It uses a general pattern of argumentation\n(logos) that makes an inference from particular alleged facts\nabout the universe (cosmos) to the existence of a unique\nbeing, generally identified with or referred to as God. Among these\ninitial facts are that particular beings or events in the universe are\ncausally dependent or contingent, that the universe (as the totality\nof contingent things) is contingent in that it could have been other\nthan it is or not existed at all, that the Big Conjunctive Contingent\nFact possibly has an explanation, or that the universe came into\nbeing. From these facts philosophers and theologians argue\ndeductively, inductively, or abductively by inference to the best\nexplanation that a first cause, sustaining cause, unmoved mover,\nnecessary being, or personal being (God) exists that caused and/or\nsustains the universe. The cosmological argument is part of classical\nnatural theology, whose goal is to provide evidence for the claim that\nGod exists, although contemporary treatments of it generally occur\noutside of considerations of natural theology but have generated a\ncottage industry of their own.\n\nOn the one hand, the argument arises from human curiosity as to why\nthere is something rather than nothing or than something else. It\ninvokes a concern for some full, complete, ultimate, or best\nexplanation of what exists contingently. On the other hand, it raises\nintrinsically important philosophical questions about contingency and\nnecessity, causation and explanation, part/whole relationships\n(mereology), possible worlds, infinity, sets, the nature of time, and\nthe nature and origin of the universe. In what follows we will first\nsketch out a very brief history of the argument, note the two basic\ntypes of deductive cosmological arguments, and then provide a careful\nanalysis of examples of each: first, three arguments from contingency,\none based on a relatively strong version of the principle of\nsufficient reason and two others based respectively on a very strong\nand on a weak version of that principle; and second, an argument from\nthe alleged fact that the universe had a beginning and the\nimpossibility of an infinite temporal regress of causes. In the end we\nwill consider an inductive version of the cosmological argument and\nwhat it is to be a necessary being.\n", "toc": [{"#HistOver": "1. Historical Overview"}, {"#TypoCosmArgu": "2.

Historical Overview\n\nAlthough in Western philosophy the earliest formulation of a version\nof the cosmological argument is found in Plato\u2019s Laws,\n893\u201396, the classical argument is firmly rooted in\nAristotle\u2019s Physics (VIII, 4\u20136) and\nMetaphysics (XII, 1\u20136). Islamic philosophy enriches the\ntradition, developing two types of arguments. Arabic philosophers\n(falasifa), such as Ibn Sina (c. 980\u20131037), developed\nthe argument from contingency, which was taken up by Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u201374) in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3) and in\nhis Summa Contra Gentiles (I, 13). Influenced by the\nNeoplatonist John Philoponus (5th c) (Davidson 1969), the\nmutakallim\u016bm\u2014theologians who used reason and\nargumentation to support their revealed Islamic\nbeliefs\u2014developed the temporal version of the argument from the\nimpossibility of an infinite regress, now referred to as the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument. For example,\nal-Gh\u0101z\u0101li (1058\u20131111) argued that everything that\nbegins to exist requires a cause of its beginning. The world is\ncomposed of temporal phenomena preceded by other temporally-ordered\nphenomena. Since such a series of temporal phenomena cannot continue\nto infinity because an actual infinite is impossible, the world must\nhave had a beginning and a cause of its existence, termed Allah or God\n(Craig 1979: part 1). This version of the cosmological argument\nentered the medieval Christian tradition through Bonaventure\n(1221\u201374) in his Sentences (II Sent.\nD.1,p.1,a.1,q.2).\n\nEnlightenment thinkers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Samuel\nClarke, reaffirmed the cosmological argument. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) appealed to a strengthened principle of sufficient\nreason, according to which \u201cno fact can be real or existing and\nno statement true without a sufficient reason for its being so and not\notherwise\u201d (Monadology, \u00a732). Leibniz uses the\nprinciple to argue that the sufficient reason for the \u201cseries of\nthings comprehended in the universe of creatures\u201d (\u00a736)\nmust exist outside this series of contingencies and is found in a\nnecessary being that we call God (\u00a738). Samuel Clarke likewise\nemployed the principle of sufficient reason in his cosmological\nargument (Rowe 1975: chap. 2).\n\nAlthough the cosmological argument does not figure prominently in\nAsian philosophy, a very abbreviated version of it, proceeding from\ndependence, can be found in Udayana\u2019s\nNy\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali I,4. In general,\nphilosophers in the Ny\u0101ya tradition argue that since the universe\nhas parts that come into existence at one occasion and not another, it\nmust have a cause. We could admit an infinite regress of causes if we\nhad evidence for such, but lacking such evidence, God must exist as\nthe non-dependent cause. Many of the objections to the argument\ncontend that God is an inappropriate cause because of God\u2019s\nnature. For example, since God is immobile and has no body, he cannot\nproperly be said to cause anything. The Naiy\u0101yikas reply that God\ncould assume a body at certain times, and in any case, God need not\ncreate in the same way humans do (Potter 1977: 100\u201307).\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes advances his version of the cosmological\nargument not only as a piece of natural theology that proves\nGod\u2019s existence by natural reason, but also serving an epistemic\nfunction of guaranteeing that God could not be deceiving him\n(Meditations on First Philosophy, Preface & Meditation\n3). The cosmological argument came under serious assault in the\n18th century, first by David Hume and then by Immanuel Kant.\nHume (1748) attacked both the view of causation presupposed in the\nargument (that causation is an objective, productive, necessary power\nrelation that holds between two things) and the Causal\nPrinciple\u2014every contingent being has a cause of its\nexistence\u2014that lies at the heart of the argument. Kant contended\nthat the cosmological argument, in identifying the necessary being,\nrelies on the ontological argument, which in turn is suspect. We will\nreturn to these criticisms below.\n\nIn the first part of the 20th century, with the rise of Positivism,\nthe argument was largely abandoned. For critics like J.J.C. Smart\n(1955), the claim of the cosmological argument that God necessarily\nexists is equivalent to \u201cNecessarily, God exists.\u201d But\nsince existence claims cannot be logically necessary, the statement is\nabsurd. However, he notes, within us lies a deep-seated question: why\nshould anything exist at all? Smart does not know what sort of\nquestion this is for it fails to fit his conception of propositions as\neither necessary truths or empirical claims. However, he continues,\nthis awe-inspiring theological question appeals to those with a\nreligious attitude. In this, the cosmological argument is reduced to a\nmystical role, catering to our emotions but devoid of rational\ncontent.\n\nBoth theists and nontheists in the last part of the 20th\ncentury and the first part of the 21st century generally\nshow a healthy skepticism about the argument. Alvin Plantinga\nconcludes \u201cthat this piece of natural theology is\nineffective\u201d (1967: chap. 1), and from his later Reformed\nEpistemology, it is unnecessary since belief in God can be properly\nbasic. Richard Gale contends, in Kantian fashion, that since the\nconclusion of all versions of the cosmological argument invokes an\nimpossibility, no cosmological arguments can provide examples of sound\nreasoning (1991: chap. 7). (However, Gale seems to have changed his\nmind and in recent writings proposed and defended his own version of\nthe cosmological argument, which we will consider below.) Similarly,\nMichael Martin (1990: chap. 4), John Mackie (1982: chap. 5), Quentin\nSmith (Craig and Smith 1993), Bede Rundle (2004), Wes Morriston (2000,\n2002a, 2003, 2010), and Graham Oppy (2006: chap. 3), among numerous\nothers, reason that no current version of the cosmological argument is\nsound or provides probabilistic evidence. Yet dissenting voices can be\nheard. Robert Koons (1997) employs mereology and modal and\nnonmonotonic logic in taking a \u201cnew look\u201d at the argument\nfrom contingency. In his widely discussed writings William Lane Craig\nmarshals multidisciplinary evidence for the truth of the premises\nfound in the kal\u0101m argument. Richard Gale and Alexander\nPruss propose a version based on a so-called weak principle of\nsufficient reason that leads to a finite God that is not\nomnibenevolent, while Michael Almeida constructs a version of the\nargument based on modal realism and a strong principle of sufficient\nreason. Richard Swinburne, though rejecting deductive versions of the\ncosmological argument, proposes an inductive argument that is part of\na larger cumulative case for God\u2019s existence. \n\n\nThere is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something\nof the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is very unlikely that\na universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would\nexist uncaused. The existence of the universe\u2026can be made\ncomprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God.\n(Swinburne 1979: 131\u201332) \n\n\nIn short, in contrast to the first half of the last century,\ncontemporary philosophers contribute increasingly detailed, complex,\nand sophisticated arguments on both sides of the debate, some\nconnected to natural theology, many others unconnected but important\nfor their philosophically complex and subtle reasoning.\n2. Typology of Cosmological Arguments\n\nPhilosophers employ diverse classifications of the cosmological\narguments. Swinburne distinguishes inductive from deductive versions.\nCraig distinguishes three types of deductive cosmological arguments in\nterms of their approach to an infinite regress of causes. The first,\nadvocated by Aquinas, is based on the impossibility of an essentially\nordered infinite regress. The second, which Craig terms the\nkal\u0101m argument, holds that an infinite temporal regress\nof causes is impossible because an actual infinite is impossible, and\neven if it were possible it could not be temporally realized. The\nthird, espoused by Leibniz and Clarke, is overtly founded on the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (Craig 1980: 282\u201383), although it\nappears that all versions use some form of that principle. Craig notes\nthat the distinction between these types of arguments is important\nbecause the objections raised against one version may be irrelevant to\nother versions. So, for example, a critique of a particular version of\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), which one finds developed by\nWilliam Rowe or Richard Gale, might not be telling against the\nThomistic or kal\u0101m versions of the argument. Another way\nof distinguishing between versions of the argument is in terms of the\nrelevance of time to the argument. In Aquinas\u2019s version,\nconsideration of the essential ordering of the causes or reasons\nproceeds independent of temporal concerns. The relationship between\ncause and effect is treated as real but not temporal, so that the\nfirst cause is not a first cause in time but a sustaining cause\n(Siniscalchi 2018: 691). In the kal\u0101m version, however,\nthe temporal ordering of the causal sequence is central, introducing\nissues of the nature of time into the discussion.\n3. Complexity of the Question\n\nIt is said that philosophy begins in wonder. Thus it was for the\npre-Socratic Greeks, who wondered what constituted the basic stuff of\nthe world (\u03ba\u00f3\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) around them,\nhow this basic stuff changed into the diverse forms they experienced,\nand how it came to be. These origination questions related to the\npuzzle of existence that, in its metaphysical dimensions, is the\nsubject of our concern.\n\nFirst, why is there anything at all? This question becomes clearer\nwhen put in contrastive form, Why is there something rather than\nnothing? We can ask this question even in the absence of contingent\nbeings, though in this context it is likely to prove unanswerable. For\nexample, if God or the universe is logically or absolutely necessary,\nit would not only exist but must exist even if nothing else existed.\nProbably no reason can be given for why logically or absolutely\nnecessary things exist, if they do at all. (Almeida disagrees; see his\nargument below.)\n\nSome doubt whether we can ask this question because there being\nnothing is not an option. John Heil asks, \u201cWhat exactly is\nnothing at all? What would nothing be?\u201d (Heil\n2013: 174). He analogizes nothing with the notion of empty space, in\nterms of which, he thinks, we can conceptualize nothing. He reasons\nthat we cannot achieve a notion of empty space simply by removing the\nuniverse\u2019s contents one at a time, for space (the void) would\nstill exist. However, we need not analogize nothing in terms of empty\nspace, and even if we do, we surely can conceive of removing space. If\nwe think of space as a particular type of relation between objects,\nthe removal of all objects (everything) would leave nothing, including\nrelations. The key point is that \u201cleaving nothing\u201d is not\nto be understood in the sense that nothing is or has existence. We can\neasily be misled by the language of there being nothing at\nall, leading to the notion that nothing has being or existence. Heil\nsuggests that nothing might be a precursor to the Big Bang. However,\nthis too is a misconception\u2014though one widely held by those who\nthink that the universe arose out of nothing, e.g., a vacuum\nfluctuation. A vacuum fluctuation is itself not nothing \u201cbut is\na sea of fluctuating energy endowed with a rich structure and subject\nto physical laws\u201d (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 183, 191). The\ncontrastive question is comprehensible: \u201cWhy is there something\nrather than there never having been anything whatsoever?\u201d\n\nRutten (2012, 13\u201315, see Other Internet Resources) develops an\na priori reductio ad absurdum argument for the\nimpossibility of there being nothing. Suppose nothing exists. If\nnothing exists, then no actual states of affairs exist, and if no\nactual states of affairs exist, no merely possible states of affairs\nexist, since (on an Aristotelean model) there is nothing to actualize\nthem or bring them about. Hence, if nothing exists, there are no\npossible states of affairs, since to be possible, something must\neither be actual or merely possible. (This is consistent with the\ntheists\u2019 contention that out of nothing nothing can come.)\nHowever, one can conceive of a possible world with at least one actual\nand hence possible state of affairs S, for example, a world\nwith one atom. But, Rutten notes, on the S5 axiom system of modal\nlogic (see the entry on\n modal logic),\n all possible worlds are connected. Hence, if S is\nmetaphysically possible in one world, S is metaphysically\npossible in all possible worlds. That is, S is necessarily\npossible. However, this contradicts the original conclusion that if\ntotal nothingness is metaphysically possible, there are no possible\nstates of affairs in that possible world. Hence, there is a\nreductio against the original thesis that there can be\nnothingness. One might counter this reductio not only by questioning\nthe principle that what is metaphysically possible in one world is so\nin every world, but also by contending that the argument trades on a\nconfusion between metaphysical necessity, as evidenced by appeal to an\nAristotelian principle regarding the relationship between actuality\nand possibility, with logical necessity, which in invoking the S5\nmodal system addresses logical possibility across possible worlds (for\nthis distinction, see Burgess 1999, 81). \n\nSecond, why are there these particular contingent beings? The\nstarting point here is the existence of particular things, and the\nquestion posed asks for an explanation for there being these\nparticular things. If we are looking for a causal explanation and\naccept a full explanation (in terms of contemporary or\nimmediately prior causal conditions and the relevant natural laws that\ntogether necessitate the effect), the answer emerges from an analysis\nof the relevant immediate causal conditions present in each case. Hume\nargues that an explanation in terms of temporally conjoined factors is\nall that is necessary for a satisfactory explanation. In contrast,\nO\u2019Connor treats this formulation of the question as the basis\nfor his construction of a cosmological argument for the existence of\nan absolutely necessary being (2008: 65). \n\nHeil suggests that the answer depends on how one understands the Big\nBang (2013: 178). If it was spontaneous, the question has no answer.\nIf not spontaneous, there might be an answer. Theists broaden the\nexplanatory search to include final causes or intentions appropriate\nto a personal cause. It leads us to ask the question, \u201cSupposing\nthat God exists, why did God bring about contingent beings?\u201d\nThis assumes that God exists and now inquires about the reasons for\ncreation. On the one hand, we might argue that this question is\nunanswerable in that only God would know his reasons for bringing the\nuniverse into existence (O\u2019Connor 2008). On the other hand, God\nacts out of his nature; Swinburne (2004: 47, 114\u201323) emphasizes\nGod\u2019s goodness, from which we can infer possible reasons for\nwhat God brings about (although at this point the problem of evil has\nbite). God also acts from his intentions (Swinburne 1993:\n139\u201345; 2007: 83\u201384), so that God could reveal his\npurposes for his act of creating (Richard Swinburne, The Evolution\nof the Soul: 309).\n\nThird, why do things continue to exist? This is the question that\nThomas Aquinas posed. Aquinas was interested not in a beginning cause\nbut in a sustaining cause, for he believed that the universe could be\neternal\u2014although he believed on the basis of revelation that it\nwas not eternal. He constructed his cosmological arguments around the\nquestion of what sustains things in the universe in their\nexistence.\n\nFourth, if the universe has a beginning, what is the cause of that\nbeginning? This is the question that is addressed by the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, given its central premise\nthat everything that begins to exist has a cause. Many, however, deny\nthe antecedent in the conditional, that the universe had a\nbeginning.\n\nFifth and fundamentally, why are there contingent beings? This may be\nasked about particular finite beings and, if the universe is\ncontingent, the universe. Several responses have been given. One is\nthat particular things exist because of their causes, and their causes\nbecause of their causes, and so on. Had those causes not existed, the\neffect in question would not exist. If one speaks about the universe,\nthen either it exists because it is caused (e.g., brought about by the\nintentional act of a supernatural being) or it is inexplicable (the\nuniverse just exists; its existence is a brute fact; it has always\nexisted, though perhaps through many phases). This is the question\nthat traditional cosmological arguments connected to natural theology\naddress.\n\nTwo things should be obvious from this discussion. First, questions\nabout existence are more nuanced than usually addressed (Heil 2013:\n177). It is important to be more precise about what one is asking when\none asks this broader metaphysical question about why there is\nsomething rather than nothing. Second, the cosmological argument lies\nat the heart of attempts to answer the questions, and to this we now\nturn.\n4. Argument for a Non-contingent Cause\n\nThomas Aquinas held that among the things whose existence needs\nexplanation are contingent beings that depend for their existence upon\nother beings. Richard Taylor (1992: 84\u201394) discusses the\nargument in terms of the world (\u201ceverything that ever does\nexist, except God, in case there is a god\u201d, 1992: 87) being\ncontingent and thus needing explanation. Arguing that the term\n\u201cuniverse\u201d refers to an abstract entity or set, William\nRowe rephrases the issue, \u201cWhy does that set (the universe) have\nthe members that it does rather than some other members or none at\nall?\u201d (Rowe 1975: 136). Put broadly, \u201cWhy is there\nanything at all?\u201d (Smart, in Smart and Haldane, 1996: 35; Rundle\n2004). The response of defenders of the cosmological argument is that\nwhat is contingent exists because of some action of a necessary\nbeing.\n4.1 A Deductive Argument from Contingency\n\nAs an a posteriori argument, the cosmological argument begins\nwith a fact known by experience, namely, that something contingent\nexists. We might sketch out a version of the argument as follows.\n\nA contingent being (a being such that if it exists, it\ncould have not-existed) exists.\n All contingent beings have a sufficient cause of or\nfully adequate explanation for their existence.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation\nfor the existence of contingent beings is something other than the\ncontingent being itself.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation\nfor the existence of contingent beings must either be solely other\ncontingent beings or include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\nContingent beings alone cannot provide a sufficient\ncause of or fully adequate explanation for the existence of contingent\nbeings. \nTherefore, what sufficiently causes or fully\nadequately explains the existence of contingent beings must include a\nnon-contingent (necessary) being.\nTherefore, a necessary being (a being such that if it\nexists, it cannot not-exist) exists.\nThe universe, which is composed of only contingent\nbeings, is contingent.\nTherefore, the necessary being is something other than\nthe universe. (For a Thomistic version of this argument, see\nSiniscalchi 2018: 690\u201393). \n\n\nIn the argument, steps 1\u20137 establish the existence of a\nnecessary or non-contingent being; steps 8\u20139 attempt in some way\nto identify it.\n\nOver the centuries philosophers have suggested various instantiations\nfor the contingent being noted in\n premise 1.\n In his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3), Aquinas argued that we\nneed a causal explanation for things in motion, things that are\ncaused, and contingent\n beings.[1]\n Others, such as Richard Swinburne (2004), propose that the contingent\nbeing referred to in premise 1 is the universe. The connection between\nthe two is supplied by John Duns Scotus, who argued that even if the\nessentially ordered causes were infinite, \u201cthe whole series of\neffects would be dependent upon some prior cause\u201d (Scotus [c.\n1300] 1964: I,D.2,p.1,q.1,\u00a753). Richard Gale (1999) calls this\nthe \u201cBig Conjunctive Contingent Fact\u201d. Whereas the\ncontingency of particular existents is generally undisputed, not the\nleast because of our mortality, the contingency of the universe\ndeserves serious defense (see\n section 4.2).\n Premise 2 invokes a moderate version of the Principle of Causation,\naccording to which there must be a sufficient cause for any contingent\nbeing or event, or of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, according to\nwhich there must be a fully adequate explanation for any contingent\nbeing or event. Applied here, the Principles of Causation or of\nSufficient Reason support the contention that if something is\ncontingent, there must be a sufficient cause of its existence or a\nfully adequate reason or explanation why it exists rather than not\nexists. The point of\n premise 3\n is simply that something cannot cause or explain its own existence,\nfor this would require it to already exist (in a logical if not in a\ntemporal sense).\n Premise 4\n is true by virtue of the Principle of Excluded Middle: what explains\nthe existence of the contingent being either are solely other\ncontingent beings or include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\n Conclusions 6\n and\n 7\n follow validly from the respective premises.\n\nFor many critics,\n premise 5\n (along with\n premise 2)\n holds the key to the argument\u2019s success or failure. The truth\nof 5 depends upon the requirements for an adequate explanation. Using\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), what is required here is an\naccount in terms of sufficient conditions that provides an adequate\nexplanation why the cause had the effect it did, or alternatively, why\nthis particular effect and not another arose. Swinburne (2004:\n75\u201379), and Alexander Pruss (2006: 16\u201318) after him, note\ndiverse kinds of explanations. In a full explanation the\ncausal factors\u2014in scientific causation, contemporary or\nimmediately precedent causal conditions and natural laws; in personal\ncausation, persons and their intentions\u2014 are sufficient for the\noccurrence of an event. They \u201ctogether necessitate the\noccurrence of the effect\u201d (Swinburne 2004: 76). \n\n\nIt does not allow a puzzling aspect of the explanandum to disappear:\nanything puzzling in the explanandum is either also found in the\nexplanans or else explained by the explanans. (Pruss 2006: 17) \n\n\nIt suffices to explain why something comes about given the immediately\npresent causal conditions but leaves unexplained why those explanatory\ncausal conditions and/or reasons themselves hold.\n\nIn a complete explanation, every aspect of the explanandum\nand explanans at the time of the occurrence is accounted for; nothing\npuzzling remains. \n\nA complete explanation of the occurrence of E is a full\nexplanation of its occurrence in which all the factors cited are such\nthat there is no [further] explanation (either full or partial) of\ntheir existence of operation in terms of factors operative at the time\nof their existence or operation. (Swinburne 2004: 78)\n\n\nPruss and Swinburne argue that the kind of explanation required by the\nPSR is a complete explanation.\n\nQuinn argues that an adequate explanation need not require a complete\nexplanation (2005: 584\u201385); a partial explanation might do just\nas well, depending on the context. Among these adequate explanations\nof why this actual world obtains rather than another possible world\n(including one with no contingent beings) is that the universe is an\ninexplicable brute fact or that God strongly actualized the world\n(although not everything in it). He refuses to take sides on the\ndebate between explanations, except to say that science cannot provide\nan adequate explanation if the explanatory chain is infinite, for the\nchain of causes is itself contingent or it ends in an initial\ncontingency not scientifically accountable. However, not only does\nQuinn not clarify what constitutes an adequate explanation, but as\nPruss contends, the PSR \u201cis not compatible with an infinite\nchain of explanations that has no ultimate explanans\u201d (2006:\n17), for in an infinite chain something puzzling remains to be\nexplained, with the result that the PSR would again be invoked to\nexplain what is puzzling. However, as we will question below, is the\nbrute fact of the universe any more unacceptable as a complete\nexplanation than the brute fact of a necessary being (God)?\n\nOne worry with understanding the PSR in this way is that it may lead\nto a deterministic account that not only may bode ill for the success\nof the argument but on a libertarian account may be incompatible with\nthe contention that God created freely. Pruss, however, envisions no\nsuch difficulty, for giving reasons neither makes the event\ndeterministic nor removes freedom. \n\n\nWhat gives sufficiency to explanation is that mystery is taken away,\nfor example, through the citing of relevant reasons, not that\nprobability is increased.... Once we have said that \\(x\\) freely chose\n\\(A\\) for \\(R\\), then the only thing left that is unexplained is why\n\\(x\\) existed and was both free and attracted by \\(R\\). (Pruss 2006:\n157,158) \n\n\nOne might reply that an explanation needs to be given for why \\(x\\)\nwas attracted to \\(R_1\\) rather than to \\(R_2\\), and that if that\nexplanation is given, \\(x\\)\u2019s choice is not free but determined\nby the degree to which \\(x\\) is attracted to different reasons.\nHowever, Pruss might respond that being \u201cattracted by\u201d is\nnot to be understood in any deterministic sense. One might freely\nconsider an option to be the best without being necessitated to choose\nit. The debate hinges on how one understands how reasons function in\nhuman agency. \n\nFinally, some (disputedly, see below) argue that explanations must be\neither natural (impersonal) or non-natural (personal).\n 8\n &\n 9\n assert that if the contingent being identified in\n 1\n is the universe, given that the universe encompasses all natural\nexistents and the laws and principles governing them, the explanation\nmust be in terms of a non-natural, eternal, necessary being that\nprovides an intentional, personal, ultimate explanation. Since the\nargument proceeds independent of temporal considerations, the argument\ndoes not necessarily propose a first cause in time, but allows for a\nfirst or primary sustaining cause of the universe. As Aquinas noted,\nthe philosophical arguments for God\u2019s existence as first cause\nare compatible with the eternity of the universe (On the Eternity\nof the World), although he rejects the latter based on divine\nrevelation.\n\nWhether 8 and 9 are an intrinsic part of the cosmological argument is\ndebated. Kant argued that the argument had two parts, the first\nestablishing the existence of an absolutely necessary being; the\nsecond part, identifying this being as the most real being (1787,\nB633\u201340). Without the second part, the concept of a necessary\nbeing was empty. The issue achieves significance when the question\narises whether the argument has religious significance, that is,\nwhether necessary being to which the argument concludes is God. Some\ncontend that from the concept of a necessary being flow properties\nappropriate to a divine being (Siniscalchi 2018, 693). Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (2004) argues that being a necessary being cannot be a\nderivative emergent property, otherwise the being would be contingent.\nLikewise, the connection between the essential properties must be\nnecessary. Hence, the universe cannot be the necessary being since it\nis mereologically complex. Similarly, the myriad elementary particles\ncannot be necessary beings either, for their distinguishing\ndistributions are externally caused and hence contingent. Rather, he\ncontends that a more viable account of the necessary being is as a\npurposive agent with desires, intentions, and beliefs, whose activity\nis guided but not determined by its goals, a view consistent with\nidentifying the necessary being as God. Koons (as are Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 192\u201394) is willing to identify the necessary\nbeing as God. He identifies seven corollaries regarding God\u2019s\nnature that follow from his mereological construction of the\ncosmological argument (e.g., God as the necessary being is not a mere\naggregate or composite; has its basic attributes by necessity; is not\nessentially located in space or time; etc. (1997). Oppy (1999,\n381\u201384), on the other hand, in critiquing Koons\u2019s\npresentation \u201cof seven corollaries to his (cosmological) proof\nwhich are intended to establish that the First Cause has at least some\nof the attributes which are traditionally attributed to God,\u201d\nexpresses significant skepticism about Koons\u2019s arguments and the\npossibility of such a deductive move to determine its properties.\n\nCritics have objected to key premises in the argument. We will\nconsider the most important objections and responses.\n4.2 Objection 1: The Universe Just Is\n\nInterpreting the contingent being in\n premise 1\n as the universe, Bertrand Russell denies that the universe needs an\nexplanation\n (premise 2);\n it just is. Russell, following Hume (1779), contends that since we\nderive the concept of cause from our observation of particular things,\nwe cannot ask about the cause of something like the universe that we\ncannot experience. The universe needs no explanation; it is\n\u201cjust there, and that\u2019s all\u201d (Russell 1948 [1964]:\n175). This view was reiterated by Hawking (1987: 651).\n\nSwinburne replies that \n\n\nuniqueness is relative to description. Every physical object is unique\nunder some description,\u2026 yet all objects within the universe\nare characterized by certain properties, which are common to more than\none object.\u2026 The objection fails to make any crucial\ndistinction between the universe and other objects; and so it fails in\nits attempt to prevent at the outset a rational inquiry into the issue\nof whether the universe has some origin outside itself. (Swinburne\n2004: 134\u201335) \n\n\nWe do not need to experience every possible referent of the class of\ncontingent things to be able to conclude that a contingent thing needs\na cause. \u201cTo know that a rubber ball dropped on a Tuesday in\nWaggener Hall by a redheaded tuba player will fall to the\nground\u201d, I do not need a sample that includes tuba players\ndropping rubber balls at this location (Koons 1997: 202).\n\nMorriston (2002a: 235) responds that although it is true that we do\nnot need to experience every instance to derive a general principle,\nthe universe is a very different thing from what we experientially\nreference when we say that things cannot come into existence without a\ncause. Tuba players are not \u201canything remotely analogous to the\n\u2018initial singularity\u2019 that figures in the Big Bang theory\nof the origin of the universe\u201d.\n\nDefenders of the argument respond that there is a key similarity\nbetween the cosmos and its content, namely, both are contingent.\nHowever, why should we think that the cosmos is contingent? Defenders\nof the view contend that if the components of the universe are\ncontingent, the universe itself is contingent. Russell replies that\nthe move from the contingency of the components of the universe to the\ncontingency of the universe commits the Fallacy of Composition, which\nmistakenly concludes that since the parts have a certain property, the\nwhole likewise has that property. Hence, whereas we legitimately can\nask for the cause of particular things, to require a cause of the\nuniverse based on the contingency of its parts is mistaken.\n\nRussell correctly notes that arguments of the part-whole type can\ncommit the Fallacy of Composition. For example, the argument that\nsince all the bricks in the wall are small, the wall is small, is\nfallacious. Yet it is an informal fallacy of content, not a formal\nfallacy. Sometimes the totality has the same quality as the parts\nbecause of the nature of the parts invoked\u2014the wall is brick\n(composed of baked clay) because it is built of bricks (composed of\nbaked clay). The universe\u2019s contingency, theists argue,\nresembles the second case. If all the contingent things in the\nuniverse, including matter and energy, ceased to exist simultaneously,\nthe universe itself, as the totality of these things, would cease to\nexist. However, if the universe can cease to exist, it is contingent\nand requires an explanation for its existence (Reichenbach 1972: chap.\n5).\n\nIt is worth noting that on the one hand, \u201cuniverse\u201d can\nrefer to what is spatio-temporally connected to us. On the other hand,\n\u201cuniverse\u201d can refer to the totality of contingent beings\n(Oppy 1999: 384). This argument for the contingency of the universe\nfrom its component, contingent parts coalesces these two\nunderstandings in the cosmological argument. \n\nWhether this argument for the contingency of the universe is similar\nto that advanced by Aquinas in his Third Way depends on how one\ninterprets Aquinas\u2019s argument. Aquinas holds that \u201cif\neverything can not-be, then at one time there was nothing in\nexistence\u201d (ST I,q.2,a.3). William Rowe (1975:\n160\u201367) argues that what looks like a similar argument in Samuel\nClarke for the contingency of the universe is fallacious, for even if\nevery contingent being were to fail to exist in some possible world,\nit may be the case that there is no possible world that lacks a\ncontingent being (on Aquinas, see Plantinga 1967: 5\u20136; Kenny\n1969: 56\u201366). That is, although no being would exist in every\npossible world, every possible world could possess at least one\ncontingent being. In such a case, although each being is contingent,\nsomething must exist. Rowe gives the example of a horse race. \n\n\nWe know that although no horse in a given horse race necessarily will\nbe the winner, it is, nevertheless, necessary that some horse in the\nrace will be the winner. (1975: 164)\n\n\nRowe\u2019s example will work only if it is necessary that some horse\nwill finish the race, for otherwise it is possible that all the horses\nbreak a leg and none finishes the race\u2014a condition he notes in\nthat \u201cit is necessary that there exists at least one member of\nthe collection\u201d. So why should we think that something must\nexist, even if it is contingent? Rowe does not say why, but one\nargument given in defense of this thesis is that the existence of one\ncontingent being may be necessary for the nonexistence of some other\ncontingent being. However, although the fact that something\u2019s\nexistence is necessary for the non-existence of something else holds\nfor certain relational properties (for example, the existence of a\nspouse is necessary for a man not to be a bachelor), it is doubtful\nthat something\u2019s existence is necessary for the non-existence of\nsomething else per se, which is what is needed to support the\nargument that denies the contingency of the universe.\n\nHaldane (Smart and Haldane 1996: 132) defends the cogency of\nAquinas\u2019s reasoning on the grounds that Aquinas\u2019s argument\nis fallacious only on a temporal reading, but Aquinas\u2019s argument\nemploys an atemporal ordering of contingent beings. That is, Aquinas\ndoes not hold that over time there would be nothing, but that in the\nper se ordering of causes, if every contingent thing in that order did\nnot exist, there would be nothing.\n\nRowe (1975: 166) develops a different argument to support the thesis\nthat the universe must be contingent. He argues that it is necessary\nthat if God exists, then it is possible that no dependent beings\nexist. Since it is possible that God exists, it is possible that it is\npossible that no dependent beings exist. (This conclusion is licensed\nby the modal principle: If it is necessary that if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nthen if it is possible that \\(p\\), it is possible that \\(q\\).) Hence,\nit is possible that there are no dependent beings; that is, that the\nuniverse is contingent. Rowe takes the conditional as necessarily true\nin virtue of the classical concept of God, according to which God is\nfree to decide whether or not to create dependent beings.\n\nTo avoid any hint of the Fallacy of Composition and to avoid its\ncomplications, Koons (1997: 198\u201399) formulates the argument for\nthe contingency of the universe as a mereological argument. If\nsomething is contingent, it contains a contingent part. The whole and\npart overlap and, by virtue of overlapping, have a common part. Since\nthe part in virtue of which they overlap is wholly contingent, the\nwhole likewise must be contingent.\n\nOne might approach Russell\u2019s thesis regarding the brute fact of\nthe universe from a different direction. If theists are willing to\naccept the existence of God as the necessary being as a brute fact,\nwhy cannot nontheists accept the existence of the universe as a brute\nfact, as a necessary being? Bede Rundle, for example, argues that what\nhas necessary existence is causally independent. Matter has necessary\nexistence, for although it undergoes change as manifested in\nparticular bits of matter, the given volume of matter found in the\nuniverse persists, and as persisting matter/energy does not have or\nneed a cause. This accords with the Principle of Conservation of\nMass-Energy, according to which matter and energy are never lost but\nrather transmute into each other. As indestructible, matter/energy is\nthe necessary being. Consequently, although the material components of\nthe universe are contingent vis-\u00e0-vis their form, they\nare necessary vis-\u00e0-vis their existence. On this\nreading, there is not one but there are many necessary beings, all\ninternal to the universe. Their particular configurations are\ncontingent, but since matter/energy is conserved it cannot be created\nor lost.\n\nInterestingly enough, this approach was anticipated by Aquinas in his\nthird way in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3). Once Aquinas\nconcludes that necessary beings exist, he then goes on to ask whether\nthese beings have their existence from themselves or from another. If\nfrom another, then we have an unsatisfactory infinite regress of\nexplanations. Hence, there must be something whose necessity is\nuncaused. As Kenny points out, Aquinas understands this necessity in\nterms of being unable to cease to exist (Kenny 1969: 48). Although\nAquinas understands the uncaused necessary being to be God, Rundle\ntakes this to be matter/energy itself.\n\nOne question that arises with Rundle\u2019s view is whether there\ncould have been more or less matter/energy than there is. That is, if\nthere is \\(n\\) amount of matter/energy in the world, could there be a\npossible world with \\(+n\\) or \\(-n\\) amounts of matter/energy? We do\nnot know how much matter/energy existed in the first \\(10^{-35}\\)\nseconds of the universe. Even if the universe currently operates\naccording to the principle of the Conservation of Matter and Energy,\nRundle\u2019s thesis depends on the contention that during the very\nearly phase of rapid expansion, a period of time we know little about,\nthis principle held. A second significant problem concerns what\nfollows from the existence of necessary beings. If the matter/energy\nnexus constitutes the necessary being, what causally follows from that\nnexus is itself necessary, and contingency, even in the composing\nrelations within the universe, would disappear. Everything in the\nuniverse would be necessary, which is a disquieting position. Third,\nO\u2019Connor (2004) argues that since the necessary being provides\nthe ultimate explanation, there is no explanation of the\ndifferentiation of the kinds of matter or of contingencies that\nmatter/energy causally undergo, for example, in terms of space-time\nlocation. We will return to the question of the contingency of the\nuniverse below.\n4.3 Objection 2: Explaining the Individual Constituents Is Sufficient\n\nWhereas Russell argued that the universe just is, David Hume held that\nwhen the parts are explained the whole is explained.\n\n\nBut the whole, you say, wants a cause. I answer that the\nuniting of these parts into a whole\u2026is performed merely by an\narbitrary act of the mind, and has no influence on the nature of\nthings. Did I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in explaining the parts.\n(Hume 1779: part 9)\n\n\nHume contends that uniting the parts or individual constituents into a\nwhole is a mental act. In reality, all that exist are individual,\ncausally-related events, not whole sets of events. When we have\nprovided an account of each of these individual, causally-related\nevents we have explained the whole. We don\u2019t need anything\nmore.\n\nRowe objects to what he terms the Hume-Edwards principle\u2014that by\nexplaining the parts we have explained the whole:\n\n\nWhen the existence of each member of a collection is explained by\nreference to some other member of that very same collection,\nthen it does not follow that the collection itself has an explanation.\nFor it is one thing for there to be an explanation of the existence of\neach dependent being and quite another thing for there to be an\nexplanation of why there are dependent beings at all. (Rowe 1975:\n264)\n\n\nPruss (1999) expands on Rowe\u2019s argument. An explanation of the\nparts may provide a partial but not a complete explanation. The\nexplanation in terms of parts may fail to explain why these parts\nexist rather than others, why they exist rather than not, or why the\nparts are arranged as they are. Each member or part will be explained\neither in terms of itself or in terms of something else that is\ncontingent. The former would make them necessary, not contingent,\nbeings. If they are explained in terms of something else, they still\nremain unaccounted for, since the explanation would invoke either an\ninfinite regress of causes or a circular explanation. Pruss employs\nthe chicken/egg sequence: chickens account for eggs, which account for\nchickens, and so on where the two are paired. However, appealing to an\ninfinite chicken/egg regress or else arguing in a circle explains\nneither any given chicken nor egg.\n\nRichard Swinburne notes that an explanation is complete when\n\u201cany attempt to go beyond the factors which we have would result\nin no gain of explanatory power or prior probability\u201d (2004:\n89). However, explaining why something exists rather than something\nelse or than nothing and why it is as it is gives additional\nexplanatory power in explaining why a universe exists at all. Gale\n(1991: 257\u201358) concludes that if we are to explain the parts of\nthe universe and their specific concatenation, we must appeal to\nsomething other than those parts.\n4.4 Objection 3: The Principles of Causation and Sufficient Reason Are Suspect\n\nCritics of the cosmological argument contend that the Causal Principle\nor, where applicable, the broader Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)\nthat underlies versions of the argument, is suspect. As Hume argued,\nthere is no reason for thinking that the Causal Principle is true\na priori, for we can conceive of events occurring without\nconceiving of their being caused, and what is conceivable is possible\nin reality (1748: IV). Neither can an argument for the application of\nthe Causal Principle to the universe be drawn from inductive\nexperience. Even if the Causal Principle applies to events in the\nworld, we cannot extrapolate from the way the world works to the world\nas a whole (Mackie 1982: 85; Kant 1787: B638).\n\nSeveral replies are in order. First, Hume\u2019s conceivability to\npossibility argument is unsound. For one thing, whose conceivability\nis being appealed to here? For another, someone who fails to\nunderstand a necessarily true proposition might conceive of it being\nfalse, but from this it does not follow that it possibly is false. A\nperson might think (wrongly) that pi is a determinate number,\nbut it does not follow that it is so. In the phenomenology of\nconceivability, what is really conceivable is difficult if not\nimpossible to differentiate from what some might think is conceivable.\nAnd even if something is conceivable, say in a logical sense, it does\nnot follow that it is metaphysically or factually possible. One might\nconceive that, since heads can be distinguished from tails on a coin,\nthey can actually be separated, but metaphysically such is impossible.\nWhat is distinguishable is not necessarily separable. Hume, it seems,\nconfuses epistemic with ontological conditions. Hence, the argument\nbased on conceivability is suspect (Reichenbach 1972:\n57\u201360).\n\nSecond, some suggest a pragmatic-type argument to show that the Causal\nand Sufficient Reason principles are true, namely that the principles\nare necessary to make the universe intelligible. Without such\nprinciples, Pruss argues, science itself would be undercut.\n\u201cClaiming to be a brute fact should be a last resort. It would\nundercut the practice of science\u201d (Pruss 2006: 255). Utilization\nof the principles best accounts for the success of science, indeed,\nfor any investigatory endeavor (Koons 1997; see also Koons 2008:\n111\u201312, where he argues that it is \u201ca subjectively\nrequired presumption needed for immunity to internal\ndefeaters\u201d). The best explanation of the success of science and\nother such rational endeavors is that the principles really indicate\nhow reality operates.\n\nCritics reply that the principles then only have methodological or\npractical and not ontological justification. As John Mackie argues, we\nhave no right to assume that the universe complies with our\nintellectual preferences for causal order. We can simply work with\nbrute facts; beginning with them, science would work just as well.\n\nPruss goes further to suggest that the PSR in particular is\n\u201cself-evident, obvious, intuitively clear, in no need of\nargumentative support\u201d (2006: 189). For example, he holds that\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason\u2014\u201cnecessarily, every\ncontingently true proposition has an explanation\u201d (he defers on\nwhether the principle also applies to necessarily true\npropositions)\u2014is self-evident in the sense that anyone who\nunderstands it correctly understands that it is true. These persons\nmight not know it to be self-evidently true, but they do understand it\nto be true. This is consistent with other persons denying it is\nself-evident, for those who deny it might misunderstand the principle\nin various ways. \n\nThe problem with the claim of self-evidence is that it is a\nconversation ender, not a starter. One who denies its self-evidence\nmight think that those who hold to the principle are the ones who\nexperience conceptual blindness. In contrast to analyticity,\nself-evidence holds in relation to the knowers themselves, and here\nintuitions vary, perhaps according to philosophical or other types of\nperspectives. Furthermore, if the principle truly is self-evident, it\nwould be strange to respond to skeptics by attempting to give reasons\nto support that contention, and were such demanded, the request would\nitself invoke the very principle in question.\n\nPruss responds that being self-evident is not incompatible with\nproviding arguments for self-evident propositions, and he thinks that\narguments can show the truth of the PSR to those who deny its\nself-evidence. Among the numerous arguments he advances is a modal\nargument employing a Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason, according to\nwhich \u201cevery contingent proposition possibly has a complete\nexplanation\u201d (Pruss 2006: 234\u201335). We will develop this in\n section 6.\n\nPeter van Inwagen (1983: 202\u201304) argues that the PSR must be\nrejected. If the PSR is true, every contingent proposition has an\nexplanation. Suppose P is the conjunction of all contingent\ntrue propositions. Suppose also that there is a state of affairs\nS that provides a sufficient reason for P. S\ncannot itself be contingent, for then it would be a conjunct of\nP and entailed by P, and as both entailing and entailed\nby P would be P, so that it would be its own sufficient\nreason. However, no contingent proposition can explain itself. Neither\ncan S be necessary, for from necessary propositions only\nnecessary propositions follow. Necessary propositions cannot explain\ncontingent propositions, for if x sufficiently explains\ny, then x entails y, and if x is necessary\nso is y. S cannot be either contingent or necessary, and\nhence the PSR is false. Thus, if the cosmological argument appeals to\nthe PSR to establish the existence of a necessary being whose\nexistence is expressed by a necessary proposition as an explanation\nfor contingent beings, it fails in that it cannot account for the\ncontingent beings it purportedly explains. \n\nHowever, as Pruss notes (2006: chaps. 6 & 7), \u201cThe word\nsufficient can be read in two different ways: the reason\ngiven can be logically sufficient for the explanandum, or it\ncan sufficiently explain the explanandum (2006: 103).\u201d\nAccording to Pruss, we need not hold to the strong claim of logical\nsufficiency about the relation between explaining and entailment in\ncases where the explanation is brought about by libertarian free\nagency. Although God is a necessary being, his connection with the\nworld is through his free agency, and free actions explain but do not\nentail the existence of particular contingent states.\n\nClearly, the soundness of the deductive version of the cosmological\nargument hinges on whether principles like that of Causation or\nSufficient Reason are more than methodologically true and on the\nextent to which these principles can be applied to things, events, and\nfacts. Critics of the argument will be skeptical regarding the\nuniversal application of the principles; defenders of the argument\ngenerally not so, at least as limited to contingencies. Perhaps the\nbest one can say, with Taylor, is that even those who critique the PSR\n(understood broadly that every contingent thing, event, or fact must\nhave a sufficient cause, reason, or ground) invoke it when they\nsuggest that defenders of the principle have failed to provide a\nsufficient reason for thinking it is true. \n\n\nThe principle of sufficient reason can be illustrated in various\nways,\u2026but it cannot be proved\u2026. If one were to try\nproving it, he would sooner or later have to appeal to considerations\nthat are less plausible than the principle itself. Indeed, it is hard\nto see how one could even make an argument for it without already\nassuming it. For this reason it might properly be called a\npresupposition of reason itself. (Taylor 1992: 87) \n\n\n It might be denied that the request for a sufficient\nreason for the truth of principle itself invokes the PSR on the\ngrounds that \u201creason\u201d has two senses, explanation and\nevidence. However, in requesting and giving a sufficient reason for\nthe truth of the principle, the explanation of why it is true should\nprovide sufficient evidence to support the claim. (See the\nintroduction to the entry\n Principle of Sufficient Reason).\n\n\nFinally, critics have argued that an argument for the application of\nthe Causal Principle to the universe cannot be drawn from inductive\nexperience. Even if the Causal Principle applies to events in the\nworld, we cannot extrapolate from the way the world works to the world\nas a whole (Mackie 1982: 85). The type of causation we experience in\nthe empirical world is different from the kind of causation proposed\nto hold between a necessary being and the cosmos (Kant 1787:\nB638).\n\nWe will return to the Principle of Causation below with respect to the\nkal\u0101m argument.\n4.5 Objection 4: Problems with the Concept of a Necessary Being\n\nKant argued that the cosmological argument introduced an empirical\npremise to evade the difficulties of the ontological argument.\nAlthough in the ontological argument the perfect being is allegedly\ndetermined to exist through its own concept, in fact nothing can be\ndetermined to exist in this manner; one has to begin with existence\n(see entry on\n Ontological Arguments).\n The cosmological argument, on the other hand, proceeds from an\nempirical premise about my existence to the existence of an\nunconditioned, absolutely necessary being, a being whose nonexistence\nis \u201cimpossible\u201d, \u201cabsolutely inconceivable\u201d\n(1787: B621). This concept has the same status as geometrical\nconcepts, which though necessary do not establish the existence of\nanything corresponding to the concept. So, when we think of an\nabsolutely necessary being, are we thinking about anything at all?\nWhat this absolutely necessary being is, what properties it has, can\nbe determined not through experience but only through reason, that is,\nfrom a priori concepts alone. Since the only concept that suffices to\ndetermine its properties is that of a most real being, the concept of\nan absolutely necessary being presupposes that concept. However, that\nthe most real being necessarily exists is the burden of the\nontological argument. Hence, the CA depends on the ontological\nargument to determine the absolutely necessary being. But since the\nontological argument is defective for the above and other reasons, the\ncosmological argument that depends on or invokes it likewise must be\ndefective (1787: B634; for an alternative interpretation of\nKant\u2019s argument see Proops 2014).\n\nKant\u2019s contention that the necessity found in \u201cnecessary\nbeing\u201d is logical necessity was common up through the 1960s.\nJ.J.C. Smart wrote,\n\n\nAnd by \u201ca necessary being\u201d the cosmological argument means\n\u201ca logically necessary being\u201d, i.e., \u201ca\nbeing whose non-existence is inconceivable in the sort of way that a\ntriangle\u2019s having four sides is inconceivable\u201d.\u2026\nNow since \u201cnecessary\u201d is a word which applies primarily to\npropositions, we shall have to interpret \u201cGod is a necessary\nbeing\u201d as \u201cThe proposition \u2018God exists\u2019 is\nlogically necessary\u201d (1955: 38); in a later work, Smart (Smart\nand Haldane 1996: 41\u201347) broadened his notion of necessity.)\n\n\nMany recent discussions of the cosmological argument, both supporting\nand critiquing it, interpret the notion of a necessary being as a\nbeing that cannot not exist (O\u2019Connor 2008: 78, 2013: 38). For\nexample, Gale-Pruss contend that speaking about necessary beings does\nnot differ from speaking of the necessity of propositions (see\n section 6).\n As such, as Plantinga notes, if a necessary being is possible, it\nexists (God, Freedom and Evil, 1967: 110). It is a being that\nexists in all possible worlds. The only question that remains is\nwhether God\u2019s existence is possible. This notion is similar to,\nif not a modernization of, Aquinas\u2019s contention that God\u2019s\nessence is to exist. Aquinas attempts to avoid the accusation that\nthis invokes the ontological argument on the grounds that we do not\nhave an adequate concept of God\u2019s essence (ST\nI,q.2,a.1). However, if we understand \u201cnecessary being\u201d in\nthis sense, we can dispose of the cosmological argument as irrelevant;\nwhat is needed rather is an argument to establish that God\u2019s\nexistence understood as logically necessary is possible, for if it is\npossible that it is necessary that God exists, then necessarily God\nexists (by Axiom S5).\n\nHowever, this need not be the sense in which \u201cnecessary\nbeing\u201d is understood in the cosmological argument. A more\nadequate notion of necessary being is that the necessity is\nmetaphysical or factual (Hick 1960). A necessary being is one that if\nit exists, it neither came into existence nor can cease to exist, and\ncorrespondingly, if it does not exist, it cannot come into existence\n(Reichenbach 1972: 117\u201320). If it exists, it eternally maintains\nits own existence; it is self-sufficient and self-sustaining. So\nunderstood, the cosmological argument does not rely on notions central\nto the ontological argument. Rather, instead of being superfluous, the\ncosmological argument, if sound, gives us reason to think that the\nnecessary being exists rather than not.\n\nMackie replies that if God has mere metaphysical or factual necessity,\nGod\u2019s existence is logically contingent, such that some reason\nis required for God\u2019s own existence (Mackie 1982: 84). As\nSwinburne notes, God is a logically contingent being, and so could\nhave not-existed (2004: 79, 148). Why, then, does God exist? The PSR\ncan be applied to the necessary being.\n\nThe theist responds that the PSR does not address logical contingency\nbut metaphysical contingency. One is not required to find a reason for\nwhat is not metaphysically contingent. It is not that the necessary\nbeing is self-explanatory; rather, a demand for explaining its\nexistence is inappropriate. Hence, the theist concludes,\nHawking\u2019s question \u201cWho created God?\u201d (Hawking 1988:\n174) is out of place (Davis 1997). We will return to this discussion\nin\n section 9.\n5. Argument from a Strong Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nMichael Almeida (2018) builds on the critical arguments of van Inwagen\nand others regarding the PSR. He contends that the version of the PSR\nused by defenders of the cosmological argument is inadequate because\nit fails to provide the best explanation for the universe. The best\nexplanation, and hence the one required of a sound cosmological\nargument, is an absolute explanation, where everything is explained\ncompletely. There are no brute or contingent facts. He notes that in\nconstructing their respective cosmological arguments, Pruss and\nSwinburne reject absolute explanation for complete explanations, where\nthe effect is explained fully by the cause operating at a given time\nbut where no explanation of the cause at the time of the occurrence is\nrequired. According to him, traditional defenders of the cosmological\nargument cannot invoke the requirement of an absolute explanation\nbecause if they did, given their metaphysic of actualist realism, they\nwould incur a host of problems. Since all is determined on an absolute\nexplanation, they would face the problems of the impossibility of\nlibertarian free will, of indeterministic quantum effects, of modal\nimagination about lawless worlds where things pop into existence, and\nthe collapse of modal distinctions. These problems, he says, arise not\nfrom an absolutist PSR per se but from its conjunction with\nactualist realism (only the actual is real). \n\nThe way around this, he contends, if one is going to defend the\ncosmological argument, is to opt for a different ontology, namely,\ngenuine modal realism (mere possibilities are also real), which he\nclaims not only can legitimize the cosmological argument but avoids\nthe above problems. According to Almeida, modal realism makes\nlibertarian free will compatible with necessitarianism in that two\npossible worlds can have the same history H up to time\nt, but at t, A occurs in one world and not in\nanother world. The two histories do not determine whether A or\n-A occurs, but all possibilities necessarily occur. To make\nthis work Almeida fudges on the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Although the two series H and H* up to\nt are identical, there is not one series H that forks at\nt. Rather, there are two series, such that at t A\ncan occur in one series and -A can occur in another. The past\ndoes not necessitate the future. Similarly, lawless or chaotic worlds,\ni.e., worlds lacking relations following a causal principle, are\npossible, so that it is possible and hence necessary that causeless\nevents occur. In such a world the cosmological argument would still\nhold, he claims, because the principle of sufficient reason,\ncompatible with the falsity of the causal principle, still holds. This\nanalysis, he thinks, frees the defender of the cosmological argument\nfrom problems that trouble traditional formulations. \n\nWe cannot digress here into modal realism (for discussion of possible\nworlds, see entries on\n Possible Worlds\n and\n David Lewis:\n Modal Metaphysics), but turn specifically to Almeida\u2019s\ncosmological argument. He argues that whereas cosmological arguments\nin the past commenced with an initial premise that was taken to\nexpress a contingent fact known a posteriori, \u201cfacts\nabout change, causation, contingency, and objective\u2026becoming\nare not usefully characterized as a posteriori facts\u201d (2018: 3).\nHe advances a cosmological argument with what he takes is an a\npriori fact: the pluriverse and everything in it, including all\nactualia and all possibilia, exist necessarily. This, he claims, is\nknowable a priori and according to the PSR requires an absolute\nexplanation. Part of his novel approach is his contention that every\nproposition in the argument expresses a necessary fact known a\npriori, and that a priori propositions also require an\nexplanation.\n\nSince Almeida does not advance a detailed version of the cosmological\nargument, we might attempt to reconstruct his view. \n\n\u201cPossible worlds are composite concrete\nobjects\u2026 [that] necessarily coexist\u201d (2018: 75).\nThis is a central contention of his Lewisian modal realism (75). \n The pluriverse exists as \u201cthe collection of all possible\nworlds\u201d (7,75). \n Everything that exists has an absolute explanation for its\nexistence. Strong PSR \n \u201cTherefore, there is an absolute explanation for the\npluriverse\u201d (75).\n An absolute explanation is possible \u201conly if there are no\ncontingent facts,\u201d that is, only if everything exists\nnecessarily (78\u201379).\n Therefore, there are no brute or contingent facts.\n This absolute explanation is found in the fact that God\nnecessarily exists (75,82). \n\n\nThe pluriverse is the necessary, creative manifestation of the\nnecessarily existing God (5). \n\nAlthough from necessary propositions contingent propositions cannot\nfollow, necessary propositions can follow. That is, from God\u2019s\nnecessary existence we can conclude that the pluriverse necessarily\nexists. This avoids the van Inwagen objection to the PSR as employed\nin the cosmological argument. Almeida holds that it also avoids the\nother problems associated with the cosmological argument in that it\nallows for contingency within absolute explanation. He contends that\ncontingency is protected by lowering the standards of similarity\nbetween worlds; that is, contingency is possible where we do not\nrequire exact identity between things held to exist in different\nworlds. He gives the example of his speaking Finnish, something he\ncannot do in the actual world. If someone who is identical to Almeida\nexists in another world, metaphysically he must have identical\nproperties. However, it makes sense to say that in another possible\nworld Almeida could speak Finnish and still be Almeida. We lower the\nstandards of similarity in our everyday consideration of existence in\nalternate worlds to allow for such possibilities and hence for the\ncontingency of his not speaking Finnish in the actual world.\n\nSeveral objections might be raised against this version of the\ncosmological argument. Perhaps most basic is the question why one\nwould accept modal realism. It is, as Almeida and others note,\n\u201contologically extravagant\u201d. Second, whereas necessity\ncharacterizes the metaphysical world, for Almeida contingency appears\nto be a subjective, epistemic contribution. That is, metaphysically,\neverything necessarily is what it is, has all its properties\nessentially, and is not something else. Epistemically, we can lower\nthe standards of similarity, so that two things with somewhat\ndiffering essential properties can be named the same, although\nstrictly or metaphysically speaking, they are not the same. Similarity\nis an epistemically expansive concept to allow for contingency, but it\ndoes not allow for metaphysical contingency. Third, he contends that\nthere are no brute facts on his theory. However, if there must be an\nabsolute explanation for everything, what is the explanation for\nGod\u2019s existence? He gives God as an absolute explanation for the\nnecessary existence of the pluriverse, but no absolute sufficient\nreason for God\u2019s existence. He might reply that God\u2019s\nexistence is explained by being metaphysically necessary. However, if\nthis explains God\u2019s existence, since every component of the\npluriverse and the pluriverse itself necessarily exist, why could not\ntheir metaphysical necessity be a sufficient reason or absolute\nexplanation for their existence? Could they, like God, simply be\nnecessary? \n6. Argument from a Weak Principle of Sufficient Reason\n\nRichard Gale and Alexander Pruss (1999) advanced a modal version of\nthe cosmological argument. They reject the strong version of the PSR,\naccording to which \u201cfor every proposition \\(p\\), if \\(p\\) is\ntrue, then there is a proposition, \\(q\\), that explains \\(p\\)\u201d.\nIn its place they favor using a weak version of the PSR\u2014it is\npossible that for every true proposition, there is a proposition,\n\\(q\\), that explains \\(p\\)\u2014that they believe is less\nquestion-begging and more initially acceptable to critics. They phrase\nthe argument in terms of contingent and necessary propositions. A\ncontingent proposition is one that is both possibly true and possibly\nfalse (i.e., true in some worlds and false in others); a necessarily\ntrue proposition is true in every possible world. In its simplest\nform, the argument is (1) if it is possible that it is necessary that\na supernatural being of some sort exists, then it is necessary that a\nsupernatural being of that sort exists. Since (2) it is possible that\nit is necessary that a supernatural being of some sort exists, (3) it\nis necessary that this being exists. The being that Gale has in mind\nis a very powerful and intelligent designer-creator, not the perfect\nGod of Anselm, for this perfect God who would exist in all possible\nworlds would be incompatible with the existence of gratuitous and\nhorrendous evils to be found in some of those possible worlds.\n\nIf one grants modal Axiom S5 (if it is possible that it is necessary\nthat \\(p\\), then it is necessary that \\(p\\)), the critical premise in\nthe argument is the second, and Gale and Pruss proceed to defend it\nusing their weak PSR. They begin with the notion of a Big Conjunctive\nFact (BCF), which is the totality of propositions that would be true\nof any possible world were it actualized. Since all possible worlds\nwould have the same necessary propositions, they are differentiated by\ntheir Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact (BCCF), which would contain\ndifferent contingent propositions. Let \\(p\\) be the BCCF of the actual\nworld \\(W\\). Suppose, further, that it is possible that \\(p\\) has an\nexplanation, that is, that it is possible that some proposition \\(q\\)\nexplains \\(p\\). As such, there is a possible world \\(W_{1}\\) that\ncontains \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and the proposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\).\nThe question now is whether \\(W_{1}\\) is the actual world, that is,\nwhether there is a proposition \\(q\\) that explains \\(p\\) in the actual\nworld. Gale argues that \\(W_{1}\\) (which contains \\(q\\) and the\nproposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\)) is the actual world, for since\n\\(W_{1}\\) contains \\(p\\), there can be no property of \\(p\\) that is\nnot found in \\(W_{1}\\). Every conjunct of \\(p\\) will be a conjunct of\n\\(p_{1}\\) (the BCCF of \\(W_{1}\\)) in \\(W_{1}\\). Suppose that \\(r\\) is\na conjunct of \\(p\\) in \\(W\\), then not-\\(r\\) cannot be a conjunct of\n\\(p_{1}\\) in \\(W_{1}\\). Since \\(W\\) and \\(W_{1}\\) have the same\nproperties, \\(W_{1}\\) is the actual world. Therefore, since these\nworlds are identical, the actual world contains \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and the\nproposition that \\(q\\) explains \\(p\\). That is, there is something\nthat explains the BCCF of the actual world. The explanation of the\nBCCF cannot be scientific, for such would be in terms of law-like\npropositions and statements about the actual world at a given time,\nwhich would be contingent and hence part of the BCCF. Since the only\nexplanations we can conceive of are personal or scientific, \\(q\\)\nprovides a personal explanation of the BCCF in terms of the\nintentional action of a necessary being who freely brings it about\nthat the world exists. \\(q\\) cannot report the action of a contingent\nbeing, for then the being would be part of \\(p\\) and explained by\n\\(q\\). However, something cannot explain itself. Hence, although\ncontingent, \\(q\\) reports the action of a necessary being. Gale\nconcludes that although this necessary being exists in every possible\nworld, this tells little about its power, goodness, and other\nqualities. To make this being palatable to theists, he offers that the\nargument be supplemented by other arguments, such as the teleological\narguments, to suggest that the necessary being is the kind of being\nthat satisfies theistic requirements. Since \n\n\nthe actual world\u2019s universe displays a wondrous complexity due\nto its law-like unity and simplicity, fine tuning of natural\nconstants, and natural purpose and beauty,\u2026there exists a\nnecessary supernatural being who is very powerful, intelligent, and\ngood and freely creates the actual world\u2019s universe. (1999:\n468\u201369) \n\n\n(For the detailed 18 step deductive argument, see Gale and Pruss 1999:\n462\u201369).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised about the argument from the weak\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Almeida and Judisch (2002) construct\ntheir objection via two reductio arguments. They note that, according\nto Gale\u2019s argument, \\(q\\) is a contingent proposition in the\nactual world that reports the free, intentional action of a necessary\nbeing. As such, since the actual world contains the contingent\nproposition \\(q\\), non-\\(q\\) is possible. That is, there is a possible\nworld \\(W_{2}\\) that contains \\(p\\), non-\\(q\\), and the proposition\nthat \\(q\\) does not explain \\(p\\). However, by Gale\u2019s own\nreasoning, \\(W_{2}\\) is identical to the actual world. But the actual\nworld cannot contain both \\(q\\) and non-\\(q\\). Thus, \\(q\\) cannot be a\ncontingent proposition.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that \\(q\\) is a contingently necessary\nproposition, that is, that it is possible that \\(q\\) is necessary and\npossible that \\(q\\) is not necessary. By S5, we get that it is\nnecessary that \\(q\\) is necessary, making it impossible that \\(q\\) is\nnot necessary. As a result, it is both possible and not-possible that\n\\(q\\) is not necessary, which likewise shows that \\(q\\) cannot be a\ncontingently necessary proposition. The only other option is that\n\\(q\\) is a necessary truth, which would beg the question. Thus, the\nargument fails by being unable to characterize \\(q\\). For rebuttals,\nsee Gale and Pruss (2002) and Rutten (2012: 84\u201387, see Other\nInternet Resources).\n\nGraham Oppy (2000) similarly argues that suppose \\(p_1\\) is the BCF of\nsome possible world, and \\(p_1\\) has no explanation. Then, given \\(r\\)\n(namely, that \\(p_1\\) has no explanation) there is a conjunctive fact\n\\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\). Since by hypothesis the conjunctive fact \\(p_1\\)\nand \\(r\\) is true in some world, on Gale\u2019s account it is true in\nthe actual world. Then by the weak PSR there is a world in which this\nconjunction of \\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\) possibly has an explanation. If there\nis an explanation for the conjunction of \\(p_1\\) and \\(r\\), there is\nan explanation for \\(p_1\\). Thus, we have the contradiction that\n\\(p_1\\) both has and does not have an explanation, which is absurd.\nHence, no world exists where the BCF lacks an explanation, which is\nthe strong principle of sufficient reason that Gale allegedly\ncircumvented. Since accepting the weak PSR would commit the nontheist\nto the strong PSR and ultimately to a necessary being, the nontheist\nhas no motivation to accept the weak PSR.\n\nGale and Pruss (2002) subsequently concede that their weak PSR does\nentail the strong PSR, but they contend that there still is no reason\nnot to proceed with the weak PSR, which they think the nontheist would\naccept. The only grounds for rejecting it, they claim, is that it\nleads to a theistic conclusion, which is not an independent reason for\nrejecting it. Oppy, however, maintains that appealing to some initial\ninstincts of acceptance is irrelevant. Perhaps the nontheists did not\nsee what granting the weak PSR entailed, that it contradicted other\nthings they had independent reasons to believe, or they did not fully\nunderstand the principle. There is a modus tollens reason to\nreject it, since there are other grounds for thinking that theism is\nfalse.\n\nJerome Gellman has argued that the Gale/Pruss conclusion to a being\nthat is not necessarily omnipotent also fails; this being is\nessentially omnipotent and, if omnipotence entails omniscience, is\nessentially omniscient. This too Gale and Pruss concede, which means\nthat the necessary being they conclude to is not significantly\ndifferent from that arrived at by the traditional cosmological\nargument that appeals to the moderate version of the PSR (that\ncontingent beings need a sufficient reason or explanation for\ntheir existence). \n7. The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument\n\nA second type of cosmological argument, contending for a first or\nbeginning cause of the universe, has a venerable history, especially\nin the Islamic mutakalliman tradition. Although it had\nnumerous defenders through the centuries, it received new life in the\nrecent voluminous writings of William Lane Craig. Craig formulates the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument this way (Craig and Sinclair\n2009; Craig and Smith 1993: chap. 1).\n\nEverything that begins to exist has a cause of its\nexistence.\nThe universe began to exist.\nTherefore, the universe has a cause of its\nexistence.\nNo scientific explanation (in terms of physical laws\nand initial conditions of the universe) can provide a causal account\nof the origin (very beginning) of the universe, since such are part of\nthe universe.\nTherefore, the cause must be personal (explanation is\ngiven in terms of a non-natural, personal\n agent).[2]\n\n\nThe kal\u0101m argument has been the subject of much recent\ndebate, only some of which can be summarized here. (For greater\nbibliographic detail, see Craig and Sinclair 2009 and Copan and Craig,\neds. 2017 & 2019.)\n7.1 The Causal Principle and Quantum Physics\n\nThe basis for the argument\u2019s first premise is the Causal\nPrinciple that undergirds many cosmological arguments. (Oderberg\n[2002: 308] is mistaken when he tries to establish the uniqueness of\nthe kal\u0101m argument by denying that the Causal Principle\nplays a role in kal\u0101m argument. It only does not play a\nrole in supporting a particular premise in the argument.) Defenders\nand critics alike suggest that basing the argument on the Principle of\nCausation rather than on the more general Principle of Sufficient\nReason is advantageous to the argument (Morriston 2000: 149). Craig\nholds that the first premise is intuitively obvious; no one, he says,\nseriously denies it (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 57). Although at\ntimes Craig suggests that one might treat the principle as an\nempirical generalization based on our ordinary and scientific\nexperiences (which might not be strong enough for the argument to\nsucceed in a strong sense, although it might be supplemented by an\ninference to the best explanation argument that what best explains the\nsuccess of science is that reality operates according to the causal\nprinciple), ultimately, he argues, the truth of the Causal Principle\nrests \u201cupon the metaphysical intuition that something cannot\ncome out of nothing\u201d (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 147).\n\u201cNo one sincerely believes that things, say, a horse or\nan Eskimo village, can just pop into being without a cause\u201d\n(Craig and Sinclair 2009: 182), and this includes the universe.\n\nThe Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism. (We\naddressed objections to the Causal Principle as subsumed under the PSR\nfrom a philosophical perspective earlier in\n 4.4.)\n Some critics deny that they share Craig\u2019s intuitions about the\nCausal Principle (Oppy 2002). Morriston (2000) argues that, for one\nthing, it does not seem to be an a priori truth, for not only\ndoes it lack \u201ca kind of \u2018luminosity\u2019 that makes it\nimpossible not to believe it, but closer inspection does not make it\nclearer that it is true\u201d (2000: 156\u201359). He points not\nonly to the presence of serious doubters (which he thinks he should\nnot be able to find were it truly an a priori truth), but\nalso to quantum phenomena, and thereby joins those who raise\nobjections to the Causal Principle based on quantum physics (Davies\n1984: 200). On the quantum level, the connection between cause and\neffect, if not entirely broken, is to some extent loosened. For\nexample, it appears that electrons can pass out of existence at one\npoint and come back into existence elsewhere. One can neither trace\ntheir intermediate existence nor determine what causes them to come\ninto existence at one point rather than another. Neither can one\nprecisely determine or predict where they will reappear; their\nsubsequent location is only statistically probable given what we know\nabout their antecedent states. Hence, as Smith argues, \n\n\nquantum-mechanical considerations show that the causal proposition is\nlimited in its application, if applicable at all, and consequently\nthat a probabilistic argument for a cause of the Big Bang cannot go\nthrough. (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 121\u201323, 182)\n\n\nCraig responds that appeals to quantum phenomena do not affect the\nkal\u0101m argument. For one thing, quantum events are not\ncompletely devoid of causal conditions. Even if one grants that the\ncausal conditions are not jointly sufficient to determine the event,\nat least some necessary conditions are involved in the quantum event.\nHowever, when one considers the beginning of the universe, he notes,\nthere are no prior necessary causal conditions; simply nothing exists\n(Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 146; see Koons 1997: 203). Pruss\n(2006: 169) contends that in quantum phenomena causal indeterminacy is\ncompatible with the causal principle in that the causes\nindeterministically bring about the effect. Morriston is rightly\npuzzled by this reply, for, he asks, what \n\n\nmakes a cause out of a bunch of merely necessary\nconditions. Apparently not that they are jointly\nsufficient to produce the effect. (2000: 158) \n\n\nIf conditions are not jointly sufficient, is there reason to think\nthat premise 1 is true? More recently, Craig argues that \n\n\nnot all physicists agree that subatomic events are uncaused\u2026.\nIndeed, most of the available interpretations of the mathematical\nformulation of [Quantum Mechanics] are fully deterministic. (Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 183. Jean Bricmont 2017, chap. 5, argues that\nBohm\u2019s causally deterministic interpretation of quantum\nphenomena is superior to the nondeterministic interpretation.) \n\n\nFor another, Craig argues, a difference exists between predictability\nand causality. It is true that, given Heisenberg\u2019s principle of\nuncertainty, we cannot precisely predict individual subatomic events.\nWhat is debated is whether this inability to predict is due to the\nabsence of sufficient causal conditions, or whether it is merely a\nresult of the fact that any attempt to precisely measure these events\nalters their status. The very introduction of the observer into the\narena so affects what is observed that it gives the appearance that\neffects occur without sufficient or determining causes. However, we\nhave no way of knowing what is happening without introducing observers\ninto the situation and the changes they bring. In the above example,\nwe simply are unable to discern the intermediate states of the\nelectron\u2019s existence apart from introducing conditions of\nobservation. When Heisenberg\u2019s indeterminacy is understood \nas describing not simply the events themselves but these events\nrelative to our knowledge of the events, the Causal Principle still\nholds and can still be applied to the initial singularity, although we\ncannot expect to achieve any kind of determinate predictability about\nwhat occurs in specific cases on the sub-atomic level given the\ncause.\n\nAt the same time, it should be recognized that showing that\nindeterminacy is a real feature of the world at the quantum level\nwould have significant negative implications for the more general\nCausal Principle that underlies the deductive cosmological argument.\nThe more this indeterminacy has ontological significance, the weaker\nis the Causal Principle. This is particularly important for subatomic\nevents, which would characterize the beginning of the universe.\nHowever, if the indeterminacy has merely epistemic significance, it\nscarcely affects the Causal Principle. Quantum accounts allow for\nadditional speculation regarding origins and structures of universes.\nIn effect, whether Craig\u2019s response to the quantum objection\nsucceeds depends upon deeper issues, in particular, the epistemic and\nontological status of quantum indeterminacy, the nature of the Big\nBang as a quantum phenomenon, the nature and role of indeterminate\ncausation, and whether realist theories about quantum phenomena have\nserious traction. Quantum physics is murky, as evidenced by\nBell\u2019s gedanken experiments, as described by Mermin\n(1985).\n\nSupporting the Causal Principle, Andrew Loke (2017: chapter 5) offers\na Modus Tollens argument that he thinks is immune to the criticisms in\n4.4 and that responds to the suggestion that only the initial state of\nreality began to exist uncaused (Oppy 2015). Loke argues that (a) if\nx begins to exist without a causally antecedent condition, then\nother kinds of things that can begin to exist can do so without a\ncausally antecedent condition, because (b) there would be no causally\nantecedent condition that would make it the case that only x\n(rather than these other kinds of things) begins to exist, and (c) the\nproperties of x and the properties of other kinds of things\nthat differentiate between them would be had by them only when they\nhad already begun to exist. (b) and (c) jointly imply that there would\nbe no essential difference between x and other kinds of things\nwhere beginning to exist uncaused is concerned. However, (d) it is not\nthe case that other kinds of things that can begin to exist would also\nbegin to exist without a causally antecedent condition. Therefore, (e)\nit is not the case that x begins to exist without a causally\nantecedent condition. For the critic, the critical question concerns\nthe grounds on which (d) is true, since there is a significant\ndifference between quantum events and nonquantum events (see the\ndiscussion of Quantum Physics above).\n7.2 Impossibility of an Actual Infinite\n\nIn defense of premise 2, Craig develops both a priori and\na posteriori arguments. His primary a priori\nargument is\n\nAn actual infinite cannot exist.\nA beginningless temporal series of events is an actual\ninfinite.\nTherefore, a beginningless temporal series of events\ncannot exist.\n\n\nSince conclusion 8 follows validly, if premises 6 and 7 are true the\nargument is sound. In defense of premise 6, he defines an actual\ninfinite as a determinate totality that occurs when a part of a system\ncan be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the entire system\n(Craig and Sinclair 2009: 104). Craig argues that if actual infinites\nthat neither increase nor decrease in the number of members they\ncontain were to really exist, rather absurd consequences would result.\nFor example, imagine a library with an actually infinite number of\nbooks. Suppose that the library also contains an infinite number of\nred and an infinite number of black books, so that for every red book\nthere is a black book, and vice versa. It follows that the library\ncontains as many red books as the total books in its collection and as\nmany red books as red and black books combined. However, this is\nabsurd; in reality the subset cannot be equivalent to the entire set.\nLikewise, in a real library by removing a certain number of books we\nreduce the overall collection. However, if infinites are actual, a\nlibrary with an infinite number of books would not be reduced in size\nat all by removal of a specific number of books (short of all of them\nor all but a specific number), for example, all the red books or those\nwith even catalogue numbers (Craig and Smith 1993: 11\u201316). The\nabsurdities resulting from attempting to apply basic arithmetical\noperations, functional in the real world, to infinities suggest that\nalthough actual infinites can have an ideal existence, they cannot\nreally exist.\n\nCraig\u2019s point is this. Two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same\nsize just in case they can be put into one-to-one correspondence, that\nis, if and only if every member of \\(A\\) can be correlated with\nexactly one member of \\(B\\) in such a way that no member of \\(B\\) is\nleft out. In the case of infinite sets, this notion of \u201csame\nsize\u201d yields results like the following: the set of all natural\nnumbers (let this be \\(A\\)) is the same size as the set of squares of\nnatural numbers (\\(B\\)), since every member of \\(A\\) can be correlated\nwith exactly one member of \\(B\\) in a way that leaves out no member of\n\\(B\\) (correlate \\(0\\leftrightarrow 0\\), \\(1\\leftrightarrow1\\),\n\\(2\\leftrightarrow4\\), \\(3\\leftrightarrow9\\), \\(4\\leftrightarrow\n16\\),\u2026). This is a case\u2014recognized in fact as early as\nGalileo (Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences)\u2014where\ntwo infinite sets have the same size but, intuitively, one of them, as\na proper subset, appears to be smaller than the other.\n\nCraig uses a similar, intuitive notion of \u201csmaller than\u201d\nin his argument concerning the library. It appears that the set \\(B\\)\nof red books in the library is smaller than the set \\(A\\) of all the\nbooks in the library, even though both have the same (infinite) size.\nCraig concludes that it is absurd to suppose that such a library is\npossible in actuality, since the set of red books would\nsimultaneously have to be smaller than the set of all books and yet\nequal in size.\n\nCritics fail to be convinced by these paradoxes of infinity. For\nexample, Rundle (2004: 170) agrees with Craig that the concept of an\nactual infinite is paradoxical, but this, he argues, provides no\ngrounds for thinking it is incoherent. The logical problems with the\nactual infinite are not problems of incoherence but arise from the\nfeatures that are characteristic of infinite sets. When the intuitive\nnotion of \u201csmaller than\u201d is replaced by a precise\ndefinition, finite sets and infinite sets just behave somewhat\ndifferently, that is all. Cantor and all subsequent set theorists\ndefine a set \\(B\\) to be smaller than set \\(A\\) (i.e., has fewer\nmembers) just in case \\(B\\) is the same size as a subset of \\(A\\), but\n\\(A\\) is not the same size as any subset of \\(B\\). The application of\nthis definition to finite and infinite sets yields results that Craig\nfinds counter-intuitive but which mathematicians see as our best\nunderstanding for comparing the size of sets. They see the fact that\nan infinite set can be put into one-to-one correspondence with one of\nits own proper subsets as one of the defining characteristics\nof an infinite set, not an absurdity. Say that set \\(C\\) is a\nproper subset of \\(A\\) just in case every element of \\(C\\) is\nan element of \\(A\\) while \\(A\\) has some element that is not an\nelement of \\(C\\). In finite sets, but not necessarily in infinite\nsets, when set \\(B\\) is a proper subset of \\(A\\), \\(B\\) is smaller\nthan \\(A\\). However, this does not necessarily hold for infinite\nsets\u2014as above where \\(B\\) is the set of squares of natural\nnumbers and \\(A\\) is the set of all natural numbers. The proper subset\n\\(B\\) might be \u201csmaller\u201d than \\(A\\). What is crucial is\nthat \\(B\\) is not smaller in the sense of having a smaller number of\nmembers than \\(A\\) (i.e., a smaller cardinality).\n\nCantorian mathematicians argue that these results apply to any\ninfinite set, whether in pure mathematics, imaginary libraries, or the\nreal world series of concrete events. Thus, Smith argues that Craig\nbegs the question by wrongly presuming that an intuitive relationship\nholds between finite sets and their proper subsets, namely, that a set\nhas more members than its proper subsets must hold even in the case of\ninfinite sets (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 85). So while Craig\nthinks that Cantor\u2019s set theoretic definitions yield absurdities\nwhen applied to the world of concrete objects, which entails that\ninfinites cannot be actual, set theorists see no problem so long as\nthe proper definitions are maintained. Further discussion is in Oppy\n2006: 137\u201354.\n\nLoke (2017: 55\u201361; see Craig and Sinclair, 2009: 105\u20136)\nreplies to the above objections by arguing that what is mathematically\npossible is not always metaphysically possible. For example, the\nquadratic equation \\(x^2=4\\) can have two mathematically consistent\nresults for \\(x\\): 2 or \u22122, but if the question is \u201chow\nmany people carried the box home\u201d, the answer cannot be\n\u22122, for in the concrete world it is metaphysically impossible\nthat \u22122 people carry a box home. Thus, the conclusion of 2\npeople rather than \u22122 people derives not from mathematical\nequations alone but also from metaphysical considerations. Loke\nproceeds to argue that concrete infinities violate metaphysically\nnecessary truths concerning causal powers. \n\nCraig is well aware of the fact that he is using actual and potential\ninfinite in a way that differs from the traditional usage in Aristotle\nand Aquinas [Craig and Sinclair 2009: 115. For Aristotle, all the\nelements in an actual infinite exist simultaneously, whereas a\npotential infinite is realized over time by addition or division.\nHence, the temporal series of events, as formed by successively adding\nnew events, was a potential, not an actual, infinite (Aristotle,\nPhysics, III, 6)]. For Craig, however, an actual infinite is\na timeless totality that cannot be added to or reduced. \u201cSince\npast events, as determinate parts of reality, are definite and\ndistinct and can be numbered, they can be conceptually collected into\na totality\u201d (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 25). The future,\nbut not the past, is a potential infinite, for its events have not yet\nhappened.\n\nTurning to\n premise 7,\n why should one think that it is true that a beginningless series,\nsuch as the universe up to this point, is an actual rather than a\npotential infinite? For Craig, an actual infinite is a determinate\ntotality or a completed unity, whereas the potential infinite is not.\nSince the past events of a beginningless series can be conceptually\ncollected together and numbered, the series is a determinate totality\n(1979: 96\u201397). And since the past is beginningless, it has no\nstarting point and is infinite. If the universe had a starting point,\nso that events were added to or subtracted from this point, we would\nhave a potential infinite that increased through time by adding new\nmembers. The fact that the events do not occur simultaneously is\nirrelevant.\n\nBede Rundle rejects an actual infinite. His grounds for doing so (the\nsymmetry of the past and the future), if sustained, make\n  premise 7\n false. He argues that the reasons often advanced for asymmetry, such\nas those given by Craig, are faulty. It is true that the past is not\nactual, but neither is the future. Likewise, that the past, having\noccurred, is unalterable is irrelevant, for neither is the future\nalterable. The only time that is real is the present. \n\nFor Rundle, the past and the future are symmetrical; it is only our\nknowledge of them that is asymmetrical. Any future event lies at a\nfinite temporal distance from the present. Similarly, any past event\nlies at a finite temporal distance from the present. For each past or\nfuture event, beginning from the present, there can always be either a\nprior past event or a subsequent future event. Hence, for both series\nan infinity of events is possible, and, as symmetrical, the infinity\nof both series is the same. Since the series of future events is not\nan actual but a potential infinite (or, better, an \u201cindefinitely\nextendible\u201d series, 2004: 168; Craig and Sinclair 2012,\n104\u20135), the series of past events is also indefinitely\nextendible. It follows that although the future is actually finite, it\ndoes not require an end to the universe, for there is always a\npossible subsequent event (2004: 180). Similarly, although any given\npast event of the universe is finitely distant in time from now, a\nbeginning or initial event can be ruled out; for any given event there\nis a possible earlier event. However, since there is a possible prior\nor possible posterior event in any past or future series respectively,\nthe universe, although finite in time, is temporally unbounded\n(indefinitely extendible); both beginning and cessation are ruled out.\n[How Rundle (2004: 176\u201378) gets from the possibility of a\nsubsequent event to actually ruling out cessation and beginning is\nunclear.] Since there is no time when the material universe did not\nexist, it is not contingent but necessary. Hence, although the\nprinciple of sufficient reason is still true, it applies only to the\ncomponents of the material universe and not to the universe itself. No\nexplanation of the universe is possible. The universe, as\nmatter-energy, is neither caused nor destructible, not in the sense\nthat it could have been caused or could cease, but in the sense that\n\u201cthe notions of beginning and ceasing to exist are inapplicable\nto the universe\u201d (2004: 178).\n\nHowever, one might wonder, are the past series and future series of\nevents really symmetrical? It is true that one can start from the\npresent and count either forward or backward in time. Rundle thinks\nthat \u2026\\(x_5\\), \\(x_4\\), \\(x_3\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_1\\), \\(t_0\\),\n\\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(y_3\\), \\(y_4\\), \\(y_5\\) are all on the same\ncontinuum, so that we cannot distinguish ontologically the time\ndimension of the future and past series. The two series, going into\nthe past and into the future, would be the same in that however far we\ncount from the present \\(t_0\\) remains finite although indefinitely\nextendible. However, is it true that, as he claims, with regard to the\npast, \u201cany movement currently terminating can be redescribed as\nextending back\u201d, that counting backward from the present is the\nsame as counting from the past to the present (2004: 176)?\n\nCraig says no, for in the actual world we do not start from now to\narrive at the past; we move from the past to the present. To count\nbackwards, we would start from a particular point in time, the\npresent. From where would we start to count forward were the past\nindefinitely extendible? Both to count and to move from the past to\nthe present, we cannot start from the indefinitely extendible. Indeed,\nif the past is indefinitely extendible, no matter where we started, we\nwould have arrived at \\(t_0\\) long before now. \n\nOne cannot just reverse the temporal sequence of the past, for we do\nnot ontologically engage the sequence from the present to the past.\nRundle\u2019s two movements are quite disparate, such that the two\nsequences\u2014of the past and of the future\u2014are not\nsymmetrical, which leaves intact Craig\u2019s claim that a\nbeginningless past would result in an actual and not a potential\ninfinite.\n\nMorriston (2010) constructs an argument to show that, contrary to\nCraig, there is no relevant difference between a beginningless past\nand a determinate, endless future, such that if one is impossible\nbecause of absurdities so is the other, and if one is possible so is\nthe other. He creates a fictional scenario where God commands angels\nGabriel and Uriel to praise God alternatively for an eternity. \n\n\nIf you ask, \u201cHow many distinct praises will be said?\u201d, the\nonly sensible answer is, \u201cinfinitely many.\u2026 Each of\ninfinitely many distinct praises will be said, precisely because there\nwill be no future time at which all have been said \u201d. (Morriston\n2010: 443\u201344)\n\n\nHowever, an actually infinite number of future events is not\nimpossible; it can be envisioned and determined by God. \n\nMorriston proceeds to note that puzzles or absurdities parallel to\nthose Craig finds in the concept of an actual infinite of past events\nalso occur in the infinite series of future events. Suppose that \n\n\nGod could instead have determined that Gabriel and Uriel will stop\nafter praise number four. Infinitely many praises would be prevented,\nand the number of their future praises would be only four.\nAlternatively, God could have determined that Gabriel be silent during\nall the celestial minutes between Uriel\u2019s future praises. In\nthis case too, infinitely many praises would be prevented, but the\nnumber of future praises would instead be infinite. (Morriston 2010:\n444) \n\n\nAlthough this shows that an infinite future can have inconsistent\nimplications, God could still bring it about that these angels utter\ndistinct praises, one after another, ad infinitum. But then, Morriston\nconcludes, since these inconsistent implications do not count against\nan actual infinity of future events, the puzzles Craig poses do not\ncount against the possibility of an actual infinity of past events,\ni.e., a beginningless universe. If an infinite future is possible, as\nCraig concedes, so is an infinite past. \n\nMorriston contends that Craig\u2019s reply that in the one case the\nevents have occurred and in the other they have not, and hence that\nthe number of future praises is indefinite, is a distinction without a\ndifference. God can determine that an infinite number of praises will\nbe sung. \n\n\nThe non-existence of past events does not prevent us from asking how\nmany have occurred. Nor should the non-existence of future events\nprevent us from asking how many will occur. In neither case will\n\u201cindefinitely many\u201d do as an answer. (2010: 449) \n\n\nCraig\u2019s defense is that Morriston has ignored the difference\nbetween a potential and an actual infinite. According to Craig, an\nactual infinite is a collection of definite and discrete members whose\nnumber is greater than any natural number, whereas a potential\ninfinite is a collection that is increasing toward but never arriving\nat infinity as a limit (Craig 2010; Craig and Sinclair 2009: 116).\n\n\nMorriston objects to Craig\u2019s definition of the potential\ninfinite. For one thing, there is no limit to which the future praises\ngrow. The collection of praises continues to grow as the praises are\nsung, but it does not approach a limit, for always one more praise can\nbe sung. The series of future praises is actually infinite. \n\nCraig responds that Morriston is really attacking his notion of a\npotential infinite by claiming that no relevant distinction exists\nbetween a potential and an actual infinite. But this, he says, rests\non confusing an A-theory with a B-theory of time. An infinite directed\ntoward the future would be actual only on a B-theory of time, but not\non an A-theory (Craig 2010: 452\u201353). On an A-theory of time, a\nchange of tense makes a difference. That something actually has\nhappened differs significantly from what may (even if determined)\nhappen. \n\nCohen (2015: 177) continues Morriston\u2019s argument, insisting that\nCraig invokes an unmotivated principle that Cohen terms the \u201cThe\nActuality-Infinity Principle: In order for x to be actually\ninfinite in quantity, x must be actual\u201d. Cohen argues\nthat this begs the question. However, Craig\u2019s principle is\ndifferent: In order for x to be actually infinite in quantity,\nx must be or have been actual or actualized (Craig 2010:\n455\u201356). Cohen might respond, \u201cWhy not then say that for\nx to be actually infinite in quality x must be, have\nbeen, or will be actual or actualized?\u201d Cohen argues that\nCraig\u2019s presentism does not assist him here, since neither the\npast nor the future events are present and hence do not exist. Craig\nthinks otherwise (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 126), tacitly defending the\nprinciple in that temporal becoming sees to it that what has not\noccurred or is not occurring but as future is merely potential, even\nif determined or foreseen by God. \n7.3 Successive Addition Cannot Form an Actual Infinite\n\nCraig\u2019s second argument addresses this very point.\n\nThe temporal series of events is a collection formed\nby successive addition.\nA collection formed by successive synthesis is not an\nactual infinite.\nTherefore, the temporal series of events cannot be an\nactual infinite (Craig 1979: 103; Craig and Sinclair 2009, 117).\n\n\nThe collection of historical events is formed by successively adding\nevents, one following another. The events are not temporally\nsimultaneous but occur over a period of time as the series continues\nto acquire new members. Even if an actual infinite were possible, it\ncould not be realized by successive addition; in adding to the series,\nno matter how much adding is done, even to infinity, the series\nremains finite and only potentially infinite. One can neither count to\nnor traverse the infinite (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 118).\n\nIt might be objected that this sounds very much like Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes that prohibit Achilles or anyone from either beginning to\ncross an area or succeeding in doing so. However, notes Craig,\nsignificant disanalogies disallow this conclusion. For one,\nZeno\u2019s argument rests on progressively-narrowing, unequal\ndistances that sum to a finite distance, whereas in traversing the\npast the equal distances continue to the infinity of the future.\nSecond, Zeno\u2019s distances are potential because of divisibility,\nwhereas the distances from the past are actual distances or times to\nbe traversed.\n\nMorriston argues that premise 10 presupposes what is to be shown,\nnamely, that there is a beginning point. He asks, \n\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t there have been an infinite series of years in\nwhich there was no first year? It\u2019s true that in such a series\nwe never \u201carrive\u201d at infinity, but surely that is only\nbecause infinity is, so to speak, \u201calways already there\u201d.\nAt every point in such a series, infinitely many years have\nalready passed by.... Each event in a beginningless series\nterminating in the present could have been \u201cadded\u201d to the\ninfinitely many prior events. (2003: 290) \n\n\nThus, we don\u2019t need a starting point to form an actual infinite\nby successive addition. Infinity is already present in the series.\n Craig responds that we cannot just add \u201carriving at the\npresent\u201d to an already existing infinite.\n\n\n\nBefore the present event could occur, the event immediately before it\nwould have to occur; and before that event could occur, the event\nimmediately before it would have to occur; and so on ad\ninfinitum. One gets driven back into the past, making it\nimpossible for any event to occur. Thus, if the series of events were\nbeginningless, the present could not have occurred, which is absurd.\n(Craig and Sinclair 209: 118) \n\n\nIn other words, Why this moment rather than another? \n\nMorriston replies that that is just the way it is; \u201cthe past\njust is the series of events that have already\nhappened\u201d. To require a reason for the series of past events\narriving at now is to appeal to the principle of sufficient reason,\nwhich he deems both suspect and inappropriate for Craig to invoke\n(Morriston 2003: 293). \n\nTo defend his position, Craig presents Bertrand Russell\u2019s\nexample of Tristram Shandy, who writes his autobiography. It takes him\na year to write about one day of his life, so that as his life\nprogresses so does his autobiography in which he gets progressively\nfarther behind. Russell concludes that \n\n\nif (Shandy) had lived forever, and had not wearied of his task, then,\neven if his life had continued as eventfully as it began, no part of\nhis biography would have remained unwritten. ([1903] 1937: 358) \n\n\nHowever, Oderberg (2002: 310) claims, Russell seems to have\nfallaciously moved from (1) For every day, there is a year such that,\nby the end of that year, Shandy has recorded that day, which is true,\nto (2) There is a year such that, for every day, by the end of that\nyear Shandy has recorded that day. (2) is needed for Russell\u2019s\nconclusion but fails to follow from (1). Shandy\u2019s writing never\ncatches up with his life; indeed, the longer he lives, even if for\ninfinity, his writing would never catch up to his life but\nprogressively would get farther behind. Indeed, if he has been living\nand writing from infinity, his autobiography is infinitely behind his\nlife. Contrary to Russell, there will be days\u2014an infinite\nnumber\u2014about which he will be unable to write. As can be\nimagined, this example has been greatly contested, modified, and has\ngenerated a literature of its own. For samples, see Eells (1988),\nOderberg (2002), and Oppy (2003). Waters (2013) reformulates the\nparadox, attempting to avoid problems with earlier formulations.\n\nFinally, it is objected that Craig\u2019s argument presupposes an\n\\(A\\) view of time, where time flows from past to present to future\nand not all events tenselessly coexist. It seems that Craig\u2019s\nargument cannot be sustained if time is understood in the \\(B\\) sense,\nwhere all members of the series tenselessly coexist, being equally\nreal (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1994). On a \\(B\\) view of time there is no\nbeginning, and it would seem that on this view the argument would\ncollapse.\n7.4 The Big Bang Theory of Cosmic Origins\n\nOne of Craig and Sinclair\u2019s a posteriori arguments for\n premise 2\n invokes the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins. Since the universe is\nexpanding as the galaxies recede from each other, if we reverse the\ndirection of our view and look back in time, the farther we look, the\ndenser the universe becomes. If we push backwards far enough, we find\nthat the universe reaches a state of compression where the density and\ngravitational force are infinite. This unique singularity constitutes\nthe beginning of the universe\u2014of matter, energy, space, time,\nand all physical laws. It is not that the universe arose out of some\nprior state, for there was no prior state. Since time too comes to be,\none cannot ask what happened before the initial event. Neither should\none think that the universe expanded from some state of infinite\ndensity into space; space too came to be in that event. Since\nthe Big Bang initiates the very laws of physics, one cannot expect any\nscientific or physical explanation of this singularity.\n\nOne picture, then, is of the universe beginning in a singular,\nnon-temporal event roughly 13\u201314 billion years ago. Something,\nperhaps a quantum vacuum, came into existence. Its tremendous energy\ncaused it, in the first fractions of a second, to expand or inflate\nand explode, creating the four-dimensional space-time universe that we\nexperience today. How this all happened in the first \\(10^{-35}\\)\nseconds and subsequently is a matter of serious speculation and\ndebate. What advocates of\n premise 2\n maintain is that since the universe and all its material elements\noriginate in the Big Bang, the universe is temporally finite and thus\nhad a beginning. (For a detailed consideration of cosmogenic theories\nfrom the kal\u0101m perspective, see Craig and Sinclair 2009:\n125\u2013182; for the counter discussion see Gr\u00fcnbaum 1991). By\nitself, of course, this reasoning, even if accurate, leaves it the\ncase that\n premise 2\n and hence\n conclusion 3\n are only probably true, dependent on accepted cosmogenic\ntheories.\n\nSeveral replies to this argument can be made. First, questions have\nbeen raised about the adequacy of the theory of inflation to explain\nthe expansion of the universe. One problem is predictability, for on\nthis view anything that can happen will happen, an infinite number of\ntimes (Steinhardt 2011: 42). Further, the argument presupposes that\nthe General Theory of Relativity applies to the beginning of the\nuniverse, but some doubt that this is so, given that it cannot\nadequately account for the quantum gravity involved. \n\nSecond, some have suggested that since we cannot \u201cexclude the\npossibility of a prior phase of existence\u201d (Silk 2001: 63), it\nis possible that the universe has cycled through oscillations, perhaps\ninfinitely, so that Big Bangs occurred not once but an infinite number\nof times in the past and will do so in the future. The current\nuniverse is a \u201creboot\u201d of previous universes that have\nexpanded and then contracted (Musser 2004).\n\nThe traditional idea of an oscillating universe faced significant\nproblems. For one, no set of physical laws accounts for a series of\ncyclical universe-collapses and re-explosions. That the universe once\nexploded into existence provides no evidence that the event could\nreoccur even once, let alone an infinite number of times, should the\nuniverse collapse. Second, even an oscillating universe seems to be\nfinite (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 113). Further, the cycle of\ncollapses and expansions would not, as was pictured, be periodic (of\neven duration). Rather, entropy would rise from cycle to cycle, so\nthat even were a series of universe-oscillations possible, they would\nbecome progressively longer (Davies 1992: 52; Tolman 1934). If the\nuniverse were without beginning, by now that cycle would be infinite\nin duration, without any hope of contraction. Fourth, although each\nrecollapse would destroy the components of the universe, the radiation\nwould remain, so that each successive cycle would add to the total.\n\n\nResponding to these issues, recently proposed cosmologies based on\nstring theory have given new life to a cyclic view. For example, Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok have proposed a cyclic cosmological model\nwhere the universe repeatedly transitions from a big bang to a big\ncrunch to a big bang, and so on. They contend that \n\n\nthe Universe is flat, rather than closed. The transition from\nexpansion to contraction is caused by introducing negative potential\nenergy, rather than spatial curvature. Furthermore, the cyclic\nbehavior depends in an essential way on having a period of accelerated\nexpansion after the radiation and matter-dominated phases.\nDuring the accelerated expansion phase, the Universe approaches a\nnearly vacuous state, restoring very nearly identical local conditions\nas existed in the previous cycle prior to the contraction phase.\n(Steinhardt and Turok 2002: 2) \n\n\nDark energy becomes a key player in all of this. On the\nkal\u0101m view, the amount of dark energy in the universe\nmakes a return to its original state impossible. The universe is not\ncyclical but will die a cold death. On a cyclic view, dark energy\naccelerates the expansion of the universe needed \u201cto dilute the\nentropy, black holes and other debris produced in the previous cycle\nso that the universe is returned to its original pristine vacuum state\nbefore it begins to contract, bounce, and begin a cycle anew\u201d\n(Steinhardt and Turok 2001: 1436). \n\nThis specific cyclic theory has been challenged, and other cyclic\ncosmological theories have been proposed. What this shows is that any\nattempt to support the second premise of the kal\u0101m\nargument by accepting or refuting scientific cosmologies will\nencounter an ever-changing scene, given the speculative nature of\ncosmology. Thus, while Craig and Sinclair (2009: 150\u201374)\ncritically evaluate current contenders as not being viable, changes in\nand development of these theories and the inevitable development of\nothers make for unending point-counterpoint. \n7.5 The Big Bang Is Not an Event\n\nOne critical response to the kal\u0101m argument from the Big Bang is\nthat, given the Grand Theory of Relativity, the Big Bang is not an\nevent at all. An event takes place within a space-time context.\nHowever, the Big Bang has no space-time context; there is neither time\nprior to the Big Bang nor a space in which the Big Bang occurs. Hence,\nthe Big Bang cannot be considered as a physical event occurring at a\nmoment of time. As Hawking notes, the finite universe has no\nspace-time boundaries and hence lacks singularity and a beginning\n(Hawking 1988: 116, 136). Time might be multi-dimensional or\nimaginary, in which case one asymptotically approaches a beginning\nsingularity but never reaches it. And without a beginning the universe\nrequires no cause. The best one can say is that the universe is finite\nwith respect to the past, not that it was an event with a beginning.\n(Rundle 2004: chap. 8.)\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum defends this position by arguing that events can only\nresult from other events. \n\n\nSince the Big Bang singularity is technically a non-event, and \\(t=0\\)\nis not a bona fide time of its occurrence, the singularity cannot be\nthe effect of any cause in the case of either event-causation or agent\ncausation alike\u2026. The singularity \\(t=0\\) cannot have a cause.\n(Gr\u00fcnbaum 1994; Rundle 2004: 168, writes, \u201c[T]here is no\nevent\u2014the beginning of the universe\u2014to be explained,\nevents being possible only in time\u201d)\n\n\nOne response to Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s objection is to opt for broader\nnotions of \u201cevent\u201d and \u201ccause\u201d. We might\nbroaden the notion of \u201cevent\u201d by removing the requirement\nthat it must be relational, taking place in a space-time context. In\nthe Big Bang the space-time universe commences and then continues to\nexist in measurable time subsequent to the initiating singularity\n(Silk 2001: 456). Thus, one might consider the Big Bang as either the\nevent of the commencing of the universe or else a state in which\n\u201cany two points in the observable universe were arbitrarily\nclose together\u201d (Silk 2001: 63). As such, one might inquire why\nthis initial state of the universe existed in the finite past.\nLikewise, one need not require that causation embody the Humean\ncondition of temporal priority, but may treat causation\ncounter-factually, or perhaps even, as traditionally, a relation of\nproduction. Any causal statement about the universe would have to be\nexpressed atemporally, but for the theist this presents no problem\nprovided that God is conceived atemporally (at least prior to\ncreation) and sense can be made of atemporal causation.\n\nFurthermore, suppose Gr\u00fcnbaum is correct that the Big Bang\nsingularity is not an event. Then, by his reasoning that events only\narise from other events, subsequent so-called events cannot be the\neffect of that singularity. If they were, they would not be events\neither. \n\nGiven this understanding of space/time, we might reconceive the\nkal\u0101m argument.\n\nIf something has a finite past, its existence has a\ncause.\nThe universe has a finite past.\nTherefore, the universe has a cause of its\nexistence.\nThe universe includes space-time.\nTherefore, the cause of the universe transcends\nspace-time (in the sense that it existed aspatially and, when there\nwas no universe, atemporally). \nIf the cause of the universe\u2019s existence\ntranscends space-time, no scientific explanation can provide a causal\naccount of the origin of the universe.\nIf no scientific explanation can provide a causal\naccount of the origin of the universe, the cause must be personal\n(explanation is given in terms of a personal agent).\nTherefore, a personal cause of the universe exists.\n\n\n\nSome critics see a problem with this reformulation of the\nkal\u0101m argument in\n premise 12.\n Whereas behind\n premise 1\n of the original argument lies the ancient Parmenidean contention that\nout of nothing nothing comes, it is alleged that no principle directly\nconnects finitude with causation. They contend that we have no reason\nto think that just because something is finite it must have a cause of\nits coming into existence. Theists respond that this objection has\nmerit only if the critic denies that the Principle of Causation is\ntrue or that it applies to events like the Big Bang.\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1991) also argues that defenders of the\nkal\u0101m argument cannot make sense of the claim that the\nuniverse began to exist. \n\n\nThe question of its beginning is not, \u201cIf the universe did have\na bounded past of finite duration, what was the cause of its initial\nevent \\(t=0\\)?\u201d There simply did not exist any instants of\ntime before \\(t=0\\)! \n\n\nOne simply cannot ask what happened before \\(t=0\\); the question makes\nno sense. And if we cannot ask that question, then we cannot inquire\nwhether the Big Bang was an effect, for nothing temporal preceded it.\nQuestions about creation occur in time in the universe, not outside of\nit (Hawking 1987: 650\u201351).\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s contention is that to begin to exist requires a\nprevious time, and that there was no time prior to the Big Bang.\n\n\n[T]here is no first instant of time at all, just as there is\nno leftmost point on an infinite Euclidean line that extends in both\ndirections. Since here as elsewhere, the term \u2018always\u2019\nrefers to all actual past instants of time, the non-existence of time\nbefore \\(t=0\\) \u2026 allows that matter has always\nexisted, despite the finitude of the age of the universe in both sets\nof models. (1991)\n\n\nHowever, as Craig observes, the series is finite, not infinite, even\nthough it includes all past instants of time. Beginning to exist does\nnot entail that one has a beginning point in time. Craig\ndefines \u201c\\(x\\) begins to exist\u201d as \u201c\\(x\\) exists at\n\\(t\\) and there is no time immediately prior to \\(t\\) at which \\(x\\)\nexists\u201d (1992: 238). \n\n\nSomething has a beginning just in case the time during which it has\nexisted is finite.\u2026 So understood, deleting the beginning point\nof a thing\u2019s existence does not imply that the thing no longer\nbegins to exist and therefore came into being uncaused. (Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 185)\n\n\nMorriston (2000) suggests that this analysis of the universe\u2019s\ncoming to be no longer adequately supports\n premise 1,\n for we have no reason to think that something could not just come\ninto existence. Any appeal to ex nihilo nihil fit is either\ntautologous with the first premise or else appears mistakenly to treat\nnihilo as if it were \u201ca condition of something\u201d.\nIn part, what Morriston rejects is the intuitiveness that Craig sees\nin the truth of\n premise 1,\n where \u201cbeginning to exist\u201d is understood as explicated as\nabove (see our discussion in\n 7.1).\n It is not that premise 1 is false; it is just that it is unsupported\nand hence loses its plausibility. It has the same plausibility (or\nimplausibility) as creation ex nihilo. Morriston thinks that\n premise 1\n fares equally poorly if Craig attempts to justify it empirically, for\nwe have many situations where the causes of events have not been\ndiscovered, and even if we could find the causes in each individual\ncase, it provides no evidence that causation applies to the totality\nof cases (the universe). (See our discussion of this argument in\n 4.2\n and\n 4.3\n above.) Indeed, he argues, the inductive generalization involved in\ndefending the causal principle stands at odds with similar inductive\ngeneralizations that conflict with the kal\u0101m\nargument\u2014that something can be made without there being a prior\nstuff or that causes can bear no temporal relation to their effects.\n\n7.6 Personal Explanation\n\nFinally, something needs to be said about\n premise 3\n and\n conclusion 5,\n which asserts that the cause of the universe is personal. Defenders\nof the cosmological argument suggest two possible kinds of\n explanation.[3]\nNatural explanation is provided in terms of precedent\nevents, causal laws, or necessary conditions that invoke natural\nexistents. Personal explanation is given \u201cin terms of\nthe intentional action of a rational agent\u201d (Swinburne 2004: 21;\nalso Gale and Pruss 1999). We have seen that one cannot provide a\nnatural causal explanation for the initial event, for there are no\nprecedent natural events or natural existents to which the laws of\nphysics apply. The line of scientific explanation runs out at the\ninitial singularity, and perhaps even before we arrive at the initial\nsingularity (at \\(10^{-35}\\) seconds). If no scientific explanation\n(in terms of physical laws) can provide a causal account of the origin\nof the universe (premise 4), the explanation must be personal, that\nis, in terms of the intentional action of an intelligent, supernatural\nagent.\n\nMorriston (2000: 163\u201368) questions whether Craig\u2019s\nargument for the cause being personal goes through. Craig argues that\nif the cause were an eternal, nonpersonal, operating set of\nconditions, then the universe would exist from eternity. Below\nfreezing temperatures will always freeze whatever water is present.\nSince the universe has not existed from eternity, the cause must be a\npersonal agent who chooses freely to create an effect in time.\nHowever, notes Morriston, if the personal cause intended from eternity\nto create the world, and if the intention alone to create is causally\nsufficient to bring about the effect, then the universe would also\nexist from eternity, and there would be no reason to prefer a personal\ncause of the universe over a nonpersonal cause. For a timeless eternal\nbeing before creation, which is Craig\u2019s view, \u201cThere can\nbe no temporal gap between the time at which it does the willing and\nthe time at which the thing willed actually happens\u201d (2000,\n167). So the distinction in this respect between a personal and a\nnonpersonal eternal cause disappears. Craig (2002) replies that it is\nnot intention alone that must be present, but the personal agent must\nalso employ or exercise its personal causal power to bring about the\nworld. However, Morriston retorts, exercising personal causal power is\nan action in time, a view that is unavailable to Craig, for there is\nno time when God would restrain his causal powers. \n\nPaul Davies argues that one need not appeal to God to account for the\nBig Bang. Its cause, he suggests, is found within the cosmic system\nitself. Originally a vacuum lacking space-time dimensions, the\nuniverse \u201cfound itself in an excited vacuum state\u201d, a\n\u201cferment of quantum activity, teeming with virtual particles and\nfull of complex interactions\u201d (Davies 1984: 191\u201392),\nwhich, subject to a cosmic repulsive force, resulted in an immense\nincrease in energy. Subsequent explosions from this collapsing vacuum\nreleased the energy in this vacuum, reinvigorating the cosmic\ninflation and setting the scenario for the subsequent expansion of the\nuniverse. However, what is the origin of this increase in energy that\neventually made the Big Bang possible? Davies\u2019s response is that\nthe law of conservation of energy (that the total quantity of energy\nin the universe remains fixed despite transfer from one form to\nanother), which now applies to our universe, did not apply to the\ninitial expansion. Cosmic repulsion in the vacuum caused the energy to\nincrease from zero to an enormous amount. This great explosion\nreleased energy, from which all matter emerged. Consequently, he\ncontends, since the conclusion of the kal\u0101m argument is\nfalse, one of the premises of the argument\u2014in all likelihood the\nfirst\u2014is false.\n\nCraig responds that if the vacuum has energy, the question arises\nconcerning the origin of the vacuum and its energy. Merely pushing the\nquestion of the beginning of the universe back to some primordial\nquantum vacuum does not escape the question of what brought this\nvacuum laden with energy into existence. A quantum vacuum is not\nnothing (as in Newtonian physics) but \n\n\na sea of continually forming and dissolving particles that borrow\nenergy from the vacuum for their brief existence. A quantum vacuum is\nthus far from nothing, and vacuum fluctuations do not constitute an\nexception to the principle that whatever beings to exist has a cause.\n(Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 143\u201344)\n\n\nHence, he concludes, the appeal to a vacuum as the initial state is\nmisleading.\n\nOne might wonder, as Rundle (2004: 75\u201377) does, how a\nsupernatural agent could bring about the universe. He contends that a\npersonal agent (God) cannot be the cause because intentional agency\nneeds a body and actions occur within space-time. However, acceptance\nof the cosmological argument does not depend on an explanation of the\nmanner of causation by a necessary being. When we explain that the\ngirl raised her hand because she wanted to ask a question, we can\naccept that she was the cause of the raised hand without understanding\nhow her wanting to ask a question brought about her raising her hand.\nAs Swinburne notes, an event is \u201cfully explained when we have\ncited the agent, his intention that the event occur, and his basic\npowers\u201d that include the ability to bring about events of that\nsort (2004: 36). Similarly, theists argue, we may never know why and\nhow creation took place. Nevertheless, we may accept it as an\nexplanation in the sense that we can say that God created that initial\nevent, that he had the intention to do so, and that such an event lies\nwithin the power of an omniscient and almighty being; not having a\nbody is irrelevant.\n\nThe issues raised by the kal\u0101m argument concern not only\nthe nature of explanation and when an explanation is necessary, but\neven whether an explanation of the universe is possible (given the\nabove discussion). Whereas all agree that it makes no sense to ask\nabout what occurs before the Big Bang (since there was no prior time)\nor about something coming out of nothing, the dispute rests on whether\nthere needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether\nsomething like the universe can be finite and yet not have a\nbeginning, and crucially the nature of infinities and their connection\nwith reality.\n8. An Inductive Cosmological Argument\n\nRichard Swinburne contends that the cosmological argument is not\ndeductively valid; if it were, \n\n\nit would be incoherent to assert that a complex physical universe\nexists and that God does not exist. There would be a hidden\ncontradiction buried in such co-assertions\u2026. [A]ttempts to\nderive obviously incoherent propositions from such co-assertions have\nfailed through commission of some elementary logical error. (2004:\n136) \n\n\nSwinburne is correct that if someone believes that a deductive\ncosmological argument (proof) for God\u2019s existence is sound, then\nit would be incoherent for that same person to then deny that God\nexists. However, in their respective proofs defenders of the deductive\ncosmological arguments make a claim about incoherence, namely, that it\nwould be contradictory for the same person to affirm the premises of\nthe argument and to claim that God or a personal necessary being does\nnot exist. And they believe both that the respective premises have the\nintuitiveness that Swinburne deems necessary and that the argument has\nnot committed some \u201celementary error of logic\u201d. \n\nHas Swinburne shown incoherence? Whereas propositions are true and\ndeductive arguments are valid independent of anyone\u2019s beliefs\nthat they are true and valid (the proposition that the earth orbits\nthe sun is true regardless of whether anyone believes it), the\nacceptance of premises as true, of deductive arguments as valid, and\nof an argument\u2019s use as a proof is not independent of those same\nbeliefs. An argument that one person takes as being sound another\nmight believe not to be sound, in that the person rejects one or more\nof the premises or holds that the conclusions fail to properly follow;\narguments are person-relative in their persuasive value or assessment\nof coherence. Swinburne himself notes that arguments of coherence and\nincoherence are persuasive only to the extent that someone accepts\nother statements inherent to the proof as coherent or incoherent and\nthat one statement entails another (1993: 39). Elsewhere Swinburne\nadmits to having \n\n\nsome doubt about whether men have enough initial consensus about what\nis coherent and what entails what, are clever enough and have enough\nimagination to reach agreed proofs which would settle all disputes\nabout whether a statement is coherent or incoherent. (1993: 45) \n\n\nAs such, Swinburne cannot so easily dismiss deductive cosmological\narguments, although he is justified in wondering whether\n\u201creasons less strong than compelling proofs can be given for\nthinking some statements coherent and others incoherent\u201d (1993:\n45).\n\nIn place of a deductive argument, Swinburne develops an inductive\ncosmological argument that appeals to the inference to the best\nexplanation. Swinburne distinguishes between two varieties of\ninductive arguments: those that show that the conclusion is more\nprobable than not (what he terms a correct P-inductive argument) and\nthose that further increase the probability of the conclusion (what he\nterms a correct C-inductive argument). In The Existence of\nGod (1979) he presents a cosmological argument that he claims\nfalls in the category of C-inductive arguments. However, for him this\nargument is part of a larger, cumulative case for a P-inductive\nargument for God\u2019s existence that includes as its evidence the\norderliness of the universe, the existence of consciousness, miracle\nreports, and religious experience.\n\nSwinburne notes that \u201ca cosmological argument argues that the\nfact that there is a universe needs explaining\u201d (2004:\n9\u201310). However, he emphasizes that his approach differs from\nthose we have already considered in that he rejects the Principle of\nSufficient Reason understood as \u201ceverything not\n\u2018metaphysically necessary\u2019 has an explanation in something\n\u2018metaphysically necessary\u2019\u201d (2004: 148), for the PSR\nleads, as it does in Leibniz, to a being that is logically necessary,\nand such a being cannot explain the logically contingent. From the\nlogically necessary only the logically necessary follows. In place of\nusing the PSR to construct a deductive argument, he employs a\n\u201cbasic theorem of confirmation theory\u201d, Bayes\u2019\nTheorem, to construct an inductive argument (2004: 67). (In making\nthis claim about the need for an explanation of the universe,\nhowever, it is hard not to see that he invokes some formulation of the\nPSR.)\n\nSwinburne begins his discussion with the existence of a physical\nuniverse that (a) contains odd events that cannot be fitted into the\nestablished pattern of scientific explanation (e.g., miracles, the\nappearance of conscious beings), (b) is too big in that science cannot\nexplain why there are states of affairs at all or why the fundamental\nnatural laws to which science appeals to explain things hold, and (c)\nis complex (its matter-energy has relevant powers) (2004: 74, 150).\n\n\nIt is not logically necessary that the existence of the universe needs\nexplanation; we could accept this universe as a brute, inexplicable\nfact, but Swinburne thinks that to do so fails to accord with the\nexample of the sciences, which seek the best explanation for any given\nphenomena. Since \u201cit is reasonable to suppose\u201d that there\nis an explanation (2004: 75), the issue, then, is which view is more\nreasonable: that science can provide a natural explanation for the\nexistence of this universe, or whether the universe and its phenomena\nexist because of the intentional, causal activity of a personal being\nwhose existence also is a brute fact.\n\nTo find the explanatory hypothesis most likely to be true, especially\nabout something that might be unobservable, he claims to follow the\nexample of science. Using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, he looks for a\nhypothesis \\(h\\) such that \\(p(e\\mid h \\amp k) \\gt p(e\\mid k)\\) where\n\\(p\\) is probability, \\(e\\) is the existence of a complex universe,\nand \\(k\\) is the background data. A hypothesis is more likely to be\ntrue (1) in so far as it has high explanatory power, in that it makes\nprobable the evidence of the observation; this may be predictive but\ncan be postdictive as well (Swinburne 1996: 34, 2001: 80\u201381),\nand insofar as the evidence is very unlikely to occur if the\nhypothesis is false. And (2), it has a greater prior probability. The\nprior probability of a hypothesis encompasses three features: (a) how\nwell it fits with our background knowledge (2001: 81). The broader the\nscope, the less relevant this criterion becomes (2004: 60). Since\nthere are no \u201cneighboring fields of inquiry related to the\norigin of the universe\u201d, Swinburne treats this condition in the\ncosmological argument as irrelevant or reducing to the feature of\nsimplicity (1996: 29). (b) The scope of the hypothesis (the extent of\nits claims)\u2014the broader the scope, the less likely it is to be\ntrue. For example, all crows are black is less likely to be true than\nall crows along the upper Mississippi River are black. Since both\nscientific naturalism and theism have the same scope\u2014explaining\nthe universe, this does not factor into his calculations for\nexplaining the complex universe (2001: 82); and (c) simplicity, which\nfor Swinburne holds the key (2001: 82\u201383).\n\nHe holds that we are looking for a complete explanation, where \n\n\nwe may reasonably conclude that the criteria for supposing that\nfactors have no further explanation (scientific or personal) in terms\nof factors acting at the time and so that any explanation is a\ncomplete explanation over all (not just a complete explanation within\nscientific or within personal explanation) are that any attempt to go\nbeyond the factors that we have would result in no gain of explanatory\npower or prior probability. (2004: 89) \n\n\nA scientific explanation fails to give a complete explanation. It\nleaves us not with a simple but with a very complex explanatory\nhypothesis, in that \u201cultimate explanation stops at innumerable,\ndifferent stopping points, many of them \u2026 having exactly the\nsame powers and liabilities as each other\u201d (1996: 42). It\npresents us with the brute fact of the existence of the universe, not\nan explanation for it. It explains in terms of a full cause the events\nat any moment, but it cannot provide a complete explanation of the\nuniverse, \u201cfor there are no physical causes apart from the\nuniverse itself and parts thereof\u201d (1984: 144).\n\nOn the other hand, a personal explanation, given in terms of the\nintentional actions of a person, is simpler and no explanatory power\nis lost. Further, a personal explanation can be understood, as in the\ncase of explaining basic actions, without knowing or understanding any\nof the natural causal conditions that enable one to bring it about. In\nthe case of the cosmological argument, personal explanation is couched\nin terms of a being that has beliefs, purposes, and intentions, and\npossesses both the power to bring about the complex universe and a\npossible reason for doing so.\n\nSwinburne argues that a personal explanation of the universe satisfies\nthe above probability criteria. It satisfies condition (1) in that\nappealing to God as an intentional agent has explanatory power. It\nleads us to have certain expectations about the universe: that it\nmanifests order, is comprehensible, and favors the existence of beings\nthat can comprehend it. It makes probable the existence of the complex\nuniverse because God could have reasons for causing such a universe,\nwhereas we would have no reasons at all if all we had was the brute\nfact of the material universe. Among these reasons is that the\nuniverse would be \u201ca theatre for finite agents to develop and\nmake of it what they will\u201d (Swinburne 1979: 131).\n\nMichael Martin objects at this point. Martin contends that if\nSwinburne is to compare the a priori probability of there\nbeing a complex universe given our background knowledge with the a\npriori probability of a complex universe given our background\nknowledge and the existence of God, he has to be clear on how he\ninterprets the probability. Martin notes that herein lies crucial\nambiguity that disables calculating the a priori probability.\nIf one compares the very many possible complex universes with there\nbeing no universe, on the basis of assigning equal\nprobability to all possibilities the probability of there being a\ncomplex universe is nearly 1. However, if one compares the probability\nof there being a complex universe with there being no universe at all,\nit is 50 percent (Martin 1986: 155). Furthermore, Martin wonders\nwhether complexity is an issue at all. According to Swinburne, as free\nGod can create any kind of world or no world at all. But then the\nexistence of God is compatible with any number of scenarios: the\nexistence of no world, a simpler world than we have, one like ours, or\nany number of more complex universes. Consequently, the complexity of\nthis world does not matter in constructing an inductive\nargument for God\u2019s existence (1986: 155). Put another way,\nadding the existence of God to our background knowledge does not\nincrease the likelihood of there being a complex universe, let alone\nof there being this particular universe or a universe at all (1986:\n158). \n\nIn short, Martin does not see how Swinburne can establish an a\npriori probability for the existence of a complex universe, to be\ncompared with an a priori probability for the existence of\nGod based on simplicity, a feature of Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\nargument. This introduces the theme of simplicity, to which Swinburne\ndevotes much attention.\n\nSwinburne goes on to argue that a personal explanation in terms of God\nsatisfies condition (2) because of its simplicity. If one is going to\nconstruct an explanatory hypothesis using the criterion of simplicity,\nGod rather than science is more likely to be the focus of the true\nexplanatory hypothesis. God is one and of one kind; polytheism is\nruled out. Moreover, God is the simplest kind of person there can be\nbecause a person is a being with power (to do intentional actions),\nknowledge, and freedom (to choose, uncaused, which actions to do), and\nin God these properties are infinite, and having infinite properties\nis simpler than having properties with limits, as humans do. \u201cIt\nis always simpler to postulate infinite or zero degrees of some\nproperty than a certain precise finite value of it\u201d (Swinburne\n1983: 385). Furthermore, God engages in simple causation, that is,\ncausation by simple intention. Swinburne concludes that although the\nprior likelihood of neither God nor the universe is particularly high,\nthe prior probability of a simple God exceeds that of a complex\nuniverse. Hence, if anything is to occur unexplained, it would be God,\nnot the universe.\n\nConsequently, if we are to explain the universe, we must appeal to a\npersonal explanation \n\n\nin terms of a person who is not part of the universe acting from\nwithout. This can be done if we suppose that such a person (God)\nbrings it about at each instant of time, that (the laws of nature)\n\\(L\\) operate. (Swinburne 1979: 126, 2004: 142) \n\n\nAlthough for Swinburne this argument does not make the existence of\nGod more probable than not (it is not a P-inductive argument), it does\nincrease the probability of God\u2019s existence (is a C-inductive\nargument) because it provides a more reasonable explanation for the\nuniverse than merely attributing it to the brute fact of the\nuniverse\u2019s existence. \n\n\nTheism does not make [certain phenomena] very probable; but nothing\nelse makes their occurrence in the least probable, and they cry out\nfor an explanation. A priori, theism is perhaps very\nunlikely, but it is far more likely than any rival supposition. Hence,\nour phenomena are substantial evidence for the truth of theism.\n(Swinburne 1979: 290)\n\n\nIn his critique of Swinburne, J. L. Mackie wonders whether personal\nexplanations are reducible to natural, scientific explanations. To\nimplement intentionality requires an entire system of neurological and\nmacro-biological conditions. Not only does God as nonphysical lack\nthese biological conditions, but these conditions are exceedingly\ncomplex, not simple. \u201cOnly by ignoring such key features [the\nrole of the body] do we get an analogue of supposed divine\naction\u201d (Mackie 1982: 100). When we incorporate these features,\nthe simplicity disappears.\n\nSwinburne replies that Mackie has misunderstood his argument.\n\u201cThe simplicity of the relation between intention and its\nrealization has nothing to do with how our will or intentions are\nrealized in practice\u201d (Swinburne 1983: 386). Even if we\nunderstand all the neural connections and firings, we may not achieve\nany better explanation of why persons intended to act as they did than\nsimply asking them why they acted as they did. This indicates that the\nexistence of intermediate physical causal links is not an essential\npart of personal explanation. In fact, Swinburne argues, since it is\neasier to understand the function of intention without invoking any\nphysical causal limitations, it makes it easier to understand the case\nof God who as nonphysical has no need for intermediary physical\nprocesses. Thus, he claims, Mackie missed the point about God when he\ninvokes the complexity of physical accounts. The point is that God can\nwill to act on his intentions directly, and this provides a simple\naccount or explanation of why things came to exist.\n\nThe critical aspect of Swinburne\u2019s argument is his almost total\nreliance in his inductive cosmological argument on simplicity as the\ndeciding factor between competing hypotheses regarding the cause of\nthe existence of the universe (2004: 333\u201334; 2010, 9;\nOstrowick). Swinburne has at least six understandings that one\nhypothesis is simpler than another. (1) It invokes the fewest number\nof entities (2004: 106; 1983: 386; 2001: 87; 2010, 5). This is a\nquantitative understanding. (2) It invokes the fewest kinds of\nentities\u2014a qualitative understanding (1983: 386, 2001: 87). (3)\nIt invokes entities with simple or few properties (1983: 386)\nSwinburne invokes a subcriterion that explanations are simpler when\nthe properties they invoke are observable (2010, 6). (4) It invokes\npowers, acquisition of beliefs, and consistency of intentions similar\nto ours when applied to personal explanation of rational behavior\n(2004: 61\u201364). (5) The explanation invokes the simplest\norganization of the features functioning in the explicans, e.g., laws\nor variables (2001: 83, 89\u201390). (6) Simplicity can be found in\nthe explicans in that it does not invoke extraneous features that are\nnot necessary to explain the effect (2001: 81).\n\nSwinburne holds that the appeal to God as an explanation is simpler in\nall of these\n ways.[4]\n Not only is there one entity and that entity is simple, the\nexplanation effectively has no organization of the features. The\nexplanation itself is simple. The appeal to God\u2019s causal\nactivity satisfies understanding or interpretation 6 in that it\ninvolves no extraneous entities to do the explaining and requires no\nintermediaries. God can bring about the effect by himself alone.\n\nSeveral important questions about simplicity arise. First, is\nsimplicity the criterion we should use to decide between hypotheses?\nFor one thing, simplicity is not always a reliable criterion for\ndetermining which hypothesis is true or which hypothesis provides the\nbest explanatory account. The rise of quantum explanations suggests\nthat the simplest account of the universe, for example, that of\nNewton, is not a complete and fully adequate account. The events in\nthe subatomic realm are far from explained simply. For another,\nalthough an explanation in terms of four factors might make an\nexplanation simpler, the reverse might hold: an explanation in terms\nof ten factors might be simpler than an explanation in terms of four\nbecause the relationships that hold between the ten factors are less\ncomplex than those that hold between the four, making for a simpler\nexplanation (Ostrowick 2012). In reply, Swinburne might grant this,\nbut argue that in these much more limited cases explanatory power,\nbackground knowledge, and scope now come into significant play in a\nway that they don\u2019t when addressing hypotheses explaining the\noddness, bigness, and complexity of the universe.\n\nSecond, why think that theism is simpler than naturalism? Oppy argues\nthat whereas both naturalism and theism equally fit the data and have\nthe same scope, naturalism is simpler, for theism is \n\n\ncommitted to two kinds of entities (the natural and the supernatural),\ntwo kinds of external relations (the natural and the supernatural),\ntwo kinds of causation (the natural and the supernatural), two kinds\nof non-topic-neutral properties (the natural and the supernatural),\nand so on, whereas naturalism is committed to only one kind in each of\nthese categories. (2013: 52) \n\n\nIn conclusion, Swinburne contends that it is very unlikely\nthat a universe would exist uncaused, but more likely that\nGod would exist uncaused. It is likely that if there is a\nGod, he will make something like the finite and complex universe. The\npuzzling existence of the universe can be made comprehensible\n(explicable) if we suppose it is brought about by a personal God with\nintentional beliefs and the power to bring intentions to fruition\n(2004: 152). Whether simplicity can bear the weight of his argument is\nthe key matter in question.\n9. Necessary Being\n\nFinally, even if the cosmological argument is sound or cogent, the\ndifficult task remains to show, as part of natural theology, that the\nnecessary being to which the cosmological argument concludes is the\nGod of religion, and if so, of which religion. Rowe suggests that the\ncosmological argument has two parts, one to establish the existence of\na first cause or necessary being, the other that this necessary being\nis God (1975: 6). It is unclear, however, whether the second\ncontention is an essential part of the cosmological argument. Although\nAquinas was quick to make the identification between God and the first\nmover or first cause (growing out of his contention that philosophy is\nthe handmaiden of theology, such that in philosophy faith seeks\nunderstanding, not confirmation), such identification seems to go\nbeyond the causal reasoning that informs the argument (although one\ncan argue that it is consistent with the larger picture of God and his\nproperties that Aquinas paints in his Summae). Some\n(Rasmussen, O\u2019Connor, Koons) have plowed ahead in developing\nthis stage 2 process by showing how and what\nproperties\u2014simplicity, unity, omnipotence, omniscience,\ngoodness, and so on\u2014might follow from the concept of a necessary\nbeing. It \u201chas implications that bring it into the neighborhood\nof God as traditionally conceived\u201d (O\u2019Connor 2008: 67).\nOthers have proposed a method of correlation, where to give any\nreligious substance to the concept of a necessary being, one conducts\na lengthy discussion of the supreme beings found in the diverse\nreligions and carefully correlates the properties of a necessary being\nwith those of a religious being. This is done to discern\ncompatibilities and incompatibilities (Attfield 1975).\n\nRegardless of the connection of a necessary being with religion, it is\nnecessary to flesh out the nature of the necessary being if one is to\nhold that the cosmological argument is informative. As O\u2019Connor\nnotes, the mere concept of a necessary being is \u201cquite\nthin\u201d. Along with classical Islamic defenders of the argument\n(e.g., al-Baghdadi, c. 1000), O\u2019Connor (2008: 88) concludes that\nthere is a necessary connection between a personal necessary being and\nits nature. He suggests that there is not a contingent but a\n\u201csubtle entailment relation\u201d between certain essential\nproperties like being perfectly powerful, perfectly free, and\nperfectly knowledgeable. For example, the \n\n\nextent of power seems to be a function of at least two variables: the\namount of work that can be performed in a single task and the range of\ntasks one is able to perform in a given circumstance.\u2026 Perfect\npower and freedom would require an essentially unlimited knowledge,\ncorresponding to the unlimited range of possibilities. (2008: 89) \n\n\nA necessary being must also be causally independent for its existence\nand thus transcendent (2008: 92). Similarly, Swinburne ties\nGod\u2019s perfection to his simplicity that, as we have seen,\nfunctions centrally in his argument.\n\nTwo notions of necessity are found in the conclusion to the deductive\nargument: \u201cNecessarily, a necessary being exists\u201d. The\nfirst is conditional necessity: the proposition is necessary given\nthat the premises are true and the argument valid. The other use\nconcerns what is meant by \u201cnecessary being\u201d.\nO\u2019Connor writes that God is absolutely necessary, by which he\nmeans that God is \u201cabsolutely invulnerable to\nnonexistence\u201d (2008: 70). \n\n\nThe concept of a necessary being is of one that could not have failed\nto exist, absolutely speaking. For such a being to be possible, it\nmust be such that it would exist in every possible circumstance,\nincluding the actual one. That\u2019s precisely why the question of\nits existence cannot arise, thereby ending the regress of explanation\nnonarbitrarily. (O\u2019Connor 2013: 42) \n\n\nFor him necessary existence is necessarily tied up with a particular\nnature (otherwise the existence would be contingent) but not\nderivative from it; God\u2019s existence entails his nature (2008:\n88). God\u2019s necessity is not logical (for there is no\ncontradiction in denying that such a being exists) but made possible\non explanatory grounds (the cosmological argument). However, we might\ninquire, if God could not have failed to exist, how does an absolutely\nnecessary being differ from a logically necessary being?\nO\u2019Connor goes on to argue that God\u2019s absolute necessity\ndoes not invoke the ontological argument. He agrees that by modal\nAxiom S5, if it is possible that a necessary being exists, it\nnecessarily exists (2008: 71), but denies that this invokes the\nontological argument, since it \u201cgives no reason to think that\nthe nature in question is genuinely possible, and not merely logically\nconsistent\u201d. However, one might wonder, what would one have to\nestablish to show that the existence of a necessary being understood\nin this sense is genuinely possible? (see Plantinga, God, Freedom,\nand Evil, 1967: 112). Gale himself admits that, given this view\nof necessity and S5, the ontological argument works although we\ndon\u2019t know how to properly construct it (Gale and Pruss 1999:\n462).\n\nOne way to understand the necessary being is as factually or\nmetaphysically necessary. In this understanding, the necessary being\nis \u201csheer, ultimate, unconditioned reality, without beginning or\nend\u201d (Hick 1960: 730). God\u2019s necessity refers to his\naseity, in that God does not depend on anything else for his\nexistence. It is from God\u2019s aseity that his eternity\nfollows.\n\n\nGod is not one fact amongst others, but is related asymmetrically to\nall other facts as that which determines them. This is the ultimate\ngiven circumstance, which it is not possible to go with either\nquestion or explanation. For to explain something means either to\nassign a cause to it or to show its place within some wider context in\nrelation to which it is no longer puzzling to us. However, the idea of\nthe self-existent Creator of everything other than himself is the idea\nof a reality which is beyond the scope of these explanatory\nprocedures. (Hick 1960: 733\u201334)\n\n\nGiven this reading of \u201cnecessary being\u201d, God as the\nnecessary being possesses metaphysical or factual necessity and\nlogical contingency (Hick 1960; Swinburne 2004: 79). If the necessary\nbeing exists at any time, then necessarily it exists at all times. If\nthe necessary being does not exist, it cannot come into existence.\nNothing can bring it into existence or cause it to cease to exist.\nThus, if God exists now, it is not coherent to suppose that any agent\ncan make it false that God exists (Swinburne 2004: 249, 266).\nO\u2019Connor objects that if the necessary being is contingent, it\njust happens to exist (2008: 70; see White (1979) for further\nobjections). However, one might reply that God does not just happen to\nexist; God exists because of his nature (although his nature does not\nprecede his existence).\n\nFurther considerations beyond the scope of the cosmological argument\nare in order to discern the relationship between a necessary being and\nthe properties often associated with a religious Ultimate. While\ndefenders of the cosmological argument point to the relevance and\nimportance of connecting the necessary being with natural theology,\ncritics find themselves freed from such endeavors.\n\nAfter all is presented and developed, it is clear that every thesis\nand argument we have considered, whether in support or critical of the\ncosmological argument, is seriously contested. Perhaps that is as it\nshould be when trying to answer the difficult questions whether the\nuniverse is contingent or necessary, caused or eternal, and if caused,\nwhy it exists or what brought it into being. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["al\u2013Baghdadi, Abu Mansur, [c.1000] 1981, <em>\u2018Usul\nal\u2013din</em>, 3rd edition Beirut: Dar al-kutub\nal\u2013\u2018ilmiyya.
