    "main_text": "Tools for Inference || Categorical Logic\n6.1 Categorical Logic\n\nIn [Syllogism] and [Short Syllogism]\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b recognizes three figures of categorical\nsyllogisms, following\n Aristotle.[15]\n In these three figures he recognizes respectively four, four, and six\nvalid moods, as listed by Smith (2022) but not always in the same\norder. (For example in [Syllogism] he puts Darii\nbefore Celarent). Following Aristotle again, he regards the\nfirst figure syllogisms as \u201cperfect\u201d, i.e., self-evident\nand not in need of justification. For the moods in second and third\nfigures he gives justifications by reduction to first figure,\nfollowing Aristotle in the main. (His chief departure from Aristotle\nin these justifications is that he never uses proof by reductio ad\nabsurdum, though he does recognize such proofs as valid.)\nAristotle\u2019s justification of\n Darapti[16]\n relies on the conversion implication: from \u201cEvery B is\nan A\u201d infer \u201cSome A is a B\u201d\n(cf. [Syllogism] 30.3). This implication fails to hold if we\nallow \u201cEvery B is an A\u201d to be true when\nthere are no Bs. Accordingly al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b declares\nthat \u201cEvery B is an A\u201d is false unless there\nis at least one B ([Categories] 124.14). Though he\nsometimes seems to forget he said this, he is the earliest logician on\nrecord as having spelled out this implication of \u201cEvery B\nis an A\u201d.\n\nProbably his main difference from Aristotle in categorical syllogisms\nis his treatment of the pairs of formal premises (i.e., with letters\nfor terms) where Aristotle says \u201cno syllogism occurs\u201d in\nthe sense that no syllogistic conclusion follows validly.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b calls these premise-pairs\n\u201cnonproductive\u201d (ghayr muntij). Aristotle had\nused the fact that valid inference rules preserve truth as a means to\nproving nonproductivity of a formal premise-pair; for any proposed\nconclusion, he found nouns that could be put for the letters, in such\na way that the premises came out true and the conclusion false. During\nthe Roman Empire period a tendency developed for logicians to skip\nthese proofs and fall back instead on \u201claws of syllogism\u201d\nthat were supposed to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a\npremise-pair to be productive (cf. Lee 1984: 119f). This was generally\na lapse from the rigor of Aristotle\u2019s work, because the\narguments given to justify the laws of syllogism were of a poor\nstandard. Though al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does once briefly mention\nAristotle\u2019s counterexample method ([Syllogism]\n20.2\u20135), in practice he relies entirely on the laws of\nsyllogism. By contrast the earlier logic texts of Paul the Persian and\nIbn al-Muqaffa\u2018, both heirs of the Alexandrian view, copied\nAristotle\u2019s nonproductivity proofs in categorical logic with\ntotal formal rigor. \n\nFor further discussion of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s categorical\nsyllogisms, see Chatti and Hodges 2020 and Chatti 2019.\n",
