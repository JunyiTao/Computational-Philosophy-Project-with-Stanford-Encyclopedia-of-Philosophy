    "preamble": "\n\n\nTraditionally, expressions in formal systems have been regarded as\nsignifying finite inscriptions which are\u2014at least in\nprinciple\u2014capable of actually being written out in primitive\nnotation. However, the fact that (first-order) formulas may be\nidentified with natural numbers (via \u201cG\u00f6del\nnumbering\u201d) and hence with finite sets makes it no\nlonger necessary to regard formulas as inscriptions, and suggests the\npossibility of fashioning \u201clanguages\u201d some of whose\nformulas would be naturally identified as infinite sets. A\n\u201clanguage\u201d of this kind is called an infinitary\nlanguage: in this article I discuss those infinitary languages\nwhich can be obtained in a straightforward manner from first-order\nlanguages by allowing conjunctions, disjunctions and, possibly,\nquantifier sequences, to be of infinite length. In the course of the\ndiscussion it will be seen that, while the expressive power of such\nlanguages far exceeds that of their finitary (first-order)\ncounterparts, very few of them possess the \u201cattractive\u201d\nfeatures (e.g., compactness and completeness) of the\nlatter. Accordingly, the infinitary languages that do in fact possess\nthese features merit special attention.\n\n\n\nIn \u00a71 the basic syntax and semantics of infinitary languages are\nlaid down; their expressive power is then displayed by means of\nexamples.  \u00a72 is devoted to those infinitary languages which\npermit only finite quantifier sequences: these languages turn out to\nbe relatively well-behaved. \u00a73 is devoted to a discussion of\nthe compactness problem for infinitary languages and its\nconnection with purely set-theoretical questions concerning\n\u201clarge\u201d cardinal numbers. In \u00a74 an argument is\nsketched which shows that most \u201cinfinite quantifier\u201d\nlanguages have a second-order nature and are, ipso\nfacto, highly incomplete. \u00a75 provides a brief account of a\ncertain special class of sublanguages of infinitary languages for\nwhich a satisfactory generalization of the compactness theorem can be\nproved. This section includes a subsection on the definition of\nadmissible sets. Historical and bibliographical remarks are provided\nin \u00a76.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Definition and Basic Properties of Infinitary Languages\n\n\nGiven a pair \u03ba, \u03bb of infinite cardinals such that \u03bb\n\u2264 \u03ba, we define a class of infinitary languages in each of\nwhich we may form conjunctions and disjunctions of sets of formulas of\ncardinality < \u03ba, and quantifications over sequences of\nvariables of length < \u03bb. \n\n\nLet\n L\n \u2014 the (finitary)\nbase language \u2014 be an arbitrary but fixed first-order\nlanguage with any number of extralogical symbols. The infinitary\nlanguage\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n has\nthe following basic symbols:\n\nAll symbols of\n L\nA set Var of individual variables, where the\ncardinality of Var (written: |Var|)\nis \u03ba\nA logical operator\n \u2227\n(infinitary conjunction)\n\n\n\nThe class of preformulas of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n is defined recursively as\nfollows:\n\nEach formula of\n L\n is a\npreformula;\nif \u03c6 and \u03c8 are preformulas, so are\n \u03c6\u2227\u03c8 and \u00ac\u03c6;\nif \u03a6 is a set of preformulas such that |\u03a6| < \u03ba,\nthen\n \u2227\u03a6\n is a\npreformula;\nif \u03c6 is a preformula and X \u2286 Var\nis such that |X| < \u03bb, then \u2203X\u03c6 is\na preformula;\nall preformulas are defined by the above clauses.\n\n\n\nIf \u03a6 is a set of preformulas indexed by a set I, say\n\u03a6 = {\u03c6i : i \u2208 I},\nthen we agree to write\n \u2227\u03a6\nfor:\n\n\u2227i\u2208I\u2009\u03c6\n\n\n\nor, if I is the set of natural numbers, we write\n \u2227\u03a6\n for:\n\u03c60\n \u2227\n\u03c61\n \u2227\n\u2026\n\n\nIf X is a set of individual variables indexed by an ordinal\n\u03b1, say X = {x\u03be : \u03be <\n\u03b1}, we agree to write\n(\u2203x\u03be)\u03be<\u03b1\u03c6 for\n\u2203X\u03c6.\n\n\nThe logical operators\n \u2228,\n \u2192,\n\u2194 are defined in the customary manner. We also introduce the\noperators\n \u2228\n (infinitary\ndisjunction) and \u2200 (universal quantification)\nby\n\u2228\u03a6\n=df\n \u00ac\u2227{\n\u00ac\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6} \n\n\n\n\u2200X\u03c6 =df \u00ac\u2203X\u00ac\u03c6,\n\n\n\nand employ similar conventions as for\n \u2227,\n \u2203 . \n\n\nThus\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n is\nthe infinitary language obtained from\n L\n by permitting conjunctions and disjunctions of length\n< \u03ba and quantifications[1]\n of length <\n\u03bb. Languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n are called finite-quantifier\nlanguages, the rest infinite-quantifier languages. Observe\nthat\n L(\u03c9,\u03c9)\n is\n just\n L itself.\n\n\nNotice the following anomaly which can arise in an\ninfinitary language but not in a finitary one. In the language\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9), which\nallows countably infinite conjunctions but only finite quantifications,\nthere are preformulas with so many free variables that they cannot be\n\u201cclosed\u201d into sentences of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)\n by prefixing quantifiers.\nSuch is the case, for example, for the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-preformula\nx0 < x1\n \u00a0\u2227\u00a0 x1\n< x2\n \u00a0\u2227\u00a0 \u2026\n \u00a0\u2227\u00a0 xn <\nxn+1 \u2026,\n\n\nwhere\n L\n contains the binary\nrelation symbol <. For this reason we make the following \nDefinition. A formula of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n is a preformula\nwhich contains < \u03bb free variables. The set of all formulas\n of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb) will be\ndenoted by Form(L(\u03ba,\u03bb)) or simply\nForm(\u03ba,\u03bb) and the set of all sentences by\nSent(L(\u03ba,\u03bb)) or simply\nSent(\u03ba,\u03bb).\n\n\nIn this connection, observe that, in general, nothing would be gained\nby considering \u201clanguages\u201d\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n with \u03bb > \u03ba. For\nexample, in the \u201clanguage\u201d\n L(\u03c9,\u03c91), formulas will have only\nfinitely many free variables, while there will be a host of \u201cuseless\u201d\nquantifiers able to bind infinitely many free\n variables.[2]\n\n\nHaving defined the syntax of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb),\n we next sketch its\nsemantics. Since the extralogical symbols of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n are just those\n of\n L, and it is these symbols which\ndetermine the form of the structures in which a given first-order\nlanguage is to be interpreted, it is natural to define an\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)-structure\n to be\nsimply an\n L-structure.\n The notion\nof a formula of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n being satisfied in an\n L-structure\nA (by a sequence of elements from the domain\nof A) is defined in the same inductive manner\nas for formulas of\n L\n except that\nwe must add two extra clauses corresponding to the clauses for\n \u2227\u03a6\n and \u2203X\u03c6 in the\ndefinition of preformula. In these two cases we naturally define:\n\u2227\u03a6 is satisfied\nin A (by a given sequence) \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c6 is satisfied in\nA (by the sequence); \n\n\n\n\u2203X\u03c6 is satisfied in A\n\u00a0\u21d4\u00a0 there is a sequence of elements from the domain of\nA in bijective correspondence with X\nwhich satisfies \u03c6 in A.\n\n\n\nThese informal definitions need to be tightened up in a rigorous\ndevelopment, but their meaning should be clear to the reader. Now the\nusual notions of truth, validity, satisfiability, and\nmodel for formulas and sentences of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n become available. In particular, if\nA is an\n L-structure\n and \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(\u03ba,\u03bb), we shall write\nA\n \u22a8\n\u03c3\n for A is a model of \u03c3, and\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 for \u03c3 is valid,\nthat is, for all A,\nA\n \u22a8\n\u03c3.\n If \u0394 \u2286 Sent(\u03ba,\u03bb), we\nshall write \u0394\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 for\n\u03c3 is a logical consequence of \u0394, that is, each\nmodel of \u0394 is a model of \u03c3.\n\n\nWe now give some examples intended to display the expressive power\nof the infinitary languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n with \u03ba \u2265\n\u03c91. In each case it is well-known that the notion in\nquestion cannot be expressed in any first-order language.\n\nCharacterization of the standard model of arithmetic\nin\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9). Here the standard\nmodel of arithmetic is the structure N =\n\u27e8N, +, \u00b7, s, 0\u27e9, where N is the set\nof natural numbers, +, \u00b7, and 0 have their usual meanings, and\ns is the successor operation. Let\n L\n be the first-order language appropriate for\nN. Then the class of\n L-structures\n isomorphic to N coincides\nwith the class of models of the conjunction of the following\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)\nsentences (where 0 is a name of 0):\n\n\n\u2227m\u2208\u03c9\n\u2227n\u2208\u03c9\nsm0 +\nsn0 =\nsm+n0\n\n\n\u2227m\u2208\u03c9\n\u2227n\u2208\u03c9\nsm0\n\u00b7 sn0 =\nsm\u00b7n0\n\n\n\u2227m\u2208\u03c9\n\u2227n\u2208\u03c9\u2212{m}\nsm0\n\u2260 sn0\n\n\n\u2200x\u2228m\u2208\u03c9\nx =\nsm0\n\n\n\n\nThe terms snx are defined recursively by\n\n\n\ns0x\n = \nx\n\n\nsn+1x\n = \ns(snx)\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of the class of all finite sets in\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9).\nHere the base language has no extralogical symbols. The class of all\nfinite sets then coincides with the class of models of the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence\n\u2228n\u2208\u03c9\n\u2203v0 \u2026\n\u2203vn\u2200x(x =\nv0\n \u2228\n \u2026\n \u2228\n x =\nvn).\n\nTruth definition in\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9) for a countable\nbase language\nL.\n\n Let\n L be a countable first-order\nlanguage (for example, the language of arithmetic or set theory) which\ncontains a name n for each natural number\nn, and let \u03c30, \u03c31, \u2026\nbe an enumeration of its sentences. Then the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-formula\nTr(x)\n\u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u2228n\u2208\u03c9 (x =\nn\n \u2227\n\u03c3n)\n\n\nis a truth predicate for\n L\n inasmuch as the sentence \nTr(n) \u2194\n\u03c3n\n\n\nis valid for each n. \n\nCharacterization of well-orderings in\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91). The base\nlanguage\n L\n here includes a binary\npredicate symbol \u2264. Let \u03c31 be the usual\n L-sentence\n characterizing linear\norderings. Then the class of\n L-structures\n in which the interpretation of \u2264 is a\nwell-ordering coincides with the class of models of the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91) sentence\n\u03c3 = \u03c31\n \u2227\n\u03c32, where\n\u03c32 =df\n(\u2200vn)n\u2208\u03c9\n\u2203x\n [\u2228n\u2208\u03c9 (x =\nvn)\n \u2227\n \u2227n\u2208\u03c9\n(x \u2264 vn)].\n\n\nNotice that the sentence \u03c32 contains an infinite\nquantifier: it expresses the essentially second-order\nassertion that every countable subset has a least member. It can in\nfact be shown that the presence of this infinite quantifier is\nessential: the class of well-ordered structures cannot be characterized\nin any finite-quantifier language. This example indicates that\ninfinite-quantifier languages such as\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91) behave rather\nlike second-order languages; we shall see that they share the latters'\ndefects (incompleteness) as well as some of their advantages (strong\nexpressive power). \n\n\nMany extensions of first-order languages can be translated\ninto infinitary languages. For example, consider the generalized\nquantifier language\n L(Q0) obtained from\n L\n by adding a new quantifier symbol\nQ0 and interpreting\nQ0x\u03c6(x) as there exist\ninfinitely many x such that \u03c6(x). It is easily seen\nthat the sentence Q0x\u03c6(x) has\nthe same models as the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence\n\u00ac\u2228n\u2208\u03c9\n\u2203v0\u2026\u2203vn\u2200\nx[\u03c6(x) \u2192 (x = v0\n \u2228\n \u2026\n \u2228\nx = vn)].\n\n\nThus\n L(Q0)\nis, in a natural sense, translatable into\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9). Another language\ntranslatable into\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) in this sense is the\nweak second-order language obtained by adding a countable set\nof monadic predicate variables to\n L\n which are then interpreted as ranging over all\nfinite sets of individuals.\n\n\nLanguages with arbitrarily long conjunctions, disjunctions and\n(possibly) quantifications may also be introduced. For a fixed infinite\ncardinal \u03bb, the language\n L(\u221e,\u03bb)\n is defined by specifying its class\nof formulas, Form(\u221e,\u03bb), to be the union,\nover all \u03ba \u2265 \u03bb, of the sets\nForm(\u03ba,\u03bb). Thus\n L(\u221e,\u03bb)\n allows arbitrarily long conjunctions\nand disjunctions, in the sense that if \u03a6 is an arbitrary subset of\nForm(\u221e,\u03bb), then both\n \u2227\u03a6\n and\n \u2228\u03a6\n are members of\nForm(\u221e,\u03bb). But\n L(\u221e,\u03bb)\n admits only quantifications of\nlength < \u03bb: all its formulas have < \u03bb free\nvariables. The language\n L(\u221e,\u221e)\n is defined in turn by specifying its\nclass of formulas, Form(\u221e,\u221e), to be the\nunion, over all infinite cardinals \u03bb, of the classes\nForm(\u221e,\u03bb). So\n L(\u221e,\u221e)\n allows arbitrarily long\nquantifications in addition to arbitrarily long conjunctions and\ndisjunctions. Note that Form(\u221e,\u03bb) and\nForm(\u221e,\u221e) are proper classes in the sense\nof G\u00f6del-Bernays set theory. Satisfaction of formulas of\n L(\u221e,\u03bb)\n and\n L(\u221e,\u221e)\n in a structure may\nbe defined by an obvious extension of the corresponding notion for\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb).\n2. Finite-Quantifier Languages\n\n\nWe have remarked that infinite-quantifier languages such as\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91) resemble\nsecond-order languages inasmuch as they allow quantification over\ninfinite sets of individuals. The fact that this is not permitted in\nfinite-quantifier languages suggests that these may be in certain\nrespects closer to their first-order counterparts than might be evident\nat first sight. We shall see that this is indeed the case, notably in\nthe case of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9). \n\n\nThe language\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) occupies a special place\namong infinitary languages because\u2014like first-order\nlanguages\u2014it admits an effective deductive apparatus. In\nfact, let us add to the usual first-order axioms and rules of inference\nthe new axiom scheme\n\u2227\u03a6 \u2192\n\u03c6\n\n\nfor any countable set \u03a6 \u2286\nForm(\u03c91,\u03c9) and any \u03c6 \u2208\n\u03a6, together with the new rule of inference \n\n\n\n\u03c60,\n \u03c61, \u2026, \u03c6n, \u2026\n\n\n\u2227n\u2208\u03c9\n\u03c6n\n\n\n\n\n\nand allow deductions to be of countable length. Writing\n \u22a2*\n for deducibility in this sense, we\nthen have the \nL(\u03c91,\u03c9)-Completeness\nTheorem. For any \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9),\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\n \u22a2*\u03c3\n\n\nAs an immediate corollary we infer that this deductive apparatus is\nadequate for deductions from countable sets of premises in\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9).\nThat is, with the obvious extension of notation, we have, for any\ncountable set \u0394 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) \n(2.1)\u00a0\u0394\n \u22a8\n\u03c3\n \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\n \u0394\u22a2*\u03c3\n\n\nThis completeness theorem can be proved by modifying the usual\nHenkin completeness proof for first-order logic, or by employing\nBoolean-algebraic methods. Similar arguments, applied to suitable\nfurther augmentations of the axioms and rules of inference, yield\nanalogous completeness theorems for many other finite-quantifier\nlanguages.\n\n\nIf just deductions of countable length are admitted, then no\ndeductive apparatus for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) can be set up which is\nadequate for deductions from arbitrary sets of premises, that\nis, for which (2.1) would hold for every set \u0394 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9), regardless of\ncardinality. This follows from the simple observation that there\nis a first-order language\n L\n and\nan uncountable set \u0393 of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentences such that\n\u0393 has no model but every countable subset of \u0393\ndoes. To see this, let\n L\nbe\n the language of arithmetic augmented by \u03c91 new\nconstant symbols {c\u03be : \u03be\n< \u03c91} and let \u0393 be the set of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentences {\u03c3} \u222a\n{c\u03be \u2260\nc\u03b7 : \u03be \u2260 \u03b7}, where\n\u03c3 is the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence characterizing\nthe standard model of arithmetic. This example also shows that the\ncompactness theorem fails for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) and so also for any\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n with \u03ba \u2265\n\u03c91.\n\n\nAnother result which holds in the first-order case but fails\n for\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9) with \u03ba\n\u2265 \u03c91 (and also for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91), although\nthis is more difficult to prove) is the prenex normal form\ntheorem. A sentence is prenex if all its quantifiers\nappear at the front; we give an example of an\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence which is not\nequivalent to a conjunction of prenex sentences. Let\n L\n be the first-order language without\nextralogical symbols and let \u03c3 be the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence which\ncharacterizes the class of finite sets. Suppose that \u03c3 were\nequivalent to a conjunction\n\u2227i\u2208I\n\u03c3i\n\n\nof prenex\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentences\n\u03c3i. Then each \u03c3i is\nof the form \nQ1x1 \u2026\nQnxn\n\u03c6i(x1,\u2026,\nxn),\n\n\nwhere each Qk is \u2200 or \u2203 and\n\u03c6i is a (possibly infinitary) conjunction or\ndisjunction of formulas of the form xk =\nxl or xk \u2260\nxl. Since each \u03c3i is a\nsentence, there are only finitely many variables in each\n\u03c6i, and it is easy to see that each\n\u03c6i is then equivalent to a first-order formula.\nAccordingly each \u03c3i may be taken to be a\nfirst-order sentence. Since \u03c3 is assumed to be equivalent to the\nconjunction of the \u03c3i, it follows that\n\u03c3 and the set \u0394 = {\u03c3i :\ni \u2208 I} have the same models. But obviously\n\u03c3, and hence also \u0394, have models of all finite\ncardinalities; the compactness theorem for sets of first-order\nsentences now implies that \u0394, and hence also \u03c3, has an\ninfinite model, contradicting the definition of \u03c3. \n\n\nTurning to the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, we find that\nthe downward version has adequate generalizations to\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) (and,\nindeed, to all infinitary languages). In fact, one can show in much the\nsame way as for sets of first-order sentences that if \u0394 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) has an infinite\nmodel of cardinality \u2265 |\u0394|, it has a model of cardinality the\nlarger of\n \u21350, |\u0394|.\nIn particular, any\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence with an infinite\nmodel has a countable model.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\nin its usual form fails for all infinitary languages. For\nexample, the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence characterizing\nthe standard model of arithmetic has a model of cardinality\n \u21350 but no models of any other\ncardinality. However, all is not lost here, as we shall see.\n\n\nWe define the Hanf number h(L) of a\nlanguage L to be the least cardinal \u03ba such that, if an\nL-sentence has a model of cardinality \u03ba, it has\nmodels of arbitrarily large cardinality. The existence of\nh(L) is readily established. For each\nL-sentence \u03c3 not possessing models of\narbitrarily large cardinality let \u03ba(\u03c3) be the least\ncardinal \u03ba such that \u03c3 does not have a model of cardinality\n\u03ba. If \u03bb is the supremum of all the \u03ba(\u03c3), then,\nif a sentence of L has a model of cardinality\n\u03bb, it has models of arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\n\nDefine the cardinals \u03bc(\u03b1) recursively by\n\n\n\n\u03bc(0)\n = \n\u21350\n\n\n\u03bc(\u03b1+1)\n = \n2\u03bc(\u03b1)\n\n\n\u03bc(\u03bb)\n = \n\u2211\u03b1<\u03bb \u03bc(\u03b1),\nfor limit \u03bb.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen it can be shown that \nh(L(\u03c91,\u03c9)) =\n\u03bc(\u03c91),\n\n\nsimilar results holding for other finite-quantifier languages. The\nvalues of the Hanf numbers of infinite-quantifier languages such\n as\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91) are sensitive\nto the presence or otherwise of large cardinals, but must in any case\ngreatly exceed that of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9). \n\n\nA result for\n L\n which\ngeneralizes to\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) but to no other\ninfinitary language is the\nCraig Interpolation Theorem: If\n\u03c3,\u03c4 \u2208 Sent(\u03c91,\u03c9)\nare such that\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 \u2192\n\u03c4, then there is \u03b8 \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 \u2192 \u03b8 and\n \u22a8\n \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c4, and each\nextralogical symbol occurring in \u03b8 occurs in both \u03c3 and\n\u03c4.\n\n\nThe proof is a reasonably straightforward extension of the first-order\ncase. \n\n\nFinally, we mention one further result which generalizes nicely\n to\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)\nbut to no other infinitary language. It is well known that, if\nA is any finite\n L-structure\n with only finitely many relations, there is\nan\n L-sentence\n \u03c3\ncharacterizing A up to isomorphism. For\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) we have\nthe following generalization known as\nScott's Isomorphism Theorem. If\nA is a countable\n L-structure\n with only countably many relations, then\nthere is an\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence whose class of\ncountable models coincides with the class of\n L-structures\n isomorphic with\nA.\n\n\nThe restriction to countable structures is essential because\ncountability cannot in general be expressed by an\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9)-sentence. \n\n\nThe language\n L(\u221e,\u03c9)\n may also be counted as a\nfinite-quantifier language. The concept of equivalence of structures\nwith respect to this language is of especial significance: we call two\n(similar) structures A and\nB (\u221e,\u03c9)-equivalent,\nwritten A \u2261\u221e\u03c9\nB, if the same sentences of\n L(\u221e,\u03c9)\n hold in both\nA and B. This\nrelation can, first of all, be characterized in terms of the notion of\npartial isomorphism. A partial isomorphism between\nA and B is a\nnonempty family P of maps such that:\n\nFor each p \u2208 P, dom(p) is a\nsubstructure of A, ran(p) is a\nsubstructure of B, and p is an isomorphism of\nits domain onto its range; and\nIf p \u2208 P, a \u2208\nA, b \u2208\nB, then there exist r, s\n\u2208 P both extending p such that a \u2208\ndom(r), b \u2208 ran(s) (\u201cback and forth\u201d\nproperty).\n\n\n\nIf a partial isomorphism exists between A\nand B, we say that\nA and B are\npartially isomorphic and write A\n\u2245p B. We\nthen have\nKarp's Partial Isomorphism Theorem.\n\n For any similar structures A,\nB, A\n\u2261\u221e\u03c9 B \u21d4\nA\n\u2245p\nB.\n\n\nThere is also a version of Scott's isomorphism theorem for\n L(\u221e,\u03c9),\n namely,\n(2.2) Given any structure A,\nthere is an\n L(\u221e,\u03c9)-sentence\n \u03c3 such that, for all\nstructures B, A\n\u2245p\nB \u21d4 B\n \u22a8\n \u03c3.\n\n\nPartial isomorphism and (\u221e,\u03c9)-equivalence are related to\nthe notion of Boolean isomorphism. To define this we need to\nintroduce the idea of a Boolean-valued model of set theory. Given a\ncomplete Boolean algebra B, the universe\nV(B) of B-valued sets, also known\nas the B-extension of the universe V of sets, is obtained by\nfirst defining, recursively on \u03b1,\nV\u03b1(B) \n =\n{x: x is a function\n \u2227\n range(x) \u2286 B\n \u2227\n \u2203\u03be<\u03b1[domain(x) \u2286\nV\u03be(B)]}\n\n\nand then setting\nV(B) = {x:\n\u2203\u03b1(x \u2208\nV\u03b1(B))}.\n\n\nMembers of V(B) are called B-valued\nsets. It is now easily seen that a B-valued set is\nprecisely a B-valued function with domain a set of\nB-valued sets. Now let L be the first-order\nlanguage of set theory and let\nL(B) be the language obtained by\nadding to L a name for each element of\nV(B) (we shall use the same symbol for the\nelement and its name). One can now construct a mapping\n[\u00b7](B) of the (sentences of the) language\nL(B) into B: for each\nsentence \u03c3 of L(B), the\nelement [\u03c3](B) of B is the \u201cBoolean\ntruth value\u201d of \u03c3 in V(B). This\nmapping [\u00b7](B) is defined so as to send all\nthe theorems of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to the top element 1 of\nB, i.e., to \u201ctruth\u201d; accordingly,\nV(B) may be thought of as a\nBoolean-valued model of set theory. In general, if\n[\u03c3](B) = 1, we say that \u03c3 is\nvalid in V(B), and write\nV(B)\n \u22a8\n\u03c3.\n\n\nNow each x \u2208 V has a canonical representative\n\nx in V(B), satisfying\n\nx = y iff V(B)\n \u22a8\n x = y\n\nx \u2208 y iff V(B)\n \u22a8\n x \u2208\n\ny\n\n\nWe say that two similar structures A,\nB are Boolean isomorphic, written\nA\n\u2245b B, if, for\nsome complete Boolean algebra B, we have\nV(B)\n \u22a8\nA\n\u2245\nB, that is, if there is a Boolean\nextension of the universe of sets in which the canonical\nrepresentatives of A and\nB are isomorphic with Boolean value 1. It can\nthen be shown that: \n(2.3) A\n\u2261\u221e\u03c9 B \u21d4\nA\n\u2245b\nB.\n\n\nThis result can be strengthened through category-theoretic formulation.\nFor this we require the concept of a(n) (elementary) topos. To\nintroduce this concept, we start with the familiary category of\nSet of sets and mappings. Set has the\nfollowing key properties: \n\nThere is a \u201cterminal\u201d object 1 such that, for any object\nX, there is a unique map X \u2192 1 (for 1 we may\ntake any one-element set, in particular, {0}).\nAny pair of objects X,Y has a Cartesian product X\n\u00d7 Y.\nfor any pair of objects one can form the \u201cexponential\u201d object\nYX of all maps from X \u2192\nY.\nThere is a \u201ctruth-value\u201d object \u03a9 such that for each object\nX there is a natural correspondence between subobjects\n(subsets) of X and maps X \u2192 \u03a9. (For\n\u03a9 we may take the set 2 = {0,1}; maps X \u2192 \u03a9\nare then characteristic functions on X.)\n\n\n\nAll four of these conditions can be formulated in category-theoretic\nlanguage \u2014 a category satisfying them is called a topos.\nThe category Set is a topos; so also are (i) the\ncategory Set(B) of Boolean-valued\nsets and mappings in any Boolean extension\nV(B) of the universe of sets; (ii) the\ncategory of sheaves of sets on a topological space; (iii) the category\nof all diagrams of maps of sets\nX0 \u2192 X1 \u2192\nX2 \u2192 \u2026\n\n\nThe objects of each of these categories may be regarded as sets\nwhich are varying in some manner: in case (i) over a\nBoolean algebra; in case (ii) over a topological\nspace; in case (iii) over (discrete) time. A topos may be\nconceived, then, as a universe of \u201cvariable\u201d sets. The familiar\ncategory Set is the special limiting case of a topos\nin which the \u201cvariation\u201d of the objects has been reduced to zero.\n\n\nJust as in set theory, \u201clogical operators\u201d can be defined on the\ntruth-value object in any topos. These are maps \u00ac: \u03a9 \u2192\n\u03a9;\n \u2227, \u2228, \u21d2: \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\ncorresponding to the logical operations of negation, conjunction,\ndisjunction and implication. With these operations, \u03a9 becomes a\nHeyting algebra, thus embodying in general the laws not of classical\nbut of intutionistic logic. In this sense intuitionistic logic is\n\u201cinternalized\u201d in a topos: intuitionistic logic is the logic of\nvariable sets. (Of course, classical logic is internalized in certain\ntoposes, for instance Set and\nSet(B) for any complete Boolean\nalgebra B.)\n\n\nAny topos may be conceived as possible \u201cuniverse of discourse\u201d in\nwhich mathematical assertions may be interpreted and mathematical\nconstructions may be performed. Mathematical assertions are rendered\ninterpretable in a topos\n E\n by\nexpression within\n E's\ninternal language \u2014 a type-theoretic version of the\nusual language of set theory. In a manner analogous to Boolean-valued\nvalidity, one can introduce an appropriate notion of validity in\n E\n of a sentence \u03c3 of its\ninternal language. Again, we write\n E\n\n \u22a8 \u03c3 for\n\u201c\u03c3 is valid in\n E\u201d.\n\n\nA topos\n E\n is said to be\nfull if, for any set I, the I-fold\ncopower[3]\n \u2210I1 of its terminal object exists\n in\n E.\n \u2210I1 may be thought of as the\ncanonical representative in\n E\n of\nthe set I; accordingly, we write it simply as\nI. (In V(B) this coincides\nwith I as previously defined.) All the toposes\nmentioned above are full.\n\n\nNow let\n E\n be a full topos. If\nA = (A, R, \u2026) is a\nstructure, write A for\n(A, R, \u2026). \nTwo structures\nA and B are said to\nbe topos isomorphic, written A\n\u2245t\nB, if, for some topos\n E\n defined over the category of sets, we have\n E\n\n \u22a8 A\n\u2245\nB. In other words two structures are topos isomorphic\nif their canonical representatives are isomorphic in the internal\nlanguage of some topos. It can then be shown that\n(2.4) A\n\u2261\u221e\u03c9 B \u21d4\nA\n\u2245t\nB.\n\n\nAccordingly (\u221e,\u03c9)-equivalence may be regarded as\nisomorphism in the extremely general context of universes of \u201cvariable\u201d\nsets. In this respect (\u221e,\u03c9)-equivalence is an \u201cinvariant\u201d\nnotion of isomorphism.\n3. The Compactness Property\n\n\nAs we have seen, the compactness theorem in its usual form fails for\nall infinitary languages. Nevertheless, it is of some interest to\ndetermine whether infinitary languages satisfy some suitably modified\nversion of the theorem. This so-called compactness problem\nturns out to have a natural connection with purely set-theoretic\nquestions involving \u201clarge\u201d cardinal numbers. \n\n\nWe construct the following definition. Let \u03ba be an infinite\ncardinal. A language L is said to be\n\u03ba-compact (resp. weakly\n\u03ba-compact) if whenever \u0394 is a set of\nL-sentences (resp. a set of\nL-sentences of cardinality \u2264 \u03ba) and each\nsubset of \u0394 of cardinality < \u03ba has a model, so does\n\u0394. Notice that the usual compactness theorem for\n L\n is precisely the assertion that\n L is \u03c9-compact. One reason for\n according significance to the \u03ba-compactness property is the\n following. Call L \u03ba-complete\n (resp. weakly \u03ba-complete) if there is a\n deductive system\nP for L with deductions of\nlength < \u03ba such that, if \u0394 is a\nP-consistent[4]\n set of\nL-sentences (resp. such that |\u0394| \u2264 \u03ba),\nthen \u0394 has a model. Observe that such a\nP will be adequate for deductions from\narbitrary sets of premises (of cardinality \u2264 \u03ba) in the sense\nof \u00a72. It is easily seen that if L is\n\u03ba-complete or weakly \u03ba-complete, then L is\n\u03ba-compact or weakly \u03ba-compact. Thus, if we can show that a\ngiven language is not (weakly) \u03ba-compact, then there can\nbe no deductive system for it with deductions of length < \u03ba\nadequate for deductions from arbitrary sets of premises (of cardinality\n\u2264 \u03ba).\n\n\nIt turns out, in fact, that most languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n fail to be even weakly\n\u03ba-compact, and, for those that are, \u03ba must be an\nexceedingly large cardinal. We shall need some\ndefinitions.\n\n\nAn infinite cardinal \u03ba is said to be weakly\ninaccessible if\n\n\n(a) \u03bb < \u03ba \u2192 \u03bb+ <\n\u03ba, (where \u03bb+ denotes the cardinal successor of\n\u03bb), and \n\n(b) |\u2009I\u2009| < \u03ba and \u03bbi <\n\u03ba (for all i \u2208 I) \u21d2\n\u2211i\u2208I\n\u03bbi < \u03ba.\n\n\n\nIf in addition \n\n\n(c) \u03bb < \u03ba \u21d2 2\u03bb <\n\u03ba,\n\n\n\n\nthen \u03ba is said to be (strongly)inaccessible.\nSince\n \u21350 is inaccessible,\nit is normal practice to confine attention to those inaccessible, or\nweakly inaccessible, cardinals that exceed\n \u21350. Accordingly, inaccessible or weakly\ninaccessible cardinals will always be taken to be uncountable.\nIt is clear that such cardinals\u2014if they exist\u2014must be\nextremely large; and indeed the G\u00f6del incompleteness theorem\nimplies that the existence of even weakly inaccessible cardinals cannot\nbe proved from the usual axioms of set theory. \n\n\nLet us call a cardinal \u03ba compact (resp. weakly\ncompact) if the language\n L(\u03ba,\u03ba)\n is \u03ba-compact (resp. weakly\n\u03ba-compact). Then we have the following results:\n(3.1)\n \u21350\nis compact. This is, of course, just a succinct way of\nexpressing the compactness theorem for first-order languages. \n\n\n\n(3.2) \u03ba is weakly compact \u21d2\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n is weakly\n\u03ba-compact \u21d2 \u03ba is weakly\ninaccessible. Accordingly, it is consistent (with the usual axioms\nof set theory) to assume that no language\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n with \u03ba \u2265 \u03c91\nis weakly \u03ba-compact, or, a fortiori, weakly\n\u03ba-complete.\n\n\n(3.3) Suppose \u03ba is inaccessible. Then \u03ba is weakly\ncompact \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n is weakly\n\u03ba-compact. Also, Also \u03ba is weakly compact \u21d2\nthere is a set of \u03ba inaccessibles before\n\u03ba. Thus a weakly compact inaccessible cardinal is exceedingly\nlarge; in particular it cannot be the first, second, \u2026,\nnth, \u2026 inaccessible.\n\n\n(3.4) \u03ba is compact \u21d2 \u03ba is\ninaccessible. (But, by the result immediately above, the converse\nfails.)\n\n\n\nLet Constr stand for G\u00f6del's axiom of\nconstructibility; recall that Constr is consistent\nwith the usual axioms of set theory. \n(3.5) If Constr holds, then\nthere are no compact cardinals. \n\n\n\n(3.6) Assume Constr and let\n\u03ba be inaccessible. Then \u03ba is weakly\ncompact \u21d4\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is weakly\n\u03ba-compact for all\nL.\n\n\n(3.7) If Constr holds, then there are\nno cardinals \u03ba for which\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9) is compact.\nAccordingly, it is consistent with the usual axioms of set theory to\nsuppose that there is no cardinal \u03ba such that all languages\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) are\n\u03ba-complete. This result is to be contrasted with the fact that\nall first-order languages are \u03c9-complete.\n\n\n\nThe import of these results is that the compactness theorem fails\nvery badly for most languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n with \u03ba \u2265\n\u03c91.\n\n\nSome historical remarks are in order here. In the 1930s\nmathematicians investigated various versions of the so-called\nmeasure problem for sets, a problem which arose in connection\nwith the theory of Lebesgue measure on the continuum. In particular,\nthe following very simple notion of measure was formulated. If\nX is a set, a (countably additive two-valued nontrivial)\nmeasure on X is a map \u03bc on the power set\nPX to the set {0, 1} satisfying:\n(a) \u03bc(X) = 1, \n\n\n\n(b) \u03bc({x}) = \u03bc(\u2205) = 0 for all x\n\u2208X, and\n\n\n(c) if A is any countable family of\nmutually disjoint subsets of X, then\n \u03bc(\u222aA) =\n\u2211{\u03bc(Y) : Y \u2208\nA}.\n\n\n\nObviously, whether a given set supports such a measure depends only\non its cardinality, so it is natural to define a cardinal \u03ba to be\nmeasurable if all sets of cardinality \u03ba support a\nmeasure of this sort. It was quickly realized that a measurable\ncardinal must be inaccessible, but the falsity of the converse was not\nestablished until the 1960s when Tarski showed that measurable\ncardinals are weakly compact and his student Hanf showed that the\nfirst, second, etc. inaccessibles are not weakly compact (cf. (3.3)).\nAlthough the conclusion that measurable cardinals must be monstrously\nlarge is now normally proved without making the detour through weak\ncompactness and infinitary languages, the fact remains that these ideas\nwere used to establish the result in the first instance.\n4. Incompleteness of Infinite-Quantifier Languages\n\n\nProbably the most important result about first-order languages is the\nG\u00f6del completeness theorem which of course says that the\nset of all valid formulas of any first-order language\n L\n can be generated from a simple set\nof axioms by means of a few straightforward rules of inference. A major\nconsequence of this theorem is that, if the formulas of\n L\n are coded as natural numbers in some\nconstructive way, then the set of (codes of) valid sentences is\nrecursively enumerable. Thus, the completeness of a\nfirst-order language implies that the set of its valid sentences is\ndefinable in a particularly simple way. It would accordingly\nseem reasonable, given an arbitrary language\nL, to turn this implication around and suggest that,\nif the set of valid L-sentences is not\ndefinable in some simple fashion, then no meaningful\ncompleteness result can be established for L, or, as\nwe shall say, that L is incomplete. In this\nsection we are going to employ this suggestion in sketching a proof\nthat \u201cmost\u201d infinite quantifier languages are incomplete in\nthis sense. \n\n\nLet us first introduce the formal notion of definability as\nfollows. If L is a language,\nA an L-structure, and\nX a subset of the domain A of\nA, we say that X is definable\nin A by a formula \u03c6(x,\ny1,\u2026,yn) of\nL if there is a sequence\na1,\u2026,an of elements of\nA such that X is the subset of all elements\nx \u2208 A for which \u03c6(x,\na1,\u2026,an) holds in\nA.\n\n\nNow write Val(L) for the set of all the\nvalid L-sentences, i.e., those that hold in\nevery L-structure. In order to assign a meaning to the\nstatement \u201cVal(L) is definable\u201d, we have to\nspecify\n\na structure\nC(L)\u2014the coding\nstructure for L; \na particular one-one map\u2014the coding map\u2014of\nthe set of formulas of L into the domain of\nC(L).\n\n\n\nThen, if we identify Val(L) with its image in\nC(L) under the coding map,\nwe shall interpret the statement \u201cVal(L) is\ndefinable\u201d as the statement \u201cVal(L), regarded\nas a subset of the domain of\nC(L), is definable in\nC(L) by a formula of\nL.\u201d \n\n\nFor example, when L is the first-order\n language\n L of arithmetic, G\u00f6del\noriginally used as coding structure the standard model of\narithmetic \u2115 and as coding map the well-known\nfunction obtained from the prime factorization theorem for natural\nnumbers. The recursive enumerability of\n Val(L)\n then means simply that the set of\ncodes (\u201cG\u00f6del numbers\u201d) of members of\n Val(L) is definable in\n \u2115  by an\n L-formula\n of the form \u2203y\u03c6(x, y), where \u03c6(x,\ny) is a recursive formula.\n\n\nAnother, equivalent, coding structure for the first-order language\nof arithmetic is the structure[5]\n\u27e8H(\u03c9), \u2208 \u2a21  H(\u03c9)\u27e9 of\nhereditarily finite sets, where a set x is\nhereditarily finite if x, its members, its members of\nmembers, etc., are all finite. This coding structure takes account of\nthe fact that first-order formulas are naturally regarded as finite\nsets.\n\n\nTurning now to the case in which L is an infinitary\nlanguage\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb),\nwhat\n would be a suitable coding structure in this case? We remarked at\nthe beginning that infinitary languages were suggested by the\npossibility of thinking of formulas as set-theoretical objects, so let\nus try to obtain our coding structure by thinking about what kind of\nset-theoretical objects we should take infinitary formulas to be. Given\nthe fact that, for each\n\u03c6\u2208Form(\u03ba,\u03bb), \u03c6 and its\nsubformulas, subsubformulas, etc., are all of length <\n\u03ba,[6]\n a moment's reflection reveals that\nformulas of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n\u201ccorrespond\u201d\n to sets x hereditarily of cardinality <\n\u03ba in the sense that x, its members, its members of\nmembers, etc., are all of cardinality < \u03ba. The collection of\nall such sets is written H(\u03ba). H(\u03c9) is\nthe collection of hereditarily finite sets introduced above,\nand H(\u03c91) that of all hereditarily\ncountable sets.\n\n\nFor simplicity let us suppose that the only extralogical symbol of\nthe base language\n L\n is the binary\npredicate symbol \u2208 (the discussion is easily extended to\nthe case in which\n L\n contains\nadditional extralogical symbols). Guided by the remarks above, as\ncoding structure for\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n we take the structure,\nH(\u03ba)\n=df \u27e8H(\u03ba), \u2208 \u2a21\nH(\u03ba)\u27e9.\n\n\nNow we can define the coding map of\nForm(\u03ba,\u03bb) into\n H(\u03ba).\n First, to each basic symbol s\n of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb) we assign a\ncode object\n \u2308s\u2309 \u2208 H(\u03ba) as\nfollows. Let {v\u03be: \u03be < \u03ba} be an\nenumeration of the individual variables of\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb).\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nCode Object\nNotation\n\n\n\u00ac\n1\n\u2308\u00ac\u2309\n\n\n\u2227\n2\n\u2308\u2227\u2309\n\n\n\u2227\n3\n\u2308\u2227\u2309\n\n\n\u2203\n4\n\u2308\u2203\u2309\n\n\n\u2208\n5\n\u2308 \u2208\n\u2309\n\n\n=\n6\n\u2308=\u2309\n\n\nv\u03be\n\u27e80,\u03be\u27e9\n\u2308v\u03be\u2309\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, to each \u03c6 \u2208 Form(\u03ba,\u03bb) we\nassign the code object\n \u2308\u03c6\u2309 recursively as follows: \n\u2308v\u03be =\nv\u03b7\u2309\n\u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308v\u03be\u2309,\n \u2308=\u2309,\n \u2308v\u03b7\u2309\u27e9, \n\n\n\u2308v\u03be\n\u2208 v\u03b7\u2309 \u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308v\u03be\u2309,\n \u2308\u2208\u2309,\n \u2308v\u03b7\u2309\u27e9;\n\n\n\nfor \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Form(\u03ba,\u03bb), \n\u2308\u03c6\n \u2227\n\n \u03c8\u2309 \u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308\u03c6\u2309,\n \u2308\u2227\u2309,\n \u2308\u03c8\u2309\u27e9 \n\n\n\u2308\u00ac\u03c6\u2309 \u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308\u00ac\u2309,\n \u2308\u03c6\u2309\u27e9\n\n\u2308\u2203X\u03c6\u2309 \u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308\u2203\u2309,\n {\u2308x\u2309:\nx \u2208 X},\n \u2308\u03c6\u2309\u27e9;\n\n\n\nand finally if \u03a6 \u2286 Form(\u03ba,\u03bb)\nwith |\u03a6|\n< \u03ba, \n\u2308\u2227\u03a6\u2309 \u00a0=df\u00a0\n \u27e8\u2308\u2227\u2309,\n {\u2308\u03c6\u2309: \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6}\u27e9.\n\n\nThe map \n\u03c6 \u21a6 \u2308\u03c6\u2309 from Form(\u03ba,\u03bb) into\nH(\u03ba) is easily seen to be one-one and is the required\ncoding map. Accordingly, we agree to identify Val(L(\u03ba,\u03bb)) with its image in\nH(\u03ba) under this coding map.\n\n\nWhen is Val(L(\u03ba,\u03bb)) a definable subset of\n H(\u03ba)?\n In order to answer this\nquestion we require the following definitions.\n\n\nAn\n L-formula\n is called a\n\u03940-formula if it is equivalent to a formula\nin which all quantifiers are of the form\n\u2200x\u2208y or \u2203x\u2208y\n(i.e., \u2200x(x\u2208y \u2192 \u2026)\nor \u2203x(x\u2208y\n \u2227\n \u2026)). An\n L-formula\n is a \u03a31-formula if\nit is equivalent to one which can be built up from atomic formulas and\ntheir negations using only the logical operators\n \u2227,\n\n \u2228,\n\u2200x\u2208y, \u2203x. A subset\nX of a set A is said to be \u03940 (resp.\n\u03a31) on A if it is definable in the structure\n\u27e8A, \u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 by a \u03940- (resp.\n\u03a31-) formula of\n L.\n\n\nFor example, if we identify the set of natural numbers with the set\nH(\u03c9) of hereditarily finite sets in the usual way, then\nfor each X \u2286 H(\u03c9) we have:\nX is \u03940 on H(\u03c9)\n\u21d4 X is recursive \n\n\nX is \u03a31 on H(\u03c9) \u21d4\nX is recursively enumerable.\n\n\n\nThus the notions of \u03940- and \u03a31-set\nmay be regarded as generalizations of the notions of recursive\nand recursively enumerable set, respectively. \n\n\nThe completeness theorem for\n L\nimplies\n that Val(L)\n\u2014 regarded as a subset of H(\u03c9) \u2014 is\nrecursively enumerable, and hence \u03a31 on\nH(\u03c9). Similarly, the completeness theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) (see\n\u00a72) implies that Val(L(\u03c91,\u03c9)) \u2014 regarded as a\nsubset of H(\u03c91) \u2014 is\n\u03a31 on H(\u03c91). However, this\npleasant state of affairs collapses completely as soon as\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91) is reached.\nFor one can prove\nScott's Undefinability Theorem for\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91).\nVal(L(\u03c91,\u03c91)) is not\ndefinable in\nH(\u03c91) even by an\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91)-formula;\nhence a fortiori Val(L(\u03c91,\u03c91)) is\nnot \u03a31 on\nH(\u03c91).\n\n\nThis theorem is proved in much the same way as the well-known result\nthat the set of (codes of) valid sentences of the second-order language\nof arithemetic\n L2 is\nnot second-order definable in its coding structure\n \u2115.\n To get this latter result, one first observes that\n \u2115\n is characterized by a single\n L2-sentence, and then shows\nthat, if the result were false, then \u201ctruth in\n \u2115\u201d\n for\n L2-sentences would be definable by an\n L2-formula, thereby\nviolating Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of truth. \n\n\nAccordingly, to prove Scott's undefinability theorem along the above\nlines, one needs to establish:\n\n(4.1) Characterizability of the coding structure\nH(\u03c91)\nin\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91): there is\n an\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-sentence\n\u03c40 such that, for all\n L-structures\n A, A\n \u22a8\n \u03c40 \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\nA\n\u2245\nH(\u03c91).\n\n\n(4.2) Undefinability of truth for\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91)-sentences\nin the coding structure: there is no\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-formula\n\u03c6(v0) such that, for all\n L(\u03c91, \u03c91)-sentences\n\u03c3, H(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n \u03c3\u2194\u03c6(\u2308\u03c3\u2309).\n\n\n(4.3) There is a term t(v0,\nv1) of\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91) such\nthat, for each pair of sentences \u03c3, \u03c4 of\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91),\n H(\u03c91)\n \u00a0\u22a8\u00a0\n [t(\u2308\u03c3\u2309,\u2308\u03c4\u2309)\n =  \u2308\u03c3 \u2192\n \u03c4\u2309].\n\n\n\n(4.1) is proved by analyzing the set-theoretic definition of\n H(\u03c91) and showing\nthat it can be \u201cinternally\u201d formulated in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91). (4.2) is\nestablished in much the same way as Tarski's theorem on the\nundefinability of truth for first- or second-order languages. (4.3) is\nobtained by formalizing the definition of the coding map \u03c3\n \u21a6\n \u2308\u03c3\u2309 in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91). \n\n\nArmed with these facts, we can obtain Scott's undefinability theorem\nin the following way. Suppose it were false; then there would be\n an\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-formula\n\u03b8(v0) such that, for all\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-sentences\n\u03c3,\n(4.4)\n H(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n\n \u03b8(\u2308\u03c3\u2309)\n\u00a0iff \u00a0 \u03c3 \u2208 Val(L(\u03c91,\u03c91)).\n\n\nLet \u03c40 be the sentence given in (4.1). Then we have, for\nall\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-sentences\n\u03c3, \nH(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 \u00a0 iff \u00a0 (\u03c40 \u2192\n\u03c3) \u2208 Val(L(\u03c91,\u03c91)),\n\n\nso that, by (4.4), \nH(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n \u03c3 \u00a0 iff \u00a0\n H(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n\n \u03b8(\u2308\u03c40 \u2192\n \u03c3\u2309).\n\n\nIf t is the term given in (4.3), it would follow that \nH(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n \u03c3\u2194\u03b8(t(\u2308\u03c40\u2309,\n \u2308\u03c3\u2309)).\n\n\nNow write \u03c6(v0) for the\n L(\u03c91,\u03c91)-formula\n\u03b8(t(\u2308\u03c40\u2309,\n \u2308\u03c3\u2309)). Then \nH(\u03c91)\n \u22a8\n\n \u03c3\u2194\u03c6(\u2308\u03c3\u2309),\n\n\ncontradicting (4.2), and completing the proof. \n\n\nThus Val(L(\u03c91,\u03c91)) is not\ndefinable even by an\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91)-formula,\nso a fortiori\nL(\u03c91,\u03c91) is\nincomplete. Similar arguments show that Scott's undefinability theorem\ncontinues to hold when \u03c91 is replaced by any successor\ncardinal \u03ba+; accordingly the languages\n L(\u03ba+,\u03ba+) are all\nincomplete.[7]\n5. Sublanguages of L(\u03c91,\u03c9) and the Barwise Compactness Theorem\n\n\nGiven what we now know about infinitary languages, it would seem\n that\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is\nthe only one to be reasonably well behaved. On the other hand, the\nfailure of the compactness theorem to generalize to\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) in any\nuseful fashion is a severe drawback as far as applications are\nconcerned. Let us attempt to analyze this failure in more detail. \n\n\nRecall from \u00a74 that we may code the formulas of a first-order\nlanguage\n L\n as hereditarily finite\nsets, i.e., as members of H(\u03c9). In that case each finite\nset of (codes of)\n L-sentences\n is\nalso a member of H(\u03c9), and it follows that the\ncompactness theorem for\n L\n can be\nstated in the form:\n(5.1) If \u0394 \u2286 Sent(L) is such that each subset\n\u03940 \u2286 \u0394, \u03940 \u2208\nH(\u03c9) has a model, so does \u0394.\n\n\nNow it is well-known that (5.1) is an immediate consequence of the\ngeneralized completeness theorem for\n L,\n which, stated in a form similar to that of (5.1),\nbecomes the assertion: \n(5.2) If \u0394 \u2286 Sent(L) and \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(L) satisfy\n\u0394\n \u22a8\n \u03c3, then there is a\ndeduction D of \u03c3 from \u0394 such that\nD \u2208\n H(\u03c9).[8]\n\n\nIn \u00a72 we remarked that the compactness theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) fails\nvery strongly; in fact, we constructed a set \u0393 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that \n(5.3) Each countable subset of \u0393 has a model but\n\u0393 does not.\n\n\nRecall also that we introduced the notion of deduction in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9); since\nsuch deductions are of countable length it quickly follows from (5.3)\nthat \n(5.4) There is a\n sentence[9]\u03c3\n \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that\n \u0393\n \u22a8 \u03c3, but there is no\ndeduction of \u03c3 in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) from\n\u0393.\n\n\nNow the formulas of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9) can be coded as members\nof\n H(\u03c91), and it\nis clear that\n H(\u03c91) is closed under the formation of\ncountable subsets and sequences. Accordingly (5.3) and (5.4) may be\nwritten: \n(5.3 bis) Each \u03930 \u2286 \u0393\nsuch that \u03930 \u2208\n H(\u03c91) has a model, but \u0393 does\nnot; \n\n\n\n(5.4 bis) There is a sentence \u03c3 \u2208\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) such that\n \u0393\n \u22a8 \u03c3, but there is no\ndeduction D \u2208\nH(\u03c91) of \u03c3 from \u0393.\n\n\n\nIt follows that (5.1) and (5.2) fail when\n \u201cL\u201d is replaced by\n \u201cL(\u03c91,\u03c9)\u201d and\n \u201cH(\u03c9)\u201d by\n \u201cH(\u03c91)\u201d. Moreover, it can be shown that\nthe set \u0393 \u2286\nSent(\u03c91,\u03c9) in (5.3\nbis) and (5.4 bis) may be taken to be\n\u03a31 on H(\u03c91). Thus the\ncompactness and generalized completeness theorems fail even for\n\u03a31-sets of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9)-sentences. \n\n\nWe see from (5.4 bis) that the reason why the generalized\ncompleteness theorem fails for \u03a31-sets in\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is\nthat, roughly speaking, H(\u03c91) is not \u201cclosed\u201d\nunder the formation of deductions from \u03a31-sets of\nsentences in H(\u03c91). So in order to remedy\nthis it would seem natural to replace H(\u03c91)\nby sets A which are, in some sense, closed under the formation\nof such deductions, and then to consider just those formulas whose\ncodes are in A.\n\n\nWe now give a sketch of how this can be done.\n\n\nFirst, we identify the symbols and formulas of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) with\ntheir codes in H(\u03c91), as in \u00a74. For each\ncountable\n transitive[10]\n set A, let\nLA = Form(L(\u03c91,\u03c9)) \u2229\nA.\n\n\nWe say that\n LA is a sublanguage of\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) if the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied: \n\nL\n \u2286\n LA\nif \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208\n LA, then \u03c6\n \u2227\n \u03c8 \u2208\n LA and \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6 \u2208\n LA and x \u2208 A,\nthen \u2203x\u03c6 \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6(x) \u2208\n LA and y \u2208 A,\nthen \u03c6(y) \u2208\n LA\nif \u03c6 \u2208\n LA, every subformula of \u03c6 is\n in\n LA\nif \u03a6 \u2286\n LA and \u03a6 \u2208 A,\n then\n \u2227\u03a6 \u2208\n LA.\n\n\n\nThe notion of deduction in\n LA is defined in the customary way;\nif \u0394 is a set of sentences of\n LA and \u03c6 \u2208\n LA, then a\ndeduction of \u03c6 from \u0394 in\n LA is a deduction of \u03c6 from\n\u0394 in\n L(\u03c91,\n\u03c9) every formula of which is in\n LA. We say that \u03c6 is\ndeducible from \u0394 in\n LA if there is a deduction\nD of \u03c6 from \u0394 in\n LA; under these\nconditions we write \u0394\n \u22a2A \u03c6. In general,\nD will not be a member of A; in\norder to ensure that such a deduction can be found in A it\nwill be necessary to impose further conditions on A. \n\n\nLet A be a countable transitive set such that\n LA is a\nsublanguage of\n L(\u03c91, \u03c9) and let \u0394 be a set\nof sentences of\n LA. We say that A (or, by\nabuse of terminology,\n LA) is \u0394-closed if,\nfor any formula \u03c6 of\n LA such that \u0394\n \u22a2A \u03c6, there is a\ndeduction D of \u03c6 from \u0394 such that\nD \u2208 A. It can be shown that the\nonly countable language which is \u0394-closed for arbitrary\n\u0394 is the first-order language\n L,\n i.e., when A = H(\u03c9). However\nJ. Barwise discovered that there are countable sets A \u2286\nH(\u03c91) whose corresponding languages\n LA differ\n from\n L and yet are \u0394-closed\nfor all \u03a31-sets of sentences\n\u0394. Such sets A are called admissible sets;\nroughly speaking, they are extensions of the hereditarily finite sets\nin which recursion theory\u2014and hence proof theory\u2014are still\n possible (for the full definition, see Section 5.1 below).\n\n\nFrom Barwise's result one obtains immediately the\nBarwise Compactness Theorem. Let\nA be a countable admissible set and let \u0394 be a set\nof sentences of\nLA which is\n\u03a31 on A. If each \u0394\u2032\n\u2286 \u0394 such that \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a\nmodel, then so does \u0394.\n\n\nThe presence of \u201c\u03a31\u201d here indicates that this theorem\nis a generalization of the compactness theorem for recursively\nenumerable sets of sentences. \n\n\nAnother version of the Barwise compactness theorem, useful for\nconstructing models of set theory, is the following. Let\nZFC be the usual set of axioms for Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory, including the axiom of choice. Then we have:\n5.5 Theorem. Let A be a countable\ntransitive set such that A = \u27e8A,\n\u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 is a model of ZFC.\nIf \u0394 is a set of sentences of\nLA which is\ndefinable in A by a formula of the language of set\ntheory and if each \u0394\u2032 \u2286 \u0394 such\nthat \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a model, so does\n\u0394.\n\n\nTo conclude, we give a simple application of this theorem. Let\nA = \u27e8A, \u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 be\na model of ZFC. A model B =\n\u27e8B, E\u27e9 of ZFC is said to be a\nproper end-extension of A if (i)\nA \u2286 B, (ii)\nA \u2260 B, (iii)\na \u2208 A, b \u2208 B, bEa \u21d2\nb\u2208A. Thus a proper end-extension of a model of\nZFC is a proper extension in which no \u201cnew\u201d element\ncomes \u201cbefore\u201d any \u201cold\u201d element. As our application of\n5.5 we prove \n5.6 Theorem. Each countable\ntransitive model of ZFC has a proper\nend-extension. \n\n\nProof. Let A =\n\u27e8A, \u2208 \u2a21 A\u27e9 be a transitive model of\nZFC and let\n L\n be\nthe first-order language of set theory augmented by a name\na for each a \u2208 A, and an\nadditional constant c. Let \u0394 be the set of\n LA-sentences\ncomprising:\n\nall axioms of ZFC;\nc \u2260 a, for each a\n\u2208 A;\n\u2200x(x \u2208 a\n\u2192\n \u2228b\u2208a x =\nb), for each a \u2208 A;\na \u2208 b, for each\na \u2208 b \u2208 A.\n\n\n\nIt is easily shown that \u0394 is a subset of A which is\ndefinable in A by a formula of the language\nof set theory. Also, each subset \u0394\u2032 \u2286 \u0394 such\nthat \u0394\u2032 \u2208 A has a model. For the set\nC of all a \u2208 A for which\na occurs in \u0394\u2032 belongs to A\n\u2014 since \u0394\u2032 does \u2014 and so, if we interpret\nc as any member of the (necessarily nonempty) set\nA \u2212 C, then A is a model of\n\u0394\u2032. Accordingly, (5.5) implies that \u0394 has a model\n\u27e8B, E\u27e9. If we interpret each constant a\nas the element a \u2208 A, then \u27e8B, E\u27e9\nis a proper end-extension of A. The proof is\ncomplete.\n\n\nThe reader will quickly see that the first-order compactness theorem\nwill not yield this result. \n5.1 Definition of the Concept of Admissible Set\n\n\nA nonempty transitive set A is said to be admissible\nwhen the following conditions are satisfied: \n\nif a, b \u2208 A, then {a, b}\n\u2208 A and \u222aA \u2208 A;\nif a \u2208 A and X \u2286\nA is \u03940 on A, then X \u2229\na \u2208 A;\nif a \u2208 A, X \u2286 A is\n\u03940 on A, and\n\u2200x\u2208a\u2203y(<x,y>\n \u2208  X), then, for some b \u2208 A,\n\u2200x\u2208a\u2203y\u2208b(<x,y>\n\u2208 X).\n\n\n\nCondition (ii) \u2014 the \u03940-separation scheme \u2014\nis a restricted version of Zermelo's axiom of separation. Condition\n(iii) \u2014 a similarly weakened version of the axiom of replacement \u2014\nmay be called the \u03940-replacement scheme. \n\n\nIt is quite easy to see that if A is a transitive set such\nthat <A, \u2208 | A> is a model of\nZFC, then A is admissible. More generally,\nthe result continues to hold when the power set axiom is omitted from\nZFC, so that both H(\u03c9) and\nH(\u03c91) are admissible. However, since the\nlatter is uncountable, the Barwise compactness theorem fails to apply\nto it.\n6. Historical and Bibliographical Remarks\n\n\n\u00a7\u00a71 and 2. Infinitary\npropositional and predicate languages seem to have made their first\nexplicit appearance in print with the papers of Scott and Tarski [1958]\nand Tarski [1958]. The completeness theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9), as well as for other\ninfinitary languages, was proved by Karp [1964]. The Hanf number\ncalculations for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) were first performed by\nMorley [1965]. The nondefinability of well-orderings in\nfinite-quantifier languages was proved by Karp [1965] and Lopez-Escobar\n[1966]. The interpolation theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) was proved by\nLopez-Escobar [1965] and Scott's isomorphism theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) by\nScott [1965]. Negri [2021] extends the idea of geometric logic originating in\ntopos theory to L(\u03c91,\u03c9).\n\n\nKarp's partial isomorphism theorem was first proved in Karp [1965];\nsee also Barwise [1973]. Result (2.2) appears in Chang [1968], result\n(2.3) in Ellentuck [1976] and result (2.4) in Bell [1981].\n\n\n\u00a73. Results (3.2) and (3.3) are due to Hanf\n[1964], with some refinements by Lopez-Escobar [1966] and Dickmann\n[1975], while (3.4) was proved by Tarski. Result (3.5) is due to Scott\n[1961], (3.6) to Bell [1970] and [1972]; and (3.7) to Bell [1974].\nMeasurable cardinals were first considered by Ulam [1930] and Tarski\n[1939]. The fact that measurable cardinals are weakly compact was noted\nin Tarski [1962].\n\n\n\u00a74.  Concerning the undefinability theorem\nfor L(\u03c91,\u03c91).\nCarol Karp remarks (1964, 166), \u201cAt the International Congress\nof Logic, Methodology and the Philosophy of Science at Stanford\nUniversity in 1960, Dana Scott circulated an outline of a proof of the\nimpossibility of a complete definable formal system for (\u03b3+,\n\u03b3+) languages with a single two-place predicate symbol in\naddition to the equality symbol.\u201d Scott never published his\nresult, and a fully detailed proof first appeared in Karp [1964].\nThe approach to the theorem adopted here is based on the account given\nin Dickmann [1975].\n\n\n\u00a75. The original motivation for the results\npresented in this section came from Kreisel; in his [1965] he pointed\nout that there were no compelling grounds for choosing infinitary\nformulas solely on the grounds of \u201clength\u201d, and proposed instead that\ndefinability or \u201cclosure\u201d criteria be employed. Kreisel's suggestion\nwas taken up with great success by Barwise [1967], where his\ncompactness theorem was proved. The notion of admissible set is due to\nPlatek [1966]. Theorem (5.6) is taken from Keisler [1974].\n\n\nFor further reading on the subject of infinitary languages, see Aczel\n[1973], Dickmann [1975], Karp [1964], Keisler [1974], and Makkai\n[1977].  A useful account of the connection between infinitary\nlanguages and large cardinals can be found in Chapter 10 of Drake\n[1974].\n",
