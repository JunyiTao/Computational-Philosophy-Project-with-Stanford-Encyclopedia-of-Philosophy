    "main_text": "Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations || Book of the Elements\n6. Israeli\u2019s Influence on Later Thinkers\n\nIn 956, Dunash Ibn Tamim, a pupil of Isaac Israeli, wrote an extensive\ncommentary on the short recension of Sefer Yetzirah, a\nmystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the\nletters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining\nthe structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so\nextensively that in the nineteenth century, a few scholars\nmisidentified the commentary as Israeli\u2019s.\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s medical treatises were studied for several\ncenturies both in the original Arabic and in Latin translation. In the\neleventh century, Constantine Africanus, a professor at the\nprestigious Salerno school of medicine, translated some of\nIsraeli\u2019s works into Latin. Many medieval Arabic biographical\nchronicles of physicians list him and his works.\n\nIsraeli\u2019s philosophical works exercised a considerable influence\non Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of influence\namong Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, following a major\nphase of the Christian reconquest of Spain, a group of scholars in\nToledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into\nLatin. One of the translators who migrated to this cultural center,\nGerard of Cremona, rendered Israeli\u2019s Book of\nDefinitions and Book on the Elements into Latin.\nIsraeli\u2019s work was quoted and paraphrased by a number of\nChristian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus, Thomas\nAquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and Nicholas of\nCusa (See Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\nxiii\u2013xiv; Julius Guttmann, Die Scholastik des 13.\nJahrhunderts in irhen Beziehungen zum Judentum und zur judische\nLiteratur, pp. 55\u201360, 129\u201330,150 and 172; as well as\nGuttmann, Das Verhaltniss des Thomas von Aquino zum Judentum und\nzur judischen Literatur, pp. 55\u201360).\n\nIsaac Israeli corresponded with Saadya ben Joseph al-Fayyumi\n(882\u2013942) prior to the latter\u2019s departure from Egypt.\nSaadya later became the head (Gaon) of the Talmudic Academy of Sura\nand one of the most influential figures in the medieval Judaism.\nSaadya Gaon was known for his Jewish legal rulings, his arrangement of\nthe Jewish prayer book (Siddur), his translation of the Hebrew Bible\ninto Arabic, his liturgical poetry and his philosophical work The\nBook of Beliefs and Opinions (Arabic: Kitab al-\u2018Amanat\nwal-\u2018Itikadat, Hebrew: Sefer emunot\nve-decot). Altmann and Stern suggest that it is\npossible that Saadya Gaon\u2019s concept of rational commandments was\ninfluenced by Israeli\u2019s concept of \u201cintellectual\nprecepts\u201d from his Book of Definitions. (Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 217) However, it is also possible that Saadya\nGaon\u2019s conception may have been a product of the vibrant and\nsomewhat ecumenical intellectual culture of Baghdad, in which a group\nof theologians known as the Muta\u2018zilites reconciled logic and\nscience with Islamic theology, arguing for the rationality of God and\nHis actions.\n\nThe great Jewish poet and Neoplatonist Solomon Ibn Gabirol (known in\nLatin as Avicebron and Avicebrol) likely read Isaac Israeli\u2019s\nworks as well as the widely-circulated encyclopedic Epistles of\nthe Brethren of Purity (Arabic: Rasa\u2019il Ikhwan\nas-Safa\u2019). Solomon Ibn Gabirol was at times close to the\nlatter in his models of emanation. He was also highly\ninnovative\u2014hence the influence of Isaac Israeli is difficult to\ngauge. Nonetheless, Israeli\u2019s Book on Spirit and Soul\nwas likely the only philosophical text which combined Neoplatonist\ncosmology and psychology with Biblical proof texts\u2014a task which\nIbn Gabirol accomplished so masterfully in his liturgical poem\nKeter Malkhut. It is probable that Ibn Gabirol\u2019s idea\nof spiritual matter was influenced by Israeli.\n\nAnother of the Golden Age Hebrew poets of Spain, Moses Ibn Ezra (c.\n1060\u20131139) quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his\ntreatise The Book of the Garden, explaining the meaning of\nMetaphor and Literal Expression (Originally in Judeo-Arabic:\nKitab al-Hadiqa fi Macna \u2018l-Majaz\nwa\u2019l-Haqiqa). Stern explores this matter in his article\n\u201cIsaac Israeli and Moses ibn Ezra.\u201d The poet and\nphilosopher Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq of Cordoba (d. 1149) authored a work\nThe Microcosm (the Judeo-Arabic original is lost, but the\nwork survived in Hebrew translation as Ha-colam\nha-Qatan) containing many ideas indebted to Israeli. Parallels\nbetween the two thinkers are illuminated in Altmann and Stern\u2019s\nIsaac Israeli (pp. 30, 44, 73\u201374, 117).\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s philosophical influence on Muslim authors is\nslight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli\u2019s philosophy\nin a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic,\nproduced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely\ncirculated in the West under the title Picatrix. Although\nthere are passages which correspond directly to Israeli\u2019s\nwritings, the author does not cite him by name.\n\nAs Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical\ntradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of\nIsaac Israeli diminished as well.\n",
