    "main_text": "\n\nProtagoras (490\u2013420 BCE ca) was one of the most important\nsophists and exerted considerable influence in fifth-century\nintellectual debates. His teaching had a practical and concrete goal,\nand many of the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it\nwas mainly devoted to the development of argumentative techniques. But\nsome of his views also raise important philosophical problems, which\nwere going to be discussed in details by Plato, Aristotle, and many\nother philosophers. His famous thesis according to which \u201cman is\nthe measure of all things\u201d has been interpreted as a first\nstance in favour of relativism, and his claim on the gods introduces\nthe problem of agnosticism. Besides, his conventionalist notion of\njustice marks a break with the traditional account of divine justice;\nas it has been rightly claimed, it also seems to provide a theoretical\nfoundation for democracy based on direct participation. By claiming a\ndirect link with the great poets and thinkers of the past but also by\nappropriating and transforming their tenets, Protagoras presented\nhimself as an heir to Greek paideia, as one of the great\nmasters, or better, as the educator capable of imparting teachings\nsuited to the needs of the new world of the polis.\n",
