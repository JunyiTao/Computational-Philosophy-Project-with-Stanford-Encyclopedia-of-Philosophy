    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation || Membership or Association\n4.3 Membership or Association\n\nRecent decades have witnessed a resurgence of arguments in defense of\nan associative account of political obligation. Associative\nobligations are ones that agents are alleged to have merely in virtue\nof their occupying a role in some socially salient relationship, such\nas being a parent, a friend, or a doctor. These roles are at least\npartly constituted by the various obligations their occupants owe to\nthe other(s) in the relationship; to be X\u2019s parent or Y\u2019s\nfriend just is to have certain duties to X or Y (as well as certain\nclaims against them). Exactly what those obligations are varies\nsomewhat depending on the relationship in question and the society in\nwhich the participants in that relationship are embedded. These\nvariations reflect different conceptions of the relationship\u2019s\nvalue or purpose, or of the particular obligations that follow from a\nspecific conception. Whatever their number and content, associative\nobligations are owed only to particular others, namely those with whom\nan agent has a certain kind of relationship, rather than being owed\nuniversally to all moral agents or sentient beings in virtue of their\nstatus as such.\n\nSince associative obligations attach to an agent simply in virtue of\nher occupying a role in a particular relationship, it makes no\ndifference whether she comes to occupy that role voluntarily, as in\nthe case of professional relationships and most friendships, or\nnon-voluntarily, as in the case of sibling relationships or, in many\ncases, citizenship. As these examples suggest, occupying roles in\nvarious types of relationships often figures centrally in\npeople\u2019s identity. In part, this is a matter of people\u2019s\nself-conception; many of us strongly identify with our role as\nparents, children, siblings, friends, teachers, members of specific\nreligious communities, and so on. Some proponents of associative\nobligations advance a stronger claim, however. Human beings are not\nessentially unencumbered individuals who can move in and out of\nvarious roles while remaining the same person; rather, we are all\nembedded in a web of normative relationships, some of which we cannot\nexit without being \u201creborn\u201d as radically different\npeople.\n\nAn associative account of political obligation has many attractive\nfeatures. It provides a justification for a duty to obey the law that\ndoes not depend on an individual\u2019s choice or voluntary exercise\nof will \u2013 surely a virtue when so many people have not consented\nto be ruled by the state that governs them, or to be a member of the\npolitical community on whose behalf it does so. The particularity of\npolitical obligation \u2013 again, the fact that it is owed to the\nparticular political community to which an agent belongs \u2013\nfollows straightforwardly from its nature as an associative\nobligation. So, too, does the claim that political obligation requires\nobedience to law. As Samuel Scheffler observes,\n\u201cmembership-dependent reasons are reasons for doing one\u2019s\nshare, as defined by the norms and ideals of the group itself, to help\nsustain it and contribute to its purposes\u201d (2018, p. 17). Law\nspecifies, perhaps incompletely, what counts as doing one\u2019s\nshare. John Horton makes the same point when he writes that laws\n\u201cdefine the terms of association within a polity, [and] concern\nfor the interests and welfare of the polity is a concern for these\nterms of association\u201d (1992, p. 165). Finally, many people\napparently think of themselves as members of political societies, and\nin virtue of that fact, believe that they have an obligation to obey\nits laws. To pay one\u2019s taxes, to vote, to serve on a jury or in\nthe armed forces, to coordinate with other members of one\u2019s\npolity to ensure a safe environment, and so on, is simply to fulfill\nthe obligations of citizenship. An associative account of political\nobligation captures this (allegedly) widespread sense that \u201cdeep\nand important obligations flow from identity and relatedness\u201d\n(Tamir 1993, p. 99).\n\nLike the other theories of political obligation, associative accounts\nhave met with considerable criticism. One line of attack targets the\nparallels many of its proponents draw between the family and the\npolity. In Ronald Dworkin\u2019s words, \u201cpolitical association,\nlike family and friendship and other forms of association more local\nand intimate, is in itself pregnant of obligation\u201d (1986, p.\n206). John Horton invokes further analogs between family and polity in\nhis argument for associative political obligation:\n\n\nMy claim is that a polity is, like the family, a relationship into\nwhich we are mostly born, and that the obligations which are\nconstitutive of the relationship do not stand in need of moral\njustification in terms of a set of basic moral principles or some\ncomprehensive moral theory. Furthermore, both the family and the\npolitical community figure prominently in our sense of who we are: our\nself-identity and our understanding of our place in the world (1992,\npp. 150\u201351).\n\n\nWhile some critics contest the existence of associative obligations\neven among family members (Wellman 1997), others acknowledge their\nexistence but maintain that they depend on a degree of intimacy and\nemotional connection absent from the relationship between citizens of\na modern state. As Diane Jeske writes: \u201c[A]ll of the features of\nintimate relationships that seem morally significant \u2013 the\nmutual emotions and attitudes of the parties to each other as\nindividuals, the personal interaction, the mutual knowledge and\nunderstanding of each other\u2019s character \u2013 must be ignored\nin the grounding of associative [political] obligations. [I]f the\nrelationships that ground associative obligations are to include\npolitical relations, the notion of a relationship has to be stretched\nbeyond recognition\u201d (2001, p. 38; see also Simmons 1996; Wellman\n1997; Dagger 2000). Advocates of associative political obligation\noffer two (complementary) responses. First, some contend that citizens\nof modern states can and do care for their fellow citizens and the\nhealth of their common political community, even if their\nrelationships with one another do not approximate the intimacy we find\nin a (healthy) nuclear family. The concern for one\u2019s polity, and\nits present, past, and future members, reflects the special\nrelationship one bears to them, and therefore differs from the concern\na person may have for all moral agents or sentient beings as such.\nSecond, we should not assume that a relationship must be characterized\nby intimacy or specific types of emotional connection in order to have\nthe sort of value that can justify associative obligations (Horton and\nWindeknecht 2015, p. 907, Scheffler 2018, p. 10). Even if intimacy is\na necessary condition for realizing the good of friendship, and love a\nnecessary condition for realizing the non-instrumental value of the\nparent-child relationship, it does not follow that they are necessary\nfor achieving the (non-instrumental) value of political\nassociation.\n\nNevertheless, defenders of an associative account of political\nobligation owe their interlocutors an account of what makes political\nassociation valuable. The emphasis these theorists have placed on\nmembership or association as the ground of political obligation,\nwhilst giving relatively little attention to what makes it valuable,\nhas invited the following objection: if membership is sufficient to\ngenerate an obligation to obey, then the members of unjust and\nexploitative groups will have an obligation to obey the rules. In the\ncase of the polity, this leads to the unpalatable and\ncounter-intuitive conclusion that the routinely exploited and\noppressed \u201cmembers\u201d of an unjust polity are under an\nobligation to obey its laws (Dagger 2000; 2018, p. 89).\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to deny that unjust associations have the\nsort of value that can ground associative obligations, or at least\nthat this is so for those \u201cmembers\u201d who are routinely\nexploited and oppressed. Thus, John Horton develops a two-pronged\naccount of associative political obligation according to which a\npolity must provide its citizens \u201cthe generic good of order\nand security\u201d and its members must identify with it and\nacknowledge its political authority (Horton 2010). Similarly,\nScheffler maintains that \u201cthe value of one\u2019s membership is\nnot independent of the nature of the society or the justice of its\ninstitutions,\u201d (2018, p. 14) while Ronald Dworkin holds that\nassociative political obligations arise only among members of a\ncommunity of principle, one committed to the treatment of all its\nmembers with equal concern and respect (1986, pp. 213\u2013215).\nWhereas these rejoinders all make associative political obligations\nconditional on the polity adequately satisfying certain substantive\nmoral standards, Massimo Renzo sketches a response that focuses\ninstead on what makes a person a member of a political society. His\nanswer is a \u201cquasi-voluntarist reformulation of the associative\nmodel\u201d which holds that we voluntarily occupy our roles even in\nfamilies and polities as long as \u201cwe could have stepped out of\nthem if we had wanted\u201d (2012, p. 109, p. 120). Oppressed\n\u201cmembers\u201d of a polity have no associative obligations, at\nleast if stepping out of their role as \u201cmembers\u201d is not an\noption available to them at a reasonable cost.\n\nCritics maintain that in offering responses like those just described,\nassociative theorists effectively abandon their attempt to provide a\ndistinctive account of political obligation (Dagger 2018, p.\n79\u201382; Wellman 2000, p. 553; Simmons 2001, pp. 83\u201384;\n2005, pp. 111\u2013115). That is because the moral duty to perform\nthe (conventional) duties that constitute the role of citizen\nultimately depends either on an agent\u2019s exercise of will, i.e.\nconsent or accepting the benefits of others\u2019 cooperation, or a\nnatural duty, such as the duty to support just institutions or the\nduty to maximize aggregate welfare. In all of these cases,\ncitizens\u2019 duty to obey the law ultimately depends on a\nconsideration other than their membership in the polity. The task of\nmorally justifying political obligation bottoms out not in the fact of\nassociation but in a moral principle external to it.\n\nSome associative theorists respond that the critics conflate\nconsiderations that disable associative obligations with\nconsiderations that ground or justify associative obligations (Horton\nand Windeknecht 2015, p. 914; Scheffler 2018, p. 11). For instance, it\nmay be that the freedom to exit a relationship is a necessary\ncondition for it being one that has the sort of value that justifies\nobligations on the part of those who participate in it. Awareness of\nthe impossibility of exit may lead a person to feel alienated from\ntheir role in the relationship, or otherwise preclude it from being\none that is valuable for that person. Yet it is the good realized in\nthe relationship that justifies participants\u2019 claims against one\nanother, and the duties to which they correlate, not any consent\nimplicit in their continued participation in it.\n\nAnother rejoinder starts from the observation that actual associations\nbetween family, friends, and fellow citizens are typically\napproximations of moralized ideal types. That is,\nconsiderations of fairness, respect, care, and reliance are part and\nparcel of our concepts of parent, sibling, friend, and citizen. Thus,\nthe invocation of unfairness, disrespect, or neglect to rebut the\nclaim that one has a duty to \u00d8 because one occupies the role of\nsibling or citizen need not involve an appeal to some moral principle\nexternal to the relationship. Instead, it may involve an appeal to a\nprinciple internal to the relationship; that is, to a\nmoralized conception of what it is to be a sibling or citizen. This\nline of argument entails that obligation-generating associations exist\nonly where they realize the relevant ideal-type to a sufficient\ndegree; all genuine associations or relationships are, necessarily,\ngood or valuable associations. Thus, an associative theorist who\nadopts this line of argument has a ready response to the allegation\nthat she is committed to the conclusion that exploited or oppressed\ncitizens have a duty to obey the law: since they have no genuine\npolitical association or common citizenship with their oppressors,\nthey have none of the duties that flow from such a relationship when\nit exists.\n\nA last response holds that freedom, equality, fairness, and so on are\nnot abstract principles from which we can derive the existence or\nnon-existence of political obligation; rather, they are regulative\nideals to which (a sufficient number of) participants in genuine\npolitical communities are committed, despite their many differences on\npoints of detail large and small. There is no vantage point outside\nthe specific, historical, political communities in which we are\ninevitably situated, from which we can identify the true bases of our\nmoral obligations and so determine whether we have a moral duty to\nobey the law. Thus, there is no abstract, universal, moral principle\nof fairness, utility, respect for autonomy, etc., that provides a firm\nfoundation for associative obligations, or at least not one to which\nwe have any access. Rather, there are only the concrete practices of\nfairness, welfare-promotion, and so on realized in actual polities.\n\u201cPolitical obligations are practical commitments that come into\nplay through participants\u2019 mutually holding each other to\naccount in political practices,\u201d (Fossen 2014, p. 231) not\ntruths derived from more basic principles comprehended via an act of\nintellect.\n",
