    "main_text": "The Formalism: A Concise Sketch\n2. The Formalism: A Concise Sketch\n\nLet us recall the axiomatic structure of quantum theory: \n\n\n\nStates of physical systems are associated with normalized vectors in a\nHilbert space, a complex, infinite-dimensional, complete and separable\nlinear vector space equipped with a scalar product. Linearity implies\nthat the superposition principle holds: if \\(\\ket{f}\\) is a state and\n\\(\\ket{g}\\) is a state, then (for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) arbitrary complex\nnumbers) also \n\n\\[\n\\ket{K} = a\\ket{f} + b\\ket{g}\n\\]\n\n\nis a state. Moreover, the state evolution is linear, i.e., it\npreserves superpositions: if \\(\\ket{f,t}\\) and \\(\\ket{g,t}\\) are the\nstates obtained by evolving the states \\(\\ket{f,0}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{g,0}\\), respectively, from the initial time \\(t=0\\) to the time\n\\(t\\), then \\(a\\ket{f,t} + b\\ket{g,t}\\) is the state obtained by the\nevolution of \\(a\\ket{f,0} + b\\ket{g,0}\\). Finally, the completeness\nassumption is made, i.e., that the knowledge of its statevector\nrepresents, in principle, the most accurate information one can have\nabout the state of an individual physical system.\n\n\nObservable quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators \\(B\\)\non the Hilbert space containing the possible states of the system. The\nassociated eigenvalue equations \\(B\\ket{b_k} = b_k \\ket{b_k}\\) and the\ncorresponding eigenmanifolds (the linear manifolds spanned by the\neigenvectors associated to a given eigenvalue, also called\neigenspaces) play a basic role for the predictive content of the\ntheory. In fact:\n\nThe eigenvalues \\(b_k\\) of an operator \\(B\\) represent the only\npossible outcomes in a measurement of the corresponding\nobservable.\nThe square of the norm (i.e., the length) of the projection of the\nnormalized statevector (i.e., of length 1) describing the state of the\nsystem onto the eigenmanifold associated to a given eigenvalue gives\nthe probability of obtaining the corresponding eigenvalue as the\noutcome of the measurement of that observable. In particular, it is\nuseful to recall that when one is interested in the probability of\nfinding a particle at a given place, one has to resort to the\nso-called configuration space representation of the statevector. In\nsuch a case the statevector becomes a square-integrable function of\nthe position variables of the particles of the system, whose square\nmodulus yields the probability density for the possible outcomes of\nposition measurements.\n\n\n\nWe stress that, according to the above scheme, quantum mechanics makes\nonly conditional probabilistic predictions (conditional on the\nmeasurement being actually performed) for the outcomes of prospective\n(and in general incompatible among themselves) measurement processes.\nOnly if a state belongs to an eigenmanifold of the observable, which\nis going to be measured, already before the act of measurement, one\ncan predict the outcome with certainty. In all other cases\u2014if\nthe completeness assumption is made\u2014one has objective\nnonepistemic probabilities for different outcomes.\n\nThe orthodox position gives a very simple answer to the question: what\ndetermines the outcome, when different outcomes are possible? The\nanswer is \u201cnothing\u201d\u2014the theory is complete and\ntherefore it is illegitimate to raise any question about properties\npossessed prior to a measurement, when different outcomes of a\nmeasurement of an observable have non-vanishing probabilities of\noccurring, if the measurement is actually performed. Correspondingly,\nthe referents of the theory are only the results of measurements.\nThese are to be described in classical terms and involve in general\nmutually exclusive physical conditions.\n\nRegarding the legitimacy of attributing properties to physical\nsystems, one could say that quantum mechanics warns us against\nattributing too many properties to physical systems.\nHowever\u2014with Einstein\u2014one can adopt a sufficient condition\nfor the existence of an objective individual property the possibility\nto predict with certainty the outcome of a measurement. This implies\nthat, whenever the overall statevector factorizes into the state of\nthe Hilbert space of the physical system \\(S\\) times the state for the\nrest of the universe, \\(S\\) does possess some properties (actually a\ncomplete set of properties, i.e., those associated to appropriate\nmaximal sets of commuting observables).\n\nBefore concluding this section some comments about the measurement\nprocess are of relevance. Quantum theory was created to describe the\nbehavior of microscopic phenomena as was emerging from observations.\nIn order to obtain information about system at the molecular and\n(sub-) atomic scale, one must be able to establish strict correlations\nbetween the states of the microscopic system and the states of the\nmeasuring devices, which we directly perceive. Within the formalism,\nthis is described by considering appropriate micro-macro interactions.\nThe fact that when the measurement is completed one can make\nstatements about the outcome is accounted for by the already mentioned\nWPR postulate (Dirac 1935): a measurement always causes a system\nto jump in an eigenstate of the observed quantity.\nCorrespondingly, also the statevector of the apparatus\n\u2018jumps\u2019 into the manifold associated to the recorded\noutcome.\n",
