    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism, Mathematics || Limit and the Unlimited\n4.1 Limit and the Unlimited\n\nAs we have seen, Iamblichus posited at the top of his system, below\nthe One but above the Intelligible\u2014and thus at a supra-essential\nlevel\u2014the dual principles of Limit (peras) and the\nUnlimited (or Infinite: apeiron). These principles belong to\nthe Pythagorean tradition (see, e.g., Philolaus Fr. 1 Huffman and\nNicomachus, Introduction to Arithmetic II, 18, 4), although\nthe main catalysts responsible for their integration into the\nNeoplatonic system were two indirect accounts, Plato\u2019s\nPhilebus (see above,\n Section 3.1)\n and Aristotle, Metaphysics \u0391, 5 (987a15\u201319):\n\n\n(the Pythagoreans) thought that finitude and infinity were not\nattributes of certain other things, e.g., of fire or earth or anything\nelse of this kind, but that infinity itself and unity itself were the\nsubstance of the things of which they are predicated (trans.\nRoss).\n\n\nCloser to Iamblichus, one must also mention the precedent of Eudorus\nof Alexandria (apud Simplicius, In Phys.\n118.22\u201328), as well as Plotinus\u2019 acknowledgment of\nsomething apeiron within the Intellect (Ennead II, 4\n[12]).\n\nThe importance of this Pythagoreanizing slant can hardly be\noverstated. In agreement with Iamblichus\u2019 vertical conception of\nreality, it means that everything below this dyad is to be regarded as\na mix of determination and indetermination: and this includes gods, as\nwell as Forms such as those contained within the Model, some of which\nare claimed to partake in movement and alterity (see In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 46]), while less elaborate versions of\nPlatonism would rather view them as solely determinate, viz.\nthinkable. In a text from Simplicius\u2019 commentary on the\nCategories (135.10\u201316 [DL-1972: Fr. 37]), the\nproductive capacity of the One appears to reflect these two\ndimensions:\n\n\nSince the power of the One, from which all quantity is generated, is\nextended unchanged \u2026 and gives definition to each thing as it\nproceeds from itself, in that it pervades the whole in an entirely\nundivided manner, it brings the continuous into being, by making its\nprogression single and uninterrupted \u2026: but in that it comes to\na halt in its progression at each of the forms and defines each\n\u2026 it brings about the discrete (trans. Fleet).\n\n\nConsequently, Iamblichus came to the conclusion that all things\npartake in opposition, a phenomenon most conspicuous in the sublunary\nworld, as the philosopher notes in the context of an allegorical\nexegesis of the prologue to Plato\u2019s Timaeus (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 10]). Thus, it appears that\nIamblichus\u2019 goal in introducing the Limit\u2013Unlimited pair\nwas to account for the genesis of multiplicity and alterity, Limit\nproviding definition and intelligibility, while the Unlimited enables\ninfinite flux and iteration within all individual items partaking of\nthe same form: this interpretation is, at any rate, in line with the\nepit\u0113deiot\u0113s or \u201creceptivity\u201d axiom\n(see\n Section 3.5\n above), which states that the effect receives the causal influx\naccording to what it is itself, and thus always imperfectly. This may\nbe seen as Iamblichus\u2019 equivalent of Plotinus\u2019\nintellectual vitalism (the notion that the intelligible world is\nintrinsically active, being Life itself): it allows for considerable\nmetaphysical dynamism. To be sure, Limit retains axiological\nprecedence over the Unlimited, but indetermination can no longer be\nconceived of as a mere by-product of matter\u2019s resistance to\nform. Rather, while it is true that higher principles are more\ncharacterized by Limit and lower ones by the Unlimited, each and every\nthing reflects, to some extent, both of these principles.\n",
