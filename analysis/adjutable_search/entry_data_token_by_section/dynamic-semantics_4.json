    "main_text": "Interpretation as a Process || The notion of context in dynamic semantics\n1.4 The notion of context in dynamic semantics\n\nInformation states are often called contexts, since the state\nis a precondition for the \u201cinterpretation\u201d, i.e., semantic\nevaluation, of expressions in a formal or natural language. The use of\nthe word \u201ccontext\u201d also makes it clear that we are not\ninterested in the total state of the receiver but only in aspects of\nit relevant to the interpretation of the expressions/informational\nitems we are focusing on. Thus, meanings are often called context\nchange potentials in the dynamic tradition.\n\nAlthough it is broadly speaking true that the changes brought about by\nmeanings in dynamic semantics concern aspects of context, it\nis important to note that semanticists may mean various things when\nthey talk about context (compare the entries on\n epistemic contextualism\n and\n indexicals),\n and these different views engender varieties of dynamic semantics\nthat deal with a variety of issues. Some of these issues are:\nconstructing an appropriate mechanism for pronominal reference\n(compare the entries on\n anaphora\n and\n reference),\n explaining the semantics of conditionals (compare the entries on\n conditionals\n and\n the logic of conditionals),\n giving a semantic treatment of the distinction between assertion and\npresupposition (compare the entries on\n assertion,\n speech acts,\n implicature,\n pragmatics) and developing a theory of \u201cpresupposition\nprojection\u201d, explaining how the interpretation of discourse is\ninfluenced and guided by the common ground that exists between speaker\nand hearer, and developing a theory of how this common ground develops\nas the discourse proceeds (compare the entries on\n pragmatics\n and\n implicature).\n\nContext plays a role in two separate distinctions. The first\ndistinction is between context and that which modifies the context.\nHere the context is the information state or a suitable abstraction\nthereof (compare the entry on\n semantic conceptions of information).\n The context modifier is (the meaning of) the received informational\nitem. The information cannot be received without the correct kind of\npresupposed information state. The proper analogues in classical\nstatic predicate logic (compare the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory)\n are as follows: the information state is an assignment (environment)\nor a set of assignments, and the received information is a set of\nassignments. The second distinction is between context and content.\nHere the context is something like the storage capacity of the\nreceiver and various other features that could influence how new\nexpressions/informational items are interpreted. The content is the\n(factual, truth conditional) information that is stored. Thus, e.g.,\nthe context in this sense could be a set of registers/variables or in\nDRT/FCS terms, discourse referents or files. The content would then be\nsome set of assignments or, perhaps, world/assignment pairs\nconstraining the values of these discourse referents and the set of\nworlds that are live candidates for the actual world.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate the distinctions. Suppose we view an\ninformation state as a pair of a finite set of discourse referents and\na set of world/assignment pairs, where the assignments have as domain\nthe given finite set of discourse referents. Such a state would be a\ncontext-in-the-first-sense and the set of discourse referents would be\na context-in-the-second-sense. One basic kind of update would be\nupdate of content: here we constrain the set of world/assignment\npairs, and leave the set of referents constant. A second basic kind of\nupdate would be extension of the set of referents: we extend our\nallocated storage capacity. We modify the given world/assignments\npairs to pairs of worlds and extended assignments, where our extended\nassignments are constrained by the old ones, but take all possible\nvalues on the new referents. Thus, the update process in our example\nis two-dimensional: we have both update of content and update of\ncontext-in-the-second-sense.\n",
