    "main_text": "\n\nHuman beings value their privacy and the protection of their personal\nsphere of life. They value some control over who knows what about\nthem. They certainly do not want their personal information to be\naccessible to just anyone at any time. But recent advances in\ninformation technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount of\ncontrol over personal data and open up the possibility of a range of\nnegative consequences as a result of access to personal data. In the\nsecond half of the 20th century data protection regimes\nhave been put in place as a response to increasing levels of\nprocessing of personal data. The 21st century has become\nthe century of big data and advanced information technology (e.g.\nforms of deep learning), the rise of big tech companies and the\nplatform economy, which comes with the storage and processing of\nexabytes of data.\n\nThe revelations of Edward Snowden, and more recently the Cambridge\nAnalytica case (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison 2018) have\ndemonstrated that worries about negative consequences are real. The\ntechnical capabilities to collect, store and search large quantities\nof data concerning telephone conversations, internet searches and\nelectronic payment are now in place and are routinely used by\ngovernment agencies and corporate actors alike. The rise of China and\nthe large scale of use and spread of advanced digital technologies for\nsurveillance and control have only added to the concern of many. For\nbusiness firms, personal data about customers and potential customers\nare now also a key asset. The scope and purpose of the personal data\ncentred business models of Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Facebook,\nMicrosoft, Apple) has been described in detail by Shoshana Zuboff\n(2018) under the label \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. \n\nAt the same time, the meaning and value of privacy remains the subject\nof considerable controversy. The combination of increasing power of\nnew technology and the declining clarity and agreement on privacy give\nrise to problems concerning law, policy and ethics. Many of these\nconceptual debates and issues are situated in the context of\ninterpretation and analysis of the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR) that was adopted by the EU in spring 2018 as the successor of\nthe EU 1995 Directives, with application far beyond the borders of the\nEuropean Union.\n\nThe focus of this article is on exploring the relationship between\ninformation technology and privacy. We will both illustrate the\nspecific threats that IT and innovations in IT pose for privacy and\nindicate how IT itself might be able to overcome these\nprivacy concerns by being developed in ways that can be termed\n\u201cprivacy-sensitive\u201d, \u201cprivacy enhancing\u201d or \u201cprivacy\nrespecting\u201d. We will also discuss the role of emerging technologies\nin the debate, and account for the way in which moral debates are\nthemselves affected by IT.\n",
