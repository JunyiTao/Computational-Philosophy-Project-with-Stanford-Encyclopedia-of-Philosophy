Marxist-Feminist Analyses\n\nMany Marxist-feminists thinkers, prominent among them sociologists and\nanthropologists, have done cross-cultural and historical studies of\nearlier forms of kinship and economy and the role of the sexual or\ngender division of labor in supporting or undermining women\u2019s\nsocial power (cf. Reed 1973, Leacock 1972, Rosaldo and Lamphere 1974).\nThey have also attempted to assess the world economic development of\ncapitalism as a contradictory force for the liberation of women\n(Federici 2004; Mies 1986; Saffioti 1978) and to argue that universal\nwomen\u2019s liberation requires attention to the worse off: poor\nwomen workers in poor post-colonial countries (Sen & Grown 1987).\nOther feminist anthropologists have argued that other variables in\naddition to women\u2019s role in production are key to understanding\nwomen\u2019s social status and power (Sanday 1981; Leghorn and Parker\n1981). Yet other feminist economic historians have done historical\nstudies of the ways that race, class and ethnicity have situated women\ndifferently in relation to production, for example in the history of\nthe United States (Davis 1983; Amott and Matthaei 1991). Finally some\nMarxist-feminists have argued that women\u2019s work in biological\nand social reproduction is a necessary element of all modes of\nproduction and one often ignored by Marxist economists (Benston 1969;\nHennessy 2003; Vogel 1995).\n",
