    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nJohn von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern laid the foundations of\nclassical game theory in their treatise Theory of Games and\nEconomic Behavior (von Neumann & Morgenstern 1944). Following\na series of refinements published in the 1950s by numerous theorists,\nmost notably John Nash, game theory then transformed social science\nover the course of the next several decades. Noncooperative game\ntheory, the more fundamental branch of game theory, explores\nscenarios where the results of an agent\u2019s actions depend upon\nwhat other agents do, and where agents lack external mechanisms for\nenforcing agreements. More precisely, it provides a model of how\nagents satisfying certain criteria of rationality interact in\ngames characterized by the actions or\nstrategies available to each of the agents and the\npayoffs they can achieve. Payoffs in such scenarios are a\nproduct of the joint strategy profile that is defined by the\nactions independently chosen by the respective agents and the\nstate of the world that obtains which reflects aspects of the\ngame that are variable and over which no agent has control. Many\nscenarios in noncooperative game theory can be fruitfully analyzed\nusing ordinal preferences constructed from agents\u2019\nrankings of possible outcomes. However, von Neumann and Morgenstern\nalso introduced a theory of cardinal utility that provides a\nmore precise account of payoffs by using agents\u2019 preferences\nover lotteries to reflect how much agents prefer one outcome to\nanother. Utilizing this framework, a more varied set of solution\nconcepts was developed to predict how games would be played, and to\ndetermine when individual agents are employing optimal strategies and\nwhat the consequences of this are for the set of all agents.\n\nOne of the most widely utilized solution concepts is the Nash\nequilibrium. Based upon the Bayesian rationality\ncriterion according to which one chooses so as to maximize her\nexpected utility, a Nash equilibrium is a profile of strategies\nadopted by a set of agents in which the strategy adopted by each agent\nmaximizes her respective payoff given the probabilistically\nindependent strategies adopted by other agents. In other words, at a\nNash equilibrium each agent\u2019s strategy is a best response to the\nothers\u2019 strategies, so that none can do better by acting\ndifferently given what others are doing. Although Nash was not the\nfirst to introduce this equilibrium concept, its broad applicability\nwas recognized only after Nash refined the concept and proved that if\na noncooperative game has finitely many pure strategy profiles, then\nat least one Nash equilibrium always exists. Prior to Nash\u2019s\nproof it was widely known that many games lack a Nash equilibrium in\npure strategies where each agent optimally responds to what\nevery other agent does by adopting one of the actions available to\nher. This initially limited the class of problems to which the concept\ncould be applied, but Nash showed that in such cases there will always\nbe a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies were each agent\noptimally responds to what other agents do by choosing among a subset\nof the strategies available to her with some probability. The\nusefulness of this concept would then be further extended by\nsubsequent refinements, including most notably those made by John\nHarsanyi and Reinhard Selten (see, e.g., Harsanyi & Selten\n1988).\n\nIn addition to his work refining solution concepts in noncooperative\ngame theory Nash also made important contributions to cooperative\ngame theory, an approach to modeling strategic interactions that\nextends things by allowing for the possibility that agents can be\nconstrained by binding agreements. Among other things, cooperative\ngame theory provides a set of tools for analyzing questions related to\ncoalition building, as well as problems that arise in contexts where\nagents can rely on external authorities to enforce agreements.\nNash\u2019s most important contribution here was to introduce two\napproaches to analyzing the bargaining problem. This problem\nhas been important in contractarian approaches to justifying moral and\npolitical orders, a subject we\u2019ll return to in\n section 4.\n\nA third approach to using game theoretic tools to model social\ninteractions explores how boundedly rational agents might\nachieve certain outcomes as a result of inductive learning or\nthe presence of focal points. The inductive learning aspect\nof this approach is known as\n evolutionary game theory,\n so-called because much of the early work on inductive learning was\napplied to the question of why various biological traits or behavioral\npatterns emerge in particular populations. John Maynard Smith\u2019s\nEvolution and the Theory of Games (1982) is an early classic\nin this tradition, while subsequent work by anthropologists,\neconomists, and political scientists would apply this approach to\nproblems of interest to social and political philosophers, including\nespecially how cooperation can be sustained in large groups. Where\nmuch of the foundational work on inductive learning was done by\nbiologists, much of the early work on focal points was done by\neconomists, with Thomas Schelling\u2019s book The Strategy of\nConflict (1960) being particularly influential. Roughly speaking,\nfocal points are actions or outcomes that are likely to be\nsalient (Lewis 1969: 35\u201336) in the sense that they\n\u201cstand out\u201d to the agents involved in a game. As Schelling\nshowed, such points are especially important in games where the\nstrategy space is large and/or there are many potential\nequilibria.\n\nRichard Braithwaite was the first professional philosopher to formally\nemploy game theory in the analysis of a problem of ethics. In his 1954\nlecture Theory of Games as a Tool for the Moral Philosopher\n(published 1955), Braithwaite used Nash\u2019s bargaining problem to\nargue for a particular resolution to the fair division\nproblem. He also conjectured that game theory might transform moral\nphilosophy, much as statistics had transformed the social sciences.\nAlthough this transformation has not taken place in philosophy in the\nway that it has for some of the other social sciences, game theory has\nmade significant inroads into moral and political philosophy in the\nyears since Braithwaite\u2019s lecture. David Gauthier\u2019s\nMorals by Agreement (1986) and Ken Binmore\u2019s Game\nTheory and the Social Contract (2 volumes, 1994, 1998) are\narguably the first two works to present systematic moral theories\nbuilt from game-theoretic foundations. Gauthier\u2019s theory is\nrooted in classical game theory, although he proposes revisions to the\northodox account of Bayesian rationality that classical theory\ntypically assumes. Binmore\u2019s theory, on the other hand,\nintegrates elements of both evolutionary and classical game theory.\nOther significant uses of game theory in ethics include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\nanalyses of social conventions as equilibria of games predicated\nupon common knowledge (Lewis 1969; Vanderschraaf 2019);\nanalyses of social norms (Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Basu 2000;\nBicchieri 2006, 2017; Brennan, Eriksson, Goodin & Southwood\n2013);\nexplanations of elements of social contracts in terms of\nevolutionary game theory (Sugden 1986; Skyrms 1996); and\napplications of Nash\u2019s bargaining theory in alternative\nsocial contract theories (Gaus 2010; Muldoon 2016; Moehler 2018;\nVanderschraaf 2019).\n\n\nFurthermore, although the formal frameworks associated with game\ntheory did not emerge until the mid-twentieth century, it\u2019s now\nwidely recognized that the work of many earlier philosophers are\namenable to game theoretic analysis, and that, in many cases, these\nworks clearly anticipated important developments in game theory. For\ninstance, Barry (1965), Gauthier (1969), Hampton (1986), Kavka (1986),\nand Taylor (1987) provide game-theoretic characterizations of\nHobbes\u2019 arguments for the inevitability of war in the State of\nNature and for the benefit of establishing a sovereign. Indeed, this\nbranch of Hobbes scholarship continues to develop, as evidenced by\nrecent works by Vanderschraaf (2007 & 2010), Moehler (2009), and\nChung (2015). And, while Hobbes\u2019 arguments have attracted the\nmost attention from game-theoretic minded scholars, Grotius (1625),\nPufendorf (1673), Locke (1689), Hume (1740), and Rousseau (1755) also\noffer what can be interpreted as informal game-theoretic arguments in\ntheir discussions of morality, the State of Nature, and the natural\nlaw. Of these, Hume\u2019s analysis of convention in the\nTreatise (Hume 1740: 3.2.2\u201310) is particularly\nnoteworthy for its informal account of equilibria and analysis of the\nrole that mutual knowledge plays in allowing agents to arrive at and\nsustain certain equilibria (Vanderschraaf 1998). Moreover,\nHume\u2019s discussion of how agents can settle into conventions as\nthe result of gradual trial and error processes, and his suggestion\nthat agents follow some conventions as a result of properties that\nmake certain alternatives conspicuous, anticipates analyses of games\nbased on both inductive learning and focal points (Skyrms 1996; Sugden\n1986).\n",
