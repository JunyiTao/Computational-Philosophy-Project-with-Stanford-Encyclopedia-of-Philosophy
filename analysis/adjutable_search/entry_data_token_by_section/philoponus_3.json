    "main_text": "Extant Philosophical Commentaries || Theory of Impetus\n2.2 Theory of Impetus\n\n\nThe Physics commentary contains an array of examples of\ninnovative and damagingly critical commentary. One of the most\ncelebrated achievements is the theory of impetus, which is commonly\nregarded as a decisive step away from an Aristotelian dynamics towards\na modern theory based on the notion of inertia. Concepts akin to those\ndeployed in Philoponus\u2019 impetus theory appear in earlier writers\nsuch as Hipparchus (2nd c. BCE) and Synesius (4th c. CE), but\nPhiloponus nowhere intimates that he was influenced by any one of\nthem. As far as one can tell from the text In Phys. 639\u201342,\nhe takes his point of departure from an unsatisfactory Aristotelian\nanswer to a problem that was to puzzle scientists for centuries: Why\ndoes an arrow continue to fly after it has left the bow-string, or a\nstone after it has ceased to be in contact with the hand that throws\nit? Since Aristotle supposed that a) whenever there is motion there\nmust be something which imparts the motion, and b) mover and moved\nmust be in contact, he was led to conclude that the air displaced in\nfront of the projectile somehow rushes round it and pushes from\nbehind, thus propelling the projectile along. To be sure, the rapid motion of an object through a medium creates turbulence, but this turbulence does not sustain any movement but contributes to its deceleration. Aristotle\u2019s theory was still in\nvogue among Peripatetic scholars of the sixteenth century, despite the fact\nthat a thousand years earlier Philoponus had thoroughly dismantled it. He\nproposed instead, much more plausibly but still erroneously, that a\nprojectile moves on account of a kinetic force which is impressed on\nit by the mover and which exhausts itself in the course of the\nmovement.  Philoponus compares this impetus or \u2018incorporeal\nmotive en\u00e9rgeia\u2019, as he calls it, to the activity earlier attributed to light.\n\n Once projectile motion was understood in terms of an impetus in this\nway, it became possible for Philoponus to reassess the r\u00f4le of\nthe medium: far from being responsible for the continuation of a\nprojectile\u2019s motion it is in fact an impediment to it (In\nPhys. 681). On this basis Philoponus concludes, against\nAristotle, that there is in fact nothing to prevent one from imagining\nmotion taking place through a void. As regards the natural motion of\nbodies falling through a medium, it was Aristotle\u2019s contention that the\nspeed is proportional to the weight of the moving bodies and\nindirectly proportional to the density of the medium. Philoponus repudiates this view by appeal to the same kind of experiment that Galileo\nwas to carry out centuries later (In Phys. 682\u201384).\n",
