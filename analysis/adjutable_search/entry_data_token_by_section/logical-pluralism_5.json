    "main_text": "Objections to Case-Based Logical Pluralism || The Change-of-Meaning Objection\n2.3 The Change-of-Meaning Objection\n\nA different question is whether pluralists are correct to take rival\nlogicians to be disagreeing. A classical logician accepts as a logical\ntruth a principle which they write: \n\\[ A \\lor \\neg A\\]\n\n\nwhile the strong Kleene logician rejects (as a logical truth) a\nprinciple which they write in the same way:  \n\\[ A \\lor \\neg A\\]\n\n\nBut it only follows that they accept different logics if the symbols\nexpress the same principle in both cases, and in particular, if \u201c\\(\\lor\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\neg\\)\u201d\nmean the same in both.\n\nIn debate, monists have often been willing to allow that the\npluralists\u2019 different systems disagree, because they themselves\nhave wanted to maintain that their preferred logic is right, the rival\nlogic wrong. Still, the suggestion was famously made by Quine\n(1986: 81) that in a dispute between rival logicians \u201cneither\nparty knows what he is talking about\u201d since they cease to talk\nabout negation as soon as its core logical properties are\nseriously questioned.\n\nHjortland (2013) makes a useful distinction between two ways in which\nchange of meaning might be thought to undermine the disagreement\nbetween rival logics. With A-variance the meaning of\n\u201cvalid\u201d differs between the two logics, leading to a\ndisagreement about which arguments ought to be called\n\u201cvalid\u201d. With B-variance, it is the meaning of\nlogical constants, like \u201c\\(\\neg\\)\u201d\nor \u201c\\(\\lor\\)\u201d\nthat varies, so that the\nlogics attribute (or fail to attribute) validity to different\nprinciples.\n\n\nThe result is allegedly that for two logical theories with the same\nformal language, say classical and intuitionistic logic, there is no\ngenuine conflict between validity attributions. In the case of (A)\nbecause what is being attributed, i.e., validity, is not the\nsame in the two theories. In the case of (B) because that to which\nvalidity is being attributed, i.e., the argument, is not the same\nin the two theories. (Hjortland 2013: 359) \n\n\nThe pluralist thus needs a way to exclude the possibility that each of\ntheir preferred systems is correct, but that pluralism itself is\nnonetheless false, because those logics don\u2019t disagree about\nanything.\n\nWith respect to A-variance, case-based pluralists might choose to\nsimply agree that the different correct logics capture different kinds\nof validity. They may well think that requiring that different\nincompatible logics were correct was always too strong a\nrequirement on pluralism. Their goal was to show that they were\ndifferent but not truly incompatible after all.\n\nOne variant of this approach takes \u201cvalid\u201d to be a\ncontext-sensitive expression, perhaps with a character (like a\nKaplanian indexical) which picks out different properties in different\ncontexts. See, e.g., Caret (2017) for a positive defence of\ncontextualism and Stei (2020a) for a critical appraisal.\n\nTurning to the question of B-variance, one way for a pluralist to\nrespond is by giving a theory of the meanings of the logical constants\nand then arguing on those grounds that the constants in two different\nsystems mean the same thing. Proof theorists sometimes point to the\nintroduction or elimination rules for a logical constant as giving its\nmeaning, and on these grounds they argue that the same thing is meant\nby uses of it in two different systems. There is a nice example of\nthis in Haack\u2019s Deviant Logic:\n\n\nBut now consider Gentzen\u2019s formulation of minimal logic,\n(\\(L_J\\)): it differs from classical logic, not in respect of the\nintroduction and elimination rules for the connectives, but in respect\nof the structural rules for deducibility; namely, it results from\nrestricting the rules for classical logic, (\\(L_K\\)), by disallowing\nmultiple consequents. Since this restriction involves no essential\nreference to any connectives, it is hard to see how it could be\nexplicable as arising from from divergence of meaning of connectives.\n(Haack 1974: 10) \n\n\nOther authors take a more model-theoretic approach to\nconnective-meanings, perhaps arguing that shared (or overlapping)\ntruth-conditions are sufficient for sameness of meaning. Stei (2020a)\nprovides a useful overview of the change-of-meaning issues as they\nthreaten pluralism, and the question is also engaged with in Beall\n& Restall (2001: \u00a73), Hjortland (2013), and Kouri Kissel\n(2021).\n",
