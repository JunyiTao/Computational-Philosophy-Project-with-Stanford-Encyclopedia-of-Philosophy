To start,\nmany moral problems arise within medicine for which moral theories\nhave no answers. The applied model of applied ethics also presumes\nthat those involved in the analysis and solution of a moral problem\ntake it that the nature and description of the problem or quandary is\nnot in dispute, where in reality it is often not clear exactly what is\nthe moral issue at stake (Caplan 1980: 28; 1989; Agich 2001; and\nMagelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016). This model also\nimplicitly involves a na\u00efve suggestion, argues Caplan, namely\nthat by dint of expertise in moral theory, the well-trained\nphilosopher can almost immediately solve moral dilemmas in the\nintensive care unit or the emergency department (Caplan 1980: 27).\nMoreover, adherence to such a model of applied ethics forecloses the\nopportunity for medical ethics (or other fields of applied ethics) to\ninform theory construction, as the direction of influence on that\nmodel moves only from theory to the practical.\n",
