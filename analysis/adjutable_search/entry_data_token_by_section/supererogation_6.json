    "main_text": "Three Views of Supererogation: Problems of Justification || Unqualified Supererogationism\n4. Paradigm Examples\n\nThe analysis of concrete cases or examples is methodologically\nimportant in the philosophical discussion of supererogation. Unlike\nother subjects in ethics, like justice or duty, in which there is wide\nagreement about some core cases, supererogation is a concept the\napplicability of which is controversial. Unlike the concepts of\njustice and duty, which have deep roots in both ordinary language and\neveryday moral judgment, the idea of supererogation is only tenuously\nanchored in common moral discourse and the concept itself is a\ntheoretical construct. Examples cannot in themselves prove the truth\nof any of the previously discussed analyses of supererogation, but\nthey can definitely help in revising the various definitions of the\nconcept as well as make a case for one or another of its\njustifications. Admittedly, some measure of circularity is inevitable\nin such a method, since the way examples are understood and analyzed\nis also informed by the definition and the construction of the\ntheoretical concept.\n\nBeneficence and charity are often considered as typical examples of\nsupererogation. Unlike giving what is the recipient\u2019s\ndue (or what is owed to him as his right), charity is not\nrequired by justice, lies beyond one\u2019s duty. As the term\n\u201cgratuity\u201d indicates, it is not necessary but optional.\nCharity is typically open-ended (i.e. there is no specified limit to\nhow much one may give), is driven by altruistic intention, and is\njudged to be morally praiseworthy in a different sense than the\nfulfillment of a duty or respect for others\u2019 rights. But\nanti-supererogationists hold a harsher view of charity. Some regard\ncharity as a condescending attitude; others expose the underlying\nexpectation of return involved in any system of gifts (Mauss 1954) or\neven the logical impossibility of a real, free and gratuitous gift\nrelationship, since every giving involves an expectation of return\n\u2014 of both gratitude and a future gift (Derrida 1992). There are\nethical theorists who believe that our standards of distributive\njustice are far too minimalist and that much of what is considered\nsupererogatory in the transference of wealth from the rich to the poor\nshould really be considered obligatory. The more extreme version of\nthis critique suggests a principle of giving according to which one\nshould give all one\u2019s luxuries in order to satisfy the basic\nneeds of others. Thus, the realm of the supererogatory is radically\nnarrowed down, although it is hard to see how anti-supererogationists\ncan completely abolish it. Supererogationists for their part argue\nthat some distinction between justice and charity, between market\nexchange and voluntary giving, is good for both society and\nindividuals because it creates a sense of community and good will, not\nto speak of more utilitarian benefits. One classical example is the\nsystem of the provision of blood for medical purposes. Social\nscientists as well as philosophers have argued for the advantages of a\ncompletely voluntary (supererogatory) system of blood donation over\nthe commercialized or \u201cenforced\u201d systems (Titmuss 1973).\nBut it seems that the issue of the deontic status of charity is often\nof a normative rather than conceptual kind. It focuses on the\ndemarcation line between the obligatory and the gratuitous, both on\nthe personal level of the behavior of the individual and on the social\nand political level (e.g. how much do rich countries owe poor\ncountries and how much should be left to voluntary charity).\n\nThe problem of demarcation also plagues the paradigm case of\nsupererogatory behavior, the so-called saintly and heroic acts. Fire\nfighters rushing to a burning house to save its residents risk their\nlives in a way that moves every spectator. But are they not paid for\nit? Is it not \u201ctheir job\u201d? Are they not justified when in\na later response to a journalist\u2019s question they insist that\nthey only did their duty? The supererogationist might respond by\nturning our attention to a similar risk taken by a by-stander who\njoins the professional emergency forces and literally jumps into the\nfire. Deniers of supererogation might argue that although such an\naction is heroic, it ought not to have been performed, since the\nslight chances of saving the victims of the fire do not justify the\nvery high risk of loss of life of the volunteer. Kant at one point\nexpresses his doubts about the moral motive behind some of the extreme\ncases of moral heroism and warns against moral fanaticism and\nsentimentalism (Kant 1949).\n\nThere are however examples of morally good actions which can be denied\na supererogatory status only with much difficulty. Volunteering is a\ntypical act that cannot be reduced to a duty, even not in a\nhypothetical manner as qualified supererogationism might try to do.\nWhen a job or a task must be done by a group of people, the group\nmight select the individual who will do the job on the basis of some\nprinciple of justice or desert or, in the absence of such principle,\nby lot. In extreme cases, such as taking part in a highly risky\nmedical experiment, it may be the case that no selection process,\nincluding lottery, should be deployed. If an individual volunteers to\ntake upon herself the task rather than leaving it to the selected\nperson, and particularly when it is wrong to select anyone,\nthen clearly her act is supererogatory. Volunteering highlights the\noptional nature of supererogatory action in its purest form (the agent\ncan hardly hide behind the morally modest expression \u201cI only did\nmy duty\u201d). Promising is similar to volunteering in its optional\nnature which is not associated with the demarcation problem. One ought\nto fulfill one\u2019s promises, but making them in the first place is\nsupererogatory. This might solve a paradox which has been raised: is a\npromise to do a supererogatory act possible? It seems not, since the\npromise fulfilling act cannot be both an obligatory act of promise\nkeeping and a supererogatory act at the same time (Kawall, 2005). This\nmay lead us to the conclusion that it is impossible to promise to do a\nsupererogatory act since no act can secure the bare minimum of the\nobligation created by the promise maker: only a supererogatory act\nwould be considered as promise fulfilling and such an act is by\ndefinition not obligatory (Benn 2014). However, if the act of\npromising itself is supererogatory, then so is its fulfillment, even\nthough the expectation created by the promise means that after being\nmade it must be fulfilled. The paradox may prove to be illusory once\nwe distinguish between the general supererogatory nature of the\ncontent of the act (e.g. giving you a ride to the airport in the\nmiddle of the night) and the obligatory nature of its performance\nunder the specific circumstances of having promised to do so (Heyd\n2005). \n\nOf course, anti-supererogationists could argue that volunteering and\npromising are both imperfect duties, i.e. not obligatory in any given\nindividual case but nevertheless general requirements of virtue.\nPeople who never volunteer are morally condemnable; people who never\ncommit themselves by promising are morally defective and fall short of\nstandards of friendship and social behavior.\n\nThere are cases in which the supererogatory response is expressed in\nomission rather than in action. Forgiveness is a prime example of\nsupererogatory forbearance. The offended party refrains from reacting\nnegatively to the wrong done to him. Rather than the morally justified\nhostility and resentment that he was entitled to express, he shows\nforgiveness. There is, however a heated debate in ethical theory about\nthe deontic nature of forgiveness. Many philosophers and\nnon-philosophers alike believe that forgiveness is a moral\nduty, particularly if certain conditions like expressions of\nregret by the offender have been satisfied (e.g. Rashdall 1924). An\nunforgiving person is, accordingly, morally blameworthy. But for\nothers, forgiveness is the epitome of supererogatory action since it\nis completely gratuitous, dependent on the good will of the offended\nparty (Heyd 1982). There is also a middle way (Gamlund 2010) which\nconsiders \u201cunconditional forgiveness\u201d (that which is shown\nto unrepenting wrongdoers) as typically supererogatory, but\n\u201cconditional forgiveness\u201d (granted to offenders who\nexpress regret) as possibly a duty (depending on other\nconsiderations). For supererogationists the touching aspect of\nforgiveness lies exactly in its optional nature. Since the offender\ndeserves punishment (or at least resentment), he cannot at the same\ntime deserve (or have the right to) forgiveness. Despite the close\nsimilarity between giving and forgiving, it seems that the latter is a\npurer example of supererogatory act since it has a better chance of\nbreaking what Derrida refers to as an endless circle: while a gift\nimposes a duty (debt) which can be satisfied only by a slightly larger\ncounter-gift (which would initiate yet another round of giving),\nforgiveness is more a matter of attitude and has no measure.\n\nIt has also been suggested that toleration is, like forgiveness, an\nact of supererogatory forbearance: although the tolerator has a good\nreason for intervening in the wrong behavior of another, she chooses\nto refrain from such interference, letting the other lead her life as\nshe wants (Newey 1997, Benbaji & Heyd 2001). Thus, an analysis of\ntoleration as supererogatory is a possible solution of the\n\u201cparadox of toleration,\u201d viz. how can refraining from\nintervening in the wrong beliefs or behavior of others be considered\ndesirable. Note, though, that if toleration is taken as as\nsupererogatory, it cannot, for the reasons discussed above, be\nascribed to governments but only to individuals and groups of\nindividuals.\n\nHowever, even if certain acts of forgiveness and toleration exemplify\na supererogatory response, there surely are cases in which both are\nforbidden (the unforgivable and the intolerable) and there may be\ncases in which they are both obligatory (persistent pleas of the\noffender to be forgiven or the political demands of toleration of\nminorities in a multi-cultural society). A conceptually neat case for\ntesting our intuitions about the deontic status of forgiveness (and\ntoleration) is God\u2019s attitude to human sinners: is God\nbound by the principles of just retribution, i.e. not to\nforgive? Does he have a duty to forgive? Or is divine forgiveness a\npure act of gratuitous grace? If God can act supererogatorily, how\ndoes that reflect on the perfection of divine justice that it\ntranscends? The application of the concepts of forgiveness on the\npolitical level raise further questions. Even if the universal and\nunbiased rules of justice can be surpassed by individuals who show\nforgiveness or toleration, can institutions like the state or the\ncourts exercise such supererogatory restraint without violating the\ndemands of impartiality and equality before the law (Heyd 1978)? Legal\npardon granted by kings and presidents reflects this tension between\nthe wish to leave some measure of individual discretion in showing\nmercy to some public figures and the concern for the impartial\napplication of such supererogatory grace.\n\nThere are of course many other examples of supererogatory action\nalthough the length and nature of the list is dependent on the\ndefinition of supererogation we adopt and the view of its value. But\nto the extent that actions and forbearances are supererogatory we may\nsummarize their source of value as belonging either to their good\nconsequences (as in the case of giving and charity) or to the strength\nof character or virtue of the agent (as in the risky acts of heroism)\nor to the pure good will involved in choosing to do what lies beyond\nduty (volunteering, forgiveness, small favors).\n\nBeyond the complex philosophical debate about the nature and scope of\nsupererogation, the discussion of paradigm examples indicate that any\nethical system which does not allow for any actions beyond the call of\nduty would prove to be distressingly impoverished, even if\ncoherent.\n5. Complications and Extensions\n\nAs early as 1982 Derek Parfit raised the following question: imagine\nthat you can save the right arm of another person at a great cost to\nyourself; but if you decide to do so, you can save also his left arm\nat no extra cost to you; are you under a duty to save both\narms? Parfit\u2019s answer is the intuitive one: yes, you ought to do\nso (Parfit 1982, pp. 131-2). Yet this answer does not easily fit\ntheories of supererogation according to which if saving one arm is\nsupererogatory, saving two arms must a fortiori be\nsupererogatory. This question gave rise to more recent debates about\n\"Effective Altruism\". The idea is that even if there is no duty to\ngive to charity, it is wrong to give to a charity which is\nineffective; or in other words, once the bounds of duty are crossed\nand one\u2019s action is supererogatory, it ought to be optimal,\nespecially if the extra costs and risks are only marginal or\nnon-existent (Pummer 2016). If two children are stranded in a burning\nhouse and you risk your life by entering the house and save one child,\nyou ought to save also the other child if that does not incur further\nrisk to you. The two children have no claim on you as long as you\nstand outside just doing what your duty demands (calling the fire\nfighters); but once you are inside, the second child has a claim on\nyou to be saved too. The same justification not to save a child from a\nburning house (the extreme risk) must apply to both children. But once\nyou are inside the house and have already risked your life, this\njustification does not work if you choose not to save the other\n(Horton 2017). Against this demand for optimization (limited only by\nagent-relative qualifications) there is the unqualified,\nnon-consequentialist argument that one needs no excuse or exemption\nfrom avoiding entering the burning house and that optimization is not\na duty. Thus neither the two children together, nor the second child\nseparately, have a claim against the bystander for not acting in the\noptimal way (Sinclair 2018). Although for the non-consequentialist\nthere is no duty of optimization of the good, he or she admits that\nonce one gave up the justification for not entering the burning house,\none cannot use the risk in order to avoid saving the second child\nbecause the risk has already been undertaken in saving the first child\n(Sinclair 2018).\n\nA similar case of effective altruism is the following: By donating $0\nyou save no one; by donating $50 you save 1 person; by donating $5000\nyou save 500 people (which is proportionate to the previous option);\nby donating $10,000 you save 101 (which is irrational and a waste of\nmoney in comparison to the previous option); by donating $10,050 you\nsave 200 people (Wessels 2015, p. 90). Now, although the last option\nis very \"effective\" and makes excellent use of the extra $50 (in\ncomparison to the second option), the question is whether adding the\nextra $50 donated by the generous donor who gives $10,000 is\nobligatory. The poor person is commended for his supererogatory act of\ngiving $50 to save one person; cannot we regard the extra $50 of the\nrich person who donated $10,000 as his duty, especially in light of\nthe possibility of saving 100 more people by this small sum? Once you\ndonate $10,000 it is reasonable to expect of you to give the extra\nmarginal addition of another $50 so as to double the benefit of your\ndonation (i.e. saving 200 people). This demonstrates that the\nthreshold conception of the supererogatory as everything lying beyond\nthe obligatory requires some refinement. There are circumstances in\nwhich in the realm of the supererogatory some new obligations may be\ncreated (Wessels 2015). As we have seen, such circumstances exist in\nthe case of promises: promising itself is supererogatory; but once a\npromise is made, actions fulfilling the promise become obligatory.\n\nIn recent years there have been attempts to extend the scope of the\ncategory of the supererogatory to non-moral normative domains.\nSome discuss the idea of epistemic supererogation, the idea\nthat in one\u2019s search for knowledge one goes beyond some\nreasonable measure of epistemic responsibility by being more diligent\nor looking for more evidence than is usually required in such search\n(Hedberg 2014). All that is needed for such an extension of the\napplicability of the supererogatory is a normative domain which has a\nscale of value on the one hand (e.g. degrees of epistemic\nresponsibility) and standards of expected time and energy involved in\nthe search of the relevant value (e.g. knowledge). Similarly one may\nalso speak of supererogation in the context of prudence, when\none does more than can be expected of a normal level of care and\nself-control in sticking to a medically desirable diet (McElwee 2017).\nEven in business ethics the category of supererogation is used\nto describe behavior of firms which not only go beyond legal and\neconomic norms but also beyond corporate social responsibility and\n\"positive deviance\" (such as philanthropic activities). One example is\nJohnson&Johnson\u2019s decision to the recall of Tylenol after\nthe 1982 poisoning affair, in which legal counsels, consumers and even\nthe media did not consider it as morally necessary. This was an\nunprecedented decision which meant a huge financial sacrifice on part\nof the firm. Finally, supererogation is also applied in the sphere of\nprofessional ethics, such as the behavior of doctors. As\nagainst Rawls and Heyd, it is argued that supererogatory behavior is\nnot confined to the domain of natural duties but may hold also in\ncases of surpassing professional duties. For example, a nurse who\nbrings books from home to a patient in her ward is acting beyond her\nprofessional duty but she is still acting as a nurse and in that sense\nher act is \"continuous\" with her professional duties. The good\npromoted beyond the normal professional standard is \"profession\nspecific\" (Eriksen 2015).\n\nThese complications and possible extensions of the category of the\nsupererogatory challenge the \"standard model\" of supererogation by\nquestioning the assumptions about the specifically moral nature of\nsupererogation and the clear demarcation between the obligatory and\nthe supererogatory. \n",
