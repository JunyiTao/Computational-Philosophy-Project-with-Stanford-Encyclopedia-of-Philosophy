    "main_text": "Psychological Theories of Depiction || Recognition-Based Theories\n4. Realism\n\nAs we have seen, any plausible theory of depiction will need to\naccommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making. Art history\ncontains more sophisticated and fertile treatments of the concept of\nstyle than philosophy does, notably by Heinrich Wolfflin (1950), Alois\nRiegl ([1893] 1992), Erwin Panofsky (1997), Ernst Gombrich (1968), and\nMeyer Schapiro (1994). However, one topic in the theory of style on\nwhich there is a substantial philosophical literature is\nrealism.\n\nThe term \u201crealism\u201d and equivalent terms in other European\nlanguages were introduced into literary and art criticism during the\nnineteenth century, and paintings and sculptures are still commonly\ndescribed as realistic (faithful, true to nature, etc.) by critics and\nhistorians of art. However, many philosophers and historians of art\nsince the 1920s have expressed scepticism about the idea that some\nstyles of art represent reality more truthfully or faithfully than\nothers (Jakobson [1921/1971] 1987; Steinberg [1953] 1972; Nochlin\n1971; Stewart 1997). The most influential exponent of this view is\nGoodman, who argues that realism cannot be a matter of fidelity to\nnature, and cannot be measured by resemblance to reality, because our\njudgements about fidelity to nature depend on our visual habits, which\nare shaped in turn by the visual culture we inhabit, and the images we\nare used to seeing and interpreting. Resemblance cannot be a\n\u201cconstant and independent\u201d standard against which works of\nart can be measured, because \u201cthe criteria of resemblance vary\nwith changes in representational practice\u201d (Goodman 1968: 39).\n\u201cThe literal or realistic or naturalistic system of\nrepresentation\u201d, Goodman claims, \u201cis simply the customary\none\u201d.\n\n\nRealism is relative, determined by the system of representation\nstandard for a given culture or person at a given time. Newer or older\nor alien systems are accounted artificial or unskilled. (1968: 37)\n\n\nGoodman\u2019s argument has been challenged on several grounds.\nFirst, the realistic system of representation cannot simply be the\nstandard or customary one, because as an artistic style evolves,\nspectators are inevitably less accustomed to innovative subjects and\ntechniques than they are to the ones these modify or replace. So if\nGoodman\u2019s claim were true, an artistic style could never become\nmore realistic, in the eyes of spectators living at the time. But the\nhistorical record proves, on the contrary, that it does (Newall 2011:\n119\u2013121). Second, Goodman exaggerates the extent to which visual\nexperience is modified by art. Oscar Wilde famously claimed that there\nhad been no fog in London before it appeared in Turner\u2019s\npaintings. But in fact, writers generally described optical effects\nlong before painters learned to represent them. For example, the\nspinning highlights on a chariot-wheel were described by the Latin\npoet Prudentius many centuries before Velazquez captured this effect\nin paint. Third, even if the art we see does modify our visual habits\nand influence the resemblances we perceive to some extent, it does not\nfollow that realism cannot consist in resemblance or fidelity to\nnature. Compare the relationship between theory and observation in\nscience. The growth of scientific knowledge has enabled us to refine\nour observations of natural phenomena, and these observations have in\nturn enabled us to test scientific theories. There is nothing\nsuspicious about this interaction between theory and observation, and\nnothing that should make us wonder whether we possess a\n\u201cconstant and independent\u201d standard, with which scientific\ntheories can be assessed (see \u00a74; of the entry on\n theory and observation in science\n and  \u00a73 of the entry on \n Popper).\n\nIt is now generally agreed that the concepts of resemblance and\nfidelity to nature are too vague and metaphorical to explain what\nrealism is, and that \u201crealist\u201d or \u201crealistic\u201d\nart proceeds from specific values, methods and viewpoints, no less\nthan other kinds of art (Schapiro 1978). Furthermore, confusion about\nrealism is compounded by the fact that the term is used to describe a\nvariety of period styles, including late medieval and early\nRenaissance art, Dutch painting in the seventeenth century, and French\npainting in the nineteenth century. But it does not follow that\n\u201crealism\u201d is merely an honorific term, which we apply to\nart in a familiar style, or that fidelity to nature is a vacuous\nidea.\n\nThe fundamental distinction we need to draw, in order to clarify the\nconcept of realism, is between realism in subject-matter and realism\nin technique (Hyman 2005). Realism in subject-matter is about the\nchoice of subject-matter and the manner in which it is treated.\nRealistic art, in this sense, represents the lower social classes,\ncomic as opposed to tragic material, daily life as opposed to myth.\nFor example, in the paintings of Courbet, Manet and Degas the\ntraditional hierarchy of genres, which promoted the representation of\nhistory, myth or allegory, is definitively set aside, and the everyday\nlives of people belonging to the lower social classes are taken\nseriously, and placed in a contemporary social setting, as they are in\nthe novels of Balzac and Flaubert.\n\nRealism in technique is a different phenomenon, which can be traced\nback to the revolutionary developments in Greek art between the sixth\nand fourth centuries BC, specifically, developments in anatomy and in\nthe representation of space and light. Since philosophers and art\ntheorists abandoned the idea that realism can be defined in terms of\nfidelity to nature or resemblance, most of those who do not regard\nrealism as a purely ideological concept or a sham (e.g., Stewart 1997;\nNeer 2002) have defined realism in technique in terms of information:\neither the quantity of information recorded in a picture (Gombrich\n1960; Schier 1986), or the quantity of relevant or visually salient\ninformation (Lopes 1996; Sartwell 1994; Abell 2006, 2007; Kulvicki\n2006), or the ease with which information issues (Goodman 1968), or\nthe range of information (Hyman 2005), is said to be the, or the\nprincipal, measure of realistic art. (See also Walton 1990; Chasid\n2007; and Newall 2011 for comparable views.)\n\nAccording to Hyman, realism in technique can be defined in terms of\nthree characteristics: accuracy, animation, and\nmodality (Hyman 2005: 40\u201346). Accuracy means the\naccurate depiction of a kind of material or object or activity, such\nas water or satin, a palm tree or a dove, sleeping, galloping or\nmaking love. Animation combines mobility with the expression of\nemotion, character or thought (see also Penrose 1973: 268). The term\n\u201cmodality\u201d refers to the expressive potential available to\nartists during a particular phase in the development of an artistic\ntradition, in other words, the range of kinds of information that the\ntechnical resources available to artists allow them to record:\n\n\nThe technical resources of pictorial art are always limited in their\nexpressive range, as languages are also bound to be; and these\ntechnical resources, like languages, can expand in different\ndirections to express new ideas and new observations. The development\nof realistic techniques is the expansion of the modality of art, in\nother words, the expansion of what it is possible for art to\nrepresent. (Hyman 2009: 497)\n\n\nThe commonest argument debunking the idea of a realistic artistic\nstyle depends on the thought that artistic styles are analogous to\nlanguages (see above,\n \u00a72\n for references). The comparison is intended to underline the extent\nto which artists rely on systems of conventions, and to discourage the\nidea that some styles are more truthful, or closer to reality, than\nothers. For the things we say are not truer or closer to reality if we\nsay them in French, or English, or Chinese. However, the analogy\nactually supports the claim that expressive potential is the measure\nof realistic art. For languages are not like codes or scripts. For\nexample, the Hieratic and Hieroglyphic Egyptian scripts do not differ\nin the range of information they can be used to record, and neither do\nSemaphore and Morse code. But languages obviously differ widely in\ntheir expressive powers, and have expanded rapidly in some periods of\nhistory. Thus, the difference between trecento and seicento Italian\nart is comparable to the difference between the English of\nChaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and the English of\nMilton\u2019s Paradise Lost, not to that between Morse Code\nand Semaphore or between English and French (see Ackerman 1978:\n157\u2013160; Hyman 2005: 47).\n",
