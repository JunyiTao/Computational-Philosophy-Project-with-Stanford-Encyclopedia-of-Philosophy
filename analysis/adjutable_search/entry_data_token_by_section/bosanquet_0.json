    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBernard Bosanquet was born on July 14, 1848 in Rock Hall (near\nAlnwick), Northumberland, England. He was the youngest of five sons of\nthe Reverend Robert William Bosanquet by the latter\u2019s second\nwife, Caroline (MacDowall). Bernard\u2019s eldest brother, Charles,\nwas one of the founders of the Charity Organization Society and its\nfirst Secretary. Another brother, Day, was an Admiral in the Royal\nNavy and served as Governor of South Australia. Yet another, Holford,\nwas elected to the Royal Society and was a fellow of St John\u2019s\nCollege, Oxford.\n\nBosanquet studied at Harrow (1862\u20131867) and at Balliol College,\nOxford (1867\u20131870), where he came under the influence of German\nidealist philosophy, principally through his teacher T.H. Green and\nthe work of Benjamin Jowett. (Green reputedly described Bosanquet as\n\u201cthe best equipped man of his generation\u201d [Muirhead 1935,\np. 21; McBriar 1987, p. 3].) Bosanquet received first class honors in\nclassical moderations (1868) and literae humaniores (1870)\nand, upon graduation, was elected to a Fellowship of University\nCollege, Oxford, over F.H. Bradley. While at University College,\nBosanquet taught the history of logic and the history of moral\nphilosophy; his only published work during this time was a translation\nof G.F. Schoemann\u2019s Athenian Constitutional\nHistory.\n\nUpon the death of his father in 1880 and the receipt of a small\ninheritance in 1881, Bosanquet left Oxford for London, where he became\nactive in adult education and social work through such organizations\nas the London Ethical Society (founded 1886), the Charity Organisation\nSociety, and the short-lived London School of Ethics and Social\nPhilosophy (1897\u20131900). During this time he met and married (in\n1895) Helen Dendy, an activist in social work and social reform, who\nwas to be a leading figure in the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws\n(1905\u20131909).\n\nWhile in London, Bosanquet was also able to engage in philosophical\nwork, and many of his major publications date from this time. Some of\nthem\u2014such as The Philosophical Theory of the State and\nPsychology of the Moral Self\u2014were developed from\nlectures that he gave to adult education groups. He was an early\nmember of the Aristotelian Society, and served as its Vice President\n(1888) and President (1894\u20131898).\n\nIn 1903, at the age of 55, Bosanquet briefly returned to university\nlife, as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of St Andrews\nin Scotland. His health, however, was not good and soon he wished to\ndevote more time to philosophical writing. He retired in 1908 to\nOxshott, Surrey, where he nevertheless remained active in social work\nand philosophical circles. In 1910, Bosanquet was appointed Gifford\nLecturer in the University of Edinburgh for 1911 and 1912. The text of\nthese lectures\u2014The Principle of Individuality and Value\nand The Value and Destiny of the Individual\u2014serve as\nthe most developed statement of his metaphysical views. Understanding\nBosanquet\u2019s metaphysics, however, requires recognizing that it\nreflects his earlier work in logic, ethics, social work, and political\nphilosophy.\n\nThe publication of the Gifford lectures incited a good deal of\ncritical reaction to Bosanquet\u2019s views, particularly in\nmetaphysics (e.g., on the idealism/materialism controversy and on the\nnature of finite individuality), logic (e.g., concerning the status of\npropositions and the nature of inference), and ethics. Despite his\nvigorous participation in such exchanges, present throughout\nBosanquet\u2019s work is his desire to find common ground among\nphilosophers of various traditions and to show relationships among\ndifferent schools of thought, rather than to dwell on what separates\nthem.\n\nIn spite of the challenges to idealism from both within and outside of\nthe academic world, discussion of Bosanquet\u2019s work continued\nthrough the early decades of the 20th century. He died in\nhis 75th year in London on February 8, 1923.\n\nAt the time of his death, Bosanquet was arguably \u201cthe most\npopular and influential of the English idealists\u201d (Randall 1966,\np. 488). He was the author or editor of more than 20 books and some\n150 articles. The breadth of his philosophical interests is obvious\nfrom the range of topics treated in his books and essays\u2014logic,\naesthetics, epistemology, social and public policy, psychology,\nmetaphysics, ethics and political philosophy. For his contributions to\nphilosophy and to social work, he had been made a Fellow of the\nBritish Academy in 1907, and had received honorary degrees from\nGlasgow (1892), Durham (1903), Birmingham (1909), and St Andrews\n(1911).\n\nBosanquet was one of the earliest philosophers in the Anglo-American\nworld to appreciate the work of Edmund Husserl, Benedetto Croce,\nGiovanni Gentile and Emile Durkheim, and the relation of his thought\nto that of Ludwig Wittgenstein, G.E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell is\nsignificant, though still largely unexplored. Although F.H. Bradley is\ntoday far better known in philosophical circles, in his obituary in\nthe Times, Bosanquet was said to have been \u201cthe central\nfigure of British philosophy for an entire generation.\u201d\n",
