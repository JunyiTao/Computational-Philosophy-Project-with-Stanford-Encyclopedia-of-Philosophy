    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nWhen we think of evolutionary theory and natural selection, we usually\nthink of organisms, say, a herd of deer, in which some deer are faster\nthan others at escaping their predators. These swifter deer will, all\nthings being equal, leave more offspring, and these offspring will\nhave a tendency to be swifter than other deer. Thus, we get a change\nin the average swiftness of deer over evolutionary time. In a case\nlike this, the unit of selection, sometimes called the\n\u201ctarget\u201d of selection, is the single organism, the\nindividual deer, and the property being selected, swiftness, also lies\nat the organismic level, in that it is exhibited by the intact and\nwhole deer, and not by either parts of deer, such as cells, or groups\nof deer, such as herds. But there are other levels of biological\norganization that have been proposed to be units or targets of\nselection\u2014levels at which selection may act to increase a given\nproperty at that level, and at which units increase or decrease as a\nresult of selection at that specific level of biological\norganization.\n\nBut for over thirty years, some participants in the \u201cunits of\nselection\u201d debates have argued that more than one issue is at\nstake. The notions of \u201creplicator\u201d and\n\u201cvehicle\u201d were introduced, to stand for different roles in\nthe evolutionary process (Dawkins 1978, 1982a,b). In this case, the\nindividual deer would be called the \u201cvehicles\u201d and their\ngenes that make them tend to be swifter would be called the\n\u201creplicators.\u201d The genic selection argument proceeded to\nassert that the units of selection debates should not be about\nvehicles, as they formerly had been, but about replicators. It was then\nasserted that the \u201creplicator\u201d actually subsumes two\ndistinct functional roles, which can be broken up into\n\u201creplicator\u201d and \u201cinteractor\u201d: \n\n\nDawkins\u2026has replicators interacting with their environment in\ntwo ways\u2014to produce copies of themselves and to influence their\nown survival and the survival of their copies. (Hull 1980: 318) \n\n\nThe new view would call the individual deer the\n\u201cinteractors.\u201d It was then argued that the force of this\ndistinction between replicator and interactor had been\nunderappreciated, and if the units of selection controversies were\nanalyzed further, that the question about interactors should more\naccurately be called the \u201clevels of selection\u201d debate to\ndistinguish it from the dispute about replicators, which should be\nallowed to keep the \u201cunits of selection debate\u201d title\n(Brandon 1982; Mitchell 1987).\n\nThe purpose of this article is to delineate further the various\nquestions pursued under the rubric of \u201cunits and levels of\n selection.\u201d[1]\n Four quite distinct questions will be isolated that have, in fact,\nbeen asked in the context of considering, what is a unit of selection?\nIn\n section 2,\n these distinct questions are described.\n Section 3\n returns to the sites of several very confusing, occasionally heated\ndebates about \u201cthe\u201d unit of selection. Several leading\npositions on the issues are analyzed utilizing the taxonomy of\ndistinct questions.\n\nThis analysis is not meant to resolve any of the conflicts about which\nresearch questions are most worth pursuing; moreover, there is no\nattempt to decide which of the questions or combinations of questions\ndiscussed ought to be considered \u201cthe\u201d units of selection\nquestion.\n",
