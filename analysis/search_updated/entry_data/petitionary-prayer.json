    "preamble": "\n\nPrayer seems to be a prominent feature of every religion. When people\npray, they attempt to contact/communicate with special persons or\nentities, such as a God or gods, or dead relatives, or exemplary human\nbeings who are believed to occupy some special status.\n\nPeople pray for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes people pray in order\nto give thanks, sometimes to offer praise and adoration, sometimes to\napologize and seek forgiveness, and sometimes to ask for things. The\nfocus of this article is petitionary prayer, in which a petitioner\nrequests something. Historically, the philosophical puzzles\nconcerning petitionary prayer that have received most attention have\narisen in connection with the traditional monotheism shared by\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to traditional monotheism,\nGod knows everything that can be known, is perfectly good, impassible\n(unable to be affected by an outside source), immutable (unchanging),\nand free. God is also able to do anything compatible with the\npossession of the qualities just enumerated. In this entry, we will\nexplore the most prominent philosophical puzzles that arise in\nconnection with the idea of offering petitionary prayers to God, as\nunderstood along the lines just described, along with the most\ninfluential attempts to solve them.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Concept of Answered Prayer\n\nWhat would it mean to say that a petitionary prayer to God had been\nanswered? Petitionary prayers often make many differences to those who\noffer them, whether positive or negative (see Phillips 1981 and\nBr\u00fcmmer 2008), but the more philosophically interesting question\nis whether or not such prayers make a difference to God. And the\nquestion is not whether God simply hears or notices such\nprayers\u2014after all, we have assumed that God knows everything\nthat happens in the world and is perfectly good. Typically, when\nphilosophers discuss the effectiveness of petitionary prayer, they\nwonder whether petitionary prayers ever move God to act in some way.\nWhat would it mean to say this?\n\nPhilosophers usually assume that a prayer is answered if and only if\nGod brings about the thing requested in part because of the offering\nof the prayer, so that had the prayer not been offered, the thing in\nquestion would not have occurred. If you pray to God for rain tomorrow\nand it does rain tomorrow, this all by itself is not enough to say\nthat your prayer for rain was effective\u2014it must also be the case\nthat God actually brought about the rain at least in part because of\nyour prayer. If it would have rained anyway, without your prayer for\nrain, then it doesn\u2019t seem that your prayer for rain was\neffective. So an effective prayer would be a prayer that made a\ndifference by influencing God to act. (For more on this question, see\nFlint 1998, chapter 10, Davison 2017, chapter 2, Pruss 2013, Johnson\n2020, and Davison 2022, chapter 3.)\n2. Divine Immutability and Impassibility \n\nAs mentioned above, traditional theists believe that God is immutable\n(cannot change) and impassible (cannot be affected by anything\nexternal). These ideas are related to one another, but not identical:\nif God is immutable, then God is impassible. But just because God is\nimpassible, it does not follow that God is immutable\u2014God might\nbe able to change without being affected by any external source. If\nGod is both immutable and impassible, then it seems that no\npetitionary prayers are effective. \n\nA number of responses are open to traditional theists at this point.\nSome theists have argued that there are independent reasons for saying\nthat God is neither immutable nor impassible. For example, many people\nhave argued that God is both compassionate and forgiving. But to be\ncompassionate or forgiving seems to require being responsive to the\nactions of others, so perhaps we should not say that God is immutable\nor impassible after all (see the entry on\n God and other ultimates).\n \n\nA different response to the puzzle here would involve characterizing\nthe concepts of divine immutability and impassibility so that they\napply to God in a way that does not rule out the effectiveness of\npetitionary prayers. This is an interesting philosophical project in\nits own right (see the discussions in Creel 1985 and the entries on\n God and other ultimates\n and\n immutability),\n but its prospects for success fall beyond the scope of this\narticle.\n\nFinally, a third response would involve claiming that in cases of\napparently effective prayer, God is not really responding to the\nprayer but instead bringing about events as part of a providential\nplan, a plan that includes both the prayer and the apparent answer to\nit. Such a position is suggested by the following remark from St.\nThomas Aquinas: \u201cWe pray not in order to change the divine\ndisposition but for the sake of acquiring by petitionary prayer what\nGod has disposed to be achieved by prayer (quoted and discussed at\nlength in Stump 1979).\u201d Given the way that we have characterized\neffective prayer above, though, this approach seems to deny that\npetitionary prayers are effective, so it would not solve the problem\nat hand. \n3. Divine Omniscience\n\nA different puzzle concerning the effectiveness of petitionary prayer\narises in connection with divine omniscience, the idea that God knows\neverything that can be known. If God already knows the future, for\ninstance, then how can petitionary prayer make a difference? The\nfuture, after all, is just the set of things that will happen. If God\nknows the future in all of its detail, then it seems that there is no\nroom for petitionary prayers to be effective: either the thing\nrequested in prayer is something that God already knows will be done,\nor it isn\u2019t, and either way, it looks like the prayer can make\nno difference. Like many other questions in theology, this puzzle\nraises an interesting question about the limits of God\u2019s\nknowledge. Is it possible for anyone, including God, to know the\nfuture in all of its detail? Philosophers disagree sharply about this.\nHere we will explore briefly three possible answers to this question.\n(For more on this, see Borland 2006 (Other Internet Resources) and the\nentries on\n omniscience\n and\n prophecy.)\n\nFirst, according to the view known as \u201copen theism,\u201d God\ncannot know those parts of the future that are yet to be determined,\nsuch as the future free actions of human beings, either because there\nare no truths to be known yet or because there is no way for anyone,\nincluding God, to know them (see Hasker 1989, Rissler 2006, the entry\non\n process theism,\n Other Internet Resources). This does not mean the God is not\nomniscient, because God still knows everything that can be known (and\nthat is what it means to be omniscient, according to open theists). So\nopen theists have a way to defuse the puzzle for petitionary prayer\ninvolving omniscience concerning the future: if our prayers are free,\nor God\u2019s decision whether or not to answer them is free (or\nboth), then those things cannot be part of a determined future and God\ncannot know about them in advance. But open theism is controversial\nbecause (among other things: see Rissler 2006) it appears to deny\nsomething that theists have affirmed traditionally, namely, that God\nknows the future in all of its detail.\n\nSecond, there is something called the \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d\nview. This position holds that God knows the future in all of its\ndetail as a result of knowing both (1) what everyone and everything\nwould do in any possible situation and (2) which situations everyone\nand everything will be placed in actually (see Flint 1998). According\nto this picture, God knows the future in all of its detail, but what\nGod knows about the future free choices of human beings depends on\nwhat they would choose\u2014and that is something that is up to the\nhuman beings in question, not up to God. Even though God knows what\nyou will do in the future, according to this picture, it is still up\nto you. In fact, when you make a free choice, you have the ability to\ndo something such that were you to do it, God would have always known\nsomething different from what he knows in fact. (This is sometimes\ndescribed in terms of having so-called \u201ccounterfactual\npower\u201d with respect to God\u2019s knowledge: see Flint\n1998.)\n\nAccording to the proponents of middle knowledge, then, petitionary\nprayer can still make a difference because God can take into account\nthose prayers that can be offered in the future when God plans how to\ncreate the world over time. The mere fact that God knows the future in\nall of its detail does not mean that this future is determined. So the\nproponents of middle knowledge have a way to answer the puzzle\nconcerning omniscience. But the theory of middle knowledge is very\ncontroversial; critics wonder whether there are truths about what\neveryone and everything would do in every situation, and even if there\nwere, how God could know such things (see the entry on\n prophecy and Zagzebski 2011).\n\nDefenders of a view called \u201ctimeless eternity\u201d hold that\nGod knows all of history at once, from a point of view outside of time\naltogether (see the entry on\n eternity.)\n Like the proponents of middle knowledge, the defenders of timeless\neternity will say that just because God knows the future, this does\nnot mean that God determines it. They will also say that God\u2019s\nsingle act of creation from outside of time has many effects in time,\nincluding, perhaps, answers to prayers that God anticipates from the\npoint of view of eternity. In this way, the defenders of timeless\neternity can answer the puzzle concerning omniscience. But like open\ntheism and the theory of middle knowledge, the idea that God is\ntimelessly eternal is controversial too; for one thing, if God can\ntell from the point of view of eternity what people will pray in the\nfuture, God should also be able to tell what God will do (if anything)\nin that same future, so it is hard to see how such knowledge could\ninform divine choices (see Hasker 1989, Flint 1998, Pruss 2007, Hunt\n2009, and Zagzebski 2011).\n\nIt is worth noting, in this section, the view known as \"theological\ndeterminism,\" according to which God determines everything in every\ndetail, and so knows the past, present, and future on this basis.\nAlthough theological determinism raises other questions about\ncreaturely responsibility and the problem of evil, it certainly\nexplains how God could know about future prayers in a way that permits\nGod to answer them. (For more on these questions, see Hasker 1989,\nTimpe and Speak 2016, White 2019, and Furlong 2019.)\n\nIt is also worth noting, in this section, that some philosophers have\nargued that not only does it make sense to pray for the future if God\nexists, but also it makes sense to pray for the past as\nwell\u2014such prayers could be effective, depending on the extent of\nGod\u2019s knowledge. For example, given the way we have described\neffective petitionary prayer, it could be possible for a prayer for\nsomething to have happened yesterday to be effective, as long as the\nthing in question actually did happen yesterday. This is because God\ncould know that I would offer the prayer in the future, and could have\ntaken this into account yesterday, as long as God can know the future.\nSo defenders of middle knowledge and timeless eternity can say that\nprayers for the past might be effective (but open theists, it seems,\ncannot say this: for more on this question, see Timpe 2005).\n4. Divine Moral Perfection\n\nTheists have traditionally recognized a number of limits on\nGod\u2019s actions. For instance, it is common to insist that\nGod\u2019s omnipotence does not imply that God can do impossible\nthings, such as create stones that are too heavy for God to lift. It\nis also common to insist that God cannot do that which is\nintrinsically evil, because God is morally perfect. (For a discussion\nof petitionary prayers for bad things, see Smilansky 2012.) Since God\nis provident, one might also suspect that God would not answer\npetitionary prayers for things that would interfere with God\u2019s\nprovidential plans for the world. Within these limits, one might\nwonder whether there is enough room among the space of God\u2019s\nreasons for petitionary prayers to make a difference, and what kinds\nof reasons such prayers could provide for God.\n\nSome have argued that God\u2019s moral perfection implies that\npetitionary prayers cannot make a difference because God will do what\nis best for everyone whether or not anyone ever offers petitionary\nprayers for those things. If this were so, then it would seem that\npetitionary prayers are never answered in the sense described\nabove.\n\nIn response to this worry, a number of authors have suggested that it\nwould be better, in some cases, for God to bring certain things about\nin response to petitionary prayers than to bring about those same\nthings independently of any such requests. In order to explore this\nidea, it is helpful to draw a distinction. Sometimes people pray for\nthemselves, and sometimes they pray for others. Let\u2019s call the\nfirst kind of prayer \u201cself-directed,\u201d and let\u2019s call\nthe second kind of prayer \u201cother-directed.\u201d\n\nFirst, consider self-directed prayers. Eleonore Stump argues that in\nsome cases, God waits for us to ask for something before granting it\nin order to avoid spoiling or overwhelming us. We could be spoiled by\nGod if God answered all of our prayers automatically, and we could be\noverwhelmed by God if God provided everything good for us without\nwaiting for us to ask first (Stump 1979). In a similar vein, Michael\nMurray and Kurt Meyers argue that by making the provision of certain\nthings dependent on petitionary prayer, God helps us to avoid\nidolatry, which is a sense of complete self-sufficiency that fails to\nrecognize God as the source of all good things. They also say that\nrequiring petitionary prayer in some cases helps us to learn about\nGod\u2019s will as we recognize the patterns in prayers answered (and\nnot answered: see Murray and Meyers 1994 and section 5 below).\n\nSecond, consider other-directed prayers. Murray and Meyers argue that\nif God makes the provision of certain things for others dependent on\nour prayers for them, then this can help to build interdependence and\ncommunity (Murray and Meyers 1994). By contrast, Richard Swinburne and\nDaniel and Frances Howard-Snyder argue that by requiring petitionary\nprayers in some cases, God gives us more responsibility for the\nwell-being of ourselves and others than we would enjoy otherwise\n(Swinburne 1998, Howard-Snyder and Howard-Snyder 2011). Critics of\nthis approach have wondered whether this involves God using others as\na means to an end (Basinger 1983) or whether this really extends our\nresponsibility for others (Davison 2017, chapter 7).\n\nFinally, some philosophers (for example, Basinger 2004) note that\nthere are a number of ways to understand God\u2019s obligations\ntoward created persons, only some of which suggest that God\u2019s\ngoodness would be compromised if God withheld things because\npetitionary prayers were not offered. So there are a number of\nresponses that theists can make to the puzzle of petitionary prayer\nthat stems from divine moral perfection. (For more on this question,\nsee Davison 2017, chapter 6, and Davison 2022, chapter 4.)\n5. Epistemology\n\nWould it ever be possible to know or reasonably believe that God has\nanswered a particular petitionary prayer? As one might expect,\nphilosophers disagree about this question. Some theists think that for\nall we know, for any particular event that happens, God may have had\nindependent reasons for bringing that event about, so we cannot know\nwhether or not God brought it about because of a prayer (as opposed to\nbringing it about for other reasons\u2014for more on this argument,\nsee Basinger 2004, Davison 2017, chapter 4, Choi 2016, and Davison\n2022, chapter 4). This line of thought is especially interesting in\nlight of the recent popularity of so-called skeptical theism, which\nresponds to the problem of evil by claiming that we can never know\nexactly how particular events are connected with each other and with\ngood or bad consequences, some of which may be beyond our\nunderstanding (see McBrayer 2010, Other Internet Resources). Others\nargue that as long as people are justified in believing, in general\nterms, that God sometimes answers prayers, then it is possible to\nbelieve reasonably that one\u2019s petitionary prayer has been\nanswered when one knows that the thing requested has come to pass (see\nMurray and Meyers 1994, Murray 2004, and Choi 2016).\n\nA number of people have tried to conduct statistical studies to\ndetermine whether or not petitionary prayer is effective. These\nstudies try to measure the differences between groups of people, one\nof which is the subject of petitionary prayers, and the other of which\nis not. Although some earlier studies suggested a positive correlation\nbetween patient recovery and petitionary prayer (see Byrd 1998;\nHarris, et al. 1999; and Leibovici 2001), more recent studies\nhave suggested that the offering of petitionary prayer (and the\nknowledge that such prayers were offered) is not positively correlated\nwith patient recovery (see Benson et al. 2006).\n\nSome have suggested, though, that these kinds of studies are flawed\nfrom the outset (see Br\u00fcmmer 2008 and Davison 2017, chapter 5).\nIt would be difficult to to ensure that some group of people is the\nsubject of no petitionary prayers, for instance, since it is\nimpossible to prevent people from praying for those whom they know.\nAlso, God is typically assumed to be a free person, not a natural\nforce that acts automatically in all similar cases, so we cannot\nassume that God will simply ignore those people for whom petitionary\nprayers have not been offered. This means that even if a study showed\nsome statistically significant difference between the two groups of\npeople, we could not be sure that it was due to the offering of\npetitionary prayers alone, as opposed to some other factor or factors.\n\n",
