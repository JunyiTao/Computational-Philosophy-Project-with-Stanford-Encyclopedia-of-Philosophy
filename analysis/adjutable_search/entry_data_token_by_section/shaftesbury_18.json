    "main_text": "Religion || Virtue and belief in God\n7.4 Virtue and belief in God\n\nAnother significant feature of Shaftesbury\u2019s religious views is\nhis position on the relationship between virtue and belief in God.\nThis is the topic with which Shaftesbury begins the Inquiry,\ntelling us that his goal is\n\n\nto inquire what Honesty or Virtue is,\nconsider\u2019d by it-self; and in what manner it is influenc\u2019d\nby Religion: how far Religion necessarily implies\nVirtue; and whether it be a true Saying, That \u2018it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous, or share any real degree\nof Honesty, or Merit. (C 2.7)\n\n\nIt is in the context of addressing this question that Shaftesbury\ndevelops his ideas of the moral sense\u2014i.e., his view that within\nevery human is the means to understand morality and act in accord with\nit\u2014and the conclusion he draws from this is that one\u2019s\ncapacity to realize virtue is independent of one\u2019s religious\nbelief. Our moral sense naturally leads us to virtue (C 2.16\u201318\nand 25\u20136), and atheism does nothing at all to damage that\nnatural tendency (C 2.27). Shaftesbury thus denies \u201cthat it\nis impossible for an Atheist to be virtuous,\u201d contending\ninstead that some\n\n\nwho have paid little regard to Religion, and been consider\u2019d as\nmere Atheists, have yet been observ\u2019d to\npractice the Rules of Morality, and act in many Cases with\nsuch good Meaning and Affection towards Mankind, as might seem to\nforce an Acknowledgment of their being virtuous (C 2.4)\n\n\nRivers has suggested that establishing the independence of religion\nand morality is one the most important aspects of, and perhaps the\nprimary motivation for, Shaftesbury\u2019s development of the moral\nsense (Rivers 2000a).\n\nShaftesbury does believe, however, that religious belief can affect\none\u2019s moral sense and one\u2019s motivation to be moral. Belief\nin a perfectly good God promotes virtue in a number of ways. For\n\n\nnothing can more highly contribute to the fixing of right\nApprehensions, and a sound Judgment of Sense of Right and Wrong, than\nto believe a God who is ever, and on all accounts, represented such as\nto be actually a true Model and Example of the most exact Justice, and\nhighest Goodness and Worth. (C 2.51)\n\n\nAnd when God is represented as having\n\n\na Concern for the good of All, and an Affection of\nBenevolence and Love towards the Whole; such an Example must\nundoubtedly serve (\u2026) to raise and increase the Affection\ntowards Virtue. (C 2.56)\n\n\nShaftesbury also says that belief in a perfect God increases\none\u2019s motivation to be moral because one will have a strong wish\nto please the Supreme Being and because one will be better able to\nwithstand misfortune and hardship, which are important respects in\nwhich theism conduces to virtue in a way atheism does not (C\n2.56\u201377). In contrast, belief in an immoral God, which\nShaftesbury calls \u2018daemonism,\u2019 will have deleterious\neffects, promoting vice at the expense of virtue. For religious zeal\nbased on belief in a capricious and violent god will promote cruelty\nand barbarity (C 2.13; 2.35\u20136; 2.47\u201349).\n\n\n[W]here a real Devotion and hearty Worship is paid to a supreme Being,\nwho in his History or Character is represented otherwise than as\nreally and truly just and good; there must ensure a Loss of Rectitude,\na Disturbance of Thought, and a Corruption of Temper and manners the\nBeliever. His Honesty will, of necessity, be supplanted by his Zeal,\nwhilst he is thus unnaturally influenc\u2019d, and render\u2019d\nthus immorally devout. (C 2.50\u201351)\n\n\n\u201cReligion\u201d, Shaftesbury concludes,\n\u201cis capable of doing great Good, or Harm\u201d to one\u2019s\nmoral character, while atheism does not have an effect \u201cin\neither way\u201d (C 2.51).\n",
