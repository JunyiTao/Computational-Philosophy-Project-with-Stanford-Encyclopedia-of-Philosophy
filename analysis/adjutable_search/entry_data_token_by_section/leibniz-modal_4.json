    "main_text": "Human Freedom: Certainty without Necessity\n5. Why This World?\n\n\nLeibniz is famous for his \u201coptimism,\u201d that is, for the\nthesis that this is the best of all possible worlds. According to\nLeibniz, God surveyed the infinitely many possible worlds,\ndetermined which was best, and instantiated it or made it actual.\nIn an important article, \u201cTheories of Actuality,\u201d Robert\nMerrihew Adams dubs this the \u201cDivine Choice Theory\u201d of\nactuality. In the main article on Leibniz, the reasons for this\nview are presented. But it is important to see that there are\nseveral factors that contribute to God's choice: first, according\nto Leibniz, God chose the world that was simplest in hypotheses (or\nlaws) and richest in phenomena; second, it is claimed that God was\nchiefly concerned with the happiness of minds; third, since (it is\nargued) God sought to have the maximum perspectives on the universe,\nthe world is a plenum, filled with minds each of which expresses the\nworld from its own point of view.\n\n\nAlthough the Divine Choice Theory does seem to be Leibniz's preferred\nway to explain the origin of this\u2014the actual\u2014world, he\ndoes offer another explanation that deserves comment.  This is the\ndoctrine of striving possibles. According to this view, as\npresented principally in On the Ultimate Origination of\nThings (De rerum originatione radicali, 1697), each\nessence naturally strives for existence, and the actual world is\nsimply the final battlefield after all possible essences have engaged\nin mortal combat for survival. In short, this is metaphysical\nDarwinism, in which the most perfect (and mutually compatible)\nessences survive to constitute a world. Consider the following:\n\n\n\nFurthermore, in order to explain a bit more distinctly how temporal,\ncontingent, or physical truths arise from eternal, essential or\nmetaphysical truths, we must first acknowledge that since something\nrather than nothing exists, there is a certain urge for existence or\n(so to speak) a straining toward existence in possible things or in\npossibility or essence itself; in a word, essence in and of itself\nstrives for existence. Furthermore, it follows from this that all\npossibles, that is, everything that expresses essence or possible\nreality, strive with equal right for existence in proportion to the\namount of essence or reality or the degree of perfection they contain,\nfor perfection is nothing but the amount of essence.\n\n\n From\nthis it is obvious that of the infinite combinations of possibilities\nand possible series, the one that exists is the one through which the\nmost essence or possibility is brought into existence. In practical\naffairs one always follows the decision rule in accordance with which\none ought to seek the maximum or the minimum: namely, one prefers the\nmaximum effect at the minimum cost, so to speak. (G VII 303/AG\n150)\n\n\n\nSince the theory of Striving Possibles seems so obviously to\nconflict with the Divine Choice Theory and since the latter is so much\na part of Leibniz's mature system, we seem to have good reason to\nquestion how seriously to take this view. (The classic articles\non this issue are those by Shields and Blumenfeld listed in the\nbibliography.) There is, however, a common way to reconcile the\ntwo views: the Divine Choice Theory literally explains the origin of\nthis world, and the Striving Possibles Theory is merely a\nmetaphor. But a metaphor for what? Answer: for the moral\nevaluation taking place in the divine intellect. In other words,\nGod ought to be understood as surveying not simply all worlds (sets of\ncompossible essences) prior to creation but also, in some sense,\nindividual essences; and those essences which individually are most\nperfect and which collectively can form a world are in fact elected for\nexistence. \n\n\nIn conclusion, it has been claimed throughout this piece that\nLeibniz advances his unique views on modality in opposition to the\nviews of Hobbes and Spinoza. In short, the modal metaphysics we\nfind in Leibniz's system is a result of the attempt to combine\nthe insights of a mechanistic (and therefore deterministic) world-view\nwith the demands of orthodox Christianity. There are a number of\nimportant particular points to bring out here. First, on\nSpinoza's view, everything that is possible is actual; that is,\nthere are no unactualized possibilities. To claim that some\nparticular thing or event could have been otherwise or to claim that\nthe world itself could have been otherwise is simply to make an\nassertion without adequate knowledge. Indeed, one of the\ncornerstones of Spinoza's philosophy is the view that, if one has\nknowledge of the third kind, then one will recognize that\neverything happens out of the necessity of the divine\nnature. Second, if the Divine Choice Theory is the preferred\naccount of the origin of this actual world, then Leibniz stands in\nopposition to Spinoza both because the Divine Choice Theory entails the\nexistence of non-actualized possible worlds and also because it clearly\nentails a God that is anthropomorphic and transcendent. In other\nwords, the Divine Choice Theory requires a God in whom intellect and\nwill are distinct. Third, Leibniz's accounts of necessity\nand contingency are, obviously, in service of his commitment to the\nreal freedom of human beings \u2013 and this in the face of the\nmechanistic world-view to which he otherwise adhered. This should\nbe in no way surprising because Leibniz, unlike Hobbes and Spinoza,\nupheld the basic tenets of Christianity and had to explain how freedom\nand responsibility could be attributed to an individual, whose very\nnature (following Leibniz's account of truth) entailed all\nproperties, past, present, and future.\n",
