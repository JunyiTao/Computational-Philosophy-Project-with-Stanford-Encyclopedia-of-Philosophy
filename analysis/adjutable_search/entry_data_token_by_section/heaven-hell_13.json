    "main_text": "Heaven: Three Critical Issues || Freedom in Heaven\n5.1 Freedom in Heaven\n\nLike the arguments over universalism and human freedom, as briefly\nsummarized in section 4.2 above, the issue of freedom in heaven once\nagain illustrates the need for a reasonably clear and complete account\nof free will. It also illustrates how easily a purely verbal dispute,\nwhich is an apparent dispute that arises from different uses of the\nsame term, can sometimes disguise itself as a genuine disagreement\nover some matter of substance. With respect to the issue of freedom in\nheaven, here are a couple of additional examples to consider: (a) the\nhonest banker whose deeply-rooted moral and religious convictions make\nit psychologically impossible for him to accept a bribe in a given\nsituation, and (b) the mother whose great love for her newborn baby\nmakes it psychologically impossible for her knowingly to harm her\nbeloved child physically. The question of whether there is freedom in\nheaven seems relevantly similar to the question of whether our honest\nbanker freely refuses the bribe and whether our loving mother\nfreely refuses to do anything she knows would harm her baby\nphysically. \n\nConsider now three different non-compatibilist accounts of what it\nmeans to act freely and the implications that each of these\naccounts has for the possibility of freedom in heaven. According to\nthe first account, briefly introduced in section 3.1 above, freedom\nalways requires that PAP obtain; that is, one is free with respect to\nsome action A in a given set of circumstances only if it is within\none\u2019s power to do A in that set of circumstances and also within\none\u2019s power to refrain from doing A. So if no one in heaven, as\nChristians typically understand it, will ever have the slightest\ninclination to disobey God\u2014if, that is, it would be as\npsychologically impossible for the saints in heaven to disobey God as\nit would be for our loving mother to torture her beloved baby to\ndeath, then there can be no freedom of that kind in heaven.\nThis is not a matter for dispute; it is instead merely a matter of\nbeing clear about a specified use of the term \u201cfreedom.\u201d\nEither the saints in heaven retain a robust power to disobey God and\nto sin, or they do not have the kind of freedom that PAP specifies.\nOr, to put it another way: if the saints in heaven do have this kind\nof freedom even as Lucifer, according to one traditional\ninterpretation of his supposed fall from perfection, was able to\ncommit the primal sin in heaven, then they also retain the power to\nsin in heaven (see Matheson 2018, 66). \n\nA second account carries no implication that having the relevant\nfreedom in the present always requires an ability to do otherwise\nin the present, though it does require an ability to do\notherwise at various times in one\u2019s life history. For according\nto Robert Kane, \u201cAgents with free will . . . must be such that\nthey could have done otherwise on some occasions of their life\nhistories with respect to some character- or motive-forming acts by\nwhich they make themselves into the kinds of persons they are\u201d\n(Kane 1998, 72). In a similar vein, James F. Sennett defends the free\nwill of the saints in heaven by in effect arguing that they have\nfreely chosen their own moral character. \u201cA character that is\nlibertarian freely chosen,\u201d he therefore suggests, \u201cis the\nonly kind of character that can determine compatibilist free\nchoices\u201d (Sennett 1999, 74; and for a similar view, albeit\ntweaked a bit, see Pawl and Timpe 2008). The basic idea here seems to\nbe that one\u2019s own motives and character can determine a free\naction in the present only when one is fully responsible for the\nmotives and character traits that determine this action. \n\nA possible difficulty here is to provide a coherent account, not to\nmention an empirically verifiable account, of how certain undetermined\nchoices buried in a life history might render one responsible for\none\u2019s present motives and character traits. This is a problem in\npart because, as Manuel Vargas points out, \u201ceven freely chosen\nfeatures of our lives and ourselves can, because of our epistemic\nlimitations, yield unanticipated consequences\u201d (Vargas 2005,\n282)\u2014as, for instance, when someone sincerely cultivates moral\nintegrity and inadvertently produces some of the worst character\ntraits: moral rigidity, self-righteousness, and a lack of compassion.\nSimilarly, someone\u2019s worst choices and the lessons learned from\nthem may be the very thing that has the most profound effect on the\ndevelopment of a good character. So given our epistemic limitations\nand the unanticipated consequences of our free choices, is it any\nwonder that many Christian theologians view a good character as a gift\nfrom God rather than as something for which we can credit ourselves?\n\n\nA third account of freedom, sometimes neglected by those who emphasize\nthe importance of human freedom, is Susan Wolf\u2019s Reason View,\naccording to which \u201cthe freedom necessary for responsibility\nconsists in the ability (or freedom) to do the right thing for the\nright reasons\u201d (Wolf 1990, 94). But unlike the autonomy view, as\nshe calls it, such freedom does not require the ability to refrain\nfrom doing the right thing for the right reasons. Wolf thus commits\nherself to the following asymmetry: whereas committing a wrong (or\nimmoral) act freely requires an ability to do otherwise and\ntherefore to refrain from acting wrongly, doing the right thing for\nthe right reasons freely does not require an ability to act\notherwise. Such a view takes full advantage of the idea, expressed in\nsection 3.1 above, that the relevant freedom requires a minimal degree\nof rationality, and it might be modified slightly as follows. If a\nrelevant threshold of rationality requires only an ability to make\nreasonable judgments, rather than infallible ones, concerning the best\ncourse of action, then perhaps we can say that freedom consists in the\nability to follow one\u2019s own reasonable judgment concerning the\nbest course of action in a given situation (see Talbott 2009, 388).\nWhether one accepts such a modification or not, something like\nWolf\u2019s Reason View seems to accord perfectly with the religious\nview that those in heaven are the freest of all created persons, even\nas those in hell remain in bondage to sin (a bondage similar to an\nalcoholic\u2019s bondage to alcohol). Such a view also seems to\naccord perfectly with St. Paul\u2019s view that salvation is a means\nby which the will is released from its bondage to sin. \n",
