    "main_text": "Historical Accounts || Russell\n3.1 Russell\n\nRussell\u2019s The Principles of Mathematics was published\nin 1903. The book\u2019s very first sentence contains Russell\u2019s\ncredo about what mathematics is:\n\n\nPure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form\n\u201c\\(p\\) implies \\(q\\)\u201d, where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are\npropositions containing one or more variables, the same in the two\npropositions, and neither \\(p\\) nor \\(q\\) contains any constants\nexcept logical constants (Russell 1903 [2009: 3]).\n\n\nIt may seem odd that the propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are supposed to\ncontain at least one variable. Yet, according to Russell, even\n\u201c\\(1+1=2\\)\u201d contains variables once made fully\nexplicit\u2014namely \u201cIf \\(x\\) is one and \\(y\\) is one, and\n\\(x\\) differs from \\(y\\), then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two\u201d (Russell\n1903 [2009: 6]).\n\nIs Russell\u2019s credo a form of deductivism or structuralism, or\nsome admixture of the two? At the turn of the twentieth century, no\none clearly distinguished semantics and syntax, and Russell was no\nexception. This led Putnam to claim that what Russell really had in\nmind was, in our terminology, eliminative structuralism. (Putnam\nchristened the structuralism he attributed to Russell\n\u201cif-thenism\u201d; as explained in\n \u00a72,\n this entry avoids the term.) He urged:\n\n\nWhat he meant was not, of course, that all well formed formulas in\nmathematics have a horseshoe as the main connective! but that\nmathematicians are in the business of showing that if there\nis any structure which satisfies such-and-such axioms (e.g., the\naxioms of group theory), then that structure satisfies\nsuch-and-such further statements (some theorems of group theory or\nother) (Putnam 1967a [1975: 20]).\n\n\nHowever, Putnam\u2019s structuralist interpretation of Russell is\ncontroversial, not least because a structuralist reading appears to\nexplicitly contradict the deductivist wording of several passages\n(Kraal 2014: 1498). For example, with pure mathematics defined in the\nabove way, Russell went on to assert that\n\n\n[b]y the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other premisses\nof a general logical nature (e.g., \u201cimplication is a\nrelation\u201d), all mathematics can be strictly and formally\ndeduced; and all the entities that occur in mathematics can be defined\nin terms of those that occur in the above twenty premisses (Russell\n1903 [2009: 3]).\n\n\nThe emphasis here is clearly on deduction.\n\nTo prove the above deducibility claim is the stated objective of\nThe Principles of Mathematics (Russell 1903 [2009: xiii]).\nAnd like everyone else at the time, Russell tended to assume that\nlogical implication is a deductive relation. Thus, even if it was not\nhis intention to differentiate semantics and syntax sharply, as he\nhistorically was not in a position to do, his credo combined with the\nequation of logical with deductive implication committed him to\ndeductivism. Hence The Principles\u2019 key doctrine is more\nplausibly construed as a version of deductivism than eliminative\n structuralism.[7]\n",
