    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nRobert Boyle was born in Lismore, Ireland, on January 25, \n 1627.[6]\nHe was his parents\u2019 fourteenth, penultimate, child, and the last\nto survive to adulthood. Boyle was the youngest son and, after his\nsister Margaret died when he was 10, the youngest child of the\nfamily. Boyle speaks fondly of his parents, but he could not have\nknown them well.  His mother died in childbirth a few weeks after\nBoyle\u2019s third birthday, and he last saw his father just before\nhe and his brother Francis left for a continental tour when Boyle was\ntwelve.\n\nLike many children Boyle had his share of near escapes from serious\ninjury as a child, but the time and Boyle being what they were he saw\nin each of them the hand of God. Michael Hunter has pointed out that\n\u201cthe spiritual autobiography, aimed at chronicling God\u2019s\npurpose for the individual in question by recounting providential\nescapes, spiritual trials and conversion experiences,\u201d was\n\u201ca characteristic genre of autobiographical writing in\nseventeenth-century England\u201d (Hunter 1994a, xx), and Nicolas\nCanny notes that \u201cThe invocation of providence as an explanation\nfor accidental or chance happenings in this life was so commonplace\namong sincere Protestants in the early seventeenth century that it had\ncome to be considered irreverent or profane not so to attribute\nthem\u201d (Canny 1982, 28). But, though common enough, there is no\ndoubt that, in Boyle\u2019s case at least, the protestations were\nsincere. He continued to believe in this divine attention, though in a\nmore intellectual realm, throughout his life. In 1663 he wrote,\n\nAnd though I dare not affirm \u2026 that God discloses to Men the\nGreat Mystery of Chymistry by Good Angels, or by Nocturnal Visions\n\u2026 yet perswaded I am, that the favor of God does (much more\nthan most Men are aware of) vouchsafe to promote some Mens Proficiency\nin the study of Nature (Boyle Works [BW], 3:276, Birch 1772,\n II:61).[7]\n\n",
