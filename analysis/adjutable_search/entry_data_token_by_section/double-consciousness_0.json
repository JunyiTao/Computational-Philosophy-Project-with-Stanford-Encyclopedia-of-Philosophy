    "main_text": "The Trajectory of the Concept\n1. The Trajectory of the Concept\n\nIn an 1897 Atlantic Monthly article and again in his 1903\nSouls of Black Folk, Du Bois innovated by using a term\nalready in currency \u2013 and with multiple associations in a\nvariety of literary, philosophical, and scientific discourses \u2013\nin a distinctive and original way to name a theretofore largely\nunremarked phenomenon. The innovation was part of an account of the\nlife-experience he ascribed to \u201cblack folk\u201d in America\ngenerally in then-current social circumstances \u2013 Jim Crow in the\nsouth, de facto segregation in the North, and the threat and\nactuality of racist violence throughout the nation.\n\nThe term he used \u2013 \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d \u2013\ndropped entirely, after just these two uses, from his published\nwriting. Those uses nonetheless struck a chord; use of the term,\ninterpreted in a number of ways, has frequently recurred as the\ncentury since its appearance has passed. While the disappearance of\nthe term from Du Bois\u2019s writing after 1903 has fueled questions\nabout the significance of the concept in the overall assessment of his\nwork, some commentators insist nonetheless on the centrality of the\nconcept for Du Bois\u2019s legacy.\n\nDu Bois was engaged throughout his long career in the attempt to\nunderstand both the socio-historic conditions facing \u201cBlack\nfolk\u201d in the American twentieth century, and the impacts of\nthose conditions on the consciousness and \u201cinner world\u201d of\nthe human beings subject to them. In Souls of Black Folk that\nsecond concern was with capturing in words \u201cthe strange meaning\nof being black\u201d, with describing the \u201cspiritual\nworld\u201d and the \u201cspiritual strivings\u201d of \u201cthe\nAmerican Negro\u201d. Du Bois continued to articulate responses to\nthese concerns in his later works: one finds formulations addressing\nthem even in his posthumously published Autobiography (1968).\nAs the contexts of Du Bois\u2019s writing, research, and activism\nchanged, these responses shifted in focus, emphasis, and perspective.\nBroadly speaking, as his reflections on what he initially termed the\n\u201cspiritual world\u201d of Black folk came to be more richly\nfilled out in the variety and extent of its details, Du Bois\u2019s\naccount of the phenomena he originally identified with the term\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d both overflowed the initial\nassociations of that term and became stratified under pressure from\nhis shifts in perspective. In what follows, we trace the fate of Du\nBois\u2019s 1903 account in his later work and then assess the\nreconstructed account on its own terms.\n\nThis article will, first, briefly survey some of the attempts to\nexplicate and contextualize the use of the concept by Du Bois in\nThe Souls of Black Folk of 1903 (hereafter Souls),\nand give a brief overview of controversies regarding the viability of\nthe concept and its significance for contemporary Africana thought.\nAfter presenting suggestions concerning the development of Du\nBois\u2019s understanding of the phenomenon after Souls,\nwe\u2019ll look briefly at three recent distinctive uses of it\n\u2018beyond the black/white binary\u2019. (The term Du Bois used\nwas \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d, with the hyphen intact; more\nrecent writers have generally abandoned the hyphen. In this article\nthe hyphen is retained in discussing Du Bois\u2019s 1903 term and\nconcept, and interpretive attempts to get at it. But \u201cdouble\nconsciousness\u201d simpliciter is used when discussing the\nterm more generally in relation to current debates.)\n",
