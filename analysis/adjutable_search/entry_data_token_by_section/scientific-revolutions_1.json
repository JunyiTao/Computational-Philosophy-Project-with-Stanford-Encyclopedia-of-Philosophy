History of the Concept of Scientific Revolution\n\nWhat history lies behind the terms \u2018revolution\u2019 and\n\u2018scientific revolution\u2019? The answer is an intriguing mix\nof accounts of physical phenomena, political fortunes, and conceptions\nof chance, fate, and history. Originally a term applying to rotating\nwheels and including the revolution of the celestial bodies (as in\nCopernicus\u2019 title: De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium)\nand, more metaphorically, the wheel of fortune,\n\u2018revolution\u2019 was eventually transferred to the political\nrealm. The term later returned to science at the metalevel, to\ndescribe developments within science itself (e.g., \u201cthe\nCopernican Revolution\u201d). Christopher Hill, historian of\nseventeenth-century Britain and of the so-called English Revolution in\nparticular, writes:\n\nConventional wisdom has it that the word \u2018revolution\u2019\nacquired its modern political meaning only after 1688. Previously it\nhad been an astronomical and astrological term limited to the\nrevolution of the heavens, or to any complete circular motion. [Hill\n1990, 82]\n\n\nHill himself dates the shift to the governmental realm somewhat\nearlier, pointing out that the notion of overturning was also\npresent in groups of reformers who aspired to return human society to\nan earlier, ideal state: overturning as returning.\nThis conception of revolution as overturning was compatible with a\ncyclical view of history as a continuous process.\n\nIt was in the socio-political sphere that talk of revolution as a\nsuccessful uprising and overturning became common. In this sense, a\nrevolution is a successful revolt, \u2018revolution\u2019 being an\nachievement or product term, whereas \u2018to revolt\u2019 is a\nprocess verb. The fully modern conception of revolution as involving a\nbreak from the past\u2014an abrupt, humanly-made overturning rather\nthan a natural overturning\u2014depended on the linear, progressive\nconception of history that perhaps originated in the Italian\nRenaissance, gained strength during the Protestant Reformation and the\ntwo later English revolutions, and became practically dogma among the\nchampions of the scientific Enlightenment. The violent English\nRevolution of the 1640s gave political revolution a bad name, whereas\nthe Glorious Revolution of 1688, a bloodless, negotiated compromise,\nreversed this reputation.\n",
