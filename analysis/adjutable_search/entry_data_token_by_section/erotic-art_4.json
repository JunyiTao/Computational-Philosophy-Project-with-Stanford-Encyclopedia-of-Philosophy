    "main_text": "Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art || The Legacy of Modern Aesthetics\n2.2 The Legacy of Modern Aesthetics\n\nModern aesthetics has cast a long shadow into the 20th and\neven the 21st century, and the idea that the aesthetic and\nthe erotic are fundamentally incompatible has proved to be very\ninfluential throughout.\n\nClive Bell, the great champion of aesthetic formalism, inscribes\nhimself neatly in that tradition. In his landmark book, Art\n(1914), he begins by drawing a sharp contrast between the aesthetic\nemotion, which is provoked by works of art in virtue of a certain\npleasing combination of lines and colors, and sexual feelings and\ndesires which are provoked by sensually appealing bodies. The two\ncould not be more different, he thinks:\n\n\nlet no one imagine, because he has made merry in the warm tilth and\nquaint nooks of romance, that he can even guess at the austere and\nthrilling raptures of those who have climbed the cold, white peaks of\nart. (1961 [1914]: 42)\n\n\nNevertheless, Bell acknowledges, as did Shaftesbury, that the two\nemotions are often confused partly because in everyday speech the word\n\u201cbeauty\u201d is used indiscriminately for items that fall in\neach of the two categories (beautiful works of art, attractive men and\nwomen). To prevent any further confusion, he insists therefore on\nusing the word \u201csignificant form,\u201d instead of beauty, for\nthe combination of lines and colors that produces the aesthetic\nemotion. (Shaftesbury, one will recall, was revisionist in the\nopposite direction, refusing to employ the word beauty for that which\nis merely desirable.)\n\nWhat about those works of art that appeal to our sensual feelings and\ndesires and that are so popular with the man in the street?\n\n\nThe art that they call \u201cbeautiful\u201d is generally closely\nrelated to the women. A beautiful picture is a photograph of a pretty\ngirl; beautiful music, the music that provokes emotions similar to\nthose provoked by young ladies in musical farces; and beautiful\npoetry, the poetry that recalls the same emotions felt, twenty years\nearlier, for the rector\u2019s daughter. (1961 [1914]:\n28\u201329)\n\n\nBell has no patience with ignorant folks who seek out pictures, poems,\nor music for these reasons. They are simply confusing the sensual and\nthe aesthetic. Of course, this does not mean that paintings depicting\npretty girls cannot be art. They can, but if they are art, they will\nbe so despite their erotic content. For example, when Manet\u2019s\nOlympia, a picture of a\nprostitute, caused a storm of indignation in Paris of the 1860s, Emile\nZola defended the painting in terms that Bell would have approved\nof:\n\n\nTell them aloud, dear master, that you are not what they think you\nare, that a painting is for you a mere pretext for analysis. You\nneeded \u2026 clear and luminous tones, and you introduced a\nbouquet; you needed black tones and you placed in a corner a Negress\nand a cat. (Zola 1991: 161)\n\n\nFor Bell and his fellow formalists, significant form is the only\nimportant artistic criterion. Where it comes to insulating the\naesthetic from the erotic, many prominent philosophers in the\n20th century have followed in Bell\u2019s footsteps, even\nwhen they do not subscribe to his formalism. In The Principles of\nArt (1938), R. G. Collingwood observes how \u201cthe words\n\u2018beauty\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019, as actually used, have\nno aesthetic implication\u201d since they often indicate \u201cthe\nsatisfaction of some desire or the arousing of some emotion\u201d\n(1938: 38\u201341). For Collingwood, a beautiful man or woman\nordinarily means one whom we find sexually desirable. And he firmly\nstates that this \u201chas nothing whatever to do with aesthetic\nexperience. It has to do with that other kind of experience that Plato\ncalled eros\u201d (1938: 41). Similarly, Monroe Beardsley\ninsisted on a strict divide between the two sorts of responses and\nrevised his theory of aesthetic experience when it was pointed out to\nhim that it did not exclude sexual experiences from the realm of the\naesthetic (Beardsley 1982). Edward Bullough famously posited\n\u201cpsychical distance\u201d as a prerequisite for experiencing\nart and concluded that\n\n\nexplicit references to organic affections, \u2026 especially to\nsexual matters, lie normally below the Distance-limit, and can be\ntouched on by Art only with special precautions. (1969: 403)\n\n\nEven in the 21st century one will find philosophers who are\ndeeply sceptical about the aesthetic and artistic potential of the\nerotic. Mohan Matthen, for instance, states that \u201cerotic art\ntends not to be great art\u201d because\n\n\neven when erotica are artistic \u2026 they have too direct an effect\non sexual response, and this distracts the viewer\u2019s attention\naway from the work itself. (2011: 354)\n\n\nThe more erotic a work of art, the more difficult it is to appreciate\naesthetically. Matthen makes this claim in an essay review of The\nArt Instinct (2009), a book on evolutionary aesthetics written by\nDenis Dutton, who also claims that eroticism is best avoided in art,\nthough for different reasons than Matthen. While the latter considers\nthe sexual response too distracting, Dutton argues that it is rather\ntoo crude and too basic to count as a proper aesthetic response. A\nhigh degree of meaning-complexity is the hallmark of all great art,\naccording to Dutton, but while love is complex, \u201c(s)ex itself is\njust too simple\u201d (2009: 238). As a consequence,\n\n\nlove is the most pervasive theme for representative arts everywhere,\n(whereas) explicit eroticism does not tend to figure importantly in\nthe greatest masterpieces. (2009: 238)\n\n\nJust like a bowl of corn syrup and a plate of sugar will never be\ndinner, Dutton flippantly observes, erotic paintings, novels, and\npoems will never qualify as art of the highest order. (It is certainly\nnoteworthy that Dutton, who is the antipode of modern aesthetics in\ndoing away with the very notion of a disinterested pleasure and\nassuming that matters of sexual reproduction are vital in explaining\nour interest in art and aesthetics, actually finds himself in the\ncompany of Schopenhauer, Kant, and Shaftesbury where erotic art is\nconcerned.)\n\nTo recapitulate: if (disinterested, contemplative) aesthetic responses\nare indeed irreconcilable with (interested, bodily) sexual responses,\nas so many philosophers of art in the past have thought, then there\nhardly remains any conceptual space for works that aim for both kinds\nof response. Yet, we do, as a matter of fact, have this longstanding\ntradition of erotic art, not just in the West but also in many\nnon-Western cultures. How to account for this?\n\nProponents of modern aesthetics could simply bite the bullet here and\nargue, as Mohan Matthen does, that erotic art tends not to be great\nart, or, following Bell, that erotic paintings, books, poems can only\nattain art status despite their erotic content. But that is a big\nbullet to bite, by any standard. Not only are there so many\noutstanding works of erotic art, but the eroticism of these works is\nalso more often than not an integral part of their status and value as\nart. To be sure, there are nude paintings and sculptures which seem to\nqualify first and foremost as studies in formal beauty (certain\nsculptures of Henry Moore come to mind). But anyone who would regard,\nsay, The Naked Maja by Goya (c.\n1797\u20131800) or Les D\u00e9lassements\nd\u2019Eros by Gerda Wegener (1925) as a mere formal exercise\nwould entirely misunderstand and fail to appreciate what these works\nare about. That is why the great majority of aestheticians today\nprefer the other horn of the dilemma. Instead of denying the existence\nof genuinely erotic art, they will deny that aesthetic and erotic\nresponses are antithetical and hence reject the basic tenets of modern\naesthetics.\n",
