    "main_text": "Fair allocation || Extensions\n6.2 Extensions\n\nKolm\u2019s (1972) seminal monograph focused on the simple problem of\ndistributing a bundle of non-produced commodities, and on equity as\nno-envy. Other economic problems, and other fairness concepts, have\nbeen studied later. Here is a non-exhaustive list of other economic\nproblems that have been analyzed: sharing labor and consumption in the\nproduction of a consumption good; producing a public good and\nallocating the contribution burden among individuals; distributing\nindivisible commodities, with or without the possibility of making\nmonetary compensations; matching pairs of individuals (men-women,\nemployers-workers\u2026); distributing compensations for\ndifferential needs; rationing on the basis of claims; distributing a\ndivisible commodity when preferences are satiable. In the main stream\nof this theory, the problem is to select a good subset of allocations\nunder perfect knowledge of the characteristics of the population and\nof the feasible set. There is also a branch which studies cost and\nsurplus sharing, when the only information available are the\nquantities demanded or contributed by the population, and the cost or\nsurplus may be distributed as a function of these quantities only (see\nMoulin 2002). The relevance of this literature for political\nphilosophers should not be underestimated. Even models which seem to\nbe devoted to narrow microeconomic allocation problems may turn out to\nbe quite relevant, and some models are addressing issues already\nsalient in political philosophy. This is the case in particular for\nthe model of production of a private good when individuals have\nunequal skills, which is a rough description of a market economy, and\nfor the model of differential needs. Both models are especially\nrelevant for analyzing the issue of responsibility, talent and\nhandicap, which is now prominent in egalitarian theories of justice. A\nsurvey on these two models in made in Fleurbaey and Maniquet (2011a),\nand a monograph connecting the various relevant fields of economic\nanalysis to theories of responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism is in\nFleurbaey (2008).\n\nAmong the other concepts of fairness which have been introduced, two\nfamilies are important. The first family contains principles of\nsolidarity, which require individuals to be affected in the same way\n(they all gain or all lose) by some external shock (change in\nresources, technology, population size, population characteristics).\nFor instance, if resources or technology improve, then it is natural\nto hope that everyone will benefit. The second family contains welfare\nbounds, which provide guarantees to everyone against extreme\ninequality. For instance, in the division of non-produced commodities,\nit is very natural to require that nobody should be worse-off than at\nthe equal-split allocation (i.e. the allocation in which everyone gets\nthe per capita amount of resources).\n\nLet us briefly describe some of the insights that are gained through\nthis theory and seem relevant to political philosophy. A very\nimportant one is that there is a conflict between no-envy and\nsolidarity (Moulin and Thomson 1988, 1997). This conflict is well\nillustrated by the fact that in a market economy, typically any change\nin technology benefits some agents and hurts others, even when the\nchange is a pure progress which could benefit all. Solidarity\nprinciples are not obeyed by allocation rules which pass the no-envy\ntest, and these principles point toward a different kind of\ndistribution, named \u201cegalitarian-equivalence\u201d by Pazner\nand Schmeidler (1978). An allocation is egalitarian-equivalent when\neveryone is indifferent between his bundle in this allocation and the\nbundle he would have in an egalitarian economy defined in some simple\nway. For instance, the egalitarian economy may be such that everyone\nhas the same bundle. In this case, an egalitarian-equivalent\nallocation is such that everyone is indifferent between his bundle and\none particular bundle. In more sophisticated versions, the egalitarian\neconomy is such that everyone has the same budget set, in some\nparticular family of budget sets. Egalitarian-equivalence is a serious\nalternative to no-envy for the definition of equality of resources,\nand its superiority in terms of solidarity is quite significant, in\nrelation to the next point.\n\nThe second insight, indeed, is that no-envy itself is a combination of\nconflicting principles (Fleurbaey and Maniquet 2011a, Fleurbaey 2008).\nThis conflict is made apparent in models with talents and handicaps.\nFor instance, Pazner and Schmeidler (1974) found out that there may\nnot exist envy-free and Pareto-efficient allocations in the context of\nproduction with unequal skills (when there are high-skilled\nindividuals who are strongly averse to labor). This results from an\nincompatibility between a compensation principle saying that\nindividuals with identical preferences should have equivalent bundles\n(suppressing inequalities due to skills), and a reward principle\nsaying that individuals with the same skills should not envy each\nother (no preferential treatment on the basis of different\npreferences). Both principles are a logical implication of the no-envy\ntest. This is obvious for the latter. For the former, notice that\nno-envy among individuals with the same preferences means that they\nmust have bundles on the same indifference curve. Interestingly, the\ncompensation principle is a logical consequence of solidarity\nprinciples and is therefore perfectly compatible with them. It is very\nwell satisfied by egalitarian-equivalent allocation rules. In\ncontrast, it is violated by Dworkin\u2019s hypothetical insurance\nwhich applies the no-envy test behind a veil of ignorance (see Dworkin\n2000, Fleurbaey 2008, and\n \u00a7 3.2).\n A recent philosophical analysis of the no-envy approach has been\ndeveloped in Olson (2020). The relation between envy and theories of\njustice is also scrutinized in the entry on\n envy.\n\nThe theory of fair allocations contains many positive results about\nthe existence of fair allocations, for various fairness concepts, and\nthis stands in contrast to Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem in the\ntheory of social choice. The difference between the two theories has\noften been interpreted as due to the fact that they perform different\nexercises (Sen 1986, Moulin and Thomson 1997). The theory of social\nchoice, it is said, seeks a ranking of all options, while the theory\nof fair allocation focuses on the selection of a subset of\nallocations. This explanation is not convincing, since selecting a\nsubset of fair allocations is formally equivalent to defining a\nfull-blown albeit coarse ranking, with \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d allocations. A more convincing explanation lies in\nthe fact that the information used in fairness criteria is richer than\nallowed by Arrow\u2019s Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives\n(Fleurbaey, Suzumura and Tadenuma 2002). For instance, in order to\ncheck that an allocation is envy-free while another displays envy, it\nis not enough to know how individuals rank these two allocations in\ntheir preferences. One must know individual preferences over other\nalternatives involving permutations of bundles (an envious individual\nwould prefer an allocation in which his bundle is permuted with one he\nenvies). In this vein, one discovers that it is possible to extend the\ntheory of fair allocation so as to construct fine-grained rankings of\nall allocations. This is very useful for the discussion of public\npolicies in \u201csecond-best\u201d settings, that is, in settings\nwhere incentive constraints make it impossible to reach\nPareto-efficiency. With this extension, the theory of fair allocation\ncan be connected to the theory of optimal taxation (Maniquet 2007),\nand becomes even more relevant to the political philosophy of\nredistributive institutions (Fleurbaey 2007). It turns out that the\negalitarian-equivalence approach is very convenient for the definition\nof fine-grained orderings of allocations, which provides an additional\nargument in its favor. A detailed study of fair social orderings is\nmade in Fleurbaey and Maniquet (2011b).\n",
