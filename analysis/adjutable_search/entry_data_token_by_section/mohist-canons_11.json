    "main_text": "Epistemology || Awareness, Knowing, and Understanding\n5.1 Awareness, Knowing, and Understanding\n\nHumans who are alive and awake have a capacity or resource\n(c\u00e1i \u6750) called \u201cthe knowing\u201d\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) (A3, A22), roughly akin to the capacity\nor disposition to have conscious states and perform cognitive\nfunctions. (\u201cThe knowing\u201d is thus comparable in different\nrespects to our notions of consciousness and of \u201cthe\nunderstanding.\u201d) \u201cThe knowing\u201d is inactive in\ndreamless sleep (A23), and it is what has desires and aversions (A25).\nIt is the capacity by which we are aware and have knowledge of things,\nand, provided we are awake, it cannot fail to be aware of something.\nThe text compares it to eyesight: sighted people who open their eyes\nalways see something, in the sense of having some visual experience,\neven if what they see is only pitch black darkness or their perception\nis mistaken. The functions the Mohists ascribe to \u201cthe\nknowing\u201d overlap with those other early texts ascribe to the\nheart-mind (x\u012bn \u5fc3), a concept that plays no role\nin later Mohist thought. \n\nOne function of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is deliberation or\nforethought (lv\u0300 \u616e), which is described as a\nprocess of mentally \u201cseeking\u201d something. This may involve\nvisualizing various courses of action and identifying their benefits\nand harms, which can then be \u201cweighed\u201d\n(qu\u00e1n \u6b0a) to reach a decision on how to act. An\ninteresting difference from prominent views in the Western tradition\nis that deliberation is understood as seeking various features by\nwhich to draw a distinction between sh\u00ec \u662f and\nf\u0113i \u975e or benefit and harm. It is not conceived of\nas, for instance, running through the steps of a practical syllogism\nin one\u2019s head. Rather, extending the vision analogy, the texts\nsuggest that whereas \u201cthe knowing\u201d is comparable to\neyesight, deliberation is analogous to peering this way or that while\ntrying to spot something. \n\nAnother function of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is to know or recognize\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) things, which is explained as\n\u201ccontacting\u201d them (A5). Here the analogy is to the\neyesight veridically seeing something. The text explains this sense of\nknowledge as \u201cto know is, by means of \u2018the knowing\u2019,\npassing by something and being able to describe it.\u201d\nInterestingly, knowing is here characterized as the practical ability\n(n\u00e9ng \u80fd) to \u201cdescribe\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c) something encountered, probably by\napplying a term to it. It is not regarded as an inner mental state\nthat represents the world accurately, nor as an attitude toward a\nsentence or proposition. Technically, the ability to correctly apply a\nterm to something (such as by saying, \u201cThis is a dog\u201d or\nby pointing at a dog and declaring, \u201cDog!\u201d) can be\nunderstood as an expression of propositional knowledge. But the text\nexplains such knowledge in terms of an ability or know-how. \n\nThis passage seems to characterize knowing (zh\u012b\n\u77e5) quite narrowly, as the ability to recognize something\nencountered in perceptual experience. Elsewhere the Canons\nand Explanations use the word \u2018know\u2019\n(zh\u012b \u77e5) with a broader scope, so that it includes\ncases other than perceptual knowledge, or at least other than\nknowledge of things the knower has personally experienced. One passage\nexplains that though the senses are the source of perceptual\nknowledge, once we know something, we need not rely on the senses in\norder to continue to know it (B46). Our knowledge of\nsomething\u2014that is, our ability to describe it\u2014can remain\neven after we no longer perceive it. We can also come to know\nsomething by having it reported or explained to us without having\nperceived it ourselves (A80, B9). \n\nA third function or capacity of \u201cthe knowing\u201d is\ndiscursive knowledge, here equated with understanding (A6). This form\nof knowledge is explained as \u201cby means of \u2018the\nknowing,\u2019 sorting things [into kinds] in such a way that\none\u2019s knowing [correctly recognizing] them is obvious.\u201d\nWhereas knowing in the sense of recognition is analogous to seeing\nsomething, knowledge or understanding in the sense explained here is\nanalogous to being clear-sighted. The two are closely interrelated,\nthough the text does not make the details of the relationship entirely\n explicit.[12]\n One reasonable interpretation is that zh\u012b, or \u201cto\nknow,\u201d as described in Canon A5 is primarily a verb that refers\nto recognizing or knowing of some particular thing or another, while\nknowledge or understanding as characterized in A6 is a noun referring\nto the underlying, systematic ability to recognize and sort\n(l\u00f9n \u8ad6) or classify various things. Knowledge\n(in the sense of A6) may be the underlying skill or ability that\nenables one to know or recognize things (in the sense of A5) in\nvarious contexts. Knowing (A5) would then be an application of\nknowledge (A6). At the same time, however, knowing (A5) is in effect a\ncomponent of knowledge (A6), since the text says that the latter lies\nin being able to sort things in a way that shows one knows them,\npresumably in the sense of A5. Another passage tells us that\nknowing\u2014again, presumably in the sense of A5\u2014is the means\nby which one sorts things (B34), which is the sign of knowledge in the\nsense of A6. \n\nKnowledge or understanding (A6) seems to be the Mohist analogue to\nwhat we might call discursive or theoretical knowledge, systematic\nknowledge of various things and relations between them. But there are\ninteresting differences between the Mohist conception of such\nknowledge and conceptions prevalent in the Western tradition. The\nMohists regard the structure of such knowledge as a system of\nclassifications\u2014of relations and distinctions among various\nkinds (l\u00e8i \u985e)\u2014and not, for example, as a\ndeductive system. They do not see knowledge as having a sentential or\npropositional structure. Knowing is not a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s standing in a certain relation to a true proposition;\nindeed, their account makes no mention of beliefs, propositions, or\ntruth. Rather, knowledge or understanding is explained as a kind of\nability or know-how: the ability to use \u2018the knowing\u2019 to\n\u201csort\u201d things, which is to distinguish them into kinds and\napply the appropriate names to them. This know-how corresponds\nfunctionally to propositional knowledge, in that it will typically be\nexpressed in statements of the form \u201cA is\nB\u201d\u2014such as \u201coxen are\nanimals\u201d\u2014which by our lights express facts or true\npropositions. But the Mohists\u2019 explanation is that such a\nstatement manifests the skill or ability to \u201csort\u201d or\n\u201cdistinguish\u201d oxen as falling within the kind\nanimal.\n",
