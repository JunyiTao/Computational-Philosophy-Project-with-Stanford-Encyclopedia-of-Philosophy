    "main_text": "Classical Indian Conceptions of Persons || Worldly Persons\n1.3 Worldly Persons\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers differ from the philosophers of Advaita-Ved\u0101nta in\nthat they emphasise the reality of distinct many distinct individual\npersons (j\u012bva). However, because of their allegiance to\nthe Vedas there is not much explicit discussion of persons, the focus\nis on the search for is the essence of persons (\u0101tman)\nand their pursuit of the highest good, liberation\n(mok\u1e63a). Ordinary persons are embodied souls, according\nto these philosophers. The soul (\u0101tman) is the essence\nof the person; the mind, body and the senses are merely adjuncts. The\nsoul is a distinct and independent substance, possessing the property\nof consciousness. The philosophers belonging to\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\ntraditions, contra the spiritual philosophers, emphasized that the\nsoul is not just an experiencer but more importantly an agent \u2013\na knower and a doer and enjoyer (of karmic consequences).\nBut, one may ask how might a disembodied separate soul substance be a\ndoer and knower and enjoyer? We return this question below in the\ndiscussion of these views.\n\nThe focus of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is on the self rather\nthan the person. The individual self (j\u012bva-\u0101tma is\ntheir preferred term) occupies a central place in the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika ontology. Selves are really distinct\nindividuals and do not merge into one ultimate reality at liberation.\nMuch attention has been paid to the Ny\u0101ya arguments for the\nexistence of the self, the ways of knowing the self, the\ncharacteristics of the self and the means to liberation. Let us begin\nby noting Nya\u0304ya-su\u0304tra 1.1.10, which provides the\nfamous \u2018characteristics of the self\u2019 as well as the basis\nof the inferential proof for the existence of the self:\n\nDesire, aversion, volition (prayatna), pleasure, pain, and\ncognition are characteristics of the self. (NS 1.1.10)\n\n\nDasti writes that for Nya\u0304ya, agency is a special expression of\nthe self\u2019s different capacities and potentialities, which\ncoherently ties together all its distinctive characteristics (2013,\n114). Dasti is right to emphasise that the Ny\u0101ya self is much\nmore than a subject of experience, that it is more importantly an\nagent \u2013 a doer and a knower. But Dasti and others in\ncontemporary literature fail to emphasise that the distinctive\nqualities (vi\u015be\u1e63a) of the self, desire, cognition,\npain, etc., are transitory and come into existence only when the self\nis in contact with the mind-sense organs-body complex. The\nsubstance-quality distinction which is the hallmark of Ny\u0101ya\nontology, and an important tool that accounts for all the goods\nafforded by the Ny\u0101ya postulation of the self as distinct\nsubstance. As Dasti puts it:\n\nNya\u0304ya\u2019s account of personhood involves substances and\nproperties: an enduring substantial self with its fluctuating,\nworld-engaging properties like memory, awareness, and volition allow\nfor full personhood. Like Sa\u0304m\u0323khya, Nya\u0304ya allows for\na self which endures through time, survives bodily death, and\nparticipates in ultimate liberation. But like the Buddhists,\nNya\u0304ya\u2019s person is directly engaged in the world. We are\nhere now (2013: 135).\n\n\nDasti rightly uses the term personhood as signifying the self together\nwith its properties and talks about person (rather than the self) as\ndirectly engaged in the world, but he fails to note that the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika account is plagued with problems.\nProblems arise when we pay attention to the fact that according to the\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, although the self is a substance which is\nseparate from the mind-sense organs-body complex, the self is totally\ndependent on this complex for its functionality. The mind-sense\norgans-body contact is needed to engender cognition, desire, etc., the\nself cannot bring cognition into being by itself. Reflection and\nmemory too require the self to be in contact with the mind. Even the\neffort of the self is induced by the mind-sense-body contact, so it\nseems that the self cannot initiate any activity by itself. Self by\nitself is causally impotent (this is, indeed, exactly the Buddhist\nargument against the existence of the Ny\u0101ya self). It seems that\nthe self by itself is just a bearer of its distinctive qualities which\nare induced by mind-sense organs-body contact. It is merely the\npassive observer of activity and remote carrier of the mediate\n(karmic) consequences of actions. Therefore, it is not the\nself by itself but the embodied self or person that is the agent, doer\nand originator of all actions and the enjoyer of the results of the\naction.\n\nFurthermore, the distinctive qualities of the self are not its\nessential qualities. The self is without its qualities temporarily\nduring sleep and similar states and loses these qualities permanently\nin the state of liberation (mok\u1e63a). The self in the state of\nliberation is totally lacking in consciousness, Dravid describing it\nas \u2018an insentient stone-like condition\u2019 (1995, 1). The\nfirm separation between the self and its qualities means that even\nthough the latter are always changing, the self is totally unaffected\nby these changes. The Buddhist objects if the self remains totally\nunaffected by changes in its qualities it would not be able to\nregister the changes, that is to say that the self by itself would not\nbe able to perceive those changes (Watson, 2018, 337). This robs the\nself of its status as the cognizer (j\u00f1\u0101t\u1e5b);\nit is rather the embodied worldly self or persons that perceive. So,\nit seems that the Ny\u0101ya self by itself can\u2019t even be an\nexperiencer. To ensure that self can really live up to its job\ndescription as an agent and experiencer the Ny\u0101ya discussion\nshould have been focused on the embodied wordly self or person that is\nthe agent (kart\u1e5b), enjoyer (bh\u014dkt\u1e5b)\nand cognizer (j\u00f1\u0101t\u1e5b), rather than the\nself.\n\nMost Ny\u0101ya philosophers claim that the agential self is not\nperceived but can only be inferred from the actions of the body. The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers offer the analogy of\ninferring the driver of a chariot when you see it moving along the\nroad, avoiding potholes and other moving vehicles and persons. The\nanalogy might remind us of Descartes\u2019 analogy of a sailor in the\nship. But as Descartes pointed out in the sixth Meditation that the\nconnection between self (conceived of as the referent of\n\u2018I\u2019) and body has to be much more intimate than that of a\nsailor in the ship, otherwise the self would not feel pain when the\nbody was hurt, but would merely perceive the damage just as a sailor\nperceives by sight if his ship is broken (Cottingham, 1996, 56). The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika self in the driver\u2019s seat,\nindependent and separate from the chariot (body), doesn\u2019t quite\ndo justice to the relationship between the self and its body.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya philosophers have two options at this point. They must\ngive up on the notion of the self as a separate substance untouched by\nits qualities. The talk of the remote self needs to be replaced with\nembodied selves (or persons). Or, they need to conceive of the self in\nthe way the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 do as more\nclosely connected with its qualities, so that it can undergo\nmodification. The second option is available, but does it suffice? We\nwill revisit this question after drawing out the conception of person\nimplicit in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\n\nThe stated goal of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 is to interpret the\nstatements of the Vedas, and thus to provide specific guidance to\nHindus for performing the rituals and sacrifices they enjoin. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers agree with other Hindu\nschools that the true self that we cognize in self-recognition is a\nsingle thing that remains identical over time and thus it cannot be\nidentified with the mind, body and the sense organs (See Taber 1992\nfor the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 argument for a self). There is\nnot much discussion of their notion of a person directly in the texts.\nHowever, there is implicit discussion of wordly persons in the context\nof the performance of duty (dharma) and religious rituals. A\nperson is one who performs the rituals and follows the\ndharma, the doer of the deeds and enjoyer of the fruits of\nthe deeds in accordance with the karma doctrine. Every religious\nritual or sacrifice, according to the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers, is said to have a specific result and characterized by\nan eligible persons (adhik\u0101ra) (Freschi, et al. 2019).\nThe eligibility identifies the person who is enjoined by the Vedas to\nperform a religious ritual or sacrifice, has the means to perform it\nand will be the bearer of the karmic result accrued on\naccount of the performance. This is particularly relevant in the\ncontext of Vedic sacrifices, since they always include many\nperformers. An eligible person (adhik\u0101rin) is the one\nwho is enjoined by the Vedas to perform the sacrifice and entitled to\nits result; the former implies that one can hear or read a Vedic\ninjunction and understand oneself as the addressee, which, in turn,\nimplies that one belongs to one of the social groups that is\ntraditionally expected to study the Vedas. Being eligible further\nimplies having physical ability (see Exegetic Aphorisms\n6.1.42) and material resources (Exegetic Aphorisms\n6.7.18\u201320) to organize the performance of a sacrifice (Freschi,\net al. 2019). The latter, the entitlement to the result of the\nsuccessful performance of a sacrifice is automatically guaranteed by\nthe law of karma. This notion of a person implicit in this discussion\nof injunctions by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers suggests\nthat persons are embodied beings, belonging to a certain social class,\npossessing material wealth or otherwise, the bearers of\nkarmic residues and the enjoyers of karmic\nresults.\n\nThe Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, specifically\nKum\u0101rila, argues that the self can undergo transformation even\nthough it is eternal. Pleasure, pain etc. are qualities of the self,\nchanges in these qualities entail a change in the self, but it is mere\nqualitative change. The self can be transformed but it remains\nnumerically identical through the change in its qualities. Some\naspects of the self are permanent, for example its consciousness,\nexistence and substantiality, but other aspects such as pleasure, pain\netc. undergo change. The self, Kum\u0101rila says, can be compared to\na piece of gold that can be remoulded into a necklace or earrings or a\ngold coin. The stuff of which the self is composed is eternal, just\nlike the eternal gold atoms. The self can change, but to count as the\nsame self there can be no change in whatsoever in its essence, it must\nremain the very same substance. In this sense, the self remains a pure\nsubject untainted by physicality. The Vedic assumption that the self\nis a separate soul substance is difficult to square with the\nconception of the self as cognizer, agent and the enjoyer. The Hindu\nphilosophers who want to maintain this conception must reject the\nassumption of an eternal separate soul substance. An embodied self or\nperson, by contrast, is a more suitable candidate for it can be the\ncognizer and characterized by agency and by enjoyment.\n",
