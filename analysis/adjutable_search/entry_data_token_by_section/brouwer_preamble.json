    "main_text": "\n\n\nDutch mathematician and philosopher who lived from 1881 to 1966. He is\ntraditionally referred to as \u201cL.E.J. Brouwer\u201d, with full\ninitials, but was called \u201cBertus\u201d by his friends. \n\n\n\nIn classical mathematics, he founded modern topology by\nestablishing, for example, the topological invariance of dimension and\nthe fixpoint theorem. He also gave the first correct definition of\ndimension.\n\n\nIn philosophy, his brainchild is intuitionism, a revisionist\nfoundation of mathematics. Intuitionism views mathematics as a free\nactivity of the mind, independent of any language or Platonic realm of\nobjects, and therefore bases mathematics on a philosophy of mind. The\nimplications are twofold. First, it leads to a form of constructive\nmathematics, in which large parts of classical mathematics are\nrejected. Second, the reliance on a philosophy of mind introduces\nfeatures that are absent from classical mathematics as well as from\nother forms of constructive mathematics: unlike those, intuitionistic\nmathematics is not a proper part of classical mathematics.\n",
