It\nis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.\n The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same\neffect never arises but from the same cause. This Principle we derive\nfrom experience, and is the source of most of our philosophical\nreasonings. For when by any clear experiment we have discovered the\ncauses or effects of any phaenomenon, we immediately extend our\nobservation to every phenomenon of the same kind, without waiting for\nthat constant repetition, from which the first idea of this relation\nis derived.\n There is another principle, which hangs upon this, viz. that\nwhere several different objects produce the same effect, it must be by\nmeans of some quality, which we discover common amongst them. For as\nlike effects imply like causes, we must always ascribe the causation\nto the circumstance, wherein we discover the resemblance.\n The following principle is founded on the same reason. The\ndifference in the effects of two resembling objects must proceed from\nthat particular, in which they differ. For as like causes always\nproduce like effects, when in any instance we find our expectation to\nbe disappointed, we must conclude that this irregularity proceeds from\nsome difference in the causes.\n When any object encreases or diminishes with the encrease or\ndiminution of its cause, it is to be regarded as a compounded effect,\nderived from the union of the several different effects, which arise\nfrom the several different parts of the cause. The absence or presence\nof one part of the cause is here supposed to be always attended with\nthe absence or presence of a proportionable part of the effect. This\nconstant conjunction sufficiently proves, that the one part is the\ncause of the other. We must, however, beware not to draw such a\nconclusion from a few experiments. A certain degree of heat gives\npleasure; if you diminish that heat, the pleasure diminishes; but it\ndoes not follow, that if you augment beyond a certain degree, the\npleasure will likewise augment; for we find that it degenerates into\npain.\n The eight and last rule I shall take notice of is, that an\nobject, which exists for any time in its full perfection without any\neffect, is not the sole cause of that effect, but requires to be\nassisted by some other principle, which may forward its influences and\noperation. For as like effects necessarily follow from like causes,\nand in a contiguous time and place, their separation for a moment\nshews, that these causes are not compleat ones. (THN 1.3.15)\n\n\n\nIn Treatise 1.3.15, Hume states eight \u201crules by which\nto judge of causes and effects\u201d (see the block-quote above)\nbecause it is \u201cpossible for all objects to become causes or\neffects to each other\u201d. The source of these rules is ambiguous.\nAlthough they \u201cmight have been supply\u2019d by the natural\nprinciples of our understanding\u201d (THN 1.3.15.11), Hume provides\nno evidence for this. Nevertheless, Hume thinks it is\n\u201cproper\u201d to employ them in his \u201creasoning\u201d\n(THN 1.3.15.11; 1.3.15.2). Earlier in the Treatise, he was even more\nadamant about the regulative character of these rules: \n\n\nWe shall afterwards take notice of some general rules, by which we\nought to regulate our judgment concerning causes and effects; and\nthese rules are form\u2019d on the nature of our understanding, and\non our experience of its operations in the judgments we form\nconcerning objects. (emphasis added, THN 1.3.13.11; see de Pierris 2001) \n\n\nSo, while these rules may be derived from reflection on how our minds\nwork or some may be derived \u201cfrom experience\u201d (THN\n1.3.15.6), they prescribe how we should ascribe causes to\n\u201cobjects\u201d in the world, especially in \u201cmost of our\nphilosophical reasonings\u201d. But on Hume\u2019s definition of a\ncause (rules 1\u20133), rules 4\u20138 are at most useful\nstipulations (Hume uses \u201cto fix\u201d at THN 1.3.15.2) that\nhelp one identify causal relations. This is not the place to resolve\nhow Hume is entitled to the normative character of these rules (see\nMartin 1993). Now we examine these rules and their debt to\nNewton\u2019s.\n\nThe first three rules define what it is to be cause and effect: as we\nhave seen, they must be contiguous in space and time; the cause must\nbe a prior to the effect; there must a constant union between cause\nand effect (THN 1.3.15.3\u20135). With the exception of these first\nthree (see\n section 4.4),\n Hume\u2019s rules of reasoning have a strong resemblance to\nNewton\u2019s four \u201cRules for the Study of Natural\nPhilosophy\u201d outlined at the start of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia (third edition). For example, Hume\u2019s fourth\nrule, \u201cThe same cause always produces the same effect, and the\nsame effect never arises but from the same cause\u201d, is explained\nby \n\n\n[F]or when by any clear experiment I have discover\u2019d the causes\nor effects of any ph\u00e6nomenon, I immediately extend our\nobservation to every phenomenon of the same kind. \n\n\nThis echoes Newton\u2019s second rule of\n reasoning,[5]\n especially in its generalizing tendency, which Newton explicitly\nasserts in his third\n rule.[6]\n That is to say, in his fourth rule, Hume makes explicit what is\nimplied by the simplicity of nature assumption in Newton\u2019s first\n rule:[7]\n that the same cause always produces the same effect. Also,\nHume\u2019s fifth rule is an articulation of Newton\u2019s first and\nthird rules. Hume\u2019s sixth rule is itself an extension of\nHume\u2019s fifth.\n\nHume\u2019s seventh and eighth rules do not directly echo\nNewton\u2019s four rules. Hume admits, however, that one should be\ncautious in applying and extending the seventh rule because one cannot\nextrapolate from a \u201cfew experiments\u201d (THN 1.3.15.9; he\nappeals to the rule at 2.2.8.4). The example Hume offers (on the\nrelationship between heat and pleasure/pain) is about a mental\nphenomenon. Even so we think there is an important critical\nrelationship between Hume\u2019s Rule VII and Newtonian gravitation\n(what follows is taken over from Hazony & Schliesser 2016). This\nrelationship is not explicit in his text, it is established by\nHume\u2019s wording, which closely follows Newton\u2019s phrasing in\ndiscussing gravity in the Principia: In his Book 3,\nProposition 7, Corollary 1, Newton describes gravitation as an action\nin which \u201cevery attraction toward a whole arises from the\nattractions toward the individual parts\u201d. In Rule VII, Hume\nspeaks in these same terms, arguing that a quality that\n\u201cencreases or diminishes with the encrease or diminution of its\ncause\u201d, should be \u201cregarded as a compounded effect,\nderiv\u2019d from the union of the several different effects, which\narise from the several different parts of the cause\u201d. And,\nelsewhere in the Treatise, Hume writes explicitly of the\nforce of gravitation using just this language (THN 1.3.2.16). On the\nface of it, then, Hume\u2019s Rule VII seems to adopt Newtonian\nlanguage in order to provide an alternative description of the kind of\nextrapolation involved in establishing Newtonian gravitation.\n\nBut only the first half of Rule VII is compatible with Newton\u2019s\nscience. In the latter half, Hume turns against Newton, warning\nagainst the attempt to \u201cdraw such a conclusion from a few\nexperiments\u201d (THN 1.3.15.9). Indeed, we know quite well that\neffects can vary proportionately within a certain range of experience\nand yet behave completely differently outside of this range. Hume\ngives the example of our experience of fire. \n\n\nA certain degree of heat gives pleasure; if you diminish that heat,\nthe pleasure diminishes; but it does not follow, that if you augment\nit beyond a certain degree, the pleasure will likewise augment; for we\nfind that it degenerates into pain. \n\n\nThis argument, made with respect to heat, is no less applicable to the\nNewtonian force of gravitation: what appears to be a strictly\nproportional relation over a given range of experience can turn into\nsomething quite different when one strays from this range.\n\nWhat we have, therefore, is as follows. Newton\u2019s Rule III, which\nis the basis for the claimed universality for his law of gravitation,\nis met and replaced by Hume\u2019s Rule VII, whose intent is in a\ncertain sense precisely the opposite: The so-called universal law of\ngravitation must be regarded only as characterizing a certain range of\nhuman experience and no more. Extension of this law beyond our\nexperience (or beyond what \u201cperceptible models\u201d allow for,\nsee Landy 2017), whether into the heavens or the microworld, cannot be\nadmitted into science (except as \u201chypothesis\u201d). And the\nsame will have to be said for all other qualities that are attributed\nto bodies significantly outside of the bounds of our actual\nexperience. What to Newton is nothing less than the \u201cfoundation\nof all natural philosophy\u201d\u2014his Rule III\u2014is in\nHume\u2019s philosophy shown to be unnecessary for scientific\nreasoning and of questionable validity.\n\nThis suggests that it is Newton\u2019s Rule II that Hume considers to\nbe \u201cNewton\u2019s chief rule of philosophizing\u201d\u2014an\ninterpretation that fits well with what Hume writes about method in\nboth the Treatise and in his later writings. It also\nreinforces the view that Hume rejects Rule III as being that part of\nNewton\u2019s philosophy that is worthy of being adopted and\nimitated. Indeed, Hume\u2019s point is precisely that it is\nNewton\u2019s Rule II, chiefly, that we should be interested in. Rule\nIII, with its extravagant claims concerning the presence of supposedly\nessential qualities in every body in the universe far from common life\nis one we can afford to set aside. The view we have presented here is\nat odds with that of Graciela de Pierris, who builds her discussion of\nHume\u2019s debt to Newton around Hume\u2019s putative embrace of\nNewton\u2019s Rule III as the cornerstone for his philosophical\nmethod (de Pierris 2006:\n306\u2013310, 312; for detailed criticism see Hazony & Schliesser\n2016).\n\nHume\u2019s eighth rule is, as Hume himself implies, a refinement of\nHume\u2019s fourth rule; it prevents over-zealous causal ascription\nto an object. (In his explanation of the rule, Hume presupposes the\nspatial and temporal contiguity requirement of cause and effect, but\nit is not an essential feature of the rule.) But the first part of it\n(\u201can object, which exists for any time in its full perfection\nwithout any effect\u201d) appears to target non-Newtonian theological\nor Spinozistic arguments, so will not be discussed here.\n\nOn Hume\u2019s interpretation, Newton\u2019s second rule is the only\nrule that is said to be derived (un-controversially) \u201cfrom\nexperience\u201d (THN 1.3.15.6). It is a crucial rule because the\nfifth and sixth rules are, by Hume\u2019s lights, extensions of the\nfourth (THN 1.3.15.7\u20138). Moreover, the conjunction of\nHume\u2019s fourth and seventh rules produces a new rule: \u201cAn\neffect always holds proportion with its cause\u201d (\u201cOf\nInterest\u201d, EMPL 297). We can call this Hume\u2019s ninth rule.\nIf one assumes (or prescribes) that linear causal relationships are\nthe only possible ones, this new rule allows Hume to rule out\ncompeting claims that posit the existence of causal relationships that\nare not \u201cproportional\u201d. Hume can use the rule as a\nconstraint on theory. It plays a prominent role in Hume\u2019s\npolitical economy when he rejects Mercantilism and, more important for\nour present purposes, in his criticism of the use of analogy in the\nNewtonian argument from Design (see EHU XI, and Dialogues\nParts V\u2013VII).\n\nHume\u2019s ninth rule also has Newtonian debts. Since the time of\nAristotle, many philosophers have asserted proportionality between\ncause and effect in one fashion or another. Hume\u2019s ninth rule\nechoes, for instance, a principle Leibniz uses quite frequently: the\nprinciple of the equality of cause and effect. It is the basis of\narguments Leibniz gives for his conservation principles (e.g.,\nSpecimen Dynamicum). But Leibniz\u2019s formulation is in terms of\nequality and not proportionality. Unlike Leibniz and other Cartesians,\nNewton preferred to reason in terms of proportionality. Although\nHume\u2019s ninth rule is not derived from any of Newton\u2019s\nofficial Rules of Reasoning, Newton does implicitly use a rule like\nHume\u2019s ninth throughout the Principia. For example, the\nimportance of a proportion between cause and effect is emphasized\nthroughout the treatment of the behavior of bodies in resisting fluids\n(e.g., the Scholium to Proposition 40, Book 2, Section 7, especially\nExperiment 14), which, given the importance, for Hume, of treating\nmoney as a fluid (\u201cOf the Balance of Trade\u201d, EMPL\n312\u2013315; see Schabas 2001) may have caught Hume\u2019s\nattention. Hume also treats resistance in his footnote to the EHU,\n7.1.15. Moreover, there is a prominent place in the Principia\n(the Scholium following Proposition 69, Book I, Section 11), where\nNewton implicitly transforms a version of Hume\u2019s seventh rule\ninto Hume\u2019s ninth rule in which proportionality is emphasized.\nIn this Scholium, Newton starts employing the language and emphasizing\nthe importance of proportionality. This is not ruled out by\nNewton\u2019s own \u201crules\u201d, but it was not emphasized\nthere. This passage could have attracted Hume\u2019s attention for\ntwo reasons: it is one of the few explicit methodological passages in\nthe Principia, and it offers an account of what Newton means\nby \u201cattraction\u201d. Hume was almost certainly aware of this\npassage because the proper meaning of \u201cattraction\u201d is\ndiscussed, with explicit appeal to Newton\u2019s intentions, in\nHume\u2019s footnote to EHU 7.1.25. Hume makes the ninth rule\nexplicit and uses it as a constraint with which competing theories (in\npolitical economy, the argument from design, etc) can be ruled out.\nHume\u2019s use of it in his attack on the design argument is an\ninstance where Hume attacks Newton with Newtonian tools.\n\nMoreover, there are two connected, important further differences\nbetween Hume\u2019s and Newton\u2019s rules. First, Hume never quite\nendorses the universal reach implied by Newton\u2019s third rule. For\nNewton we extend the known qualities of bodies within our experimental\nreach to all bodies in the universe. While it could be compatible with\nNewton\u2019s third rule, Hume\u2019s fourth rule does not go that\nfar. There is one instance where Hume appears to accept an implication\nof Newton\u2019s rule: \u201cThe production of motion by impulse and\ngravity is an universal law, which has hitherto admitted of no\nexception\u201d (EHU 6.4). Leaving aside the fact that this would a\nvery puzzling way to express the inverse-square law, the context makes\nclear that Hume has in mind causes that \u201care entirely uniform\nand constant\u201d on Earth, not their universal reach; this is why\nin context his other examples involve the burning of fire and the\nsuffocation of every human creature by water. There is textual support\nto suspect that Hume would deny the universal scope implied by\nNewton\u2019s third rule. Hume states a \u201cmaxim\u201d in a\nfootnote to section XI of EHU which argues against inferring new\neffects from any cause only \u201cknown only by its particular\neffects\u201d. This denies Newton\u2019s strategy of making ever\nmore audacious inferences (about planetary motions, the tides, the\nshape of the Earth, comets, etc) based on the acceptance of universal\ngravity (recall Hume\u2019s treatment of Newton\u2019s methodology\nin HE, VI, 542, discussed in\n section 3).[8]\n The argument in favor of the \u201cmaxim\u201d reveals the tension\nwith Newton\u2019s third rule:\n\n\nTo say, that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the\nsame energy, which is already known from the first effects, will not\nremove the difficulty. For even granting this to be the case (which\ncan seldom be supposed), the very continuation and exertion of a like\nenergy (for it is impossible it can be absolutely the same), I say,\nthis exertion of a like energy, in a different period of space and\ntime, is a very arbitrary supposition. (EHU 11.26)\n\n\nNewton\u2019s first three rules offer a bold methodological program\nthat attempts to unify science across different periods of space and\ntime; it is a bet on the causal unity of nature. The maxim cautions\nagainst overconfidence in this regard. Hume\u2019s caution is\nprophetic because it turns out that sub-atomic entities behave very\ndifferently than macroscopic bodies. However, it is not entirely\ncertain if one should ascribe the \u201cmaxim\u201d in the footnote\nto Hume because it is offered in the voice of a \u201cfriend\u201d,\nwho is pretending to be Epicurus.\n\nSecond, Hume lacks an equivalent to Newton\u2019s Rule 4. Hume is not\nalone in ignoring rule 4. Even Reid and Priestley, who have much to\nsay about the authority of Newton\u2019s Rules of Reasoning, tend to\nignore the fourth rule (Tapper 2002). Adam Smith seems to have been\none of few eighteenth century figures to have taken it seriously\n(Schliesser 2005a and 2005b). Recall (from\n section 4.2)\n that Newton\u2019s Rule IV can be viewed as (1) an encouragement to\nfind and exploit known deviations from the regularities one has\nestablished in order to make them \u201cmore exact\u201d. (2) A\nproposal about how to treat a theory, that is, as true until proven\notherwise. Hume seems to have not appreciated the first point at all\n(Schliesser 2004). On the second point, we have seen that Hume shares\nNewton\u2019s commitment to fallibilism. But this common commitment\nalso hides an important difference between Hume and Newton which is\nconnected to the observation just made about the contrast between\nNewton\u2019s third rule and the maxim in the footnote to section XI\nof EHU. Newton\u2019s fallibilism includes commitment to the truth of\nthe propositions within one\u2019s scientific theory until it is\nproven to be false. Newton realizes that induction can never be\ncertain for all time; he does anticipate Hume in this respect. But it\nis also an expression of Newton\u2019s \u201cscientific\nnaturalism\u201d. Empirical science is authoritative until one has\nempirical reason to refine theory. This means that at any time one\nrisks the danger of going beyond one\u2019s evidence, but this is the\nmethodological price one must pay to make further progress. In his\neagerness to combat Newtonian superstition, Hume is willing to be more\ncautious.\n\nHume\u2019s omission of an equivalent rule has several implications\nfor his philosophy and its relationship to Newton\u2019s. First Hume\nreplaces the authority of natural philosophy by his own criterion, the\n\u201ccopy principle\u201d, when it comes to existence claims (see\n section 2, of the entry on Hume).\n Only the ideas that can be traced to a distinct impression will be\npermissible. Thus, Hume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d, or\n\u201ctrue philosophy\u201d, offers to evaluate the claims of\nnatural philosophy from a privileged position. This is the sense in\nwhich Hume is not a scientific naturalist.\n\nSecond, without commitment to the truth of a \u201cscientific\u201d\ntheory, Hume has conceptual elbow room for a distinction between the\nprovable, experimental claims of common life (including some parts of\nnatural philosophy) and the lesser, probable commitments of the more\nabstract parts of natural philosophy. This, too, is a result of\nHume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d. Recall (from\n section 1)\n that the Humean practitioners of \u201cmitigated scepticism\u201d\nwill not \n\n\nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations. \n\n\nThe distinction between a provable common life and the far less\nprobable parts of natural philosophy runs through all of Hume\u2019s\nmajor works. Yet, its implications for Hume\u2019s attitude toward\nNewtonian natural philosophy are not discussed until the Dialogues.\nThere, Cleanthes, the spokesperson for a Newtonian natural religion,\nattacks the Humean position:\n\n\nThey are even obliged to acknowledge, that the most abstruse and\nremote objects are those, which are best explained by philosophy.\nLight is in reality anatomized: The true system of the heavenly bodies\nis discovered and ascertained. But the nourishment of bodies by food\nis still an inexplicable mystery: The cohesion of the parts of matter\nis still incomprehensible\u2026In reality, would not a man be\nridiculous, who pretended to reject Newton\u2019s explication of the\nwonderful phenomenon of the rainbow, because that explication gives a\nminute anatomy of the rays of light; a subject, forsooth, too refined\nfor human comprehension? And what would you say to one, who having\nnothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and\nGalileo for the motion of the earth, should withhold his assent, on\nthat general principle, That these subjects were too magnificent and\nremote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of\nmankind?\u2026 In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between\nscience and common life, or between one science and another. The\narguments, employed in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and\ncontain the same force and evidence. Or if there be any difference\namong them, the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and\nnatural religion. Many principles of mechanics are founded on very\nabstruse reasoning; yet no man, who has any pretensions to science,\neven no speculative sceptic, pretends to entertain the least doubt\nwith regard to them. The Copernican system contains the most\nsurprising paradox, and the most contrary to our natural conceptions,\nto appearances, and to our very senses: yet even monks and inquisitors\nare now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it.\n(Dialogues Part I)\n\n\nCleanthes points out that if philosophy asserts the distinction\nbetween common life and science, philosophy would set itself against\nsome of the best supported parts of natural philosophy which are often\nmost removed from common life. We may naturally think that the Sun is\nin motion, but the reality behind the appearances can be very\nsurprising. Cleanthes\u2019s point is that philosophy cannot hope to\nargue against the authority of science without looking as backward as\nmonks and inquisitors (who attacked Copernicanism).\n\nFor our purposes, there are three important features in\nCleanthes\u2019s discussion. First, he claims that the same kind of\ncorrect reasoning applies to all domains. This is a very popular\nargument among religious Newtonians (e.g., Reid). So just because\nscience deals with uncommon domains and obscure topics, it can still\ncontain \u201cjust reasoning\u201d. This is, in fact, one of the\nmajor assumptions behind Hume\u2019s own Rules of Reasoning. So,\nCleanthes uses Hume\u2019s philosophy to undercut part of\nHume\u2019s anti-Newtonian strategy. Even if Philo were not bound by\nHume\u2019s philosophy (and there is no evidence he should be\nconsidered a strict spokesperson for Hume), as a defender of the\nepistemic priority of common life he has no resources to claim that\nthere is a different, correct form of reasoning for areas beyond\ncommon life. Second, if there is a debate between science and common\nlife, the advantage is with science. No skeptic, who at least pretends\nto be informed, is seriously willing to doubt the results of natural\nphilosophy. That is, by the last third of the eighteenth century\nnatural philosophy has an authoritative claim to knowledge even if it\nis founded on very uncommon, \u201cabstruse\u201d principles. Third,\nCleanthes assimilates the success of natural philosophy to theology\nand natural religion; he does not recognize a principled distinction\nbetween science and religion. If Philo attacks natural religion he\nattacks science itself. Contemporary advocates of \u201cintelligent\ndesign\u201d, who claim that it should be treated as a scientific\ntheory (see the\n entry on teleological arguments for God\u2019s existence),\n follow the same strategy as Cleanthes.\n\nInitially it seems that Cleanthes\u2019s argument is left without a\nresponse. So there appears no room for a principled difference between\ncommon life, on the one hand, and natural philosophy and natural\nreligion, on the other hand. In the remainder of the Dialogues, Philo\nmakes sure not to be thought of as attacking natural philosophy again.\nIn the context where the intellectual authority of science has become\nunchallengeable, Philo\u2019s best hope lies in driving a wedge\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion. This may explain why\nin undermining Newtonian natural religion, Philo does not draw on some\ncore elements of Hume\u2019s philosophy: the \u201ccopy\nprinciple\u201d or Hume\u2019s attack on the permissibility of final\ncauses. Rather, throughout the Dialogues, Philo offers more narrow\narguments attacking the content of natural religion. So, while in Part\nI of the Dialogues Philo has no immediate response to\nCleanthes\u2019s argument, later in the Dialogues he continues to use\nsome distinction between the secure reasoning available in common life\nand those too far removed from it. For example, by using Hume\u2019s\nninth rule, Philo is critical of the use of analogy in making claims\nabout the nature of the first cause. Philo relies on common sense to\nformulate the problem of evil\u2014if God is all powerful then he is\nresponsible for natural and moral evil (see Part XI). At the end of\nthe Dialogue, Philo is willing to grant Cleanthes \u201cthat the\ncause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote\nanalogy to human intelligence\u201d (Part XII; emphasis in\noriginal). So,\nwhile Philo is unable to draw a conclusive, principled distinction\nbetween natural philosophy and natural religion, he reduces the latter\nto a very minimal thesis.\n\nIt may, of course, be possible that by the end of his life, Hume had\nlimited his aims to removing the \u201csuperstitious\u201d elements\nin Newtonianism (recall his criticism of Newton in Section 1). Perhaps he had given up on\nclaiming the priority of the science of man over natural philosophy.\nBut it would be a mistake to identify the posthumous Dialogues as\nHume\u2019s final, definitive philosophy. Hume appended an\n\u201cadvertisement\u201d to EHU, which was printed at the start of\nthe posthumous 1777 edition. After distancing himself (to some degree)\nfrom his \u201cjuvenile work\u201d, the Treatise, he says\nabout EHU: \u201cHenceforth, the Author desires, that the following\nPieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical\nsentiments and principles\u201d. EHU contains, of course,\nHume\u2019s copy principle and the attack on final causes. Perhaps,\nthe closing remarks of Philo, where he apologizes for \n\n\nintervening in the education and instruction of his [i.e.,\nCleanthes\u2019s] pupil [i.e., Pamphillus\u2014the official narrator\nof (and witness to) the dialogues among Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea],\n\n\n\nshould be taken more seriously by more of Hume\u2019s readers. The\nDialogues are Hume\u2019s efforts to educate the students of natural\nreligion; they are not a statement of Hume\u2019s positive\n\u201cscience of man\u201d or \u201ctrue metaphysics\u201d.\n",
