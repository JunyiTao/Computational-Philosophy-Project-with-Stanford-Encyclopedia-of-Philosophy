    "main_text": "Decision theory || Decision weights\n6.1 Decision weights\n\nDecision theory has traditionally had a predilection for\nconsequentialism, whose structure is suitable for most formal models of\ndecision-making. The standard decision-theoretical approach to risk is\nmaximization of expected utility, which can be seen as a smooth\nextension of (act) utilitarianism. In expected utility theory, the value associated with an uncertain situation is equal to the sum of the probability-weighted values of all its possible outcomes. Let \\(p\\) be a function that assigns probabilities to outcomes, and \\(u\\) a function that assigns values to them. Then the value associated with a situation with three possible outcomes \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\) and \\(x_3\\), is equal to\n\n\\[p(x_1) \\cdot u(x_1) + p(x_2) \\cdot u(x_2)+ p(x_3) \\cdot u(x_3).\\]\n\n\nHowever, influential proposals have been made for alternative decision\nrules. There are two major types of justification for such endeavours.\nFirst, examples have been put forward in which it would seem\nimplausible to claim that expected utility maximization is the only\nnormatively reasonable decision rule (Allais 1953; Ellsberg 1961).\nSecondly, numerous psychological experiments have shown that human\ndecision-makers tend to deviate substantially from expected utility\nmaximization. The first type of justification puts the normative\nsoundness of expected utility in question, where the second exposes\nits shortcomings as a descriptive model. \n\nIn an important class of alternative decision rules, the probabilities\nused in expected utility calculations are replaced by some other\nnumbers (\u201cdecision weights\u201d). This approach was proposed\nby William Fellner (1961). In most of these constructions, all\nprobabilities are transformed by some transformation function\nr. Instead maximizing the standard expected utility\n\n\\[p(x) \\cdot u(x)\\]\n the agent will then maximize \n\\[r(p(x)) \\cdot\nu(x)\\]\n\n\nSeveral decision rules with this structure have been proposed. One of\nthe earliest was Handa (1977). Currently, the best known proposal in\nthis tradition is prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky\nand Kahneman 1986), which was developed in order to describe\nobservations from psychological decision experiments more accurately\nthan in expected utility theory. Prospect theory a is a fairly complex\ntheory that also deviates in other ways from expected utility theory.\nThe traditional focus on outcomes is replaced by a focus on losses and\ngains, which are treated asymmetrically. (See also Section 7.3.)\n\nA problem with the function \\(r\\), as defined above, is that the\ntransformed probabilities which it gives rise to will not add up to 1\nexcept in the trivial case when r is the identity function\n(Fishburn 1978). To solve this problem, Quiggin (1982) introduced the\nrule of maximizing anticipated utility (also called utility\nwith rank dependent probabilities). Instead of replacing \\(p(x)\\) by a\nfunction of the individual probability, \\(r(p(x))\\), he replaced it by\na function that also depends on the other probabilities and utilities\ninvolved in the problem. The outcomes are first ordered from worst to\nbest, which results in a vector \\(\\langle x_1, x_2 ,\\ldots ,\nx_n\\rangle\\) of outcomes, such that \\(u(x_1) \\leq u(x_2) \\leq \\ldots\n\\leq u(x_n)\\). A decision weight can then be assigned to each outcome,\ntaking into account both its probability and its position in the\nranked sequence of outcomes. Since the decision-weight can be\ndifferent for outcomes with the same probability, Fishburn\u2019s\ntrivialization result does not apply here. There is evidence\nindicating that rank-dependent utility models may be more empirically\nadequate than prospect theory (Harrison and Ross 2017).\n\nOther models have been proposed that replace the probabilities in\nexpected utility maximization by some other type of decision weight\n(Gilboa and Schmeidler 1994; Buchak 2014).\n",
