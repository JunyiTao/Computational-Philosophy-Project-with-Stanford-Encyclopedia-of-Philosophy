Arguments for the Correspondence Theory\n\n\nThe main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence\ntheory of truth is its obviousness. Descartes: \u201cI have never had\nany doubts about truth, because it seems a notion so transcendentally\nclear that nobody can be ignorant of it...the word\n\u2018truth\u2019, in the strict sense, denotes the conformity of\nthought with its object\u201d (1639, AT II 597). Even philosophers\nwhose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to\nagree. Kant: \u201cThe nominal definition of truth, that it is the\nagreement of [a cognition] with its object, is assumed as\ngranted\u201d (1787, B82). William James: \u201cTruth, as any\ndictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It\nmeans their \u2018agreement\u2019, as falsity means their\ndisagreement, with \u2018reality\u2019\u201d (1907,\np. 96). Indeed, The Oxford English Dictionary tells us:\n\u201cTruth, n. Conformity with fact; agreement with\nreality\u201d.\n\n\nIn view of its claimed obviousness, it would seem interesting to learn\nhow popular the correspondence theory actually is. There are some\nempirical data. The PhilPapers Survey (conducted in 2009;\ncf. Bourget and Chalmers 2014), more specifically, the part of the\nsurvey targeting all regular faculty members in 99 leading departments\nof philosophy, reports the following responses to the question:\n\u201cTruth: correspondence, deflationary, or epistemic?\u201d\nAccept or lean toward: correspondence 50.8%; deflationary 24.8%; other\n17.5%; epistemic 6.9%. The data suggest that correspondence-type\ntheories may enjoy a weak majority among professional philosophers and\nthat the opposition is divided. This fits with the observation that\ntypically, discussions of the nature of truth take some version of the\ncorrespondence theory as the default view, the view to be criticized\nor to be defended against criticism.\n\n\nHistorically, the correspondence theory, usually in an object-based\nversion, was taken for granted, so much so that it did not acquire\nthis name until comparatively recently, and explicit arguments for the\nview are very hard to find. Since the (comparatively recent) arrival\nof apparently competing approaches, correspondence theorists have\ndeveloped negative arguments, defending their view against objections\nand attacking (sometimes ridiculing) competing views.\n",
