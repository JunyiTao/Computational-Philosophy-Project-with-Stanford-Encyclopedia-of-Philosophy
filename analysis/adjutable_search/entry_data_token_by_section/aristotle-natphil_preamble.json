    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle had a lifelong interest in the study of nature. He\ninvestigated a variety of different topics, ranging from general\nissues like motion, causation, place and time, to systematic\nexplorations and explanations of natural phenomena across different\nkinds of natural entities. These different inquiries are integrated\ninto the framework of a single overarching enterprise describing the\ndomain of natural entities. Aristotle provides the general theoretical\nframework for this enterprise in his Physics, a treatise\nwhich divides into two main parts, the first an inquiry into nature\n(books 1\u20134) and the second a treatment of motion (books\n 5\u20138).[1]\n In this work, Aristotle sets out the conceptual apparatus for his\nanalysis, provides definitions of his fundamental concepts, and argues\nfor specific theses about motion, causation, place and time, and\nestablishes in bk. 8 the existence of the unmoved mover of the\nuniverse, a supra-physical entity, without which the physical domain\ncould not remain in existence. He takes up problems of special\ninterest to physics (such as the problem of generation and perishing)\nin a series of further physical treatises, some of which are devoted\nto particular physical domains: the De generatione et corruptione\n(On Generation and Perishing), the De caelo (On the\n Heavens),[2]\n and the Meteorology, which lead up to the treatises on\nbiology and\n psychology.[3]\n\nThe science of physics, Aristotle stresses, contains almost all there\nis to know about the world. Were there no separate\nforms\u2014entities such as the unmoved mover at the pinnacle of the\ncosmos\u2014which are without matter and are not part of the physical\nworld, physics would be what Aristotle calls first philosophy\n(Metaphysics 6.1, 1026a27\u201331). As there are such\nseparate entities, physics is dependent on these, and is only a second\nphilosophy (Metaphysics 7.11, 1037a14f). Nevertheless, the\ninteraction between these two \u201cphilosophies\u201d is not\ncompletely exhausted by the causal influence exerted on the world by\nthe supra-physical entities\u2014the prime movers as it turns out.\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics and physics use a common conceptual\nframework, and they often address similar issues. The prime and\ndistinctive task of first philosophy is an inquiry into first\nentities; these, however, are not perceptible entities, and as a\nresult they have to be investigated through a metaphysical\ninvestigation of physical entities. Hence the overlap between the two\ndisciplines, which often verges on inseparability.\n",
