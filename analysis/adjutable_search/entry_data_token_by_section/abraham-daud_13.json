    "main_text": "The Reception of Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nAbraham ibn Daud\u2019s importance lies in the fact that he was the\nfirst to present a coherent systematic interpretation of Judaism\nin light of the new challenge, namely Muslim Aristotelianism. The\nsustained use of Aristotelian doctrines and logical reasoning clearly\ndistinguishes ER from the writings of earlier Jewish\nphilosophers. Moreover, the manner in which he incorporates his Muslim\n(and to a lesser extent) Jewish sources in a carefully structured\nsystem in order to solve a religious problem is noteworthy. His thought\ndevelops along the following lines: substance\u2014form \u2013\nmotion and transition from potentiality into actuality\u2014soul\n\u2013 God\u2014intelligences\u2014prophet\u2014freedom of\nthe will\u2014correspondence between correct knowledge and correct\nconduct\u2014perfection.\n\n\nNonetheless, it should be noted that Ibn Daud\u2019s thought\ncontains a number of \u201cloose ends\u201d; the promised harmony\nbetween religion and philosophy is certainly not always achieved. Cases\nin point are his ambiguous position with regard to the origin and\nstatus of matter and the way in which he skirts around the issue of\ncreation versus emanation. The inconsistencies and undetermined issues\nin ER are partly the result of the influence of neo-Platonism.\nThe Aristotelianism of the Muslim peripatetics still contains an\nappreciable number of neo-Platonic notions that have made an impact on\nIbn Daud. Arfa\u2019s evaluation of Ibn Daud\u2019s philosophic\nactivity \u201cat the point where it has rejected neo-Platonism but\nhas not yet freed itself of many of its fundamental doctrines and\nthought habits, and on the other hand has espoused Aristotelianism but\nhas not yet assimilated the full meaning of its world outlook\u201d\nhits the nail right on the head (Arfa 1954: 4).\nFor another part, the flaws in Ibn Daud\u2019s thought are due to his\nconception of philosophical knowledge as the foundation on which\nreligion should be built. For all the importance he attaches to the use\nof philosophical speculation, his bias is religious, which is why he\nprefers to remain vague about or to omit Aristotelian doctrines like\nthe eternity of motion. When harmony between religion and philosophy\nseems to be impossible, Ibn Daud shrinks from accepting the\nconsequences of Aristotle\u2019s doctrines and instead chooses to seek\nrefuge in the limitations of the human intellect, claiming that the\nphilosophers tend to overreach themselves. The weaknesses in his\nthought notwithstanding, Ibn Daud\u2019s significance for the\ndevelopment of Jewish philosophy can hardly be underestimated.\n",
