    "main_text": "Basic Quotational Features || Guiding Questions for Theories of Quotation\n2.1 Guiding Questions for Theories of Quotation\n\nBQ1\u2013BQ6 play an important role because theories of quotation are\nattempts to answer certain questions, and those questions won\u2019t\nhave satisfactory answers unless BQ1\u2013BQ6 are accounted for.\nThree questions can be thought of as the guiding questions for a\ntheory of quotation:\n\nQ1. In a quotation, what does the referring? There are three\noptions:\n\n\nThe quotation marks\nThe expression between the quotation marks\nA complex of the expression and the quotation marks\n\n\n\nAlternatively, one might hold that quotations fail to refer at all,\nbut rather that speakers refer contingent upon the intentions with\nwhich they use an expression\u2014with or without quotation\nmarks.\n\nQ2. How do quotations refer?\n\nAre they names, descriptions, demonstratives, functors or some sui\ngeneris linguistic category?\n\nIn addition to Q1 and Q2, theories of quotation often try answer a\nthird question:\n\nQ3. What do quotations refer to?\n\nWhat kinds of objects are picked out? Is it always the same object or\nare quotations\n ambiguous?[4]\n\nOur primary focus in what follows will be in Q1 and Q2, but along the\nway we will also address Q3.\n (Section 5\n is entirely devoted to Q3.)\n",
