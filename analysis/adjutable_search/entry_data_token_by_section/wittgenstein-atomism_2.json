    "main_text": "Linguistic Atomism || Wittgenstein\u2019s Early Conception of Analysis\n2.1 Wittgenstein\u2019s Early Conception of Analysis\n\nA remark from the Philosophical Grammar, written in 1936,\nthrows light on how Wittgenstein had earlier conceived of the process\nof analysis: \n\nFormerly, I myself spoke of a \u2018complete analysis,\u2019 and I\nused to believe that philosophy had to give a definitive dissection of\npropositions so as to set out clearly all their connections and remove\nall possibilities of misunderstanding. I spoke as if there was a\ncalculus in which such a dissection would be possible. I vaguely had\nin mind something like the definition that Russell had given for the\ndefinite article (PG, 211).\n\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Russell\u2019s definition is that\nit treats the expression \u201cthe x such that\nFx\u201d as an \u201cincomplete symbol.\u201d Such symbols\nhave no meaning in isolation but are given meaning by contextual\ndefinitions that treat of the sentential contexts in which they occur\n(cf. PM, 66). Incomplete symbols do, of course, have\nmeaning because they make a contribution to the meanings of the\nsentences in which they occur (cf. Principles, Introduction,\nx). What is special about them is that they make this contribution\nwithout expressing a propositional constituent. (For more on the\nnature of incomplete symbols, see Pickel 2013)\n\nRussell\u2019s definition is contained in the following clauses (For\nthe sake of expository transparency, his scope-indicating devices are\nomitted.).\n\n\n[1] G(the x: Fx) =\n\u2203x(\u2200y(Fy\u2194y=x)\n& Gx) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1905b; Russell 1990, 173) \n\n[2] (the x: Fx) exists =\n\u2203x\u2200y(Fy\u2194y=x)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1990, 174)\n\n\nThe fact that existence is dealt with by a separate definition shows\nthat Russell means to treat the predicate \u2018exists\u2019 as\nitself an incomplete symbol. \n\nOne can understand why Wittgenstein should have taken there to be an\naffinity between the theory of descriptions and his own envisioned\n\u201ccalculus,\u201d for one can extract from his remarks in the\nTractatus and elsewhere two somewhat parallel proposals for\neliminating what he calls terms for \u201ccomplexes\u201d: \n\n[3] F[aRb] iff Fa & Fb &\naRb\n\n\n[4] [aRb] exists iff aRb\n\n\nClauses [1] to [4] share the feature that any sentence involving\napparent reference to an individual is treated as false rather than as\nneither true nor false if that individual should be discovered not to\nexist. \n\nWittgenstein\u2019s first contextual definition \u2014 our [3]\n\u2014 occurs in a Notebooks entry from 1914 (NB,\n4), but it is also alluded to in the Tractatus: \n\nEvery statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about\ntheir constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely\ndescribe the complexes (2.0201).\n\n\nIn [3] the statement \u201cabout [the complex\u2019s] constituent\nparts\u201d is \u201cFa & Fb,\u201d while the\nproposition which \u201ccompletely describes\u201d the complex is\n\u201caRb.\u201d If the propositions obtained by applying\n[3] and [4] are to be further analysed, a two-stage procedure will be\nnecessary: first, the apparent names generated by the analysis \u2014\nin the present case \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 \u2014 will need to be\n replaced[3]\n with symbols that are overtly terms for complexes, e.g.,\n\u2018[cSd]\u2019 and \u2018[eFg];\u2019 second,\nthe contextual definitions [3] and [4] will need to be applied again\nto eliminate these terms. If there is going to be a unique final\nanalysis, each apparent name will have to be uniquely paired\nwith a term for a complex. So the program of analysis at which\nWittgenstein gestures, in addition to committing him to something\nanalogous to Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions, also commits him\nto the analogue of Russell\u2019s \u201cdescription theory of\nordinary names\u201d (cf. Russell 1905a). The latter is the idea that\nevery apparent name not occurring at the end of analysis is equivalent\nin meaning to some definite description. \n\nWittgenstein\u2019s first definition, like Russell\u2019s, strictly\nspeaking, stands in need of a device for indicating scope, for\notherwise it would be unclear how to apply the analysis when we\nchoose, say, \u201c~G\u201d as our instance of\n\u201cF.\u201d In such a case the question would arise\nwhether the resulting instance of [3] is [5]:\n\u201c~G[aRb] = ~Ga & ~Gb\n& aRb,\u201d which corresponds to giving the term for a\ncomplex wide scope with respect to the negation operator, or whether\nit is: [6] \u201c~G[aRb] = ~[Ga &\nGb & aRb],\u201d which corresponds to giving\nthe term for a complex narrow scope. One suspects that\nWittgenstein\u2019s intention would most likely have been to follow\nRussell\u2019s convention of reading the logical operator as having\nnarrow scope unless the alternative is expressly indicated (cf.\nPM, 172). \n\nDefinition [3] has obvious flaws. While it may work for such\npredicates as \u201cx is located in England,\u201d it\nobviously fails for certain others, e.g., \u201cx is greater\nthan three feet long\u201d and \u201cx weighs exactly four\npounds.\u201d This problem can hardly have escaped Wittgenstein; so\nit seems likely that he would have regarded his proposals merely as\ntentative illustrations, open to supplementation and refinement.\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein\u2019s second contextual definition \u2014 our\n[4] \u2014 does not occur in the Tractatus, it is implied by\na remark from the Notes on Logic that seems to anticipate\n2.0201: \n\nEvery proposition which seems to be about a complex can be analysed\ninto a proposition about its constituents and \u2026 the proposition\nwhich describes the complex perfectly; i.e., that proposition\nwhich is equivalent to saying the complex exists (NB,\n93; emphasis\n added)[4]\n\n\nSince the proposition that \u201cdescribes the complex,\u201d\n[aRb], \u201cperfectly\u201d is just the proposition that\naRb, Wittgenstein\u2019s clarifying addendum amounts to the\nclaim that the proposition \u201caRb\u201d is equivalent to\nthe proposition \u201c[aRb] exists.\u201d And this\nequivalence is just our [4].\n\nIt turns out, then, that existence is defined only in contexts in\nwhich it is predicated of complexes. Wittgenstein proposal thus\nmirrors Russell\u2019s in embodying the idea that it makes no sense\nto speak of the existence of immediately given (that is, named)\nsimples (cf. PM, 174\u20135). This is why Wittgenstein was\nlater to refer to his \u201cobjects\u201d as \u201cthat for which\nthere is neither existence nor non-existence\u201d (PR, 72).\nHis view seems to be that when \u2018a\u2019 is a\nTractarian name, what we try to say by uttering the nonsense string\n\u201ca exists\u201d will, strictly speaking, be\nshown by the fact that the final analysis of some proposition\ncontains \u2018a\u2019 (cf. 5.535). But of course, the\nTractatus does not always speak strictly. Indeed, what is\ngenerally taken to be the ultimate conclusion of the\nTractatus\u2019s so-called \u201cArgument for\nSubstance\u201d (2.021\u20132.0211) itself tries to say something\nthat can only be shown, since it asserts the existence of\nobjects. The sharpness of the tension here is only partly disguised by\nthe oblique manner in which the conclusion is formulated. Instead of\narguing for the existence of objects, the Tractatus argues\nfor the thesis that the world \u201chas substance.\u201d However,\nbecause \u201cobjects constitute the substance of the world\u201d\n(2.021), and because substance is that which exists\nindependently of what is the case (2.024), this is tantamount to\nsaying that objects exist. So it seems that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nargument for substance must be regarded as a part of the ladder we are\nsupposed to throw away (6.54). But having acknowledged this point, we\nshall set it aside as peripheral to our main concerns. \n\nThe most obvious similarity between the two sets of definitions is\nthat each seeks to provide for the elimination of what purport to be\nsemantically complex referring expressions. The most obvious\ndifference consists in the fact that Wittgenstein\u2019s definitions\nare designed to eliminate not definite descriptions, but rather terms\nfor complexes, for example the expression\n\u201c[aRb],\u201d which, judging by remarks in the\nNotebooks, is to be read: \u201ca in the relation R to\nb\u201d (NB, 48) (This gloss seems to derive from\nRussell\u2019s manner of speaking of complexes in Principia\nMathematica, where examples of terms for complexes include, in\naddition to \u201ca in the relation R to\nb,\u201d \u201ca having the quality\nq\u201d, and \u201ca and b and c\nstanding in the relation S\u201d (PM, 44).). One\nmight wonder why this difference should exist. That is to say, one\nmight wonder why Wittgenstein does not treat the peculiar locution\n\u201ca in the relation R to b\u201d as a\ndefinite description \u2014 say, \u201cthe complex consisting of\na and b, combined so that aRb\u201d? This\ndescription could then be eliminated by applying the\nTractatus\u2019s own variant upon the theory of\ndescriptions: \n\nThe F is G \u2194 \u2203x(Fx\n& Gx) & ~\u2203x,y(Fx\n& Fy)\n\n(cf. 5.5321)\n\n\nHere the distinctness of the variables (the fact that they are\ndistinct) replaces the sign for distinctness \u201c\u2260\u201d (cf.\n5.53).\n\nSince Wittgenstein did not adopt this expedient, it seems likely that\nhe would have regarded the predicate \u201cx is a complex\nconsisting of a and b, combined so that\naRb\u201d as meaningless in virtue of \u2014 among other\nthings \u2014 its containing ineliminable occurrences of the\npseudo-concepts \u201ccomplex,\u201d \u201ccombination,\u201d and\n\u201cconstitution.\u201d Only the first of these notions figures on\nhis list of pseudo-concepts in the Tractatus (4.1272), but\nthere is no indication that that list is supposed to be exhaustive.\n\n\nThere is a further respect in which Wittgenstein\u2019s analytical\nproposals differ from Russell\u2019s. Russell\u2019s second\ndefinition \u2014 our [2] \u2014 has the effect of shifting the\nburden of indicating ontological commitment from the word\n\u2018exists\u2019 to the existential quantifier. In\nWittgenstein\u2019s definition, by contrast, no single item of\nvocabulary takes over the role of indicating ontological commitment.\nInstead, that commitment is indicated only after the final\napplication of the definition, by the meaningfulness of the names in\nthe fully analysed proposition \u2014 or, more precisely, by the fact\nthat certain symbols are names (cf. 5.535). The somewhat paradoxical\nconsequence is that one can assert a statement of the form\n\u201c[aRb] exists\u201d without thereby manifesting any\nontological commitment to the complex [aRb] (cf.\nEPB, 121). What this shows is that the two theories relieve\nthe assertor of ontological commitments of quite different kinds. In\nRussell\u2019s case, the analysis \u2014 our [2] \u2014 removes a\ncommitment to an apparent propositional constituent \u2014 a\n\u201cdenoting concept\u201d\n [5]\n \u2014expressed by the phrase \u2018the F,\u2019 but it\ndoes not remove the commitment to the F itself. For\nWittgenstein, by contrast, the analysis shows that the assertor never\nwas ontologically committed to the complex [aRb] by an\nutterance of \u201c[aRb] exists.\u201d \n\nRussell\u2019s conception of analysis at the time of the theory of\ndescriptions \u2014 c.a. 1905 \u2014 is relatively clear: Analysis\ninvolves pairing up one sentence with another that expresses the very\nsame Russellian proposition but which does so more perspicuously. The\nanalysans counts as more perspicuous than the analysandum because the\nformer is free of some of the latter\u2019s merely apparent\nontological commitments. By the time of Principia\nMathematica, however, this relatively transparent conception of\nanalysis is no longer available. Having purged his ontology of\npropositions in 1910, Russell can no longer appeal to the idea that\nanalysans and analysandum express one and the same proposition. He now\nadopts \u201cthe multiple relation theory of judgment,\u201d\naccording to which the judgment (say) that Othello loves Desdemona,\ninstead of being, as Russell had formerly supposed, a dyadic relation\nbetween the judging mind and the proposition Othello loves\nDesdemona, is now a non-dyadic, or, in Russell\u2019s\nterminology, \u201cmultiple,\u201d relation whose relata are the\njudging mind and those items that were formerly regarded as\nconstituents of the proposition Othello loves Desdemona\n(Russell 1910 [1994, 155]). After 1910 Russell can say that a speaker who\nsincerely assertively uttered the analysans (in a given context) would\nbe guaranteed to make the same judgment as one who sincerely\nassertively uttered the analysandum (in the same context), but he can\nno longer explain this accomplishment by saying that the two sentences\nexpress the same proposition. \n\nA further departure from the earlier, relatively transparent\nconception of analysis is occasioned by Russell\u2019s resolution of\nthe set-theoretic version of his paradox. In this resolution one gives\nan analysis of a sentence whose utterance could not be taken to\nexpress any judgment. One argues that the sentence\n\u201c{x: \u03c6x} \u03b5 {x:\n\u03c6x}\u201d is nonsense because the contextual definitions\nproviding for the elimination of class terms yield for this case a\nsentence that is itself nonsense by the lights of the theory of types\n(PM, 76). It\u2019s (apparent) negation is, accordingly,\nalso nonsense. In Principia, then, there is no very clear\nmodel of what is preserved in analysis. The best we can say is that\nRussell\u2019s contextual definitions have the feature that a\n(sincere, assertive) utterance of the analysans is guaranteed to\nexpress the same judgment as the analysandum, if the latter\nexpresses a judgment at all. \n\nSome of the unclarity in the conception of analysis introduced by\nRussell\u2019s rejection of propositions is inherited by\nWittgenstein, who similarly rejects any ontology of shadowy entities\nexpressed by sentences. In the Tractatus a\n\u201cproposition\u201d (Satz) is a \u201cpropositional\nsign in its projective relation to the world\u201d (3.12). This makes\nit seem as though any difference between propositional signs ought to\nsuffice for a difference between propositions, in which case analysans\nand analysandum could at best be distinct propositions with the same\ntruth conditions. \n\nEnough has now been said to make possible a consideration of\nWittgenstein\u2019s reasons for describing the position I have been\ncalling \u201clinguistic atomism\u201d as \u201cobvious.\u201d\nSince the model for Tractarian analysis is the replacement of apparent\nnames with (apparently) co-referring \u201cterms for\ncomplexes,\u201d together with eliminative paraphrase of the latter,\nit follows trivially that the endpoint of analysis, if there is one,\nwill contain neither \u201cterms for complexes\u201d nor expressions\nthat can be replaced by terms for complexes. \n\nWittgenstein, moreover, thinks it obvious that in the case of every\nproposition this process of analysis does terminate. The\nreason he supposes analysis cannot go on forever is that he conceives\nan unanalyzed proposition as deriving its sense from its\nanalysis. As Tractatus 3.261 puts it: \u201cEvery defined\nsign signifies via those signs by which it is defined\u201d (Cf.\nNB, 46; PT 3.20102). It follows that no proposition\ncan have an infinite analysis, on pain of never acquiring a sense. So\nthe process of analysis must terminate, and when it does so the\nproduct will be propositions devoid of incomplete symbols. \n\nThat much, at least, is plausibly obvious, but unfortunately\nit does not follow that the final analysis of language will be wholly\ndevoid of complex symbols. The trouble is that for all we have said so\nfar, a fully analysed proposition might yet contain one or more\ncomplex symbols that have meaning in their own right.\nClearly, Wittgenstein must have been assuming that all genuine\nreferring expressions must be semantically simple: they must lack\nanything like a Fregean sense. But why should that be so? The seeds of\none answer are contained in Tractatus 3.3, the proposition in\nwhich Wittgenstein enunciates his own version of Frege\u2019s context\nprinciple: \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the context\nof a proposition has a name meaning\u201d (3.3). Wittgenstein\u2019s\njuxtaposition of these two claims suggests that the context principle\nis supposed to be his ground for rejecting senses for sub-sentential\nexpressions. But just how it could provide such a ground is far from\nclear. Another, more concrete, possibility is that Wittgenstein simply\naccepted the arguments Russell had given in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\nfor rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions. \n",
