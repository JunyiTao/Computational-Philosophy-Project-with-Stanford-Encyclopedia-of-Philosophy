    "main_text": "An Anti-Meinongian First-Order View\n3. An Anti-Meinongian First-Order View\n\nThe previous two sections discussed views that deny that existence is\na property of individuals and views that deny that existence is a\nuniversal property. This section considers views according to which\nexistence is a universal property of individuals, in the hope of\nreaping the benefits of both the earlier views. It then explores the\ninteraction between quantifiers, tense operators, modal operators, and\na universal, first-order existence predicate in an attempt to expose\nsome difficulties such a view faces.\n\nFor both the Meinongian and the proponent of the proposal under\nconsideration, proper names are directly referential and simple\nsentences in which they occur express singular propositions. However,\nunlike the Meinongian, a proponent of the view to be developed in this\nsection insists that absolutely everything exists. In that case, a\nsentence like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist\u2019 either\nexpresses a fully articulate singular proposition and so is false, as\nin that case there is a referent of the subject-place singular term\nwhich exists, or does not express a truth evaluative proposition at\nall, as the singular term lacks a semantic content. In neither case is\nthe sentence true.  Avoiding that consequence was a primary motivation\nbehind all of the alternative accounts discussed in the previous two\nsections. The first challenge facing a proponent of such a view, then,\nis to explain how sentences like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not\nexist\u2019 are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without\nabandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and that all\nnames are devices of direct reference.\n\nOne important suggestion, adopted by Saul Kripke (1973 [2013]), Peter\nInwagen (1977, 1983, 2000, 2003), Nathan Salmon (1998), David Braun\n(1993, 2005), and Amie Thomasson (1999, 2003, 2009), among others, is\nthat seemingly empty names like \u2018Ronald McDonald\u2019 refer to\nexistent, albeit abstract, fictional characters. Fictional characters\nhave both being and existence. (For a powerful critique of this form\nof fictional realism, see Hofweber 2000.) As we don\u2019t run into\nthem on the street, see them on the bus, or feel them in our beds,\ngiven their lack of spatiotemporal location, it is plausible that what\na speaker means when she utters the sentence \u2018Ronald\nMcDonald does not exist\u2019 is not the false proposition that that\nsentence expresses but instead the true proposition that (the\nfictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a real person or is not\nconcrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the natural amendment,\n\u2018\u2018Ronald McDonald does not exist; he\u2019s a creation of\nadvertisement!\u2019\u2019 On this view, then, there are no\ngenuinely true singular negative existentials. All meaningful singular\nexistentials are true and their negations false. We mistakenly take\nsome singular negative existentials to be true because we conflate or\ndo not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete. The benefit\nof this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the sparse\nmetaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when we\nuse apparently true singular negative existentials.\n\nWe conclude this section by briefly discussing issues that arise with\nthe interaction between quantifiers, tense and modal operators, and a\nuniversal, first-order existence predicate, as this interaction is the\nsource of another important cost of the account of existence being\noutlined in this section. There are two sets of intuitions that seem\nto pull in opposite directions.  The first concerns the transience and\ncontingency of existence. Things seem to come in and go out of\nexistence through time. While Plato and Descartes used to exist, they\nno longer do; when Plato existed, Descartes did not yet exist; and\nright now the first child to be born in 2150 does not exist, but that\nindividual will. So, it seems, different things exist at different\ntimes. Likewise, of the things that in fact exist, it seems that some\nof them might not have existed at all and different\nthings\u2014things that in fact do not exist\u2014might have existed\ninstead or in addition. So, it seems, different things exist at\ndifferent worlds. These intuitions are quite robust. The second set of\nintuitions concern the ontological status of nonactual and nonpresent\nobjects. Many philosophers are drawn to the thesis of actualism: The\nthesis that absolutely everything is actual and how an object is\nsimpliciter is how it actually is, unactualized possibilities\nfor an object being in some sense hypothetical ways of being for that\nobject. While less popular, many philosophers accept the temporal\nanalog of actualism, the thesis of presentism, according to which\nabsolutely everything is present and how an object is\nsimpliciter is how it presently is, how an object was and\nwill be are in some sense hypothetical ways of being for that object.\nThese two sets of intuitions combined with the view of existence under\nconsideration in this section lead to difficulties.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the modal problem. There could have been an\nobject distinct from all actually existing objects. For example, I\ncould have had a brother and, given origin essentialism, if I had a\nbrother, he would have been distinct from every actually existing\nobjects, as no actually existing thing could have been my brother. Our\nintuitions concerning how things might have been lead us to accept\nthis claim as true. But, by the thesis of actualism, absolutely\neverything is actual and, by our view of existence, exists and so\nactually exists. So, it seems that actualism and our view of existence\nare incompatible with the intuitive possibility of there being an\nobject distinct from all existing objects and the intuition that I\nmight have had a brother.\n\nWe can regiment the contingency of existence intuition as followings,\nletting A be the actuality operator,\nwhere A\u03c6 is true with respect to a\nworld w under an interpretation I\njust in case \u03c6 is true with respect to the distinguished world of\nI: \n\u25ca\u2203x\u00acA\u2203y(y=x).\nCall this\nsentence Alien. The worry is that the truth of Alien carries\nontological commitment to merely possible individuals and so the\nfalsity of the thesis of actualism. One way to substantiate this worry\nis to invoke the Barcan Formula, or one of the mixing axioms proposed\nfor modal operators and quantifiers in Ruth Barcan Marcus\u2019s\ngroundbreaking work in quantified modal logic [Marcus 1946], according\nto which all instances of the sentence\n\u25ca\u2203x\u03c6(x)\n\u2192\u2203x\u25ca\u03c6(x) are logical true. (In the\nforegoing formulas, \u03c6(x) stands for any formula in which\nthe variable x may or may not be free.) We can then transpose\nthe modal and quantifier in Alien to derive\n\u2203x\u25ca\u00acA\u2203y(y=x).\nThe truth\nof this second sentence evidently requires that there is something\nthat is not actual, contrary to the dictates of actualism. The Barcan\nFormula, and in part for this very reason, is controversial and\nrejected by those that subscribe to a varying domains possible worlds\nsemantics for modal discourse. So this line of argument is not likely\nto convince everyone that our modal intuitions lead to problems. \n\nThe Barcan Formula is controversial. There is, however, a second line\nof argument that does not rest on the validity of the Barcan Formula,\nrelying instead on combining standard truth definitions for quantified\nand modal sentences in the most straightforward way. Alien is true\nunder an interpretation\nI just in case there is a world w\naccessible from the distinguished world of I with an\nobject in its domain that is not in the domain of the distinguished\nworld of I. This is because its truth requires that\n\u2203x\u00acA\u2203y(y=x)\nis true\nwith respect to w and so, it is tempting to conclude,\nthat there is a witness that satisfies the condition \u00acA\u2203y(y=x)\nat\nw. But that is the rub. If actualism is true, then\nthere is no such witness, even if there could have been. If we are\nrealistic about possible worlds semantics, the model theory for modal\ntalk itself does not contain primitive modality, instead containing\nworlds as points of evaluation and the notion of truth at a world, in\nwhich case \u2018there is\u2019 in the above truth recursion does\nnot occur inside the scope of a possibility operator. So, if Alien is\ntrue, there is some object o and accessible possible\nworld w such that o satisfies\n\u00acA\u2203y(y=x)\nat w, which seems to run contrary to the thesis of\nactualism, as that witness does not actually exist. (For further\ndiscussion of this problem and some of the solutions considered below,\nsee the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate.)\n\nOne solution is to abandon actualism and accept that there are merely\npossible objects. According to this possibilist position, merely\npossible objects are among the most unrestricted domain of\nquantification, being constituents of fundamental reality. While this\nposition deserves serious consideration, let us set it aside and\nexplore only actualist solutions. (The position is structurally\nsimilar to the Meinongian position, as the most inclusive domain of\nquantification, where there is in the most inclusive and unrestricted\nof senses, includes entities that do not actually exist, even if they\nexist simplicter.) A second solution rests on the Meinongian\ndistinction between being, in the sense of being a member of the most\ninclusive domain of quantification and discourse, and existing and the\nclaim that there are objects that do not exist. Armed with a\nMeinongian metaphysics, we can reject Alien as capturing the intuition\nthat existence is contingent, opting instead for the\nfollowing sentence as doing that, where E!x is the\nMeinongian logically primitive existence predicate:\n\u2203x(\u00acE!x \u2227 \u25caE!x).\nThe Meinongian can then deny Alien and appeal to the truth of this\nsentence to explain our intuitions concerning the contingency of\nexistence. Everything is actual, on this view, although some of those\nactual things do not exist but could have, even though they all have\nbeing and the domain of being is fixed across all possible\nworlds. This solution to our problems, however, is unavailable to a\nproponent of the view that existence is a universal property of\nindividuals.\n\nBernard Linsky and Edward Zalta [Linsky and Zalta 1994] present a\nnovel solution to this problem that promises to be consistent with the\ntenets of the view of existence under consideration in this section.\n(A similar account is defended by Timothy Williamson [Williamson 1998,\n1999a [2000], 1999b, 2000, 2002, 2013]. For a very interesting\ndiscussion of Williamson, see [Goodman 2016].) Consider the intuitive\npossibility that I have a brother. An entity that encodes the property\nof being my brother actually exists, but as a nonconcrete object. That\nobject is only contingently nonconcrete; it could have been concrete,\nand had it been concrete, it would have exemplified the property of\nbeing my brother (along with the other properties that it encodes and\nthe necessary consequences thereof). On this view, my possible brother\n(as well as any alleged merely possible object) actually exists, but\nas a nonconcrete individual that could have been concrete. The view is\nboth actualist, as absolutely everything is actual, and\nanti-Meinongian, as absolutely everything exists. Note, however, that\nAlien, the sentence two paragraphs above purported to capture our\nintuitions concerning the contingency of existence, is false on this\nview, as every individual is a necessary existent.  Instead, our\nintuition that what there is is contingent is to be explained in terms\nof the contingency of what is concrete and nonconcrete. So,\nwhere C!x is a logically primitive predicate of\nconcreteness, it is the truth of the following sentence, not Alien,\nthat explains those intuitions: \u2203x(\u00acC!x\n\u2227 \u25caC!x).  While the explanation of the\ncontingency of existence bears a structural similarity to the\nMeinongian explanation discussed in the previous paragraph, the\nmetaphysics is importantly different and so the two views should not\nbe collapsed. Linsky and Zalta describe a non-Meinongian, actualist\nview that treats existence as a universal property of individuals.\n\nLinsky and Zalta\u2019s view entails that concreteness is an\naccidental property, in the sense that the self-same individual that\nis in fact nonconcrete (my possible brother, for example) could have\nbeen concrete and the self-same individual that is in fact concrete\n(both you and me, for example) could have been nonconcrete. Many\nmetaphysicians will reject this on the grounds that concreteness is\ncategorical and an individual does not migrate through categorical\nproperties across modal space. But now consider the temporal analog of\nthe modal issues with existence and concreteness that we have been\nexploring: The problem of temporary existents. While one\u2019s\naccounts of the two problems do not need to swing together (Linsky and\nZalta, for example, do not offer the temporal analog of their account\nof contingent existents), as there are differences between alethic\nmodality and temporality, it is useful to consider them as a pair for\nour purposes.  Intuitively things come in and go out of existence;\nwhat exists at one time does not exist at another. The temporal analog\nof Linsky and Zalta\u2019s view of contingent existents entails that\neverything always exists. What there is and what exists at one time is\nthe same as what is and what exists at any other time; the domain of\nquantification is fixed across all times. What varies from time to\ntime is instead which of those individuals are concrete. Socrates\nstill exists now, although as a nonconcrete individual, who was\nconcrete in 450 BCE, and similarly for the first child to be born in\n2150. This view requires that a thing can survive the change from\nbeing nonconcrete to concrete, which is the explanation of what the\nancients would call generation, and the change from being concrete to\nnonconcrete, which is the explanation of what the ancients would call\ndestruction. On this view, then, seeming substantial changes are\nreally forms of qualitative change: A change in the quality of\nconcreteness. This runs contrary to the common conception that\nconcreteness is necessary and eternal to any object that instantiates\nit, the divide between concrete and nonconcrete individuals marking a\ndivide between categories of being. Many metaphysicians insist that,\njust as one and the same thing cannot go from being an individual to\nbeing a property, so too one and the same thing cannot go from being\nnonconcrete to being concrete.\n\nWhat are the prospects of a theory according to which existence is a\nuniversal, genuinely contingent and transient property of individuals?\nSuch a view requires that the domain of quantification varies from\nworld to world and time to time, as everything that is exists but\ndifferent individuals exist at different possible worlds and at\ndifferent times, in which case the domain of quantification varies\nfrom world to world and time to time. In that case, Alien from above\nis true. So fault must be found with the earlier argument that the\ntruth of Alien is inconsistent with the thesis of actualism. One\nresponse found in the literature rejects the last step, insisting that\nthere are general claims that could have been true, and so are true at\nsome accessible possible world, without there being specific instances\nof those claims that are true at those accessible worlds. In nonmodal\nenvironments, the quantified sentence \u2203x\u03c6(x)\nis true just in case there is some witness o that\nsatisfies the condition \u03c6(x). That condition fails,\nhowever, for quantified sentences true at a merely possible world. The\nmodel theory for a model language\u2014with its space of possible\nworlds and individuals populating the domains of possible\nworlds\u2014contains, like everything else if actualism is true, only\nactually existing entities. Still, sentences like Alien are true and\nso there are merely possible worlds at which\n\u2203x\u00acA\u2203y(y=x)\nis true.  There is no individual of which\n\u00acA\u2203y(y=x)\nis true in virtue of which the quantified sentence is true, although\nthere would have been had that merely possible world been actual. This\nis perhaps more clear when we turn from sentences being true with\nrespect to merely possible worlds to propositions being true at merely\npossible worlds. There is a world w at which the\nexistential proposition [there is something such that there is no\nactual thing identical to it] is true but there is no singular\nproposition [there is no actual thing identical to o]\ntrue at w as there is no such\nentity o. Had\nw been actual, however, then there would have been\nsuch an entity and it is this fact that grounds the truth of the\nexistential proposition at w. (The classic source for\nthis distinction is [Adams 1981]. See also [Fine 1985] and [Fitch\n1996].)  This suggestion, then, runs contrary to the standard\nsemantics for quantificational sentences, which reduces the truth or\nfalsity of existential and universal sentences to the truth or falsity\nof their instances, when extending that semantics to truth at a\nworld. The suggestion also requires a distinction between truth at a\nworld, in terms of which the model theory for modal operators is\ngiven, and truth in a world, which involves the notion of considering\nwhat would have been had a nonactual world been actual. (For more on\nthis distinction and the problem of the contingency of existence more\ngenerally, see the entry on the\non possibilism-actualism debate.)\n",
