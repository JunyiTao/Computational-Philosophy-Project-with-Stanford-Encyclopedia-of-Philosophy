    "main_text": "Ontology and Logic || Mally\u2019s Ontological and Logical Background\n2.1 Mally\u2019s Ontological and Logical Background\n\n\nMally was trained not only in philosophy but also in mathematics,\nand was influenced by Ernst Schr\u00f6der, and later, of course, by\nWhitehead and Russell. He therefore learned how to apply modern logical\nmethods to philosophical theories, and in particular to the theory of\nobjects (Gegenstandstheorie) developed by his teacher Alexius Meinong\nas well as to the theory of norms in his development of deontic logic.\nAmong the Austrian philosophers, Mally was one of the pioneers of\nformal methods in discussing philosophical problems. Note that Mally\u2019s\ndisciple Hans Mokre was the first to translate the introductory\nchapters to Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica into German,\nwith Mally\u2019s assistance (Russell/Whitehead 1932). Mally had originally\nplanned to translate the complete Principia himself.\n\n\nSince many of the problems giving rise to the theories of objects\nare covered elsewhere in this encyclopedia, we restrict ourselves to a\nvery short sketch of what led to Mally\u2019s contribution to that field.\nOne of the main impulses for the development of theories of objects\nwere the problems that arose in connection with\n intentionality.\nMally\u2019s teacher Meinong followed Brentano in concluding that the\ndistinctive and defining feature of intentional mental acts is that\nthey are always directed towards something. That is, thinking,\nbelieving, intending, etc., all involve thinking, believing, or\nintending something. Meinong took this a step further by believing that\nwe have to be ontologically generous when analyzing intentional mental\nacts: every such act is directed towards an object, even if sometimes\nthat object does not or cannot exist. So, when we search for the\nfountain of youth or think about the round square (and conclude that\nthe latter is impossible), Meinong required that there be such objects\nlike the fountain of youth and the round square. According to Meinong,\nthe former is an object (the waters of which confer everlasting life\nbut) which doesn\u2019t exist, while the latter is an object which is round,\nsquare, and which couldn\u2019t exist. (For a more complete discussion of\nMeinong\u2019s theory of nonexistent objects, see the entry on\n nonexistent objects.)\n\n\nThis ontologically generous attitude commits us to the acceptance of\ncontradictory and incomplete objects: if we accept contradictory\nobjects then we are at least dangerously close to tolerating\ncontradictions (unless we take appropriate precautions), and if we\naccept incomplete objects, we deny the intuitively plausible Law of\nExcluded Middle, namely, that for any property P, an object either has\nP or fails to have P (tertium non\ndatur). Meinong adopted one of Mally\u2019s distinctions for solving\nthe first of these problems, namely, the distinction between nuclear\n(formal/konstitutorisch) and extra-nuclear\n(au\u00dferformal/au\u00dferkonstitutorisch)\nproperties (see Meinong 1915: 176; Findlay 1963: 176; as well as\nsection 4.4.3 of the entry on Alexius Meinong). But later, Mally\ndeveloped an even more profound distinction with which he was able to\ncope with the incompleteness problem as well.\n\n\nMally\u2019s first work on Meinong\u2019s theory of objects is the published\nversion of his dissertation (Mally 1904). His own, mature theory of\nobjects can be found in the published version of his Habilitation\nthesis (Mally 1912). (For a detailed comparison of the two theories,\nsee Poli 1998.) Mally addressed the topic also in his later works,\ntaking a critical point of view with respect to Meinong\u2019s as well as\nhis own theory (Mally 1935, 1938b, 1971). Since Mally\u2019s\ntheory of objects is one of his most interesting and most influential\ncontributions to philosophy, we want to provide a more detailed account\nof the theory itself as well as of the problems it seems to be able to\nsolve, in the following section.\n",
