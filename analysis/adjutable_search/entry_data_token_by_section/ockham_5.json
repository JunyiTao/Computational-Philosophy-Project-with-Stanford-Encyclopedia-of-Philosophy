    "main_text": "Logic and Semantics\n3. Logic and Semantics\n\nOckham is rightly regarded as one of the most significant logicians of\nthe Middle Ages. Nevertheless, his originality and influence should\nnot be exaggerated. For all his deserved reputation, his logical views\nare sometimes\n derivative[11]\n and occasionally very\n idiosyncratic.[12]\n\nLogic, for Ockham, is crucial to the advancement of knowledge. In the\n\u201cPrefatory Letter\u201d to his Summa of Logic, for\nexample, he praises it in striking language:\n\nFor logic is the most useful tool of all the arts. Without it no\nscience can be fully known. It is not worn out by repeated use, after\nthe manner of material tools, but rather admits of continual growth\nthrough the diligent exercise of any other science. For just as a\nmechanic who lacks a complete knowledge of his tool gains a fuller\n[knowledge] by using it, so one who is educated in the firm principles\nof logic, while he painstakingly devotes his labor to the other\nsciences, acquires at the same time a greater skill at this art.\n\n\nOckham\u2019s main logical writings consist of a series of\ncommentaries (or \u201cexpositions\u201d) on Aristotle\u2019s and\nPorphyry\u2019s logical works, plus his own Summa of Logic,\nhis major work in the field. His Treatise on Predestination\ncontains an influential theory on the logic of future contingent\npropositions, and other works as well include occasional discussions\nof logical topics, notably his Quodlibets.\n",
