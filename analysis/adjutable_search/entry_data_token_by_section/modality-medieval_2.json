Modalities in Thirteenth-Century Logical Treatises\n\nModifying Boethius\u2019s systematization of Aristotle\u2019s\nremarks in De interpretatione 12 and 13, twelfth- and\nthirteenth-century logicians often presented the equipollences between\nmodal terms and opposed relations between modal propositions with the\nhelp of the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe square could be taken to refer to modals de dicto or\nsingular modals de re (see below.) Abelard tried to define\nthe opposed relations between quantified de re modals as\nwell, mistakenly thinking that these were the same as those between\nsingular modal propositions (Glossae super Perihermeneias\nXII, 468\u2013471, 530\u2013544). This question was not much\ndiscussed before its satisfactory solution in fourteenth-century modal\nsemantics. (See Hughes 1989 and his description of Buridan\u2019s\noctagon of modal opposites and equipollences.) While\npossibile and contingens are treated as synonyms in\nthe figure, it became more usual to associate the former with\none-sided possibility (not impossible) and the latter with two-sided\npossibility (neither necessary nor impossible).  \n\nThe anonymous Dialectica Monacensis (ca. 1200) is one of the\nnumerous works representing the new terminist approach to logic and\ncan be used as an example of how modalities were treated in it. (A\ncollection of late twelfth- and early thirteenth-century logical texts\nis edited in de Rijk 1962\u201367.) In discussing the quantity\n(universal, particular, singular) and quality (affirmative, negative)\nof the modals, the author states that modal terms may be adverbial or\nnominal. The modal adverb qualifies the copula, and the structure of\nthe sentence can be described as follows:\n\n(4)\nquantity/subject/modalized copula/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are necessarily B)\n\n\nIn this form, the negation can be located in different places,\neither\n\n(5)\nquantity/subject/copula modalized by a negated mode/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are-not-necessarily B)\n\n\nor\n\n(6)\nquantity/subject/modalized negative copula/predicate (for example: Some A\u2019s are-necessarily-not B)\n\n\nThe modal sentences with nominal modes can be read in two ways. One\ncan apply an adverbial type of reading to them, which is said to be\nhow Aristotle treats modal sentences in the Prior Analytics.\nThe quality and quantity of such a de re modal sentence is\ndetermined by the corresponding non-modal sentence. In a de\ndicto modal sentence that which is asserted in a non-modal\nsentence is considered as the subject about which the mode is\npredicated. When modal sentences are understood in this way, they are\nalways singular, their form being:\n\n(7)\nsubject/copula/mode (for example: That some A\u2019s are B is necessary.)\n\n\nThis reading is said to be the one which Aristotle presented in De\ninterpretatione (De Rijk 1967, II-2, 479.35\u2013480.26). The\nidea of the systematic distinction between the readings de\ndicto (in sensu composito) and de re (in\nsensu diviso) of modally qualified statements was employed in\nAbelard\u2019s investigations of modal statements (Glossae super\nPerihermeneias XII, 3\u2013106; Dialectica\n191.1\u2013210.19). Independently of Abelard, the distinction was\noften used, as in the Dialectica Monacensis, in discussions\nof the composition-division ambiguity of sentences. (See also\nMaier\u00f9 1972, ch. 5; Jacobi 1980, ch. 4.)\n\nFollowing Boethius, many authors referred to a modal distinction based\non a triple matter of assertoric sentences, namely natural,\ncontingent, or remote. In a sentence of natural matter, the predicate\nbelongs essentially to the subject or is its proprium, in contingent\nmatter, the predicate may belong or not belong to the subject, and in\nremote matter, the predicate cannot belong to the subject. See, for\nexample, Peter of Spain, Tractatus, p. 7; Dialectica\nMonacensis 472.9\u2013473.22. According to Garland the Computist (11th\ncentury), the opposite universal sentences of contingent matter are\nboth false and the opposite particular sentences are both true\n(Dialectica, 54.21\u201330; 82.25\u201330). The same division of the\nsentences of contingent matter based on the frequency interpretation\nof contingency is found in Aquinas (In Periherm. I.13, 168).\nSee also Boethius, In Periherm. II, 177.18\u2013178.8;\n303.15\u2013306.13; 325.8\u201315. Another often discussed theme was the\ndistinction between modalities per se and per\naccidens, which was based on the idea that the modal status of a\ntemporally indefinite sentence may be changeable or not; for example,\n\u2018You have not been in Paris\u2019 may begin to be impossible,\nwhereas \u2018You either have or have not been in Paris\u2019 may\nnot. (See, for example, William of Sherwood, Introduction to\nLogic, 41). Another distinction between sentences necessary\nper se and per accidens was based on\nAristotle\u2019s theory of per se predication in\nPosterior Analytics I.4. A sentence was said to be\naccidentally necessary when it was unchangeably true but, as distinct\nfrom per se predications, there was no necessary conceptual\nconnection between subject and predicate. This became an important\npart of thirteenth-century interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistics. (See, for example, Robert Kilwardby\u2019s Notule\nlibri Priorum 8.133\u2013142; 40.162\u2013174.)\n\nOne example of the prevalence of the traditional use of modal notions\ncan be found in the early medieval de dicto/de re analysis of\nexamples such as \u2018A standing man can sit\u2019. It was commonly\nstated that the composite (de dicto) sense is \u2018It is\npossible that a man sits and stands at the same time\u2019 and that\non this reading the sentence is false. The divided (de re)\nsense is \u2018A man who is now standing can sit\u2019 and on this\nreading the sentence is true. Many authors formulated the divided\npossibility as follows: \u2018A standing man can sit at another\ntime\u2019. It was assumed that a possibility refers to an\nactualization in the one and only world history and that it cannot\nrefer to the present moment because of the necessity of the present\nunderstood in the Aristotelian sense formulated in (2) and (3) above.\nWhen authors referred to another time, they thought that the\npossibility will be realized at that time or that the divided\npossibility refers to the future even though it may remain unrealized.\nThose who made use of the (at that time modern) idea of simultaneous\nalternatives took the composite reading to refer to one and the same\nstate of affairs and the divided reading to simultaneous alternative\nstates of affairs. This analysis was also applied to the question of\nwhether God\u2019s knowledge of things makes them necessary\n(Knuuttila 1993, 118\u2013121).\n\nA great deal of Abelard\u2019s logical works consisted of discussions\nof topics, consequences and conditionals. Like Boethius, Abelard\nthought that true conditionals express necessary connections between\nthe antecedents and the consequents. He argued that inseparability and\nentailment between the truth of the antecendent and consequent are\nrequired for the truth of a conditional. Some twelfth-century masters\nregarded the principle that the antecedent is not true without the\nconsequent as a sufficient condition for the truth of a conditional\nand accepted the so-called paradoxes of implication. The question of\nthe nature of conditionals and consequences remained a popular theme\nin medieval logic (Martin 1987, 2012).\n\nThe principles of propositional modal logic, found in Prior\nAnalytics I.15, were generally expressed as follows: if the\nantecedent of a valid consequence is possible/necessary, the\nconsequent is possible/necessary (Abelard, Dialectica\n202.6\u20138). However, the main interest was in modal syllogistic\nand modal predicate logic. Avicenna (d. 1037) wrote a brief Arabic\nsummary of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic, but his own theory was\ndifferent, being based on the assumptions that the subject terms and\nthe predicate terms of assertoric and modal propositions stand for all\npossible applications and the truth-conditions of assertoric\npropositions and corresponding possibility propositions are the same.\nIt follows, for example, that syllogisms with assertoric premises\ncoincide with uniform possibility syllogisms (Street 2002, 2005;\nLagerlund 2009). Avicenna was particularly interested in relative\nnecessities and distinguished between various types of conditional\nnecessities in terms of temporal determinations. Later Arabic works on\nmodal theories were much influenced by Avicenna. (See Strobino and\nThom 2016.) While Averroes\u2019s commentaries on the Prior\nAnalytics followed the main lines of Aristotle\u2019s text, his\nseparate treatise on modality involved new systematic ideas, mainly\nthe theory of accidental and per se necessary terms and the\ninterpretation of syllogistic necessity premises as per se\nnecessary predications with per se necessary terms. Both\nideas were inspired by Aristotle\u2019s remarks in the Posterior\nAnalytics I.4. Since Averroes took modal premises to be of the\ndivided type, assertoric premises in Aristotelian mixed\nnecessity-assertoric syllogisms must have a predicate term which is\nnecessary. The same applies to the subject term of the first premise\nin mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms (Quaesita octo in librum\nPriorum Analyticorum, IV.3, 84, in Aristotelis Opera cum\nAverrois Commentariis I.2b; see also Thom 2003, 81\u201385).\nThis is a speculative explanation of Aristotle\u2019s asymmetric\ntreatment of mixed necessity-assertoric syllogisms and mixed\nassertoric-necessity syllogisms. Gersonides later tried to develop\nfurther Averroes\u2019s remarks; see Manekin 1992. Analogous\nessentialist ideas were developed in thirteenth-century Latin\ndiscussions. \n\nThe first Latin commentary on the Prior Analytics is an\nanonymous late twelfth-century treatise (\u2018Anonymus Aurelianensis\nIII\u2019) which involves detailed discussions of modal conversion\nand modal syllogisms as well as many problems dealt with in ancient\ncommentaries. (See Ebbesen 2008; an edition by Thomsen Th\u00f6rnqvist\nin 2015.). Dialectica Monacensis\ninvolves a brief summary of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic the\nelements of which were discussed in logic courses in Paris in the\nfirst part of the thirteenth century. Robert Kilwardby\u2019s\ncommentary Notule libri Priorum (c. 1240) became an\nauthoritative work from which the discussions of modal syllogisms in\nthe commentaries of Albert the Great (ca. 1250) and many others were\nlargely derived. Abelard, who did not\ndeal with Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic, said that the modals in\nmixed syllogisms with both modal and assertoric premises should be\nunderstood in a way which he elsewhere characterizes as de re\ninterpretation (Glossae super Perihermeneias XII,\n189\u2013203). This reading of modal premises was often assumed,\nalthough it was seldom discussed as such. A central problem of\nAristotle\u2019s theory is that the structure of the premises is not\nanalyzed. Even if it is natural to think that the presupposition of\nthe mixed moods is a de re reading of modally qualified\npremises, this creates difficulties when applied to the conversion\nrules, most of which are unproblematic only if understood as rules for\nmodals de dicto. (According to Aristotle, necessity premises\nare converted in the same way as assertoric premises:\n\u2018Every/some A is B\u2019 implies \u2018Some B is A\u2019 and\n\u2018No A is B\u2019 implies \u2018No B is A\u2019. Affirmative\ncontingency premises are converted to corresponding negative\ncontingency premises and both these by the conversion of terms to\nparticular contingency propositions; Prior Analytics I.3,\n13.)\n\nWhile many historians think that Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic\nincluded incompatible elements, this was not the view of\nmid-thirteenth century logicians. Many of them discussed the same\nalleged counter-examples to the universal convertibility of necessary\npropositions, such as\n\n(8)\nEverything healthy (or awake) is necessarily an animal.\n\n\nRobert Kilwardby\u2019s explanation is based on the view that\nconvertible necessity premises are necessity propositions per\nse and not per accidens, like (8), which are not\nconvertible. (See Notule libri Priorum 8.133\u2013146.) In\naffirmative necessity propositions per se, the subject is\nper se connected to the predicate. In negative necessity\npropositions per se, the subject is per se\nincompatible with the predicate. The terms in per se\ninherences or incompatibilities are essential and necessarily stand\nfor the things they signify. The historical background of\nKilwardby\u2019s interpretation is not clear; it does show\nsimilarities to Averroes\u2019s discussion mentioned above, but there\nwas no historical link. (See Lagerlund 2000, 25\u201342; Thom 2007,\n19\u201328.)\n\nAs for the conversion of contingency propositions (neither necessary\nnor impossible), Kilwardby notes that while the converted propositions\nof indefinite (utrumlibet) contingency are of the same type\nof contingency, the conversion of natural contingency propositions\n(true about most cases) results in contingency propositions when\ncontingency means possibility proper (not impossible). There were\nextensive discussions of the kinds of contingency based on various\nphilosophical ideas in Kilwardby, Albert the Great and their\ncontemporaries (Knuuttila 2008, 540\u2013541).\n\nKilwardby follows Aristotle\u2019s remark that \u2018A contingently\nbelongs to B\u2019 may mean either \u2018A contingently belongs to\nthat to which B belongs\u2019 or \u2018A contingently belongs to\nthat to which B contingently belongs\u2019, Notule libri\nPriorum 18.682\u2013697. Kilwardby argues that the subject terms\nin contingency syllogisms are read in the second way and ampliated, if\nsyllogistic relations do not demand restrictions. In explaining the\ndifference in this respect between necessity propositions and\ncontingency propositions, he states that since the terms in per\nse necessity propositions are essential, \u2018Every A is\nnecessarily B\u2019 and \u2018Whatever is necessarily A is\nnecessarily B\u2019 behave in the same way in logic. Contingency\npropositions which are ampliated do not mean the same as those which\nare not ampliated (Notule libri Priorum 18.187\u2013207;\n18.653\u2013672). For the conversion of both types of contingency\npropositions and the role of the distinction between essential and\naccidental terms in defining the truth conditions of contingency\npropositions, see Thom 2019, 139\u2013149. In the conversion of \nde re readings of unampliated contingency propositions, the\npossibility changes into actuality, which is in agreement with the\nfrequency interpretation of modality.\n\nAccording to Kilwardby, the modal character of the predication in the\nconclusion of the perfect first figure syllogism follows from the\nfirst premise, which involves the whole syllogism in accordance with\nthe dici de omni et nullo (Lagerlund 2000, 41\u201342). The\npremises and the conclusion in uniform necessity syllogisms are\nnecessary per se. In mixed first-figure syllogisms with a\nmajor necessity premise and a minor asertoric premise, the\nnon-modalized premise should be simpliciter assertoric, i.e.,\na necessarily true per se predication. Similarly, in mixed\nfirst-figure syllogisms with contingent major and assertoric minor\npremises, the assertoric premise must be simpliciter\nassertoric, but this time the criteria are that the predicate belongs\nto the subject per se, invariably or by natural contingency\n(Notule libri Priorum 15.255\u2013301;\n20.706\u2013736).\n\nKilwardby explains that in first-figure mixed necessity-assertoric\nsyllogisms the necessity premise appropriates to itself a minor which\nis necessary per se; no such appropriation occurs in\nfirst-figure mixed assertoric-necessity syllogisms. There are similar\nappropriation rules for some mixed second-figure and third-figure\nmoods with assertoric and necessity premises and for various mixed\ncontingency moods pertaining to the kind of appropriated contingency\npremises or assertoric premises (Thom 2007, chs. 5\u20136).\n\nKilwardby and his followers regarded Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistic as the correct theory of modalities, the explication of\nwhich demanded various metaphysical considerations. As exemplified by\nthe appropriation rules, they assumed that propositions of the same\nform had different interpretations, depending on how they were related\nto other propositions in a syllogism. From the logical point of view,\nthese rules have an ad hoc character. (For some comparisons\nbetween contemporary philosophical modal logic and thirteenth-century\nviews, see also Uckelman 2009.) Thirteenth-century Aristotelian\nauthors generally assumed that modalities had a metaphysical\nfoundation in the hierarchical order of the nature of things that\ndetermined their occurrences in the temporal order accountable by\nfrequential modalities. This was the background of the popular\nAverroist classification of necessary and contingent causes in natural\nphilosophy (Knuuttila 1993, 129\u2013137). Following a twelfth-century\ndistinction, theologians divided between God\u2019s absolute power\nlimited by contradiction and God\u2019s ordained power as the first\nprinciple of the existing order (Moonan 1994; Gelber 2004, 309\u2013349).\n\n\nAfter Kilwardby and Albert the Great, who retailed him, several\nthirteenth-century authors wrote treatises on the Prior\nAnalytics. Ebbesen (2010) lists seven literal and six question\ncommentaries from the 1270s through the 1290s. One of these has been\nrecently edited, namely the question commentary of Radulphus Brito\n(2017). On the basis of the lists of the contents of the question\ncommentaries included in Ebbesen 2010, one can characterize this as a\nKilwardbian tradition. While Richard Campsall\u2019s early\nfourteenth-century Questions on Aristotle\u2019s Prior\nAnalytics was influenced by this literature, it also involved\nsome new modal ideas. Campsall thinks that one should discuss de\ndicto and de re modalities separately. In considering\nthe syllogistic logic of de re possibility statements with\nterms standing for actual things, he says that an affirmative de\nre possibility statement as of now implies the corresponding\nassertoric statement (5.40) and a negative assertoric statement as of\nnow implies the corresponding de re necessity statement\n(5.50). It follows that what is possible now is actualized and things\ncannot be otherwise because all true present tense negative statements\nare necessarily true. This is Campsall\u2019s version of the\ntraditional doctrine of the necessity of the present. But if the\ndenial of a present affirmative statement is necessary, how can the\nstatement itself be non-necessary? Campsall defines a de re\ncontingency statement as a conjunction of an affirmative and\ncorresponding negative possibility proper statement (7.34\u201336).\nPerhaps he thought that this is applicable to present tense statements\nwith actual terms and imply the idea of simultaneous alternatives, as\nsuggested by Lagerlund 2000, 87\u201390. But Campsall also equates\nde re necessity with respect to actual things to unchanging\npredication and contingency to changing predication. Actual things may\nbe contingent in the sense that they will be changed in the future\n(12.31). For Campshall\u2019s confusing formulations, see also\nKnuuttila 2018.\n",
