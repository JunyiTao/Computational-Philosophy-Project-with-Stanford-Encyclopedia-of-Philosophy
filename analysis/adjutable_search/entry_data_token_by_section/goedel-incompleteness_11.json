    "main_text": "The Second Incompleteness Theorem || Derivability Conditions\n3.2 Derivability Conditions\n\nThe proof of the second incompleteness theorem requires that the\nprovability predicate in \\(F\\) satisfies a number of conditions\nwhich are used in the details of the proof. There are several\ndifferent sets of conditions that will do.\n\nThe first detailed proof of the second incompleteness theorem appeared\nin (Hilbert & Bernays 1939) (mainly written by Bernays), though\nonly for one specific theory, PA. It uses a rather\nawkward set of conditions for the provability predicate. These were\nmore technical lemmas for the needs of a particular proof and not any\nsort of analysis of \u201cnatural\u201d provability predicates. A\nmuch more elegant, now standard list of \u201cderivability\nconditions\u201d was presented by L\u00f6b (1955)\u2014though their\nintended use was somewhat different (see below).\n\nL\u00f6b\u2019s Derivability Conditions\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{D1} F &\\vdash A \\Rightarrow F \\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner). \\\\\n\\tag{D2} F &\\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\rightarrow\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner)\\urcorner). \\\\\n\\tag{D3} F &\\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) \\wedge\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A \\rightarrow B\\urcorner) \\rightarrow\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner B\\urcorner).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(D1) is simply a restatement of the requirement from the proof of the\nfirst theorem that provability is weakly representable. Roughly put,\n(D2) requires that the whole demonstration of (D1), for the candidate\nprovability predicate \\(\\Prov_F\\), can itself be\nformalized inside \\(F\\). Finally, (D3) requires that the\nprovability predicate is closed under Modus Ponens.\n\nIf the arithmetized provability predicate indeed satisfies these\nconditions, the second theorem can be proved. Let\n\\(G_F\\) once again be the G\u00f6del sentence for\n\\(F\\) given by the first theorem. It is not too difficult to show,\nusing the derivability conditions, that:\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash G_F \\leftrightarrow \\Cons(F).\n\\]\n\n\nThis immediately yields the unprovability of \\(\\Cons(F)\\),\ngiven the first incompleteness theorem. \n\nFurthermore, Jeroslow (1973) demonstrated, with an ingenious trick,\nthat it is in fact possible to establish the second theorem without\n(D3). However, in some other cases (e.g., when proving\nL\u00f6b\u2019s theorem; see below), and in Provability Logic, all\nthree conditions are still needed.\n",
