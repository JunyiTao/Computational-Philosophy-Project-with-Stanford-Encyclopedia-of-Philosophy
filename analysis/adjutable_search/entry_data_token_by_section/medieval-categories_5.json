    "main_text": "Thirteenth Century || Albertus Magnus (b. 1200, d. 1280)\n4.2  Albertus Magnus (b. 1200, d. 1280)\n\n\nAlthough other commentaries on the categories were written shortly\nafter Kilwardby's Commentary (such as those written by Peter of Spain,\nRoger Bacon, Nicholas of Paris, and Johannes Pagus), the most\nimportant commentary was by Albertus Magnus. Albertus wrote\napproximately seventy works, not counting his sermons and letters. A\nlarge number of these were commentaries on the extant works of\nAristotle available to him at the time.  Nine of these works are\ndevoted to logic, and of these, six are commentaries on Aristotle's\nOrganon. However, within these commentaries, there is strong\ninclination towards a Neo\u2013Platonic ontology which he barely\nmanages to keep apart from logic.  \n\n\nAn important element in Albert's Commentary is his derivation of the\nten categories, which was further developed and defended by his most\nfamous disciple, Thomas Aquinas.  Albert takes the modi praedicandi as\nhis starting point in his division of the categories.  The main\ndivision is between per se predicaments and those not per se, i.e.,\nbetween substance and accidents. The accidents are in turn divided\ninto absolute accidents and those with some sort of relation to\nothers. Absolute accidents are in turn divided on the basis of matter\n(which gives rise to quantity) or form (which brings about\nquality). Those accidents that have a relation to another are either\ncaused by the substance or by something extrinsic to the substance. As\nto the accidents caused by the substance, they are either caused by\nthe form (which accounts for action), the matter (which accounts for\npassion), or the entire composite (which accounts for relation). When\nthe relation is based on the parts to the whole, one has position. As\nto the accidents caused by something extrinsic, if the cause is due to\nproximity, there results the category of place. If the cause is due to\nmotion, the category of time results. Finally, the category of habit\nresults if the cause produces some addition to the substance. (For\nmore on Albert's derivation of the categories and how it influenced\nAquinas, see Bos 1998). \n\n\nAlbert's Commentary is significant in that it is a close paraphrase of\nthe original Aristotelian text. (For its structure, see Ebbesen,\n1981). Although there is no translation of it into English, there is a\nnew critical edition of it. \n",
