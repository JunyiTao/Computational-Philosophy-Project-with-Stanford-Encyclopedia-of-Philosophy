    "main_text": "The set theory of the continuum || Descriptive Set Theory\n6.1 Descriptive Set Theory\n\nDescriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure of\ndefinable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable\nsubsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and other Polish spaces (i.e.,\ntopological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete\nmetric space), such as the Baire space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) of all\nfunctions \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\), the space of complex\nnumbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach spaces. The simplest sets\nof real numbers are the basic open sets (i.e., the open intervals with\nrational endpoints), and their complements. The sets that are obtained\nin a countable number of steps by starting from the basic open sets\nand applying the operations of taking the complement and forming a\ncountable union of previously obtained sets are the Borel\nsets. All Borel sets are regular, that is, they enjoy\nall the classical regularity properties. One example of a\nregularity property is the Lebesgue measurability: a set of\nreals is Lebesgue measurable if it differs from a Borel set by a null\nset, namely, a set that can be covered by sets of basic open intervals\nof arbitrarily-small total length. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is\nLebesgue measurable, but sets more complicated than the Borel ones may\nnot be. Other classical regularity properties are the Baire\nproperty (a set of reals has the Baire property if it differs\nfrom an open set by a meager set, namely, a set that is a countable\nunion of sets that are not dense in any interval), and the perfect\nset property (a set of reals has the perfect set property if it\nis either countable or contains a perfect set, namely, a nonempty\nclosed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one can prove that there\nexist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is necessary for this\n(Solovay 1970).\n\nThe analytic sets, also called \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_1\\), are\nthe continuous images of Borel sets. And the co-analytic, or\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_1\\), sets are the complements of analytic sets.\n\nStarting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying the\noperations of projection (from the product space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) and complementation, one obtains the\nprojective sets. The projective sets form a hierarchy of\nincreasing complexity. For example, if \\(A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) is co-analytic, then the projection \\(\\{ x\\in\n\\mathbb{R}: \\exists y\\in \\mathcal{N}((x,y)\\in A)\\}\\) is a projective\nset in the next level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those\nsets are called \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\), and their complements are\ncalled \\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_2\\).\n\nThe projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical practice,\nfor it turns out that a set \\(A\\) of reals is projective if and only\nif it is definable in the structure\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{R}=(\\mathbb{R}, +,\\cdot ,\\mathbb{Z}).\\]\n\n\nThat is, there is a first-order formula \\(\\varphi ( x, y_1,\\ldots,\ny_n)\\) in the language for the structure such that for some\n\\(r_1,\\ldots ,r_n\\in \\mathbb{R}\\),\n\n\n\\[A=\\{ x\\in \\mathbb{R}: \\mathcal{R}\\models \\varphi(x,r_1,\\ldots\n,r_n)\\}.\\]\n\n\nZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic\nset, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves\nthat every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect\nset property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable\ncardinal, \\(\\aleph_1\\), is a large cardinal in the constructible\nuniverse \\(L\\) (see\n Section 7),\n namely a so-called inaccessible cardinal (see\n Section 10),\n which implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every co-analytic set\nhas the perfect set property.\n\nThe theory of projective sets of complexity greater than co-analytic\nis completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in \\(L\\) there is a\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set that is not Lebesgue measurable and does\nnot have the Baire property, whereas if Martin\u2019s axiom holds\n(see\n Section 11),\n every such set has those regularity properties. There is, however, an\naxiom, called the axiom of Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is\nconsistent with ZFC, modulo the consistency of some large cardinals\n(in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and\nimplies that all projective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles\nessentially all questions about the projective sets. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for further details.\n",
