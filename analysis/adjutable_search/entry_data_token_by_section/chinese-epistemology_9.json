    "main_text": "Classical Approaches || Proto-analytic Approaches\n3.3 Proto-analytic Approaches\n\nThe next position which decisively influenced the further development\nof epistemological debates derived from certain analytical approaches\nbased either upon isomorphic assumptions, as advocated by the\nrepresentatives of the School of Names (Ming jia), especially by\nGongsun Long, or upon linguistic relativism. The latter was elaborated\nby the followers of the so-called Neo-Mohist school (Houqi Mo\njia \u5f8c\u671f\u58a8\u5bb6) through a purely formal\nanalytical method. However, the approach to the linguistic analysis of\nthe two most important representatives of the School of Names, i.e.,\nGongsun Long and Hui Shi (ca 370\u2013310 BC), sustained\nfundamentally divergent views regarding the relationship between names\nand actualities, with Gongsun Long arguing that the ideal construct of\nan accomplished language was still of crucial importance, and that\nlanguage and social reality were inseparably linked and semantically\noverlapping (Xiang 2000: 52). His arguments were founded upon the\nConfucian premise that the ideal application of language was based\nupon a complete mutual congruency of the name and the object to which\nit referred (Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: Bai ma lun, 4). Despite\nhis idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a consecrated\nstructure which embraced the essence of all existence, but that the\ncrucial function of language remained that of denominating actualities\n(Gongsun Longzi CTP 2014: Ming shi lun, 13). This is the\nhypothesis which underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled\nThe Dispute on Names and Actualities (Ming shi\nlun).\n\nHui Shi instead believed names (ming) provided a basis for\ncategorizing reality (Xiang 2000: 51), a position which placed him in\ndirect opposition to Mohist approaches. His \u201cconstant\u201d\nrelativism was also a response to Neo-Mohist realism, which was\nfounded upon formal distinctions as a necessary precondition for\ncomprehension. As his 11th paradox (see Zhuangzi CTP:\nTianxia, 7) indicates, the Neo-Mohist \u201cobsession\u201d with\ndefinitions of particular terms (or names) was likewise redundant.\n\nIn any case, this analytic epistemological current of the ancient\nChinese tradition, which was rediscovered only in the latter half of\nthe 20th century, helped dispel a number of prejudices\nconcerning the methodological uniformity of classical Chinese thought\n(Allison 1989: 8). Certain similar \u201crealist\u201d currents\nwithin ancient Chinese discourses formulated additional\nepistemological questions related to binary oppositions of identity\nand difference (tong/yi \u540c/\u7570), or the\nconsistency and quality (jian/bai \u5805/\u767d) of the\nobjects of comprehension.\n\nGongsun Long\u2019s arguments were founded upon Confucius\u2019\npremise that the ideal application of language was based on a complete\nmutual congruency of the name and the object to which it referred.\nDespite his idealistic stance, he believed language was not only a\nconsecrated structure which embraced the essence of all existence, but\nthat the crucial function of language remained that of denominating\nactualities (Gongsun Longzi CTP: Bai ma lun, 4). This is the\nhypothesis which underpins his main arguments on this topic, entitled\nThe Dispute on Names and Actualities (Ming shi lun).\nWith respect to the concrete situation to which language has been\napplied, each single thing could have only one single meaning. Of\ncourse, this projection is in contrast with the usual application of\nlanguage, for people tend to use different names for the same objects.\nIn everyday language, the meanings of words usually overlap. Gongsun\nLong attempted to eliminate this semantic overlapping, or at least to\nreduce it to a level on which language could still be overseen and\ncontrolled. The famous \u2018White horse not horse\u2019 debate was\nan attempt to deal with these concerns.\n\nFor the Neo-Mohist philosophers, however, the semantic overlapping of\ndifferent terms was a natural quality of human language and,\nconsequently, they saw no need to eliminate it. They were far more\ninterested in the question of language as a means for categorizing\nsociety.\n\nHowever, given that the variegated complexity of language could not be\nmolded into a reliable regulatory structure within the linguistic\nconventions (Mozi CTP: Jing xia, 140), they acknowledged the\nde facto unreliability of language, concluding that a\ngeneral, valid standardization of language was impossible. In their\nview, the formal indefinableness of language was, to a degree, a part\nof its intrinsic structure (Mozi CTP: Jing xia, 168).\n\nInstead of the endless search for definitions of the semantic\nextensions of terms, the Neo-Mohists preferred to deal with questions\nthat addressed causal connections. However, their approach to these\nquestions differed greatly from that of formal logic in many respects.\nThey were disinterested in the attempts to construct an ideal\nlanguage, as expressed in the discourses on names; instead, they\nfocused on linguistic analyses, which led them to conclusions that\nwere diametrically opposed to Gongsun Long\u2019s ideas and the early\nConfucian views on the relation between names and actualities.\n\nMore specifically, their analyses led them to conclude that the\nconnections between certain individual names (ming), which\nwere simply understood as arbitrary entities of language, were\nmulti-layered and incoherent. While some compound terms could embrace\nsemantic scopes that extended beyond all the partial meanings of the\nindividual mings (i.e., the linguistic entities of which they\nwere compounded), in other instances the exact opposite was true (Mozi\nCTP: Jing xia, 102).\n\nHowever, the fragments of their analyses which have survived do not\ncontain any substantial discovery that goes beyond the recognition or\nacknowledgment of the inconsistent nature of linguistic structures.\nThus, in contrast to Gongsun Long, their investigations were not aimed\nat establishing a universal linguistic system that could unify\ndivergent models of language application. A fundamental premise of\ntheir work was that the formal shapes of naming could not embrace the\ncomplex integrity of existence, as reflected in actualities. Language\ncould never attain, let alone go beyond actual existence;\nconsequently, the objective features of reality automatically\ndetermined and limited the structures of language, and thus our\napplication of linguistic constructs and expressions (Mozi CTP: Da\nqu, 25).\n\nHowever, this did not mean that language was exclusively a product of\narbitrary social conventions. Despite its fundamental importance, the\nonly Neo-Mohist attempt to establish a formal linguistic basis for\nthis notion can be found in their analysis of the classical\ndistinction between identity and difference (tong yi, Mozi\nCTP: Da qu, 22).\n\nThe issue here is the problem of the essential relativity of this\ndistinction with respect to various contexts, for the difference\nbetween the two antipodes is by no means more constant than, for\nexample, the difference between the notions of largeness and\nsmallness, or length and shortness. From a realistic viewpoint, this\ncan appear as paradoxical, and this paradox was formulated and\nanalyzed by Hui Shi, a Nominalist philosopher who was the closest to\nDaoist discourses. By means of his apparently paradoxical\nsuppositions, Hui Shi attempted to situate the problem of identity and\ndifference within the context of holistic relativity. Through his\nexposition of contradictions, by which he showed the limits of the\nsemantic extensions of certain attributes, he wished to demonstrate\nthe relativity of time and space as expressed in the names\n(ming) applied in different contexts.\n\nOne of his most significant contributions to the classical\nepistemology of linguistic analysis can be found in his comment on the\ngeneral problem of identity and difference which, as we have seen, the\nrepresentatives of the Neo-Mohist school were unable to develop to a\nconcise conclusion (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP: Tianxia, 7). He\nclaimed that any two things were always different in something, no\nmatter how equivalent they were in all other respects (otherwise they\ncould not represent two separate entities). Yet even two things that\nseemed to be completely different were likewise identical in at least\none quality, since they were both parts of a unified structure\n(otherwise, it would not be possible to express, or even think of them\nin the framework of language).\n\nHui Shi\u2019s \u201cconstant\u201d relativism was, of course, a\nresponse to the Neo-Mohist realism, which was founded upon formal\ndistinctions as a necessary precondition for comprehension. As his\n11th paradox indicates, the Neo-Mohist obsession with\ndefinitions was likewise redundant (Hui Shi in Zhuangzi CTP:\nTianxia, 7). His categorization of identity and difference,\nor of the radical relativity of objects, was thus based upon the\nimpossibility of conceptual definitions of reality, since every\nlinguistic comprehension was necessarily limited to a contextually\ndetermined meaning which was incapable of embracing all dimensions of\nthe object of comprehension.\n",
