    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Madmen and Martians\n4.3 Madmen and Martians\n\nPain is defined by its causal role. Central to that role is that we\nare averse to pain, and try to avoid it. But not all of us do. Some of\nus seek out pain. Call them madmen. A good theory of pain should\naccount for the possibility of madmen.\n\nThe simplest way to account for madmen would be to simply identify\npain with a neural state. So Lewis\u2019s identity theory is\nwell-placed to deal with them. But there is a complication. Not every\ncreature in the universe who is in pain has the same neural states as\nus. It is at least possible that there are creatures in which some\nsilicon state S plays the pain role. That is, the creatures are averse\nto S, they take S to be an indicator of bodily damage, and so on.\nThose creatures are in pain whenever they are in state S. Call any\nsuch creature a Martian. A simple identification of pain with neural\nstate N will stipulate that there couldn\u2019t be any Martians. That\nwould be a bad stipulation to make.\n\nThe possibility of madmen pushes us away from a simple functional\ndefinition of pain. Some creatures have pains that do not play the\npain role. The possibility of Martians pushes us away from a purely\nneural definition of pains. Some creatures have pains that are not\nlike our neural pain states. Indeed, some of them might have pains\nwithout having any neural states at all. Lewis\u2019s way of\nthreading this needle is to say that pains, like all mental states,\nare defined for kinds of creatures. Pains in humans are certain neural\nstates. They are the neural states that (typically, in humans) have\nthe functional role that we associate with pain. In other kinds of\ncreatures pains are other states that (typically, in those creatures)\nplay the pain role. The details of these views are worked out in\n\u201cMad Pain and Martian Pain\u201d (1980c).\n",
