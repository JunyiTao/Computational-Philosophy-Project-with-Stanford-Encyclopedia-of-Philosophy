The paradigm of this kind of cognition\nare mathematical and logical truths and fundamental moral intuitions,\nwhich we understand not because we believe a teacher or a book but\nbecause we see them for ourselves (De magistro 40, cf. De\nlibero arbitrio 2.34). The condition of possibility and the\ncriterion of truth of this intellectual insight is none other than God\n(a view attributed, with explicit approval, to the Platonists in\nDe civitate dei 8.7), who, in the manner of a Neoplatonic\nimmaterial principle, is both immanent and transcendent in relation to\nour soul. Augustine mostly explains this Platonizing theory of a\npriori knowledge by means of two striking images: the inner teacher\nand illumination. The former is introduced in the dialogue De\nmagistro (ca. 390) and remains frequent especially in the sermons\n(e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 3.13;\nFuhrer 2018b); according to it, Christ is present in our souls and by\n\u201cpresiding over\u201d them like a teacher guarantees the\ntruthfulness of our understanding (De magistro 38\u201339,\ncf. Ephesians 3:17 for the image and, for the idea that truth\n\u201clives in the inner man\u201d, De vera religione 72).\nThe latter appears first in the Soliloquia (1.12\u201315)\nand is ubiquitous in Augustine\u2019s writings (cf. esp. De\ntrinitate 12.24). It is ultimately derived from the Analogy of\nthe Sun in Plato\u2019s Republic (508a-509b; cf. Rist 1994:\n78\u201379). In the Soliloquia Augustine says, in a manner\nstrongly reminiscent of Plato, that just as the sun is both visible\nitself and illumines the objects of sight so as to enable the eye to\nsee them, God is intelligible himself and illumines the intelligible\nobjects (which are here identified with the objects of the liberal\ndisciplines and subordinated to God) so as to enable reason (the\n\u201ceye\u201d of the soul) to activate its capacity for\nintellection. The later version in De trinitate explicitly\npresents divine illumination as an alternative to Platonic\nrecollection and situates it in the framework of a theory of creation.\nHere Augustine says that the human mind has been created by God in\nsuch a way as to be \u201cconnected\u201d to intelligible reality\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (subiuncta) and with a capacity\n(capacitas) that enables it to \u201csee\u201d the\nintelligibles in the light of intelligible truth, just as the eye is\nby nature able to see colors in the light of the sun. Obviously,\n\u201ccapacity\u201d in this case does not mean pure potentiality\n(as in the tabula rasa theory endorsed by Augustine\u2019s\ninterlocutor Euodius in De quantitate animae 34) but\ncomprises at least implicit or latent knowledge of moral and\nepistemological standards. Both images, if properly read, should\npreclude the misunderstanding that Augustine\u2019s gnoseology makes\nhuman knowledge entirely dependent on divine agency, with the human\nbeing becoming merely a passive recipient of revelation (cf. Gilson\n1943: ch. 4 and Lagouan\u00e8re 2012: 158\u2013180 for the debates\nabout Augustinian illumination in medieval and modern philosophy).\nCognition does not simply result from the presence of Christ in our\nsoul but from our \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner teacher, i.e.,\nour testing propositions that claim to convey a truth about\nintelligible reality (or even a general truth about sensible objects,\ncf. Letter 13.3\u20134) against the inner standards we\npossess thanks to the presence of Christ (De magistro\n37\u201338; this way of \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner truth is\nrepeatedly dramatized in the Confessiones, e.g., 11.10;\n11.31; Cary 2008b: 100). And while every human being is\n\u201cillumined\u201d by the divine light at least from behind so as\nto be able to pass true judgments about right and wrong or good and\nevil, in order to develop these natural intuitions to full knowledge\nor wisdom and to be able actually to lead a virtuous life, we need to\nconvert to God, the \u201csource\u201d of the light (De\ntrinitate 14.21). Thus, while all human beings are by nature\ncapable of accessing intelligible truth, only those succeed in doing\nso who have a sufficiently good will (De magistro\n38)\u2014presumably those who endorse Christian religion and live\naccordingly. This strong voluntary element intimately connects\nAugustine\u2019s epistemology with his ethics and, ultimately, with\nhis doctrine of grace (on the parallel structure of cognition and grace in Augustine\nsee Lorenz 1964). Like all human agency, striving for wisdom takes place\nunder the conditions of a fallen world and meets the difficulties and\nhindrances humanity is subject to because of original sin.\n\nIn order to illustrate what he means by \u201cseeing things by\nourselves\u201d \u201cin the light of truth\u201d, Augustine often\ncites the example of the Socratic maieutic dialogue (De\nmagistro 40; cf. De immortalitate animae 6; De\ntrinitate 12.24), and in some passages of his early work he seems\nto subscribe to the Platonic doctrine of recollection (familiar to him\nfrom Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 1.57) in such a way as to\nimply the preexistence of the soul (Soliloquia 2.35,\nretracted in Retractationes 1.4.4; De immortalitate\nanimae 6; De quantitate animae 34, retracted in\nRetractationes 1.8.2). It is difficult to tell whether the\nearly Augustine literally believed in recollection and preexistence\n(Karf\u00edkov\u00e1 2017; O\u2019Daly 1987: 70\u201375;\n199\u2013207), not least because he was aware that some Neoplatonists\ninterpreted Platonic recollection as an actualization of our\never-present but latent knowledge of the intelligible rather than as a\nremembrance of our past acquaintance with it (Letter 7.2, cf.\nPlotinus, Enneads IV.3.25.31\u201333; O\u2019Daly 1976).\nIf, as in De immortalitate animae 6, recollection is taken to\nprove the immortality of the soul (as it did in the Phaedo),\nit is hard to see how preexistence should not be implied. In any\nevent, it is imprecise to say, as it is sometimes done, that Augustine\ngave up the theory of recollection because he realized that\npreexistence was at variance with Christian faith. In De civitate\ndei (12.14 etc.) Augustine emphatically rejects\nPlatonic-Pythagorean metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls as\nincompatible with eternal happiness and the economy of salvation, and\nin De trinitate (12.24) the Meno version of the\nrecollection theory, which implies transmigration, is rejected in\nfavor of illumination. Yet it is a fallacy to claim that recollection\nentails transmigration. The early Augustine may have believed in\npreexistence (perhaps simply as a corollary of the immortality of the\nsoul), but there is no evidence that he believed in the transmigration\nof souls; conversely, his rejection of transmigration did not prevent\neven the late Augustine from considering preexistence\u2014at least\ntheoretically\u2014an option for the origin of the soul\n(Letter 143.6 from 412; cf.\n 6.1 Soul as a Created Being).\n5.3 Faith and Reason\n\nWhereas modern discussion tends to regard faith and reason as\nalternative or even mutually exclusive ways to (religious) truth, in\nAugustine\u2019s epistemological and exegetical program the two are\ninseparable. He rejects the rationalism of the philosophers and,\nespecially, the Manicheans as an unwarranted over-confidence into the\nabilities of human reason resulting from sinful pride and as an\narrogant neglect of the revelation of Christ in Scripture (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.56; 60; Confessiones 3.10\u201312).\nAgainst the fideism he encountered in some Christian circles (cf.\nLetter 119 from Consentius to Augustine) he insisted that it\nwas good and natural to employ the rational capacity we have been\ncreated with to search for an understanding of the truths we accept\nfrom the authority of the biblical revelation, even though a true\nunderstanding of God will only be possible after this life when we see\nhim \u201cface to face\u201d (Letter 120.3\u20134). In\nthis epistemological and exegetical program, which since Anselm of\nCanterbury has aptly been labeled as \u201cfaith seeking\nunderstanding\u201d (cf. De trinitate 15.2: fides\nquaerit, intellectus invenit) or \u201cunderstanding of\nfaith\u201d (intellectus fidei), faith is prior to\nunderstanding in time but posterior to it in importance and value\n(De ordine 2.26; De vera religione 45;\nLetter 120.3; van Fleteren 2010). The first step toward\nperfection is to believe the words of Scripture; the second is to\nrealize that the words are outward signs of an internal and\nintelligible reality and that they admonish us to turn to and to\n\u201cconsult\u201d inner truth so as to reach true understanding\nand, accordingly, the good life (cf.\n 5.2 Illumination;\n 5.4 Language and Signs). \nPhilosophical argument may be of help in this process;\nyet as Augustine notes as early as in Contra Academicos\n(3.43), it needs to be tied to the authority of Scripture and the\nCreed to prevent the frailty of human reason from going astray (cf.\nConfessiones 7.13). The Augustine of the earliest dialogues\nseems to have entertained the elitist idea that those educated in the\nliberal arts and capable of the Neoplatonic intellectual ascent may\nactually outgrow authority and achieve a full understanding of the\ndivine already in this life (De ordine 2.26, but contrast ib.\n2.45 on Monnica). In his later work, he abandons this hope and\nemphasizes that during this life, inevitably characterized by sin and\nweakness, every human being remains in need of the guidance of the\nrevealed authority of Christ (Cary 2008b: 109\u2013120). Faith is\nthus not just an epistemological but also an ethical category; it is\nessential for the moral purification we need to undergo before we can\nhope for even a glimpse of true understanding (Soliloquia\n1.12; De diversis quaestionibus 48; De trinitate\n4.24; Rist 2001). To a great extent, Augustine\u2019s defense of\nfaith as a valid epistemic category rests on a rehabilitation of true\nbelief against the philosophical (Platonic and Hellenistic) tradition.\nAugustine neatly distinguishes \u201cbelief\u201d (fides,\nthe word he also uses for religious faith), which entails the\nbeliever\u2019s awareness that he does not know, from\n\u201copinion\u201d (opinio), defined by the philosophers\nas the illusion of knowing what one in fact does not know (De\nutilitate credendi 25; Letter 120.3). Without belief in\nthe former sense, we would have to admit that we are ignorant of our\nown lineage (Confessiones 6.7) and of the objects of the\nhistorical and empirical sciences, of which, as Augustine asserts in a\ncritique of Platonism, first-hand knowledge is rarely possible (De\ntrinitate 4.21). The belief that a person we have not seen was or\nis just may trigger our fraternal love for him (De trinitate\n8.7; Bouton-Touboulic 2012: 182\u2013187; conversely, Augustine asks\nthose who are united with him in fraternal love to believe what he\ntells them about his life, Confessiones 10.3). And obviously,\nthe crucial events of the history of salvation, Jesus\u2019 death on\nthe cross and his resurrection, cannot be known but only believed qua\nhistorical events, even though qua signs they may lead to\nunderstanding by prompting us to an intelligible truth (De\ntrinitate 13.2). Thus, while no doubt faith in revelation\nprecedes rational insight into its true meaning, the decision about\nwhose authority to believe and whom to accept as a reliable witness is\nitself reasonable (De vera religione 45; Letter\n120.3). Even so, belief may of course be deceived (De\ntrinitate 8.6). In ordinary life, this is inevitable and mostly\nunproblematic. A more serious problem is the justification of belief\nin Scripture, which, for Augustine, is the tradition and authority\n(auctoritas, not potestas) of the Church (Contra\nepistulam fundamenti 5.6; Rist 1994: 245).\n5.4 Language and Signs\n\nAugustine\u2019s philosophy of language is both indebted to the\nStoic-influenced Hellenistic and Roman theories of grammar and highly\ninnovative (Rist 1994: 23\u201340; King 2014b). He follows the Stoics\nin distinguishing between the sound of a word, its meaning and the\nthing it signifies (De dialectica 5; De quantitate animae 66; cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus\nmathematicos 8.11\u201312 = 33B Long-Sedley), but he seems to\nhave been the first to interpret language as such as a system of signs\nand to integrate it into a general semiotics (Fuhrer 2018a: 1696; Cary\n2008b; Mayer 1969 and 1974). In his handbook of biblical exegesis and\nChristian rhetoric, De doctrina christiana (1.2;\n2.1\u20134), Augustine divides the world into \u201cthings\u201d\nand \u201csigns\u201d (i.e., things that, apart from being what they\nare, signify other things) and furthermore distinguishes between\n\u201cnatural\u201d or involuntary signs (e.g., smoke signifying\nfire) and voluntary or \u201cgiven\u201d signs (a distinction akin,\nbut not equivalent, to the older discussion about nature or convention\nas the origin of language). Language is defined as a system of given\nsigns by means of which the speaker signifies either things or her\nthoughts and emotions (Enchiridion 22). In the exegetical\nframework of De doctrina christiana, the \u201cthing\u201d\nsignified by the verbal signs of Scripture is God, the Supreme Being.\nAugustine therefore begins with a sketch of his theology and ethics\ncentered around the notions of love of God and neighbor before he sets out his biblical hermeneutics which,\nagain, posits love as the criterion of exegetical adequacy (Pollmann\n1996; Williams 2001). The words of the Bible are external signs\ndesigned to prompt us to the more inward phenomenon of love and,\nultimately, to God who is beyond all language and thought. This may be\ngeneralized to the principle that external\u2014verbal and\nnon-verbal\u2014signs operate on a lower ontological level than the\ninward and intelligible truth they attempt to signify and that they\nare superseded in true knowledge which is knowledge not of signs but\nof things. This holds not only for words, even the words of Scripture,\nbut also for the sacraments and for the Incarnation of Christ\n(Contra epistulam fundamenti 36.41). Augustine\u2019s most\nsustained discussion of language, the early dialogue De\nmagistro, asks how we learn things from words and relates\nlinguistic signification to the epistemology of illumination (Nawar\n2015). After a long discussion of how verbal signs signify things or\nstates of mind and how they relate to other signs, it turns out,\nrather surprisingly, that we do not learn things from signs at all\nbecause in order to understand the meaning of a sign we already have\nto be acquainted with the thing signified. This is ultimately a\nversion of Meno\u2019s paradox, and Augustine solves it by\nintroducing the metaphors of the inner teacher and of illumination,\ni.e., by means of an internalist theory of learning recognizable as a\nNeoplatonic interpretation of Platonic anamnesis (De magistro\n38\u201340).\n This does not mean that words are useless. They inform us about\nthings that are inaccessible to direct acquaintance and thus generate\ntrue belief; most importantly, they admonish us to\n\u201cconsult\u201d the inner teacher and to understand things by\nourselves (this, according to Augustine, is the whole point of the\nSocratic dialogue). This goes even for the acquisition of language\nitself: We understand the sign \u201cbird-catching\u201d, not simply\nby being shown a person engaged in that activity and being told that\nhe is signified by that name, but by observing him and figuring out\nfor ourselves what \u201cbird-catching\u201d means (ib. 32; on this\nand Wittgenstein\u2019s criticism of what he took to be\nAugustine\u2019s view of language acquisition, see Matthews 2005:\n23\u201333). In the later books of De trinitate and in the\nsermons on the Trinity, Augustine frequently refers to a phenomenon\ncalled \u201cinner word\u201d, which he uses to explain the relation\nof the inner-Trinitarian Word or Logos from the Prologue of John (John\n1:1) to Christ incarnate. Just as the spoken word signifies a concept\nthat we have formed within our mind and communicates it to others, so\nChrist incarnate signifies the divine Logos and admonishes and assists\nus to turn to it (cf. De trinitate 15.20; De doctrina\nchristiana 1.12; Sermon 119.7; 187.3). In De\ntrinitate Augustine expands this to a theory about how the inner\nword or concept is formed (14.10; 15.25; cf. 15.43). The inner word is\ngenerated when we actualize some latent or implicit knowledge that is\nstored in our memory. It is not a sign, nor of linguistic nature\n(Augustine insists that it is neither Latin nor Greek nor Hebrew), but\nrather seems to be a kind of a-temporal intellectual insight that\ntranscends language (cf. De catechizandis rudibus 3).\nProperly speaking, then, the theory of the inner word is not a\nlinguistic theory at all.\n",
