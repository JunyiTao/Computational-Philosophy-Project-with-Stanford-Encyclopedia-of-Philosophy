    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Exemption rights\n2.1 Exemption rights\n\nPerhaps the most familiar type of cultural claim made against the\nstate is in the form of request for exemptions from rules and\nregulations that typically apply to all citizens. Exemption rights\nrespond to the fact that, in liberal democracies, laws and practices\nare meant\u2014genuinely\u2014to treat all citizens equally, but\nthat there are some which inadvertently impose disadvantage on certain\nminorities. The worry to be resolved is that minority citizens are\nunintentionally or accidentally burdened by the normal application of\ncertain laws (Levy 2000: 130), in ways that treat them unfairly, which\ncan be resolved by exemptions from certain laws and normal practices\n(Quong 2006; Gutmann 2003). The extension of exemption rights then is\nunderstood as a\n\n\na recognition of that difference, as an attempt not to unduly burden\nthe minority culture or religion en route to the laws\u2019\nlegitimate goals. (Levy 2000: 130)\n\n\nFor example, some Sikhs request exemption from\u00a0laws that require\nwearing motorcycle or construction-site helmets. Although Sikhism is a\nreligion, Sikhs describe the requirement that they wear a turban not\nquite as a religious requirement, but rather as a symbol of their\nfaith and commitment to Sikh values, as well as an expression of their\nidentity (Sikh Faith FAQs in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Without exemption from these laws, Sikhs would be excluded from\ntaking advantage of opportunities that are meant to be available to\nall citizens on an equal basis. The same is true of Indigenous\ncommunities, who have requested exemptions from generally applicable\nlaws that limit hunting and fishing, explaining that such limits\nundermine their traditional way of life, or make\u00a0it hard (or\nimpossible) for them to sustain themselves (Levy 2000: 128). Before\nSunday-closing laws were abandoned in Canada and the United States,\nreligious minorities were occasionally granted exemptions from them.\nIn these cases, as described above and without legally provided\nexemptions, people (usually minorities) must choose between\nparticipating in opportunities that should be available to all\ncitizens on an equal basis or to respect their (cultural)\nunderstanding of what their religion requires of them.\n\nThe request for exemption can be\u00a0lightly distinguished from the\nrequest for rule modification. As indicated, exemption requests are,\nas they sound, requests that individuals be exempted from certain\nrequirements that are meant to apply to all citizens equally;\nmodification requests ask for changes in existing, majority, practices\nto accommodate certain other, minority, practices. Sikhs sometimes\nrequest exemption from laws that would, otherwise, require them to\nremove their turban as above; in other cases, they request uniform\nmodifications, so that turbans are treated as one among several\navailable head coverings for those carrying out a specific\nrole.\u00a0The same is true of uniform modification requests made by\nMuslim women who cover their faces or heads, and Jewish men who wear\nyarmulkes, where uniforms have traditionally required an uncovered\nhead or face, or where they have required particular head coverings\n(as in the Sikh case, they may also be presented as requests for\nexemptions). Similarly, when observant Muslims request short breaks in\ntheir work day to pray at specific times of day, or when Jewish and\nMuslim students ask for changes in the provision of foods (to\naccommodate kosher and halal obligations) in school cafeterias, the\nrequest is for modification rather than exemption.\n\nIn most cases, the early failure of a legitimate law to modify or\nexempt new practices is unintentional. That is, the laws or practices\nin place were not adopted intentionally with the purpose of excluding,\nbut were rather adopted under the assumption that they treat the\nexisting population fairly. But widespread immigration has diversified\nmany populations in substantial ways. Immigrants often travel with\npractices and norms that are, when they arrive, unfamiliar to the\nstates they are joining, and as a result states are asked to modify\ncertain laws, and exempt newcomers from certain others. There may be\ncases where there are legitimate public reasons to persist in applying\ncertain laws in spite of the disadvantage they generate for newcomers.\nAs well, there are cases where states persist in demanding obedience\nto laws and practices that clearly disadvantage newcomers attempting\nto integrate, but where there are no good mitigating factors to\njustify persisting in the imposing of disadvantage (as when the Danish\ntown of Randers passed a law requiring that pork be served \u201con\nan equal footing with other foods\u201d in school cafeterias). In\nthese latter cases, the exclusionary impact of the laws is no longer\ninadvertent, and they are generally condemnable for perpetuating\nunnecessary and unjustified exclusion from political, economic and\nsocial spaces.\n\nIt is not always the case that individuals or groups claiming cultural\nrights to exemption and modification are immigrants, but that is often\nthe case. Indigenous communities ask for exemptions, as do certain\northodox religious communities. These cases will be discussed below in\nthe section focused on cultural preservation.\n",
