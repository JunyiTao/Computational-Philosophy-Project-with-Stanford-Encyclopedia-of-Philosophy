    "main_text": "Legitimacy || Democracy\n4.5 Democracy\n\nSome believe there is an intimate link between democracy and political\nlegitimacy, at least in the domestic context. They regard the\ndemocratic enactment of law, or at least the subjection of any source\nof law to democratic control, as a necessary condition of its\nlegitimacy, if not also a sufficient one. But even many of those who\ndo not treat democracy as a universally necessary or sufficient\ncondition for legitimacy\u2014such as advocates of the service\nconception or the salience principle\u2014accept that democratic\nlaw-making processes augment the legitimacy of the laws they produce.\nOf course, the proper characterization of democracy is itself a\ncontested matter\u2014ranging from simple majoritarianism, on the one\nhand, to sophisticated deliberative conceptions of democracy, on the\nother. For present purposes, however, we can take democracy to involve\nthe idea of participatory self-government, in which those subject to\nlaws participate as free and equals in deliberation and\ndecision-making leading to the enactment of laws.\n\nVarious difficult questions arise as to the relationship between\ninternational law and democracy, such as whether non-democratic states\nshould have full sovereign status or whether international law should\nencourage the spread of democracy around the globe, perhaps by\nrecognizing and upholding a human right to democracy (Franck 1992 and\n1995: ch.4; Dworkin 2013). However, two other questions are\nparticularly salient under the rubric of legitimacy: (1) should the\nprocess of international law-making be democratic?, and (2) can\ninternational legal norms enjoy legitimacy in the case of democratic\nstates that have not consented to be bound by them?\n\nRegarding the first question, it is obvious that existing systems for\nthe generation of international law (e.g., custom and treaties) are\nnot meaningfully \u201cdemocratic\u201d. International law is\ncreated by states, many of which are not themselves democratic, and\nthe process by which they create such law cannot itself be described\nas democratic. However, many writers have advocated introducing\ndemocratic features into international law-making. One example is\nRonald Dworkin, who canvassed the idea of establishing a world\nlegislative body through a Global Legislative Convention. The body\nwould operate by means of a four-majorities system. Proposed laws\nwould need to receive votes representing states with a majority of the\nUN General Assembly\u2019s members\u2019 total populations, a\nmajority of votes in the General Assembly, a majority of votes in the\nSecurity Council, and a majority of votes among the Council\u2019s\npermanent members (Dworkin 2013: 28). One potential concern about this\nproposal is that it operates via majorities among states\n(weighted to some extent by their populations), rather than among all\nindividual persons throughout the globe. This worry may be mitigated\nsomewhat if we suppose that the states participating in this process\nmust themselves be sufficiently representative of their\npopulations.\n\nOthers, however, defend more ambitious schemes that involve the direct\nrepresentation of the global population. For example, Thomas Franck\nproposed towards the transformation of the UN General Assembly into a\nbicameral forum, with one chamber for states and another being\ndirectly elected (Franck 1995: Part V; for other such proposals of\nglobal democratic institutions, including a global direct\n\u201cvirtual\u201d democratic assembly, see Held 1995; Falk &\nStrauss 2000). Democratic reforms of this sort attract scepticism not\nonly on the basis that states are unlikely to cede power to a global\ndemocratic populace, but also because genuine democracy requires forms\nof entitlement, deliberation and solidarity (e.g., equal rights of\nparticipation, a robust civil society (e.g., mass political parties to\nmediate between individuals and officials, concern for a common good,\netc) that cannot be realistically replicated at the global level). In\nthis sceptical vein, Thomas Christiano has written that global\ndemocracy\n\n\nis highly unlikely to succeed given the weakness of global civil\nsociety and it is highly unlikely to be legitimate given the\nunevenness of stakes and given the high chance of permanent\nminorities. (Christiano 2010: 137)\n\n\nHe prefers, instead, the idea of a fair association of democratic\nstates operating on the basis of a constrained principle of consent.\n(For a discussion of international legitimacy from a neo-republican\nperspective that incorporates democratic elements, see Pettit\n2010).\n\nThe second question, identified above, is whether democratic states,\nin particular, have an obligation to obey international legal norms\nthey have not consented to or incorporated into their domestic law\nthrough democratic procedures. Recent international law, especially\nthrough expansive conceptions of customary international law and\njus cogens, has significantly increased the number of norms\nwhich bind states, even in the absence of their consent. This has\ncreated a backlash, especially among \u201cneo-conservative\u201d\ncommentators who deny that any such laws can bind a constitutional\ndemocracy, at least in the absence of its consent expressed by means\nof internal democratic processes (Rabkin 2005; Kyl, Feith, & Fonte\n2013). But this sort of concern extends beyond neo-conservative\ndefenders of American exceptionalism; for example, Martha Nussbaum, a\nleading liberal political philosopher, has argued that domestic\ndemocratic endorsement is a condition of international law\u2019s\nlegitimacy (Nussbaum 2018\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nGiven that existing international law-making processes are not even\nweakly democratic, and that there is no realistic prospect that they\nwill become so anytime in the foreseeable future, why should they be\nregarded as binding on democratic states in the absence of their\nconsent or democratic incorporation into their own legal systems? The\nproblem of integrating international and democratic governance is one\nof the most serious challenges facing us today, and it is echoed in\nsimilar challenges confronting regional governmental blocs, such as\nthe European Union, that assert authority over their constituent\ndemocratic member states.\n\nOne line of response begins by arguing that democracy is not the\nultimate touchstone of legitimacy, whether of international or\ndomestic law, and that, for example, consent theory, the service\nconception of legitimate authority, or the principle of salience can\njustify the international legal order\u2019s legitimacy even in\nrelation to democratic states. This line of thought leaves unaddressed\nspecific worries regarding how intrusive international law can be with\nrespect to the decision-making of democratic states without\ncompromising or forfeiting its claim to legitimacy or causing undue\ndamage to domestic democratic governance. For a sophisticated attempt\nto articulate ways of arriving at an acceptable balance between the\ngoods of international law and constitutional democracy, see Buchanan\nand Powell 2008. A notable element of their account is the defence of\n\u201cprinciple M\u201d, i.e.,\n\n\nwhere the acceptance of international law by a constitutional\ndemocracy can be reasonably expected to result in constitutional\nchanges\u2014significant alterations in constitutional\nstructures or significant diminutions in political\nself-determination\u2014then, as with other constitutional changes\n(such as consensual secession, accession to a federation, or\ndevolution from a centralized state), there is a strong presumption\nthat public constitutional deliberation and popular choice are\nrequired.
