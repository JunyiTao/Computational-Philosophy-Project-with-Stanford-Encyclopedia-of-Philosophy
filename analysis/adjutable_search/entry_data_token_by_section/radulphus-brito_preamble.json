    "main_text": "\n\nRadulphus Brito (\u2020 1320/21) was an important thirteenth-century\nmaster of arts at the University of Paris. He was part of the group of\nmedieval masters who later came to be known as the modistae,\nprincipally because of their common appeal to the notion of modes of\nsignifying (modi significandi) in their accounts of\ngrammatical congruence. Brito\u2019s philosophical work is largely\nunexplored, even though it is a crucial link between the philosophical\ndiscussions of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. Among\nother things, he richly contributed to the development of medieval\nlogic and philosophy of language. In fact, one can fairly consider his\nlogic of intentions to be the pinnacle of the development of\nthirteenth-century Aristotelian logic. Brito was a prolific author,\nwho commented on nearly all the Aristotelian corpus. Almost his entire\nphilosophical work is extant, although most of it is unedited.\n",
