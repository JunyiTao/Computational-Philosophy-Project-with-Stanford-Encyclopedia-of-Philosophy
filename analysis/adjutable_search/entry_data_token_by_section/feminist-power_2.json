    "main_text": "Power as Domination\n3. Power as Domination\n\nYoung\u2019s critique of the distributive model points toward an\nalternative way of conceptualizing power, one that understands power\nnot as a resource or critical social good, but instead views it as a\nrelation of domination. Although feminists have often used a variety\nof terms to refer to this kind of relation \u2013 including\n\u201coppression,\u201d \u201cpatriarchy,\u201d\n\u201csubjection,\u201d and so forth \u2013the common thread in\nthese analyses is an understanding of power as an unjust or\nillegitimate power-over relation. In the remainder of this entry, I\nuse the term \u201cdomination\u201d simply to refer to unjust or\noppressive power-over relations. In this section, I discuss the\nspecific ways in which feminists with different political and\nphilosophical commitments \u2013 influenced by phenomenology, radical\nfeminism, Marxist socialism, intersectionality theory,\npost-structuralism, postcolonial and decolonial theory, and analytic\nphilosophy \u2013 have conceptualized domination.\n",
