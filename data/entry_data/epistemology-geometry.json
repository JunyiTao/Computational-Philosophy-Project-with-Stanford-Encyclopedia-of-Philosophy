    "preamble": "\n\nGeometrical knowledge typically concerns two kinds of things:\ntheoretical or abstract knowledge contained in the definitions,\naxioms, theorems, and proofs in a system of geometry; and some\nknowledge of the external world, such as is expressed in terms of a\nsystem of physical geometry. The nature of the relation between the\nabstract geometry and its practical expression has also to be\nconsidered.\n\nThis essay considers various theories of geometry, their grounds for\nintelligibility, for validity, and for physical interpretability in\nthe period largely before the advent of the theories of special and\ngeneral relativity in the 20th century. It turns out that a\ncomplicated interplay between two basic properties of lines, being\nshortest and being straightest, is at work in many stages.\n\nBefore the 19th century only one geometry was studied in\nany depth or thought to be an accurate or correct description of\nphysical space, and that was Euclidean geometry. The 19th\ncentury itself saw a profusion of new geometries, of which the most\nimportant were projective geometry and non-Euclidean or hyperbolic\ngeometry. Projective geometry can be thought of as a deepening of the\nnon-metrical and formal sides of Euclidean geometry; non-Euclidean\ngeometry as a challenge to its metrical aspects and implications.\n\nBy the opening years of the 20th century a variety of\nRiemannian differential geometries had been proposed, which made\nrigorous sense of non-Euclidean geometry. There were also significant\nadvances in the domain of abstract geometries, such as those proposed\nby David Hilbert. It follows that the terms \u2018geometry\u2019 and\n\u2018physical space\u2019 do not have simple meanings in the\n19th century, and changing conceptions of these terms do\nnot follow a simple pattern of refinement. Their inter-relations\ntherefore also have a complicated history.\n\nGeometry has been a school of systematic logical thinking, with\nEuclid\u2019s work taken to be the paradigm of a well-founded science\nfor millennia, but with a sudden change of views around 1900. It has\nalso been a place of privilege for the elaboration of mathematical\nmethods, from synthetic to analytic treatments, algebraic\ndevelopments, the rise of structuralism, and more. Contemplating the\ndevelopment of geometry through the ages, one can see how it started\nas the study of figures (and their measurement) to become the study of\nspace, and ended up being the study of spatial structures \u2013 from\nthe most basic topology, to n-manifolds, to the geometries\npicked up by physicists.\n\nAt the same time, geometry has posed fundamental epistemological\nproblems, and has been a decisive locus of philosophical debate. One\nmay quickly mention: 1, the problem of certainty and apriority of\ngeometric knowledge, linked to the question \u2013 one geometry, or\nmany? 2, the problem of the role of intuition (was Kant right? is the\naxiom of parallels intuitively grounded?) 3, the problem of\nidealization, concerning the relation between perfect geometric\nfigures and their real instantiations; 4, the shifting conceptions of\nthe interrelation between mathematics and natural science.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Epistemological issues in Euclid\u2019s geometry\n\nA detailed examination of geometry as Euclid presented it reveals a\nnumber of problems. It is worth considering these in some detail\nbecause the epistemologically convincing status of Euclid\u2019s\nElements was uncontested by almost everyone until the later\ndecades of the 19th century. Chief among these problems are\na lack of clarity in the definitions of straight line and plane, and a\nconfusion between shortest and straightest as a, or the, fundamental\ngeometrical property. (See the many comments collected in\nHeath\u2019s edition of Euclid\u2019s Elements.) The\nimplications for the parallel postulate will be treated separately,\nsee the section on \n Non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe first four Books of Euclid\u2019s Elements are about\nstraight lines and circles, but it is well known that the concept of a\nstraight line receives only a most unsatisfactory definition. A line\nis said to be \u201ca breadthless length\u201d, and a straight line\nto be a line \u201cwhich lies evenly with the points on\nitself\u201d. This may help convince readers that they share a common\nconception of the straight line, but it is no use if unexpected\ndifficulties arise in the creation of a theory\u2014as we shall\nsee.\n\nTo those who decided to read the Elements carefully and see\nhow the crucial terms are used, it became apparent that the account is\nboth remarkably scrupulous in some ways and flawed in others. Straight\nlines arise almost always as finite segments that can be indefinitely\nextended, but, as many commentators noted, although Euclid stated that\nthere is a segment joining any two points he did not explicitly say\nthat this segment is unique. This is a flaw in the proof of the first\ncongruence theorem (I.4) which says that if two triangles have two\npairs of sides equal and the included angle is equal then the\nremaining sides of the triangles are equal.\n\nTheorem I.4 is interesting in another way. Theorem I.2 carries a\nscrupulous, and by no means obvious, proof that a given line segment\nin a plane may be copied exactly with one of its end points at any\nprescribed point in the plane. Theorem I.4 properly requires a proof\nthat an angle may likewise be copied exactly at an arbitrary point,\nbut this Euclid cannot provide at this stage (one is given in I.23,\nwhich, however, builds on these earlier results). He therefore gave a\nbald claim that one triangle may be copied exactly in an arbitrary\nposition, which makes one wonder why such care was expended on I.2. In\nfact, the whole concept of motion of figures was to become a prolonged\ntopic of discussion in Arabic/Islamic times. (On deduction in Euclid,\nsee Mueller 1981.)\n\nA plausible reading of Elements Book I is that a straight\nline can be understood as having a direction, so that there is a\nstraight line in every direction at every point and only one straight\nline at a given point in a given direction. The parallel postulate\nthen says that lines which cross a given line in equal angles point in\nthe same direction and do not meet. But this must be regarded as an\ninterpretation, and one that requires quite some work to make\nprecise.\n\nDirection is, nonetheless, a more plausible candidate than distance;\nEuclid did not start with the idea that the straight line joining two\ndistinct points is the shortest curve joining them. The relevant\nprimitive concept in the Elements is that of equality of\nsegments, such as all the radii of a given circle. Euclid stated as\nCommon Notion 4 that if two segments can be made to coincide then they\nare equal, and (in the troublesome I.4) he used the converse, that if\ntwo segments are equal then they can be made to coincide. Segments are\nsuch that either one is smaller than the other or they are equal, and\nin I.20 Euclid showed that \u201cin any triangle two sides taken\ntogether in any manner are greater than the remaining one.\u201d This\nresult has become known as the triangle inequality, and it goes a long\nway to proving that the line segment joining any two distinct points\nis the shortest curve through those points. Once the parallel\npostulate is introduced Euclid showed that opposite sides of a\nparallelogram are equal, and so the distance between a pair of\nparallel lines is a constant.\n\nBut there is another weakness in the Elements that is also\nworth noting, although it drew less attention, and this is the nature\nof the plane. The plane has another sub-standard definition, evidently\nmodelled on that of the line: \u201ca plane surface is a surface\nwhich lies evenly with the straight lines on itself\u201d (and,\nunsurprisingly, \u201ca surface is that which has length and breadth\nonly\u201d). After that, the word \u2018plane\u2019 is not\nmentioned in the first four Books, although they are solely concerned\nwith plane geometry. When Euclid turned to solid geometry in Book IX,\nhe began with three theorems to show successively that a straight line\ncannot lie partly in a plane and partly not, that if two straight\nlines cut one another they lie in a plane and every triangle lies in a\nplane, and that if two planes meet then they do so in a line. However,\nhe can only be said to claim these results and make them plausible,\nbecause he cannot use his definition of a plane to prove any of them.\nThey do, however, form the basis for the next theorems: there is a\nperpendicular to a plane at any point of the plane, and all the lines\nperpendicular to a given line at a given point are on a plane.\n\nOnce again, I.4 is problematic. Consider, for the purpose of a\nreduction ad absurdum, that one has two triangles, \\(ABC\\)\nand \\(A'BC\\) on the same side of their common base \\(BC\\), and such\nthat \\(BA = BA'\\) and \\(CA = CA'\\). It is intended to show that\ntherefore the vertices \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) coincide, and for this one\nmust, as Gauss observed (in unpublished remarks, see Gauss\nWerke 8, 193), use the fact that the triangles lie in the\nsame plane. A good definition of a plane is required, one that allows\nthis result to be proved.\n1.1 The question of diagrammatic constructions\n\nEuclid\u2019s treatment of geometry has, through the ages, been\ncelebrated as a perfect deductive presentation of a science, and\ncertainly Euclid made great efforts to obtain a most careful logical\nchain of truths. Book I in particular is impressive (see Lambert 1786,\nMueller 1981). Yet his proof-method gives a central role to diagrams,\nfor which reason Euclid\u2019s work came under severe criticism in\nthe late nineteenth century. This is because, from the early\neighteenth century, there was a gradual dominance of algebraic methods\nand a process of de-geometrization of mathematics, which evolved into\nthe so-called \u201carithmetization\u201d of mathematics. Diagrams\nwere demoted to the role of mere auxiliaries in mathematical\nreasoning, and a careful logical presentation of axioms and proofs was\nimplemented. One result of this movement would be Hilbert\u2019s\nwork, examined below.\n\nIt seems nevertheless true that the origins of geometric thinking\nhave, in different cultures, always been associated with visuo-spatial\nreasoning, and in particular with figures and diagrams. This is a key\nreason for the celebrated beauty and appeal of geometry. Kant came\nclose to capturing the spirit of Euclid\u2019s style of work when he\ninsisted that mathematical proof is based on the \u201cconstruction\nof concepts\u201d in intuition. The geometer works with carefully\ndefined concepts, for which Euclid always shows how to construct\ninstances (thus, e.g., proposition 1 shows how to construct an\nequilateral triangle given a line segment, and prop. 31 how to\nconstruct a parallel to a given line). But, as Kant emphasized in a\nfamous passage of the Critique, logical analysis of the\nconcepts could never provide the means of proof \u2013 an appeal to\nthe construction (say, of a triangle) is required, offering a concrete\ninstance either in empirical intuition (an external representation) or\nin pure intuition. Next, on the basis of the postulates, new elements\nare incorporated into the construction, which make it possible to\ninterconnect concepts and obtain new results. So it is that one can\nprove diagrammatically, e.g., that the angles of a triangle add up to\n180\u00ba (which, by the way, requires an appeal to the parallel\npostulate).\n\nThe proof of prop. 1 has famously been objected for having a\ngap. Given a segment \\(AB\\), an equilateral triangle is constructed by\ndrawing two circles with \\(AB\\) as radius, one centered on \\(A\\) and\nthe other centered on \\(B\\). The objection is that Euclid has no\ncontinuity principle, hence the existence of point \\(C\\) (the intersection\nof both circles) is not warranted. But such an objection ignores the\nproper role of diagrammatic reasoning in Euclid.  Manders (2008) has\nprovided an insightful analysis of how information is obtained from\ntext and diagram in the first books of the Elements, in careful\ndistribution of roles, which led him to distinguish between exact\ninformation (from text only) and co-exact information (taken from the\ndiagram). Notice that a diagram is not just a figure, but a reasoning\ntool, a semiotic element with rules of manipulation \u2013 and,\naccording to Manders, careful (implicit) rules for the extraction of\ninformation. For further details on this topic, see the entry on\n diagrams, sections 4.2 and 4.3. \n\nIn this connection it is worth mentioning a famous fallacious proof\nthat all triangles are isosceles, which Klein made well known. One can\nshow that this pseudo-proof violates the rules of the game of Euclid,\nextracting exact information from the diagram, which is never allowed.\nOn the other hand, one should notice that Euclid\u2019s postulates\nare not so much axioms in the Hilbertian sense, as rules of\nconstruction that are applied in the elaboration and handling of\ndiagrams. Most of Euclid's postulates establish that certain\nconstructions can be performed, the drawing of a line or a circle, the\nmeeting of two lines under certain conditions (this last is Euclid's\nown formulation of postulate 5 \u201cof the parallels\u201d).  As\nfor the central role of such rules of construction in Ancient\ngeometry, it is interesting to remark that the Greeks said\n\u2018diagramma\u2019 to mean a mathematical proposition. \n\nBut geometric knowledge, which began close to visual thinking\n(Giaquinto 2007) and the practical manipulation of symbols, i.e.,\ndiagrams as concrete representations, gradually evolved to become a\nmore abstract edifice. Already with Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius\nthere is an effort to give form to well-crafted concepts, which make\nprecise, ideal, and general what was suggested by intuition; likewise,\nthe way of handling diagrams is anything but naive (see e.g. prop. 10\nin Book III, but also props. 7, 14 or 27 in Book I). And in due\ncourse, a critical stage was attained, when the assumptions of\ngeometric knowledge were made explicit and subjected to scrutiny,\nlooking for deeper foundations and for alternatives. At this stage,\nrepresented above all by the nineteenth century, the diagram had to be\nrelegated in favor of more explicit, abstract, relational methods for\nthe analysis of theoretical assumptions and developments.\n1.2 Synthetic method vs. measurement\n\nLet us say that a purely synthetic geometry is one that deals with\nprimitive concepts such as straight lines and planes in something like\nthe above fashion. That is, it takes the straightness of the straight\nline and the flatness of the plane as fundamental, and appeals to the\nincidence properties just described. It is resistant to the idea of\ntaking distance as a fundamental concept, or to the idea of replacing\nstatements in geometry by statements about numbers (say, as\ncoordinates), although it is not hostile to coordinate geometry being\nerected upon it.\n\nLet us also say for present purposes that a metrical geometry is one\nin which distance is a primitive concept, so line segments can be said\nto have the same length, congruent figures have corresponding sides\nequal in length, and geometrical transformations preserve lengths. We\ncan also allow that similarities are allowed: these are\ntransformations that produce scale copies of figures. (No theorem in\nEuclid\u2019s Elements depends on the actual size of a\nfigure: any theorem that applies to one figure applies to all its\nscale copies.)\n\nElementary geometry in the modern West moved in a confused way towards\nmaking distance the primary primitive concept, while often maintaining\nthe Euclidean emphasis on straightness, thus frequently muddling the\nimplications of the different concepts. A notable example of this\nbeing nonetheless productive was John Wallis\u2019s argument in\ndefence of the parallel postulate (given as a lecture in 1665 and\npublished in Wallis 1693). It rested, as he realised, on the ability\nto make arbitrary scale copies of a triangle, and this seems to be the\nfirst time that the equivalence was recognised between these two\nsystems:\n\nEuclid\u2019s Elements with the parallel postulate\nEuclid\u2019s Elements without that postulate but with\nthe assumption that arbitrary similar figures exist added.\n\n\nIn the Encylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique (1784: vol. 2,\n132), d\u2019Alembert defined geometry as the science of the\nproperties of extension, i.e., of bodies (and surfaces and lines)\nconsidered as merely extended and figured. Its principles are founded,\nin his view, on truths so evident that it is not possible to contest\nthem. A line (in the sense of a curve) is one-dimensional, and the\nshortest line joining two points is the straight line. Parallel lines\nare lines that, however far they are extended, will never meet because\nthey are everywhere equidistant. D'Alembert was not keen on\naxiomatic presentation of the material, and so it was also with many\nother eighteenth-century authors.\n\nAdrien-Marie Legendre was a mathematician sympathetic to the didactic\naims of the Elements but not to its original formulations. He\nwrote several different versions of his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1794) with a view to restoring\n\"Euclidean rigour\" in the teaching of geometry, which in his\nview had been corroded by texts, such as one by Clairaut (1741), that\nrelied on notions of self-evidence. They differ largely, as he had to\nadmit, in their unsuccessful attempts to deduce the parallel\npostulate.\n\nIn all these editions Legendre took a firmly metrical point of view,\ntaking as given algebra and the theory of proportions. His opening\ndefinition of the first edition proclaimed that \u201cGeometry is a\nscience that has as its object the measure of extent\u201d. Extent,\nhe explained, has three dimensions, length, breadth, and height; a\nline is a length without breadth, its extremities are called points\nand a point therefore has no extent. A straight line is the shortest\npath from one point to another; surfaces have length and breadth but\nno height or depth; and a plane is a surface in which if two arbitrary\npoints are joined by a straight line this line lies entirely in the\nsurface. Legendre then set out to prove even some truths that Euclid\nhad preferred to assume, such as (Legendre\u2019s first result): any\ntwo right angles are equal. The notion of congruence was central to\nhis approach, and familiar congruence theorems follow in each edition\nuntil the parallel postulate could no longer be ignored. Once the\nexistence of parallel lines was assured Legendre argued that they were\nequidistant.\n\nIn fact, Legendre\u2019s attempts to restore rigour to the treatment\nof elementary geometry was no better than Euclid\u2019s, and in some\nways worse, not only because his attempts to prove the parallel\npostulate inevitably failed, but because he smuggled more into his\naccount than he realised. But its chief significance for present\npurposes is that it exemplifies the attempt to ground elementary\ngeometry on a concept of distance, or more precisely, on the idea that\na straight line is the curve of shortest distance between any of its\npoints. Distance itself is not defined.\n\nJoseph Fourier, in a discussion with Monge, also took the concept of\ndistance as fundamental, and began with three-dimensional space. He\nthen employed equidistance to define successively the sphere, the\nplane (as the points equidistant from two given points) and the line\n(as the points equidistant from three given points). This did at least\ngive him definitions of these previously troubling concepts (see\nBonola 1912, 54).\n\nTo conclude: a reasonable view at the time would have been that\nmetrical geometry needed to put its house in order, and it probably\ncould not do so by grafting the concept of distance onto a structure\nmodelled on Euclid\u2019s Elements. This is an awkward\nposition for traditional geometry to be in, and it may have opened\npeople\u2019s minds to the possibilities of alternatives. Certainly,\ntwo were to be produced. One, projective geometry, amplified and\nimproved the synthetic side of geometry. The other, non-Euclidean\ngeometry, was a new and challenging metrical geometry. But before we\nlook at them, we turn to contemporary philosophical discussions of\ngeometry.\n2. Epistemological issues in applied geometry\n\nIt is a useful over-simplification to say that around 1800 the view\nwas that there is one physical space, and that this space is described\nby the geometry in Euclid\u2019s Elements, which is the only\ncandidate for such a task. Disputes concerned the rigorous\npresentation of this geometry and the limits of its application to the\nphysical world. The nature of the knowledge that geometry provided was\nalso a matter of some discussion.\n\nTraditionally, geometry had been regarded as a paradigm of truth,\ncertainty, and justification. This can be found e.g. in many authors\nof the seventeenth century. Descartes was ready to criticize the\nEuclidian method for a certain stiffness, which made it difficult to\nfind the solution of new problems, and he sought to alleviate it by\ncombining algebra and geometry; yet, even so, he always emphasized the\nclarity and evidence of geometry and its demonstrations. According to\nPascal, geometry was the perfect illustration of the methods of\ndemonstrating truths, and of establishing a body of propositions in\nmethodical order. Leibniz, Spinoza, and others, continued taking\nmathematics as a model for philosohical discourse.\n\nLocke (see the entry on\n Locke)\n took from the Aristotelian tradition the idea that Euclidean geometry\nand rational theology are the exemplars of scientific knowledge, but\nsought to ground his philosophy in intuitive, demonstrative, and\nsensitive kinds of knowledge. Intuitive knowledge is what is grasped\nimmediately; demonstrative knowledge avails itself of the intermediate\nsteps of a proof, as in geometry. Both these forms of knowledge are\ncertain. Sensitive knowledge is not certain: it is what we learn\nthrough our senses, it presents effects but not causes, it is at best\npartial and may be deceptive. Space can be thought of as composed of\nall (actual and possible) positions of objects; pure space is space\nwith all solid bodies removed, and distance the primitive concept we\nuse to discuss the separation between bodies.\n\nLocke offered arguments against innatist interpretations of our\nknowledge of space and figures, emphasizing the primary role of\nexperience (see the entry on Molyneux problem). Yet in his An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) Locke asserted\nthat\n\n\n\u2026the idea of a right-lined triangle necessarily carries with it\nan equality of its angles to two right ones. Nor can we conceive this\nrelation, this connexion of these two ideas, to be possibly mutable,\nor to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of choice made it thus, or\ncould make it otherwise. (Essay IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560)\n\n\nSensitive knowledge of the corresponding objects, however, could never\nhave this degree of certainty, and because our knowledge derives from\nour knowledge of objects it would seem that scientific knowledge of\nspace is of a different kind from our knowledge of geometry. Thus, for\nLocke, Euclidean geometry provided one kind of knowledge, and\nexperience and scientific experiment, another. Indeed, one might say\nthat an epistemological gap remains to this day in philosophy in the\nform of a distinction between empirical and a priori knowledge that is\nstill widely recognised.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) (see the\nentry\n Kant\u2019s views on space and time)\n the situation is more complicated or sophisticated. Kant introduced\nthe notion of a priori knowledge in contrast to a posteriori, and\nsynthetic knowledge in contrast to analytical knowledge to allow for\nthe existence of knowledge that did not rely on experience (and was\nthus a priori) but was not tautological in character (and therefore\nsynthetic and not analytic). The\ncontentious class of synthetic a priori statements includes the truths\nof Euclidean geometry; thus he ascribed certainty and necessity to\nEuclidean geometry. Kant associated geometric knowledge with the pure\nintution of space; to know that an isosceles triangle (i.e. with two\nequal sides) has two equal angles at the base, the mathematician must\nproduce a particular construction that makes the truth of the claim\ndemonstrable (see Critique, A 716, B 744).\n\nAmong the French philosophes, the dominant position in the 1740s was\nthe Cartesian one, which, as exemplified by Clairaut\u2019s\n\u00c9l\u00e9mens de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1741) was\nperhaps unduly na\u00efve in its insistence on clear and immediate\nideas. The position of d\u2019Alembert, in his articles in the\nEncylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique (1784), was more\nsophisticated. The objects of geometry are to be understood by\nabstracting from bodies every quality except that of being divisible\nand figured extents. Among these objects are lines, that lack breadth,\nand surfaces, that lack depth. Truths established about the objects of\ngeometry are purely abstract and hypothetical, because there is no\nsuch thing, for example, as a perfect circle. The demonstrated\nproperties can hold of actual circles only insofar as the actual\nobject approaches the state of being a perfect circle,\n\n\nThey are, in some sense, a limit and, if one can put it this way, the\nasymptote of physical truths, the term for those objects that approach\nas closely as one wishes without ever arriving at it exactly. (see\nEncylop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique II, 132)\n\n\nHowever, if mathematical theorems do not exactly hold in nature, these\ntheorems serve with more than sufficient precision in practice. To be\ndemonstrated with complete rigour they must be considered as holding\nof bodies in a state of abstract perfection that they do not really\nhave.\n\n\nThe curves studied in geometry are not perfectly straight nor\nperfectly curved, the surfaces are not perfectly flat nor perfectly\ncurved, but the more nearly they are so, the more they approach the\nstate of having those properties that one proves about lines exactly\nstraight or curved, and of surfaces exactly flat or curved.\n\n\nThese reflexions, d\u2019Alembert continued, will be enough to refute\nthe sceptics, who complain that geometrical objects do not really\nexist, and others ignorant of mathematics who regard it as a useless\ngame.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that philosophers found no problems in\nEuclid\u2019s Elements, but Hume, d\u2019Alembert, and\nothers of an empiricist persuasion qualified the applicability of the\ntheorems on the grounds that the objects of geometry might have no\ncorresponding objects in the world. Philosophers more open to the idea\nof a wide range of certain knowledge (as, for example, Kant) could\ngrant geometrical theorems the status of a priori truths that cannot\nbe other than they are.\n2.1 Implications of mechanics\n\nPhysical space was the na\u00efve, three-dimensional version of the\nspace of Euclid\u2019s Elements and of Cartesian\ncoordinatised three-dimensional geometry, and this was how Newton had\nregarded it in his Principia Mathematica (1687). It was\nconceived of as a neutral arena, unaffected by matter or forces, but\nconditioning the movements of physical bodies under various kinds of\nforces. Chief among these was the force of gravity, which\nmathematicians in the Cartesian tradition regarded as a mysterious,\neven unacceptable, concept when it was introduced, but which by the\nstart of the 19th century had been shown by Laplace to be\ncapable of dealing well with all the known motions of the solar\nsystem. As a consequence, gravity had become a natural, primitive\nconcept no longer in need of further explanation, and by 1800 it was\nreasonable of people who worked on the new theories of magnetism and\nelectricity to consider them as forces and to model them, where\nappropriate, on Newtonian gravity.\n\nPhysical space, as described by Newton in his Principia, is\nto be studied by passing from observations of bodies in motion\nrelative to one another and timed by an arbitrary clock to the\ncorresponding true motion in absolute space and time. As Newton put it\nat the end of his first Scholium, the purpose of his treatise was to\nshow\n\n\nhow to determine true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent\ndifferences, and, conversely, of how to determine from motions,\nwhether true or apparent, their causes and effects.\n\n\nThere was clearly no doubt in Newton\u2019s mind about the Euclidean\nnature of physical space, and indeed there seems to have been no\ndoubts among astronomers in the 17th or 18th century that\nspace was describable in the terms used in Euclid\u2019s\nElements. It is also likely that the growing recognition of\nthe merits of Newton\u2019s physics cemented a belief that space was\nthree-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, and to be described as if\nit was an infinite coordinate grid, thus exemplifying the\ntheorems\u2014if not precisely the definitions\u2014of the\nElements.\n\nThe interaction between geometrical aspects of physical space, and\nmechanical behaviour of bodies, is clear in the statement of\nNewton's first law (see the entry on inertial frames):\n\n\nEvery body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving\nuniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to\nchange its state by forces impressed.\n\n\nThere is also the result that a homogeneous spherical solid exerts the\nsame gravitational effect on other bodies as would an equal mass\nconcentrated at the centre of the body. That is to say, such bodies\nbehave in a way that is provably, and not merely approximately, the\nsame as point masses. In this way points and lines acquire physical\nsignificance in his theory of dynamics.\n\nIt was Laplace who gave the strongest argument for saying that\nphysical space obeys Euclidean geometry. In his Exposition du\nsyst\u00e8me du monde of 1796 (see Book V, Ch. V, p. 472) he\nadded an interesting note (quoted in Bonola 1912: 54) to say that\n\n\nThe attempts of geometers to prove Euclid\u2019s Postulate on\nParallels have been up till now futile. However, no one can doubt this\npostulate and the theorems which Euclid deduced from it. Thus the\nnotion of space includes a special property, self-evident, without\nwhich the properties of parallels cannot be rigorously established.\nThe idea of a bounded region, e.g., the circle, contains nothing which\ndepends on its absolute magnitude. But if we imagine its radius to\ndiminish, we are brought without fail to the diminution in the same\nratio of its circumference and the sides of all the inscribed figures.\nThis proportionality appears to me a more natural postulate than that\nof Euclid, and it is worthy of note that it is discovered afresh in\nthe results of the theory of universal gravitation.\n\n\nThis is strikingly similar to the view of Wallis well over a century\nbefore, although Laplace did not mention Wallis and may not have known\nof his discussion on the parallel postulate.\n\nAround 1800, therefore, it was generally true that problems with the\ntruth claims of Euclidean geometry had been located among the problems\nabout our knowledge of the external world. Confidence in philosophical\nand scientific circles in the validity of Euclidean geometry per se\nwas very high.\n3. Projective geometry\n\nIn the opinion of many in the 19th century, Euclidean\ngeometry lost its fundamental status to a geometry that was regarded\nas more general: projective geometry. (For an introduction to geometry\nin the 19th century, see Gray 2011. Projective geometry is\ndescribed in the entry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry,\n see also the essays by various authors in Bioesmat-Martagon 2011.)\nProjective geometry has its own foundational problem, akin to that of\ndistance in Euclidean geometry, which concerns the concept of\ncross-ratio, and we need to follow the moves to create projective\ngeometry as an independent subject, to define cross-ratio in this\nsetting, and to resolve the epistemological issues that are raised (an\nachievement associated with Klein\u2019s Erlangen Programme). We\nshall also see that the growth of projective geometry creates the\narena for Hilbert\u2019s axiomatisation of geometry.\n\nThe origins of this geometric theory lay in the 17th century, with\nDesargues and Pascal, but plane projective geometry took a particular\nboost from Jean Victor Poncelet\u2019s book of 1822 Trait\u00e9\ndes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures where he\nshowed the power of projective methods under the provocative\nformulation of non-metrical geometry. The fundamental character of the\nnew geometry resides in the way it can be thought of as capturing the\nsimplest properties of the straight line\u2014two distinct points\ndefine a unique line, two distinct lines meet in at most one\npoint\u2014while discarding the metrical concepts of distance and\nangle.\n\nPoncelet\u2019s claims for transformations of the plane that map\nlines to lines were rewritten by Chasles (1837) in a more rigorous way\nthat highlighted the invariance of cross-ratio. Consider \\(AB\\) to\nrepresent the distance between the two points. The cross-ratio of four\npoints \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on a line is defined to be\n\\(AB{\\cdot}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{\\cdot}CB\\), and if the points are mapped\nto \\(A'\\), \\(B'\\), \\(C'\\), \\(D'\\) respectively by a projective\ntransformation, then \n\n\\[ \\frac{AB\\cdot CD}{AD\\cdot CB} = \\frac{A'B'\\cdot C'D'}{A'D'\\cdot C'B'}. \\]\n\n\nHowever, this left the subject in the uncomfortable position of\nseeming to be more general than Euclidean geometry, because Euclidean,\nmetrical, transformations are projective transformations but not\nconversely, while still seeming to rely on a metrical concept in the\ndefinition of its fundamental invariant.\n\nThis issue was tackled in the 1840s and 1850s by Georg Karl Christian\nvon Staudt. His two books (1847, 1856\u20131860) attempted to give\nfoundations for projective geometry that made it an autonomous\nsubject, independent of Euclidean geometry. They were hard to read,\nand imperfect in a number of ways, but the task of creating a rigorous\ntheory could be seen for the first time as a matter of completing a\ntask already begun. Von Staudt argued that the transformations of\nplane projective geometry could map any triple of collinear points to\nany other, and any quadruple of points (no three of which were\ncollinear) to any other, but not any quadruple of collinear points to\nany other. He then made a detailed study of collinear quadruples. He\nalso made brief remarks about how Euclidean geometry could be obtained\nfrom projective geometry, and from these it could be seen that his\ntheory of collinear quadruples reduced to the familiar theory of\ncross-ratio as soon as the concept of Euclidean distance was added to\nprojective geometry. This insight was made clear and explicit by Felix\nKlein in a number of papers in the early 1870s. The first readable\ntextbook on projective geometry, and the one that gave it its name,\nwas Cremona\u2019s Elementi di geometria projettiva of 1873,\nand after that the subject swiftly rose to become the fundamental\nclassical geometry.\n\nIts basic concepts were the points, lines, and planes of a space that\nwas \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) enriched with what was often called a plane at\ninfinity, so that any two coplanar lines meet. Prior to\naxiomatisations of the theory at the end of the 19th\ncentury, point, line, and plane were basic concepts with an intuitive\ninterpretation that allowed for a ready passage between projective and\nEuclidean geometry. The allowed transformations of the geometry map\npoints to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes and preserve\ncross-ratio. They act transitively on the space, so no point, line, or\nplane is special, and therefore lines that are parallel in any finite\npart of the space may be mapped to intersecting lines and vice\nversa.\n\nIn its synthetic form the successes of projective geometry were\nlargely confined to the simplification it brought to the study of\nconics\u2014all non-degenerate conics (the circle, ellipse, parabola,\nand hyperbola) are projectively equivalent. In its algebraic form\nprojective geometry proved itself almost essential in the study of\nplane algebraic curves of any degree, and, extended to projective\nspaces of higher dimensions, to the study of algebraic surfaces. All\nthis contributed to the central importance attributed to a\nnon-metrical geometry based on little more than the concept of the\nstraight line and on the incidence properties of lines and planes.\n\nProjective geometry also possessed one startling feature, called\nduality, which stimulated epistemological reflections on its possible\nsource. In plane projective geometry it is possible to exchange the\nterms \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018line\u2019,\n\u2018coincident\u2019 and \u2018concurrent\u2019 and in this way\nobtain from a valid statement a new one. As a result all definitions,\ntheorems, and proofs in projective geometry have a dual character. The\ndual of the statement of Desargues\u2019 theorem and its proof, for\nexample, is the converse of the theorem and its proof. In three\ndimensions, the terms \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018plane\u2019 can\nbe exchanged in the same way, leaving \u2018lines\u2019\nunchanged. This raises intriguing epistemological issues: duality was\nregarded by Cremona as a law of logic; also, it is easy to conceive of\nthe plane as made up of points, but impossible to regard it\nintuitively as made up of lines. To make matters worse, space is\nthree-dimensional when regarded as made up of points, but\nfour-dimensional when made up of lines.\n3.1 Coordinate transformations; Kleinian geometry\n\nKlein\u2019s Erlangen Programme and what has become known as the\nKleinian view of geometry is described in the entry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry.\n It has come to stand as the principal source of the view that\ngeometry can be defined as a group acting on a space, and a\ngeometrical property is any property invariant under all the\ntransformations of the appropriate group.\n\nKlein advocated this view in a pamphlet published when he became a\nProfessor at the University of Erlangen in 1872 and other publications\nin journals in the 1870s in order to re-unify geometry. He presented a\nway of showing that metrical geometries, such as Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometry, and other geometries, such as inversive\ngeometry and birational geometry, can be regarded as special cases of\nprojective geometry (as can affine geometry, which he did not know\nabout in 1872).\n\nThe fundamental geometry was real projective geometry, say in two\ndimensions. In this geometry the space is real projective space, and\nthe group is the group of all projective transformations. Such a\ntransformation maps points to points, lines to lines, curves of degree\n\\(n\\) to curves of degree \\(n\\), and, importantly, the cross-ratio of\nfour collinear points is left unaltered by any projective\ntransformation. In the Kleinian viewpoint, this establishes that\npoints, lines, curves of degree \\(n\\), and the cross-ratio of four\ncollinear points are properties of the geometry.\n\nProjective geometry incorporated the other geometries in a variety of\nways. Klein indicated that one may seek to add to the list of\nconfigurations, in which case the group that keeps them invariant will\ngenerally be smaller than the principal group, or one may seek to\nenlarge the group, in which case the class of invariant configurations\nwill generally shrink. Klein succeeded in showing that non-Euclidean\ngeometry arises as a sub-geometry by confining attention to the\ninterior of a conic in projective space and to the subgroup that maps\nthe interior of that conic to itself (see Klein 1871, 1873).\n\nThe epistemological character of Klein\u2019s Erlangen Programme\nbecomes clearer when one looks at how it resolved the well-known\nnagging doubt about the definition of cross-ratio in projective\ngeometry. Klein\u2019s answer proceeded by analogy with lengths in\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean geometry. In those geometries, the\ncorresponding group preserves straight lines, and any point can be\nmapped to any other point, but there is no transformation in the group\nthat can map a line segment onto a proper sub-segment of itself. Any\narbitrary but fixed line segment (determined by two points) can\ntherefore be taken as unit of length and used to measure line\nsegments, by constructing arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it\nand arranging them as one would a ruler. Now to measure the length of\na segment \\(AB\\), one simply lays the point \\(A\\) at one end of the\nruler and sees where the point \\(B\\) falls on the ruler.\n\nKlein\u2019s insight, following von Staudt, was that an exactly\nsimilar argument involving quadruples of collinear points can be used\nto define cross-ratio in projective geometry. The projective group\npreserves straight lines, and any ordered triple of collinear points\ncan be mapped to any ordered triple of collinear points, and the map\nthat sends a given ordered triple of distinct points to another\nordered triple of distinct points is unique, but there is no\ntransformation in the group that can map a quadruple of four collinear\npoints onto an arbitrary such quadruple. Any arbitrary but fixed\ncollinear quadruple can therefore be taken as unit of\n\u2018size\u2019, and a complicated but not difficult argument\nallows one to produce arbitrary multiples and sub-multiples of it that\ncan be used to measure cross-ratios, by arranging as one would a\nruler. Rather than give the details, it is better to give this\nsuggestive illustration of why this can be done. Let the cross-ratio\nof the four collinear points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), \\(S\\) be measured by\nmapping the points onto the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on the\nreal line, where \\(A\\) is at the origin, \\(C\\) at \\(\\infty\\), and\n\\(D\\) at 1, so it is the position of \\(B\\) that determines the\ncross-ratio. This is uniquely determined, and if the length of \\(AB\\)\nis \\(x\\), we find that \\(AB{.}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{.}CB = x\\).\n\nIn the language of the time, length is a two-point invariant of the\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean group, and cross-ratio is a four-point\ninvariant of the projective group.\n3.2 Hilbert and others on axiomatic projective geometry\n\nProblems with some technical issues in projective geometry, and the\nrising standards of rigour at the end of the 19th century\nprovoked attempts to axiomatise the subject. The task was taken up by\nMoritz Pasch, and most energetically by Italian geometers Pieri,\nPeano, and others in the second half of the 19th century,\nand they succeeded in giving a rigorous account of real and complex\nprojective geometry in two and three dimensions (see Marchisotto and\nSmith 2007). But they managed at the same time to reduce the subject\nto a rigorous training for geometry teachers, and did not appreciate\nthe avenues for research that they had opened. It was left to David\nHilbert to revitalise the axiomatic approach to geometry (see Hallett\nand Majer 2004).\n\nHilbert had been introduced to a number of controversies about\nelementary projective geometry that concerned what results in what\nsettings implied what other results. The most notable concerned\nDesargues\u2019s theorem (see Arana and Mancosu 2012). In\n3-dimensional projective geometry, Desargues\u2019s theorem is a\nconsequence of the incidence axioms alone, but it is a theorem about\npoints and lines in a projective plane (and so in 2-dimensional\ngeometry) yet no-one had been able to derive it from the incidence\naxioms of 2-dimensional projective geometry. It had come to be\nsuspected that it might not be deducible from those axioms alone, and\nGiuseppe Peano was able to show that indeed it could not be deduced\nwithout some extra assumptions. Independently, Hilbert also gave an\nexample of a geometry meeting all the incidence axioms of\n2-dimensional projective geometry but in which Desargues\u2019s\ntheorem was false. It was replaced by the simpler example found by the\nAmerican mathematician and astronomer F.R. Moulton in all later\neditions of Hilbert\u2019s Grundlagen der Geometrie\n(1899).\n\nIn the axiomatic geometries that Hilbert put forward, the fundamental\nobjects (points, lines, planes) are not defined. Instead, Hilbert\nspecified the network of relations that links them, which determines\nhow they can be used and what can be said about them. He presented\nfive families of axioms, sorted according to the concepts they\ncodified. He then created a variety of geometries obeying a variety of\naxioms systems, and established the consistency of them by giving them\ncoordinates over suitable rings and fields\u2014often his geometries\nadmit many interpretations or models. Here Hilbert took advantage of\nhis expertise in the novel theories of number fields and rings. This\ngave these geometries all the consistency of arithmetic, and increased\nHilbert\u2019s interest in attempts to ground arithmetic in some form\nof set theory and logic.\n\nHilbert\u2019s approach thrived because he had come to realise that\nthere was a mathematics of axioms, a study of different but\ninter-related axiom schemes and their implications, and of the axioms\nand their possible interpretations (models). He employed this new\nmethod to solve questions about independence and consistency, hoping\nto find also new insights into simplicity, the solubility of\nmathematical problems, and decidability. Poincar\u00e9, in his\nreview (1902) of Hilbert\u2019s book, accepted the new geometries as\nvalid, but regretted that they were, as he put it, incomplete, because\nthey lacked a psychological component. By this he meant that they\ncould not be accommodated in his explanation of how we develop our\nknowledge of the geometry of physical space on the basis of\nexperience (see section 6.2 below). \n4. Non-Euclidean geometry\n\nInvestigations of the parallel postulate began in Greek times,\ncontinued in the Islamic world, and were undertaken in the early\nmodern West. But, for reasons which are still unclear, after around\n1800 it became easier for people to imagine that Euclid\u2019s\nElements might not be the only possible system of metrical\ngeometry. Among the factors that can help explain how the unthinkable\nbecame thinkable even outside the community of mathematicians was the\naccumulation of theorems based on assumptions other than the parallel\npostulate. It would seem that the production of novel, consistent\nconsequences of such a radical assumption, and the failure to find a\ncontradiction, inclined some people to contemplate that there might\nindeed be a whole geometry different from Euclid\u2019s. It may also\nbe relevant that this process coincided with the full assimilation of\nimaginary numbers (and the rise of complex function theory); indeed,\nLobachevskii called his theory \"Imaginary geometry\".\n\nA change in attitudes can be noticed already by the late 18th century.\nIn 1759 d\u2019Alembert called the problem of parallel lines\n\u201cle scandale des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie.\u201d In 1763, the dissertation of G. S.\nKl\u00fcgel examined a large number of attempts to prove the parallel\npostulate, concluding that they were all faulty: the result can be\nproven on the basis of axioms \"that are not clearer or more\nsecure than Euclid\u2019s,\" and thus Euclid was indeed right to\ninclude among the axioms \"a proposition that cannot be\ndemonstrated in correct form.\" Kl\u00fcgel's discussion\ncalled special attention to Saccheri\u2019s work (1733) as the most\ndetailed treatment in Modern times, and stimulated Lambert to do his\nown detailed work on the topic (1786). Later on, in 1816, Gauss\nrestated in print that the constantly increasing number of attempts to\nprove the postulate do not fill the gap, and that one should honestly\nand openly admit that \"in essence we have not come farther than\nEuclid 2000 years ago.\"\n\nPerhaps the signal example of this shift is the Law Professor F. K.\nSchweikart, who in 1818 sent Gauss via Gerling, a colleague and former\nstudent of his at the University of Marburg, an account of a geometry\nquite different from Euclid\u2019s. Schweikart\u2019s geometry was\naccepted by Gauss, who replied that all the properties of the new\ngeometry could be derived once a value was given for a constant that\nappeared in Schweikart\u2019s account. But on what grounds\u00a0Gauss\nhad accepted it, is less clear. As the years went by he came to be\nentirely confident that there was a new, two-dimensional geometry\ndifferent from Euclidean plane geometry. This geometry could be\ndescribed by formulae that he, following Lambert, would have seen were\nakin to those of spherical geometry. But he did not describe a\nthree-dimensional geometry of this kind, leaving open the possibility\nthat the two-dimensional geometry was some kind of formal, meaningless\noddity. On the other hand, in correspondence with Bessel he made it\nclear that he could not ascribe to Euclidean geometry the certainty he\ngave to arithmetic, which was a priori. Both he and Bessel kept open\nthe possibility that astronomical regions of space might fail to be\nEuclidean.\n\nCredit for the first fully mathematical descriptions of space in terms\nother than Euclid\u2019s must go to J\u00e1nos Bolyai in Hungary\nand Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevskii in Russia independently. Bolyai in\nhis \u201cAppendix scientiam spatii absolute veram\nexhibens\u201d (1832) and Lobachevskii in his Neue\nAnfangsgr\u00fcnde der Geometrie (1835) and again in his\nGeometrische Untersuchungen (1840) replaced the parallel\npostulate with the assumption that given a line L and a point not on\nthat line, there are many lines through the point that lie in the\nplane defined by L and the given point, but that do not meet the line\nL. Of these, as they then showed, one line in each direction is\nasymptotic to L, and these asymptotic lines divide the family of all\nthe other lines in the given plane and through the given point into\ntwo families: those that meet L, and those that do not. Much work then\nfollowed, famously similar in each case, in particular to show that in\nthe three-dimensional space described by their assumptions there is a\nsurface upon which Euclidean geometry holds, and to deduce the\nexistence of trigonometrical formulae describing triangles in the\nplane. These formulae resemble the corresponding formulae for\ntriangles on the sphere.\n\nAll this convinced both Bolyai and Lobachevskii that the new geometry\ncould be a description of physical space and it would henceforth be an\nempirical task to decide whether Euclidean geometry or non-Euclidean\ngeometry was true. Lobachevskii even attempted to determine the matter\nby astronomical observations, but there were significant\nmethodological difficulties and his results were utterly\ninconclusive.\n\nIt is, of course, true, that no amount of consistent deductions in the\nnew geometry rules out the possibility that a contradiction does\nexist, but the intriguing relationship of the new geometry to\nspherical geometry, and the existence of trigonometric formulae for\ntriangles strongly suggested that the new geometry was at least\nconsistent. Those who did accept it, and they were very few before the\n1860s, nonetheless may well have welcomed a better account than the\none Bolyai and Lobachevskii provided. Even so, many geometers were to\nfind the formulae convincing \u2018proofs\u2019 of the validity of\nthe new geometry even after the reformulations of Riemann and Beltrami\n(for example, Enriques in his major essay (1907) on the principles of\ngeometry).\n\nIt is not just that there are formulae, but that they hint at an\nalternative formulation of geometry, one in which the geometry\ndescribed in Euclid\u2019s Elements might prove to be but a\nspecial case. If there could be another way to define geometry, one\nthat would lead to these formulae in various cases, the way would be\nopen to rethink all of the questions about geometry that critical\nexamination had opened. The person best placed to do this in the 1830s\nand 1840s was Gauss: he knew very well what Bolyai and Lobachevskii\nhad done, and his differential geometry gave him the means to proceed,\nbut, curiously, he did not do so. In the early 1840s he wrote some\nnotes that show he could connect the new two-dimensional geometry with\ngeometry on a surface of constant negative curvature, but he did\nnothing with this observation.\n\nOn the other hand, the mere existence of formulae would not suffice to\nmake them geometrical in character. This need to give them a\ngeometrical grounding was recognised by Lobachevskii in his earliest\npublications, but being in Russian they were not read outside Russia\n(nor were they appreciated by Russian mathematicians). He dropped his\nconsiderations of this kind in his pamphlet of 1840, upon which much\nof his reputation depends to this day, but brought them back in his\nlast presentation, the Pang\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1856),\nwhich, however, did no better than the earlier versions.\n\nLobachevskii argued firstly that geometry was a science of bodies in\nspace, and that space is three-dimensional. The most primitive concept\nwas that of contact, and its opposite, a cut separating two bodies.\nTwo bodies not in contact are separated and a suitable third body in\ncontact with both of them measures the distance between them -- a\nconcept that was otherwise undefined. With it, however, he could\ndefine a sphere with its centre at a given point as the collection of\nall points equidistant from that given point. He then showed how to\ndefine a plane capturing the intuition that a plane is the collection\nof points in space that lie the same distance from two given points.\nIn his terms, given two points, a plane is the set of points common to\ntwo spheres of equal radius, one centred on one of the points and the\nother on the other. A line can be defined similarly using circles on\nthe same plane.\n\nWith the intuition that distance is the primitive concept comes a\ngreater appreciation of motion, or at least the results of being able\nto move objects around without altering them. One can imagine\ntransporting a rigid body around, say a cube with sides of unit\nlength, and using one of its sides to mark out lengths. We shall see\nlater that the possibilities inherent in this process occasioned a\nchicken-and-egg debate between Bertrand Russell and Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe new geometry posed a radical challenge to Euclidean geometry,\nbecause it denied traditional geometry its best claim to certainty, to\nwit, that it was the only logical system for discussing\ngeometry at all. It also exploited the tension known to experts\nbetween the concepts of straightest and shortest. But in other ways it\nwas conventional. It offered no new definitions of familiar concepts\nsuch as straightness or distance, it agreed with Euclidean geometry\nover angles, it merely offered a different behaviour of parallel lines\nbased on a difference in the distant behaviour of straight lines. Its\nproponents did not offer a sceptical conclusion. Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did not say: \u201cSee, there are two logical but\nincompatible geometries, so we can never know what is true.\u201d\nInstead, they held out the hope that experiments and observations\nwould decide. The epistemological price people would have to pay if\nastronomical observations had come down in favour of the new geometry\nwould, in a sense, have been slight: it would have been necessary to\nsay that straight lines have an unexpected property after all, but one\nonly detectable at very long distances. To be sure, many of the\ntheorems of geometry would then have to be reworked, and their\nfamiliar Euclidean counterparts would appear only as very good\napproximations. But that is broadly comparable to the situation\nNewtonian mechanics found itself in after the advent of special\nrelativity.\n5. Riemannian geometry\n\nThe much more significant change came with the arrival of Bernhard\nRiemann\u2019s great extension of Gaussian differential geometry.\nPrecisely, he found a way to define geometries starting from very\ngeneral concepts, and gradually leading (through more and more narrow\nhypotheses) to the known metric geometries. At the risk of sounding\nanachronistic, it can be argued that Riemann\u2019s\n\u201cconceptual\u201d style of work is a form of\nproto-structuralism. What he does is this: first, he introduces the\ngeneral structure of n-dimensional manifold, to then define a metric\nin the manifold (with the means of differential geometry, line element\nand Gaussian curvature). With all this in place, Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean geometries emerge as particular cases of 3-dimensional\nmanifolds, concrete forms of the general structure. And the\n\u201chypothesis\u201d that singles out these geometries, within the\ngeneral framework of Riemannian manifolds, is the physical assumption\nthat rigid bodies can move freely without deformation.\n\nSome of the epistemological issues are already raised with\nGauss\u2019s work (1828), so we turn to it first. Euler had shown\nlong before that, at each point P in a (smooth) surface, there\nare two so-called principal curvatures, the maximum and the\nminimum curvature of lines passing through P. These curvatures,\n\\(\\kappa_{1}\\) and \\(\\kappa_{2}\\), occur in plane sections\nperpendicular to each other and allow us to study the shape of the\nentire neighborhood of P. Now, Gauss\u2019s deep idea (which remarkably he\nfound while working on geodesy, i.e., surveying and mapmaking) was\nthat some properties of curved surfaces can be studied without regard\nfor the ambient space. And one of these key properties is the product\n\\(\\kappa_{1}\\kappa_{2}\\), called the Gaussian curvature of the surface\n(at a point). Thus, employing methods of differential analysis, he\nelaborated what is called an intrinsic geometry of surfaces. \n Gauss worked with coordinate systems within the surface\nitself, and considered the distance between points on the surface S\nalong lines contained entirely in S. Now, some surfaces\n\\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) can be obtained from each other by bending (without\nstretching); expressed more formally, there is an isometric map\nfrom \\(S_1\\) to \\(S_2\\), which means that the points on\n\\(S_1\\) are assigned points in \\(S_2\\) so that distances within the\nsurface \\(S_1\\) are the same as the distances of the corresponding\npoints in \\(S_2\\). (For instance, a plane can be so bent to form of\ncylinder; you may use a piece of paper to convince yourself.)  And\nGauss made the remarkable discovery that the Gaussian curvature of a\nsurface is an intrinsic property that remains invariant under\nisometric mappings. He was so happy about this result that he called\nit theorema eggregium, his \u2018outstanding theorem\u2019:\nif two surfaces \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) are isometric, then corresponding\npoints have the same Gaussian curvature. \n\nThe fact that the Gaussian curvature of a surface at a point is\nintrinsic means that it is entirely determined by measurements\nin the surface and does not involve any question of a third\ndimension or the ambient space embedding the surface. The property of\nGaussian curvature does not depend on how the surface is located in\nspace, but only on intrinsic properties of its metrics. That is to\nsay, important properties of curved surfaces remain invariant even if\none bends the surface isometrically (without breaking, stretching, or\nfolding it up). One such thing that remains invariant is the\ngeodesics on the surface, i.e., the lines of shortest distance\n(lying entirely on the surface). In the case of a cylinder, the\ngeodesics are the vertical lines, horizontal lines (circles), and\nhelices around it \u2014and these lines all come from straight lines\non the plane that is \u2018rolled up\u2019 to form the cylinder. \n\nGiven a metric, a differential formula for the distance ds\nbetween neighboring points (which is everywhere the same), the\ncurvature can be found. If, for example, the formula for distance is\nthat for a map of the sphere on the plane, the curvature will be found\nto be the reciprocal of the square of the radius of the sphere\n\\(1/R^2\\). A plane has the same Gaussian curvature as a cylinder, or\nalso as something close to a cone (that one may form from a cylinder,\nwithout breaking, stretching, or folding); they are locally isometric;\nalthough curved, the cylinder has zero curvature in Gauss\u2019s\ntechnical sense, just as does the plane, which is why printing from a\nrotating drum is possible. Gauss investigated when one surface can be\nmapped onto another in such a way that distances are not altered,\nshowing that a necessary condition for this to happen is that the\ncurvatures at corresponding points are the same. And this also implies\nthat the same figures can be constructed on all of these surfaces; the\nminimal lines or\u00a0curves of shortest length between two points\n(geodesics) on one surface correspond to those on the others, so that\nangles, areas, etc. will be the same. Gauss had found a deeper way to\nlook into the geometry of a surface, and this gave birth to modern\ndifferential geometry.\n\nIt was not immediately appreciated that Gauss\u2019s approach allowed\nmathematicians to define surfaces as regions of the plane with a\nparticular metric that are not to be obtained from surfaces in\nEuclidean 3-dimensional space. If one defines a surface as\nthe image of a map from a piece of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) to\n\\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), then of course it is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). But if one\ndefines a surface as a region of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) with a particular\nmetric, then there may be no surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) to which it\ncorresponds. The first person to appreciate this seems to have been\nRiemann, who also extended this idea to any number of dimensions.\n5.1 Riemann's generalisation\n\nRiemann\u2019s ideas were both profound and na\u00efve, and for that\nreason they proved difficult to make precise, but we can content\nourselves with being na\u00efve initially. He supposed he was given a\nspace (he called it a \u2018manifold\u2019) in which one can at any\npoint impose a coordinate system at least on all points near to an\narbitrary initial point, and if \\(n\\) numbers are needed to specify\nthe location of a point he said that the space is \\(n\\)-dimensional.\nWe can think of this process as providing a map of at least that part\nof the space near the initial point onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Riemann was\nvery aware of the difference between local and global determinations,\nand this became one of the keys to his new ideas: the same local\nconditions are compatible with numerous different global\nconfigurations.\n\nHe then supposed there was a means of saying what the distance was\ninfinitesimally, by generalising the formula for \\(ds\\) from 2 to\n\\(n\\) variables. (He even allowed that entirely different formulae be\nused, but we shall not describe that part of his theory, which lay\nfallow for many years). Next, he generalized the intrinsic property of\ncurvature to higher dimensions; essentially, the \\(n\\)-dimensional\nobject has lots of 2-dimensional surfaces to which the Gaussian theory\napplies, so a notion of curvature of a \\(n\\)-dimensional object at a\npoint can be derived from a consideration of the 2-dimensional\nsurfaces that pass through the point.\n\nThere are properties of the space that are independent of the\ncoordinate system. If two different coordinate systems give out\ndifferent coordinates, but in such a way that the distance between the\npoints is preserved, then either system gives us the same geometry,\nand we find that the two agree on the curvatures at each point, on\ndistances, and so forth. Yet the framework of differential geometry\nproposed by Riemann is very flexible and general. He found that it\nallowed not only for alternatives to Euclidean geometry, but even for\ngeometries where the generalized curvature does change from point to\npoint. Initially this was scarcely taken up, and most authors focused\non geometries of constant curvature. As Riemann explained, his\nframework allowed for geometries of negative curvature (this is the\nLobachevskii-Bolyai case), of positive curvature (a new kind, often\ncalled elliptic geometry, or \u2018Riemannian\u2019 in a narrow\nsense), and also of zero curvature (Euclidean).\n\nBecause the formula for \\(ds\\) was written down subject to only a\nfew restrictions, there is no reason to believe that a Riemannian\ngeometry is defined with respect to an antecedent Euclidean geometry.\nThere is no claim that an \\(n\\)-dimensional Riemannian geometry is to\nbe obtained by a map from an \\(n\\)-dimensional subset of some\nEuclidean \\(m\\)-dimensional space. This means that geometry\ncan be done without reference to any Euclidean geometry. Euclidean\ngeometry is no longer epistemologically prior to any study of other\ngeometries. The reign of Euclid\nwas\u2014theoretically\u2014over.\n\nGiven a concept of distance on a manifold it is possible to talk about\ngeodesics\u2014a geodesic being a curve of shortest length between\ntwo points. Existence and uniqueness questions can be raised, and\noften answered. A significant advance was made independently by Tullio\nLevi-Civita in 1917 and Hermann Weyl in 1918, inspired by\nEinstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, when they showed how to\ndefine parallelism on a curved manifold (on Levi-Civita\u2019s\ncontribution, see Bottazzini 1999 and on Weyl\u2019s contribution see\nScholz 2001). Roughly speaking, in Weyl\u2019s presentation (1918),\ntwo vectors at different points are parallel if they belong to a\nfamily of vectors along a curve that do not vary along the curve. This\nbecame referred to as a way of establishing a connection between\ndifferent points, and the theory was called the theory of connections\non manifolds. One can ask if a family of tangent vectors to a curve is\ncomposed of vectors parallel to the tangent vector at the starting\npoint: if so, the curve is a natural candidate to be considered the\nstraightest curve between its end points, because the tangent vector\nnever accelerates along the curve. In modern differential geometry,\ngeodesics are defined via connections.\n5.2 Riemann and Beltrami and rigorous non-Euclidean geometry\n\nRiemann\u2019s \u201c\u00dcber die Hypothesen \u2026\u201d\n(given as a lecture in 1854, published posthumously in 1868) and\nBeltrami\u2019s \u201cSaggio di interpretazione\u201d\n(1868) gave different but equivalent accounts of 2-dimensional\nnon-Euclidean geometry. Beltrami employed differential geometry to\njustify the hyperbolic geometry of Lobachevskii-Bolyai. By studying\nthe pseudosphere and how it can be mapped onto the plane (in such a\nway that its geodesics went to straight lines), Beltrami realized that\nthe unit disk can be viewed as an \u2018infinite plane\u2019. It had\nbeen impossible to find a surface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) that behaved\nlike the hyperbolic plane (the closest, but partial, being the\npseudosphere); now it was possible to realize non-Euclidean geometry\nas the geometry of the interior of a disk with a novel metric. The\ndisk is the whole \u2018plane\u2019, its circumference a line at\ninfinity, line segments in the disk are \u2018lines\u2019, and one\ncan define a distance function\n\\(d(P,Q)\\) that makes sense and validates Lobachevskii\u2019s\nresults. From the logical point of view, this was an enormous step\nforward, as the consistency of non-Euclidean geometry was now\nproven.\n\nRiemann\u2019s account, which was stated in \\(n\\) dimensions, agrees\nwith the one that Poincar\u00e9 was to use in many short\npublications in 1880 and 1881 but only describe explicitly in his\nmajor paper (Poincar\u00e9 1882). In this so-called\nconformal model, the plane is again a disk, geodesics are\narcs of circles perpendicular to the boundary of the disk and angles\nare true (Euclidean). The Riemann and Beltrami disks swiftly persuaded\nmathematicians that the non-Euclidean geometry of Bolyai and\nLobachevskii did, after all, make rigorous mathematical sense.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s contribution a decade later was to make\nnon-Euclidean geometry the natural geometry for certain topics\nelsewhere in mathematics, chiefly the developing and important subject\nof Riemann surfaces.\n\nThe importance of a rigorous account of any part of mathematics should\nnot be ignored, but the acceptance of non-Euclidean and Riemannian\ngeometries went beyond the presentation of a consistent formalism. It\nmarks the acceptance of the abstract view that geometry is whatever\ncan be described in the Riemannian formalism: one has a very general\nframework, allowing for a dizzying number of concrete specifications.\nThus the door was opened to the view that there are many geometries,\neach of which must be consistent, and none of which need to refer to\nEuclidean space, however intuitive this may be. (A parallel\ndevelopment with similar outcome happened in the context of projective\ngeometry with Klein's work.) The number of dimensions of the\n\u2018space\u2019 under discussion, and the precise metric can be\nmodified at will (in due course, the topological character of that\n\u2018space\u2019 would be treated similarly). There is a\n2-dimensional geometry of such-and-such a kind because a suitable\nmetric can be found; because there is, as it were, a map of it, not\nbecause a surface has been found in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) with the right\nproperties. Indeed, it was later shown (Hilbert 1901) that there is no\nsurface in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) corresponding precisely to non-Euclidean\n2-dimensional space.\n\nRiemann was clear that the epistemological implications of this way of\ndoing geometry were immense. His lecture was a happy combination of\nmathematics, philosophy and physics (Ferreir\u00f3s 2006). Mathematicians\nshould no longer need to abstract some fundamental intuitions from\nwhat they believe about physical space, such as the nature and\nproperties of straight lines or circles, and seek to build a true\ngeometry on the basis of some axiomatic expression of those\nintuitions. Rather, the direction of thought should go in the opposite\ndirection: mathematicians were free to consider infinitely many\ngeometries. Riemann speculated about the validity of the hypotheses of\ngeometry \"in the infinitely small\" being possibly bound up with the\nphysical forces. Scientists could now freely investigate which\ngeometry is best for the mathematical explanation of empirical facts.\nHe envisioned the abandonment of the Newtonian conception of\nphenomena, \"by making in this conception the successive changes\nrequired by facts which it cannot explain.\" His purely conceptual\n(mathematical) research would be useful \"in preventing this work from\nbeing hampered by too narrow views, and progress in knowledge of the\ninterdependence of things from being checked by traditional\nprejudices.\" In this connection, it was soon shown that it is possible\nto do theoretical mechanics in the setting of non-Euclidean\ngeometry.\n6. The intelligibility of the new geometries\n\nThe epistemological significance of projective geometry rests on its\nimplications for the nature and rigour of classical geometry. The\nepistemological significance of non-Euclidean geometry rests more on\nthe possibility that it could be true in whatever way that Euclidean\ngeometry could be true. We therefore turn to 19th century\nexaminations of the intelligibility of geometry.\n\nBut first a word of warning. The logical fact that non-Euclidean\ngeometry turned out to be consistent (relative to Euclidean geometry,\nor to real analysis) does not per se establish the invalidity of the\nKantian viewpoint. Kant's views are compatible with the existence of\nlogical alternatives to Euclidean geometry; after all, he was arguing\nabout space as an intuition, not about mere conceptual possibilities;\nhe was not a Leibnizian, and denied that geometry is analytic. If\nanything, a Kantian would expect that the alternative geometries are\nonly an intellectual possibility, and that we cannot visualize them\nintuitively. A sophisticated elaboration of such a standpoint was\nFrege's in his famous correspondence with Hilbert (see the entry on the\n Frege-Hilbert controversy).\n But it's true that most of the relevant authors chose a different\nline of thought and abandoned the Kantian position.\n6.1 Herbart\u2019s philosophy and Riemann\n\nJohann Friedrich Herbart became Kant\u2019s successor in\nK\u00f6nigsberg in 1808, where he remained until going to\nG\u00f6ttingen in 1833, but he was no orthodox Kantian. His major\nwork, the two-volume Psychologie als Wissenschaft neu gegrundet\nauf Erfahrung, Metaphysik, und Mathematik of 1824\u20131825,\nsought to establish psychology as a science, based on experience and\nmetaphysics. Using some rather fanciful mathematics he endeavoured to\nshow how memory works and how repeated stimuli of certain kinds cause\nthe mind to learn to perceive, for example, lines, parallel lines,\nintersecting lines, and surfaces. There are no innate ideas, in\nHerbart\u2019s opinion; visual space is constructed from experience,\nmost significantly by means of the conceptual act of inferring\ncontinuity in spatial processes. And concepts are generated by\nclusters of memories, upon which logic then operates independently of\ntheir origins. This was Herbart\u2019s way of avoiding grounding\nlogic in psychology.\n\nHerbart\u2019s ideas influenced Riemann (see Scholz 1982). Riemann\nregarded natural science as the attempt to understand nature by the\nuse of precise concepts, which are to be modified in the light of new\nexperiences. He expected the most successful concepts to be quite\nabstract, and agreed with Herbart that they are not a priori in the\nKantian fashion. It was their origin in observation or experiment that\ngave these concepts their significance for science, but Riemann\nallowed for a constant process of corroboration and revision. In notes\nhe wrote for himself (see Riemann Werke 1990: 539) Riemann\nsaid that he agreed with Herbart in matters of psychology and\nepistemology, but not ontology or with his ideas about the\nconstruction of the concepts of space, time, and motion. The\ndisagreement masks a deeper sympathy. Herbart had advocated a\nthree-dimensional real world of causally connected but discrete\n'monads' (with windows, to use Leibniz's phrase), which the mind\ntreats via the concept of a continuum, which it supplies, thereby\nturning its discrete experiences into spectra of possibilities.\nRiemann saw no reason to restrict attention to three dimensions, and\nmoved the continuous spectra of possibilities into the very general\ngeometrical concepts he was creating.\n\nThis diminished the role of experience that Herbart had emphasised.\nRiemann was making conscious what Herbart had said occurred naturally:\nif intellectual reflection generates concepts with which we frame the\nworld, in reaction to our experiences, then, said Riemann, let\nmathematics generate more precise and flexible concepts with which to\nconduct science. At the end of his lecture he explored possibilities\nfor the application of the new geometries, especially at an atomic\nlevel, and he argued that his task had been to expand the range of\ntheoretical options, eliminating prejudices.\n6.2 Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9\n\nRiemann\u2019s ideas in turn influenced Hermann von Helmholtz, who\npublished several influential essays on how our knowledge of geometry\nis possible. In his \u201cOn the factual [thats\u00e4chlichen]\nfoundations of geometry\u201d (1866) he endeavoured to show how\nonly a limited number of Riemannian geometries can be constructed in\nwhich there is a concept of rigid body motion. He argued that it is\nour experience of rigid bodies that teaches us what space is like, and\nin particular what distance is. He further claimed that a\n2-dimensional space that admits rigid body motions would either be the\nEuclidean plane or the sphere. Beltrami wrote to him to point out that\nhe had overlooked the possibility of non-Euclidean geometry, and\nHelmholtz not only agreed, but wrote a further essay (1868) in which\nhe explained how it would be possible for us to have knowledge of this\ngeometry at an intuitive level (thus giving the lie to followers of\nKant). Many Kantians refused to be convinced, but one person that\nthese ideas (and Riemann's) very likely influenced was Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 (see Gray 2012).\n\nAs soon as Poincar\u00e9 began to write his popular philosophical\nessays about geometry, he made it clear that his chief concern was\nwith how we could rely on any geometry at all. Mathematical advances\nwere the basis for his reflections, but the key question was about the\nepistemological status of the hypotheses on which geometry is founded.\nAnd here he could not agree with Kant, nor Helmholtz, nor with\nRiemann. He was well aware of the great range of Riemannian\ngeometries, and of the conclusion of Helmholtz\u2019s speculations,\nby then made rigorous in the work of Sophus Lie, that a very limited\nnumber of geometries admitted rigid body motions. His concern in his\n\u201cOn the foundations of geometry\u201d (1898) was with\nepistemology.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argued that the mind quickly realises that it can\ncompensate for certain kinds of motions that it sees. If a glass comes\ntowards you, you can walk backwards in such a way that the glass seems\nunaltered. You can do the same if it tilts or rotates. We come to\nmaster a store of these compensating motions, and we realise that we\ncan follow one with another and the result will be a third\ncompensating motion. On this basis we come to distinguish\ndisplacements (both our bodily displacements and displacements of\nobjects) from other kinds of change, i.e., alterations for which we\ncannot generate compensating motions, such as the motion of the wine\nin the glass as it swirls around, or a change in its colour. Most\nimportantly, the displacements form a mathematical structure called a\ngroup. In this way the mind comes to form the concept of a rigid body\nmotion, and we elaborate a clear conceptual understanding of space on\nthe basis of the group of motions.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 then considered what group the group of compensating\nmotions could be, and found that, as Lie had proved in his study of\nthe Riemann-Helmholtz problem of space, there was a strictly limited\ncollection of such groups. Chief among them were the groups that come\nfrom Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and as abstract groups they\nare different. But which one was correct?\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s controversial view was that one could never\nknow, or better, than none was simply \"true\". Human beings, through\nevolution and through our experience as infants, pick the Euclidean\ngroup and so we say that space is Euclidean. Our bodies are quite\nrigid, our motions are rigid motions, and this is decisive. Another\nspecies, drawing on different experiences, could pick the\nnon-Euclidean group and so say that space was non-Euclidean. If we met\nsuch a species, there would be no experiment that would decide the\nissue.\n\nOf course, one can make experiments using large triangles and\nmeasuring the angles, as Lobachevskii, Riemann and others had\nsuggested. To maximize dimensions, assume that the sides of the\ntriangle are made by rays of light. Now, suppose that within the\nlimits of experimental error the result of the experiment is that the\nangle sum of the triangle is less that \\(\\pi\\), a result consistent\nwith non-Euclidean geometry but inconsistent with Euclidean geometry.\nThe only conclusion one can draw, said Poincar\u00e9, is that either\nlight rays travel along straight lines and space is non-Euclidean, or\nthat space is Euclidean and light rays travel along curves.\n\nWe can summarise his argument this way. Our knowledge of the geometry\nof the external world is founded on our basic physical experiences,\nwhich lead to our mental ability to deal with a group of rigid body\nmotions. There is a very limited store of these groups, but no\nexperiment can decide between them. All we can do is make a choice,\nand we shall choose the simplest one. As it happens, that was the\nEuclidean group, because, said Poincar\u00e9, we had found that one\nof its properties not shared with the non-Euclidean group\n(corresponding to the parallel postulate), was particularly simple.\nBut the human species had, as it were, made a choice, and that choice\nwas now innate in the human mind. Because of the way knowledge is\nacquired and the fact that there is more than one appropriate group,\none can never know whether space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean, only\nthat we construct it as Euclidean.\n\nThis twist on the Kantian doctrine of the unknowability of the\nDing an sich (the thing in itself) and our confinement to the\nworld of appearances, was congenial to Poincar\u00e9 as a working\nphysicist. Even though he agreed with Riemann to a large extent,\nRiemann had hoped that empirical matters would guide the choice of\ngeometry, while Poincar\u00e9 could not agree. The viewpoint just\nexplained is Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophy of geometrical\nconventionalism. But there is an important distinction to make. Notice\nthat this is not like the conventionality of words, but rather like\nsocial or legal conventions (where some basic facts have to be taken\ninto account, see De Paz 2018). The situation is far from total\narbitrariness, since physical experience plays a decisive role and\nrestricts the choice; but there is no absolute determination either,\nin the end a choice has to be made, and simplicity has the final\nword.\n\nHe advocated conventionalism in other areas of science too, arguing\nthat what we call the laws of nature (Newton\u2019s laws, e.g., the\nprinciple of inertia) are neither empirical matters open to revision\nnor absolute truths but are well established results that have been\nelevated to the role of axioms in present scientific theories. They\ncould be challenged, but only if a whole scientific theory was being\nchallenged, not idly when some awkward observations were made. Faced\nwith a satellite that did not seem to be obeying Newton\u2019s laws\none should, said Poincar\u00e9, consider some as-yet unnoticed force\nat work and not seek to re-write Newton. But a new theory can be\nproposed, based on different assumptions that rewrite a law of nature,\nbecause these laws are not eternal truths\u2014we could never know\nsuch things. And if a new law were to be proposed, simplicity and not\nonly empirical fit will be taken into account as one chooses between\nthe new and the old.\n\nThe crucial distinction here is that scientific conventionalism\noperates at a high level. The choices are made consciously and\nintellectually, the debate is only open to people with a considerable\namount of specialised education. On the other hand, the choice of\nEuclidean geometry operates in the mind before it is capable of any\nkind of formal instruction; without some geometric framework,\nthe unfortunate subject would be incapable of any knowledge of the\nexternal world.\n6.3 Poincar\u00e9 versus Russell\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views brought him into collision with Bertrand\nRussell in the 1890s when he was emerging from his brief Hegelian\nphase and entering his Kantian phase. Russell was trying to establish\nthe Kantian a priori by arguing that there is one fundamental\ngeometry, which is projective geometry, and we have synthetic a priori\nknowledge of it (see Griffin 1991 on Russell and Nabonnand 2000 on the\ncontroversy).\n\nThere can be little doubt that Poincar\u00e9, with his much greater\ncommand of mathematics, won much of the debate, as Russell, with his\ncharacteristic willingness to admit his errors, was willing to\nconcede. But a significant difference of approach between them was\nnever to be resolved. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s analysis began with\nrigid bodies and their motions, from which a concept of distance is\ncreated. Russell argued on the contrary, that whatever we may discover\nthe concept of distance to be, we know before we begin that the\ndistance from London to Paris is more than a metre. This\nPoincar\u00e9 denied in his \u201cDes fondements de la\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie: \u00e0 propos d\u2019un livre de M.\nRussell\u201d (1899).\n\nIn Poincar\u00e9\u2019s view, we only know the distance from\none point to another on the basis of experience with rigid bodies, and\nthis knowledge has become innate in us. In Russell\u2019s view,\ndistance is to be regarded as a fundamental intuition, and if some\ncontemplated that the distance from London to Paris could be less than\na metre, we would know we could not be talking about distance. But\nPoincar\u00e9 insisted that talk of what we know should always be\ndependent on how we know it; without that, the claims were not\nknowledge claims at all.\n\nA mathematical illustration may illuminate the disagreement. For\nPoincar\u00e9, talk about what we might call ordinary geometry, the\nsense of space that we have prior to advanced instruction, is really\nabout the ability we have to measure things. We can carry a rigid body\naround, and use it as a ruler. It is because we can do that that we\ncan speak of the distance between places. If you want to make the\nset-up more abstract, there must be a space and a group that acts on\nthe space and moves points in the space around. If this group has the\nproperty that however a region of that space is moved around it is\nnever mapped onto a proper subset of itself then one can construct\nrigid bodies and talk about distance.\n\nFor Russell, one is free to take a space and assign a\n\u2018distance\u2019 to each pair of points (subject to some simple\nconditions which we omit). Relative to this sense of distance, one can\nsay if, as a region is moved around, points in it remain the same\ndistance apart or not. We have done this for our sense of distance on\nthe surface of the Earth, and we can do this whether or not we also\nhave some rigid body motions. In mathematical terms, Russell would be\nhappy with what is called a metric space. The point is not that one\ncould impose a metric on the surface of the Earth in which a\nparticular pair of points, say in Cambridge, were a metre apart and\nLondon and Paris were only half a metre apart\u2014one\ncould\u2014but that one can talk about distance without presupposing\nthe action of a group. Some metric spaces admit the action of groups\nthat preserve distance, others do not, but distance can be defined\nwithout talking about a group. Poincar\u00e9 was never confronted\nwith exactly this argument\u2014metric spaces are an invention of the\n20th century\u2014but we know what he would have said. He\nwould have said that it was valid mathematics but entirely formal and\ncould not be considered as genuine knowledge because it lacked a\npsychophysical dimension. We know this because it was his criticism of\nthe axiomatic geometries constructed by Hilbert (see below).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s arguments also met with objections from the\nItalian mathematician Federigo Enriques. Poincar\u00e9 had argued\nthat one way to see the validity of the geometrical conventionalist\nargument was to consider a disc in which everything was made of the\nsame material, which expanded as it heated, and in which the\ntemperature was a particular function of the distance of the centre of\nthe disc. This function, which Poincar\u00e9 specified, ensured that\nthe metric in the disc, as measured by rods made of the same material\nas the disc, was that of non-Euclidean geometry. Creatures living in\nthe disc would report that their space was non-Euclidean; we would\nreply that their space was Euclidean but subject to the distorting\neffect of a temperature field. Plainly each side can maintain their\nposition free of self-contradiction.\n\nEnriques argued, in his book Problemi della Scienza (1906),\nthat this was unreasonable. The creatures would be right to ascribe a\ngeometry to their space (and, indeed, non-Euclidean geometry) because\nthe distorting force is beyond their control. Their geodesics are\nbuilt in to the space, and it would be unreasonable of them to ascribe\nthe paths of geodesics to the operation of a \u2018force\u2019\nbecause that \u2018force\u2019 was not something they could even in\nprinciple manipulate. Heat, the gravitational effect of massive\nobjects, all these distorting influences are things that can be\nallowed for, because they can be changed. If, in the experiment above,\nit were to be claimed that space is Euclidean but our candidates for\nstraight lines are deformed it should be possible to vary the degree\nof deformation. One might conduct the experiment further away from any\nmassive objects, in emptier regions of space. If different experiments\ngave even slightly different results one would, in accordance with\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s own criteria for changing scientific\nconventions, look for something in the circumstances that was\nresponsible for the deviation of the light rays from straightness. But\nif no experiment were to show any difference, Enriques argued that it\nwould be rational to conclude that light rays travelled on geodesics\nand the geometry of space was non-Euclidean.\n\nIt is worth noticing that the growing sophistication of ideas about\nhow theoretical geometry relates to practical experience, and about\nthe nature of the knowledge that geometry supplies, belong to a family\nof changes across all of mathematics by 1900. An autonomous discipline\nof mathematics emerged that placed an increasing emphasis on formal\naspects of the subject and offered a complicated and often distant\nrelationship with the world of experience. This modernist turn in\nmathematics is discussed in various places (see Gray 2008 and the\nliterature cited there).\n7. Concluding remarks\n\nThis essay has examined the main branches in the development of\ngeometry until the early years of the 20th century under\nthe headings of theoretical or abstract knowledge, empirical and other\nanalyses of the intelligibility of such knowledge, and the deductive\ncharacter of that knowledge.\n\nThe status of the straight line in elementary Euclidean geometry as\nboth the shortest curve joining any two of its points and as the curve\nthat points always in the same direction was disentangled. One line of\nenquiry led to geometries that emphasised straightness as the\nfundamental property (typically, projective geometry) and the other to\ngeometries that emphasised the shortest aspect. The former approach\nwas seen from the start as a non-metrical one, and became the favoured\narena for formal, even axiomatic investigations of geometry as a\ndeductive enterprise. The price was having less and less to say about\nphysical space (as Poincar\u00e9 observed). The concept of geometry\nwas radically enlarged, but in ways that were not intended to be\naccounts of physical space or experiential space.\n\nThe metrical account led to a progressive elucidation of a significant\nobscurity in Euclid\u2019s Elements: the parallel postulate.\nFor much of the 19th century, non-Euclidean geometries\n(like Lobachevskii's) were the only alternative to Euclid\u2019s that\nwas proposed as an intelligible geometry, even though it was generally\nagreed that only the most delicate experiments could hope to decide\nthe matter. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s contested view was that no\nexperiment could so decide, and this raised important issues about the\nway abstract terms are to be interpreted and the role of hypotheses in\nscientific theory.\n\nBeyond the eye-catching and thought-provoking idea of a physical\ngeometry alternative to Euclid\u2019s system, which had stood for two\nthousand years, there was the panoply of metrical geometries hinted at\nin work on differential geometry by Gauss and above all by Riemann.\nHere it finally proved possible to explain the relationship between\nstraightest and shortest in a suitably general setting. It also became\npossible to discuss geometry as a body of ideas that grew out of naive\nideas of length, angle, shape, and size, and to do so in a\nsophisticated and rigorous way. What had been regarded as inescapable\naxiomatic truths, necessary truths, now became hypothetical\nassumptions that could be modified in many ways; the old notion of an\naxiom yielded gradually to the modern one. It was also possible to\ncontemplate all kinds of theoretical structures as\n\u2018spaces\u2019, whether or not they were presented axiomatically\nor intended as distillations of intelligible experience. In this way,\nit became possible to apply geometrical ideas in novel settings and in\nnovel ways. Geometrisation has been ubiquitous in maths and science\never since.\n\nAfter 1900, it was clear that Euclidean geometry had lost its\npre-eminent position. This ancient system lost its certainty, and\nthere were better formal, axiomatic systems, such as those proposed by\nHilbert and some mathematicians in the school around Peano. There\nwere rich systems that were more fundamental, in the sense of using\nfewer properties of the figures of traditional geometry such as the\nstraight line (the many versions of projective geometry). And there\nwas a profusion of metrical geometries with more natural starting\npoints and deeper theories.\n\nAs a result, ideas about how theoretical geometry of whatever kind\nrelates to the space around us had become much more sophisticated.\nFrom the standpoint of pure mathematics, the situation was one of\npluralism. The truth of geometry was no longer to be taken for\ngranted, notoriously the Kantian viewpoint was generally abandoned.\nChoosing a physical geometry had become, in some measure, an empirical\nquestion \u2014if we assume Poincar\u00e9 was not right. Philosophical\nideas about the intelligibility of geometry had also deepened. Perhaps\nalso from the standpoint of general science one ought to consider a\npluralistic outlook.\n",
