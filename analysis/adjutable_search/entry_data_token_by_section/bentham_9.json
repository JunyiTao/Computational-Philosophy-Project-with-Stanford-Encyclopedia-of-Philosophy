    "main_text": "Later Improvements || Universal Interest\n4.3 Universal Interest\n\nAs an additional improvement in the manner in which Bentham conceived\nthe utility principle, he might have included the \u201cuniversal\ninterest\u201d, an idea initially stated in Plan of Parliamentary\nReform where it appears as a more particular conception of the\ngreatest happiness principle aimed at the \u201cmaximum\n\u2026 of comfort and security\u201d for all (1838\u201343, III,\n452). The universal interest relates to interests that are shared by\neveryone, and only when it is impossible for government to contrive\npolicies to achieve this end is a distribution of happiness less than\nuniversal or less than equal justified (1983b, 136). However, the\nnumber of decisions made by governments that are genuinely of\nuniversal reach are relatively few and may be limited to national\ndefence and the framework of individual rights (securities). Beyond\nthat, redistributive policies invariably involve unequal sacrifices\nand benefits. This means that the legislator must employ a utilitarian\ncalculation in which the pain experienced by the few is reduced to the\nminimum necessary to produce benefits for the many; only on this basis\nmay pleasures be summed and pains subtracted in order to produce the\nrationale to justify the best policy.\n\nRelated to this conception of the universal interest is the\negalitarian commitment that in arriving at the appropriate law or\npolicy the interests of each and all must count, and count equally\n(1840 [1864], I, 144). This does not mean that optimal utility is not\nthe goal, but simply stresses that optimal utility is more likely\nachieved where there is an approximate equality in the distribution of\nthe basic requirements of happiness (Postema 1998). \n\nThis aspect of Bentham\u2019s theory has often been ignored or\ndismissed as irrelevant by critics who, from T. H. Green forward,\nargue that calculations of total utility fail to respect the\ndistinctiveness of persons and thereby place their interests at\nperpetual risk (Rawls 1971, 22\u201327; Nozick 1974, 28\u201335; see\nthe discussions in Ten 1987, 13\u201337; Rosen 2003, Chs.\n12\u201313; and Bykvist 2010, Ch. 5). If deterrence can be achieved\nby punishing an innocent bystander when the real culprit cannot be\ncaught or brought to justice, then why should the bystander not be\npunished? Because public utility would be maximised by making an\nexample of an innocent bystander just as much as by punishing the\nperson who was actually guilty of the offence but who has not been\napprehended, it seems the utilitarian ought to support the punishment.\nBut this is not only intuitively wrong, it is also wrong because there\nis a real danger that violations of security would lead to other such\nviolations, with no principled basis to cease inflicting them. Bentham\nwas emphatic on this score: \u201cIf it is a good thing to sacrifice\nthe fortune of one individual to augment that of others, it will be\nyet better to sacrifice a second, a third, a hundred, a thousand,\n\u2026; for whatever may be the number of those you have sacrificed,\nyou will always have the same reason to add one more. In one word, the\ninterest of everybody is sacred, or the interest of nobody\u201d\n(1840 [1864], I, 144). Basic securities must be afforded to each and\nevery member of the community, and violations of these vital interests\nare not justified, whether they be perpetrated by other individuals or\ngovernment, since they contravene the distributive elements of\nutilitarian theory. To this extent, at the very least, each\nperson\u2019s happiness must count.\n",
