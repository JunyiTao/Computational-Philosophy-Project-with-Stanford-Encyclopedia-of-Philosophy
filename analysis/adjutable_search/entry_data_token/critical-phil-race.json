Introduction\n\nModern European philosophers played a key role in the development of\nthe concept of race as a way to characterize, and rank, differences\namong human groups (Bernasconi 2018; Valls 2005; Ward and Lott 2002;\nBernasconi and Lott 2000). Philosophers in the modern era (roughly from\n1600 to 1900) often disagreed on the nature of race, the source of\nracial differences, and the correlations between race and non-physical\ncharacteristics. Kant, Rousseau and Mill, for example, disagreed over\nthe critical issue of whether racial differences were mutable (Kant\n2012; Elden and Mendieta 2011; Boxill 2005). Defining race in terms of\nunderlying biological features emerged well after the language of race\nhad become familiar. The biology of race continues to elicit\ncontroversy over whether it has explanatory value (Kitcher 2007;\nSpencer 2015, \n; Glasgow et al. 2019).\n\nThe Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) developed in large part as a\ncritique of modern ideas and approaches to both race and proffered\nsolutions to racism. In this, CPR was influenced by the late 20th\ncentury developments of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) and Critical Race\nTheory (CRT) (Unger 2015; Delgado 1995; Delgado and Stefancic 1997;\nEssed and Goldberg 2002). CLS and CRT were motivated to go beyond\nquestions of formal equality and de jure discrimination to\nconsider the subtle and broad reach of racist ideas and practices\nthroughout social life and institutions, arguing, for example, that\nnorms of neutrality in legal interpretation or reasoning often\nconcealed structural racism.\n\nWhile borrowing from CLS and CRT, CPR\u2019s distinctive\nphilosophical interests concern the role racialization plays in\nembodiment, subjectivity, identity formation as well as formations of\npower and the establishment of meaning. In order to reach beyond\nEurocentric philosophical resources CPR has drawn from anti-colonial\nwritings as well as critical work in sociology, history, psychology and\nother fields that have addressed the topic of race and racism more\nthoroughly than philosophy (e.g. Mallon and Kelly 2012; Steele 2011;\nFeagin 2013; Horne 2020).\n1.1 Critical Legal Studies\n\nThe influential field of Critical Legal Studies, or CLS, that\nemerged in the 1970s played an important role in developing new\napproaches to the study of how the law affects and is affected by\nsocial domination. Influenced by some strands in continental\nphilosophy, CLS scholars showed how legal arguments and concepts could\ncovertly support existing power relations (Douzinas 2000). Early CLS\nscholars such as Duncan Kennedy (2008) and Roberto Magabeira Unger\n(2015) argued that the pattern of social effects produced by legal\ndecisions indicates that the law is not an impartial arbiter but\nlargely an arm of existing hierarchies.\n\nTo see this required new methods of legal analysis that could\ndiscern patterns of implicit assumptions operating across the major\nparadigms of legal reasoning, whether intentionalist, textualist, or\noriginalist. One such assumption is the centrality and legitimacy of\nstare decisis or judicial precedent. CLS argued for setting\nprecedent aside in order to judge decisions in relation to their often\ndisparate impact on different groups. They argued that these\ndifferential impacts were often the result of unexamined assumptions\nstructuring legal argumentation, such as the assumption that\nresponsibility must track conscious intent, or that male power over\nwomen is natural, or that equality claims must be based on\nsameness.\n\nCLS scholars argued that conventions of legal analysis promulgated\nmystifying ideologies that obscured the law\u2019s social embeddedness\nand political function. They argued that we need to take a new look at\nthe concepts of liberalism such as rights, neutrality, and freedom to\nsee whether these concepts were as universally applicable as some\nclaimed. Laws and policies based on liberal ideas, such as meritocracy,\nexacerbated class and racial inequality and injustice. Liberal\napproaches led to these outcomes because they downplayed differences of\nhistory and embodiment and assumed the fungibility of roles such as\ncitizen or rights-holder (Mills 2017).\n\nThe emergence of classical liberalism coincided with the development\nof brutal forms of capitalism, a decrease in women\u2019s property\nrights, and race-based slavery, colonization, and genocide. Was\nliberalism simply negligent, or did its central concepts play a role in\nsanctioning social oppression? Progressives like John Stuart Mill tied\nthe right of self-determination to cultural advance, thus justifying\ncolonial administrations. John Locke\u2019s labor theory of value\nhelped to legitimate the expropriation of indigenous lands on the\ngrounds that many groups relied more on hunting than labor-intensive\nagriculture. Reading the central arguments of liberalism in light of\ntheir diverse impact on different groups raised new questions about\nliberalism\u2019s relationship to domination.\n\nThe work of legal theorist Derrick Bell was key in bringing a CLS\napproach to the topic of race. Bell developed a series of interpretive\narguments focused on the reforms won by civil rights cases to show that\nthe successes were generally contained to those that did not threaten\nwhite entitlement (Bell 1987). Corporate elites used the mandate for\ndiversity, for example, as a means to create a diverse managerial class\nmore effective at controlling the broad multi-racial low-paid\nworkforce. When establishing racism required evidence of intentional\nattitudes or conscious conspiracies, it was all but impossible to\nredress cross generational wealth disparities based on race or the\nstructural forms of anti-black racism so deeply embedded in such\ninstitutions as education, the justice system, health care, housing,\nand the local, state and national organizations intended to serve\ndemocratic representation. Thus, civil rights reforms left racism\n\u201cfirmly entrenched,\u201d as Bell put it (1987, 4). Forced to\nwork with liberal concepts, progressive civil rights legislation ended\nup providing cover for the continuation of racial divides in housing,\nwage scales, and education while the criminal justice system has become\neven more lethal to Black and Brown populations.\n1.2 Critical Race Theory\n\nCPR also draws from Critical Race Theory, or CRT. Like CLS, CRT\nscholars have been concerned to critique liberalism as the hegemonic\nideology of the West, but they pursue a more interdisciplinary\napproach. CRT scholars argued that solutions that stay within the\nbounds of liberalism are insufficient because \u201cracialized\npower\u201d is embedded \u201cin practices and values which have been\nshorn of any explicit, formal manifestations of racism\u201d (Delgado\n1995, xxix). Moreover, liberals often argue that any form of \u201crace\nconsciousness\u201d is racist, with the result that anti-racist\nreforms, such as affirmative action or housing subsidies, must prove\nallegiance to the doctrines of abstract individualism and present\nrace-conscious reforms as temporary deviations from the normative\nideals of neutrality. Liberal ideals that imagine individuals\nabstractly outside of their historical and social context thwart\nefforts to address the effects of historical legacies on current social\nrelations, property distributions, group welfare and security, and the\ndetermination of merit.\n\nIn an influential article, CRT scholar Richard Delgado shows that\nthe academic scholarship that pursues anti-racist ends is hobbled by an\nincapacity in effective self-reflection. In 1984 Delgado set out to\nfind the top twenty law review articles on civil rights\u2014those\nmost often cited, those published in the most well-established\njournals\u2014and found that all were written by white men. There was an\n\u201celaborate minuet\u201d of exclusively internal engagement\nwithin this grouping over the best means to move forward on racial\njustice (1995, 47). Their arguments were strong, but how could it be,\nDelgado wondered, that even an idea such as having a \u201cwithered\nself-concept\u201d would be best represented in the work of white\nauthors citing other white authors rather than the important work by\npeople of color on the phenomenal effect of racist societies? When he\nasked the author of one article on this topic why theorists such as W.\nE. B. Du Bois, Kenneth Clark, Frantz Fanon or others were not cited,\nthe author explained that he preferred the source he cited because it\nwas \u201cso elegant.\u201d Criticism directed at the origin of\nintellectual work continues to be considered a suspect species of ad\nhominem argument, making concerns about the politics of citation appear\nillegitimate. Yet can white writing achieve sufficiency in a matter\nsuch as self-esteem that involves first person experience? The problem\nhere, from Delgado\u2019s perspective, was that ruling out\nconsiderations of social identity in the development of intellectual\nwork diminished the quality of that intellectual work, but in a way\nthat liberal premises could never reveal.\n\nConnected to this has been the ongoing problem of the\nconceptualization of \u201cmerit.\u201d If normal hiring or\npublications decisions are viewed as generic, without considerations of\nthe social identity of the candidate, then preferential hiring is a\ndeviation from the norm and must meet a high bar to establish even\ntemporary legitimacy. But both CLS and CRT have endeavored to show that\nmerit-based decisions often promulgate implicit racism. Judging which\nare the top articles by the number of their citations may look to be a\nneutral standard, but it in fact perpetuates injustice while concealing\nthat injustice.\n1.3 Philosophical Influences on CPR\n\nCritical Philosophy of Race, then, has followed in this critical\ntradition of considering the varied and subtle forms in which race\noperates in the development, debate, and assessment of philosophical\nideas and arguments. Although many make use of Anglo-American and\nanalytic philosophical approaches, what distinguishes the work in CPR\nfrom the general work in philosophy of race is its use of figures and\ntraditions of philosophy in what is sometimes called the\n\u201ccontinental\u201d sphere. For example, as will be discussed\nbelow, David Theo Goldberg (1993) and Cornel West (1982) have both made\nproductive and creative use of Michel Foucault\u2019s analysis of\npower and power/knowledge; Lewis Gordon (1995a; 1995b, 2000) and George\nYancy (2008) developed new phenomenological approaches to the study of\nracism by drawing from and building upon the work of Jean-Paul Sartre\nand Frantz Fanon; and others have found resources in Jacques Derrida,\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir, Friedrich Nietzsche, Herbert\nMarcuse, Jurgen Habermas, Martin Heidegger, and Sigmund Freud. To be\nsure, each of these European continental philosophers exhibited some of\nthe same patterns of racial ignorance rife in the general canon of\nWestern philosophy and have come under critical debate themselves\nwithin CPR. Yet the continental tradition paid productive attention to\nembodiment, socially variable rather than universal modes of\nperception, the link between power and concept formation, and thus\ncontributed new ways to think about the covert background structures\nthat affect democracy.\n\nContinental philosophy has also begun to critique its own\nartificially narrow canon and to include more prominently the writings\nof Frantz Fanon, Edouard Glissant, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edward Said, Kwame\nNkrumah, Gayatri Spivak, and others who were more centrally concerned\nwith, and acutely perceptive about, issues of race.\n\nIn a recent innovative move to approach the history of philosophy\ndifferently, some CPR scholars are \u201ccreolizing\u201d canonical\nfigures to foreground their reception in the colonized world (Gordon\nand Roberts 2015; Monahan 2017). Rousseau for example had a major\ninfluence on Caribbean thought, and reading Rousseau through Fanon,\nC.L.R. James, and others has produced new interpretive insights as well\nas new critical dialogues. These \u201cillicit blendings\u201d can\nbring questions of slavery, colonialism and race into the forefront of\ndiscussions that continue to engage the European modern tradition but\nin new ways (Bernab\u00e9 et al. 1990). By expanding the sphere of\ninterlocutors in debates over freedom or human dignity, we can also\ncome to engage a wider plurality of philosophical concepts and, in\neffect, creolize the canon. \n\nTo suggest that CPR has a singular methodology would be a mistake:\ndiscourse analysis, psychoanalysis, and phenomenology have conducted a\nfamous war against one another, and do not share a methodology. And yet\nwhat one finds on this side of the ledger of philosophical discussions\nof race are a notable body of differences in the topics of analysis;\nfor example, unlike in analytic philosophy of race, there is little\nattention to the question of whether the category of race is\nscientifically viable, whether we should eliminate the racial terms,\nand perhaps regrettably, there is little attention to the debates over\nconcrete policies to redress racism, such as affirmative action or\nreparations.\n\nIn general, Critical Philosophers of Race focus on how race operates\nin societies, the effects of race at both the structural and\nphenomenological levels, and the ways in which some forms of resistance\nto racial systems can be recuperated into sustaining the status quo.\nRace as a category is subject not so much to biological debate as\ngenealogical analysis, which makes it possible to see how, as Falguni\nSheth argues, the central issue is not the fact of the division of\nhuman beings into diverse groups, but the identification of racialized\npeoples as unruly or a priori threats to the body politic\n(Sheth 2009, 35). Just as Muslims are assumed to be terrorists until\nproven otherwise, so all non-white groups must prove their right to\ninclusion, their right to have rights. This suggests a different\nproblematic than a decontextualized approach to the reference of racial\nconcepts.\n2. Phenomenologies of Race and Racism\n\nPhenomenology was one of the first philosophical resources that CPR\nbegan to use to explore racial effects on experience, subjectivity, and\nsocial relations. Although Existentialism and Phenomenology are\nphilosophical approaches founded by European philosophers who tended to\nignore race, the questions that these traditions focused on from the\nbeginning, concerning anguish and responsibility, freedom, temporality,\nand a prefigured social imaginary, have been of profound concern to the\ndevelopment of the Critical Philosophy of Race (Gordon 1995a, 1997; Lee\n2014, 2019; Yancy 2008; Ngo 2017).\n\nEdmund Husserl initially developed the phenomenological method as a\nway to foreground and critique what he called \u201cthe natural\nattitude\u201d: the unexamined background that helps constitute how we\nexperience the world (Husserl 1939 [1973]). The phenomenological method as\nHusserl imagined it would put this natural attitude in brackets,\nallowing for the possibility of a greater self-awareness through a\ntransformed mode of interacting with the world. Contemporary\nphenomenologists are increasingly concerned with the social structures\nthat produce and reinforce natural attitudes as well as with habits of\nunderstanding that can render our worlds comforting and predictable\n(see e.g. Weiss, Murphy, and Salamon 2019). There is also an increased\nfocus on working through the specificity of differently embodied\nperspectives, or natural attitudes that are correlated to specific\ngroup identities. For example, recent work in the phenomenology of race\nhas developed an analysis of the formation of specific first-person\nexperiences within racist societies, such as an experience of fear that\nfeels natural but is caused by racist projections.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de\nBeauvoir, Frantz Fanon, and Richard Wright began to consider the ways\nin which perception, embodiment, relations with others, experiences of\none\u2019s temporal existence, as well as the way one conceptualizes\nthe natural and social worlds could all be substantively affected by\nracial identities, even if this was latent and unarticulated (Sartre\n1946 [1948]; Beauvoir 1954 [1999]; Fanon 1952; Wright 1940). Fanon took up the\nquestion of black embodiment in anti-black societies, in which\none\u2019s actions would be interpreted by others against the backdrop\nof racist cultural images, curtailing agency and foreclosing\nindividualism as well as the recognition of one as a meaning-making\nsubject. An anticipation of anti-black responses suffuses one\u2019s\neveryday life. Sartre considered the ways in which colonization had\ncreated a situation in which the structural violence of colonizers was\nobscured and the resistance of the colonized was perceived as\nirrational. Beauvoir reflected on how her white identity restricted the\npossibilities of relations with others, reframing the meanings of her\nintended actions in ways that would reinforce racism. And throughout\nhis novels Wright explored the changed possibilities for self-making\nthat were beginning to emerge for black people with the demise of legal\nsegregation.\n\nInspired by this work, new existential categories were developed by\nLewis Gordon (1995a, 1997), Paget Henry (2000), Robert Birt (1997),\nJonathan Judaken (2008), Gertrude James Gonzalez (1997) and others to\nprovide more precise accounts of Black existence in anti-black worlds.\nFor example, there is both invisibility and hyper-visibility: the\ninvisibility of black pain and suffering, now documented in medical\nresearch, against the hyper-visibility of black bodies in spaces\nassumed to be rightfully dominated by whites, which include higher\neducation, government, and institutional leadership of all sorts, now\ndocumented by sociologists and social psychologists (Gallagher 1994;\nGordon 1995a; Williams 1997). Gordon developed an account of the\ninvisibility of black subjectivity, in which black people become\nmirrors or empty hulls, mere projections of white needs and desires.\nWhite affection for black people is similar to their affection for\ntheir pets, he argued, based on the fact that pets do not judge their\nmasters. Black people who go against these expectations to assert their\nsubjectivity and capacity to judge are subject to violence and erasure.\nGordon used a phenomenological approach not only to reveal white\nsupremacist attitudes, but also to analyze various black responses to\nanti-black racism, such as the use of the n-word as a means to deflate\nits power and divert its original meaning.\n2.1 Multiple Racisms\n\nPhenomenological approaches to race also helped to disaggregate the\nexperiences of diverse racial identities as well as expose the diverse\nforms of racism. Liberalism generally defines racism as the result of\nan illegitimate racial consciousness or racial awareness, in which the\nrace of an individual is noted and taken to be significant, setting\naside the question of who is noting who or how the significance is\nunderstood. By decontextualizing racism in this way it is rendered a\nuniform practice that could be philosophically treated in the abstract,\nwith generic solutions. By contrast, phenomenological approaches have\nsuggested that white practices of racial consciousness, among others,\nneed a distinct analysis (Sullivan 2006). White racial consciousness\noften involves self-attributions of innocence, wilful ignorance about\nrace-related social realities, and a sense of spatial entitlement that\nSullivan names \u201contological expansiveness.\u201d\n\nWhile there are some similarities in racist habits\u2014such as forms\nof group-based antipathy, denigration, and essentialism\u2014there are\nalso differences important in understanding our experiences. The very\nterm \u201canti-black racism\u201d Gordon developed indicated that\nhis analysis was not meant to be generic but specific, attending to the\nmanifestations of racism that emerge from the specific histories of\nslavery, Jim Crow, and the ongoing colonization of Africa. Emily Lee\nand David Haekwon Kim have used phenomenonological approaches to\nexplore the particularities of anti-Asian racism, Asian American\nassimilation and the idea of Asian-Americans as \u201cmodel\nminorities,\u201d in which the natural attitude of whites directs a\ndifferent set of expectations and normative judgements toward Asians\nbut ones that continue to curtail both individual and collective agency\n(Kim 2014; Lee 2020).\n\nEven when racism involves a negative projection, there is also\nalways a positive ideal against which the negative projection is\nidentifiable. The criminal black person is contrasted with the\ncompliant black, the lazy Mexican is contrasted with the hard-working\nMexican, and so on. For Asian Americans, Kim argues, the natural\nattitude of whites expects passivity, with the result that nonpassive\nAsians appear to be seeking dominance, even if their non-passivity is\nmerely sticking \u201cto an unpopular proposal in a committee\nmeeting\u201d (Kim 2020, 297). Asian assertiveness disrupts some\npeople\u2019s comfort and reveals their commitment to the idea that\nAsians are \u201csocially passive\u201d (ibid). Such attitudes are\nnot caused exclusively by cognitive commitments but operate as\naffective states that play a formative role in desire as well as\nunderstanding, such as the desirability of Asian passivity.\n\nMartin Heidegger\u2019s concept of Dasein, or \u201cbeing\nthere,\u201d understands temporal and spatial location to be\nconstitutive of subjectivity. This has provided a helpful elucidation\nof immigrant, bilingual, multilingual, and transnational experiences of\nidentity, such as many Latinx people experience, among others.\nDasein\u2019s experience of being at home in the world and being with\nothers in a comfortably collective \u201cwe\u201d state is disrupted\nby angst when the ease of this connectedness is broken by migration and\nracism. Mariana Ortega makes use of Heidegger\u2019s approach to develop\na phenomenology of migrant life, a life in which the experience of\nat-homeness is never more than fleeting. This experience disrupts the\nsolidity of the natural attitude and can lead to a critical\nconsciousness. European male existentialists sometimes portrayed the\nself as normally unreflective, with the secure ease of practical\nfunctionality within their worlds, until a crisis, such as the Nazi\noccupation of France, forces reflexivity and a new awareness of what\nhad been taken for granted. Ortega argues that the mestiza and the\nmigrant live in an everyday world of ambiguities, uncertainties of\nmeaning, and contradictory norms of practice, resulting in a\ndiscontinuous and multiplicitous self that requires a new\nphenomenological analysis (Ortega 2016, 50; see also Schutte 2000).\n2.2 Revisions of Phenomenology\n\nCPR scholars have thus effectively used phenomenology to displace\nthe concept of the normative subject. But to do this, they have also\nhad to critique the early phenomenologists attachment to universalizing\nhuman experience. For example, they have shown how particular social\nconditions, rather than universal ones, create and sustain the\npossibility of an unreflective consciousness that phenomenologists once\ntook to be the universal default. Non-dominant identities rarely have\nthe privilege of a relaxed absence of self-consciousness. In contrast,\ndominant groups have not needed to thematize their identity as, for\nexample, white or male (Ngo 2017).\n\nAs early as 1944, Sartre began to apply his concept of \u201cbad\nfaith\u201d to anti-Semitism (Sartre 1946 [1948]; Vogt 2003). \u201cBad\nfaith\u201d is the term Sartre used to describe how one lies to\noneself about the constitutive elements of the human condition\u2014most\nnotably, the inevitability of death and the responsibility we must bear\nfor our choices, even those choices constrained by social\nconditions\u2014as a way to avoid the existential angst this condition\nproduces. \u201cWe have here a basic fear of oneself and truth\u201d\n(Sartre 1946 [1948, 18]). Anti-Semitism works similarly, Sartre argued, by\nattempting to avoid the necessity of self-creation. The status of the\nGentile as constitutionally superior is rendered solid and impermeable\nno matter what one does because of its contrast with the Jew: every\ndecision the Gentile makes is legitimate, while every decision the Jew\nmakes is corrupt. Anti-Semites are intentionally antagonistic to facts\nor reasoning that would challenge their view; hence Sartre calls it a\nform of faith. Gordon took up this idea as the basis for understanding\nanti-black racism, which is motivated by the desire to maintain the\nmoral goodness and intellectual superiority of whiteness despite any\ncontrary evidence.\n\nThe use of the concept of bad faith in this way challenges\nHusserl\u2019s hopeful view about our ability to critique the natural\nattitude, given the power of bad faith\u2019s temptations and its\nintransigence to reason. But in this way, the phenomenological approach\nto race and racism has helped to reveal racism\u2019s persistence.\n\nThe phenomenological approach has also taken up the way in which\nracial identities and racisms refigure the temporal dimensions of human\nexistence. In line with Ortega, both Edouard Glissant (1989) and\nOctavio Paz (1950 [1961]) argued that in colonized spaces there can be a\nplural sense of temporality that takes a distinct form: an experience\nof the temporality of progress and development put forward by the\ndominant mainstream alongside a sensation of the static, petrified\nconditions of the marginalized periphery, creating a fractured sense of\none\u2019s temporal context that can lead to ennui. Alia Al-Saji has\nargued that understanding these diverse temporalities is key to seeing\nhow self-other relations can be short-circuited when the dominant\nperceive the marginal as existing in a distinct time-space that is\n\u201cbehind\u201d (2013, 2014). This justifies replacing dialogue\nwith pedagogy: explaining to the other how they can advance. The\ndiverse temporalities instituted by colonization, and the subsequent\npolitics of memory they engender and sometimes enforce, is a central\ntheme of decolonial philosophy today, making use of phenomenological\nwork from Fanon, Emmanuel Levinas, and other victims of racism and\nanti-Semitism to assess the aspects of our natural attitudes still\nhidden to ourselves. Further, despite the permanence of existential\ntemptations toward rendering oneself as solid and thus secure, in\ntruth, we are always in a state of becoming, with possibilities of\nplayfulness and imaginative self-creation that can lend hope for the\nbattle against racism.\n3. The Construction of Racial Identities\n\nIn general, Critical Race Philosophers have started with the view,\nfollowing Alain Locke, that race, even though it is signified by\nphysical attributes, is basically a social kind rather than a natural\nkind (Harris 1989). Locke wrote: \u201cThe best consensus of opinion\nthen seems to be that race is a fact in the social or ethnic sense,\nthat it has been very erroneously associated with race in the physical\nsense\u2026that it has a vital and significant relation to social\nculture, and that it must be explained in terms of social and\nhistorical causes\u2026\u201d (Locke 1916 [1992, 192]). Locke also\nalluded to a contradiction still very much relevant to the debate over\neliminativism, which is how racial consciousness can be both desirable\nand dangerous: desirable in that it recognizes social and historical\nrealities, but dangerous in its potential to sanction prejudice and\noverplay division (Harris 1989, 203).\n3.1 Race and the Self\n\nA central issue in the work of the Critical Philosophy of Race has\nbeen how socially instituted categories of race are related to the\nself. As Charles W. Mills has put it, the assignment of racial identity\n\u201cinfluences the socialization one receives, the life-world in\nwhich one moves, the experiences one has, the worldview one\ndevelops\u2014in short\u2026one\u2019s being and\nconsciousness.\u201d (1998, xv; emphasis in original) Given this,\nabstract notions of the self that pare away particularities of our\nidentities such as race risk producing theories and norms that tacitly\nassume whiteness, especially given the white predominance in the\nphilosophical profession.\n\nHow, then, should we understand the interaction between social\nidentities and the self? Is it deterministic from the top or more\ndialectical? In truth, the meanings of race have been influenced by\nthose victimized by racism who collectively organize for resistance and\nsurvival in racist regimes. Both individuals and social movements have\narticulated new ways to think about what it means to have a racial\nidentity (Marcano 2003; Gooding-Williams 1998; Omi and Winant 1986;\nTaylor 2004, 2016). Any theory of social construction, then, needs to\nunderstand this as a complex process with multiple players.\n3.2 The Social Construction of Race\n\nRace itself is a historically and culturally specific aspect of\nhuman experience (Gossett 1965; Hannaford 1996; Augstein 1996).\nAlthough there are precursors in earlier periods, most believe that the\nmain way the concept of race has been defined in the modern era\u2014as\nsignifying inherited, stable dispositions and capacities linked to\nphysical characteristics\u2014emerged within Europe during its era of\nglobal empire. The idea of ranked, permanent human differences\nmotivated or rationalized state policies governing a variety of social\nprotections, inclusions and exclusions, from suffrage to immigration to\nproperty rights.\n\nThis history may make race appear to be something imposed on the\nself. The idea that race has been socially constructed is sometimes\npresented in this way: that external forces have constructed social\nidentities as a way to divide and rank and ultimately exploit and\noppress. On this view, while the individual has been categorized and\ngrouped by political systems, with a subsequently curtailed (or\nmagnified) agency, we are still essentially individuals free to engage\nin self-making.\n\nOn this version of social construction, two important ideas follow.\nThe first is that philosophical treatments of the self, moral agency,\npersonal identity, linguistic capacity, normative practices of\ncognition and so on can be pursued separately from, or prior to, an\nengagement with questions of social categories of identity such as\nrace. And this accords with standard philosophical practices currently\nin place. The second implication is that the most liberating approach\nto race will be to deflate its significance and eliminate it from\nsocial life. If it is only contingently related to our identity, and\nhas been used to legitimate discrimination, we should strive to reduce\nthe power of race (Haslanger 2011; Glasgow et al. 2019). Some states,\nsuch as France, use such arguments to disallow the gathering of\nstatistics that involve racial as well as ethnic and religious\nidentity.\n\nTheories that take a social constructionist approach to race often\nunderstandably focus on the nefarious ways race has been constructed.\nYet, by unseating the biological determinist view of race, social\nconstructionist approaches can also instigate reflection on the varied\nfunctions of racial terms--to signal collectivity, for example--as well\nas their open-ended future. Philosophers of race as well as other\ntheorists have put a lot of work into showing how the concept was built\non the colonizing ideologies and practices that served economic as well\nas other ends (Harris 1999; Mills 1997, 2017). But eliminativists about\nrace have to do more than reveal the problematic genealogy of the\nconcept: they also must show that the meaning of race is uniform and\neliminating the concept is both possible and desirable.\n\nCritical Philosophers of Race have generally argued that the\nelimination of race terms will encroach on our ability to retain an\neffective historical consciousness, which hermeneuticists such as\nHans-Georg Gadamer described as central to the capacity to reason well\n(Gadamer 1975 [2004]). On the hermeneutic view, individuals engage in the work\nof judgment and interpretation while embedded within particular\ntraditions, but eliminativism could disable the self-reflection this\ncalls for. And for phenomenologists such as Sartre, at least in his\nlater works, the self is the product of a dialectical interaction\nbetween the particulars of one\u2019s social situation and the choices\none makes as an individual. As Donna-Dale Marcano explains,\nSartre\u2019s approach \u201cenables us to explain how and why\nmembers of an oppressed group positively assume and create an identity\nfor ourselves\u201d grounded in that group experience: in order to\nacknowledge the importance of this shared history as well as the forms\nof resistance that have had a hand in shaping our current social\nidentities (Marcano 2003, 25). The desirability of forgetting this\nhistory may vary across groups, since some might wish to forget\natrocities that played a role in their family enrichment, while others\nwish the world to remember the lessons of the past as well as the\nhistory of group resistance and survival. If our selves are indeed the\nproduct of dialectical engagement, a philosophical treatment of\nidentity and the self will need to incorporate the situated and\nrelational elements that play a significant role in constituting us,\nand this will include our racialized identities. This approach is not\nantithetical to a social constructionist theory but one form it can\ntake.\n\nThe history of race reveals its fundamentally social origin and many\nnefarious uses, but not the reach of its dynamism. Although race is an\nimportant element in our histories, this does not mean there are no\nsimilarities across racial groups, no significant differences within\ngroups, or that racial meanings will remain stable. Yet, still, as\nMills emphasizes, race has such a significant impact on our lives it\ncannot but affect what we know, how we know, and how we understand\nourselves in relation to our worlds (Mills 1998).\n3.3  The Historical Construction of Race\n\nThe social constructionist approach can sometimes lend itself to the\nidea that societies can bring races into existence simply by the formal\nuse of the category in, for example, official legal documents. This\nview in turn can give rise to the belief that races can be\ndeconstructed by reversing this process. The historical approach to\nracial identities offers a different, though not entirely distinct\napproach. Racial groups exist within history and are formed by\nhistorical forces, but these include not only top-down machinations of\nstates but also the collective agency of those so designated. It is not\njust state policies that construct identities, but social movements,\nboth progressive and reactionary. Through historical periods and\ncollective group action, the meanings of race can change as well as\ntheir political valence (Glasgow et al. 2019; Omi and Winant 1986; Alcoff\n2015).\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois took a Hegelian approach that understood African\npeoples in the post-slavery diaspora as engaged in a dialectic process\nof self-formation in light of their racialized treatment. Slaves had\nbeen violently dispossessed of their languages, ethnic cultures and\nreligions as a means of domination and control. Yet, rather than simply\nassimilating to the Anglo-European culture of North America, black\npeople even under slavery were creatively producing new forms of\ncultural expression and communal forms of life that gave voice to the\nsensibilities of their unique and shared historical experience (Du Bois\n1903 [1997]). Historical forces had shaped the conditions in which blackness\nbecame a feature of the self, albeit a dynamic and variable one.\n\nSimilarly, in the southern part of the Western hemisphere, theorists\nsuch as Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos and Jos\u00e9 Carlos\nMari\u00e1tegui were articulating specifically racialized forms of\nsocial identity with political implications (Vasconcelos 1925 [1997];\nMari\u00e1tegui 1928 [1993]; Von Vacano 2011). For Vasconcelos, racial\nidentities are the product of both biological and social forces, but\nracial rankings are simply tools of \u201cimperialistic policy\u201d\nto generate self-justification (Vasconcelos 1925 [1997, 33]). Vasconcelos was\nconcerned to defend racial mixing, which was a practice widespread in\nLatin America and also the target of criticism by European\nintellectuals who justified their own superior ranking on the basis of\nclaims to purity and unified cultural essences. Vasconcelos held that\nsuch claims ignore the fact that all races are in a constant process of\ninteraction and mutual influence. Diversification improves humanity, he\nbelieved, and will eventually produce a more unified or cosmic race\nstronger than any \u201cpure\u201d race. Yet, while advocating in\nthis way for mestizahe, or the mixing of races and cultures,\nVasconcelos reproduced a new form of racial ranking in which\n\u201cpure\u201d blacks and Indians were ranked lower than mixed race\npeoples, or mestizos.\n\nIn contrast, Mari\u00e1tegui criticized the way in which mestizo\nand criollo elites defined the \u201cproblem of the Indian\u201d as a\nproblem of resistance to assimilation. As a forerunner of societies\nthat define themselves today as \u201cplurinational,\u201d\nMari\u00e1tegui argued that political systems needed to recognize the\nlegitimacy of Indian identities and land claims. Indigenous groups in\nPeru had distinct ideas and practices about how to communally navigate\nland stewardship, how to practice religion, and how to express\naesthetic values, and these practices had produced flourishing\ncommunities prior to the Conquest. Indian survival was not predicated\non assimilation but on land.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, theorists tended to hold that\nthe Conquest and transatlantic slavery altered and realigned but did\nnot erase prior values, practices, or beliefs (Henry 2000). New group\nidentities carried vestiges of earlier practices and cultural ideas.\nLiberation from colonialism and emancipation from slavery created new\npolitical constituencies who had shared aspirations for new forms of\nsociety in which they could chart their own futures. These new\nconstituencies manifested some continuities with the pre-Conquest,\npre-slavery past but were also dynamic responses to new conditions and\npossibilities. For example, while diverse indigenous groups were\nforcibly realigned by territorial annexations, they responded by\ndeveloping new group identities that included pan-indigenous identity\nwhile maintaining a historical consciousness of their distinct lineage\n(Jimeno 2014; de la Cadena 2015).\n\nThe contrast between political philosophy in Latin American versus\nEurope is instructive here. The project of Latin American political\nphilosophers such Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Simon Bolivar and\nMari\u00e1tegui was never to create ideal political institutions for\nany given collection of abstract individuals, but to create workable\ninstitutions that could overcome the devastations wrought by\ncolonialism, cultural imperialism, and slavery. This required\naddressing group differences and group histories. For\nMari\u00e1tegui, the Indians of Peru deserved land rights not as\nindividuals but as specific historical peoples whose land had been\nstolen. The political philosophy of a nation such as Peru could not\nthen follow liberal theoretical traditions that treated individual\ncitizens as essentially fungible with uniform rights and duties.\n\nThis is what fueled Mart\u00ed\u2019s concern that the\nEurocentric universities of Latin America offered no \u201canalysis of\nelements peculiar to the peoples of America\u201d (Mart\u00ed 1999,\n114). As a result of their European or U.S. based curriculum,\n\u201cthe young go out into the world wearing Yankee or French\nspectacles, hoping to govern a people they do not know\u201d (ibid).\nMarti despised the concept of race, held that racism was a sin against\nhumanity, and sought to undo the racism that the Spaniards\ninstitutionalized in the colonial era (Schutte 2011). But he also held\nthat new societies must come to understand and address the fact that\ndifferent groups had distinct histories with their own \u201cvital and\nindividual characteristics of thought and habit\u2026\u201d\n(Mart\u00ed, 119) Eurocentric curricula are not universal, but\nparticular, and may have only partial relevance outside Europe. Writing\nsome decades later, the philosopher Leopoldo Zea echoed\nMart\u00ed\u2019s warning and argued that philosophical approaches\nneed to address human and cultural specificity (Zea 1986).\n\nIn many post-liberation, post-slavery writings, racial identity\nbegan to signify differently than it had for the colonizers: it came to\nmean group identities and forms of life that had been forged by\nhistorical processes involving not only colonialism but also the forms\nof resistance devised by the colonized. Generic terms like\n\u201cBlack\u201d would change their meanings to signify new group\nformations whose content or unifying elements referred both to the\nenforced diaspora as well as new forms of collectivity and resistance.\nThe generic term \u201cIndian\u201d itself denoted a widely diverse\nset of communities, initially united only in that it was used by\nsettler societies to project negative attributes on all indigenous\npeoples. In this sense the term had elements very similar to other\nracial terms. Yet it began to signify something more substantive as\nwell as more positive: a difference of historical experience, values,\nand practices that cut across many particular differences between\nindigenous groups. There is ongoing debate today about the validity of\nsuch a broad term, but there is agreement that the term\n\u201cIndian\u201d signifies not only what was done to the\npeoples it signifies, but broadly shared forms of religiosity,\ncommunity, and relationality (Teuton 2008; Pratt 2002; Burkhart\n2019).\n3.4 The Cultural Construction of Race\n\nHow should we understand the connection between racialized\nidentities and the production of cultures? \u201cCivilizations and\npeoples are not\u2026coterminous with races,\u201d as Leonard Harris\nreminds us (Harris 1999, 445). Yet there are links. For Alain Locke, as\nHarris explains, socially created races can be defined in relation to\n\u201cbeliefs, habits, customs, and informal institutional\nregulations,\u201d but these are the products of group agency rather\nthan innate: it is civilizations and peoples that decide what traits to\nencourage given particular historical circumstances (Harris 1999,\n444\u20135). While it is a mistake to see races as causes of\ncultural formations, it is also a mistake to assume that racialized\ngroup histories play no role in the \u201cbeliefs, habits,\ncustoms\u201d that play a role in surviving adversity, or, on the\nother hand, in conquering.\n\nPerhaps the most philosophically rich discussion and debate over\nrace and culture came out of the anti-colonial movement that put\nforward the concept of Negritude in the midst of anti-colonial\nstruggles in Africa and the French Caribbean. Negritude was the name\ngiven for the concept of \u201cblack culture.\u201d For some\ntheorists, such as L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dor Senghor, biologically\ncaused racial identities have cultural products that, because of their\nbiological origin, have limited transformational potential. But for\nother theorists, the production of black culture is essentially to be\nunderstood within the history of colonialism (Mosley 1999, 75).\n\nFor both Aim\u00e9 and Suzanne C\u00e9saire, Negritude was the\ncultural fruit of the historical process of intellectual\ncross-fertilization known as m\u00e9tissage. Within this\ndynamic history, new cultural forms developed that could offer\nintellectual nourishment to the developing social movements striving\nfor self-determination (Denean Sharpley-Whiting 2003, 117). \u201cFor\nus, the problem is not to make a utopian and sterile attempt to repeat\nthe past, but to go beyond\u2026It is a new society that we must\ncreate, with the help of all our brother slaves, a society rich with\nall the productive power of modern times, with all the fraternity of\nolden days\u201d (C\u00e9saire 1955 [1972, 31]). Thus, Negritude articulated\na new set of norms and values that aimed to depart from Europe\u2019s\nbarbarism. Rejecting colonialism involved turning toward rather than\naway from the historical tie to indigenous African cultures. This would\nprove to be a productive relation, since these cultures were neither\nmodern nor liberal by Europe\u2019s lights but communal, cooperative,\nand anti-capitalist, with their own forms of democracy (C\u00e9saire\n1955 [1972, 23]). Decolonization required not simply nation-building but a\nreassessment and realignment of cultural forms and related social ideas\nabout human possibilities (Getachew 2019). Negritude was the name given\nto this endeavor.\n\n To be sure, Negritude has sustained decades of critical debate\nconcerning the dangers of cultural homogenization (Sealey 2018; \nAppiah 1992; \nWilder 2015; Mosley 1999). Another line of debate concerned the\nchampioning of emotion, intuition and myth in indigenous cultures, and\nwhether this only played into the hands of white supremacists. Senghor\nresponded that the point is to redefine the sphere of emotion and the\nimportance of myth as a feature of every society. Du Bois (1903 [1997]) also\nexpressed and affirmed the idea of a specific form of spirituality,\ninspired in part by Hegel. Eventually these ideas would find resonance\nin the idea of \u201csoul\u201d as the cultural form of a people,\nanother conception with an indelible racial connotation.\n\nNegritude was motivated by the project Aime C\u00e9saire called\n\u201cdisalienation\u201d: to overcome the denigration of Africa and\nthe forced assimilation into the culture of the colonizer\n(T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 1999). Yet to be clear, disalienation for\nC\u00e9saire did not require a denial of m\u00e9tissage.\nHis own writings were influenced by the French poetry and literature he\nhad imbibed as a student, but C\u00e9saire insisted that his project\nwas to \u201ccreate a new language, one capable of communicating the\nAfrican heritage\u201d (C\u00e9saire 1955 [1972, 67]). In the colonial\ncontext of Martinique, the use of French did not need to stop but what\nwas most important was to develop \u201ca new means of\nexpression\u201d that would be \u201cAntillean French, a black French\nthat, while still being French, had a black character\u201d (ibid.).\nNegritude aimed to allow the expression of a full range of memory,\naffect, orientation, and sensibilities across the domain of many\ndiverse ethnic, religious, and language communities from which the\nslaves were kidnapped.\n\nThe emphasis on the historical construction of cultural differences\nand social identities led to diverse conclusions by different\ntheorists. Sartre came to defend the concept of Negritude against its\ndetractors, but his defense portrayed it as a transitional stage in a\nHegelian dialectical moment that would lead to a future without racial\ndifferences. (Sartre 1948 [1988]; Bernasconi 1995, 2006) Such a future may be\none that many anti-racists, people of color among them, aspire to\n(Williams 1997). But the problem, as Fanon put it, was that Sartre was\nwielding a universal historical teleology in which sacrifices of\ncollective identification and historical memory were disproportionately\ndistributed (Fanon 1959 [1967]). It is the Black man who must \u201crenounce\nthe pride of his color\u2026[accept] the twilight of his\nnegritude\u2026in order to find the dawn of the universal\u201d\n(Sartre 1948 [1988, 329]). This formulation maintained the conception of\nuniversal humanism held by the French colonizers. Fanon rejected the\nidea that negritude was simply a stage, and retorted that \u201cIt is\nthe white man who creates the Negro. But it is the Negro who creates\nnegritude\u201d (Fanon 1959 [1967, 47]).\n\nEdouard Glissant took the concept of metissage and applied\nit to the way in which we approach historical understanding to argue\nthat the danger with historical approaches lies with the assumption of\na singular history that unifies us all (Sealey 2020). \u201cOne of the\nmost disturbing consequences of colonization could well be this notion\nof a single History\u2026The struggle against a single History for\nthe cross-fertilization of histories means repossessing both a true\nsense of one\u2019s time and identity\u2026\u201d (Glissant 1989,\n93).\n\nAs Kris Sealey argues, homogenized teleologies such as Sartre\npresumes puts a stranglehold on the political imagination. Yet Fanon\nand Amilcar Cabral both worried that in some forms Negritude itself\ndownplayed dynamism, internal conflicts, and the heterogeneity of the\ndiasporic experience. Both suggested that the imaginary projections of\nhomogeneous cultural identities based on shared racialization were the\nproduct of alienated middle classes seeking an authenticity they had\nlost. While recognizing that the group specificity of cultural\nformations and ideas remained vital, they, together with Kwame Nkrumah,\nheld that we need to retain a capacity to develop historically informed\ncritiques of anti-racist philosophies (Nkrumah 1964; Cabral 1973).\n3.5 Racial Identities and Whiteness\n\nIf social identities are contextual in relation to social,\nhistorical and cultural elements, this extends to what it means to be\nwhite. Whiteness across the Americas and Europe varies, since not all\nbegan as settler states, and yet the unconscious habits and frameworks\ninculcated by white or light-skinned persons positioned as superior to\nall other groups can have some commonalities. No matter one\u2019s\nindividual political and moral commitments, a person from the dominant\ngroup will have common experiences across most of their contexts in\nlight of this feature of their social identity.\n\n In his essay, \u201cThe Souls of White Folks,\u201d Du Bois\nconsidered the effects of a perpetually reinforced idea of natural\nsuperiority and dominance on white subjectivity (Du Bois 1940\n[1986c]). His concern was the \u201cconditioned reflexes\u201d and\n\u201clong followed habits\u201d built into customs and folkways (Du\nBois 1940 [1986c], 679). The fact that the white poor and white\nworkers were promised well more than they ever received had a profound\neffect on their resentments as well as their illusions. Du Bois was\nalso interested in how a generic self-regard could be attached to such\nan insignificant fact as white skin color: what does it do to a man,\nhe asks, to believe that his skin entitles him to ownership of the\nworld? Du Bois claimed an epistemic advantage as a non-white person\nwho can discern the pathological identity complex that afflicts\nwhites. He describes himself as a non-foreigner who lives among them\nand can view them from an \u201cunusual vantage\u201d so that, as he\nput it, \u201cI see in and through them.\u201d (Du Bois 1910 [1986b,\n923]). This knowledge is terrifying for white people and animates their\nantipathy: no Emperor wants to share table with those who know he is\nnaked. The habitual practices that ensure white self-regard are\nlargely unconscious, Du Bois suggested, and whites often vigorously\nresist being made conscious of them.\n\n More recently Charles W. Mills used the concept of the\n\u201cepistemology of ignorance\u201d to describe habits of knowing\nthat the dominant consciously pursue in order to ensure that they can\nretain moral self-regard (Mills 1997). Ignorance of the reality of\nracial domination, and of its illegitimacy, certainly requires more\nconcerted effort in the recent period. One must consciously avoid\ncertain books, courses, films, television shows, newspaper articles,\nand so on, but one must also attach oneself to certain ideas about\nobjectivity, the irrelevance of genealogy in assessing a claim, and the\nabsoluteness of truth claims that obviate the need for self-reflection.\nJos\u00e9 Medina (2012) has developed this idea further to explore\nhow self-knowledge has been curiously circumscribed in mainstream\ntraditions of epistemology to exclude knowledge of others or knowledge\nof one\u2019s society. If we are what we are always in relation to\nothers, he argues, then knowledge of others, and of the social\nconditions we must all inhabit, is a necessary condition of\nself-knowledge.\n\nShannon Sullivan (2006) has explored the idea of unconscious habits\nof whiteness more broadly. Her work has developed some aspects of\npsychoanalytic theory and pragmatism to explore the common elements of\nwhite racial identity formation. This proves a fruitful way to consider\nhow racism can be effectively passed down across generations without\nconscious intent. Bodily posture toward a person of color who comes to\none\u2019s door can convey a whole array of ideas to children without\nneeding to be stated. Sullivan elaborates a host of sometimes\nunconscious assumptions in white ways of being, involving entitlement,\nfear, guilt, and other affective states. Sullivan has looked\nparticularly at \u201clived spatiality\u201d: the way in which\ndiverse groups live their spatiality and understand themselves in\nrelation to specific spaces. Given the \u201cownership\u201d idea\nattached to whiteness, and the historical practices of forming\nsettlements in foreign lands, a phenomenological approach to the\nracialization of lived spatiality can reveal sediments of assumed white\nprivilege that can affect such current issues as gentrification and the\nreemergence of white nationalism. Some of these habitual practices\ncommon to white subjectivity may be formulated as epistemically\npraiseworthy (for example, aspiring to colorblindness, ignoring\nhistory, or the motivation to \u201cdiscover\u201d unknown lands and\nmake one\u2019s mark upon the world).\n3.6 Future Directions\n\nThe analysis of race and the self, then, includes unconscious habits\nas well as subjective features produced by collective experience. Yet\nan important theme of CPR has been an attentiveness to\nm\u00e9tissage, as well as a defense of mestizahe\nand the productive creolizations of cultures that have been too little\nacknowledged. Although clearly marked cultural borders and pure lines\nof racial descent are praised and pursued by racist social systems,\nthey have never been achieved in reality. Our plural lineages and\ninfluences mean that, to some extent, we all operate within what are\ncalled pluritopic hermeneutic frameworks, rather than monotopic,\nhomogenous, or coherent hermeneutic frameworks (Mignolo 2012). This\nfact does not imply that we can go back to taking a universal\n\u201cwe\u201d as a starting point, or some form of abstract\nindividualism. Perhaps we are all pluritopic today, but racialized\nsubjectivity is formed differently vis-\u00e0-vis power.\n\nAlain Locke insisted on the fact that \u201cmost cultures\u201d\nhave been found to be \u201chighly composite\u201d: \u201cthe\nresultant of the meeting and reciprocal influence of several culture\nstrains, several ethnic contributions. Such facts nullify two of the\nmost prevalent popular and scientific fallacies, the ascription of a\ntotal culture to any one ethnic strain, and the interpretation of\nculture in terms of intrinsic rather than the fusion values of its\nvarious constituent elements\u201d (Locke 1924 [1989, 195]). Locke took this\nfeature of cultures to provide a definitive rejoinder to supremacist\nclaims, since the cultural achievements of societies marked by white\nsupremacy bear the influences of subordinated groups.\n\nIt remains true, however, that as we saw with Vasconcelos, ideas of\nmixing can and have co-existed alongside and even supported racism\n(Bernasconi 2010). The slipperiness of racial meanings and the\nflexibility of racism requires philosophers to continually assess the\ncontextual conditions within which any given philosophical claim is\noperating.\n4.  The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture\n\nA central issue of debate in the Critical Philosophy of Race has been\nhow to understand the causes of racism in relation to economic\nmotivations and the system of capitalism as well as cultural forces\nand social ideology. Orthodox Marxists often sidelined issues of\nracism, diminishing the struggle against racism as a struggle for\nbourgeois rights within a legal system that would remain structurally\nunjust under capitalism. Some thought the focus on racism would divide\nthe working class and weaken solidarity. Despite the weakness of these\narguments, it remains true that some anti-racist agendas sideline\neconomic issues and focus on representational equity at the top of the\npyramid. This has led to an ongoing debate about how to relate the\nissue of race with the issue of class (Grosfoguel 2016).\n4.1 Race and Class\n\nRacism is very profitable. It can work to reduce compensation for\njobs designated \u201cunskilled\u201d or \u201clow skilled\u201d\nbecause the articulation of \u201cskill\u201d values mental over\nmanual labor and often misrepresents the complex demands of the latter.\nRacist prejudices incline some to accept the idea without examination\nthat the labor done by racialized groups is unskilled. All manual\nworkers are disrespected and shut out of decision making, but the\nracial organization of the labor market makes this sector more\nnon-white than other sectors, and in some locations, such as Latin\nAmerica or South Africa, almost entirely non-white. Racial divisions\namong workers are regularly exploited by capitalists to diminish\nsolidarity. Neo-colonialism in the global south continues to facilitate\nthe exploitation of labor in countries too desperately poor to\nnegotiate terms very effectively. In truth, then, both national and\ntransnational markets in labor and goods have been racially organized\nsince the Conquest of the Americas for the benefit of elites. Even when\nthe elite class is multi-racial, they benefit from the racist system of\norganizing and remunerating labor. This is the meaning of the term\n\u201cracial capitalism\u201d (Robinson 1983; Mills 1997).\n\nClearly, emerging capitalism made use of the racist ideologies\ninitiated in the early days of colonialism, such as the idea that\nNative peoples and African peoples exist in an earlier stage of human\ndevelopment and are thus legitimately subject to governance and control\nby more advanced or developed human cultures (Grosfoguel and\nCervantes-Rodr\u00edguez 2002; Quijano 2008). Capitalism also profits\nfrom the denigration of the value of indigenous cultures around the\nworld, especially when these thwart mining, logging, or other types of\nresource extraction and the transformation of environments upon which\ngroups depend for their subsistence. On the other hand, some argue that\nbecause capitalism has no intrinsic need to respect cultural\ntraditions, it often upends traditions involving racism and sexism when\nthese conflict with its labor needs: for example, the profit motive\nencourages hiring the best from any group for its\nprofessional/managerial and creative teams. One of the prime features\nof capital markets is their tendency to disrupt existing social\nconventions. These points have raised debate over whether capitalism is\nnecessarily committed to the maintenance of racism. And\nfurther debate has arisen over whether racist ideologies are intrinsic\nto cultures or to economies, or both.\n\nMost critical theorists of race and ethnicity argue for an expansion\nbeyond economic analyses. Ella Shohat and Robert Stam hold that\n\u201cWhile political economy is absolutely essential to any\nsubstantive left critique, it is also important to articulate culture\nand economy together, to conceive of them as existing in and through\neach other\u201d (2016, 421). In this vein, the cultural theorist\nStuart Hall developed what he called a heterodox Marxist approach to\nrace, emphasizing the role of culture in producing the hegemony\nrequired to maintain the racial organization of labor (Mills 2010,\n186). Yet Hall rejected the idea that culture operates as a sufficient\ncause or is separable from material conditions (Hall 1980 [2002], 1997a, 1997;\nMorley and Chen 1996). Hall\u2019s approach to the importance of\nculture in regard to racism was inspired by 20th century\nMarxist theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and those\nassociated with the Frankfurt School, although these theorists avoided\naddressing race. Some did address anti-Semitism and the links between\nthe rise of authoritarian societies and the forms of group hatred the\nNazi\u2019s promoted, but they wrote little about racism or\ncolonialism (Allen 2016; Farr 2018). Hall suggests however that\nGramsci\u2019s origins in southern Italy informed his understanding of\nhow regional ethnic identities could animate prejudice and play a\nformative role in the crafting of hegemony.\n \n Gramsci\u2019s concept of hegemony focused on the ways in which\nbroad majorities come to accept significant income inequality and\ndiminished democracy, reducing the need for capitalist states to use\nbrute force.  Gramsci suggested we must reach beyond economic motives\nto explain the success of hegemony. To avoid a mono-causal approach to\nracial domination, Hall adapted three concepts from Gramsci and\nAlthusser: hegemony (the production of cross-class acceptance of\nsocial injustice), relative autonomy (for cultural forces that\nsometimes operate autonomously from profit maximization), and\noverdetermination (the necessity \u201cto grasp the multiplicity of\nsocial determinations in play \u2013 and the fact that they work in\ncombination, as an articulation of different forces\u201d [Hall 2017,\n90]). For Hall, the significance of this overall approach is to alert\nus to potential misalignments between causative elements, so that the\npower of social determinism is understood to have some\ninstability. Further, we can see how non-economic motives can drive\nthe choices of both workers and capitalists. One may be motivated to\nmaintain one\u2019s social position in a racial hierarchy, for\nexample, and to ensure that racial groups considered lesser are not\ngaining social and economic advantages, even if this compromises\none\u2019s ability to fight capital.\n\nHowever, if we assume that racial identities are epiphenomenal\nillusions or imaginary in some sense, such motives will fall under the\ncategory of false consciousness, in which case race-based motivations\nwill not challenge economic determinism. One\u2019s \u201creal\u201d\n\ninterests as a worker will continue to lay in opposing racial\ndivisions. As discussed earlier in this entry, the idea that racial\nconcepts are illusory may seem to have good evidentiary grounds. Yet\nracial categories that operated within the emerging settler states,\nsuch as the United States and Australia, distributed significant\nprivileges and protections by race. These included both economic and\npolitical rights, including homestead rights, voting rights, and labor\nrights. In this way, socially created kinds such as racial identities\nhad a powerful social reality: even if some of the ideas about such\nidentities are false, real historical events produced shared\nexperiences and shared sets of interests (Beltr\u00e1n 2020).\n \n\nThe fact that racial groups are led to compete with one another for\neconomic advantages is itself socially engineered rather than natural,\nbut it may have heterogeneous causes. The concept of overdetermination\nallows us to expand the concept of what is in one\u2019s rational\n\u201cinterest\u201d to include pride and self-regard, group\nself-affirmation, relational advantage over other groups, the desire to\nenact domination and to protect longstanding special entitlements. Is\nthe imbrication of this complex array of motives such that we should\nsee the economic as the main determinant, operating behind what look to\nbe identity-protections? In other words, are racist motives ultimately\ncaused by a choice structure crafted by capitalists?\n4.2 Racist Cultures\n\nSome argue that the structural racism of modern European societies\n(and European-based societies such as the United States) is deeply\nembedded in their cultures and languages in ways that are concealed by\ntheir espousal of classical liberalism\u2019s dominant concepts of\nindividualism, equality, and freedom (Goldberg 1993, pp. 6\u20137; see also\nMills 2017). It is liberalism that espouses neutrality and\ncolor-blindness as ideal norms for social interaction, leading to an\nunwillingness to engage with racial realities in social institutions\nand economic outcomes. David Theo Goldberg argues that liberal cultures\nare racist in taking difference to be a problem requiring assimilation,\nintegration, and \u201cnormalization\u201d in Foucault\u2019s sense\nof a comparative ranking that justifies forcible conformity. People of\ncolor and non-European immigrants who reject the color-blind ideal are\nseen as not yet assimilated into advanced, modern ways of life, and\nthus incapable of self-governance. Every articulation of anti-racist\nrage and rebellion can then be cast aside as based in ignorance. If\nthese groups knew how to work within liberal democratic institutions\nand educational systems, some believe, they would be faring better with\nno need to rebel. In a sense, then, the suffering of nonwhites is\nviewed as self-caused by their inferior cultures, leading to a\nhegemonic acceptance of social inequality. The liberal view, as opposed\nto the conservative view, is distinguished only in that it sees this\ndeficiency as remediable with assimilation.\n\nA key element of Goldberg\u2019s approach is to highlight the\nmalleability of racial and racist discourses: just as liberalism has\nmorphed into neo-liberalism, with its emphasis on self-maximizing\nstrategies, individual responsibility, and punitive attitudes toward\nthose who cannot effectively monetize their talents, so old-school\nbiological racism morphs into cultural racism: the problem is not\nnonwhite genes but nonwhite cultures. Against those who take race to\nsimply mean biology, Goldberg holds that the language of race can\ncontinue its noxious effects without any recourse to \u201cbiological\nreference\u201d (1993, 11). Goldberg proposes that the West is made up\nof racist cultures so deeply committed to racism that new forms emerge\nas soon as old ones lose their power. Cultures are inherently dynamic,\ncounseling against a metaphysically inclined pessimism, but the\ndynamism and plasticity of racism requires permanent vigilance.\n\nGoldberg and Cornel West have independently made use of the\nFoucauldian concepts such as \u201cfields of discourse\u201d and\n\u201cepistemes\u201d to suggest that racial ideas are reinforced by\nloose coherence relations without logical entailments or causal\ndeterminism (West 1982). Familiar ways of organizing and achieving\nknowledge\u2014such as classification tables\u2014resonate across quite\ndifferent disciplines and projects and help to guide, and control, the\nformulation of intelligible objects and problematics. Human\ndifferences, West suggests, were mapped in the 18th and 19th centuries\nvia small visual variations to resonate with the ways in which\nbotanists organized typologies of flora and fauna, as if such mapping\nconstituted knowledge.\n\nDespite their variety, racist cultures tend to portray racial\nidentities and racism as natural in a way that obscures their\nhistorical construction. Although the 19th century theories and\npractices in regard to race have been discredited and largely rejected,\nthe ways in which race is approached today in both the social and\nnatural sciences retain some continuity with these problematic\nhistories, with disturbing effects: \u201cThe scientific cloak of\nracial knowledge, its formal character and seeming universality,\nimparts authority and legitimation to it\u201d (Goldberg 1993,\n149).\n\nFoucault\u2019s focus was on the ways in which knowledge projects\nare framed, confining those so defined \u201cwithin the constraints of\nthe representational limits\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 152). Such projects\nhave typically assumed that the most important goals are uplift,\nassimilation, and integration with whites rather than extending\ndemocracy or reformulating justice (Shelby 2018). Knowledge projects\nare themselves conducted in ways that can exacerbate epistemic\ninjustice: \u201cThe Other, as object of study, may be employed but\nonly as informant, as representative translator of\nculture\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 150; see also Narayan 1997 and Bayruns\nGarcia 2019). Concepts in use today such as \u201cghettos,\u201d\n\u201cganglands,\u201d \u201cinner cities,\u201d\n\u201cunderclass,\u201d and \u201cpuppet governments\u201d operate\nin a similar manner as older concepts like \u201csavages,\u201d\n\u201cprimitives,\u201d and \u201cbarbarians\u201d to reify and\nnaturalize peoples, neighborhoods, and cultures (Goldberg 1993,\n152\u2013155).\n\nResonating effects between the new language and the old does more than\nsupport their plausibility, as Goldberg points out:\n\u201cnoncontroversial meanings [of terms such as \u2018inner\ncity\u2019 or \u2018underclass\u2019] offer to their racialized\nones the aura of respectability, just as their racial connotations\nspill over silently, unself-consciously, and so unproblematically into\ntheir racialized ones\u201d (1993, 155). New meanings for old terms\ncan emerge as needed by new contexts and new social projects, but with\npersistently problematic connotations. The concept of the\n\u201cprimitive\u201d was originally intended to refer to ancient\nsocial groups from which contemporary human societies are descended;\nonly later did it become a synonym for the racially other and the\nculturally \u201cbackward\u201d. In this case the meaning remained\nstable while the referent group shifted. Ancient social groups that\nwere nomadic, polygamous, and communal rather than individualist were\nthen tagged onto nonwhite groups that exist today, such as indigenous\ngroups in Africa and Latin America. \n4.3 Racist Social Sciences\n\nBoth CPR and CRT scholars have shown how a significant amount of\nsocial science research has been functional for the state, with dubious\nresults: providing information, data, statistical regularities that are\nused to formulate state policies; assuming frameworks that overlook\nagency and divert attention from considerations of justice (Murakawa\n2014; Shelby 2018; Bauman 2003; Darby and Rury 2018). Statistics gathering on\nrecidivism rates correlated to race are still used in parole decisions,\nas if recidivism is a natural fact or caused by bad individual choices\nrather than inadequate social services and prejudicial labor markets.\nIn this way social science continues to participate in the construction\nof social ontologies, such as \u201clikely repeat offender,\u201d\nthrough feedback loops between representation and reality. Social\nsciences can then represent racial Others in an ostensibly neutral way\nwhile protecting white dominance (Goldberg 1993, 174).\n\nTo believe that we simply need to find more politically correct\nalternatives for terms like \u201cunderclass\u201d or\n\u201cprimitive\u201d is to assume that the object of reference can\nbe defined and demarcated within racist cultures outside of a racist\nlinguistic system. If we understand racism to be infecting the\ndelimitation of fields of knowledge and the formation of objects as\nwell as associated meanings, then the task must be to critically assess\ncultures, discourses, and institutions at every level. The project of\ninquiry then becomes one of understanding how racial domination has\nbeen reproduced across generations, encompassing political\nsensibilities from conservatism to liberalism.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s approach may be interpreted by some as a postmodern\napproach that has gone too far in conferring sufficient\ncausality to language or discourse (see e.g. Mills\u2019 critique of\nHall, 2010, on this same point). Yet both Goldberg and Hall continually\nemphasize material structures alongside linguistic and discursive ones.\nThere remains the question of how to understand the relation between\nthese various aspects of racist cultures. The question of whether there\nare ultimate or sufficient causes, however, does not animate\nGoldberg\u2019s work. His goal is to unearth the cultural and\ndiscursive elements involved in the constitution, perpetuation, and\nfluid transformations of racist concepts and racist societies. We need\nto understand the constitutive discourses operating in the social\nsciences to grasp how it can be the case that they \u201chave done\nmuch to create, authorize, legitimate, and extend both the figures of\nthe racial Otherness and the exclusion of various\nracisms\u201d (Goldberg 1993, 175).\n Other philosophers who analyze the social sciences have also\noffered a strong critique of existing frameworks and policy approaches\n(esp. Darby and Rury 2018 meant; Shelby 2018). Tommie Shelby critiques\nmainstream work on racial poverty in the social sciences for\ndownplaying the agency of the poor as well as the rationality and\nmoral reasoning that can motivate decisions to self-segregate, for\nexample, or, at times, to resist certain kinds of wage labor. Ghetto\npoverty is caused by macro structural forces, but the collection of\nindividuals forced into these spaces are actively endeavoring to\nsurvive, to occasionally flourish, and also to foment resistance of\none sort or another. We cannot explain their choices by their culture\n(as in the \u201cculture of poverty\u201d thesis) but by their\nchoice situation. We also need frameworks that allow theorists to see\nthe creative and assertive responses devised by collective effort (the\nassertiveness of rap, for example, that re-describes social worlds\nagainst dominant misrepresentations). Shelby no less than Goldberg\ntakes apart the linguistic apparatus that produces a large body of\nsocial science functional for racial capitalism. And his use of what\nis a usually denigrating term \u2013 \u201cghetto\u201d \u2013 may\nbe seen as an instance of what Goldberg calls \u201cstanding inside\nthe terms\u201d as a means to transform and redirect their political\neffects (1993, 174).\n\nCritical philosophers of race, even those influenced by\npostmodernism, tend to set limits on the plasticity of linguistic\ntransformation. Goldberg suggests that those designated by the term\n\u201cprimitive,\u201d such as indigenous groups, \u201care rarely\nin a position of power, politically and technologically, to take on the\ncategory as a form of self-reference, even should they choose to\u201d\n(1993, 174). Speech, however constitutive its reach, exists in a\nmaterial world.\n4.4 Racist Constructions of Women of Color\n\nCritical race feminist philosophers have developed a critical\nanalysis of the ways in which categories such as \u201cBlack\nwomen\u201d as well as \u201cwomen of the global south\u201d have\nbeen constituted as an academic object of study and analysis (Narayan\n1997; Khader 2011, 2018; duCille 1997). Uma Narayan argued that\nrepresentations of women in India reproduce naturalistic frames and\nglobal hierarchies that devised a version of the culture of poverty\nthesis on an international scale. Notably, violence against women in\nthe global north is not generally given cultural explanations but\nportrayed as a problem of individual pathology or an undifferentiated\nmisogyny that operates outside of specific histories and contexts. By\ncontrast, women of the global south are portrayed as oppressed by their\ncultures and religions.\n\nSerene Khader expands on this analysis to show how culturalist\nexplanations result in underestimating the agency of women in the\nglobal south, creating the view that their agency is only possible when\nthey completely reject their religion or culture. This is a problem not\nonly in the social sciences but also in postmodern feminist theory, and\nit occludes possibilities of universalist feminism because the\noppressed Third World woman constructed in this way requires uplift,\nnot dialogic engagements in which there might develop a larger\nunderstanding of the complex nature of sexism as well as the multiple\npossibilities of liberation from sexism. In some writings, the Third\nWorld woman is reified to such a degree that no serious political\nengagement about how to formulate shared feminist aims is possible.\n\nKhader develops an approach to adaptive preferences that allows for\nnon-ideal and historically attuned assessments of choices in any given\ncontext. All gendered individuals in reality make choices within\nstructured environments. Outsiders to these environments tend to\nmisdiagnose women\u2019s choices, viewing them as accepting of\noppression when in truth they may be efforts at self-protection.\nMistaken analyses can also occur when cultures are reified as static;\nif we drop this idea Khader suggests we can judge choices based on\ntheir potential for transitions. For example, covering can enable women\nto venture out of the home without risk, and lead to changed public\nspheres. She argues for an approach that attends to contextual\nconditions of all sorts \u2013 material and cultural \u2013 for\nunderstanding oppression and gauging effective resistance.\nContextualization will yield pluralist rather than uniform notions of\nliberation from gender-based oppression, and Western feminists need to\nbe open to a multiplicity of liberatory forms even including certain\nkinds of gender-based divisions of labor.\n\nAnn duCille takes a critical look at how the category \u201cBlack\nwomen\u201d has been constructed within postmodernism, as well as\nother radical theoretical platforms. It is problematic to take Black\nwomen as the quintessential Other or the paradigm of difference\n(duCille 1997; Davidson 2010). Black women can be\nepistemically privileged in a way that does not reify their otherness,\nconcealing its contextualization and internal variability. Maria del\nGuadalupe Davidson takes up duCille\u2019s challenge to rethink the\ncategory by drawing from Gilles Deleuze\u2019s concept of \u201cthe\nfold\u201d as an alternative approach to identity and subjectivity.\nThis presents an approach to subjectivity as constitutively relational.\nIf theorists will focus on activity and relationality, rather than\nbeing, we may be able to specify unique conditions of Black women\nwithout reification (Davidson, 2010, 128\u2013130).\n\nDebates continue about how to formulate racial identities as well as\nwhether identity-based movements have overshadowed class-based\nmovements. Shohat and Stam explain that the focus on identity should be\nseen against the backdrop of a larger project of global decolonization,\nrather than assumed to be forever complicit with neo-liberalism (2016).\nThe point is not to replace the frame of class struggle, but to\ncomplicate it, bringing ongoing forms of cultural imperialism to the\ncenter of analysis, so that we can begin to discern the\n\u201cmultiaxial forms of resistance and struggle\u201d that face\ndown \u201cmultiaxial forms of oppression\u2026shaping new social\nactors, new vocabularies, and new strategies.\u201d (2016, 421)\n5. Reconstituting the History of Philosophy\n\nThe racist beliefs of major figures in the traditional canon of modern\nphilosophy went unexplored until the second half of the\n20th century. Most historians of philosophy assumed that\ncanonical figures were simply men of their time, and that their racism\nwas devoid of philosophical interest and significance. Critical race\nphilosophers have opened up debate on these issues, such as how the\nracism of important philosophers such as Locke and Kant may require us\nto reassess standardly generous interpretations of their political and\nethical views (Zack 2017; Taylor et al. 2018; Mills 2017; Bernasconi\nand Mann 2005). They have also argued that bringing racism to the fore\nwill require changing the standard ways of doing the history of\nphilosophy.\n5.1. Doing Philosophy Differently\n\nFirst, a change in interpretive methods is in order, to\nchange the way in which we read canonical texts. Before we assume that\nthe racism of a given philosopher was typical of their day, we need to\nexplore the historical context and consider the written views of his or\nher contemporaries so that we can reasonably assess what any given\nphilosopher \u201ccould or should have known\u201d about, for\nexample, slavery (Bernasconi 2018, 3). In fact, as recent work has\nshown, throughout the modern period, slavery and colonialism were\nsubject to vigorous debates both by those inside and outside of\nimperial nations (Jeffers 2018; Valls 2005; Mehta 1999; Pitts 2006;\nDussel 2018, 2013; Mosley 2017). A thorough examination of the\nintellectual scene in which canonical philosophers were ensconced\nraises new questions about their views and assumptions (Bernasconi and\nMann 2005; Ward and Lott 2002). But such an examination requires that\nwe contextualize philosophical texts historically and socially before\nwe can justify our interpretations.\n\nSecond, the existing canon has too many omissions on crucial issues,\nespecially in regard to moral and political debate, to be taken as\nsufficient unto itself, given that such topics as slavery were\nextensively discussed and debated by other theorists in the same time\nperiod. The question of how to expand, if not reconstitute, the canon\nof modern philosophy has generated debate over what constitutes\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d writings as opposed to other sorts. It is\nimportant to remember that the canon of modern European philosophers\ndoes not include only professional philosophers working within\nuniversities: such professionals did not even appear until the\nbeginning of the 19th century. And the issue of what makes a\ntext count as a philosophical argument is of course subject to further\ndebate. Many of the already accepted canonical European texts come in\nthe form of letters, memoirs, fiction, dialogues, interpretations of\nsacred writings, and journalistic essays. Think of Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions, Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, Hume\u2019s Dialogues on\nNatural Religion, Pascal\u2019s Pensees, The Federalist Papers,\nNietzsche\u2019s Thus Spake Zarathustra, or Edmund Burke\u2019s\nReflections on the Revolution in France. Philosophers read texts in a\nphilosophical manner even when the text itself is not written in the\nform of a logically ordered argument.\n\nThere is original philosophical work in Africana, Latin American,\nindigenous and other traditions on metaphysics, morality, aesthetics\nand a whole host of philosophical issues that should become part of a\nrevised canon (Jeffers 2018; Henry 2000; Dussel 2013, 2018; Wiredu\n2004; Maffie 2013). The existence of original philosophical work in\nancient China and India is not as contested, yet these sources are also\nabsent representation in many so-called \u201ctop\u201d graduate\nprograms. Hence, there is an unjustificable Eurocentrism in the\nexisting canon\u2019s formation. The question of whether a given work\ncounts as philosophy cannot be decided upon by a priori\ncriteria created by a foreshortened canon. Therefore, we need to engage\nin both critical and reconstructive work on the question of canonicity\nitself.\n\nThe third point follows from the last. The traditional canon is not\nonly insufficient but problematic in ways that require new analyses and\ninterpretations. Without doing this critical work, taking concepts\ndeveloped within modern Western political philosophy as the foundation\nfrom which to build further theories of social justice may result in\nextending the life of racist ideas and failing in our anti-racist aims\n(Mills 1998; Gines 2014; Basevich 2020; Zack 2017; Taylor et al. 2018).\nConcepts that look to be neutral on issues of race may have racist\neffects even without racist motivations, such as the labor theory of\nvalue that excuses the appropriation of lands from indigenous groups,\nor concepts of equality that may be formulated in a way that assumes\nsameness, or ontologies of the self that obscure relationality and\ndependence on hierarchical social infrastructures. Thus, it is not\nmerely that the traditional canon needs to be augmented: it needs a\nthorough critical analysis that puts ideas and concepts in their\nhistorical context, explores their real-world applications, and then\nconsiders the reasons for their influence and popularity\nvis-\u00e0-vis other possible positions available at the time or,\nfrankly, even now.\n5.2 The Revelations of Contextualization\n\nTo reiterate, a historical and cultural contextualization of\nphilosophical ideas is perhaps the most crucial methodological reform\nneeded to change the way we understand the history of philosophy, and\ncontextualization is just as important in regard to present day work as\nfor philosophy written in the distant past. Contemporary approaches to\nphilosophical historiography have sometimes assumed that\ncontextualization is unnecessary, but this assumption, left\nunchallenged, can constrain critical analysis. When traditional\nhistorians of philosophy have begun to engage with questions of race,\nthe problematics have sometimes been foreshortened by decontextualized\nmethods of analysis. In this vein, Robert Bernasconi argues that\nnaturalistic tendencies in analytic philosophy have overemphasized the\nquestion of whether a given philosopher believed in race as a natural\nkind, resulting in a limited interpretive exploration (2012,\n552\u2013553).\n\nTake, for example, Du Bois\u2019s rich 1899 [1986a] text \u201cThe\nConservation of Races\u201d where he elaborates an account of African\nAmericans as a distinct historical people. Du Bois\u2019s account was\nreduced in a number of contemporary critical essays to the question of\nwhether he meant \u201cblack\u201d to refer to biology, in which\nbiological concepts themselves were understood as free of culture. But\nfrom phenomenology\u2019s point of view, the philosophical\nconceptualization of nature, and the current political uses made of\nnaturalist claims, are themselves cultural artifacts, historically and\nculturally contingent. Thus, when we read the history of modern\nEuropean philosophy, we need to be alive to the ways in which\n\u201cnature\u201d is being socially constructed and conscripted for\nphilosophical projects.\n\nCPR has worked to advance new interpretations of canonical\nphilosophers but has also, at the meta-level, contested standard\napproaches to interpretation. The interpretation of Kant, for example,\nhas had to contend with his extensive writings on anthropology and\ngeography in which he espoused unambiguously racist claims (Elden and\nMendieta 2011; Kant 1798 [2012]). Until recently this large body of writings\nwas considered irrelevant to the understanding of Kant\u2019s ethics\nor his cosmopolitanism on the grounds of disciplinary distinctions\nbetween philosophical work and other writings. But why ignore\nKant\u2019s writings about the nature of human difference if we are\ntrying to understand his actual views about the way peoples should\ninteract? Like feminist philosophers who developed an analysis of the\nsubtle ways in which some moral theories assumed a male embodiment,\nCritical Philosophers of Race have shown that doctrines of\nself-determination and universal reciprocity developed by modern\nEuropean philosophers were never intended to apply to all groups: the\nright to autonomy was based on certain capacities that legitimated the\nexclusion of children, the disabled, and usually women, but, also,\nnon-Europeans who were viewed as developmentally \u201cbehind\u201d.\nTaking some aspect of a philosophers\u2019 view and giving it the most\ngenerous reading possible distorts our understanding of modern\nphilosophy and its conceptual offerings (Basevich 2020;\nShorter-Bourhanou forthcoming; Kirkland 2018).\n\nMills argues that the only way to make sense of the evident\ncontradictions in modern European philosophy is to understand this body\nof work as distinguishing types of selves among the human race\n(Mills 1998). Because of these type-differences, anti-authoritarian\nreforms and demands for democracy were never meant to be extended to\nthe colonies. Sub-persons (women, slaves, the members of inferior\ncultures) did not merit suffrage, freedom, consultation, or\nself-determination. There was debate over whether these groups would\nremain forever inferior, less than human, or whether they might advance\n(Boxill 2005). But even those, like Rousseau, who believed in the\npossibility of uplift, assumed that \u201cpersons\u201d would be the\nones showing \u201csub-persons\u201d the way forward, and judging\ntheir progress.\n5.3 Questioning \u2018modernity\u2019 itself\n\nLucius Outlaw characterizes modern European philosophers as sharing\na commitment to a \u201cproject of modernity\u201d that aimed to put\nall human activity \u201cunder the aegis of\n\u2018reason\u2019\u201d (1996, 147; see also Kirkland 2018; Yancy\n2020; Dussel 1995, 2013, 2018; McCarthy 2009; Mehta 1999). Despite a\ndiversity of approaches and disagreements, the modern Europeans shared\na distinctive philosophy of history that defined progress as the\nexpansion of freedom and rationality. Social institutions and cultures\ncould then be compared and ranked in regard to this singular metric of\nuniversal development. It was useful for Empire, as Outlaw argues, to\nreframe the wide expanse of alterity among human beings and cultures as\ndevelopmental differences. The possibilities of a true pluralism was\nthen foreclosed by norms of modernity. The unfortunate result still\nwith us is that the impetus to study current social and cultural\ndifferences in thought, or the variety of philosophical writings, is\ndiminished on the grounds that these constitute inessential and\naccidental aspects of the human condition, irrelevant to the\nformulation or discernment of freedom and reason. Eurocentrism in\nphilosophical curricula is then no accident, Outlaw concludes, nor is\nit viewed as a deficiency since the modern European canon is assumed to\nprovide sufficient elaboration and debate over the universal principles\nof freedom and reason.\n\nThus, this project of modernity gave birth to a\n\u201cfalse universalism that blocks the appreciation of racial and\nethnic differences\u2026and contributed to deceptions that masked\nvarious forms of domination that were\nrationalized\u2026\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 150). Critical social theory\nworthy of the name needs to embrace a pluralism of philosophical\nprojects, concepts, and frameworks that have arisen from differently\nsituated thinkers from diverse regions or group experiences who are\naddressing, at least in some cases, dissimilar puzzles and challenges.\nA pluralist approach to philosophical projects can then engage in\ncritical dialogue across these differences. The point of noting real\nphilosophical alterities for Outlaw is not to counsel empty tolerance\nbut to avoid presumptive judgments based on putative universals crafted\nby only one side.\n\nQuestioning European projects of modernity has been productively\ndisruptive of the staid problematics that have dominated numerous\nsub-fields, from political philosophy to aesthetics to epistemology\n(Narayan and Harding 2000; Dotson 2012, 2014; Taylor 2016). Previously,\nthe focal points that dominated these sub-fields, such as skepticism,\nideal forms of justice, the universal nature of aesthetic value, and so\non, came exclusively from modern European or ancient Greek\nphilosophers. The recent critical work is challenging the hegemony of\nthe traditional canon in setting out the agenda for philosophy. To be\nsure, previous movements in philosophy have also made progress in\nexpanding the problematics, such as pragmatism, post-structuralism,\nsocial epistemology, feminist philosophy, and others. New questions\nhave made it to the table, and old questions have had new\nformulations.\n\nParticularly important has been the transformation of political\nproblematics, reaching well beyond the debates over liberalism,\nconservatism, and Marxism (McGary 1999; Cohen 1999, Gooding-Williams\n2009; Shelby 2018; Lugones 2003; Corlett 2003 and 2010; Darby and Rury\n2018; Hanchard 2018). The move from ideal to non-ideal approaches has\nplayed a particularly productive role in opening up the field of\npolitical philosophy to engage with racial injustice and inequality\n(Mills 2005). Non-ideal approaches have cast new light on ideal\nconceptions of normative, optimally functional behavior. Shelby,\nGooding-Williams, and Cathy Cohen have all, in different ways, turned\nto the project of investigating \u201chow [so-called] deviant\npractices can be transformed into political challenges to the power\nthat the state exercises over the ghetto poor through the promotion and\nenforcement of [illegitimate] norms\u201d (Gooding-Williams 2009,\n251). Gooding-Williams indicts Du Bois\u2019s adoption of mainstream\nnorms of respectability in his account of the Philadelphia ghettos and\nsuggests that we look instead to Frederick Douglas as the better\npolitical philosopher for emancipation (see also James 1997). The\nproject of civilizing Black people was a strategy that would only\nensure their subjection. Douglas envisioned a subaltern black\ncounterpublic that might have its own distinct ideas about the optimal\nnorms of communal life and what constituted civilized behavior (see\nDawson 2011).\n\nThese new problematics in political philosophy often draw from\nneglected historical sources, including Douglass and Du Bois as well as\nMartin Delaney, Anna Julia Cooper, Simon Bolivar, Kwame Nkrumah,\nAmilcar Cabral, Walter Rodney, Haya de la Torre, Jose Mart\u00ed,\nAim\u00e9 and Suzanne Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, and many others.\nRelated to these new non-European sources has been an altered map of\nthe European sources of greatest interest, to include more of\nMontaigne, Las Casas, Condorcet, Rousseau, Gramsci, Marcuse, and\nothers.\n\nTo be sure, many Critical Philosophers of Race decline to follow\nOutlaw in believing that there is a \u2018black counterpublic\u2019\nthat represents a racially cohesive formation. To the extent there is\ncohesion, it is based more on opposition to white supremacy, some\nargue, than an expression of shared sensibilities and orientations. And\nso the debate ensues. As this entry has shown, strong differences\nabound among CPR scholars over the history of Negritude and\nmetissage, the implications of intersectionality, the meaning\nand future of racial concepts, and the weighty role of capitalism as a\ncausal factor. A newly interpreted, reorganized and expanded history of\nphilosophy is reformulating our central questions in many sub-fields,\ninvigorating new lines of argumentation, more relevant for current\nchallenges.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works cited", "Other Important Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works cited": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Al-Saji, Alia, 2013, \u201cToo Late: Racialized Time and the\nClosure of the Past,\u201d <em>Insights</em>, 6 (5): 1\u201313.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014, \u201cA Phenomenology of Hesitation:\nInterrupting Racialized Habits of Seeing\u201d in Emily S.
