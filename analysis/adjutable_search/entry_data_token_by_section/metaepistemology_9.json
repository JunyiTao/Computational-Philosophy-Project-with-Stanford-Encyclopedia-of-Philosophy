    "main_text": "Methodology in epistemology || Analyses in epistemology: semantic, conceptual and metaphysical\n3.3 Experimental epistemology\n\nA relatively recent trend in epistemology\u2014experimental\nepistemology\u2014(Beebe 2012, 2016; Beebe & Monaghan 2018;\nGerken & Beebe 2016; Turri 2016a,b, 2018; Buckwalter 2012;\nCola\u00e7o et al. 2014; Carter, Pritchard, & Shepherd 2019)\nuses the methodology of psychology, cognitive, and other sciences\n(e.g., digital humanities\u2014see Alfano, Carter, & Cheong 2018)\nto study (typically) patterns of knowledge, justification and other\nepistemic attributions. Results reported have at least two kinds of\npotential import in epistemology: first, results may be seen as\nbearing on what is or is not believed intuitively by people generally,\nand differentially on the basis of cultural and intellectual\nbackgrounds (e.g., Weinberg, Nichols, & Stich 2001; Cola\u00e7o\net al. 2014); second, and more ambitiously, such results may be taken\nto challenge or support the truth of epistemological positions that\nare generally held (Sosa 2007b: 99; see also for discussion Beebe\n2016; Knobe & Nichols 2017; Horvath & Koch 2021; Turri\n2016a).\n\nTwo notable examples where experimental results have been taken to\nstand in prima facie tension with orthodox positions in\nepistemology concern knowledge attributions in cases with (i) shifting\nstakes and (ii) unsafe beliefs. In the former case, experimental\nresults reported in early papers in experimental epistemology\nsurprisingly did not corroborate a key datum of use appealed to by\nepistemic contextualists; that is, contextualists such as Keith DeRose\n(1992, 2009) have relied on the thought that\u2014in\n\u201cbank\u201d cases (1992: 913)\u2014it is felicitous to\nattribute knowledge in low-stakes cases but not in high-stakes cases.\nCritics of contextualism had generally accepted this point about use\npatterns while challenging the reasoning from here to a contextualist\nsemantics for \u201cknows\u201d. However, early experimental\nepistemology papers by Buckwalter (2010), Feltz and Zarpentine (2010),\nand May et al. (2010) reported that participants were similarly\ninclined to attribute knowledge across cases with shifting stakes, in\nboth low- and high-stakes cases (for discussion see Knobe &\nNichols 2017: \u00a72.4).\n\nAnother kind of arguably surprising type of result from experimental\nepistemology concerns \u201cGettier cases\u201d, and in two distinct\nways: first by suggesting the Gettier \u201cintuition\u201d (viz.,\nthat the subject lacks knowledge in standard Gettier cases), is highly\nsensitive to cultural background (Weinberg, Nichols, & Stich\n2001). In particular, Weinberg et al.\u2019s (2001) study reported\nresults indicating that laypersons with East and South Asian cultural\nbackgrounds were inclined (more so than those with Western\nbackgrounds) to attribute knowledge in standard Gettier cases. This\npaper generated debate about the philosophical import of these\nresults, and led to further related studies. Perhaps most notably,\nthis includes a 2017 study by Machery et al. which presented evidence\nthat the Gettier intuition was present across four cultures speaking\ndifferent languages: Brazil, India, Japan, and the USA.\n\nRelatedly, a now well-replicated result in experimental epistemology\nconcerns laypersons\u2019 judgments in \u201cfake-barn\u201d style\nGettier cases (e.g., Ginet 1975; Goldman 1976). In fake-barn cases,\nreferred to also as \u201cenvironmental luck\u201d cases by Duncan\nPritchard (2005, 2007, 2015), the unsafety of the subject\u2019s\ntarget belief is entirely down to her being situated in an\nepistemically risky environment (e.g., an environment with near-by\nerror possibilities). Whereas a common position in mainstream\nepistemology is that a belief falls short of knowledge provided it is\nunsafe\u2014viz., if too easily the belief would\nhave been incorrect (see, e.g., Pritchard 2005, 2007; Engel 1992;\nLuper-Foy 1984; Sainsbury 1997; Greco 2010; cf, however, Sosa 2007a,\n2010; Hetherington 2013; Baumann 2014), studies in experimental\nepistemology have pressed back against this orthodoxy. For example,\nexperiments by Cola\u00e7o et al. (2014), Turri, Buckwalter, and\nBlouw (2015), and Turri (2016b) reported that participants were more\ninclined than not to attribute knowledge in fake barn cases (with a\nmajority of 80% of participants registering this view in Turri\n2016b).\n\nExperimental results in epistemology raise metaepistemological\nquestions. One such question concerns the extent to which facts about\nour patterns of using \u201cknows\u201d should inform\nepistemological theory (see\n \u00a73.2).\n Another related metaepistemological question of relevance here asks\nwhat the role of intuition is in epistemological theorizing;\nthis bears relevance to the extent that experimental results purport\nto be testing folk (and expert) intuitions about cases. A third\nmetaepistemological question experimental results in epistemology\nencourage concerns the comparative weight we should give to\nfolk judgments about cases. A well-known position on this\nquestion\u2014viz., the expertise reply\u2014(e.g.,\nWilliamson 2011; Ludwig 2007; Kauppinen 2007) maintains that\nphilosophers\u2019 judgments about cases will plausibly be more\nreliable than those of laypersons, given that the former\u2019s\ntraining would lead them to be more sensitive to nuances of the cases\nassessed, as well as to be less likely to be less susceptible to\nirrelevant distorting effects (Egler & Ross 2020: 1079). For\ncriticism of the expertise defense, see e.g., Machery (2015) and\nMizrahi (2015).\n",
