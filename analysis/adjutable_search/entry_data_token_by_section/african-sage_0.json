    "main_text": "Oruka\u2019s Project\n1. Oruka\u2019s Project\n\nThe following two examples from this text illustrate the method and\npurpose of Oruka\u2019s questioning. When asked what he thought of his own\n(Luo) community\u2019s idea of communalism, Paul Mbuya Akoko responded as\nfollows:\n\nNow the sense in which we may justly say that the Luo in the\ntraditional setting practiced communalism is not one in which people\ngenerously shared property or wealth. Their idea of communalism is, I\nthink, of a co-operative nature. For example, where one person had\ncattle, everybody \u2018ipso facto\u2019 had cattle. For the owner\nof the cattle would distribute his cattle among people who did not\nhave cattle [of their own] so that the less well-off people may take\ncare of them\u2026[but] never completely given away\u2026The\nresult is that everybody had cows to look after and so milk to drink.\n(Oruka, 1990: 141)\n\n\nAnother sage, Okemba Simiyu Chaungo from the Bukusu community,\nresponded to the question, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d as follows:\n\nWhen something is true, it is just as you see it \u2026 it is just\nwhat it is \u2026 just like this bottle \u2026 it is true that it\nis just a bottle\u2026 just what it is. Truth is good. Falsehood is\nbad. It is evil. He who says the truth is accepted by good people. A\nliar may have many followers \u2026 but he is bad.\n[Obwatieri \u2026 bwatoto. Bwatoto nokhulola\nsindu ne siene sa tu \u2026 nga inchpa yino olola ichupa ni yene sa\ntu.] (Sage Philosophy, p. 111)\n\n\nAnd in response to an Interlocutor, who asks \u201cWhy would people tell\nlies?\u201d, he responded:\n\nSo that they may eat\u2026 so that they may get empty prestige. They\nwant to profit fraudulently. (Sage Philosophy, p. 111)\n\n\nFrom these examples some of the distinguishing characteristics of Sage\nPhilosophy can be gleaned. First, they display the deeply personal\nnature of the ideas, or opinions, that the sages expressed in response\nto the questions. Akoko\u2019s insight derives from his individual\nreflections on the practice of communalism to consider its\njustification. Second, they provide evidence of abstract thought about\nphilosophic topics. Chaungo considers what it means for a proposition\nto be true and expresses what turns out to be a correspondence theory\nof truth \u2014 according to which the proposition \u201cThis is a\nbottle\u201d is true if the object it refers to, this thing, is\nindeed a bottle. By pointing out that some people choose deliberately\nto be untruthful for unjust gain he also addresses the moral aspects\nof truth.\n\nOruka\u2019s survey of sages aimed to counter three negative claims\nregarding the philosophical status of indigenous African thought:\n\nUnlike Greek sages who used reason, African sages do not engage in\nphilosophic thought.\nAfrican sages are part of an oral tradition, whereas philosophic\nthought requires literacy.\nAfrican traditions encourage unanimity regarding beliefs and\nvalues and discourage individual critical thought.\n\n\nHis reply to these claims has significantly shaped the discourse on\nSage Philosophy. In what follows the criteria he proposed to determine\nwhat counts as Sage Philosophy will be considered in the light of his\ncritique of the Eurocentric bias against African philosophic thought\nand the question of whether literacy is required.\n",
