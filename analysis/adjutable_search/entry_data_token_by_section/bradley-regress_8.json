    "main_text": "Replies to Bradleyean Arguments || Non-Relational Ties\n3.2 Non-Relational Ties\n\nA great number of philosophers have found Bradley\u2019s regress\narguments to be compelling as stated. Some, in fact, have taken the\nregress arguments to be so threatening, that they have concluded that\nonly non-relational ties might be able to unify qualities. Strawson\n(1959: 167\u2013170), for instance, has appealed to non-relational\nties such as instantial tie and characterizing tie\nto unify a particular with a sortal (such as dog) and\ncharacterizing universal (such as wisdom) respectively. He\nthought of these ties as being more intimate relators than ordinary\nrelations as well as allowing for greater heterogeneity between the\nterms they bind. Bergmann (1967: 9) famously appealed to a\nnon-relational tie he called \u201cnexus\u201d and which he\nintroduced to tie the qualities directly, without mediation. Armstrong\n(1978: 110, 1989: 109) too embraced something he called a\n\u201cnon-relational fundamental tie\u201d of instantiation.\n\nTwo objections are frequently brought against non-relational ties: (1)\nthey are found to be more obscure than full-blooded relations; and (2)\nthey are accused of not being able to stop the regress any more than\nordinary relations do. Philosophers that find relations to be\nsuspicious entities, tend to find non-relational ties even more\nsuspicious and obscure. They ask: How are non-relational ties\ndifferent from relations? If they are meant to relate or\n\u201ctie\u201d their relata, are they not sufficiently like\nrelations? And if there was a problem with Bradley\u2019s regress of\nrelations in the first place, don\u2019t we have the same problem\nwith non-relational ties? (Lewis (2002) has made similar remarks\nagainst non-relational ties in the context of discussing the problem\nof termporary intrinsics and the adverbialist reply to the problem.)\nVallicella (2000: 241) has attacked non-relational ties by arguing that\neven if the nexus manages to save Bergmann from the regress, the unity\nproblem remains. The problem, as Vallicella sees it, then becomes that\nnexus is sufficiently like a universal that it remains\nunclear what it is that unites a, Fness, and\nnexus into a state of affairs as opposed to having a mere sum\nof a+Fness+nexus.\n",
