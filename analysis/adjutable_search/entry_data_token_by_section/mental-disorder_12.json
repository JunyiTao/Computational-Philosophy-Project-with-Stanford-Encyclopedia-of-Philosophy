    "main_text": "Classification\n6. Classification\n\nWhile\n Section 3\n focused on what might separate mental from non-mental disorders, and\n Section 4\n was concerned with how to separate disordered from non-disordered\nstates, Section 6 addresses another aspect of classification:\ncontroversies over how different types of putative mental disorders\nshould be distinguished from one another. These controversies, like so\nmany about psychiatry, span the disciplines of medicine, science\n(including neuroscience and psychology) and philosophy.\n\nThe diagnostic and statistical classificatory manuals and\ninternational disease classifications (DSMs and ICDs) share broad\nfeatures in providing a categorical scheme of separate mental\ndisorders: each disorder is idiopathic in arising at least in part\nfrom morbid factors within the person, and each is identified\n\u201cdescriptively\u201d, using polythetic (disjunctive) criteria\nto be employed with clinical observation of individual patients\n(including their self-report). Aside from serving the institutions\nproviding services, their uniformity is aimed to enhance\ninter-diagnostician reliability; and research based on these reliable\nclassifications, it had been hoped, should eventually allow validation\nof the categories, although failure to achieve this promised yield in\nresearch findings has been conspicuous, and partly motivated the\nrevised research domain criteria (RDoC), described later in this\nsection.\n\nFollowing early work by Carl Hempel (1961) that depicted\npsychiatry\u2019s claim to scientific status as depending on the\nvalue neutrality of its classifications, much philosophical discussion\nof classification has been entirely critical, conceding little\nusefulness to the approach, skeptical of the promise of validity,\ndoubtful of its methodology and claims to scientific authority,\nun-persuaded by the categorical system employed, as well as its\nindividualistic and idiopathic emphasis, and dubious over its claim to\nbeing, or being able to be, value-free. Philosophical analysis has\noften been focused on particular symptom descriptions, disregarding or\ndisavowing the diagnostic categories of which they are presumed to be\nclinical manifestations, in some cases introducing and employing\nrevised categories such as \u201cdistress related conditions\u201d\n(Bolton 2012), \u201cbody image disorders\u201d(Morris 2013), and\n\u201creal hallucinations\u201d (Ratcliffe 2017). Others have\naccepted the entities so classified (Sass, Zahavi, Frith and\ncolleagues, for example).\n\nCriticisms of DSM and ICD classifications have addressed their\nresearch purposes and usefulness, categorical approaches and supposed\nvalue-neutrality. (The claim to value neutrality is discussed in\n Section 8.\n These classifications recognize the presence of many overarching\nvalues, including the methodological ones implicit in their goals of\nachieving validity and reliability. But further, unsupportable values\n(such as homophobia and misogyny) have been identified as well.)\n",
