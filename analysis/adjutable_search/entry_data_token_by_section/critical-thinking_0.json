    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\n\n\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\n\n\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\n\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\n\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\n Supplement on Assessment.\n Educational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\n\nFor details on this history, see the\n Supplement on History.\n",
