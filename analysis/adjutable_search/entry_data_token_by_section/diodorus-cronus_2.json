    "main_text": "Semantics\n3. Semantics\n\n\nThe classic Sorites, or \u2018heap argument\u2019, seeks to show\nthat even 10,000 grains do not make a heap, on the ground that (a)\nthree grains do not, and (b) the addition of one grain could never be\nenough to turn a non-heap into a heap: however often a further grain is\nadded, no precise boundary between non-heap and heap is ever found.\nApplications of this argument form were widespread in the Hellenistic\nage, and the Stoic logician Chrysippus wrote many books trying to solve\nit. Diodorus is a likely source or inspiration for this Hellenistic\npreoccupation (see previous paragraph).\n\n\nThe Sorites is a particularly lethal weapon when used in the field\nof semantics, threatening to erase the boundaries on which rigid\ndefinitions depend. It may be relevant, then, that Diodorus is reported\nto have propounded a semantic theory of his own (Aulus Gellius,\nAttic nights 11.12.1\u20133; cf. 1 above, the story of his\nrenaming his slave, reported by Ammonius, On Aristotle\u2019s De\ninterpretatione 38.17\u201320). This was based on the\n\u2018conventionalist\u2019 thesis expressed by the character\nHermogenes in Plato\u2019s Cratylus, according to whom nothing but\nconvention\u2014whether national, local or simply\nprivate\u2014determines the meaning of a word, and any convenient\nstring of sounds can in principle be used to convey any meaning.\nDiodorus\u2019s inference from this was that the sole determinant of any\nword\u2019s meaning is the intention of the utterer on any given occasion\non which it is used. He went on to infer that there are no actual\nambiguities: given the assumption that a word is on each occasion\nuttered with one specific meaning in mind, a word has only one meaning\nat any time.\n\n\nOne may wonder whether this semantic theory, which reduced meaning to\nutterer\u2019s meaning, was designed to remedy the kind of damage\nthat the Sorites threatened. If meanings are determined purely by the\nutterer\u2019s intention on each occasion, a radical reconsideration\nof definitional theory seems in any event to be called for. And it may\nbe that counting the grains becomes simply irrelevant to the\ndetermination of what constitutes a heap.\n\nDiodorus was also closely associated with the \u2018Veiled\u2019\nparadox (Diogenes Laertius, 2.111; Lucian, Sale of lives,\n22\u20133): you know who your father is; you don\u2019t know who the\nveiled man over there is; but that veiled man is your father;\nso you both do and do not know who your father is. We might conjecture\nDiodorus\u2019 own solution to have been once again a semantic\none. At each of its occurrences \u2018know\u2019 has, in the\nrespondent\u2019s mind, a distinct meaning appropriate to the case\n(acquaintance, recognition), and hence no contradiction is\ninvolved.\n",
