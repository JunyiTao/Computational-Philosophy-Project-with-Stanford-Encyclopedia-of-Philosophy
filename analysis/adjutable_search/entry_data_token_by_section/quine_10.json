    "main_text": "Quinean Epistemology || Observation Sentences\n4.2 Observation Sentences\n\nCentral to Quine\u2019s naturalistic account of knowledge is the idea\nthat all our knowledge is in some way based upon stimulations of our\nsensory nerves. For much of our knowledge, the relation is quite\nindirect. (This is one way of expressing holism; see 3.1, above.) Most\nsentences are not accepted because of a direct relation between the\ngiven sentence and stimulations of nerve endings; the connection goes\nvia other sentences, and may be quite indirect and remote. But then\nthere must presumably be some sentences which are directly related to\nstimulations. This is the role that observation sentences play in\nQuine\u2019s thought. Acts of uttering such sentences, or of\nassenting to them when they are uttered by others, are shared\nresponses to stimulation. (We shall enter some qualifications at the\nend of this sub-section.)\n\nObservation sentences are the starting point for our acquisition of\nknowledge, the child\u2019s entry into cognitive language. They are\nalso the sentences which are evidentially basic. What fits them to\nplay both roles is that they are (largely) independent of other parts\nof our language. Hence they can (largely) be mastered by a child\notherwise without linguistic competence, and known without\npresupposing other parts of our theory. (The reason for the\nqualification will become apparent at the end of this\nsub-section.)\n\nMany philosophers are content to take for granted the idea of an\nevidentially basic sentence. Quine, however, cannot take that\nattitude; he needs to show how we get \u201cfrom stimulus to\nscience\u201d. The first step is to show that we can give a purely\nnaturalistic account of how some linguistic utterances can be directly\ntied to the occurrence of stimulations of the sensory nerves---an\naccount of observation sentences, more or less. Quine expends enormous\nlabour on this point.\n\nQuine considers acts of assenting to sentences (or dissenting; but we\nshall mostly leave that as understood). He focuses, in particular, on\nour dispositions to assent to sentences. (We will briefly\nconsider the idea of a disposition in the next section.) To be an\nobservation sentence, a sentence must fulfill two criteria, one\nindividualistic and one social. The individualistic criterion is that\na sentence is an observation sentence for a given person if he or she\nis disposed to assent to it when, and only when, he or she is\nundergoing appropriate sensory stimulations, regardless of her\ninternal state (e.g. the ancillary information which he or she\npossesses). \u201cIt\u2019s warm in here\u201d presumably satisfies\nthis criterion; my willingness to assent to it perhaps depends only on\nwhich of my sensory nerves are stimulated at the given moment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s milk in the refrigerator\u201d presumably does\nnot; unless I am actually looking into the refrigerator at the time,\nmy willingness to assent to it depends not on what I am experiencing\nat the time but on my internal state, what I remember. The social\ncriterion is that the individualistic criterion should hold across the\nlinguistic community as a whole. To specify this more precisely is\ntricky, and we shall postpone the matter for a few paragraphs.\n\nEven the individualistic criterion raises considerable complications\nand difficulties. We speak of a disposition to assent (or dissent) in\nresponse to a pattern of stimulation but this is not quite accurate.\nSuch a pattern, a complete list of which sensory nerves are firing,\nand in which order, will hardly ever repeat itself. So what we need\nis, rather, the idea of a correlation of a response with a\ntype of stimulation\n pattern.[1]\n But the relevant idea of a type here is complicated. The physical\nresemblance of two stimulation patterns, what Quine calls\nreceptual similarity, is not enough to make them\nconstitute events of the same type, in the relevant sense; two such\npatterns may resemble each other very closely yet lead to quite\ndifferent responses. (Two occasions on which I am driving a car may be\nalmost identical in terms of my stimulation patterns, except that on\none occasion I see a red light and on the other I see a green light.\nAs far as my response goes, that small difference outweighs all the\nsimilarities.) What is wanted is a more complex notion which Quine\ncalls perceptual similarity. Very roughly, two stimulation\npatterns count as similar (for an animal, at a time) if they tend to\nlead to the same\n response.[2]\n\nWith the account of perceptual similarity in place, we can say what it\nis for a sentence to be observational for me: if I am disposed to\nassent to it on one occasion on which I have a certain neural intake,\nthen I will also be disposed to assent to it on any other occasion on\nwhich I have neural intake which is (sufficiently) perceptually\nsimilar for me at that time.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the fact that the definition of the key notion\nof perceptual similarity is behavioural. It avoids any idea of\nexperience, of awareness, of what strikes the person (or other animal)\nas more similar to what. It is simply a matter of responses, and thus\nof behaviour. (Assent is also treated as behavior, as sound-making\npropensities; see 1975c pp. 87\u201388). This is in accord with\nQuine\u2019s insistence on what he takes to be scientific standards\nof clarity and rigour. One consequence of it is that the notion cannot\nbe invoked to explain behaviour. Quine is under no illusions\non this score. (See 1975c, 87, where the point is explicit.) The\nbehavioural account does not explain our understanding of\nobservation sentences; explanation, if possible at all, comes at the\nneuro-physiological level. What the behavioural account does is to\nmake clear exactly what behaviour constitutes that understanding and,\nhence, what the neuro-physiological account would have to explain. (It\nalso shows that there is indeed something to be explained.)\n\nSo far we have only an account of what it is for a sentence to be an\nobservation sentence for a particular person. But our language is\nshared, as it must be if it is to enable us to communicate with one\nanother. So we need to generalize the criterion across the linguistic\ncommunity. One might at first think that the social criterion would\nbe: if one person is disposed to assent to the sentence on any\noccasion on which he or she has a certain neural intake, then any\nother person having the same neural intake will also be disposed to\nassent to it. Quine gives essentially this account in (1960). As he\nquickly comes to see, however, it is not tenable, for it assumes that\nwe can make sense of the idea of \u201csame neural intake\u201d\nbetween different people. But different people have different sensory\nnerves (and there is no reason to suppose that one person\u2019s\nsensory nerves are homologous to those of others; see Quine 1969,\nchapter 6).\n\nQuine returned to this problem on and off over the next thirty-five\nyears. His eventual solution is that a sentence only counts as an\nobservation sentence if an occasion which leads to my having neural\nintake which disposes me to assent to it also leads to your having\nneural intake which disposes you to assent to it. Here there is no\ncross-person identification of neural intake or cross-person standards\nof perceptual similarity. On this account, however, there can only be\nobservation sentences if our standards of perceptual similarity line\nup in the right way. Two occasions which produce in me neural intakes\nwhich are perceptually similar by my standards must also (often\nenough) produce in you neural intakes which are perceptually similar\nby your standards. Quine is happy enough with this assumption of\nmutual attunement and suggests that it can be explained along\nevolutionary lines (see 1996, 160f., and for the whole story, Kemp\n2022, 805\u2013810).\n\nWe have been explaining the idea of our having shared responses to\nstimulation. For the most part, Quine assumes that assent to an\nobservation sentence simply is such a response. This assumption,\nhowever, cannot be quite correct. It may look for all the world as if\nthere were a rabbit in front of me, even though there is not. If I\nhave no reason to be suspicious I will be disposed to assent to\n\u201cRabbit?\u201d; if I know about the deception, however, I will\nnot be. So my disposition to assent does not, after all, depend solely\non my sensory stimulations at the time. It depends also on my internal\nstate, whether I know that in this case the rabbit-like appearance is\nmisleading. The difficulty arises because \u201cThere\u2019s a\nrabbit\u201d is corrigible, a feature which, on most accounts, it\nshares with just about every sentence other than those about the\nspeaker\u2019s current experience. If a sentence is corrigible then\nthere will be circumstances in which it is false, even though those\ncircumstances produce stimulation patterns which would generally lead\nobservers to assent to it. But then some observers may know that the\ncircumstances are of this deceptive kind and not be disposed to\nassent, while others have no such knowledge and are disposed to\nassent. The moral of this is that assent, even to observation\nsentences, is not a mere response to stimulation; the\nresponder\u2019s internal state (having ancillary knowledge, or not)\nmay also play a role.\n\nQuine does not seem to have fully appreciated this point, though some\nof his later discussions come close to doing so (see, in particular,\nQuine 1996). It is not fatal to his general account; it complicates\nthe story rather than requiring a radical change. There may be no\nsentences\u2014at least none that satisfy the social criterion for\nobservationality\u2014which can be wholly mastered simply by\nacquiring appropriate dispositions to assent and dissent in response\nto current stimulations. For some sentences, however, acquiring such\ndispositions comes close to mastering their use, because those\nsentences are almost always true in those cases where\nobservers receive sensory stimulations which dispose them to assent.\n(Clearly this will be a matter of degree.) So the acquisition of the\nrelevant dispositions, and partial mastery of the sentence, can be\nused as a basis on which the child can learn more of the language, and\nmore about the world. This further learning in turn allows the child\nto modify her or his original disposition to assent and dissent merely\nin response to current stimulation.\n",
