The strong\nfeelings and devotion often associated with loyalty have led some to\nassert that loyalty is only or primarily a feeling or\nsentiment\u2014an affective bondedness that may express itself in\ndeeds, the latter more as an epiphenomenon than as its core. As Ewin\nput it, loyalty is an \u201cinstinct to sociability\u201d (Ewin,\n1990, 4; cf. Connor, 2007). But feelings of loyalty are probably not\nconstitutive of loyalty, even if it is unusual to find loyalties that\nare affectless. Arguably, the test of loyalty is conduct rather than\nintensity of feeling, primarily a certain \u201cstickingness\u201d\nor perseverance\u2014the loyal person acts for or stays with or\nremains committed to the object of loyalty even when it is likely to\nbe disadvantageous or costly to the loyal person to remain so.\n\nThose who focus on loyalty as a sentiment often intend to deny that\nloyalty might be rationally motivated. But even though expressions of\nloyalty may not be maximizing (in cost-benefit terms), the decision to\ncommit oneself loyally may be rational, for one need not (indeed,\nought not to) enter into associations blindly, or\u2014even when they\nare initially unavoidable (as with familial or national\nones)\u2014accept their demands unthinkingly. Moreover, once made,\nsuch commitments may be forfeited by the objects of loyalty should\nthere be serious failure on their part, or they may be overridden in\nthe face of significantly greater claims. One loyalty may trump\nanother; other values may trump loyalty.\n\nUnsentimental loyalties, such as the zealous but unsentimental\nprofessional loyalty of a lawyer to a client, are not unthinking, but\nhave their rationale in professional or associational tele,\nsuch as that of the adversarial system (however, see McChrystal, 1992,\n1998). It is to this shared professional commitment that the lawyer is\nultimately committed, not as a matter of mere sentiment but of\ndeliberative choice.\n\nPosing the issue as one of either \u201cpractical disposition\u201d\nor \u201csentiment\u201d is probably too stark. Some evolutionary\nbiologists/psychologists see loyalty as a genetically transmitted\nadaptive mechanism, a felt attachment to others that has survival\nvalue (Wilson, 1993, 23). Given what is often seen as the\nself-sacrificial character of individual loyalty, such loyalty is\ntaken to be directed primarily to group survival (West, 1945, 218).\nBut it is not clear what any such explanatory account shows. What\n\u201cloyalty\u201d may have begun as (defense of the group against\nthreat) and what it has come to be for reflective beings need not be\nthe same. Nor would it impugn what loyalty has come to be that it\nbegan as a survival mechanism (presuming an adaptive account to be\ncorrect).\n",
