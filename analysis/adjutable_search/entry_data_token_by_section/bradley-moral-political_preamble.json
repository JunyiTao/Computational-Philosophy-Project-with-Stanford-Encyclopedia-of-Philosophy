    "main_text": "\nThe ethical writings of the Oxford Idealists, T. H. Green and\nF. H. Bradley, reflect the influence of Kant and Hegel on English\nmoral philosophy in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century.  To the\nextent that either draws on other sources it is to Aristotle that they\nturn rather than to British moral philosophers such as Butler, Hume or\nReid; a point which is evident both from the fact that Green and\nBradley offer a type of perfectionist account of morality that is\narticulated in terms of the concept of self-realization and from the\nappearance of Aristotle\u2019s man of practical wisdom (the\nphronimos) in the fifth essay of Bradley\u2019s Ethical\nStudies.  In addition, much of their attention was taken up with\ncritical analyses of utilitarianism - the dominant ethical theory of\nthe day - and the hedonism to which it was wedded, whether that view\nadvanced the primacy of pleasure either in the form of a psychological\naccount of motivation or as the felt state that right actions aim at\nmaximizing.  Indeed, Bradley not only had to dispense with the claims\nof the older utilitarians, such as Bentham and Mill, but also had to\nface the new defense of utilitarianism advanced by Henry Sidgwick, who\npublished his The Methods of Ethics (1874) virtually\nsimultaneously with Bradley\u2019s Ethical Studies (1876).  For a\ngreater part of the Twentieth century Bradley\u2019s critical attacks on\nhedonism and utilitarianism were considered to be about the best part\nof his book.  During this same period it was also usual to read Essay\nV (\u201cMy Station and Its Duties\u201d) as expressing Bradley\u2019s own position,\nand this was interpreted as derivative, relying heavily on Hegel\u2019s\nview of society as an organism of interrelated persons.  It is later\nrealized, largely because of Peter Nicholson\u2019s studies of the moral\nand political philosophy of the British Idealists, that taking the\nperspective of \u201cMy Station\u201d as final misses the relevance of the next\nessay, entitled \u201cIdeal Morality,\u201d in the dialectical progress of\nBradley\u2019s essays.\nWhile this reminder about the importance of the later essays guards\nagainst a serious misreading of the arguments of Ethical\nStudies, it invites a different error by suggesting that Bradley\nis attempting to identify the supreme moral principle that should\nguide human choices and actions. Now, for Sidgwick that is the\nwhole point of moral philosophy and he criticizes Green\u2019s claim that\nthe end of action is self-realization on the grounds that this notion\nis simply too general and vague to be practically useful in informing\nus about what we should do in any given circumstance; and because of\nthis indeterminacy Sidgwick rejects it as a possible expression of the\nsupreme moral end.  (Of course, a plurality of irreducible ultimate\nprinciples also leaves us with no clear direction and his finding two\nsuch principles is what leads to the failure of Sidgwick\u2019s own\ntheory.)  By contrast, it is crucial to recognize that Bradley is not\nengaged in, or much interested in, this sort of enterprise. Rather, he\nwants to understand the moral perspective and the nature of moral\nagents and also to uncover the logical structure of deliberation and\nchoice.\nEthical Studies was Bradley\u2019s only book on moral\nphilosophy, published when he was very young, in 1876. Organized\naround the concept of self-realization, it presents a metaphysical\nethics in the sense that it is largely concerned with coming to\nunderstand the moral agent, which entails laying bare the structure of\nvolitional choice. In this respect, Bradley offers a theory of\npractical reasoning.  The overarching end of practical reasoning is\nself-realization and so it is no surprise that Bradley thinks the main\nobjective of moral action is to become as morally good as we can,\nmaking the world morally better in the process.  This perfectionist\ntheory is developed and defended not in terms of the moral virtues and\ntheir contribution to the good life, but on the ground that the\nrealization of the self is a necessary feature of the logical\nstructure of intentionally willed moral actions.\n The basic data for analysis of moral action come from observing\nthe practical judgments ordinary people make and their understanding\nand use of normative concepts. The role of the philosopher is to\nexplain this moral world rather than to generate principles dictating\nhow people should act. In this respect, Bradley offers a descriptive\nrather than a prescriptive ethical theory. Yet, he holds it equally\nimportant to learn how a child develops from a creature with appetites\nand needs into a mature, reflective moral agent capable of complex\ndeliberations and choices. Answering this question requires a\npsychological theory of moral development which explains why\nindividuals pursue the specific goals they do. In this respect\nEthical Studies has something of the flavor of a naturalized\nethics. Bradley claims that proving that the ultimate end of action is\nself-realization would require establishing the nature of the self, of\nreality and the process of realization, which would amount to having a\ndeveloped system of metaphysics, and that, lacking this, the best he\ncan do is to explain the thesis and try to make it plausible\n(Ethical Studies, p. 65). The reader should not be fooled by\nthis. Metaphysics was always Bradley\u2019s primary philosophical interest\nand his moral theory is shaped by his metaphysical views, some of\nwhich are already discernable in Ethical Studies. The lament\nthat he does not have a fully developed view, which is common in his\nwritings, merely reflects his feeling that there is always more to be\nsaid - at least until a fully developed metaphysical treatise reveals\nReality to us.\n",
