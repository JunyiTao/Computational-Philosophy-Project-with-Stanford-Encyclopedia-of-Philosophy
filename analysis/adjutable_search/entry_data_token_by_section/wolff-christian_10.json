    "main_text": "Practical Philosophy\n7. Other Philosophical Contributions\n\nWolff\u2019s prominence in eighteenth-century Germany, and his\nwide-ranging interests, have meant that he is an important figure in\nthe history of a number of established fields in the eighteenth\ncentury, including mathematics, physics, political theory, and even\neconomics. Wolff also made notable, even pioneering contributions to\ndisciplines that were not as yet recognized as distinct areas of\nphilosophical inquiry. Wolff had, for instance, an early interest in\nthe philosophy of language, having devoted a dissertation to the topic\nin 1703 (Disquisitio philosophica de loquela), an interest he\ncontinued to pursue in subsequent discussions in his logical writings,\nrelating to semiotics and hermeneutics, and in his psychological\ntexts, concerning the relation between mental and linguistic entities\n(see Favaretti Camposampiero 2018 for details). Wolff is also widely\nrecognized as a founding figure in the discipline of\naesthetics\u2014while his only text devoted to the topic is a\ntreatise on civil architecture (a volume in a mathematical textbook),\nWolff\u2019s account of aesthetic pleasure in terms of the intuitive\ncognition of perfection (EP: \u00a7511), and identification of that\nperfection as consisting in a unity in multiplicity, were taken up and\ndiscussed by later aesthetic theorists, including A. G. Baumgarten\n(the father of modern aesthetics), J. C. Gottsched, J. G. Sulzer\n(1720\u201379), and Mendelssohn (see Beiser 2009; Buchenau 2013).\n",
