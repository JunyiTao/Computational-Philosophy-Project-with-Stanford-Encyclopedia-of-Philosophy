    "main_text": "Biomedicine as an Institution\n4. Biomedicine as an Institution\n\nThe disputes over biomedicine\u2019s virtues and flaws are tied to\nthe other aspects of Western cultural-political-economic influence\nthat coevolved with it, and travelled with it around the globe. The\ndynamics between the institution of biomedicine\u2014rooted in\nwealthy Western countries\u2014and low/middle-income countries is in\npart a manifestation of the philosophical complexities of the\ninternational political scene. See, for instance, the literature on\n International Distributive Justice.\n\nAs discussed in\n Section 1.2,\n biomedicine co-evolved with the West\u2019s social and economic\ninstitutions in the aftermath of World War Two. Of particular\nimportance, the individualism of Western capitalism has meshed with\nbiomedicine\u2019s ontological view of the body as effectively\nseparable from its social context. Briggs and Hallin describe the how\ncontemporary media and biomedicine work to coproduce public knowledge\nabout health and disease, a process they dub biomediatization (Briggs\n& Hallin 2016).\n\nMetzl and Kirkland\u2019s influential edited volume Against\nHealth: How Health Became the New Morality lays out a\nrelated case for how biomedicine exercised undue influence over\nculture, including casting health ills as personal failings deserving\nof public shaming and stigmatization (Metzl & Kirkland 2010). As\nan illustration of the sort of stigmatizing strategies that they\ncondemn as unacceptable, bioethicist Daniel Callahan ethically\nendorsed the social practice of \u2018fat shaming\u2019 as a means\nof promoting public health (Callahan 2016). Empirical arguments on the\nharms of stigmatization (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link 2013), and\ncontrary ethical arguments (Dean 2018), both rebut stigma as an\nethically viable health-promoting intervention.\n\nHealth/body stigma, public rhetoric over health, and moralism about\nhealth behaviors are all subjected to scrutiny in critiques of\n\u2018self-care\u2019 strategies, e.g., telling\n\u2018overweight\u2019/overtired/overworked employees feeling\nstressed by their jobs that they should take better care of themselves\nby doing yoga, more closely monitoring their eating at work, etc. The\ncritique is that the biomedical model can recast social problems\n(including outright abuses\u2014usually capitalist ones) as\nindividual responsibilities. Self-care can go well when it empowers,\nsuch as the Women\u2019s Health Movement of the 1960s and 1970s that\nfought against sexism by calling upon women to know their own bodies\nand value that knowledge (Bueter 2017). Or self-care can become\nregressive when it becomes \n\n\ninner-directed, authoritarian, victim-blaming, manipulated by dominant\nforces, or diversionary from struggles for radical change in both\nmedicine and the broader society. (Sidel & Sidel 1981: 656) \n\n\nIn recent discourse, in which the problem of stress has garnered\nincreased attention, \n\n\ncontrolling the health problems associated with living in stressful\nsituations therefore becomes the responsibility of the\nindividuals\u2014all too often, the responsibility of individuals who\nare already disadvantaged by their economic status, their race, or\ntheir social position more generally. (Kaplan 2019: 116) \n\n\nBiomedicine has been used as one prong of colonial power dynamics\nbetween Western institutions and non-Western peoples (including\nindigenous peoples) (see Millum & Emanuel 2012). Colonial\ngovernments and cultural imperialism have long undermined or directly\nattacked local/indigenous medical frameworks and institutions. And\nsince biomedical education and practice are based on technologies and\neducation from the West, low- and middle-income countries are left\ndependent on wealthy Western countries (Nunn 2009). As a result, local\nwould-be biomedical practitioners often travel to the West for\nbiomedical education and then have little incentive to return to their\nhome countries to practice techniques for which they will have\nrelatively few biomedical tools, lower pay, etc. This raises further\nethical questions related to which entities have which\nindividual/collective responsibilities to address this so-called\n\u2018brain drain\u2019 trend (Yuksekdag forthcoming). Meanwhile,\nnon-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross offer medical\naid, but generally in the form of sending temporary trained personnel\nfrom the West, rather than building local capacity for medical\ntraining and practice. And well-meaning Western biomedical students\ntravel to the same low- and middle-income countries, with limited\nbiomedical skills and little or no knowledge of the populations or\nhealth needs, seeking to help populations assumed to be incapable of\nhelping themselves (Pinto & Upshur 2009).\n",
