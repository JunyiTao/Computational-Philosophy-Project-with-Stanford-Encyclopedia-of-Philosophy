Thematic Exposition of Levinas\u2019 Philosophy\n\nThis entry will follow Levinas\u2019 career chronologically, as his\nconcepts evolve. In what follows, we will emphasize the following\narguments and themes: (1) why Levinas\u2019 is a unique first\nphilosophy; (2) how he developed his investigation of the lived\nconditions of possibility of our concern with ethical reasoning; and\n(3) the originality of his adaptation of phenomenology and his\nexistentialist hermeneutics of pre-intentional embodied\nintersubjectivity. In this entry, attention is focused throughout to\nthe contribution of commentators, with a view to providing a gateway\nto recent secondary literature.\n",
