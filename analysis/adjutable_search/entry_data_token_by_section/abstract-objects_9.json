    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || The Way of Abstraction Principles\n3.4 The Way of Abstraction Principles\n\nIn the contemporary philosophical literature, a number of books and\npapers have investigated a form of abstraction that doesn\u2019t\ndepend on mental processes. We may call this the way of\nabstraction principles. Wright (1983) and Hale (1987) have\ndeveloped an account of abstract objects on the basis of an idea they\ntrace back to certain suggestive remarks in Frege (1884). Frege notes\n(in effect) that many of the singular terms that appear to refer to\nabstract entities are formed by means of functional expressions. We\nspeak of the shape of a building, the direction of a\nline, the number of books on the shelf. Of course, many\nsingular terms formed by means of functional expressions denote\nordinary concrete objects: \u2018the father of Plato\u2019,\n\u2018the capital of France\u2019. But the functional terms that\npick out abstract entities are distinctive in the following respect:\nwhere \\(f(a)\\) is such an expression, there is typically an equation\nof the form:\n\n\\[\nf(a)\\! =\\! f(b) \\text{ if and only if } Rab\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation, i.e., a relation that is\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive, relative to some domain. For\nexample:\n\nThe direction of \\(a\\) = the direction of \\(b\\) if and only if \\(a\\)\nis parallel to \\(b\\)\n\nThe number of \\(F\\text{s}\\) = the number of \\(G\\text{s}\\) if and only\nif there are just as many \\(F\\text{s}\\) as \\(G\\text{s}\\)\n\nThese biconditionals (or abstraction principles) appear to\nhave a special semantic status. While they are not strictly speaking\ndefinitions of the functional expression that occurs on the\nleft hand side, they would appear to hold in virtue of the meaning of\nthat expression. To understand the term \u2018direction\u2019 is (in\npart) to know that the direction of \\(a\\) and the direction of \\(b\\)\nare the same entity if and only if the lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are\nparallel. Moreover, the equivalence relation that appears on the right\nhand side of the biconditional would appear to be semantically and\nperhaps epistemologically prior to the functional expressions on the\nleft (Noonan 1978). Mastery of the concept of a direction presupposes\nmastery of the concept of parallelism, but not vice versa.\n\nThe availability of abstraction principles meeting these conditions\nmay be exploited to yield an account of the distinction between\nabstract and concrete objects. When \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 is a\nfunctional expression governed by an abstraction principle, there will\nbe a corresponding kind \\(K_{f}\\) such that:\n\n\\(x\\) is a \\(K_{f}\\) if and only if, for some \\(y\\), \\(x\\! =\\!\nf(y)\\).\n\nFor example,\n\n\\(x\\) is a cardinal number if and only if for some concept \\(F\\),\n\\(x\\) = the number of \\(F\\text{s}\\).\n\nThe simplest version of the way of abstraction principles is\nthen to say that:\n\n\\(x\\) is an abstract object if (and only if) \\(x\\) is an instance of\nsome kind \\(K_{f}\\) whose associated functional expression\n\u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 is governed by a suitable abstraction\nprinciple.\n\nThe strong version of this account\u2014which purports to identify a\nnecessary condition for abstractness\u2014is seriously at odds with\nstandard usage. Pure sets are usually considered paradigmatic abstract\nobjects. But it is not clear that they satisfy the proposed criterion.\nAccording to a version of na\u00efve set theory, the functional\nexpression \u2018set of\u2019 is indeed characterized by a\nputative abstraction principle.\n\nThe set of \\(F\\text{s}\\) = the set of \\(G\\text{s}\\) if and only if,\nfor all \\(x\\), \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is \\(G\\).\n\nBut this principle, which is a version of Frege\u2019s Basic Law V,\nis inconsistent and so fails to characterize an interesting concept.\nIn contemporary mathematics, the concept of a set is not introduced by\nan abstraction principle, but rather axiomatically. Though attempts\nhave been made to investigate abstraction principles for sets (Cook\n2003), it remains an open question whether something like the\nmathematical concept of a set can be characterized by a suitably\nrestricted abstraction principle. (See Burgess 2005 for a survey of\nrecent efforts in this direction.) Even if such a principle is\navailable, however, it is unlikely that the epistemological priority\ncondition will be satisfied. That is, it is unlikely that mastery of\nthe concept of set will presuppose mastery of the equivalence relation\nthat figures on the right hand side. It is therefore uncertain whether\nthe way of abstraction principles will classify the objects\nof pure set theory as abstract entities (as it presumably must).\n\nOn the other hand, as Dummett (1973) has noted, in many cases the\nstandard names for paradigmatically abstract objects do not assume the\nfunctional form to which the definition adverts. Chess is an abstract\nentity, but we do not understand the word \u2018chess\u2019 as\nsynonymous with an expression of the form \u2018\\(f(x)\\)\u2019,\nwhere \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 is governed by an abstraction principle.\nSimilar remarks would seem to apply to such things as the English\nlanguage, social justice, architecture, and Charlie Parker\u2019s\nmusical style. If so, the abstractionist approach does not provide a\nnecessary condition for abstractness as that notion is standardly\nunderstood.\n\nMore importantly, there is some reason to believe that it fails to\nsupply a sufficient condition. A mereological fusion of\nconcrete objects is itself a concrete object. But the concept of a\nmereological fusion is governed by what appears to be an abstraction\nprinciple:\n\nThe fusion of the \\(F\\text{s}\\) = the fusion of the \\(G\\text{s}\\) if\nand only if the \\(F\\text{s}\\) and \\(G\\text{s}\\) cover one\nanother,\n\nwhere the \\(F\\text{s}\\) cover the \\(G\\text{s}\\) if and only\nif every part of every \\(G\\) has a part in common with an \\(F\\).\nSimilarly, suppose a train is a maximal string of railroad carriages,\nall of which are connected to one another. We may define a functional\nexpression, \u2018the train of \\(x\\)\u2019, by means of an\n\u2018abstraction\u2019 principle: The train of \\(x\\) = the train of\n\\(y\\) if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are connected carriages. We may\nthen say that \\(x\\) is a train if and only if for some carriage \\(y\\),\n\\(x\\) is the train of \\(y\\). The simple account thus yields the\nconsequence that trains are to be reckoned abstract entities.\n\nIt is unclear whether these objections apply to the more sophisticated\nabstractionist proposals of Wright and Hale, but one feature of the\nsimple account sketched above clearly does apply to these proposals\nand may serve as the basis for an objection to this version of the\nway of abstraction principles. The neo-Fregean approach seeks\nto explain the abstract/concrete distinction in semantic\nterms: We said that an abstract object is an object that falls in the\nrange of a functional expression governed by an abstraction principle,\nwhere \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 is governed by an abstraction\nprinciple when that principle holds in virtue of the meaning\nof \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019. This notion of a statement\u2019s holding in\nvirtue of the meaning of a word is notoriously problematic (see the\nentry\n the analytic/synthetic distinction).\n But even if this notion makes sense, one may still complain: The\nabstract/concrete distinction is supposed to be a metaphysical\ndistinction; abstract objects are supposed to differ from concrete\nobjects in some important ontological respect. It should be possible,\nthen, to draw the distinction directly in metaphysical terms: to say\nwhat it is in the objects themselves that makes some things\nabstract and others concrete. As Lewis writes, in response to a\nrelated proposal by Dummett:\n\n\nEven if this \u2026 way succeeds in drawing a border, as for all I know\nit may, it tells us nothing about how the entities on opposite sides\nof that border differ in their nature. It is like saying that snakes\nare the animals that we instinctively most fear\u2014maybe so, but it\ntells us nothing about the nature of snakes. (Lewis 1986a: 82)\n\n\nThe challenge is to produce a non-semantic version of the\nabstractionist criterion that specifies directly, in metaphysical\nterms, what the objects whose canonical names are governed by\nabstraction principles all have in common.\n\nOne response to this difficulty is to transpose the abstractionist\nproposal into a more metaphysical key (see Rosen & Yablo\n2020). The idea is that each Fregean number is, by its very\nnature, the number of some Fregean concept, just as each Fregean\ndirection is, by its very nature, at least potentially the\ndirection of some concrete line. In each case, the abstract object is\nessentially the value of an abstraction function for a\ncertain class of arguments. This is not a claim about the meanings of\nlinguistic expressions. It is a claim about the essences or natures of\nthe objects themselves. (For the relevant notion of essence, see Fine\n1994.) So for example, the Fregean number two (if there is such a\nthing) is, essentially, by its very nature, the number that belongs to\na concept \\(F\\) if and only if there are exactly two \\(F\\text{s}\\).\nMore generally, for each Fregean abstract object \\(x\\), there is an\nabstraction function \\(f\\), such that \\(x\\) is essentially the value\nof \\(f\\) for every argument of a certain kind.\n\nAbstraction functions have two key features. First, for each\nabstraction function \\(f\\) there is an equivalence relation \\(R\\) such\nthat it lies in the nature of \\(f\\) that \\(f(x)\\! =\\! f(y)\\) iff\n\\(Rxy\\). Intuitively, we are to think that \\(R\\) is metaphysically\nprior to \\(f\\), and that the abstraction function \\(f\\) is\ndefined (in whole or in part) by this biconditional. Second,\neach abstraction function is a generating function: its\nvalues are essentially values of that function. Many functions are not\ngenerating functions. Paris is the capital of France, but it is not\nessentially a capital. The number of solar planets, by contrast, is\nessentially a number. The notion of an abstraction function may be\ndefined in terms of these two features:\n\n\\(f\\) is an abstraction function if and only if\n\n\n\nfor some equivalence relation \\(R\\), it lies in the nature of \\(f\\)\nthat \\(f(x)\\! =\\! f(y)\\) if and only if \\(Rxy\\); and\n\nfor all \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is a value of \\(f\\), then it lies in the\nnature of \\(x\\) that there is (or could be) some object \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(x\\! =\\! f(y)\\).\n\n\n\nWe may then say that:\n\n\\(x\\) is an abstraction if and only if, for some abstraction\nfunction \\(f\\), there is or could be an object \\(y\\) such that \\(x\\!\n=\\! f(y)\\),\n\nand that:\n\n\\(x\\) is an abstract object if (and only if) \\(x\\) is an\nabstraction.\n\nThis account tells us a great deal about the distinctive natures of\nthese broadly Fregean abstract objects. It tells us that each is, by\nits very nature, the value of a special sort of function, one whose\nnature is specified in a simple way in terms of an associated\nequivalence relation. It is worth stressing, however, that it does not\nsupply much metaphysical information about these items. It\ndoesn\u2019t tell us whether they are located in space, whether they\ncan stand in causal relations, and so on. It is an open question\nwhether this somewhat unfamiliar version of the abstract/concrete\ndistinction lines up with any of the more conventional ways of drawing\nthe distinction outlined above. An account along these lines would be\nat odds with standard usage, but may be philosophically interesting\nall the same. In any case, the problem remains that this metaphysical\nversion of the way of abstraction principles leaves out\nparadigmatic cases of abstract objects such as the aforementioned game\nof chess.\n",
