    "main_text": "\n\nIn the 1990s philosophers, in particular bioethicists, debated the\nbroad question of the justice of health care resource allocation, and\nin particular the ethical pros and cons of the dominant rationing\nstrategy based on cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) with benefit\ncharacterized in terms of \u201cquality of life\u201d. A dominant\ntheme in this literature was whether a pre-existing health state, or\nresulting health outcome, should be taken into account when allocating\nhealth resources. More specifically, the debate centered on whether a\nperson\u2019s disability should be taken into account, or whether\ndoing so would be discriminatory or unfair. As Dan Brock explained it,\nthis concern was raised because of the confluence of two\nevents\u2014the then recent (1990) passage of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA), prohibiting discrimination on the basis\nof disability, and the 1992 Oregon Medicaid proposal for rationing\nservices, which used both CEA and a quality of life outcome measure to\nprioritize treatments for persons with specific health conditions and\nwhich arguably systematically disadvantaged people with pre-existing\ndisabilities (Brock 1995, 1999, 2004).\n\nThe ethics of health care allocation or rationing raises a raft of\nissues that are not directly dependent on the potential discriminatory\nimpact on persons with disabilities. Yet, since it is difficult to\nclearly separate the general ethical issues from those raised by the\nfocus on disability, we begin in Section 1 by surveying, first,\ngeneral ethical concerns in health care rationing, and then the\nspecific issues raised by CEA and quality of life as a metric of the\n\u201cbenefit\u201d that health care resources provide. We then turn\nin Section 2 to review why it has been argued that disability poses a\nspecial set of ethical issues in health care rationing. The ethical\nissues of health resource rationing (or \u201cprioritization\u201d\nas it is sometimes called) can be exemplified either at the individual\nlevel of specific allocation decisions \u201cat the bedside\u201d,\nor more generally as a social policy of health care rationing. The\nethical issues at the individual level are reviewed in Section 2, and\nsocial policy issues are considered in Section 3, including whether it\nmakes any difference if access to health care is viewed as a human\nright. We conclude in Section 4 with the unsatisfactory result that we\nremain in a dilemma: refusing to consider disability in health care\nallocation seems irrational and unfair, but taking disability into\naccount raises a range of, apparently, irresolvable philosophical\nissues.\n",
