    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories || Biosemantics and Related Views\n3.2 Biosemantics and Related Views\n\nRuth Millikan and David Papineau were the first to offer teleological\ntheories of content that put a strong emphasis on how mental\nrepresentations are used within a system. In this section, we\nwill mainly focus on Millikan\u2019s \u2018biosemantics\u2019, as\nher theory is often called, while Papineau\u2019s account will be the\nsubject of the next section. Millikan presents her view in great\ndetail in her (1984) and develops it further in her (2004) and (2017,\npart II); compressed versions are provided in her (1989b) and\n(2009).\n\nThe core of Millikan\u2019s biosemantics consists of two claims. The\nfirst is that all representations are, at bottom, messages sent from a\nproducer to one or more consumers. In other words,\nrepresentations always stand midway between (i) a producer system that\nis supposed to generate them and (ii) one or more consumer systems\nthat are supposed to respond to them in specific ways. According to\nMillikan, these systems must be designed to cooperate with each other,\neither by natural selection or by a process of individual \n learning.[9]\n (Note that Millikan\u2019s\nterminology varies; in some of her writings, producers are described\nas \u2018senders\u2019, representations as \u2018intentional\nicons\u2019 or \u2018intentional signs\u2019, and consumers as\n\u2018receivers\u2019 or \u2018interpreters\u2019.)\n\nSince Millikan aims to give a fully general account of representation,\nher theory applies not only to mental representations, but also to\nrepresentational devices that are used for communication between\nindividuals, such as animal signals, linguistic utterances, and even\nmaps and graphs. In these cases, it is whole organisms that count as\nproducers and consumers. One of Millikan\u2019s standard examples is\nthe splash signal that beavers use to warn their conspecifics: the\nproducer of this representation is the beaver that splashes its tail\non the water, and the consumers are nearby beavers that react to the\nsignal by diving for cover.\n\nThe producers and consumers of mental representations, by contrast,\nare subsystems of an organism. In very simple cases, the producer is a\nparticular sensory system, and the consumer a motor system. Consider\nthe often-cited example of the frog that visually detects\nappropriately small, dark, moving objects, and responds to them by\ndarting out its tongue. In this case, the frog\u2019s visual system\ncan be described as the producer, the internal signals produced by it\nas representations, and the \u2018prey-catching system\u2019, i.e.\nthe collection of motor mechanisms that reacts to these signals by\ngenerating the tongue-darting response, as the consumer.\n\nThe second core claim of Millikan\u2019s theory, in a nutshell, is\nthis: every representation belongs to a set of interrelated\nrepresentations, and the representations of this set must correspond\nto certain other (usually external) states in a systematic way to\nenable the consumer to perform its proper functions. Or, to put it\ndifferently, (i) every representation R that is sent by a producer P\nto a consumer C belongs to a set of interrelated representations that\nP can send to C, and (ii) each representation of this set, if it is\ntokened, must \u2018map onto\u2019 (correspond to) a particular\nstate of affairs in order for C to function properly (Millikan 1984,\n96\u2013102; 1989b, 283\u2013290; and 2004, 71\u201386). The particular state that a\nrepresentation must map onto is, of course, the represented state of\naffairs, the content of this representation. (Note that,\nstrictly speaking, this formulation of Millikan\u2019s second claim\nonly covers descriptive/\u2018belief-like\u2019 representations;\nMillikan\u2019s theory of directive/\u2018desire-like\u2019\nrepresentations and her account of \u2018pushmi-pullyu\nrepresentations\u2019, i.e. of representations that are at once\ndescriptive and directive, will be omitted here. For details on\ndirective representations, cf. Millikan 1984, 96\u2013102 and 2004,\n191\u2013201; for pushmi-pullyu representations, cf. Millikan 1995.)\n\nTo unpack the second claim, let us return to the beaver splash\nexample. According to Millikan, a particular splash, produced by a\nbeaver in location l at time t, is really a complex signal, consisting\nof the splash, the time and the location. Looking at the splash signal\nin this way, we can see that it belongs to a large set of interrelated\nsignals consisting of the (same type of) splash in combination with\nmany different times and locations. Moreover, since the consumers in\nthis case are beavers that (typically) react to the signals by diving\nfor cover, it is clear that there is indeed a systematic\ncorrespondence relation that must obtain between the splash signals\nand certain states in the world in order for the consumers\u2019\nbehavior to fulfill a biological function. To put it briefly, signals\nof the form splash at location l and time t must correspond\nto states of the form danger at location l and time t: if\nthis correspondence relation obtains, the consumer beavers (often)\nescape from danger by diving for cover; if it is does not obtain, they\nmerely waste valuable energy. (This systematic correspondence\nrelationship is described as a \u2018mapping rule\u2019, a\n\u2018mapping function\u2019, or a \u2018semantic mapping\u2019 by\nMillikan.)\n\nThere are two respects, however, in which our initial formulation of\nthe second claim needs to be refined. First, we should note that in\nmost cases, a correspondence between representation and represented\nstate of affairs is not strictly necessary to enable the consumer to\nperform its proper functions; it is only necessary if the consumer is\nto perform its proper functions \u201cin the Normal way\u201d. By\nthis expression, Millikan refers to the way in which the\nconsumer\u2019s functions have generally been performed on those\noccasions that were crucial for the proliferation or preservation of\nthis (kind of) consumer (Millikan 1984, 100; 1989b, \n 286\u2013287).[10]\n Hence, to\nidentify the mapping that determines the contents for a given set of\nrepresentations R1, \u2026, Rn, we need to (i)\nlook at those past occasions where ancestral consumers of the relevant\nkind made the type of fitness contributions that led to the\nproliferation or preservation of consumers of this kind, and (ii) ask\nwhich correspondence relationships between R1, \u2026,\nRn and other states of affairs obtained in these situations\nthat help to explain how the consumers were able to make these\ncontributions. In the case of the beaver splashes, e.g., we must look\nat past occasions where the ancestors of today\u2019s beavers\nresponded to splash signals in a way that made a crucial contribution\nto their fitness (which, we may assume, are situations where they\nresponded by diving for cover), and ask which correspondence\nrelationships between the signals and other states of affairs help to\nexplain these fitness contributions. Presumably, these are precisely\nthose correspondence relationships between signals and danger that we\nhave identified above.\n\nTo incorporate this point into our formulation of Millikan\u2019s\nsecond claim, we can restate it thus: (i) every representation that is\nsent by a producer P to a consumer C belongs to a set of interrelated\nrepresentations that P can send to C, and (ii) it is a Normal\ncondition for C\u2019s performance of its proper functions that\nrepresentations of this set map onto certain other states in a\nsystematic way, i.e. according to a particular \u2018mapping\nrule\u2019.\n\nAnother respect in which Millikan\u2019s second core claim needs to\nbe refined concerns the mapping rule that relates representations to\ntheir contents. Millikan describes this relationship as an\n\u201cisomorphism\u201d or \u201chomomorphism\u201d obtaining\nbetween the set of representations on the one hand and the set of\nrepresented states of affairs on the other (Millikan 2004, ch. 6;\n2013b; 2020). The general idea is this: the mapping rule assigns to\nevery representation (of the relevant set) a represented state of\naffairs, and does so in such a manner that transformation relations\nbetween representations correspond to transformation relations between\nrepresented states affairs. This condition is fulfilled in a\nstraightforward way in the beaver splash example, where\ntransformations of a splash signal that consist in the substitution of\na particular time t* (for t) or location l*\n(for l) correspond to transformations that consist in the\nsubstitution of the very same time t* (for t)\nor location l* (for l) at the level of the represented\nstate of affairs. But it can also be fulfilled in more interesting\nways, e.g. by a set of sentences where the substitution of one name\nfor another (\u201cGinger\u201d for \u201cFred\u201d) corresponds\nto the substitution of one object for another (Ginger for\nFred) at the level of the represented states of affairs.  (For an\nin-depth discussion of this aspect of Millikan\u2019s theory,\ncf. Shea 2013.)\n\nImportantly, Millikan\u2019s second core claim is a fully general\nthesis, and is thus intended to apply to systems of representations\nthat are more complex than the system of beaver splash signals. Take\none of Millikan\u2019s favorite examples, the waggle dance of the\nhoney bee. Different waggle dances do not only vary with respect to\nthe time and place of their performance, as beaver splashes do, but\nalso with respect to the length and direction of the \u2018waggle\nrun\u2019. Furthermore, variations of the latter kind make a\nsignificant difference to the responses of the consumer bees: the\nlength and direction of their subsequent flights in search of food\nNormally depends on the length and direction of the waggle run. Hence,\nwe get a more complex mapping rule that takes us from dances with\ndifferent waggle run lengths and directions (performed in\nlocation l at time t) to states of the form nectar\nsource located in direction r at distance d (relative to location l,\nat\n time t).[11]\n This is the rule that specifies the correspondence relations that\nmust obtain between dances and nectar positions for the consumer\nbees\u2019 behavior to fulfill its biological functions (in the\nNormal way).\n\nOne aspect of Millikan\u2019s theory that has received much attention\nin the literature is the fact that it entails, at least in certain\ncases, content ascriptions of a distinctive kind. This is well\nillustrated by the frog example. Let us suppose, for the sake of\nsimplicity, that the frog\u2019s sensory-perceptual representation\nbelongs to a set of representations that only vary with respect to the\ntime and place of their occurrence, and let us call this the system of\n\u2018R-representations\u2019. To find out what the content of the\nR-representations is, according to Millikan, we must first identify\nthe proper function(s) of the frog\u2019s prey-catching system (the\nconsumer of the R-representations). Plausibly, the prey-catching\nsystem has the function of providing the frog with food, since there\ncan be no doubt that the procurement of food was the fitness-enhancing\neffect that ancestral prey-catching systems (in ancestral frogs) had\non former occasions that led to the proliferation and preservation of\nsuch systems. In a second step, we have to figure out what the\ncorrespondence relation is that has to obtain between the\nR-representations and the world if the prey-catching system is to\nperform its food-providing function in the Normal way (i.e. in the way\nthat the ancestral systems did it). The answer is, quite obviously,\nthat the correspondence relation has to obtain between\nR-representations and the presence of frog food. Hence, an\nR-representation occurring in location l at time t has the content\nthere is frog food present in l at t, rather than (say)\nthere is a fly in l at t or there is a small, dark,\nmoving object in l at t (cf. Millikan 1991, 163). (This point\nwill be discussed further in\n section 4.1.)\n\nThe central role that the representation consumer plays in this story\nhas led many interpreters to describe Millikan\u2019s theory as a\n\u2018consumer theory\u2019 or an \u2018output-oriented\nversion\u2019 of teleosemantics (see, e.g., Jacob 2000; Neander 2004;\nShea 2007). According to this interpretation, Millikan maintains that\nthe representation producer, while necessary for an item\u2019s\nrepresentational status, plays no role in determining its content,\nwhich depends exclusively on the functional nature of the relevant\nconsumer. While there are many passages in Millikan\u2019s earlier\nwritings that do indeed suggest such a view (cf. Millikan 1984, ch. 6,\nand especially Millikan 1989b), it should be noted that Millikan\nherself rejects this \n interpretation.[12]\n Moreover, it is\nclear that Millikan puts greater emphasis on the\n\u2018input-side\u2019 of representational mechanisms in her more\nrecent work, and often stresses the complementary roles of producers\nand consumers. In her (2017), for instance, she goes to some lengths\nto argue that representations which are Normally produced always carry\nnatural information about their contents (where \u2018natural\ninformation\u2019 is understood in a non-Dretskean way), and in other\nwritings, she even maintains that informational considerations of this\nkind can be employed to answer certain recalcitrant objections to her\ntheory (as we will see below). This may suggest that Millikan\u2019s\noriginal account, summarized above, must be supplemented with a claim\nabout natural information, but whether this is indeed the case is an\nissue that cannot be resolved here.\n\nSome argue that Millikan\u2019s theory has advantages in comparison\nwith Dretske\u2019s indicator semantics (see e.g., Godfrey-Smith 1989\nand Millikan 2004). On Millikan\u2019s theory, a representation\nR can represent that some environmental feature F is\npresent even if it was never the case that the presence of an\nR guaranteed the presence of an F. It suffices, on\nher theory, that Rs mapped onto Fs often enough for\nthe representation\u2019s consumers to have (so to speak) benefited\nfrom that mapping. Hence, there is no need to provide independently\nspecifiable \u201cchannel conditions\u201d for the mapping\nrelation.\n\nIt can also be argued that Millikan has solved the problem of distal\ncontent for innate as well as learned concepts. Neither retinal images\nnor light reflected from prey feed a frog. So it can be argued, in the\ncase of the frog\u2019s perceptual representations, that the Normal\ncondition for the proper functioning of its consumer (the\nprey-catching mechanism) is that the representation maps onto frog\nfood, not that it maps onto light reflected from the prey, or onto\nretinal images. \n\nOne objection that can be raised against Millikan\u2019s theory has\nto do with omnipresent beneficial background conditions. The prima\nfacie worry is whether her theory succeeds in ruling them out as\ncontents of ordinary perceptual representations. To stay with the same\nexample, consider that other things besides frog food were required\nfor a contribution to fitness on past occasions when the frog\u2019s\nperceptual representation was used by the prey-catching system (e.g.,\noxygen and gravity). Does her theory entail that the frog\u2019s\nperceptual representation has, in addition to the content there is\nfrog food, contents like the oxygen concentration is above\n18% or the local value of gravity is close to g?\nAccording to several interpreters, Millikan can easily avoid this\nconsequence. She can admit that there are many conditions that the\nfrog\u2019s representational state (state R, for short) must\ncorrespond to if the prey-catching system is to fulfill its functions,\nbut insist that it is only those conditions that are specific\nto R (i.e. that are not required, and do not Normally obtain, when R\nis absent) that constitute R\u2019s content (Shea 2005, 40; Bergman\n 2021, 3\u20134).[13]\n This would rule out conditions involving the\noxygen concentration or the value of gravity. (Interestingly, Millikan\nherself seems to favor a different answer to the problem, one that\nmirrors her reply to the next objection; cf. Millikan 1993, 127.)\n\nAnother objection to Millikan\u2019s theory is it yields content\nascriptions that are overly specific, and thus implausible. Consider\nthe fact that all sorts of circumstances could prevent a contribution\nto fitness: for example, an infected fly or a crow standing nearby\ncould spell disease or death instead of nutrition for the frog (Hall,\n1990). On this basis, Neander (1995) argues that Millikan\u2019s\ntheory has the unintended consequence that the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation has the content food that is not infected, when no\ncrow is standing by \u2026 , etc. Millikan\u2019s reply to\nthis objection (cf. Millikan 2004, 85\u201386; 2009, 404) can be summarized\nas follows: the frog\u2019s representation could only have this\nhighly specific content if the representation\u2019s\nproducer, the frog\u2019s visual system, had the function of\nproducing states that mapped onto such a highly specific state. This,\nin turn, would only be possible if the visual system were sensitive to\nproximal states that carried the information that there is food\nthat is not infected, not in the vicinity of a crow, etc.\nAccording to Millikan, however, there are no such proximal states, so\nthe objection fails (for a critical rejoinder, cf. Mart\u00ednez\n2013a, 437\u2013441). How this response relates to Millikan\u2019s\ncanonical statements of her position (e.g., in Millikan 1984, 1989b),\nand whether it indicates a departure from her original view, are\nquestions that naturally arise at this point, but they will not be\npursued further here. \n\nPietroski (1992) also argues that Millikan\u2019s theory provides\nimplausible content ascriptions, thereby entailing implausible\nintentional explanations. His tale of the kimu is intended to press\nthe point. The kimu are color-blind creatures, until a mutation arises\nwhich results in a mechanism that produces a brain state, B,\nin response to red. Those who inherit this mechanism enjoy being in\nstate B, which leads them to climb to the top of the nearest hill\nevery morning (to see the rising sun or some red flowers). The result\nis that they avoid the dawn-marauding predators, the snorf, who hunt\nin the valley below and, solely as a result of this, there is\nselection for the mutation. As Pietroski wants to describe the case,\nBs have the content there is red (or there is\nsomething red), and the desires that interact with Bs are desires\nto see something red. The point of the story is that Millikan\u2019s\ntheory does not allow us to characterize the kimu in this way. On her\ntheory, the kimu do not see a visual target as red or desire the sight\nof something red, given that it was not the mapping between\nBs and red but between Bs and snorf-free-space that\nwas crucial for the fitness of the kimu (and so for the selection of\nany relevant consumers of the representation). On Millikan\u2019s\ntheory, Bs mean snorf-free-space and there is no\nrepresentation of red in a kimu\u2019s brain.\n\nPietroski argues that biting the bullet is radically revisionist in\nthis case. Behavioral tests, he says, could support his claim. Plant a\nred flag among a crowd of snorf and the kimu will eagerly join them.\nIt is consistent with his story that contemporary kimu might never\nhave seen a snorf and might be unable to recognise one were it stood\nsmack in front of their faces. Intuitively, the kimu do not represent\nsnorf, or the absence of snorf, in any way, according to Pietroski. He\nsuggests that this might be a problem for all teleological theories of\ncontent. However, it is more specifically an objection to biosemantics\nand closely related views (some other teleological theories of content\nimply that the kimu do represent red, see\n section 3.4).\n\nMillikan (2000, 236) agrees that her theory entails that the\nkimu\u2019s B-states represent fewer snorf this way. She\nargues that we need to distinguish between the properties represented\nand the properties that cause representations. How else, she asks,\ncould a tortoise think chow this way, given that being\nnutritious is an invisible property and so could not cause a\nsensory-perceptual representation? Setting aside what a tortoise\nreally thinks, the worry is how a causal theory of content can allow\nfor the representation of that which lies behind the surface features\nof objects.\n\nPrice (2001) offers a detailed teleological theory that is similar to\nMillikan\u2019s. She defends Millikan\u2019s interpretation of the\nmind of the kimu on the ground that it better explains their behavior\n(Price 2001, 113\u2013115). She endorses the idea that the point of making\ncontent ascriptions is to rationalize behavior (as proposed, e.g., by\nDavidson 1984 and Dennett 1987), and her claim is that a desire to\navoid snorf is a better reason to climb to the top of the hill than a\ndesire to see red. Different responses are possible. First, one could\nargue that a desire to see red is reason enough to climb a hill.\nSecondly, one could also question whether it is the role of content\nascriptions to rationalize behavior, or whether this is the\ncrucial role in the context in question.\n\nIn relation to this last point, one can ask more generally if some\ncontent ascriptions are suitable for some theoretical purposes and\nothers for others. One might agree that folk psychological ascriptions\nof intentional mental states are meant to rationalize behavior but\nquestion whether this is their role in cognitive science. In the\nlatter case, the aim is to explain the psychological capacities of\nhumans and (in the case of cognitive neuroethology) other creatures.\nThus a question to ask is what content ascriptions would serve the\nexplanatory purposes of the mind and brain sciences, rather than our\nfolk psychological intuitions. Neander (2006) and Schulte (2012) argue\nthat Millikan\u2019s biosemantics generates the wrong contents for\nmainstream (information-processing) theories of perception in relation\nto the simple system cases discussed in the philosophy literature. A\nprinciple of such mainstream theories is that, in vision, the\n\u2018deeper\u2019 properties of objects that are directly relevant\nfor biological fitness are only represented after the surface features\nof objects are first represented (see, e.g., Palmer 1999). The worry\nis that biosemantics and related theories entail that, at least in\ncertain cases, it is only the \u2018deeper\u2019, beneficial\nproperties that are represented in perception.\n\nTo a large extent, Millikan\u2019s theory has been responsible for\nthe great interest, both positive and negative, that philosophers have\nshown in this general class of theories. Her writings on the topic are\nextensive and this section has only touched on the basics of her\nview.\n",
