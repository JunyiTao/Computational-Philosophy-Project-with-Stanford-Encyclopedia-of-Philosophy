    "main_text": "Black Africa\n3. Black Africa\n\nIn terms of volume, Fanon\u2019s turn to Africa in the years\nfollowing the publication of Black Skin, White Mask is\noverwhelmingly occupied with North Africa, and Algeria in particular.\nHowever, he also gives some key attention to sub-Saharan Africa or\nwhat he called \u201cblack Africa\u201d in key essays, editorials,\nand letters collected in Toward the African Revolution.\n\nThough there is some variety in terms of content and particular\nthematic sites, Fanon\u2019s relationship to sub-Saharan Africa is\nfairly consistent. The Algerian experience and ideology that emerged\nfrom it structures Fanon\u2019s take on anti-colonial struggle in the\nregion, but he does not return to questions of anti-Black racism.\nAlgeria is for Fanon the exemplar of revolutionary struggle. So, when\ntalking about black Africa, Fanon will urge forgoing deep connections\nto or retrievals of pre-colonial Africa\u2014something that reflects\nhis early critiques of N\u00e9gritude, for sure, but are in these\nlater essays really plainly political and strategic. Africa is,\nideologically, a unity for Fanon, and that unity is regularly\narticulated in terms of shared colonial struggle. Thus, the divisions\nbetween North and sub-Saharan Africa are erased in a shift of\nperspective; memories and grievances that might flow from legacies of\nthe Arab slave trade are part of the disposable past. What matters is\nthe shared condition in the present, and therefore to the future of\nunified anti-colonial struggle. In \u201cUnity and Effective\nSolidarity are the Conditions for African Liberation\u201d\n(\u201cUnit\u00e9 et solidarit\u00e9 effective sont les\nconditions de la lib\u00e9ration africaine\u201d) (1960), Fanon is\nplain in writing that \u201cinter-African solidarity must be a\nsolidarity of fact, a solidarity of action, a solidarity concrete in\nmen, in equipment, in money\u201d (1964 [1994: 173]). All of these\nsolidarities reflect an anti-essentialist approach to revolutionary\nstruggle, which is consonant with Fanon\u2019s work from the\nbeginning. Also of note is how Fanon, in this context, asserts the\nnecessity of the neutrality of anti-colonial struggle in Africa with\nregard to Cold War alliances. The history of post-independence Africa,\nwhich was the site of so many proxy wars and destabilization efforts\nfrom both sides of the Cold War, bears out Fanon\u2019s observation\nand assertion.\n Fanon also pauses to pay special attention to Patrice Lumumba who\nin 1961, when \u201cLumumba\u2019s Death: Could We Do\nOtherwise\u201d (\u201cLa mort de Lumumba: pouvions-nous faire\nautrement?\u201d)  was written, was known as a promising and important\nrevolutionary leader. Lumumba immediately after became emblematic of\nboth the revolutionary promise and seemingly inevitable neo-colonial\nfate of independent black Africa. This short essay is full of\ninteresting observations, most of which revolve around the failure in\nCongo to unify around an anti-colonial ideology. The lack of this\nideology, he notes, is what made Congo susceptible to Belgian and\nother European/American meddling, which then made Lumumba a natural\ntarget.  Lumumba\u2019s bold identification with anti-colonialism\nenacted what Fanon most wanted: neutrality in the Cold War, singular\nfocus on the nation and the continent against colonialism in all\nforms.  Lumumba\u2019s death leads to the greatest threat to\ngenuinely independent, anti-colonial Africa: national infighting\ninstead of continental solidarity and the return of intra-national\nethnic conflict that destabilizes what is most in need of\nstabilization.\n\nIn the end, it remains unclear how well Fanon understood the diversity\nof sub-Saharan Africa and its difference from North Africa, where he\nspent most of his time on the continent and to which his reflections\nare largely dedicated. The occasional pieces leading up to The\nWretched of the Earth raise interesting questions and show how\nFanon was dedicated to building lines of solidarity and shared\nstruggle. African unity was paramount in Fanon\u2019s work on the\ncontinent, and he boldly extends the Algerian experience to the\ncentral and southern regions of Africa. At the same time, and this\nbecomes particularly clear when he reflects on black Africa\u2019s\nmemory of the slave trade, Fanon in The Wretched of the Earth\ncalls for a suppression of memory and historical difference in the\nname of broader solidarity among the continent\u2019s oppressed\npeoples. This has the strength of forging a vision of a future\nde-linked from the past\u2014a project consistent with the\nrevolutionary conclusion to Black Skin, White Masks\u2014and\nyet seems largely unaware of or unconcerned with the consequences of\nforgetting the historical experiences of large swaths of sub-Saharan\nAfrica. As well, the difference between settler colonies and those\nadministered from a distance fades a bit when Fanon travels his\nreflections to black Africa, a difference that has received a more\nnuanced treatment in postcolonial theory since Fanon.\n\nThat said, work by Nigel Gibson in Fanonian Practices in South\nAfrica (2011) and Achille Mbembe in Critique of Black\nReason (2013 [2017]) and Politiques de\nl\u2019inimiti\u00e9 (2016), as well as essays by thinkers\nsuch as Mabogo Percy More, Richard Pithouse, and others, have placed\nFanon in critical dialogue with sub-Saharan African political\nrealities and emerging theoretical movements. This is some of the most\nexciting contemporary work in Fanon studies and indicates the rich,\nprovocative resources in his work for the twenty-first century.\n",
