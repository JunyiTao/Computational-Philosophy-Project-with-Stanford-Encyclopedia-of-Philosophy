Moreover, it invites us to\nreconsider how perception, cognition, affect, and intentional behavior\ninteract. There have been various attempts to understand the cognitive\nprocesses responsible for the formation of delusions, based on the\nassumption, widely shared in cognitive neuropsychology, that\nunderstanding such processes can lead to the formulation of more\nempirically sound theories of neurotypical cognition (see Marshall and\nHalligan 1996, pp. 5\u20136; Langdon and Coltheart 2000, pp.\n185\u20136). Understanding how delusions come about, whether they are\nresponses to unusual experiences, and whether a reasoning deficit is\nresponsible for their development can shed light on standard processes\nof belief formation. One basic question is what comes first,\nperceptual experience or belief (see Campbell 2001). Are delusions\nframes of mind that, once adopted, alter our way of seeing the world?\nOr do they emerge as explanations for our unusual perceptual\nexperiences? Does having delusions signal a breakdown of rationality,\nand if so, what makes us irrational when we sincerely report a\ndelusional belief?\n\nAnother debated issue is whether delusions should be characterized as\nbeliefs at all, given that they share features with acts of\nimagination (Currie 2000), desires (Egan 2009), acceptances (Frankish\n2009), and perceptual states (Hohwy and Rajan 2012). Can delusions\nqualify as beliefs when they are inconsistent with other things that\nwe believe? And when they fail to be responsive to the evidence\navailable to us? Bayne and Pacherie 2005, Bortolotti 2009 and 2012,\nand Miyazono 2018 have offered defenses of the doxastic nature of\ndelusions, whereas other authors have emphasised the differences\nbetween delusions and typical instances of belief. An interesting\nposition defended by Schwitzgebel 2012 is that delusions are\nin-between states, because they match the dispositional profile of\nbeliefs only in part. Schwitzgebel\u2019s position has been\nchallenged by philosophers who argue that delusions play a belief-role\nin explaining and predicting intentional action (see Bortolotti 2012;\nBayne and Hattiangadi 2013). More recently, the doxastic nature of\ndelusions has been further called into question by authors emphasising\nthe experiential or social nature of delusions (see for instance,\nFeyaerts et al. 2021; Bell, Raihani and Wilkinson 2020; Miyazono and\nSalice 2021). The nature of delusions is still a hotly debated\nissue.\n\nAnother strand of investigation in this area is whether the presence\nof delusions signals a failure of self knowledge. There are several\napparent manifestations of poor knowledge of the self in delusions\n(see Kircher and David 2003; Amador and David 1998). When we are\nattributed delusions of passivity, we may not recognize a movement as\nour own, and thus have a distorted sense of our personal boundaries;\nin thought insertion, we come to believe that there is a thought in\nour head that has been placed there by a third party (e.g., Stephens\nand Graham 2000). Sometimes we act or feel in a way that is\nincompatible with the content of our delusions, or are unable to\nendorse the content of our delusion with reasons that are regarded by\nothers as good reasons (e.g., Gallagher 2009; Bortolotti and Broome\n2008, 2009; Fern\u00e1ndez 2010). Finally, the presence of delusions\nmay make it difficult for us to remember our experienced past\naccurately and to plan for the future, because we are unreliable\nautobiographers (e.g., Gerrans 2009, 2014).\n",
