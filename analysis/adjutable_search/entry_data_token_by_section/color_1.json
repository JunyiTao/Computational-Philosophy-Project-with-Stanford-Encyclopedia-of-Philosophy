    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Color || A Problem with Color\n1.1 A Problem with Color\n\nThe visual world, the world as we see it, is a world populated by\ncolored objects. Typically, we see the world as having a rich tapestry\nof colors or colored forms\u2014fields, mountains, oceans, skies,\nhairstyles, clothing, fruit, plants, animals, buildings, and so on.\nColors are important in both identifying objects, i.e., in locating\nthem in space, and in re-identifying them. So much of our perception\nof physical things involves our identifying objects by their\nappearance, and colors are typically essential to an object\u2019s\nappearance, that any account of visual perception must contain some\naccount of colors. Since visual perception is one of the most\nimportant species of perception and hence of our acquisition of\nknowledge of the physical world, and of our environment, including our\nown bodies, a theory of color is doubly important.\n\nOne of the major problems with color has to do with fitting what we\nseem to know about colors into what science (not only physics but the\nscience of color vision) tells us about physical bodies and their\nqualities. It is this problem that historically has led the major\nphysicists who have thought about color, to hold the view that\nphysical objects do not actually have the colors we ordinarily and\nnaturally take objects to possess. Oceans and skies are not blue in\nthe way that we naively think, nor are apples red (nor green). Colors\nof that kind, it is believed, have no place in the physical account of\nthe world that has developed from the sixteenth century to this\ncentury.\n\nNot only does the scientific mainstream tradition conflict with the\ncommon-sense understanding of color in this way, but as well, the\nscientific tradition contains a very counter-intuitive conception of\ncolor. There is, to illustrate, the celebrated remark by David\nHume:\n\n\nSounds, colors, heat and cold, according to modern philosophy are not\nqualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind. (Hume 1738: Bk III,\npart I, Sect. 1, [1911: 177]; Bk I, IV, IV, [1911: 216]) \n\n\nPhysicists who have subscribed to this doctrine include the\nluminaries: Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, Newton, Thomas Young, Maxwell\nand Hermann von Helmholtz. Maxwell, for example, wrote:\n\n\nIt seems almost a truism to say that color is a sensation; and yet\nYoung, by honestly recognizing this elementary truth, established the\nfirst consistent theory of color. (Maxwell 1871: 13 [1970: 75]) \n\n\nThis combination of eliminativism\u2014the view that physical objects\ndo not have colors, at least in a crucial sense\u2014and\nsubjectivism\u2014the view that color is a subjective\nquality\u2014is not merely of historical interest. It is held by many\ncontemporary experts and authorities on color, e.g., Zeki 1983, Land\n1983, and Kuehni 1997. Palmer, a leading psychologist and cognitive\nscientist, writes:\n\n\nPeople universally believe that objects look colored because they are\ncolored, just as we experience them. The sky looks blue because it is\nblue, grass looks green because it is green, and blood looks red\nbecause it is red. As surprising as it may seem, these beliefs are\nfundamentally mistaken. Neither objects nor lights are actually\n\u201ccolored\u201d in anything like the way we experience them.\nRather, color is a psychological property of our visual experiences\nwhen we look at objects and lights, not a physical property of those\nobjects or lights. The colors we see are based on physical properties\nof objects and lights that cause us to see them as colored, to be\nsure, but these physical properties are different in important ways\nfrom the colors we perceive. (Palmer 1999: 95) \n\n\nThis quote, however, needs unpacking. Palmer is obviously challenging\nour ordinary common-sense beliefs about colors. Specifically, he is\ndenying that objects and lights have colors in the sense of\ncolors-as-we-experience-them (or colors as we see them), As far as\nthis goes, it is compatible with objects and lights having colors in\nsome other sense, e.g., colors, as defined for scientific purposes.\nSecondly, he is saying that color (i.e., color-as-we-experience it) is\na psychological property, which in turn, might be interpreted in\ndifferent ways. Accordingly, the view is quite complex (see the next\nsection). If we examine the writings of others in the scientific\ntradition, we find that their views are also complex. The view maybe\ncolor-eliminativism, but it is not merely that.\n",
