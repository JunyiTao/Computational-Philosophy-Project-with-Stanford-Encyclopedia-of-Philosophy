    "preamble": "\n\nClassical logic requires each singular term to denote an object in the\ndomain of quantification\u2014which is usually understood as the set\nof \u201cexisting\u201d objects. Free logic does not. Free logic is\ntherefore useful for analyzing discourse containing singular terms\nthat either are or might be empty. A term is empty if it either has no\nreferent or refers to an object outside the domain.\n\nMost free logics have been first-order, their quantifiers ranging over\nindividuals. Recently, however, some work on higher-order free logics\nhas appeared. Corine Besson (2009) argues that internalist theories of\nnatural kinds require second-order free logics whose quantifiers range\nover kinds, and she finds precedent for this idea ranging as far back\nas Cocchiarella (1986). Andrew Bacon, John Hawthorne, and Gabriel\nUzquiano (2016) explore the possibility of using a higher-order free\nlogic to resolve certain intensional paradoxes, but they find that\nthis idea faces daunting difficulties. Timothy Williamson (2016)\nreluctantly concurs. This article, however, focuses mainly on\nfirst-order logics.\n\nSection 1 lays out the basics of free logic, explaining how it differs\nfrom classical predicate logic and how it is related to inclusive\nlogic, which permits empty domains or \u201cworlds.\u201d Section 2\nshows how free logic may be represented by each of three formal\nmethods: axiom systems, natural deduction rules and tree rules.\nVarying conventions for calculating the truth values of atomic\nformulas containing empty singular terms yield three distinct forms of\nfree logic: negative, positive and neutral. These are surveyed in\nSection 3, along with supervaluations, which were developed to augment\nneutral logics. Section 4 is critical, examining three anomalies that\ninfect most free logics. Section 5 samples applications of free logic\nto theories of description, logics of partial or non-strict functions,\nlogics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics that are in\na certain sense Meinongian. Section 6 takes a glance at free\nlogic\u2019s history.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Basics\n1.1 Definition of Free Logic\n\nFree logic is formal logic whose quantifiers are interpreted in the\nusual way\u2014that is, objectually over a specified domain\n\\(\\bD\\)\u2014but whose singular terms may denote objects outside of\n\\(\\bD\\), or not denote at all. Singular terms include proper names\n(individual constants),\n definite descriptions,\n and such functional expressions as \u2018\\(2 + 2\\)\u2019. Since\n classical (i.e., Fregean) predicate logic\n requires that singular terms denote members of \\(\\bD\\), free logic is\na \u201cnonclassical\u201d logic. Where \\(\\bD\\) is, as usual, taken\nto be the class of existing things, free logic may be characterized as\nlogic the referents of whose singular terms need not exist.\n1.2 How Free Logic Differs from Classical Predicate Logic\n\nKarel Lambert (1960) coined the term \u2018free logic\u2019 as an\nabbreviation for \u2018logic free of existence assumptions with\nrespect to its terms, singular and general\u2019. General terms are\npredicates. Lambert was suggesting that just as classical predicate\nlogic generalized Aristotelian logic by, inter alia,\nadmitting predicates that are satisfied by no existing thing\n(\u2018is a Martian\u2019, \u2018is non-self-identical\u2019,\n\u2018travels faster than light\u2019), so free logic generalizes\nclassical predicate logic by admitting singular terms that denote no\nexisting thing (\u2018Aphrodite\u2019, \u2018the greatest\ninteger\u2019, \u2018the present king of France\u2019).\n\nBecause classical logic\u2019s singular terms must denote existing\nthings (when, as usual, \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019 is read as\n\u201cthere exists\u201d), classical logic is unreliable in\napplication to statements containing singular terms whose referents\neither do not exist or are not known to. Consider, for example, the\ntrue statement:\n\n(S)\nWe detect no motion of the earth relative to the ether,\n\n\nusing \u2018the ether\u2019 as a singular term for the light-bearing\nmedium posited by nineteenth century physicists. The reason why (S) is\ntrue is that, as we now know, the ether does not exist. According to\nclassical logic, however, (S) is false, because it implies the\nexistence of the ether. Free logic allows such statements to be true\ndespite the non-referring singular term. Indeed, it allows even\nstatements of the form \\({\\sim}\\exists x\\) \\(x=t\\) (e.g., \u201cthe\nether does not exist\u201d) to be true, though in classical logic,\nwhich presumes that \\(t\\) refers to an object in the quantificational\ndomain, they are self-contradictory.\n\nFree logic accommodates empty singular terms (those that\ndenote no member of the quantificational domain \\(\\bD)\\) by rejecting\ninferences whose validity depends on the classical presumption that\nthey must denote members of \\(\\bD\\). Consider, for example, the rule\nof universal instantiation (specification): from the premise\n\u201cEvery \\(x\\) (in \\(\\bD)\\) satisfies \\(A\\)\u201d we may infer\n\u201c\\(t\\) satisfies \\(A\\).\u201d This rule, whose formal\nexpression is: \n\n\\[ \\forall xA \\vdash A(t/x), \\]\n\n\nis invalid in free logic; for even if every object in \\(\\bD\\)\nsatisfies \\(A\\), if \\(t\\) does not denote a member of \\(\\bD\\), then\n\\(A(t/x)\\) may be false. (Here and elsewhere \\(A(t/x)\\) is the result\nof replacing all occurrences of \\(x\\) in \\(A\\) by individual constant\n\\(t\\); if there are no such occurrences, then \\(A(t/x)\\) is just\n\\(A\\).) Likewise invalid is existential generalization: the principle\nthat from a formula \\(A\\) containing a singular term \\(t\\) we may\ninfer that there is something in \\(\\bD\\) that satisfies \\(A(x//t)\\),\nthe result of replacing one or more occurrences of \\(t\\) in\n\\(A\\) by \\(x\\): \n\n\\[ A \\vdash \\exists xA(x//t), \\]\n\n\nIf \\(t\\) does not denote an object in \\(\\bD\\) then the truth of \\(A\\)\ndoes not guarantee that there exists in \\(\\bD\\) an object that\nsatisfies \\(A(x//t)\\). Though free logic rejects such classical\ninferences, it accepts no classically invalid inferences; hence it is\nstrictly weaker than classical logic for a language with the same\nvocabulary.\n\nTo distinguish terms that denote members of \\(\\bD\\) from those that do\nnot, free logic often employs the one-place \u201cexistence\u201d\npredicate, \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 (sometimes written simply as\n\u2018\\(\\rE\\)\u2019). For any singular term \\(t\\), \\(\\rE!t\\) is true\nif \\(t\\) denotes a member of \\(\\bD\\), false otherwise.\n\u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 may be either taken as primitive or (in\nbivalent free logic with identity) defined as follows: \n\n\\[ \\rE !t \\eqdf \\exists x(x=t). \\]\n\n\nUsing \u2018E!\u2019 we can express classical logic\u2019s blanket\npresumption that singular terms denote members of \\(\\bD\\) as an\nexplicit premise, E\\(!t\\), for selected terms \\(t\\). Thus we can\nformulate the following weaker analogs of universal instantiation:\n\n\\[ \\forall xA, \\rE!t \\vdash A(t/x) \\]\n\n\nand existential generalization: \n\n\\[ A, \\rE!t \\vdash \\exists xA(x//t), \\]\n\n\nwhich are valid in free logic.\n1.3 Relation of Free Logic to Inclusive Logic\n\nClassical predicate logic presumes not only that all singular terms\nrefer to members of the quantificational domain \\(\\bD\\), but also that\n\\(\\bD\\) is nonempty. Free logic rejects the first of these\npresumptions. Inclusive logic (sometimes also called\nempty or universally free logic) rejects them both.\nThus while inclusive logic for a language containing singular terms\nmust be free, free logics need not be inclusive.\n\nMany existential assertions\u2014e.g., \\(\\exists x(x=x),\\) \\(\\exists\nx(Px \\rightarrow Px),\\) \\(\\exists x(Px \\rightarrow \\forall\nyPy)\\)\u2014are true in all nonempty domains and hence are valid in\nboth classical logic and non-inclusive free logic. But since all\nexistentially quantified formulas are false in the empty domain, none\nare valid in inclusive logic. Correlatively, since all universally\nquantified formulas are true in the empty domain, none are\nself-contradictory in inclusive logic. Even vacuously universally\nquantified formulas (formulas of the form \\(\\forall xA\\), where \\(x\\)\nis not free in \\(A)\\) are true in the empty domain. Hence the\nschema: \n\n\\[ \\forall xA \\rightarrow A, \\text{ where } x \\text{ is not free in } A, \\]\n\n\nwhich is valid in both classical logic and non-inclusive free logic,\nis invalid in inclusive logic. Inclusive logic also invalidates some\nof the laws of confinement\u2014e.g., \n\n\\[ \\forall x(P \\amp A) \\leftrightarrow(P \\amp \\forall xA), \\text{ where } x \\text{ is not free in } P, \\]\n\n\nthat are used for prenexing formulas (giving quantifiers the widest\npossible scope) or purifying them (giving quantifiers the narrowest\npossible scope). And in inclusive logic the formula: \n\n\\[ \\forall x(A \\leftrightarrow x=t), \\]\n\n\nwidely used in the theory of definite descriptions, is not equivalent,\nas it otherwise is, to: \n\n\\[ \\forall x(A \\rightarrow x=t) \\amp A(t/x), \\]\n\n\nsince with \\(\\bD\\) empty and \\(A(t/x)\\) false, the first but not the\nsecond is true. Where there is need for such regularities, a\nnon-inclusive free logic may be preferable to an inclusive one. Yet\nbecause inclusivity frees logic from one more existential presumption,\nmany free logicians favor it.\n2. Formal Systems\n\nLogics may be represented in various ways. Axiom systems, natural\ndeduction systems and trees (or, equivalently, tableaux) are among the\nmost common. This section presents all three for the bivalent\ninclusive form of free logic known as Positive Free Logic (PFL) and\nmentions some variants. (For the meaning of the term\n\u201cpositive\u201d in this context see\n Section 3.2).\n PFL is formulated in a first-order language \\(\\bL\\) without sentence\nletters or function symbols, whose primitive logical operators are\nnegation (not) \u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019, the conditional (if-then)\n\u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019, the universal quantifier (for all)\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019, identity \u2018=\u2019 and\n\u2018E!\u2019, the others being defined as usual. We assume for the\nsake of definiteness that the formulas of \\(\\bL\\) are closed (contain\nno unquantified variables) and that they may be vacuously quantified\n(have the form \\(\\forall xA\\) or \\(\\exists xA\\), where \\(x\\) does not\noccur free in \\(A)\\). An occurrence of a variable is\nquantified if it lies within the scope of an operator such as\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019 that binds that\nvariable; otherwise it is free.\n2.1 Axiom Systems\n\nPFL may be axiomatized, with modus ponens as the sole inference rule,\nby adding the following schemas to the tautologies of classical\npropositional logic: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tag{A1} &A \\rightarrow \\forall xA \\\\ \\tag{A2} &\\forall x(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (\\forall xA \\rightarrow \\forall xB) \\\\ \\tag{A3} &\\forall xA(x/t), \\text{ if } A \\text{ is an axiom} \\\\ \\tag{A4} &\\forall xA \\rightarrow (\\rE!t \\rightarrow A(t/x)) \\\\ \\tag{A5} &\\forall x \\rE!x. \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nOnce again, \\(A(x/t)\\) is the result of replacing all occurrences of\nindividual constant \\(t\\) in \\(A\\) by the variable \\(x\\). If there are\nno such occurrences, then \\(A(x/t)\\) is just \\(A\\). In (A1) the\nvariable \\(x\\) is not free in \\(A\\) (since otherwise \\(A\\) would be an\nopen formula and formulas of \\(\\bL\\) are closed). However, \\(x\\) may\nbe free in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) in (A2) and in \\(A\\) in (A3) and (A4).\n\n(A4) and (A5) are special axioms for free logic. The others are\nclassical. (A4) modifies the classical principle: \n\n\\[\\tag{A4c} \\forall xA \\rightarrow A(t/x) \\]\n\n\nby using \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 to restrict specification. (A4)\nstipulates in effect that the quantifiers range over all\nobjects that satisfy \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019, (A5) that they range\nonly over objects that satisfy \u2018E!\u2019. Omitting\n(A5) and replacing (A4) with (A4c) yields classical logic. To obtain a\nnon-inclusive free logic, we may add to (A1)\u2013(A5) the axiom\n\\(\\exists x\\rE!x\\)\u2014or any axiom of the form \\(\\exists xT\\) such\nthat for any term \\(t, T(t/x)\\) is a tautology.\n\nFor languages containing the identity predicate, we also need:\n\n\\[\\tag{A6} s=t \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow A(t//s)), \\]\n\n\nwhere, as above, \\(A(t//s)\\) is the result of replacing one or more\noccurrences of \\(s\\) in \\(A\\) by \\(t\\), and either \n\n\\[\\tag{A7} t=t \\]\n\n\nif all self-identity statements, including those whose singular term\nis empty, are to be true or \n\n\\[\\tag{A7-} \\forall x(x=x) \\]\n\n\nif not (see Sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2\n below). If \u2018E!\u2019 is defined in terms of the identity\npredicate as indicated in\n Section 1.2,\n then (A4) takes the form: \n\n\\[ \\forall xA \\rightarrow(\\exists y(y=t) \\rightarrow A(t/x)). \\]\n\n\n\u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 cannot be defined without the identity\npredicate (Meyer, Bencivenga and Lambert, 1982).\n\nFree logic can be formalized without either \u2018=\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019. (A1)\u2013(A3) remain unchanged, but (A4) and\n(A5) are replaced respectively by: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tag{A\\(4'\\)} & \\forall y(\\forall xA \\rightarrow A(y/x)) \\\\ \\tag{A\\(5'\\)} & \\forall x\\forall yA \\rightarrow \\forall y\\forall xA. \\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(A\\(4')\\), like (A4), restricts specification to objects within\n\\(\\bD\\), but it uses a quantifier instead of \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 to\ndo so. The quantifier permutation axiom (A\\(5')\\) is redundant in the\npresence of the identity axioms but, as Fine proved in (1983), is\nindependent of the other axioms.\n\nThe formulas used in the axiom systems discussed so far are closed,\nbut some free logics allow open formulas\u2014i.e., formulas that\ncontain free variables. These logics follow one of two conventions for\nvariable assignments. Those that assign to each free variable a member\nof \\(\\bD\\) are called E\\(^+\\)-logics; those that do not are\ncalled E-logics. The following specification rule is valid in\nE\\(^+\\)-logics but not in E-logics: \n\n\\[ \\forall xA \\vdash A(v/x). \\]\n\n\n(Here \\(A(v/x)\\) is the result of replacing every occurrence of the\nvariable \\(x\\) in \\(A\\) by a variable \\(v\\) that is free for \\(x\\) in\n\\(A\\).) Conversely, the following substitution rule is valid in\nE-logics but not in E\\(^+\\)-logics: \n\n\\[ A \\vdash A(t/x). \\]\n\n\nBut since this article employs closed formulas, the distinction\nbetween E- and E\\(^+\\)-logics may here be ignored. (See Williamson\n(1999) for an illuminating discussion of problems engendered by\npermitting open formulas in inclusive logics.)\n2.2 Natural Deduction Rules\n\nPFL can also equivalently be formulated in a natural deduction system.\nThe introduction and elimination rules for the operators of\npropositional logic and identity are as usual. The quantifier\nintroduction and elimination rules are restricted by use of the\npredicate \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019, as follows:\n\n\n\n\\((\\forall\\rI)\\)\nGiven a derivation of \\(A(t/x)\\) from \\(\\rE!t\\), where \\(t\\) is\nnew and does not occur in \\(A\\), discharge \\(\\rE!t\\) and infer\n\\(\\forall xA\\). \n\n\\((\\forall \\rE)\\)\nFrom \\(\\forall xA\\) and E\\(!t\\) infer \\(A(t/x)\\). \n\n\\((\\exists \\rI)\\)\nFrom \\(A\\) and \\(\\rE!t\\) infer \\(\\exists xA(x//t)\\). \n\n\\((\\exists \\rE)\\)\nGiven \\(\\exists xA\\) and a derivation of a formula \\(B\\) from\n\\(A(t/x) \\amp \\rE!t\\), where \\(t\\) is new and does not occur in either\n\\(A\\) or \\(B\\), discharge \\(A(t/x) \\amp \\rE!t\\) and infer \\(B\\) from\n\\(\\exists xA\\).  \n\n\nThe variable \\(x\\) need not be free in \\(A\\), in which case \\(A(t/x)\\)\nis just \\(A\\). \u2018E!\u2019 may either be taken as primitive (in\nwhich case it requires no additional rules) or defined in terms of the\nidentity predicate as in\n Section 1.2.\n For non-inclusive logic, we may add a rule that introduces \\(\\exists\nx\\rE!x\\).\n2.3 Tree Rules\n\nJeffrey-style tree rules (Jeffrey 1991) for PFL can be obtained by\nreplacing the classical rules for existentially and universally\nquantified formulas with the following:\n\n\nExistential Rule: If \\(\\exists xA\\) appears\nunchecked on an open path, check it, and\n\nif \\(x\\) is free in \\(A\\), choose a new individual constant \\(t\\)\nand list both \\(\\rE!t\\) and \\(A(t/x)\\) at the bottom of every open\npath beneath \\(\\exists xA\\), and\nif \\(x\\) is not free in \\(A\\), write \\(A\\) at the bottom of every\nopen path beneath \\(\\exists xA\\).\n\n\nUniversal Rule: If \\(\\forall xA\\) appears on\nan open path, then\n\nif \\(x\\) is free in \\(A\\), then where \\(t\\) is an individual\nconstant that occurs in a formula on that path, or a new individual\nconstant if there are none on the path, split the bottom of every open\npath beneath \\(\\forall xA\\) into two branches, writing \\({\\sim}\\rE!t\\)\nat the bottom of the first branch and \\(A(t/x)\\) at the bottom of the\nsecond, and\nif \\(x\\) is not free in \\(A\\), write \\(A\\) at the bottom of every\nopen path beneath \\(\\forall xA\\).\n\n\n\nFor languages that do not allow vacuous quantification, clause (ii)\ncan in each case be omitted. Non-inclusive free logic needs an\nadditional rule that introduces \\(\\rE!t\\) for some new individual\nconstant \\(t\\) if a path does not already contain a formula of this\nform.\n3. Semantics\n\nSemantics for free logics differ in how they assign truth-values to\natomic formulas that are empty-termed\u2014i.e., contain at\nleast one empty singular term. There are three general approaches:\n\nNegative semantics require all empty-termed atomic\nformulas to be false,\nPositive semantics allow some empty-termed atomic\nformulas not of the form E!t to be true, and\nNeutral (or nonvalent) semantics require all\nempty-termed atomic formulas not of the form E!t to be\ntruth-valueless.\n\n3.1 Negative Semantics\n\nA negative semantics is a bivalent semantics on which all empty-termed\natomic formulas (including identity statements) are false. The\ninclusive version presented here makes only minimal adjustments to\nclassical semantics to allow for non-denoting terms.\n\nLet the language \\(\\bL\\) be defined as in\n Section 2.\n Then a negative inclusive model for \\(\\bL\\) is a pair \\(\\langle\n\\bD,\\bI\\rangle\\), where \\(\\bD\\) is a possibly empty set (the domain)\nand \\(\\bI\\) is an interpretation function that assigns referents to\nindividual constants and extensions to predicates such that:\n\nfor each individual constant \\(t\\) of \\(\\bL\\), either \\(\\bI(t) \\in\n\\bD\\) or \\(\\bI(t)\\) is undefined, and\nfor each \\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\) of \\(\\bL, \\bI(P) \\subseteq\n\\bD^n\\).\n\n\n\\((\\bD^n\\) is the set of \\(n\\)-tuples of members of \\(\\bD\\), a 1-tuple\nof an object \\(d\\) being just \\(d\\) itself.) Given a model \\(\\langle\n\\bD,\\bI\\rangle\\), we recursively define a valuation function \\(\\bV\\)\nthat assigns truth values to formulas as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\bV(Pt_1 \\ldots t_n) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(t_1),\\ldots,\\bI(t_n) \\text{ are all defined and} \\\\ \\quad\\langle \\bI(t_1),\\ldots, \\bI(t_n)\\rangle \\in \\bI(P); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(s=t) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(s),\\bI(t) \\text{ are defined and } \\bI(s)=\\bI(t); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\rE!t) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(t) \\text{ is defined;} \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV({\\sim}A) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bV(A) = \\rF\\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(A\\rightarrow B) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bV(A) = F \\text{ or } \\bV(B) = T; \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\forall xA) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\text{ for all } d\\in \\bD, \\bV_{(t,d)}(A(t/x)) = \\rT \\\\ \\quad(\\text{where } t \\text{ is any individual constant not in } A \\\\ \\quad\\text{and } \\bV_{(t,d)} \\text{ is the valuation function on the} \\\\ \\quad\\text{model } \\langle \\bD,\\bI^*\\rangle \\text{ such that } \\bI^* \\text{ is just like } \\bI\\\\ \\quad\\text{except that } \\bI^*(t)= d); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n(The metalinguistic symbol \u2018\\(\\Leftrightarrow\\)\u2019 means\n\u201cif and only if.\u201d) A logic adequate to this semantics may\nbe axiomatized by making three changes to the axioms of PFL. The first\nis to add the axiom: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tag{A-} &Pt_1 \\ldots t_n \\rightarrow \\rE!t_i, \\text{ where } 1\\le i\\le n \\text{ and} \\\\ & P \\text{ is any primitive } n\\text{-place predicate, including \\(`\\)='.} \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis expresses the convention that an atomic formula cannot be true\nunless its terms refer. Second, because all empty-termed identity\nstatements are false on a negative semantics, (A7) is invalid and must\nbe replaced by (A7-). Third, since (A2), (A3), (A-) and (A7-) together\nimply (A5), (A5) may be omitted. The resulting logic is known as NFL\n(Negative Free Logic). For languages with function symbols, negative\nfree logic requires in addition this axiom of strictness:\n\n\\[ \\rE!f(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n) \\rightarrow \\rE!t_i, \\text{ where } 1\\le i\\le n, \\]\n\n\nwhich assures that a function has a value only if each of its\narguments does. Because of its unusual treatment of identity, negative\nfree logic validates the equivalence: \n\n\\[ t=t \\leftrightarrow \\rE!t. \\]\n\n\n(This equivalence is sometimes taken as a definition of E\\(!t\\).)\nIdentity statements in negative free logic thus have existential\nimplications. This may be problematic in certain contexts. According\nto Shapiro and Weir (2000), for example, use of such an\n\u201cexistential\u201d notion of identity sullies the\n\u201cepistemic innocence\u201d of some recent efforts to base\nneo-logicist philosophies of mathematics on free logic.\n\nNegative free logic is also peculiar in that it validates the\nprinciple of indiscernibility of nonexistents:\n\n\\[ ({\\sim}\\rE!s \\amp{\\sim}\\rE!t) \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow A(t//s)), \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A(t//s)\\) is the result of replacing one or more occurrences\nof \\(s\\) in \\(A\\) by \\(t\\).\n3.2 Positive Semantics\n\nPositive semantics allow some empty-termed atomic formulas not of the\nform \\(\\rE!t\\) to be true. They are typically bivalent, though there\nare variants that allow truth-value gaps or extra truth values. Only\nbivalent semantics are considered in this section.\n\nPositive semantics treat formulas of the form \\(t=t\\) as true, whether\nor not \\(t\\) is empty. Hence they validate (A7), which affirms all\nself-identity statements, not merely the weaker (A(7-), which affirms\nonly self-identities between nonempty terms.\n\nLike negative semantics, some positive semantics require each singular\nterm to denote either a member of \\(\\bD\\) or nothing at all. But then\nwhen a term fails to denote, the truth value of an atomic formula\ncontaining it cannot as usual be a function of its denotation, and the\nformula must be evaluated in some nonstandard way. To avoid such\nirregularity and yet permit empty-termed formulas to be true, other\npositive semantics allow singular terms to denote, and predicates to\nbe satisfied by, nonmembers of \\(\\bD\\). These nonmembers are collected\ninto a second or outer domain \\(\\bD_o\\), in contrast to which\n\\(\\bD\\) is described as the inner domain. The result is a\ndual-domain semantics.\n\nPositive semantics with dual domains are generally the simplest. The\nmembers of the outer domain \\(\\bD_o\\) typically represent\n\u201cnon-existing\u201d things. Depending on the application, these\nmay be theoretical or ideal entities, error objects (in computer\nscience), fictional objects, merely possible (or even impossible)\nobjects, and so on. Some authors make \\(\\bD\\) a subset of \\(\\bD_o\\),\nwhich is the convention throughout this article; others make the two\ndisjoint. In a bivalent dual-domain semantics each singular term\ndenotes an object in \\(\\bD_o\\) though possibly not in \\(\\bD\\). Thus\n\\(\\bD\\), though not \\(\\bD_o\\), may be empty. Predicates are assigned\nextensions from \\(\\bD_o\\), and the truth-values of atomic formulas\n(whether empty-termed or not) are computed in the usual Tarskian\nfashion: an atomic formula is true if and only if the \\(n\\)-tuple of\nobjects denoted by its singular terms, taken in order, is a member of\nthe predicate\u2019s extension. Identity statements are no exception.\nStatements of the form \\(s=t\\) are true if and only if \\(s\\) and \\(t\\)\ndenote the same object. Hence, even if empty-termed, they may be\ntrue.\n\nMore formally, a dual-domain model for a language \\(\\bL\\) of the sort\ndefined in\n Section 2\n is a triple \\(\\langle \\bD,\\bD_o,\\bI\\rangle\\), where \\(\\bD\\) is a\npossibly empty inner domain, \\(\\bD_o\\) is a nonempty outer domain such\nthat \\(\\bD \\subseteq \\bD_o\\), and \\(\\bI\\) is an interpretation\nfunction such that for every individual constant \\(t\\) of \\(\\bL,\n\\bI(t) \\in \\bD_o\\), and for every \\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\) of\n\\(\\bL, \\bI(P) \\subseteq \\bD_o^n\\). Given a model \\(\\langle\n\\bD,\\bD_o,\\bI\\rangle\\), the valuation function \\(\\bV\\) assigns truth\nvalues to atomic and quantified formulas as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\bV(Pt_1 \\ldots t_n) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\langle\\bI(t_1),\\ldots,\\bI(t_n)\\rangle \\in \\bI(P); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(s=t) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(s)=\\bI(t); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\rE!t) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(t) \\in \\bD; \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\forall xA) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\text{ for all } d\\in \\bD, \\bV_{(t,d)}(A(t/x)) = \\rT \\\\ \\quad(\\text{where } t \\text{ is not in } A \\text{ and } \\bV_{(t,d)} \\text{ is the}\\\\ \\quad\\text{valuation function on the model } \\langle \\bD,\\bD_o,\\bI^*\\rangle \\\\ \\quad\\text{such that } \\bI^* \\text{ is just like } \\bI \\text{ except that}\\\\ \\quad\\bI^*(t)= d); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThe clauses for \u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019 and \u2018 \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n\u2019 are the same as in negative free logic. PFL with classical\nidentity \u2014 that is, the logic axiomatized by (A1)\u2013(A7)\n\u2014 is sound and complete with respect to this semantics (Leblanc\nand Thomason 1968).\n\nDual-domain semantics have been criticized as ontologically\nextravagant. In response, some authors have advocated single-domain\npositive semantics, which assign no denotation to empty singular\nterms. In such semantics empty-termed atomic formulas require\nunconventional treatment. Typically such semantics determine the\ntruth-values of atomic formulas in two different ways: a Tarksi-style\ncalculation for formulas whose terms all refer, and a separate\ntruth-value assignment for empty-termed atomic formulas. The details,\nhowever, tend to get complicated. Antonelli (2000), for example,\nadvocated such a single-domain free logic, which he called\nproto-semantics, but more recently (2007, p. 72) he has characterized\nall semantics for positive free logic as \u201csomewhat\nartificial\u201d and has questioned the logical character of free\nquantification in general.\n3.3 Neutral Semantics\n\nNeutral semantics make all empty-termed atomic formulas not of the\nform E!t truth-valueless. Truth-valueless formulas are often\nsaid to have \u201ctruth-value gaps.\u201d Neutral semantics are of\ntwo types: ordinary neutral semantics, which provide conventions for\ncalculating the truth values of complex formulas directly from their\ncomponents, even when there are empty terms, and supervaluational\nsemantics, which calculate the truth values of complex formulas by\nconsidering all the values that their components could have if their\nempty terms had referents. Ordinary neutral semantics will be\nconsidered in this section, supervaluations in\n Section 3.4.\n\nThe uniform policy of making all empty-termed atomic formulas\ntruth-valueless has the advantages of plausibility and simplicity at\nthe atomic level, but it complicates the evaluation of complex\nformulas. How are the logical operators to function when some of the\nvalues on which they usually operate are absent? Some cases are fairly\nclear. The negation of a truth-valueless formula, for example, is\ngenerally taken to be truth-valueless. But:\n\nIf \\(A\\) is true and \\(B\\) truth-valueless, is \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nfalse or truth-valueless?\nIf \\(A\\) is false and \\(B\\) truth-valueless, is \\(A \\rightarrow\nB\\) true or truth-valueless?\nLet \\(A = (B \\amp C)\\), where \\(x\\) is free in \\(B, B\\) be true of\nsome but not all members of \\(\\bD\\), and \\(C\\) be closed and\ntruth-valueless. Clearly this open formula is either truth-valueless\nof every object in \\(\\bD\\) or truth-valueless of some and false of\nothers. In either case, is \\(\\exists xA\\) truth-valueless or\nfalse?\n\n\nAt one extreme, we might want the operators to generate as many\nplausible truth values as possible in order to validate as many\nclassically valid formulas as we can. At the other, one might arrange\nthings so that all empty-termed formulas are truth-valueless,\nwhich would produce a very weak logic (Lehman 2001). But however we\nchoose, many formulas that are valid in both classical predicate logic\nand the usual forms of free logic\u2014indeed, even in propositional\nlogic\u2014will become invalid. The law of noncontradiction, for\nexample: \n\n\\[ {\\sim}(A \\amp{\\sim}A) \\]\n\n\nis truth-valueless whenever \\(A\\) is (unless we make negations of\ntruth-valueless statements true) and hence becomes invalid. Of course\nthis law and many other standard logical principles remain weakly\nvalid\u2014i.e., not false on any model\u2014and it is possible\nto construct a logic based on weak validity rather than ordinary\nvalidity. But because any such logic will still be weaker than\nclassical logic and because its theorems need not even be true, most\nlogicians reject this strategy. For more on neutral free logic, see\nLehman 1994, 2001, and 2002, pp. 233\u2013237.\n3.4 Supervaluations\n\nNeutral semantics can be made to validate all the theorems of standard\nfree logics by augmenting them with supervaluations. Supervaluations\nwere first formalized by van Fraassen (1966). The version presented\nhere is a variant of Bencivenga\u2019s approach (1981 and 1986).\n\nThe fundamental idea is this: when empty terms deprive a formula of\ntruth-value, supervaluational semantics nevertheless accounts it true\n(or false) if all possible ways of assigning referents to those terms\nagree in making it true (or false). This strategy restores validity to\nmany principles that would lose it in an ordinary neutral semantics.\nThe following instance of the law of noncontradiction:\n\n\\[ {\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt), \\]\n\n\nfor example, is truth-valueless when \\(t\\) is nondenoting (assuming an\nordinary neutral semantics that makes the negation of a\ntruth-valueless formula truth-valueless). Hence in such a semantics\nthe law itself is invalid. Yet were we to assign a referent to \\(t\\),\nthat referent would either be in the extension of \\(P\\) or not. If it\nwere, then \\(Pt\\) would be true. If it were not, then \\(Pt\\) would be\nfalse. In either case \\({\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) would be true. Thus,\nsince all possible ways of assigning referents to \\(t\\) agree in\nmaking \\({\\sim}(Pt \\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) true, we should count \\({\\sim}(Pt\n\\amp{\\sim}Pt)\\) itself as true. In this way the law of\nnoncontradiction can be preserved.\n\nMore explicitly, a supervaluation begins with a neutral model \\(\\bM\\)\nwith a single, possibly empty domain. We then construct the set of\ncompletions of \\(\\bM\\). These may be regarded as bivalent\ndual-domain positive models whose inner domain is the domain of\n\\(\\bM\\), but which also have an outer domain \\(\\bD_o\\) to provide\nreferents for the empty terms. In each completion, singular terms that\nare nonempty in \\(\\bM\\) retain their referents, and those\nthat are empty in \\(\\bM\\) denote a member of \\(\\bD_o - \\bD\\). For each\n\\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\), the extension of \\(P\\) is a subset of\n\\(\\bD_o^n\\) and a superset of \\(P\\text{'s}\\) extension in \\(\\bM\\).\n\nFrom these completions we now construct a supervaluation. A\nsupervaluation of \\(\\bM\\) is a partial assignment of\ntruth-values to formulas that makes a formula true if all completions\nof \\(\\bM\\) make it true, false if they all make it false, and\ntruth-valueless if they disagree. A formula is valid on a\nsupervaluational semantics if and only if it is true on all\nsupervaluations. This semantics validates all and only the theorems of\nPFL (Bencivenga 1981, Morscher & Simons 2001, pp.\n14\u201318).\n\nSupervaluations employ what Bencivenga (1986) calls a\n\u201ccounterfactual theory\u201d of truth: an empty-termed\nstatement is true if it would be true on any\nassignment of referents to its empty terms. This has struck many\ncritics as simply false. Moreover, the logic itself leaves much to be\ndesired. For one thing, supervaluational consequence is too strong.\nThus, for example, although the formula \\(Pt \\rightarrow \\rE!t\\) is\n(quite properly) not valid on a supervaluational semantics,\nnevertheless since \\(\\rE!t\\) is true on every supervaluation on which\n\\(Pt\\) is true, the sequent (derivability statement) \\(Pt \\vdash\n\\rE!t\\) is improperly semantically valid. Therefore, although\nPFL is sound on supervaluational semantics and every semantically\nvalid formula is a theorem of PFL, not all semantically valid sequents\nare provable in PFL. In fact, supervaluational consequence is not\naxiomatizable by any extension of free logic. This follows from a\nresult of Woodruff (1984), who has shown that supervaluational\nsemantics has many of the undesirable properties of second-order\nsemantics. Jerry A. Fodor and Ernest Lapore (1996) argue, furthermore,\nthat the completions needed to construct supervaluations are not\nmeaning-preserving. Hence, they conclude, two alleged advantages of\nsupervaluations\u2014that they explain the meaningfulness of\nsentences with truth value gaps and that they allow us to preserve\nclassical logic\u2014are illusory. Finally, since supervaluations are\nbuilt from completions that are in effect positive dual-domain models,\nwe may wonder whether the detour through supervaluations is worth the\ntrouble, since positive dual-domain models alone are simpler and more\nadequate to PFL.\n4. Generic Anomalies\n\nWhile problems noted above are specific to particular forms of free\nlogic, there are anomalies that infect all, or nearly all, forms. This\nsection considers three: (1) a cluster of problems related to the\napplication of primitive predicates to empty terms, (2) the failure of\nsubstitutivity salva veritate of co-referential expressions,\nand (3) the inability of free logic to express sufficient conditions\nfor existence.\n4.1 Problems with Primitive Predicates\n\nIn classical logic and in positive free logic any substitution\ninstance of a valid formula (or form of inference) is itself a valid\nformula (or form of inference). But in negative or neutral free logic\nthis is not the case. A substitution instance is the result\nof replacing primitive non-logical symbols by possibly more complex\nones of the same semantic type\u2014\\(n\\)-place predicates with open\nformulas in \\(n\\) variables, and individual constants with singular\nterms\u2014each occurrence of the same primitive symbol being\nreplaced by the same possibly complex symbol. The replacement of an\noccurrence of a primitive \\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\) in some formula\n\\(B\\) by an open formula \\(A\\) with free variables \\(x_1 ,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) is performed as follows: where \\(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n\\) are the\nindividual constants or variables immediately following \\(P\\) in that\noccurrence, replace P\\(t_1 \\ldots t_n\\) in \\(B\\) by \\(A(t_i\n/x_i)\\)\u2014the result of replacing \\(x_i\\) by \\(t_i\\) in \\(A\\), for\neach \\(i\\), \\(1\\le i\\le n\\).\n\nLet \\(P\\), for example, be a primitive one-place predicate. Then if\nthe semantics is negative, \\(Pt \\rightarrow \\rE!t\\) is valid. But now\nconsider the substitution instance \\({\\sim}Pt \\rightarrow \\rE!t\\), in\nwhich the open formula \\({\\sim}Px\\) is substituted for \\(P\\). This\nsubstitution instance is false when \\(t\\) is empty. Hence valid\nformulas may have invalid substitution instances. The same holds for\nordinary neutral semantics that make conditionals true whenever their\nconsequents are true.\n\nIn a negative semantics, moreover, the truth value of an empty-termed\nstatement depends arbitrarily on our choice of primitive predicates.\nConsider, for example, a negative free logic interpreted over a domain\nof people that takes as primitive the one-place predicate\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019, meaning \u201cis an adult,\u201d and defines\n\u201cis a minor\u201d by this schema: \n\n\\[ Mt \\eqdf {\\sim}At. \\]\n\n\nFor any non-denoting name \\(t, At\\) is false in this theory; hence\n\\(Mt\\) is true. If we take \u2018is a minor\u2019 as primitive\ninstead, the truth-values of \\(At\\) and \\(Mt\\) are reversed. But why\nshould truth-values depend on primitiveness in this way?\n\nPositive semantics avoid these anomalies. But, if bivalent, in\napplication they force us to assign truth values to empty-termed\nformulas in some other way, often without sufficient reason. Consider,\nfor example, these three formulas, all of which contain the empty\nsingular term \u2018\\(1/0\\)\u2019 (where \u2018\\(/\\)\u2019 is the\ndivision sign): \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} 1/0 &= 1/0 \\\\ 1/0 &\\gt 1/0 \\\\ 1/0 &\\le 1/0 \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nAssuming a bivalent positive semantics, which ones should we make true\nand which false? Since the semantics is positive, \u2018\\(1/0 =\n1/0\\)\u2019 is automatically true. One might argue further that since\n\u2018\\(\\le\\)\u2019 expresses a relationship weaker than\n\u2018=\u2019 and since \u2018\\(1/0 = 1/0\\)\u2019 is true,\n\u2018\\(1/0 \\le 1/0\\)\u2019 should be true as well. But that is\nmerely to mimic with empty terms an inference pattern that holds for\ndenoting terms. To what extent is such mimicry justified? Suppose we\ndo decide to make \u2018\\(1/0 \\le 1/0\\)\u2019 true; should we\ntherefore make \u2018\\(1/0 \\gt 1/0\\)\u2019 false? There are no\nnon-arbitrary criteria for answering such questions. To a large\nextent, of course, the answers don\u2019t matter. There are no facts\nhere; any consistent convention will do. But that\u2019s just the\nproblem. Some convention is needed, and establishing one can be a lot\nof bother for nothing.\n4.2 Substitutivity Failures\n\nClassical predicate logic has the desirable feature that co-extensive\nopen formulas may be substituted for one another in any formula\nsalva veritate\u2014i.e., without changing that\nformula\u2019s truth value. (Open formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(n\\)\nfree variables \\(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\) are coextensive if and\nonly if \\(\\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n (A \\leftrightarrow B)\\) is\ntrue.) But, as Lambert noted in 1974, this principle fails for nearly\nall free logics with identity. Consider, for example, the formula\n\\(t=t\\), where \\(t\\) is empty, which is an instance of the open\nformula \\(x=x\\). Now \\(x=x\\) is coextensive with both \\((x=x \\amp\n\\rE!x)\\) and \\((\\rE!x \\rightarrow x=x)\\), since all three formulas are\nsatisfied by all members of \\(\\bD\\). Hence if co-extensive open\nformulas could be exchanged salva veritate, \\((t=t \\amp\n\\rE!t)\\) and \\((\\rE!t \\rightarrow t=t)\\) would have the same truth\nvalue as \\(t=t\\). But on nearly all free logics this is not the case.\nPositive free logic and the supervaluations described in\n Section 3.4\n make \\(t=t\\) true and \\((t=t \\amp \\rE!t)\\) false; negative free logic\nmakes \\(t=t\\) false and \\((\\rE!t \\rightarrow t=t)\\) true; and any\nordinary neutral free logic whose conditionals are true whenever their\nantecedents are false makes \\(t=t\\) truth-valueless and \\((\\rE!t\n\\rightarrow t=t)\\) true. Many find this troubling because, since\nFrege, it has been widely held that (1) extensions of complex\nlinguistic expressions should be functions of the extensions of their\ncomponents (so that co-extensive components should be exchangeable\nwithout affecting the extension of the whole) and (2) the extension of\na formula (or statement) is a truth value.\n\nOne possible response is to reject (2). Leeb (2006) develops for a\nversion of PFL a dual-domain semantics in which the extensions of\nformulas are abstract states of affairs. In this semantics,\nco-referential open sentences are exchangeable not salve\nveritate, but (as he puts it) salve extensione; that is,\nthe exchange does not alter the state of affairs designated by the\nstatement in which it occurs. But Leeb\u2019s state-of-affairs\nsemantics is so complex that it may discourage application.\n\nThose who wish to retain (2) may be consoled by the following\nobservation: though substitutivity salve veritate of\nco-extensive open formulas fails for nearly all free logics, a related\nbut weaker principle, the substitutivity salve veritate of\nco-comprehensive open formulas, is valid for positive free\nlogics. Open formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(n\\) free variables \\(x_1\n,\\ldots ,x_n\\) are co-comprehensive if every assignment of\ndenotations in the outer domain \\(\\bD_o\\) to \\(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\)\nsatisfies \\(A\\) if and only if it satisfies \\(B\\). Among the open\nformulas mentioned in the previous paragraph, for example, \\(x=x\\) and\n\\((\\rE!x \\rightarrow x=x)\\) are co-comprehensive in a dual-domain\npositive free logic, being satisfied by all members of \\(\\bD_o\\), but\n\\((x=x \\amp \\rE!x)\\) is not co-comprehensive with them, since it is\nsatisfied only by the members of \\(\\bD\\). Unlike co-extensiveness,\nhowever, co-comprehensiveness is not expressible in the language of\nPFL. But it becomes expressible with the introduction of quantifiers\nover the outer domain\u2014a strategy considered in\n Section 5.5.\n4.3 Inexpressibility of Existence Conditions\n\n\u2018Whatever thinks exists,\u2019 \u2018Any necessary being\nexists\u2019, \u2018That which is immediately known exists\u2019:\nsuch statements of sufficient conditions for existence are prominent\nin metaphysical debates. But, somewhat surprisingly, they are not\nexpressible in free logic. Their apparent form is \\(\\forall x(A\n\\rightarrow \\rE!x)\\). But because the universal quantifier ranges just\nover \\(\\bD\\), which is also the extension of E!, this form is valid in\nfree logic\u2014as it is in classical logic with \\(\\rE!x\\) expressed\nas \\(\\exists y\\,y=x\\). No statement of this form\u2014not even\n\u2018all impossible things exist\u2019\u2014can be false. Hence on\nfree logic all such statements are equally devoid of content. Argument\nevaluation suffers as a result. Consider, for example, the obviously\nvalid inference:\n\n\n\n \nI think. \n\n \nWhatever thinks exists. \n\n\\(\\therefore\\)\nI exist.  \n\n\nIts natural formalization in free logic is \\(Ti, \\forall x(Tx\n\\rightarrow \\rE!x) \\vdash \\rE!i\\). But this form is invalid. To obtain\nthe conclusion, we must first deduce \\(Ti \\rightarrow \\rE!i\\) by\nspecification from the second premise and then use modus ponens with\nthe first. But since the logic is free, specification requires the\nquestion-begging premise \\(\\rE!i\\).\n\nUnsatisfactory entailments involving \u201cexistence\nhedges\u201d\u2014predications that entail the existence of their\nobjects\u2014have recently come up in discussions of neutral free\nlogic in particular. Daniel Yeakel (2016, p. 379) argues that\n\u201con any neutral free logic either some existence hedges will\nentail some undesired existence claims, or they will not entail some\ndesired existence claims.\u201d But the example of the previous\nparagraph works for negative and positive free logics as well. A\nremedy is not to be found in free logic alone, but again\nquantification over the outer domain of a dual-domain semantics may\nhelp (see\n Section 5.5).\n5. Some Applications\n\nThis section considers applications of free logic in theories of\ndefinite descriptions, languages that allow partial or non-strict\nfunctions, logics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics\nthat are in a certain sense \u201cMeinongian.\u201d Free logic has\nalso found application elsewhere\u2014most prominently in theories of\npredication, programming languages, set theory, logics of\npresupposition (with neutral semantics), and definedness logics. For\nmore on these and other applications, see Lambert 1991 and 2001b;\nLehman 2002, pp. 250\u2013253; and Nolt 2006, pp.\n1039\u20131053.\n5.1 Theories of Definite Descriptions\n\nThe earliest and most extensive applications of free logic have been\nto the theory of definite descriptions. A definite description is a\nphrase that may be expressed in the form \u201cthe \\(x\\) such that\n\\(A\\),\u201d where \\(A\\) is an open formula with only \\(x\\) free.\nFormally, this is written using a special logical operator, the\ndefinite description operator \u2018\\(\\iota\\)\u2019, as \\(\\iota\nxA\\). Contra Russell, free logic treats definite descriptions\nnot as merely apparent singular terms in formulas whose logical form\nis obtainable only by elaborate contextual definitions, but as genuine\nsingular terms. Thus, like an individual constant, \\(\\iota xA\\) may be\nattached to predicates and (under appropriate conditions) substituted\nfor variables. For any object \\(d\\) in the domain \\(\\bD, \\iota xA\\)\ndenotes \\(d\\) if and only if among all objects in \\(\\bD\\), \\(d\\) and\nonly \\(d\\) satisfies \\(A\\). If in \\(\\bD\\) there is more than one\nobject satisfying \\(A\\), or none, \\(\\iota xA\\) is empty. The\ndescription operator therefore satisfies: \n\n\\[\\tag{LL} \\forall y(y=\\iota xA \\leftrightarrow \\forall x(A \\leftrightarrow x=y)), x \\text{ free in } A. \\]\n\n\n(This formula is sometimes called \u201cLambert\u2019s Law,\u201d\nthough the earliest published mention of it was apparently in Hintikka\n(1959), p. 83.  In the context of Hintikka\u2019s system,\nhowever, it had various unwelcome consquences (see Lambert\n1962; van Fraassen 1991, pp. 8\u201310).)  Adding (LL) to\nthe free logic defined by (A1)\u2013(A6) and (A7-) gives the minimal\nfree definite description theory MFD. MFD is the core of virtually all\nfree description theories, which therefore differ only in the\nadditional principles they endorse.\n\nThere is plenty of room for variation, for MFD fails to specify truth\nconditions for atomic formulas (including identities) when they\ncontain empty descriptions, and there are many ways to do it. Making\nall atomic formulas containing empty descriptions false yields a\nnegative free description theory axiomatizable by adding (LL) to NFL\n(Burge 1974, Lambert 2001h). The result is essentially Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions, but with the\ndescription operator taken as primitive rather than contextually\ndefined.\n\nThe simplest positive free description theory makes all\nidentities between empty terms true. Known as FD2, it may be\naxiomatized by adding (LL) and: \n\n\\[ ({\\sim}\\rE!s \\amp{\\sim}\\rE!t) \\rightarrow s=t \\]\n\n\nto PFL. FD2 is akin to Gottlob Frege\u2019s theory of definite\ndescriptions; but whereas Frege chose a single arbitrary existing\nobject to serve as the conventional referent for empty singular terms,\nFD2 makes this object non-existent. FD2 is readily modeled in a\ndual-domain positive semantics with just one object in the outer\ndomain.\n\nOn FD2 all empty descriptions are intersubstitutable salve\nveritate. But this result is subject to counterexamples in\nordinary language. This statement:\n\nThe golden mountain is a possible object,\n\nfor instance, is true, while this one:\n\nThe set of all non-self-membered sets is a possible object,\n\nis false\u2014though each applies the same predicate phrase \u2018is\na possible object\u2019 to an empty description. Thus we may prefer a\nmore flexible positive free description theory on which identities\nbetween empty terms may be false. The literature presents a surprising\ndiversity of these (Lambert 2001a, 2003c, 2003d, 2003h; Bencivenga\n2002, pp. 188\u2013193; Lehman 2002, pp. 237\u2013250).\n5.2 Logics with Partial or Non-Strict Functions\n\nSome logics employ primitive n-place function\nsymbols\u2014symbols that combine with \\(n\\) singular terms to\nform a complex singular term. Thus, for example, the plus sign\n\u2018+\u2019 is a two-place function symbol that, when placed\nbetween, say, \u20182\u2019 and \u20183\u2019, forms a complex\nsingular term, \u2018\\(2 + 3\\)\u2019 that denotes the number five.\nSimilarly, \u2018\\(^2\\)\u2019 is a one-place function symbol that,\nwhen placed after a term denoting a number, forms a complex singular\nterm that denotes that number\u2019s square. Semantically, the\nextension of a function symbol is a function whose arguments are\nmembers of the quantificational domain \\(\\bD\\), and the resulting\ncomplex term denotes the result of applying that function to the\nreferents of the \\(n\\) component singular terms, taken in the order\nlisted. Since classical logic requires every singular term (including\nthose formed by function symbols) to refer to an object in \\(\\bD\\),\nfor each such function symbol \\(f\\), it requires that:\n\n\\[ \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n\\exists y(y = f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)). \\]\n\n\nHence classical logic prohibits primitive function symbols whose\nextensions are partial functions\u2014functions whose value is for\nsome arguments undefined. Such, for example, is the binary division\nsign \u2018/\u2019, since when placed between two numerals the\nsecond of which is \u20180\u2019, it forms an empty singular term.\nSimilarly, the limit function symbol \u2018lim\u2019 yields an empty\nsingular term when applied to the name of a non-coverging sequence.\nClassical logic can accommodate function symbols for partial functions\nvia elaborate contextual definitions. But then (as with Russellian\ndefinite descriptions) the form in which these function symbols are\nusually written is not their logical form. Free logic provides a more\nelegant solution. Because it allows empty singular terms, symbols for\npartial functions may simply be taken as primitive.\n\nIn applications of free logic involving partial functions, the\nexistence predicate \u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019 is often replaced by the\npostfix definedness predicate \u2018\\(\\downarrow\\)\u2019. For any\nsingular term \\(t, t\\downarrow\\) is true if and only if \\(t\\) has some\ndefinite value in \\(\\bD\\). Thus, for example, the formula\n\u2018\\((1/0)\\downarrow\\)\u2019 is false. While some writers (e.g.,\nFeferman (1995)) distinguish \u2018\\(\\downarrow\\)\u2019 from\n\u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019, the literature as a whole does not, and\n\u2018\\(\\downarrow\\)\u2019 is often merely a syntactic variant of\n\u2018\\(\\rE!\\)\u2019.\n\nIn addition to partial functions, positive free logics can\nalso readily handle non-strict functions. A non-strict\nfunction is a function that may yield a value even if not all of its\narguments are defined. The binary function \\(f\\) such that \\(f(x,y) =\nx\\), for instance, can yield a value even if the \\(y\\)-term is empty.\nSo, for example, the formula \\(f(1, 1/0) = 1\\) can be regarded as\ntrue. Logics for non-strict functions must be positive because in a\nnegative or neutral logic empty-termed atomic formulas, such as \\(f(1,\n1/0) = 1\\), cannot be true. Free logics involving non-strict functions\nfind application in some programming languages (Gumb 2001, Gumb and\nLambert 1991). Such logics may employ a dual-domain semantics in which\nthe referents of empty functional expressions such as\n\u20181/0\u2019 are regarded as error objects\u2014objects\nthat correspond in the running of a program to error messages. Thus,\nfor example, an instruction to calculate \\(f(1, 1/0)\\) might return\nthe value 1, but an instruction to calculate \\(f(1/0, 1)\\) would\nreturn an error message.\n5.3 Logics with Kripke Semantics\n\nKripke semantics for quantified\n modal logics,\n tense logics,\n deontic logics,\n intuitionistic logics, \nand so on, are often free. This is because they index\ntruth to certain objects that we shall call \u201cworlds,\u201d and\nusually some things that we have names for do not exist in some of\nthese worlds. Worlds may be conceived in various ways: they may, for\nexample, be understood as possible universes in alethic modal logic,\ntimes or moments in tense logic, permissible conditions in deontic\nlogic, or epistemically possible states of knowledge in intuitionistic\nlogic. Associated with each world \\(w\\) is a domain \\(\\bD_w\\), of\nobjects (intuitively, the set of objects that exist at \\(w)\\). An\nobject may exist in (or \u201cat\u201d) more than one world but need\nnot exist in all. Thus, for example, Kripke semantics for tense logic\nrepresents the fact that Bertrand Russell existed at one time but\nexists no longer by Russell\u2019s being a member of the domains of\ncertain \u201cworlds\u201d\u2014that is, times (specifically,\nportions of the last two centuries)\u2014but not others (the present,\nfor example, or all future times). Two natural assumptions are made\nhere: that the same object may exist in more than one world (this is\nthe assumption of transworld identity), and that some\nsingular terms\u2014proper names, in particular\u2014refer not only\nto an object at a given world, but to that same object at every world.\nSuch terms are called rigid designators. Any logic\nthat combines rigid designators with quantifiers over the domains of\nworlds in which their referents do not exist must be free.\n\nKripke semantics gives predicates different extensions in different\nworlds. Thus, for example, the extension of the predicate \u2018is a\nphilosopher\u2019 was empty in all worlds (times) before the dawn of\ncivilization and more recently has varied. For rigidly designating\nterms, this raises the question of how to evaluate atomic formulas at\nworlds in which their referents do not exist. Is the predicate\n\u2018is a philosopher\u2019 satisfied, for example, by Russell in\nworlds (times) in which he does not exist\u2014times such as the\npresent? The general answers given to such questions determine whether\na Kripke semantics is positive, negative or neutral.\n\nFor negative or neutral semantics, the extension at \\(w\\) of an\n\\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P\\) is a subset of \\(\\bD_w^n\\). An atomic\nformula can be true at \\(w\\) only if all its singular terms have\nreferents in \\(\\bD_w\\); if not, it is false (in negative semantics) or\ntruth-valueless (in neutral semantics). In a positive semantics,\natomic formulas that are empty-termed at \\(w\\) may nevertheless be\ntrue at \\(w\\). Predicates are usually interpreted over the union\n\\(\\bU\\) of domains of all the worlds, which functions as a kind of\nouter domain for each world, so that the extension of an \\(n\\)-place\npredicate \\(P\\) at a world \\(w\\) is a subset of \\(\\bU^n\\). Some\napplications, however, require predicates to be true of\u2014and\nsingular terms to be capable of denoting\u2014objects that exist in\nno world. If so, we may collect these objects into an outer domain\nthat is a superset of \\(\\bU\\). (They might be fictional objects,\ntimeless Platonic objects, impossible objects, or the like.)\n\nQuantified formulas, like all formulas, are true or false only\nrelative to a world. Thus \\(\\exists xA\\), for example, is true at a\nworld \\(w\\) if and only if some object in \\(\\bD_w\\) satisfies \\(A\\).\nExcept in intuitionistic logic, where it has a specialized\ninterpretation, the universal quantifier is interpreted similarly:\n\\(\\forall xA\\) is true at \\(w\\) if and only if all objects in\n\\(\\bD_w\\) satisfy \\(A\\). Kripke semantics often specify that for each\n\\(w, \\bD_w\\) is nonempty, so that the resulting free logic is\nnon-inclusive\u2014but we shall not do so.\n\nAny of various free modal or tense logics can be formalized by adding\nto a language \\(\\bL\\) of the sort defined in\n Section 2\n the sentential operator \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019. If \\(A\\) is a\nformula, so is \\(\\Box A\\). In alethic modal logic, this operator is\nread \u201cit is necessarily the case that.\u201d More generally, it\nmeans \u201cit is true in all accessible worlds that,\u201d where\naccessibililty from a given world is a different relation for\ndifferent modalities: possibility for alethic logics, permissibility\nfor deontic logics, various temporal relations for tense logics, and\nso on. A typical bivalent Kripke model \\(\\bM\\) for such a language\nconsists of a set of worlds, a binary accessibility relation \\(\\bR\\)\ndefined on that set; an assignment to each world \\(w\\) of a domain\n\\(\\bD_w\\); an \u201couter\u201d domain \\(\\bD_o\\) of objects (which\ntypically is either \\(\\bU\\) or a superset thereof); and a two-place\ninterpretation function \\(\\bI\\) that assigns denotations at worlds to\nindividual constants and extensions at worlds to predicates. For each\nindividual constant \\(t\\) and world \\(w, \\bI(t,w)\\in \\bD_o\\). In such\na model, a singular term is a rigid designator if and only if for all\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\), \\(\\bI(t,w_1) = \\bI(t,w_2)\\). For every\n\\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P, \\bI(P,w) \\subseteq \\bD_w^n\\) if the\nsemantics is negative or neutral; if it is positive, \\(\\bI(P,w)\n\\subseteq \\bD_o^n\\). Truth values at the worlds of a model \\(\\bM\\) are\nassigned by a two-place valuation function \\(\\bV\\) (where \\(\\bV(A,w)\\)\nis read \u201cthe truth value \\(\\bV\\) assigns to formula \\(A\\) at\nworld \\(w\\)\u201d) as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\bV(Pt_1 \\ldots t_n,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\langle\\bI(t_1,w),\\ldots,\\bI(t_n,w)\\rangle \\in \\bI(P,w); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(s=t,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(s,w)=\\bI(t,w); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\rE!t,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bI(t,w) \\in \\bD_w; \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV({\\sim}A,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bV(A,w) = \\rF\\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(A\\rightarrow B,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\bV(A,w) = F \\text{ or } \\bV(B,w) = T; \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\Box A,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\text{ for all } u \\text{ such that } w\\bR u, \\bV(A,u) = \\rT\\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\\\ \\bV(\\forall xA,w) &= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\rT \\Leftrightarrow \\text{ for all } d\\in \\bD_w, \\bV_{(t,d)}(A(t/x),w) = \\rT \\\\ \\quad(\\text{where } t \\text{ is not in } A \\text{ and } \\bV_{(t,d)} \\text{ is the}\\\\ \\quad\\text{valuation function on the model just like } \\bM \\\\ \\quad\\text{except that its interpretation function } \\bI^* \\text{ is} \\\\ \\quad\\text{such that for each world } w, \\bI^*(t,w)= d); \\\\ \\rF \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{array}\\right. \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nUnder the stipulations that admissible models make all individual\nconstants rigid designators and that \\(\\bI(P,w) \\subseteq \\bD_o^n\\),\nthe standard free logic PFL, together with the modal axioms and rules\nappropriate to whatever structure we assign to \\(\\bR\\), is sound and\ncomplete on this semantics.\n\nModal semantics thus defined call for free logic whenever worlds are\nallowed to have differing domains\u2014that is whenever we may have\nworlds \\(u\\) and \\(w\\) such that \\(\\bD_u \\ne \\bD_w\\). For in that case\nthere must be an object \\(d\\) that exists in one of these domains (let\nit be \\(\\bD_w)\\), but not the other, so that any singular term \\(t\\)\nthat rigidly designates \\(d\\) must be empty at world \\(u\\). Hence\n\\({\\sim}\\exists x(x=t)\\) (which is self-contradictory in classical\nlogic) must be true at world \\(u\\). Such a semantics also requires\nfree logic when \\(\\bD_o\\) contains objects not in \\(\\bU\\), for in that\ncase rigid designators of these objects are empty in all worlds.\nFinally, this semantics calls for inclusive logic if any\nworld has an empty domain. Thus, given this semantics, the only way to\nmake the resulting logic unfree is to require that domains be\nfixed\u2014i.e., that all worlds have the same domain\n\\(\\bD\\), that \\(\\bD\\) be non-empty, and that \\(\\bD_o = \\bD\\).\n\nJust this trio of requirements was in effect proposed by Saul Kripke\nin his ground-breaking (1963) paper on modal logic as one of two\nstrategies for retaining classical quantification. (The other, more\ndraconian, strategy was to allow differing domains but ban individual\nconstants and treat open formulas as if they were universally\nquantified.) But such fixed-domain semantics validate the implausible\nformula: \n\n\\[ \\forall x\\Box \\exists y(y = x), \\]\n\n\nwhich asserts that everything exists necessarily and the equally\nimplausible Barcan formula: \n\n\\[ \\forall x\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box \\forall xA \\]\n\n\n(named for Ruth Barcan, later Ruth Barcan Marcus, who discussed it as\nearly as the late 1940s). To see its implausibility, consider this\ninstance: \u2018If everything is necessarily a product of the big\nbang, then necessarily everything is a product of the big bang\u2019.\nIt may well be true that everything (in the actual world) is\nnecessarily a product of the big bang\u2014i.e., that nothing in this\nworld would have existed without it. But it does not seem necessary\nthat everything is a product of the big bang, for other universes are\npossible in which things that do not exist in the actual world have\nother ultimate origins. Because of the restrictiveness and\nimplausibility of fixed-domain semantics, many modal logicians loosen\nKripke\u2019s strictures and adopt free logics.\n\nWe may also drop the assumption that singular terms are rigid\ndesignators and thus allow nonrigid designators. On the\nsemantics considered here, these are singular terms \\(t\\) such that\nfor some worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2, \\bI(t,w_1) \\ne \\bI(t,w_2)\\).\nDefinite descriptions, understood attributively, are the best\nexamples. Thus the description \u201cthe oldest person\u201d\ndesignates different people at different times (worlds)\u2014and no\none at times before people existed (\u201cworlds\u201d \\(w\\) at\nwhich \\(\\bI(t,w)\\) is undefined).\n\nNonrigid designators, if empty at some worlds, require free logics\neven with fixed domains. (Thus classical logic with nonrigid\ndesignators is possible only if we require for each singular term\n\\(t\\) that at each world \\(w\\), \\(t\\) denotes some object in\n\\(\\bD_w\\).) On some semantics for nonrigid designators, the quantifier\nrule must differ from that given above, and other adjustments must be\nmade. For details, see Garson 1991, Cocchiarella 1991, Schweitzer 2001\nand Simons 2001.\n\nIntuitionistic logic,\n too, has a Kripke semantics, though special valuation clauses are\nneeded for \u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019 in order to accommodate the special meanings\nthese operators have for intuitionists, and \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 is\ngenerally not used. The usual first-order intuitionistic logic, the\nHeyting predicate calculus (HPC)\u2014also called the intuitionistic\npredicate calculus\u2014has the theorem \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) and hence\nis not free. But intuitionists admit the existence only of objects\nthat can in some sense be constructed, while classical mathematicians\nposit a wider range of objects. Therefore users of HPC cannot\nlegitimately name all the objects that classical mathematicians can.\nWorse, they cannot legitimately name objects whose constructibility\nhas yet to be determined. Yet some Kripke-style semantics for HPC do\nallow use of names for such objects (semantically, names of objects\nthat \u201cexist\u201d at worlds accessible from the actual world\nbut not at the actual world itself). Some such semantics, though\nintended for HPC, have turned out, unexpectedly, not to be adequate\nfor HPC. An obvious fix, advocated by Posy (1982), is to adopt a free\nintuitionistic logic. For more on this issue, see Nolt 2007.\n5.4 Logics of Fiction\n\nBecause fictions use names that do not refer to literally existing\nthings, free logic has sometimes been employed in their analysis. So\nlong as we engage in the pretense of a story, however, there is no\nspecial need for it. It is true, for example, in Tolkien\u2019s\nThe Lord of the Rings that Gollum hates the sun, from which\nwe can legitimately infer that in the story there exists\nsomething that hates the sun. Thus quantifiers may behave classically\nso long as we consider only what occurs and what exists \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d (The general logic of fiction, however, is often\nregarded as nonclassical, for two reasons: (1) a story may be\ninconsistent and hence require a\n paraconsistent logic,\n and (2) the objects a story describes are typically (maybe always)\nincomplete; that is, the story does not determine for each such object\n\\(o\\) and every property \\(P\\) whether or not \\(o\\) has \\(P\\).)\n\nThe picture changes, however, when we distinguish what is true in the\nstory from what is literally true. For this purpose logics of fiction\noften deploy a sentence operator that may be read \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d Here we shall use \u2018\\(\\mathbf{S}_x\\)\u2019 to mean\n\u201cin the story \\(x\\),\u201d where \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 is to be\nreplaced by the name of a specific story. Anything within the scope of\nthis operator is asserted to be true in the named story; what is\noutside its scope is to be understood literally. (For a summary of\ntheories of what it means to be true in a story, see Woods 2006.)\n\nWith this operator the statement \u2018In the story, The Lord of\nthe Rings, Gollum hates the sun\u2019 may be formalized as\nfollows: \n\n\\[\\tag{GHS} \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(\\text{Gollum\nhates the sun}). \\]\n\n\nThe statement that in The Lord of the Rings something hates\nthe sun is: \n\n\\[ \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}\\exists x(x \\text{ hates\nthe sun}). \\]\n\n\nThis second statement follows from the first, even though Gollum does\nnot literally exist. But it does not follow that there exists\nsomething such that it, in The Lord of the Rings, hates the\nsun: \n\n\\[ \\exists x \\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(x \\text{ hates\nthe sun}). \\]\n\n\nand indeed that statement is not true, for, literally, Gollum does not\nexist. Since the sun, however, exists both literally and in the story,\nthe statement: \n\n\\[ \\exists x\\mathbf{S}_{The\\: Lord\\: of\\: the\\: Rings}(\\text{Gollum\nhates } x) \\]\n\n\nis true and follows by free existential generalization from (GHS)\ntogether with the true premise \u2018\\(\\rE!(\\text{the sun})\\)\u2019.\nThus free logic may play a role in reasoning that mixes fictional and\nliteral discourse.\n\nTerms for fictional entities also occur in statements that are\nentirely literal, making no mention of what is true \u201cin the\nstory.\u201d Consider, for example, the statement: \n\n\\[\\tag{G} \\text{Gollum is more famous than G\u00f6del.} \\]\n\n\nMark Sainsbury (2005, ch. 6) holds that reference failure invariably\nmakes such statements false and hence that they are best represented\nin a negative free logic. Others, however\u2014including Orlando 2008\nand Dumitru and Kroon 2008\u2014question Sainsbury\u2019s treatment,\nmaintaining that statements like (G) are both atomic and true. If so,\nthey require a positive free logic. The logic must be free because it\ndeals with an empty singular term, and it must be positive, because\nonly on a positive semantics can empty-termed atomic statements be\ntrue. One must still decide, however, whether the name\n\u2018Gollum\u2019 is to be understood as having no referent or as\nhaving a referent that does not exist.\n\nIf \u2018Gollum\u2019 has no referent, then (G) might be handled by\na single-domain positive semantics. But that semantics would\nhave to treat atomic formulas non-standardly; it could not, as usual,\nstipulate that (G) is true just in case the pair \\(\\langle\\)Gollum,\nG\u00f6del\\(\\rangle\\) is a member of the extension of the predicate\n\u2018is more famous than\u2019; for if there is no Gollum, there is\nno such pair. On such a semantics \u2018Gollum is more famous than\nG\u00f6del\u2019 would not imply that something is more famous than\nG\u00f6del.\n\nIf, on the other hand, terms such as \u2018Gollum\u2019 refer to\nnon-existent objects, then those objects could inhabit the outer\ndomain of a dual-domain positive free logic. Dumitru (2015), for\nexample, lays out such a dual-domain semantics for fictional discourse\nusing free descriptions and compares it with a supervaluational\napproach that also uses free descriptions. In a such a dual-domain\nsemantics, atomic formulas have their standard truth conditions: (G)\nis true just in case \\(\\langle\\)Gollum, G\u00f6del\\(\\rangle\\) is a\nmember of the extension of \u2018is more famous than\u2019.\nMoreover, if we allow quantifiers over that outer domain, then\n\u2018Something is more famous than G\u00f6del\u2019 (where the\nquantifier ranges over the outer domain) does follow from\n\u2018Gollum is more famous than G\u00f6del\u2019, though\n\u2018There literally exists something more famous than\nG\u00f6del\u2019 (where the quantifier ranges over the inner domain)\ndoes not. Meinongian logics of fiction employ this strategy.\n5.5 Meinongian Logics\n\nAlexius Meinong is best known for his view that some objects that do\nnot exist nevertheless have being. His name has been associated with\nvarious developments in logic. Some free logicians use it to describe\nany dual-domain semantics. For others, Meinongian logic is something\nmuch more elaborate: a rich theory of all the sorts of objects we can\nthink about\u2014possible or impossible, abstract or concrete,\nliteral or fictional, complete or incomplete. In this section the term\nis used to describe logics stronger than the first type but possibly\nweaker than the second: positive free logics with an extra set of\nquantifiers that range over the outer domain of a dual-domain\nsemantics.\n\nWhether such logics can legitimately be considered free is\ncontroversial. On older conceptions, free logic forbids any\nquantification over non-existing things (see Pa\u015bniczek 2001 and\nLambert\u2019s reply in Morscher and Hieke 2001, pp. 246\u20138).\nBut by anybody\u2019s definition, Meinongian logics in the sense\nintended here at least contain free logics when the inner\ndomain is interpreted as the set of existing things. Moreover, on the\nstrictly semantic definition used in this article\n (Section 1.1),\n which is also that of Lehman 2002, whether the members of \\(\\bD\\)\nexist is irrelevant to the question of whether a logic is free. For a\ndefense of this definition, see Nolt 2006, pp. 1054\u20131057.\n\nHistorically, quantification over domains containing objects that do\nnot exist has been widely dismissed as ontologically irresponsible.\nQuine (1948) famously maintained that existence is just what an\nexistential quantifier expresses. Yet nothing forces us to interpret\n\u201cexistential\u201d quantification over every domain as\nexpressing existence\u2014or being of any sort. Semantically, an\nexistential quantifier on a variable \\(x\\) is just a logical operator\nthat takes open formulas on \\(x\\) into truth values; the value is T if\nand only if the open formula is satisfied by at least one object in\nthe quantifier\u2019s domain. That the objects in the domain have or\nlack any particular ontological status is a philosophical\ninterpretation of the formal semantics. Alex Orenstein (1990) argues\nthat \u201cexistential\u201d is a misnomer and that we should in\ngeneral call such quantifiers \u201cparticular.\u201d That\nsuggestion is followed in the remainder of this section.\n\nQuantifiers ranging over the outer domain of a dual-domain semantics\nare called outer quantifiers, and those ranging over the\ninner domain inner quantifiers. If the inner particular\nquantifier is interpreted to mean \u201cthere exists\u201d and the\nmembers of the outer domain are possibilia, then the outer particular\nquantifier may mean something like \u201cthere is possible a thing\nsuch that\u201d or \u201cfor at least one possible thing.\u201d We\nshall use the generalized product symbol \u2018\\(\\Pi\\)\u2019 for the\nouter universal quantifier and the generalized sum symbol\n\u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 for its particular dual. This notation\nenables us to formalize, for example, the notoriously puzzling but\nobviously true statement \u2018Some things don\u2019t exist\u2019\n(Routley 1966) as: \n\n\\[ \\Sigma x{\\sim}\\rE!x. \\]\n\n\nSince in a dual-domain semantics all singular terms denote members of\nthe outer domain, the logic of outer quantifiers is not free but\nclassical. With \u2018E!\u2019 as primitive, the free inner\nquantifiers can be defined in terms of the classical outer ones as\nfollows: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\forall xA &\\eqdf \\Pi x(\\rE!x \\rightarrow A) \\\\\n\\exists xA &\\eqdf \\Sigma x(\\rE!x \\amp A). \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThe outer quantifiers, however, cannot be defined in terms of the\ninner.\n\nLogics with both inner and outer quantifiers have various\napplications. They enable us, for example, to formalize substantive\nsufficient conditions for existence and hence adequately express the\nargument of\n Section 4.3,\n as follows: \n\n\\[ Ti, \\Pi x(Tx \\rightarrow \\rE!x) \\vdash \\rE!i. \\]\n\n\nThis form is valid. The co-comprehensiveness of open formulas \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) in \\(n\\) free variables \\(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\) (see\n Section 4.2),\n can likewise be formalized as: \n\n\\[ \\Pi x_1 \\ldots \\Pi x_n (A \\leftrightarrow B). \\]\n\n\nRichard Grandy\u2019s (1972) theory of definite descriptions holds\nthat \\(\\iota xA=\\iota xB\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nco-comprehensive and thus is readily expressible in a Meinongian\nlogic. Free logics with outer quantifiers have also been employed in\nlogics that are Meinongian in the richer sense of providing a theory\nof objects (including, in some cases, fictional objects) that is\ninspired by Meinong\u2019s work (Routley 1966 and 1980, Parsons 1980,\nJacquette 1996, Pa\u015bniczek 2001, Priest 2005 and 2008, pp.\n295\u20137).\n6. History\n\nInclusive logic was conceived and formalized before free logic per\nse was. Thus, since inclusive logic with singular terms is de\nfacto free, the inventors of inclusive logics were, perhaps\nunwittingly, the inventors of free logic. Bertrand Russell suggested\nthe idea of an inclusive logic in (1919, p. 201, n.). Andrezej\nMostowski (1951) seems to have been among the first to formalize such\na logic. But Morscher and Simons (2001, p. 27, note 3) document\nearlier discussions of the idea, and Bencivenga (2014) holds that\nJa\u015bkowski (1934) contains, at least implicitly, the first\ninclusive logic. Theodore Hailperin (1953), Czeslaw Lejewski (1954)\nand W. V. O. Quine (1954) made important early contributions. It was\nQuine who dubbed such logics \u201cinclusive.\u201d\n\nHenry S. Leonard (1956) was the first to develop a free logic per\nse, though he used a defective definition of \u2018E!\u2019.\nKarel Lambert began his prolific series of contributions to the field\nin (1958), critiquing Leonard\u2019s definition, and then coining the\nterm \u201cfree logic\u201d in (1960). The early systems of free\nlogic were positive. Negative free logic was developed by Rolf Schock\nin a series of papers during the 1960s, culminating in (1968). Timothy\nSmiley suggested the idea of a neutral free logic in (1960), but the\nfirst thoroughgoing treatment appeared in Lehman 1994. Supervaluations\nwere described in Mehlberg 1958, pp. 256\u2013260, as a device for\nhandling, not neutral free logic, but vagueness. But their\nformalization and application to free logic began with van Fraassen\n1966, in which the term \u201csupervaluation\u201d was introduced.\nDual-domain semantics were discussed in lectures by Lambert, Nuel\nBelnap and others as early as the late 1950s, but it appears that\nChurch 1965 and Cocchiarella 1966 were the first published\naccounts.\n",
