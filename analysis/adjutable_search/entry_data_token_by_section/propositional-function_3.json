    "main_text": "Fregean Functions and Concepts\n4. Fregean Functions and Concepts\nIn Frege we have a fairly general interpretation of sentences as\nexpressing functions applying to arguments. The view that I explore\nhere is one that he develops in the 1890s.\nConsider the sentence\n\nMy dog is asleep on the floor.\n\nThis sentence, like all linguistic expressions, has\nboth a sense and a referent. Its sense is an abstract object\u2014a\nthought. Its referent is its truth value (which at the moment is the\nTrue). We will discuss Frege's analysis of the thought soon, but right\nnow let us look at the referents of the expressions that make up this\nsentence.\nThe expression \u2018my dog\u2019, according to Frege, is a\nsingular term. It picks out an object (my dog, Zermela). The\nexpression \u2018is asleep on the floor\u2019 refers to a\nconcept. Concepts are functions. In this case, the concept is\na function from objects to truth values (which are also objects). So,\nwe can treat the above sentence as representing the concept __\nis asleep on the floor as applying to the object my\ndog. \nFrege's concepts are very nearly propositional\nfunctions in the modern sense. Frege explicitly recognizes them as\nfunctions. Like Peirce's rhema, a concept is\nunsaturated. They are in some sense incomplete. Although\nFrege never gets beyond the metaphorical in his description of the\nincompleteness of concepts and other functions, one thing is clear:\nthe distinction between objects and functions is the main division in\nhis metaphysics. There is\nsomething special about functions that makes them very\ndifferent from objects.\nLet us consider \u2018my dog is asleep on the floor\u2019\nagain. Frege thinks that this sentence can be analyzed in various\ndifferent ways. Instead of treating it as expressing the application\nof __ is asleep on the floor to my dog, we can think\nof it as expressing the application of the concept\n\nmy dog is asleep on __\nto the object\n\nthe floor\n(see Frege 1919). Frege recognizes what is now a\ncommonplace in the logical analysis of natural language.\nWe can attribute more than one logical form to a single\nsentence. Let us call this the\nprinciple of multiple analyses. Frege does not claim\nthat the principle always holds, but as we shall see, modern type\ntheory does claim this.\nWith regard to the sense of sentences, they are also the result of\napplying functions to objects. The sense of \u2018my dog\u2019 is an\nabstract object. The sense of \u2018is asleep on the floor\u2019 is\na function from individual senses, like that of \u2018my dog\u2019,\nto thoughts (see Frege 1891). The sense of \u2018is asleep on the\nfloor\u2019 is a conceptual sense. It would seem that the\nprinciple of multiple analyses holds as much for senses as it does for\nreferents. Frege, however, sometimes talks as if the senses of the\nconstituent expressions of a sentence are actually contained somehow\nin the thought. It is difficult to understand how all such senses\ncould be in the thought if there are different ways in which the\nsentence can be analyzed into constituent expressions.\n\nIn addition to concepts and conceptual senses, Frege\nholds that there are extensions of concepts. Frege calls an extension\nof a concept a \u2018course of values\u2019. A course of values is\ndetermined by the value that the concept has for each of its\narguments. Thus, the course of values for the concept __ is a\ndog records that its value for the argument Zermela is the True\nand for Socrates is the False, and so on. If two concepts have the\nsame values for every argument, then their courses of values are the\nsame. Thus, courses of values are extensional.\nFor more about Frege's theory of concepts and its relation to his logic, see\nthe entry on Frege's theorem and foundations for arithmetic.\n",
