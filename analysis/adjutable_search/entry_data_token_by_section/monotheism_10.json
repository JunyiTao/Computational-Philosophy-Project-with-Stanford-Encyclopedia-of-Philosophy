    "main_text": "Are the \u201cMonotheistic Traditions\u201d Really Monotheistic? || Christianity and the Trinity\n7.3 The Shri Vaishnavas and Monotheism\n\n\nThe Shri Vaishnavas provide our third example of a monotheism that is\n\u201ctainted\u201d by elements apparently in tension with it. The\nShri Vaishnavas identify Vishnu with the Brahman. According to\nRamanuja (1017?\u20131137?), Brahman is personal. Indeed, he is\nthe supreme person (paratman), creator and Lord, who leads\nsouls to salvation. Far from having no (positive) attributes, as some\nVedantins maintain, Brahman is the sum of all \u201cnoble\nattributes\u201d\u2014omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and\nall-merciful. He is also advitya (without rival). Shiva, Brahma, and\nthe other gods of the Hindu pantheon are Brahman\u2019s agents or servants,\ncreated and commissioned by him. (They have the same status, in short,\nthat angels have in the western religious traditions.)\n\n\n\u201cThe entire complex of intelligent and non-intelligent beings\n(souls and matter [prakriti]) \u2026 is real and constitutes the\nform, i. e., the body of the highest Brahman\u201d (Ramanuja 1962,\n88). The space-time world with all it contains is thus related to God\nas our bodies are related to our souls. A soul-body relationship,\naccording to Ramanuja, is a relationship between (1) support and\nsupported, (2) controller and controlled, and (3)\n\u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201caccessory.\u201d (Images of the\nlast relationship are provided by the relations between a master and\nhis \u201cborn servant\u201d or an owner and his disposable\nproperty.) A body is \u201centirely subordinate\u201d to its soul\n(Ramanuja 1962, 424), having no independent reality or value. If the\nspace-time world is Vishnu\u2019s body, then, it is absolutely dependent on\nVishnu, and has little or no value in comparison with him.\n\n\nThe Shri Vaishnava picture of reality is thus clearly monotheistic.\nProblems are created, however, by the fact that the scriptures on which\nthe Shri Vaishnavas draw closely associate Vishnu with his consort\nLakshmi. In the Pancaratras, for example, \u201cthe five functions\nassociated with God\u2019s oversight of the world,\u201d namely, creation,\npreservation, destruction, and \u201cobscuration\u201d and\n\u201cfavoring\u201d (roughly, withholding and bestowing grace) are\nsometimes ascribed to Vishnu and sometimes to Lakshmi (Kumar, 23f).\nAgain, while Ramanuja and his great predecessor, Yamuna, have little or\nnothing to say about Lakshmi in their philosophical writings, she plays\na significant role in their devotional works, where she is described as\nMediatrix between Vishnu and his devotees. Yamuna describes her as\ninseparable from the Lord, for example, and insists that while\nnon-intelligent and intelligent beings (including the gods such as\nBrahma and Shiva) are \u201conly a small part of God\u2019s reality,\n\u2026 the divine consort\u201d is \u201cthe equal match of the\nLord, \u2026 sharing the same auspicious qualities\u201d (Kumar,\n61). Ramanuja, too, claims that Vishnu and Lakshmi are \u201ceternally\nassociated,\u201d and asserts that both possess \u201c\u2018the\nmultitude \u2026 of unlimited, unsurpassed, and innumerable\nauspicious qualities\u2019\u201d (Kumar 66\u20137). All of this is\nregarded as compatible with the oneness or nonduality of \u201cthe\nultimate reality,\u201d however. Thus, Yamuna insists that Brahman\n(Vishnu) is the one without a second who \u201c\u2018neither has, nor\nhad, nor will have an equal or superior capable of being counted as a\nsecond\u2019\u201d (Kumar, 61). Nevertheless, the precise\nrelationship between Vishnu and Lakshmi was left undefined, and it\nremained for later generations to work out fuller accounts which both\nrespected Lakshmi\u2019s importance to ritual and devotion and at the same\ntime protected monotheism. There were two major resolutions.\n\n\nThe first is represented by Lokacarya (1213\u20131323). For Lokacarya,\nthe divine consort\u2019s role is subordinate and, perhaps, ultimately,\nnonessential. Lakshmi displays the \u201cthree essential attributes of\na mediator: mercy \u2026 , dependence on the Lord, \u2026 and\nnon-subservience [to] another [than the Lord].\u201d Her ability to\nmediate between souls and their Lord is thus ultimately dependent on\nher relation to Vishnu. In other words, Shri Lakshmi \u201cmediates\nnot as an equal partner of the Lord \u2026 but only as his dependent\nand subordinate.\u201d There is even a suggestion that Vishnu can\nhimself function as a mediator without Lakshmi\u2019s assistance. Thus,\nLokacarya \u201cpoints out that in the Mahabharata, Krishna himself\nbecomes the mediator, whereas in the Ramayana, Sita becomes the\nmediator.\u201d (The relevance of this remark becomes clear when one\nrecalls that both Krishna and Sita\u2019s consort, Rama, are avataras or\n\u201cdescents\u201d [very roughly, incarnations] of Vishnu.) (Kumar\n102\u201307) Lokacarya, then, preserves monotheism by more or less\ndowngrading Lakshmi\u2019s status.\n\n\nVenkatanatha (1268\u20131369) offers a different resolution. He does\ndistinguish \u201cthe two [salvific] functions of the Lord and his\nconsort,\u201d the Lord being \u201cdepicted as the father who\ndisciplines the sinner,\u201d and Lakshmi as the divine mother who\nintercedes for him. The distinction between these functions is not\nabsolute, however, for the divine consort merely \u201cbring[s] out\nthe \u2018Lord\u2019s natural compassion\u2019 so that that compassion\nbecomes the basis for the spiritual rebirth of the offending\ndevotee\u201d (Kumar 120\u201321). Moreover (and most important for our\npurposes), there is no real or ontological difference between the\ndivine father and the divine mother. Lakshmi is an inseparable\nattribute of Vishnu. Since a substance and its inseparable attributes\n\u201cshare in the same essential nature,\u201d and since one can\u2019t\nunderstand a substance without understanding its \u201cessential and\ninseparable attribute[s],\u201d the Lord and his divine consort form\n\u201ca single reality\u201d (Kumar 146\u20137). Thus\n\u201c\u2018whenever Bhagavan [i.e., Vishnu] is referred to, Lakshmi\nshould also be considered as referred to,\u2019\u201d and when one\noffers oneself to either one is offering oneself to both since the\ndeity to which one offers oneself \u201c\u2018is single [though] it\nrests with two\u2019\u201d (Kumar 124). In short, Venkatanatha\npreserves monotheism by denying that God and his divine consort are\nontologically distinct.\n",
