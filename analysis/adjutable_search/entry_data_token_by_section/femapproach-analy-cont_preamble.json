    "main_text": "\n\nTo the extent that Continental and analytic approaches to feminism\ndiffer, they do so primarily in the theoretical resources to which\nthey appeal: analytic approaches typically take their starting point\nfrom philosophers in the English-speaking world \u2013 Russell,\nMoore, Quine et al. \u2013 while Continental approaches typically\ntake theirs either from Germany \u2013 Hegel, Marx, the Frankfurt\nSchool et al. \u2013 or from France \u2013 Lacan, Kristeva, Derrida\net al. Yet feminist philosophers are not always wedded to one\ntradition over the other; both analytic and Continental feminists look\nto the French philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir, for example, and both\nfind theoretical resources in the works of J.L. Austin and Michel\nFoucault. Feminist work also often reveals the theoretical advantages\nof crossing the lines between analytic and Continental philosophy and\nbetween the two branches of Continental feminism. Indeed, Ann Garry\nrecommends \u201cthat feminists use methodological distinctions very\nsparingly, that is, only when they are needed to avoid confusion or\nare otherwise extremely helpful\u201d (2018, 23). Thus, although this entry\ndistinguishes broadly analytic and broadly Continental feminist\ntraditions, it also tries to clarify intersections and overlaps\nbetween the two traditions as well as the ways in which feminists\nwithin them build on one another\u2019s work. The entry focuses on\nthree topics common to the two traditions: problems of who or what\nwomen are, issues pertaining to freedom and domination, and questions\nof epistemic injustice.\n",
