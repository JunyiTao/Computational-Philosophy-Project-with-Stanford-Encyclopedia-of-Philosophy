Conceptually,\ngender on its own is insufficient to account for the\ncomplexities of identity. Notably, Latin American feminisms have paid\nattention to the ways in which class, race/ethnicity, and sexuality\nare necessary components for understanding the lived experience of\nidentity, which is never conceptualized as pure nor one-dimensional\n(Fem\u00e9nias 2007: 16).\n\nThe idea that class is a key dimension of women\u2019s lives is one\nthat is rooted in Latin American feminist activisms of the late\n19th and early 20th centuries. As previously\nnoted in Section 1 (on the history of Latin American feminism),\nwomen\u2019s fights for equality of this time were framed in terms of\nequitable access to social goods (e.g., education). The impact of this\npush was the transformation of the material lives of people living in\npoverty more generally. Considerations of the importance of class\nconditions in understanding the plight of women and the poor have been\nlong rooted in Latin American feminist ideas. Feminist projects\nconcerned with the advancement of women in civil society converged\nwith labor movements and anti-imperial resistance (e.g., Luisa\nCapetillo). This trend re-emerged during resistance movements of the\n1970s that aligned feminist projects with revolutionary parties of the\nLeft across Latin America. As a result, attention to class dimensions\nhas long been part of the feminist methodology. However, this\nattention has not been without fault. Contemporary theories from the\nwork of Afro-descended women have argued that the overwhelming\nattention paid to class has come at the expense of analyzing the role\nthat racism has played in the marginalization and exclusion of\nAfrican-descended and Indigenous populations (Curiel 2007).\n\nThe reflections on race/ethnicity of Latin American feminist\nmethodology are diverse, demonstrating the racial heterogeneity\ngenerated by the colonial condition. Colonialism not only initiated\ncontemporary understandings of race/ethnicity but generated conditions\nof racial formation under systems of exploitation and subordination.\nSpecifically, the colonial history of Latin America entailed the\nsubordination of Indigenous and Afro-descended peoples (Schutte &\nFemen\u00edas 2010: 407). Economically, colonialism entailed the\nenslavement and exploitation of these populations. Culturally,\ncolonialism ensured the imposition of a socio-symbolic order that\nentrenched whiteness as a norm and cultural authority (Schutte &\nFemen\u00edas 2010: 407). Concurrently, norms of gender and class\nemerge through the production of race, whose economic impact is\nreflected through the link between whiteness and class ascension.\nSubsequently, nation-building projects in Latin America and the\nCaribbean were forged by political elites with patriarchal ideologies\nmired in racism and classism. The impact of these ideologies has\nentailed a racialized social stratification that reflects the\nprivilege of whiteness and leaves women disproportionally affected\n(Curiel 2007: 98).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, feminist reflections on race/ethnicity have\nsought to undermine the racism of national ideologies that have led to\ntheir subordination and marginalization. One such ideology is that of\nmestizaje which emerged as part of nation building projects\nthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Mestizaje favored\nthe formation of a racially-mixed people but came saturated with\nEurocentrism and privileged the whitening of the Americas.\nMestizaje ensured structural inequalities as it racialized\nclass differences while maintaining racism a myth. On the heels of\nthese conditions, notable contributions to the discussion on\nrace/ethnicity in Latin America and the Caribbean have come from\nAfro-descended and Indigenous women who have been systemically\nmarginalized in these social processes. They argue that\nmestizaje functions as a sequel to colonialism that continues\nto entail subordination and marginalization in social life (Curiel\n2007: 98).\n\nRacialized women in Latin America and the Caribbean have also pointed\nto the racism of dominant feminist methodology that took womanhood to\nbe a shared categorical status but dismissed the importance of the\nspecificities determined by race/ethnicity and class identity. In so\ndoing, the voices of racialized women have opened up new avenues for\ncontemporary critical feminist investigation. For instance,\nAfro-descended women have shown how the methodologies of studying\nwomen from colonial times detrimentally read the lives of enslaved\nwomen one-dimensionally as solely victims of slavery, overlooking the\nways in which many participated in acts of resistance. Acts like the\nwaste of household goods or self-induced abortions to avoid the\nenslavement of children are best understood as acts of domestic\nmarronage and need to be read as part of the history of Afro-descended\nwomen in the Americas (Albert 2003). In this context, the call for a\nmore multidimensional analysis of racialized women also entails\ndemonstrating that for racialized women, the public and the private\nspheres are not separate entities as hegemonic feminism purported\n(Curiel 2016: 49). Hence, a call for the blackening of feminism has\nemerged as a way of elucidating the relationship between racism and\nsexism in order to better understand the histories of women throughout\nthe Americas (Carneiro 2005).\n\nFurther, racialized women of Latin America and the Caribbean have\nprovided new constructive frameworks for conceptualizing racialized\nand ethnic identities. One such attempt can be found in the\ndevelopment of Amefricanidad, a term coined by Afro-Brazilian\nscholar L\u00e9ila Gonsalez, that resists the use of\nLatinidad because of its Eurocentric underpinnings, much like\nhow mestizaje downplays the Indigenous and African dimension\nof Latin America and the Caribbean (Curiel 2007: 99). Building on the\nuse of Amefricanidad or Amefricanicity, others have\nargued for the use of the term as a privileged epistemology that\nenhances the visibility of Afro-descended feminism in the region\n(Alvarez & Caldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks the\nimportance of African and Indigenous roots of identity, but also seeks\nto think from within those identities as it pursues an intersectional\napproach to racism, colonialism, and imperialism (Alvarez &\nCaldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks racialized identity,\nbut at the same time signals plurality in its capacity to capture the\nmultiple inheritances of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nBy keeping the impact of the colonial condition at the center of\ntheory, contemporary Latin American and Caribbean feminists have also\ncritically evaluated norms of sexuality, a topic which dominant\nliberal feminism long maintained at the margins. The lesbian movement\nof Latin America and the Caribbean stems from mixed-gender homosexual\norganizations that were in dialogue with the feminist movement of the\nlate 20th century (Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). However, for\nmuch of this time, discussions on sexual preference were set aside\nwithin the liberal feminist agenda. Lesbian feminism, much like the\nlarger panorama of Latin American feminism, is heterogeneous.\nNevertheless, there is one common theoretical denominator: the\nimperative to transform ideas and practices related to\nheteronormativity, lesbianism, and gender relations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 169). At stake in the analysis of lesbian feminism is the way in\nwhich heteronormativity permeates all aspects of lived experience,\nincluding the intersections among sexuality, race/ethnicity, class,\nand gender. For instance, Afro-descended lesbian feminists have linked\nracism and sexism to heteronormativity by arguing that the obligatory\ndimensions of heterosexuality are intimately bound up with the\nreproduction of racist and sexist practices (Curiel 2016: 50). Others\nhave argued that there is an intimate relationship between lesbianism\nand feminism that hinges on the recognition that liberation for women\nis founded in decentering patriarchy, which often involves\nre-negotiating relationships with men and masculinity on all levels\n(Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso 2011: 404).\n\nImplicit in discussions of the complexity of identity is the\nrelationship between the individual and the collective. The\nrelationship between structural collective conditions and the\nformation of individual identity attends to the ways in which human\nbeings are not isolated meaning-makers. However, when the conditions\nof meaning-making reflect the heirlooms of colonialism, oppression,\npatriarchy, or obligatory heterosexuality, tense negotiations are\nrequired between the individual and the collective. Indigenous\nfeminists have negotiated the political and personal value of ethnic\nbelonging with individual feminist claims (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164).\nThe liberal neofeminist movement has long emphasized the importance of\nsexual and reproductive rights of women, but while these issues may\nrepresent core aspects of many women\u2019s lives, they do not\nrepresent core issues in Indigenous women\u2019s struggles.\n\nFor instance, the topic of violence is one at the center of feminist\nconcerns of many political persuasions. However, from the perspective\nof Indigenous feminism, violence is not just constructed in terms of\ngendered violence but is also generated by those who have seized and\ndestroyed Indigenous lands (Bastian Duarte 2012: 163). Hence, an\nunderstanding that projects violence solely centered on individuality\nwill not be sufficient to generate conditions of equality for\nIndigenous feminists whose collective identities serve as the primary\nmethod of preserving their cultural systems (Bastian Duarte 2012:\n164). The meaning of equality and justice for Indigenous feminists of\nLatin America and the Caribbean follows the specificity of their\npolitics, which takes the role of the community as central to identity\nand hence calls for new ways of thinking about the relationship\nbetween individual feminist demands and collective transformation\n(Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). Although not all Indigenous peoples of\nLatin America and the Caribbean reside in their own communities as\nmany have migrated to more urban areas, it is important to appreciate\nthe ways in which community in a multifaceted sense operates as an\nimportant feature of transformative projects.\n",
