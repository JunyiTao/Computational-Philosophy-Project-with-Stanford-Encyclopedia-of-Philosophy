Perhaps this\neveryday familiarity is informative enough for our epistemological\ntheorizing. We can do well without looking closely at how human memory\nworks, and the psychology and philosophy here can have a crisp and\nlittle-trafficked border. The epistemology of memory up through the\ntwentieth century often carried on as if this were so. But more\nrecently epistemologists have favored an empirically-informed\napproach.\n",
