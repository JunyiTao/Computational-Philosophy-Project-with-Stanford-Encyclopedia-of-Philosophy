    "main_text": "\n\nThe cosmological argument is less a particular argument than an\nargument type. It uses a general pattern of argumentation\n(logos) that makes an inference from particular alleged facts\nabout the universe (cosmos) to the existence of a unique\nbeing, generally identified with or referred to as God. Among these\ninitial facts are that particular beings or events in the universe are\ncausally dependent or contingent, that the universe (as the totality\nof contingent things) is contingent in that it could have been other\nthan it is or not existed at all, that the Big Conjunctive Contingent\nFact possibly has an explanation, or that the universe came into\nbeing. From these facts philosophers and theologians argue\ndeductively, inductively, or abductively by inference to the best\nexplanation that a first cause, sustaining cause, unmoved mover,\nnecessary being, or personal being (God) exists that caused and/or\nsustains the universe. The cosmological argument is part of classical\nnatural theology, whose goal is to provide evidence for the claim that\nGod exists, although contemporary treatments of it generally occur\noutside of considerations of natural theology but have generated a\ncottage industry of their own.\n\nOn the one hand, the argument arises from human curiosity as to why\nthere is something rather than nothing or than something else. It\ninvokes a concern for some full, complete, ultimate, or best\nexplanation of what exists contingently. On the other hand, it raises\nintrinsically important philosophical questions about contingency and\nnecessity, causation and explanation, part/whole relationships\n(mereology), possible worlds, infinity, sets, the nature of time, and\nthe nature and origin of the universe. In what follows we will first\nsketch out a very brief history of the argument, note the two basic\ntypes of deductive cosmological arguments, and then provide a careful\nanalysis of examples of each: first, three arguments from contingency,\none based on a relatively strong version of the principle of\nsufficient reason and two others based respectively on a very strong\nand on a weak version of that principle; and second, an argument from\nthe alleged fact that the universe had a beginning and the\nimpossibility of an infinite temporal regress of causes. In the end we\nwill consider an inductive version of the cosmological argument and\nwhat it is to be a necessary being.\n",
