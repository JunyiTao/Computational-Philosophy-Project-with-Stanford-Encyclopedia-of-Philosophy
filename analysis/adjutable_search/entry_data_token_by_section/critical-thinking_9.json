    "main_text": "Components of the Process\n6. Components of the Process\n\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\n\nObserving: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\n Weather,\n bubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\n Bubbles,\n a moving blur in the distance in\n Blur,\n a rash in\n Rash).\n Or one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\n Disorder,\n no suction without air pressure in\n Suction pump)\nFeeling: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\n Transit,\n why the diamonds vary in spacing in\n Diamond).\n One wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond).\nWondering: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\n Bubbles,\n how suction pumps work in\n Suction pump,\n what caused the rash in\n Rash).\nImagining: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\n Transit,\n flagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\n Ferryboat,\n allergic reaction or heat rash in\n Rash).\nInferring: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\n Disorder,\n earlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\n Rash).\n Or one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\n Transit,\n burglary in\n Disorder,\n discontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\n Rash).\nKnowledge: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\n Transit,\n of the requirements for a flagpole in\n Ferryboat,\n of Boyle\u2019s law in\n Bubbles,\n of allergic reactions in\n Rash).\nExperimenting: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\n Ferryboat,\n putting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\n Bubbles,\n measuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\n Suction pump,\n noticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\n Diamond).\nConsulting: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\n Candidate\n includes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\n Candidate.\n It is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\n Ferryboat\n that the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\n Transit\n to take the subway.\n\n",
