    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Xunzi: Transforming the People\n2.8 Xunzi: Transforming the People\n\nChapter 19 of the Xunzi contains one of the Warring States\nera\u2019s most famous origin stories.\n\n\nFrom what did ritual (li) arise? I say: Humans are born\nhaving desires. When they have desires but do not get the objects of\ntheir desire, then they cannot but seek some means of satisfaction. If\nthere is no measure or limit to their seeking, then they cannot help\nbut struggle with each other. If they struggle with each other then\nthere will be chaos, and if there is chaos then they will be\nimpoverished. The former kings hated such chaos, so they established\nrituals and rightness in order to establish distinctions among the\npeople, to nurture their desires, and to satisfy their seeking. (XZ\nch. 19, p. 201, slightly modified by author)\n\n\nRitual (li\u2014a different character from that for\n\u201cbenefit\u201d) was important in many chapters of the\nAnalects, but takes on an even more central role here. While\npeople (unlike animals) have the ability to notice and pay heed to\ndistinctions (fen), they will not do so naturally. Their\ndesires have to be shaped through on-going ritual education in order\nfor society to be harmonious and for people to flourish. The text\nexplicitly links ritual with the idea of \u201cstandard\n(fa)\u201d: \u201cTo reject ritual is to be without\nstandards\u201d, and \u201ca man without standards is lost and\nguideless\u201d (XZ ch. 2, p. 14, modified). Unlike the explicit\nregulations for when punishments and rewards are deserved of the\nBook of Lord Shang, that is, the Xunzi takes\nstandards to come through having been taught ritual by an expert\nteacher\u2014by one\u2019s immediate teacher, by one\u2019s ruler,\nand by the sage kings, who originally established the proper set of\nrituals. Both texts seek to exploit features of peoples\u2019\npsychologies to establish order, both in the name of benefiting the\npeople. The central difference, which hearkens back to\nAnalects 2:3, is that the Book of Lord Shang relies\ndirectly on people\u2019s desire for benefit and hatred of harm,\nwhile the Xunzi relies on people\u2019s ability to care\nabout \u201cdistinctions\u201d in order to transform them. Once\ntransformed, ritual propriety and shame, rather than direct concern\nwith benefit, will guide them.\n\nAlthough Xunzi puts considerable emphasis on the role of standards, he\nalso famously argues that \u201cThere are people who create order;\nthere are no standards creating order of themselves\u201d (XZ ch. 12,\np.117, slightly modified). A major theme in Xunzi\u2019s writings is\nthat explicit standards are necessarily vague, so that the proper\nimplementation of them is underdetermined. He also holds that proper\nimplementation of standards requires a great deal of skill and\ntechnique. Furthermore, he notes that standards sometimes appear to\nconflict with one another, and it requires wisdom and experience to\nknow how to balance such competing considerations. Finally, there is\nno fixed way of systematizing the rules. Changes in circumstance\nrequire that the priority of rules will sometimes need to be revised,\nand this too requires good judgment. For all these reasons, Xunzi\ncredits good people with order, not the standards themselves.\n",
