Concepts and Definitions\n\n\nThe philosophical discussion of miracles has focused principally on\nthe credibility of certain claims in the Jewish and Christian\nscriptures. But inquiry into the credibility of specific miracle claims\ninevitably raises questions regarding the concept of a miracle, and\narguments regarding particular claims cannot be evaluated until the\nnature of that concept has been at least reasonably clarified.\n1.1 Miracles as events that exceed the productive power of nature\n\n\nA common approach is to define a miracle as an interruption of the\norder or course of nature (Sherlock 1843: 57). Some stable background\nis, in fact, presupposed by the use of the term, as William Adams\n(1767: 15) notes:\n\n\nAn experienced uniformity in the course of nature hath been always\nthought necessary to the belief and use of miracles. These are indeed\nrelative ideas. There must be an ordinary regular course of nature,\nbefore there can be any thing extraordinary. A river must flow, before\nits stream can be interrupted.\n\n\nAs it stands, however, this definition leaves us wanting a more\nprecise conception of what is meant by the order or course of nature.\nWe might therefore try to tighten the definition by saying that a\nmiracle is an event that exceeds the productive power of nature (St.\nThomas Aquinas, SCG 3.103; ST 1.110, art. 4), where\n\u201cnature\u201d is construed broadly enough to include ourselves\nand any other creatures substantially like ourselves. Variations on\nthis include the idea that a miracle is an event that would have\nhappened only given the intervention of an agent not wholly bound by\nnature (Larmer 1988: 9) and that a miracle is an event that would have\nhappened only if there were a violation of the causal closure of the\nphysical world.\n1.2 Miracles as violations of the laws of nature\n\n\nDavid Hume (Hume 1748/2000; cf. Voltaire 1764/1901: 272) famously\ndefined a miracle as \u201ca violation of the laws of nature,\u201d\nand this definition has been the focus of lively discussion ever since.\nHume evidently means to denote something beyond mere changes in the\nregular course of nature, raising the bar higher for something to\nqualify as a miracle but also raising the potential epistemic\nsignificance of such an event if it could be authenticated.\n\n\nBringing the concept of natural laws into the definition of\n\u201cmiracle\u201d is, however, problematic, and for a variety of\nreasons many writers have found it untenable (Brown 1822:\n219\u201333; Beard 1845: 35; Lias 1890: 5\u20137; Huxley\n1894:154\u201358; Joyce 1914: 17; Hesse 1965; Montgomery 1978; but\nsee Wardlaw 1852: 27\u201341). First, the concept of a miracle\npredates any modern concept of a natural law by many centuries. While\nthis does not necessarily preclude Hume\u2019s concept, it does raise the\nquestion of what concept or concepts earlier thinkers had in mind and\nof why the Humean concept should be thought preferable (Tucker 2005).\nOne benefit of defining miracles in terms of violations of natural law\nis that this definition entails that a miracle is beyond the\nproductive power of nature. But if that is the key idea, then it is\nhard to see why we should not simply use that as the definition and\nleave out the problematic talk of laws.\n\n\nSecond, it becomes difficult to say in some cases just which natural\nlaws are being violated by the event in question (Earman 2000). That\ndead men stay dead is a widely observed fact, but it is not, in the\nordinary scientific use of the term, a law of nature that dead men stay\ndead. The laws involved in the decomposition of a dead body are all at\na much more fundamental level, at least at the level of biochemical and\nthermodynamic processes and perhaps at the level of interactions of\nfundamental particles.\n\n\nThird, there are deep philosophical disagreements regarding the\nnature and even the existence of natural laws. On Hume\u2019s own\n\u201cregularity\u201d view of natural laws, it is difficult to see\nwhat it would mean for a natural law to be violated. If the natural\nlaws are simply compendious statements of natural regularities, an\napparent \u201cviolation\u201d would most naturally be an indication,\nnot that a supernatural intervention in the course of nature had\noccurred, but rather that what we had thought was a natural law was, in\nfact, not one. On metaphysically rich conceptions of natural laws,\nviolations are problematic since the laws involve relations of\nnecessity among universals. And on the view that there are no natural\nlaws whatsoever, the set of events satisfying the Humean definition of\na miracle is, trivially, empty.\n\n\nSpeaking of miracles as violations of the laws of nature\nalso raises questions about the nature of violation. Richard Swinburne\n(1970) has suggested that a miracle might be defined as a\nnon-repeatable counter-instance to a law of nature. If a putative law\nhas broad scope, great explanatory power, and appealing simplicity, it\nmay be more reasonable, Swinburne argues, to retain the law (defined as\na regularity that virtually invariably holds) and to accept that the\nevent in question is a non-repeatable counter-instance of that law than\nto throw out the law and create a vastly more complex law that\naccommodates the event.\n\n\nOne way to get around all of these problems and still retain the\nHumean formulation is simply to redefine the laws of nature. J. L.\nMackie sums up this perspective neatly:\n\n\nThe laws of nature \u2026 describe the ways in which the\nworld\u2014including, of course, human beings\u2014works when left to\nitself, when not interfered with. A miracle occurs when the world is\nnot left to itself, when something distinct from the natural order as a\nwhole intrudes into it. (Mackie 1982: 19\u201320)\n\n\nWith the notion of \u201cnatural law\u201d thus redefined, the\n\u201cviolation\u201d definition becomes virtually equivalent to the\nearlier definition of a miracle as an event that exceeds the productive\npower of nature. And in Mackie\u2019s formulation it has the desirable\nfeature that it makes evident the connection between a miracle and\nsupernatural agency.\n1.3 The relevance of religious context\n\n\nBeyond all of these considerations, some authors have made a case for the\nrestriction of the term \u201cmiracle\u201d to events that are\nsupernaturally caused and have some palpable religious significance. An\ninsignificant shift in a few grains of sand in the lonesome desert\nmight, if it exceeded the productive powers of nature, qualify as a\nmiracle in some thin sense, but it would manifestly lack religious\nsignificance and could not be used as the fulcrum for any interesting\nargument. Considerations such as this have led many authors to build\nboth the type of agency and some intimation of the purpose into the\ndefinition of a miracle. Thus, Samuel Clarke (1719: 311\u201312) writes\nthat\n\n\nthe true Definition of a Miracle, in the\nTheological Sense of the Word, is this; that it is a work\neffected in a manner unusual, or different from the common and\nregular Method of Providence, by the interposition either of God\nhimself, or of some Intelligent Agent superiour to Man, for the Proof\nor Evidence of some particular Doctrine, or in attestation to the\nAuthority of some particular Person.\n\n\nHume also, in one of his definitions of \u201cmiracle,\u201d\nspeaks of an event brought about \u201cby a particular volition of the\nDeity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\u201d (Hume\n1748/2000: 87). Since the paradigmatic cases under discussion are for\nthe most part claims that, if true, would answer to the theological\ndimension of Clarke\u2019s description, one might take a supernatural\ncause to be a necessary condition for an event\u2019s being a\nreligiously significant miracle and use the word \u201cmiracle\u201d\nin this sense where there is no danger of confusion. On the other hand, Basinger (2018: 4) argues that incorporating the condition of supernatural agency into the definition of a miracles would have the awkward consequence that the question of whether an event is considered miraculous would depend upon an individual\u2019s psychological sense; and while such definitions are possible, they are out of the main stream of discussion in the literature on miracles.\n\n\nOn the whole, then, the project of giving a definition for the term\n\u201cmiracle\u201d appears to have reached a point where further refinements offer only diminshing returns. A miracle is an event that\nexceeds the productive power of nature, and a religiously significant\nmiracle is a detectable miracle that has a supernatural cause. For\npractical purposes, we need nothing further. The paradigmatic claims\nunder discussion\u2014that a man who has died was raised to life again\nseveral days after his death, for example, or that water was changed\ninstantaneously into wine\u2014satisfy not only this definition but\nalso most of the alternative proposals that have been seriously\nadvanced.\n2. Arguments for Miracle Claims\n\n\n\u201cMiracles, indeed, would prove something,\u201d admits the\neponymous skeptic in Berkeley\u2019s Alciphron. \u201cBut\nwhat proof have we of these miracles?\u201d (Berkeley 1732/1898: 364) There\nis no lack of answers in the literature. But the variety of premises,\nthe multiplicity of argumentative structures, and the diversity of aims\nemployed to this end can be bewildering.\n\n\nMany arguments for miracles adduce the testimony of sincere and able\neyewitnesses as the key piece of evidence on which the force of the\nargument depends. But other factors are also cited in favor of miracle\nclaims: the existence of commemorative ceremonies from earliest times,\nfor example, or the transformation of the eyewitnesses from fearful\ncowards into defiant proclaimers of the resurrection, or the conversion\nof St. Paul, or the growth of the early church under extremely adverse\nconditions and without any of the normal conditions of success such as\nwealth, patronage, or the use of force. These considerations are often\nused jointly in a cumulative argument. It is therefore difficult to\nisolate a single canonical argument for most miracle claims. The\nvarious arguments must be handled on a case-by-case basis.\n2.1 Categorical and confirmatory arguments\n\n\nTwo dimensions of classification help to bring into focus the nature\nof the various arguments that have been advanced on behalf of miracle\nclaims, one having to do with the aims of the arguments and the other\nhaving to do with their structure.\n\n\nWe may first distinguish between arguments designed to show that\ntheir conclusions are true, reasonable, or justified, on the one hand,\nand arguments designed to show that their conclusions are more\nreasonable or more justified than they were apart from the\nconsiderations adduced. The former we may stipulatively call\ncategorical arguments; the latter, confirmatory\narguments. When the arguments are probabilistic in nature, this reduces\nto Richard Swinburne\u2019s terminology of P-inductive and C-inductive\narguments, the former intending to show that the conclusion (in this\ncase that the miracle in question has actually occurred) is probable to\nsome specific degree, or at least more probable than not, and the\nlatter intending to show that the conclusion is more probable given the\nevidence presented than it is considered independently of that\nevidence (Swinburne, 2004). But the broader distinction between\narguments that purport to command our rational assent and arguments\nthat have the more modest goal of showing their conclusions to be to\nsome (perhaps specified) extent confirmed is one that can be employed\nindependently of the use of the language of probability.\n2.2 Four types of arguments\n\n\nIn addition to this classification of the aims of an argument, there\nis a more common distinction among arguments in terms of their\nstructure. Broadly speaking, most arguments for miracle claims fall\ninto one of four structural categories: deductive, criteriological,\nexplanatory, or probabilistic. A valid deductive argument is one in\nwhich, given the truth of the premises, the conclusion must also be\ntrue. A criteriological argument sets forth some criteria ostensibly\nmet by the claim in question and concludes that the satisfaction of\nthose criteria reflects well on the claim\u2014that it is certain, or\ntrue, or likely to be true, or plausible, or more plausible than it\nwould have been had it not met the criteria. An explanatory argument is\ntypically contrastive: it aims to show, for example, that one\nhypothesis is a better explanation of a certain body of facts than any\nrival hypothesis or than the disjunction of all rival hypotheses. A\nprobabilistic argument aims to show that the conclusion is more\nprobable than not, or that it is more probable than some fixed standard\n(say, 0.99), or that it is far more probable given the evidence adduced\nthan it is considered independent of that evidence.\n\n\nThe latter three categories are not mutually exclusive. An argument\nmay be put forward as criteriological but be best analyzed, on\nreflection, as explanatory; an explanatory argument may be best\nanalyzed in probabilistic terms. But the fourfold classification will\ndo for a first rough sorting.\n2.2.1 Deductive arguments\n\n\nDeductive arguments for miracle claims are relatively rare in\nserious modern discussions, since they are subject to peculiar\nliabilities. Here, for example, is a deductive reconstruction of an\nargument given by William Paley (1859), broadly modeled on the version\ngiven by Richard Whately (1870: 254\u2013258) and other Victorian\nlogicians:\n\nAll miracles attested by persons, claiming to have witnessed\nthem, who pass their lives in labors, dangers, and sufferings in\nsupport of their statements, and who, in consequence of their belief,\nsubmit to new rules of conduct, are worthy of credit.\nThe central Christian miracles are attested by such evidence.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe central Christian miracles are worthy of credit.\n\n\n\nThere are several strategies available for pressing a critique of\nthis argument. In ancient times, premise 2 was generally conceded,\nwhile premise 1 was contested; since the Enlightenment, it has become\nsomewhat more common for critics to contest premise 2 as well. There\nare also indirect approaches that exploit the deductive structure of\nthe argument to argue that something must be wrong with the argument\nwithout getting bogged down in the details of a specific critique.\nAdding further true premises does not reduce the support that a\ndeductive argument gives to its conclusion; but the addition of such\npremises may bring to light some awkward consequences. One\ninterpretation of one part of Hume\u2019s strategy in \u201cOf\nMiracles,\u201d part 2 is that he has in mind the addition of a\nfurther premise:\n\n\n2*. Various non-Christian miracles are attested by such (or better)\nevidence,\n\n\nthe conclusion envisaged being, of course, that\n\n\n3*. Various non-Christian miracles are worthy of credit.\n\n\nThe strategy is intended as a reductio ad absurdum of the\nfirst premise, since prima facie it is not the case that both\nthe Christian miracles and the non-Christian miracles are worthy of\ncredit. Paley does not cast his own argument into a deductive form, but\nhe does attempt to forestall this sort of criticism by adding, in rounding\nout Part 1, an additional claim for which he offers several lines of\nargument:\n[T]here is not satisfactory evidence, that persons\nprofessing to be original witnesses of other miracles, in their nature\nas certain as these are, have ever acted in the same manner, in\nattestation of the accounts which they delivered, and properly in\nconsequence of their belief of those accounts. (Paley 1859: 181)\n\n2.2.2 Criteriological arguments\n\n\nA classic formulation of a criteriological argument for miracles is\nemployed by Charles Leslie (1697/1815: 13), who argues that we may safely\nbelieve an historical claim that meets four criteria:\n\nThat the matters of fact be such, as that men\u2019s outward\nsenses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it.\nThat it be done publicly in the face of the world.\nThat not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but\nsome outward actions to be performed.\nThat such monuments, and such actions or observances, be\ninstituted, and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was\ndone.\n\n\n\nThe first two criteria, Leslie explains, \u201cmake it impossible\nfor any such matter of fact to be imposed upon men, at the time when\nsuch fact was said to be done, because every man\u2019s eyes and\nsenses would contradict it.\u201d The latter two criteria assure those\nwho come afterwards that the account of the event was not invented\nsubsequent to the time of the purported event. Leslie points out that\nthese criteria are not necessary conditions of factual truth, but he\ninsists that they are\u2014taken jointly\u2014sufficient. Hence we\nmay speak of Leslie\u2019s principle: If any reported event meets all\nfour of these criteria, then its historicity is certain.\n\n\nIn assessing a criteriological argument, we need to ask not only\nwhether the event in question meets the criteria but also whether the\ncriteria themselves are good indicators of truth. An argument for the\ncriteria that Leslie gives cannot proceed wholly a priori,\nsince there is not a necessary connection between an event\u2019s\nsatisfying the criteria and its being true. In this case, perhaps the\nmost promising approach would be to argue that the criteria effectively\nrule out explanations other than the truth of the claim. Leslie\u2019s\nremarks suggest that this is the direction he would go if challenged,\nbut he does not offer a fully developed defense of his criteria.\n\n\nLeslie\u2019s argument is, in the sense outlined above,\ncategorical\u2014he holds that, as the claim of the resurrection meets\nall four criteria (the memorials being supplied by the Christian\ncommemoration of the last supper and the transfer of the day of worship\nfrom the Sabbath (Saturday) to the first day of the week (Sunday)), the\ncertainty of the matter of fact in question is\n\u201cdemonstrated.\u201d This rather bold claim opens the\npossibility of refutation of Leslie\u2019s principle by\ncounterexample, though reportedly Conyers Middleton, a contemporary of\nHume whose critique of the ecclesiastical miracles was notable for its\nthoroughness, searched vainly for years for a counterexample to\nLeslie\u2019s principle. Be that as it may, a criteriological argument\nmay also be constructed on the basis of a more modest principle, such\nas that if any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then it\nis reasonable to accept its historicity.\n\n\nThe chief difficulty with criteriological arguments, whether bold or\nmodest, is that they provide no means for taking into account any other\nconsiderations that might weigh against the historical claim in\nquestion. Intuitively, extreme antecedent improbability ought to carry\nsome weight in our evaluation of the credibility of a factual claim. A\ndefender of a criteriological argument might respond that so long as\nthe bar is set high enough, antecedent improbability will be\noverwhelmed by the fact that the event does indeed meet the stipulated\ncriteria. But this is a claim that requires argument; and the bolder\nthe conclusion, the more argument it requires.\n2.2.3 Explanatory arguments\n\n\nA third approach to arguing for a miracle claim is to argue that it\nis the best explanation for a small set of widely conceded facts. A\ntypical \u201cminimal facts\u201d argument for the resurrection of\nJesus starts with a list of facts such as these (Habermas 1996:\n162):\n\nJesus died by crucifixion.\nHis disciples subsequently had experiences which they believed\nwere literal physical appearances of the risen Jesus.\nThe disciples were transformed from fearful cowards into bold\nproclaimers who were willing to face persecution and death for their\nmessage.\nPaul, who had previously been a persecutor of the Christians, had\nan experience that he also believed was an appearance of the risen\nJesus.\n\n\n\nNone of these four facts is, in itself, a supernatural claim, and\nvirtually all critical scholars with relevant expertise concur in these\nfacts on ordinary historical grounds. The explanatory argument starts\nwith this scholarly consensus and contends that all alternative\nexplanations for these facts are inferior to the explanation that Jesus\nactually did rise from the dead. The conclusion is therefore typically\ncategorical.\n\n\nOne advantage of this approach over the criteriological approach is\nthat the inference is explicitly contrastive: the argument engages\ndirectly with alternative explanations of the data. Such engagement\nbrings with it the burden of examining a variety of alternative\nexplanations, a burden that is sometimes discharged by reference to\nestablished criteria of historical explanation (Craig 2008: 233).\n\n\nThis sort of explanatory argument may be contested in at least five\nways, a number of which have been explored. First, one might try, the\nscholarly consensus notwithstanding, to dispute the facts asserted.\n(Crossan, in Copan 1998) If successful, this strategy would undermine\nthe positive argument. Second, one might grant, if only for the sake of\nthe argument, the prima facie force of the positive argument\nbut attempt to neutralize it by widening the factual basis to include a\nmatching set of facts, equally well attested, for which the\nfalsehood of the resurrection account is the best explanation.\nThird, one might argue that the relative merits of the miraculous and\nnon-miraculous explanations have been improperly assessed and that,\nrightly considered, one or more of the non-miraculous explanations is\nactually preferable as an explanation of the facts in question.\n(L\u00fcdemann, in Copan and Tacelli 2000) Fourth, one might produce a\nnon-miraculous explanation not addressed in the explanatory argument\nand argue that it is superior to the miraculous explanation (Venturini\n1800; cf. O\u2019Collins and Kendall 1996). Fifth, one might contest\nthe implication that an explanation that is superior to its rivals in\npairwise comparisons is actually more reasonable to believe than not.\nIt is not difficult to imagine (or even to find) cases where one\nexplanation is marginally better than any given rival but where the\ndisjunction of the rival explanations is more believable. This final\ncriticism applies only when the explanatory argument is categorical;\nbut in that case, a further argument would be necessary to close off\nthis line of criticism.\n2.2.4 Probabilistic arguments\n\n\nA fourth method of arguing for a miracle claim is to employ the\nmachinery of Bayesian probability and argue that some fact or set of\nfacts renders the conclusion probable (for a categorical argument) or\nsignificantly more probable than it was taken apart from those facts\n(for a confirmatory one). The argument could be cast in categorical\nform using the odds form of Bayes\u2019s Theorem. It is a simple\nconsequence of Bayes\u2019s Theorem that, where \u2018\\(M\\)\u2019 is\nthe claim that a miracle has taken place and \u2018\\(E\\)\u2019\nis some evidence bearing on that claim, and where all of the relevant\nterms are defined,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(M\\mid E)}{P({\\sim}M\\mid E)} = \n \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \\frac{P(E\\mid M)}{P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nVerbally, this says that the posterior odds on \\(M\\) (that is,\nthe ratio of the posterior probability of \\(M\\) to the posterior\nprobability of its negation) equal the product of the prior odds and\nthe Bayes factor. More colloquially, \\(M\\) becomes more\nplausible when we take into account evidence \\(E\\) that is more\nto be expected if \\(M\\) is true than if \\(M\\) is false. A\ncategorical argument of this sort would involve plugging in values\n(either point-valued or interval-valued) for each term in this\nequation and concluding that \\(P(M\\mid E)\n\\gt k\\), where \\(k\\) is some constant with a value\ngreater than or equal to 0.5. The evaluation of such an argument is\nlikely to turn principally on the relative magnitudes of \\(P(M)\\) and\n\\(P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\), since in many contexts the\ndisputants will grant that the other two probabilities that appear on\nthe right side of the equation\u2014\\(P({\\sim}M)\\)\nand \\(P(E\\mid M)\\)\u2014are very close to 1. A\nconfirmatory probabilistic argument might proceed from the same\npremises but dispense with the ratio of the priors, focusing on the\nfact that the ratio \\(P(E\\mid M)/P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\)\nis top heavy.\n\n\nThe equation may give the impression that what is going on is rather\narcane. In fact, the mathematics is simply a means of making explicit a\ncommon process of reasoning described well by Joseph Butler (1736/1819:\n194):\n\n\n[T]he truth of our religion, like the truth of common matters, is to\nbe judged of by all the evidence taken together. And unless the whole\nseries of things which may be alleged in this argument, and every\nparticular thing in it, can reasonably be supposed to have been by\naccident (for here the stress of the argument for Christianity lies);\nthen is the truth of it proved: in like manner, as if in any common\ncase, numerous events acknowledged, were to be alleged in proof of any\nother event disputed; the truth of the disputed event would be proved,\nnot only if any one of the acknowledged ones did of itself clearly\nimply it but, though no one of them singly did so, if the whole of the\nacknowledged events taken together could not in reason be supposed to\nhave happened, unless the disputed one were true.\n\n\nAllowing for the change in terminology over the centuries,\nButler\u2019s description can be read as a verbal explication of the\ncategorical form of the Bayesian argument. If the facts can be\naccounted for without difficulty on the supposition of \\(M\\) but\nnot, without great implausibility, on the assumption of \\({\\sim}M\\),\nthen they provide significant evidence in favor of \\(M\\). On this\nreading, Butler is tacitly assuming that the prior probability\nof \\(M\\) is not so low as to overcome the cumulative force of the\nevidence in its favor.\n\n\nHistorically, probabilistic arguments for miracles have centered on\nthe credibility of eyewitness testimony to the miraculous. Where\n\\(T_i (M)\\) stands for\n\u201cWitness \\(i\\) testifies that \\(M\\),\u201d we may\nwrite the relevant form of Bayes\u2019s Theorem as\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{P(M\\mid T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots\\amp T_n (M))}{P({\\sim}M\\mid T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M))} = \\\\\n&\\qquad \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \n \\frac{P(T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nIf we assume that these testimonies are independent of each other\nrelative both to \\(M\\) and to \\({\\sim}M\\)\u2014an assumption that should not be\nmade casually (Kruskal 1988)\u2014we can replace the final term on the\nright with the product\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)} \\times \\ldots \\times \n \\frac{P(T_n (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_n (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nOn the further simplifying assumption that all of the testimonies\nare of equal weight, this product reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\frac{P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\\right]^n\n\\]\n\n\n\nIf \\(P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)/P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M) \\gt 1\\), it follows at\nonce that the claim, arguably attributable to Hume, that the evidence\nof testimony can never overcome the antecedent presumption against a\nmiracle, is false. As Charles Babbage puts it:\n\n\n[I]f independent witnesses can be found, who speak truth more\nfrequently than falsehood, it is ALWAYS possible to assign\na number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the falsehood\nof whose concurring testimony shall be greater than the improbability\nof the alleged miracle. (Babbage 1837: 202, emphasis original; cf.\nHolder 1998 and Earman 2000)\n\n\n\n\nAhmed (2015) argues that the anti-Humean argument leveled by Babbage\n(1837), Holder (1999), and Earman (2000) requires an assumption of the\nconditional independence of successive testimonies to the putative\nevent, an assumption that is plausibly always violated both\nconditional on the assumption of its truth and conditional on the\nassumption of its falsehood. In the abstract to his article, Ahmed\nsummarizes his point by saying that \u201ceven multiple reports from\nnon-collusive witnesses lack the sort of independence that could make\ntrouble for Hume.\u201d This enthusiastic promise is tempered,\nhowever, by Ahmed\u2019s recognition later in the same article that\nsomething very much like the same critique can be leveled granting\nthat conditional independence fails in both cases, provided that the\nratio of the likelihoods does not converge to 1 too quickly. So in his\nown summary, his arguments \u201cdo not after all realize the\n\u2018everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion\u2019\nthat Hume envisaged\u201d (Ahmed 2015: 1042).\n\n\nThe evaluation of a serious cumulative argument for a particular\nmiracle claim requires the consideration of historical details that go\nbeyond the bounds of philosophy as a discipline (McGrew and McGrew\n2009). But some general points regarding its structure are of\nphilosophical interest. If the argument is categorical, then its\nconclusion is (at least) that, where \u201c\\(E\\)\u201d stands for\nthe sum of the relevant evidence, \\(P(M\\mid E) \\gt 0.5\\). But where\n\u201c\\(G\\)\u201d stands for \u201cGod exists\u201d (where\n\u201cGod\u201d is conceived classically, as an eternal, personal\nbeing of maximal power, knowledge, and goodness who created the\nuniverse), it is generally acknowledged that \\(P(M\\mid G) \\gg\nP(M\\mid {\\sim}G)\\) and that either \\(P(M\\mid {\\sim}G) = 0\\) (if\nmiracles are strictly the prerogative of God) or at least \\(P(M\\mid\n{\\sim}G) \\approx 0\\). The evaluation of the claim that a miracle has\noccurred will therefore be sensitive to the probability of the claim\nthat God exists, and the evaluation of the categorical form of the\nargument will therefore depend on the overall evaluation of the\nevidence of natural theology and of atheological arguments such as the\nproblem of evil. By far the most sophisticated and elaborate\ndevelopment of such an argument is to be found in the work of Richard\nSwinburne (1970, 1977, 1979, 1992, 2003), who has pioneered the\napplication of Bayesian probability to questions in the philosophy of\nreligion and whose work spans the full range of natural theology.\n\n\nThe confirmatory form of the probabilistic argument is more modest;\nit aims to show that there is a considerable contribution to the\nargument for \\(M\\) arising from the facts indicated (McGrew and McGrew\n2009). It has been objected (Oppy 2006: 5\u20136) that probabilistic\narguments of this sort are of no interest unless they are founded on\nall of the relevant available evidence. But this objection\nwould, if legitimate, count equally against the use of arguments from\ncomparison of likelihoods in scientific reasoning, where they are\nubiquitous. More cautiously, one might ask why an argument that places\nno definite restrictions on the probability of \\(M\\) should be of\nany interest. One answer would be that a successful confirmatory\nargument may shift the burden of proof. If there is a substantial body\nof evidence in favor of \\(M\\), it is incumbent on those who\ndeny \\(M\\) to explain in some detail either (1) why the\nantecedent presumption against \\(M\\) should override this\nevidence or (2) what the other evidential considerations are that\nmitigate against \\(M\\).\n3. Arguments against Miracle Claims\n\n\nArguments against miracle claims, like arguments in their favor,\ncome in a variety of forms, invoke diverse premises, and have distinct\naims. We may distinguish general arguments, designed to show that all\nmiracle claims are subject in principle to certain failings, from\nparticular arguments, designed to show that, whatever may be the case\nin principle, such miracle claims as have historically been offered are\ninadequately supported.\n3.1 General arguments\n\n\nGeneral arguments against miracle claims fall into two broad\nclasses: those designed to show that miracles are impossible, and those\ndesigned to show that miracle claims could never be believable.\n3.1.1 Arguments that miracles are impossible\n\n\nThe boldest claim that could be made against reported miracles is\nthat such events are impossible. Insofar as the definition of\n\u201cmiracle\u201d in question is one that involves divine agency,\nany argument that demonstrated the non-existence of God would be eo\nipso a demonstration that miracles do not take place; and an\nargument that demonstrated that the existence of God is impossible\nwould demonstrate that miracles are likewise impossible. But the more\ncommon arguments for this conclusion are more modest; rather than\nsetting out to show the existence of God to be impossible, they\ntypically invoke theological premises to show that if there were a God,\nthen miracles would not occur.\n\n\nIn chapter 6 of his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Baruch\nSpinoza sets out to argue for the claim that nature cannot be\ncontravened, but that she \u201cpreserves a fixed and immutable\ncourse,\u201d in consequence of which a miracle is \u201ca sheer\nabsurdity\u201d (Spinoza 1670/1862: 123, 128). His argument for this\nclaim is somewhat difficult to follow, but it appears to run\napproximately like this:\n\nThe will of God is identical with the laws of nature.\nA miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.\nNecessarily, God\u2019s will is inviolable.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nMiracles cannot happen.\n\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s argument is unlikely to persuade anyone who does not\nstart out with his identification of the laws of nature with the will\nof God. From a more traditional theistic standpoint, the argument is\nsimply an elaborate exercise in begging the question.\n\n\nA non-theological version of this argument, sometimes mistakenly\nattributed to Hume, is actually due to Voltaire (1764/1901: 272):\n\n\nA miracle is the violation of mathematical, divine, immutable,\neternal laws. By the very exposition itself, a miracle is a\ncontradiction in terms: a law cannot at the same time be immutable and\nviolated.\n\n\nThe trouble with this crude argument is once again in the definition\nof \u201cmiracle,\u201d which here goes beyond a mere violation\nconcept in adding immutability, which generates the contradiction. One\nretort that historically proved attractive is to accept the violation\nconcept but deny that the laws of nature are immutable; instead the\ntruly immutable laws are higher laws\u2014laws that govern not only\nthe behavior of physical entities but the interactions of physical and\nnon-physical entities\u2014and what appear to us to be violations of\nthe laws of nature are really nothing less than instances of a higher\nlaw (Trench 1847:14\u201317; cf. Venn 1888: 433 ff).\n\n\nA more subtle version of a theological objection can also be found\nin the entry \u201cMiracles\u201d in Voltaire\u2019s\nPhilosophical Dictionary (1764/1901: 273):\n\n\n[I]t is impossible a being infinitely wise can have made laws to\nviolate them. He could not \u2026 derange the machine but with a view\nof making it work better; but it is evident that God, all-wise and\nomnipotent, originally made this immense machine, the universe, as good\nand perfect as He was able; if He saw that some imperfections would\narise from the nature of matter, He provided for that in the beginning;\nand, accordingly, He will never change anything in it.\n\n\nIt is therefore impious to ascribe miracles to God; they would\nindicate a lack of forethought, or of power, or both.\n\n\nThis argument was popular during the deist controversy of the early\nand mid 18th century, and the orthodox response is summed up well by\nPaley (1859: 12): \u201c[I]n what way can a revelation be made but by\nmiracles? In none which we are able to conceive.\u201d Paley\u2019s\npoint is not merely negative; rather, it is that only by setting up a\nuniverse with regularities that no mere human can abrogate and then\nsuspending them could God, if there were a God, authenticate a\nrevelation, stamping it with divine approval by an act of sovereignty.\nIf there is a God who wishes to authenticate a communication to man in\nan unmistakable fashion, then, in Paley\u2019s view, an authenticating\nmiracle is inevitable. It is therefore not at all impious to\nascribe miracles to God, and they imply no limit either on His\nknowledge or on His power; they are both a sign of His approval and\nevidence of His benevolent foresight.\n3.1.2 Arguments that miracle claims could never be rationally believed\n\n\nThe principal argument against the rational credibility of miracle\nclaims derives from Hume. \u201cA miracle,\u201d he writes,\n\n\nis a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable\nexperience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle,\nfrom the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from\nexperience can possibly be imagined. (Hume 1748/2000:\n86\u201387)\n\n\n\n\nHe ends the first Part of his essay \u201cOf Miracles\u201d with a\ngeneral maxim:\n\n\nThe plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our\nattention), \u201cThat no testimony is sufficient to establish a\nmiracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood\nwould be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to\nestablish: And even in that case, there is a mutual destruction of\narguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that\ndegree of force, which remains, after deducting the\ninferior.\u201d\n\n\nThe maxim itself is open to interpretive disputes. George Campbell\n(1762/1839) considers it to be trivial, a judgment with which Earman\n(2000) concurs. One simple way to arrive at it from a Bayesian point of\nview is to take the initial equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(M\\mid E)}{P({\\sim}M\\mid E)} = \n  \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \\frac{P(E\\mid M)}{P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)},\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the proposed evidence for a miracle, and make the\nsimplifying approximation that \\(P(E\\mid M) \\approx P({\\sim}M)\\),\nsince both terms are close to 1. Then the right side reduces to the\nratio of the two remaining \u201csmall\u201d terms, \\(P(M)/P(E\\mid\n{\\sim}M)\\), which will be a fair approximation of the posterior\nodds. Then the posterior probability of M will exceed 0.5 just in case\n\\(P(M) \\gt P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\). This interpretation is endorsed by\nHolder (1998) but challenged by Millican (2002), who also surveys\nvarious other probabilistic interpretations of Hume\u2019s maxim.\n\n\nMillican (2011) argues that many interpreters of Hume have overlooked a critical distinction between a type of testimony and a token of that testimony, where the latter is a particular instance of testimony asserting the occurrence of one particular event. Under the token interpretation, Millican grants, Hume\u2019s maxim would be trivial. But on the former interpretation, all testimony belongs to a type that has a characteristic or typical probability of falsehood. According to Millican, it is that typical probability that Hume has in view when constructing his maxim rather than the particular probability of falsehood of a specific piece of evidence.\n\n\nHume immediately illustrates this maxim by applying it to the case\nof testimony to a resurrection:\n\n\nWhen anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I\nimmediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that\nthis person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact,\nwhich he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle\nagainst the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover,\nI pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the\nfalsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event\nwhich he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my\nbelief or opinion. (Hume 1748/2000: 87\u201388)\n\n\n\n\nIs this an argument, or even an elliptical statement of one premise in\nan argument? And if so, what is its structure? The traditional\ninterpretation has been that it is an argument from the nature of the\ncase, the conclusion being that a miracle story could not be believed\non testimony even under the most favorable circumstances. As far as we\ncan tell, all of Hume\u2019s contemporaries, including John Leland (1755),\nWilliam Adams (1767), Richard Price (1777), and George Campbell\n(1762/1839), read him this way. There is, however, considerable recent\ndisagreement as to whether Hume intended Part 1 of his essay as an\nargument, disagreement that arises in part from the apprehension on\nthe part of some of Hume\u2019s defenders that if it is an argument, it is\nnot very good. The interpretive issues are too extensive to summarize;\nsee Flew (1961), Levine (1989: 152), Johnson (1999), Earman (2000),\nFogelin (2003), McGrew (2005), and H\u00e1jek (2008). But it is\nbeyond contesting that some such argument, widely attributed to Hume,\nhas been tremendously influential.\n\n\nA very simple version of the argument, leaving out the comparison to\nthe laws of nature and focusing on the alleged infirmities of\ntestimony, can be laid out deductively (following Whately, in Paley\n1859: 33):\n\nTestimony is a kind of evidence very likely to be false.\nThe evidence for the Christian miracles is testimony.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe evidence for the Christian miracles is likely to be\nfalse.\n\n\n\nThis is, however, much too crude an argument to carry any weight,\nsince it turns on a simple ambiguity between all testimony and\nsome testimony. Whately offers an amusing parody that makes\nthe fallacy obvious: Some books are mere trash; Hume\u2019s Works are\n[some] books; therefore, etc.\n\n\nAnother crude argument that focuses solely on the improbability of\nmiracle claims (Ehrman 2003: 228\u2013229) may be laid out thus:\n\nA miracle is by definition the most improbable of events; the\nprobability of a miracle is infinitesimally remote.\nAn historian can establish only what probably happened in the\npast.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nAn historian can never establish that a miracle happened.\n\n\n\nWaiving the tendentious definition in premise 1, the supposed\ncontradiction involved in denying the conclusion\u2014\u201cthat the\nmost improbable event is the most probable\u201d (Ehrman 2003:\n229)\u2014is merely verbal, arising from a failure to distinguish\nbetween the probability of a miracle claim considered apart from the\nevidence and the probability of the claim given that evidence.\n\n\nFlew (1966: 146; cf. Bradley 1874/1935) offers a more sophisticated\ncriticism, arguing from the nature of historical inquiry that rational\nbelief in miracles is precluded:\n\n\nThe basic propositions are: first, that the present relics of the\npast cannot be interpreted as historical evidence at all, unless we\npresume that the same fundamental regularities obtained then as still\nobtain today; second, that in trying as best he may to determine what\nactually happened the historian must employ as criteria all his present\nknowledge, or presumed knowledge, of what is probable or improbable,\npossible or impossible; and, third, that, since miracle has to be\ndefined in terms of practical impossibility the application of these\ncriteria inevitably precludes proof of a miracle.\n\n\nThe most obvious rejoinder here is that the believer in miracles\ndoes not generally believe that there are no dependable regularities in\nthe physical world; it is in the nature of a miracle to be an exception\nto the ordinary course of nature. The feared undermining of the\nprinciples of historical inquiry is therefore an illusion generated by\nexaggerating the scale on which the order of nature would be disrupted\nwere a miracle actually to occur.\n\n\nAn alternative reading of Hume, proposed by Dorothy Coleman (1988:\n338\u2013339), is that\n\n\nan event that has no ready natural explanation is not necessarily an\nevent that has no natural cause. To be a miracle, an event must be\ninexplicable not in terms of what appears to us to be the laws of\nnature but in terms of what laws of nature actually are\u2026. [O]ne\nmust ask if it is always more likely, i.e., conformable to experience,\nthat those claiming the event to be a miracle are mistaken rather than\nthat the event is a genuine violation of a law of nature.\nCounterinstances of what are taken to be natural laws are not by\nthemselves evidence establishing that no natural law could possibly\nexplain them: at most they provide grounds for revising our\nformulations of natural laws or seeking an improved understanding of\nthe nature of the phenomena in question. At the very least they provide\ngrounds for suspending judgments about the nature of their cause until\nmore evidence is available. On the other hand, past experience shows\nthat what are at one time considered violations of natural laws are\nfrequently found at some later time not to be so. Proportioning belief\nto evidence, therefore, it is more reasonable to believe that the claim\nthat an event is a miracle is mistaken than it is that the event is a\nviolation of natural law.\n\n\nThere is not much to commend this line of argument as a reading of\nHume; both the casual attitude toward our identification of the laws of\nnature and the willingness to grant the occurrence of the event jar\nwith Hume\u2019s own presentation of his view. As Hajek (2008: 86\u201387)\nstresses, Hume is unambiguously arguing that we should\ndisbelieve testimony to an event\u2019s occurrence, when that\nevent really would be miraculous.\n\n\nAs an independent objection to belief in reported miracles,\nColeman\u2019s argument has limited force. On a ceteris\nparibus conception of natural laws, apparent counterevidence to a\nputative law may, depending on circumstances, reduce the probability of\nthe law only slightly, the majority of the impact of the evidence going\nto raise the probability that all else is not, in the present case,\nequal. There is no general principle that would license the conclusion\nthat it is more reasonable to accept the falsehood of the putative law\nthan to suppose the causal closure of nature to be violated. Everything\ndepends on the details of specific cases.\n\n\nA more faithful representation of Hume\u2019s reasoning brings back\nin the comparison between \u201ctwo opposite experiences,\u201d\nreconstructing his argument along these lines:\n\nThe argument against a miracle,\nfrom the nature of the case, is as strong as any argument from\nexperience could possibly be.\nThe argument for a miracle, from\ntestimony, is at best a strong but somewhat weaker argument from\nexperience.\nIn any case where two arguments\nfrom experience point to contradictory conclusions, the stronger\nargument must prevail.\nA conclusion is credible only if\nthe argument supporting it is not overcome by a stronger argument for a\ncontradictory conclusion.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe argument for a miracle, from\ntestimony, cannot even under the most favorable circumstances render\nbelief in a miracle credible.\n\n\n\nHume\u2019s early critics objected vigorously to the claims\nembodied in the first two premises. Price (1777: 402; cf. Adams 1767:\n10\u201311 and Paley 1859: 13\u201314) retorts against the claim in premise 1\nthat \u201ca miracle is more properly an event different from\nexperience than contrary to it.\u201d The presumptive case against the\nresurrection from universal testimony would be as strong as Hume\nsupposes only if, per impossible, all mankind throughout all\nages had been watching the tomb of Jesus on the morning of the third\nday and testified that nothing occurred. Even aside from the problems\nof time travel, there is not a single piece of direct\ntestimonial evidence to Jesus\u2019 non-resurrection. Premise 1 is\ntherefore a wild overstatement.\n\n\nAdams (1767: 37) mounts an attack on premise 2 by drawing attention\nto the manner in which the lives of the apostles corroborate their\ntestimony:\n\n\nThat men should love falshood rather than truth\u2014that they\nshould chuse labour and travail, shame and misery, before pleasure,\nease, and esteem\u2014is as much a violation of the laws of nature, as\nit is for lead or iron to hang unsupported in the air, or for the voice\nof a man to raise the dead to life: but this, I have granted to the\nauthor, is, not miraculous, but impossible, and shall therefore have\nhis leave, I hope, to assert, that falshood, thus attested, is\nimpossible\u2014in other words, that testimony, thus tried and proved,\nis infallible and certain.\n\n\nAnd he drives home the point by a quotation from Hume himself:\n\n\nWe cannot make use of a more convincing argument, than to prove that\nthe actions ascribed to any person are directly contrary to the course\nof nature, and that no human motives, in such circumstances, could\never induce him to such a conduct. (Adams 1767: 48, quoting Hume\n1748/2000: 65)\n\n\n\n\nThis argument, of course, proves at best only the sincerity of the\nwitnesses. But in the present case, he goes on to argue, the nature of\nthe facts attested precludes the possibility that the witnesses are\nthemselves deceived (Adams 1767:37\u201338; cf. Jenkin 1708: 488\u201393).\n\n\nAlan H\u00e1jek (2008: 88) offers a more detailed reconstruction\nof this argument. The first stage corresponds to the argument in\n\u201cOf Miracles,\u201d Part I:\n\nA miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.\nA law of nature is, inter alia, a regularity to which no\nexception has previously been experienced.\n\nThus,\n\nThere is as compelling a \u2018proof\u2019 from experience as\ncan possibly be imagined against a miracle.\nIn particular, the proof from experience in favour of testimony\nof any kind cannot be more compelling.\nThere is no other form of proof in favour of testimony.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe falsehood of the testimony to a miraculous event is always at\nleast as probable as the event attested to (however good the testimony\nseems to be).\n\nHowever,\n\nHume\u2019s balancing principle. The testimony should\nbe believed if, and only if, the falsehood of the testimony is less\nprobable than the event attested to.\n\n\n\nTherefore, (by 7 and 8):\n\nConclusion 1. Testimony to a miraculous event should never be\nbelieved\u2014belief in a miracle report could never be justified.\n\n\n\nH\u00e1jek makes a strong case that this is a faithful\nreconstruction of Hume\u2019s reasoning. But as he goes on to point\nout, this argument is problematic at multiple points. The definition in\n1 is at the least not forced upon us; and the inference from 1 and 2 to\n3 overlooks the possibility that a regularity to which no\nexception has previously been experienced is also a\nregularity of which no instance has previously been\nexperienced\u2014a possibility that is countenanced on some major\nconceptions of laws\u2014or that the law in question has not been\ninstanced very often (H\u00e1jek 2008: 91). Hume might reply that,\nwhile this is theoretically possible, it does not hold in the cases of\ninterest. But even granting that reply, H\u00e1jek points out that 5\nmay be questioned; and 6 is deeply problematic, since lack of analogy\nis at best an obscure reason for concluding that an event is maximally\nimprobable. For if strength of analogy is a critical determinant in a\nrational agent\u2019s probability function, then he should be comparably\nskeptical regarding all spectacular scientific\ndiscoveries\u2014\u201cAnd that is absurd\u201d (H\u00e1jek\n2008: 103).\n\n\nLarmer (2013) surveys a wide range of in-principle objections to justified belief in miracle claims in general and argues that all of them fail to deliver the promised conclusion.\n3.2 Particular arguments\n\n\nBecause the field of arguments for miracles is so wide, a\nconsideration of all of the criticisms that have been leveled against\nparticular arguments for miracles would fill many volumes. But four\nparticular arguments raised by Hume are sufficiently well known to be\nof interest to philosophers.\n\n\nIn Part 2 of his essay \u201cOf Miracles,\u201d Hume argues that\nthere never was a miraculous event established on evidence so full as\nto amount to an \u201centire proof.\u201d The considerations Hume\nmarshals in this section had, for the most part, been canvassed\nthoroughly during the deist controversy in the preceeding half century;\nHume\u2019s credit in this Part is not that of originating the\narguments but rather that of stating them clearly and forcefully.\n3.2.1 The argument from inauspicious conditions\n\n\nFirst, Hume lists a set of conditions that would, in his view, be\nnecessary in order for an argument from testimony to have its full\nforce, and he argues that no miracle report has ever met these\nconditions:\n\n\n[T]here is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by\na sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education,\nand learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of\nsuch undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any\ndesign to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of\nmankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being\ndetected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts,\nperformed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the\nworld, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances\nare requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.\n(Hume 1748/2000: 88)\n\n\nHume does not elaborate on these conditions, and it is difficult to\nsay how he might have responded to Leland\u2019s charge that they are\nnot necessary and would in some cases cut the other direction. For\nexample, Leland argues that meeting the condition of \u201ccredit and\nreputation\u201d would actually have weakened the evidence for the\nChristian miracles:\n\n\nIt might have been said with some shew of plausibility, that such\npersons by their knowledge and abilities, their reputation and\ninterest, might have it in their power to countenance and propagate an\nimposture among the people, and give it some credit in the world.\n(Leland 1755: 90\u201391; cf. Beckett 1883: 29\u201337)\n3.2.2 The argument from the passions of surprise and wonder\n\n\nThomas Morgan (1739: 31) raises a second charge in these words:\n\n\nMen are the more easily imposed on in such Matters, as they love to\ngratify the Passion of Admiration, and take a great deal of\nPleasure in hearing or telling of Wonders.\n\n\nThe implication is twofold: miracle stories are more likely than\nother falsehoods to be told, since they cater to a natural\nhuman desire to be amazed; and they are more likely than other\nfalsehoods to be believed, since the same passions conduce to\ntheir uncritical reception. Hume, perhaps following Morgan, makes much\nthe same point in nearly the same words. But he goes beyond Morgan in\nspecifying a further exacerbating factor: the religious context of a\nmiracle claim, he urges, makes the telling of a miracle story even more\nlikely.\n\n\n[I]f the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder, there\nis an end of common sense; and human testimony, in these circumstances,\nloses all pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast,\nand imagine he sees what has no reality: He may know his narrative to\nbe false, and yet persevere in it, with the best intentions in the\nworld, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause: Or even where this\ndelusion has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation,\noperates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any\nother circumstances; and self-interest with equal force. (Hume\n1748/2000: 89)\n\n\n\n\nBut as George Campbell points out (1762/1839: 48\u201349), this\nconsideration cuts both ways; the religious nature of the claim may\nalso operate to make it less readily received:\n\n\n[T]he prejudice resulting from the religious affection, may just as\nreadily obstruct as promote our faith in a religious\nmiracle. What things in nature are more contrary, than one religion is\nto another religion? They are just as contrary as light and darkness,\ntruth and error. The affections with which they are contemplated by the\nsame person, are just as opposite as desire and aversion, love and\nhatred. The same religious zeal which gives the mind of a Christian a\npropensity to the belief of a miracle in support of\nChristianity, will inspire him with an aversion from the\nbelief of a miracle in support of Mahometanism. The same principle\nwhich will make him acquiesce in evidence less than sufficient\nin one case, will make him require evidence more than\nsufficient in the other\u2026.\n\n\n\u2026 [T]hat the evidence arising from miracles performed in proof\nof a doctrine disbelieved, and consequently hated before, did in fact\nsurmount that obstacle, and conquer all the opposition arising thence,\nis a very strong presumption in favour of that evidence; just as strong\na presumption in its favour, as it would have been against it, had all\ntheir former zeal, and principles, and prejudices, co-operated with the\nevidence, whatever it was, in gaining an entire assent.\n\n\n\nMoreover, as Campbell (1762/1839: 49) immediately points out,\n\n\nthere is the greatest disparity in this respect, a disparity which\ndeserves to be particularly attended to, betwixt the evidence of\nmiracles performed in proof of a religion to be established,\nand in contradiction to opinions generally received; and the\nevidence of miracles performed in support of a religion\nalready established, and in confirmation of opinions\ngenerally received.\n\n\nIt is, therefore, a debatable question whether the consideration of\nthe passions evoked by tales of the miraculous works for or against the\nmiracle claim in any given instance. This is not an issue that can be\nsettled in advance of a detailed consideration of the facts.\n3.2.3 The argument from ignorance and barbarism\n\n\nA third general argument is that miracle stories are most popular in\nbackward cultures. As John Toland (1702: 148) puts it,\n\n\nit is very observable, that the more ignorant and barbarous any\nPeople remain, you shall find \u2019em most abound with Tales of this\nnature \u2026\n\n\nThe unstated moral to be drawn is that both the production and the\nreception of miracle stories are due to a failure to understand the\nsecondary causes lying behind phenomena, while increasing knowledge and\nculture leaves no room for such stories. Hume (2000: 90\u201391) also\nborrowed this line of reasoning.\n\n\nBut the supposed trajectory of societies from ignorant superstition\nto enlightened rationalism owes a good deal more to selective\nillustration than one would suspect from reading Toland and Hume.\nCampbell (1762/1839: 70) points out that in the Qur\u2019an\nMohammed made no claim to work public miracles, though by\nToland\u2019s (and Hume\u2019s) reasoning the circumstances would\nhave been most propitious for such tales. Coming forward in time,\nmiracle stories abounded in the 18th century, as Hume well knew. And\nrenowned scientists such as Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle were well\nknown defenders of the Christian miracle claims. Other forces are at\nwork in the creation and acceptance of miracle stories besides the\nrelative level of civilization and education.\n3.2.4 The argument from parity\n\n\nAs a fourth and final argument, Hume sketches some accounts of\npurported miracles outside of the canonical Christian\nscriptures\u2014two cures ascribed to Vespasian, one Catholic miracle\nreported to have been worked at Saragossa, and some cures ascribed to\nthe influence of the tomb of the Jansenist Abbe Paris in the early\n1700s\u2014and suggests that their affidavits are in various respects\nas good as one could wish for. Hume clearly expects his Protestant\nreaders to reject these stories with disdain. He leaves unstated the\nobvious conclusion: by parity, his readers should also reject the\nmiracles of the New Testament.\n\n\nSetting Protestants and Catholics by the ears over the miracles of\nlater ecclesiastical history was an old game by Hume\u2019s time, and\na small industry had grown up on the Protestant side providing criteria\nfor sifting the genuine apostolic miracles from their Catholic\ncounterfeits (Leslie 1697/1815, Douglas 1757, Warfield 1918). Hume\u2019s\ncontemporary critics rose to the challenge and argued vigorously that\nhis descriptions of the alleged \u201cmiracles,\u201d Pagan,\nCatholic, and Jansenist, distorted the historical sources and were\nhopelessly one sided (Leland 1755: 102 ff, Adams 1767: 74 ff, Campbell\n1762/1839: 96 ff, Douglas 1757: 96 ff).\n\n\nAside from these specific criticisms, one important general line of\nargument emerges in the criticisms, articulated well by Adams (1767:\n73):\n\n\nThere is a wide difference betwixt establishing false miracles, by\nthe help of a false religion, and establishing a false religion by the\nhelp of false miracles. Nothing is more easy than the former of these,\nor more difficult than the latter.\n\n\nAll attempts to draw an evidential parallel between the miracles of\nthe New Testament and the miracle stories of later ecclesiastical\nhistory are therefore dubious. There are simply more resources for\nexplaining how the ecclesiastical stories, which were promoted to an\nestablished and favorably disposed audience, could have arisen and been\nbelieved without there being any truth to the reports.\n3.3 The impact of Hume\u2019s \u201cOf Miracles\u201d\n\n\nHume\u2019s critique of the credibility of reported miracles\nprovoked a tidal wave of responses, of which the most important are\nAdams (1767), Leland (1755), Douglas (1757), Price (1777), and Campbell\n(1762/1839). There is not yet anything approaching a comprehensive\nsurvey of these responses. For limited but still useful historical\ndiscussions of Hume and his influence, see Leland (1755: 47\u2013135),\nLechler (1841: 425 ff), Farrar (1862: 148 ff), Stephen (1876: 309 ff),\nBurns (1981: 131 ff), Craig (1985), Houston (1994: 49\u201382), Tweyman\n(1996), Earman (2000), and Beauchamp\u2019s introduction to the\ncritical edition of Hume\u2019s Enquiry (Hume 1748/2000).\n\n\nAs Charles Sanders Peirce notes (Peirce 1958: 293), the Humean\nin-principle argument has left an indelible impression on modern\nbiblical scholarship. Humean considerations are expressly invoked in\nthe work of the great German critic David Friedrich Strauss (1879:\n199\u2013200), transformed into one of the \u201cpresuppositions of\ncritical history\u201d in the work of the philosopher F. H. Bradley\n(1874/1935), rechristened as the \u201cprinciple of analogy\u201d in\nthe writings of the theologian Ernst Troeltsch (1913), and endorsed,\nexplicitly or implicitly, in many contemporary studies of the\nhistorical Jesus (Dawes 2001: 97\u2013106) and the New Testament (Ehrman\n2003: 228\u201330). Commitment to something like Hume\u2019s position lies\non one side of a deep conceptual fault line that runs through the\ndiscipline of biblical studies.\n\n\nThe Humean objection has also been vigorously contested as destructive\nnot only of miracle stories but of common sense as well. The 19th\ncentury saw a proliferation of satires in which Humean scruples about\naccepting testimony for extraordinary tales were applied to the events\nof secular history, with consequences that are equally disastrous and\nhumorous (Whately 1819/1874, Hudson 1857, Buel 1894). Whately\u2019s\nsatire, which is the most famous, \u201cestablishes\u201d on the\nbasis of many historical improbabilities that Napoleon never existed\nbut was a mythic figure invented by the British government to enhance\nnational unity. Each of these satires makes the same point. One may\nlegitimately require more evidence for a miracle story than for a\nmundane story (Sherlock 1729/1843: 55); but in exaggerating this\nsensible requirement into an insuperable epistemic barrier, Hume and\nhis followers are applying a standard that cannot be applied without\nabsurdity in any other field of historical investigation.\n\n\nA curious feature of recent discussions is that Hume\u2019s\ncritique of reported miracles has itself come under heavy fire and is now viewed in some\nquarters as requiring defense. For a range of views on the matter, see\nLevine (1989: 152 ff), who maintains that Part 1 contains an argument\nbut that the argument is a failure, Johnson (1999), who argues that\nPart 1 is confused and unclear and that various attempts to clarify it\nhave failed to elicit a compelling line of argument, Earman (2000), who\nargues that Part 1 is an \u201cabject failure,\u201d Fogelin\n(2003), who aims to rehabilitate Hume against the critiques of Johnson\nand Earman in particular, and Millican (2013), who argues vigorously that the interpretation of Hume\u2019s argument offered in Earman (2000) is flawed in multiple ways. Millican (2011) offers a sympathetic reconstruction of Hume\u2019s critique in the wider context of Hume\u2019s other metaphysical and epistemological work.\n\n4. Arguments from Miracles\n\n\nGranting for the sake of argument that a reported miracle, in the\nsense of an event beyond the productive capacity of nature, has been\nestablished, what follows? Historically, many participants in the\ndiscussion have been ready to grant that, at least when the religious\nsignificance of the event is obvious and the doctrine or claim it\nostensibly attests is not otherwise objectionable, the miracle must\nhave been worked by God and that it provides significant confirmation\nfor the doctrine or claim. Indeed, the enduring popularity of the\nargument from miracles underscores the truth of Butler\u2019s\nobservation that miracles are one of the \u201cdirect and fundamental\nproofs\u201d of Christianity (Butler 1736/1819: 173).\n4.1 Would miracles be evidence for the existence of God?\n\n\nThere are two exceptions to this general acquiescence in the\nevidential value of miracles. First, there is a question regarding the\nidentity of the cause. If God alone can work miracles, this is easily\nsettled; but this claim has been a point of contention in the\ntheological literature, with some writers (Clarke 1719: 305 ff; Trench\n1847) maintaining that lesser, created spirits may work miracles, while\nothers (e.g. Farmer 1771, Wardlaw 1852, Cooper 1876) vigorously deny\nthis. The point is of some interest to the evaluation of arguments for\nmiracles, since as Baden Powell points out, there is a\ndistinction\n\n\nbetween an extraordinary fact,\u2014which is a proper\nmatter for human testimony\u2014and the belief in its being\ncaused by Divine interposition, which is a matter of\nopinion, and consequently not susceptible of support by\ntestimony, but dependent on quite other considerations.\n(Powell 1859: 287\u201388, following up on a distinction made in Less 1773:\n260\u201362)\n\n\nPowell is quite right to say that testimony is not the proper source\nfor evidence of the supernatural nature of the event. But it does not\nfollow that all opinions on the point are equally reasonable. The very\ndescription of the event\u2014and even more, of the context in which\nit occurs\u2014might render any naturalistic alternatives\nnon-starters. Whether this is the case will depend, not on general\nconsiderations, but on the details of the case in question.\n\n\nSecond, it is occasionally argued that, contrary to what most\nphilosophers and theologians have assumed, actual confirmed cases of\nmiracles could not count in favor of the existence of God. George\nChryssides (1975) argues that a miracle, conceived as a violation of a\nscientific law, could never be attributed to any agent, divine or\notherwise, since the assignment of agency implies predictability. This\nbold contention has not attracted many defenders. Gregory Dawes (2009)\npursues a related but more moderate line of argument, urging that it is\ndifficult to meet the standard necessary to attribute particular events\nto the personal agency of God. But Dawes does not present this as an\nabsolute barrier to theistic explanations.\n\n\nOverall (1985) argues for the more radical contention that a miracle\nwould count as evidence against the existence of God, on three\ngrounds: (1) if order and harmony are evidence for the existence of\nGod, then a miracle, which entails a breach in the order and harmony of\nthe universe, must count against the existence of God; (2) the\ninevitable controversies over the identification and authentication of\na miracle are an impediment to the growth of scientific knowledge and\nphilosophical comprehension; and (3) an omnipotent God who does\nintervene in His creation would be obliged, on pain of moral defect, to\nintervene more often and more evenhandedly than He is supposed to have\ndone in the Christian tradition.\n\n\nThese considerations have not, however, moved many philosophers to\nendorse Overall\u2019s position. Argument (1), besides giving a\ntendentious characterization of a miracle, exemplifies a fallacy in\nprobabilistic reasoning, assuming that if \\(F\\) entails \\({\\sim}E\\)\nand \\(E\\) is evidence for \\(H\\), then \\(F\\) is evidence against \\(H\\),\nwhich is not in general true. Claim (2) is arguably simply false, as\nsuch controversies do not appear noticeably to have impeded the\nprogress of science or philosophy. Argument (3) will be effective\nagainst a certain sort of theological position, but it is not one that\nmany believers in miracles actually hold. For further discussion of\nthis issue, see the exchanges between Larmer and Overall (Larmer 1988:\n75\u201382, Overall 1997, Overall 2003, and Larmer 2004).\n4.2 How much would credible miracle reports establish?\n\n\nIn the final analysis, the relevance of background beliefs looms\nlarge. To say this is not to endorse a lazy and unprincipled\nrelativism; rather, the point is that one\u2019s considered rational\njudgment regarding the existence and nature of God must take into\naccount far more than the evidence for miracle claims. That is not to\nsay that they could not be an important or even, under certain\ncircumstances, a decisive piece of evidence; it is simply that neither\na positive nor a negative claim regarding the existence of God can be\nestablished on the basis of evidence for a miracle claim alone, without\nany consideration of other aspects of the question.\n\n\nFor the evidence for a miracle claim, being public and empirical, is\nnever strictly demonstrative, either as to the fact of the event or as\nto the supernatural cause of the event. It remains possible, though the\nfacts in the case may in principle render it wildly improbable, that\nthe testifier is either a deceiver or himself deceived; and so long as\nthose possibilities exist, there will be logical space for other forms\nof evidence to bear on the conclusion. Arguments about miracles\ntherefore take their place as one piece\u2014a fascinating\npiece\u2014in a larger and more important puzzle.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ahmed, Arif, 2015, \u201cHume and the Independent Witnesses,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 124: 1013\u20131044.", "Aquinas, St. Thomas, <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> (<em>SCG</em>),\n [<a href=\"http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles.htm\" target=\"other\">Available online</a>,\n translation by J.
