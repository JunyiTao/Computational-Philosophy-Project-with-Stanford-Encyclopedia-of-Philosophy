    "main_text": "Doctrine of God\n3. Doctrine of God\n\nThe opening chapter of Origen\u2019s First Principles is a\nparadigmatic instance of his application of philosophic reasoning to\nbiblical exegesis. He assumes here what he asserts elsewhere, that the\nnature of God is known to us only by his own revelation in the sacred\ntext. The scriptures tell us both that God is fire and that God is\nspirit, but Origen warns us not to deduce, from a literal construction\nof these terms, that he is a body (Princ. 1.1.1). It is\npossible but not certain, that he has in mind the Stoicizing theology\nof Tertullian: the Bible speaks more plainly on this matter than any\nStoic, and few of Origen\u2019s contemporaries would have doubted the\ncorporeality of fire or spirit. In urging the contrary position, that\nGod is incorporeal. Origen speaks not only for the Platonists but for\nall the Greek apologists of the church: the prevalent thought of his\ntime (and perhaps of ours) required that if God is to be invisible,\nimmutable, eternal, omnipresent, and irresistible in power he must not\nbe confined to one place or composed of labile matter. The\nphilosophical sympathies of Origen become evident when he goes on to\nequate this bodiless god with nous or intellect. In Plato,\nnous had been an occasional synonym for the Demiurge, while\nNumenius of Apamea, half a century before Origen, had subordinated the\nDemiurge, as a second nous, to the \u201cfirst\nnous\u201d, which is Plato\u2019s form of the Good.\nAlthough the Good in Plato is superior to ousia or being,\nNumenius like the majority of Platonists before Origen, appears to\nhave posited nothing higher than intellect; Origen too\u2014in this\nrespect a good Platonist\u2014is less inclined to apophatic theology\nthan Philo the Alexandrian Jew or his Christian predecessors in Egypt,\nClement and Basilides. To explain the selective use of the definite\narticle in John 1.1, he characterizes the Father (ho theos)\nas autotheos, very God, in contrast to the Son who is merely\ntheos (CommJohn 2.7.16\u201318); when he suggests,\nhowever, that the Father is higher than nous (Against\nCelsus 7.45), he does not develop a metaphysical theory, any more\nthan he develops his hint in the same work that God may be the\nAristotelian \u201cthought of thoughts\u201d (see further Whittaker\n1969). Tobias B\u00f6hm\u2019s ingenious suggestion (2002) that for\nOrigen the being of God is his nous, and his unity that which\nis higher than nous, assumes that he was acquainted with the\nfirst and second hypotheses of the Parmenides, a dialogue of\nwhich he evinces little knowledge in his extant works. \n\nWhether he is noetic or supranoetic, Origen\u2019s God cannot be\nknown to us in his essence, nor is it by his ousia, or\nessence, but by his dunamis, or power, that he acts upon\nother beings (On Prayer 25.3). His dunamis, which is\ninfinite and mediated by the second person of the Trinity, is the\nsource of every dunamis that is exercised by his creatures,\neven by those who have fallen into apostasy and rebellion\n(CommJohn 1.39.291). On the other hand nothing, not even the\nsecond person, proceeds directly from the immutable ousia of\nGod (CommJohn 13.25.153 and 20.18.157: see below). Yet, while\nhe asserts that God is by nature impassible\u2014in the sense that he\nis the agent, not the patient, in every transaction and cannot be\nmoved by any external force\u2014Origen is one of the first\ntheologians to assert that he can suffer, in a sense, as God, and not\nonly by virtue of the incarnation (Homilies on Ezekiel 6.1;\nsee Osborn 1994: 164\u2013184). This suffering takes the form of\ncommiseration for the plight of his sinful creatures, never of sorrow\non his own account. Compassion supposes knowledge, and Origen appears\nto have been untroubled by the difficulties that arise from the\nascription of contingent knowledge to an eternal being. That God\ntranscends the temporal order is evident from his answer to those who\nask what God was doing before he created the world: the question, he\nargues, presupposes a time before the beginning of the world, but\nreflection teaches us that time and the revolutions of the cosmos are\ncoeval (Princ. 3.5.3). This is a Platonic doctrine, but it\nhad now become common for Platonists to argue, in submission to\nAristotle, that the temporal world has neither end nor beginning and\nis \u201cgenerated\u201d only in the sense that it is a theatre of\nvicissitude, in which all that exists has come into being and will\npass away. \n\nThe agent whom we call the Second Person of the Trinity is\n\u201canother god\u201d at Dialogue with Heraclides 2 and a\n\u201csecond god\u201d on two occasions in his work Against\nCelsus (5.39, 5.61). This appellation is not attested in earlier\nChristian prose, though it is anticipated in Philo and Numenius. It\ndoes not occur in works addressed by Origen to Christians of sound\nfaith, not even in those which show no fear of subordinating the Son\nto the Father\u2014an indication perhaps that it was avoided because\nit savoured of polytheism and not because it belied the equality of\nthe divine persons (Edwards 2006). It seems that in Numenius it is the\ncontemplation of the first intellect by the second that gives rise to\nthe forms, or Platonic ideas; Origen, as a Christian, holds that the\ncontemplation is mutual, since \u201cno-one knows the Son but the\nFather and no-one knows the Father but the Son\u201d (Matthew 11.27).\nThus he maintains, on the one hand, that the Son, as truth (John\n14.6), knows all that is in the mind of the Father; the infamous\nproviso that the Son does not see the Father signifies only that\nwithin the Godhead vision is not mediated by our physical organs\n(Princ. 1.1.8). On the other hand, when we read that the Son\nis the wisdom and power of the Father (1 Corinthians 1.24) and that\nthe world was created through him (Hebrews 1.2), we are to understand\nthat he is that divine helpmate who declares at Proverbs 8.22 that the\nLord created her in the beginning of his ways, and at Wisdom 7.26 that\nshe is the mirror of his unspotted majesty. The verb\n\u201ccreated\u201d in this text (which Origen prefers to the\nalternative reading \u201cpossessed\u201d) does not imply that the\nSon has a temporal beginning, but that, having no other substrate than\nthe Father\u2019s will, he expresses that will more perfectly than\nthe things that are \u201cmade\u201d from matter. It is\ninconceivable that the Father could ever have lacked wisdom, and\nequally inconceivable to Origen that this wisdom could ever have taken\na different form from the one that it now possesses as the second\nperson or hypostasis of the Trinity (Princ. 1.2.2). He is the\nfirst theologian to state unequivocally that the \u201cthree\nhypostases\u201d which constitute the Trinity are eternal not only in\nnature, but in their hypostatic character; there was never a time when\nwisdom was the latent thought of the Father and had not yet come forth\nas speech.\n\nThough Origen rejects it, this was in fact the prevailing thesis of\nmost Christian writing in the second century when it undertook to\nexplain the Fourth Evangelist\u2019s assertion that the one who\nbecame incarnate was the Logos who had been with the Father as\ntheos (god) if not ho theos (God) from the beginning\n(John 1.1). Since it was this speech or word that created the world,\nit was argued, there would have been no reason for it to exist before\nthe creation as a distinct hypostasis. If he existed at all, it was as\nthe logos endiathetos, the word within, which had not yet\nemerged from the mind as logos prophorikos, or verbal\nutterance. In this latent phase he could be identified (as Philo had\nalready argued) with the paradigm, or world of forms, which supplies\nthe Platonic demiurge with his pattern for the creation. Clement of\nAlexandria accepts this equation, albeit perhaps without denying the\nhypostatic eternity of the Logos (Edwards 2000). Origen, however,\nresists the interpretation of Logos as \u201cspeech\u201d because\nthere are some who take this to imply that the second person is merely\na function or epiphenomenon of the first (CommJohn 1.24.151;\nOrbe 1991). Logos, in his view, is one of the numerous designations\n(epinoiai) which are conferred on the second person to define\nhis relation, not to the Father (as \u201cSon\u201d and\n\u201cWisdom\u201d do) but to his creatures (CommJohn\n2.9.66 etc.): he is Logos as the paradigm and parent of all the\nlogikai, or rational beings, who exercise reason only by\nparticipation in him. He cannot be identified with the world of forms,\nor Platonic ideas, because to Origen these ideas are imaginary\nentities which the Greeks absurdly suppose to be independent of the\nCreator (Princ. 2.3.6). It appears then that he endorsed the\nolder and more literal reading of the Timaeus, according to\nwhich the Demiurge, the forms and matter are three autonomous\nprinciples of being. Before him Philo, Alcinous, and Clement of\nAlexandria had construed the forms as thoughts in the mind of the\nDemiurge, while Alexander of Aphrodisias held that they gave content\nto God\u2019s eternal contemplation of himself (Armstrong 1960).\nOrigen himself opines that all genera, all species and even the\narchetypes of all particular things are eternally present in the mind\nof God (Princ. 1.4.5), but he holds this as a Christian\nantidote to difficulties which arise from the temporality of the\nworld.\n",
