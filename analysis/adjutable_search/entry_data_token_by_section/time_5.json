Presentism, Eternalism, and the Growing Block Theory\n\nA further question that you might ask about time is an ontological\nquestion. Does whether something is past, present, or future make a\ndifference to whether it exists? And how do these ontological theses\nconnect to debates about the A-theory and the B-theory?\n\nAccording to presentism, only present objects exist. More precisely,\npresentism is the view that, necessarily, it is always true that only\npresent objects exist. Even more precisely, no objects exist in time\nwithout being present (abstract objects might exist outside of time).\n(Note that some writers have used the name differently, and unless\notherwise indicated, what is meant here by \u201cpresent\u201d is\ntemporally present, as opposed to spatially present.) According to\npresentism, if we were to make an accurate list of all the things that\nexist\u2014i.e., a list of all the things that our most unrestricted\nquantifiers range over\u2014there would be not a single merely past\nor merely future object on the list. Thus, you and the Taj Mahal would\nbe on the list, but neither Socrates nor any future Martian outposts\nwould be included. (Assuming, that is, both (i) that each person is\nidentical to his or her body, and (ii) that Socrates\u2019s body\nceased to be present\u2014thereby going out of existence, according\nto presentism\u2014shortly after he died. Those who reject the first\nof these assumptions should simply replace the examples in this\narticle involving allegedly non-present people with appropriate\nexamples involving the non-present bodies of those people.) And it is\nnot just Socrates and future Martian outposts, either\u2014the same\ngoes for any other putative object that lacks the property of being\npresent. No such objects exist, according to presentism.\n\nThere are different ways to oppose presentism\u2014that is, to defend\nthe view that at least some non-present objects exist. One version of\nnon-presentism is eternalism, which says that objects from both the\npast and the future exist. According to eternalism, non-present\nobjects like Socrates and future Martian outposts exist now, even\nthough they are not currently present. We may not be able to see them\nat the moment, on this view, and they may not be in the same\nspace-time vicinity that we find ourselves in right now, but they\nshould nevertheless be on the list of all existing things.\n\nIt might be objected that there is something odd about attributing to\na non-presentist the claim that Socrates exists now, since there is a\nsense in which that claim is clearly false. In order to forestall this\nobjection, let us distinguish between two senses of \u201cx\nexists now\u201d. In one sense, which we can call the temporal\nlocation sense, this expression is synonymous with \u201cx is\npresent\u201d. The non-presentist will admit that, in the temporal\nlocation sense of \u201cx exists now\u201d, it is true that\nno non-present objects exist now. But in the other sense of\n\u201cx exists now\u201d, which we can call the ontological\nsense, to say that \u201cx exists now\u201d is just to say\nthat x is now in the domain of our most unrestricted\nquantifiers. Using the ontological sense of \u201cexists\u201d, we\ncan talk about something existing in a perfectly general sense,\nwithout presupposing anything about its temporal location. When we\nattribute to non-presentists the claim that non-present objects like\nSocrates exist right now, we commit non-presentists only to the claim\nthat these non-present objects exist now in the ontological sense (the\none involving the most unrestricted quantifiers).\n\nAccording to the eternalist, temporal location does not affect\nontology. But according to a somewhat less popular version of\nnon-presentism, temporal location does matter when it comes to\nontology, because only objects that are either past or present exist.\nOn this view, which is often called the growing block theory, the\ncorrect ontology is always increasing in size, as more and more things\nare added on to the leading \u201cpresent\u201d edge (temporally\nspeaking). (Note, however, that the growing block theory does not\ninvolve any commitment to four-dimensionalism as discussed in\n section 7.\n In this way, the name \u201cgrowing block\u201d is somewhat\nmisleading and the view is probably better described as the growing\nuniverse theory.) Both presentism and the growing block theory are\nversions of the A-theory.\n\nDespite the claim by some presentists that theirs is the commonsense\nview, it is pretty clear that there are some major problems facing\npresentism (and, to a lesser extent, the growing block theory; but in\nwhat follows we will focus on the problems facing presentism). One\nproblem has to do with what appears to be perfectly meaningful talk\nabout non-present objects, such as Socrates and the year 3000. If\nthere really are no non-present objects, then it is hard to see what\nwe are referring to when we use expressions such as\n\u201cSocrates\u201d and \u201cthe year 3000\u201d.\n\nAnother problem for the presentist has to do with relations involving\nnon-present objects. It is natural to say, for example, that Abraham\nLincoln was taller than Napoleon Bonaparte, and that World War II was\na cause of the end of The Depression. But how can we make sense of\nsuch talk, if there are no non-present objects to be the relata of\nthose relations?\n\nA third problem for the presentist has to do with the very plausible\nprinciple that for every truth, there is a truth-maker\u2014something\nwhose existence suffices for the truth of the proposition or\nstatement. If you are a presentist, it is hard to see what the\ntruth-makers could be for truths such as that there were dinosaurs and\nthat there will be Martian outposts.\n\nFinally, the presentist, in virtue of being an A-theorist, must deal\nwith the arguments against the A-theory that were mentioned above,\nincluding especially the worry that the A-theory is incompatible with\nspecial relativity. We will discuss these physics-based objections\nbelow.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Adams 1986; Bourne\n2006; Bigelow 1996; Emery 2020; Hinchliff 1996; Ingram 2016; Keller\nand Nelson 2001; Markosian 2004, 2013; McCall 1994; Rini and Cresswell\n2012; Sider 1999, 2001; Sullivan 2012b; Tooley 1997; Zimmerman 1996,\n1998.\n",
