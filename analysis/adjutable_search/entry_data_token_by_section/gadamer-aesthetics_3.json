    "main_text": "Play\n4. Play\n\nGadamer\u2019s discussion of the relation between art and play should\nnot be equated with any argument that art is a trivial game or\npastime. He follows the precedent of Schiller\u2019s Letters on\nAesthetic Education, which contend that artworks are dramatic in\nthat they put something into play. The underlying motif is\nthat aesthetic consciousness is far from self-contained but is rather\ndrawn into the play of something much larger than what is evident to\nsubjective consciousness. The analogy with drama and, indeed, sporting\nevents, implies that art is eventual, an occasion that consciousness\nsurrenders to and participates in. Spectatorial participation (like\nmuch art research) demands immersion in that which cannot be fully\nanticipated or controlled by individual consciousness. The game and\nthe artwork are both forms of self-movement which require that the\nspectator play along with what they bring into being (RB 23). Gadamer\nasserts the \u201cprimacy of the play\u201d over consciousness:\n\u201cthe players are merely the way the play comes into\npresentation\u201d (TM 92, 98). Participation takes the individual\nplayers out of themselves. The individual subject is that upon which\nsuccess, satisfaction,\u00a0or loss is imposed from within the game.\nBy analogy, the work of art is also \u201cthe playing of it.\u201d\nAn autonomous event comes into being, something comes to stand in its\nown right which \u201cchanges all that stand before it\u201d (RB\n25). Like the ancient theoros, the spectator not only\nparticipates in the event which is the artwork\u00a0but is potentially\ntransformed by it (RB 24).\n\nThe game analogy also serves to undermine approaches to art which are\nexclusively intentional, material, and conventional. First: the\nsubjectivity of an artist cannot be an appropriate interpretive\nstarting point. Grasping what transpires in a player\u2019s\nconsciousness does not reveal the nature of the game being played.\nReconstructing the conscious life of an artist, pace\nDilthey\u2019s hermeneutics of nacherleben (re-living), may\nreveal interesting aspects of an artist\u2019s intentions, but it\ndoes not uncover what informs that subjectivity. Second: as with the\ngame, art is not to be understood by reference to its tools and\nequipment alone. Art, no doubt,\u00a0requires materials and an\nappreciation of how a specific tool might be used. Yet neither game\nnor art is constituted by its equipment. Third: comprehending a game\nor an artwork requires an appreciation of the appropriate rules or\nconventions. What constitutes fair or foul play depends upon a set of\npre-understood principles just as what is esteemed excellent in art\nrequires normative expectancies of appraisal. Yet art\u2019s vitality\nclearly does not reside merely in the following of conventions.\n\nThe overall argument is not that a game or an artwork cannot be\nreduced to intention, material, or convention but rather that each of\nthese elements comes into their own when taken up within the\nplaying of the game or in the practice which is art.\nIt is the playing that draws spectator, player, intention, equipment,\nand convention into the one event. This promotes an interactive view\nof art as a communicative event. It lends a dialogical dimension to\nart. An artwork involves more than one voice as, indeed, the word\ninter-pretation implies. Furthermore, the conception of art\nas an event requires a different ontological structure to those\nstandard accounts of aesthetic experience grounded in subjectivity\nalone. An artwork is not an object completely independent of the\nspectator yet somehow given over to the spectator for his or her\npersonal enjoyment. To the contrary, the game analogy suggests that\nthe act of spectatorship contributes to enhancing the being of the\nartwork by bringing what is at play within it to fuller realization.\nThe spectator just as much as the artist plays a crucial role in\ndeveloping the subject-matters that art activates. The aesthetic\nspectator is swept up by her experience of art, absorbed in its play,\nand potentially transformed by that which spectatorship helps\nconstitute. Though Gadamer\u2019s argument distances itself from\ntraditional subject-object paradigms, it does retain certain features\nof Kant\u2019s aesthetics. In other words, Gadamer\u2019s engagement\nwith Kantian aesthetics is a complicated matter. In Truth and\nMethod, Gadamer\u2019s tone vis-a-vis Kant\u2019s claims in the\nCritique of Judgment is at times polemical; however, his\nreading of Kant is not simply dismissive and critical but also\ninvolves creatively reworking many of Kant\u2019s insights. For\nexample, whereas Kant attributes a non-purposive rationality to the\naesthetic attitude, Gadamer attributes it to the playful process of\nart practice itself. Both art and the game share a to-and-fro movement\nnot tied to any specific goal other than to fulfil themselves for\ntheir own sake (TM 103): no one knows how a game will end and no one\nknows to what end an artwork works (Lawn 2006, 91). However, what is\nclear is that it is what occurs when the artwork or the game is\nin-play that matters. Often contrary to their own willing and doing,\nthe spectator is taken over by a substantial and consequential event\nthat transcends the boundaries of everyday consciousness and which has\nno purpose other than to bring something forth.\n\nPerhaps the most important difference between Kant\u2019s aesthetics\nand Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutical aesthetics is the latter\u2019s\nclaim that art communicates truth. In the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant argues that aesthetic ideas elude conceptual\ndetermination and linguistic capture. Such claims resonate with\nGadamer\u2019s view of art, as he contends that an artwork\u2019s\nmeaning cannot be conceptually exhaused. In other words, the artwork\nalways has an excess of meaning. However, unlike Kant, Gadamer affirms\nthat in our expeience of art, we are confronted with truths that have\nthe potential to foster greater self- and world-understanding. In\nshort, Gadamer maintains precisely what Kant denies \u2013 namely,\nGadamer claims that art is not separated from truth and\nknowledge but rather our experience of art as event discloses truth.\nAs Daniel L. Tate observes, Gadamer parts ways with Kant by insisting\nthat \u201cthe experience of art attests to a truth that\ncannot be exhaustively presented in terms of definitive\nknowledge\u201d (Tate 2009, 292). Another key difference between\nGadamer\u2019s and Kant\u2019s accounts is Gadamer\u2019s\nthematization of the spectator\u2019s active role. Gadamer\nstresses the active role of the spectator in his 1980 essay\n\u201cIntuition and Vividness\u201d (in RB, GW8) which can be\nunderstood as a further development of his reflections on spectatorial\nengagement in Truth and Method. In \u201cIntuition and\nVividness,\u201d written twenty years after the publication of\nTruth and Method, Gadamer reworks Kantian insights regarding\nthe formative or productive role of the imagination into his own\naccount of the spectator\u2019s creative and active\nparticipation in the artwork\u2019s coming to presence. For instance,\nhe claims that when the spectator lingers with an artwork, her\nimagination synthesizes the intuitions in which the presentation of a\nmeaningful whole emerges as a formed image. While this formed image is\nbrought into relation with the understanding and incites thought,\nneither it nor the entire formative process is determined by given\nconcepts; rather, as Tate points out, the formed image that comes to\nstand is originally constructed by the imagination (Tate\n2009, 292). The formed image enables engaged spectators to make\nconnections and draw conclusions that exceed their present experience.\nAs a result, art has the ability to present us with future, unrealized\npossibilities. Gadamer\u2019s creative reworking of Kantian\nimagination and aesthetic ideas underscores both the creative and\nformative abilities of the imagination vis-a-vis our experience of art\nand, importantly, the power of art\u2019s truths \u2013\n\u201ctruths that disclose the finitude of our being and our need for\nothers. In the dynamic, participatory event that art is, we are\ninvited \u2013 even provoked \u2013 to imagine ourselves, others,\nand our present world otherwise, which\u00a0is to imagine (and perhaps\neven hope for) a different (and better) future\u201d (Nielsen 2023,\n38).\n",
