    "main_text": "The Reception and Critique of Philosophical Professionalism\n6. The Period of Military Rule\n\nThe military coup of September 11, 1973 led by General Augusto\nPinochet was followed by sixteen and a half years of dictatorship. The\nproclaimed intent of the coup was to reestablish order after the\nchaotic years of the Allende administration. Within a few years,\nhowever, it was obvious that the regime intended to transform Chilean\nsociety and politics, closing the Congress, banning political parties,\nespecially those of the Left, and introducing a new Constitution in\n1980. In the area of higher education, the military regime reversed\nyears of university autonomy and intervened directly in the\nadministration of the principal universities of the country: it\nappointed as Rectors military officers on active duty, closed several\nschools and faculties, and purged academics and students perceived to\nbe dissidents or potential opponents. The military as an institution\ndid not act alone, as it counted on a significant number of civilian\nsupporters.\n\nThe Department of Philosophy at the University of Chile was perhaps\nthe hardest hit among philosophy departments in the nation. As the\nflagship public university, with a history going back to 1842, the\nUniversity of Chile was from the start of the military regime the\ntarget of severe and continuous repression. Critics like Juan Rivano\nwere arrested and sent into exile while others, like Edison Otero\n(1946), were dismissed without charges. The military placed the\nUniversity of Chile first under the aegis of the Air Force and\nsubsequently (1976) the Army. But instead of relying on those\nprofessionals who had opposed university reform, like Jorge Millas,\nHumberto Giannini, or Gast\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Lasa, it placed\nlargely unknown though sympathetic philosophers in key academic and\nadministrative positions. As a result, professional philosophers\nbecame increasingly alienated from the regime and some turned into\nvocal opponents.\n\nPerhaps the most important example is that of Jorge Millas. Initially\nhe was hopeful that the military would indeed seek to realize his\nideal view of the university as a home of reflection and reason. By\n1976, however, his hopes had turned into disillusion: Millas attacked\nthe military intervention of the universities, declaring that there\nwas no improvement from the politicization of higher education in the\n1960s and early 1970s; the university had become an institution\n\u201cunder surveillance\u201d (1981: 84). His own philosophical\nwork paid increasing attention to the theme of violence, as he\ndemonstrated in La violencia y sus m\u00e1scaras (1978),\nco-authored with critical philosopher Edison Otero, a collaboration\nthat signaled a rapprochement between the two historical philosophical\ntraditions in the country. Isolated and increasingly alienated by\ngovernment censorship, Millas retreated to the southern Universidad\nAustral in Valdivia, where he was initially welcomed but soon removed\n(1980) for his increasingly public and vocal criticisms of the regime.\nIn one of his last works, Idea de la Universidad (1981), he\nrenewed his life-long commitment to the university as the site of\nscholarship and reflection, and reiterated his critique of military\nintervention. Silenced, isolated and ill, he died at the age of 65 in\n1982.\n\nOther philosophers were not as vocal as Millas, but were clearly\nunhappy with the military handling of both the universities and the\nnation. Established philosophers like Humberto Giannini and\nGast\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Lasa concentrated on their philosophical\nwork, and on occasion made pronouncements that could be seen as\ncritical. But the environment of repression was not conducive to the\ndialogue and free inquiry that they felt the field required. Exiled\nphilosophers like Juan Rivano were even less able to find national\noutlets for their opinions. He was banned from the country and unable\nto return until after the plebiscite of 1988. That was the turning\npoint that unleashed the transition to democracy that culminated with\nthe presidential elections of 1989, and the inauguration of the\nPatricio Aylwin administration in 1990.\n\nThe balance of the period is negative for the philosophers involved\nexcept for those who occupied the positions of those persecuted under\nmilitary rule and who remained in their posts even after the\nrestoration of democracy. Still, an important change took place as a\nresult of the years of dictatorship: those philosophers who were\nhostile to politics now fully embraced the value of democracy with all\nits implications for accommodating different points of view. As a\nresult of the hostile climate present at the universities, many\nmigrated to independent research centers and thus entered into\ndialogue with scholars from other disciplines. Philosophers were thus\nable to break away from the separation of philosophy and politics that\ncharacterized the foundations of the field in the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nAnother important element to emerge from the period of military rule,\nand perhaps even before, is the number of philosophers who moved\nabroad in response to political turmoil, like Roberto Torretti (1930)\nand Carla Cordua (1925), or because of outright persecution as in the\ncase of Juan Rivano and Renato Cristi (1941). There is a significant\nphilosophical production that must be included in a longer-term\nexamination of the history of the field in Chile. There are others of\na younger generation who were trained abroad and whose work upon\nreturning to the country started to have an impact in the field.\n\nSince the return to civilian rule in 1990, the field of philosophy has\nconfronted numerous challenges, such as new national priorities (human\nrights, economic growth, constitutional reforms, erosion of\ninstitutional legitimacy), the fragmentation of the field due to the\nproliferation of new private universities, and an unsuccessful attempt\nby the National Council of Education to remove philosophy from the\nsecondary school curriculum (2018). At the same time, philosophy has\nflourished in other respects, thanks to the continued production of\nthe previous generation (Roberto Torretti, Carla Cordua, Renato Cristi\nand Marcos Garc\u00eda de la Huerta) or the posthumous publications\nof Jorge Millas, Juan Rivano and Humberto Giannini. Until his death in\n2017 Jorge Eduardo Rivera (born 1927) remained as the most important\nspecialist on Heidegger. Pablo Oyarz\u00fan (1950) has made\nsignificant contributions to aesthetics and literary criticism,\nRecently, Andr\u00e9s Claro (1968) has emerged as a powerful new\nphilosophical voice, concerned with the poetical dimensions of\nlanguage, in such works as Las vasijas quebradas (2012), and Tiempos\nsin fin (2018). A new trend has emerged on the examination of the\nphilosophical bases of modern economics, best exemplified in Leonidas\nMontes\u2019 (1966) Adam Smith en contexto (2017).\n",
