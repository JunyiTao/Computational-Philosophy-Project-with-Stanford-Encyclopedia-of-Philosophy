    "main_text": "What is a social minimum?\n1. What is a social minimum?\n\nOur first task, then, is to clarify what a social minimum is. When we\nspeak of a \u201csocial minimum\u201d we mean to refer to the\nbundle of resources that a person needs in order to lead a minimally\ndecent life in their society. Now the members of a society might\ndecide to introduce a set of institutions and policies that\nsecures every member reasonable access to a social minimum in\nthis sense. We shall refer to this set of institutions and policies as\na \u201csocial minimum policy regime\u201d. In the discussion that\nfollows we shall often speak of \u201cenacting a social\nminimum\u201d. Enactment is a somewhat legalistic word, but we intend\nthe term to be understood broadly here; \u201cenacting a social\nminimum\u201d means putting in place a social minimum policy regime.\n(Strictly speaking, we should perhaps speak of \u201cenacting a\nsocial minimum policy regime\u201d; but \u201cenacting a social\nminimum\u201d is a less clumsy phrase, and these comments should\nsuffice to make clear what we mean by it.) These concepts\u2014of the\nsocial minimum and of a social minimum policy regime\u2014are\nintended to be quite abstract, and they clearly raise further\nquestions. These include:\n\n(1)\nHow do we specify the level and kind of resources that people need\n\u201cto lead a minimally decent life in their\nsociety\u201d?\n(2)\nWhat do we mean by speaking of \u201creasonable access\u201d to\na social minimum?\n\n\nWe shall now explore question\n (1)\n in sections 1.1\u20131.3, turning to question\n (2)\n in section\n 1.4.\n\nA further preliminary point will be helpful to note first, however.\nWhen we speak of a \u2018society\u2019 enacting a social minimum, this term can\nbe taken in different ways. We could be referring to a national\nsociety and thus to the enactment of a social minimum by a national\ngovernment. Or we could be talking about a society at a transnational\nor the global level, and to the enactment of a transnational or global\nsocial minimum. In the discussion that follows, we will assume a\nnational context as the baseline for discussion but many of the\narguments are also relevant to a transnational or global context.\n",
