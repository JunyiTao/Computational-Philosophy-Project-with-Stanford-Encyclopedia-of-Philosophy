    "main_text": "Art as Experience || The Naturalistic Roots of Aesthetic Theory\n2.1 The Naturalistic Roots of Aesthetic Theory\n\nThe aesthetic theory that Dewey develops in Art as Experience\ncould be labeled moderately naturalist. While Dewey locates the\n\u201cactive seeds\u201d of art and other aesthetic phenomena in\nnatural processes (AE: 18), he in no way seeks to reduce them\nto natural reality nor does he try to explain their origins and\nperseverance by locating a place for them in the development of the\nhuman species, as some contemporary forms of evolutionary aesthetics\ndo. Rather, Dewey\u2019s naturalism is of an emergent sort, in the\nsense that he seeks to show how aesthetic experience and culture\nemerge from the natural basis of life, as he understands it (Alexander\n2013). The key element of this moderate naturalism is the idea of an\norganism, or of \u201cthe live creature\u201d\u2014a term that\nDewey also often uses\u2014which is in a constant interaction with\nits surrounding world. Dewey argues that this interaction is marked by\nshifting and reinforcing phases of disarray and stability, of\nunsettlement and restoration of harmony, which, in Dewey\u2019s view,\ngive experience its basic structure. As Dewey explains in an\noft-quoted passage, \n\n\nlife goes on in an environment; not merely in it but because\nof it, through interaction with it. (AE: 19, italics in the\noriginal) \n\n\nNot surprisingly, Dewey\u2019s conception of experience, upon which\nhis aesthetics is built, has been described as\n\u201cecological\u201d (Hildebrand 2008).\n\nIn line with his naturalism, Dewey is highly critical of attempts to\nidealize art and the aesthetic away from \u201cthe objects of\nconcrete experience\u201d (AE: 17), as well as of the\naspiration to explain art\u2019s value by its supposed capacity to\ndisclose some higher forms of reality from the natural one we share\nwith other animals. For Dewey, this kind of spiritual take on art is\nyet another example of the human ambition to build permanence within\nthe constantly changing and unpredictable natural world. He traces the\norigins of many influential dualisms, for example between \u201chigh\nand low\u201d and \u201cmaterial and ideal\u201d, as well as\n\u201cthe contempt for the body\u201d and \u201cthe fear of the\nsenses\u201d, to this more fundamental dualism between spirit and\nnature (AE: 26). Already in Experience and Nature,\nDewey argues that there are but two alternatives, \n\n\neither art is a continuation\u2026 of natural tendencies of natural\nevents; or art is a peculiar addition to nature springing from\nsomething dwelling exclusively in the breast of man, whatever name be\ngiven to the latter. (EN: 291) \n\n\nHe favors the first alternative and takes the movement between\ninstability and stability, activity and passivity, doing and\nundergoing that he thinks are intrinsic qualities of all experience as\nthe starting points of his aesthetic theorizing. Dewey: \n\n\nThese biological commonplaces are something more than that; they reach\nto the roots of the esthetic in experience. (AE: 20)\n\n\nWhile Dewey promotes a naturalistic starting point for aesthetic\ntheory, he is equally aware of the negative connotations which have\noften been attached to naturalist understandings of art and the\naesthetic, and the scale of the transformation that the rapid\ndevelopment of the natural sciences had on people\u2019s sense of\nthemselves. For physical science seemed to strip \n\n\nits objects of the qualities that give the objects and scenes of\nordinary experience all their poignancy and preciousness.\n(AE: 341) \n\n\nHowever, Dewey finds these worries unfounded. A naturalist aesthetics,\nwhich fully recognizes \u201cthe continuity of the organs, needs and\nbasic impulses of the human creature with his animal forebears\u201d,\ndoes not imply a \u201cnecessary reduction of man to the level of\nbrutes\u201d. Rather only a naturalist approach can properly account\nfor the nearly miraculous fact that something as complex and\n\u201cmarvelous\u201d as art and aesthetic experience can emerge\nfrom the most basic units of life (AE: 28).\n\nThe goal of aesthetic theory, in Dewey\u2019s view, should not,\ntherefore, be to spiritualize works of art and to set them apart from\nthe objects of ordinary experience, but to disclose the \u201cway in\nwhich these works idealize qualities found in common\nexperience\u201d. (AE: 17) It is in other words wrong to\nthink of the aesthetic as a luxurious or transcendentally ideal\n\u201cintruder in experience from without\u201d. Rather, the\naesthetic in experience should be understood as \u201cthe clarified\nand intensified development of traits that belong to every normally\ncomplete experience\u201d. Precisely this kind of naturalist approach\nrepresents for Dewey \u201cthe only secure basis upon which esthetic\ntheory can be built\u201d (AE: 52\u201353).\n",
