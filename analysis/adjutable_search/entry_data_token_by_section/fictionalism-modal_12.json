    "main_text": "Other Concerns || The Theoretical Primitives of Modal Fictionalism\n4.4 The Theoretical Primitives of Modal Fictionalism\n\nMetaphysical theories often rely on resources which are taken as\n\u201cprimitive\u201d: roughly, theoretical resources which are not\nto be further explained or analysed. Different theories of the same\nsubject matter will often take different resources to be primitive,\nand while it is a difficult question to decide whether one set of\nprimitives is better or worse than another, evaluation of the relative\nsimplicity, naturalness, or other merits of theoretical primitives is\npart of the evaluation of rival theories. This sort of comparison can\ncan be especially relevant in areas where disputes between rival\ntheories are not to be settled easily by experiment or observation.\nSuch disputes make up one of the battlegrounds between fictionalists\nand their rivals, with anti-fictionalists claiming that the unanalysed\ntheoretical resources which fictionalists rely on render fictionalist\ntheories unattractive, or at least relatively unattractive compared to\nsome rival or other.\n\nThe central piece of theoretical machinery the modal fictionalist\nemploys is the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator. When\nit is glossed in tempting ways, as \u201cif PW were true, then\n\u2026\u201d or \u201cit follows from PW that \u2026\u201d, it\nseems to be a modal notion: and if this is not to be further\nexplained, the modal fictionalist cannot use the fiction of possible\nworlds and its contents as the basis of an analysis of modality in\nterms of something else. (This sort of analysis is sometimes known as\na reductive analysis.) This will only be of concern to some\nmodal fictionalists, of course \u2014 timid fictionalists will not\nhave been looking for a reductive analysis of modality based on their\nfiction in the first place \u2014 and some timid fictionalists such\nas Divers 1999b explicitly endorse modal explanations of the\nfictionalist operator (Divers 1999b, p. 335). Such fictionalists may\nbe happy to take advantage of possible analyses of \u201caccording to\nthe fiction\u201d operators in modal terms, and in so doing provide\nan answer to the question of how to understand such expressions: but\non the other hand, their position may not be attractive to someone\nprimarily concerned to analyse modal operators. (Even timid\nfictionalism is compatible with a reductionist account of modality, of\ncourse, since the timid fictionalist may seek to explain modality in\nsome other terms. It is just that it is not hospitable to reductionist\naccounts of modality in terms of possible worlds).\n\nA fictionalist who wishes to provide an analysis of modality, on the\nother hand, had better not take their \u201caccording to PW\n\u2026\u201d operator to be analysed in terms of standard modal\ndevices, or alternatively in terms of possible worlds (see Rosen 1990,\npp. 344\u2013345). The canonical version of the theory that Rosen\npresents takes the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator to\nbe a primitive one: that is, one which is not to be further analysed,\nin modal or non-modal terms (Rosen 1995, p. 70). Rosen points out that\none might think that his favoured prefix is a modal locution, and if\nso even his position cannot be said to entirely reduce the modal in\nfavour of the non-modal (Rosen 1990, pp. 344-345). Nevertheless, as he\npoints out, it may still be thought to be some theoretical advance to\nbe able to explain all of the other modal notions using only this one.\nIt is hard to know how the issue of whether or not \u201caccording to\nPW\u2026\u201d should count as a modal operator is to be decided:\nin any case, it will not be further pursued here.\n\nRegardless of its status as a modal locution, Rosen recognizes that it\nis a very unsatisfying primitive: the notion of a proposition being\ntrue according to PW is an unlikely one to be considered basic and\nunanalysable. Whether or not this is a fatal flaw of Rosen\u2019s\nproposal is, he acknowledges, \u201ca matter of somewhat delicate\njudgement\u201d (Rosen 1990, p. 349). What he does have to say about\nit, however, is that arguably many realists about possible worlds have\nalso not provided a satisfactory analysis of the \u201caccording to\nthe fiction \u2026\u201d operator, and so face the same\n challenge.[7]\n\n\nThe issue of whether \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d is a\nsatisfactory theoretical primitive is presumably partly to be settled\nby seeing what rival theories are possible, and what primitives they\nneed to rely on to account for modality and for fiction. Beyond that,\nhow to settle disputes about the relative attractiveness of primitives\nis a difficult issue in philosophical methodology. Taking such an\napparently complex operator to be unanalysable looks unattractive\n(Nolan 1997a, pp. 273\u2013274), but the position is perhaps not\nuntenable. A better option for the modal fictionalist interested in\nanalysing modality in terms of the modal fiction might be to attempt a\nnon-modal explanation of what is true according to fiction. In any\ncase, this problem, like many problems for modal fictionalism, does\nnot arise for the timid modal fictionalist. For those fictionalists\nfor which it is a problem, however, the unattractiveness and\nunintuitiveness of taking \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d or a\nsimilar device to be primitive remain a largely unaddressed\nchallenge.\n",
