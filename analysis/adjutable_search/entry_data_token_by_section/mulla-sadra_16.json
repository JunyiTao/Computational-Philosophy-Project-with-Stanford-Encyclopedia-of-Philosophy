    "main_text": "Eschatology || Eschatology as Completion of Metaphysics\n6. Legacy and the school of Mulla Sadra\n\nMulla Sadra has become the dominant philosopher of the Islamic East\nand his approach to the nature of philosophy has been exceptionally\ninfluential. His real achievement apart from his doctrinal\npropositions was to effect a culmination of a tendency within the\nphilosophical schools of the post-Avicennan period, namely to\nsynthesize and reconcile reason and intuition, faith and rational\ninquiry, philosophy and mysticism within a largely late Neoplatonic\nparadigm of doing philosophy. Philosophy is thus a practice and a way\nof life in which reflection, reading, and learning are always\ncomplemented by spiritual practices and exercises. One cannot become a\nsage purely on the basis on one\u2019s own intellectual efforts, nor\ncan one truly understand the nature of reality as an illiterate\nascetic reliant solely on mystical intuition. In this way, Mulla\nSadra, in a manner representative of a number of Muslim thinkers\ninsistent upon the median way of their faith, represents a mean\nbetween \u2018excessive\u2019 ratiocination and the unfettered\nclaims of pure experience made by mystics.\n\nHis influence on philosophical practice and learning is evident. His\ncommentary on the peripatetic work al-Hidaya (The Guidance)\nof Athir al-Din Abhari (d. 662 AH/1264) became the cornerstone of the\nrationalist curriculum of the Indian madrasa from the 18th century. In\nIran, the study of Islamic philosophy takes its cue from the study and\ncommentary on his major works at least from the nineteenth century.\nThe revival of Islamic philosophy in Isfahan ushered in by \u2018Ali\nNuri (d. 1251 AH/1836) and later Hadi Sabzavari (d. 1289 AH/1873),\ndescribed as the \u2018last great Islamic philosopher,\u2019\nestablished Mulla Sadra as the ultimate philosopher, whose thought and\narguments \u2018transcended\u2019 discursive Peripatetic philosophy\nand also intuitive and allusive mystical arguments and discourse, in\nfavour of a higher synthesis that combined ratiocinative arguments\nwith mystical insight, complete syllogistic demonstrations with\nnarrative, allusion, and allegory. In more recent times, some of the\nkey thinkers involved in the Islamic Revolution of 1979, such as\nAyatollah Khomeini and Mortaza Motahhari, were profoundly influenced\nby the thought of Mulla Sadra, and some have even attempted to\nappropriate Mulla Sadra as the \u2018philosopher of the\nRevolution\u2019 despite the distinct lack of an engagement with\npolitical philosophy in his work. The contemporary generation of\nseminary trained philosophers in Iran including the prayer leader of\nQum, Ayatullah \u2018Abdullah Javadi Amuli (who has a useful twenty\nvolume commentary on the Four Journeys), are all students of\nthe late \u2018Allama Tabataba\u2019i (d. 1981) who wrote an\ninfluential set of glosses on the work of Mulla Sadra. His school\ndominates the Shi\u2018i seminary in Iran.\n\nHowever, there are other philosophical trends in the contemporary\nperiod that are quite critical of Mulla Sadra\u2019s approach and\nmetaphysics. It took some time for Mulla Sadra to become dominant. The\nAvicennan tradition remained strong throughout the Safavid period and\nbeyond with his own student and son-in-law \u02bfAbd al-Razzaq Lahiji\ndefending Avicennan forms of essentialism, and later father and son\nphilosophers Husayn (d. 1098/1687) and Jamal Khwansari (d. 1125/1714)\ncriticising Mulla Sadra\u2019s concept of mental existence and the\nmodulation of being, explicitly rejecting his positions in their\ncommentaries on the Cure of Avicenna. This Avicennan critique\nof Mulla Sadra remained into the 18th and 19th centuries. Mahdi Naraqi\n(d. 1794) was a prolific glossator on Avicenna and critiqued the\n\u2018mysticising\u2019 approach of Mulla Sadra to metaphysics. \n\nOthers such as Mirza Abu-l-Hasan Jilveh (d. 1896) and his students\ncontinued to defend an ontology of substances and metaphysical\npluralism, while monists such as Muhammad Riza Qumshihi (d. 1888) were\nequally dissatisfied with Mulla Sadra\u2019s attempt to reconcile\nmonism and pluralism. The Shaykhi school established by Shaykh Ahmad\nal-Ahsa\u2019i (d. 1826) took issue with the ontological commitments\nof Mulla Sadra\u2019s semantics of being. A more recent tendency, the\nso-called school of the separation of the religious and secular\nsciences (maktab-i tafkik), accuse Mulla Sadra of conflating\nthe faith and the study of scripture with \u2018Greek science\u2019\nand of violating the literal sense of scriptural verses in pursuit of\nhis philosophical agenda; they argue that Mulla Sadra does not\nrepresent an \u2018authentic\u2019, scripturalist philosophy.\n\nThe modern reception of Mulla Sadra is similar to other great thinkers\nof the past and one can discern at least four types of scholars who\nengage in his thought. First, there are the traditional Shi\u2018i\nseminarians who consider themselves to be disciples of Mulla Sadra and\nhence continuing a scholastic tradition that goes back to the 17th\ncentury. They do not engage his thought critically, nor do they take\nlater critiques of him seriously. We might call them the\ntraditionalists. Second, we find thinkers influenced by analytic\nphilosophy who wish to champion his thought and who attempt to\nreformulate his ideas in terms that would be comprehensible to\nphilosophers from the Anglo-American analytic tradition. In that\nsense, they treat Mulla Sadra similarly to Kant or Locke or Aristotle.\nWe might call them the analyticisers. Third, we have those who insist\nthat Mulla Sadra\u2019s true inclinations were mystical and that\ninstead of attempting to open a dialogue with analytic philosophy, one\nmight find some common ground with continental philosophers but more\nfruitfully with those interested in mysticism and the occult. We might\ncall them the theosophers. Finally, we have scholars engaged with\nMulla Sadra in order to develop their own pride in the achievements of\ntheir Iranian heritage and consider him to be the greatest\nintellectual contribution of Iran. We might call them the nativists.\nThese types are not mutually exclusive. But what is clear is the many\nways in which the legacy of Mulla Sadra is contested and used in the\ncontemporary world. It would be a greater achievement if they took his\nrejection of adhering to authority more seriously and embraced his\nidea of the need to rethink and reanalyse philosophical problems\nfreshly for themselves. That would be a fitting legacy for Mulla Sadra\nin a critical, contemporary age. \n",
