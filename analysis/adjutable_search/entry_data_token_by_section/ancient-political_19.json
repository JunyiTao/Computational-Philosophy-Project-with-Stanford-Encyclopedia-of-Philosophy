Roman aristocrats were\nespecially attracted to the Stoic willingness to countenance the\nkingly and political lives alongside the scholarly one as equally\npreferable (SVF 3.686, translated in LS 67W). They began to\nstudy the Stoa seriously from the late second century BCE. The\naffinity between Stoicism and Roman republicanism was enhanced by the\nsecond-century Stoic teacher Panaetius, who seems to have argued that\nthe Roman mos maiorum or ancient ways and customs were the\nbest form of government, so burnishing philosophical principle with\nthe ancestral piety dear to the Romans. To be sure, in the later\nthroes of civil war, many Stoics would have difficulty in justifying\nassassination of tyrants, insofar as civil war would be worse than\neven a monarchy flouting the law, as one Roman adherent to the school\nwould say in rebuffing Junius Brutus\u2019 attempt to recruit him to\nthe conspiracy to murder Caesar (Plut. Brut. 12. 3\u20134).\nOther Romans were strongly attracted to Epicureanism or to Cynicism,\nand some of these, however paradoxically, likewise played significant\nroles in political life. Thus the distinctive lineaments of the Roman\nrepublic, now to be described, were debated and interpreted by the\nphilosophically minded in terms of Greek political theory; conversely,\nit has been argued that Hellenistic philosophies were significant in\nshaping the ways in which Roman jurists conceived of law (Brouwer\n2021).\n",
