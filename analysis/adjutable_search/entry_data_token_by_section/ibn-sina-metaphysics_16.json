    "main_text": "Causality and Cosmology || Absolute creation\n5.3 Absolute creation\n\nAccording to Avicenna the only way to conceive creation rationally is\nto conceive it as an ontological derivation outside of time. Hence the\nAristotelian model of eternity must be elaborated: the world can be\nboth eternal and created. It can, in fact, be continuously\n(d\u0101\u02beiman) brought into existence, without any\ninterruption or temporal precedence (it is possible and made eternally\nnecessary per aliud by its cause). In this manner Avicenna\nnot only develops Proclus\u2019 idea of an eternal effect, but also\nintegrates the theological concern for an absolute creation: indeed,\nhe intends to ascribe to the divine action the same absoluteness that\nthe idea of creation out of nothing is thought to imply. Using a\nterminology already applied by al-Kind\u012b and distinctly\nreminiscent of Neo-Platonic texts (Janssens 1997), Avicenna states\nthat the philosophers understand \u201ccreation\u201d\n(ibd\u0101\u02bf) as an act of bringing into existence that\ndoes not suppose a world preceded by non-existence (which would mean\nthat creation was placed in time), but nonetheless absolutely excludes\nthat same possibility of non-existence (Marmura 1984; Janssens 1987;\nLizzini 2011):\n\n\nThis is the meaning that philosophers\n(al-\u1e25ukam\u0101\u02be) term \u201cinstauration\u201d\n(ibd\u0101\u02bf): it is to make the thing be\n(ta\u02bey\u012bs al-\u0161ay\u02be) after an absolute\nnon-being (ba\u02bfda lays mu\u1e6dlaq). In fact, it belongs\nto the effect in itself to be non-being (lays),\nwhile because of its cause it belongs to it to be \u201cbeing\u201d\n(ays). And what belongs to the thing in itself is prior in\nthe mind (\u1e0fihn)\u2014as regards essence, not as\nregards time\u2014to that which is because of something\nother than itself. Here then each caused [thing] \u201cis\u201d\n(ays) after \u201cnot being\u201d (lays),\naccording to a posteriority in essence (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t,\nVI, 2, 266, 12\u201315).\n\n\nIt is precisely on the basis of the problematic identification of\npossibility and non-existence (here lays elsewhere also\n\u02bfadam: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 3, 342,\n6\u2013343, 6) that Avicenna shapes his idea of the divine flow in\nopposition to the theological conception of creation in time: for him\nnon-existence is what the possible in itself deserves. Reworking the\nAristotelian ideas of anteriority and agent causality, he ascribes to\nthe creation by the First Principle (with the consequent non-existence\nof the effect) not a temporal but an essential anteriority (Marmura\n1984). A non-existence that is prior in time would refute the\nabsoluteness of creation because it would, contradictorily, posit\nnon-existence. Moreover, this would explain a relative\ncreation\u2014a \u201ccertain causing to be\u201d\n(ta\u02bey\u012bs m\u0101)\u2014but not an absolute\ninstauration. The principle according to which Avicenna excludes time\nin the instaurative act of the First Principle is the same one that\nleads him to exclude any mediation: in order to be truly and\nabsolutely that which makes things existent, the First Principle must\nperform an act that is free of any mediation; as Avicenna states in\nthe Kit\u0101b al-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t (Duny\u0101, III\nvol., 95), creation is not conceivable in terms of time because a time\nbefore the creative act of God would end up being an intermediate\nbetween the First Principle and the world:\n\n\nInstauration (ibd\u0101\u02bf) [signifies that] from the\nthing [is derived] existence for [something] other than it, which\ndepends on it alone, without an intermediary [such as] matter, or an\ninstrument or a time. On the contrary, what is preceded by a temporal\nnon-existence does not do without an intermediary. Instauration is of\na higher rank than generation (takw\u012bn) and than bringing\n[the thing] into being in time (i\u1e25d\u0101t).\n\n\nThe action of the First Cause must therefore be conceived as exempt\nfrom any mediation. Nothing (neither a matter, nor an act of will, nor\neven time) can be inserted between the Principle and Its effect (see\nalso \u1e24ud\u016bd: 42\u201343). An image often occurs in\nAvicenna\u2019s writings: the causality of the First Principle is\nsimilar to that of the hand that moves the key in the lock of a door:\nthe movement of the hand and that of the key\u2014respectively the\ncause and the effect\u2014are simultaneous, and yet one is prior to\nthe other. Priority is essential, not temporal\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 1, 165).\n",
