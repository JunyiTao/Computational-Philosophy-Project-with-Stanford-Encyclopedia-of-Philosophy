Authorship\n\nThe authors introduce themselves as a kind of\n\u201cbrotherhood\u201d (ma\u2018\u00e2shara) of sages.\nTheir work is addressed to \u201cbeginners,\u201d who may thereby\nincrease their knowledge. The literary scholar Ab\u00fb Hayy\u00e2n\nal-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee (922-32/1023), basing his work on the ideas of\nhis master Ab\u00fb Sulaym\u00e2n al-Mantiq\u00ee (c. 912/c. 985),\nand the mu\u2018tazili theologian \u2018Abd al-Jabb\u00e2r\nal-Hamad\u00e2n\u00ee (c. 936/1025) have identified the names of\nthese authors. They are understood to be the q\u00e2d\u00ee\nAbu \u2019l-Hasan \u2018Al\u00ee b. H\u00e2r\u00fbn\nal-Zanj\u00e2n\u00ee and his three friends, Ab\u00fb Sulaym\u00e2n\nMuhammad b. Ma\u2018shar al-Bust\u00ee, called al-Maqdis\u00ee,\nAb\u00fb Ahmad al-Nahraj\u00fbr\u00ee and al-\u2018Awf\u00ee. All\nof these men came from Basra and were linked to the Chancellery\nsecretary Zayd b. Rif\u00e2\u2018a (cf. Stern, 1946; Stern,\n1964).The text of al-Tawh\u00eed\u00ee is accurately examined in\nKraemer 1986, 136, 230 ff. This authorship is now questioned by\nseveral scholars, because the learned who transmitted the Epistles to\nal-Andalus appears to be Maslama al-Qurtub\u00ee\nal-Majr\u00eet\u00ee, not later than the first half of the\n10th century.\n",
