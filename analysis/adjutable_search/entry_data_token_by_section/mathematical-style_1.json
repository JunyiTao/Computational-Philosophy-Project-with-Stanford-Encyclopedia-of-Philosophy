Style as a central concept in comparative cultural histories\n\nNotwithstanding the previous caveats, it is a fact that some major\ntwentieth century appeals to the category of style in mathematics have\ndone so in reference to the arts. This is especially true of those\nauthors who were motivated by accounting in a unified way for the\ncultural production of mankind and who saw thus a uniformity in the\nprocesses of scientific and artistic production. It was in such\ncontext that Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West\n(1919, 1921) attempted a morphology of world history and claimed that\nthe history of mathematics was characterized by different stylistic\nepochs which depended on the culture that produced it:\n\nThe Style of any mathematics which comes into being, depends wholly on\nthe Culture in which it is rooted, the sort of mankind it is that\nponders it. The soul can bring its inherent possibilities to\nscientific development, can manage them practically, can attain the\nhighest levels in its treatment of them\u2014but is quite impotent to\nalter them. The idea of the Euclidean geometry is actualized in the\nearliest forms of Classical ornament, and that of the Infinitesimal\nCalculus in the earliest forms of Gothic architecture, centuries\nbefore the first learned mathematicians of the respective Cultures\nwere born. (Spengler 1919, 59)\n\n\nNot only are there parallels between mathematics and other artistic\nproductions of a culture. Relying on Goethe\u2019s statement that the\ncomplete mathematician \u201cfeels within himself the beauty of the\ntrue\u201d and on Weierstrass\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cwho\nis not at the same time a bit of a poet will never be a true\nmathematician\u201d, Spengler went on to characterize mathematics\nitself as an art:\n\nMathematics, then, is an art. As such it has its styles and style\nperiods. It is not, as the layman and the philosopher (who is in this\nmatter a layman too) imagine, substantially unalterable, but subject\nlike every art to unnoticed changes from epoch to epoch. (Spengler\n1919, 62)\n\n\nThe most extensive treatment that builds on the parallel between art\nand mathematics and exploits the notion of style as a central category\nfor an analysis of the history of mathematics is that of Max Bense. In\na book appropriately entitled Konturen einer Geistesgeschichte der\nMathematik (1946), Bense devoted a whole chapter (ch. 2) to\narticulating how the notion of style applies to mathematics. For Bense\nstyle is form:\n\nFor style is form, essential form, and we designate this form as the\n\u201cAesthetic\u201d, if it controls categorially the sensible, a\nmaterial. (Bense 1946, 118)\n\n\nBense saw the history of art and the history of mathematics as aspects\nof the history of mind [Geistesgeschichte]. In fact\n\u201cstyle is given wherever the human imagination and the capacity\nof expression arrive to creation\u201d. Bense was certainly prone to\ndraw parallels between styles in the history of art and styles in\nmathematics (he especially treated the baroque and the romantic styles\nin his book) but he kept, in opposition to Spengler, the nature of art\nand mathematics separate. Indeed he recognized that a stylistic\nhistory of mathematics could not be reduced \u201cto a coincidence\nbetween certain mathematical formal tendencies and the great\nartistic-worldviews-spiritual styles of single epochs such as the\nRenaissance, Classicism, the Baroque or Romanticism\u201d (p.132; see\nFleckenstein 1955 and Wisan 1981 for more recent parallels between the\nbaroque in art and the mathematics of the seventeenth century). He\nreferred to Felix Klein\u2019s \u201cElementarmathematik vom\nh\u00f6heren Standpunkte aus\u201d to point out that certain\nlines of development characterized by Klein could be seen as pointing\nto styles in the history of the development of mathematics (see Klein\n1924, 91).\n\nAttempts such as Spengler\u2019s and Bense\u2019s appeal certainly\nto those theoreticians who would like to use the category of style as\na tool for describing, and perhaps accounting for, cultural patterns.\nHowever, they leave the reader who is knowledgeable in mathematics\nand/or history of art skeptical on account of the usually far-fetched\nparallels that are supposed to provide evidence for the account. Of\ncourse, this is not to reject ultimately the approach or the\nusefulness of the appropriateness of the category of style in\nmathematics but one would like its use to be more directly related to\naspects of mathematical practice. A recent attempt at connecting the notions of style in literature and in mathematics is van Bengedem and van Kerkhove 2014.\n\nIn general, one can distinguish two types of theorizing that can be\nassociated with such attempts. The first is purely descriptive, or\ntaxonomic, and satisfies itself with showing certain common patterns\nbetween a certain area of thought, such as mathematics, and other\ncultural products of a certain society. The second approach\npresupposes the first but also enquires after the causes that account\nfor the presence of a certain style of thought or production and\nnormally tries to ascribe it to psychological or sociological factors.\nIn Spengler and Bense there are elements of both although the emphasis\nis more on the parallels than on the causes underlying or explaining\nthe parallels.\n\nAttempts to extend the use of the concept of style in art to other\ndomains of human endeavors abound in the early twentieth century. A\nwell-known case is Mannheim\u2019s sociological attempt to\ncharacterize styles of thought within different social groups\n(Mannheim 1928). While Mannheim had not excluded scientific thought\nfrom the realm of sociological analysis of knowledge, he did not\nactively pursue such an analysis. By contrast, Ludwik Fleck practiced\na sociological analysis of science in which \u201cstyles of\nthought\u201d played a central role. Fleck focused however on\nmedicine (Fleck 1935).\n\nHere it is important to point out that the notion of thought style has\nreceived, by and large, two different developments in contemporary\nresearch, which also affect mathematics. First, there is the notion\nencountered in Fleck. Depending on how generous one wants to be in\ndrawing connections, one could see this approach to styles of thought\nto be related to the later work by Kuhn, Foucault and Hacking (see\nbelow for a discussion of Hacking). There is however a different way\nof thinking about styles of thought, which usually goes under the name\nof cognitive styles. This is an area of interest to cognitive\npsychologists and mathematical educators (for an overview of the\npsychological research in this area see Riding 2000 and Stenberg and\nGrigorenko 2001). Here the focus is on the psychological make up of\nthe individual who displays preference for a certain cognitive style\neither in learning, understanding or thinking about mathematics (i.e.,\nprocessing and organizing mathematical information). The old\ndistinction between visual and analytic mathematicians emphasized by\nPoincar\u00e9 (see Poincar\u00e9 1905) is still part of the\npicture although there are a great variety of models and\nclassifications. For an historical overview and a theoretical proposal\ncentered on mathematics see Borromeo Ferri 2005.\n\nIn the area of history and philosophy of mathematics there are no book\nlength accounts of mathematical styles that explain the emergence of a\ncertain style with sociological or psychological categories (although\nNetz 1999 has been of interest to theoreticians of style as an attempt\nat a cognitive history of an important segment of Greek mathematics).\nThis is in contrast to books in history of the natural sciences such\nas Harwood 1993, whose goal is to explain the emergence of the thought\nstyle of the German genetics community through sociological arguments.\nThe closest one comes to such an account is Bieberbach\u2019s\nconception of style in mathematics as dependent on psychological and\nracial factors. He will be discussed in the next section on national\nstyles.\n",
