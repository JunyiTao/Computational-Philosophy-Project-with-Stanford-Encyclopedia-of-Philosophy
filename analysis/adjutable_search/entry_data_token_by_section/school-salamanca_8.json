    "main_text": "Economic Theory\n7. Economic Theory\n\nAlongside the debates on just war, colonization and the slave trade,\neconomics is perhaps the most striking example of how the theologians\nfrom the School of Salamanca used and transformed traditional medieval\ntheories in order to deal with new situations, creating innovative\nsolutions that had long-lasting influence. They have often been\nmentioned as the ancestors of the Austrian School of Economics, which\nin the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries emphasized the role of\nthe consumer\u2019s estimation in the development of prices and the\nimportance of the market against any attempt of rationally planning\neconomic processes, while Molina has been described as a \u201csolid\neconomic liberal\u201d (Rothbard 1995 [2006: 113]). This may be a\nrestrictive interpretation, because there is an undeniable relevance\nof the medieval heritage with its rigid condemnation of usury to be\nfound in the authors from the School of Salamanca. Their views on\neconomy are founded in natural law, implying therefore a normative\nview of economic processes instead of the purely strategic rationality\nof a homo oeconomicus. Nonetheless, the general consensus is\nthat there are liberal elements in late Scholastic economics\n(Sch\u00fcssler 2014). Among the topics they dealt with were public\nfinance, the danger of exhausting public treasuries and of excessive\ntaxes (Chafuen 2003: 53\u201360), the just price for different goods\nand the problem of charging interest for lending money, which was\nconnected to the traditional condemnation of usury. The exchange of\nmoney was another major issue, because there were a large number of\nmonetary systems simultaneously in use within the Spanish and\nPortuguese kingdoms. According to Marjory Grice-Hutchinson, who\npublished an early and still important volume on their monetary\ntheory, the original contribution of the School of Salamanca in this\nfield consists \n\n\nin its formulation of a psychological theory of value applied to both\ngoods and money, of the quantity theory, and of a theory of foreign\nexchange that closely resembles the modern purchasing-power parity\ntheory. (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 47\u201348)\n\n\nA more or less common view of Spanish Scholastics on just price is\nthat the value of goods\u2014and money\u2014depends on estimation,\nnot primarily on the costs of production, nor on the needs of buyers\n(Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 48\u201351). It is not the communis\naestimatio of theologians that determines the natural price, but\nrather that of businessmen, as Molina says (De iustitia et\niure II 407); and it is not a fixed margin, but moves within a\ncertain range, depending also on the quantity of goods and money\navailable. Monopolies are criticized by Molina because they make such\na determination of just price impossible (ibid., II 345). Some authors\nargued for a public limitation on the price of foodstuffs. Molina\nfavored support of the poor but hesitated to make only corn dealers\npay for it, because a fixed price would prevent merchants from\nimporting corn, thus damaging the common good (ibid., II 365).\n\nThe first formulation of the quantity theory of money is often\nattributed to the jurist Martin de Azpilcueta, perhaps the best known\nSalamancan writer on economic issues. In an appendix to his manual for\nconfessors, now published as On Exchange (2014), he discussed\nexchange, supply and demand, and money. Azpilcueta attempted to\nexplain the rampant inflation of the sixteenth century as connected to\nthe large-scale importation of specie from the New World. Goods, he\nargued, were more costly when money was abundant. This quantity theory\nof money was widely accepted throughout Europe.\n\nAzpilcueta, moreover, maintained that the exchange of money is not\nunnatural, contradicting Aristotle and many Scholastics. He treated\nmoney like other merchandise, positing that the morality of exchanges\nwhich were not dependent on money as their object was equitable. There\nwere different questions connected to exchange. One of these was\nwhether, in the case of petty exchange, it was licit to take more than\nthe legally fixed commission; this view was rejected, and the legal\ncommission was seen as binding in conscience (Alonso-Lasheras 2011:\n172\u2013173.). Another problem arose in relation to exchange bills\nbecause the value of money varied considerably between different\nplaces within the Spanish Empire, offering new possibilities of making\nand losing money. Spanish writers such as Azpilcueta and Molina\ncountered the suspicion of usury associated with this kind of business\nby means of an early version of purchasing power theory according to\nwhich the exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when\ntheir purchasing power, i.e., what can be bought with a certain amount\nof money, remains the same (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 52\u201353;\nAlonso-Lasheras 2011: 179). Concerning the topic of lending money,\nauthors like Molina justified taking interest, first, by the\nlucrum cessans, the amount of money that the lender could\nhave made during the time it was on loan as a credit and, then, by the\npericulum sortis, the risk that he might lose his capital\n(Molina, De iustitia et iure II 315).\n\nDespite the liberal elements which can be found in the works of\nauthors from the School of Salamanca, they nevertheless had a\ncompletely different understanding of the market from that of modern\nneoliberals. \n\n\nThe market was first of all a physical place in which real people came\ntogether. These people possessed a moral conscience that was also part\nof the economic process. (Alonso-Lasheras 2011: 169)\n\n",
