Most physicists, but not all,\ntend to view their science as an enterprise which accumulates\nknowledge in a continuous manner. For example, they would not say that\nclassical mechanics has been disproved by relativistic mechanics, but\nthat relativistic mechanics has partly clarified where classical\nmechanics could be safely applied and where not. This view of the\ndevelopment of physics has been challenged by some philosophers and\nhistorians of science, especially by the writings of T. Kuhn and P.\nFeyerabend. These scholars emphasize the conceptual discontinuity or\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d between reduced theory \\(T\\) and\nreducing theory \\(T'\\). The structuralistic accounts of reduction now\nopens the possibility of discussing these matters on a less informal\nlevel. The preliminary results of this discussion are different\ndepending on the particular program.\n",
