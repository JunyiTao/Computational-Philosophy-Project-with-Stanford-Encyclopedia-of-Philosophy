    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning || The Theory-Ladenness of Observation\n3.3 The Theory-Ladenness of Observation\n\nOne traditional debate in the philosophy of science is whether\nscientific observation is permeated with the theory of the scientist,\nor theory-laden (see the entry on \n theory and observation in science). \n As Raftopoulos and Zeimbekis point out, when\nasking whether observation is theory-laden, the answer will depend in\npart on what it means for a subject to possess a theory (2015: 18). On\ntheir view, theories can be tacit, rather than just \u201chaving a\nset of beliefs and concepts\u201d (p. 18).\n\nAssuming that theories can be held tacitly, perceptual learning might\nplausibly play a role in making observation theory laden. Raftopoulos\nand Zeimbekis, for instance, ask us to imagine a scientist who has\nundergone perceptual learning in her expert domain (2015: 19).\nSpecifically, through repeated exposure to items in her expert domain,\nshe has developed perceptual sensitivity to certain features, in\naccordance with her professional needs. This includes learned\nattention to particular dimensions, and involves physical changes\nearly in her visual system (p. 19). As a result, the scientist might\nquite literally see the world differently within her expert domain\nthan someone from outside her expertise would see it.\n\nSuch a case suggests that perceptual learning can make observation\ntheory-laden. The scientist\u2019s perceptual system comes to shape\nthe kind of visual information that makes it into the\nscientist\u2019s conscious perception, and does so based on her\nprofessional needs. As Raftopoulos and Zeimbekis put it, the case\nsuggests \n\n\nthat non-cognitive, clearly perceptual influences on incoming visual\ninformation can be indirect bearers of the kinds of theoretical\ncommitments that we usually think of as the content of conceptually\ncouched theories. (2015: 19) \n\n\nAlthough the case does not involve explicit beliefs directly\ninfluencing perception, arguably it involves a theory being held\ntacitly and appropriated into one\u2019s perceptual system.\n",
