    "main_text": "Varieties of Institutionalism || Neo-Republicanism as an Institutionalist Theory\n3.3 Neo-Republicanism as an Institutionalist Theory\n\nIn recent years, the debate about institutions and justice has\nbroadened significantly. Some, as we will discuss in section 4, have\nbegun to question whether institutions are all that significant from\nthe standpoint of justice. Others, however, have begun to expand the\ntoolkit with which global institutions are to be judged. The\nresurgence of republican thought in recent years has offered an\nopportunity for thinkers concerned with domination to examine how\nglobal institutions might be understood from the standpoint of\nrepublican justice. In this section, we will lay out the basic tenets\nof neo-republicanism and explain the major positions that have been\nstaked out in their application to issues of global concern.\n\nNeo-republicanism (see entry)\n is a family of views that emphasizes the close connection between\njustice and a particular kind of freedom. Namely, the purpose of\nsocial institutions is to protect us from domination by others and to\nensure we can act independently from the wills of others. Unlike\nfreedom from interference, freedom from domination is specifically\nabout the power relation: a slaveowner who could interfere with her\nslaves but chooses not is still constraining their freedom. In this\ncase, slaves are not free from the will of their owner even if they\nhappen to live their lives mostly without interference. Thus,\ndomination is a worry whenever one agent has superior power over\nanother and can asymmetrically influence the choice situation of the\nweaker agent. However, it is sometimes, even usually, the case that we\ncannot eliminate differentials in social position or power, but one\ncan be subject to superior power without being dominated if the\nexercise of that power is suitably constrained or directed. There is a\nfair amount of disagreement over the precise nature of these\nconstraints, but neo-republicans have converged on a set of\ninstitutional prescriptions that ensure that citizens are not merely\nsubject to power: the rule of law, constitutional protections,\ndemocracy, due process, and the provision of a social minimum at the\nvery least. These institutional structures have a two-fold objective.\nFirst, they constrain state power such that there is no public\ndomination. Second, they direct state power effectively towards its\njustificatory purpose: governing the relations between citizens such\nthat there is no private domination. These purposes can only be\nachieved within a republican constitutional order and so freedom is\nonly possible in the state. This is, perhaps, the key idea behind\nrepublicanism: we do not give up freedom in order to achieve the\nsecurity of citizenship in a state, citizenship in a state is a\nprecondition of freedom.\n\nGiven the neo-republican focus on the moral necessity of citizenship\nin a constitutional order, it is unsurprising that most\nneo-republicans have adopted a view that is functionally similar to\nthe right institutionalists (Pettit 2010; Laborde & Ronzoni \n2015; Smith forthcoming).\nThe state is the primary site of distributive justice and the purpose\nof international institutions is to ensure that each state has the\nability to ensure non-domination within its borders and to prevent\nstates from dominating other states. This commitment is driven by\nconsiderations that are primarily non-ideal. Many statist\nneo-republicans have no principled objection to a world republic and\nmay even find that institutional structure preferable under ideal\nconditions. Yet, they view a more robustly republican global order as\nsimply too far away and difficult to achieve for the ideal case to be\naction-guiding.\n\nA smaller but growing group of neo-republicans fit more in the mold of\nleft institutionalists (Laborde 2010; Bohman 2004; Buckinx 2011).\nGenerally, left institutionalist neo-republicans are impressed by\n\u201cexpansion\u201d arguments that purport to show that the\nconsiderations that motivate us to be concerned about coercion,\ncooperation, or domination at the domestic level apply to issues of\nglobal governance. These left republicans do not expect or want the\nstate to \u201cwither away\u201d but rather think that direct\nprotections against domination at the level of regional or global\ngovernance are necessary. In general, left republicans are\u2014at\nleast on global justice issues\u2014less optimistic about the ability\nof even well-ordered states to manage their affairs in the face of\nglobal coordination problems from climate change to immigration and\nthus argue that global governance regimes need to be designed with\ntheir own republican principles in mind and not treated as mere\nadjuncts to state capacity.\n\nFinally, both left and right neo-republicans are\u2014and need\nto\u2014engage with a deeper conceptual issue: the republican world\nstate. Jacobin republicans, for example, believed that if the civil\ncondition between citizens was morally necessary, then a civil\ncondition between states was equally necessary (Kleingeld 2011). This\nseems to suggest that the world state is morally necessary. Most\nneo-republican objections to the world state concern its lack of\nfeasibility. This means that left and right republicans are both\nallied in suggesting that the improbability of the world republican\nstate is sufficient to warrant its rejection as an institutional\nobjective. Yet it is unclear whether these feasibility concerns,\nborrowed from Kant, are as quite as substantial as they appear\n(Deudney 2006) and it is also unclear why they should be so decisive\nin our normative theorizing even if they were (Gilabert 2017). There\nis a worrisome asymmetry in the neo-republican discussions of\nfeasibility in the context of global justice: a modern state with the\nrule of law and reliable welfare provision would have been viewed as\nquite unfeasible in the early modern period and yet this did not\nprevent republicans from pushing for those institutional norms over\ntime. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a key feature of future neo-republican\ntheorizing about global justice will concern the appropriate mixture\nof ideal and non-ideal assumptions and the use of feasibility\njudgments when it comes to making normative prescriptions.\n",
