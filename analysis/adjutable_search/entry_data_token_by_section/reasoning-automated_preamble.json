    "main_text": "\n\nReasoning is the ability to make inferences, and automated reasoning\nis concerned with the building of computing systems that automate this\nprocess. Although the overall goal is to mechanize different forms of\nreasoning, the term has largely been identified with valid deductive\nreasoning as practiced in mathematics and formal logic. In this\nrespect, automated reasoning is akin to mechanical theorem proving.\nBuilding an automated reasoning program means providing an algorithmic\ndescription to a formal calculus so that it can be implemented on a\ncomputer to prove theorems of the calculus in an efficient manner.\nImportant aspects of this exercise involve defining the class of\nproblems the program will be required to solve, deciding what language\nwill be used by the program to represent the information given to it\nas well as new information inferred by the program, specifying the\nmechanism that the program will use to conduct deductive inferences,\nand figuring out how to perform all these computations efficiently.\nWhile basic research work continues in order to provide the necessary\ntheoretical framework, the field has reached a point where automated\nreasoning programs are being used by researchers to attack open\nquestions in mathematics and logic, provide important applications in\ncomputing science, solve problems in engineering, and find novel\napproaches to questions in exact philosophy. \n",
