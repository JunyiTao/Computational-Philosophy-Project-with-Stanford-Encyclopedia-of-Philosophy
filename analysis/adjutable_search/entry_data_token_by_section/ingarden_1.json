    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics\n2. Ontology and Metaphysics\n\n\nMost of Ingarden\u2019s major work focuses on ontology, which he\nconsiders a purely a priori enterprise, concerned not with\nwhat actually exists, but with what could possibly exist (which\nconcepts are non-contradictory), and with what (according to the\ncontents of the relevant ideas) it would take for objects of various\nkinds to exist, or entail if they existed. He thus contrasts ontology\nwith metaphysics, which is concerned with answering factual questions\nabout what sorts of things actually exist and what they are like.\nOntology, in Ingarden\u2019s hands, thus bears close resemblance to the\nsorts of conceptual analysis that became common in analytic philosophy\nin roughly the same period. Ingarden\u2019s work on the ontology of art is\nontological in this sense, e.g. he attempts to determine, by analysis\nof the essential meanings of experiences that could present something\nas a work of literature, music, or architecture, what sort of an entity\nsuch an object would have to be to satisfy those experiences and\nmeanings, and how it would have to relate to consciousness and physical\nobjects.\n\n\nIn his Habilitationscrhift, Essentiale Fragen (Essential Questions) from 1925 Ingarden \u201cpaves the way for his future metaphysics of the world\u201d, such as he later develops in The Controversy over the Existence of the World (de Santis 2015). In Essential Questions, the focus is on different ways in which one may ask questions about essences. Ingarden assumes (as was characteristic in the phenomenological tradition) that there is a correlation between types of judgment and entities judged about. He thus uses the differences in the sorts of judgments that would answer the various questions as the basis for distinguishing different categories of Ideas. (For further discussion, see de Santis 2015, Ryle 1927). \n",
