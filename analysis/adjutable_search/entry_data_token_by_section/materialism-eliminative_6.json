    "main_text": "Arguments For Eliminative Materialism || General Theoretical Problems With Folk Psychology\n3.1 General Theoretical Problems With Folk Psychology\n\nPatricia and Paul Churchland have offered a number of arguments based\non general considerations about theory evaluation. For example, they\nhave argued that any promising and accurate theory should offer a\nfertile research program with considerable explanatory power. They\nnote, however, that common-sense psychology appears to be stagnant,\nand there is a broad range of mental phenomena that folk psychology\ndoes not allow us to explain. Questions about why we dream, various\naspects of mental illness, consciousness, memory and learning are\ncompletely ignored by folk psychology. According to the Churchlands,\nthese considerations indicate that folk psychology may be in much\nworse shape than we commonly recognize (P. M. Churchland, 1981; P.S.\nChurchland, 1986). Another argument that appeals to general\ntheoretical considerations offers an inductive inference based on the\npast record of folk theories. Folk physics, folk biology, folk\nepidemiology and the like all proved to be radically mistaken. Since\nfolk theories generally turn out to be mistaken, it seems quite\nimprobable that folk psychology will turn out true. Indeed, since folk\npsychology concerns a subject that is far more complex and difficult\nthan any past folk theory, it seems wildly implausible that this one\ntime we actually got things right (Churchland, P.M. 1981). \n\nThese general theoretical arguments do not seem to have significantly\nundermined the intuitive support that folk psychology enjoys. In\nresponse to the charge that folk psychology is stagnant, many have\nargued that this assessment is unfair, and that folk psychology has\nactually stimulated a number of fruitful research programs in\nscientific psychology (Greenwood, 1991; Horgan and Woodward, 1985).\nMoreover, defenders of folk psychology note that it hardly follows\nfrom the observation that a given theory is incomplete, or fails to\nexplain everything, that it is therefore radically false (Horgan and\nWoodward, 1985). Defenders of folk psychology object that these\ntheoretical considerations cannot outweigh the evidence provided by\neveryday, ordinary experience of our own minds, such as our\nintrospective experience, which seems to vividly support the reality\nof mental states like beliefs.\n\nRegarding this last point, eliminativists like the Churchlands warn\nthat we should be deeply suspicious about the reliability of\nintrospective \u201cevidence\u201d about the inner workings of the\nmind. If inner observation is as theory-laden as many now suppose\nouter perception to be, what we introspect may be largely determined\nby our folk psychological framework. In other words,\n\u201cintrospecting\u201d beliefs may be just like people\n\u201cseeing\u201d demonic spirits or celestial spheres (Churchland,\nP.M., 1988). This skepticism about the reliability of introspection is\nbolstered by empirical work that calls into question the reliability\nof introspection (Nisbett and Wilson, 1977). As we will see in Section\n3.3, the idea that introspection offers an illusory image of the mind\nis gaining popularity not just with regard to information bearing\nstates like beliefs, but also with regard to phenomenal states like\nqualia.\n",
