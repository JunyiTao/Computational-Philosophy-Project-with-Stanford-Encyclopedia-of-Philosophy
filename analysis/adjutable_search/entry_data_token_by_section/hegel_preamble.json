    "main_text": "\nAlong with J.G. Fichte and, at least in his early work, F.W.J.  von\nSchelling, Hegel (1770\u20131831) belongs to the period of German\nidealism in the decades following Kant. The most systematic of the\npost-Kantian idealists, Hegel attempted, throughout his published\nwritings as well as in his lectures, to elaborate a comprehensive and\nsystematic philosophy from a purportedly logical starting point. He is\nperhaps most well-known for his teleological account of history, an\naccount that was later taken over by Marx and \u201cinverted\u201d\ninto a materialist theory of an historical development culminating in\ncommunism. While idealist philosophies in Germany post-dated\nHegel (Beiser 2014), the movement commonly known as German idealism\neffectively ended with Hegel\u2019s death. Certainly since the\nrevolutions in logical thought from the turn of the twentieth century,\nthe logical side of Hegel\u2019s thought has been largely forgotten,\nalthough his political and social philosophy and theological views\nhave continued to find interest and support. Since the 1970s, however,\na degree of more general philosophical interest in Hegel\u2019s\nsystematic thought and its logical basis has been revived.\n",
