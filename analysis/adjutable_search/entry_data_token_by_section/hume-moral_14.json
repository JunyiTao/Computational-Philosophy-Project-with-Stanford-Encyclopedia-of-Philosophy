    "main_text": "The Natural Virtues\n14. Differences between the Treatise and the Moral Enquiry\n\n\nLate in his life Hume deemed the Enquiry concerning the Principles\nof Morals his best work, and in style it is a model of elegance\nand subtlety. His method in that work differs from that of the\nTreatise: instead of explicating the nature of virtue and vice\nand our knowledge of them in terms of underlying features of the human\nmind, he proposes to collect all the traits we know from common sense\nto be virtues and vices, observe what those in each group have in\ncommon, and from that observation discover the \u201cfoundation of\nethics\u201d (EPM 1.10). The conclusions largely coincide with those\nof the Treatise. Some topics in the Treatise are\nhandled more fully in the moral Enquiry; for example Hume\u2019s\naccount of the motive to just action is enriched by his discussion\nof a challenge from a \u201csensible knave.\u201d However, without\nthe detailed background theories of the mind, the passions, motivation\nto action, and social convention presented in the Treatise,\nand without any substitute for them, some of the conclusions of the\nmoral Enquiry stand unsupported.\n\n\nIn the latter work, Hume\u2019s main argument that reason alone is not\nadequate to yield moral evaluations (in Appendix 1) depends on\nhis having demonstrated throughout the book that at least one\nfoundation of moral praise lies in the usefulness to society of the\npraised character trait. We use reason extensively to learn the effects\nof various traits and to identify the useful and pernicious ones. But\nutility and disutility are merely means; were we indifferent to the\nweal and woe of mankind, we would feel equally indifferent to the\ntraits that promote those ends. Therefore there must be some sentiment\nthat makes us favor the one over the other. This could only be\nhumanity, \u201ca feeling for the happiness of mankind, and resentment\nof their misery\u201d (EPM App. 1.3). This argument presupposes that\nthe moral evaluations we make are themselves the expression of\nsentiment rather than reason alone. (The alternative position would be\nthat while of course we do feel approval and disapproval for vice and\nvirtue, the judgment as to which is which is itself the deliverance of\nreason.) So Hume appends some arguments directed against the hypothesis\nof moral rationalism. One of these is an enriched version of the\nargument of Treatise 3.1.1 that neither demonstrative nor causal\nreasoning has moral distinctions as its proper object, since moral vice\nand virtue cannot plausibly be analyzed as either facts or relations.\nHe adds that while in our reasonings we start from the knowledge of\nrelations or facts and infer some previously-unknown relation or fact,\nmoral evaluation cannot proceed until all the relevant facts and\nrelations are already known. At that point, there is nothing further\nfor reason to do; therefore moral evaluation is not the work of reason\nalone but of another faculty. He bolsters this line of argument by\nexpanding his Treatise analogy between moral and aesthetic\njudgment, arguing that just as our appreciation of beauty awaits full\ninformation about the object but requires the further contribution of\ntaste, so in moral evaluation our assessment of merit or villainy\nawaits full knowledge of the person and situation but requires the\nfurther contribution of approbation or disapprobation. He also offers\nthe argument that since the chain of reasons why one acts must finally\nstop at something that is \u201cdesirable on its own account\u2026\nbecause of its immediate accord or agreement with\nsentiment\u2026\u201d (EPM App.1.19), sentiment is needed to account\nfor ultimate human ends; and since virtue is an end, sentiment and not\nreason alone must distinguish moral good and evil.\n\n\nIn the moral Enquiry Hume omits all arguments to show that\nreason alone does not move us to act; so the Representation\nArgument about the irrelevance of reason to passions and actions is absent.\nWithout it he has no support for his direct\nargument that moral goodness and evil are not identical with\nreasonableness and unreasonableness, which relies on it for its key\npremise; and that too is absent from EPM. On the whole in EPM Hume\ndoes not appeal to the thesis that reason cannot produce motives in\norder to show that morals are not derived from reason alone, but\nlimits himself to the epistemic and descriptive arguments showing that\nreason alone cannot discern virtue and vice in order to reject ethical\nrationalism in favor of sentimentalism.  However, at Appendix I.21 he\ndoes assert (without support) that \u201cReason, being cool and disengaged,\nis no motive to action,\u201d and perhaps this is intended to be a premise\nin a revised version of the famous argument that reason cannot produce\nmotives but morals can, though what he writes here is tantalizingly\ndifferent from that argument as it appears repeatedly in\nthe Treatise.\n\n\nWhy did Hume omit the more fundamental arguments for the\nmotivational inertia of reason? He may have reconsidered and rejected\nthem. For example, he may have given up his undefended claim that\npassions have no representative character, a premise of the\nRepresentation Argument on which, as we saw, some of his fundamental\nanti-rationalist arguments depend. Or he may have retained these views\nbut opted not to appeal to anything so arcane in a work aimed at a\nbroader audience and intended to be as accessible as possible. The\nmoral Enquiry makes no use of ideas and impressions, and so no\narguments that depend on that distinction can be offered there,\nincluding the Representation Argument. Apparently Hume thought he could\nshow that reason and sentiment rule different domains without using\nthose arguments.\n\n\nThus, not surprisingly, the causal analysis of sympathy as a mechanism\nof vivacity-transferal from the impression of the self to the ideas of\nthe sentiments of others is entirely omitted from the moral\nEnquiry. Hume still appeals to sympathy there to explain the\norigin of all moral approval and disapproval, but he explains our\nsympathy with others simply as a manifestation of the sentiment of\nhumanity, which is given more prominence. He is still concerned about the objection that sympathetically-acquired sentiments vary with spatial and temporal distance from the\nobject of evaluation while moral assessments do not; so he addresses it in the moral Enquiry as well,\nand resolves it by appealing once again to the common point of view.\nIn the Enquiry he places more emphasis on sympathy with the interests of the whole of society, in part achieved by conversation using shared moral vocabulary,\nas a way to correct our initial sentiments to make them genuinely moral (Taylor 2002). He also attends more explicitly to the role of reason and reflection in moral evaluation. Some interpreters see him as offering an account of how to arrive at reliable moral judgment superior to that in the Treatise (Taylor 2015). \n\n\nThe distinction between artificial and natural virtues that\ndominates the virtue ethics of the Treatise is almost entirely\nabsent from the moral Enquiry; the term \u2018artificial\u2019\noccurs in the latter only once in a footnote. Gone are the paradoxes of\nproperty and promises intended to prove that particular virtues are\ndevised on purpose; also missing is what some commentators think Hume\u2019s\nmost original contribution to the theory of justice, his account of\nconvention. Yet Hume briefly sketches part of the same \nquasi-historical account of the origin of justice that he gives in the\nTreatise; and while the emphasis has shifted, Hume not only\ntries to show that justice has merit only because of its beneficial\nconsequences, but that \u201cpublic utility is the sole\norigin of justice\u201d \u2014 were we not to find it useful (and in\nsome conditions we might not) we would not even have such a thing (EPM\n3.1.1). While any explanation of this shift and these omissions is\nmerely speculative, here it seems that Hume does not change his mind\nabout the arguments of the Treatise but chooses to lead the\nreader to the same conclusions by more subtle and indirect means while\navoiding provocative claims.\n\n\nIn the moral Enquiry Hume is more explicit about what he\ntakes to be the errors of Christian (or, more cautiously, Roman\nCatholic) moralists. Not only have they elevated craven humility to\nthe status of a virtue, which he hints in the Treatise is a\nmistake, but they also favor penance, fasting, and other\n\u201cmonkish virtues\u201d that are in fact disapproved by all\nreasonable folk for their uselessness and disagreeableness, and so are\nin fact vices.\n",
