    "main_text": "The Stoics || Syntax and Semantics of Complex Propositions\n5.2 Syntax and Semantics of Complex Propositions\n\n\nThus the Stoics concerned themselves with several issues we would\nplace under the heading of predicate logic; but their main achievement\nwas the development of a propositional logic, i.e. of a system of\ndeduction in which the smallest substantial unanalyzed expressions are\npropositions, or rather, assertibles.\n\n\nThe Stoics defined negations as assertibles that consist of a negative\nparticle and an assertible controlled by this particle (S. E.\nM8.103). Similarly, non-simple assertibles were defined as\nassertibles that either consist of more than one assertible or of one\nassertible taken more than once (D. L. 7.68\u20139) and that are\ncontrolled by a connective particle. Both definitions can be\nunderstood as being recursive and allow for assertibles of\nindeterminate complexity. Three types of non-simple assertibles\nfeature in Stoic syllogistic. Conjunctions are non-simple assertibles\nput together by the conjunctive connective \u2018both \u2026 and\n\u2026\u2019. They have two\n conjuncts.[3]\n Disjunctions are non-simple assertibles put together by the\ndisjunctive connective \u2018either \u2026 or \u2026 or\n\u2026\u2019. They have two or more disjuncts, all on a\npar. Conditionals are non-simple assertibles formed with the\nconnective \u2018if \u2026, \u2026\u2019; they consist of\nantecedent and consequent (D. L. 7.71\u20132). What type of assertible\nan assertible is, is determined by the connective or logical particle\nthat controls it, i.e. that has the largest scope. \u2018Both not\np and q\u2019 is a conjunction, \u2018Not both\np and q\u2019 a negation. Stoic language\nregimentation asks that sentences expressing assertibles always start\nwith the logical particle or expression characteristic for the\nassertible. Thus, the Stoics invented an implicit bracketing device\nsimilar to that used in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019 Polish notation.\n\n\nStoic negations and conjunctions are truth-functional. Stoic (or at\nleast Chrysippean) conditionals are true when the contradictory of the\nconsequent is incompatible with its antecedent (D. L. 7.73). Two\nassertibles are contradictories of each other if one is the negation\nof the other (D. L. 7.73); that is, when one exceeds the other by\na\u2014pre-fixed\u2014negation particle (S. E. M 8.89). The\ntruth-functional Philonian conditional was expressed as a negation of\na conjunction: that is, not as \u2018if p, q\u2019\nbut as \u2018not both p and not q\u2019. Stoic\ndisjunction is exclusive and non-truth-functional. It is true when\nnecessarily precisely one of its disjuncts is true. Later Stoics\nintroduced a non-truth-functional inclusive disjunction (Aulus\nGellius, N. A. 16.8.13\u201314).\n\n\nLike Philo and Diodorus, Chrysippus distinguished four modalities and\nconsidered them modal values of propositions rather than modal\noperators; they satisfy the same standard requirements of modal logic.\nChrysippus\u2019 definitions are (D. L. 7.75): An assertible is possible\nwhen it is both capable of being true and not hindered by external\nthings from being true. An assertible is impossible when it is\n[either] not capable of being true [or is capable of being\ntrue, but hindered by external things from being true]. An\nassertible is necessary when, being true, it either is not capable of\nbeing false or is capable of being false, but hindered by external\nthings from being false. An assertible is non-necessary when it is\nboth capable of being false and not hindered by external things\n[from being false]. Chrysippus\u2019 modal notions differ from\nDiodorus\u2019 in that they allow for future contingents and from Philo\u2019s\nin that they go beyond mere conceptual possibility.\n",
