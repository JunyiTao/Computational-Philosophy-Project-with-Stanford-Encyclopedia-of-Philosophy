    "main_text": "\n\nWord meaning has played a somewhat marginal role in early contemporary\nphilosophy of language, which was primarily concerned with the\nstructural features of sentence meaning and showed less interest in\nthe nature of the word-level input to compositional processes.\nNowadays, it is well-established that the study of word meaning is\ncrucial to the inquiry into the fundamental properties of human\nlanguage. This entry provides an overview of the way issues related to\nword meaning have been explored in analytic philosophy and a summary\nof relevant research on the subject in neighboring scientific domains.\nThough the main focus will be on philosophical problems, contributions\nfrom linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence\nwill also be considered, since research on word meaning is highly\ninterdisciplinary.\n",
