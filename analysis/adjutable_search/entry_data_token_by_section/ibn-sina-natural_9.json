    "main_text": "Motion || Motion as First Actuality\n3.1 Motion as First Actuality\n\nIn Physics, 3.1, Aristotle defines motion (Gk.\nkin\u0113sis, Ar. \u1e25araka) as the\nentelecheia of potential as potential. Aristotle himself\napparently coined the term entelecheia, which might mean\neither \u201cactualization,\u201d as in a process, or\n\u201cactuality,\u201d as in the completion of a process. Given the\nambiguity of this term, it was a matter of some concern among later\nGreek commentators to understand Aristotle\u2019s precise meaning.\nThe details of the Greek debate need not concern us unduly, since the\nissue for philosophers in the medieval Islamic world was all but\nsettled by the choice of the Arabic translator of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics, who rendered entelecheia as\n\u201cperfection\u201d or \u201ccompletion\u201d\n(kam\u0101l). Consequently, for philosophers such as\nAvicenna, motion was understood as a sort of actuality or perfection,\nas opposed to an actualization or a process.\n\nGreek commentators provided additional glosses on the term\nentelecheia, which proved significant in Avicenna\u2019s own\naccount of motion. Drawing upon other Aristotelian texts (e.g., De\nanima, 2.5), these commentators identified both a first actuality\nand second actuality. A first actuality is like the student who\nactually knows a particular language but is not speaking it at that\nmoment, whereas the second actuality is like that student when\nactually speaking that language. Avicenna follows suit and formally\ndefines motion as \u201ca first perfection of what is in potential\ninsofar as it is in potential\u201d (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [3]). To\nclarify, Avicenna notes that in every category there are those things\nthat are actual and other things that, while actual in one respect,\nare potential in another. In the case of motion with respect to\nx (where x is some possible location or quantitative\nor qualitative feature of a body), the body before the motion is in\npotentiality to x\u2014as well as any number of other places\nor states, y, z, etc. After the motion, the body is\nin a state of second actuality with respect to x, that is,\nx has been fully and completely reached or actualized. During\nthe motion, then, the body is in a state of first actuality with\nrespect to x. Avicenna understands this first actuality as a\ntype of \u201cbeing directed toward\u201d x\n(mutawajjih) as opposed to being directed toward y\nor z. There is motion as long as the body is directed toward\nx and there still remains some potentiality with respect to\nx, that is, the place or state of x has not been\nfully reached or actualized. For example, as long as I sit in my home,\nthere are any number of places that I might visit; however, once I get\nup and begin going to the pub, as long as I remain directed toward the\npub but have not yet reached it, there is the motion that is my\nwalking to the pub.\n",
