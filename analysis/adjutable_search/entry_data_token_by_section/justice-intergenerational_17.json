    "main_text": "The Significance of Past Wrongdoing || Superseding Historical Injustices\n5.3 Superseding Historical Injustices\n\nWe now turn to a second source of doubts about the validity of\nhistorical claims to reparations. Injustices committed against people\nin the past may not give rise to claims to reparations today if such\nclaims can be understood to presuppose an indefensible interpretation\nof property entitlements. Jeremy Waldron (Waldron 1992a; Waldron\n1992b: 27; Waldron 2002, 2003, 2004a; Waldron 2004b: 37; Waldron\n2006a, 2006b, 2007; Quist & Veraart 2009; see also Lyons 1977)\nargues that the view that once we acquire entitlements they continue\nuntil we transfer or relinquish them is indefensible since there are\nreasons of principle (not only pragmatic reasons for, e.g., the\nstatutes of limitations and the doctrine of adverse possession (see\nMarmor 2004: 326\u2013329)) for holding that entitlements and rights\nare sensitive to changes of circumstances that typically occur in\ntime. So-called \u201csupersession\u201d of claims owing to past\ninjustices arguably might concern different types of claims and occur\nthrough changes in several types of circumstances, which have\nconsequences for the (1) distributions of goods, (2) connections to\nspecific objects, (3) group identity, and for (4) sovereignty (Meyer\n& Waligore 2018).\n\nWaldron put forward the supersession thesis with respect to indigenous\npeoples in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and others\nhave discussed the idea in this context (Patton 2005; Sanderson 2011;\nSpinner-Halev 2012; Waligore 2016, 2017, 2018). The supersession\nthesis has also been discussed in the context of Israel/Palestine\n(Meisels 2003, 2009: ch. 2; Meyer 2004b; Gans 2008: ch. 4), Fiji\n(Carens 2000: ch. 9), and Pacific Island nations threatened by climate\nchange (Nine 2010). The supersession thesis has become influential\namong theorists both skeptical and supportive of reparations for past\ninjustice (see, for example, Kymlicka 1995: 220; Thompson 2002; R.\nHill 2002; Wenar 2006; Nine 2008;; Waligore 2009; Marmor 2004; Hendrix\n2005; Kolers 2009: ch. 3; Butt 2009: 145\u201348).\n\nAccording to Waldron, entitlement to land is based upon the idea that\nsuch entitlement can be an integral part of people\u2019s life plans\nand projects as individuals and as members of groups. Entitlements to\nland can be important for people being able to autonomously realize\nparticular goods of their way of life. When circumstances change the\nentitlement might no longer be important in that sense or decrease in\nits normative significance. For example, the entitlement of original\nowners might weaken over time if they are separated from the land.\nHaving been separated from the land, entitlement to the land might no\nlonger be important for the original owners autonomously realizing\ntheir way of life. Thus, generally speaking, entitlements are\nsensitive to background circumstances and they are vulnerable to\nprescription. As Waldron argues, property entitlement is a set of\nclaim rights, liberty rights and powers that are\n\u201ccircumstantially sensitive\u201d (Waldron 1992b: 23; see also\nLyons 1977 [1981: 370]).\n\nFurther, if legitimate entitlement is sensitive to background changes,\nit is possible that the ongoing effect of an illegitimate acquisition\nand, more generally, of unjust violations of rights of others can\nbecome legitimate when circumstances change. Waldron\u2019s primary\nexample of supersession concerns \u201cdistributive\nconsiderations\u201d. Waldron says that any plausible theory of\nproperty must be \u201ccircumstantially sensitive\u201d and\ntherefore must allow for the \u201cpossibility\u201d of supersession\n(Waldron 1992b: 25; Waldron 2004a: 67\u201371). He gives an example\nin which the violation by one group of the legitimate rights of\nanother group to a given waterhole is superseded by ecological\ncatastrophe such that the interlopers acquire a right to share what\nthey had wrongly begun to use. In these circumstances, \n\n\nthey are entitled to share that water hole. Their use of [the\nwaterhole] no longer counts as an injustice; it is now in fact part of\nwhat justice now requires. The initial injustice by [the first group]\nagainst [the second] has been superseded by circumstances. (Waldron\n2004a: 67) \n\n\nHence justice may require that original owners of land share their\nland with others and they may be required to share even with those who\nunjustly appropriated the land.\n\nEven in cases of so-called ancient historical injustice one might have\ndoubts that the conditions for supersession are fully met (Patton\n2004: 167\u2013171) (so that no historical claims continue to be\nvalid). With respect to more recent injustices the conditions for\ntheir supersession will often not be met (see Lyons 2004a: 296; Meyer\n2007: 301\u2013305). One might also doubt that supersession is to be\nunderstood as final. In order to account for the complexities of the\nreal world cases of historical injustice and their consequences it\nmight be helpful to distinguish between \u201cpartial\nsupersession\u201d and \u201cfull supersession\u201d (Meyer &\nWaligore 2018: 227\u2013228) and between \u201cfinal\nsupersession\u201d and \u201cdormant supersession\u201d (Meyer\n& Waligore 2018:\n 228\u2013229).[19]\n",
