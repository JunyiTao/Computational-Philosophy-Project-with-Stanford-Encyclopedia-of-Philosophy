    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nAdam Wodeham [Goddam/Woodham] (c. 1295\u20131358) was born near\nSouthampton. He entered the Franciscan order at a young age.\nWodeham\u2019s earliest philosophical education was at the Franciscan\nstudium in London where he first studied under Walter Chatton\n(c. 1317\u20131321) and then William of Ockham (1320\u20131324).\nDuring this period of intense study, Wodeham collaborated with Ockham\non his massive Summa logicae, editing it and preparing it for\npublication. After Ockham departed for Avignon in the summer of 1324,\nWodeham was sent to Oxford to complete his studies. At Oxford he\nattended the sentential lectures of Richard FitzRalph\n(1328\u20131329), and subsequently qualified to read the\nSentences.\n\nWodeham lectured on the Sentences of Peter Lombard at the\nLondon convent sometime in the 1320s, although his earliest lecture\nnotes have not survived. He later lectured at the provincial school in\nNorwich sometime in the late 1320s, a work that is now referred to as\nthe Lectura secunda [LS]. Finally, Wodeham delivered the\nOxford lectures (referred to as the Ordinatio Oxoniensis\n[OO]) between 1332 and 1334 (Streveler and Tachau 1995, 22\u201323,\nn. 61). According to Thomas de Eccleston (Eccleston 1951, 57), Wodeham\nwas the 61st lector at Oxford, Greyfriars. As is the case\nwith many medieval philosophers, little is known about his latter life\nafter he completed is education. He apparently traveled to Basel in\n1339, survived the plague in 1348\u201349, and died at the Franciscan\nconvent at Babwell in 1358 (Courtenay 1978, 181).\n2. Writings\n\nThe extant writings of Adam Wodeham include: his two commentaries on\nthe Sentences of Peter Lombard (the Lectura and the\nOrdinatio); a prologue to William of Ockham\u2019s Summa\nlogicae; a short quaestio on the continuum; a\nlonger Tractatus de indivisibilibus; the Tractatus\nalphabeticus, and perhaps the 51st chapter of part I\nof Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae and the last question of book\nIV of the same author\u2019s Reportatio.\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s most significant philosophical and theological\nworks are his two commentaries on the Sentences. The\nLectura (c. 1320s) is the earlier of the two works and is a\nloose commentary on the first 26 distinctions of the first book of the\nLombard\u2019s Sentences. The single manuscript of the\nLectura (Cambridge, Gonville and Caius, Ms 281 (674), ff.\n105\u2013250) has been published in a modern critical edition\n(G\u00e1l and Wood 1990). The Ordinatio (1332\u201334),\nWodeham\u2019s most mature extant work, is a more expansive\ncommentary, treating all four books of the Lombard\u2019s\nSentences and extensively re-writing and re-organizing the\nfirst 26 distinctions of the first book. A critical edition of the\nOrdinatio is available at the\n Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive.\n\nThe shorter works of Wodeham comprise several collaborations with his\nteacher William of Ockham. These include Wodeham\u2019s brief\nintroduction to Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae, which has been\nedited in the critical edition. Further, Courtenay argues that Wodeham\nis probably the disciple who wrote the 51st chapter of part\nI of Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae (Courtenay 1978, 34). Both\nof these short works were written between 1320 and 1324, as Wodeham\ncollaborated with the Venerable Inceptor. Finally, Gedeon G\u00e1l\nalso noted that in one of the manuscripts of Ockham\u2019s\nReportatio (Milan, Ambros. 281 inf., fol. 69rb) on\nbook IV of the Sentences, a marginal notation attributes the\nfinal question of the work to Wodeham (Courtenay 1978, 34, fn.\n61).\n\nWodeham\u2019s shorter works also include two tracts on the\ncontinuum written against the indivisibilists or atomists and\nthe Tractatus alphabeticus. The shorter work on the\ncontinuum (Murdoch and Synan 1966, 212\u2013288), consisting\nof a single quaestio, is an early redaction of the longer\nwork, the Tractatus de indivisibilibus (Wood 1988). Both of\nthe works were probably written between 1323 and 1331 (Wood 1998, 16).\nThe Tractatus alphabeticus considers the latitude of forms\nand was written around 1333 (Wood 374).\n\nFinally, the lost works of Adam Wodeham include Biblical commentaries\non the Canticum canticorum and the first book of\nEcclesiasticus. And, based on historical and textual\nevidence, it is generally held that Wodeham wrote a set of\nDeterminationes, some of which were probably included in the\nTractatus de indivisibilibus.\n3. Position in the History of Philosophy\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s place in the history of philosophy remains\ndifficult to appreciate because of two related problems, here referred\nto as: (1) the historiographical problem; and (2) the textual problem.\nHistoriographically, the field of medieval philosophy has been plagued\nby various narrative accounts of the twelfth through fifteenth\ncenturies that characterize the period in which Wodeham flourished as\nan age in which fideism, skepticism and scholastic decadence ruled the\nday (Inglis, 1998). This basic historiographical approach to the late\nmedieval period has recently come under serious attack and scrutiny by\nspecialists working in the field, but a balanced picture of the\nphilosophers and theologians working during this period remains in its\ninfancy. Second, an accurate understanding of Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nplace within the history of philosophy is handicapped by the lack of\ncritical editions for Adam Wodeham, his immediate contemporaries, and\nnumerous medieval philosophers and theologians working in the late\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Regarding Wodeham, it is important\nto recognize that a critical edition of any complete text of Wodeham\nwas not available until recently (Wood 1988; G\u00e1l and Wood\n1990). Further, as already noted, an edition of Wodeham\u2019s most\nmature and complete work, the Ordinatio, is only now\nunderway. As such, the place of Adam Wodeham within the history of\nmedieval thought is difficult to trace at present, and William\nCourtenay\u2019s important study remains the most relevant point of\nreference (Courtenay, 1978).\n\nBased on the work of Courtenay, the first references to\nWodeham\u2019s place within medieval thought must begin by\nconsidering his socii (or contemporary\nsententiarii). Wodeham lectured on the Sentences at\nOxford in 1332\u20131334, and contemporaneous with his lectures there\nwere other bachelors lecturing on the Sentences\n(baccalarius sententiarius) in the various other convents or\ntheological schools (Courtenay 1978, 89). Understanding who these\nbachelors are is important because they often engaged with each\nother\u2019s work. In the case of Adam Wodeham the list of\nsocii includes: Monachus Niger (Benedictine), Robert Holcot\nOP, William Crathorn OP, Roger Gosford OP, Edmund Grafton OFM, Hugh\nGrafton OESA, William Chiterne OFM, William Skelton: Mertonian,\nRichard of Radford, and an unnamed Carmelite (Courtenay 1978,\n89\u2013111).\n\nBeyond his immediate socii, Wodeham\u2019s influence between\n1334 and 1346 is evident in England, Paris and Cologne. English\ntheologians, between 1334 and 1350, often do not cite contemporaries\nby name. That said, there is substantial evidence that Wodeham\u2019s\ncontemporaries took his thought seriously. During these decades,\nCourtenay lists the following English theologians as making either\nimplicit or explicit reference to Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nlecturae: Thomas Bradwardine (Mertonian), Robert of Halifax\nOFM, Roger Roseth OFM and Thomas Buckingham (Mertonian) (Courtenay\n1978, 116\u2013123). In contrast to the English authors discussed\nabove, the Parisian authors between 1342 and 1345 were much more\nwilling to cite a contemporary author (Courtenay 1978, 123). Thus, in\nthis period almost all of the Parisian theologians commenting on the\nSentences cite Wodeham: Gregory of Rimini OESA, Alphonsus\nVargas OESA and John of Mirecourt (Cistercian). These authors exhibit\na strong knowledge of Wodeham and all had some access to the Oxford\n(Ordinatio) redaction of Wodeham\u2019s work (Courtenay\n1978, 132). In particular one should note Gregory of Rimini\u2019s\nextensive knowledge of the thought of Wodeham. The spread of\nOckham\u2019s philosophical and theological thought into Germany\n(both directly and indirectly through the study of Wodeham) took place\nbetween 1335 and 1350 and is evident in Cologne. This is perhaps due\nto the fact that Wodeham traveled to Basel in the summer of 1339\nbringing with him a copy of his Ordinatio (Courtenay 1978,\n133 and 181). How long Wodeham remained in Germany, or where he\ntraveled, remains unknown. But, it is significant that in Cologne,\nsometime before 1348, one theologian lectured on the Sentences\nsecundum Adam (Courtenay 1978, 133). This and other evidence\nsuggest that Wodeham was being studied seriously in Cologne before\n1348.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Parisian condemnations of Nicholas of\nAutrecourt in 1346 and John of Mirecourt in 1347, one may expect that\nthe influence of Wodeham would have waned in subsequent years. But,\nCourtenay argues that the citations of Wodeham throughout this\nturbulent period demonstrate that this was not the case (Courtenay\n1978, 135). Evidence of Parisian masters engaging the thought of\nWodeham in the years after 1347 is evident in the works of: Peter\nCeffons O.Cist. and Hugolino Malabrancha of Oriveto OESA.\n\nIn the final four decades of the fourteenth century there is an\nincrease in the citations of the moderni as evidenced in the\nextant commentaries. The list of commentaries that cite Wodeham\nincludes: the anonymous author of ms. Vat. Lat. 986, John Hiltalingen\nof Basel OESA, James of Eltville O.Cist, Conrad of Ebrach O.Cist.,\nPierre d\u2019Ailly, Henry Totting of Oyta, John of Wasia, Henry of\nLangenstein, Nicholas of Dinkelsb\u00fchl, Peter of Candia, John\nBrammart O.C., Peter Plaoul, and Marsilius of Inghen. This period of\nmedieval philosophy remains understudied, but it is clear that there\nwas a strong interest in Wodeham at the close of the fourteenth\ncentury. Further evidence of this is found in Henry Totting of\nOyta\u2019s Abbreviato of Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nOrdinatio produced between 1373 and 1378 (Courtenay 1978,\n147). Oyta\u2019s Abbreviato of Wodeham was influential in\nthe fifteenth century, as is clear from the number of extant\nmanuscripts spread throughout Europe.\n\nThe influence of Wodeham\u2019s thought in the fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries is a chapter of medieval philosophy and theology\nthat has yet to be written. There are citations of Wodeham in the\nworks of Arnold of Sehnsen O.C., Peter Reicher/Pirchenward, John\nCapreolus, Gabriel Biel and John Mair (Major), although the evidence\nat this point has yet to be analyzed in detail (Courtenay 1978,\n150\u2013156). What is certain is that Wodeham remained important for\nphilosophers and theologians in the long fifteenth century, and John\nMair eventually, in the sixteenth century, published an edition of\nOyta\u2019s Abbreviato. This has been both positive and\nnegative for Wodeham studies: positive, as Wodeham has remained\navailable to those who do not have access to the manuscript tradition;\nand negative as it has meant that scholars often read and cite an\ninferior text that significantly abbreviates the original work. More\nattention should be given to the influence of Wodeham in this\nperiod.\n\n4. Psychology and Cognition\n\nTo the present day a significant part of Wodeham scholarship has been\nfocused on his philosophy of mind and the sequence of events from\nsense impression to complex scientific judgment. Modern\nscholarship\u2019s focus here is partly due to the fact that this was\na clear area of interest for Wodeham, to which he devoted significant\nenergy. But it is also a reflection of the availability of texts; the\ncontracted nature of the Lectura secunda has focused the\nefforts of scholarship on book I and issues of cognition. In the\nfollowing section, we will try to give an overview of the general\nconsensus and debates of modern scholarship on the process of\ncognition as it is currently found in the Lectura\nsecunda.\n4.1 Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition\n\nWodeham turns first to the question of intuitive and abstractive\ncognition: two concepts developed by John Duns Scotus and William of\nOckham. But while they identify the parallel notions of intuitive and\nabstractive cognition proper to the sensitive and intellective souls\nrespectively, Wodeham distinguishes himself from his predecessors by\ninsisting that this parallel reduplication is redundant and violates\nthe principle of parsimony.\n\nRegarding intuitive cognition Wodeham begins by stating that:\n\u201cevery act of science naturally caused presupposes evidence of\nsome proposition or of the thing signified through the proposition.\nScience (or a scientific act of assent) is caused by the mediation of\nthis evidence\u201d (LS I:9, ll. 44\u201346).\n\nThe question is: what is the source of this evidence? The assumption\nis that an evident proposition arises from, or is formulated from,\ncertain types of simple evident apprehensions, namely, intuitive\napprehensions. Wodeham, then asks: does the intellect require an\nintuitive apprehension distinct from the act of sensation?\n\nThe definition of intuitive apprehension states that such an\napprehension must be sufficient for the intellect to make a judgment\nabout the existence of the object. Given this definition Wodeham\nwonders why a second act of intuitive apprehension, beyond the\napprehension of sensation, is necessary in order for the intellect to\nmake this judgment. The fact that the present object in question has\nbeen \u201csensed\u201d ought to be sufficient for the intellect to\nfeel confident that such an object exists.\n\nWodeham\u2019s position is distinctive because he denies what was a\ntraditional distinction for Scotus and Ockham, namely, a distinction\nbetween the sensitive and intellective soul (a real distinction in the\ncase of Ockham and a formal distinction in the case of Scotus). For\nWodeham, the assumption of two separate acts of intuition mandates\nthat a human being have either two souls or that the human has one\nsoul and also another vital power, separate from that soul. But,\ndrawing on the authority of Augustine, Wodeham identifies the notion\nof two souls as a heresy to be avoided. Another option is to think\nthat the sensitive soul is not really a soul at all, but rather a\npower distinct and separate from the one human soul. But this too is\nunacceptable. To be a true sensitive potency, Wodeham insists that it\nmust be a living form (viva forma); if it were not, it would\nnot be able to receive \u201cliving\u201d or vital acts, among which\napprehensive and appetitive acts are numbered. But if one admits that\nthe sensitive power remains a \u201cliving form\u201d, then two\nsouls are once more introduced into the single human being. This, at\nleast, is the case for Wodeham, who holds that to be a\n\u201csoul\u201d is to be a \u201cliving form\u201d (LS I:11, ll.\n44\u201355). Thus, Wodeham is adamant that there can only be one soul\nin the single human being, and the intuitive act of sensation alone is\nsufficient for the simple apprehension \u201cpresupposed\u201d by an\n\u201cevident assent\u201d (LS I:9, ll. 44\u201348). However, by\ndenying this distinction, Wodeham must be willing to say that,\nstrictly speaking, the \u201cintellect senses\u201d because it is\nthe same intellectual soul that both senses and thinks. This was an\nunsavory consequence for a thinker like Ockham, but one that Wodeham\nwas fully willing to accept (Wood 1990, 21*; LS I:14\u201315,\nll.1\u201349).\n\nDespite disagreeing with Scotus and Ockham on the nature of the\nintellective and the sensitive soul, Wodeham affirms the formal\ndefinition of intuition originally given by Scotus. This definition is\nformulated in the third conclusion of the second question of the\nprologue to the Lectura Secunda: \u201cthe incomplex act,\nwhich is able to cause evident assent about a contingent truth of a\npresent object, and which naturally requires the existence and\npresence of that object, is intuitive knowledge\u201d (LS I, 37, ll.\n69\u201372). The presence of the object is required and not just its\nexistence because intuitive cognition requires the object to function\nas an efficient cause. The object, however, cannot function as an\nefficient cause unless it is also present to the knower (LS\nI:45\u201346, ll. 40\u201344).\n\nWith this definition Wodeham is also rejecting an important and\ncontroversial part of Ockham\u2019s definition of intuitive\nknowledge. For Ockham, not only was an intuitive knowledge able to\nproduce an affirmative judgment of the existence of an extant object,\nbut it was also able to affirm the non-existence of a non-extant\nobject. By insisting on the criteria of a present object for any kind\nof intuitive knowledge, Wodeham denies that an intuition of a\nnon-extant, non-present object is possible. Here Wodeham offers an\nillustrative example. He remarks that sometimes we can judge that\nsomething does not exist as a consequence of having a positive\nintuition. He gives the example of intuitively seeing the dead body of\nSocrates and knowing that Socrates does not exist. While\nacknowledging that such an example might be the inspiration behind\nOckham\u2019s controversial claim about an intuitive knowledge of\nnon-existents, he points out that in this example, we do not have an\nintuitive knowledge of the same thing about which we are making a\njudgment. Rather we are making an inference from our intuitive\nknowledge of (and a judgment about) the existence of the dead body of\nSocrates (LS I:38\u201339, ll. 4\u201315).\n\nThe difference, then, between intuitive knowledge and abstractive\nknowledge is again taken from Scotus. Here, in Wodeham\u2019s sixth\nconclusion, of the second question, the difference is attributable,\nnot to diverse objects of knowledge, but to the attitude that one can\ntake towards that object with respect to existence (LS I:45, ll.\n22\u201326). Unlike intuitive knowledge, abstractive knowledge does\nnot require the existence or presence of the object to be known.\nHowever, in this case \u201cwhat is known\u201d is indifferent to\nthe existence of that object and no judgment about that object\u2019s\nexistence can be made.\n4.2 Skepticism and Aureoli\n\nWodeham\u2019s decision to identify the difference between intuitive\nand abstractive knowledge with the presence or absence of an object,\nas Scotus and Ockham did, meant that he shared with these two thinkers\na common opponent, namely Peter Aureoli. In response to Scotus\u2019s\ndefinition of intuitive knowledge Aureoli identified several\nexperiences wherein a person appears to have a sensitive intuition of\na non-present object. Such experiences, according to Aureoli, were the\nconsequence of lingering sensitive images that remain even after an\nobject is no longer present. Such lingering images (sometimes called\nesse perspectivum or esse apparens) were used to\nexplain all sorts of visual anomalies that do not correspond to\nreality. Such experiences were enough for Aureoli to define intuitive\nknowledge, not as the direct grasp of a present object, but as\ndirect knowledge (as opposed to knowledge arrived at through\na discursive reasoning process). Rega Wood explains:\n\n\nAbstract and intuitive cognition were distinguished by the manner in\nwhich their objects were presented. The objects of abstract cognition\nappeared in a quasi-imaginary mode (quasi modo imaginario et\nabsente); intuitive cognition was direct rather than discursive,\nand it conveyed the impression that its objects existed and were\nactually present (Wood 1982, 216).\n\n\nIn short, this meant that a direct grasp of a lingering appearance or\nesse apparens, even after the object was no longer present,\ncould count as intuitive knowledge.\n\nFor those who came after Aureoli, his definition and his notion of\nesse apparens raised a host of skeptical concerns. If\nsensation produces an esse apparens, the intellect must also\nproduce a similar object, something Peter Aureoli called esse\nintentionale. And if intuitive knowledge is a direct knowledge of\neither the esse apparens or the esse intentionale,\nand not of the object itself, from where does the certainty come by\nwhich one can firmly and confidently state that \u201cthis thing\nexists\u201d? Aureoli\u2019s esse apparens opened up the\npossibility of an experience, wherein what appears to be present,\nmight actually not be present or even in existence.\n\nOckham\u2019s answer to Aureoli\u2019s insistence on the need for an\nesse apparens to explain certain strange and misleading\nphenomena was to relocate the source of the error. The error does not\ncome from the impression of some non-existent object. On the contrary,\nthe naturally produced intuitive cognition does not lie. Instead, as\nWood paraphrases Ockham, \u201cerror arises when the observer infers\na proposition which does not follow formally from his\nperceptions\u201d (Wood 1982, 224). Ockham calls the intuition of\nthose appearances that cause apparitions \u201cimperfect intuitive\ncognition\u201d. In such cases, the immediate judgment of the\nintellect is not \u201cthat the object represented exists\u201d, but\n\u201cthat the object was impressed\u201d (and, it would seem, that\nthis impression exists). The intellect errs, then, when it assents to\nwhat the \u201cimperfect\u201d intuition does not warrant.\n\nA central concern with Ockham\u2019s account, raised by Walter\nChatton and responded to by Wodeham, was the character of these\napparition causing \u201cafter-images\u201d. For Ockham, the after\nimages were not caused by the object, but by a lingering impression\ndistinct from the object or impression-causing species. For Chatton,\nit could not be overlooked that these after-images appeared as\nif they were the object, not as if they were some\nleft-over impression caused by the object. Thus, he argued that the\nafter-images are caused by the lingering of the representative species\nof the object, even after the object is no longer present. Chatton was\ntherefore willing to admit that intuition of a non-present object was\npossible, as long as its representative species lingered.\n\nOn this issue Wodeham takes sides with Ockham against Chatton. He\nexpressly attacks Chatton\u2019s description of the lingering species\nas having a likeness sufficient to cause the observer to believe in\nthe existence of the original object. Wood writes of Wodeham\u2019s\nposition:\n\n\nIn after-images only the remains of the form or species caused by the\nfirst act of perception are seen. But the belief that the principal\nobject is seen when after-images are present is not caused by the\nfirst vision or even by the remains of the species imprinted during\nvision. It is caused by strong imagination which leads the observer to\njudge falsely that what he sees in an after-image is the same as what\nhe saw when the principal object was presented (Wood 1982, 228).\n\n\nIn short, against Chatton, Wodeham defends an Ockham-like position,\nsuggesting that the source of error is not the intuitive cognition of\nsomething not actually there, but the fact that the intellect chooses\nto make a judgment about the existence of something other than what\nwas intuited. In many ways, the case is similar to that inference made\nabout Socrates\u2019 non-existence, when Socrates\u2019 dead body is\nintuitively grasped. The inference made from one intuitive cognition\nis not always correct, even if the intuition itself remains\nreliable.\n4.3 Three Degrees of Evidence\n\nWhat then does all this mean for the question of certitude and the\npossibility of building a genuine and trustworthy science based on\nthese foundational impressions received from the natural world?\nWodeham defended the reliability of our immediate simple\napprehensions, but he also admitted the possibility that the\nimagination can severely distort these impressions such that we are\ninclined to assent to what the simple apprehension itself does not\nwarrant.\n\nWodeham discusses the question of evidence for a proposition which can\nbe built from these initial apprehensions in the sixth question of the\nprologue. He says that the idea of \u201ccomplex evidence\u201d can\nbe understood in two ways: either as referring to the apprehension of\nan evident proposition itself or to the so-called \u201cevident\njudgment\u201d which has been caused by this evident proposition.\n\nWhat Wodeham means by an evident proposition is complicated and\nrequires that we have a clear sense of the distinction between\napprehension and judgment, which are for Wodeham two distinct and\nseparate acts. An evident proposition for Wodeham can be of three\nkinds. The first and lowest degree of evidence is identified with the\napprehension of the proposition (or what it signifies). Wodeham uses\nas his example the proposition, \u201ca stick submerged in water is\nbroken\u201d. The apprehension of this state of affairs has all the\ntrappings of an evident proposition, to such an extent that it\ninclines us to perform the separate act of producing an affirmative\njudgment. Nevertheless, this type of proposition is one that can still\nbe false, despite the fact that it has all the appearance of truth.\nThis lingering possibility, however, allows the intellect to suspend\nits judgment on the basis of other experiences or reasons. Distinctive\nof such propositions is their contingent nature. Though they can\nappear true, it remains possible that they are false.\n\nThe second degree of certainty associated with evident propositions is\nexemplified by a proposition that not only appears certain and\ninclines the judgment to assent, but is also a proposition that cannot\nfail to signify correctly. According to Wodeham all propositions of\nthis type are categorical and necessary. And, he distinguishes them\nfrom those contingent types of propositions which may have every\nappearance of being true but yet may turn out to be false (LS II:163,\nll.17\u201320).\n\nFinally, Wodeham distinguishes this second type of evident proposition\nfrom a third type of proposition which is also categorical and\nnecessary. This third type of proposition is the highest degree of\nevidence, because, not only can it not fail to appear and be\ntrue, but it also cannot be doubted. That is, it not only inclines to\nassent, but necessitates the intellect to assent. For Wodeham, this is\ndistinct from the second and less-evident type of proposition. While\nthis second type cannot fail to be true, it nevertheless can still be\ndoubted owing to the fact that other conflicting propositions also\nappear to be true. The third type cannot be doubted in this way, no\nmatter what other propositions appear to be true. If other evident\npropositions are genuinely in conflict with (i.e., are inconsistent\nwith) the proposition in question, those propositions cannot be\nevident in the highest degree. But nor can these conflicting\npropositions be evident in the second highest degree since the second\nand third types are both supposed to be necessary. Therefore they\ncannot actually be in conflict, though it is still possible that they\nmay appear to be in conflict. For Wodeham, propositions of the third\nand highest type can be known in themselves and are necessarily\nper se nota (LS I:164, 36).\n4.4 Evident Judgments\n\nIf this is how we can understand an evident proposition, what then\nconstitutes an evident judgment? Again, a judgment, for Wodeham, is\nsharply distinguished from the distinct act of apprehension or the\nmental proposition. It amounts to a mental nod of approval to the\ncorrespondence between the apprehended proposition and the reality\nsignified. (See LS I, prol., d. 6, \u00a7\u00a020, I:176\u2013178.)\nClearly, the first two types of propositions do not provide us with\nabsolute certainty. These propositions have all the appearance of\ntruth, but the judgment that follows from them cannot be called\nevident as long as doubt remains, even if the judgment in question is\ncorrect.\n\nWhen it comes then to a truly evident judgment, propositions which are\nper se nota can cause evident judgments because the truth of\nthose propositions can in no way be doubted. However, besides\npropositions per se nota there are certain mechanisms through\nwhich originally dubitable propositions can come to be evident in the\nthird degree, thereby necessitating assent and causing a truly evident\njudgment.\n\nThe most obvious mechanism is the demonstrative syllogism, which leads\nus finally to Wodeham\u2019s conception of a science and the\nimmediate object of this act of assent. In article two of question\none, he discusses whether a scientific act of knowing (the evident\nassent given to the conclusion of a syllogism) has as its immediate\nobject \u201cthat which is signified by only one proposition, i.e.,\nthe conclusion\u201d or \u201cthat which is signified by the\nconclusion and the premises joined together at the same time through a\nsyllogism\u201d (LS I:199, ll. 5\u201311). Wodeham\u2019s\nconclusion is decidedly in favor of the latter; namely, in order for a\npreviously dubitable proposition to be elevated to the third degree of\nevidence, whereby the intellect is necessitated to assent, it must\nacquire that evidence from the force of the syllogism as whole. The\nconclusion by itself is not per se nota. Thus, for a truly\nevident judgment to take place, a single evident proposition cannot be\nits cause, rather all three propositions of the syllogism must be\ntaken together in order for the concluding proposition to have the\nevidence it needs to not only appear true, but to compel the\nmind\u2019s assent (LS I:199\u2013208). This requirement that\nscientific assent be given to the syllogism as a whole (and cannot be\nsustained if one of the premises is forgotten) is a position that will\nbe explicitly opposed by the later Parisian reader of Wodeham, Gregory\nof Rimini (Lectura, I, Prol., q. 3, a. 1, Trapp I:107ff).\n4.5 The Complexe Significabile\n\nIf there is a topic that has dominated Wodeham scholarship, it is the\ncomplexe significabile or alternatively, that which is\nsignifiable in a complex way, i.e., through a proposition. This\nmysterious entity was intended by Wodeham to function both as the\nimmediate object of propositional knowledge and as a genuine via\nmedia between two extreme theories regarding the object of\nknowledge offered by his contemporaries. Representing one extreme was\nWilliam of Ockham, who was thought by Wodeham to identify the terms of\na proposition as the actual object. This is sometimes referred to as\nthe anti-realist position. On the other hand there was Walter Chatton,\nwho argued that the object of propositional knowledge was the actual\nentity signified by the subject term of the proposition. Wodeham, in\nturn, rejected both these positions and stated that the object of\nscience was an actual state of affairs which could only be signified\nthrough a complex or a proposition. Questions and puzzles have\ncontinued to linger regarding the exact ontological status of these\nstates-of-affairs. While insisting that they have some real\nontological weight, they do not fit nicely under either of the\nAristotelian categories of real being, substance or accident. Thus,\nwithin an Aristotelian framework, it is difficult to articulate\nexactly how or in what way the complexe significabile is\nactually real.\n\nThe legacy of the complexe significabile has a somewhat\ninvolved history. We can find several examples of its use and\ndiscussion throughout the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies. However, for many years the idea was thought to originate\nwith Gregory of Rimini. Modern scholarship slowly discovered, albeit\nnot immediately, that this particular terminology was original to\nWodeham and only later adopted by Rimini. (The idea, however, has many\nprecursors evident in earlier debates over terms like dicta\nor enuntiabilia. See Klima 1993; Nuchelmans 1973; Bermon\n2007.) The most frequently cited misattribution in modern scholarship\nhas been Hubert Elie\u2019s \u201cLe complexe significabile\u201d\n(Elie 1936). In the following generation, Gedeon G\u00e0l\n(G\u00e0l 1977) discovered that Wodeham was actually the author of\nthis idea. G\u00e0l edited the first modern edition of the\nLectura Secunda dist. 1, q. 1, the traditional point of entry\ninto Wodeham\u2019s thought on the matter. Since G\u00e0l\u2019s\narticle, several studies have followed: Nuchelmans (1980), Tachau\n(1987), Grassi (1990), Zupko (1994\u20131997), Karger (1995), and\nBrower-Toland (2007). A frequent part of the contemporary discussion\ninvolves distinguishing the genuine doctrine of Adam Wodeham from\nlater versions. G\u00e0l\u2019s initial characterization of\nRimini\u2019s position as a \u201cmutilation\u201d of\nWodeham\u2019s position has exerted its influence over the subsequent\nscholarship (cf. Nuchelmans, and esp. Zupko). Most complaints stem\nfrom the idea that Rimini gives too much ontological weight to this\nmysterious entity or at least lacks the nuance of Wodeham, exposing\nthe doctrine to objections that could not be addressed to Wodeham\nhimself (cf. Zupko 1994\u20131997). Brower-Toland has recently\nchallenged this traditional reading. She suggests the \u201cradical\nnature of Wodeham\u2019s claims\u201d have largely gone\nunrecognized, and that his complexe significabile represents\na significant \u201contological addition\u201d to the Aristotelian\nsubstance-accident framework (Brower-Toland 2007:600n7,\n638\u2013640).\n5. Philosophical Theology\n5.1 Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n\nWodeham\u2019s approach to philosophical theology begins with a\ntraditional attempt to determine whether or not God\u2019s existence\ncan be philosophically and demonstratively proved.\n\nIn both the Lectura secunda and the Ordinatio his\nstrategy is structured by two proofs. The first is taken from and\nexplicitly attributed to Scotus. Of the Scotist proof, Wodeham remarks\nthat it seems very persuasive and more evident than any reason that\ncan be brought against it. The second argument appears to be original\nto Wodeham.\n\nThe first proof taken from John Duns Scotus is found both in his\nOrdinatio and De Primo Principio. The argument\nfollows from an initial disjunctive premise: there is either some\nfirst uncaused cause or there is not. If the former, Scotus and\nWodeham argue that it is obvious that this is God. If the latter is\nchosen then unacceptable consequences follow. The most notable is that\nthere would be an infinite series of caused causes without a\nterminating point. Two reasons are offered for why such an infinite\nseries is impossible. The first is that, the whole of all\n\u201cessentially ordered\u201d causes must have a cause, but if the\ncause of this multitude comes from the totality of caused causes, then\nthis cause will be the cause of itself, which is impossible. The\nsecond reason that an infinite series of causes will not work is this\nwould require that there are an infinite amount of causes acting at\nthe same time. This requirement is built into Wodeham\u2019s (and\nScotus\u2019s) conception of essentially ordered causes\u2014which\nWodeham later sharply distinguishes from a series of accidentally\nordered causes.\n\nWodeham offers a second proof for the existence of God. Regarding this\nproof he states that it is sufficient to incline the intellect to\nassent, but he also acknowledges that it is still able to be doubted\nby \u201cshameful adversaries\u201d (LS II:121; OO I, d. 2, a. 1).\nAccording to Wodeham\u2019s description of different types of\nevidence, it is clear that this \u201cproof\u201d is not able to\ncompel a truly evident judgment because the proof remains open to\ndoubt and thus only reaches the second degree of evidence.\n\nThe proof begins from another disjunctive proposition inspired by\nAnselm\u2019s Proslogion. Either there is some most noble\nbeing about which no more noble thing is able to be thought, or there\nis no such most noble thing. Wodeham remarks that one possible\nconsequence that might follow is that there would be an infinite\nsuccession of more noble things, thus permitting an infinity of\nbeings. This conclusion, he says, is unpleasant to the mind; that is,\nthe intellect is not able to admit an infinity of beings without\n\u201cgrumbling\u201d (murmere). For this option at least,\nit is clear that the intellect can incline us to assent that God\nexists, but it is still possible to doubt it, which is the\ndistinguishing mark of the second degree of evidence. The other\nalternative is that there must be some most noble thing actually\nexisting (in actu existens), even though this is not the most\nnoble thing possible. Wodeham finds this alternative opposed by the\nmost evident of reasons\u2014something akin to Anselm\u2019s\nontological argument: whatever is actually existing (existens in\nactu) is de facto more noble than what is not in\nexistence. Thus, it is nonsensical to speak of something more noble,\nwhich is only potentially existing (LS II:121, ll.13\u201315).\n5.2 Proof of God\u2019s Unicity\n\nFrom the philosophical proof of the existence of the highest being,\nnot always demonstrative, but evident in at least the second degree,\nWodeham turns to the question of whether there is one highest being or\nmany. The question found in Lectura, I, q. 1, a. 3, and the\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, a. 2 is posed in an ambiguous way. It asks\nwhether it is evidently probable that something absolutely\nuncausable is only one in number. The question is ambiguous because it\nis not immediately clear whether Wodeham\u2019s intention is to show\nthat there is only one God or if he intends to evaluate the relative\ndegrees of evidence of the existing proofs of God\u2019s unicity or\nmultiplicity.\n\nAs the question progresses, it appears that Wodeham is primarily\ninterested in evaluating the evidence of both pro and con arguments.\nWodeham juxtaposes arguments of Scotus against counter arguments of\nOckham in order to argue that the unicity of God cannot be\ndemonstrably proven. Ultimately, he argues that its seems that natural\nreason is not able to prove evidently the numerical unity of God (LS\nII:144). He argues for the inconclusiveness of several arguments\nincluding: the argument that proceeds from the belief that there\ncannot be several total causes of the same effect (LS II:144); that\nthere cannot be more than one necessary being (LS II:159); and that\nthere cannot be more than one final cause (OO I, q. 2, a. 2, dubium\n5). In the end, Wodeham is not interested in denying that there is\nonly one God, but he simply wants to show that the relatively strong\narguments for God\u2019s unicity do not reach the third and highest\ndegree of evidence.\n\nEven when it comes to the specific unity of God, which is granted only\na brief discussion in the Lectura secunda and is left out of\nthe Ordinatio altogether, Wodeham shows some hesitation. He\nwrites: \u201cI say that the argument of Scotus given above is\nprobably able to be persuasive\u201d (LS II: 171). Thus he again\nshows that even though it is his own opinion that God is specifically\none, it is possible for doubt to continue to linger.\n5.3 Philosophy and the Trinity\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s trinitarian theology is developed in the\nLectura (d. 2, d. 3 q. 5; d. 7; dd. 9\u201316; dd.\n18\u201321; dd. 23\u201326) and the Ordinatio I, d. 3; d.\n33 qq. 1\u20139. The two accounts, despite their various formal\nplacements in the two works, are often identical (e.g., LS d. 11, q.\nun. and OO d. 33, q. 6). Wodeham, however, did substantially re-work\nhis discussion of the imago Trinitatis (LS d. 3, q. 5; OO I,\nd. 3), focusing in the latter work on the writings of Richard\nFitzRalph instead of Richard Campsall. Further, in the closing\ndiscussion of distinction 2 of the Ordinatio, Wodeham tells\nhis readers that the discussion of the Trinity will be collected into\nthe numerous questions of distinction 33.\n\nWodeham\u2019s trinitarian theology has received little attention\nfrom scholars. However, there are several notable exceptions. Hester\nGelber offers an analysis of Ordinatio I, dd. 33, qq.\n1\u20133, concerning the formal distinction and formal non-identity\n(q. 1) and the complex problem of trinitarian paralogisms (qq.\n2\u20133) (Gelber 1974, 235\u2013264, 629\u2013648). Russell\nFriedman treats the relationship between Peter Auriol and Adam Wodeham\nin the Lectura secunda, d. 7 on the question: utrum\npotentia generandi possit communicari Filio (whether the power to\ngenerate can be communicated to the Son) (1997, 342\u2013349). Olli\nHallamaa considers Wodeham\u2019s discussion of trinitarian\nparalogisms within the context of other fourteenth-century Franciscans\n(Hallamaa 2003). For our purposes Gelber\u2019s and Hallamaa\u2019s\nanalyses of trinitarian paralogisms are the most relevant\nphilosophically, as Wodeham debates the universality of Aristotelian\nlogic with respect to the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nLike many of his Oxford contemporaries, Adam Wodeham was particularly\nconcerned with solving the tension between Aristotelian logic and\ntrinitarian theology. In the Lectura secunda, Wodeham did not\naddress the problem in a substantial way (see LS III, 446\u2013448),\nalthough in the Ordinatio he devotes a specific question to\nthe problem of whether there is a \u201ccertain rule or art\u201d\nthrough which one can solve trinitarian paralogisms (OO I, d. 33, q.\n3).\n\nThe problem of trinitarian paralogisms arises when one considers\ncertain syllogisms regarding the Trinity. God, according to Church\nteaching, is one simple divine essence and three distinct divine\npersons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). And, when some valid syllogisms\nare formulated according to Aristotelian rules, paradoxes arise in\nwhich both premises are true and the conclusion is false. For\nexample:\n\n\nThis divine essence is the Father\nHaec essentia divina est Pater \n\nThis divine essence is the Son\nHaec essentia divina est Filius \n\nTherefore, the Son is the Father\nErgo Filius est Pater. \n\n\nIn this valid expository syllogism, both of the premises are true\naccording to Church teaching, but the conclusion is false. The\ntheologians of the first half of the fourteenth century developed two\nstrategies when confronting such syllogisms. First, some theologians\ndenied the universality of Aristotelian logic outside of the natural\norder. This approach, which remained in the minority, can be found in\nthe author of the Centiloquium theologicum (OPh VII,\n\u00a7\u00a056\u201359, 469\u2013472) and in Robert Holcot\u2019s\ncommentary on the Sentences (Holcot 1518, q. 5) (albeit\nHolcot\u2019s position changes in other parts of his corpus, cf.\nGelber 1974). In his commentary, Holcot remains ambiguous about his\neventual solution, although he writes that there are two logics: the\nlogic of faith (logica fidei) and the logic of the natural\norder (logica naturalis). Second, and more moderately, most\ntheologians insisted that Aristotelian logic is universal\u2014thus,\nvalid in both the natural and supernatural realms\u2014but that the\ntrinitarian syllogisms in question are not valid syllogisms, despite\ntheir seemingly valid form. This approach was shared by William of\nOckham and Adam Wodeham.\n\nAdam Wodeham, in the first two questions of distinction 33, surveys\nthe traditional methods of solving the problem of trinitarian\nparalogisms (Gelber 1974, 235\u2013253), and in the third question\nfinally offers his own response. It is not possible to recount all of\nWodeham\u2019s methods for addressing such paralogisms, but it is\nuseful to consider the following syllogism:\n\n\nEvery divine essence is the Father\n\nOmnis essentia divina est Pater \n\nEvery divine essence is the Son \nOmnis essentia divina est Filius \n\nTherefore, the Son is the Father \nErgo Filius est Pater. \n\n\nIn the above case, the two premises are universal. As such, the\nsyllogism should be governed by \u201call or none\u201d: meaning\nthat, with respect to a given subject and predicate, what is said of\nall (dici de omni) of the subject (essence) must also be said\nof the predicate (Father) (OO I, d. 33, q. 3, a. 2). In the above\nargument, there is a fallacy of the figure of speech because not\neverything said of the divine essence is predicable to the Father,\nbecause the term divine essence (subject) supposits for the\nSon and Holy Spirit while the term Father (predicate) does\nnot. Thus, the premise is not sufficiently universal and violates the\nrules of a valid expository syllogism (Gelber 1974, 255\u2013256).\nThis is one of Wodeham\u2019s methods for addressing trinitarian\nparalogisms, and effectively captures his basic method and approach to\nsuch problems. Further, it helps elucidate Wodeham\u2019s broader\napproach to the role of Aristotelian logic within theology and his\ncharacteristically \u201canalytic\u201d approach to questions of\nphilosophical theology.\n6. Natural Philosophy\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s Tractatus de indivisibilibus and\nTractatus alphabeticus establish him as one of the leading\nrepresentatives of the theologia Anglicana. This group of\nthinkers, including the Oxford Calculators, was heavily influenced by\nnatural philosophy and its implications for a range of philosophical\nand theological problems. Wodeham\u2019s discussion of the\ncontinuum and the latitude of forms demonstrates his place\nwithin this philosophical tradition.\n6.1 The Continuum\n\nAdam Wodeham, like many of his English contemporaries in the first\ndecades of the fourteenth century, was embroiled in the debate over\ndivisibilism and indivisibilism (atomism). Following William of\nOckham, Adam Wodeham was a divisibilist who argued in his\nTractatus de indivisibilibus against philosophical atomism\n(indivisibilism). Wodeham cites extensively from the writings of\ndivisibilists and indivisibilists, such that his Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus is a rich source for tracing the history of this\nlong and complex debate (Wood 1988, 14).\n\nAristotle, in the sixth book of the Physics, develops several\narguments against the idea that continua are composed of\natoms or indivisibles. The majority of medieval philosophers accepted\nAristotle\u2019s position, but by the end of the thirteenth century\nthere developed a minority opinion that supported indivisibilism. The\nmost famous proponents of indivisibilism were Robert Grosseteste (d.\n1253), Henry Harclay (d. 1317), Walter Chatton (d. 1343), Gerard Odon\n(d. 1349), William Crathorn (fl. 1330s) and Nicholas Bonet (d. 1360).\nThe divisibilists/indivisibilist debate in the fourteenth century was\nconcerned with the philosophical status of space and time.\nSpacial-temporal reality, according to the traditional Aristotelian\nview, was infinitely divisible. Thus, authors like Thomas Bradwardine\nand Adam Wodeham follow Aristotle and Averroes in defending the view\nthat the continuum is composed of divisible parts without\nend, and not of atoms. This view (divisibilism) is the one defended by\nAdam Wodeham in his magisterial Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus.\n\nIn response to the classical divisibilist position supported by\nAristotle, the indivisibilists held that there were\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d which constituted the composition of\ntemporal and spatial continua, e.g., temporal instants and\nlines respectively. Such \u201cindivisibles\u201d, in the early\n14th century, were understood to be an extended and simple\nontological unit, but not physical atoms per se. It is\nhelpful here to consider briefly an indivisibilist account, before\nturning to the divisibilism of Wodeham.\n\nHenry Harclay and Walter Chatton are two relatively well known\nmedieval philosophers who supported indivisibilism. Thinkers such as\nHarclay and Chatton argued, in response to Aristotle, for the\npossibility that a continuum is composed of indivisibles. The\nindividual components, or indivisibles, were generally held to be\nextensionless regardless of whether or not the individual thinker\nunderstood there to be an infinite (Harclay) or finite (Chatton)\nnumber of indivisibles in a given continuum. But, as is well\nknow, such indivisibilists accounts were generally so defensive in\ntheir posture\u2014arguing for the mere possibility of\nindivisibles\u2014that it is difficult to ascertain the broader\nphilosophical motivations which grounded such arguments. John Murdoch\nargues that there are perhaps two motives that can be gleamed for the\ntexts: (1) indivisibles may have been useful as a method of accounting\nfor the motion of angels; or (2) indivisibles may have been useful\nwhen addressing the inequality of infinites (Murdoch 1982,\n576\u2013577). Although, he notes that such motivations are mentioned\nonly in passing and that a broader motivation could have simply been\nthat \u201cthe analysis of Aristotle\u2019s arguments against\nindivisibilism uncovered loopholes in them\u201d (Murdoch 1982,\n577).\n\nThe Tractatus de indivisibilibus consists of five questions\nand it is instructive to consider the content briefly.\n\n In the first question, containing three articles, Wodeham\nconsiders whether or not forms, or extended continua, are\ncomposed of indivisibles. In the first article Wodeham develops twelve\narguments against the indivisibilists, anticipates responses to those\narguments, and rejects them (TI 35\u201393). In the second article,\nhe considers twelve arguments, from Henry Harclay and Walter Chatton,\nin support of the thesis that forms are composed of indivisibles (TI\n93\u2013101). And, in the third article, Wodeham responds to the\narguments of Harclay and Chatton (TI 103\u2013121). This first\narticle comprises about a third of the work, and the first article in\nparticular contains many of Wodeham\u2019s most significant\narguments.\nIn the second question, Wodeham treats the problem of whether or\nnot extended forms or objects are composed of indivisibles. In\nresponse, Wodeham (following Ockham) argues in the first article\nagainst the existence of points, lines or surfaces (TI 123\u2013139).\nAnd, as with the previous question, the second and third articles\nconsider arguments in defense of indivisibles and responses to those\narguments (TI 139\u2013163).\nThe third question entertains seven doubts relating to the\ndivisibilist position. In the first four doubts Wodeham treats\nZeno\u2019s famous paradoxes (as reported by Aristotle in his\nPhysics VI) (TI 165\u2013183), and in the last three doubts\nhe treats more contemporary arguments (TI 183\u2013211).\nThe fourth question considers whether or not a continuum\nis infinitely divisible. Thus, if a continuum can be divided,\nwhy cannot it be infinitely divided? To this question Wodeham provides\nan argument that a continuum cannot be divided (a. 1) (TI\n213\u2013225) and an argument to the contrary (a. 2) (TI\n225\u2013235).\nThe final question considers whether or not there are more parts,\nof the same proportion, in a larger continuum than in a\nsmaller one. In three articles, Wodeham considers an argument for the\nclaim that there are more respective parts in a larger\ncontinuum (a. 1) (TI 239\u2013247), objections to this\nargument (a. 2) (TI 247\u2013261), and finally replies to the\nobjections (a. 3) (TI 261\u2013273).\n\n\nIn the second doubt of question 3 (LT 171\u2013175;\n\u00b613\u201320), as noted above, Wodeham considers the argument of\nZeno (recorded in Aristotle\u2019s Physics) against those\nwho argue that motion is compatible with the divisibility of a\ncontinuum. This particular argument, familiar to all students\nof ancient philosophy, is exemplary both of Wodeham\u2019s historical\napproach to the questions posed by the continuum and his own\nmethod of argumentation. Thus, it is instructive to consider the\nargument in some detail. Wodeham records Zeno\u2019s argument as:\n\n\nIf every continuum is infinitely divisible, then every movable object\ntraversing any space will reach the middle of that [space] before the\nend, and consequently it will reach the middle of the second half\nbefore reading [the end] of the completing [part] of that half, and\nthen [it will reach] the middle of that next fourth [before] its\ncompleting [part]. Therefore if such halves are infinite proportional\n[parts], and if it does not happen that [a moveable object] traverses\ninfinitely many [parts] in a finite time, then it is impossible that\nany space be traversed in a finite time. And consequently, it is\nimpossible that anything move locally (LT 172\u2013173;\n\u00b614).\n\n\nWodeham, who is a divisibilist, offers a response to Zeno\u2019s\n\u201cparadox\u201d because it is necessary to avoid the\nreductio ad absurdum (i.e., there is no motion) posed by the\nclaim that an infinitely divisible finite space is not\ntraversable.\n\nWodeham begins by considering Averroes\u2019s argument that\nAristotle, in the Physics VI, contradicts the \u201cwords,\nnot the substance, of Zeno\u2019s discourse\u201d (LT 173;\n\u00b615). But, Wodeham does not agree with Averroes\u2019s\ninterpretation of Aristotle, and he defends Aristotle\u2019s\nargument. Wodeham argues that Aristotle recognizes that Zeno\u2019s\nargument \u201csupposes falsely\u201d that it is \u201cnot possible\nto traverse something infinite \u2026 in a finite time\u201d (LT\n173; \u00b616), although he also correctly recognizes that there is\nmore to be said in response to Zeno. Further, Wodeham argues that\nAristotle recognized that there is an equivocation with respect to the\nterm \u201cinfinite\u201d as applied to a continuum of\nspace or time: infinite can be understood with respect to\n\u201cdivision\u201d, or with respect to \u201cinfinite\nends\u201d. That is, the term infinite can refer to the infinite\ndivisibility of a given finite continuum of space or time, or\nthe term can refer to the fact that space or time extends without end\nor termination (LT 173; \u00b617). Because of this equivocation, the\nphrase \u201ca moveable object may traverse infinitely many things in\na finite time\u201d can be understood in two ways: either (1) as\nstating that a moveable object traverses infinitely many things that\nare extensively never terminated in a finite time; or (2) as stating\nthat a moveable object traverse infinitely many non-equal things (that\na given continuum is divided into) in a finite time (LT\n173\u2013175; \u00b618). In the former sense the claim is false, in\nthe latter sense it is true. And, in this way, Aristotle solves\nZeno\u2019s \u201cparadox\u201d to Wodeham\u2019s\nsatisfaction.\n\nFinally, Wodeham analyzes William of Ockham\u2019s\ninterpretation\u2014in the Expositio Physicorum (OP V, ll.\n49\u201356)\u2014of Averroes\u2019s argument that Aristotle\naddresses the words and not the substance of Zeno\u2019s argument.\nWodeham, recording Ockham\u2019s argument, implies that\nOckham\u2019s reading of Averroes is too \u201ccharitable\u201d,\nconcluding that \u201cif [Averroes] did understand [the matter] in\nthe manner expounded here, both his exposition and what he expounds\nare false\u201d (LT 175; \u00b6175).\n\nAs demonstrated by this brief example, in the Tractatus de\nindivisibilibus Adam Wodeham engages at length with the ancient\nand medieval philosophical tradition. Further, throughout the work he\nquotes extensively from William of Ockham\u2019s Exposition\nPhysicorum and his Tractatus de quantitate. Wodeham also\nconsiders in detail the arguments of Henry Harclay and Walter Chatton,\nall of which provides a useful historical record of this heated\ndebate. But, ultimately, the work remains a barrage of arguments\nagainst the indivisibilist, or atomist, position as defended in the\nearly fourteenth century.\n6.2 The Latitude of Forms\n\nIn his minor work, the Tractatus alphabeticus, Wodeham takes\nup the question of qualitative change and offers a position that is\nconsistent with his overall opposition to atomism (cf. Wood 1990).\nAccording to Sylla, there were three dominant views of qualitative\nchange that shaped the context of the discussion: the succession\ntheory, the addition theory, and the admixture theory (Sylla 1973,\n230\u2013232). The succession and addition theory distinguish\nthemselves from the admixture theory in that they are both committed\nto the fact that qualitative forms themselves do not change in degree.\nRather it is the subject that changes in degree through the\nacquisition of a new qualitative form (cf. Sylla 1973, 232; Wood 1990,\n375). Wodeham, in relative concord with the views of Ockham and\nFitzRalph and against the Mertonian Campsall and his usual nemesis\nWalter Chatton, argues against the admixture theory. He claims that it\nis impossible for one and the same quality to be changed while\nretaining its identity. As Wood says: \n\n\nAddition and succession of forms theorists agree on this issue; in no\nsense is it true that the same form undergoes remission or\nintension\u2026strictly speaking it is the subject, not the form,\nwhich becomes more white, more hot or more charitable. (Wood 1990,\n375)\n\n\nA helpful analog can be found in the case of numbers. When the number\n9 is increased to 10, Wodeham understands the admixture theorist to be\nclaiming that the same form has been intensified, but he wonders how\nthis numerically identical form can really be said to retain its old\nidentity now that it has been increased to 10 and is no longer 9.\n\nWhile the succession and addition theorist are united in their\nopposition to any admixture, and while both believe that intension and\nremission occur in the subject and not in the qualitative form, they\ndisagree about just how this intension and remission occurs. In the\nTractatus alphabeticus, Wodeham shows himself to be numbered\namong the addition theorists. The key difference here is that the\nsuccession theorist believes that when a quality increases a new form\nof a given quality destroys and then replaces the old form. Wodeham\nand the addition theorist disagree. They hold that when qualitative\nchange happens, a new form is indeed acquired, but it does not destroy\nthe proceeding form. On the contrary, the new form takes in the\npreceding form as one of its parts. And here, the analogy of\nquantitative change is again helpful. When 9 increases to 10, the\nsuccession theorist argues that the old form of 9 is completely\ndestroyed and replaced by an entirely new form, where no part of the\nold form of 9 contributes to the new form of 10. In opposition, the\naddition theorist argues that when a quality increases, this is\nanalogous to the number 1 being added to 9, and through this addition,\nthe new form of 10 is created. In this case, the old form of 9 has not\nbeen destroyed, but rather becomes a part of the new whole.\n\nA critical underlying difference between the succession and addition\ntheorists is the question over whether forms are indivisible or can be\nperpetually broken down into smaller parts. The succession theorist\nthinks forms are indivisible and do not contain parts (Sylla 1973,\n231). But Adam Wodeham, in harmony with his general anti-atomists\nposition, argues that forms can be infinitely divided. In this way,\nthere is no trouble in saying that, through addition, a new form is\ncreated, which contains the old form as one of its parts.\n7. Ethics\n7.1 Moral Goodness\n\nSince the Lectura secunda does not extend beyond book I, the\nmoral philosophy of Adam Wodeham found in book IV of the\nOrdinatio has remained relatively unexamined. However, in\n1981 Marilyn Adams and Rega Wood edited the tenth question of Book IV\nof the Ordinatio, providing us with a glimpse into\nWodeham\u2019s moral philosophy.\n\nQuestion ten concentrates on the moral worth or goodness of an action.\nHere the philosophical debate is about whether the moral worth of\naction resides in the choice of the will alone (in the manner of Kant)\nor whether moral goodness can be ascribed to the performance of\nactions themselves, independent of the intention of the agent.\nWodeham\u2019s discussion is embedded in a larger Franciscan\ndiscussion, whose main players are Scotus and Walter Chatton on the\none hand, and Ockham and Wodeham on the other.\n\nThe discussion is grounded in the distinction between purely internal\nacts (or volitional acts, acts within the power of the will) and\nexternal acts (or acts that can only be indirectly controlled by the\nwill). In the case of the latter (an external act), the power of the\nwill is not sufficient, and another source of power is needed.\nScotus\u2019s position, as understood by Wodeham, states that while\nan external act can only be good if it falls under the control of the\nwill (cf. Adams and Wood 1981, 9), the external and indirectly\ncontrolled act can nevertheless contribute an additional\nmoral goodness beyond the moral value accrued through the act of\nvolition. The result is that while willing to do the right thing or\nbad thing is in itself praiseworthy or blameworthy, executing and\nperforming that act can impute to the agent further praise or blame,\ndepending on how well one performs the willed act (cf. Adams and Wood\n1981, 9).\n\nWodeham, like Ockham, finds this position rather confusing. If someone\nperforms a morally praiseworthy volition, but this volition is not\nable to be executed, the only reason for this failure of performance\nis some impotency within the agent. But Wodeham insists that no one\nshould be damned for not doing what is not in their power to do (OO\nIV, 57\u201359, ll. 11\u201330; cf. Adams and Wood 1981, 14). Thus,\nno one can earn more merit for simply having the potency to perform\nthe action that they willed meritoriously. Having or not having the\npotency to execute that volition does not fall under the free power of\nthe agent, and, even for Scotus, only those acts that \u201care under\nthe free power of the agent\u201d are imputable acts (Adams and Wood\n1981, 9 and 14).\n7.2 Morality, the Will, and the Nature of Faith\n\nFor Walter Chatton, Ockham and Wodeham\u2019s position on the amoral\nstatus of external acts leads to unsavory consequences. Among other\nthings, Chatton is concerned about the implications of Wodeham\u2019s\nposition for the necessity of faith. Wodeham\u2019s reply not only\ngives us a nice illustration of how his moral theory plays out in\nconcrete instances, but also provides us with a helpful introduction\nto his position on the nature of belief and its connection to the\nwill.\n\nChatton is concerned that if one holds a position similar to the one\nof Wodeham there will no longer be any need for faith or belief, but\nonly the desire to believe. Chatton has this concern because, for him,\nthe act of belief is not directly under the control of the will (cf;\nOO IV 36, ll. 20\u201323). Wodeham responds by starkly distinguishing\nbetween two kinds of faith. Infused faith, which appears to be a pure\nact of the will and acquired faith which is not a direct act of the\nwill and is not required for salvation (OO IV 58, ll.13\u201314).\nPresumably, this act of acquired belief is an act of the intellect and\na response to the relative evidence of a given proposition or an\nentire syllogism taken together (see above An Evident\nJudgment).\n\nWith this distinction in place, Wodeham uses his moral theory to show\nthat the act of acquired belief, described as the act of believing\ncalmly (quiete) and presumably without intellectual\nhesitation or doubt, does not add any moral worth. This is the case\nsince, as we have already seen, if one wishes to believe, but is\nprevented from doing so by a lack of power, the agent should\nnot be held responsible for this lack of power. Reasons for such a\nlack of power include a melancholic disturbance, a passion, or sophism\n(OO IV 58, ll. 15\u201318). He further concludes, it is quite\npossible that the person who wishes to believe, but is not able to do\nso calmly (quiete), may be more morally praiseworthy than the\nperson who intellectually believes \u201cquietly\u201d and is not\nbeset by doubt. Intriguingly, he critiques Lombard at this point,\nsaying: \n\n\nIf the Master means to say that in order to achieve salvation one must\nbelieve with something more than a perfect will, but must also have\nbelief calmly (quiete), then he does think\ncorrectly\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. (OO IV 58, ll. 26\u201329)\n\n",
