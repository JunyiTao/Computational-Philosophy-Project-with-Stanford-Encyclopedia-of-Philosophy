On many construals, the core of truthmaker theory\nis considered to be the idea that truth depends\u2014or\nsupervenes\u2014on being (Bigelow 1988: 133; see\nalso Armstrong 2004, Schaffer 2010a, and Liggins 2012). Recently, some\nhave resisted this idea (e.g., Merricks 2007), but it does remain\npopular among truthmaker theorists (for discussion, see the separate\nentry on\n truthmakers).\n Moreover, the connection between truthmaking and ontological\ndependence has been a part of truthmaker theory from the very\nbeginning; Mulligan, Simons, and Smith (1984: 294) rely on\nHusserl\u2019s work on ontological dependence in their introduction\nof the idea of truthmaking (for further discussion of Husserl\u2019s\nwork regarding dependence, see Simons 1982 and Johansson 2004: Ch. 9).\nMore precisely, it seems there must be some way in which the world is\nin virtue of which true propositions are true, but the world itself is\nnot symmetrically dependent on truth; there is an asymmetric\ndependence relation between truth and being (accordingly, this\ndependence needs to be expressed with an asymmetric notion of\ndependence, see\n \u00a73\n above).\n\nHowever, popular though it is, this view is not entirely\nuncontroversial. For instance, MacBride (2014) argues that there is no\nneed to appeal to truthmaking to explain this type of asymmetric\ndependence between truth and being. In fact, there are reasons to\nthink that truthmaking cannot explain the asymmetry, at least\nnot on the basis of the idea that truth supervenes on being. Part of\nthe confusion here seems to surround the relevant notion of\nsupervenience. On Armstrong\u2019s (2004: 8) construal, the relevant\nnotion of supervenience is symmetric: truth supervenes on being, but\nbeing also supervenes on truth. So it appears that the required\nasymmetry cannot arise from supervenience itself (see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005). While these problems must be settled\nelsewhere, it suffices to say that some variety of\nontological dependence is no doubt at work in truthmaker\ntheory\u2014there is an on-going debate as to how truthmaking should\nbe specified. One recent suggestion that may have some mileage is that\nthe relevant asymmetry could be recovered if truthmaking is understood\nas truth-grounding, that is, some entity x grounds the\ntruth of some proposition p if p is true in virtue of\nthe existence of x (see Tahko 2013 for discussion).\n",
