    "main_text": "Epistemological Issues || Mitigated Skepticism and Probabilism\n4.2 Mitigated Skepticism and Probabilism\n\nRichard Popkin has remarked that the great originality of La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences resides not so much in its\narguments against the skeptics, as in the fact that this defense of\n\u201cthe truth of the sciences\u201d concedes so much to the\nskeptical outlook. Most of the skeptical claims that are propounded\neither by the skeptic or by the Christian philosopher are not really\nrefuted in the book. They are integrated in a novel view of what one\nshould expect of scientific enquiry, its true aims and prospects\n(Popkin 1956, 2003).\n\nThus, the Christian philosopher has no qualm with the skeptical\nrebuttal of the alchemist\u2019s claim to perfect knowledge in\nnatural matters. He freely admits that we cannot know everything, and\nespecially not the causes nor essences of physical things, that\nmen\u2019s capacity is limited by outward appearance and the surface\nof corporeal things. In the Questions inou\u00efes, Mersenne\nwent as far as to say that we cannot demonstrate the existence of the\nexternal world:\n\n\nAnd we do not have any demonstration by which we are able to persuade\nthe opinion of those who might maintain that the earth, the water, the\nstars, and all the bodies which we see are but appearances and\n\u201cspecies intentionales\u201d, supposing God might use these\nspecies or accidents to make all that we see appear to us. For one is\nnot able to say that one knows a single thing as one\nshould\u2014according to the laws and the notions which Aristotle and\nother philosophers give of science\u2014if one cannot demonstrate\nthat it is impossible that the reason which one supplies, or the thing\nwhich one proposes, be not true. That is enough to persuade those who\nuse reflection that there is nothing certain in physics and that there\nare so few certain things, that it is difficult to propound\nany\u2026 (QI XVIII: 53, translated in Mace 1970: 24\u201325)\n\n\nMersenne joins the skeptic in his condemnation of the\nAristotelian\u2019s far too optimistic view of science. What is\ndenounced is not so much Aristotle\u2019s physical doctrines or\nmethods (the Christian philosopher, for example, does not endorse the\nskeptical attacks against syllogistic) but rather a mistaken\nrepresentation of the epistemic aims of physics, which cannot aspire\nto perfect certainty. Bacon\u2019s experimental method received no\nmore favor in his eyes precisely on this account, as it serves a\nproject that is no less dogmatic (see Buccolini 2013):\n\n\nalthough one may anatomize, and dissolve bodies as much as one wishes,\nwhether by fire, by water, or by the force of the mind, one will never\narrive at the point of rendering our intellect equal to the nature of\nthings. That is why I believe that Verulam design is impossible. (VS\n212)\n\n\nMersenne did not think that our inability to understand the ultimate\ncause and intimate nature of things should be an object of lament. The\nmere knowledge of effects and appearances might be enough for human\nneeds. For one thing, it has enough pragmatic virtue, as it can serve\nus as a guide in our actions. Besides, as outwards appearances, crust\nand superficies may be rigorously described, through measurement and\nmathematics, the sort of knowledge that can be gained here is as\nperfect and certain as one could wish\u2014although not of the sort\ndogmatic physicians and metaphysicians are seeking.\n\nThus, according to Richard Popkin, Mersenne is not so much refuting\nskepticism as he is adopting an attenuated form of it. By openly\ndiscarding research on the causes and essences of phenomena, reducing\nthe whole of physical science to mathematical knowledge of accidents,\nthe study of external effects, and the establishment of the laws of\nappearances, he invents a \u201cmitigated skepticism\u201d, that\nPopkin considers as the first lucid expression of the modern\nscientific outlook, deemed to become dominant in the following\ncenturies. This outlook conjugates an entire confidence in the virtues\nof physico-mathematical sciences, with a complete positivism (that is,\na deliberate abstention) in regard metaphysical matters.\n\nRecent reappraisals of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological views tend to\ncontest, or at least qualify, Popkin\u2019s characterizations.\nAccording to Garber (2004), Mersenne\u2019s epistemological frame is\nold rather than new. The way he envisions the boundaries between\ndisciplines remains Aristotelian, and in particular his conception of\nthe \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences directly comes from\nthe Aristotelian definition of mixed or subaltern mathematics,\nsciences such as astronomy or optics, only dealing with accident and\nsurface properties of physical things. Far from offering a scientific\nsubstitute to Aristotelian physics, these sciences allow one to\napproach nature in a mathematical way \u201cwithout having to\nchallenge the full complex of Aristotelianism directly\u201d (2004:\n157) in ways that would be perceived as subversive of true religion\nand social order.\n\nDear\u2019s study (1988) similarly insists on the deliberately\n\u201cun-revolutionary\u201d character of Mersenne\u2019s\ncontribution to the \u201cscientific revolution\u201d. Mersenne\nnever chose to range himself against Aristotelianism, never cast\nhimself as an innovator. His agenda is formulated in a preexisting\nphilosophical idiom (the \u201clanguage of the schools\u201d), and\nhis ideas display a \u201cborrowed coherence\u201d rather than an\nintrinsic one. Mersenne was not a positivist avant la lettre;\nhe admitted that God knows what man cannot verify, that natural kinds\nexist in nature, that things do have essential definitions. His\n\u201cskeptical\u201d approach to physics is not so much a\nwatered-down Pyrrhonism intended to show the inconclusiveness of\nnatural philosophical demonstration, as it is an instrument to\nrecommend mathematical sciences as an anchor of certainty, where\nordinary natural philosophy stays in doubt and can only be defended in\na probabilistic way. When Mersenne confesses that many questions\ncannot he determined, he is not proposing to suspend judgment but\nrather to formulate a probable judgment by choosing the most\npersuasive opinions. This \u201cprobabilism\u201d is, according to\nDear, a legacy of humanist and Ciceronian dialectics, and it remained\nconstantly present in Mersenne\u2019s work, even though, on some\nquestions the weight of probabilities has changed. This was\nparticularly the case for the Copernican opinion. Judging it very\nunlikely in L\u2019Usage de la raison and in the\nQuaestiones, Mersenne eventually recognized that it was the\nopinion best suited to the phenomena observed and therefore the most\nprobable. However, God\u2019s freedom being never constrained,\nMersenne could accept with relative equanimity the final judgment of\nthe Church. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he was to\npublish a French translation of the inquisitorial condemnation and of\nGalileo\u2019s abjuration.\n\nDeparting from Garber and Dear\u2019s view as well as from\nPopkin\u2019s, Buccolini (2019) presents Mersenne\u2019s\nepistemological reflection in La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des\nsciences as resolutely anti-sceptical, and strongly connected\nwith the views expressed by the Jesuit mathematician, Guiseppe\nBiancani, in his dissertation on the nature of mathematics (Biancani\n1615), arguing for the certainty and scientific status of mathematics.\nAccording to Buccolini, Mersenne\u2019s doubts are directed not\nagainst science as such but against the Aristotelian doctrine of\ndemonstratio, his aim being to replace Aristotelian physics\nwith an entirely intelligible mathematical physics.\n",
