    "main_text": "Arguments Against Eliminative Materialism || Eliminativism Eliminated?\n4.4 Eliminativism Eliminated?\n\nOne final argument against eliminative materialism comes from the\nrecent writings of a former supporter, Stephen Stich (1991, 1996).\nStich\u2019s argument is somewhat complex, but it can be presented in\noutline form here. Earlier we saw that eliminative materialism is\ncommitted to the claim that the posits of folk psychology fail to\nrefer to anything. But as Stich points out, just what this claim\namounts to is far from clear. For example, we might think that\nreference failure occurs as the result of some degree of mismatch\nbetween reality and the theory in which the posit is embedded. But\nthere is no clear consensus on how much of a mismatch is necessary\nbefore we can say a given posit doesn\u2019t exist. Stich offers a\nvariety of reasons for thinking that there are fundamental\ndifficulties that will plague any attempt to provide principled\ncriteria for distinguishing cases of reference success from cases of\nreference failure. Consequently, the question of whether a theory\nchange should be ontologically conservative or radical has no clear\nanswer. Because eliminative materialism rests on the assumption that\nfolk psychology should be replaced in a way that is ontologically\nradical, Stich\u2019s account pulls the rug out from under the\neliminativist. Of course, this is a problem for the folk psychology\nrealist as well as the eliminativist, since Stich\u2019s skeptical\nargument challenges our grounds for distinguishing the two.\n",
