    "main_text": "Utilitarianism and Justice || Accommodating intuitions about justice\n4.1 Accommodating intuitions about justice\n\nMost utilitarians have regarded it as part of their task in defending\nutilitarianism to show that it can both accommodate and explain much\nof what we intuitively believe about justice. This is certainly true\nof two of the greatest among them, John Stuart Mill and Sidgwick, both\nof whom went to considerable lengths to show that familiar principles\nof justice could be given a utilitarian rationale (Mill\nUtilitarianism, ch. 5; Sidgwick 1874/1907, Book III, ch.5).\nBentham, in contrast, was more cavalier: \u2018justice, in the only\nsense in which it has a meaning, is an imaginary personage, feigned\nfor the convenience of discourse, whose dictates are the dictates of\nutility, applied to certain particular cases\u2019 (The\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation, pp. 125\u20136). If we\nfollow the lead of Mill and Sidgwick in wishing to take seriously how\njustice is commonly understood, the utilitarian has two challenges to\nface. First he or she must show that the demands of justice as\ncommonly understood correspond roughly to the rules that when followed\nby persons, or implemented by institutions, are most conducive to the\ngreatest happiness. They need not mirror the latter exactly, because\nutilitarians will argue, as both Mill and Sidgwick did, that our\nintuitions about justice are often ambiguous or internally\ninconsistent, but there must be enough overlap to warrant the claim\nthat what the utilitarian theory can accommodate and explain is indeed\njustice. (As Sidgwick (1874/1907, p. 264) put it, \u2018we\nmay, so to speak, clip the ragged edge of common usage, but we must\nnot make excision of any considerable portion\u2019.) Second, some\nexplanation must be given for the distinctiveness of justice. Why do\nwe have a concept that is used to mark off a particular set of\nrequirements and claims if the normative basis for these requirements\nand claims is nothing other than general utility? What accounts for\nour intuitive sense of justice? The task confronting the utilitarian,\nthen, is to systematize our understanding of justice without\nobliterating it.\n\nBy way of illustration, both Mill and Sidgwick recognize that\ndesert, of both reward and punishment, is a key component of\ncommon understandings of justice, but they argue that if we remain at\nthe level of common sense when we try to analyse it, we run into\nirresolvable contradictions. For instance, we are inclined to think\nthat a person\u2019s deserts should depend on what they have actually\nachieved \u2013 say the economic value of what they have produced\n\u2013 but also, because achievement will depend on factors for which\nthe person in question can claim no credit, such as inborn talent,\nthat their deserts should depend only on factors for which they are\ndirectly responsible, such as the amount of effort they expend. Each\nof these conceptions, when put into practice, would lead to a quite\ndifferent schedule of rewards, and the only means to escape the\nimpasse, these utilitarians claim, is to ask which schedule will\ngenerate most utility by directing people\u2019s choices and efforts\nin the most socially productive way. Similar reasoning applies to the\nprinciples of punishment: the rules we should follow are the rules\nthat are most conducive to the ends for which punishment is\ninstituted, such as deterring crime.\n\nTo explain the distinctiveness of justice, Mill suggests that it\ndesignates moral requirements that, because of their very great\nimportance to human well-being, people have a right to have\ndischarged, and are therefore matters of perfect obligation. A person\nwho commits an injustice is always liable to punishment of some kind,\nhe argues. So he explains our sense of justice in terms of the\nresentment we feel towards someone who breaches these requirements.\nSidgwick, who laid greater stress than Mill on the connection between\njustice and law, also underlined the relationship between justice and\ngratitude, on one side, and resentment, on the other, in order to\ncapture the way in which our concern for justice seems to differ from\nour concern for utility in general.\n",
