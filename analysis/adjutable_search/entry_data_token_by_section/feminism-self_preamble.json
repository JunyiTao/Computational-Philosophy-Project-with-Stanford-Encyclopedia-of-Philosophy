    "main_text": "\n\nThe topic of the self has long been salient in feminist philosophy,\nfor it is pivotal to questions about personal identity, the body,\nsociality, and agency that feminism must address. Simone de\nBeauvoir\u2019s provocative declaration, \u201cHe is the Subject, he\nis the Absolute\u2014she is the Other\u201d, signals the central\nimportance of the self for feminism. To be the Other is to be a\nnon-subject, a non-agent\u2014in short, a mere thing. Women\u2019s\nselfhood has been systematically subordinated or even outright denied\nby law, customary practice, and cultural stereotypes. Throughout\nhistory, women have been identified either as inferior versions of men\nor as their direct opposite, characterized through their perceived\ndifferences from men; in both cases, women have been denigrated on the\nbasis of these views. Since women have been cast as lesser forms of\nthe masculine individual, the paradigm of the self that has gained\nascendancy in Western philosophy and U.S. popular culture is derived\nfrom a masculine prototype. Feminists contend that the experiences of\npredominantly white and heterosexual, mostly economically advantaged\nmen who have wielded social, economic, and political power and who\nhave dominated the arts, literature, the media, and scholarship have\nbeen taken as universal and ideal. As a result, feminists have argued\nthat the self is not only a metaphysical issue for philosophy, but one\nthat is also ethical, epistemological, social, and political.\n\nResponding to this state of affairs, feminist philosophical work on\nthe self has taken three main tacks: (1) critiques of dominant modern,\nWestern views of the self, (2) reclamations of feminine identities,\nand (3) reconceptualizations of the self as (a) a dynamic, relational\nindividual beholden to unconscious desires and social bonds and (b)\nintersectional and even heterogeneous. The feminist\nreconceptualizations of the self have challenged standard\nphilosophical models for their biases and shifted the discipline\ntoward recognizing selfhood as a relational, multilayered phenomenon.\nThis entry will survey both critical and constructive feminist\napproaches to the self.\n",
