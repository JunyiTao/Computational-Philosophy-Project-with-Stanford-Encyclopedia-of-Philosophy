    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede\n2.  Theories of the Right to Secede\n\n\nIn the philosophical literature a putatively exhaustive distinction\nis drawn between two theories of the right to secede (understood as a\nunilateral claim-right): Remedial right only theories and\nprimary right \n theories.[5]\n Remedial right only\ntheories analogize the right to secede to the right to revolution,\nunderstanding it as a right that a group comes to have only as a result\nof violations of other rights. On this view secession is justified only\nas a remedy of last resort for persistent and serious injustices. The\nright to unilateral secession thus understood is not primary, but\nrather derivative upon the violation of other, more basic rights; hence\nthe label \u201cremedial right only.\u201d Sometimes the term\n\u201cjust cause theories\u201d is used to refer to remedial right\nonly theories and the term \u201cchoice theories\u201d to refer to\nprimary right theories.\n\n\nDifferent versions of remedial right only theories specify different\nlists of the injustices that can ground the remedial right. Consider,\nfor example, a remedial right only theory that includes among the\ngrounds for the (unilateral) right to secede the following: (a)\nlarge-scale and persistent violations of basic human rights, (b) unjust\ntaking of the territory of a legitimate state (where secession is\nsimply the taking back of wrongly taken territory, as with the\nsecession of the Baltic Republics from the Soviet Union in 1991), and\n(c) in certain cases, the state\u2019s persisting violation of\nagreements to accord a minority group limited self-government within\nthe state (Buchanan 2004) or perhaps even refusal to enter into\nnegotiations aimed at agreement on an intrastate autonomy regime. A\nmore austere remedial right only theory would recognize only (a),\npersistent, large-scale violations of basic human rights (in the most\nextreme case, genocide or other mass killings) as sufficient to justify\nunilateral \n secession.[6]\n\n\n\nPrimary right theories of the unilateral right to secede recognize\nthat a group can have a right to secede on remedial grounds, but they\ncontend that the (unilateral) right to secede can exist even when the\ngroup has not been subject to any injustice. This second type of theory\nthus holds that there is a right to unilateral secession over and above\nwhatever remedial and hence derivative right there may be.\n\n\nPrimary right theories are of two types: Ascriptivist\n(predominantly nationalist) theories and plebiscitary (or\nmajoritarian) theories. The former hold that certain groups whose\nmemberships are defined by what are sometimes called ascriptive\ncharacteristics, simply by virtue of being those sorts of groups, have\na unilateral (claim-)right to secede. Ascriptive characteristics are\nthose that are attributed to individuals independently of their choice\nand include being of the same nation or being a \u201cdistinct\npeople.\u201d The most common form of ascriptivist theory holds that\nnations as such have a right of self-determination that includes the\nright to secede in order to have their own state.\n\n\nPlebiscitary theories, in contrast, hold that the (pro\ntanto) unilateral moral claim-right to secede exists if a majority\nresiding in a portion of the state chooses to have their own state\nthere, regardless of whether or not they have any common\ncharacteristics, ascriptive or otherwise, other than the desire for\nindependence. They need not be co-nationals or members of a distinct\npeople or culture. Rather, they need only constitute a group that is\ncapable of establishing an autonomous government with the capacity to\nfulfill the political functions necessary for legitimacy.\n\n\nWhat the two types of primary right theories have in common is that\nthey do not require injustice as a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a unilateral (claim-)right to secede. They are primary\nright theories because they do not make the unilateral (claim-)right to\nsecede derivative upon the violation of other, more basic rights, as\nthe remedial right only theories \n do.[7]\n No attempt will\nbe made here to provide a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these\nrival theories (see Buchanan 1997). Instead, we will only identify\ntheir major strengths and weaknesses.\n",
