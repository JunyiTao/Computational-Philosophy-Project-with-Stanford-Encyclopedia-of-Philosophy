    "main_text": "The Phenomenology of Trans Embodiment\n9. The Phenomenology of Trans Embodiment\n Gayle Salamon's work (2010) concerns the phenomenology of gendered\nembodiment and, in particular, trans experiences of dissonance between\n\u201cfelt body\u201d and the external appearance of the body. She\nrevisits the dispute between Judith Butler (who claims that the\ngendered self is socially-constructed) and trans theorists, such as\nJay Prosser (1998) who, rather than taking transsexuality as evidence\nof the constructedness of gender, points to it as evidence of\nsomething that transcends such construction (1998, 7 and 65). Aside\nfrom arguing that Prosser misreads both Freud and Didier Anzieu (2010,\n39-40), Salamon defends the implausibility of viewing proprioceptive\nawareness of the body as somehow culturally-transcendent. She argues\nthat the body postulated in such a view is ultimately unrecognizable\nas human (88). In her view, \u201cthe same social forces that\nconstitute a body as culturally legible or illegible also shape the\nvery feelings of embodiment that would seem to be most personal, most\nindividual, and most immune to regulatory injunction\u201d (77).\n Drawing on the work of Schilder (1950), Salamon sees one\u2019s body\nimage as not innate, but as built up over time through experiential\ncontact with the world (including interactions with other people).  In\nlight of this, Salamon argues that the lack of fit between felt sense\nof body and external appearance of the body experienced by some trans\npeople is, in fact, pervasive - relevant to trans and non-trans folk\nalike: \u201cThe production of normative gender itself,\u201d she\nwrites, \u201crelies on a disjunction between the 'felt sense' of the\nbody and the body's corporeal contours and . . . this disjunction need\nnot be viewed as a pathological structure\u201d (2010, 2).\n Yet it is not clear how such an environmental account can explain\nthe genesis of trans experiences of \u201cwrong\u201d\nembodiment. Consider that not all trans women possess a conscious\nself-identity of being a woman (or a girl) from a very early age, and\nnot all trans men possess a conscious self-identity of being a man (or\nboy) from early on. Imagine, then a trans woman who is raised to see\nherself as male and to follow \u201cthe proper\u201d gender\nnorms. This person should, in the environmental account, develop a\nbody image that would be described as roughly 'male.' For in\naccordance with external gender norms and internalized gender\nidentity, this person will have generally had the types of interactive\nworldly-experiences that would be expected to yield such an\nimage. Thus, if there's such an image that's incongruent with assigned\ngender, it mustn't have been developed in that environmental way.\n In addition to possessing an internal perception of one's body,\nhowever, one is also affectively invested in one's body. That is, one\ntakes an interest in it and has strong emotions about it.  Salamon\nwrites, \u201cWithout that investment, our relationship to our bodies\nis one of depersonalized estrangement: my sense of the\n\u201dmine-ness\u201c of my own body-and, crucially, even my sense\nof its coherence-depends on this narcissistic investment\u201d (2010,\n42). This provides a way to move beyond the limitations of\n(socially-regulated) environmental experience insofar as such\naffective attitudes are not subject to the same type of\nworldly-constraint.\n\n\nThe challenge, however, is to explain this investment in such a way\nthat does not reduce to sexuality or forms of eroticism. Expressions\nsuch as Schilder's libinal investment have strong sexual\nconnotations. And the worry is that an appeal to such notions will\nreduce trans experiences of bodily dsyphoria to sexual\nfeelings. This is of particular concern in light of the long\nstanding tendency (as Salamon notes, 2010, 45) to construe\ntranssexuality in terms of sexual desire, to reduce cross-gender\nidentification to a kind of sexual fetish, and to elide trans gender\nbody dysphoria as a discrete phenomenon. Unfortunately in her\ndiscussion of this issue, Salamon appeals to Butler's notion of the\nmorphological imaginary which itself actually does appear to privilege\nthe sexual.  What remains to be explained - a serious lacuna - is the\nnon-sexual affective investment in the gendered body that presumably\nmust ground the disjunction between felt sense of gendered body and\nthe visual body in cases of trans bodily dysphoria. \n\n\nIn her own account of sexual desire, however, Salamon is notably\ncareful to avoid reducing transsexuality to eroticism. She is merely\ninterested instead, in accommodating trans experiences of sexuality in\na way that is not invalidating (2010, 45). Salamon draws on\nMerleau-Ponty's notions of the sexual schema and transposition.  In\nexperiencing sexual desire, one is oriented toward an object of\ndesire. In transposition, one's body (that \u201chouses\u201d) the\nsexual desire comes to be replaced by (or itself actually becomes) the\ndesire itself.  Salamon illustrates the point as follows. When I'm\nthirsty and reach for a glass of water, \u201cmy arm, unbent and\nreaching out, is no longer the location of my sensation but rather\nbecomes the gesture through which I am toward the other. The arm is\nthe conduit of desire, but not the seat of its sensation\u201d\n(54).\n\n\nIn Salamon's account, what's important is not the actual body part\nitself, but its role in sexual desire, and this process of\ntransposition: \u201cThe join between desire and the body is the\nlocation of sexuality, and that join may be a penis, or some other\nphallus, or some other body part, or a region of the body that is not\nindividuated into a part, or a bodily auxiliary that is not\norganically attached to the body\u201d (2010, 51). In this way,\nSalamon's appeal to Merleau-Ponty is similar to Butler's notion of the\nmorphological imaginary with respect to the role of the erotic in\nincorporating the part through a form of sexuality (or, actually, the\nwhole way of being toward another). Notably, however, Salamon's\naccount allows her to show how one's \u201cinternal sense of\ngender\u201d can become capable of being witnessed by others in the\nworld. For rather than talking merely about an internal feeling, we\nare talking about ways of being in the world, in interaction with\nothers.\n",
