    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || The Externalist Turn\n3.3 The Externalist Turn\n\nSince the early 1970s, views on lexical meaning were revolutionized by\nsemantic externalism. Initially, externalism was limited to proper\nnames and natural kind words such as \u2018gold\u2019 or\n\u2018lemon\u2019. In slightly different ways, both Kripke (1972)\nand Putnam (1970, 1975) argued that the reference of such words was\nnot determined by any description that a competent speaker associated\nwith the word; more generally, and contrary to what Frege may have\nthought, it was not determined by any cognitive content associated\nwith it in a speaker\u2019s mind (for arguments to that effect, see\nthe entry on\n names).\n Instead, reference is determined, at least in part, by objective\n(\u201ccausal\u201d) relations between a speaker and the external\nworld. For example, a speaker refers to Aristotle when she utters the\nsentence \u201cAristotle was a great warrior\u201d\u2014so that her\nassertion expresses a false proposition about Aristotle, not a true\nproposition about some great warrior she may \u201chave in\nmind\u201d\u2014thanks to her connection with Aristotle himself. In\nthis case, the connection is constituted by a historical chain of\nspeakers going back to the initial users of the name\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019, or its Greek equivalent, in baptism-like\ncircumstances. To belong to the chain, speakers (including present-day\nspeakers) are not required to possess any precise knowledge of\nAristotle\u2019s life and deeds; they are, however, required to\nintend to use the name as it is used by the speakers they are picking\nup the name from, i.e., to refer to the individual those speakers\nintend to refer to.\n\nIn the case of most natural kind names, it may be argued, baptisms are\nhard to identify or even conjecture. In Putnam\u2019s view, for such\nwords reference is determined by speakers\u2019 causal interaction\nwith portions of matter or biological individuals in their\nenvironment: \u2018water\u2019, for example, refers to this\nliquid stuff, stuff that is normally found in our rivers,\nlakes, etc. The indexical component (this liquid,\nour rivers) is crucial to reference determination: it\nwouldn\u2019t do to identify the referent of \u2018water\u2019 by\nway of some description (\u201cliquid, transparent, quenches thirst,\nboils at 100\u00b0C, etc.\u201d), for something might fit the\ndescription yet fail to be water, as in Putnam\u2019s (1973, 1975) famous Twin\nEarth thought experiment (see the entry on\n reference).\n It might be remarked that, thanks to modern chemistry, we now possess\na description that is sure to apply to water and only to water:\n\u201cbeing H2O\u201d (Millikan 2005). However, even if\nour chemistry were badly mistaken (as in principle it could turn out\nto be) and water were not, in fact, H2O,\n\u2018water\u2019 would still refer to whatever has the same nature\nas this liquid. Something belongs to the extension of\n\u2018water\u2019 if and only if it is the same substance as this\nliquid, which we identify\u2014correctly, as we believe\u2014as\nbeing H2O.\n\nLet it be noted that in Putnam\u2019s original proposal, reference\ndetermination is utterly independent of speakers\u2019 cognition:\n\u2018water\u2019 on Twin Earth refers to XYZ (not to\nH2O) even though the difference between the two substances\nis cognitively inert, so that before chemistry was created nobody on\neither Earth or Twin Earth could have told them apart. However, the\nlabel \u2018externalism\u2019 has been occasionally used for weaker\nviews: a semantic account may be regarded as externalist if it takes\nsemantic content to depend in one way or another on relations a\ncomputational system bears to things outside itself (Rey 2005; Borg\n2012), irrespective of whether such relations affect the\nsystem\u2019s cognitive state. Weak externalism is hard to\ndistinguish from forms of internalism on which a word\u2019s\nreference is determined by information stored in a speaker\u2019s\ncognitive system\u2014information of which the speaker may or may not\nbe aware (Evans 1982). Be that as it may, in what follows\n\u2018externalism\u2019 will be used to mean strong, or Putnamian,\nexternalism.\n\nDoes externalism apply to other lexical categories besides proper\nnames and natural kind words? Putnam (1975) extended it to artifactual\nwords, claiming that \u2018pencil\u2019 would refer to\npencils\u2014those objects\u2014even if they turned out not\nto fit the description by which we normally identify them (e.g., if\nthey were discovered to be organisms, not artifacts). Schwartz (1978,\n1980) pointed out, among many objections, that even in such a case we\ncould make objects fitting the original description; we would\nthen regard the pencil-like organisms as impostors, not as\n\u201cgenuine\u201d pencils. Others sided with Putnam and the\nexternalist account: for example, Kornblith (1980) pointed out that\nartifactual kinds from an ancient civilization could be re-baptized in\ntotal ignorance of their function. The new artifactual word would then\nrefer to the kind those objects belong to independently of\nany beliefs about them, true or false. Against such externalist\naccounts, Thomasson (2007) argued that artifactual terms cannot refer\nto artifactual kinds independently of all beliefs and concepts about\nthe nature of the kind, for the concept of the kind\u2019s creator(s)\nis constitutive of the nature of the kind. Whether artifactual words\nare liable to an externalist account is still an open issue (for\nrecent discussions see Marconi 2013; Bahr, Carrara & Jansen 2019;\nsee also the entry on\n artifacts),\n as is, more generally, the scope of application of externalist\nsemantics.\n\nThere is another form of externalism that does apply to all or most\nwords of a language: social externalism (Burge 1979), the\nview on which the meaning of a word as used by an individual speaker\ndepends on the semantic standards of the linguistic community the\nspeaker belongs to. In our community the word \u2018arthritis\u2019\nrefers to arthritis\u2014an affliction of the joints\u2014even when\nused by a speaker who believes that it can afflict the muscles as well\nand uses the word accordingly. If the community the speaker belongs to\napplied \u2018arthritis\u2019 to rheumatoids ailments in general,\nwhether or not they afflict the joints, the same word form would not\nmean arthritis and\nwould not refer to arthritis. Hence, a speaker\u2019s mental\ncontents, such as the meanings associated with the words she uses,\ndepend on something external to her, namely the uses and the standards\nof use of the linguistic community she belongs to. Thus, social\nexternalism eliminates the notion of idiolect: words only have the\nmeanings conferred upon them by the linguistic community\n(\u201cpublic\u201d meanings); discounting radical incompetence,\nthere is no such thing as individual semantic deviance, there are only\nfalse beliefs (for criticisms, see Bilgrami 1992, Marconi 1997; see\nalso the entry on\n idiolects).\n\nThough both forms of externalism focus on reference, neither is a\ncomplete reduction of lexical meaning to reference. Both Putnam and\nBurge make it a necessary condition of semantic competence on a word\nthat a speaker commands information that other semantic views would\nregard as part of the word\u2019s sense. For example, if a speaker\nbelieves that manatees are a kind of household appliance, she would\nnot count as competent on the word \u2018manatee\u2019, nor would\nshe refer to manatees by using it (Putnam 1975; Burge 1993). Beyond\nthat, it is not easy for externalists to provide a satisfactory\naccount of lexical semantic competence, as they are committed to\nregarding speakers\u2019 beliefs and abilities (e.g., recognitional\nabilities) as essentially irrelevant to reference determination, hence\nto meaning. Two main solutions have been proposed. Putnam (1970, 1975)\nsuggested that a speaker\u2019s semantic competence consists in her\nknowledge of stereotypes associated with words. A stereotype\nis an oversimplified theory of a word\u2019s extension: the\nstereotype associated with \u2018tiger\u2019 describes tigers as\ncat-like, striped, carnivorous, fierce, living in the jungle, etc.\nStereotypes are not meanings, as they do not determine reference in\nthe right way: there are albino tigers and tigers that live in zoos.\nWhat the \u2018tiger\u2019-stereotype describes is (what the\ncommunity takes to be) the typical tiger. Knowledge of\nstereotypes is necessary to be regarded as a competent speaker,\nand\u2014one surmises\u2014it can also be considered sufficient for\nthe purposes of ordinary communication. Thus, Putnam\u2019s account\ndoes provide some content for semantic competence, though it\ndissociates it from knowledge of meaning.\n\nOn an alternative view (Devitt 1983), competence on\n\u2018tiger\u2019 does not consist in entertaining propositional\nbeliefs such as \u201ctigers are striped\u201d, but rather in being\nappropriately linked to a network of causal chains for\n\u2018tiger\u2019 involving other people\u2019s abilities,\ngroundings, and reference borrowings. In order to understand the\nEnglish word \u2018tiger\u2019 and use it in a competent fashion, a\nsubject must be able to combine \u2018tiger\u2019 appropriately with\nother words to form sentences, to have thoughts which those sentences\nexpress, and to ground these thoughts in tigers. Devitt\u2019s\naccount appears to make some room for a speaker\u2019s ability to,\ne.g., recognize a tiger when she sees one; however, the respective\nweights of individual abilities (and beliefs) and objective grounding\nare not clearly specified. Suppose a speaker A belongs to a\ncommunity C that is familiar with tigers; unfortunately,\nA has no knowledge of the typical appearance of a tiger and\nis unable to tell a tiger from a leopard. Should A be\nregarded as a competent user \u2018tiger\u2019 on account of her\nbeing \u201cpart of C\u201d and therefore linked to a\nnetwork of causal chains for \u2018tiger\u2019?\n",
