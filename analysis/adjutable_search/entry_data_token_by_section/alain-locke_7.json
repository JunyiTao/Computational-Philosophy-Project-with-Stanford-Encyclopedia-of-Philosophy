    "main_text": "Relativism || The Principle of Cultural Equivalence\n4.1 The Principle of Cultural Equivalence\n\nRelativism, on Locke's view, is not a negative skeptical position that\nis predicated upon the belief that one is unable to make a\nsatisfactory determination about the relative worth of value\ncommunities. Instead, it is a positive and affirmative position\nconcerning the relative worth of distinct value traditions and\ncultures. Locke formulates his relativism in terms of the three\nprinciples of cultural equivalence, cultural reciprocity, and cultural\nconvertibility. He claims that the three principles are derivable from\nthis larger relativist outlook and will enable \u201ca more objective\nand scientific understanding of human cultures and\u2026more\nreasonable control of their interrelationships\u201d (CRIP 73).\n\nThe first of the three principles is:\n\nThe principle of cultural equivalence, under which we would\nmore wisely press the search for functional similarity in our analyses\nand comparisons of human cultures; thus offsetting our traditional and\nexcessive emphasis upon cultural differences. Such functional\nequivalences, which we might term \u2018culture-cognates\u2019 or\n\u2018culture-correlates,\u2019 discovered underneath deceptive but\nsuperficial institutional divergence, would provide objective but\nsoundly neutral common denominators for intercultural understanding\nand cooperation. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nThe effect of the first principle is to lay bare the fact that the\nseemingly vast differences between cultures is more a matter of our\nselective preferences; that is, the habits of mind we have cultivated\nfor being more keenly attuned to difference rather than similarity.\nThe first stage of relativism, then, is to reorient our focus in favor\nof the similarity to be found across value communities. Cultural\ncognates and correlates are objective because they are discovered to\nbe real features of multiple value systems. They are in an important\nsense \u201cthere\u201d to be discovered both by internal and\nexternal observers of the value group. The reason that these value\ncognates count as neutral is that they do not, in virtue of their\nbeing objective, privilege any value-type or value-content over any\nother. At this stage they are taken as mere facts of the matter about\nthe values that exist within communities.\n",
