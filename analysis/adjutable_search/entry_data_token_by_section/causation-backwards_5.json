    "main_text": "Philosophy || The Bilking Argument\n2.4 The Bilking Argument\n\nCan the bilking argument be challenged in such a way that the mere\npossibility of intervention does not generate any serious\nparadoxes? The bilking argument is due to Max Black (1956) who\nassumed the following scenario. Suppose Houdini makes a prediction\nabout the outcome of, say, a coin about to be flipped \\(B\\) before\nsomeone actually does the flipping \\(A\\). We may also assume that in\nthe past Houdini rarely failed in his predictions. In this case we\nmight be tempted to say that the Houdini\u2019s answer is caused by\nthe later flipping. But, as Black argued, after Houdini\u2019s\nprediction of \\(B\\), we can always intervene such that the coin is not\nflipped or arranged opposite to Houdini\u2019s prediction.  The\nimplication is that \\(A\\) seems both to be the cause and not to be the\ncause of \\(B\\). Black also argued that if \\(A\\) is the cause of \\(B\\),\nthen the causal antecedents of \\(A\\) are independent of \\(B\\). Hence,\nif we cannot, after \\(B\\) has occurred, prevent \\(A\\) from happening,\nthen \\(A\\) cannot be said to be causally independent of \\(B\\). But\nsince it is in human power to intervene with respect to \\(A\\), Black\nconcluded that \\(A\\) cannot be the cause of \\(B\\)\n Since manipulation and intervention is so central for\nour knowledge of causal relations, the image of our capability of\nintervening in the course of backward causation, after the alleged\neffect has occurred, seems to violate the whole idea that the notion\nof backward causation is coherent. However, the force of the bilking\nargument can, it seems, be weakened in various ways.\n\nFirst, one may hold that it is not a problem for our notion of\nbackward causation that we can in principle intervene in the course of\nthe events. Usually, we find out whether two events are causally\nconnected trough manipulation and intervention. In case we can produce\none event \\(Q\\) by bringing about another \\(P\\), or we can obstruct\none event \\(Q\\) by preventing another \\(P\\), we think that \\(P\\) is\nthe cause of (\\(Q\\). Likewise, we believe that if \\(P\\) causes \\(Q\\)\nin the relevant circumstances, we may be able to prevent \\(Q\\) from\nhappening if we intervene in the causal order after \\(P\\) occurs by\nchanging some of these circumstances, which make \\(P\\) causing \\(Q\\).\nShould \\(Q\\) occurs in spite of this intervention, there must under\nthe new circumstances be another event \\(X\\) rather than \\(P\\) that\ncauses \\(Q\\).\n\nNow, the bilking argument holds that backward causation is impossible\nbecause we can always intervene after we have observe that the alleged\neffect occurs and obstruct the alleged cause from occurring. Since\nnothing prohibits us from doing this whenever we want, it demonstrates\nthat backward causation does not take place. Indeed, if we actually\nintervene and prevent \\(A\\) after \\(B\\) has occurred, then of course a\nparticular later \\(A\\) (which does not exist) cannot be the cause of a\nparticular earlier \\(B\\) (which exists). But in all those cases where\nnobody actually intervenes, events of the same type as \\(A\\) may be\nthe cause of events of the same type as \\(B\\). This situation is not\ndifferent from what may happen in some cases of forward causation.\nAssume that \\(P\\) causes \\(Q\\) in the relevant circumstances. We may\nstill prevent a particular \\(P\\) from happening, but at the same time\na particular \\(Q\\) may nevertheless occur because in the given\ncircumstances it is caused by another event than \\(P\\).\n\nSecond, if a later event \\(A\\) really causes an earlier one \\(B\\),\nthen it would be impossible to intervene into the cause of the event\nafter \\(B\\) has happened and therefore impossible to prevent \\(A\\)\nfrom happening. If someone tries, she will by all means fail. It may\nintuitively sound strange as long as we think of backward causation as\nconsisting of something we can control directly by our everyday\nactions. But if backward causation is a notion that is applicable only\nto processes that human beings are unable to control in any\nforeseeable way the notion would not provoke our intuitions so\nmuch.\n\nBut even if we would have full control of backward causal processes\nand able to intervene in their cause of events, we may not, in such\ncases where we actually intervene, exclude backward causation from\ntaking place. Assume someone tosses a coin a minute after the magician\nHoudini has predicted whether it would be heads or tails. Furthermore,\nassume that Houdini\u2019s predictions are highly correlated with the\noutcomes of the tossed coin. Presumably, no such high correlation\nwould exist unless we were facing a case of backward causation.\nHowever, it turns out that the construction of a correlation may\nbehave differently depending on whether we consider Houdini\u2019s\npredictions to be purely physical events or to have a semantic\ncontent.\n\nIn an example like the one mentioned it is reasonable to think that we\ndiscover the correlation between Houdini\u2019s predictions and the\nsubsequent outcomes of the tossed coin by comparing the semantic\ncontent of the predictions with one of the two iconic sides of the\ncoin that define the semantic content. The side facing up determines\nwhether the prediction is true or not. First, in order to establish a\ncausal correlation between the content of the predictions and the\noutcome of the tosses we would look for a high percentage of correct\nstatements made by Houdini. This is an epistemically necessary\ncondition for establishing a causal correlation. Second, there cannot\nontologically be a causal correlation between the semantic content of\nHoudini\u2019s prediction and the (reading of) outcome of the head or tail if no flipping of the coin takes place. His predictions would not\ncarry any truth-value and we would think of them as pure guesses.\nHence, when someone attempts to bilk this experiment, he or she will\neither arrange the outcome opposite to the content of Houdini\u2019s\nprediction or abstain from flipping the coin.\n\nHowever, one might suggest that a possible reply to Black\u2019s\nbilking argument is to say that both tossing the coin and preventing\nthe toss may backwardly cause Houdini\u2019s behavior. That the\npreclusion of the coin from being tossed may be a cause of\nHoudini\u2019s response has also been proposed by Brian Garrett\n(2020). But he argues, in contrast to the scenarios described below,\nthat the lack of flipping the coin may be the direct cause of the\nHoudini\u2019s earlier prediction (because of backward causal preemption)\nand not only the cause of an earlier lack of prediction. Thus, it\nseems at least consistent to argue that both the toss and the\nprevention could cause Houdini\u2019s earlier behavior regardless of\nwhether this behavior is a prediction or the lack of a prediction, but\nonly as long as we consider both actions to be physical\nevents. Indeed, if we solely consider Houdini\u2019s prediction\n(regardless of its semantic content) or his lack of prediction as\npurely physical events and do the same with the actions \u201ctossing\nthe coin\u201d and \u201cpreventing tossing the coin,\u201d we may\nhave a high correlation of these physical events.\n\nThus, it seems that we have three scenarios in which we can observe\nbackward causation even though in two of them one may attempt to bilk\nthe cause after the alleged effect has occurred.\n\nScenario 1: The experimenter asks Houdini to predict the outcome of a\ntossed coin a minute later. It turns out that there is a high positive\ncorrelation between Houdini\u2019s answers and the actual heads or\ntails.\n\nScenario 2: The experimenter now asks Houdini to make his predictions,\nbut arranges the coin such that it shows heads or tails opposite to\nHoudini\u2019s pronouncements. In this case, there will be a negative correlation between the semantic content of his answers and the\noutcome of the tosses. (Indeed, you could also arrange the outcome so\nthere would be no correlation at all.) But one could still argue that\nthe very fact that Houdini did not abstain from responding was because\nthe physical act of handling the coin automatically prompted him to\nproduce an answer. One will observe a high positive correlation\nbetween Houdini making physical pronouncements and the physical\nhandlings of the coin, although there exists a negative or no\ncorrelation between the semantic content of his answers and the\noutcomes in the form of heads and tails.\n\nScenario 3: The experimenter asks Houdini to make his predictions.\nHowever, he abstains in situations where someone subsequently prevents\nthe coin from flipping, but in situations where no one intervenes;\nthere is a high correlation between his predictions and the outcomes.\nIn those cases where someone prevents the coin from being flipped, and\nHoudini therefore abstains from saying anything, there cannot be any\ncorrelation between the truth-value of Houdini\u2019s answers (since\nhe does not produce any). However, there still seems to be a high\ncorrelation between his behaviors (i.e. the physical lack of responses)\nand the subsequent prevention of any outcome.\n\nFor those reasons one may argue that the bilking argument is not as\npowerful as Max Black might have thought.\n2.5 Free will\n\nDoes backward caution imply fatalism? An often advanced\nobjection against backward causation is that if eternalism and\nbackward causation are possible, then the future is already\ndetermined. And if it is already determined now what the future is\ngoing to be, then it does not matter what an agent will do, since\neverything in the future is set and done. An agent cannot do other\nthan what the future is determined to be. Although this argument seems\nvery appealing, it may not hold for a closer scrutiny.\n\nBeing an eternalist one may distinguish between a determined\nfuture and a determinate future. Also this pair of concepts\nhave different names in the literature. Sometimes determinism\nis called physical determinism, causal determinism\nor nomological determinism, whereas determinateness\nis named logical determinism, temporal determinism,\nor block determinism. A future event is determined now if and\nonly if a present event is causally or nomologically sufficient for it\nto happen. In contrast, a future event is determinate with respect to\nthe present if and only if this event occurs tenselessly at a\nfuture time. Thus, eternalists will say that an agent still has a\nchoice to make tomorrow about whether or not she will go and see her\nparents, because no present event causally determined her choice\ntomorrow. Her choice is nevertheless determinate, and therefore it is\ntrue today what she will do tomorrow.\n\nThe discussion of free will has a long history and the overwhelming\nparts of this discussion has been dedicated to the problem that if the\nworld is completely governed by deterministic laws, does it then make\nsense to talk about free will? Indeed, the outcome of this discussion\nvery much depends on how we understand the notion of free will.\nUsually the concept of free will connects to whether or not a human\nagent could have done otherwise. Some philosophers, the\ncompatibilists, believe that as long a human agent is not subject to\nany external or internal forces, that individual is free to do\nwhatever he or she wants. But then the compatibilists have to dismiss\nsome part of the following argument of consequence.\n\nWe cannot change the past.\nWe cannot change the laws of nature.\nHence, we cannot change either the past or the laws of nature\n(by 1 and 2).\nIf determinism is true, then our present actions are necessary\nconsequences of the past and the laws of nature.\nHence, if determinism is true, then we can do nothing now to\nchange the fact that our present actions are necessary consequences of\nthe past and the laws of nature (by 4).\nHence, if determinism is true, then we cannot change that our\ncurrent actions occur (by 3 and 5).\nHence, if determinism is true, then we have no power to do things\ndifferently than what we do (by 6).\nFree will requires a power to do things differently.\nHence, if determinism is true, then we do not have free will (by 7\nand 8).\n\n\nThe non-compatibilist will argue that we have free will in the sense\nthat we could have done otherwise. Hence determinism cannot be\ntrue.\n\nIndeed, the compatibilist will accept (1), because even an advocate of\nbackward causation does not claim that the past can be changed.\nMoreover, the compatibilist does not have to accept backward\ncausation. Most likely the compatibilist will not challenge the\nnon-compatibilist by saying that we may be able to influence the past.\nIt is much more likely that the compatibilist will object to the\nargument either by saying that not all laws of nature are\ndeterministic or by saying that the brain operates based on\nceteris paribus laws including a clause of the absence of\nexternal and internal forces. For the compatibilist this suffices to\nsay that the agent could have done otherwise. In other words, the\ncompatibilist\u2019s objection would usually not concern the\ndeterminateness of the past.\n\nAs we can see, the above argument of consequence combines\ndeterminateness of the past and determinism of laws. Whatever the\ncompatibilist would object in order to reject the argument of\nconsequence, the argument cannot be used mutatis mutandis to\nargue against eternalism or the block universe, because in contrast to\nthe discussion of free will and the past that focuses on determinism,\nthe discussion of free will and the future focuses on determinateness.\nFor even if indeterminism is true, i.e. if some processes of nature\nare indeterministic, one could still argue in favor of the block\nuniverse as some of its advocates pointed out long time ago (See\nGr\u00fcnbaum, 1967, 28\u201335). Therefore, the argument against backward\ncausation based on free will has to be different from the one posed\nagainst traditional fatalism. It has to look something like this:\n\nIf backward causation is possible, then the future has to be\ndeterminate.\nIf the future is determinate, it is now the case that a wanted\naction occurs at a later time t or it is now the case that it\ndoes not occur at this later time t(by 1).\nIf it is now the case that a wanted action occurs at a later time\nt or it is now the case that it does not occur at this later\ntime t, I cannot perform a wanted action that does not occur\nat this later time t.\nHence if I cannot form a wanted action at a later time t,\nthen I cannot be free to do otherwise (2 and 3).\nNow, assuming that the future is determinate.\nHence, I am not free to do otherwise (by 4 and 5).\nHence, I have no free will.\nHowever, I know from experience that I could have done\notherwise.\nHence, the future is not determinate.\nHence, backward causation is not possible.\n\n\nA common criticism has been that if the agent\u2019s actions tomorrow\nare determinate, and it is therefore true today that the agent, say,\nwill visit her parents, then the agent cannot do anything other than\nvisit her parents. However, this conclusion seems to be a non\nsequitur. In order to reach such a conclusion, one must tacitly\nassume that the agent\u2019s action causally determines the outcome\nof her choice, whereas the argument were believed to show that\nbackward causation violates the notion of free will.\n\nIn contrast, the eternalist could argue that the reason why it is true\ntoday that an agent will visit her parents tomorrow is because the\nagent makes a decision that causally determines her visit before she\ngoes to see them. If the agent makes the opposite decision tomorrow,\nit will be true today that she will not visit her parents. Whatever\nshe chooses tomorrow, it will be her decision which makes it true\ntoday that she is going to see her parents. The outcome of her\ndecision tomorrow is determinate not because the present\ntruth value fixes her decision but because her future outcome fixes\nthe present truth value. (Nor is it the case that the outcome of her\ndecision causally determines her previous decision.) Thus, the\neternalist may argue that even though the future is determinate, it\ndoes not exclude people from having free will. If people have free\nwill, the argument goes, the fact that the outcome of their future\ndecision is determinate with respect to the past does not affect their\nability to choose freely.\n3. Paradoxes\n\nOf all the philosophical problems to which backward causation (and\ntime travel) gives rise, the paradoxes are those that have generated\nthe most heat in both physics and philosophy because, if they are\nvalid, they exclude backward causation from being both metaphysically\nand logically possible. The paradoxes can grossly be divided into\nthree kinds: (1) Bootstrap paradoxes involve a causal or information\nloop; (2) Consistency paradoxes involve generating a possible\ninconsistency; and (3)Newcomb\u2019s paradox seems to foreclose free\nwill. So if backward causation (and time travel) should be logically\npossible, one has to show that the paradoxes can be resolved and that\ntherefore arguments based on them are invalid.\n3.1 The Bootstrap Paradoxes\n\nThe bootstrap paradoxes arise in cases where you have a causal chain\nconsisting of particular events in which \\(a\\) causes \\(b, b\\) causes\n\\(c\\), and \\(c\\) causes \\(a\\). The problem here is that the occurrence\nof \\(a\\) presupposes the occurrence of \\(c\\); in other words, the\ncause presupposes its effect. But how can something be required of\nwhat itself requires? Indeed this seems paradoxical. Some philosophers\ntherefore think that this makes the idea of causal loops incoherent.\nHugh Mellor even believes that \n\n\nthe possibility of causal loops can be excluded a priori, and\nso therefore can the closed timelike paths entailed by closed time,\nbackward time-travel and all kinds of backward causation. (1991: 191).\n\n\n\nHis proof goes like this. Take four chains of events. Each of them\nconsists of three particular events \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\), all different\ntokens of the same kind of events \\(A, B\\) and \\(C\\). We then\nconstruct the chain such that\n\n\\(b \\Rightarrow c \\Rightarrow a\\)\n\\({\\sim}b \\Rightarrow{\\sim}c \\Rightarrow{\\sim}a\\)\n\\(b \\Rightarrow c \\Rightarrow{\\sim}a\\)\n\\({\\sim}b \\Rightarrow{\\sim}c \\Rightarrow a\\)\n\n\nThe first two sequences may be called G-chains and the other two\nH-chains. Moreover, Mellor assumes that all tokens of \\(A, B\\) and\n\\(C\\) are distributed among the four chains so that the number of\nchains is exactly the same, namely one fourth of the sequences. Mellor\nthen defines a causal relation between two singular events \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) in terms of a situation \\(k\\) which makes \\(b\\) more likely to\noccur given \\(a\\) than without \\(a\\), i.e., \\(\\rP(b\\mid a) \\gt\n\\rP(b\\mid {\\sim}a)\\). But we can see that the number of chains in\nwhich \\(b\\) is combined with \\(a\\) is equal to the number of chains in\nwhich \\(b\\) is not combined with \\(a\\). In fact we have that\n\\(\\rP(b\\mid a) =\\) \\(\\rP({\\sim}b\\mid {\\sim}a) =\\) \\(\\rP(b\\mid {\\sim}a)\n=\\) \\(\\rP({\\sim}b\\mid a)\\). From this it follows that a particular\n\\(b\\)\u2019s chance in \\(k\\) cannot increase with respect to \\(a\\)\ncompared to its chance without \\(a\\). Hence \\(a\\) cannot affect \\(b\\),\nand therefore causal loops are impossible.\n\nSome philosophers have not found this argument very convincing. Faye\n(1994) has pointed to the following problematic issues. First, Mellor\nmeasures the probability of singular events (propensities) instead of\nthe probability of certain kinds of events. Second, he does not\ndifferentiate between circumstances in which a \\(B\\) is followed by an\n\\(A\\) and those in which a \\(B\\) is not followed by an \\(A\\). The\nargument is valid only if it can be proved, and not be stipulated,\nthat (1) and (3) happen surrounded by the same facts. Many people\nwould say that in a world of (1) must be different from a world of (3)\nin some other important respects than merely containing \\(a\\) or\n\\({\\sim}a\\), especially since Mellor claims that the argument is valid\nfor deterministic situations as well. Third, the equal distribution of\nthe various chains seems quite selective. In Mellor\u2019s G&H\nworld, in which the number of the four chains is equal, and therefore\nin which the probabilities are equal, there cannot be any causal\nrelationship between the individual \\(b\\) and the individual \\(a\\) due\nto the fact that the occurrence of \\(a\\) or \\({\\sim}a\\) happens under\nexactly the same circumstances given \\(b\\). Finally, fourth, it seems\nappropriate to claim that any negative argument, like Mellor\u2019s,\nshould be able to show that what holds true of one world can be proved\nto hold true of every other world similar in all relevant respects,\nbut in which G-chains and H-chains are not equally distributed.\n\nIt is clear that any world which contains G-chains rather than\nH-chains does not show the same inconsistency as Mellor\u2019s\nG&H-world does. If it can be proved that causal loops in such\nworlds are consistent with the adopted definition, then causal loops\nare possible. In other words, if we set up a consistent model in which\n\\(A\\) increases the probability of \\(B\\), and \\(B\\) increases the\nprobability of \\(A\\), we have then proven that causal loops are\npossible and that Mellor\u2019s argument is invalid. The claim is\ntherefore that both\n\n\\(\\rP(A\\mid B) \\gt \\rP(A\\mid {\\sim}B)\\)\n\\(\\rP(B\\mid A) \\gt \\rP(B\\mid {\\sim}A),\\)\n\n\ncan be shown to be true with respect to a world containing \\(A\\)s and\n\\(B\\)s. Assume the following probabilities, which hold for the\ndistributions among \\(A, {\\sim}A, B\\), and \\({\\sim}B\\), are\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\rP(A \\amp B) &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\rP(A \\amp{\\sim}B) &= 0.1 \\\\\n\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp B) &= 0.1 \\\\\n\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp{\\sim}B) &= 0.1.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nOn the basis of the definition of the conditional probability, we\nget \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\rP(A\\mid B) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp B)}{\\rP(B)} &= 7/8 \\\\\n\\rP(A\\mid {\\sim}B) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp{\\sim}B)}{\\rP({\\sim}B)} &= 1/2 \\\\\n\\rP(B\\mid A) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp B)}{\\rP(A)} &= 7/8; \\\\\n\\rP(B\\mid {\\sim}A) = \\frac{\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp B)}{\\rP({\\sim}A)} &= 1/2. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus (i) and (ii) are both true with respect to the stated world;\nhence we have proven, according to Mellor\u2019s own definition of\ncausality, that it is consistent to talk about causal loops. Mellor\nhas not been able to establish any satisfying a priori\nargument against causal loops or backwards causation.\n\nMoreover, even if one assumes that Mellor were correct in ruling out\ncausal loops a priori, he may be wrong in holding that this\nimpossibility entails the impossibility of time travel as well as\nbackward causation. Mellor\u2019s argument presupposes that it is the\nsame kind of processes obeying the same kind of macroscopic physical\nlaws which enters into both the forward and backward part of the\ncausal loop. This assumption may hold for time travel but not for\nbackward causation.\n3.2 The Consistency Paradoxes\n\nThe consistency paradoxes arise when you, for instance, try to kill\nyour younger self by a backward causal process but evidently have to\nfail. The reason why you must fail is quite obvious. Your younger self\nbelongs to the past and therefore, since you cannot change the past,\nyou cannot commit retro-suicide. This answer tacitly assumes that\nresurrection is impossible. You may, of course, kill your younger self\nin the past without changing the past if you have come alive again\nlater on. This is not what is paradoxical. What is paradoxical is the\nfact that you are assumed to be able to kill your younger self in the\nsense that you are well-equipped to make these kinds of\nretro-killings, you may even be targeting your younger self, but you\nmust always miss. The same holds, indeed, for all those people who\nstay alive into the present. You cannot retro-kill somebody yesterday\nwho is alive today. There must be certain constraints which prohibit\nyou from making retro-suicide or retro-killing, and these constraints\nmay be very local, changing from case to case, or they may be\nuniversal in nature depending on some physical laws. So, on the one\nhand, the assumption is that it physically possible for you to kill\nsomebody in the past; but, on the other hand, it is physically\nimpossible for you to do what is physically possible. This is the\nparadox.\n\nA way out of the paradox was suggested by David Lewis (1976) who\nargued that the ability of killing somebody should be understood as a\npossibility compossible with the relevant fact. As an opera singer,\nfor example, you are able to sing operas, since you have the physical\ncapacity and training to do so, but because of a temporary loss of\nvoice, you cannot hum a single tune. What you can do relative to one\nset of facts, is something you cannot do relative to another set of\nfacts. This contextual solution explains why you are able to\nretro-kill your younger self, given the fact that your gun is in\nproper working-order, you have a good aim at your target, and no one\nforces you to abstain from taking action. But it also explains why you\nare unable to retro-kill anybody who is alive today because you cannot\nchange the past. The consistency paradox exists only in virtue of an\nequivocation of a context-sensitive \u2018can\u2019, and if we\nnotice that, we see that the paradox vanishes like dew before the\nsun.\n\nSome may reply that we are still talking about different abilities. In\ncontrast to the case in which the opera singer sometimes cannot sing,\nyour attempt to carry out retro-suicide inevitably fails. The opera\nsinger is able to sing operas because he has shown it before and can\ndemonstrate it again, but the attempted retro-killer has not proved\nand can never prove his ability. Therefore you are never in a\nsituation where you can kill your younger self. If we accept this\nobjection, we may reformulate the solution by saying that the\ncontextual solution explains why you should be able to retro-kill your\nyounger self under the appropriate circumstances. But, again, how can\nwe talk about the ability to make retro-suicide relative to certain\nfacts at all, if there are no possible worlds in which you carry out\nyour deed. It seems reasonable to say that you have the ability to do\nsomething if there is a possible world in which you carry out this\naction. This is true of the opera singer. He can sing operas because\nhe does it in a possible world in which he has not lost his voice. But\nyou cannot make retro-suicide because there is no possible world in\nwhich you kill your younger self. You are unable, even in principle,\nto do so.\n\nIn sum, the consistency paradox is no paradox as long as you do not\ninsist on changing the past. You are unable to change the past, and\ntherefore you are unable to retro-kill anybody who is alive when you\ntry to kill them. The paradox seems to arise only because you wrongly\nbelieve that you are able to do something you are unable to do.\n\nNow if there is no paradox on the conceptual level, what then is it\nthat makes retro-suicide physically impossible? It could be either\nlocal facts or global facts. Local facts that could constrain your\naction of retro-killing are many. Your hand was shaking while firing\nyour gun, you got a fly in your eye, you were disturbed by a cat, you\njust fainted, etc. These constraining facts seem reasonable by\nthemselves; they could have happened independently of your overall\ncapacity of killing somebody in the past, but also in the actual\nsituation interact with your ability and turn the action into an\nunsuccessful event. The problem is merely that such an explanation\nlooks suspicious. It is a general fact that we cannot retro-kill\nanybody who is alive after the time the death purportedly took place.\nLikewise it is a general fact, assuming that backward causation (or\ntime travel) is physically possible, that we can retro-kill anybody\nwho is not alive after the time the purported death took place. But\nthe explanation of a general fact requires an appeal to a general fact\nor a law of nature. Thus a reference to a singular contingent fact to\nexplain why you never succeed in killing your younger self seems not\nto fulfil the requirement of being an explanation.\n\nThe problem may be better understood in following way: each time you\ntry to retro-kill somebody who is not alive after the time the\npurported effect of killing took place, your assassination may still\nfail because of your hand was shaking, etc. Such particular facts\nexplain why you actually missed the target which you in principle were\nable to hit. But to say that you are in principle able to perform\nretro-killing means that there are laws of nature that normally allow\nyou to perform such an action in the appropriate circumstances.\nSimilarly, each time you try to retro-kill somebody who is alive after\nthe purported death took place, you may fail for one reason or\nanother. But you must always fail to retro-kill somebody who is alive\nafter you did your action, i.e., you are in principle unable to\nretro-kill such a person. In those cases it is physically impossible\nfor you to kill, say, your younger self. It seems, therefore, that\nthere should be some laws of nature, working on either a local level\nor a global level, which violate such an action and makes it\nphysically impossible.\n\nA possible solution may be found in a recent result which shows that\nthe most basic features of quantum mechanics may ensure that we could\nnever alter the past, even if it should be possible to interact with\nthe past. The two physicists, Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil (2005\nin\n Other Internet Resources),\n imagine some form of quantum mechanical feedback by introducing\nfigurative beam splitters which are unitary, i.e., the splitters allow\nthe feedback loop to be reversed because they have the same number of\nentry ports and exit ports. From quantum mechanics we know that an\nobject may behave like a wave and that some unitary operator describes\nthe propagation of a physical system. The system is represented by a\nwave function, also referred to as a path, and the time evolution of\nthe system is calculated as a sum over all possible paths from the\ninitial state to the final state. This calculation is usually\nrestricted to the forward direction of time. Now, if we think of some\nof the paths as unfolding backwards in time, Greenberger and Svozil\nare able to prove that either the forward and the backward component\npaths of the loop cancel out, or that the propagator, which\nestablishes the feedback in time, \u201cwipes out the alternative\npossible futures, thus guaranteeing the future that has already\nhappened\u201d. Thus, if you could aim at something in the past, the\nlaws of nature prohibit you to act in ways that are in conflict with\nwhat makes the future what it is (what it already turned out to be).\nThe authors\u2019 conclusion is that if you go back in time or effect\n\u201cthe past quantum mechanically, you would only see those\nalternatives consistent with the world you left behind you\u201d.\n3.3 The Newcomb Paradox\n\nThis thought experiment involves a player playing a game against a\nfortune teller. In this game there are two boxes of which the player\nmay select one or both. One of the two boxes is transparent,\nlet\u2019s call it \\(A\\), the other is opaque, call it \\(B\\). Before\nthe player makes her choice the fortune teller, based on her\nprediction of the player\u2019s choice, puts a certain amount of\nmoney in one or both boxes. When the player makes her choice, the\nfollowing information is available to her: 1) Up to now the fortune\nteller has been able to predict the future with absolute certainty and\nhas foreseen what other players have chosen. Moreover: 2) sometimes\nthe fortune teller puts 1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\), but only if\nthe player selects box \\(B\\) and does not take both boxes, whereas she\nputs 1,000 dollars in box \\(A\\), regardless of whether the player\nchooses box \\(A\\) or both boxes. So when the player has to choose\nbetween the two boxes, it is already determined whether box \\(B\\)\ncontains 1,000,000 or nothing. If the fortune teller is correct in her\nprediction, the player will get 1,000,000 dollars, only if she selects\nbox \\(B\\); however, if the player wants to earn 1,001,000 dollars and\nselects both boxes, she will miss most of the fortune and only receive\n1,000 dollars, which she can already see in box \\(A\\).\n\nThis puzzle was originally proposed by William Newcomb but never\npublished. After its first publication by Robert Nozick (1969) it was\nmuch discussed within decision theory. But it has also been debated in\nthe context of backward causation, because it gives a nice\nillustration of some of the philosophical problems that arise in\nrelation to backward causation. In this debate it has been used to\ndemonstrate various claims: that backward causation is impossible or\nthat it implies fatalism or determinism. The earliest discussion of\nsome of the consequences for backward causation and free will can be\nfound in George Schlesinger (1974) and in an exchange between Don\nLocke (1978, 1979) and Andr\u00e9 Gallois (1979). Here Schlesinger\nargued that there are good arguments for taking both boxes, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), and equally good arguments for taking only box B, whereas Locke\nheld that backward causation is irrelevant and the player ought to\ntake both boxes. However, Gallois believed that Locke\u2019s\narguments for taking both boxes are misconceived.\n\nTwo opposite arguments for what the player should decide can be given.\nAssuming the player has a free will it seems rational to say that the\nfortune teller cannot in principle predict what the player is going to\ndo. When the player makes her choice, it is already determinate\nwhether box \\(B\\) contains 1,000,000 dollars or nothing. Therefore her\nchoice cannot be affected by the fortune teller\u2019s prediction,\nand she would be better off by selecting both boxes, hoping that there\nalready is 1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\). The other argument\nmaintains that based on previous experience\u2014which tells us that\nthe fortune teller has always been correct about her\npredictions\u2014it would be most rational of the player to take only\n\\(B\\). From here philosophers have disagreed about the strength of the\nargument. One could insist that fortune teller can predict the\nplayer\u2019s choice only based on relevant knowledge of that\nperson\u2019s past or present behavior or state of mind\n(compatibilism). Alternatively one could argue that the fortune teller\ncould have such a perfect knowledge only from information about the\nplayer\u2019s choice in the future.\n\nNevertheless, it has been argued that the Newcomb paradox demonstrates\nthat backward causation is impossible. George Schlesinger (1980:75\nff.), for instance, imagines a perfect judge who is allowed to check\nthe two boxes after the fortune teller has placed the money in the\nboxes, but before the player has made her choice. It is clear that if\nthe perfect judge then informs the player about the content of the two\nboxes, we have a case where the fortune teller\u2019s prediction\ncauses the player to select both boxes as she is informed about the\n1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\). Indeed this would be a clear example\nof Black\u2019s case of bilking. But Schlesinger also argues that the\nsame holds true, if the perfect judge merely knows it without\ninforming the player. However, it is difficult to understand why this\nshould be the conclusion. If we assume that the player has a free will\nand that the fortune teller is able to predict the result of the\nplayer\u2019s choice, it seems most rational for the player to learn\nfrom experience and opt for box \\(B\\) only rather than being greedy\nand take both boxes. As long as the perfect judge is silent, his\nknowledge about the content of the two boxes seems not to be able to\ninfluence the player\u2019s decision. Nor does the player\u2019s\npossible knowledge of the existence of a perfect judge seem to have\nany effect on her decision, because this information does not add\nanything to the information she already has; namely, that the fortune\nteller has placed the money in the boxes before she makes her decision\nand that the fortune teller has never failed to predict the outcome in\nadvance.\n\nAnother problem is that the paradox seems to indicate that backward\ncausation implies fatalism and determinism. If backward causation is\npossible we cannot have a free will. If the result of the\nplayer\u2019s action can be predicted, because it is already true\ntoday what the player will choose tomorrow, she cannot be free to\npick. If the fortune teller already knows that the player will choose\nboth boxes, this has to be true, and the player cannot do otherwise.\nAnd if the fortune teller already knows that the player will select\nonly box \\(B\\), this has to be true, and the player cannot but do it.\nHowever, this argument seems to be misguided.\n\nThe intuitive strength of the argument stems from the general\nassumption that backward causation presupposes an ontologically closed\nfuture\u2014a metaphysical position about time usually named\neternalism. Hence it is not an argument only against backward\ncausation but against eternalism as well. Suppose it is now already\ntrue or false what is going to happen tomorrow; then there must be\nsome future truth-makers that determine that it is now already true or\nfalse what is going to happen. The consequence seems to be that what\nthe player is going to do tomorrow is already determined today; hence\nthe player cannot do otherwise tomorrow than what is true today.\nTherefore the player cannot have a free choice, and it seems futile of\nher to make any decision. \n\nHowever, it can be maintained that the player still has her free\nchoice. Nothing around the fortune teller causes the player to make a\nparticular decision. The player is as free as she would be with no\nprediction. What the fortune teller is able to predict is the result\nof the player\u2019s choice. The choice itself may nevertheless be\nfree. Moreover, unless one replaces forward causation with backward\ncausation, one cannot argue that it is the outcome of the\nplayer\u2019s choice that causes her decision. The statement about\nthe outcome of her decision is true, according to the fortune teller,\nbecause of the particular decision the player makes; a statement about\nthe player\u2019s decision is not true because of the outcome of her\ndecision. Consequently, even with respect to the fortune teller, the\nplayer\u2019s decision may be regarded as free in the sense that\nnothing in its past nor in its future determines what the decision\nactually becomes. The reason why the fortune teller is able to make\nher prediction could be that the player\u2019s choice instigates an\ninformation channel backwards in time.\n\nPhilosophers who reject eternalism may not leave the discussion here.\nThey could argue that it may very well be the case that the\nplayer\u2019s choice is neither causally determined by past events\nnor by future events. Yet, eternalism implies that the player\u2019s\ndecision is ontologically determinate before it is made, since it is\ntrue today what she will decide tomorrow. Therefore she is not as free\nas she would be if the future is ontologically open, i.e., it is not\nyet ontologically determinate what the future is going to be,\nincluding the player\u2019s choice. The eternalist may attempt to\nrebut these critics by arguing that as long as the player\u2019s\ndecision is not causally determined, it is free in any possible sense.\n\n4. Physics\n\nThe notion of backward causation raises a very different set of\nquestions that need to be answered before a physically adequate notion\nhas been developed.\n\n What, if anything, would in physical terms characterize\nbackward causation? \n\n\nOne has to remember that causality as such is an everyday notion that\nhas no natural application in physics. How we could physically\nidentify backward causal processes depends very much on which feature\nwe take our ordinary notion of causation to apply to a physical\nprocess. In physics we may be tempted to associate it with different\nphysical notions of processes. Four suggestions have been put forward:\n(a) the causal link can be identified with the transference of energy;\n(b) it can be identified with the conservation of physical quantities\nlike charge, linear and angular momentum; (c) it can be identified\nwith interaction of forces; or (d) it can be identified with the\nmicroscopic notion of interaction. It appears with respect to all four\nsuggestions, however, that the involved descriptions are invariant\nunder the time reversal operation.\n\nThe most fundamental laws of nature are time reversal invariant in the\nsense that our physical theories allow description of the fundamental\nreactions and processes in terms of the time reversed order. Such\nprocesses are said to be reversible in time. Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism, for instance, admits two kinds of mathematical\nsolutions for the equations describing the radiation of energy in an\nelectromagnetic field. One is called the retarded solution\nwhere radiation appears as outgoing concentric waves, the other is\nnamed the advanced solution according to which radiation\nappears as incoming concentric waves. \u00a0 Apparently the advanced\nsolution describes the temporal inverse phenomena of the retarded\nsolution so that these two solutions are usually regarded as the time\nreverse solution of the other. Nevertheless, retarded waves, like the\nincrease of entropy in quasi-closed systems, appear to be de\nfacto irreversible although they are described in terms of time\ninvariant laws. Nature seems to prefer certain processes rather than\ntheir temporally inversed counterparts in spite of the fact that the\nlaws of nature do not show such a preference. Light, radiation and\nripples on a pond always spread outwards from their source rather than\ninwards just like entropy of a quasi-closed system is always moving\nfrom lower to higher states.\n4.1 The Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory\n\nWhy do we not see any advanced waves in nature? Wheeler and Feynman\n(1945) came up with an answer. If we assume, they said, that radiation\nfrom an isolated accelerated charged particle is equally retarded and\nadvanced, that is half retarded and half advanced to be exact, we can\nexplain why it appears to be fully retarded in terms of the influence\ndistant absorbers make on the source. The absorber consists of charged\nmaterial that reacts with the source field by radiating with half\nretarded and half advanced waves. It is this half advanced field of\nthe charged particles of the absorber which is added to the half\nretarded field of the source. The advanced waves of the absorber\ninterfere constructively with the retarded waves of the source,\nwhereas the same waves cancel out the advanced waves of the source in\na destructive interference. Thus one of the consequences of Wheeler\nand Feynman Absorber Theory is the idea that emitters are\nintrinsically symmetric, another is that there is no intrinsic\ndifference between so-called emitters and so-called absorbers. In\nother words, if this theory is true we have to conclude that radiation\nfrom a source is a time symmetric process but the presence of an\nabsorber makes it asymmetric.\n\nThe Wheeler-Feynman theory takes for granted that outgoing, expanding\nwaves are identical with retarded radiation and incoming, contracting\nwaves with advanced radiation. But is such identification without any\nproblems? Not quite. An example with retarded and advanced emitters\nillustrates clearly why. Think of a stone being thrown directly into\nthe middle of a circular pond. The ripples move outwards from the\npoint where the stone hits the water (the source) in a coherent,\norganized wave front and eventually reach the edges (the absorber).\nMoreover, the source acts earlier than the absorber.\u00a0 What will\nthe inverse process look like? It depends on how we understand such a\nprocess, whether or not we consider a case that includes a reversed\nsource and a reversed absorber. (A) If they are included, the edges of\nthe pond will now act as the source and the converging waves will\neventually reach the middle of the pond. We may create something like\nthis if we dropped a big ring horizontally into the pond. Inside the\nring the waves would move inwards in an organized wave front towards\nthe centre. \u00a0 In this case the source (the drop of the ring)\nwould still act earlier than the absorber (the ripples meeting at the\nmiddle of the pond from all sides). (B) But if our understanding of\nthe inverse process does not include an exchange of the source with\nthe absorber and vice versa, then the ripples reach the edges\nof the pond (the absorber) earlier than the stone plunges into the\nwater (the source). This is definitely not a state of affairs we could\nbring about. Furthermore, if we were to observe such a process, the\nripples would seem to move inwards as contracting waves. The problem\nis that both kinds of inverse processes would seem to appear to us as\norganized incoming waves but one would be a case of retarded radiation\nand the other of advanced radiation.\n\nThis may not be the only problematic assumption of the Wheeler and\nFeynman theory. Huw Price (1996) has singled out other problems. Among\nthem is the question of how we may experience the difference between\nretarded and advanced waves. When Wheeler and Feynman attributed to\nthe source a field of half retarded and half advanced waves, they\nassumed that the field actually consists of retarded as well as an\nadvanced component. Price objects, however, that there is no\nmeasurable difference between the two kinds of waves, and we cannot\njustify such a distinction by an appeal to the nature of the source\nbecause both emitters and absorbers can be associated with retarded as\nwell as advanced waves. Instead he believes that these components are\nfictitious and that Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s formalism merely offer\ntwo different descriptions of the same wave. The problem of the\nasymmetry, as he sees it, has nothing to do with the fact that\ntransmitters are associated with outgoing radiation rather than\nincoming radiation but that transmitters are centered on organized\noutgoing wave fronts whereas receivers are not centered on similar\norganized incoming wave fronts.\n4.2 Tachyons\n\nWhen the discussion of tachyons began to appear in physics in the\n1960s, it was soon noticed that such particles according to some\nframes of reference were associated with negative energies going\nbackwards in time. To understand how, consider the trajectory of the\nsame tachyon in relation of three different reference frames, \\(S,\nS^*\\), and \\(S^{**}\\) in the Minkowski-space. Now assume that \\(A\\)\nis, in relation to \\(S\\), the emission of a tachyon at \\(t_{1}\\) and\n\\(B\\) is the absorption of the tachyon at \\(t_{2}\\). According to an\nobserver in \\(S, A\\) will be earlier than \\(B\\) and the tachyon will\ncarry positive energy forward in time. Nevertheless it is always\npossible to select a reference frame \\(S^*\\) in relation to which an\nobserver will see \\(A\\) happen simultaneously with \\(B\\) and yet\nanother reference frame \\(S^{**}\\) in relation to which an observer\nsees \\(A\\) happens at \\(t_{2}^{**}\\) whereas \\(B\\) happens at\n\\(t_{1}^{**}\\). According to the observer in \\(S^{*}\\), \\(A\\) will\ntake place later than \\(B\\) and the tachyon carries negative energy\nbackwards in time (See Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Spacetime diagram of\ntachyon\n\n\nIn Figure 1 the planes represent the hypersurfaces of simultaneity. In\nrelation to frame \\(S\\) the tachyon source is at rest, and a tachyon\nis emitted at event \\(A\\), with a superluminal but finite velocity.\nThe absorption of the tachyon, event \\(B\\), will accordingly occur\nlater than \\(A\\) in relation to the observer in \\(S\\), and the arrow\nof trajectory is for that reason pointing into the future above the\nhypersurface passing through \\(A\\) and standing perpendicular to the\nworld-line of the source. But neither with respect to the frame\n\\(S^*\\) nor \\(S^{**}\\) is the tachyon source at rest and the\nhypersurfaces are therefore tilted in relation to the arrow of\ntrajectory. An observer in \\(S^*\\) observes the tachyon to have\ninfinite speed, and therefore the hypersurface is tilted so much that\nit coincides with the arrow. The observer in \\(S^{**}\\) is moving so\nfast with respect to the tachyon source that the hypersurface becomes\ntitled so much that the arrow points into the past below the\nhypersurface.\n\nE. Recami (1978) tried to avoid the idea that tachyons could move\nbackwards in time by introducing the so-called reinterpretation\nprinciple according to which all negative energy tachyons should be\ninterpreted as if they have positive energy and move forward in time.\nThis would mean that the causal order of tachyons should not be\nregarded objective since both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) sometimes denoted the\nemission and sometimes the absorption depending on the frame of\nreference. There are, however, good reasons to believe that this\nsuggestion does not solve the problems it was intended to (Faye\n1981/1989).\n4.3 Quantum Mechanics\n\nOther physical candidates for backward causation can be founded in the\nphysics literature. Richard Feynman once came up with the idea that\nthe electron could go backwards in time as a possible interpretation\nof the positron (Feynman 1949). In fact he imagined the possibility\nthat perhaps there were only one electron in the world zig-zagging back\nand forth in time. An electron moving backwards in time would carry\nnegative energy whereas it would with respect to our ordinary time\nsense have positive charge and positive energy. But few consider this\nas a viable interpretation today (Earman 1967a, 1976).\n\nMore recently, the Bell type experiments have been interpreted by some\nas if quantum events could be connected in such a way that the past\nlight cone might be accessible under non-local interaction; not only\nin the sense of action at a distance but as backward causation. One of\nthe most enticing experiments of this kind is the Delayed Choice\nQuantum Eraser designed by Yoon-Ho Kim et al. (2000). It is a\nrather complicated construction. It is set up to measure correlated\npairs of photons, which are in an entangled state, so that one of the\ntwo photons is detected 8 nanoseconds before its partner. The results\nof the experiment are quite amazing. They seem to indicate that the\nbehavior of the photons detected these 8 nanoseconds before their\npartners is determined by how the partners will be detected. Indeed it\nmight be tempting to interpret these results as an example of the\nfuture causing the past. The result is, however, in accordance with\nthe predictions of quantum mechanics.\n\nHowever, David Ellerman (2015) argues that interpreting delayed-choice\nexperiments or similar experiments as revealing cases of backward\ncausation or retrocausation relies on what he calls the separation\nfallacy:\n\nWe have seen the same fallacy of interpretation in two-slit\nexperiments, which-way interferometer experiments, polarization\nanalyzers, and Stern-Gerlach experiments. The common element in all\nthe cases is that there is some separation apparatus that puts a\nparticle into a certain superposition of spatially\n\u201centangled\u201d or correlated eigenstates in such a manner\nthat when an appropriately spatially-positioned detector induces a\ncollapse to an eigenstate, then the detector will only register one of\nthe eigenstates. The separation fallacy is that this is misinterpreted\nas showing that the particle was already in that eigenstate in that\nposition as a result of the previous \u201cseparation.\u201d In fact\nthe superposition evolves until some distinction is made that\nconstitutes a measurement, and only then is the state reduced to an\neigenstate. The quantum erasers are more elaborate versions of these\nsimpler experiments, and a similar separation fallacy arises in that\ncontext.\n\n\nThus, Ellerman argues that when one describes a system in a\nsuperposition of certain eigenstates, it does not mean that the system\nis in any of these eigenstates before some measurement is carried out.\nTherefore, it is wrong to interpret delayed-choice experiments, and\ntheir like, as if the future measurement determines some past\neigenstates, which all were parts of a superposition.\n\nIn his discussion of the experimental violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities\nDon Howard (1989) distinguishes, based on an earlier work done by Jon\nJarrett, between locality and separability. The locality condition\nstates that a measurement of a pair of objects emerging from a singlet\nis statistically independent of the setting of the apparatus used to\nmeasure its counterpart. However, the separability condition is\ndefined as the joint probability is equal to the the product of the\nprobability of each state. We know that the experimental violation of\nBell\u2019s inequalities involves the invalidation of one of these\nconditions. Moreover, if we take Ellerman\u2019s argument into\nconsideration, the two entangled particles, although separated, are\nstill in a state of superposition until the measurement takes\nplace.\n\nIf we consider the notion of the entangled state in quantum mechanics,\nwe find that it is characterized as a unified, non-separable state due\nto the help of the notion of superposition of possible eigenstates\nrepresented by one common wave function for the correlated pair. Such\na superposition is neither distance-dependent nor time-dependent.\nTherefore it is not surprising that based on the correct predictions\nof quantum mechanics it is impossible to find support of the violation\nof normal causation within this kind of experiment. With reference to\nthe philosophical discussion about quantum mechanical entanglement, we\ncan conclude that the experimental results of this sort violate the\nprinciple of separability rather than the principle of locality.\n\nPhillippe Eberhard and Ronald R. Roos (1989) have established a\ntheorem which says that if quantum mechanics is correct, it is\nimpossible to use quantum effects to generate a break in the chain of\nnormal causation. Quantum field theory does not allow any superluminal\ncommunication between different observers. Indeed, this is not so\nstrange, since quantum field theory is relativistically invariant\nwhereas superluminal frames of reference are not. But Eberhard and\nRoos\u2019 theorem does not rule out all forms of backward causation.\nTwo possible scenarios are still open: (1) entangled pairs exchange\nsome form of superluminal information (and energy) below the limits of\nHeisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relations; or (2) causation may be\nsymmetrical so that the direction of causation in a physical system is\ndetermined by its boundary conditions.\n\nCosta de Beauregard (1977, 1979), for instance, has suggested that\nwhen a system of two photons in a singlet state is measured by two\nobservers in two regions separated by a space-like distance, then it\nis precisely the act of observation that produces the past of the\nmeasuring process in the sense that it influences the source that\nemitted the two photons. de Beauregard\u2019s idea is that the\nelement of reality being revealed in the formulation of the EPR\nparadox is real only because it was created by actually performed acts\nof observation that was propagated backwards in time with one of the\ntwo correlated quantum objects from the measuring device to the source\nof the photons.\n\nSome physicists, like Elitzur et al. (2016), suggest a form\nof too-late-choice experiment that supports such a time-symmetric\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics according to which backwards\ncausation plays a significant role. In the normal EPR experiment, each\nmeasurement determines, say, the spin value of two separated, say,\nelectrons in a singlet state along a certain orientation of the\napparatus. The outcome then proves that the spin value of one electron\nhas been affected by the distant experimenter\u2019s choice of spin\norientation of the other electron. However, what Elitzur et\nal. now imagine is a reversal setting in which a chosen spin\nvalue determines the corresponding orientation. Based on their\nanalysis, they conclude that \u201cit turns out that the orientation is\nsimilarly subject to nonlocal effects [as the spin value.]\u201d\n\nSeveral other philosophers and physicists have come forward with\nsimilar ideas. Aharonov and Vaidman (1997) have formulated a two\nvector approach to quantum mechanics \u201cin which a quantum system is\ndescribed, at a given time, by two (instead of one) quantum states:\nthe usual one evolving toward the future and the second evolving\nbackwards in time from a future measurement.\u201d Also Cramer\u2019s\ntransactional interpretation of quantum mechanics involves the idea of\na second wave travelling backwards in time (Cramer, 1986). The basic\nassumption behind all of them is that in the micro-world we find only\ncausal symmetry, and this fact together with proper boundary\nconditions can be used to give an explanation of outcomes that seem\notherwise paradoxical. Such quantum correlation experiments can,\nhowever, be interpreted in many other ways. In the end it seems as if\nit all depends one whether one assumes that Bell experiments break\nwith either the locality condition or the separability condition. A\ntime-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics is required only if\none believes that it is the locality condition that is violated in\norder to avoid being in conflict with relativity theory.\n4.4 Two alternatives\n\nThese alleged examples of backward causation have one thing in common.\nThey are all based on the idea that fundamental physical processes are\nby themselves symmetric in nature. Our ordinary notion of causation\ndoes not track any nomological feature of the world. What counts as\nthe cause and the effect depends on the observer\u2019s projection of\nhis or her temporal sense onto the world. So it is still an open\nquestion how a coherent notion of backward causation can fit into this\ngeneral understanding of nature. The question we therefore have to\nanswer is the following:\n\n How can we distinguish between forward causation and backward\ncausation if all basic physical processes are time symmetric according\nto our description of nature? \n\n\nTwo very different reactions to this problem seem possible.\n4.4.1 Boundary Conditions\n\nOne proposal is to say that if we came across reversed cases of de\nfacto irreversible processes, such as running a film backwards in\nwhich the cream converged in a coffee cup, such cases should be\ninterpreted as examples of backward causation (Price 1996). Such a\nclaim build on a common interpretation of time reversal invariance of\nprocesses according to which this descriptive feature of the dynamical\nequations of physics makes reversal processes symmetric in time. Many\nphilosophers have defended such an interpretation, in particular Hans\nReichenbach (1956, 1929 [1958]) and Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum (1963). This\nalso led them to argued that only de facto irreversible\nprocesses, such as those described by statistical thermodynamics,\ncould be used to defined a physical orientation of time. Thus, it\nseems to be the case that the actual world consisting of mostly de\nfacto irreversible processes on the macroscopic level due to a\nprevalent set of boundary conditions is temporally and causally\nsymmetric on the microscopic level. On the macroscopic level, de\nfacto irreversible processes emerge, because the boundary\nconditions are a result of the huge degree of freedom among\nmicroprocesses or coherence conditions forced upon the underlying\nmicroscopic processes.\n\nThe point is here to argue that it is the absence of the right initial\nor boundary conditions on the macroscopic level that makes backward\ncausation so rare or nearly empirically impossible. This suggestion is\nbased on three basic assumptions: (i) there is no objective asymmetry\nin the world, causal processes are intrinsically symmetric in nature,\nor causation is bidirectional, and therefore the fundamental processes\nof the micro-world are temporally symmetric; (ii) causal asymmetry is\nsubjective in the sense that any attribution of an asymmetry between\ncause and effect depends on our use of counterfactuals and our own\ntemporal orientation; (iii) backward causation, or advanced action, is\nnonetheless possible because sometimes the correlation of certain past\nevents depends on the existence of causally symmetric processes and\nsome future boundary conditions. For instance, advanced actions in\nelectrodynamics require that the existence of transmitters in the\nfuture are centered on organized incoming wave fronts; and advanced\nactions in quantum mechanics require that their present states are in\npart determined by the future conditions (measurements) they are to\nencounter. This feature is then taken to explain quantum entanglement\nand the violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities in quantum\nmechanics.\n\nA simple consideration seems to support this interpretation. Think of\na particle travelling between two boxes. The normal observer and the\ncounter-observer who has an inverse time sense will describe the\nexchange in conflicting terms. To the normal observer Box 1, say, will\nbe considered as the emitter because it loses energy before anything\nin Box 2 happens. Therefore, Box 2 will be considered as the receiver\nsince it gains energy at a later time. So in relation to the normal\nobserver, the particle travels from Box 1 to Box 2. The\ncounter-observer, however, sees the situation with opposite eyes. In\nrelation to him, Box 2 loses energy and not until thereafter does Box\n1 gain a similar amount of energy. Accordingly, in relation to the\ncounter-observer, the particle moves from Box 2 to Box 1. In other\nwords whether a box is considered to be an emitter or a receiver\ndepends on the observer\u2019s time sense.\n4.4.2 Nomic conditions\n\nThe other proposal denies that basic physical processes are time\nsymmetric and argues, in contrast, that the causal asymmetry is\nobjective and therefore that there exists an intrinsic difference\nbetween the cause and the effect of all physical processes. John\nEarman (1967b and 1969) may be the first who argued against the\ninterpretation that time reversal invariance of processes is identical\nwith invariance under the exchange of the temporal order between\nearlier and later. Two reversed tokens of the same\ntype of physical process do not developed in the opposite direction of\ntime.\n\nHence, backward causation should not be considered as a notion about\nboundary conditions but as a notion concerned with processes that\nnomically distinguish themselves from forward causal processes. Thus,\nif there are processes in the world that might be seen as a\nmanifestation of backward causation, these are not to be depicted by a\ndescription that leaves them to be time reversed cases of ordinary\nforward causal processes (Faye 1981/1989, 1997, 2002). This\nalternative interpretation rests on a basic claim and four\nassumptions.\n\nThe fundamental claim is that for any observer it is possible to\nidentify experimentally the cause and the effect so that these remain\nthe same even in relation to counter-observers, i.e., observers having\nthe opposite time sense of ours. In support of this claim consider the\nfollowing thought experiment. Two boxes, each having a shutter, are\nfacing each other. Assume, ex hypothesis, that Box 1 is the particle\nsource and Box 2 is the particle receiver. The question is how a\nnormal observer and a counter-observer can come to agreement that\nparticles move from Box 1 to Box 2. The answer can be found through a\nseries of manipulations with the shutters, I would say. There are four\npossible combinations of the two shutters: open-open, close-close,\nopen-close, close-open. Let us call any change of energy in Box 1,\nregardless of whether it emits or receives a particle, \\(A\\) and,\nsimilarly, any change of energy in Box \\(2 B\\). Whether \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nstand for a gain or a loss of energy can be determined by weighing the\ntwo boxes. (i) In case both boxes are closed, no particle will leave\nBox 1 and no particle is received by Box 2, thus no gain or loss of\nenergy occurs, and both the normal observer and the counter-observer\nsee a situation of not-\\(A\\), not-\\(B\\). (ii) In case both boxes are\nopen a particle leaves Box 1 and is received by Box 2. Again this can\nbe observed by measuring the change of energy in the two boxes. Thus\nthe observers will see a situation of both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). (iii) In\ncase Box 1 is closed and Box 2 is open, they will observe no change of\nenergy in Box 1 (because it is closed) and, since no particle is\nleaving Box 1, no particle will reach Box 2 although its shutter is\nopen. Hence the observers measure no energy change in this box. Thus\nthey see not-\\(A\\) and not-\\(B\\). (iv) Finally, if Box 1 is open and\nBox 2 is closed, a particle leaves Box 1, but none is received by Box\n2. In other words, there is a loss or a gain of energy in Box 1, but\nno loss or gain of energy in Box 2. So the observers see \\(A\\) and\nnot-\\(B\\). The upshot of this toy experiment is that the normal\nobserver as well as the counter-observer experience two \\(A\\)s but\nonly one \\(B\\), and one not-\\(A\\) but two not-\\(B\\)s; therefore both\nwill agree that the particles move from Box 1 to Box 2.\n\nThis means that what a normal observer identifies as a forward causal\nprocess will be regarded as a backward causal process in relation to\nthe counter-observer in the sense that the very same event acting as a\npast cause for the normal observer will act as a future cause for the\ncounter-observer. This indicates, too, that in relation to a normal\nobserver forward causation and backward causation cannot be regarded\nas two different manifestations of nomologically reversible (but\nde facto irreversible) processes since both\nmanifestations\u2014the common process and the very improbable\nreversed process\u2014would develop forward in time. If this claim is\ntrue, it implies that the description of physical processes should\nreflect such an intrinsic asymmetry in a way that the nomic\ndescription varies according to whether the process in question goes\nforward or backwards in time. Moreover, we must also be able to\ndistinguish theoretically (and not only experimentally) between the\nnormal observer\u2019s report and the counter-observer\u2019s report\nof the same process by a separate convention in respect to whether the\nprocess is forward moving or backward moving. What we want is a\ncharacterization of every physical process so that the invariance of\ncause and effect corresponds to nomological\nirreversibility.\n\nIn order to establish a nomic, intrinsic distinction between forward\ncausal processes and backward causal processes one has to take\ndeparture in four assumptions. (i) Process tokens and process\ntypes are distinct in the sense that only process types are\nreversible, process tokens are not. (ii) A normal observer will\ndescribe causal processes propagating forward in time in terms of\npositive mass and positive energy states pointing into her future\nwhereas she will describe the same tokens in terms of negative\nmass and energy states pointing into her past. This reflects two\npossible solutions of the four-momentum vector in the theory of\nrelativity. (iii)Thus, one must distinguish between a passive\ntime reversal operation and an active time reversal\noperation. The passive transformation is applied to the same process\ntoken by describing it in terms of opposite coordinates and\nopposite energy states. The active transformation, in contrast, brings\nabout another token of the same process type in virtue of some\nphysical translation or rotation of the system itself, both tokens\nhaving the same energy sign pointing in the same direction of time.\n(iv) The description in terms of positive mass and the positive\nenergy flow corresponds to the intrinsic order of the propagation.\n\nNow, let us try to apply the nomic interpretation to the above\nconsideration concerning the exchange of a particle between two boxes.\nIn relation to the normal observer who describes the particle in terms\nof its positive energy component, it travels from Box 1 to\nBox 2 because Box 1 looses energy at an earlier time and Box 2 gains\nenergy at a later time. The same situation is by the counter-observer\ndescribed in terms of the particle\u2019s negative energy\ncomponent as a situation where something happens in Box 2 before\nit happens in Box 1. In relation to the counter-observer, Box 2 would\nnot, as the boundary interpretation suggests, loose energy. On the\ncontrary, Box 2 would seem to gain energy, but the counter-observer\nwould describe the particle as a series of negative energy states\nreaching into his future supposing the particle to be moving from Box\n2 to Box 1 carrying negative energy. But, as we have just argued, the\nparticle really moves from Box 1 to Box 2, from the\ncounter-observer\u2019s future into his past carrying positive\nenergy.\n\nConsequently, the nomic interpretation holds that in relation to our\nnormal time sense the causal direction of ordinary processes is\nidentical with that of their reversed processes. In other words, take\ntwo tokens of a nomologically reversible process type, say \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), and let \\(B\\) be the actively time reversed process of \\(A\\),\nthen this interpretation claims that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) causally develop\nin the same direction of time. So, according to this view, neither\nincoming, contracting electromagnetic waves nor the decrease of\nentropy would count as examples of backward causation as long as such\nprocesses involve ordinary types of matter, i.e., matter that\npossesses positive mass and/or energy pointing, in relation to our\nnormal time sense, towards the future. The notion of backward\ncausation should instead be applied to matter of a different type,\nparticles that appear to have, according to usual conventions,\nnegative mass and/or energy pointing, in relation to our normal\ntime sense, towards the future but positive mass and/or energy\npointing towards the past. Such advanced matter, if it exists,\nshould be distinguished from both ordinary retarded matter as well as\ntachyons by always being described with respect to our time sense in\nterms of negative mass and energy stretching forward in time. A\nconsequence is that a world in which advanced matter exists together\nwith retarded matter, and where advanced matter is able to interact\ndirectly with the same amount of retarded matter, both would, in case\nthey actually did interact, annihilate without leaving any trace of\nenergy.\n\nHow and whether the notion of backward causation has a role to play in\nphysics has yet to be seen. But as long as no common agreement exists\namong philosophers and physicists about what in the physical\ndescription of the world corresponds to our everyday notion of\ncausation, it would still be a matter of theoretical dispute what\ncounts as empirical examples of backward causation.",
