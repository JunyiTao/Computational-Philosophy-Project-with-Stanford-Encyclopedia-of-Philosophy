For\nexample, terms such as cheerful, exuberant, and depressed\nmay be\nconsidered semantically similar to the extent that they tend to occur\nflanked by the same (or in turn similar) nearby words. (For some\npurposes, such as information retrieval, identifying labels of\ndocuments may be used as occurrence contexts.) Through careful\ndistinctions among various occurrence contexts, it  may also be\npossible to factor similarity into more specific relations such as\nsynonymy, entailment, and antonymy. One basic difference between\n(standard) logical semantic relations and relations based on\ndistributional similarity is that the latter are a matter of degree.\nFurther, the underlying abstractions are very different, in that\nstatistical semantics does not relate strings to the world, but only to\ntheir contexts of occurrence (a notion similar to, but narrower than,\nWittgenstein's notion of meaning as use). However, statistical\nsemantics does admit elegant formalizations. Various concepts of\nsimilarity and other semantic relations can be captured in terms of\nvector algebra, by viewing the occurrence frequencies of an expression\nas values of the components of a vector, with the components\ncorresponding to the distinct contexts of occurrence. In this way, one\narrives at a notion of semantics based on metrics and operators in\nvector spaces, where vector operators can mimic Boolean operators in\nvarious ways (G\u00e4rdenfors 2000; Widdows 2004; Clarke 2012).\nBut how does this bear on meaning representation of natural language\nsentences and texts? In essence, the representation  of sentences\nin statistical semantics consists of the sentences themselves. The idea\nthat sentences can be used directly, in conjunction with distributional\nknowledge, as objects enabling inference is a rather recent and\nsurprising one, though it was foreshadowed by many years of work on\nquestion answering based on large text corpora. The idea has gained\ntraction as a result of recent efforts to devise statistically based\nalgorithms for determining textual\nentailment, a program pushed forward\nby a series of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges\ninitiated in 2005, organized by the PASCAL Network of Excellence, and\nmore recently by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST). Recognizing textual entailment requires judgments as to whether\none given linguistic string entails a second one, in a sense of\nentailment that accords with human intuitions about what a person would\nnaturally infer (with reliance on knowledge about word meanings,\ngeneral knowledge such as that any person who works for a branch of a\ncompany also works for that company, and occasional well-known specific\nfacts). For example, \n\u201cJohn is a fluent French speaker\u201d textually\nentails \n\u201cJohn speaks French\u201d,\nwhile \n\u201cThe gastronomic capital of France is Lyon\u201d does not entail that \n\u201cThe capital of France is Lyon\u201d. Some\nexamples are intermediate; e.g.,\n\n\u201cJohn was born in France\u201d is\nconsidered to heighten the probability that John speaks French, without\nfully entailing it (Glickman and Dagan 2005). Initial results in the\nannual competitions were poor (not far above the random guessing mark),\nbut have steadily improved, particularly with the injection of some\nreasoning based on ontologies and on some general axioms about the\nmeanings of words, word classes,  relations, and phrasal patterns\n(e.g., de Salvo Braz et al. 2005).\nIt is noteworthy that the conception of sentences as meaning\nrepresentations echoes Montague's contention that language is logic. Of\ncourse, Montague understood \u201csentences\u201d as unambiguous syntactic trees.\nBut research in textual entailment seems to be moving towards a similar\nconception, as exemplified in the work of Dagan et al. (2008),\nwhere statistical entailment relations are based on syntactic trees,\nand these are generalized to templates that may replace subtrees by\ntyped variables. Also Clarke (2012) proposes a very general\nvector-algebraic framework for statistical semantics, where \u201ccontexts\u201d\nfor sentences might include (multiple) parses and even (multiple)\nlogical forms for the sentences, and where statistical sentence\nmeanings can be built up compositionally from their proper parts. One\nway of construing degrees of entailment in this framework is in terms\nof the entailment probabilities relating each possible logical form of\nthe premise sentence to each possible logical form of the hypothesis in\nquestion.\n",
