    "main_text": "Luther and Early Modern Philosophy\n1. Luther and Early Modern Philosophy\n\nAt a general level, in this period Luther\u2019s ideas had a role in\nshaping two key philosophical disputes of a broadly epistemological\nkind, one concerning the relation between philosophy and theology as\ndisciplines, and the other concerning the possibility of religious\ncertainty. The first can be illustrated by the so-called\n\u201cHofmann-streit\u201d (or \u201cHofmann Controversy\u201d)\nwhich took place at the University of Helmstedt in 1598, in which\nDaniel Hofmann (1538\u20131621) cited Luther to attack his\nphilosophical colleagues, which brought a response from the Scottish\nmathematician and physician Duncan Liddel (1561\u20131613) amongst\nothers (for further discussion, see Antognazza 1996 and Hunter 2006;\nfor the link to Liddel, see Regier 2016). Throughout the seventeenth\ncentury, the controversy had a major impact on the debate between\ntheology and philosophy and, in particular, on discussions surrounding\nthe so-called doctrine of double truth (see\n Luther entry \u00a72).\n Pierre Bayle (1647\u20131706) devoted an article of his\nDictionaire historique et critique to the controversy, and\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) discussed it repeatedly,\nincluding in the Nouveaux Essais and in the\nTheodicy.\n\nA second epistemological issue was also raised by Luther\u2019s\nclaims for the priority of scripture over ecclesiastical authority,\nwhich Luther had argued (for example in The Bondage of the\nWill against Erasmus; see WA 18:603\u201314/LW 33:19\u201336)\nwould make possible a certainty that such authority lacked\u2014but\nwhich as a method had itself proved problematic in settling disputes\nbetween Luther and those who challenged his scriptural interpretations\n(see\n Luther entry \u00a72).\n As Richard Popkin (1979) has argued, this impasse led to significant\ndebates between subsequent Reformers and Catholics concerning which\napproach, if any, could avoid scepticism, or indeed if faith required\naccommodation with scepticism in some form (which Luther himself had\nvehemently denied against Erasmus: see\n Luther entry \u00a74).\n\nAs well as providing an important context for these general debates,\nat a more individual level another prominent early modern philosopher\nwho responded to Luther\u2019s thought was not only Leibniz, but also\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679), where one concern that is central to\nboth is the question of free will, but other issues are also relevant.\nThis influence will now be considered in more detail, beginning with\nHobbes and then turning to Leibniz.\n\nWhile generally expressing admiration for Luther\u2019s role in the\nReformation against what Hobbes saw as the evils of the Catholic\n Church,[4]\n the most direct use Hobbes makes of Lutheran ideas is in his\ncontroversy with John Bramhall, Bishop of Derry, over the issue of\nfree will. The two men were led into debate by the Marquess of\nNewcastle when the three were in exile in Paris in 1645, but following\nthe unauthorized publication of Hobbes\u2019s contribution in 1654 as\nOn Liberty and Necessity, Bramhall himself published his own\nearlier strongly-worded contribution as A Defence of True Liberty\nfrom Antecedent and Extrinsical Necessity in the following year,\nto which Hobbes then replied in similarly strident terms, in his\nQuestions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance of 1656,\nto which Bramhall published a further response in 1658:\nCastigations of Mr Hobbes His Last Animadversions in the Case\nConcerning Liberty, and Universal\n Necessity.[5]\n\nBramhall makes his objections to Hobbes abundantly clear in the\nfollowing passage from his Defence of True Liberty:\n\n\nI hate this Doctrin from my heart and I believe both I have reason so\nto do, and all others who shall seriously ponder the horrid\nconsequences which flow from it. It destroyes liberty, and dishonours\nthe nature of man. It makes the second causes and outward objects to\nbe the Rackets, and Men to be but the Tennis-Balls of destiny. It\nmakes the first cause, that is, God Almighty, to be the introducer of\nall evill, and sin into the world, as much as Man, yea more than Man,\nby as much as the motion of the Watch is more from the Artificer, who\ndid make it and wind it up, than either from the springs, or the\nwheels, or the thred, if God by his special influence into the second\ncauses, did necessitate them to operate as they did. (Bramhall 1655:\n60) \n\n\nBramhall\u2019s central concern was thus two-fold: first,\nHobbes\u2019s determinism \u201cdishonours the nature of man\u201d\nby making him into nothing more than a \u201cTennis-Ball of\ndestiny\u201d, while secondly it creates theological difficulties by\nentailing that God is as much the author of evil and sin as of good, a\nconclusion so abhorrent that if taken seriously, it could not but push\nright thinking people into atheism.\n\nFaced with this challenge, and fully accepting that his position\ntreated God as a first cause from which all else happens with\nnecessity, Hobbes appealed in his defence to the Reformation tradition\nin general, and Luther in particular, thus fighting a theological\ncritic with theological authorities. As we have seen from the\ndiscussion of The Bondage of the Will\n (Luther entry \u00a74),\n Luther had faced similar forms of criticism from Erasmus, and so\nHobbes was able to make use of some of Luther\u2019s replies to\nErasmus in responding to Bramhall. In particular, he employed\nLuther\u2019s distinction between the necessity of immutability and\nthe necessity of constraint to argued that while human beings lack\nfree will, they are nonetheless not forced to sin against\ntheir will, and so can still have sin imputed to them (Hobbes 1656:\n\u00a719(a), 1841: 259\u201360, 1999: 77\u20138; 1656: \u00a720 (n),\n1841: 298, 1999: 79\u201380; see also WA 18:616 note/LW 33:39). And\nin response to the question that if God has power over us and so can\ndetermine our will, why he does not just use this power to make us\ngood, but instead punishes us when we are not, Hobbes makes the\nLutheran point that this is to try to hold God to human standards of\njustice and rightness; but it is a mistake to assume that these can\ncan be applied in this\n context.[6]\n While obviously dialectically effective to use Luther in this way to\nrefute a Bishop, and while the question of the nature of\nHobbes\u2019s own religious commitments remains a matter of\n controversy,[7]\n Hobbes\u2019s appeal to Luther in this manner is no mere\nopportunism, and shows an understanding of and familiarity with\nLuther\u2019s writing on free will which is more than purely\nsuperficial.\n\nHowever, it can still be questioned whether by transposing these\nLutheran considerations into the context of his own mechanistic\nmaterialism, Hobbes could do them proper justice; and of course, for\nLuther the philosophical issues surrounding such materialism were of\nlittle concern, and nor is his conception of God merely that of the\nkind of \u201cfirst mover\u201d that he is taken to be by\n Hobbes.[8]\n There is thus no place in Hobbes\u2019s account for what we have\nseen is so distinctive to Luther\u2019s, namely that there is a kind\nof spiritual comfort to be found in the abandonment of the idea of\nfree choice, both in the way that the predestination that comes with\nit can make us more certain of God\u2019s promises, and in the way it\nliberates us from the kind of anxiety we would feel if salvation\ndepended on our proper exercise of this choice. Moreover, as discussed in Luther entry \u00a74, Luther has arguments against free choice that are\nindependent of any commitment to materialism, which rest instead on\nhis claim that there can be no \u201cneutral\u201d normative space\nfor the free will to exercise its choices as Erasmus had claimed: for\nit is either a good will which will see the good as its only option\nand so not be faced with any choice, or a bad will which thinks that\nthe bad is also an option it should consider, but then qua\nwill it is always turned away from the good and so has no choice in\nthis direction\n either.[9]\n As others have noted, these deeper aspects of Luther\u2019s\nposition, which have nothing to do with Hobbes\u2019s materialism, in\nthe end make their respective approaches to these questions very\ndifferent (see Damrosch 1979, Overhoff 1997).\n\nAs well as this issue of free will, it is also intriguing to consider\nanother point of connection between the two thinkers, namely the\ninfluence of Luther on Hobbes\u2019s political and social philosophy,\nthough this issue is less explicitly documented through Hobbes\u2019s\nworks than the previous one. Nonetheless, both shared a belief in the\nneed for a powerful state if the precariousness of life in a state of\nnature is to be avoided, given the lack of community between fallen\nindividuals, so that both can be said to offer similar justifications\nfor state authority, while then perhaps as a result being guilty of\ntending towards authoritarianism in their political thought. (For\nfurther comparison, see Kodalle 1990.)\n\nIf Hobbes\u2019s materialism and (consequently) suspected atheism\nadds an interesting complexity to his relation to Luther, in\nLeibniz\u2019s case a complexity is added through the latter\u2019s\ncommitment to ecumenism (reflected in his Catholic\nDemonstrations project of 1668\u201369 and subsequent works),\nand his rationalism, on which some of his ecumenical plans were based,\nas he hoped that common ground between doctrinal differences might be\nbased on fresh insights made possible by new developments in\nphilosophy and the sciences. Nonetheless, as with Hobbes,\nnotwithstanding these divergences in Leibniz\u2019s case, a clear\nLutheran influence and context is still to be found, traceable to his\nupbringing and education (see Goldenbaum 1988: 171; Antognazza 2009:\nChap 1), which drew him towards Lutheranism in a moderate form.\n\nAs Leibniz himself writes, from his \u201cvery tender youth\nonwards\u201d, even before he went to university, he \u201ccame\nacross a part of Luther\u2019s book De servo\narbitrio\u201d, while going on to study works written on this\nissue not only by other Lutherans and by Reformed writers, but also\nthose in the Catholic tradition (see Backus 2016: 257, notes 10 and\n11). Leibniz\u2019s interest in this debate was later to lead him to\ncontribute belatedly to the controversy between Hobbes and Bramhall\noutlined above, which he discusses in an appendix to his\nTheodicy (1710): \u201cReflexions on the Work that Mr.\nHobbes Published in English on \u2018Freedom, Necessity and\nChance\u2019\u201d. Leibniz notes that Hobbes\u2019s view that\n\u201cdivine foreknowledge would be sufficient to establish an\nabsolute necessity of events\u201d resembles that of Luther in De\nservo arbitrio, or at least Luther there \u201cspoke so\u201d;\nbut then Leibniz suggests this Lutheran position goes further than it\nneeds to do, as \n\n\nit is sufficiently acknowledged today that the kind of necessity which\nis termed hypothetical, and springs from foreknowledge or from other\nanterior reasons, has nothing in it to arouse one\u2019s alarm:\nwhereas it would be quite otherwise if the thing were necessary of\nitself, in such a way that the contrary implied contradiction.\n(Leibniz 1710 [1985: Appendix \u00a73, p. 393]) \n\n\nIn embracing and developing this Scholastic distinction, between a\ncertainty based on the knowledge of causes, and a logical necessity\nthat means that things could not have been otherwise, Leibniz is\ntherefore arguing that it would have been quite possible for Luther to\npreserve his commitment to divine foreknowledge on the one hand,\nwithout playing into the hands of a hard determinist like Hobbes on\nthe other.\n\nThe Theodicy also contains discussion of another key Lutheran\nissue, namely the relation between faith and reason, which is\nspecifically raised in a \u201cpreliminary dissertation\u201d at the\nstart of the text. In reviewing the history of debates on this\nquestion, Leibniz admits that Luther \u201cspoke sometimes as if [he]\nrejected philosophy and deemed it inimical to faith\u201d, but he\nthen seeks to qualify Luther\u2019s position, arguing that by\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d Luther meant our understanding of nature, or\nthe philosophy of the schools, so that it is only philosophy in this\nnarrow sense that cannot comprehend matters of faith. Leibniz likewise\nnotes Luther\u2019s early hostility to Aristotle, but that \n\n\nat last he curbed his vehemence and in the Apology for the\nAugsburg Confession allowed [Melanchthon to include] a favourable\nmention of Aristotle and his Ethics. (1710 [1985: \u00a712, p. 81])\n\n\n\nLeibniz also offers a moderate reading of Luther\u2019s claims\nconcerning the differences between revealed truths and the mysteries\nof the Gospel on the one hand, and reason on the other (1710 [1985:\n\u00a749, p. 101; \u00a767, pp. 110\u201311]). Rather than\nattributing this view to Luther, therefore, Leibniz goes on to suggest\nthat it is later theologians in various traditions, as well as figures\nsuch as Pierre Bayle, who had made the opposition of faith and reason\ninto a sharp one. Leibniz himself tries to blunt this opposition by\nappealing to a distinction between what is above reason in\nthe sense that reason cannot fully comprehend it, and what is\ncontrary to reason, arguing that while matters of faith may\nfall into the former category, they cannot fall into the latter, so\nthat \n\n\nonce a dogma has been disputed and refuted by reason, instead of its\nbeing incomprehensible, one may say that nothing is easier to\nunderstand, nor more obvious, than its absurdity. (1710 [1985:\n\u00a723, p. 88]) \n\n\n(For further discussion of Leibniz\u2019s approach, see Antognazza\n2008: Introduction, 2018a; Goldenbaum 1998; Hillman 2013; Schweitz\n2011.)\n\nLeibniz\u2019s writings on theology thus become focused on\nestablishing what he seems to have viewed as this moderate Lutheran\nposition, of showing across a range of issues that what might appear\ncontrary to reason is often merely above it (see Antognazza\n 2018b).[10]\n One central theological issue which Leibniz deals with in this way,\nand which as we have seen concerned Luther (see\n Luther entry \u00a72)\n and became a crucial matter of dispute within the later Reformation,\nwas the question of the Eucharist. Unsurprisingly, therefore, this\nissue becomes central for Leibniz too, both in his ecumenical attempts\nto find common ground between the various Christian traditions, and to\nshow how a reason informed by new developments in philosophical\nthinking (most especially his own) can find a way forward in these\napparently intractable debates (see Backus 2016: Chapters 1 and 2;\nMercer 2002: 82\u201389; Fouke 1992). Nonetheless, despite his\necumenical endeavours, it has been noted (Adams 1994: 354\u20135;\nAntognazza 2018b: 746\u201348) that Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics works\nbest as an attempt to make sense of the Eucharist when this is\nconceived along the lines of the Lutheran position of real presence\nrather than the Catholic conception of\n transubstantiation.[11]\n To this extent his metaphysics more generally may be said to operate\nwithin a broadly Lutheran outlook, though one which (thanks to the\ninfluence of Melanchthon and others) had more room in it than Luther\nhimself may have liked for Aristotelian ideas of the sort Leibniz\nemployed to deal with these issues, such as substantial form (see\nMercer 2002:\n 101).[12]\n",
