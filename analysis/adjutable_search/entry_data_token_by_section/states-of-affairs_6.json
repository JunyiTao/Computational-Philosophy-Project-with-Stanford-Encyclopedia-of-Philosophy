It also yields an understanding of\nthe main features of facts. The argument can be summed up as\nfollows:\n\n(P1)\n Every truth must have a truth-maker.\n(P2)\nThe best candidates to occupy the truth-maker role are facts.\n(C)\nThere are facts. \n\n\nArmstrong takes (P1) to articulate the following intuitive asymmetry:\nIt is true that Socrates is wise because Socrates is wise;\nbut Socrates is not wise because it is true that Socrates is\nwise (see Armstrong 2004: 4). In Armstrong\u2019s terminology a\ntruth-bearer is true in virtue of (made true by) the\nexistence of another entity, a truth-maker. A truth-maker ensures or\nguarantees the truth of a truth-bearer. Some authors take this\nguarantee to be a form of necessitation: x makes it true that\np if, and only if, necessarily, if x exists, it is true\nthat p.\n\nThis brings us to the second premise of the Truthmaker-Argument. Why\nare facts the best candidates for the truth-maker role? Let us work\nthrough some alternatives. Take the thought that Socrates is wise. The\nexistence of which object necessitates its truth? Socrates can exist\nwithout being wise. Hence, Socrates is not the truth-maker we\nare looking for.\n\nThe last point suggests that only a complex entity that\n\u201ccontains\u201d Socrates as well as the property of being\nwise is a candidate for the truth-maker role. The mereological\nsum of Socrates and being wise, that is, the whole that has\nonly Socrates and wisdom as parts, satisfies this condition, yet it\ncannot fulfill the truth-maker role. If Socrates and wisdom exist,\ntheir mereological sum exists. Hence, the sum exists whether it is\ntrue that Socrates is wise or not. For similar reasons the set that\ncontains only Socrates and being wise cannot be the\ntruth-maker of the thought that Socrates is wise. Armstrong concludes\nthat only the fact that Socrates is wise that \u201cties\u201d\nSocrates and being wise makes it true that Socrates is wise\n(see Armstrong 1997: 118).\n\nArmstrong\u2019s conception of truthmaking is controversial (see, for\ninstance, Restall 1996). I will set its problems aside here and focus\non clarifying the relation between facts and states of affairs. Facts\n\u201ctie\u201d particulars and universals. This brings them close\nto states of affairs that also involve particulars and universals.\nWhat distinguishes them is that the existence of a fact is supposed to\nguarantee the truth of a truth-bearer. The existence of the fact that\na is F can only guarantee the truth of the thought that\na is F if one cannot distinguish facts into those that\nobtain and those that do not obtain. Saying of the fact that Socrates\nis wise that it obtains is redundant, while it is not redundant to say\nso of the state of affairs Socrates\u2019 being wise.\n\nFacts are also introduced in order to stop a regress of instantiation.\nTake the particular a and the property of being\nF and assume that they can exist independently of each other.\nGiven this assumption, there must be a relation that\n\u201cties\u201d them together to a\u2019s being\nF. If the required \u201ctie\u201d is a genuine\nrelation, a regress, usually called Bradley\u2019s regress,\nensues: we need to introduce another relation that ties the first\nrelation to a and being F, and so on. Facts are supposed\nto prevent Bradley\u2019s regress (see Armstrong 1997: 115 and 118;\nHossack 2007: 33). How? Relations that tie particulars and properties\ntogether are \u201cexplained away\u201d in terms of facts that\ncontain particulars and properties: if a instantiates\nF-ness, it does so because the fact that a is\nF exists. The existence of this fact guarantees that a\nis F. Facts are just instantiations of universals by\nparticulars (see Armstrong 1997: 119). Hence, we arrive again at the\nresult that the obtaining/non-obtaining distinction does not apply to\nfacts.\n\nIn contrast to facts the obtaining/non-obtaining distinction divides\nstates of affairs into those that obtain and those that do not obtain\n(see\n section 1).\n For this reason states of affairs cannot be truthmakers: their\nexistence does not necessitate the truth of a truth-bearer. The state\nof affairs Socrates\u2019 being foolish exists in some\npossible worlds in which Socrates is foolish, but it also exists in\npossible worlds in which Socrates is not foolish. Vallicella\nreinforces this point:\n\n\n[Facts] are not to be confused with abstract states of affairs which\neither obtain or do not obtain depending on how the world is. The\nlatter are themselves in need of something in the world that explains\nwhy they obtain. (Vallicella 2000: 237)\n\n",
