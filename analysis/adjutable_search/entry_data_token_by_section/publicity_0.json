    "main_text": "Hypothetical Publicity || Kant\u2019s Hypothetical Publicity Test\n1.1 Kant\u2019s Hypothetical Publicity Test\nKant\u2019s hypothetical publicity test appears in the second appendix to his Zum ewigen Frieden (Perpetual Peace) (1795 [1923: 381]).[1] He writes:\n\nAll actions relating to the right of other human beings are wrong if their maxim is incompatible with publicity.[2]\n\nThere are at least three interesting issues here. First, what is the justification for such a publicity test? Is there any reason to suspect any connection between the demands of publicity and the rightness of a position? Second, which maxims of action and, more generally, which moral theories are likely not to pass such a publicity test? Third, what does this test entail with regard to the need for actual publicity?\nSome interpretative issues can quickly be disposed of. First, the Kantian test applies specifically to political maxims and is the equivalent in that sphere of the more general categorical imperative.[3] This is why Kant refers to it as the \u201ctranscendental principle of the publicity of public law\u201d (1795 [1923: 382]). Second, this Kantian test is a merely negative one: passing the test is only a necessary condition for a maxim\u2019s rightness. It is therefore not sufficient to guarantee that all maxims that pass this test are right. This is suggested both by the expression \u201cwrong if\u201d and by Kant\u2019s explicit statement: \u201cthis principle is, furthermore, only negative, i.e., it only serves for the recognition of what is not just to others\u201d.[4] Such a reading entails a difference with the categorical imperative insofar as the latter is a necessary and sufficient condition for permissibility. Third, it is also clear from the principle that neither an action itself, nor the actual motives underlying such an action (Davis 1991: 418) must be capable of being successfully disclosed in order to guarantee that they are not wrong. The test applies only to the maxim of such an action, which indicates one respect in which such a hypothetical test might leave room for actual secrecy. This claim is true irrespective of whether David Luban is correct in suggesting that:\n\nthe best way to make sure that officials formulate policies that could withstand publicity is by increasing the likelihood that policies will withstand publicity (Luban 1996: 157).[5]\n\nNow, what does Kant mean when he uses the word \u201cpublicity\u201d? Were we to face an actual public, we could give it a more or less demanding interpretation, ranging from merely general knowledge (each of us actually knows or is able to know) or mutual knowledge (each of us knows, and knows that the others know), to critical debate where what we know is being actively discussed (Luban 1996: 169\u2013172). The latter form of publicity, while seeming much richer and appealing, probably does not fit the Kantian text.[6] It could itself be understood in two ways. Either, publicity would be taken as a synonym of debateability, i.e., the fact that the maxim be such as to be deemed appropriate for public discussion, in which case the test would exclude very little. Alternatively, were it taken as referring to the ability of a maxim to pass the filter of actual public debate and be accepted by its participants, the test would then have a very contingent outcome, depending on the real public we are facing.\nWe can try to ascertain whether publicity should be understood as general knowledge, mutual knowledge, or publicity as the outcome of public debate.[7] However, in the context of understanding the nature of the Kantian test, what matters much more is that Kant is referring to an ideal and rational public (Davis 1992: 180f.).[8] The test is thus hypothetical, not only because it does not necessarily require actual publicity (as we shall see), but also because any outcome of actual publicity must inevitably remain at best a rough approximation of what the test would lead us to with an ideal public.[9]\n",
