    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n6. Natural Philosophy\n\n\nMedieval natural philosophy included both the rich commentary\ntradition on Aristotle's Physics, as well as treatises and\ncommentaries on Aristotle's other writings about the natural world:\nOn the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption, De\nanima, the short treatises on animate powers known as the\n\u2018Parva Naturalia\u2019, and the works on the history,\nparts, and generation of animals. Buridan wrote commentaries on nearly\nall of these texts. Like his contemporaries, he understood the\nspeculative sub-disciplines of physics as an orderly progression of\nteachings. Thus, demonstration in psychology was thought to borrow its\nprinciples or starting points from physics, the higher science to\nwhich it is subordinated, with its conclusions in turn supplying\nprinciples for demonstrations in the more specialized studies of\nsensation and animal locomotion. The ordering metaphor is never far\nfrom Buridan's mind. He remarks to readers of his commentary on\nAristotle's De motibus animalium that in this book, \u201cwe\ndescend to the different species of motion in particular, e.g., to the\nfact that some animals fly, others swim, and so on\u201d (DMA I:\n535)\n\n\nBesides logic, natural philosophy is the other field in which Buridan\nhas enjoyed some recognition. This is largely due to the efforts of\nthe pioneering historians of science Pierre Duhem and Anneliese Maier,\nwho saw that Buridan played a key role in the demise of the\nAristotelian view of the\n cosmos.[49]\n Buridan's major contribution here was to develop and popularize the\ntheory of impetus, or impressed force, to explain projectile\nmotion. Rejecting the discredited Aristotelian idea of antiperistasis,\naccording to which the tendency of a thrown projectile to continue\nmoving is due to a proximate but external moving cause (such as the\nair surrounding\n it),[50]\n he argues that only an internal motive force, transmitted from the\nmover to the projectile, could explain its continued motion. The\ntheory of impetus probably did not originate with\n Buridan,[51]\n but his account appears to be unique in that he entertains the\npossibility that it might not be self-dissipating: \u201cafter\nleaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an\nimpetus given to it by the thrower,\u201d he says, \u201cand would\ncontinue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the\nresistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished\nand corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something\ninclining it to a contrary motion\u201d (QM XII.9: 73ra). He also\ncontends that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined\nby the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject, so that the\nacceleration of a falling body can be understood in terms of its\ngradual accumulation of units of impetus. But despite its\nrevolutionary implications, Buridan did not use the concept of impetus\nto transform the science of mechanics. He was not, as Duhem argued, a\nforerunner of Galileo. He remained unapologetically Aristotelian in\ntoo many other respects, continuing to hold that motion and rest are\ncontrary states of bodies and that the world is finite in\nextent. Buridan seems to have been a philosopher who, though well\naware of the shortcomings of the Aristotelian natural philosophy,\ntried to reshape as much of it as he could in the face of a rapidly\nmechanizing\n worldview.[52]\n His revolution was in the details. The big, decisive break was left\nto his successors.\n\n\nBuridan's account of motion is in keeping with his approach to natural\nscience, which is empirical in the sense that it emphasizes the\nevidentness of appearances, the reliability of a posteriori modes of\nreasoning, and the application of naturalistic tropes or models of\nexplanation (such as the concept of impetus) to a variety of\nphenomena.  He is inclined to dismiss purely theological assumptions\nas irrelevant to the practice of philosophy, as we see in the\nfollowing tongue-in-cheek remark: \u201cone might assume that there\nare many more separate substances than there are celestial spheres and\ncelestial motions, viz., great legions of angels [magnae legiones\nangelorum], but this cannot be proved by demonstrative arguments\noriginating from sense perception\u201d (QM II.9: \n73ra).[53] But there are some\ntheological considerations that must be taken seriously.  He concedes\nthat divine omnipotence is such that it is always possible for God to\ndeceive us in ways we could never detect, although this is tempered by\nhis confidence, for which he cites empirical evidence, that our\nordinary powers of perception and inductive inference are sufficiently\nreliable to make \u201cthe comprehension of truth with certitude\npossible for us\u201d (QM II.1: 9ra). He has little patience for\nskeptical arguments questioning the possibility of scientific\nknowledge, such as those he believed to have been advanced by Nicholas\nof Autrecourt, arguing that it is absurd to demand that all knowledge\nbe demonstrable by reduction to the principle of non-contradiction.\nNatural science is about what happens for the most part, i.e.,\nassuming the common course of nature (Zupko 2003, chs. 12\u201313). For the\nsame reason, explanatory models in one special science can be usually\napplied to others in a way that enhances our understanding of the\nphenomena. Thus, the concept of impetus recurs in Buridan's psychology\nto explain the difference between occurrent and dispositional\nthinking, as well as in his ethics, to account for the relative ease\nwith which virtuous persons are able to do the right thing (they have\nacquired, or cultivated within themselves, an impetus to act\nvirtuously).\n\n\nIn psychology, the study of moving beings qua animate,\nBuridan changed the Aristotelian paradigm in important ways. In\ncontrast with Thomas Aquinas, who wanted to attribute metaphysically\nmore robust qualities, such as per se subsistence, to the\nhuman soul, Buridan does not think that psychology is in a position to\nreveal anything about the inherent nature of its subject, and so he\nrefuses to speculate about it (Zupko 2007a). He sees the science of\npsychology as concerned not with some quidditative concept of the soul\narrived at by a priori reasoning, but with specifying the\nrelation between animate qualities and the soul as their proper\nsubject: \u201cthe natural philosopher only studies substances in\nrelation to their motion and operations (see Zupko 2007b, 2008,\n2017ab). And since natural forms require for their operations a\ndeterminate matter made suitable for them by qualitative and\nquantitative dispositions, natural scientists must define forms\nthrough their proper matter. Therefore, in its natural definition, the\nsoul must be defined by means of a physical, organic body\u201d (QDA\nII.3). This led to an even more attenuated conception of the soul in\nthe De anima commentaries of Buridan's Parisian successors,\nNicole Oresme and Peter of Ailly, for whom the soul functions as a\nkind of placeholder whose nature is not even relevant to psychology.\nConsideration of the soul's ultimate nature migrated to the faculty of\ntheology, where it was considered along with the same Augustinian\ndreaming arguments that undoubtedly influenced Descartes (See Zupko\n1999 and 2003, chs. 10\u201311).\n",
