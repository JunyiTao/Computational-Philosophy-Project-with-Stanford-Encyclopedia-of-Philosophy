    "main_text": "The Background to Descartes\u2019 Mathematical Researches || Geometrical Analysis and Algebra\n1.2 Geometrical Analysis and Algebra\n\nVi\u00e8te\u2019s program of geometrical problem-solving had an\nadded significance: By adopting as his postulate that the neusis\nproblem could be solved, Vi\u00e8te was able to link geometrical\nconstruction with his algebraic analysis of geometrical problems and\nshow that cubic equations had a genuinely geometrical solution (i.e.,\nthat the roots of cubic equations could be constructed by\nconsideration of intersecting geometrical curves).\nVi\u00e8te\u2019s program nicely illustrates the merging of algebra\nwith geometrical problem-solving in early modern mathematics, and\nmoreover, nicely illustrates an influential way of interpreting\nPappus\u2019s claims in the Collection regarding how a\nmathematician should apply the methods of analysis and synthesis in\ngeometrical problem-solving.\n\nAs noted above, Pappus\u2019s remarks concerning the two-fold method\nof analysis (resolutio) and synthesis (compositio)\nin the Collection received a great deal of attention from\nearly modern readers. And as with his remarks concerning the\nconstruction of geometrical curves, there were ambiguities in his\ndiscussion, which motivated varying interpretations of the method and\nits application to geometrical problems. Here is a portion of what\nPappus claims of analysis and synthesis in Book VII of the\nCollection:\n\n\nNow analysis is the path from what one is seeking, as if it were\nestablished, by way of its consequences, to something that is\nestablished by synthesis. That is to say, in analysis we assume what\nis sought as if it has been achieved, and look for the thing from\nwhich it follows, and again what comes before that, until by\nregressing in this way we come upon some one of the things that are\nalready known, or that occupy the rank of a first principle. We call\nthis kind of method \u201canalysis,\u201d as if to say anapalin\nlysis (reduction backward). In synthesis, by reversal, we assume\nwhat was obtained last in the analysis to have been achieved already,\nand, setting now in natural order, as precedents, what before were\nfollowing, and fitting them to each other, we attain the end of the\nconstruction of what was sought. This is what we call\n\u201csynthesis\u201d (Pappus, 82\u201383).\n\n\nSome of the directives Pappus offers here seem straightforward. The\nmathematician begins by assuming what is sought after as if it has\nbeen achieved until, through analysis, she reaches something that is\nalready known. Then, the mathematician reverses the steps, and through\nsynthesis, sets out \u201cin natural order\u201d the deduction\nleading from what is known to what is sought after. However, there are\nambiguities in Pappus\u2019s discussion. Perhaps most importantly, it\nis not clear how reversing the steps of analysis could offer a proof,\nor synthesis, of a stated problem, since the deductions of analysis\nrely on conditionals (if \\(x\\), then \\(y)\\) whereas a\nreversal would require biconditionals \\((x\\) iff \\(y)\\) to\nachieve synthesis (see Guicciardini 2009, 31\u201338 for further\ninterpretative problems surrounding Pappus\u2019s remarks; for more\non analysis and synthesis in the Renaissance see the classic Hintikka\nand Remes 1974, the essays in Otte and Panza 1997, and Panza 2007).\nAmbiguities notwithstanding, for Vi\u00e8te and other early modern\nmathematicians there was one feature of the discussion that was\nincredibly important: Pappus makes clear that the ancients had a\nmethod of analysis at their disposal, and many early modern\nmathematicians attempted to align this method from antiquity with the\nalgebraic methods of geometrical analysis that they were using.\n\nPrior to the end of the sixteenth century, mathematicians had already\nused algebra in the analysis of geometrical problems, but the program\nVi\u00e8te details marks a significant step forward. On the one\nhand, in his Isagoge [Introduction to the analytic\nart] of 1591, which was presented as part of a larger project to\nrestore ancient analysis (entitled Book of the restored\nmathematical analysis or the new algebra), Vi\u00e8te\nintroduces a notation that allowed him to treat magnitudes in a\ngeneral way. The literal symbols he uses (consonants and vowels\ndepending on whether the variable in the equation was unknown or\nindeterminate, respectively) represent magnitudes generally and do not\nspecify whether they are arithmetical magnitudes (numbers) or\ngeometrical magnitudes (such as line segments or angles). He can thus\nrepresent arithmetic operations as applied to magnitudes in general.\nFor instance, \\(A + B\\) represents the addition of two\nmagnitudes and does not specify whether \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nnumbers (in which case the addition represents a process of counting)\nor geometrical objects (in which case the addition represents the\ncombination of two line segments) (see Vi\u00e8te 1591, 11\u201327;\nfor the significance of Vi\u00e8te\u2019s \u201cnew algebra\u201d\nfor early modern mathematics see Bos 2001, Chp. 8; Mahoney 1973, Chp.\n2; and Pycior 1997, Chp. 1).\n\nOn the other hand, the algebraic, symbolic analysis of geometrical\nproblems that Vi\u00e8te proposes was offered as the first step in a\nthree-step process that could render a geometrical solution. The three\nstages were: (1) zetetics, which involved the algebraic\nanalysis (or elaboration) of a problem; (2) poristics, which\nclarified the relations between magnitudes by appeal to the theory of\nproportions (see Giusti 1992 on the importance of proportion theory\nfor Vi\u00e8te\u2019s mathematics); and (3) exegetics,\nwhich offered the genuine geometrical solution (or proof) of the\nproblem. To better understand the connection between the stages of\nzetetics and exegetics, which roughly correspond to\nthe ancient stages of analysis and synthesis, consider the problem of\nidentifying two mean proportionals. Geometrically, the problem is as\nfollows:\n\n\nGiven line segments \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that\n\\(a : x :: x : y :: y : b\\), or put differently, such that\n\n\\[ \n \\frac{a}{x} : \\frac{x}{y} : \\frac{y}{b}\n\\]\n\n\nIn the zetetic (analytic) stage of Vi\u00e8te\u2019s\nanalysis, we follow Pappus\u2019s directive to treat \u201cwhat is\nsought as if it has been achieved\u201d precisely by naming the\nunknowns by variables. Then, by assuming the equivalence between\nproportions (as Vi\u00e8te does), we can solve for the variables\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and establish that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nhave the following relationship to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n\\(x^2 = ay\\) and\n\\(y^2 = xb\\).\n\n\nSolving (1) for \\(y\\), we have \\(y = x^2 /a\\), and by substitution into (2), we\nget \\(y^2 = (x^2 /a)^2 = x^4 /a^2 = xb\\), which\nyields:\n\n\\(x^3 = a^2 b\\).\n\n\nSolving (2) for \\(x\\), we have \\(x = y^2 /b\\), and by substitution\ninto (1), we get \\(x^2 = (y^2 /b)^2 = y^4 /b^2 = ay\\), which\nyields:\n\n\\(y^3 = ab^2.\\)\n\n\nAlgebraically, then, the problem of finding two mean proportional can\nbe elaborated as follows:\n\n\nGiven (magnitudes) \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the problem is to find\n(magnitudes) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x^3 = a^2 b\\) and \n\\(y^3 = ab^2\\).\n\n\n\nIn this zetetic stage of analysis, the geometrical problem is\ntransformed into the algebraic problem of solving a standard-form\ncubic equation (i.e., a cubic equation that does not include a\nquadratic term). However, for Vi\u00e8te, the genuine solution to\nthe problem must be supplied in the stage of exegetics, which offers\nthe geometrical construction and thus the synthesis, or\n proof.[3]\n And it is here that the neusis postulate supplies the guarantee that\nsuch a solution can be found: By assuming the neusis problem solved,\nwe can construct the curve that satisfies the two cubic equations\nabove (i.e., we can construct the roots of the equations) and thereby\nconstruct the sought after mean proportionals. In other words, there\nwas an assumed equivalence in Vi\u00e8te\u2019s program between\nsolving an algebraic problem that required identifying the roots of\nspecified cubic equations and solving a geometrical problem that\nrequired the construction of a curve. We also see this in his\ntreatment of trisecting an angle: To solve the angle-trisection\nproblem is to solve two standard-form cubic equations, which\nVi\u00e8te reveals in his algebraic elaboration of the geometrical\nproblem (cf. Bos 2001, 173\u2013176). In fact, assuming the neusis\npostulate, we can solve any standard-form cubic equation, and since it\nwas already known at the time that all fourth-degree equations are\nreducible to standard-form cubic equations, what Vi\u00e8te supplied\nwith his marriage of algebra and geometry in his 1594\nSupplement was a program that solved all line-like problems\nthat could be elaborated in terms of cubic and quartic equations.\n\nAs powerful as Vi\u00e8te\u2019s program was, questions remained\nfor practicing mathematicians. Should we, as Vi\u00e8te urged,\naccept the neusis postulate as \u201cnot difficult\u201d and thus as\na foundational construction principle for geometry? And should we\nfollow Vi\u00e8te in claiming that other curves that had significant\nproblem-solving power in geometry\u2014such as the spiral and\nquadratrix\u2014were not legitimately geometrical because they could\nnot be constructed by neusis? Moreover, there were questions about the\nconnection Vi\u00e8te forged between algebra and geometry. For\nDescartes in particular, there were questions of whether there was a\ndeeper, more fundamental connection that could be forged between the\nsolutions of algebraic problems that were expressed in terms of\nequations and the solutions of geometrical problems that required the\nconstruction of curves. However, these questions did not come into\nfull relief for Descartes until the early 1630s, after more than a\ndecade of studying problems in both geometry and algebra.\n",
