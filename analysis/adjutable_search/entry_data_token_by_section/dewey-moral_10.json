    "main_text": "Means and Ends\n3. Means and Ends\n\nThe standard objection to Dewey\u2019s instrumental theory of value\njudgments is that it concerns the value of things as means only, and\nnot as ends. It fails to fix on what is ultimately important:\nintrinsic values or final ends. Some ultimate end outside of practice\nmust be postulated as given, as the standard against which the value\nof acts as means can be judged, lest we fall into an infinite regress.\nWe either need some conception of a summum bonum, justified\napart from practical reasoning, toward which acts must aim, or\nDewey\u2019s theory reduces to a form of Humean instrumentalism, in\nwhich ends are given by our desires or immediate likings, and the only\nquestion is how to satisfy them.\n\nDewey\u2019s reply to this objection goes to the heart of his moral\nphilosophy. He argued that the character and value of means and ends\nwas reciprocally determined. We do not first already have an end in\nview, with the only question how to achieve it. We lack a complete\nconception of our end until we have a complete grasp of the course of\naction that will take us there. Moreover, a judgment of the value of\nends apart from the means needed to get there, and apart from the\nvalue of ends as means \u2014 as things that have consequences of\ntheir own \u2014 cannot provide the basis for rational action. Acting\non such radically truncated judgments would be crazy. Our judgments of\nthe worth of an end are inextricably tied up with our judgments of the\ncosts of achieving it, both in terms of the means needed to get there\nand the unintended consequences of getting there. Practical judgment\nis creative: it institutes new ends-in-view. It is transformative:\nappraisals affect our immediate valuings of things.\n",
