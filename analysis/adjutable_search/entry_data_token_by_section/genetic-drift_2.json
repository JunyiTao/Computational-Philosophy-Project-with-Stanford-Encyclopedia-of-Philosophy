    "main_text": "What Is Drift, and Can It Be Distinguished from Natural Selection? || A Historically-Derived Account of Drift: The Causal Process Account\n2.1 A Historically-Derived Account of Drift: The Causal Process Account\n\nReflecting on the historical uses of the term \u201cdrift\u201d,\nBeatty states that\n\n\nwhat most of the phenomena so designated [as drift] have in common is\none or another biological form of random or indiscriminate sampling,\nand consequent sampling error. (Beatty 1992: 273; see also Plutynski\net al. 2016 on the modern synthesis authors\u2019 agreement on this\npoint)\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with indiscriminate sampling. Beatty states that\nparent sampling is\n\n\nthe process of determining which organisms of one generation will\nbe parents of the next, and how many offspring each parent will\nhave (1984: 188; italics in original)\n\n\nBeatty maintains that this parent sampling can be discriminate, that\nis, with regard to physical differences, or indiscriminate, that is,\nwithout regard to physical differences (1984: 189). Discriminate\nparent sampling is generally considered natural selection;\nindiscriminate parent sampling is random drift. Beatty characterizes\ngamete sampling similarly, as\n\n\nthe process of determining which of the two genetically different\ntypes of gametes produced by a heterozygotic parent is actually\ncontributed to each of its offspring (1984: 189; italics in\noriginal)\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\nThis sort of sampling might be indiscriminate in the sense that any\nphysical difference between the two types of gametes produced by a\nheterozygote might be irrelevant to whether one or the other is\nactually contributed to any particular offspring. (1984: 189)\n\n\nAnd again, the indiscriminate form of sampling is drift while\ndiscriminate gamete sampling would be selection.\n\nSeveral illustrations of indiscriminate sampling are common in the\nliterature, but some are more helpful than others. One is a\nhypothetical scenario in which two genetically and phenotypically\nidentical twins are walking together; one is struck by lightning\nwhereas the other lives to reproduce. (The example seems to have its\norigins in Scriven 1959 and Mills and Beatty 1979, although these\nauthors were making a point about fitness, not about drift). This is\nan unfortunate illustration in part because it is too easy to get\ncaught up in the question of whether the twins are really\ngenetically and physically identical, but, more importantly, it is\nmisleading because in fact, drift requires heritable\nvariation, just as selection does. The lightning example is also\nproblematic because it makes drift seem exceptional and catastrophic,\nwhereas it is generally considered to be pervasive (i.e., occurring in\nall populations) and not necessarily due to catastrophic or unusual\nevents. Others (e.g., Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew\n2002) use a series of coin tosses as an illustration of drift, but\nthis could be challenged because it encourages binary thinking,\ninstead of allowing for multiple variants with multiple outcomes, and\nbecause it is unclear what the \u201cpopulation\u201d of coin flips\namounts to.\n\nA better illustration of drift has its origins in Theodosius\nDobzhansky\u2019s (1937) discussion of Dubinin and Romaschoff\u2019s\n(1932) model, which asks us to imagine an urn filled with different\ncolored balls. If the balls are drawn from the urn without respect to\ncolor, e.g., by a person drawing balls while blindfolded, then the\nballs are being indiscriminately sampled (unlike discriminate\nsampling, where someone deliberately tries to pick balls of a certain\ncolor). If a large sample of balls is taken, we expect the frequencies\nof colored balls in the sample drawn from the urn to be very close to\nthe frequencies in the urn. If only a small sample of colored balls is\ndrawn from the urn, then our sample may very well have different\nproportions of colored balls than the urn does. Multiple samplings\ntaken over time, which would correspond to multiple generations, would\ntend to exhibit a pattern of fluctuating frequencies (recall the quote\nfrom Darwin above). The illustration thus models the population, its\nvariants with their physical differences, and gives a clear\nunderstanding of the possible outcomes. It is also easily\nextrapolatable to, e.g., colorblind predators (Hodge 1987) and other\nindiscriminate sampling agents. It does, however, have some\nlimitations; for example, it lacks an analogue for reproduction, since\nthe balls do not produce offspring, multiple or otherwise.\n\nAlthough the characterization of drift and selection in terms of\nindiscriminate and discriminate sampling seems straightforward, with\nBeatty\u2019s explication of indiscriminate sampling an important\nclarification of what the Hagedoorns, Fisher, and Wright seem to have\nmeant by \u201crandom\u201d sampling, Beatty (1984) raises a problem\nfor the conceptual distinction between natural selection and random\ndrift. The problem is as follows: For every population of organisms in\na given environment, with a certain distribution of types and\nassociated fitnesses, there is a range of possible outcomes of natural\nselection, with some more likely than others. It is, of course, more\nlikely that the fitter organisms will have greater reproductive\nsuccess in the next generation than the less fit, but it is also\npossible that they will not. (Darwin repeatedly emphasized this chance\nelement of natural selection). So, what do we say about the outcomes\nwhere the less fit outreproduce the more fit? Beatty states:\n\n\nTo the extent that those outcomes are less representative of\nthe physical abilities of those organisms to survive and reproduce in\nthe environment in question, any evolutionary change that results will\nbe more a matter of random drift,\n\n\nconcluding that it is\n\n\nconceptually difficult to distinguish natural selection from random\ndrift, especially where improbable results of natural\nselection are concerned (Beatty 1984: 196; emphasis in\noriginal)\n\n\nAs will be discussed further below, much of the twentieth century was\nmarked by debates among biologists about the relative importance of\ndrift and selection in evolution. Were those debates at least in part\nthe result of conceptual unclarity? Millstein (2002) argues that we\nneed not accept this inadvertent consequence of Beatty\u2019s\nargument, and that selection can, in fact, be distinguished from\ndrift. In order to do this, three extensions should be made to\nBeatty\u2019s account. First, similar to Hodge (1987), Millstein\nsuggests that a proper distinction between drift and selection relies\non causation, specifically, that drift processes are indiscriminate\nsampling processes in which any heritable physical differences between\nentities (organisms, gametes, etc.) are causally\nirrelevant to differences in reproductive success, whereas\nnatural selection processes are discriminate sampling processes in\nwhich any heritable physical differences between entities (organisms,\ngametes, etc.) are causally relevant to differences in\nreproductive success. These more precise characterizations of\n\u201cindiscriminate sampling\u201d and \u201cdiscriminate\nsampling\u201d are intended to replace the metaphorical\n\u201csampling\u201d talk, retaining the term \u201csampling\u201d\nas a useful shorthand only. Second, we should be careful to\ndistinguish the process of drift from the outcomes\nthat drift produces, and the process of selection from the\noutcomes that selection produces. (Of course, the importance\nof distinguishing process from outcome is not a novel insight; what is\nnovel here is its application to the problem of distinguishing drift\nfrom selection. The distinction has sometimes been rendered as\n\u201cprocess vs. product\u201d rather than \u201cprocess vs.\noutcome\u201d in the philosophical literature, but given the\nteleological and other misleading connotations of\n\u201cproduct\u201d, the term \u201coutcome\u201d is preferable\nand \u201cproduct\u201d should be avoided). Third, we should\ncharacterize drift and selection as processes rather than outcomes (as\nin the first of the three points). If we do these three things, then\ndrift and selection are conceptually distinct and the problem Beatty\nraises is dissolved; discriminate sampling processes where unlikely\noutcomes obtain are still selection processes. On this view, it is\nfurther acknowledged that it is possible for drift and selection to\nproduce the same outcomes, which helps explain the persistence of\nbiologists\u2019 debates over the relative importance of drift and\nselection without making them seem trivial (see Millstein 2002 for\nadditional discussion of Beatty\u2019s arguments).\n\nAnd what are these drift processes? They are the same physical\nindiscriminate sampling processes that Gulick, the Hagedoorns, Wright,\nand Fisher (and later, Kimura, who will be discussed further below)\nsought to characterize: the sampling of gametes in the formation of\nzygotes, the sampling of parents, the founding of new populations, and\nthe splitting of populations. (Note that this is not intended to be an\nexhaustive list). The outcomes are likewise those mentioned by\ndrift\u2019s founders: fluctuations of gene frequencies from one\ngeneration to the next, loss of variants from a population, and\nfixation of a type in a population. (Again, this is not an exhaustive\nlist). Each of these outcomes is affected by population size, as any\nindiscriminate sampling process is; smaller populations undergoing\ndrift tend to experience greater fluctuations in gene frequencies, a\nfaster loss of variants from the population, and faster fixation of\ntypes in a population. Thus, the Beatty/Hodge/Millstein account of\ndrift\u2014the Causal Process Account of Drift\u2014is one that is\ngrounded in the historical development of the term and in biological\npractice, with the philosopher\u2019s role being one of clarification\nand elaboration. Christopher Stephens (2004), Robert Northcott (2010),\nand Chris Haufe (2013) also seem to endorse the bare bones view of\ndrift as a sampling process, if not the Causal Process Account of\nDrift in all of its details.\n",
