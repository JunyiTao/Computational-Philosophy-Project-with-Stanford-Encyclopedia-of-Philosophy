    "main_text": "\n\nJury theorems are mathematical theorems about the ability of\ncollectives to make correct decisions. Several jury theorems carry the\noptimistic message that, in suitable circumstances, \u201ccrowds are\nwise\u201d: many individuals together (using, for instance, majority\nvoting) tend to make good decisions, outperforming fewer or just one\nindividual. Jury theorems form the technical core of epistemic\narguments for democracy, and provide probabilistic tools for reasoning\nabout the epistemic quality of collective decisions. The popularity of\njury theorems spans across various disciplines such as economics,\npolitical science, philosophy, and computer science.\n\nThis entry reviews and critically assesses a variety of jury theorems.\nIt first discusses Condorcet\u2019s initial jury theorem, and then\nprogressively introduces jury theorems with more appropriate premises\nand conclusions. It explains the philosophical foundations, and\nrelates jury theorems to diversity, deliberation, shared evidence,\nshared perspectives, and other phenomena. It finally connects jury\ntheorems to their historical background and to democratic theory,\nsocial epistemology, and social choice theory.\n",
