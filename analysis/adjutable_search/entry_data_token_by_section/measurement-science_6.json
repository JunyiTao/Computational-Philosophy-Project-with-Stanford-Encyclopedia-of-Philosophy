    "main_text": "Mathematical Theories of Measurement (\u201cMeasurement Theory\u201d) || Representational Theory of Measurement\n3.4 Representational Theory of Measurement\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century the two main lines of inquiry in\nmeasurement theory, the one dedicated to the empirical conditions of\nquantification and the one concerning the classification of scales,\nconverged in the work of Patrick Suppes (1951; Scott and Suppes 1958;\nfor historical surveys see Savage and Ehrlich 1992; Diez 1997a,b).\nSuppes\u2019 work laid the basis for the Representational Theory of\nMeasurement (RTM), which remains the most influential mathematical\ntheory of measurement to date (Krantz et al. 1971; Suppes et al. 1989;\nLuce et al. 1990). RTM defines measurement as the construction of\nmappings from empirical relational structures into numerical\nrelational structures (Krantz et al. 1971: 9). An empirical relational\nstructure consists of a set of empirical objects (e.g., rigid rods)\nalong with certain qualitative relations among them (e.g., ordering,\nconcatenation), while a numerical relational structure consists of a\nset of numbers (e.g., real numbers) and specific mathematical\nrelations among them (e.g., \u201cequal to or bigger than\u201d,\naddition). Simply put, a measurement scale is a many-to-one\nmapping\u2014a homomorphism\u2014from an empirical to a numerical\nrelational structure, and measurement is the construction of\n scales.[6]\n RTM goes into great detail in clarifying the assumptions underlying\nthe construction of different types of measurement scales. Each type\nof scale is associated with a set of assumptions about the qualitative\nrelations obtaining among objects represented on that type of scale.\nFrom these assumptions, or axioms, the authors of RTM derive the\nrepresentational adequacy of each scale type, as well as the family of\npermissible transformations making that type of scale unique. In this\nway RTM provides a conceptual link between the empirical basis of\nmeasurement and the typology of\n scales.[7]\n\nOn the issue of measurability, the Representational Theory takes a\nmiddle path between the liberal approach adopted by Stevens and the\nstrict emphasis on concatenation operations espoused by Campbell. Like\nCampbell, RTM accepts that rules of quantification must be grounded in\nknown empirical structures and should not be chosen arbitrarily to fit\nthe data. However, RTM rejects the idea that additive scales are\nadequate only when concatenation operations are available (Luce and\nSuppes 2004: 15). Instead, RTM argues for the existence of fundamental\nmeasurement operations that do not involve concatenation. The central\nexample of this type of operation is known as \u201cadditive conjoint\nmeasurement\u201d (Luce and Tukey 1964; Krantz et al. 1971:\n17\u201321 and Ch. 6\u20137). Here, measurements of two or more\ndifferent types of attribute, such as the temperature and pressure of\na gas, are obtained by observing their joint effect, such as the\nvolume of the gas. Luce and Tukey showed that by establishing certain\nqualitative relations among volumes under variations of temperature\nand pressure, one can construct additive representations of\ntemperature and pressure, without invoking any antecedent method of\nmeasuring volume. This sort of procedure is generalizable to any\nsuitably related triplet of attributes, such as the loudness,\nintensity and frequency of pure tones, or the preference for a reward,\nit size and the delay in receiving it (Luce and Suppes 2004: 17). The\ndiscovery of additive conjoint measurement led the authors of RTM to\ndivide fundamental measurement into two kinds: traditional measurement\nprocedures based on concatenation operations, which they called\n\u201cextensive measurement\u201d, and conjoint or\n\u201cnonextensive\u201d fundamental measurement. Under this new\nconception of fundamentality, all the traditional physical attributes\ncan be measured fundamentally, as well as many psychological\nattributes (Krantz et al. 1971: 502\u20133).\n",
