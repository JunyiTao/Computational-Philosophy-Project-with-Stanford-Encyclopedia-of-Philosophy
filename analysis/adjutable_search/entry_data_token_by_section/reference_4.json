    "main_text": "Proper Names || Names with Multiple Bearers\n2.3 Names with Multiple Bearers\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve generally proceeded as though names were \nunivocal\u2014that is, as if only one person or thing can bear a given name.\nBut that hardly seems right. As we already saw, a name like\n\u2018David Cameron\u2019 would seem to apply equally well to the\nformer British Prime Minister and to anyone else who\u2019s parents decided\nto call them this, regardless of their politics; likewise, once I\u2019ve\nnamed my cat \u2018Napoleon\u2019, it would seem that the name\n\u2018Napoleon\u2019 can be used equally well to talk about either\nthe greatest of French generals or, alternatively, my cat. Classical\ndescriptivists have no real trouble accounting for this, since each\ntime a name is used, its reference is essentially fixed anew by\nwhatever description the speaker happens to have in mind. In other\nwords, according to the descriptivist, it is really only a matter of\nhappenstance that uses of names ever co-refer. That might seem a\nrather large bullet to bite. On the other hand, once we move away from\nclassical descriptivism, explaining how names can refer to different\nindividuals in different circumstances becomes far more\nchallenging.\n\nConsider a descriptivist in the Strawsonian mold, one for whom an\nutterance of the name \u2018N\u2019 refers in accord with\nthe plurality of the beliefs of the relevant experts. What are we to\ndo with a name like \u2018David Cameron\u2019 then, which sometimes\nrefers to the former British Prime Minister and sometimes to our\nmutual friend? We cannot simply aggregate all the relevant beliefs\nassociated with this name, considered as an orthographic or\nphonological form, and then see who or what the plurality of those\nbeliefs picks out. For that would leave us only ever able to use the\nname to refer to one or the other of these David Camerons, and that\nhardly seems like the right thing to say. It seems, therefore, that a\ndescriptivist of this sort will have to think about names in some more\nfine-grained manner. Yet this will not prove easy. She cannot simply\ngo back to appealing to the information the speaker happens to have to\ndo the job\u2014for we can easily imagine someone who has names for\nboth David Camerons in her vocabulary, and yet lacks sufficient\ninformation to distinguish the one from the other.\n\nSimilar issues arise for the Millian. Here, however, some concrete\nproposals have been floated. For instance, David Kaplan (1990) has\nargued that, against all appearances, names really do only have one\nreferent apiece. In fact, Kaplan suggests that we should think of\nnames as individuated, in part, by their referents. In other words, on\nKaplan\u2019s view, one cannot simply \u2018read off\u2019 which name has\nbeen used from its overt phonological or orthographic form. Rather,\nKaplan posits that there are any number of names all written and\npronounced \u2018David Cameron\u2019. While each of these names is\nwritten and pronounced identically, each refers to a different person.\nThe question now becomes: what determines which name a\nspeaker has used in a given context? Kaplan suggests that the answer\nto this question has to do with the speaker\u2019s mental states, and in\nparticular with the speaker\u2019s intention to talk about one or another\nindividual. In effect, Kaplan takes it that hearing a name leaves us\nwith a mental trace, a mental analogue of a linguistic name, that\ndirectly refers to some particular individual. By looking to see who\nor what that trace refers to, we come to know the referential\nproperties of the utterance or inscription being used to express this\nmental trace. In a word, on Kaplan\u2019s theory, names are first and\nforemost a mental phenomenon. We do, of course, use certain marks and\nsounds to externalize the mental traces, or mental names, that we\nacquire from each other in the course of things; linguistic names, in\nthe sense of something that will bear referential features, are\ntypes of uses of a particular phonological or orthographic\nform to externalize the use of a mental name to refer in thought.\n\nKaplan\u2019s theory has some rather odd consequences, however. For\ninstance, it turns out that no two people actually ever share a \nname\u2014for a name comes complete with its referential features.\nKaplan suggests that what people share are not names but rather some\ncommon aspects of how their names tend to be externalized. In other\nwords, for Kaplan, what it is to share a name with someone else is for\nboth of your names to belong to the same class of phonological and\northographic forms. Kaplan calls these \u2018generic names\u2019, as\nopposed to the \u2018common currency names\u2019 which, for him, are\nthe bearers of semantic properties like reference.\n\nFinding themselves dissatisfied with Kaplan\u2019s proposal here, other\ndirect reference theorists have opted for different responses\nto the problem of names with multiple bearers. For instance, both\nFrancois Recanati (1997) and Michael Pelczar and Joe Rainsbury (1998)\nhave suggested that names ought to be treated on the model of\nindexicals, a sort of term that we will consider in more detail\nshortly. Briefly though, the suggestion runs: there is one and only\none name \u2018David Cameron\u2019, but context makes clear to which\nindividual a particular utterance of this name refers. In effect, the\nproposal preserves something of the causal theory\u2014by allowing\nthat baptisms and passings-on of names are the right sort of thing to\ndetermine the set of possible referents associated with a name at any\ngiven time\u2014while appealing to some further feature of the\ncontext to do the work of selecting an individual from this set. One\nlingering problem is that, in contrast to the pure indexicals like\n\u2018I\u2019 or \u2018here\u2019, it is less than clear what\naspect of the context might serve to make this selection. Things get\nworse still once we consider contexts in which multiple people bearing\nthe same name are all present and being talked about in the course of\na single utterance (e.g. \u201cDavid was Prime Minister, now retired\nin disgrace, whereas David is a plumber in good\n standing.\u201d).[6]\n One possibility would be to posit that proper names function more\nlike the demonstratives \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 than\nthey do any of the pure indexicals. Alternatively, one might posit\nthat proper names themselves denote only the property of bearing the\nrelevant name, but that singular reference emerges when proper names\nare supplemented with a determiner like \u2018that\u2019 or\n\u2018the\u2019 to form a determiner phrase like \u2018that\nDavid\u2019 or \u2018the Michelle\u2019 (see Burge (1973) and Graff\nFara (2015), respectively; see also the entry on\n names\n for more on such \u2018predicativist\u2019 views). In languages\nlike English, of course, these determiners would turn out to be mostly\nsilent. Still, one might take it that positing silent determiners is a\nprice worth paying for coherent story about the reference of names (or\ndefinite noun phrases containing names, as the case may be) that is\ncompatible with the claim that two individuals can genuinely share a\nname.\n\nAs should be clear, to better understand these last few proposals\nwe\u2019ll first need to get clearer on how reference is supposed to work\nfor each of the various terms and phrases just appealed to: pure\nindexicals, impure indexicals, complex demonstratives, and definite\ndescriptions. Over the next few sections, we\u2019ll work to fill in these\ngaps.\n",
