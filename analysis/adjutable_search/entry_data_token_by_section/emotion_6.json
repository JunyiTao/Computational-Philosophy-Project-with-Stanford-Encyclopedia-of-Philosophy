The Hybrid Evaluative-Feeling Tradition in Recent Philosophy\n\nWe mentioned earlier that a popular response to the critiques received\nby philosophical judgmentalism has been the alternate cognitions\nstrategy, intended to better account for their intentionality,\ndifferentiation, motivational power, and phenomenology, as well as\ntheir potential recalcitrance.\n\nThis has led to a gradual convergence of the Evaluative and Feeling\nTraditions, with the former now identifying emotions as evaluative\nperceptions with a distinctive phenomenology and the latter\nidentifying emotions as evaluative feelings with a distinctive\nintentionality. As a result, the distinction between evaluative (or\ncognitivist) theories and feeling theories is increasingly blurred,\nwith most of the dominant accounts in the philosophy of emotions now\nqualifying as hybrids.\n",
