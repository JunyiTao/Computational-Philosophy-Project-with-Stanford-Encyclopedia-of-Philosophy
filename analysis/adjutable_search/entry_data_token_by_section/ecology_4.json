Community Ecology\n\n\nCommunity ecology consists of models of interacting species, forming\nan ecological \u201ccommunity,\u201d in which each species is\ntreated as a unit. The appropriate definition of\n\u201ccommunity\u201d has been widely debated among ecologists and\nphilosophers; what is being given here is an interactive\n definition.[33]\n Alternative options include defining community by mere geographical\nassociation of species at one extreme, or by requiring a good deal of\nstructure in the interactions at the other, making the community\nanalogous to an organism. The interactive definition given above is\nattractive for two reasons: (a) mere association leaves little of\ntheoretical or practical interest to study, while requiring some\nspecified elevated levels of interaction introduces an unnecessary\narbitrariness in a definition of community; and (b) the former would\nmake any association of species a\n community[34]\n whereas the latter would typically introduce so much structure that\nvirtually no association would constitute a community.\n\n\nCommunity models can be conveniently represented as\nloop,\n diagrams[35]\n generalized graphs that have each species as a vertex and edges\nconnecting these vertices when the species interact. The edges\nindicate whether the relevant species benefit or are harmed by the\ninteraction, that is, whether they tend to increase or decrease in\nabundance, by an interaction. See Figure 3:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Structure of an Ecological Community\n\n This is the loop diagram of a community of three species (from Diamond\n[1975a], p. 435). Species X1 and\nX2 both prey upon the resource species\nX3. There is resource coupling and competitive\nexclusion. It is assumed that all three species are self-regulating.\n\u2192: positive interaction; \n : negative interaction. The\ncoefficients measure the strength of the interactions.\n \n\n As with population ecology, what is of most interest is are the\nchanges in a community over time. This brings us to one of the most\ninteresting\u2014and one of the most vexed\u2014questions of\necology: the relationship between diversity and stability. A deeply\nrooted intuition among ecologists has been that diversity begets\nstability. If this claim is true, it has significant consequences for\nbiodiversity conservation\u2014see\n conservation biology.[36]\n\n\nWhat confuses this question from the very beginning, is the\nmultiplicity of possible definitions of \u201cdiversity\u201d and\n\u201cstability.\u201d There are probably no better instances of\nformalization indeterminacy in any scientific context. For instance, a\nreasonable first attempt to define diversity would be to equate the\ndiversity of a community to the number of species in it, that is, its\nspecies \u201crichness.\u201d The trouble is that there is ample\nreason to doubt that richness captures all that is relevant about\ndiversity, whether or not we are interested in only its relationship\nto stability. Consider two communities, the first consisting of 50%\nspecies A and 50% species B, and a second consisting\nof 99.9 % species A and 0.1% species B. Both\ncommunities have the same richness because they both have two species;\nhowever, there is a clear sense in which the first is more\ndiverse\u2014or less homogeneous\u2014than the second. Moreover, the\ndifference is likely to be relevant. If diversity does beget stability\nin these communities, then that stability must be a result some\ninteraction between the two species. If species B comprises\nonly 0.1% of the community, the scope for such interaction is\ntypically much less than if it comprises\n 50%.[37]\n Diversity must mean more than richness. There\nhave been several attempts to define and quantify diversity beyond\nrichness; one of them is described in Box 2.\n\n\nBox 2. Measures of Diversity\nEcologists often distinguish between three concepts\nof biodiversity, usually using species as the appropriate unit to\nmeasure diversity: (i) \u201c\u03b1-diversity\u201d, the diversity\nwithin a community/place (MacArthur 1965); (ii)\n\u201c\u03b2-diversity\u201d, the diversity between\ncommunities/places (Whittaker 1972, 1975); and (iii)\n\u201c\u03b3-diversity\u201d, the diversity between regions, that\nis, \u03b2-diversity on a larger spatial scale (Whittaker 1972).\n\n Though many measures of \u03b1-diversity have been proposed over\nthe years, MacArthur's (1965) proposal to use the Shannon measure of\ninformation content in a communication process (Shannon 1948) has\nremained the most popular (though not universally accepted). \nAccording to this measure, the \u03b1-diversity of a community\nwith n species is given by\n\n\n\n\u03b1 = \n\u2212\n\nn\n\u2211 \ni=1\n\npi ln pi\n\n\n\nwhere pi is the frequency of\nthe i-th species.  This is a measure of the diversity of a\ncommunity in the same way that the Shannon measure of information\ncontent is a measure of the variety in a signal. \nTurning to the two communities discussed in the text, a simple\ncalculation shows that the diversity of the first is given by \u03b1\n= 0.693, while the diversity of the second is given by \u03b1 =\n0.008, verifying the intuition that the first is more diverse than the\nsecond.\n\n\n Unfortunately, though, there has been little success in tying these\nconcepts to theoretical rules or even empirical\n generalizations.[38]\n (For a discussion of the related concept of biodiversity, see\nthe entry on \n biodiversity.)\n\n\nStability turns out to be even more difficult to\n define.[39]\n At one extreme, stability can be defined to require that a community\nbe truly in equilibrium: it does not change in either its composition\n(the abundances of every component)or in the interactions among these\ncomponents. At the practical level, this definition faces the problem\nof vacuous scope: almost no natural community satisfies such a strict\nrequirement of equilibrium. Moreover, almost every community\nexperiences significant disturbances. With this in mind, stability has\nbeen variously explicated using a system's response to disturbances or\nits tendency not to change beyond specified limits even in the absence\nof disturbance. Boxes 3 and 4 (see below) list some of the definitions of stability that\nhave been in vogue and how they may be measured in the\n field.[40]\n\n\nHow do any of these measures of stability relate to diversity? The\nonly honest answer is that no one is sure. If diversity is interpreted\nas richness, traditionally, it was commonly assumed that diversity is\npositively correlated with at least persistence. However, there was\nnever much hard evidence supporting this assumption. If stability is\ninterpreted as a return to equilibrium, mathematical models that\nshould answer questions about stability are easy to construct but hard\nto analyze unless the system is already close to equilibrium. This is\ncalled local stability analysis. The most systematic analyses\nperformed so far give no straightforward positive\n correlation.[48]\n It was once believed that natural ecosystems are usually at\nequilibrium (the \u201cbalance of\n nature\u201d).[49]\n But ample empirical data now suggests that this assumption is almost\nnever correct: natural ecosystems are usually far from\n equilibrium.[50]\n Moreover, if natural selection between species occurs during the\ntransition to equilibrium, equilibrium communities will be less rich\nthan those that are yet to reach equilibrium. On short time scales\n(short enough to make speciation unlikely), selection between species\nthat utilize the same resources (that is, they occupy the same\n\u201cniche\u201d) will lead to the exclusion of the less fit by the\nmore fit through \u201ccompetitive\n exclusion.\u201d[51]\n The eventual equilibrium community, one in which selection would no\nlonger be acting, the (controversially) so-called \u201cclimax\ncommunity,\u201d is necessarily less rich than those that temporally\npreceded it.\nBox 3.

Meanwhile, Pfisterer and Schmid have produced equally\ncompelling empirical evidence that richness is inversely correlated\nwith stability, interpreted as resilience and\n resistance.[54]\n Much remains to be found out. All that is certain is that McCann's\nconfident 2000 verdict in favor of a positive diversity-stability\nrelationship was\n premature.[55]\n Note, finally, that virtually no theoretical or practical exploration\nof this question has used concepts of diversity other than\nrichness. At least at the theoretical level, this remains an open\nfield for philosophers. (Clear formal results would not go unnoticed\nby ecologists.)\n\n\nWithin community ecology, philosophers have lately paid considerable\nattention to the theory of island biogeography and the controversies\nsurrounding its relevance for the design of networks of biological\n reserves.[56]\n The basis for this theory is the species-area relation: larger areas\nof the same habitat type usually contain more species than smaller\n ones.[57]\n Thus there is a monotonic relationship between species richness and\narea. But, what is the form of this relationship?  Moreover, what is\nthe mechanism responsible for it? In spite of sporadic work over\nalmost an entire century, these remain open questions. Perhaps the\nmost popular answer to the first question, but one that gives no hint\nof the operative mechanism, is a power law going back to\n Arrhenius:[58]\nS = cAz, where S is the\nnumber of species, A the area, and c and z\nconstants. This power law represents what is often called the\n\u201cspecies-area curve.\u201d Turning to the question of\nmechanisms, traditionally, the species-area relation was attributed to\nenvironmental heterogeneity. Larger areas were presumed to have\ngreater habitat heterogeneity and could, therefore, host a larger\nnumber of species each with its own specific needs. In recent years\nthe relation is more often attributed to the belief that larger areas\ncan support larger populations of any\n species.[59]\n Thus fewer populations are likely to become extinct in a larger area\nthan a smaller one in any specified time interval.  Consequently, on\nthe average, more species are likely to be present in larger areas\nthan smaller ones even if both started with the same species\nrichness.\n\n\nWhether the species-area curve (rather than the mere qualitative\nrelation) has any empirical support remains a matter of\n contention.[60]\n In the 1950s, Preston was a strong advocate of the power law model\nwhich he believed to be the result of a dynamic equilibrium of the\nexchange of species between isolated habitat\n patches.[61]\n (The same idea had been worked out in some detail much earlier by\nMunroe but did not receive any\n attention.)[62]\n Preston's work was extended by MacArthur and Wilson to construct the\ntheory of island\n biogeography.[63]\n According to this theory, the number of species in islands with the\nsame habitat (at the same latitude) depends only on the size of the\nisland and its isolation. There is a dynamic equilibrium in the sense\nthat this number does not change over time though there is a turnover\nof species which changes the composition of the\n community.[64]\n The equilibrium is supposed to be a result of a balance between\nimmigration and extinction. The immigration rate varies inversely with\nthe degree of isolation while the extinction rate decreases with\narea. Thus, this theory incorporates the second mechanism for the\nspecies-area relation mentioned in the last paragraph. While some\ninitial experimental evidence seemed to support the theory, by the\nmid-1970s its status had become\n controversial.[65]\n\n\nNevertheless, in the 1970s, island biogeography began to be viewed as\na model for biological reserves which, by being surrounded by\nanthropogenically transformed lands, were supposed to be similar to\nislands\u2014see the entry on\n conservation biology.\n The initially prevalent view, based on island biogeography theory,\nwas that reserves should be as large as\n possible.[66]\n In particular, one conclusion drawn from island biogeography theory\nwas that \u201c[i]n cases where one large area is infeasible, it must\nbe realized that several smaller ones, adding up to the same total\narea as the single large one, are not biogeographically equal to it:\nthey will tend to support a smaller species\n total.\u201d[67]\n Though this conclusion was incorporated into the design of the World\nConservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation\nof Nature, there was almost no data that ever supported\n it.[68]\n It was also challenged by Simberloff and Abele on both\ntheoretical and empirical\n grounds.[69]\n Among other things they pointed out that several small reserves may\nincrease the probability of the survival of species in the face of\nenvironmental stochasticity, for instance, random catastrophes such as\noutbreaks of infectious disease. This objection sparked the SLOSS\n(Single Large or Several Small) debate about the design of biological\nreserve networks. The SLOSS debate dominated discussions of reserve\nnetwork design for about a decade. Meanwhile the species-area curve\nalso began to generate serious skepticism. Soul\u00e9 et\nal. predicted in 1979 from a model based on the species-area\ncurve that the Serengeti National Park of Tanzania will lose 50% of\nits large mammals (15 ungulate species) in 250\n years.[70]\n However, once Western and Ssemakula incorporated habitat diversity\ndata in 1981, it appeared that only 1 such species will go\n extinct.[71]\n There are many other such examples and it is hard not to sympathize\nwith Zimmerman and Bierregard who observe that, besides the ecological\ntruism that species richness increases with area, there is little of\nvalue in the species-area curve (and the theory of island\n biogeography).[72]\n In the context of biodiversity conservation, the relevance of the\nspecies-area curve, and island biogeography, has never been\nuncontroversially accepted. Important early criticism of the use of\nisland biogeography theory for reserve network design came from\nMargules and several collaborators in\n 1982.[73]\n They pointed out that the theory was yet to be empirically\nestablished in the field, that biological reserves were not very\nsimilar to islands because landscapes between reserves were not\ncompletely uninhabitable by the species in the reserves (unlike the\ncase of oceans separating islands), that habitats are largely\nheterogeneous rather than homogeneous (as assumed in the theory), and\nthat species richness should not be the only criterion used to select\nreserves. By 1986, it became clear that there would be no winner in\nthe SLOSS debate; since then there has been no unequivocal role for\nisland biogeography theory to play in the design of biodiversity\nreserve\n networks.[74]\n (For more on these issues, see the entry on \n conservation biology.)\n",
