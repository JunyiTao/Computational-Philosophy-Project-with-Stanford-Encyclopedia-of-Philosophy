Theory of sense perception\n\nTelesio rejected the traditional concept of sense organs, replacing it\nwith a mechanistic explanation of sense perception (DRN books\nV\u2013VII). In his opinion, to speak of sense organs is\ninappropriate, as the so-called sense organs are nothing else than\n\u201cparts of the body which are either more subtle or soft than\nothers, or perforated and open. One should not believe in the\nslightest that they are made thus in order to offer some capacity or\nsupport of perceiving to the sensitive soul (which seems to be the\nduty of organs), but in order to provide an easy and open entry to the\nforces of external things and to those things themselves.\u201d (DRN\nbook I, ch.VI; vol. I, p. 68). What is perceived are not the forms or\nspecies of things as the Aristotelians believed, but impulses\nof light and air (DRN book V, ch. VIII; vol. II, 254; for the\nrejection of species see DRN book VII, ch. XXX\u2013XXXIII\nagainst the Aristotelian and ch. XVIII\u2013XXIX against the Galenic\ntheory; Telesio\u2019s rejection of species was taken up by\nHobbes, Leviathan book I, ch. I \u201cDe sensu\u201d). As\nthe sense of touch provides the most narrow contact between outer\nobject and sensing spirit, it assumes the role of the primary sense,\nwhich was traditionally identified with the sense of vision (DRN book\nVII, ch. IX, vol. III, p. 34.) The informatio theory being\nrejected, Telesio comes close to a neuronal explanation of sense\nperception, which is a mechanical process arising from the transfer of\ntactile impressions through the nerves to the brain. It is the spirit\nresiding in the brain which experiences nervous dilatations and\ncontractions, and which judges these sensations according to the basic\nscheme of pleasure and pain, giving out corresponding reactions like\nmoving towards something or avoiding contact (DRN book VII ch.\nII\u2013V). Strictly speaking, sense perception is a sensation of\nsensing (sensus sensus) which takes place in the brain:\n\u201cSense perception can only be the perception of the activities\nof things and impulses in the air, and can only consist of the\nperception of [the spirit\u2019s] own passions, transformations and\nmovements, particularly the latter. Indeed, the spirit perceives them\nbecause he perceives that it is affected by them, that it is being\nchanged and moved.\u201d (Vol. III, p. 6)\n\nIn his explanation of sense perception Telesio comes close to the\nDemocritan theory which he combines with the basic Stoic notion of\nconservatio sui, a key term in Telesio\u2019s philosophy. Pleasure\nis identified with the sensation of self-preservation, pain is the\nsensation of destruction (DRN book VII, ch. III; vol. III, p. 10). In\nthis, as well as in his theory of knowledge, Telesio seems to follow\nGirolamo Fracastoro\u2019s explanation of sense perception and\nunderstanding given in the closing chapters of De sympathia et\nantipathia rerum and in the epistemological treatise Turrius\nsive de intellectione.\n",
