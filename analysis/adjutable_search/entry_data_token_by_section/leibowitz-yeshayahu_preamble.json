    "main_text": "\n\nYeshayahu Leibowitz (1903\u20131994) was one of the most outspoken\nand controversial twentieth century Jewish thinkers and Israeli public\nintellectuals. Once termed \u201cthe conscience of\n Israel\u201d[1]\n by his childhood contemporary from Riga, Sir Isaiah Berlin,\nLeibowitz\u2019s thought is founded on a far-reaching theocentrism\nthat allows him to combine a commitment to Orthodox Jewish practice\nwith a stripped-down definition of Jewish faith that yields a\nradically naturalistic theology \u2013 if, indeed, what is left can\nbear the burden of the term \u201ctheology\u201d at all. But the\ninfluence of this theocentric commitment spreads far beyond the\nconfines of his views on religious faith. It is the ultimate source of\nhis unyielding criticism of the rabbinic establishment in Israel, and\nwhat \u2013 \u201cin the face of so much pressure to be sensible, to\nbe realistic, not to let the side down\u201d as Berlin (1983, 18) put\nit \u2013 was seen at the time as a highly controversial stance\nregarding Israeli policy towards the territories occupied since the\nSix Day war.\n",
