    "main_text": "The Resurgence of Empiricism || Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory\n3.2 Bayesian approaches\n\n\nEven at the height of Chomsky\u2019s influence, it was clear that\nthe strength of the Nativist position rested, to a great extent, on the\nweakness of the Empiricist alternative. The central argument from\nthe Poverty of the Stimulus was that Empiricism had failed to make\nits case, and that the Nativist hypothesis was therefore more\nplausible. But it was implicit in this dialectic that if\na more powerful Empiricist learning theory were developed, it could\nchange the terms of the debate. Furthermore, Empiricists argued\nthat there had to be a stronger general learning theory\nbecause learning theory as developed up until that time did not have\nthe resources to account for much learning that was plainly\nbased on experience (Harman 1967; Putnam 1967). Some would argue that these Empiricist\nhopes for a more powerful learning theory have been realized. Learning theory has advanced\nsignificantly, especially in the last decade, and Empiricism can now\ndraw upon new resources; specifically, learning algorithms based on\nBayes\u2019 Theorem. The power of Bayesianism raises the\npossibility that the earlier Poverty of the Stimulus arguments\nunderestimated what could be learned from experience by general\nlearning mechanisms.\n\n\n\u2018Bayesianism\u2019 is a general term for a range of\nsophisticated statistical methods, algorithms, and tools that draw upon Bayes\u2019\nTheorem/Rule, which tells us how to revise our beliefs given new\ninformation; that is, how to choose the best of a set of alternative\nhypotheses given new data. The calculation requires (i) the prior\nprobability of the data, (ii) the probability of the data given the\nhypothesis, and (iii) the prior probability of the\n hypothesis.[27]\n\nThe relevance of Bayes\u2019 Theorem to Cognitive\nScience. Bayesianism is in its origins a normative theory of\nwhat one ought to believe under specific epistemic\ncircumstances, and as such it has been applied extensively in\nunderstanding theory confirmation in the sciences. It first came\nto the fore in the cognitive sciences as an ideal against which one\ncould measure human irrationality. Kahneman and Tversky\n(1972) famously showed that ordinary reasoners typically fall short of\nBayesian standards when they are asked to decide the bearing of\nevidence on hypotheses, in part because they misjudge the relevance of\nthe prior probability of the hypotheses. But in recent years, Bayesian methodologies have become a unifying framework for analyzing all aspects of cognition that can be represented as inference under uncertainty.  For example, \nBayesian ideas have been successfully applied to the processing\nunderlying perception\u2014especially the visual system (Knill\n& Richards 1996; Rao et al. 2002). In visual perception,\na pattern of light hits the eye (the proximal stimulus), and the visual\nsystem needs to determine the nature of the visual scene in the\nenvironment (the distal stimulus) that caused that pattern. The\nproximal stimulus is compatible with a number of different distal\nstimuli. So the system faces something like the\nunder-determination problem that a scientist faces. Both must\nselect one view about what the world is like on the basis of\ninformation that still leaves other possibilities open. It turns\nout that Bayesian methods have been very successful at modeling how the\nvisual system resolves these uncertainties.\n\n\nThe visual system gets an image on the retina (D), and must\ndetermine what the real-world scene is like (H). The\nimage is compatible with many different possible scenes, but the visual\nsystem is very good at overcoming this uncertainty and reliably settles\non the most likely scene. In Bayesian terms, the visual system\nmust do this calculation:\n\n\\[ \n\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Scene}\\mid\\text{Image}) =\n\\frac{\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Image}\\mid\\text{Scene})\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Scene})}{\\mathrm{P}(\\text{Image})}\n\\]\n\n\n\nConsider this (again simplified) example, drawn from Scholl\n2005. In Figure 1, the circles are ambiguous; they can be either\nconvex bumps or concave depressions. Viewers normally see (a) as\nconvex and (b) as concave, (but if the display is turned upside down, the\nproperties are reversed).\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe fact that we see these as we do can be explained in Bayesian\nterms. To figure out the most likely scene/source of (a), the visual\nsystem must assign a probability to the hypotheses \\(H_2\\) (that the circle\nin a is convex) and to \\(H_2\\) (that it is concave). One key assumption\nthe visual system makes is that the scene in both (a) and (b) is\nilluminated by a single light source coming from overhead. So if\nthe bottom of the circle is in shadow, we tend to see it as convex; if\nthe top, we tend to see it as concave. When we look at\n(a), this assumption about the light source translates into the\nprior probability of \\(H_1\\) being higher than the prior probability of\n\\(H_2\\). So the priors in this case give us an antecedent ordering of\nthe hypothesis space (here we ignore other hypotheses that could\naccount for the image), and the visual system settles on (a) as\nconvex.\n\n\nBayesian approaches are appealing because they provide a natural way\nto solve the problem that troubles theories, like Connectionism, that\nare built on associationist lines. Associationist learning is\nbottom-up. It depends on keeping track of correlations in the\nstream of experience and slowly modulating expectations on the basis of\nthese correlations. But as we noted earlier, humans and animals\nlearn about the world very quickly, and on the basis of a very small\nnumber of exposures and interventions. A child hears the word\n\u2018horse\u2019 applied to a few instances (and probably\nhears stray utterances of the word too) and reliably learns the\nextension of the term (Markman 1989). A rat made sick by a food\none time, will not eat food with that smell again (Garcia et\nal 1955). These \u2018fast-mappings\u2019 are a problem\nfor Associationist models. But they are more easily accommodated\nin Bayesian models, which essentially quantify the role of background\nknowledge\u2014the top-down contribution\u2014in the fixation of\nbelief. If the rat already knows, as part of its background\nknowledge\u2014its \u2018factory settings\u2019, so to\nspeak\u2014that when it comes to foods, smell is an indicator of\nedibility, then single-case learning is less mysterious. The\nprior probability of hypotheses linking edibility to smell may be\nantecedently set as very high, and hypotheses linking edibility to\norientation may be set as very low. So one association between\nsick-making food \\(f\\) and smell \\(s\\) will be enough for the rat to\n\u2018adopt the hypothesis\u2019 that \\(f\\) and \\(s\\) are regularly\nlinked. In contrast, if sick-making food \\(f\\) is always in a\nparticular orientation \\(o\\), the rat may have a hard time making the\nconnection even if it may be sensitive to orientations in other\ncontexts. Similarly, if the child comes to the word-learning task\nwith the assumption that new words most likely pick out unfamiliar\nextensions\u2014again, with this assumption implemented in the\npriors\u2014then her job is made easier. Bayes\u2019 Theorem\ngives us a way to factor in this top-down background\n knowledge.[28]\n\n\nThe key issue in considering the bearing of Bayesianism on the\nNativist-Empiricist controversy is the\n priors.[29]\nWhere do they come from? If we are talking about simple, repeatable events like coin flips, the priors are a\nmatter of well-defined relative frequencies given by probability\ntheory. But the prior in the concave-convex case (which was\nchosen to highlight this point) seems to involve domain-specific facts\nabout light and shadow, and their relation to the shape of objects.\nScholl 2005 argues that the priors here are innate, and many\nscientists studying visual perception would agree. We don\u2019t\nlearn from experience that the objects in our perceptual world\nwill typically have overhead illumination. Rather, this is one of\nthe \u2018factory settings\u2019 of the visual system. As\nKersten (2004) puts it (speaking more generally): \u2018the priors are\nin the genes\u2019. Ullman (1979) argues that the same may well\nhold for the general constraints relating the rigidity of objects to\nfacts about motion. The view that the illumination constraint is\ninnate is also supported by the fact that chickens reared in an\nabnormal illuminated-from-below environment still react as we do to\nstimuli (a) and (b) (Hershberger 1970). So we have evidence that this\nprior can be innate.\n\n\nLet us assume that there are significant innate priors that operate\nin perceptual processing. Does this score points for the Nativist\nposition in general? In one way it does, because it is in line\nwith the basic Nativist theme that humans are tailored for their\nnatural environment. But in another sense, the Empiricist might\ndownplay the importance of this kind of Perceptual Nativism for the\nlarger debate. Empiricists have always taken it for granted that\nwe perceive as we do, in large part, because of our\nbiological-psychological nature. The traditional Empiricist focus\nhas usually been on that part of our understanding that goes beyond\nwhat we actually perceive. Its main claim is that anything that\ngoes beyond what we perceive is constructed out of what\nwe\u2019ve perceived by domain-general\nprinciples. So even if (some of) the priors involved in Bayesian\nmodels of perceptual processing are innate, the more critical arena for\nthe Nativist is domain-specific cognitive processing,\nto which we now turn. Nativists would expect that the best\nBayesian models of cognitive processing would have to incorporate\ninnate priors that reflect domain-specific knowledge.\nEmpiricists would expect that domain-specific priors are themselves\nlearnable by Bayesian methods from experience plus domain-general\nconstraints on learning.\n\n\nWe do not yet know enough to settle these questions, but they are\nnow beginning to be addressed. Most recently, a number of\ntheorists have used Bayesian techniques to model not just low-level\nperceptual processing but also aspects of higher-order cognitive\nprocesses. Areas of current research include concept learning\n(Tenenbaum 1999), word learning (Xu 2007), and causal reasoning\n(Griffiths & Tenenbaum 2005; Griffiths et al. 2011), and the\nlist is\n growing.[30]\nContemporary research on the application of Bayesian techniques\nto higher-level cognition has generally ignored the battle lines of the\nNativist-Empiricist debate. The real interest is in the\npossibility of developing statistical techniques that, as Tenenbaum et al 2006 puts it, \u201cintegrate bottom-up and top-down\ninfluences.\u201d (For a very useful state of the art in Statistical learning along with concrete suggestions about deploying top-down information in such models, see Lake et al, forthcoming.)  We already have sophisticated statistical\nanalyses of the bottom-up part; the perceptual phenomena. The\nchallenge is to develop quantitative representations and analyses of\nthe levels of top-down background knowledge that operate in particular\ndomains. In section 2, for instance, we considered as part of the\nchild\u2019s background information his theory of mind.\nIt was on the basis of this theory that the child could develop a\nstructural analysis of a situation in terms of agents, beliefs, goals,\nhelp/hindrance, and so on. But the information contained in such\na theory and the structural analyses of particular situations that this\ntheory makes available, cannot yet be integrated into Bayesian\nstatistical analyses. The challenge for Bayesians is to develop\nways to recast the top-down elements and the analyses they make\navailable in quantitative terms. Only then will we be in a position to address\nwhether and to what extent top-down information is learned or\ninnate.\n\n\nWe can use the case of language understanding, a well-studied area\nand arguably a Nativist stronghold, to illustrate how these Bayesian\ngoals might be achieved. The phenomenon is familiar: you hear a\nsentence \\(S_1\\) as having a specific meaning. The theoretical\napproach mirrors the vision case: \\(S_1\\) (as auditorily processed) is\ncompatible with a number of competing structural representations, but your parser\nsomehow chooses the best one: \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\). The Bayesian says\nthat the parser is able to do this because it can do a statistical analysis\nthat integrates bottom-up and top-down information. In this case,\nthe bottom-up element is \\(S_1\\). But the range of possible\nstructured representations the parser can select from is top-down\ninformation, as is the algorithm that chooses \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\)\nover other candidates. The problem: how to assign a prior\nprobability to a complex structured representation like \\(\\mathrm{sr}(S_1)'\\)\n(for instance, a syntactic tree)\u2014a probability that depends on the probability\nassigned to the sub-elements. We know how to assign the prior\nprobability of a series of heads for a fair coin. But the question comes up again: how do we\nassign a prior probability to a linguistic representation, or to a\ncomplex visual scene, or to a complicated representation of the goals,\nroles, and perceptual beliefs of a player in one of the Theory of Mind\nscenarios? The events are more complex, the\nrepresentations of the events are therefore more complex, and the\nhypothesis space is more complex (Chater et al. 2006).\n\n\nIn the language case, the Bayesian can hope to draw on a good deal\nof what contemporary linguists have already achieved in understanding\nthe structures underlying sentence comprehension, and some\ncomputational linguists are beginning to merge such analyses with\nprobability theory (for instance, Chater & Manning 2006).\nBut even here, the problem of finding the best structure to assign to\nan input is daunting. As Chater et al. 2006 puts it:\n\n\u201cMore challenging is inferring representational structures over\nwhich parameters are optimized. One problem is that the space of\npossible structures is often large and discontinuous; a second is that\na direct application of probabilistic methods would involve assessing\neach structure by integrating a prior over its parameters, which seems\ncomputationally prohibitive; a third is that structures appear to be\nconstrained in potentially highly abstract ways.\u201d \n\n\nIn the case of theory of mind, on the other hand, we don\u2019t yet have\ndeveloped theories about the relevant structures (but see the related\nwork on causality collected in Gopnik & Schulz 2007). So it is\nonly if Bayesians can get a handle on these representational and\nstatistical problems, that they will be able to attack our\nquestion: how is the space of such structures generated in the first\nplace? Is there innate domain-specific information at work or is there\na Bayesian hierarchy, a two-level-up Bayesian account that explains\nhow this one-level-up information is acquired (that is, a Bayesian\nlearning-theoretic account that explains why the child represents\nlinguistic input, for example, using tree structures, but integers in\nterms of a very different linear structure; for further discussion see\nTenenbaum et al. 2011).\n\n\nSo, for example, children might know that animals are arranged in a\ntaxonomy of a specific sort, and this prior background knowledge helps\nthem learn about animals. But how do they get this prior? It might be\nthat they have a prior higher-order principle \\(P\\) that provides a\nprobabilistic ordering on different graph structures, and that the\ntaxonomy they use has a higher prior probability than other ways to\nstructure the animal world (say, a ring structure). But how do they\nget \\(P\\)? Do they learn it or is it simply there innately? To tackle\nthese questions, all sorts of objects\u2014structured representations\none finds in a grammar, graph-structures one might find in a taxonomic\nrepresentation of causal or kin relations, schemas applied to scene or\nevent analysis, etc.\u2014will need to be formalized and assigned\nprobabilities. So there is much to be done. There is no a priori\nanswer about how far up the Bayesian can go, and we do well to keep an\nopen mind about the nature of the unlearned priors. But we should also\nnot overlook findings like the chick\u2019s stubborn presumption of\nillumination from above, which suggest that nature can build\nin unlearned priors, and that they can be domain specific. It would\nbe, at the very least, extremely surprising if nothing like this\noperates in human psychology.\n\n\nBayesianism, then, focuses the Nativist-Empiricist question on the\npriors. First, we need to find out where the background\nknowledge brought to bear in any particular task comes from. Is\nsome part of it innate, or can its presence be accounted for in terms\nof higher-order Bayesian learning? At some point, the Bayesian\nwill come up against what is not learned by Bayesian methods (at the\nvery least, the Bayesian machinery\n itself[31]),\nand we will want to understand its specific\ncharacter. Will it be information implemented in our perceptual\nsystems or domain-general information that applies no matter what is\nbeing learned, supporting the Empiricist view, or will some of it be\ntailored to specific ranges and domains of knowledge, vindicating the\nNativist? We are still at the beginning of the road to the\nanswers to these questions.\n\n\nIt is important not to underestimate the challenge that Empiricists face.  The Bayesian formalism might make it seem that all that needs to be explained is why the hypotheses compatible with the data are ordered in the way they are.  So, for example, if it could be shown that the bias for a light from above explanation of the retinal image (in section 3.2) could, in principle, have been learned from experience, then it might appear that the Empiricist wins the round.  It is plausible that some of the priors relevant to scene recognition will be learnable in this way, so this may be right as far as it goes.  But it does not get to the heart of the challenge.\n\n\nOnce we shift our attention away from the Bayesian formalism and focus\non the fact that we are looking for an account of the\ncognitive/computational machinery that processes inputs and generates\ncomplex structural analyses of the world\u2014think here of the\nsubsystem that generates theory of mind representations of interacting\nagents in terms of goals, rationality, cooperation, desert, and so\non\u2014then it becomes clearer that the burden on the Empiricist is\nmuch greater.  She must not only explain where the representation\ntypes come from, she must also account for the cognitive\nprocessing over these representation types. So even if there were a\nsatisfactory Empiricist account of how the infant sorts inputs into\nthe categories agent, hinderer, and so on, we still need a separate\naccount of where the cognitive machinery that operates over these\ntypes comes from.  Without that, the infant will have a static\ntypology with no way to anticipate the dynamics of the situation.\nHere, then, the Empiricist seems to have two choices.  She must make\nthe case that the machinery involved is either (i) generic and\ndomain-independent, or (ii) domain-specific, but itself the product of\nhigher-order learning.\nThe point is that the Empiricist must account for the repertoire of\nrepresentation types that figure in the processing and for\nthe machinery that does the processing.  The ultimate outcome of this\ndebate will depend in part on how distinctive and complex the\ncomputational machinery turns out to be.  If the engine for theory of\nmind dynamics only needs to do tree search or production rule\napplication (for example), then the case for Empiricism is\nstrengthened, because these are very general computational capacities.\nOnly the content of the specific rules or the content at the nodes\nwill be domain-specific.  But the more idiosyncratic the computational\nmachinery in a specific subsystem\u2014for example, a simulator that\nanticipated motions and locations in a dynamic physical\nscene\u2014the greater the challenge for the Empiricist to explain\nhow such an internal computational device is acquired from experience\nalone.\n\nAs we noted, although Bayesianism has had a special appeal for Empiricists, one can use Bayesian methodologies and remain open to Nativist possibilities.  There is nothing to prevent a Bayesian from starting with an innate system of representations and computational machinery and then using Bayesian algorithms to figure out how learning from experience might work for such a system.  This approach is very much in line with the Core Nativist theorizing discussed in section 2.  (For a detailed defense of this methodology, see Lake et. al. forthcoming).\n\n\nIn summary, then, Bayesianism appeals to Empiricists for at least two\nimportant reasons. First, because it reinstates\nlearning from experience as a central process in cognitive\ndevelopment and change. This focus on learning contrasts sharply with\nthe first wave of Nativist cognitive research, which, inspired by\nChomsky\u2019s work in linguistics, tended to assign a diminished\nrole to learning from experience. Experience was thought to act as a\ntrigger/releaser of innate information, or, as in some linguistic\ntheorizing, as setting values to parameters that were left unspecified\nby our innate endowment. The lead role, again following Chomsky, was\nassigned to growth, understood simply as biological maturation. The\nsecond reason is that the current Bayesian mindset tends in\nsome ways towards Empiricism.  This is primarily because Bayesian\nlearning can, at least in principle, be extended hierarchically, in\nthe ways we\u2019ve discussed. But Bayesianism also has some appeal\nto Nativists, because it focuses attention on the role of background\nknowledge in learning, and this is a theme that Nativists have pressed\nagainst bottom-up Associationist forms of Empiricism from the\noutset. Nativists can welcome a renewed focus on learning, and join in\nthe development of Bayesian theories of cognitive development. So in\nthe end, Bayesianism\u2014as an approach to cognitive\ndevelopment\u2014is, like Connectionism, compatible with\nNativism. (For recent discussion of this last point, see Colombo 2017;\nfor a more pessimistic assessment of the potential contribution of\nBayesian approaches to psychology see Jones and Love 2011.)\nConcluding remarks: Nativism and Rationalism\n\n\nNativism, as we have seen, is a vigorous program in contemporary cognitive science.  But there is very little talk of Rationalism.   The term is sometimes repurposed as another name for Nativism, and in some cases it is explicitly disowned, with Nativism taken to be the only plank in the original Rationalist platform worth saving.  But following up on our previous discussion, there is a case to be made that this common attitude misses an important and distinctly Rationalist feature of current Core Nativist research.  Here we briefly sketch the key ideas behind this claim.\n\n\nThe Classical Nativist-Empiricist debate is an expression of a\ndisagreement about a bigger question: what is the (cognitive)\nmind and what is it for?  For the Empiricist (Hume 1975/1738\nbeing an especially clear example), the mind is first and foremost\na pattern detector, and it is for prediction.  For\nthe Humean, all we have to work with is one experience and then\nanother.  Cognitive processing is at bottom experience mining:\ndeploying our domain general cognitive machinery like statistical\nlearning routines, memory retrieval, attentional mechanisms,\nassociative connectivity, and so on, to detect patterns in the\nsequences of traces (Hume\u2019s ideas) that experience\nleaves behind in memory.\n\n\nFor the Rationalist, mind is for understanding.\nUnderstanding is of course connected to pattern detection and\nprediction, but it also involves making sense of the patterns\nat some deeper level.  The Classical Rationalist view is that Reason\n(with a capital \u2018R\u2019), in part embodied in our innate endowment,\nsomehow makes this sort of deeper understanding possible.  Descartes\u2019\nfamous wax example (Descartes 1996/1641) is aimed at making clear the\ndifference between detecting patterns in the flow of perceptual ideas\nthat are prompted by a piece of wax and having a real understanding of\nwhat a piece of wax is.  The Humean Empiricist rejects this search for\ndepth as illusory; pattern detection is all understanding is or can\nbe.\n\n\nOur point is that the Core Cognition approach retains this\ndistinctively Rationalist emphasis on understanding.  Core\nsystems like our intuitive physics and theory of mind help us\nconstruct models of the world based on innate abstract\nframeworks.  By deploying these theories we can go beyond the input\npatterns and come to understand not just how things look, but\nalso what they are, why they are as they are, why\nthey change in the ways they do, how things might be\nif relevant parameters were different, and so on.  When the baby sees\ntriangles pushing a square up a hill, she constructs a rich\nconceptualization of the scene that breaks things up into different\nkinds of elements, and assigns properties to the elements; properties\ninvolving agency, physical object, goals, private intentions,\ninformation states, rationality, number, shape, etc..  She can use\nthis conceptualization\u2014her intuitive theory\u2014to understand\nthe dynamics of what she sees and in that way make sense of\nthe situation.\n\n\nDespite this commonality, Core Nativists are not one with Classical\nRationalists.  Descartes took our innate Rational notion of the\nphysical to be at the heart of the true physics.  Newton showed that\nthis was wrong, and that we needed to go beyond our intuitive physics\nif we wanted to get a deeper understanding of the world.  Core\nKnowledge theorists reject the Classical assumption that our innate\nsense-making frameworks are necessarily true.  But true or\nnot, what is innate provides a framework that we use to make\nsense of the world.  To this extent, the Core Knowledge program\nrevitalizes this key Rationalist idea.  It remains an open question\nhow we are to understand this notion of (deep) understanding.  This\nsearch goes back at least as far as Plato.  But our point here has not\nbeen to defend the revival of this Rationalist theme; only to note the\ncommonality.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the studies that we surveyed\nin section 2 provide compelling evidence that\nwe have been underestimating how much infants and young children\nunderstand about the world. At the same time, it is clear that adult\ncompetence goes far beyond the child\u2019s in virtually every\ndomain. The Bayesian framework we discussed\nin section 3 has the potential to address both\nissues at once. It provides a systematic and quantifiable approach to\ndevelopment, and is at the same time open to incorporating innate\nelements. Whether it will succeed in unifying a learning-theoretic\napproach to cognitive development with the built-in representations\nfavored by Nativists remains to be seen.\n",
