    "main_text": "The Notion of the Aesthetic || Beauty and Sublimity\n4.5 Aesthetic Morals\n\nSubstantive aesthetic judgments attracted much attention in the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century. If the hierarchical proposal is right,\nthey cannot be studied in isolation, for the role of such judgments is\nto serve verdictive aesthetic judgments of beauty and ugliness. Beauty\nand ugliness are the primary aesthetic notions, which give sense to\nthe wider class that contemporary aestheticians include as\n\u201caesthetic\u201d. The broad notion of the aesthetic can be\nfixed by what it is to judge that something is beautiful or ugly, or\nthat it has aesthetic merit or demerit. By seeing beauty and ugliness\nas the preeminent aesthetic notions we can make sense of a unitary\ncategory of the aesthetic, which includes the dainty and the dumpy,\nelegance and sublimity, and which excludes physical, sensory and\nrepresentational properties of things, as well as their agreeableness.\nThe hierarchical proposal seems to allow us to make the\naesthetic/nonaesthetic distinction in a useful way and answer\nBeardsley and Sibley\u2019s critics. Perhaps in this way the notion\nof the aesthetic can be defended. However, some may think that\nLevinson is right about substantive aesthetic concepts and judgments,\nin which case the notion of the aesthetic has a question mark hanging\nover it.\n",
