    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Summary\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThe overall picture that emerges from Sylvan\u2019s work is of a\nbroad philosophy that draws on non-classical (relevant) logic, a\nneo-Meinongian metaphysics and a neo-Meinongian value theory as a\nmeans of accounting for \u201ccommon-sense\u201d ways of talking\n(e.g., about things that do not exist), ways of valuing (e.g., the\nseeming intrinsic value of things in the natural world) and\nsocio-political arrangements (e.g., a pluralist\nanarchism). Sylvan\u2019s work was radical, but rigorous; a rich\nmany-worlds semantics underpins formal analyses. His work was\ncontentious; many traditional philosophical \u201cproblems\u201d are\nclaimed to be artefacts of faulty orthodox theories. And his work was\nexpansive; philosophy\u2019s traditional role with the question\n\u201cHow are we to live?\u201d is taken seriously. Above all,\nSylvan\u2019s thought was unified and systematic: \u201cWhat is\nsought is a theory of values which blends both with object-theory and\nwith deeper environmental theory\u2026\u201d (1986, 1).\n\n\nSylvan\u2019s program was left unfinished when he died. Whatever one\nthinks of his bold statements (\u201ca wild mixture of wonderfully\nincisive ideas and absolutely false claims,\u201d as Meyer put it in\n1996), Sylvan pushes philosophers to recognize that many propositions\ntaken as facts are not unrestrictedly true, but rather are\nrelative to what assumptions one is making about logic,\nontology, and value. Changing those assumptions changes the\npossibilities. And Sylvan\u2019s work urges us to be ready for more\npossibilities\u2014even what is, as he put it, \u201cbeyond the\npossible\u201d (this is the title of an unpublished manuscript cited\nin Routley 1980).\n",
