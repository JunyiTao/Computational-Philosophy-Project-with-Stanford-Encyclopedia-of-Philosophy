    "main_text": "The Passions and the Will\n2. The Passions and the Will\n \n\nAccording to Hume\u2019s theory of the mind, the passions (what we today\nwould call emotions, feelings, and desires) are impressions rather\nthan ideas (original, vivid and lively perceptions that are not copied\nfrom other perceptions). The direct passions, which include desire,\naversion, hope, fear, grief, and joy, are those that \u201carise\nimmediately from good or evil, from pain or pleasure\u201d that we\nexperience or think about in prospect (T 2.1.1.4, T 2.3.9.2); however\nhe also groups with them some instincts of unknown origin, such as the\nbodily appetites and the desires that good come to those we love and\nharm to those we hate, which do not proceed from pain and pleasure but\nproduce them (T 2.3.9.7). The indirect passions, primarily pride,\nhumility (shame), love and hatred, are generated in a more complex\nway, but still one involving either the thought or experience of pain\nor pleasure.  Intentional actions are caused by the direct passions\n(including the instincts).  Of the indirect passions Hume says that\npride, humility, love and hatred do not directly cause action; it is\nnot clear whether he thinks this true of all the indirect\npassions.\n\n\nHume is traditionally regarded as a compatibilist about freedom and\ndeterminism, because in his discussion in the Enquiry concerning\nHuman Understanding he argues that if we understand the\ndoctrines of liberty and necessity properly, all mankind consistently\nbelieve both that human actions are the products of causal necessity\nand that they are free. In the Treatise, however, he\nexplicitly repudiates the doctrine of liberty as \u201cabsurd... in\none sense, and unintelligible in any other\u201d (T 2.3.2.1). The two\ntreatments, however, surprisingly enough, are entirely consistent. Hume construes causal necessity\nto mean the same as causal connection (or rather, intelligible\ncausal connection), as he himself analyzes this notion in his own\ntheory of causation: either the \u201cconstant union and conjunction\nof like objects,\u201d or that together with \u201cthe inference of\nthe mind from the one to the other\u201d (ibid.). In both works he\nargues that just as we discover necessity (in this sense) to hold\nbetween the movements of material bodies, we discover just as much\nnecessity to hold between human motives, character traits, and\ncircumstances of action, on the one hand, and human behavior on the\nother. He says in the Treatise that the liberty of\nindifference is the negation of necessity in this sense; this is the\nnotion of liberty that he there labels absurd, and identifies with\nchance or randomness (which can be no real power in nature) both in the\nTreatise and the first (epistemological) Enquiry. Human\nactions are not free in this sense. However, Hume allows in the\nTreatise that they are sometimes free in the sense of\n\u2018liberty\u2019 which is opposed to violence or constraint. This is the\nsense on which Hume focuses in EcHU: \u201ca power of acting or\nnot acting, according to the determinations of the will;\u201d\nwhich everyone has \u201cwho is not a prisoner and in chains\u201d\n(EcHU 8.1.23, Hume\u2019s emphasis). It is this that is entirely compatible\nwith necessity in Hume\u2019s sense. So the positions in the two works are\nthe same, although the polemical emphasis is so different \u2014\niconoclastic toward the libertarian view in the Treatise, and\nconciliatory toward \u201call mankind\u201d in the first\nEnquiry.\n\n\nHume argues, as well, that the causal necessity of human actions is\nnot only compatible with moral responsibility but requisite to it. To\nhold an agent morally responsible for a bad action, it is not enough\nthat the action be morally reprehensible; we must impute the badness of\nthe fleeting act to the enduring agent. Not all harmful or forbidden\nactions incur blame for the agent; those done by accident, for example,\ndo not. It is only when, and because, the action\u2019s cause is some\nenduring passion or trait of character in the agent that she\nis to blame for it.\n",
