    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nJohn Wyclif was born near Richmond (Yorkshire) before 1330 and\nordained in 1351. He spent the greater part of his life in the schools\nat Oxford: he was fellow of Merton in 1356, master of arts at Balliol\nin 1360, and doctor of divinity in 1372. He definitely left Oxford in\n1381 for Lutterworth (Leicestershire), where he died on 31 December,\n1384. It was not until 1374 (when he went on a diplomatic mission to\nBruges) that Wyclif entered the royal service, but his connection with\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, probably dates back to 1371. His\nideas on lordship and church wealth, expressed in De civili\ndominio (On Civil Dominion), caused his first official\ncondemnation in 1377 by the Pope (Gregory XI), who censured nineteen\narticles. As has been pointed out (Leff 1967), in 1377\u201378 Wyclif\nmade a swift progression from unqualified fundamentalism to a\nheretical view of the Church and its Sacraments. He clearly claimed\nthe supremacy of the king over the priesthood (see for instance his\nDe ecclesia [On the Church], between early 1378 and\nearly 1379), and the simultaneous presence in the Eucharist of the\nsubstance of the bread and the body of Christ (De eucharistia\n[On the Eucharist], and De apostasia [On\nApostasy], both ca. 1380). His theses would influence Jan Hus and\nJerome of Prague in the 15th century. So long as he limited\nhis attack to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on\nthe support of a (more or less extended) part of the clergy and\naristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of\ntransubstantiation, his (unorthodox) theses could not be defended any\nmore. Thus in 1382 Archbishop Courtenay had twenty-four propositions\nthat were attributed to Wyclif condemned by a council of theologians,\nand could force Wyclif\u2019s followers at Oxford University to\nretract their views or flee. The Council of Constance (1414\u201318)\ncondemned Wyclif\u2019s writings and ordered his books burned and his\nbody removed from consecrated ground. This last order, confirmed by\nPope Martin V, was carried out in 1428.\n\nThe most complete biographical study of Wyclif is still the monograph\nof Workman 1926, but the best analysis of his intellectual development\nand of the philosophical and theological context of his ideas is\nRobson 1961.\n",
