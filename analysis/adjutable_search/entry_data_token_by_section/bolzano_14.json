    "main_text": "Epistemology and Philosophy of Science || Subjective Intuitions and Subjective Concepts\n4.2 Subjective Intuitions and Subjective Concepts\n\nAn intuition is for Bolzano an idea that is simple and singular (cf.\nsection 3.5). The question arises immediately whether such an\nintuition exists after all and \u2014 if so \u2014 what it can\ncontribute to epistemology. Both questions are answered by Bolzano at\nonce: In order to show that there are intuitions, he hints at\nsubjective ideas (ideas in our minds) that grasp\n\u201cobjective\u201d intuitions as defined before; and since these\nsubjective intuitions exist in our actual world, the corresponding\n\u201cobjective\u201d intuitions must exist (in the sense of\n\u2018es gibt\u2019) in the logical realm of World 3. What\nare the examples of subjective intuitions, however, that Bolzano can\nput forward in support of his claim? It is subjective ideas such as\nthe subjective idea of the change in our mind that is the immediate\nreaction on an outer object (such as a rose) that stimulates our\nsenses. In everyday language we usually express such an idea only by\nthe word \u2018that\u2019 (\u2018dieses\u2019 or \u2014\nin Bolzano\u2019s old-fashioned orthography \u2014\n\u2018die\u00df\u2019). Bolzano\u2019s rather long-winded\nexplication (in WL I, 326 f.) reveals subjective ideas of a particular\nsensation or sense-datum as his favorite examples of subjective\nintuitions (cf. also WL III, 21 f.). The object and the cause of a\nsubjective intuition of this kind is itself a mental phenomenon such\nas a subjective idea or a judgment (WL III, 85). If a subjective\nintuition is directly caused by an \u201couter\u201d object, Bolzano\ncalls it an \u2018outer intuition\u2019. Also in the case of an\nouter intuition, its proper object is not the\n\u201couter\u201d cause of it but an \u201cinner\u201d mental\nevent; human beings are capable only of having subjective intuitions\nwhose proper object is a change in their mind (WL III, 89). In other\npassages Bolzano seems to be less cautious and claims also of an idea\nsuch as [Vesuvius] (WL II, 38) or [Socrates] (WL I, 346, in explicit\ncontradiction to WL III, 89) to be a pure intuition whose appearance\nin the mind of a thinking being is a subjective intuition. This would\nobviously result in taking each rigid designator (in today\u2019s\nterminology) to express an intuition.\n\nIn the same way in which a subjective intuition is defined as a\nsubjective idea that \u201cgrasps\u201d (in the sense of\n\\(\\mathbf{G})\\) an \u201cobjective\u201d intuition, we can also\ndefine subjective concepts and \u201cmixed\u201d subjective ideas\n(WL III, 21\u201323).\n",
