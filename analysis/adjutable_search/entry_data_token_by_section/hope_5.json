    "main_text": "The Philosophical History of Hope || Immanuel Kant\n2.4 Immanuel Kant\n\nWhile hope is primarily discussed as a feature of the psychology of\nindividual humans in the 17th and 18th century\nand, as a non-cognitive attitude, taken to be neither essentially\nrational nor irrational, it is given much greater significance by\nImmanuel Kant who adopts a much more substantial (and complex) view of\nthe connection between hope and reason.\n\nKant\u2019s definition of hope as an \u201cunexpected offering of\nthe prospect of immeasurable good fortune\u201d (AE 7:255) in the\nAnthropology seems to remain within the traditional discourse\nabout hope. However, Kant eventually accords hope a central place in\nhis philosophical system by focusing on hope as an attitude that\nallows human reason to relate to those questions which cannot be\nanswered by experience. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant\nstates the question \u201cFor what may I hope?\u201d as one of the\nfundamental questions of philosophy, after \u201cWhat can I\nknow?\u201d and \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d (A805/B833). This\nquestion, as far as its answer depends on claims regarding the\nconsequences of moral righteousness and the existence of God, is\n\u201csimultaneously practical and theoretical\u201d (A805/B833) and\nit is answered by religion (AE 9:25). Kant\u2019s account of hope\nconsequently connects his moral philosophy with his views on religion.\nHe emphasizes the rational potential of such hope, but he also makes\nclear that rational hope is intimately connected to religious faith,\ni.e., the belief in God.\n\nKant considers three primary objects of hope in his writings: (1)\nOne\u2019s own happiness (as part of the highest good), (2)\none\u2019s own moral progress (in the Religion) and (3) the\nmoral improvement of the human race as a whole (in his\nhistorical-political writings).\n\n(1) In the Canon of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant states clearly: \u201call hope concerns happiness\u201d\n(A805/B833). However, it is not the hope for one\u2019s own happiness\nsimpliciter that is at stake, but the hope for happiness that\none deserves because of one\u2019s moral conduct (A809/B837). Kant\nargues that there is a necessary connection between the moral\nlaw and the hope for happiness. However, this connection exists only\n\u201cin the idea of pure reason\u201d, not in nature (A809/B837). A\nproportionality between happiness and morality can only be thought of\nas necessary in an intelligible, moral world, where we abstract from\nall hindrances to moral conduct. In the empirical world of experience,\nthere is no guarantee for a necessary connection between moral conduct\nand happiness. Thus, Kant concludes, we may reasonably hope for\nhappiness in proportion to morality only if we introduce the\nadditional non-empirical assumption of \u201ca highest reason, which\ncommands in accordance with moral laws, as [\u2026] the cause of\nnature\u201d (A810/B838). This way, Kant connects morality and\nhappiness in the object of hope and secures its possibility in a\nhighest reason, i.e., in God. Kant calls the connection between\n\u201chappiness in exact proportion with the morality of rational\nbeings, through which they are worthy of it\u201d the highest\ngood (A814/B842). A peculiarity of Kant\u2019s treatment of hope\nin the Canon is that hope for the highest good is apparently\nconsidered necessary for moral motivation (A813/B841)\u2014a thesis\nhe rejects in his later writings.\n\nKant\u2019s account of hope for happiness presents hope as very\nclosely connected to Kant\u2019s concept of faith. This becomes\nobvious in the Critique of Practical Reason. Kant argues that\nin order to believe in the possibility of the highest good\u2014and\nwe have to believe in this possibility, as it is prescribed by the\ncategorical imperative\u2014we have to believe in or\npostulate the existence of God and the immortality of the\nsoul. Kant himself uses both the concept of belief or faith\nand the concept of hope in explaining the content of the\npostulate of immortality: we must presuppose immortality in\norder to conceive of the highest good as \u201cpractically\npossible\u201d and we may therefore \u201chope for a further\nuninterrupted continuance of this [moral] progress, however long his\nexistence may last, even beyond this life\u201d (AE 5:123). Thus,\nKant can be understood as arguing in favor of a traditional religious\nform of hope\u2014hope for a life after death or immortality of the\nsoul. However, he points out that immortality is not a \u2018mere\u2019\nhope (i.e., a hope for an outcome where we lack evidence for the claim\nthat it is really possible), but that reason makes it necessary (as a\nconsequence of the categorical imperative) to assume that immortality\nis possible.\n\nWhereas some Kant interpreters do not clearly distinguish between hope\nand faith (Rossi 1982, Flikschuh 2010), Andrew Chignell emphasizes\nthat hope is an attitude that is distinct from faith or belief and\nthat Kant follows an \u201cassert-the-stronger\u201d policy: He\nasserts the strongest justified attitude towards p (justified\nbelief), even if one holds also weaker attitudes towards p\n(hope) (Chignell 2013: 198). O\u2019Neill interprets Kant as holding\nthat hope provides a reason for religious belief: Belief in\nGod and immortality is not \u201cmerely possible\u201d, but a matter\nof \u201ctaking a hopeful view of human destiny\u201d (O\u2019Neill\n1996: 281). According to O\u2019Neill, the reason for faith is the\nhope that moral action is successful, i.e., that our moral intention\ncan make a difference to the natural order.\n\n(2) In the Religion, Kant envisages one\u2019s own moral\nimprovement as an object of hope, which requires that one change\none\u2019s fundamental maxim from a bad one to a good one. The\nproblem is that on the one hand, we have a duty to improve morally and\nhence must be capable of doing so (AE 6:45), but on the other hand, it\nis unclear how this can be possible if one\u2019s fundamental maxim\nis corrupt. Since we cannot know how this is possible, moral\nimprovement remains an object of hope. Kant suggests two alternative\nhopes: the hope to, through one\u2019s \u201cown efforts\u201d,\nbecome a better person (AE 6:46) and the hope that what exceeds\none\u2019s power will be taken care of by God (AE 6:52).\n\n(3) In his political and historical writings, Kant considers another\nobject of reasonable hope: the hope for historical progress towards a\nmorally better, peaceful future. We find a similar relationship\nbetween rational belief and hope as with regard to God and\nimmortality: Kant sees the moral improvement of the human race as a\nhope that is based on a transcendental assumption (in the mode of\nfaith) in a teleological order of nature. Kant assigns \u201chope for\nbetter times\u201d an important function for moral motivation by\nclaiming that without it, the desire to benefit the common good would\n\u201cnever have warmed the human heart\u201d (AE 8:309). Kant\nrecommends a view of human history with a \u201cconfirmation\nbias\u201d (Kleingeld 2012: 175), i.e., with a view to the\nrealization of moral demands.\n\nAside from these systematic issues regarding hope in Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy, it is worth summarizing some general features that Kant\ntouches upon concerning hope. Regarding a descriptive account\nof what it means that a person hopes that p, one can extract\ntwo necessary conditions from Kant\u2019s remarks that are in line\nwith the standard account of hope: The object of hope must be\nuncertain, and the person must wish for it. Both conditions can be\nfound in the following passage from Perpetual Peace:\n\n\n[R]eason is not enlightened enough to survey the entire series of\npredetermining causes that foretell with certainty the happy or\nunhappy consequences of humankind\u2019s activities in accordance\nwith the mechanism of nature (although it does let us hope that these\nwill be in accord with our wishes). (AE 8:370)\n\n\nIn regard to the normative conditions under which hope is\nrational, Kant is sensitive to a theoretical and practical dimension:\nHe focuses on hopes that are (necessarily) connected with a moral duty\nand thus involve a practical necessity. From a theoretical\npoint of view, Kant\u2019s main concern is to show that these hopes\nare not impossible. While he holds that empirical evidence permits\nhoping as long as there is no proof to the contrary (AE 8:309f.), this\nminimal criterion is connected to the idea that hope is based on\ntranscendental assumptions (i.e., the existence of God, immortality,\nand a teleology of nature) (Bl\u00f6ser 2020b).\n\nKant\u2019s account of hope has recently attracted considerable\ninterest, both regarding matters of Kant scholarship and the\napplication and development of a Kantian notion of hope in various\ncontexts. As to Kant scholarship, D\u00fcring and D\u00fcwell (2017) follow\nBeyleveld and Ziche (2015) in emphasizing the relevance of the\nCritique of Judgment for an understanding of Kantian hope\n\u2013\u2013 they view hope as aesthetically structured.\nZuckert (2018) argues that Kantian hope is a feeling.\nDanziger (2020) makes the case that hope plays a role even in\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n\nAs to the application and development of Kant\u2019s account of hope,\nChignell (2018) reconstructs Kant\u2019s moral argument for faith in\nthe existence of God (where hope plays a crucial role) and explores\nits relevance for political contexts (the food system), where the\nchances that an individual will make a difference are very low.\nSimilarly, Huber (2019) argues that Kantian hope can be seen as\nplaying an important role in preventing demoralization and sustaining\nthe commitment to political action when the prospects of success are\ndim. Dineen (2020) delineates a Kantian conception of hope that might\ninform practical education, because it warrants us in thinking that we\nare able to set and achieve ends, even in light of imperfection and\nvulnerability. Speight (2021) shows how Walter Benjamin took up and\ntransformed Kant\u2019s account of hope by shifting from a personal\nto a collective perspective on hope and to a concern with the\npast.\n",
