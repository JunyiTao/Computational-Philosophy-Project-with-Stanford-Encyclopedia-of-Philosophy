    "main_text": "Metaphysics || \u012a\u015bvara (God)\n2.4 \u012a\u015bvara (God)\n\nThough \u015aa\u1e45kara dismisses empirical reality from the\nmetaphysical standpoint of nonduality, the universe still possesses\nvalue in its identification with \u012b\u015bvara (usually\ntranslated as \u201cGod\u201d or \u201cLord\u201d for lack of a\nmore suitable English term). \u015aa\u1e45kara is ambiguous at times\nin differentiating \u012b\u015bvara from brahman,\nand uses several terms synonymously for both such as the\n\u201chighest lord\u201d (parame\u015bvara); but he\ngenerally distinguishes \u012bsvara as the lower\n(apara) brahman qualified with attributes (i.e., the\nuniverse), from the higher (apara) brahman that is\nabsolute nonduality (BrS\u016bBh 4.3.14). Following his readings of\nthe Upani\u1e63ads, \u015aa\u1e45kara identifies\n\u012b\u015bvara as both the material and intelligent causes\nof the universe (BrS\u016bBh 1.1.2). \u012a\u015bvara\nemanates the universe through a cosmic causal power\n(m\u0101y\u0101\u1e63akti), and is the very process of\nbecoming itself, a beginningless cycle of universe manifestation,\nsustenance, and dissolution. This process is an auto-cosmogony, making\n\u012b\u015bvara the material of the universe. As nothing but\n\u012b\u015bvara, the whole universe is sentient and\nself-aware. (See Ram-Prasad 2013; Comans 2000; Hacker 1995; and\nWarrier 1977 for further discussions of\n\u012b\u015bvara).\n\nFollowing his reading of the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\nUpani\u1e63ad, \u015aa\u1e45kara likens the universe\u2019s\nunmanifest state to \u012b\u015bvara in a cosmic state of\ndeep dreamless sleep. Manifestation occurs when\n\u012b\u015bvara, as the intelligent cause, visualizes the\nuniverse through memory of past universes. This projective ontological\ncapacity of \u012b\u015bvara is analogous to an\nindividual\u2019s process of dreaming. Dreaming utilizes memory to\nproject a dream world that is not separate from one\u2019s mind\n(B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.10). The universe is similarly an effortless\nmanifestation of \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s knowledge, and\npossesses no existence apart from \u012b\u015bvara. The\nuniverse\u2019s ongoing manifestation is concurrent with\n\u012b\u015bvara\u2019s perception of it like the dreamscape\nis concurrent with the dreamer\u2019s perception. The\nuniverse\u2019s very existence depends on \u012b\u015bvara\nknowing it, for \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s knowing is its very\nprojection into objective existence.\n\nAs the material cause, \u012b\u015bvara takes form as the\nuniverse through a processual cosmogony of subtle elements that\nundergo a process of grossification, first into elements and then into\nobjects. On the level of subtle elements, \u012b\u015bvara\nfunctions as a cosmic mind named Hira\u1e47yagarbha, whose\nunrestricted intelligence pervades the universe. This cosmic mind is\nenlivened by its fundamental ground of consciousness-existence\n(brahman). On the level of coarse element composition, the\nperceptible universe is akin to \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s\nphysical body or brain. In this form \u012b\u015bvara is\nnamed Vir\u0101t. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s view of the universe at\nthe empirical level, with its universal mind and fundamental nature as\nconsciousness, parallels some contemporary iterations of panentheism\nand panpsychism, particularly top-down cosmopsychism; however, his\nultimate view of nondual brahman collapses any questions\nabout the individual derivation or instantiation of nondual\nconsciousness. (See Gasparri 2019; Vaidya 2020; and Albahari 2019 for\ncomparisons of Advaita Ved\u0101nta and cosmopsychism).\n\nIndividuals are microcosms homologous to the \u012b\u015bvara\nmacrocosm; however, they are part and parcel of the universe. They are\nontologically dependent on \u012b\u015bvara and lack any\nobjective ontological power of projection beyond subjective\nprojections like dreaming and imagination. While the individual has a\npart to whole relationship with \u012b\u015bvara from the\nmind-body standpoint, ultimately there is only numerical identity\nbetween the individual and \u012b\u015bvara from the\nstandpoint of existence identified as pure consciousness.\n\u012a\u015bvara is the \u201cknower of the field\u201d\n(k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a)\u2014the core of subjectivity\npresent in all living beings and identified with brahman as\npure consciousness (BhGBh 13.2).\n",
