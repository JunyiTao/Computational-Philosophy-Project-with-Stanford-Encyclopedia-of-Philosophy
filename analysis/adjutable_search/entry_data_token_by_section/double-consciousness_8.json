Double-Consciousness in Souls of Black Folk: Problems\n\nThe preceding survey yields several points of contention: issues\nconcerning the source(s) of Du Bois\u2019s conception and\nterminology, of its putative Rousseauian, Hegelian and/or American\nphilosophical connections; the scope of the conception, that is, how\nwidely and to whom Du Bois thought it applied; the relation between\ndouble-consciousness and the psychic duality he associated it with;\nthe nature of \u201csecond sight\u201d, and its relation to\ndouble-consciousness; double-consciousness\u2019s relation to alleged\n\u201cpathology,\u201d and to critical awareness or critique; the\nconception\u2019s usefulness for an understanding of the situation of\nblack folk, both at the turn of the twentieth century when Du Bois put\nit forward, and today. Here we briefly recapitulate several of\nthese.\n\nThe first question, one Gooding-Williams identifies as a paradox,\nconcerns Du Bois\u2019s own invulnerability to double-consciousness.\nIf double-consciousness is indeed endemic to \u201cNegroes\u201d\n\u2013 if it was, in a sense, a structural problem for any\nNegro consciousness under conditions of Jim Crow \u2013 then how\ncould Du Bois himself write as if transcending it, as having\n\u201ctrue self-conscious manhood\u201d? Although Du Bois never\nexplicitly makes the claim that he himself is free from\ndouble-consciousness, his text hints at no such internal\nsoul-struggle. And yet, his conception of double-consciousness is\nintroduced as part of an account of his own personal experience and as\nbased on that experience.\n\nGooding-Williams tries to overcome this paradox by distinguishing the\nnarrative authority of Souls from the historical author of\nthe text. It is the narrator of Souls, and not Du Bois\nhimself, who has escaped double-consciousness. This may save\nSouls as a literary text, but it doesn\u2019t rescue the\nidea of black political leadership, implying that no actual black\npolitical leader is immune from double-consciousness. Another possible\nresolution to the paradox involves the notion of a second sight awake\nto the contradictions of the dominant white cultural milieu, allowing\na rejection of its biased assumption about black folk (what Henry\ncalls \u201cpotentiated second sight\u201d).\n\nDu Bois often insisted that his accounting of \u201cthe Negro\nproblem\u201d \u2013 or, alternatively, of \u201cthe race\nconcept\u201d \u2013 involves leading his readers \u201cwithin the\nVeil\u201d \u2013 making it possible for his (presumably mostly\nwhite) readers to gain some sense of the experience of \u201cbeing\nblack\u201d. This involves, as he puts it in Dusk of Dawn\n(1940), \u201celucidating the inner meaning and significance of that\nrace problem by explaining it in terms of the one human life that I\nknow best\u201d (1968 [1940]: viii). But that one life was one lived\nat the top of \u201cthe upper layers of educated and ambitious\nNegroes\u201d (1968 [1940]: 185), and so, it was exceptional. This\nreturns us to the question of the scope of double-consciousness.\n\nWhile Du Bois presents double-consciousness in the 1903 texts as a\nproblem for black folks generally given conditions of segregation and\nhistorically persisting inequality, a closer inspection of the text\nsuggests that the phenomenon might be specific to black leadership or\nthose who are most fully caught between the white world and\nthe world of color, who have deliberately undertaken the \u201cthe\nmoral uplift\u201d of the \u201cbackward\u201d black masses, and\nwho stand as \u201crepresentatives\u201d of these\n\u201cworlds\u201d to each other. The \u201cStrivings\u201d\npassage cites as illustrative examples only educated,\n\u201cbetter\u201d Negroes: the \u2018black artisan\u2019, the\nNegro minister or doctor, the \u201cwould be black\nsavant\u201d and the black artist. Du Bois also devotes\nseveral further chapters in Souls to detailed\ncharacterizations of the inner struggles of actual or fictional\nleaders \u2013 Washington, Crummell, and the fictional John Jones.\nYet much of the force of the claim for double-consciousness in the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text is its universal attribution to\n\u201cthe Negro in this American world\u201d.\n\nSome recent commentators have rejected the claim that\ndouble-consciousness, in the sense of a self-perception of\ninferiority, has been a universal feature of black life. Molefi Kete\nAsante, discussing his own experience growing up in Valdosta, Georgia,\nin the 1950s, writes that\n\n[t]he tightly knit community of Africans who lived on the dirt roads\nof Valdosta never saw themselves as intellectually or physically\ninferior to whites. There existed no reference points outside of\nourselves despite the economic and psychological poverty of our\nsituation. (1993: 133)\n\n\nSeveral pages later Asante states flat-out, \u201cI was never\naffected by the Du Boisian double-consciousness\u201d (1993: 136). He\ndoes go on to acknowledge his distinct circumstances\n\nIt might have been another matter if I had gone to school and to\nchurch with whites when I was younger. I might have suffered\nconfusion, double-consciousness, but I did not. (1993: 137)\n\n\nA third issue for Du Bois\u2019s conception of double-consciousness\nconcerns its putative relation to the \u201ctwo-ness\u201d of the\nNegro psyche, which he never clarifies. Du Bois was concerned early on\nto establish a distinct contribution of \u201cthe Negro\u201d to\nworld culture and civilization, since lynch law and the backlash\nagainst Reconstruction raised the specter of genocidal extermination\nof black folk in America. A distinctly \u201cNegro\u201d cultural\ncontribution seems to require distinctive Negro \u201cideals\u201d.\nAllen and others have argued that Du Bois presents vague, seemingly\nempty, or contradictory accounts of just what the conflicting American\nand Negro \u201cideals\u201d are. The question, then, is whether Du\nBois\u2019s reference to such ideals can be sustained as an\nindependent source of the \u201ctwo-ness\u201d which Du Bois\nconnects to double-consciousness. If there are indeed such (non-empty)\nideals, and they are an independent source of conflictual two-ness,\nthen double-consciousness might turn out to be a more complex\nphenomenon yet.\n\nThe Du Boisian conception has been criticized as well for\noversimplifying the complex multidimensionality of contemporary\nselves, harboring a nostalgia for a unitary, integral self that never\nexisted, an unachievable ideal. Thus Darlene Clark Hine asserts:\n\nhad Du Bois specifically included the experiences and lives of black\nwomen in his lament, \u2026 instead of writing, \u201cOne ever\nfeels his twoness\u201d, he would have mused about how one ever feels\nher \u201cfiveness\u201d: Negro, American, woman, poor, black woman.\n(Hines 1993: 338)\n\n\nCritiques of Du Bois\u2019s conception along these lines have become\nwidespread, but, it might be argued, they are in one sense beside the\npoint. That the 1903 text is masculinist seems undeniable. But\nit\u2019s also true that Du Bois\u2019s\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d was not proposed as a comprehensive\naccount of the reality of human being, was not addressed to the\nvariety of sources of human social identity per se. His\nconception was an attempt to capture the lived experience of black\nfolk as black folk in the United States under conditions of\nJim Crow. So it would be wholly consistent with his conception if,\nadded to the doubling of consciousness due to racial oppression, other\nforms of psychic doubling or fragmentation, responses to other forms\nof inequality, might exist.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. addresses the normative thrust of Du\nBois\u2019s conception in noting that\n\ncultural multiplicity is no longer seen as the problem, but as a\nsolution \u2013 a solution to the confines of identity itself. Double\nconsciousness, once a disorder, is now the cure. (2006: xv)\n\n\nThis remark depends on confusing a general duality or psychic\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d with Du Bois\u2019s double-consciousness\nconception itself. Surely even if \u201ccultural multiplicity\u201d\nhas come to be valuable in itself, as Gates has it, the \u201camused\ncontempt and pity\u201d directed against oneself, crucial to Du\nBois\u2019s formulation, cannot be part of any\n\u201ccure\u201d.\n\nFinally, a question might be raised about the relation of Du\nBois\u2019s double-consciousness conception and the sorts of\nself-doubts, troubled feelings, and \u201cidentity issues\u201d that\nhave been linked to biracial or mixed-race appearance or identity in\nour persisting, harshly racialized American social world. White\nsupremacy has presented particular difficulties for persons of\nambivalent racial descent, visibly marked as brought into being by\n\u201crace mixing\u201d. Mixed-race persons have encountered\nhostility from \u201cboth sides\u201d, and are often deemed weak or\ninferior just because they are mixed, as Naomi Zack documents\nin her Race and Mixed-Race (1993: chapters 11, 12). Indeed,\nDu Bois was personally familiar with this issue. His \u201cmost\ninteresting\u201d professor during his university days in Berlin was\nHeinrich von Trietschke;\n\n[o]ne day he startled me by suddenly declaring during a lecture on\nAmerica: \u201cDie Mulattin sind niedrig! Sie fuhlen sich\nniedrig!\u201d [Mulattoes are inferior; they feel themselves\ninferior.] I felt as if he were pointing me out; but I presume he was\nquite unaware of my presence. However my presence or absence would\nhave made no difference to him. \u2026 My fellow students gave no\nevidence of connecting what he said with me. (Du Bois 1968: 165)\n\n\nYet when Du Bois formulated \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in\nSouls, mixed-race and skin-color discriminations within the\nblack racial designation were not topics he addressed in print. The\nduality posited in the texts of 1903 is one between\n\u201cNegro\u201d \u2013 an identity then typically keyed to a\nmetaphysically conceived racial designation \u2013 and\n\u201cAmerican\u201d \u2013 one based on a putative citizenship\nstatus. Racial designation at that time was determined primarily\nthrough hypodescent, and the citizenship status of black folk had\nrecently been impugned by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n",
