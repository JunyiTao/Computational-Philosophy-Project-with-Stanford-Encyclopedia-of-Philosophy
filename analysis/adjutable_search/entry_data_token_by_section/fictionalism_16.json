    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || Philosophy of language concerns\n4.5 Philosophy of language concerns\n\nThe hermeneutic fictionalist about a discourse D typically\nclaims that there is a radical mismatch between on the one hand what\nwe may call the assertoric contents of utterances of\nsentences of D (what is expressed in ordinary utterances of\nthese sentences) and on the other hand the semantic contents\nof these sentences (what these sentences semantically express, in the\ncontexts of utterance). But when it is stated thus baldly what the\nstrategy is, two related worries should immediately arise, having to\ndo with foundational issues in the philosophy of language.\n\nFirst, even setting radical use theories to the side, many\nphilosophers have supposed that the semantic content of a sentence is\nsomehow determined, at least largely, by what the sentence is\ncustomarily used to express. This would seem to entail that there must\nbe a close connection between the semantic content of a sentence and\nhow the sentence is customarily used. But then it is odd if there is\nthe kind of systematic mismatch between assertoric content and\nsemantic content that the fictionalist claims that there is; or that\nis the worry.\n\nSecond, putting matters in this more technical way highlights another\npotential difficulty. There are deep and unresolved issues in\nphilosophy of language concerning the nature of assertoric and\nsemantic content, respectively, and concerning the relation between\nthem. While these issues remain unresolved, it may be premature to put\nforward strong claims about the relation of the assertoric and\nsemantic contents. Generally, and relating back to the points made in\nthe previous subsection, it can be suspected that fictionalists tend\nto have a too simple view of semantic content.\n\nOne fictionalist reply to these concerns is to say that it is only for\nargument\u2019s sake that she adopts a conservative view of the\nsemantic contents of the sentences of the discourse in question. She\ncan say that her basic point is that the discourses are not in fact\nontologically committing. If the sentences are not ontologically\ncommitting even when they are used literally, that is fine. What she\nis arguing is that even if the sentences are ontologically\ncommitting as used literally, there is reason to think that the\ndiscourse is not ontologically committing. Perhaps, in light of the\npoint about how use determines meaning, the fact that our use of the\nsentences is not ontologically committing should cast doubt on any\nsemantics of these sentences given which they are. But that does not\naffect the more general philosophical point the fictionalist is\ntypically concerned to make: that the discourse is not ontologically\ncommitting.\n",
