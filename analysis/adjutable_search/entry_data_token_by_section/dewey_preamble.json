    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Dewey (1859\u20131952) was one of American pragmatism\u2019s\nearly founders, along with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James,\nand arguably the most prominent American intellectual for the first\nhalf of the twentieth century. Dewey\u2019s educational theories and\nexperiments had a global reach, his psychological theories had a\nsizable influence in that growing science, and his writings about\ndemocratic theory and practice deeply influenced debates in academic\nand practical quarters for decades. In addition, Dewey developed\nextensive and often systematic views in ethics, epistemology, logic,\nmetaphysics, aesthetics, and philosophy of religion. Because Dewey\ntypically took a genealogical approach that couched his own view\nwithin the larger history of philosophy, one may also find a fully\ndeveloped metaphilosophy in his work.\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatism\u2014or, \u201ccultural naturalism\u201d,\nwhich he favored over \u201cpragmatism\u201d and\n\u201cinstrumentalism\u201d\u2014may be understood as a critique\nand reconstruction of philosophy within the larger ambit of a\nDarwinian worldview (Lamont 1961; MW4: 3). Following James\u2019\nlead, Dewey argued that philosophy had become an overly technical and\nintellectualistic discipline, divorced from assessing the social\nconditions and values dominating everyday life (FAE, LW5:\n157\u201358). He sought to reconnect philosophy with the mission of\neducation-for-living (philosophy as \u201cthe general theory of\neducation\u201d), a form of social criticism at the most general\nlevel, or \u201ccriticism of criticisms\u201d (EN, LW1:\n298; see also DE, MW9: 338).\n\nSet within the larger picture of Darwinian evolutionary theory,\nphilosophy should be seen as an activity undertaken by interdependent\norganisms-in-environments. This standpoint, of active adaptation, led\nDewey to criticize the tendency of traditional philosophies to\nabstract and reify concepts derived from living contexts. As did other\nclassical pragmatists, Dewey focused criticism upon traditional\ndualisms of metaphysics and epistemology (e.g., mind/body,\nnature/culture, self/society, and reason/emotion) and then\nreconstructed their elements as parts of larger continuities. For\nexample, human thinking is not a phenomenon which is radically outside\nof (or external to) the world it seeks to know; knowing is\nnot a purely rational attempt to escape illusion in order to\ndiscover what is ultimately \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d.\nRather, human knowing is among the ways organisms with\nevolved capacities for thought and language cope with problems. Minds,\nthen, are not passively observing the world; rather, they are actively\nadapting, experimenting, and innovating; ideas and theories are not\nrational fulcrums to get us beyond culture, but rather function\nexperimentally within culture and are evaluated on situated, pragmatic\nbases. Knowing is not the mortal\u2019s exercise of a \u201cdivine\nspark\u201d, either; for while knowing (or inquiry, to use\nDewey\u2019s term) includes calculative or rational elements, it is\nultimately informed by the body and emotions of the animal using it to\ncope.\n\nIn addition to academic life, Dewey comfortably wore the mantle of\npublic intellectual, infusing public issues with lessons found through\nphilosophy. He spoke on topics of broad moral significance, such as\nhuman freedom, economic alienation, race relations, women\u2019s\nsuffrage, war and peace, human freedom, and educational goals and\nmethods. Typically, discoveries made via public inquiries were\nintegrated back into his academic theories, and aided their revision.\nThis practice-theory-practice rhythm powered every area of\nDewey\u2019s intellectual enterprise, and perhaps explains why his\nphilosophical theories are still discussed, criticized, adapted, and\ndeployed in many academic and practical arenas. Use of Dewey\u2019s\nideas continues apace in aesthetics and art criticism, education,\nenvironmental policy, information theory, journalism, medicine,\npolitical theory, psychiatry, public administration, sociology, and of\ncourse in the philosophical areas to which Dewey contributed.\n",
