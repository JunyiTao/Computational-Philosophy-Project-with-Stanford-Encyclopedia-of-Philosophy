Kant\u2019s Pre-Critical Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nIn 1763, Kant entered an essay prize competition addressing the\nquestion of whether the first principles of metaphysics and morality\ncan be proved, and thereby achieve the same degree of certainty as\nmathematical truths. Though his essay was awarded second prize by the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in Berlin (losing to Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s \u201cOn Evidence in the Metaphysical\nSciences\u201d), it has nevertheless come to be known as Kant\u2019s\n\u201cPrize Essay\u201d. The Prize Essay was published by the\nAcademy in 1764 under the title \u201cInquiry Concerning the\nDistinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality\u201d\nand stands as a key text in Kant\u2019s pre-critical philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nIn the Prize Essay, Kant undertook to compare the methods of\nmathematics and metaphysics (Carson 1999; Sutherland 2010). He claimed\nthat \u201cthe business of mathematics\u2026is that of combining\nand comparing given concepts of magnitudes, which are clear and\ncertain, with a view to establishing what can be inferred from\nthem\u201d (2:278). He claimed further that this business is\naccomplished via an examination of figures or \u201cvisible\nsigns\u201d that provide concrete representations of universal\nconcepts that have been synthetically defined (Dunlop 2014, 2020). For\nexample, one defines the mathematical concept <trapezium> by\narbitrary combination of other concepts (\u201cfour straight lines\nbounding a plane surface so that the opposite sides are not parallel\nto each\n other\u201d[1]),\n accompanied by a \u201csensible sign\u201d that displays the\nrelations among the parts of all objects so defined. Definitions as\nwell as fundamental mathematical propositions (that space can only\nhave three dimensions, for example) must be \u201cexamined\nin concreto so that they come to be cognized\nintuitively\u201d, but such propositions can never be proved since\nthey are not inferred from other propositions (2:281). Theorems are\nestablished when simple cognitions are combined \u201cby means of\nsynthesis\u201d (2:282), as when, for instance, it is demonstrated\nthat the products of the segments formed by two chords intersecting\ninside a circle are equal. In the latter case, one proves a theorem\nabout any and all pairs of lines that intersect inside a circle not by\n\u201cdrawing all the possible lines which could intersect each other\nwithin [the circle]\u201d but rather by drawing only two lines, and\nidentifying the relationship that holds between them (2:278). The\n\u201cuniversal rule\u201d that results is inferred via a synthesis\namong the sensible signs that are displayed, and, as a result, among\nthe concepts that the sensible signs illustrate.\n\nKant concludes that the mathematical method cannot be applied to\nachieve philosophical (and, in particular, metaphysical) results, for\nthe primary reason that \u201cgeometers acquire their concepts by\nmeans of synthesis, whereas philosophers can only acquire\ntheir concepts by means of analysis\u2014and that completely\nchanges the method of thought\u201d (2:289). Yet at this pre-critical\nstage, he also concludes that, even lacking synthetic definitions of\nits primary concepts, \u201cmetaphysics is as much capable of the\ncertainty which is necessary to produce conviction as\nmathematics\u201d (2:296). (Later, in the critical period, Kant will\nexpand the notion of synthesis to describe not only the genesis and\ncombination of mathematical concepts, but also the act of unifying\nmanifold representations. He will also, of course, use the terms\n\u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201canalytic\u201d to distinguish two\nmutually exclusive ways in which the subject and predicate concepts\nrelate to one another in distinct judgments of any kind, and he will\nemphasize an expanded sense of this distinction that encompasses a\nmethodological contrast between two modes of argumentation, one\nsynthetic or progressive and the other analytic or regressive. These\nvarious senses of the analytic/synthetic distinction will be addressed\nbriefly, below.)\n\nIn the essays \u201cConcerning the Ultimate Ground of the\nDifferentiation of Directions in Space\u201d and \u201cOn the Form\nand Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World [Inaugural\nDissertation]\u201d of 1768 and 1770, respectively, Kant\u2019s\nthoughts about mathematics and its results begin to evolve in the\ndirection of his critical philosophy as he begins to recognize the\nrole that a distinct faculty of sensibility will play in an account of\nmathematical cognition (Carson 2004; Carson 2017; Posy 2020). In\nthese essays, he attributes the success of mathematical reasoning to\nits access to the \u201cprinciples of sensitive form\u201d and the\n\u201cprimary data of intuition\u201d, which results in \u201claws\nof intuitive cognition\u201d and \u201cintuitive judgments\u201d\nabout magnitude and extension. One such judgment serves to establish\nthe possibility of an object that is \u201cexactly equal and similar\nto another, but which cannot be enclosed in the same limits as that\nother, its incongruent counterpart\u201d (2:382) (Buroker\n1981; Van Cleve and Frederick 1991; Van Cleve 1999). Kant invokes\nsuch \u201cincongruent counterparts\u201d in \u201cDirections in\nspace\u201d to establish the orientability and actuality of a\nNewtonian-style absolute space, the object of geometry as he then\nunderstands it. He invokes the same example in the \u201cInaugural\nDissertation\u201d to establish that spatial relations \u201ccan\nonly be apprehended by a certain pure intuition\u201d and so show\nthat \u201cgeometry employs principles which are not only indubitable\nand discursive, but which also fall under the gaze of the mind.\u201d\nAs such, mathematical evidence is \u201cthe paradigm and the\nmeans of all evidence in the other sciences\u201d (2:403). (Later, in\nthe critical period\u2019s Prolegomena, he will invoke\nincongruent counterparts to establish the transcendental ideality of\nspace, thereby disavowing his earlier argument in support of absolute\nspace.)\n",
