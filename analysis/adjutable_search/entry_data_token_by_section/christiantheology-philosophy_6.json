    "main_text": "Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology || Incarnation and Christology\n2.2 Incarnation and Christology\n\nBy the close of the fourth century, the early Church had agreed that\nGod the Son, the second person of the Trinity, is no less divine than\nGod the Father. But this Trinitarian settlement led directly to\nanother, equally vexing question: how could Jesus of Nazareth, a human\nman, also be identical to God the Son? After another period of intense\ndebate, the Church defined the doctrine of the Incarnation, which\nasserts that Christ is one person (or one hypostasis) who\nexists in two natures, one fully human, the other fully divine (Tanner\n1990: 83; Kelly 1978: 338\u2013343). Yet, as with the doctrine of the\nTrinity, on its own, this conciliar terminology does not attempt to\nsolve the underlying philosophical problem.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, this problem has been called the\n\u201cfundamental philosophical problem of Christology\u201d. As\nRichard Cross puts it:\n\n\nhow is it that one and the same thing could be both divine (and thus,\non the face of it, necessary, and necessarily omniscient, omnipotent,\neternal, immutable, impassible, and impeccable) and human (and thus,\non the face of it, have the complements of all these properties)?\n(Cross 2009: 453)\n\n\nIn other words, the fundamental philosophical problem of Christology\nis the problem that arises when a single subject bears incompatible\nproperties. Christ seems to be both necessarily omniscient, as the\ndivine Son, the second person of the Trinity, and yet also limited in\nknowledge, as the human man, Jesus of Nazareth\u2014and so on for\nother divine and human attributes. Yet Christ is one person, not two:\nhe just is the divine Son and he just is Jesus of\nNazareth. On standard interpretations of logical consistency, nothing\ncan have logically incompatible properties at the same time and in the\nsame respect\u2014hence the problem.\n\nA venerable attempted solution to the problem of incompatible\nproperties makes use of grammatical modifiers to index Christological\npredications to their respective natures: Christ is limited in\nknowledge qua his human nature, and omniscient qua\nhis divine nature, where \u201cqua\u201d means \u201cwith respect\nto\u201d or \u201cin virtue of\u201d. More simply: Christ\nqua human is limited in knowledge; Christ qua divine\nis omniscient. The thought of Thomas Aquinas furnishes a foundational\nsource for this solution (Summa Theologiae 3.16.1\u201312;\nfor broader discussion of patristic and medieval uses, see Cross 2002:\n192\u2013205). Thomas Senor forcefully argues that this grammatical\nsolution does not work, for it cannot block the relevant entailment:\nsince the one Christ really is human and really is divine, it follows\nthat the one Christ is also limited in knowledge (qua human)\nand omniscient (qua divine), and so the contradiction remains\n(Senor 2002; see also Morris 1986).\n\nKenotic Christologies hold that at the point of incarnation, in order\nto become a human being, God the Son relinquished the divine\nattributes (Forrest 2000; Evans 2002, 2006). In a way, the kenotic\noption neatly solves the problem of incompatible properties, since\nChrist is not omnipotent and omniscient (etc.) at the same time as he\nis limited in power and knowledge. Kenotic Christologies have a\nvenerable pedigree, as well as some clear Biblical warrant\n(Philippians 2; for discussion see Evans 2006; McGuckin 1994 [2004:\n189]. But if omnipotence and omniscience are essential divine\nattributes, then it is not possible for God the Son to relinquish them\nduring the incarnation and regain them after the incarnation while\nremaining self-identical.\n\nCompositional Christologies try to solve the problem of incompatible\nproperties by appealing to the various \u201cparts\u201d that\ntogether compose the whole Christ. According to Thomas V. Morris,\nChrist is composed of the divine mind of God the Son, a human mind,\nand a human body. On his telling, Christ counts as fully divine,\nbecause he has a divine mind, which is the seat of his omnipotence and\nomniscience; he also counts as fully human because he has a human mind\nand a human body (Morris 1986). Morris seeks to dispel the\ncontradiction between divine and human attributes by revising our\nunderstanding of Christ\u2019s human attributes. Morris denies that\nhuman beings as such are essentially limited in power and knowledge\n(etc.). This move clears the way for attributing omnipotence and\nomniscience (etc.) even to the human, incarnate Christ, while also\ndenying that the human, incarnate Christ is limited in power and\nknowledge. Richard Swinburne (1994) defends a similar Christology, but\naccording to Swinburne, Christ is composed only of God the Son and a\nhuman body, which together constitute both a human way of thinking and\nacting and also a divine way of thinking and acting.\n\nOther compositional Christologies appeal to supposed mereological\nfacts about the incarnation to ground a more sophisticated version of\nthe \u201cqua move\u201d (discussed above). If God the Son has human\nparts and divine parts, then perhaps the whole mereological composite\ncan borrow properties from its constituent parts without violating the\nlaw of non-contradiction. Analogously, we might say that an apple is\nboth colored and not colored, since it is red (colored) with respect\nto its skin, but white (not colored) with respect to its flesh. There\nis a sense in which the apple as a whole is both colored and not\ncolored because it borrows properties from its parts. Perhaps\nsomething similar can be said about Christ, understood as a\nmereological composite of God the Son, a human body, and a human soul.\nLeading advocates of this sort of view include Brian Leftow (1992,\n2011) and Eleonore Stump (2002).\n\nTimothy Pawl (2014, 2016) seeks to dispel the fundamental problem by\nrevising the truth conditions of Christological predications like\n\u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d and \u201cChrist is limited in\nknowledge\u201d. According to Pawl, it is incorrect that \u201cbeing\nomniscient\u201d and \u201cbeing limited in knowledge\u201d are\nlogically contradictory properties at all. In fact, according to Pawl,\nonce we correctly understand their truth conditions, we can see that\nthey can both be true of the same subject after all. On Pawl\u2019s\naccount, \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d is true just in case\nChrist has a nature that is omniscient and \u201cChrist is limited in\nknowledge\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is\nlimited in knowledge. Because Christ, and only Christ (so far as we\nknow) has two natures, only Christ can be both omniscient and limited\nin knowledge. At first glance, Pawl\u2019s proposed solution might\nseem to be the \u201cqua move\u201d once again, in different dress.\nBut it is importantly different: Pawl is content to affirm the very\nentailments (e.g., \u201cChrist is omniscient and limited in\nknowledge\u201d) that the qua move seeks to block; he simply denies\nthat this entailment is logically contradictory.\n\nJc\u00a0Beall goes a step further and argues that some predicates\nreally are both true and false of Christ, because Christ really is a\ncontradictory being (2019, 2021). Beall defends a contradictory\nChristology because he accepts a non-standard model of logic, one on\nwhich some predicates can be neither true nor false of a subject, and\nother predicates can be both true and false of a subject. According to\nBeall, logic as such\u2014that is, his favored account of\nlogic\u2014is neutral about whether any given substantive theory\ncontains true contradictions. To determine whether it does, we must\nexamine the theory\u2019s axiomatic statements. When we examine the\naxioms of orthodox Christology, according to Beall, we find that they\ninclude authoritative conciliar statements that are most naturally\nread as contradictory\u2014e.g., \u201cChrist is passible and\nimpassible\u201d (2019: 415). Rather than revise or reinterpret such\nstatements so that they are not contradictory, we should accept that\nthey are.\n",
