    "main_text": "Three Motives for, and Types of, Consequentializing || Earnest Consequentializing\n3.1 Earnest Consequentializing\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen what is perhaps the original, and most\ncommon, motivation for consequentializing: to avoid\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive deontic verdicts while\nretaining what\u2019s most intuitively compelling about it\u2014its\nact-consequentialism (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1477). Following Sergio\nTenenbaum (2014), I\u2019ll call those with this motive for\nconsequentializing earnest consequentializers. Earnest\nconsequentializers (e.g., Sen 1983 and Portmore 2011) give\nwhat\u2019s known as the intuitive argument for\nconsequentializing (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1477):\n\nOn the one hand, there is something intuitively compelling about\nutilitarianism: its act-consequentialism.\nOn the other hand, standard versions of non-consequentialism avoid\nmost, if not all, of the counterintuitive deontic verdicts associated\nwith utilitarianism. Still, they do so at the cost of abandoning\nact-consequentialism.\nThus, by consequentializing standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, we can produce an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that retains what\u2019s most compelling about\nutilitarianism while avoiding most, if not all, of the\ncounterintuitive deontic verdicts associated with it.\nAnd, in doing so, nothing nearly as compelling is lost.\nTherefore, by consequentializing standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, we can produce a theory that\u2019s more\nintuitively attractive than both utilitarianism and standard versions\nof non-consequentialism.\n\n\nEarnest consequentializing is made possible because theory selection\nis underdetermined by the data that our theories seek to explain (see\nDuhem 1914 [1954]; Quine 1951 [1953]; and Baumann 2019). To\nillustrate, consider two moral theories: utilitarian theological\nvoluntarism and utilitarian act-consequentialism. These\ntwo explain the same data set: that all and only acts that maximize\nhedonic utility are permissible. However, their explanations are quite\ndifferent. Utilitarian theological voluntarism holds that the\nexplanation lies with the fact that the ultimate right-making feature\nof an act is that it accords with God\u2019s will along with the fact\n(as they see it) that God is perfectly good and, so, wills each of us\nto maximize hedonic utility (see Paley 1802). Utilitarian\nact-consequentialism, by contrast, holds that the explanation lies\nwith the fact that the ultimate right-making feature of an act is that\nits outcome is not outranked by that of any available alternative\nalong with the fact (as they see it) that an act\u2019s outcome is\nnot outranked by that of any available alternative if and only if it\nmaximizes hedonic utility. Thus, the moral data (i.e., the given set\nof deontic verdicts) can be explained either in non-consequentialist\nterms or in act-consequentialist terms. And, to consequentialize, we\njust need to opt for the latter.\n\nThe fact that data underdetermines theory selection also makes\nKantianizing possible. And, so, just as we can\nconsequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we can Kantianize a\nnon-Kantian theory (Hurley 2013; Sachs 2010). For instance, if we\nwanted to Kantianize utilitarianism, we need only combine Kantianism\n(which, on at least one interpretation, is the view that the ultimate\nright-making feature of an act is that it shows the proper respect for\nhumanity) with the assumption that an act shows the proper respect for\nhumanity if and only if it maximizes hedonic utility. Indeed, the\npoint generalizes: for any moral theory X that holds that the\nultimate right-making feature of an act is that it is F, we\ncan X-ize a non-X theory that holds instead that it\nis G simply by combining X\u2019s account of the\nultimate right-maker with the assumption that an act is F if\nand only if it is G. (This will be possible so long as\nF and G are such that it\u2019s possible that an\nact is F if and only if it is G.)\n\nWe can even theologically voluntarize a\nnon-theological-voluntarist theory such as Kantianism. To do so, we\nneed only combine theological voluntarism\u2019s view that the\nultimate right-making feature of an act is that it accords with\nGod\u2019s will with the assumption that an act accords with\nGod\u2019s will if and only if it shows the proper respect for\nhumanity. The result is a version of theological voluntarism (viz.,\nKantian theological voluntarism) that yields the same set of\ndeontic verdicts that Kantianism delivers.\n\nBut if we can account for the moral data on various types of theories,\nwhy opt to do so in terms of act-consequentialism rather than\nnon-consequentialism? In other words, why consequentialize rather\nthan, say, Kantianize? The earnest consequentializer answers that it\nis because there is something uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism (what\u2019s often called \u201cthe Compelling\nIdea\u201d) and nothing nearly so compelling about Kantianism or any\nother non-consequentialist theory. This claim is, of course,\ncontroversial, but we\u2019ll address this controversy both in the\nnext section and in\n section 4.1\n below.\n",
