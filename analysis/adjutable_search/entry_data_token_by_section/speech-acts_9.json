    "main_text": "Aspects of Illocutionary Force || Direct and Indirect Force\n3.4 Direct and Indirect Force\n\n\nI cannot slow the expansion of the universe or convince you of the\ntruth of a claim by saying that I am doing so. However, these two\ncases differ in that the latter, but not the former, is a\ncharacteristic aim of a speech act. One characteristic aim of\nassertion is the production of belief in an addressee, whereas there\nis no speech act one of whose characteristic aims is the slowing of\nthe universe\u2019s expansion. A type of speech act can have a\ncharacteristic aim without each speech act of that type being issued\nwith that aim: Speakers sometimes make assertions without aiming to\nproduce belief in anyone, even themselves. Instead, the view that a\nspeech act-type has a characteristic aim is akin to the view that a\nbiological trait has a function. The characteristic role of wings is\nto aid in flight even though some flightless creatures are winged.\n\n\nAustin called these characteristic aims of speech\nacts perlocutions (1962, p. 101). I can both urge and\npersuade you to shut the door, yet the former is an illocution while\nthe latter is a perlocution. How can we tell the difference? We can do\nso by noting that under the right conditions, one can urge just by\nsaying and speaker meaning, \u201cI hereby urge you to shut the door,\u201d while there\nare no circumstances in which I can persuade you just by saying,\n\u201cI hereby persuade you to shut the door.\u201d A characteristic\naim of urging is, nevertheless, the production of a resolution to act\n(1962, p. 107). Cohen (1973) develops the idea of perlocutions as\ncharacteristic aims of speech acts.\n\n\nPerlocutions are characteristic aims of one or more illocution, but\nare not themselves illocutions. Nevertheless, one speech act can be\nperformed by means of the performance of another. For instance, my\nremark that you are standing on my foot is normally taken as, in\naddition, a demand that you move; my question whether you can pass the\nsalt is normally taken as a request that you do so. These are examples\nof so-called indirect speech acts (Searle 1979). Phrases that\nare commonly used in service of indirect speech acts are, \u2018Would\nyou mind terribly if I\u2026,\u2019 \u2018Might I\nsuggest\u2026,\u2019 and \u2018It seems to me that\u2026\u2019,\nor simply \u2018please\u2019, as in \u2018Can you pass the salt,\nplease?\u2019 Observe that this last sentence, with its appended\ntag-question, cannot be interpreted as a request for information\n(about the addressee\u2019s salt-passing abilities), but can only be\nunderstood as a request. Asher and Lascarides (2001) provide a formal\nmodel of indirect speech acts on which some are conventionalized while\nothers require Gricean reasoning for their interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nWhile indirect communication is ubiquitous, indirect speech acts are\nless common than might first appear. In asking whether you intend to\nquit smoking, I might be taken as well to be suggesting that you\nquit. However, while the embattled smoker might jump to this\ninterpretation, we do well to consider what evidence would mandate\nit. After all, while I probably would not have asked whether you\nintended to quit smoking unless I hoped you would quit, I can evince\nsuch a hope without performing the speech act of suggesting. Evincing\na psychological state, even if done intentionally, arguably does not\nconstitute a speech act. Instead, intentionally evincing a\npsychological state may be understood as simply expressing that\nstate (See Green 2020, ch. 2). \n\n\nWhether, in addition to a given speech act, I am also performing an\nindirect speech act would seem to depend on my intentions. My question\nwhether you can pass the salt is also a request that you do so only if\nI intend to be so understood. What is more, this intention must be\nfeasibly discernible on the part of one\u2019s audience. Even if, in\nremarking on the fine weather, I intend as well to request that you\npass the salt, I will not have issued a request unless I have made\nthat intention manifest in some way.\n\n\nHow might I do this? One way is by making an inference to the best\nexplanation. Perhaps the best explanation of my asking whether you can\npass the salt is that I mean to be requesting that you do so, and\nperhaps the best explanation of my remarking that you are standing on\nmy foot, particularly if I use a stentorian tone of voice, is that I\nmean to be demanding that you desist. By contrast, it is doubtful that\nthe best explanation of my asking whether you intend to quit smoking\nis that I intend to suggest that you do so. Another explanation at\nleast as plausible is my hope, or expression of hope, that you do\nso. Bertolet 1994 develops a more skeptical position than that\nsuggested here, arguing that any alleged case of an indirect speech\nact can be construed just as an indication, by means of contextual\nclues, of the speaker\u2019s intentional state\u2014hope, desire, etc., as\nthe case may be. Postulation of a further speech act beyond what has\nbeen (relatively) explicitly performed is, he contends, explanatorily\nunmotivated. McGowan et al. (2009) reply by offering three\nconditions they take to be sufficient for a case of what they term\nlinguistic communication. They would also argue that in, for instance,\nthe smoking case, the speaker meets those three conditions, and thus\ncounts as suggesting that the addressee quit smoking. Bertolet (2017)\nreplies that these three conditions are not sufficient for an instance\nof speaker meaning, and given that (as we have seen) speaker meaning\nis a necessary condition for (non-conventional) speech acts, concludes\nthat McGowan et al. have not established that the cases that\nconcern them are indirect speech acts.\n\n\nThese considerations suggest that indirect speech acts, if they do\noccur at all, can be explained within the framework of conversational\nimplicature\u2013that process by which we mean more (and on some\noccasions less) than we say, but in a way not due exclusively to the\nconventional meanings of our words. Conversational implicature, too,\ndepends both upon communicative intentions and the availability of\ninference to the best explanation (Grice, 1989). In fact,\nSearle\u2019s 1979 influential account of indirect speech acts is\ncouched in terms of conversational implicature (although he does not\nuse this phrase). The study of speech acts is in this respect\nintertwined with the study of conversations; we return to this theme\nin Section \n6.[10]\n",
