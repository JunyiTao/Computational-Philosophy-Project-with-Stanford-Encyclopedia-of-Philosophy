    "main_text": "Doing Without Justification? || Causal Theories of Knowledge\n6.2 Causal Theories of Knowledge\n\nAnother move in a similar spirit to K-Reliabilism replaces the\njustification clause in the JTB theory with a condition requiring a\ncausal connection between the belief and the fact\n believed;[24]\n this is the approach of Goldman (1967,\n 1976).[25]\n Goldman\u2019s own causal theory is a sophisticated one; we will not\nengage with its details here. See Goldman\u2019s papers. Instead,\nconsider a simplified causal theory of knowledge, which illustrates\nthe main motivation behind causal theories.\n\n\nSimple Causal Theory of Knowledge:\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS\u2019s belief that p is caused by the fact that\np.\n\n\n\nDo approaches like Simple K-Reliabilism or the Simple Causal Theory\nfare any better than the JTB theory with respect to Gettier cases?\nAlthough some proponents have suggested they do\u2014see e.g.,\nDretske 1985: 179; Plantinga 1993: 48\u2014many of the standard\ncounterexamples to the JTB theory appear to refute these views as\nwell. Consider again the case of the barn facades. Henry sees a real\nbarn, and that\u2019s why he believes there is a barn nearby. This\nbelief is formed by perceptual processes, which are by-and-large\nreliable: only rarely do they lead him into false beliefs. So it looks\nlike the case meets the conditions of Simple K-Reliabilism just as\nmuch as it does those of the JTB theory. It is also a counterexample\nto the causal theory, since the real barn Henry perceives is causally\nresponsible for his belief. There is reason to doubt, therefore, that\nshifting from justification to a condition like reliability will\nescape the Gettier\n problem.[26]\n Gettier cases seem to pose as much of a problem for K-reliabilism and\ncausal theories as for the JTB account. Neither theory, unless amended\nwith a clever \u201cdegettiering\u201d clause, succeeds in stating\nsufficient conditions for\n knowledge.[27]\n",
