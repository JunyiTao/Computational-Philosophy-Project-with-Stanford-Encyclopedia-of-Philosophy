    "main_text": "Tillers and Soldiers: Ruling the People\n3. Tillers and Soldiers: Ruling the People\n\nThe Book of Lord Shang is the text that addresses most\nsystematically the issue of major concern to the Warring States-period\nrulers: how can the state survive in the age of perennial war? The\nanswer\u2014anticipating modern ideas of \u201ctotal\nwar\u201d\u2014was total utilization of the state\u2019s material\nand human resources for the military success. Practically, this meant\ndirecting the entire population to two essential occupations:\nagriculture and warfare, which, in the Book of Lord Shang,\nare jointly dubbed \u201cthe One\u201d (yi \u58f9). Then,\n\u201cwhen an army is dispatched, provisions are ample, and resources\nare abundant; when the army is at rest, the people are working, and\nthe accumulated [surplus] suffices for a long time\u201d (Book of\nLord Shang 6.2, \u201cCalculating the land\u201d).\n\nTo cause every subject engage in utterly unattractive tasks of tilling\nand fighting, Shang Yang recommends the ruler to manipulate his\nsubjects\u2019 natural dispositions. The text explains:\n\n\nHuman beings have likes and dislikes; hence, the people can be ruled.\nThe ruler must investigate likes and dislikes. Likes and dislikes are\nthe root of rewards and penalties. The disposition of the people is to\nlike ranks and emoluments and to dislike punishments and penalties.\nThe ruler sets up the two in order to guide the people\u2019s will\nand to establish whatever he desires. (Book of Lord Shang\n9.3, \u201cImplementing laws\u201d)\n\n\nTo properly motivate the people, the ruler should employ a combination\nof positive (rewards, ranks, emoluments) and negative (punishments,\npenalties) incentives. The institutions of the state (fa in\nits broadest meaning) should be designed so as to channel social\nforces toward desirable social and political ends. This approach,\nwhich curiously resembles modern ideas of social engineering (Pines\n2016b), is the hallmark of Shang Yang\u2019s intellectual\naudacity.\n",
