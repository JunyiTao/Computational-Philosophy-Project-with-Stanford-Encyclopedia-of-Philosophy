    "main_text": "Does Domination Require the Exercise of Power? || Does Character Matter after All?\n3.2 Does Character Matter after All?\n\nThere are two primary lines of objection to the claim that only a\nchange in how power relations are structured can check domination,\nrather than changes to the outcome of the relation or to the character\nof the empowered. The first is that it fails to capture realities of\nwhat the dominated really object to; the second is that it leads to\nsignificant over-generalization.\n\nNo one denies that victims of power object to the outcomes of its use,\nand not merely to their initial vulnerability to that power.\n(Certainly, neorepublicans want to say that both are\nobjectionable.) But if we insist that domination refers properly only\nto the structure of a power relation, and not to outcomes of that\nrelation, we may have a difficult time explaining the standard use of\ndomination to refer to overwhelming power wielded against the\ndefenseless. Suppose Columbus had merely sailed around the margins of\nthe \u201cNew World\u201d without making landfall, and that his\npower to exploit and destroy native cultures was never exercised. Is\nthis counterfactual history still a story of European domination? If\nnot, it is tempting to identify European domination with the actual\nharm inflicted on people who were not equipped to resist them (Katz\n2017).\n\nThere is reason to think, too, that the dominated sometimes have\ncomplaints specifically about the character of the powerful. This\nissue has been revisited in the work of Christopher Lebron (2013) and\nMelvin Rogers (forthcoming). Rogers especially insists that theories\nof domination influenced by neorepublicanism overplay the irrelevance\nof character to dominating power. His recent work on black American\nrepublicans like Martin Delany (1852 [1968]), Hosea Easton (1837\n[1999]), Maria W. Stewart (1987), David Walker (1829 [2003]), reveals\na contrasting emphasis on the \u201ccomportment\u201d of white\nAmericans. Opposing race-based systems of domination requires not just\n\u201cfreedom from the arbitrary power\u201d of white Americans, but\na \u201ctransformation of the system of cultural value in which\nblacks occupy a lower position of worth\u201d (Rogers, forthcoming).\nThis transformation requires not only the external checks on\ndomination achievable by legal reforms, but a transformation in the\nhearts of white Americans. Rogers argues that neorepublican theories\nof domination are formed by resistance to political slavery,\nwhere the essential humanity of the slave is not in question; unlike\nchattel slavery, which was built on and maintained by an\nideological commitment to white supremacy and black inferiority. Legal\nreforms may be sufficient to counter political slavery: they represent\na turn of the legal order toward closer alignment with the already\nacknowledged value of the enslaved. However, legal reforms alone,\nwhile necessary, are not enough when this value is systematically\ndenied.\n",
