It should be noted that according to the terminology\nused in this article, although a haecceity would be an individual\nessence, it would not be a non-trivial individual essence.)\nHowever, it is not obvious that the belief in bare identities requires\nthe acceptance of haecceities. One can apparently hold that transworld\nidentities may be \u2018bare\u2019 without holding that they are\nconstituted by any properties at all, even unanalysable haecceities\n(cf. Lewis 1986, 225; Adams 1979, 6\u20137). Thus we should\ndistinguish what is standardly known as \u2018haecceitism\u2019\n(roughly, the view that there may be bare identities across possible\nworlds in the sense of identities that do not supervene on qualitative\nproperties) from the belief in haecceities (the belief that\nindividuals have unanalysable non-qualitative properties that\nconstitute their being the individuals that they are). (For more on\nthe use of the term \u2018haecceitism\u2019 see Lewis 1986, Ch. 4,\nSection 4; Adams 1979; Kaplan 1975, Section IV; also the separate\nentry on Haecceitism. For the history of the term\n\u2018haecceity\u2019, see the entry on Medieval Theories of\nHaecceity.)\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that to believe in \u2018bare\u2019\ntransworld identities, in the sense under discussion here, is not to\nbelieve in \u2018bare particulars\u2019, if to be a bare particular\nis to be an entity devoid of (non-trivial) essential properties. As\nthe arguments discussed in Sections 4.1\u20134.2 above demonstrate, a\ncommitment to a \u2018bare\u2019 (or \u2018ungrounded\u2019)\ndifference in the identities of two individuals A and\nB in different possible worlds (two human beings, or two\ntrees, for example) does not imply that those individuals have no\nnon-trivial essential properties. All it implies is that A\nand B do not differ in their non-trivial essential\nproperties\u2014and hence that, although there may well be\nnon-trivial necessary conditions for being A in any possible\nworld, and non-trivial necessary conditions for being B in\nany possible world, there are no non-trivial necessary conditions for\nbeing A that are not also necessary conditions for being\nB, and vice versa. (Cf. Adams\u2019s \u2018Moderate\nHaecceitism\u2019 (1979, 24\u201326).)\n",
