    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Creation\n3.2 Creation\n\n\nThis is, however, only a part of al-Kindi\u2019s view on divine\ncausation. Because, as we have seen, al-Kindi thinks that to be a thing\nof a certain kind is to be one in a certain way, he infers that the\ntrue One is the cause of being as well as unity (see further Adamson\n2002b). In particular, he believes that God is an \u201cagent\u201d\nor efficient cause. This view is expressed in a succinct text (possibly\na fragment from a longer, lost work) headed with the title On the\nTrue, First, Complete Agent and the Deficient Agent that is\nMetaphorically [an Agent] (Abu Rida 1950, 182\u20134). The\ntext begins as follows:\n\n\nWe say that the true, first act is the bringing-to-be of beings from\nnon-being. It is clear that this act is proper to God, the exalted, who\nis the end of every cause. For the bringing-to-be of beings from\nnon-being belongs to no other. And this act is a proper characteristic\n[called] by the name \u201corigination.\u201d\n\n\nAl-Kindi goes on to explain that whereas God is a \u201ctrue\u201d\nagent, since He is a cause of being and acts without being acted upon,\nall other agents are only \u201cmetaphorically\u201d agents, because\nthey both act and are acted upon. The force of the term\n\u201cmetaphorical\u201d here is the same as it was in On First\nPhilosophy: just as created things are both many and one, and thus\nnot \u201ctruly\u201d one, so they are both passive and active, and\nthus not \u201ctruly\u201d agents.\n\n\nThis short text raises two interesting questions about how al-Kindi\nconceived of divine action. First, what does he have in mind when he\ndescribes God\u2019s agency as being mediated by the action of\n\u201cmetaphorical agents\u201d (God \u201cis the proximate cause\nfor the first effect, and a cause through an intermediary for His\neffects that are after the first effect\u201d)? Second, what is\ninvolved in \u201cbringing being to be from non-being\u201d?\n\n\nRegarding the first question, one might suppose that al-Kindi is\nfollowing Neoplatonic texts, and that he has in mind a mediated\nemanation of effects from the first principle. If this is right, then\nthe \u201cfirst effect\u201d will be the \u201cworld of the\nintellect\u201d mentioned in other Kindian texts (e.g. the\nDiscourse on the Soul, repeating this phrase from the\nTheology of Aristotle). This is supported by a non-committal\nremark in On First Philosophy that \u201cone might think the\nintellect is the first multiple\u201d (Rashed and Jolivet 1998, 87).\nBut it seems at least as likely that the \u201cfirst effect\u201d\nmentioned here is the world of the heavens: by creating the heavens and\nsetting them in motion, God indirectly brings about things in the\nsublunary world (see further below, 5.2). This would be a more\nAristotelian version of the idea that divine causation is mediated.\n\n\nRegarding the second question, the idea that God is an agent\ncause of being may likewise seem at first to be a departure\nfrom Aristotle. But in fact Neoplatonist authors like Ammonius had\nexplicitly argued that Aristotle\u2019s God was an efficient cause of\nbeing, not just a final cause of motion. And a passage in On the\nQuantity of Aristotle\u2019s Books \u2014 the aforementioned\ndiscussion of Koran 36: 79\u201382 \u2014 understands creation on the\nmodel of Aristotelian change, in which something passes from one\ncontrary to another. In the case of creation, one contrary is\n\u201cnon-being\u201d and the other \u201cbeing.\u201d Al-Kindi\u2019s\ndiscussion of this has parallels in ninth century theological\ndiscussions of creation (see Adamson 2003). But his main source,\nsurprisingly, is Ammonius\u2019 student John Philoponus, a Christian\nNeoplatonist who had also spoken of creation as bringing something to\nbe \u201cfrom non-being.\u201d What separates al-Kindi and\nPhiloponus from Aristotle is their idea that this kind of\n\u201cchange\u201d from non-being to being requires no subject. For\nexample, for there to be a change from non-white to white, there must\nbe some subject or substrate for both the privation of the whiteness\nand the whiteness itself (for instance the fence that goes from being\nnon-white to being white when it is painted). God, by contrast, can\nbring about being ex nihilo, with no subject for the change.\nAl-Kindi emphasizes also that God\u2019s creative act requires no time to\nbe realized.\n",
