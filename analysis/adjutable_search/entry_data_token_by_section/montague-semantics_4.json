    "main_text": "Components of Montague Semantics || Intensionality and Tautologies\n2.4 Intensionality and Tautologies\n\nMontague defined the denotation of a sentence as a function from\npossible worlds and moments of time to truth values. Such a function\nis called an \u2018intension\u2019. As he said (Montague 1970a,\n220), this made it possible to deal with the semantics of common\nphenomena such as modifiers, e.g. in Necessarily the father of\nCain is Adam. Its denotation cannot be obtained from the truth\nvalue of The father of Cain is Adam: one needs to know the\ntruth value for other possible worlds and moments of time. The\nintensional approach also made it possible to deal with several\nclassical puzzles. Two examples from Montague 1973 are: The\ntemperature is rising, which should not be analyzed as stating\nthat some number is rising; and John wishes to catch a fish and\neat it, which should not be analyzed as implying that John has a\nparticular fish in mind.\n\nIntensional semantics has been criticized for the fact that all\ntautologies get the same meaning (are synonymous). Indeed, a tautology\nas John is ill or he is not ill gets as intension the\nfunction that constantly yields true, and the same holds for\nother tautologies. If one is interested in discriminating semantically\nbetween tautologies, then a refinement of the notions\n\u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018equivalence\u2019 is needed:\n\u2018meaning\u2019 should see distinctions between tautologies, and\n\u2018equivalence\u2019 should be sensitive for the thus refined\nnotion of meaning. The oldest proposals to account for this problem\ngoes back to Carnap (1947, \u00a714) and was later taken up by Lewis\n(1970, sec. 5): propositions are structured by including in their\nmeanings also the meanings of their parts. Then indeed Green grass\nis green and White snow is white have different\nmeanings. However, lexical synonyms still pose a problem. Since\nwoodchuck and groundhog are names for the same\nspecies, John believes that Phil is a groundhog is, under\nthis view, equivalent with John believes that Phil is a\nwoodchuck. One could consider belief contexts a separate problem,\nbut most authors see it as part of the problem of equivalence of all\ntautologies.\n\nLater several proposals for dealing with this have been developed;\nsurveys can be found in B\u00e4uerle and Cresswell (2003), Fox and\nLappin (2005), and Egr\u00e9 (2021). The latter authors explain that\nthere are two strategies: the first is to introduce impossible worlds\nin which woodchuck and groundhog are not equivalent,\nand the second is to introduce an entailment relation with the\nproperty that identity does not follow from reciprocal entailment. Fox\nand Lappin follow the second strategy.\n",
