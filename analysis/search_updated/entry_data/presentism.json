So understood,\npresentism is primarily an ontological doctrine; it\u2019s a view\nabout what exists, absolutely and unrestrictedly.

    "main_text": "\n1. What is Presentism?\n\nAs a bare ontological thesis, presentism can be understood as\nP:\n\n(P)Only\npresent things exist.\n\n\nP is a claim about what exists (what there is), absolutely and\nunrestrictedly. As a description of presentism, it\u2019s both\nmainstream and minimal. That is, many would accept P,\nor its logical equivalents, as a statement of presentism (e.g.,\nHinchliff 1996: 123; Crisp 2004: 15; Hawley 2014: 48; Emery 2019:\n963), but they would acknowledge that more needs to be said to\narticulate a complete theory. To flesh out the ontological thesis,\nP is often contrasted with two other ontological\ntheses: an opposing view of time, eternalism (\u201cpast,\npresent, and future things exist\u201d), and an analogical view in\nmodality, actualism (\u201conly actual things exist\u201d)\n(see, e.g., Adams 1986: 321; Hinchliff 1996: 123\u20134; Sider 1999:\n326, 2001: 11\u201312; Noonan 2013: 219\u201320, 2019: 490\u20133).\nTheodore Sider, for instance, neatly articulates this apparent\nmainstream characterisation:\n\n\nPresentism is the doctrine that only the present is real. \u2026 A\npresentist thinks that everything is present; more generally, that,\nnecessarily, it is always true that everything is (then) present.\n\nPresentism is the temporal analogue of the modal doctrine of\nactualism, according to which everything is actual. The\nopposite view in the philosophy of modality is possibilism,\naccording to which nonactual things exist; its temporal analogue is\neternalism, according to which there are such things as\nmerely past and merely future entities. (1999: 325\u20136)\n\nPresentists and eternalists make competing claims about temporal\nontology. According to presentism, only present things exist.\nAccording to eternalism, past and future things, such as dinosaurs and\nhuman outposts on Mars, exist as well. These are theories about what\nthere is, just like actualism, possibilism, Platonism, nominalism,\nMeinongianism, idealism, materialism, theism, atheism\u2026 (2006:\n75)\n\n\nPresentists and the rest thus disagree about what exists. When\nconfronted with W.V. Quine\u2019s (1948) three Anglo-Saxon\nmonosyllables\u2014\u201cWhat is there?\u201d\u2014presentists\nhave a simple and distinctive reply: \u201cOnly what\u2019s\npresent\u201d. Non-presentists demur. Eternalists say that there are\npast and future things too. Growing block theorists\n(\u201cno-futurists\u201d) say that there are past and present\nthings, but no future things. On the standard, mainstream picture,\nwhat\u2019s distinctive about presentism is determined primarily by\nthe distinct claims made about temporal ontology. For a brief, general\noverview of this terrain, see the entry on\n time\n (\u00a76).\n\nThe ontological thesis, P, requires supplementation.\nConsider, for example, a possible world, w, at which the\ngrowing block theory of time is true. At the first moment of\nw, P is true. There exists only the first\nmoment and that moment is present; there are no other moments, and so\nthe past hasn\u2019t yet come to exist. Later on, it will become\nclear that w isn\u2019t a presentist world, even though it\nseems initially to satisfy P: at the first moment,\nonly present things exist. For this reason, when being more\nforthcoming with a definition of their view, moving beyond mere\nslogan, presentism might more perspicuously be rendered as a view that\nis always true, if true at all (Crisp 2003: 215; 2004: 19,\nfn.6; Deasy 2017: 380). So, presentism amounts to the claim that:\n\n(PA)\nAlways, only present things exist.\n\n\nFurthermore, along the modal dimension, presentism might be thought of\nas a view that is necessarily true, if true at all (Hestevold\n& Carter 2002: 499; Markosian 2004: 47, fn.1; Ingram 2016: 2868).\nThus:\n\n(PAN)Necessarily,\nit\u2019s always the case that, only present\nthings exist.\n\n\nHowever, although presentists sometimes make this move, there\u2019s\nvery little discussion in the literature as to whether\nPAN is preferable to PA (cf. Crisp\n2003: 215) and, if so, what would justify that preference. (One might\nthink that metaphysical theses are necessarily true, if true at all.\nBut this thought is not directly connected to the debate about time\nand change, and it is certainly not uncontroversial, so we set it\naside here.) In what follows, reflecting the lack of discussion, we\nremain neutral on whether PA or PAN\nis preferred. We follow the wider literature in typically stating\npresentism as P, rather than PA,\nthough we take it that something at least as strong as\nPA is intended.\n\nMore modifications may be required. First, strictly speaking, on this\ncharacterization, presentism is a thesis that denies the existence of\natemporal or timeless entities, that is, entities\nthat aren\u2019t present (but aren\u2019t past or future either,\nbecause they are not in time). This appears to rule out the existence\nof abstract entities, on the presumption that abstracta are timeless.\n[See the entry on\n  abstract objects .]\n This also appears to rule out the existence of a timeless god, which\nis problematic for those that accept \u201cdivine timelessness\u201d\nor \u201cdivine atemporality\u201d. [See the entry on\n  eternity in Christian thought,\n esp. \u00a74.1.] One or both of these may be a step too far for some\npresentists. Hence, we might be pressed to modify P\nand restrict it to concrete or physical objects. We\u2019re not\nforced to make that move, however, since P only rules\nout such entities insofar as they are understood as timeless.\nPresentism is compatible with the existence of abstracta, for\ninstance, so long as such entities exist now (exist within time). In\nany case, timeless abstracta are inconsistent with\nP, but (as is clear) this needn\u2019t be of too\nmuch concern. It is unclear how much would be lost from the core of\npresentism if we coupled P to timeless abstracta or a\ntimeless god. For some discussion of additional problems with\ncombining presentism with divine atemporality, see Leftow (2018).\n\nSecond, presentism isn\u2019t merely the thesis that only present\nthings exist. This isn\u2019t the full extent of the position.\nWithout qualification, P is consistent with the view\nthat reality is static (or \u201cfrozen\u201d) and that time\ndoesn\u2019t really pass. But reality isn\u2019t that way; our\nreality is dynamic. Hence, a full and proper account of presentism\nrequires more detail. Typically, presentism is thought to include the\nadditional claim that various things have existed and that others will\nexist: Sennacherib\u2019s gardens at Nineveh, Boudica, and Marie\nCurie all existed, but exist no longer; and, though we exist,\nalongside the Taj Mahal, Taylor Swift, and you (dear reader), all of\nus will cease to exist at some future time(s), to be replaced by other\nthings, each of which will go out of existence in their turn. Thus,\npresentism commits us to there being a change in what exists over\ntime, a change in what\u2019s present. Frequently (although not\nexclusively), presentists describe this change in terms of temporal\npassage\u2014the passing of time\u2014or, at least, as closely\nrelated to it. So, presentism can be understood as the following\nconjunction:\n\n(PC)\n(i) Only present things exist,\n\n&\n\n(ii) What\u2019s present changes.\n\n\nFor those who state presentism explicitly in this way, see Price\n(2011: 277), Miller (2013: 346), and Leininger (2015: 726), amongst\nothers.\n\nFurther, since presentism marks a difference between the present, on\none hand, and the past and future, on the other, it\u2019s typical\n(although, again, not universal) to see presentism described as a\nversion of the \u201cA theory\u201d of time (e.g., Craig 2000;\nZimmerman 2008; Deasy 2017). Here we understand the \u201cA\ntheory\u201d as something like the union of the following two theses:\nthere are genuine, fundamental or \u201cirreducible\u201d properties\nof at least some of past, present and future (i.e., so-called \u201cA\nqualities\u201d or \u201cA properties\u201d); and, time passes (see\nthe entry on\n  time:\n \u00a75). For recent explorations of presentism without the A theory\n(or, without A qualities), see Rasmussen (2012, 2015) and Correia\n& Rosenkranz (2015).\n\nThus far, our focus has been on saying what presentism is. And, as we\nsee it, we\u2019ve reported faithfully what\u2019s said typically\nabout the view in the contemporary literature. But the recent history\nof presentism, the view as it appears in the earlier parts of the\n20th century, is a little less clear. As far as we know,\nRobert Adams is the first to use the name \u201cpresentism\u201d in\nprint (in 1986), though he implies that he isn\u2019t the first to\nname it\u2014he writes:\n\n\n[a] reduction is offered by a view that is sometimes called\n\u201cpresentism\u201d by analogy with \u201cactualism\u201d.\n(1986: 321)\n\n\nBefore 1986, matters are unclear. Many (rightly) point to Arthur Prior\nas an important and historically significant adherent of presentism.\nWe agree that Prior endorses something like the presentist\u2019s\nontological thesis, P, when he writes:\n\n\nthe present simply is the real considered in relation to two\nspecies of unreality, namely the past and the future. (1970: 245)\n\n\nBut we think that it\u2019s less obvious that Prior\u2019s complete\nview on time is presentism, as above (see e.g., Fine 1977;\nButterfield 1983; Le Poidevin 1991: 36\u201340; Jakobsen 2011). [For\ndetail on Prior\u2019s life and work, see the entry on\n  Arthur Prior .]\n There are others after Prior, but before Adams (1986) or Hinchliff\n(1988), who also appear to endorse P, such\nas Routley (1980). Similarly, we take no stand here on whether such\nphilosophers are presentists or on what we should say about\nthese definitional debates (cf. Tallant & Ingram 2021).\n\nThis concludes our opening sketch. Presentism is the view that only\npresent things exist and what\u2019s present changes (i.e., things\nchange, time passes); and, it\u2019s a version of the A theory of\ntime. Now, why believe it?\n2. Motivating Presentism\n\nThe most frequently cited reason given for endorsing\npresentism\u2014or, at least, treating it as worthy of serious\ncritical consideration\u2014trades upon some variant of the claim\nthat it\u2019s the \u201cintuitive\u201d or \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d view of time (e.g., Bigelow 1996: 36; Sider 2001: 11;\nMarkosian 2004: 48; De Clercq 2006: 386; Tallant 2009b: 407; Ingram\n2019: 39\u201343). Many friends agree, and more than a few foes\nconcede, that there\u2019s something compelling about the ideas that\npresent things really exist, whilst past and future things don\u2019t\nexist, and that some things begin to exist, and other things cease to\nexist (cf. Sullivan 2012: 153\u201365). Some who look to defend\npresentism will rest there with the bare claim that presentism is\nintuitive (etc.) and that this gives us reason to think that\nit\u2019s true.\n\nOne way to proceed is to extend this idea. Begin with the intuition\nthat there\u2019s something special about the\npresent\u2014something distinctive. This seems attractive enough. But\nhow might we capture it in our metaphysical model of time? One way to\ndo it is to assert that present things are the only things that exist,\nthat is, to endorse the presentist\u2019s ontic thesis. Certainly,\nthis marks the present as distinctive. And, to the extent that we wish\nto capture and preserve the idea that the present is\n\u201cspecial\u201d (in some sense), presentism fares well against\nthis measure. But, of course, any model that privileges the\npresent in some way or other will fare well against the same measure\n(such as the growing block theory, which states that the present is\nspecial in virtue of being the latest moment of existence). So, for\nthis argument to motivate presentism fully, further argument must be\ngiven for thinking that rival views don\u2019t come up to\nscratch.\n\nAnother way to motivate presentism is via appeal to experience. To\nborrow a famous example, consider a headache (e.g., Zimmerman 1998:\n212). If a headache exists, it hurts. It can\u2019t exist and fail to\nhurt. Now, suppose that we endorse the existence of the past (and deny\npresentism). Past headaches exist. But they don\u2019t hurt (at\nleast, so goes the claim). If headaches from hangovers last year hurt\nus, neither author would be in a position to write this, so severe\nwould be the pain. Since headaches must hurt, if they\nexist\u2014it\u2019s part of their essence to do so\u2014past\nheadaches cannot exist. This goes for the future headaches as well.\nThus, presentism is true. (For the classic statement of the\n\u201cthank goodness that\u2019s over\u201d argument, in favor of A\ntheories of time, see A.N. Prior 1959. The wider literature is\nvoluminous. Representative recent works include: Suhler &\nCallender 2012; Hoerl 2015; Pearson 2018.)\n\nThere are different examples that draw upon our experience of pain and\nour attitude towards it. Consider again a past headache and compare it\nto a (possible) future headache, something that may result from\noverenthusiastic behavior in the bar this evening. A future headache\nis something that worries us. It influences our behavior. We seek to\navoid it. We may even fear it. By contrast, we feel differently about\npast headaches (and past pains, generally). We don\u2019t fear past\npains. They don\u2019t worry us in quite the same way. One\nexplanation for this is that a past pain doesn\u2019t exist. Whilst a\nfuture pain doesn\u2019t exist either, we know that it will exist if\nwe behave in such-and-such a way. It\u2019s the potential for that\nheadache to exist (to come into being) that causes us to modify our\nbehavior. We wish to avoid that state. But if we think that past and\nfuture things exist, we cannot appeal to the explanation just given,\nfor if the past headache exists, presumably we should fear it or worry\nabout it, just as we should if a future headache exists. (For a brief,\ngeneral discussion of connections between time and rationality, see\nthe entry on\n time:\n \u00a712. For further reading on \u2018time biases\u2019 \u2014\nsuch as \u2018future bias\u2019, where an agent prefers that bad or\npainful experiences be in the past and that good or pleasurable\nexperiences be in the future \u2014 see, e.g., Hare 2007, 2013;\nSullivan 2017, 2018; Bnefsi 2020; Fernandes 2021.)\n\nLast, but not least, we might motivate presentism by appealing to\nontological parsimony (e.g., Bourne 2006: 68\u201369). Suppose that\nwe endorse something like \u201cOckham\u2019s razor\u201d,\nviz. the principle that one shouldn\u2019t multiply entities\nbeyond necessity (see the entry on\n  simplicity>,\n esp. \u00a72). By asserting that only present things exist, i.e., by\nnot positing the existence of any non-present things, the\npresentist\u2019s ontology is more parsimonious than the ontology of\ntheir opponents (e.g., growing block theorists posit the existence of\npast and present things, eternalists posit the existence of past,\npresent, and future things, etc.). All things being equal, we have at\nleast a defeasible preference for presentism over its rivals, if we\nhave a taste for ontological desert landscapes.\n\nThere are a number of complications with this way of motivating\npresentism. For one thing, although it\u2019s typical (in\nmetaphysics) to see appeals to ontological parsimony in cases where\none view is more \u201cqualitatively\u201d parsimonious\nthan its rivals, that is, cases where a view posits fewer\nkinds of thing than opposing views, it\u2019s far less\ntypical to see appeals in cases where one view is merely more\n\u201cquantitatively\u201d parsimonious than rivals, that\nis, cases where a view posits fewer things than another. The fact that\nappeals to quantitative parsimony are less typical reflects a general\nattitude that the only ontological parsimony that one ought to respect\nis qualitative parsimony. As David Lewis famously puts it:\n\n\nI subscribe to the general view that qualitative parsimony is good in\na philosophical or empirical hypothesis; but I recognize no\npresumption whatever in favor of quantitative parsimony (1973: 87)\n\n\nNow, it seems that if presentism is to be motivated by appeal to\nparsimony, then it must be motivated by appeal to considerations of\nquantitative parsimony. Presentism and eternalism don\u2019t\ndisagree about the kinds of things that exist. Both\npresentists and non-presentists tend to agree on the metaphysical\nkinds (or \u201contological categories\u201d) that exist. What they\ndisagree about is the temporal location of the things that exist.\nPresentism states that everything exists at the present time;\neternalism states that there are things that exist at other times. If\npresentism is to be motivated in this way, then we must justify a\npreference for quantitative parsimony in this case in the face of the\northodoxy that Lewis expresses. (See Tallant 2013 for an attempt to\ndeliver this sort of argument for presentism. For arguments that\njustify quantitative parsimony as a theoretical virtue, more\ngenerally, see Nolan 1997; Baker 2003; Jansson & Tallant\n2017.)\n\nAt the outset, we noted that presentism has been formulated,\ndeveloped, and modified in response to a range of objections. In what\nremains of this entry, we consider what we take to be the most\nprominent and well-developed of these objections and explain how\npresentists have tried to respond (\u00a7\u00a73\u20138).\n3. Definitional Concerns\n\nConsider the following minimal statement of presentism, viz.\nthe ontological thesis, P:\n\n(P)\nOnly present things exist.\n\n\nThere is a concern with P, understood as a statement\nof presentism, arguing that the use of the verb \u201cexist\u201d is\nambiguous in a problematic way. The idea is that, once\nP is disambiguated properly, presentism is either\ntrivially true (but consistent with some non-presentist views) or else\nfalse. P admits of three apparently distinct\nreadings:\n\n(P1)\nOnly present things exist now.\n(P2)\nOnly present things have existed, exist now, or will\nexist.\n(P3)\nOnly present things exist\nsimpliciter.\n\n\nThe highlighted portions indicate a putative disambiguation of\n\u201cexist\u201d. Opponents insist that these are the only\navailable readings of P and press the following\nargument:\n\n(1) Presentism is\nP1, P2, or\nP3.\n(2) The claim\n\u201conly present things exist now\u201d\n(P1) is trivial.\n(3) The claim\n\u201conly present things have existed, exist now, or will\nexist\u201d (P2) is false\n(4) The claim\n\u201conly present things exist simpliciter\u201d\n(P3) is false.\n(5) Therefore,\npresentism is either trivial or false.\n\n\nFor statements of this argument, see Crisp (2004: 17) and Ludlow\n(2004: 22). For discussion of the (so-called) \u201csceptical\u201d\nchallenge, in a variety of forms, see Merricks (1995: 523, 1999:\n421\u20132), Zimmerman (1998: 209\u201310), Lombard (1999:\n254\u20135, 2010), Sider (1999: 325\u20137, 2006), Callender (2000:\nS588\u201390), Rea (2003), Meyer (2005, 2013), Savitt (2006),\nStoneham (2009), Mozersky (2011: 122\u20135), Torrengo (2012, 2016),\nMiller (2013: 348\u201351), Tallant (2014), Deng (2018), and Deasy\n(2019b), amongst others.\n\nThe argument (1)\u2013(5) is valid. But why think that it\u2019s\nsound? Well, premise (2) is clearly true. The claim that \u201conly\npresent things exist now\u201d amounts to the claim that \u201conly\npresently existing things presently exist\u201d. Whilst we\nshouldn\u2019t disagree with this claim, it\u2019s a mere triviality\nand cannot be used to advance a distinctive position in the philosophy\nof time. Moreover, P1 is consistent with\nthe existence of non-present things, contrary to the spirit of\npresentism. For example, Marie Curie isn\u2019t a present\nentity\u2014she doesn\u2019t exist now\u2014but she can exist (in\nthe past) without contradicting P1. Hence,\nP1 isn\u2019t an adequate statement of\npresentism, regardless of its status as a truism.\n\nWhat about premises (3) and (4)? The standard justification for (3) is\nthat P2 is false because it\u2019s open\nto counterexamples. The standard justification for (4) is that\nP3 collapses into\nP2. Both are controversial. We take each\nin turn.\n3.1 Counterexamples to P2\n\nThe claim that we explore here is that: \u201conly present things\nhave existed, exist now, or will exist\u201d\n(P2) is false because some non-present\nthings have existed. For example, Marie Curie isn\u2019t a present\nthing, but she has existed. This appears to be a counterexample to\nP2.\n\nOne might reply here that P2 isn\u2019t\nfalse (for the reason just given) because there are no\nnon-present entities\u2014presentists don\u2019t think that there\nis something, Curie, that exists and isn\u2019t present. To\nwork through the details here, it\u2019s important to start talking\nabout what presentists accept in the domain of their most unrestricted\nquantifiers. That is, P2 isn\u2019t false\nbecause there are no non-present entities in the relevant domain of\nquantification. Suppose that we read P2 in\nthe following way: \u201cfor any x, if x has\nexisted, exists now, or will exist, then x is present\u201d.\nAnd, following Thomas Crisp (2004), presentists may read the\nquantifier \u201cfor any\u2026\u201d as \u201cfor any\u2026\nwithin time\u201d (depending on views about the existence of timeless\nentities). If we shift to this reading, it\u2019s no longer obvious\nthat P2 is false. It\u2019s true that\nthere once was an entity, Marie Curie, who doesn\u2019t exist at all\nanymore. But it\u2019s not clear that Curie must be within the\nrelevant domain of quantification simply in virtue of having once\nexisted. So, if we read P2 as \u201cfor\nany x (within time), if x has existed, exists now,\nor will exist, then x is present\u201d\u2014and we deny\nthat there are any non-present entities\u2014then\nP2 isn\u2019t false (Crisp 2004:\n18\u201320). And, if P2 isn\u2019t\nfalse, then premise (3) is false, and the argument is\nunsound.\n\nOf course, whether one thinks that this kind of strategy is successful\nwill likely depend upon how one understands the locution \u201cfor\nany x\u201d. Not everyone will be persuaded. For instance,\nUlrich Meyer (2005: 214, 2013: 68\u201369), when advancing his own\n\u201csceptical\u201d challenge to presentism, considers a statement\nof presentism that\u2019s very similar to the reading of\nP2 offered by Crisp (2004), in which the\nstatement of presentism is equivalent to the claim that \u201conly\npresent entities exist temporally\u201d. (On the assumption that\n\u201cx exists within time\u201d and \u201cx\nexists temporally\u201d are the very same notion, the two statements\nare equivalent.) However, Meyer argues that it\u2019s clear enough\nthat Curie exists temporally. After all, she has existed! And what can\n\u201cx exists temporally\u201d (or \u201cx\nexists\u201d) mean if not, simply, \u201cx has existed,\nexists now, or will exist\u201d?\n3.2 The Collapse of P3\n\nAssuming that the likes of Meyer are correct (and that the likes of\nCrisp are not), what should we make of premise (4)? What should we\nmake of the claim that: \u201conly present entities exist\nsimpliciter\u201d (P3) is false\nbecause P3 collapses into\nP2 (and P2 is\nfalse)? Perhaps we can argue that P3\ndoesn\u2019t collapse into P2, and that\nP3 represents a distinct way to state the\npresentist\u2019s ontic thesis. A defender of\nP3 might argue that there\u2019s a notion\nof \u201cexistence simpliciter\u201d that\u2019s\nintelligible, substantive and, importantly, distinct from the\n\u201ctensed\u201d (\u201ctemporal\u201d) notion of existence\nthat\u2019s captured in P2 (i.e.,\n\u201chas existed, exists now, or will exist\u201d).\n\nOnce again, there\u2019s clear and sustained disagreement about the\neffectiveness of this strategy. Suppose that we can insist sensibly\nthat there\u2019s a notion of \u201cexistence\nsimpliciter\u201d that helps presentism to avoid the\nchallenge that P3 collapses into\nP2. (If this is so, then our opponent\ncan\u2019t tell us, simply, that P3 is\nfalse if P2 is false.) Nevertheless, this\nraises the question as to what, precisely, is meant by\n\u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d and whether the\nnew notion can be used to characterize presentism.\n\nWhat does \u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d mean?\nIn this context, Meyer (2005: 214\u20135) tells us that if x\nexists simpliciter, then x exists either in the\nactual world, @, or else in some merely possible world. And, if\nx exists in @, then it exists in time, it exists\ntemporally; x either has existed, exists now, or\nwill exist. Thus, it seems that if we specify the meaning of\n\u201cx exists simpliciter\u201d, we must take it\nto mean either that x exists \u201coutside time\u201d, but\nsomehow still in @, or else at some other world. But, perhaps\ncontroversially, Meyer (2005: 215) argues that neither of these ways\nof specifying the notion of \u201cexistence\nsimpliciter\u201d will give us a characterization of\npresentism, qua model of time. Presentism is a view about\nwhat exists in time; it\u2019s not a thesis about what exists outside\nof time, nor is it a thesis about what exists at other possible\nworlds. (Recall, from the discussion of the implications of\nPA, above, that nothing exists outside time, for\npresentists; nothing exists that isn\u2019t present. Hence,\npresentism concerns what exists within time since it implies\nthat nothing exists without.)\n\nIt\u2019s only fair to conclude this part of the discussion by noting\nthat it\u2019s unclear how far we should be moved by these\nconsiderations. For instance, Daniel Deasy (2017) is clear that he\nthinks very little of this objection. Deasy discusses the objection\n(to presentism, defined as \u201calways, everything is\npresent\u201d), somewhat witheringly, as follows:\n\n\n[Some argue along the following lines:] the quantifier in the\ntraditional definition is either tensed or tenseless. If it is tensed\nthen presentism is the obviously false thesis that always, everything\nis now present. If it is tenseless then presentism is the trivially\ntrue thesis that always, everything is, was, or will be present.\n\u2026 The problem with this argument is that the key\npremise\u2014that the quantifier in the traditional definition is\neither tensed or tenseless\u2014is false. The universal quantifier in\nthe traditional definition (\u201ceverything\u201d) should be read\nas expressing exactly the universal quantifier of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic \u2026 [The] traditional definition is\nintended to express a metaphysical thesis, and metaphysical theses\nought to be expressed in the most metaphysically\nperspicuous\u2014i.e., most \u201cjoint carving\u201d\u2014terms\npossible. Classical first-order predicate logic is a much better\ncandidate for a language whose terms so cut than a natural language\nlike English. Moreover, the standard quantifiers of classical\nfirst-order predicate logic are neither \u201ctensed\u201d nor\n\u201ctenseless\u201d (or at least, not in the sense of the above\nargument). \u2026 [Quantifiers] are not verbs, they are quantifiers\n\u2026 Therefore there is no good reason to think the quantifiers\nhave either reading. (2017: 380\u20131)\n\n\nHowever, presentists shouldn\u2019t celebrate too early. They should\nremain cautious. Deasy goes on to raise an independent concern with\nhow to define presentism. Echoing a challenge from Timothy Williamson\n(2013: 24\u201325), Deasy objects that there\u2019s no satisfactory\nway to spell out what\u2019s meant by \u201cis present\u201d in the\ndefinition of presentism. Further, we may also need to say something\nabout the duration of the present (see Gentry 2021).\n3.3 Existence Presentism\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, standard ways of characterizing presentism face\ndefinitional worries. So, let\u2019s change tack for a moment.\nTypically, presentism is presented as the view that only present\nthings exist. But it might seem natural to suppose that there\u2019s\nmore to presentism than a claim about the extent of our ontological\ncommitments. That is, presentism shouldn\u2019t just be seen as a\nlist of which objects exist (the present ones), but a claim about\nexistence itself. For instance, Dean Zimmerman (1996) characterizes\npresentism as the view that \u201cto be present just is to\nbe real or to exist\u201d (1996: 117). When presentism is\ncharacterized in this way, we can label it \u201cExistence\nPresentism\u201d, following Jonathan Tallant (2014).\n\nTrenton Merricks gives a more thorough expression of this picture, as\nfollows:\n\n\n[Standard] definitions, even though they get at something important,\nfail to get at what separates presentism most fundamentally from\neternalism. \u2026 [Presentism] and eternalism differ most\nfundamentally with respect to the nature of time and, relatedly, with\nrespect to what it is to exist at a time (and to have properties at a\ntime). (2007: 119\u201320)\n\nPresentists and eternalists alike say that those things that exist at\nthe present time really do exist and, moreover, that properties had at\nthe present time really are had. Thus one might think that, while\npresentism and eternalism part ways with respect to other times, they\nagree about the nature of the present time and, relatedly, agree about\nwhat it is to exist (and have properties) at the present time. But\nthey do not agree about these things. Indeed, their differences with\nrespect to the nature of, and existence at, the present time are as\nimportant as their differences with respect to the past and the\nfuture. (2007: 123)\n\n[Presentists] insist that there are objects that exist at the\npresent time (or, equivalently, that presently exist).\nSince they do not believe in a region called the \u201cpresent\ntime\u201d, presentists cannot reduce existing at the present\ntime to being located at that region. I think presentists should,\ninstead, say that existing at the present time just is\nexisting. Thus, given presentism, if something exists, then,\nobviously enough, it exists at the present time. So, given presentism,\nsince everything exists, everything exists at the present time. (2007:\n125)\n\n\nThis way of characterizing presentism challenges the orthodoxy\n(sketched in\n \u00a71),\n which takes the main difference between presentism and eternalism\n(etc.) to be their distinct ontological commitments. On this revised\nway of thinking, such ontological disagreements are a consequence of\nthe view, rather than what\u2019s truly distinctive about it.\nInstead, what\u2019s crucial to presentism is a claim about the\nnature of existence. To exist is to be present.\n\nHow, if at all, does this way of thinking about presentism help with\nthe definitional worries? This move might help us to identify a new\nkind of disagreement between presentists and non-presentists.\nPresentists can endorse an identity claim, \u201cexisting at the\npresent time is existing\u201d and, thus, draw new battlelines. This\nidentity claim is present-tensed and true now; it\ndoesn\u2019t face the same worries as the other statements of\npresentism (P1,\nP2, or P3).\nNonetheless, the claim is distinctive; it\u2019s not something to\nwhich eternalists can assent. Eternalists don\u2019t agree that\nexisting now is existing.c\n3.4 Transientism and Permanentism\n\nA different sort of response to definitional worries is to recast the\ndebate between presentists and non-presentists as a debate concerning\ntwo distinct, opposing theses: transientism and\npermanentism. Whereas presentism and eternalism are views\nabout what exists, transientism and permanentism are views about\nwhether things begin or cease to exist. Transientism is the view that:\nsometimes, something begins to exist and, sometimes, something ceases\nto exist; permanentism is the view that: always, everything always\nexists (Deasy 2015, 2017, 2019a; Cameron 2016; cf. Sullivan 2012).\n\nOne suggestion is that, if we accept that the traditional\npresentism-eternalism debate is flawed because of definitional\nworries, then the traditional debate should \u201cgive way\u201d to\nthe new transientism-permanentism debate (e.g., Williamson 2013: 25;\nDeasy 2019a: 284). A related suggestion is that, since mainstream\ncharacterisations of presentism, eternalism, etc., should be rejected\n(again, because of definitional worries), we should accept new\ncharacterisations of these views, given in terms of transientism or\npermanentism (e.g., Deasy 2017). On this approach, we might\ncharacterise presentism as the conjunction of transientism and a\nminimal conception of the A theory, i.e., that there is an absolute,\nobjective present moment (see Deasy 2017: 391; cf. Correia &\nRosenkranz 2015, 2020; Viebahn 2020).\n4. Cross-Temporal Relations\n\nPrima facie, there are myriad \u201ccross-temporal\u201d\nrelations. We admire Marie Curie; admiration is a\nrelation. Yesterday\u2019s rain caused today\u2019s flood; causation\nis a relation. There are other kinds of relation, which we discuss\nbelow, such as directly referring and truth-making, which seem like\nthey cross times (and as if they might cause special trouble for\npresentism). For now though we want to consider the point very\ngenerally. Presentism is not compatible with the existence of Marie\nCurie or yesterday\u2019s rainfall; presentism denies the existence\nof all past entities. Nonetheless, what we have here with admiration\nand causation seems to be a relation. It\u2019s very natural and very\nreasonable to suppose that a relation can only be instantiated if all\nof its relata exist: x cannot stand in a relation R\nto y unless both x and y exist. If that\u2019s\nright, then there\u2019s an obvious worry. Presentism seems flat out\nincompatible with the existence of any and all cross-temporal\nrelations. Something must give.\n\nA famous statement of this \u201cargument from relations\u201d is\ndue to John Bigelow (1996). It goes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026in order for a relation to hold between two things, both of\nthose two things will have to exist. Call this the principle that all\nrelations are existence entailing. Add as a further premise the\nsupposition that relations sometimes hold between a present thing and\nsomething else which is not present. The conclusion follows\nineluctably, that some things exist which are not present. (1996:\n37)\n\n\nBigelow suggests that this argument goes as far back as the Stoics and\nEpicureans. Here we focus on contemporary iterations of the problem.\nFor recent discussion of the problem, in a variety of forms, see Adams\n(1986: 321\u20138), Quine (1987: 197\u20138), Chisholm (1990a,b),\nBigelow (1996), Sider (1999, 2001: 25\u201335), Craig (2000:\n211\u20132), Davidson (2003), Markosian (2004), Crisp (2005),\nBrogaard (2006, 2013), De Clercq (2006), Torrengo (2006, 2010), Inman\n(2012), Ciuni & Torrengo (2013), and Ingthorsson (2019). For a\nsubstantial, book-length treatment of the issue, see Torrengo\n(2008).\n\nQuite generally, presentism can be defended via one of a few\nstrategies to address this worry about \u201ccross-time\u201d\nrelations. One option: to use presently existing entities to make\nsense of the relational claims. With our admiration of Marie Curie,\nfor example, this amounts to saying that: when she existed, Curie\ninstantiated various features and properties, those properties still\nexist, and it\u2019s those present properties that we\u2019re\nrelated to in admiration. Thus, it\u2019s not Curie herself that we\nadmire, but her perseverance, insight and brilliance. Of course, one\nimportant issue with this strategy is that it fails to respect the\nidea that it\u2019s Curie herself that we admire, rather than mere\nproperties that she exemplified. Alternatively, then, alongside\ndefending presentism we might deny that some or all relations are\n\u201cexistence-entailing\u201d. Thus, we can stand in the relation\nof admiration to Marie Curie herself, even though there\u2019s no\nsuch entity as Curie. But here we would face the difficult task of\ndenying the natural and reasonable supposition that a relation can\nonly be instantiated if all of its relata exist. Presentists who go\nthis route deny \u201cserious presentism\u201d and start down the\nroad towards Meinongianism, a position which many find quite\nundesirable (see the entry on\n nonexistent objects,\n esp. \u00a74). Serious presentism is the temporal analogue of\n\u201cserious actualism\u201d, the view that \u201cnecessarily, if\nx has F or bears R, then x\nexists\u201d (see the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate,\n esp. \u00a74.1). (We remain neutral on the question of whether\npresentism implies serious presentism, pace Bergmann 1999,\nDavidson 2000, and leave the \u201cnon-serious\u201d option open to\npresentists.) There\u2019s at least one more option open: to say that\nsuch seeming cases of relations aren\u2019t, in fact, relational at\nall. Thus, rather than our admiration of Curie being a state that\nconsists in Curie existing, our existing, and our bearing a relation\nto Curie, all that there is to such a state is our existing and\ninstantiating a monadic property, admiring Marie Curie. Since\nthe property is monadic, its instantiation requires only our\nexistence.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are questions about the advisability of each\nstrategy, in general, as well as about whether each can be pursued or\napplied sensibly in defense of presentism. Nonetheless, with the above\ngeneral overview in hand, we now turn our attention to two\nphilosophical problems that confront presentism: the problem of\nreference to non-present entities (\u00a75) and the\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d problem (\u00a76). Both are specific\ninstances of our main objection, introduced above, and both present\nspecial problems for presentists. (The well-informed reader will note\nthat we haven\u2019t yet mentioned explicitly problems concerning\nquantification across times or metric tensed statements. We consider\nboth as part of\n \u00a76.)\n5. Reference and Propositions\n\nNote that Socrates was a wise, snub-nosed philosopher, who happened to\nbe Plato\u2019s finest teacher. From this story, we can infer that\n\u201cSocrates was wise\u201d is true and, we might reasonably\nsuppose, it expresses a (true) proposition, <Socrates was wise>.\nSimilarly, we can take it that \u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise\u201d is also true and it expresses a (true) proposition,\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise>. [See the entry\non\n propositions.]\n\nSome preliminary observations. Both propositions exist; they are true\nand so they must exist in order to be true. (Assuming something like\n\u201cserious actualism\u201d, see above.) Equally, both\npropositions are about the very same individual, Socrates, though\nthere\u2019s a sense in which <Socrates was wise> is about\nSocrates more thoroughly (more intimately) than <Plato\u2019s\nfinest teacher was wise> is about him. Indeed, it seems that\n<Socrates was wise> is \u201cdirectly\u201d about Socrates,\nwhereas <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is only\n\u201cindirectly\u201d about him. <Socrates was wise> cannot\nfail to be about Socrates; it determines Socrates, the same\nindividual, in all possible contexts. But, by contrast,\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is about Socrates only\naccidentally, only in virtue of the contingent fact that Socrates was\nPlato\u2019s finest teacher.\n\nFurther, note that the sentence \u201cSocrates was wise\u201d, which\nexpresses <Socrates was wise>, contains a proper name\n(\u201cSocrates\u201d). And, suppose that this directly refers to\nSocrates. By contrast, \u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise\u201d, which expresses <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise>, contains a description (\u201cPlato\u2019s finest\nteacher\u201d). We might suppose that this doesn\u2019t directly\nrefer to Socrates, nor does it determine him in all possible contexts.\nConsider, for example, the possible scenario in which Socrates never\nencountered Plato. In this context, Plato\u2019s finest teacher would\nhave been a distinct individual and the corresponding description\n\u201cPlato\u2019s finest teacher\u201d would pick out that\nindividual. As such, <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise>\nwould not be about Socrates and the truth of the proposition\nwouldn\u2019t depend upon any facts about him. What unites both cases\nis reference; what divides them is the direct or indirect character of\nhow the expressions refer. Typically, reference is construed as a\nrelation that obtains between language and reality (between linguistic\nitems and things in the world). [See the entry on\n reference.]\n And, again: for two things to be so related, both things (both\nrelata) must exist.\n\nIn defending presentism, we face a problem of direct reference with\nrespect to merely past entities. (Although, on one reading, it\u2019s\nmerely an instance of the problem of \u201ccross-time\nrelations\u201d introduced in\n \u00a74.)\n It seems that we can and do refer successfully to entities that have\nexisted and exist no longer, entities that don\u2019t exist at all,\ngiven presentism. But, if this is so, then the past entities that we\nrefer to (and which are related to our linguistic items) must exist,\ncontrary to presentism. Presentists face a difficult choice. That is,\nthey must reject one of the following four claims, which form an\napparently inconsistent set: (i) we successfully refer to merely past\nentities, (ii) reference is a relation, (iii) for a relation to\nobtain, the relata must exist, and (iv) there are no merely past\nentities (i.e., past entities don\u2019t exist). Presentists\ncan\u2019t deny (iv), since that amounts to a rejection of\npresentism. But it proves almost equally difficult to reject any of\nthe other claims, given their independent plausibility.\n5.1 Singular Propositions\n\nLet\u2019s move away from the issue of reference and turn to the\nmetaphysics of propositions. First, note that <Socrates was\nwise> is a \u201csingular\u201d proposition: a proposition\nthat\u2019s directly about some individual, Socrates, whereas\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is a\n\u201cparticularised\u201d proposition: a proposition that\u2019s\nabout Socrates, but not directly about them. [See the entry on\n singular propositions.]\n Frequently, propositions are taken to be complex metaphysical\nentities, entities with constituents and structure. [See the entry on\n structured propositions.]\n On this way of thinking, singular propositions are understood\ntypically as constituted by individuals, specifically the individuals\nthat they are (directly) about. Hence, a singular proposition about\nsome, x, is constituted by x itself. By contrast,\nparticularised propositions aren\u2019t constituted by individuals,\nalthough they are structured entities with constituents. A\nparticularised proposition about x isn\u2019t constituted by\nx, but may be constituted by a property of x. On\nthis view, <Socrates was wise>, for example, is constituted by\nSocrates himself, whereas <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise> isn\u2019t constituted by Socrates\u2014but, perhaps, the\nproposition is constituted by some actual accidental property of\nSocrates, being the finest teacher of Plato or, indeed,\nhaving been the finest teacher of Plato. This way of thinking\nabout (singular) propositions isn\u2019t universal, but it\u2019s\npart of a standard theory with many adherents (see Adams 1986;\nWilliamson 2002; King 2007). In what follows, we refer to this view as\nthe \u2018neo-Russellian\u2019 view of propositions.\n\nIf propositions are complex (structured) entities with constituents,\nthen they depend for their existence upon the existence of their\npropositional constituents. The way that such entities ontologically\ndepend upon constituents is analogous to the way that sets depend upon\ntheir members. Consider, for example, {x}, x\u2019s\nsingleton set. {x} depends upon x for its existence.\nTypically, this is cashed out as follows: necessarily, {x}\nexists only if x exists; and, it\u2019s not the case that\nx exists only if {x} exists. Similarly, we say:\nnecessarily, some proposition P exists only if its\n(propositional) constituent c exist; and, it\u2019s not the\ncase that c exists only if P exists. [See the entry\non\n ontological dependence.]\n\nPresentism faces a problem about how to account for the existence of\nsingular propositions about past entities. It seems that there are\nsuch propositions; recall that \u201cSocrates was wise\u201d\nexpresses a true singular proposition, <Socrates was wise>,\nwhich must exist in order to be true. The problem arises given the\nfollowing treatment of singular propositions: a proposition\nthat\u2019s directly about an individual x is constituted by\nx itself, and propositions depend for their existence upon\nthe existence of their constituents. So, for example, <Socrates was\nwise> is constituted by Socrates himself and this proposition\nontologically depends upon Socrates.\n\nHere\u2019s a deductively valid argument against presentism, based on\nthe above considerations:\n\n(1) If a proposition is\ntrue, then it exists.\n(2) <Socrates was\nwise> is true.\n(3) <Socrates was\nwise> exists. (1, 2)\n(4) If a proposition\nexists and has constituents, then its constituents exist.\n(5) Socrates is a\nconstituent of <Socrates was wise>.\n(6) Socrates exists.\n(3, 4, 5)\n(7) If Socrates exists,\nthen presentism is false.\n(8) Presentism is\nfalse. (6, 7)\n\n\nThe argument is clearly valid. To defend presentism, we must deny one\nof the premises. But each premise appears independently plausible. (1)\ntakes truth to be a monadic property, e.g., being true, and\nreflects a commitment to serious actualism: if P instantiates\nbeing true, then P exists. (2) takes propositions as\ntruth-bearers (or \u201ctruth-value bearers\u201d) and follows from\nthe simple claim that there are truths about the past (more on this in\n \u00a76).\n (4) takes propositions as complex entities and reflects a commitment\nto the principle that a complex depends for its existence upon things\nthat constitute it. The remaining premises, (5) and (7), follow\nstraightforwardly from the two metaphysical theses at issue, the\nneo-Russellian view of propositions and presentism, respectively.\n\nThe most obvious line of response (if we wish to avoid rejecting too\nmany plausible premises) is to deny some aspect of the\nneo-Russellian\u00a0view of propositions. Here we see at least two\nsorts of reply: some suggest\u00a0a modification of the view (e.g.,\nIngram 2019: 85\u2013104), others suggest\u00a0a total rejection of\nit (e.g., Merricks 2012, 2015: 157\u201390). If we take\u00a0the way\nof modification,\u00a0we can accept that propositions are structured\nentities with constituents, but urge that the propositional\nconstituents are presently existing entities, and not any non-existent\npast entities. If we take the way of rejection, we can deny that\npropositions are structured entities and, instead, suggest a distinct\ntreatment of propositions.\n\nFor another line of response, presentism might be modified\n\u00e0 la Williamson (1998, 2002), who defends a view\naccording to which past objects still exist, but are no longer\nconcrete. We don\u2019t take a stand on whether such a position\ndeserves the epithet \u201cpresentism\u201d and, further, we note\nthat Williamson (2013: 20) explicitly states that he would prefer to\nsee the presentism-eternalist debate recast in other terms, using a\ndifferent methodology (see \u00a73.4). Nonetheless, it is clear enough\nthat if the existence of abstract-Socrates (who once was concrete but\nnow is abstract) is compatible with presentism, then this would give\nthe presentist a means to deny (7) and reject the argument given\nabove.\n\nFor discussion of the above problem, in a variety of forms (i.e.,\nconcerning direct reference or singular propositions), see Adams\n(1986: 315\u201322), Fitch (1994), Markosian (2004), Merricks (2012:\n64\u201367, 2015: 170\u20133), and Ingram (2016). There\u2019s a\nmodal analogue of this problem, facing actualism (roughly, the view\nthat \u201conly actual things exist\u201d), and a rich literature\naccompanying it. For discussion of this problem, see Adams (1981),\nPlantinga (1983), Barcan Marcus (1985), Fine (1985), Davidson (2000),\nMerricks (2012: 64\u201371, 2015: 173\u201380), and Speaks\n(2012).\n6. Truth and Truth-Making\n\nA good deal of work on presentism in the philosophy of time concerns\nitself with truth. In the current context, the work in question\nfocuses on whether (and, if so, how) presentism can account for the\ndifferent kinds of true proposition that we endorse. Our primary focus\nwill be on how to defend presentism whilst giving appropriate\nontological explanations for the truth of true claims about past\nthings (with the \u201ctruth-making\u201d literature as the\nbackground). We also briefly address a related problem of truths about\nspans of time, which is sometimes treated as a separate issue\nconcerning quantification over times.\n\nWe turn to one of the most discussed challenges to presentism in the\ncontemporary debate: the truth-maker objection to presentism. At first\npass, this objection is another instance of the general problem of\ncross-temporal relations\n (\u00a74),\n but there are reasons for thinking that concerns about truth-makers\nunderwrite a special problem for presentists. This objection is\ntreated as a significant problem for presentism by many, including but\nnot limited to: Sider (2001: 35\u201342), Armstrong (2004:\n145\u201350), Keller (2004), Crisp (2007), Cameron (2011), Sanson\n& Caplan (2010), Markosian (2013), Tallant & Ingram (2015),\nand Emery (2020). For one general discussion of the problem, see\nCaplan & Sanson (2011). [See the entry on\n truthmakers\n for background.]\n\nThe truth-maker objection is presented as a tension between three\nindependently plausible principles: (i) presentism, (ii) that there\nare (evidence-transcendent and objective) truths about the past, and\n(iii) truth-maker theory, the view that truths about the past are\n\u201cmade true\u201d by some existent (see, e.g., Keller\n2004: 85\u201387; Cameron 2011: 55\u201357; Tallant & Ingram\n2015: 355, for this mode of presentation). Obviously, we cannot defend\npresentism and abandon (i). Further, rejecting (ii) seems a steep\nprice to pay (cf. Dawson 2021; Miller forthcoming). If there are no\ntruths about the past, then it\u2019s hard to make sense of the idea\nthat things change from moment to moment (or that time passes; see\n \u00a77).\n That leaves us with (iii). Here, three options present themselves:\nlocate the required truth-makers, deny that truths about the past\nrequire truth-makers, or argue that truth-making isn\u2019t the kind\nof relation that requires the existence of both relata. We consider\nthese options in turn.\n\nNote that a version of this problem can be stated with the principle\nthat \u201ctruth supervenes upon being\u201d in place of truth-maker\ntheory (as in Kierland & Monton 2007). It\u2019s far more common\nto raise this objection as a problem about a lack of truth-makers\n(rather than the lack of an appropriate \u201csubvenient\nbase\u201d). Hence, we focus on the truth-maker objection.\n6.1 Locate the Truth-Makers\n\nTruth-makers for truths about the past aren\u2019t easy to find. We\nare searching for entities \u201cin virtue of\u201d which\npropositions about the past are true. For example, <Curie\nexisted> is true in virtue of some entity, its\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d. But what plays the truth-making role?\nSchematically, two kinds of solution can be given here: (i) posit\npresently existing truth-makers, or (ii) posit truth-makers that exist\n\u201coutside time\u201d. Option (ii) is open to presentists who\ncountenance the existence of some atemporal entities (e.g.,\npropositions, numbers, etc.), though such a version of presentism\nwould require a defense of the idea that entities that exist\noutside of time do no violence to the claim that \u201conly\npresent things exist\u201d\n (\u00a71).\n\nPresentism can be amended via the addition of atemporal\ntruth-makers\u2014truth-making entities that are, in a sense,\n\u201coutside\u201d time (see Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007). This is\n\u201cersatz presentism\u201d. Ersatz presentists claim that, e.g.,\n<Curie existed> is \u201cmade true\u201d by an abstract time\nthat represents how things were when Curie existed. (This is an\n\u201cersatz\u201d time, rather than a \u201cgenuine\u201d\nconcrete time.) One way to understand ersatz presentism is as the view\nthat there\u2019s an abstract four-dimensional manifold of times that\nrepresents how things were, are now, and will be. This manifold is\nordered by an ersatz B-theoretic \u201cearlier than\u201d relation\nand forms an ersatz B series of times. The truth-makers for truths\nabout the past are abstracta: the ersatz times. An ersatz time,\nT, represents how things were (at some past time) by\nsome other ersatz time, T*, accurately representing how the\nconcrete world is now, and by T bearing the\n\u201cearlier than\u201d relation (the \u201cersatz\nB-relation\u201d) to T*.\n\nErsatz presentism is popular, but option (i)\u2014positing present\ntruth-makers\u2014includes more variation. The most well-known\nversion of this view is \u201cLucretianism\u201d espoused by John\nBigelow (1996). Lucretians claim that <Curie existed> is made\ntrue by the world now instantiating a primitive past-tensed property\n(a \u201cLucretian\u201d property) of having contained Marie Curie.\nThe presently existing truth-maker is the present instantiation of the\nLucretian property (having contained Curie) by the world.\nThere are a range of other \u201cproperty solutions\u201d, alongside\nLucretianism, which differ in important respects, but which share a\ncommon core. For instance: see Keller (2004: 94\u2013101) on a range\nof solutions, including one with indestructible atoms and their\nproperties, Cameron (2011, 2013) on temporal distributional\nproperties, McKinnon & Bigelow (2012) on tensing the instantiation\ntie, and Ingram (2018) on uninstantiated thisnesses, amongst\nothers.\n\nResponses to positions that posit present truth-makers (i.e.,\nBigelow\u2019s Lucretianism and \u201cBigelow-style\u201d property\nsolutions, mentioned briefly) are that each suffers from three\nproblems, perhaps only one of which afflicts the ersatzer\u2019s\nproposal. The problems facing presentism supplemented with these\ntruth-makers are as follows.\n\nFirst, note that any solution must ensure that the truth-makers\ndeliver the \u201cright results\u201d with respect to what\u2019s\ntrue about the past. To illustrate, consider the following natural\nprogression of an object through time. Our story begins with a green\nbanana. Time passes; the banana ripens. The banana is now yellow, but\nit was green. The world now instantiates the property having\ncontained a green banana (so says the Lucretian). So far, so\ngood. But consider a progression where the banana ripens and yet the\nworld comes to instantiate a different Lucretian property. Suppose\nthat the world instantiates having contained a red banana\ninstead. This is problematic. In the scenario imagined, though it was\nthe case that the world contained a green banana, <There was a\ngreen banana> is false; and, despite the world never having\ncontained a red banana, <There was a red banana> is true.\nAlthough the problematic progression is deviant, the worry with\nproperty solutions is that these kinds of progression appear\npossible, given the advertised metaphysic. If such deviant\nprogressions are possible, we can object to these present entities\nbeing the right kind of truth-makers for truths about the past (see\nTallant & Ingram 2012; Cameron 2013; Leininger 2015).\n\nA second concern with \u201cproperty solutions\u201d stems from the\nworry that the kind of properties involved, e.g., tensed\n\u201cLucretian\u201d properties, are wholly objectionable. Some\nregard properties such as having contained dinosaurs as\n\u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cdubious\u201d entities\u2014they\nare objectionable entities that shouldn\u2019t be countenanced in a\nrespectable metaphysic. They are objectionable because, in a sense\nthat\u2019s difficult to pin down, they point beyond their\ninstances (their bearers). Thus, having contained dinosaurs\nis a property that \u201cpoints beyond\u201d how the world is\nnow; it points beyond the intrinsic nature of its bearer, and\n\u201cpoints\u201d to how the world was; namely, containing\ndinosaurs. And, say the objectors, acceptable properties aren\u2019t\nlike that; respectable properties don\u2019t point beyond (see Sider\n2001: 39\u201342; Crisp 2007: 93\u201398; Merricks 2007:\n134\u20136; Cameron 2011: 58\u201362).\n\nAnother significant objection facing presentist attempts to solve the\ntruth-maker objection is based on \u201caboutness\u201d intuitions\nand their role in determining which entity (or entities) is an\nadequate truth-maker for some truth. The idea goes as follows. A truth\n(any truth) is about something. If a proposition is made true\u2014if\na proposition \u201cowes its truth\u201d to something in the\nworld\u2014then the thing in the world that makes the proposition\ntrue should be what the truth is about (Merricks 2007: 28\u201334).\nAfter all, <Taylor loves to sing> is about Taylor and her love\nof singing. It would be altogether wrong for that proposition to be\nmade true by the existence of anything other than Taylor and her love\nof singing. At least, so goes the thought.\n\nHowever, all these \u201csolutions\u201d to the truth-maker\nobjection share a common feature: the past entities that propositions\nabout the past seem to be about don\u2019t exist, given\npresentism. Marie Curie doesn\u2019t exist, yet <Curie existed>\nis about Curie. There are no dinosaurs, yet <there were\ndinosaurs> is about them. Our \u201caboutness\u201d\nintuitions tell us that propositions about the past should be\nmade true by past entities, but they simply cannot be, given\npresentism. Whether the truth-makers we posit exist now, or\nexist outside time, the kind of entities that we posit won\u2019t be\nup to the task. If we respect the aboutness constraint (on truth-maker\ntheory), and cannot shake off this objection, we will likely be\ninclined to give up on solving the objection by attempting to locate\nthe required truth-makers. (There are some exceptions. E.g., Ingram\n2019 develops a Bigelow-style response and argues that the putative\ntruth-makers, uninstantiated thisnesses, do satisfy aboutness\nintuitions.)\n6.2 Deny the Need for Truth-Makers\n\nRecall, the claims that generate the truth-maker objection: (i)\npresentism, (ii) there are truths about the past, and (iii)\ntruth-maker theory. By locating truth-makers for truths about the\npast, we attempt to reconcile all three claims. But another strategy\nis to simply deny (iii), to assert that truths about the past\ndon\u2019t require truth-makers.\n\nThis way of approaching matters has been mooted (e.g., Tallant 2009b;\nIngthorsson 2017), but it hasn\u2019t received a huge amount of\nsupport. This is due, at least in part, to the fact that it can be\nviewed as a partial response. We can deny that truths about the past\nrequire truth-makers, but we must go further to explain what to say\ninstead about their truth. Presumably something must be said,\nif we hope to account for them. We can\u2019t say, simply, that\ntruths about the past require no truth-makers and then say nothing\nmore about what they require. And while we might look to replace\ntruth-maker theory with something less ontologically committing,\npresentists haven\u2019t been forthcoming with an account of how\ntruths get to be true, if not by some kind of truth-making\naccount.\n6.3 The Truth-Making Relation isn\u2019t Existence-Entailing\n\nAll of this leads us to the final option that we will consider here.\nNamely, that the truth-maker relation isn\u2019t existence-entailing.\nThis kind of approach, described elsewhere as \u201cnefarious\u201d\n(contrasted with the \u201cupstanding\u201d project of locating\ntruth-makers), uses the language of truth-making without positing\ntruth-makers for truths about the past. In presenting the nefarious\nstrategy, we can treat it as something like the union of two theses:\n(1) truths about the past are expressed using primitive and\nunanalysable tense operators, and (2) tense operators don\u2019t pick\nout a distinctive ontological category or aspect of reality. This sort\nof nefarious approach has been pursued recently by Tallant (2009a),\nSanson & Caplan (2010), and Baia (2012), amongst others. The\nlabels (\u201cnefarious\u201d and \u201cupstanding\u201d) are due\nto a recent discussion by Tallant & Ingram (2015).\n\nTo clarify: nefarious \u201ccheats\u201d (like Tallant) will say\n\u201c<It was the case that p> is true, because it was the case\nthat p\u201d. \u201cWas\u201d is primitive and unanalysable, and\nthose adopting this position will agree that \u201cwas\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t pick out any ontology; it doesn\u2019t help us to speak\nof a distinctive metaphysical category. To that extent, those in this\n\u201cnefarious\u201d camp, will agree that there are truths about\nthe past, and will agree that how the world was makes true\nhow things are, but they deny that the ensuing truth-maker\n\u201crelation\u201d (such as it is) between the past and the\npresent (i.e., the true propositions) is existence-entailing. For\nsome, that might simply be considered treacherous. How might\npresentists motivate the nefarious position?\n\nOne key motivation involves a comparison with the\n\u201cupstanding\u201d approaches\n (\u00a76.1)\n and the first problem we raised, viz. getting the\n\u201cright results\u201d. If we think that there are truth-makers,\nthen we must ensure that the truth-making entities get things right.\nThat is, if the world contained a green banana, then it had always\nbetter be true, any time after the fact, that a truth-maker exists for\n<There was a green banana> (rather than, say, a truth-maker for\n<There was a red banana>, in the case where the world never\ncontained a red banana). But notice, then, that this seems to imply\nsome kind of \u201cfixing\u201d relation; how the world was\n(containing a green banana, not containing a red banana) serves to\n\u201cfix\u201d what truth-makers exist now.\n\u201cFixing\u201d is, plausibly, a relation. And, if x\nfixes y then, intuitively, both x and y\nmust exist; both relata of the fixing relation should exist. But on\nthe presentist picture, that\u2019s unacceptable. Past things\ndon\u2019t exist. In that case, the required \u201cfixing\u201d\nrelation isn\u2019t existence-entailing; it doesn\u2019t require the\nexistence of both relata. And, if that\u2019s right, then presentists\nmay as well \u201ccut out the middleman\u201d (so to speak) and\ntreat the truth-making relation as\n\u201cnon-existence-entailing\u201d and avoid any ontological\ninflation. Presentists don\u2019t require ontological commitment to\npresent truth-makers (ersatz times, Lucretian properties, etc.) for\ntruths about the past. They can do without. (See Ingram 2019:\n179\u201392 for critical discussion.)\n\nIs presentism out of the woods when it comes to the truth-maker\nobjection? It\u2019s unclear. For instance, we might retain the worry\nthat any relation must be existence-entailing and that what this shows\nis that we should give up on presentism (see, e.g., Baron 2013). And,\neven if we can solve the truth-maker objection, there\u2019s a\nclosely related concern that looks like it will raise further\nproblems. (We discuss the related concern in what remains of this\nsection.)\n6.4 Truths about Spans of Time\n\nIt\u2019s true that there have been seven English Kings called\n\u201cEdward\u201d. Is presentism compatible with that claim? How\nshould we interpret the semantics? At no point in history were there\nall seven Kings; the Edwards weren\u2019t contemporaneous. But, if\nthe Edwards didn\u2019t all exist together, then how can <There\nhave been 7 English Kings called \u201cEdward\u201d> be true?\nPresentism faces a novel problem regarding truths about the past when\nsuch truths concern \u201cspans\u201d of time (see Lewis 2004).\nAfter all, the natural reading is false: it was the case that\n\u201cthere are 7 English Kings called\n\u2018Edward\u2019\u201d.\n\nTwo routes suggest themselves as plausible avenues to explore. The\nfirst is to try to make sense of talk of spans by using talk of\nindividual times. Following the literature, call these \u201cslice\noperators\u201d. The idea, then, is that we say that\n\n\nIt WAS the case that [\u201c<There is a King called\nEdward>, and it WAS the case that [<There is a King\ncalled Edward>, and\u2026.]]\u201d\n\n\nSomewhat loosely, we can describe this as analyzing the span in terms\nof the individual \u201cslices\u201d that would make it up, were\nsuch a thing as a \u201cspan\u201d to exist.\n\nThere are many difficulties with this kind of approach. The most\nobvious challenge is that, in the above, the second iteration of our\ntense operator, \u201cWAS\u201d appears within the scope of the\nfirst. Thus, the attempted paraphrase of <There have been 7 English\nKings called \u201cEdward\u201d> is a sentence of the form\n\u201cthere has been a king called \u2018Edward\u2019, and there\nhad been a king called \u2018Edward\u2019\u2026\u201d. For one\nthing, however, suppose that there have been infinitely many entities\nin the past. Kings will not be a useful candidate here, so imagine\ninstead that there have been infinitely many electrons. Hence,\n<There have been infinitely many electrons> is true. But this\nrequires a construction with an infinite number of nested quantifiers\nand tense operators. This won\u2019t do, for no such construction can\nbe generated, despite the fact that we clearly can utter a\nsentence that expresses the relevant proposition, \u201cthere have\nbeen infinitely many electrons\u201d.\n\nAnother important problem for the translation approach is that there\nseem to be cases in which the paraphrase is false and yet the\nparaphrased sentence is true. Consider a merely possible case in which\nsome of the past Kings were instantaneous and simultaneous. (If this\nis too implausible in the case of Kings, given facts about royal\nsuccession, then swap the case for one involving physical particles\nwhich can be instantaneous and simultaneous.)\n\nThe second route sees us endorsing a primitive \u201cspan\u201d\noperator, an operator that picks out temporal intervals rather than\nindividual moments (see Lewis 2004: 12). Rather than try to analyze\nthe span in terms of slices, this approach sees us just endorsing a\nspan operator as a primitive piece of terminology. Berit Brogaard\n(2007) introduces this strategy neatly, as follows:\n\n\nWhere the usual slice operators mean (as the eternalist would put it)\n\u201cat some past (or future) moment\u201d, a span operator means\n\u201cat some past (or future) interval\u201d ([Lewis] 2004: 12).\nThus, where \u201cit HAS been that\u201d is the past-tense span\noperator, Lewis suggests that we translate \u201cthere have been two\nkings named Charles\u201d as \u201cit HAS been that (there are two\nkings named Charles)\u201d. By eternalist lights, this means that\n\u201cit is true of some interval in the past that there are two\nkings named Charles\u201d ([Lewis] 2004: 12). The presentist, of\ncourse, cannot accept this translation, but must presumably treat span\noperators as primitives. (2007: 73)\n\n\nThere are also problems with this route. First, it seems that such\nspan operators introduce ambiguities. Let\u2019s introduce the span\noperator \u201cHAS\u201d as the operator \u201cit has been the case\nthat\u2026\u201d and consider a target sentence, \u201cfirst it\nwas raining and then the sun shone\u201d. Then, suppose that we\nparaphrase this as: \u201cHAS (it is raining and the sun is\nshining)\u201d. This is problematically ambiguous. The paraphrase\nmight mean that there has been an interval of time throughout which it\nhas both been the case that the sun has shone and it has rained. Or,\nit might mean that there is an interval of time, throughout a\nsub-interval of which the sun shone and throughout another\nsub-interval of which it rained. Clearly, we want the latter; but with\nHAS, at least as stated, we have no means of differentiating the two.\nIf the semantics of the span operator are ambiguous, then it\ndoesn\u2019t give us a sensible semantics for span-talk (cf. Tallant\n& Ingram 2020).\n\nAs should be clear, merely solving the truth-maker objection\ndoesn\u2019t automatically address this problem of spans. The\ntruth-maker objection rests upon the fact that presentists apparently\nlack the ontological resources required to accommodate truth-making.\nThe span objection rests upon the fact that, given presentism, it is\nfar from clear how to provide an adequate regimentation of the\nsemantics of ordinary language. Bringing together an adequate\nsemantics as well as an adequate ontology is no easy task.\n7. Temporal Passage\n\nNext, we turn to an objection to presentism that concerns the idea\nthat time really passes. The challenge, put simply: presentism\nisn\u2019t compatible with time\u2019s passage. This is a problem\nsince presentism is a view that requires that reality is\n\u201cdynamic\u201d and that there is a change in what exists over\ntime, which is usually described in terms of the passage of time. (For\nthe purpose of this entry, we ignore general arguments to the\nconclusion that time doesn\u2019t really pass and, instead, focus on\nspecific challenges to presentism.)\n\nWhy think that presentism isn\u2019t compatible with passage?\nTypically, the passage of time is expressed in the following terms:\nwhat\u2019s future approaches the present, becoming less future, and\nwhat\u2019s past recedes from the present, becoming more past. Prima\nfacie, there\u2019s a problem. What\u2019s apparently required for\nthe truth of this passage metaphor is inconsistent with the view that\nonly present things exist. There are no future things, so nothing can\napproach the present; nor are there past things, so nothing recedes\nfrom the present. To defend presentism, we have to suggest another way\nto interpret the claim that time really passes.\n\nOne way to reinterpret the claim is as follows: there\u2019s change\nin what exists over time. Put another way: what\u2019s present\nchanges. But it\u2019s unclear whether this solves the problem or\nshifts it down the road. What\u2019s required in order to account for\nthe claim that \u201cwhat\u2019s present changes\u201d? One might\nreasonably suppose that to assert that what\u2019s present changes,\nfrom one moment to the next, we require a difference in the character\nof successive moments (see Leininger 2015). But there are no such\nsuccessive moments, given presentism. There\u2019s only the present\nmoment and its contents.\n\nIn defense of presentism, we might insist that what exists\nnow is sufficient to account for the difference in character\nof successive present moments. Some of the strategies used in reply to\nthe truth-maker objection are useful here. Consider, e.g., ersatz\npresentists who posit abstract times that represent how things were,\nare, and will be, when a given time is present (when it\u2019s\n\u201ctrue\u201d) (see Markosian 2004; Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007).\nErsatz presentism has the resources to assert that things really\nchange (and so time really passes); there\u2019s a difference between\nthe character of successive moments, given the manifold of ersatz\ntimes. How things are at the present time is different from how things\nwere (represented by an abstract time). Indeed, it seems that any\nversion of presentism that posits presently existing entities to\naddress worries about cross-time relations, for instance, or as\nputative \u201contological grounds\u201d for truths about the past,\ncan use such entities to establish that there\u2019s a difference\nbetween successive moments without reifying any non-present\nthings.\n\nAt this point, however, a new question arises. So understood,\npresentism has the resources to ground time\u2019s passing at only\nthe present time. That is, everything required to establish that\nthings change from one moment to the next must be contained within a\nsingle moment, the present. But within such a version of presentism,\nwhat guarantees that things really change? Or, to\napproach the same point differently, what in the metaphysics\nguarantees that the present resources accurately reflect how\nthings were\u2014e.g., why think that the ersatz manifold\naccurately represents the past\u2014when there\u2019s no connection\nto the past? Why can\u2019t reality consist of a single\n\u201cfrozen\u201d slice of concrete time, along with the various\nersatz times? If reality is that way (what\u2019s concrete never\nchanges and we have nothing more than a frozen concrete instant\nagainst the backdrop of many ersatz times), then we still have no\ntemporal passage. What the presentist must do is find some way of\ninsisting that reality cannot be such; reality cannot include but a\nsingle concrete slice coupled to truth-makers for talk about the past\nand future, where those truthmakers cannot be said to\nguarantee that things really change (cf. the\ndiscussion of how truth-makers get the \u201cright results\u201d\nfrom\n \u00a76).\n8. Relativistic Physics\n\nIn preceding sections, we examined problems facing presentism that\ncome from metaphysical quarters. In particular, we looked at a problem\nof \u201ccross-temporal relations\u201d\n (\u00a74),\n and discussed two instances of that general problem, which pose\nspecial problems for presentism (\u00a7\u00a75\u20136), before\nexamining a related challenge concerning temporal passage. Now, though\nthere are many worries for presentism that come from metaphysics,\nperhaps the most serious objection to presentism comes from physics.\nIn particular, the special theory of relativity (\u201cSTR\u201d)\nhas been presented as in direct tension with presentism. [See the\nentry on\n being and becoming in modern physics.]\n\nSimon Saunders (2002) gives us a clear picture of how things\nsupposedly stand with respect to presentism and STR, as follows:\n\n\nAccording to presentism, all that is physically real is the\npresent\u2014a system of physical events all of which are\nsimultaneous with each other. No other events are real. Precisely what\nthis system of events may be, now, as I snap my fingers, may not be\nknown to me; but there is a fact of the matter as to what it is, and\nit is a universal fact which embraces us all. It is an intersubjective\nreality\u2014now, as a snap my fingers\u2014and it is a reality\nwhich contains us only as an incidental part. But even if one knew all\nthat there is to know, consistent with special relativity, one would\nnot be able to say what this system of events might be. According to\npresentism, therefore, special relativity is radically deficient as a\ndescription of reality. It is blind to the sequencing of what is\nphysically real. (2002: 279\u201380)\n\n\nA quick and dirty reply on behalf of presentism is to suggest that\nmetaphysics and science are, in some sense, demarcated disciplines.\nThat is, the findings of physics are of no relevance to our best\nmetaphysics (and vice versa). But this doesn\u2019t seem to be a move\nthat we should make. Both metaphysicians and physicists are, surely,\ntrying to uncover the structure of the world and to theorize about the\nnature of reality (fundamental or otherwise). To ignore one another is\nno way for protagonists to carry on when both aim at the same basic\ngoal. Of course, this means that we must say something in reply to\nSaunders and others, who raise the same sort of objection (e.g.,\nPutnam 1967; Stein 1968, 1970; Savitt 1994, 2000; Sider 2001:\n42\u201352; W\u00fcthrich 2013; cf. Emery 2019, 2021). But what can\nbe said?\n\nKatherine Hawley (2006) suggests two routes: \u201cUndermining\u201d\nor \u201cCounterargument\u201d (we introduce each in turn). Suppose\nthat, as seems to be the case in the debate concerning STR, we want to\nargue that some metaphysics, posited by science, is false. That is,\nthe science, as it\u2019s traditionally interpreted, delivers the\n\u201cwrong\u201d metaphysics. There are options (though, as Hawley\nnotes, it seems likely that any genuine attempt to respond to the\nobjection from relativity may require a little of each). First,\n\u201cUndermining\u201d:\n\n\nThis is the attempt to show that the scientific metaphysics is not\ninvolved in generating novel prediction, and thus that its appearance\nin a scientific theory does not give us reason to think it true.\n(2006: 463)\n\n\nAs Hawley notes, there\u2019s a second step to Undermining, since\nmerely establishing that the metaphysics implied by the traditional\ninterpretation of a scientific hypothesis isn\u2019t essential to the\nscientific theory, doesn\u2019t establish that the metaphysics with\nwhich we would seek to replace the scientific metaphysics is\npreferable. We need to do more than show that the metaphysics implied\nby traditional interpretation and the metaphysics that we prefer are\non a par. We need to show that the\n\u201cmetaphysically-supported\u201d metaphysics is on a stronger\nfooting than the \u201cscientifically-supported\u201d\nmetaphysics.\n\nUndermining is a strategy that a number of metaphysicians have\nplausibly looked to deploy, arguing that there are empirically\nequivalent theories that differ with respect to metaphysical\ncommitments, but yield the same predictions. For instance, see Craig\n(2001) and Markosian (2004); Zimmerman (2011) explores a range of\noptions.\n\nConsider a case: if a rod, R, is traveling in direction d and\nis observed by an observer, O, who is stationary with respect\nto R, then R will appear to be length l.\nIf, however, O is in motion with respect to R,\nmoving toward it, then the length of R will appear, to\nO, to be less than l. There are two competing\nexplanations we might give, a standard \u201cspace-time\u201d\ninterpretation, as well as a \u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d\ninterpretation. (For philosophical defenders of the neo-Lorentzian\npicture, see Tooley 1997 and Craig 2001.)\u00a0As Balashov &\nJanssen (2003) have it:\n\n\n\u2026the space-time interpretation and the neo-Lorentzian\ninterpretation provide constructive theory explanations. In the\nspace-time interpretation, the model is Minkowski space-time and\nlength contraction is explained by showing that two observers who are\nin relative motion to one another and therefore use different sets of\nspace-time axes disagree about which cross section of the\n\u201cworld-tube\u201d of a physical system give the length of the\nsystem. In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation, length contraction is\nexplained by a combination of dynamical effects of measurement. (2003:\n331)\n\n\nNow, to endorse this \u201cUndermining\u201d approach, we would have\nto say that the neo-Lorentzian account is preferable to the space-time\naccount. And, problematically, that looks to be false. The problem is\nas follows. There\u2019s an explanatory advantage to treating length\ncontraction as explained by geometric features of space-time, rather\nthan by a dynamically occurring process. This, as we see below, will\nrequire us to postulate an unexplained brute fact as to why length\ncontraction and time dilation appear in laws governing all matter.\nSince unexplained coincidences, or treating certain facts as\n\u201cbrute\u201d, is suboptimal (particularly when, as Balashov\n& Janssen argue (2003: 341\u20132), the space-time interpretation\noffers a better explanation\u2014one that does not treat Lorentz\ninvariance as brute or mysterious), so we ought to deny the\nneo-Lorentzian interpretation of relativity.\n\nLet\u2019s try to get a better sense of this. What\u2019s the brute\nfact required of us? And why should we worry about it? Why should we\nthink that the neo-Lorentzian theory, which is acknowledged to be\nempirically equivalent to STR (Balashov & Janssen 2003: 23;\nCallender 2008: 52\u201353), offers an inferior explanation of both\nlength contraction and time dilation than does STR? Janssen (2002)\nputs the point as follows:\n\n\nFor Einstein, the Lorentz-transformed quantities are the correctly\nmeasured real quantities. In the final version of Lorentz\u2019s\ntheory, measurements never reveal the real quantities because all\nmeasurements are made with devices that are systematically distorted\nand improperly synchronized as a result of their and the\nobserver\u2019s motion through the ether. (2002: 429)\n\n\nThus, where for Lorentz, \u201cLorentz-invariance\u201d is a product\nof a law governing the dynamical behavior of entities in motion, for\nEinstein, Lorentz-invariance is simply a product of the geometry of\nspace-time. As Balashov & Janssen go on to argue:\n\n\nCompare the status of Lorentz invariance in the two interpretations.\nIn the former, Lorentz invariance reflects the structure of space-time\nposited by the theory. In the latter, Lorentz invariance is a property\naccidentally shared by all laws effectively governing systems in\nNewtonian space and time\u2026In the neo-Lorentzian interpretation\nit is, in the final analysis, an unexplained coincidence that the laws\neffectively governing different sorts of matter all share the property\nof Lorentz invariance. (2003: 341)\n\n\nSo, here\u2019s the detail of the objection. Lorentz\u2019s theory\nwas born of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics\n(Janssen 2002: 423): the latter incorporated electric and magnetic\nfields, but made no pronouncements at all concerning other forms of\nmatter. Thus, although we can extend the Lorentzian theory to\nall laws governing matter, we have no reason to do so. It just happens\nto turn out that the laws governing matter all instantiate this\nproperty. Craig Callender (2008) makes the point clearly, as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe matter fields are Lorentz invariant but the space-time is not. For\nthis reason, all else being equal, one ought to prefer the Einstein\nMinkowski interpretation to the Lorentz interpretation. Positing\notherwise unnecessary unobservable structure\u2014absolute\nsimultaneity\u2014does violence to Ockham\u2019s razor. (2008:\n53)\n\n\nCallender goes on to point out that once we grant that the Lorentz\ninterpretation is logically consistent and empirically adequate, the\nquestion becomes, \u201c[w]hat are a few lost explanatory virtues in\ncontrast to _______ (fill in the blank with whatever tenses\nexplain)?\u201d (2008: 53). After all, we have to posit an\nunobservable frame of reference and we don\u2019t, typically, posit\nunobservables without good reason. At the moment, we lack good reason,\nunless we think that the motivations for presentism (e.g., those\ndescribed in\n \u00a72)\n serve to persuade us that a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of the\nphysics of space-time is preferable to the space-time interpretation.\nUndermining thus looks to be a difficult road to plough.\n\nThe second option that Hawley (2006) describes,\n\u201cCounterargument\u201d, is as follows:\n\n\nThis alternative to Undermining accepts that the scientific\nmetaphysics is genuinely confirmed by the role it plays in generating\nempirical success, but claims that independent reasons to believe the\ntraditional metaphysics outweigh this scientific support. (2006:\n464)\n\n\nCounterargument is bold in the extreme. It seems to require that we\nsimply overturn the best physics on the basis of metaphysical\narguments. Perhaps we could take this line (but it seems a very\nchallenging route. The arguments for presentism (those stated in\n \u00a72,\n for instance) look somewhat underpowered when it comes to delivering\nthat result. The way in which counterarguers have typically tried to\nproceed, then, is by giving independent motivations for rejecting the\nspecial theory of relativity (both Crisp 2008 and Monton 2006 may be\nread as doing this).\u00a0An\u00a0interesting way to pursue this\nproject is to argue that STR is to be rejected on scientific grounds,\nrather than for some purely philosophical reason, suggesting that\nanother scientific theory (Quantum Mechanics, perhaps) requires\nabsolute simultaneity. This is the approach taken by\u00a0Tooley\n(1997: 335\u201371), though in defence of the growing block theory\nrather than presentism. Nonetheless, the orthodoxy remains strongly\nopposed to this kind of approach.\n",
