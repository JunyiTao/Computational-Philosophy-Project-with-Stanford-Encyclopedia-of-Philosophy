But Carruthers (2000) elaborates\nnicely on the distinction: A quality in the first-order sense presents\nitself as part of the world, not as part of one\u2019s mind. It is,\ne.g., the apparent color of an apparently physical object (or, if you\nare a Russellian, the color of a sense-datum that you happen to have\nencountered as an object of consciousness). A sensory quality is what\nthe world is or seems like. But what it is like to experience\nthat color is what your first-order perceptual state is like,\nintrinsically mental and experienced as such.\n\nHere are two further reasons for maintaining such a distinct sense of\nthe phrase. First, a sensory quality can be described in one\u2019s\npublic natural language, while what it is like to experience the\nquality seems to be ineffable. Suppose Ludwig asks Bertie, \u201cHow,\nexactly, does the after-image look to you as regards color?\u201d\nBertie replies, \u201cI told you, it looks green.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Ludwig, \u201cbut can you tell me what\nit\u2019s like to experience that \u2018green\u2019 look?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the image looks the same color as that,\u201d says\nBertie, pointing to George Edward\u2019s cloth coat. \u201cNo, I\nmean, can you tell me what it\u2019s like intrinsically, not\ncomparatively?\u201d \u201cUm,\u2026.\u201d \u2014In one way,\nBertie can describe the phenomenal color, paradigmatically as\n\u201cgreen.\u201d But when asked what it is like to experience that\ngreen, he goes mute. So there is a difference between (a) \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the bare sense of the quality, the\nphenomenal color that can be described using ordinary color words, and\n(b) \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to experience that phenomenal\ncolor, the WIL property, which cannot easily be described in public\nnatural language at all.\n\nSecond, Armstrong (1968), Nelkin (1989), Rosenthal (1991), and Lycan\n(1996) have argued that sensory qualities can fail to be conscious in\nthe earlier sense of awareness; a quality can occur without its being\neven slightly noticed by its subject. But in such a case, there is a\ngood sense in which it would not be like anything for the subject to\nexperience that quality. (Of course, in the first, Dretske-Tye sense\nthere would be something it was like, since the quality itself is\nthat. But in another sense, if the subject is entirely\nunaware of the quality, it is odd even to speak of the subject as\n\u201cexperiencing\u201d it, much less of there being something it\nis like for the subject to experience it.) So even in the case in\nwhich one is aware of one\u2019s quality, the second type of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like,\u201d the WIL property, requires\nawareness and so is something distinct from the quality itself.\n",
