    "main_text": "The Concept of a Nonexistent Object\n1. The Concept of a Nonexistent Object\n\nThe very concept of a \u201cnonexistent object\u201d has an air of\nparadox about it, at least for those philosophers whose thinking is\nrooted in the Humean tradition. For Hume suggested that to think of an\nobject is always and necessarily to think of an existent\nobject, or to put it differently, that to think of an object and to\nthink of the same object as existing are just one and the same thing.\nImmanuel Kant took up Hume\u2019s idea and claimed that existence is\nnot a \u201creal predicate\u201d, a claim that is often interpreted\nas an anticipation of Gottlob Frege\u2019s famous doctrine that\nexistence is not a predicate of individuals. (See Hume 2000, Book 1,\nPart 2, Sect. 6; Kant 2003, B 627; Frege 1966, pp. 37f.) Kant\u2019s\nmotivation for rejecting the view that existence is a \u201creal\npredicate\u201d was the so-called \u201contological proof\u201d of\nGod\u2019s existence, which says, roughly, that God\u2019s\nperfection entails God\u2019s existence, since a being that would\nhave all of God\u2019s perfections except existence (i.e.,\nomniscience, omnipotence, benevolence) would be less perfect than a\nbeing with the same perfections plus existence. For centuries,\nphilosophers have felt that there is something wrong with this proof,\nbut Kant was the first one who was able to point out a possible error:\nhe argued that the mistake of the \u201contological argument\u201d\nlies in the treatment of existence as a \u201creal\npredicate\u201d.\n\nIf Hume is right, then the concept of an object includes the concept\nof existence, and the concept of a nonexistent object would be as\nself-contradictory as the concept of a round square. If existence is\nnot a predicate of individuals, then one might suppose that neither is\nnonexistence. Therefore, if Frege is right, to say of an object that\nit is nonexistent is a kind of nonsense that arises from a violation\nof logical grammar. (For Frege and those who follow him, a claim like\n\u201cGod exists/does not exist\u201d is to be understood as a claim\nabout the concept God, or about the property of being God. On\nthis view, the logical form of \u201cGod exists\u201d is not\nExists (God)\u2014where Exists is a predicate of\nindividuals, but rather: The concept God applies to\nsomething, or Something possesses the property of being\nGod.)\n\nThus, in order to take the idea of nonexistent objects seriously, one\nhas to give up views held by important philosophers about the nature\nof existence and adopt the view that existence is some kind of\npredicate of individuals. This view entails, among other things, that\nto say, for instance, that some white elephants exist is to say that\nsome white elephants have the property of existence (or, to put it the\nother way around, that not all white elephants are\nnonexistent)\u2014a consequence that might strike some as\nstrange.\n\nFurthermore, in order to assert \u201cthere are nonexistent\nobjects\u201d without implying \u201cnonexistent objects\nexist\u201d, one has to suppose that sentences of the form\n\u201cThere are \\(F\\)s\u201d mean something different from\nsentences of the form \u201c\\(F\\)s\n exist\u201d.[1]\n Some philosophers reject a distinction between \u201cthere is\u201d\nand \u201cexists\u201d (see, for instance, Lewis 1990, Priest 2005,\nQuine 1953), some philosophers (e.g., Meinong 1960, Parsons 1980,\nZalta 1988) think that there are good reasons for making this\ndistinction. Some of the latter think that the distinction between\n\u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d is rooted in ordinary\nlanguage, but others deny this firmly (see, for instance, Geach 1971).\nObviously, although there might be a tendency among competent English\nspeakers to use \u201cthere is\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d in\ndifferent contexts, ordinary language use is too wavering and\nnon-uniform in this respect to be a stable ground for a philosophical\ntheory. Of course, this does not rule out that there are\ntheoretical reasons for a distinction between \u201cthere\nis\u201d and \u201cexists\u201d, some of which are discussed\nbelow.\n",
