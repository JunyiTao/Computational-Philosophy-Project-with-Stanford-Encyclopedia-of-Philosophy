    "preamble": "\n\nAs the theory of the atom, quantum mechanics is perhaps the most\nsuccessful theory in the history of science. It enables physicists,\nchemists, and technicians to calculate and predict the outcome of a\nvast number of experiments and to create new and advanced technology\nbased on the insight into the behavior of atomic objects. But it is\nalso a theory that challenges our imagination. It seems to violate\nsome fundamental principles of classical physics, principles that\neventually have become a part of western common sense since the rise\nof the modern worldview in the Renaissance. The aim of any\nmetaphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics is to account for\nthese violations.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation was the first general attempt to\nunderstand the world of atoms as this is represented by quantum\nmechanics. The founding father was mainly the Danish physicist Niels\nBohr, but also Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and other physicists made\nimportant contributions to the overall understanding of the atomic\nworld that is associated with the name of the capital of Denmark.\n\nIn fact Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand\nthe mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, and neither of them\never used the term \u201cthe Copenhagen interpretation\u201d as a\njoint name for their ideas. In fact, Bohr once distanced himself from\nwhat he considered to be Heisenberg\u2019s more subjective\ninterpretation (APHK, p.51). The term is rather a label\nintroduced by people opposing Bohr\u2019s idea of complementarity, to\nidentify what they saw as the common features behind the\nBohr-Heisenberg interpretation as it emerged in the late 1920s. Today\nthe Copenhagen interpretation is mostly regarded as synonymous with\nindeterminism, Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, Born\u2019s\nstatistical interpretation of the wave function, and Bohr\u2019s\ncomplementarity interpretation of certain atomic phenomena.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Background\n\nIn 1900 Max Planck discovered that the radiation spectrum of black\nbodies occurs only with discrete energies separated by the value\nh\u03bd, where \u03bd is the frequency and h is\na new constant, the so-called Planck constant. According to classical\nphysics, the intensity of this continuous radiation would grow\nunlimitedly with growing frequencies, resulting in what was called the\nultraviolet catastrophe. But Planck\u2019s suggestion was that if\nblack bodies only exchange energy with the radiation field in a\nproportion equal to h\u03bd that problem would disappear. The\nfact that the absorption and the emission of energy is discontinuous\nis in conflict with the principles of classical physics. A few years\nlater Albert Einstein used this discovery in his explanation of the\nphotoelectric effect. He suggested that light waves were quantized,\nand that the amount of energy which each quantum of light could\ndeliver to the electrons of the cathode, was exactly h\u03bd.\nThe next step came in 1911 when Ernest Rutherford performed some\nexperiments shooting alpha particles into a gold foil. Based on these\nresults he could set up a model of the atom in which the atom\nconsisted of a heavy nucleus with a positive charge surrounded by\nnegatively charged electrons like a small solar system. Also this\nmodel was in conflict with the laws of classical physics. According to\nclassical mechanics and electrodynamics, one might expect that the\nelectrons orbiting around a positively charged nucleus would\ncontinuously emit radiation so that the nucleus would quickly swallow\nthe electrons.\n\nAt this point Niels Bohr entered the scene and soon became the leading\nphysicist on atoms. In 1913 Bohr, visiting Rutherford in Manchester,\nput forward a mathematical model of the atom which provided the first\ntheoretical support for Rutherford\u2019s model and could explain the\nemission spectrum of the hydrogen atom (the Balmer series). The theory\nwas based on two postulates:\n\nAn atomic system is only stable in a certain set of states, called\nstationary states, each state being associated with a discrete energy,\nand every change of energy corresponds to a complete transition from\none state to another.\nThe possibility for the atom to absorb and emit radiation is\ndetermined by a law according to which the energy of the radiation is\ngiven by the energy difference between two stationary states being\nequal to h\u03bd.\n\n\nSome features of Bohr\u2019s semi-classical model were indeed very\nstrange compared to the principles of classical physics. It introduced\nan element of discontinuity and indeterminism foreign to classical\nmechanics:\n\n Apparently not every point in space was accessible to an electron\nmoving around a hydrogen nucleus. An electron moved in classical\norbits, but during its transition from one orbit to another it was at\nno definite place between these orbits. Thus, an electron could only\nbe in its ground state (the orbit of lowest energy) or an excited\nstate (if an impact of another particle had forced it to leave its\nground state.)\n It was impossible to predict when the transition would take place\nand how it would take place. Moreover, there were no external (or\ninternal) causes that determined the \u201cjump\u201d back again.\nAny excited electron might in principle move spontaneously to either a\nlower state or down to the ground state.\nRutherford pointed out that if, as Bohr did, one postulates that\nthe frequency of light \u03bd, which an electron emits in a\ntransition, depends on the difference between the initial energy level\nand the final energy level, it appears as if the electron must\n\u201cknow\u201d to what final energy level it is heading in order\nto emit light with the right frequency. \nEinstein made another strange observation. He was curious to know\nin which direction the photon decided to move off from the\nelectron.\n\n\nBetween 1913 and 1925 Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld and others were able to\nimprove Bohr\u2019s model, and together with the introduction of spin\nand Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle it gave a reasonably\ngood description of the basic chemical elements. The model ran into\nproblems, nonetheless, when one tried to apply it to spectra other\nthan that of hydrogen. So there was a general feeling among all\nleading physicists that Bohr\u2019s model had to be replaced by a\nmore radical theory. In 1925 Werner Heisenberg, at that time\nBohr\u2019s assistant in Copenhagen, laid down the basic principles\nof a complete quantum mechanics. In his new matrix theory he replaced\nclassical commuting variables with non-commuting ones. The following\nyear, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger gave a simpler formulation of the theory\nin which he introduced a second-order differential equation for a wave\nfunction. He himself attempted a largely classical interpretation of\nthe wave function. However, already the same year Max Born proposed a\nconsistent statistical interpretation in which the square of the\nabsolute value of this wave function expresses a probability amplitude\nfor the outcome of a measurement.\n2. Classical Physics\n\nBohr saw quantum mechanics as a generalization of classical physics\nalthough it violates some of the basic ontological principles on which\nclassical physics rests. Some of these principles are:\n\nThe principles of physical objects and their identity:\n\n\nPhysical objects (systems of objects) exist in space and time and\nphysical processes take place in space and time, i.e., it is a\nfundamental feature of all changes and movements of physical objects\n(systems of objects) that they happen on a background of space and\ntime;\nPhysical objects (systems) are localizable, i.e., they do not\nexist everywhere in space and time; rather, they are confined to\ndefinite places and times;\nA particular place can only be occupied by one object of the same\nkind at a time;\nTwo physical objects of the same kind exist separately; i.e., two\nobjects that belong to the same kind cannot have identical location at\nan identical time and must therefore be separated in space and\ntime;\nPhysical objects are countable, i.e., two alluded objects of the\nsame kind count numerically as one if both share identical location at\na time and counts numerically as two if they occupy different\nlocations at a time;\n\nThe principle of separated properties, i.e., two objects\n(systems) separated in space and time have each independent inherent\nstates or properties;\nThe principle of value determinateness, i.e., all\ninherent states or properties have a specific value or magnitude\nindependent of the value or magnitude of other properties;\nThe principle of causality, i.e., every event, every\nchange of a system, has a cause;\nThe principle of determination, i.e., every later state\nof a system is uniquely determined by any earlier state;\nThe principle of continuity, i.e., all processes\nexhibiting a difference between the initial and the final state have\nto go through every possible intervening state; in other words, the\nevolution of a system is an unbroken path through its state space; and\nfinally\nThe principle of the conservation of energy, i.e., the\nenergy of a closed system can be transformed into various forms but is\nnever gained, lost or destroyed.\n\n\nDue to these principles it is possible within, say, classical\nmechanics, to define a state of a system at any later time with\nrespect to a state at any earlier time. So whenever we know the\ninitial state consisting of the system\u2019s position and momentum,\nand know all external forces acting on it, we also know what will be\nits later states. The knowledge of the initial state is usually\nacquired by observing the state properties of the system at the time\nselected as the initial moment. Furthermore, the observation of a\nsystem does not affect its later behavior or, if observation somehow\nshould influence this behavior, it is always possible to incorporate\nthe effect into the prediction of the system\u2019s later state.\nThus, in classical physics we can always draw a sharp distinction\nbetween the state of the measuring instrument being used on a system\nand the state of the physical system itself. It means that the\nphysical description of the system is objective because the definition\nof any later state is not dependent on measuring conditions or other\nobservational conditions.\n\nMuch of Kant\u2019s philosophy can be seen as an attempt to provide\nsatisfactory philosophical grounds for the objective basis of\nNewton\u2019s mechanics against Humean scepticism. Kant thus argued\nthat classical mechanics is in accordance with the transcendental\nconditions for objective knowledge. Kant\u2019s philosophy\nundoubtedly influenced Bohr in various ways, as many scholars in\nrecent years have noticed (Hooker 1972; Folse 1985; Honner 1987; Faye\n1991; Kaiser 1992; and Chevalley 1994). Bohr was definitely neither a\nsubjectivist nor a positivist philosopher, as Karl Popper (1967) and\nMario Bunge (1967) have claimed. He explicitly rejected the idea that\nthe experimental outcome is due to the observer. As he said: \u201cIt\nis certainly not possible for the observer to influence the events\nwhich may appear under the conditions he has arranged\u201d\n(APHK, p.51). Not unlike Kant, Bohr thought that we could\nhave objective knowledge only in case we can distinguish between the\nexperiential subject and the experienced object. It is a precondition\nfor the knowledge of a phenomenon as being something distinct from the\nsensorial subject, that we can refer to it as an object without\ninvolving the subject\u2019s experience of the object. In order to\nseparate the object from the subject itself, the experiential subject\nmust be able to distinguish between the form and the content of his or\nher experiences. This is possible only if the subject uses causal and\nspatial-temporal concepts for describing the sensorial content,\nplacing phenomena in causal connection in space and time, since it is\nthe causal space-time description of our perceptions that constitutes\nthe criterion of reality for them. Bohr therefore believed that what\ngives us the possibility of talking about an object and an objectively\nexisting reality is the application of those necessary concepts, and\nthat the physical equivalents of \u201cspace,\u201d\n\u201ctime,\u201d \u201ccausation,\u201d and\n\u201ccontinuity\u201d were the concepts \u201cposition,\u201d\n\u201ctime,\u201d \u201cmomentum,\u201d and \u201cenergy,\u201d\nwhich he referred to as the classical concepts. He also\nbelieved that the above basic concepts exist already as preconditions\nof unambiguous and meaningful communication, built in as rules of our\nordinary language. So, in Bohr\u2019s opinion the conditions for an\nobjective description of nature given by the concepts of classical\nphysics were merely a refinement of the preconditions of human\nknowledge.\n3. The Correspondence Rule\n\nThe guiding principle behind Bohr\u2019s and later Heisenberg\u2019s\nwork in the development of a consistent theory of atoms was the\ncorrespondence rule. The full rule states that a transition between\nstationary states is allowed if, and only if, there is a corresponding\nharmonic component in the classical motion (CW Vol. 3, p.\n479). Bohr furthermore realized that according to his theory of the\nhydrogen atom, the frequencies of radiation due to the\nelectron\u2019s transition between stationary states with high\nquantum numbers, i.e. states far from the ground state, coincide\napproximately with the results of classical electrodynamics. Hence in\nthe search for a theory of quantum mechanics it became a\nmethodological requirement to Bohr that any further theory of the atom\nshould predict values in domains of high quantum numbers that should\nbe a close approximation to the values of classical physics. The\ncorrespondence rule was a heuristic principle meant to make sure that\nin areas where the influence of Planck\u2019s constant could be\nneglected the numerical values predicted by such a theory should be\nthe same as if they were predicted by classical radiation theory.\n\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld core model of the atomic structure came into\ntrouble in the beginning of the 1920s due to the fact that it\ncouldn\u2019t handle an increasing number of spectroscopic phenomena.\nIn 1924 Wolfgang Pauli introduced a new degree of freedom according to\nwhich two electrons with the same known quantum numbers could not be\nin the same state. A year later, in 1925, Ralph Kronig, Georg\nUhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit explained this new degree of freedom by\nintroducing the non-classical concept of electron spin. It has been\nsuggested, however, that Pauli\u2019s proposal meant a lethal blow\nnot only to the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, but also to the correspondence\nprinciple because \u201chow to reconcile the classical periodic\nmotions presupposed by the correspondence principle with the\nclassically non-describable Zweideutigkeit of the\nelectron\u2019s angular momentum?\u201d (Massimi 2005, p. 73)\n\nAlthough the exclusion rule and the introduction of spin broke with\nthe attempt to explain the structure of the basic elements along the\nlines of the correspondence argument (as Pauli pointed out in a letter\nto Bohr) Bohr continued to think of it as an important methodological\nprinciple in the attempt to establish a coherent quantum theory. In\nfact, he repeatedly expressed the opinion that Heisenberg\u2019s\nmatrix mechanics came to light under the guidance of this very\nprinciple. In his Faraday Lectures from 1932, for instance, Bohr\nemphasizes: \u201cA fundamental step towards the establishing of a\nproper quantum mechanics was taken in 1925 by Heisenberg who showed\nhow to replace the ordinary kinematical concepts, in the spirit of the\ncorrespondence argument, by symbols referring to the elementary\nprocesses and the probability of their occurrence\u201d (CC,\np. 48). Bohr acknowledged, however, that the correspondence argument\nfailed too in those cases where particular non-classical concepts have\nto be introduced into the description of atoms. But he still thought\nthat the correspondence argument was indispensable for both structural\nand semantic reasons in constructing a proper quantum theory as a\ngeneralised theory from classical mechanics.\n\nIndeed, spin is a quantum property of the electrons which cannot be\nunderstood as a classical angular momentum. Needless to say, Bohr\nfully understood that. But he didn\u2019t think that this discovery\nruled out the use of the correspondence rule as guidance to finding a\nsatisfactory quantum theory. A lengthy quotation from Bohr\u2019s\npaper \u201cThe Causality Problem in Atomic Physics\u201d (1938)\ngives evidence for this:\n\nIndeed, as adequate as the quantum postulates are in the\nphenomenological description of the atomic reactions, as indispensable\nare the basic concepts of mechanics and electrodynamics for the\nspecification of atomic structures and for the definition of\nfundamental properties of the agencies with which they react. Far from\nbeing a temporary compromise in this dilemma, the recourse to\nessentially statistical considerations is our only conceivable means\nof arriving at a generalization of the customary way of description\nsufficiently wide to account for the features of individuality\nexpressed by the quantum postulates and reducing to classical theory\nin the limiting case where all actions involved in the analysis of the\nphenomena are large compared with a single quantum. In the search for\nthe formulation of such a generalization, our only guide has just been\nthe so called correspondence argument, which gives expression for the\nexigency of upholding the use of classical concepts to the largest\npossible extent compatible with the quantum postulates. (CC,\np.96)\n\n\nThis shows that, according to Bohr, quantum mechanics, as formulated\nby Heisenberg, was a rational generalization of classical mechanics\nwhen the quantum of action and the spin property were taken into\naccount.\n\nThe correspondence rule was an important methodological principle. In\nthe beginning it had a clear technical meaning for Bohr. It is\nobvious, however, that it makes no sense to compare the numerical\nvalues of the theory of atoms with those of classical physics unless\nthe meaning of the physical terms in both theories is commensurable.\nThe correspondence rule was based on the epistemological idea that\nclassical concepts were indispensable for our understanding of\nphysical reality, and it is only when classical phenomena and quantum\nphenomena are described in terms of the same classical concepts that\nwe can compare different physical experiences. It was this broader\nsense of the correspondence rule that Bohr often had in mind later on.\nHe directly mentioned the relationship between the use of classical\nconcepts and the correspondence principle in 1934 when he wrote in the\nIntroduction to Atomic Theory and the Description of\nNature:\n\n[T]he necessity of making an extensive use \u2026 of the classical\nconcepts, upon which depends ultimately the interpretation of all\nexperience, gave rise to the formulation of the so-called\ncorrespondence principle which expresses our endeavours to utilize all\nthe classical concepts by giving them a suitable quantum-theoretical\nre-interpretation (ATDN, p. 8)\n\n\nBohr\u2019s practical methodology stands therefore in direct\nopposition to Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend\u2019s historical view\nthat succeeding theories, like classical mechanics and quantum\nmechanics, are incommensurable. In contrast to their philosophical\nclaims of meaning gaps and partial lack of rationality in the choice\nbetween incommensurable theories, Bohr believed not just\nretrospectively that quantum mechanics was a natural generalization of\nclassical physics, but he and Heisenberg followed in practice the\nrequirements of the correspondence rule. Thus, in the mind of Bohr,\nthe meaning of the classical concepts did not change but their\napplication was restricted. This was the lesson of\ncomplementarity.\n4. Complementarity\n\nAfter Heisenberg had managed to formulate a consistent quantum\nmechanics in 1925, both he and Bohr began their struggle to find a\ncoherent interpretation for the mathematical formalism. Heisenberg and\nBohr followed somewhat different approaches. Where Heisenberg looked\nto the formalism and developed his famous uncertainty principle or\nindeterminacy relation, Bohr chose to analyze concrete experimental\narrangements, especially the double-slit experiment. In a way Bohr\nmerely regarded Heisenberg\u2019s relation as an expression of his\ngeneral notion that our understanding of atomic phenomena builds on\ncomplementary descriptions. At Como in 1927 he presented for the first\ntime his ideas according to which certain different descriptions are\nsaid to be complementary.\n\nBohr pointed to two sets of descriptions which he took to be\ncomplementary. On the one hand, there are those that attribute either\nkinematic or dynamic properties to the atom; that is,\n\u201cspace-time descriptions\u201d are complementary to\n\u201cclaims of causality\u201d, where Bohr interpreted the causal\nclaims in physics in terms of the conservation of energy and momentum.\nOn the other hand, there are those descriptions that ascribe either\nwave or particle properties to a single object. How these two kinds of\ncomplementary sets of descriptions are related is something Bohr never\nindicated (Murdoch 1987). Even among people, like Rosenfeld and Pais,\nwho claimed to speak on behalf of Bohr, there is no agreement. The\nfact is that the description of light as either particles or waves was\nalready a classical dilemma, which not even Einstein\u2019s\ndefinition of a photon really solved since the momentum of the photon\nas a particle depends on the frequency of the light as a wave.\nFurthermore, Bohr eventually realized that the attribution of\nkinematic and dynamic properties to an object is complementary because\nthe ascription of both of these conjugate variables rests on mutually\nexclusive experiments. The attribution of particle and wave properties\nto an object may, however, occur in a single experiment; for instance,\nin the double-slit experiment where the interference pattern consists\nof single dots. So within less than ten years after his Como lecture\nBohr tacitly abandoned \u201cwave-particle complementarity\u201d in\nfavor of the exclusivity of \u201ckinematic-dynamic\ncomplementarity\u201d (Held 1994).\n\nIt was clear to Bohr that any interpretation of the atomic world had\nto take into account an important empirical fact. The discovery of the\nquantization of action meant that quantum mechanics could not fulfill\nthe above principles of classical physics. Every time we measure, say,\nan electron\u2019s position, the apparatus and the electron interact\nin an uncontrollable way, so that we are unable to measure the\nelectron\u2019s momentum at the same time. Until the mid-1930s when\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen published their famous thought-experiment\nwith the intention of showing that quantum mechanics was incomplete,\nBohr spoke as if the measurement apparatus disturbed the electron.\nThis paper had a significant influence on Bohr\u2019s line of\nthought. Apparently, Bohr realized that speaking of disturbance seemed\nto indicate\u2014as some of his opponents may have understood\nhim\u2014that atomic objects were classical particles with definite\ninherent kinematic and dynamic properties. After the EPR paper he\nstated quite clearly: \u201cthe whole situation in atomic physics\ndeprives of all meaning such inherent attributes as the idealization\nof classical physics would ascribe to such objects.\u201d\n\nHence, according to Bohr, the state of the measuring device and the\nstate of the object cannot be separated from each other during a\nmeasurement but they form a dynamical whole. Bohr called this form of\nholism \u201cthe individuality\u201d of the atomic process. Thereby,\nhe had in mind not only that the interaction is uncontrollable but\nalso that the system-cum-measurement forms an inseparable unity due to\nthe entanglement \u2013 although Bohr\u2019s did not use this term\n(Faye 1991, 1994; Howard 1994, 2004).\n\nAlso after the EPR paper Bohr spoke about Heisenberg\u2019s\n\u201cindeterminacy relation\u201d as indicating the ontological\nconsequences of his claim that kinematic and dynamic variables are\nill-defined unless they refer to an experimental outcome. Earlier he\nhad often called it Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\nrelation\u201d, as if it were a question of a merely epistemological\nlimitation. Furthermore, Bohr no longer mentioned descriptions as\nbeing complementary, but rather phenomena or information. He\nintroduced the definition of a \u201cphenomenon\u201d as requiring a\ncomplete description of the entire experimental arrangement, and he\ntook a phenomenon to be a measurement of the values of either\nkinematic or dynamic properties.\n\nBohr\u2019s more mature view, i.e., his view after the EPR paper, on\ncomplementarity and the interpretation of quantum mechanics may be\nsummarized in the following points:\n\nThe interpretation of a physical theory has to rely on an\nexperimental practice.\nThe experimental practice presupposes a certain pre-scientific\npractice of description, which establishes the norm for experimental\nmeasurement apparatus, and consequently what counts as scientific\nexperience.\nOur pre-scientific practice of understanding our environment is an\nadaptation to the sense experience of separation, orientation,\nidentification and reidentification over time of physical\nobjects.\nThis pre-scientific experience is grasped in terms of common\ncategories like thing\u2019s position and change of position,\nduration and change of duration, and the relation of cause and effect,\nterms and principles that are now parts of our common language.\nThese common categories yield the preconditions for objective\nknowledge, and any description of nature has to use these concepts to\nbe objective.\nThe concepts of classical physics are merely exact specifications\nof the above categories.\nThe classical concepts\u2014and not classical physics\nitself\u2014are therefore necessary in any description of physical\nexperience in order to understand what we are doing and to be able to\ncommunicate our results to others, in particular in the description of\nquantum phenomena as they present themselves in experiments;\nPlanck\u2019s empirical discovery of the quantization of action\nrequires a revision of the foundation for the use of classical\nconcepts, because they are not all applicable at the same time. Their\nuse is well defined only if they apply to experimental interactions in\nwhich the quantization of action can be regarded as negligible.\nIn experimental cases where the quantization of action plays a\nsignificant role, the application of a classical concept does not\nrefer to independent properties of the object; rather the ascription\nof either kinematic or dynamic properties to the object as it exists\nindependently of a specific experimental interaction is\nill-defined.\nThe quantization of action demands a limitation of the use of\nclassical concepts so that these concepts apply only to a phenomenon,\nwhich Bohr understood as the macroscopic manifestation of a\nmeasurement on the object, i.e. the uncontrollable interaction between\nthe object and the apparatus.\nThe quantum mechanical description of the object differs from the\nclassical description of the measuring apparatus, and this requires\nthat the object and the measuring device should be separated in the\ndescription, but the line of separation is not the one between\nmacroscopic instruments and microscopic objects. It has been argued in\ndetail (Howard 1994) that Bohr pointed out that parts of the measuring\ndevice may sometimes be treated as parts of the object in the quantum\nmechanical description.\nThe quantum mechanical formalism does not provide physicists with\na \u2018pictorial\u2019 representation: the \u03c8-function\ndoes not, as Schr\u00f6dinger had hoped, represent a new kind of\nreality. Instead, as Born suggested, the square of the absolute value\nof the \u03c8-function expresses a probability amplitude for\nthe outcome of a measurement. Due to the fact that the wave equation\ninvolves an imaginary quantity this equation can have only a symbolic\ncharacter, but the formalism may be used to predict the outcome of a\nmeasurement that establishes the conditions under which concepts like\nposition, momentum, time and energy apply to the phenomena.\nThe ascription of these classical concepts to the phenomena of\nmeasurements rely on the experimental context of the phenomena, so\nthat the entire setup provides us with the defining conditions for the\napplication of kinematic and dynamic concepts in the domain of quantum\nphysics.\nSuch phenomena are complementary in the sense that their\nmanifestations depend on mutually exclusive measurements, but that the\ninformation gained through these various experiments exhausts all\npossible objective knowledge of the object.\n\n\nBohr thought of the atom as real. Atoms are neither heuristic nor\nlogical constructions. A couple of times he emphasized this directly\nusing arguments from experiments in a very similar way to Ian Hacking\nand Nancy Cartwright much later. What he did not believe was that the\nquantum mechanical formalism was true in the sense that it gave us a\nliteral (\u2018pictorial\u2019) rather than a symbolic\nrepresentation of the quantum world. It makes much sense to\ncharacterize Bohr in modern terms as an entity realist who opposes\ntheory realism (Folse 1986; Faye 1991). \n\nIt is because of the imaginary quantities in quantum mechanics (where\nthe commutation rule for canonically conjugate variable, p\nand q, introduces Planck\u2019s constant into the formalism\nby qp \u2212 pq = ih/2\u03c0 that quantum\nmechanics does not give us a \u2018pictorial\u2019 representation of\nthe world. Neither does the theory of relativity, Bohr argued, provide\nus with a literal representation, since the velocity of light is\nintroduced with a factor of i in the definition of the fourth\ncoordinate in a four-dimensional manifold (CC, p. 86 and p.\n105). Instead these theories can only be used symbolically to predict\nobservations under well-defined conditions. Therefore, many\nphilosophers have interpreted Bohr as an antirealist or an\ninstrumentalist when it comes to theories. However, Bohr\u2019s\nreference to the use of imaginary number in quantum mechanics as an\nargument for his rejection of a pictoral representation may seem\nmisplaced. The use of imaginary numbers is more a question about the\nconventional choice of scale whether measurements should be\nrepresented in terms of imaginary or real number than an indication of\na certain magnitude expressed in terms of these numbers is not real.\nDieks (2017) gives a nuanced discussion of Bohr\u2019s argument, and\nhe concludes that in the context of quantrum mechanics Bohr saw\nimaginary numbers to be associated with incompatible physical\nquantities. \n\nIn general, Bohr considered the demands of complementarity in quantum\nmechanics to be logically on a par with the requirements of relativity\nin the theory of relativity. He believed that both theories were a\nresult of novel aspects of the observation problem, namely the fact\nthat observation in physics is context-dependent. This again is due to\nthe existence of a maximum velocity of propagation of all actions in\nthe domain of relativity and a minimum of any action in the domain of\nquantum mechanics. And it is because of these universal limits that it\nis impossible in the theory of relativity to make an unambiguous\nseparation between time and space without reference to the observer\n(the context) and impossible in quantum mechanics to make a sharp\ndistinction between the behavior of the object and its interaction\nwith the means of observation (CC, p. 105).\n\nComplementarity is first and foremost a semantic and epistemological\nreading of quantum mechanics that carries certain ontological\nimplications. Bohr\u2019s view was, to phrase it in a modern\nphilosophical jargon, that the truth conditions of sentences ascribing\na certain kinematic or dynamic value to an atomic object are dependent\non the apparatus involved, in such a way that these truth conditions\nhave to include reference to the experimental setup as well as the\nactual outcome of the experiment. This claim is called Bohr\u2019s\nindefinability thesis (Murdoch 1987; Faye 1991). Hence, those\nphysicists who accuse this interpretation of operating with a\nmysterious collapse of the wave function during measurements\nhaven\u2019t got it right. Bohr accepted the Born statistical\ninterpretation because he believed that the \u03c8-function\nhas only a symbolic meaning and does not represent anything real. It\nmakes sense to talk about a collapse of the wave function only if, as\nBohr put it, the \u03c8-function can be given a pictorial\nrepresentation, something he strongly denied.\n\nIndeed, Bohr, Heisenberg, and many other physicists considered\ncomplementarity to be the only rational interpretation of the quantum\nworld. They thought that it gave us the understanding of atomic\nphenomena in accordance with the conditions for any physical\ndescription and the possible objective knowledge of the world. Bohr\nbelieved that atoms are real, but it remains a much debated point in\nrecent literature what sort of reality he believed them to have,\nwhether or not they are something beyond and different from what they\nare observed to be. Henry Folse argues that Bohr must operate with a\ndistinction between a phenomenal and a transcendental object. The\nreason is that this is the only way it makes sense to talk about the\nphysical disturbance of the atomic object by the measuring instrument\nas Bohr did for a while (Folse 1985, 1994). But Jan Faye has replied\nthat Bohr gave up the disturbance metaphor in connection with his\ndiscussion of the EPR thought-experiment because he realized that it\nwas misleading. Moreover, there is no further evidence in Bohr\u2019s\nwritings indicating that Bohr would attribute intrinsic and\nmeasurement-independent state properties to atomic objects (though\nquite unintelligible and inaccessible to us) in addition to the\nclassical ones being manifested in measurement (Faye 1991).\n5. The Use of Classical Concepts\n\nA central element in the Copenhagen Interpretation is Bohr\u2019s\ninsistence on the use of classical concepts both with respect to\ndescribing experimental results and endowing quantum formalism with an\nempirical interpretation. The special cognitive status ascribed to the\nclassical concepts is something Bohr stressed from the very beginning.\nHere is a quotation from 1934: \n\n\nNo more is it likely that the fundamental concepts of the classical\ntheories will ever become superfluous for the description of physical\nexperience. \u2026 It continues to be the application of these\nconcepts alone that makes it possible to relate the symbolism of the\nquantum theory to the data of experience (ATDN, p.16).\n Later he expressed the same view in an often quoted\npassage:\n\n\n\nIt is decisive to recognize that, however far the phenomena transcend\nthe scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all\nevidence must be expressed in classical terms. The argument is simply\nthat by the word \u2018experiment\u2019 we refer to a situation\nwhere we can tell to others what we have done and what we have learned\nand that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangement and\nof the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous\nlanguage with suitable application of the terminology of classical\nphysics (APHK, p. 39). \n\n\nBohr saw the classical concepts as necessary for procuring unambiguous\ncommunication about what happens in the laboratory. Classical concepts\nare indispensable, because they enable physicists to describe\nobservations in a clear common language, and because they are the ones\nby which the physicists connect the mathematical formalism with\nobservational content.\n\nOver the years, different authors have come up with different\nexplanations of why Bohr thought that classical concepts were\nunavoidable for the description of quantum phenomena. Here we\nshall group those explanations in relation to five different\nphilosophical frameworks: 1) Empiricism, 2) Kantianism, 3) Pragmatism,\n4) Darwinianism, and 5) Experimentalism.\n\nEmpiricism. This view is represented by the logical\npositivists. They believed that the interpretation of any scientific\ntheory should be grounded in empirical observations. No theory,\naccording the positivists, is cognitively meaningful unless its terms\ncan be connected to terms that are able to express results that would\nverify that theory. Observational terms refer directly to observable\nthings or observable properties of physical objects, whereas\ntheoretical terms are explicitly defined by correspondence rules\nconnecting them with the observational terms. Hence classical terms,\nlike position and momentum, are exactly such terms that enable\nphysicist to ascribe a physical meaning to quantum mechanics.\n\nKantianism. Many philosophers and physicists have recognized\na strong kinship between Kant and Bohr\u2019s thinking or a direct\nKantian influence on Bohr. In the thirties C.F. von Weizs\u00e4cker\nand Grete Hermann attempt to understand complementarity in the light\nof neo-Kantian ideas. As von Weizs\u00e4cker puts it many years later,\n\u201cThe alliance between Kantians and physicists was premature in\nKant\u2019s time, and still is; in Bohr, we begin to perceive its\npossibility\u201d. A series of modern scholars (Folse 1985; Honner\n1982, 1987; Faye 1991; Kaiser 1992; Chevalley 1994; Pringe 2009;\nCuffaro 2010; Bitbol 2013, 2017; and Kauark-Leite 2017) has also\nemphasized the Kantian parallels. Although these scholars find common\nthemes, they also disagree to what extent Kantian or neo-Kantian ideas\ncan be used as spectacles through which we may vision Bohr\u2019s\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, Cuffaro (2010)\nholds that any proper \u201cinterpretation of Bohr should\nstart with Kant\u201d, and that \u201ccomplementarity\nfollows naturally from a broadly Kantian epistemological\nframework.\u201d Kant\u2019s assumption was that our forms of\nintuition and our categories of thoughts constitute the transcendental\nconditions for the possibility of any objective experience. Thus,\nspace and time are referred to as the forms of intuition, and the\ncategories of understanding such as causation, unity, plurality, and\ntotality are the a priori concepts which the mind imposes on the sense\nimpressions that appear in our intuition. In a similar way, it is\nargued that Bohr saw concepts like space, time, causation, unity, and\ntotality as a priori categories that was necessary for any objective\ndescription of quantum phenomena, and that classical physics was an\nexplication and operationalization of these a priori concepts. \n\n Pragmatism. Some scholars have advocated for a more\npragmatic explanation of Bohr\u2019s thesis concerning the\nindispensability of classical concepts. Here the interpretation\nfocuses on how we experimentally get to know something about atoms. We\nfind out about atoms by interacting with atomic systems, not by\npicturing them, and the interaction are accounted for in terms of\nexperiential categories. The pragmatists typically reject the a priori\nstatus of the mind\u2019s categories as they take them to be\ncontingent. From a physical perspective it is a simple matter of facts\nthat we need classical language to understand our scientific practise;\nit does not require any philosophical justification (Dieks 2017).\nLikewise, Dorato (2017) compares Bohr\u2019s indispensable thesis to\nPeter Strawson\u2019s descriptive metaphysics according to which we\nall share a common conceptual scheme about the experiential world which\ncannot be given a further justification. Also Folse notes, in a\ncomparison between Bohr and I.C. Lewis, that classical concepts reflect\nour empirical needs and shared interests and may eventually change if\nthese needs and interests change (Folse 2017). The common language\ntogether with the development of a physical clarification of some\nbasic empirical concepts gave us the classical physics because such an\nimproved language enables us to communicate in an unambiguous and\nobjective manner about our observations. As Bohr puts it: \u201c...\neven when the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical\ntheories, the account of the experimental arrangement and the\nrecording of observations must be given in plain language, suitably\nsupplemented by technical physical terminology. This is a clear\nlogical demand, since the very word \u201dexperiment\u201c refers to\na situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we\nhave learned.\u201d (APHK, p. 71). The use of classical\nconcepts to grasp the world is beneficial for understanding each\nother. Such empirical concepts provide us with an objective\ndescription of the function and outcome of physical experiments.\n\nDarwinism. In several places Bohr speaks about the classical\nconcepts as embodied in our common language, which is adapted\nto account for our physical experiences. The selection of the\nword \u201cadapted to\u201d seems to indicate that Bohr relied on\nDarwin\u2019s theory of natural selection in his search for an\nexplanation. The classical concepts are indispensable for the\ndescription of our experience because we are forced by nature to use a\ncommon language that is adapted to reporting our visual\nexperiences, which again is a result of humans\u2019 adaptation to\ntheir physical environment (Faye, 2017). Apart from Bohr\u2019s use\nof the word \u201cadapted to\u201d, Bohr\u2019s former assistant\nLeon Rosenfelt, who was an ardent defender of Bohr\u2019s\ncomplementarity, explicitly suggests that \u201cthe complementary\nlogic\u201d is due to human evolution: \u201cI suspect the\ndevelopment of a computing and communication system like our brain\ndemands about that complexity of organization which has been reached\nby our own species in the course of evolution\u201d (Rosenfeld,\n(1961 [1979]), p.515). Natural selection installs certain permanent\nvisual cognitive schemes in our predecessors, and this cognitive\nadaptation explains why these schemes, later reflected in our common\nlanguage, gain a privileged epistemic status, and keep this status in\nphysics in terms of refined classical concepts.\n\nExperimentalism. Camilleri (2017) calls Bohr the philosopher\nof experiment. Others such as Perovic (2013) have also suggested that\nBohr was more occupied by understanding the outcome of quantum\nexperiments than by interpreting the quantum formalism. In his paper\nCamilleri proposes that the challenge Bohr was facing was that, on the\none hand, experimental observation requires a sharp separation of the\nexperiment and the observed object, and, on the other hand, because of\nwhat we today call entanglement, \u201cit is no longer possible\nsharply to distinguish between the autonomous behaviour of a physical\nobject and its inevitable interaction with other bodies serving as\nmeasuring instruments\u201d (CC, p.84). So, according to\nCamilleri, Bohr solved this challenge by making a distinguish between\nthe function and the structure of an experiment. \n\n\nBohr\u2019s central insight was that if a measuring instrument is to\nserve its purpose of furnishing us with knowledge of an\nobject \u2013 that is to say, if it is to be described\nfunctionally \u2013 it must be described classically. Of course, it\nis always possible to represent the experimental apparatus from a\npurely structural point of view as a quantum-mechanical system without\nany reference to its function. However, any functional description of\nthe experimental apparatus, in which it is treated as a means to an\nend, and not merely as a dynamical system, must make use of the\nconcepts of classical physics (Camilleri, 2017, pp.30\u201331).\n\n\nThis analysis explains not only why Bohr thought that classical\nconcepts were indispensable for interpretational purposes, but also\nindicates why he thought that properties like momentum, position, and\nduration could be attributed only to an atom object in relation to a\nspecific experimental arrangement. As Dieks (2017) mentions while\ndenying any deeper philosophical motivation on Bohr\u2019s part: the\nuse of classical concepts is part of the laboratory life. \u201cThis\nclassical description is basically just the description in terms of\neveryday language, generalized by the addition of physics terminology,\nand it is the one we de facto use to describe our\nenvironment\u201d (Dieks 2017). But because of quantum of action,\nsymbolized by Planck\u2019s constant, the function of experiments\nthat supply the physicists with exact information about space-time\ncoordinations is incompatible with experiments whose function it is to\nsupply them with exact information about energy and momentum.\n\nIndeed, there are both similarities and overlaps between some of the\nproposed explanations concerning the indispensability of classical\nconcepts. Yet, not all of the suggested explanations can be true. Even\nthough the aim of Bohr\u2019s effort is to give an empirical\ninterpretation of the quantum formalism, his empiricism is different\nfrom that of the logical positivists. He does not seek to reduce terms\nconcerning theoretical entities to terms about sense-data or purely\nperceptual phenomena. He insists only that the empirical evidence\nphysicists collect from their experiments on atomic objects has to be\ndescribed in terms of the same concepts which were developed in\nclassical mechanics in order for them to understand what the quantum\ntheory is all about.\n\nNevertheless, the various explanations all give us some hints into the\ncomplexity of Bohr\u2019s thinking concerning the description of\nphysical experiments. At different times, he seems to put emphasis on\none aspect rather than another, depending on the specific context of\ndiscussion. Sometimes he was occupied with the interpretation of\nexperiments, sometimes with the relationship between actual\nexperiments and the formulation of quantum mechanics. In emphasizing\nthe necessity of classical concepts for the description of quantum\nphenomena, Bohr might have been influenced by Kantian-like ideas or\nneo-Kantianism (Hooker, 1994). But if so, he was a naturalized or a\npragmatized Kantian. The classical concepts are merely explications of\ncommon-sense concepts that are already a result of our perceptual\nadaptation to the world. These concepts and the conditions of their\napplication determine the conditions for objective knowledge. The\ndiscovery of the quantization of action has revealed to us, however,\nthat we cannot apply these concepts to quantum objects as we did in\nclassical physics. The use of classical concepts in the domain of\nquantum mechanics has to be restricted with respect to their use in\nclassical mechanics. Now kinematic and dynamic properties (represented\nby conjugate variables) can be meaningfully ascribed to the object\nonly in relation to some actual experimental results, whereas\nclassical physics attributes such properties to the object regardless\nof whether we actually observe them or not. In other words, Bohr\ndenied that classical concepts could be used to attribute properties\nto a physical world in-itself behind the perceptual phenomena, i.e.\nproperties different from those being observed. In contrast, classical\nphysics rests on an idealization, he said, in the sense that it\nassumes that the physical world has these properties in-itself, i.e.\nas inherent properties, independent of their actual observation.\n6. The Interpretation of the Quantum Formalism\n\nClassical concepts serve the important function of connecting the\nquantum mechanical symbolism with experimental observations. If one\naccepts that Bohr\u2019s grasp of physics began with his\nunderstanding of the role of physical experiments, this understanding\nhad strong implications for his empirical interpretation of the\nquantum formalism. The modern scholarly debate has taken Bohr to be an\ninstrumentalist, an objective anti-realist (Faye 1991), a\nphenomenological realist (Shomar 2008), or a realist of various sorts\n(Folse 1985, 1994; Favrholdt 1994; MacKinnon 1994; Howard 1994, 2004;\nZinkernagel 2015, 2016). But very often the various participants do\nnot give an exact specification of how they understand these terms and\nhow these terms apply to Bohr\u2019s thinking. The whole discussion\nbecomes confused because different authors use terms like\n\u201crealism\u201d and \u201cantirealism\u201d differently in\nrelation to Bohr. For instance, Faye (1991) holds that Bohr is an\nentity realist but a non-representationalist concerning theories.\nTherefore he calls Bohr an objective antirealist. In contrast, Folse\n(1986) who also sees Bohr as both a entity realist and a theoretical\nnon-representationalist calls him a realist. Moreover, Bohr himself\nwould probably refuse to put any such labels on his own view.\n\nIt is certain that Bohr regarded atomic objects as real\n(ATDN, p.93 and p.103). Their existence has been confirmed by\ncountless experiments. Hence, phrased in a modern terminology Bohr\nmight be classified as an entity realist in the sense that\nexperiments reveal their classical properties in relation to an\nexperimental set-up. Such a view does not fit traditional\ninstrumentalism where the introduction of unobservable entities is a\nlogical construction in order to classify various empirical\nobservations together. But entity realism corresponds with objective\nanti-realism, phenomenological realist, and all other forms of realism\nbecause it does not indicate anything about one\u2019s attitude\ntowards theories. A further issue is then how to interpret a physical\ntheory. Does or doesn\u2019t the quantum formalism, according to\nBohr, represent the world over and above being a tool for prediction?\n\n\nHere are four statements which seem to show that Bohr was an\ninstrumentalist concerning scientific theories in general and the\nquantum formalism in particular.\n\nThe purpose of scientific theories \u201cis not to disclose the\nreal essence of phenomena but only to track down, so far as it is\npossible, relations between the manifold aspects of experience\u201d\n(APHK, p.71).\n\u201cThe ingenious formalism of quantum mechanics, which\nabandons pictorial representation and aims directly at a statistical\naccount of quantum processes \u2026\u201d (CC, p.\n152).\n\u201cThe formalism thus defies pictorial representation and aims\ndirectly at prediction of observations appearing under well-defined\nconditions\u201d (CC, p. 172).\n\u201cThe entire formalism is to be considered as a tool for\nderiving predictions of definite and statistical character\n\u2026\u201d (CC, p. 144).\n\n\nIn these four statements Bohr mentions the absence of \u201cpictorial\nrepresentation\u201d twice in relation to the quantum formalism. The\nterm \u201cpictorial representation\u201d stands for a\nrepresentation that helps us to visualize what it represents in\ncontrast to \u201csymbolic representation\u201d. A pictorial\nrepresentation is a formalism that has an isomorphic relation to the\nobjects it represents such that the visualized structure of the\nrepresentation corresponds to a similar structure in nature.\nConversely, a symbolic representation does not stand for anything\nvisualizable. It is an abstract tool whose function it is to calculate\na result whenever this representation is applied to an experimental\nsituation. With respect to the formalism of quantum mechanics it is\nparticularly one\u2019s interpretation of the wave function that\ndetermines whether one thinks of it symbolically as a tool for\ncalculation of statistical outcomes or thinks of is as representing a\nreal physical field.\n\nIn a close reading of the Como-paper, Dennis Dieks reaches the\nconclusion that \u201cThe notion that the lecture is meant to\npromulgate an instrumentalist interpretation of quantum theory\naccording to which the whole formalism possesses only mathematical and\nno physical descriptive content is thus immediately seen to sit\nuneasily with the textual evidence.\u201d (Dieks 2017, p.305). In\nother words, Dieks goes against the more general interpretation of\nBohr according to which Bohr only believed that the wave function\nformalism is a mere tool for prediction. Just because Bohr writes off\nquantum formalism as a pictoral representation, it still gives us some\ninsight into physical reality. First, Dieks points to another of\nBohr\u2019s argument against seeing Sch\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave\nfunction as representing anything real. This argument concerns the\nfact that the wave function in quantum mechanics cannot represent a\nthree-dimensional entity.\n\n\nBohr himself tells us that his second argument, about the\ndimensionality of configuration space, is the most important one:\n\u201cabove all there can be no question of an immediate\nconnexion with our ordinary conceptions because... the wave equation\nis associated with the so-called co-ordinate space.\u201d In other\nwords, the Schr\u00f6dinger wave in the case of a many-particle system\ncannot be a physical wave in three-dimensional space (which would be\nan \u201cordinary conception\u201d) since it \u201clives\u201d in\na high-dimensional mathematical space (Dieks 2017, p.308).\n\n\nThen Dieks argues that even though this is an argument against wave\nfunction realism, it is not an argument that excludes the wave\nfunction from containing information about the quantum world. Dieks\ncompares this argument to the one that denies phase space realism.\n\u201cWe can consistently deny the physical reality of phase space\nand still be realists with respect to particles. So we should not\nmistake Bohr\u2019s argument for the symbolic character of the wave\nfunction for an argument in favor of instrumentalism tout\ncourt\u201d (Dieks 2017, p. 308). The difference between\nclassical many-particles system placed in a phase space and a system\nof quantum objects placed in the configuration space is, however, that\nthe description of many particles in phase space can be decomposed\ninto a description of single particles in three-dimensional physical\nspace, whereas the sum of the quantum waves associated with many\nparticles in configuration space yields yet another superimposed\nquantum wave, which cannot be decomposed into a description of single\nparticles in three-dimensional space. Dieks then continues to show how\nthe structural features of the quantum formalism guided Bohr in his\ninterpretation of quantum mechanism. Likewise, he argues that\nBohr\u2019s pronouncements on the meaning of quantum mechanics should\nfirst of all be seen as responses to concrete physical problems,\nrather than as expressions of a preconceived philosophical doctrine.\nHis analysis results in a finding that Bohr\u2019s qualitative\ninterpretation is in line with modern non-collapse theories.\n7. Misunderstandings of Complementarity\n\nComplementarity has been commonly misunderstood in several ways, some\nof which shall be outlined in this section. First of all, earlier\ngenerations of philosophers and scientists have often accused\nBohr\u2019s interpretation of being positivistic or subjectivistic.\nToday philosophers have almost reached a consensus that it is neither.\nThere are, as many have noticed, both typically realist as well as\nantirealist elements involved in it, and it has affinities with Kant\nor neo-Kantianism. The influence of Kant or Kantian thinking on\nBohr\u2019s philosophy seems to have several sources. Some have\npointed to the tradition from Hermann von Helmholtz (Chevalley 1991,\n1994; Brock 2003); others have considered the Danish philosopher\nHarald H\u00f8ffding to be the missing link to Kantianism (Faye\n1991; and Christiansen 2006).\n\nBut because Bohr\u2019s view on complementarity has wrongly been\nassociated with positivism and subjectivism, much confusion still\nseems to stick to the Copenhagen interpretation. Don Howard (2004)\nargues, however, that what is commonly known as the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, regarded as representing a\nunitary Copenhagen point of view, differs significantly from\nBohr\u2019s complementarity interpretation. He holds that \u201cthe\nCopenhagen interpretation is an invention of the mid-1950s, for which\nHeisenberg is chiefly responsible, [and that] various other physicists\nand philosophers, including Bohm, Feyerabend, Hanson, and Popper,\nhav[e] further promoted the invention in the service of their own\nphilosophical agendas\u201d (p. 669).\n\nMore recently, Mara Beller (1999) argued that Bohr\u2019s statements\nare intelligible only if we presume that he was a radical\noperationalist or a simple-minded positivist. In fact, complementarity\nwas established as the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics in\nthe 1930s, a time when positivism was prevalent in philosophy of\nscience, and some commentators have taken the two to be closely\nassociated. During the 1930s Bohr was also in touch with some of the\nleading neopositivists or logical empiricists such as Otto Neurath,\nPhilip Frank, and the Danish philosopher J\u00f8rgen\nJ\u00f8rgensen. Although their anti-metaphysical approach to science\nmay have had some influence on Bohr (especially around 1935 during his\nfinal discussion with Einstein about the completeness of quantum\nmechanics), one must recall that Bohr always saw complementarity as a\nnecessary response to the indeterministic description of quantum\nmechanics due to the quantum of action. The quantum of action was an\nempirical discovery, not a consequence of a certain epistemological\ntheory, and Bohr thought that indeterminism was the price to pay to\navoid paradoxes. Never did Bohr appeal to a verificationist theory of\nmeaning; nor did he claim classical concepts to be operationally\ndefined. But it cannot be denied that some of the logical empiricists\nrightly or wrongly found support for their own philosophy in\nBohr\u2019s interpretation and that Bohr sometimes confirmed them in\ntheir impressions (Faye 2008).\n\nSecond, many physicists and philosophers see the reduction of the wave\nfunction as an important part of the Copenhagen interpretation. This\nmay be true for people like Heisenberg. But Bohr never talked about\nthe collapse of the wave packet. Nor did it make sense for him to do\nso because this would mean that one must understand the wave function\nas referring to something physically real. Only if one can interpret a\nquantum measurement as an interaction between an instrument and an\nobject, whose state is literally represented by\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave function, and therefore taken to contain\nall potential values of observation, does it make sense to claim that\nthe measurement forces the object to manifest one of these potential\nvales. Indeed, such a literal interpretation of the state vector\nimplies that these values are somehow intrinsically present in the\nobject with a certain probability all at once. In contrast, Bohr\nbelieved that particular kinematical and dynamical properties are\nrelational because their attribution to a quantum system makes sense\nonly in relation to a particular experimental set-up and therefore\nthat these numerical properties could have a specific value only\nduring a measurement.\n\nThird, Bohr flatly denied the ontological thesis that the subject has\nany direct impact on the outcome of a measurement. Hence, when he\noccasionally mentioned the subjective character of quantum phenomena\nand the difficulties of distinguishing the object from the subject in\nquantum mechanics, he did not think of it as a problem confined to the\nobservation of atoms alone. For instance, he stated that already\n\u201cthe theory of relativity reminds us of the subjective character\nof all physical phenomena\u201d (ATDN, p. 116). Rather, by\nreferring to the subjective character of quantum phenomena he was\nexpressing the epistemological thesis that all observations in physics\nare in fact context-dependent. There exists, according to Bohr, no\nview from nowhere in virtue of which quantum objects can be\ndescribed.\n\nFourth, although Bohr had spoken about \u201cdisturbing the phenomena\nby observation,\u201d in some of his earliest papers on\ncomplementarity, he never had in mind the observer-induced collapse of\nthe wave packet. Later he always talked about the interaction between\nthe object and the measurement apparatus which was taken to be\ncompletely objective. Thus, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat did not pose\nany riddle to Bohr. The cat would be dead or alive long before we open\nthe box to find out. What Bohr claimed was, however, that the state of\nthe object and the state of the instrument are dynamically inseparable\nduring the interaction. Moreover, the atomic object does not posses\nany state separate from the one it manifests at the end of the\ninteraction because the measuring instrument establishes the necessary\nconditions under which it makes sense to use the state concept.\n\nIt was the same analysis that Bohr applied in answering the challenge\nof the EPR-paper. Bohr\u2019s reply was that we cannot separate the\ndynamical and kinematical properties of a joint system of two\nparticles until we actually have made a measurement and thereby set\nthe experimental conditions for the ascription of a certain state\nvalue (CC, p. 80). Bohr\u2019s way of addressing the puzzle\nwas to point out that individual states of a pair of coupled particles\ncannot be considered in isolation, in the same way as the state of the\nobject and the state of the instrument are dynamically inseparable\nduring measurements. Thus, based on our knowledge of a particular\nstate value of the auxiliary body A, being an atomic object or an\ninstrument, we may then infer the state value of the object B with\nwhich A once interacted (Faye 1991, pp. 182\u2013183). It therefore\nmakes sense when Howard (2004, p.671) holds that Bohr considered the\npost-measurement joint state of the object and the measuring apparatus\nto be entangled as in any other quantum interaction involving an\nentangled pair.\n\nFinally, when Bohr insisted on the use of classical concepts for\nunderstanding quantum phenomena, he did not believe, as it is\nsometimes suggested, that macroscopic objects or the measuring\napparatus always have to be described in terms of the dynamical laws\nof classical physics. The use of the classical concepts is necessary,\naccording to Bohr, because by these we have learned to communicate to\nothers about our physical experience. The classical concepts are\nmerely a refinement of everyday concepts of position and action in\nspace and time. However, the use of the classical concepts is not the\nsame in quantum mechanics as in classical physics. Bohr was well aware\nof the fact that, on pains of inconsistency, the classical concepts\nmust be given \u201ca suitable quantum-theoretical\nre-interpretation,\u201d before they could be employed to describe\nquantum phenomena (ATDN, p. 8).\n8. The Divergent Views\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is not a homogenous view. This insight\nhas begun to emerge among historians and philosophers of science over\nthe last ten to fifteen years. Both James Cushing (1994) and Mara\nBeller (1999) take for granted the existence of a unitary Copenhagen\ninterpretation in their social and institutional explanation of the\nonce total dominance of the Copenhagen orthodoxy; a view they\npersonally find unconvincing and outdated partly because they read\nBohr\u2019s view on quantum mechanics through Heisenberg\u2019s\nexposition. But historians and philosophers of science have gradually\nrealized that Bohr\u2019s and Heisenberg\u2019s pictures of\ncomplementarity on the surface may appear similar but beneath the\nsurface diverge significantly. Don Howard (2004, p. 680) goes as far\nas concluding that \u201cuntil Heisenberg coined the term in 1955,\nthere was no unitary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum\nmechanics.\u201d The term apparently occurs for the first time in\nHeisenberg (1955). In addition, Howard also argues that it was\nHeisenberg\u2019s exposition of complementarity, and not\nBohr\u2019s, with its emphasis on a privileged role for the observer\nand observer-induced wave packet collapse that became identical with\nthat interpretation. Says he: \u201cWhatever Heisenberg\u2019s\nmotivation, his invention of a unitary Copenhagen view on\ninterpretation, at the center of which was his own, distinctively\nsubjectivist view of the role of the observer, quickly found an\naudience\u201d (p. 677). This audience included people like David\nBohm, Paul Feyerabend, Norwood Russell Hanson, and Karl Popper who\nused Heisenberg\u2019s presentation of complementarity as the target\nfor their criticism of the orthodox view. However, it should also be\nmentioned that in later work, Feyerabend (1968, 1969) was one of the\nfirst philosophers who gave a painstaking analysis of complementarity\nin order to clear up the myth of it being unintelligible. Feyerabend\nurged philosophers and physicists to go back to Bohr and read him\ncarefully.\n\nFollowing up on Don Howard\u2019s research, Kristian Camilleri (2006,\n2007) points to the fact that complementarity was originally thought\nby Bohr (in his Como-paper) to exist between the space-time\ndescription and the causal description of the stationary states of\natoms \u2014 and not between different experimental outcomes of the\nfree electron. So the formulation of complementarity was restricted to\nthe concept of stationary states because only there does the system\nhave a well-defined energy state independent of any measurement. This\nobservation deserves general recognition. But when Bohr rather soon\nthereafter began analysing the double slit experiment in his\ndiscussion with Einstein (1930), he had to extend his interpretation\nto cover the electron in interaction with the measuring apparatus.\n\nCamilleri then shows how Heisenberg\u2019s view of complementarity,\nin spite of Heisenberg\u2019s own testimony, radically differs from\nBohr\u2019s. As Heisenberg understood complementarity between the\nspace-time description and causal description, it holds between the\nclassical description of experimental phenomena and the description of\nthe state of the system in terms of the wave function. A quotation\nfrom Heisenberg (1958, p. 50) shows how much he misunderstood Bohr in\nspite of their previously close working relationship.\n\nBohr uses the concept of \u2018complementarity\u2019 at several\nplaces in the interpretation of quantum theory \u2026 The space-time\ndescription of the atomic events is complementary to their\ndeterministic description. The probability function obeys an equation\nof motion as did the co-ordinates in Newtonian mechanics; its change\nin the course of time is completely determined by the quantum\nmechanical equation; it does not allow a description in space and time\nbut breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by\nchanging our knowledge of the system.\n\n\nSo, where Bohr identified the causal description with the conservation\nof energy, Heisenberg saw it as the deterministic evolution of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s \u03c8-function. In other words,\nHeisenberg, in contrast to Bohr, believed that the wave equation gave\na causal, albeit probabilistic description of the free electron in\nconfiguration space. It also explains why so many philosophers and\nphysicists have identified the Copenhagen interpretation with the\nmysterious collapse of the wave packet. The transition from a causal\ndescription in terms of the evolution of the \u03c8-function\nto a classical space-time description is characterized by the\ndiscontinuous change that occurs by the act of measurement. According\nto Heisenberg, these two modes of description are complementary.\n\nIn another study Ravi Gomatam (2007) agrees with Howard\u2019s\nexposition in arguing that Bohr\u2019s interpretation of\ncomplementarity and the textbook Copenhagen interpretation (i.e.\nwave-particle duality and wave packet collapse) are incompatible. More\nrecently, Henderson (2010) has come to a similar conclusion. He makes\na distinction between different versions of Copenhagen interpretations\nbased on statements from some of the main characters. On one side of\nthe spectrum there is Bohr who did not think of quantum measurement in\nterms of a collapse of the wave function (for a contrasting view see\nJens Hebor 2005; and partly Zinkernagel 2016); in the middle we find\nHeisenberg talking about the collapse as an objective physical process\nbut thinking that this couldn\u2019t be analyzed any further because\nof its indeterministic nature, and at the opposite side Johann von\nNeumann and Eugene Wigner argued that the human mind has a direct\ninfluence on the reduction of the wave packet. Unfortunately, von\nNeumann\u2019s dualistic view has become part of the Copenhagen\nmethodology by people opposing this interpretation.\n9. The Measurement Problem and the Classical-Quantum Distinction\n\nApparently, we are living in a quantum world since everything is\nconstituted by atomic and subatomic particles. Hence classical physics\nseems merely to be a useful approximation to a world which is quantum\nmechanical on all scales. Such a view, which many modern physicists\nsupport, can be called quantum fundamentalism (Zinkernagel 2015,\n2016). It can be defined as a position containing two components: (1)\neverything in the Universe is fundamentally of quantum nature (the\nontological component); and (2) everything in the Universe is\nultimately describable in quantum mechanical terms (the\nepistemological component). Thus, we may define quantum fundamentalism\nto be the position holding that everything in the world is essentially\nquantized and that the quantum theory gives us a literal description\nof this nature. The basic assumption behind quantum fundamentalism is\nthat the structure of the formalism, in this case the wave function,\ncorresponds to how the world is structured. For instance, according to\nthe wave function description every quantum system may be in a\nsuperposition of different states because a combination of state\nvectors is also a state vector. Now, assuming that both the quantum\nobject and the measuring apparatus are quantum systems that each can\nbe described by a wave function, it follows that their entangled state\nwould likewise be represented by a state vector. Then the challenge\nis, of course, how we can explain why the pointer of a measuring\ninstrument enters a definite (and not a superposition) position, as\nexperience tells us, whenever the apparatus interacts with the object.\nIn a nutshell this is the measurement problem.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is often taken to subscribe to a\nsolution to the measurement problem that has been offered in terms of\nJohn von Neumann\u2019s projection postulate. In 1932 [1996], von\nNeumann suggested that the entangled state of the object and the\ninstrument collapses to a determinate state whenever a measurement\ntakes place.  This measurement process (a type 1-process as he called\nit) could not be described by quantum mechanics; quantum mechanics can\nonly described type-2 processes (i.e., the development of a quantum\nsystem in terms of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation). In his\ndiscussion of the measurement problem, von Neumann then distinguished\nbetween (i) the system actually observed; (ii) the measuring\ninstrument; and (iii) the actual observer. He argues that during a\nmeasurement the actual observer gets a subjective perception of what\nis going on that has a non-physical nature, which distinguishes it\nfrom the observed object and the measuring instrument. However, he\nholds on to psycho-physical parallelism as a scientific principle,\nwhich he interprets such that there exists a physical correlate to any\nextra-physical process of the subjective experience. So in every case\nwhere we have a subjective perception we must divide the world into\nthe observed system and the observer. But where the division takes\nplace is partly arbitrary.  According von Neumann, it is contextual\nwhether the dividing line is drawn between the description of the\nobserved object (i) and the measuring instrument together with the\nobserver (ii) + (iii), or it is drawn between the description of the\nobserved object together with the measuring instrument, i.e., (i) +\n(ii), and the observer (iii). In other words, von Neumann argues that\nthe observer can never be included in a type 2-process description,\nbut the measuring instrument may sometime be part of a type 2-process,\nalthough it gives the same result with respect to the observed object\n(i). An important consequence of von Neumann\u2019s solution to the\nmeasurement problem is that a type 1-process takes place only in the\npresence of the observer\u2019s consciousness. Furthermore, even when\nvon Neumann considers the situation in which the descriptions of (i)\nand (ii) are combined, he talks about the interaction between the\nphysical system (i) + (ii) and an abstract ego (iii) (Neumann\n1932 [1996], Ch VI).  Therefore, the mind seems to play an active role\nin forming a type 1-process, which would be incompatible with\npsycho-physical parallelism.\n\nIndeed, within philosophy of mind one cannot consistently maintain\nboth psycho-physical parallelism and the existence of an interaction\nbetween the brain and the mind. So it is no wonder that Eugene Wigner\n(1967) followed up on the suggestion of the mind\u2019s interaction\nby proposing that what causes a collapse of the wave function is the\nmind of the observer. But Wigner never explained how it was possible\nfor something mental to produce a material effect like the collapse of\na quantum system. The measuring problem led to the famous paradox of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat and later to the one of Wigner\u2019s\nfriend. Although von Neumann\u2019s and Wigner\u2019s positions are\nusually associated with the Copenhagen Interpretation, such views were\ndefinitely not Bohr\u2019s as we shall see in a moment.\n\nQuantum fundamentalists must indeed be ready to explain why the\nmacroscopic world appears classical. An alternative to von\nNeumann\u2019s projection postulate is the claim that the formalism\nshould be read literally and that measurements (classical outcomes) do\nnot describe the world as it really is. But there are ontological\ncost, which is significant to some. In one interpretation the world\ndivides into as many worlds as there are possible measurement outcomes\neach time a system is observed or interacts with another system. Other\nfundamentalists had hoped that the decoherence program might come up\nwith an appropriate explanation. The decoherence theory sees\nentanglement to exist not only between object and the measurement but\nalso as something which includes the environment. If Bohr had known\nthe idea of decoherence, he would probably have had no objection to\nit, as several authors have pointed to decoherence as a natural\ndynamical extension of his view that measurements is an irreversible\namplification process (Schlosshauer and Camilleri 2015, 2017;\nB\u00e4chtold 2017, Tanona 2017; and Dieks 2017). However, it is\ngenerally agreed that decoherence does not solve the measurement\nproblem (Bacciagaluppi 2016; Zinkernagel 2011). This might seems as if\nvon Neumann\u2019s projection postulate has to be reintroduced as a\ndynamical factor to explain why one and only one measurement result\nappears. However, as Dieks (2017) argues, Bohr\u2019s interpretation\ncould be understood as a non-collapse interpretation, since \u201cthe\nsuperposition does not have an empirical meaning independently of its\ninterpretation via classically described experiments, so no\nreplacement by another mathematical state is needed. We just have to\ninterpret the formulas correctly.\u201d In spite of that there is no\ngeneral agreement to what extent Bohr opposed quantum\nfundamentalism.\n\nTime and again Bohr emphasized that the epistemological distinction\nbetween the instrument and the object is necessary because this is the\nonly way one can functionally make sense of a measurement. The\nepistemic purpose of a measuring instrument is to yield information\nabout an object separated from the instrument itself. It is also\ngenerally agreed that Bohr didn\u2019t treat the classical world of\nthe measuring instrument as epistemically separated from quantum\nobject along the line of a microscopic and macroscopic division. He\nsometimes included parts of the measuring instrument to which the\nquantum mechanical description should be applied. Don Howard (1994)\ntherefore concludes that Bohr was not only an ontological quantum\nfundamentalist but in fact also a sort of an epistemological one. He\nbelieves that one can make Bohr\u2019s requirement that measuring\napparatus and the experimental results have to be described in\nordinary language supplemented with the terminology of classical\nphysics consistent with ontological quantum fundamentalism. According\nto him, Bohr never considered the measuring instrument as a classical\nobject. Moreover, he thinks that this implies that Bohr had to\nunderstand the use of classical concepts differently from what\nscholars usually think. He reinterprets Bohr in terms of quantum\nstates called \u201cmixtures\u201d. Howard believes that with\nrespect to an experimental context in which an instrument interacts\nwith an object, Bohr didn\u2019t understand them as being in an\nentangled state but being separated in a mixture state. The\nconsequence would be that the instrument and the object exist in a\ndefinite quantum state since such a state could be represented as a\nproduct of the wave function for the instrument and for the\nobject.\n\nBut, as Maximilian Schlosshauer and Kristian Camilleri (2008 (Other\nInternet Resources), 2011) have pointed out, this does not solve the\nmeasurement problem. Howard does not explain under which circumstances\none can move from a quantum system-cum-measuring apparatus being in a\nnon-separable state to a mixture of separated states. Therefore one\ncannot be sure that the measuring apparatus is in a definite state and\nits pointer in a definite place. Some philosophers seem to argue that\nBohr was an ontological but not an epistemological quantum\nfundamentalist. For instance, \u201cBohr believed in the fundamental\nand universal nature of quantum mechanics, and saw the classical\ndescription of the apparatus as a purely epistemological move, which\nexpressed the fact that a given quantum system is being used as a\nmeasuring device\u201d (Landsman 2007); and in a similar vein:\n\u201cOne is left with the impression from Bohr\u2019s writings that\nthe quantum-classical divide is a necessary part of the\nepistemological structure of quantum mechanics\u201d (Schlosshauer\nand Camilleri 2008 (Other Internet Resources), 2015). So Klaas\nLandsman (2006, 2007) accepts Howard\u2019s suggestion that Bohr is\nan ontological quantum fundamentalist but he rejects that Bohr should\nbe considered an epistemological quantum fundamentalist. Landsman\nargues that Bohr held that the measuring instrument should be\ndescribed in classical terms since the results of any measurement like\nin classical physics would always have a definite value. However,\nLandsman agrees that Bohr understood all objects as essentially\nquantum mechanical objects.\n\nHowever, it may seem as if both Howard and Landsman miss the pragmatic\nnature of Bohr\u2019s view on ontological issues. Bohr mentioned more\nthan once that physics was not about finding the essence of nature but\nabout describing the phenomena in an unambiguous way. In the\nforeground of Bohr\u2019s thinking was the (1) the need of classical\nconcepts for the description of measuring results; (2)\nnon-separability due to the entanglement of the system and the\nmeasuring instrument; (3) the contextual nature of the measurements of\ncomplementary properties; and (4) the symbolic character of the\nquantum formalism. One has to take all four components into\nconsideration if one wants to understand Bohr\u2019s solution to the\nclassical-quantum problem. According to Bohr, we are in quantum\nmechanics confronted with the \u201cimpossibility of any sharp\nseparation between the behavior of atomic objects and the interaction\nwith the measuring instruments which serve to define the very\nconditions under which the phenomena appear\u201d (APHK, p.\n210). This is definitely a non-classical feature which is described by\nquantum mechanics alone. In his response to the EPR-paper, Bohr\nstrongly rejected that this form of interaction could be regarded as a\nmechanical influence. The influence was on the conditions of\ndescription, i.e. the experimental conditions under which it makes\nsense to apply classical concepts. But during a measurement we need to\nseparate the system from the measuring instrument and the environment\nfor pragmatic reasons. The pragmatic reasons seem to be reasonably\nclear. The outcomes of whatever experiment always yield a definite\nvalue, so the entanglement of object and the measurement instrument\ndescribed by the quantum formalism only lasts until the interaction\nbetween object and instrument stops. The quantum formalism can predict\nthe statistical outcome of these interactions but it cannot say\nanything about the trajectory of objects.\n\nBohr\u2019s firmness about the use of classical concepts for the\ndescriptions of measurement can be seen as his response to the\nmeasurement problem. This problem arises from the fact that quantum\nmechanics itself cannot account for why experiments on objects in a\nstate of superposition always produce a definite outcome. Hence if one\ndoes not argue for spontaneous collapse of the wave function, hidden\nvariables, or many worlds, one needs to supplement quantum mechanics\nwith a classical description of measuring instruments in terms of\nclocks and rods. Henrik Zinkernagel (2015, 2016) may seem to get close\nto Bohr\u2019s view when he argues that Bohr not so much solved the\nmeasuring problem as he dissolved it. According to his interpretation,\nBohr believed in a quantum world, but only relative to a particular\nclassical description and a certain classical world. The distinction\nbetween classical and quantum (both ontic and epistemic) is\ncontextual. He thinks that the measurement problem is ultimately a\nconsequence of ontological quantum fundamentalism (that everything is\nquantum). Because if everything is quantum \u2013 and correctly\ndescribed by quantum formalism (what else would it mean to call\neverything quantum?) \u2013 then a measurement ends up in a\nsuperposition whether we describe the apparatus classical or not. One\ncould say with Zinkernagel that Bohr believed all objects can be\ntreated as quantum objects, but they cannot all be treated as quantum\nobjects at the same time. Borrowing a conception from the two Russian\nphysicists, Landau and Lifshitz, Zinkernagel claims that only some\nparts of the measuring device are entangled with the object in\nquestion, but those parts which are not entangled exists as a\nclassical object. Depending on the context, objects cannot be treated\nas quantum objects in those situations in which they acts as measuring\napparatuses. In these situations the classical treatment of the\nmeasuring device provides us with a frame of reference of space and\ntime with respect to which an atomic object has a position, and,\nmutatis mutandis, with respect to which it has energy and momentum.\nSuch a frame of reference is necessary for our ability to define and\nmeasure a particular property. In Bohr\u2019s own words: \u201cin\neach case [of measurement] some ultimate measuring instruments, like\nthe scales and clocks which determine the frame of space-time\ncoordination on which, in the last resort, even the definitions of\nmomentum and energy quantities rest, must always be described entirely\non classical lines, and consequently kept outside the system subject\nto quantum mechanical treatment\u201d (CC, p. 104). What\ncharacterizes a frame of reference is that it establishes the\nconditions for the ascription of a well-defined position or a\nwell-defined momentum, and treated classically measuring instruments\nact exactly as frames of reference. The implication is that Bohr did\nnot exclude the application of quantum theory to any system. Every\nsystem can in principle be treated quantum mechanically, but since we\nalways need a frame of reference to describe experimental outcomes,\nnot all systems can be treated quantum mechanically at once.\n\nIn this debate Dorato (2017) stresses the fact that by making explicit\nreference to Einstein\u2019s presentation of his special theory of\nrelativity, Bohr regarded quantum mechanics as a theory of principle.\nThis explains both Bohr\u2019s epistemic reliance on the domain of\nclassical physics and his ban of any attempt to construct classical\nobjects from quantum objects. Despite this position Dorato argues that\nin order to justify his entity realism and anti-instrumentalist\ninterpretations, Bohr also needed to postulate something ontologically\ndistinct from the realm of quantum mechanics, a claim that creates the\nwell-known problem of defining in a non-ambiguous and exact way the\ncut between the classical and the quantum realm. By following\nZinkernagel, he claims that this problem is somewhat softened by\nBohr\u2019s contextualist theory of measurement. However,\nBohr\u2019s holism, according to which the measuring device and\nquantum object are in state of entanglement, is in objective tension\nwith Bohr\u2019s thesis of an ontological distinction, especially in\nvirtue of the fact that by referring to the interaction between the\nquantum and the classical system as an irreversible physical process,\nBohr seems to need a constructive approach to quantum mechanics that\nhe wants to avoid.\n\nNonetheless, the question is to what extent Bohr really believed that\nthe classical world is not only epistemically but also ontologically\ndifferent from the quantum world? If he did not make an ontological\ndistinction, there would be no contradiction between his epistemic\nview that the outcome of measurement needs to be described classically\nbut that the apparatus ontologically is just as much a quantum object\nas the object under investigation. So when Bohr regarded quantum\nmechanics as a rational generalization of classical physics, he always\nthought of it as a way to secure the epistemic validity of quantum\nmechanics and not a way to save a classical ontology. Directly\naddressing Zinkernagel\u2019s analysis, Dieks (2017) strongly argues\nthat there can be little doubt that Bohr believed that quantum\nmechanics is universal in the sense that Heisenberg\u2019s\nindeterminacy relation applies to both micro- and macroscopic systems\ndue to the quantum of action. Classical mechanics is a mathematical\napproximation. Moreover, Bohr believed for epistemic reasons that we\nhad to use classical language because this language is a refinement of\nour everyday language, which is adapted to describe our sensory\nexperience and therefore the only language that can endow the quantum\nformalism with an empirical content. Hence, according to Dieks, Bohr\nassumed that it is only an epistemic necessity to describe\n\u201csome systems classically in order to have a pragmatic\nstarting point for the treatment of other systems.\u201d Bohr\u2019s\ndemand of using classical concepts for epistemic reasons has no\nimplications for his view that macroscopic objects are quantum\nobjects. Measuring devices are not classical objects even though we\nneed classical concepts to describe our general physical experiences\nand the outcome of quantum experiments. So Dieks concludes that the\ninteraction between the measuring device and the quantum object\ndetermines, in the classical textbook examples, whether position or\nmomentum talk can be carried over to the quantum object that is\nmeasured. The measuring device itself, if macroscopic and under\nordinary circumstances (so that it really is a measuring device that\ncan be used by us) allows both position and momentum talk in its own\ndescription. The measurement interaction determines which correlations\nare forged with the micro-world.\n10. New Perspectives\n\nAfter the 1950s a number of alternative interpretations to\nBohr\u2019s complementarity were articulated and they all found their\nproponents among physicists and philosophers of science. The\nCopenhagen interpretation started to lose ground to other\ninterpretations such as Bohm\u2019s interpretation, the many worlds\ninterpretation, the modal interpretation and the decoherence\ninterpretation, which have been more in vogue the last couple of\ndecades. But parallel with the growing awareness of the essential\ndifferences between Bohr\u2019s and Heisenberg\u2019s understanding\nof quantum mechanics several philosophers of science have revitalised\nBohr\u2019s view on complementarity. Around the millennium a new\nrecognition of the Copenhagen interpretation has emerged.\n\nRob Clifton and Hans Halvorson (1999, 2002) argue that Bohm\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics can be seen as a special case of\nBohr\u2019s complementarity interpretation if it is assumed that all\nmeasurements ultimately reduce to positions measurement. Originally\nJeffrey Bub and Clifton (1996) were able to demonstrate (given some\nidealized conditions) that Bohr\u2019s complementarity and\nBohm\u2019s mechanics fall under their uniqueness theorem for\nno-collapse interpretations. Clifton and Halvorson improve this result\nby showing that Bohr\u2019s idea of position and momentum\ncomplementarity can be expressed in terms of inequivalent\nrepresentations in the C*-algebraic formalism of quantum mechanics. It\nturns out that either position or momentum are dynamically\nsignificant, but it is not permissible to assume that position and\nmomentum are both dynamically significant in any single context. From\nthese assumptions they conclude that Bohm\u2019s hidden variables are\nnone other than the \u201cvalue states\u201d that the\ncomplementarity interpretation postulates if position measurement were\nalways dynamically significant, but this metaphysical restriction is\nnot, as their results indicate, demanded by the physics. Rather,\nClifton and Halvorson (1999) and Halvorson (2004) believe that\ncomplementarity may give us a realist interpretation of quantum field\ntheory.\n\nPhilosophers have also started to explore the idea of decoherence in\nrelation to Bohr\u2019s view about \u201cthe inseparability of the\nbehavior of the object and the interaction with the measuring\ninstrument\u201d or \u201cthe uncontrollable interaction between the\natomic system and measurement apparatus.\u201d (Schlosshauer and\nCamilleri 2011, 2017; Camilleri and Schlosshauer 2015; B\u00e4chtold\n2017; and Tanona 2017). Although Bohr assumed that the measuring\napparatus is altogether a quantum mechanical system, he nevertheless\nbelieved that the instrument could be approximately described by\nclassical theory. Among the scholars just mentioned there is\na general agreement that the notion of decoherent is coherent with\nBohr\u2019s view about the quantum-classical division and adds a\ndynamical explanation of quantum-to-classical transition which\nBohr\u2019s own exposition lacked. Also attempts to clear up the\nstructural relationship between Bohr\u2019s view and Hugh\nEverett\u2019s \u201crelative state\u201d-interpretation have been\ncarried out; a relationship which at some points is much closer than\nusually thought (Bacciagaluppi 2017).\n\nAnother insight into Bohr\u2019s view of complementarity is due to\nMichael Dickson (2001, 2002). By using the contemporary theory of\nreference frames in quantum theory, he proves that Bohr\u2019s\nresponse to the EPR thought-experiment was in fact the correct one.\nMoreover, he also maintains that Bohr\u2019s discussions of spin, a\nproperty much less frame dependent than position and momentum, were\nvery different from his discussions of the latter, and based on these\ndifferences he offers a Bohrian account of Bell\u2019s theorem and\nits significance.\n\nA re-assessment of Bohr\u2019s philosophy of quantum mechanics is\nmade by Whitaker (2004) on the basis of Clifton and Halvorson\u2019s\nand Dickson\u2019s works and in the light of quantum information\ntheory. Besides these attempts to apply Bohr\u2019s notion of\ncomplementarity to the contemporary discussions of the interpretation\nof quantum mechanics and quantum field theory there is an ongoing\nattempt to understand Bohr\u2019s idea of symbolic representation\n(Tanona, 2004a, 2004b) and his notion of complementarity with respect\nto trends in post-modern philosophy and general epistemology such as\npoststructuralism, deconstructivism, feminism and cultural studies\n(Honner 1994; Plotnitsky 1994; Barad 2007; and Katsumori 2011).\n",
