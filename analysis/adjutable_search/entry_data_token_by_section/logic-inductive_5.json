The Application of Inductive Probabilities to the Evaluation of Scientific Hypotheses\n\nOne of the most important applications of an inductive logic is its treatment of\nthe evidential evaluation of scientific hypotheses.\nThe logic should capture the structure of evidential support for all\nsorts of scientific hypotheses, ranging from simple diagnostic claims (e.g.,\n\u201cthe patient is infected by the HIV\u201d) to complex scientific theories about the fundamental nature of the world, such as quantum\nmechanics or the theory of relativity. This section will show how\nevidential support functions (a.k.a. Bayesian confirmation functions)\nrepresent the evidential evaluation of scientific hypotheses and theories. This logic is essentially comparative. The evaluation of a hypothesis depends on how strongly evidence supports it over alternative hypotheses.\n\nConsider some collection of mutually incompatible, alternative hypotheses (or theories)\nabout a common subject matter, \\(\\{h_1, h_2 , \\ldots \\}\\). The collection of\nalternatives may be very simple, e.g., {\u201cthe patient has\nHIV\u201d, \u201cthe patient is free of HIV\u201d}. Or, when the\nphysician is trying to determine which among a range of diseases is\ncausing the patient\u2019s symptoms, the collection of alternatives may\nconsist of a long list of possible disease hypotheses. For the cosmologist, the collection of alternatives may consist of several distinct gravitational\ntheories, or several empirically distinct variants of the \u201csame\u201d theory. Whenever two variants of a hypothesis (or theory) differ in empirical import, they count as distinct hypotheses. (This should not be confused with the converse positivistic assertion that theories with the same empirical content are really the same theory. Inductive logic\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily endorse that view.)\n\nThe collection of competing hypotheses (or theories) to be evaluated by the logic may be finite in number, or may be countably infinite. No realistic language contains more than a countable number of expressions; so it suffices for a logic to apply to countably infinite number of sentences. From a purely logical perspective the collection of competing alternatives may consist of every rival hypothesis (or theory) about a given subject matter that can be expressed within a given language \u2014 e.g., all possible theories of the origin and evolution of the universe expressible in English and contemporary mathematics. In practice, alternative hypotheses (or theories) will often be constructed and evidentially evaluated over a long period of time. The logic of evidential support works in much the same way regardless of whether all alternative hypotheses are considered together, or only a few alternative hypotheses are available at a time.\n\nEvidence for scientific hypotheses consists of the results of specific\nexperiments or observations. For a given experiment or observation,\nlet \u2018\\(c\\)\u2019 represent a description of the relevant conditions under which it is performed, and let\n\u2018\\(e\\)\u2019 represent a description of the result of the experiment or observation, the evidential outcome of \nconditions \\(c\\).\n\nThe logical connection between scientific hypotheses and the evidence often requires the mediation of background information and auxiliary hypotheses. Let \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 represent whatever background and auxiliary hypotheses are required to connect each hypothesis \\(h_i\\) among the competing hypotheses \\(\\{h_1, h_2 , \\ldots \\}\\) to the evidence. Although the claims expressed by the auxiliary hypotheses within \\(b\\) may themselves be subject to empirical evaluation, they should be the kinds of claims that\nare not at issue in the evaluation of the alternative hypothesis in the collection\n\\(\\{h_1, h_2 , \\ldots \\}\\). Rather, each of the alternative hypotheses under consideration draws on the same background and auxiliaries to\nlogically connect to the evidential events. (If competing hypotheses \\(h_i\\) and\n\\(h_j\\) draw on distinct auxiliary hypotheses \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\),\nrespectively, in making logical contact with evidential claims, then\nthe following treatment should be applied to the respective\nconjunctive hypotheses, \\((h_{i}\\cdot a_{i})\\) and \\((h_{j}\\cdot\na_{j})\\), since these alternative conjunctive hypotheses will\nconstitute the empirically distinct alternatives at issue.) \n\nIn cases where a hypothesis is deductively related to an\noutcome \\(e\\) of an observational or experimental condition\n\\(c\\) (via background and auxiliaries \\(b\\)), we will have\neither \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c \\vDash\ne\\) or \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c\n\\vDash{\\nsim}e\\). For example, \\(h_i\\) might be the Newtonian\nTheory of Gravitation. A test of the theory might involve a condition\nstatement \\(c\\) that describes the results of some earlier measurements\nof Jupiter\u2019s position, and that describes the means by which the\nnext position measurement will be made; the outcome description\n\\(e\\) states the result of this additional position measurement;\nand the background information (and auxiliary hypotheses) \\(b\\)\nmight state some already well confirmed theory about the workings and\naccuracy of the devices used to make the position measurements. Then,\nfrom \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c\\) we may calculate the specific outcome\n\\(e\\) we expect to find; thus, the following logical entailment\nholds: \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c \\vDash\ne\\). Then, provided that the experimental and observational\nconditions stated by \\(c\\) are in fact true, if the evidential\noutcome described by \\(e\\) actually occurs, the resulting conjoint\nevidential claim \\((c\\cdot e)\\) may be considered good evidence for\n\\(h_i\\), given \\(b\\). (This method of theory evaluation is called the\nhypothetical-deductive approach to evidential support.) On\nthe other hand, when from \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c\\) we calculate some\noutcome incompatible with the observed evidential outcome \\(e\\),\nthen the following logical entailment holds: \\(h_i\\cdot\nb\\cdot c \\vDash{\\nsim}e\\). In that case, from deductive logic alone we\nmust also have that \\(b\\cdot c\\cdot e\n\\vDash{\\nsim}h_i\\); thus, \\(h_i\\) is said to be\nfalsified by \\(b\\cdot c\\cdot e\\). The Bayesian account of\nevidential support we will be describing below extends this\ndeductivist approach to include cases where the hypothesis \\(h_i\\)\n(and its alternatives) may not be deductive related to the evidence,\nbut may instead imply that the evidential outcome is likely or unlikely\nto some specific degree r. That is, the Bayesian approach applies to cases where we may have neither \\(h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c\n\\vDash e\\) nor \\(h_i\\cdot\nb\\cdot c \\vDash{\\nsim}e\\), but may instead only have \\(P[e\n\\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c] = r\\), where r is some\n\u201centailment strength\u201d between 0 and 1. \n\nBefore going on to describing the logic of evidential support in more\ndetail, perhaps a few more words are in order about the background knowledge\nand auxiliary hypotheses, represented here by \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019.\nDuhem (1906) and Quine (1953) are generally credited with alerting\ninductive logicians to the importance of auxiliary hypotheses in\nconnecting scientific hypotheses and theories to empirical evidence.\n(See the entry on\n Pierre Duhem.)\n They point out that scientific hypotheses often make little contact\nwith evidence claims on their own. Rather, in most cases scientific hypotheses\nmake testable predictions only relative to background information and\nauxiliary hypotheses that tie them to the evidence. (Some specific examples of such auxiliary hypotheses will be provided in the next subsection.) Typically\nauxiliaries are highly confirmed hypotheses from other scientific\ndomains. They often describe the operating characteristics of various\ndevices (e.g., measuring instruments) used to make observations or\nconduct experiments. Their credibility is usually not at issue in the testing of hypothesis \\(h_i\\) against its competitors, because \\(h_i\\) and its alternatives\nusually rely on the same auxiliary hypotheses to tie them to the\nevidence. But even when an auxiliary hypothesis is already\nwell-confirmed, we cannot simply assume that it is unproblematic, or\njust known to be true. Rather, the evidential support or\nrefutation of a hypothesis \\(h_i\\) is relative to whatever\nauxiliaries and background information (in \\(b\\)) is being\nsupposed in the confirmational context. In other contexts the auxiliary hypotheses used to test \\(h_i\\) may themselves be among a collection of alternative hypotheses\nthat are subject to evidential support or refutation. Furthermore, to\nthe extent that competing hypotheses employ different auxiliary\nhypotheses in accounting for evidence, the evidence only tests each\nsuch hypothesis in conjunction with its distinct auxiliaries against\nalternative hypotheses packaged with their distinct auxiliaries, as\ndescribed earlier. Thus, what counts as a hypothesis to be\ntested, \\(h_i\\), and what counts as auxiliary hypotheses and\nbackground information, \\(b\\), may depend on the epistemic context\u2014on what class of alternative hypotheses are being tested by a collection of experiments or observations, and on what claims are presupposed in that context.\nNo statement is intrinsically a test hypothesis, or\nintrinsically an auxiliary hypothesis or background condition. Rather, these categories are roles statements may play in a particular epistemic context.\n\nIn a probabilistic inductive logic the degree to which the evidence\n\\((c\\cdot e)\\) supports a hypothesis \\(h_i\\) relative to background and auxiliaries\n\\(b\\) is represented by the posterior probability of\n\\(h_i\\), \\(P_{\\alpha}[h_i \\pmid b\\cdot c\\cdot e]\\), according to an evidential\nsupport function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\). It turns out that the posterior\nprobability of a hypothesis depends on just two kinds of factors:\n(1) its prior probability, \\(P_{\\alpha}[h_i \\pmid b]\\),\ntogether with the prior probabilities of its competitors,\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[h_j \\pmid b]\\), \\(P_{\\alpha}[h_k \\pmid b]\\), etc.; and (2) the likelihood of evidential outcomes \\(e\\) according to \\(h_i\\) in conjunction with with \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), \\(P[e \\pmid h_i\\cdot b\\cdot c]\\), together with\nthe likelihoods of these same evidential outcomes according to competing hypotheses, \\(P[e\n\\pmid h_j\\cdot b\\cdot c]\\), \\(P[e \\pmid h_k\\cdot b\\cdot c]\\), etc. We will now examine each of these factors in some detail. Following that we will see precisely how the values of posterior probabilities depend on the values of likelihoods\nand prior probabilities.\n",
