    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || Avoiding Inflationary Metaphysics\n2.6 Avoiding Inflationary Metaphysics\n\nWe can see in the above discussion of the pragmatics of explanation\nwhy the constructive empiricist thinks constructive empiricism can\nhelp us to make sense of science \u201cwithout inflationary\nmetaphysics\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 73). By \u201cinflationary\nmetaphysics,\u201d van Fraassen has in mind the scientific\nrealists\u2019 typical beliefs in, for example, laws of nature,\nnatural kinds, and objective modality.\n\nThe constructive empiricist recognizes that believing in empirical\nadequacy involves sticking our necks out, just as believing in truth\ndoes; nonetheless,\n\n\u2026 there is a difference: the assertion of empirical adequacy is\na great deal weaker than the assertion of truth, and the restraint to\nacceptance delivers us from metaphysics. (van Fraassen 1980, 69)\n\n\nScientific realists might not be moved by this consideration, because\nthey might not see any problem with inflationary metaphysics. The\npoint of The Scientific Image, according to van Fraassen, was\nto answer the question: what should an empiricist think about science?\nSince an empiricist would want to avoid inflationary metaphysics, this\nconsideration would move them to favor constructive empiricism. The\nquestion of why one would want to be an empiricist is taken up in van\nFraassen\u2019s 2002 book, The Empirical Stance.\n",
