    "main_text": "Alternative Conceptions of Justification || Formal Learning Theory\n5.4 Formal Learning Theory\n\nFormal learning theory can be regarded as a kind of extension of the\nReichenbachian programme. It does not offer justifications for\ninductive inferences in the sense of giving reasons why they should be\ntaken as likely to provide a true conclusion. Rather it offers a\n\u201cmeans-ends\u201d epistemology -- it provides reasons for\nfollowing particular methods based on their optimality in achieving\ncertain desirable epistemic ends, even if there is no guarantee that\nat any given stage of inquiry the results they produce are at all\nclose to the truth (Schulte 1999).\n\nFormal learning theory is particularly concerned with showing that\nmethods are \u201clogically reliable\u201d in the sense that they\narrive at the truth given any sequence of data consistent with our\nbackground knowledge (Kelly 1996). However, it goes further than this.\nAs we have just seen, one of the problems for Reichenbach was that\nthere are too many rules which converge in the limit to the true\nfrequency. Which one should we then choose in the short-run? Formal\nlearning theory broadens Reichenbach\u2019s general strategy by\nconsidering what happens if we have other epistemic goals besides\nlong-run convergence to the truth. In particular, formal learning\ntheorists have considered the goal of getting to the truth as\nefficiently, or quickly, as possible, as well as the goal of\nminimising the number of mind-changes, or retractions along the way.\nIt has then been argued that the usual inductive method, which is\ncharacterised by a preference for simpler hypotheses (Occam\u2019s\nrazor), can be justified since it is the unique method which meets the\nstandards for getting to the truth in the long run as efficiently as\npossible, with a minimum number of retractions (Kelly 2007).\n\nSteel (2010) has proposed that the Principle of Induction (understood\nas a rule which makes inductive generalisations along the lines of the\nStraight Rule) can be given a means-ends justification by showing that\nfollowing it is both necessary and sufficient for logical reliability.\nThe proof is an a priori mathematical one, thus it allegedly avoids\nthe circularity of Hume\u2019s second horn. However, Steel also does\nnot see the approach as an attempt to grasp Hume\u2019s first horn,\nsince the proof is only relative to a certain choice of epistemic\nends.\n\nAs with other results in formal learning theory, this solution is also\nonly valid relative to a given hypothesis space and conception of\npossible sequences of data. For this reason, some have seen it as not\naddressing Hume\u2019s problem of giving grounds for a particular\ninductive inference (Howson 2011). An alternative attitude is that it\ndoes solve a significant part of Hume\u2019s problem (Steel 2010).\nThere is a similar dispute over formal learning theory\u2019s\ntreatment of Goodman\u2019s riddle (Chart 2000, Schulte 2017).\n",
