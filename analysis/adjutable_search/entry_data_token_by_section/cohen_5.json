    "main_text": "Ethics, Jurisprudence, and the Laws of Human Action\n6. Ethics, Jurisprudence, and the Laws of Human Action\n\nCohen did not restrict his use of the transcendental method to\nepistemology and philosophy of science. As Sebastian Luft argues,\n\u201cthe exact sciences are his point of departure, but they are not\nthe only object of critique\u201d (Luft 2015, 58). For Cohen, the\ntranscendental method must be applied to ethics as well. He thus\nsought to extend its application beyond a treatment of the laws of\nnature to the laws of human action. He ultimately argued that the\nresult of this application was a Kantian ethical justification for\ndemocratic socialism.\n\nCohen\u2019s first attempt to apply the transcendental method to\nethics was his Kant\u2019s Foundations of Ethics, which\nfirst appeared in 1877. In it, he is motivated by a dissatisfaction\nthat Kant could not provide a transcendental deduction of the moral\nlaw the way he had for the categories in the first Critique\n(Cohen 1877, 179). In the first Critique, Kant had argued\nthat the categories are justified, because they are necessary\nconditions for the possibility of experience. But in the Critique\nof Practical Reason, he argued that the moral law cannot be\njustified as a necessary condition of experience, because we can\nexperience ourselves only as beings whose actions have natural causes,\nand cannot experience ourselves as free moral agents. Thus, Kant\ninsisted, the moral law must be the sole \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d\u2014a fact that has no, but needs no, justification\nbeyond the force with which it impresses itself on us (Kant 1999\n[1788], 5:31, 5:47\u20138). Cohen thinks this was an inadequate\njustification of the moral law. He attempts to show that an improved\njustification results from transcendental reflection on the idea of a\npure will, that is, the idea of a will that is not conditioned by any\nantecedent causes and is therefore free. With Kant, he argues that\nsuch a will is possible only on the condition that the moral law\napplies to it. But unlike Kant, he does not assert the actuality of a\npure, free will. Rather, he argues that freedom of the will is itself\na regulative ideal, an end at which we aim our actions (Cohen 1877,\n199\u2013201ff.).\n\nHowever, Cohen did not remain satisfied with this account of the\nfoundations of the moral law, nor with his early view of how the\ntranscendental method applies in the domain of ethics. In his 1904\nEthics of Pure Will, the second part of his System of\nPhilosophy, he offers a significantly revised account of both.\nHere, Cohen\u2019s account is shaped by two commitments. First, he\nasserts that the subject matter of ethics is humanity, that is, human\nmoral agency (Cohen 1902, 3). He thinks the aim of ethics is to\nconstruct a normative theory of the human moral agent and its will.\nSecond, unlike in his earlier Kant\u2019s Foundations of\nEthics, Cohen now takes seriously the requirement that the\ntranscendental method begins with a fact of science. For Cohen, just\nas epistemology and philosophy of science must begin by accepting the\ntheories of pure natural science as given, ethics according to the\ntranscendental method must begin with a science of humanity.\n\nCohen canvasses three possibilities for such a science of humanity.\nEthics might start with a Fichtean \u201cscience\u201d of the\nsubject. But Cohen rejects this possibility as a lapse back into\npre-critical speculation (Cohen 1902, 13ff.). Alternatively, ethics\nmight start with naturalistic human sciences such as psychology. But,\nCohen objects, making these sciences the starting point for ethical\nreflection would violate Kant\u2019s insistence that ethics\ndistinguishes between normative and non-normative considerations,\nbetween what Cohen calls Being and the Ought (Cohen 1902, 9ff.).\n\nThus Cohen argues that ethics begins with the science of\njurisprudence, that is, the science that investigates law and human\nbeings considered precisely as agents whose actions are bound by\nlaw\u2019s normative constraints (Cohen 1902, 66ff.). Cohen does not\nhave in mind a jurisprudence that is concerned only with positive law.\nRather, the transcendental method in ethics begins with pure\njurisprudence, which investigates the very concept of law and its\nessential features such as universality. Pure jurisprudence is thus\nthe science of universal laws of human action. (Pure jurisprudence in\nthis sense was one topic of German legal theory around the turn of the\ntwentieth century. Rudolf Stammler\u2019s 1902 The Theory of\nJustice is representative.) For Cohen, this evolving body of pure\nlegal doctrine constitutes a fact of science. Ethics according to the\ntranscendental method accepts it as given. Then, by reflecting on this\nevolving body of legal doctrine, ethics seeks to construct a theory of\nthe human being as a moral agent (Schwarzschild 1975).\n\nPure jurisprudence guides ethics in constructing a theory of humanity\nby overcoming a problem that, Cohen thinks, any theory of humanity\nfaces. He claims the concept of humanity has a tension contained in\nit: a human being is at once an individual and a member of various\npluralities, such as religious communities or economic collectives\n(Cohen 1902, 3ff). Further, the wills of pluralities of individuals do\nnot necessarily cohere: individuals do not necessarily will things\nthat are consistent with what other individuals will, or with what the\ncommunity as a whole wills. But, Cohen suggests, without an account of\nwhat an individual may will consistently with the wills of others, we\nhave no coherent account of the moral agent as both an individual and\na member of a plurality. Thus any theory of humanity requires an\naccount of how to reconcile individuals\u2019 wills within a\nplurality. As Cohen puts it, individuals\u2019 wills must be unified\ninto a totality. Or, in somewhat less opaque language, we must\nunderstand how the universal laws of an ideal state can reconcile the\nwills of individuals and pluralities (Wiedebach 1997, Pt. 3). Further,\naccording to Cohen, if we want to think systematically about what\nthose universal laws are, we must start by reflecting on the evolving\nbody of legal doctrine provided by pure jurisprudence\u2014the\nscience of universal laws. For Cohen, the doctrines of pure\njurisprudence to do evolve arbitrarily: they evolve in an unending\nprocess of demanding and giving reasons. Paul Nahme thus claims that\n\u201c[w]e can therefore describe Cohen\u2019s account of the\nethical will as a logic of public reasoning...\u201d(Nahme 2019,\n268).\n\nCohen\u2019s emphasis on the universal character of ethical laws is\nclearly Kantian in spirit, and he certainly intends the universal laws\nof an ideal state to be the laws people must give to themselves in\nKant\u2019s realm of ends. But still, it is not obvious how exactly\nto characterize the relation of Cohen\u2019s ethics to Kant\u2019s.\nOn one plausible reading of Kant, a general theory of the moral will\nwas the basis for his theory of law in the Doctrine of Right. But on\nCohen\u2019s view of how to apply the transcendental method to\nethics, ethics begins with a theory of law from pure jurisprudence and\nthen, by reflecting on pure law, it seeks to construct a general\ntheory of the moral agent and its will. Thus Cohen\u2019s account of\nthe foundations of ethics might differ fundamentally from\nKant\u2019s\u2014indeed, it might turn Kant\u2019s account on its\nhead.\n",
