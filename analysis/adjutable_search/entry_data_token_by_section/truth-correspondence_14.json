    "main_text": "The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors || Pluralism\n8.2 Pluralism\n\n\nThe correspondence theory is sometimes accused of overreaching itself:\nit does apply, so the objection goes, to truths from some domains of\ndiscourse, e.g., scientific discourse and/or discourse about everyday\nmidsized physical things, but not to truths from various other domains\nof discourse, e.g., ethical and/or aesthetic discourse (see the first\nobjection in Section 5 above). Alethic pluralism grows out of\nthis objection, maintaining that truth is constituted by\ndifferent properties for true propositions from different domains of\ndiscourse: by correspondence to fact for true propositions from the\ndomain of scientific or everyday discourse about physical things; by\nsome epistemic property, such as coherence or superassertibility, for\ntrue propositions from the domain of ethical and aesthetic discourse,\nand maybe by still other properties for other domains of\ndiscourse. This suggests a position on which the term\n\u201ctrue\u201d is multiply ambiguous, expressing different\nproperties when applied to propositions from different\ndomains. However, contemporary pluralists reject this problematic\nidea, maintaining instead that truth is \u201cmultiply\nrealizable\u201d. That is, the term \u201ctrue\u201d is univocal,\nit expresses one concept or property, truth (being true), but one that\ncan be realized by or manifested in different\nproperties (correspondence to fact, coherence or superassertibility,\nand maybe others) for true propositions from different domains of\ndiscourse. Truth itself is not to be identified with any of its\nrealizing properties. Instead, it is characterized, quasi\naxiomatically, by a set of alleged \u201cplatitudes\u201d,\nincluding, according to Crispin Wright\u2019s (1999) version,\n\u201ctransparency\u201d (to assert is to present as true),\n\u201ccontrast\u201d (a proposition may be true without being\njustified, and v.v.), \u201ctimelesness\u201d (if a proposition is\never true, then it always is), \u201cabsoluteness\u201d (there is no\nsuch thing as a proposition being more or less true), and others.\nThough it contains the correspondence theory as one ingredient,\nalethic pluralism is nevertheless a genuine competitor, for it rejects\nthe thesis that truth is correspondence to reality. Moreover,\nit equally contains competitors of the correspondence theory as\nfurther ingredients.\n\n\nAlethic pluralism in its contemporary form is a relatively young\nposition. It was inaugurated by Crispin Wright (1992; see also 1999)\nand was later developed into a somewhat different form by Lynch\n(2009). Critical discussion is still at a relatively nascent stage\n(but see Vision 2004, chap. 4, for extended discussion of Wright). It\nwill likely focus on two main problem areas.\n\nFirst, it seems difficult to sort propositions into distinct\nkinds according to the subject matter they are about. Take, e.g., the\nproposition that killing is morally wrong, or the proposition that\nimmoral acts happen in space-time. What are they about? Intuitively,\ntheir subject matter is mixed, belonging to the physical domain, the\nbiological domain, and the domain of ethical discourse. It is hard to\nsee how pluralism can account for the truth of such mixed\npropositions, belonging to more than one domain of discourse: What\nwill be the realizing property?\n\nSecond, pluralists are expected to explain how the platitudes\ncan be \u201cconverted\u201d into an account of truth itself. Lynch\n(2009) proposes to construe truth as a functional property,\ndefined in terms of a complex functional role which is given\nby the conjunction of the platitudes (somewhat analogous to the way in\nwhich functionalists in the philosophy of mind construe mental states\nas functional states, specified in terms of their functional\nroles\u2014though in their case the relevant functional roles are\ncausal roles, which is not a feasible option when it comes to the\ntruth-role). Here the main issue will be to determine (a)\nwhether such an account really works, when the technical details are\nlaid out, and (b) whether it is plausible to claim that\nproperties as different as correspondence to a fact, on the one hand,\nand coherence or superassertibilty, on the other, can be said to play\none and the same role\u2014a claim that seems required by the thesis\nthat these different properties all realize the same property, being\ntrue.\n\n\nFor more on pluralism, see e.g. the essays in Monnoyer (2007) and in\nPedersen & Wright (2013); and the entry on\n pluralist theories of truth \n in this encyclopedia.\n",
