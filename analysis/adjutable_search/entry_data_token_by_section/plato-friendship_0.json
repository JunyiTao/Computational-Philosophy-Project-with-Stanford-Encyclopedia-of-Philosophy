    "main_text": "Socrates and the Art of Love\n1. Socrates and the Art of Love\n\n\u201cThe only thing I say I know,\u201d Socrates tells us in the\nSymposium, \u201cis the art of love\u201d (ta\ner\u00f4tika) (177d8\u20139). Taken literally, it is an\nincredible claim. Are we really to believe that the man who affirms\nwhen on trial for his life that he knows himself to be wise \u201cin\nneither a great nor a small way\u201d (Apology 21b4\u20135)\nknows the art of love? In fact, the claim is a nontrivial play on\nwords facilitated by the fact that the noun er\u00f4s\n(\u201clove\u201d) and the verb er\u00f4tan (\u201cto ask\nquestions\u201d) sound as if they are etymologically\nconnected\u2014a connection explicitly exploited in the\nCratylus (398c5-e5). Socrates knows about the art of love in\nthat\u2014but just insofar as\u2014he knows how to ask questions,\nhow to converse elenctically.\n\nJust how far that is, we discover in the Lysis, where\nSocrates makes a similar claim. Hippothales, like Socrates, loves\nbeautiful boys and philosophical discussions (203b6\u2013204a3). But\nhe does not know the art of love and so does not know how to talk to\nLysis\u2014the boy with whom he is in love. What Hippothales does is\nsing eulogies to Lysis, and that, Socrates argues, no skilled\nlover would ever do. For if your suit succeeds \u201ceverything\nyou\u2019ve said and sung turns out to eulogize yourself as victor in\nhaving won such a boyfriend,\u201d but if it fails, then \u201cthe\ngreater your praise of his beauty and goodness, the more you will seem\nto have lost and the more you will be ridiculed.\u201d Consequently,\nsomeone \u201cwho is wise in the art of love (ta\ner\u00f4tika) doesn\u2019t praise his beloved until he has him:\nhe fears how the future may turn out\u201d (205e2\u2013206a2).\nConvinced, Hippothales asks Socrates to tell him \u201cwhat someone\nshould say or do to get his prospective boyfriend to love him?\u201d\n(206c1\u20133). As in the Symposium, Socrates is\nuncharacteristically forthcoming: \u201cif you\u2019re willing to\nhave him talk with me, I might be able to give you a demonstration of\nhow to carry on a discussion with him\u201d (c4\u20136). What\nfollows is an elenctic examination of Lysis. Socrates\u2019 lessons\nin love, we may infer, are elenctic lessons\u2014lessons in how to\nask and answer questions.\n\nAt the end of the examination, Socrates characterizes what he has\naccomplished: \u201cThis is how you should talk to your boyfriends,\nHippothales, making them humble and drawing in their sails, instead of\nswelling them up and spoiling them, as you do\u201d (210e2\u20135).\nIt sounds simply chastening put like that. But in the overall context\nof the Lysis, where love is a desire and desire is an\nemptiness, it is much more. It is a step in the creation of the\ncanonical lover\u2014the philosopher:\n\nThose who are already wise no longer love wisdom\n(philosophein), whether they are gods or men. Neither do\nthose who are so ignorant that they are bad, for no bad and stupid\nperson loves wisdom. There remains only those who have this bad thing,\nignorance, but have not yet been made ignorant and stupid by it. They\nare conscious of not knowing what they don\u2019t know.\n(218a2-b1)\n\nSo by showing Lysis that he isn\u2019t already wise, by getting him\nto recognize that he doesn\u2019t know, Socrates sets him on the road\nto philosophy (cf. Sophist 231b3\u20138).\n\nThe elenchus is important to love, then, because it creates a hunger\nfor wisdom\u2014a hunger which it cannot itself assuage. So even\nthough Lysis is already something of a philosopher when he meets\nSocrates and receives a rare accolade from him\u2014\u201cI was\npleased with his love of wisdom (philosophia)\u201d\n(213d6)\u2014he, too, is left in puzzlement (aporia). He is\nmade aware of his desire by Socrates but the desire itself remains\nunsatisfied. Socrates may be the master of foreplay, of arousing\ndesire, and may to that extent be a master of the art of love, but\nwhen it comes to satisfying desire, he is a failure.\n\nThe connection\u2014amounting to an identification\u2014between the\nart of discussion and the art of loving boys explored in the\nLysis allows us to see why Plato\u2019s own explorations of\nlove invariably involve an exploration of discussion\ntoo\u2014love-talk in the Lysis, symposiastic speech-making\nand drama in the Symposium, oratory and rhetoric in the\nPhaedrus. Loving boys correctly, after all, is\u2014in part\nat least\u2014just a matter of knowing how to talk to them, of how to\npersuade them to love you back.\n",
