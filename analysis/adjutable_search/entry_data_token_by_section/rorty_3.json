    "main_text": "Against Epistemology || Antirepresentationalism\n2.2 Antirepresentationalism\n\nRorty\u2019s enduring attitude to relativism and subjectivism is that\nboth are products of the representationalist paradigm. Though the\ntheme is explicit in PMN and CP (\u201cPragmatism, Relativism,\nIrrationalism\u201d), it is with Rorty\u2019s later and further\nappropriation of Davidson that his criticism of the idea of knowledge\nas representation becomes fully elaborated (ORT,\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d and Part II). Drawing on Davidson\u2019s\ncriticism of the scheme-content distinction (\u201cOn the Very Idea\nof a Conceptual Scheme\u201d) and of the correspondence theory of\ntruth (\u201cThe Structure and Content of Truth\u201d), Rorty is\nable to back up his rejection of any philosophical position or project\nwhich attempts to draw a general line between what is made and what is\nfound, what is subjective and what is objective, what is mere\nappearance and what is real. Rorty\u2019s position is not that these\nconceptual contrasts never have application, but that such application\nis always context and interest bound and that there is, as in the case\nof the related notion of truth, nothing to be said about them in\ngeneral. Rorty\u2019s commitment to the conversationalist view of\nknowledge must therefore be distinguished from subjectivism or\nrelativism, which, Rorty argues, presuppose the very distinctions he\nseeks to reject. Equally, Rorty\u2019s epistemological behaviorism\nmust not be confused with an idealism that asserts a primacy of\nthought or language with respect to the unmediated world, since this,\ntoo, is a position that is undercut by Rorty\u2019s Davidsonian\nposition. In light of the view of truth and of meaning that Rorty\nappropriates from Davidson, his conversationalism is not a matter of\ngiving priority to the subjective over the objective, or to\nmind\u2019s power over world\u2019s constraint. Rather it is the\nother side of his anti-representationalism, which denies that we are\nrelated to the world in anything other than causal terms. Differently\nput, Rorty argues that we can give no useful content to the notion\nthat the world, by its very nature, rationally constrains choices of\nvocabulary with which to cope with it (TP, \u201cThe Very Idea of\nHuman Answerability to the World: John McDowell\u2019s Version of\nEmpiricism\u201d). \ufeffThis has implications for Rorty\u2019s\nview of the contribution of philosophy to intellectual progress:\n\u201cwhat matters in the end are changes in the vocabulary rather\nthan changes in belief, changes in truth-value candidates rather than\nassignments of truth-value\u201d (CIS, 47\u201348). As Rorty reads\nphilosophy, its significant achievements are not discoveries of the\ntruth or falsehood of certain propositions, but innovations in our\ndescriptive capacities \u2013 changes in what we are able to say and\nthink.\n",
