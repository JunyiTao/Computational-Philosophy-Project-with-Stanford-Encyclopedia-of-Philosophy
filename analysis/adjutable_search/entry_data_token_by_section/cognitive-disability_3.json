    "main_text": "Individually-Based Accounts\n3. Individually-Based Accounts\n\nIndividually-based accounts generally take cognitively normal adult\nhuman beings as their paradigm and pick out one or more of their\nattributes as sufficient for the moral status they\n enjoy.[4]\n These accounts identify overlapping clusters of psychological and\ncognitive attributes\u2014self-consciousness, awareness of and\nconcern for oneself as a temporally-extended subject; practical\nrationality, rational agency, or autonomy; moral responsibility; a\ncapacity to recognize other selves and to be motivated to justify\none\u2019s actions to them; the capacity to be held, and hold others,\nmorally accountable. These attributes pick out different subsets of\nhuman beings. Some self-conscious humans, for example, may lack the\ncapacity to be held morally accountable. But individually-based\naccounts may differ less in the range of beings to whom they accord\nfull moral status than in the ways they regard those attributes as\ngrounding that status.\n\nOne approach holds that psychological attributes confer moral status\nby virtue of the interests to which they give rise. This approach\ntreats psychological attributes as the basis of interests that we have\na prima facie obligation to advance, or at least not to\nthwart\u2014an obligation whose strength varies with the strength and\nother features of those interests. The capacity to feel pain grounds\nan obligation to avoid its infliction; the capacity to anticipate and\ndread as well as feel pain may ground a stronger obligation. But if\nadditional psychological capacities merely increased the strength of\nthe interest, and the corresponding obligation to advance or not\nthwart it, an interest account would not provide a basis for a moral\nstatus threshold (McMahan 2002).\n\nAn account that accorded interests moral weight in proportion to their\nstrength would not require a notion of moral status, even if beings of\na particular type tended to have stronger interests. Thus,\nphilosophers who account for our differing obligations to beings of\ndifferent species in terms of their unequal interests tend to regard\n\u201cmoral status\u201d as an unnecessary or inert notion (Harman,\n2003, 187), or to conclude that all beings with interests (for which\nsentience is often thought necessary) have equal moral status (Rossi,\n2010). This denial of different levels of moral status, however,\nlicenses the unequal treatment of human beings with the most severe\ncognitive impairments if they are assumed to have weaker interests,\nespecially in survival. Thus, it offers cold comfort to defenders of\nthe moral equality of all human beings.\n\nMore categorical interest-based approaches ground moral status in the\ncapacity to experience oneself as a temporally-extended being whose\nlife can go better or worse (Singer 1993; Tooley 1983) or to value\none\u2019s own existence (Harris 1985; Newson 2007). Individuals\nhaving such capacities can care about and value their future lives in\nways that individuals lacking those capacities cannot, giving them a\nqualitatively weightier interest in those lives (McMahan 2002).\nWhether or not such capacities can account for the threshold and range\nfeatures of full moral status, their adoption as criteria appears to\ndeny that status to human beings with the most significant cognitive\nimpairments.\n\nA second approach, derived from or inspired by Kant, sees moral status\nin terms of the respect demanded by the possession of one or more\nattributes, such as autonomy or moral responsibility (e.g., Korsgaard\n1996). This approach regards the possession of an autonomous will as\nconferring dignity and demanding respect, so that a being with such a\nwill must not be treated as a mere means, but as an end. This Kantian\nconception of full moral status is often regarded as a paradigm, in\nidentifying an attribute that does not vary\n continuously,[5]\n and whose possession appears to have clear moral implications. The\nthreshold for moral status set by many Kantian accounts is a high one.\nIf those accounts regard the capacity for autonomy as the threshold\nfor full moral status, and if they understand that capacity as\ngrounding moral status in moral responsibility, then since\n\u201cthere is nothing for which we would hold human infants or\nseverely cognitively disabled adults morally responsible, it is\nargued, such humans must lack Kantian moral status\u201d (Kain 2009,\n 66).[6]\n Even if humans need not be held morally responsible to enjoy full\nmoral status, many would still lack the capacity for autonomy that\nseems essential on any Kantian account.\n\nA third approach, associated with contractualism, sees moral status in\nterms of the attributes needed for membership in a moral community, or\nfor participation in relationships of mutual recognition and\n concern.[7]\n It is the capacity for forming such relationships, not their actual\nformation, which grounds full moral status. A cognitively normal human\nbeing would have such status even if he were abandoned on a desert\nisland. This approach, the most clearly symmetrical, treats certain\nattributes as necessary for moral status not because their mere\npossession generates moral obligations, but because they are\nrequisites for the kind of relationships in terms of which the\nproponents of this approach understand moral obligations. This\nrequirement may appear to give cognitive and psychological attributes\na more instrumental role than they are assigned by the second\napproach. It\u2019s not that their mere possession demands respect,\nbut that they enable their possessors to form relationships of which\nmutual respect is an integral part.\n\nThough relationship-based accounts differ conceptually from\nrespect-based accounts, they differ little in practical terms. They\nwill identify different human beings as having full moral status only\nif humans can have the cognitive or other psychological capacities\nnecessary for respect while lacking the empathy or motivation\nnecessary for membership in a moral community (or vice-versa). For\nexample, a moral-relationship account might exclude psychopaths. But\nso might a respect-based account, if it denied psychopaths autonomy\nbecause they lacked the capacity to be motivated by a sense of duty,\nor more broadly, a capacity to recognize and act on moral reasons (see\nShoemaker 2007). A respect-based account might also exclude\npsychopaths if it attributed their moral deficits to severe\ndisabilities in practical rationality. Relationship-based accounts\nwould, like Kantian ones, appear to set a very high threshold for full\nmoral status. The greater the moral accountability demanded by the\nrelationship, the more difficult it may be to claim that human beings\nwith radical cognitive impairments are capable of participation.\n\nOne challenge for all of these accounts is to identify an attribute or\nattributes that can explain, or at least be reconciled with, the\nthreshold and range features of the prevailing concept of moral\nstatus. The difficulty presented by a threshold is that it imposes\nmoral discontinuity over psychologically continuous attributes. In\ncontrast to the possession of a soul, for example, practical\nrationality, moral responsibility, and most other individual\nattributes claimed by contemporary accounts to ground moral status,\nappear to come in degrees. Looking at the development of an infant,\nthe acquisition of these attributes appears to be gradual, even if its\npace is uneven. And yet our judgment of moral status appears\ncategorical\u2014an individual either has full moral status or lacks\nit. The categorical character of moral status is also clear above the\nthreshold. We do not think that the more highly intelligent, more\ndeeply self-conscious, or more fully autonomous among us have a higher\nmoral status than the rest, even those near the edge. The challenge of\njustifying this range feature of full moral status is closely related\nto the challenge of justifying the threshold\u2014why should\ndifferences above the threshold be morally insignificant when the\nthreshold itself is so significant?\n",
