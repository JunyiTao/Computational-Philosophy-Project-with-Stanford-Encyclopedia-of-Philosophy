    "main_text": "Void, Motion in the Void\n9. Void, Motion in the Void\n\nAristotle stated the arguments of his predecessors for and against the\nexistence of the void, then he defined its exact meaning\n(Phys. IV.6, 213a12\u2013214a16). Afterwards he would refute\nthe existence of the void by proving that change and locomotion do not\ninvolve the existence of the void (214a16\u2013b11) and that void is\nincompatible with motion (214b12\u2013216b26).\n\nThe second set of arguments includes his explanation about velocity\nand the motion of bodies in the medium (Phys. IV.8,\n215a29\u2013216a21). Velocity depends on the heaviness or lightness\nof a falling body, but also on the density of the medium, water or\nair, for instance. The same body will fall at different velocities in\naccordance with the ratio of the various media. The role of the medium\nis to oppose resistance to any natural or violent motion, but\nAristotle does not see it as a hindrance but as necessarily\ncomplementing the action of the moving agent. The void has no density\nand since there is no ratio in which it stands to a body, motion would\nhappen within any imaginable time.\n\nPhiloponus disagreed with Aristotle and affirmed the existence of the\nvoid and the possibility of motion in it (CAG 17: 675\u2013695).\nCenturies later, Avempace denied the role of the medium as being\nnecessary for motion, and maintained that bodies can move in the void,\nbut a direct influence of Philoponus upon him has not been proved.\nAverroes ignored the issue in the Short Commentary but not in the\nMiddle Commentary. Averroes organizes the arguments against the\nexistence of the void in proofs, and the third proof as stated in MC\nBook IV, section 2, chapter 5 maintains that if there is no medium\n(em\u1e63a\u0559i), motion will happen in no time, and that\nthis is not possible. He opposes Avempace\u2019s view that the stone\ncan naturally move in time in the void and that the medium only makes\nits natural motion slower; the medium water slows down its fall less\nthan the medium air does (MC Kalonymos L\n52v\u00ba20\u201353r\u00ba23). Natural motion has its own velocity\nand the medium deducts from it, so that\n\n\nIf the movable would move in the void (requt), the movable\nwould be within time because [Avempace] thought that the local delay\nwould be removed from it and that its original motion would remain,\nand all this is false illusion. (MC Kalonymos L\n53r\u00ba1\u20133)\n\n\nAverroes does not accept the possibility of motion as addable or\ndeductible and insists in the oneness. In the Long Commentary he\ndevelops the principle. The issue of motion in the void occupies LC\n158L\u2013162C T71, and there Averroes expounds Avempace\u2019s\ncommentary making it known to the Latin philosophers, and Thomas of\nAquinas adopted the latter\u2019s view. Averroes knows that Avempace\nobjected that if motion needed a medium so that it happens in time,\nthe celestial spheres would rotate in no time (LC 160D TC71; Avempace\n[SST] 1974, 116: 6\u201318]).\n\nAverroes blames Avempace for misunderstanding the essence of velocity.\nVelocity is not a motion added to or subtracted from another motion,\nin this case, natural motion, \u201clike a line added or subtracted\nfrom a line\u201d (LC 161A). For Averroes, there is a ratio between\nthe power of mover and the resistance of the movable, and a ratio\nbetween the hindering and the hindered, and velocity depends on both\nfactors. Velocity in the celestial spheres results from the first kind\nof ratio, since there is no medium, and Averroes agrees with Avempace\nin considering the degree of nobleness (sharf) of the various\nspheres as the factor explaining their different velocities.\nSharf is the surplus of \u201cenergy\u201d between the\npower of motor and the resistance opposed by the movable.\n\nAverroes disagrees with Avempace concerning the movements of the four\nelements. He maintains that mover and movable among them are not\nreally different (distincta per se) because \u201cthe\nmovable thing is in potentiality, and the mover in actuality\u201d\n(LC 161K; MC Wolfson\n 673\u2013674).[8]\n The four elements are composed each of prime matter and a simple\nform, for instance, the elementary form of earth is coldness and\ndryness. Averroes affirms that the form is their mover, and matter,\ntheir movable thing (see below c. 12). Under this conception the\nmovable cannot oppose resistance to the mover, and motion without\nmedium would be impossible, because it would be in no time. The medium\nmakes motion possible because it introduces time (LC 161H; MC Wolfson\n403\u2013408). Averroes wanted to defend Aristotle and found this\nexplanation. Its weakness is obvious but the denial of motion in a\nvoid prevailed in medieval science (Maier 1952: 221\u2013223, 1958:\n244\u2013274).\n",
