    "main_text": "Leibniz on matter || The critique of atomism\n2.1 The critique of atomism\n\n\nAlthough there was much disagreement over details, early modern \natomists generally affirmed that complex bodies are to be understood \nas being composed of naturally indivisible material atoms moving \nabout in an independently existing space. Such atoms were commonly \nheld to lack all but a few basic properties such as size, shape, and \npossibly weight. While Leibniz himself was attracted to such a \nconception of body in his early years, he eventually came to see \natomism as deeply antithetical to his general understanding of the \nnatural world. Not surprisingly then, many of Leibniz\u2019s arguments \nagainst atomism attempt to show how common atomist commitments \nconflict with central principles of his mature natural \n philosophy.[11]\n\n\n\nOne such argument highlights a tension between Leibniz\u2019s principle of\ncontinuity \u2013 according to which \u201cno change happens \nthrough a leap\u201d \u2013 and the common assumption that material\natoms must be perfectly hard and inflexible. Taking for granted this \nsupposed perfect hardness and inflexibility, Leibniz argues that the \ncollision of any two atoms would lead to a discontinuous change in \nnature: \n\n\n[I]f we were to imagine that there are atoms, that is, bodies of \nmaximal hardness and therefore inflexible, it would follow that there\nwould be a change through a leap, that is, an instantaneous change. \nFor at the very moment of collision the direction to the motion \nreverses itself, unless we assume that the bodies come to rest \nimmediately after the collision, that is, lose their force; beyond \nthe fact that it would be absurd in other ways, this contains, again,\na change through a leap, and instantaneous change from motion to \nrest, without passing through the intermediate steps. (SD II.3/AG \n132)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion here is that collisions between perfectly hard, \ninflexible atoms would violate the principle of continuity since \n\u2013 being unable to flex or give \u2013 their directions and \nspeeds would have to change instantaneously upon contact. Tacitly \nrejecting the possibility that continuity could be preserved by \naction at a distance, Leibniz insists that continuity presupposes \nelasticity, and that elasticity in turn presupposes having parts that\ncan move relative to one another. Given that the original argument \ncan be invoked no matter how small the colliding bodies, Leibniz \nconcludes that all bodies must be elastic, and must\ntherefore have parts, contrary to the central thesis of atomism.\nHe thus concludes that \u201cno body is so small that it is without \nelasticity, and furthermore \u2026 there are no elements of bodies \n\u2026 nor are there little solid globes \u2026 both determinate \nand hard. Rather, the analysis proceeds to infinity\u201d \n(SD.II.45/AG 132\u2013133). \n\n\nAnother line of argument offered by Leibniz against material atomism \nhighlights a tension with what might be called his \u201cprinciple \nof plentitude.\u201d That principle, grounded in Leibniz\u2019s broader \ntheological and metaphysical views, maintains that existence itself \nis good, and as a consequence God creates as much being as is \nconsistent with the laws of logic and his own moral goodness. \nNaturally, Leibniz sees the principle of plentitude as being \ninconsistent with the existence of a barren void or interspersed \nvacua:\n\n\n[T]o admit the void in nature is ascribing to God a very imperfect\nwork \u2026 I lay it down as a principle that every perfection which\nGod could impart to things, without derogating from their other\nperfections, has actually been imparted to them. Now let us fancy a\nspace wholly empty. God could have placed some matter in it without\nderogating, in any respect, from all other things; therefore, he has\nactually placed some matter in that space; therefore, there is no\nspace wholly empty; therefore, all is full. (G VII.378/AG\n332)\n\n\nInterestingly, Leibniz uses the principle of plentitude not only to \nargue against the atomists\u2019 postulation of empty space, but \nalso against the possibility of simple indivisible atoms themselves. \nFor, Leibniz argues, no matter how small one imagines atoms to be, as\nlong as they are reckoned internally simple and homogenous, the world\ncould still contain more variety, richness, and being if they were \nmore finely divided. He thus draws the characteristic conclusion that\n\u201cThe least corpuscle is actually subdivided in infinitum and \ncontains a world of other creatures which would be wanting in the \nuniverse if that corpuscle were an atom, that is, a body of one \nentire piece without subdivision\u201d (G VII.377\u2013378/AG 332).\n\n\nA third, somewhat obscure, but especially intriguing line of argument\ntakes off from a position defended by Descartes in his Principles\nof Philosophy and touches on Leibniz\u2019s work on the so-called \n\u201cLabyrinth of the Continuum.\u201d In the Principles,\nDescartes had argued that (i) the world is a plenum, (ii) all motion \nin a plenum must be circular, and (iii) such circular motion \npresupposes the \u201cinfinite, or indefinite, division of the \nvarious particles of matter\u201d as they adjust and shift to \naccommodate a continuous flow around bends and through narrows (AT \nVIIIA.59/CSM 1:239). Concerning these propositions, Leibniz \napprovingly remarks, \u201cWhat Descartes says here is most \nbeautiful and worthy of his genius, namely, that every motion in \nfilled space involves circulation and that matter must somewhere be \nactually divided into parts smaller than any given quantity\u201d (L\n393). But whereas Descartes had insisted only on the \n\u201cindefinite\u201d division of \u201cmerely some part of \nmatter\u201d (AT VIIIA.60/CSM 239) Leibniz pushes for a stronger \nconclusion. Dismissing Descartes\u2019s cautious \u201cindefinite \ndivision\u201d as \u201cbeing not in the thing, but in the \nthinker,\u201d he takes the argument to show that every part of \nmatter is actually infinitely divided (A VI.ii.264). Similarly, \nrather than apparently restricting the infinite division of matter to\nsome select moving parts, Leibniz maintains that every part of matter\nis everywhere moving, and so the sort of accommodation envisioned by \nDescartes must occur everywhere (A. 6.3.565f; 6.3.58f). Thus, for \nLeibniz, not only are some parts of matter actually infinitely \ndivided, but every part of matter is divided to infinity (Levey 1998,\nfn6)!\n\n\nThe actual infinite division of all matter is, of course, sufficient \nto rule out any standard picture of material atomism since any body \nthat might lay claim to being an indivisible atom would itself be \nactually subdivided into smaller sub-bodies. But Leibniz is not done.\nEven more radically, he argues that Descartes\u2019s initial \nconsiderations lead not \u201cmerely\u201d to the conclusion that \nthere are no smallest bodies, but furthermore show that strictly \nspeaking no determinate shapes can be ascribed to bodies at all. \n\n\n[W]ith respect to shape, I uphold another paradox, namely, that there\nis no shape exact and real, and that neither sphere, nor parabola, \nnor other perfect shape will ever be found in body\u2026. One will\nalways find there inequalities to infinity. That comes about because \nmatter is actually subdivided to infinity. (translated, Sleigh 1990, \n112) \n\n\nAlthough how to best interpret Leibniz\u2019s arguments for the ideality \nof exact shape \u2013 and indeed how to best interpret his \nadmittedly paradoxical conclusion \u2013 remains open for debate, \nthe general idea here seems clear enough. While mechanistic physics \nappeals to exact shapes like cubes and spheres, the actual \ninfinite division of matter reveals that these can be at best \napproximations of the shapes of real bodies. For the shapes of real \nbodies must \u2013 again at best \u2013 be infinitely complex since\nthey are everywhere divided into bodies actually distinct in virtue \nof their differing accommodating motions. Although Leibniz\u2019s \nconclusion is especially bold and enigmatic, it is nonetheless not \nuntypical for him in so far as it suggests that mechanism \u2013 carefully thought \nthrough \u2013 points towards a radically different underlying metaphysical \nreality. \n",
