He was\nattracted to this conclusion early in his career, perhaps as a result\nof his mystical experiences. In June of 1889, McTaggart wrote in a\nletter to Roger Fry that he had some ideas about the elimination of\ntime (1991, 59). His 1896 book Studies in the Hegelian\nDialectic contains an argument for the unreality of time in\nsections 141\u2013142, but this argument is very unlike the ones that\nsucceed it. In 1908, he published \u201cThe Unreality of Time\u201d\nin Mind. This argument was later reincarnated in the second\nvolume of the Nature of Existence.\n\n\nMcTaggart distinguished two ways of ordering events or positions in\ntime. First, they might be ordered by the relation of earlier\nthan. This ordering gives us a series, which McTaggart calls\nthe B-series. A second ordering is imposed by designating some\nmoment within the B-series as the present moment. This second\nordering gives us a series that McTaggart calls the\nA-series. According to McTaggart, in order for time to be\nreal both series must exist, although McTaggart holds that, in some\nsense, the A-series is more fundamental than the B-series.\n\n\nAlthough there are various ways to reconstruct McTaggart\u2019s\nargument, for our purposes it will suffice to consider the following\none:\n\n\nTime is real only if real change occurs.\nReal change occurs only if the A-series exists.\nThe A-series does not exist.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, time is not real.\n\nMcTaggart has comparatively little to say in support of premise (1).\n(We find McTaggart accepting premise (1) in as early a work as his\nStudies in the Hegelian Dialectic, section 144.) Roughly,\nMcTaggart\u2019s rationale for premise (2) is that the contents of\npositions are events. There is real change only if events change, and\nthe only way an event can change is by first being future, then\npresent, and then past, i.e., by changing positions in the A-series.\nAccording to McTaggart, an event enjoying qualitative variation across\nits temporal axis, such as a poker that begins hot and later cools,\ndoes not constitute an example of real change, since it is always the\ncase that the earlier part of this event is hotter than the later part\nof this event. For this reason, McTaggart rejects the account of\nchange offered by Bertrand Russell in his Principles of\nMathematics (section 442), according to which something changes\njust in case a proposition true of it at one time is not true of it\nwhen evaluated at a later time. (With respect to any\nproposition P, if P has some truth-value when\nevaluated at a time, it is always the case that P has that\ntruth-value when evaluated at that time.)\n\n\nIn general, McTaggart believes that facts about positions in\nB-series are \u2018fixed\u2019 in the sense that they are always true\nno matter which time is present. The only thing left to change then is\nwhich events are actually present. So if there is no A-series, if\nnothing is truly ever present, past or future, then there is no\nchange.\n\nMcTaggart argues for premise (3) by attempting to demonstrate that the\nexistence of the A-series would generate a contradiction.\nAccording to McTaggart, being present, being past,\nand being future are incompatible determinations. But\neverything in time must have each of them. How best to reconstruct the\n rationale for this premise is highly\n contentious.[9]\n The intuitive picture seems to\nbe this. Consider an event that from our perspective is past. Perhaps\nit is the event of McTaggart first considering the unreality of time.\nFrom the perspective of that event, it is present (and we are future).\nHowever, the ordering generated by the A-series is supposed to be an\nobjective ordering: an A-series is not thereby generated simply by\none\u2019s arbitrary choice of a point of time as the present. Since\nthe respective situations are symmetrical, there is no reason to prefer\none perspective over the other. If we take both perspectives as being\ncorrect, then we must say of some event (and every event by parity of\nreasoning) that it is past, present, and future. So instead we should\nsay that neither perspective is correct, and that the A-series does not\nexist.\n\n\nAlthough time is unreal, our perception of temporal order is not wholly\ndelusory, for there is a real relation that really orders apparently\ntemporal events in the way that they appear to be ordered in the\nB-series. This relation itself generates a series, which McTaggart\ncalls the C-series. (For this reason, McTaggart describes his denial of\nthe reality of time as Hegelian rather than Kantian, since (on\nMcTaggart\u2019s interpretation) although both thinkers denied the\nreality of time, only Hegel thought that there was an underlying\nreality to which the apparent reality of time corresponded.) Were there\nto be an A-series, the conjunction of it with the C-series would yield\na B-series.\n\n\nMcTaggart entertained several theories about the nature of the\nC-series. One theory that he did not seriously argue against is the\nview that the C-relation is a primitive transitive, asymmetric relation\nfor which nothing positive may be said concerning\n it.[10]\nI will briefly discuss a\ntheory that he entertains in his article \u201cThe Relation of Time to\nEternity\u201d, which was re-published in Mind in 1909 but\nwas written at least two years before. (This article is also reprinted\nin Philosophical Studies.)\n\nIn this article, McTaggart distinguishes three meanings of the term\n\u201ceternity\u201d: the sense in which time might be eternal in\nthat it is infinitely extended, the sense in which\npropositions (conceived as abstract objects) are eternally or\ntimelessly true, and the sense of eternity that pertains to existent\nthings that are not temporally located. An example of a putatively\neternal being in this sense is a God conceived as existing outside of\ntime. McTaggart focuses on the third sense of \u201ceternal\u201d,\nwhich is the sense in which, given the unreality of time, every\nexistent is eternal.\n\n\nAlthough the eternal is timeless, some temporal metaphors might more\naptly characterize the eternal than others. Some theists describe the\nlife of the divine being as one that is \u2018eternally\npresent\u2019, an expression that on its face is explicitly\ncontradictory. Yet describing the divine life as eternally present\nseems more apt than describing it as eternally past. McTaggart cites\nseveral considerations that favor metaphorically describing the eternal\nas present. First, the present changes only by ceasing to be present\nand the eternal never changes. The constancy of the eternal is like\nthat of the present while it continues to be present. Second,\nmany hold that the present enjoys more reality than the past or the\nfuture, and many also hold that eternal things enjoy more reality than\nthat which is in time. So the present is more like the eternal than is\nthe past, at least in this respect. Third, the role of the eternal in\nour emotional lives seems similar to the role of the present. McTaggart\nclaims that one who loves an eternal God experiences an emotion\nrelevantly like one who loves a presently existing thing, and not at\nall alike the emotion of one who loves something that is merely past or\nyet to be. Finally, neither past things nor future things have causal\nefficacy, but arguably both present and eternal things do.\n\n\nAlthough these considerations favor metaphorically describing the\neternal as present, they are not decisive. McTaggart argues that there\nis some reason to favor instead metaphorically describing the eternal\nas future. Suppose that time is unreal, but there is a real ordering\ncorresponding to the apparent temporal ordering. In other words,\nsuppose that there is a C-series. One theory of the C-series is that it\nis an adequacy series. The things ordered by the C-series are\nrepresentations of how reality actually is, and the relation\nthat generates the C-series is x is less adequate than y. On\nthis view, states that appear to be present more accurately represent\nreality than states that appear to be past, but both in turn are less\naccurate representations than states that appear to be future. The\nterminal end of the C-series consists in maximally adequate, i.e., true\nrepresentations of how reality is. Reality is timeless. So the final\nstage of a series of representations that gives rise to the appearance\nof a temporal order is a stage that represents reality as being\ntimeless. For this reason, McTaggart holds that it is appropriate to\ndescribe the eternal as being future.\n\nIn chapters 44\u201350 of the second volume of the Nature of\nExistence, McTaggart reassesses and rejects the theory that the\nC-series is generated by the relation of being less adequate than. He\nultimately settles on the view that the C-series is an \u201cinclusion\nseries\u201d, one in which each element in the series has as a proper\npart its predecessor in the C-series. The elements of the inclusion\nseries are misperceptions of reality, but they are not ordered merely\nby the relation x is less accurate than y. Strictly,\nMcTaggart distinguishes many C-series, one for which each perceiver,\nbut argues that they are commensurable. The illusion of time is\nsomehow generated by facts about the parthood relations obtaining\nbetween mistaken perceptions, but how exactly this illusion is\ngenerated is a question McTaggart admits to not having an answer.\n\n\nAccording to McTaggart, although time is unreal, temporal judgments\ncan be well or ill-founded in the sense that, given how things actually\nare, some judgments about time and temporal ordering capture real facts\nabout the underlying reality that gives rise to the appearance of time.\nSo, for example, reality is such that it is better to say that World\nWar I took place after the American civil war than it is to say that\nthe American civil war took place after World War I. Although\nboth judgments are false, the former judgment at least correctly orders\nsome events in a real series, whereas the latter does not.\n",
