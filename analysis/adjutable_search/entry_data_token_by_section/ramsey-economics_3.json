    "main_text": "The Problem of Optimum Saving\n3. The Problem of Optimum Saving\n\n\nRamsey considered a world with an indefinite future. This could\nappear to be an odd move, but it has a strong rationale. Suppose DM\nwere to choose a horizon of \\(T\\) years. As she doesn\u2019t know when\nour world will end, she will want to specify the resources that should\nbe left behind at \\(T\\) in case the world doesn\u2019t terminate then.\nBut to find a justification for the amount to leave behind at\n\\(T\\), DM will need an assessment of the world beyond \\(T\\).\nThat would, however, amount to including the world beyond \\(T\\).\nAnd so on.\n\n\nDenote a consumption stream from the present \\((t = 0)\\) to infinity\nas \\(\\{C(t)\\}.\\) \\(K(0) \\gt 0\\) circumscribes the economy; it is the\nquantity of capital that society has inherited from the\npast. Mathematicians would call \\(K(0)\\) an \u201cinitial\ncondition.\u201d The problem Ramsey set himself was to determine the\nconsumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) from 0 to infinity that DM would\nselect if she were a Classical Utilitarian.\n",
