    "main_text": "\nIssues and problems of interpretation of written texts are distinct\nfrom issues and problems of translations of them, but the two can\nrarely be analyzed apart from each other. Moreover, both are closely\nrelated by matters of language. Difficulties encountered in\ntranslation of texts obviously generate difficulties in interpreting\nthem, and vice versa: the less confidence we have that we\nunderstand what a text is about the more difficult it is to be\nconfident of our own (or anyone else\u2019s) translation of it.\nThus an appreciation of problems discussed in this essay must begin\nwith an examination of the issues and problems stemming from the\nclassical language in which Chinese philosophers wrote and edited\ntheir texts long ago, which will not only be necessary for\nunderstanding and evaluating the texts themselves, but perhaps useful\nas well for seeing some more general issues in metaphilosophy,\ncross-cultural philosophy, the philosophy of language, and the\nphilosophy of mind in a somewhat different light.\n A second reason for the complexity of the topics related to this\nentry is that some knowledge of the early philosophical\u2014and\nother\u2014texts were and are prerequisite for understanding all\nlater philosophy because of the frequency of the references to them,\nand also because they provided the basic model for the writing of the\nlater ones. Unfortunately most of these early Chinese texts have come\ndown to us only in corrupted form, increasing significantly the number\nand variety of issues and problems of translating and interpreting\nthem, especially if our primary concern is to provide exegeses and\ntranslations of them in terms of what they meant to the people who\nfirst wrote and read them.\nMoreover, the texts as we have them in English today have been\nvariously translated and interpreted by scholars and others with very\ndifferent backgrounds and interests for most of the past two\ncenturies: missionaries first, followed by merchants and diplomats\nlong-term resident in China, followed in the 20th century\nby academics from a wide variety of disciplines, including history,\nliterature, linguistics, religion, Asian Studies (sinology), and now,\nfor the past several decades, philosophers. Needless to say, many\ndifferent translations and interpretations of virtually all of the\nclassical texts mirror closely the disparate concerns and agendas of\ntheir publishers. They all do, however, share a decidedly Western\norientation in style, outlook, methodology, and more; seldom are\nthings viewed from the Chinese perspective, and consequently charges\nof a Eurocentric bias in Chinese philosophy as a field of study are\nunfortunately not without merit, increasing yet again the problems of\ninterpreting them appropriately.\nIn addition to the unusual nature of the classical Chinese\nlanguage, corrupted texts, and the variety of people who have worked\nwith them, a fourth reason for the complexity of the topic of this\nentry is also the reason significantly responsible for its being the\nonly one of its kind in this Encyclopedia. There are no entries under\n\u201cTranslating and Interpreting\u2026\u201d for Greek\nphilosophy, for example, nor German Idealism or French Postmodernism.\nEven Indian philosophy lacks such an entry. This fact should bring\nhome not just the singularity of the classical Chinese written\nlanguage, compared to contemporary languages derived from the\nproto-Sanskrit Indo-European family of languages written in alphabet\nscripts, but remind us as well of the greater distance between Chinese\nand other cultures from past to present. This is in good measure due\nto geography: India and Greece have been in contact since before the\nAlexandrian conquests, but the Himalayas, Xinjiang and Gobi deserts,\nand the East China Sea made for a fairly solitary cultural development\nin China that for many centuries hindered cross-cultural intercourse\nexcept for the cultures on its periphery, Korea, Japan, and areas of\nSoutheast Asia. The Silk Roads notwithstanding, we find few\ncross-cultural western links with the Chinese as we do for the Indian\n(as, e.g., the Hindu god of fire Agni with Latin ignis, root\nof English \u201cignite\u201d). It is not necessarily that China is\nthe ultimate \u201cOther\u201d for Europeans and for writers in\nEuropean traditions, but rather that its heritage is much like\nEuropean traditions in many of its formal dimensions, yet so different\nin details, and that writers in European traditions have only come\nupon the scope and depth of that heritage comparatively recently. It\nis not for nothing that Leibniz referred to China as the\n\u201cOriental Europe\u201d (Leibniz WoC: 12 [1708]).\nAfter coming to understand how the classical Chinese language\nitself poses problems for translators and interpreters we will then\nexamine other issues methodological, metaphysical, and comparative\nrelating to the reading of classical texts which tend to combine\nexegetical and translation concerns.\nThe primary focus will be on those issues in dispute among scholars\nin the field (not alone philosophers) which have philosophical\nimplications, attempting balanced accounts of both the disputes and the\nimplications. At times authors will be quoted at some length to insure\nthat their positions have not been distorted in the course of their\nnarration.  \nAs noted above, the linguistic focus will be somewhat narrow\ntemporally\u2014by Chinese standards, at least: the period from\nroughly the 7th through the 1st centuries\nBCE. Most of the framing texts that became canonical in one tradition\nor another were written, compiled, edited, and much else during this\nperiod, and the classical language grew and was maturing at the same\ntime. It continued to grow during the whole of later Chinese history,\nand canonical texts were added to the corpus throughout the same\nperiod; but the bases for both were laid during the earlier period,\nsome knowledge of which were (and are) requisite for interpreting and\ntranslating them.\nNone of what has been said up to this point is to suggest that\nstudying Chinese language and early thought is only for the\nclassically curious and linguistically intrepid. There has been an\nexplosion of scholarly growth in classical Chinese studies over the\npast half-century, sufficient in both breadth and depth to allow\nnon-specialists to read translations of Chinese philosophical texts\nwith sensitivity and understanding. Translations of primary and\nsecondary texts and philosophical commentaries thereon have grown\napace, with a multiplicity of exegetical orientations, as have\nliterary, historical, religious, and other studies that collectively\nhave been shrinking the claimed mysteriousness of the East almost to\nthe vanishing point. There are, for instance, over 150 translations in\nEnglish alone of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), and a\ndozen different renditions of the Confucian Analects are in\ncommon use today in courses dealing with Chinese thought. Thus a\npaucity of materials can no longer be used as an excuse for not\nincluding classical Chinese philosophical texts in undergraduate\ncourses, or indeed in the several philosophical discourses now current\nin professional circles. Some rudimentary knowledge of how the\nlanguage works can also be of value to readers in their academic\nstudies and/or participation in these discourses, not least by helping\nthem in understanding and analyzing how and why both translations and\ninterpretations of Chinese philosophical texts can and do differ from\neach other\u2014at times in significant ways, thus enabling them to\nevaluate their readings in the subject matter for themselves. It may\nserve as well to see some contemporary issues in philosophy of\nlanguage, or mind, or in metaphysics from a slightly different\nperspective, and for all these reasons this entry may also serve in a\nsmall way as a \u201cstate of the art\u201d essay on the field.\n",
