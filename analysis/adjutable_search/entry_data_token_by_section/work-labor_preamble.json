    "main_text": "\n\nWork is a subject with a long philosophical pedigree. Some of the most\ninfluential philosophical systems devote considerable attention to\nquestions concerning who should work, how they should work, and why.\nFor example, in the ideally just city outlined in the\nRepublic, Plato proposed a system of labor specialization,\naccording to which individuals are assigned to one of three economic\nstrata, based on their inborn abilities: the laboring or mercantile\nclass, a class of auxiliaries charged with keeping the peace and\ndefending the city, or the ruling class of\n\u2018philosopher-kings\u2019. Such a division of labor, Plato\nargued, will ensure that the tasks essential to the city\u2019s\nflourishing will be performed by those most capable of performing\nthem.\n\nIn proposing that a just society must concern itself with how work is\nperformed and by whom, Plato acknowledged the centrality of work to\nsocial and personal life. Indeed, most adults spend a significant time\nengaged in work, and many contemporary societies are arguably\n\u201cemployment-centred\u201d (Gorz 2010). In such societies, work\nis the primary source of income and is \u2018normative\u2019 in the\nsociological sense, i.e., work is expected to be a central feature of\nday-to-day life, at least for adults.\n\nArguably then, no phenomenon exerts a greater influence on the quality\nand conditions of human life than work. Work thus deserves the same\nlevel of philosophical scrutiny as other phenomena central to economic\nactivity (for example, markets or property) or collective life (the\nfamily, for instance).\n\nThe history of philosophy contains an array of divergent perspectives\nconcerning the place of work in human life (Applebaum 1992, Schaff\n2001, Budd 2011, Lis and Soly 2012, Komlosy 2018). Traditional\nConfucian thought, for instance, embraces hard work, perseverance, the\nmaintenance of professional relations, and identification with\norganizational values. The ancient Mediterranean tradition,\nexemplified by Plato and Aristotle, admired craft and knowledge-driven\nproductive activity while also espousing the necessity of leisure and\nfreedom for a virtuous life. The Christian tradition contains several\ndifferent views of work, including that work is toil for human sin,\nthat work should be a calling or vocation by which one glorifies God\nor carries out God\u2019s will, and that work is an arena in which to\nmanifest one\u2019s status as elect in the eyes of God (the\n\u2018Protestant work ethic\u2019). The onset of the Industrial\nRevolution and the adverse working conditions of industrial labor\nsparked renewed philosophical interest in work, most prominently in\nMarxist critiques of work and labor that predict the alienation of\nworkers under modern capitalism and the emergence of a classless\nsociety in which work is minimized or equitably distributed.\n\nPhilosophical attention to work and labor seems to increase when work\narrangements or values appear to be in flux. For example, recent years\nhave witnessed an increase in philosophical research on work, driven\nat least in part by the perception that is in \u2018crisis\u2019:\nEconomic inequality in employment-centred societies continues to rise,\ntechnological automation seems poised to eliminate jobs and to augur\nan era of persistent high unemployment, and dissatisfaction about the\nquality or meaningfulness of work in present day jobs appears to be\nincreasing (Schwartz 2015, Livingston 2016, Graeber 2018, Danaher\n2019). Many scholars now openly question whether work should be\ntreated as a \u2018given\u2019 in modern societies (Weeks 2011).\n\nThis entry will attempt to bring systematicity to the extant\nphilosophical literature on work by examining the central conceptual,\nethical, and political questions in the philosophy of work and labor\n(Appiah 2021).\n",
