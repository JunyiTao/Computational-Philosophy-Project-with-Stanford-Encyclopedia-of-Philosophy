    "main_text": "Gottsched and His Critics: Truth and Imagination || Bodmer and Breitinger\n2.2 Bodmer and Breitinger\n\nGottsched\u2019s work became the subject of a \u201cwar of the\npoets\u201d with the Swiss writers Johann Jacob Bodmer and Johann\nJacob Breitinger. Bodmer (1698\u20131783) taught Swiss history in\nZ\u00fcrich for forty years, advocated the works of Dante and\nShakespeare, and translated Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost into\nGerman prose. Breitinger (1701\u201376) taught Greek, Hebrew, logic,\nand rhetoric, and edited the works of the German Baroque poet Martin\nOpitz. Together, they edited Die Discourse der Mahlern\n(\u201cThe Discourse of the Painters\u201d), Switzerland\u2019s first\n\u201cmoral weekly\u201d based on the model of The\nSpectator, from 1721\u201323. These essays did not concern\npainting at all or even general issues about the arts very\nmuch\u2014the name merely reflects their use of the names of famous\npainters as pseudonymous signatures for their articles\u2014although\none of Bodmer\u2019s articles on Opitz celebrated the imagination as the\nkey to poetic success: \u201cA writer such as our Opitz who has\nenriched and filled the imagination with images of things can write\npoetry that is lively and natural\u201d and by \u201cthe strength of\nhis imagination bring back all the ideas that he had when he was\nreally in love, empathetic, depressed, or enraged\u201d (Die\nDiscourse der Mahlern, Erster Theil, XIX Discourse, cited\nfrom Dichtungstheorien der Aufkl\u00e4rung, p. 13).\n\n\nThe emphasis on the imagination seems to have been the central issue\nin Bodmer and Breitinger\u2019s dispute with Gottsched, which came to a\nhead in Breitinger\u2019s own Critische Dichtkunst, published in\n1740 with a forward by Bodmer.  Because they shared with Gottsched the\ngeneral assumption that art is based on the imitation of nature and\nhas the goal of making important moral truths come alive for us, it is\nhard to see exactly what divided the two sides in this dispute, but\nthe key seems to lie in their conception of poetic fables. As we saw,\nGottsched believed that a poetic fable describes events in a possible\nrather than in the actual world, but he insists that the laws of\nnature and human nature must remain constant: thus a poetic fable can\ndepict a hero who never existed, and make some moral truth alive to us\nthrough its depiction of this possible rather than actual hero, but\neverything about this hero and his world should still be\nnatural. Bodmer and Breitinger, however, as advocates of Shakespeare\nand Milton, believed that important moral truths could be made alive\nto us through works of the poetic imagination that depart more\ndrastically from actual nature and history. They held that novelty is\nan especially powerful source of aesthetic pleasure and thus an\nespecially powerful means of making moral truths come alive, and for\nthis reason they concluded that \u201csince the most ancient\ntimes\u201d the fable has been the means \u201cfor bringing the most\nuseful but at the same time best known moral truths home to us in a\npleasing way\u201d (Breitinger, Critische Dichtkunst, cited\nfrom Dichtungstheorien der Aufkl\u00e4rung, p. 42). Their idea is\nthat the more imaginative inventions of the poets\u2014the Satan of\nMilton or the Caliban of Shakespeare rather than the more human heroes\nof Racine and Corneille admired by Gottsched\u2014make moral truths\nappear more alive precisely by their attention-grabbing departure from\nthe familiar creatures of the real world. Thus Bodmer and Breitinger\nthought that the moralistic aim of poetry that they accepted in common\nwith Gottsched could be better achieved by a freer use of the\nimagination in poetry than Gottsched was prepared to allow. They\nagreed in their philosophical analysis of the ends of art but\ndisagreed in their empirical assessment of its most effective\nmeans.\n\n\nBy their advocacy of Milton and Shakespeare, the most imaginative\npoets of the preceding century, Bodmer and Breitinger prepared the way\nfor subsequent artistic movements that emphasized the freedom of the\nimagination, even while they continued to work within the conceptual\nframework of Wolffian perfectionism. The same is true for two\nprofessional philosophers of the time who also worked within the\nWolffian framework but took at least one step towards an aesthetic\ntheory that could subsequently give the play of the mental powers\nequal importance with the sensible representation of truth by treating\nthe aesthetic qualities of representations as parallel to rather than\nidentical with their purely cognitive qualities. So let us now turn to\nthe innovations of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten and his disciple and\nally, Georg Friedrich Meier. Meier actually responded directly to\nGottsched in a number of polemics, but since his views were based\nlargely\u2014although not entirely\u2014on Baumgarten\u2019s, it will be\nbetter to treat them together than to treat Meier now.\n",
