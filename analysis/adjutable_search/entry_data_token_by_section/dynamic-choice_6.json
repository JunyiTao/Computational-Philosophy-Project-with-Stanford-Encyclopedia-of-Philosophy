Solving Dynamic Choice Problems\n\nGiven how much trouble dynamic choice problems can cause, it is\nnatural to wonder whether and how they can be solved. Various\nsolutions of varying scope have been proposed in the literature on\ndynamic choice. The first three subsections that follow focus on ideas\nregarding the practical issue of dealing with dynamic choice problems.\nThe fourth subsection focuses on attempts at resolving the theoretical\npuzzles concerning rational choice raised by various dynamic choice\nproblems.\n",
