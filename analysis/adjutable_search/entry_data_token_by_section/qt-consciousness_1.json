Philosophical Background Assumptions\n\nVariants of the dichotomy between mind and matter range from their\nfundamental distinction at a primordial level of description to the\nemergence of mind (consciousness) from the brain as an extremely\nsophisticated and highly developed material system. Informative\noverviews can be found in Popper and Eccles (1977), Chalmers (1996),\nand Pauen (2001).\n\nOne important aspect of all discussions about the relation between\nmind and matter is the distinction between descriptive and\nexplanatory approaches. For instance, correlation is\na descriptive term with empirical relevance, while causation\nis an explanatory term associated with theoretical attempts to\nunderstand correlations. Causation implies correlations between cause\nand effect, but this does not always apply the other way around:\ncorrelations between two systems can result from a common cause in\ntheir history rather than from a direct causal interaction.\n\nIn the fundamental sciences, one typically speaks of causal relations\nin terms of interactions. In physics, for instance, there are four\nfundamental kinds of interactions (electromagnetic, weak, strong,\ngravitational) which serve to explain the correlations that are\nobserved in physical systems. As regards the mind-matter problem, the\nsituation is more difficult. Far from a theoretical understanding in\nthis field, the existing body of knowledge essentially consists of\nempirical correlations between material and mental states. These\ncorrelations are descriptive, not explanatory; they are not causally\nconditioned. It is (for some purposes) interesting to know\nthat particular brain areas are activated during particular\nmental activities; but this does, of course, not explain why\nthey are. Thus, it would be premature to talk about mind-matter\ninteractions in the sense of causal relations. For the sake of\nterminological clarity, the neutral notion of relations between mind\nand matter will be used in this article.\n\nIn many discussions of material [ma] brain states and mental [me]\nstates of consciousness, the relations between them are conceived in a\ndirect way\n (A):\n \n\\[\n[\\mathbf{ma}] \\substack{\\leftarrow \\\\ \\rightarrow} [\\mathbf{me}]\n\\]\n\n\nThis illustrates a minimal framework to study reduction,\nsupervenience, or emergence relations (Kim 1998; Stephan 1999) which\ncan yield both monistic and dualistic pictures. For instance, there is\nthe influential stance of strong reduction, stating that all\nmental states and properties can be reduced to the material domain or\neven to physics\n (physicalism).[3]\n This point of view claims that it is both necessary and sufficient to\nexplore and understand the material domain, e.g., the brain, in order\nto understand the mental domain, e.g., consciousness. It leads to a\nmonistic picture, in which any need to discuss mental states is\neliminated right away or at least considered as epiphenomenal. While\nmind-brain correlations are still legitimate though causally\nirrelevant from an epiphenomenalist point of view, eliminative\nmaterialism renders even correlations irrelevant.\n\nMuch discussed counterarguments against the validity of such strong\nreductionist approaches are qualia arguments, which emphasize the\nimpossibility for physicalist accounts to properly incorporate the\nquality of the subjective experience of a mental state, the\n\u201cwhat it is like to be\u201d (Nagel 1974) in that state. This\nleads to an explanatory gap between third-person and first-person\naccounts for which Chalmers (1995) has coined the notion of the\n\u201chard problem of consciousness\u201d. Another, less discussed\ncounterargument is that the physical domain itself is not causally\nclosed. Any solution of fundamental equations of motion (be it\nexperimentally, numerically, or analytically) requires to fix boundary\nconditions and initial conditions which are not given by the\nfundamental laws of nature (Primas 2002). This causal gap applies to\nclassical physics as well as quantum physics, where a basic\nindeterminacy due to collapse makes it even more challenging. A third\nclass of counterarguments refer to the difficulties to include notions\nof temporal present and nowness in a physical description (Franck\n2004, 2008; Primas 2017).\n\nHowever, relations between mental and material states can also be\nconceived in a non-reductive fashion, e.g. in terms of emergence\nrelations (Stephan 1999). Mental states and/or properties can be\nconsidered as emergent if the material brain is not necessary or not\nsufficient to explore and understand\n them.[4]\n This leads to a dualistic picture (less radical and more plausible\nthan Cartesian dualism) in which residua remain if one attempts to\nreduce the mental to the material. Within a dualistic scheme of\nthinking, it becomes almost inevitable to discuss the question of\ncausal influence between mental and material states. In particular,\nthe causal efficacy of mental states upon brain states\n(\u201cdownward causation\u201d) has recently attracted growing\ninterest (Velmans, 2002; Ellis et al.\n 2011).[5]\n The most popular approaches along those lines as far as quantum\nbehavior of the brain is concerned will be discussed in\n Section 3,\n \u201cQuantum Brain\u201d. \n\nIt has been an old idea by Bohr that central conceptual features of\nquantum theory, such as complementarity, are also of pivotal\nsignificance outside the domain of physics. In fact, Bohr became\nfamiliar with complementarity through the psychologist Edgar Rubin\nand, more indirectly, William James (Holton 1970) and immediately saw\nits potential for quantum physics. Although Bohr was also convinced of\nthe extraphysical relevance of complementarity, he never elaborated\nthis idea in concrete detail, and for a long time after him no one\nelse did so either. This situation has changed: there are now a number\nof research programs generalizing key notions of quantum theory in a\nway that makes them applicable beyond physics.\n\nOf particular interest for consciousness studies are approaches that\nhave been developed in order to pick up Bohr\u2019s proposal with\nrespect to psychology and cognitive science. The first steps in this\ndirection were made by the group of Aerts in the early 1990s (Aerts\net al. 1993), using non-distributive propositional lattices\nto address quantum-like behavior in non-classical systems. Alternative\napproaches have been initiated by Khrennikov (1999), focusing on\nnon-classical probabilities, and Atmanspacher et al. (2002),\noutlining an algebraic framework with non-commuting operations. The\nrecent development of ideas within this framework of thinking is\naddressed in\n Section 4,\n \u201cQuantum Mind\u201d. Other lines of thinking are due to Primas\n(2007, 2017), addressing complementarity with partial Boolean\nalgebras, and Filk and von M\u00fcller (2008), indicating links\nbetween basic conceptual categories in quantum physics and\npsychology.\n\nAs an alternative to (A), it is possible to conceive mind-matter\nrelations indirectly\n(B),\n via a third category: \n\n\\[\\begin{gather}\n[\\mathbf{ma}] \\quad [\\mathbf{me}] \\\\\n \\searrow\\nwarrow \\swarrow\\nearrow \\\\\n [\\mathbf{mame}]\n\\end{gather}\\]\n\n\nThis third category, here denoted [mame], is often regarded as being\nneutral with respect to the distinction between [ma] and [me], i.e.,\npsychophysically neutral. In scenario (B), issues of reduction and\nemergence concern the relation between the unseparated\n\u201cbackground reality\u201d [mame] and the distinguished aspects\n[ma] and [me].\n\nSuch \u201cdual aspect\u201d frameworks of thinking have received\nincreasing attention in contempory discussion, and they have a long\ntradition reaching back as far as to Spinoza. In the early days of\npsychophysics, Fechner (1861) and Wundt (1911) advocated related\nviews. Whitehead, the modern pioneer of process philosophy, referred\nto mental and physical poles of \u201cactual occasions\u201d, which\nthemselves transcend their bipolar appearances (Whitehead 1978). Many\napproaches in the tradition of Feigl (1967) and Smart (1963), called\n\u201cidentity theories\u201d, conceive mental and material states\nas essentially identical \u201ccentral states\u201d, yet considered\nfrom different perspectives. Other variants of this idea have been\nsuggested by Jung and Pauli (1955) [see also Meier (2001)], involving\nJung\u2019s conception of a psychophysically neutral, archetypal\norder, or by Bohm and Hiley (Bohm 1990; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Hiley\n2001), referring to an implicate order which unfolds into the\ndifferent explicate domains of the mental and the material. They will\nbe discussed in more detail in\n Section 5,\n \u201cBrain and Mind as Dual Aspects\u201d. \n\nVelmans (2002, 2009) has developed a similar approach, backed up with\nempirical material from psychology, and Strawson (2003) has proposed a\n\u201creal materialism\u201d which uses a closely related scheme.\nAnother proponent of dual-aspect thinking is Chalmers (1996), who\nconsiders the possibility that the underlying, psychophysically\nneutral level of description could be best characterized in terms of\ninformation.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it should be emphasized that many\npresent-day approaches prefer to distinguish between first-person and\nthird-person perspectives rather than mental and material states. This\nterminology serves to highlight the discrepancy between immediate\nconscious experiences (\u201cqualia\u201d) and their description, be\nit behavioral, neural, or biophysical. The notion of the \u201chard\nproblem\u201d of consciousness research refers to bridging the gap\nbetween first-person experience and third-person accounts of it. In\nthe present contribution, mental conscious states are implicitly\nassumed to be related to first-person experience. This does not mean,\nhowever, that the problem of how to define consciousness precisely is\nconsidered as resolved. Ultimately, it will be (at least) as difficult\nto define a mental state in rigorous terms as it is to define a\nmaterial state.\n",
