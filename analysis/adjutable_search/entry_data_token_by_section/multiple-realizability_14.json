    "main_text": "The Shifting Status of Multiple Realizability Early in the New Millennium || New Attacks on Multiple Realizability\n4. The Multiple Realization Book and Its Initial Critical Reception\n\nThomas Polger\u2019s and Lawrence Shapiro\u2019s The Multiple\nRealization Book (2016) provided what the increasingly\nfragmenting literature on multiple realizability needed. It is the\nfirst book-length treatment of the topic, including many of the\nbroader arguments the topic had become part of. The book pulls\ntogether much of the history of work on the topic, plus the more\nrecent work by both proponents and opponents, and usefully organizes\nall of this around numerous key themes that had come to frame the\nmyriad debates. Polger\u2019s and Shapiro\u2019s goal is not simply\nto review or clarify the various positions, however. They have a\nposition to push. They end up developing and defending a mind-brain\nidentity theory that explicitly recognizes a sense of the autonomy of\npsychology from neuroscience. And as one might expect, critics of\ntheir view quickly responded. The unifying focus that this book\noffers, and its initial critical reception, make a detailed discussion\nof it a useful focus for where the broader issues about multiple\nrealizability stand now, at the end of the second decade of the\ntwentieth century.\n\nPolger and Shapiro begin by focusing on the key contention that\nfunctionalists and \u201crealization physicalists\u201d have\nemphasized to support their views over identity theories. That thesis\nis \u201cGenerality\u201d, namely that \n\n\npsychological states are general rather than species-bound, such that\na range of creatures may possess the same psychological state. (2016:\n15) \n\n\nAnd the key premise offered in support of this contention, going back\nto Putnam\u2019s work (presented in\n \u00a71\n above) is multiple realizability. This contention sets the agenda for\nthe book: Polger and Shapiro will argue that there is not the sort of\nwidespread multiple realization of mental states and processes that\nwould be needed to support functionalism or realization physicalism\nover identity theory. Importantly, Polger and Shapiro do not deny that\ncases of multiple realization exist. Rather, they insist that the\ndebate between functionalists and mind-brain identity theorists should\nbe guided primarily by the question, \n\n\ndoes the best overall model of psychological and neuroscientific\nprocesses make substantial and important use of identities? (2016: 34)\n\n\n\nTheir goal is to defend an affirmative answer.\n\nPolger and Shapiro\u2019s book confirms that multiple realization has\nof late come to be fought in the metaphysics of science literature. In\nkeeping, they begin by offering an account of the ontological\nrealization relation. And following the lead of their (Shapiro &\nPolger 2012) paper (discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n above) they use this account to scout the types of evidence and\nconcerns relevant to deciding between realization physicalisms and\nidentity theories. They restrict the scope of their arguments to\nactual proposed cases of realization, eschewing at least initially\nconcern with philosophers\u2019 imagined cases; they are solely\nconcerned at the outset with multiple realization as an empirical\nhypothesis. They are also careful to point out that multiple\nrealization is logically narrower than mere variation. Working\ndirectly with Putnam\u2019s (1967) discussion, Polger and Shapiro\narticulate the \u201cBasic Recipe\u201d for finding occurrences of\nmultiple realization: \u201cMultiple realization occurs if and only\nif two (or more) systems perform the same function in different\nways\u201d (2016: 45). While this characterization requires further\nrefinement, even it is enough to rule out some kinds of\n\u201csameness\u201d that are not evidence for multiple realization,\ni.e., sameness of behavioral output. Two systems exhibiting the same\nbehavior in the same circumstances, Polger and Shapiro insist, does\nnot establish sameness of underlying psychological function generating\nthat behavior. \n\nFurther refinements introduce \u201crelevance\u201d into Polger and\nShapiro\u2019s account. The very function shared by the two kinds\nthat classifies them as the same in the realized science must be what\nis realized by different mechanisms that classify them as different in\nthe realizing science. Further, the relevant differences in the\nrealizers contribute to the sameness of function; the kinds are\n\u201cnot just differently different, they are differently the\nsame\u201d (2016: 75). Polger and Shapiro show that simple (camera)\nand compound eyes meet their fully revised \u201cOfficial\nRecipe\u201d for genuinely multiply realized kinds. They write: \n\n\nMultiple realization requires a special pattern of variation:\nrelevantly the same function performed in relevantly different ways,\nwhere the differences contribute to the sameness in function and not\njust to the differences in function. (2016: 77) \n\n\nArmed with their Official Recipe, Polger and Shapiro next seek to\ndismiss the evidence commonly put forward by proponents of multiple\nrealization as arguments for functionalism or realization-physicalism\nover mind-brain identity theory. They first consider \u201cdirect\nevidence\u201d, empirical cases presented as genuine instances of\nmultiple realization of the mental on the physical. One type is\n\u201ccortical functional plasticity\u201d, in both\n\u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d varieties. A\n\u201ccommon\u201d kind is cortical reorganization, where neurons in\na specific cortical region take on a new function following damage to\nnerves or axons providing their normal input. A more\n\u201cradical\u201d variety is exemplified by the well-known work in\ndeveloping ferrets, in which retinal projections were redirected to\nthe medial, rather than the lateral geniculate nucleus in the\nthalamus, and hence retinal input was projected to auditory, rather\nthan visual cortex (see the discussion of Shapiro 2008 in\n \u00a73.2\n above). Polger and Shapiro argue that both of these varieties fail to\nmeet at least one condition of their Official Recipe, so neither\ncounts as a genuine instance of mental-to-physical multiple\nrealization. The \u201ccommon\u201d case involves change in\nfunction\u2014in the specific example, neuronal activity in the\nreorganized region of primate somatosensory cortex now represents\nstimulation to a different region of the monkey\u2019s hand. In the\n\u201cradical\u201d ferret rewiring case, the visual capacities of\nthe experimental ferrets\u2019 auditory cortex, compared to those of\nintact control ferrets, differ significantly, e.g., the experimental\nferrets show significantly deficient performances on visual\ndiscrimination tasks compared with controls\u2019 performances.\n\nA second kind of direct evidence that Polger and Shapiro consider is\nkind splitting in scientific practice. Again, their Official Recipe\nfigures into their response. They reformulate Aizawa and\nGillett\u2019s (2011) key example, the variations in cone opsins in\nhuman color vision (see discussion in\n \u00a73.1\n above) into Official Recipe format, and deny that it is a case of\ngenuine multiple realization. The cited differences among the opsins\nare not distinct from individual differences among those possessing\nhuman trichromatic color vision, violating one condition of the\nOfficial Recipe.\n\nPolger and Shapiro then extend their discussion of evidence to\nconsider two \u201cindirect\u201d kinds for mental-to-physical\nmultiple realizability. This evidence seeks to show that, in\nlight of various observations, the multiple realizability\nhypothesis is more likely to be true than the mind-brain identity\nhypothesis. They begin by offering a canonical form for indirect\nevidence arguments, which compares the likelihood of multiple\nrealizability versus the unlikelihood of mind-brain identities in\nlight of the evidence. They then recast Block and Fodor\u2019s (1972)\nappeal to neural plasticity (see discussion in\n \u00a71.3\n above), an appeal to evolutionary convergence of psychological states\nand processes, and an appeal to the \u201cconceptual\npossibility\u201d of artificial minds into this canonical form, and\nargue that all three arguments fail. Finally they consider an appeal\nto the prevalence of the \u201ccomputational theory of mind\u201d\nwithin current cognitive science and psychology as an indirect\nargument for multiple realizability. In agreement with some recent\nmechanists (e.g., Kaplan and Craver 2011), Polger and Shapiro insist\nthat many \u201ccomputational explanations\u201d are better\nunderstood \u201cas precise descriptions of the task or behavior to\nbe explained\u201d rather than as explanations (2016: 154). And while\nthey admit that the \u201crepresentationalist\u201d variety of\ncomputationalism (of which Fodor\u2019s 1975 Language of Thought is a\nparadigmatic example) does rule out the possibility of mind-brain\nidentities, they point out that this kind of computationalism is\n\u201cnot the only game in town\u201d anymore (2016: 158). Numerous\nviable competing alternatives to it exist\u2014Polger and Shapiro\nmention connectionism, strong and \u201cruthless\u201d reductionism,\nand mechanism explicitly in this context\u2014and all those make room\nfor mind-brain identities.\n\nPolger and Shapiro wrap up the book by absolving their identity\ntheory, which rests on their treatment of multiple realizability, of\nsome mistaken charges. They argue that their account is not\nontologically eliminativist about psychological kinds, because none of\ntheir three types of arguments against multiple\nrealization\u2014\u201cunificationist\u201d arguments which find\nrelevant commonalities in the realizing kinds, \u201cheuristic,\nabstraction, and idealization\u201d arguments that characterize\npractices in contemporary cognitive science, and their plump for\ntaxonomic \u201ckind splitting\u201d\u2014leads to any kind of\ntroubling eliminativist conclusion. And by adopting James\nWoodward\u2019s (2003) \u201cinterventionist\ndifference-making\u201d account of causal explanation, Polger and\nShapiro deflect the charge that their identity theory undermines the\nlegitimacy of psychological explanations, and thus rules out any\nautonomy for psychology vis-\u00e0-vis neuroscience. Such a charge, they\ninsist, rests on an overly stringent and misguided understanding of\nscientific explanation. Identity theorists can be and should be\npluralists about scientific explanation. Neuroscientists can appeal to\nneural causes, psychologists and cognitive scientists to mental\ncauses. Since both can cite causal invariances at their respective\nlevels, both offer genuine explanations. Despite the mind-brain\nidentities, psychology remains a methodologically autonomous science.\n(Their defense of psychology\u2019s autonomy resembles\nWoodward\u2019s recent more general defense of a general kind of\nexplanatory autonomy, see Woodward forthcoming.)\n\nWe have dwelled in some detail on Polger and Shapiro\u2019s (2016)\nbook because of its scope and the unifying focus it offers for\nphilosophical discussions of multiple realization, both historical and\nrecent. Similarly, initial criticisms of the book ranged from ones\nsquarely in philosophy of mind, to others aimed at more broadly\nmetaphysics of science considerations. Not surprisingly, given that\nthe book defends a version of mind-brain identity theory, which has\nbeen considered indefensible, or at best fringe, for some time, it met\nwith rapid criticism from philosophers of mind. Ronald Endicott (2017)\ntakes Polger and Shapiro to task for offering few (if any) examples of\nexplicit mind-brain identities. Endicott\u2019s criticism is fair\nenough, in one sense. Polger and Shapiro nowhere attempt to catalogue\nor discuss specific identity claims. Neither, of course, did U.T.\nPlace or J.J.C. Smart in their seminal works first defending the view;\nbut those works were published sixty or more years ago, and\nneuroscience has progressed rapidly over that time. Polger and Shapiro\ndo criticize numerous claims to have found multiple realization of\nmind on brain, so perhaps those discussions can serve implicitly as\nmind-brain identity claims. But circa 2016, one reasonably could have\nhoped for some examples of specific mind-brain identities, and a\ndefense of the evidence that supports them.\n\nUmut Baysan (2018) raises two challenges. His first is squarely within\nphilosophy of mind. He contends that Polger and Shapiro change\n\u201cthe rules of the game\u201d over which functionalists/realization physicalists and identity theorists are disputing. Polger\nand Shapiro saddle the former with defending a general hypothesis,\ni.e., all psychological kinds are functional kinds or realized kinds;\nwhile identity theorists seek only to defend a far weaker existential\nclaim, i.e., that there are some instances of mind-brain identities.\nSecond, and more generally, Baysan takes Polger and Shapiro to task\nfor limiting their concern to the empirical hypothesis, multiple\nrealization, and refusing to speak to concerns about metaphysically\npossible realizers of mental kinds, or multiple realizability. Baysan\ninsists that some philosophers are still concerned with the latter,\nand a work that purports to be a book-length treatment of the general\ntopic will leave these philosophers justifiably disappointed. On the\nfirst point, Baysan is right that Polger and Shapiro do seek to\nreorient this fifty-year-old debate, and they characterize\nfunctionalism and realization physicalism as quite general hypotheses.\nBut Baysan\u2019s account of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s weakened\nidentity theory seems to miss the point of their explicit\nreformulation of the multiple realization problem, into first and\nforemost the question, \n\n\ndoes the best overall model of psychological and neuroscientific\nprocesses make substantial and important use of identities? (Polger\nand Shapiro 2016: 34) \n\n\nThat reformulated focus requires a much stronger defense than does\nBaysan\u2019s existential hypothesis interpretation of their identity\ntheory. By it Polger and Shapiro are committed to arguing that\nidentity theory provides \u201cthe best overall model\u201d of\npsychology\u2019s relationship to neuroscience. (Whether they succeed\nin making this argument is a separate issue.) And as far as a need to\ndiscuss metaphysical possibilities, and hence multiple realizability\nin the sense that some philosophers understand it, that depends on who\none takes one\u2019s audience to be. If one is concerned strictly\nabout multiple realization as a part of the philosophy of the special\nsciences\u2014as some discussants of multiple realization\nare\u2014metaphysical possibilities and realizations of the mental in\n\u201cmetaphysically possible worlds\u201d can strike one as\nphilosophical jibber-jabber, the kind of discussions that give\nphilosophy a bad name within broader twenty-first-century intellectual\ncontexts. Curiously, however, Polger and Shapiro seem not to want to\ntake that extreme a position. They locate their work squarely in the\nmetaphysics of science, not strictly in philosophy of science\nor metascience. Does that leave them open to the charge of needing to\nconsider at least some metaphysical possibilities, and so some kinds\nof multiple realizability? We will turn to this problem later\nin this section, in light of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s replies to\nother criticisms.\n\nDanny Booth (2018) is sympathetic to Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\nbroader project, and to their conclusion about the importance of\nmind-brain identities in contemporary cognitive science. But he\nworries about their deference to scientists concerning how mental\nkinds are individuated, and thus identified across distinct physical\nrealizations, as their Official Recipe for multiple realization\nproposes. He points out that many scientists view questions about\nmental kind individuation as \u201cphilosophical\u201d, and so punt\nthis concern back to philosophers. Scientists also sometimes\nindividuate mental kinds on quite narrow grounds; Booth here cites\nJacqueline Sullivan\u2019s recent discussions of the difficulty of\nidentifying mental kinds across neuroscience labs that employ\ndifferent protocols (see discussion of Sullivan\u2019s work in the\n\u201cPhilosophy of Neuroscience\u201d entry, this encyclopedia).\nSometimes they do so purely on behavioral grounds which operationalize\nmental kinds for laboratory experimentation. The latter approach flies\ndirectly in the face of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s explicit rejection\nof mental kind identity in their Official Recipe for multiple\nrealization. Booth also worries about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s more\ngeneral appeal to an interventionist account of causation to salvage\n\u201cactual\u201d autonomy for psychology. Nothing stops\nfunctionalists or realization physicalists from adopting a similar\napproach to saving psychology\u2019s autonomy, and in fact many avail\nthemselves of this approach. Booth worries that \n\n\nthis leaves very little that distinguishes Modest Identity Theory from\nmore traditional versions of functionalism. (2018: 440) \n\n\nThat Polger and Shapiro\u2019s view shares more points in common with\ntraditional functionalism than with traditionally\n\u201creductionist\u201d versions of identity theory leaves Booth\nwondering whether Polger and Shapiro\u2019s account itself faces some\nof the same challenges they direct at functionalism. \n\nMark Couch (2018) worries about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s general\ncharacterization of multiple realization in terms of the taxonomies\noffered by different sciences, as opposed to more typical accounts in\nterms of properties or kinds in the world. About this shift, Couch\nfirst points out that scientists in any given field aren\u2019t\nalways in agreement about how to taxonomize the phenomena they\naddress. So appealing to \u201cscientists\u2019 taxonomies\u201d\nmight not be sufficient, and philosophers might be forced back to\nconsidering \u201cindependently existing kinds\u201d (2018: 421).\nPolger and Shapiro\u2019s refocused account also might not address\nwhat has interested philosophers about multiple realization, namely,\nconcerns about metaphysical relations holding between independently\nexisting properties and kinds; independent, that is, of any taxonomic\npractices. This leads Couch to worry about Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\naccount of \u201crelevant differences\u201d in their \u201cOfficial\nRecipe\u201d, especially their account of how we decide when this\ncondition has been met. He senses an internal tension lurking here. On\nthe one hand, \n\n\nthe sciences that deal with the putative realizers tell us which\ndifferences in them amount to different ways of producing their\neffects and which do not. (Polger and Shapiro 2016: 62) \n\n\nBut this \u201cofficial view\u201d seems at odds with a second\n\u201cunofficial\u201d way Polger and Shapiro cash \u201crelevant\ndifferences\u201d: \u201ca matter of whether a property has an\nexplanatory role with respect to a function\u201d (Couch 2018: 424).\nThis \u201cunofficial\u201d understanding, Couch insists, sees\nrelevance as an explanatory relation between properties or kinds in\nnature, and thus not merely a matter of what scientists \u201ctell\nus\u201d. These two readings of \u201crelevant differences\u201d\nstrike Couch as making it unclear how the Official Recipe will apply\nto Polger\u2019s and Shapiro\u2019s own examples of multiple\nrealized kinds.\n\nIn contrast with Booth and Couch, who challenges Polger and Shapiro\nfor deferring too much to scientists and their taxonomies, Mazviita\nChirimuuta chides them for not paying enough attention to actual\n\u201cfunctional thinking\u201d in the life sciences, and thus\nrelying too heavily on \u201ctoy examples\u201d like corkscrews.\nChirimuuta agrees with Polger and Shapiro that the old\nphilosophers\u2019 notion of multiple realization,\n\u201cMR1.0\u201d, needs replacing, but suggests looking directly\ninto three areas of the life sciences for its replacement,\n\u201cMR2.0\u201d. One area is evolutionary approaches, where\nChirimuuta mentions explicitly Ernst Mayr\u2019s proximate/ultimate\nexplanation distinction, the latter referring to the evolutionary\nfunction or \u201cpurpose\u201d of a behavior, and so serves as a\n\u201cnecessary, non-replaceable completement\u201d of the former\n(2018: 407). The second area is reverse engineering, which posits a\nfunction in the nervous system and then works back to see how the\nphysical components perform it. The third area is the study of\nrobustness in biological systems, whereby the function of a system is\nmaintained despite alterations in lower-level mechanisms. Chirimuuta\nnotes that Criterion IV (the \u201cdifferently the same\u201d\ncondition mentioned above) of Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\n\u201cOfficial Recipe\u201d for genuine multiple realization would\nprobably preclude many cases of biological robustness, in the same\nfashion Polger and Shapiro used it to rule out the\n\u201cradical\u201d ferret rewiring example (discussed above). But\nfor Chirimuuta, this consequence suggests that Polger and\nShapiro\u2019s \u201cOfficial Recipe\u201d may be \u201cmissing\nsomething interesting about the organization of living systems\u201d\n(2018: 408); and so may not be sensitive enough to real scientific\npractice. She notes that for all their talk about relying on\nscientists\u2019 judgments and taxonomies, Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\nfavorite \u201ctoy example\u201d, the corkscrew, comes up a lot when\nthe conditions on genuine multiple realization are being articulated\nand defended. Her point is that a closer look at some real sciences\nthat engage in functional thinking, at the point when Polger and\nShapiro are developing and defending their basic analysis of multiple\nrealization, might have generated a different account of what multiple\nrealization is (\u201cMR2.0\u201d). As opposed to what Polger and\nShapiro actually do with real scientific examples, namely bring them\nup to debunk claims about successful multiple realization based on\ntheir already existing detailed analysis. Such an approach seemingly\nwould have produced an account tied much more closely to actual\nscientific practice.\n\nIn their (2018) Polger and Shapiro respond to these criticisms. They\nbegin by clarifying what they call a common misconception of their\nview (and not just among these critics), that they don\u2019t take\nseriously multiple realizability. They claim they do, but\nthey insist that even these metaphysical concerns \u201care not\nimmune from evidential demands\u201d (2018: 448). The best evidence\nfor multiple realizability would be widespread instances of\nmultiple realization; but this, as they argued extensively in\ntheir (2016), is exactly what is lacking. Other kinds of evidence for\nmultiple realizability include equipotentiality, evolutionary\nconvergence, and computational explanations in the relevant sciences,\nbut Polger and Shapiro insist that they have argued in their book that\nthese kinds of evidence are lacking, too.\n\nThey then take up the two criticisms, one from both Booth and Couch,\nthe other from Chirimuuta, which pull in opposite directions\nconcerning their dependence on science. Booth and Couch both insisted\nthat Polger and Shapiro rely too heavily on taxonomies postulated by\nscientists to characterize genuine instances of multiple realization.\nPolger and Shapiro take both Booth\u2019s and Couch\u2019s worry to\nbe that their approach thereby shackles their account to \u201cthe\nwhim of scientists\u201d (2018: 449). They remind us that by\n\u201ctaxonomy\u201d they refer to \u201cwhatever a particular\nscience views as belonging within its domain\u201d (2018: 449). The\nsciences themselves provide those; the best evidence we can have for\nany science\u2019s \u201contological commitments\u201d are\n\u201cthe taxonomic representations and models that it uses\u201d\n(2018: 450). Both Polger and Shapiro, and their multiple realization\nproponents, are assuming that the relevant sciences track real\ndistinctions in the world. Polger and Shapiro agree that sciences can\nand do mischaracterize these, but \u201cthat problem has to do with\nthe fallibility of evidence and not with our account of multiple\nrealization\u201d (2018: 450). Polger and Shapiro also admit that\ntheir reference to the notion of taxonomies has not always been clear;\nbut nevertheless appealing to scientific taxonomies as a form of\nevidence for multiple realization is useful. Their focus on scientific\ntaxonomies is thus not incompatible with more traditional\nphilosophical discussions about multiple realization.\n\nThey then turn to Chirimuuta\u2019s contrary criticism, that in\ndeveloping their account of multiple realization they ignore\n\u201cfunctional thinking\u201d in real biology and neuroscience.\nThey begin by focusing on one of Chirimuuta\u2019s claims, that \n\n\nfunctional classifications capture regularities not apparent when\ndescription is restricted to more fine-grained vocabulary (be it\nphysical, chemical, or neuroanatomical), \n\n\nwith these classifications thus averting us to the \u201climitations\nof purely reductive research agendas in biology and\nneuroscience\u201d (Chirimuuta 2018: 409). If Chirimuuta is here\nadvocating pluralism about scientific explanation, Polger and Shapiro\nare in full agreement; they are avowed methodological pluralists. But\nif Chirimuuta is here advocating some kind of \u201cEssential\nAutonomy Thesis\u201d, that higher-level regularities are\n\u201csomehow invisible\u201d to would-be reducing explanations, or\n\u201ccan only be captured in the proprietary vocabulary of a special\nscience\u201d, then Chirimuuta\u2019s MR2.0 sounds suspiciously like\nMR1.0, with the latter being a view she herself insists needs to be\nrejected. They then insist that Chirimuuta\u2019s own discussion of\nthe role of functional thinking in biology and neuroscience stresses\nits methodological importance. Again, Polger and Shapiro have\nno complaint about that. Their critical focus is on an inference from\nthis pluralist methodology and the ability to model a system in this\nfashion to the conclusion that the system is ipso facto\nmultiply realizable\u201d (2018: 454\u2013455). Being a fellow\nrejecter of MR1.0 and its accompanying Essential Autonomy Thesis,\nPolger and Shapiro insist that Chirimuuta should also reject any such\ninference.\n\nIn closing this section, it should be clear that the extension of\nphilosophical discussions about multiple realization, which began with\nthe \u201csecond-wave\u201d of criticisms around the year 2000,\ncontinues apace. The specific philosophical arena in which these\ndiscussions take place continues to expand, from the topic\u2019s\norigins in mid-twentieth century philosophy of mind through its\nturn-of-the millennium path into the philosophy of the cognitive\nsciences and neuroscience, and lately more squarely in the general\nmetaphysics of science. These shifts can make the details of the\nevolving discussions difficult to track. Polger and Shapiro\u2019s\n(2016) book, and the critical scrutiny across all of these fields that\nit spurred, provides a useful framework for organizing these many\ndirections, despite what one judges about its skepticism about the\nextent of multiple realization and its defense of a mind-brain\nidentity theory. The literature over the last twenty years should put\nto rest the still-too-prominent view in the philosophy of mind that\nmultiple realization spells doom for reductive materialism and\nmind-brain identity theory once and for all, as well as the\nstill-too-prominent view in some quarters in philosophy of science\nthat multiple realization, or at least its anti-reductionist\nconsequences, has been vanquished for good. Both views look uninformed\nand badly outdated in light of the detailed history of multiple\nrealization, a history which now spans more than a half-century of\nAnglo-American philosophy.\n",
