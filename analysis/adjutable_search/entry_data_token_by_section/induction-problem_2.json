Tackling the First Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma\n\nThe first horn of Hume\u2019s argument, as formulated above, is aimed\nat establishing that there is no demonstrative argument for the UP.\nThere are several ways people have attempted to show that the first\nhorn does not definitively preclude a demonstrative or a\npriori argument for inductive inferences. One possible escape\nroute from the first horn is to deny\n premise P3,\n which amounts to admitting the possibility of synthetic a\npriori propositions\n (section 3.1).\n Another possibility is to attempt to provide an a priori\nargument that the conclusion of the inference is probable, though not\ncertain. The first horn of Hume\u2019s dilemma implies that there\ncannot be a demonstrative argument to the conclusion of an inductive\ninference because it is possible to conceive of the negation of the\nconclusion. For instance, it is quite possible to imagine that the\nnext piece of bread I eat will poison me rather than nourish me.\nHowever, this does not rule out the possibility of a demonstrative\nargument that establishes only that the bread is highly likely to\nnourish, not that it definitely will. One might then also challenge\n premise P8,\n by saying that it is not necessary for justification of an inductive\ninference to have a chain of reasoning from its premises to its\nconclusion. Rather it would suffice if we had an argument from the\npremises to the claim that the conclusion is probable or likely. Then\nan a priori justification of the inductive inference would\nhave been provided. There have been attempts to provide a\npriori justifications for inductive inference based on Inference\nto the Best Explanation\n (section 3.2).\n There are also attempts to find an a priori solution based\non probabilistic formulations of inductive inference, though many now\nthink that a purely a priori argument cannot be found because\nthere are empirical assumptions involved (sections\n 3.3\n -3.5).\n",
