    "main_text": "Logic and Semantics || The Summa of Logic\n3.1 The Summa of Logic\n\nOckham\u2019s Summa of Logic is divided into three parts,\nwith the third part subdivided into four subparts. Part I divides\nlanguage, in accordance with Aristotle\u2019s On\nInterpretation (1, 16a3\u20138, as influenced by\nBoethius\u2019s interpretation), into written, spoken and mental\nlanguage, with the written kind dependent on the spoken, and the\nspoken on mental language. Mental language, the language of thought,\nis thus the most primitive and basic level of language. Part I goes on\nto lay out a fairly detailed theory of terms, including the\ndistinctions between (a) categorematic and syncategorematic terms, (b)\nabstract and concrete terms, and (c) absolute and connotative terms.\nPart I then concludes with a discussion of the five\n\u201cpredicables\u201d from Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nof each of Aristotle\u2019s categories.\n\nWhile Part I is about terms, Part II is about\n\u201cpropositions,\u201d which are made up of terms. Part II gives\na systematic and nuanced theory of truth conditions for the four\ntraditional kinds of assertoric categorical propositions on the\n\u201cSquare of Opposition,\u201d and then goes on to tensed, modal\nand more complicated categorical propositions, as well as a variety of\n\u201chypothetical\u201d\n (molecular[13])\n propositions. The vehicle for this account of truth conditions is the\nsemantic theory of \u201csupposition,\u201d which will be treated\nbelow.\n\nIf Part I is about terms and Part II about propositions made up of\nterms, Part III is about arguments, which are in turn made up of\npropositions made up of terms. It is divided into four subparts. Part\nIII.1 treats syllogisms, and includes a comprehensive theory of modal\n syllogistic.[14]\n Part III.2 concerns demonstrative syllogisms in particular. Part\nIII.3 is in effect Ockham\u2019s theory of consequence, although it\nalso includes discussions of semantic paradoxes like the Liar (the so\ncalled insolubilia) and of the still little-understood\ndisputation form known as \u201cobligation.\u201d Part III.4 is a\ndiscussion of fallacies.\n\nThus, while the Summa of Logic is not in any sense a\n\u201ccommentary\u201d on Aristotle\u2019s logical writings, it\nnevertheless covers all the traditional ground in the traditional\norder: Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories in Part I, On Interpretation in Part II,\nPrior Analytics in Part III.1, Posterior Analytics\nin Part III.2, Topics (and much else) in Part III.3, and\nfinally Sophistic Refutations in Part III.4.\n",
