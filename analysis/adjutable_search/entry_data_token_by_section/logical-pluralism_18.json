    "main_text": "Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism || Pluralism by Restriction\n5.5 Pluralism by Restriction\n\nFinally, Hjortland explores another kind of logical pluralism in\ndefending sub-classical logics from Williamson\u2019s abductive\nargument that classical logic is the One True Logic (Hjortland 2017:\n652\u2013657; Williamson 2017; see Blake-Turner 2020 and L. Shapiro\n2022 for discussion). Consider the claim that the ubiquitous use of\nclassical logic (rather than other weaker logics) in\nmathematics is a strong point in its favour. If we had to give up\nclassical logic, we might be worried about losing a lot of elegant,\nsimple and otherwise virtuous mathematical theories. But preserving\nvirtuous theories, and letting go of ad hoc and otherwise\nvicious theories, is what the abductive approach in logic is all\nabout.\n\nHowever, the move from the importance of classical logic in\nmathematics to the truth of classical logic is much too fast. It is\none thing to say that classical logic, including say, instances of the\nprinciples of Double Negation Elimination (DNE) and Disjunctive\nSyllogism (DS), are widely used in mathematics. But mathematics does\nnot require any principles with the full strength and generality of\nclassical logic\u2019s DNE and DS\u2014it only uses some of the\ninstances of those principles, the instances that employ\nmathematical language. When we say that DNE and DS are\nlogically valid we are saying that they are valid no matter\nwhat expressions we substitute for the non-logical expressions in\nthem\u2014including extra-mathematical vague predicates like\n\u201cheap\u201d or \u201cred\u201d, and notoriously troublesome\nmetalinguistic predicates like \u201ctrue\u201d and\n\u201cheterological\u201d.\n\n\nMathematical proofs do contain an abundance of instances of classical\nprinciples: applications of classical reductio ad absurdum,\nconditional proof, disjunctive syllogism, the law of absorption, etc.\nThe emphasis, however, should be on the fact that these are instances\nof classical principles. The mathematical proofs do not rely on any of\nthese principles being unrestricted generalisations of the form that\nWilliamson defends. They do at most rely on the principles holding\nrestrictedly for mathematical discourse, which does not entail that\nthe principles of reasoning hold universally. Put differently,\nmathematical practice is consistent with these reasoning steps being\ninstances of mathematical principles of reasoning, not generalisable\nto all other discourses. A fortiori, they may very well be\nprinciples of reasoning that are permissible for mathematics, but not\nfor theorizing about truth. (Hjortland 2017: 652\u2013653) \n\n\nThat leaves space for a kind of pluralism that holds that some of the\nstronger logical principles are correct only when they are restricted\nto particular kinds of linguistic expression (such as those that\nfeature in the language of Peano Arithmetic); if we don\u2019t\nrestrict them in this way, there will be counterexamples. Other\nlogical principles (perhaps conjunction elimination is on this list)\ndo not need to be restricted to the language of Peano Arithmetic. This\nleaves us with a sense in which we have different correct logics,\ndepending on which language we are assuming.\n",
