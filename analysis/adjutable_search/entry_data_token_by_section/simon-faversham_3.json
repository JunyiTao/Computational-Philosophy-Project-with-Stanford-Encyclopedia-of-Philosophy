    "main_text": "Logic || Signification\n3.2 Signification\n\nSimon also joins in the medieval discussion of the signification of\nwords\u2014whether they signify things or thoughts\u2014a discussion\nprompted by Aristotle\u2019s claim in the first chapter of the De\ninterpretatione that words signify thoughts. Simon clearly\nopposes the Boethian tradition, which defends the immediate\nsignification of thoughts, and sides with those who claim that words\nsignify\n things.[6]\n\nFollowing a division first attested in Porphyry, Simon divides words\ninto first and second imposition. Words of first imposition are given\nas names of quiddities, which have being independently of a knowing\nsubject. Words of second imposition are given as names of logical\nintentions, the being of which depends on a knowing subject. Words of\nsecond imposition clearly signify thoughts, so the controversy does\nnot concern them. Rather, it concerns words of first imposition, such\nas \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018stone\u2019.\n\nFor Simon, words of first imposition do not signify a thought but a\nquiddity. His argument goes as follows:\n\n \u2018x\u2019 signifies x if and only if\n\u2018x\u2019 provokes the thought of x in the listener\nand expresses the thought of x in the speaker. (Cf.\nDe int. 1 and 3)\n \u2018man\u2019 does not provoke the thought of the thought of\nman in the listener, nor does it express the thought of the thought of\nman in the speaker. If it did, real predicates such as\n\u2018run\u2019 could not be verified of any man because obviously\nthe act of running cannot be attributed to the thought of man.\n Therefore, \u2018man\u2019 does not signify the thought of man;\nand generally, \u2018x\u2019 does not signify the thought of\nx.\n On the contrary, \u2018man\u2019 provokes the thought of man in\nthe listener and expresses the thought of man in the speaker.\n Therefore, \u2018man\u2019 signifies man; and generally,\n\u2018x\u2019 signifies x\u2014a quiddity.\n\n\nIt is remarkable that, in Simon\u2019s view, \u2018x\u2019\nsignifies x only if both the expression-condition for the\nspeaker and the comprehension-condition for the listener are met. This\ndouble condition for signification, typical of the last quarter of the\nthirteenth century, represents a break with respect to the more\nexpression-oriented notion of signification common in the second and\nthird quarters of the century (Marmo 1999). \n\nNow, following the Avicennian idea that being\u2014mental or\nactual\u2014is an accident of essences, Simon also makes clear that\n\u2018x\u2019 does not signify quiddities according to their\nexistence in the external world. In other words, \u2018man\u2019\ndoes not signify a particular man, but man as a quiddity. This part of\nthe argument goes as follows:\n\n \u2018x\u2019 signifies the same thing the definition of\n\u2018x\u2019 signifies.\n The definition of \u2018x\u2019 does not signify a particular\nthing, but a thing only with regard to its essential features and\nregardless of accidents such as external or mental existence.\n Therefore, \u2018x\u2019 does not signify a particular\nx, but x with regard to its essential features and\nregardless of accidents such as external or mental existence.\n\n\nConsequently, Simon also holds that words of first imposition the\nreferents of which are all destroyed do not lose their signification,\nbecause, for a word to signify, its significate\u2014the\nquiddity\u2014simply needs to be thought, and a quiddity can continue\nto be thought even after the destruction of all its instances.\n",
