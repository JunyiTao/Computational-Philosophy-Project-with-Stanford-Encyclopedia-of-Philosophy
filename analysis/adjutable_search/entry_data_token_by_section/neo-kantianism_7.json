    "main_text": "The Southwest School || Theory of Knowledge\n3.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThere are four fundamental features of the SW Neo-Kantians\u2019\ntheory of knowledge: a normative theory of objectivity and objecthood;\nthe act/content/object distinction; the rejection of the copy theory\nof knowledge; and a theory of what is given in perceptual experience.\nThis section addresses each of these features in turn.\nObjectivity and Objecthood\n\nThe central question that Rickert poses in his The Object of\nKnowledge, which is the most developed and thorough SW work in\nthe theory of knowledge, is \u201cWhat is the object of knowledge,\nwhich is independent of the subject, or in virtue of what does\ncognizing achieve objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1915: 1). In\nparticular, Rickert is concerned with the \u201ctranscendence\u201d\nof the object: that the object is an independent standard for\nknowledge, that it determines whether knowledge is true or objective.\nRickert\u2019s answer to these questions is that the object is a\n\u201ctranscendent ought\u201d [Sollen], and not\nfundamentally a \u201ctranscendent being\u201d [Sein] or\n\u201creality\u201d [Wirklichkeit]. This is a distinctive\nview. It is, of course, a platitude that objects are normative in the\nsense that our beliefs about an object ought to be true of it. But a\ncommon view is that this normativity is derivative: our beliefs about\nan object ought to be a certain way, because the object\nitself is a certain way. On this common view, the\nobject\u2019s standing as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d is\ngrounded in its \u201ctranscendent being\u201d. Rickert rejects this\nview. He argues that the only norms that can be derived from what is\n[sein], are conditional norms, to the effect that one ought\nto do such and such if one happens to will a certain thing\u2014norms\nthat are neither objective, nor independent of the subject. Such a\nview either undermines the theory of knowledge as a normative\ndiscipline (and truth as a value), or undermines objectivity (Rickert\n1915: 281). Rickert therefore advocates upending the common view. He\ntakes norms of cognition as basic and irreducible, and argues that the\ntranscendent reality of objects is grounded in these irreducible\ncognitive norms.\n\nIn Lask 1911 and Lask 1912, Lask follows his teacher in talking of the\nobject as \u201ccontaining a value\u201d or being the standard for\nknowledge. Drawing on Rickert\u2019s ideas, he argues that the\nobjectivity (of an object) is just the same thing as validity (of\nvalues), and that both objects and senses share this form.\nNevertheless, Lask departs from Rickert\u2019s view in two ways.\nFirst, he argues that \n\n\nas we must fight every version of truth that is characterized by\nmirroring and shadowing, so also conversely, we must fight any\nassertion of a dependence in the opposite direction, a priority of\ntheoretical validity, of the \u201cdemand\u201d, of the\n\u201cought\u201d before being. (Lask 1911: 410) \n\n\nThe transcendent being of an object is no more derivative from the\nnormativity of our claims about that object than the latter is on the\nformer (Lask 1908). Second, Lask argues that the object has a form and\na matter, and that the form alone is what is valid. Thus the object is\nnot itself a transcendent ought, but only its form\n is.[21]\nAct, Content, and Object of Thinking\n\nLotze had distinguished psychology from the theory of knowledge (what\nLotze calls \u201clogic\u201d) by distinguishing the acts of\nthinking, which are events and constitute the subject matter of\npsychology, from the contents of thinking, which are valid and\nconstitute the subject matter of logic (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x;\n\u00a7332). This distinction was taken up and ramified by Rickert and\nLask. Starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of\nKnowledge, Rickert argued that the content [Gehalt] of a\njudgment had to be split up into two parts: the unreal\n[unwirklich], objective content [Gehalt], and the\nsubjective, \u201cimmanent sense\u201d [Urteilssinn] of the\njudgment. This immanent sense is distinct from the act of judging,\nwhich is \u201creal\u201d and the subject matter of psychology.\nRickert calls the immanent sense \u201cirreal\u201d\n[irreal]. The immanent sense is the orienting of the subject\ntoward the objective content (Rickert 1915: 164\u2013167; Ch.3,\n\u00a74). What Rickert means by this can be brought out by contrasting\nit with the objective content, which Rickert takes to be a whole\ncomposed of connected representations. For example, the three\nsentences \u201cIs snow white?\u201d, \u201cSnow is white\u201d,\nand \u201cSnow is not white\u201d, for Rickert all have the same\nobjective content, since in all three the same representation\n(\u201cwhite\u201d) is predicated categorically of the same\nrepresentation (\u201csnow\u201d). The difference is in the\n\u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the sentences: the first sentence\nquestions whether the content is true, the second\naffirms that the content is true, and the third\ndenies that the content is true (Rickert 1915: 175; Ch.3,\n\u00a76). Rickert\u2019s distinction between immanent sense and\nobjective content fits more naturally than does the simple act/content\ndistinction with the SW conception of philosophy as the theory of\nvalues, and thus with their conception of the theory of knowledge as\nconcerned with the norm of truth. After all, if theory of\nknowledge is concerned only with abstract, objective contents, then it\nis not clear why it would be any more normative than natural science.\nA science that isolates the laws of abstract things would seem just as\ndescriptive as a science that isolates the laws of concrete\nthings\u2014as Husserl argued forcefully in Logical\nInvestigations (Husserl 1900). Norms seem more suited for acts,\nnot objective contents. But to swing in the opposite direction, and\ntake theory of knowledge to concern acts of cognition wouldn\u2019t\nhelp either, since the laws that govern the acts are just descriptive\nlaws that predict what a psychophysical subject will think under\ncertain circumstances. The theory of knowledge, however, can be\nnormative if it concerns the element intermediate between acts and\nobjective contents: it gives the norms for immanent senses, stances\ntaken toward objective contents.\n\nA different kind of refinement of the act/content/object distinction\nappears in Lask\u2019s 1912 Die Lehre vom Urteil (The\nDoctrine of\n Judgment).[22]\n Lask wants a theory of judgment that recognizes that the object is\nthe standard of truth; and that truth does not depend on the act of\njudging\u2014just as anti-psychologism demands. Lask believes that\nthe standard distinctions between act, content, and object do not\nfully recognize this. In particular, he rejects Rickert\u2019s view\nthat, in judging, a subject takes a stance with respect to the\nobjective content. This is because Lask believes that the objective\ncontent is created by the act of judging, and so Rickert\u2019s view\nhas the unpalatable consequence that our acts of judging are about\nsomething that is created by our acts of judgment, thus violating the\nidea that our judgments answer to something prior to the act of\njudging. On the other hand, he cannot say that in judging, we judge\nthe object itself, since all judgments have a structure (one thing is\npredicated of another), and the object, he argues, is an unstructured\nwhole whose articulation into parts is a work of the mind. Lask\ntherefore posits, in addition to the content of the judgment and the\nobject itself, a third thing, which he calls the \u201cprimary\nobject\u201d (Lask 1912: Ch.1). The primary object is a structured\nwhole, which (as structured) is distinct from the object itself, but\n(as structured in a way that differs from the logical structures\npossessed by judgments) is distinct from the content of the judgment,\nas well. Judging is then a decision about whether the predication in\nthe primary object is valid, and the content is the thought that the\nprimary object is valid. The judgment thus aims to successfully\n\u201creproduce\u201d or \u201crebuild\u201d [nachbilden]\nin a structured form the originally unstructured object (Lask 1912:\nCh.2, \u00a71), and truth, as the adequate rebuilding of the object,\nbecomes a kind of correspondence (Ch.2,\n \u00a72).[23]\nRejection of the Copy Theory of Knowledge\n\nAnother idea, present in Lotze, though ultimately derived from Kant,\nis the rejection of the copy theory [Abbildtheorie] of\nknowledge. \u201cSince the Critique of Pure Reason\u201d, Windelband\nwrites, \n\n\nthe days are over once and for all when a mature philosophical\nconsciousness might think of the world as \u201cgiven\u201d and\nmirrored in it, as it would seem to the naive consciousness. In\neverything we regard as given our reason is already at work: and the\njustification of our knowledge of things rests only on our first\ncreating them for ourselves. (1910 [NKR: 318]) \n\n\nNo knowledge, not even perceptual knowledge, is merely receptive, or a\nmirror, but is a product that results from the application of a priori\nforms to what is given. The explicit attack on the copy theory becomes\nmore explicit in Windelband and Rickert\u2019s writings over time:\nstarting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of\nKnowledge, Rickert devotes a section (Chapter 2, section VI)\nexplicitly to attacking the copy theory, and he devotes a late essay\n(Rickert 1934) to what he sees as a revival of the errors of the copy\ntheory in Heidegger. In the latter essay, Rickert attacks\n\u201ctheoretical intuitionism\u201d, the idea that cognition\n[Erkenntnis] is no more than intuition [Anschauung],\na passive reception of the object that is given to us. Such a view\nimplies that cognition is simply a copy of the object, which resembles\nit. However, he argues that intuition, the passive reception of what\nis given, merely gives \u201ckennen\u201d (acquaintance\nwith), and not true \u201cerkennen\u201d (cognizing).\nCognition requires a \u201ccomplete transformation of the given\nintuition through non-intuitive factors\u201d (1934 [NKR: 391]).\nThe Given\n\nThough the SW and Marburg school agree in their rejection of the copy\ntheory, they take very different attitudes toward the distinction\nbetween intuitions and concepts, and toward the \u201cgiven\u201d.\nFor the Marburg school, there is nothing given; the SW School argues\nonly that knowledge is not a copy of the given, but requires a\ntransformation of it. For the Marburg school, there is no distinction\nbetween intuitions and concepts; for the SW School, intuitions are\nirreducible to concepts. These two points are developed by Rickert. He\nholds that the content of a sensory consciousness, what is given in\nperception, is a \u201cheterogeneous continuum\u201d and an\n\u201cunsurveyable manifold\u201d (1915: 406\u20137; Ch.5, \u00a75,\n\u201cKonstitutive Wirklichkeitsformen und Methodologische\nErkenntnisformen\u201d). This multiplicity of content in\nperception can only be felt [Erlebnis, Gef\u00fchl], since it\nwould be an infinite (and so impossible) task to express this content\nin conceptual form (1915: 139; Ch.3, section 1, \u201cDas\nErkennen als Vorstellen\u201d). So cognition cannot be a\nreproduction, or mirror, of what is given; the concept cannot be a\nreproduction of the intuition. Rather, concepts are always general,\nand overcome the multiplicity of the content of sensory consciousness\nby leaving out content that is present in intuition (Rickert 1902:\nCh.1, \u00a71). This idea is further developed by Lask (1911). He\nargues that a theoretical sense (e.g., the sense of this or that\nsentence) is composed of matter and form, that the form of the sense\nis validity, while the matter is the \u201cnon-valid sensible\u201d,\nor \u201calogical content\u201d. This material matter, though it can\nbe taken up into a concept as its matter, is not itself conceptual, or\nreducible or transformable into what is conceptual. The sensible\ncontent (i.e., the content of a sensory consciousness) is\n\u201csomething irrational\u201d or \u201cforeign to\nmeaning\u201d, and can only be passively taken in, felt, and intuited\n(Lask 1911: 415\u2013417; First Part, \u00a73). The sense of a\nsentence does not mirror or copy the sensory given: the sensory given\nis its matter. Lask summarizes the difference between the Marburg view\nand this conception as a distinction between \u201cpanlogicism\u201d\n(the view that all content is conceptual content\u2014the kind of\ncontent that is the subject matter of logic) and \u201cpanarchy of\nlogos\u201d (his view that all content, even sensory content, can be\nthe matter for conceptual form, without being reduced to it) (Lask\n1911: 426; Second Part, Ch.1, \u00a73). \n",
