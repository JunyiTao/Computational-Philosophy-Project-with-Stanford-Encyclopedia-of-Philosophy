    "main_text": "Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition || Summary\n2.5 Summary\n\nObjectivity and simplicity are taken as goals of science, which is\nunderstood to aim at tracking the facts of the world. The\nvalue-ladenness and theory-ladenness of science, however, shows how\ndifficult it is to achieve those goals. While this is true of science\nin general, with animal cognition the stakes are different. Human use\nof animals in food, in medicine, in work, as entertainment, and as\ncompanions raises a host of sometimes conflicting goals that scaffold\nmotivated reasoning and risk implicit bias. The quest for truth about\nanimal capacities relates to an over-arching philosophical theme in\ncomparative cognition: the human-animal divide and the question of the\nextent and areas of continuity between the minds of humans and other\nanimals. This is not a normatively-neutral issue, but rather, the\npicture that science delivers of the human-animal divide can serve to\njustify or undermine the practices that constitute the human-animal\nrelationship. As we will see in\n section 3,\n addressing the biases and philosophical assumptions that shape the\nscience of animal cognition is of great importance for getting things\nright philosophically as well as ethically.\n",
