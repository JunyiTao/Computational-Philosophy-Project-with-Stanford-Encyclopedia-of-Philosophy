    "main_text": "Metaphysics || God's End in Creation\n2.4 God's End in Creation\n\nEdwards never doubted that God's end is himself. Since true virtue\nconsists in benevolence to being and \u201ccomplacence\u201d or\ndelight in moral excellence, and since God is the \u201cchief\npart\u201d of being and the fount of all excellence, a truly virtuous\nagent \u201cmust necessarily have a supreme love to God, both of\nbenevolence and complacence\u201d (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 551). It follows that God's\nrectitude and holiness \u201cchiefly consists in a respect or regard\nto himself, infinitely above his regard to all other beings\u201d and\nthat, as a consequence, his works must be \u201cso wrought as to show\nthis supreme respect to himself\u201d (End of Creation,\n1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 422). God's ultimate aim in all his\nworks must therefore be himself. Edwards concludes that he creates the\nworld for his own glory. But Edwards also believed that because the\nessence of goodness is to communicate good for it own sake,\n\u201chappiness is the end of the creation\u201d\n(\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d no. 3; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 13,\n199).\n\nEnd of Creation reconciles these claims. God's glory is\ndefined as \u201cthe emanation and true external expression of God's\ninternal glory and fullness.\u201d It includes (1) \u201cthe\nexercise of God's perfections to produce a proper effect,\u201d (2)\n\u201cthe manifestation of his internal glory to created\nunderstandings,\u201d (3) \u201cthe communication of the infinite\nfullness of God to the creature,\u201d and (4) \u201cthe creature's\nhigh esteem of God, love to God, and complacence and joy in God; and\nthe proper exercises and expressions of these\u201d (End of\nCreation, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 527).\n\nThere is no ontological distinction between the first and third\n\u201cparts\u201d of God's glory since the principal effect of God's\nexercising his perfections is \u201chis fullness communicated.\u201d\nFurthermore, the third part includes the second and fourth. For God's\ninternal fullness or glory is the \u201cfullness of his understanding\nconsisting in his knowledge\u201d of himself \u201cand the fullness\nof his will consisting in his virtue and happiness.\u201d His\n\u201cexternal glory\u2026consists in the communication of\nthese,\u201d i. e., in bringing it about that \u201cparticular\nminds\u201d know and love God, and delight in him. The four\n\u201cparts\u201d are thus \u201cone thing, in a variety of views\nand relations\u201d (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 8, 527).\n\nIn pursuing his own glory, God thus takes both himself and\nthe creature's good as ultimate aims. Happiness consists in the\nknowledge and love of God, and joy in him. The creature's happiness is\nan ultimate end because it is included in God's ultimate end,\nnamely, the communication of his internal glory \u201cad\nextra;\u201d rather than being a means to God's glory, it is part of\nit.\n\nAn apparent consequence is that God must create a world to\ndisplay his glory. End of Creation contends both that God's\nperfections include \u201ca propensity of nature to diffuse of his\nown fullness\u201d and that it isn't \u201cpossible for him to be\nhindered in the exercise of his goodness and his other perfections in\ntheir proper effect.\u201d (End of Creation, 1765; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 8, 447) It follows that God must diffuse his own\nfullness, i. e., God must create. Edwards also appears committed to\nthe claim that God necessarily creates this world (call it\nw*). God necessarily does what is \u201cfittest and\nbest.\u201d It is thus necessarily true that God creates the best\npossible world. Now God has created w*. Hence, w* is\nthe best possible world. \u2018Being the best possible world\u2019\nis an essential property of whatever world has it, however. It is\ntherefore necessarily true that w* is the best possible\nworld. It follows that it is necessarily true that God creates\nw*.\n\nWhether Edwards was aware of these consequences is uncertain. The two\nmost common objections to them, however, \u2014 that they imply that\nthere isn't any real contingency and that God isn't free \u2014 would\nnot have troubled him. For Edwards thought that our world displays\nneither contra-causal freedom nor real indeterminacy. He also believed\nthat moral agency and freedom are compatible with metaphysical\nnecessity. God can only do what is \u201cfittest and best.\u201d He\nis nevertheless free in the sense that he is aware of alternatives\n(the array of possible worlds), has the ability (i. e., the power and\n\u201cskill\u201d) to actualize any of them, is neither forced,\nconstrained nor influenced by any other being, and does precisely what\nhe wishes. Edwards believes that this is the only kind of freedom that\nis either relevant to moral agency or worth having.\n",
