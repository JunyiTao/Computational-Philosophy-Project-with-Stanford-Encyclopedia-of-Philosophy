    "main_text": "What Makes a Separation Problematic? || Essential Human Nature\n4.2 Essential Human Nature\n\nTo see how the appeal to human nature works, imagine two hypothetical\ntheorists\u2014Katerina and Laura\u2014seeking to assess whether\nalienation exists in a particular society. We can stipulate that the\ninstitutions and culture of this particular society are\nindividualistic\u2014in the sense that they systematically frustrate\ncooperation and sociability\u2014and that the two theorists share\nmany, but not all, of the same views. In particular, assume that our\ntwo theorists agree that: alienation is a coherent and useful\nconcept; the account of alienation given here is, broadly\nspeaking, plausible; the only serious candidate for a problematic\nseparation in this particular society are those arising from its\nindividualism; and our essential human nature provides the\nbenchmark of \u2018propriety\u2019 for assessing separations. Simply\nput, separations are problematic if they frustrate, and unproblematic\nif they facilitate, \u2018self-realisation\u2019. Self-realisation\nis understood here as a central part of the good life and as\nconsisting in the development and deployment of an individual\u2019s\nessential human characteristics. However, assume also that Katerina\nand Laura disagree about what comprises human nature. In\nparticular, they disagree about whether cooperation and sociability\nare essential human characteristics, with Katerina insisting that they\nare and Laura insisting that they are not. It seems to follow that\nKaterina will conclude, and Laura will deny, that this society is one\ncontaining alienation. For Katerina, the widespread lack of\ncooperation and sociability confirm that the basic social institutions\nhere frustrate our self-realisation. For Laura, the very same\nwidespread lack of cooperation and sociability confirm that the basic\nsocial institutions facilitate, or at least do not\nfrustrate, our self-realisation.\n\nNote that in sub-section 1.2, where the basic idea of alienation was\nelaborated, various relations between subject and object were\ndistinguished, only one of which was characterised as reflexive.\nHowever, in the light of the present discussion, we might now think it\nmore accurate to say that\u2014on this kind of account, which\nuses our essential human nature to identify alienation\u2014only\none of them was directly reflexive, because there is some\nsense in which all of those dimensions of alienation involve a\nseparation from some aspect of our own human nature. After all, this\nis precisely what picks out the relevant separation as problematic.\nFor example, the separation of individuals from each other is, for\nKaterina, indirectly also a separation from human nature, from the\ncooperation and sociability that characterises our essential\nhumanity.\n",
