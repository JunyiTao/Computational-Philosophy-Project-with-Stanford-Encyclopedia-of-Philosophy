    "main_text": "The Question of Justification || Communication theories\n5.4 Communication theories\n\nAntony Duff (2001 and 2011) offers a communication theory according to\nwhich punishment is necessary to communicate censure for wrongdoing.\nIt might be objected that his theory is too narrow to provide a\njustificatory framework for retributivism generally, because it is\nframed as a theory for legal punishment, meted out by a state\nthat governs a community of equal citizens. (The same applies to the\nsimilar theory developed by Markel 2011.) But arguably it could be\nextended to any community.\n\nPutting the narrowness issue aside, two questions remain. The first is\nwhether it is constructive for the sort of community that Duff strives\nto preserve to condemn wrongdoers. As Lacey and Pickard (2015a) put\nit, stigmatizing offenders with condemnation alienates them from\nsociety (and they are likely alienated already) and undermines their\npotential to see themselves as eventually redeemed. To this worry,\nDuff may be able to respond that the form of condemnation he has in\nmind is nothing more than treating wrongdoers as responsible for their\ncriminal acts.\n\nBut this then leads to a second question, namely whether Duff\u2019s\ntheory can account for hard treatment. As Duff raises the issue:\n\n\nCensure can \u2026 be communicated by \u201chard treatment\u201d\npunishments \u2026\u2014by imprisonment, by compulsory community\nservice, by fines and the like, which are burdensome independently of\ntheir censorial meaning\u2026: but why should we choose such methods\nof communication, rather than methods that do not involve hard\ntreatment? (Duff 2013)\n\n\nOne answer he gives is that:\n\n\n[P]enal hard treatment [is] an essential aspect of the enterprise of\nmoral communication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim not\nmerely to communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the\noffender to recognize and repent the wrong he has done, \u2026 and\nto make apologetic reparation to those whom he wronged. [The] hard\ntreatment aspects [of his punishment], the burden it imposes on him,\nshould serve both to assist the process of repentance and reform, by\nfocusing his attention on his crime and its implications, and as a way\nof making the apologetic reparation that he owes. (2013)\n\n\nThe problem, however, as Duff is well aware, is that it is not clear\nwhy \u201chard treatment [is] a necessary aspect of a\ncommunicative enterprise\u201d (2013, emphasis added). Indeed, Lacey\nand Pickard (2015a) suggest that hard treatment actually interferes\nwith the communicative enterprise.\n\nOne might think it is enough for retributivist accounts of punishment\nif hard treatment can constitute an important part of\ncommunicating to both the wrongdoer and the rest of the community the\ncensure that the wrongdoer deserves. The worry, however, is that it\nmay not suffice to say that hard treatment is one possible method of\ncommunicating censure. Given the normal moral presumptions against\nimposing suffering on others, it may be necessary to show that censure\nalone, unaccompanied by extra suffering, cannot be fully or\nproperly communicated. This may be very hard to show. Though the\npossibility that the value of suffering may depend on the context in\nwhich it is experience or inflicted\u2014see\n section 4.3.1\u2014may\n lighten the burden of proof.\n",
