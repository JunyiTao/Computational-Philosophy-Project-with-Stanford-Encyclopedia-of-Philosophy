    "main_text": "Self-Deceit and Ignorance\n7. Self-Deceit and Ignorance\n\nButler devoted three of his Sermons to issues connected with\nself-deceit (IV, VI, X). The focus on the pervasiveness of self-deceit\nas a serious moral problem is an important difference between Butler\nand his more optimistic confreres Hutcheson and Shaftesbury. For\nButler we are often self-deceived even when we think we are doing what\nis morally right (in fact if we think we are wholly in the right we\nare almost always deceived (Sermon X \u00a713)) and we often only\nrecognize our self-deception \u2014 if at all \u2014 upon later\nreflection. That we are so prone to self-deception is mainly due to a\nlack of reflection when acting prompted by self-partiality.\n\nAccording to Butler, most of us can access what the right thing is to\ndo in most circumstances, and most of us often wish to do the right\nthing when it doesn\u2019t conflict with our self-partiality. But we\nare also susceptible to engage in self-deceit in order to justify\nacting on self-partial motives even when it conflicts with what is\nmorally right. Butler illustrated this sort of self-deceit by\nreference to the example of Balaam, a prophet who had been asked to\ncurse the Israelites by the Moabites. Even though God expressly\nforbade Balaam, he still considered cursing the Israelites when\ngreater rewards were offered by Moabite ambassadors. The puzzle was\nhow could Balaam know what was right but still be motivated to do what\nwas wrong? Butler\u2019s answer was not so much to try to solve the\nproblem of akrasia as to describe the moral psychology of\nself-deceit.\n\nBalaam\u2019s moral failure was effected by his avoiding reflecting\non his actions, by a pervasive asymmetry in how we view ourselves and\nhow we view others due to native self-partiality that can only be\ncorrected by reflection, and by a difficulty in discerning the exact\ndegree to which we are obliged to act morally. The three are\ninterconnected. We are normally happy to unreflectively cut more slack\nfor ourselves than we are willing to cut for others due to\nself-partiality or an \u201coverfondness for ourselves\u201d (Sermon\nX \u00a76). When a morally right action is a matter of degree, it is\neasy and common to avoid reflection and to err on the side of\nself-partiality in the degree in which the moral action is undertaken.\nThis allows one to engage in more and more immoral acts while\nconvincing oneself that each undermining of the rule is justified and\nreasonable. In the story of Balaam, Balaam invites the ambassadors to\nstay the night under the aegis of hospitality. By analogy for Butler\nwe undermine rules under the aegis of ordinary sociability and\ncivility \u2014 for example we engage in self-serving malicious\ngossip under the aegis of being sociable \u2014 and gradually\nundermine our capacity to act from the dictate of conscience when\ncalled upon to do so.\n\nSince conscience is authoritative and proximate for Butler, and since\nthe dictates of conscience coincide with our self-love, self-deceit\nonly gets off the ground if we avoid reflection or if we reflect\npoorly. In addition to the oversimplifying and bad faith just\ndescribed, we give self-deceit a foothold by refusing to look at or\navoiding the facts of the matter when we feel these facts will go\nagainst our self-partial desires \u2014 Butler gives the example of\nprofligate spenders not looking at the state of their finances (Sermon\nX \u00a711) \u2014 and by relying piecemeal on the counsel of others\nwhen these counsels serve our interest.\n\nIn one of his less read sermons (Sermon IV) Butler suggests that\ncareful government of the tongue is important to one\u2019s moral\nwell being. The role of others \u2014 both our oppositions to and\nagreements with others \u2014 and its relation to self-governance is\nparticularly crucial for Butler in explaining this sort of\nself-deceit. Our tendency to paint the characters of others in black\nand white allows us to justify our immoral actions by virtue of the\nfact that we self-deceptively (and self-righteously) cast ourselves\nand our motivations as wholly good in opposition to our opponent who\nis wholly evil, and so we can treat them however we see fit. We also\ndraw on the idle comments of others that conform with our self-partial\ndesires to serve as external justification of our immoral actions.\n\nThe problem then is given human beings\u2019 great capacity for\nself-deceit, how can it be prevented? Is not the attempt to prevent\nself-deceit as prone to self-deceit as anything else? Butler\u2019s\nanswer is that habitual and systematic self-reflection and\nself-governance by rigid rules are the best response. In a manner\nreminiscent of Epictetus\u2019 famous maxim one must watch oneself as\nan enemy lying in ambush, and view one\u2019s actions as an enemy\nwould judging them harshly, Butler suggests a two part rule to this\nend \u201cOne is, to substitute another for yourself, when you take a\nsurvey of any part of your behavior, or consider what is proper and\nfit and reasonable for you to do on any occasion: the other part is,\nthat you\u2026 consider yourself as the person affected by such a\nbehavior,\u201d (Sermon X \u00a715). The rule \u201citself may be\ndishonestly applied\u201d but even the misguided attempt to apply it\nmay reveal more truth than not applying it at all. In the\nAnalogy Butler argued that one of the central moral purposes\nof this life is as a probationary period in the acquisition of habits\nof self-governance (Analogy V). That these habits are not\nfool-proof is a consequence of the fact that our ability to apply them\nseriously to ourselves is one of the bases for our ultimate punishment\nand reward.\n\nThe problem of self-deceit is connected to another of Butler\u2019s\nabiding themes, human ignorance of the larger design of God. In Sermon\nXV \u201cUpon Human Ignorance\u201d (notably the final sermon of the\ncollection), the Analogy and the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue,\u201d Butler stressed that our knowledge of design is\nprobable at best. Sermon XV concludes with an exhortation reminiscent\nof Locke. Since we have such limited knowledge of providence and of\nGod\u2019s design, we should turn our attention to that which we can\nhave knowledge of: our nature insofar as it bears on our moral\ngovernance and conduct.\n\nThe argument of the Analogy and the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d were both premised on this. In the Analogy,\nButler argued that we have probable evidence that our morally right\nand wrong actions will be judged and rewarded and punished by God and\nthat this life is a probationary period where we act in ways that will\nultimately be judged.\n",
