    "main_text": "The Principle of Contradiction\n2. The Principle of Contradiction\n\nLeibniz gives various formulations to his Principle of Contradiction\nor Law of Identity, but the central idea is that a proposition and its\nnegation cannot both be true (G 7: 299). Leibniz hoped to be able to\nconstruct a logical calculus that would enable all significant truths\nto be demonstrated, since every concept must include, be included in,\nor exclude every other. A concept such as \u2018human,\u2019 he\nmaintained, included the concepts \u2018animal,\u2019\n\u2018rational,\u2019 \u2018bipedal,\u2019 etc., so that a true\nstatement such as \u2018Humans are animals\u2019 was true in virtue\nof the inclusion of the predicate in the subject. Though the magnitude\nof Leibniz\u2019s contribution to combinatorial mathematics and logic\nremained unknown until the twentieth century, Kant offers some\nskeptical remarks to what he takes to be the Leibnizian programme in\nSection II of the New Elucidation. Later, he offers two\nspecific criticisms of the Principle of Contradiction taken not in a\nlogical, but in an ontological sense:\n\nFirst, Kant claims, the Principle is too weak to ban nonentities from\ntheories. In Sect 28 of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770), he\ncomplains of \u201cfictitious forces fabricated at will, which, not\nfinding any obstacle in the principle of contradiction are poured\nforth in multitudes by those of speculative mind.\u201d These\nfictitious forces presumably included extrasensory powers of\nperception and the direct action of souls on souls. Second, the\nPrinciple of Contradiction is too strong. Leibniz\u2019s Neoplatonic\nleanings induce him to see creatures as fragments of the divine, whose\nimperfections are mere lacks. There are, in his ontology, no beings or\nforces opposing God (Theodicy, \u00a720). Kant\u2019s\norientation is more Manichaean; he thinks that acceptance of the\nPrinciple leads the theorist to underrepresent the extent of conflict\nin the world and its constructive aspects. Kant insists that opposing\nforces, \u201chindering and counteracting processes\u201d operate\nceaselessly in nature and in history. The opposition of attractive and\nrepulsive forces in physics produces the phenomena of matter (4: 508\nff); the opposition of good and evil principles in the human soul\nproduces morality, (6:1\u2013190); and antagonism and conflict in\ngeopolitics produce peace and progress (6:24). Kant denies the\nLeibnizian claim that all evil follows from the limitations of\ncreatures (KRV A 273/B. 329).\n",
