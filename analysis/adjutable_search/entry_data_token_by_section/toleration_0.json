    "main_text": "The Concept of Toleration and its Paradoxes\n1. The Concept of Toleration and its Paradoxes\n\nIt is necessary to differentiate between a general concept\nand more specific conceptions of toleration (see also Forst\n2013). The former is marked by the following characteristics. First,\nit is essential for the concept of toleration that the tolerated\nbeliefs or practices are considered to be objectionable and in an\nimportant sense wrong or bad. If this objection component\n(cf. King 1976, 44\u201354 on the components of toleration) is\nmissing, we do not speak of \u201ctoleration\u201d but of\n\u201cindifference\u201d or \u201caffirmation.\u201d Second, the\nobjection component needs to be balanced by an acceptance\ncomponent, which does not remove the negative judgment but gives\ncertain positive reasons that trump the negative ones in the relevant\ncontext. In light of these reasons, it would be wrong not to tolerate\nwhat is wrong, to mention a well-known paradox of toleration\n(discussed below). The said practices or beliefs are wrong, but not\nintolerably wrong. Third, the limits of toleration need to be\nspecified. They lie at the point where there are reasons for rejection\nthat are stronger than the reasons for acceptance (which still leaves\nopen the question of the appropriate means of a possible\nintervention); call this the rejection component.\nAll three of those reasons can be of one and the same\nkind\u2014religious, for example\u2014yet they can also be of\ndiverse kinds (moral, religious, pragmatic, to mention a few\npossibilities; cf. Newey 1999, 32\u201334 and Cohen 2014).\n\nFurthermore, it needs to be stressed that there are two\nboundaries involved in this interpretation of the concept of\ntoleration: the first one lies between (1) the normative realm of\nthose practices and beliefs one agrees with and (2) the realm of the\npractices and beliefs that one finds wrong but can still tolerate; the\nsecond boundary lies between this latter realm and (3) the realm of\nthe intolerable that is strictly rejected. There are thus three, not\njust two normative realms in a context of toleration.\n\nFinally, one can only speak of toleration where it is practiced\nvoluntarily and is not compelled, for otherwise it would be a\ncase of simply \u201csuffering\u201d or \u201cenduring\u201d\ncertain things that one rejects but against which one is powerless. It\nis, however, wrong to conclude from this that the tolerant need to be\nin a position to effectively prohibit or interfere with the tolerated\npractices, for a minority that does not have this power may very well\nbe tolerant in holding the view that if it had such power, it would\nnot use it to suppress other parties (cf. Williams 1996).\n\nBased on these characteristics, we can identify three paradoxes of\ntoleration that are much discussed in philosophical analyses of the\nconcept, and each one refers to one of the components mentioned above.\nFirst, there is the paradox of the tolerant racist, which\nconcerns the objection component. Sometimes people argue that someone\nwho believes that there are \u201cinferior races\u201d the members\nof which do not deserve equal respect should be \u201cmore\ntolerant.\u201d Thus the racist would be called tolerant if he curbed\nhis desire to discriminate against the members of such groups, say,\nfor strategic reasons. Thus if (and only if) we considered tolerance\nto be a moral virtue, the paradox arises that an immoral attitude (to\nthink of other \u201craces\u201d in such way) would be turned into\npart of a virtue. What is more, the racist would be more\n\u201ctolerant\u201d the stronger his racist impulses are if only he\ndid not act on them (cf. Horton 1996). Hence, seen from a moral\nperspective, the demand that the racist should be tolerant has a major\nflaw: it takes the racist objection against others as an ethical\nobjection that only needs to be restrained by adding certain reasons\nfor acceptance. It thus turns an unacceptable prejudice into an\nethical judgment. From this it follows that the reasons for objection\nmust be reasonable in a minimal sense; they cannot be generally\nshareable, of course, but they must also not rest on irrational\nprejudice and hatred. The racist, therefore, can neither exemplify the\nvirtue of tolerance nor should he be asked to be tolerant; what is\nnecessary is that he overcome his racist beliefs. This shows that\nthere are cases in which tolerance is not the solution to\nintolerance.\n\nSecond, we encounter the paradox of moral tolerance, which\narises in connection with the acceptance component (for various\nanalyses of this paradox, see Ebbinghaus 1950, Raphael 1988, Mendus\n1989, Horton 1994). If both the reasons for objection and the reasons\nfor acceptance are called \u201cmoral,\u201d the paradox arises that\nit seems to be morally right or even morally required to tolerate what\nis morally wrong. The solution of this paradox therefore requires a\ndistinction between various kinds of \u201cmoral\u201d reasons, some\nof which must be reasons of a higher order that ground and limit\ntoleration.\n\nThird, there is the paradox of drawing the limits, which\nconcerns the rejection component. This paradox is inherent in the idea\nthat toleration is a matter of reciprocity and that therefore those\nwho are intolerant need not and cannot be tolerated, an idea we find\nin most of the classical texts on toleration. But even a brief look at\nthose texts, and even more so at historical practice, shows that the\nslogan \u201cno toleration of the intolerant\u201d is not just\nvacuous but potentially dangerous, for the characterization of certain\ngroups as intolerant is all too often itself a result of one-sidedness\nand intolerance. In a deconstructivist reading, this leads to a fatal\nconclusion for the concept of toleration (cf. Fish 1997): If\ntoleration always implies a drawing of the limits against the\nintolerant and intolerable, and if every such drawing of a limit is\nitself a (more or less) intolerant, arbitrary act, toleration ends as\nsoon it begins\u2014as soon as it is defined by an arbitrary boundary\nbetween \u201cus\u201d and the \u201cintolerant\u201d and\n\u201cintolerable.\u201d This paradox can only be overcome if we\ndistinguish between two notions of \u201cintolerance\u201d that the\ndeconstructivist critique conflates: the intolerance of those who lie\nbeyond the limits of toleration because they deny toleration as a norm\nin the first place, and the lack of tolerance of those who do not want\nto tolerate a denial of the norm. Tolerance can only be a virtue if\nthis distinction can be made, and it presupposes that the limits of\ntoleration can be drawn in a non-arbitrary, justifiable way.\n\nThe discussion so far implies that toleration is a normatively\ndependent concept. This means that by itself it cannot provide\nthe substantive reasons for objection, acceptance, and rejection. It\nneeds further, independent normative resources in order to have a\ncertain substance, content, and limits\u2014and in order to be\nregarded as something good at all. In itself, therefore, toleration is\nnot a virtue or value; it can only be a value if backed by the right\nnormative reasons.\n",
