    "main_text": "Mind and Epistemology\n7. Mind and Epistemology\n\n\nNeither the canonical literature nor the early Abhidharma schools \nprovide detailed accounts of the means by which we may discriminate \nbetween veridical and non-veridical states of cognitive awareness. \nWorks such as the Kath\u0101vatthu (ca. 150 C.E.) do concern\nthemselves with the rules and the various types of debate and \nconsider a wide range of views, but there is no systematic account of\nthe criteria that ensure certainty. For systematic treatments of the \nepistemological import of various states of cognitive awareness we \nmust turn to the Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition \n(pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da) initiated by Dign\u0101ga (ca.\n480\u2013540) and Dharmak\u012brti (ca. 600\u2013660) [I will refer \nto these two thinkers, and to their followers, as \n\u2018epistemologists\u2019 so as to highlight that their concerns \nare primarily epistemological]. It is generally agreed that this \ntradition sprang out of a growing preoccupation with issues of logic \nand language among those Buddhists who regarded polemical engagement \nwith their Brahmanical opponents as vital to their philosophical \nenterprise (see Frauwallner 1959, Hattori 1968, Hayes 1988, Matilal \n1998). In spearheading his model of epistemological inquiry \nDign\u0101ga (and following him, Dharmak\u012brti) significantly \nchanged the course of Buddhist philosophy in India. \n\n\nThe two most influential works of the Buddhist logico-epistemological\ntradition are Dign\u0101ga\u2019s Collection on Valid\nCognition (Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya; hereafter PS)\nand Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Commentary on Valid Cognition\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika; hereafter PV).\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s work, essentially a commentary on\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s, is to be singled out as one of the most\noutstanding contributions to Indian Buddhist thought, presenting a\ndefinite account of what later generations of philosophers in India\ntook to be the normative Buddhist view. Dharmak\u012brti influenced\nthe views of later Buddhist philosophers such as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (725\u2013783), Kamala\u015b\u012bla\n(740\u2013795), J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha (8th century), Dharmottara\n(750\u2013810), J\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra (ca.\n975\u20131050), Ratnak\u012brti (11th century)\nRatn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti (11\u201312th century) and\nMok\u1e63akaragupta (1150\u20131202).\n",
