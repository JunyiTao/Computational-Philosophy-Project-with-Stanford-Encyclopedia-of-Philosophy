    "main_text": "\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) was a creative mathematician\nof the first order, an important scientific thinker, and an original\nmetaphysician. During the course of his life, he was a mathematician\nfirst, a natural scientist or \u201cnatural philosopher\u201d\nsecond, and a metaphysician third. In mathematics, he developed the\ntechniques that made possible algebraic (or \u201canalytic\u201d)\ngeometry. In natural philosophy, he can be credited with several\nachievements: the first to publish the sine law of refraction;\ndeveloper of an important empirical account of the rainbow; and\nproposer of a naturalistic account of the formation of the earth and\nplanets (a precursor to the nebular hypothesis, that the planets\nformed from loose matter orbiting the sun). More importantly, he\noffered a new vision of the natural world, which shaped modern\nphysics: a world of matter possessing a few fundamental properties and\ninteracting according to a few universal laws. This natural world\nincluded an immaterial mind that, in human beings, was directly\nrelated to the brain, a position that led to the modern\nmind\u2013body problem. In metaphysics (the search for the basic\nprinciples of everything there is), Descartes provided arguments for\nthe existence of God and to show that the essence of matter is to be\nspatially extended, and that the essence of mind is thought (where\n\u201cthought\u201d includes sensory images as well as rational\ndiscourse). Descartes claimed early on to possess a special method,\nwhich was variously exhibited in mathematics, natural philosophy, and\nmetaphysics, and which came to include, or to be supplemented by, a\nmethod of doubt.\n\nDescartes presented his results in major works published during his\nlifetime: the Discourse on the Method (in French, 1637), with\nits essays, the Dioptrics, Meteorology, and\nGeometry; the Meditations on First Philosophy (i.e.,\non metaphysics), with its Objections and Replies (in Latin, 1641, 2nd\nedn. 1642); the Principles of Philosophy, covering his\nmetaphysics and much of his natural philosophy (in Latin, 1644); and\nthe Passions of the Soul, on the emotions (in French, 1649).\nWorks published posthumously included his Compendium of Music\n(in Latin, 1650), Letters (in Latin and French,\n1657\u201367); World, or Treatise on Light, containing the\ncore of his natural philosophy (in French, 1664); Treatise on\nMan (in French, 1664), containing his physiology and mechanistic\npsychology; and the Rules for the Direction of the Mind (in\nLatin, 1701), an early, unfinished work attempting to set out his\nmethod.\n\nDescartes\u2019 works have been variously received and valued. Among\nthe learned of his day he was considered to be a top mathematician,\nthe developer of a new and comprehensive physics or theory of nature\n(including living things), and the proposer of a new metaphysics. In\nthe years following his death, his natural philosophy was especially\nvalued and discussed. His works were invoked in debates over the\nequality of women. In the eighteenth century, aspects of his science\nremained influential, as did his project of investigating the\ncognitive capacities of the knower in assessing the possibility and\nextent of human knowledge. He was also remembered for his skeptical\narguments and for failing to provide a successful response to them in\nhis metaphysics. In the nineteenth century, he was revered for his\nmechanistic physiology and theory that animal bodies are machines (are\nconstituted by material mechanisms, governed by the laws of matter\nalone). The twentieth century variously celebrated his famous\n\u201ccogito\u201d starting point, reviled the sense data that some\nalleged to be the legacy of his skeptical starting point, and looked\nto him as a model of the culturally engaged philosopher. He has been\nvariously seen as a hero and a villain; as a brilliant theorist\nforging new directions in thought and as harbinger of a cold,\nrationalistic, and calculative conception of human beings. Those new\nto the study of Descartes should engage his own works in some detail\nprior to developing a view of his legacy.\n",
