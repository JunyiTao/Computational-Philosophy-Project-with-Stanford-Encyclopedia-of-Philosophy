    "main_text": "Spinoza\n4. Spinoza\n\n\nThe centrality of substance for the continental rationalists is\nfurther borne out by the importance of that concept for Spinoza,\nespecially within his Ethics. Spinoza devoted the entire\nfirst part of that work to a consideration of substance, or, as he\nalso termed it \u201cDeus sive Natura\u201d (\u201cGod, in\nother words, Nature\u201d). The remaining parts trace the\nconsequences of his conception of substance for epistemology,\npsychology, physics, and ethics. While Spinoza\u2019s account of\nsubstance is quite rightly regarded as a development and working-out\nof Descartes\u2019s metaphysics, there are also (as with Descartes\nand Malebranche) considerable, and important, differences between the\ntwo. What is important for our present purposes, however, is that (as\nwith Malebranche) Spinoza\u2019s departures from Descartes are almost\nalways the manifestation of a form of rationalism purer than\nDescartes\u2019s own. Most radically, Spinoza replaced\nDescartes\u2019s substance pluralism with a monistic account modelled\non Cartesian extended substance. Just as, in some places, Descartes\ntreats bodies as mere modes of a single extended substance, so, for\nSpinoza, all individuals\u2014both bodies and minds\u2014are modes\nof a single substance.\n\n\nSpinoza arrived at this position by way of a decidedly uncartesian\naccount of attributes. While Descartes held that two substances of the\nsame type can share the same principal attribute, Spinoza rejected\nthis. Any two substances, argued Spinoza, must be distinguished either\nby their attributes (Spinoza dropped the modifier\n\u201cprincipal\u201d) or by their modes. But, since modes are\nthemselves both ontologically and causally dependent on the substances\nof which they are affections, they cannot be the individuating\nprinciple for them. Thus, it must be the attributes themselves that\nindividuate substances (and not just types of substances, as\nDescartes argued). Similarly, while Descartes held that each substance\nis characterized by one and only one principal attribute, Spinoza\ninvoked the principle of plenitude to show that substance must have\ninfinite attributes. Based on a variation of the ontological argument,\nhe maintained that substance is pure, utterly unlimited being. It must\ntherefore, he argued, possess infinite attributes, in the dual sense\nof possessing unlimited attributes and of possessing all\nattributes. Since substance is characterized by infinite attributes,\nand since no two substances can share a single attribute, there can be\nonly one substance. This radical monism was repugnant to many who,\nlike English philosopher Anne Conway, saw that it eliminated any and\nall distinction between the creator, God, and His creation.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s one substance is at the farthest possible remove from\nAristotle\u2019s proper substances. Whereas, for Aristotle,\nindividual things, such as Bucephalus, are paradigmatic substances,\nSpinoza denies their substantiality. But does this mean that, unlike\nAristotelian proper substances, which are not predicable of anything\nelse, Spinoza\u2019s finite modes are predicable of substance?\nScholars are divided on this point. Curley has argued that Spinoza\nretains the conception of the substance-mode distinction as a\ndistinction between independent and dependent being, but rejects the\nview that the substance-mode distinction correlates to the distinction\nbetween a subject of predication and its predicate. Bennett, however,\nargues that Spinoza does indeed regard finite modes as predicable of\nsubstance, or, as he puts it, as \u201cadjectival on the\nworld\u201d. Bennett characterizes Spinoza\u2019s account of\nsubstance as a \u201cfield metaphysic\u201d in which individual\nthings are simply clusters of qualities within regions of space. Just\nas a blush is merely a confluence of properties on a region of a face,\nso the face\u2014indeed, the person whose face it is\u2014is a\nconfluence of properties \u201con a region\u201d of substance.\n\n\nWhether or not Spinoza rejected the predicability of finite modes, it\nis clear that he did not regard them as either causally or\nconceptually independent in the way that is requisite for substance.\nFor Spinoza, substance is \u201cin itself and is conceived through\nitself\u201d, whereas a mode is \u201cin something else and is\nconceived through something else\u201d. The \u201cin itself/in\nsomething else\u201d aspect of these two definitions captures\nDescartes\u2019s conception of causal independence, while the\n\u201cconceived through itself/through something else\u201d aspect\nrefers to Descartes\u2019s conceivability-apart criterion for\nontological independence. Descartes, it will be recalled, regarded\ndivine substance as both causally and ontologically independent, but\ncreated substances as ontologically, but not causally, independent,\nsince they depend on God\u2019s creative (and conservative) power for\ntheir existence. It is in this sense that, for Descartes, the term\n\u201csubstance\u201d is used equivocally for God and created\nsubstances. Spinoza, however, denied that \u201csubstance\u201d is\nan equivocal term. In so doing, he eliminated two asymmetries in\nDescartes\u2019s metaphysics\u2014that between divine and created\nsubstance, and the asymmetry between extended and thinking substance\nthat Descartes expresses in the Synopsis to\nthe Meditations. For Spinoza, finite minds are not themselves\nsubstances, but rather modes of thinking substance. That is, for\nSpinoza, at the most fundamental level, all minds reduce to the\nthinking substance of which they are affections.\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the eternal verities marks a similar\nrationalistic advance over Descartes\u2019s metaphysics. For Spinoza,\nGod is just substance simpliciter. He lacks volition and personality;\nhis only characteristics are pure being, infinity, necessity, and\nactivity. While Spinoza agreed with Descartes that God is the cause of\nall things, he regarded him not as a transeunt cause, creating the\nuniverse \u201cfrom the outside\u201d through an act of will, but as\nan immanent cause, from whom the universe unfolds out of his own\nnecessity. For Spinoza, all things therefore follow by logical (and\nnot merely causal) necessity from God\u2019s eternal and infinite\nnature. In this sense, not only mathematical truths but indeed such\napparently contingent facts as Caesar\u2019s having crossed the\nRubicon are necessary truths for Spinoza. The difference between them\nis not the necessity of the truths themselves but rather the route\nthat we take to arrive at them. While mathematical truths, for\ninstance, are deducible by reason alone, Spinoza recognized that the\nfinitude of human understanding prevents, or at least impedes, our\nsimilarly deducing empirical facts about the world. In contrast with\nsome empiricists, who regard cause and effect as mere constant\nconjunction, for Spinoza, the relationship between cause and effect\nhas the force of a logical entailment; empirical facts are themselves\nnecessary truths. The universe is thus, in principle at least,\nperfectly intelligible to reason.\n\n\nFor Spinoza, as for Descartes, the metaphysical commitment to\nsubstance underwrote a rationalist epistemology that strongly\nprivileges reason and intuition over sensation and imagination. The\ndistinctive character of Spinoza\u2019s epistemological rationalism\nis rooted in his principle that \u201cthe order and connection of\nideas is the order and connection of things\u201d. For Descartes, the\nmind and the body are, though intimately connected, radically\nheterogeneous.  How it is that the mind comes to know things about the\nphysical world therefore remains, despite his best efforts, a somewhat\nmurky business.  By rejecting the substantiality of both minds and\nbodies, and by regarding them both as modes of a single substance,\nSpinoza obviated this difficulty. For Spinoza, the mind and the body\nare the very same thing conceived in two different ways. Persistent\nclusters of qualities in space are bodies. The ideas\u2014or, in\nDescartes\u2019s terminology, the objective reality\u2014of these\nbodies are minds. Just as a single body has a corresponding objective\nreality, so collections of bodies characterized by various relations\nalso have a corresponding objective reality with isomorphic parts and\nrelations. Since there is no gap between minds and bodies, there is\ntherefore no difficulty in principle in perceiving the physical\nworld. On Spinoza\u2019s account, we perceive the physical world in\ntwo ways\u2014(1) by perceiving the actions of our own bodies, and\n(2) by perceiving the effects of other bodies on ours. Thus, when\none\u2019s body runs, the correlative ideas are in one\u2019s mind.\nLikewise, when someone steps on one\u2019s toe, the physical effects\non the toe likewise have their counterparts in the mind\u2019s\nideas.\n\n\nDespite the necessary connection the mind has with the body, argued\nSpinoza, sensation and imagination are inherently limited. The idea of\nsubstance qua substance must be a perfect unity. However, the idea\nwhich constitutes the human mind is complex\u2014not a unity but a\nplurality of ideas. That idea is therefore confused, rather than clear\nand distinct. Clear and distinct understanding, on Spinoza\u2019s\naccount, must partake of the unity of the idea of substance, and not of\nthe fragmentary nature of the idea of the human body and its\naffects. This cognitive unity is achieved in two ways\u2014through\nreason (which Spinoza termed \u201cknowledge of the second\nkind\u201d) and through intuition (\u201cknowledge of the third\nkind\u201d). When we cognize through sensation and imagination\n(\u201cknowledge of the first kind\u201d), we try to grasp many\nideas at once, and thereby produce confusion. Reason and intuition, by\ncontrast, provide us with access to just one idea\u2014the\nsubstantial unity underlying our body and our mind. Reason does this\nfrom \u201cthe fact that we have common notions and adequate ideas of\nthe properties of things\u201d, while intuition proceeds \u201cfrom\nan adequate idea of the formal essence of certain attributes of\nGod\u201d. To understand the substantial unity that is the necessary\ncause of our body and our mind is to grasp them sub specie\naeternitatis.\n\n\nThis epistemological ideal forms the core of Spinoza\u2019s rationalistic\nethics\u2014and, hence, on one plausible account, the core of his\nEthics. Spinoza\u2019s monism entails that the sort of\nindividuals that Aristotle regarded as primary substances are\ndistinguished not by their own substantial unity, but by their\nconatus\u2014their striving to persist. Thus, self-preservation is\nnot just one possible goal of ethical agents; it is the very thing\nthat makes those agents individuals. Our essence, and our ethical\ntask, is thus to be active, whereas, by contrast, to be passive\nthreatens our persistence. The mind persists through activity and is\nthreatened by passivity. It is therefore in our self-interest to\npursue adequate ideas through knowledge of the second and third\nkinds. The more we join our minds with God through adequate knowledge\nof things under the form of eternity, the less we are affected by\nexternal things and, hence, by our own passions, which are nothing but\nour passivity in the face of forces external to us. Adequate knowledge\nof God gives us equanimity and calm, and literally ensures our\npersistence. Ethical virtue is thus fundamentally epistemological. For\nSpinoza, the most rationalist of figures discussed here, the good life\nis the utterly rational life.\n",
