Are the stylistic elements present in mathematical discourse\ndevoid of cognitive value and so only part of the coloring of\nmathematical discourse or can they be seen as more intimately related\nto its cognitive content? The notion of coloring here comes from Frege\nwho distinguished in \u201cThe thought\u201d between the truth\ncondition of a statement and those aspects of the statement which\nmight provide information about the state of mind of the speaker or\nhearer but do not contribute to its truth conditions. In natural\nlanguage, typical elements of coloring are expressions of regret such\nas \u201cunfortunately\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s\nsnowing\u201d has the same truth conditions as \u201cit\u2019s\nsnowing\u201d and \u201cunfortunately\u201d, in the first sentence,\nis only part of the coloring. Jacques and Monique Dubucs have\ngeneralized this distinction to proofs in \u201cLa couleur des\npreuves\u201d (Dubucs and Dubucs 1994) where they deal with the\nproblem of a \u2018rhetoric of mathematics\u2019, a problem quite\nclose to that of an analysis of style. Dubbing traditional rhetoric as\n\u2018residualist\u2019, for it takes into account only phenomena of\nnon-cognitive significance such as ornamentation etc. of the\nmathematical text but leaves the object (such as the content of a\ndemonstration) untouched, they explored the options for a more\nambitious \u201crhetoric of mathematics\u201d.\n\nOne can thus begin to articulate the first position that can be\ndefended with respect to the epistemological significance of style. It\nis a position that denies style any essential cognitive role and\nreduces it to a phenomenon of subjective coloring. According to this\nposition, stylistic variations would only reveal superficial\ndifferences of expression that leave the content of discourse\nuntouched.\n\nTwo more ambitious positions have been defended in the literature\nconcerning the cognitive content of style. The first seems to be\ncompatible with a form of Platonism or realism in mathematics whereas\nthe second is definitely opposed to it. What is being alluded to are\nthe two main proposals available in the literature, namely those of\nGranger 1968 and Hacking 1992, which will now be briefly\ndescribed.\n\nGranger\u2019s Essay of a philosophy of style (Essai\nd\u2019une philosophie du style 1968) is the most systematic and\nworked-out effort to develop a theory of style for mathematics.\nGranger\u2019s program is so ambitious and rich that a thorough\ndiscussion of the structure of his book and of his detailed analyses\nwould need a paper by itself (see also Benis-Sinaceur 2010). Due to\nlimitation of space, the aim here is to give just a rough idea of what\nthe project consists in and to show that the epistemological role of\nstyle defended by Ganger is compatible with a realism about\nmathematical entities or structures.\n\n\nGranger\u2019s aim is to provide an analysis of \u2018scientific\npractice\u2019. He defines practice as \u201can activity considered\nwith its complex context, and in particular the social conditions\nwhich give it meaning in a world effectively experienced\n(v\u00e9cu)\u201d (1968, 6). Science he defines as\n\u201cconstruction of abstract models, consistent and effective, of\nthe phenomena\u201d (13). Thus, a scientific practice has both\n\u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019 components and\n\u2018individual\u2019 components. The analysis of scientific\npractice requires at least three types of investigations:\n\nThere are many ways of structuring, by means of models, a certain\nphenomenon; and the same models can be applied to different phenomena.\nMoreover, scientific constructions, including mathematical ones,\nreveal a certain \u201cstructural unity\u201d. Both of these aspects\nwill be the theme of a stylistic analysis.\nThe second investigation concerns a \u2018scientific\ncharacteriology\u2019, aimed a studying the psychological components\nwhich are relevant in the individuation of scientific practice;\nThe third investigation concerns the study of the\n\u2018contingency\u2019 of scientific creation, always located in\nspace and time.\n\n\nAll three aspects would be necessary for an analysis of\n\u2018scientific practice\u2019 but in his book Granger only focuses\non 1. Where do style and mathematics come in? Mathematics comes in as\none of the areas of investigation that can be subjected to a stylistic\nanalysis of science (Granger\u2019s book provides applications not\nonly to mathematics but also to linguistics and the social sciences).\nWhat about style? Every social practice, according to Granger, can be\nstudied from the point of view of style. This includes political\naction, artistic creation and scientific activity. There is thus a\ngeneral stylistics that will try to capture the most general stylistic\nfeatures of such activities and then more \u2018local\u2019\nstylistic analyses such as the one provided by Granger for scientific\nactivities. Obviously, the concept of style here invoked must be one\nthat is much more encompassing than the one usually associated with\nthis term and indeed one that would make application to such areas as\npolitical activity or scientific activity not just metaphorical but\nrather \u2018connaturate\u2019 to such activities.\n\nGranger\u2019s analysis of mathematical style takes up chapters 2, 3,\nand 4 of his book. Chapter 2 deals with Euclidean style and the notion\nof magnitude; chapter 3 with the opposition between \u2018Cartesian\nstyle and Desarguian style\u2019 (on the Cartesian style see also\nRabouin 2017); finally, chapter 4 concerns the \u2018birth of\nvectorial style\u2019. All of these analyses center around the\nconcept of \u201cgeometrical magnitude\u201d.\n\nOne gets a good sense of what Granger is after by simply looking at an\nexample that he describes in his preface. This is an example\nconcerning the complex numbers.\n\nStyle, according to Granger, is a way of imposing structure to an\nexperience. Experience must be taken here to go beyond empirical\nexperience. In general the kind of experience the mathematician\nappeals to is not empirical. From this experience come the\n\u201cintuitive\u201d components that are structured in mathematical\nactivity. But one should not think that there is an\n\u201cintuition\u201d to which, as it were externally, one then\napplies a form. The mathematical activity gives rise at the same time\nto form and content within the background of a certain experience.\n\nStyle appears to us here on the one hand as a way of introducing the\nconcepts of a theory, of connecting them, of unifying them; and on the\nother hand, as a way of delimiting the what intuition contributes to\nthe determination of these concepts. (Granger 1968, 20)\n\n\nAs an example Granger gives three ways of introducing the complex\nnumbers; all three ways account for the structural properties which\ncharacterize the algebraic structure in question. The first way\nintroduces the complex numbers by trigonometric representation using\nangles and directions. The second introduces them as operators applied\nto vectors. In the first case, one defines a complex number as a pair\nof real numbers and the additive properties are then immediate. By\ncontrast, in the second case, it is the multiplicative properties that\nare immediately seized. But, and this is the third way, one can also\nintroduce complex numbers by regular square matrices. This leads to\nseeing the complex numbers as a system of polynomials in x\nmodulo x2+1.\n\nThese different ways of grasping a concept, of integrating it in an\noperative system and of associating to it some intuitive\nimplications\u2014of which one will have to delimit the exact\nextent\u2014constitute what we call aspects of style. It is evident\nthat the structural content of the notion is not here affected, that\nthe concept qua mathematical object subsists identically through these\neffects of style. It is however not always so and we will encounter\nstylistic positions which demand true conceptual variations. What\nchanges always, in any case, is the orientation of the concept towards\nthis or that usage, this or that extension. Thus, style plays a role\nthat is perhaps essential both with respect to the dialectic of the\ninternal development of mathematics and to that of its relation to\nworlds of more concrete objects. (Granger 1968, 21).\n\n\nThus, in Granger\u2019s theory mathematical styles are modes of\npresentation, or modes of grasping the mathematical structures. At\nleast in some cases these effects of style leave the mathematical\nobjects or structures unaffected although they will affect the\ncognitive mode in which they are apprehended, therefore affecting how\nthey might be subjected to extension, applied in various areas etc.\nEven though Granger might have sympathized with a Kantianism without a\ntranscendental subject, and thus think of style as constitutive, it\nseems that his position is at least compatible with a form of realism\nabout mathematical entities. This does not seem to be the case for the\nthird and final epistemological position to be discussed, which is due\nto Ian Hacking.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, Hacking, following Crombie, has proposed\ninvestigating the notion of style as a \u201cnew analytical\ntool\u201d for history and philosophy of science. His preference is\nto speak of styles of reasoning (see also Mancosu 2005) as opposed to\nFleck\u2019s thought styles or Crombie\u2019s styles of thinking\n(his most recent preference is to speak of \u2018Styles of scientific\nthinking & doing\u2019; for the most recent discussion of\nHacking\u2019s program at the time of writing see Kusch 2010 and the\nspecial issue of Studies in History and Philosophy of Science\n(issue 43, 2012), including Hacking 2012 and several other\ncontributions). The reason is that Hacking wants to move away from the\npsychological level of reasoning and work with the more\n\u2018objective\u2019 level of arguments. He explicitly defines his\nproject as a continuation of Kant\u2019s project aimed at explaining\nhow objectivity is possible. And indeed, Hacking\u2019s position\nrejects realism and embraces a strongly constitutive role for style.\nAccording to Hacking, styles are defined by a set of necessary\nconditions (he does not attempt, wisely, to provide sufficient\nconditions):\n\nThere are neither sentences that are candidates for truth, nor\nindependently identified objects to be correct about, prior to the\ndevelopment of a style of reasoning. Every style of reasoning\nintroduces a great many novelties including new types of: Objects;\nevidence; sentences, new ways of being a candidate for truth or\nfalsehood; laws, or at any rate modalities; possibilities. One should\nalso notice, on occasion, new types of classification and new types of\nexplanation. (Hacking 1992, 11)\n\n\nIt should be clear that this notion of style, just like\nGranger\u2019s, attributes a very important role to style as\ngrounding the objectivity of an entire area of scientific activity but\nthat, unlike Granger\u2019s, it is committed ontologically to a\nrejection of realism. Styles are essential in the constitution of\nmathematical objects and the latter do not have a form of existence\nindependent of them. Hacking has not extensively discussed case\nstudies from the history of mathematics although one of his papers\n(Hacking 1995) deals with four constructionalist images of mathematics\n(the word \u201cconstructionalism\u201d is borrowed from Nelson\nGoodman) and shows how well they fit with his picture of \u2018styles\nof thinking\u2019. By implication, it is also clear that more\nrobustly committed realistic positions will not fit well with\nHacking\u2019s account of reasoning styles.\n\nThus, three possible models for explicating the epistemological role\nof \u2018styles\u2019 in mathematics have been considered. There are\nsurely many more possible positions waiting to be articulated but so\nfar this is all that can be found in the literature.\n",
