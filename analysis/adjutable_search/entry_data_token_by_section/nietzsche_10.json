    "main_text": "Key Doctrines || Perspectivism\n6.3 The Eternal Recurrence of the Same\n\nNietzsche himself suggests that the eternal recurrence was his most\nimportant thought, but that has not made it any easier for\ncommentators to understand. Nietzsche\u2019s articulations of the\ndoctrine all involve hypothesizing\u2014(or inducing the reader to\nimagine, or depicting a character considering)\u2014the idea that all\nevents in the world repeat themselves in the same sequence through an\neternal series of cycles. But the texts are difficult to interpret.\nAll Nietzsche\u2019s official presentations of the thought in\npublished work are either presented in hypothetical terms (GS\n341), or extremely elliptical and allusive (e.g., GS 109), or\nhighly metaphorical and quasi-hermetic (Z III, 2, 13), or all\nthree together. Most allusions to the idea, in fact, assume that one\nalready knows what it means\u2014even the claims in Ecce\nHomo that it is the \u201cfundamental conception\u201d or\n\u201cbasic idea\u201d of Zarathustra have this character.\nIn the early reception, most readers took Nietzsche to be offering a\ncosmological hypothesis about the structure of time or of fate (see\nSimmel [1907] 1920; Heidegger 1961; L\u00f6with [1935] 1997; Jaspers\n[1936] 1965), and various problems have been posed for the thesis, so\nunderstood (Simmel [1907] 1920: 250\u20131n; Soll 1973; Anderson\n2005: 217 n28). Many later commentators have focused instead on the\nexistential or practical significance of the thought (Magnus 1978;\nNehamas 1980, 1985), or its \u201cmythological\u201d import (Hatab\n2005).\n\nIn the aftermath of Nehamas (1985), an influential line of readings\nhas argued that the thought to which Nietzsche attributed such\n\u201cfundamental\u201d significance was never a cosmological or\ntheoretical claim at all\u2014whether about time, or fate, or the\nworld, or the self\u2014but instead a practical thought\nexperiment designed to test whether one\u2019s life has been\ngood. The broad idea is that one imagines the endless return\nof life, and one\u2019s emotional reaction to the prospect reveals\nsomething about how valuable one\u2019s life has been, much as\n(quoting Maudemarie Clark\u2019s memorable analogy) a spouse\u2019s\nquestion about whether one would marry again evokes\u2014and indeed,\nfairly demands\u2014an assessment of the state of the marriage (see\nClark 1990: 245\u201386; Wicks 1993; Ridley 1997; Williams 2001;\nReginster 2006: 201\u201327; Anderson 2005, 2009; Risse 2009;\nHuddleston 2022). Naturally, the threat of emerging\nscholarly consensus around this line of interpretation has prompted\npushback, and Paul Loeb (2006, 2013, 2021) has recently offered\nvigorous defense of a cosmological interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s\nidea, building on earlier work by Alistair Moles (1989, 1990).\n\nSkeptics like Loeb are correct to insist that, if recurrence is to be\nunderstood as a practical thought experiment, commentators owe us an\naccount of how the particular features of the relevant thoughts are\nsupposed to make any difference (Soll 1973 already posed a stark form\nof this challenge). Three features seem especially salient: we are\nsupposed to imagine 1) that the past recurs, so that what has\nhappened in the past will be re-experienced in the future; 2) that\nwhat recurs is the same in every detail; and 3) that the\nrecurrence happens not just once more, or even many times more, but\neternally. The supposed recurrence (1) plausibly\nmatters as a device for overcoming the natural bias toward the future\nin practical reasoning. Since we cannot change the past but think of\nourselves as still able to do something about the future, our\npractical attention is understandably future directed. But if the\nquestion is about the value of our life overall, events in\nthe past matter just as much as those in the future, and disregarding\nthem is a mistake, at best, and a case of motivated reasoning or\ndishonesty, if we are exploiting future-bias to ignore aspects of\nourselves we would rather not own up to (General form: \u201cWhew! At\nleast I\u2019ll never have to go through that\nagain\u2026\u201d). By imaginatively locating our entire life once\nagain in the future, the thought experiment can mobilize the resources\nof our practical self-concern to direct an evaluative judgment onto\nour life as a whole. Similar considerations motivate the constraint of\nsameness (2). If my assessment of myself simply\nelided any events or features of my self, life, or world with\nwhich I was discontent, it would hardly count as an honest, thorough\nself-examination. The constraint that the life I imagine to recur must\nbe the same in every detail is designed to block any such\nelisions.\n\nAs Reginster (2006: 222\u20137) observes, it is more difficult to\nexplain the role of the third constraint, eternity. It is\nnevertheless clear that it does make a practical difference: to put a\nsharp point on it, return to Clark\u2019s marriage analogy; one might\nwell be very happy to live one\u2019s marriage again (once, or twice,\nor even several times), but still prefer some variation in spousal\narrangements over the course of eternity\u2014indeed, Milan Kundera\n(1991) seems to be putting his character Agnes in something like that\nsituation in his use of the Nietzschean thought experiment early on in\nImmortality. Reginster proposes that the eternity constraint\nis meant to reinforce the idea that the thought experiment calls for\nan especially wholehearted form of\naffirmation\u2014joy\u2014whose strength is measured by the\ninvolvement of a wish that our essentially finite lives could be\neternal. More modestly, one might think that Nietzsche considered it\nimportant to rule out as insufficient a particular kind of\nconditional affirmation, suggested by the Christian\neschatological context, which would leave in place the judgment that\nearthly human life carries intrinsically negative value. After all,\nthe devout Christian might affirm her earthly life as a test of\nfaith, which is to be redeemed by an eternal heavenly reward\nshould one pass that test\u2014all the while retaining her commitment\nthat, considered by itself, earthly life is a sinful condition to be\nrejected. Imagining that my finite life recurs eternally\nblocks this avenue (and returns the focus of assessment to the finite\nfeatures of real life) by supposing that there will never be a point\nat which one could pretend that finite life is once and for all\n\u201cover and done with\u201d (Anderson 2005: 198, 203; 2009:\n237\u20138).\n",
