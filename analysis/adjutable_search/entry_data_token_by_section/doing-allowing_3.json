Causing and Not Causing Not to Occur\n\nOne natural suggestion is that the agent who does harm causes it to\noccur; whereas the agent who allows harm doesn\u2019t cause it, but\nsimply fails to prevent it where she could have done\n so.[9]\n This suggestion has immediate moral implications. It seems true by\ndefinition (almost) that you can be causally responsible only for\nupshots that you cause. And it is arguably true that you can be\nmorally responsible only for what you are causally responsible\nfor.\n\nThis argument gets into trouble when we reflect on the fact that we\nare often responsible for upshots we allow: the death of the\nhouseplants or the child\u2019s illiteracy. When we notice that, in\nthese cases, the plants die or the child remains uneducated because of\nsome failure on the agent\u2019s part, it becomes clear that the\nagent does, in some sense, cause the upshots. Moreover, most widely\naccepted contemporary accounts of causation imply that some event or\nfact involving these agents causes the deaths or illiteracy. For\nexample, the counterfactual account of causation\u2014according to\nwhich (very roughly) event E causes F if and only if\nhad E not occurred F would not have occurred\neither\u2014implies that it was the agent\u2019s failure to water\nthe plants that caused the\n deaths.[10]\n John Mackie\u2019s INUS\n condition[11]\u2014according\n to which E causes F if and only if E is\na(n insufficient but) necessary part of a(n unnecessary but)\nsufficient condition for F\u2014implies that the fact that\nthe agent failed to water the plants causes the plants to\n die.[12]\n\nReflecting on this may lead us to distinguish a wide sense of\ncausation (where S causes X if and only if\nS is causally relevant to X) from a narrow sense of\ncausation. Bronner (2018) argues that an agent causes an outcome in\nthis narrower sense of causation just if his behaviour falls on the\ndoing side of the doing/allowing distinction. He argues that\nrecognising two notions of causations explains why we are inclined to\nassert both (a) the claim that the agent who merely allows harm does\nnot cause harm and (b) claims that e.g. the agent caused the house\nplant to die by failing to water it. Unfortunately, these assertions\nare explained in a way that suggests that appeal to causation will not\nhelp us defend the moral relevance of the distinction between doing\nand allowing harm.\n",
