    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n5. Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nThe influence of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance was\nextensive and was found in most disciplines, in literature and art as\nwell as in philosophy and science. Here only the highlights of that\ninfluence can be given (see further Heninger 1974, Celenza 1999,\nCelenza 2001, Kahn 2001, Riedweg 2005, Hicks 2014 and Allen 2014, to\nall of whom the following account is indebted). It is crucial to\nrecognize from the beginning that the Pythagoras of the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance is the Pythagoras of the Neopythagorean tradition, in\nwhich he is regarded as either the most important or one of the most\nimportant philosophers in the Greek philosophical tradition. Thus,\nRalph Cudworth, in The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse asserted that \u201cPythagoras was the most eminent of\nall the ancient Philosophers\u201d (1845, II 4). This is a far cry\nfrom the Pythagoras that can be reconstructed by responsible\nscholarship. Riedweg has put it well: \u201cHad Pythagoras and his\nteachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with\nPlato\u2019s philosophy, and had this \u2018palimpsest\u2019 not in\nthe course of the Roman empire achieved unchallenged authority among\nPlatonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the\nMiddle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the\npre-Socratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating\u201d (2005,\n128).\n",
