Laws of Nature\n\nOn a number of occasions Boyle assures us that \u201cGod [is] the\nAuthor of the universe & free Establisher of the Laws of motion,\nwhose generall Concourse is necessary to the conservation &\nEfficacy of every particular Physicall Agent\u201d (BP 2:132). The\ntrouble is, he seems to have thought that this remark was fairly\ntransparent, and does not trouble to explain it to us. Moreover, he\ntends to use much the same phraseology on each occasion he discusses\nthe issue. It was a commonplace of the time that Boyle was no stylist\n\u2014 it was obvious at times to Boyle himself \u2014 but though\neven the obsequious Budgell remarked that Boyle was \u201ctoo wordy\nand prolix,\u201d in this case at least he was not wordy enough\n(Budgell 1732, 124).\n\nIt is tempting to suppose that Boyle must have had some reasonably\nwell thought out views on the question of how God sustains\nthe world. He was after all one of the most impatient of thinkers when\nit came to fake or non-explanations, and he was in general very aware\nof the danger of letting verbal \u2018explanations\u2019 get in the\nway of real ones. He objected against the scholastics, for example\nthat\n\nto explicate a Ph\u00e6nomenon, being to deduce it from\nsomething else in Nature more known to Us, than the thing to be\nexplain\u2019d by It, how can the imploying of Incomprehensible (or\nat least Uncomprehended) substantial Forms help Us to explain\nintelligibly This or That particular Ph\u00e6nomenon? For to\nsay, that such an Effect proceeds not from this or that Quality of the\nAgent, but from its substantial Form, is to take an easie way to\nresolve all difficulties in general, without rightly resolving any one\nin particular; and would make a rare Philosophy, if it were not far\nmore easie than satisfactory \u2026 (BW, 5:351\u20132, Birch 1772,\n III:46\u20137).[49]\n\n\nOn the other hand, in theology he was more likely than elsewhere to\nlet things get by, since he was convinced in advance that his\ntheological picture was the right one, and he was used to stifling\ndoubts about theological claims. Writing about himself in the third\nperson as a young man he speaks of the \u201cfleeting Clouds\u201d\nof doubts which never ceased \u201cnow & then to darken /obscure/\nthe clearest serenity of his quiet: which made him often say that\nInjections of this Nature were such a Disease to his Faith as the\nTooth-ach is to the Body; for tho it be not mortall, \u2018tis very\ntroublesome\u201d (BP 37:182r). (These doubts persisted: see Hunter\n1990, 410.)\n\nMoreover, he had a well worked out doctrine concerning the limitations\nof reason, and often points out that we should not expect fully to\nunderstand God\u2019s workings, for God is, after all, \u201c<a\nBeing> of a most Primary and most singular Nature\u201d (BP 2:107,\n2:37, BOA \u00a7 4.1, p 357). (For different interpretations of Boyle\non the limits of reason see Wojcik 1997, Holden 2007 and Marko 2014.)\nFurthermore, he was willing to admit the impossibility of our\nunderstanding \u2014 at least given the present limitations on our\nintellects \u2014 even quite ordinary and lawlike matters, e.g., the\nway in which the human soul and human body interact. How God could\nhave created the world, and how it is that he can intervene in it, are\nmatters as mysterious to us as how mind and body can interact, and\nthat is a total mystery.\n\nSometimes, Boyle remarks, our ignorance of things has to do simply\nwith our lack of knowledge of the inner or hidden workings of a thing.\nHe offers his, and indeed the century\u2019s, standard example of\nclocks which may have various internal mechanisms to produce the same\nouter effects. Thus he remarks that \u201cwe know in general, that\ndigestion is made by some Menstruum or subtile substance in\nthe Stomach; th\u00f4 we know not the particular nature of that\nsubstance, (as whether it be Acid, Urinous, &c.)\u201d.\nSometimes, though, our ignorance is of a deeper, richer variety:\n\nsometimes \u2026 we are not able to conceive the\nModus of a thing, soe much as in general, or, as to\nthe possibility of it, (abstracting from the positive Proofs\nthat such a thing is) as, when we cannot conceive, how the Rational\nSoul can stop or determine the motions of the <humane> Body. And\nin this latter case, our not knowing the Modus of a thing, is\nusually more than a bare Ignorance, and inclines us to frame\nObjections against the Truth or Existence of the thing: because\noftentimes the Incomprehensiblenes of the Modus, is grounded\nupon some thing that we conceive to be in the case, repugnant to the\nLaws or Course of Nature, or to some Dictate of right Reason: as, in\nthe instance newly mention\u2019d, it seems repugnant to the nature\nof things, that an Immaterial substance, not being Impenetrable, can\nresist or reflect the motion of a Body &c (BP 1:129, 7:155v, BOA\n\u00a73.5.19, p 255).\n\n\nBoyle was impatient with the Cartesian suggestion that we might be\nable to alter the direction though not the quantity of motion, not for\nLeibniz\u2019s reason that the notion of quantity of motion required\na confusion between momentum and kinetic\n energy,[50]\n but for the straightforward reason that interfering with the directed\nvelocity required as mysterious an interaction as altering the\n\u2018quantity of motion\u2019 would. He was aware of the Cartesian\nclaim \u201cthat the rational Soul doth [not] give any motion to the\nparts of the Body, but only guide or regulate that\nwhich she finds in them already\u201d (BW, 9:379, Birch 1772,\nIV:416), but that, he felt, did not really solve the problem, for that\ninteraction was as mysterious as an energy introducing one: \u201cI\ndo as little conceive how the motions of the Conarion can\nwork upon an Immaterial soul, as how any other part of the Body can do\nit. Nor do I conceive how an Immaterial Soul can work upon the\nConarion its self, more then it can upon any other part of\nthe Body\u201d (BP 1:128 BOA \u00a73.5.15, p 253), and he notes that\nit will not \u201csuffice to object, that the human will does, in\nthese cases, not produce any new motion, but only determine[s] the\nmotions of the spirits, and by their means of the locomotive organs.\nFor to put a check, at pleasure, to the motion of a body, that does\nalready actually move in one line, and determine its motion to\ncontinue in another, that is perhaps differing from it, or even\nopposite to it; to do this, I say, without opposing to the moving\nbody, some other body, which, by its resistance and situation may\nchange its former course, is not a mechanical operation\u201d (BW,\n12:480, Birch 1772, VI:756). A change of direction, just as much as a\nchange in the \u2018quantity of motion,\u2019 is in fact as\nmysterious and inexplicable, if done by incorporeal means, as the\nintroduction of energy into the system would be.\n",
