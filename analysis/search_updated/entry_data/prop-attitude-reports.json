    "main_text": "\n1. Frege\u2019s Puzzle\n\nPowerful considerations developed by\n Gottlob Frege\n in his 1892 suggest that words within the scope of a propositional\nattitude verb cannot function as they do outside those linguistic\nenvironments. Frege presents his puzzle as one about the relationship\nbetween the cognitive value of expressions and their ordinary\nreference, arguing that the two must be distinct.\n\nFrege\u2019s puzzle can be posed as a question about propositional\nattitude attributions. (We will use the verb \u2018believe\u2019 in\nthe discussion of these puzzles. Similar puzzles arise with other\npropositional attitude verbs.) Consider, for example, Lois Lane before\nher discovery of Superman\u2019s \u201ctrue identity,\u201d\npretending that the Superman stories as actual fact. Lois is familiar\nwith Clark Kent, her fellow employee, and Superman, the hero she most\nadmires, but she does not recognize that the person she calls\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 is identical with the person she calls\n\u2018Superman\u2019. (This doesn\u2019t really do justice to what\nLois fails to realize and there are problems specifying what Lois is\nignorant of. See the supplementary document:\n\nIgnorance of Identities\n\n\nIn the text we\u2019ll simply skip over these complications.) So, we\nwould ordinarily accept the following sentences as true.\n\n\n(1) Lois believes that Superman is strong.\n\n(2) Lois believes that Clark Kent is not strong.\n\n(3) Lois does not believe that Clark Kent is strong.\n\n\nWhen we compare (1) with (2) and (3), it seems apparent that the names\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 make different\nsemantic contributions to the sentences in which they occur. In\nparticular, it appears that replacing \u2018Superman\u2019 in (1)\nwith the co-referring \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 changes the true (1) to\nthe false (4).\n\n(4) Lois believes that Clark Kent is strong.\n\n\nSince \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 and \u2018Superman\u2019 have the\nsame reference, it seems that something other than the reference of\nthe names must be relevant to the semantic evaluation of the belief\nattribution.\n\nWithout propositional attitude attributions, one might hope for a\nsimpler semantics, in which only the referent of a name is relevant to\nthe evaluation of sentences that contain it. For consider the\nfollowing pair of sentences.\n\n(5) Superman is strong.\n\n\n(6) Clark Kent is strong.\n\n\n(5) is true iff (6) is true. Indeed, it is plausible to insist further\nthat the two sentences have the same modal profile. Even if Lois and\nothers do not realize it, these sentences, given their meanings, must\nhave the same truth-value. Each involves a reference to the same\nindividual and each predicates the same property of that\nindividual.\n\nHowever, if we expect an adequate semantics to account for the\ndifference in cognitive value of (5) and (6) (Lois accepts (5) but not\n(6)), we must recognize a semantic difference in the contribution of\nthe two names.\n\nWe can get to the same conclusion by a different route. The trip,\nalthough somewhat lengthy, is worth taking. Lois is disposed to\nsincerely, reflectively, and competently accept (5) while denying (6).\nLois is, presumably, also disposed to accept the following\nsentence.\n\n(7) Clark Kent is not strong.\n\n\nIt is plausible to link an agent\u2019s sincere, reflective, and\ncompetent acceptance of a sentence with what she believes. The\nDisquotation principle, so-called by Saul Kripke in his 1979, does\njust that. (Our formulation of the principle differs from\nKripke\u2019s in providing missing time and context indices.)\n\nDisquotation.\n\nIf an agent A sincerely, reflectively, and competently\naccepts a sentence s (under circumstances properly related to\na context c), then A believes, at the time of\nc, what s expresses in c.\n\n\n(Why relativize to context and time? Suppose an agent accepts \u2018I\nam hungry\u2019 at t. It should not follow from this that she\nbelieves what is expressed by \u2018I am hungry\u2019 as uttered by\nyou \u2013 unless you happen to be the agent in question. It also\nshouldn\u2019t follow that she always persists in believing what she\nbelieves; she is free to change her mind on the matter.)\n\nGiven Disquotation, Lois\u2019s acceptance of (5) and (7) entails\nthat (1) and (2) are true. Now, as deplorable as Lois\u2019s\ncognitive state is, it seems wrong to convict her of irrationality;\nshe does not seem to believe a contradiction \u201cin the sense in\nwhich thoughtful people do not.\u201d (The phrase comes from Perry\n1977.) But then it would seem that \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 must not\nbe substitutable for \u2018Superman\u2019 in (1), else she would. If\nthe substitution of \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 for\n\u2018Superman\u2019 in (1) did preserve truth, as it does in (5),\nthen the truth of (1) (and the fact that \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 and\n\u2018Superman\u2019 are co-designating) would entail (4). But if\nboth (2) and (4) are true, then, it would appear, Lois believes a\nproposition and its negation and would thus be guilty of\nirrationality. As she is intuitively not irrational,\n\u2018Superman\u2019 in (1) is not substitutable salva\nveritate for \u2018Clark Kent\u2019.\n\nIf it seems reasonable to infer agents\u2019s beliefs from their\nacceptance patterns, thus leading us to Disquotation, it may seem\nequally plausible to infer what agents do not believe from what they\nwithhold acceptance from, leading us to Converse Disquotation\nbelow.\n\nConverse Disquotation.\n\nIf an agent A sincerely, reflectively, and competently denies\nor withholds acceptance from a sentence s (in a context\nc), then A does not believe, at the time of\nc, what s expresses in c.\n\n\nConverse Disquotation and the fact that Lois denies (6) entail that\n(3) is true. But if both (1) and (3) are true, then, it would seem, we\nshould not allow substitution of co-designating singular terms within\nthe scope of propositional attitude verb, or the threat of\ncontradiction we saw above will be brought home to us, the ascriber.\nFor substitution of \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 for\n\u2018Superman\u2019 in (1) would commit us to (4), which\ncontradicts (3).\n\nUsing Disquotation and Converse Disquotation (together with\nintuitively plausible acceptance patterns on the part of Lois,\nconsiderations of Lois\u2019s rationality, and intuitive\nconsiderations of what rationality consists in) commit us to the truth\nof (1)-(3) and the falsity of (4), and thus, it would seem, to a\ndenial of a substitution principle for co-designating singular terms\nwithin the scope of propositional attitude verbs. If both (1) and (3)\nare true, then, one would think, (1) and (4) must say different\nthings. This in turn seems to commit us to the claim that \u2018Clark\nKent\u2019 and \u2018Superman\u2019 have different semantically\nrelevant values as they occur in (1) and (2). (In distinguishing these\ntwo arguments we follow Kripke 1979. Kripke does not endorse the\nconclusion of these arguments. Instead, Kripke argues that the\nso-called Millian thesis is not to blame for Frege puzzles but an\ninadequacy in our very practice of reporting propositional attitudes.\nWe discuss Kripke further below in section 9.)\n\nIn summary, Frege calls our attention to two problems, (i) the problem\nof the apparent difference in truth-value of corresponding belief\nattributions (such as (1) and (4)), and (ii) the problem of the\ndifference in the cognitive significance of sentences composed in the\nsame way of elements with the same reference (such as (5) and (6)). If\ndistinct belief attributions indicate differences in cognitive value\nof the sentences in their that-clauses, then these two\nproblems are really a single problem, presumably with a single\nsolution.\n\n[For further discussion of these problems, see the subsection on\n Frege\u2019s Puzzles\n in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.]\n2. Frege\u2019s theory\n\nFrege held that correct propositional attitude attributions must\nindicate the way that individuals are represented by the agent (the\nagent\u2019s mode of presentation of the referent) and that\nan occurrence of a referential expression within the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb refers to a way of representing an object\nrather than to the expression\u2019s ordinary referent.\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019 as they occur in (5)\nand (6) refer to the same man, known under these two different names.\n(5) and (6) share common referents but express different propositions\nor thoughts. Those same expressions as they occur in (1) and (4),\nhowever, refer to different ways that Lois has of representing the man\nSuperman. According to Frege, this difference in reference explains\nthe difference in truth-value of (1) and (4). The ordinary sense of an\nexpression \u2013 the way that the expression indicates its referent\n\u2013 becomes a part of the truth-conditions for a sentence in which\nthe expression occurs, if that expression is used within a belief\ncontext. Within this linguistic environment, expressions refer to\ntheir customary senses.\n\nFrege held two distinct theses about terms in the scope of\npropositional attitude verbs \u2013 that they refer to the\nagent\u2019s way of representing the object and that they refer to\nthe ordinary sense. Frege unifies these theses by maintaining that the\nordinary sense is a way of representing an object. Thus he can explain\nthe difference in truth-value between (1) and (4). Propositional\nattitude verbs induce a shift in reference; occurrences of expressions\nwithin their scope refer to what Frege called their customary sense.\nWithin the scope of an attitude verb expressions refer to what they\nexpress when outside the scope of an attitude verb. So, although\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019 are co-referring as\nthey occur in (5) and (6), they are not in (1) and (4), when inside\nthe scope of a propositional attitude verb.\n\nFrege\u2019s claim that propositional attitude verbs induce a\nreference shift allows him to preserve a substitution principle. The\nfact that (1) is true while (4) is false does not show that\nsubstituting co-referring singular terms within the scope of attitude\nverbs is illegitimate; instead, for Frege, it shows that\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019, as they occur in\n(1) and (4), are not co-referring.\n\nThe difference in sense between \u2018Superman\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark\u2019 also explains the difference in cognitive value\nbetween (5) and (6). Although both sentences have the same\ntruth-value, because the constituents are co-referential, they express\ndifferent senses, because the names \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 and\n\u2018Superman\u2019 express different senses, according to Frege.\nAlthough the truth-value of a sentence depends on the referents of\nterms, the cognitive value depends on the senses attached to the\nterms.\n\n[For further discussion of Frege\u2019s theory, see the subsection on\n Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.]\n\nSo, Frege\u2019s accounts of the two problems he calls our attention\nto coincide. (1) and (4) differ in truth-value precisely because (5)\nand (6) express different propositions.\n3. Problems for the simple Fregean solution\n\nFrege\u2019s solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle has been criticized on\nseveral fronts. Some accuse it for violating semantic innocence.\n(Davidson 1968 is the locus classicus of this complaint;\nBarwise and Perry 1983 develop the charge.) Proponents of semantic\ninnocence see an expression as having the same reference in a wide\nbody of linguistic environments. In particular, \u2018Superman\u2019\nis seen as having the same reference in (1) as it does in (5).\n\nSometimes semantic innocence is just taken as a raw datum. But one\nmight also substantiate the claim by considering anaphora across\nattitude verbs. (For more, see the entry on\n anaphora.)\n Consider the following.\n\n(8) Jack and Jill went up the hill and Jack believes that she went up\nfirst.\n\n\nThere is a reading of (8) where \u2018she\u2019, as it occurs in\n(8), is anaphoric on \u2018Jill\u2019; that is, \u2018she\u2019 is\nanchored to \u2018Jill\u2019, in the sense that the reference of the\nformer is inherited from the reference of the later.\n\u2018Jill\u2019, as it occurs in (8), is outside the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb and hence has its customary reference. So,\nthen, it would seem, \u2018she\u2019 must also have the customary\nreference of \u2018Jill\u2019 and hence must refer to an individual\nand not a sense. This runs contrary to Frege\u2019s reference-shift\nclaim. More generally, Frege\u2019s theory seems to have trouble\naccounting for the truth of sentences like (8), as \u2018she\u2019\n(for example) seems to simply pick out Jill herself independently of\nany mode of presentation. (Sentence (8) tells us nothing about how\nJack represents Jill.) Soames 1989 presents a similar argument against\nthe Fregean solution, although he does not use it to argue for\nsemantic innocence directly. The point is related to the more general\nworry that Fregean accounts cannot offer an adequate account of de\nre belief. (See the supplementary document on \n\nThe De Re/De Dicto Distinction\n\n\nfor further discussion.)\n\nThe Fregean should not be terribly perturbed by these observations.\nFirst, even if we find semantic innocence a virtue, the key insights\nbehind Frege\u2019s solution can be applied without invoking\nreference-shifting. And it is reference-shifting, not the\nsense/reference distinction itself, that innocence forbids.\nFrege\u2019s key insights are that singular terms have both a sense\nand a reference, that co-referring singular terms can have different\nsenses, and that propositional attitude verbs are sensitive to the\n(customary) senses of the expressions embedded in their scope and not\nmerely their (customary) referents. Frege pulled off the last insight\nby claiming that propositional attitude verbs induce a\nreference-shift. But there are other ways to get the same result. One\nmight, for example, claim that \u2018believes\u2019 functions\nsomewhat like \u2018so-called\u2019 in (9) below.\n\n(9) Giorgione was so-called because of his size.\n\n\n(The example is from Quine 1953.) \u2018Giorgione\u2019, as it\noccurs in (9), simply refers to the man Giorgione. But substitution is\nillegitimate because \u2018so-called\u2019 refers to the expression\npreceding it and not merely the referent of that expression. So,\nsubstitution fails but not because the substitution affects the\nreference of the terms. Rather, substituting \u2018Giorgione\u2019\nwith the co-referring \u2018Barbarelli\u2019 in (9) affects the\nreference of \u2018so\u2019 in \u2018so-called\u2019. (This\ndiffers from Quine\u2019s own explanation of why substitution fails\nin (9).)\n\nSimilarly, a neo-Fregean might claim that expressions have their\ncustomary references and senses whether inside or outside the scope of\na propositional attitude verb, thus ensuring semantic innocence, but\ninsist that propositional attitude verbs themselves are in some way\nsensitive to the senses of the expressions within their scope and not\nmerely their references. Then substitution of co-referring singular\nterms within the scope of an attitude verb is blocked, as such\nsubstitution affects the semantic value of the attitude verb itself,\nbut innocence is preserved. (See Forbes 1989, 1990, 1993 for\ndevelopment of a similar idea. Pietroski 1996 argues for a Fregean\naccount that respects innocence as well, although his account, unlike\nForbes\u2019s, is developed in the Davidsonian framework.) So, a\nFregean can accept semantic innocence.\n\nFurthermore, it is far from clear that semantic innocence must be\naccepted. We cannot directly intuit that an occurrence of a proper\nname in the scope of an attitude verb has the same reference as an\noccurrence of that name outside the scope of that attitude verb. That\nis too theoretical a claim to be within the domain of intuition. It\nmust be supported by argument and we can question whether the\nphenomena of cross-attitudinal anaphora support semantic innocence. In\nhis 1969, Kaplan taught us how we can be Fregeans and allow\nquantifying into attitude verbs. (See the supplementary document on\nthe de re/de dicto distinction, op cit.,\nfor the details.) The key idea was to introduce a relation between an\nindividual-concept and the object it determines; Kaplan, following\nChurch 1951, called this D, which is a \u201cdenotation\npredicate.\u201d The same technique can be used to account for the\nanaphoric dependence of a pronoun inside the scope of an attitude verb\non a singular term outside the scope of that verb. A sentence like (8)\nwould then be read as something like: \u201cJack and Jill went up the\nhill and (there is an individual-concept c that\n\u201ddesignates\u201c Jill such that) Jack stands in the belief\nrelation to the proposition consisting of c and the semantic\nvalue of \u2018went up first\u2019.\u201d There may well be\nproblems with this account. But its mere presence shows two things.\nFirst, one needs an argument for the claim that a proper treatment of\ncross-attitudinal anaphoric relations is possible only if semantic\ninnocence is accepted. And that argument will have to show what is\nwrong with a view like the one suggested by Kaplan, as that view\npromises to show how a reference-shifting view can accommodate the\nphenomena. Second, and relatedly, one cannot refute the Fregean claim\nthat proper names have both a sense and a reference and that\npropositional attitude ascriptions are sensitive to sense and not just\nreference simply by producing sentences like (8).\n\nThe simple Fregean solution, however, faces other, more serious,\nproblems. First, the account seems to fail when we try to extend it to\nother types of attitude reporting sentences than the classical\nexamples we have considered above. One of our most common ways of\nreferring to individuals is to use indexicals and demonstratives, such\nas \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019, \u2018this\u2019,\n\u2018she\u2019, and \u2018they\u2019. It is difficult to\naccommodate the use of such terms with a Fregean theory that requires\nthat the mode of presentation is the semantic value of a singular term\nin a propositional attitude clause. (See Perry 1977, 1979 and Kaplan\n1977, pp. 529\u201336 for a development of the problem of indexicals\nand demonstratives. See Evans 1985 for an attempt to solve the\nproblems indexicals pose for a Fregean solution to Frege\u2019s\npuzzle. For more recent attempts, see Heck 2002.)\n\nFrege\u2019s solution, remember, involves two claims: that indicating\nthe sense is indicating the way the believer represents the individual\nand that belief attributions indicate the sense. These two claims seem\nto get the wrong results for propositional attitude reporting\nsentences with indexicals in their complement clauses. Consider, for\nexample, the following sentence.\n\n(10) Alice believes that I will solve an important problem in physics.\n\n\nSuppose that Bob Smith utters (10). Smith\u2019s use of\n\u2018I\u2019 tells us nothing about how Alice represents Smith; in\nparticular, it does not refer to or otherwise involve anything that we\nwould ordinarily call the sense of \u2018I\u2019. (It would\nbe strange indeed if what made the attribution true was Alice\u2019s\nstanding in the belief relation to a proposition containing the\nfirst-person mode of presentation associated with \u2018I\u2019 and\nthe semantic value of \u2018will solve an important problem in\nphysics\u2019. If there is such a first-person mode of presentation,\nthen this is what it is for Alice to believe that she\nherself will solve an important problem in physics, which is\nnot what Smith was saying in uttering (10).) Call this the problem\nof indexicals. (There is a large literature on this problem. A\nfirst wave of important work on the problem include Casta\u00f1eda\n1966,1967. 1999, Chisholm 1981, Evans 1982, especially chapters\n6\u20137, Frege 1956, Lewis 1981, Perry 1977, 1979, Stalnaker 1981.\nFor more recent important papers, see: Cappelen and Dever 2014,\nGarcia-Carpintero 2013, 2017, Magidor 2015, McKay 1986, Perry 1997,\n1998, 2001, Recanati 2007.) \n\nThe problem is that the perspective connected to a use of an indexical\nin an attitude report is not typically intended to match the\nperspective of the target of the report. For example, Jane might tell\nyou that Lois believes that he is strong, pointing at Clark Kent,\nwithout expecting the perspective associated with her use of\n\u2018he\u2019 to match in any straightforward way Lois\u2019s\nperspective. Indeed, it is quite intuitive that one might truly report\nanother\u2019s beliefs using a demonstrative to refer to something\nthat agent is not in a position to refer to demonstratively in any way\nwhatsoever.\n\nA related problem involves attributions of a common belief to many\npeople. Like the problem of indexicals, this problem raises questions\nfor the Fregean claim that a belief attribution indicates the way in\nwhich the believer represents an individual in belief. It seems\nplausible that different people associate different modes of\npresentation with the same name. If so, the following sort of sentence\nseems to prove difficult for the Fregean.\n\n(11) Many people believe that Bob Smith will solve an important\nproblem in physics.\n\n\nSomeone attributing such a belief cannot be responsible for the many\nmodes of representation that the various believers associate with\n\u2018Bob Smith\u2019. It may seem that the theory could work in\nthis case only if we could find a sense for \u2018Bob Smith\u2019\nthat does not vary from person to person and that can serve as the\nmode of presentation of that individual for each person. That seem\nunlikely. Let\u2019s call this the problem of variability in\nsense. (See Richard 1988 for a development of the variability\nproblem. See Forbes 1989, 1990 for an attempt to solve it.)\n\nFregeans should accept that the truth of (10) does not require that\nAlice think of the speaker under a first-person mode of presentation\nassociated with \u2018I\u2019 and that the truth of (11) does not\nrequire that everyone think of Smith in the same way. But, as a\nFregean, they will insist that the truth of these reports require more\nthan merely having beliefs with the relevant referential content. One\nway to pull this off is to attempt to construct a similarity class of\nmodes of presentations. We say that the truth of (10) only requires\nthat Alice think of the speaker in a suitably related way to\nthe first-person mode of presentation the attributer associates with\n\u2018I\u2019 and (11) requires only that everyone think of Smith in\nsome suitably related way to sense the attributer associates\nwith \u2018Bob Smith\u2019. The work will all be done in specifying\nwhat it is for an arbitrary mode of presentation to be suitably\nrelated to the attributer\u2019s mode of presentation. Presumably a\nFregean would want the similarity class to be defined more narrowly\nthan just in terms of co-reference. (Dummett 1973, p. 384 suggested\nthat Frege subscribed to a view where reference-preservation sufficed\nfor reports with indexicals. There is little plausibility to such a\nhistorical claim, particularly in light of Frege\u2019s comments on\nindexicals in his 1918.) Finding such a middle ground between identity\nof sense and mere co-reference may well prove to be difficult indeed.\nHowever, much of what Mark Richard says in his 1990 (discussed below\nin\n Section 6)\n about restrictions on correlation functions can be employed by the\nFregean to try to find this middle ground. So, the problems of\nindexicals and variability do not seem fatal to a broadly Fregean\naccount of propositional attitude reporting sentences.\n\nRelated to the above problems facing a Fregean view is the problem of\nintuitive entailment-successes. Suppose that Bill utters the sentence\n\u2018I am happy\u2019 and Lois believes him. Then, intuitively,\nthere is something such that Bill said it and Lois believes it. But it\nis hard to see how the Fregean can account for such apparent\nentailment-successes, precisely because of the way in which the\naccount explains intuitive entailment-failures like (1) and (4).\n\nThere are many important neo-Fregean account that have been developed\nand promise to avoid these problems, including: Church 1951, Cumming\n2008, Evans 1982, Forbes 1990, Garcia-Carpintero 2017, Heck 2002,\n2012, 2014, Zalta 2001.)\n\nMany have taken the problems presented above to show that the only\nsemantically relevant value of a singular term in the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb is its reference and so reject Fregean\nsolution to Frege\u2019s puzzle. But if we insist that the sole\nsemantically relevant value of a singular term is its reference, what\nis there to say about the intuitive difference between (1) and (4) and\nthe arguments that they differ in truth-value?\n4. The Naive Russellian theory\n\nAnti-Fregeans draw their inspiration from\n Bertrand Russell.\n Russell proposed what we might call an acquaintance-based theory of\nthought, according to which some of our thoughts are directly about\nthe individuals they concern. We follow Kaplan 1977 in calling such\npropositions singular propositions. A proposition is singular\nwith respect to an object o just in case it is about\no in virtue of having o as a direct\nconstituent. It is general with respect to o, on the\nother hand, just in case it concerns o but only in\nvirtue of having a proxy of o that determines, either\nby satisfaction conditions or otherwise, o. Russell\nmaintained that there are logically proper names, which\ncontribute only their referents to the propositions expressed by\nsentences that contain them in subject position. He thus maintained\nthat sentences containing logically proper names express singular\npropositions.\n\nBut Russell was stingy in what he counted as a genuine logically\nproper name. For Russell, only \u2018this\u2019, as a name of a\nsense datum, and perhaps \u2018I\u2019, when Russell set aside his\nHumean doubts with one\u2019s acquaintance with a self, are genuine\nnames. Ordinary external world objects cannot be named and are known\nonly by description, according to Russell. This is because one can\nhave a genuine name only for that with which one is acquainted and one\nis acquainted only with that for which misidentification is not\nrationally open and the individual\u2019s existence is certain. So,\nif one is presented with an individual and it is possible to be\npresented with that individual again and not realize it is the same\nobject as before, then one is not acquainted with that individual;\none\u2019s thoughts about that individual are, in that case, all\nindirect. This line of reasoning relies on the Fregean claim that\ncases of identity confusion must be explained in terms of a difference\nin thought-constituents. This led Russell to agree with Frege\nregarding the truth-values of (1)-(4) and agree that (5) and (6)\nexpress different propositions. But Russell still insisted that such\nthought is ultimately grounded in acquaintance with individuals,\nalbeit not extra-mental individuals distinct from the self. Frege, on\nthe other hand, maintained that all thought was indirect, in the sense\nthat a thought is about an object o not in virtue of\nhaving o as a direct constituent but rather by having\na surrogate as a direct constituent that then determined\no, most plausibly in virtue of satisfaction\nconditions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an example to better appreciate Russell\u2019s\nviews about our thoughts about external reality. Suppose that you are\nsitting before an object and say to yourself, \u201cThat apple is\ngreen.\u201d You are acquainted, Russell thinks, with the universal\nGREEN. But you are not acquainted with the apple itself, as\nmisidentification is possible. Your thought about the apple is\ntherefore by thought by description. But the description is not, for\nRussell, purely qualitative. Indeed, the description is\nindividual-involving. In virtue of your visual experience of the\napple, you are acquainted with a sense-datum caused by the apple. Call\nthis sense-datum BILL; Russell would use the demonstrative\n\u2018that\u2019, pointing inward at your occurrent sense-datum. The\ncontent of your thought about the apple, according to Russell, is then\nsomething like the following.\n\n<[the x: x causes BILL] x is green>\n\n\nThis proposition is general and thus indirect with respect to the\nexternal object (in this case, the apple), but singular and thus\ndirect with respect to the sense-datum being demonstratively referred\nto. For Russell, this is the canonical form all thought about external\nreality takes. Thought about concrete particulars is ultimately\ngrounded in acquaintance, albeit acquaintance with sense data, and\ndescriptive. (For a very intuitive presentation of this view, see\nchapter 5 of Russell 1912. For a more detailed presentation, see\nRussell 1910.)\n\nIt is clear that this is Russell\u2019s view for the contents of\nthought. It is less clear, however, that Russell was a descriptivist\nabout the semantics of ordinary proper names in public language.\nIndeed, there is good evidence that Russell thought that ordinary\npublic language names have as their sole semantic value their\nreferents and hence that simple sentences containing them express\nsingular propositions, but that most of us at least cannot entertain\nthose propositions and can only think about them under descriptions.\n(For a very nice defense of this asymmetric interpretation of Russell,\nsee Sainsbury 1993.)\n\nMore recent Russellians have, following Russell, maintained the\nobjects of our thought are, in many cases, singular propositions. But\nthey have broken from Russell in maintaining that extra-mental\nindividuals \u2013 like your apple \u2013 can also be constituents\nof the thoughts we grasp. Let\u2019s call such theorists\nneo-Russellians. (See Donnellan 1990 for a nice discussion of\nRussell\u2019s view in contrast with what we are here calling\nneo-Russellians.) Neo-Russellianism is a standard, although by no\nmeans universal, view in contemporary philosophy of language and mind.\nThere are important differences among neo-Russellians concerning what\nextra-mental objects can be thought of directly and, more importantly,\nwhich relations (perceptual, communicative, etc.) ground and are\nnecessary for direct thought. (For a discussion of this issue, see\nJeshion 2002, 2004 and the papers collected in Jeshion 2010. See also\nCrane 2011, 2013, especially chapter 6, Hawthorne and Manley 2012,\nMartin 2002, Recanti 2012, 2016. See also the supplementary document\non \n\nThe De Re/De Dicto Distinction\n\n\nfor further discussion.)\n\nAll neo-Russellians deny the Fregean idea that all cases of\nmisidentification are to be explained in terms of a difference in\nthought. Unlike Russell himself, neo-Russellians maintain that\nsingular thought is possible even for entities for which\nmisidentification is possible. The neo-Russellian cannot appeal to a\ndifference in thought contents to explain cases of rational\nmisidentification, as the distinctive claim of the neo-Russellian is\nthat the thought contents are the same precisely because the object\nmisidentified is the same and the object exhausts the thought content.\nNeo-Russellians thus need to develop a new explanation of\nFrege\u2019s puzzle.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two kinds of neo-Russellians. The first\n\u2013 what we will call Naive Russellians \u2013 insist\nthat the fundamental truth-conditions for belief attributions involve\nonly the objects and properties, not the way those items are\nrepresented. According to Naive Russellians, we are wrong to think\nthat (1) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Superman is strong\u2019)\nis true and (4) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) is false. They are composed in the same way from\nelements with the same semantic contents. Proponents of this view\ninclude Bealer 1982, \u00a739; Berg 1983; Braun 1998, 2000, 2001a,b;\nMcKay 1981, 1991; Nelson 2002, 2005; Reddam 1982; Richard 1983, 1987;\nSalmon 1986, 1989, 1995a; Soames 1987, 1989, 1995; and Tye 1978, for\nexample. (Bealer has changed his view; see his 1993. Richard has also\nchanged his view in 1989 and has subsequently become one of the most\neffective critics of Naive Russellianism. We discuss Richard\u2019s\nlater view below in\n Section 6.\n Tye seems to have abandoned Naive Russellianism. Soames has also\naltered his view, although much less drastically than the other three,\nin his 2002.) The other version of neo-Russellianism, to be discussed\nbelow in\n Section 6,\n agrees with the Fregean about the truth-values of (1) and (4) but\nrejects the Fregean claim that this difference requires a difference\nin thought content. While (1) is true and (4) is false, proponents of\nthis version of the view accept, that is not because they report\nattitudinal relations to different propositions; the proposition that\nSuperman is strong just is, as all neo-Russellians insist, the\nproposition that Clark Kent is strong.\n\nMany Naive Russellians (Bealer, Berg, McKay, Nelson, Reddam, Richard,\nSalmon, Soames, and Tye, for example) attempt to explain why people\nwrongly judge that (1) is true and (4) is false by appeal to the\ndifferent pragmatic implicatures utterances of those sentences\ntypically generate. Other Naive Russellians (Braun) do not. We shall\ndiscuss both versions of Naive Russellianism in what follows.\n\nIn communicating with one another, we have responsibilities that go\nbeyond just avoiding falsehood. For example, it is true but\ninappropriate to utter the sentence \u2018John is sober today\u2019\nif one knows that John is always sober. Uttering that sentence is\nmisleading because it suggests a contrast where there is none. But\nthat doesn\u2019t make it false. Someone who claims that the sentence\nis false is confounding pragmatics with semantics. What the sentence\nsays, as used on that occasion, is true, but uttering the sentence\npragmatically implicates something false: Namely, that John is at\nleast sometimes drunk. According to proponents of the first version of\nNaive Russellianism, confounding pragmatic responsibilities with our\nresponsibility to avoid falsehood can lead people astray concerning\nthe fundamental semantics of belief attribution. There are often\nresponsibilities for indicating the way in which the believer\nrepresents the individuals that her beliefs are about, but these go\nbeyond the truth-conditions of the attributions. Any additional\nresponsibilities are pragmatic, not semantic, requirements on the\nspeaker. They may be conditions that a speaker must ordinarily fulfill\nwhen making a belief attribution. But these conditions stem not from\nthe information semantically encoded by a given utterance of a\npropositional attitude reporting sentence but instead from the\ninformation pragmatically implicated by those utterances.\n\nThe Naive Russellian says that (4) is true (given that (1) is true and\n(1) and (4) say the same thing). But an utterance of (4) may\nnonetheless be very misleading and impart something false. Although\nLois believes that Clark Kent is strong, she would not accept the\nsentence \u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019. According to the\npragmatic explanation of why people wrongly intuit that (4) is false,\nit is based on a confusion of semantics with pragmatics, as a typical\nutterance of (4) does pragmatically implicate something false. On this\nview, then, (4) is a true but misleading report of a belief Lois does\nindeed have. Let\u2019s call this the standard Naive Russellian\nview.\n\nWe can make this proposal more precise by articulating a metaphysics\nof belief encapsulated in John Perry\u2019s distinction between\nwhat an agent believes and how she believes it. (See\nPerry 1977 for an early presentation of the distinction, where he\ncharacterized the distinction as one between thoughts and\nsenses, and his 1979, where he characterized the distinction\nas one between belief contents and belief states,\n1980, 1990, 1997, and 1998 for a fuller presentation. It should be\nnoted that Perry himself is not a Naive Russellian, although he is a\nneo-Russellian. In his early papers, he simply left it undetermined\nwhether or not sentences like (4) and (1) say the same thing, although\nStalnaker claims that Perry claimed in personal communication that he\nintended his proposal to be equivalent to the Naive Russellian\nproposal; see note 11 of Stalnaker 1981. In later work, in particular\nhis 1989, co-authored with Crimmins, Perry explicitly says that (1)\nand (4) have different truth values. We discuss Crimmins and\nPerry\u2019s later view below in\n Section 6.)\n Perry argued against Frege\u2019s solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle\nby considering indexicals in propositional attitude reporting\nsentences. His attack is based upon the Fregean\u2019s identification\nof belief contents with belief states. Perry argued that we can\nadequately account for indexicals in attitudes only when we\ndistinguish these two aspect of acts of thinking and recognize that\nthey can vary independently. Perry claimed that what one believes is a\nfunction of the belief states and environment one is in. We can\nbelieve different contents in different environments by being in the\nsame belief state and we can believe the same content in different\nenvironments by being in the different belief states. So, for example,\nyou and I are in the same belief states when we utter \u2018I am\nhungry\u2019 and yet, because of differences in our environments\n\u2013 namely, because I am me and you are you \u2013 our belief\ncontents would be different. These differences in environment do not\nneed to be conceptualized by the agent to make a difference to her\ncognitive states. You can think what I think when I say to myself\n\u2018I am hungry\u2019 by pointing to me and saying to yourself\n\u2018He is hungry\u2019. In his 1977 Perry identified belief states\n(what he there called senses) with what he called\nroles and what Kaplan called character. In later\nwork (see in particular his 1980), Perry gives this identification up\nand individuates belief states in terms of their narrow functional\nrole.\n\nUtterances of belief reporting sentences pragmatically implicate\ninformation about how the agent believes what she believes \u2013\nthey pragmatically implicate information about the type of belief\nstate the agent is in \u2013 but semantically encode only information\nabout what is believed. An utterance of (4) will typically\npragmatically implicate false information about the type of belief\nstate by which Lois grasps (and takes a positive attitude towards) the\nsingular proposition concerning Clark Kent to the effect that he is\nstrong; namely, it implicates that that belief state is linked to the\nsentence \u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019. An utterance of (1), on\nthe other hand, implicates the information that that belief state is\nlinked to the sentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. This\ndifference in implicating potential accounts for our intuitions that\n(1) and (4) convey different information. Those intuitions rightly\nrepresent the fact that there is a difference in the information an\nordinary hearer will take from a typical utterance of (4) as opposed\nto a typical utterance of (1), but they are wrongly taken to show that\n(1) and (4) themselves thus differ in truth-value.\n\nWhat can the Naive Russellian say about the two Fregean arguments\npresented in section 1? They can claim that the principle of\nrationality, according to which an agent is irrational just in case\nshe simultaneously believes a proposition and its negation, and the\nConverse Disquotation principle are false. Let\u2019s see how.\n\nPerry 1977 argues that once we accept the distinction between belief\nstates and belief contents, we should see that one can rationally\nbelieve a proposition and its negation by being in\n\u201cdistinct\u201d belief states. Lois simultaneously believes\nthat Superman is strong and that Superman is not strong. This does not\ncall her rationality into question, as she believes the first\nproposition by being in a belief state properly related to\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019 and believes the second by being in a\nbelief state properly related to \u2018Clark Kent is not\nstrong\u2019. Irrationality is believing a proposition and its\nnegation in virtue of being in the same type of state, not merely\nbelieving a proposition and its negation.\n\nThese considerations lead the Naive Russellian to reject the following\nprinciple that the first Fregean argument above relies upon.\n\nRationality.\n\nAn agent is irrational if she believes a proposition and its negation\nat the same time.\n\n\nIn its place, the Naive Russellian proposes the following\nprinciple.\n\nRationality*.\n\nAn agent is irrational if she believes a proposition and its negation\nin the same way at the same time.\n\n\nIf Rationality is rejected and Rationality* adopted in its place, then\nthe truth of (2) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is not\nstrong\u2019) and (4) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) does not entail that Lois is irrational. The truth of\n(2) and (4) entails that Lois believes a proposition and its negation.\nGiven Rationality, this entails that Lois is irrational, which is\nuntenable, as Lois cannot correct her mistake through reflection\nalone. But the truth of (2) and (4) do not entail that the belief\nstates she is in in virtue of which Lois believes a proposition and\nits negation are the same type. Thus, given Rationality*, nothing\nabout Lois\u2019s irrationality follows from the truth of (2) and\n(4). Naive Russellianism is thus compatible with Lois\u2019s\nrationality.\n\nWhat about the second Fregean argument from above, which attempted to\nderive (3) (i.e., \u2018Lois does not believe that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) and (4) from the assumption that (5) (i.e.,\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019) and (6) (i.e., \u2018Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) express the same proposition and the fact that Lois\naccepts the one while rejecting the other? The Naive Russellian can\nclaim that we should similarly reject Converse Disquotation, according\nto which, roughly, an agent does not believe a proposition insofar as\nshe sincerely, reflectively, and competently withholds assent from a\nsentence that expresses that proposition, in favor of the following\nweaker principle.\n\nConverse Disquotation*\n\nIf an agent A sincerely, reflectively, and competently denies or\nwithholds acceptance from a sentence s (in a context\nc), then, where p is the proposition expressed by\ns in c, there is a way of believing p such\nthat, under that way of believing, A does not, at the time of\nc, take a positive attitude towards p.\n\n\nThe original Converse Disquotation principle licenses inferring that\none does not believe a given proposition from a single negative\ninstance. That is, if there is one way in which an agent is presented\nwith a proposition and rejects it, then the original Converse\nDisquotation principle allows us to infer that the agent does not\nbelieve that proposition and so that there is no way of grasping that\nproposition such that the agent affirms it. Given the Perry-inspired\nmetaphysics of belief, however, that is implausibly strong, as it is\nrather like inferring that Sally didn\u2019t walk to school from the\nfact that she didn\u2019t walk to school naked.\n\nIf Converse Disquotation is rejected and Converse Disquotation* is\nadopted in its place, then Lois\u2019s acceptance patterns do not\nentail the contradictory (3) and (4). Lois\u2019s acceptance of (5)\nand denial of (6) entail that Lois both believes and withholds\nbelief from one and the same proposition, where withholding\nbelief from a proposition involves grasping a proposition in a given\nway and taking a negative attitude towards it when so presented.\nWhereas simultaneously believing and not believing a single\nproposition is impossible, simultaneously believing and withholding\nbelief from a single proposition is not. (This intermediate state\nbetween believing and not believing was first uncovered in Kaplan\n1969. See also Salmon 1995a.)\n\nAs indicated above, Braun follows the standard Naive Russellian in\ninsisting that (1) and (4) say the same thing, but he departs from his\nfellow Naive Russellians by refusing to appeal to differences in the\npragmatic potential of (1) and (4) in accounting for our \u201cFrege\nintuitions.\u201d He doubts such appeals are successful because he\ndoubts that ordinary users of propositional attitude ascribing\nsentences have the necessary sophistication to impart information\nabout how an agent believes what she believes. (Saul, in her 1998,\n1999a,b, also doubts that the sort of information described above\nconcerning belief states or how an agent believes what she believes\ncould be pragmatically implicate, or indeed communicated in any way,\nby typical utterances of propositional attitude reporting sentences.\nShe does not, however, offer Braun\u2019s positive account.) He\nagrees that there is a difference in implicature-potential between the\nunembedded sentences (5) and (6) and he argues that this difference\nitself will account for our intuitions regarding the difference in\ntruth-value between typical utterances of (1) and (4). There is no\nneed, he argues, to go on and insist that typical utterances of (1)\nand (4) convey in any way information about how Lois believes what she\nbelieves. (See Braun 1998.) In subsequent papers Braun offers rich and\ninteresting accounts of the role propositional attitude ascribing\nsentences play in explaining, predicting, and rationalizing behavior.\n(See Braun 2000, 2001a,b.) \n5. Problems for the Naive Russellian theory\n\nNaive Russellianism faces several problems. In this section we shall\noffer a quick overview of some of the main problems and gesture\ntowards possible solutions.\n\nPragmatic principles. If the Naive Russellian wishes\nto give a pragmatic account of people\u2019s ordinary judgments about\nthe differing truth-values of (1) and (4), she must clearly identify\nthe pragmatic principles that make these incorrect judgments so\npervasive. (Note: This problem will not face Braun\u2019s version of\nNaive Russellianism in quite the same way.)\n\nH.P. Grice, the father of pragmatic implicatures, offered a very\ncompelling theory of conversational implicatures. (See Grice 1975,\n1978, 1981. See also the entry on\n implicature.)\n But it is unlikely to help the Naive Russellian. Information about\nthe way the believer believes what she believes cannot, it would seem,\nbe carried as a conversational implicature because such information is\nnot calculable by the conversational participants from what\nis said and the maxims, as Grice\u2019s theory requires\nconversational implicatures to be. After all, that would require that,\nat some level, ordinary speakers realize that they are not saying all\nthey mean when they utter, under \u201cordinary circumstances,\u201d\na sentence like (1). But that is implausible. (Schiffer, in his 1987,\nlevels a similar charge, although he does not explicitly present it in\nterms of Grice\u2019s calculability condition; Salmon responds in his\n1989. See also Recanati 1993, chapter 17.)\n\nObvious permutations on Grice\u2019s notion of conversational\nimplicature, like Morgan\u2019s and Horn & Bayer\u2019s notion\nof short-circuited conversational implicatures, won\u2019t be of much\nuse either. (See Morgan 1978 and Horn & Bayer 1984.)\nShort-circuiting occurs when a nonliteral use becomes standardized.\nFor example, it is at least arguable that uses of \u2018Can you pass\nthe salt?\u2019, to take an example from Searle 1975, are standardly\nrequests for salt. According to Morgan and Horn and Bayer, this meant\ninformation is a conversational implicature. Ordinary speakers may not\nrecognize, even upon reflection, that they are speaking nonliterally\nbecause that nonliteral use has become conventionalized through\nrepetition. And even though \u2018Do you have the ability to pass the\nsalt?\u2019 and \u2018Can you pass the salt?\u2019 (at least\narguably) mean the same thing and hence utterances of them have the\nsame conversational implicating potential, because of past\nuses an utterance of the latter but not the former will naturally give\nrise to the request for the salt. Short-circuiting is unlikely to be\nof use to a Naive Russellian because it requires past uses that meet\nthe conditions for ordinary conversational implicature, those uses of\nwhich then become, through repetition, standardized. Those past uses,\nhowever, must pass the calculability condition, as they were ordinary\nconversational implicatures. But it is doubtful that there were at any\ntime widespread uses of propositional attitude reporting sentences\nthat met the necessary conditions for being conversational\nimplicatures, as it is highly dubious that ordinary speakers ever\nrealized that sentences like (1) and (4) say the same thing. Hence,\nthere was never the necessary past use as a standard conversational\nimplicature that could have become standardized.\n\nWe have argued that a proponent of (the standard version of) Naive\nRussellianism cannot employ Grice\u2019s notion of conversational\nimplicature, or any obvious permutation thereof, to account for our\nFrege intuitions. What the Naive Russellian needs is a notion of a\npragmatic implicature that does not rely upon calculability and does\nnot require the propositions semantically encoded by the relevant\nutterances to play a role in the conscious psychological lives of the\nparticipants of the conversation. How could an implicature be\ngenerated under such conditions? The following is a suggestion.\n\nThere is a widespread conflation of belief contents and belief states.\nBecause ordinary folk do not clearly distinguish these two notions, it\npossible for them to use propositional attitude verbs that express a\nrelation to belief contents intending also to impart information about\nthe belief states of the subject of the report without realizing that\nthey are speaking nonliterally. As information concerning belief\nstates is useful in explaining, predicting, and rationalizing actions\n\u2013 something propositional attitude reporting sentences seem made\nto do \u2013 and belief contents and belief states are not clearly\ndistinguished, ordinary speakers unwittingly come to use such\nsentences to convey more than they express.\n\n\nAsymmetric relations. If names are\ninter-substitutable, and if (12) is true \n\n(12) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Clark Kent.\n\n\nthen (13) and (14) must also be true.\n\n(13) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Superman.\n\n(14) Lois believes that Clark Kent is stronger than Superman.\n\n\n\nCan it really be that (13) and (14) are true and that the typical\nstrong feeling that they are false is really just a matter of\npragmatic inappropriateness? The Naive Russellian seems to have little\nchoice but to offer a positive answer. \n\nIf (13) is true, then is it also true that Lois believes that Superman\nis stronger than himself, or can we differentiate this from the\nprevious claims? Maybe we can get ourselves to accept that Lois\nrationally believes that Superman is stronger than Superman. But how\ncould a thoughtful agent believe that something is stronger than\nitself? Surely that is a violation of the requirements of\nrationality.\n\nRegarding this last problem, Salmon 1992 and McKay 1991 compellingly\nargue that believing that Superman is stronger than Superman is\ndistinct from believing that Superman is stronger than himself because\nthe proposition that Superman is stronger than Superman is different\nfrom the proposition that Superman is stronger than himself, on the\ngrounds that being stronger than Superman is a different\nproperty from being stronger than oneself. The first is a\ntwo-place relation, with the identity pair <SUPERMAN, SUPERMAN>\nas relata; the second is a one-place, self-reflexive property. (For\nmore on the difference between xRy and xRx, under an assignment of the\nsame object to both variables x and y, see Fine 2007 \n\nPsychological explanation, predication, and\nrationalization. The explanatory, predictive, and\nrationalizing potential of (1) differs from that of (4). For example,\nan utterance of (4), if accepted as true, would typically lead one to\nexpect that, when Lois is looking for some heavy boxes to be moved in\nher office, sees Clark Kent (dressed in his Daily Planet\ngarb) standing by doing nothing, she would ask him to help, etc..\nThis, of course, is the wrong result. Lois does no such thing. The\nNaive Russellian thinks that an utterance of (4) is true in exactly\nthose conditions under which an utterance of (1) is true. But this, it\nmay be thought, is hard to square with the fact that they have such\nvery different explanatory, predictive, and rationalizing potential.\n(See Richard 1997 for a powerful presentation of this objection.)\n\nThe force of this objection rests on the first problem of pragmatic\nprinciples raised above. For if that problem is solved, then the\nsolution to the problems of psychological explanation, predication,\nand rationalization will follow on its wings. Insofar as utterances of\n(1) and (4) implicate different information about the way in which\nLois believes what she allegedly believes, it seems likely that there\nwill be a very natural account of the difference in their explanatory,\npredictive, and rationalizing potential, the difference in what is\npragmatically implicated will account for the differences noted in\nthis section. So the more fundamental problem facing the Naive\nRussellian is the problem of pragmatic principles.\n\nSchiffer\u2019s iteration problem. In his 1987,\n2006, Schiffer argues that Naive Russellianism is implausible when it\ncomes to beliefs about other people\u2019s beliefs. Lois, the Naive\nRussellian claims, is rational in believing a contradiction because\nshe has two modes of presentation of Superman such that she does not\nbelieve that they are modes of presentation of the same object. So,\nLois can rationally believe the singular propositions that Superman is\nstrong and that Superman is not strong at the same time because she\nbelieves the first in one way and the second in another way. But most\nof us believe that Lois believes that Superman is strong while\nbelieving that Lois does not believe that Clark Kent is strong. So,\ngiven Naive Russellianism, most of us then believe a proposition and\nits negation and we seem to not be guilty of irrationality for so\ndoing. But, argues Schiffer, the Naive Russellian cannot account for\nthis, as most of us do not have two distinct ways of thinking of\nSuperman (or Lois, for that matter) such that we do not realize that\nthey are ways of thinking of the same individual, as most of us are\nnot ignorant of the identity between Superman and Clark Kent. So, it\nseems that the Naive Russellian\u2019s conditions for rationally\nbelieving a proposition and its negation are not met. (Salmon 1989,\n2006 contains responses to Schiffer\u2019s objection. See also Braun\n2006.)\n6. Contextualist theories\n\nMany are reluctant to accept the claim that co-referring proper names\nare intersubstitutable within the scope of attitude verbs, even when\nthey are attracted to the thesis of direct reference and the idea that\nthe contents of some of our attitudes are nothing but singular\npropositions. Thus, many neo-Russellians reject Naive Russellianism.\nThey would like to accept the intuitions that (1) is true and (4) is\nfalse while denying the Fregean claims that \u2018Superman\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 are not directly referential and that all\ncases of identity confusion are to be explained in terms of a\ndifference in thought grasped. They want it all. (5) and (6) express\nthe same singular proposition, but (1) is true and (4) is false. While\nNaive Russellians claim that the information regarding how Lois\nbelieves what she does is, at best, merely part of what utterances of\n(1) and (4) pragmatically convey, \u201csophisticated\u201d\nneo-Russellians would like that information to be part of the semantic\ncontent of the sentences in question. In this section we look at two\nbroad strategies that promise to deliver these results: The first\ndeveloped in Mark Crimmins and John Perry 1989 and Crimmins 1992a and\nthe second suggested by a view presented in Mark Richard 1990.\n\nCrimmins and Perry argue that propositional attitude reports involve\n\u201cunarticulated constituents\u201d that concern how the subject\nof the report conceives of the proposition that the report alleges\nthat she has an attitude towards. According to Crimmins and Perry, a\ntypical utterance of (1) expresses a truth while a typical utterance\nof (4) expresses a falsehood. Both attributions, they claim, say of\nLois that she believes the singular proposition about Superman to the\neffect that he is strong. But the first involves implicit reference to\nLois\u2019s \u201cSuperman-y\u201d way of thinking of Superman and\nthe second to Lois\u2019s \u201cClark Kent-y\u201d way of thinking\nof Superman. Because Lois believes that singular proposition in the\nfirst way and not the second, the two sentences will typically express\ndifferent propositions that can diverge in truth-value.\n\nCrimmins and Perry embrace a metaphysics of thoughts and thinking\nsimilar to the standard Naive Russellian\u2019s described above in\nthe previous section. The difference between the views concerns\nwhether or not the information semantically encoded by utterances of\nattitude reporting sentences is sensitive or insensitive to\ndifferences in the way a proposition is grasped.\n\nExtra-linguistic context determines what way of grasping (what\nCrimmins and Perry call an idea) an utterance of a\npropositional attitude ascribing sentence makes implicit reference to.\n(On the most plausible version of the view, a type of way of grasping,\ninstead of a token way of grasping, that is implicitly referred to.)\nThe expressions themselves (and not just their referents or semantic\ncontents) are, however, typically relevant to what way of grasping is\nimplicitly referred to. So, although substitution of co-referring\nnames does not affect the proposition the propositional attitude\nascribing sentence claims the target of the report to have an attitude\ntowards, as it does on the Fregean view, in some cases it affects what\nway of grasping is implicitly referred to and hence is capable of\naffecting truth-value of a propositional attitude ascribing sentence.\n(Some call views of this kind \u201chidden-indexical theories\u201d\nbecause the sentence does not contain a syntactic element that\nexplicitly refers to a way of thinking. See Schiffer 1992, p. 503.\nSchiffer offered a version of this view in his 1977, as did Brian Loar\n1972. Greg Fitch also presented a similar view in his 1984 and 1987.\nWe focus on Crimmins and Perry\u2019s version, which is the most\nfully developed version of the view.)\n\nCrimmins and Perry offer a way of insisting that the objects of many\nof our attitudes are singular propositions while still denying the\nsubstitution principle. They can thus accept all of the auxiliary\nprinciples and claims used to generate Frege\u2019s puzzle (i.e.,\nDisquotation, Converse Disquotation, the principle of Rationality,\netc.) and, like Frege, deny that the co-reference of\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 licenses their\ninter-substitution in (1), while still claiming that\n\u2018Superman\u2019, as it occurs in (1), and \u2018Clark\nKent\u2019, as it occurs in (2), are directly referential. The view\nseems to give us all that we could want: It respects our Fregean\nintuitions about truth-values without the sins of accepting a\nsense/reference distinction for singular terms like proper names,\ndemonstratives, and indexicals. (The view is further developed and\nrefined in Crimmins 1992a,b and 1993.)\n\nCrimmins and Perry\u2019s view has been subject to criticism. We\nshall here briefly present only one line of objection. (See Bach 1993,\nClapp 1995, Reimer 1995, Richard 1993, Rieber 1995, and Saul 1992.\nCrimmins responds to some of these objections in his 1992a, 1995a.\nSchiffer objects to Crimmins and Perry\u2019s view in his 1992 and\n1994 on the basis that \u2018believes\u2019 and other propositional\nattitude verbs do not express three-place relations, as their view\nrequires. Ludlow responds to Schiffer\u2019s \u201clogical\nform\u201d objection in his 1995, 1996. Schiffer responds to Ludlow\nin his 1996.)\n\nMany are attracted to the claim that contextual supplementation of\nwhat\u2019s said is always traceable to some syntactic element; that\nis, the information semantically encoded by an utterance must have the\nsame structure as the syntactic form of the sentence uttered. Call\nthis the the principle of linguistic constraint. (See, for\nexample, Stanley 2000, 2002 for a defense of this constraint. Recanati\n2002 and Carston 1998, 2002, 2016 offer very sensitive defenses of\nunarticulated constituents.) One reason to accept this principle is\nthat it helps to demarcate information that is conveyed by an\nutterance but not part of what is said by the sentence uttered. And it\ndoes this in a way that solves an overgeneration problem that\nthreatens theories violating this constraint. Perhaps one can, given\nthe correct conversational setting, using the sentence\n\u20182+2=4\u2019 to communicate that one is going to the store.\nEven still, it seems plausible that the sentence itself does not say\nthat, as nothing in the sentence contributes the relevant components\nof that communicated piece of information. Crimmins and Perry\u2019s\nview is inconsistent with this principle, as they argue that\n\u2018believes\u2019 is syntactically two-place even though it\nexpresses a three-place relation. So, anyone convinced that our\nsemantic theories should be syntactically constrained will reject\nCrimmins and Perry\u2019s view.\n\nIs there a way to make the information encoded by utterances of belief\nsentences sensitive to how the subjects of the reports grasp the\npropositions, while insisting that the propositions grasped are\nsingular propositions, without making ways of grasping unarticulated\nconstituents? We can get an idea of how to do this by looking at a\nview developed by Mark Richard 1990, 1993, 1995. Like Crimmins and\nPerry, Richard offers a semantics of propositional attitude reporting\nsentences that treats them as context-sensitive, respects something\nlike neo-Russellianism (although we\u2019ll return to this below),\nand yet blocks intersubstitution of co-referring names within the\nscope of propositional attitude verbs. Unlike Crimmins and Perry,\nhowever, Richard does not claim that \u2018believes\u2019 (and its\nfellow propositional attitude verbs) expresses a three-place relation\nand does not appeal to unarticulated constituents. Richard\u2019s\nview is thus consistent with the principle of linguistic constraint.\nThe key to Richard\u2019s view is his claim that propositional\nattitude verbs are context-sensitive, expressing different two-place\nrelations in different contexts.\n\nAccording to Richard, sentences express what he calls Russellian\nAnnotated Matrices (RAMs). These are represented as tuples of\npairs of linguistic expressions and their \u201cRussellian\ninterpretations.\u201d (Richard notes that strictly speaking we\ndon\u2019t want a linguistic expression but rather some kind of\ninternal representation to deal with cases like Kripke\u2019s\nPaderweski case. See the discussion below in\n Section 8.)\n The pairs are called annotations. RAMs serve as both the\nsemantic contents of sentences and the contents of beliefs. According\nto Richard\u2019s account, (1), for example, is true relative to some\ncontext c and a world of evaluation w just in case\nLois has a thought in w that is properly represented\n(relative to the standards in effect in c) by the sentence\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019. The conversational setting generates\nrestrictions on what words and sentences are proper translations of\nthe representations of the alleged believer. Richard calls these\nrestrictions on correlation functions. Correlation functions\nmap annotations (used by the belief reporter) onto (sets of)\nannotations (employed in the alleged believer\u2019s beliefs). The\nsentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 properly represents\nsome thought p of Lois\u2019s (relative to the restrictions\nin force in some context c) just in case a correlation\nfunction maps the RAM expressed by \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 to\np that respects the relevant restrictions in force in\nc. Now, as there are contexts (and indeed, ordinary contexts\nwill be just like this) in which \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019 are associated with different\nrestrictions, we cannot substitute \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 for\n\u2018Superman\u2019 in (1) and preserve truth. Lois may well have a\nthought that can be appropriately represented, given the restrictions\nin the place in the context, by the first sentence but not the second.\nSo, there is no problem in saying that (1) is true while (4) is\nfalse. (One of the distinctive differences between Richard and\nCrimmins concerns the specifications of the internal\nrepresentations. Roughly, Richard thinks that a correct report only\ndescribes or \u201cmatches\u201d the target mental representational of the\nsubject, while Crimmins claim that a reporter refers to the mental\nrepresentation. For more, see Crimmins 1995b and Richard 1993a.)\n\nRichard\u2019s view is not a version of neo-Russellianism. This is\nbecause, on his view, the contents of propositional attitudes are not\nsingular propositions. Instead, the content of the belief that\nSuperman is strong, for example, contains the pair of Superman himself\nand something that plays the role of a mode of presentation \u2013\nthe annotation. But Richard\u2019s view can be altered in such a way\nas to still retain its core features while being neo-Russellian,\ntreating the contents of propositional attitudes and the contents of\nsentences containing proper names as singular propositions. The\nresulting view is in many ways superior to Richard\u2019s view. Begin\nby assuming the Perry-inspired metaphysics of thought sketched\nearlier, in which we distinguish thought contents from thought states.\nWe can then conceive of Richardian correlation functions as maps from\ncomplement clauses to thought states, preserving content. The content\nof both (5) and (6) is the singular proposition that Superman flies.\nLois believes that proposition in virtue of being in a belief state\nrelated to \u2018Superman flies\u2019 but not \u2018Clark Kent\nflies\u2019. So, in a belief ascribing context in which the\ncomplement clauses are intended to represent the way by which the\nagent believes what she is claimed to believe, (1) is true and (4) is\nfalse. We can then have a neo-Russellian theory of the contents of the\nattitudes and semantics of singular terms like proper names,\nindexicals, and demonstratives that respects Fregean intuitions about\nthe truth-values of (1)-(4) and is free of a commitment to\nunarticulated constituents. The view promises to offer a more\nplausible account of when two agents \u201cbelieve the same\nthing,\u201d which Richard\u2019s own fine-grained account of the\ncontents of attitudes cannot, as our intuitions about when two agents\ncount as believing the same thing are often insensitive to difference\nin how agents believe what they believe. Such an account seems to be\nthe most promising way to count (1) true and (4) false.\n\nBoth Richard\u2019s account and the modified neo-Russellian version\nof that account sketched above face a serious problem: The problem of\nconflicting restrictions. (See Sider 1995 and Soames 1995.) To build\nup to the objection, consider cases in which a speaker is ascribing\nbeliefs to different agents. It may be common ground that those agents\nconceive of matters differently. In such a case, the speaker may\nintend the same complement clause to represent different types of\nbelief states for different agents. Consider the following case as an\nexample. Suppose that Bob and Susan are looking at a picture of Bill\nClinton. Bob might then use the complement clause \u2018that he\n[pointing at the picture] was president\u2019 to represent a\nfirst-person belief state when ascribing beliefs to Bill Clinton and a\ndifferent type of belief state, certainly not a first-person belief\nstate, when ascribing beliefs to George Bush. After all, we can\nimagine Frege-style cases in which the type of belief state Bob\nintends to specify might be essential to the point of his speech.\n\nWe can now move to the problem of conflicting restrictions. Suppose\nnow that the ascriber is confused about the identities of the subject\nof the report. So, for example, suppose Lois is ascribing beliefs to\nSuperman and Clark Kent. Because she believes that Superman is not\nClark Kent, she takes herself to be ascribing beliefs to two different\npeople, depending on how she conceives of Superman. But then we can\nimagine circumstances, similar to the ones with Bob and Susan\ndescribed above, in which her intentions generate conflicting\nrestrictions on a single complement clause. So, for example, Lois\nmight intend \u2018he\u2019, pointing at a picture of Lex Luthor, in\n\u2018that he is evil\u2019 to represent a visual/perceptual\ndemonstrative when ascribing beliefs to Superman and a\nnondemonstrative, great-deeds conception of Luthor when ascribing\nbeliefs to Clark Kent. (Suppose that Lois believes that Superman knows\nof Lex Luthor personally, from his interactions with him, whereas\nClark Kent only knows about Lex Luthor through newspaper reports and\nthe testimony of others.) So, when Lois says, \u201cSuperman believes\nthat he [pointing at the picture of Luthor] is evil,\u201d she\nintends to convey that Superman has a belief to the effect that he\n[visual presentation of Luthor] is evil and when she says,\n\u201cClark Kent believes that he [pointing at the picture of Luthor]\nis evil,\u201d she intends to convey that Clark Kent has a belief to\nthe effect that such-and-so criminal mastermind is evil. This is\nproblematic for Richard because these restrictions conflict and so\nthere is no correlation function that respects all the operative\nrestrictions. As a result, any belief attribution Lois might make in\nsuch a conversational setting to Superman/Clark Kent with a complement\nclause containing \u2018he [visual presentation of Luthor]\u2019 as\nsubject is false. Even \u2018Superman believes that he [visual\npresentation of Luthor] is self-identical\u2019 is false. This is\nintuitively unacceptable. Although Lois is confused, she can\nintuitively still say a few true things about Superman\u2019s beliefs\nconcerning Lex Luthor.\n\nRichard responds to this problem in his 1995 by claiming that when\nthere are conflicting restrictions operative in a context, a relevant\nsentence is true in the context just in case it is true on every\nresolution of the conflict. Nelson 2002, 2005 criticizes\nRichard\u2019s response, arguing that it still does not accommodate\nall intuitive truth-value judgments, as it still counts false some\nutterances that are intuitively true.\n\nBoth Crimmins and Perry\u2019s account and Richard\u2019s account\nhave a similar goal: Accept the intuitive judgments of the truth-value\nof sentences like (1)-(4) without accepting the Fregean claim that the\nbelief that Superman is strong is distinct from the belief that Clark\nKent is strong. We have, however, seen reasons to doubt that either\nsucceeds in realizing this goal.\n7. Denying the assumption of structured-propositionalism\n\nAll of the accounts considered above \u2013 both Frege\u2019s\naccount, the neo-Fregean accounts, and the various versions of\nneo-Russellianism, from Naive Russellianism to Crimmins and\nPerry\u2019s view and Richard\u2019s view \u2013 share a common\nassumption of structured-propositionalism, according to which\nthe objects of thought are propositions, which are public,\nlanguage-independent, abstract entities with a structure that mirrors,\nto some degree, the syntactic structure of the natural language\nsentences that express them. This assumption is very widely, although\nnot universally, made by contemporary philosophers of language and\nmind. But many have found propositionalism problematic. There are a\nhost of problems that have been raised, some ontological, some purely\nsemantic. For example, some have found propositions to be unduly\nmysterious objects, having no place in a naturalistic world. Sometimes\nthis is part of a general rejection of abstract entities and other\ntimes a rejection of intensional entities in particular. Others have\nfound propositions to lack acceptable individuation conditions. And\nothers have been moved by the so-called unity problem that\nultimately led Russell to abandon propositions as the contents of the\nattitudes in favor of his multiple judgment theory. Finally, some have\nthought that the propositionalist assumption stands in the way of an\nacceptable solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle.\n\nIn this section we survey accounts that deny\nstructured-propositionalism. There are two broad categories of such\ntheories: The first denies propositionalism, according to which\npropositions are the objects of the attitudes. The most natural,\nalthough not the only, way to deny propositionalism is to embrace some\nform of sententialism, according to which belief attributions\nrelate a person to some kind of linguistic entity. The second accepts\na commitment to the propositionalist\u2019s claim that the objects of\nthought are public, language-independent, abstract entities, but\ndenies that these entities are structured. The most natural, although,\nagain, not the only, way to deny structure is to identify\nsets of possible worlds, or functions from worlds to truth values,\nwith the objects of thought. We shall consider sententialism and the\ndenial of structure in turn.\n\nFirst sententialism. The simplest form of sententialism, roughly\ninspired by Rudolph Carnap\u2019s analysis of belief sentences,\nclaims that what we have been calling \u201cpropositional\nattitudes\u201d are really attitudes towards sentences. (See, for\nexample, Carnap 1947 [1958]. Quine too was a proponent of this view.\nSee, for example, his 1956.) On this view, (1) is analyzed as\n(15),\n\n(15) Lois believes-true \u2018Superman is strong\u2019\n\n\nwhere \u2018believes-true\u2019 expresses a primitive relation\nbetween an agent and a sentence. (Similar relations will have to be\nintroduced to correspond to \u2018hopes-true\u2019,\n\u2018desires-true\u2019, etc..)\n\nThis proposal obviously won\u2019t do. As Church famously pointed out\n(see Church 1943, p. 45), construing propositional attitude verbs as\nrelating agents to sentences seems to require that the agent in\nquestion understands the language used in the report. Suppose that\nLois is a monolingual German speaker, but that everything else about\nthe Superman stories is the same. Then we\u2019d still be inclined to\ncount (1) as true. But (15), which is proposed to analyze (1), is\nobviously false, as Lois bears no relation whatsoever to the English\nsentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019.\n\nProponents of sententialism are well aware of the problem. But it is\nmuch less obvious that they have succeeded in solving it. Carnap (see\nCarnap 1947 [1958], supplement C) responds to Church\u2019s objection\nby claiming that the proposal need not require that the agent\nbelieve-true the very sentence contained in the complement clause, but\nonly some sentence or other that bears some relation (Carnap calls it\n\u2018B\u2019) to the sentence the ascriber uses. But this\nrelation can\u2019t simply be left unanalyzed. And one cannot analyze\nit in terms of believing-true a sentence that expressing the same\nproposition or worse still believing the proposition expressed by the\nembedded sentence, on pains of reverting to the thesis of\npropositionalism that the theory was designed to avoid.\n\nIt seems plausible that some non-language-using animals have\npropositional attitudes or at least that some attitude ascribing\nsentences about non-language-using animals are true. For example, it\nseems that the dog wants to go out when she scratches at the door and\nthat the cat believes food is on its way when she hears the can being\nopened and comes rushing in to eat. But it seems implausible to\nanalyze these cases in terms of these creatures being related to\nsentences, as nonhuman animals almost certainly do not believe true\nsentences.\n\nQuine famously responded to this problem by writing: \u201cWe may\ntreat a mouse\u2019s fear of a cat as his fearing true a certain\nEnglish sentence. This is unnatural without being therefore wrong. It\nis a little like describing a prehistoric ocean current as\nclockwise\u201d (1956, p. 186). Although an excellent turn of the\npen, it seems clear that the worry is in no way answered. Ascribing a\nclockwise current to a prehistoric ocean does not require the\nexistence of clocks in prehistoric time, any more than our using\nactual resources to describe a counterfactual circumstance in which,\nsay, there are no words requires that there are words in that\ncounterfactual circumstance. But this is a false comparison to the\ncase of treating a mouse\u2019s fear of a cat as fearing true an\nEnglish sentence when one is certain the mouse doesn\u2019t\nunderstand English. In the case of non-language-using animals we\naren\u2019t using features of context to fix a content that we then\nevaluate at contexts without those features, as we are in the kinds of\ncases Quine draws our attention to. It is still hard to see how a\nmouse can fear- or believe-true any sentences, English or otherwise,\neven though it can fear a cat and believe that it is dangerous.\n\nDonald Davidson 1968 proposed a more complex version of sententialism.\nAlthough his account was first proposed as an account of indirect\ndiscourse (i.e., of sentences like \u2018Bill said that the\nproposition won\u2019t pass\u2019), it has been extended to a\ngeneral theory of propositional attitudes. (Davidson himself hinted at\nsuch in extension in the opening paragraph of his original paper.) We\nbegin with indirect speech reports. Roughly, Davidson claims that a\nsentence like (16) has as its true logical form (17) below.\n\n(16) Galileo said that the earth moves.\n\n\n(17) Galileo said that. The earth moves.\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea is that \u2018that\u2019 in (16) functions as\na demonstrative that refers to the utterance of the sentence that\nfollows. So an utterance of (16) is really an utterance of two\nsentences, one with a demonstrative that then refers to the utterance\nthat follows. Galileo need not have uttered the exact sentence\ndemonstratively referred to for an utterance of (16) to be true.\nInstead, he must have uttered a sentence that \u201csamesays\u201d\nthe utterance demonstratively referred to. So the account may seem to\nhold the promise of overcoming Church\u2019s translation argument.\nThis is called the paratactic account of indirect speech\nreports.\n\nExtending the paratactic account of indirect speech reports to\npropositional attitude reports more generally may seem\nstraightforward. (1) is claimed to have the logical form of (18)\nbelow.\n\n(18) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nAn utterance of (1) is then seen to assert of Lois that she has a\nbelief whose content is captured by the ascriber\u2019s utterance of\nthe sentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019.\n\nThe truth of (1) plus the true identity statement \u2018Superman is\nClark Kent\u2019 is compatible with (4)\u2019s falsity. This is\nbecause (18) plus the true identity statement does not entail (19)\nbelow.\n\n(19) Lois believes that. Clark Kent is strong.\n\n\nThe two occurrences of \u2018that\u2019 in (18) and (19) do not\nrefer to the same utterance and so there is no guarantee that the two\nutterances samesay the same things. So, the account respects the\nintuitive truth-value judgments of (1)-(4).\n\nThe paratactic account, both solely as an account of indirect speech\nreports and as an account of propositional attitude reports more\ngenerally, has been subject to a wide range of criticisms. (For a\nsampling, see Bigelow 1980, Blackburn 1975, Burge 1986, Clapp 2002,\nMcFetridge 1980, Rumfitt 1993, and especially Schiffer 1987b, pp.\n122\u201338. See Lepore and Loewer 1989 for a defense.) First, there\nare languages where the apparent complementizer \u2013\n\u2018that\u2019, in English \u2013 is not homophonic with a\ndemonstrative. How deep this problem is depends on how seriously the\nparatactic account is about taking surface syntactic form as some kind\nof guide. One might claim that \u2018believes\u2019 (and its\nfellows) express a two place relation between an agent and some kind\nof utterance-like entity, where the embedded sentence functions as a\nrepresenter of the utterance-like entity that the agent in question\nbears the relation to. There is no need, at least not without other\nassumptions, that the apparent complementizer itself function as a\ndemonstrative. And even if there is a need for the complementizer\nitself to function as a demonstrative, there is no need for\nit to be a demonstrative.\n\nSecond, and we think far more telling, there are entailment relations\nthat are intuitively valid that the account counts as invalid and for\nprecisely the same reasons that it counts invalid the intuitively\noffending entailments involved in Frege cases. Recall how the account\ninvalidates substitution of co-referring names within the scope of\n\u2018believes\u2019 sketched above. The same kind of reasoning\nwill, it seems, also lead one to think that the following is\ninvalid.\n\n(A) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nSo, (B) Lois believes that. Superman is strong.\n\n\nJust as the two occurrences of \u2018that\u2019 in (15) and (16)\nrefer to different utterances, so too the different occurrences of\n\u2018that\u2019 in (A) and (B) refer to different utterances. But\nsomething has evidently gone wrong if (A) does not entail (B). (This\nargument mirrors Kaplan\u2019s argument the claim that the primary\nbearers of semantic contents are sentences-in-context, as opposed to\nutterances, which are concrete events. See Kaplan 1977.) This problem\ncan be avoided if, following Rumfitt 1993, utterance-types as opposed\nto utterance-tokens are seen to be the referent of\n\u2018that\u2019.\n\nBut there are other entailment relations that are also problematic for\nthe paratactic account and are not avoided by Rumfitt\u2019s move.\n(Similar points are made by Burge 1986 and Schiffer 1987b.)\nIntuitively, (1) entails (20).\n\n(20) There is something that Lois believes.\n\n\nAnd consider the following entailment relations.\n\n(C) Superman said something funny.\n\n(D) Lois believes what Superman said.\n\nSo, (E) Lois believes something funny.\n\n\nand \n\n(1) Lois believes that Superman is strong.\n\n(F) Superman exists.\n\nSo, (G) There is someone such that Lois believes that he is strong.\n\n\nAll of these are invalid if they are analyzed according to the\nparatactic analysis, whereas they are intuitively valid. This is\nstrong evidence against the paratactic analysis, especially as that\naccount is designed to respect our intuitive validity judgments.\n\nLepore and Loewer 1989 respond to these entailment problems. They try\nto deal with all but the last, which concerns the relationship between\nso-called de dicto belief and de re belief (see the\nsupplementary document, The De Re/De Dicto\nDistinction, op. cit.), by showing how the validity of the\nentailment is preserved by the addition of a premise that it is\nplausible to say we simply take for granted in assessing the validity\nof the entailments displayed above. The success of their strategy\ndepends on the plausibility of the original entailment intuitions\nturning on our implicitly assuming the additional premise in\nquestion.\n\nThere is a final problem that faces the paratactic account that we\nshall briefly discuss. (See Schiffer 1987b.) The key idea behind the\nparatactic view is that the utterance of the embedded sentence serves\nas a surrogate for some entity that the report then asserts the\nsubject of the report bears some relation of samesaying to. But this\nis problematic for at least two reasons. First, the proponent of the\nparatactic account owes an account of when two utterances samesay one\nanother. And, as was the case with Carnap\u2019s proposal, this\naccount cannot make appeal to a proposition which both utterances bear\nsome relation to in virtue of which they samesay one another, on pains\nof the view collapsing into a version of a propositionalist view.\nDavidson thought he had such an account by treating a Tarskian theory\nof truth as a theory of meaning. (See his 1967.) Although there is no\nquestion of doing the issue justice here, Davidson\u2019s work\nproposed that the primary aim of a theory of meaning is to explain\nspeaker competence and in particular the knowledge by which speakers\ncan understand a potentially infinite number of sentences. He thought\nthat a Tarskian truth theory did just that. Although there are still\npractitioners of Davidsonian semantics, the view has been the subject\nof criticism. (Foster 1976 is the ultimate source of many of these\ncriticisms. See Soames 1989, 1992 and chapter 12 of his 2003 for a\nfurther critique of the view. For a defense of the strategy, see\nLarson and Segal 1995.)\n\nThis problem is more pressing when one moves from indirect speech\nreports to other propositional attitude reports. For, as Schiffer\n1987b has stressed, whereas (16)\u2019s truth plausibly requires the\nexistence of an utterance on Galileo\u2019s part, it is implausible\nto insist that the truth of (1) requires an actual utterance on\nLois\u2019s part. Lois might truly be said to believe that Superman\nis strong even though she has produced no utterances that samesay the\nascriber\u2019s utterance of \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. So,\nlet \u2018u\u2032\u2019 name the ascriber\u2019s\nutterance of \u2018The earth moves\u2019. If (16) is true, then\nthere exists an utterance u such that Galileo produced\nu and u\u2032 and u samesay one another.\nNow let \u2018u\u2033\u2019 name the attributer\u2019s\nutterance of \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. The truth of (1) does\nnot entail that there exists an utterance u such that Lois\nproduced u and u\u2033 and u samesay one\nanother. So, even if one can give an adequate account of when two\nutterances samesay one another without presupposing a common meaning\nor proposition they are both related to, one\u2019s work in defending\nthe paratactic account as an account of belief sentences (and other\npropositional attitude reporting sentences) is not complete.\n\nThe natural move to make in response is to try to find another token\nstate \u2013 a belief state, for example \u2013 whose existence is\nguaranteed by the truth of a sentence like (1) which can then be\nthought to enter into the samesaying relation to u\u2032.\nThis is what Lepore and Loewer 1989 suggest. But problems remain.\nFirst, even if some beliefs involve an actual episode in the\nbeliever\u2019s mind, say the tokening of some brain state that can\nbe said to samesay u, there are other beliefs, implicit\nbeliefs, for which it is implausible to insist that they are had\nbecause of the actual existence of a token state that is capable of\nentering into the samesaying relation to an utterance. You most likely\ndid not believe 5 minutes ago that there was a pink elephant in your\nroom. The view easily accommodates this fact, as it is not the case\nthat you were in some brain state that samesays my utterance of the\nsentence \u2018There is an elephant in your room\u2019. But,\nprecisely for the same reason, the view seems to not accommodate the\nfact that you also believed that there was not an elephant in your\nroom. (After all, you weren\u2019t merely agnostic on the matter,\nhaving an unsettled mind as to whether or not there is an elephant\nbefore you.) At least prior to your reading these sentences, it seems\nimplausible that you were in some token belief state that samesays an\nutterance of \u2018There is not a pink elephant in your room\u2019.\nSo, implicit beliefs still seem to be a problem for this account.\nSecond, the view seems saddled with the same problem facing\nCarnap\u2019s and Davidson\u2019s views. It is well and fine to say\nthat a propositional attitude report involves an utterance of an\nembedded sentence which samesays something that that the subject of\nthe report bears the appropriate relation to. But the proponent of the\nparatactic account owes an analysis of the samesaying relation that\ndoesn\u2019t presuppose the notion of the two tokens having a common\ncontent, on pains of the view collapsing into a propositionalist view.\nEven if one remains optimistic that a Tarskian truth theory, properly\nconstrained, will serve the purpose as an analysis of the meaning of\nutterances and then sentences, it is far from clear that one should be\nat all hopeful that a similar theory will serve the purpose of\nanalyzing the content of belief, desire, and other attitude states.\nBut then it is hard to see how the view could properly explicate the\nnotion of samesaying without relying on the idea that utterances and\nbelief states express, in some sense, propositions. And simply taking\nsamesaying as a primitive is to merely pretend to have eliminated\npropositions from one\u2019s theory.\n\nThere is an alternative account, in the spirit of the simple\nsentential accounts, first suggested by Gilbert Harman in his 1972. On\nthis view, the contents of the attitudes should be seen to be\ninterpreted logical forms (ILFs). The idea has been worked\nout in more detail by Higginbotham 1991 and especially by Larson and\nLudlow 1993. The idea is that propositional attitude verbs express\nrelations between agents and ILFs, where an ILF is a syntactic tree\nstructured with each of its nodes \u201cinterpreted,\u201d or\nassigned semantic values. Take a simple example. (21) is the ILF\nassociated with (5). (We assume, for simplicity, that the semantic\nvalue of a predicate is the set of individuals that it applies\nto.)\n\n\n(5)\nSuperman is strong. \n\n(21)\n <S, true>\n\n<NP, Superman> <VP, Superman>\n\n<\u2018Superman\u2019, Superman> <\u2018is strong\u2019,\nset of strong things> \n\n\nEven though the semantic values of all the nodes of tree structures\nassociated with (5) and (6) are the same, their ILFs differ given the\ndifferent linguistic items \u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\nKent\u2019. The account thus views the contents of propositional\nattitudes as hybrids of linguistic and non-linguistic items; i.e., the\nexpressions of the complement clauses and those expressions\u2019s\nsemantic values. And it promises to account for the intuitive truth of\n(1)-(4) by distinguishing the proposition that Superman is strong from\nthe proposition that Clark Kent is strong in virtue of the difference\nin linguistic items.\n\nClapp 2002 argues that Larson and Ludlow\u2019s account violates\nDavidson\u2019s constraint that the truth condition of a sentence is\na function of the values of its constituent syntactic units and thus,\nClapp argues, the account as a whole fails to provide an account of\nour semantic competence. Soames makes a similar point in his 2002, pp.\n150\u20132, where he argues that Larson and Ludlow\u2019s account\nfails when viewed as a part of the Davidsonian project of accounting\nfor the meanings of sentences, and thus accounting for what speakers\nknow in virtue of which they can understand arbitrary sentences with\nwhich they are competent, in terms of offering a Tarskian truth theory\nfor the language.\n\nThere are problems facing the account that are independent of its\nfitting in with the Davidsonian project. For example, Soames argues\nthat the very mechanisms by which Larson and Ludlow account for the\nconsistency of (1) and (3) \u2013 namely, by distinguishing the\nproposition that Superman is strong from the proposition that Clark\nKent is strong on the grounds that the linguistic item\n\u2018Superman\u2019 is distinct from the linguistic item\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 \u2013 proves problematic for other cases in\nwhich we are inclined to think that differences in the linguistic\nitems in the complement clauses cannot lead to a difference in\ntruth-value. One example is an application of Church\u2019s\ntranslation argument. If (1) is true, then a faithful translation of\n(1) into Spanish should preserve truth, leaving the names\nuntranslated.\n\n(22) Lois cree que Superman es fuerte\n\n\nThe ILF associated with \u2018Superman es fuerte\u2019 is different\nfrom the ILF associated with (5), just as the ILF associated with (5)\nis different from the ILF associated with (6). If the core of the\nexplanation of why (1) and (3) are consistent and, more generally, why\nsubstitution fails in the case of co-referring proper names, is that\nthe substitution alters the ILF associated with the complement clause,\nthen it would seem that the above translation, for the very same\nreason, should not be guaranteed to preserve truth. But it intuitively\ndoes. \n\nLarson and Ludlow are aware of this problem, considering it in \u00a77\nof their paper. They suggest two strategies. First they suggest\naltering the account so that the truth of (1) does guarantee the truth\nof (22). This is well and good, but it has to be done in such a way\nthat we don\u2019t lose our explanation of why (1) and (3) are\nconsistent and why (1) doesn\u2019t entail (4). Larson and Ludlow do\nnot tell us how to thread that needle. Second, they consider admitting\nthat (1) does not entail (22) and seeking to explain why (1) and (22)\ncan nonetheless be used to report the same attitude by an auxiliary\naccount. Again, this is well and good, but then they owe us an\nexplanation of why we must go to such pains to explain one set of\nentailment intuitions semantically \u2013 namely, the intuition that\n(1) is consistent with (3) and so does not entail (4) \u2013 while\nbeing so cavalier about relegating other, equally (if not even more)\nrobust entailment intuitions to a non-semantic theory. The\navailability of contextualist theories described above, and in\nparticular Richard\u2019s theory, which at least promises to respect\nboth sets of entailment relations \u2013 that is, respect our\nintuitions of entailment failures, as in the Frege-style cases, as\nwell as our intuitions about entailment successes, as in the relation\nbetween (1) and (22) \u2013 makes this second strategy all the more\nquestionable.\n\nFiengo and May 1996 argue that ILF accounts lack an adequate\nexplanation of Kripke\u2019s Paderewski puzzle. (See\n Section 8\n below.) In brief, Kripke\u2019s puzzle involves pairs of sentences\nthat, like (1) and (3), are intuitively consistent. Unlike (1) and\n(3), however, there do not appear to be different linguistic forms\nemployed in the complement clauses. Instead, extra-linguistic\ncontextual changes are employed in such a way that the same linguistic\nforms seem to indicate different states of the agent. If there is no\ndifference in linguistic items, then the ILFs are the same and so the\nexplanation Larson and Ludlow offer for why (1) and (3) are consistent\ncannot be carried over to Kripke\u2019s case. This is problematic, as\none would like a uniform explanation of the cases. Ludlow 2000 offers\na response, although it seems to us that he moves drastically away\nfrom the key idea of the initial proposal, in which the LFs are public\nlanguage entities.\n\nThe assumption of structured propositionalism has two components: The\nclaim that the objects of the attitudes are propositions and the view\nthat those items are structured. So far we have discussed various ways\nof denying the first. We shall now turn to a discussion of views that\ndeny the second.\n\nHintikka 1969, Stalnaker 1984, and Lewis 1986 are the foremost\nproponents of unstructured-propositionalism. (See the entry on\n structured propositions\n for further details.) Briefly, the idea is that propositions are sets\nof possible worlds. The proposition that Bush is president, for\nexample, just is the set of all possible worlds in which Bush\ninstantiates the property being president. (Or, to remain\nneutral on issues of the metaphysics of transworld identity, all the\nworlds in which Bush or a counterpart of Bush instantiates that\nproperty.)\n\nThere is no denying that a proposition determines a set of possible\nworlds \u2013 namely, the worlds at which the proposition is true.\nAnd for a good many semantic purposes \u2013 in particular, for\ngiving the truth-conditions of sentences containing only extensional\noperators \u2013 treating propositions as sets of worlds suffices.\nBut there are well known problems with this account when it comes to\npropositional attitudes. The most famous problem is the problem of\nequivalence. Intuitively, the proposition that arithmetic is\nincomplete is distinct from the proposition that 2+2=4. Most\n5-year-olds know the latter but can\u2019t even entertain the former.\nAs both propositions are true in exactly the same set of worlds\n\u2013 namely, all, assuming the necessity of mathematical truths\n\u2013 unstructured-propositionalism entails that they are the same\nproposition. Indeed, unstructured propositionalism entails that there\nis exactly one necessary proposition. This is problematic, as it seems\nto entail that anyone believes that 2+2=4 just in case he believes\nthat arithmetic is incomplete.\n\nThe view also seems to have all of the problems that face the\nneo-Russellianism. Because Superman is Clark Kent, and assuming that\nidentity is necessary, the set of worlds in which Superman is strong\nis exactly the set of worlds in which Clark Kent is strong. But then\n(5) and (6) express the same proposition. But, as the Frege case\nshows, there is a strong intuition, and a pair of powerful arguments\nto back it up, that an agent can believe the one without believing the\nother. Proponents of unstructured-propositionalism are well aware of\nthese problems. Stalnaker 1984, 1987, and 1988 contain extremely\ningenious attempts to solve them.\n\nWhereas proponents of possible world semantics see the contents of the\nattitudes being possible worlds, or functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values, proponents of situation semantics, developed by Barwise\nand Perry 1983, see the contents of the attitudes being portions of\npossible worlds, situations. Situations are more fine-grained than\npossible worlds and so avoid some of the problems discussed above.\nBut, as Soames shows in his 1985, the account inherits many of the\nproblems. We shall here discuss just one. Recall that one of the\nproblems facing Naive Russellianism was that\n\n(12) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Clark Kent.\n\n\nseems to entail\n\n(13) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than Superman.\n\n\nwhich in turn threatens to entail\n\n(14) Lois believes that Superman is stronger than himself.\n\n\nBecause the situation that Superman is stronger than Clark Kent just\nis the situation that Superman is stronger than himself, insofar as\nsituations are the contents of beliefs, these seem to be the same\nbelief. The situation semanticist cannot appeal to the difference\nbetween the property of being taller than Superman and the\nproperty being taller than oneself, claiming that the first\nis a two-place relation and the second a monadic property, as the\nneo-Russellian can, to distinguish the propositions. This is because a\ndifference in structure doesn\u2019t correspond, for the situation\nsemanticist, to a difference in proposition. But then the situation\nsemanticists, as opposed to the Naive Russellian, is committed to the\nclaim that Lois believes that Superman is stronger than himself. But\nsurely that is irrational! (For more discussion of the problem, see\nFine 2007, 2014, Pickel 205, Pickel and Rabern 2017, Pinillos 2011,\nand Salmon 2012, 2015\n\nWe don\u2019t claim to have established the assumption of structured\npropositionalism. But the problems facing the alternatives do seem\ndaunting enough to make that assumption a good bet. \n8. Two further puzzles: Kripke\u2019s puzzles and Richard\u2019s puzzle\n\nWe have concluded our survey of the main accounts of propositional\nattitude reports and their problems. The discussion has focused on\nFrege\u2019s puzzle. In this section we shall briefly discuss further\npuzzles that any account of propositional attitude ascribing sentences\nmust deal with. The first is a pair of puzzles that Saul Kripke\nintroduced in his 1979 and the second is a puzzle Richard introduced\nin his 1983.\n\nIn his 1980 (originally presented as a series of lectures in 1970)\nSaul Kripke argued that the reference of a name is not determined by\nidentifying descriptions a speaker associates with the name but rather\nby real world connections between uses of names and objects. In so\narguing, Kripke, among others, paved the way for the now widely\n(although not universally) accepted direct reference theory of proper\nnames. He also ran flat into Frege\u2019s puzzle. In his 1980, Kripke\nclaims to not know what to say about Frege\u2019s puzzle and the\nrelated puzzle of cognitive significance, on the one hand, and the\nproblem of negative existentials and the related problem of empty\nnames, on the other. In John Locke lectures of 1973, now published as\nKripke 2013, delivered three years after his famous Naming and\nNecessity lectures, Kripke addressed the second set of problems;\nin his 1979, he addressed the first. He did not aim to solve\nFrege\u2019s puzzle. Instead, his aim was to show that his thesis of\nnames, which he admitted seems to entail that the substitution of\nco-referring proper names within the scope of attitude verbs is\nlegitimate, is not the true source of the trouble. Kripke argued that\nthe problems could be replicated without assuming Kripke\u2019s\nthesis about names, relying instead on translation principles and\ncontext-shifting principles. The problems driving Frege\u2019s\npuzzle, Kripke aimed to show, did not concern the semantics of proper\nnames. Frege\u2019s puzzle could thus not be used to disprove any\ntheory of the semantics of proper names. Kripke presented two sets of\ncases to convince us of this.\n\nThe first case involves a monolingual (French-speaking) Frenchman\n\u2013 Kripke names him \u2018Pierre\u2019 \u2013 who hears about\na city with the name \u2018Londres\u2019. Pierre forms a good\nopinion of the city based on what he hears of it (all in French) and\nis disposed to assent to (29) below.\n\n(29) Londres est jolie.\n\n\nPierre is competent and reflective, we can suppose, and so, by an\napplication of the Disquotation principle, we get (30) below.\n\n(30) Pierre croit que Londres est jolie.\n\n\nKripke then employs a translation principle, according to which a good\ntranslation of a sentence from one language into another preserves the\ntruth-value of the original. (31) below is a good English translation\nof (30).\n\n(31) Pierre believes that London is pretty.\n\n\nSo, like (30), (31) is also true. Suppose next that Pierre moves to a\nforeign land where he learns the native tongue by immersion; he\ndoesn\u2019t learn the translation of any of the words in his new\nlanguage into French. He is confined to a rather dreary party of the\ncity he lives in and comes to believe of it that it is not pretty. The\nforeign land, of course, is London and the language he learns is\nEnglish. He is soon disposed to assent to (32).\n\n(32) London is not pretty.\n\n\nWe can suppose that Pierre is as competent in English as any\nmonolingual English speaker. We are then justified in using\nDisquotation to derive (33) below.\n\n(33) Pierre believes that London is not pretty.\n\n\nWe can go further. Suppose that Pierre positively rejects (34)\nbelow.\n\n(34) London is pretty.\n\n\nThen, given Converse Disquotation, we get (35).\n\n(35) Pierre does not believe that London is pretty.\n\n\nWe can suppose that Pierre is all the while still disposed to assent\nto (29); Pierre has not, we can suppose, changed his mind about what\nhe believed about that foreign city he learned about in France under\nthe name \u2018Londres\u2019. So, intuitively, (31) is also still\ntrue.\n\nWe have the same set of contradictions we derived earlier in\n\u201cFrege\u2019s puzzle.\u201d Because both (31) and (33) are\ntrue of Pierre at the same time and they appear to involve attribution\nto Pierre of belief in a proposition and its negation, it would seem\nthat Pierre is irrational. Intuitively Pierre is free of irrationality\nin his beliefs. (31) and (35) seem to be, themselves, mutually\ninconsistent. Yet we derived them using the same basic principles\ndriving Frege\u2019s puzzle. Because we nowhere employed the thesis\nof direct reference nor a substitution principle seemingly entailed by\nthe thesis of direct reference, Kripke concludes that simply denying\nthe thesis of direct reference is not sufficient for solving the\noriginal Frege puzzle. After all, we get the very same set of problems\nwithout that thesis.\n\nThe puzzle of Pierre relies upon a translation principle. But, lest\none think that merely denying that translation principle suffices to\nsolve Kripke\u2019s puzzle, Kripke presents another version of the\npuzzle that does not involve translation across languages. This second\npuzzle has come to be known as \u201cthe Paderewski puzzle.\u201d\nSuppose that Peter has had interactions with a politician he knows\nunder the name \u2018Paderewski\u2019 and interactions with a\npianist he knows under the name \u2018Paderewski\u2019. Peter has no\nidea that Paderewski-the-politician is the same person as\nPaderewski-the-pianist; he thinks that they are two different people\nwho happen to have the same name, or at least names that are\npronounced the same. From this assumption, we can see that we could\nemploy Disquotation, Rationality, and Converse Disquotation to derive\na set of contradictions similar to those involving Lois and Pierre\ndescribed above.\n\nNotice that the puzzle here is not that of belief but that of belief\nattributions. So, for example, Taschek 1988 is quite right to observe\nthat, no doubt, Peter possesses two separate modes of presentation of\nPaderewski under which he believes of him what he does. But this\nobservation in itself does not solve Kripke\u2019s puzzle, especially\nif we think that the public language name \u2018Paderewski\u2019 is\nunivocal, at least when tied to the relevant Paderewski, and that\nPeter is speaking the public language. (Taschek offers solutions to\nKripke\u2019s puzzles in his 1997, 1998.) This is not to say that the\npuzzle is intractable \u2013 indeed, there have been many attempted\nsolutions to both of Kripke\u2019s puzzles. (See, for example, Bach\n1997, Bealer 1993, Crimmins 1992a, Crimmins and Perry 1989, Forbes\n1990, Lewis 1981, McKay 1981, Recanati 1993, Richard 1990, Salmon\n1995a, Sosa 1996.) Rather, it is to say that in order to tract it, one\nmust give an account of propositional attitude ascriptions.\nAny adequate account of propositional attitude ascriptions must\naccount for what is going on in Kripke-style cases. And, as we have\nseen above in our discussion of ILFs, Kripke\u2019s puzzles can be\nused to raise objections to certain proposals of attitude\nascriptions.\n\nIn his 1983, Mark Richard introduced us to a puzzle that seems to show\nthat apparent substitution-failure is not confined to failures inside\nthe scope of attitude verbs. Part of the interest in the case derives\nfrom the fact that it calls into question the idea that apparent\nsubstitution-failure intuitions can be explained by claiming that\npropositional attitude verbs create intensional contexts, being\nsensitive to more than just the ordinary referential content of terms\nwithin their scope. This is because Richard describes a case in which\nco-referential terms outside the attitude verb are intuitively not\nintersubstitutable. (Jennifer Saul presents very different cases\nintended to demonstrate the same point. See Braun and Saul 2002 and\nSaul 1997, 1999, 2007.) Whereas standard Frege cases exploit identity\nconfusions of the agent of the belief alone, Richard\u2019s cases\nexploit identity ignorances of the ascriber. Suppose that Sally is\ntalking to Bill on the phone when she looks out the window and sees a\nsteamroller heading towards an occupied phone booth. Sally\ndoesn\u2019t realize that the person in the phone booth is Bill. So,\nSally is disposed to accept (36) but reject (37), despite their having\nthe same referential content.\n\n(36) He [pointing out her window at the person in the phone booth] is\nin danger.\n\n\n(37) You [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\nOn the basis of this acceptance patterns, using the principles\ngenerating Frege\u2019s puzzle, it would seem that the following are\ntrue as uttered by Sally.\n\n(38) I believe that he [pointing out her window at the person in the\nphone booth] is in danger.\n\n\n(39) I do not believe that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in\ndanger.\n\n\nSo far, nothing too surprising; so far, that is, we just have a\nclassic Frege-style case. But let\u2019s continue the story. Sally\ntries to catch the attention of the person in the phone booth to warn\nhim of the impending danger. She leans out of her window and waves her\narms madly, screaming at the top of her lungs. Bill sees someone\nwaving and yelling at him, comes to believe that that person believes\nof him that he is in danger (although, as he quickly looks around, not\nseeing the steamroller, can\u2019t imagine why), but doesn\u2019t\nrealize that it is Sally waving her arms. He says to Sally over the\nphone, \u201cThere\u2019s someone waving at me and she believes that\nI am in danger.\u201d Sally believes what Bill says and so is\ndisposed to accept (40) below.\n\n(40) The person waving at you [addressing Bill on the phone] believes\nthat you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Bill and Sally, Sally is the person waving at Bill. The\nthat-clauses in (39) and (40) are the same. Their difference resides\nin the different terms designating Sally, both of which occur outside\nthe scope of \u2018believes\u2019. Even if we accept that\nco-designating terms are not intersubstitutable inside the scope of\npropositional attitude verbs, surely they are outside the scope of an\nattitude verb. So (40), together with the fact that Sally is the\nperson waving at Bill, entails that (41) is true as spoken by\nSally.\n\n(41) I believe that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\n(39) and (41) are mutually inconsistent. Furthermore, the truth of\n(41) seems out of keeping with the idea that what a person believes\nand what she does not believe is revealed by her sincere, competent,\nand reflective acceptance patterns, as we have already seen that Sally\ndoes not accept and indeed rejects (37). And as this idea is a driving\nforce behind Frege\u2019s puzzle, those who take Frege\u2019s puzzle\nto raise problems for Naive Russellianism cannot simply respond to\nRichard\u2019s puzzle by claiming that (39) is false.\n\nIn 1983, Richard took this case to show that our apparent\nsubstitution-failure intuitions should be explained pragmatically and\nnot semantically. Otherwise, he thought, we have substitution-failures\noutside the scope of attitude verbs, which is evidently unacceptable.\nWhile (39) may seem true and (41) may seem false, this is because we\nconflate what an utterance of these sentences pragmatically\nimplicates, suggesting that Sally would accept the complement clause\nused to report what she believes. This same explanation, Richard\ninsists, should be employed in both Frege\u2019s and Kripke\u2019s\npuzzles, leading us to Naive Russellianism.\n\nIn their 1989, Crimmins and Perry respond to Richard\u2019s challenge\nby accepting that there are substitution-failures even outside the\nscope of attitude verbs. But, they claim, such failures are limited to\nself-attributions like (41), because of what they call \u201cthe\npragmatic principle of self-ascription...an utterance of \u2018I\nbelieve that \u2026t\u2026\u2019 provides (or, is about)\nthe notion that is connected to the speaker\u2019s use of\n\u2018t\u2019.\u201d (p. 708). This response assumes that\nRichard-style cases require the first-person pronoun. But that\nassumption is false. All one needs to construct a Richard-style case\nis for the ascribers to be ignorant of the identities of the\nagents they are ascribing beliefs to. (Recall the cases of conflicting\nrestrictions described above.) One can then use nothing but\nthird-person means of designating the alleged believers and get the\nsame intuitive variation in truth-values. Crimmins and Perry\u2019s\nhope that such substitution-failures will be confined to cases\ninvolving the first-person pronoun is ill-founded. Hence, if one is\nsimply going to accept the consequence that there are substitution\nfailures even outside the scope of the attitude verb, then one will\nhave to accept that consequence in an unrestricted form. \n\nRichard no longer believes that his case supports the claim that\napparent substitution-failures are best explained pragmatically. In\nhis 1990, Richard claims that the appearance of a contradiction turns\non context-shifts. Suppose that Benny says, \u201cI am hungry,\u201d\nand Paula says, \u201cI am not hungry.\u201d Anyone who attempted to\nclaim that they can\u2019t both be speaking truly would be guilty of\nshifting the context in her attempt to derive a contradiction. Paula\ndoes not deny what Benny says, but instead says something about\nherself. The context-shift is obvious in this case, as it is obvious\nthat \u2018I\u2019 is context-sensitive. The context-shift is less\nobvious, and hence more pernicious, claims Richard, in the case of\npropositional attitude verbs. Richard claims that when we judge (41)\nto be false, we are evaluating it relative to a context c\nsuch that, were we to evaluate (39) relative to c as well, we\nwould see that it too is false. (In short, we are evaluating it in a\ncontext in which the operative restrictions on correlation functions\nare such that \u2018that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in\ndanger\u2019 is not mapped on to anything that Sally accepts.) When,\non the other hand, we judge that (39) is true, we are evaluating it\nrelative to a context c\u2032 such that, were we to evaluate\n(41) relative to c\u2032 as well, we would see that it too\nis true. So, claims Richard, our intuitions turn on shifting the\ncontext. If we focus on any single context, we see that there are no\nsubstitution failures outside the scope of attitude verbs.\n\nRichard offers a similar solution to Kripke\u2019s puzzle. In\nKripke-style cases, the attributor is conscious of the\nmisidentification, and so it is plausible to claim that there is a\ncontext-shift. (Insofar as we grant that something like restrictions\non correlation functions are part of context, that is.) The speaker is\nconscious of the fact that her uses of \u2018London\u2019 in\nrepresenting Pierre\u2019s beliefs are not completely univocal, as\nshe first uses them to represent his \u201cLondres\u201d-beliefs and\nthen to represent his \u201cLondon\u201d-beliefs. But in\nRichard\u2019s case, the speaker need not be conscious of the\nmisidentification and hence will not recognize any shift in the\ncontext. She will take her utterances of (39) and (41) to be part of a\nsingle communicative exchange in which no context shifts have been\nneeded, precisely because she (that is, Sally) takes (39) to concern\none person\u2019s beliefs and (41) to concern another person\u2019s\nbeliefs. So, there are reasons to think that our intuitions concerning\nthe truth and falsity of (39) and (41) do not rely on implicit\ncontext-shifting.\n\nKripke\u2019s puzzles of Pierre and Paderewski and Richard\u2019s\npuzzle, like Frege\u2019s puzzle, provide more data that any adequate\naccount of attitude ascribing sentences must accommodate. Ultimately,\nany such account must fit with a broader theory of human interaction.\nPeople communicate their beliefs, they agree when they share a belief,\nand beliefs play a role in motivating and explaining action. Any\naccount of belief attributions must say how proposition attitude\nascribing sentences contribute to all of this, and the account must\ndividing the contribution into its semantic and pragmatic aspects.\n",
