    "main_text": "Imagination Theories || Burke\n2.2 Burke\n\nThe conception of imagination at work in Edmund Burke\u2019s A\nPhilosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and\nthe Beautiful (published in 1757 [1759]) is a successor to\nAddison\u2019s, though it has undergone expansion along one dimension\nand contraction along another.\n\nThe expansion presumably responds to a problem arising from the\napplication Addison\u2019s fundamental idea\u2014the idea that the\npleasures of taste are pleasures of visual representation\u2014to\nobjects that do not present themselves visually, such as literary and\nmusical works. With respect to such objects Addison is forced to\nmaintain either that they function mainly to prompt mental images of\nobjects that do present themselves visually, or that the pleasures\nthey afford are not mainly pleasures of taste (he takes the former\nline with respect to literary works and the latter, apparently, with\nrespect to music (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 416)). It is presumably\nto mitigate this difficulty that Burke adopts a conception of the\nimagination that encompasses all five sense modalities. Thus whereas\nfor Addison one can imagine merely how things look, for Burke one can\nalso imagine how they sound, taste, smell, and feel. Though this\nbroadened conception is not unique to Burke, it is unlikely that any\nother theorist of taste so fully exploits its breadth: each sense\nmodality has its moment in A Philosophical Enquiry,\nfrom a section on the beauty of surfaces as revealed by touch (Burke\n1757 [1990, 110\u2013111]) to one on the sublimity of \u201cBitters and\nStenches\u201d (Burke 1757 [1990, 78\u201379]).\n\nThe contraction also presumably responds to problem in Addison, this\ntime to an apparent inconsistency in the conception of imagination\nitself. Addison opposes the pleasures of the imagination to the\npleasures of sense, on one hand, and to the pleasures of the\nunderstanding, on the other (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 411). But he\nalso defines the pleasures of the imagination as those arising from\nthe visual representation of things, and allows that some of those\npleasures\u2014those he calls \u201cthe primary pleasures of the\nimagination\u201d\u2014arise from things present to vision (Addison\nand Steele 1879, no. 411). Thus it becomes hard to say what the\nopposition between the pleasures of sense and the pleasures of the\nimagination can amount to. It is presumably to relieve this tension\nthat Burke recasts Addison\u2019s distinction between primary and\nsecondary pleasures of the imagination as a distinction between\n\u201cthe primary pleasures of sense\u201d and \u201cthe secondary\npleasures of the imagination\u201d (Burke 1757 [1990, 22]).\n\nIt is a complicated question whether Burke takes the primary pleasures\nof sense and the secondary pleasures of the imagination jointly to\nexhaust the pleasures of taste. In the 1759 addition to A\nPhilosophical Enquiry (the \u201cIntroduction on Taste\u201d)\nBurke allows that objects of the understanding constitute \u201ca\nvery considerable part of what are considered objects of Taste\u201d\n(Burke 1757 [1990, 22]). But that objects of the understanding cannot be\nobjects of taste seems a guiding assumption of much of the rest of the\nEnquiry: consider, for example, Burke\u2019s claim that it\nis only as an object of the imagination, and specifically not as an\nobject of the understanding, that God can be found sublime (Burke\n1757 [1990, 62]). It is worth noting, moreover, that in other respects\nBurke\u2019s theory is more thoroughly materialist than\nAddison\u2019s. Although Addison maintains that the pleasures of\ntaste are pleasures of the imagination, his explanations as to why\ncertain objects of imagination please are not particularly\nmaterialist. He traces the pleasure we take in \u201can unbounded\nview,\u201d for example, to our regarding it as \u201can image of\nliberty\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). Burke\u2019s\ntendency, by contrast, is to explain the pleasures of sense and\nimagination by appeal merely to our physical constitution. He holds\nthe delight we take in the viewing very large objects, for example, to\nbe a consequence of the retina\u2019s being struck, all at once or in\nquick succession, by the relatively many light rays that very large\nobjects reflect (Burke 1757 [1990, 124\u2013125]).\n\nBut Burke\u2019s chief innovation consists neither in his conception\nof the imagination, nor in the extent of his materialism, but in his\ntheory of the perfections of taste. It will be recalled that Addison\nposits three such perfections\u2014sublimity (or greatness), novelty,\nand beauty\u2014though he offers no explanation as to why there\nshould be just these three. Burke argues, briefly, that novelty is too\nsuperficial and ubiquitous to keep rightful company with sublimity and\nbeauty (Burke 1757 [1990, 29]). And he argues, at length, that sublimity\nkeeps rightful and exclusive company with beauty on the grounds that\nit stands to one great class of human passions as beauty stands to the\nother (Burke 1757 [1990, 30\u201350]). According to Burke\u2019s account of\nthe passions\u2014which owes much to Hume\u2019s\u2014most all\npassions answer either to the ends of society or to the ends of\nself-preservation (Burke 1757 [1990, 35\u201336]). Moreover, all societal passions\n\u201cturn\u201d on pleasure, that is, each has either pleasure or\nits felt absence as a constituent (Burke 1757 [1990, 37]). The societal\npassion of love has pleasure as a constituent, for example, while the\nsocietal passion of grief has the felt absence of pleasure as a\nconstituent (Burke 1757 [1990, 34\u201335, 39]). All self-preservative\npassions, by contrast, \u201cturn\u201d on pain, that is, each has\neither pain or its felt absence of pain as a constituent (Burke 1757 [1990,\n37]). The self-preservative passion of simple terror has pain as a\nconstituent, for example, while the self-preservative passion of\nastonishment\u2014a passion which arises when pain threatens though\nfrom a relatively safe distance, and which combines feelings of\nsobriety, awe, and \u201ctranquility shadowed with\nhorror\u201d\u2014has the felt absence of pain as a constituent\n(Burke 1757 [1990, 32, 36\u201337, 53]). Thus there are both desirable and\nundesirable societal passions and desirable and undesirable\nself-preservative passions. The beautiful is that which excites the\ndesirable societal passion of love, the sublime that which excites the\ndesirable self-preservative passion of astonishment (Burke 1757 [1990,\n36\u201337, 39, 53]). The objective foundations of beauty and sublimity turn\nout to be largely opposing: whereas the beautiful tends to the small,\nthe smooth, the various, the delicate, the clear, and the bright, the\nsublime tends to the great, the uniform, the powerful, the obscure,\nand the somber. Hence Burke concludes that:\n\n[t]he ideas of the sublime and the beautiful stand on foundations so\ndifferent, that it is hard \u2026 to think of reconciling them in\nthe same subject, without considerably lessening the effect of the one\nor the other upon the passions. (Burke 1757 [1990, 103])\n\n\nThe impact of Burke\u2019s aesthetic dualism was immediate. Before\nits appearance, the sublime could be ignored: there is almost no\nmention of it in Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, or Hume. Afterward it could\nnot be: indeed the major theorists of the second half of the\ncentury\u2014Reid, Alison, and Kant\u2014all advance substantial\ntheories of the sublime. But toward the century\u2019s end\nBurke\u2019s dualism began to come under pressure, not from those who\nthought two perfections too many, but from those who thought it too\nfew. Uvedale Price, following suggestions in the writings of William\nGilpin, argued that there are objects\u2014landscapes,\nparadigmatically\u2014which please the eye, but which can be\nconsidered neither beautiful nor sublime. These objects cannot be\nconsidered sublime because they need not be grand (Price 1796,\n106\u2013107); they cannot be considered beautiful because they are\nnot smooth, their pleasure depending on \u201csudden protuberance,\nand lines that cross each other in a sudden and broken manner\u201d\n(Price 1796, 61\u201362). Because the play of form, color, light, and\nshadow afforded by such objects renders them ideal subjects for\npainting and drawing, Gilpin referred to them as\n\u201cpicturesque\u201d (Gilpin 1794, 3\u20135). By the end of the\ncentury, the picturesque came to be regarded widely as occupying the\nposition vacated by the novel, i.e., that of a third perfection of\ntaste.\n",
