    "main_text": "Political and Social Philosophy\n11. Philosophy of Religion\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s most radical and important work in the\nphilosophy of religion is On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured\nDespisers from 1799. (Later editions of this work, and his later\ntheological treatise The Christian Faith, strive for greater\nChristian orthodoxy, and are consequently as a rule less interesting\nfrom a philosophical point of view.)\n\nAs its title implies, the project of On Religion is to save\nreligion from the contempt of enlightenment and especially romantic\nskeptics about religion, \u201cits cultured despisers\u201d. At\nleast where the romantics were concerned, the work was strikingly\nsuccessful in this regard, in that several of them, especially\nFriedrich Schlegel, did turn to religion following the book\u2019s\npublication (though admittedly not to quite the sort of religion that\nSchleiermacher had envisaged). Schleiermacher\u2019s later philosophy\nof religion has a similar motivation. In his 1829 open letters to\nL\u00fccke he especially emphasizes the pressing need to defend\nreligion against the twin threats posed to it by modern natural\nscience and modern historical-philological scholarship.\n\nThis project of defending religion against educated skeptics is\nreminiscent of Kant\u2019s similarly motivated critical philosophy.\nSchleiermacher is also sympathetic to Kant\u2019s general strategy in\nconnection with religious matters of \u201cdeny[ing] knowledge in\norder to make room for faith\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason,\nBxxx), and in particular to Kant\u2019s attack on the traditional\nproofs of the existence of God; Schleiermacher himself denies that\nreligion is a form of knowledge or can be based on metaphysics or\nscience. However, as can already be seen from his early unpublished\nessays On the Highest Good (1789) and On What Gives Value\nto Life (1792\u20133), Schleiermacher\u2019s approach is in\nother respects defined more by opposition to than by agreement with\nKant\u2019s. In particular, Schleiermacher sharply rejects\nKant\u2019s alternative moral proof of an otherworldly God\nand human immortality (i.e., Kant\u2019s proof of these by showing\nthem to be necessary presuppositions of morality); for Schleiermacher\nreligion can no more be based on morality than on metaphysics or\nscience.\n\nAs this stance already suggests, Schleiermacher has considerable\nsympathy with the skeptics about religion whom he means to answer.\nBut, at least in his early period, his sympathy with them also goes\nmuch deeper than that. In On Religion he is skeptical about\nthe ideas of God and human immortality altogether, arguing that the\nformer is merely optional (to be included in one\u2019s religion or\nnot depending on the nature of one\u2019s imagination), and that the\nlatter is downright unacceptable. Moreover, he diagnoses the modern\nprevalence of such religious ideas in terms of the deadening influence\nthat is exerted by modern bourgeois society and state-interference on\nreligion. He reconciles this rather startling concession to the\nskeptics with his ultimate goal of defending religion by claiming that\nsuch ideas are inessential to religion. This position strikingly\nanticipates such later radical religious positions as Fritz\nMauthner\u2019s \u201cgodless mysticism\u201d.\n(Schleiermacher\u2019s own later religious thought tended to\nbacktrack on this radicalism, however, restoring God and even human\nimmortality to a central place in religion.)\n\nThis naturally leaves one wondering what the content and the\nepistemological basis of religion are for the early\nSchleiermacher. As can already be seen from the 1793\u20134 essays\nSpinozism and Brief Presentation of the Spinozistic\nSystem, and then again from On Religion, he follows\nSpinoza in believing in a monistic principle that encompasses\neverything, a \u201cone and all\u201d. However, he also modifies\nSpinoza\u2019s conception in certain ways\u2014partly under the\ninfluence of Herder (whom he mentions by name in the essays on\nSpinoza). In particular, whereas Spinoza had conceived his monistic\nprinciple as a substance, Schleiermacher follows Herder in thinking of\nit rather as an original force and as the unifying source of a\nmultiplicity of more mundane forces. (Later on Schleiermacher\ndistanced himself from this neo-Spinozistic position. Indeed, he\nexplicitly denied that he was a follower of Spinoza. Accordingly, in\nthe dialectics lectures he argued that there was an even higher\n\u201ctranscendental ground\u201d beyond the Spinozist\nnatura naturans or the Herderian highest force. His main\nmotive behind this change of position seems to have been a desire to\navoid the heavily charged accusations of Spinozism and\npantheism\u2014which is not an impressive motive philosophically\nspeaking.)\n\nSo much for the early Schleiermacher\u2019s conception of the content\nof religion. What about its epistemological basis? As was mentioned,\nfor Schleiermacher religion is founded neither on theoretical\nknowledge nor on morality. According to On Religion, it is\ninstead based on an intuition or feeling of the universe:\n\u201cReligion\u2019s essence is neither thinking nor acting, but\nintuition and feeling. It wishes to intuit the universe\u201d\n(OR Second Speech: 22).\n\nThe term \u201cintuition\u201d here is both revealing and\nproblematic. As Kant had defined it, \u201cintuition is that\nthrough which [a mode of knowledge] is in immediate relation to\n[objects]\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason, A19). So part of\nwhat Schleiermacher means to convey here is evidently some sort of\nimmediate cognitive relation to some sort of object, namely, the\nuniverse as a single whole. On the other hand, the term\n\u201cintuition\u201d also imported certain implications that\nSchleiermacher in fact wanted to avoid. In particular, Kantian\nintuition, whether pure or empirical, required the addition of\nconcepts in order to constitute any sort of real insight\n(\u201cintuitions without concepts are\nblind\u201d\u2014Critique of Pure Reason, A51), whereas\nSchleiermacher had in mind a sort of insight that is unmediated by\nconcepts. In the later editions of On Religion he therefore\nretreated from speaking of \u201cintuition\u201d in connection with\nreligion (instead reserving this term for science), and instead spoke\nsimply of \u201cfeeling\u201d. In accordance with this change,\nThe Christian Faith went on to define religion more\nspecifically as a feeling of absolute dependence, or what\nSchleiermacher also described in his open letters to L\u00fccke as the\nimmediate consciousness of \u201can immediate\nexistence-relationship\u201d.\n\nA further aspect of the \u201cfeeling\u201d on which Schleiermacher\nbases religion should also be mentioned: its inclusion of\nmotivating force, its self-manifestation in actions.\nThe wish to include this aspect was one of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nreasons for supplementing religious \u201cintuition\u201d with\n\u201cfeeling\u201d even in the first edition of On\nReligion. And his later work emphasizes this dimension of\nreligious \u201cfeeling\u201d as well.\n\nThis whole epistemological position looks suspiciously like\nphilosophical sleight-of-hand, however. \u201cFeelings\u201d can be\nof at least two very different sorts: on the one hand, non-cognitive\n\u201cfeelings\u201d, such as physical pains and pleasures; on the\nother hand, \u201cfeelings\u201d that incorporate beliefs, for\nexample, a feeling that such and such is the case. Whereas the\npossession and awareness of non-cognitive feelings such as pains and\npleasures may indeed be conceptually unmediated, beyond the reach of\nreasons for or against, and hence in a sense infallible, the\npossession and awareness of feelings that incorporate beliefs, for\ninstance, the feeling that such and such is the case, does require\nconceptual mediation, is subject to reasoning for or against, and is\nfallible. As can be seen from the neo-Spinozistic content that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s religious intuition or feeling was originally\nsupposed to have, his original characterization of it as an intuition\nin the Kantian sense of an immediate cognitive relation to an object,\nhis later characterization of it as representing \u201can immediate\nexistence-relationship\u201d, and so on, he does not mean religious\nfeeling to be merely non-cognitive, but rather to incorporate some\nsort of belief. However, he also helps himself to the apparent\nepistemological advantages that belong only to non-cognitive feelings:\nnon-mediation by concepts, transcendence of reasons for or against,\nand infallibility. In short, it looks as though his epistemological\ngrounding of religion in \u201cfeeling\u201d depends on a systematic\nconfusion of these two crucially different sorts of cases.\n\nTurning more briefly to some additional features of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of religion in On Religion:\nHe recognizes the validity of a potentially endless multiplicity of\nforms of religion there, and strongly advocates religious toleration.\nHowever, he also arranges the various types of religion in a\nhierarchy, with animism at the bottom, polytheism in the middle, and\nmonotheism or otherwise monistic religions at the top. This hierarchy\nis understandable given his fundamental neo-Spinozism.\n\nMore internally problematic, though, is a further elaboration of this\nhierarchy that he introduces: he identifies Christianity as the\nhighest among the monotheistic or monistic religions, and in\nparticular as higher than Judaism. His rationale for this is that\nChristianity introduces \u201cthe idea that everything finite\nrequires higher mediation in order to be connected with the\ndivine\u201d (i.e., the higher mediation of Christ)\n(OR Fifth Speech: 120). However, this looks\ncontrived. For one thing, it is left unclear why \u201chigher\nmediation\u201d is supposed to be a good thing. Moreover, even if one\nwere to grant that it is, why do other monotheistic religions such as\nJudaism not share in this putative advantage as well, namely, in the\nform of their prophets? And if the answer is that this is because\nprophets are not themselves divine, then why is the mediator\u2019s\ndivinity supposed to be such a great advantage?\n\nIn addition, Schleiermacher remarks insightfully on the distinctively\npolemical nature of Christianity, the striking extent to\nwhich Christianity\u2019s religious and moral standpoint is defined\nby a hostile opposition to other standpoints, and even to dissenting\npositions within Christianity itself. This observation recalls that of\nanother well-informed and honest Christian, Montaigne, who had noted\nin his Apology for Raymond Sebond (1580) that \u201cthere is\nno hostility quite as perfect as Christian hostility\u201d. And it is\namply borne out by the historical evidence\u2014for example, the\nbloody early history of Christianity, the Crusades, the\nInquisition\u2019s treatment of Jews and witches, the Wars of\nReligion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many\nother, similar horrors (all of which only stopped, or at least\ndiminished, when Christianity was rendered politically impotent by the\nEnlightenment and the American and French Revolutions in the\neighteenth century). Moreover, this striking feature of Christianity\nhas since received deeper explanations\u2014including Jan\nAssman\u2019s observation that unlike most other religions\nJudeo-Christian-Muslim religion was from the start a sort of\n\u201canti-religion [Gegenreligion]\u201d, defined by its\nopposition to other religions and cultures, and Nietzsche\u2019s\nobservation that Christianity and its morality in particular were from\nthe beginning a reaction against Greek and Roman culture motivated by\nresentment against Greek and Roman imperial oppression in Palestine\nand elsewhere, so that, for example, the Greeks\u2019 most general\nword for a god, daim\u00f4n, became the Christian concept of\na demon, and Christian moral values performed a systematic\ninversion of traditional Greek and Roman values. So\nSchleiermacher\u2019s observation is an insightful one. But then how\ncan a proponent of religious pluralism and toleration like\nSchleiermacher consistently see this striking trait of Christianity as\nanything but a serious vice?\n\nOn the (flimsy) basis of his perception of Christianity\u2019s\nsuperiority as a religion, Schleiermacher also tries to reconcile his\nneo-Spinozism with traditional Christian doctrines as far as possible.\nThis project already begins in a modest way in On Religion,\nwhere, for example, he tries to salvage the Christian doctrine of\nmiracles in the modified form of a doctrine that classifies\nall events as miracles (insofar as viewed from a religious\nperspective). A similar project is pursued more elaborately (and\ntediously) in The Christian Faith.\n\nFinally, a more fruitful contribution of Schleiermacher\u2019s to the\nstudy of Christianity was the series of lectures on the life of Jesus\nthat\u2014under the influence of two late works of Herder\u2019s:\nOn the Savior of Mankind according to our First Three Gospels\n(1796) and On God\u2019s Son, the World\u2019s Savior, according\nto John\u2019s Gospel (1797)\u2014he began to deliver in 1819\nand which were published posthumously as The Life of Jesus.\nSchleiermacher tried in these lectures to combine an interpretation of\nJesus as a mere human being with a claim that his extraordinary level\nof awareness of God nonetheless amounted to a sort of presence of God\nin him. This compromise was strained and implausible. But\nSchleiermacher\u2019s project nonetheless constituted an important\nfirst step toward much more consistently naturalistic and plausible\ntreatments of the life of Jesus by subsequent scholars, especially\nDavid Friedrich Strauss\u2019s The Life of Jesus, Critically\nExamined (1835\u20136).\nGuide to the Literature\nLife and Works\n\nArndt 2013; Berner 1995; Dilthey [1870] 1966\u20131970; Haym [1870]\n1920 (ch. 3); Mari\u00f1a 2005; Redeker 1973; Scholtz 1984.\nPhilosophy of Language\n\nCoseriu 2015 (vol. 2, ch. 8) (a detailed, helpful treatment); Forster\n2011b, 2014; Gipper and Schmitter 1985 (92\u201398) (an excellent\nbook on this as well as other subjects).\nPhilosophy of Mind\n\nCoseriu 2015 (vol. 2, ch. 8) (Coseriu pays close attention to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s lectures on psychology); Sigwart 1857.\nHermeneutics (i.e., Theory of Interpretation)\n\nArndt 2013; Berner 1995; Boeckh 1877; Bowie 1997; Dilthey 1860, 1900;\nForster 2010b, 2011c; Frank 1985, 1990 (these two books, especially\nthe former of them, are arguably the most important secondary\nliterature on Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics available); Gadamer\n[1960] 2002 (part 2) (a decidedly hostile but nonetheless important\ntreatment of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics); Hirsch 1967 (a\nsignificant Anglophone appropriation of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics); Kimmerle 1957 (an important and influential\ncontribution that counteracts Dilthey\u2019s overemphasis of the\npsychological, as opposed to linguistic, side of interpretation in\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics); Palmer 1969 (ch. 7) (helpful on\nSchleiermacher as well as on other figures); Patsch 1966 (a learned\nand important article that discusses Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics in relation to Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s); Ricoeur 1973,\n1977 (helpful though dull); Szondi [1970] 1986 (like most of\nSzondi\u2019s writings, thoughtful and helpful); Wach 1926\u20131933\n(learned and informative, though not exciting).
