    "main_text": "Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology || Metaphor\n4.3 Metaphor\n\n\nThere is significant feminist work on the role of gender-laden\nlanguage, and in particular of metaphor, in biology. Evelyn Fox\nKeller has done significant work on \u201cMaster Molecule\u201d\ncharacterizations of DNA (1983, 1985). She has also argued that\ncultural norms enter into evolutionary biology, particularly\nmathematical ecology, due to a slippage between technical and\ncolloquial uses of the word \u201ccompetition,\u201d and that the\nlanguage of reproductive autonomy supports a bias towards individualism\nin biology (Keller 1992b). Emily Martin (1991) and the\nBiology and Gender Study Group (1988) both have shown that romantic\nmetaphors play a confounding role in biological descriptions of\nfertilization. In some cases, supporting false assumptions of\nfemale passivity, the egg is cast in the role of Sleeping Beauty that\nis awakened by the valiant sperm, which struggled to beat out its\nrivals and awaken the egg. In stories that acknowledge the\nactivity of the egg, it is cast in the role of femme fatale, snagging\nthe hapless sperm and dragging it into its clutches. Both sets of\nstories cohere with female stereotypes and neither of them clearly\ndescribes the reciprocal interactions between the egg and the sperm\nduring reproduction. \n",
