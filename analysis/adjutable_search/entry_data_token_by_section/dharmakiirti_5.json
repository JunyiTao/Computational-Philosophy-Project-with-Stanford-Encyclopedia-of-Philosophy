    "main_text": "Epistemology and philosophy of language || Pram\u0101\u1e47as and justification\n2.1 Pram\u0101\u1e47as and justification\n\nDign\u0101ga had left the problem of the nature of\npram\u0101\u1e47as largely open, as he did with the issue of\njustification. These matters were left to Dharmak\u012brti, who\ndefines a \u201csource of knowledge\u201d in\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika II.1 as a \u201creliable\n(avisa\u1e43v\u0101din) cognition\n(j\u00f1\u0101na),\u201d by which he means that the\ncognition is right and reliable as a basis for\n action.[29]\n Some commentators, such as Dharmottara, have unpacked\n\u201creliability\u201d as meaning that the cognition leads to one\nobtaining (pr\u0101paka) the object one desires, a position\nwhich, along with passages concerning arthakriy\u0101, might\nseem to reinforce the view of some modern scholars that\nDharmak\u012brti was a pragmatist (see e.g., Powers 1994; Cabezon\n2000; Katsura 1984).\n [30]\n Tillemans (1999, 6\u201312) examines this would-be pragmatism,\nseeing the theory of truth in Dharmak\u012brti as a weak form of\ncorrespondence. The pragmatism is better taken as a pragmatic theory\nof justification rather than truth. We can justifiably affirm that a\ncognition is correct if we can \u201cconfirm causal efficacy\u201d\n(arthakriy\u0101sthiti), by which it is meant that we come to\nunderstand that the object does in fact have the causal powers we\nexpected. We can justifiably conclude, for example, that we saw a vase\nand not some vase-like illusion because after the initial perception\nwe then confirmed that what we saw does really hold water, as we\nexpected and wished (i\u1e63\u1e6da). Note that while most\nsense perceptions are to be confirmed by subsequent perceptions or\ninferences, there is no infinite regress here: some\nperceptions\u2014e.g., those of very familiar objects or of the\ncapacity of such objects to produce effects\u2014need no subsequent\nconfirmation. Logical inference too needs no ulterior confirmation.\nThese are said to be \u201cintrinsically sources of knowledge\u201d\n(svata\u1e25 pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) and are prima\nfacie reliable in that they will be trusted as knowledge unless\nit is shown that some cause of error is\n present.[31]\n\nIt is important to emphasize, against a simplistic pragmatic\ninterpretation of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s position, that a reliable\ncognition is not one that just happens to be right and works\nto enable one to obtain what one seeks. It must also be a cognition\nthat came about via a reliable route, i.e., an appropriate causal\npathway or a set of good reasons. Tibetan scholars will emphasize that\nto conceptually know P the knower must herself ascertain\nP (Tib. nges pa = Skt. ni\u015bcaya,\nni\u015bcita) with a pram\u0101\u1e47a, and that this\nascertainment must itself involve antecedent reliable cognitions\n(i.e., perceptual or conceptual pram\u0101\u1e47as) in order\nto be genuine. Thus, for example, one ascertains P\non the basis of good reasons Q, R, etc., whose\ncharacteristics one has ascertained earlier. If, however, one rightly\nthinks P is the case, but did \u201cnot [first] ascertain\nwith a pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d (tshad mas ma nges\npa) the characteristics of Q, R, this is deemed\nto be, in Geluk (dge lugs) texts, a \u201ctrue presumption\nwhere the [character of the] reason was not determined\u201d (Tib.\nrgyu mtshan gtan la ma phab pa\u2019i yid dpyod), or following the\nSakya (sa skya) thinkers, a mere \u201cdoubt that is in\naccord with the real\u201d (Tib. the tshom don mthun). For\nboth these Tibetan schools, such an understanding of P is not\nitself a pram\u0101\u1e47a. This is a credible account of\nwhat Dharmak\u012brti held. In short, pram\u0101\u1e47as do\nwork out as we wish, but only because they are cognitions that have\nfollowed the requisite reliable route.\n\nBut does this talk of ascertainment then mean that the Buddhist\nEpistemologist adopts an internalist account of epistemic\njustification? Is the Buddhist saying that when you genuinely know\nsomething, you need to know that you know it, i.e., be able to\nestablish to yourself and others that you have the requisite\njustification?\n [32]\n It is not at all clear that Dharmak\u012brti or his Tibetan\ninterpreters were internalists about epistemic justification. Nothing\nin his own talk of \u201cascertainment\u201d clinches an internalist\ninterpretation that the person who infers must also himself access the\nreason and ascertain with a pram\u0101\u1e47a that it does\njustify the inference. When the debater ascertains the characteristics\nof the reason, all this may mean is that a person making an inference\nmust only in fact have followed a number of reliable\nprocedures to initially determine the characteristics of the reason.\nIt need not mean that when one knows something inferentially one must\nalso be aware of the justification basis, i.e., the reason, and know\nthat it does indeed justify the inference.\n\nIt might be retorted that Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s idea of all awareness\nbeing \u201creflexive awareness\u201d (svasa\u1e43vedana)\nshows his internalism. But \u201creflexive\nawareness\u201d\u2014often termed \u201cself-awareness\u201d (even\nthough for Buddhists it is emphatically not an awareness of a\nself and its states)\u2014will not get us all the way to internalism\nabout justification either. Following Williams (1998), Kellner (2010)\nand Arnold (2010), there seem to be to be two basic themes in the\npositions from Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita that all consciousness is\nnon-conceptually reflexive: (1) that the mind perceives such and\nsuch objects as well as how it experiences those objects; it is thus\nnon-conceptually aware of the objective and subjective aspects\n(\u0101k\u0101ra), or appearances\n(\u0101bh\u0101sa), of all its states; (2) that reflexive\nawareness is a condition of sentience: an experience is not just a\nmaterial process (like, say, digestion), but can lead to subsequent\nmemory and conceptualization because it is non-conceptually\n \u201cauto-illuminated.\u201d[33]\n On both versions, however, while someone could be aware that she is\nnow inferring P in reliance upon a reason Q, it is\nhard to see that her simple awareness of processes \u201cgoing on in\nher head\u201d would also mean that she herself would know that or\nwhy the inference was justified. Reflexive awareness is aware of\nwhatever conscious processes are occurring, be they delusions\nor reliable. So, while a person would be aware of the brute fact that\nthoughts were occurring, their credentials are another matter.\n",
