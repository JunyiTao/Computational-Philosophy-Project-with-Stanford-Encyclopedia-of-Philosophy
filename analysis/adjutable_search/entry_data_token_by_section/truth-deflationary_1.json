    "main_text": "Central Themes in Deflationism || The Property of Truth\n1.2 The Property of Truth\n\nThe second theme we will discuss focuses on the fact that when we say,\nfor example, that the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true,\nwe seem to be attributing a property to that proposition, namely, the\nproperty of being true. Deflationists are typically wary of that\nclaim, insisting either that there is no property of being true at\nall, or, if there is one, it is of a certain kind, often called\n\u201cthin\u201d or \u201cinsubstantial\u201d.\n\nThe suggestion that there is no truth property at all is advanced by\nsome philosophers in the deflationary camp; we will look at some\nexamples below. What makes this position difficult to sustain is that\n\u2018is true\u2019 is grammatically speaking a predicate much like\n\u2018is metal\u2019. If one assumes that grammatical predicates\nsuch as \u2018is metal\u2019 express properties, then, prima\nfacie, the same would seem to go for \u2018is true.\u2019 This\npoint is not decisive, however. For one thing, it might be possible to\ndistinguish the grammatical form of claims containing \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 from their logical form; at the level of logical form, it\nmight be, as prosententialists maintain, that \u2018is true\u2019 is\nnot a predicate. For another, nominalists about properties\nhave developed ways of thinking about grammatical predicates according\nto which these expressions don\u2019t express properties at all. A\ndeflationist might appeal, perhaps selectively, to such proposals, in\norder to say that \u2018is true\u2019, while a predicate, does not\nexpress a property.\n\nWhatever the ultimate fate of these attempts to say that there is no\nproperty of truth may be, a suggestion among certain deflationists has\nbeen to concede that there is a truth property but to deny it is a\nproperty of a certain kind; in particular to deny that it is (as we\nwill say) a substantive property.\n\nTo illustrate the general idea, consider (3) and (4):\n\n(3)\nCaracas is the capital of Venezuela.\n\n\n(4)\nThe earth revolves around the sun.\n\n\nDo the propositions that these sentences express share a property of\nbeing true? Well, in one intuitive sense they do: Since they both are\ntrue, we might infer that they both have the property of being true.\nFrom this point of view, there is a truth property: It is simply the\nproperty that all true propositions have.\n\nOn the other hand, when we say that two things share a property of\nFness, we often mean more than simply that they are both\n\\(F\\). We often mean that two things that are \\(F\\) have some\nunderlying nature in common, for example, that there is a common\nexplanation as to why they are both \\(F\\). It is in this second claim\nthat deflationists have in mind when they say that truth is not a\nsubstantive property. Thus, in the case of our example, what, if\nanything, explains the truth of (3) is that Caracas is the capital of\nVenezuela, and what explains this is the political history of\nVenezuela. On the other hand, what, if anything, explains the truth of\n(4) is that the earth revolves around the sun, and what explains this\nis the physical nature of the solar system. The physical nature of the\nsolar system, however, has nothing to do with the political history of\nVenezuela (or if it does, the connections are completely accidental!)\nand to that extent there is no shared explanation as to why (3) and\n(4) are both true. Therefore, in this substantive sense, they have no\nproperty in common.\n\nIt will help to bring out the contrast being invoked here if we\nconsider two properties distinct from a supposed property of being\ntrue: the property of being a game and the property of being a mammal.\nConsider the games of chess and catch. Do both of these have the\nproperty of being a game? Well, in one sense, they do: they are both\ngames that people can play. On the other hand, however, there is no\ncommon explanation as to why each counts as a game (cf. Wittgenstein\n1953, \u00a766). We might then say that being a game is not a\nsubstantive property and mean just this. But now compare the property\nof being a mammal. If two things are mammals, they have the property\nof being a mammal, but in addition there is some common explanation as\nto why they are both mammals \u2013 both are descended from the same\nfamily of creatures, say. According to one development of\ndeflationism, the property of being true is more like the property of\nbeing a game than it is like the property of being a mammal.\n\nThe comparisons between being true, being a game, and being a mammal\nare suggestive, but they still do not nail down exactly what it means\nto say that truth is not a substantive property. The contemporary\nliterature on deflationism contains several different approaches to\nthe idea. One such approach, which we will consider in detail in\nSection 4.1, involves denying that truth plays an explanatory role.\nAnother approach, pursuing an analogy between being true and existing,\ndescribes truth as a \u201clogical property\u201d (for example,\nField 1992, 322; Horwich 1998a, 37; K\u00fcnne 2003, 91). A further\napproach appeals to\n David Lewis\u2019s\n (1983, 1986) view that, while every set of entities underwrites a\nproperty, there is a distinction between sparse, or\nnatural, properties and more motley or disjointed\nabundant properties. On this approach, a deflationist might\nsay that there is an abundant property of being true rather than a\nsparse one (cf. Edwards 2013, Asay 2014, Kukla and Winsberg 2015, and\nArmour-Garb forthcoming). A different metaphysical idea may be to\nappeal to the contemporary discussion of grounding and the distinction\nbetween groundable and ungroundable properties. In this context, a\ngroundable property is one that is capable of being grounded in some\nother property, whether or not it is in fact grounded; an ungroundable\nproperty is a property that is not groundable (see Dasgupta 2015, 2016\nand Rabin 2020). From this point of view, a deflationist might say\nthat being true is an ungroundable property. Hence it is unlike\nordinary, sparse/natural properties, such as being iron, which are\nboth capable of being grounded and are grounded, and it is also unlike\nfundamental physical properties, such as being a lepton, which are\ncapable of being grounded (in some other possible world) but are not\n(actually) grounded. We will not try to decide here which of these\ndifferent views of properties is correct but simply note that\ndeflationists who want to claim that there is a truth property, just\nnot a substantive one, have options for explaining what this\nmeans.\n",
