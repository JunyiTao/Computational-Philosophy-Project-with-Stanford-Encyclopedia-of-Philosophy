Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained?\n\nNon-cognitivist success in handling the embedding problem and related\nworries about reasoning would put non-cognitivists in a stronger\nargumentative position. But some commentators have suggested that\nsuccess at this endeavor might be a mixed blessing. Success may\nindicate not that non-cognitivism is the right account of moral\njudgments, but instead that the contrast with cognitivism is not stark\nenough to make out a real distinction. Perhaps the distinction between\ncognitivism and non-cognitivism collapses as non-cognitivist theories\nare modified to capture all of the phenomena that cognitivists\nchallenge them to explain. While both its advocates and those who\nargued strenuously against it would likely find themselves somewhat\ndisoriented if this were correct, it does seem that non-cognitivists\nwould be most upset by this result. For their position was defined by\ndenying key components of standard realist positions. If the\ncognitivist/non-cognitivist dichotomy does not hold up, it would seem\nto show either that the standard positions were not after all\ncommitted to those components, or that those commitments could not be\navoided by plausible theories.\n\nEarly versions of non-cognitivism did not seem subject to this sort of\nobjection, precisely because they did not worry much about vindicating\noverall moral practice. Carnap (1937, 30\u201331) was happy to\nconvict ordinary moral thinking of error. But as non-cognitivists have\nattempted to make sense of and explain most of the seemingly realist\nfeatures of moral practice, it might seem hard to sustain the claim of\na sharp contrast between factual language on the one hand and\nnormative language on the other. Several challenges based on roughly\nthis idea find a home in the recent literature.\n",
