    "main_text": "Giles of Rome\n10. Giles of Rome\n\nPhilip IV, King of France (1285\u20131314), was one of the most\nruthless of medieval rulers. He came into conflict with Pope Boniface\nVIII (1294\u20131303), one of the most arrogant of medieval popes,\nand with Pope Clement V (1305\u20131314), one of the most timid.\nClement acquiesced in Philip\u2019s attack on the Templar Order and\nother outrages to evade the king\u2019s pressure to condemn his\npredecessor, Boniface, as a heretic. These conflicts gave rise to a\nbody of writings of great interest to the history of political\n thought.[53]\n Of these the most important were Giles of Rome\u2019s De\necclesiastica potestate (On Ecclesiastical\n Power)[54]\n and John of Paris\u2019s De potestate regia et papali\n(On Royal and Papal Power), both c.\n 1302,[55]\n respectively an assertion of supreme papal power and an attempt to\nrestate the dualism of Duo sunt (see\n \u00a76\n and\n note 29).\n\nGiles argues that the pope\u2019s fullness of power extends to\npolitical matters, so that the pope is the supreme ruler of the world,\nGod\u2019s deputy on earth, who delegates power to governments and\nsupervises their activities. Giles\u2019s term for governmental power\nis dominium, which was also a term for property; Giles\nassimilates the two kinds of dominium, so that he holds that\nthe pope is also the supreme owner. He supports his position with many\narguments, of which the following two are perhaps most significant.\n(1) He appeals to the idea that the universe is a single unity with a\nhierarchical ordering in which the pope is the supreme hierarch among\nmankind: there are two swords, but the temporal sword must be subject\nto the spiritual, i.e., secular rulers must be subject to the\n pope.[56]\n (2) He applies Augustine\u2019s discussion of the question whether\nthe Romans had a true republic (see\n \u00a74.1)\n to argue that no one who does not submit to Christ\u2019s\ndominium, and therefore to the dominium of the pope\nas Christ\u2019s vicar, can have any just dominium himself.\nAs Augustine said, property is possessed by the laws of emperors and\nkings\n (\u00a74.3),\n which presupposes the authority of a community: so, Giles argues,\nsince people who fail to honour the true God cannot belong to a\ncommunity, only members of the community of the faithful can have any\nright to political power or\n property.[57]\nJohn Wyclif (c. 1330\u201384) later took these arguments further to\nthe conclusion that no sinner, indeed only the predestined, can have\nany just dominium, a doctrine condemned by the Council of\nConstance. The thesis that only Christians can have lordship was\ninconsistent with the theological tradition and was generally\n rejected.[58]\n\n\nGiles of Rome may have had a hand in drafting Boniface\u2019s\ndocument Unam sanctam (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n generally regarded as the most extreme statement of papal authority.\nWhether he drafted it or not, the ideas and language of Unam\nsanctam are reminiscent of Giles\u2019s work (see Ubl 2004).\n",
