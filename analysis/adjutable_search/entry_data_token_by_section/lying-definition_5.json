    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Lying || Objections to the Traditional Definition of Lying\n1.5 Objections to the Traditional Definition of Lying\n\n\nTwo kinds of objections have been made to L1. First, objections have\nbeen made to each necessary condition, on the basis that it is not\nnecessary for lying. According to these objections, L1 is too\nnarrow. Second, objections have been made to the four necessary\nconditions being jointly sufficient for lying, on the basis that some\nfurther condition is necessary for lying.  According to these\nobjections, L1 is too broad.\n1.5.1 Conditions Are Not Necessary\n\n\nAgainst the statement condition of L1 it has been objected that the\nmaking of a statement is not necessary for lying. Lying to others may\nbe defined as \u201cany form of behavior the function of\nwhich is to provide others with false information or to deprive them of\ntrue information\u201d (Smith 2004, 14), or as \u201ca successful\nor unsuccessful deliberate attempt, without forewarning, to create in\nanother a belief which the communicator considers to be\nuntrue\u201d (Vrij 2000, 6). Importantly, this entails that lying can\nconsist of simply withholding information with the intent to deceive,\nwithout making any statement at all (Ekman 1985, 28; Scott 2006, 4).\nThose who make this objection would make lying the same as\nintentionally deceiving (Ekman 1985, 26).\n\n\nAgainst the untruthfulness condition of L1 it has been objected that\nan untruthful statement is not necessary for lying. This objection\ncomes in a variety of forms. There are those who argue any statement\nmade with an intention to deceive is a lie, including a truthful\nstatement that is made with an intention to deceive (Barnes 1994, 11;\nDavidson 1980, 88). Lying may thus be defined as \u201cany\nintentionally deceptive message that is stated\u201d (Bok\n1978, 13). There are also those who, relying upon a Gricean account of\nconversational implicature (Grice 1989, 39)), argue that someone who\nmakes a truthful statement but who thereby conversationally implicates\na believed-false statement is lying (Meibauer 2011, 285;\n2014a). Importantly, such an \u201cuntruthful implicature\u201d\n(Dynel 2011, 159\u2013160) is \u201cdirectly intended\u201d (Adler\n1997, 446). Thirdly, there are those who argue for the possibility of\n\u201clying ironically\u201d (Simpson 1992, 631), or indirect lying.\nIf a speaker makes an ironic untruthful statement, then \u201cThrough\nthis presentation of himself as insincerely asserting he presents\nhimself as believing\u201d the opposite of what he says, which is\n\u201ccapacity to\u2026 assert in-effect\u201d (Simpson 1992,\n630).  If the person is \u201cinsincere in this\u201d and actually\ndoes believe in the truth of what he states, despite invoking trust in\nhis believing its opposite, then \u201cthis is a lie (an indirect\nlie, we might say)\u201d (Simpson 1992, 630). For example, if a\nperson who is listening to a sappy pop song at a party is asked if she\nlikes this kind of music and replies, ironically, \u201cYeah, right,\nI love this kind of music,\u201d then she is lying if she actually\ndoes love this kind of music (cf. Dynel 2011,\n148\u2013149).\n\n\nAgainst the untruthfulness condition it has also been objected that\nit is not necessary for lying that the statement that is made is\nbelieved to be false; it is sufficient that the statement is not\nbelieved to be true, or is believed to be probably false\n(Carson 2006, 298; 2010, 18). As it has been claimed, \u201cAgnostics\nabout the truth of their assertions who nonetheless assert them without\nqualification tell lies\u201d (Shiffrin 2014, 13).\n\n\nAgainst the addressee condition of L1 it has been objected that it is\nsufficient for lying that the untruthful statement is made, even if it\nis made to no one \u2014 not even to oneself (Griffiths 2004,\n31). Lying may thus be defined as \u201cconscious expression of other\nthan what we believe\u201d (Shibles 1985, 33). It has also been\nobjected that it is possible to lie to third parties who are not\naddressees. In general, it is possible to distinguish between cases\nwhere \u201cthe hearer eavesdrops, unbeknown to the first\nand second parties\u201d (eavesdropping), cases where\n\u201cthe speaker utters p to the interlocutor while the\nhearer, with the awareness of both other parties, listens in and knows\nthat the first- and second-party know he is listening in\u2026\nalthough it is for the interlocutor that the utterance is\nintended\u201d (kibbitzing), as well as cases similar to\nkibbitzing except that \u201cthe utterance is also intended for the\nhearer [who knows that they know that he is listening in]\u201d\n(disclosure), and cases similar to disclosure \u201cexcept\nthat although the first and second parties know that the hearer is\nlistening in, the hearer does not know that they are listening\nin\u201d (bogus disclosure) (Newey 1997, 115). Even if it is\nnot possible to lie to eavesdroppers, or to those merely listening in,\nas in the case of kibbitzing, it may be possible to lie in the cases\nof bogus disclosure, as in the example above of Mickey saying to\nDanny, \u201cThe pick-up is at midnight tomorrow,\u201d with the\nintention of deceiving the F.B.I. agents listening in. It may even be\npossible to lie in the case of disclosure. In the 1978 thriller\nCapricorn One about a Mars landing hoax, during a nationally\ntelevised transmission between the astronauts \u2018in space\u2019\nand their wives at the control center, which is being monitored\nclosely by NASA handlers, Colonel Charles Brubaker tells his wife Kay\nto tell his son that \u201cWhen I get back, I\u2019m gonna take him\nto Yosemite again, like last summer.\u201d In fact he brought his son\nto a different place the previous summer (Flatbush, where a movie was\nbeing shot), something that his wife knows. According to this\nobjection, Brubaker is lying to his NASA handlers about\nwhat he did last summer, even if they are not his addressees.\n\n\nAgainst the addressee condition it has also been objected that it\nis possible to lie to an animal, a robot, etc., as well as to\nwhat might be another person\u2014for example, if a home\nowner, woken up in the middle of the night and wondering if there are\nburglars below the stairs, shouts down, \u201cI\u2019m bringing my rifle\ndown there,\u201d although he has no rifle (Chisholm and Feehan 1977,\n157).\n\n\nAgainst the intention to deceive the addressee condition of L1 it\nhas been objected that, even if an intention to deceive the addressee\nis required for lying, it is not necessary that it be an intention to\ndeceive the addressee about the content of the untruthful\nstatement; it may be an intention to deceive the addressee about the\nbeliefs of the speaker abut the statement\u2014specifically,\nthe belief that the untruthful statement is true (Chisholm and Feehan\n1977, 152; Williams 2002, 74; Reboul 1994, 294; Mahon 2008, 220;\nTollefsen 2014, 24). \nThere are at least two ways in which L1 could be modified in\nresponse to this objection. First, it could be held that what is\nessential to lying is the intention to deceive the hearer about the\nspeaker\u2019s belief that the untruthful statement is true:\n\u201cx utters a sentence, \u2018S,\u2019 where\n\u2018S\u2019 means that p, in doing which\neither x expresses his belief that p, or x\nintends the person addressed to take it that x believes\nthat p\u201d (Williams 2002, 74) and \u201cthe speaker\nbelieves [p] to be false\u201d (Williams 2002,\n96\u201397). L1 could therefore be modified as follows:\n\n(L2)\nTo lie =df to make a statement that p,\nwhere p is believed to be false, to another person, with the\nintention that the other person believe that p is believed to\nbe true. (cf. Williams 2002, 74, 96\u201397)\n\n\n\nAlternatively, L1 could be modified to incorporate either intention,\nas follows:\n\n(L3)\nTo lie =df to make a believed-false statement\n(to another person), either with the intention that that statement be\nbelieved to be true (by the other person), or with the intention that\nit be believed (by the other person) that that statement is believed to\nbe true (by the person making the statement), or with both\nintentions. (Mahon 2008, 227\u2013228)\n\n\n\nAgainst this condition it has also been argued that it is not\nnecessary that it be an intention to deceive the addressee about either\nthe content of the untruthful statement or about the beliefs of the\nspeaker about the untruthful statement. It is sufficient that there is\nan intention to deceive about some matter\u2014that is, it\nis sufficient that the speaker intend that the hearer believe to be\ntrue something that the speaker believes to be false. Note\nthat those who make this objection would turn lying into any\ndeception involving untruthful statements. If this\nobjection were combined with the objection that lying could be directed\nto third parties (as in bogus disclosure, or disclosure), L1 could be\nmodified, as follows:\n\n(L4)\nTo lie =df to make a believed-false statement, to\nanother person or in the believed hearing of another person, with the\nintention that some other person\u2014the person addressed or the\nother person in the believed hearing\u2014believe some\nbelieved-false statement to be true. (Newey 1997, 100)\n\n\n\nAgainst this condition it has also been objected that although there\nis \u201ca necessary relationship between lying and deception,\u201d\nnevertheless this intention should be understood merely as the\nintention to be deceptive to another person, which is the\nintention \u201cto conceal information\u201d from the other\nperson (Lackey 2013, 5\u20137). According to this objection, concealing\nevidence, understood as hiding evidence or keeping evidence secret,\ncounts as being deceptive to another person. L1 could be modified, as\nfollows:\n\n(L5)\nx lies to y if and only if (i) x states\nthat p to y, (ii) x believes that p is\nfalse and (iii) x intends to be deceptive to y in\nstating that p. (Lackey 2013, 237)\n\n\n\nFinally, against this intention to deceive the addressee condition it\nhas been objected that no intention to deceive is required for lying\n(Shibles 1985, 33; Kemp and Sullivan 1993, 153; Griffiths 2004, 31;\nCarson et al. 1982; Carson 1988; 2006; 2010; Sorensen 2007;\n2010; 2011; Fallis, 2009; 2010; 2012; 2015; Saul, 2012a; 2012b; Stokke\n2013a, 2013b; 2014; Shiffrin 2014). If the sworn-in witness in the\ntrial of a violent criminal goes on the record and gives untruthful\ntestimony\u2014in order, for example, to avoid being killed by the\ndefendant or any of his criminal associates\u2014without any\nintention that that testimony be believed to be true by any person\n(not the jury, the judge, the lawyers, the journalists covering the\ntrial, the people in the gallery, the readers of the newspaper\nreports, etc.), then the witness is still lying (but see Jones\n1986). Such non-deceptive lies are lies according to this objection\n(but see Lackey 2013 for the argument that these lies are\nintentionally deceptive, and Fallis 2015 for the argument that they\nare not intentionally deceptive).\n1.5.2 Conditions Are Not Jointly Sufficient\n\n\nIt has been objected that L1 is not sufficient for lying because it is\nalso necessary that the untruthful statement be false (Coleman and Kay\n1981, 28; OED, 1989; Moore 2000). This is the falsity\ncondition for lying (Grimaltos and Rosell forthcoming, see Other\nInternet Resources). For most objectors the falsity condition\nsupplements L1 and makes this definition of lying even narrower (e.g.,\nColeman and Kay 1981). For other objectors the falsity condition is\npart of a different definition of lying, and makes that definition\nnarrower (Carson 2006, 284; 2010, 17; Saul 2012b, 6).\n\n\nIt has been objected that L1 is not sufficient for lying because it is\nalso necessary to intend that that other person believe that that\nstatement is believed to be true (Frankfurt 1999, 96; Simpson\n1992, 625; Faulkner 2007, 527). If Harry makes the untruthful\nstatement \u201cI have no change in my pocket\u201d to Michael, but\nHarry does not intend that Michael believe that Harry believes it to\nbe true, then Harry is not lying to Michael, even if Harry intends\nthat Michael believe it to be true (Frankfurt 1986, 85; 1999,\n96). This additional condition would make L1 even narrower, since it\nwould have the result that Maximilian is not lying to Alessandro in\nthe example above.\n\n\nFinally, it has been objected that L1 is insufficient because lying\nrequires that an untruthful assertion be made, and not merely\nthat an untruthful statement be made. This is the assertion condition\nfor lying. According to this objection, one is not lying when one makes\na deceptive untruthful ironic statement (\u2018irony lie\u2019), or a\ndeceptive untruthful joke (\u2018joke lie\u2019), or a deceptive\nuntruthful fiction (\u2018fiction lie\u2019), or deceptive untruthful\nacting (\u2018acting life\u2019), since in none of these cases is one\nmaking an assertion. For most objectors the assertion condition\nsupplements L1 and makes L1 even narrower (Chisholm and Feehan\n1977; Fried 1978; Simpson 1992; Williams 2002; Faulkner 2007). For\nothers the assertion condition is part of a different definition of\nlying, and makes that definition narrower (Sorensen 2007;\nFallis 2009; Stokke 2013a).\n\n\nThe most important objection to L1 is that lying does not require an\nintention to deceive. This has led to a division amongst\nthose writing on the definition of lying.\n",
