    "main_text": "Main Debates || Human-Robot Interaction\n2.5 Human-Robot Interaction\n\nHuman-robot interaction (HRI) is an academic fields in its own right,\nwhich now pays significant attention to ethical matters, the dynamics\nof perception from both sides, and both the different interests\npresent in and the intricacy of the social context, including\nco-working (e.g., Arnold and Scheutz 2017). Useful surveys for the\nethics of robotics include Calo, Froomkin, and Kerr (2016); Royakkers\nand van Est (2016); Tzafestas (2016); a standard collection of papers\nis Lin, Abney, and Jenkins (2017).\n\nWhile AI can be used to manipulate humans into believing and doing\nthings (see\n section 2.2),\n it can also be used to drive robots that are problematic if their\nprocesses or appearance involve deception, threaten human dignity, or\nviolate the Kantian requirement of \u201crespect for humanity\u201d.\nHumans very easily attribute mental properties to objects, and\nempathise with them, especially when the outer appearance of these\nobjects is similar to that of living beings. This can be used to\ndeceive humans (or animals) into attributing more intellectual or even\nemotional significance to robots or AI systems than they deserve. Some\nparts of humanoid robotics are problematic in this regard (e.g.,\nHiroshi Ishiguro\u2019s remote-controlled Geminoids), and there are\ncases that have been clearly deceptive for public-relations purposes\n(e.g. on the abilities of Hanson Robotics\u2019\n\u201cSophia\u201d). Of course, some fairly basic constraints of\nbusiness ethics and law apply to robots, too: product safety and\nliability, or non-deception in advertisement. It appears that these\nexisting constraints take care of many concerns that are raised. There\nare cases, however, where human-human interaction has aspects that\nappear specifically human in ways that can perhaps not be replaced by\nrobots: care, love, and sex.\n2.5.1 Example (a) Care Robots\n\nThe use of robots in health care for humans is currently at the level\nof concept studies in real environments, but it may become a usable\ntechnology in a few years, and has raised a number of concerns for a\ndystopian future of de-humanised care (A. Sharkey and N. Sharkey 2011;\nRobert Sparrow 2016). Current systems include robots that support\nhuman carers/caregivers (e.g., in lifting patients, or transporting\nmaterial), robots that enable patients to do certain things by\nthemselves (e.g., eat with a robotic arm), but also robots that are\ngiven to patients as company and comfort (e.g., the \u201cParo\u201d\nrobot seal). For an overview, see van Wynsberghe (2016);\nN\u00f8rskov (2017); Fosch-Villaronga and Albo-Canals (2019), for a\nsurvey of users Draper et al. (2014).\n\nOne reason why the issue of care has come to the fore is that people\nhave argued that we will need robots in ageing societies. This\nargument makes problematic assumptions, namely that with longer\nlifespan people will need more care, and that it will not be possible\nto attract more humans to caring professions. It may also show a bias\nabout age (Jecker forthcoming). Most importantly, it ignores the\nnature of automation, which is not simply about replacing humans, but\nabout allowing humans to work more efficiently. It is not very clear\nthat there really is an issue here since the discussion mostly focuses\non the fear of robots de-humanising care, but the actual and\nforeseeable robots in care are assistive robots for classic automation\nof technical tasks. They are thus \u201ccare robots\u201d only in a\nbehavioural sense of performing tasks in care environments, not in the\nsense that a human \u201ccares\u201d for the patients. It appears\nthat the success of \u201cbeing cared for\u201d relies on this\nintentional sense of \u201ccare\u201d, which foreseeable robots\ncannot provide. If anything, the risk of robots in care is the\nabsence of such intentional care\u2014because less human\ncarers may be needed. Interestingly, caring for something, even a\nvirtual agent, can be good for the carer themselves (Lee et al. 2019).\nA system that pretends to care would be deceptive and thus\nproblematic\u2014unless the deception is countered by sufficiently\nlarge utility gain (Coeckelbergh 2016). Some robots that pretend to\n\u201ccare\u201d on a basic level are available (Paro seal) and\nothers are in the making. Perhaps feeling cared for by a machine, to\nsome extent, is progress for come patients.\n2.5.2 Example (b) Sex Robots\n\nIt has been argued by several tech optimists that humans will likely\nbe interested in sex and companionship with robots and be comfortable\nwith the idea (Levy 2007). Given the variation of human sexual\npreferences, including sex toys and sex dolls, this seems very likely:\nThe question is whether such devices should be manufactured and\npromoted, and whether there should be limits in this touchy area. It\nseems to have moved into the mainstream of \u201crobot\nphilosophy\u201d in recent times (Sullins 2012; Danaher and McArthur\n2017; N. Sharkey et al. 2017 [OIR]; Bendel 2018; Devlin 2018).\n\nHumans have long had deep emotional attachments to objects, so perhaps\ncompanionship or even love with a predictable android is attractive,\nespecially to people who struggle with actual humans, and already\nprefer dogs, cats, birds, a computer or a tamagotchi. Danaher\n(2019b) argues against (Nyholm and Frank 2017) that these can be true\nfriendships, and is thus a valuable goal. It certainly looks like such\nfriendship might increase overall utility, even if lacking in depth.\nIn these discussions there is an issue of deception, since a robot\ncannot (at present) mean what it says, or have feelings for a human.\nIt is well known that humans are prone to attribute feelings and\nthoughts to entities that behave as if they had sentience,even to\nclearly inanimate objects that show no behaviour at all. Also, paying\nfor deception seems to be an elementary part of the traditional sex\nindustry.\n\nFinally, there are concerns that have often accompanied matters of\nsex, namely consent (Frank and Nyholm 2017), aesthetic concerns, and\nthe worry that humans may be \u201ccorrupted\u201d by certain\nexperiences. Old fashioned though this may seem, human behaviour is\ninfluenced by experience, and it is likely that pornography or sex\nrobots support the perception of other humans as mere objects of\ndesire, or even recipients of abuse, and thus ruin a deeper sexual and\nerotic experience. In this vein, the \u201cCampaign Against Sex\nRobots\u201d argues that these devices are a continuation of slavery\nand prostitution (Richardson 2016).\n",
