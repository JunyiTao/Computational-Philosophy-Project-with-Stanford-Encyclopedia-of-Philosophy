    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws || Liberty\n4.2 Liberty\n\n\nMontesquieu is among the greatest philosophers of liberalism, but his\nis what Shklar has called \"a liberalism of fear\" (Shklar,\nMontesquieu, p. 89). According to Montesquieu, political\nliberty is \"a tranquillity of mind arising from the opinion each\nperson has of his safety\" (SL 11.6). Liberty is not the freedom to do\nwhatever we want: if we have the freedom to harm others, for instance,\nothers will also have the freedom to harm us, and we will have no\nconfidence in our own safety. Liberty involves living under laws that\nprotect us from harm while leaving us free to do as much as possible,\nand that enable us to feel the greatest possible confidence that if we\nobey those laws, the power of the state will not be directed against\nus.\n\n If it is to provide its citizens with the greatest possible liberty,\na government must have certain features. First, since \"constant\nexperience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse\nit ... it is necessary from the very nature of things that power\nshould be a check to power\" (SL 11.4). This is achieved through the\nseparation of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers of\ngovernment. If different persons or bodies exercise these powers, then\neach can check the others if they try to abuse their powers. But if\none person or body holds several or all of these powers, then nothing\nprevents that person or body from acting tyrannically; and the people\nwill have no confidence in their own security.\n\n Certain arrangements make it easier for the three powers to check one\nanother. Montesquieu argues that the legislative power alone should\nhave the power to tax, since it can then deprive the executive of\nfunding if the latter attempts to impose its will\narbitrarily. Likewise, the executive power should have the right to\nveto acts of the legislature, and the legislature should be composed\nof two houses, each of which can prevent acts of the other from\nbecoming law. The judiciary should be independent of both the\nlegislature and the executive, and should restrict itself to applying\nthe laws to particular cases in a fixed and consistent manner, so that\n\"the judicial power, so terrible to mankind, \u2026 becomes, as it were,\ninvisible\", and people \"fear the office, but not the magistrate\" (SL\n11.6).\n\n Liberty also requires that the laws concern only threats to public\norder and security, since such laws will protect us from harm while\nleaving us free to do as many other things as possible. Thus, for\ninstance, the laws should not concern offenses against God, since He\ndoes not require their protection. They should not prohibit what they\ndo not need to prohibit: \"all punishment which is not derived from\nnecessity is tyrannical. The law is not a mere act of power; things in\ntheir own nature indifferent are not within its province\" (SL 19.14).\nThe laws should be constructed to make it as easy as possible for\ncitizens to protect themselves from punishment by not committing\ncrimes. They should not be vague, since if they were, we might never\nbe sure whether or not some particular action was a crime. Nor should\nthey prohibit things we might do inadvertently, like bumping into a\nstatue of the emperor, or involuntarily, like doubting the wisdom of\none of his decrees; if such actions were crimes, no amount of effort\nto abide by the laws of our country would justify confidence that we\nwould succeed, and therefore we could never feel safe from criminal\nprosecution. Finally, the laws should make it as easy as possible for\nan innocent person to prove his or her innocence. They should concern\noutward conduct, not (for instance) our thoughts and dreams, since\nwhile we can try to prove that we did not perform some action, we\ncannot prove that we never had some thought. The laws should not\ncriminalize conduct that is inherently hard to prove, like witchcraft;\nand lawmakers should be cautious when dealing with crimes like sodomy,\nwhich are typically not carried out in the presence of several\nwitnesses, lest they \"open a very wide door to calumny\" (SL 12.6).\n\n Montesquieu's emphasis on the connection between liberty and the\ndetails of the criminal law were unusual among his contemporaries, and\ninspired such later legal reformers as Cesare Beccaria.\n",
