    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || Getting Nearer to the Truth\n2.3 Getting Nearer to the Truth\n\nCan a history-fed argument be used in defence of realism?\nWilliam Newton-Smith (1981) was perhaps the first in the recent debate\nto answer positively this question. Scientific realism is committed to\nthe two following theses:\n\n theories are true or false in virtue of how the world is, and\n the point of the scientific enterprise is to discover explanatory\ntruths about the world.\n\n\nAccording to Newton-Smith, (2) is under threat \u201cif we reflect on\nthe fact that all physical theories in the past have had their heyday\nand have eventually been rejected as false\u201d. And he added:\n\n\nIndeed, there is inductive support for a pessimistic induction: any\ntheory will be discovered to be false within, say 200 years of being\npropounded. We may think of some of our current theories as being\ntrue. But modesty requires us to assume that they are not so. For what\nis so special about the present? We have good inductive grounds for\nconcluding that current theories\u2014even our most favourite\nones\u2014will come to be seen to be false. Indeed the evidence might\neven be held to support the conclusion that no theory that will ever\nbe discovered by the human race is strictly speaking true. So how can\nit be rational to pursue that which we have evidence for thinking can\nnever be reached? (1981: 14)\n\n\nThe key answer to this question is that even if truth cannot be\nreached, it is enough for the defense of realism to posit \u201can\ninterim goal for the scientific enterprise\u201d, viz., \u201cthe\ngoal of getting nearer the truth\u201d. If this is the goal, the\n\u201csting\u201d of the preceding induction \u201cis\nremoved\u201d. Accepting PI \u201cis compatible with maintaining\nthat current theories, while strictly speaking false, are getting\nnearer the truth\u201d (1981: 14).\n\nBut aren\u2019t all false theories equally false? The standard\nrealist answer is based on what Newton-Smith called \u201cthe animal\nfarm move\u201d (1981: 184), viz., that though all theories are\nfalse, some are truer than others. Hence, what was needed to be\ndefended was the thesis that if a theory \\(T_2\\) has greater\nverisimilitude than a theory \\(T_1\\), \\(T_2\\) is likely to have\ngreater observational success than \\(T_1\\). The key argument was based\non the \u201cundeniable fact\u201d that newer theories have yielded\nbetter predictions about the world than older ones (cf. Newton-Smith\n1981: 196). But if the \u2018greater verisimilitude\u2019 thesis is\ncorrect (that is, if theories \u201care increasing in truth-content\nwithout increasing in falsity-content\u201d), then the increase in\npredictive power would be explained and rendered expectable. This\nincrease in predictive power \u201cwould be totally mystifying\n(\u2026) if it were not for the fact that theories are capturing\nmore and more truth about the world\u201d (1981: 196).\n\nThe key point, then, is that the defense of realism against the\nhistorical induction requires showing that there is, indeed, a\nprivilege that current theories enjoy over past ones, which is strong\nenough to block transferring, on inductive grounds, features of past\ntheories to current ones. For most realists, the privilege current\ntheories enjoy over past ones is not that they are true while the past\ntheories are false. Rather, the privilege is that they are more\ntruthlike than past theories because they have had more predictive\npower than past theories. The privilege is underpinned by an\nexplanatory argument: the increasing truthlikeness of current theories\nbest explains their increasing predictive and empirical\nsuccess.\n\nBut there is a way to see the historical challenge to realism which\nmakes it have as its target precisely to undercut the explanatory link\nbetween empirical success and truthlikeness. This was brought\nunder sharp relief in the subsequent debates.\n",
