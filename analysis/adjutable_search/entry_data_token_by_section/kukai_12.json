    "main_text": "Thought || 2 Ten States in the Development of the Mind\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAmong the better known philosophers of the Kyoto School, references to\nK\u016bkai or Shingon, when compared to Zen or Pure Land Buddhism, are\nhardly noticeable. It has been suggested that this neglect may have\nsomething to do with an intellectual\u2019s prejudice against the\n\u201cesoteric,\u201d e.g. the significance of ritual with its\nsymbols and images, which are not so easily amenable to rational\ncomprehension and instead conjure up preconceptions of the\n\u201coccult\u201d and the \u201cmagical.\u201d However the\nphilosophical aspects of Shingon Buddhism are often traceable to the\nsame Mah\u0101y\u0101na seeds that sprouted Zen. Once such prejudices\nare overcome, it would not be so difficult for the contemporary\nphilosopher to find in K\u016bkai a well-spring of ideas and thoughts\nwhich may be of interest today.\n\nWe need to acknowledge, however, that K\u016bkai and Shingon Buddhism\nin general have not altogether been ignored by contemporary\nphilosophers of Japan. Even within the Kyoto School, its current\nrepresentative Ueda Shizuteru in a 1993 lecture, Basho to\nmandara, discusses the significance of mandalas in Shingon\nBuddhism in relation to the ontological structure of human existence\nunderstood in his terms as being-in-the-twofold-world. In his analysis\nof K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalas, Ueda approriates contemporary\nphilosophical concepts, such as Nishida\u2019s \u201cplace\u201d\n(basho), Nishitani\u2019s \u201cfield\u201d (ba),\nand Heidegger\u2019s \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d\n(In-der-Welt-sein), and takes the mandala as indicative of\nthe always assumed semantic space (imi k\u016bkan) belonging\nto the world (sekai) as the total framework of meanings\n(imi no waku gumi) wherein we find ourselves. A couple of\nother graduates of Kyoto University\u2019s philosophy department have\nentire books on K\u016bkai. In K\u016bkai no shis\u014d ni\ntsuite, Umehara Takeshi discusses K\u016bkai both as a religious\npractitioner and as a theorist, who explicates the world\u2019s\ninfinite \u201ctreasure\u201d unfolding within the self. And\nex-Nishidian turned Marxist, Yanagida Kenj\u016br\u014d, has a study\non K\u016bkai and his works: Nihon shingon no tetsugaku:\nK\u016bkai Hiz\u014dh\u014dyaku to Ben\u2019kenmitsu\nniky\u014dron.\n\nAmong other twentieth century Japanese philosophers, Yuasa Yasuo,\nknown for his theory of the body, often refers to the doctrines and\npractices of Shingon Buddhism, and has writen entire chapters on\nK\u016bkai in Shintairon: T\u014dy\u014dteki shinshin ron to\ngendai and The Body: Towards an Eastern Mind-Body\nTheory. Comparative philosopher of religion, Izutsu Toshihiko, as\nwell, in Ishiki to honshitsu and other works, has found\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas \u2013 especially his\ncosmological-linguistic theory \u2013 inspiring enough to incorporate\ninto his own theory of essence as part of his attempt to build a\nsynthetic \u201cOriental philosophy\u201d (t\u014dy\u014d\ntetsugaku). Philosopher of Buddhist thought, Tamaki\nK\u014dshir\u014d discusses the significance of K\u016bkai\u2019s\nphilosophy within the history of Japanese Buddhism in his Nihon\nbukky\u014d shis\u014d ron. And philosopher of religion and\nreligious studies scholar Nakazawa Shin\u2019ichi, like Ueda, focuses\non K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalic philosophy in his book, Seppen\nkyokusenron. He reads K\u016bkai\u2019s works on Shingon as\ninvolving a hydrodynamic mode of thinking that in its flexibility\ndeals with the non-Euclidean currents of nature with its forces of\nreality, undulating in ripples and forming vortexes. He views the\nShingon mandala as approximating, with its circles and lines, what is\nexpressed in today\u2019s fractal geometry, whereby the\ninfinitesimally microcosmic part endlessly and indefinitely iterates\nthe patterns of the whole of nature in its innumerable vortexes and\ncurves.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas engender an holistic view towards nature and\nthe cosmos as encompassing ourselves and in our interrelationships\nwith others. They may be of relevance to the dilemmas we face today in\nthis epoch of globalization, religious wars, technological\n\u201cenframing\u201d (to use Heidegger\u2019s terminology), and\nenvironmental hazards. And in terms of scholarship, as can be seen in\nsome of the above-mentioned Japanese scholars\u2019 works on\nK\u016bka, K\u016bkai offers a wealth of ideas for comparative\nanalyses: e.g. with Derrida on the world as text, with Process thought\non \u201ccosmo-holism,\u201d with Merleau-Ponty or Deleuze on the\nsignificance of the body and bodily spatiality and interrelationality\nvis-\u00e0-vis the environment, with Nishida or Hegel on dialectics\nand interrelationality, or with major \u201cmystic\u201d thinkers of\nother religious traditions such as Ibn Arabi of Islam or Meister\nEckhart of Christianity on a dynamic non-duality as opposed to both\nstatic monism and subject-object dualism. K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking\nprovides a wealth of insights, of much value, to offer to philosophers\nof today. \n",
