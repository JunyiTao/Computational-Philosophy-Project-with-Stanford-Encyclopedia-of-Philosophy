    "main_text": "Standards of Proof\n5. Standards of Proof\n\nAfter the evidence has been presented, examined and cross-examined at\ntrial, trained judges or lay jurors must reach a decision (see Laudan\n2010 for a few caveats on what the decision should be about). The\ndecision criterion is defined by law and consists of a standard of\nproof, also called the burden of persuasion. If the evidence against\nthe defendant is sufficiently strong to meet the requisite proof\nstandard, the defendant should be found liable. This section begins\nwith a description of standards of proof in the law, then outlines a\nprobabilistic account of standards of proof, and discusses\nsome objections to this account.\n",
