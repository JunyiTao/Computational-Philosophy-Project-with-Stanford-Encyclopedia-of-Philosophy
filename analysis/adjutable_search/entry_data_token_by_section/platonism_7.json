    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument || Sentence Types\n4.4 Sentence Types\n\nLinguistics is a branch of science that tells us things about\nsentences. For instance, it says things like\n\n(A) \u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019 is a well-formed sentence of\nEnglish,\n\n\nand\n\n(B) \u2018Visiting relatives can be boring\u2019 is structurally\nambiguous.\n\n\nThe quoted sentences that appear in (A) and (B) are singular terms;\ne.g., \u201c\u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019\u201d refers to the\nsentence \u2018The cat is on the mat\u2019, and (A) says of this\nsentence that it has a certain property, namely, that of being a\nwell-formed English sentence. Thus, if sentences like (A) are true\n\u2014 and it certainly seems that they are \u2014 then they commit\nus to believing in the existence of sentences. Now, one might hold a\nphysicalistic view here according to which linguistics is about actual\n(external) sentence tokens, e.g., piles of ink and verbal sound waves.\n(This view was popular in the early part of the 20th\ncentury \u2014 see, e.g., Bloomfield (1933), Harris (1954), and Quine\n(1953).) Or alternatively, one might hold a conceptualistic view,\nmaintaining that linguistics is essentially a branch of psychology;\nthe main proponent of this view is Noam Chomsky (1965, chapter 1), who\nthinks of a grammar for a natural language as being about an ideal\nspeaker-hearer's knowledge of the given language, but see also Sapir\n(1921), Stich (1972), and Fodor (1981). But there are reasons for\nthinking that neither the physicalist nor the conceptualist approach\nis tenable and that the only plausible way to interpret linguistic\ntheory is as being about sentence types, which of course, are abstract\nobjects (proponents of the platonistic view include Katz (1981),\nSoames (1985), and Langendoen and Postal (1985)). Katz constructs\narguments here that are very similar to the ones we considered above,\nin connection with mathematical objects\n (section 4.1).\n One argument here is that linguistic theory seems to have\nconsequences that are (a) true and (b) about sentences that have never\nbeen tokened (internally or externally), e.g., sentences like\n\u2018Green Elvises slithered unwittingly toward Arizona's favorite\ntoaster\u2019. (Of course, now that I've written this sentence down,\nit has been tokened, but it seems likely that before I wrote it down,\nit had never been tokened.) Standard linguistic theory entails that\nmany sentences that have never been tokened (internally or externally)\nare well-formed English sentences. Thus, if we want to claim that our\nlinguistic theories are true, then we have to accept these\nconsequences, or theorems, of linguistic theory. But these theorems\nare clearly not true of any sentence tokens (because the sentences in\nquestion have never been tokened) and so, it is argued, they must be\ntrue of sentence types.\n",
