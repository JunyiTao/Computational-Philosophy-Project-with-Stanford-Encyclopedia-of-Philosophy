    "main_text": "Life, works, and influence || Indian philosophical debate in the middle of the first millennium\n1.1 Indian philosophical debate in the middle of the first millennium\n\n\nHaving flourished in the latter part of the seventh\ncentury ce, Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nwas roughly contemporaneous with the Buddhist philosopher\nDharmak\u012brti, whose own predecessor Dign\u0101ga was among the philosophical rivals whom Kum\u0101rila critically engaged; Kum\u0101rila has long been recognized as a significant influence on his younger contemporary \u015aa\u1e45kara\n(fl. c. 710). Kum\u0101rila thus wrote at a time of profoundly significant\nphilosophical activity in India, contributing much to a pan-Sanskritic\ndiscourse\u2014sometimes referred to as\npram\u0101\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra, or the \u201cdiscipline of epistemic warrants\u201d\u2014that was\ncharacterized by shared standards of rationality and inter-traditional\ndebate. Pressed from all sides by opponents from rival schools of thought, Indian philosophers at this time were keen to maintain the consistency of their various commitments in the face of critique; with all these disputants sharing a Sanskritic philosophical vocabulary that had been refined particularly by Buddhists, India\u2019s philosophical traditions quickly developed in subtlety and sophistication from this point on.\n\n\nCharacteristic of this period of inter-traditional debate is the\nlegendary account of Kum\u0101rila as having studied for a time at the\nfamous Buddhist monastic university at N\u0101land\u0101, then in its\nprime. Based on the mastery of Buddhist doctrine he thus gained,\nKum\u0101rila went on to decisively counter Buddhist\nphilosophical positions. According to a Buddhist variation on such\nlegendary reflections of the state of philosophical contestation (one\nrecorded by the 17th-century Tibetan historian T\u0101ran\u0101tha),\nKum\u0101rila is indeed represented as having defeated various lesser\nBuddhist thinkers in debate. However, his renown prompted the Buddhist\nDharmak\u012brti, in turn, to go in disguise to study with\nKum\u0101rila,\nfrom whom Dharmak\u012brti learns\nthe key to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s thought and then bests him in debate,\nconverting Kum\u0101rila and his followers to Buddhism. As history,\nsuch accounts are surely as suspect as the view (still attested\nin some Indian scholarship) that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s dialectical\nsuccesses are chiefly to be credited for the decline of Indian\nBuddhism. Nevertheless, these traditions confirm at least that\nKum\u0101rila was a formidable philosophical opponent of his Buddhist\ncounterparts. It is fitting, then, that among the sources for studying\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s thought should be not only the texts of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commentators on his work\u2014particularly U\u1e43veka\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da (fl. c. 710), P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra (fl.\nc. 1075), and Sucaritami\u015bra (c.1120)\u2014but also the work of the scholar Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (c.725\u2013788), whose massive\nTattvasa\u1e43graha extensively engages (and quotes from the\nworks of) Kum\u0101rila.\n",
