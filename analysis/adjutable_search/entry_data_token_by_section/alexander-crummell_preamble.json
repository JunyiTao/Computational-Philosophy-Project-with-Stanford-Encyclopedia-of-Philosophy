    "main_text": "\n\n\nAlexander Crummell (1819\u20131898) was the most prominent rationalist of\nthe black American enlightenment thinkers in the nineteenth-century. He\nstands out among his contemporaries\u2014Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia\nCooper, Booker T. Washington, most notably\u2014for his robust defense of\nthe central place of reason in moral agency. His attempts to work out\nthe consequences of that view for the nature of language and history\nlends his philosophy a breadth and depth not matched by other\nenlightenment thinkers. The prominence of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, W.\nE. B. Du Bois, helped ensure Crummell's continuing influence during the\nrise of pragmatism, but he eventually fell out of favor as such\nrelativistic thinkers as Alain LeRoy Locke and Zora Neale Hurston\nemerged.\n",
