Politics, Consequentialism and the Need for Skepticism\n\nDry and abstract as these disputes may seem, they are not devoid of\npractical import. A common complaint against consequentialism is that\nit encourages the consequentialist to do evil that good may come. If\nthe goods to be achieved or the evils to be averted are sufficiently\nlarge, it may be not only permissible but obligatory to\ntorture prisoners, execute hostages or to massacre civilians\u2014so\nlong as there is no other, less costly, way to achieve the goods or\navert the evils. This is not only objectionable in itself\u2014it\nencourages ruthless types to commit horrors in the here and now for\nthe sake of some imagined utopia, whilst pretending to themselves and\nothers that they are actuated by the highest motives. Because in\nprinciple consequentialism licenses doing evil that good may\ncome, in practice it encourages fanatics to do evil even when\nthe good to come is highly unlikely. In his \u201cNewly Discovered\nMaxims of la Rochefoucauld\u201d, Russell remarks that \u201cthe\npurpose of morality is to allow people to inflict suffering without\ncompunction\u201d (Fact and Fiction: 184). And\nconsequentialist moralities have enabled some of their devotees to\ninflict a great deal of suffering, not only without compunction, but\noften with an insufferable air of moral smugness.\n\nBy adopting expected utility as the criterion of right action\nRussell goes some way towards meeting these objections. In practice\nwhen people propose to perpetrate horrors for the sake of some greater\ngood, the horrors are usually certain and the greater good is highly\nspeculative. In weighing up the options, the good to be achieved by\nsome tough course of action must be multiplied by the probability of\nachieving it, which is always a fraction of one, and often a rather\nsmall fraction at that. So although doing evil that good may come is\nnot excluded in principle, the expected utility theorist is\nfar less likely to do it in practice\u2014at least if he or she is\nintellectually honest. The classless society (let us suppose) would be\na very good thing, but I am probably not justified in shooting the\nhostages to bring it about. For I can be certain that if I shoot them,\nthe hostages will be dead, whereas the probability that shooting them\nwill bring about the classless society is very low. Moreover there is\nlikely to be an as-good-or-better chance that I can bring about the\nclassless society without shooting the hostages. Thus even if\nthe classless society would be supremely good, the expected utility\ntheorist will not be justified in shooting the hostages to bring it\nabout. The expected utility theorist may be obliged to do evil that\ngood may come, but only if the good is large, highly likely given the\nevil, and most unlikely without the evil. These conditions\nare seldom met.\n\nThus Russell could use the criterion of expected utility\nagainst warmongers and enthusiasts for revolutionary violence who\nemployed utilitarian patterns of reasoning to inflict suffering\nwithout compunction. It was (for example) one of his chief weapons in\nhis polemics against the Bolsheviks during the 1920s. As he wrote in a\nreview of Bukharin\u2019s Historical Materialism,\n\n\nwe do not know enough about the laws of social phenomena to be able to\npredict the future with any certainty, even in its broadest outlines\n\u2026 For this reason, it is unwise to adopt any policy involving\ngreat immediate suffering for the sake of even a great gain in the\ndistant future, because the gain may never be realized (RoE:\n203/Papers 9: 371).\n\n\nThus despite the desirability of socialism (in Russell\u2019s eyes at any\nrate) the Bolshevik program had to be rejected for utilitarian or\nconsequentialist reasons. (See also The Practice and Theory\nof Bolshevism, particularly Part II. ch.iv.) The Bolshevik\n\u201chabit of militant certainty about doubtful matters\u201d\n(Practice and Theory: xi) was not only irrational, but\ndangerous, since it led to pointless suffering. Hence\n\u201cThe Need for Political Skepticism\u201d, the title of one of\nRussell\u2019s essays, and a major theme in his moral and political writing\n(Sceptical Essays: ch. 11). Dogmatism leads to cruelty since\nit encourages people to overestimate the likelihood that their\nobjectives will be realized and hence to exaggerate the expected\nutility of persecuting policies. Scepticism (or\n\u201cfallibilism\u201d as we would nowadays tend to say) is the\nantidote. Hence the maxim that Russell puts into the mouth of la\nRochefoucauld: \u201cIt does not matter what you believe, so long as\nyou don\u2019t altogether believe it\u201d (Fact and Fiction:\n185).\n",
