Historical Background and General Characteristics of Philosophy of Biology in Latin America\n\nThe professionalization and institutionalization of philosophy as it\nis understood today took place first in Europe, in the second half of\nthe eighteenth century (Rabossi 2008). This process also first began\nin Europe for philosophy of science in the so-called Vienna Circle\n(1929) and became consolidated after the main Central-European\nphilosophers of science arrived in the United States in the late 1930s\n(Moulines 2008).\n\nThe professionalization of philosophy (Gracia & Vargas 2013\n[2018]; Romero 1944; Rabossi 2003, 2008) and philosophy of science\ntook place between the 1940s and 1960s in most Latin American\ncountries, or as late as the 1970s in others (Cordero 2010, 2015\n[2016]; G\u00f3mez 2011; Marcos & P\u00e9rez Ransanz 2015;\nLombardi, Cordero, & P\u00e9rez Ransanz 2020). However, during\nthose years and the following two decades, less effort was dedicated\nto philosophical reflections on biology compared to physics. Following\nprofessionalization and institutionalization of philosophy of biology\nas a sub-discipline within philosophy of science in regions like the\nUS, Canada, and Europe during the 1970s\u20131980s, the situation\nslowly but consistently changed in Latin America.\n\nLeaving aside the Indigenous Period, three main periods can be\ndistinguished cum grano salis in the philosophy of biology in\nLatin America. The first took place before the professionalization of\nphilosophy of science in the region, the colonial period to the\nmid-twentieth century. The second period, from the mid-twentieth\ncentury to the 1980s and 1990s, came after the professionalization of\nphilosophy of science but before the professionalization of philosophy\nof biology as its own sub-discipline. Finally, the third period began\nin the 1990s and continues today.\n",
