    "main_text": "The Role of Interpretation in Legal Reasoning: || Locating Interpretation in Legal Reasoning\n2.3 Locating Interpretation in Legal Reasoning\n\n\nIt is important to consider how interpretation, as characterised in\nsubsection 2.2 above, fits into the discussion of the ambit of the term\nlegal reasoning in the opening section of this entry. The key to this\nissue lies in interpretation's dualistic nature, i.e. that it has both\na backward-looking conserving aspect and a forward-looking creative\none. This dualism would seem to indicate that in interpreting the law,\njudges both seek to capture and be faithful to the content of the law\nas it currently exists, and to supplement, modify, or bring out\nsomething new in the law, in the course of reasoning from the content\nof the law to a decision in a particular case. In turn, this would seem\nto indicate that interpretation, because of its dualistic nature, has a\nrole to play in both legal reasoning in sense (a), i.e. reasoning to\nestablish the existing content of the law on a given issue, and legal\nreasoning in sense (b), namely reasoning from the existing content of\nthe law to the decision which a court should reach in a case involving\nthat issue which comes before it. \n\n\nOne legal theorist who adopts exactly this approach, and so views\ninterpretation in legal reasoning as \u2018straddling the\ndivide\u2019 between identifying existing law, and developing and\nmodifying the law, is Joseph Raz (see Raz 1996a and 1996b). According\nto Raz, the fact that interpretation has a role to play in both of\nthese activities assists in explaining why we do not find a two-stage\nor clearly bifurcated approach to legal reasoning in judicial\ndecisions. Judges do not first of all engage in legal reasoning in\nsense (a), having recourse only to legal materials, and then, having\nestablished what the existing law is and determined how far it can take\nthem in resolving the instant case, then move on to a separate stage of\nlegal reasoning in sense (b) which requires them to look to extra-legal\nmaterials in order to complete the job, because much of their reasoning\nis interpretive and interpretation straddles the divide between legal\nreasoning in senses (a) and (b). This point may assist Raz in defusing\nsome of the criticisms which have been levelled at the legal positivist\napproach to legal reasoning such as that positivism's account is\nphenomenologically inaccurate because when we examine cases, we do not\nfind two distinct stages to judicial reasoning, one to establish\nwhether any legal rules bear upon the problem at hand, and one wherein\njudges effectively legislate to fill in the gaps when the legal rules\n\u2018run out\u2019 (see e.g. Dworkin 1977 & 1986). As Raz\nhimself notes, however (especially in Raz 1996b), this\n\u2018straddling the divide\u2019 approach may in fact seem to\nundermine the very ideas that there is a tenable distinction between\nlegal reasoning in senses (a) and (b), and that there are gaps in the\nlaw. Interpretation appears to blur or even erase the line between the\nseparate law-finding and law-creating roles which many legal\npositivists ascribe to judges, and the fact that courts always seem to\nbe able to decide cases by interpreting the law may also seem to cast\ndoubt on the idea that the law is incomplete, and hence that judges\nsometimes have to reach outside of the law in the adjudication process.\nInterest in the pervasiveness of interpretation in legal reasoning, and\nin the Janus-faced nature of interpretation may thus form part of the\nbackground which has led legal theorists like Dworkin to deny that the\ndistinction between identifying existing law, and developing and\nchanging the law, as understood by certain legal positivists, is a\ntenable or coherent one. That interpretation appears to operate at\nevery stage in the legal reasoning process may also have influenced\nDworkin's denial that there are gaps in the law, and his counter-claim,\ncontra Hart and Raz, that everything which a judge is entitled to rely\non in deciding a case is already part of the law (see Dworkin\n1986).\n",
