Maybe so; but most quantifiers in fact cannot\nescape from relative clauses. Relative clauses are known as\n\u2018scope islands\u2019, or contexts in which quantifiers\ncan\u2019t be interpreted as raised. In fact, it has been noted that\nindefinites seem to escape from nearly any normal scope island\nwhatsoever. This suggests that treating the various readings as an\nambiguity akin to other scopal ambiguities is mistaken. Another\ntreatment of (77)\u2019s multiplicity of readings involves domain\nrestriction: if we restrict the domain of \u2018a book\u2019 to only\none particular book, we can emulate the reading one would get from\ntreating \u2018a book\u2019 as having wide-scope. Domain restriction\ntraditionally is treated as a matter of context sensitivity rather\nthan ambiguity. We thus have some reason to doubt that the right\ntreatment of (77) has much to do with the phenomenon of scope. (see\nSchwarzchild (2002) for further discussion).\n",
