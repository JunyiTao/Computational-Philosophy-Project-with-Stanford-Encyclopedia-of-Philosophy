    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe laden phrase \u201cidentity politics\u201d has come to signify\na wide range of political activity and theorizing founded in the shared\nexperiences of injustice of members of certain social groups. Rather\nthan organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos,\nor party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to\nsecure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized\nwithin its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or\nreclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge\ndominant characterizations, with the goal of greater\nself-determination.\n",
