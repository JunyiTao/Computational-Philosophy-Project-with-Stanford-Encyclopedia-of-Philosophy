    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || The Mentaculus and the Past-Hypothesis\n4.6 The Mentaculus and the Past-Hypothesis\n\nAn altogether different approach has been formulated by Albert (2000).\nThis approach focusses on the internal structure of macro-regions and\naims to explain the approach to equilibrium by showing that the\nprobability for system in a non-equilibrium macro-state to evolve\ntoward a macro-state of higher Boltzmann entropy is high. The basis\nfor this discussion is the so-called statistical postulate.\nConsider a particular macro-state \\(M\\) with macro-region \\(X_{M}\\)\nand assume that the system is in macro-state \\(M\\). The postulate then\nsays that for any subset \\(A\\) of \\(X_{M}\\) the probability of finding\nthe system\u2019s micro-state in \\(A\\) is \\({\\mu(A)/\\mu(X}_{M})\\). We\ncan now separate the micro-states in \\(X_{M}\\) into those that evolve\ninto a higher entropy macro-state and those that move toward\nmacro-states of lower entropy. Let\u2019s call these sets\n\\(X_{M}^{+}\\) and \\(X_{M}^{-}\\). The statistical postulate then says\nthat the probability of a system in \\(M\\) evolving toward a higher\nentropy macro-state is \\({\\mu(X}_{M}^{+})/\\mu(X_{M})\\).\n\nFor it to be likely that system approaches equilibrium this\nprobability would have to be high. It now turns out that for purely\nmathematical reasons, if the system is highly likely to evolve toward\na macro-state of higher entropy, then it is also highly likely to have\nevolved into the current macro-state \\(M\\) from a macro-state of high\nentropy. In other words, if the entropy is highly likely to increase\nin the future, it is also highly likely to have decreased in the past.\nAlbert suggests solving this problem by regarding the entire universe\nas the system being studied and then conditionalizing on the\nPast-Hypothesis, which is the assumption that\n\n\nthat the world first came into being in whatever particular\nlow-entropy highly condensed big-bang sort of macrocondition it is\nthat the normal inferential procedures of cosmology will eventually\npresent to us. (2000: 96)\n\n\nLet \\(M_{p}\\) be the past state, the state in which the world\nfirst came into being according to the Past-Hypothesis, and let\n\\(I_{t} = \\phi_{t}(X_{M_{p}}) \\cap X_{M}\\) be the intersection of the\ntime-evolved macro-region of the past state and the current\nmacro-state. The probability of high entropy future is then\n\\({\\mu(I_{t} \\cap X}_{M}^{+})/\\mu(I_{t})\\). If we further assume\n\u201cabnormal\u201d states with low entropy futures are scattered\nall over \\(X_{M}\\), then a high entropy future can be highly likely\nwithout it a high entropy past also being highly likely.\n\nThis approach to SM is based on three core elements: the deterministic\ntime evolution of the system given by \\(\\phi_{t}\\), the\nPast-Hypothesis, and the statistical postulate. Together they result\nin the assignment of a probability to propositions about the history\nof a system. Albert (2015) calls this assignment the\nMentaculus. Albert regards the Mentaculus not only as an\naccount of thermodynamic phenomena, but as the backbone of a complete\nscientific theory of the universe because the Mentaculus assigns\nprobabilities to propositions in all sciences. This raises all kind of\nissues about the nature of laws, reduction, and the status of the\nspecial sciences, which are discussed, for instance, in Frisch (2011),\nHemmo and Shenker (2021) and Myrvold and others (2016).\n\nLike the ergodic approach, the Mentaculus must accommodate\nLoschmidt\u2019s and Zermelo\u2019s objections by rejecting the\nrequirement of strict irreversibility. Higher to lower entropy\ntransitions are still allowed, but they are rendered unlikely, and\nrecurrence can be tamed by noting that the recurrence time for a\ntypical SM system is larger than age of the universe, which means that\nwe won\u2019t observe recurrence (Bricmont 1995; Callender 1999).\nYet, this amounts to admitting that entropy increase is not universal\nand the formalism is compatible with there being periods of decreasing\nentropy at some later point in the history of the universe.\n\nA crucial ingredient of the Mentaculus is the Past-Hypothesis. The\nidea of grounding thermodynamic behaviour in a cosmic low-entropy past\ncan be traced back to Boltzmann (Uffink 2007: 990) and has since been\nadvocated by prominent physicists like Feynman (1965: Ch. 5) and R.\nPenrose (2004: Ch. 27). This raises two questions: first, can the\nPast-Hypothesis be given a precise formulation that serves the purpose\nof SM, and, second, what status does the Past-Hypothesis have and does\nthe fact that the universe started in this particular state require an\nexplanation?\n\nAs regards the first question, Earman has cast the damning verdict\nthat the Past-Hypothesis is \u201cnot even false\u201d (2006)\nbecause in cosmologies described in general relativity there is no\nwell-defined sense in which the Boltzmann entropy has a low value. A\nfurther problem is that in the Mentaculus the Boltzmann entropy is a\nglobal quantity characterising the entire universe. But, as Winsberg\npoints out, the fact that this quantity is low does not imply that the\nentropy of a particular small subsystem of interest is also low, and,\nworse just because the overall entropy of the universe increases it\nneed not be the case that the entropy in a small subsystem also\nincreases (2004a). The source of these difficulties is that the\nMentaculus takes the entire universe to be the relevant system and so\none might try get around them by reverting to where we started:\nlaboratory systems like gases in boxes. One can then\u00a0take the\npast state simply to be the state in which such a gas is prepared at\nthe beginning of a process (say in the left half of the container).\nThis leads to the so-called branch systems approach, because a system\nis seen as \u201cbranching off\u201d from the rest of the universe\nwhen it is isolated from its environment and prepared in\nnon-equilibrium state (Davies 1974; Sklar 1993: 318\u201332). Albert\n(2000) dismisses this option for a number of reasons, chief among them\nthat it is not clear why one should regard the statistical postulate\nas valid for such a state (see Winsberg (2004b) for a discussion).\n\nAs regards the second question, Chen (forthcoming), Goldstein (2001),\nand Loewer (2001) argue that Past-Hypothesis has the status of a\nfundamental law of nature. Albert seems to regard it as something like\na Kantian regulative principle in that its truth must be assumed in\norder to make knowledge of the past possible at all. By contrast,\nCallender, Price, and Wald regard that the Past-Hypothesis a\ncontingent matter of fact, but they disagree on whether this fact\nstands in need of an explanation. Price (1996, 2004) argues that it\ndoes because the crucial question in SM is not why entropy increase,\nbut rather why it ever got to be low in the first place. Callender\n(1998, 2004a, 2004b) disagrees: the Past-Hypothesis simply specifies\ninitial conditions of a process, and initial conditions are not the\nkind of thing that needs to be explained (see also Sklar (1993:\n309\u201318)). Parker (2005) argues that conditionalising on the\ninitial state of the universe does not have the explanatory power to\nexplain irreversible behaviour. Baras and Shenker (2020) and Farr\n(2022) analysed the notion of explanation that is involved in this\ndebate and argue that different questions are in play that require\ndifferent answers.\n",
