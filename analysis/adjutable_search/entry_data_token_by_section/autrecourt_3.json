    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nCentral to Autrecourt\u2019s teaching is the view that all evident\nknowledge (with the exception of the certitude of faith) must be\nreducible to the first principle (primum principium), i.e.,\nto the principle of non-contradiction. An inference yields evident\nknowledge only when the affirmation of its antecedent and the negation\nof its consequent are contradictory. This means that the antecedent and\nthe consequent, or, more precisely, what is signified by the\nantecedent and the consequent, must be identical, \u201cbecause if this\nwere not the case, it would not be immediately evident that the\nantecedent and the opposite of the consequent cannot stand together\nwithout contradiction.\u201d It is in the context of this theory that\nAutrecourt launches an attack on our claim to have certain knowledge\nof the existence of substances and causal relations. If A and B are\ntwo distinct entities, he says, one cannot infer with certainty\n(knowledge of) the existence of A from that of B or vice versa, for\nthe affirmation of the one and the denial of the other does not result\nin a contradiction. On the basis of this principle, one may not infer\n(knowledge of) the existence of effects from knowledge of their\ncauses, nor (knowledge of) the existence of substances from knowledge\nof their accidents. Autrecourt\u2019s theory about the evidentness of\ninferences was contested by his contemporaries and should be\nunderstood in the light of the late-medieval theory of\nconsequences.\n\n\nThis view runs contrary to the Aristotelian position, according to\nwhich causal relations really exist and are discoverable by means of\ninduction, so that the existence of substances can be inferred from the\nperceptible accidents inhering in them. The upshot of Autrecourt\u2019s view\nis that we do not have experience of causal relations or substances,\nnor does logic provide certain knowledge of them. There are no logical\nreasons to assume that there is an evident relation between a cause and\nan effect, or between a substance and an accident.\n\n\nThe position outlined above is developed in Autrecourt\u2019s\ncorrespondence. It has led historians of philosophy to characterize\nhim as the most important, if not the only, \u201creal\u201d\nrepresentative of medieval scepticism, as \u201cthe medieval\nHume\u201d, to use Hastings Rashdall\u2019s epithet. On closer\ninspection, however, it turns out that Autrecourt\u2019s scepticism\nis reserved for rationalist claims about the truth of our commitments\nto causality and substance, concepts for which we have no empirical\nproof. It is now generally agreed that he is not a sceptic at all when\nit comes to defending the reliability of sense-perception.\n\n\nIn his Letter to Bernard, Autrecourt takes on Bernard of\nArezzo, who had argued that the intellect is neither certain of the\nexistence of those things of which it has a clear intuitive cognition,\nnor of its own acts. Autrecourt reveals the full implications of this\nposition by pointing out to Bernard that \u201cyou are not certain of\nthose things which are outside of you. And so you do not know if you\nare in the sky or on earth, in fire or in water...Similarly, you do\nnot know what things exist in your immediate surroundings, such as\nwhether you have a head, a beard, hair, and the like.\u201d He\nconcludes that Bernard\u2019s stance is even worse than that of\n\u201cthe Academics,\u201d that is, the ancient Skeptics.\n",
