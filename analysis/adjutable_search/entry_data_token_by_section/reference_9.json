    "main_text": "Four Models of Linguistic Reference\n5. Four Models of Linguistic Reference\n\nBy looking at how philosophers have attempted to account for the\nreferential features of various sorts of linguistic terms, we have\neffectively introduced four distinct ways of conceiving of how\nreferential terms might come to refer to particular objects and\nindividuals in the world. In other words, we have introduced four\ndistinct models for the metasemantics of referential terms: \n\n1. On the descriptivist model, words refer in virtue of being\nassociated with a specific descriptive content that serves to identify\na particular object or individual as the referent.\n\n2. On the causal model, words refer in virtue of being associated with\nchains of use leading back to an initiating use or\n\u2018baptism\u2019 of the referent.\n\n3. On the character model, words refer in virtue of being associated\nwith regular rules of reference. Paradigm rules of this sort will\nthemselves allude to repeatable elements of the context,\nidentifying which of these elements is the referent for which sort of\nterm.\n\n4. On the intentionalist model, words refer in virtue of being used,\nintentionally, to refer to particular objects. In other words, words\nrefer in virtue of their being uttered as part of complex intentional\nacts which somehow target particular objects or individuals.\n\nAs should be clear by now, these four models aren\u2019t strictly exclusive\nof each other. One might, for instance, think of the classical\ndescriptivism\u2014which appeals to the speaker\u2019s mental state in\norder to associate a particular description with a particular token\nreferential term\u2014as a particular version of intentionalism.\nPresumably, speakers will only manifest the right sort of mental state\nwhen they are intentionally using a referential term to refer.\nLikewise, one might view the causal theory as a special case of the\ncharacter theory: in the case of terms like names, the invariant rule\nof use associated with a particular name is itself to be explained in\nterms of a chain of uses leading back to a specific object or\nindividual. In fact, if one is willing to allow the characters of\ncertain sorts of terms, like the demonstratives, to allude to the\nspeaker\u2019s referential intentions, then character theorists can\ncountenance a certain sort of intentionalism within the scope of their\ntheory as well. In doing so, however, it is unclear what remains of\nthe original character model, with its reliance on \npublicly-identifiable aspects of the context as the primary driver of\nthe rules of reference.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting some clear divisions among these options. First,\nthere is a divide between views according to which referential terms\nthemselves refer, and that we thus use them to refer because they\nalready do so, and views according to which it is us who do\nthe referring, with token linguistic reference following only\nderivatively. The causal theory and certain non-classical versions of\ndescriptivism are paradigm instances of the former sort of view,\nwhereas the intentionalist model is a paradigm instance of the \nlatter\u2014along with the classical descriptivism of Frege and Russell.\nDue to its inherent flexibility, the character model is harder to\nplace along this spectrum. Kaplan\u2019s rules for the true indexicals seem\nto straddle this divide: indexical tokens acquire their reference\nbecause they are uttered in a particular context, presumably\nintentionally. But they acquire their reference independently of\nanything having to do with the speaker\u2019s mental state. If we extend the character\ntheory to include both intention-dependent characters for\ndemonstratives and constant, context-invariant characters for names,\nthen things become more complicated still. In that case, the character\ntheory starts to look pluralistic with respect to this division; some\nreferential terms acquire their reference in virtue of our using them\nto refer, whereas we use other such terms to refer in virtue of their\nantecedently referring.\n\nA second important divide has to do with the extent to which reference\nis allowed to depend on potentially idiosyncratic and relatively\ninaccessible aspects of the speaker\u2019s mental state. As we saw above,\nboth classical descriptivists and intentionalists allow for a strong\ndependence on the speaker\u2019s mental states, and this can lead to some\nodd predictions regarding reference. Griceans and constraint-type\ntheorists like Reimer have offered ways of trying to minimize these\nresults, but one might also worry that allowing reference to depend on\nthe speaker\u2019s mental state at all undercuts our ability to explain how\nwe use referential terms to coordinate our object-directed thoughts\nwith each other\u2014in other words, to communicate. On the causal\nmodel, for instance, we literally give each other ways of thinking\nabout the same object by passing on a name. That makes explaining\ncommunication rather straightforward, supposing, that is, that we are\nconsistently able to recognize which name has been uttered on a given\noccasion. The problem of names with multiple bearers means that this\nmight turn out to be non-trivial; but at least the payoff looks\nsignificant. Alternatively, on the Kaplanian theory of true\nindexicals, we can explain our ability to coordinate our thought on\nparticular places, times, and individuals in virtue of the fact that\nthe place, time, and speaker of the utterance are things that are\ntypically public knowledge, equally available to every member of the\nconversation. The question is whether such an analysis is available\nfor terms like the impure indexicals.\n\nThird, and finally, there is an important divide between models of\nreference which are expansive as opposed to narrow.\nIn their broadest forms, both intentionalism and descriptivism are\nexpansive; they purport to apply equally well to any sort of\nreferential term whatsoever. The causal model is a narrow model of\nreference; it has only ever been purported to apply to the reference\nof names. Once more, the character model proves difficult to place;\njust how broad or narrow it proves will depend on just how far we are\nwilling to stray in our theorizing from the paradigm case of the true\nindexicals. Expansive theories hold out the promise of offering a\nsubstantive account of the reference relation. That is, expansive\ntheorists can claim that the reason that token uses of referential\nterms play a certain sort of role in explaining the the truth or \nfalsity of an utterance is that a\ncertain sort of substantive relation obtains between that token use\nand some object in the world. Narrow theorists, in contrast, will have\nto allow that there are different sorts of relations that serve to fix\nreference for different sorts of referential terms, and even perhaps\ndifferent uses of the same term. Thus, they will have to say that what\nunifies referential terms is not that, when they succeed in referring,\na particular sort of relation obtains between that token use and some\nobject or individual, but rather that they play some particular\nfunctional role in determining the truth-conditions or assertive\ncontent of an utterance. In other words, standing behind debates over\nwhich of these models we should adopt is a much larger, and as yet\nunresolved, question: just what are our explanatory ambitions in\noffering a theory of reference in the first place?\n",
