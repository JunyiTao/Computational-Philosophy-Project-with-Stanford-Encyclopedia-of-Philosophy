    "main_text": "Multi-Modal Systems in Philosophical Discussions || Abductive Reasoning\n5.1 Abductive Reasoning\n\nThe term\n abduction\n has been used in related but sometimes different senses. Roughly\nspeaking, abductive reasoning (also called [or closely connected to\nconcepts as] inference to the best explanation,\nretroduction, and hypothetical, adductive\nor presumptive reasoning, among many other terms) can be\nunderstood as the process through which an agent (or a group\nof them) looks for an explanation of a surprising observation. Many\nforms of intellectual tasks, such as medical and fault diagnosis,\nlegal reasoning, natural language understanding, and (last but not\nleast) scientific discovery, belong to this category, thus making\nabduction one of the most important reasoning processes.\n\nIn its simplest form, abduction can best be described with\n Peirce\u2019s\n 1903 schema (Hartshorne & Weiss 1934: CP 5.189):\n\n\n\nThe surprising fact, C, is observed.\n\nBut if A were\ntrue, C would be a matter of course.\n\nHence, there is reason to suspect that A is\ntrue.\n\n\n\nThis is the understanding that has been most frequently cited and used\nwhen providing formal approaches to abductive reasoning. Still,\ntypical definitions of an abductive problem and its solution(s) have\nbeen given in terms of a (propositional, first-order) theory and a\nformula, leaving the attitudes of the involved agents out of the\npicture.\n\nHowever, there have been also proposals that formalize (parts of) the\nabductive process in terms of diverse epistemic concepts (e.g.,\nLevesque 1989; Boutilier & Becher 1995). Among them,\nVel\u00e1zquez-Quesada, Soler-Toscano, &\nNepomuceno-Fern\u00e1ndez (2013) understand abductive reasoning as a\nprocess of belief change that is triggered by an observation and\nguided by the knowledge the agent has. In symbols\n(Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada 2015), abductive reasoning from a surprising\nobservation \\(\\psi\\) to a belief \\(\\varphi\\) can be described as\n\n\\[\nK(\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow [\\psi{!}](K\\psi \\rightarrow \\langle\\varphi\\Uparrow\\rangle B\\varphi,\n\\]\n\n\nstating thus that if the agent knows \\(\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi\\) and\nan announcement of \\(\\psi\\) (\u201c\\([\\psi{!}]\\)\u201d) makes her\nknow it \\((\\psi)\\), then she can perform an act of belief\nrevision with \\(\\varphi\\) (\u201c\\([\\varphi\\Uparrow]\\)\u201d)\nin order to believe it. This formalization emphasizes not only that\nthe agent\u2019s initial knowledge plays a crucial role in the\ngeneration of possible abductive solutions, but also that the chosen\nsolution can only be accepted in a weak way (so the agent believes it\nbut is not certain about it), therefore making it a candidate for\nbeing revised/discarded in the light of further information.\n\nOther proposals have incorporated further aspects into the picture.\nOne of them, Ma & Pietarinen (2016), follows Peirce\u2019s latter\nunderstanding of abductive reasoning (called then\nretroduction: \u201cgiven a (surprising) fact C, if\nA implies C, then it is to be inquired whether A\nplausibly holds\u201d; Peirce 1967: 856) as a form of reasoning from\nsurprise to inquiry. This can be connected to the notions of\nissues and questions described in\n section 4.3.\n As the authors mention, \n\n\n[t]he important discovery is that [, in the new formulation,] the\nconclusion is presented in a kind of interrogative mood. But the\ninterrogative mood does not merely mean that a question is raised. In\nfact, it means that the possible conjecture A becomes the\nsubject of inquiry: the purpose is to determine whether that A\nis indeed plausible or not. Peirce termed such mood \u201cthe\ninvestigand mood\u201d. Hence abduction can be viewed as the dynamic\nprocess toward a plausible conjecture and, ultimately, toward a\nlimited set of the most plausible conjectures.\n\n",
