    "main_text": "The Ends of Forgiveness\n3. The Ends of Forgiveness\n\nEven if reconciliation is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nforgiveness, we can still recognize that reconciliation is, as Robert\nRoberts (1995) puts it, the \u201cteleology of forgiveness\u201d.\nAll things being equal, reconciliation is the goal to which\nforgiveness points. Although there are reasons that sometimes make\nreconciliation impossible or unwise, forgiveness is oriented towards\npromoting pro-sociality and friendly relations (McCullough 2008: 114,\n116). In some cases, this might mean that the end of forgiveness is to\nrepair a relationship to its ex ante state. In some cases,\nhowever, only partial reconciliation may occur. In such cases, the\nnature of the restored relationship should be \u201cappropriate to\nthe situation of the parties after they have forgiven one\nanother\u201d (Bash 2007: 25).\n\nCommon conceptions of forgiveness make clear that its main purpose is\nthe re-establishment or resumption of a relationship ruptured by\nwrongdoing. In keeping with the common conceptions of forgiveness,\nmany contemporary philosophers argue that the resumption of\nrelationships disrupted by wrongdoing often requires a moral\nreassessment of the wrongdoer by the victim, and that such a\nreassessment involves relinquishing resentment or some other form of\nmorally inflected anger (Murphy & Hampton 1988; Murphy 2001), or\nbehavior such as seeking revenge (Griswold 2007; Zaibert 2009; Govier\n2002; Hughes 2016).\n\nMaintaining or perpetuating personal relationships is one of the\nclearest and most important ends of forgiveness, though not the only\nimportant one. Forgiving those who wrong us often helps us move beyond\nstrong negative emotions which, if allowed to fester, could harm us\npsychologically and physically. Forgiveness benefits wrongdoers, as\nwell, by releasing them from the blame and hard feelings often\ndirected toward them by those they wrong, or helping them transcend\nthe guilt or remorse they suffer from having done wrong, thereby\nallowing them to move forward in their lives. These ends of\nforgiveness may be regarded as in general enabling in the sense that\nthey show how forgiveness sometimes helps people move beyond the\nwrongs they endure or cause and the sometimes debilitating effects\nthose wrongs have on wrongdoers and victims alike. For some,\nforgiveness has these forward-looking benefits because of the way it\ntransfigures the past. Emmanuel Levinas claims that \u201cforgiveness\nacts upon the past, somehow repeats the event, purifying it\u201d\n([1961] 1969: 283), a notion similar to Hannah Arendt\u2019s view\nthat forgiveness alters the ethical significance of a\nwrongdoer\u2019s past by keeping it from having a permanent or fixed\ncharacter (Arendt 1958).\n",
