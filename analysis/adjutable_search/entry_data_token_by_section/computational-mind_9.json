    "main_text": "Neural networks || Computational neuroscience\n4.4 Computational neuroscience\n Computational neuroscience describes the nervous system\nthrough computational models. Although this research program is\ngrounded in mathematical modeling of individual neurons, the\ndistinctive focus of computational neuroscience is systems of\ninterconnected neurons. Computational neuroscience usually models\nthese systems as neural networks. In that sense, it is a variant,\noff-shoot, or descendant of connectionism. However, most computational\nneuroscientists do not self-identify as connectionists. There are\nseveral differences between connectionism and computational\nneuroscience:\n\n Neural networks employed by computational neuroscientists are\nmuch more biologically realistic than those employed by\nconnectionists. The computational neuroscience literature is filled\nwith talk about firing rates, action potentials, tuning curves,\netc. These notions play at best a limited role in connectionist\nresearch, such as most of the research canvassed in (Rogers and\nMcClelland 2014).\n Computational neuroscience is driven in large measure by\nknowledge about the brain, and it assigns huge importance to\nneurophysiological data (e.g., cell recordings).  Connectionists place\nmuch less emphasis upon such data. Their research is primarily driven\nby behavioral data (although more recent connectionist writings cite\nneurophysiological data with somewhat greater frequency).\n Computational neuroscientists usually regard individual nodes in\nneural networks as idealized descriptions of actual\nneurons. Connectionists usually instead regard nodes\nas neuron-like processing units (Rogers and McClelland 2014)\nwhile remaining neutral about how exactly these units map onto actual\nneurophysiological entities.\n\nOne might say that computational neuroscience is concerned mainly\nwith neural computation (computation by systems of neurons),\nwhereas connectionism is concerned mainly with abstract computational\nmodels inspired by neural computation. But the boundaries\nbetween connectionism and computational neuroscience are admittedly\nsomewhat porous. For an overview of computational neuroscience, see\nTrappenberg (2010) or Miller (2018).\nSerious philosophical engagement with neuroscience dates back at\nleast to Patricia Churchland\u2019s Neurophilosophy\n(1986). As computational neuroscience matured, Churchland became one\nof its main philosophical champions (Churchland, Koch, and Sejnowski\n1990; Churchland and Sejnowski 1992). She was joined by Paul\nChurchland (1995, 2007) and others (Eliasmith 2013; Eliasmith and\nAnderson 2003; Piccinini and Bahar 2013; Piccinini and Shagrir\n2014). All these authors hold that theorizing about mental computation\nshould begin with the brain, not with Turing machines or other\ninappropriate tools drawn from logic and computer science. They also\nhold that neural network modeling should strive for greater biological\nrealism than connectionist models typically attain. Chris Eliasmith\n(2013) develops this neurocomputational viewpoint through\nthe Neural Engineering Framework, which supplements\ncomputational neuroscience with tools drawn from control theory\n(Brogan 1990). He aims to \u201creverse engineer\u201d the brain,\nbuilding large-scale, biologically plausible neural network models of\ncognitive phenomena.\nComputational neuroscience differs in a crucial respect from CCTM\nand connectionism: it abandons multiply realizability. Computational\nneuroscientists cite specific neurophysiological properties and\nprocesses, so their models do not apply equally well to (say) a\nsufficiently different silicon-based creature. Thus, computational\nneuroscience sacrifices a key feature that originally attracted\nphilosophers to CTM. Computational neuroscientists will respond that\nthis sacrifice is worth the resultant insight into neurophysiological\nunderpinnings. But many computationalists worry that, by focusing too\nmuch on neural underpinnings, we risk losing sight of the cognitive\nforest for the neuronal trees. Neurophysiological details are\nimportant, but don\u2019t we also need an additional abstract level\nof computational description that prescinds from such details?\nGallistel and King (2009) argue that a myopic fixation upon what we\ncurrently know about the brain has led computational neuroscience to\nshortchange core cognitive phenomena such as navigation, spatial and\ntemporal learning, and so on. Similarly, Edelman (2014) complains that\nthe Neural Engineering Framework substitutes a blizzard of\nneurophysiological details for satisfying psychological\nexplanations.\n\nPartly in response to such worries, some researchers propose an\nintegrated cognitive computational neuroscience that connects\npsychological theories with neural implementation mechanisms\n(Naselaris et al. 2018; Kriegeskorte and Douglas 2018). The basic idea\nis to use neural network models to illuminate how mental processes are\ninstantiated in the brain, thereby grounding multiply realizable\ncognitive description in the neurophysiological. A good example is\nrecent work on neural implementation of Bayesian inference (e.g.,\nPouget et al. 2013; Orhan and Ma 2017; Aitchison and Lengyel\n2016). Researchers articulate (multiply realizable) Bayesian models of\nvarious mental processes; they construct biologically plausible neural\nnetworks that execute or approximately execute the posited Bayesian\ncomputations; and they evaluate how well these neural network models\nfit with neurophysiological data.\nDespite the differences between connectionism and computational\nneuroscience, these two movements raise many similar issues. In\nparticular, the dialectic from \u00a74.4\nregarding systematicity and productivity arises in similar form.\n",
