    "main_text": "Birthing the Word and Being in the World: Eckhart\u2019s Mystagogical Ethics || Learning to Let Go: Negative Virtue and Non-Attachment\n9.3 \u201cFruitful Virginity\u201d: Being in the World and the Christian Life\n\nImportantly, however, although becoming appropriately\nabgescheiden, gel\u0203zen, and entbildet\ncan be the ladder one climbs up to eventually throw away for a life of\nunity in, with, and through participation in the \u201cwayless\nway\u201d of the divine life of the Trinity\u2014this\n\u201cvirginal\u201d conception of the Word in the soul liberated\nfrom attachment to the world is not the end of the story. So\nlong as we remain embodied created beings, we are always beings\nin the world (even if we are no longer of it). The\n\u201cletting-go\u201d involved in true spiritual poverty is itself\na negatio negationis\u2014a turning of nothingness\n\u201cfrom a simple negation of creation into a way of being in the\nworld\u201d (Howells 2010: 38). Put in the terms of Sermon 2, the\n\u201cvirginal\u201d soul must also \u201cbear fruit\u201d and be\na \u201cwife\u201d. It is not enough to be merely\n\u201cpregnant\u201d with the divine logos, the soul must\nalso continually \u201cbirth\u201d the Word in itself, such that God\ncan work through the soul and thereby bring it to a \u201cdeeper mode\nof participation in the truth and goodness of all things\u201d (Milne\n2016: 107). For this reason, even if Eckhart\u2019s selective focus\non negative virtues like releasement and detachment, together with his\nrepeated warnings that God cannot be sought in ways or by technical\nmeans, might make one question whether Eckhart\u2019s thought can\nreally be considered to contain any sort of normative ethical\nforce, there is nevertheless a role for the traditional virtues and\nvirtuous moral action to play in his conception of the good life.\n\nFirst, Eckhart seems to think that it is better for us to be created\nas we are than to have always rested in God and perfect self-awareness\n(Milne 2016: 101). Like the \u201cnobleman\u201d in the parable of\nthe ten pounds (Luke 19:12), who \u201cwent to a distant region to\nreceive royal power for himself\u201d and (on Eckhart\u2019s\nreading) returned home wealthier, our lives, too, are richer for\nhaving \u201cflowed out of God\u2019s will\u201d into creaturely\nbodies endowed with reason and having experienced the moral and\nepistemic struggle involved in our return to the Creator (Pr.\n15; DW I:245; MW 270). Even the inclination to sin, Eckhart thinks, is\nitself beneficial for human beings, insofar as the \u201cperfection\nof virtue comes by struggle\u201d, and the struggle against our\nsinful inclinations \u201cmakes [us] ever more zealous to practice\nvirtue strongly\u201d (RdU n.9; DW V:213; MW 494).\n\nSecond, as part of this return, the cultivation of the traditional\nmoral and theological virtues can be a useful\u2014perhaps even\nnecessary\u2014preparation for the life of detachment and spiritual\npoverty. Indeed, Eckhart cautions that his words regarding leaving\nimages and goal-oriented actions behind are\n\n\nonly for the [already] good and perfected people, who have so absorbed\nand assimilated the essence of all virtues that these virtues emanate\nfrom them naturally, without their seeking. (Pr. 101; DW\nIV/1:354; MW 33)\n\n\nThird, and most importantly, the soul united with God in pure\ndetachment\u2014although in some sense having transcended the\nvirtues\u2014nevertheless continues to act virtuously in the world,\nthough she does not act for the sake of anything else, even of virtue\nitself (Connolly 2014: 190ff.). Rather, her will and God\u2019s will\nare a singular will, such that she acts wholly freely\nin virtue, but unbound by the constraints that even morality\nwould place on her. As Eckhart exhorts his audience, \u201cYou should\ntraverse [durchg\u00e2n] and transcend all the virtues,\ndrawing virtue solely from its source in that ground where it is one\nwith the divine nature\u201d (Pr. 16b; DW I:276; MW 117; cf.\nalso TP 278). When this happens, Eckhart thinks, \u201call virtues\nshould be enclosed in you and flow out of you in their true being\n[wesenl\u00eeche von dir vliezen]\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nIt is with this in mind that Eckhart turns the Mary and Martha story\non its head in Sermon 86 (Pr. 86; DW III:481\u2013503; MW\n83\u201390), claiming that it is not Mary, sitting enraptured at the\nfeet of Christ, who represents the moral and spiritual exemplar.\nRather, this role is played by Martha, who busily tends to the guests\nand the housework, being \u201cso well grounded in her essence that\nher activity was no hindrance to her\u201d. Although Mary has\ncorrectly grasped what is most valuable and worthy of\nworship\u2014and therefore begun her journey of spiritual\nprogress\u2014according to Eckhart, we might suspect that she\nnevertheless \u201csat there a little more for her own happiness than\nfor spiritual profit\u201d. Martha, on the other hand, is\n\u201cunhindered\u201d insofar as all her works are \u201cguided by\nthe eternal light\u201d. In contrast to her contemplative sister, who\nis just beginning her \u201cschooling\u201d in \u201clearning how\nto live\u201d, the experienced and busy Martha has already progressed\nto being \u201cwith things and not in them\u201d. Eckhart concludes\nthe sermon by noting that \u201csome people hope to reach a point [of\nspiritual progress] where they are free of works\u201d, but that\n\u201cthis cannot be\u201d (Pr. 86; DW III:492; MW 89). In\nthis sense, then, there is ultimately no distinction for Eckhart\nbetween the vita activa and the vita\ncontemplativa:\n\n\nIt is actually the same thing, for we take only from the same ground\nof contemplation and make it fruitful in works, and thus the object of\ncontemplation is achieved. (Pr. 104; DW IV/1:580; MW 48)\n\n\nIndeed, as has been shown repeatedly throughout this entry,\nEckhart\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the Word\u201d attempts to bring\nthese two strands together with the help of an intellectualist\nmetaphysics that places divine thought and speech\u2014the eternal\nlogos and ewig wort\u2014at its (silent and still)\ncore.\n",
