    "main_text": "New Relativism || General Objections to New Relativism\n5.6 General Objections to New Relativism\nWe turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all its forms. The first is an argument from assertion, the second an argument from simplicity.\n5.6.1 Relativism and assertion\nTwo assertion-related objections to New Relativism arise from work by Gareth Evans (1985) and Robert Stalnaker (1978), respectively. Greenough (2010: 2) concisely captures Evans\u2019s challenge to truth-relativism on assertoric grounds as follows:\n\n(1)\nThe question \u201cWhat should [an assertor] aim at?\u201d is a legitimate question.\n(2)\nAny legitimate answer to this question will generate a once-and-for-all answer.\n(3)\nAny once-and-for-all answer is incompatible with Truth-Relativism\n(4)\nTherefore, Truth Relativism is ruled out.\n\nThe relativist must plausibly take issue with (2) or (3), (or both). For an attempt to meet Evans\u2019 challenge, MacFarlane has defended a way to effectively reject (2) via what Marques has called a \u201cmeet-the-challenge\u201d norm of assertion (cf. MacFarlane 2003; though see also his 2014: ch. 5; cf., Stanley 2016: 181\u20132)\u2014according to which (\u00e0 la Brandom 1983), in asserting p one undertakes a commitment to either defending p or giving up p if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily (see K\u00f6lbel (2004: 308) for some other discussions of this objection).\nA related assertion-based challenge to truth-relativism emerges by appeal to Stalnaker\u2019s (1978) belief transfer model of assertion (cf. 2011). The idea here is to appeal to a plausible view of the purpose of assertion\u2014to \u201ctransfer beliefs from assertor to members of her audience\u201d (Egan 2007: 15) and then to object that what is asserted, according to the truth-relativist, cannot play this characteristic role; specifically, this will be because, for the truth-relativist, the asserted contents are liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to the audience. For instance, Sam hardly (on the truth-relativist\u2019s program) seems to \u201ctransfer\u201d to Dean his belief Apples are tasty (which is true) by asserting this to Dean, when what Dean comes to believe Apples are tasty is something (on the assumption that Dean doesn\u2019t like apples) that will be false. Thus, and more generally, it\u2019s not clear what, exactly, could be said to be transferred and a fortiori asserted. See Egan (2007) and Dinges (2017) for attempts to reconcile truth-relativism (about epistemic modals) with Stalnaker\u2019s belief-transfer model of assertion.\n5.6.2 Simplicity\nCappelen and Hawthorne (2009) assess the merits of New Relativism as it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of the objects of thought and talk, \u201cSimplicity\u201d, the core tenets of which are:\n\n(T1)\nThere are propositions and they instantiate the fundamental monadic properties of truth simpliciter and falsity simpliciter.\n(T2)\nThe semantic values of declarative sentences relative to contexts of utterance are propositions.\n(T3)\nPropositions are, unsurprisingly, the objects of propositional attitudes, such as belief, hope, wish, doubt.\n(T4)\nPropositions are the objects of illocutionary acts; they are, e.g., what we assert and deny.\n(T5)\nPropositions are the objects of agreement and disagreement. (Cappelen & Hawthorne 2009: 1)\n\nCappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism (what they call analytic relativism) as a direct challenge to (T1) and that, if this challenge were successful, it would consequently bring down the more general picture they call \u201csimplicity\u201d (cf., Ferrari & Wright 2017). Accordingly, Cappelen and Hawthorne\u2019s central objective is to show that truth-relativist\u2019s arguments aimed at undermining (T1) are ultimately unsuccessful; more specifically, their broad strategy is to insist that the arguments adduced in favor of truth-relativism\u2014when thoroughly understood\u2014constitute a presumptive case for contextualism (in the domains where relativism was defended, and in particular, in the domain of predicates of personal taste).\n6. Conclusion\nRelativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves grounded in disparate philosophical motivations. There is no such thing as Relativism simpliciter, and no single argument that would establish or refute every relativistic position that has been proposed. Despite this diversity, however, there are commonalities and family resemblances that justify the use of the label \u201crelativism\u201d for the various views we have discussed. Relativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various attempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse. What is most surprising, however, is the recent popularity of some versions of the doctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy.",
