    "main_text": "The Zero-Force Evolutionary Law\n8. The Zero-Force Evolutionary Law\n\nMany paleobiologists have assumed that driven trends must be driven by\nnatural selection. For example, if body size increase is driven,\nsurely that means that larger body size has conferred some survival or\nreproductive advantage (Hone & Benton 2005). McShea (2005) and\nMcShea and Brandon (2010) have forcefully challenged that assumption.\nMcShea (2005) argues that increase in structural complexity is a\ndriven trend, but one that need not be driven by selection. That is\nbecause increasing structural complexity might just be the zero-force\ncondition for evolving systems, an idea that McShea and Brandon (2010)\ndevelop in great detail. McShea and Brandon\u2019s zero-force\nevolutionary law\u2014or ZFEL\u2014has elicited critical\nresponses from other philosophers (Barrett, et al. 2012). Whereas\ntraditional evolutionary thinkers, from Darwin on down, assumed that\nnatural selection would have to explain complexity increase, McShea\nand Brandon see complexity increase as the default expectation, and\nthey invoke selection to explain deviations from that default\nexpectation\u2014such as cases of eye loss in cave-dwelling species.\nThey treat eye loss in cave dwellers as a case where natural selection\nfavors a reduction in structural complexity. Alternatively,\nO\u2019Malley, Wideman, & Ruiz-Trillo (2016) consider the\npotentially wide-ranging and macroevolutionary role of simplification\nin conferring \u201cadaptive\u201d advantage.\n\nMcShea and Brandon also argue that the ZFEL has the virtue of\ngiving a unified account of both micro- and macro-evolutionary\nphenomena. They invoke the ZFEL to explain a wide variety of\ndifferent patterns, ranging from complexity increase in the history of\nanimal life, as represented by the fossil record, to increasing\ngenomic heterogeneity over time. Whatever one thinks about their claim\nthat the ZFEL is \u201cbiology\u2019s first law\u201d,\ntheir project raises a question worth exploring: is it reasonable to\nthink that explanations of macroevolutionary patterns should take\nfundamentally the same form as explanations of patterns at vastly\ndifferent spatiotemporal scales? How much does scale matter?\n\nThe ZFEL also raises some fundamental philosophical questions\nabout the structure of evolutionary theory. How, for example, should\nwe determine what counts as the default expectation, or zero-force\ncondition, for an evolutionary system (Gouv\u00eaa 2015)? Is there\nany way to distinguish empirically between theories that disagree\nabout the default expectation? Is there even a fact of the matter\nabout what the default expectation should be? These questions about\ndefault expectations for evolutionary systems may link up with larger\nquestions about the function of null hypotheses in scientific\nreasoning. These questions about default assumptions in\nmacroevolutionary theory also prompt comparison with questions about,\nfor instance, neutral theory in molecular evolution (Kimura 1983) and\nin community ecology (Hubbell 2006). For relevant philosophical\ndiscussion, see e.g., Dietrich (1994); Bausman and Halina (2018).\n",
