    "main_text": "The Case for Organ Sale || Consistency\n2.3 Consistency\n\n\nMany authors have pointed out that there appears to be no\nfundamental difference between selling organs and other widely accepted\npractices, particularly selling one's own \u2018risky\nlabour\u2019 (work that involves a risk of harm that is the same as or\ngreater than that involved in organ donation) (Harris 1992;\nBrecher 1990, 1994; Wilkinson & Garrard 1996).\nFurthermore, common forms of \u2018risky labour\u2019 (coal mining,\ndeep-sea diving, fire fighting, military service in a just war, etc.)\nare often more dangerous than selling a kidney, but are\nregarded as heroic, rather than condemned; it is seen as just and\nproper to reward those who do these things. This difference in\nattitude cannot be justified in terms of the good consequences that\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 produces, since the consequences of an organ\nsale (often, saving a life) may be just as good or better.\nTherefore, it is inconsistent to allow people to be paid for\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 while not allowing them to be paid for their\norgans. Savulescu (2003, 138) makes the point as follows:\n\n\nIf we should be allowed to sell our labour, why not sell the means to\nthat labour? If we should be allowed to risk damaging our body\nfor pleasure (by smoking or skiing), why not for money which we will\nuse to realise other goods in life? \u2026 or consider the diver. He\ntakes on a job as a deep sea diver which pays him an extra $30,000\n\u2026 This loading is paid because the job has higher risks to\nhis life and health. He takes the job because he likes holidays in\nexpensive exotic locations.\n\nSimilarly, Fabre (2006, 131) argues that:\n\n\nIf someone's interest in raising income by engaging in very risky\nactivities, such as being a full-time boxer or a building-site worker,\nis deemed important enough to confer on her the right to do so\n\u2026 there is no reason to deny her the right to make parts of her body\navailable to others in exchange for money, even though she would incur\nsimilar risks in doing so.\n\nRecently, some scholars have questioned whether organ sale and\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 are as similar as they might appear to be.\nMalmqvist (2015), for example, argues that it is not clear that kidney\nsales and dangerous jobs really do involve comparable risks, all\nthings considered.\n",
