Early bibliographies list a text bearing his name, but all that\nremains of it are quotations in other works; the original has been\nlost. It is thus difficult to date this material.\n\nShen\u2019s central insight seems to have been that government should\nbe based not on feudal principles, but on a bureaucratic system. Creel\nobserves that Shen favored \u201ca system of administration by means\nof professional functionaries, whose functions are more or less\ndefinitely prescribed\u201d (SBH p. 55). Rulers should not find good\nmen and give them responsibility, but instead find the right man for\neach role in the system. The role of the ruler in such a theory is\nsimple: define the needed functions and select men to perform them,\nthen \u201cdo nothing (wuwei)\u201d. Doing nothing does not\nmean to literally abstain from action, but the ruler does nothing more\nthan keep the system running smoothly. Shen compares the ruler to a\nscale:\n\n\n\u2026 which merely establishes equilibrium, itself doing nothing;\nyet the mere fact that it remains in balance causes lightness and\nheaviness to discover themselves. (SBH p. 352)\n\n\nUnlike the Dao De Jing, which seems to trust nature more than\nman, Shen Buhai trusts man-made institutions more than\nindividuals\u2019 decision-making powers.\n",
