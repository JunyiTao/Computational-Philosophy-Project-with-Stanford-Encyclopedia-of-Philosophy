    "main_text": "The transcendental deduction || Self-consciousness\n4.1 Self-consciousness\n\nOne way to approach Kant\u2019s argument is to contrast his view of\nself-consciousness with two alternative views that he rejects. Each of\nthese views, both Kant\u2019s and those he rejects, can be seen as\noffering competing answers the question: what is the source of our\nsense of an ongoing and invariable self that persists throughout all\nthe changes in our experience?\n\nThe first answer to this question that Kant rejects is that\nself-consciousness arises from some particular content being present\nin each of one\u2019s representations. This material conception of\nself-consciousness, as we may call it, is suggested by Locke\u2019s\naccount of personal identity. According to Locke, \u201cit being the\nsame consciousness that makes a Man be himself to himself, personal\nIdentity depends on that only, whether it be annexed only to one\nindividual Substance, or can be continued in a succession of several\nSubstances\u201d (Essay 2.27.10). What Locke calls\n\u201cthe same consciousness\u201d may be understood as some\nrepresentational content that is always present in my experience and\nthat both identifies any experience as mine and gives me a sense of a\ncontinuous self by virtue of its continual presence in my experience.\nOne problem with this view, Kant believes, is that there is no such\nrepresentational content that is invariably present in experience, so\nthe sense of an ongoing self cannot possibly arise from that\nnon-existent content (what Locke calls \u201cconsciousness\u201d)\nbeing present in each of one\u2019s representations. In Kant\u2019s\nwords, self-consciousness \u201cdoes not yet come about by my\naccompanying each representation with consciousness, but rather by my\nadding one representation to the other and being conscious of their\nsynthesis. Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of\ngiven representations in one consciousness that it is possible for me\nto represent the identity of the consciousness in these\nrepresentations\u201d (B133). Here Kant claims, against the Lockean\nview, that self-consciousness arises from combining (or synthesizing)\nrepresentations with one another regardless of their content. In\nshort, Kant has a formal conception of self-consciousness rather than\na material one. Since no particular content of my experience is\ninvariable, self-consciousness must derive from my experience having\nan invariable form or structure, and consciousness of the identity of\nmyself through all of my changing experiences must consist in\nawareness of the formal unity and law-governed regularity of my\nexperience. The continuous form of my experience is the necessary\ncorrelate for my sense of a continuous self.\n\nThere are at least two possible versions of the formal conception of\nself-consciousness: a realist and an idealist version. On the realist\nversion, nature itself is law-governed and we become self-conscious by\nattending to its law-governed regularities, which also makes this an\nempiricist view of self-consciousness. The idea of an identical self\nthat persists throughout all of our experience, on this view, arises\nfrom the law-governed regularity of nature, and our representations\nexhibit order and regularity because reality itself is ordered and\nregular. Kant rejects this realist view and embraces a conception of\nself-consciousness that is both formal and idealist. According to\nKant, the formal structure of our experience, its unity and\nlaw-governed regularity, is an achievement of our cognitive faculties\nrather than a property of reality in itself. Our experience has a\nconstant form because our mind constructs experience in a law-governed\nway. So self-consciousness, for Kant, consists in awareness of the\nmind\u2019s law-governed activity of synthesizing or combining\nsensible data to construct a unified experience. As he expresses it,\n\u201cthis unity of consciousness would be impossible if in the\ncognition of the manifold the mind could not become conscious of the\nidentity of the function by means of which this manifold is\nsynthetically combined into one cognition\u201d (A108).\n\nKant argues for this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,\nand against the formal realist view, on the grounds that \u201cwe can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves\u201d (B130). In other words, even if reality\nin itself were law-governed, its laws could not simply migrate over to\nour mind or imprint themselves on us while our mind is entirely\npassive. We must exercise an active capacity to represent the world as\ncombined or ordered in a law-governed way, because otherwise we could\nnot represent the world as law-governed even if it were law-governed\nin itself. Moreover, this capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed must be a priori because it is a condition of\nself-consciousness, and we would already have to be self-conscious in\norder to learn from our experience that there are law-governed\nregularities in the world. So it is necessary for self-consciousness\nthat we exercise an a priori capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed. But this would also be sufficient for self-consciousness\nif we could exercise our a priori capacity to represent the world as\nlaw-governed even if reality in itself were not law-governed. In that\ncase, the realist and empiricist conception of self-consciousness\nwould be false, and the formal idealist view would be true.\n\nKant\u2019s confidence that no empiricist account could possibly\nexplain self-consciousness may be based on his assumption that the\nsense of self each of us has, the thought of oneself as identical\nthroughout all of one\u2019s changing experiences, involves necessity\nand universality, which on his view are the hallmarks of the a priori.\nThis assumption is reflected in what we may call Kant\u2019s\nprinciple of apperception: \u201cThe I think must be\nable to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something\nwould be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is\nas much as to say that the representation would either be impossible\nor else at least would be nothing for me\u201d\n (B131\u2013132).[15]\n Notice the claims about necessity and universality embodied in the\nwords \u201cmust\u201d and \u201call\u201d here. Kant is saying\nthat for a representation to count as mine, it must necessarily be\naccessible to conscious awareness in some (perhaps indirect) way: I\nmust be able to accompany it with \u201cI think\u2026.\u201d All\nof my representations must be accessible to consciousness in this way\n(but they need not actually be conscious), because again that is\nsimply what makes a representation count as mine. Self-consciousness\nfor Kant therefore involves a priori knowledge about the necessary and\nuniversal truth expressed in this principle of apperception, and a\npriori knowledge cannot be based on experience.\n\nKant may have developed this thread of his argument in the\ntranscendental deduction after reading Johann Nicolaus Tetens\n(1736\u20131807) rather than through a direct encounter with\nLocke\u2019s texts (Tetens 1777, Kitcher 2011). On the subject of\nself-consciousness, Tetens was a follower of Locke and also engaged\nwith Hume\u2019s arguments for rejecting a continuing self. So\nKant\u2019s actual opponents in the deduction may have been Lockean\nand Humean positions as represented by Tetens, as well as rationalist\nviews that Kant would have encountered directly in texts by Leibniz,\nWolff, and some of their followers.\n",
