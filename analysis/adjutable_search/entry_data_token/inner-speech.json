Specific\nquestions about inner speech that have exercised philosophers include\nits similarities to, and differences from, outer speech; its\nrelationship to reasoning and conceptual thought; its broader\ncognitive roles\u2014especially within metacognition and\nself-knowledge; and the role it can play in explanations of auditory\nverbal hallucinations and \u201cthought insertion\u201d.\n\nA more formal characterization of inner speech (yet one that still\naims at theoretical neutrality) is to say that inner speech is a\nmental phenomenon that is both keyed to a natural language and often\navailable to introspection. To say that inner speech is\n\u201cavailable to introspection\u201d is to say that each person\nhas an introspective way of knowing about their own inner speech\nepisodes that others lack (Schwitzgebel 2010 [2019]); our access to\nour own inner speech is\u2014at least often\u2014comparable to our\naccess to others of our conscious mental episodes. To say that inner\nspeech is \u201ckeyed to\u201d a natural language is to say that it\neither occurs in a natural language (like words spoken aloud) or\nrepresents words of a natural language (like an audio recording of a\nspeech), or that it does both. In specifying that the language in\nquestion is a \u201cnatural\u201d language, we mean to include any\nlanguage one may acquire through learning\u2014such as English,\nJapanese, or American Sign Language\u2014and to exclude any innate\nmental languages that may exist (such as a Fodorian [1975]\nMentalese, or other innate \u201clanguage of\nthought\u201d). This characterization leaves open several questions\nof controversy including: (1) whether all inner speech is\navailable to introspection; (2) whether inner speech is literally a\nform of speech, a form of thought, or both, or neither; and (3)\nwhether inner speech occurs in a natural language, or represents items\nof a natural language, or both.\n\nInner speech is a subject of study in many distinct disciplines,\nincluding neuroscience, speech pathology, developmental psychology,\npsychiatry, computer science, and linguistics, as well as philosophy.\nFor this reason, there are a variety of distinct theoretical tools and\nconcepts one might use to describe its nature and cognitive roles,\nwith correspondingly distinct aims, methods, and literatures. We focus\nhere on the accounts contemporary philosophers have given of its\nnature and on the explanatory purposes to which inner speech is most\ncommonly put in philosophical work. Nevertheless, much of the\ncontemporary philosophical work on inner speech is itself\ninterdisciplinary in nature and aims to be consistent with, and\ninformed by, results in allied disciplines, including, especially,\nexperimental psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. We discuss\nthose sources where relevant to the issues that have exercised\nphilosophers, while directing readers most interested in the empirical\nwork to other reviews, such as Alderson-Day & Fernyhough (2015),\nLangland-Hassan (2021), and Perrone-Bertolotti et al. (2014). For\nanother philosophically-oriented review, see Vicente &\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique (2011). Also, we focus on inner speech linked\nto the auditory modality, as opposed to inner speech that may occur in\na gestural or visual modality (as may be the case with gestural sign\nlanguages), because nearly all of the existing research on inner\nspeech concerns a phenomenon that is in some way linked to\naudition.\n\nFinally, the phenomenon of speaking to oneself audibly is\nusually referred to as \u201cprivate speech\u201d. Some parts of the\ndiscussion in this entry are easily transferable to private speech,\ne.g., the matter of whether we can perform speech acts in inner\nspeech. Others are not. For example, the question of whether inner\nspeech, as a mental phenomenon, is actually a kind of speech has no\ncounterpart in the context of private speech, as private speech is\nuncontroversially a kind of speech. It is typically easy to determine\nwhether a question about inner speech also applies to private speech,\nso we will not comment on this further.\n", "toc": [{"#InneSpeeActuSpee": "1.

Inner Speech as Actual Speech\n\nThe auditory-sensory character of inner speech is usually thought to\nbe due to its involvement of auditory-verbal imagery (for an\nexception, see O\u2019Brien 2013). Mental images (in any modality)\nare generally viewed as representations of particular things (or kinds\nof thing), not instances of those things. A visual image of a duck,\nfor example, is a representation of a duck, not an actual duck.\nLikewise, it may seem that inner speech, insofar as it involves\nauditory imagery, is a representation of speech (and of its sounds, in\nparticular), not actual speech. \u201cGrass is green\u201d, produced\nin inner speech, would then represent an utterance of the sentence,\n\u201cGrass is green\u201d, but it would not actually be an\nutterance of that sentence.\n\nNotwithstanding this, many philosophers working on inner speech hold\nthat inner speech really is a kind of speech. When we produce inner\nspeech, we are literally speaking, albeit silently. We will call this\nview the \u201cactual speech view\u201d. Proponents include\nCarruthers (1996), Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2010,\n2015), Gauker (2011, 2018), O\u2019Brien (2013), Jorba & Vicente\n(2014), Gerrans (2015), Gregory (2016, 2018) (though Gregory has\nindicated in more recent work (e.g., Gregory forthcoming) that he no\nlonger holds the view), Machery (2018), Wilkinson & Fernyhough\n(2018), Wilkinson (2020), and Frankfort (2022).\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente argued for the view in their\n2010 paper; their 2015 paper, discussed in\n Section 3.3.2,\n sets out an updated version of their theory which incorporates some\nfurther commitments. Historically, the view can be traced at least to\nthe Soviet psychologist, Lev Vygotsky (1934 [1986]), and it was also\nheld by Ryle (1949 [2009]). However, Gauker develops a somewhat\ndifferent version of the view\u2014one that sharply distinguishes\ninner speech from the auditory-verbal imagery typically associated\nwith it (see\n Section 3.2\n for discussion)\u2014which has its origins in Sellars (1956).\n\nIf inner speech is a kind of speech, instances of inner speech could\naptly be called \u201cinner speech utterances\u201d, as producing\ninner speech would really amount to saying something. However, in\norder to be neutral on the issue, we will use the term, \u201cinner\nspeech episodes\u201d, in this section and throughout the entry. An\nimportant issue for a proponent of the actual speech view is to\nexplain how inner speech can consist of genuine linguistic tokens,\ngiven that it seems to be an imagistic phenomenon\u2014where, as\nnoted, the images may appear to be representations of speech sounds.\nFor, even if inner speech consists of images of speech sounds, this\nonly suggests that it consists of representations of\nlinguistic items, not linguistic items themselves.\n\nOne style of answer has been offered by Sam Wilkinson (2020), who\ndraws a distinction between imagery and imagination. He holds that\nsensory imagining is a \u201cpersonal-level phenomenon\u201d, which\nhas components (2020: 16). One of the components of sensory imagining\n(as opposed to propositional or \u201cattitudinal\u201d imagining,\nwhich is typically assumed to be non-imagistic in nature) is mental\nimagery. For example, if one sensorily imagines a duck, then one\ncomponent of this personal-level mental state may be a mental image\nresembling the appearance of a duck. There might also be other\ncomponents, such as a stipulation that the image is an image of a duck\nand not another bird of similar appearance. But, Wilkinson emphasizes,\nmental imagery can be involved in many personal-level mental attitudes\napart from the attitude of imagining, such as remembering, judging,\nreasoning, and others. \u201cIn a similar way\u201d, he claims,\n\n\nimagery \u2026 may be involved in an inner assertion. That does not,\nhowever, make the inner assertion simply nothing more than the imagery\ninvolved in its production, still less an act of imagination. (2020:\n16).\n\n\nImagery can play many roles, Wilkinson is saying, and there is no\nreason that one of those roles should not be as a medium for\nlinguistic tokens. The inner assertion is \u201ca genuine\nassertion\u201d\u2014an instance of language consisting of\nimagery.\n\nIt might be replied that, although imagery can play a role in many\npersonal-level mental states apart from imagining, it plays a very\nsimilar role in all of them, viz., representing how a concrete object\n(whether actual or possible) appears or sounds. Mental imagery does\nnot tend to play a role similar to that of a linguistic token. So,\neven if mental imagery is involved in a range of personal-level mental\nstates, it is not obviously well-suited, in the case of inner speech,\nto play the specific role of actual linguistic tokens.\n\nThis challenge might be met by connecting the actual speech view with\nwork on the metaphysics of word tokens, as proposed by Wade Munroe\n(2022a, 2023). Munroe holds that\n\n\nwhat makes something, \u03c6, a token of a word type,\nw, is that the process of generating \u03c6 is\nexplained and guided by one\u2019s (tacit) knowledge of w\n(or the morphological structure of w), e.g., one\u2019s\nsemantic, syntactic, morphophonological/orthographic, knowledge of w\nstored in one\u2019s mental lexicon. (2022a: 4)\n\n\nThis allows him to hold that inner speech episodes can involve word\ntokens, insofar as their generation is guided by the relevant kind of\ntacit knowledge. (Though Munroe himself does not hold the actual\nspeech view; see\n Section 3.3.1\n for discussion of his view.) Relatedly, J. T. M. Miller (2021)\nexplicitly denies that word tokens are necessarily substances and\nholds, instead,\n\n\nthat particular or token words are objects, which are bundles of\nvarious sorts (most notably semantic, phonetic, orthographic, and\ngrammatical) properties. [sic] (2021: 5737)\n\n\nOne might hold that inner speech episodes in fact consist in such\nbundles.\n\nAlthough the matter of how inner speech episodes can involve genuine\nlinguistic tokens is of great importance for the actual speech view,\nit is only beginning to receive attention. However, several arguments\nhave been given in support of the theory generally. These include the\nfollowing:\n\nInner speech may be a developmental descendant of a kind of\nexternal speech. Piaget (1923 [1926/1959]) observed that young\nchildren have a practice of speaking to themselves aloud. He described\nthis kind of speech as \u201cegocentric speech\u201d (ibid, passim)\n(egocentric speech can be seen as one kind of private speech; see\nIntroduction). Vygotsky (1934 [1986]) presented empirical evidence\nthat inner speech develops in children as they internalize the\npractice of producing egocentric speech (though see Gregory\n(forthcoming) questioning this evidence). Vygotsky held that\negocentric speech becomes silent, inner speech, but that it does not\nchange in its fundamental nature, so it remains a kind of actual\nspeech (see also Wilkinson & Fernyhough (2018), Wilkinson\n(2020)).\nIntrospectively, it seems like we can perform speech\nacts\u2014e.g., make assertions and ask questions\u2014in inner\nspeech. But it would only be possible to perform speech acts in inner\nspeech if inner speech is a kind of speech (Wilkinson 2020; Wilkinson\n& Fernyhough 2018). (This issue is addressed further in\n Section 4.1.)\nOn the face of it, we produce inner speech for purposes such as\nfocusing our attention, motivating ourselves, and evaluating our\nactions. These correspond to purposes which instances of external\nspeech also often serve: focusing the attention of others, motivating\nthem, and commenting on their actions. There are also parallels in\nterms of how inner speech episodes and instances of external speech\nare constructed. Both often take the form of short, sub-sentential\nitems when this is sufficient (e.g., \u201cHere!\u201d, upon finding\nsomething which was lost) and more fully elaborated sentences when\nthis is necessary (e.g., when carefully listing the considerations\nrelevant to a difficult decision which needs to be made, whether by\noneself or by a group). Marta Jorba, Agust\u00edn Vicente, and\nFernando Mart\u00ednez-Manrique have taken these systematic\nparallels as evidence that inner speech and external speech are simply\ndifferent types of one phenomenon, namely, speech (Jorba & Vicente\n2014; Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2015).\nThere seems to be a contrast between imagining speaking and\nengaging in inner speech, as it is ordinarily understood. This\ncontrast, Gregory (2016) suggests, parallels the contrast between two\nkinds of external actions which we can perform. When an actor says the\nlines in their script, what they are producing is a representation of\nspeech that someone else might produce. The actor is, of course,\nspeaking, but they are doing so in the context of a pretense. What the\nactor is doing contrasts with the speech which they produce in, e.g.,\nan ordinary conversation with someone. The contrast between imagining\nspeaking and producing inner speech seems to map neatly onto the\ncontrast between what the actor does on the stage and what they do in\nan ordinary conversation. If this is so, then a natural analysis is\nthat the contrast between imagined speech and inner speech is a\ncontrast between a representation of speech and actual\nspeech\u2014which implies that inner speech is a kind of actual\nspeech.\n\n\nA couple of philosophers who hold the actual speech view but express\nit in different terms, or who hold very similar positions, should be\nmentioned. First, Philip Gerrans (2015) describes inner speech as\ninvolving \u201cimaginary action\u201d (2015: 296), but he is\nexplicit that, by this, he means only to say that producing inner\nspeech is an action performed covertly. He takes inner speech to\ninvolve speaking, but doing so silently.\n\nSecond, Johannes Roessler (2016) holds that there are different kinds\nof inner speech, one of which involves imagining speaking (rather than\nactually speaking), but in a particular way. He points out that we can\nimagine things, or imagine doing things, for different purposes. An\nact of imagining will then be successful to the extent that it\nachieves the purpose for which it is performed. So, one might, for\nexample, imagine making an assertion, but do so with the intention of\nimagining making an assertion which is true and relevant to context.\nThen the act of imagining making the assertion \u201cincurs the same\nliabilities\u201d (2016: 548) that the act of actually making the\nassertion would incur. If you are puzzling over some question, and you\nimagine asserting a possible answer, then the act of imagining will be\nsuccessful only if you have imagined asserting the correct answer.\nAlthough you have only imagined performing the speech act of making an\nassertion, your imagined assertion will be \u201cin some ways\ntantamount to an assertion\u201d (2016: 548).\n\nIt would be an open position, though not one Roessler takes, that all\ninner speech episodes could be analyzed in this way. On such a view,\ninner speech episodes would be something very similar to actual\nspeech, yet without quite being speech acts, and thus without the\ncommitment that producing inner speech involves producing actual\nlinguistic items.\n2. Inner Speech and Thought\n\nA second question about inner speech is how it relates to thought. It\nseems that there must be some relationship, but it is an open\nquestion what that relationship is. In general, there are three views\nabout the nature of the relationship: (1) inner speech episodes\nexpress thoughts; (2) inner speech episodes\nfacilitate thoughts; and (3) inner speech episodes (at least\nsometimes) are thoughts of a certain kind.\n\nThe views are not mutually exclusive: one can certainly hold that\ninner speech is related to thought in multiple ways.\n2.1 Inner Speech and Thought Expression\n\nLangland-Hassan & Vicente (2018b: 10) observe that the view that\ninner speech (at least often) expresses thoughts that are distinct\nfrom the inner speech episodes themselves coheres with some larger\ntheories about thought and language. If one is attracted to these\ntheories, then they may well also be attracted to the view that inner\nspeech merely expresses thought.\n\nFirst, there is a natural connection between the language of thought\nhypothesis, most closely associated with Jerry Fodor (1975), and the\nview that inner speech expresses thought. On the language of thought\nhypothesis, our thoughts do take place in a language, but not in a\nnatural language. Rather, our thoughts take place in a kind of mental\nlanguage, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d. If the\nlanguage of thought hypothesis is true, then, insofar as inner speech\nis keyed to a natural language, it seems that inner speech can at most\nserve to express the thoughts which occur in the mental language.\n\nSecond, on Willem Levelt\u2019s influential theory about language\nproduction, speaking involves conveying a pre-existing\n\u201cmessage\u201d (1989: passim). The structure of this message is\nconceptual but not linguistic. Via several stages of processing,\nnatural language sentences (or sub-sentential items) are formulated\nwhich, once articulated, express the conceptually structured message\nwith which the process started. If one thinks that inner speech is\nactually a kind of speech, then one might incline to think that inner\nspeech also expresses a pre-existing message.\n\nThus, Peter Carruthers (2009, 2018) approaches matters from a Fodorian\nand Leveltian angle when he proposes that\n\n\nthe first metacognitive access subjects have to the fact that they\nhave a particular belief is via its verbal expression (whether overtly\nor in inner speech). (2009: 125)\n\n\nFor Carruthers, the inner speech episode is not a belief or judgment\nitself, but rather the expression thereof (see\n Section 5.2).\n In a similar way, Ray Jackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011, 2012) emphasizes\nthe distinction between thought itself and the auditory imagery by\nwhich it may be expressed, identifying only the latter with inner\nspeech (see\n Section 3.1).\n Likewise, Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (2003) and Jesse Prinz\n(2011) distinguish between conceptual thought itself and inner speech,\nwhile holding that we often come to know what we are thinking by\nattending to inner speech sentences that we might use to express such\nthoughts. They stop short of explicitly claiming that such sentences\nactually express thoughts, however, specifying instead that the inner\nepisodes are sentences through which such thoughts \u201cmight be\nexpressed\u201d (Berm\u00fadez 2003: 164), or that we \u201cwould\nuse\u201d to express them (Prinz 2011: 186) (see\n Section 5.1).\n\nOne can, however, hold that inner speech episodes express thoughts\nwithout committing to the view that a thought must be fully-formed\nprior to the production of the relevant inner speech episode.\nJos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (2018), for example, holds that\nproducing an inner speech episode can actually play a role in forming\nthe thought which it expresses. For Berm\u00fadez, a thought can be\nrefined and precisified as an external utterance is being produced\nand, equally, a thought can be refined and precisified while an inner\nspeech episode is being produced. Nonetheless, by the time an inner\nspeech episode has been produced, it will express an existing\nthought.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the following point of contact between the\nactual speech view, discussed in\n Section 1,\n and the question of whether inner speech expresses thought. If it is\nan essential feature of speech that it serves to express thought, then\ndefenders of the actual speech view are likewise committed to the view\nthat inner speech expresses thought. If, on the other hand, one holds\nthat there can be (inner) speech that does not express thought, then\nthe question arises as to what the difference between (inner) speaking\nand thinking in a natural language might be\u2014and whether there is\nindeed a difference.\n2.2 Inner Speech and Thought Facilitation\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to how inner speech might play\na substantive role in facilitating thought or thought\nprocesses\u2014a role that goes beyond merely expressing thought\nprocesses.\n\nFirst, inner speech is often thought to play an important role in\nworking memory. According to Alan Baddeley\u2019s influential theory\nof working memory (e.g., Baddeley 1992), we can retain a series of\nwords or numbers in working memory by reciting them in inner speech. A\nshort series of items will be retained long enough to recite them\nagain. One can iterate this process via a \u201cphonological\nloop\u201d for as long as desired.\n\nFollowing Vygotsky (1934 [1986]), Clowes (2007) and Jorba &\nVicente (2014) hold that inner speech can serve as a tool for\ndirecting our own attention, just as external speech can serve as a\ntool to direct the attention of others. In making this case, both draw\non the Vygotskyan developmental account of inner speech, on which\ninner speech is derived from the external phenomenon. See also\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015), who make the same point\nbut are less directly influenced by Vygotsky\u2019s original (1934\n[1986]) developmental account.\n\nThere is evidence that inner speech facilitates various executive\nfunction tasks, such as planning, task-switching, and inhibiting\nimpulsive and inappropriate responses, without being essential to\nthem. The evidence that inner speech can play a role in these tasks is\nprimarily empirical. For reviews of the relevant literature, see\nAlderson-Day & Fernyhough (2015) and Petrolini, Jorba, &\nVicente (2020).\n\nMunroe (2022b; forthcoming) argues that inner speech plays a role in\nreasoning which goes beyond merely aiding or improving it. He notes\nthat reasoning processes often involve preserving representations in\nworking memory. In doing complex mental arithmetic, for example, one\nmight recite in inner speech the word for a number which they have\ndetermined will be needed later in the process, e.g., when regrouping\nvalues (i.e., \u201ccarrying\u201d and \u201cborrowing\u201d). The\nnumber word will be stored in working memory via the process described\nabove. But, on Baddeley\u2019s model of working memory, which Munroe\nis working with, only sensory representations can be stored in working\nmemory. In the present context, this means that only auditory\nrepresentations of the relevant word sounds can be stored, not the\nconceptual content which the word would have if spoken aloud (or,\npossibly, if it were produced in inner speech in a different context,\ndepending on one\u2019s view on the contents of inner\nspeech\u2014see\n Section 3).\n When one needs to use the number at a later stage in the process,\nthey will need to interpret the sensory representation which they are\nproducing. For example, if they are reciting a sound corresponding to\nthe word, \u201csix\u201d, in inner speech, they will need to\ninterpret that as the word referring to the number, six, so that six\nbecomes the number that they now use to continue their calculations.\nIf this is so, then interpreting the inner speech that one was\nproducing, and thus the inner speech itself, was essential to the\nreasoning process, not merely a dispensable aid. Munroe holds that the\nsame will apply in many reasoning processes performed that require\nmaking use of an intermediate conclusion.\n\nA number of theorists\u2014especially those working in neo-empiricist\n(Barsalou 1999; Prinz 2011, 2012) and embodied cognition traditions\n(Borghi et al. 2017; Dove 2014)\u2014have also proposed that inner\nspeech plays an important role in facilitating abstract thought, i.e.,\nthought about objects or properties that are not easily perceived.\nHere the idea is that language perception and production\nabilities\u2014and their internalization, via inner\nspeech\u2014provide means for explaining the acquisition and use of\nabstract concepts in broadly sensorimotor terms. In particular, Guy\nDove (2014, 2018, 2020, 2022) develops a view where\nlanguage\u2014often in the form of inner speech\u2014is used as a\n\u201cscaffold\u201d or \u201ctool\u201d for enabling thought\nabout abstract entities, and where the capacity for abstract concept\nuse is closely tied to the capacity for language.\n\nFinally, if subsystems and modules in the mind function in isolation\nfrom one another to any significant extent, then inner speech may play\nan important role in integrating their output. Carruthers (2002, 2006)\nsuggests that the process of language production generally, including\nthe production of inner speech, is especially well suited to integrate\nthe output of multiple modules, because of the combinatorial nature of\nlanguage. In producing an episode of inner speech, one can thus\nexpress complex content, which is then distributed to mental modules\nand subsystems for further processing. Other sources relevant to inner\nspeech and the integration of information produced by different parts\nof the mind include Baars (1988) and Dennett (1991).\n2.3 Inner Speech as Thought\n\nA number of philosophers have argued that at least some inner speech\nepisodes actually are thoughts or, at least, parts of thought\nprocesses. Gauker (2011, 2018) holds that all conceptual thought\noccurs in inner speech, where, as elaborated in\n Section 3.2,\n he takes inner speech to involve the tokening of items of a natural\nlanguage in neural states that are distinct from the auditory-verbal\nrepresentations that many identify with inner speech. In his 2011\nbook, he responds to arguments that conceptual thought cannot occur in\nnatural language.\n\nWith respect to inner speech understood as a partly sensory\nphenomenon, Keith Frankish (2018) describes how inner speech can be\nused to break a complicated problem into smaller problems, which can\nthen be addressed by lower level, automatic thought processes.\nDeciding whether to accept an invitation from colleagues to attend a\nparty, for example, one might produce the inner speech episode,\n\u201cWhat will it be like?\u201d. This more circumscribed question\ncan be addressed by autonomous processes, such as recalling previous\nparties with colleagues. Along with other autonomous processes, this\nmight generate the prediction that an annoying colleague, Henry, will\nlikely be at the party. If this is significant, it could result in the\ninner speech episode, \u201cHenry will probably be there\u201d, in\nturn prompting a largely autonomous evaluation of the effort involved\nin enduring Henry\u2019s company. The process could result, depending\non the outcome of this evaluation, in producing the inner speech\nepisode, \u201cI can\u2019t face that; I won\u2019t go\u201d.\n(Quotes from Frankish [2018: 234], though the example is slightly\nmodified.) The inner speech episodes, Frankish believes, are critical\nto making the decision, and are thus rightly considered parts of the\nprocess of thinking itself. See Kompa (forthcoming) for a similar\nargument; cf. Munroe (2022b), discussed above, who also holds that an\ninner speech episode can be essential to a thought process but does\nnot infer from this that an inner speech episode can actually be a\npart of the process, but see also discussion of Munroe (2023)\nbelow.\n\nFrankish (2018) also holds that inner speech episodes can be thoughts\nin the form of conscious commitments, where these are \u201ca\ndistinct kind of mental attitude\u201d (2018: 237), which cannot be\nanalyzed in terms of other conscious mental states, such as conscious\ndecisions, beliefs, or desires, or expressions of other mental states.\nThey are simply commitments made to oneself to \u201cregulat[e] our\nfuture activities, including our intentional reasoning, in line with\nthe choice or view expressed\u201d (2018: 237). For example, the\ninner speech episode, \u201cI will go to the gym today\u201d, is a\ncommitment to go to the gym today, not just the expression of a\ndecision to do so, because it also generates a kind of obligation to\noneself, as it were, to do so. For Frankish, this follows from\ntreating inner speech as an internalized version of interpersonal\nspeech, in which commitments also generate obligations.\n\nOn Frankish\u2019s account, an inner speech episode can be\nlike a judgment, insofar as it may involve committing oneself\nto act and reason in a way which is consistent with the truth of the\nproposition expressed by the inner speech episode. Munroe (2023), by\ncontrast, holds that an inner speech episode can actually function as\na judgment. If an inner speech episode is accompanied by what has been\ncalled a \u201cFeeling of Rightness\u201d (Munroe cites Thomson et\nal. 2013 and Unkelbach & Greifender 2013), then it will play roles\ntypically attributed to judgments such as \u201cterminating inquiry\nand causing overt actions\u201d (Munroe 2023: 309). Munroe connects\nhis claim to a model proposed by Ackerman & Thompson (2015, 2017a,\n2017b) on which the roles that mental states play is determined partly\nby metacognitive monitoring. The \u201cFeeling of Rightness\u201d is\na cue to a metacognitive monitoring system that a particular mental\nstate can appropriately play the roles of a judgment. Munroe\u2019s\nclaim is that inner speech episodes can function as judgments if this\nis deemed appropriate by the metacognitive monitoring system, on\naccount of being accompanied by the appropriate \u201cFeeling of\nRightness\u201d (or at least by a feeling of sufficient\ncertainty).\n\nNikola Kompa (forthcoming) adds a quite different argument for the\nidentity of (some) thoughts and (some) inner speech episodes. She\noperates with a broad notion of inner speech, on which any\n\u201cinner episode that substantially engages the speech production\nsystem\u201d is an instance of inner speech (forthcoming: 4, emphasis\nremoved). On this understanding of inner speech, any thought with\nsemantic content and syntactic structure will be an instance of inner\nspeech, even if it does not become conscious. Kompa rejects the\nlanguage of thought hypothesis, on which thoughts can have linguistic\nproperties because they occur in a non-natural language. Accordingly,\nfor Kompa, the only way that a thought can have semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure is if its formation substantially\ninvolves the speech production system (which she understands in\nLeveltian terms, citing Levelt 1989; Levelt et al. 1999; and Indefrey\n& Levelt 2004). Insofar as we have any thoughts that have semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure, then, these are, on her definition,\ninstances of inner speech. If the production of such thoughts does not\nproceed further through the speech production process, such that they\nare morpho-phonologically encoded in addition to having semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure, they will occur as unconscious inner\nspeech episodes.\n\nFinally, it has been suggested that there is a close connection\nbetween inner speech and a phenomenon known as \u201cunsymbolized\nthought\u201d. Using the Descriptive Experience Sampling paradigm,\nRussell Hurlburt and Christopher Heavey (e.g., Hurlburt & Heavey\n2002; Heavey & Hurlburt 2008) have gathered introspective data\nthat they interpret as providing evidence that people sometimes have\nthe experience of\n\n\nthinking a particular, definite thought without the awareness of that\nthought\u2019s being conveyed in words, images, or any other symbols.\n(Heavey & Hurlburt 2008: 802)\n\n\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015), Vicente &\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique (2016), and Vicente & Jorba (2019)\nsuggest that these \u201cunsymbolized thoughts\u201d occur when the\nproduction of an inner speech episode is aborted at the earliest stage\nof production, when only the content or message to be expressed has\nbeen formulated. Appealing to accounts on which we experience\nconscious representations of actions which we begin to perform but\nabort, they suggest that an unsymbolized thought is a representation\nof the message which one commenced expressing in inner speech, which\nbecomes conscious because the process was aborted. Insofar as the\nprocess was aborted prior to the message being organized in phonetic\nform, the representation is entirely amodal. See also Kompa\n(forthcoming).\n3. Content-Based Theories of Inner Speech\n\nWe have seen that there are a variety of views taken on whether inner\nspeech is indeed a kind of speech, or a kind of thought, or both. A\npopular way to gain added leverage on those questions is to advance an\naccount of the contents of inner speech. Focusing on questions\nconcerning the contents of inner speech also helps to clarify the\ndepth of some of the puzzles and controversies already introduced.\n\nMost generally, the content of a representation is what the\nrepresentation is of or about\u2014it is what the\nrepresentation represents. The content of the word \u201ccat\u201d\nis a certain type of animal (namely, a cat). And, the content of the\nsentence \u201ccats are animals\u201d is the proposition that cats\nare animals. Two distinct representations can have the same content.\nFor instance, the French word \u201cchat\u201d has the same content\nas the English word \u201ccat\u201d; and the French sentence\n\u201cles chats sont des animaux\u201d has the same content as the\nEnglish sentence \u201ccats are animals\u201d. Thus\u2014to borrow\nanalogies from Siegel (2005 [2021])\u2014the contents of a mental\nstate, in the present sense, are akin to the contents of a newspaper\narticle and not akin to the contents of a bucket. Mental contents are\nnot things that are contained within mental states themselves (just as\ncats are not contained within the word \u201ccat\u201d) but are,\ninstead, what the mental states are of or about.\n\nWe will distinguish three broad classes of views about the contents of\ninner speech and several sub-views within them, noting their main\nmotivations and relationships to questions concerning inner\nspeech\u2019s proposed cognitive roles. According to what we will\ncall the \u201cphonological content view\u201d, inner speech\nepisodes always and only have phonological contents. The\ncompeting content-based theories to be discussed hold either that\ninner speech only has semantic contents (the \u201csemantic content\nview\u201d, as we will call it) or that inner speech has phonological\ncontents and semantic and/or other kinds of contents (the\n\u201cmixed contents view\u201d).\n\nAs we will see, the phonological content view is a natural fit with\nthe view, discussed at the beginning of\n Section 1,\n that inner speech is merely a representation of speech and not\nactually a kind of speech. This is because the phonological content\nview sees inner speech as consisting in imagistic representations of\nspeech and as lacking the kinds of contents (or meanings) associated\nwith word tokens themselves. Likewise, those who hold that inner\nspeech is actually speech will typically hold either a mixed contents\nview or a semantic content view, as these views allow inner speech\nepisodes to have the kinds of semantic contents that are typically\nviewed as essential to being a linguistic token.\n3.1 The Phonological Content View\n\nTo say that inner speech has phonological contents is to say that\ninner speech episodes represent phonemes (or phones), where\nphonemes are the most basic meaningless building-blocks from which any\nword of a language can be built. There are 44 phonemes in English,\ndifferent combinations of which account for the distinct sound each\nword has in relation to all other words from which it can be aurally\ndistinguished. The notion of a phoneme is somewhat of an abstraction,\nhowever, as slightly different sounds (in terms of pitch, timbre, and\nfrequency) can fall within the sonic range that constitutes a single\nphoneme type. These more specific, concrete sounds that can qualify as\ninstantiations of a phoneme are known as phones. Whether\ninner speech episodes represent phonemes or, instead, the\nfiner-grained property of being a phone is a matter of\ndispute among those who hold that inner speech episodes have\nphonological contents (Patel 2021; Langland-Hassan 2018; Hill\n2022).\n\nNote also that, while the phonemes of most natural languages are\nauditory in nature\u2014and are thus perceived through the sense of\nhearing\u2014the notion of a phoneme has also been applied to\ngestural languages, such as American Sign Language (Sandler 2012;\nStokoe 2005). So, the concept of a phoneme is not specific to any\nmodality. It refers to the smallest meaningless units of a language\nthat can be arranged and recombined to form the smallest meaningful\nunits of that language, no matter which modality the language occurs\nin. In spoken languages, however, the auditory modality takes\nprecedence over the visual/written modality, insofar as the phonemes\nare typically held to be sounds, while the graphemes are held to be\nletters or groups of letters that represent phonemes. While most will\nnot consider the visualization of graphemes and written words to be\ncases of inner speech, it bears noting that such visualizations\nsatisfy the neutral characterization of inner speech provided at the\noutset.\n\nThere are several reasons one might hold that inner speech episodes\nhave phonological contents. The first is phenomenological in nature.\nWhat it is like to have an inner speech episode is similar to what it\nis like to hear oneself saying the corresponding words aloud. One\nmight explain this phenomenological similarity by appeal to the fact\nthat inner speech episodes and the corresponding cases of hearing\nrepresent similar properties\u2014either phonemes or phones of a\ncertain sort\u2014and, accordingly, have similar contents. A second\nreason appeals to the fact that we can use inner speech episodes to\njudge whether two visually dissimilar written words\u2014such as\n\u201cblood\u201d and \u201cmud\u201d\u2014rhyme. As rhyming is a\nrelationship between the sounds of words, the usefulness of inner\nspeech episodes in judging rhymes would be explained if inner speech\nepisodes represented word sounds and thereby allowed us to compare\nthose sounds (Langland-Hassan 2014). A third reason that has been\nproposed for thinking that inner speech has phonological contents is\nthat it is the representation of those features that allows one to\ndiscern which language we are exploiting when engaged in inner speech\n(Langland-Hassan 2018). (See Patel 2021 for a rebuttal.)\n\nJackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011) proposes that auditory contents exhaust\nthe contents of inner speech. Jackendoff\u2019s view is motivated in\npart by a prior commitment to the thesis that we do not think in a\nnatural language. Like many in cognitive science, he sees natural\nlanguage primarily as a means for communicating thoughts that\nthemselves occur unconsciously in some other medium (such as a\nFodorian \u201cMentalese\u201d). According to Jackendoff, thought\nitself is never conscious, nor is the use of concepts. By contrast,\ninner speech\u2014what he calls the \u201ctalking voice in the\nhead\u201d (1996: 10)\u2014occurs consciously and does not involve\nthe use of concepts. In having inner speech, he explains, \u201c[w]e\nexperience organized sounds\u201d, whereas,\n\n\nthe content of our experience, our understanding of the\nsounds, is a different organization \u2026 called conceptual\nstructure. (emphasis original, 1996: 12\u201313)\n\n\n\u201cThe organization of this content\u201d, he holds, \u201cis\ncompletely unconscious\u201d (1996: 13). Jackendoff identifies the\ninner voice with a representation of \u201cphonological\nstructure\u201d, a representation having phonological content, yet no\nconceptual or semantic content. Whereas, the mental states\nconstituting our understanding of what the voice is saying,\nhe notes, are distinct conceptual states that occur unconsciously:\n\n\nWhat we experience as our inner monologue is actually the phonological\nstructure linked to the thought,\n\n\nhe explains.\n\n\nWe are aware of our thinking because we hear the associated sounds in\nour head. (Jackendoff 2011: 613)\n\n\n(See also Jackendoff [2007: 80\u201385] where he remarks on the\ncounterintuitive nature of his view: \u201cHow can the contents of\nconsciousness consist of just a string of sounds?\u201d [2007:\n85].)\n\nIt should be noted that Jackendoff also suggests that inner speech\nepisodes \u201cexpress\u201d thoughts, which would seem to support\nthe view that such episodes have the semantic contents of our thoughts\n(e.g., \u201cthe linguistic modality can make reasons as such\navailable in consciousness\u201d [1996: 19] and \u201conly through\nlanguage can such concepts form part of experience rather\nthan just being the source of intuitive urges\u201d [1996: 23]). On\nthe other hand, he equally emphasizes the overlooked fact that\n\u201clinguistic structure has three major departments: phonological,\nsyntactic, and semantic/conceptual structure\u201d, and that\n\u201cthe forms in awareness\u2014the qualia\u2014most closely\nmirror phonological structure\u201d (2007: 81). Most recently, he has\nproposed a view where what we intuitively mark as \u201cconscious\nthought\u201d has three components: a \u201cpronunciation\u201d of\nthe thought, a feeling of meaningfulness, and the meaning attached to\nthe pronunciation. There he holds that only the first two are\nconscious and appears to identify inner speech with the\n\u201cpronunciation\u201d component. This is in keeping with the\nphonological content view, as the (semantic) meaning of the\npronunciation is something separate from the pronunciation and is only\nrepresented \u201cbackstage\u201d (i.e., unconsciously) (Jackendoff\n2012: 84\u20135).\n\nLangland-Hassan (2014) provides a qualified defense of a phonological\ncontent view, motivated by worries about how a single mental\nstate\u2014in particular an episode of inner speech\u2014can be said\nto represent both word sounds and word meanings simultaneously. He\nnotes that a word\u2019s meaning and its sound are entirely distinct\nproperties, related only by convention. If mental states are\nindividuated by their contents, then it seems that distinct neural or\nfunctional states will be needed to represent these distinct\nproperties. This has become known as the \u201cbinding problem\u201d\nfor inner speech (see Munroe 2023; Patel 2021; Berm\u00fadez 2018\nfor different approaches to resolving it; see also Prinz 2011 for\nrelated remarks). In light of this problem, Langland-Hassan proposes\nthat ordinary episodes of inner speech likely consist in two or more\nmental states triggered at roughly the same time (this would be a\nmultiple-state version of the \u201cmixed contents\u201d view,\ndiscussed below). Yet he adds that, when inner speech has been divided\ninto distinctly occurring states in this way, there are good reasons\nto identify inner speech solely with the component that represents\nword sounds. Doing so results in a phonological content view.\n3.2 The Semantic Content View\n\nIn contrast to the phonological content view, the semantic content\nview holds that inner speech episodes always and only have semantic\ncontents. By \u201csemantic contents\u201d, we mean the kinds of\ncontents had by ordinary words, phrases, and sentences of a natural\nlanguage. Such contents are typically equated with the\nmeaning of a word, phrase, or sentence.\n\nOne version of a semantic content view, defended by Christopher Gauker\n(2011, 2018), holds that inner speech episodes exclusively have\nsemantic contents and entirely lack both auditory contents and\nauditory phenomenology. Gauker allows that episodes of auditory verbal\nimagery often accompany inner speech. However, on his view, this\nauditory imagery is not to be identified with inner speech itself.\nRather, according to Gauker, inner speech is a non-sensory linguistic\nphenomenon occurring in the brain that is (often) represented\nby episodes of auditory verbal imagery. Just as we may use\nauditory representations to represent someone else\u2019s speech that\nwe are actually hearing, so too, for Gauker, our inner speech is often\nrepresented by verbal imagery\u2014imagery that is in fact distinct\nfrom the (inner) speech itself. (Here Gauker develops related remarks\nof Wilfrid Sellars (1956).) Notably, Gauker (2018) grants that, in the\ncase of inner speech, this auditory-verbal imagery\nmisrepresents our inner speech as having sonic features\n(i.e., as instantiating phones or phonemes), given that the neural\nevents that constitute inner speech episodes are themselves\nsilent.\n\nGauker\u2019s style of pure semantic content view is not widely\nendorsed. This may be because it clashes with the widespread view that\ninner speech has a sensory character similar to that of hearing\nspeech. On the other hand, Gauker\u2019s view can be said to have an\nadvantage in providing a literal sense in which, when we engage in\ninner speech, we are thinking in words of a natural language\nand not merely about them. On Gauker\u2019s (2011) view, the\nneural events that carry semantic content are themselves tokens of\nwords and phrases of a natural language, and the question of how\nauditory-verbal images can also be linguistic tokens does not arise.\nHis view is also motivated by an opposition to what he calls the\n\u201cLockean\u201d view that sees conceptual thought as something\nprior to and separate from the speech that expresses it. One can see\nGauker (2011) as trying to preserve the idea that abstract\n(conceptual) thought occurs in a language (and is often\nnon-conscious), while divorcing it from the thesis that there exists\nan innate, Fodorian \u201clanguage of thought\u201d (and one that\nmust be exploited in order to learn a natural language).\n\nBerm\u00fadez (2018) offers a different style of semantic content\nview that allows for inner speech to retain a characteristic auditory\nphenomenology. According to Berm\u00fadez, the auditory sensory\ncharacter of inner speech is a result of inner speech episodes having\nnon-representational auditory properties. For\nBerm\u00fadez, the only representational contents had by inner\nspeech episodes are those pertaining to the meanings of words. In\nresponse to the those who argue that inner speech episodes must also\nhave phonological contents (e.g., to explain why we can use inner\nspeech to judge whether two words rhyme), he argues that there is no\nentailment from the fact that inner speech episodes can be useful in\njudging rhyme relations to the conclusion that they represent phonemes\n(2018: 216\u20137).\n\nA third type of theory on which inner speech exclusively has semantic\ncontent proceeds by arguing that inner speech is a genuine form of\nspeech. This argument is typically made on either phenomenological or\nfunctional grounds. From there it is inferred that inner speech must\nhave the same kind of contents as external speech. If episodes of\nexternal speech\u2014i.e., the words we hear when someone\nspeaks\u2014have semantic content but no phonological content\n(because they do not represent phonemes), so too must\nepisodes of inner speech. This approach to theorizing about inner\nspeech is discussed in more detail in\n Section 1.\n Assuming that (unlike Gauker) proponents of such a view wish to\nmaintain that inner speech episodes constitutively have auditory\nsensory character, they may concur with Berm\u00fadez in his claim\nthat the auditory phenomenology of inner speech does not entail the\nrepresentation of auditory properties; or, alternatively, they may\nprovide some other account of why, in many instances, inner speech\nseems to represent phonemes even if it does not really do so.\n3.3 Mixed Contents Views\n\nMixed contents views hold that inner speech episodes typically have at\nleast two kinds of content\u2014phonological and\nsemantic\u2014simultaneously. On a mixed contents view, the inner\nspeech episode \u201cDogs are mammals\u201d represents both the\nsound of the sentence \u201cDogs are mammals\u201d, as uttered\naloud, and the proposition that dogs are mammals. We can distinguish\ntwo species of mixed contents view: single-state and multiple-state.\nSingle-state views hold that what we intuitively mark as a single\ninner speech episode consists in a single mental state that has both\nauditory and semantic contents. Multiple-state views hold that the\napparent unity of a single inner speech episode is in some sense\nillusory, as such episodes typically consist in the contemporaneous\noccurrence of two or more mental states, where one of the states\nrepresents phones or phonemes and another has semantic contents. (Some\nmultiple-state views hold that inner speech episodes involve\nadditional distinct states with articulatory and syntactic contents as\nwell.) As earlier noted, some phonological content views hold that\nmental states with corresponding semantic contents occur\ncontemporaneously with the representations of phonemes that are\nidentified with inner speech. These phonological content views differ\nfrom multiple-state mixed contents views in that the former identify\ninner speech solely with the state that has phonological content,\nperhaps on the grounds that it is the only sort of state of which one\nis consciously aware (this appears to be Jackendoff\u2019s\nmotivation).\n3.3.1 Single-State Mixed Contents Views\n\nCarruthers (2011, 2018) defends a single-state mixed contents view,\nproposing that inner speech involves the generation of a\nrepresentation of word sounds (i.e., phonemes) which\u2014in a\nprocess akin to what occurs in outer speech perception\u2014is then\ninterpreted by one\u2019s speech comprehension mechanisms so that a\nsemantic content can then be assigned to the represented utterance.\n(He notes that a representation of the semantic content of the\nrepresented phrase\u2014referred to as the \u201cmessage\u201d on\nLevelt\u2019s [1989] speech-production framework\u2014sometimes\nprecedes the representation of the word sounds, albeit\nnon-consciously.) Once the represented word sounds are interpreted,\nCarruthers suggests, the information that the represented utterance\nhas a certain semantic content is \u201cbound into\u201d a single\n\u201cevent-file\u201d that contains information both about the\nsound and the meaning of the represented utterance (2018:\n41\u201342). (See Frankish [2004: 57; 2018] for a similar view.)\nCarruthers analogizes such binding to the way in which the color,\nshape, and category properties of a visually perceived object are said\nto be \u201cbound into\u201d a single object-file that accumulates\nmultiple forms of information about a single object, despite those\nproperties being represented in temporally distinct stages and in\ndistinct neural regions. These event-files, when activated and\nglobally-broadcast, are said to constitute a single conscious inner\nspeech episode that has both auditory and semantic contents.\n\nMunroe (2023) develops a similar style of single-state mixed contents\nview, arguing that, in addition to representing phonemic and semantic\nfeatures, inner speech episodes also represent the likelihood that the\ncontent of the represented utterance is true. The latter is necessary,\nhe holds, for inner speech episodes to qualify as judgments (see\n Section 2.3).\n These three distinct features are, for Munroe, bound into a single\nmental state in the sense that a single mental state predicates these\nthree distinct properties of a single represented utterance (Munroe\n2023: 304).\n3.3.2 Multiple-State Mixed Contents Views\n\nOther mixed contents views of inner speech\u2014inspired by\nLevelt\u2019s (1989) multi-stage model of speech\nproduction\u2014attribute the different representational contents\nentertained during an inner speech episode to multiple distinct states\nthat tend to co-occur. Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015)\ndefend a multiple-state view under the moniker of the \u201cactivity\nview\u201d of inner speech, highlighting the multi-component\nprocesses of both inner and outer speech. \u201cIt is quite\nnatural\u201d, they explain,\n\n\nto try to understand inner speech in terms of all the representations\nthat are mobilized in speech, i.e., semantic, syntactic, maybe\narticulatory \u2026. The representations involved\u2014from\nconceptual to phonological\u2014form an integrated system. (2015:\n8)\n\n\nThe view which Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente set out in their\n2015 paper bears clear similarities to the actual speech view, insofar\nas they hold that inner speech is functionally similar to external\nspeech. What separates it from the actual speech view, however, is\nthat they do not hold that inner speech consists of actual words and\nsentences which express semantic content, but of distinct\nrepresentations of phonological and semantic (and other) content. (For\ncomplementary multiple-state mixed contents views in cognitive\nneuroscience, see Grandchamp et al. 2019 and L\u0153venbruck et al.\n2018.) While these representations are unified in the sense of\noccurring within a single system for language production, they remain\ndistinct mental states\u2014distinguished, in part, by their distinct\ncontents, and their ability to occur in isolation of each other.\n(Note, however, that this way of categorizing the view assumes that\neach mental state is composed of exactly one mental representation. It\nmay be possible to articulate a view where one mental state is\ncomposed of multiple mental representations. The question then\nbecomes: in virtue of what do the multiple representations qualify as\na single mental state, as opposed to components or stages of a single\ncognitive system?)\n\nChristopher Hill (2022: 136\u2013139) develops a similar\nmultiple-state mixed content view, emphasizing that the\nrepresentations of semantic content lack any associated phenomenology.\nThe phenomenology of inner speech is, for Hill, entirely a function of\nits auditory-phonological contents. He further specifies that these\nphonological contents are (the more abstract) phonemes, and not\nphones, to account for the relatively impoverished sensory character\nof inner speech in comparison with speech perception. Patel (2021)\nalso defends a multiple-state mixed contents view, on which, in\naddition to having some combination of semantic, syntactic, auditory,\nand articulatory contents, inner speech episodes have vocal contents.\nTo have vocal contents is to represent some particular person\u2019s\nvoice as communicating some combination of semantic, syntactic,\nauditory, or articulatory information. According to Patel, whether we\nare representing the semantic, auditory, or articulatory contents,\nthese mental events involve one\u2019s representing a certain\nperson\u2019s voice as attempting to convey such information. This\ncommon representation of a voice, he argues, provides a kind of unity\nto the class of mental events that can be considered inner speech.\n\nBecause multiple-state views allow that the distinct components of\ninner speech can potentially occur in isolation, they face a question\nof which components need to occur for the episode to be properly\ncounted as an instance of inner speech. Vicente & Jorba (2019),\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015), and Vicente &\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique (2016) see this as an advantage, insofar as\nit allows them to place different phenomena related to inner speech on\na single continuum (see also Kompa & Mueller forthcoming and\nMcCarthy-Jones & Fernyhough 2011). For instance, when the semantic\nand syntactic contents of ordinary inner speech are represented in the\nabsence of any auditory-phonological contents, they propose, this can\nbe understood as a case of so-called \u201cunsymbolized\nthought\u201d (Heavey & Hurlburt 2008; Heavey, Moynihan, et al.\n2019). See\n Section 2.3\n for further detail.\n\nA notable feature of the surveyed mixed contents views (as well as the\nphonological content view) is that they need not (and often do not)\nhold that inner speech episodes occur in a natural language. Rather,\non these views, inner speech episodes represent natural\nlanguage utterances (in virtue of their phonological contents),\nwithout necessarily being instances of such utterances themselves.\nThis is because, on mixed contents views, the semantic content of an\ninner speech episode may not be represented by tokens of a natural\nlanguage. For instance, for Carruthers, the semantic contents of an\ninner speech episode are represented via symbols of an amodal language\nof thought (e.g., a Fodorian [1975] Mentalese), which are\ncoupled with sensory representations of the sound of the corresponding\nsentence as spoken aloud. One language (Mentalese) is used to\nrepresent the meaning of an expression in another (e.g., English). In\nthis way, Carruthers (2010, 2018) deviates from Carruthers (1996),\nwith the latter defending the idea that inner speech episodes\nliterally occur in\u2014and are expressions of\u2014a natural\nlanguage. Carruthers now emphasizes the point, raised also by Machery\n(2005), that introspection does not provide grounds for claims about\nthe representational format of our inner speech episodes.\n4. Inner Speech and Pragmatics\n\nIn general, the philosophy of language has focused primarily on\nlanguage used interpersonally. It is natural to wonder to what extent\nthis material is applicable to inner speech. This question can be\nasked whether or not one thinks that inner speech is actually a kind\nof speech, as no one denies that there is some interesting\nrelationship between inner speech and interpersonal speech.\n4.1 Inner Speech and Speech Acts\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n the intuition that we can perform speech acts in inner speech is the\nbasis of an argument that inner speech is a kind of speech. There are\ndifferent ways, however, that we might understand the claim, depending\non how one thinks of speech acts.\n\nOn the traditional analysis of Austin (1962) and Searle (1969),\nperforming a speech act is inherently something one does in accordance\nwith conventions tacitly understood by both speaker and listener. For\nexample, for Searle, asserting p involves (approximately)\nundertaking to someone that p is true, where the speaker does\nnot know that the listener already knows that p is true. The\nreason that an assertion can be effective is precisely that both\nspeaker and hearer understand that this is the nature of the\ntransaction. It is hard to see how this kind of analysis could apply\nto inner speech. One would need to explain how one individual can have\ntwo distinct roles, as speaker and listener, such that the conventions\nthat make interpersonal language-use possible can have any relevance\n(see Gregory 2017, 2020a for related discussion).\n\nNot every version of speech act theory, however, emphasizes\nconventions. Drawing on some ideas from Strawson (1964) and Bach &\nHarnish (1970), though not adopting their theories in whole, Wilkinson\n(2020) holds that what is essential to speech acts is that they\nexpress particular mental states. An assertion, for example, is simply\nan utterance which expresses a belief; a question is an utterance\nwhich expresses a desire to acquire certain information; etc. On this\nview, understanding someone else\u2019s utterance is simply a matter\nof grasping its content and knowing what kind of mental state the\nrelevant type of utterance expresses. Setting aside the question of\nwhether one needs to interpret their own inner speech, it may be that\ninner speech episodes can be speech acts if one thinks of speech acts\nmerely as expressions of particular mental states, rather than as\nactions which depend on conventions in the way that Austin and Searle\nsuggest. For another analysis of inner speech in terms of speech act\ntheory, see Geurts (2018), who emphasizes that inner speech episodes\ncan operate to generate commitments in a way characteristic of speech\nacts; see also Frankish (2018) and Fern\u00e1ndez Castro (2019).\n\nAn issue which sits just behind the question of whether inner speech\nepisodes are speech acts is whether they are actions at all. Gregory\n(2020b) argues that, in the vast majority of cases, inner speech\nepisodes are not actions, because we cannot give reasons for them\n(which is the criterion for actionhood on Davidson\u2019s (1963)\ncausal theory); they are not subject to our control (the criterion on\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s [1978] guidance theory); and we do not try to\nproduce them (the criterion on O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s [1973]\ntheory and Hornsby\u2019s [1980] theory). If inner speech episodes\nare not actions, then they cannot be speech acts.\n\nTom Frankfort (2022) takes the opposite view. He observes that a great\ndeal of inner speech is involved in deliberation, where this is an\nexpansive category including \u201creflecting, reasoning,\nconsidering, evaluating\u201d (2022: 52). He then applies\nMele\u2019s (2009) distinction between actions which involve\n\u201ctrying to bring it about that one x-s\u201d (Mele\n2009: 18) and actions which are done in order to bring it about that\none x\u2019s. Frankfort suggests that deliberating is an\naction in the first sense, insofar as it involves (for example) trying\nto make a decision, and inner speech episodes are actions in the\nsecond sense, insofar as they are produced in order to bring it about\nthat one deliberates successfully and (for example) comes to a\ndecision.\n\nJorba (forthcoming) also holds that inner speech episodes are\ntypically actions, applying affordance theory. Affordances are\nopportunities for actions suggested by things in one\u2019s\nenvironment. For example, an apple has the affordance of being edible;\na cup has the affordance of being graspable. Some hold that\naffordances can also be things which suggest mental actions\n(Jorba cites McClelland 2020 and Jorba 2020). Jorba\u2019s suggestion\nis that some mental states afford the production of inner speech\nepisodes. For example, an inchoate thought affords being articulated\nclearly in inner speech, and an emotion can afford being labeled.\nInsofar as inner speech episodes are produced in response to\naffordances, they are actions and, specifically, speech acts. See\nBar-On & Ochs (2018) for another account on which inner speech\nepisodes can be \u201cacts of innerly speaking our mind\u201d (2018:\n19, emphasis removed).\n4.2 Inner Speech and Conversation\n\nClosely related to the question of whether there can be speech acts in\ninner speech is the question of whether inner speech can involve a\nkind of dialogue or conversation. A theory which characterizes inner\nspeech this way has been developed at length in psychology, primarily\nby Charles Fernyhough (e.g., 1996, 2008, 2009). However, the\nsuggestion has been made in a variety of ways by philosophers as well,\nincluding by Machery (2018), Frankish (2018), Gauker (2018), and\nWilkinson, in collaboration with Fernyhough (Wilkinson &\nFernyhough 2018).\n\nThe idea that inner speech involves an internal dialogue or\nconversation clearly has intuitive appeal for some. One often finds\ninner speech described outside the philosophical context as the\n\u201cinner dialogue\u201d. But, if inner speech involves a kind of\ninternal dialogue or conversation on more than a metaphorical level,\nthen it is natural to wonder who the interlocutors are (Gregory\n2020a). Machery (2018) and Frankish (2018) suggest that different\nparts of the brain communicate with one another via inner speech.\nGauker (2018) suggests that inner speech involves conversing with\noneself (see also the discussion of inner speech as a means for\ninteraction between subsystems or modules in the mind in\n Section 2.2).\n One difficulty with both of these suggestions, however, is that\nphilosophers of language generally (though not universally) think of\nconversation as fundamentally involving distinct human agents.\n\nGregory (2017) appeals to Grice\u2019s (1975 [2013]) account of\nconversation to make this point. Grice argued that conversations are\n\u201ccharacteristically \u2026 cooperative efforts\u201d (p.\n314). But cooperation requires multiple agents and there is only one\nagent in inner speech. That said, Gauker (2011, 2018) is working with\nan explicitly non-Gricean picture of conversation, motivated by an\nopposition to the doctrine that speech acts serve to express thoughts\nthat are distinct from and precede the expressive utterance. He holds\nthat speaking is,\n\n\nin the first instance, something we do whenever there is no reason not\nto, because of the good it tends to do. (2018: 71)\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, where multiple individuals are present,\n\n\n[a] conversation can be the occasion for each interlocutor to reflect\non what he or she has experienced, \u2026 and on that basis to\nelicit a statement that is useful from the other. (2018: 72)\n\n\nInsofar as we can generate inner speech episodes which cause us to\nreflect on some matter and then produce further inner speech episodes\nwhich are useful for us in the context, inner speech will be\nconversational. Gauker\u2019s analysis here obviously reflects the\nexpression-oriented approach to the question of whether there can be\nspeech acts in inner speech.\n\nIn contrast to Gauker, Deamer (2021) argues that inner speech can be\nseen as being communicative in a Gricean sense. She holds that, to at\nleast some extent, humans are \u201cself-blind\u201d: mental states\nsuch as our intentions are not always transparent to us. When we\nproduce inner speech, we reveal our communicative intentions to\nourselves, just as we reveal our communicative intentions to others\nwhen we converse with them.\n\nWhile there is disagreement as to whether a series of inner speech\nepisodes can be a dialogue in a literal sense, most agree that inner\nspeech often closely resembles dialogue. As Gauker notes, one episode\nof inner speech will often prompt another, as happens in interpersonal\ndialogue. We can produce episodes of inner speech corresponding to\ndifferent points of view, e.g., when thinking about the considerations\nfor and against some course of action, in a way similar to two people\nwith different opinions. Some participants in studies report that some\nof their inner speech episodes take place in the voices of others\n(McCarthy-Jones & Fernyhough 2011; Alderson-Day, Mitrenga, et al.\n2018). This last consideration raises an important issue. We can\ncertainly imagine conversing with others and we can certainly imagine\nothers conversing. Such cases are usually taken to be distinct from\ninner speech (see\n Section 1).\n However, if inner speech can involve the voices of others, possibly\nexpressing viewpoints other than our own, it becomes difficult to say\nhow instances of inner speech with these characteristics differ from\ncases of imagining others speaking. How to delineate the extension of\n\u201cinner speech\u201d in a way that distinguishes inner speech\nacts from cases of (merely) imagining speech remains an underexplored\nissue.\n5. Self-Knowledge and Metacognition\n\nInner speech plays an important role in a number of philosophical\naccounts of self-knowledge and metacognition. By\n\u201cself-knowledge\u201d we will mean knowledge of one\u2019s own\nmental states, including both dispositional states\u2014like beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions\u2014and occurrent states, such as thoughts,\nimaginings, decisions, and judgments. The notion of metacognition is\nsomewhat broader, also encompassing judgments and non-cognitive\nassessments (e.g., \u201cfeelings of knowing\u201d) concerning the\nvalidity of one\u2019s own reasoning, the quality of one\u2019s\nevidence, one\u2019s degree of certainty, and so on (Proust 2013).\nWhile some theorists implicate inner speech in their accounts of both\nself-knowledge and metacognition (Jackendoff 1996; Clark 1998;\nBerm\u00fadez 2003, 2018), others focus more narrowly on the\nquestion of how inner speech might facilitate self-knowledge (Byrne\n2018; Carruthers 2011; Roessler 2016). A common thread among theorists\nwho invoke inner speech in their accounts of metacognition or\nself-knowledge is the idea that certain others of our mental\nstates\u2014namely, those that our inner speech helps us to know\nabout\u2014are either less readily available to introspection or less\nwell suited to serve a metacognitive role. Thus, these views all\nappear against a backdrop of broader commitments about the nature of\nmental states and our introspective access to them.\n5.1 Metacognitive Approaches\n\nOne approach sees inner speech as especially well suited to aid in\nmetacognition due to its linguistic structure, or its link to public\nlanguage more generally. According to Andy Clark (1998), the fact that\ninner speech occurs in a language\u2014where such language is seen as\nabstracting away from the particularities of perception\u2014allows\nit to play a special role in \u201csecond-order cognitive\ndynamics\u201d (see also Prinz 2011, 2012). This, he holds, is\nbecause the natural language sentences featured in inner speech are\n\u201ccontext resistant\u201d and \u201cmodality\ntranscending\u201d in ways that facilitate a more objective and\nreliable assessment of the soundness of one\u2019s own thought\nprocesses (Clark 1998: 178). Berm\u00fadez (2003, 2018) builds on\nClark\u2019s proposal, specifying that awareness of inner speech is\nessential for enabling humans to become conscious of their own\npropositional thought processes, which are otherwise amodal and\ninaccessible to introspection. According to Berm\u00fadez,\n\n\nall the propositional thoughts that we consciously introspect\n\u2026 take the form of sentences in a public language. (emphasis\noriginal, 2003: 159\u2013160)\n\n\nWhile he does not identify these public language sentences with our\ncore thought processes themselves\u2014these, he holds, occur in a\nsubconscious language of thought\u2014Berm\u00fadez argues that the\nlinguistic structure of inner speech is needed to adequately represent\nthe relationships of entailment and rational support that may (or may\nnot) exist among the subconscious thoughts the inner speech episodes\nserve to express. As he puts it,\n\n\nwe think about thoughts through thinking about the sentences through\nwhich those thoughts might be expressed. (2003: 164)\n\n\nJackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011, 2012) and Prinz (2011, 2012) likewise\nhold that there is a level of conceptual thought that is not directly\navailable to introspection and that inner speech is well suited for\nmaking us aware of such thoughts. Yet, for Jackendoff and Prinz, inner\nspeech is able to play this role primarily because, like other\nimagistic mental states, inner speech occurs at an\n\u201cintermediate\u201d level of representation, which, on their\ntheories, is the only level of representation at which mental states\nare consciously available to the subject. Thus Jackendoff\u2019s\ncomment that \u201cwe are aware of our thinking because we hear the\nassociated sounds in our heads\u201d (2011: 613). Echoing\nBerm\u00fadez and Clark, Prinz finds it\n\n\nlikely that we often come to know what we are thinking by hearing\ninner statements of the sentences that we would use to express our\nthoughts (2011:. 186)\n\n\nand judges inner speech to be \u201ca way of registering complex\nthoughts in consciousness\u201d (2011: 186). (See also Machery 2005,\n2018.)\n5.2 Inferentialist Approaches\n\nSeveral theorists, who we will term \u201cinferentialists\u201d,\nfollow Ryle (1949 [2009]) in his claim that we often come to know what\nwe are thinking by \u201coverhear[ing]\u201d, or\n\u201ceavesdrop[ping] on \u2026 our own silent monologues\u201d\n(1949 [2009: 165]). On these views, we come to know what we are\nthinking, or what we believe or desire, by drawing a kind of inference\n(the nature of which differs, depending on the theorist) from the fact\nthat we \u201chear\u201d ourselves say something in inner speech.\nThe views of Clark, Berm\u00fadez, Jackendoff, and Prinz, already\nreviewed, are inferentialist in nature. Yet there are other approaches\nthat incorporate inner speech into a process that is even more\nexplicitly inferential.\n\nCarruthers (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018) is an inferentialist of this\nlatter sort. While, in earlier work, he argued that thought itself\noccurs in inner speech (Carruthers 2002), Carruthers later abandoned\nthat idea to hold that thoughts (including one\u2019s beliefs) are\nalways unconscious. On this view, inner speech episodes remain more or\nless directly available to introspection, yet only provide a kind of\nindirect evidence for what we are in fact judging or deciding (or\nbelieving, desiring, or intending) unconsciously. He emphasizes the\nfallible nature of such inferences, arguing on the basis of various\nempirical studies that many of the inferences people arrive at about\ntheir own beliefs and desires are in fact incorrect. Similarly to\nJackendoff and Prinz, Carruthers holds that only sensory states are\nable to serve as inputs to the mental mechanism responsible for self-\n(and other-) directed mindreading. These inputs include visual and\nother forms of sensory imagery in addition to inner speech. However,\nin cases where we are having thoughts about abstract matters that are\ndifficult to unambiguously represent with other forms of\nimagery\u2014such as the thought that philosophy is a challenging\nsubject\u2014episodes of inner speech are held to provide an\nespecially important source of information that one is having such\nthoughts. Carruthers emphasizes that the process becomes especially\ninferential in nature where other contextual information\u2014such as\nthat one sees oneself lingering over a choice of cereal\nbox\u2014combines with one\u2019s inner speech to generate an\nall-things-considered appraisal of what one is currently judging or\ndeciding. Cassam (2011, 2014) likewise implicates inner speech in a\nmulti-faceted inferentialist account of self-knowledge, though not\npitched in terms of \u201cmindreading\u201d mechanisms or other\nconstructs from cognitive science.\n\nAlex Byrne (2011, 2018) puts inner speech to somewhat different ends\nin his inferentialist account of how we know what we are thinking. For\nByrne, there is no such thing as inner speech, strictly speaking,\nbecause there are no sounds (or voices) in the head. However, there\nare such things as auditory-phonological representations of voices.\nThese give rise to an apparent perception of what we come to think of\nas the \u201cinner voice\u201d. By trying to attend to what the\ninner voice says, Byrne proposes, we can reliably form judgments about\nwhat we are thinking. The epistemic rule he proposes for doing so\nis:\n\n\nTHINK: If the inner voice speaks about x, believe that you\nare thinking about x.\n\n\nAs with Carruthers, a key motivation for Byrne\u2019s account of how\nwe know what we are thinking is a background view\u2014motivated by\nthe work of Shoemaker (1994), Dretske (2003), and others\u2014that we\nhave no other, more direct introspective method for knowing our own\nthoughts (i.e., we lack something like an \u201cinner sense\u201d).\nNote that Byrne\u2019s approach is inferentialist in that he takes\ninner speech to be implicated in inferences that lead to knowledge of\none\u2019s own occurrent thoughts. Yet the sort of inference involved\nis quite different from that envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam, who\nboth hold that inner speech episodes are just one kind of information\namong many that may be brought to bear in inferences about one\u2019s\nstanding and occurrent mental states. Importantly, the form of\ninference envisioned by Carruthers and Cassam is essentially the same\nin its first and third person applications, whereas Byrne\u2019s\nTHINK rule is of an inferential procedure that can only be used to\nreliably generate true beliefs about one\u2019s own mental states. In\nByrne\u2019s view, this helps to explain the \u201cpeculiar\u201d\nnature of introspection, where this peculiarity lies in the fact that\nour methods for knowing our own mental states are (intuitively)\ndifferent from those we use to know others\u2019 (Byrne 2011, 2018).\nFurther, on Byrne\u2019s version of inferentialism, the inferences we\nform by trying to follow THINK are extremely likely to amount to\nknowledge\u2014thereby cohering with the intuition that knowledge of\none\u2019s own current thoughts is epistemically privileged. Whereas,\nthe kinds of metacognitive inferences that Carruthers and Cassam\nenvision to rely on inner speech are (by their own telling)\nepistemically on a par with our inferences about the mental states of\nothers and far more susceptible to error.\n5.3 Inferentialism\u2019s Critics\n\nSeveral philosophers object that inferentialist proposals leave us at\ntoo great an epistemic distance from our own thoughts (Bar-On &\nOchs 2018; Roessler 2016) or have other unworkable features\n(Langland-Hassan 2014; Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010;\nRoessler 2016). Roessler (2016) pursues a non-observational account of\nthe role of inner speech in generating self-knowledge. Rejecting the\nidea that we need to \u201ceavesdrop on ourselves\u201d by attending\nto our inner speech, Roessler suggests we follow remarks of Ryle (1949\n[2009]) and Anscombe (1957) in understanding the knowledge gained\nthrough inner speech as a kind of \u201cpractical knowledge\u201d,\n(or, for Ryle, \u201cserial knowledge\u201d), where knowing what one\nis thinking is understood as a special case of knowing what one is\ndoing.\n\nBar-On & Ochs (2018) likewise take aim at what they term\n\u201cNeo-Rylean\u201d invocations of inner speech, arguing that\nByrne\u2019s THINK rule fails to identify a special role for inner\nspeech in facilitating self-knowledge. Drawing on Bar-On\u2019s\n(2004) broader expressivist approach to self-knowledge, Bar-On and\nOchs hold that a proper account of inner speech\u2019s role in\nself-knowledge should show how such knowledge is \u201cdistinctive\nand uniquely first-personal\u201d in that it is\n\n\nknowledge that one can be said to have in virtue of being in a\nprivileged position to give direct voice to one\u2019s thoughts.\n(2018: 20)\n\n\nThey do not, however, develop a positive account in detail.\n\nVicente & Mart\u00ednez-Manrique (2005, 2008;\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2010) have criticized\nBerm\u00fadez\u2019s and related inferentialist views on the\ngrounds that the semantics of natural language sentences\u2014and\ninner speech episodes, in particular\u2014are underdetermined in ways\nincompatible with providing knowledge of one\u2019s thoughts. For\ninstance, the sentence \u201cJane\u2019s cup is full\u201d, is\nambiguous in several ways, including the sense in which it is\nJane\u2019s cup (does she own it? is she just using it? is it the one\nshe merely wants?) and the sense in which it is full (is it full of\nair? of liquid? of coins?). If the explicit meaning of a sentence is\nonly extracted (and disambiguated) at the level of thought itself,\nthey argue, it is unclear how awareness of semantically indeterminate\ninner speech utterances could suffice for awareness of one\u2019s\nown\u2014presumably explicit and unambiguous\u2014propositional\nthoughts. Berm\u00fadez replies in his 2018 paper.\n\nJorba & Vicente (2014) and Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente\n(2015) criticize what they call the \u201cformat view\u201d of inner\nspeech (which they attribute to Jackendoff and others) which holds\nthat we are conscious of our inner speech episodes only because of\ntheir sensory format (see also Fern\u00e1ndez Castro 2016). If these\ncriticisms succeed, they cast doubt on views, such as those of\nCarruthers (2010), Jackendoff (1996), and Prinz (2012), which link the\nmetacognitive or introspective value of inner speech to its occurrence\nin a sensory format.\n\nLangland-Hassan (2014) raises a different sort of challenge for\ninferentialist views. Recall that it is a common assumption of those\nviews that propositional thought itself is amodal (i.e., non-sensory)\nand non-conscious. For theorists such as Carruthers, Prinz,\nJackendoff, and Berm\u00fadez, inner speech is a conscious mental\nprocess just because it has sensory features that render it the sort\nof state that is apt to be conscious. Langland-Hassan argues that\nthere is a conflict in holding that an episode of inner speech is a\nsingle mental state with both sensory features (relating to the\nrepresentation of phonemes) and semantic features (relating to the\nmeanings of the corresponding words). If this criticism is correct, it\ncreates problems for the proposal that inner speech is especially well\nsuited (due to its sensory character) to serve as input to inferences\nabout one\u2019s non-conscious mental states. Berm\u00fadez (2018),\nCarruthers (2018), and Munroe (2023) have articulated different ways\nof responding to this challenge (see also Prinz 2011 for relevant\nremarks).\n6. Auditory Verbal Hallucinations and Inserted Thoughts\n\nInner speech features prominently in philosophical and cognitive\nscientific discussions of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and\nthought insertion. Both are common symptoms of schizophrenia but can\noccur in other contexts (e.g., brain injury, drug use) as well. AVHs\nare hallucinatory experiences of another\u2019s speech, while thought\ninsertion is understood either as a non-veridical experience of having\nsomeone else\u2019s thoughts in one\u2019s mind (Wing et al. 1990),\nor simply as the delusional belief that someone else\u2019s thoughts\nare in one\u2019s mind (Andreasen 1984). Two central questions\nexplored by theorists are, first, whether (abnormal) inner speech is\nindeed the basis of AVHs or thought insertion, and, second, what might\nlead an episode of inner speech to be experienced as an AVH or\ninserted thought.\n\nOn the first question, an initially plausible approach to AVHs is to\nhold that they are more a matter of hallucinatory speech\nperception than of (unwitting) speech production, and thus\nnot well conceived as episodes of inner speech. Wu (2012) and Cho\n& Wu (2013, 2014) advance a theory of this kind, holding that AVHs\nresult from the spontaneous activation of speech perception areas in\nthe brain. On their account, inner speech\u2014and, in particular,\nthe neural regions implicated in speech production\u2014are not\nimplicated in AVHs. Despite the attractive simplicity of this account,\nmost researchers have pursued options that explicitly involve inner\nspeech, for several reasons. First, in formal surveys, patients often\nreport that the phenomenological characteristics of their AVHs are\ndifferent from those of hearing speech, insofar as their AVHs are not\nas subjectively \u201cloud\u201d as cases of hearing speech, are not\nequally rich in sensory features, and do not always seem to emanate\nfrom outside the head (Stephens & Graham 2000; Hoffman et al.\n2008; Laroi et al. 2012; Nayani & David 1996; Stephane 2019). It\nappears that an explanation of the seemingly \u201calien\u201d\nnature of these episodes, as well as of thought insertion, will\nrequire some other apparatus than an appeal to perception-like\nphenomenology. Given the need for such an alternative, one may hope to\nextend it also to cases of AVHs that are reported as having rich,\nperception-like phenomenological features (Langland-Hassan 2008;\nMoseley & Wilkinson 2014).\n\nSecond, neuroimaging has shown activation in both language perception\nand language production areas when patients are experiencing\nAVHs (Allen, Aleman, & Mcguire 2007; Allen, Modinos, et al. 2012;\nBohlken, Hugdahl, & Sommer 2017). Here as in other areas of the\nstudy of inner speech, it is important to recognize that the neural\nregions underlying speech production (such as Broca\u2019s area, in\nthe left inferior frontal gyrus) are distinct from those governing\nspeech perception (such as Wernicke\u2019s area, in the superior\ntemporal gyrus). This is why damage to one area but not the other (as\nin some cases of stroke) can result in markedly different language\nimpairments. The fact that the mechanisms governing speech production\nand perception are dissociable in these ways provides an important\nmeans for assessing whether AVHs are best viewed as productive or\nperceptual (or both) in nature.\n\nNevertheless, those who see abnormal inner speech episodes as the\nbasis for AVHs or thought insertion face a difficult task in\nexplaining what would lead a person to not identify their own inner\nspeech as their own, or to not feel in control of their own inner\nspeech. Some have offered content-based explanations, where it is some\nfeature of the semantic content of the inner speech that leads a\nperson to disown it. For instance, Stephens and Graham (2000) argue\nthat a patient may disown inner speech episodes with contents that are\n\u201cintentionally inexplicable\u201d, in the sense that they are\nnot easily accommodated within a coherent self-narrative (see also\nRoessler (2013), Sollberger (2014), Bortolotti & Broome (2009),\nand Fern\u00e1ndez (2010) on the idea that AVHs or inserted thoughts\nare episodes with contents the patient is unwilling to endorse).\nChallenges for this approach are patient reports of voices that are\nhelpful or encouraging. As the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler notes\nin early work on people with schizophrenia, \u201cbesides their\npersecutors, the patients often hear the voice of some\nprotector\u201d, and, occasionally, the hallucinatory voices\n\u201crepresent sound criticism of the [the patient\u2019s]\ndelusional thoughts and pathological drives\u201d (1911 [1950:\n98]).\n\nA popular alternative approach\u2014sometimes known as the\n\u201ccomparator\u201d or \u201csensory feedback\u201d\napproach\u2014builds on work in cognitive neuroscience concerning the\nmechanisms by which bodily movements are determined to be one\u2019s\nown (Feinberg 1978; Frith 1992; Miall et al. 1993; Wolpert, Miall\n& Kawato 1998). The basic idea behind these approaches is that,\nbelow the level of consciousness, the brain is continually generating\npredictions about the likely sensory consequences of planned actions,\nwhich are then compared with actual sensory feedback. When there is a\nmismatch between the prediction and sensory feedback, one may have the\nphenomenological sense of not being in control of one\u2019s actions\n(Frith 2012). A number of authors have proposed that the generation of\nboth inner and outer speech may be attended by the same kind of\nprediction and comparison mechanisms, and that the malfunctioning of\nthese mechanisms could lead to one\u2019s own inner speech seeming\nnot to be in one\u2019s control (Blakemore, Smith, et al. 2000;\nCampbell 1999; Langland-Hassan 2016; Proust 2006). These proposals\nderive some support from the fact that people with schizophrenia have\nbeen shown to have broader deficits in automatically anticipating and\nadjusting for the sensory consequences of their own actions\n(Blakemore, Smith et al. 2000; Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith\n1998).\n\nNevertheless, the comparator approach to AVHs and thought insertion\nhas come in for criticism on several grounds (Synofzik, Vosgerau &\nNewen 2008; Vicente 2014; Vosgerau & Newen 2007). One complaint\nhas been that the lack of sensory features associated with inserted\nthoughts, in particular, makes sensory-feedback approaches ill-suited\nto their explanation (Vosgerau & Newen 2007). In response, some\ndefenders have shifted to pitching the thesis in terms of predictive\nprocessing models of perception and action (Gerrans 2015; Swiney 2018;\nSwiney & Sousa 2014; Wilkinson 2014; Wilkinson & Fernyhough\n2017), while others have developed other alternatives (Langland-Hassan\nforthcoming). The matter of how best to characterize the phenomenology\nand underlying etiology of AVHs and thought insertion\u2014and the\nrelation of each to inner speech\u2014together with the precise\nrelationship between predictive processing models and the comparator\napproach, remain active areas of research. See Wilkinson &\nAlderson-Day (2016) for an introduction to an edited special-issue on\nthe topic oriented at philosophers; see L\u00f3pez-Silva &\nMcClelland (forthcoming) for a philosophically-oriented anthology on\nthought insertion.
