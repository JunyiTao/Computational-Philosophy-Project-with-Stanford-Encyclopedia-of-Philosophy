The 18th Century: The Difficult Reception of Modernity\n\nIn both the 17th and 18th centuries, it was\nresponsibility of the main religious orders to teach philosophy in New\nSpain, in accordance with their specific doctrinal orientation.\nFranciscans adopted the philosophy of Duns Scotus; Dominicans, that of\nThomas Aquinas; and the Jesuits were more receptive to modern\nphilosophy. However, in the 18th century, the most\ninfluential philosophers struggled to reconcile the apparent tension\nbetween religion and science and between the modern and Scholastic\ntradition.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Jesuits were leaders in education\nand culture in New Spain. Their work is of central importance, not\nonly because they adapted modern European thought to their own\ncircumstances, but also because they helped to instill a sense of\nnational identity that would result in political independence from\nSpain in the 19th century. However, in 1767, at the height\nof their influence (and precisely because of their influence), the\nSpanish Crown expelled the Jesuits from its territories. This was a\nheavy blow to the development of modern philosophy in Mexico, and it\nfueled a nascent sense of Mexican national identity among the subjects\nof Spanish colonial rule.\n\nAmong the main Jesuits of New Spain who were forced to leave their\nhomeland were two prominent philosophers: Diego Jos\u00e9 Abad and\nFrancisco Javier Clavijero. Diego Jos\u00e9 Abad taught a complete\ncourse on philosophy in which he studied modern philosophers such as\nDescartes and Gassendi. Abad tried to reconcile modern philosophy and\nScholasticism by trying, for example, to reconcile atomism and\nAristotelian hylomorphism. Francisco Javier Clavijero\n(1731\u20131787) wrote Storia antica del Messico (1780\n[2006]) in which he examines pre-Columbian history using the model of\nGreco-Roman classical history. He also wrote a Cursus\nphilosophicus, of which only one section has been preserved:\nPhysica particularis (1765).\n\nOther influential philosophers, educators, and students of\ncontemporary philosophy are Juan Benito D\u00edaz de Gamarra\n(1745\u20131783), author of Elementa recentioris\nphilosophiae (1774); the polymath Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alzate\n(1737\u20131799), a ferocious critic of Aristotle; and Jos\u00e9\nMariano Moci\u00f1o (1757\u20131820), a distinguished expert in\nbotany. All three proved influential in challenging the Colonial rule\nof Spain by challenging the dominance of tradition for the sake of\ntradition.\n",
