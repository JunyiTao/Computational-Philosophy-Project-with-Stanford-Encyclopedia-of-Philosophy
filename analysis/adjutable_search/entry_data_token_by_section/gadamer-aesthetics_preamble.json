    "main_text": "\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer (1900\u20132002) does not provide an account of\nthe aesthetic in any customary sense. His approach to art runs, in\nmany ways, against conventional philosophical expectations. Aesthetic\nqualities are not debated in the manner of the analytic tradition of\nmodern philosophy, nor does he concern himself overtly with the\nproblems of aesthetic pleasure. Gadamer\u2019s approach to aesthetic\nexperience stands squarely in the phenomenological tradition. He is\nprimarily concerned with the place of art in our experience of the\nworld. Furthermore, his approach to aesthetic theory is one of those\nrare intellectual achievements which is simultaneously deconstructive\nand constructive. He dismantles elements of the grand tradition of\nPlatonic, Kantian, and Hegelian aesthetics and yet offers a\nhermeneutical and phenomenological reconstruction of many of the\ncentral insights of that tradition to demonstrate its continuing\nrelevance to our contemporary experience of art. Gadamer is primarily\nconcerned with the cognitive dimension of such experience, with what\nartworks address and what they put at issue. This makes for a flexible\nphilosophical approach capable of ranging freely over a number of art\nforms and styles, discussing both the singularity of works and their\nbroader significance. The approach is clearly hermeneutical in that it\nendeavors to reacquaint us with those received meanings and\npreoccupations which underlie our experience of art. Openly influenced\nby Martin Heidegger, the later essays on language and poetry in\nparticular, Gadamer\u2019s aesthetics is far from traditional. His\nkey claims are:\n\nAesthetics is not the study of specific types of subjective\npleasures derived from art. It is a study of what objectively informs\nour subjective awareness of art.\nHermeneutical aesthetics seeks to break through the pleasurable\ndistractions of aesthetic consciousness in order to disclose the\ncultural and linguistic realities that manifest themselves within\nit.\nHermeneutical aesthetics presupposes phenomenological involvement\nwith the subject matters of art rather than disinterested\ndetachment.\nHermeneutical aesthetics regards aesthetic appearance not as a\ndistraction from the real but as the vehicle through which real\nsubject matters reveal themselves. It overturns the notion that\nartworks are at one remove from reality.\nHermeneutical aesthetics is dialogical in character. It recognises\nthat practitioner and theoretician share in bringing a subject matter\nto light and plays down any theory/practice division in the arts.\nInterpretation is a means to a work\u2019s realization.\nHermeneutical aesthetics is not a theory of art per se,\nmore a set of practical contemplative notes for enhancing one\u2019s\nencounter with art. The end of hermeneutical aesthetics is not to\narrive at a concept of art but to deepen our experience of art. In\nhermeneutical aesthetics, theory is deployed to deepen contemplation\nof artworks rather than to categorize their nature.\nGadamer\u2019s aesthetics is deeply respectful of art\u2019s\nability to disrupt and challenge customary expectations. It attributes\nan ethical significance to art as being able to reveal the limitations\nof fixed cultural expectancy and to open the spectator towards the\nother and the different.\n\n\nIn this entry, we discuss the leading arguments which inform these\ncontentions.\n",
