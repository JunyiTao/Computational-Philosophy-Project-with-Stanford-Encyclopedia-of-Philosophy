    "main_text": "Truth and Truth-Making || Locate the Truth-Makers\n6.1 Locate the Truth-Makers\n\nTruth-makers for truths about the past aren\u2019t easy to find. We\nare searching for entities \u201cin virtue of\u201d which\npropositions about the past are true. For example, <Curie\nexisted> is true in virtue of some entity, its\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d. But what plays the truth-making role?\nSchematically, two kinds of solution can be given here: (i) posit\npresently existing truth-makers, or (ii) posit truth-makers that exist\n\u201coutside time\u201d. Option (ii) is open to presentists who\ncountenance the existence of some atemporal entities (e.g.,\npropositions, numbers, etc.), though such a version of presentism\nwould require a defense of the idea that entities that exist\noutside of time do no violence to the claim that \u201conly\npresent things exist\u201d\n (\u00a71).\n\nPresentism can be amended via the addition of atemporal\ntruth-makers\u2014truth-making entities that are, in a sense,\n\u201coutside\u201d time (see Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007). This is\n\u201cersatz presentism\u201d. Ersatz presentists claim that, e.g.,\n<Curie existed> is \u201cmade true\u201d by an abstract time\nthat represents how things were when Curie existed. (This is an\n\u201cersatz\u201d time, rather than a \u201cgenuine\u201d\nconcrete time.) One way to understand ersatz presentism is as the view\nthat there\u2019s an abstract four-dimensional manifold of times that\nrepresents how things were, are now, and will be. This manifold is\nordered by an ersatz B-theoretic \u201cearlier than\u201d relation\nand forms an ersatz B series of times. The truth-makers for truths\nabout the past are abstracta: the ersatz times. An ersatz time,\nT, represents how things were (at some past time) by\nsome other ersatz time, T*, accurately representing how the\nconcrete world is now, and by T bearing the\n\u201cearlier than\u201d relation (the \u201cersatz\nB-relation\u201d) to T*.\n\nErsatz presentism is popular, but option (i)\u2014positing present\ntruth-makers\u2014includes more variation. The most well-known\nversion of this view is \u201cLucretianism\u201d espoused by John\nBigelow (1996). Lucretians claim that <Curie existed> is made\ntrue by the world now instantiating a primitive past-tensed property\n(a \u201cLucretian\u201d property) of having contained Marie Curie.\nThe presently existing truth-maker is the present instantiation of the\nLucretian property (having contained Curie) by the world.\nThere are a range of other \u201cproperty solutions\u201d, alongside\nLucretianism, which differ in important respects, but which share a\ncommon core. For instance: see Keller (2004: 94\u2013101) on a range\nof solutions, including one with indestructible atoms and their\nproperties, Cameron (2011, 2013) on temporal distributional\nproperties, McKinnon & Bigelow (2012) on tensing the instantiation\ntie, and Ingram (2018) on uninstantiated thisnesses, amongst\nothers.\n\nResponses to positions that posit present truth-makers (i.e.,\nBigelow\u2019s Lucretianism and \u201cBigelow-style\u201d property\nsolutions, mentioned briefly) are that each suffers from three\nproblems, perhaps only one of which afflicts the ersatzer\u2019s\nproposal. The problems facing presentism supplemented with these\ntruth-makers are as follows.\n\nFirst, note that any solution must ensure that the truth-makers\ndeliver the \u201cright results\u201d with respect to what\u2019s\ntrue about the past. To illustrate, consider the following natural\nprogression of an object through time. Our story begins with a green\nbanana. Time passes; the banana ripens. The banana is now yellow, but\nit was green. The world now instantiates the property having\ncontained a green banana (so says the Lucretian). So far, so\ngood. But consider a progression where the banana ripens and yet the\nworld comes to instantiate a different Lucretian property. Suppose\nthat the world instantiates having contained a red banana\ninstead. This is problematic. In the scenario imagined, though it was\nthe case that the world contained a green banana, <There was a\ngreen banana> is false; and, despite the world never having\ncontained a red banana, <There was a red banana> is true.\nAlthough the problematic progression is deviant, the worry with\nproperty solutions is that these kinds of progression appear\npossible, given the advertised metaphysic. If such deviant\nprogressions are possible, we can object to these present entities\nbeing the right kind of truth-makers for truths about the past (see\nTallant & Ingram 2012; Cameron 2013; Leininger 2015).\n\nA second concern with \u201cproperty solutions\u201d stems from the\nworry that the kind of properties involved, e.g., tensed\n\u201cLucretian\u201d properties, are wholly objectionable. Some\nregard properties such as having contained dinosaurs as\n\u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cdubious\u201d entities\u2014they\nare objectionable entities that shouldn\u2019t be countenanced in a\nrespectable metaphysic. They are objectionable because, in a sense\nthat\u2019s difficult to pin down, they point beyond their\ninstances (their bearers). Thus, having contained dinosaurs\nis a property that \u201cpoints beyond\u201d how the world is\nnow; it points beyond the intrinsic nature of its bearer, and\n\u201cpoints\u201d to how the world was; namely, containing\ndinosaurs. And, say the objectors, acceptable properties aren\u2019t\nlike that; respectable properties don\u2019t point beyond (see Sider\n2001: 39\u201342; Crisp 2007: 93\u201398; Merricks 2007:\n134\u20136; Cameron 2011: 58\u201362).\n\nAnother significant objection facing presentist attempts to solve the\ntruth-maker objection is based on \u201caboutness\u201d intuitions\nand their role in determining which entity (or entities) is an\nadequate truth-maker for some truth. The idea goes as follows. A truth\n(any truth) is about something. If a proposition is made true\u2014if\na proposition \u201cowes its truth\u201d to something in the\nworld\u2014then the thing in the world that makes the proposition\ntrue should be what the truth is about (Merricks 2007: 28\u201334).\nAfter all, <Taylor loves to sing> is about Taylor and her love\nof singing. It would be altogether wrong for that proposition to be\nmade true by the existence of anything other than Taylor and her love\nof singing. At least, so goes the thought.\n\nHowever, all these \u201csolutions\u201d to the truth-maker\nobjection share a common feature: the past entities that propositions\nabout the past seem to be about don\u2019t exist, given\npresentism. Marie Curie doesn\u2019t exist, yet <Curie existed>\nis about Curie. There are no dinosaurs, yet <there were\ndinosaurs> is about them. Our \u201caboutness\u201d\nintuitions tell us that propositions about the past should be\nmade true by past entities, but they simply cannot be, given\npresentism. Whether the truth-makers we posit exist now, or\nexist outside time, the kind of entities that we posit won\u2019t be\nup to the task. If we respect the aboutness constraint (on truth-maker\ntheory), and cannot shake off this objection, we will likely be\ninclined to give up on solving the objection by attempting to locate\nthe required truth-makers. (There are some exceptions. E.g., Ingram\n2019 develops a Bigelow-style response and argues that the putative\ntruth-makers, uninstantiated thisnesses, do satisfy aboutness\nintuitions.)\n",
