    "main_text": "Numenius' Platonism\n2. Numenius' Platonism\n\n\nThe remains of Numenius' work leave no doubt that he relied primarily\non texts of Plato in constructing his own system of\nprinciples. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those\nthat classify him as a Platonist philosopher (Porphyry, Life of\nPlot. 14.12, Eusebius, Prep. Ev. XI.21.7) and those that\nconsider him a Pythagorean (Origen, Against Celsus I.15, VI.51, V.38\nfrs. 1b\u20131c, 53, Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 34.20\u201335.2;\nfr. 36, Calcidius, In Timaeum 297.8 Waszink; fr. 52.2). We\nshould not see any contradiction or even tension in this double\nclassification. Numenius is a Pythagorean Platonist like Moderatus\nhalf a century earlier or Eudorus around the turn of the\nmillennium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the\ntwo authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded\nPlato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he\nconsidered to be the source of all true philosophy\u2014including\nPlato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many\nphilosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed\non only orally (cf. fr. 24.57-60).\n\n\nThis view of Numenius is part of a general view about the history of\nphilosophy that we can reconstruct from his fragments.  Numenius\nbelieves that the truths given to us by philosophy have a status like\nthat claimed for the scriptures by revealed religions: they are the\nrevelation of logos (reason) in which all nations have a\nshare (frs. 1a, 1b) but which only certain inspired geniuses could\narticulate properly and explain for the first time. Numenius appears\nto believe that the religious practices of the various nations are\nphilosophically significant, because they contain some lore or\n\u201cwisdom\u201d that reflects philosophical truth. We find a\nsimilar view first in Posidonius (1st c. BCE) (in Seneca,\nEpist. 90.5-13, 20-25, 30-32; fr. 284 Edelstein-Kidd) and\nthen it appears in variations in several authors of the first two\ncenturies CE. The Platonist Celsus, for instance, who must have been\nNumenius' contemporary, wrote a work entitled True Account,\nin which he criticizes Christianity for deviating from the fundamental\noriginal wisdom that he takes to lie behind the religions of many\nnations (Origen, Against Celsus I.14, 16; see Frede 1994,\n5193\u20135198). A similar view is maintained by Plutarch\n(fr. 157.16\u201325 Sandbach; cf. his On Isis and Osiris)\nbut also by the 1st c. CE Stoic Cornutus in his\nIntroduction to Greek Theology (see Boys-Stones 2001,\n49\u201359, 105\u2013114). \n\n\nNumenius maintains that in the Greek tradition the revelation coming\nfrom reason was first grasped and articulated in properly\nphilosophical terms by Pythagoras, the source of true philosophy; it\nthen found its way into the philosophy of Plato. Numenius argues that\nPlato appropriated Pythagoras' doctrine and outlined it in his own\nwork (fr. 24.56\u201362). He suggests that Plato accessed Pythagorean\nphilosophy directly, presumably through his own acquaintance with\nPythagoreans, but also indirectly through Socrates, who, according to\nNumenius, was also philosophically a Pythagorean and was communicating\nto his pupils Pythagorean doctrines (fr 24.51\u201359), most\nespecially the doctrine of the three gods, that is, the One,\nIntellect, and the creator-demiurge (see below, Metaphysics), which is\nallegedly outlined in the pseudo-Platonic\n2nd Letter (312e). Numenius suggests that Plato\nwas in a position to recognize Socrates' Pythagoreanism because,\nbefore meeting him, Plato had already familiarized himself with\nPythagorean philosophy (fr. 24.57). On Numenius' view, then, Plato\nspeaks with authority in his many and extensive published works\nprecisely because he communicates Pythagorean doctrines. But to the\nextent that Plato's philosophy is derivative from the Pythagorean one,\nthe authority of Plato's written work is inferior to that of\nPythagoras (frs. 7.5\u20137, 26.12\u201322). This is why Numenius\nrecommends a move away from Plato towards the discourses of Pythagoras\n(fr. 1a). Numenius appears to claim even that Plato was not\nfaultless. Plato, Numenius suggests, did not present his doctrines\nsufficiently clearly.  This is why Numenius holds Plato partly\nresponsible for the departure of later Platonists (i.e. the Academic\nskeptics) from Plato's actual Pythagorean philosophy\n(fr. 24.60\u201366; Karamanolis 2006, 130\u2013131). Plato's\nobscurity is pointed out by several other Platonists in late\nantiquity, such as Plutarch (On Isis and Osiris\n370E-F, On the Obsolescence of the oracles 421F) and Plotinus\n(Ennead IV.4.22.6-12), but none of them means this to be a\ncriticism of Plato, as is the case with Numenius, whose point is that\nPlato did not make sufficiently clear his intellectual debt to\nPythagoreanism and that this may have played a role in the dissension of\nhis followers in the Academy.\n\nNumenius continues the line of Eudorus and especially Moderatus of\nGadeira (1st c. CE), who also considered Plato to be a\nPythagorean in his philosophical commitments. But unlike Moderatus\n(Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras 53) and other Pythagoreans (see\ne.g. Photius, Bibliotheca cod. 249, 438b14\u201319) who\nconsidered also later philosophers, such as Aristotle, as\nPythagoreans, Numenius apparently maintains that nobody after Plato\nhad access to the Pythagorean wisdom. This tension among Pythagoreans\nis indicative of a vivid debate they were having about the sources on\nwhich one can rely for the reconstruction of Pythagorean\nphilosophy. This debate in turn is characterestic of a strong revival\nof the Pythagorean philosophy in the first two centuries CE. This\nrevival becomes manifest in a series of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha of\nthe same age. These are treatises which pass themselves off as written\nin ancient times and as communicating Pythagorean lore (see Centrone\n1990). It can also be seen in the attempt of Moderatus to present\nPythagorean doctrines systematically in his Pythagorean\nteachings (Pythagorikai scholai; Stephanus of Byzantius\ns.v. Gadeira, and Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras 48;\nKaramanolis 2006, 132\u2013134).\n\nThe stress on Plato's Pythagoreanism on the part of Pythagoreans\nrevives and extends connections between Plato's metaphysics and\nPythagorean ideas noted already by Plato's younger associates.\nAlready Aristotle saw these connections (e.g. Metaphysics\nA.6, M.3, N.3). That early Academics like Xenocrates showed strong\ninterest in Pythagoras' doctrines is presumably because they took them\nto be present in, or close to, Plato\u2019s. They even wrote\ntreatises on them (e.g. Diogenes Laertius IV.13). We hear that Plato\nwas accused of having copied the Timaeus from Philolaus' book\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII.85) and in the 3rd c. BCE Timon of\nPhlius parodied Plato for this (Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae\nIII.17.4). The renewed emphasis on the Timaeus in the work of\nPlatonists of the first centuries CE, which we can attribute already\nto Eudorus (see Dillon 1977, 117\u2013121), is closely associated\nwith the revival of Pythagorean Platonism. Platonists considered\nthe Timaeus to communicate Pythagorean doctrine and even\nargued that it was inspired by the work of \u201cTimaeus\nLocrus\u201d, a late forgery in pseudo-Doric dialect (cf. Proclus, In\nTimaeum I.7.17-8.29).  Numenius is following ample precedent in\nassigning a central role to the Timaeus for deriving a system\nof first principles on the basis of Plato's metaphysics (Baltes 1975,\n241\u2013242). His interest in numbers (he wrote a work on numbers),\nto which he assigns an ontological role (fr. 2.20-24) may well be for\nhim another Pythagorean doctrine that Plato had taken over (see Staab\n2002, 99\u2013100).\n",
