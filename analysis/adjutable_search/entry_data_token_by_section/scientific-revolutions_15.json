    "main_text": "Other Revolution Claims and Examples\n6. Other Revolution Claims and Examples\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (1861) remarked that \u201cRevolutions\nnever follow precedents nor furnish them.\u201d Given the\nunpredictability, the nonlinearity, the seeming uniqueness of\nrevolutions, whether political or scientific, it is therefore\nsurprising to find Thomas Kuhn attempting to provide a General Theory\nof Scientific Revolutions (Kindi 2005). Early Kuhn did seem to believe\nthat there is a single, underlying pattern to the development of\nmature sciences that is key to their success, and late Kuhn a\ndifferent pattern. Has either early or late Kuhn found such a pattern,\nor has he imposed his own philosophical structure on the vagaries and\nvicissitudes of history? Kuhn\u2019s Kantianism always did live in\ntension with his historicism, and in his late work (e.g., 2000c) he\nsurprisingly gave up the pretense of deriving his pattern of taxonomic\nchange and speciation from history of science, on the ground that it\nlargely followed \u201cfrom first principles.\u201d\n\nNumerous philosophers, scientists, and other commentators have made\nclaims about scientific change that differ from Kuhn\u2019s. (For a\nrecent selection see Soler et al. 2008.) Some, as we have seen, are\nskeptical of revolution talk altogether, others of Kuhn\u2019s in\nparticular. Still others accept that some revolutions are Kuhnian but\ndeny that all of them are. One common criticism is that not all\nrevolutionary advances are preceded by an acute crisis, that is, by\nmajor failures of preceding research. Kuhn himself allowed for\nexceptions already in Structure. Another is that\nrevolutionary changes need not involve discontinuities in all of\nKuhn\u2019s levels at once (especially Laudan 1984). Yet another is\nthat there need be little logical or linguistic discontinuity. A\nrapid, seemingly transformative change in research practices may\ninvolve simply a marked gain in data accessibility or accuracy or\ncomputational processing ability via new instrumentation or\nexperimental design. And on the later Kuhn\u2019s own view,\nrevolution need not be a game of creative destruction. Only a few\nexamples can be considered here.\n",
