    "main_text": "The Role of Bayes' Theorem in Subjectivist Accounts of Evidence\n3. The Role of Bayes' Theorem in Subjectivist Accounts of Evidence\n\n\nSubjectivists maintain that beliefs come in varying gradations of\nstrength, and that an ideally rational person's graded beliefs can be\nrepresented by a subjective probability function\nP. For each hypothesis H about which the person has a\nfirm opinion, P(H) measures her level of confidence\n(or \"degree of belief\") in H's\n truth.[6]\n Conditional beliefs are represented by conditional probabilities, so\nthat PE(H) measures the person's\nconfidence in H on the supposition that E is a\n fact.[7]\n\n One of the most influential features of the subjectivist program is\nits account of evidential support. The guiding ideas of this\nBayesian confirmation theory are these:\n\nConfirmational Relativity.  Evidential relationships must\nbe relativized to individuals and their degrees of belief.\nEvidence\n Proportionism.[8]\n A rational believer will proportion her confidence in a hypothesis\nH to her total evidence for H, so that her\nsubjective probability for H reflects the overall balance of\nher reasons for or against its truth.\nIncremental\n Confirmation.[9]\n A body of data provides incremental evidence for H\nto the extent that conditioning on the data raises H's\nprobability.\n\n The first principle says that statements about evidentiary\nrelationships always make implicit reference to people and their\ndegrees of belief, so that, e.g., \"E is evidence for\nH\" should really be read as \"E is evidence for\nH relative to the information encoded in the subjective\nprobability P\".\n\n According to evidence proportionism, a subject's level of confidence\nin H should vary directly with the strength of her evidence\nin favor of H's truth.  Likewise, her level of confidence in\nH conditional on E should vary directly with the\nstrength of her evidence for H's truth when this evidence is\naugmented by the supposition of E.  It is a matter of some\ndelicacy to say precisely what constitutes a person's\n evidence,[10]\n and to explain how her beliefs should be \"proportioned\" to it.\nNevertheless, the idea that incremental evidence is reflected in\ndisparities between conditional and unconditional probabilities only\nmakes sense if differences in subjective probability mirror\ndifferences in total evidence.\n\n An item of data provides a subject with incremental evidence\nfor or against a hypothesis to the extent that receiving the data\nincreases or decreases her total evidence for the truth of the\nhypothesis.  When probabilities measure total evidence, the increment\nof evidence that E provides for H is a matter of the\ndisparity between PE(H) and\nP(H).  When odds are used it is a matter of the\ndisparity between OE(H) and\nO(H). See\n Example 2 in the\nsupplementary document \"Examples, Tables, and Proof Sketches\", which\nillustrates the difference between total and incremental evidence, and\nexplains the \"baserate fallacy\" that can result from failing to\nproperly distinguish the two.\n\n It will be useful to distinguish two subsidiary concepts related to\ntotal evidence.\n\nThe net evidence in favor of H is the degree to which a\nsubject's total evidence in favor of H exceeds her total\nevidence in favor of ~H.\nThe balance of total evidence for H over H* is the degree\nto which a subject's total evidence in favor of H exceeds her\ntotal evidence in favor of H*.\n\n\n The precise content of these notions will depend on how total\nevidence is understood and measured, and on how disparities in total\nevidence are characterized.  For example, if total evidence is given\nin terms of probabilities and disparities are treated as ratios, then\nthe net evidence for H is\nP(H)/P(~H).  If total evidence\nis expressed in terms of odds and differences are used to express\ndisparities, then the net evidence for H will be\nO(H) \u2212 O(~H). Readers may\nconsult Table 3 (in \nthe supplementary document) for a complete list of the possibilities.\n\n As these remarks make clear, one can interpret O(H)\neither as a measure of net evidence or as a measure of total evidence.\nTo see the difference, imagine that 750 red balls and 250 black balls\nhave been drawn at random and with replacement from an urn known to\ncontain 10,000 red or black balls.  Assuming that this is our only\nevidence about the urn's contents, it is reasonable to set\nP(Red) = 0.75 and P(~Red) = 0.25.  On\na probability-as-total-evidence reading, these assignments reflect\nboth the fact that we have a great deal of evidence in favor of\nRed (namely, that 750 of 1,000 draws were red) and the fact\nthat we have also have some evidence against it (namely, that 250 of\nthe draws were black).  The net evidence for Red is\nthen the disparity between our total evidence for Red and our\ntotal evidence against Red.  This can be expressed\nmultiplicatively by saying that we have seen three times as many red\ndraws as black draws, which is just to say that O(Red)\n= 3.  Alternatively, we can use O(Red) as a measure of\nthe total evidence by taking our evidence for Red to be the\nratio of red to black draws, rather than the total number of red\ndraws, and our evidence for ~Red to be the ratio of black\nballs to red balls, rather than the total number of black draws.\nWhile the decision whether to use O as a measure total or net\nevidence makes little difference to questions about the\nabsolute amount of total evidence for a hypothesis (since\nO(H) is an increasing function of\nP(H)), it can make a major difference when one is\nconsidering the incremental changes in total evidence brought\nabout by conditioning on new information.\n\n Philosophers interested in characterizing correct patterns of\ninductive reasoning and in providing \"rational reconstructions\" of\nscientific methodology have tended to focus on incremental evidence as\ncrucial to their enterprise.  When scientists (or ordinary folk) say\nthat E supports or confirms H what they generally\nmean is that learning of E's truth will increase the total\namount of evidence for H's truth.  Since subjectivists\ncharacterize total evidence in terms of subjective probabilities or\nodds, they analyze incremental evidence in terms of changes in these\nquantities.  On such views, the simplest way to characterize the\nstrength of incremental evidence is by making ordinal comparisons of\nconditional and unconditional probabilities or odds.\n\n\n\n(2.1)\nA Comparative Account of Incremental Evidence.\n\n\n \nRelative to a subjective probability function P,\n \nE incrementally confirms (disconfirms, is irrelevant to)\nH if and only if PE(H) is\ngreater than (less than, equal to) P(H).\nH receives a greater increment (or lesser decrement) of\nevidential support from E than from E* if and only\nif PE(H) exceeds\nPE*(H).\n\n\n\n\n\n Both these equivalences continue to hold with probabilities replaced\nby odds.  So, this part of the subjectivist theory of evidence does\nnot depend on how total evidence is measured.\n\n Bayes' Theorem helps to illuminate the content of (2.1) by making it\nclear that E's status as incremental evidence for H\nis enhanced to the extent that H predicts E.  This\nobservation serves as the basis for the following conclusions about\nincremental confirmation (which hold so long as 1  > \nP(H), P(E)  >  0).\n\n\n\n(2.1a)\u00a0\n\u00a0If E incrementally confirms\nH, then H incrementally confirms E.\n\n\n(2.1b)\u00a0\n\u00a0If E incrementally confirms\nH, then E incrementally disconfirms\n~H.\n\n\n(2.1c)\u00a0 \u00a0If H entails E, then E\nincrementally confirms H.\n\n\n(2.1d)\u00a0\n\u00a0If PH(E) =\nPH(E*), then H receives\nmore incremental support from E than from E* if and\nonly if E is unconditionally less probable than\nE*.\n\n\n(2.1e)\u00a0\n\u00a0Weak Likelihood Principle.\nE provides incremental evidence for H if and only if\nPH(E) >\nP~H(E).  More generally, if\nPH(E) >\nPH*(E) and\nP~H(~E) \u2265\nP~H*(~E), then E provides\nmore incremental evidence for H than for H*.\n\n\n\n\n (2.1a) tells us that incremental confirmation is a matter of\nmutual reinforcement: a person who sees E as\nevidence for H invests more confidence in the possibility\nthat both propositions are true than in either possibility in which\nonly one obtains.\n\n (2.1b) says that relevant evidence must be capable of discriminating\nbetween the truth and falsity of the hypothesis under test.\n\n (2.1c) provides a subjectivist rationale for the\nhypothetico-deductive model of confirmation. According to\nthis model, hypotheses are incrementally confirmed by any evidence\nthey entail.  While subjectivists reject the idea that evidentiary\nrelations can be characterized in a belief-independent manner \u2014\nBayesian confirmation is always relativized to a person and\nher subjective probabilities \u2014 they seek to preserve the basic\ninsight of the H-D model by pointing out that hypotheses are\nincrementally supported by evidence they entail for anyone who has\nnot already made up her mind about the hypothesis or the\nevidence.  More precisely, if H entails E, then\nPE(H) =\nP(H)/P(E), which exceeds\nP(H) whenever 1 > P(E),\nP(H) > 0.  This explains why scientists so often\nseek to design experiments that fit the H-D paradigm.  Even when\nevidentiary relations are relativized to subjective probabilities,\nexperiments in which the hypothesis under test entails the data will\nbe regarded as evidentially relevant by anyone who has not\nyet made up his mind about the hypothesis or the data. The\ndegree of incremental confirmation will vary among people\ndepending on their prior levels of confidence in H and\nE , but everyone will agree that the data incrementally\nsupports the hypothesis to at least some degree.\n \n Subjectivists invoke (2.1d) to explain why scientists so often regard\nimprobable or surprising evidence as having more confirmatory\npotential than evidence that is antecedently known. While it is not\ntrue in general that improbable evidence has more confirming\npotential, it is true that E's incremental confirming power\nrelative to H varies inversely with E's\nunconditional probability when the value of the inverse\nprobability PH(E) is held\nfixed.  If H entails both E and E*,\nsay, then Bayes' Theorem entails that the least probable of the two\nsupports H more strongly.  For example, even if heart attacks\nare invariably accompanied by severe chest pain and shortness of\nbreath, the former symptom is far better evidence for a heart attack\nthan the latter simply because severe chest pain is so much less\ncommon than shortness of breath.\n\n (2.1e) captures one core message of Bayes' Theorem for theories of\nconfirmation.  Let's say that H is uniformly better\nthan H* as predictor of E's truth-value when (a)\nH predicts E more strongly than H* does,\nand (b) ~H predicts ~E more strongly than\n~H* does.  According to the weak likelihood principle,\nhypotheses that are uniformly better predictors of the data are better\nsupported by the data.  For example, the fact that little Johnny is a\nChristian is better evidence for thinking that his parents are\nChristian than for thinking that they are Hindu because (a) a far\nhigher proportion of Christian parents than Hindu have Christian\nchildren, and (b) a far higher proportion of non-Christian parents\nthan non-Hindu parents have non-Christian children.\n\n Bayes' Theorem can also be used as the basis for developing and\nevaluating quantitative measures of evidential support. The\nresults listed in Table 2 entail that all four of the functions\nPR, OR, PD and\nOD agree with one another on the simplest question of\nconfirmation: Does E provide incremental evidence for\nH?\n\n\n\n(2.2)\nCorollary.\n\n\n \nEach of the following is equivalent to the assertion\nthat E provides incremental evidence in favor of H:\nPR(H, E) > 1,\nOR(H, E) > 1,\nPD(H, E) > 0,\nOD(H, E) > 0.\n\n\n\n\n Thus, all four measures agree with the comparative account of\nincremental evidence given in (2.1).\n\n Given all this agreement it should not be surprising that\nPR(H, E),\nOR(H, E) and\nPD(H, E), have all been proposed as\nmeasures of the degree of incremental support that E\nprovides for\n H.[11]\n While OD(H, E) has not been\nsuggested for this purpose, we will consider it for reasons of\nsymmetry.  Some authors maintain that one or another of these\nfunctions is the unique correct measure of incremental evidence;\nothers think it best to use a variety of measures that capture\ndifferent evidential relationships.  While this is not the place to\nadjudicate these issues, we can look to Bayes' Theorem for help in\nunderstanding what the various functions measure and in characterizing\nthe formal relationships among them.\n\n All four measures agree in their conclusions about the\ncomparative amount of incremental evidence that different\nitems of data provide for a fixed hypothesis.  In particular,\nthey agree ordinally about the following concepts derived from\nincremental evidence:\n\nThe effective increment of\n evidence[12]\n that E provides for H is the amount by which the\nincremental evidence that E provides for H exceeds\nthe incremental evidence that ~E provides for H.\n\nThe differential in the incremental evidence that\nE and E* provide for H is the amount by\nwhich the incremental evidence that E provides for H\nexceeds the incremental evidence that E* provides for\nH.\n\n\n Effective evidence is a matter of the degree to which a person's\ntotal evidence for H depends on her opinion about E.\nWhen PE(H) and\nP~E(H) (or\nOE(H) and\nO~E(H)) are far apart the person's\nbelief about E has a great effect on her belief about\nH: from her point of view, a great deal hangs on E's\ntruth-value when it comes to questions about H's truth-value.\nA large differential in incremental evidence between E and\nE* tells us that learning E increases the subject's\ntotal evidence for H by a larger amount than learning\nE* does.  Readers may consult\n Table 4 (in the\nsupplement) for quantitative measures of effective and\ndifferential evidence.\n\n The second clause of (2.1) tells us that E provides more\nincremental evidence than E* does for H just in case\nthe probability of H conditional on E exceeds the\nprobability of H conditional on E*.  It is then a\nsimple step to show that all four measures of incremental support\nagree ordinally on questions of effective evidence and of\ndifferentials in incremental evidence.\n\n\n\n(2.3)\nCorollary.\n\n\n \nFor any H, E* and E with\npositive probability, the following are equivalent:\n \nE provides more incremental evidence than E*\ndoes for H\nPR(H, E) >\nPR(H, E*)\nOR(H, E) >\nOR(H, E*)\nPD(H, E) >\nPD(H, E*)\nOD(H, E) >\nOD(H, E*)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The four measures of incremental support can disagree over the\ncomparative degree to which a single item of data\nincrementally confirms two distinct hypotheses. \n Example 3,\n Example 4, and\n Example 5\n (in the supplement) show the various ways in which this\ncan happen.\n\n All the differences between the measures have ultimately to do with\n(a) whether the total evidence in favor of a hypothesis\nshould be measured in terms of probabilities or in terms of odds, and\n(b) whether disparities in total evidence are best captured\nas ratios or as differences.  Rows in the following table correspond\nto different measures of total evidence.  Columns correspond to\ndifferent ways of treating disparities.\n\n\nTable 5: Four measures of incremental evidence\n\n\n\nRatio\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\nP = Total\n\nPR(H, E) =\n PE(H)/P(H)\n\n\nPD(H, E)\n= PE(H) \u2212\nP(H)\n\n\n\nO = Total\n\nOR(H, E) =\n OE(H)/O(H)\n\n\nOD(H, E)\n= OE(H) \u2212\nO(H)\n\n\n\n\n Similar tables can be constructed for measures of net evidence and\nmeasures of balances in total evidence.  See\n Table 5A in the supplement.\n\n We can use the various forms of Bayes' Theorem to clarify the\nsimilarities and differences among these measures by rewriting each of\nthem in terms of likelihood ratios.\n\n\nTable 6: The four measures expressed in terms of\nlikelihood ratios\n\n\n\nRatio\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\nP = Total\n\nPR(H, E) =\nLR(H, T;\nE)\n\nPD(H, E) =\nP(H)[LR(H, T;\nE) \u2212 1]\n\n\nO = Total\n\nOR(H, E) =\nLR(H, ~H; E)\n\nOD(H, E)=\nO(H)[LR(H, ~H;\nE) \u2212 1]\n\n\n\n\n This table shows that there are two differences between each\nmultiplicative measure and its additive counterpart.  First, the\nlikelihood term that appears in a given multiplicative measure is\ndiminished by 1 in its associated additive measure.  Second, in each\nadditive measure the diminished likelihood term is multiplied by an\nexpression for H's probability: P(H) or\nO(H), as the case may be.  The first difference\nmarks no distinction; it is due solely to the fact that the\nmultiplicative and additive measures employ a different zero point\nfrom which to measure evidence.  If we settle on the point of\nprobabilistic independence PE(H) =\nP(H) as a natural common zero, and so subtract 1 from\neach multiplicative\n measure,[13]\n then equivalent likelihood terms appear in both columns.\n\n The real difference between the measures in a given row concerns the\neffect of unconditional probabilities on relations of incremental\nconfirmation.  Down the right column, the degree to which E\nprovides incremental evidence for H is directly proportional\nto H's probability expressed in units of\nP(T) or P(~H).  In the left\ncolumn, H's probability makes no difference to the amount of\nincremental evidence that E provides for H once\nPH(E) and either\nP(E) or P~H(E) are\n fixed.[14]\n In light of Bayes' Theorem, then, the difference between the ratio\nmeasures and then difference measures boils down to one question:\n\nDoes a given piece of data provide a greater increment of\nevidential support for a more probable hypothesis than it does for a\nless probable hypothesis when both hypotheses predict the data equally\nwell?\n\nThe difference measures answer yes, the ratio measures answer no.\n\n Bayes' Theorem can also help us understand the difference between\nrows.  The measures within a given row agree about the role of\npredictability in incremental confirmation.  In the top row\nthe incremental evidence that E provides for H\nincreases linearly with\nPH(E)/P(E),\nwhereas in the bottom row it increases linearly with\nPH(E)/P~H(E).\nThus, when probabilities measure total evidence what matters is the\ndegree to which H exceeds T as a predictor of\nE, but when odds measure total evidence it is the degree to\nwhich H exceeds ~H as a predictor of E that\nmatters.\n\n The central issue here concerns the status of the likelihood ratio.\nWhile everyone agrees that it should play a leading role in any\nquantitative theory of evidence, there are conflicting views about\nprecisely what evidential relationship it captures.  There are three\npossible interpretations.\n\n\nTable 7: Three interpretations of the likelihood\nratio\n\nProbability as total evidence reading\n\n\nPR(H, E) measures incremental\nchange in total evidence.\nLR(H, E) measures incremental\nchange in net evidence.\nLR(H, H*, E) measures\nincremental change in the balance of evidence that E provides\nfor H over H*\n\n\n\n\nOdds as total evidence reading\n\n\nLR(H, E) measures incremental\nchanges in total evidence.\nLR(H, E)2 measures\nincremental change in net evidence.\nLR(H, H*;\nE)/LR(~H, ~H*;\nE) measures incremental change in the balance of evidence\nthat E provides for H over H*.\n\n\n\n\n\"Likelihoodist\" reading\n\n\nNeither P nor O measures total evidence because\nevidential relations are essentially comparative; they always\ninvolve the balance of evidence.\nLR(H, E) measures the balance\nof evidence that E provides for H over\nH*.\nLR(H, H*; E) measures\nthe balance of evidence that E provides for H over\nH*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n On the first reading there is no conflict whatsoever between using\nprobability ratios and using likelihood ratios to measure evidence.\nOnce we get clear on the distinctions between total evidence, net\nevidence and the balance of evidence, we see that each of\nPR(H, E),\nLR(H, E) and\nLR(H, H*; E) measures an\nimportant evidential relationship, but that the relationships they\nmeasure are importantly different.\n\n When odds measure total evidence neither\nPR(H, E) nor\nLR(H, H*; E) plays a\nfundamental role in the theory of evidence.  Changes in the\nprobability ratio for H given E only indicate\nchanges in incremental evidence in the presence of information about\nchanges in the probability ratio for ~H given E.\nLikewise, changes in the likelihood ratio for H and\nH* given E only indicate changes in the balance of\nevidence in light of information about changes in the likelihood ratio\nfor ~H and ~H* given E.  Thus, while each\nof the two functions can figure as one component in a meaningful\nmeasure of confirmation, neither tells us anything about incremental\nevidence when taken by itself.\n\n The third view, \"likelihoodism,\" is popular among non-Bayesian\nstatisticians.  Its proponents deny evidence proportionism.  They\nmaintain that a person's subjective probability for a hypothesis\nmerely reflects her degree of uncertainty about its truth; it need not\nbe tied in any way to the amount of evidence she has in its\n favor.[15]\n It is likelihood ratios, not subjective probabilities, which capture\nthe \"scientifically meaningful\" evidential relations.  Here are two\nclassic statements of the position.\n\n All the information which the data provide concerning the relative\nmerits of two hypotheses is contained in the likelihood ratio of the\nhypotheses on the data.  (Edwards 1972, 30)\n\n\n The \u2018evidential meaning\u2019 of experimental results is characterized\nfully by the likelihood function\u2026 Reports of experimental results in\nscientific journals should in principle be descriptions of likelihood\nfunctions. (Brinbaum 1962, 272)\n\n\n On this view, everything that can be said about the evidential import\nof E for H is embodied in the following\ngeneralization of the weak likelihood principle:\n\nThe \"Law of Likelihood\".  If H implies that the\nprobability of E is x, while H* implies\nthat the probability of E is x*, then E is\nevidence supporting H over H* if and only if\nx exceeds x*, and the likelihood ratio,\nx/x*, measures the strength of this support.\n(Hacking 1965, 106-109), (Royall 1997, 3)\n \n\n The biostatistician Richard Royall is a particularly lucid defender\nof likelihoodism (Royall 1997).  He maintains that any scientifically\nrespectable concept of evidence must analyze the evidential impact of\nE on H solely in terms of likelihoods; it should not\nadvert to anyone's unconditional probabilities for E or\nH.  This is supposed to be because likelihoods are both\nbetter known and more objective than unconditional probabilities.\nRoyall argues strenuously against the idea that incremental evidence\ncan be measured in terms of the disparity between unconditional and\nconditional probabilities.  Here is the gist of his complaint:\n\n Whereas [LR(H, H*; E)]\nmeasures the support for one hypothesis H relative to a\nspecific alternative H*, without regard either to the prior\nprobabilities of the two hypotheses or to what other hypotheses might\nalso be considered, the law of changing probability [as measured by\nPR(H, E)] measures support for\nH relative to a specific prior distribution over H\nand its alternatives... The law of changing probability is of limited\nusefulness in scientific discourse because of its dependence on the\nprior probability distribution, which is generally unknown and/or\npersonal.  Although you and I agree (on the basis of the law of\nlikelihood) that given evidence supports H over H*,\nand H** over both H and H*, we might\ndisagree about whether it is evidence supporting H (on the\nbasis of the law of changing probability) purely on the basis of our\ndifferent judgments of the priori probability of H,\nH*, and H**.  (Royall 1997, 10-11, with slight\nchanges in notation)\n \n Royall's point is that neither the probability ratio nor probability\ndifference will capture the sort of objective evidence required by\nscience because their values depend on the \"subjective\" terms\nP(E) and P(H), and not just on the\n\"objective\" likelihoods PH(E) and\nP~H(E).\n\n Whether one agrees with this assessment will be a matter of\nphilosophical temperament, in particular of one's willingness to\ntolerate subjective probabilities in one's account of evidential\nrelations.  It will also depend crucially on the extent to which one\nis convinced that likelihoods are better known and more objective than\nordinary subjective probabilities.  Cases like the one envisioned in\nthe law of likelihood, where hypotheses deductively entails a\ndefinite probability for the data, are relatively rare.  So, unless\none is willing to adopt a theory of evidence with a very restricted\nrange of application, a great deal will turn on how easy it is to\ndetermine objective likelihoods in situations where the predictive\nconnection from hypothesis to data is itself the result of\ninductive inferences.  However one comes down on these\nissues, though, there is no denying that likelihood ratios will play a\ncentral role in any probabilistic account of evidence.\n\n In fact, the weak likelihood principle (2.1e) encapsulates a minimal\nform of Bayesianism to which all parties can agree.  This is clearest\nwhen it is restated in terms of likelihoods.\n\n\n\n(2.1e)\u00a0\nThe Weak Likelihood Principle. (expressed in\nterms of likelihood ratios)\n\n\n \nIf LR(H, H*; E)\n\u2265 1 and LR(~H, ~H*;\n~E) \u2265 1, with one inequality strict, then E\nprovides more incremental evidence for H than for H*\nand ~E provides more incremental evidence for ~H\nthan for ~H*.\n\n\n\n\n Likelihoodists will endorse (2.1e) because the relationships\ndescribed in its antecedent depend only on inverse probabilities.\nProponents of both the \"probability\" and \"odds\" interpretations of\ntotal evidence will accept (2.1e) because satisfaction of its\nantecedent ensures that conditioning on E increases\nH's probability and its odds strictly more than those of\nH*.  Indeed, the weak likelihood principle must be an\nintegral part of any account of evidential relevance that deserves the\ntitle \"Bayesian\".  To deny it is to misunderstand the central message\nof Bayes' Theorem for questions of evidence: namely, that hypotheses\nare confirmed by data they predict.  As we shall see in the next\nsection, this \"minimal\" form of Bayesianism figures importantly into\nsubjectivist models of learning from experience.\n",
