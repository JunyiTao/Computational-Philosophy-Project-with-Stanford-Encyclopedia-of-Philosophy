Sufficient Conditions for Using Others Merely as Means\n\nMuch debate concerning what it means to treat others merely as means\nstems from a single passage in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics\nof Morals. Kant is attempting to demonstrate that the Formula of\nHumanity generates a duty not to make false promises:\n\n\nHe who has it in mind to make a false promise to others sees at once\nthat he wants to make use of another human being merely as a\nmeans, without the other at the same time containing in himself\nthe end. For, he whom I want to use for my purposes by such a promise\ncannot possibly agree to my way of behaving toward him, and so himself\ncontain the end of this action. (1785: 429\u2013430)\n\n\nIn these brief remarks, Kant hints at various ways in which we might\nunderstand conditions for treating another merely as a means. We might\nunderstand them in terms of the other\u2019s inability to share the\nagent\u2019s end in using him or to consent to her using him, for\nexample. In this section, we discuss elaborations of these ways (and\nothers) of formulating sufficient conditions for someone who is using\nanother to be treating this other merely as a means.\n",
