    "main_text": "\n\nMeasurement is an integral part of modern science as well as of\nengineering, commerce, and daily life. Measurement is often considered\na hallmark of the scientific enterprise and a privileged source of\nknowledge relative to qualitative modes of\n inquiry.[1]\n Despite its ubiquity and importance, there is little consensus among\nphilosophers as to how to define measurement, what sorts of things are\nmeasurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. Most (but\nnot all) contemporary authors agree that measurement is an activity\nthat involves interaction with a concrete system with the aim of\nrepresenting aspects of that system in abstract terms (e.g., in terms\nof classes, numbers, vectors etc.) But this characterization also fits\nvarious kinds of perceptual and linguistic activities that are not\nusually considered measurements, and is therefore too broad to count\nas a definition of measurement. Moreover, if \u201cconcrete\u201d\nimplies \u201creal\u201d, this characterization is also too narrow,\nas measurement often involves the representation of ideal systems such\nas the average household or an electron at complete rest.\n\nPhilosophers have written on a variety of conceptual, metaphysical,\nsemantic and epistemological issues related to measurement. This entry\nwill survey the central philosophical standpoints on the nature of\nmeasurement, the notion of measurable quantity and related\nepistemological issues. It will refrain from elaborating on the many\ndiscipline-specific problems associated with measurement and focus on\nissues that have a general character.\n",
