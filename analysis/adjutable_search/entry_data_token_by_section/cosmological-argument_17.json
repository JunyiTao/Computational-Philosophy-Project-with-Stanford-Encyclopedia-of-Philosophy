    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || Personal Explanation\n7.6 Personal Explanation\n\nFinally, something needs to be said about\n premise 3\n and\n conclusion 5,\n which asserts that the cause of the universe is personal. Defenders\nof the cosmological argument suggest two possible kinds of\n explanation.[3]\nNatural explanation is provided in terms of precedent\nevents, causal laws, or necessary conditions that invoke natural\nexistents. Personal explanation is given \u201cin terms of\nthe intentional action of a rational agent\u201d (Swinburne 2004: 21;\nalso Gale and Pruss 1999). We have seen that one cannot provide a\nnatural causal explanation for the initial event, for there are no\nprecedent natural events or natural existents to which the laws of\nphysics apply. The line of scientific explanation runs out at the\ninitial singularity, and perhaps even before we arrive at the initial\nsingularity (at \\(10^{-35}\\) seconds). If no scientific explanation\n(in terms of physical laws) can provide a causal account of the origin\nof the universe (premise 4), the explanation must be personal, that\nis, in terms of the intentional action of an intelligent, supernatural\nagent.\n\nMorriston (2000: 163\u201368) questions whether Craig\u2019s\nargument for the cause being personal goes through. Craig argues that\nif the cause were an eternal, nonpersonal, operating set of\nconditions, then the universe would exist from eternity. Below\nfreezing temperatures will always freeze whatever water is present.\nSince the universe has not existed from eternity, the cause must be a\npersonal agent who chooses freely to create an effect in time.\nHowever, notes Morriston, if the personal cause intended from eternity\nto create the world, and if the intention alone to create is causally\nsufficient to bring about the effect, then the universe would also\nexist from eternity, and there would be no reason to prefer a personal\ncause of the universe over a nonpersonal cause. For a timeless eternal\nbeing before creation, which is Craig\u2019s view, \u201cThere can\nbe no temporal gap between the time at which it does the willing and\nthe time at which the thing willed actually happens\u201d (2000,\n167). So the distinction in this respect between a personal and a\nnonpersonal eternal cause disappears. Craig (2002) replies that it is\nnot intention alone that must be present, but the personal agent must\nalso employ or exercise its personal causal power to bring about the\nworld. However, Morriston retorts, exercising personal causal power is\nan action in time, a view that is unavailable to Craig, for there is\nno time when God would restrain his causal powers. \n\nPaul Davies argues that one need not appeal to God to account for the\nBig Bang. Its cause, he suggests, is found within the cosmic system\nitself. Originally a vacuum lacking space-time dimensions, the\nuniverse \u201cfound itself in an excited vacuum state\u201d, a\n\u201cferment of quantum activity, teeming with virtual particles and\nfull of complex interactions\u201d (Davies 1984: 191\u201392),\nwhich, subject to a cosmic repulsive force, resulted in an immense\nincrease in energy. Subsequent explosions from this collapsing vacuum\nreleased the energy in this vacuum, reinvigorating the cosmic\ninflation and setting the scenario for the subsequent expansion of the\nuniverse. However, what is the origin of this increase in energy that\neventually made the Big Bang possible? Davies\u2019s response is that\nthe law of conservation of energy (that the total quantity of energy\nin the universe remains fixed despite transfer from one form to\nanother), which now applies to our universe, did not apply to the\ninitial expansion. Cosmic repulsion in the vacuum caused the energy to\nincrease from zero to an enormous amount. This great explosion\nreleased energy, from which all matter emerged. Consequently, he\ncontends, since the conclusion of the kal\u0101m argument is\nfalse, one of the premises of the argument\u2014in all likelihood the\nfirst\u2014is false.\n\nCraig responds that if the vacuum has energy, the question arises\nconcerning the origin of the vacuum and its energy. Merely pushing the\nquestion of the beginning of the universe back to some primordial\nquantum vacuum does not escape the question of what brought this\nvacuum laden with energy into existence. A quantum vacuum is not\nnothing (as in Newtonian physics) but \n\n\na sea of continually forming and dissolving particles that borrow\nenergy from the vacuum for their brief existence. A quantum vacuum is\nthus far from nothing, and vacuum fluctuations do not constitute an\nexception to the principle that whatever beings to exist has a cause.\n(Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 143\u201344)\n\n\nHence, he concludes, the appeal to a vacuum as the initial state is\nmisleading.\n\nOne might wonder, as Rundle (2004: 75\u201377) does, how a\nsupernatural agent could bring about the universe. He contends that a\npersonal agent (God) cannot be the cause because intentional agency\nneeds a body and actions occur within space-time. However, acceptance\nof the cosmological argument does not depend on an explanation of the\nmanner of causation by a necessary being. When we explain that the\ngirl raised her hand because she wanted to ask a question, we can\naccept that she was the cause of the raised hand without understanding\nhow her wanting to ask a question brought about her raising her hand.\nAs Swinburne notes, an event is \u201cfully explained when we have\ncited the agent, his intention that the event occur, and his basic\npowers\u201d that include the ability to bring about events of that\nsort (2004: 36). Similarly, theists argue, we may never know why and\nhow creation took place. Nevertheless, we may accept it as an\nexplanation in the sense that we can say that God created that initial\nevent, that he had the intention to do so, and that such an event lies\nwithin the power of an omniscient and almighty being; not having a\nbody is irrelevant.\n\nThe issues raised by the kal\u0101m argument concern not only\nthe nature of explanation and when an explanation is necessary, but\neven whether an explanation of the universe is possible (given the\nabove discussion). Whereas all agree that it makes no sense to ask\nabout what occurs before the Big Bang (since there was no prior time)\nor about something coming out of nothing, the dispute rests on whether\nthere needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether\nsomething like the universe can be finite and yet not have a\nbeginning, and crucially the nature of infinities and their connection\nwith reality.\n",
