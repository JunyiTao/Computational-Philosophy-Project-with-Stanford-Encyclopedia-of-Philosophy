    "main_text": "\n\n\nPractical reason is the general human capacity for resolving, through\nreflection, the question of what one is to do. Deliberation of this\nkind is practical in at least two senses. First, it is practical in\nits subject matter, insofar as it is concerned with action. But it is\nalso practical in its consequences or its issue, insofar as reflection\nabout action itself directly moves people to act.  Our capacity for\ndeliberative self-determination raises two sets of philosophical\nproblems.  First, there are questions about how deliberation can\nsucceed in being practical in its issue. What do we need to\nassume\u2014both about agents and about the processes of reasoning\nthey engage in\u2014to make sense of the fact that deliberative\nreflection can directly give rise to action? Can we do justice to this\ndimension of practical reason while preserving the idea that practical\ndeliberation is genuinely a form of reasoning? Second, there are large\nissues concerning the content of the standards that are brought to\nbear in practical reasoning.  Which norms for the assessment of action\nare binding on us as agents? Do these norms provide resources for\ncritical reflection about our ends, or are they exclusively\ninstrumental? Under what conditions do moral norms yield valid\nstandards for reasoning about action? The first set of issues is\naddressed in sections 1\u20133 of the present article, while sections\n4\u20135 cover the second set of issues. \n",
