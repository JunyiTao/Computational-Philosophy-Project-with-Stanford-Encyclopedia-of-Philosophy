Rather,\naccording to Burge, we are entitled to these beliefs. \n\u201c[w]e are entitled to rely, other things equal, on perception,\nmemory, deductive and inductive reasoning, and on\u2026the word of\nothers\u201d (1993, p. 458). Beliefs in which a believer is\nentitled are those that are unsupported by evidence available to the\nbeliever, but which the believer is nevertheless warranted in\nbelieving.\n\n\nSome work in EOCS has developed analogies between computer\nsimulation and the kinds of knowledge producing practices Burge\nassociates with entitlement. (See especially Barberousse\nand Vorms, 2014, and Beisbart, 2017.) This is, in some ways, a\nnatural outgrowth of Burge\u2019s arguments that we view computer\nassisted proofs in this way (1998). Computer simulations\nare extremely complex, often the result of the epistemic labor of a\ndiverse set of scientists and other experts, and perhaps most\nimportantly, epistemically opaque (Humphreys, 2004).  Because of\nthese features, Beisbart argues that it is reasonable to treat computer\nsimulations in the same way that we treat our senses and the testimony\nof others: simply as things that can be trusted on the assumption\nthat everything is working smoothly. (Beisbart,\n2017). \n\n\nSymons and Alvarado (2019) argue that there is a fundamental problem\nwith this approach to EOCS and it has to do with a feature of\ncomputer-aided proof that was crucial to Burge\u2019s original\naccount: that of a being a \u2018transparent conveyor\u2019.\n\u201cIt is very important to note, for example, that Burge\u2019s\naccount of content preservation and transparent conveying requires\nthat the recipient already has reason not to doubt the source\u201d\n(p. 13). But Symons and Alvarado point to many of the properties of\ncomputer simulations (drawing from Winsberg 2010 and Ruphy 2015) in\nvirtue of which they fail to have these properties. Lenhard and\nK\u00fcster 2019 is also relevant here, as they argue that there are\nmany features of computer simulation that make them difficult to\nreproduce and that therefore undermine some of the stability that\nwould be required for them to be transparent conveyors. For these\nreasons and others having to do with many of the features discussed in\n4.2 and 4.3, Symons and Alvarado argue that it is implausible that we\nshould view computer simulation as a basic epistemic practice on a par\nwith sense perception, memory, testimony, or the like.\n",
