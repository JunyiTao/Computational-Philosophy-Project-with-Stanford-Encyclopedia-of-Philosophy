Within D3, there are seven\nArguments with the following Conclusions: If the one is, then the\nothers are not the one (D3A1C), the others have parts (D3A2C1), the\nothers are a whole (D3A2C2 and D3A3C2), the others are one (D3A2C3 and\nD3A3C1), the whole and the part of the others are many (D3A4C), the\nwhole and the part of the others are unlimited in multitude (D3A5C1),\nthe whole and the part of the others are unlimited (D3A5C2), the whole\nand the part of the others are limited (D3A6C), each of the others is\nlike itself (D3A7C1), each of the others is like each of the others\nother than itself (D3A7C2), each of the others is unlike itself\n(D3A7C3), and each of the others is unlike each of the others other\nthan itself (D3A7C4). There is also the promise of a number of\nArguments establishing results of the form: If the one is, then the\nothers are both F and con-F.\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D3 are logically interconnected,\nand connected to Arguments within previous Deductions. The only\nexception is D3A2C1, which does not depend on any previously\nestablished Conclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007,\n198\u2013206).)\n\n\nIt appears that every argument of D3 is logically valid. Like the\nArguments of D1 and D2, the Arguments of D3 rest on a number of\nindependent premises, including premises of D1 and D2. Again, it\nappears that the premises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of\nview, either definitionally true or self-evident. Thus it appears\nthat, from Plato\u2019s point of view, D3 establishes, without\nreliance on Purity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption,\nthat if the one is, then the others have a host of contrary\nproperties.\n",
