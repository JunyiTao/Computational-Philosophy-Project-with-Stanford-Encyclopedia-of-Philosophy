    "main_text": "Prison Writings || Ideology and Common Sense\n3.4 Ideology and Common Sense\n\nGramsci\u2019s attention to intellectuals connected to his\nreflections on popular consciousness and its practical organization\nin, for example, religion, education, language, and folklore (see\nFSPN: 1\u2013137, 138\u201360; SPN: 26\u201343; SCW: 167\u201395).\nPopular attitudes, he underlined\u2014drawing on his linguistic\ntraining\u2014should not be dismissed but, rather, understood as part\nof how ordinary people lived and experienced their world (see Ives\n2004). They were also the medium through which hegemony was\nexercised.\n\nThe tendency among Marxists to diminish \u201cideology and\npolitics\u201d, reducing them to an immediate expression of an\neconomic structure, was dismissed by Gramsci as \u201cprimitive\ninfantilism\u201d (SPN: 407). Instead, ideology should be grasped as\na conception of the world that \u201cserves to cement and\nunify\u201d human practice (SPN: 328). It had a lived\n\u201cpsychological\u201d validity that enabled people to become\nconscious of their practical situations, however inadequately (SPN:\n377). It was therefore important to explore and understand that\npractical function. Gramsci did this in his remarks on \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d (senso comune).\n\nCommon sense\u2014popular attitudes and beliefs, frequently accepted\nas \u201ceternal\u201d truths by ordinary people\u2014denoted, for\nGramsci, a largely uncritical and \u201cfragmentary\u201d mode of\nconsciousness (SPN: 419). Consisting of superstitions and forms of\n\u201cfolklore\u201d concerning the nature of reality and ethical\nconduct, common sense was a \u201cphilosophy of the popular\nmasses\u201d, often born from religion, that differentiated\n\u201csimple\u201d folk from educated intellectuals. Its danger was\nthat it tended to invite resignation and passivity rather than\ncollective action. That was a problem for what Gramsci referred to as\n\u201csubaltern\u201d groups\u2014marginalized and subordinate\nclasses such as the peasantry and the proletariat\u2014who, despite\nperiodic rebellions, never adequately challenge dominant classes (see\nGreen 2002). Yet, common sense thinking often had a \u201chealthy\nnucleus\u201d in \u201cgood sense\u201d, that is, in the practical\nand realistic attitudes that could be made \u201cmore coherent and\nunitary\u201d (SPN: 328) if joined to a systematic and critical\nconception of the world. It was necessary not to dismiss common sense\nthinking (nor the struggles of subaltern groups) but to critically\nengage the \u201ccontradictory consciousness\u201d of ordinary\npeople (SPN: 326)\u2014that is, the tendency to hold beliefs\ncontradicted by actual conduct\u2014and educate it.\n\nGramsci understood that educative task to belong to\nintellectuals\u2014not merely to advance a superior and abstract\nphilosophy but to work on common sense, thereby \u201crenovating and\nmaking \u2018critical\u2019 an already existing activity\u201d\n(SPN: 331). A hegemonic worldview had to connect to the\n\u201csimple\u201d to become embedded in everyday life. The past\nsuccess of traditional intellectuals in this regard explained the\nongoing influence of the Catholic Church in Italy.\n",
