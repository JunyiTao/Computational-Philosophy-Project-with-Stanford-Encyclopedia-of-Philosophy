Consequences of Spatial Properties of Diagrams\n\nWhile it is often possible to afford diagrams the same logical status\nas formulae (as argued above), there are still important differences\n(which can have ramifications for correctness of the system) between\ndiagrams and traditional linear proof calculi. An important point to\nnote about diagrams (cf. Russell\n 1923)\n is that spatial relations between objects in a diagram can be used to\nrepresent relations between objects in some other domain. Sequential\nlanguages (e.g., symbolic logics, natural languages), however, use\nonly the relation of concatenation to represent relations between\nobjects. The peculiar representational use of spatial relations in the\ncase of diagrams is direct and intuitive, as seen in the development\nof Euler Diagrams above, but also has its perils\u2014as we shall\ndiscuss. Spatial constraints, being peculiar to diagrammatic systems,\ncan be expected to be an important source of both their strengths and\nweaknesses. Psychological considerations concerning human capacities\nfor visual processing of information, and skill at qualitative spatial\nreasoning, also have ramifications for the effectiveness of reasoning\nwith diagrams, but we shall not survey them here. \n\nA particular distinguishing feature of diagrams is that they obey\ncertain \u201cnomic\u201d or \u201cintrinsic\u201d constraints due\nto their use of plane surfaces as a medium of representation. The idea\nis that sentential languages are based on acoustic signals which are\nsequential in nature, and so must have a compensatingly complex syntax\nin order to express certain relationships\u2014whereas diagrams,\nbeing two-dimensional, are able to display some relationships without\nthe intervention of a complex syntax (Stenning & Lemon\n 2001).\n Diagrams exploit this possibility\u2014the use of spatial relations\nto represent other relations. The question is; how well can spatial\nrelations and objects represent other (possibly more abstract) objects\nand relations?\n\nLogical reasoning with diagrams is often carried out in virtue of\ntheir depiction of all possible models of a situation, up to\ntopological equivalence of the diagrams (this, of course, depends on\nthe particular diagrammatic system in use). A single diagram is often\nan abstraction over a class of situations, and once a suitable diagram\nhas been constructed, inferences can simply be read off the\nrepresentation without any further manipulation. In some diagrammatic\nsystems (e.g., Euler Circles) inference is carried out by constructing\ndiagrams correctly and reading information off them. The complexity of\nusing inference rules in a symbolic logic is, in these cases, replaced\nby the problem of drawing particular diagrams\n correctly.[5]\n For instance, an Euler Circles diagram ventures to capture\nrelationships between sets using topological relationships between\nplane regions in such a way that that it depicts all the possible ways\nthat a certain collection of set-theoretic statements could be true.\nThis has two important consequences: (1) if a certain diagram cannot\nbe drawn then the described situation must be impossible (termed\n\u201cself-consistency\u201d), and (2) if a certain relationship\nbetween diagram objects must be drawn, then the corresponding relation\ncan be inferred as logically valid. (See the numerous examples in\n Section 2.)\n This phenomenon is often termed a \u201cfree-ride\u201d (Barwise\n& Shimojima\n 1995).\n This style of diagrammatic reasoning is thus dependent on a\nparticular representational use of diagrams\u2014that they represent\nclasses of models. If a particular class of models cannot be\nrepresented by a diagrammatic system, then those cases will not be\ntaken into account in inferences using the system, and incorrect\ninferences might be drawn. This fact makes the representational\nadequacy of diagrammatic systems, restricted by their spatial nature,\nof paramount importance, as we shall now explore.\n",
