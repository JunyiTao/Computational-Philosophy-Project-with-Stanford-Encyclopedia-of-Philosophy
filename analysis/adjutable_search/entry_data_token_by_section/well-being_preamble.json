    "main_text": "\n\nWell-being is most commonly used in philosophy to describe what is\nnon-instrumentally or ultimately good for a person. The\nquestion of what well-being consists in is of independent interest,\nbut it is of great importance in moral philosophy, especially in the\ncase of utilitarianism, according to which the only moral requirement\nis that well-being be maximized. Significant challenges to the very\nnotion have been mounted, in particular by G.E. Moore and T.M.\nScanlon. It has become standard to distinguish theories of well-being\nas either hedonist theories, desire theories, or objective list\ntheories. According to the view known as welfarism, well-being is the\nonly value. Also important in ethics is the question of how a\nperson\u2019s moral character and actions relate to their\nwell-being.\n",
