    "main_text": "Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the\nconstructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical\nlogic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real\nnumber equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the\nmathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries\nsuch as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the\nroute taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic\nlogic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible\ndecisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or\ntype-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within\nconstructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the\nnatural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.\n[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges &\nV\u00ee\u021b\u0103 [2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal\nmathematician, the only constraints being those imposed by\nintuitionistic logic. As Bishop and others have shown, the traditional\nbelief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today, that\nintuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the\ndevelopment of serious mathematics impossible, is patently false:\nlarge parts of deep modern mathematics can be, and have been, produced\nby purely constructive methods. Moreover, the link between\nconstructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the\nfuture implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the\ncomputer.\n\nFor further information about the state of modern constructive\nmathematics, we recommend the forthcoming Handbook of Constructive\nMathematics [Bridges et al., eds, 2023].\n",
