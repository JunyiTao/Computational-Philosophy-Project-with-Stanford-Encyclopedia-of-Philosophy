    "main_text": "Some versions of proof-theoretic semantics || Structural characterization of logical constants\n2.4 Structural characterization of logical constants\n\nThere is a large field of ideas and results concerning what might be\ncalled the \u201cstructural characterization\u201d of logical\nconstants, where \u201cstructural\u201d is here meant both in the\nproof-theoretic sense of \u201cstructural rules\u201d and in the\nsense of a framework that bears a certain structure, where this\nframework is again proof-theoretically described. Some of its authors\nuse a semantical vocabulary and at least implicitly suggest that their\ntopic belongs to proof-theoretic semantics. Others explicitly deny\nthese connotations, emphasizing that they are interested in a\ncharacterization which establishes the logicality of a constant. The\nquestion \u201cWhat is a logical constant?\u201d can be answered in\nproof-theoretic terms, even if the semantics of the constants\nthemselves is truth-conditional: Namely by requiring that the (perhaps\ntruth-conditionally defined) constants show a certain inferential\nbehaviour that can be described in proof-theoretic terms. However, as\nsome of the authors consider their characterization at the same time\nas a semantics, it is appropriate that we mention some of these\napproaches here.\n\nThe most outspoken structuralist with respect to logical constants,\nwho explicitly understands himself as such, is Koslow. In his\nStructuralist Theory of Logic (1992) he develops a theory of\nlogical constants, in which he characterizes them by certain\n\u201cimplication relations\u201d, where an implication relation\nroughly corresponds to a finite consequence relation in Tarski\u2019s\nsense (which again can be described by certain structural rules of a\nsequent-style system). Koslow develops a structural theory in the\nprecise metamathematical sense, which does not specify the domain of\nobjects in any way beyond the axioms given. If a language or any other\ndomain of objects equipped with an implication relation is given, the\nstructural approach can be used to single out logical compounds by\nchecking their implicational properties.\n\nIn his early papers on the foundations of logic, Popper (1947a; 1947b;\nBinder et al., eds., 2022) gives inferential characterizations of\nlogical constants in proof-theoretic terms. He uses a calculus of\nsequents and characterizes logical constants by certain derivability\nconditions for such sequents. His terminology clearly suggests that he\nintends a proof-theoretic semantics of logical constants, as he speaks\nof \u201cinferential definitions\u201d and the \u201ctrivialization\nof mathematical logic\u201d achieved by defining constants in the way\ndescribed. Although his presentation is not free from conceptual\nimprecision and error, he anticipated many ideas now common in\nproof-theoretic semantics, such as the delineation of logical\nconstants by means of certain minimality or maximality conditions with\nrespect to introduction or elimination rules.\n\nImportant contributions to the logicality debate that characterize\nlogical constants inferentially in terms of sequent calculus rules are\nthose by Kneale (1956) and Hacking (1979). A thorough account of\nlogicality is proposed by Do\u0161en (1980; 1989) in his theory of\nlogical constants as \u201cpunctuation marks\u201d, expressing\nstructural features at the logical level. He understands logical\nconstants as following certain double-line rules for sequents which\ncan be read in both directions. For example, conjunction and\ndisjunction obey (in classical logic, with multiple-formulae\nsuccedents) the double-line rules \n\\[\n\\xlongequal[{\\Large \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, A \\,\\land\\, B,\\, \\Delta}]\n{{\\Large \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, A,\\, \\Delta\\quad \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, B,\\, \\Delta}}\n\\hspace{2em}\n\\xlongequal[{\\Large \\Gamma,\\, A \\,\\lor\\, B \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta}]\n{{\\Large \\Gamma,\\, A \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta\\quad \\Gamma,\\, B \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta}}\n\\]\n\n\nDo\u0161en is able to give characterizations which include systems\nof modal logic. He explicitly considers his work as a contribution to\nthe logicality debate and not to any conception of proof-theoretic\nsemantics. Sambin et al., in their Basic Logic (Sambin, Battilotti,\nand Faggian, 2000), explicitly understand what Do\u0161en calls\ndouble-line rules as fundamental meaning giving rules. The double-line\nrules for conjunction and disjunction are read as implicit definitions\nof these constants, which by some procedure can be turned into the\nexplicit sequent-style rules we are used to. So Sambin et al. use the\nsame starting point as Do\u0161en, but interpret it not as a\nstructural description of the behaviour of constants, but semantically\nas their implicit definition.\n\nThere are several other approaches to a uniform proof-theoretic\ncharacterization of logical constants, all of which at least touch\nupon issues of proof-theoretic semantics. Such theories are\nBelnap\u2019s Display Logic (Belnap, 1982), Wansing\u2019s Logic of\nInformation Structures (Wansing, 1993b), generic proof editing systems\nand their implementations such as the Edinburgh Logical Framework\n(Harper, Honsell, and Plotkin, 1987) and many successors which allow\nthe specification of a variety of logical systems. Since the rise of\nlinear and, more generally, substructural logics there are various\napproaches dealing with logics that differ with respect to\nrestrictions on their structural rules (see section\n 3.10).\n A recent movement away from singling out a particular logic as the\ntrue one towards a more pluralist stance (see, e.g., Beall and\nRestall, 2006), which is interested in what different logics have in\ncommon without any preference for a particular logic, can be seen as a\nshift away from semantical justification towards structural\ncharacterization.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor Popper\u2019s theory of logical constants see Binder et\nal. (2022), Piecha (2023).\n\nFor logical constants and their logicality see the\nentry on\n logical constants.\n\nFor linear and substructural logics see the entry on\n linear logic,\n and the entry on\n substructural logics.\n\nFor pluralism in logic, see the entry on on\n logical pluralism.\n",
