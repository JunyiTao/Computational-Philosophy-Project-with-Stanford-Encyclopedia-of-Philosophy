    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u201cAffirmative action\u201d means positive steps taken to\nincrease the representation of women and minorities in areas of\nemployment, education, and culture from which they have been\nhistorically excluded. When those steps involve preferential\nselection\u2014selection on the basis of race, gender, or\nethnicity\u2014affirmative action generates intense controversy.\n\n\nThe development, defense, and contestation of preferential affirmative\naction has proceeded along two paths. One has been legal and\nadministrative as courts, legislatures, and executive departments of\ngovernment have made and applied rules requiring affirmative action.\nThe other has been the path of public debate, where the practice of\npreferential treatment has spawned a vast literature, pro and con.\nOften enough, the two paths have failed to make adequate contact, with\nthe public quarrels not always very securely anchored in any existing\nlegal basis or practice.\n\n\nThe ebb and flow of public controversy over affirmative action can\nbe pictured as two spikes on a line, the first spike representing a\nperiod of passionate debate that began around 1972 and tapered off\nafter 1980, and the second indicating a resurgence of debate in the\n1990s leading up to Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in 2003 and 2016\nupholding certain kinds of affirmative action. The first spike\nencompassed controversy about gender and racial preferences alike. This\nis because in the beginning affirmative action was as much about the\nfactory, the firehouse, and the corporate suite as about the college\ncampus. The second spike represents a quarrel about race and ethnicity.\nThis is because the burning issue at the turn of the twentieth-first\ncentury is about college\n admissions. At selective colleges, women\nneed no boost; African-Americans and Hispanics\n do.[1]\n",
