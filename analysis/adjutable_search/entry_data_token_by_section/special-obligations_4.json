    "main_text": "Special Obligations and the Distributive Objection\n5. Special Obligations and the Distributive Objection\n\nFinally, let us return to the second of the objections to special\nobligations, what Scheffler calls \u2018the distributive\nobjection.\u2019 Special obligations are owed to those that we can\nthink of as \u2018insiders\u2019: those to whom promises have been\nmade, members of a given family, citizens of a certain nation, etc. If\nI owe more to my intimates, then, it seems, I am justified in doing\nmore for them than for other persons, even if the latter are more\nneedy than my intimates. This sort of worry is, of course, in part\nwhat motivates a consequentialist theory: no person\u2019s well-being\nis more valuable than that of any other person, and so we are\nunjustified in failing to be impartial between intimates and\nstrangers. Whereas there may be good consequentialist reasons for\nacting as though we have special obligations, as we have seen, the\nconsequentialist (and any other defender of the distributive\nobjection) will insist that a commitment to genuinely special\nobligations gives weight to morally insignificant contingent features\nof persons.\n\nThe distributive objection is troubling: it forces us to find some\njustification for that feature of common sense morality that C. D.\nBroad called \u2018self-referential altruism,\u2019 the view that\neach of us has special obligations to her family,\nher friends, her fellow citizens, etc. Defenders of\nspecial obligations need to show why our pre-theoretical commitment to\nsuch obligations is more than merely a reflection of our constitution\nas, in Hume\u2019s terms, \u2018limited altruists.\u2019 Advocates\nof evolutionary ethics will suggest that, given that we can offer a\nstory about why beliefs to the effect that we owe more to certain\npersons than to others have survival advantage, we have reason to\ndiscount the claim that we have genuine special obligations. It has\nbeen claimed that we are hard-wired to promote the continuance of our\ngenetic inheritance. Doing what we need to do to protect genetically\nrelated persons (and others willing to protect such persons), then, is\nevolutionarily advantageous. Thus, acting as though and believing that\nwe have special obligations (at least to friends and family members)\nis advantageous.\n\nOf course, there are difficulties with appeal to an evolutionary\naccount of the source of our beliefs about our obligations. All that\nsuch an appeal does is to propose a causal hypothesis about the\ngenesis of our beliefs. Even if that causal hypothesis is true, it\ndoes not show that the belief that we have special obligations is\nfalse. People often acquire true beliefs as a result of mechanisms\nthat do not provide any evidence or justification for the belief. For\nall that we know, our acceptance of modus ponens as an inferential\nrule might be due to the selective advantage accruing to those who use\nthat rule, but, I take it, few would see that as undermining the\nvalidity of that rule of inference.\n\nLeaving aside any such evolutionary considerations, however, still\nleaves us with the fact that the intuitive pull of special obligations\ncompetes with the intuitive pull of the consequentialist stance. In\norder to avoid the latter and to respond to charges of parochialism,\nthe defender of special obligations needs to deal with the\ndistributive objection.\n\nOne potential response is to insist that upon acquiring special\nobligations, a moral agent does not owe less to other persons, but,\nrather, simply owes more to her intimates. Thus, in addition to our\nduty of benevolence, we have, as Ross claimed, special obligations to\nthose who \u201cstand to me in the relation of promisee to promiser,\nof creditor to debtor, of wife to husband, of child to parent, of\nfriend to friend, of fellow countryman to fellow countryman, and the\nlike\u201d (19). The more such relationships that I stand in, the\nmore obligations I acquire. Unless my duty of benevolence is a\nmaximizing duty, there is no reason to suppose that I cannot balance\nthat duty with my special obligations. Of course, even if my\nobligations to \u2018outsiders\u2019 have not decreased, it is still\ntrue that \u2018insiders\u2019 will be benefitted more than\n\u2018outsiders,\u2019 and that might still be worrisome. However,\ngiven that \u2018insiders\u2019 also have to bear the cost of\nbenefitting other \u2018insiders,\u2019 the relative balance of\ncosts and benefits might remain the same for insiders and outsiders.\nBut, the defender of special obligations might say, as long as I\nbenefit everyone to the extent to which I owe them benefits, why is\nthe relative balance of costs and benefits relevant? Only on the most\nradical of egalitarian views is the equalizing of that balance\nconsidered an end in itself of morality.\n\nIn any case, this reply to the distributive objection depends upon the\nclaim that we can balance our special obligations against our natural\nor consequentialist duties. According to most defenders of special\nobligations, such obligations are prima facie obligations, i.e., they\nare obligations with a certain weight that can be counterbalanced by\nthe weight of other special obligations or of other types of\nobligations. In order to figure out what our all-things-considered\nduty is, we need to weigh all of our reasons for action and decide\nwhich is the strongest or weightiest in the circumstances. One\nadvantage of a theory such as consequentialism is that, given that it\nregards all of our obligations or duties as derivative from one\nfundamental duty (the duty to maximize value), we do not need to try\nto determine which of our duties is strongest in any given instance.\nOnce we allow non-derivative, genuinely special obligations in our\nmoral theory, we are left with the question as to whether we can ever\nknow when a special obligation outweighs another special obligation or\na natural duty. Moral philosophers such as Ross give us no answer to\nthis question, and it is plausible to suppose that there is no general\nrule that we can use for weighing duties against one another. Perhaps\nthe best answer is that, once we know what our obligations are, it is\nself-evident as to which is the strongest, always remembering that\n\u2018self-evident\u2019 does not mean \u2018obvious,\u2019 but,\nrather, \u2018can be known or justifiably believed without any\nprocess of reasoning or inference.\u2019 At this point, we are\ninvolved in controversies in moral epistemology that are beyond the\nscope of this piece.\n",
