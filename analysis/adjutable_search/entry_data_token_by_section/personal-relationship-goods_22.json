    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || The Holistic Egalitarian Challenge\n5.4 The Holistic Egalitarian Challenge\n\nEven if personal relationship goods can be accommodated by any metric\nof justice, there is another serious objection to seeing them as the\nproper object of (re)distribution. Many egalitarians think that what\nmatters for realizing justice is equality of overall advantage, and\nthat losses of advantage in one area of life can be compensated by\nhigher levels of advantage in another. In this sense, they are\nholistic. If this is correct, it means that it could be just for some\npeople to enjoy hardly any (opportunities for) personal relationship\ngoods\u2014beyond what they need for minimal functioning and\nautonomy\u2014as long as they enjoy other goods more abundantly.\nRejecting holism will make it difficult for a theory to avoid being\n(perhaps, mildly) perfectionistic; at the same time, it seems very\ncounterintuitive that the unchosen lack of certain kinds of\ngoods\u2014which likely include personal relationship\ngoods\u2014from an individual\u2019s life can be adequately\ncompensated for by any amount of other goods.\n",
