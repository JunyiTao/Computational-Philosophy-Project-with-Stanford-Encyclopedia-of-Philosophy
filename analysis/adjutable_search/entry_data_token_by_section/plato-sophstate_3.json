At the start of the search for the sophist, the\nEleatic visitor remarks that he and Theaetetus may share merely the\nname \u201csophist\u201d in common but may mean quite different\nthings by the name. He aims to establish agreement about the kind to\nwhich they ascribe the name (Sophist 218b\u2013c), and he\nwants to find a real definition\u2014a definition that applies to all\nand only members of the kind, and one that explains why any\ninstance is an instance of that kind: the inquirers seek the\nessence of the target kind, the property or collection of\nproperties that make the kind what it is.\n\n\nAs a preliminary step in locating the essence of a kind, the \ninquirers must figure out what people understand by the name of that \nkind. This opening maneuver can occur in several ways: First, what \ndoes the name connote, and what associations does it conjure up? The \nword \u201csophist\u201d is cognate with the word \nsophos, which means \u201cwise \n man.\u201d[1]\n That connection suggests that the sophist has some sort of wisdom \n(sophia) or expertise (techn\u00ea) \n(Sophist 221c\u2013d). This idea enables the inquirers to locate \nthe sophist\u2019s ability and practice at the outset in the wide kind art\nor expertise (techn\u00ea). The word \n\u201cstatesman\u201d in Greek (politikos) is cognate with\nthe word \u201ccity\u201d (polis), and so people associate\nthe statesman\u2019s activity with affairs of a city (Statesman \n305e). In addition, the Stranger relates statesman and king (Statesman 258e) \nand relies on the Homeric epithet of Agamemnon as shepherd of the \npeople (cf. Miller 2004, 40\u201343). The image of a herdsman quietly \nguides the initial attempt to define the statesman, whom the Stranger\nidentifies in the opening division as herdsman of the human flock.\n\n\nSecond, what sorts of individuals does the name pick out, and what\nfeatures do those individuals share? Readers of the Socratic dialogues\nwill recall that when Socrates asks his \u201cWhat is X?\u201d\nquestion (e.g., \u201cWhat is piety?\u201d \u201cWhat is\ncourage?\u201d \u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d), the respondent\nfrequently opens with some sort of list. Euthyphro, when asked what\npiety is, says: \u201cI say that piety is doing what I\u2019m doing right\nnow, prosecuting the wrongdoer, be it about murder or temple robbery\nor anything else, whether the wrongdoer is your father or your mother\nor anyone else\u201d (Euthyphro 5d\u2013e). Theaetetus,\nwhen asked what knowledge is, first replies: \u201cI think the things\nsomeone might learn from Theodorus are knowledge\u2014geometry and\nthe things you enumerated just now [arithmetic, astronomy,\nmusic]\u2014and cobbling, too, and the arts (technai) of the\nother craftsmen; all of them together and each separately are simply\nknowledge\u201d (Theaetetus 146c\u2013d). Socrates\nregularly objects that the interlocutor has merely given him a list,\nwhereas he wants to know what all the items on the list have in common\nand what makes them all instances of one kind. Although he complains\nabout the list, it helps to orient the investigation, because\nreflection on the list equips the inquirers to see the common features\nshared by all the items enumerated.\n\n\nThe Phaedrus calls this technique collection, and it\nis used together with division (Phaedrus 265d\u2013266b). A\ncollection can occur at the beginning of an investigation and at any\nstep of a division. By means of collection an inquirer brings together\na number of disparate things or kinds of things, often called by\ndifferent names, into one kind. The Statesman offers a good\nexample of a collection at the outset of its inquiry. The visitor\ngathers together several kinds of things, called by different names,\ninto one kind\u2014the target kind to be defined:\n\n\nShall we posit the statesman, the king, the slave-master,\nand further the household manager, as one thing, although we call them\nall these names, or should we say there are as many arts as the names\nused? (Statesman 258e)\n\n\n\n\nThe visitor remarks that although we call these people by different \nnames, they all have in common a power to maintain their rule by the \nstrength of their understanding with little use of their hands and \nbodies (Statesman 259c). This is a rough and ready description of the target \nkind the inquirers hope to find at the terminus of their \ndivision. This crude description enables them to pick out a wide kind\nto divide (knowledge, epist\u00eam\u00ea), and to take a \nnumber of steps in the division. The Stranger first divides knowledge\ninto practical and theoretical and then seeks to locate the target kind at\nthe terminus stemming from theoretical knowledge.\n",
