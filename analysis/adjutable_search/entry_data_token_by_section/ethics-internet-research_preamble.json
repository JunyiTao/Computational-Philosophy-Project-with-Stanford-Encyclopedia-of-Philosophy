    "main_text": "\n\nThere is little research that is not impacted in some way on or\nthrough the Internet. The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue,\nhas specific and far-reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics\nis a subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from\nsocial sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and natural\nsciences. Extant ethical frameworks, including\n consequentialism,\n deontology,\n virtue ethics,\n and\n feminist ethics,\n have contributed to the ways in which ethical issues in Internet\nresearch are considered and evaluated.\n\nConceptually and historically, Internet research ethics is most\nrelated to computer and information ethics and includes such ethical\nissues as participant knowledge and consent, data privacy, security,\nanonymity and confidentiality, and integrity of data, intellectual\nproperty issues, and community, disciplinary, and professional\nstandards or norms. Throughout the Internet\u2019s evolution, there\nhas been continued debate whether there are new ethical dilemmas\nemerging, or if the existing dilemmas are similar to dilemmas in other\nresearch realms (Elgesem 2002; Walther 2002; Ess & AoIR 2002;\nMarhkam & Buchanan 2012). These debates are similar to\nphilosophical debates in computer and information ethics. For example,\nmany years ago, James Moor (1985) asked \u201cwhat is special about\ncomputers\u201d in order to understand what, if anything, is unique\nethically. Reminding us, however, that research itself must be guided\nby ethical principles, regardless of technological intervention, van\nHeerden et al. (2020) and Sloan et al. (2020) stress that the\n\u201cfundamental principles of conducting ethical social research\nremain the same\u201d (Ess & AoIR 2002; King 1996; Samuel and\nBuchanan, 2020).\n\nYet, as the Internet has evolved into a more social and communicative\ntool and venue, the ethical issues have shifted from purely\ndata-driven to more human-centered. \u201cOn-ground\u201d or\nface-to-face analogies, however, may not be applicable to online\nresearch. For example, the concept of the public park has been used as\na site where researchers might observe others with little ethical\ncontroversy, but online, the concepts of public versus private are\nmuch more complex (SACHRP 2013). Thus, some scholars suggest that the\nspecificity of Internet research ethics calls for new regulatory\nand/or professional and disciplinary guidance. For these reasons, the\nconcept of human subjects research policies and regulation, informs\nthis entry, which will continue discussions around ethical and\nmethodological complexity, including personal identifiability,\nreputational risk and harm, notions of public space and public text,\nownership, and longevity of data as they relate to Internet research.\nSpecifically, the emergence of the social web raises issues around\nsubject or participant recruitment practices, tiered informed consent\nmodels, and protection of various expectations and forms of privacy in\nan ever-increasing world of diffused and ubiquitous technologies.\nAdditional ethical concerns center on issues of anonymity and\nconfidentiality of data in spaces where researchers and their subjects\nmay not fully understand the terms and conditions of those venues or\ntools, challenges to data integrity as research projects can be\noutsourced or crowdsourced to online labor marketplaces, and\njurisdictional issues as more research is processed, stored, and\ndisseminated via cloud computing or in remote server locales,\npresenting myriad legal complexities given jurisdictional differences\nin data laws. Further, the dominance of big data research has\ncontinued across research spaces, with the notions of\n\u201creal-world data\u201d and pervasive computing readily accepted\nand used in all disciplines. The ease of access and availability to\nuse big data sets in myriad ways has enabled AI (artificial\nintelligence) and ML (machine learning) to grow as standard tools for\nresearchers.\n\nAs a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a\nspace of research\u2014and their research ethics boards (REBs), also\nknown as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or\nhuman research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as\nAustralia\u2014have been confronted with a series of new ethical\nquestions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the\nprivacy of subjects engaging in activities in \u201cpublic\u201d\nInternet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous\nsurveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity\nassured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online?\nHow should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a\nsubject is not a minor? Is deception (pretending to be someone you are\nnot, withholding identifiable information, etc.) an acceptable online\nnorm or a harm? How is \u201charm\u201d possible to someone existing\nin an online space? How identifiable are individuals in large data\nsets? Do human subjects protections apply to big data? As more\nindustry-sponsored research takes place, what ethical protections\nexist outside of current regulatory structures? As laws, such as the\nEU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016) are enacted,\nwhat are the global implications for data privacy and individual\nrights?\n\nA growing number of scholars have explored these and related questions\n(see, for example, Bromseth 2002; Bruckman 2006; Buchanan 2004;\nBuchanan & Ess 2008; Johns, Chen & Hall 2003; Kitchin 2003,\n2008; King 1996; Mann 2003; Markham & Baym 2008; McKee &\nPorter 2009; Thorseth 2003; Ess 2016; Zimmer & Kinder-Kurlanda\n(eds.) 2017; Samuel & Buchanan, 2020), scholarly associations have\ndrafted ethical guidelines for Internet research (Ess &\nAssociation of Internet Researchers 2002; Markham, Buchanan, and AoIR\n2012; franzke et al., 2020; Kraut et al. 2004), and non-profit\nscholarly and scientific agencies such as AAAS (Frankel & Siang\n1999) are confronting the myriad of ethical concerns that Internet\nresearch poses to researchers and research ethics boards (REBs).\n\nGiven that over 50% of the world population uses the Internet, and\nthat 97% of the world population now lives within reach of a mobile\ncellular signal and 93% within reach of a 3G (or higher) network\n(International Telecommunications Union, 2019), continued exploration\nof the ethical issues related to research in this heavily mediated\nenvironment is critical.\n",
