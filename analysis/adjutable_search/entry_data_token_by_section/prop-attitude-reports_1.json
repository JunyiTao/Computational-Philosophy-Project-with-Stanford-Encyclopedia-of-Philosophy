    "main_text": "Problems for the simple Fregean solution\n3. Problems for the simple Fregean solution\n\nFrege\u2019s solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle has been criticized on\nseveral fronts. Some accuse it for violating semantic innocence.\n(Davidson 1968 is the locus classicus of this complaint;\nBarwise and Perry 1983 develop the charge.) Proponents of semantic\ninnocence see an expression as having the same reference in a wide\nbody of linguistic environments. In particular, \u2018Superman\u2019\nis seen as having the same reference in (1) as it does in (5).\n\nSometimes semantic innocence is just taken as a raw datum. But one\nmight also substantiate the claim by considering anaphora across\nattitude verbs. (For more, see the entry on\n anaphora.)\n Consider the following.\n\n(8) Jack and Jill went up the hill and Jack believes that she went up\nfirst.\n\n\nThere is a reading of (8) where \u2018she\u2019, as it occurs in\n(8), is anaphoric on \u2018Jill\u2019; that is, \u2018she\u2019 is\nanchored to \u2018Jill\u2019, in the sense that the reference of the\nformer is inherited from the reference of the later.\n\u2018Jill\u2019, as it occurs in (8), is outside the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb and hence has its customary reference. So,\nthen, it would seem, \u2018she\u2019 must also have the customary\nreference of \u2018Jill\u2019 and hence must refer to an individual\nand not a sense. This runs contrary to Frege\u2019s reference-shift\nclaim. More generally, Frege\u2019s theory seems to have trouble\naccounting for the truth of sentences like (8), as \u2018she\u2019\n(for example) seems to simply pick out Jill herself independently of\nany mode of presentation. (Sentence (8) tells us nothing about how\nJack represents Jill.) Soames 1989 presents a similar argument against\nthe Fregean solution, although he does not use it to argue for\nsemantic innocence directly. The point is related to the more general\nworry that Fregean accounts cannot offer an adequate account of de\nre belief. (See the supplementary document on \n\nThe De Re/De Dicto Distinction\n\n\nfor further discussion.)\n\nThe Fregean should not be terribly perturbed by these observations.\nFirst, even if we find semantic innocence a virtue, the key insights\nbehind Frege\u2019s solution can be applied without invoking\nreference-shifting. And it is reference-shifting, not the\nsense/reference distinction itself, that innocence forbids.\nFrege\u2019s key insights are that singular terms have both a sense\nand a reference, that co-referring singular terms can have different\nsenses, and that propositional attitude verbs are sensitive to the\n(customary) senses of the expressions embedded in their scope and not\nmerely their (customary) referents. Frege pulled off the last insight\nby claiming that propositional attitude verbs induce a\nreference-shift. But there are other ways to get the same result. One\nmight, for example, claim that \u2018believes\u2019 functions\nsomewhat like \u2018so-called\u2019 in (9) below.\n\n(9) Giorgione was so-called because of his size.\n\n\n(The example is from Quine 1953.) \u2018Giorgione\u2019, as it\noccurs in (9), simply refers to the man Giorgione. But substitution is\nillegitimate because \u2018so-called\u2019 refers to the expression\npreceding it and not merely the referent of that expression. So,\nsubstitution fails but not because the substitution affects the\nreference of the terms. Rather, substituting \u2018Giorgione\u2019\nwith the co-referring \u2018Barbarelli\u2019 in (9) affects the\nreference of \u2018so\u2019 in \u2018so-called\u2019. (This\ndiffers from Quine\u2019s own explanation of why substitution fails\nin (9).)\n\nSimilarly, a neo-Fregean might claim that expressions have their\ncustomary references and senses whether inside or outside the scope of\na propositional attitude verb, thus ensuring semantic innocence, but\ninsist that propositional attitude verbs themselves are in some way\nsensitive to the senses of the expressions within their scope and not\nmerely their references. Then substitution of co-referring singular\nterms within the scope of an attitude verb is blocked, as such\nsubstitution affects the semantic value of the attitude verb itself,\nbut innocence is preserved. (See Forbes 1989, 1990, 1993 for\ndevelopment of a similar idea. Pietroski 1996 argues for a Fregean\naccount that respects innocence as well, although his account, unlike\nForbes\u2019s, is developed in the Davidsonian framework.) So, a\nFregean can accept semantic innocence.\n\nFurthermore, it is far from clear that semantic innocence must be\naccepted. We cannot directly intuit that an occurrence of a proper\nname in the scope of an attitude verb has the same reference as an\noccurrence of that name outside the scope of that attitude verb. That\nis too theoretical a claim to be within the domain of intuition. It\nmust be supported by argument and we can question whether the\nphenomena of cross-attitudinal anaphora support semantic innocence. In\nhis 1969, Kaplan taught us how we can be Fregeans and allow\nquantifying into attitude verbs. (See the supplementary document on\nthe de re/de dicto distinction, op cit.,\nfor the details.) The key idea was to introduce a relation between an\nindividual-concept and the object it determines; Kaplan, following\nChurch 1951, called this D, which is a \u201cdenotation\npredicate.\u201d The same technique can be used to account for the\nanaphoric dependence of a pronoun inside the scope of an attitude verb\non a singular term outside the scope of that verb. A sentence like (8)\nwould then be read as something like: \u201cJack and Jill went up the\nhill and (there is an individual-concept c that\n\u201ddesignates\u201c Jill such that) Jack stands in the belief\nrelation to the proposition consisting of c and the semantic\nvalue of \u2018went up first\u2019.\u201d There may well be\nproblems with this account. But its mere presence shows two things.\nFirst, one needs an argument for the claim that a proper treatment of\ncross-attitudinal anaphoric relations is possible only if semantic\ninnocence is accepted. And that argument will have to show what is\nwrong with a view like the one suggested by Kaplan, as that view\npromises to show how a reference-shifting view can accommodate the\nphenomena. Second, and relatedly, one cannot refute the Fregean claim\nthat proper names have both a sense and a reference and that\npropositional attitude ascriptions are sensitive to sense and not just\nreference simply by producing sentences like (8).\n\nThe simple Fregean solution, however, faces other, more serious,\nproblems. First, the account seems to fail when we try to extend it to\nother types of attitude reporting sentences than the classical\nexamples we have considered above. One of our most common ways of\nreferring to individuals is to use indexicals and demonstratives, such\nas \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019, \u2018this\u2019,\n\u2018she\u2019, and \u2018they\u2019. It is difficult to\naccommodate the use of such terms with a Fregean theory that requires\nthat the mode of presentation is the semantic value of a singular term\nin a propositional attitude clause. (See Perry 1977, 1979 and Kaplan\n1977, pp. 529\u201336 for a development of the problem of indexicals\nand demonstratives. See Evans 1985 for an attempt to solve the\nproblems indexicals pose for a Fregean solution to Frege\u2019s\npuzzle. For more recent attempts, see Heck 2002.)\n\nFrege\u2019s solution, remember, involves two claims: that indicating\nthe sense is indicating the way the believer represents the individual\nand that belief attributions indicate the sense. These two claims seem\nto get the wrong results for propositional attitude reporting\nsentences with indexicals in their complement clauses. Consider, for\nexample, the following sentence.\n\n(10) Alice believes that I will solve an important problem in physics.\n\n\nSuppose that Bob Smith utters (10). Smith\u2019s use of\n\u2018I\u2019 tells us nothing about how Alice represents Smith; in\nparticular, it does not refer to or otherwise involve anything that we\nwould ordinarily call the sense of \u2018I\u2019. (It would\nbe strange indeed if what made the attribution true was Alice\u2019s\nstanding in the belief relation to a proposition containing the\nfirst-person mode of presentation associated with \u2018I\u2019 and\nthe semantic value of \u2018will solve an important problem in\nphysics\u2019. If there is such a first-person mode of presentation,\nthen this is what it is for Alice to believe that she\nherself will solve an important problem in physics, which is\nnot what Smith was saying in uttering (10).) Call this the problem\nof indexicals. (There is a large literature on this problem. A\nfirst wave of important work on the problem include Casta\u00f1eda\n1966,1967. 1999, Chisholm 1981, Evans 1982, especially chapters\n6\u20137, Frege 1956, Lewis 1981, Perry 1977, 1979, Stalnaker 1981.\nFor more recent important papers, see: Cappelen and Dever 2014,\nGarcia-Carpintero 2013, 2017, Magidor 2015, McKay 1986, Perry 1997,\n1998, 2001, Recanati 2007.) \n\nThe problem is that the perspective connected to a use of an indexical\nin an attitude report is not typically intended to match the\nperspective of the target of the report. For example, Jane might tell\nyou that Lois believes that he is strong, pointing at Clark Kent,\nwithout expecting the perspective associated with her use of\n\u2018he\u2019 to match in any straightforward way Lois\u2019s\nperspective. Indeed, it is quite intuitive that one might truly report\nanother\u2019s beliefs using a demonstrative to refer to something\nthat agent is not in a position to refer to demonstratively in any way\nwhatsoever.\n\nA related problem involves attributions of a common belief to many\npeople. Like the problem of indexicals, this problem raises questions\nfor the Fregean claim that a belief attribution indicates the way in\nwhich the believer represents an individual in belief. It seems\nplausible that different people associate different modes of\npresentation with the same name. If so, the following sort of sentence\nseems to prove difficult for the Fregean.\n\n(11) Many people believe that Bob Smith will solve an important\nproblem in physics.\n\n\nSomeone attributing such a belief cannot be responsible for the many\nmodes of representation that the various believers associate with\n\u2018Bob Smith\u2019. It may seem that the theory could work in\nthis case only if we could find a sense for \u2018Bob Smith\u2019\nthat does not vary from person to person and that can serve as the\nmode of presentation of that individual for each person. That seem\nunlikely. Let\u2019s call this the problem of variability in\nsense. (See Richard 1988 for a development of the variability\nproblem. See Forbes 1989, 1990 for an attempt to solve it.)\n\nFregeans should accept that the truth of (10) does not require that\nAlice think of the speaker under a first-person mode of presentation\nassociated with \u2018I\u2019 and that the truth of (11) does not\nrequire that everyone think of Smith in the same way. But, as a\nFregean, they will insist that the truth of these reports require more\nthan merely having beliefs with the relevant referential content. One\nway to pull this off is to attempt to construct a similarity class of\nmodes of presentations. We say that the truth of (10) only requires\nthat Alice think of the speaker in a suitably related way to\nthe first-person mode of presentation the attributer associates with\n\u2018I\u2019 and (11) requires only that everyone think of Smith in\nsome suitably related way to sense the attributer associates\nwith \u2018Bob Smith\u2019. The work will all be done in specifying\nwhat it is for an arbitrary mode of presentation to be suitably\nrelated to the attributer\u2019s mode of presentation. Presumably a\nFregean would want the similarity class to be defined more narrowly\nthan just in terms of co-reference. (Dummett 1973, p. 384 suggested\nthat Frege subscribed to a view where reference-preservation sufficed\nfor reports with indexicals. There is little plausibility to such a\nhistorical claim, particularly in light of Frege\u2019s comments on\nindexicals in his 1918.) Finding such a middle ground between identity\nof sense and mere co-reference may well prove to be difficult indeed.\nHowever, much of what Mark Richard says in his 1990 (discussed below\nin\n Section 6)\n about restrictions on correlation functions can be employed by the\nFregean to try to find this middle ground. So, the problems of\nindexicals and variability do not seem fatal to a broadly Fregean\naccount of propositional attitude reporting sentences.\n\nRelated to the above problems facing a Fregean view is the problem of\nintuitive entailment-successes. Suppose that Bill utters the sentence\n\u2018I am happy\u2019 and Lois believes him. Then, intuitively,\nthere is something such that Bill said it and Lois believes it. But it\nis hard to see how the Fregean can account for such apparent\nentailment-successes, precisely because of the way in which the\naccount explains intuitive entailment-failures like (1) and (4).\n\nThere are many important neo-Fregean account that have been developed\nand promise to avoid these problems, including: Church 1951, Cumming\n2008, Evans 1982, Forbes 1990, Garcia-Carpintero 2017, Heck 2002,\n2012, 2014, Zalta 2001.)\n\nMany have taken the problems presented above to show that the only\nsemantically relevant value of a singular term in the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb is its reference and so reject Fregean\nsolution to Frege\u2019s puzzle. But if we insist that the sole\nsemantically relevant value of a singular term is its reference, what\nis there to say about the intuitive difference between (1) and (4) and\nthe arguments that they differ in truth-value?\n",
