    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nIn the later Middle Ages Albert of Saxony (Albertus de\nSaxonia) was sometimes called Albertucius (Little\nAlbert), to distinguish him from the thirteenth-century theologian\nAlbert the Great. He is however a master of great importance in his\nown right. He was born at Rickensdorf, in the region of Helmstedt\n(Lower Saxony) in present-day Germany, in the beginning of the 1320s.\nAfter initial schooling in his native area, and possibly a sojourn at\nErfurt, he made his way to Prague and then on to Paris. He was member\nof the English-German Nation and became a master of arts in 1351. He\nwas Rector of the University of Paris in 1353. He remained in Paris\nuntil 1362, during which time he taught arts and studied theology at\nthe Sorbonne, apparently without obtaining a degree in the latter\ndiscipline. His logical and philosophical works were composed during\nthis period. After two years of carrying out diplomatic missions\nbetween the Pope and the Duke of Austria, he was charged with founding\nthe University of Vienna, of which he became the first Rector in 1365.\nAppointed canon of Hildesheim in 1366, he was also named Bishop of\nHalberstadt the same year, serving in that office until his death on\nJuly 8, 1390.\n\nNot having left any theological writings or a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (at least none that we know\nof), Albert is primarily known for his works on logic and natural\nphilosophy. Albert\u2019s masterwork in logic is the Logica\n(later designed as Perutilis logica, Very Useful Logic).\nAlbert also composed a voluminous collection of Sophismata,\nwhich examines numerous sentences that raise difficulties of\ninterpretation due to the presence of syncategorematic words \u2014\ni.e., terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which,\naccording to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate\nsignification but rather modify the signification of the other terms\nin the propositions in which they occur. He also wrote several\nquestion commentaries: Quaestiones on the Ars Vetus\nor Old Logic (i.e., the Isagoge of Porphyry and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories and De\nInterpretatione), Quaestiones on the Posterior\nAnalytics, and a series of 25 Quaestiones logicales\n(Logical Questions), addressed to semantic problems and the status of\nlogic. Albert of Saxony also commented the main texts of the\nAristotelian natural philosophy (Physica, De caelo, De generatione\net corruptione, De sensu et sensato, Meteorologica) together with\nthe De sphaera of John of Sacrobosco. By contrast, the\nQuaestiones de anima that were attributed to him are of\ndubious authenticity. He also wrote commentaries on Ethics\nand Economics, and texts of mathematics: a treatise De\nproportionibus, a Quaestio de quadratura circuli, a\nTractatus de maximo et minimo.\n\nThe most renowned philosopher when Albert studied and taught in the\nFaculty of Arts at Paris was John Buridan. Albert was one of several\nmasters contemporary with or immediately following Buridan whose work\ntransformed logic and natural philosophy in the later Middle Ages. For\na long time he was thought to have been a pupil or follower of\nBuridan, but this idea is now widely questioned. Some of his works on\nlogic and physics were composed before Buridan had lectured on these\nsubjects for the last time, and Buridan clearly takes notice of them,\nwhether for criticizing or for adopting Albert\u2019s views. In\nlogic, he seems to have been influenced by certain ideas and methods\nimported from England. His logic depends very much on Ockham\u2019s,\nbut the influence of William Heytesbury is also evident in his\nSophismata. Walter Burley was another important influence on\nAlbert, though this is somewhat puzzling in view of the fact that they\nhad opposing views on the nature of universals. In any case, Burley\nseems to have been on Albert\u2019s mind when he wrote his commentary\non the Nicomachean Ethics as well as when he was developing\nhis theory of consequences.\n\nThese different influences have sometimes made Albert seem no more\nthan an eclectic compiler of the views of others. But, in addition to\nproviding the context for some of his own contributions,\nAlbert\u2019s fluency with the views of his contemporaries gives him\na unique place in the development of logic and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Paris in the fourteenth century.\n",
