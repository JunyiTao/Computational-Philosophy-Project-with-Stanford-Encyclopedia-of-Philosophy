    "main_text": "What is mental imagery? || Mental imagery in the empirical sciences\n1.1 Mental imagery in the empirical sciences\n\nThe concept of mental imagery was first consistently used in the then\nvery new discipline of empirical psychology at the end of the\n19th century. At that time, psychologists like Francis\nGalton, Wilhelm Wundt or Edward Titchener (Galton 1880, Wundt 1912,\nTitchener 1909) thought of mental imagery as a mental phenomenon\ncharacterized by its phenomenology \u2013 a quasi-perceptual episode\nwith a certain specific phenomenal feel. This stance lead to serious\nsuspicion, and often the outright rejection, of this concept in the\nfollowing decades when behaviorism dominated the psychological\ndiscourse (Kulpe 1895, Ryle 1949, Dennett 1969). It was not until the\n1970s that mental imagery was again considered to be a respectable\nconcept to study in the empirical sciences of the mind.\n\nJust as perception can be characterized in a variety of ways, the same\ngoes for mental imagery. One way of characterizing perception is in\nterms of its phenomenology: perception would be a mental process that\nis characterized by a certain specific phenomenology. The problem is\nthat phenomenology is not publicly observable and, as a result, it is\nnot a good starting point for scientific study. The same\nconsiderations apply for mental imagery. But we can also characterize\nperception functionally or neuroanatomically and these ways of\nthinking about perception would be publicly observable and, as a\nresult, would be a good starting point for the scientific study of\nperception. And this is exactly how perceptual psychology and the\nneuroscience of perception proceeds. Again, the same considerations\napply for mental imagery.\n\nAs a result, in recent decades psychologists and neuroscientists,\nrather than relying on introspection and phenomenology, characterized\nmental imagery in functional and neuroscientific terms. Here is a\ntypical characterization from a review article that summarizes the\nstate of the art concerning mental imagery in psychology, psychiatry\nand neuroscience, published in the flagship journal Trends in\nCognitive Sciences: \u201cWe use the term \u2018mental\nimagery\u2019 to refer to representations [\u2026] of sensory\ninformation without a direct external stimulus\u201d (Pearson et al.\n2015, p. 590, see also Dijkstra et al. 2019). In short, according to\nthe psychological definition, mental imagery is perceptual\nrepresentation not triggered directly by sensory input (or\nrepresentation-involving perceptual processing not triggered directly\nby sensory input \u2013 these two phrases will be used interchangeably in\nwhat follows).\n\nThe concept of directness may need some further clarification (and the\nsame goes for the concept of \u201cappropriate immediate sensory\ninput\u201d (Kosslyn et al., 1995, p. 1335, see also Shepard and\nMetzler 1971) that has also been used to specify what mental imagery\nlacks). The perceptual processing (in the early cortices) is triggered\ndirectly by sensory input if it is triggered without the\nmediation of some other (perceptual or extra-perceptual) processes. If\nthe perceptual processing is triggered by something non-perceptual (as\nin the case of closing our eyes and visualizing), it is not triggered\neither directly or indirectly (see Section 1.3). If the perceptual\nprocessing in the visual sense modality is triggered by sensory input\nin the auditory sense modality (as in the case of an involuntary\nvisual imagery of your face when I hear your voice with my eyes\nclosed), the visual processing is triggered indirectly \u2013 with\nthe mediation of auditory processing (see Section 2.2). A direct\ntrigger here would be visual input, but there is no visual input in\nthis case. And if the visual processing at the center of the visual\nfield is triggered by input in the periphery of the visual field (say,\nbecause the center of the visual field is occluded by an empty white\npiece of paper), then the visual processing at the center of the\nvisual field is, again, triggered indirectly, that is, in a way\nmediated by the visual processes in the periphery (see Section 2.1). A\ndirect trigger would be sensory input at the center of the visual\nfield, but there is no such sensory input in this case. According to\nthe psychological definition of mental imagery, all three of these\ndifferent examples of perceptual processing count as mental imagery as\nthe perceptual processing is not triggered directly by the sensory\ninput.\n\nContemporary philosophical thinking about mental imagery comes close\nto this way of defining mental imagery (see Nanay forthcoming for a\nsummary). Gregory Currie, for example says that \u201cepisodes of\nmental imagery are occasions on which the visual system is driven\noff-line, disconnected from its normal sensory inputs\u201d (Currie\n1995, p. 26, see also Kind 2001, Richardson 1969, Currie and\nRavenscroft 2002, but see also Section 1.2 below and see Fazekas et\nal. 2021, for more on the concept of offline perception).\n\nThis way of thinking about mental imagery allows us to examine mental\nimagery empirically and in a publicly observable manner. To put it\nvery simply, if someone\u2019s eyes are closed, so she receives no\nvisual input and her early sensory cortices are nonetheless\nrepresenting an equilateral triangle at the middle of the visual field\n(something that can be established fairly easily given the retinotopy\nof vision by means of fMRI), this is an instance of mental\nimagery.\n\nThis psychological conception of mental imagery is neutral about some\nseemingly important features of mental imagery. If mental imagery is\nperceptual representation not triggered directly by sensory input,\nthen mental imagery may or may not be voluntarily triggered (see more\non this distinction in Section 1.3 below). Further, it may or may not\nbe conscious \u2013 even if you experience nothing, as long as there\nis a triangle in your primary visual cortex, but no triangle on your\nretina, you have mental imagery (see more on unconscious mental\nimagery in Section 1.2 below).\n\nThe psychological definition characterizes mental imagery is defined\nnegatively: it is perceptual representation not triggered\ndirectly by sensory input. This leaves open the question what it is\ntriggered by. Often it is triggered by higher level cognitive\nprocesses \u2013 this is the case when you count to three and\nvisualize an apple. But it can also be triggered laterally by\ndifferent sense modalities (see Section 2.2 below). And it can also be\ntriggered by sensory input but in an indirect manner (see Section 2.1\nbelow).\n",
