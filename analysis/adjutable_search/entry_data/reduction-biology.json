    "preamble": "\n\nReductionism encompasses a set of ontological, epistemological, and\nmethodological claims about the relations between different scientific\ndomains. The basic question of reduction is whether the properties,\nconcepts, explanations, or methods from one scientific domain\n(typically at higher levels of organization) can be deduced from or\nexplained by the properties, concepts, explanations, or methods from\nanother domain of science (typically at lower levels of organization).\nReduction is germane to a variety of issues in philosophy of science,\nincluding the structure of scientific theories, the relations between\nscientific disciplines, the nature of explanation, the diversity of\nmethodology, and notions of theoretical progress, as well as to\nnumerous topics in metaphysics and philosophy of mind, such as\nemergence, mereology, and supervenience.\n\nQuestions about reduction in biology are pervasive throughout the\nhistory of philosophy and science. Many contemporary debates have\nhistorical analogues that reflect long-standing controversies about\nthe legitimacy of reductionist research strategies and modes of\nexplanation used by different life science subdisciplines. In\nphilosophy of biology, debates about reduction in the second half of\nthe 20th century focused traditionally on the question of whether and\nin what sense classical genetics can be reduced to molecular biology\n(although other strands of discussion were present, such as whether\nevolutionary theory is inherently anti-reductionist because of the\nprinciple of natural selection).

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nReduction (reductionism) encompasses several, related philosophical\nthemes. At least three types can be distinguished: ontological,\nmethodological, and epistemic (Sarkar 1992, cf. Nagel 1998). Even\nthough arguments for and against reductionism often include a\ncombination of positions related to all three, these distinctions are\nsignificant because no straightforward entailment relations obtain\nbetween the different types of reduction (although tacit commitments\nabout these relations are prevalent).\n\n(i) Ontological reduction is the idea that each\nparticular biological system (e.g., an organism) is constituted by\nnothing but molecules and their interactions. In metaphysics this idea\nis often called\n physicalism\n (or materialism) and it assumes in a biological context that (a)\nbiological properties\n supervene\n on physical properties (i.e., no difference in a biological property\nwithout a difference in some underlying physical property), and (b)\neach particular biological process (or token) is\nmetaphysically identical to some particular physico-chemical process.\nThis latter tenet is sometimes called token-token reduction, in\ncontrast to the stronger tenet that each type of biological process is\nidentical to a type of physico-chemical process. Ontological reduction\nin this weaker sense is a default stance nowadays among philosophers\nand biologists though the philosophical details remain controversial\n(e.g., are there genuinely\n emergent properties?)\n Different conceptions of physicalism may yield different implications\nfor ontological reduction in biology (Dowell 2006). The denial of\nphysicalism by vitalism, the view that biological systems are governed\nby forces that are not physico-chemical, is largely of historical\ninterest. (Vitalism also admits of various conceptions, especially\nwith respect to how non-physico-chemical forces are understood; see\n Section 2.)\n Some authors have argued vigorously for the significance of\nmetaphysical concepts in discussions of reductionism in biology\n(Rosenberg 1978, 1985, 1994, 2006).\n\n(ii) Methodological reduction is the idea that\nbiological systems are most fruitfully investigated at the lowest\npossible level, and that experimental studies should be aimed at\nuncovering molecular and biochemical causes (Andersen 2017). A common\nexample of this type of strategy is the decomposition of a complex\nsystem into parts (Bechtel and Richardson 1993); a biologist might\ninvestigate the cellular parts of an organism in order to comprehend\nits behavior, or investigate the biochemical components of a cell to\nunderstand its features. Although methodological reductionism is often\nmotivated by a presumption of ontological reduction, this procedural\nrecommendation does not follow directly from it. In fact, unlike\ntoken-token reduction, methodological reductionism can be quite\ncontroversial. It has been argued that exclusively reductionist\nresearch strategies exhibit systematic biases that overlook relevant\nbiological features, and that for certain questions a more fruitful\nmethodology consists in integrating the discovery of molecular causes\nwith the investigation of higher level features (Wimsatt 1980,\n 2007).[1]\n\n(iii) Epistemic reduction is the idea that the\nknowledge about one scientific domain (typically about higher level\nprocesses) can be reduced to another body of scientific knowledge\n(typically concerning a lower or more fundamental level). While an\nendorsement of some form of epistemic reduction can be motivated by\nontological reduction in combination with methodological reductionism\n(e.g., the past success of reductionist research in biology), the\npossibility of epistemic reduction does not follow directly from their\nconjunction. Indeed, debates about reduction in the\n philosophy of biology\n have centered on this third type of reduction as the most\ncontroversial issue (see\n Section 4),\n and therefore our discussion will focus primarily on issues related\nto epistemic reduction. Prior to evaluating any reduction of one body\nof knowledge to another, a conception of those bodies of knowledge and\nwhat it would mean for them to be\n \u201creduced\u201d must be explicated.\n A number of different models of reduction have been proposed. Thus,\nthe debate about reduction in biology has not only revolved around\nwhether epistemic reduction is possible, but also which notions of\nepistemic reduction are operative in actual scientific reasoning. Two\nbasic categories can be distinguished: (a) models of theory\nreduction maintain that one theory can be logically deduced from\nanother theory\n (Section 3.1);\n and, (b) models of explanatory reduction focus on whether\nhigher level features can be explained by lower level features\n (Section 3.2).\n\nThe philosophical study of reduction links up with several key issues\nin the philosophy of science. As reduction involves relating (broadly\nspeaking) one \u201cbody of scientific knowledge\u201d to another,\nit presupposes an account of the relevant epistemic units to be\nrelated (e.g.,\n theories,\n laws,\n models,\n mechanisms,\n concepts,\n or disciplines)\u2014how should these be understood? Since the\nreduction of one theory to another usually presumes that somehow the\nreducing theory explains the principles of the reduced\ntheory, reduction is also related to the issue of\n scientific explanation.\n For example, if a more fundamental theory fully reduces another\ntheory or even reduces several theories,\n unification\n (of some sort) results. The situation where a historically earlier\ntheory is reduced to a later theory is an intuitive case in which\n scientific progress\n might occur. Arguments against the existence of this type of\nhistorical reduction have maintained that terms occurring in both the\nprecursor and descendant theory have different meanings\n (\u201cincommensurability\u201d).\n This indicates that questions about reduction also connect to the\nmeaning of scientific terms and conceptual change. Therefore, accounts\nof reduction often involve commitments made about other notions and\ntheir adequacy depends in many cases on these related philosophical\ncommitments. This has led some philosophers to pursue an account of\nreduction in biology that is as uncommitted as possible regarding the\nprecise construal of general notions such as \u201claw\u201d and\n\u201cexplanation\u201d (Sarkar 1998, cf. Brigandt 2013a), or to\nspecifically highlight how a particular package of general notions\ntravels together and skews our perspective on the shape of epistemic\nreduction in scientific practice (Godfrey-Smith 2008).\n\nIn philosophy of biology, reduction involves questions about how\ndifferent biological disciplines and theories are related, and how\nbiology is connected to physics and chemistry (e.g., is biology\nautonomous, possessing its own theoretical principles, explanations,\nand methods?). Over the past four decades, discussion has concentrated\nprimarily on the question of whether classical genetics can\nbe reduced to\n molecular genetics\n and biochemistry. This discussion was motivated by the increasing\nsignificance of\n molecular biology\n within the life sciences (Morange 2020), and revolved around specific\naccounts of reduction in science, such as Nagel\u2019s (1961) model.\nA less central concern has been whether evolutionary biology and\necology are autonomous disciplines or reducible to molecular\nbiology (Beatty 1990, Brandon 1996, Dupr\u00e9 1993, Rosenberg\n2006). For example, a notable issue in evolutionary contexts is the\nrelationship between functional explanation\n (\u201cteleology\u201d)\n and causal-mechanistic explanation (Wouters 2005). The\n levels of selection\n debate includes questions about whether all evolutionary explanations\ncan be cast in terms of genes and whether selection operates primarily\nor exclusively on the genetic level (\u00c5gren 2021, Okasha 2006).\nThe main debate about reduction in genetics has lost some intensity as\nmany philosophers developed a skeptical consensus regarding the\npossibility of substantive theory reduction (but see Waters 1990).\nThis decline has been accompanied by increasing attention to models of\nexplanatory reduction (e.g., Kaiser 2015, Sarkar 1998, Weber 2005)\nacross a wider variety of domains in biology (e.g., development,\necology, evolution, cell biology, and neuroscience). For example, the\nquestion of whether developmental biology can be reduced to\ndevelopmental genetics and molecular biology has become salient due to\nrecent progress in developmental genetics and growing philosophical\ninterest in\n developmental biology\n (Love 2008b, Robert 2004, Rosenberg 1997, 2006, Weber 2022). Less\nattention has been given to the question of whether biology can be\nreduced to physics (but see Rosenberg 2006). This has been an issue of\nconcern to many biologists (e.g., Mayr 2004), both with respect to\nmethodology (e.g., the adequacy of analyzing a system by dissecting it\ninto component parts) and whether modes of explanation from physical\nscience are inherently inappropriate for biological science (Love and\nH\u00fcttemann 2011).\n\nDebates about reduction in biology have often been framed in terms of\n\u201creductionism\u201d vs. \u201canti-reductionism\u201d (or,\nmore archaically, \u201cmechanism\u201d versus\n\u201corganicism\u201d or \u201cvitalism\u201d). However, since\ndifferent models of reduction have been put forward, whether one takes\na reductionist or anti-reductionist stance about a particular\nbiological subdiscipline (e.g., classical genetics) depends on the\nnotion of \u201creduction\u201d being utilized (Wimsatt 1976b, Hull\n1979). Furthermore, this framing has tended to create a false\ndichotomy between two extreme positions: reductionism as the idea that\nmolecular biology can in principle fully explain all\nbiological facts\u2014making higher level biological theories\ndispensable\u2014and anti-reductionism as the idea that higher level\nbiological fields possess explanatory principles of their own and are\nfully autonomous in the sense of not benefiting from\nmolecular biology. A variety of middle (and orthogonal) ground exists\nbetween these extremes and has motivated the efforts seen in\nalternative research programs in philosophy of science that address\nquestions about the nature and status of interdisciplinarity, such as\nhow data, standards, or explanations are integrated across biological\nfields (see\n Section 5).\n Given that references to \u201creduction\u201d in different areas\nof biology pick out a variety of commitments in different contexts,\nwhich makes pronouncements of both the success and failure of\n\u201creduction\u201d legitimate, the traditional assumption that\nthere is a unique and global notion in need of explication is\nproblematic (H\u00fcttemann and Love\n 2011).[2]\n2. Historical Background: Philosophical and Scientific\n\nUndoubtedly, the growth and development of molecular biology over the\npast half century has made reductionism in biology a central issue\n(and DNA a household word). However, it would be wrong to assume that\ndifferent aspects of reductionism only gain traction in the wake of\nthe molecularization of biology juxtaposed with discussions of\nreduction from a logical empiricist perspective (see\n Section 3.1).\n Besides a perennial concern with what makes\n life\n distinctive (Riskin 2018), we can distinguish at least two\nreductionist themes throughout history relevant to the life sciences\nand its philosophy: (1) the relation among different branches or\ndomains of knowledge and (2) the relation between\n parts and wholes\n (Grene and Depew 2004, Magner 1994). These two themes link up in a\ncomplex fashion with both epistemic and ontological reduction.\n(Questions about methodological reduction tend to coalesce around new\ntechnologies that open up the possibility of pursuing reductionist\nresearch methods, such as making observations at a lower level with\nmicroscopy.) Additionally, these themes arise in the context of\nspecific domains of enduring interest: (a) the complex relations among\ndifferent animals and plants in natural environments, i.e.,\n\u201cecology\u201d, (b) the integrated relations among the parts\nand whole of an organism, i.e., \u201cphysiology/functional\nanatomy\u201d, and (c) the dynamic relations among the homogeneous\ncomponents in the early stages of an embryo that eventually beget a\nunified whole organism containing heterogeneous parts in appropriate\narrangement and connection, i.e.,\n\u201cdevelopment/reproduction\u201d.\n\nAristotle\n is the foundation for both philosophical themes pertaining to\nreductionism. He addressed the relationship between domains of\nscientific knowledge in his concepts of superordinate and subordinate\nsciences (Posterior Analytics I). Each science has a\ndistinctive subject genus, first principles, and a set of predicates\nthat are commensurable with the subject genus (McKirahan 1978, 1992,\nch. 4\u20135). Though the relations among sciences are systematic,\nthey are not necessarily reductive because there is no most\nfundamental science. These connections are relevant to relations\nbetween parts and wholes because Aristotle utilized his science of\nelements and their potentials (e.g., as seen in On Generation and\nCorruption and Meteorology) to inform his description\nand analysis of organism components in the History of Animals\nand Parts of Animals. He treated three compositional\n\u201clevels\u201d: elements and their potentials; uniform parts\nsuch as blood and bone; and, non-uniform parts that include multiple\nuniform parts, such as the face or hands. The primary domain here is\nphysiology/functional anatomy but development/reproduction is always\nin view and addressed directly in the Generation of Animals.\nClaims about \u201cpotentials\u201d are buttressed by an account of\ntheir contributions to material properties composing uniform parts\n(Meteorology IV; see Lennox 2001, ch. 8, Popa 2005). Complex\ndispositions (e.g., the fleshy, sinuous elasticity of the esophagus)\nare postulated from these material substrates that have relevance to,\nbut do not determine the nature of, these organismal parts because\nfunctional strictures ultimately govern them (the fleshy, sinuous\nelasticity of the esophagus is for the sake of repeated\ndilation during food ingestion).\n\nThe\n teleological\n orientation of Aristotle\u2019s biology means that he is often\ncharacterized as an ontological anti-reductionist (e.g., the elemental\npotentials of lower levels of organization are for the sake of but do\nnot determine the uniform parts at higher levels of organization).\nThis blends with epistemic issues related to particular domains, such\nas his rejection of Presocratic materialist (i.e., purely\n\u201cmechanistic\u201d) explanations for the origin of animal\nmorphology during development. (Empedocles apparently claimed that\nvertebrae arise during ontogeny solely as a consequence of a unified\ncylindrical column physically breaking into the observable iterated\nunits of the backbone; see Parts of Animals I.1\n[640a].) Yet Aristotle was attentive to issues of material\ncomposition and constraints arising from the nature of properties\nexhibited by animal parts, which often mark commitments to types of\nontological and epistemic reduction. His concept of hypothetical\nnecessity (Physics II; see Cooper 1987) permitted the use of\none kind of material in many different organismal parts.\n Galen,\n among many others subsequent to Aristotle, also explored these\nissues, whether from the perspective of how material complexes\ngenerate higher level properties (Mixtures) or the relations\namong parts and wholes in the context of development (The\nConstruction of the Embryo).\n\nIn the early modern period, William Harvey adopted an Aristotelian\nstance in the context of both physiology and development (Lennox 2006,\n2017). The relation between parts and wholes in ontogeny, including\nrelevant material properties, is constantly in view (Harvey 1981\n[1651]). Although Harvey used \u201cmechanistic\u201d analogies,\nreferring to the motion of the heart in terms of interlocking gears or\nto the heart itself as a pump (Distelzweig 2016),\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n famously disputed Harvey\u2019s claims from the perspective of the\n \u201cmechanical philosophy\u201d.\n Descartes sought to explain the movement of the heart not in terms of\nfunction but rather by appeal only to the matter in motion composing\nthe circulating blood that is heated and thus expands akin to\nfermentation (Description of the Human Body). He also\nattempted to explain embryology in terms of matter and motion alone;\ne.g., tissue and organ origination is accounted for via matter slowing\ndown and aggregating in different regions of the embryo (Des Chene\n2001, ch. 2, Smith 2006, Part II).\n Robert Boyle\n defended teleological explanations in anatomy and physiology\n(specifically, the integrated relations among the parts and whole of\nan organism) by laying out how they were compatible with and supported\nby mechanistic explanations (Lennox 1983). Thus, he offered a version\nof epistemic reduction in line with his conception of mechanical\nphilosophy, which included a heterogeneous methodology (reductionist\nand non-reductionist) and concomitant reservations about ontological\nreduction.\n Baruch Spinoza\n famously used the image of a worm in a bloodstream to engage the\ntheme of part-whole relations and their complexity in a 1665 letter to\nHenry\n Oldenburg.[3]\n More broadly, the emergence of distinctive scientific approaches to\nliving phenomena in the 18th century involved constant debate over\nwhether organisms were composed of \u201cactive\u201d matter or\nenergized by an animating element, distinct from non-living entities,\nsuch that their resistance to decay could be accounted for by a\n\u201cvital materialism\u201d (Zammito 2018).\n\nImmanuel Kant\n explicitly articulated a dialectic between a teleological outlook on\norganismal functioning (including ecological relationships,\nphysiology, and development specifically) and a mechanistic\nunderstanding of causation modeled on Newtonian mechanics\n(Critique of Judgment, Part II; see Mensch 2013, Zuckert\n2010). Kant\u2019s maintenance of this tension between the reciprocal\ncausal relations of parts in an organism (\u201cteleology\u201d) and\nthe linear-mechanical causality justified within his critical\nphilosophy was a way of splitting apart epistemological and\nmetaphysical issues. It has elements of epistemic anti-reductionism\n(organismal processes must be understood in terms of their reciprocal\ncontribution to a systemic goal\u2014an epistemological subordination\nof mechanism to teleology) and ontological reductionism (all causation\nis ultimately linear-mechanical). But Kant also understood\nlinear-mechanical causation as a category by which the mind frames\nexperiences of the world. Thus, his understanding of metaphysics\ndiffers from the realist one underlying most contemporary accounts of\nontological reduction. In addition to the theme of reductive relations\nbetween parts and wholes, Kant also addressed relations among\ndifferent scientific domains in his discussion of sciences having\ntheir own distinct concepts and subject matter (Critique of\nJudgment, \u00a768, 79).\n\nKant\u2019s work was influential among those studying biological\nphenomena, even if misinterpreted in various ways, and helped frame\nthe question of teleology versus mechanism in the early 19th century\n(Lenoir 1982, Zammito 2012). His discussion stressed the significance\nof methodological conclusions\u2014it is necessary (a maxim or\nregulative principle) to take organisms as natural purposes if we are\nto investigate them scientifically. This encouraged speculations about\nnew forces, akin to those found in Newtonian mechanics, which would\nexplain biological phenomena \u201cmechanistically\u201d (e.g., the\nformative force explaining embryonic development; see Look 2006,\nRichards 2000). The Newtonian inspiration survived, with or without\nKantian traces, well into the 19th century and beyond. Comparative\nanatomy (conceptualized broadly to include functional anatomy and\nembryology) exploited methodological suggestions from successful\nphysical science. For example, Geoffroy St. Hilaire appealed to\nNewton\u2019s musings that animals are governed by similar principles\nor laws as those found in mechanics (Le Guyader 2004). More typical is\nRichard Owen\u2019s discussion of matter and its properties within\nliving organisms, where he exhibits a clear anti-reductionist stance\nand postulates something akin to emergent\n properties.[4]\n This perspective was shared by many comparative anatomists who used\nan \u201canalysis:synthesis\u201d style of reasoning (Elwick 2007).\nA related strand regarding reductionism winds its way through\nphysiological investigations of the 19th century. Here the Cartesian\nmechanical-reductionist program is rejoined with an emphasis on the\nanimal machine (Canguilhem in Delaporte 1994, ch. 5, 8, 10, 12,\nColeman 1977, ch. 6). Despite clear metaphysical commitments to a form\nof ontological reduction, methodological types of reductionism were\nqualified because of their impact on experimental design (e.g.,\nBernard 1957 [1865]). Overall, there was a diversity of mechanist\n(\u201creductionist\u201d) and organicist\n(\u201cnon-reductionist\u201d) positions corresponding to\nontological, epistemic, and methodological types of reduction in the\n19th century, similar to the philosophical diversity observable today\n(see Sections\n 3\n and\n 5\n below).\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the topic of development\nreturned with a vengeance in the controversy over vitalism (sometimes\ntermed \u201corganicism\u201d) (Normandin and Wolfe 2013). A general\nmovement towards more mechanistic or materialistic interpretations of\nliving systems was emerging at this time (e.g., Loeb 1912, cf. Allen\n1975) and disagreements about explaining development loomed large\n(Maienschein 1991). However, the famous example of vitalism in Hans\nDriesch\u2019s interpretation of development and the autonomy of the\norganism should be seen as an issue of epistemology as much as\nmetaphysics (Maienschein 2000). Instead of materialism versus vitalism\n(i.e., ontological reduction questions), the explanatory conflict\ninvolved the nature of differentiation in early ontogeny and to what\ndegree it is prespecified. The theme of order and organization in\nliving systems pervades many writings about methodological,\nepistemological, and ontological types of reductionism at this time\n(emphasizing both relations between physics and biology and between\nparts and wholes) (Esposito 2014, Peterson 2016). Examples include\nJoseph Needham\u2019s Order and Life (1936), Kurt\nGoldstein\u2019s The Organism (1934/1963), E.S.\nRussell\u2019s The Interpretation of Development and\nHeredity (1930), D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2019s On Growth and\nForm (1917), Ludwig von Bertalanffy\u2019s Modern Theories\nof Development (1933), and J.H. Woodger\u2019s Biological\nPrinciples (1929). Philosophers of science who have had less\ninfluence on contemporary Anglo-American philosophy were keenly aware\nof these discussions. For example,\n Ernst Cassirer\n (1950, Part II) explored reductionist themes related to causal\nexplanations of development, including the debates about mechanism and\nvitalism surrounding Driesch, as well as the relations between\nphysical science and biology. These topics also appeared in the pages\nof Philosophy of Science (e.g., Lillie 1934, 1942, 1948,\nSinger 1934, 1946), although not necessarily utilizing the specific\nterminology of reduction (Byron 2007).\n\nErnest Nagel\u2019s general treatment of reductionism in chapters 11\nand 12 of The Structure of Science (1961) canvassed many\ndifferent aspects of these perennial debates (Sarkar 2015). Whereas\nthe sections concerning theory reduction have usually been in view\n(connecting with the reductionist theme of relating domains of\nknowledge), Nagel also interacted with biological literature\naddressing claims about parts, wholes, and emergence, thereby\naddressing the second reductionist theme that has been prominent since\nAristotle (see Nagel 1961, 366ff). He highlighted the polysemy of\n\u201cwholes\u201d, \u201cparts\u201d, and \u201csums\u201d\ninherent in claims about success or failure in showing that the whole\nis just the sum of its parts (pp. 380ff). Additionally Nagel treats\nthe question of evolutionary emergence, i.e., whether genuinely new\nentities arise in the history of our universe and life on Earth (see\nGoudge 1961). He dealt with the aforementioned theoretical biologists\n(e.g., Bertalanffy, Russell, and Woodger) on the topic of hierarchical\norganization and reduction in living systems, especially as seen in\nontogeny (Nagel 1961, pp. 432ff). Nagel\u2019s contemporaries\nlikewise treated reductionist themes, though their work has largely\nbeen overlooked (e.g., Morton Beckner\u2019s discussion of\n\u201corganization\u201d and \u201clevels of analysis\u201d as\nmethodological and explanatory aspects of reduction; Beckner 1959, ch.\n9).\n\nDespite Nagel\u2019s wide-ranging analysis, most subsequent\nphilosophical discussion has concentrated on his formal account of\ntheory reduction (see\n Section 3.1),\n and whether it serves as an adequate general characterization of\nreductionism for all areas of scientific\n inquiry.[5]\n The biological case that has received the most scrutiny is the\nrelationship between classical and molecular genetics, in part because\nthe molecularization of genetics was palpable in this historical\nperiod (Schaffner 1969). The manifold difficulties encountered in\napplying Nagelian theory reduction to genetics (see\n Section 4)\n encouraged the growth of\n philosophy of biology\n as an independent disciplinary specialty, in part because these\ndifficulties seemed to fit a recurring pattern\u2014misconstruing\nbiological reasoning with philosophical accounts of science forged on\nphysical science examples (Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011).\nPhilosophical issues in biology seemed to require distinct analyses\nthat are more sensitive to empirical research in biology (Brigandt\n2011). Additionally, the rise of\n sociobiology\n and\n gene-centered\n evolutionary explanations provoked anti-reductionist stances among\nbiologists on the basis of social and political commitments (e.g.,\nLevins and Lewontin 1985).\n\nMore recent attention to reductionism in situ within\ndifferent life science contexts has led many philosophers to revisit\nthe perennial aspects of reductionism, many of which were simply\ntangential to controversies over theory reduction. A number of current\ndebates are unconscious returns to neglected issues, albeit in\ndifferent ways and in different contexts. That developmental biology\nhas returned to the center of discussions is not surprising because of\nits enduring status as a biological topic inviting reflection on\nreductionist themes. The same can be said for ecology and functional\nanatomy, although they remain more peripheral for many philosophers.\nSocially and politically tinged aspects of reductionist research in\nbiology, such as racial categorizations based on genetic profiles,\nalso continue to provoke philosophical analyses (see\n Section 5).\n3. Models of (Epistemic) Reduction\n\nMost discussion in contemporary philosophy of science has centered on\nthe issue of\n epistemic reduction\n (rather than ontological or methodological reduction; see\nHoyningen-Huene 1989). The basic idea that the knowledge (or other\nepistemic units) pertaining to one scientific domain can be reduced to\nanother body of knowledge (or its epistemic units) has been spelled\nout in different ways. It is useful to group different approaches to\nreduction into two basic categories: (1) models of\n theory reduction,\n which maintain that a higher level theory can be logically deduced\nfrom a lower level theory, and, (2) models of\n explanatory reduction,\n which focus on whether representations of higher level features can\nbe explained by representations of lower level features, typically by\ndecomposing a higher level system into parts (Sarkar 1992).\n Models of theory reduction\n were of primary interest in post-positivist philosophy of science\nthat emerged in the 1960s and have received the most sustained\nattention (Schaffner 1993). More recently, accounts of explanatory\nreduction have been developed to remedy the inadequacies of theory\nfocused accounts, so that theory reduction has been displaced as the\ncentral issue by competing accounts of explanatory reduction (but see\nDizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010 and Sarkar 2015).\n3.1 Theory Reduction\n\nAccording to theory reduction, theory \\(T_A\\) reduces \\(T_B\\)\n(e.g., \\(A\\)tomic physics reduces \\(B\\)iology) if \\(T_A\\) logically\nentails \\(T_B\\). Assuming a deductive-nomological account of\n explanation\n(Hempel and Oppenheim 1965 [1948]), theory reduction as deduction from\ntheoretical principles is an instance of explanation. In particular,\n\\(T_A\\) logically entails and explains the laws of \\(T_B\\). Compare\nthis with the logically weaker notion of reduction put forward by\nKemeny and Oppenheim (1956), which includes instances of theory\nreplacement. The Kemeny-Oppenheim model concerns the situation\nwhere the observable predictions made by \\(T_A\\) include (at least)\nall observable predictions of \\(T_B\\). In this case \\(T_A\\) can\nexplain everything that \\(T_B\\) explains, but \\(T_A\\) need not\nencompass the theoretical principles of \\(T_B\\) (as in genuine theory\nreduction), which allows for the possibility that \\(T_B\\) contains\ninadequate theoretical notions and is replaced by \\(T_A\\).\n\nMany models of theory reduction derive from the account of reduction\ndue to Ernest Nagel (1949, 1961). Working within the philosophical\nframework of logical empiricism, Nagel construed reduction as a\nlogical relation between theories, where a theory is understood as a\nsystem of statements, containing laws, formulated in a first-order\nformal language (Sarkar 2015). The reducing theory \\(T_A\\)\nreduces the reduced theory \\(T_B\\) if the laws of \\(T_B\\) can\nbe logically derived from \\(T_A\\), which Nagel called the\n\u201ccondition of derivability\u201d. However, if \\(T_B\\) contains\nscientific terms that do not occur in the language of the reducing\ntheory \\(T_A\\) (\u201corganismal reproduction\u201d is not an\nexpression of biochemistry), then derivability presupposes that the\nprimitive expressions of \\(T_B\\) (in particular, its predicates) can\nbe logically related to the language of \\(T_A\\). Nagel made this\nexplicit by a \u201ccondition of connectability\u201d: reduction\npresupposes that there are statements (e.g., conditionals) that\ncontain expressions both from \\(T_A\\) and \\(T_B\\), such that \\(T_A\\)\ntogether with these statements entail the laws of \\(T_B\\). These\nconnectability statements are often called bridge principles\n(or correspondence rules, or reduction functions), and have been\ninterpreted diversely. Nagel rejected the idea that bridge principles\nare analytic statements, but did not take a stand as to whether they\nare factual or conventional. Some philosophers have required that\nbridge principles are laws (rather than accidental generalizations),\nwhereas others have maintained that they should express metaphysical\nidentities between entities, properties, and processes (e.g.,\nidentifying cells with collections of molecules, in line with\nontological reduction). Nagel himself construed reduction as an\nepistemic notion without ontological commitment; nor did he require\nthat bridge statements be biconditionals\u2014mere conditionals when\nconjoined with \\(T_A\\) sometimes logically entail \\(T_B\\). (The\nKemeny-Oppenheim notion of reduction / theory replacement is weaker\nthan Nagelian reduction as it does not require such bridge principles\nconnecting \\(T_A\\) and \\(T_B\\).)\n\n\n This account covers interlevel theory reduction. For\ninstance, Oppenheim and Putnam (1958) argued for a hierarchical or\nlayered model of scientific disciplines that assumes each layer or\nlevel corresponds to a theory. Each discipline is reducible to the\ntheory on the next lower level, e.g., sociology to organismal biology,\norganismal biology to molecular biology, molecular biology to\nchemistry, and chemistry to microphysics (see also Brooks et al. 2021,\nWalter and Eronen 2011). Another way to apply Nagel\u2019s general\nmodel is successional theory reduction, where a historically\nearlier theory is reduced to a later, more mature theory, so that\nreduction can be an instance of theoretical progress (Nickles 1973).\nIn both cases, Nagel held that theories needed to be indexed to a\nparticular time: \u201cThe question whether a given science is\nreducible to another cannot in the abstract be usefully raised without\nreference to some particular stage of development of the two\ndisciplines\u201d (1961, 361).\n Paul Feyerabend\n (1962, 1965a, 1965b) and\n Thomas Kuhn\n (1962) criticized successional theory reduction and especially\nNagel\u2019s connectability condition. Feyerabend argued that an\nearlier and later theory might use the same theoretical term with a\ndifferent meaning (e.g., \u201cmass\u201d in classical and\nrelativistic mechanics). This\n incommensurability\n of meaning makes the connectability of these theories\u2019\nexpressions, and thus the logical derivation of one theory from\nanother, impossible. Whether or not genuine incommensurability obtains\nis controversial (see, e.g., Sankey 1994).\n\nNagel\u2019s model was revised and applied in a specifically\nbiological context\u2014the reduction of classical genetics to\nbiochemistry\u2014by Kenneth Schaffner (1967, 1969, 1976; see\nSchaffner 1993 for his mature account). Schaffner\u2019s\n\u201cGeneral Reduction Model\u201d addresses a key drawback of\nNagel\u2019s account, first noted by Feyerabend: even though the\ntheory to be reduced may be approximately true, it might contain\nempirically false statements, especially if it is a historical\nprecursor of the more mature reducing theory (e.g., the inheritance\n\u201claws\u201d of classical genetics have exceptions). If the\ntheory to be reduced \\((T_B)\\) contains false statements, then it\ncannot possibly be deduced from \\(T_A\\). For this reason, Schaffner\nconsiders instead \\(T_{B^*}\\), which is a corrected version\nof the theory to be reduced in that \\(T_{B^*}\\) makes more adequate\npredictions than \\(T_B\\). On this model, reduction occurs if \\(T_A\\)\nand \\(T_{B^*}\\) can be related by reduction functions (bridge\nprinciples) and \\(T_{B^*}\\) follows logically from \\(T_A\\) enriched by\nthe reduction functions.  (Whereas Nagel focused on the laws of\n\\(T_B\\) being deducible from \\(T_A\\), Schaffner requires that all\nstatements of \\(T_B /T_{B^*}\\) be deducible from \\(T_A\\).)\nSchaffner\u2019s central tenet about reduction in biology is that the\nsuccess of\n molecular biology\n shows that classical genetics and traditional fields of experimental\nbiology are in the process of being reduced to biochemistry. Although\nthis reduction has not been completed yet, a logical derivation of\ntraditional experimental biology from a (completed) theory of\nbiochemistry is in principle possible and will be achieved\neventually. Schaffner\u2019s account has an ontological aspect in\nthat he interprets the reduction functions as synthetic statements\nexpressing identities between the entities and processes of the two\ndomains related (in line with Sklar 1967 and Causey 1972a, 1972b),\nthough he does not argue that these identities are metaphysical\nnecessities. The Nagel-Schaffner approach to theory reduction assumes\na syntactic account of\n theory structure\n such that they are axiomatized systems formalizable in first order\npredicate calculus. A variety of other models of theory reduction\nexist, some of which use a semantic (i.e., theories as families of\n models)\n rather than a syntactic account of scientific theories (see Balzer\nand Dawe 1986a,b, Hooker 1981, Suppes 1957, Woodger 1952).\n\n\n Schaffner\u2019s account provided the motivation and point of\ndeparture for much of the reduction debate in philosophy of biology,\nwhich was conducted primarily in the 1970s and 80s and revolved around\nthe issue of whether (and in which sense)\n classical genetics can be reduced to molecular genetics\n or biochemistry. Three criticisms pertaining specifically to the\nNagel-Schaffner model bear mentioning.\n (Section 4\n reviews the main objections to different models of reduction more\ngenerally.)\n\n(a) Michael Ruse (1971) and David Hull (1974) argued that the relation\nbetween classical and molecular genetics is one of theory replacement,\nnot reduction in Schaffner\u2019s sense. Although Schaffner\u2019s\naccount permits a correction of the theory to be reduced \\((T_{B^*}\\)\ninstead of \\(T_B)\\), it is not clear when a modified version\n\\(T_{B^*}\\) (corrected \u201cclassical genetics\u201d) still counts\nas being largely similar to \\(T_B\\) (classical genetics). This leaves\nan ambiguity of whether one should conclude that \\(T_B\\) was reduced\nbecause \\(T_{B^*}\\) is similar enough or that \\(T_B\\) has been\nreplaced by another theory because the two are so dissimilar (Hull\n1976, Ruse 1976). Schaffner only requires that \\(T_B\\) and \\(T_{B^*}\\)\nare \u201cstrongly analogous\u201d (1993, 429), without offering a\nspecification of how much similarity is required for reduction rather\nthan replacement (Winther 2009). William Wimsatt (1976b) emphasizes\nthat while interlevel, compositional reductions are transitive,\nsuccessional reductions through history are intransitive, so that a\ncontinuum between genuine successional reduction and replacement\nobtains. Any sequence of successive reductions can be expected to\nevolve into an instance of replacement given enough time.\n\n(b) Nagel and Schaffner relied on a\n syntactic construal of theories,\n which assumes that a theory is a set of statements in a formal\nlanguage, including laws (Kitcher 1984). Yet it has been argued that\nmolecular biology as the reducing theory does not consist of a small\nbody of laws, so that a covering-law model of explanation and\nreduction is not applicable (Culp and Kitcher 1989, Kitcher 1984,\nSarkar 1998). If molecular biology or other biological fields are\ninadequately represented as consisting of a clearly delineated theory,\nreconstructed as a set of statements in a formal language, then an\naccount of reduction that presupposes this construal of scientific\ntheories is problematic.\n\n(c) Hull (1976), Wimsatt (1976a, 1976b), and Sahotra Sarkar (1992,\n1998) have objected that Schaffner focuses too much on formal\nconsiderations about reduction, rather than substantive issues. His\naccount construes reduction as a logical relation that is \u201cin\nprinciple\u201d possible even though it is not occurring in practice.\nIf reduction in this sense is not occurring in biology, then there are\nsignificant questions about whether it best fits biological knowledge\nand practice. Nagel claimed that premature attempts at reduction could\nretard scientific progress, thus implicitly decoupling methodological\ndemands from epistemological ones (Nagel 1961, 362\u20133). Schaffner\n(1974, 1993) acknowledges that reductionism in his sense has been\nperipheral to the practice of molecular biology, but maintains that\nhis formal model of reduction captures the reduction relation between\ntheories. Wimsatt (1979) suggests that Nagel\u2019s and\nSchaffner\u2019s focus on in-principle considerations and the context\nof justification, to the exclusion of in-practice considerations and\nthe context of discovery, leads to misunderstandings about the nature\nof reductionism debates, including historical and current controversy\namong scientists (see\n Section 2).\n Reduction may obtain between classical and molecular genetics, but\nnot in the sense of Nagel\u2019s or Schaffner\u2019s logical\nempiricist approach (Hull 1974).\n3.2 Explanatory Reduction\n\nA variety of explanatory reasoning patterns used by life scientists\nare now under scrutiny in philosophy of biology and theory reduction\nis no longer the primary focus. Various models of explanatory\nreduction focus on reductive explanation and differ from theory\nreduction (which is also a kind of explanation on the\ndeductive-nomological notion of explanation) in two important\nways:\n\n(a) Whereas theory reduction assumes that reduction is a relation\nbetween theories, models of explanatory reduction permit other\nfeatures as the relata of a reductive explanation, such as fragments\nof a theory, generalizations of varying scope, mechanisms, and even\nindividual facts. One approach pursued along these lines is due to\nKenneth Waters (1990, 1994, 2000). Instead of construing theory\nrelations in terms of the Nagel-Schaffner model, he identifies a key\nprinciple of inference operating in classical genetics and molecular\ngenetics: the \u201cdifference making principle\u201d (gene\ndifferences cause differences in phenotypes). This principle can be\nascribed to\n genes\n in both classical and molecular genetics. An explanatory reduction is\nachieved between them because their causal roles correspond. Waters\n(2008) extends this account by emphasizing how the investigative\npractices of classical genetics were \u201cretooled\u201d by\ndevelopments in molecular genetics, which accounts for the success of\nthe corresponding explanations.\n\nAnother example of explanatory reduction is due to Marcel Weber\n(2005). In line with models of theory reduction, Weber maintains that\nbiochemical (\u201cphysico-chemical\u201d) laws carry the\nexplanatory force, but that a fact or basic generality about\nbiological mechanisms (rather than a genuine law or a whole theory),\nsuch as the mechanism of action potentials in neurotransmission, is\nwhat is explained. By permitting reference to higher level structures\nin the explanans, such as axons, he does not require that a\nreductive explanation contain exclusively biochemical expressions.\n\n(b) A characteristic difference between theory reduction and\nexplanatory reduction stems from the fact that the\nformer\u2014focusing on the epistemic notion of logical\ndeduction\u2014does not incorporate the historically ubiquitous\nontological idea that a reduction explains the whole in terms of its\nparts (see, e.g., Winther 2011). Models of explanatory reduction\ntypically assume that reductive explanation is\n causal explanation,\n where a higher level feature is explained by the interaction of\nconstituent parts. Stuart Kauffman (1971) gave an early expression of\nthe idea that the search for explanations in experimental biology\nproceeds by decomposing an overall system into interacting parts.\nWimsatt (1976b) also recognized that this mapped more naturally onto\nthe language of biologists, especially the practice of discovering and\nelucidating mechanisms (see also Bechtel and Richardson 1993).\nMechanism approaches have now developed into a robust alternative to\ntheory reduction (see\n Section 5).\n Since many philosophers of biology and neuroscience conceive of\nexplanation as the description of\n mechanisms,\n accounts of explanatory reduction can rely on the notion of a\nmechanistic explanation (e.g., Delehanty 2005).\n\nModels of explanatory reduction avoid several problems facing theory\nreduction (see\n Section 3.1).\n Since explanatory reduction is not committed to the relata of an\nexplanation being theories involving laws, it can defend the\npossibility of reduction without formally reconstructing a clearly\ndelineated theory of molecular biology or classical genetics. Its\nfocus on reduction as explanation of a whole in terms of its parts\ncaptures a feature of actual molecular explanations. Whereas accounts\nof theory reduction have to acknowledge that reduction (in this sense)\nhas not yet been achieved and must appeal to its \u201cin\nprinciple\u201d possibility, accounts of explanatory reduction\ncomport well with the piecemeal nature of actual scientific research.\nExperimental and molecular biology can offer reductive explanations\neven if many facts remain unexplained and existing explanations still\nrequire more details to be filled in. Current biology effectively\nexplains individual facts and generalities of smaller scope, and the\nexplanans can be a mere fragment of a theory (see, e.g.,\nSchaffner 2006 on \u201cpatchy and fragmentary\u201d reductions).\nFinally, given that mechanistic explanations in experimental biology\nare preceded by and closely tied to the discovery of mechanisms\n(Craver and Darden 2013), explanatory reduction provides an account of\nreduction that can be related to scientific discovery, while\napproaches of theory reduction have to separate the context of\njustification (reduction and explanation) from the context of\ndiscovery.\n\nAn early model of explanatory reduction due to William Wimsatt (1976b)\nassumes that reduction is the causal explanation of an individual\nevent (rather than a generality), involving a\n\u201ccompositional redescription\u201d of a higher level state of\naffairs into some of its component features. This model is related to\nWesley Salmon\u2019s (1971) account of statistical explanation, which\nuses the notion of\n screening off\n to explicate the idea of one property being statistically more\nrelevant (and thus more explanatory) than another one. Wimsatt\nreplaces Salmon\u2019s statistical relevance with the idea of causal\nrelevance (as explanatory reduction in biology involves the search for\ncausally relevant factors), and he develops the notion of\n\u201ceffective screening off\u201d. Compositional redescription and\nexplanation in terms of lower level properties can have a greater\n\u201ccost\u201d of explanation (e.g., by being more complicated)\nthan the description in terms of the higher level property that is\neffectively screened off. A consequence of the epistemic\n\u201ccost\u201d requirement is that an explanatory reduction that\neffectively screens off a described higher level feature does not make\nit irrelevant and thus eliminable (as in Salmon\u2019s account)\nbecause it can be retained for pragmatic purposes.\n\n Sahotra\n Sarkar\u2019s (1998) detailed discussion of reductionism and\ngenetics offers several relevant conceptual clarifications. Focusing\non substantive issues about reduction in genetics (especially\nrepresentation, see\n Section 4.3),\n rather than formal considerations in a theory of reduction, Sarkar\ndevelops a view of explanatory reduction that is not committed to a\nparticular account of explanation. Two such basic types of reduction\nare \u201cabstract hierarchical reduction\u201d and \u201cstrong\nreduction\u201d (or spatial hierarchical reduction), where the\nlatter\u2014unlike abstract hierarchical reduction\u2014requires\nthat entities of a lower hierarchical level are physical parts of\nhigher level entities. (Each type of reduction can come in stronger\nand weaker forms as different kinds of approximations are involved in\ndifferent explanations.) Sarkar argues that explanations in\nclassical genetics, which explain phenotypic patterns in\nterms of classical genes, are abstract hierarchical reductions. The\nentities involved in this case are alleles, loci, linkage groups,\ngenotypes, and phenotypes, which stand in hierarchical relations\n(e.g., alleles \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) form genotype \\(Aa)\\), with individual\nalleles occupying the lowest level. However, this is an abstract\nrather than a spatial hierarchy; the assumption that \\(A\\) and \\(a\\)\nmap to \\(Aa\\) at the next higher level does not require \\(Aa\\) to be a\nphysical entity that has \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) as its spatial\nparts. Furthermore, the genotypic entities in this hierarchy are\ngoverned by various transformations and regularities (principles of\ninheritance), such as segregation, linkage, and mutation, which help\nto explain phenotypic patterns of inheritance. Although this abstract\nhierarchy can be interpreted as a spatial hierarchy by viewing\nclassical genes as being parts of chromosomes, Sarkar\u2019s point is\nthat the various practices in classical genetics, such as segregation\nand linkage analysis, did not require a physical interpretation of\ngenetic maps, and that explanations in terms of an abstract hierarchy\ncan be genuine reductions since they invoke a lower and thus more\nfundamental hierarchical level.\n\nRegarding spatial hierarchical reduction, Sarkar argues that this\nregularly occurs in molecular biology, where certain cellular\nfeatures are explained by macromolecular physics. The various\ncomponents of cells form nested part-whole relations, resulting in a\nspatial hierarchy. Many mechanisms of classical genetics can be\nreductively explained by the physical principles governing the\nbehavior of macromolecules (though approximations are still\nnecessary). Explanatorily relevant principles for the physics of\nmacromolecules include weak interactions, hydrogen bonding,\nhydrophobic bonding, allosteric transformations, lock-key fit, and the\nidea that structure determines function. Sarkar\u2019s central tenet\nis that the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of replication,\nrecombination, and cell division provide reductive explanations of the\nprinciples of classical genetics. Even though classical genetics\noffered an account of gene transmission and could rely on cytological\nexplanations, these accounts did not yield a complete explanation of\nhow and why recombination occurs. Molecular biology filled in this gap\nand corrected classical genetics.\n\nOther models of explanatory reduction have been put forward by\nphilosophers, many with an explicit eye to capturing how reduction\noccurs in scientific practice (e.g., Bickle 2003, 2006, 2008). In some\nways the most unique defense of explanatory reduction is found in the\nwork of Alex Rosenberg (2006), which departs from his earlier critical\nfocus on theory reduction (1978, 1985, 1994). First, according to his\nposition, strict laws (universal, exceptionless, spatio-temporally\nunrestricted) are required for explanation and the only candidate law\nin biology is the principle of natural selection (PNS). Second,\nwhy-necessary explanations are better than how-possible explanations\nin historical sciences such as biology, but why-necessary explanations\nare only available at the molecular level because structure becomes\ndecoupled from function above this level. Therefore, all how-possible\nexplanations in \u201cfunctional biology\u201d (i.e., non-molecular\nbiology), even those invoking the PNS, and any descriptions from\nfunctional biology involving higher levels of organization get\nexplained (why-necessarily) by the PNS operating on the molecular\nlevel (often occurring at some relatively distant point in\nevolutionary\n history).[6]\n\nMarie Kaiser (2011, 2015) has offered a thorough analysis of reductive\nexplanation, including a systematic treatment of metaphilosophical\nissues that underlie different approaches (see 2015, Chapter 2).\nInstead of arguing for or against reduction, she both articulates the\nadvantages of an explanation being reductive and indicates that many\nbiological phenomena cannot be explained in this way. On\nKaiser\u2019s account, an explanation is reductive if it has three\ncharacteristics: (1) lower-level, (2) internal, and (3)\nparts-in-isolation. \u201cLower-level\u201d means that the\nexplanation relies only on features that are at a lower level than the\nphenomenon being explained. Similar to Sarkar\u2019s hierarchical\naccount, a reduction does not have to be a molecular or lowest-level\nexplanation because Kaiser wants to capture reductive explanations\nthroughout biology, including ecology. Explanations with this\ncharacteristic provide an epistemically important unidirectional\n\u201cflow\u201d of explanation from the lower to the higher level,\neven if some of the relevant lower-level entities are not spatial\nparts of the explanandum phenomenon. However, Kaiser also\nrequires that reductive explanations appeal only to physical parts\n(\u201cinternal\u201d) of the explanandum phenomenon or\nsystem. Additionally, to fully qualify as reductive, an explanation\nmust represent each part it invokes in isolation\u2014not in\nisolation from any context, but rather in isolation from a\npart\u2019s original complex context. This\n\u201cparts-in-isolation\u201d characteristic is associated with a\nsystem being near-decomposable; upon decomposition, the actual\nfunctioning of a part can be understood in isolation. The whole\nsystem\u2019s operation then can be recomposed from the parts\ninteracting in a largely sequential and linear fashion (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993, Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2009). Using these three\ncharacteristics, one can classify different explanations and\ndistinguish a reductive explanation from a mechanistic explanation or\nfrom a part-whole explanation (Kaiser 2015, ch. 6).\n4. Problems with Reductionism\n\nDifferent accounts of theory reduction and explanatory reduction face\nseveral potential problems. Some critiques of (epistemic) reductionism\nemphasize that the effects of molecular processes strongly depend on\nthe context in which they occur, so that one molecular kind\ncan correspond to many higher level kinds\n (Section 4.1).\n Another significant challenge to reductionism stems from the fact\nthat higher level biological structures and processes can be (and\ntypically are) realized by different kinds of molecular processes, so\nthat many molecular kinds can correspond to one\nhigher level kind\n (Section 4.2).\n Finally, because biological processes must be represented before they\ncan be explained (Sarkar 1998), two further features become salient as\nissues for explanatory reduction: temporality and intrinsicality\n (Section 4.3).\n4.1 Context-Dependence of Molecular Features (one-many)\n\nOne key challenge for reduction stems from the fact that the effect of\na molecular entity or mechanism may depend strongly on the\ncontext in which it occurs (Hull 1972, 1974, 1976; see also\nWimsatt 1979, Gilbert and Sarkar 2000, Laubichler and Wagner 2001).\nClassical geneticists were fully aware of the fact that a phenotype is\nbrought about by the interaction of several (many) classical\ngenes\u2014the same allele may lead to two different phenotypes if\noccurring in two individuals with a different overall genotype (Waters\n2004). Although one-many phenomena have been known for some time, it\nis now a robust empirical generalization that a molecular pathway may\nhave different effects in different cellular contexts; the same\npathway can be involved in different functions in different species or\nin different parts of an individual (Gilbert and Sarkar 2000,\nLaubichler and Wagner 2001, Burian\n 2004).[7]\n These different contexts include developmental and physiological\nhistory, which condition the behavior of molecular pathways (Brigandt\n2006, Kirschner 2005). Even the amino acid sequence produced by a\nmolecular gene may depend on both DNA elements outside of the gene and\nnon-genetic factors, which means the same gene can code for distinct\nproducts in different cells or different states of a cell (Griffiths\nand Stotz 2013, Stotz 2006a,b). Thus, there are one-many relations\nbetween molecular kinds and higher level kinds: a molecular mechanism\ncan causally lead to or be part of different higher level states\ndepending on the\n context.[8]\n\nA common conclusion drawn from these one-many relations is that the\nparts and molecular components of an\n organism\n have to be understood in terms of the organized whole in which they\noccur (recall Kant\u2019s regulative principle;\n Section 2).\n Although biologists view the decomposition of a system into\nlower-level parts as reductionist (an instance of methodological\nreduction, see\n Section 1),\n they often construe the attempt to understand how the parts are\norganized to bring about the system-level properties as a synthetic,\nnon-reductionist endeavor (Bechtel 2010, 2013). Paying attention to\ncontext and organismal organization is a valid methodological\nrecommendation; however, it is less clear why this is an argument\nagainst epistemic reduction. For example, proponents of\ntheory reduction, such as Nagel (1961) and Schaffner (1976), have\nreplied that a molecular reduction can take the relations of parts and\nthe context of molecular processes into account. For example, one can\nspecify the relevant context as initial conditions in the molecular\npremises from which the higher level state is to be deduced\n(Frost-Arnold 2004).\n\nContext-dependence is primarily a problem for models of theory\nreduction; some models of explanatory reduction take the organismal\ncontext for granted without being committed to reducing it molecularly\n(as seen in explanations offered in developmental biology). Sciences\ncan avail themselves of\n causes as difference makers\n relative to a given causal context (Waters 2007, Woodward 2003). Both\nexperimental investigation and explanation can focus on one among many\ncauses, relegating everything else to the context or background (which\nis often held fixed in experimental studies). For example, if the loss\nin function of a particular gene leads to an abnormal phenotype in a\nknock-out experiment, this gene is one causal factor\nimplicated in the development of the normal phenotype. Explanations\nappealing to this gene\u2014as a salient causal factor relative to a\ncontext\u2014are genuinely explanatory even if other genes involved\nin the phenotype are unknown and the cellular context for the gene is\nnot yet understood (Waters 1994, 2007). If molecular biologists\ndiscover that the same mechanism produces different effects in\ndistinct contexts and only one of these effects is the target of\ninquiry, a part of the mechanism\u2019s context becomes epistemically\nrelevant and can be included in the explanation (Delehanty 2005).\n\nIn contrast, theory reduction (such as the Nagel-Schaffner approach)\nis committed to deducing a description of the higher level phenomenon\nfrom purely molecular premises. In order to deduce even a single\nhigher level statement (a fortiori a total higher level\ntheory on Schaffner\u2019s account), the premises must contain (in\naddition to the lower level laws) a specification of the total lower\nlevel context\u2014every feature that has some\ncausal impact. This includes features internal to an organism and some\nparts of its environment. While explanatory reduction can appeal to\nparticular causes relative to a background that is not molecularly\nspecified, a logical deduction (as required by theory reduction) can\ngo through only if the total causal context is contained in the\n premises.[9]\n A molecular characterization of the total context is in principle\npossible due to ontological reduction: for any higher level state\nthere is always a total molecular configuration that determines this\nhigher level phenomenon. However, this entails a retreat to the\n\u201cin principle\u201d possibility of a molecular derivation; not\nonly is a molecular specification of the total context currently\nunavailable but it may not be forthcoming in the future (Hull 1972,\n1974,\n 1976).[10]\n In this respect, accounts of explanatory reduction have a clear\nadvantage over models of theory reduction because the former are\ncommitted neither to formal derivation nor the assumption that the\nexplanans of the reductive explanation involves only\nmolecularly characterized notions.\n\nAlthough context-dependence is not a problem for many models of\nexplanatory reduction, issues can arise for some models of mechanistic\nexplanation. A mechanistic approach decomposes a system into\ncomponents and scrutinizes the functioning of each component in\nisolation (where possible). However, a mechanistic explanation must\nalso epistemically \u201crecompose\u201d the mechanism behavior (the\nexplanandum) from these component functions (Bechtel 2010,\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2009). There are molecular systems consisting\nof highly interconnected and functionally integrated networks whose\ncomplex organization does not permit a recomposition of the system\nbehavior from the component functions studied in isolation (Green et\nal. 2018, Kaiser 2015). The functioning of individual components is\ntransformed by the many influences of the other components. This\nempirical situation also is important because it stands behind many\ninstances where molecular biologists claim a limit of\n\u201creduction\u201d\u2014these complex system interactions lead\nto emergence (in some sense). This highlights that biologists\nfrequently attempt to account for mechanism functioning or system\ndynamics and not just mereological or structural constitution (e.g.,\nreducing the Mendelian kind \u201cgene\u201d to biochemical\nkinds).\n\nJason Robert\u2019s (2004) treatment of explanation and methodology\nin\n developmental biology\n describes what is probably the main valid point stemming from the\ncontext-dependence of molecular features. While acknowledging the\nlegitimacy of reductionist research strategies that isolate molecular\ncauses relative to a background held fixed for experimental purposes,\nRobert emphasizes that this methodology does not license an inference\nto an exclusively reductionist position where all explanatorily\nrelevant causes are molecular. That developmental genetics uncovers\nvarious differences between individuals that are due to differences in\ngene expression does not entail that genes are the only factors\nrelevant in ontogeny. Since genetic research holds other cellular and\norganismal factors fixed, the causal influence of these non-genetic\nresources is simply not assessed by this research method. It\nbegs the question against those who maintain that some explanations of\ndevelopment must invoke higher level features to assert that the\norganismal context can always be described molecularly. For example,\nan appeal to developmental genetics research success alone is\ninadequate for reducing cellular context to molecular causes because\nthe discovery of genetic causes occurs against a fixed organismal\nbackground (Robert 2004). The dependence of molecular features on\ncellular and organismal contexts poses problems for theory reduction\napproaches maintaining that higher level phenomena can be deduced from\npurely molecular premises. (It is also a problem for claims that the\nembryo can be computed from a purely molecular specification of the\nfertilized egg, as endorsed by Rosenberg 1997; see Keller 2002, ch.\n9.) Thus, there are limitations on the kinds of inferences that can be\ndrawn from reductionist research strategies. What remains missing from\nmany philosophical discussions critical of reduction is an explicit\naccount of methodological strategies and epistemological frameworks\nthat both capture actual scientific reasoning and offer an alternative\nto reductionism (Love 2008a; see\n Section 5).\n4.2 Multiple Realization of Higher Level Features (Many-One)\n\nIn addition to the one-many relation between molecular and higher\nlevel kinds, Hull (1972, 1974, 1976) also pointed to the existence of\nmany-one relations as a challenge for reductionism. The same higher\nlevel phenomenon (e.g., a Mendelian trait such as coat color) can be\nproduced by several different molecular mechanisms or a higher level\nphenomenon is realized by different kinds of molecular configurations\n (multiple realization).\n This is a potential problem for both theory reduction and explanatory\nreduction (though to differing degrees). In defense of his model of\ntheory reduction, Schaffner (1976) replies that it is sufficient to\nspecify one such molecular situation. Then the higher level situation,\nwhich is determined by the molecular constellation, can be derived\nlogically from this molecular specification of the higher level\nsituation. However, one has to be clear about the nature of the\nexplanandum in a reductive explanation (i.e., what is the\nconsequent of a reductive deduction). Is it a type of higher\nlevel phenomenon (described by higher level predicates) or merely a\ntoken phenomenon (an instance of a higher level phenomenon)?\nTheory reduction is the idea that a whole theory (such as classical\ngenetics) can be reduced, or at least that its laws can be reduced.\nFor example, the Mendelian principle of segregation is a law\ndescribing a phenomenon occurring in all sexually reproducing\norganisms, not just a token phenomenon, so this general\nprinciple\u2014covering various lower level realizations\u2014would\nhave to be explained/deduced molecularly.\n\nConsider the example that Schaffner (1993) offers in support of the\npossibility of reduction: the Mendelian concept of\n\u201cdominance\u201d. On his account, given classical genes \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), the property \u201callele \\(a\\) is dominant (relative to\nallele \\(b)\\)\u201d can be expressed in molecular terms as\nfollows. Assume that genotype \\(aa\\) yields phenotype \\(A\\) and\ngenotype \\(bb\\) corresponds to phenotype \\(B\\), while \\(ab\\) yields\n\\(A\\) (because of dominance). We ascertain that gene \\(a\\) consists of\nDNA sequence \\(\\alpha\\) and gene \\(b\\) consists of DNA sequence\n\\(\\beta\\), and that phenotype \\(A\\) is brought about by protein\n\u05d0 while phenotype \\(B\\) is brought about by protein\n\u05d1. This yields the following supposed reduction:\n\nAllele \\(a\\) is dominant (relative to \\(b)\\) iff the\npresence of two copies of DNA sequence \\(\\alpha\\) molecularly produces\nprotein \u05d0 [thus phenotype \\(A\\)], the presence of two\ncopies of sequence \\(\\beta\\) produces protein \u05d1 [phenotype\n\\(B\\)], and the presence of one copy of \\(\\alpha\\) and one copy of\n\\(\\beta\\) produces \u05d0 [phenotype \\(A\\)]. (Schaffner 1993, 442)\n\n\nAlthough Schaffner explicitly claims to have shown that the\npredicate (or concept of) \u201cdominance\u201d can be\nreduced to the language of biochemistry, his evidence actually shows\nhow a single instance of dominance (allele \\(a\\) is\ndominant to allele \\(b)\\) could be brought about by states on the\nmolecular level. But epistemic reduction requires reducing higher\nlevel concepts and, since Mendelian dominance can be brought about by\ndifferent kinds of molecular situations, this higher level\npredicate corresponds to many molecular predicates,\nwhich makes any reductive translation of higher level concepts very\ncomplex. (In addition to translating such concepts into molecular\nterms, theory reduction also requires deducing higher level\ngeneralizations involving such concepts.) A similar issue can apply to\nexplanatory reduction. Biology attempts to explain kinds of\nphenomena occurring in different contexts and organisms: reductive\nexplanations must molecularly explain kinds of phenomena in\naddition to single instances.\n\nSubsequent discussion based on ideas in metaphysics and\n philosophy of mind\n has clarified how one conception of the many-one relation between\nmolecular and higher level kinds can bear on epistemic reduction. In\nhis general treatment of reduction in psychology and social science,\nJerry Fodor (1974, 1975, 1997) distinguishes between token-token\nreduction and type-type reduction (or between token\nphysicalism and type physicalism). Token-token reduction is the idea\nthat each token higher level property or process is\nmetaphysically identical to a token physico-chemical property or\nprocess (the weak sense of ontological reduction that is\nuncontroversial: see\n Section 1).\n The dispute centers on how much more than token-token reduction is\npossible. A substantially stronger idea is that each type of\nhigher level phenomenon corresponds to one type of lower\nlevel phenomenon. Type-type reduction yields a bold version of\nepistemic reductionism where higher level concepts and\nknowledge about higher level phenomena could be immediately reduced to\nmolecular notions. Yet Fodor argues that type-type reduction\n(regarding mental and social kinds in particular) is empirically\nfalse. Consider a simple law or causal principle of a higher-level\nscience relating two kinds, \\(S\\) and \\(T\\), such that \\(\\forall x(Sx\n\\rightarrow Tx)\\), which can be read as \u201call \\(S\\)s are\n\\(T\\)s\u201d or \u201call events of type \\(S\\) bring about events of\ntype \\(T\\)\u201d. (Some laws or principles might be of a more complex\nlogical form.) As a matter of fact, a higher level kind is often\nrealized by several different kinds on the physical level; different\ninstances of the higher level kind are of a different type on the\nmolecular level. If kind \\(S\\) is realized by the lower level kinds\n\\(M_1, M_2 , \\ldots ,M_i\\), the bridge principle (reduction function)\nis of a disjunctive form:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x (Sx \\leftrightarrow (M_1 x \\vee M_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee M_i x))\n\\]\n\n\n\\(T\\) is likewise multiply realized, say by the molecular kinds \\(N_1,\nN_2 , \\ldots ,N_j\\). Fodor\u2019s point is that the lower level basis\nof the higher level law \\(\\forall x(Sx \\rightarrow Tx)\\) consists in\nseveral laws that reduce different higher level instances, such\nas:\n\n\\[ \n\\forall x(M_1 x \\rightarrow N_3 x), \\forall x(M_2 x \\rightarrow N_1\nx), \\forall x(( M_3 x \\vee M_4 x) \\rightarrow N_2 x),\\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nThus, while on the higher level there is one unified law\n\\(\\forall x (Sx \\rightarrow Tx)\\),\nits translation into molecular terms is a disjunctive\nstatement:\n\n\\[\n\\forall x ((M_1 x \\vee M_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee M_i x) \\rightarrow (N_1\nx \\vee N_2 x \\vee \\ldots \\vee N_j x))\n\\]\n\n\nThis disjunctive statement has the appearance of being a gerrymandered\ncombination rather than a genuine law. Therefore, the higher level law\ncannot be reduced to a unified lower level law. Token-token\nreduction obtains, but since the natural kinds (to which laws apply)\nof the higher level science cross-cut the kinds of the lower level\nscience, type-type reduction fails and the law-based explanation from\nthe higher level cannot be replaced by a unified law-based explanation\non the lower level. Steven Kimbrough (1978) argues that this situation\nalso applies to the relation between classical and molecular genetics:\nontological (token-token) reduction is possible, but not epistemic\n(type-type)\n reduction.[11]\n\nThe multiple realizability of higher level kinds is typically viewed\nas an obstacle to reduction (e.g., Kincaid 1997), and many have\ninterpreted the many-one relation between molecular and higher level\nphenomena in a similar way. Rosenberg\u2019s earlier discussions that\ncriticized theory reduction in light of multiple realization (1978,\n1985, 1994) used the notion of\n supervenience,\n which is another way to spell out an idea of ontological without\nepistemic reduction\n (non-reductive physicalism).[12]\n Higher level facts supervene on physical facts if any difference\nbetween two higher level situations implies a difference in the\nphysical basis. Yet this is consistent with two distinct physical\nsituations corresponding to the same higher level state (many-one).\nSince biological properties such as fitness supervene on physical\nproperties, fitness can be nothing more than a combination of physical\nproperties, even though no such property complex is necessary for\nhaving a particular fitness value. Higher level theories abstract away\nfrom irrelevant variation in lower level features and thereby arrive\nat generalizations that are explanatory precisely because they do not\ninclude features irrelevant to explaining the phenomenon (Putnam 1975,\nStrevens 2008). From this perspective, theory reduction of classical\nto\n molecular genetics\n is impossible as the many\u2013many relations between classical and\nmolecular kinds make any reductive account radically disjunctive. At\nthe same time, the notion of supervenience implies that classical and\nmolecular genetics are not incommensurable, and that molecular\ngenetics can shed light on the exceptions of classical genetics.\n\nA related critique of reductionism in genetics is due to Philip\nKitcher (1984). It is not that the complexities of any reduction due\nto many-one relations between molecular and higher level kinds exceed\nour cognitive capacities. Rather, the reductive, molecular\naccount does not adequately explain because it does not involve the\nnatural kinds that underlie the appropriate causal relations.\nPrinciples of classical genetics (e.g., segregation) are explained by\ncellular processes (e.g., the behavior of chromosomes in meiosis)\nbecause the higher level kinds picked out by cytology are causally\nrelevant. Rephrasing these cellular processes in molecular terms leads\nto an account that mentions various disjunctive combinations of\nmolecular kinds, while failing to exhibit the unified kinds that are\nthe causes of the cellular process. A key aspect of Kitcher\u2019s\nargument is that an epistemic account of reduction fails for\nontological reasons: it does not capture the natural kind structure of\nchromosomal phenomena studied by classical genetics.\n\nSchaffner\u2019s reply to the multiple realization objection (1993,\n463\u20136) emphasizes that the same DNA sequence can be present in\nmany individuals, which means that molecular biology studies more than\ntoken phenomena; molecular generalizations apply to\nrestricted types. This is true but fails to address the core\nissue. Critics of reductionism do not argue that each higher level\ntype corresponds to several lower level tokens (which is\ntrivially true) or that molecular biology can study token phenomena\nonly. Rather, the point is that a higher level type corresponds to\nseveral lower level types, and for each of these lower level\nkinds a distinct molecular account obtains. Thus, a unified (as\nopposed to disjunctive) causal explanation of the higher level\nphenomenon appears impossible.\n\nWaters (1990) challenges the commitment to unification that implies\nthere is explanatory loss in appealing to the multiply realized\n\u201cgory details\u201d of molecular biology. In some cases,\ndisjunctive explanations at a lower level seem to explain better than\nunified explanations at higher levels. Elliott Sober (1999) extends\nthis line of argument: an explanation in terms of higher level kinds\ncan be more unified or general by encompassing heterogeneous lower\nlevel kinds, but this same heterogeneity exhibits important\ndifferences in scientifically interesting properties. Only the lower\nlevel science can account for such differences and therefore, in this\nsense, offers a deeper explanation than the higher level science.\nExplanations are not better or worse along a one-dimensional scale.\nThere are several epistemic virtues an explanation can possess, such\nas generality, depth, or specificity. Sometimes a lower level\nexplanation is better relative to one epistemic virtue, while a higher\nlevel explanation is preferable relative to another, such as\nunification. And unification itself can be explicated differently in\nterms of functional or structural features of biological systems (see,\ne.g., Weiskopf\n 2011).[13]\n\nMany contemporary accounts of explanatory reduction focus on\n mechanisms\n and the study of\n model organisms.\n One reply to the multiple realization objection from this perspective\nargues explicitly for token-token reduction, discussing how the causal\ndescription of a token mechanism explains (Delehanty 2005). Weber\n(2005) acknowledges that higher level features are multiply realizable\nbut notes that this does not hamper the reducibility of token systems\nor individual organisms: \u201cthe fact that chemotactic behavior is\nmultiply realizable does not affect the reductionistic explanation of\nthis organism\u2019s behavioral biology\u201d (48).\nHowever, this stratagem ignores the key point of contention because\ntoken-token reduction is uncontroversial. The focus on token phenomena\nor individual organisms fails to address an important epistemological\nfeature of scientific knowledge: explanations often cover\ntypes of phenomena. In many biological contexts, such as\n developmental biology,\n the intellectual aim is to explain phenomena instantiated in\nmany organisms and the use of model organisms is predicated on this\n aim.[14]\n Any version of epistemic reductionism has to address this feature of\nscientific explanation to be adequate. Explaining development\u2014as\nunderstood by many developmental biologists\u2014means to have an\naccount of ontogeny exhibited by individual organisms belonging to a\nlarger group (e.g., understanding the developmental principles that\ngovern vertebrate or amphibian development). As the\nsame morphological structure may develop in different species by means\nof different processes and based on the action of different genes,\nmultiple realization obtains and is relevant for such explanations\n(Laubichler and Wagner 2001).\n\nMoreover, even if the aim is to explain a feature of a single\norganism, it does not follow that an explanation should appeal\nexclusively to factors on the lowest level. An explanation should only\ninclude factors that are explanatorily relevant; an irrelevant factor\nis one whose omission from (or modification in) the explanation does\nnot prevent the explanandum from following (Strevens 2008).\nThis also holds for mechanistic explanation, which should cite those\nfeatures as components of a mechanism whose modification would make a\ncausal difference to the explanandum phenomenon (Craver\n2007). For instance, chromosomes are relevant parts of the mechanisms\n(\u201cworking entities\u201d) needed to explain Mendelian patterns\nof inheritance (Darden 2005), but this particular explanation will\napply regardless of the lower level, molecular composition of the\nchromosomes (e.g., whether or not the various genes have similar or\nvery different DNA sequences).\n\nIn the context of developmental biology, even during the development\nof a single organism, a structure may be present across time and have\na stable developmental-functional role, but its underlying molecular\nand cellular basis may change (Brigandt 2006, Kirschner 2005).\nEntities above the molecular level can be more robust so that when\nsome molecular processes change or break down these higher level\nentities are not modified or removed. Knocking out a gene need not\nhave any impact on ontogeny due to genetic redundancy, while\neliminating a particular cell or group of cells may dramatically\ninterfere with normal development (Brigandt 2013a, 2015, Mitchell\n2009). A higher level causal connection can be more salient in that\nthe regular operation of the mechanism strongly depends on the\npresence of this kind of causal relation. Such a higher level causal\nrelation is realized by molecular entities and their interactions\n(i.e., supervenience obtains), but if relevant higher level processes\nare less sensitive to disturbance or intervention than certain\nmolecular causes, the more powerful mechanistic explanation can be the\none that appeals to more robust, higher level causal connections. This\nis one reason why some biological sciences preferentially invoke\nhigher level entities and processes in the face of multiple\nrealization, explaining in terms of higher level natural kinds and\ncauses.\n\nIn summary, the level(s) of organization a successful explanation\naddresses often depends on the particular explanandum. If the\naim is to explain a type of phenomenon, multiple realization issues\n(many-one relations) are likely pertinent. In the explanation of a\ntoken phenomenon, the explanation should include lower level factors\nonly to the extent that they are explanatorily relevant for that\nparticular explanandum.\n4.3 Representation, Temporality, and Intrinsicality\n\nSarkar\u2019s (1998) account of explanatory reduction draws attention\nto the requirement of representation: natural phenomena must be\nsymbolized, embodied, pictured, or designated through media such as\nequations, scale miniatures, or abstract diagrams (Abrahamsen et al.\n2018, Bechtel et al. 2018, Potochnik 2017, Sheredos and Bechtel 2020).\nEvery reductive explanation in science involves representations of the\nsystems or features to be related by reduction. (Note that this is not\nthe question of how theory structure is represented; see, e.g.,\nSchaffner 1996.) Almost all of the discussion surrounding one-many\n (Section 4.1)\n and many-one problems\n (Section 4.2)\n for theory and explanatory reduction assume or presume particular\nrepresentations that directly impact the arguments offered (e.g., they\ninvolve approximations of different kinds). Sarkar distinguishes three\nrepresentational criteria for a reductive explanation: (i)\nfundamentalism: the explanation of the phenomenon relies entirely on\nfeatures that pertain to a more fundamental realm; (ii) abstract\nhierarchy: the system is represented as a hierarchy, where the lower\nlevels are regarded as more fundamental; and, (iii) spatial hierarchy:\nthe abstract hierarchy is rendered physical by the requirement that\nthe entities on the lower level are (spatial) parts of the entities at\nhigher levels (see\n Section 3.2).\n Whether or not there are one-many or many-one relations between\ndifferent hierarchical levels turns on the nature of the hierarchy\ninvoked and how it is characterized. The decomposition of a system is\nnot a univocal enterprise and, depending on the principles utilized,\ncan generate both competing and complementary sets of part\nrepresentations from the same system (Craver 2009, Kauffman 1971,\nWimsatt 1974, Winther 2011). Certain governing principles are often\nvisible, such as functional versus structural decompositions (Bechtel\nand Richardson 1993, Winther 2006). Therefore, prior to determinations\nof whether reductive explanations succeed or fail, questions of\nrepresentational choice and adequacy need to be addressed\nexplicitly.\n\nThese representational issues are not idle with respect to differing\nexplanations, both past and present, because the same line of argument\nabout the non-independence of organismal parts constituted reasons for\ntreating the organism from a non-reductionist standpoint (Aristotle,\nParts of Animals II.3, Owen, Hunterian Lectures [1837] in\nSloan 1992, 213\u20134). Individuation of parts and their explanatory\nrelationship to wholes is critically dependent on the principles\nutilized in representing them (Love 2012). Wimsatt (1974, 1986, 1997,\n2007) has claimed that reduction and emergence are compatible within\nthe context of explaining organizational complexity in living systems,\ngoing so far as to argue that reductionist methodology can identify\nemergence when specific conditions of aggregativity are delineated.\nDifferent failures of aggregativity result when different conditions\nare not met, which yields a subtle taxonomy of compositional\nrelations, as well as highlighting that different decompositions\nproduce distinct fulfillments and/or violations of those conditions\nthat can be methodologically exploited by scientists for the purpose\nof causal discovery.\n\nIn addition to individuation, two other issues related to\nrepresentation are germane: temporality and intrinsicality\n(H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011). In most discussions of epistemic\nreduction, both theoretical and explanatory, no explicit distinction\nhas been drawn between constitutional or spatial relations\n(arrangements) and causal or temporal relations (dynamics; but see\nMitchell 2009, 2012). One source of the focus on spatial relations is\nthe objection to reductionism from structural organization (Polanyi\n1968, cf. Delehanty 2005, Frost-Arnold 2004, Schaffner 1993, ch. 9.2),\nwhich is related to the \u201ccontext\u201d objection\n (Section 4.1).\n Moreover, physical science models that serve as templates for\nthinking about reduction emphasize spatial composition questions\nrather than causal relations (Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011). As\nSchaffner has remarked: \u201cBiological theories are usually given\nin the form of a series of temporal (and frequently causal) models. In\nphysics, time is usually eliminated by making it implicit in\ndifferential equations, whereas in biology a temporal process \u2026\nis the rule\u201d (1993, 83\u20134, cf. Kellert 1993, 93). Nagel\npresciently recognized differences between spatial and temporal\norganization in his discussion of teleological explanation (in part\nbecause he was reading the literature on explaining ontogeny by\ntheoretical biologists; see\n Section 2).\n\nThe contrast between structure and function is evidently a contrast\nbetween the spatial organization of anatomically\ndistinguishable parts of an organ and the temporal (or\nspatiotemporal) organization of changes in those parts. What is\ninvestigated under each term of the contrasting pair is a mode of\norganization or a type of order. In the one case the organization is\nprimarily if not exclusively a spatial one, and the object of the\ninvestigation is to ascertain the spatial distribution of organic\nparts and the modes of their linkage. In the other case the\norganization has a temporal dimension, and the aim of the inquiry is\nto discover sequential and simultaneous orders of change in the\nspatially ordered and linked parts of organic bodies. (Nagel 1961,\n426)\n\n\nKitcher also glimpsed the potential significance of temporality for\nreductive explanation in the context of embryology: \u201cBecause\ndevelopmental processes are complex and because changes in the timing\nof embryological events may produce a cascade of effects at several\ndifferent levels, one sometimes uses descriptions at higher levels to\nexplain what goes on [later] at a more fundamental level\u201d (1984,\n371).\n\nA very different distinction utilizing time, which is agreed upon by\ndiverse participants, distinguishes between the historical succession\nof theories via reduction (\u201cdiachronic reduction\u201d) and\ncurrent attempts to relate parts to wholes, such as in explanatory\nreduction or interlevel theory reduction (\u201csynchronic\nreduction\u201d; see\n Section 3.1).\n\nSynchronic reduction is mereological explanation, in which the\nbehavior of more composite items described in reduced theories is\nexplained by derivation from the behavior of their components by the\nreducing theory. Thus, reduction is a form of explanation. Diachronic\nreduction usually involves the succession of more general theories\nwhich reduce less general ones, by showing them to be special cases\nwhich neglect some variables, fail to measure coefficients, or set\nparameters at restricted values. As the history of science proceeds\nfrom the less general theory to the more general, the mechanism of\nprogress is the reduction of theories. (Rosenberg 2006, 28)\n\n\nThe first distinction to note is that between synchronic and\ndiachronic conceptions of reductionism. The term reduction is\noften used to refer to the relation between a theory and its\nhistorical successor. \u2026 This is \u2026 what I mean by\ndiachronic reductionism. My concern, on the other hand, is solely with\nsynchronic reductionism, that is to say, with the relations between\ncoexisting theories addressed to different levels of organization.\n(Dupr\u00e9 1993, 94\u20135)\n\n\nWhat this distinction misses is the possibility of diachronic aspects\nof part-whole or interlevel relations. Scientific explanations\ncommonly invoke dynamic (causal) processes involving entities on\nseveral levels of organization (Craver and Bechtel 2007). This is one\nof the core reasons why development is a persisting biological topic\nfor reductionism. During ontogeny there are causal interactions over\ntime among parts and activities (both homogeneous and heterogeneous)\nto bring about new parts and activities (both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous), eventually generating an integrated adult (whole)\norganism.\n\nTemporality can be added as a fourth criterion on representations for\nreductive explanations: (iv) temporal hierarchy: for an abstract\nhierarchy embedded in an explanation, the entities and their behaviors\non the lower level are temporally prior to the entities and their\nbehaviors at the higher levels (H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011).\nAlthough temporal or process hierarchies have not received the same\nattention as spatial hierarchies (such as in Wimsatt\u2019s\naggregativity criteria), their importance is seen in explanations that\ninvoke higher level features (e.g., tissue interactions during\nontogeny) at an earlier time to causally explain lower level features\nat a later time (e.g., gene expression patterns). For example, a study\nof the developmental origin of aortic arch asymmetry involves a\nmixture of reductionist and non-reductionist representations according\nto the criterion of temporality (Yashiro et al. 2007; see also Love\n2017). The explanation depicts several events in a sequential process.\nFirst, fundamental level properties (gene expression) change\nnon-fundamental level properties (arterial structure), which alters\nblood flow dynamics (thereby fulfilling the temporality condition).\nThese new dynamics induce a subsequent change in gene expression\n(thereby violating the temporality condition). This altered gene\nexpression then produces the non-fundamental property of interest,\naortic arch asymmetry (thereby fulfilling the temporality condition).\nThus, depending on how time is represented and which temporal\npartitions are utilized, an explanation may be reductive,\nnon-reductive, or both. This is a good example of how ontological and\nepistemic reduction can yield strikingly different answers. A\nbiologist using a higher level feature at an earlier time to explain a\nlower level feature at a later time (a non-reductionist explanation by\nthe criterion of temporality) is not denying that this higher level\nfeature is composed of lower level features (e.g., cells and\nmolecules), nor the possibility that the higher level feature was\ncaused by a different set of lower level features at some more distal\npoint in time.\n\nAnother example is found in protein folding within molecular biology\n(H\u00fcttemann and Love 2011). Functional proteins are folded\nstructures composed of amino acid components linked together into a\nlinear chain. If we ask whether the folded protein is mereologically\ncomposed of its amino acid parts given current representations in\nmolecular biology, then the affirmative answer seems to favor\nexplanatory reduction with respect to the spatial hierarchy. But if we\nask whether the linear amino acid chain folds into a functional\nprotein (a causal process with a temporal dimension) purely as a\nconsequence of its linked amino acid parts, then the answer is less\nclear. Empirical studies have discerned a necessary role for other\nfolded proteins to assist in the proper folding of newly\ngenerated linear amino acid chains (Frydman 2001). That the linked\namino acid components alone are insufficient causally, even if they\nare sufficient constitutionally, allows for a more explicit\nappreciation of the significance of temporality and dynamics (Mitchell\n2009), especially because the relations of interest concern only\nmolecular biological phenomena (as opposed to higher levels of\norganization, such as cells or anatomy).\n\nA final representational feature is intrinsicality, whereby what is\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d are explicitly or\nimplicitly distinguished in reductive explanations. Wimsatt (1980)\ndrew attention to the fact that every investigation must divide a\nsystem from its environment and that methodological reductionism\nfavors attributions of causal responsibility to internal parts of a\nsystem rather than those deemed external (see also Wilson 2004). In\nthe protein folding case, it appears that the failure of temporally\nindexed explanatory reduction involves the causal powers of something\nextrinsic to (an instance of) the process under scrutiny\n(i.e., the folding of a single amino acid chain). The presumption of\natemporal, compositional relationships has encouraged a neglect of\nthis distinction because nested part-whole relations are predicated on\na prior individuation of a system from its environment (H\u00fcttemann\nand Love 2011). Kaiser\u2019s (2015) idea that a reductive\nexplanation must (among other things) represent each lower-level part\nof the explanation \u201cin isolation\u201d from other parts is one\nexplicit attempt to engage representational questions related to\nintrinsicality\n (Section 3.2).\n Overall, this line of thought relates to the context-dependency\nobjection\n (Section 4.1),\n but emphasizes the importance of functional dependency relations\nuncovered by attending to temporality in addition to structural\norganization.\n\nRecognizing temporal aspects of reductive explanations found in\nbiology alongside other representational issues like intrinsicality,\nboth of which are not captured by a focus on mereology alone,\nstrengthens the argument in favor of talking about different\nkinds of reductionism rather a unified account of reduction\nor overarching dichotomies of \u201creductionism\u201d versus\n\u201canti-reductionism\u201d (or \u201cholism\u201d). Once we\nincorporate distinctions about different types of reduction\n(ontological, epistemic, and methodological), the different\ninterpretations of these types (e.g., theoretical versus explanatory\nepistemic reductions), the different representational features\ninvolved (spatial, temporal, etc.), and the distinct biological topics\nto which philosophers have applied them (e.g., development or\nfunctional anatomy), then any single conception of reduction appears\ninadequate to do justice to the diversity of phenomena and reasoning\npractices in the life sciences. The multiplicity and heterogeneity of\nbiological subdisciplines only reinforce this argument and suggest to\nsome that we should move beyond reductionism entirely.\n5. \u201cAlternatives\u201d to Reductionism: Moving Beyond Dichotomies\n\nMuch of the past discussion about reduction presupposes a unitary view\nof the scientific enterprise that involves a close relation between\nnatural kinds, laws, counterfactual dependence, explanation, and\nconfirmation (Godfrey-Smith 2008). One of the ubiquitous features of\nmodern biology that is prima facie incompatible with many\nmethodological and epistemological reductionist theses is the\nproliferation and flourishing of diverse biological subdisciplines,\nmolecular and otherwise. Despite the purported \u201chegemony of\nmolecular biology\u201d (Kitcher 1999a), biological subdisciplines\nfocused on higher levels of organization have not disappeared:\n\u201cSpecial sciences: still autonomous after all these years\u201d\n(Fodor 1997). For some time this feature of biological research, along\nwith many of the problems associated with theoretical reduction\n(especially its inapplicability to scientific practice, but also the\ndifficulties in identifying clear-cut and distinct\n\u201clevels\u201d to relate reductively; Brooks 2014, 2021, Brooks\net al. 2021, McGill and Potochnik 2012, Potochnik 2021), has prompted\nphilosophers to reject \u201creduction\u201d as the appropriate (or\nonly) relation among concepts and explanations from different\n domains.[15]\n Instead, relations of coordination driven by a commitment to\nunifying, integrating, or synthesizing aspects of scientific knowledge\nhave been offered (Bechtel and Hamilton 2007, Brigandt 2013b, Love\n2017, Potochnik 2011).\n\nLindley Darden and Nancy Maull were at the forefront of this\ndiscussion with the concept of an\n inter-field theory\n (Darden and Maull 1977, Maull 1977). For example, the advent of the\nchromosome theory of inheritance in the 1910s bridged the previously\nunrelated fields of Mendelian genetics (which studied phenotypic\npatterns of inheritance across generations) and cytology (which dealt\nwith the material contents of cells). This interfield theory effected\na kind of unification, but Mendelian genetics and cytology were not\nreduced to each other, nor did the interfield theory reduce both\nfields. More recent work has articulated interfield relations without\nrelying on the notion of a theory (Ankeny and Leonelli 2016, Bechtel\n1986, Burian 1993, Grantham 2004a, 2004b, Leonelli 2013, Mitchell\n2002). This parallels the trend in models of explanatory reduction of\nmoving away from theories as the only epistemic units of interest\n (Section 3.2),\n but the emphasis is on such relations as coordination, integration,\nsynthesis, or reciprocal interaction (Bechtel 2013, Green 2013,\nHochstein 2016, Love 2017, Nathan 2017, Plutynski 2013). A rationale\nfor these complex relations emerges from the demand for\nmultidisciplinary research (O\u2019Rourke et al. 2016); the\nexplanatory task involves coordinating diverse epistemic resources\n(Ankeny and Leonelli 2016), which amounts to an implicit rejection of\nthe \u201cfundamentality\u201d of one particular discipline\nproducing the most empirically adequate explanations.\n\nIn this context, Alan Love (2008a, 2014) uses the notion of a problem\nagenda to argue that some scientific problems not only motivate\ninterdisciplinary research but also provide structure for the\nrequisite intellectual coordination (see also Brigandt 2010, 2012,\nBrigandt and Love 2012, Villegas et al. 2023). Problem agendas consist\nof numerous component questions that stand in systematic relations and\nare tied to associated standards of explanatory adequacy. These\nstandards imply what epistemic resources and different disciplines are\nneeded to address the problem. The relations among component questions\nof the problem agenda (i.e., its internal structure) foreshadow how\nvarious contributions can be coordinated to generate an adequate\nexplanatory framework. Building on this perspective, Ingo Brigandt\n(2010) suggests that there is no single, linear hierarchy among\nscientific fields (e.g., Oppenheim and Putnam 1958), but that the\nrelationships among theories and disciplinary approaches are\ndetermined by and vary with the scientific problem being addressed.\nThese philosophical accounts align with general research on\ninterdisciplinarity, which has identified the presence and\narticulation of a complex question as a prerequisite (Repko 2008,\nSzostak 2002, 2009). Thus, instead of unification being a regulative\nideal with biologists seeking as much unity as possible in their\nexplanations of the complex natural world (e.g., Kitcher 1999b), an\nerotetic perspective suggests that particular problems determine the\nneed for and degree of any integration (Brigandt 2010). William\nBechtel\u2019s (1993, 2006) studies of cell biology document how the\nformation of new subdisciplines generates both integration among\napproaches and some disintegration due to new specializations.\nBechtel\u2019s attention to the institutional underpinnings of\nbiology also meshes with sociological analyses of disciplinary\norganization (Gerson 1998, 2013).\n\nRecently, accounts of explanation revolving around\n \u201cmechanisms\u201d\n have been widely discussed (e.g., Baetu 2015, Bechtel 2006, 2008,\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2005, Craver 2006, 2007, Darden 2006, Glennan\n1996, 2017, Machamer et al. 2000). Many philosophers view experimental\nbiology as fundamentally concerned with the discovery of mechanisms\n(Craver and Darden 2013, Darden and Craver 2002, Tabery 2004), where\nmechanisms are understood as akin (though not equivalent) to machines\nwith interconnected, organized parts operating to produce regular or\nexpected outcomes. Conceiving of biological explanation in terms of\nmechanisms provides a philosophical framework that closely tracks\nbiological practice and does not rely on the notion of a theory.\nBesides providing new models for explanatory reduction\n (Section 3.2),\n mechanisms also have been used to demonstrate integration among\ndifferent fields. Darden (2005) argues that both reduction and\nreplacement fail to capture the relations between classical and\n molecular genetics.\n Both fields deal with different mechanisms that occur at different\nperiods of the cell cycle and involve different working entities:\nclassical genetics focuses on meiosis and involves chromosomal\nbehavior; molecular genetics focuses on gene expression and involves\nvarious molecular entities such as nucleotide sequences. Relations\nbetween the two fields are manifested as differential attention to\ndistinct aspects of a larger, temporally extended mechanism.\n\nThe mechanisms framework has proved particularly fruitful in capturing\nexplanations that appeal to entities at several levels of organization\n(Darden 2016, Tabery 2014). An instructive example is Carl\nCraver\u2019s (2005, 2007) discussion of multilevel and multifield\nexplanation in the context of neuroscientific studies of learning.\nWhile the cellular-molecular process of long-term potentiation is\ncritical for memory formation, it is not merely a molecular\ncounterpart of memory. Long-term potentiation is a lower-level\ncomponent of an overall, multilevel mechanism. Reductionist accounts\nhave neglected the phenomenon of disciplinary integration at the same\nlevel of structural organization and invested too heavily in finished\nreductive explanations, ignoring the dynamic changes in research\nstrategy that precede them (Craver 2005). In addition to searching for\nmolecular correlates of higher-level phenomena\n(\u201cdownward-looking\u201d episodes), there also have been\nattempts to understand the role of molecular mechanisms in complex\nhigher-level phenomena (\u201cupward-looking\u201d periods of\nresearch). Sometimes progress has been achieved independently of or by\nabandoning reduction as an explanatory goal. This need to change\nstrategies depending on the research context is ubiquitous in\nmechanistic research (Bechtel 2010), which serves as another reminder\nfor philosophers to attend to actual scientific practice. Even though\na mechanism is temporally extended, philosophical analyses of\nmechanisms may not capture all aspects of temporality (see\n Section 4.3).\n While discussions have focused on the representation of time relative\nto a mechanism (e.g., Bechtel 2006, Machamer et al. 2000), not all\naspects of the dynamics of biological systems are well represented as\nmechanisms involving entities and activities. Some might be better\nmodeled using equations (Bechtel 2012, Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010,\n2011, Brigandt 2015, Weber 2008), and in other cases time might be\nrepresented independently of the mechanisms being\n investigated.[16]\n\nComplexity also has been a source for articulating non-reductionist\nepistemological accounts of biological reasoning (Wimsatt 1974, Hooker\n2011). Sandra Mitchell (2003, 2009) has argued that different forms of\nbiological complexity block standard reductionist perspectives.\nMultiple (idealized) causal models must be integrated from different\ndisciplinary approaches to adequately represent this complexity,\nincluding our uncertainty in predicting its behavior, which has\nimplications for any social policy derived from these models (see also\nMitchell 2008, 2020, Mitchell and Gronenborn 2017). She specifically\ndraws attention to the phenomenon of self-organization, which refers\nto how system behaviors or patterns emerge from non-specific\ninteractions among lower-level components (Camazine et al. 2001,\nKauffman 1993), such as the collective behavior of social insects.\n(Self-organizing phenomena are also relevant to reductionism in\nphysical science; see, e.g., Goldenfeld and Kadanoff 1999, Whitesides\nand Ismagilov 1999.) Although decomposing a system into parts is\nimportant for claims about self-organization, there is no localization\nof causal responsibility to individual components (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993, ch. 9). Instead, the system behavior is a function of\ngeneric patterns of component interaction, which foregrounds how\ncomplexity emerges from dynamics rather than constitution (see\n Section 4.3).\n For example, gene networks and human social networks may exhibit\nisomorphic patterns of self-organization due to their interactive\nstructure, which is unrelated to whether genes or humans are the\ncomponents. Thus, self-organizing phenomena occupy an odd place in the\nreductionism discussion because even though components are used to\nexplain the behavior of the system, it is the nature of their\ninteractions (not their specific characteristics) that generate\npatterns of behavior. These patterns are often referred to as\n emergent properties\n of the system (see also Bishop et al. 2022, Grantham 2007, Mitchell\n2012).\n\nThe philosophical import of biological complexity is underscored by\nrecent trends in systems biology (Boogerd et al. 2007, Green 2015,\n2017, Green et al. 2015, Mazzocchi 2012, Noble 2006, O\u2019Malley\nand Soyer 2012). In addition to the mathematical modeling of\nsystem-wide behavior, systems biology has a wealth of data about\nvarious molecular components of cells stemming from functional\ngenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods.\nDownward looking strategies in systems biology attempt to analyze\nsystemic dynamics into different components, whereas upward looking\nstrategies aim to synthesize how the quantitative interactions among\nindividual molecules result in higher-level behavior (Green et al.\n2018, Krohs and Callebaut 2007). Despite the focus on molecular\ncomponents and their interactions, non-reductionist themes tied to\ncomplexity are motivated by non-linear interactions and feedback loops\nthat generate emergent behaviors, distributed control, and system\nrobustness (Brigandt 2015, Bruggeman et al. 2002, Westerhoff and Kell\n2007).\n\nAnother distinct strand of discussion about reductionism is found in\ncritical analyses of methodology and explanation from the perspective\nof\n feminist philosophy of science\n and studies of the\n social aspects of science\n (e.g., Fehr 2004, Longino 1990, 1996).\n Feminist philosophy of biology\n has related reductionism and pluralism to other philosophical,\nscientific, and social issues. One core idea in these discussions is\nthat forms of reductionism are involved in mutually reinforcing\nfeedback loops with other factors, such as socioeconomic status or\nexpectations about gender (Keller and Longino 1996, Levins and\nLewontin 1985). Thus, reductionism, whether ontological, epistemic, or\nmethodological, can be understood as the manifestation of more diverse\ncommitments (e.g., political ideology) than much of the philosophy of\nbiology literature on reductionism would suggest\u2014the history of\nbiology points in this direction as well (see, e.g., Allchin 2008).\nThis line of criticism also suggests that the interrelations between\nreductionism in biology and the social sciences should be treated more\nexplicitly. Elisabeth Lloyd (2002) has argued that medical research\nshould not be restricted simply to molecular biological investigation\nbecause higher levels of social organization that are culturally\nsanctioned have unrecognized causal effects on health. As the social\nsciences and medicine attempt to apply different life science\nreasoning strategies, similar philosophical issues predictably\ntransfer, but with the potential for more socially damaging\nconsequences (see, e.g., Richardson 2013, 2021).\n\nA shared feature of many alternatives to reductionism is an emphasis\non pluralist dimensions of epistemology in biology that situate\nmethodological or explanatory reduction as only one among many\ncomponents (Dupr\u00e9 1993, Kellert et al. 2006, Longino 2000,\n2002, 2013, Mitchell 2003, Muszynski and Malaterre 2021,\nO\u2019Malley 2013). In different ways, these positions stress how\nthe scientific investigation of biological phenomena demands diverse\nepistemic tools without a requirement to tie it all together into\nfundamental physics, macromolecular chemistry, or even\n molecular biology.\n Thus, ontological reduction becomes more or less unhinged from\nepistemological reduction because there is no need to demonstrate how\neach and every domain of scientific inquiry is anchored in physical\nstuff. Scientists are epistemologically profligate, even if they are\nlargely metaphysically frugal (see Dupr\u00e9 1993 and van Fraassen\n2002 for differing perspectives on science and metaphysics). The\nplurality of biological research motivates a philosophical\n pluralism\n about biology, both in terms of the many meanings available for\ndifferent methodological and epistemological types of reduction, and\nthe need to have multiple dimensions of reductionism in order to\nsecure empirical adequacy with respect to modeling biological\nphenomena (Grantham 1999, Kellert et al. 2006, Looren de Jong 2006,\nMorange 2006, Sullivan 2009, van der Steen 1999, Wylie 1999).\n\nIt is clear that these different kinds of \u201calternatives\u201d\nto reductionism successfully capture a number of features left\nuntreated or ignored by theory reduction. However, it is an open\nquestion whether they supplant discussions of reduction or bear some\ncomplex relation to them (Craver 2005). Reasons in favor of the latter\nposition include the continued use of \u201creductionist\u201d\nlanguage (for and against) in biological research, as well as the fact\nthat a near universal reason for rejecting reduction and choosing an\nalternative is the problematic nature of theory reduction,\nwhich only represents a small space of the philosophical\npossibilities. One interpretation of some alternatives to reduction is\nthat they are responding to the complexity of reduction that has\nbecome more apparent over the past two decades (e.g., seeing\nexplanations as inherently interlevel), and the fact that\nbiologists\u2019 use of the term \u201creductionism\u201d refers to\ndifferent specific commitments in different cases and research\ncontexts. Thus, for example, mechanisms approaches are another way to\ntreat the heterogeneity of explanation (including reductive and\nnon-reductive aspects), which was largely ignored in the literature on\ntheory reduction, which assumed that a few select examples from\nbiological research were representative. This heterogeneity is a\npervasive feature of the history of biology; philosophical\nalternatives to reduction are responding in part to long-standing\ncontroversies among life science investigators about the legitimacy of\nreductionist research strategies and modes of explanation (see\n Section 2).\n The compatibility or conflict among these various alternatives and\ndifferent accounts of explanation in biology is still being probed\n(e.g., Bechtel 2006, 40\u201344), but the traditional philosophical\nproject of articulating a single notion of reduction to capture most\nessential aspects of theory structure and explanation across biology\nis unlikely to succeed.\n6. Future Prospects\n\nArguably, discussions of reductionism in biology are becoming more\nrather than less philosophically interesting. This is a consequence of\nrecognizing the diverse conceptual landscape carved out over past\ndecades, one that is much larger than that conceived of when only\nNagelian theory reduction was in view. Biological science is now more\nspecialized than ever, but disciplinary proliferation brings with it\nissues relevant to any analysis of reduction: using the same terms\ndifferently, disparate methodologies, distinct explanatory norms, and\ndivergent interests in \u201clevels\u201d of biological organization\n(Brooks 2021, Potochnik 2021). It also includes an acknowledgment that\ncertain enduring biological topics like development still engender\ndifficult questions about reductionism and new fields of inquiry\nreinvigorate these discussions (e.g., synthetic biology\u2019s appeal\nto molecular components as Lego-like building blocks in the\n Registry of Standard Biological Parts).\n Philosophers need to recognize that a criterion of adequacy on\naccounts of reductionism in biology involves interpreting why\nscientists make pronouncements about the failure of reductionism in\ndifferent areas of life science (see, e.g., De Backer et al.\n 2010).[17]\n\nThere also is increasing contact between neuroscience and\npsychologically oriented investigations (Barwich 2020, Bechtel 2008,\nBoogerd et al. 2002, Craver 2007, Sullivan 2016, 2017, Tabb 2019). A\npotential prospect related to the contact between molecular\nneurobiology and psychology is the injection of epistemic\nconsiderations into philosophy of mind discussions (Godfrey-Smith\n2008). More attention to issues of representation, decomposition, and\ntemporality could alter the nature of these debates. At the same time,\na more explicit evaluation of metaphysical components\nimported from philosophy of mind into philosophy of biology is\nwarranted. Discussions of the status of downward causation and\nrealization in biological systems are relevant for a better\nunderstanding of the intersection between epistemological and\nmetaphysical components of reduction (Craver and Bechtel 2007, Green\n2021, Love 2012, Robinson 2005, Wilson and Craver 2007, Woodward\n2021). For example, an interest in the context sensitivity of\nrealization in philosophy of mind (Wilson 2004, ch. 6) invokes issues\npertaining to the context objection, individuation, temporality\n(especially causation versus constitution), and intrinsicality. These\nanalyses can then be imported into biological contexts to argue for or\nagainst particular aspects of reductionism (see, e.g., Wilson\n2005).\n\nMore work is needed in how to relate different kinds of hierarchies to\nquestions of reductionism. Biological hierarchies are diverse (Grene\n1987, Korn 2002, 2005) and subject to evolutionary change (Baedke\n2021, DiFrisco, 2021, T\u00ebmkin 2021), and some areas of biological\nresearch, such as paleontology and systematics (Valentine and May\n1996; see also Grantham 1999, 2004a, 2004b, 2007), have been ignored\nwhen reductionism comes into view. Paying attention to temporality\nencourages the exploration of functional or control hierarchies in\nmore detail (Love 2021, Salthe 1985, 1993, Wimsatt 2002). The\nlimitations of representing biological systems in terms of hierarchies\nshould be explored in more depth as well (Bechtel 2022, Brooks 2014,\nO\u2019Malley et al. 2014, Potochnik 2021, Potochnik and McGill\n2012).\n\nAll of these possibilities suggest more scrutiny of disciplinary\nheterogeneity in biological investigation relevant to reductionism.\nAlthough ecology has received some treatment (Dupr\u00e9 1993, ch.\n5, Mikkelson 2004), issues of decomposition and representation have\nnot yet received wide attention. Other topics connected to explanatory\nreduction and mechanisms in experimental research are cancer\n(Bertolaso 2013, 2016, Bizzarri et al. 2008, Green 2021, Moss 2002,\nPlutynski 2013, Soto and Sonnenschein 2005, 2006) and stem cells\n(Fagan 2013, Laplane 2016, Laplane and Solary 2019). Because of the\ndiversity of explanations found in these different disciplines, the\nnature of scientific explanation returns with a vengeance (Schaffner\n2006). Although only a few reductionists demand that explanation be\nstrictly nomological (Rosenberg 2006, Weber 2005), the subtle\ninterplay between explanation and reduction must be treated when\nranging over diverse biological subdisciplines. Additionally, as more\nattention is given to the diversity of investigative reasoning (or\n\u201cscientific practice\u201d) in and among these disciplinary\ncontexts, the interplay between different aspects of methodological\nand epistemic reduction will become more salient. To achieve an\nunderstanding of the intricacy and diversity of scientific practice,\nit has become more common for philosophers of science to interact or\ncollaborate with scientists from various fields (\u201cengaged\nphilosophy of science\u201d), where some of the engagement with\npracticing scientists and stakeholders affected by science and\ntechnology also aims at influencing the methodological approaches\nadopted in such research (Brister and Frodeman 2020, Kaiser and\nMeunier 2014, Plaisance and Elliott 2021, Tuana 2010, 2013).\n\nA final prospect concerns whether discussions of reduction in\ndifferent sciences will interact fruitfully. Although questions about\nreduction in philosophy of physics have largely diverged from those in\nphilosophy of biology, some connections have been drawn (Batterman\n2021, Green and Batterman 2017). For example, Sarkar has approached\nquantum mechanics using his account of reductionism that was forged in\na biological context (Jaeger and Sarkar 2003). A potential\nintersection between these discussions arises around the relations\nbetween parts and wholes or temporality, which have come under\nscrutiny from philosophers focused on the physical sciences\n(H\u00fcttemann 2004, Love and H\u00fcttemann 2011, Rueger 2000,\nRueger and McGivern 2010). Another area worthy of more attention is\nreductive explanation in chemistry, which has been ignored in large\npart by philosophers of biology (see, e.g., Bishop 2010, LePoidevin\n2005, Ramsey 1997, Scerri 1994, 2000).\n\nIn all these cases it seems clear that debates about reductionism in\nbiology have not reached a denouement but rather portend vigorous\nphilosophical discussion as the heterogeneity of issues related to its\nontological, epistemological, and methodological types are brought to\nbear on perennial biological topics. The task of philosophers focused\non reductionism in biology will be to analyze these promiscuities of\nreasoning and seek to develop different accounts of reduction that\ncapture what scientists actually do and contribute to more general\nperspectives on biological knowledge and scientific inquiry.\n",
