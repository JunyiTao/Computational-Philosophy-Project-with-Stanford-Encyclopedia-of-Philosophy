    "main_text": "Justifications for multiculturalism || Freedom from domination\n2.3 Freedom from domination\n\nAnother set of arguments for multiculturalism rests on the value of freedom. Some theorists such as Phillip Pettit (1997) and Quentin Skinner (1998) have developed the idea of freedom from domination by drawing on the civic republican tradition. Building on this line of argument to argue for recognition, Frank Lovett (2009) maintains that domination presents a serious obstacle to human flourishing. In contrast to the conception of freedom as non-interference dominant in liberal theory, freedom as non-domination, drawn from the civic republic tradition, focuses on a person\u2019s \u201ccapacity to interfere, on an arbitrary basis, in certain choices that the other is in a position to make\u201d (Pettit 1997, 52). On this view of freedom, we can be unfree even when we are not experiencing any interference as in the case of a slave of a\nbenevolent master. We are subject to domination to the extent that we are dependent on another person or group who can arbitrarily exercise power over us (Pettit 1997, ch. 2).\n\nFrank Lovett has explored the implications of the value of freedom\nfrom domination for questions of multicultural accommodation (2010).\nHe begins from the premise that freedom from domination is an\nimportant human good and that we have a prima facie obligation to\nreduce domination. He argues that the state should not accommodate\nsocial practices that directly involve domination. Indeed, if freedom\nfrom domination is a priority, then one should \u201caim to bring\nsuch practices to an end as quickly as possible, despite any\nsubjective value they happen to have for their participants\u201d\n(2010, 256). As for practices that do not involve subjecting\nindividuals to domination, accommodation is permissible but not\nnecessarily required. Accommodation is only required if accommodation\nwould advance the goal of reducing domination. He discusses one\nstylized example based on a familiar real-world case: the practice\namong Muslim women and girls of wearing headscarves. Suppose, Lovett\nsuggests, a detailed study of a particular Muslim community in a\nliberal democratic society is undertaken and it reveals that women\u2019s\neducational and employment opportunities are discouraged, generating\n\u201csevere patriarchal domination,\u201d but the study also shows\nthat the practice of wearing headscarves does not (2010, 258). Lovett\nargues that the practice of wearing headscarves should be accommodated\nbecause failure to do so might strengthen the community\u2019s commitment\nto other shared practices that reinforce patriarchal domination.\n\n\nA key empirical assumption here is that combating patriarchal\npractices within minority communities would be easier if the burdens\non more benign practices, such as wearing headscarves, are\nlessened. Cecile Laborde\u2019s analysis of the headscarf controversy in\nFrance provides support for this assumption: the effect of preventing\nMuslim girls from wearing headscarves is to encourage their parents to\nwithdraw their daughters from civic education and send them to\nreligious schools where they would not be exposed to the diversity of\nworld views found in public schools. Formal restrictions on Muslim\nreligious expression in the public sphere may make, in Laborde\u2019s\nwords, \u201cmembers of dominated groups close ranks around the\ndenigrated practice, precipitating a defensive retreat into\nconservative cultural forms and identities\u201d (2008, 164).\n\nAnother situation in which accommodation is warranted on Lovett\u2019s\naccount is when individuals\u2019 subjective attachment to particular\npractices makes them vulnerable to exploitation. He discusses the case\nof Mexican immigrant laborers with limited English language skills and\nlimited knowledge of American laws and policies. Lovett argues that\nextending \u201cspecial public measures,\u201d such as exceptions to\ngeneral rules and regulations and public legal assistance, is required\ninsofar as such measures would reduce the domination of these workers\n(2010, 260). In contrast to the communitarian or liberal egalitarian\narguments considered above, the basis for the special accommodations\nis not a desire to protect intrinsically valuable cultures or\nconsiderations of fairness or equality but the desire to reduce\ndomination.\n\nMira Bachvarova has also argued for the merits of a\nnon-domination-based multiculturalism as compared to liberal\negalitarian approaches. Because of its focus on the arbitrary use of\npower and the broader structural inequalities within which groups\ninteract, a non-domination approach may be more sensitive to power\ndynamics in both inter-group and intra-group relations. Also, in\ncontrast to approaches developed out of egalitarian theories of\ndistributive justice that focus on distributing different types of\nrights, a non-domination approach focuses on the \u201cmoral quality\nof the relationship between the central actors\u201d and insists on\ncontinuity of treatment between and within groups (2014, 671).\n",
