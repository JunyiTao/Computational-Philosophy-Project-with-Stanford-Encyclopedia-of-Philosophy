    "main_text": "The External and the Internal Elixirs || Waidan or External Alchemy\n10.1 Waidan or External Alchemy\n\nIn the Taiqing (Great Clarity) tradition of Waidan, which\ndeveloped from the 3rd century CE, the alchemical practice\nis framed as a complex ritual sequence (Pregadio 2006). The initial\nstage is the ceremony of transmission, followed by a period of\nretirement and purifications. Then, having protected the ritual space\nby means of talismans (fu), the alchemist builds the\nlaboratory, or \u201cchamber of the elixirs\u201d (danshi).\nAt a time deemed to be suitable according to traditional hemerology,\nthe alchemist performs a ceremony for kindling the\nfire\u2014including a request of assistance addressed to Laojun (Lord\nLao) and other deities\u2014and only then does he devote himself to\nthe compounding. The process is concluded by the consecration and the\ningestion of the elixir. It is this entire sequence, and not only the\nwork at the furnace, that constitutes the alchemical practice.\n\nThe main tool, from both a ritual and a technical point of view, is\nthe crucible. To reproduce the state of the cosmos at its inception\n(hundun; see \u00a74.3), the vessel\nshould be hermetically sealed so that the vital \u201cbreath\u201d\n(qi) is not dispersed. Under these conditions, the elixir\ningredients \u201crevert\u201d (huan) to their original\nstate. This refined matter is equated with the Essence (jing)\nthat is hidden within the Dao and gives birth to the world\n(\u201cVague and indistinct! Within it there is something. Dim and\nobscure! Within it there is an essence\u201d; Daode jing,\nsec. 21). The elixir therefore is a tangible sign of the seed that\ngenerates the cosmos.\n\nIngesting an elixir is said to confer, in the first place,\ntranscendence, immortality, and admission into the ranks of the\ncelestial bureaucracy. One also gains the ability of summoning\nbenevolent gods and obtains protection from demons, spirits, and\nseveral other disturbances, including weapons, wild animals, and even\nthieves. Remarkably, in order to provide these benefits, the elixir\ndoes not need to be ingested: it may simply be kept in one\u2019s\nhand or carried at the belt as a powerful apotropaic talisman.\n",
