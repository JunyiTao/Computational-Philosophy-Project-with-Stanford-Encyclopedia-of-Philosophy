    "main_text": "Christian Thomasius || Life and Works\n1.1 Life and Works\n\nChristian Thomasius was born on 1 January 1655 in Leipzig. He was the\nson of Jakob Thomasius (1622\u201384), a well-known jurist and\nphilosopher at the University of Leipzig who counted Leibniz among his\nstudents. Christian (hereafter simply \u2018Thomasius\u2019)\nmatriculated in the philosophy faculty at Leipzig in 1669, and was\npromoted to Magister artium in 1672. As a result of his\nfather\u2019s lectures, particularly on Hugo Grotius\u2019 De\njure belli ac pacis, and his interest in Samuel Pufendorf\u2019s\nDe jure naturae et gentium, Thomasius took up the study of\nlaw in Frankfurt an der Oder in 1675 and was awarded a doctorate in\n1679. After a brief journey to Holland, Thomasius returned to Leipzig\nwhere he worked (unhappily) as a lawyer while also holding private\nlectures on natural jurisprudence. Thomasius attests to the\nfundamental reorientation of his thinking effected by his reading of\nPufendorf, and the Apologia pro se et suo libro (1674) in\nparticular, which he credits for convincing him of the independence of\nnatural law from theology as well as of the need to question authority\nand resist religious intolerance (Thomasius 1688a, \u201cDiss.\nProem.\u201d \u00a7\u00a75\u201310; Hochstrasser 2000:\n113\u2013121). This new anti-authoritarian cast of mind is clearly\nevident in a dissertation on bigamy of 1685, in which Thomasius\ndefends the practice as consistent with natural law, and which\nunsurprisingly led to a confrontation with a professor in the theology\nfaculty at Leipzig. Thomasius\u2019 pioneering decision to hold\nlectures in German, announced (in German) in 1687, likewise provoked\ncontroversy, as did his publication beginning in 1688 of a monthly\njournal (the first periodical published in German), entitled the\nMonatsgespr\u00e4che, in which Thomasius commented,\nfrequently satirically, on the local intellectual scene.\nThomasius\u2019 lectures and publications increasingly generated\nconflict with the theological faculty in Leipzig, which upheld a\nrather strict form of Lutheran orthodoxy, and while his connections\nwith the Saxon court stood him in good stead for a time, his defence\nof an inter-faith marriage involving a (Lutheran) Saxon count and a\n(Calvinist) Brandenburg princess cost him his protection, and in March\n1690 he was prohibited from publishing and holding lectures (private\nand academic) in Electoral Saxony.\n\nThomasius sought refuge in Berlin, in the neighbouring state of\nBrandenburg which was led by the Calvinist Elector Friedrich III\n(later king Friedrich I) and had a tradition of toleration. Partly\nthrough the support of Pufendorf himself, Thomasius was given an\nappointment as councillor to the court, and was allowed to lecture at\nthe Ritterakademie in Halle an der Saale, which in 1694 would become\nthe Friedrichs-Universit\u00e4t, with Thomasius among the founding\nfaculty (in law). Thomasius was soon joined by the Pietist\norientalist, theologian and educational reformer, August Hermann\nFrancke, who had likewise run afoul of the religious authorities in\nLeipzig. Thomasius himself had been sympathetic with the\nanti-scholastic and anti-authoritarian bent of the Pietists (see\n \u00a73.2\n below), and had publicly defended Francke at one point in Leipzig;\nhowever, a public break occurred when Thomasius published a criticism,\nin 1699, of the pedagogy Francke had adopted in his famous educational\ninstitutions in Halle. Thomasius continued to stir controversy with\nhis lectures and publications, which frequently over-reached the\npurview of the juristic faculty (such as his critical discussion of\nwitchcraft trials\u2014Beck 1969: 253\u2013254), and breached\ndecorum by personally attacking his theological colleagues, all of\nwhich led to a reprimand from the Brandenburg court in 1702 and an\norder to adhere to the boundaries between faculties. Thomasius\u2019\ndissertation De concubinatu of 1713, in which he contended\nthat the use of concubines does not violate the marriage contract\ngiven that the purpose of marriage is solely procreation, also\ngenerated heated discussion. While Thomasius and Francke reconciled in\n1714, Thomasius did not play a significant role in the later\ncontroversy between Wolff and the Pietists. He died in Halle on 23\nSeptember 1728.\n\nThomasius\u2019 works cover a wide range of topics. In addition to\nthe topical essays and dissertations already mentioned, Thomasius\npublished major texts on natural law, including the Institutiones\njurisprudentiae divinae (Institutions of Divine\nJurisprudence) of 1688 and the Fundamentum iuris naturae et\ngentium (Foundations of the Law of Nature and Nations)\nof 1705 (for discussion of Thomasius\u2019 contributions to natural\nlaw theory, which will not be taken up here, see especially\nHochstrasser 2000: ch. 4; K\u00fchnel 2001; and Lutterbeck 2002).\nThomasius also published on topics in theoretical and practical\nphilosophy, especially during his time in Halle. Thomasius wrote a\nnumber of texts on logic, such as the Introductio ad philosophiam\nauliam (Introduction to Court Philosophy) of 1688, as\nwell as the Einleitung zur Vernunfft-Lehre (Introduction\nto the Doctrine of Reason) and the Aus\u00fcbung der\nVernunfft-Lehre (Application of the Doctrine of Reason)\nboth of 1691. These were followed by a parallel exhibition of his\nmoral philosophy in the Einleitung zur Sitten-Lehre\n(Introduction to the Doctrine of Morals) of 1692 and the\nAus\u00fcbung der Sitten-Lehre (Application of the\nDoctrine of Morals) of 1696, as well as an influential excursion\ninto metaphysics in the Versuch von Wesen des Geistes\n(Essay on the Essence of Spirit) in 1699 (second edition\n1709).\n",
