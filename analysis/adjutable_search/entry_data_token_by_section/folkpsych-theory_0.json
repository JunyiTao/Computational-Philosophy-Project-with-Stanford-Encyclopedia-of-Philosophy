Theory Theory\n\nA mainstream view in analytic philosophy is that folk psychology, or\nFP, is a theory and that FP abilities centrally involving theorizing\nin some sense or at some level. These ideas have deep roots in the\nanalytic tradition and have shaped much received thinking on the\ntopic. The general view is known as theory-theory, or TT, in\nphilosophical and psychological circles\u2014a name first introduced\nby Morton (1980) to highlight the fact that the thesis that \u201cFP\nis a theory\u201d is itself a theory, and not obviously a\ntrue one. Others, such as Rosenberg, maintain that FP\n\n\nis so simple and mind-numbingly obvious, it seems almost preposterous\nto call it a \u201ctheory\u201d. (2018: 36)\n\n\nMany of today\u2019s philosophers and psychologists maintain that FP\nabilities simply constitute, or are otherwise sponsored by, a Theory\nof Mind, or ToM (see Baron-Cohen, Lombardo, & Tager-Flusberg\n2013). This thesis is usually coupled with a familiar explanatory\nhypothesis about how FP understanding is achieved, namely, FP\nunderstanding is underwritten by capacities to mentalize or\n\u201cmindread\u201d. On the standard interpretation, mindreading\nminimally requires:\n\nRepresenting and attributing mental state attitudes (minimally\nbelief and desire, but possibly other mental states too);\nRepresenting and attributing the contents of such attitudes;\nAppreciating how such attitudes structurally interrelate.\n\n\nConditions 1\u20133 can be weakened in various ways, allowing for the\npossibility of mindreaders with less than fully-fledged folk\npsychological capacities. For example, it is possible to represent and\nattribute mental state concepts and contents other than only those of,\nsay, beliefs and desires, and still qualify as a mindreader.\n\nTT about FP is distinctive in assuming that when we understand minds\nin daily life we use the same sorts of tools that we use to understand\nother non-mental phenomena, specifically, we use the same sort of\ntools we use in the sciences\u2014namely, theories that aim to tell\nus about the unobservable, hidden causal structure of the world.\n\nToM is a particular kind of theory: it is assumed to have a\ndistinctive sort of content. A ToM operates with mental state concepts\nthat feature in theoretical postulates that comprise the core general\nprinciples of a theory of everyday psychology. The content of the ToM\nthat normally developing humans use is, for TTists, what enables most\nof us to navigate our everyday social world fluidly and with ease. TT\nholds that we succeed in understanding ourselves and others if we\nmanage to infer the mental states responsible for particular actions\ncorrectly by applying a ToM, thereby bringing the laws of everyday\npsychology to bear on particular cases. As such, TTists hold that, for\nmost of us, the heavy lifting in daily social cognition is done by our\nacquaintance with, and use of, laws of a folk ToM.\n\nAccording to TTists, engaging in FP involves the deployment of the\nrelevant mentalistic concepts by making use of a distinctive set of\nprinciples\u2014a network of laws or propositions about mentalistic\nattitudes and their relations to other states of mind. This system of\ninferences allegedly constitutes the core framework for making sense\nof and rationalizing actions in terms of reasons, even though it must\nbe supported by further auxiliary generalizations about what people\ntypically do in a range of circumstances.\n\nSeveral philosophical considerations conspire to make TT a compelling\nview of FP. In his seminal \u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of\nMind\u201d (1956), Wilfrid Sellars aired the idea that our\nunderstanding of mental states is, essentially, theoretical. In an\nengaging bit of philosophical anthropological fiction, he famously\nmused about how our Rylean ancestors, who were as yet behaviorists,\nmight have first fashioned an understanding of thoughts as inner\nepisodes. He invented a mythical Jones who modeled inner thoughts on\novert speech acts, imagining that the former could, just like the\nlatter, be cited in the explanation of action. Assuming that reasons\nare the inferred causes of action, it is but a short step to thinking\nthat explaining action using a schema that goes beyond what is merely\ngiven in another\u2019s outward responses is necessarily a kind of\ntheoretical activity.\n\nThis way of understanding is a natural partner for the idea that\ngenuinely intelligent engagements with aspects of the world are\nmediated by representations of one sort or another. It is a small step\nfrom accepting a representational theory of mind to assuming that our\nFP understanding of minds requires representing the representations of\nintelligent creatures\u2014thus taking a theoretical, or\nspectator\u2019s, stance towards them. Understanding and interacting\nwith other minds, according to this view, requires formulating\nhypotheses as to what exactly is \u201cgoing on in\u201d those minds\nsince those workings are not directly open to view.\n\nSome philosophers are attracted to TT because they maintain that the\nmeanings of FP mental state concepts show signs of being theoretical\nin character\u2014namely, that such meanings are fixed by their\nhaving appropriate links or relations to other concepts in a\nstructured theory. On this view, the meaning of mental states terms is\ndefined holistically by the special roles the entities such terms\ndenote play within a wider inferential network. Accordingly, the very\nmeaning of a mental concept is taken to be determined by the\ndistinctive role it plays within a network of principles. In this\nrespect, our familiar mentalistic vocabulary (viz. our talk of\nthoughts, feelings, and expectations) would be similar in important\nrespects to other theoretically embedded vocabularies (e.g., talk of\nelectrons, atoms, and gravity).\n\nIn a series of influential papers, David Lewis (1970, 1972) defended a\nparticular approach to the semantics of theoretical terms.\nHe applied that same approach to everyday\npsychological vocabulary (e.g., \u201cbelief\u201d and\n\u201cdesire\u201d), and thereby obtained a functionalist theory of\nmental states. Accordingly, when thinking about the semantics of\neveryday psychological vocabulary, Lewis treats the conjunction of\ncommonsense platitudes about mental states as a term-introducing\ntheory. It is possible to identify folk psychology with that\nconjunction. Alternatively, we could think of folk psychology as a\nsystematization of a set of platitudes. Either way, Lewis\u2019s\napproach lends credence to the idea that FP is structured in the same\nway as other kinds of theory.\n\nLewis also held that claims about the platitudes are empirical\nclaims\u2014they are claims about what is commonly believed about\nmental states. However, Lewis\u2019s intuitions about mental states\nwere likely influenced by his theoretical stance. Consequently, there\nis little reason to think that Lewis\u2019s own intuitions are a good\nguide to what people typically believe about the mind.\n\nLewis simply assumes that common sense is resolutely committed to the\nidea that mental states are characterized by causal role; as a result,\nhis functionalist conclusion drives his characterization of the\nplatitudes. No doubt Lewis has philosophical arguments for denying\nthat mental states are substances that possess their causal powers\nnon-essentially or substances that lack causal powers altogether. But\nthat is beside the present point. Lewis aimed to capture what the folk\nthink about mental states, not what the philosophical\nliterati think.\n\nA unifying idea that motivates all TT proposals is that the primary\njob or function of folk psychology is that of third-personal\nprediction and explanation. The standard TT assumption is that\nprediction and explanation are symmetrical: predicting how another\ncreature might act or, on the flip side, explaining why it acted,\nrequires representing its complex state of mind\u2014namely, the way\ncertain of its mental states relate to one another. Putting all of\nthis together can promote the appearance that FP is in the same\ngeneral line of business as scientific theories that are used to\nunderstand other phenomena.\n\nAn important question for proponents of TT is: What are FP\u2019s\nprecise ontological commitments? Putatively, FP theorizes about what\ngoes on inside our heads\u2014in the black box that lies between\nperceptual stimuli and behavioral responses. If so, FP posits inner\nentities that causally explain outward behavior. Taken at face value,\nFP would appear to be theoretically committed to the entities and\nproperties that it speaks of as being causally responsible for our\nactions. Those who understand FP as having these transparent\ncommitments assume that it is committed to explaining actions by\nappeal to causally efficacious contentful mental items, such as\nbeliefs and desires (see, e.g., Fodor 1987, see also Rosenberg 2018).\nTTists of a realist bent assume that FP is committed to an unqualified\nrealism about the entities and their properties that it quantifies\nover.\n\nSo construed, FP comes with built-in \u201cheavy-duty\u201d, as\nopposed to \u201clight-duty\u201d, ontological commitments\n(Langland-Hassan 2020). Light duty TTists actively eschew or are\notherwise agnostic about whether FP is committed to the existence of\nentities with the properties that are referred to in our everyday FP\nattributions. Several variants of TT, including instrumentalist and\nfictionalist variants, that assume our everyday sense-making practice\nhas only light-duty ontological commitments (Egan 1995; Graham &\nHorgan 1988; Schwitzgebel 2002, 2013; Demeter 2013).\n\nOne of the best known \u201clight duty\u201d versions of TT proposes\nthat FP should be understood as nothing more than an intentional\nstance or heuristic we employ for quick and dirty predictions of the\nbehavior of a wide variety of systems (Dennett 1985, 1987). FP\nascriptions are, on the intentional stance view, irredeemably\nindeterminate. As such, we have no grounds for taking FP attributions\nontologically seriously above and beyond the limited practical\nleverage they give us in enabling us to make such predictions and\nexplanations.\n\nDennett (1985, 1987) assumes that, in principle, an ideal physics\ntrades in non-probabilistic laws capable of yielding perfect\nforward-facing predictions and perfect backward-looking explanations.\nBy comparison, FP, though of great practical value, can never come\nclose to the predictive and explanatory successes of the hard\nsciences: hence we have no reason to take FP\u2019s posits as\nontologically seriously as we take those found in the hard sciences.\nThus, for Dennett, FP constructs can be treated as only capturing\nmildly real patterns: they are to be regarded as no more and no less\nreal than numbers, centers of gravity, or other\n\u201ccalculation-bound\u201d entities (Dennett 1991).\n\nTo adopt a light-duty TT view of FP\u2019s ontological commitments is\nto hold that, however useful FP is in everyday contexts, the crude\npredictions and explanations it sponsors are not the sort that\ncan seriously predict or explain the behavior of others. If we wish to\nget at the underlying mechanics and drivers of behavior\u2014its true\ncauses\u2014we must look to mature cognitive science, not FP.\n",
