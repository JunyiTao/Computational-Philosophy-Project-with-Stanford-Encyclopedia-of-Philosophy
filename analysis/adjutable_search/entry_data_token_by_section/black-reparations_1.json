    "main_text": "John Locke on Reparations\n2. John Locke on Reparations\n\n\nJohn Locke provided an early and very clear argument for the\nreparations owed a lawful conqueror, and many arguments for black\nreparations follow the outlines of his\nargument.[2] For\nLocke people have natural rights they get directly from Natural Law\nand rights they have acquired in accordance with Natural law. To\nrestrain violations of rights, he proposed punishment; punishment must\nbe administered \u201cwith so much Severity as will suffice to make\nit an ill bargain to the Offender, give him cause to repent, and\nterrifie others from doing the like.\u201d (Locke 1689: sec 8) And to\nrepair the damage that crime \u201ccommonly\u201d causes \u201csome\nperson or other,\u201d Locke proposed reparations. As he put it,\nreparation must give the \u201csatisfaction due to any private Man,\nfor the damage he has received\u201d (Locke 1689: sec 11). According\nto Locke, reparations were rights stemming from the right of\nself-preservation. But he insisted that the rights can be pressed only\nagainst the \u201cgoods or service of the Offender\u201d (Locke\n1689: sec 11). More precisely, while the person damaged can seek help\nfrom anyone, she, the victim, has a right to reparations only against\nthe one who wrongly caused her damage. But Locke does not say that she\nmust be the immediate victim of the \u201cOffender\u201d. His claim\nthat crime commonly damages \u201csome person or other\u201d\nsuggests that she may be anyone damaged as a result of the\noffender\u2019s violation of right. For example, she may be damaged\nbecause someone murdered her father and thus caused her to live in\nstraitened conditions. On Locke\u2019s account, she may be entitled\nto press her right to reparations against the murderer for the damage\nhe caused her to suffer. On the other hand, Locke\u2019s claim that\ncrime \u201ccommonly\u201d damages someone suggests that crime or\nviolations of rights do not always cause damage and\nconsequently do not always generate rights to reparations, though it\ndoes not suggest that such violations of right do not deserve to be\npunished. But even when the violation of right does not cause material\nlosses, it may cause damages to its victim\u2019s self-respect and\nmoral standing, and in such cases the satisfaction due to her may\ninclude an admission of wrong doing from the wrongdoer, a plea for her\nforgiveness, and an apology. If such admission, plea, and apology\nrequire that the wrongdoer repent, reparations may seem to require\nthat the wrongdoer be punished, given Locke\u2019s view that\nrepentance is among the objects of punishment (Locke 1689: sec 8). But\nLocke seems clear that the rights to reparations and the right to\npunish are different rights. On his view, we give up the right to\npunish to the state, but retain the rights to reparations.  He writes\nthat the \u201cMagistrate, \u2026 can often, where the publick good\ndemands not the execution of the Law, remit the punishment of\nCriminal Offences \u2026, but cannot yet remit the\nsatisfaction due to any private Man, for the damage he has\nreceived\u201d (Locke 1689: sec 11). Arguably, then, the apology the\nwrongdoer must give to his victim in order to give her the\nsatisfaction she has a right to does not require that he repent and\nperhaps therefore does not require that his apology be sincere. It is\nalso worth noting that although unjust enrichment from crime should\nnot be tolerated, it has little if anything to do with reparations.\nReparations focus on getting satisfaction for the injured victim of\ncrime and the criminal need not unjustly enrich himself as a result of\nthe crime to have wrongfully injured her. He owes her reparations even\nif he impoverished himself in the process of injuring her. Finally\ngiven Locke\u2019s separation of the right to punish from the rights\nof reparations, and his claim that the rights to reparations is about\nmaking satisfaction to the victim of wrongdoing, Locke would seem\ncommitted to holding that when an act of wrong doing is excused though\nit causes harm that the victim has a right to reparations although the\nmagistrate may well decide that the public good does not require that\nthe state exercise its right to punish the wrongdoer.\n",
