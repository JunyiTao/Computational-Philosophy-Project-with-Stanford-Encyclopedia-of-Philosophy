    "main_text": "Scholastic Concepts of Probability\n3. Scholastic Concepts of Probability\n\nIn some areas of medieval thought, probability-related terms were\nimportant for the regulation of decision-making and conduct. In these\ncontexts, the term \u201cprobable\u201d (probabilis) took\non a specific significance. Whether a merchant wanted to follow an\nopinion concerning the moral legitimacy of a contract or a lawyer\nformulated a presumption, it had to be probabilis to possess\nmoral or juridical weight. It is now necessary to discuss the most\nimportant medieval understandings of probabilis, grounding\nthem in ancient definitions or precedent.\n\nUntil the thirteenth century, the definitions of\n\u201cprobable\u201d by Cicero and Boethius very much shaped the\nmedieval understanding of probability:\n\n\nThat is probable which for the most part usually comes to pass, or\nwhich is a part of the ordinary beliefs of mankind, or which contains\nin itself some resemblance to these qualities, whether such\nresemblance be true or false. (Cicero, De inventione,\nI.29.46)\n\nSomething is readily believable (probabilis) if it seems true\nto everyone or to the most people or to the wise \u2013 and of the\nwise, either to all of them or most of them or to the most famous and\ndistinguished \u2013 or to an expert in his own field, for example,\nto a doctor in the field of medicine or to a pilot in the navigation\nof ships, or, finally, if it seems true to the person with whom one is\nhaving the conversation or who is judging it. (Boethius, De\ntopicis, 1180b28)\n\n\nFor Cicero, probability represents the usual course of events,\ncommonly held beliefs, or what resembles them. His characterization of\nprobability thus contains the roots of at least two different concepts\nof probability. Boethius repeats Aristotle\u2019s definition of an\nendoxon (see Section 3.1) as a readily believable proposition\nalmost verbatim and calls it probabilis. In this respect, he\nprepared the way for the reception of Aristotle\u2019s original\ndefinition; but note that Boethius addresses the role of experts more\nexplicitly than Aristotle, who in medieval translations summarily\nrefers to sapientes, the\n wise.[11]\n\nAristotle replaced Cicero and Boethius as supreme authority on\nprobability in the thirteenth century. This is also the time when\nmedieval probability discourse fully unfolded. For the period from\n(roughly) 1200 to 1500, it is possible to identify four different\nconcepts of probability: the endoxic, proto-frequentist, testimonial\nor juridical, and semantic. The number of concepts is, however, a\nmatter of interpretation since it is possible to split up the\njuridical category of probability\n further.[12]\n\nThe use of probability-related terms was almost certainly wider than\nthe concepts of probability listed above suggest. In philosophical and\ntheological debates, as well as in the regulation of action,\nprobabilis could be used as a predicate for the argumentative\nsupport which a proposition had (translatable as\n\u201cplausible\u201d or \u201crationally tenable\u201d). In the\nearly modern era, this aspect of medieval probability became\nexplicitly integrated into the definition of a probable opinion\n(Knebel 2000; Maryks 2008; Schuessler 2019; Tutino 2018). It was not,\nhowever, expressly addressed in medieval and, in particular,\nscholastic characterizations of probability. Here, the focus will be\non such characterizations in medieval sources.\n",
