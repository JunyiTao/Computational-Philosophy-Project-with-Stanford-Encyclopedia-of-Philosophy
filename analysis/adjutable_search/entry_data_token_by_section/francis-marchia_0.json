    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\n Francis of Marchia (a.k.a. de Appignano, de Pignano, de Esculo, de\nAscoli, Franciscus Rubeus, and the Doctor Succinctus) was\nborn ca. 1285\u20131290 in the village of Appignano del Tronto in the\nprovince of Ascoli Piceno, east of Rome and near the Adriatic (see especially Marchia 2008, xiii\u2013xvii). He became a Franciscan and rose in the order\u2019s educational hierarchy, probably studying theology at the\nUniversity of Paris around 1310, then teaching at a Franciscan\nstudium elsewhere, before returning to the Minorites\u2019 Paris\nstudium to lecture on the Sentences of Peter Lombard\nas bachelor of theology, a common career path for members of the\nmendicant orders at the time. Marchia\u2019s Parisian lectures on the\nSentences were delivered during the 1319\u201320 academic\nyear. What little information we have suggests that Marchia remained in Paris at least until 1323, by which time he had most likely been promoted to master\nof theology. He did not attend the Franciscan General Chapter in Perugia in 1322, although in 1321 he may have visited the court of King Robert of Anjou, then residing in Avignon. A document of April 1328 places Marchia as lector at\nthe Franciscan convent in Avignon (Nicolaus Minorita 1996, 189), the\nsite of the papal court, but we have no solid evidence for his earlier\npresence there. (Marchia\u2019s stay in Avignon is commonly thought to have begun by\n1324, but this is based on an error: a reference to Marchia\u2019s confr\u00e8re Francis of Meyronnes in the Quodlibet of the Augustinian James of Pamiers was misinterpreted as citing Marchia. Without contemporary documentation, later\nwriters claimed that Marchia was elected Franciscan provincial minister\nof his native area, Marchia, in 1327, but Roberto Lambertini has found evidence definitively refuting this assertion.)\n\nThe 1328 document concerns Marchia\u2019s falling out with\nPope John XXII for supporting the Franciscan Minister General Michael\nof Cesena on the issue of apostolic poverty. The next month Marchia\nfled Avignon with William of Ockham and others, first going to Pisa,\nwhere, under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor Louis of\nBavaria, Marchia and Ockham respectively were the top witnesses to a\ndocument composed against Pope John in September 1328 (Nicolaus\nMinorita 1996, 423, 455). Soon afterwards Marchia apparently went on a\nmission to France, for in February of 1329 Pope John wrote to Elias of\nNabinaux, then Franciscan bachelor of the Sentences at Paris,\nordering him to arrest Marchia and ship him to Avignon under guard\n(CUP II, no. 886). The pope had heard recently that Marchia had gone\n\u201cto Paris and other parts of France to spread the worst errors and to\nturn the hearts of the faithful religious and others, especially our\nmost dear children in Christ the illustrious king and queen, as well\nas other princes and magnates, from their devotion to the Church.\u201d The\nFranciscans at Paris loyal to the pope moved against the rebels in\nJune. Marchia and his colleagues continued to write against the pope;\nthe pope responded in the bull Quia vir reprobus of 16\nNovember 1329. Meanwhile Marchia had taken refuge in Munich at the\ncourt of the Emperor, along with Cesena, Ockham, Marsilius of Padua,\nand others. It was in Munich, probably around the start of the new\nyear, 1330, that Marchia began to write his Improbatio\nagainst John XXII\u2019s bull (Lambertini 2006a, 187\u20139). Marchia remained a\nfugitive and important papal adversary for several years, well into\nthe reign of Pope Benedict XII, but he was eventually\ncaptured. Although there are problems with the date, a document\nindicates that Marchia\u2019s trial began in early 1341. He confessed and\nretracted his errors before the Inquisition at the end of 1343\n(Wittneben-Lambertini 1999, 2000). Thus reconciled with the Church,\nFrancis of Marchia disappears from the historical record.\n\nFrom Marchia\u2019s Parisian lectures of 1319\u201320 we have a popular commentary on all four books of the Sentences, extant in at least ten manuscripts\nfor each book, with two distinct redactions of book I and two differing versions of books III and IV, alongside various abbreviations (on Marchia\u2019s works, see Friedman-Schabel 2001 and Marchia 2008, xix\u2013xxiii). Manuscript Vat. lat. 943 preserves a full redaction of book II and fragments of the other three books of a commentary on the Sentences that Marchia may have composed outside\nParis after studying there, so this could represent Marchia\u2019s early teaching, although it may also be connected with his Paris lectures themselves. Marchia\u2019s sole Quodlibet was probably held in Marchia\u2019s Paris period as well, rather than in Avignon as previously thought, although the first two questions in the modern edition do not belong to Marchia\u2019s text but to John Duns Scotus\u2019 Sentences commentary (Duba 2007, 2008). It is difficult to date Marchia\u2019s literal commentary on\nthe Physics, his short commentary on the first two books of the Metaphysics, and his related question commentary on the first seven books of the\nMetaphysics. The question commentary had been dated to before 1323, but this was based on the erroneous terminus ante quem of 1323 for the question commentary on the Physics of \u2018John the Canon\u2019, actually Francis Marbres, which cites explicitly and copies from Marchia\u2019s Metaphysics questions. Marbres actually composed his work after 1325 and probably around 1330 (Duba 2014a, 445\u20136; Schabel 2014).\n\n\nUntil 1991, when Notker Schneider\u2019s monograph on Francis of Marchia\u2019s cosmological ideas appeared (Schneider 1991), almost none of Marchia\u2019s writings had been published and only\nAnneliese Maier had devoted serious and sustained attention to his thought\n(Maier 1940\u20131958). Since then, however, Nazzareno Mariani has\npublished eight volumes of Marchia\u2019s works: the Improbatio\n(Marchia 1993; also in Italian: Marchia 2001a), the Physics commentary (Marchia 1998), the\nQuodlibet (Marchia 1997, including a transcription of roughly a quarter of\nthe Scriptum version of book I of the Sentences\ncommentary and two questions from book II in appendices), the four\nPrincipia and the Prologue to his Sentences\nlectures, the Reportatio\nversion of book I of the Sentences commentary (Marchia\n2003, 2006a, 2007, 2009), and finally the Metaphysics commentary (Marchia 2012; in Italian: Marchia 2013a). While Mariani has edited the Reportatio of book I, Russell Friedman and Christopher\nSchabel have laid the foundations for the Scriptum edition\n(Friedman 1997, 1999; Marchia 1999, 2000, 2001b), and Girard J. Etzkorn has completed a working edition of the entire book. For book II, Etzkorn\u2019s edition of the Vat. lat. 943\nversion is forthcoming, and the critical edition of the main redaction has already been published in three volumes by Tiziana\nSuarez-Nani, William Duba, Etzkorn,\nEmmanuel Babey, and Delphine Carron (Marchia 2008, 2010, 2013b). Duba is completing an edition of the versions of book III (Duba 2003\u201304; Duba-Schabel 2006\u201308), and Roberto\nLambertini and Schabel have been untangling book IV (Lambertini 2004,\n2006b; Marchia 2006b, 2006c; Katsoura-Papamarkou-Schabel 2006).\n\n With the edition of many of Marchia\u2019s works thus completed and the\nremainder in progress, Marchia studies have matured since the first\nversion of this entry was published in early 2001. Six papers on Marchia were presented at the SIEPM congress on medieval philosophy in Porto in 2002, a special issue\nof Vivarium was devoted to Marchia in 2006 and published as\na book (Friedman-Schabel 2006), a monograph on Marchia appeared in 2008 (Folger-Fonfara 2008), and a volume of Tiziana Suarez-Nani\u2019s revised articles on Marchia will appear shortly (Suarez-Nani 2015). The journal Picenum\nSeraphicum, edited by Roberto Lambertini, continues to be a\nforum for Marchia studies. Most impressively, with the initiative\nof the Comune di Appignano del Tronto under the leadership of Domenico\nPriori, the Centro Studi Francesco d\u2019Appignano was established in\nMarchia\u2019s hometown in May of 2001 during the First International\nConference on Francis of Marchia. With the publication of the proceedings of the sixth such\nconference in 2014 (Priori 2014), some fifty studies on Marchia by leading scholars have appeared from these venues alone, and the seventh meeting is\nplanned for 2016. Thus around one hundred new studies have\nappeared dealing with different aspects of Marchia\u2019s thought. Many questions about his works have been settled, but\nnew disagreements have arisen, for example about the relative\nchronology of the Vat. lat. 943 version of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary, the character of the main versions of\nbook IV, the respective dating and nature of the\nScriptum and Reportatio on book I, and the authenticity of sermons attributed to him (Friedman-Schabel\n2001; Mariani 2002; Friedman 2004; Schabel 2004; Lambertini 2004;\nLambertini 2006b; Alliney 2006a; Katsoura-Papamarkou-Schabel\n2006\u201308; Lambertini 2009a; Duba 2014b). There is also significant\ndebate about Marchia\u2019s thought, as will be seen below in\nthe section on natural philosophy.\n\nMuch work from the past few years has concentrated on Marchia\u2019s ideas in metaphysics, both in his commentaries on the Aristotelian work and in the various versions of his Sentences commentary. In particular, Marchia has been singled out for the theory of \u2018supertranscendentals\u2019 and for his explicit distinction between special and general metaphysics, foreshadowing an early modern development. There is some indication that Marchia\u2019s innovations in metaphysics were influential into the fifteenth century, but more research is called for (see especially Folger-Fonfara 2008; Amerini 2008b; Aertsen 2012; Duba 2014a). In anticipation of the reaction of\nthe scholarly community to these and other new studies and of the further\ncontextualization of Marchia\u2019s ideas, the present edition of this\nentry will concentrate on what is already known to be both distinctive and\ninfluential in Marchia\u2019s thought.\n",
