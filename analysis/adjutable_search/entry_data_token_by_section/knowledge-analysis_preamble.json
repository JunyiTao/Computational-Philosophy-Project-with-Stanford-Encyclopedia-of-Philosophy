    "main_text": "\n\nFor any person, there are some things they know, and some things they\ndon\u2019t. What exactly is the difference? What does it take to know\nsomething? It\u2019s not enough just to believe it\u2014we\ndon\u2019t know the things we\u2019re wrong about. Knowledge seems\nto be more like a way of getting at the truth. The analysis of\nknowledge concerns the attempt to articulate in what exactly this kind\nof \u201cgetting at the truth\u201d consists.\n\nMore particularly, the project of analysing knowledge is to state\nconditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for\npropositional knowledge, thoroughly answering the question, what does\nit take to know something? By \u201cpropositional knowledge\u201d,\nwe mean knowledge of a proposition\u2014for example, if Susan knows\nthat Alyssa is a musician, she has knowledge of the proposition that\nAlyssa is a musician. Propositional knowledge should be distinguished\nfrom knowledge of \u201cacquaintance\u201d, as obtains when Susan\nknows Alyssa. The relation between propositional knowledge and the\nknowledge at issue in other \u201cknowledge\u201d locutions in\nEnglish, such as knowledge-where (\u201cSusan knows where she\nis\u201d) and especially knowledge-how (\u201cSusan knows how to\nride a bicycle\u201d) is subject to some debate (see Stanley 2011 and\nhis opponents discussed therein).\n\nThe propositional knowledge that is the analysandum of the analysis of\nknowledge literature is paradigmatically expressed in English by\nsentences of the form \u201cS knows that p\u201d,\nwhere \u201cS\u201d refers to the knowing subject, and\n\u201cp\u201d to the proposition that is known. A proposed\nanalysis consists of a statement of the following form: S knows\nthat p if and only if j, where j indicates the\nanalysans: paradigmatically, a list of conditions that are\nindividually necessary and jointly sufficient for S to have\nknowledge that p.\n\nIt is not enough merely to pick out the actual extension of knowledge.\nEven if, in actual fact, all cases of S knowing that p\nare cases of j, and all cases of the latter are cases of the\nformer, j might fail as an analysis of knowledge. For example,\nit might be that there are possible cases of knowledge\nwithout j, or vice versa. A proper analysis of knowledge should\nat least be a necessary truth. Consequently, hypothetical thought\nexperiments provide appropriate test cases for various analyses, as we\nshall see below.\n\nEven a necessary biconditional linking knowledge to some state\nj would probably not be sufficient for an analysis of\nknowledge, although just what more is required is a matter of some\ncontroversy. According to some theorists, to analyze knowledge is\nliterally to identify the components that make up\nknowledge\u2014compare a chemist who analyzes a sample to learn its\nchemical composition. On this interpretation of the project of\nanalyzing knowledge, the defender of a successful analysis of\nknowledge will be committed to something like the metaphysical claim\nthat what it is for S to know p is for some\nlist of conditions involving S and p to obtain. Other\ntheorists think of the analysis of knowledge as distinctively\nconceptual\u2014to analyse knowledge is to limn the\nstructure of the concept of knowledge. On one version of this\napproach, the concept knowledge is literally composed of more\nbasic concepts, linked together by something like Boolean operators.\nConsequently, an analysis is subject not only to extensional accuracy,\nbut to facts about the cognitive representation of knowledge and other\nepistemic notions. In practice, many epistemologists engaging in the\nproject of analyzing knowledge leave these metaphilosophical\ninterpretive questions unresolved; attempted analyses, and\ncounterexamples thereto, are often proposed without its being made\nexplicit whether the claims are intended as metaphysical or conceptual\nones. In many cases, this lack of specificity may be legitimate, since\nall parties tend to agree that an analysis of knowledge ought at\nleast to be extensionally correct in all metaphysically possible\nworlds. As we shall see, many theories have been defended and,\nespecially, refuted, on those terms.\n\nThe attempt to analyze knowledge has received a considerable amount of\nattention from epistemologists, particularly in the late\n20th Century, but no analysis has been widely accepted.\nSome contemporary epistemologists reject the assumption that knowledge\nis susceptible to analysis.\n",
