    "main_text": "Premises and Conclusions\n4. Premises and Conclusions\n\nThere has also been dissent, even in Aristotle\u2019s day, as to the\n\u201cshape\u201d of logical consequence. In particular, there is no\nsettled consensus on the number of premises or conclusions appropriate\nto \u201ctie together\u201d the consequence relation.\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic, a syllogism relates two or more\npremises and a single conclusion. In fact, Aristotle focuses on\narguments with exactly two premises (the major premise and the minor\npremise), but nothing in his definition forbids arguments with three\nor more premises. Surely, such arguments should be permitted: if, for\nexample, we have one syllogism from two premises \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) to a conclusion \\(C\\), and we have another from the\npremises \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) to the conclusion \\(E\\), then\nin some sense, the longer argument from premises \\(A,\nB\\) and \\(D\\) to conclusion \\(E\\) is a good one. It\nis found by chaining together the two smaller arguments. If the two\noriginal arguments are formally valid, then so too is the longer\nargument from three premises. On the other hand, on a common reading\nof Aristotle\u2019s definition of syllogism, one-premise\narguments are ruled out\u2014but this seems arbitrary, as even\nAristotle\u2019s own \u201cconversion\u201d inferences are thus\nexcluded. \n\nFor such reasons, many have taken the relation of logical consequence\nto pair an arbitrary (possibly infinite) collection of\npremises with a single conclusion. This account has the added virtue\nof having the special case of an empty collection of premises.\nArguments to a conclusion from no premises whatsoever are those in\nwhich the conclusion is true by logic alone. Such\n\u201cconclusions\u201d are logical truths (sometimes\ntautologies) or, on the proof-centered approach,\ntheorems.\n\nPerhaps there is a reason to allow the notion of logical consequence\nto apply even more broadly. In Gentzen\u2019s proof theory for\nclassical logic, a notion of consequence is defined to hold between\nmultiple premises and multiple conclusions. The argument from a set\n\\(X\\) of premises to a set \\(Y\\) of conclusions is valid if\nthe truth of every member of \\(X\\) guarantees (in the relevant\nsense) the truth of some member of \\(Y\\). There is no doubt that\nthis is formally perspicuous, but the philosophical applicability of\nthe multiple premise\u2014multiple conclusion sense of logical\nconsequence remains an open philosophical issue. In particular, those\nanti-Realists who take logical consequence to be defined in terms of\nproof (such as Michael Dummett) reject a multiple conclusion\nanalysis of logical consequence. For an Anti-realist, who takes good\ninference to be characterised by the way warrant is\ntransmitted from premise to conclusion, it seems that a multiple\nconclusion analysis of logical consequence is out of the question. In\na multiple conclusion argument from \\(A\\) to \\(B,\nC\\), any warrant we have for \\(A\\) does not necessarily\ntransmit to \\(B\\) or \\(C\\): the only conclusion we are\nwarranted to draw is the disjunction \\(B\\) or \\(C\\), so it seems for\nan analysis of consequence in terms of warrant we need to understand\nsome logical vocabulary (in this case, disjunction) in order to\nunderstand the consequence relation. This is unacceptable if we hope\nto use logical consequence as a tool to define that logical\nvocabulary. No such problems appear to arise in a single conclusion\nsetting. (However, see Restall (2005) for a defence of multiple\nconclusion consequence for Anti-realists; and see Beall (2011) for a\ndefence of certain sub-classical multiple-conclusion logics in the\nservice of non-classical solutions to paradox.)\n\nAnother line along which the notion has been broadened (or along which\nsome have sought to broaden it) involves recent work on\n substructural logic.\n The proposal here is that we may consider doing without some of the\nstandard rules governing the way that premises (or conclusions) of an\nargument may be combined. Structural rules deal with the\nshape or structure of an argument in the sense of\nthe way that the premises and conclusions are collected together, and\nnot the way that those statements are constructed. The structural rule\nof weakening for example, states that if an argument from\nsome collection of premises \\(X\\) to a conclusion \\(C\\) is\nvalid, then the argument from \\(X\\) together with another premise\n\\(A\\) to the conclusion \\(C\\) is also valid. This rule has\nseemed problematic to some (chiefly on the grounds that the extra\npremise \\(A\\) need not be used in the derivation of the\nconclusion \\(C\\) and hence, that \\(C\\) does not follow\nfrom the premises \\(X,A\\) in the appropriate sense).\n Relevant logics\n are designed to respect this thought, and do without the structural\nrule of weakening. (For the proof-theoretic picture, see Negri and von\nPlato (2001).) \n\nOther structural rules are also a called into question. Another\npossible application of substructural logic is found in the analysis\nof paradoxes such as\n Curry\u2019s paradox.\n A crucial move in the reasoning in Curry\u2019s paradox and other\nparadoxes like it seems to require the step reducing two applications\nof an assumption to a single one (which is then discharged). According\nto some, this step is problematic, and so, they must distinguish an\nargument from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and an argument from\n\\(A, A\\) to \\(B\\). The rule of contraction\nis rejected.\n\nIn yet other examples, the order in which premises are used\nis important and an argument from \\(A, B\\) to \\(C\\)\nis to be distinguished from an argument from \\(B, A\\) to\n\\(C\\). (For more details, consult the entry on\n substructural logics.)\n There is no doubt that the formal systems of substructural logics are\nelegant and interesting, but the case for the philosophical importance\nand applicability of substructural logics is not closed.\n",
