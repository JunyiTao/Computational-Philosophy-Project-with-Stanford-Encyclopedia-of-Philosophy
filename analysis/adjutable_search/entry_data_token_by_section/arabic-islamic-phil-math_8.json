    "main_text": "Epistemology of Mathematics || Applicability and Reliability of Mathematics\n3. Conclusion\n\nWhat is presented here is just a brief report of the interesting\nphilosophical views that medieval Muslim thinkers developed about\nmathematics. It is by no means exhaustive. Many aspects of the views I\ndiscussed here have not yet been studied in the secondary literature.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the philosophy of mathematics of\nmany Muslim philosophers has not been sufficiently addressed by\ncontemporary historians of philosophy. But I hope that the things\nbrought together in this entry have shown that the Islamic tradition\nis a rich resource for innovative ideas and theories pertinent to the\nphilosophy of mathematics (and not\u2014as is usually\nthought\u2014only to the technical aspects of mathematics).\n",
