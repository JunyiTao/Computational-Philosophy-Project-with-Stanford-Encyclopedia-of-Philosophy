    "main_text": "\n\nAlain LeRoy Locke is heralded as the \u201cFather of the Harlem\nRenaissance\u201d for his publication in 1925 of The New\nNegro\u2014an anthology of poetry, essays, plays, music and\nportraiture by white and black artists. Locke is best known as a\ntheorist, critic, and interpreter of African-American literature and\nart. He was also a creative and systematic philosopher who developed\ntheories of value, pluralism and cultural relativism that informed and\nwere reinforced by his work on aesthetics. Locke saw black aesthetics\nquite differently than some of the leading Negro intellectuals of his\nday; most notably W. E. B. Du Bois, with whom he disagreed about the\nappropriate social function of Negro artistic pursuits. Du Bois\nthought it was a role and responsibility of the Negro artist to offer\na representation of the Negro and black experience which might help in\nthe quest for social uplift. Locke criticized this as\n\u201cpropaganda\u201d (AOP 12) and argued that the primary\nresponsibility and function of the artist is to express his own\nindividuality, and in doing that to communicate something of universal\nhuman appeal.\n\nLocke was a distinguished scholar and educator and during his lifetime\nan important philosopher of race and culture. Principal among his\ncontributions in these areas was the development of the notion of\n\u201cethnic race\u201d, Locke's conception of race as primarily a\nmatter of social and cultural, rather than biological, heredity. Locke\nwas in contemporary parlance a racial revisionist, and held the\nsomewhat controversial and paradoxical view that it was often in the\ninterests of groups to think and act as members of a\n\u201crace\u201d even while they consciously worked for the\ndestruction or alteration of pernicious racial categories. Racial\ndesignations were for Locke incomprehensible apart from an\nunderstanding of the specific cultural and historical contexts in\nwhich they grew up. A great deal of Locke's philosophical thinking and\nwriting in the areas of pluralism, relativism and democracy are aimed\nat offering a more lucid understanding of cultural or racial\ndifferences and prospects for more functional methods of navigating\ncontacts between different races and cultures.\n\nLocke, like Du Bois, is often affiliated with the pragmatist\nphilosophical tradition though somewhat surprisingly\u2014surprising\nbecause Locke's actual views are closer substantively to pragmatist\nthinkers Like Dewey, James, and Royce than are Du Bois's\u2014he does\nnot receive as much attention in the writings of contemporary\npragmatist philosophers as does Du Bois. Regardless, he is most\nstrongly identified with the pragmatist tradition, but his\n\u201ccritical pragmatism\u201d, and most specifically his value\ntheory, is also influenced by Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg, F.S.C. Schiller,\nAlexius Meinong, Frantz Brentano, and Christian von Erhenfels. From\nearly on in his education at Harvard University, Locke had an affinity\nfor the pragmatist tradition in philosophy. Locked developed his\nmature views on axiology well in advance of many leading\npragmatists\u2014e.g., Dewey and James. Among pragmatists, Locke has\narguably the most developed and systematic philosophy of value, and\noffers many critical insights concerning democracy.\n",
