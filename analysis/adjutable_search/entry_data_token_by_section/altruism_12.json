Self and others: some radical metaphysical alternatives\n\nAn assumption that many people make about egoistic and altruistic\nmotives is that it is more difficult to justify the latter than the\nformer, or that the former do not require justification whereas the\nlatter do. If someone asks himself, \u201cWhy should I take my own\ngood to be a reason to do anything?\u201d it is tempting to respond\nthat something is amiss in the very asking of this\nquestion\u2014perhaps because there can be no answer to it.\nSelf-interest, it might be said, can be given no justification and\nneeds none. By contrast, since other people are other, it\nseems as though some reason needs to be given for building a bridge\nfrom oneself to those others. In other words, we apparently have to\nfind something in others that justifies our taking an interest in\ntheir well-being, whereas one need not seek something in oneself that\nwould justify self-regard. (Perhaps what we find in others that\njustifies altruism is that they are just like oneself in important\nrespects.) It is worth asking whether this apparent asymmetry between\njustifying self-interest and justifying altruism is real or only\napparent.\n\nOne response to this question is that the asymmetry is illusory\nbecause the very distinction between oneself and others is artificial\nand an obstacle to clear thinking. One can begin to challenge the\nvalidity or importance of the distinction between self and others by\nnoticing how many changes occur in the inner life of what is,\nconventionally speaking, a single \u201cperson\u201d. The mind of a\nnewborn, a child, an adolescent, a young adult, a middle aged person,\nand an old person approaching death\u2014these can have at least as\nmany differences as do those who are conventionally counted as two\ndistinct individuals. If a young man of twenty years sets aside money\nto provide for his retirement in old age, he is saving for someone who\nwill be quite different from himself. Why should that not be called\naltruism rather than self-interest? Why does it matter whether it is\ncalled acting for his own good or for the good of another? (See Parfit\n1984.)\n\nAnother kind of challenge to the validity of the distinction between\nself and others derives from the observation made by David Hume that\nwhen we look within and make an inventory of the contents of our\nmental life, we have no acquaintance with any entity that would\nprovide a reference for the word \u201cself\u201d. Introspection can\ntell us something about sensations, feelings, and thoughts\u2014but\nwe do not have any experience of some entity that is the one who has\nthese sensations, feelings, and thoughts. That point might be regarded\nas a reason to reject the common sense view that when you refer to\nyourself, and distinguish yourself from someone else, there is\nsomething real that you are talking about, or some valid distinction\nbetween yourself and others. It might be thought, in other words, that\nthe ordinary distinction between altruistic and egoistic motives is\nmisguided because there are no such things as selves.\n\nA third metaphysical possibility is this: human beings cannot be\nunderstood one by one, as though each were a self-sufficient and fully\nreal individual. That way of thinking about ourselves fails to\nrecognize the profound way in which we are by our nature social\nbeings. You and I and others are by our nature mere parts of some\nlarger social unit. As an analogy, one might think of the human body\nand such parts of the body as fingers, hands, arms, legs, toes, torso,\nand so on. They cannot exist, much less function properly, in\nisolation. Similarly, it might be said that individual human beings\nare mere fragments of a larger social whole. Accordingly, instead of\nusing the concepts expressed by the terms\n\u201cself-interested\u201d and \u201caltruistic\u201d, we should\nsee ourselves as contributors to the success and well-functioning of\nthe larger community to which we belong (see Brink 2003; Green\n1883).\n\nThe remainder of this essay will set aside these unorthodox\nalternatives to the common sense metaphysical framework that we\nnormally presuppose when we think about self-interested and altruistic\nmotives. It would take us too far afield to examine them. We will\ncontinue to make these assumptions: First, a single individual human\nbeing persists over time from birth to death, even when the mental\nlife of that individual undergoes many changes. Second, there is\nsomeone one is referring to when one talks about oneself, even though\nthere is no object called the \u201cself\u201d that we detect\nintrospectively. And the fact that we do not encounter such an object\nby introspection is no reason to doubt the validity of the distinction\nmade between oneself and others. Third, although certain things (arms,\nlegs, noses, etc.) are by their very nature parts of a whole, no human\nbeing is by nature a part in that same way. Rejecting these ideas, we\nwill continue to assume, with common sense, that for each human being\nthere is such a thing as what is good for that human being; and that\nthe questions, \u201cwhat is good for me?\u201d, \u201cwhat is good\nfor that other individual, who is not me?\u201d are different\nquestions. Accordingly, it is one thing for a reason to be\nself-interested, and another for it to be altruistic (although of\ncourse one and the same act can be supported by both kinds of\nreasons).\n\nAssuming, then, that the distinction between these motives is real,\nthe questions we asked at the beginning of this section remain: Why\nought one to be altruistic? Does one need a justification for being\nmotivated in this way? Is egoistic motivation on a sounder footing\nthan altruistic motivation, in that it stands in no need of\njustification?\n",
