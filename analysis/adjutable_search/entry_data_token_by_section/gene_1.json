    "main_text": "A History of the Gene Within the History of Genetics || Classical and physiological genetics\n1.2 Classical and physiological genetics\n\nMuch of population genetics relied on an abstract concept of the gene\nas a unit inferred through character differences, represented in a\nsymbolism, and used in the mathematical reconstruction or prediction\nof patterns of variation in theoretical, experimental, or natural\nbreeding populations. In the early years of genetics, there was no\nagreement regarding the possibility of identifying units of the\nhereditary material and characterizing their nature and function.\nConsiderations in this direction did not differ much from the\nspeculative theories of the nineteenth century and were indeed mainly\ninformed by them. In 1909 Johannsen coined the term\n\u201cgene\u201d, derived from de Vries\u2019s term\n\u201cpangene\u201d, to disentangle the concept of the hereditary\nunit from any specific theory:\n\n\nIt is meant to express merely the simple idea that\n\u201csomething\u201d in the gametes can condition or take part in\nthe determination of a property of a developing organism. (Johannsen\n1909: 124, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nWith respect to his selection experiments mentioned above, Johannsen\nhad furthermore introduced the distinctions between phenotype and\ngenotype. The former concept initially captured the range of\nfluctuating variation in a quantitative character centering on an\naverage value that characterized a pure line. Later, however, the term\nwas used with respect to an individual\u2019s characteristics for\nboth quantitative and qualitative differences in type. The genotype\nwas the genetically relevant constitution of the germ cells or zygote,\nin other words, the sum of the genes, where genes could only be\nidentified as bearing differences between genotypes resulting in\nphenotypic differences. The phenotype was the result of the\ninteraction of the genotype with the environment in ontogenesis\n(Meunier 2016a; entry on\n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\n The phenotype of the parents, let alone of more distant ancestors,\nthus had no effect on the offspring. The genotype was what passed from\nparents to offspring. Johannsen defined heredity \u201cas the\npresence of identical genes in ancestors and descendants\u201d\n(Johannsen 1911: 159).\n\nParadoxically, the rejection of speculations about the nature and\nfunctioning of hereditary units advocated by Johannsen opened the\npossibility for its investigation as an epistemic object. By\nseparating genes and characters more clearly and treating them as\ncorrelated in terms of differences rather than in terms of growth or\nproduction implied in \u201cAnlage\u201d and similar earlier\nconcepts, characters could take on the epistemic function of an\n\u201cindex\u201d or \u201cmarker\u201d informative of the genetic\ncomposition of gametes and zygotes (Meunier 2016b; Schwartz 2000). The\ngene began to take shape as a material entity when this inferential\nstrategy was combined with observations from microscopic studies of\nreproductive cells that enabled inferences on the role of chromosomes\nin heredity.\n\nIn 1910\u20131911, Thomas Hunt Morgan (1856\u20131945) observed\nseveral mutants in his stocks of Drosophila melanogaster.\nWhen he analyzed these mutants through Mendelian crosses, he found\nthat they were partially linked regarding their inheritance, i.e., the\ncharacters were inherited together in more than the 50% of cases that\nwould be expected if genes were randomly distributed, but in less than\n100% of the cases, which would have suggested that both characters\ndepend on the same gene. Indeed, Morgan found that his characters\ncould be recombined, despite the fact that they were all sex-linked,\ni.e., the genes were associated with whatever determined sex in the\nfruit fly. As every gene was present in two instances (later called\n\u201calleles\u201d), the linkage groups could be assumed to exist\nin pairs and recombination thus suggested exchange between\ncorresponding linkage groups, or \u201ccrossing over\u201d of genes.\nThis again suggested that linked genes appeared in linear order, with\nthe frequency of crossing over between two genes being an indicator of\ntheir proximity. Other characters were found that also formed such\nlinkage groups but were not sex-linked. Based on these assumptions,\nMorgan and his students were able to construct maps of four linkage\ngroups in Drosophila that represented the linear order and\nrelative distance as inferred from recombination frequencies (Carlson\n1966: Ch. 6\u20137).\n\nWhile this account of genes was derived from genetic evidence, i.e.,\nMendelian crosses, the results could be mechanistically explained with\nreference to chromosomes. Chromosomes had been suggested as containing\nhereditary material before, but evidence was not forthcoming until the\nearly twentieth century. Cytologists had been able to observe the\nbehavior of chromosomes the formation of gametes and draw analogies to\nthe segregation and independent assortment of Mendelian units. They\ndemonstrated the role of chromosomes in the determination of sex and\nmade observations which suggested an exchange of materials between\nhomologous chromosomes (Brush 1978; Carlson 1966: Ch. 6; Crow &\nCrow 2002). On this basis, the Morgan group\u2019s account identified\nlinkage groups with chromosomes (Morgan et al. 1915; Vorms 2014). By\nthe 1930s, cytological observations had reached a resolution that\nenabled researchers to correlate genetic linkage map loci with\nphysical landmarks in the chromosomes, leading to cytological maps,\nwhich further facilitated the study of chromosomes in heredity (Falk\n2004; Gannett & Griesemer 2004).\n\nIn this tradition, often referred to as \u201cclassical\ngenetics\u201d, genes were hypothetical material units of the genetic\nmaterial, located in the chromosomes. But unlike the material carriers\nof heredity assumed in the nineteenth century, they did not give rise\nto characters in a straightforward manner. Many-many relations between\ngenes and characters became obvious early on. All characters were\ninfluenced by many genes (polygenic) and most genes affected many\ncharacters (pleiotropic). The only kind of causal statement that was\njustified was that a difference in a gene resulted in one or more\ndifferences on the phenotypic level (Schwartz 2000).\n\nSome questioned the chromosome theory of heredity and the notion of\nseparable corpuscular genes. For instance, in the light of the\n\u201cposition effect\u201d, where genes had different effects\ndepending on their location in the chromosome, Richard Goldschmidt\n(1878\u20131958; 1938) suggested a holistic view of chromosomal\nagency (Allen 1974; Carlson 1966: Chs. 13\u201315). Furthermore,\nwhether justified or not, many embryologists interpreted genetics as a\nform of preformationism, the view that organisms or their parts were\nin some way already given or at least pre-determined in the fertilized\negg or its nucleus, such that development would be the mere\narticulation of the given structures. This interpretation was at odds\nwith the view held by most embryologists, that the organism is the\nresult of a process referred to as epigenesis, in which nucleus,\ncytoplasm and environment interact to transform material and\nstructures (see the entry on\n theories of biological development).\n\nOn their part, geneticists became increasingly interested in the\nchemical nature of genes and their roles in metabolism and\ndevelopment. Several researchers had emphasized analogies between gene\naction and enzyme mediated chemical reactions (Ravin 1977). Using\ntheir terminology, Hermann Muller (1890\u20131967) and others\nobserved that the gene had two characteristics that needed to be\nelucidated. First, it was autocatalytic, i.e., it was capable of\nreproducing itself for cell division and heredity to happen; second,\nit was heterocatalytic, i.e., it was able to facilitate the production\nof other chemical materials to perform its function (Muller 1922,\n1947). What was peculiar regarding the first aspect was that genes\nwere still capable of autocatalysis when they underwent mutational\nchange, and they faithfully reproduced the alteration. Hence, for\nMuller, mutation was the key to the material nature of the gene. In\nthe late 1920s, he and others were able to establish the mutagenic\nagency of radiation (Muller 1927; see Campos 2015: Chs. 5\u20136).\nThe fact that genes could be \u201chit\u201d and changed through\nX-rays supported the idea that they were individual entities that\ncould be physically and chemically characterized.\n\nTo address the immediate chemical function of genes in the cell, i.e.,\ntheir heterocatalytic properties, it was necessary to conceive of the\nphenotype itself in chemical terms. In 1908 Archibald Garrod\n(1857\u20131936; 1909) had found that some medical conditions that\ncould be associated with \u201cerrors in metabolism\u201d were\ninherited in a Mendelian fashion. Subsequently, physiological\ngeneticists studied the relation of genes and catalytic activities.\nConclusive evidence was achieved when George Beadle (1903\u20131989)\nand Edward Tatum (1909\u20131975) used the bread mold Neurospora\ncrassa to search for mutants that affected known nutritional\npathways by growing the fungi on selective media that provided or\nlacked certain substances. This approach established the field of\nbiochemical genetics and stabilized the one gene\u2014one enzyme\nhypothesis, i.e., the view that every gene was involved in the\nproduction of a specific enzyme, which had a specific effect on\ncellular metabolism (Kay 1993: Ch. 7; Kohler 1994: Ch. 7).\n",
