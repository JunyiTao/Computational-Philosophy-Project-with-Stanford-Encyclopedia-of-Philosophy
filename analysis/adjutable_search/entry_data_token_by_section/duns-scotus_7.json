Socrates is human and Plato is\nhuman. Does this mean that there must be some one universal\nreality\u2014humanity\u2014that is somehow repeatable, in\nwhich Socrates and Plato both share? Or is there nothing\nmetaphysically common to them at all? Those who think there is some\nactual universal existing outside the mind are called realists; those\nwho deny extra-mental universals are called nominalists. Scotus was a\nrealist about universals, and like all realists he had to give an\naccount of what exactly those universals are: what their status is,\nwhat sort of existence they have outside the mind. So, in the case of\nSocrates and Plato, the question is \u201cWhat sort of item is this\nhumanity that both Socrates and Plato exemplify?\u201d A related\nquestion that realists have to face is the problem of individuation.\nGiven that there is some extra-mental reality common to Socrates and\nPlato, we also need to know what it is in each of them that makes them\ndistinct exemplifications of that extra-mental reality.\n\nScotus calls the extra-mental universal the \u201ccommon\nnature\u201d (natura communis) and the principle of\nindividuation the \u201chaecceity\u201d (haecceitas). The\ncommon nature is common in that it is \u201cindifferent\u201d to\nexisting in any number of individuals. But it has extra-mental\nexistence only in the particular things in which it exists,\nand in them it is always \u201ccontracted\u201d by the haecceity. So\nthe common nature humanity exists in both Socrates and Plato,\nalthough in Socrates it is made individual by Socrates\u2019s\nhaecceitas and in Plato by Plato\u2019s haecceitas.\nThe humanity-of-Socrates is individual and non-repeatable, as is the\nhumanity-of-Plato; yet humanity itself is common and repeatable, and\nit is ontologically prior to any particular exemplification of it\n(Ordinatio 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1\u20136, translated in\nSpade [1994], 57\u2013113).\n",
