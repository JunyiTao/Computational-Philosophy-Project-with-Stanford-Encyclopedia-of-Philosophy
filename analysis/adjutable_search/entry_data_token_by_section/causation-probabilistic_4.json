This\nentry adopts the terms general causation and actual\ncausation. Causal claims usually have the structure\n\u2018C causes E\u2019. C and E are the\nrelata of the causal claim; we will discuss causal relata in\nmore detail in the next section. General causation and actual\ncausation are often distinguished by their relata. General\ncausal claims, such \u201csmoking causes lung cancer\u201d typically\ndo not refer to particular individuals, places, or times, but only to\nevent-types or properties. Singular causal claims, such as\n\u201cJill\u2019s heavy smoking during the 2000s caused her to\ndevelop lung cancer\u201d, typically do make reference to particular\nindividuals, places, and times. This is an imperfect guide, however;\nfor example, some theories of general causation to be discussed below\ntake their causal relata to be time-indexed.\n\nA related distinction is that general causation is concerned with a\nfull range of possibilities, whereas actual causation is concerned\nwith how events actually play out in a specific case. At a minimum, in\nclaims of actual causation, \u201ccause\u201d functions as a success\nverb. The claim \u201cJill\u2019s heavy smoking during the 2000s\ncaused her to develop lung cancer\u201d implies that Jill smoked\nheavily during the 2000s and that she developed lung cancer.\n\nThe theories to be discussed in Sections\n 2\n and\n 3\n below primarily concern general causation, while\n Section 4\n discusses theories of actual causation.\n",
