    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches to Delusion\n3. Theoretical Approaches to Delusion\n\nThere are several theoretical approaches to delusion formation which\nattempt to explain the surface features of delusions by reference to\nunusual experiences, reasoning biases, neuropsychological deficits,\nmotivational factors, and prediction errors, but the task of\ndescribing the behavioral manifestations of delusions, and\nreconstructing their etiology is made difficult by the variation\nobserved both in the form and in the content of delusions. When the\ndistinction between functional and organic delusion was still widely\naccepted, functional delusions were primarily explained on the basis\nof psychodynamic factors, whereas organic delusions mostly received a\nneurobiological explanation. At the present stage of empirical\ninvestigation in the formation of delusional states, the received view\nis that all delusions are due to neuropsychological deficits,\nwhich might include motivational factors.\n",
