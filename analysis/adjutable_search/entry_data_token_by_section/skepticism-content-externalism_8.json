    "main_text": "A Successful Anti-Skeptical Argument?\n9. A Successful Anti-Skeptical Argument?\n\nIt is doubtful whether Putnam\u2019s causal constraint alone can be\nused to show, in a manner that does not beg the question, that any\narbitrary person is not a BIV. However, it is possible to show, using\nPutnam\u2019s causal constraint, that the argument (SA) for\nskepticism mentioned above that uses both the BIV scenario and the\nclosure principle (CP) is, in a sense, self defeating. Here,\nrecall, is (SA):\n\n(SA)  (1)\nYou know that the proposition that you have a\nbody entails that you are not a brain in a vat.\n[Premise]\n  \n\u2234 (2) \nIf you know that you have a body, then you know that\nyou are not a brain in a vat. [By (1) and (CL)]\n  \n(3)  But\nyou don\u2019t know that you are not a brain in a\nvat. [Premise]\n  \n\u2234 (4) \nYou don\u2019t know that you have a body. [By\n(2) and (3)]\n\n\nIn their arguments against skepticism, Putnam and his defenders have\nbeen mainly concerned with providing arguments against premise (3) of\n(SA). But in fact, Premise 1 of the skeptical argument itself may\nprovide the best reason for doubting Premise 3 of that argument. For\nconsider the following anti-skeptical argument (AS):\n\n(AS)  (1)\nYou know that the proposition that you have a\nbody entails that you are not a brain in a vat. [Premise (1) of\n(SA)]\n  \n\u2234 (2) \nYou have the concept of a BIV. [By\n(1)]\n  \n(3)  But\nno BIV has the concept of a BIV. [By the causal\nconstraint.] \n  \n\u2234 (4) \nYou are not a BIV. [By (2),\n(3)]\n\n\n(The inference from (1) to (2) here requires two additional, and I\nhope obvious, assumptions: (1a) Knowing a proposition requires having\nthe concepts necessary for thinking the proposition, and (1b) The\nconcept of a BIV is one by which the known proposition is\ngrasped.)\n\nOf course, the conclusion (4) of (AS) (\u201cYou are not a\nBIV\u201d) does not imply that you know that you are not a\nBIV. However, note that all of the other anti-skeptical arguments\nconsidered so far also have this feature; they all have the conclusion\nthat the relevant agent is not a BIV. It is then inferred that the\nagent knows that she is not a brain in a vat by virtue of her\nhaving deduced the conclusion that she is not a BIV from premises that\nshe knows, always including assumed knowledge of the causal\nconstraint.\n\nIn this manner, any agent to whom the skeptical argument (SA) is\naddressed may also reason through the argument (AS) to the conclusion\nthat she is not a BIV and then to the further conclusion that\nshe knows that she is not a BIV, and hence that premise (3)\nof the skeptical argument is false. Thus in any such case, if the\nrelevant instance of premise (1) of (SA) is true, then the\ncorresponding instance of premise (3) will be false. Thus in any such\ncase, the skeptical argument will be shown to have at least one false\npremise, and the argument (relative to the addressed person) will have\nbeen refuted.\n\nNote that there can be no issue of question-begging in an\nanti-skeptical argument like this. First, it is not the person to whom\nthe skeptical argument is being addressed who is assuming premise (1)\nof both (SA) and (AS). Rather, it is the skeptic who is\nmaking that assumption. Second, the person being addressed can be\ntaken to be assuming premise (1) merely for the sake of\nconditional proof. That is, she can be taken to be arguing\nmerely for the conclusion that if premise (1) is true then\npremise (3) is false, so that at least one of argument (SA)\u2019s\npremises is false.\n\nIt would seem, then, that Putnam\u2019s causal constraint, if it is\nin fact true, can be used to refute the skeptical argument that is\nbased on both the BIV scenario and the closure principle (CP).\n",
