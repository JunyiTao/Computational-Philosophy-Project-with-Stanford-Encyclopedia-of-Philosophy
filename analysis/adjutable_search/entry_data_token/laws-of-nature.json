Other regularities important to science were not\nthought to have this status. These include regularities that, unlike\nlaws, were (or still are) thought by scientists to stand in need of\nstronger ground. These include the regularity of the ocean tides, the\nperihelion of Mercury\u2019s orbit, the photoelectric effect, that\nthe universe is expanding, and so on. Scientists also use laws but not\nother regularities to sort out what is possible: It is based on their\nconsistency with Einstein\u2019s laws of gravity that cosmologists\nrecognize the possibility that our universe is closed and the\npossibility that it is open (Maudlin 2007, 7\u20138). In statistical\nmechanics, the laws of an underlying physical theory are used to\ndetermine the dynamically possible trajectories through the state\nspace of the system (Roberts 2008, 12\u201316).\n\nPhilosophers of science and metaphysicians address various issues\nabout laws, but the basic question is: What is it to be a\nlaw? Two influential answers are the systems approach (Lewis, 1973,\n1983, 1986, 1994) and the universals approach (Armstrong, 1978, 1983,\n1991, 1993).

Beside the\nbasic question, the recent literature has also focused on (i) whether\nlaws are determined by matters of fact, (ii) the role laws play in the\nproblem of induction, (iii) whether laws involve a strong form of\nnecessity, and (iv) the role of laws in physics and how that contrasts\nwith the role of laws in the special sciences.\n", "toc": [{"#BasQueWhaItLaw": "1.

The Basic Question: What is it to be a Law?\n\nHere are four reasons philosophers examine what it is to be a law of\nnature: First, as indicated above, laws at least appear to have a\ncentral role in scientific practice. Second, laws are important to\nmany other philosophical issues. For example, sparked by the account\nof counterfactuals defended by Chisholm (1946, 1955) and Goodman\n(1947), and also prompted by Hempel and Oppenheim\u2019s (1948)\ndeductive-nomological model of explanation, philosophers have wondered\nwhat makes counterfactual and explanatory claims true, have thought\nthat laws play some part, and so also have wondered what distinguishes\nlaws from nonlaws. Third, Goodman famously suggested that there is a\nconnection between lawhood and confirmability by an inductive\ninference. So, some sympathetic to Goodman\u2019s idea come to the\nproblem of laws as a result of their interest in the problem of\ninduction. Fourth, philosophers love a good puzzle. Suppose that\neveryone here is seated (cf., Langford 1941, 67). Then, trivially,\nthat everyone here is seated is true. Though true, this generalization\ndoes not seem to be a law. It is just too accidental. Einstein\u2019s\nprinciple that no signals travel faster than light is also a true\ngeneralization but, in contrast, it is thought to be a law; it is not\nnearly so accidental. What makes the difference?\n\nThis may not seem like much of a puzzle. That everyone here is seated\nis spatially restricted in that it is about a specific place; the\nprinciple of relativity is not similarly restricted. So, it is easy to\nthink that, unlike laws, accidentally true generalizations are about\nspecific places. But that is not what makes the difference. There are\ntrue nonlaws that are not spatially restricted. Consider the\nunrestricted generalization that all gold spheres are less than one\nmile in diameter. There are no gold spheres that size and in all\nlikelihood there never will be, but this is still not a law. There\nalso appear to be generalizations that could express laws that are\nrestricted. Galileo\u2019s law of free fall is the generalization\nthat, on Earth, free-falling bodies accelerate at a rate of\n9.8 meters per second squared. The perplexing nature of the puzzle is\nclearly revealed when the gold-sphere generalization is paired with a\nremarkably similar generalization about uranium spheres:\n\nAll gold spheres are less than a mile in diameter.\n\n\nAll uranium spheres are less than a mile in diameter.\n\n\nThough the former is not a law, the latter arguably is. The latter is\nnot nearly so accidental as the first, since uranium\u2019s critical\nmass is such as to guarantee that such a large sphere will never exist\n(van Fraassen 1989, 27). What makes the difference? What makes the\nformer an accidental generalization and the latter a law?\n2. Systems\n\nOne popular answer ties being a law to deductive systems. The idea\ndates back to Mill (1843, 384), but has been defended in one form or\nanother by Ramsey (1978 [f.p. 1928]), Lewis (1973, 1983, 1986,\n1994),  Earman (1984) and Loewer (1996). Deductive systems\nare individuated by their axioms. The logical consequences of the\naxioms are the theorems. Some true deductive systems will be stronger\nthan others; some will be simpler than others. These two virtues,\nstrength and simplicity, compete. (It is easy to make a system\nstronger by sacrificing simplicity: include all the truths as\naxioms. It is easy to make a system simple by sacrificing strength:\nhave just the axiom that 2 + 2 = 4.) According to Lewis (1973, 73),\nthe laws of nature belong to all the true deductive systems with a\nbest combination of simplicity and strength. So, for example,\nthe thought is that it is a law that all uranium spheres are less than\na mile in diameter because it is, arguably, part of the best deductive\nsystems; quantum theory is an excellent theory of our universe and\nmight be part of the best systems, and it is plausible to think that\nquantum theory plus truths describing the nature of uranium would\nlogically entail that there are no uranium spheres of that size\n(Loewer 1996, 112). It is doubtful that the generalization that all\ngold spheres are less than a mile in diameter would be part of the\nbest systems. It could be added as an axiom to any system, but it\nwould bring little or nothing of interest in terms of strength and\nadding it would sacrifice something in terms of simplicity. (Lewis\nlater made significant revisions to his account in order to address\nproblems involving physical probability (Lewis 1986, 1994).\n\nMany features of the systems approach are appealing. For one thing,\nit deals with a challenge posed by vacuous laws. Some laws are\nvacuously true: Newton\u2019s first law of motion \u2014 that all\ninertial bodies have no acceleration \u2014 is a law, even though\nthere are no inertial bodies. But there are also lots of vacuously\ntrue nonlaws: all plaid pandas weigh 5 lbs., all unicorns are\nunmarried, etc. With the systems approach, there is no exclusion of\nvacuous generalizations from the realm of laws, and yet only those\nvacuous generalizations that belong to the best systems qualify (cf.,\nLewis 1986, 123). Furthermore, one goal of scientific theorizing\nis the formulation of true theories that are well balanced in terms of\ntheir simplicity and strength. So, the systems approach seems to\nunderwrite the truism that an aim of science is the discovery of laws\n(Earman 1978, 180; Loewer 1996, 112). One last aspect of the systems\nview that is appealing to many (though not all) is that it is in\nkeeping with broadly Humean constraints on a sensible metaphysics.\nThere is no overt appeal to closely related modal concepts (e.g., the\ncounterfactual conditional, causation, dispositions) and no overt\nappeal to modality-supplying entities (e.g., universals or God; for\nthe supposed need to appeal to God, see Foster 2004). Indeed, the\nsystems approach is the centerpiece of Lewis\u2019s defense of\nHumean supervenience, \u201cthe doctrine that all there is\nin the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact,\njust one little thing and then another\u201d (1986, ix).\n\nOther aspects of the systems approach make philosophers wary. (See,\nespecially, Armstrong 1983, 66\u201373; van Fraassen 1989,\n40\u201364; Carroll 1990, 197\u2013206.) Some argue that this\napproach will have the untoward consequence that laws are\ninappropriately mind-dependent in virtue of the account\u2019s appeal\nto the concepts of simplicity, strength and best balance, concepts\nwhose instantiation seems to depend on cognitive abilities, interests,\nand purposes. The appeal to simplicity raises further questions\nstemming from the apparent need for a regimented language to permit\nreasonable comparisons of the systems (Lewis 1983, 367.) More\nrecently, Roberts questions the systems approach at a point sometimes\nthought to be a strength of the view: \u201cWe have no practice of\nweighing competing virtues of simplicity and information content for\nthe purpose of choosing one deductive system over others, where all\nare presumed to be true\u201d (2008, 10). There is the practice of\ncurve-fitting, which involves weighing the competing virtues of\nsimplicity and closeness of fit, but this is a practice that is part\nof the process of discovering what is true. Also, the systems\napproach is ill-suited to rule out widespread and striking\nregularities as laws, even those that are clearly determined by the\ninitial conditions. That the universe is closed, that entropy\ngenerally increases, that the planets of our solar system are\nco-planar, and others (if true) could be added to any true deductive\nsystem, greatly increasing the strength of the system, with only a\nsmall cost in terms of simplicity (Maudlin 2007, 16; Roberts 2008,\n23). Interestingly, sometimes the systems view is abandoned\nbecause it satisfies the broadly Humean constraints\non laws of nature; some argue that what generalizations are laws\nis not determined by local matters of particular fact. (See Section 4\nbelow.) Though Humeans like Lewis generally favor realism to any form\nof anti-realism (Section 5 below), Berenstain and Ladyman (2012)\nhave argued that scientific realism is incompatible with Humeanism\nbecause realism requires a notion of natural necessity not susceptible\nto Humean analysis.\n3. Universals\n\nIn the late 1970s, there emerged a competitor for the systems approach\nand all other Humean attempts to say what it is to be a law. Led by\nArmstrong (1978, 1983, 1991, 1993), Dretske (1977), and Tooley (1977,\n1987), the rival approach appeals to universals (i.e., certain kinds\nof properties and relations) to distinguish laws from nonlaws.\n\nFocusing on Armstrong\u2019s development of the view, here is a\nconcise statement of the framework characteristic of the\nuniversals approach:\n\nSuppose it to be a law that Fs are Gs.\nF-ness and G-ness are taken to be universals. A\ncertain relation, a relation of non-logical or contingent\nnecessitation, holds between F-ness and G-ness. This\nstate of affairs may be symbolized as\n\u2018N(F,G)\u2019 (1983, 85).\n\n\nThis framework promises to address familiar puzzles and problems:\nMaybe the difference between the uranium-spheres generalization and\nthe gold-spheres generalization is that being uranium does necessitate\nbeing less than one mile in diameter, but being gold does not. Worries\nabout the subjective nature of simplicity, strength and best balance\ndo not emerge; there is no threat of lawhood being mind-dependent so\nlong as necessitation is not mind-dependent. Some think that the\nframework supports the idea that laws play a special explanatory role\nin inductive inferences, since a law is not just a universal\ngeneralization, but is an entirely different creature \u2014 a\nrelation holding between two other universals (Armstrong 1991, Dretske\n1977). The framework is also consistent with lawhood not supervening\non local matters of particular fact; the denial of Humean\nsupervenience often accompanies acceptance of the universals\napproach.\n\nFor there truly to be this payoff, however, more has to be said about\nwhat N is. This is a problem van Fraassen calls the\nidentification problem, which he couples this with a second\nproblem, what he calls the inference problem (1989, 96). The\nessence of this pair of problems was captured early on by Lewis with\nhis usual flair:\n\nWhatever N may be, I cannot see how it could be absolutely\nimpossible to have N(F,G) and Fa\nwithout Ga. (Unless N just is constant conjunction,\nor constant conjunction plus something else, in which case\nArmstrong\u2019s theory turns into a form of the regularity theory he\nrejects.) The mystery is somewhat hidden by Armstrong\u2019s\nterminology. He uses \u2018necessitates\u2019 as a name for the\nlawmaking universal N; and who would be surprised to hear\nthat if F \u2018necessitates\u2019 G and\na has F, then a must have G? But I\nsay that N deserves the name of \u2018necessitation\u2019\nonly if, somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary\nconnections. It can\u2019t enter into them just by bearing a name,\nany more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called\n\u2018Armstrong\u2019 (1983, 366).\n\n\nBasically, there needs to be a specification of what the lawmaking\nrelation is (the identification problem). Then, there needs to be a\ndetermination of whether it is suited to the task (the inference\nproblem): Does N\u2019s holding between F and\nG entail that Fs are Gs? Does its holding\nsupport corresponding counterfactuals? Do laws really turn out not to\nsupervene, to be mind-independent, to be explanatory? Armstrong does\nsay more about what his lawmaking relation is. He states in reply to\nvan Fraassen:\n\nIt is at this point that, I claim, the Identification problem has been\nsolved. The required relation is the causal relation, \u2026 now\nhypothesized to relate types not tokens (1993, 422).\n\n\nQuestions remain about the nature of this causal relation understood\nas a relation that relates both token events and universals. (See van\nFraassen 1993, 435\u2013437, and Carroll 1994, 170\u2013174.)\n4. Humean Supervenience\n\nRather than detailing all the critical issues that divide the\nsystems approach and the universals approach, attention has been on\nthe divisive issue of supervenience (i.e., determination). It concerns\nwhether Humean considerations really determine what the laws are.\nThere are some important examples that appear to show that they do\nnot.\n\n\nSuppose that there are ten different kinds of fundamental particles.\nSo, there are fifty-five possible kinds of two-particle interactions.\nSuppose that fifty-four of these kinds have been studied and\nfifty-four laws have been discovered. The interaction of X\nand Y particles have not been studied because conditions are\nsuch that they never will interact. Nevertheless, it seems that it\nmight be a law that, when X particles and Y\nparticles interact, P occurs. Similarly it might be a law\nthat when X and Y particles interact, Q\noccurs. There seems to be nothing about the local matters of\nparticular fact in this world that fixes which of these\ngeneralizations is a law (Tooley 1977, 669).\n\n\nThe failure of supervenience arises in other cases. Consider the\npossibility that there is a lone particle traveling through otherwise\nempty space at a constant velocity of, say, one meter per second. It\nseems that this might just be a nearly empty Newtonian universe in\nwhich it is accidentally true that all bodies have a velocity of one\nmeter per second; it just so happens that there is nothing to alter\nthe particle\u2019s motion. But, it might also be the case that this\nworld is not Newtonian and that it is a law that all bodies have\nvelocity at one meter per second; it could be that this generalization\nis not accidental and would have held true even if there were other\nbodies slamming into the lone particle. (Earman 1986, 100; Lange 2000,\n85\u201390.)\n\nMaudlin presses the case against the Humeans by focusing on the common\npractice among physicists of considering models of a theory\u2019s\nlaws.\n\nMinkowski space-time, the space-time of Special Relativity, is a model\nof the field equations of General Relativity (in particular, it is a\nvacuum solution). So an empty Minkowski space-time is one way the\nworld could be if it is governed by the laws of General Relativity.\nBut is Minkowski space-time a model only of the General\nRelativistic laws? Of course not! One could, for example, postulate\nthat Special Relativity is the complete and accurate account of\nspace-time structure, and produce another theory of gravitation, which\nwould still have the vacuum Minkowski space-time as a model. So under\nthe assumption that no possible world can be governed by the laws of\nGeneral Relativity and by a rival theory of gravity, the total\nphysical state of the world cannot always determine the laws (2007,\n67).\n\n\nThe suggestion here is that there is the possibility of a matter-less\nuniverse with the laws of General Relativity and another with laws of\na conflicting theory of gravitation. (For additional examples, see\nCarroll 1994, 60\u201380). What Maudlin sees as a consequence of\nstandard scientific reasoning, Humeans will see as an example exposing\nthe absurdity of nonsupervenience.\n\nHumeans contend that the various pairs of so-called possible worlds\nare not really possible. Sometimes this contention turns on the issue\nof whether laws govern, sometimes on epistemological or ontological\nconcerns, and sometimes on concerns about about how our language\nworks. One objection to the nonsupervenience arguments from the Humean\ncamp is that, if one comes to the debate with the governing conception\nin mind, one is likely to find the antisupervenience examples\nconvincing, but using this conception to reject Humean analyses of\nlawhood is somehow to beg the question or to otherwise be unconvincing\nbecause it is a conception Humeans reject (Beebee, 2000). (Also see\nLoewer 1996 and Roberts 1998.) In contrast, some are sympathetic to\nHumeanism and aspects of the governing conception (Schneider 2007,\nWard 2007, Roberts 2008). In particular, when we consider laws\ngoverning the nation, the laws don\u2019t do anything to the\ngoverned. What governs is the government that creates and\nenforces the laws. \u201cThe proposition that we call the law is not\nthe agent of the governing, but the content of the governing\u201d\n(Roberts 2008, 46).\n\nSome argue based on skeptical considerations that their brand of\nHumean supervenience is true (Earman and Roberts 2005ab). Others\nreject skeptical concerns (Schaffer 2008, 94\u201399, Carroll\n2008, 75\u201379). Schaffer presses an ontological concern\nto the effect that nonsupervening laws are ungrounded entities\n(Schaffer 2008, 84\u201385).\n\nAn original manner of responding to apparent counterexamples to\nsupervenience takes a semantic turn. In the lone-particle example\nreported above, there is a world with the lone particle traveling at\none meter per second, though it is not a law that all particles travel\nat that speed. There is also a world with the lone particle traveling\nat one meter per second, though it is a law that all particles are\ntraveling at that speed. This reasoning does not contradict\nsupervenience because of the context sensitivity of the predicate,\n\u2018is a law\u2019. Though the sentence, \u2018It is a law that\nall particles travel at one meter per second\u2019 is (i) true\nrelative to one context/world pair and (ii) false relative to a\ndifferent context/world pair. This difference in truth-value could\nmerely be the result of a difference between two contexts (Roberts\n2008, 357\u201361).\n\nFor Roberts, a possible world w in which there exists only a\nsingle particle traveling at constant velocity throughout all of\nhistory and relative to a context in which the salient theory is, say,\nNewtonian Mechanics, \u2018It is a law that all particles have a\nconstant velocity of one meter per second\u2019 is true just in case\nthe reference of the \u2018that\u2019 clause plays the law role in\nthe salient theory, which it doesn\u2019t in this case. It might\nplay the law role relative to some other theory, but this would\nbe a different context. A single generalization cannot\nboth play the law role and also not play the law role relative to a\nsingle theory, and so a different salient theory and so a different\ncontext is required for \u2018It is a law that all bodies travel at\none meter per second\u2019 to be true (Roberts 2008, 357\u201361). \nWhat is enticing about this reply is that it does not reject any\nintuitive claim about the laws in the various possible worlds. The\nantisupervenience judgments about what are the laws are reasonable\nclaims given the contexts. It is just that there is a failure to\nrecognize the influence of context. So, for example, Maudlin\u2019s\nso-called two possibilities would be seen by Roberts as descriptions\nof a single possibility that are made relative to two contexts with\ndifferent salient theories: General Relativity and some rival theory\nof gravity. (Parallel points could be made about Tooley\u2019s\nexamples involving the 10 different kinds of fundamental particles.)\nThe key is the context sensitivity that is built into the truth\nconditions of lawhood sentences. Other views that take lawhood\nsentences to be context sensitive might also be able to avail\nthemselves of Roberts\u2019 challenge to the antisupervenience\nexamples. What is not compelling about Roberts\u2019 position,\nthough, is his view on the context dependence of lawhood ascriptions.\nHis view is devised for one particular phrase of English:\n\u2018law of nature\u2019, but it would be better if the\ncontextual treatment of \u2018law of nature\u2019 melded neatly\nwith the context dependence of other natural language words and\nphrases. We should try to understand the context dependence of our\n\u2018law of nature\u2019 talk by appeal to linguistic principles,\nand the investigation should be driven by considerations of\nconversational practice (Carroll 2018, 131\u201332). \u2018Law of\nnature\u2019 should not be an isolated freak of our language\n(cf., Unger 1971, 202) on the verb \u2018to know\u2019.\n5. Antirealism \n\nThe majority of contemporary philosophers are realists about\nlaws; they believe that some reports of what the laws are succeed in\ndescribing reality. There are, however, some antirealists who\ndisagree.\n\nFor example, van Fraassen, Giere, and also Mumford believe that\nthere are no laws. Van Fraassen finds support for his view in the\nproblems facing accounts like Lewis\u2019s and Armstrong\u2019s, and\nthe perceived failure of Armstrong and others to describe an adequate\nepistemology that permits rational belief in laws (1989,\n130, 180\u2013181). Giere appeals to the origins of the use of\nthe concept of law in the history of science (1999 [f.p. 1995],\n86\u201390) and contends that the generalizations often described as\nlaws are not in fact true (90\u201391). Mumford\u2019s reasons are\nmore metaphysical; he maintains that, in order to govern, laws must be\nexternal to the properties they govern, but, to be external in this\nway, the governed properties must lack proper identity conditions\n(2004, 144\u2013145). Others adopt a subtly different sort of\nantirealism. Though they will utter sentences like \u2018It is a law\nthat no signals travel faster than light\u2019, they are antirealists\nin virtue of thinking that such sentences are not (purely)\nfact-stating. Whether this Einsteinian generalization is a law is not\na fact about the universe; it is not something out there waiting to be\ndiscovered. Reports of what are laws only project a certain attitude\n(in addition to belief) about the contained generalizations (Blackburn\n1984, 1986, Ward 2002, 197). Ward takes the attitude to be one\nregarding the suitability of the generalization for prediction and\nexplanation. \n\nThe challenge for antirealism is to minimize the havoc lawless reality\nwould play with our folk and scientific practices. Regarding science,\nthe examples and uses of laws described at the start of this entry\nattest to \u2018law\u2019 having a visible role in science that\nscientists seem prepared to take as factive. Regarding our folk\npractices, though \u2018law\u2019 is not often part of\nrun-of-the-mill conversations, an antirealism about lawhood would\nstill have wide-ranging consequences. This is due to lawhood\u2019s\nties to other concepts, especially the nomic ones, concepts\nlike the counterfactual conditional, dispositions, and causation. For\nexample, it seems that, for there to be any interesting counterfactual\ntruths, there must be at least one law of nature. Would an ordinary\nmatch in ordinary conditions light if struck? It seems it would, but\nonly because we presume nature to be regular in certain ways. We think\nthis counterfactual is true because we believe there are laws. Were\nthere no laws, it would not be the case that, if the match were\nstruck, it would light. As a result, it would also not be the case\nthat the match was disposed to ignite, nor the case that\nstriking the match would cause it to light.\n\nCould an antirealist deflect this challenge by denying the connections\nbetween lawhood and other concepts? Would this allow one to be an\nantirealist about laws and still be a realist about, say,\ncounterfactuals? The danger lurking here is that the resulting\nposition seems bound to be ad hoc. Concepts like the\ncounterfactual conditional, dispositions, and causation exhibit many\nof the same puzzling features that lawhood does; there are parallel\nphilosophical questions and puzzles about these concepts. It is hard\nto see what would warrant antirealism about lawhood, but not the other\nnomic concepts.\n6. Antireductionism\n\nSome advocate antireductionist, antisupervenience views (Carroll 1994,\n2008, Ismael 2015, Lange 2000, 2009, Maudlin 2007, Woodward\n1992). Regarding the question of what it is to be a law, they\nreject the answers given by Humeans; they often deny Humean\nsupervenience, and they see no advantage in an appeal to universals.\nThey reject all attempts to say what it is to be a law that do not\nappeal to nomic concepts. Yet they still believe that there really are\nlaws of nature; they are not antirealists. Maudlin takes\nlawhood to be a primitive status and laws to be ontological primitives\n\u2014 fundamental entities in our ontology. His project is to show\nwhat work laws can do, defining physical possibility in terms of laws\nand sketching law-based accounts of the counterfactual conditional and\nof explanation. Carroll\u2019s analysis of lawhood is in\nterms of causal/explanatory concepts. The starting point is the\nintuition that laws are not accidental, that they are not\ncoincidences. Not being a coincidence, however, is not all there is to\nbeing a law. For example, it might be true that there are no gold\nspheres greater than 1000 miles in diameter because there is so little\ngold in the universe. In that case, strictly speaking, that\ngeneralization would be true, suitably general, and not a coincidence.\nNevertheless, that would not be a law. Arguably, what blocks this\ngeneralization from being a law is that something in nature\n\u2014 really, an initial condition of the universe, the limited\namount of gold \u2014 accounts for the generalization. Contrast this\nwith the law that inertial bodies have no acceleration. With this and\nother laws, it seems that it holds because of nature (itself). \nLange\u2019s (2000, 2009) treatment includes an account of what it is\nto be a law in terms of a counterfactual notion of stability. The\noverall account is intricate, but the basic idea is this: Call a\nlogically closed set of true propositions stable if and only if the\nmembers of the set would remain true given any antecedent that is\nconsistent with the set itself. So, for example, the set of logical\ntruths is trivially stable, because logical truths would be true no\nmatter what. A set that included the accidental generalization that\nall the people in the room are sitting, but is consistent with the\nproposition that someone in the room shouts \u2018Fire!\u2019 would\nnot be a stable set; if someone were to shout \u2018Fire\u2019, then\nsomeone in the room would not be sitting. Lange argues that no\nstable set of sub-nomic facts \u2014 except maybe the set of all\ntruths \u2014 contains an accidental truth. \u201cBy identifying the\nlaws as the members of at least one non-maximal stable set, we\ndiscover how a sub-nomic fact\u2019s lawhood is fixed by the\nsub-nomic facts and the subjunctive facts about them\u201d (2009,\n43).\n\nAttempts to undermine antireductionism often include challenges to\nantisupervenience like those mentioned at the end of Section 4. \nHildebrand challenges Carroll\u2019s and Maudlin\u2019s\nantireductionisms based on the failure of primitive laws to explain\nthe uniformity of nature (Hildebrand, 2013). A symposium on\nLange\u2019s (2009)  Laws and Lawmakers includes, along with\nLange\u2019s replies, a variety of criticisms from Carroll, Loewer,\nand Woodward. (See Lange et al., 2011.) Demerest (2012)\nraises three challenges to Lange\u2019s antireductionism all centered\non whether subjunctives are suited to play the role of lawmakers.\n7. Induction\n\nGoodman thought that the difference between laws of nature and\naccidental truths was linked inextricably with the problem of\ninduction. In his \u201cThe New Riddle of Induction\u201d (1983,\n[f.p. 1954], 73), Goodman says,\n\nOnly a statement that is lawlike \u2014 regardless of its\ntruth or falsity or its scientific importance \u2014 is capable of\nreceiving confirmation from an instance of it; accidental statements\nare not.\n\n\n(Terminology: P is lawlike only if P is a law if\ntrue.) Goodman claims that, if a generalization is accidental (and so\nnot lawlike), then it is not capable of receiving confirmation from\none of its instances.\n\nThis has prompted much discussion, including some challenges. For\nexample, suppose there are ten flips of a fair coin, and that the\nfirst nine land heads (Dretske 1977, 256\u2013257). The first nine\ninstances \u2014 at least in a sense \u2014 confirm the\ngeneralization that all the flips will land heads; the probability of\nthat generalization is raised from (.5)10\nup to .5. But this generalization is not\nlawlike; if true, it is not a law. It is standard to respond to such\nan example by arguing that this is not the pertinent notion of\nconfirmation (that it is mere \u201ccontent-cutting\u201d) and by\nsuggesting that what does require lawlikeness is confirmation of the\ngeneralization\u2019s unexamined instances. Notice that, in the coin\ncase, the probability that the tenth flip will land heads does not\nchange after the first nine flips land heads. There are, however,\nexamples that generate problems for this idea too.\n\nSuppose the room contains one hundred men and suppose you ask fifty of\nthem whether they are third sons and they reply that they are; surely\nit would be reasonable to at least increase somewhat your expectation\nthat the next one you ask will also be a third son (Jackson and\nPargetter 1980, 423)\n\n\nIt does no good to revise the claim to say that no generalization\nbelieved to be accidental is capable of confirmation. About\nthe third-son case, one would know that the generalization, even if\ntrue, would not be a law. The discussion continues. Frank Jackson and\nRobert Pargetter have proposed an alternative connection between\nconfirmation and laws on which certain counterfactual truths must\nhold: observation of As that are F-and-B\nconfirms that all non-F As are Bs only if\nthe As would still have been both A and B\nif they had not been F. (This suggestion is criticized by\nElliott Sober 1988, 97\u201398.) Lange (2000, 111\u2013142) uses a\ndifferent strategy. He tries to refine further the relevant notion of\nconfirmation, characterizing what he takes to be an intuitive notion\nof inductive confirmation, and then contends that only generalizations\nthat are not believed not to be lawlike can be (in his sense)\ninductively confirmed.\n\nSometimes the idea that laws have a special role to play in induction\nserves as the starting point for a criticism of Humean analyses.\nDretske (1977, 261\u2013262) and Armstrong (1983, 52\u201359, and\n1991) adopt a model of inductive inference that involves an inference\nto the best explanation. (Also see Foster 1983 and 2004.) On its\nsimplest construal, the model describes a pattern that begins with an\nobservation of instances of a generalization, includes an inference to\nthe corresponding law (this is the inference to the best explanation),\nand concludes with an inference to the generalization itself or to its\nunobserved instances. The complaint lodged against Humeans is that, on\ntheir view of what laws are, laws are not suited to explain their\ninstances and so cannot sustain the required inference to the best\nexplanation.\n\nThis is an area where work on laws needs to be done. Armstrong and\nDretske make substantive claims on what can and can\u2019t be\ninstance confirmed: roughly, Humean laws can\u2019t,\nlaws-as-universals can. But, at the very least, these claims cannot be\nquite right. Humean laws can\u2019t? As the discussion above\nillustrates, Sober, Lange and others have argued that even\ngeneralizations known to be accidental can be confirmed by their\ninstances. Dretske and Armstrong need some plausible and suitably\nstrong premise connecting lawhood to confirmability and it is not\nclear that there is one to be had. Here is the basic problem: As many\nauthors have noticed (e.g., Sober 1988, 98; van Fraassen 1987, 255),\nthe confirmation of a hypothesis or its unexamined instances will\nalways be sensitive to what background beliefs are in place. So much\nso that, with background beliefs of the right sort, just about\nanything can be confirmed irrespective of its status as a law or\nwhether it is lawlike. Thus, stating a plausible principle describing\nthe connection between laws and the problem of induction will be\ndifficult.\n8. Necessity\n\nPhilosophers have generally held that some contingent truths are (or\ncould be) laws of nature. Furthermore, they have thought that, if it\nis a law that all Fs are Gs, then there need not be\nany (metaphysically) necessary connection between F-ness and\nG-ness, that it is (metaphysically) possible that something\nbe F without being G. For example, any possible\nworld that, as a matter of law, obeys the general principles of\nNewtonian physics is a world in which Newton\u2019s first law is\ntrue, and a world containing accelerating inertial bodies is a world\nin which Newton\u2019s first law is false. The latter world is also a\nworld where inertia is instantiated but does not necessitate zero\nacceleration. Some necessitarians, however, hold that all\nlaws are necessary truths. (See Shoemaker 1980 and 1998, Swoyer 1982,\nFales 1990, Bird 2005. See Vetter 2012 for criticism of Bird 2005 from\nwithin the dispositional essentialist camp.) Others have held\nsomething that is only slightly different. Maintaining that some laws\nare singular statements about universals, they allow that some laws\nare contingently true. So, on this view, an\nF-ness/G-ness law could be false if F-ness\ndoes not exist. Still, this difference is minor. These authors think\nthat, for there to be an F-ness/G-ness law, it must\nbe necessarily true that all Fs are Gs. (See\nTweedale 1984, Bigelow, Ellis, and Lierse 1992, Ellis and Lierse 1994,\nand Ellis 2001, 203\u2013228; 2009, 51\u201372.)\n\nTwo reasons can be given for believing that being a law does not\ndepend on any necessary connection between properties. The first\nreason is the conceivability of it being a law in one possible world\nthat all Fs are Gs even though there is another\nworld with an F that is not G. The second is that\nthere are laws that can only be discovered in an a posteriori\nmanner. If necessity is always associated with laws of nature, then it\nis not clear why scientists cannot always get by with a\npriori methods. Naturally, these two reasons are often\nchallenged. The necessitarians argue that conceivability is not a\nguide to possibility. They also appeal to Saul Kripke\u2019s (1972)\narguments meant to reveal certain a posteriori necessary\ntruths in order to argue that the a posteriori nature of some\nlaws does not prevent their lawhood from requiring a necessary\nconnection between properties. In further support of their own view,\nthe necessitarians argue that their position is a consequence of their\nfavored theory of dispositions, according to which dispositions have\ntheir causal powers essentially. So, for example, on this theory,\ncharge has as part of its essence the power to repel like charges.\nLaws, then, are entailed by the essences of dispositions (cf., Bird\n2005, 356). As necessitarians see it, it is also a virtue of their\nposition that they can explain why laws are counterfactual-supporting;\nthey support counterfactuals in the same way that other necessary\ntruths do (Swoyer 1982, 209; Fales 1990, 85\u201387).\n\nThe primary worry for necessitarians concerns their ability to sustain\ntheir dismissals of the traditional reasons for thinking that some\nlaws are contingent. The problem (cf., Sidelle 2002, 311) is that they\ntoo make distinctions between necessary truths and contingent ones,\nand even seem to rely on considerations of conceivability to do so.\nPrima facie, there is nothing especially suspicious about the judgment\nthat it is possible that an object travel faster than light. How is it\nany worse than the judgment that it is possible that it is raining in\nParis? Another issue for necessitarians is whether their essentialism\nregarding dispositions can sustain all the counterfactuals that are\napparently supported by laws of nature (Lange 2004).\n9. Laws, Circularity and Prospects for Explanation\n\nGoing back to Armstrong (1983, 40), there have been\nchallenges to those who hold a Humean account of laws, and about\nwhether Humean laws are explanatory. More recently, Maudlin has\nput the challenge in a perspicuous way:\n\n\nIf one is a Humean, then the Humean Mosaic itself appears to admit of\nno further explanation. Since it is the ontological bedrock in terms\nof which all other existent things are to be explicated, none of these\nfurther things can really account for the structure of the Mosaic\nitself. This complaint has been long voiced, commonly as an objection\nto any Humean account of laws. If the laws are nothing but generic\nfeatures of the Humean Mosaic, then there is a sense in which one\ncannot appeal to those very laws to explain the particular features of\nthe Mosaic itself: the laws are what they are in virtue of the Mosaic\nrather than vice versa (Maudlin 2007, 172).\n\n\nLoewer (2012, 131) offers a response to the issue\nthat Maudlin highlights. Loewer\u2019s response is that the\ngreat Humean mosaic makes the laws of nature true. The move he makes\nto avoid the circularity is that Humean laws do not\nmetaphysically explain elements of the mosaic, but they do\nscientifically explain aspects of the mosaic, suggesting that\nthere are two notions of explanation and so no circularity. This\nmove has spawned a recent slew of excellent journal articles regarding\nthe viability of Loewer\u2019s move (see especially Lange 2013,\nMiller 2015, Roski 2018, and Shumener 2017).\n\n\nAn increasingly popular way to look at the relation between laws and\ntheir instances is taking instances as grounding laws. No individual\ninstance of a law can fully ground the law, but a conjunction of\ninstances does more fully ground the law. Another plausible way of\nviewing the relation between laws and their instances is to see laws\nas grounding their instances (Emery 2019). Because the grounding\nrelation is non-symmetric, both of these views cannot be true. The way\nout of this dilemma is one that illuminates the debate about\nexplanation in an interesting way. Consider that while (P\n& Q) is a full ground for Q, it seems wrong to\nclaim that (P & Q) explains why Q\n(Roski 2018). This is because the content of the explanandum (what is\nto be explained) is embedded in the content of the explanans (what is\nintended to do the explaining), and something cannot explain itself\n(or be an essential part of an explanation of itself). Notice that\nthis formulation exposes the problem: if the explanans includes the\nexplanandum as part of its content, it makes the explanation devoid of\nunderstanding. Ones audience would have to already have had an\nunderstanding of the explanandum. Successful explanations are not\ncircular, so anyone taking laws as grounds for their instances ought\nnot to think that the grounding relation is explanatory. The point\nhere is not to show that grounding is not an explanatory relation, but\nrather to show that laws of nature are not suited to explain\ntheir instances. Circularity also infects the DN model of\nexplanations. As the authors of the DN model pointed out:\n\n\u2026 the content of the explanandum is contained in the\nexplanans. That is correct since the explanandum is a semantic\nconsequence of the explanans (Hempel and Oppenheim, cf. 1948, 162;\nalso see Shumener 2017, 793).\n\nThe issue here undermines the importance of the role for explanations\nto provide understanding. The required validity brings semantic\ncircularity, because the content of the explanans would then be\nsufficient for the truth of the explanandum. In line with the regular\npresentations of the DN model, at least one law of nature is required\nto be a premise in an \u201cexplanatory argument\u201d. Indeed, at\nleast one law needs to be essential to the validity of the argument,\nand the laws being part of the explanans are clearly a factor\nregarding the circularity. To add to these challenges, it is good\nto remember what Dretske pointed out regarding laws and\nexplanation.\n\n\nTo say that a law is a universal truth having explanatory power is\nlike saying a chair is a breath of air used to seat people. You cannot\nmake a silk purse out of a sow\u2019s ear, not even a very good\nsow\u2019s ear; and you cannot make a generalization, not even a\npurely universal generalization, explain its instances. The fact that\nevery F is G fails to explain why any F is G, and it fails to explain\nit, not because its explanatory efforts are too feeble to have\nattracted our attention, but because the explanatory attempt is never\neven made \u2026 Subsuming an instance under a universal\ngeneralization has exactly as much explanatory power as deriving Q\nfrom P & Q. None (1977, 26).\n\n\nDretske\u2019s reaction to this quotation was to conclude that\nlaws of nature are not universally quantified conditionals; that they\nare not mere generalizations. Instead, it was thought that laws\nhad to be a different kind of thing: a relation between universals,\nphysically necessary generalizations, or a true axiom or theorem of an\nideal system, or even a metaphysically necessary generalization. \nAnother approach needs to be considered, maybe, just maybe, laws of\nnature are generalizations and just aren\u2019t explanatory in any\nvery significant way. This is an approach that identifies what sort of\nentity a law of nature is.\n10. Physics and the Special Sciences\n\nTwo separate (but related) questions have received much recent\nattention in the philosophical literature surrounding laws. Neither\nhas much to do with what it is to be a law. Instead, they have to do\nwith the nature of the generalizations scientists try to discover.\nFirst: Does any science try to discover exceptionless regularities in\nits attempt to discover laws? Second: Even if one science \u2014\nfundamental physics \u2014 does, do others?\n10.1 Do Physicists try to discover Exceptionless Regularities?\n\nPhilosophers draw a distinction between strict\ngeneralizations and ceteris-paribus generalizations. The\ncontrast is supposed to be between universal generalizations of the\nsort discussed above (e.g., that all inertial bodies have no\nacceleration) and seemingly less formal generalizations like that,\nother things being equal, smoking causes cancer. The idea is that the\nformer would be contradicted by a single counterinstance, say, one\naccelerating inertial body, though the latter is consistent with there\nbeing one smoker who never gets cancer. Though in theory this\ndistinction is easy enough to understand, in practice it is often\ndifficult to distinguish strict from ceteris-paribus\ngeneralizations. This is because many philosophers think that many\nutterances which include no explicit ceteris-paribus clause\nimplicitly do include such a clause.\n\nFor the most part, philosophers have thought that if scientists have\ndiscovered any exceptionless regularities that are laws, they have\ndone so at the level of fundamental physics. A few philosophers,\nhowever, are doubtful that there are exceptionless regularities at\neven this basic level. For example, Cartwright has argued that\nthe descriptive and the explanatory aspects of laws conflict.\n\u201cRendered as descriptions of fact, they are false; amended to be\ntrue, they lose their fundamental explanatory force\u201d (1980, 75).\nConsider Newton\u2019s gravitational principle, F =\nGmm\u2032/r2.\nProperly understood, according to Cartwright, it says that for any two\nbodies the force between them is\nGmm\u2032/r2. But\nif that is what the law says then the law is not an exceptionless\nregularity. This is because the force between two bodies is influenced\nby other properties than just their mass and the distance between\nthem, by properties like the charge of the two bodies as described by\nCoulomb\u2019s law. The statement of the gravitational principle can\nbe amended to make it true, but that, according to Cartwright, at\nleast on certain standard ways of doing so, would strip it of its\nexplanatory power. For example, if the principle is taken to hold only\nthat F = Gmm\u2032/r2\nif there are no forces other than\ngravitational forces at work, then though it would be true it would\nnot apply except in idealized circumstances. Lange (1993) uses a\ndifferent example to make a similar point. Consider a standard\nexpression of the law of thermal expansion: \u2018Whenever the\ntemperature of a metal bar of length L0\nchanges by T, the length of the bar\nchanges by L = kL0T,\u2019\nwhere k is a\nconstant, the thermal expansion coefficient of the metal. If this\nexpression were used to express the strict generalization\nstraightforwardly suggested by its grammar, then such an utterance\nwould be false since the length of a bar does not change in the way\ndescribed in cases where someone is hammering on the ends of the bar.\nIt looks like the law will require provisos, but so many that the only\napparent way of taking into consideration all the required provisos\nwould be with something like a ceteris-paribus clause. Then\nthe concern becomes that the statement would be empty. Because of the\ndifficulty of stating plausible truth conditions for ceteris-paribus\nsentences, it is feared that \u2018Other things being equal,\nL = kL0T\u2019\ncould only mean\n\u2018L = kL0T\nprovided that L =\nkL0T.\u2019\n\nEven those who agree with the arguments of Cartwright and Lange\nsometimes disagree about what ultimately the arguments say about laws.\nCartwright believes that the true laws are not exceptionless\nregularities, but instead are statements that describe causal powers.\nSo construed, they turn out to be both true and explanatory. Lange\nends up holding that there are propositions properly adopted as laws,\nthough in doing so one need not also believe any exceptionless\nregularity; there need not be one. Giere (1999) can usefully be\ninterpreted as agreeing with Cartwright\u2019s basic arguments but\ninsisting that law-statements don\u2019t have implicit provisos or\nimplicit ceteris-paribus clauses. So, he concludes that there\nare no laws.\n\nEarman and Roberts hold that there are exceptionless and lawful\nregularities. More precisely, they argue that scientists doing\nfundamental physics do attempt to state strict generalizations that\nare such that they would be strict laws if they were true:\n\nOur claim is only that \u2026 typical theories from fundamental\nphysics are such that if they were true, there would be\nprecise proviso free laws. For example, Einstein\u2019s gravitational\nfield law asserts \u2014 without equivocation, qualification,\nproviso, ceteris paribus clause \u2014 that the Ricci\ncurvature tensor of spacetime is proportional to the total\nstress-energy tensor for matter-energy; the relativistic version of\nMaxwell\u2019s laws of electromagnetism for charge-free flat\nspacetime asserts \u2014 without qualification or proviso \u2014\nthat the curl of the E field is proportional to the\npartial time derivative, etc. (1999, 446).\n\n\nAbout Cartwright\u2019s gravitational example, they think (473, fn.\n14) that a plausible understanding of the gravitational principle is\nas describing only the gravitational force between the two\nmassive bodies. (Cartwright argues that there is no such component\nforce and so thinks such an interpretation would be false. Earman and\nRoberts disagree.) About Lange\u2019s example, they think the law\nshould be understood as having the single proviso that there be no\nexternal stresses on the metal bar (461). In any case, much more would\nneed to be said to establish that all the apparently strict\nand explanatory generalizations that have been or will be stated by\nphysicists have turned or will turn out to be false. (Earman, et\nal., 2003 includes more recent papers by both Cartwright and\nLange, and also many other papers on ceteris-paribus\nlaws.)\n10.2 Could there be any Special-Science Laws?\n\nSupposing that physicists do try to discover exceptionless\nregularities, and even supposing that our physicists will sometimes be\nsuccessful, there is a further question of whether it is a goal of any\nscience other than fundamental physics \u2014 any so-called special\nscience \u2014 to discover exceptionless regularities and whether\nthese scientists have any hope of succeeding. Consider an economic law\nof supply and demand that says that, when demand increases and supply\nis held fixed, price increases. Notice that, in some places, the price\nof gasoline has sometimes remained the same despite an increase in\ndemand and a fixed supply, because the price of gasoline was\ngovernment regulated. It appears that the law has to be understood as\nhaving a ceteris-paribus clause in order for it to be true. This\nproblem is a very general one. As Jerry Fodor (1989, 78) has pointed\nout, in virtue of being stated in a vocabulary of a special science,\nit is very likely that there will be limiting conditions \u2014\nespecially underlying physical conditions \u2014 that will undermine\nany interesting strict generalization of the special sciences,\nconditions that themselves could not be described in the\nspecial-science vocabulary. Donald Davidson prompted much of the\nrecent interest in special-science laws with his \u201cMental\nEvents\u201d (1980 [f.p. 1970], 207\u2013225). He gave an argument\nspecifically directed against the possibility of strict\npsycho-physical laws. More importantly, he made the suggestion that\nthe absence of such laws may be relevant to whether mental events ever\ncause physical events. This prompted a slew of papers dealing with the\nproblem of reconciling the absence of strict special-science laws with\nthe reality of mental causation (e.g., Loewer and Lepore 1987 and\n1989, Fodor 1989, Schiffer 1991, Pietroski and Rey 1995).\n\nProgress on the problem of provisos depends on three basic issues\nbeing distinguished. First, there is the question of what it is to be\na law, which in essence is the search for a necessarily true\ncompletion of: \u201cP is a law if and only if\n\u2026\u201d. Obviously, to be a true completion, it must hold for\nall P, whether P is a strict generalization or a\nceteris-paribus one. Second, there is also a need to\ndetermine the truth conditions of the generalization sentences used by\nscientists. Third, there is the a posteriori and scientific\nquestion of which generalizations expressed by the sentences used by\nthe scientists are true. The second of these issues is the one where\nthe action needs to be.\n\nOn this score, it is striking how little attention is given to the\npossible effects of context. Mightn\u2019t it be that, when the\neconomist utters a certain strict generalization sentence in an\n\u201ceconomic setting\u201d (say, in an economics textbook or at an\neconomics conference), context-sensitive considerations affecting its\ntruth conditions will have it turn out that the utterance is true?\nThis might be the case despite the fact that the same sentence uttered\nin a different context (say, in a discussion among fundamental\nphysicists or better yet in a philosophical discussion of laws) would\nresult in a clearly false utterance. These changing truth conditions\nmight be the result of something as plain as a contextual shift in the\ndomain of quantification or perhaps something less obvious. Whatever\nit is, the important point is that this shift could be a function of\nnothing more than the linguistic meaning of the sentence and familiar\nrules of interpretation (e.g., the rule of accommodation).\n\nConsider a situation where an engineering professor utters,\n\u201cWhen a metal bar is heated, the change in its length is\nproportional to the change in its temperature\u201d and suppose a\nstudent offers, \u201cNot when someone is hammering on both ends of\nthe bar.\u201d Has the student shown that the teacher\u2019s\nutterance was false? Maybe not. Notice that the student comes off\nsounding a bit insolent. In all likelihood, such an unusual situation\nas someone hammering on both ends of a heated bar would not have been\nin play when the professor said what he did. In fact, the reason the\nstudent comes off sounding insolent is because it seems that he should\nhave known that his example was irrelevant. Notice that the\nprofessor\u2019s sentence needn\u2019t include some implicit\nceteris-paribus clause in order for his utterance to be true;\nas this example illustrates, in ordinary conversations, plain old\nstrict generalization sentences are not always used to cover the full\nrange of actual cases. Indeed, they are rarely used in this way. If\nspecial scientists do make true utterances of generalization sentences\n(sometimes ceteris-paribus generalization sentences,\nsometimes not), then apparently nothing stands in the way of them\nuttering true special-science lawhood sentences. The issue here has\nbeen the truth of special-science generalizations, not any other\nrequirements of lawhood.\n11. Concluding Remarks: What is Next?\n\nHow will matters progress? How can philosophy advance beyond the\ncurrent disputes about laws of nature? Three issues are\nespecially interesting and important ones. The first concerns\nwhether lawhood is a part of the content of scientific theories. This\nis a question often asked about causation, but less frequently\naddressed about lawhood. Roberts offers an analogy in support of the\nthought that it is not: It is a postulate of Euclidean geometry that\ntwo points determine a line. But it is not part of the content of\nEuclidean geometry that this proposition is a postulate. Euclidean\ngeometry is not a theory about postulates; it is a theory about\npoints, lines, and planes \u2026 (2008, 92). This may be a\nplausible first step toward understanding the absence  of some\nnomic terms from formal statements of scientific theories. The\nsecond issue is whether there are any contingent laws of nature.\nNecessitarians continue to work on filling in their view, while\nHumeans and others pay relatively little attention to what they are up\nto; new work needs to explain the source of the underlying commitments\nthat divide these camps.  Finally, more attention needs to be\npaid to the language used to report what are the laws and the language\nused to express the laws themselves and whether the laws\nexplain. It is clear that recent disputes about generalizations\nin physics and the special sciences turn on precisely these matters,\nbut exploring them may also pay dividends on central matters regarding\nontology, realism vs. antirealism, and supervenience.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armstrong, D., 1978, <em>A Theory of Universals</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1983, <em>What Is a Law of Nature?</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1991, \u201cWhat Makes Induction\nRational?,\u201d <em>Dialogue</em>, 30: 503\u2013511.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1993, \u201cThe Identification Problem and\nthe Inference Problem,\u201d <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological\nResearch</em>, 53: 421\u2013422.", "Beebee, H., 2000, \u201cThe Nongoverning Conception of Laws of\nNature,\u201d <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, 61:\n571\u2013594.", "Berenstain, N. and Ladyman, J., 2012, \u201cOntic Structural\nRealism and Modality,\u201d in E.
