    "main_text": "Being and Partaking\n8. Being and Partaking\n\n\nThe rigid separation of Forms from sensible particulars, Plato's\nidea that there are \u2018Two Worlds\u2019, is embodied in Plato's\nisolation of the two ways of being, Being and Partaking. The criteria\nand the properties which differentiate Forms and particulars are\nrelated to their respective ways of being, but mutability,\nextendedness, etc., are not equivalent to Partaking and they do not\nexplain it nor are they explained by it. Still, the deficiency of the\nsensible is aptly viewed in terms of its way of being, i.e., in virtue\nof the fact that every sensible acquires all of its properties through\nparticipation. The deficiency of the sensible is its deficient way\nof being. Lacking any essence, it can only fail to Be.\n\n\nThis notion of deficiency has a long pedigree. In one sense it is a\nnew way of cashing out the idea that Forms and particulars are\ndifferent kinds or types of\n entities.[17]\n It clearly is not an\nApproximation view or a view according to which Forms are treated as\nparadigmatic particulars. The very same property, Beauty, is related,\nvia Being, to the Form Beauty Itself that is related to the sensible\nparticular via Partaking. The beauty of Helen is not itself deficient,\nher way of having it is. And since beauty does not characterize Beauty,\nthere is no case to be made that Beauty Itself could be a\nparadigmatically beautiful object. It would appear, then, that only\nForms are definable, since essence is not predicated of particulars.\nBut it is not so simple. Based on the Phaedo's account of\nBeing and Participating (cf. Principles I and II, supra), we\ncan conclude that:\n\nEach Form, F, Is its essence,\nY.\n\n\nand that\n\nFor all particulars, P, and for all properties\nY, if Y is predicated (able) of P, then\nP Has Y.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, since the Phaedo asserts that particulars are\nwhat they are in virtue of the Form's being what it Is, it follows\nthat\n\nIf P has Y, then P has something\nwhich Is Y.\n\n\n\nThe motivation for this claim is our understanding of the thesis at\n100c that Beauty Itself alone Is beautiful and that other things\nacquire their beauty in virtue of partaking in what Is beautiful. The\ntraditional and obvious way to parse this claim is to allow that it is\nthe Form Itself which the particular has, for it seems that only the\nForm whose essence is Y, Is Y. But if this is true,\nthen if, as the Identity view maintains, the Form and its essence are\nidentical, it follows that the essence must also be predicable of\nthe particular. In which case it seems that the particulars do\nhave essences, albeit via Partaking, for they have something which is\nidentical with an essence.\n\n\nForm-copies, the-large-in-Socrates, the hot-in-fire, and such,\nprovide a way out of this predicament. There is no consensus as to\nwhether they are bona fide members of the ontology of the\nPhaedo (102bff). Many have argued that the so-called\nform-copies are nothing more than the Forms conceived of as inherent\nin, or immanent in, particulars, the particularization of the Form, or\nForms as they function in the participation\n relation.[18]\n But if Plato wishes to avoid the consequence of predicating Forms and,\nthus, essences directly of particulars, then there is a compelling\nreason for him to admit form-copies into his ontology. They differ\nfrom their parent Form in that they are singular or unit-properties,\nwhereas the Form is general and abstract.\n\n\nThe relation of the form-copy to the particular is a real problem.\nThe crucial issue is whether form-copies are dependent on particulars,\nespecially whether their claim to be individual or unit-properties is\nonly as good as the company they keep. Part of the difficulty results\nfrom the metaphor Plato's uses throughout the last stage of the Final\nArgument in the Phaedo. In anticipation of what will be his\nultimate \u2018proof\u2019 of the immortality of the soul, Plato\ncontends that when something possessed of an essential property, as for\ninstance snow possesses cold, is confronted by the\n\u2018opposite\u2019, heat, then the-cold-in-the snow must withdraw\nor perish. (The soul, because it cannot perish, must therefore\nwithdraw.) Which of the two possibilities developed in the military\nmetaphor does Plato envisage for form-copies: do they \u2018withdraw\nor perish\u2019? It is a struggle to understand just what the military\nmetaphors amount to, but if the form-copies perish at the approach of\ntheir opposite, this suggests that form-copies are dependent on the\nparticulars to which they\n belong.[19]\n Those who deny that form-copies are bona fide beings cite\ntheir perishing as a principal reason to take them as nothing more\nthan a metaphor for the particular's (temporary) participation in the\nForm. Conversely, if they are able to withdraw, they are in some sense\nindependent from the particulars. In this fashion they are akin to\nindividual souls, since neither souls nor form-copies will be\ndependent for their existence on the particular to which they\ntemporarily belong.\n\n\nBut even if they withdraw and thus exist apart from the particulars,\ntheir individuality seems to be determined by the company they keep,\ne.g., Socrates, or this bit of snow.\n\u2018Belonging-to-Socrates\u2019 is a relational property and seems\nto require that there be something, namely Socrates, to which the\nform-copy can belong. However, if form-copies are thus dependent on\nparticulars, there is a problem with respect to the nature of\nparticulars lurking in the Phaedo. For it seems that\nparticulars have all of their properties in virtue of participating in\nthe relevant Forms. Particulars, then, are ultimately to be identified\nin terms of the properties they have, namely their form-copies. But if\nthese form-copies, in turn, are themselves individuated by the\nparticulars whose form-copies they are, we are confronted with a\ncircle.\n\n\nPlato may be able to avoid this circle of individuation by not\nmaking form-copies depend on particulars for either their being or\ntheir individuation. If their status as individuals is primitive,\nform-copies will not be individuated by the particulars to which they\nbelong. In this respect they are like the individual souls, which,\nsince they pre-exist and postdate the particulars they inhabit, are not\nand cannot be individuated by them. A form-copy is, in the strict\nsense, a simple individual, incapable of possessing anything besides\n(the essence of) the Form of which it is a copy. Finally, they are not\ndependent on particulars, even for their individuation, because they\ncan withdraw when necessary and thus continue to be what they are when\nthe particular has perished. They can be said to perish, but\nonly in the sense that the particular to which they temporarily attach\ncan itself perish or change. (Were they dependent on the particular,\nform-copies would in fact perish.) The reason they survive is that a\nform-copy Is what it is. In so far as anything Is what it is, it cannot\ncease to be, i.e., cease to be what it Is. In this respect, too, they\nare like souls. Both souls and form-copies are then individuals in\ntheir own rights, apart from any particulars in which they inhere.\n\n\nForm-copies belong to particulars and derive or emanate, to borrow a\nneo-Platonic term, from Forms. Form-copies allow Plato to respond to a\nthreat posed by the metaphysics of Forms: to wit, that particulars\nmight be indiscernible. If particulars are nothing in their own right,\nand in the absence of both matter and form-copies, then particulars are\nmerely bundles of\n Forms;[20]\n but if they are bundles, then two particulars composed of the same\nForms would be indiscernible and identical. If we admit form-copies,\nparticulars are not bundles of Forms. Particulars will be bundles of\nform-copies. And unlike a Form, which would seem to have to be\nnumerically the same in each particular, the form-copies will differ\nfrom one another since they are distinct individual\nproperty-instances, not universals. However, while the particulars are\nno longer identical, this still allows that two bundles of\nform-copies could be indiscernible, since the form-copies of\nany one Form differ, it seems, solo numero. Helen's form-copy\nof Beauty cannot differ in quality from Andromache's, but their\nform-copies are distinct. If we allow that Helen and Andromache are\npresumed to be distinct particulars in virtue of their matter, we can\nfurther distinguish the particulars and the form-copies, i.e.\nthe-beautiful-in-Helen versus the beautiful-in-Andromache. Here again,\nthen, the assumption of the material particular is relevant. When\nPlato recognizes that he has yet to account for matter, and thus the\nindividuation of particulars, he has to compose the\nTimaeus.\n\n\nParticulars, then, have the properties they have because they have\nForm-copies derived from the Forms, which Are those properties. And\nwhen they inhere in the material particular, the particular has a\ndefinite, determinate property instance of Largeness or Beauty. The\nparticular is assumed to be a combination of matter and form-copies\n(and in some cases, soul). All the form-copies can be lost, for the\nparticular has no essential properties or essence, and so too the soul\ncan be lost. In fact, since Plato seems to think that the body also\ndissipates, the particular can totally disappear. Not so the Form,\nwhich Is what it is, an auto kath auto being, precisely in\nthat its essence is predicated via Being of it, and it is the only Form\nof which that essence is predicated.\n\n\nA particular, x, is what it is in virtue of Partaking. What\nmakes x beautiful, for instance, is its having something which\nIs beautiful. This something can either be a Form or form-copy, for\nthese alone Are beautiful. It might seem, however, that the qualitative\naspect of property possession is being explained in terms of items that\nare not qualified or characterized in the appropriate manner. This\nwould be the result were Partaking analyzed in terms of, or reduced to,\nthe relationship of Being. But in the middle period at least, Partaking\nis itself a primitive relation alongside Being. Moreover, at this\njuncture the participating subject is assumed to be a material\nparticular, whose material nature goes without analysis. The primitive\nrelation of Partaking, along with the effects of matter, are thus\nresponsible for the characterization of the particulars: in virtue of\nhaving something, which Is beautiful, Helen is a beautiful\nwoman. The form-copy is not responsible for the concrete, determinate\ncharacter of her beauty. Her being a material object, and her\nhaving of the form-copy cause her to be so characterized. That\nher determinate character is the character of Beauty, on the\nother hand, is due to the form-copy that she has, and this form-copy,\nin turn, causes her to be beautiful in virtue of being a form-copy of\nBeauty Itself. In this respect, Plato sustains the Socratic notion that\nForms are logical causes. The Form, Beauty Itself, makes possible the\nfact that Helen is beautiful, in so far as a form-copy of Beauty is\nsomething she has. Since she has all of her properties in this fashion,\nand since we seem to be able to identify her, and any particular, only\nthrough descriptions that refer to her properties, form-copies and\ntheir respective Forms are responsible for our epistemic access to\n particulars.[21]\n",
