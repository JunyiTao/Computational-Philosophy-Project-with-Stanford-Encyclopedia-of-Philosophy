Unlike Buddhism which ultimately hailed\nfrom India, Confucianism was first and foremost a distinctly Chinese\nteaching. It spread, however, from Han dynasty China, into Korea, and\nthen later entered Japan via, for the most part, the Korean peninsula.\nIn significant respects, then, Confucianism defines much of the East\nAsian identity of Japan, especially in relation to philosophical\nthought and practice.\n\nWhile there is a religious dimension to Confucianism, its\nteachings \u2013 ethical, epistemological, metaphysical, political, and\naesthetic \u2013 are typically understood in relation to the\nsocio-political world of humanity, beginning with the individual and\nhis/her pursuit of moral and intellectual perfection, the family and\nits pursuit of harmony and order, and the polity and its pursuit of\npeace and prosperity throughout all below heaven, i.e., the world at\nlarge. In this respect, Confucianism was the secular philosophy\noperative in the ordinary world of everyday existence, at one level or\nanother, throughout Japanese history, well into modern times. As often\nas not, however, its teachings have become so\nthoroughly integrated into Japanese culture without being\nexplicitly identified as \u201cConfucian\u201d that many have\nnaively assumed them simply generic to the Japanese mind and its\nmyriad expressions in history and culture.\n\nViewed as a religio-philosophical teaching, Confucianism brims with\nhigh-minded ideals that have always challenged humanity to realize the\nhighest state of ethical perfection and self-realization. However, as\na political doctrine appropriated by the ruling elite to provide a\nmodicum of legitimization for coercive rule, Confucianism was often\nvoiced in cynical if not self-serving ways, belying the very ideals to\nwhich little more than lip-service was otherwise given. However, from\nthe beginnings of political unity in Japan as provided by the nascent\nimperial system and then later by various shogunal regimes, Confucian\nthinking informed the ethics and socio-political ideals of the polity,\nand not infrequently imperial names and reign names, thus defining the\nparameters of real world discourse about the governed, those\ngoverning, and the nature and purpose of government. In modern times,\never resilient Confucian notions have provided conceptual foundations\nfor integrating much of western thinking about self, society, the\nfamily, and the polity, thus helping to mediate Japan\u2019s advance,\nphilosophically, toward a more global understanding of civilization\nand modernity.\n\nHere, rather than trace the historical vicissitudes of Confucianism in\nJapanese culture, or explore the thinking of individual scholars,\nConfucianism will be approached as a systematic conceptual discourse\ndefining the contours, philosophically, of much that was said and\nthought about the everyday world of common sense reality. In\nparticular, the focus is on Confucian thinking about language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, the mind, political theory,\neducation, spirituality, and the environment. In this way, the\nfoundations of Confucianism as intellectual discourse are hopefully\nlaid bare.\n", "toc": [{"#ProlNameReal": "Prolegomenon: Names and Realities"}, {"#OrigVariConfPhil": "1.

Prolegomenon: Names and Realities\n\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d is a term used by westerners to refer to a\ndiverse set of philosophical movements that have been variously known\nin Japanese as Jugaku (the learning of the scholars),\nJuky\u014d (the teachings of the scholars), seigaku\n(the learning of the sages), seirigaku (the learning of human\nnature and principle), rigaku (the learning related to\nprinciple), and shingaku (the learning of the mind). There\nwas no single word in the traditional East Asian lexicon that\ncorresponded exactly and consistently to \u201cConfucianism,\u201d\nyet by late-medieval and early-modern times, there was a fairly\ndistinct understanding among Japanese intellectuals of an essential\nunity to the diverse Confucian teachings otherwise variously referred\nto. This is clear in references to the \u201cthree teachings\u201d,\nConfucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism (and/or Shint\u014d). One of many\nexamples is Matsunaga Sekigo\u2019s (1592\u20131657)\nIrinsh\u014d (Selected Writings on Ethics, 1640),\nwhich opens by stating, \u201cBetween heaven and earth, there are\nthree major ways: the Confucian, which is the way of Confucius; the\nBuddhist, which is the way of Shakyamuni; and the Daoist, which is the\nway of Laozi.\u201d\n\nThe most commonly used references to Confucianism in Japanese history,\ntraditional and modern, are the terms Jugaku and\nJuky\u014d. In these, Ju is the Japanese reading of\nthe Chinese word Ru, literally referring to\n\u201cweaklings.\u201d The latter was a reference to scholars who\ntended to work with their minds rather than their bodies and were, as\na result, perceived as being weaker. The term was used by later\nscholars in explaining the teachings of Confucius (551\u2013479\nB.C.E.). Acceptance of the term partly reflected Confucius\u2019\ndistaste for coercive force as opposed to the softer power of ethical\nexamples and the allegedly irresistible efficacy of moral suasion.\n\nIn the west, the term \u201cConfucianism\u201d first came into use\nfollowing contacts between Jesuit missionaries and Chinese scholars.\nThe Jesuit term \u201cConfucianism\u201d is a Latinized version of\nthe honorific reference to the great sage of China, Kong Fuzi. Minus\nthe honorific fuzi, Confucius\u2019 name was Kong Qiu. The\nrelatively recent origins of the western term should not obscure the\nfact that there had long before developed, among East Asian\nintellectuals, an understanding of Confucianism expressed not through\na root reference to the founder Confucius, but instead to those who\nfollowed his teachings, the Ju, or scholars.\n\nViewing Confucianism as \u201cphilosophy\u201d began, in western\nstudies, with the Jesuit anthology, Confucius Sinarum\nPhilosophus (Confucius, China\u2019s Philosopher),\npublished in Paris in 1687 and dedicated to King Louis XIV. This work\nintroduced Confucius\u2019 thought with high praise and selected\ntranslations from the Great Learning, the Analects,\nand the Doctrine of the Mean. Originally published in Latin,\nConfucius Sinarum Philosophus was soon translated into\nFrench, German, and English. It influenced early admirers of\nConfucianism and Chinese philosophy, as it quickly came to be known,\nincluding Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716) and Voltaire\n(1694\u20131778). The anthology was also known to those who later\ndisparaged Confucianism, including G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831)\nwho remarked that Confucius\u2019 reputation would have been enhanced\nhad his works never been translated. Regardless, Hegel never flatly\ndenied that Confucian thinking merited consideration as\n\u201cphilosophy,\u201d even though he did not regard it highly.\n\nIn this article, the term \u201cConfucian\u201d is used in reference\nto things (people, practices, discussions, texts, etc.) that derive\nfrom or relate directly to the Analects, as well as other\nworks of ancient literature associated with the Analects and\nConfucius. The five classics of ancient China \u2013 including the\nBook of History, the Book of Changes, the Book\nof Poetry, the Book of Rites, and the Spring and\nAutumn Annals \u2013 are here considered as Confucian classics\nbecause they were, for the most part, thought to have been edited by\nConfucius. While modern scholars might well doubt that claim, most\nscholars in Chinese and East Asian history accepted the traditional\naccounts crediting Confucius\u2019 editorship. The term\n\u201cNeo-Confucian\u201d refers to thinkers, ideas, texts,\npractices, and institutions that developed out of Confucian traditions\nas they were reinterpreted in the wake of Chinese and East Asian\nencounters with Buddhism. The term \u201cConfucian\u201d could\nequally apply to Neo-Confucians for simplicity\u2019s sake, though\ndifferences between Confucian and Neo-Confucian teachings are\nsufficiently substantial to merit the distinction between the two\ngroups.\n\nUnderstood most comprehensively, the importance of Confucianism in\nJapanese history is undeniable: as in China and Korea, Confucian\nphilosophizing in Japan came to define one major if not dominant layer\nof the early-modern and modern worldviews. Its lexicographic legacy is\nomnipresent in modern Japanese discourse, with Confucian terms playing\nnew roles in discourses ranging from modern philosophy to science,\nreligion, the humanities and the social sciences. One indication of\nthe importance of Confucianism to Japan today is that the modern word\nfor \u201cuniversity\u201d (J: daigaku; C: Daxue)\nis taken from the title of the first of the four books of\nNeo-Confucianism, the Daxue (The Great Learning; J:\nDaigaku), a text that was understood as the gateway to\nlearning for adults. This legacy, incidentally, is one that originated\nin Japan, with the founding of Tokyo Imperial University and a number\nof other imperial universities including Kyoto Imperial University,\nbut soon spread throughout East Asia. The acceptance of this\ndesignation signaled the consensus among East Asian statesmen and\nintellectuals regarding the significance of Confucianism for the\nadvanced educational values of the region as well as the multifaceted\nlexicon of Confucianism as the most apt for conceptualizing and\nultimately translating modernity.\n\nHegel\u2019s view that the history of philosophy\nencompassed Asian philosophy including Chinese philosophy, with\nConfucius as the prime representative of the latter, influenced the\nfirst definition of \u201cJapanese philosophy\u201d and\n\u201cJapanese Confucian philosophy.\u201d Between 1884 and 1890,\nInoue Tetsujir\u014d (1855\u20131944), studied in Heidelberg and\nLeipzig, focusing on German Idealism and Hegel. A decade after his\nreturn to Japan and appointment as the first Japanese professor of\nphilosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, Inoue began publishing his\nmonumental three-volume account of Japanese Confucian philosophy, the\nPhilosophy of the Japanese School of Wang Yangming (Nihon\nY\u014dmeigakuha no tetsugaku, 1900), the Philosophy of the\nJapanese School of Ancient Learning (Nihon kogakuha no\ntetsugaku, 1902), and the Philosophy of the Japanese School\nof Zhu Xi (Nihon Shushigakuha no tetsugaku, 1905).\nStanding as Hegel\u2019s antithesis, Inoue presented a detailed and\nfairly positive account of Japanese Confucian philosophy. In\ndoing so, Inoue suggested that well before the introduction of western\nphilosophy, Japan had developed a substantial philosophical tradition\nof its own, one that in terms of volume and diversity compared\nimpressively with any national tradition of philosophy in the\nwest.\n\nAlthough overtly nationalistic and so not always cited in contemporary\nscholarship on the history of philosophy in Japan, Inoue\u2019s\ntrilogy remains the first extended statement of what Japanese\nphilosophical thought consisted of. Its descriptions of Confucian\nthinking as philosophical in nature decisively impacted later East\nAsian estimations of Confucianism. Even as Inoue elevated Japanese\nConfucian thinking as philosophical, late-Qing China abandoned its\ncivil service examination system which for over five centuries had\ntested one\u2019s mastery of Confucian texts. That Chinese thinkers\ndid later recognize value in Confucianism as the most compelling\nstatement of traditional Chinese philosophy owed much, ironically\nenough, to Inoue\u2019s earlier vision of the role of Japanese\nConfucianism in the philosophical development, prior to western\ncontact, of Japan. It is no exaggeration to say that the study of\nJapanese Confucianism as philosophy began with Inoue\u2019s\ntrilogy.\n\nMany western scholars distinguish Confucianism from\nNeo-Confucianism. As an interpretive category, Neo-Confucianism has a\nvariety of nuances but most scholars who use the term do so in\nreference to forms of Confucian philosophizing that emerged in the\nwake of Buddhism. Many philosophical positions that Buddhism\nendorsed had not been well addressed by earlier Confucian\nphilosophers. For example, Buddhists often affirmed that\nmetaphysically all things are empty of self-substantial being. Along\nsimilar lines, Buddhists offered a psychology of introspection\nclaiming that the reality constructed by ordinary experience is\npermeated with delusions arising from egocentrism and ignorance. As\nsuch, the reality of common sense is the realm of suffering. Early\nConfucians had not typically discussed metaphysics, apparently\nthinking that common sense assumptions about the reality of this world\nwere not in question. As Buddhist estimations of reality gained a\ngreater hearing, Confucians formulated a metaphysics affirming the\nreality of the world of ordinary experience, explaining the\nsubstantial nature of the world by way of the notion of ki, a\nterm indicating the generative force that is the transformative stuff\nof all that exists in an unending process of becoming. In positing\nthis metaphysics of ki along with various other ideas related\nto ethics, politics, spirituality, and humanity, Confucian scholars\nexpanded upon the basics of early Confucian thinking so much so that\nmany modern interpreters have referred to them as\n\u201cNeo-Confucians.\u201d\n2. Origins and Varieties of Confucian Philosophy\n\nConfucianism began with the teachings of Confucius, despite the fact\nthat Confucius in no way saw himself as founding a school of\nphilosophy. Arguably his foremost concern was to effect a restoration\nof the kind of socio-political order that had prevailed, at least in\nhis mind, at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty (1027\u2013256\nB.C.E.). In search of a position of influence that would enable him to\ncontribute to a return to such order, Confucius traveled from realm to\nrealm within the Zhou kingdom, hoping that his ideas about how\ngovernment and society ought to be aligned would find an enthusiastic\npatron. Although Confucius never succeeded in this, along the way a\ngroup of interested students came to associate themselves with him.\nFor his followers Confucius appears to have emerged as much as a\nteacher as a political figure. While Confucius never wrote any\nindependent treatises or dialogues that were meant to serve as\nsystematic expressions of his personal ideas, over time reports about\nhis discussions with his disciples came to be recorded and edited into\na work most commonly translated as the Analects. Some\nscholars have long questioned the extent to which the\nAnalects actually represents a true and consistent expression\nof Confucius\u2019 thought. Nevertheless, the text has been accepted\n(perhaps naively) by sufficient numbers of followers over the\ncenturies to make it, whether authentic or not, a work that must be\nread and understood by anyone hoping to develop more than a\nsuperficial appreciation of what have been received as\nConfucius\u2019 teachings.\n\nConfucius set in motion the project of philosophy as a search for and\nlove of wisdom in ancient China. Shortly after his passing, around 500\nB.C.E., a variety of philosophical teachings emerged, including those\nassociated with Daoism, Mohism, and Legalism. So many were the\nphilosophical positions that commentators of the time noted, with\nhyperbole, that a \u201chundred schools of thought\u201d had\nappeared. Each of these new developments in classical philosophy,\nwhich interestingly enough appeared at about the same time as did the\nideas of the ancient Greek philosophers, emerged at least in part as a\npointed critique of the ideas associated with Confucius.\n\nThe most original philosophical notion attributed to Confucius was,\nfirst and foremost, that of humaneness (C: ren; J:\njin). Though never so much clearly and concisely explained as\nit was discussed and explored, the Analects suggests that the\npractice of humaneness consists in not treating others in a way that\none would not want to be treated. Not surprisingly, this notion has\nbeen characterized as the Confucian \u201cgolden rule,\u201d and\nlikened as well to Kant\u2019s categorical imperative calling on\npeople to act according to rules that they would be willing to deem\nuniversal laws. The Analects situates humaneness at the\ncenter of its moral philosophy, emphasizing it as the most universal\nethical notion. Indicative of that quintessential nature, almost all\nthinkers in East Asian history who could in any way be considered\n\u201cConfucian\u201d had to address it in their own writings.\n\nEqually significant in the Analects is the notion of the\njunzi (Japanese: kunshi), or the\n\u201cprince.\u201d The term literally refers to the \u201cson of a\nruler,\u201d but the Analects emphasizes that anyone who\ncultivates himself to the extent that his virtue is worthy of a prince\nis indeed a \u201cprince.\u201d Conversely, it makes clear that\nthose born to high standing who do not cultivate their virtue are not\nworthy of being deemed a prince. In effect, by developing this notion,\nthe Analects was outlining an ethical perspective whereby\neven the highest levels of the socio-political hierarchy could be\ncritically assessed.\n\nPolitically, the Analects suggests that rule by moral example\nis far more effective than rule by law and the threat of punishment.\nThe latter might elicit compliance, but not a sense of moral\nconscience. Rule by virtue, on the other hand, not only brings forth\ncompliance when the coercive power of the ruler is manifest, but also\nwhen it is not. Confucius also emphasized the primary importance of\nlanguage and its correct use for rightly governing the realm. In one\npassage, Confucius suggests that making sure language and words are\nused correctly is the first step to good government (13/3). Without\ndenying the importance of rule by law, Confucius rejected\nnarrow-minded legalism. At one point, the Analects (13/18)\neven portrays Confucius as affirming that it would be right for a\nfather to conceal the crimes of a son rather than turn him over to the\nauthorities. The Analects hardly meant to endorse evasion so\nmuch as the responsibility of family members to take care of their\nkin.\n\nThe Analects is also well known for what it does not discuss:\nmetaphysics and spiritual matters. In particular, Confucius is known\nfor asking students who wanted to hear about spiritual matters why\nthey were interested in such topics when they had yet to master the\nmoral way of humanity. In another context, the Analects\nsuggests that Confucius revered spirits, even while keeping his\ndistance from them. These passages imply that Confucius was not so\nmuch uninterested in metaphysical issues as he was in what he\nconsidered to be more fundamental and practical moral teachings.\n\nConfucius\u2019 teachings were advanced by various disciples in the\nlate-Zhou period, the most systematic being Mengzi (371\u2013289\nB.C.E.), known most commonly in the west by his Latinized name,\nMencius. A text by the same name conveys Mencius\u2019 most important\nelaborations of Confucian philosophy. Undoubtedly the most significant\ncontribution Mencius made to Confucian thought was his unequivocal\naffirmation that human nature is, at birth, good. Confucius had\nobserved that people are alike by birth, but differ in practice.\nHowever, it was not entirely clear how or in what sense people were\nactually alike. Mencius argued for the inborn goodness of humanity,\nnoting how that goodness issued naturally from a mind endowed with the\nbeginnings of humaneness, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Yet,\nMencius also acknowledged that evil, all too evident in the world,\nresulted when people abandoned the beginnings of goodness they were\nborn with. The project of Confucian learning as Mencius described it\nwas to maintain this mind of goodness and recover it if\nlost. This Mencian view of the inherent goodness of human nature\nwon out over the opposing view of his influential Confucian\ncontemporary Xunzi. (See entry on \u201cXunzi,\u201d Sect 2).\n\nPolitically, Mencius defined a more aggressive and confrontational\napproach than evident in the Analects. In one passage,\nMencius suggests that when a ruler forsakes ethical behavior and\nengages in extreme misrule, he can and should be removed, even\nexecuted, without such amounting to regicide. According to Mencius,\none who claims to be a ruler but in fact engages in extreme\nmisrule forfeits any claims to being a true, legitimate\nruler, and is nothing more than a common criminal who may rightly be\nexecuted for his crimes. In another instance, Mencius defines a more\npeople-centered understanding of legitimacy, suggesting that crucial\nto acquiring legitimate rule is the ability to win the\nhearts-and-minds of the people. Without that, a ruler might never hope\nfor success. Equally important was Mencius\u2019 affirmation that\nlegitimate government consists of ethical, humane government, or\nrenzheng (J: jinsei).\n\nConfucius was credited, according to traditional accounts, with\nediting the various classics of ancient Chinese writing that\nsupposedly existed prior to his day. While there might be some truth\nto this attribution, the classics that were known to Chinese history\nhave been shown to derive, as a matter of textual fact, from the\nearly-Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.). These classics, often\nreferred to as six in number, only consisted of some five books by Han\ntimes: the Book of Changes (Yijing); the Book of\nHistory (Shujing); the Book of Poetry\n(Shijing); the Book of Rites (Liji); the\nSpring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu). Whatever the\ntruth of the matter, it was widely believed among later Confucians\nthat the classics they studied had been in part edited by Confucius\nand so, in subtle ways, conveyed his understandings of history,\nliterature, etiquette, and even change itself. In the Han dynasty,\nthese texts came to be studied widely as part of the expanding\n\u201cConfucian\u201d curriculum. After a brief but brutal\npersecution of Confucian scholars and Confucian literature during the\nQin dynasty (221\u2013206 B.C.E.), Confucius began to emerge, during\nthe Han dynasty, as the much exalted and revered sage-philosopher of\nChina, and Confucians as a more distinctly identifiable group of\nscholars.\n\nIt was also in the Han that another philosophical system, that of\nBuddhism, entered China. Following the fall of the Han, Buddhism\ngradually expanded, often in association with the ruling power of\nnon-Chinese elites. While a conspicuous presence during the Sui and\nmost of the Tang dynasties, Buddhism eventually fell victim to\nimperial persecution at the highest level and widespread ethnocentric\nreactions issuing from an increasing consciousness of the foreign\nnature of the teachings. In tandem with the reaction against Buddhism\nand all of its philosophical claims, Confucian teachings were\nvariously reasserted. In many cases, these reassertions of\nConfucianism were made along such distinctively novel lines that\nwestern scholars have referred to them as expressions of Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy. The term does have its counterparts in East Asian\ndiscourse in the form of designations such as Songxue,\n\u201cthe learning of the Song dynasty,\u201d xinglixue,\n\u201cthe learning of human nature and principle,\u201d\nxinxue, \u201cthe learning of the mind,\u201d and\nlixue, \u201cthe learning of principle.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly the newest thing about Neo-Confucianism was its\nmetaphysics: while Confucius and Mencius had apparently assumed the\nreality of the world, they had not felt obliged to explain that\nassumption theoretically, even in passing. In the wake of\nBuddhism\u2019s sway during much of the Tang dynasty, Neo-Confucians\nof the Song and later dynasties explicitly accounted for the reality\nof the world by positing a generative substantial force, qi\n(: ki), capable of assuming a variety of forms: liquid,\nsolid, and ethereal. This generative force was the Neo-Confucian\nresponse to Buddhist claims regarding the essential insubstantiality\nof the world. Providing a sort of intelligible order to the world of\ngenerative force was the Neo-Confucian conception of an essential\nrational principle (C: li; J: ri) inhering in all\nthings. Together, rational principle and generative force constituted\nthe basic ingredients of a variety of expressions of the Neo-Confucian\naffirmation of the reality of the world. Theorists often differed\nregarding the priority of one notion in relation to the other, or\nwhether there was in fact any priority between them at all, but rarely\nwas it the case that later Confucian forays into metaphysical\nspeculation abandoned either of the two metaphysical ingredients\nentirely.\n\nAnother novel area of philosophical speculation was that related to\nspiritual forces. Confucius said little about them, other than that\npeople\u2019s proper concern should be how to live in the world of\nhumanity. Yet following the Buddhist discourses on the afterlife,\nrebirth, and various heavens and hells, Neo-Confucians were compelled\nto articulate various understandings of the spirit world. One of the\nmore commonly accepted positions defined ghosts and spirits (C:\nguishen; J: kishin) in terms of the spontaneous\nactivities of yin and yang in the world. Without\ndenying that there were spiritual forces, this account provided for a\nkind of naturalistic understanding of spiritual phenomena.\n\nNeo-Confucians were not always so innovative. Virtually all affirmed\nthe Mencian line that human nature was at birth good. Furthermore,\nmost acknowledged that the mind is endowed with the four beginnings of\nthis goodness as expressed in humaneness, righteousness, propriety,\nand wisdom. Supplementing Mencius\u2019 claims, however, many\nNeo-Confucians added that human nature was rational principle, giving\nall of humanity a common bond with the rational structure of the\nworld, and conversely giving the rational structure of reality common\nground with the essential goodness that otherwise characterized\nhumanity through human nature.\n\nThe interpenetration of the cosmos and the individual was pursued\nalong several other lines as well, perhaps most notably in the new\nexplanations of the ancient Confucian notion of humaneness in terms of\nforming one body with everything in the universe. This sort of\nmysticism, more characteristic of Daoism than classical Confucianism,\nwas one of the more distinctive features of many expressions of\nNeo-Confucianism. Clearly the theoretical insights of the later\nConfucian scholars were not formulated simply to oppose Buddhism: not\na few instances of Neo-Confucian philosophizing emerged as\nreformulations of appealing aspects of either Buddhism or Daoism. Such\nreformulations prompted many later critics of these innovative ideas\nto see in them offensive amounts of heterodox thinking that should\nhave been given no harbor in Confucian thought.\n\nOne example of Neo-Confucians reformulating ideas and/or introspective\npractices from Buddhism took the form of the often practiced, albeit\nsomewhat controversial, method of meditation known as jingzuo\n(Japanese: seiza), or \u201cquiet-sitting.\u201d With this\npractice, Neo-Confucians developed an alternative to the popular Chan\n(Zen) form of meditation known as zuochan (Japanese:\nzazen). The latter was meant to help the practitioner intuit\nthe essential emptiness of the ego, also understood as intuiting their\nBuddha nature, as well as the emptiness or insubstantiality of all\nthings. Neo-Confucians, however, emphasized that the introspective\nmoments achieved during quiet-sitting would lead to a comprehensive\nenlightenment wherein the person realized clearly the essential\ngoodness of their original nature as moral principle and its\nsimultaneous identity with the principle informing all things in the\nuniverse. This understanding of the ethical unity of the self and\nworld was the ground, as Neo-Confucians understood quiet-sitting, not\nfor withdrawal or inactivity but instead for a dynamic engagement with\nthe world.\n3. Introduction of Confucianism into Japan: Early Developments\n\nWith the territorial and cultural expansion of the Han dynasty into\nwhat is today known as the Korean peninsula, the stage was set for the\nintroduction of Confucian texts and teachings into Japan by way of the\nKorean kingdom of Paekche in the mid-6th century, along with Buddhism\nand the essentials of Chinese civilization. It must be noted that an\nancient Japanese text, Records of Ancient Matters\n(Kojiki, 712), relates that earlier, Keun Ch\u2019ogo, the\nruler of the kingdom of Paekche, had sent an instructor named Wani,\nalong with a copy of the Analects and another Chinese text,\nthe Thousand Character Classic (Qianziwen; Japanese:\nSenjimon), to the ruler of Yamato around 400 C.E. Presumably\nthe intent was that of educating the Yamato prince in Confucianism and\nthe Chinese language. Controversy surrounds this account, however,\nmaking acceptance of it problematic. Still, if nothing more, Wani was\na figure of considerable legendary and cultural significance who,\naccording to traditional accounts, was the first scholar-teacher of\nthe Analects to enter the Japanese islands.\n\nBy all accounts, Paekche served as an effective transmitter of\nConfucian texts and scholars in the mid-6th century. The most\nconspicuous new philosophical force conveyed by this transmission was\nthat of Buddhism, especially as represented in art and architecture.\nYet, alongside Buddhism came Confucianism, especially evident as a\nconceptually-defined philosophical system informing social, political,\nand economic relations and institutions.\n\nAn enduring early Confucian contribution to Japanese culture related\nto conceptions of historical time. In particular, it was in the wake\nof the introduction of Buddhism that the Japanese imperial court came\nto use neng\u014d (C: nianhao), or\n\u201cyear-names,\u201d as a means of counting the years within the\nreign of an emperor. This system had originated in China, during the\nHan dynasty, as emperors named the span of their rule to reflect the\nagenda and values they sought to embody. In 1912, with the founding of\nthe Chinese republic, the practice ended in China, but it is followed\neven today as the standard means of counting years in Japan. Insofar\nas virtually every one of the neng\u014d used in Japanese\nhistory as names for annual time has derived from Confucian texts,\nthere can be little question that Japanese understandings of calendric\ntime have been nuanced in accordance with Confucian philosophy.\n\nMuch the same can be said about the names associated with emperors.\nThough supposedly descended from an unbroken succession of Shint\u014d\ndeities tracing back to Izanagi and Izanami, progenitors of Amaterasu\nand Susanoo, Japanese emperors, mythic as well as historical, have\ntaken names that were distinctly Confucian in character. This\nconnection has remained throughout Japanese imperial history. In this\nrespect, the Confucian nuances of imperial names in Japan reveal\nsignificant limits of Shint\u014d as the sole foundation for all\nthings imperial.\n\nTo an extent, ancient Japanese conceptions of space also reflected\ndistinctly Confucian nuances. Yamato and Nippon were terms used to\nrefer to the imperial realm that came to be known, in the West, as\nJapan, but when ancient Japanese spoke in the most universal terms,\nreferring not just to their own socio-political realm but to the\nlarger world, they often did so by use of the expression\ntenka (C: tianxia), or\n\u201call-below-heaven.\u201d This term first appears in the ancient\nConfucian classical literature including in particular the Book of\nHistory and Book of Changes (Yijing).\n\nCosmologically, the ancient Japanese explained their origins, in part,\nin terms that were noticeably Confucian. Both the Records of\nAncient Matters (Kojiki) and the Chronicles of\nJapan (Nihon shoki) open with cosmological narratives\naccounting for the origins of the world, Japan, and the Japanese\npeople. One noteworthy ingredient in the narratives was that of the\n\u201cfive processes\u201d (C: wuxing; J:\ngogy\u014d): wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These\nprocesses were in effect ontological forces that unfolded in\nprogressive incremental combinations, giving in turn a particular\nmetaphysical character to a time, place, or thing, as well as a\ndiscernible dynamic rhythm to change. Not surprisingly, the cosmology\nof the Kojiki and Nihon\nshoki reflects the eclectic outlook of Han Confucianism.\n\nTextually, perhaps the most conspicuously Confucian-influenced writing\nof ancient Japan is the so-called \u201cSeventeen-Article\nConstitution\u201d (J\u016bshichij\u014d kenp\u014d)\nattributed to Prince Sh\u014dtoku (573\u2013621). Although this\ndocument was not so much a constitution in the sense of a blueprint\nfor government and political organization as a set of maxims meant to\nserve as standards for political society, it is clearly influenced by\nConfucianism throughout. The opening article states, \u201cHarmony is\nto be valued,\u201d alluding to the Analects (1/12). In most\nof the remaining articles, the Constitution advances a secular\nadvocacy of Confucian social principles such as the importance of the\nnatural hierarchy informing the political realm, as well as political\nvirtues such as loyalty, obedience, ritual decorum, impartiality,\ndiligence, trustworthiness, moderation, and public-mindedness. Though\nthese could be easily dismissed as mere platitudes, their affirmation\nreflected the extent to which even at an early stage of political\ndevelopment Confucian notions were privileged at the very core of\nofficial discourse.\n\nThe political nomenclature that came to be used in ancient Japan,\nincluding the term, tenn\u014d, meaning\n\u201cemperor,\u201d also derived, at least in part, from a host of\nConfucian texts. To a large degree, Confucius and later Confucians\nwere teachers who emphasized the importance of learning as both a\nsource of pleasure and as a means for self-cultivation and even\nperfection in the form of sagehood. Given the political orientation of\nConfucianism, it should come as no surprise that study and learning\ncame to be considered the prerequisites for properly governing the\nrealm and bringing peace to the world.\n\nImportant political policies of ancient Japan also derived from\nConfucian philosophical teachings. The handen system of equal\nland distribution in Japan was an outgrowth of the\nMencius\u2019 account (3 A/3) of \u201chumane\ngovernment.\u201d Mencius explained that people cannot be expected to\nbe good law-abiding members of society if they do not have the basic\nmaterial needs of life including food, clothing, and shelter. To\nensure that people have these, Mencius advocated the\n\u201cwell-field\u201d (C: jingtian) system of land\ndistribution, allotting an equal share for all families. According to\nMencius, humane government begins with this system of land\ndistribution. Although promulgated in the wake of the Taika reforms of\nthe seventh century, this idealistic approach to land distribution was\nincrementally compromised by special allowances of semi-permanent land\nholdings for Buddhist temples, Shint\u014d shrines, aristocrats, and\nsamurai rulers. Still, the very attempt at its implementation\nreflected the extent to which the ancient Japanese initially sought to\nrealize egalitarian Confucian thinking about landholding as a means of\nestablishing the ethical foundations of political society.\n\nAnother noteworthy institution was the daigakury\u014d, or\nthe imperial academy, established for the education of imperial\nprinces and aristocrats who were likely to be involved in government\nservice. Ancient Japan never followed the Chinese practice of\nselecting bureaucrats by way of civil service exams based on Confucian\nlearning and its practical applications. Yet, in sponsoring the\ndaigakury\u014d and a variety of provincial schools modeled\non the blueprint articulated in the Confucian Book of Rites,\nancient Japan established an elite educational system centered largely\naround the study of Confucian texts and the socio-political values\nadvanced in them.\n\nFollowing the Genpei War (1180\u20131185), a samurai regime was\nestablished in Kamakura. Religiously and philosophically, the Kamakura\nregime was far more eager to advance the development of Rinzai Zen\nBuddhism, for example, rather than the teachings of Confucius. While\nthe latter had spread significantly during the peaceful years of\naristocratic imperial rule, they suffered for centuries during the\nmedieval period when warrior regimes preferred the arts of war as a\nmeans to power over the Confucian foundations of moral virtue and\nritual refinement. The upheaval of the medieval period thus witnessed\na relative eclipse of Confucianism as it came to be enveloped, at\nbest, in a new syncretic cultural order, typically dominated by either\none form of Buddhism or another as they responded to the social and\npersonal suffering of the times.\n\nConfucianism and Buddhism were, however, always closely interrelated\nthroughout Japanese history. The introduction of Confucianism, for\nexample, came alongside of the introduction of Buddhism. Later the\nNeo-Confucian teachings of various Song philosophers including the\nCheng brothers, Zhu Xi, and Lu Xiangshan, were introduced to Japan\nbeginning in the thirteenth century, by Zen monks who had traveled to\nChina for advanced study of Chan teachings there. For centuries, the\nteachings of the Song philosophers remained subjects of study largely\nwithin the confines of Zen monasteries, attaining no independent\nexistence or philosophical integrity apart from Zen. This should\nhardly be surprising, given that Neo-Confucian philosophers such as\nZhu Xi had themselves come to develop their Confucian thinking after\nearlier study and practice of Chan Buddhism. While Zhu Xi came to\ncriticize Buddhism, other Neo-Confucians did not see Buddhism as\nnecessarily antithetical to Confucianism or Neo-Confucianism.\nUltimately, however, many Neo-Confucians did come to be more\ndistinctive and unrelenting critics of Buddhism than tolerant\ncompetitors.\n\nSome of the first indications of an effort to establish Neo-Confucian\nlearning as an independent branch of study and practice can be seen in\nthe reigns of Emperor Hanazono (r. 1308\u20131318) and Godaigo (r.\n1318\u20131339). Godaigo\u2019s ill-fated Kenmu Restoration, an\nattempt at restoring full political power to the imperial line, was\ngrounded in part in his understanding of imperial authority as defined\nby Neo-Confucian texts. This complemented efforts by Watarai\nShint\u014d theorists like Kitabatake Chikafusa who, at about the same\ntime, were trying to shore up Shint\u014d arguments for imperial\nauthority. Also, during the Ashikaga period, some Rinzai Zen monks\nreturned from study in China advocating forms of Neo-Confucian\nlearning for their shoguns. And in the early 15th century, the\nAshikaga shogunate established the Ashikaga Academy where supposedly\nseveral thousand students of Neo-Confucian teachings studied. Yet\nstill, the students were Zen monks.\n\nIf the inclusion of Confucian icons within samurai architecture can be\nconstrued as evidence of the philosophical comeback of Confucianism,\nOda Nobunaga\u2019s (1534\u20131582) Azuchi Castle, featuring\npaintings of Confucius and a host of Confucian sage figures, is surely\nworthy of mention. The ultimate standing accorded Confucianism in\nAzuchi Castle suggests that Nobunaga\u2019s thinking was moving away\nfrom battlefield strategies and toward the task of governing the realm\nand providing for peace and order throughout, especially as he\nunderstood Buddhist institutions to be a threat rather than aid to his\nplans for political control.\n4. Early-Modern Confucianism: Major Philosophical Themes\n\nJapanese developments of Confucian philosophy are often discussed in\nrelation to the Tokugawa period (1600\u20131868), with scant mention\nof what came before, other than to say that Confucian thought had been\nsubmerged earlier in an eclecticism dominated by Zen monks. Tokugawa\nConfucianism is typically described by recitation of a succession of\nnames and schools. Much of this approach to the philosophical history\nof Japanese Confucianism derives from interpretations advanced by\nInoue Tetsujir\u014d (1855\u20131944), professor at T\u014dky\u014d\nImperial University, in his monumental trilogy dating from the late\n19th and early 20th centuries. Inoue is noteworthy for having viewed\nJapanese Confucianism as \u201cphilosophy\u201d\n(tetsugaku), and for affirming that Confucian scholars had\nset forth substantial and diverse philosophical perspectives in Japan\nwell in advance of the introduction of Western philosophy.\n\nVaguely following Hegelian notions of thesis, antithesis, and\nsynthesis, Inoue described the unfolding of Japanese philosophy by\nexplaining the dialectical relationships of three major philosophical\nschools: the Zhu Xi School, the Wang Yangming School, and the School\nof Ancient Learning. Ever since Inoue, Japanese Confucianism has been\nmost typically explained in terms of these three schools, as\nrepresented by a succession of philosophers associated with each,\nincluding Zhu Xi philosophers such as Fujiwara Seika\n(1561\u20131617), Hayashi Razan (1583\u20131657), Yamazaki Ansai\n(1619\u20131682); Wang Yangming philosophers such as Nakae T\u014dju\n(1608\u20131648) and Kumazawa Banzan (1619\u20131691); and\nso\u2013called Ancient Learning philosophers such as Yamaga Sok\u014d\n(1622\u20131685), It\u014d Jinsai (1627\u20131705), and Ogy\u016b\nSorai (1666\u20131728).\n\nRather than recite this interpretive schema, which in many respects,\ndespite its trilogistic appeal, simply does not accurately represent\ndevelopments of Japanese Confucianism, this essay will offer an\nalternative approach. Here, Confucian philosophy is explained as a\ndiscourse comprised of major concepts addressed by virtually all who\nwould be called Confucian philosophers. Quite typically, Japanese\nConfucians articulated their philosophical visions by defining terms\nthat were at the core of their systems. While accounts of the meanings\nof words varied widely, an easily discernible discourse developed.\n\nOverall, Japanese Confucianism from the seventeenth through the\nearly-nineteenth centuries reasserts the integrity of language,\nmeaning, and discursive truth. This reassertion was made in opposition\nto the Buddhist view of language which was, despite myriad sutras in\nthe Tripitaka, or the Buddhist canon, rather negative. Or at least\nthis was how many early-modern Japanese Confucians understood it.\nAccording to these Confucian critics, the Buddhists held that ordinary\nlanguage lacked ultimate meaning and the ability to convey absolute\ntruth. Rather than packed with significant meaning, Buddhists insisted\nthat words were to be viewed as inherently empty. If wrongly\nunderstood as conveyors of substantial meaning, they became the source\nof profound error. Perhaps the unifying feature of Confucian\nphilosophizing in the early modern period was the view that words were\ncrucially important as vehicles for substantial meaning. Moreover,\nwords and their correct usage were deemed by Confucians as absolutely\nessential to self-understanding, self-cultivation, and at the grandest\nlevel, to governing the realm and bringing peace and prosperity to the\nworld. In this regard, Japanese Confucian philosophy can be viewed as\nan East Asian philosophy of language engaged in a search for right\nmeaning. This \u201cright meaning\u201d was considered fundamental\nto any attempt to resolve philosophical problems.\n\nInsofar as the ultimate achievement of Japanese Confucian\nphilosophizing amounted to a relative turn away from nominalist\nBuddhist claims about the semantic emptiness of words and the merely\nconventional nature of meaning and truth, it set the philosophical\nstage in profound ways for the conceptual assimilation of Western\nphilosophical learning during the Meiji period (1868\u20131912).\nBecause it was, when viewed comprehensively, a conceptual movement of\nenormous consequence relative the development of modern philosophy in\nJapan, the period from the seventeenth through the early-nineteenth\ncenturies is referred to here as \u201cearly modern,\u201d\nemphasizing its role in establishing the foundations of modernity,\nrather than in terms of the more traditional terminology of historical\nperiodization where the \u201cTokugawa\u201d or \u201cEdo\u201d\nperiod is often associated with either \u201clate medieval\u201d or\n\u201cfeudalistic\u201d developments. Apart from the contributions\nof Confucian philosophy to early-modern understandings of language,\nmeaning, and discursive truth, Confucian philosophizing in Japan\nduring this period was simply not always related to or an expression\nof the interests of the Tokugawa shoguns, nor did it always issue from\nthe shogun\u2019s capital, Edo. Thus, the terms\n\u201cTokugawa\u201d and \u201cEdo\u201d as historical categories\ndo not satisfactorily convey the generally progressive proto-modern\nthrust of Confucian philosophizing as a whole during this period.\n\nAdditionally, Japanese Confucian philosophy emerged in no small part\nin opposition to the western religion of Christianity and all that was\nassociated with it, including the threat of possible domination. While\nthis was true throughout the Tokugawa period and in the Meiji as well,\nit is nowhere more conspicuous than in an early Tokugawa work,\nEthics (Irinsh\u014d) by Matsunaga Sekigo. Writing\nshortly after the brutal defeat of the Christian-nuanced Shimabara\nRebellion of 1637\u201338, Sekigo used words rather than swords to\ncombat what he viewed as the dangerous foreign heterodoxy might mean\nruin to the Japanese polity. Unlike the earlier debates against the\nChristians carried out by the Buddhists on strictly metaphysical\ngrounds Seikigo aimed to demonstrate the superiority of Confucianism\nas a philosophy that was universal, in his view, and yet distinctively\nEast Asian and Japanese in its cultural roots. Arguably, later\naffirmations of Confucianism were meant to do much the same, even long\nafter the effective threat of the spread of Christianity had been\nstopped by government policies such as Buddhist temple registration.\nSomewhat similarly, in the late Meiji, Inoue Tetsujir\u014d defined\nJapanese Confucianism as Japan\u2019s first philosophy, yet he also\nstood as one of the most outspoken and vehement critics of\nChristianity as a system of thought that was inherently mistaken and\ncompletely inappropriate for Japanese. Throughout much of its history,\nJapanese Confucianism has therefore implicitly if not explicitly\nopposed Christianity on philosophical grounds.\n4.1 Language\n\nAs various forms of Buddhism dominated the medieval period of Japanese\nphilosophical history, so did Buddhist estimations of words and\nmeaning come to inform the minds of many of the philosophically\ninclined. While some aspects of Rinzai Zen esteemed components of\ntraditional Chinese arts and letters, the more central spiritual\npraxis was more renowned for its their anti-intellectualism. This\nlatter stance was well expressed in the use of k\u014dan, or\nparadoxical exchanges meant to facilitate realization of\nBuddha-nature. The gist of the Zen teachings was that words, at best,\nare mere conventions useful for everyday communication. The\ntransitory, insubstantial way of things (suchness or emptiness) cannot\nbe adequately captured by the fixed meanings of conventional language.\nWhen transmitted from teacher to disciple, the highest level of truth\ncould only be conveyed in a mind-to-mind transmission, one that\ntypically eluded simple discursive language.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Neo-Confucian position of early-modern Japan\nwas defined in opposition to assertions of the semantic emptiness or\nradical nominalism so often advanced by Buddhists. While the\nNeo-Confucian affirmation that words convey significant meaning might\nseem commonplace, it was hardly so at the juncture of Japan\u2019s\nmedieval and early modern history. Indeed, the rise of Neo-Confucian\ndiscourse in the Tokugawa should be understood as a reassertion of the\nmeaningfulness of language and its ultimate value in relation to any\nunderstandings of truth.\n\nAn early expression of the Neo-Confucian belief in the ultimate value\nof language and meaning was made by Hayashi Razan in the preface to\nhis colloquial rendition of Chen Beixi\u2019s (1159\u20131223)\nThe Meanings of Neo-Confucian Terms (Xingli ziyi).\nIncidentally, the latter text can easily be interpreted as a sustained\nreaffirmation of the correct meanings of terms in the wake of an age\nof semantic skepticism, and as a defense of Confucian realism over\nrampant Buddhist nominalism. That Razan devoted much of his final\nyears to authoring a lengthy colloquial explication of Beixi\u2019s\nZiyi speaks volumes about his view of the importance of\nlanguage. In his preface, Razan explained the crucial nature of\nlanguage by reasoning that \u201cthe minds of the sages and worthies\nare manifest in their words, and their words are found in their\nwritings. Unless we understand the meanings of their words, how can we\ncomprehend the minds of the sages and worthies?\u201d Elsewhere Razan\nemphasized that people could never realize the minds of the sages and\nworthies in themselves unless they first understood the remarks of the\nsages and worthies as recorded in the words of texts communicating\nthem.\n\nRazan even suggested that thorough immersion in the words of the sages\nwas the best way to achieve a kind of comprehensive, mystic\nenlightenment experience. Thus when asked about the methods involved\nin the study of words, Razan explained,\n\nRead them horizontally! Read them vertically! Read them from the left\nand from the right! Comprehend their source! Analyze them and\nsynthesize them until you thoroughly penetrate them from beginning to\nend. Ultimately you will understand that everything in the\nsages\u2019 writings culminates in a unified grasp of principle. When\nyou realize a mystical unity with the sages\u2019 writings, one in\nwhich the self and those texts are non-dual, you will have read them\nwell! How could that be true only of the Six Classics? The\nsame method holds for reading other classics!\n\n\nRazan was hardly alone in emphasizing the semantic integrity of words.\nIt\u014d Jinsai\u2019s most comprehensive philosophical text, the\nGom\u014d jigi (The Meaning of Words in the Analects and\nMencius), articulates both a defense of the meaningfulness of\nwords, and in-depth, systematic analyses of the meanings of some two\ndozen high-level philosophical terms. In his preface to the\nGom\u014d jigi, Jinsai explained his pedagogical approach in\nterms of the study of language and meaning. There he stated,\n\nI teach students to scrutinize the Analects and\nMencius thoroughly so that they will discern the lineage and\nsemantic importance of the sagely Confucian concepts. When so trained,\nstudents recognize the true lineage of [philosophical] notions and\nfathom their meanings without error. Too few scholars study such\nphilological matters as they relate to the study of meaning, despite\nthe fact that a single misinterpretation can lead to errors that are\nhardly trivial. Detailed philological studies of the Analects\nand Mencius facilitate understanding of those sagely texts\nand keep students from erratically manipulating them by imposing their\nsubjective thoughts on them.\n\n\nJinsai\u2019s emphasis on semantic etymology and philological\ninstruction was meant to offset Buddhist training and presuppositions:\nhe wanted his students to recognize the difference between Buddhist\nterms with their various nuances and those of Confucianism. In\nparticular Jinsai was offended to see so many seemingly Buddhist terms\nin Neo-Confucian discourse. In an attempt to rid such terms from\nNeo-Confucianism, Jinsai took great pains to document the heterodox\nlineages of words so that they could be eliminated from Neo-Confucian\nwritings.\n\nBrief introductory essays defending the ability of language to refer\nto reality are relatively common in early-modern Neo-Confucianism.\nOgy\u016b Sorai\u2019s (1666\u20131728) Benmei\n(Distinguishing Names), presents an even more in-depth\nanalysis of philosophical terminology than Jinsai\u2019s\nGom\u014d jigi. In the preface to his Benmei, Sorai\nhighlighted the political edge intrinsic to language and meaning, at\nleast as understood by many Confucians and Neo-Confucians alike. After\nallowing that some words are coined by commoners, Sorai emphasized\nthat the more abstract and philosophical terms are the very ones\narticulated by sages for the sake of instructing people in the\nfoundations of civilized life. Sorai then added that because these\nterms convey such powerful teachings, princes are cautious in using\nthem.\n\nSorai next alludes to a passage from the Analects (13/3)\nwhich relates that Confucius had said that if given charge of the\ngovernment of a state, his first priority would be correcting the\nmeanings and usages of words. When asked the reason for this,\nConfucius replied in effect that socially and politically, all else\ndepends upon correct usage of language. Without that, there would be\nno limits to which people might go. Sorai proceeds to sketch his\nunderstanding of the problems related to philosophical meaning in his\nday, adding that his intent in authoring the Benmei was to\nunderstand the right relationships between words and things so that\nthe minds of the sages could be fathomed.\n\nIn essence, Sorai believed that by rightly defining words he was\nproviding the foundations for the integrity of a rightly governed\nsocial and political order. Ultimately, then, Confucians and\nNeo-Confucians in their repeated reaffirmations of the importance of\nlanguage and meaning were not simply indulging in philological\nexercises or arcane semantic research. Instead, they were engaged in\nan effort to recover the way (C: dao/J: michi) for\nthe sake of establishing a means to sagely truth, and a ground for a\nrighteous political order.\n\nMany other examples of the Confucian reassertion of meaning in the\nearly-modern period could be given. Suffice it to say that the concern\nfor language so evident in Confucian writings reflected both a\nprofound turn away from what they considered to be the empty talk of\nBuddhists, especially Zen Buddhists, and toward a concern for defining\nthe conceptual bases for a well-ordered society. The need to defend\nthe integrity of language gradually subsided as Japanese thinkers\nincreasingly recognized the importance of words and meaning for\nphilosophical analysis. This reinforced an emphasis on linguistic\ntruth and meaning as a means for providing political order, an\nemphasis that continued well into the modern period.\n4.2 Metaphysics\n\nAn important Neo-Confucian contribution to the philosophical\nconsciousness of early-modern Japan was its metaphysical account of\nthe world of ordinary experience as fully real. Early in the Tokugawa\nperiod, Hayashi Razan was among the leaders of those Japanese\ntheorists who reiterated, with some distinctive variations, the\nmetaphysical accounts synthesized by Zhu Xi during late-Song China.\nEssentially, this metaphysics explained reality in terms of two\ncomponents, ri (\u201cprinciple\u201d or\n\u201cpattern\u201d) and ki (\u201cgenerative\nforce\u201d). Ri referred to the rational and moral order of\nthings generally, as well as that of each and every thing in terms of\ntheir particulars. In Razan\u2019s view, there is a ri for\neach aspect of existence, making all particulars what they are in\nactuality. At the same time, there is an essential universal element\nin ri that defined a larger realm of commonality in terms of\nwhat things can potentially be. Thus, for example, the human nature\nthat defines all people as people is referred to as ri,\nindicating that the rational order integral to humanity is shared in\ncommon. But more importantly, there is a normative, moral side of\nri which makes it as much an ethical aspect of existence as\nit is a rational one. In the case of humanity, as well as virtually\nall of the ten-thousand things of the cosmos, ri is defined\nas morally good. This affirmation means, in the case of humanity, that\nhuman nature is good. Viewed in the perspective of all things existing\nbetween heaven and earth, the goodness of ri means that the\nworld as such is also ethically good by nature and in terms of what it\nis to become as well. No doubt evil enters in, but that is not the\noriginal state, nor should it be the ultimate fate of things.\n\nThe other component of reality, that of ki, accounts for the\nsubstantial, creative reality of all that exists in the world. Ki\nis the vital, transformative stuff of all that exists, including\nthings that are solid, liquid, and gaseous. This ki is\ndescribed variously in terms of its clarity or turbidity, but\ninvariably things that exist have it as their substantial being.\nSimply put, nothing exists without ki. In certain respects,\nNeo-Confucian philosophers such as Zhu Xi and Razan affirmed that\nki was the stuff of reality in order to counter the Buddhist\nclaim that all things are insubstantial or empty. While admitting that\nthings are not always as they might seem, Neo-Confucians typically\naffirmed that there was a substantial basis even behind the illusory\nand ephemeral.\n\nGenerally speaking, Razan and other Neo-Confucian philosophers who\naffirmed the duality of ri and ki added that it was\nimpossible for there to be ri without ki, or\nki without ri. In reality, the two were absolutely\ninseparable. Yet there were moments of equivocation, especially while\nanalyzing the two notions, when Razan, following a long line of\nNeo-Confucian philosophers including Zhu Xi himself, emphasized the\npriority of ri over ki. No sooner was this broached,\nhowever, than it was also denied, with the appended insistence that\none could not exist without the other. Nevertheless, later critics of\nthe more standard Neo-Confucian line rarely bypassed the opportunity\nto criticize at length those who privileged ri over\nki.\n\nIt\u014d Jinsai was one such critic. It would be easy to conclude that\nsince Jinsai differed with orthodox Neo-Confucians such as Zhu Xi and\ntheir Japanese exponents, including Razan and others, that he was not\na Neo-Confucian himself. There can be no doubt that Jinsai was not an\northodox, Zhu-Xi style Neo-Confucian. But then being a Neo-Confucian\ndid not necessarily mean that one had to agree with Zhu Xi on all\ncounts. Indeed Neo-Confucians often criticized one another to no end,\nbut nonetheless remained Neo-Confucians. Doubt, questioning, and\nrigorous critique were at the heart of Neo-Confucianism as a\nphilosophical movement. Jinsai\u2019s inclusion of a metaphysics of\nki and ri, along with his critical disagreement with\nZhu Xi over their relative priority, arguably made him an exemplary\nNeo-Confucian. Certainly, there was scant ground for such a systematic\nmetaphysics as Jinsai affirmed in any of the ancient texts, especially\nthe Analects and Mencius, that he otherwise\nidentified with. In this respect, the common characterization of\nJinsai as an \u201cancient learning\u201d (kogaku)\nphilosopher who simply rejected Neo-Confucianism is misleading.\n\nRather than a dualism of generative force and principle, Jinsai\naffirmed an ostensible monism of ki, one which held that\nnothing existed other than ki. Yet Jinsai did not deny that\nthere is ri in the world: rather, he simply subordinated it\nto ki, suggesting that while only ki exists,\nri dwells within ki. Apart from its embedded nature\nwithin ki, ri has neither priority nor independent\nontological status of any sort. It is wholly enveloped within\nki. In making these claims, Jinsai was in effect rebalancing\nthe more orthodox but often ambiguous Neo-Confucian metaphysics, away\nfrom its more standard equivocation hesitantly favoring some sort of\nprior status for ri by insisting in a more thoroughgoing\nmanner a monism of generative force.\n\nA corollary of Jinsai\u2019s outspoken subordination of principle\nwithin generative force was his denial of the relatively orthodox\nNeo-Confucian claim that human nature is united in morally good\nri. Rather than a universalistic affirmation of the goodness\nof human nature, Jinsai emphasizes the diversity of human nature as a\nperson\u2019s inborn disposition, ranging from good to bad. Needless\nto say, Jinsai saw the Cheng-Zhu claim that human nature is principle,\nor ri, as profoundly mistaken. After all, in Jinsai\u2019s\nview, ri, which as a written word depicts the veins in a\npiece of jade, was a \u201cdead word,\u201d i.e., one that refers to\nan inanimate order not typically associated with the vitality of the\nhuman world. In contrast to ri, Jinsai extolled\nmichi, or the way, as a \u201cliving word,\u201d i.e., one\nwhich symbolized the dynamism of human activity.\n\nJinsai and Sorai both criticized the Neo-Confucian metaphysical notion\nof principle, stating that rather than a word with ancient, and\ntherefore legitimate, Confucian origins, ri was a term that\nhad derived in part from Daoist and Buddhist discourse and so was\noften wrongly construed in Neo-Confucian discussions out of ignorance\nof, or disregard for, the sanctity of the original teachings of\nConfucianism. Jinsai\u2019s standard on this count was supposedly the\nlexicon of the Analects and Mencius, while\nSorai\u2019s was the more ancient Six Classics. Despite\ntheir disagreements on the level of antiquity that should be\nconsidered as the source of legitimate philosophical discourse, both\nagreed that principle was a problematic part of it and so should not\nbe naively highlighted in metaphysical discussions.\n\nJinsai and Sorai\u2019s critiques notwithstanding, the metaphysics of\nri and ki came to enjoy a degree of philosophical\ndomination in the remainder of the early modern period, especially\namong orthodox Neo-Confucians. Although often modified in one respect\nor another, the dualism of substantial, energetic generative force and\nrational, ethical order seemed like a compelling and sufficient\naccount for the diversity of experience. Not surprisingly, both\nri and ki were appropriated in any number of\nneologisms of the Meiji period to refer to terms from western\nphilosophy and the sciences as they were translated into Japanese. One\nexample is the word \u201clogic,\u201d or ronri in\nJapanese. The word ronri, when considered not as a unified\nword but as two words that can be read apart, indicates\n\u201cdiscussions (ron) of principle (ri),\u201d a\ntypically Neo-Confucian activity. Although there were Huayan Buddhist\nusages of these terms, when the modern lexicon of theoretical\ndiscourse crystalized in the Meiji period, it was the Neo-Confucian\nusages that were then most relevant to the new terms coined such as\nronri.\n4.3 Doubt and the Critical Spirit\n\nOne of the more distinctive features of the various expressions of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy in early-modern Japan was their shared\nemphasis on the importance of doubt in learning. Chinese philosophers\nfrom the Song dynasty, from Zhang Zai (1020\u20131077) through Zhu\nXi, emphasized the need for doubt and skepticism in relation to\nachieving any real progress in philosophical learning. In Japan, doubt\ncame to have notable advocates, first with Hayashi Razan, one of the\nearliest and most consistent advocates of Neo-Confucianism, and later\nwith Kaibara Ekken (1630\u20131714), to the end a professed\nNeo-Confucian, but one who advanced one of the most systematic\nexpressions of philosophical doubt in the early-modern period. With\nRazan and Ekken, skepticism was never an end in itself, but rather a\nsignificant waypoint on the way toward coming to more solid\nconclusions regarding philosophical questions, and indeed, all matters\nrelated to informed engagement in this world.\n\nOne of Ekken\u2019s most famous texts, the Taigiroku, is an\naccount of his professed doubts about the validity of the teachings of\nZhu Xi. Ekken opens his work by quoting Lu Xiangshan\n(1139\u20131192), Zhu Xi\u2019s contemporary, who observed,\n\u201cIn learning, a person should be worried when he has no doubts.\nIf he has doubts, then progress follows. As a result, he will learn\nsomething.\u201d Zhu Xi made the case for doubting along similar\nlines, noting, \u201cThose with major doubts make much progress.\nThose with minor doubts make little progress. Those without doubts\nmake no progress.\u201d Such remarks relating to the need for doubt\nand its resolution were quoted and paraphrased repeatedly by Razan,\nEkken, and a number of others, as they sought to realize higher levels\nof philosophical confidence or even certitude regarding their\npositions.\n\nOne reason for the invitation to doubt extended by Neo-Confucians\nseems to have been their realization that many Neo-Confucian tenets,\nespecially metaphysical ones, were profoundly novel. Upon first\nhearing these new ideas, students might have many questions before\nthey could accept them. So, the Neo-Confucians typically encouraged\nstudents to ask questions and reflect critically on the matters\nprompting their doubts. By doing so, the critical spirit so often\nassociated with philosophy as a discipline in the West was clearly\ninstilled in the early-modern students of Neo-Confucian thought. There\ncan be little question that the number of extended critiques of\nNeo-Confucian thinking in the early-modern period were in part an\noutgrowth of the invitation to doubt advocated by proponents of\nNeo-Confucianism. Far from a rigid and unchanging orthodoxy that\nallowed for little if any questioning and doubt, Neo-Confucianism\nactively engaged doubt as a prerequisite to progress in learning.\n4.4 Ethics\n\nConfucian philosophy in Japan, ancient, medieval, and early-modern, is\noften caricatured as a teaching of loyalty and trustworthiness, that\nis, one suited to authoritarian rulers and obedient subjects, as well\nas warrior-lords and their samurai followers. No doubt loyalty and\ntrustworthiness were integral to the Confucian ethic, but equally\nimportant were more universal ethical prescriptions such as humaneness\n(jin). Humaneness was described variously, but most often\nassociated with the injunction not to do to others what one would not\nwant done to oneself. Humaneness might well be deemed the most\nquintessential of all Confucian and Neo-Confucian virtues. While\nNeo-Confucians affirmed the ancient and fundamental meaning of\nhumaneness as the \u201cgolden rule,\u201d they added substantially\nto the meaning of humaneness by suggesting that being truly humane led\none to become mystically one body with everything in existence. While\nsuch a unity was grounded substantially in the single generative force\nconstituting all reality (ichigenki), it was equally a\nfunction of recognizing other selves as oneself, and other entities,\nsentient or not, as part of a cosmic, familial continuum of essential\noneness and wholeness. Moreover, the unity reflected one\u2019s\nimmersive participation in the generative activities of heaven and\nearth, and ultimate identification with the all-inclusive unity of the\nlimitless creative potential of the cosmos. At a more rationalistic\nlevel, this unity was equally grounded in a cognitive grasp of the\nrational principles defining human nature\u2019s goodness and the\ncore ethical goodness of all things and their limitless becoming.\n\nAnother ethical notion crucial to Confucian and Neo-Confucian ethics\nwas that of gi, or justice. Often translated as\n\u201crighteousness\u201d and \u201crightness,\u201d gi\nalso conveys a sense, in some contexts, of duty, responsibility, and\nobligation. To affirm that something or someone is gi\namounted to ethical praise of the highest order, while denying the\nsame meant virtual condemnation. Gi was often combined with\nhumaneness to form the compound, jingi, indicating humaneness\nand justice, inherently political virtues that established the clear\nlegitimacy of a regime embodying them.\n\nFrom Mencius forward, fidelity to gi was often defined in\nterms of one\u2019s willingness to sacrifice one\u2019s life if\nrealization of gi and one\u2019s continued existence could\nnot be realized in tandem. One of the most famous debates of the\nTokugawa period centered around an incident occurring in 1703\nconcerning a group of forty-seven samurai who had been left masterless\n(r\u014dnin) due to the shogun\u2019s forcing the suicide of\ntheir lord. The question was whether the r\u014dnin were\nacting according to gi in taking revenge upon the man who\nhad, in the first place, prompted their deceased lord to commit the\noffense that led to his being condemned to self-destruction. Clearly,\nthe issue was not the legal one of whether the r\u014dnin\nobeyed or disobeyed the law, but instead the moral one of whether they\nacted on the basis of a sense of rightness and justice. Opinions\nvaried, of course, but that the debate was widespread and meaningful\nreveals the extent to which Neo-Confucian ethical notions such as\ngi had become integral, substantive factors in public\ndiscourse in early-modern Japan.\n4.5 Mind\n\nThe early-modern Neo-Confucians commonly described mind as the master\nof the body. All of the body\u2019s activities are under the control\nof the mind. As a combination of ri (principle) and\nki (generative force), the mind can serve as the master of\nthe body because of its capacity for clear and unclouded intelligence.\nDue to the ri within it, the mind is originally good. Though\nevil might intrude into its workings, the mind\u2019s original state\nis one of ethical goodness.\n\nThe Neo-Confucian position may not seem particularly profound unless\nwe consider a Buddhist position it opposes. Namely, some Buddhists\nheld that the mind is essentially empty delusion and ignorance. Rather\nthan dismissing the everyday mind as the source of error, or\nadvocating the realization of a mind that is \u201cno-mind,\u201d\nNeo-Confucians sought to describe the mind as a real, substantial\nentity in which intelligible ethical and rational principles\nindwelled, enabling humanity to know both what is, and what is right.\nThe knowledge provided by the mind was not considered delusional or\nunreal, but rather as real as any could possibly be. Insofar as the\nprinciples that dwell within the mind are identical with those\npervading the external world, the mind became the foundation for a\nmystic union with all existent things.\n\nOften the mind was discussed in relation to the feelings issuing from\nit. Most Neo-Confucians considered human feelings \u2013 pleasure,\nanger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire \u2013 to issue from the\nmind when it encounters things. As long as these feelings are\nexpressed in accord with principle, they are considered natural\noutgrowths of the mind. If manifested insufficiently or to excess, the\nfeelings are judged to be negative and in need of control. So as to\nenable the mind to master itself appropriately, Neo-Confucians\nsometimes advocated a Zen-like practice called\n\u201cquiet-sitting.\u201d Essentially a meditation upon one\u2019s\noriginal, moral nature, quiet-sitting perceives the calmness and\nstillness of the mind before its engagement with the world of\nactivity. The latter was typically seen as a source of\noverstimulation, one which could easily distract or distort the mind.\nIf properly practiced, quiet-sitting could enable one to engage in any\nactivity without overstepping or falling short in terms of emotive\nreactions. Such a mind was viewed as one well-regulated in accordance\nwith the mean.\n\nNeo-Confucian critics such as It\u014d Jinsai and Ogy\u016b Sorai\nobjected to characterizations of the mind in terms of\n\u201cstillness\u201d and \u201ccalmness,\u201d asserting that\nthose attributes harked back to Buddhism or Daoism, not Confucianism.\nWhereas their criticisms had some merit, previous orthodox\nNeo-Confucians such as Hayashi Razan had insisted that the Confucian\nusage of terms such as \u201cstillness\u201d and\n\u201ccalmness\u201d meant something profoundly different from what\nwas meant by Buddhists and Daoists. Ultimately, Razan insisted, the\nmind is an active thing, meant to be engaged in ongoing relations with\nthe world at large and so, \u201cstillness\u201d is being poised for\nengagement, rather than an end in itself.\n4.6 Human Nature\n\nOne of the many terms used in East Asian philosophical discussions to\nrefer generally to the ideas of the Song philosophers of the Cheng-Zhu\ntradition and their exponents in later dynastic periods, was\nseirigaku (C: xinglixue), or \u201cthe school of\nhuman nature and principle.\u201d The two words \u201chuman\nnature\u201d (C: xing; J: sei) and\n\u201cprinciple\u201d (C: li; J: ri) were joined\nin part as a reflection of the Neo-Confucian identification of human\nnature with principle. In Japan, this position, equating human nature\nand principle, was affirmed by orthodox proponents of the Cheng-Zhu\nteachings such as Hayashi Razan and later, Yamazaki Ansai and their\nfollowers. In many respects, their accounts of human nature can be\nconstrued as an egalitarian affirmation of the commonly shared nature\nof all people. The grammar of most statements asserting the identity\nof human nature and principle support this understanding: they leave\nlittle room for doubt that orthodox Cheng-Zhu thinkers were saying\nthat all people have the same human nature, and that that human nature\nis principle. To the extent that they explained the myriad differences\nin humanity, they did so by reference to variations in the clarity or\nturbidity of the generative force (ki) of particular\nindividuals.\n\nThe ethical nuance assigned to human nature was a function of the\nCheng-Zhu understanding of principle in both positive and normative\nterms. Not only did principle indicate what \u201cis,\u201d it also\nreferred to what \u201cought to be\u201d in a particular entity. In\nall matters, including human nature, principle was considered to be\nmorally good. Thus at the macrocosmic level, the world of ordinary\nlife was viewed not as the Buddhists saw it in terms of delusion,\nerror, and anguish, but rather as the bountiful and morally good\ncreation of heaven and earth, leading to the on-going production and\nreproduction of the ten-thousand things of the world in which we live.\nAt the microcosmic level, rather than stressing human thoughts and\nfeelings as given to attachments leading to one painful rebirth after\nanother, the orthodox early-modern Neo-Confucians viewed the person as\nethically good by virtue of their human nature. Those with clear\ngenerative force perhaps better understood and manifested the goodness\nof their human nature, while those with more turbid generative force\ndid so less aptly. Nevertheless, with education and effort all could\nperfect themselves so as to realize fully the original goodness of\ntheir human nature. The human ideal of sagehood, more sought after\nthan perhaps ever actually realized, was recognized as one that all\ncould, with sufficient effort, achieve.\n\nThe orthodox Neo-Confucian explanation of human nature was frequently\naffirmed in early-modern Japan, especially in philosophically informed\ncircles. However, those circles tended to be populated by individuals\nrepresenting hereditary, status-bound social estates. At the top of\nthe social system were the aristocrats of the ancient imperial\ncapital, Ky\u014dto, including the imperial family. Yet, during the\nTokugawa period, the aristocracy was both respected and controlled by\nthe samurai leadership exercising coercive governing power. Apart from\nthe aristocracy, which was by and large restricted to the ancient\nimperial capital, the samurai were at the top of the secular social\nsystem. Below them were peasant farmers, then artisans, and finally\nmerchants. Shint\u014d and Buddhist clergy, often defined by\nhereditary lines as well, were esteemed as outside the secular social\nsystem. Thus, in practice, there was precious little egalitarianism in\nthe early-modern social system.\n\nReflecting the inequalities of the day, It\u014d Jinsai challenged the\northodox Neo-Confucian view by asserting that human nature is simply\nthe physical disposition (kishitsu) that each person is born\nwith. In formulating this view, Jinsai was essentially agreeing with\nDong Zhongshu (ca. 179\u2013104 B.C.E.), who defined human nature as\n\u201cthe inborn disposition\u201d of each person. But Jinsai also\nsympathized with the thinking of Zhou Dunyi (1017\u20131073), a Song\nphilosopher who is often considered an early exponent of the\nNeo-Confucian philosophy that found its most complete form in the\nthought of Zhu Xi. Zhou Dunyi differentiated five natures including\nthe morally strong, the immorally strong, the morally weak, the\nimmorally weak, and the mean which relies on neither strength or\nweakness.\n\nJinsai did not seek to advance Zhou\u2019s position as much as to\nexpand it into a recognition of the manifold diversity of human\nnatures. A scholar by profession, Jinsai\u2019s own social standing\nwas that of a townsperson, presumably of merchant background. The\northodox Neo-Confucian egalitarian position was at odds with the\nofficial hierarchy, but so was Jinsai\u2019s view insofar as it\naffirmed a far more individualized diversity than the established\nhierarchy allowed. Though Jinsai\u2019s theory of human nature as\ninnate, individual physical disposition was reformulated by Ogy\u016b\nSorai, it did not achieve wide acceptance in early-modern Japan.\nDespite the extent to which it was at odds with reality, Confucian\npronouncements on human nature in the early-modern period tended to\nrepeat the Neo-Confucian line that human nature, as principle\n(ri), is morally good.\n4.7 Political Thought\n\nThere is always a political nuance to Confucian philosophizing.\nConfucius himself first sought to offer his teachings to a ruler,\nthinking that they would provide an effective solution to the\npolitical crises of his times. The human ideal extolled by Confucius\nwas that of the junzi (J: kunshi), or the \u201cson\nof a ruler\u201d that is, a \u201cprince.\u201d (Some translators\nhave rendered this term as \u201cgentleman,\u201d \u201cnoble\nperson,\u201d or \u201cexemplary person.\u201d) But for Confucius,\nthe true prince was not one born to the position. Rather, Confucius\nmost admired the person who cultivated himself to such a point that he\nembodied a host of virtues associated with royal birth. Confucius had\nlittle use for the person who was born to that station but neglected\nthe task of self-cultivation. Such a person, in Confucius\u2019 view,\nhardly merited the standing accorded by birth. This understanding of\nthe true prince implied that those born to high rank must strive to\nearn, through self-cultivation, the kind of respect and right to\nexercise power otherwise associated with their standing.\n\nMencian political thought was grounded in the view that government\nought to be humane, and provide for the best interests of humanity. In\nthis context, the ruler was characterized as the parent of the people,\nand his subjects as his own children, emphasizing the importance that\nhe should attach to their welfare. Mencius at points explained success\nin governing as a matter of gaining the hearts-and-minds of the people\nat large, suggesting that without popular support rule would not be\neffective. In addressing questions related to instances in the past\nwhere tyrants had been executed, Mencius argued that there had been no\ninstances of regicide. Instead, those put to death had been common\ncriminals, having forfeited their legitimacy by their very\nmistreatment of people. Implied, of course, was that rulers who did\nthe same might be legitimately dealt with in a similar manner.\n\nGiven the conditional perspective that Confucianism affirmed in\nrelation to governing, it is not surprising that Confucian teachings\ntended to circulate first and foremost among the ruling elite\nthroughout most of Japanese history. After all, had they had a wider\ncirculation, the political implications might have resulted in even\nmore challenges to those in power than actually occurred. Even more\nproblematic than the views of Confucius and Mencius were those in the\nBook of Historical Documents related to the notion of\ntianming (J: tenmei), or \u201cthe mandate of\nheaven.\u201d According to numerous passages in the History,\nif a ruler repeatedly abandoned his concern for the people, heaven\nwould eventually give the mandate to rule to a new line, one that\ndistinguished itself on the basis of concern for the people. In this\nprocess, the role of the people was instrumental. One passage in the\nHistory even states that heaven and the people are nearly the\nsame: \u201cheaven sees with the eyes of the people, and hears with\nthe ears of the people.\u201d\n\nThere can be no question that this notion entered Japan, as surely as\nthe classical literature of China did. That the tianming\nnotion attained no wide circulation reflects the extent to which\nConfucian political teachings in particular were restricted to the\nruling elite rather than taught to the population at large. It must be\nadded, however, that as Confucian learning became more widespread,\neven the peasantry began to understand the basics of Confucian\npolitical thought and developed clear expectations regarding humane\ngovernment. Early-modern peasant protest movements and uprisings were\noften grounded in the notion that righteous and humane rulers ought to\nprovide for the just interests of society as a whole. When such\nexpectations were not fulfilled, it was not uncommon for peasants to\nmake their dissatisfaction evident through remonstration and\nrebellion.\n\nBy comparison with the ancient, foundational writings, Neo-Confucian\npolitical philosophy was far more concerned with the project of\nensuring that the ruler understood the benefits of self-cultivation.\nOne of the most pertinent texts, the Great Learning (C:\nDaxue; J: Daigaku), outlines how a ruler should\nproceed if he wishes to manifest luminous virtue, noting that the\nproject most fundamentally involves self-cultivation. For the latter\nto be realized, the ruler must first make his mind correct and his\nthoughts sincere. To realize this project, he must extend his\nunderstanding of things by studying and investigating them. If those\nruling could cultivate themselves in this way, then they would find\ntheir families well ordered, their states well governed, and all below\nheaven enjoying great peace. Effective rule was thus cast as a matter\nof self-cultivation on the part of those ruling. This was the central\npolitical philosophy taught by orthodox Neo-Confucians such as Hayashi\nRazan, Yamazaki Ansai and their followers in Tokugawa Japan.\n\nOne major challenge to this approach came from Ogy\u016b Sorai.\nAccording to Sorai, the orthodox Neo-Confucian position was\nimpractical because it was based on the assumption that the human mind\ncan control itself. In Sorai\u2019s view, this was simply impossible\nbecause it would entail dividing the mind into two entities: the\ncontrolling mind and the controlled mind. Rather than expect the mind\nto control the mind, Sorai appealed to the Book of History\nand its teaching that the rites of \u201cthe early kings\u201d be\nused to control not only the mind, but the socio-political realm at\nlarge. Sorai claimed that his philosophy was based on a correct\nreading of the ancient classics, especially the Book of\nHistory, but it is clear that he leaves a great deal out. Most\nparticularly, he passes over the tianming notion completely,\neven though it is at the very core of the Book of History.\nSorai also extolled the rites and music and their effectiveness for\nruling, but never provided great clarity regarding what these\nincluded. Moreover, he repeatedly praised \u201cthe early\nkings\u201d as the only sages who had and would ever exist in human\nhistory. The sagehood of the early kings was a function of their\nhaving established the way of social and political organization, a way\nthat could never be surpassed, only followed. Sorai identified that\nway, \u201cthe way of the sages,\u201d as consisting in the rites\nand music, as well as the laws and bureaucratic forms necessary for\ngood government.\n\nUltimately, it seems that Sorai\u2019s political philosophy meant to\nextol in later history those who stood as the representatives of the\nearly kings. For him, these were the samurai ruling elite of his day,\nand their imposition of rites, laws, and administrative government as\na means of implementing the greatest peace and prosperity for the\ngreatest number. Sorai surely had little faith in the efficacy of\ninternal means of self control; instead, he consistently advocated\nexternal strategies such as rites and music, penal laws, and\nadministrative government as the means for providing, along\nutilitarian lines, for the welfare of all.\n\nSorai\u2019s political philosophy, though one of the most systematic\nstatements offered during the early-modern period, was never fully\naccepted as the philosophy of the ruling elite, despite the fact that\nthat seems to have been Sorai\u2019s explicit intent. Rather, his\npolitical philosophy ended up being viewed as a heterodox alternative,\none much akin to that of Xunzi in ancient China.\n4.8 Education\n\nA most important contribution of Neo-Confucianism to early-modern\nJapanese culture was its emphasis on education at virtually all\nlevels. Orthodox Neo-Confucianism viewed learning as one of the most\nbasic methods of self-cultivation, one that contributed positively to\nthe full realization of a person\u2019s morally good human nature. At\nthe highest level, education and learning were considered integral\ncomponents in the realization of a well-governed state and peace\nthroughout the world.\n\nAccording to Zhu Xi, learning involved most basically the process of\nemulation. This account of learning came to be widely endorsed in\nearly-modern Japan, even by heterodox thinkers such as It\u014d Jinsai\nand Ogy\u016b Sorai. The model that Jinsai used in explaining learning\nas emulation was that of calligraphy. In learning to write, a student\nis presented with the example of his teacher, and then is expected to\nemulate it. Sustained efforts at emulation lead eventually to\ncomprehension and the ability of the student to perform thoughtfully\nthe task that has been learned.\n\nWhile the practice of learning as emulation was widely endorsed,\nearly-modern philosophers disagreed over the subject matter of\neducation. Orthodox Neo-Confucians typically emphasized broad learning\nin the ancient classics and historical literature, but most\nimportantly they extolled the value of studying the Four\nBooks and Zhu Xi\u2019s commentaries on them. Reflecting the\northodox Neo-Confucian value placed on education is the first of the\nFour Books, the Great Learning. Described as\nthe \u201cgateway\u201d to all subsequent learning, the Great\nLearning outlines the series of methods to be mastered in order\nfor a person to manifest luminous virtue. In this process, the\ninvestigation of things is preliminary. With such investigation, our\nunderstanding of things becomes complete and our thoughts sincere.\nThen, our minds are rectified. With this comes the realization of a\ncultivated self, one capable of regulating families, governing states,\nand bringing peace to the world.\n\nOrthodox Neo-Confucians viewed the Great Learning as a work\nfor mature students. To provide for the most widely educated society\npossible, other texts, such as the Elementary Learning,\naddressed topics for younger minds. In early-modern Japan, the\nNeo-Confucian emphasis on education also led to the formulation of a\ncurriculum for women, as is evident in the Great Learning for\nWomen (Onna daigaku), attributed to Kaibara Ekken, the\nElementary Learning on Samurai Teachings (Buky\u014d\nsh\u014dgaku) by Yamaga Sok\u014d, and other educational works\nfor townspeople and farmers.\n\nHeterodox thinkers such as Jinsai and Sorai often challenged orthodox\nNeo-Confucians on matters related to the texts elevated for study.\nJinsai in particular affirmed that the most important works for\nstudents were the Analects of Confucius and the\nMencius. Distancing himself considerably from the orthodox\nposition, Jinsai offered a series of arguments seeking to prove, on\ntextual and philosophical grounds, that the Great Learning\nwas not a Confucian text. While he admitted that there was value in\nthe study of the ancient classics, Jinsai believed that the\nAnalects and Mencius were by and large sufficient\nfor meaningful education.\n\nBy contrast, Ogy\u016b Sorai emphasized the efficacy of studying the\nSix Classics. In Sorai\u2019s view, the Six\nClassics conveyed the words of the sages predating Confucius. He\nconsidered their words unique insofar as they enabled humanity to\nfathom the minds of the sages themselves. Sorai did value texts such\nas the Analects, but decidedly less so. After all, Sorai\nreasoned, Confucius had not been fully a sage, at least not in his\nstrictest sense of the term. For him, the sages were those ancient\nfigures who had established the basic way of socio-political civilized\nlife, the way that Confucius later championed as a transmitter. Yet,\nfar more than learning through books, Sorai valued learning gained\nthrough practice in following the way. With this kind of performative\nlearning, students were expected to come gradually to realize a full\nlevel of practical knowledge: knowing how to do something rather than\nknowing that something is the case.\n\nThe proliferation of education in early-modern Japan, producing\nmid-nineteenth-century literacy rates comparable to those of the most\nadvanced Western nations, resulted from a complex set of factors,\nincluding the development of mass printing, the creation of schools in\nthe various samurai domains, and the rise of educational movements\nrelated to Japanese literature and culture that were highly critical\nof Chinese-style philosophy of any sort. Yet, at the base of much of\nthis was the Neo-Confucian view, shared generally by orthodox and\nheterodox thinkers, that education, whether practical or discursive or\nboth, was a necessary ingredient in the life of all persons who might\nhope to realize their full potential.\n4.9 Critiques of Buddhism\n\nThe liberation of Neo-Confucianism from the domination of Zen learning\nonly became possible in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth\ncenturies, following Toyotomi Hideyoshi\u2019s (1537\u20131598)\ninvasions of the Korean peninsula. As a result, a number of\nNeo-Confucian texts that included pointed critiques of Buddhism came\ninto Japan. As the anti-Buddhist perspectives of these texts came to\nbe ever more influential throughout the seventeenth century, an\nincreasingly common theme in Japanese Neo-Confucian discourse was its\nrelationship, positive or negative, to Buddhism.\n\nOne of the more interesting Confucian critiques of Buddhism was\narticulated by It\u014d Jinsai (1627\u20131705), a Ky\u014dto-based\nscholar who, significantly enough, had neither been brought up nor\neducated by Buddhists. In his discussion of \u201cthe way,\u201d\nJinsai suggested that the Buddha believed emptiness was the way, and\nthat mountains, rivers, and land masses were all unreal. In\nopposition, Jinsai argued along distinctly commonsensical lines: that\nfor myriad ages heaven and earth have sustained life; the sun and moon\nhave illuminated the world; mountains have stood and rivers flowed;\nbirds, beasts, fish, insects, trees, and grasses have lived as they do\nnow. Given this evidence from the phenomenal world, Jinsai asked how\nthe Buddhists could claim that all is emptiness or nothingness.\nAnswering his own question, Jinsai said that their emphasis on\nemptiness derived from their tending to retire to mountains and to sit\nsilently while emptying their minds. Thus, Jinsai argued, the\ntheoretical principles affirmed by the Buddhists \u2013 emptiness and\nnothingness \u2013 exist neither within this world nor outside it.\n\nInstead of Buddhist emptiness which he claimed to be groundless,\nJinsai affirmed that the principles of love and social relations are\nfound in every aspect of life from humanity down to bamboo plants,\ntrees, grasses, insects, fish, and even grains of sand. Jinsai denied\nthat Buddhist principles received any corroboration in any level of\nexistence whatsoever, dismissing them as heterodoxies utterly lacking\nany basis in reality.\n\nJinsai maintained that the Confucian way is how people should conduct\nthemselves ethically in their daily lives. In doing so, he asserted\nthat the Confucian way is both natural and universal insofar as it is\nunderstood by everyone in every part of the universe as the\ninescapable path of all. Because this has been and will be true for\nall time, it is simply called \u201cthe way.\u201d Amplifying his\npoint, Jinsai added that the Confucian way does not exist simply\nbecause it is taught. Rather, its vitality is naturally and\nuniversally so. By contrast, the teachings of Buddhism exist only\nbecause certain people revere them. If those people vanished, Jinsai\nmaintained, so would Buddhism. Emphasizing their lack of practicality,\nJinsai observed that even when Buddhist teachings are accepted, they\nbring no benefits. If they are rejected, people lose nothing. Worst of\nall, Jinsai said, when the world followed the teachings of the ancient\nConfucian sages, it was at peace, but since Buddhism had become\ndominant, great chaos and disturbances have ensued. Thus,\nJinsai\u2019s rejection of Buddhism follows, at least in part,\npragmatic lines, emphasizing that at best there is no gain from it,\nand at worst that it brings chaos and disorder to the world.\n\nJinsai also criticized Buddhists for abandoning ethics, in particular\nrighteousness and justice (gi). While he allowed that\nBuddhists taught the virtue of compassion, Jinsai added that they\nultimately extolled nirvana as the way. This led them to downplay\nrighteousness rather than recognize it as \u201cthe great path of all\nbelow heaven.\u201d\n\nJinsai emphasized the mind as the seat of the moral sentiments giving\nrise in action to the virtues of humaneness and righteousness. In\nmaking this point and at the same time emphasizing the vital activity\nof the mind, Jinsai enthusiastically endorsed the views of Mencius.\nJinsai pointedly criticized Buddhists and others who followed them for\nclaiming that the mind is empty. He also argued against the Buddhist\nbelief that the mind ought to be made pure, utterly rid of human\ndesires, and empty like a bright mirror or calm like still water.\nJinsai rejected such images for being at odds with the energetic\napproach to moral action that Confucianism endorses. For Jinsai, moral\naction emerges from moral sentiments and can never be divorced from\nthe passions. Because the Buddhists sought, according to Jinsai, to\neliminate passions in their pursuit of nirvana, their view of\nthe mind was fundamentally mistaken.\n\nYet for all of his criticisms of Buddhism, Jinsai explained, in one of\nthe appendices to his Gom\u014d jigi, that the best way to\nrefute Buddhism and heterodoxies generally was not by means of debate,\nbut instead by manifesting the Confucian way of ethical engagement\nwith the world in daily practical activities. Debate, argument, and\nrhetoric were, in Jinsai\u2019s view, little more than empty\nformulations reflecting descent into the same kind of emptiness that\nso characterized the Buddhist teachings one sought to oppose.\n\nIt might be added in this connection that Tokugawa Confucians often\nsought to outdo one another in their opposition to Buddhism. In one of\nhis more tolerant moments, Jinsai wrote a farewell letter to a\nBuddhist monk, D\u014dk\u014d (b: 1675?), who was about to depart\nKy\u014dto after a period of study there. In the letter, which Jinsai\nsurely never meant to be construed as a definitive statement of his\nviews on Buddhism, he praised D\u014dk\u014d\u2019s study of\nConfucianism. At one point, Jinsai graciously added, \u201cFrom the\nperspective of scholars, both Confucianism (Ju) and Buddhism\n(Butsu) definitely exist. However from the vantage point of\nheaven and earth, there is most fundamentally neither Confucianism nor\nBuddhism. Rather, there is only one way and that is all.\u201d\nJinsai\u2019s letter, which was subsequently published, shocked many\nConfucians who were far more doctrinaire in their opposition to\nBuddhism. One scholar, Sat\u014d Naokata (1650\u20131719), went so\nfar as to republish Jinsai\u2019s letter with a running commentary,\nsharply critical of both Buddhism and Jinsai. The latter was the\nsubject of Naokata\u2019s wrath because Jinsai, in Naokata\u2019s\nintolerant view, had been insufficiently hostile to the \u201cevil\nthing,\u201d namely, Buddhism.\n\nConfucian discourse on Buddhism, then, was much more complex than\nJinsai\u2019s critiques alone might suggest. But what is clear is\nthat during the early-modern period of Japanese intellectual history,\nConfucianism and Buddhism came to be fairly distinct philosophical\nforces, with much critical antipathy issuing from the Confucian camp.\nAs Confucian learning became increasingly secure and respected in its\nown right, these critiques tended to diminish. Ogy\u016b Sorai, for\nexample, rarely discussed Buddhism, though when he did his remarks\nwere critical. Still one senses that for Sorai and his audience,\nBuddhism did not need to be subjected yet again to a Confucian\ncritique. Buddhism had its own relevance for some people at certain\ntimes, and Confucianism had its own. Confucianism had arrived,\napparently, as a largely secular ethic with clear and distinct\nsocio-political relevance that to many suggested not just\nindependence, but even philosophical dominance.\n4.10 Ghosts and Spirits\n\nNeo-Confucian philosophical discussions, often featuring lengthy\nexplanations of \u201cghosts and spirits\u201d (C: guishen;\nJ: kishin), differed markedly from ancient Confucianism.\nConfucius declined to discuss spiritual matters at length, even when\nasked about them specifically. Why address the world after, Confucius\nasked, when one has yet to master the way of humanity within this\nworld? Confucius was not disrespectful of ceremonies for the spirits,\nbut he did emphasize that he maintained a respectful distance from\nthem. Still, if he found himself in attendance at such a ceremony, he\nbehaved as if the spirits were actually there. Confucius\u2019\nreluctance to discuss the spiritual dimension in any real detail has\nled many to speculate that he was an atheist, or perhaps a polite\nagnostic.\n\nIn the wake of Buddhism, however, it was impossible for Confucians to\nignore the topic of ghosts and spirits. Buddhist literature went into\ngreat detail about the Western Paradise, or the Buddhist Pure Land,\nand the many layers of hell where sinners would be punished by wardens\nof hell. Graphic depictions of the spirit world, heaven, hell, demons,\nhungry ghosts, and angelic bodhisattvas made the accounts seem all the\nmore credible. In Japan, Shinto as well had its own traditions of\nghosts, spirits, goblins, and changelings. To counter such discourse,\nNeo-Confucians formulated their own explanations of spiritual\nphenomena, ones offering a more naturalistic account of the apparent\nactivities of ghosts and spirits. These accounts can be interpreted as\nbordering on atheism or agnosticism and so are in keeping with\nConfucius\u2019 position, at least as some have interpreted it. Yet,\nthey were far more lengthy overall than anything that Confucius or\nmost prior Confucians had offered.\n\nA key feature of Neo-Confucian philosophical discussions of ghosts and\nspirits is their naturalistic metaphysical character. Rather than\npurporting to describe particular spirits, many Neo-Confucians,\nfollowing Cheng Yi, explained ghosts and spirits as \u201ctraces of\nthe creative transformations of the world.\u201d More specifically,\nNeo-Confucians often interpreted what appeared to be ghosts and\nspirits as \u201cthe spontaneous activities of the two generative\nforces,\u201d yin and yang. As yin and yang expanded and contracted,\nspiritual forces purportedly emerged with yang, and ghostly forces\nwith yin.\n\nWhile casting ghosts and spirits in metaphysical terms that in certain\nrespects seemed intent on explaining away ghosts and spirits,\nNeo-Confucians also affirmed that just as yin and yang pervade\nreality, so do ghosts and spirits. The spirits are simply the\nexpansive and ghosts, the contractive forces of the world. Recognizing\nthe interrelatedness of ghosts and spirits with the world at large,\nmany Neo-Confucians associated spirits with heaven, spring and summer,\nmorning, the sun, light, music, and so on, while ghosts were linked to\nthe earth, fall and winter, evening, the moon, darkness, rituals, and\nso forth. With this analysis, Neo-Confucians did not deny spirits, but\ninstead asserted that they infuse every aspect of reality just as\nsurely as do yin and yang.\n\nProviding a basis for ancestor worship, Neo-Confucians typically\nclaimed that within a family line, there is a shared generative force,\nwhich entails a shared spirituality. This common spirituality is\ncommunicated through the male line in ancestral rites performed by\nsons to their fathers, grandfathers, and so on. Because the shared\nfamily line was considered essential to the shared spiritual basis,\nNeo-Confucians emphasized that if a family had to adopt a child, then\nit should take care to adopt a son from a male relative of the father\nso that the sacrifices offered by the adopted son might be happily\naccepted by the spirits. If adoption was outside the male line of the\nfamily, then offerings to the family ancestors would actually be\ncommunicated to the family line of the adopted son, leaving the family\nthat had adopted the son unhappily neglected. In an effort to curb\npopular involvement in spiritualistic movements and practices,\nNeo-Confucians generally described as wanton and improper any\nparticipation in a religious ritual or ceremony that had no\nrelationship with the larger family involved with them.\n\nOne of the more heterodox Neo-Confucian accounts of ghosts and spirits\ncame from Ogy\u016b Sorai. Unlike the naturalistic explanations\nprovided by most Neo-Confucians, Sorai emphasized the integrity of the\naccounts of ghosts and spirits set forth by the ancient sage kings.\nSorai asserted that since the ancient kings had said that there were\nspirits, then there must indeed be spirits. Likewise with ghosts, as\nwell as a host of other spiritual beings. To question the existence of\nghosts and spirits was, in Sorai\u2019s view, to disrespect the\nancient sage kings. Sorai\u2019s insistence upon an unquestioning\nbelief in ghosts and spirits, however, was more the exception than the\nmainstream view among early-modern Japanese Confucians.\n4.11 Environment: Mountains, Rivers, and Forests\n\nOne of the great texts of Song dynasty Confucianism is Zhang\nZai\u2019s (1020\u20131070) \u201cWestern Inscription\u201d\n(Ximing). In its opening lines, Zhang states that he views\nheaven as his father, earth as his mother, and the ten thousand things\nof the world as his brothers and sisters. All that fills the space\nbetween heaven and earth he considers as his body. Elsewhere Zhang\nspoke more metaphysically, describing that which fills all between\nheaven and earth as qi, or the generative force (J:\nki) that is the creative substantial being and energy of\nbecoming in all things. Zhang also explained qi in terms of\nthe great vacuity, a notion that sounds Buddhistic but was meant to\ncapture the openness of all becoming to change and transformation. Yet\nin the end, qi was the rock bottom of Confucian realism,\nmetaphysically speaking, and was in large part the ontological\ndimension of things that prompted Confucians throughout East Asia to\ntake the world seriously not as a site of delusion and ignorance, but\ninstead as a both the crucible of their being and an extension of\nthemselves in becoming. Reportedly, Zhang\u2019s sense of oneness and\nkinship with everything between heaven and earth left him unable to\ncut the grass and bushes outside his window. Other Song Confucians\noffered their own vision of oneness with reality by declaring that the\nhumane person forms one body with the ten thousand things of\nexistence. These visions of oneness and kinship prompted Confucians to\npaint landscape (shanshui) paintings, literally paintings of\nmountains (shan) and water (shui), compose poetry\nalluding to the interrelatedness of things, and to direct public works\nprojects meant to maintain the harmony and balance of heaven, earth,\nand humanity.\n\nZhang\u2019s \u201cWestern Inscription\u201d inspired Confucians\nthroughout East Asia to develop philosophical thinking about their\noneness with the natural world and its generative being, and to\nadvance practical thinking about how to respectfully engage with the\nrealm of heaven and earth. In Tokugawa Japan, this environmental\nconcern took many forms. Kaibara Ekken\u2019s Plants of\nJapan (Yamato honz\u014d), a kind of botanical study of\nJapanese medicinal plants and herbs, is one example. In his\nInstructions of Cultivating Life\n(Y\u014dj\u014dkun), Ekken emphasized the importance of\nnourishing one\u2019s ki, or generative force, in harmony\nwith that of all between heaven and earth. Equally important,\nespecially as an indicator of the perennial significance of Zhang\nZai\u2019s \u201cWestern Inscription\u201d is Kumazawa\nBanzan\u2019s (1619\u20131691) \u201cWestern Inscription for\nJapanese\u201d (Yamato nishi no mei), an expansive,\nvernacular commentary on Zhang Zai\u2019s brief text. In his\nQuestions and Answers on the Great Learning (Daigaku\nwakumon), Banzan outlined various policy proposals, including\nlimits on the construction of Buddhist temples and samurai castles, as\na means of preventing deforestation. He also declared mountains,\nforests, and rivers \u2013 metaphors for the natural world \u2013 to\nbe the foundations of the state, and essential components in the\nlongevity of political lines. If a ruler forfeited these components of\nnature and his realm\u2019s balance with the natural world, then his\nline would pay the price. Banzan\u2019s writings reveal that even\nConfucians in the private sector were thinking proactively about\nachieving a sustainable equilibrium with the forces of nature, one\nthat provided for both the best interests of human society and the\nintegrity of natural growth and development.\n5. Confucianism in Modern Japan\n\nAn important legacy of Confucian philosophy in modern Japanese history\nderives from Confucian understandings of the philosophy of history.\nThis is evident in the transition from the Tokugawa period, dominated\npolitically by a samurai regime led by a shogun, to the Meiji period,\nat least billed as a restoration of imperial rule. Rather than\nassuming that history was progressing ever forward to incrementally\nbetter levels, Confucians tended to see ideals in the past. Therefore,\nthey often advocated a return to a supposed golden age as a means to\nimprove conditions in the present. Confucius himself had denied that\nhe was an innovator, insisting that he only sought to transmit the\nideals of the past. Although Confucius might have cast his work as\nmere transmission, he was clearly innovating in revolutionary\nphilosophical ways. The political transformation giving rise to the\nMeiji imperial regime, at least in terms of its philosophical\npresentation as a return to an ancient, supposedly more ideal model,\nwas characteristically Confucian. So was the fact that this purported\nreturn to the past ushered in a profoundly new historical period, one\nthat revolutionized most aspects of life.\n\nOne of the philosophical minds behind the Meiji restoration, at least\ninsofar as several of the anti-Tokugawa, pro-Meiji samurai leaders\nwere concerned, was the Confucian scholar, Yoshida Sh\u014din\n(1830\u20131859). He was a hereditary master, in the Ch\u014dsh\u016b\ndomain, of the Confucian teachings of Yamaga Sok\u014d.\nPhilosophically, Sok\u014d is best known for his Essential Records\nof the Sagely Teachings (Seiky\u014d y\u014droku), a\nbrief but pointed critique of orthodox Neo-Confucian thinking. It\nadvocated instead Sok\u014d\u2019s own understanding of the\nAnalects. As transmitted to Sh\u014din through the Yamaga\nline of scholarship, and then embodied by Sh\u014din\u2019s students\nsuch as It\u014d Hirobumi (1841\u20131909), a Ch\u014dsh\u016b\nrevolutionary turned Meiji statesman, the restorationism that was at\nthe core of both Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism was clearly echoed\nin the spirit of the Meiji restoration.\n\nThe Meiji period, however, soon involved a profound turn away from\ntraditional patterns and toward more distinctively Western ones. This\nwas true in philosophy as well, resulting in the relative atrophy of\nConfucian studies. However, it is significant that most of the Meiji\nleaders who promoted Western philosophical ideas had backgrounds in\nConfucian studies. Nishi Amane (1829\u20131897), often referred to as\nthe father of western philosophy in Japan, read Ogy\u016b\nSorai\u2019s philosophical works before turning to the study of the\nideas of Auguste Comte and John Stuart Mill. During the people\u2019s\nrights movement of the 1870s and early 1880s, advocates such as Nakae\nCh\u014dmin (1847\u20131901) often cast their understandings of\nliberty, equality, and natural rights in terms of notions drawn from\nConfucian discourse.\n\nWith the swing toward conservatism and nationalism in the late-Meiji\nperiod, philosophical voices such as that of Inoue Tetsujir\u014d\nadvocated not so much a faithful return to Confucianism per se but to\nwhat Inoue called kokumin d\u014dtoku, or \u201cnational\nethics.\u201d This set of teachings was based largely on selective\nConfucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety. Inoue is also\nnoteworthy for having led the way, albeit along highly nationalistic\nlines, in interpreting Confucian developments of the early-modern\nperiod as movements in \u201cphilosophy,\u201d using the newly\ncoined Japanese word, tetsugaku. This Japanese word chosen as\nthe gloss for \u201cphilosophy\u201d alluded back to, in Chinese\nliterature, the Book of History, a Confucian classic, where\ntetsu (C: zhi) refers to the \u201cwisdom\u201d\nmanifested by the ancient sages of China. In that respect, the\n\u201cstudy of wisdom,\u201d the literal meaning of\ntetsugaku, was as much an apt characterization of the\nConfucian project as it was one of the western field of\nphilosophy.\n\nUnfortunately, Inoue\u2019s claim that there had been traditional\nforms of philosophy, specifically the Neo-Confucian schools of the\nearly-modern period, well prior to the introduction of western\nphilosophy had one disturbing side effect. He increasingly elevated\nthe status of Confucian notions not necessarily as Confucian notions\nin themselves, but as integral parts of a nationalistic,\nimperialistic, and militaristic blend serving the interests of\nJapanese militarists of the 1930s and 1940s. In particular,\nInoue\u2019s later years were devoted to expounding\nbushid\u014d, the so-called \u201cway of the warrior,\u201d\nas a core ingredient in kokumin d\u014dtoku. Inoue produced\nsuch a large corpus of bushid\u014d-related literature that\none might claim that the way of the warrior was far more his invention\nthan something grounded in tradition.\n\nWith the defeat of Japan in 1945, Confucian notions came to be\nregarded negatively because of their unfortunate appropriation by\nInoue and other philosopher-ideologues. They had manipulated the core\nethics of Confucian philosophy into a teaching of loyalty to the\nimperial state and self-sacrifice for the sake of its glory. Those\nConfucian philosophers whose writings had been most enthusiastic about\nJapan, and so easily appropriated \u2013 as was the case with Yamaga\nSok\u014d who had argued at one point in his multifaceted\nphilosophical corpus, that Japan, not China, was the true Central\nKingdom \u2013 have consequently suffered from significant neglect in\nthe postwar period. By contrast, those earlier Confucians whose\nwritings had disparaged Japan and celebrated China, such as those of\nOgy\u016b Sorai, rebounded from their former pariah status in\njingoistic Japan to becoming the focus of repeated postwar studies.\nUsually, however, because of the overall feeling that Confucianism of\nany sort was more ideology than philosophy (and this was surely the\nmost egregious legacy of its prewar appropriation) Confucianism has\nmost frequently been interpreted simply as \u201cthought\u201d\n(shis\u014d) or \u201cideology\u201d (ideorogii),\ntypically of a \u201cfeudalistic\u201d sort. In other countries,\nincluding contemporary China, interpreters are reexamining\nConfucianism as a living philosophy of ongoing significance, but\nJapanese scholars have more viewed it as a historical artifact, not a\nvital philosophy. Instead, philosophy departments in most major\nJapanese universities today continue to define\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d as western philosophy, finding relatively\nlittle place for the study of Confucianism under its rubric.\n\nExaggerating the extent to which the fortunes of Japanese Confucianism\ndeclined in the postwar period, one scholar, Kiri Paramore, in his\nJapanese Confucianism: A Cultural Study, has suggested that\nin Japan, Confucianism ended up becoming taboo, a topic shunned by\nscholars and public intellectuals who would not so much utter the\nword, \u201cConfucianism,\u201d in their writings. As evidence,\nParamore cites the oeuvre of Maruyama Masao, one of the greatest\npolitical thinkers of the mid-twentieth century. One of\nMaruyama\u2019s most widely read works, Studies in the\nIntellectual History of Tokugawa Japan (Nihon shis\u014dshi\nkenky\u016b), had discussed Neo-Confucianism in some detail,\nalbeit in the flawed interpretive framework that Hegel had provided.\nThus, Maruyama saw Neo-Confucianism as antithetical to change, and its\ncontinuative metaphysics linking the natural and ethical spheres, in\nneed of dissolution.\n\nWritten during Japan\u2019s war years, Maruyama identified a\nsuccession of Japanese Confucian scholars, including Ogy\u016b Sorai,\nas vanquishers of the Zhu Xi mode of thought. The latter was, in\nJapan, little more \u2013 according to Maruyama \u2013 than an\nexpression of spiritual slavery to the ossified philosophy of Song\ndynasty China, that of Zhu Xi. The dissolution of the Zhu Xi mode of\nthought credited to Japanese thinkers such as Sorai seemingly echoed\nthe battlefield advances of the imperial Japanese forces in their\nconquest of large swathes of China and East Asia. Even though Maruyama\nwas ideologically opposed to the war, his narrative hardly transcended\nthe war rhetoric of Japanese nationalism in its ascent over China.\nDespite the fact that Maruyama later acknowledged errors and\nmisjudgments in his presentation of Japanese Confucianism, his\nthinking came to be widely deemed as \u201ca starting point\u201d\nfor future studies of the subject. There can be little doubt that as\ntranslated by Mikiso Hane and published by Princeton University Press,\nMaruyama\u2019s Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa\nJapan prompted many students of Japanese thought to renewed\nthinking about Confucianism and its importance in Japanese\nhistory.\n\nParamore claims that in the postwar period, Maruyama soon turned away\nfrom Confucian studies and only rarely used the term,\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d (Juky\u014d). This shunning of the\nnotion supposedly announced a new era in which, according to Paramore,\nConfucianism was \u201ctaboo.\u201d Put differently,\nMaruyama\u2019s avoidance of the term, \u201cConfucianism,\u201d\nestablished the so-called \u201cMaruyama rule\u201d that\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d was not to be broached. However,\nfamiliarity with Maruyama\u2019s oeuvre proves this analysis\nmistaken. After all, well after Studies, Maruyama authored a\nlengthy essay on the Yamazaki Ansai school, \u201cYamazaki\nAnsai\u2019s Learning and the School of Yamazaki Ansai\u201d\n(Ansai gaku to Ansai gakuha). Maruyama\u2019s essay was\npublished in a substantial volume on Ansai\u2019s school, The\nSchool of Yamazaki Ansai (Yamazaki Ansai gakuha) in\n1980. This volume was co-edited by Maruyama himself, and published by\nIwanami shoten as part of its Nihon shis\u014d taikei series.\nIn the essay, Maruyama discusses Confucianism repeatedly, and\nadmittedly, critically. Nevertheless, in discussing Confucianism,\nMaruyama violated the so-called \u201cMaruyama rule\u201d that had\nsupposedly rendered Confucianism taboo. Clearly, Maruyama\u2019s\ncontinued engagement with Confucianism proves that that was hardly the\ncase.\n\nEvidence of the continued vitality of Confucianism within Japanese\nphilosophical discourse is also at the University of Tokyo Center for\nPhilosophy. Since its founding in 2002, UTCP has sought to establish\nitself as an international base for the discussion of philosophical\nproblems. UTCP has also sponsored discussions addressing dimensions of\nConfucianism within Japanese philosophy. In doing so, UTCP has emerged\nas a leader in affirming the notion of \u201cJapanese\nphilosophy\u201d and that of \u201cJapanese Confucian\nphilosophy.\u201d Much the same is true with the recently established\njournal, the Journal of Japanese Philosophy published by the\nState University of New York Press. Along with the longstanding\nefforts of the East-West Center and the University of\nHawai\u2018i\u2019s Department of Philosophy, the UTCP and\nJJP promise to significantly contribute to the revival of\ninterest in Japanese Confucianism and its contributions to Japanese\nphilosophical discourse.\n\nAlong similar lines, the International Association for Japanese\nPhilosophy (IAJP), founded in 2014 by the editors of the Journal of\nJapanese Philosophy, provides opportunities, through regular\nconferences and panels, for discussion of a range of topics and themes\nin Japanese philosophy, including Japanese Confucianism, keeping the\nlatter very much in the mainstream, rather than taboo, going forward.\nRecent calls for \u201cGreen Confucianism,\u201d or an emphasis on\nenvironmentally-oriented dimensions of Confucian tradition that might\nserve as the foundations for an expansion of environmental philosophy\nwithin Japanese philosophical thinking, have also contributed to the\nongoing relevance of the tradition in ways that go well beyond the\nconfines of family morality, ancestor worship, and the basics of\neveryday morality in society and the political sphere. \u201cGreen\nConfucianism\u201d is just one of many possible re-expressions of\nConfucian thinking vis-a-vis the evolving contexts of Japanese\nmodernity that establish the perennial significance of Confucian\ncosmological thinking, alongside its ethical and sociopolitical and\nspiritual teachings.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abe, Yoshio, 1965. <em>Nihon Shushigaku to Ch\u014dsen</em>,\nT\u014dky\u014d: T\u014dky\u014d daigaku shuppansha.", "Ansart, Oliver, 1998. <em>L\u2019empire du rite: La pens\u00e9e\npolitique d\u2019Ogy\u016b Sorai, Japan, 1666\u20131728</em>,\nGeneva: Droz.", "Bellah, Robert, 1985. <em>Tokugawa Religion: The Cultural Roots of\nModern Japan</em>, New York: The Free Press.", "Boot, W.
