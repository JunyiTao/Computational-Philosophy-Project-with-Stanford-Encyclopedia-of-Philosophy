    "main_text": "Sortals and Logic || Logics of sortals\n9. Conclusion\n\nA large number of thoughtful philosophers have believed that the\ncategory of sortal was philosophically significant and this\nis a strong indication that there is something important they are\nattempting to delineate and analyze. In the last two decades cognitive\npsychologists and formal ontologists have applied the term in their\nresearch. However, our dissection of the definitions and discussions\nshow that there are numerous distinctions in question and while these\ndistinctions have significant overlap, they are not identical. It\nremains to be seen whether the sortal/non-sortal distinction marks one\nvery important difference, or numerous less important distinctions\nrelated in complex ways.\n",
