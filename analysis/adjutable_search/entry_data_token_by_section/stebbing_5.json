    "main_text": "Last Work and Legacy\n6. Last Work and Legacy\n\nSoon after the outbreak of war, Stebbing moved to Cambridge as part of\nthe general evacuation of Bedford College. During her last years, her\nwork became increasingly socially and politically engaged, although\nshe herself continued to shun public recognition or any suggestion of\npersonal political activism. In Ideals and Illusions (1941)\nshe urged the importance in all main spheres of life of identifying\nand pursuing specific ideals, and distinguishing these from\npotentially comforting but misleading illusions. She targeted a number\nof what she saw as such dangerous illusions, including both political\nand religious illusions, such as in cases where religion was used to\ncondone or excuse social inequality or injustice. Stebbing struggled\nagainst ill health to finish A Modern Elementary Logic\n(1943), a textbook on logic that was aimed particularly at students\nwho were starting out in their philosophical studies, perhaps without\nthe benefit of philosophical instruction, as would be the case with\nthose serving in the military. Her final philosophical contribution\nwas Men and Moral Principles, delivered as a London School of\nEconomics Hobhouse Memorial Lecture a few months before she died and\npublished posthumously as a pamphlet in 1944. Stebbing defended the\nvalidity of moral discussion and the reality of moral principles,\nbased on humanistic rather than religious credentials. She argued that\nmoral judgments needed to be considered in their full context and on\nan individual basis. Her approach allowed for complete sets of ideals\nto be evaluated and compared in relation to complex real-life\nsituations, but prompted some later criticism that it left her without\nan intellectual basis for her own condemnation of a number of\npolitical systems, including Fascism.\n\nStebbing\u2019s obituaries focused largely on her logical and\nanalytical work. This work is indeed still worth celebrating in its\nown right and on its own terms, particularly in her bringing together\ntraditional and modern logic and in her accounts of the key ideas and\ndoctrines of the Cambridge School of Analysis. Her role as an early\nBritish interpreter and critic of logical positivism and the dialogue\nshe promoted between the two main branches of analytic philosophy are\nalso extremely significant.\n\nSubsequent developments in how language has been studied and discussed\nin both philosophy and linguistics, however, suggest other ways of\nevaluating Stebbing\u2019s legacy and her significance. She combined\nher commitment to formal logic with a belief in the importance of\npractical analysis of everyday texts and as a result in the necessity\nof public engagement by philosophers, in a manner which was at the\ntime rare in academia. She saw no discrepancy between the rigours of\nlogical argument and the requirements of practical problem solving,\nand stressed the need for clarity and transparency in language use. In\nthis, she championed the importance to philosophers of paying\nattention to ordinary language and the varieties of its everyday use\nsomewhat in advance of the rise of \u201cordinary language\nphilosophy\u201d in Oxford after the Second World War.\n\nIn some ways, Stebbing went even further than the most committed\nphilosophers of ordinary language such as Ryle, Austin and Strawson.\nShe did not just argue that philosophers should pay attention to\nordinary language; she illustrated her philosophical writings with a\nwealth of real life examples taken from everyday communicative\ninteractions, including newspaper editorials, political speeches and\nadvertising copy. Mary Warnock comments that Stebbing\u2019s\n\u201cdetermination to find in language both the source and sometimes\nthe solution of traditional philosophical puzzles\u201d was central\nto later developments in ordinary language philosophy, and highlights\nStebbing\u2019s early \u201cunderstanding of the philosophical\nsignificance of this approach, which can properly be described as\nrevolutionary\u201d (1996: 93). Stebbing\u2019s work was recognized\nat the time in this respect. Urmson (1953), in particular, praised her\nassault on Eddington for its insistence on attending to how people\nordinarily use language; \u201csolid\u201d is used to describe\nproperties such as those displayed by a plank of wood, so to describe\na plank as having no solidity is simply nonsensical.\n\nFurther developments in the study of language, more recent in origin\nand associated with the discipline of linguistics rather than that of\nphilosophy, have some striking resonances with Stebbing\u2019s later\nwritings, and suggest a modern re-evaluation of her contribution.\nStebbing became increasingly interested not just in the significance\nand potentialities of everyday language but also in the social and\nideological implications of how it is used in society, particularly by\nthose in authority. A number of branches of recent and present\nlinguistics share this commitment to studying language in context.\nPragmatics, which can trace a direct descent from ordinary language\nphilosophy through figures such as Austin and Grice, considers meaning\nin relation to the intentions, functions and contexts associated with\nthe use of linguistic forms. Sociolinguistics is concerned with social\ninfluences on the use of language and with the effects of language use\non society.\n\nPerhaps the strongest affinities between Stebbing\u2019s work and\ncurrent linguistics are in the area of Critical Discourse Analysis\n(CDA). CDA emerged as an identifiable branch of linguistics during the\nfinal decades of the twentieth century. Its focus is on the close\nanalysis of actual language use to reveal how specific choices made by\nspeakers and writers can introduce ideological assumptions into texts,\noften assumptions that are concealed beneath the surface message of\nthe text. Some of the methodological commitments and objectives of CDA\nare remarkably similar to the things that Stebbing was saying about\nlanguage half a century or more earlier. For instance, CDA most\ncommonly engages with examples of language use sourced from\ncontemporary newspaper articles, advertisements and political\nspeeches. It also has a specific agenda in terms of its intended\neffect, reminiscent of Stebbing\u2019s mission to educated her\nreadership as informed and responsible consumers and voters:\n\n\nCDA aims to make its users aware of, and able to describe and\ndeconstruct, vectors and effects in texts and semiotic materials\ngenerally which might otherwise remain to wield power uncritiqued. In\nthese respects CDA may be a kind of wake-up call, or\nconsciousness-raising, about the coercive or anti-democratizing\neffects of the discourses we live by (Toolan 2002: xxii).\n\n",
