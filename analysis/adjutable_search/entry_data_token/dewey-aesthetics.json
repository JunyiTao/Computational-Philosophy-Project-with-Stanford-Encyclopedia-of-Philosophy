He\nhas also had a great deal of influence in aesthetics and the\nphilosophy of art. His work Art as Experience (1934) is\nregarded by many as one of the most important contributions to this\narea in the twentieth century. The work is especially well-known for\nits full-blown treatment of aesthetic experience.\n\nCritical of attempts to limit aesthetic experience solely to the\ndomain of fine art, Art as Experience has had a high\ninfluence on trends in aesthetic research, which have sought to\nbroaden the scope of the field from the traditional arts to popular\nculture (Shusterman 1992, 2nd edition 2000), the natural\nenvironment (Berleant 1997), and the everyday (Kupfer 1983, Saito\n2007, Stroud 2011, Leddy 2012). The work is also often seen as a key\npart of Dewey\u2019s general late philosophical project, most\nsystematically developed in Experience and Nature (1925), of\nrethinking experience along naturalist lines as an interaction between\nthe organism and its environment as opposed to a discrete sensory unit\nsuch as stimulus, impression, idea, or sense-datum. Instead of\ninvestigating how our senses are in touch with reality and whether\nthey represent it correctly\u2014which Dewey takes to be the frame of\nmodern epistemology\u2014Dewey\u2019s starting point, building on\nhis reading of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, is to look at the\nways in which experience is formed as a part of natural processes to\nwhich the human being is fundamentally tied. For Dewey, aesthetic\nexperience is the highest form of this interaction. It is the phase\nwhen, in Dewey\u2019s often used words, the interaction between the\norganism and the environment reaches a stage of fulfillment. Already\nExperience and Nature includes a chapter on aesthetics the\nthemes of which Dewey went on to develop in much greater depth and\ndetail in Art as Experience some ten years later. Due to the\nhigh value that Dewey places on aesthetic experience, Art as\nExperience has even been regarded as the culminating work of\nDewey\u2019s late philosophical thinking (Alexander 2013).\n", "toc": [{"#EarlForaAest": "1.

Early Forays into Aesthetics\n\nDewey was in his seventies when Art as Experience was\npublished, but also his earlier work contains numerous discussions of\naesthetic related themes, beginning already from his very first book,\nPsychology (1887), in which Dewey discusses aesthetics and\nthe arts at various points. Dewey, for example, emphasizes the\nimportance of rhythm to our psychic lives, both in perception and in\nexpression. The soul tends to express its most intimate states,\nespecially emotion, in rhythmic form. Rhythm is defined as the\nmind\u2019s reduction of variety to unity or its breaking unity into\nvariety. It happens when certain beats are emphasized at regular\nintervals, and it requires that elements be organized temporally,\nthrough the mind being carried back and forth, to form a whole. It is\nnot confined to the arts but is pervasive in our experience of\ntime.\n\nPsychology comes from Dewey\u2019s idealist period, which\nfor example shows up in the book\u2019s treatment of imagination,\naesthetic feeling, and beauty. Dewey distinguishes between different\nforms of imagination, which he defines as intellect embodying ideas in\nparticular images. The highest form of imagination is creative\nimagination, which allows us to penetrate into the hidden meaning of\nthings through finding sensuous forms that are both highly revealing\nand pleasurable. It makes its objects anew through non-mechanical\nseparation and combination. Implicitly following Kant, Dewey holds\nthat creative imagination\u2019s goal is free play of the\nself\u2019s faculties. Its function is to seize meaning and embody it\nin sensuous form to give rise to feeling, thus representing the freely\nactive subjective self.\n\nPart Two of Psychology is devoted to feeling, including, in\nChapter Fifteen, aesthetic feeling. This chapter also deals with fine\nart and taste. Aesthetic feelings characteristically accompany\nperception of \u201cthe ideal value of experience\u201d\n(PS: 267). The mind responds to certain relations to ideals\nthrough feelings of beauty or ugliness. Every content of experience\nhas beauty in it to the extent that it contains an ideal element.\nEchoing recent views on functional beauty, Dewey argues that a train\nengine, for example, is beautiful insofar as it is felt to\nsuccessfully embody its ideal, i.e., its ability to overcome distances\nand bring humans together. The beautiful object requires a sensuous\nmaterial. However, this sensuous material is only important insofar as\nit presents the ideal. Art cannot be purely idealistic in the sense of\nabandoning sensuous material, but it is idealistic in that it uses\nsuch material to promote the appreciation of ideal values of\nexperience. The aesthetic feeling of beauty is universal and not a\nthing of place and time.\n\nThis universality excludes such lower senses as taste and smell from\nthe beautiful. It also excludes the feeling of ownership and any\nreference to external ends. Harmony constitutes beauty. Harmony is\ndefined as the feeling that accompanies agreement of experience with\nthe self\u2019s ideal nature (PS: 273). Art attempts to\nsatisfy the aesthetic in our nature, and it succeeds when it expresses\nthe ideal completely. The idea, in turn, is the \u201ccompletely\ndeveloped self\u201d. So the goal of art is to create the perfectly\nharmonious self. Against this background, Dewey ranks the fine arts\naccording to their level of ideality. Architecture is the least ideal\nart, while poetry is fully ideal, having little that is\nsensuous in it, concentrating as it does on the vital personality of\nman himself (and nature as only a reflection of this).\n\nEspecially outside of philosophical circles, Dewey is best known for\nhis work in education. One of his major works in this area,\nDemocracy and Education (1916), also includes reflections on\naesthetic themes, particularly on the imagination, which Dewey regards\n\u201cas the sole way of escape from mechanical methods in\nteaching\u201d (DE: 245) that he, in general, opposes.\nAnticipating the naturalism of Art as Experience Dewey argues\nthat there is no essential gap between aesthetic experience and other\nforms of experience. The function of the fine arts is not to provide\nan escape from ordinary life. Rather, it is the enhancement of\nqualities that make ordinary experiences appealing. The arts are the\nmain means of achieving \u201can intensified, enhanced\nappreciation\u201d (DE: 246). Their purpose, beyond being\nenjoyable, is that they fix taste, reveal depth of meaning in\notherwise mediocre experiences, and concentrate and focus elements of\nwhat is considered good. In the end the fine arts are \u201cnot\nluxuries of education, but emphatic expressions of that which makes\nany education worthwhile\u201d (DE: 247). Dewey is also\ncritical of the Aristotelian distinction between useful labor and\nleisure, where the second is privileged over the first, and believes\nthis prejudicial distinction is still dominant. He comes back to this\nissue in Art as Experience, where he suggests a new\nunderstanding of the relationship between means and ends as a way of\nimproving the quality of people\u2019s daily experience. Means should\nnot be seen as mere disposable preliminary stages, which can be thrown\naway like a ladder once the end is reached, but as integral parts of\nthe ends that they help to fulfill. This reversal, Dewey believes,\nwill infuse people\u2019s everyday experience with a sense of\ndirection and meaning.\n\nThe essay Reconstruction in Philosophy, published in 1920,\nconcludes with a view of an ideal future in which ideas are deepened\nbecause they are expressed in imaginative vision and fine art.\nReligious and scientific values will be reconciled and art will no\nlonger be a mere luxury or a stranger to everyday life. Making a\nliving will be making a life worth living, and the hardness of\ncontemporary life will be bathed in a new light.\n\nDewey returned briefly to issues of the role of art in society in\nThe Public and its Problems (1927), where art is seen as\nsomething that can resolve the problem of dissemination of ideas\nappropriate for social change. Artists are the real purveyors of news\ninsofar as they cause happenings to kindle emotion and perception. For\nDewey, Walt Whitman was the exemplar of such an artist. He concludes\nthat for a great community and a real public to come into being an art\nof \u201cfull and moving communication\u201d must take possession of\nour mechanized world (PP: 350).\n\nIn \u201cQualitative Thought\u201d, which appears in Philosophy\nand Civilization (1931), Dewey says some things that anticipate\nsome of the moves he makes in Art as Experience. For example,\nhe argues that there is a \u201clogic of artistic construction\u201d\nand that refusal to admit this is a sign of breakdown of traditional\nlogic. When a work of art does not hold together so that the quality\nof one part reinforces and expands the qualities of the other parts it\nfails. Works that are genuine intellectual and logical wholes have an\nunderlying quality that defines them and that controls the\nartist\u2019s thinking. The logic of such an artist is the logic of\nqualitative thinking.\n2. Art as Experience\n\nAs much as there is fascinating preliminary material in his earlier\nwritings, Art as Experience raises Dewey\u2019s theorizing\nabout aesthetics and art to a new level. Not only is the density of\nthought and insight in the later work greater, but the understanding\nof the arts that it is built on is much more sophisticated compared to\nthe earlier investigations. An important event that significantly\ncontributed to the development of Dewey\u2019s aesthetic thinking was\nhis collaboration with the industrialist and art collector Albert C.\nBarnes to whom Art as Experience is dedicated. Dewey was a\nmember of the staff of the Barnes Foundation of which he was named\ndirector in 1925. Not only does Dewey quote at length from\nBarnes\u2019 writings on painting, but also many of the art examples\nin Dewey\u2019s book came from his friend\u2019s impressive art\ncollection. One of the focus points of the Barnes collection is early\nmodernist painting, and Art as Experience includes numerous\nexaminations of the paintings by the leading figures of early\nmodernism, particularly Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, August\nRenoir, and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\nArt as Experience forms a systematic aesthetic theory in a\nsimilar sense to such classics of twentieth century aesthetics as\nRobin George Collingwood\u2019s Principles of Art, Martin\nHeidegger\u2019s The Origins of the Work of Art, Theodor\nAdorno\u2019s Aesthetic Theory, and Monroe Beardsley\u2019s\nAesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism. It is a\nfar more important source of inspiration and target of criticism\ncompared to Dewey\u2019s earlier texts. The following six sections\ntake a look at the main themes of Art as Experience, all of\nwhich are, in some way or another, connected to aesthetic\nexperience.\n2.1 The Naturalistic Roots of Aesthetic Theory\n\nThe aesthetic theory that Dewey develops in Art as Experience\ncould be labeled moderately naturalist. While Dewey locates the\n\u201cactive seeds\u201d of art and other aesthetic phenomena in\nnatural processes (AE: 18), he in no way seeks to reduce them\nto natural reality nor does he try to explain their origins and\nperseverance by locating a place for them in the development of the\nhuman species, as some contemporary forms of evolutionary aesthetics\ndo. Rather, Dewey\u2019s naturalism is of an emergent sort, in the\nsense that he seeks to show how aesthetic experience and culture\nemerge from the natural basis of life, as he understands it (Alexander\n2013). The key element of this moderate naturalism is the idea of an\norganism, or of \u201cthe live creature\u201d\u2014a term that\nDewey also often uses\u2014which is in a constant interaction with\nits surrounding world. Dewey argues that this interaction is marked by\nshifting and reinforcing phases of disarray and stability, of\nunsettlement and restoration of harmony, which, in Dewey\u2019s view,\ngive experience its basic structure. As Dewey explains in an\noft-quoted passage, \n\n\nlife goes on in an environment; not merely in it but because\nof it, through interaction with it. (AE: 19, italics in the\noriginal) \n\n\nNot surprisingly, Dewey\u2019s conception of experience, upon which\nhis aesthetics is built, has been described as\n\u201cecological\u201d (Hildebrand 2008).\n\nIn line with his naturalism, Dewey is highly critical of attempts to\nidealize art and the aesthetic away from \u201cthe objects of\nconcrete experience\u201d (AE: 17), as well as of the\naspiration to explain art\u2019s value by its supposed capacity to\ndisclose some higher forms of reality from the natural one we share\nwith other animals. For Dewey, this kind of spiritual take on art is\nyet another example of the human ambition to build permanence within\nthe constantly changing and unpredictable natural world. He traces the\norigins of many influential dualisms, for example between \u201chigh\nand low\u201d and \u201cmaterial and ideal\u201d, as well as\n\u201cthe contempt for the body\u201d and \u201cthe fear of the\nsenses\u201d, to this more fundamental dualism between spirit and\nnature (AE: 26). Already in Experience and Nature,\nDewey argues that there are but two alternatives, \n\n\neither art is a continuation\u2026 of natural tendencies of natural\nevents; or art is a peculiar addition to nature springing from\nsomething dwelling exclusively in the breast of man, whatever name be\ngiven to the latter. (EN: 291) \n\n\nHe favors the first alternative and takes the movement between\ninstability and stability, activity and passivity, doing and\nundergoing that he thinks are intrinsic qualities of all experience as\nthe starting points of his aesthetic theorizing. Dewey: \n\n\nThese biological commonplaces are something more than that; they reach\nto the roots of the esthetic in experience. (AE: 20)\n\n\nWhile Dewey promotes a naturalistic starting point for aesthetic\ntheory, he is equally aware of the negative connotations which have\noften been attached to naturalist understandings of art and the\naesthetic, and the scale of the transformation that the rapid\ndevelopment of the natural sciences had on people\u2019s sense of\nthemselves. For physical science seemed to strip \n\n\nits objects of the qualities that give the objects and scenes of\nordinary experience all their poignancy and preciousness.\n(AE: 341) \n\n\nHowever, Dewey finds these worries unfounded. A naturalist aesthetics,\nwhich fully recognizes \u201cthe continuity of the organs, needs and\nbasic impulses of the human creature with his animal forebears\u201d,\ndoes not imply a \u201cnecessary reduction of man to the level of\nbrutes\u201d. Rather only a naturalist approach can properly account\nfor the nearly miraculous fact that something as complex and\n\u201cmarvelous\u201d as art and aesthetic experience can emerge\nfrom the most basic units of life (AE: 28).\n\nThe goal of aesthetic theory, in Dewey\u2019s view, should not,\ntherefore, be to spiritualize works of art and to set them apart from\nthe objects of ordinary experience, but to disclose the \u201cway in\nwhich these works idealize qualities found in common\nexperience\u201d. (AE: 17) It is in other words wrong to\nthink of the aesthetic as a luxurious or transcendentally ideal\n\u201cintruder in experience from without\u201d. Rather, the\naesthetic in experience should be understood as \u201cthe clarified\nand intensified development of traits that belong to every normally\ncomplete experience\u201d. Precisely this kind of naturalist approach\nrepresents for Dewey \u201cthe only secure basis upon which esthetic\ntheory can be built\u201d (AE: 52\u201353).\n2.2 Against \u201cThe Museum Conception of Art\u201d\n\nDewey\u2019s critique of a position that he calls \u201cthe museum\nconception of art\u201d is one of the most famous parts of his\naesthetic theory. It is for him a textbook example of the kind of\ncompartmentalizing attitude toward art which his naturalism seeks to\novercome. In Dewey\u2019s rendering, the museum conception of art by\nand large corresponds to the modern idea of fine art which emerged in\nthe eighteenth century and which received its most theoretically\ndeveloped account in Charles Batteux\u2019s The Fine Arts Reduced\nto a Single Principle (Les Beaux Arts r\u00e9duits \u00e1\nun m\u00eame principe, 1746). Around this time, the different\narts were gradually seen to form a unified group separate from the\nsciences, religion, and most importantly from the practical arts. The\nidea of the autonomy of art surfaced. Art was considered a\nself-regulating field for which the different art institutions, which\nwere emerging simultaneously, provided a setting. As opposed to the\npractical arts, such as embroidery and shoe making, whose value\ndepended on the external goals they served, the fine arts were\nconsidered to have their own intrinsic measures of value, which could,\nmoreover, be realized in full only within the spaces of the developing\nart institutions.\n\nThe museum conception also represents a more general tendency Dewey\nsees in philosophical theory, \u201cthe philosophical fallacy\u201d.\nWith this term Dewey refers to a set of preconceptions underlying\ninquiry which frame research and guide its progress before any\nconscious inquiry has even taken place. In aesthetics, the fallacy\nhas, in Dewey\u2019s view, taken the form that art and the aesthetic\nmust necessarily be something separate from ordinary everyday\nmodes of experience and activity. This is an assumption to which any\naesthetic inquiry must fit itself. As in other fields of philosophy,\nthe cure to the fallacy in the case of aesthetics is to look at\nexperience more carefully, in particular at the ways in which\naesthetic experience emerges from the common patterns of all\nexperience, which Dewey\u2019s naturalism examines.\n\nDewey thinks there are historic reasons why the idea of art as\nsomething essentially autonomous from other areas of life became so\ndominant. He traces these back to the rise of nationalism and\ncapitalism. Both of these developments, in his view, reinforced the\ninclination to set art \u201cupon a remote pedestal\u201d apart from\nother activities and modes of experience (AE: 11). The\nconception of art connected to nationalist and imperialist tendencies\nrendered museums into \u201cthe beauty parlor[s] of\ncivilization\u201d, (AE: 346) where each nation exhibited\nits greatest artistic achievements and, as in some cases, also its\nartistic loot. Artworks received \u201ca holier-than-thou\u201d\naura, which reinforced their esoteric character as something opposed\nto everyday life (AE: 15). Dewey also refers, in an unusually\nspiteful tone, to \u201cthe nouveaux riches\u201d of his time, whom\nhe thinks collected expensive artworks merely for the sake of\nbuttressing their social statuses with little care for their artistic\nvalue and for engaging with them aesthetically. All this meant for\nDewey that works of art were in danger of becoming mere stale\n\u201cart products\u201d instead of artworks that actually\ndo something \u201cwith and in experience\u201d (AE:\n9).\n\nDewey believes that there have been no winners in this development:\nart is concealed or \u201cwrapped\u201d, to follow the terminology\nof contemporary Deweyan, Richard Shusterman (Shusterman 1992), in a\nrealm of its own separate from people\u2019s everyday needs, values,\nand attitudes. To achieve a genuine aesthetic experience required\nleaving this everyday package behind and entering the confined\nsettings of the museum and other institutions of art. In Dewey\u2019s\nview, the resulting discrepancy between aesthetics and more mundane\nareas of life is not restricted to theory. It has \u201cdeeply\u201d\naffected \n\n\nthe practice of living, driving away esthetic perceptions that are\nnecessary ingredients of happiness, or reducing them to the level of\ncompensating transient pleasurable excitations. (AE: 16) \n\n\nThe result has been an \u201cesoteric idea of fine art\u201d\n(AE: 90) and a conception of the everyday as something\ninherently unaesthetic.\n\nThe many examples of non-Western art Dewey discusses in Art as\nExperience are especially important parts of his argument for\nrestoring the continuity between art and life, releasing it from the\nyoke of the museum conception of art. For the ways aesthetic practices\nand artifacts are incorporated into the very center of daily life and\ncommon rituals in many such cultures show that aesthetically\nsignificant objects do not require any special institutional setting.\nAccording to Dewey, such everyday objects as \u201cdomestic utensils,\nfurnishings of tent and house, rugs, mats, jars, pots, bows,\nspears\u201d were essential parts of the life of a community and had\na key role for example in \n\n\nthe worship of gods, feasting and fasting, fighting, hunting, and all\nthe rhythmic crises that punctuate the stream of living. (AE:\n14) \n\n\nArt then for Dewey is a far older phenomenon than the modern concept\nof fine art; it has its origins already in the world of \u201carchaic\nman\u201d and should be seen as \n\n\nan extension of the power of rites and ceremonies to unite men,\nthrough a shared celebration, to all incidents and scenes of life.\n(AE: 275).\n\n2.3 Aesthetic Experience\n\nWhat, then, is an aesthetic experience for Dewey? His account can be\nregarded as a form of \u201cinternalism\u201d, in that it seeks to\nseparate aesthetic experience from other types of experience by\nlooking at its internal qualities, that is, at what aesthetic\nexperience feels like from the inside (Shelley 2009 [2017]).\n\nAesthetic experience marks for Dewey a unique experience, which shows\nwhat experience at its best can be in all quarters of life, not just\nin art; \u201cesthetic experience is experience in its\nintegrity\u201d (AE: 278). It is a distinctive kind of\nexperiential condensation within the general stream of experience. It\nis the most important specimen of a form of experience that Dewey\nterms \u201can experience\u201d, often italicizing the\nindefinite article of this concept to emphasize the standout character\nof the referred experience. In \u201can experience\u201d\nthe material of experience is fulfilled, consummated, and forms an\nintegral whole, as for example, when a game is played through, a\nconversation is rounded out or when we finish \u201cthat meal in a\nParis restaurant\u201d (AE: 43).\n\nDewey never puts forth an explicit definition of aesthetic experience\nin terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. However, certain\nfeatures recur in his numerous discussions. Most importantly,\naesthetic experience has a temporal structure. Aesthetic experience is\nsomething that develops and attains specific qualities as the\nexperience proceeds. It is in this sense \u201cdynamic because it\ntakes time to complete\u201d (AE: 62). To qualify as an\naesthetic experience, there must, moreover, be accumulation\nbetween the different phases of the experience: aesthetic experience\nincludes a sense that the later phases build on earlier ones and carry\nthem further rather than just mechanically following them. Aesthetic\nexperiences are also intensive; they condense, for example,\nemotional and formal features to a single experience. Another key\nquality of aesthetic experience is a feeling of resistance.\nThese resistances are not obstacles: they feed the experience\u2019s\ndevelopment and accumulation and are converted into movement toward a\nclose. In aesthetic experience, the experiencer is also overcome by a\nsense of rhythm. Aesthetic experience has an internal\nmomentum and, already from the initial phases, the\nexperiencer can feel a sense of direction in it. In other\nwords, in an aesthetic experience \u201cevery successive part flows\nfreely, without seam and without unfilled blanks, into what\nensues\u201d. Moreover, \u201cas one part leads to another and as\none part carries on what went before, each gains distinctness in\nitself\u201d (AE: 43). Aesthetic experience also does not\nterminate at some random point. Rather, its close is a summation of\nits earlier phases, either in the sense that the energy that has\ngathered up during the experience is released or the experience\nreaches a fulfillment in some other sense. In short,\naesthetic experience involves \u201cinception, development, and\nfulfillment\u201d (AE: 62).\n\nFrom a Deweyan viewpoint, aesthetic experience, then, has roughly the\nfollowing structure. The experience is set off by some factors, such\nas opening a book, directing a first glance at a painting, beginning\nto listen to a piece of music, entering a natural environment or a\nbuilding, or beginning a meal or a conversation. As aesthetic\nexperience is temporal, the material of the experience does not remain\nunchanged, but the elements initiating the experience, like reading\nthe first lines of a book or hearing the first chord of a symphony,\nmerge into new ones as the experience proceeds and complex\nrelationships are formed between its past and newer phases. When these\ndifferent parts form a distinctive kind of orderly developing unity\nthat stands out from the general experiential stream of our lives, the\nexperience in question is aesthetic.\n\nDewey contrasts aesthetic to \u201cinchoate\u201d and\n\u201canesthetic\u201d experiences. These experiences, too, have a\ntemporal dimension, but instead of exhibiting the unified development\nas an aesthetic experience, they include \u201choles\u201d,\n\u201cmechanical junctions\u201d, and \u201cdead centres\u201d\n(AE: 43). The different phases of the experience merely\nfollow each other, but in no way develop or build on the earlier\nphases. There is no sense of the kind of \u201ccontinuous\nmerging\u201d that characterizes aesthetic experience. Due to their\npunctured and mechanical quality, inchoate and anesthetic experiences\nalso lack the ordered development that is a condition of an\nexperience\u2019s aesthetic fulfillment. The anesthetic experience is\na function either of loose succession or mechanical connection of\nparts. As Dewey explains,\n\n\nThings happen, but they are neither definitely included nor decisively\nexcluded; we drift\u2026 There are beginnings and cessations, but no\ngenuine initiations and concludings. One thing replaces another, but\ndoes not absorb it, carry it on. There is experience, but so slack and\ndiscursive that it is not an experience. (AE:\n46\u201347)\n\n\nGiven the general character of aesthetic experience, it is no surprise\nthat Dewey attributes such high significance to it in his late\nnaturalist philosophy. Aesthetic experience shows how complex and\nmeaningful the experiences which emerge from the basic factors of all\ninteraction\u2014sense of direction, resistance, rhythm,\naccumulation\u2014can be. Dewey\u2019s aesthetic theory is\nnaturalist precisely in the sense that even an experience as complex\nas aesthetic experience is seen as continuous with the interaction\nthat he believes characterizes the relationship of even the simplest\nbiological organisms to their environments. Similarly, art is only one\nof the many practices and areas of life which can be sources of\naesthetic experience. Conversation, for example, is one such everyday\nactivity, for it can exhibit the kind of \u201ccontinuous interchange\nand blending\u201d which Dewey thinks is essential to aesthetic\nexperience (AE: 43).\n\nDewey also argues that there is no reason to think of such conceptual\ncategories as \u201cthe practical\u201d or \u201cthe\nintellectual\u201d as some way contradictory to the supposedly pure\nand non-utilitarian category of \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d. It is\npossible to have aesthetic experiences while engaging with practical\nand intellectual activities. The aesthetic status of the experiences\nhad in these connections, again, depends solely on the\nexperiences\u2019 internal qualities; even \u201ca mechanic\u201d\nand \u201ca surgeon\u201d can be \u201cartistically engaged\u201d\nin Dewey\u2019s sense (AE: 11, 103). The practical and the\nintellectual should not, thereby, be considered \u201cthe enemies of\nthe esthetic\u201d: the real enemies are \n\n\nthe humdrum; slackness of loose ends; submission to convention in\npractice and intellectual procedure. (AE: 47) \n\n\nAesthetic experience, in fact, is something that precisely ties the\npractical, the emotional, and the intellectual into \u201ca single\nwhole\u201d (AE: 61). Upon reflection it is in many cases\npossible to disentangle these different strands, but in the moment of\nexperience they are all active in constituting aesthetic experience\nfor the whole that it is.\n\nDewey\u2019s description of aesthetic experience as a process of both\ndoing and undergoing is still worth noting, as it appears widely in\nthe commentary literature. With this conceptual pair, Dewey draws\nattention to the kind of interplay between activity and passivity that\nhe thinks aesthetic experience involves. The development of an\naesthetic experience often requires effort and imaginative activity\nfrom the experiencer, but these moments of doing are also joined with\nphases when the object or the environment is felt to take the lead in\nthe experience without any real sense of doing from the experiencer.\nUndergoing is the receptive phase of the experience, the taking in of\nenergy, which the experiencer can, then, more consciously work on. A\nbalance between these experiential phases represents for Dewey an\nideal of all experience and, again, aesthetic experience becomes an\nacute expression of the potentialities that Dewey believes are\ninherent in the basic interaction between the live creature and its\nenvironment; \n\n\nart, in its form, unites the very same relation of doing and\nundergoing, outgoing and incoming energy, that makes an experience to\nbe an experience. (AE: 54)\n\n\nThe concepts of doing and undergoing also lead Dewey to emphasize the\nsimilarities between the work of an artist and the undertakings\nrequired from the audience of art. The final artwork is, among other\nthings, the result of planning, choosing, highlighting, clarifying,\nsimplifying, and other ways of organizing and reorganizing material.\nIn Dewey\u2019s view, the experiencer does not just take in\n\u201cwhat is there in finished form\u201d: he or she should achieve\na sense of the possibilities and challenges that the artist faced in\nher work, as well as the decisions she took out of which the work grew\nto its finished form. Both the making of art and experiencing of art\nare, thereby, \n\n\nprocess[es] consisting of a series of responsive acts that accumulate\ntoward objective fulfillment. (AE: 58) \n\n\nIn this sense, aesthetic experience is for Dewey a kind of mirror\nimage of the artist\u2019s activities. It means \u201c[the]\nrecreation of the object\u201d (AE: 60). \n2.4 Aesthetic Form\n\nAs internalist as Dewey\u2019s approach to aesthetic experience is,\nand as much as he emphasizes the distinction between an art product as\na physical thing and the artwork as an experienced thing, Dewey also\npresents a detailed examination of the formal features of aesthetic\nobjects similar to those carried out by numerous other philosophers of\nart. Dewey states that aesthetic experience has \u201cobjective\nconditions\u201d (AE: 68): not all objects and environments\ninspire the kind of interaction that he thinks constitutes an\naesthetic experience. His analysis of \u201caesthetic form\u201d is\nan attempt to capture these conditions. Similarly to his understanding\nof aesthetic experience as dynamic and developing rather than as a\nclear-cut sense perception, Dewey seeks to bring out the livelier\nsides of form. Aesthetic form is something that \u201cenhance[s],\nprolong[s] and purif[ies] perceptual experience\u201d (EN:\n292).\n\nOn a basic level, by form Dewey means the thing that \u201corganizes\nmaterial into the matter of art\u201d (AE: 139). Form is\nconstituted by the different parts of the aesthetic object and by\ntheir relationships to one another. For Dewey, the parts of aesthetic\nform are not independent units. Rather, relationship is\n\u201csomething direct and active\u2026 dynamic and\nenergetic\u201d (AE: 139). With his conception of form,\nDewey draws attention to \n\n\nthe way things bear upon one another, their clashes and unitings, the\nway they fulfill and frustrate, promote and retard, excite and inhibit\none another. (AE: 139) \n\n\nIn the case of aesthetic form, the different parts of the object must\nadjust themselves as parts of the same object. The individual parts\nhave a functional and active role in the whole of which they are a\npart.\n\nThis also means that perception of aesthetic form is not a matter of\nunrelated singular perceptions, but it is \u201cserial\u201d, in\nthat \u201ceach sequential act builds up and reinforces what went\nbefore\u201d (AE: 136). According to Dewey, aesthetic form\npossess \u201cqualitative unity\u201d which can be immediately felt.\nA fuller aesthetic experience, nevertheless, requires engaging with\nthe form\u2019s organization precisely in the sense of serial\nperception. (AE: 141) Against this background, Dewey calls\ninto question the traditional distinction between the arts of time\n(music, theater, dance) and the arts of space (painting, sculpture,\narchitecture). Even the spatial arts include important temporal\ndimensions and have to be \u201cperceived by accumulative series of\ninteractions\u201d (AE: 223). Through this sort of serial\nand cumulating engagement the aesthetic object gradually builds up for\nthe experiencer. This, according to Dewey, is especially the case with\nthe supposedly static art of architecture:\n\n\n[Even] a small hut cannot be the matter of esthetic perception save as\ntemporal qualities enter in. A cathedral\u2026 makes an\ninstantaneous impression\u2026 But this is only the substratum and\nframework within which a continuous process of interactions introduces\nenriching and defining elements\u2026 One must move about, within\nand without, and through repeated visits let the structure gradually\nyield itself\u2026 in various lights and in connection with changing\nmoods. (AE: 224)\n\n\nIf aesthetic experience has objective conditions, aesthetic form, in\nturn, has a set of \u201cformal conditions\u201d, which are\n\u201ccontinuity, cumulation, conservation, tension and\nanticipation\u201d (AE: 143). Dewey draws special attention\nto the factor of resistance. It is a kind of condition of conditions,\nfor \u201cwithout internal tension\u201d experience of form would be\njust \u201ca fluid rush to a straightaway mark\u201d in which case\nthere \u201ccould be [nothing] called development and\nfulfillment\u201d (AE: 143). Dewey further specifies the\nrelationship between aesthetic form and aesthetic experience:\n\n\n[T]here can be no esthetic experience apart from an object\u2026 for\nan object to be the content of esthetic appreciation it must\nsatisfy those objective conditions without which cumulation,\nconservation, reenforcement, transition into something more complete,\nare impossible. (AE: 151, italics in the original)\n\n\nThe naturalist underpinnings of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics are apparent\nalso in his analysis of aesthetic form, for its conditions are\nobjective precisely in the sense that they belong \u201cto the world\nof physical materials and energies\u201d (AE: 151). His\nnaturalism, thereby, locates the origins of aesthetic form \u201cdeep\nin the world itself\u201d (AE: 152).\n\nOne of these deep conditions of aesthetic form is rhythm. Dewey finds\nrhythm \u201cthe first characteristic of the environing world that\nmakes possible the existence of artistic form\u201d (AE:\n147). The rhythms of art are grounded in the basic patterns of the\nrelation of the live creature and its environment. Dewey opposes the\ntheory of rhythm as the steady recurrence of identical elements as in\na ticking clock: \u201cthe tick-tock theory\u201d of rhythm\n(AE: 168). Rather, each rhythmic beat or tick does not merely\nrepeat the past but drives the rhythmic process forward. Various\nnatural phenomena exemplify this type of rhythm, including \u201ca\npond moving in ripples, forked lightning [and] the waving of branches\nin the wind\u201d (AE: 159). These are contrasted to\nrhythmless phenomena, such as \u201ca monotonous roar\u201d\n(AE: 159), which do not involve mutually resisting forces and\nthus do not entail a gathering up of energy which would create an\nanticipation of release, as in the case of the beating of a\nbird\u2019s wing. Neither do these wholes possess the kind of\naccumulation that Dewey finds essential to aesthetic form.\n\nWhat this all means is that the recurrence typical to aesthetic form\nshould not be understood \u201cstatistically\u201d or\n\u201canatomically\u201d, but functionally. In the case of aesthetic\nform, rhythm is something that furthers experience (AE: 171).\nThe beating of a bird\u2019s wing is a good example: it marks the\nrelease of energy, but at the same time the beginning of a new\naccumulation of energy, which again discharges in a new beating of the\nwing and so on. Dewey finds this form of rhythm \n\n\nwhenever each step forward is at the same time a summing up and\nfulfillment of what precedes, and every consummation carries\nexpectation tensely forward. (AE: 177) \n\n\nWhile Dewey admits that rhythm can be most easily associated with\nmusic, he thinks it, in the end, cuts across the arts, to embrace even\npainting and architecture: \n\n\ndenial of rhythm to pictures, edifices, and statues, or the assertion\nthat it is found in them only metaphorically, rests upon ignorance of\nthe inherent nature of every perception. (AE: 180) \n\n\nAgain, the distinction between the spatial and the temporal arts turns\nout overly strict. Perception of rhythm in pictures is as essential to\ntheir experience as it is to the experience of music.\n2.5 Expression\n\nAnother central question of aesthetics that Dewey considers at length\nin Art as Experience is artistic expression. How can an\nartwork be expressive and serve as means of communication? The issues\nare intertwined, for Dewey believes \u201cobjects of art\u2026\ncommunicate\u201d because they are \u201cexpressive\u201d\n(AE: 110). Artistic expression is for Dewey not a simple\nmatter of the artist transmitting her inner emotions to the work. When\nfor example Van Gogh tried to express \u201cutter desolation\u201d\nin one of his paintings he did not \u201cpour forth\u201d an emotion\nto the artwork, but selected and organized material, such as paint and\npigments, in a certain way to capture this emotional tone, turning the\nmaterial used into means of expression, or a medium in Dewey\u2019s\nterminology.\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s explanation, the expressive act is set off by\n\u201can impulsion\u201d, a state of unsettlement in the organism,\nwhich creates a need to restore a state of balance. Impulsion, as\ndistinguished from \u201cimpulse\u201d, is a developmental movement\nof the \u201cwhole organism\u201d in response to a need arising from\ninteraction with the environment, for example a craving for food\n(AE: 64). It is the beginning stage of a complete experience,\nwhereas impulse is momentary, for example a tongue reacting to a sour\ntaste. Impulsion leads to reflection on the possible means and actions\nfor restoring a state of harmony and a decision to act accordingly,\nlike in the case of finding some water to satisfy one\u2019s thirst.\nThe reflective movement caused by the impulsion also makes the\ncreature more aware of itself. \u201cBlind surge\u201d turns into\n\u201ca purpose\u201d and \u201cthe resistance\u201d the creature\nfaces when trying to complete the impulsion \u201ccalls out\nthought\u201d and \u201cgenerates curiosity\u201d (AE:\n65). The act of expression involves similar mental undertakings, which\nprecisely makes the emotive impetus behind expression closer to an\nimpulsion than a reflexive type impulse. It is as if something\nrequires squeezing out or pressing forth, that is expression\n(AE: 70). Out of this expression the expressive object\ngradually takes shape.\n\nAnother important distinction is between an expression and a discharge\nof emotion. All expression involves discharge, but only a particular\nkind of discharge counts as expression. Dewey insists that someone who\nsimply acts angrily is not expressing anger. Mere \u201cgiving\nway\u201d to impulsion does not constitute expression. The goal of\nexpression is not to get rid of the initial emotion, as is the case\nwith screams that merely discharge emotion, but to achieve a clearer\nsense of its content and significance. For Dewey, expression means\n\u201cto stay by, to carry forward in development, to work out to\ncompletion\u201d (AE: 67\u201368). For an emotional\ndischarge to turn into expression in Dewey\u2019s sense also requires\nan external channel for releasing and working on the emotive energy of\nthe background impulsion. Dewey writes: \n\n\nwhere there is no administration of objective conditions, no shaping\nof materials in the interest of embodying the excitement, there is no\nexpression. (AE: 68) \n\n\nThe expressive object is the embodiment of this expressive act.\n\nWhat also separates expression from an action caused by a mere impulse\nis that expression has a medium. For example, a crying baby does not,\nin Dewey\u2019s view, use the cry to express her emotions; the cry is\njust an ulterior sign of dissatisfaction. However, when the smile and\nthe outreached hand, for example, are used to express the joy of\nseeing a friend, these bodily movements function as media for\nexpressing joy. Whether something counts as a medium of expression or\nnot thus \u201cdepends upon the way in which material is used\u201d\n(AE: 69). When the artist works on an expressive object based\non her initial impulsion, the materials of art\u2014pigments, clays,\nnotes, words\u2014turn into media of expression.\n\nSome of Dewey\u2019s formulations on the artistic medium come close\nto the so-called medium-specificity claim according to which each of\nthe arts has its own specific medium that gives a kind of internal\nground mechanism for the art\u2019s potencies and development;\n\u201ccolor does something in experience and sound something\nelse\u201d (AE: 230). Different artistic media are,\naccording to Dewey, suited for different expressive ends in the sense\nthat \n\n\nevery medium has its own power, active and passive, outgoing and\nreceptive, and\u2026 the basis for distinguishing the different\ntraits of the arts is their exploitation of the energy that is\ncharacteristic of the material used as a medium. (AE: 248)\n\n\n\nAesthetic effects, thereby, attach to their medium.\n\nFor Dewey, expression is also not a matter of finding an outer form to\nan already complete emotion. Emotions, in Dewey\u2019s sense, do not\ncome in ready-made form, but are more like processes. Especially the\nemotive impulsion behind expression initially lacks a clear-cut\ncontent. We might be overcome by a certain emotion but might also be\nunable to immediately grasp its ultimate content and why we feel the\nway we do. Dewey compares the position the emotive impulsion has in\nartistic expression to a magnet that draws in certain material while\nrejecting others. The impulsion constitutes a kind of gathering\nprinciple of the artist\u2019s work, for example explaining her\nchoice of material and ways of using and working on them (AE:\n75). In Dewey\u2019s view, the act of expression is driven by the\neffort to find an appropriate fit between the impulsion and the outer\nmaterial and involves a constant monitoring of the impact that the\nartistic decisions have on the development of the initial impulsion.\nDo they, for example, feed it, clarify it, or obscure it? In other\nwords, \u201cemotional energy\u201d does \u201creal work\u201d in\nthe build-up of artistic expression leading to the expressive object\nas it \n\n\nevokes, assembles, accepts, and rejects memories, images,\nobservations, and works them into a whole. (AE: 160) \n\n\nThis is why Dewey emphasizes that in artistic expression it is not\njust the external materials of marble, pigment, and words that undergo\na change. Similar changes occur \u201con the side of\n\u2018inner\u2019 materials\u201d, such as \u201cimages,\nobservations, memories and emotions\u201d; in the development of the\nexpressive act they too receive a new form and structure (AE:\n81).\n\nFrom a Deweyan viewpoint, expression then means processing external\nmaterial \u201cthrough the alembic of personal experience\u201d.\nHowever, the material itself belongs to \u201cthe common world and so\nhas qualities in common with the material of other experiences\u201d.\nExpression thereby organically connects \u201ca personal act\u201d\nand an \u201cobjective result\u201d (AE: 88). The fact that\nin expression the artist\u2019s personal experience is mediated\nthrough objective material opens the possibility for the audience to\nshare the artist\u2019s vision embodied in the work. An effort to\ncommunicate by these sorts of objective means is what turns the\nexternal material into a medium, that is, \u201can\nintermediary\u201d between the artist and audience (AE:\n201). But as the experience behind expression is \u201cintensely\nindividualized\u201d, the work can also open for the public \n\n\nnew fields of experience and disclose new aspects and qualities in\nfamiliar scenes and objects. (AE: 149) \n\n\nIn Dewey\u2019s view, communication in the arts, however, takes a\ndifferent form than in the sciences for example: \u201cscience states\nmeanings; art expresses them\u201d (AE: 90). Like many other\nphilosophers of art, Dewey emphasizes that artistic communication does\nnot take place on the level of statements and propositional knowing.\nAesthetic art, by contrast to science, constitutes an experience.\nArt\u2019s manner of communicating is \u201cevocative\u201d: by\nrendering objective and physical material into an expressive medium,\nthe artist seeks to evoke \u201cthe experience he or she wants the\naudience to have or reflect upon\u201d (Stroud 2011: 105). The\ncognitive and the experiential sides of art are thereby seen to be\nvery much intertwined in Dewey\u2019s aesthetics.\n2.6 Culture and Art\u2019s Significance\n\nDewey\u2019s take on culture also shows the moderate character of his\naesthetic naturalism. He does not consider culture an illusory or in\nsome other way irreal phenomenon, something that should be explained\naway by reducing it to natural reality. Dewey even finds it\nunfortunate how often the term \u201cnaturalism\u201d has been\nwrongly thought \u201cto signify a disregard of all values that\ncannot be reduced to the physical and animal\u201d (AE:\n156). In contrast, Dewey believes that humans are both natural and\ncultural creatures through and through and that the real challenge is\nto investigate how these two ineliminable sides of human life, nature\nand culture, are intertwined. Dewey, in fact, became so interested in\nthis issue that he even had plans of naming his late philosophy\n\u201ccultural naturalism\u201d (Alexander 2013).\n\nDewey explains culture as a form of \u201cemergence\u201d, that is,\nculture is something that in time emerges from nature. In other words,\n\n\n\nculture is the product not of efforts of men put forth in a void or\njust upon themselves, but of prolonged and cumulative interaction with\nenvironment. (AE: 34\u201335) \n\n\nNature and culture are two different layers of human life. The two key\nconcepts in this instance are rhythm and ritual. Rhythm is for Dewey a\nfundamental feature of the world, whose existence in nature predates\n\u201cpoetry, painting, architecture and music\u201d (AE:\n147). He, again, refers to such rhythmic processes in nature as\n\u201cdawn and sunset, day and night, rain and sunshine\u201d,\n\u201cthe circular course of the seasons\u201d, \u201cthe\never-recurring cycles of growth\u201d, and \u201cthe never-ceasing\nround of births and deaths\u201d, which he believes created a\nrhythmic space for human experience already from its very dawn. Dewey\nargues further that new layers emerged into human existence once\nhumans no longer merely observed the rhythmic changes of nature but\nstarted to participate in them in the form of rituals and other\ncommunal gatherings. Humans came to use the rhythms of nature to\ncelebrate their relationship with nature and to commemorate their most\nintense experiences. Dewey writes: \n\n\nExperiences of war, of hunt, of sowing and reaping, of the death and\nresurrection of vegetation, of stars circling over watchful shepherds,\nof constant return of the inconstant moon, were undergone to be\nreproduced in pantomime and generated the sense of life as drama.\n(AE: 153)\n\n\nWith these rituals Dewey believes humans\u2019 relationship to the\nsurrounding world rose to a level where they started to reflect on\ntheir place in the order of things more intently. And the rituals\nformed in response to the cycles of nature started to embody the\nworldviews and values of the human groups that they gathered together.\nThe rituals created a sense of community with one\u2019s immediate\nfellows, as well as a sense of continuity of past generations, thereby\nwidening and enriching \u201cthe designs of living\u201d\n(AE: 29). In Dewey\u2019s view, these rituals were\n\u201cesthetic\u201d, but they were \u201calso more than\nesthetic\u201d, for \n\n\neach of these communal modes of activity united the practical, the\nsocial, and the educative in an integrated whole having esthetic form.\n(AE: 330\u2013331) \n\n\nCulture is, then, for Dewey something \u201csituated\u201d as well\nas \u201csituating\u201d (Alexander 2013: 13).\n\nAn important value that Dewey sees in art is related to these communal\nsides of experience. Although Dewey believes each culture is held\ntogether by its own individuality, it is still possible to create\ncontinuity and community between cultures by expanding experience to\nabsorb the attitudes and values of other cultures. In the end, Dewey\nregards works of art as \n\n\nthe only media of complete and unhindered communication between man\nand man that can occur in a world full of gulfs and walls that limit\ncommunity of experience. (AE: 110) \n\n\nFor example, \n\n\nbarriers are dissolved, limiting prejudices melt away, when we enter\ninto the spirit of Negro and Polynesian art. (AE: 337) \n\n\nAs a result of such engagements we start to \u201clearn to\nhear\u201d with someone else\u2019s \u201cears\u201d and\n\u201csee\u201d with someone else\u2019s \u201ceyes\u201d. Works\nof art are, then, for Dewey \u201cthe most intimate and energetic\nmeans of aiding individuals to share in the arts of living\u201d\n(AE: 339).\n\nThere has been considerable discussion in aesthetics whether art has\nintrinsic value or whether its value is dependent on some external\ngoal it helps to fulfill. Dewey rejects the dichotomy, because he\nthinks talk of art\u2019s utilitarian aspects tends to involve a too\nnarrow conception of utility. The utility of an artwork is different\nin kind from the utility of an umbrella or a mower. While these and\nsimilar utilitarian objects serve \u201ca particular and limited\nend\u201d, an artwork \u201cserves life\u201d, for example by\ncarrying us to \u201ca refreshed attitude toward the circumstances\nand exigencies of ordinary experience\u201d (AE: 140, 144).\nArtworks can serve life through their evocative function; they can\nraise experiences that educate us. Dewey also emphasizes how the work\nof the artwork does not end at the close of the immediate experience,\nbut \u201ccontinues to operate in indirect channels\u201d\n(AE: 144).\n\nLike all important experiences, our engagements with artworks can also\nlead to what Philip Jackson calls \u201cexperiential growth\u201d\n(Jackson 1998: 111). Here Jackson follows Dewey\u2019s notion of\ngrowth, which is central to his philosophy of education. The idea of\ngrowth is also related to Dewey\u2019s naturalist underpinnings; when\nthe organism overcomes some problematic situation, there is at least\nsome minimal degree of growth. The organism learns something and can\nuse the experience in new circumstances in the future. Growth, in\nother words is, for Dewey, \n\n\nessentially the ability to learn from experience; the power to retain\nfrom one experience something which is of avail in coping with the\ndifficulties of a later situation. (DE: 49) \n\n\nThrough the different types of experiences artworks can evoke, art too\ncan be an important source of this sort of growth. This is why Dewey\nthinks we should feel a similar type of respect toward \u201cthe\ncreators\u201d of perceptive artworks as we do toward \u201cthe\ninventors of microscopes and microphones\u201d; in both cases we are\ndealing with artefacts, which can train us in new modes of perception\nand \u201copen new objects to be observed and enjoyed\u201d\n(EN: 293).\n3. Critical Reactions\n\nCriticism of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics dates from even before Art\nas Experience. Curt Ducasse (1929), for example, believed that\nDewey\u2019s instrumentalism generates a strange theory which holds\nthat human life is a matter of tool-making, all tools are essentially\ntools for tool-making, and only satisfactions arising from tool-making\nshould be acknowledged (see Alexander 1998). He also criticized Dewey\nfor not allowing for meaningless satisfactions and anarchistic\npleasures. Aesthetic perception of colors and tones as such does not\nneed any presence of meaning; nor does appreciation of rainbows or\nsunsets. Meaning also need not be present in things of pure design. He\nagreed with Schopenhauer, contra Dewey, that aesthetic contemplation\nrequires not attending to meanings. Also, because the creation of art\nmay on occasion occur in one stroke, it too can be without meaning.\nFurther, it is only by accident that the feeling expressed in the\ncreation of art is due to the perceived situation. Emotions are not\nalways responses to concrete situations and many emotions are about\nnothing. Artistic expression of emotion should be distinguished from\nutilitarian expression. It is only the latter that deals with the\nobject of emotion.\n\nAnother early critic, Edna Shearer (1935a), thought that Dewey buried\nart under extraneous ethical and political considerations. She\nrejected the idea that all life ought to be like art in combining the\nconsummatory and the instrumental. Dewey\u2019s desire to overcome\nthe means/ends distinction is also problematic since a work of art\ndoes not seriously contain as ingredients the process that led to its\nproduction. The perfect amalgamation of means and ends is utopian.\nFurther, toil just cannot be eliminated from society or from the\ncreative process.\n\nArt as Experience early on had the misfortune of receiving\ntwo reviews that negatively impacted its reception. The first, by an\navowed follower, Stephen Pepper, complained that it was not truly\npragmatist and that Dewey had reverted to an earlier Hegelianism\n(Pepper 1939). The second, by Benedetto Croce, seemed to confirm this\n(Croce 1948). Croce, widely seen as Hegelian himself, saw so many\nsimilarities between Dewey\u2019s work and his own that he accused\nDewey of lifting his ideas. Dewey (1948) insisted otherwise, but the\nsense that there was something too Hegelian in Art as\nExperience remained. This did not stop many philosophers,\neducators, and other intellectuals from producing works in aesthetic\ntheory that were strongly influenced by Dewey. Even before Art as\nExperience Dewey\u2019s writings on aesthetics and art\ninfluenced, and were influenced by, such writers as Mary Mullen\n(1923), who taught seminars on aesthetics and was Associate Director\nof Education for the Barnes Foundation; Lawrence Buermeyer (1924), who\nwas another Associate Director of Education at the Barnes Foundation;\nAlbert Barnes himself (1928); and Thomas Munro (1928). After the\nbook\u2019s publication his followers included Irwin Edman (1939),\nStephen Pepper (1939, 1945, 1953), Horace Kallen (1942), Thomas Munro\nagain (numerous books) and Van Meter Ames (1947, 1953). Art historian\nMeyer Schapiro was one of his students.\n\nAfter the publication of Art as Experience there emerged a\nlong chain of both criticism and defense. Eliseo Vivas (1937) argued\nthat Dewey holds two theories about the emotions\u2019 role in\naesthetic experience, one that the esthetic object arouses emotion in\nthe spectator, and the other that the content of meaning of art,\nobjectively speaking, is emotion. But, he argued, experimental\naesthetics has shown that emotion is an accidental consequence of\naesthetic apprehension, and so should not be included in its\ndefinition. The same aesthetic object can arouse different emotional\nreactions in different spectators. Some trained persons in music even\ndeny that adequate aesthetic experience involves emotion. Dewey also\nhas not given an explanation of the means by which the object\nexpresses emotion. Vivas himself defined aesthetic experience in terms\nof rapt attention involving apprehension of the object\u2019s\nimmanent meanings.\n\nIn a second article (Vivas 1938), he asked: Are emotions attached to\nthe material? How is this consistent with the idea that emotion is not\nexpressed in the object? And how are these ideas consistent with the\nidea that emotion is aroused in the spectator? Vivas insisted that not\nall art arouses emotion in everyone who has effective intercourse with\nit. Music, for sophisticated listeners, is often not suggestive of\nemotions. When we find \u201csadness\u201d in music we would do\nbetter to call it an objective character of the music than an emotion.\nAnother problem for Dewey: if the self disappears in experience then\nhow can the object arouse emotion in the self or have emotion attached\nto it? Also, if the self disappears into harmony, how can there be the\nkind of disharmony associated with emotion?\n\nWe have already mentioned Pepper\u2019s objection that Dewey\u2019s\ntheory is not sufficiently pragmatic (Pepper 1939). His specific\nobjection was that Dewey\u2019s views were eclectic, incorporating\nelements both of pragmatism and of Hegelian organicism. Pepper\nbelieved that both theories, as well as formalism, can be valuable\nwhen taken separately, but that the mixture in Dewey hurts pragmatism.\nPepper identified organicism with the view that the ultimate reality\nis The Absolute. Dewey replied (1939) that he had based his aesthetic\ntheory on examination of the subject-matter and not on any a\npriori theory. Words he used, such as \u201ccoherence\u201d,\n\u201cwhole\u201d, \u201cintegration\u201d, and\n\u201ccomplete\u201d, were intended to have meaning consistent with\nhis pragmatic empiricism and did not by themselves indicate a\ncommitment to idealism. Moreover, it was one of his main points that\nalthough these terms were applicable to aesthetic matters\nthey could not, contra the idealists, be extended to the world as a\nwhole. The terms had a special sense applying only to experiences as\naesthetic. Dewey rejected any theory of a great cosmic harmony\nassociated with the Hegelian notion of the Absolute.\n\nIn a later work, Pepper (1945) agreed with Dewey that each reading of\na poem brings a new experience, but thought that, since there is also\nidentity of context that can make the differences minor, we can speak\nof an identical quality running through the different situations.\nPepper had many positive things to say about Dewey\u2019s\n\u201ccontextualism\u201d (his word for pragmatism in aesthetics),\nbut he insisted that there is much more permanence of aesthetic values\nin the world than Dewey would admit. A great work of art may be\nappreciated as long as the physical work exists and someone exists to\nperceive it, and insofar as it appeals to common instincts, it may\nappeal to people of varied cultures.\n\nIsabel Creed (1945) complained that Dewey leaves no place for works\nthat celebrate equilibrium achieved, or for works that result from the\nartist playing around with the medium. Nor does Dewey explain\naccidentally encountered aesthetic experiences of natural objects. She\nthought, contra Dewey, that struggle with our environment is not\nnecessary for aesthetic experience.\n\nCroce, mentioned earlier, rightly pointed out many similarities\nbetween his own and Dewey\u2019s thought (Croce 1948). There were,\nhowever, still three points of serious contention: (1) Croce placed\nsignificantly more importance on the universality of art than Dewey,\n(2) he still insisted that the material of art consists not of\nexternal things but of internal sentiments of human passions: a\ncharacteristically idealist position that Dewey vehemently rejected,\nand (3) whereas he believed that art gives knowledge of a higher\nreality, Dewey did not. Croce asserted that Dewey is still arguing\nagainst Hegelians of his youth who held, for example, to a notion of\n\u201cthe Absolute\u201d, which Croce had rejected. Dewey (1948), in\nresponding to Croce, argued that the list of shared beliefs Croce\nmentioned in his review were just ideas widely familiar to\naestheticians. He thought that because of Croce\u2019s idealism there\ncan be no common ground of discussion between them. In return, Croce\n(1952) argued that Dewey is too wedded to empiricism and pragmatism\nand that it is only because Dewey, contrary to his own claims, is\ncommitted to a kind of dualism, that he cannot understand\nCroce\u2019s identification of intuition and expression or recognize\nhow similar Croce\u2019s view is to his own. Frederic Simoni (1952)\nargued that neither Croce nor Dewey was Hegelian in the sense of\nbelieving in the Absolute. George Douglas (1970) agreed with Simoni,\nfinding many similarities between Dewey and Croce. However, Douglas\ndid agree with Pepper (1939) that Dewey never reconciled the\npragmatist and historicist (Hegelian) dimensions of his thought (cf.\nVittorio 2012, Copenhaver 2017).\n\nPatrick Romanell (1949) held that Croce and Dewey at least share the\nview that art is about aesthetic experience. However, Dewey\u2019s\ndefinition of the subject matter of philosophy of art as aesthetic\nexperience (which treats it as a special type of experience) is\ninconsistent with his definition of it as the aesthetic phase of\nexperience. Also, when Dewey speaks of aesthetic experience he is not\nfunctionalist and is not consistent with his pragmatism. Dewey should\nhave held that just as there is no such thing as religious experience,\nthere is no such thing as aesthetic experience. Dewey (1950) replied\nthat every normally complete experience is aesthetic in its\nconsummatory phase, that the arts and their experience are\ndevelopments of this primary phase, and that there is nothing\ninconsistent in this. Where Romanell saw incompatibility Dewey saw\ncontinuity of development. Van Meter Ames (1953), however, defended\nDewey against critics up to this point in time.\n\nGeorge Boas (1953) argued that Dewey yearns for universality in art\nwhere none can be found. He believed that Dewey wrongly takes the term\n\u201cart\u201d to have only one meaning where it has many.\nMoreover, while some art communicates, other art conceals: it is wrong\nto say that all art, or even that all great art, communicates\nuniversally. Also, not everyone who practices art is interested in\ncommunion and democracy. Some art is intended for communion with God,\nnot with humanity; some art is intended for communion with no one but\nthe artist him or herself.\n\nOne of the leading aestheticians of the time, Susanne Langer (1953)\nsaw pragmatism in general, and Dewey in particular, as guilty of\npsychologism and therefore unable to deal with the issues that really\nchallenge aestheticians. Pragmatism\u2019s assumption is that all\nhuman interests are manifestations of drives motivated by animal\nneeds, thus reducing human to animal psychology. Aesthetic values are\nthereby interpreted either as direct satisfactions or as instrumental\nto fulfilling psychological needs, making artistic experience no\ndifferent from ordinary experience. This misses the essence of art,\nwhat makes it as important as science or religion. Whereas Dewey held\nthat there is no essential difference between art experience and\nordinary experience Langer thought that the appreciative attitude\ntoward art is not at all like that toward a new car or a beautiful\nmorning. But Felicia Kruse (2007) argued that Langer misinterpreted\nDewey on several points and was actually much closer to Dewey than she\nthought.\n\nIn the 1950s there was an analytic revolution in English-speaking\naesthetics. Prior aesthetic theories were considered to be too\nspeculative and unclear. Dewey\u2019s work was caught up in this\ncondemnation. Arnold Isenberg, for instance, in a founding document of\nanalytic aesthetics, originally published in 1950, dismissed Art\nas Experience as a \u201chodgepodge of conflicting methods and\nundisciplined speculations\u201d, (1950 [1987: 128]) although he\nfound it full of profound suggestions. Dewey\u2019s theories of\nexpression and creativity were particular targets of analytic attack.\nHis was among the views singled out in a general critique of\nexpression as a defining characteristic of art, although often his own\ndistinctive theory was ignored in the process. A situation followed,\nand continued well into the 1980s, in which, according to one editor\nof The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Dewey\u2019s\naesthetics was virtually ignored (Fisher 1989). While Monroe\nBeardsley, one of the most important late twentieth century\naestheticians, kept an interest in Dewey alive (1958, 1975, 1982),\nparticularly in his discussions of aesthetic experience, other major\nfigures, including Arthur Danto, Mary Mothersill and Richard Wollheim,\ncompletely ignored him. Nelson Goodman may be a partial exception\n(Freeland 2001). He certainly shared with Dewey a conviction that art\nand science are close in many ways. And, like Dewey, he replaced the\nquestion \u201cwhat is art?\u201d with \u201cwhen is art?\u201d\nThey also both took a naturalist approach to the arts. However,\nGoodman, who never refers to Dewey in his Languages of Art\n(1976), saw art in terms of languages and other symbol systems,\nwhereas Dewey saw it in terms of experience.\n\nEdward Ballard (1957), in a move characteristic of the rise of\nanalytic philosophy in aesthetics, asserted that Dewey rejects many\ndistinctions that are necessary for philosophy, and that this leads to\na kind of irrationalism which results in his depending on problematic\nmetaphors like \u201cfunding\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d. He\nthought Dewey\u2019s avoidance of specific techniques in forming\ntheories, for example the technique of formal definition, to be\nanti-intellectual. Dewey\u2019s rejection of universals as illusions\nand his enthusiastic acceptance of nominalism must ultimately fail,\nfor theory requires logically inter-related propositions that refer to\nconcepts.\n\nCharles Gauss (1960), like Pepper before him, protested that\nDewey\u2019s organicism in Art as Experience disconnects\nfrom his earlier pragmatism. Pragmatism, unlike organicism, focuses on\ninteraction with a background that is partially inorganic. Also,\ncontra Dewey, he maintained that aesthetic enjoyment is not a\nparticular kind of enjoyment, but enjoyment of aesthetic\ncharacteristics.\n\nMarshall Cohen (1977, originally 1965) complained, also in the\nanalytic vein, about the vagueness of Dewey\u2019s terms. He\nespecially wondered whether unity can really distinguish\naesthetic from non-aesthetic experience. He reasoned that the\nexperience of being badly beaten can have as much unity as hearing a\nsonata. Moreover, aesthetic experience can often have the\ndiscontinuous character that Dewey ascribes only to practical\nexperience.\n\nContemporary American aesthetician Arnold Berleant began his career\n(1970) in a way that was much more sympathetic to Dewey. He has, in\nhis many writings, developed themes similar to Dewey\u2019s, for\nexample, in his concepts of the \u201caesthetic field\u201d and\n\u201cengagement\u201d (1970; 1991). His work on the aesthetics of\nthe environment had a strong influence on the recently emergent field\nof everyday aesthetics which we will discuss below.\n\nBy contrast, Roger Scruton (1974) objected mainly to Dewey\u2019s\nnaturalism. He interpreted Dewey as insisting that aesthetic need must\nunderlie all our interest in art, and believed that Dewey fails to\ncapture what we mean when we say that we are interested in a picture\n\u201cfor its own sake\u201d. Needs can be satisfied by many objects\nbut one cannot substitute pictures for one another. Unlike animal\nneed, interest in a picture involves thought of its object. As a\npolitical conservative, Scruton has been opposed to Dewey\u2019s\nviews on education. However, his work on architecture (Scruton 1979),\nwith its emphasis on context, unity, functionalism, and the relations\nbetween architecture and everyday aesthetics, is remarkably similar to\nDewey\u2019s views about art in general, although Dewey\u2019s name\nis never mentioned.\n\nJohn McDermott (1976), one of the leaders of the American Philosophy\ntradition in the later part of the twentieth century, followed Dewey\nin arguing that all experience is potentially aesthetic, where the\naesthetic sensibility refers to how we feel about our situation. Art\ntoday leads us to life. In order to achieve consummatory experience we\nneed to cooperate with our environment.\n\nAlthough Monroe Beardsley (1982) often spoke positively of\nDewey\u2019s notion of aesthetic experience, he thought that Dewey\nwas obsessed with the dangers of dualism and that he talked about\n\u201cseparation\u201d in a misleading way. Dewey thinks the\npractices of hanging paintings in special buildings would deny\ncontinuity between art and life. Yet Beardsley sees no real problem\nhere, for people who see a painting in a museum bring their culture\nwith them. Also, against Dewey\u2019s stress on continuity, Beardsley\nthought that discontinuity in nature and in culture is\nrequired for the emergence of genuine novelty in art. As opposed to\nDewey, Beardsley stressed the ways in which art is independent,\nrelatively self-sufficient, and autonomous to a degree. Alan Goldman\n(2005) argued that Beardsley borrows too much from Dewey\u2019s\nobscure discussion of experience, but articulates better than Dewey\nthe idea that aesthetic experience is a matter of complete engagement\nof our faculties with both instrumental and intrinsic benefits. More\nrecently, Goldman (2013) has developed what he calls \u201cthe broad\nview of aesthetic experience\u201d, whose similarities to\nDewey\u2019s view he readily acknowledges.\n\nJoseph Margolis (1980) is perhaps the most important contemporary\naesthetician coming out of the analytic school to take Dewey\nseriously, having a natural affinity to pragmatist ways of thought.\nHis idea that works of art are culturally emergent but physically\nembodied entities is Deweyan in spirit, as is his insistence on a\nrobust relativist theory of interpretation. However, Margolis seldom\nrefers to Dewey and, although he believes himself closer to\nDewey\u2019s \u201cHegelianism\u201d than to Peirce\u2019s\n\u201cKantianism\u201d, he finds Peirce more interesting. He also\nfaults Dewey for not being an historicist (1999).\n\nThe relative lack of interest in Dewey changed for several reasons in\nthe late 1970s. First, Richard Rorty turned analytic philosophy on its\nhead by advocating a return to pragmatism (Rorty 1979, 1982). In this,\nDewey was one of his avowed heroes. Unfortunately, Rorty was not a\nclose reader of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics.\n\nDewey\u2019s aesthetics finally received an excellent exposition in\nthe work of Thomas Alexander (1987). Alexander developed his ideas\nfurther in a book on eco-ontology and the aesthetics of existence\n(2013). Mark Johnson, in a project inspired by cognitive science, drew\non Dewey\u2019s anti-dualism to develop a theory of the aesthetics of\nhuman understanding (2007, 2018). Meanwhile, there has been a steady\ninterest in Dewey\u2019s aesthetics in the philosophy of education,\nwith articles appearing on a regular basis in such publications as the\nJournal of Aesthetic Education and Studies in the\nPhilosophy of Education and several books (Jackson 1998, Garrison\n1997, Greene 2001, Maslak 2006, Granger 2006). Ueno (2015) continued\nin this tradition, stressing the importance of aesthetics in\nDewey\u2019s theory of democracy and education during a period of\nurbanization and industrialization.\n\nDewey\u2019s renewed influence was due in part to increased interest\nin various continental aestheticians. The similarities between Dewey\nand Maurice Merleau-Ponty are the most striking (Ames 1953, Kestenbaum\n1977), but he also shares certain features with Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(Gilmour 1987, who also notes important differences, and Jeannot\n2001). Given his critique of capitalism, one can also find connections\nbetween his thinking and that of Marxist aestheticians, particularly\nTheodor Adorno (Lysaker 1998), although there are important\ndifferences, especially where Adorno advocates the autonomy of art\nwhile Dewey stresses continuity (Lewis 2005, Eldridge 2010).\n\nThere has also been some work on marked similarities between\nDewey\u2019s aesthetic thought and that of Taoism (Grange 2001),\nTranscendental Meditation (Zigler 1982), Dogen\u2019s version of Zen\n(Earls 1992), the great Indian aesthetician Abhinavagupta (Mathur\n1981), the Bhagavad-Gita (Stroud 2009), and Confucius (Shusterman\n2009, Man 2007, Mullis 2005, Grange 2004). Alexander has recently\ndiscussed relations between Dewey and Eastern aesthetics generally\n(Alexander 2009).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, many attacks on Dewey focused on his views on\nexpression. Tormey (1986) for example chided Dewey for assuming that\nan artist is always expressing something and that the expressive\nqualities in the work are the result of that act. He thought that\nDewey wrongly abandons the distinction between voluntary and\ninvoluntary expression, and in doing so, undermines paradigmatic\nexamples of expressive behavior. A work of art may possess expressive\nqualities of sadness but this is not necessarily the intended\nconsequence of the productive activity of the artist. For Alan Tormey,\nthe artist is not expressing him or herself: he/she is simply making\nan expressive object. Michael Mitias (1992) defended Dewey against\nthese criticisms.\n\nDavid Novitz (1992), who approved of Dewey\u2019s ideas that art\nderives from experiences of everyday life and that the artistic\nprocess infuses our daily lives, questioned the idea that fine art\nalways embodies consummatory or unified experiences. He thought Dewey\nhas an idealized view of art that borrows from the very aestheticist\ntheories he criticizes. Further, Dewey does not sufficiently question\nthe boundaries of art.\n\nRichard Shusterman (1992, etc., see bibliography) is the most widely\nknown advocate of Dewey\u2019s pragmatist aesthetics. He especially\nemphasized the possibilities of treating popular art as fine art with\nhis well-known example of rap as fine art. He also extended aesthetics\ninto the realm of everyday life with his concept of\n\u201csomaesthetics\u201d (2012). Shusterman strikingly contrasted\nDewey\u2019s approach to that of analytic aesthetics. Like Dewey, he\nstressed the idea that art and aesthetics are both culturally and\nphilosophically central. Some of his most trenchant comments involved\nsimilarities between Dewey\u2019s thought and that of such\ncontinental thinkers as Foucault and Adorno. However he also had his\ncriticisms of Dewey. He took Dewey to be redefining art in terms of\naesthetic experience, which he believed to be too slippery a concept\nto explain much. Moreover, he asserted that although Dewey has much to\nsay about aesthetic experience, Dewey also holds that it is\nindefinable, and this leads to problems with its being a criterion of\nvalue in art. On the other hand, Shusterman thought that Dewey sees\ndefining art in terms of experience as a matter of getting us to have\nmore and better experiences with art, and not of giving a definition\nin terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. So, although he\ndoubted that philosophical theory can redefine art, he suspected Dewey\nis not trying to do this anyway. Moreover, he thought it not only\npossible but valuable to make less dramatic classificatory changes, as\nfor example in legitimating rock music as fine art. He believed that\nwhereas Dewey sought a global redefinition of art, he was simply\ntrying to remedy certain limitations in art practice. Later, he said\nthat much art fails to generate Dewey\u2019s aesthetic experience\n(Shusterman 2000). He also observed that art cannot be redefined to be\nequivalent to aesthetic experience, as we are hardly going to\nreclassify an incredible experience of a sunset as art. Shusterman\nalso insisted on the value of aesthetic experiences that are\nfragmented and ruptured, contrary to Dewey\u2019s emphasis on unity,\nand noted that Dewey neglected the possibility of lingering reflection\nafter moments of consummation (Shusterman 2004). Paul C. Taylor\naddressed Shusterman\u2019s criticism of Dewey as trying to find a\ndefinition of art arguing that Dewey provides \n\n\na very different kind of definition, one offered in full view of its\nsociohistorical contingency and pragmatic fuzziness. (Taylor 2002: 24)\n\n\n\nThis strand of pro-Deweyan thinking was also pursued by Crispin\nSartwell in response to multi-culturalism and everyday aesthetics\n(Sartwell 1995, 2003). In the later instance Sartwell connected\neveryday aesthetics to Dewey in the ideas that art arises from non-art\nactivities and that the domain of aesthetics goes well beyond the fine\narts.\n\nSome contemporary feminist aestheticians have noted that Dewey shares\nmany of their concerns, for example their rejection of mind/body\ndualism, their democratic instincts, their contextualism, and their\ntendency to break down traditional distinctions (Seigfried 1996, Duran\n2001). Charlene Seigfried found several aspects in Dewey\u2019s\nthought that may enrich feminist exploration of women\u2019s\nexperiences, including his antidualism, his perspectivalism, his\nworking from concrete experience, his emphasis on the role of feeling\nin experience, his stress on doing and making, and his attack on the\ndivision between practice and theory. However, she noted that Dewey\nneglected sexism in his analysis, and sometimes made sexist\nassumptions.\n\nNo\u00ebl Carroll (2001) thought that Dewey\u2019s theory of art\nfails to cover many contemporary works which then act as\ncounterexamples to his definition of art as experience. For example,\nas Rothko\u2019s paintings can overwhelm us at one shot, their\nexperience may not have Dewey\u2019s requisite development and\nclosure. Carroll also thought that the view that experiences of art\nmust be unified is too narrow. Cage\u2019s\n4\u203233\u2033, which Carroll takes to obviously be a work\nof art, does not consummate or have qualitative unity. Finally, he\nthought that if experiences of everyday dispersion can be aesthetic\nthen Dewey\u2019s distinction between \u201can experience\u201d and\ndisconnected daily experience dissolves. This might be contrasted to\nPhilip Jackson\u2019s (1998) defense of Dewey against similar\ncriticisms, especially with respect to Cage\u2019s\n4\u203233\u2033 which he saw as fitting Dewey\u2019s\ndefinition nicely. For Jackson, it is the experience that\nrequires unity, not the physical product.\n\nGeorge Dickie (2001) said that Dewey sets forth an expression theory\nof art without any supporting argument. Lumping Dewey with\nCollingwood, he thought such theorists place art in the same domain\nwith the growl of a dog with a bone. They made the creation of art\nlike the bowerbird\u2019s production of bowers, i.e., a result of\ninnate natures without a plan in mind. For Dickie, expression of\nemotion is neither sufficient nor necessary for defining art. He\nthought these theories wrongly hold that psychological mechanisms in\nhuman nature are sufficient for the production of art, as if the\nproduction of artworks is teleologically determined by such.\n\nIn her popular introductory textbook, Cynthia Freeland (2001) observed\nthat Dewey held that art is the best window to another culture, that\nit is a universal language, and that we should try to experience\nanother culture as from within since barriers and prejudices can melt\naway when we enter into the spirit of another culture\u2019s art.\nAlthough this universalism seems similar to Clive Bell\u2019s\nformalism, Freeland noted that for Dewey art is defined not as form\nbut as expression of the life of a community. She thought, however,\nthat we must also know many external facts about the community, and\nthat we must recognize that no culture is homogeneous: there may not\nbe one viewpoint in a culture. She also gave a positive nod\nto Dewey\u2019s call for a revolution in which the values leading to\nintelligent enjoyment of art are incorporated into our social\nrelations. Finally, she classified Dewey\u2019s aesthetics as a\ncognitive theory since it focuses on art\u2019s role in helping\npeople to perceive and manipulate reality. Thus she found continuity\nbetween Dewey\u2019s and Goodman\u2019s approaches to art as a kind\nof language.\n\nDewey\u2019s thought in aesthetics has also sometimes been brought to\nbear in analysis of other aspects of his philosophy. Noteworthy is the\nethical work of Gregory Pappas (2008), especially his chapter titled\n\u201cThe Intelligent, Aesthetic, and Democratic Way of Life\u201d.\nHere he discusses Dewey\u2019s aesthetic notion of balance as it\napplies to ethics. Mark Johnson (1994) and Steven Fesmire (2003) also\nintroduce Dewey\u2019s aesthetic theories into discussion of ethics.\nScott Stroud (2011), previously mentioned, further develops the\nDeweyan idea of moral self-cultivation, while Nathan Crick (2010)\napplies Dewey\u2019s aesthetic ideas to a conception of rhetoric as\nan art which in a democracy promotes freedom.\n\nRecently there have been lively debates over the Deweyan tradition in\nthe aesthetics of everyday life. Most of the contestants are inspired\nby Dewey\u2019s valuation of everyday aesthetic experience but depart\nfrom him in various ways. Sherri Irvin (2008a) has argued that the\nfragmented character of everyday aesthetic experiences might, contra\nDewey\u2019s emphasis on consummation, be what gives them their\ndistinctive quality. She goes so far as to assert that even scratching\nan itch can be aesthetically appreciated (Irvin 2008b). Glenn Parsons\nand Allen Carlson (2008) contend that, although Dewey\u2019s\naesthetic theory may seem particularly appropriate to appreciating\neveryday objects since we interact with them in a more intimate and\nmulti-sensory way than with art objects, this approach, shared by\nKorsmeyer (1999), Brady (2005), Leddy (2005, 2012), Shusterman (2006,\n2012), and Saito (2007), fails to honor traditional distinctions\nbetween aesthetic and mere \u201cbodily\u201d pleasures. They might\nhave also mentioned Glenn Kuehn (2005) who takes an explicitly Deweyan\napproach to the aesthetics of food, and Katya Mandoki (2007) who takes\nDewey as one source of her everyday aesthetics. They think it wrong\nthat the pleasures of taking a bath, for example, could be considered\naesthetic. Rather, the objects of everyday aesthetics should be\nappreciated mainly for their functional beauty (pleasures of the\nproximal senses are not aesthetic, although they may still add some\nvalue to the overall experience), and knowledge of the function of\neveryday objects is required for their appropriate appreciation. Brian\nSoucek (2009) and Christopher Dowling (2010) raise criticisms against\neveryday aesthetics along similar lines. However, Kalle Puolakka\n(2014, 2015, 2017, 2018) defends a Deweyan approach to everyday\naesthetics drawing on Dewey\u2019s theory of imagination and on\nrecent work on Dewey and moral imagination.\n\nDewey continues to have influence with respect to particular art\nforms. For example David Clowney and Robert Rawlins (2014) use Dewey\nto argue that risk-taking and showmanship are integral to music as\nperformed, and Aili Bresnahan (2014) develops a Deweyan theory of\nperforming arts practice with a special view to dance.\n\nA significant recent development in philosophical aesthetics has been\nthe placing of more attention on biology. Along these lines, Alva\nNo\u00eb (2015) has taken a markedly Deweyan stance in discussion of\nart as strange tools. He writes that although we can take seeing as\nsomething that happens in the head, it is, in \u201cDewey\u2019s\nimage, a transaction of doing and undergoing\u201d (No\u00eb 2015:\n78). He agrees with Dewey that lives are not made up of a series of\nsensations, but are \n\n\ncomposed of experiences that demand to be named\u2014that dinner\nin Venice\u2026 [etc.]. (2015: 113) \n\n\nMost notably, he takes a quote from Dewey about how the existence of\nworks of art has become an obstruction to a theory about them as an\nepigraph to his book. He ends his book by noting that in Dewey\u2019s\nview we are all artists since we are all engaged in making\nexperiences. And yet, \n\n\ntrue artists don\u2019t only make experiences. They make\nobjects\u2026 that afford the opportunity for integral experience.\n(2015: 205)\n\n\nIt is a mark of the endurance and power of Dewey\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory that it has been so frequently criticized and defended from so\nmany different angles. Although many of these criticisms rest on an\nincomplete or distorted understanding of Dewey\u2019s thought, there\nare also many that should be answered by anyone who seeks to carry on\nDewey\u2019s legacy.\n4. Wider Cultural Relevance\n\nDewey was ahead of his time in his devotion to multiculturalism. The\nselection of illustrations Dewey chose for Art as Experience\nincluded Pueblo Indian pottery, Bushmen rock-painting, Scythian\nornament, and African sculpture, as well as works by El Greco, Renoir,\nCezanne and Matisse. He was interested in traditional and folk arts in\nMexico, admiring the designs of the rural schools over those of the\ncities (1926). He was also associated, mainly through Barnes, with\nAfrican-American culture. Barnes was invited to write a chapter for\nThe New Negro edited by Alain Locke (Locke 1925). The New\nNegro was one of the founding documents of the Harlem\nRenaissance. The students in Dewey\u2019s and Barnes\u2019 first\nexperimental classes in art education were mainly from the black\nworking class. Barnes collected African-American art and also\nencouraged African-American students to study at the Barnes\nFoundation. African-American painter and illustrator Aaron Douglas,\nwho came to the foundation in 1927, studied in Paris in 1931 under a\nFoundation fellowship (Jubilee 1982). Barnes also had a long\nassociation with Lincoln University, a historically black college,\nmany students of which studied at the Barnes Foundation (Hollingsworth\n1994). Dewey was one of the founding members of the NAACP (National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People) and one of the\nsixty signatories to the 1909 \u201cCall\u201d for a National\nConference to Address Racial Inequality, a founding document for the\nNAACP (Library of Congress\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nDewey also sought to promote cross-cultural understanding through his\nfounding of the China Institute in New York City in 1926. The China\nInstitute, which continues today, advertises itself as the only\ninstitution in that city to focus solely on Chinese civilization, art\nand culture. Hu Shih, a student of Dewey\u2019s at Columbia and one\nof the leading figures in the creation of the Institute, invited him\nto Peking in 1919 (Yong Ho 2004\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nAlthough Dewey was widely versed in literature, architecture,\npainting, sculpture, and the theater, he was relatively uneducated in\nmusic, and he was said to be tone-deaf. Yet he often had insightful\nthings to say about music, and many musicians and music educators have\ndrawn inspiration from his theory (e.g., Zeltner 1975). Unfortunately,\nhe did not discuss photography or film as separate art forms.\n\nMany writers complain that Dewey showed little interest in the\navant-garde art of his time (for example, Eldridge 2010). It is true\nthat Cubism, Dadaism and Surrealism play no role in his writing, and\nhis theory seems to actually preclude Non-objective painting (Jacobson\n1960), although he does speak positively of abstract art. Nor did he\nrefer much to such innovative poets as T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound.\nAlthough this may indicate a conservative approach to the arts, he\nnonetheless had considerable influence on various innovative art\nmovements both in his own time and later. Perhaps most significantly,\nthe director of the Federal Art Project from 1935\u20131943, Holger\nCahill, was a Dewey follower (Mavigliano 1984). Amongst painters,\nThomas Hart Benton, the regionalist realist, was an early convert to\nhis philosophy. Dewey was also on the board of the influential Black\nMountain College, which had students such as Merce Cunningham and John\nCage. Josef Albers, an important painting teacher there, was first\ninfluenced by Dewey\u2019s educational theory and later by his\naesthetics (Gosse 2012).\n\nIn Mexico, Escuelas de Pintura al Aire Libre, or open-air painting\nschools, began during the Mexican Revolution and achieved an\nestablished structure under the government of Alvaro Obregon\n(1920\u201324). They were promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinez, who was\ninspired by Dewey.\n\n\nTurning to late twentieth century artists, Dewey\u2019s influence on\nAbstract Expressionism was especially strong (Buettner 1975, Berube\n1998). For example, Robert Motherwell, who studied Art as\nExperience when he was a philosophy major at Stanford, considered\nit to be one of his bibles (Berube 1998). Donald Judd, the Minimalist\nsculptor, read and admired Dewey (Raskin 2010). Earth Art, with its\nemphasis on getting art out of the museum, might even be seen as\napplied Dewey. There is also reason to believe that Allan Kaprow, one\nof the originators of Happenings and Performance Art, read Dewey and\ndrew on his ideas (Kelley 2003). Although one author has argued that\ncontemporary Body Art has moved away from the integrated consummated\naesthetic experience Dewey commends (Jay 2002), another argues that\nDewey anticipates this movement (Brodsky 2002).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<p>\nMost of John Dewey\u2019s works are collected to the thirty-seven\nvolume critical edition <em>The Collected Works of John Dewey,\n1882\u20131953</em>, edited by Jo Ann Boydston (Southern Illinois\nUniversity Press, 1969\u20131991).
