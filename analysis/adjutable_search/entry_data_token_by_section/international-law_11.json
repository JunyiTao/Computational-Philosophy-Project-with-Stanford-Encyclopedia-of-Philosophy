    "main_text": "Legitimacy || The Service Conception\n4.3 The Service Conception\n\nDifficulties with consent-based, or voluntarist, theories have led to\nthe exploration of alternative bases for the legitimacy of\ninternational law, especially in relation to those obligations not\ntraceable to a treaty. The two following approaches are not only\nnon-voluntarist, but they also make reference to objective standards\nof reason. One approach is inspired by Joseph Raz\u2019s influential\n\u201cservice conception of authority\u201d, which advances a Normal\nJustification Condition (NJC) on legitimate authority. According to\nthe NJC:\n\n\nA has legitimate authority over B if the latter would better conform\nwith reasons that apply to him if he intends to be guided by A\u2019s\ndirectives than if he does not. (Raz 2006: 1014; Tasioulas 2010, 2013)\n\n\nThe NJC purports to specify a generally applicable sufficient\ncondition of legitimate authority. An important feature of it is that\nit does not present the legitimacy of international law in an\nall-or-nothing manner, and this is so in two ways (Tasioulas\n2010). First, it may be that some areas of international law (e.g.,\nthe law on the use of force) enjoy legitimacy, whereas others (e.g.,\ninternational trade law) do not.  Second, it may be that some states\nare bound by a given area of international law, such as human rights\nlaw, whereas others are not.  This is because the former, but not the\nlatter, would better comply with reasons that apply to them by being\nbound by that international legal regime, whereas others would\nnot. This second possibility enables the Razian theory to accommodate\nthe possibility of a justified exceptionalism in relation to the\nlegitimate authority of international law. This is one potential\ntemplate for defending familiar claims that the United States, for\nexample, is not bound by norms on the use of force that properly bind\nother states because it should be free to use its immense capabilities\nto further the cause of justice around the globe in ways that other\nstates cannot. But a similar argument for exceptionalism might be\npressed in the case of weaker or poorer states in relation to\ninternational obligations\u2014for example, pertaining to free trade\nor environmental protection\u2014that are unduly burdensome for\nthem.\n\nLeaving aside the possibility of exceptionalism, the Razian theory\nfaces the challenge of how to integrate a proper respect for state\nsovereignty. To what extent, for example, does a due regard for\nsovereignty entail that there are certain matters that fall within the\njurisdiction of states and regarding which international law cannot\ninvalidate or override their decisions? The question is broadly\nanalogous to that which arises in the domestic context: to what extent\nis the authority of the state limited by a due respect for the\nautonomy of its citizens, such that the state should not seek to\nimpose obligations with respect to certain matters, e.g., selection of\noccupation or spouse, even if its directives would lead to greater\ncompliance by citizens with reasons applicable to them? Of course, the\nstate is an institution, one lacking the basic moral status of\nindividual human beings, but the question arises because of the value\nof collective identity and self-determination that is protected by\nsovereignty. In this connection, Raz has controversially proposed a\nmutually exclusive relationship between state sovereignty and a sound\ninternational human rights law (Raz 2010). Over and above state\nsovereignty as a constraint on the legitimacy of international law,\nthere is a more general question of how such authority is constrained\nby a proper principle of subsidiarity that favours the resolution of\npolitical questions at the most local level possible (F\u00f8llesdal\n1998; Finnis 2016). Finally, a special challenge arises regarding\ninternational law\u2019s claim to legitimate authority in the absence\nof its creation through democratic means, especially in relation to\nstates that are themselves democracies (see section 4.5).\n\nQuestions arise, however, about the extent to which any domain of\ninternational law can achieve legitimacy in these terms, especially\ngiven the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms at the global\nlevel. This is because, on the NJC, one way in which legitimacy can be\nacquired is through the capacity of legal institutions effectively to\nimpose solutions to various societal problems\u2014such as\nco-ordination problems regarding environmental\nprotection\u2014through its capacity to enforce the standards it lays\ndown. This reveals the familiar substantive dependence of de\njure legitimacy on de facto legitimacy: the fact that\nthe subjects of law are likely to comply with it enhances its\nlegitimacy. Some have questioned whether international law can claim\nany legitimacy given the absence of reliable enforcement mechanisms\n(Posner 2009). This is a problem that is especially acute in the area\nof international human rights law, since the usual expedient of a\ntit-for-tat response to another state\u2019s defection from the law\nseems out of place here. It will hardly be an incentive for state X to\ncomply with international human rights law if state Y threatens\nnon-compliance in relation to its own citizens.\n\nBut even in the case of international human rights law, various\nresponses have been offered. One line of response calls into question\nthe need for the \u201cenforcement\u201d of international law to be\nglobal in character. The seminal work of Beth Simmons on the\neffectiveness of human rights treaties has shown that, insofar as\nmembership of such treaty regimes tends to enhance human rights\ncompliance, the mechanisms through which this is achieved are\nprimarily those of domestic politics rather than a \u201cwhite\nknight\u201d foreign state or international agents (Simmons 2009).\nMore generally, as we saw above (\u00a72.1), states in general tend to\nconform with their international legal obligations (Henkin 1979: 47).\nAnother line of response appeals not to the effectiveness of\ninternational law, but its supposed epistemic superiority, deriving\nfrom its pooling of cross-cultural knowledge in identifying solutions\nto common problems, such as the content of human rights (Buchanan\n2008). However, it is doubtful that a bare claim to epistemic\nsuperiority can justify a claim to practical, as opposed to\ntheoretical, authority, i.e., a claim about what we have reason to do,\nas opposed to what we have reason to believe (Tasioulas 2013).\n",
