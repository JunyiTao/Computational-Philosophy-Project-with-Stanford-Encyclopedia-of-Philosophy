    "main_text": "Value and Justification of Friendship || Social Value\n3. Friendship and Moral Theory\n\nA growing body of research since the mid-1970s questions the\nrelationship between the phenomenon of friendship and particular moral\ntheories. Thus, many (Stocker 1976, 1981;\u00a0Blum 1980, 1993; Wilcox\n1987; Friedman 1989, 1993; Badhwar 1991; Cocking & Oakley 1995)\nhave criticized consequentialist and deontological moral theories on\nthe grounds that they are somehow incompatible with friendship and the\nkind of reasons and motives that friendship provides. Often, the\nappeal to friendship is intended to bypass traditional disputes among\nmajor types of moral theories (consequentialism, deontology, and\nvirtue ethics), and so the \u201cfriendship critique\u201d may seem\nespecially important and\n interesting.[7]\n\nAt the root of these questions concerning the relationship between\nfriendship and morality is the idea that friendship involves\nspecial duties: duties for specific people that arise out of\nthe relationship of friendship. Thus, it seems that we have\nobligations to aid and support our friends that go well beyond those\nwe have to help strangers because they are our friends, much like we\nparents have special duties to aid and support our children because\nthey are our children. Indeed, Annis (1987) suggests, such duties\n\u201care constitutive of the relationship\u201d of friendship (352;\nbut see Bernstein (2007) for an argument that friendship does not\ninvolve any requirement of partiality). Given this, the question\narises as to what the relationship is between such special duties of\nfriendship and other duties, in particular moral duties: can our\nobligations to our friends sometimes trump our moral duties, or must\nwe always subordinate our personal relationships to morality in order\nto be properly impartial (as, it might be thought, morality\ndemands)?\n\nOne concern in this neighborhood, articulated by Stocker (1976), is\nthat the phenomenon of friendship reveals that consequentialist and\ndeontological moral theories, by offering accounts of what it is right\nto do irrespective of the motives we have, promote a kind of\n\u201cmoral schizophrenia\u201d: a split between our moral\nreasons on the one hand and our motives on the other. Such moral\nschizophrenia, Stocker argues, prevents us in general from harmonizing\nour moral reasons and our motives, and it does so in a way that\ndestroys the very possibility of our having and sustaining friendships\nwith others. Given the manifest value of friendship in our lives, this\nis clearly a serious problem with these moral theories.\n\nWhat is it about friendship that generates these problems? One concern\narises out of the teleological conception of action, implicit\nin consequentialism, according to which actions are understood in\nterms of their ends or purposes. The trouble is, Stocker (1981)\nargues, the characteristic actions of friendship cannot be understood\nin this way. To be a friend is at least sometimes to be motivated to\nact out of a concern for your friend as this individual (cf.\n Section 1.1).\n Although actions done out of friendship may have ends, what\ncharacterizes these as \u201cfriendly acts,\u201d as we might call\nthem, is not that they are done for any particular purpose:\n\nIf acting out of friendship is composed of purposes, dispositions to\nhave purposes, and the like, where these are purposes properly\nso-called, and thus not essentially described by the phrase \u2018out\nof friendship\u2019, there seems \u2026 no guarantee that the\nperson cares about and likes, has friendship for, the\n\u2018friend\u2019. [Stocker 1981, 756\u201357]\n\n\nThat is, actions done out of friendship are essentially actions\nmotivated by a special sort of concern\u2014a concern for this\nparticular person\u2014which is in part a matter of having settled\nhabits of response to the friend. This, Stocker concludes, is a kind\nof motivation for action that a teleological conception of action\ncannot countenance, resulting in moral schizophrenia. (Jeske (2008)\nargues for a somewhat different conclusion: that in order to heal this\napparent split between impartial moral obligations and the partial\nobligations of friendship, we must abandon the distinction between\nmoral and nonmoral obligations.)\n\nStocker (1976) raises another, more general concern for\nconsequentialism and deontology arising out of a conception of\nfriendship. Thus, although act consequentialists\u2014those\nwho justify each particular act by appeal to the goodness of the\nconsequences of that act, impersonally conceived (see the entry on\n consequentialism)\u2014could\n justify friendly acts, they \u201ccannot embody their reason in\ntheir motive\u201d (1976, 70), for to be motivated teleologically by\nthe concern to maximize goodness is not to be motivated out of\nfriendship. Consequently, either act consequentialists must exhibit\nmoral schizophrenia, or, to avoid it, they must understand\nconsequentialist reasons for action to be our motives. However,\nbecause such consequentialist reasons are impersonal, taking this\nlatter tack would be to leave out the kind of reasons and motives that\nare central to friendship, thereby undermining the very institution of\nfriendship. (Cf. the discussion of impersonal justification of\nfriendship and the problem of fungibility in\n Section 2.1.)\n\nThe same is true, Stocker argues, of rule consequentialism\n(the view that actions are right if they follow principles or rules\nthat tend to result in the most good overall, impersonally\nconceived\u2014see the entry on\n rule-consequentialism)\n and on deontology (the view that actions are right just in\ncase they are in accordance with certain rules or principles that are\nbinding on all moral agents). For even if rule consequentialism and\ndeontology can provide moral reasons for friendly actions in terms of\nthe rule that one must benefit one\u2019s friends, for example, such\nreasons would be impersonal, giving no special consideration to our\nparticular friends at all. If we are to avoid moral schizophrenia and\nembody this reason in our motives for action, we could not, then, act\nout of friendship\u2014out of a concern for our friends for their\nsakes. This means that any rule consequentialist or deontologist that\navoids moral schizophrenia can act so as to benefit her friends, but\nsuch actions would be merely as if friendly, not genuinely\nfriendly, and she could not therefore have and sustain genuine\nfriendships. The only alternative is to split her moral reasons and\nher motives for friendly acts, thereby becoming schizophrenic. (For\nsome discussion about whether such moral schizophrenia really is as\nbad as Stocker thinks, see Woodcock 2010. For concerns similar to\nStocker\u2019s about impartial moral theories and motivation for\naction arising out of a consideration of personal relationships like\nfriendship, see Williams 1981.)\n\nBlum (1980) (portions of which are reprinted with slight modifications\nin Blum 1993) and Friedman (1993), pick up on this contrast between\nthe impartiality of consequentialism and deontology and the inherent\npartiality of friendship, and argue more directly for a rejection of\nsuch moral theories. Consequentialists and deontologists must think\nthat relationships like friendship essentially involve a kind of\nspecial concern for the friend and that such relationships therefore\ndemand that one\u2019s actions exhibit a kind of partiality towards\nthe friend. Consequently, they argue, these impartialist moral\ntheories must understand friendship to be inherently biased and\ntherefore not to be inherently moral. Rather, such moral theories can\nonly claim that to care for another \u201cin a fully morally\nappropriate manner\u201d requires caring for him \u201csimply as a\nhuman being, i.e., independent of any special connection or attachment\none has with him\u201d (Blum 1993, 206). It is this claim that Blum\nand Friedman deny: although such universalist concern surely has a\nplace in moral theory, the value\u2014indeed the moral value (cf.\n Section 2.2)\u2014of\n friendship cannot properly be appreciated except as involving a\nconcern for another for his sake and as the particular person he is.\nThus, they claim, insofar as consequentialism and deontology are\nunable to acknowledge the moral value of friendship, they cannot be\nadequate moral theories and ought to be rejected in favor of some\nalternative.\n\nIn reply, Railton (1984) distinguishes between subjective and\nobjective consequentialism, arguing that this \u201cfriendship\ncritique\u201d of Stocker and Blum (as well as Friedman) succeeds\nonly against subjective consequentialism. (See Mason (1998) for\nfurther elaborations of this argument, and see Sadler (2006) for an\nalternative response.) Subjective consequentialism is the\nview that whenever we face a choice of actions, we should both morally\njustify a particular course of action and be motivated to act\naccordingly directly by the relevant consequentialist principle\n(whether what that principle assesses are particular actions or rules\nfor action). That is, in acting as one ought, one\u2019s subjective\nmotivations ought to come from those very moral reasons: because this\naction promotes the most good (or is in accordance with the rule that\ntends to promote the most good). Clearly, Stocker, Blum, and Friedman\nare right to think that subjective consequentialism cannot properly\naccommodate the motives of friendship.\n\nBy contrast, Railton argues, objective consequentialism\ndenies that there is such a tight connection between the objective\njustification of a state of affairs in terms of its consequences and\nthe agent\u2019s motives in acting: the moral justification of a\nparticular action is one thing (and to be undertaken in\nconsequentialist terms), but the motives for that action may be\nentirely separate. This means that the objective consequentialist can\nproperly acknowledge that sometimes the best states of affairs result\nnot just from undertaking certain behaviors, but from undertaking them\nwith certain motives, including motives that are essentially personal.\nIn particular, Railton argues, the world would be a better place if\neach of us had dispositions to act so as to benefit our friends out of\na concern for their good (and not the general good). So, on\nconsequentialist grounds each of us has moral reasons to inculcate\nsuch a disposition to friendliness, and when the moment arrives that\ndisposition will be engaged, so that we are motivated to act out of a\nconcern for our friends rather than out of an impersonal, impartial\nconcern for the greater\n good.[8]\n Moreover, there is no split between our moral reasons for action and\nour motives because such reasons may in some cases (such as that of a\nfriendly act) require that in acting we act out of the appropriate\nsort of motive. So the friendship critique of Stocker, Blum, and\nFriedman\n fails.[9]\n\nBadhwar (1991) thinks even Railton\u2019s more sophisticated\nconsequentialism ultimately fails to accommodate the phenomenon of\nfriendship, and that the moral schizophrenia remains. For, she argues,\na sophisticated consequentialist must both value the friend for the\nfriend\u2019s sake (in order to be a friend at all) and value the\nfriend only so long as doing so is consistent with promoting the most\ngood overall (in order to be a consequentialist).\n\nAs a non-schizophrenic, un-self-deceived consequentialist friend,\nhowever, she must put the two thoughts together. And the two thoughts\nare logically incompatible. To be consistent she must think, \u201cAs\na consequentialist friend, I place special value on you so long, but\nonly so long, as valuing you thus promotes the overall good.\u201d\n\u2026 Her motivational structure, in other words, is instrumental,\nand so logically incompatible with the logical structure required for\nend friendship. [493]\n\n\nBadhwar is here alluding to a case of Railton\u2019s in which,\nthrough no fault of yours or your friend\u2019s, the right action\naccording to consequentialism is to sacrifice your friendship for the\ngreater good. In such a case, the sophisticated consequentialist must\nin arriving at this conclusion \u201cevaluate intrinsic goods [of\nfriendship] and their virtues by reference to a standard external to\nthem\u201d\u2014i.e., by reference to the overall good as this is\nconceived from an impersonal point of view (496). However, Badhwar\nargues, the value of friendship is something we can appreciate only\nfrom a personal point of view, so that the moral rightness of friendly\nactions must be assessed only by appeal to an essentially personal\nrelationship in which we act for the sake of our friends and not for\nthe sake of producing the most good in general and in indifference to\nthis particular personal relationship. Therefore, sophisticated\nconsequentialism, because of its impersonal nature, blinds us to the\nvalue of particular friendships and the moral reasons they provide for\nacting out of friendship, all of which can be properly appreciated\nonly from the personal point of view. In so doing, sophisticated\nconsequentialism undermines what is distinctive about friendship as\nsuch. The trouble once again is a split between consequentialist\nreasons and friendly motivations: a kind of moral schizophrenia.\n\nAt this point it might seem that the proper consequentialist reply to\nthis line of criticism is to refuse to accept the claim that a moral\njustification of the value of friendship and friendly actions must be\npersonal: the good of friendship and the good that friendly actions\npromote, a consequentialist should say, are things we must be able to\nunderstand in impersonal terms or they would not enter into a properly\nmoral justification of the rightness of action. Because\nsophisticated consequentialists agree that motivation out of\nfriendship must be personal, they must reject the idea that the\nultimate moral reasons for acting in these cases are your motives,\nthereby rejecting the relatively weak motivational internalism that is\nimplicit in the friendship critique (for weak motivational\ninternalism, see the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism,\n and in particular the section on\n motivational internalism and the action-guiding character of moral judgements).\n Indeed, this seems to be Railton\u2019s strategy in articulating his\nobjective consequentialism: to be a good person is to act in\nthe morally right ways (justified by consequentialism) and so to have,\non balance, motivations that tend to produce right action, even though\nin certain cases (including those of friendship) these motivations\nneed not\u2014indeed cannot\u2014have the consequentialist\njustification in view. (For further elaborations of this strategy in\ndirect response to Badhwar 1991, see Conee 2001 and Card 2004; for a\ndefense of Railton in opposition to Card\u2019s elaboration of\nsophisticated consequentialism, see Tedesco 2006.)\n\nThis means that the debate at issue in the friendship critique of\nconsequentialism needs to be carried on in part at the level of a\ndiscussion of the nature of motivation and the connection between\nmoral reasons and motives. Indeed, such a discussion has implications\nfor how we should construe the sort of mutual caring that is central\nto friendship. For the sophisticated consequentialist would presumably\ntry to spell out that mutual caring in terms of friendly dispositions\n(motives divorced from consequentialist reasons), an attempt which\nadvocates of the friendship critique would say involves insufficient\nattention to the particular person one cares about, insofar as the\ncaring would not be justified by who she is (motives informed by\npersonal reasons).\n\nThe discussion of friendship and moral theories has so far\nconcentrated on the nature of practical reason. A similar debate\nfocuses on the nature of value. Scanlon (1998) uses friendship to\nargue against what he calls teleological conceptions of values\npresupposed by consequentialism. The teleological view understands\nstates of affairs to have intrinsic value, and our recognition of such\nvalue provides us with reasons to bring such states of affairs into\nexistence and to sustain and promote them. Scanlon argues that\nfriendship involves kinds of reasons\u2014of loyalty, for\nexample\u2014are not teleological in this way, and so the value of\nfriendship does not fit into the teleological conception and so cannot\nbe properly recognized by consequentialism. In responding to this\nargument, Hurka (2006) argues that this argument presupposes\na conception of the value of friendship (as something we ought to\nrespect as well as to promote) that is at odds with the teleological\nconception of value and so with teleological conceptions of\nfriendship. Consequently, the debate must shift to the more general\nquestion about the nature of value and cannot be carried out simply by\nattending to friendship.\n\nThese conclusions that we must turn to broader issues if we are to\nsettle the place friendship has in morality reveal that in one sense\nthe friendship critique has failed: it has not succeeded in making an\nend run around traditional debates between consequentialists,\ndeontologists, and virtue theorists. Yet in a larger sense it has\nsucceeded: it has forced these moral theories to take personal\nrelationships seriously and consequently to refine and complicate\ntheir accounts in the process.\n",
