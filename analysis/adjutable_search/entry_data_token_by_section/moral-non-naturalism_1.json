    "main_text": "The Open Question Argument\n2. The Open Question Argument\n\n\nMoore\u2019s \u201cOpen Question Argument\u201d for the conclusion that goodness is a\nnon-natural property is closely related to his worries about the\nnaturalistic fallacy. Consider any proposed naturalistic analysis N of\na moral predicate M. The Open Question Argument maintains that it will\nalways be possible for someone competent with moral discourse without\nconceptual confusion to grant that something is N but still wonder\nwhether it is really M. Whether goodness is co-instantiated with any\nnatural property or set of natural properties is in this sense always\na conceptually open question. If, however, N really was an accurate\nanalysis of M then the question, \u201cI know it is N but is it M?\u201d would\nnot be open in this way for a conceptually competent judge any more\nthan the question, \u201cI know he is a bachelor but is he unmarried?\u201d can\nbe an open one. Moore himself used the Open Question Argument to\ndefend a non-naturalist account of goodness but held that rightness\nwas reducible to goodness. Moore held that it was true by definition\nthat right actions maximize goodness, though he later came to the\nconclusion that this definition of rightness was also vulnerable to an\nOpen Question Argument. A very similar argument was used by Sidgwick\nto establish that certain moral notions are irreducible (see Sidgwick\n1907: Book I, Chapter 3) and Moore credits Sidgwick with the idea\n(Moore 1903: 17). More recently, some philosophers have argued that\nnaturalism cannot capture the normativity of moral properties, and\nthese arguments also seem to be very similar to the Open Question\nArgument. The idea seems to be that for any naturalistic reduction one\noffers of some seemingly normative notion one can, without betraying\nany conceptual incompetence, admit that something has the property\nspecified by the reductive account but hold that this lacks\nnormativity\u2014does not provide any reasons for action (see Dancy\n1996: 180\u2013183). \n\n\nOn its face, the Open Question Argument seems to beg the question\nagainst the naturalist just as much as the charge of a naturalistic\nfallacy. For if the naturalist holds that a given moral predicate M is\nequivalent in meaning to some definition N couched entirely in\nnon-moral predicates then she is obviously committed to holding that\nthe relevant questions are not open and the naturalist might therefore\nsimply deny the main premise of Moore\u2019s argument. However, the Open\nQuestion Argument can be given a non-question-begging interpretation.\nThe crucial move is to understand the argument as an argument to the\nbest explanation. On this interpretation, the main premise of the\nargument is not that the relevant questions are conceptually open, but\nthe much more modest premise that they at least seem conceptually open\nto competent users of moral terms. The argument then proceeds to claim\nthat the best explanation of its seeming to competent users of the\nterms that these questions are open is that they really are open. That\nis, after all, a relatively simple and direct explanation of the\nphenomenon and the sort of explanation that we seem to accept by\ndefault when considering conceptual questions in general. This argument\ndoes not beg the question insofar as the opponent of non-naturalism can\ngrant that the relevant questions do seem open without thereby\ncontradicting their position\u2014the main premise of this argument does\nnot directly entail non-naturalism.\n\n\nOnce again, however, the scope of the argument is not as great as\nMoore supposed. For anti-reductionist forms of naturalism (like Sturgeon\u2019s) seem as invulnerable to the argument as Moore\u2019s\nnon-naturalist account. Still, if the argument were to defeat all\nreductionist forms of naturalism that would be of substantial interest\nand might well be part of larger argument for non-naturalism when\ncombined with an independent argument against anti-reductionist forms\nof naturalism (for further discussion, see Ball 1988, Ball 1991 and\nBaldwin 1990: 87\u201389).\n\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Open Question Argument so understood\nstill faces an impressive battery of objections. Perhaps the meaning of\na predicate is not as transparent to competent users of the predicate\nas Moore implicitly assumes. For example, some have argued that\ncompetence with a predicate consists in being disposed (for the most\npart) to use the predicate only in ways that are consistent with\ncertain \u201cplatitudes\u201d in which the predicate figures (see, e.g. Jackson\nand Pettit 1995). A correct definition of the term might then be\nunderstood as one that best explains those platitudes. On this sort of\naccount a competent user of moral terms might respect the platitudes\nbut not recognize the theory that best explicates those platitudes even\nif presented with it. An analogy with grammar illustrates the point.\nLet us suppose that competent speakers are ones who are disposed (for\nthe most part) to follow certain grammatical rules but they might not\nrecognize those rules as valid when presented with them. The question,\n\u201cI know the sentence violates this rule but is it ungrammatical?\u201d might\ntherefore seem to them to be an open one and there need be no mystery\nin this. The same might be true in the moral case. The non-naturalist\nmight respond to this by arguing that if the proposed \u201cplatitudes\u201d are\nsubstantial enough to fix the reference of moral terms to some natural\nproperty then the platitudes themselves are vulnerable to an Open\nQuestion Argument. The analogy with grammar might seem to break down at\njust this point. For there seems to be much more room for intelligible\nmoral disagreement amongst competent judges in spite of agreement about\neverything else than there is for grammatical disagreement amongst\ncompetent judges in spite of agreement about everything else.\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best explanation of the apparent\n\u201copenness\u201d of the relevant questions to competent users is that the\npredicates do not refer to properties at all. For it might be held that\nmoral predicates do purport to refer to non-natural properties but fail\nto refer precisely because those properties would have to be so queer.\nThis would be to defend a kind of error theory, as defended by John\nMackie (see Mackie 1977 and Joyce 2001). In effect, this would be to\ngrant that the non-naturalist is right about the semantics (moral\npredicates do purport to refer to non-natural properties) but wrong\nabout the metaphysics (the non-naturalist is wrong to suppose moral\npredicates refer to anything).\n\n\nEven more radically, it might be maintained that moral predicates do\nnot even purport to refer to properties and that this explains why the\nrelevant questions seem open. In particular, it has been argued that a\nnon-cognitivist analysis of moral discourse can explain why the\nrelevant questions seem open. The question, \u201cI know its pleasant but is\nit good?\u201d seems open on this account because one can admit that\nsomething is pleasant (or has whatever natural property you like)\nwithout having decided to approve (or disapprove) of the thing in\nquestion. It is easy enough to see why this would also block the\ninference to non-naturalism. For on a non-cognitivist account, as\ntraditionally understood, moral predicates do not even purport to refer\nto properties but rather serve to express speakers\u2019 pro- and\ncon-attitudes. Hence, the non-cognitivist concludes, moral predicates\ndo not refer to properties at all, much less non-natural ones (see,\ne.g., Ayer 1952). In fact, it is fair to say that non-cognitivists\neventually gained at least as much mileage from the Open Question\nArgument as non-naturalists.\n\n\nFinally, more sophisticated forms of reductionist naturalism hold\nthat while moral predicates do refer to natural properties, they do not\nso refer in virtue of any sort of analytic equivalence between moral\npredicates and non-moral predicates. The analogy here is with certain\ntheories of reference borrowed from the discussion of proper names and\nnatural kinds (see, e.g., Boyd 1988). Some philosophers have held that\nidentifications of natural kinds like \u2018water=H2O\u2019 are\nnecessarily true but not analytic. Rather, they are a posteriori\nnecessary truths that hold in virtue of \u2018water\u2019 bearing the\nright causal relation (it has not been easy to say what causal\nrelations are of the right kind) to H2O. Water and H2O may well be the\nsame property but a competent user of \u2018water\u2019 need not know\nthis. Indeed, before the discovery of modern chemistry most users of\n\u2018water\u2019 did not know this and it is not obvious that the\nmeaning of the word changed in light of this discovery. If this is a\nplausible semantic theory and if a similar theory is true of moral\npredicates (a thesis that requires further argument) then the Open\nQuestion Argument is in trouble. For given this semantic theory, just\nas a competent user of \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018H2O\u2019 could\nwithout confusion say, \u201cI know it is H2O but is it water?\u201d a competent\nuser of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018pleasant\u2019 could say, \u201cI\nknow it is pleasant but is it good?\u201d without confusion. Whether this\nsort of causal theory of reference is plausible in the case of moral\nvocabulary is more controversial, but the defender of the Open Question\nArgument needs some reason to reject the analogy.\n",
