    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Origins of Recursive Function Theory and Computability Theory\n1.8 The Origins of Recursive Function Theory and Computability Theory\n\nThe developments just described form part of the prehistory of the\nsubfield of contemporary mathematical logic which was originally known\nas recursive function theory (or more simply as recursion\ntheory). This subject was initiated in earnest by Kleene, Turing,\nand Post starting in the late 1930s, directly on the basis of the\npapers containing the equivalence and undecidability results\nsummarized in\n Section 1.6\n and\n Section 1.7.\n Of particular importance are the papers (1936a, 1938, 1943,\n1955a,b,c) of Kleene. These respectively contain the definition of the\npartial recursive functions, the proof of their equivalence to\n\\(\\mathbf{GR}\\), the Normal Form Theorem, the Recursion Theorem, and\nthe definitions of the arithmetical and analytical hierarchies. Of\nequal importance are the papers (1937, 1939) of Turing (which\nrespectively contain the undecidability of the Halting Problem and the\ndefinition of Turing reducibility) and the paper (1944) of Post (which\nintroduced many-one and one-one reducibility and formulated what would\ncome to be known as Post\u2019s Problem).\n\nThese developments will be surveyed in\n Section 3.\n As we will see there, an important theme in the early stages of\ncomputability theory was the characterization of a notion of effective\ncomputability which is capable of supporting rigorous proofs grounded\nin intuitions about algorithmic calculability but which abstracts away\nfrom the details of the models mentioned in\n Section 1.6.\n To this end, G\u00f6del\u2019s original definition of the general\nrecursive equations was replaced in early textbook treatments (e.g.,\nShoenfield 1967, Rogers 1987) by Kleene\u2019s definition of the\npartial recursive functions in terms of the unbounded minimization\noperator introduced in\n Section 2.2.\n This characterization has in turn been replaced by machine-based\ncharacterizations such as those of Turing (1937) or Shepherdson &\nSturgis (1963) in later textbooks (e.g., Soare 1987, Cutland 1980)\nwhich are closer in form to informally described computer\nprograms.\n\nWhat is retained in these treatments is an understanding of\ncomputation as a means of operating in an effective manner on finite\ncombinatorial objects which can still be understood to fall under the\n\u201crecursive mode of thought\u201d as understood by early\ntheorists such as Skolem, Hilbert, G\u00f6del, and P\u00e9ter. But\nat the same time, many of the basic definitions and results in\nrecursive function theory are only indirectly related to recursive\ndefinability in the informal sense described in this section. In light\nof this, Soare (1996) proposed that recursive function theory should\nbe renamed computability theory and that we should\naccordingly refer to what were traditionally known as the\nrecursive functions as the computable functions.\n\nSuch a change in terminology has been largely adopted in contemporary\npractice and is reflected in recent textbooks such as Cooper (2004)\nand Soare (2016). Nonetheless, both sets of terminology are still\nwidely in use, particularly in philosophical and historical sources.\nReaders are thus advised to keep in mind the terminological discussion\nat the beginning of\n Section 3.\n",
