    "main_text": "Epitome as Philosophical Style\n2. Epitome as Philosophical Style\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s reputation rested on the manner in which he\nintroduced philosophy in commentaries, paraphrases, and\neditions\u2014in other words, on a style of philosophical\nepitome. The late sixteenth-century critic of Aristotelianism\nFrancesco Patrizi observed that Lef\u00e8vre was the first to read\nAristotle without scholastic quaestiones, and historians\nfrequently cite Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s desire, following the\ntranslations of Aristotle by Leonardo Bruni, to\n\n\ndraw up and taste the purest waters from the very spring of\nAristotle\u2019s works (Nunc ergo O iuvenes ex Aristotelico\nopere, ceu ex proprio fonte purissimas haurite, delibateque\naquas),\n\n\nas he exhorted students on the title-page of his 1503 edition of the\nlogical works (see Bianchi 2007: 57n19; Schmitt 1988). He hoped to\nreturn to the source itself, convinced that this would cure philosophy\nof its ills\u2014he described mathematics and the \u201cancient\nwisdom\u201d, for example, as medicines which would prepare\nstudents\u2019 minds properly to approach philosophy (Lef\u00e8vre\n1496a: h7v). He denounced the more innovative elements of traditional\nuniversity logic such as sophismata and instead suggested\nthat students should read his own shorter handbook on logic (1496b) to\nlearn just enough before moving on to more profitable studies. Instead\nof addressing specialized topics or staking out a position within a\nuniversity \u201cschool\u201d, Lef\u00e8vre favored handbooks\nwhich introduced a discipline through brief explanations of terms and\nbasic concepts, ostensibly leaving students with a conceptual\nvocabulary and enough time to read Aristotle on their own.\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s textbooks often deployed several genres in the\nsame volume (Lines 2007). Most visually striking are the synoptic\ntables before each introduction, which at a glance supply a roadmap to\nthe whole work. The table was followed by a paraphrase of the work,\nchapter by chapter, in an effort to reorganize the sinewy contours of\nAristotle\u2019s works in simpler form. Usually Lef\u00e8vre\nprefaced paraphrases with notae, which encapsulated his\njudgement on the most interesting or important insights in the\nchapter; these might be added to philological, historical, or topical\nremarks. Another genre Lef\u00e8vre occasionally used was the\ndialogue, which not only catechized young students in philosophical\ndoctrine, but also demonstrated how teacher and pupil should engage\nwith each other. Finally, when he published an edition of an\nAristotelian treatise, Lef\u00e8vre also wrote a more traditional\ncommentary. Again, he normally proceeded chapter by chapter through\nAristotle\u2019s text, keeping \u201cliteral\u201d comments on\nphilological questions and obscure phrases separate from\nnotae on literary, doctrinal, or methodological issues raised\nin the work.\n\nIn aggregate, this range of epitomizing formats or genres defined a\nRenaissance philosophical style, which Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s works\nremodeled for northern universities. Kessler has argued that when\nLef\u00e8vre met Barbaro and Poliziano in Italy, he also encountered\na new Aristotle: Barbaro had promised his students that he would make\nall of Aristotle accessible to them (Kessler 1999). This was not\nAristotle taken piecemeal, but instead as an author to be digested in\nhis entirety, systematically and compendiously. In his paraphrases\nLef\u00e8vre thus presents an encyclopedic Aristotle. Poliziano, who\nwas lecturing on Aristotle when Lef\u00e8vre visited Florence in\n1491, stands out as a possible precedent for the philological side of\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s encyclopedic enterprise (Celenza 2010).\nPoliziano promised to explain both facts and words, res et\nverba, in Aristotle, giving the account of a\n\u201cgrammarian\u201d, which would represent Aristotle better than\nthe \u201cphilosophical\u201d comments of his university\ncompetitors. This approach to the philological commentary can to some\nextent be traced in Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s literary notes and\ninterpretive comparisons. The idea that Poliziano was a central\ninfluence, however, needs to be treated with caution, since Poliziano\n(as far as we can tell from his surviving praelectiones)\nfocused on what knowledge of Greek could reveal about\nAristotle\u2019s meaning, word by word, with little concern for a\nsynoptic vision of Aristotle\u2019s works, whereas Lef\u00e8vre\naimed to reconstruct Aristotle systematically, as a whole, laying\nemphasis, furthermore, on his coherence with Christian teaching.\n",
