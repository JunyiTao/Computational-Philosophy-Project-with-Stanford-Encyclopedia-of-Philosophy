    "main_text": "Why Justification Logic? || Epistemic Tradition\n1.1 Epistemic Tradition\n\n\nThe properties of knowledge and belief have been a subject for formal\nlogic at least since von Wright and Hintikka, (Hintikka 1962, von \nWright 1951). Knowledge and belief are both treated as modalities in \na way that is now very familiar\u2014Epistemic Logic. But \nof Plato\u2019s three criteria for knowledge, justified, true, \nbelief, (Gettier 1963, Hendricks 2005), epistemic logic really \nworks with only two of them. Possible worlds and indistinguishability\nmodel belief\u2014one believes what is so under all circumstances \nthought possible. Factivity brings a trueness component into \nplay\u2014if something is not so in the actual world it cannot be \nknown, only believed. But there is no representation for the \njustification condition. Nonetheless, the modal approach has been \nremarkably successful in permitting the development of a rich \nmathematical theory and applications, (Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and \nVardi 1995, van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007). Still, it is\nnot the whole picture.\n\n\nThe modal approach to the logic of knowledge is, in a sense, built \naround the universal quantifier: \\(X\\) is known in a situation \nif \\(X\\) is true in all situations indistinguishable \nfrom that one. Justifications, on the other hand, bring an \nexistential quantifier into the picture: \\(X\\) is known in a \nsituation if there exists a justification for \\(X\\) in \nthat situation. This universal/existential dichotomy is a familiar \none to logicians\u2014in formal logics there exists a proof for a \nformula \\(X\\) if and only if \\(X\\) is true in all models \nfor the logic. One thinks of models as inherently non-constructive, \nand proofs as constructive things. One will not go far wrong in \nthinking of justifications in general as much like mathematical \nproofs. Indeed, the first justification logic was explicitly designed\nto capture mathematical proofs in arithmetic, something which will be\ndiscussed further in Section 1.2.\n\n\nIn Justification Logic, in addition to the category of formulas, \nthere is a second category of justifications. Justifications\nare formal terms, built up from constants and variables using various\noperation symbols. Constants represent justifications for commonly \naccepted truths\u2014typically axioms. Variables denote unspecified \njustifications. Different justification logics differ on which \noperations are allowed (and also in other ways too). If \\(t\\) is\na justification term and \\(X\\) is a formula, \n\\(t : X\\) is a formula, and is intended to be read:\n\n  \\(t\\) is a justification for X.\n\n\n\nOne operation, common to all justification logics, is \napplication, written like multiplication. The idea is, if \n\\(s\\) is a justification for \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) and \n\\(t\\) is a justification for \\(A\\), then \n[\\(s\\cdot t\\)] is a justification for \n \\(B\\)[1].\n That is, the validity of the following is generally assumed:\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\ns :( A \\rightarrow B ) \\rightarrow ( t : A \\rightarrow [ s\\cdot t ]: B).\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis is the explicit version of the usual distributivity of knowledge\noperators, and modal operators generally, across implication:\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\Box ( A \\rightarrow B ) \\rightarrow ( \\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box B).\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn fact, formula (2) is behind many of the problems of logical \nomniscience. It asserts that an agent knows everything that is \nimplied by the agent\u2019s knowledge\u2014knowledge is closed under \nconsequence. While knowable-in-principle, knowability, is closed \nunder consequence, the same cannot be said for any plausible version \nof actual knowledge. The distinction between (1) and (2) can be \nexploited in a discussion of the paradigmatic Red Barn Example of \nGoldman and Kripke; here is a simplified version of the story taken \nfrom (Dretske 2005).\n\n  Suppose I am driving through a neighborhood in which, unbeknownst to\n  me, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 barns are scattered, and I see that\n  the object in front of me is a barn. Because I have barn-before-me\n  percepts, I believe that the object in front of me is a barn. Our\n  intuitions suggest that I fail to know barn. But now suppose that\n  the neighborhood has no fake red barns, and I also notice that the\n  object in front of me is red, so I know a red barn is there. This\n  juxtaposition, being a red barn, which I know, entails there being a\n  barn, which I do not, \u201cis an embarrassment\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn the first formalization of the Red Barn Example, logical \nderivation will be performed in a basic modal logic in which \\(\\Box\\)  \nis interpreted as the \u2018belief\u2019 modality. Then some of the\noccurrences of \\(\\Box\\)  will be externally interpreted as \n\u2018knowledge\u2019 according to the problem\u2019s description. Let \n\\(B\\) be the sentence \u2018the object in front of me is a \nbarn\u2019, and let \\(R\\) be the sentence \u2018the object in \nfront of me is red\u2019.\n\n\n    \\(\\Box B\\), \u2018I believe that the object in front of\n    me is a barn\u2019;\n  \n\n    \\(\\Box ( B \\wedge R)\\), \u2018I believe that the\n    object in front of me is a red barn\u2019.\n  \n\n\n\nAt the metalevel, 2 is actually knowledge, whereas by the problem \ndescription, 1 is not knowledge.\n\n\n    \\(\\Box ( B \\wedge R \\rightarrow B)\\), a\n    knowledge assertion of a logical axiom.\n  \n\n\n\nWithin this formalization, it appears that epistemic closure in its\nmodal form (2) is violated: line 2, \\(\\Box ( B \\wedge R )\\), and line\n3, \\(\\Box ( B \\wedge R \\rightarrow B)\\) are cases of knowledge whereas\n\\(\\Box B\\) (line 1) is not knowledge. The modal language here does not\nseem to help resolving this issue.\n\n\nNext consider the Red Barn Example in Justification Logic where \n\\(t : F\\) is interpreted as \u2018I \nbelieve \\(F\\) for reason \\(t\\)\u2019. Let \\(u\\) be a\nspecific individual justification for belief that \\(B\\), and \\(v\\),\nfor belief that \\(B \\wedge R\\). In addition, let \\(a\\) be a\njustification for the logical truth \\(B \\wedge R \\rightarrow B\\). Then\nthe list of assumptions is:\n\n\n    \\(u : B\\), \u2018\\(u\\) is a reason to believe\n    that the object in front of me is a barn\u2019;\n  \n\n    \\(v :( B \\wedge R)\\), \u2018\\(v\\) is a\n    reason to believe that the object in front of me is a red\n    barn\u2019;\n  \n\n    \\(a :( B \\wedge R \\rightarrow B)\\).\n  \n\n\n\nOn the metalevel, the problem description states that 2 and 3 are \ncases of knowledge, and not merely belief, whereas 1 is belief which \nis not knowledge. Here is how the formal reasoning goes:\n\n\n    \\(a :( B \\wedge R \\rightarrow B ) \\rightarrow ( v :( B \\wedge R )\n    \\rightarrow [ a\\cdot v ]: B)\\), by principle (1);\n  \n\n    \\(v :( B \\wedge R ) \\rightarrow [ a \\cdot v ]: B\\), from 3 and 4, by propositional\n    logic;\n  \n\n    [\\(a\\cdot v ]: B\\), from 2 and 5, by\n    propositional logic.\n  \n\n\n\nNotice that conclusion 6 is [\\(a\\cdot v ]: B\\), \nand not \\(u : B\\) ; epistemic closure holds. By reasoning\nin justification logic it was concluded that \n[\\(a\\cdot v ]: B\\) is a case of knowledge, i.e.,\n\u2018I know \\(B\\) for reason \n\\(a\\cdot v\\)\u2019. The fact that \n\\(u : B\\) is not a case of knowledge does not spoil the \nclosure principle, since the latter claims knowledge specifically for\n[\\(a\\cdot v ]: B\\). Hence after observing a red \nfa\u00e7ade, I indeed know \\(B\\), but this knowledge has \nnothing to do with 1, which remains a case of belief rather than of \nknowledge. The justification logic formalization represents the \nsituation fairly.\n\n\nTracking justifications represents the structure of the Red Barn \nExample in a way that is not captured by traditional epistemic modal \ntools. The Justification Logic formalization models what seems to be \nhappening in such a case; closure of knowledge under logical \nentailment is maintained even though \u2018barn\u2019 is not \nperceptually \n known.[2]\n\n",
