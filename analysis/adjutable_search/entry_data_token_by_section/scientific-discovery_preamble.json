    "main_text": "\n\nScientific discovery is the process or product of successful\nscientific inquiry. Objects of discovery can be things, events,\nprocesses, causes, and properties as well as theories and hypotheses\nand their features (their explanatory power, for example). Most\nphilosophical discussions of scientific discoveries focus on the\ngeneration of new hypotheses that fit or explain given data sets or\nallow for the derivation of testable consequences. Philosophical\ndiscussions of scientific discovery have been intricate and complex\nbecause the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d has been used in many\ndifferent ways, both to refer to the outcome and to the procedure of\ninquiry. In the narrowest sense, the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nrefers to the purported \u201ceureka moment\u201d of having a new\ninsight. In the broadest sense, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is a synonym\nfor \u201csuccessful scientific endeavor\u201d tout court. Some\nphilosophical disputes about the nature of scientific discovery\nreflect these terminological variations.\n\nPhilosophical issues related to scientific discovery arise about the\nnature of human creativity, specifically about whether the\n\u201ceureka moment\u201d can be analyzed and about whether there\nare rules (algorithms, guidelines, or heuristics) according to which\nsuch a novel insight can be brought about. Philosophical issues also\narise about the analysis and evaluation of heuristics, about the\ncharacteristics of hypotheses worthy of articulation and testing, and,\non the meta-level, about the nature and scope of philosophical\nanalysis itself. This essay describes the emergence and development of\nthe philosophical problem of scientific discovery and surveys\ndifferent philosophical approaches to understanding scientific\ndiscovery. In doing so, it also illuminates the meta-philosophical\nproblems surrounding the debates, and, incidentally, the changing\nnature of philosophy of science.\n",
