    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || The Observable/Unobservable Distinction\n3.3 The Observable/Unobservable Distinction\n\nA standard type of objection to constructive empiricism, one that was\nespecially prevalent soon after The Scientific Image was\npublished, is the type of objection that takes issue with the clarity\nor cogency of the observable/unobservable distinction. A few examples\nof this type of objection will be presented in this section, along\nwith constructive empiricist replies.\n\nBy the constructive empiricist\u2019s lights, distant macroscopic\nobjects are observable, since if we were nearby we could see them.\nPaul Churchland (1985, 39\u201340) takes issue with the importance\nthe constructive empiricist attaches to size, as opposed to\nspatiotemporal proximity. Churchland points out that it is just a\ncontingent fact that humans have control over their spatiotemporal\nlocation, but not over their size. Churchland concludes that the\ndistinction between things that are unobserved but observable, and\nthings that are unobservable, \u201cis only very feebly principled\nand is wholly inadequate to bear the great weight that van Fraassen\nputs on it\u201d (Churchland 1985, 40).\n\nVan Fraassen replies with the recognition that \u201cscientific\nrealists tend to feel baffled by the idea that our opinion about the\nlimits of perception should play a role in arriving at our epistemic\nattitudes toward science\u201d (1985, 258). Constructive empiricists\nare not asserting any metaphysical difference in the world on the\nbasis of the observable/unobservable distinction; they are just saying\nthat that distinction is relevant to the epistemic attitudes we take.\nSince \u201cexperience is the sole legitimate source of information\nabout the world\u201d (van Fraassen 1985, 258), it makes sense that\nwhat we can experience influences our epistemic attitudes. (Note that\nin his 2002 book The Empirical Stance, van Fraassen calls\ninto question his 1985 statement about experience.)\n\nA different argument by Churchland (1985, 44\u201345) asks what the\nconstructive empiricist would say about beings who are like us except\nthat they are born with electron microscopes permanently attached to\ntheir left eyes. Churchland says that the electron-microscope-eye\nhumanoids would count viruses as part of their ontology, and yet by\nthe constructive empiricist\u2019s lights we can\u2019t, even though\nwe are functionally the same as the humanoids when we put our left eye\nagainst the viewfinder of an electron microscope.\n\nThe constructive empiricist might reply that we are not warranted in\nsaying that the humanoids have the experience of viruses\nunless we already treat the humanoids as being part of our epistemic\ncommunity (van Fraassen 1985, 256\u2013257). If we do expand our\nepistemic community to include them, then the constructive empiricist\nis happy to say that in that situation viruses are observable. But if\nwe do not accept them as part of our epistemic community, then we will\nsimply analyze them as like us, except having electron microscopes\nattached to themselves, and we will say that they are \u201creliable\nindicators of whatever the usual combination of human with electron\nmicroscope reliably indicates\u201d (van Fraassen 1985, 257). In that\ncase the extension of \u2018observable\u2019 is unchanged.\n\nAnother argument calling into question the significance of the\nobservable/unobservable distinction is presented by Ian Hacking (1985,\n146\u2013147). Hacking considers a machine which makes grids of the\nsame shape but various sizes. We can see grids with the same overall\nshape of smaller and smaller size, but the machine makes some grids\nthat are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. When looked at\nthrough a microscope, however, the unobservable grids are seen to have\nthe same shape as the observable ones. Hacking writes:\n\nI know that what I see through the microscope is veridical because we\nmade the grid to be just that way. I know that the process of\nmanufacture is reliable, because we can check the results with the\nmicroscope. Moreover we can check the results with any kind of\nmicroscope, using any of a dozen unrelated physical processes to\nproduce an image. Can we entertain the possibility that, all the same,\nthis is some gigantic coincidence? (Hacking 1985, 146\u2013147)\n\n\nHacking concludes that it would be unreasonable to be an anti-realist\nabout the unobservable grid, and hence we should at least sometimes\nbelieve what science tells us about unobservables.\n\nVan Fraassen (1985, 298) replies by pointing out an unwarranted\nsupposition in Hacking\u2019s argument: the claim that we made the\ngrid to be that way implies what is under dispute, that the grid was\nsuccessfully made to be that way. Regarding the argument that, if\ndifferent types of microscopes make similar observations, then the\nobservations must be veridical, van Fraassen replies that that\nargument\n\nreveals only the unstated premise that the persistent similarities in\nthe relevant phenomena require, must have, a true\nexplanation. (van Fraassen 1985, 298)\n\n\nBut this is a premise that the constructive empiricist rejects.\n\nHere van Fraassen is allowing for the possibility that the\nconstructive empiricist can reasonably be agnostic about the grid. Van\nFraassen replies in a similar fashion to an objection that Paul Teller\nputs forth about the immediacy of objects viewed through a\nmicroscope.\n\nTeller (2007) claims that the images produced by many scientific\ninstruments require some interpretative effort for us to make\nassertions about what it is that we are seeing. What we see through\noptical microscopes, on the other hand, is importantly different. In\nsuch an observation, we take ourselves to see the object being\nmagnified itself, immediately and without interpretative effort.\n\nThe conclusion Teller draws is that contrary to what van Fraassen\nclaims, what is observable extends beyond what members of our\nepistemic community can observe unaided by measuring instruments. What\nis observable minimally also includes the objects viewed through\noptical microscopes, as well as other objects whose observation is\nsimilarly unmediated by interpretation (132\u2013134).\n\nIn reply, van Fraassen (2001) suggests that what we see through a\nmicroscope is akin to reflections seen in mirrors and other reflective\nsurfaces\u2014the reflection of a tree in a body of water, for\ninstance. In both the case of the observation via the microscope and\nthe object viewed in a reflection, we might assert that what we are\nseeing is a real object. But van Fraassen points out an important\ndifference between the reflected object and our observation through\nthe microscope. We are confident that the reflection is of a real\nobject because we can observe certain invariances between the object\npurportedly being observed (the tree), the reflective image, and our\nvantage point. We can, for instance, see that the tree maintains a\ncertain fixed position relative to the reflective body, and we can see\nthat the angle subtended by the lines between us and the two bodies is\na particular function of the observer\u2019s position. The\nobservation of these invariances is possible, in part, because the\ntree is itself observable without the aid of instruments (van Fraassen\n2001, 160).\n\nThat, however, is not true of the objects\u2014the paramecia,\nsay\u2014that are purportedly being observed through the microscope.\nBecause the paramecia are not directly observable without instruments,\nwe can only hypothesize that there are objects being observed for\nwhich the invariant geometric relations hold. It is possible for us,\nthen, to maintain an agnosticism about the paramecia that we\ncan\u2019t about the tree (160). We can regard our observations via\nthe microscope the same way we regard our observations of\nrainbows\u2014namely, as observations of phenomena that are public\n(even capable of being captured by photographic equipment) without at\nthe same time being observations of some existent object (162). (We\nsay that the rainbow is not an actual physical object because it does\nnot participate in the invariant geometric relations we expect of\nactual physical objects: \u201cIf the rainbow were a thing, the\nvarious observations and photos would all locate it in the same place\nin space, at any given time\u201d (157) ).\n\nAlspector-Kelly (2004) claims that there is not the difference\ndescribed here between aided and unaided perception. If the\nconstructive empiricist insists that rainbows, reflections, and the\nlike constitute publicly observable phenomena despite not amounting to\nactually existing objects, then what we experience in the case of\nunaided veridical perception is also some kind of image-like\nobservable phenomena:\n\n\u2026when we look directly at the tree we are also postulating an\nappropriate relation between object, image, and vantage point, namely,\nbetween the tree itself, our perceptual experience of the tree, and\nthe vantage point of our bodily location. (Alspector-Kelly 2004, 336)\n\n\nInsofar as it is appropriate to speak of a perceptual image when\ncharacterizing the view through the microscope\u2014even when, so far\nas the science of microscopy informs us, that view is\nveridical\u2014it is appropriate to speak of a perceptual image when\ncharacterizing naked-eye visualization, even when that view is\nveridical. (Alspector-Kelly 2004, 338)\n\n\nIf this is true, then unaided veridical perception is not\ndistinguished from aided perception in the way van Fraassen suggests.\nUnaided veridical perception is as much mediated by image-like\nobservable phenomena as aided perception is.\n\nAs we will see in \u00a73.6, the constructive empiricist might\nnaturally express skepticism, in the case of unaided veridical\nperception, about the existence of anything like image-like phenomena.\nKusch (2015) points out one reason for skepticism: the phenomena in\nquestion exhibit fewer of the invariant relations\u2014\u201cunlike,\nsay, rainbows, visual experience cannot be photographed\u201d\n(177)\u2014that would allow us to characterize the phenomena as\npublic, verifiable ones capable of empirical study.\n\nA constructive empiricist might also respond to Alspector-Kelly by\nadvocating something like a disjunctivist view of perception, denying\nthat what is observed in the disparate cases really is the same. On\nsuch a view, unaided veridical perception really is of actual physical\nobjects, whereas perception with instrumentation results only in the\nexperience of some kind of publicly observable phenomena akin to\nrainbows and reflections. It remains to be seen whether independent\nmotivation for such a view can help recommend it over the alternative\noffered by the defender of microscopic observables.\n",
