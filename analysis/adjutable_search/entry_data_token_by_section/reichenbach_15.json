    "main_text": "Reichenbach\u2019s Influence\n7. Reichenbach\u2019s Influence\n\nNo complete list of Reichenbach\u2019s doctoral students appears to\nbe available. After coming to UCLA in 1938 he had at least six Ph.D\nstudents known to us. W. Bruce Taylor studied with him between 1949\nand 1953, but we do not know about his subsequent career\u2014he\nlisted no academic affiliation in 1976. Melvin Maron and Norman Martin\nare listed by the Mathematics Genealogy Project as completing their\nPh.D.s with Reichenbach in 1951 and 1952, respectively, but we know of\nno further record for them. Cynthia Shuster became a professor at\nWashington State University, from where she was fired during the\nMcCarthy era for \u201ccorrupting the youth\u201d by inviting Robert\nOppenheimer to speak on campus. She continued her career at the\nUniversity of Montana until her death. Hilary Putnam, who was at\nPrinceton and then Harvard until his retirement, besides other\nimportant contributions less directly connected to Reichenbach,\ncombined Reichenbach\u2019s emphasis on learning in the limit with\nthe theory of computation to create the foundations of computational\nlearning theory, which remains a major theme in theoretical computer\nscience. Until his death, Wesley Salmon, who taught at Washington\nState, UCLA, Northwestern, Brown, Arizona and Pittsburgh, was the\nphilosopher who most prominently and loyally developed and defended\nReichenbach\u2019s views, especially but not exclusively his views on\nprobability and on the justification of induction. Carl Hempel took\nhis doctorate in Berlin with Reichenbach. After moving to the United\nStates, he taught at Yale, Princeton and then Pittsburgh.\nHempel\u2019s work on confirmation was discussed by Reichenbach but\nhad no connection to his own. Early in his career Hempel\u2019s\nthought was more closely connected with Carnap\u2019s logical\napproaches, while his later views were more closely allied with those\nof Thomas Kuhn, and in general his intellectual and personal relations\nwith Reichenbach do not appear to have been close. \n\nSome of Reichenbach\u2019s ideas have reemerged in recent philosophy\nwithout notice of the connection. Michael Strevens\u2019 Bigger\nThan Chaos (Strevens, 2003) reprises the views and arguments of\nReichenbach\u2019s doctoral thesis without the Kantian gloss. Gil\nHarman and Sanjeev Kulkarni\u2019s Reliable Reasoning (2007)\nadopts a view of induction very close to Reichenbach\u2019s. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s views on underdetermination in physics were\ndeveloped extensively by Adolf Grunbaum, but as a metaphysical rather\nthan epistemological thesis. The issue of the conventionality of\nsimultaneity relations has attracted a large philosophical literature.\nReichenbach\u2019s Principle of the Common Cause has attracted\nextensive philosophical comment, much of it devoted to purported\ncounterexamples to a strict universal claim that Reichenbach\nexplicitly denied. Without reference to Reichenbach, the principle was\nrestated in the 1950s by Herbert Simon (1954) as a claim about the\nexplanation of \u201cspurious\u201d correlations. Under the name\n\u201cMarkov condition,\u201d in the early 1980s Reichenbach\u2019s\nprinciple was generalized by several statisticians, most notably Terry\nSpeed (Kiiveri & Speed, 1982), and today plays an essential role\nin representation and search for causal relations. We do not know\nwhether Simon, who had been Carnap\u2019s student at the University\nof Chicago, knew of Reichenbach\u2019s ideas; the statisticians very\nlikely did not. Perhaps not coincidentally, the senior author of this\nentry, who helped to develop the directed graphical representation\ninto search and prediction procedures for causal hypotheses, studied\nwith two of Reichenbach\u2019s doctoral students, Schuster and\nSalmon. As noted above, Reichenbach anticipated formulations of\nprobabilistic causal relevance advanced by Patrick Suppes in A\nProbabilistic Theory of Causality (1970), and the use of\n\u201cmarks\u201d can be found in a somewhat different guise in\nSalmon (1984) and Dowe\u2019s (2000) work on causality. \n\nWith the exception of discussions of the \u201cconventionality\u201d\nof simultaneity, Reichenbach\u2019s Axiomatization seems to\nhave had little influence on subsequent work, whereas Robb\u2019s,\nrediscovered in the 1970s, has attracted some development from both\nphilosophers and physicists. The interventionist account of causation\nin the Axiomatization, and more clearly in The Philosophy\nof Space and Time, has been developed in various ways by several\n21st century writers, without explicit debt to Reichenbach. Michael\nFriedman (2001) has attempted to revive the quasi-Kantian viewpoint of\nReichenbach\u2019s The Theory of Relativity and A Priori\nKnowledge emphasizing the \u201crelativized a priori.\u201d\n\nA considerable literature in linguistics has pursued\nReichenbach\u2019s ideas about the logical form and semantics of\nconversational language, especially about tense and the logical form\nof adverbial modification (see Binnick in the Other Internet Resources\nsection below for a bibliography). Kamp (2013) lays out in some detail\nthe enormous influence in linguistics of Reichenbach\u2019s short\ncomments in Elements of Symbolic Logic (pp. 289\u2013298) that\nrecognized the distinction between speech time, reference\ntime and event time in the logical analysis of tense.\nThus, in the past perfect (\u201chad slept\u201d) the event time\nprecedes reference time, which precedes speech time, while in the\nsimple past (\u201cslept\u201d) the event time coincides with\nreference time, while both precede speech time (see also Malatesta\n2016). The subsequent analysis of reference time and its relation to\nevent time led to the development of formal semantics that could\nhandle a rich representation of context (e.g. Kamp\u2019s own\nDiscourse Representation Theory). In an ambitious book-length study of\nReichenbach\u2019s theory, McMahon (1976) takes Reichenbach\u2019s\nproposal to be a progenitor of Chomsky\u2019s theory of syntax, and\nattempts to supplement Reichenbach\u2019s account with appropriate\nre-write rules. Reichenbach\u2019s own discussion contains no\nexplicit generative grammar or computational models. \n",
