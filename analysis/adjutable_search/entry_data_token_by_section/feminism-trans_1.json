    "main_text": "The Transsexual Phenomenon\n2. The Transsexual Phenomenon\n\n\nUntil 2013, Gender Identity Disorder had been a diagnostic\ncategory in both the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV-TR\n(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and the World\nHealth Organization's ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases\nand Related Health Problems). The newer DSM-V replaces the diagnostic\ncategory Gender Identity Disorder with Gender Dysphoria in an effort\nto lessen stigmatization. Nonetheless, trans experiences continue to\nbe captured by diagnostic categories in manuals which provide criteria\nfor mental disorders.\n\n\nWhile homosexuality was removed from the DSM as a diagnostic\ncategory in 1973, transsexuality was added in the 1980 DSM-III.\nHowever, the view of transsexuality and other trans-related phenomena\nas psychiatric and/or medical conditions has a much longer history. To\nbe sure, not all accounts of trans phenomena were pathologizing\n(indeed, some aimed at political liberation). However, it is clear that\nearly scholarly discussion of trans phenomena unfolded within the field\nof sexology\u2014the \u201cscientific\u201d study of human\nsexuality. Some of the most notable thinkers include Karl Heinrich\nUlrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing ([1886] 1965), Havelock Ellis ([1905]\n1942), and Magnus Hirshfeld ([1910] 1991).\n\n\nIn the early first part of the twentieth century, European\nscientists began to experiment with \u201csex-change\u201d\n(Meyerowitz 2002, 16\u201321). By 1953, media sensation Christine Jorgensen\nhad become the first \u201ccelebrity\u201d MTF transsexual in the\nUnited States and scientific controversy heated over whether\ntranssexuality was a psychological or physical condition (Meyerowitz\n2002). While the former position (then dominant in the U.S.) held that\ntrans phenomena were purely psychological in nature and ought to be\ntreated psychotherapeutically to \u201ccure the mental illness\u201d,\nthe latter (European model) held a \u201cbisexuality theory\u201d\nwhich maintained that there was a physical blend of male and female in\nall human beings and that special cases yielded a\n\u201cmixed-sex\u201d condition which in some cases justified\nsurgical intervention (Meyerowitz 2002, 98\u2013129)\n\n\nWork by John Money, Joan Hampson, and John Hampson on intersexuality\n(the state of having both female and male biological characteristics)\nled to the introduction of the technical term gender\n(1955). They purported to evade the debate between psychology\nand biology, arguing that while the capacity to learn a gender role\nand orientation (like a language) was biologically grounded, the\nspecific native role and orientation learned (like language) was\ncontingent upon social environment which became \u201clocked\ndown\u201d at a very early age (1957). Subsequently, the expression\ngender identity was coined by Robert Stoller and Ralph\nGreenson in 1964, which helped terminologically separate the notion of\nsocial role from psychological sense-of-self. It was ultimately taken\nup by the likes of Money and Harry Benjamin (Meyerowitz 2002,\n117\u20139), and while debate over etiology continued, views allowing\nfor both biology and social environment in determining gender identity\ngained somewhat greater prominence (Meyerowitz 2002, 119). Notably, in\nthese views, gender identity is a biological demand to the extent that\nthe capacity for gender identity (as the capacity for language) is\nviewed as innate. Such a view would seem to suggest that gender, like\nlanguage, is integral to the human self.\n\n\nIn 1966, Benjamin published the landmark The Transsexual\nPhenomenon and that same year saw the opening of the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity program for sex-reassignment surgery, ushering in a period\nof large university-based gender-identity clinics which lasted until\nthe end of the seventies. By the closing of Johns Hopkins in 1979, the\nHarry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (since\nrenamed The World Health Professional Association for Transgender\nHealth or WPATH) had been formed and had approved standardized criteria\nfor the treatment of transsexuals. A year later,\ntranssexualism was added to the DSM.\n\n\nNotably, until the early nineties, the vehicle by which transsexuals\nwrote about their own experiences was largely autobiography. Some\nexamples of these include Canary Conn's The Story of a\nTranssexual (1977), Mario Mario's Emergence: A\nTranssexual Autobiography (1977), and Jan Morris'\nConundrum: An Extraordinary Narrative of Transsexualism\n(1986)\n",
