    "main_text": "Bohr || Bohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty relations\n3.2 Bohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty relations\n\nIn his Como lecture, published in 1928, Bohr gave his own version of a\nderivation of the uncertainty relations between position and momentum\nand between time and energy. He started from the relations\n\n\\[\\tag{13} E = h\\nu \\text{ and } p = h/\\lambda\\]\n\n\n which connect the notions of energy \\(E\\) and momentum\n\\(p\\) from the particle picture with those of frequency \\(\\nu\\) and\nwavelength \\(\\lambda\\) from the wave picture. He noticed that a wave\npacket of limited extension in space and time can only be built up by\nthe superposition of a number of elementary waves with a large range\nof wave numbers and frequencies. Denoting the spatial and temporal\nextensions of the wave packet by \\(\\Delta x\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\), and\nthe extensions in the wave number \\(\\sigma := 1/\\lambda\\) and\nfrequency by \\(\\Delta \\sigma\\) and \\(\\Delta \\nu\\), it follows from\nFourier analysis that in the most favorable case \\(\\Delta x \\Delta\n\\sigma \\approx \\Delta t \\Delta \\nu \\approx 1\\), and, using (13), one\nobtains the relations \n\n\\[\\tag{14} \\Delta t \\Delta E \\approx \\Delta x \\Delta p \\approx h\\]\n\n\nNote that \\(\\Delta x, \\Delta \\sigma\\), etc., are not standard\ndeviations but unspecified measures of the size of a wave packet. (The\noriginal text has equality signs instead of approximate equality\nsigns, but, since Bohr does not define the spreads exactly the use of\napproximate equality signs seems more in line with his intentions.\nMoreover, Bohr himself used approximate equality signs in later\npresentations.) These equations determine, according to Bohr: \n\n\nthe highest possible accuracy in the definition of the energy and\nmomentum of the individuals associated with the wave field. (Bohr\n1928: 571).\n\n\nHe noted, \n\n\nThis circumstance may be regarded as a simple symbolic expression of\nthe complementary nature of the space-time description and the claims\nof causality.\n (ibid).[6]\n\n\n\nWe note a few points about Bohr\u2019s view on the uncertainty\nrelations. First of all, Bohr does not refer to discontinuous\nchanges in the relevant quantities during the measurement\nprocess. Rather, he emphasizes the possibility of defining\nthese quantities. This view is markedly different from\nHeisenberg\u2019s view. A draft version of the Como lecture is even\nmore explicit on the difference between Bohr and Heisenberg:\n\n\nThese reciprocal uncertainty relations were given in a recent paper of\nHeisenberg as the expression of the statistical element which, due to\nthe feature of discontinuity implied in the quantum postulate,\ncharacterizes any interpretation of observations by means of classical\nconcepts. It must be remembered, however, that the uncertainty in\nquestion is not simply a consequence of a discontinuous change of\nenergy and momentum say during an interaction between radiation and\nmaterial particles employed in measuring the space-time coordinates of\nthe individuals. According to the above considerations the question is\nrather that of the impossibility of defining rigorously such a change\nwhen the space-time coordination of the individuals is also\nconsidered. (Bohr 1985: 93)\n\n\nIndeed, Bohr not only rejected Heisenberg\u2019s argument that these\nrelations are due to discontinuous disturbances implied by the act of\nmeasuring, but also his view that the measurement process\ncreates a definite result:\n\n\nThe unaccustomed features of the situation with which we are\nconfronted in quantum theory necessitate the greatest caution as\nregard all questions of terminology. Speaking, as it is often done of\ndisturbing a phenomenon by observation, or even of creating physical\nattributes to objects by measuring processes is liable to be\nconfusing, since all such sentences imply a departure from conventions\nof basic language which even though it can be practical for the sake\nof brevity, can never be unambiguous. (Bohr 1939: 24)\n\n\nNor did he approve of an epistemological formulation or one in terms\nof experimental inaccuracies:\n\n\n[\u2026] a sentence like \u201cwe cannot know both the momentum and\nthe position of an atomic object\u201d raises at once questions as to\nthe physical reality of two such attributes of the object, which can\nbe answered only by referring to the mutual exclusive conditions for\nan unambiguous use of space-time concepts, on the one hand, and\ndynamical conservation laws on the other hand. (Bohr 1948: 315; also\nBohr 1949: 211)\n\nIt would in particular not be out of place in this connection to warn\nagainst a misunderstanding likely to arise when one tries to express\nthe content of Heisenberg\u2019s well-known indeterminacy relation by\nsuch a statement as \u201cthe position and momentum of a particle\ncannot simultaneously be measured with arbitrary accuracy\u201d.\nAccording to such a formulation it would appear as though we had to do\nwith some arbitrary renunciation of the measurement of either the one\nor the other of two well-defined attributes of the object, which would\nnot preclude the possibility of a future theory taking both attributes\ninto account on the lines of the classical physics. (Bohr 1937:\n292)\n\n\nInstead, Bohr always stressed that the uncertainty relations are first\nand foremost an expression of complementarity. This may seem odd since\ncomplementarity is a dichotomic relation between two types of\ndescription whereas the uncertainty relations allow for intermediate\nsituations between two extremes. They \u201cexpress\u201d the\ndichotomy in the sense that if we take the energy and momentum to be\nperfectly well-defined, symbolically \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta p\\) = 0, the\nposition and time variables are completely undefined, \\(\\Delta x =\n\\Delta t = \\infty\\), and vice versa. But they also allow intermediate\nsituations in which the mentioned uncertainties are all non-zero and\nfinite. This more positive aspect of the uncertainty relation is\nmentioned in the Como lecture:\n\n\nAt the same time, however, the general character of this relation\nmakes it possible to a certain extent to reconcile the conservation\nlaws with the space-time coordination of observations, the idea of a\ncoincidence of well-defined events in space-time points being replaced\nby that of unsharply defined individuals within space-time regions.\n(Bohr 1928: 571)\n\n\nHowever, Bohr never followed up on this suggestion that we might be\nable to strike a compromise between the two mutually exclusive modes\nof description in terms of unsharply defined quantities. Indeed, an\nattempt to do so, would take the formalism of quantum theory more\nseriously than the concepts of classical language, and this step Bohr\nrefused to take. Instead, in his later writings he would be content\nwith stating that the uncertainty relations simply defy an unambiguous\ninterpretation in classical terms:\n\n\nThese so-called indeterminacy relations explicitly bear out the\nlimitation of causal analysis, but it is important to recognize that\nno unambiguous interpretation of such a relation can be given in words\nsuited to describe a situation in which physical attributes are\nobjectified in a classical way. (Bohr 1948: 315)\n\n\nFinally, on a more formal level, we note that Bohr\u2019s derivation\ndoes not rely on the commutation relations\n (1)\n and\n (5),\n but on Fourier analysis. These two approaches are equivalent as far\nas the relationship between position and momentum is concerned, but\nthis is not so for time and energy since most physical systems do not\nhave a time operator. Indeed, in his discussion with Einstein (Bohr\n1949), Bohr considered time as a simple classical variable. This even\nholds for his famous discussion of the \u201cclock-in-the-box\u201d\nthought-experiment where the time, as defined by the clock in the box,\nis treated from the point of view of classical general relativity.\nThus, in an approach based on commutation relations, the\nposition-momentum and time-energy uncertainty relations are not on\nequal footing, which is contrary to Bohr\u2019s approach in terms of\nFourier analysis.
