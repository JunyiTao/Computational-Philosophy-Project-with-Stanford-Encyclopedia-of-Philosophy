The \u201cSpheres of Existence\u201d or \u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d\n\nA common way to interpret Kierkegaard\u2019s thought is in terms of\nthree \u201cexistence-spheres\u201d: the aesthetic, the ethical and\nthe religious. The idea that there are precisely three such spheres is\nan over-simplification, as this reckons without important subdivisions\nin this schema (such as different kinds of aesthete; the different\nresonances of especially \u201cthe ethical\u201d in different texts;\nsub-divisions in the religious (\u201cReligiousness A\u201d and\n\u201cReligiousness B\u201d); and the \u201cboundary zones\u201d\nof \u201cirony\u201d and \u201chumor\u201d.) Nonetheless, this\nstructure does give some purchase on Kierkegaard\u2019s view of\ndifferent ways to become\u2014or fail to become\u2014a human\n\u201cself\u201d. Indeed, some have seen \u201cbecoming a\nself\u201d as the key topic of Kierkegaard\u2019s thought,\nand the existence-spheres as crucial to understanding this. One way of\napproaching the existence-spheres is to see them as different views of\nwhat gives a human life value. Kierkegaard often uses an imagery of\nheight in describing the spheres, such as a famous passage in The\nSickness Unto Death in which Anti-Climacus accuses most people of\nliving in a multi-story house and yet preferring to live in the\nbasement (in \u201csensate\u201d categories as opposed to aiming to\nbecome \u201cspirit\u201d) (SUD 43/SKS 11, 158). That is,\nKierkegaard often reads as if the existence-spheres operate in a\nhierarchy, with the aesthetic as \u201clowest\u201d and\nReligiousness B as \u201chighest\u201d. However, this is arguably\ntoo simple: even if Kierkegaard does see the movement from the\naesthetic and the ethical to the religious as progress, it would be a\nmistake to think of this in a purely linear way. There are ways in\nwhich an ethical character such as Judge William may be inferior to an\naesthete such as \u201cA\u201d, and insights to be found in the\naesthetes that are not repudiated or surpassed by what might be\ndescribed as a \u201chigher\u201d pseudonym.\n\nKierkegaard also describes these spheres as \u201cstages\u201d\n(Stadier)\u2014as in the title Stages on Life\u2019s\nWay. The term \u201cstage\u201d might be taken as a\npsychological descriptive term, but this too can be misleading.\nKierkegaard is certainly not simply providing an empirical description\nof how humans develop. It is true that children are natural aesthetes,\nand that this is where human existence always begins. So one might say\nthat a typical human life would begin with aesthetic concerns, develop\nethical commitments, and over time, reflecting on the problems posed\nby ethical existence, could struggle with religious questions which\nare linked to the problems of guilt and suffering that ethical life\nraises but does not solve. However, not everyone follows such a path,\nand even when someone does, the later stages do not simply replace the\nearlier ones. Kierkegaard consistently maintains that all human life\ncontains an aesthetic dimension, so the aesthetic is never really left\nbehind.\n\nFurthermore, humans for Kierkegaard are spiritual creatures, and this\nmeans that the transitions from one stage to another do not happen\nautomatically or inevitably. Rather, the transitions are achievements\nthat require the transformation of the \u201cpassions\u201d that\nshape a human life, what Kierkegaard calls \u201csubjectivity\u201d\nor \u201cinwardness\u201d. It is for this reason that, for instance,\nthe aesthete can choose to remain an aesthete, making this way of life\na rival to an ethical or religious life. When understood in this way\nthe term \u201cspheres\u201d seems superior to \u201cstages\u201d\nas it recognizes that these different views of human existence can be\nrivals, with different views of what makes human life worthwhile and\nmeaningful. Even though Kierkegaard himself clearly believed that deep\nand authentic forms of ethical life point towards the religious, he\nalso recognizes that there are forms of ethical life that are at best\nreligious in a conventional or superficial way (as illustrated,\narguably, by Judge William, to be discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n below). Let us turn, then, to aspects of each of the\n\u201cexistence-spheres\u201d in more detail.\n",
