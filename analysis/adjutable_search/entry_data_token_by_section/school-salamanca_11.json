    "main_text": "Metaphysics and Logic || Su\u00e1rez\u2019s Metaphysics\n8.2 Su\u00e1rez\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597) was\npublished in eighteen editions over a few decades in printing centers\nthroughout Europe\u2014not only in Catholic, but also in Protestant\nregions\u2014and had an enormous influence on philosophy teaching in\nEuropean universities. It is still considered to be the most complete\nand comprehensive presentation of prima philosophia; and it\nwas the most important link between Scholastic metaphysics and\nseventeenth-century school philosophy, influencing Descartes, Leibniz\nand Wolff. Although modern scholars debate the roots of the extremely\ncomplicated system of metaphysics which Su\u00e1rez presents in the\ntreatise, they seem to agree that he created a kind of synthesis of\nThomist and Scotist theories. Only a very general survey of the topics\ndiscussed in Su\u00e1rez\u2019s 54 metaphysical disputations can be\nprovided here, along with a brief mention of some of the most\nimportant approaches to their interpretation.\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s Disputationes do not follow the\nstructure of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. Instead, he\nstarts with an extensive introduction to the Aristotelian treatise,\naccording to a slightly different order than in modern editions, and\nindicates the precise places where the topics discussed there can be\nfound in his disputations. His first disputation reflects on the\nnature metaphysics as prima philosophia. It is followed by\ndisputations on the concept of being (ens), its passions,\ndifferent understandings of unity, on the true and the false, and the\ngood and the bad. The pivotal role that these\n\u201ctranscendentals\u201d of medieval metaphysics play in\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s metaphysics was the basis for the interpretation\nof his theoretical philosophy as transcendental (Honnefelder 1990).\nNext come sixteen disputations dedicated to the four Aristotelian\ncauses (material, formal, efficient and final), followed by the\nvarious divisions of being (infinite and finite, uncreated and\ncreated\u2014including some kind of rational theology which discusses\nquestions such as whether God can be recognized with natural reason\n(Disp. XXIX), whether there are physical proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence (Disp. XXX) etc.\u2014and the division of created being\ninto substance and accidents). Then there are about twenty\ndisputations dealing with the Aristotelian categories, concluding with\none on the special theoretical problems associated with the concept of\nens rationis, which does not belong to any of the previously\ndiscussed categories.\n\nInterpretations of the Disputationes metaphysicae over the\nlast decades have all attempted to fit Su\u00e1rez into a kind of\ntheoretical history (Darge 2004: 7\u201326). Gilson (1949) identified\nan essentialism (according to the Thomist distinction between\nens and essentia) that neglects the act of being in\nfavor of a purely abstract conceptualization and that can be traced in\na line of thinkers from Avicenna through Duns Scotus and Su\u00e1rez\nto Wolff and Kant. Honnefelder (1990) sees Su\u00e1rez as dependent\non the same earlier philosophers, but he does not present it as a\nhistory of decadence from a Thomist perspective, as Gilson did, but\nrather as a success story for the transcendental Scotist approach.\nScotus uses a univocal instead of an analogous concept of being for\ncreated and uncreated substance (i.e., God) and individuates the realm\nof what may be meant by \u201cbeing\u201d, based on the most general\nunderstanding of being as \u201cid cui non repugnat\nesse\u201d, i.e., the existence of which does not imply logical\ncontradictions. Furthermore, he gives a modal explication of the\ndifferent grades of finite and infinite being including the existence\nof finite and infinite substance. Courtine (1990) and Boulnois (1999)\nshare this \u201cScotist perspective\u201d, but they see it more as\na move from the science of what is to the science of what can be\nthought, that is, an onto-logic. Precisely in the years when the term\n\u201contology\u201d was coined by Rudolf Goclenius (Lamanna 2014),\nit no longer referred to the \u201cfurniture of the universe\u201d,\nas Putnam (1985: 28) called it, but instead to ways of thinking and\nspeaking about the things in the world\u2014a process that ends with\nthe determination of what is through our speaking about it. Darge,\nfinally, tries to free Su\u00e1rez from this purely logicistic\ninterpretation and from the Scotist perspective, in order to emphasize\nhis innovative merits against his classification as an intermediate\nfigure between Duns Scotus and Thomas, on the one hand, and Wolff and\nKant, on the other. There is no doubt, however, that\n\u201cRenaissance and Baroque Scholastic culture\u201d, to which\nSu\u00e1rez doubtlessly belongs, has finally become an object of\nserious research (Nov\u00e1k 2014: 2). This research is not only\nproviding a general systematization and historical integration of\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s metaphysics, but also investigating particular\naspects of his extremely rich theory (B. Hill 2012; Nov\u00e1k\n2014).\n",
