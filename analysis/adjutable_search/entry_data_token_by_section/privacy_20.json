Fallis (2013) offers one of the first\ndiscussions of the issue, and criticizes the position that holds that\n\u201cprotecting privacy typically leads to less knowledge\nbeing acquired\u201d, as well as the position that \u201clack of\nknowledge is definitive of having privacy\u201d. He goes on\nto argue that\n\n\ncontra the defenders of the knowledge account of privacy,\nthat someone knowing something is not necessary for someone\nelse losing privacy about that thing. (Fallis 2013: 153)\n\n\nFor Kappel, it\n\n\nseems obvious that informational privacy has an epistemological\ncomponent; privacy or lack of privacy concerns certain kinds of\nepistemic relations between a cogniser and sensitive pieces of\ninformation. (2013: 179)\n\n\nIn his paper, Kappel aims at\n\n\n[shedding] some light on the epistemological component of\ninformational privacy [since] the nature of this epistemological\ncomponent of privacy is only sparsely discussed. (2013: 179; see also\nthe entry on\n privacy and information technology)\n\n4.10 Privacy, Surveillance, and Power\n\nSince the publication of the essay by Warren and Brandeis, there have\nbeen enormous technological advances that have radically transformed\nnot only the possibilities for keeping people under surveillance, but\nalso our concepts of privacy, as well as freedom and autonomy.\nOpportunities for monitoring people are now available in private\nhouseholds, public spaces, and when surfing the Internet. The spaces\nof freedom in the public sphere could not exist under\npermanent (potential) surveillance and social control, and certainly\nnot if we can no longer be sure about what data being collected, and\ninto whose hands it might fall (see Julie Cohen 2008 for more on the\nrelationship between privacy and visibility in the networked\ninformation age). If we can no longer be certain that we are not being\nsurveilled and controlled, then we cannot even openly and\nself-determinedly debate potentially critical positions with\nothers (Stahl 2016: 33\u201339; Rosen 2000: 207). Control and\nstandardization (or normalization) are two sides of the same coin. In\nthe face of increasingly pervasive data collection and digital\nsurveillance, some authors have sought to move away from\nunderstandings of privacy that build on the notions of control over\ninformation or secrecy. Brunton and Nissenbaum, for instance, have\nobserved a variety of practices that sought privacy through\n\u201cobfuscation\u201d, i.e., the \u201cdeliberate addition of\nambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with\nsurveillance and data collection\u201d (2015: 1). The German\nsociologist Carsten Ochs suggests that these obfuscation practices\ncorrespond to a new type of informational privacy, which emerges in\nresponse to the specific challenges of a digitalized society and which\nhe characterizes as \u201cconcealment\u201d\n(\u201cVerschleierung\u201d) (2022: 496).\n\nBrunton and Nissenbaum argue that obfuscation is a\n\n\ntool particularly suited to the \u201cweak\u201d\u2014the\nsituationally disadvantaged, those at the wrong end of asymmetrical\npower relationships. (2015: 9)\n\n It is useful to address the information asymmetry between those\nwho collect data and can use it to monitor, predict and influence\nbehaviors, and those whose data is collected and who may not even be\naware of this data collection and usage (Brunton & Nissenbaum\n2015: 48\u201351). These observations point to the relation between\nprivacy and power, which has received significant attention in the\nrecent literature. The erosion of privacy through data collection and\nprocessing increases the power of big technology companies and\ngovernments to influence the people whose data is collected\n(V\u00e9liz 2020).  Privacy is also a matter of power, insofar as\naccess to privacy is unequally distributed and marginalized groups are\nmore vulnerable than others to privacy invasions. The legal theorist\nSkinner-Thompson (2021) has documented how minority communities, such\nas religious, ethnic or sexual minorities, are disproportionally\nexposed to surveillance due to a lack of legal protections of\nprivacy.\n\nHere, we would also like to draw attention to the computer\nintelligence consultant Edward Snowden, an employee at the NSA, who in\n2013 published highly classified data from the NSA where he was\nworking. These data revealed global surveillance programs by different\nstates and the disclosure prompted many heated cultural debates in\ndifferent countries, as well as international academic debates. From\nthe beginning, one of the questions was whether Snowden had actually\nviolated the privacy of individuals or whether the publication of\nstate secrets should be judged differently than the\npublication of individual secrets; see Mokrosinska on the difference\nbetween secrecy and privacy (Mokrosinska 2020). On the general privacy\nissues involved in this affair, see Greenwald 2014; Rubel 2015;\nMacNish 2018; Lucas 2014. For the general societal debates, the\nSnowden revelations were significant in drawing new attention to\nstructural forms of surveillance and possible violations of\nprivacy.\n\nIn analyses of the new \u201csurveillance state\u201d, many authors\ndiscuss the different social contexts in which violations of\ninformational privacy may in various ways coincide with restrictions\nof freedom. Zuboff (2019) analyses and criticizes the surveillance\ncapitalism and the \u201cinstrumentarian power\u201d of this\nsurveillance state, where privacy is only seen as data and therefore\nas a tradable good. At the same time, she criticizes the process of\ntransforming personal life into behavioral data and commercial\nproducts. For Zuboff, personal data is not a commodity that should be\ntraded arbitrarily, since it is essentially constituted by human\nexperience (see also Roessler 2015; Wang 2022). Susskind\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201cfuture power\u201d as the power to\n\u201cscrutiny\u201d and to \u201cperception-control\u201d (2018)\nis equally critical and pessimistic about the protection of\ninformational privacy in the surveillance state. Similar pessimism is\nexpressed by Harcourt (2015), who conceptualizes the decline and loss\nof privacy as the loss of the individual. At the same time, he calls\nfor forms of civil disobedience in the surveillance state (2015). For\nthe political abuse of data power, see Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison\n(2018) on the so-called Cambridge-Analytica Scandal.\n\nSpecific aspects of the surveillance state are highlighted by authors\nusing the concept of data colonialism, which brings out the persistent\nexploitative power inherent in datafication (Wang 2022). The term\n\u201ccolonialism\u201d is connected to cruel practices of\ndomination and exploitation in human history. As Couldry and Mejias\n(2019) emphasize, \u201cdata colonialism\u201d is not used to\ndescribe the physical violence and force that was often seen in\nhistorical colonialism, but at the same time, the frame of colonialism\nis not used \u201cas a mere metaphor\u201d either. Instead, the term\nis used \u201cto refer a new form of colonialism distinctive of the\ntwenty-first century\u201d (2019: 337), which involves a widespread\ndispossession and exploitation of our human lives. By using the term\n\u201cdata colonialism\u201d instead of \u201cdata\ncapitalism\u201d, or some similar formulation, the crueler side of\n\u201ctoday\u2019s exposure of daily life to capitalist forces of\ndatafication\u201d is highlighted (2019: 337; see also Thatcher,\nO\u2019Sullivan, & Mahmoudi 2016: 994).\n4.11 Privacy, Colonialism, and Racism\n\nMore specifically, racist structures and colonial heritage play a\nconstitutive role in the conceptualization of privacy. Fraser (1992)\nanalyzed the simultaneous constitution of privacy and the public\nsphere, in a cogent interpretation of the hearings for the\nconfirmation of Clarence Hill to the US Supreme Court. Race, sex and\nclass were the determinants of the construction of privacy:\n\n\nThe way the struggle unfolded, moreover, depended at every point on\nwho had the power to successfully and authoritatively define where the\nline between the public and the private would be drawn. It depended as\nwell on who had the power to police and defend that boundary. (Fraser\n1992: 595)\n\n\nNagel (1998a and b), meanwhile, is critical of this theory of\ninterdependence of the concepts privacy and the public sphere, but the\nidea that personal privacy is deeply connected with societal and\npolitical power relations plays an important role in the literature\nfrom the last decade. There has been intensified research on the\nracist and colonial constructions of privacy. Couldry and Mejias\n(2019) generally criticize the relation between big data and the\ncontemporary subject, while Arora (2019) argues more specifically that\nthat many assumptions about internet use in developing countries are\nwrong, since they presuppose a Western conception of this use and the\nidea of privacy in talking about and dealing with the Global South. In\nher work, she analyses the real-life patterns of internet use in\ndifferent countries (among them India and China) and seeks to answer\nquestions why, for instance, citizens of states with strict\nsurveillance policies seem to care so little about their digital\nprivacy (Arora 2019: 717).\n\nTranslating human life into commodified data relations is not new, but\nrather a fact that has been critically examined by many scholars over\nthe years. For example, Shoshana Zuboff (2019) has commented on the\ndrive toward continually increasing data extraction as the essence of\nsurveillance capitalism. From a different angle, Simone Browne\ninterprets the \u201ccondition of blackness\u201d as the key with\nthe help of which state surveillance can precisely record and regulate\nthe lives of subjects. Her book shows exactly how state surveillance\nemerged and learned from practices of colonial exploitation and\nslavery. Surveillance, Browne asserts,\n\n\nis both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries,\nborders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the\nsurveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social\nand political norm. (2015: 1)\n\n\nAgain, from the societal perspective of class and race, Bridges (2017)\ndemonstrates in which ways the protection of personal privacy is\ndeeply connected to class and race, and how it can be used to\nexacerbate the structures of social inequality. She points out that\nthe poor are subject to invasions of privacy that can be perceived as\ngross demonstrations of governmental power without limits.\n4.12 The Future of Privacy\n\nOver the last years, discussions have begun regarding the question of\nwhat lies \u201cbeyond privacy\u201d. Since most big technology\ncompanies have been forced to conform to privacy laws, and even\nadvertise their compliance, a significant question is whether a sort\nof \u201cprivacy-washing\u201d is occurring, where the very focus on\nprivacy undermines the interests which originally initiated those\nprivacy concerns. Projects like \u201cThe Privacy Sandbox\u201d,\nwhere Google, together with the advertisement-technology industry,\ndeveloped seemingly privacy-friendly alternatives to third-party\ncookies, may be seen as cases of \u201cprivacy-washing\u201d. Behind\nthese supposedly good intentions lie fundamental questions about the\nfuture of privacy, as well as the future of the internet. For example,\ndo we even want an internet that runs on personalized advertisements\nand massive data collection? Brunton and Nissenbaum are concerned\nthat\n\n\ninformation collection takes place in asymmetrical power\nrelationships: we rarely have choice as to whether or not we are\nmonitored, what is done with any information that is gathered, or what\nis done to us on the basis of conclusions drawn from that information.\n(2015: 49)\n\n\nSharon demonstrates that\n\n\nin an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as\ngreater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. (2021:\n45)\n\n\nThus, if we look back to the beginnings of informational privacy in\nthe late nineteenth century, we can see that the apparent changes (the\ncorporations themselves seem to care about privacy) express the very\ncontinuities of the threat to privacy. The academic and societal\ndebates about these threats, however, make it clear that privacy has\nby no means lost its value and importance.",
