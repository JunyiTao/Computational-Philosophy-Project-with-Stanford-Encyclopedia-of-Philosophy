Contemporary Feminist Discussions\n\nA systematic examination of gender relations using gender as a\ncategory of analysis is a mark of feminist theorizing. In the\nphilosophical community, this often involves critical re-reading of\nthe canon shedding light on the overt display of misogyny textually,\nhistorically, and culturally in noted canonical thinkers from Plato to\nthe twentieth century (e.g., the \u201cRe-Reading the Canon\u201d\nseries of the Pennsylvania State University Press). But beyond the\ncritical interrogation of the canon\u2019s misogyny, feminists also\nengage in the effort of re-appropriation of the canon for the purpose\nof constructing liberating solutions for gender-based oppression\n(Schott 2003: Ch.1). However, in the theoretical space, feminist\nconsciousness and westernization are more or less synonymous, since\npositive feminist theorizing is largely reliant on western canonical\ntexts. Non-western intellectual traditions, if they are included at\nall, are used as an example of moral depravity to demonstrate the\nplights of \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n",
