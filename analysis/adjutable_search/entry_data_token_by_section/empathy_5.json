    "main_text": "Empathy as the Unique Method of the Human Sciences || The Critique of Empathy within the Context of a Naturalist Conception of the Human Sciences\n3.2 The Critique of Empathy within the Context of a Naturalist Conception of the Human Sciences\n\nPhilosophers, who reject the methodological dualism between the human\nand the natural sciences as argued for in the hermeneutic context, are\ncommonly referred to as naturalists in the philosophy of social\nscience. They deny that the distinction between understanding and\nexplanation points to an important methodological difference. Even in\nthe human or social sciences, the main point of the scientific\nendeavor is to provide epistemically justified explanations (and\npredictions) of observed or recorded events (see also Henderson 1993).\nAt most, empathy is granted a heuristic role in the context of\ndiscovery. It however can not play any role within the context of\njustification. As particularly Hempel (1965) has argued, to explain an\nevent involves\u2014at least implicitly\u2014an appeal to law-like\nregularities providing us with reasons for expecting that an event of\na certain kind will occur under specific circumstances. Empathy might\nallow me to recognize that I would have acted in the same manner as\nsomebody else. Yet it does not epistemically sanction the claim that\nanybody of a particular type or anybody who is in that type of\nsituation will act in this manner.\n\nHempel\u2019s argument against empathy has certainly not gone\nunchallenged. Within the philosophy of history, Dray (1957), following\nCollingwood, has argued that empathy plays an epistemically\nirreducible role, since we explain actions in terms of an\nagent\u2019s reasons. For him, such reason explanations do not appeal\nto empirical generalizations but to normative principles of actions\noutlining how a person should act in a particular situation. Similar\narguments have been articulated by Jaegwon Kim (1984, 1998). Yet as\nStueber (2006, chap. 5) argues such a response to Hempel would require\nus to implausibly conceive of reason explanations as being very\ndifferent from ordinary causal explanations. It would imply that our\nnotions of explanation and causation are ambiguous concepts. Reasons\nthat cause agents to act in the physical world would be conceived of\nas causes in a very different sense than ordinary physical causes.\nMoreover, as Hempel himself suggests, appealing to normative\nprinciples explains at most why a person should have acted in a\ncertain manner. It does not explain why he ultimately acted in that\nway. Consequently, Hempel\u2019s objection against empathy retain\ntheir force as long as one maintains that reason explanations are a\nform of ordinary causal explanations and as long as one conceives of\nthe epistemic justification of such explanations as implicitly\nappealing to some empirical generalizations (For Kim\u2019s recent\nattempt to account for the explanatory character of action\nexplanations by acknowledging the centrality of the first person\nperspective see also Kim 2010). \n\nDespite these concessions to Hempel, Stueber suggests that empathy\n(specifically reenactive empathy) has to be acknowledged as playing a\ncentral role even in the context of justification. For him, folk\npsychological explanations have to be understood as being tied to the\ndomain of rational agency. In contrast to explanations in terms of\nmere inner causes, folk psychological explanations retain their\nexplanatory force only as long as agents\u2019 beliefs and desires\ncan also be understood as reasons for their actions. The epistemic\njustification of such folk psychological explanations implicitly\nrelies on generalizations involving folk psychological notions such as\nbelief and desire. Yet the existence of such generalizations alone\ndoes not establish specific beliefs and desires as reasons for a\nperson\u2019s actions. Elaborating on considerations by Heal (2003)\nand Collingwood (1946), Stueber suggests that recognizing beliefs and\ndesires as reasons requires the interpreter to be sensitive to an\nagent\u2019s other relevant beliefs and desires. Individual thoughts\nfunction as reasons for rational agency only relative to a specific\nframework of an agent\u2019s thoughts that are relevant for\nconsideration in a specific situation. Most plausibly\u2014given our\npersistent inability to solve the frame problem\u2014recognizing\nwhich of another agent\u2019s thoughts are relevant in specific\ncontexts requires the practical ability of reenacting another\nperson\u2019s thoughts in one\u2019s own mind. Empathy\u2019s\ncentral epistemic role has to be admitted, since beliefs and desires\ncan be understood only in this manner as an agent\u2019s reasons (See\nStueber 2006, 2008, 2013. For a related discussion about the role of\nunderstanding in contemporary epistemology and philosophy of science\nsee Grimm 2016 and Grimm, Baumberger, and Ammon 2017). \n",
