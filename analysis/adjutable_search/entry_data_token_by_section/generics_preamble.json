    "main_text": "\n\nGenerics are statements such as \u201ctigers are striped\u201d,\n\u201ca duck lays eggs\u201d, \u201cthe dodo is extinct\u201d, and\n\u201cticks carry Lyme disease\u201d. Generics express\ngeneralizations, but unlike quantified statements, generics do not\ncarry information about how many members of the kind or category have\nthe property. For example, if asked \u201chow many ravens are\nblack?\u201d one could reply \u201call [or some, or most, etc.]\nravens are black\u201d, but one cannot felicitously reply with the\ngeneric \u201cravens are black\u201d (Carlson 1977).\n\nGenerics have proved quite difficult to analyze semantically. For\nexample, \u201cdogs are mammals\u201d seems to require for its truth\nthat all dogs be mammals. \u201cA tiger is striped\u201d or\n\u201cravens are black\u201d, however, are somewhat more forgiving,\nsince they are compatible with the existence of a few stripeless\ntigers and white albino ravens. \u201cDucks lay eggs\u201d and\n\u201ca lion has a mane\u201d are more forgiving still; these\ngenerics are true even though it is only the mature members of one sex\nthat possess the relevant properties. Notice, however, that we do not\naccept \u201cducks are female\u201d, even though every egg-laying\nduck is a female duck. Finally, we accept \u201cticks carry Lyme\ndisease\u201d, even though very few ticks (approximately one percent)\nactually have the property, while also rejecting \u201chumans are\nright-handed\u201d, when over ninety percent of humans are\nright-handed.\n\nAs these examples illustrate, generics are not equivalent in meaning\nto any of the quantifying determiners such as \u201call\u201d,\n\u201csome\u201d, or \u201cmost\u201d. They also differ in meaning\nfrom sentences containing adverbs of quantification (Lewis 1975) such\nas \u201cgenerally\u201d, \u201cusually\u201d, or\n\u201coften\u201d. For example, the generic \u201cbooks are\npaperbacks\u201d is false, yet the insertion of any of these adverbs\nof quantification would render the statement true: \u201cbooks are\ngenerally/usually/often paperbacks\u201d.\n",
