Are all things\npermament or impermanent? Are there selves or no selves? Can we end\nsuffering or can\u2019t we? For Tiantai the right question to be\nasked for understanding and applying doctrine is not \u201cis it\ntrue?\u201d\u2014since all doctrines are \u201ctrue\u201d in this\nsense of \u201cliberating\u201d in some contexts, and not in\nothers\u2014but rather \u201cin what sense, and in what context, is it\ntrue, i.e., liberating?\u201d It is in this connection that we must\nunderstand the Tiantai \u201cclassification of teachings.\u201d\nAmong the many rubrics used for this purpose in traditional Tiantai,\nthe most philosophically important is the classification of the four\ntypes of contents of the Buddha\u2019s teaching\n(\u5316\u6cd5\u56db\u6559), called the Four Teachings, namely,\nTripitaka, Shared, Separate, and Perfect\n\u85cf\uff0c\u901a\uff0c\u5225\uff0c\u5713).\n\nThese four types of content are viewed by Tiantai thinkers not as four\ndifferent teachings, but as really increasingly subtle explications of\none and the same content, the basic Buddhist teaching, via more and\nmore expansive recontextualizations. Tiantai classifies all the\nteachings found in the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist scriptures into\nthese four general types, according to the degree to which they have\ndeveloped the understanding of the basic Buddhist concepts of\nuniversal conditionality, i.e., of Impermanence, Suffering, and\nNon-Self. It should be noted again that all four of these types are\nregarded as \u201ctrue teachings\u201d of the Buddha\u2014true in\nthe sense of validly propounded as a way of liberating sentient beings\nfrom suffering in some particular context\u2014and that all are\nequally also not considered uniquely true\ndescriptions of reality. Moreover, in keeping with the general Tiantai\napproach to interpretation, they are not really different\nteachings at all: they are viewed as alternate expositions of the same\nidea as it is recontextualized, to varying degrees of thoroughness as\nappropriate, even though\u2014as we shall see\u2014they appear\nprima facie to be in direct contradiction to one another. As\nsuch, this schema provides us with a strong general model of the\nTiantai conception of the self-overcoming of suffering, impermanence\nand non-self, wherein they are overcome by remaining exactly as they\nwere, indeed even more so, and thereby are revealed to also be their\nown opposites.\n\nZhiyi takes an obscure passage from a Chinese translation of the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101na\nS\u016btra as one of his models for these four expositions.\n\nLiterally, the passage reads as follows:\n\n \n(Reality) cannot be described in terms of the arising of what\narises.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the non-arising of what\narises.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the arising of\nnon-arising.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of the non-arising of\nnon-arising.\n \nIt cannot be described in terms of arising or non-arising [in any\nof these ways].\n \nYet under the right circumstances it can be validly described in\nterms of any of these.\n\n\nThe passage can be somewhat more venturesomely translated as\nfollows:\n\n \nThe generated generates: that cannot be said.\n \nThe generated is ungenerated: that cannot be said.\n \nThe ungenerated generates: that cannot be said.\n \nThe ungenerated ungenerates: that cannot be said.\n \nIt cannot be said that there is either generation or the\nungenerated in any of these ways.\n \nAlthough all four of these cannot be said, yet any of them\ncan be said under the right circumstances [i.e., none is\nliterally or absolutely valid, but all are conventionally\nvalid\u2014i.e., pragmatically effective in leading to\nliberation\u2014in certain situations].\n\n\n \n\u751f\u751f\n\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u751f\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e0d\u751f\u4ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u56e0\u7de3\u6545\u53ef\u5f97\u8aaa\n\n\nFor Zhiyi this passage gives more than a standard Buddhist negation of\nthe tetralemma followed by its provisional affirmation. Instead, he\nlinks these four positions to the following four general categories,\neach with its own distinct way of understanding the Four Noble Truths,\nand therefore its own way of understanding the nature of all things,\nthe nature of all conditional events, of both the arising and\nperishing of suffering (i.e., of all ordinary experience), of both\nsuffering and liberation from suffering, and of how they are\nrelated:\n\n1. Tripitaka Teaching \u85cf\u6559: \u201cThe Generated\nGenerates\u201d \u751f\u751f, or literally, \u201cThe arising of\nwhat arises.\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experience of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering\u2014actually arise and\nperish. (shengmie sidi\n\u751f\u6ec5\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nAll things are empty in that they are impermanent, and vanish without\nremainder when analyzed and dissolved into their parts\n(\u201canalytic emptiness\u201d\nxikong\u6790\u7a7a).\n\n2. Shared Teaching \u901a\u6559\uff1a: The [Apparently]\nGenerated [Actually] is Ungenerated \u751f\u4e0d\u751f, or\nliterally, \u201cthe non-arising of what arises.\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths\u2014i,e., all conditional\nexperiences of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering\u2014do not arise [or\nperish]. (wusheng sidi\n\u7121\u751f\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nAll things are empty in their very nature from the beginning (whether\nliterally impermanent and dissolved into parts or not)\n(\u201cemptiness embodied right in the thing,\u201d tikong\n\u9ad4\u7a7a).\n\n3. Separate Teaching \u5225\u6559: The [Previously Established]\nUngenerated Generates [Infinitely] \u4e0d\u751f\u751f, or\nliterally, \u201cthe arisings of what does not arise\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of the\nUnconditioned which is liberation from suffering\u2014can be validly\ndescribed not only as \u201creally\u201d empty of any determinations\nof their own and thus neither arising nor perishing, but also, because\nthey are also aspects of the compassionate liberative work of a\nbodhisattva, in an infinity of alternate ways. (wuliang\nsidi \u7121\u91cf\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nThe previous characterizations of things as empty or as non-empty were\nboth one-sided, as things are in reality neither empty nor non-empty.\nRather, both Emptiness and all non-empty things are manifestations\n\u201cthe Center,\u201d a tertium quid which is\nbeyond but also includes both the ungenerated aspect and the generated\naspect, at once both form and formless, the constant infinite\nproductions of forms by the formless, formlessness present only as the\ninfinity of forms. It is the collapsing of emptiness and non-emptiness\ninto something that is immediately both: their unity, which is the\nreal source of both: this is the Buddha-nature as \u201cExclusive\nCenter\u201d danzhong foxing\n\u4f46\u4e2d\u4f5b\u6027, hidden beneath the two extremes, the\ninner kernel of all phenomena, as their source and ultimate\nreality.\n\n4. Perfect Teaching \u5713\u6559: The (infinite things generated\nby the) Ungenerated (are also) Ungenerated\n\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u751f, or literally, \u201cthe\nnon-arisings of the non-arising.\u201d\n\nThe things described by the Four Noble Truths \u2013 i.e., all\nconditional experiences of suffering as well as the experience of\nliberation from suffering\u2014in all those infinite alternate forms, are\n[actually, in their very infinite production,] unmade and unbegun (and\nunfinishable). (wuzuo sidi\n\u7121\u4f5c\u56db\u8ae6)\n\nEach thing is empty, non-empty, and the Center. Each thing is neither\nempty, non-empty, nor the Center. Each thing is entirely and only\nempty. Each thing is entirely and only non-empty. Each thing is\nentirely and only the Center. Each thing subsumes all the others. Each\nthing is subsumed by all the others. Each of the previous sentences in\nthis paragraph are synonyms. Not only each thing: the aspect of\nemptiness itself is empty, non-empty, and Center, and considered\npurely on its own terms is not only the negation of all things but\nalso, when fully thought through, the positing of all things\n(non-empty) and the identity of positing and negation (Center). The\nsame is true for the aspect of non-emptiness, and Center: each one\nalone is all three. This is the \u201cNon-Exclusive Center.\u201d\nbudanzhong \u4e0d\u4f46\u4e2d\u4f5b\u6027 Because\nit is what a Buddha lives and realizes, it is also called \u201cthe\nBuddha-nature\u201d. Each thing is the center of the universe, the\nsubstance of which all other things are attributes. Each is the source\ngenerating all things, but also inherently contains all things within\nitself so that it generates nothing, and likewise being generated by,\nand contained by, any other thing. Each thing is readable equally as\nany other thing. Each thing is also the end toward which all other\nthings tend, the telos of all things. A more detailed\nexposition of these four positions, and their relation to each other,\nis given in the following supplementary document:\n\nFour Teachings\n\n",
