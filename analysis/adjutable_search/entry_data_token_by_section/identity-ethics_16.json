Methodological Alternatives\n\n\nRecall that both Reid and Butler objected to Locke's account of \npersonal identity, in part, because they thought it had absurdly \nrevisionary implications for our practices of moral responsibility. \nSo rather than give up those practices, they said, we would be better\noff giving up Locke's theory. On this view, our normative commitments\nprovide an important check on our theories of personal identity. Nevertheless, the \nconsideration about moral responsibility is only one of many \nobjections both critics run against Locke. They also launch purely \nmetaphysical objections as well, the thought being that Locke's view \nfails both on its own terms and in light of its absurd normative \nimplications. So actually, while our normative commitments provide \nan important consideration that the theory of personal \nidentity should account for, it remains open that such commitments \ncould be overridden or revised, depending perhaps on the independent \nplausibility of the theory in question.\n\n\nFor some authors, however, the role of our normative commitments in \nthis debate is much stronger: they may actually authoritatively \nconstrain, shape, or even be immune or irrelevant to one's theory of \npersonal identity. This is a general methodological dispute about the\nproper direction of argumentation in the arena of personal identity \nand ethics. The assumption of many working in this arena has been \nevident in the discussion thus far: we work out or identify the \ncorrect theory of personal identity and then apply it where needed to\nthe world of ethics. What we will briefly explore in this section, \nthough, are four importantly different approaches (these are not \nexhaustive of the alternatives, however).\n\n\nFirst, there is the Kantian view, advanced by Christine Korsgaard, \nthat conceiving ourselves as practical agents simply \nrequires us to view our lives as unified, despite the \nweakness or strength of various psychological connections that may or\nmay not obtain between our various temporal stages. My conception of \nmyself as a unified agent is not based on any metaphysical theory; it\nis instead based (a) on the basic need I have to eliminate \nconflict among my various motivational desires in order to act \n(producing my unified agency at any given time, i.e., synchronic \nunity), (b) on my deliberative standpoint, within which I view \nmyself \u2013 a single deliberator/decider \u2013 as being\nover and above my various desires, weighing them and deciding between\nthem, and (c) on my need to pursue any ends or carry out a \nrational plan of life (presupposing my unified agency across time, \ni.e., diachronic unity). In any case, I must conceive myself as a \nunified agent both at a time and across time because I have only one \nbody with which to act. This unity, therefore, has no need of any \nmetaphysical support; instead, it is simply a practical requirement \nof being an agent, a doer of deeds and a thinker of thoughts \n(Korsgaard 1989).\n\n\nSecond, there is the communitarian view, advanced by philosophers \nlike Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor, that all proper \nconceptions of the self are dependent on social matrices. In order to\nunderstand the self, we must view it both in its relation to the good\nand in its relation to other selves, for two reasons. First, we have \nan indispensable ability both to have certain moral intuitions and to\narticulate the grounds of those intuitions, and this ability \npresupposes the existence of what Taylor calls evaluative frameworks,\nframeworks also presupposed by our concept of personhood. So crucial \nto understanding who I am is understanding where I stand in moral \nspace: my identity is bound up in, and at least partially constituted\nby, my strong attachments to a community that provides the evaluative\nframework within which I am able to articulate what is good and \nvaluable. Thus, to ask about a person abstracted from his \nself-interpretations is to ask \u201ca fundamentally misguided \nquestion\u201d (Taylor 1989, 34).\n\n\nThe second general reason selves can be understood only by reference \nto community and morality comes from a consideration of human \nactions. As MacIntyre notes, human actions are intelligible \nonly if viewed in a particular setting. We can understand a piece of \nhuman behavior only when we have situated the agent's intentions \nwithin the two contexts of their role in the agent's history and \ntheir role within the history of their particular setting(s). In \ndoing so, we are writing a narrative history. Intelligible actions \nare actions for which the agent is accountable, actions \nwhich have a place in an ongoing narrative (MacIntyre 1984, 206\u2013208).\nThus arises the notion of narrative unity. My life, my \nentire life, from physical birth to physical death, can be \nunderstood only as a narrative, as an ongoing story. Now the unity of\na narrative requires unity of character, and unity of character \npresupposes strict, numerical personal identity. To be the subject of\na narrative is to be accountable for past actions that have composed \nthat narrative life. To understand your actions now, therefore, I \nhave to understand them as actions situated in a life story, \nyour life story, as actions interrelated with your \nprior actions. As a result, \u201call attempts to elucidate the \nnotion of personal identity independently of and in isolation from \nthe notions of narrative, intelligibility and accountability are \nbound to fail. As all such attempts have\u201d (ibid., \n218).\n\n\nBoth the Kantian and communitarian objections target the  \ndisunifying implications of a metaphysical approach like \nreductionism, insisting instead that we are indeed unified as either \npractical agents or selves in moral space for purely normative \nreasons. Any theory of identity we construct, then, must be \nconstrained by these normative considerations, which are thus \nobviously prior. Nevertheless, we may have some reason to doubt these\nclaims. Consider first narrative unity. For one thing, it is not \nclear that intelligible actions are those for which the agent is \naccountable. Actions of children and the insane can be perfectly \nintelligible \u2013 even intelligible within some kind of narrative \nstructure \u2013 without being those for which the agents are \naccountable.\n\n\nMore troublesome, though, is the status of the narrative unity claim.\nIs it descriptive or prescriptive? If descriptive, asserting that \nselves simply conceive themselves as unified over their lives within \na narrative structure, then it seems false. As Galen Strawson points \nout, some people (and he claims to be one) are \n\u201cEpisodics,\u201d those who have \u201clittle or no sense \nthat the self that one is was there in the (further) past and will be\nthere in the future,\u201d and thus \u201care likely to have no \nparticular tendency to see their life in Narrative terms\u201d \n(Strawson 2004, 430). In addition, this observation bodes ill for the\nKantian, insofar as it asserts the possibility of practical agency \nfor those who do not view themselves as diachronically \nunified, i.e., unified practical agency may indeed not be a practical\nnecessity. On the other hand, if the narrative unity thesis is \nsupposed to be prescriptive, urging that people \nought to view themselves as unified over time within a\nnarrative structure, then it poses no threat to descriptive,\ndisuniting theories of identity like reductionism, for it would have\nto allow that life-long unity may simply not occur. Indeed, if the\naccount is prescriptive, then it actually makes more sense to consider\npersons to be disunified, if what they ought to strive for is greater\nunity.  If unity were a given, such striving would be\nunnecessary. (For somewhat similar considerations, see Williams\n2007.)\n\n\nBut even if we grant the need for the kind of unity desired by both \nthe Kantians and the communitarians, this does not yet imply that we \nmust grant the life-long unity on which they both insist. It\nmay be instead that only certain parts of one's life are \nunified in the way they describe, and these could in fact be \nstretches defined also by the obtaining of strong psychological \nconnectedness, say (such that one's life would be better conceived as\na collection of short stories than as a novel). In other words, it \ncould be that reductionist theories of personal identity dovetail \nwith these normative considerations already, so that rather than \nconstituting a constraint on that theory (and disuniting theories \nlike it), such considerations actually  buttress it.\n\n\nThe third methodological alternative insists that, because our \ncommonsense intuitions are at loggerheads over the thought \nexperiments motivating the various metaphysical theories of personal \nidentity (e.g., brain transplants, teletransportation, and the like),\nthe only plausible solution to this underlying conflict is going to \nbe revisionary, requiring us to abandon one of the conflicting sets \nof intuitions. But on the basis of what? Carol Rovane suggests that \nwe start instead by deploying something on which everyone could \nagree, namely, a conception of personhood that's allegedly built into\nthe foundations of every ethical position (including anti-theoretical\nones). Once we determine the key condition of personhood \u2013 the \ncondition Rovane calls \u201cthe ability to engage in  \nagency-regarding relations\u201d (Rovane 1998, 5) \u2013 we \ncan then go on to construct a metaphysical theory of personal \nidentity on top of this ethical concept. For Rovane, this will yield \nthe rather surprising possibility of both group persons, composed of \nmany human bodies (insofar as the group can meet the conditions of \nethical personhood, functioning as an individual agent), and multiple\npersons, simultaneously existing within only one human body (insofar \nas each \u201cpersonality\u201d can meet the condition of ethical \npersonhood, functioning as an individual agent, as well) \n(Ibid., chapters 4\u20135).\n\n\nOthers have been sufficiently moved as well by the recognition of \nconflicting intuitions in the puzzle cases to seek an entirely \ndifferent approach to the issue of personal identity (see, e.g., \nWilkes 1988, Schechtman 1996). But it is not yet clear why such a \nradical revision in methodology is called for. After all, the fact \nthat our intuitions conflict in the puzzle cases does not necessarily\nmean that there is some deep-seated, ineliminable incoherence in the \nconcepts we're applying to them. Instead, it may simply mean that \nthere are conditions restricting the deployment of our concepts to \nanything other than paradigm cases, or it might mean that we are \nactually unsure what our intuitions are about the puzzle \ncases (for the former objection, see Gendler 2002a, 231; for the \nlatter, see Degaynesford 2001, 171). (Further, even if we do agree on\nthe need for a distinctly ethical conception of personhood and \npersonal identity, it is not clear why the one Rovane has chosen is \nsupposed to be uniquely suited to our purposes. After all, \nthere will be plenty of other possible conceptions that are at least \nas plausible as having the agency-regarding ability, including \nconceptions emphasizing the ability to experience complex emotions, \nto control certain aspects of their world, or to feel pleasure and \npain [see Gendler 2002a, 236]. Why privilege agency-regarding \ncapacities over these?)\n\n\nA fourth alternative to the methodology assumed thus far is presented\nin a series of powerful papers by Mark Johnston, in which he defends \na view called \u201cminimalism,\u201d according to which the \nmetaphysical facts of personal identity are irrelevant to the \njustification of our person-related practices and practical concerns,\nthat the facts to which we think we are committed actually play only \na minimal role in those practices and concerns (Johnston 1987, 1989, \n1992, and 1997; Wolf 1986 and Unger 1990 have argued in a somewhat \nsimilar vein as well). Indeed, our practices here have a \njustification independent of metaphysics \u2013 a coherentist \njustification \u2013 so no metaphysical theory of personal identity \nwill imply any real revisions to them at all. Johnston illustrates \nthis point by talking about one of our practical concerns in \nparticular: self-concern. My self-concern is part of a wider pattern \nof self-referential concern, a special non-derivative concern \nI have for a certain limited network of people, all of whom bear certain \nsorts of special relations to me: I care about my friends, \nmy family, and my self. I care about them for their own\nsakes and I would need a very good reason not to do so (which is so \nfar not forthcoming) (Johnston 1997, 158\u2013159). Thus, in \u201cthe \nparticular case of personal identity, minimalism implies that any \nmetaphysical view of persons which we might have is either \nepiphenomenal or a redundant basis for our practice of making \njudgements about personal identity and organizing our practical \nconcerns around this relation\u201d (Johnston 1997, 150).\n\n\nThis is an important point. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether it\ncould be extended to apply to all of our practical concerns,\nresting as it does solely on an analysis of self-concern.  Indeed,\nthere may well be other person-related practices and concerns that\naren't part of that network of self-referential concerns, including,\nperhaps, moral responsibility, compensation, third-person\nreidentification, and general survival. For these other practices and\nconcerns, then, the metaphysics of identity may still be quite\nrelevant.  Indeed, trying to see what, if anything, serves to unify\nthe locus of all of these practical concerns is what motivates\nSchechtman's (2014) Anthropological View of our \u201cliteral\nidentity.\u201d Insofar as our many concerns are, she thinks,\norganized around one type of thing (what she calls a\n\u201cperson-life\u201d), we can derive from their close\nconsideration the actual identity conditions of individuals like us.\nHere, though, the issue is less about identity grounding our\npractical concerns than its being revealed by them.\n",
