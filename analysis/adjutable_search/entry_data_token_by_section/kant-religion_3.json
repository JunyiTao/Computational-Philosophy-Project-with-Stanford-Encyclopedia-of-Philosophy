    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period\n3. Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period\n\nWith the introduction of Transcendental Idealism\u2019s epistemic\nstrictures, Kant came to the conclusion that religion must fall\noutside the scope of theoretical reason. However, instead of atheism\nor agnosticism, Kant advanced a novel philosophical theology that\ngrounds religion on the \u201cneeds\u201d of practical reason. In\nthe B-Preface to the Critique of Pure Reason, he in fact\nintimates that his interest in religion is part of what motivated\nTranscendental Idealism. That is, as quoted earlier, Kant sought to\nestablish the limits to knowledge \u201cin order to make room for\nfaith\u201d (Bxxx). Such a faith has its source in the needs of pure\npractical reason (AK 8:137 [1785a], AK 5:142 [1788], AK 6:139 [1793]),\nand it is through these needs that Kant maintains that we can extend\nour cognition for practical purposes, allowing us to form a warranted\nconception of God and the afterlife in the service of the highest good\n(A814/B843\u2013A819/B847). Kant coins the term \u201cpure rational\nfaith\u201d (AK 8:142) in What does it mean to Orient oneself in\nThinking (1785a) and later uses this term as well as the\n\u201cpure philosophical doctrine of religion\u201d (AK 6:10\n[1793]), \u201cpure religion of reason\u201d (AK 6:12), \u201cpure\nrational system of religion\u201d (AK 6:12) and simply \u201cpure\nrationalism\u201d to refer to his positive philosophy of religion.\nNote, however, that Kant always intends by these terms specifically\npractical rather than theoretical reason, as the\n\u201cneeds\u201d which serve as the basis for faith pertain to our\npractical, moral lives.\n\nWe will here begin with a discussion of Kant\u2019s critique of the\ntraditional proofs for God\u2019s existence before moving on to the\npositive side of his philosophy of religion. Although the fame of this\ncritique has been taken as indicative of his philosophy of religion as\na whole, it is instead representative of his distinction in the\nCritical period between the illicit attempts at a positive philosophy\nof religion driven by theoretical reason, versus a philosophy of\nreligion that has its ground in practical philosophy.\n",
