Whitehead\u2019s Influence\n\nWhitehead\u2019s key philosophical concept\u2014the internal\nrelatedness of occasions of experience\u2014distanced him from the\nidols of logical positivism. Indeed, his reliance on our intuition of\nthe extensive relatedness of events (and hence, of the space-time\nmetric) was at variance with both Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nconventionalism and Einstein\u2019s interpretation of relativity: his\nreliance on our intuition of the causal relatedness of events, and of\nboth the efficient and the final aspects of causation, was an insult\nto the anti-metaphysical dogmas of Hume and Russell; his method of\ncausal explanation was also an antipode of Ernst Mach\u2019s method\nof economic description; his philosophical affinity with James and\nBergson as well as his endeavor to harmonize science and religion made\nhim liable to the Russellian charge of anti-intellectualism; and his\ngenuine modesty and aversion to public controversy made him invisible\nat the philosophical firmament dominated by the brilliance of Ludwig\nWittgenstein.\n\nAt first\u2014because of Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica collaboration with Russell as well as his application\nof mathematical logic to abstract the basic concepts of\nphysics\u2014logical positivists and analytic philosophers admired\nWhitehead. But when Whitehead published Science and the Modern\nWorld, the difference between Whitehead\u2019s thought and\ntheirs became obvious, and they grew progressively more dissatisfied\nover the direction in which Whitehead was moving. Susan Stebbing of\nthe Cambridge school of analysis is only one of many examples that\ncould be evoked here (cf. Chapman 2013: 43\u201349), and in order to\nfind a more positive reception of Whitehead\u2019s philosophical\nwork, one has to turn to opponents of analytic philosophy such as\nRobin George Collingwood (for example, Collingwood 1945). The\ndifferences with logical positivism and analytic philosophy, however,\nshould not lead philosophers to neglect the affinities of\nWhitehead\u2019s thought with these philosophical currents (cf.\nShields 2003, Desmet & Weber 2010, Desmet & Rusu 2012, Riffert\n2012).\n\nDespite signs of interest in Whitehead by a number of famous\nphilosophers\u2014for example, Hannah Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty\nand Gilles Deleuze\u2014it is fair to say that Whitehead\u2019s\nprocess philosophy would most likely have entered oblivion if the\nChicago Divinity School and the Claremont School of Theology had not\nshown a major interest in it. In other words, not philosophers but\ntheologians saved Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy from oblivion.\nFor example, Charles Hartshorne, who taught at the University of\nChicago from 1928 to 1955, where he was a dominant intellectual force\nin the Divinity School, has been instrumental in highlighting the\nimportance of Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy, which dovetailed\nwith his own, largely independently developed thought. Hartshorne\nwrote:\n\n\nThe century which produced some terrible things produced a scientist\nscarcely second in genius and character to any that ever lived,\nEinstein, and a philosopher who, I incline to say, is similarly second\nto none, unless it be Plato. To make no use of genius of this order is\nhardly wise; for it is indeed a rarity. A mathematician sensitive to\nso many of the values in our culture, so imaginative and inventive in\nhis thinking, so eager to learn from the great minds of the past and\nthe present, so free from any narrow partisanship, religious or\nirreligious, is one person in hundreds of millions. He can be\nmistaken, but even his mistakes may be more instructive than most\nother writers\u2019 truth. (2010: 30)\n\n\nAfter mentioning a number of other theologians next to Hartshorne as\npart of \u201cthe first wave of \u2026 impressive\nWhitehead-inspired scholars\u201d, Michel Weber\u2014in his\nIntroduction to the two-volume Handbook of Whiteheadian Process\nThought\u2014writes:\n\n\nIn the sixties emerged John B. Cobb, Jr. and Shubert M. Ogden.\nCobb\u2019s Christian Natural Theology remains a landmark in\nthe field. The journal Process Studies was created in 1971 by\nCobb and Lewis S. Ford; the Center for Process Studies was\nestablished in 1973 by Cobb and David Ray Griffin in Claremont. The\nresult of these developments was that Whiteheadian process scholarship\nhas acquired, and kept, a fair visibility \u2026 (Weber &\nDesmond 2008: 25)\n\n\nIndeed, inspired mainly by Cobb and Griffin, many other centers,\nsocieties, associations, projects and conferences of Whiteheadian\nprocess scholarship have seen the light of day all over the world. An\nimportant society is the European Society for Process\nThought with its annual summer schools and its book series,\nEuropean Studies in Process Thought (nine titles).\nAnother active society is the Deutsche Whitehead\nGesellschaft. Thirty six of today\u2019s most active\nprocess centers, however, are located in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. They were founded between 2002 and\n2018 by The Institute for Postmodern Development of\nChina, which also founded the Cobb\nEco-Academy in 2018, in Zhejiang. The Beijing\nWhitehead International Kindergarten is just\none example of Chinese involvement with Whitehead.\n\nOut of Belgium, Michel Weber has created in 2001 the\nWhitehead Psychology Nexus and the Chromatiques\nwhiteheadiennes scholarly societies, and he has been the driving\nforce behind several book series, including the\nseries published by Weber\u2019s own publishing company, Les\n\u00e9ditions Chromatika (forty four titles at\npresent), and the Process Thought Series published by\nOntos Verlag / De Gruyter (twenty seven\ntitles). The already mentioned Handbook of Whiteheadian\nProcess Thought is part of the latter book series. In\nit, 101 internationally renowned Whitehead scholars give an\nimpressive overview of the 2008 status of their research findings in\nan enormous variety of domains (cf. Armour 2010). Missing in the\nHandbook, however, are most Whitehead scholars reading\nWhitehead through Deleuzian glasses\u2014especially Isabelle\nStengers, whose 2011 book, Thinking with Whitehead, cannot be\nignored. The Lure of Whitehead, edited by Nicholas Gaskill\nand A. J. Nocek in 2014, can largely remedy that shortcoming.\nImportant for Whitehead scholarship, is the fact that the\nHandbook is in the process of being transformed into an\nonline Whitehead encyclopedia, which will contain additional entries,\nand of which the entries will be kept up to date. This is being\ndone by the Whitehead Research Project, that is, by the\npeople responsible for editing and publishing the book\nseries, Contemporary Whitehead Studies (fifteen\ntitles), and The Edinburgh Critical Edition of the\nComplete Works of Alfred North Whitehead, of which two volumes of\nThe Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead have already\nseen the light of day. The Whitehead Research Project website\nalso refers to a Whitehead Reading Group, contains\na Research Blog, and provides access to the Whitehead\nResearch Library, which holds a wealth of\nmostly unpublished materials, such as letters from and to\nWhitehead (cf. Whitehead Research Project\n [OIR]).\n\nThe oldest Whiteheadian book series is the SUNY Series\nin Constructive Postmodern Thought (thirty two titles), and\nthe two most recent series are published by the Process Century\nPress (cf. Process Century Press\n [OIR]).\n The most recent title in its Theological Exploration\nSeries (nine titles) is James & Whitehead on\nLife after Death by David Griffin (2022), and in the Series\nPreface of its successful Toward Ecological Civilization\nSeries (twenty two titles), John Cobb writes:\n\n\nWe live in the ending of an age. But the ending of the modern period\ndiffers from the ending of previous periods, such as the classical or\nthe medieval. The amazing achievements of modernity make it possible,\neven likely, that its end will also be the end of civilization, of\nmany species, or even of the human species. At the same time, we are\nliving in an age of new beginnings that give promise of an ecological\ncivilization. Its emergence is marked by a growing sense of urgency\nand deepening awareness that the changes must go to the roots of what\nhas led to the current threat of catastrophe.\n\nIn June 2015, the 10th Whitehead International Conference was held in\nClaremont, CA. Called \u201cSeizing an Alternative: Toward an\nEcological Civilization\u201d, it claimed an organic, relational,\nintegrated, nondual, and processive conceptuality is needed, and that\nAlfred North Whitehead provides this in a remarkably comprehensive and\nrigorous way. We proposed that he could be \u201cthe philosopher of\necological civilization\u201d. With the help of those who have come\nto an ecological vision in other ways, the conference explored this\nWhiteheadian alternative, showing how it can provide the shared vision\nso urgently needed.\n\n\nCobb refers to the tenth International Whitehead\nConference (IWC). The IWCs are sponsored by\nthe International Process Network. The IWC has\nbeen held at locations around the globe since 1981\u2014the 12th one\nwas in 2019, in Brasilia, Brazil, and the 13th one,\n\u201cWhitehead and the History of Philosophy,\u201d will be in July\n2023, in Munich, Germany. The IWC is an\nimportant venture in global Whiteheadian thought, as key Whiteheadian\nscholars from a variety of disciplines and countries come together for\nthe continued pursuit of critically engaging a process worldview.\nFinally, in 2019, the Cobb Institute\u2014A Community for\nProcess & Practice was formed, which has, among other\ninteresting initiatives, weekly John Cobb &\nFriends online gatherings to hear presentations from\nprominent scholars across the world. Recently, for\nexample, Jeremy Lent gave a presentation on his award\nwinning bestseller, The Web of Meaning\u2014Integrating science and\ntraditional wisdom to find our place in the universe (2021). The\nCobb & Friends Gatherings YouTube Channel contains a\nsample of recordings of these presentations, among which the Lent\npresentation.\n",
