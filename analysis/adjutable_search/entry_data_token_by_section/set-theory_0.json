    "main_text": "The origins\n1. The origins\n\nSet theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the work\nof Georg Cantor. One might say that set theory was born in late 1873,\nwhen he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum, that is,\nthe real line, is not countable, meaning that its points cannot be\ncounted using the natural numbers. So, even though the set of natural\nnumbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite, there are more\nreal numbers than there are natural numbers, which opened the door to\nthe investigation of the different sizes of infinity. See the entry on\nthe\n early development of set theory\n for a discussion of the origin of set-theoretic ideas and their use\nby different mathematicians and philosophers before and around\nCantor\u2019s time.\n\nAccording to Cantor, two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same size, or\ncardinality, if they are bijectable, i.e., the elements of\n\\(A\\) can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of\n\\(B\\). Thus, the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers and the set\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878\nCantor formulated the famous Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which\nasserts that every infinite set of real numbers is either countable,\ni.e., it has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), or has the same\ncardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). In other words, there are only two\npossible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. The CH is the most\nfamous problem of set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to\nit, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of\nthe twentieth century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first\nproblem in his celebrated list of 10 (later expanded to 23 in the\npublished version) unsolved mathematical problems presented in 1900 at\nthe Second International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. The\nattempts to prove the CH led to major discoveries in set theory, such\nas the theory of constructible sets, and the forcing technique, which\nshowed that the CH can neither be proved nor disproved from the usual\naxioms of set theory. To this day, the CH remains open.\n\nEarly on, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naive use\nof the notion of set; in particular, from the deceivingly natural\nassumption that every property determines a set, namely the set of\nobjects that have the property. One example is Russell\u2019s\nParadox, also known to Zermelo: \n\n\nconsider the property of sets of not being members of themselves. If\nthe property determines a set, call it \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is a member\nof itself if and only if \\(A\\) is not a member of itself.\n\n\nThus, some collections, like the collection of all sets, the\ncollection of all ordinals numbers, or the collection of all cardinal\nnumbers, are not sets. Such collections are called proper\nclasses.\n\nIn order to avoid the paradoxes and put it on a firm footing, set\ntheory had to be axiomatized. The first axiomatization was due to\nZermelo (1908) and it came as a result of the need to spell out the\nbasic set-theoretic principles underlying his proof of Cantor\u2019s\nWell-Ordering Principle. Zermelo\u2019s axiomatization avoids\nRussell\u2019s Paradox by means of the Separation axiom, which is\nformulated as quantifying over properties of sets, and thus it is a\nsecond-order statement. Further work by Skolem and Fraenkel led to the\nformalization of the Separation axiom in terms of formulas of\nfirst-order, instead of the informal notion of property, as well as to\nthe introduction of the axiom of Replacement, which is also formulated\nas an axiom schema for first-order formulas (see next section). The\naxiom of Replacement is needed for a proper development of the theory\nof transfinite ordinals and cardinals, using transfinite recursion\n(see\n Section 3).\n It is also needed to prove the existence of such simple sets as the\nset of hereditarily finite sets, i.e., those finite sets whose\nelements are finite, the elements of which are also finite, and so on;\nor to prove basic set-theoretic facts such as that every set is\ncontained in a transitive set, i.e., a set that contains all elements\nof its elements (see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of Zermelo set\ntheory). A further addition, by von Neumann, of the axiom of\nFoundation, led to the standard axiom system of set theory, known as\nthe Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC.\n\nOther axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von\nNeumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), allow also for\na formal treatment of proper classes.\n",
