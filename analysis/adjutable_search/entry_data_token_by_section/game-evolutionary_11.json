    "main_text": "Philosophical Problems of Evolutionary Game Theory || The explanatory irrelevance of evolutionary game theory\n6.2 The explanatory irrelevance of evolutionary game theory\n\nAnother question facing evolutionary game theoretic explanations of\nsocial phenomena concerns the kind of explanation it seeks to give.\nDepending on the type of explanation it seeks to provide, are\nevolutionary game theoretic explanations of social phenomena\nirrelevant or mere vehicles for the promulgation of pre-existing\nvalues and biases? To understand this question, recognize that one\nmust ask whether evolutionary game theoretic explanations target the\netiology of the phenomenon in question, the persistence of the\nphenomenon, or various aspects of the normativity attached to the\nphenomenon. The latter two questions seem deeply connected, for\npopulation members typically enforce social behaviors and rules having\nnormative force by sanctions placed on those failing to comply with\nthe relevant norm; and the presence of sanctions, if suitably strong,\nexplains the persistence of the norm. The question regarding a\nphenomenon\u2019s etiology, on the other hand, can be considered\nindependent of the latter questions.\n\nIf one wishes to explain how some currently existing social phenomenon\ncame to be, it is unclear why approaching it from the point of view of\nevolutionary game theory would be particularily illuminating. The\netiology of any phenomenon is a unique historical event and, as such,\ncan only be discovered empirically, relying on the work of\nsociologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and the like. Although\nan evolutionary game theoretic model may exclude certain historical\nsequences as possible histories (since one may be able to show that\nthe cultural evolutionary dynamics preclude one sequence from\ngenerating the phenomenon in question), it seems unlikely that an\nevolutionary game theoretic model would indicate a unique historical\nsequence suffices to bring about the phenomenon. An empirical inquiry\nwould then still need to be conducted to rule out the extraneous\nhistorical sequences admitted by the model, which raises the question\nof what, if anything, was gained by the construction of an\nevolutionary game theoretic model in the intermediate stage. Moreover,\neven if an evolutionary game theoretic model indicated that a single\nhistorical sequence was capable of producing a given social\nphenomenon, there remains the important question of why we ought to\ntake this result seriously. One may point out that since nearly any\nresult can be produced by a model by suitable adjusting of the\ndynamics and initial conditions, all that the evolutionary game\ntheorist has done is provide one such model. Additional work needs to\nbe done to show that the underlying assumptions of the model (both the\ncultural evolutionary dynamics and the initial conditions) are\nempirically supported. Again, one may wonder what has been gained by\nthe evolutionary model\u2014would it not have been just as easy to\ndetermine the cultural dynamics and initial conditions beforehand,\nconstructing the model afterwards? If so, it would seem that the\ncontributions made by evolutionary game theory in this context simply\nare a proper part of the parent social science\u2014sociology,\nanthropology, economics, and so on. If so, then there is nothing\nparticular about evolutionary game theory employed in the\nexplanation, and this means that, contrary to appearances,\nevolutionary game theory is really irrelevant to the given\nexplanation.\n\nIf evolutionary game theoretic models do not explain the etiology of a\nsocial phenomenon, presumably they explain the persistence of the\nphenomenon or the normativity attached to it. Yet we rarely need an\nevolutionary game theoretic model to identify a particular social\nphenomenon as stable or persistent as that can be done by observation\nof present conditions and examination of the historical records; hence\nthe charge of irrelevancy is raised again. Moreover, most of the\nevolutionary game theoretic models developed to date have provided the\ncrudest approximations of the real cultural dynamics driving the\nsocial phenomenon in question. One may well wonder why, in these\ncases, we should take seriously the stability analysis given by the\nmodel; answering this question would require one engage in an\nempirical study as previously discussed, ultimately leading to the\ncharge of irrelevance again.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that evolutionary game theoretic models answer\n\u201chow possibly\u201d questions. That is, an evolutionary game\ntheoretic model shows how some phenomenon could possibly be generated\nby an underlying dynamical process of interacting, boundedly rational\nagents. Although this is certainly the case, one might wonder whether\nthis subtly shifts the explanatory target. Answering a \u201chow\npossibly\u201d question is most interesting when we do not know\nwhether something is possible at all. The challenge faced by some\nevolutionary game theoretic accounts of social phenomena is that they\nanswer a \u201chow possibly\u201d question regarding something which\nwe already knew was possible, because the phenomenon actually exists.\nWhat we would like to know is how the answer to the \u201chow\npossibly\u201d question connects to the actual real-world processes\ngenerating the phenomenon. This suggests that evolutionary game\ntheoretic explanations of social phenomena are, even in the best\ncases, incomplete. \n",
