    "main_text": "Embodiment\n5. Embodiment\n\n\nFeminist scholars have explored how corporeal or biological\ndistinctiveness mediates daily activities so that self-identification\nand social experience act on, and become attuned to, each other.\nFeminist research such as that of Susan Sherwin (1992) shows that\nmedicine has treated women as if they were disabled people, intervening\nin their bodies to eliminate or discipline (to use Foucault's term)\nthose parts that mark their identification with a purportedly inferior\ngroup. Medicine has, in particular, been dismissive of women's\nemotional lives. The history of how medicine has addressed disabled\npeople is similar. It is a history of the repression and\nrejection of bodies and minds that diverge from the supposed paradigm\nor norm provided by healthy young males.\n\n\nEnlightened by these parallels with their own history, some early\ndisability studies scholars rejected medical practices directed at\naltering themselves. They characterized the medical model of\ndisability, which takes disability to be a problem requiring medical\nrather than social intervention and as both the prerogative and the\nresponsibility of medical professionals to fix, as oppressive. They saw\nmedicine itself as a coercive instrument that subordinates disabled\npeople, not the least by inducing feelings of inadequacy and self-hate\nin them. (See UPIAS 1978; Finkelstein 1980; Oliver 1983.)\n\n\nJust as biological sex, and the division of humans into two sexes,\ninitially were taken as givens in feminist theory, so early disability\nstudies scholars proposed to treat impairments such as being unable to\nhear, see, walk, talk, or execute cognitive activities as biological\ngivens, and disabilities as social interpretations of\nimpairments. On such accounts, the properties of bodies\n(including brains) are supposed to be pre-social. According to\nthese accounts, it is socially constructed interpretations and\nvaluations of the powers of neutral corporeal properties that consign\npeople with various kinds of bodies to advantageous or detrimental\nsocial roles.\n\n\nJenny Morris, a leader of the disabled women's movement,\nproposes that the social model of disability enables disabled people to\ndefine their own bodies and their differences in terms of personal\nexperience and self-authorization, free of detached diagnoses imposed\nby medical authorities. The social model construes the limitations of\npeople with disabilities as a social problem rooted in the imposition\nof practices that are biased against the disabled. Once\nunderstood as products of bias rather than biology, disabled\npeople's disadvantages can be remedied through the pursuit of\njustice to reform the practices that oppress them. According to Morris,\nadopting the social model of disability makes it possible to talk about\naddressing the limitations of disabled people's functioning\nwithout condemning, or requiring improvements in, the state of their\nbodies (or, for that matter, their minds) (Morris 2001).\n\n\nBetter informed, more sophisticated recognition of and reflection on\nthe facts about sex and gender have complicated the picture for both\nfeminist and disability scholarship. There are, for example, intersexed\npeople, born with the biological markers of both female and male.\nA socially imposed allegiance to sexual dualism demands they be\nsubmitted to medical intervention that (usually through amputation)\npresses their bodies into one or the other sexual mold. Yet\nhaving a woman's body does not necessarily suit a person for feminine\nroles, nor do all those with men's bodies find themselves fitting\ncomfortably into masculine roles. The materiality of\nsexual characteristics does not make them unbreachable constants. There\nare individuals who adapt with facility to gendered roles that are not\ntraditional for their particular bodily configurations.\n\n\nOthers, however, find their sexual characteristics too\nrestricting for the roles they adopt and consequently seek to change\nthese elements of their bodies through surgical and chemical\nintervention. The way transgendered people see themselves in the world\nindicates that the body's limitations cannot always be\ndiscounted. While some people do not think their corporeal\nalteration is required to comfortably fit into opposite gendered roles,\nothers seek medical intervention to facilitate their transgendering.\nThus, the experiences of transgendered people suggest that there are\ncircumstances in which altering one's body to better execute preferred\nsocial roles can be an affirming, rather than a degrading,\nchoice.\n\n\nThese considerations show not only the error in supposing that the\nnatural and social dimensions of embodiment can be cleanly\ndichotomized, but also the superficiality of thinking that we always\nshould take bodies as they come. Extrapolating this insight to\ndisability helps us to see the over-simplification in condemning\nmedical transformations of the body as being expressions of\nself-hatred. There is no phenomenological firewall separating our\nawareness of our biological properties from our social experiences. How\nour own bodies feel to us is shaped by social discourse.\n\n\nIn a documentary film presenting conversations with leading philosophers, \nfeminist theorist Judith Butler learns about the social model of disability\nfrom artist and disability activist Sunaura Taylor (Taylor, 2009). The social\nmodel is compatible with Butler's own theory of embodiment. Butler observes \nthat everyone, whether or not disabled, requires support for bodily\nactivities from various kinds of things that are external to their bodies.\nEvery body is permeable in the sense of being vulnerable to being impinged\nupon by others. People who violently target and victimize the disabled are \nmanaging their own permeability by abusing individuals who appear to be\nmore dependent than most and thus more vulnerable. Violent acts against the\ndisabled foreground their permeability and thereby, according to Butler, give  \nthe perpetrators the illusion of being themselves exempt from permeability.\n\n\nApplying Butler's ideas about embodiment, which emphasize the\ninconstancy of conceptualizations of bodily kinds, feminist legal\nscholar Kathryn Abrams contends that one reason the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA) has had trouble in the courts, with most\nplaintiffs losing their cases (at least under Title I - Employment),\nis because the social model disrupts a premise of mainstream\njurisprudence. The legal norm presumes that human bodies are\nbiological objects of fixed kinds, whereas on Butler's theory bodies\nare contingently constituted by transient social interactions (Abrams\n2011:76).  However, not all judicial thinking has been so narrow. For\nexample, in 2006 a pre-surgery transexual individual's denial of\nemployment suit was allowed to proceed, despite the defendant's claim\nthat Title VII did not apply because the plaintiff was not a woman; in\nsupporting the plaintiff, the court invoked the factual complexities\nthat underlie human sexual identity and explained that these\ncomplexities are occasioned by how biological sexuality interacts with\nsocial, physiological, and legal conceptions of gender\n(see Schroer v. Billington 2006, 2009).\n\n\nOur bodies' responses and responsiveness inflect in turn the social as\nwell as the solitary aspects of our experiences. Nor is social practice\nisolated from, or prior to, materiality. An individual's\nimpairments are no more neutral than her sexual characteristics are,\nfor they mediate much of the content of her consciousness of the world\nwith which she interacts. Performing major life functions such as\nmobilizing, hearing, seeing, communicating and understanding are such\nintimate elements of the fabric of our experience that what we view as\nwithin our reach in the world around us\u2014and thereby what we take as\nthe objects of our ambition\u2014arises out of the scope and facility of\nour biological functioning.\n\n\nConsidering whether the experiences of women are sufficiently\nacknowledged in disability studies, Susan Wendell points to masculinist\ninfluences on the field's standard model of disability (1996).\nWendell offers a refreshing look at the disability politics of\npromoting an image of the healthy disabled, which is similar to the\nfeminist politics of excluding disabled women altogether in an effort\nto advance more appealing and powerful icons. She argues that the\nsocial model of disability, which until recently has been the\npreeminent theoretical inspiration for disability studies, tends to\nobscure the frequency with which disability is tied to illness (Wendell\n2001).\n\n\nOpponents of the medical model of disability urged the\ndisentanglement of disability from illness, pointing out that many\nindividuals with disabilities are as strong and capable of productivity\nas nondisabled people, and therefore should not be consigned to\nthe limitations of the \u201csick\u201d role (Amundson 1992). This strategy\nalso promotes self-reliance over dependence and replaces trust in the\nexpertise of medical and social service professionals with strategies\nto let disabled people take control of their own lives. The useful\npoint of such emphasis for disabled individuals, Wendell acknowledges,\nis that by getting their political position about subordination to\nmedicalization right, they affirm rather than devalue their own\nbodies.\n\n\nYet, Wendell adds, political correctness will not always make people\nfeel right about our bodies or make their bodies feel right.\nIllness is itself disabling, and chronically ill individuals constitute\na prominent part of the population considered to be disabled. Making\nhealthy rather than ill disabled people paradigmatic of the disability\ncategory may obscure some disabled people's important differences.\nWorse, doing so may perpetuate our culture's devaluing of dependency\nand inflating of the value of self-sufficiency. Wendell argues\nfor reforming disability studies through a more inclusive feminist\napproach to disablement, namely, one that does not exaggerate the value\nof strength and independence as she believes masculinist influenced\ntheorizing tends to do (Wendell 1996).\n\n\n\nWendell also proposes that feminist disability politics consider the\nimplications of chronic illnesses that mark the unhealthy disabled's\nexperience of embodiment (Wendell 2001). One such implication concerns\nthe appropriate reaction to suffering. Many chronically ill people feel\npain, fatigue, feebleness, and disorientation to a degree that\nforestalls productivity, saps self-sufficiency, and even may alienate\nthem from their own bodies or minds. The social response in both\nmainstream society and disability circles is to support cures for\nchronic illnesses, as though the suffering caused by illnesses renders\nthese conditions irrelevant to how disabled individuals form their\nidentities. Yet some disabled individuals, at least, reject medical\ninterventions aimed at a cure on the ground that they do not wish to\nbecome different from whom they are. To the contrary, Wendell\nthinks, an adequate philosophical account of embodiment will appreciate\nidentities inflected by suffering without glorifying or sugar-coating\nthe debilitating dimensions of perpetual exhaustion and discomfort.\n\n\nA related implication concerns the reaction to emotional or\npsychiatric suffering. Unlike feminist literary scholarship,\nwhere studies of madness are well represented, feminist philosophers\nhave shown comparatively little interest in addressing the phenomena of\nneurodiversity. Feminist and disability studies theorists who are\nundermining the domination of paradigms of youth and health should\nextend their efforts so as to liberate psychiatrically disabled people\nfrom the idealization of the neurotypical mind. Andrea Nicki argues\nthat feminists ordinarily do not think of anger and aggression as being\nvaluable because they are emotions of competition rather than\ncooperation. But, Nicki thinks, these feelings may serve as\nmorally valuable\u2014because liberating\u2014expressions for some\nneurodiverse people, especially for emotionally abused individuals\n(2001).\n",
