People have a robust set of\nintuitions about what is and what is not a reason for a given agent to\nperform a given action. All nontrivial versions of reasons internalism\nand externalism have substantive implications concerning the extension\nof agents\u2019 reasons, and for the most part theory here is answerable to\ncommon sense and aims at accommodating it. Some of the most\nsignificant and compelling arguments for and against versions of\ninternalism are therefore extensional, that is to say, based on what\nreasons agents actually have. An internalist account\u2019s predictions\nabout what is and what is not a reason for a particular agent can be\ntested against our prior judgments about what reasons there are.\n",
