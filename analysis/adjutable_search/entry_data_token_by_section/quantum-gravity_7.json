    "main_text": "Methodology || Theory\n4.1 Theory\n\nAs remarked in the introduction, there is no single, generally\nagreed-upon body of theory in quantum gravity. The majority of the\nphysicists working in the field focus their attention on string\ntheory, an ambitious program which aims at providing a unified theory\nof all four interactions. A non-negligible minority work on what is\nnow called loop quantum gravity, the goal of which is simply to\nprovide a quantum theory of the gravitational interaction\nsimpliciter. There is also significant work in other areas,\nincluding approaches that don\u2019t really involve the quantization\nof a theory at all. [Good recent reviews of the theoretical landscape\ninclude Carlip 2001, Smolin 2001 (Other Internet Resources section\nbelow), 2003, Penrose 2004, and Oriti, ed, 2009.] But there is no real\nconsensus, for at least two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that it is extremely difficult to make any\nconcrete predictions in these theories. String theory, in particular,\nis plagued by a lack of experimentally testable predictions because of\nthe tremendous number of distinct ground or vacuum states in the\ntheory, with an absence of guiding principles for singling out the\nphysically significant ones (including our own). Though the string\ncommunity prides itself on the dearth of free parameters in the theory\n(in contrast to the nineteen or so free parameters found in the\nstandard model of particle physics), the problem arguably resurfaces\nin the huge number of vacua associated with different\ncompactifications of the nine space dimensions to the three we\nobserve. These vacua are either viewed as distinct string theories, or\nelse as solutions of one and the same theory (though some deeper,\nunknown theory, as mentioned above). Attempts to explain why we live\nin the particular vacuum that we do have recently given rise to\nappeals to the infamous anthropic principle (Susskind, 2003), whereby\nthe existence of humans (or observers) is invoked to, in some sense,\n\u201cexplain\u201d the fact that we find ourselves in a particular\nworld by restricting the possible ground states to those that could\nsupport such creatures in which we should expect our universe\u2019s\nobserved features to be typical. (See Weinstein, 2006, for a\nphilosophical discussion of the usage of anthropic reasoning in string\ntheory, including an ambiguity in the meaning of\n\u2018typicality\u2019 in this context; Azhar, 2013, further\ndevelops this discussion.)\n\nLoop quantum gravity is seemingly less plagued by a lack of\npredictions, and indeed it is often claimed that the discreteness of\narea and volume operators are concrete predictions of the theory, with\npotentially testable consequences. Proponents of this approach argue\nthat this makes the theory more susceptible to falsification, and thus\nmore scientific (in the sense of Popper; see the entry on\n Karl Popper)\n than string theory (see Smolin 2006 for this line of argument).\nHowever, it is still quite unclear, in practice and even in principle,\nhow one might actually observe these quantities. There have been\nrecent suggestions that in order to probe the effects of the Planck\nscale (discreteness, or minimal length in particular) one needs to\nlook to the cosmological level for tiny violations of Lorentz\ninvariance. Rovelli and Speziale (2003) have argued that, in fact, the\nexistence of a minimal length does not imply a violation of the\nLorentz symmetry (a conclusion seconded by the proponents of the\ncausal set programme). Their argument turns on the fact that in the\ncontext of quantum theory, symmetries act on states (and so on mean\nvalues) rather than eigenvalues (representing the discrete quantities\nin the theory). However, in any case, there remains a question mark\nover the theoretical status of the discreteness result which has been\nshown to hold only for operators on the kinematical Hilbert\nspace, that is, for gauge-variant quantities. It is still an open\nquestion whether this result transfers to genuine observables (i.e.\noperators that satisfy all of the constraints and are defined on the\nphysical Hilbert space: that gauge-invariant quantities). See\nDittrich and Thiemann (2009) for a detailed investigation of the\nproblem and a possible resolution employing suitably gauge-fixed (by\nmatter) Dirac observables. Even if one overcomes this problem, and\ncould observe evidence of the discreteness of space, so many\napproaches involve such discreteness that one would face a further\nproblem in using this new data to decide between the discrete\napproaches. For a philosophical discussion of this and related issues\n(including the question of whether the proposed discreteness breaks\nLorentz invariance), see Hagar (2009) \u2014 Hagar (2014) considers\nthese and related issues in a book-length treatment.\n",
