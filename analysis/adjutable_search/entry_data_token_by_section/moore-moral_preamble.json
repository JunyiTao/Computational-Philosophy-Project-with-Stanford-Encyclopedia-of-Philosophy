    "main_text": "\n\nG.E. Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica of 1903 is often\nconsidered a revolutionary work that set a new agenda for\n20th-century ethics. This historical view is, however,\nsomewhat overstated. In metaethics Moore\u2019s non-naturalist\nrealism was close to that defended by Henry Sidgwick and other late\n19th-century philosophers such as Hastings Rashdall, Franz\nBrentano, and J.M.E. McTaggart; in normative ethics his ideal\nconsequentialism likewise echoed views of Rashdall, Brentano, and\nMcTaggart. But Principia Ethica presented its views with\nunusual force and vigor. In particular, it made much more of the\nalleged errors of metaethical naturalism than Sidgwick or Rashdall\nhad, saying they vitiated most previous moral philosophy. For this\nreason, Moore\u2019s work had a disproportionate influence on\n20th-century moral philosophy and remains the best-known\nexpression of a general metaethical view also shared by later writers\nsuch as H.A. Prichard, W.D. Ross, and C.D. Broad.\n",
