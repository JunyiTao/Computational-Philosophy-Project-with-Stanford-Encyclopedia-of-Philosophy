    "preamble": "\n\nIn contemporary legal and political thought, the term \u2018civil\nrights\u2019 is indissolubly linked to the organized, mass liberation\nstruggle of American blacks during the mid-20th century. The Civil\nRights Movement sought the abolition of the Jim Crow system of racial\noppression and exploitation and aimed to make free and equal\ncitizenship a reality for blacks. The idea of civil rights central to\nthe movement referred to the rights belonging, as a matter of justice,\nto free and equal citizens. It was an idea that had found expression\nin those amendments to the U.S. Constitution adopted in the era of\nReconstruction that followed the defeat of the Confederacy in the\nCivil War. \n\nThe Civil Rights Movement sought to redeem the broken promise of free\nand equal citizenship embodied in the Reconstruction amendments.\nSignificant steps had been taken toward fulfilling that promise during\nthe decade that followed the end of the war. However, violent white\nresistance across the former Confederacy and a fading commitment to\nthe promise among Northern whites led to the demise of Reconstruction\nand the rapid consolidation of a new form of racial subjugation. As\nW.E.B. Du Bois poetically put the matter: \u201cThe slave went free; stood\na brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery\u201d\n(1935/1992: 30).\n\nDuring the course of the Civil Rights Movement, a relatively narrow\nidea of civil rights began to dominate public discourse and became the\nstandard idea of what such rights encompassed. The term \u2019civil\nrights\u2019 came to refer, not to the full set of claims\nconstitutive of free and equal citizenship, but to rights against\ndiscrimination, initially denoting discrimination based on race and\nethnicity but soon expanding to include sex, disability, sexual\npreference and other salient categories of social and personal\nidentity. The older and broader idea of civil rights as the full set\nof claims belonging to free and equal citizens was eclipsed, as the\nkinds of issues commonly characterized as involving civil rights\nbecame exclusively concerned with matters of discrimination.\n\nNonetheless, despite the differences in linguistic usage to which the\ntwo ideas of civil rights give rise, there is no substantive\nincompatibility between them. In fact, the older idea subsumes the\nmore recent, on any morally plausible view: it cannot be reasonably\ndenied that the rights constitutive of free and equal citizenship\nencompass, and go beyond, rights against discrimination. But because\ndiscrimination remains a persistent and widely-discussed source of\nsystemic injustice, the standard idea identifying civil rights with\nrights against discrimination is unlikely to fade in the foreseeable\nfuture. Yet, the older idea of civil rights is by no means\nsuperannuated: it remains indispensable to legal and political\ndiscourse, functioning often as part of the implicit normative\nbackground and sometimes as an explicitly articulated subject of the\ndiscourse. This entry will follow the older idea, treating all of the\nrights of free and equal citizens as civil rights; at the same time,\nthe entry gives special attention to current controversies in which\nrights against discrimination are at issue.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Free and Equal Citizenship\n\nFree and equal citizens in a modern society enjoy rights to both\npublic and private autonomy. Each citizen must have rights securing\ntheir freedom to participate in the formation of public opinion and in\nsociety\u2019s collective decisions (public autonomy), as well as\nrights guaranteeing their freedom to decide what way of individual\nlife to pursue (private autonomy) (Habermas 1996). The importance of\nthese two dimensions of modern citizenship derives from what Rawls\ncalls \u201cthe two moral powers\u201d of personhood: the capacity\nto have and act from a sense of justice and the capacity to hold,\nrevise, and act from a conception of the good (1995: 164; 2001: 18).\nPersons stand as free and equal citizens when their society and its\npolitical system accord equal and due weight to the interest each one\nhas in the development and exercise of their own moral powers.\n\nThe idea of free and equal citizenship emerged over the course of\nseveral centuries in Western societies that would become modern\nrepresentative democracies. The idea can be traced back to 17th\ncentury English egalitarians and liberals, such as Lilburne (1649) and\nLocke (1690/1952), and it received dramatic expression during the\nFrench Revolution with its \u201cDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of\nthe Citizen\u201d (1789) and the overthrow of the entrenched hierarchies\nand absolutist rule of the ancien r\u00e9gime. But until well into\nthe 20th century, racist and sexist assumptions about which human\nbeings had the capacity to be fully contributing members of society\nled to an unduly constricted view of who could legitimately claim the\nrights of a free and equal citizen. Those assumptions have been\nlargely eliminated from philosophical discourse, although they persist\nin some segments of society.\n2. The Standard Idea\n\nIn contemporary public discourse, the term \u2019civil rights\u2019\nis typically used to refer to a range of rights narrower than the full\nset of claims belonging to free and equal citizens. This usage\nreflects the now standard idea of civil rights as the rights that\nmembers of society have against discrimination on the basis of race,\nsex, ethnicity, disability, sexual preference, and other\ncharacteristics regarded as morally objectionable reasons for the\ndistribution of major social benefits and burdens. Discrimination, in\nturn, is understood as encompassing those actions, policies and\npractices that (wrongfully) disadvantage the members of certain\nsocially salient groups, on account of their group identity, relative\nto other members of society (cf. Lippert- Rasmussen 2014). \n\nChristopher Schmidt argues that the standard idea is a 20th century\ndevelopment, deviating from the concept of civil rights that prevailed\nin the decades following the Civil War. He notes that the earlier\nconcept referred to \u201cthe right to contract, own property, sue, testify\nin court, and the right to physical security,\u201d all of which were\nregarded as \u201cfundamental to citizenship\u201d (2021: 30 and 52). But\n\u201c[w]hen civil rights was [sic] reborn in the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century,\u201d a \u201cnovel\u201d concept emerged that \u201ccentered on a\nsweeping nondiscrimination principle rather than on a bounded\ncollection of fundamental rights\u201d (135).\n\nRobin West paints a similar historical picture, though her focus is on\nlegal doctrine rather than on the general public understanding. She\nwrites, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a civil right to much of anything, beyond\nthe right to nondiscrimination \u2026 under our contemporary\nconception of civil rights\u201d (2019: 74). West explains how the U.S.\nSupreme Court has been instrumental in the current dominance of this\nidea of civil rights, but she also points to the role that mainstream\nlegal scholarship has played. By contrast with this current idea,\naccording to the \u201cclassical understanding\u201d (29) held by 19th century\njurists, civil rights \u201cwere not simply rights \u2019not to be\ndiscriminated against\u2019 on the basis of impermissible\ncharacteristics,\u201d but also included \u201cunambiguously rights to\nsomething: . . . to protection and security, to enter and enforce\ncontracts, to own buy or sell property\u201d and other categorical claims\nessential to \u201cmembership in society\u201d (149\u201350 and 157, emphasis in\noriginal). As a progressive liberal who seeks to have legal doctrine\nrecognize substantive economic claims as rights of citizenship, West\naims to transcend the standard idea by subordinating it to an updated\nversion of the classical understanding.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, many radical activists calling for revolutionary\nchange have ignored any idea of civil rights broader than the standard\none. Accordingly, Angela Davis, who is among the most prominent of\nthose activists, explains that \u201cthe frame of civil rights\u201d\nis too small to understand the nature of the black freedom struggle in\nAmerica and beyond. The struggle \u201cwas not only a question of\nacquiring the formal rights to fully participate in society, but\nrather it was also about substantive rights \u2013 it was about jobs,\nfree education, free health care, affordable housing, and also about\nending the racist police occupation of Black communities\u201d (2016:\n72). So Davis follows the legal mainstream in declining to describe as\n\u201ccivil rights\u201d categorical claims to such goods as jobs, housing,\nhealth care and trustworthy policing. \n\nWest argues that the standard idea is inextricably connected to a\nconceptual error. Consider the right to protection from private\nviolence, which West characterizes as \u201cthe irreducible,\nminimal, and even quintessential civil right\u201d (2019: 66; emphasis in\noriginal). Each member of society has such a right, she contends, and,\nif the government fails to secure it for everyone, then the civil\nrights of all are violated, notwithstanding the fact that there would\nbe no discrimination involved in the failure (23). Accordingly, she\nholds that it is a conceptual mistake to \u201cconflate[ ] the idea of\nnondiscrimination with the idea of civil rights\u201d (18).\n\nAdditionally, West argues that the standard idea is tied to normative\nerrors, because it fails to affirm that members of society not only\nhave a right against being deprived of certain benefits for\ndiscriminatory reasons; they also have a categorical right to those\nbenefits. The result is that, given the standard idea, civil rights\nare rendered \u201chollow\u201d and \u201cformal,\u201d lacking\nsubstantive content because they do not mandate outcomes in the\ndistribution of benefits but only require that processes of\ndistribution be free of discrimination (46 and 48).\n\nFor West, the normative deficiency of the standard idea is on display\nin the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings regarding education and\nemployment. The court has ruled that there are constitutional rights\nagainst being denied an educational or employment opportunity on\ngrounds of race or sex but has failed to recognize any categorical\nconstitutional right to education or employment (204\u2013212). The court\nhas even failed to recognize a categorical civil right to police\nprotection. West regards those failures as reflections of the standard\nidea and its radically truncated conception of \u201cthe duty the state\ntakes on, when we enter a social compact\u201d (66).\n\nHowever, the standard idea is not conceptually or normatively\ndeficient in the ways that West claims it to be. The idea is\nconsistently conjoined with the recognition that, beyond\nantidiscrimination rights, free and equal citizenship requires rights\nto police protection, education, and other benefits that modern\nsociety can and should provide its members. If the Supreme Court is\nwrong in failing to recognize such claims as among the basic rights of\ncitizens, then the problem is not with the standard idea but rather\nwith the court\u2019s impoverished understanding of free and equal\ncitizenship. \n\nAdditionally, West\u2019s charge that the standard idea renders civil\nrights \u201chollow\u201d due to the merely \u201cformal\u201d character of\nantidiscrimination rights appears to unduly minimize the normative\nsignificance of claims against discrimination. Even though such claims\nare, in a sense, \u201cformal,\u201d claims that are formal can still be morally\nimportant. Davis acknowledges this point, writing that civil rights\nare \u201cimmensely important,\u201d even though she adds that \u201cfreedom is more\nexpansive than civil rights\u201d (2016: 72). \n\nThe normative significance of formal rights can be appreciated by\nconsidering the right to vote in a free and fair election. There is no\nguaranteed or predetermined outcome in such an election, and, to that\nextent, the right to vote is formal: it is a right to be part of a\nprocess, not a right to any particular outcome of the process. But the\nfranchise is not normatively \u201chollow\u201d; rather, it is a right that has\nhelped persons in a modern society to protect themselves from serious\ninjustice (sec. 4 below).\n3. Categories of Rights\n\nCivil rights have often been understood by way of contrast with claims\nsaid to belong to different categories of rights: political, social,\nwelfare and cultural, among others. Competing conceptions of civil\nrights have drawn the contrasts in different ways and for different\npurposes. To the extent that a particular contrast is used to express\na view that unduly limits the scope of claims belonging to free and\nequal citizenship, the contrast is subject to critique and revision on\nthe basis of a suitably capacious idea of civil rights. Such critique\nand revision were what led to the abandonment of the once widespread\nview that political rights are not civil rights. And, in the judgment\nof many, though not all, contemporary thinkers, welfare and cultural\nrights, like political rights, are essential to the freedom and\nequality of citizens and so ought to be counted as types of civil\nrights rather than as rights of an altogether different kind.\n3.1 Political and Social Rights\n\nUntil well into the 20th century, civil rights were sharply contrasted\nwith political and social rights. Civil rights encompassed the rights\nto own property, enter into legally binding contracts, receive due\nprocess of law, bring private lawsuits, testify in court, and worship\none\u2019s religion. They also covered freedom of speech and the\npress (Amar 1998: 216\u201317). But they were traditionally conceived\nas excluding the right to vote or to hold public office, which were\nassigned to an entirely separate category, that of political rights,\nand conferred by law only on (some) adult males. Social rights\nconcerned the domain of interactions deemed \u201cprivate,\u201d which\nencompassed not only personal relationships such as friendships but\ntransactions between businesses and their clientele.\n\nThe separation of civil from political and social rights was\ntraditionally invoked to limit the scope of citizenship rights so as\nto keep the members of certain social groups, notably women, blacks,\nand wage-workers, in their subordinate status. The claims of members\nof those groups to the franchise were denied with the assertion that,\neven though all citizens were entitled to civil rights, not all were\nentitled to political rights. The franchise was said to be, not a\nright, but rather a \u201cprivilege,\u201d properly conferred only on those who\nwere fit to exercise it in a way that would promote the good of\nsociety (Keyssar: 38 and 177). And the claims of blacks to be served\nby a business or to travel in a railroad car to which whites had\naccess were denied with the assertion that civil rights did not touch\nupon social matters such as the decisions of persons and businesses to\nassociate with the members of one race but not another. Such decisions\nwere said to be analogous to a person\u2019s choice of friends or\ndinner guests.\n\nIn the decades following the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled\nthat, as a matter of constitutional law, political rights were not\namong the rights held by all adult citizens and that Congress had no\nauthority to prohibit racial discrimination in access to the goods and\nservices of private firms that catered to the public. In Minor v.\nHappersett, the Court invoked the civil-political distinction in\nholding that, even though women were undoubtedly citizens, \u201cthe\nConstitution, when it conferred citizenship, did not necessarily\nconfer the right of suffrage\u201d (1874: 177). And in the Civil Rights\nCases, the Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875,\nwriting that the Constitution did not confer upon Congress the power\n\u201cto adjust what may be called the social rights of men and races in\nthe community, but only to declare and vindicate those fundamental\nrights which appertain to the essence of citizenship\u201d (1883: 22).\n\nAccordingly, the court used the civil-political-social distinction to\nformulate its conception of citizenship, and its conception licensed a\nhierarchical sorting of citizens by sex and race. The court\u2019s\nrulings and reasoning reflected the dominant views of race and sex in\nAmerican society at the time and for decades thereafter. Those views\ndid not go unchallenged, however. Challenges were mounted by the women\nin the suffrage movement and by blacks, who argued that access to the\nballot was needed for the effective enjoyment of the rights to\nproperty, contract and the other traditional civil rights. \n3.2 Social and Welfare Rights\n\nIn an influential essay first published in 1950, the British\nsociologist T.H. Marshall posited \u201can evolution of citizenship which\nhas been in continuous progress for some 250 years\u201d (Marshall and\nBottomore 1987: 7). Marshall employed a tripartite distinction that\nwas, in some ways, similar to the traditional distinction found in the\nopinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, but his purpose was very different\nfrom any effort to hierarchically sort citizens into different\ncategories with differing sets of rights. He assumed that the rights\nof citizenship should be the same for all, and his aim was to show\nthat the set of rights had been expanding over the centuries.\n\nMarshall distinguished civil, political, and social rights, and he\nargued that, over the course of several centuries, the idea of\ncitizenship had progressively expanded from encompassing only civil\nrights to including political rights and then, during the\n20th century, to incorporating social rights. His\ndistinction between civil and political rights tracked the line that\nthe U.S. Supreme Court had drawn during the 19th century\nbetween rights to property, contract, due process etc., on the one\nside, and the rights to vote and hold office, on the other. But what\nhe meant by the term \u2019social rights\u2019 was very different\nfrom what the U.S. Supreme Court had in mind.\n\nMarshall explained that \u2019social rights\u2019 referred to \u201cthe\nwhole range [of rights] from the right to a modicum of economic\nwelfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social\nheritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the\nstandards prevailing in the society\u201d (8). Included were rights to \u201ca\nminimum supply of certain essential goods and services (such as\nmedical attention and supplies, shelter and education) or a minimum\nmoney income available to be spent on essentials\u201d (32).\nMarshall\u2019s social rights were thus radically different from the\nrights that the Supreme Court had invoked in the Civil Rights\nCases: the court\u2019s rights were the rights of persons to\nassociate with others who wanted to associate with them and to exclude\nfrom their circle anyone whom they pleased, while Marshall\u2019s\nwere rights to a share of basic social goods access to which he\nthought was essential to individual well-being, or welfare.\nAccordingly, Marshall was suggesting that what came to be called\n\u201cwelfare rights\u201d were among the rights of free and equal citizens and\nthus were \u201ccivil rights\u201d in the broad sense. \n\nIn many wealthy countries today, but not in the U.S., welfare rights\nare protected as a matter of constitutional principle. For example,\nSection 75 of the Danish Constitution provides that \u201cany person unable\nto support himself or his dependents shall, where no other person is\nresponsible for his or their maintenance, be entitled to receive\npublic assistance.\u201d And the German Federal Constitutional Court has\nfound that the country\u2019s Basic Law establishes a \u201cSozialstaat\u201d\n(reflecting Marshall\u2019s use of \u2019social\u2019) and secures\nfor every member of society an enforceable right to be provided by\ngovernment the \u201cmaterial prerequisites which are indispensable\nfor his or her physical existence and for a minimum of participation\nin social, cultural and political life\u201d (Egidy 2011: 1964).\n3.3 Cultural Rights\n\nCultural rights include language rights for members of cultural\nminorities and the rights of indigenous peoples to preserve their\ncultural institutions and practices and to exercise some measure of\npolitical autonomy. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights declares that such rights ought to be protected:\n\u201cIn those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities\nexist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the\nright, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy\ntheir own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to\nuse their own language.\u201d Similarly, the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms protects the language rights of minorities, and section 27\nprovides, \u201cThis Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent\nwith the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of\nCanadians.\u201d In the United States, the Voting Rights Act protects the\nspeakers of certain minority languages (52 U.S.C. \u00a710303), and\nconstitutional doctrine recognizes native Indian tribes as having some\nrights of political self-rule.\n\nThere is substantial philosophical controversy over the legitimacy and\nscope of rights of cultural membership. Kymlicka has argued that the\nliberal commitment to protect the equal rights of individuals requires\nsociety to protect such rights, suitably defined (1989; 1994; 1995).\nHe distinguishes among three sorts of rights that have been claimed by\nvarious groups whose culture differs from the dominant culture of a\ncountry: (1) rights of self-government, involving a claim to a degree\nof political autonomy to be exercised through the minority\nculture\u2019s own institutions, (2) polyethnic rights, involving\nspecial claims by members of the minority culture to facilitate their\nintegration into mainstream institutions and practices, and (3)\nrepresentational rights, involving a special claim of the minority\nculture to have its members serve in legislatures and other political\nbodies of the broader society (1995: 27\u201333). \n\nKymlicka argues that these three sorts of group rights can, in\nprinciple, be justified for those populations that he designates as\n\u201cnational minorities,\u201d such as native Americans in the\nUnited States and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Aboriginals in\nCanada. A national minority is \u201can intergenerational community,\nmore or less institutionally complete, occupying a given territory or\nhomeland, [and] sharing a distinct language and history\u201d (18).\nKymlicka contends that \u201cgranting special representational\nrights, land claims, or language rights to a [national] minority\n\u2026 can be seen as putting \u2026 [it] on a more equal footing\n[with the majority], by reducing the extent to which the smaller group\nis vulnerable to the larger\u201d (36\u201337). Such special rights\ndo not involve granting to the national minority the authority to take\naway any of the civil rights of its members. Rather, the rights are\n\u201cexternal protections,\u201d providing the group with powers and\nimmunities with which it can protect its culture against the\npotentially harmful decisions of the broader society (35).\n\nAccording to Kymlicka, in contrast to national minorities (and\nrefugees), most immigrants have left their original cultures\nvoluntarily and so are entitled only to a much more limited set of\ngroup rights. These \u201cpolyethnic rights\u201d are claims to have\ncertain adjustments or accommodations made in the prevailing laws and\nregulations so as to give individuals access to the social mainstream.\nThus, Kymlicka thinks that Orthodox Jews in the U.S. Armed Forces\nshould have the legal right to wear a yarmulke while on duty and\nCanadian Sikhs have a legitimate claim to be exempt from motorcycle\nhelmet laws (31).\n\nKymlicka\u2019s distinction between national minorities and\nimmigrants has been criticized by Choudhry, who writes that \u201cin\nthe majority of cases the decision to immigrate is not free\u201d\n(2002: 64) due to entrenched features of the global economy and other\nfactors beyond the control of immigrants. But Patten defends a\nqualified form of Kymlicka\u2019s distinction, arguing that, in light\nof the benefits received by immigrants and a moral prerogative that\nstates enjoy to pursue their own national projects, \u201ca modest\nprioritizing of the claims of national minorities over those of\nimmigrants is reasonable and permissible\u201d (2014: 295\u201396).\n\nHowever, Patten holds that Kymlicka\u2019s approach is deficient when\nit comes to cultural minorities \u2014 including immigrants\n\u2014who are geographically-dispersed and lack institutions that\ncould serve as the basis for their collective self-government.\nContra Kymlicka, Patten argues that, as a matter of justice,\nsuch persons have a right that their cultural practices enjoy a level\nof recognition and accommodation from the state that is equal to what\nthe majority culture enjoys. This right derives from a liberal\nstate\u2019s \u201cobligation to extend a fair opportunity for self-\ndetermination to all its citizens,\u201d (29) an obligation entailing\nthat the state \u201chas the responsibility to be neutral toward the\nvarious conceptions of the good that are affirmed by its\ncitizens\u201d (27). The appropriate form of neutrality (what Patten\ncalls \u201cneutrality of treatment\u201d) is achieved when the\nstate provides comparable facilities, resources, and opportunities to\nthe members of cultural minority groups so that they are neither\ndisadvantaged nor advantaged, relative to those in the cultural\nmajority, when it comes to pursuing identity-related aspects of their\nconceptions of the good. Patten explains identity-related features as\nones that are not simply preferences but help to define a\nperson\u2019s sense of who she is and hold a place of central\nimportance in a person\u2019s system of ends.\n\nAccording to Patten, among the areas in which a state might be called\nupon to extend special rights to cultural minorities are language,\nholidays, and the arrangement of substate political divisions. For\nexample, neutrality of treatment might require the state to supply its\nservices, such as assistance with tax preparations or information\nregarding health matters, in the languages of cultural minorities.\nAlthough such accommodations would go well beyond what Kymlicka has\nendorsed, Patten agrees with him that the underlying aim of cultural\nrights is not to ensure the survival of a culture. As Patten puts it,\nsuch rights \u201care not rights to cultural preservation\u201d\n(29). Once a framework of fair opportunity is established, whatever\ncultural outcome that emerges is just, even if some cultures\n\u201cstruggle or \u2026 disappear altogether\u201d (29).\n\nNotwithstanding their differences, the positions of Patten and\nKymlicka occupy a middle ground between views that are largely\nantagonistic to the idea of cultural rights and views that embrace\nsuch rights on the ground that the survival of cultures has an\nintrinsic importance, irreducible to the interests of individuals.\nBarry takes the former, antagonistic view, while Taylor takes the\nlatter.\n\nBarry asserts that \u201cthere are certain rights against oppression,\nexploitation, and injury, to which every single human being is\nentitled to lay claim, and \u2026 appeals to cultural diversity and\npluralism under no circumstances trump the value of basic liberal\nrights\u201d (2001: 132\u201333). The legal system should protect\nthose rights by impartially imposing the same rules on all persons,\nregardless of their cultural or religious membership. Barry allows for\na few exceptions, such as the accommodation of a Sikh boy whose turban\nviolated school dress regulations, but thinks that the conditions\nunder which such exceptions will be justified \u201care rarely\nsatisfied\u201d (2001: 62).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Taylor (1994) argues for a form of\ncommunitarianism that attaches intrinsic importance to the survival of\ncultures. In his view, differential treatment under the law for\ncertain practices is sometimes justifiable on the ground that such\ntreatment is important for keeping a culture alive. And Taylor\ncontends that cultural survival can sometimes override basic\nindividual rights, such as freedom of speech. Accordingly, he defends\nlegal restrictions on the use of English in Quebec, invoking the\nsurvival of Quebec\u2019s French culture.\n4. The Right to Vote\n\nConflict over who should have the right to vote has been a part of the\nhistory of modern representative government ever since its emergence\nin England during the 17th century. Because elections are\ncentral to such systems of governance and the different groups that\nmake up society have competing political interests, the issue of which\nsegments of the population should have the franchise has long been\ncontested. Property and sex qualifications drastically limited the\nfranchise into the 20th century. Opposition to universal\nmanhood suffrage came from those claiming that men without sufficient\nproperty lacked the independence of mind and the stake in the good of\nthe community needed for the responsible exercise of the franchise\n(Keyssar 2000: 8\u201310). After industrialization produced a large class\nof wage-workers, a common argument against universal suffrage was that\ngiving workers the right to vote would result in the establishment of\na disastrous socialist or communist regime. Opposition to\nwomen\u2019s suffrage came from those who embraced the traditional\npatriarchal idea that the inherent capacities of women suited them,\nnot for the public world of politics, but for the restricted private\ndomain of family life and the household (Keyssar 2000: 141). \n\nIn the U.S., the right to vote for black men was achieved de\njure shortly after the Civil War, but throughout the South the\nright was de facto denied until the Civil Rights Movement led\nto the Voting Rights Act of 1965. However, efforts to deny blacks the\nvote and to dilute their voting power survived the act (secs. 4.1\n\u2013 4.3 below).\n4.1 The Disenfranchisement of Black Americans\n\nThe 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in\n1870, a landmark of the Reconstruction era in which radical\nRepublicans and their allies sought to ensure that America\u2019s\nfreedmen and their fellow blacks would be free and equal citizens. The\namendment prohibits the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on\naccount of race and authorizes Congress to enact \u201cappropriate\nlegislation\u201d to implement the prohibition. But it would take a\ncentury after the amendment\u2019s ratification before blacks across\nthe South could register and vote free from widespread and overt\ndiscrimination and a well-grounded fear of economic coercion and\nretaliatory violence. Even during Reconstruction, when many blacks\ncould vote under the protection of federal troops occupying the South\nat the time, there was routine discrimination and violence against\nblacks seeking to exercise their constitutional right. \n\nThe Supreme Court gave a tortured interpretation to federal\nlegislation that sought to protect black voting rights, declaring that\nthe legislation was not \u201cappropriate\u201d as a basis for the\nprosecution of state officials who had flagrantly prevented blacks\nfrom registering to vote (U.S. v. Reese 1875). And after a\nbackroom deal enabled Rutherford Hayes to win the contested\npresidential election of 1876, his administration instructed federal\ntroops to end their efforts to protect the rights of blacks. With the\nconsequent demise of Reconstruction, the path was opened for Southern\nwhites to turn the 15th Amendment into a dead letter. \n\nSouthern states proceeded to adopt literacy requirements and other\ntests of a voter\u2019s knowledge, poll taxes, and a variety of other\nmeasures that, applied in a discriminatory manner by local registrars\nand combined with terrorist violence and economic coercion, succeeded\nin disenfranchising the vast majority of blacks in the region. And\ndespite the open defiance of the 15th Amendment, in Giles v.\nHarris (1903), the Supreme Court declared that the federal\njudiciary was not the place to go for blacks who sought the abrogation\nof the system of disenfranchisement. Justice Holmes wrote for the\ncourt that \u201crelief from a great political wrong, if done, as\nalleged, by the people of a state and the state itself must be given\nby them or by the legislative and political department of the\ngovernment of the United States\u201d (488). But Holmes and every\nother minimally-informed American at the time knew full well that\nthere was no realistic possibility that Southern states or Congress\nwould voluntarily act to protect the voting rights of blacks. \n\nIt was clear to blacks that, without the franchise, they had no\nprospect of securely enjoying their legal rights to property,\ncontract, due process and the other claims that had been traditionally\nregarded as the fundamental rights of free and equal citizens. With no\npolitical power, Southern blacks were exposed to ruthless exploitation\nand oppression at the hands of whites, which was the reason why whites\nundertook their disenfranchisement schemes in the first place. The\nexperience of Reconstruction had taught whites that the vote was a\npower that blacks would use to secure their other legal rights. It was\nno accident that one of the principal aims of the Civil Rights\nMovement would be the enactment of effective federal legislation to\nprotect voting rights. \n4.2 The Voting Rights Act\n\nAmong the most effective and important pieces of legislation to come\nout of the Civil Rights Movement was the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n(VRA). The act effected a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (Davidson and\nGrofman 1994) in the political systems of southern states by greatly\nreducing the legal power those states had traditionally enjoyed to\ndetermine the rules by which their electoral systems operated. The\nbroad consensus among historians and political scientists is that the\nVRA put an end to the massive disenfranchisement of southern blacks,\nas black voter registration rates increased exponentially across\nSouthern states in just a few years after enactment (Wright 2013:\n183). Additionally, studies have shown that, with the help of\npersistent litigation based on the act, the number of black elected\nofficials, especially at the local level, increased substantially\n(184). In his assessment of the effects of the VRA, Wright concludes\nthat \u201cit is undeniable that local political participation [by\nblacks] generated positive change in aspects important to [their]\ncommunities and their members \u2026 . [b]y ensuring that gains from\neconomic growth would be more broadly shared\u201d than would\notherwise have been the case (184). Those gains included the provision\nof basic public services that many black communities in the South had\nbeen previously denied due to discrimination, services such as paved\nroads, streetlights, fire stations, and sewage treatment\nfacilities.\n\nThe VRA took a series of unprecedented steps in shifting the power to\nregulate elections from the states to the national government. The\ntraditional understanding had been that, under the Constitution,\nstates had the exclusive and final power to determine the rules by\nwhich elections for state and local offices were held. The VRA\noverturned that understanding, inserting federal power into the\nsovereign domain of the states. \n\nSection 2 of the VRA contained a nationwide ban on any voting\nqualification or procedure that denied or abridged a citizen\u2019s\nright to vote on account of race or color. The act went on to provide\nremedies to make the ban effective in jurisdictions that had been\nparticularly egregious in their violations of the 15th Amendment. The\nremedies applied to jurisdictions that met two conditions (the\n\u201ccoverage formula\u201d): 1) as of November 1964, the\njurisdiction was using a literacy test or some similar device to\ndetermine eligibility to register, and 2) the proportion of eligible\nvoters in the jurisdiction who were registered on that date, or who\nhad turned out to vote in the election that year, was below 50%. The\nidea was that low overall registration or voting rates (under 50%) was\nan objective indicator that a sizeable proportion of the eligible\nvoters were being denied access to the ballot for racially\ndiscriminatory reasons. Measures authorized for use against\njurisdictions that met the coverage formula included the invalidation\nof literacy tests, the appointment of federal examiners to replace\nlocal registrars and to compile the voting rolls, and, under Section\n5, the requirement to gain federal approval (typically from the\nAttorney General) for any changes in rules governing elections\n(\u201cthe preclearance requirement\u201d). Seven southern states\nfell under the coverage formula. \n\nThe constitutionality of the key provisions of the VRA was challenged\nby the states that fell under the formula, but the Supreme Court\nupheld the law in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). The\nact was then reauthorized several times with some alterations. The\nalterations sought to strengthen protections against what were called\n\u201csecond- generation\u201d barriers to racial equality in the\nelectoral process. The first generation had included literacy tests\nand the other devices that were applied in discriminatory fashion to\nblock blacks from registering. The second generation consisted of\nvarious ways that the political power of registered minority voters\nwas diluted by electoral arrangements. \n\nConsider the following example of vote dilution. In many counties in\nthe South, whites were in the overall majority but blacks were a\nmajority in certain parts of the county. The counties had been\ntraditionally divided into districts, with each district electing a\nmember of the county board. First-generation discrimination ensured\nall-white boards by blocking black registration in majority-black\ndistricts. When first-generation devices were invalidated as a result\nof the VRA, many southern counties switched from a district-based\nsystem to at-large voting, so that the white majority in the county as\na whole could continue to elect an all-white board. The Supreme Court\nheld that such changes were subject to a preclearance review by\nfederal authorities, who were empowered to prohibit the changes\n(Allen v. State Board of Elections 1969). And treating\ndilution as a form of racial discrimination, in 1982, Congress amended\nsection 2 to prohibit any electoral rule or arrangement that\n\u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen\nof the United States to vote on account of race or color \u2026 .\n[or being] a member of a language minority group\u201d (52 U.S.C.\n10301 and 10303).\n\nFor more than four decades, the preclearance requirement of section 5\nand litigation based on section 2 were used to stop racial vote\ndilution and a range of other electoral arrangements that were deemed\nracially discriminatory. Then the Supreme Court upended preclearance\nin its ruling in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). \n4.3 The Shelby Case and Its Aftermath\n\nIn Shelby County, the Supreme Court struck down the coverage\nformula of the VRA, thereby rendering impotent Section 5\u2019s\npreclearance provision: with no coverage formula, no jurisdictions\ncould be picked out as ones needing to receive federal approval for\nchanging their electoral rules. The formula had been last updated in\nthe early 1970\u2019s, and, writing for the court, Chief Justice\nRoberts found that the use of the formula had become\n\u201cirrational\u201d in light of the \u201cdramatic [racial]\nprogress\u201d that had been made in the intervening decades (554 and\n556). He pointed out that the jurisdictions covered by the formula had\nrates of black voter registration and turnout as high, and in some\ncases higher, than the rates for whites, and that minorities had come\nto hold office \u201cat unprecedented levels\u201d (547) in those\nstates.\n\nJustice Roberts did not deny the existence of second-generation\nbarriers, but he argued that Congress had failed to reshape the\ncoverage formula to track the parts of the country in which such\nbarriers were most prevalent at present. Accordingly, he did not see a\nrational relationship between the formula and any remaining obstacles\nto racial discrimination in voting. Moreover, he contended that\nSection 5 constituted a \u201cdramatic departure from the principle\nthat all states enjoy equal sovereignty\u201d (535). In light of such\na departure from a principle that he regarded as fundamental, Roberts\nconcluded that Congress lacked the constitutional power to impose the\nold coverage formula.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg emphasized the evidential record that\nCongress had compiled prior to its 2006 reauthorization of the law.\nThat record led Congress to the conclusion that the old coverage\nformula was adequate to target those jurisdictions where\nsecond-generation barriers were most prevalent. For example, the\nrecord contained a study showing that covered areas were much more\nlikely to be successfully sued in Section 2 litigation than other\njurisdictions. Accordingly, Ginsburg judged that \u201cCongress had\nreasonably concluded that the coverage formula continues to identify\nthe jurisdictions of greatest concern\u201d (578). She also construed\nthe \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d principle as applying only to the\nvery limited circumstance in which a new state was being admitted to\nthe union: the new state must not be accorded a lesser, or greater,\ndegree of sovereignty than the existing states.\n\nRoberts is correct to see the VRA as a \u201cdramatic\ndeparture\u201d (535) from the traditional legal view of the power of\nthe national government to regulate state elections. As Ackerman\nstresses, the act was a radical piece of legislation, akin to a\nconstitutional amendment in the way that it overturned long-settled\nlegal understandings (2014). Nonetheless, Roberts\u2019s argument\nthat Congress must reshape the coverage formula is not convincing. On\nthe surface, it appears unreasonable for Congress to rely on an old\nformula despite important changes in the situation of blacks. But the\nfact that a situation has changed in some relevant respects does not\nmean that it has changed in all such respects, and a closer look by\nCongress determined that in one respect matters had not changed: the\nsame jurisdictions picked out by the old formula still had the most\nproblematic records in upholding the rights of blacks to an undiluted\nvote. Roberts glosses over the fact that increases in registration\namong blacks do not address the problem of racial vote dilution, and,\nalthough he is correct that black officeholding rates have increased\nconsiderably since 1970, it was reasonable for Congress to conclude\nthat the increase was due largely to vigorous federal enforcement\nbased on the old coverage formula.\n\nIn the wake of Shelby, states that had been subject to the\nfederal preclearance requirement (as well as a number of states that\nhad not been subject to it) have adopted laws and practices that make\nvoting more difficult than it had previously been and that\ndisproportionately disadvantage blacks, members of indigenous tribes,\nand other racial minorities. These laws and practices include photo ID\nand proof of citizenship requirements, restrictions on early voting\nand mail-in ballots, and a reduction in the number of polling places.\nThe prevention of voter fraud is the main rationale offered for such\nmeasures. However, litigation challenging the measures has been\nmounted across the country. Where a discriminatory intent can be\nshown, the measures are vulnerable to judicial invalidation (NAACP\nv. McCrory 2016), but absent a \u201csmoking gun\u201d showing\nsuch intent, the measures have been generally upheld (see, e.g.,\nBrnovich v. D.N.C. 2021). Their critics have contended that\nthe measures violate section 2 of the VRA because their\ndisproportionate racial impact means that the measures \u201cresult[\n] in \u2026 [a]n abridgment of the right to vote\u201d on account\nof race (VRA: section 2; Commission on Civil Rights 2018; Herron and\nSmith 2016). But legal and philosophical questions remain about how to\ninterpret the results-oriented language of section 2 and whether an\nintent to discriminate should be seen as a necessary element of any\nviable claim of racial discrimination in electoral arrangements\n(Altman 1998). \n5. Criminal Justice and Racial Profiling\n\nIn recent years, the criminal justice system has become a focal point\nin the discussion of civil rights in the United States. A number of\ncommentators have argued that the system amounts to a \u201cnew Jim\nCrow,\u201d reducing blacks to an inferior, caste-like status\n(Alexander 2012; for criticism of the Jim Crow analogy, see Forman\n2012). Yet, even apart from such arguments, civil rights concerns have\nbeen raised about every dimension of criminal justice in the U.S.,\nfrom the investigation and arrest of suspects to the imposition of the\ndeath penalty. And issues of racial equality with respect to criminal\njustice are hardly limited to the U.S. (Clarke: 9\u201310). In France, for\nexample, race-based abuse perpetrated by the police is a matter of\nserious public concern, and the office of Defender of Rights has found\nthat persons perceived as black or Arab are 20 times as likely to be\nstopped by police as members of the general population (Bredeen and\nMorenne 2017).\n\nAmong the most controversial tactics used by police in determining who\nhas committed a crime is racial (and ethnic) profiling. The tactic has\ngiven rise to the charge that it violates the civil rights of those\nwhom it targets, and, in some cases, the courts have agreed with the\ncharge. In State v. Soto, for example, a New Jersey court\nfound that police traffic stops targeted blacks and amounted to a\n\u201cselective enforcement\u201d (351) of the law and a violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Nonetheless,\ndebate continues over when, if ever, it is justifiable for police to\nuse race in deciding whom to stop and question.\n\nRisse and Zeckhauser formulate a philosophically sophisticated defense\nof racial profiling. They argue that, even in a racist society like\nthe United States, such profiling is justifiable under conditions\nplausibly thought to exist in a range of cases. Their argument\ncombines utilitarian and deontological considerations: the utilitarian\nstrand regards profiling as contributing to the public good of crime\ncontrol, while the deontological line of argument aims to rebut claims\nthat profiling is objectionably discriminatory and unfair to persons\nwhom it harms.\n\nRisse and Zeckhauser acknowledge that police abuse can be coupled with\nprofiling, but they insist that \u201cabuse and profiling \u2026\nare different problems that must be assessed\nindependently\u201d (139; emphasis in original). Profiling is\n\u201cany police initiated-action that relies on the race, ethnicity,\nor national origin and not merely on the behavior of an\nindividual\u201d (136). Such action need not involve any abusive\npolice behavior, such as \u201crude words, demeaning demands,\nphysical force, or physical injury\u201d (138). Abuse \u201cmust be\nrectified independently\u201d (139) of profiling.\n\nSome critics of profiling contend that it is wholly ineffective as a\ncrime control measure. Risse and Zeckhauser point out that if this\ncontention is true, then there is no issue: profiling is unjustifiable\non that premise. But they reason that, even if some forms of profiling\nmake no net contribution to crime control, it seems unlikely that all\nforms fit that description, given \u201ca significant correlation\nbetween membership in certain racial groups and the tendency to commit\ncertain crimes\u201d (132).\n\nRacial minorities feel aggrieved by profiling, and Risse and\nZeckhauser do not disregard that fact. However, they claim that the\ngrievance rests largely on \u201cthe underlying systematic\nracism\u201d (145) of society and that the harm done to minorities by\nprofiling is \u201csmall\u201d (169) in comparison to the harm done\nby that underlying racism. For example, African Americans would be\n\u201conly slightly\u201d better off if profiling were eliminated,\n\u201ckeeping everything else fixed\u201d (149; emphasis in\noriginal). \u201c[T]he harm attached to profiling per se,\u201d they\nexplain, \u201cis expressive\u201d (146; emphasis in\noriginal). Profiling is \u201ca symbol of structural\ndisadvantage\u201d (147) but \u201cnot the primary cause of \u2026\nthe sense of hurt among minorities\u201d (149). In the utilitarian\ncalculus of Risse and Zeckhauser, the harms that count against the\nbenefits flowing from more effective crime control are\n\u201ccomparatively modest\u201d (149), viz., symbolic harms plus\nthe temporary inconveniences of being stopped and questioned by the\npolice. These modest harms are, in their view, likely to be outweighed\nin a range of cases by the benefits.\n\nAdditionally, Risse and Zeckhauser argue that racial profiling per se\nis not objectionably discriminatory, because it has neither \u201cthe\nintention or the effect of maintaining or establishing an\noppressive relationship\u201d between the races (153;\nemphasis in original). When it does not involve abuse, profiling has\nthe intention of crime control, and, because profiling \u201cis\nitself parasitic on an underlying oppressive relationship\u201d (154)\nand does (mainly) symbolic harm, it \u201cdoes not contribute to [an]\noppressive relationship\u201d (155).\n\nCritics of Risse and Zeckhauser argue that profiling is not only a\nsymbol of society\u2019s underlying racism but that it also\ncontributes materially to such racism and its harmful effects.\nEidelson argues that \u201cthe use of race as a proxy for criminality\nis likely to be taken as validation for racist assumptions, and\nthereby to nurture the very prejudices which contribute most directly\nto [racially] oppressive relationships\u201d (2015: 215). In a\nsimilar vein, Lever contends that profiling \u201cencourages us to\nsee black people as perpetrators\u201d and that \u201cracial\nprofiling exacerbates problems of police abuse\u201d because such\nprofiling \u201cconveys a message that black people are \u2026\ndangerous\u201d (2007: 24). And Hosein contends that blacks and\ncertain other groups, such as Muslims and persons of Middle Eastern\ndescent, \u201ccan reasonably assume that profiling\ncontributes to police abuse in so far as police officers\n(even if mistakenly) take it to license harsh treatment of those\ngroups\u201d (2018: e17; emphasis in original).\n\nHosein also argues, more fundamentally, that a policy of profiling\nblacks and other groups gives the members of those groups good reason\nto think that the government \u201csubstantially discounts [their]\nrights and interests\u201d relative to the rest of society and is\nthereby consigning them to an \u201cinferior political status\u201d\n(e5). In opposition to utilitarian defenses of profiling, he holds\nthat government has a duty of justice to avoid actions that make it\nreasonable for members of the political community to believe that they\nare being consigned to such a status: equal citizenship must be\nsecured by government, and all citizens must have sufficient grounds\nfor confidence that equality is secured for them. \n\nMogensen contends that, contra Risse and Zeckhauser, racial\nprofiling is pro tanto and inherently wrong because it\ndisrespects a person\u2019s interest in being treated in a way that\nreflects her merits as determined by personal features over which she\nhas control. He points out that other forms of differential treatment\nbased on statistical generalizations about unchosen features \u2013\nsuch as minimum age requirements for obtaining a driver\u2019s\nlicense-- are also unfair for disrespecting that interest. But\nMogensen\u2019s central claim is that, unlike those other forms,\n\u201cracial profiling of black citizens [is] especially problematic\ninsofar as it is one of a number of injustices that together\nconstitute \u2026 . a systematic pattern of injustice\u201d\ninflicted on blacks and through which they are subordinated to whites\n(2019: 467). He notes that, on his account, racial profiling would be\nseriously wrongful, even if it were kept secret from the public and\nincreased the efficiency of law enforcement. \n\nReiman agrees with Risse and Zeckhauser that some forms of racial\nprofiling can make a significant contribution to overall safety, but\nhe also supports Lever\u2019s view that racial profiling in a racist\nsociety is likely to exacerbate racism and increase the violation of\nthe rights of those victimized by it. While he holds that\n\u201cprofiling is not intrinsically racist\u201d (2011: 17), Reiman\nargues that Risse and Zeckhauser have not set the bar sufficiently\nhigh for profiling to be justified. He contends that, in light of its\nlikely exacerbation of existing racism, \u201cracial profiling [must]\nbe used only for grave crimes and only where there is abundant\nevidence of its likelihood of significantly increasing apprehension of\nperpetrators of such crimes\u201d (17). In a similar vein, Hosein\nargues that profiling is justified only when the social benefits are\n\u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201cthere are no other means of\nachieving the same benefits without creating similar injustice\u201d\n(2018: e16). For Reiman, Hosein and other critics, then, an adequate\nappreciation of the connection of racial profiling to systemic\ninjustice compels the conclusion that, if profiling can be justified\nat all, it is in a narrower range of circumstances that what the\nRisse- Zeckhauser argument allows. \n6. Marriage Equality\n\nAmong the most highly contested civil rights issues of recent years\nhas been the question of whether marriage laws should be extended to\ninclude same-sex couples. Over the past two decades, a number of\ncountries have liberalized their laws to enable such couples to become\nmarried, despite the opposition of those who think that it is morally\nor theologically unjustified to alter the traditional understanding of\nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman. The countries that\ncurrently recognize same-sex marriages include the Netherlands,\nBelgium, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Mexico,\nPortugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, Brazil, France, England, New\nZealand, and the United States. In most of these countries, nationwide\nsame-sex marriage was brought about by legislation. But in the United\nStates, the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges\n(2015) extended same-sex marriage from ten states to all fifty.\n\nMost scholars working in the areas of philosophy and legal theory\nendorse a principle of equal treatment for same-sex and heterosexual\ncouples and argue that equal treatment requires that same-sex\nmarriages be legalized (Wardle 1996; Eskridge 1996; Balkin 2020).\nHowever, there are dissenting voices in the literature, rejecting\nmarriage equality. These voices do not argue in favor the traditional\npractice of criminalizing same-sex relations, although some contend\nthat such relations are \u201cmanifestly unworthy of the human being\nand immoral\u201d (Finnis 1996: 14). But they all argue that\nextending marriage to same-sex couples flouts important values and\nprinciples.\n\nMany advocates of a right to same-sex marriage argue that abridging a\nperson\u2019s right to marry on the basis of sexual orientation is\nobjectionable for the same reasons that abridging that right on the\nbasis of race cannot be justified: both forms of restriction are\narbitrary deprivations of a fundamental civil right (Koh et al.:\n18\u201319 and 42). However, such an argument proceeds too\nquickly. In the eyes of opponents, the analogy between race and sexual\norientation is inapt: the considerations they invoke against same-sex\nmarriage, such as the interests of children or the distinctive nature\nof heterosexual intercourse, do not apply to interracial\nmarriages. Accordingly, arguments about same-sex marriage must engage\nwith those considerations.\n\nFinnis (1996), Lee (1997) and George (1997) make their case against\nsame-sex marriage by invoking natural law. However, unlike traditional\nversions of natural law theory, their version does not rest on any\nexplicit theological or metaphysical claims. Rather, it invokes\nindependent principles of practical reasoning that articulate the\nbasic reasons for action. Such reasons are the fundamental goods that\naction is capable of realizing and, for Finnis, Lee and George,\ninclude \u201cmarriage, the conjuntio of man and woman\u201d (Finnis\n1996: 4). Homosexual conduct, masturbation, and all extra-marital sex\naim strictly at \u201cindividual gratification\u201d and can be no\npart of any \u201ccommon good.\u201d Such actions \u201charm the\ncharacter\u201d of those voluntarily choosing them (Lee and George,\n1997: 135), and, in taking the actions, the individual becomes a slave\nto his passions, allowing his reason to be overridden by his raw\ndesire for sensuous pleasure.\n\nOn Finnis\u2019s account, when consensual sexual conduct is private,\ngovernment may not outlaw it, but government \u201ccan rightly judge\nthat it has a compelling interest in denying that \u2018gay\nlifestyles\u2019 are a valid and humanly acceptable choice and form\nof life\u201d (1996: 17). And for Finnis, Lee and George, equal\ntreatment of same-sex and heterosexual relations is out of the\nquestion due to the morally defective character of same-sex\nrelations.\n\nMacedo responds to Finnis by arguing that \u201call of the goods that\ncan be shared by sterile heterosexual couples can also be shared by\ncommitted homosexual couples\u201d (1996: 39). Macedo points out that\nFinnis does not condemn sexual intercourse by sterile heterosexual\ncouples. But Finnis replies that there is a relevant difference\nbetween homosexual couples and sterile heterosexual ones: the latter\nbut not the former are united \u201cbiologically\u201d when they\nhave intercourse. Lee and George make essentially the same point: only\nheterosexual couples can \u201ctruly become one body, one\norganism\u201d (1997: 150). But Macedo points out that, biologically,\nit is not the man and woman who unite but the sperm and the egg (1996:\n37). It can be added that the \u201cbiological unity\u201d argument\nseems to run contrary to Finnis\u2019s claim that his position\n\u201cdoes not seek to infer normative conclusions from non-normative\n(natural-fact) premises\u201d (1997: 16). More importantly, Macedo\nand Koppelman make the key point that the human good realized in\nintimate relations is a function of \u201cmutual commitment and\nstable engagement\u201d (Macedo, 1996: 40) and that same-sex couples\ncan achieve \u201cthe precise kind of human good\u201d that is\navailable to heterosexual ones (Koppelman, 1997: 1649). Accordingly,\nequal treatment under the law for same-sex couples, including the\nrecognition of same-sex marriage, would remove unjustifiable obstacles\nfaced by those couples to the achievement of that human good.\n\nCorvino explains one of the central human goods provided by marriage\nin this way: marriage involves two individuals mutually and publicly\ncommitting to be the \u201cNumber One Person\u201d for the other in\nsharing the benefits and alleviating the burdens that life brings\n(Corvino and Gallagher: 15). Sterile heterosexual couples and those\nunable to have sexual relations for physical reasons are rightly\npermitted to marry to secure that good, and Corvino argues that\n\u201conce the state provides marriage as an option for different-sex\npartners, even if they cannot or choose not to have children; \u2026\n[and] even if they are incapable of coitus, \u2026 but then denies\n[marriage] to same-sex couples, it is treating citizens\nunequally\u201d (89\u201390).\n\nGallagher rejects Corvino\u2019s view, contending that \u201c[t]he\ncritical public or \u2018civil\u2019 task of marriage is to regulate\nsexual relationships between men and women in order to reduce the\nlikelihood that children \u2026 will face the burdens of\nfatherlessness, and increase the likelihood that there will be a next\ngeneration that will be raised by their mothers and fathers in one\nfamily, where both parents are committed to each other and to their\nchildren\u201d (Corvino and Gallagher: 96). She argues that\n\u201cgay marriage is a profound change to the meaning of the word\n\u2018marriage\u2019\u2026 . [b]ecause] it disconnects marriage\nfrom its grounding in the human reality that male-female sexual\nrelationships are different from other kinds of relationships\u201d\n(101).\n\nHowever, Gallagher is not correct to claim that Corvino\u2019s view\nrests on the premise that \u201ca union of two men or two women is\njust the same as a union of husband and wife\u201d (132). The\nquestion is whether the two sorts of union are relevantly similar with\nrespect to values that marriage serves. Corvino claims that, with\nrespect to at least one important value, viz., providing support for\ncouples who want to undertake a mutual and public commitment to be\neach other\u2019s \u201cNumber One Person,\u201d there is no\nrelevant difference. Gallagher weakens her own view when she writes\nthat \u201cgay marriage is wrong first and foremost not because of\nits consequences but because it is a lie\u201d (178), specifically,\nthe lie that same-sex couples \u201care like man and wife\u201d\n(177). Rather, in light of her emphasis on how marriage protects\nchildren (109\u2013115), it would make more sense for her to argue that\nregulating sexual relations between men and women in the interest of\nchildren is the most important social purpose of marriage and that\nmarriage equality threatens the capacity of marriage to serve that\nfunction; she should not deny that marriage has other, socially\nvaluable functions.\n\nCorvino affirms that marriage has an important child-protection\nfunction, while rejecting the idea that it is the sole function (192).\nHis key disagreements with Gallagher are over the importance of those\nother functions and whether there is adequate reason to think that\nmarriage equality threatens the child-protection function. Corvino\nargues that denying same-sex couples access to the human goods that\nmarriage can provide to them is no small matter for those couples and\nthat Gallagher vastly underestimates what such access means to them\n(198). Given how persistently and vigorously same-sex couples have\nfought for marriage equality, it is difficult to disagree with Corvino\non the matter.\n\nCiting studies suggesting that male same-sex couples have a relatively\nweak commitment to sexual fidelity and are relatively unconcerned\nabout their partner having sex outside of the relationship, Gallagher\nargues that same-sex marriage would dilute the commitment to fidelity\namong heterosexual couples, thereby undermining an essential marital\nnorm. And, with the fidelity norm seriously weakened, heterosexual\nmarriages would become more unstable and the interests of children\nwould be harmed.\n\nIn Corvino\u2019s judgment, however, Gallagher\u2019s argument rests\non an \u201cimplausible empirical claim about same-sex couples\u2019\npower to topple majority norms\u201d (195). Gay marriages would be\nonly a tiny fraction of all marriages, and gay marriages between men\nwho are indifferent to fidelity would be an even smaller fraction. One\ncould add to Corvino\u2019s criticism that, even if Gallagher\u2019s\nclaim is not implausible, it does seem to be little more than\nspeculation, and it is problematic to deny a civil right on such\nspeculative grounds to a portion of the adult population that has made\nit clear that, contra Gallagher, the right is very important\nto them. Gallagher might respond that the stakes for society are high,\nclaiming that the well-being of future generations hang in the\nbalance. But essentially the same claims have been made by defenders\nof traditional marriage about every liberalization of the law of\nmarriage, from the dismantling of coverture (which had placed a\nmarried woman almost entirely under the legal power of her husband) to\nthe present controversy over same-sex marriage.\n\nGirgis, Anderson, and George argue that the defense of same-sex\nmarriage rests on a faulty understanding of marriage, what they call\n\u201cthe revisionist view\u201d (4). Such a view derives from the\nsexual revolution of the 1960\u2019s and rejects the understanding\nthat had prevailed in almost every society until then, \u201cthe\nconjugal view\u201d (3).\n\nOn the conjugal view, marriage is a permanent commitment,\n\u201cordered to procreation and family life\u201d (7) and\nconstituting a \u201ccomprehensive union\u201d of a man and a woman.\nThe union joins spouses \u201cin body as well as in mind\u201d and\nis \u201csealed by sexual intercourse\u201d (3). Such a union is\n\u201ca basic human good, a distinctive way of thriving\u201d (35).\nAnd \u201cthere is something special\u201d about a marital\ncouple\u2019s sexual intercourse, because it constitutes the\n\u201chighest kind of bodily unity\u201d (26), a unity not available\nin any other relationship. In having intercourse, the marital partners\n\u201cdo not merely touch or interlock\u201d but unite in a way that\n\u201chas generative significance\u201d and \u201cphysically\nembodies their specific, marital commitment\u201d (36). By contrast,\nthe revisionist view regards marriage as essentially a matter of\n\u201cemotional union and cohabitation\u201d (8). Sex can enhance\nthe emotional connections but is not essential to the marital union,\nand when the emotions cool, the partners might reasonably seek to end\nthe union.\n\nGirgis et al. claim that the revisionist view warps our grasp of what\nmarriage is. They dismiss Corvino\u2019s idea that marriage is a\nmatter of having a \u201cNumber One Person,\u201d arguing that it\n\u201ccannot distinguish marriage from simple companionship\u201d\n(15). Nor can the revisionist view explain why the state should be\ninvolved in regulating marriage or account for the central marital\nnorms of permanence and sexual exclusivity.\n\nCorvino can respond that his defense of marriage equality does not\nrest on the revisionist position, even though he does reject the\nconjugal view. Rather, Corvino is suggesting a way of understanding\nmarriage that gives same-sex partners access to those substantial\ngoods of marriage that are not tied to heterosexual intercourse.\nSecurity in a stable relationship that is publicly and legally\nratified as lasting and exclusive is among those goods. The liberty to\nbreak off a relationship when emotions \u201ccool\u201d is no part\nof Corvino\u2019s understanding of marriage. And although it is true\nthat companionship and friendship can provide a \u201cNumber One\nPerson,\u201d they cannot do so with the same level of assurance that\na legally ratified marriage can.\n\nGirgis et al. might reject Corvino\u2019s view on the ground that it\nrests on mere psychological considerations related to such matters as\nhow secure individuals feel and how likely they are to end a\nrelationship if it is sexually open, whereas their view rests on a\npriori principles concerning objective human goods. However,\nCorvino can respond that his understanding of marriage invokes human\ngoods that are no less objective than Girgis\u2019s\n\u201ccomprehensive union.\u201d Additionally, Corvino might note\nthat, even assuming that heterosexual intercourse unites male and\nfemale partners, his argument proceeds without recourse to such\ncontestable claims as the quasi-metaphysical thesis that such\nintercourse between married partners is \u201cthe highest\u201d form\nof bodily unity and that other sorts of sexual activity are a\n\u201cmere\u201d touching or interlocking of bodily parts.\n\nGirgis et al. think that the conjugal account of marriage reflects its\ntrue nature, but this position appears to have been rejected by most\ndemocratic societies since the liberalization of marriage laws and\nnorms that began with nineteenth-century criticisms of the law of\ncoverture. Blackstone summarized the law as it had been through the\n18th century: \u201cBy marriage, the husband and wife are one person\nin law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is\nsuspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and\nconsolidated into that of the husband\u201d (441). Over the course of\na century and more, coverture was limited and eventually eliminated in\nfavor of marriage equality between husband and wife, though\ntraditionalists repeatedly argued that such changes violated the\nessence of marriage as \u201ca union of person in husband and\nwife\u201d (441). Subsequent changes in the social understanding of\nmarriage were reflected in the rejection of the requirement of sexual\nintercourse for the consummation of marriage and in the spread of\nno-fault divorce laws. Given that such radical changes in the\nunderstanding of marriage have already taken place and been inscribed\nin law, it is unclear how law and society can now consistently or\njustly exclude same-sex couples from forming a marital bond.\n7. Disability\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, persons with disabilities increasingly\nargued that they were treated as second-class citizens by law and\nsociety. They organized into a civil rights movement that pressed for\nlegislation that would help secure for them the status of free and\nequal citizens. Protection against discrimination based on disability\nwas written into the\n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,\n The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities. The disability rights movement in the U.S. culminated\nwith the passage of the\n Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n (ADA). The ADA has served as a model for legislation in countries\nsuch as Australia, India and Israel\n\nThe disability rights movement began with the idea that discrimination\non the basis of disability was not different in any morally important\nway from discrimination based on race. The aim of the movement was to\nenshrine in law the same kind of antidiscrimination principle that\nprotected persons based on their race. But some theorists have\nquestioned how well the analogy holds. They point out that applying\nthe antidiscrimination norm to disability, for example, by installing\nramps for access to buildings or offering special education programs,\nrequires taking account of physical or mental differences among\npeople. This seems to be treatment based on a person\u2019s physical\nor mental features, apparently the exact opposite of the ideal of\n\u201ccolorblindness\u201d behind the traditional antidiscrimination\nprinciple.\n\nEven race-based affirmative action does not really seem to be parallel\nto antidiscrimination policies that take account of disability.\nAdvocates of affirmative action assert that the social ideal is for\npersons not to be treated on the basis of their race or color at all.\nRace-conscious policies are seen as instruments that will move society\ntoward that ideal (Wasserstrom: 2001).\n\nIn contrast, policies designed to counter discrimination based on\ndisability are not sensibly understood as temporary measures or steps\ntoward a goal in which people are not treated based on their\ndisabilities. The policies permanently enshrine the idea that in\ndesigning buildings or buses or constructing some other aspect of our\nphysical-social environment, we must be responsive to the disabilities\npeople have in order for the disabled to have \u201cfair equality of\nopportunity\u201d (Rawls 2001: 43\u201344; Hartley 2009). The need\nfor a permanent \u201caccommodation\u201d of persons with disabilities marks an\nimportant difference in how the antidiscrimination norm should be\nunderstood in the context of disability, as opposed to the context of\nrace. However, it is important to recognize that, at the level of\nfundamental principle, the reasons why disability-based discrimination\nis morally objectionable and even unjust are parallel to the reasons\nwhy racial discrimination is so. At the individual level,\ndisadvantageous treatment of the disabled is often rooted in ill-will,\ndisregard, and moral arbitrariness. At the systemic level, such\ntreatment creates a social pattern of disadvantage that reduces the\ndisabled to second-class status. In those two respects, the grounds of\ncivil rights law are no different when it comes to the disabled.\n\nAnother way in which disability is thought to be different from race\nconcerns the special needs that the disabled often have that make life\nmore costly for them. These extra costs would exist even if the\nsocially-constructed physical environment were built to provide the\ndisabled with fair equality of opportunity and their basic civil and\npolitical liberties were secured. In order to function effectively,\ndisabled persons may need to buy medications or therapies or other\nforms of assistance that the able-bodied do not need for their\nfunctioning. And there does not seem to be any parallel in matters of\nrace to the special needs of some of those who are disabled. The\ndriving idea of the Civil Rights Movement was that blacks did not have\nany special needs: all they needed was to have the burdens of racism\nlifted from them and, once that was accomplished, they would flourish\nor fail like everyone else in society.\n\nHowever, Silvers (1998) argues that the parallel between race and\ndisability still holds: all the disabled may claim from society as a\nmatter of justice is that they have fair equality of opportunity and\nthe same basic civil rights as everyone else. Any special needs that\nthe disabled may have do not provide the grounds of any legitimate\nclaims of justice. On the other hand, Kittay (2000) argues that the\nspecial needs of the disabled are a matter of basic justice. She\nfocuses on the severely mentally disabled, for whom fair opportunity\nin the labor market and political rights in the public sphere will\nhave no significance, and on the families that have the responsibility\nof caring for the severely disabled. Pogge (2000) also questions\nSilvers\u2019 view, suggesting that it is implausible to deny that\njustice requires that society provide resources for meeting the needs\nof the severely disabled. Still, it may be the case that some version\nof Silvers\u2019 approach is justifiable when it comes to disabled\npersons who have the capacity \u201cto participate fully in the\npolitical and civic institutions of the society and, more broadly, in\nits public life\u201d (Pogge, 2000: 45). In the case of such persons,\nthe basic civil right to equal citizenship would require that they\nhave the equal opportunity to participate in such institutions,\nregardless of their disability. Although there may be some aspects of\nthe racial model that cannot be applied to persons with severe forms\nof mental disability, the principles behind the American civil rights\nstruggles of the 1950s and 60s remain crucial normative resources for\nunderstanding and combating forms of unjust discrimination that have\nonly more recently been addressed by philosophers and by society more\nbroadly.\n\nBarnes focuses on the category of physical disability and argues that\nthe conditions fitting under the category are \u201cstrikingly\nheterogenous\u201d (2016: 9 and 46) and that there is no feature\ncommon to the bodies of all (physically) disabled persons that makes\nthem disabled. On her account, disability is a socially-constructed\ncategory that \u201cpeople have found useful when organizing\nthemselves in a civil rights struggle\u201d and \u201cdisability\njust is whatever the disability rights movement is promoting\njustice for\u201d (43 \u2013 emphasis in original). Barnes adds that\nthe movement\u2019s judgments about which persons and conditions are\nincluded under its umbrella are not arbitrary but rather\n\u201crule-based\u201d and implicitly treat the category of\ndisability as a \u201ccluster-concept\u201d to be applied to\nphysical conditions that have \u201csome sufficient number of\nfeatures such as: being subject to social stigma and prejudice; being\nviewed as unusual or atypical; making ordinary daily tasks difficult\nor complicated; causing chronic pain; causing barriers to access\npublic places, \u2026 requiring the use of mobility aids or\nassistive technology [and] requiring medical care\u201d (45). What\nunifies the various conditions categorized as disabilities, in\nBarnes\u2019s view, is that they \u201care the kind of\nthing that the disability rights movement is trying to make the\nworld a better place to live with\u201d (48 \u2013 emphasis in\noriginal). To be clear, her view is not that the movement is\nrecognizing a \u201ckind of thing\u201d that would exist even in its\nabsence but that the movement creates the kind of thing we call\n\u201cdisability.\u201d Accordingly, if we ask about each of the\nconditions that fit under the category of physical disability,\n\u2018What does it have common with the other conditions in the\ncategory?, then Barnes thinks that the most illuminating answer is\nthat the disability rights movement is fighting for the just treatment\nof persons with that condition.\n\nNonetheless, it is difficult to see how Barnes\u2019s account can\nadequately explain why some stigmatized features, such as blindness\nand deafness, count as disabilities at the same time that others, such\nas dark skin and being Jewish, are not disabilities. Under Jim Crow,\ndark skin was stigmatized, atypical, made ordinary tasks (like getting\nmedical assistance or a bank loan) difficult, and caused barriers to\naccess public places (where \u201cwhites only\u201d signs were found\nat public parks, hospitals, bathrooms, and swimming pools). Yet, the\nCivil Rights Movement was not, even implicitly, a matter of\neliminating disadvantage based on disability, notwithstanding\nimportant parallels between race-based and disability-based\ndiscrimination (Lim 2018: 983\u201384).\nLegal Cases and Statutes\n\nAllen v.
