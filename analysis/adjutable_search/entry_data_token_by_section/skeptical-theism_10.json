    "main_text": "Noseeum Arguments || Cumulative Case Argument\n3.2 Cumulative Case Argument\n\nAn alternative argumentative strategy doesn\u2019t focus on\nindividual cases of evils that seem such that God\u2019s permission\nof them is unnecessary for an outweighing good. Rather, it focuses on\na larger class of such evils. One kind of argument that focuses on a\nlarger class of these evils is a cumulative case argument like\nthis:\n\nNoseeum\n\nN1.1\nEach individual seemingly unjustified evil is, on its own, slight\ndisconfirming evidence against theism.\nN1.2\nThere are many seemingly unjustified evils.\nN1.3\nTherefore, the collection of all seemingly unjustified evils is\nstrong evidence against theism.\nN1.4\nTherefore, theism is probably false.\n\n\n\nBut some skeptical theists object to N1.1\non general methodological grounds (see Perrine and Wykstra 2014:\n157\u2013163). Evidence of a specific type might disconfirm a\nhypothesis by eliminating some specific version of that hypothesis\nthat does not fit that type of evidence. But that evidence won\u2019t\ndisconfirm other specific versions of that hypothesis that do fit that\ntype of evidence. Thus, evidence of the same type might initially\ndisconfirm a hypothesis by eliminating specific versions of it; but\nthat type of evidence won\u2019t continue disconfirming that\nhypothesis, since the only remaining versions of the hypothesis\naccommodate that evidence. To give an example, the sun rises and sets\nevery day. This type of evidence disconfirms heliocentrism by\ndisconfirming a specific version of heliocentrism on which the earth\nrevolves around the sun while always facing the sun. But this type of\nevidence won\u2019t disconfirm other versions of heliocentrism on\nwhich the earth revolves around the sun, but regularly spins on an\naxis. Thus, the sun rising and setting each day might initially\ndisconfirm heliocentrism\u2014by eliminating some versions of\nheliocentrism\u2014but that type of evidence won\u2019t continue\ndisconfirming heliocentrism. For the remaining versions of\nheliocentrism fit that type of evidence.\n\nAnalogously, some skeptical theists might allow that the existence of\nsome seemingly unjustified evils disconfirms theism. Insofar as they\ndo disconfirm theism, it is by disconfirming specific versions of\ntheism on which God always explains, or indicates, the justifying\nreasons for the permission of evils. But the existence of seemingly\nunjustified evils won\u2019t disconfirm versions of theism on which\nGod\u2019s justifying reasons for permitting suffering are\nfrequently, even normally, beyond our ken. Thus, this type of\nevidence\u2014the existence of seemingly unjustified\nevils\u2014might disconfirm some versions of theism but won\u2019t\ndisconfirm other versions of theism. So, it won\u2019t be the case\nthat each seemingly unjustified evil is slight disconfirmation for\ntheism in general and N1.1 is false.\n",
