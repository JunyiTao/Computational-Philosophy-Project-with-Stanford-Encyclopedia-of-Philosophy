    "main_text": "Framing themes: circumscribing the topic || Africanaity\n1.1 Africanaity\n\nThe first theme has to do with the threshold metaphysical and\nsocio-anthropological assumptions that underwrite the use of\n\u201cAfricana\u201d as a modifier. Things that earn this\nmodifier\u2014people and practices most clearly, institutions and\nmaterial objects somewhat less so\u2014are supposed to be\ninterestingly connected to the continent of Africa and, therefore, to\neach other. This raises obvious questions. What kind of connections\ncount for this purpose? How strong do they have to be?\n\nArguments about how to account for the unity of the Africana condition\ncomprise one of the recurring subjects of Africana philosophy. This\nhas often taken the form of debates about \u201cAfricanity,\u201d\nthe key contours of which have been helpfully chronicled by Souleymane\nBachir Diagne\n (2001).[1]\n Unfortunately, that concept is ambiguous between studies of African\ncommonalities\u2014of what, say, Ghanaians and Eritreans share that\nBritons of African descent may not\u2014and studies of African\ndiasporic continuities. In deference to the distinctiveness of the\nconcerns animating these studies and of the conclusions they often\nreach, I will reserve the notion of Africanity for studies focused on\nthe continent and introduce the notion of Africanaity to\nindicate an interest in wider diasporic connections.\n\nThis is not the place to consider in detail the threshold questions of\nAfricanaity. Luckily it is a fairly intuitive concept, rooted in\nwidely\u2014if often dimly\u2014understood facts about the social\nand political history of Africa and its peoples over the last several\ncenturies. One can debate the precise meaning of these facts or the\nlimits of the intuition underwriting the Africana idea. But the basic\nintuition, even for critics of its extended application in, say, a\nPan-African politics, is provisionally useful as what Lucius T. Outlaw\nJr. calls a \u201cgathering notion,\u201d used to capture the same\ninsight that underwrites locutions like \u201cof African\ndescent,\u201d and to prepare that insight for extension, critique,\nand elaboration (Outlaw 2004, 90).\n",
