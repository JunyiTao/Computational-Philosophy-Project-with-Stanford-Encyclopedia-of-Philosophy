Insofar as this seems right, there is reason to try out a\ntheory of desire according to which dispositions to pleasure (and\ndispleasure) are all there is to desire. Perhaps desires only\ncontingently move us to action, but necessarily give rise to certain\nfeelings. A simple version of this theory holds:\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for the organism to be\n  disposed to take pleasure in it seeming that p and displeasure\n  in it seeming that not-p.\n\n  \n\n\nIn addition to considerations in moral psychology, there are also\nreasons to prefer a pleasure-based theory of desire that stem from the\nphilosophy of mind. Galen Strawson defends a pleasure-based theory on\ntwo grounds: first, Strawson holds that being a desire for\nanything (or being a belief about anything or otherwise\nexhibiting intentionality) requires consciousness, and pleasure and\ndispleasure are the states of consciousness most closely linked to\ndesire. And second, Strawson holds that it is conceivable that there be\ncreatures who would lack dispositions to act but who would have\ndispositions to feelings of pleasure and displeasure, and that these\ncreatures would seem to have desires for the things that would please\nthem. These creatures might include actual human beings suffering from\nneurological injuries removing their dispositions to act, and they\nmight include purely imaginary beings never born with capacities to\nact, just capacities to feel (Strawson 1994).\n\n\nCarolyn Morillo has also defended a pleasure-based theory of desire,\nthough on quite different grounds. Beginning on conceptual grounds,\nMorillo argues that desires are ontologically independent of action,\nbecause they are non-trivial explainers of action. And then on\nempirical (specifically, neuroscientific) grounds, Morillo argues that\nepisodes of pleasure are identical to certain neural events (the\nrelease of dopamine by what is known as the \u2018reward\nsystem\u2019), and these same neural events are the causal origin (in\nconjunction with belief) of action. Thus, episodes of pleasure play the\nrole of desires, and so desires are episodes of pleasure (Morillo\n1990).\n\n\nA difficulty for pleasure-based theories of desire is that pleasure\nhas seemed to some to have a causal or representational relationship to\ndesire. According to these philosophers, net satisfaction of desire, or\nnet increase in satisfaction of desire, is the standard cause of\npleasure, and the pleasure caused perhaps represents this change in\ndesire satisfaction. If such views are correct, then it seems desires\nmust be ontologically distinct from pleasure in the way that causes are\ndistinct from their effects, or objects of representation from their\nrepresentations (Davis 1982; Schroeder 2004).\n",
