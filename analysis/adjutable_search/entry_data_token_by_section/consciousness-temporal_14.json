    "main_text": "Extensional Approaches || More Recent Defences and Discussions\n5.2 More Recent Defences and Discussions\n5.2.1 Awareness, Simplicity and Overlap\n\nJohn Foster has defended an overlap-version of the extensional view on\na number of occasions. Foster has no doubt that temporally extended\nphenomena are an important feature of our ordinary experience,\nobserving that\n\n\nduration and change through time seem to be presented to us with the\nsame phenomenal immediacy as homogeneity and variation of colour\nthrough space. (Foster 1982: 255)\n\n\nFoster begins his discussion by assuming an awareness-content model of\nconsciousness. Let\u2019s suppose a musical scale is being sung, and\nthe duration of the notes is such that a listening subject is aware of\nthree notes in succession. As the scale unfolds the subject will have\na succession of auditory experiences\n\nE1 = [do-re-mi],\nE2 = [re-mi-so],\nE3 = [mi-so-fa]\n\n\nand so on. This sequence of experiences has a puzzling feature: it\nlooks as though the notes are being experienced more than once, with\nre featuring in E1and E2, mi in E1, E2 and E3, and\nso in E2 and E3. Experiences like this are not logically\nimpossible, Foster suggests, but our ordinary experience of listening\nto a series of notes obviously doesn\u2019t include repetitions of\nthis sort.\n\nFoster proposes a solution:\n\n\na presentation of a temporal pattern is itself temporally extended,\nand it overlaps its predecessor and successor in, so to speak,\npresentational substance to the extent that its pattern overlaps\ntheirs in phenomenal content. It is this double overlap which provides\nthe key to the sensible continuity of sense experience and unifies\npresentations into a stream of awareness. (Foster 1979: 176)\n\n\nEach of the two horizontal brackets in\n Figure 5.1\n represents an act of awareness that is temporally extended and\nunified; each of these extended acts produces a specious present, the\nfirst consisting of the experiencing of do-re and the second\nre-mi. Unrealistic repetitions are avoided by virtue of the\nfact that the extended acts overlap by sharing a common part.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 Foster\u2019s double overlap\ntheory featuring temporally extended awareness and contents. [An\n extended description of Figure 5.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn his Stream of Consciousness (2000, second edition 2006)\nBarry Dainton sets himself the goal of providing a phenomenological\naccount of the sort of unity and continuity we find in our ordinary\nstreams of consciousness. Dainton does not take any stand on the\nrelationship between the experiential and the physical, other than to\nassume that consciousness is \u201can irreducible ingredient of\nreality in its own right\u201d (2000 [2006: xiv]). He also adopts an\nindirect realist or \u201cprojectivist\u201d view of perceptual\nexperience.\n\nDainton\u2019s initial focus is on the synchronic (at-a-time) unity\nof consciousness. He argues that the togetherness of the\ndiverse experiences we are having at any one time is itself a feature\nour experience, and after considering attempts to explain\nco-consciousness in other terms Dainton concludes that it should be\nregarded as a primitive relationship. Among the rejected accounts of\nphenomenal unity is the thesis that experiential objects and contents\nare unified by virtue of falling under a single act of awareness. The\nidea that consciousness has an awareness-content structure\u2014as\nassumed by Foster\u2014is an appealing one in several respects, but\non closer examination all forms of this \u201cA-thesis\u201d turn\nout to be seriously flawed, or so Dainton argues. By way of an\nalternative Dainton adopts a one-level view of the structure of\nconsciousness he calls the \u201csimple conception\u201d:\n\n\nThe A-theorist tried to keep awareness distinct from content, but\nsince this turned out to be a mistake we must accept that awareness\nand content are not distinct ingredients within experience. It follows\nthat consciousness is inseparable from phenomenal contents: when a\ngiven phenomenal item comes into being it comes into being as a\nconscious experience \u2026 contents are themselves intrinsically\nconscious, and hence\u2014in a manner of speaking\u2014they are\nself-revealing or self-intimating. (Dainton 2000: 57)\n\n\nIn the chapters of Stream of Consciousness devoted to\ntemporal experience Dainton argues that a number of existing\napproaches face serious problems. These include memory theories in\nvarious guises, pulse-theories, Broad\u2019s extended content model\nand Husserl\u2019s version of retentionalism. Dainton concludes that\nthe \u201coverlap\u201d form of the extensional theory defended by\nRussell and Foster has significant advantages over the alternatives,\nand is worthy of further development. Amongst its other virtues it\noffers a plausible explanation of the way consciousness can be\nexperienced as deeply continuous for hours at a stretch, something\nrival approaches fail to provide.\n\nFor Dainton the earlier and later contents of an individual specious\npresent form a single unified experience by virtue of being\nexperienced together. Dainton argues experiences can be unified over\ntime in the same primitive way as experiences at a time, and so the\nearlier and later contents within a single specious present can be\nco-conscious, but diachronically rather than synchronically. There are\nhowever, differences between the synchronic and diachronic forms of\nco-consciousness. It is natural to think that synchronic phenomenal\nunity is transitive, but as Russell and Foster noted, in the\ndiachronic case failures of transitivity are ubiquitous, and can occur\nwhenever two specious presents partially overlap. Dainton (2000 [2006:\nchapters 8 and 9]) argues that co-consciousness in its synchronic and\ndiachronic forms connects experiences so profoundly that a form of\nholism ensues, and since specious presents consist of experiential\nparts connected by co-consciousness this form of holism extends to\nthem.\n\nDainton\u2019s account of individual specious presents has one\nfurther ingredient. Dainton takes consciousness to be dynamic in a\nstrong way: he holds that our experiences typically exhibit a\n\u201cdiscernible phenomenal flow \u2026 a sense that the\nsame kind of phenomenal quality is being continuously renewed\u201d\n(2004a: 15). It is difficult to see how this feature of our experience\ncould be explained by the co-consciousness relationship alone, since\nthe latter is a symmetrical relationship: if do is\nco-conscious with re then re will be co-conscious\nwith do. Given this symmetry, how is it that we\ndo-flowing-into-re? It is at this point that Dainton\nintroduces an additional ingredient: phenomenal contents\n\n\nwhich are symmetrically joined by co-consciousness themselves possess\nan inherent directional dynamism. The C-tone is not a static auditory\nquality, but a flowing quality, likewise for D and E. This\nimmanent flow is an essential ingredient of any auditory\ncontent, just as essential as timbre, pitch or volume. (2004a: 23)\n\n\nIn\n Figure 5.2\n this dynamic flow is represented by horizontal arrows, and the upper\nand lower brackets represent the span of diachronic\nco-consciousness.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 Dainton's Simple Overlap\nModel. [An\n extended description of Figure 5.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn \u201cSensing Change\u201d (2008a) Dainton introduces the\n\u201cextensional model\u201d as the doctrine that individual\nspecious presents consist of \u201ctemporally extended episodes of\nexperience that are apprehended as wholes\u201d. Dainton also\nresponds to Grush\u2019s claim that the extensional model is\nincapable of accommodating temporal illusions such as the\nphi-phenomenon in a plausible manner: one way of making sense of the\nillusions is to suppose that our brains take some time before deciding\non an interpretation of incoming stimuli. In response Grush (2017)\noffers several criticisms of this \u201cdelayed\nextensionalism\u201d, and argues that the envisaged processing delay\nwould be more problematic than Dainton realizes. Arstila (2016a)\nargues that the approaches defended by Grush and Dainton are both\nproblematic, and offers his own alternative account of apparent\nmotion.\n\nOn a different theme, Dainton (2014) focuses on various issues related\nto the temporal structure of consciousness on the smallest of scales,\nand he defends the view that our streams of consciousness are\n\u201cessentially extended continua\u201d whose smallest parts have\nsome finite temporal extension. By virtue of not being composed of\nstrictly momentary parts a challenge to extensionalism by Pelczar\n(2010a, 2010b) can be met, or so Dainton proposes.\n\nSome of Dainton\u2019s criticisms of alternative approaches have\nthemselves come under critical fire. Gallagher (2003) argues that many\nof Dainton\u2019s criticisms of Husserl are ineffective if Husserl is\nconstrued in the right sort of way\u2014Dainton (2003) responds. Dan\nZahavi finds that Dainton\u2019s analysis of the structure of streams\nof consciousness has many virtues (2007: 470) but is also problematic\nin several respects. Zahavi is also inclined to view experiences as\nintrinsically conscious, but argues that Dainton\u2019s simple\nconception of consciousness goes too far and in the end is too\nsimplistic. He is unimpressed by Dainton\u2019s claim that Husserl\nsimply stipulates that retentions have the mysterious features they\nneed in order to make his theory work, pointing out that Dainton\nhimself takes co-consciousness to be a primitive feature, one that\ncannot be analysed or reduced to anything else \u201cand if he can\nemploy that kind of argument, I fail to see why Husserl can\u2019t as\nwell\u201d (Zahavi 2007: 468).\n\nProsser finds the notion of co-consciousness that Dainton takes to be\nprimitive phenomenological feature \u201cquite mysterious\u201d\n(2016: 147) and so unhelpful:\n\n\nI can only say that in my own case I am not at all certain what it\nshould be like for two of my experiences to be co-conscious and yet\nnot occur at the same time without this simply being a case of the\nearlier experience being retained in a short-term memory. (2016:\n147)\n\n\nComing from a similar direction Chuard (2017: 127\u20138) suggests\nthat since snapshot theorists can accommodate the seemingly flow-like\ncharacter of experience there is no need for the theoretical apparatus\nDainton\u2019s approach requires.\n\nRashbrook (2013c) finds Dainton\u2019s claim that synchronic and\ndiachronic co-consciousness are different forms of the same kind of\nbasic relation problematic for a different reason. If Dainton is right\nin claiming that co-consciousness is primitive then \u201cthe only\nfeatures of the relation that we can describe are its logical\nproperties\u201d (2013c: 479), and these differ. Doesn\u2019t the\nfact that synchronic co-consciousness is transitive and diachronic\nco-consciousness non-transitive mean we are dealing with two relations\nhere, rather than one? There is a tension in Dainton\u2019s\nposition\u2014as Bayne (2001: 85) also notes\u2014but the situation\nmay not be as clear-cut as Rashbrook suggests. Co-consciousness may be\na basic relation but this does not mean that our knowledge of its\nnature is confined to its logical properties. We are also\u2014or so\nDainton claims\u2014acquainted with its phenomenological character:\nco-consciousness is simply a label for experienced togetherness, a\nmode of unity which can be found binding simultaneous and also\nsuccessive contents in our streams of\n consciousness.[18]\n5.2.2 Temporal Structures and Transparency\n\nIn a number of provocative contributions Ian Phillips has argued that\nmuch of the temporal experience debate has rested on confusions and\nerroneous assumptions, which leads Phillips to call for a fresh start.\nThe main target of Phillips (2010) is the Principle of Simultaneous\nAwareness (PSA), the doctrine that \u201cif one experiences\nsuccession or temporal structure at all, then one experiences it at a\nmoment\u201d (2010: 177). Phillips suggests that this doctrine\nunderlies both the various memory theories found in the literature,\nand specious present theories along the lines of Broad\u2019s (see\n \u00a76.1\n below). Phillips argues that PSA is false. If it were true then it\nwould be possible for the structure of our experience and the temporal\nstructure of the objects and events presented to us in our experience\nto differ. But Phillips argues that this is in fact impossible.\n\nPhillips\u2019 argument for this controversial claim rests on two key\nclaims. One is \u201cSeems implies Is\u201d, experience cannot be\nsystematically misleading as to its own nature, and hence\n\n\nwe cannot make sense of the idea that experience seems to one\u2019s\nrational introspective reflection to possess a certain temporal\nordering, when it is not in fact so ordered. (2010: 183)\n\n\nThe other key claim is that the temporal aspects of our experience are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d in a distinctive way:\n\n\none\u2019s only way of making rational judgments about the temporal\nstructure of experience itself, at least through reflection on\none\u2019s experience alone, is by taking the temporal structure of\nthe experience to map the temporal structure of the world as it is\nexperienced as being. (2010: 184)\n\n\nIf experience is transparent in this manner then we will judge that an\nexperience of a succession of notes will itself unfold over time in\njust the way the notes seem to. If the \u201cSeems implies Is\u201d\nprinciple is also correct then it is impossible for the temporal\nproperties of experience and its objects to systematically diverge in\nthe way PSA predicts.\n\nIn \u201cThe Temporal Structure of Experience\u201d (2014c) Phillips\nsets out to defend what he calls the \u201cna\u00efve view\u201d of\nthe manner in which the temporal structure of experience and the\ntemporal structure of the objects of experience are related.\n\n\n\u2026 when all goes well, your stream of consciousness inherits the\ntemporal structure of the events that are its contents. You\n\u201ctake in\u201d the temporal structure of the events you witness\nin witnessing them. As a result, the temporal structure of experience\nmatches the temporal structure of its objects. In cases of illusion,\nit is as if this is so. Thus, in every case, the temporal structure of\nexperience matches the apparent temporal structure of the objects of\nexperience. (Phillips 2014c: \u00a77.1)\n\n\nPhillips suggests na\u00efvet\u00e9 applies for temporal properties\nsuch as simultaneity, successiveness, relative duration and temporal\norder. Phillips goes on to address an objection. The claim that\nexperience is transparent is also commonly made by proponents of the\nrepresentationalist view of perception. Representationalists such as\nMichael Tye maintain that perceptual experience is entirely\ndiaphanous, and hence that we have no introspective access to it, only\nto the objects in the world that it reveals. If this conception of\ntransparency is correct, Phillips\u2019 claim that we have\nintrospective access to the temporal properties of our experience must\nbe wrong. In response Phillips points out when it comes to experience,\ntime is special. It may well be correct to reject the idea that an\nexperience of redness or squareness is itself red or square. But\n\n\nour experiential encounter with time is quite unlike color or shape,\nsince our experience is not just of time, but also manifestly in time.\n(2014c: 144)\n\n\nFor critical assessments of these views see Lee (2014a), Frischhut\n(2015) and Viera (2019).\n\nPhillips also makes a claim about what the extensional theory of\ntemporal experience really amounts to. Following Soteriou\u2019s lead\nhere, for Phillips the key and defining feature of extensionalism is\nnot simply a claim that an experience of change or succession\ntakes place over an extended period. It is that when it comes to\nexperience \u201cit is significant stretches, not instants, that are\nexplanatorily and metaphysically fundamental\u201d (2014c:149).\n\nA number of theorists have argued that Phillips\u2019 inheritance\nthesis\u2014that for any temporal property apparently presented in\nexperience our experience itself possesses that temporal\nproperty\u2014is undermined by one or other temporal illusions.\nPhillips disagrees, and in a series of papers devoted to different\nillusions he finds ways of reconciling his na\u00efvet\u00e9 with\nthe allegedly problematic experimental findings. Several of the latter\ncentre on postdiction, the well-established phenomenon when what we\nexperience as occurring at a time t is influenced by sensory\nstimuli occurring later than t. Phillips argues (2014c:\n\u00a77.7\u20137.8) that provided we recognize that episodes of\nexperience extending over several hundred milliseconds are\nmetaphysically basic postdiction ceases to be deeply puzzling, for\nthere is no reason to assume happenings later than t are\nirrelevant to what we experience at t. In Phillips (2014a)\nthe focus is on whether the so-called \u201cmotion-silencing\u201d\nillusion poses a threat to na\u00efvet\u00e9, as some have argued\n(for example, Suchow & Alvarez 2011; Watzl 2013). The illusion\nfeatures a ring of coloured dots which are seen to cease to changing\ncolour when they start rotating. Phillips argues that rather it is\nbest construed as a instance of change-blindness, rather than as a\nfailure of inheritance. In \u201cPerceiving and the Passage of\nTime\u201d (2013) Phillips deals with the challenges posed by the\npassage of time apparently speeding up reported by the survivors of\nlife-threatening dangers, along with other duration distortions\nincluding the \u201codd-ball effect\u201d. Phillips (2014b) provides\na useful overview of his own work on temporal illusions.\n\nMatthew Soteriou\u2019s stance on a number of issues runs parallel to\nPhillips\u2019. Soteriou also thinks that our perceptual experiences\nare in certain important respects transparent. In ordinary perceiving\nwe seem to be directly aware not only of external worldly objects but\nalso of events which are extended through time, and we do not seem to\nbe aware of mental items such as sense-data. But he also thinks that\nin ordinary perception we have an awareness of temporal aspects of our\nexperiences.\n\n\nIntrospectively, it doesn\u2019t seem to one as though one can mark\nout the temporal location of one\u2019s perceptual experience as\ndistinct from the temporal location of whatever it is that one seems\nto be perceptually aware of. Furthermore, it seems to one as though\nthe temporal location of one\u2019s experience depends on, and is\ndetermined by, the temporal location of whatever it is that\none\u2019s experience is an experience of. (Soteriou 2013: 89f.)\n\n\nIf Soteriou is right, introspection can reveal the temporal properties\nof not only the events we perceive, but also of the perceptual\nexperiences that are revealing these events, and the events and\nexperiences seem to have the same duration. Introspection can thus\nprovide evidence that our temporal experiences are themselves\ntemporally extended, given that we directly experience change and\nsuccession\u2014in line with extensionalism. See Hoerl (2018) for\nsome further discussion.\n\nAmong writers on temporal experience Soteriou is distinctive in the\nemphasis he places on ontological issues, with different\ntypes of mental states\u2014when their nature is properly\nunderstood\u2014having quite different relationships with time. As\nSoteriou makes clear, his own thinking on these questions has been\nstrongly influenced by Brian O\u2019Shaughnessy. The latter\nintroduces his own position in Consciousness and the World\nthus:\n\n\nYet even when experience is not changing in type or content, it still\nchanges in another respect: it is constantly renewed, a new\nsector of itself is there and then taking place. \u2026 In\nshort, the domain of experience is essentially a domain of\noccurrences, or processes and events. (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000:\n42\u201343)\n\n\nIn developing his own position Soteriou draws a distinction between\nmental states and occurrent mental processes, with a distinguishing\nfeature of the latter being the way they unfold over time\nwhereas states don\u2019t. For Soteriou (2007: 551\u201355) the\nbasic units of temporal experience are temporally extended rather than\nmomentary:\n\n\nThe answer we give to the question of what state a subject is in at a\ntime is determined by the answer we give to the question of what state\nthe subject is in during an interval of time that includes that\ninstant\u2026. (2007: 554)\n\n\nSoteriou defends a version of direct realism (or relationalism) in\nwhich perceptual states are occurrent processes which are accompanied\nby representational states which exist in virtue of perceptual\nprocesses, and which wouldn\u2019t otherwise exist. Soteriou\nargues\u2014here following in Geach\u2019s footsteps\u2014that\nthought-like mental representations do not unfold over time in the way\nperceptual forms of consciousness do, a fact which seriously\nundermines the representationalist theories of perception in several\nof its guises. For more on these themes see Soteriou (2007, 2010,\n2013, 2018).\n\nOliver Rashbrook has put Soteriou\u2019s process-state distinction to\nuseful work, showing that it can help dispel confusions surrounding\nthe idea that consciousness is continuous (Rashbrook 2013b) and also\nhelp meet Pelczar\u2019s challenge to extensional approaches\n(Rashbrook 2013a). In a more critical vein see Rodr\u00edguez (2016)\nand Steward (2018).\n5.2.3 Tense, Perception and Unity\n\nIn his \u201cTime and Tense in Perceptual Experience\u201d (2009)\nChristof Hoerl also defends a form of extensionalism, albeit under the\nguise of \u201cmolecularism\u201d. For Hoerl this approach can only\nhope to be viable if it is formulated in tenseless rather than tensed\nterms. Although specious present theorists have often assumed that\ntemporal experience is best characterized in tensed terms such as\n\u201cpast\u201d, \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d,\nHoerl argues that in the extensionalist framework it is tenseless\nnotions such as \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d that are\nrequired. When hearing an auditory succession consisting of a\nwhizz-bang we don\u2019t first experience the whizz as present and\nthen (shortly after) as past-seeming:\n\n\nmy experience is rather as of each sound occurring in turn, and my\nexperience\u2019s taking this course is what constitutes my being\naware of the whizz being followed by the bang. (Hoerl 2009: 8)\n\n\nIn a later article Hoerl (2013b) suggests here that currently the two\nmost promising approaches to temporal experience are extensionalism on\nthe one hand, and representationalist variants of retentionalism. He\nalso suggests\u2014also see Hoerl (2017)\u2014that the\nextensionalist view of temporal experience and the direct realist (or\n\u201crelationalist\u201d) account of perception are natural\npartners. The representationalist stance on perceptual experience can\nassist the retentionalist in a number of ways, as we saw in\n \u00a74.4.\n Hoerl is also right that anyone who adopts a realist stance with\nrespect to temporal experience and who also inclines to direct realism\nwill find the extensional view a natural and appealing one. If I see a\ntraffic light change colour then for a direct realist an object\nundergoing change over an interval of time is being directly presented\nto me, and the resulting perceptual experience will itself extend\nthrough time, just as extensionalists claim. However, on the face of\nit the extensional approach seems compatible with other views\nconcerning the nature of perceptual experience, such as the indirect\nrealism Dainton prefers one, or adverbialism to mention but\ntwo\u2014see Crane and French (2015 [2021]) for an overview of the\ncompeting theories.\n\nThe form of extensionalism defended by Hoerl is distinctive in a\nfurther way. As Hoerl notes (2013b: \u00a76), to account for the\ndifference between a succession of experiences and an experience of\nsuccession it is commonly argued that the latter possess a distinctive\nkind of unity that is absent from the former. Dainton, for\nexample, holds that contents occurring at different times are only\nexperienced as successive if they are bound together by his diachronic\nco-consciousness relationship. Hoerl argues that this assumption is in\nfact misguided, and that if we embrace extensionalism there is no need\nto appeal to this or any other unifying relation. In explaining how an\nexperience of succession differs from a succession of experiences the\nonly factor extensionalist needs to appeal to is the limited temporal\nspan of our temporal awareness. Hoerl suggests that Dainton\u2019s\nappeal to the non-transitivity of co-consciousness amounts to nothing\nmore than\n\n\nanother way of stating the intuition behind the individuation argument\nthat the maximum duration that individual temporal experiences can\nspan is limited. (Hoerl 2013b: 406)\n\n\nIt is not obvious that extensionalists can dispense with the services\nof a diachronic unity relationship. Let\u2019s consider things from\nthe vantage point of Hoerl\u2019s favoured combination of\nextensionalism and direct realism. Direct realists hold that\n(veridical) perception involves two elements: an external\nmind-independent object and an act or episode of perceptual\nawareness\u2014a perceptual experience occurs when our awareness\nacquaints us with an outer object. In the synchronic case: it is\nwidely (if not universally) agreed that phenomenal unity is a real and\nimportant phenomenon. My current visual and auditory experiences are\nunified in a distinctive way, whereas my current visual experiences\nand your current auditory experiences are not.\n\nSynchronic phenomenal unity can be accounted for in different\nways\u2014see Brook and Raymont (2017 [2021]) for further details.\nOne option is to hold that there is a unity relation which joins\nexperiences together. A second option is to say that experiences are\nunified by virtue of being subsumed in a more encompassing experience.\nA further option is to hold that experiential contents are unified\nwhen they fall under a single act of awareness. The latter option will\nbe a natural one for direct realists, given their view of the role\nawareness plays in ordinary perception. Direct realists who take this\nstance on synchronic unity are, in effect, getting an account of\nsynchronic unity for free\u2014it follows from a prior theoretical\ncommitment to a certain view of perception. But it remains the case\nthat the contents at any given time in a typical stream of\nconsciousness are unified in a distinctive way.\n\nThe same applies in the diachronic case. Anyone who combines the\nextensional view with direct realism will presumably hold that our\ntemporal experience relies on acts of awareness which are themselves\ntemporally extended. But as in the synchronic case, the contents that\nfall under these acts of awareness will be unified in a distinctive\nway: their successive parts are experienced together rather\nthan separately. When Hoerl talks of \u201cindividual\nexperiences\u201d it is presumably unified ensembles of this kind to\nwhich he is referring. Phenomenal unity has not departed from the\nscene, it is merely being explicated in a different way.\n\nMoreover, phenomenal unity is not confined to the contents of\nexperience, it will also exist at the level of acts of awareness. In\nthe synchronic case, if consciousness has an awareness-content\nstructure all contents have to do in order to be phenomenally unified\nis to fall under a single awareness at a give time. In the diachronic\ncase the situation is not so straightforward. An act of awareness\nwhich extends across an interval of time will be composed of different\nphases, and unless the successive phases of the extended acts of\nawareness are themselves experienced together\u2014in the manner\ndepicted in\n Figure 5.1\n above\u2014we won\u2019t have experiences of succession.\n\nTo make matters more concrete let us focus on a temporally extended\nepisode of awareness A, which has sufficient temporal\nextension to encompass a traffic light\u2019s changing from red to\ngreen, but which does not stretch any further into the past or future.\nWe can represent this state of affairs schematically thus:\nA[red, green]. Let\u2019s now narrow our focus and\nconsider two briefer sub-phases of this experience:\nA[red] and A[green] corresponding to\nthe earlier and later phases of the experience we are considering.\nUnless the earlier and later phases of A are\nphenomenally unified our subject\u2019s stream of consciousness\nconsists of two entirely discrete experiences: A[red]\nand A[green] experienced in succession but not\nas a succession. In order for our subject to have a single\nexperience\u2014an experience of succession rather than a\nsuccession of experiences\u2014it has to be the case that the red and\ngreen lights are experienced together rather than separately. Adopting\na direct realist conception of perception doesn\u2019t eliminate the\nneed for a mental unity relation, it merely gets re-located or\nre-described. Or so a critic might object.\n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to extensional specious\npresents see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues.\n6. Hybrid Approaches\n6.1 Extended Contents and Momentary Acts\n\nGiven that the retentional and extensional approaches continue to have\ntheir defenders a not unreasonable conclusion to draw is that both may\ncontain an element of the truth so far as the nature and structure of\ntemporal consciousness is concerned. Given this it is not surprising\nto find a number of writers proposing hybrid models\nwhich\u2014in differing ways\u2014contain elements of both.\n\nIn his Scientific Thought (1923) C.D. Broad writes:\n\n\nThere is no doubt that sensible motion and rest are genuine\nunanalysable properties of visual sensa. I am aware of them as\ndirectly as I am aware of the redness of a red patch (1923: 287)\n\n\na clear commitment to realism. Later in the same work, in a much-cited\npassage he elaborates thus:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a notorious fact that we do not merely notice that\nsomething has moved or otherwise changed; we also often see\nsomething moving or changing. This happens if we\nlook at the second-hand of a watch or look at a flickering flame.\nThese are experiences of a quite unique kind; we could no more\ndescribe what we sense in them to a man who had never had such\nexperiences than we could describe a red colour to a man born blind.\n(1923: 351)\n\n\nThe account of the structure of temporal consciousness Broad went on\nto develop in Scientific Thought is of a distinctive kind. It\nis built on acts of awareness that are themselves momentary but which\napprehend contents distributed over a short interval of time. For\nBroad a stream of consciousness consists of dense sequences of\nmomentary acts and extended contents, with the consequence that the\ncontents apprehended by neighbouring acts largely overlap. For anyone\nwho holds that consciousness has an awareness-content structure\nBroad\u2019s basic approach may well look quite promising\u2014and\nmany direct realists as well as sense-datum theorists fall into this\ncategory. The sort of overlap Broad envisages is shown in\n Figure 6.1,\n where three momentary acts A1, A2, and A3 apprehend a succession of\nauditory tones C-D-E-F, with each act able to apprehend two adjoining\ntones.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 C.D. Broad's Theory. [An\n extended description of Figure 6.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBroad\u2019s theory has its merits, but it also gives rise to some\nproblems and puzzles. Let\u2019s suppose that during the experiencing\nof the D-tone a brief flash of light is also experienced\u2014in\n Figure 6.2\n below the flash is represented by the asterisk shape. This flash\nfalls under A1, and so is experienced by that awareness; it also falls\nunder A2, and so is experienced by that awareness. Hence the problem:\nit looks as though the flash is experienced twice, when in reality it\nwould be experienced only once. In fact the situation is far worse,\nbecause in Broad\u2019s model there are many additional momentary\napprehensions occurring between A1 and A2, each creating a different\nexperience. As Mabbott puts it:\n\n\nNothing in my direct experience confirms this repetition. If it\noccurred it would obviously make listening to music or to continuous\nsentences a matter of the greatest complexity and difficulty. (Mabbott\n1951: 161)\n\n\nDainton (2000 [2006: 141]) also suggests that Broad\u2019s account is\nafflicted by a problem of \u201crepeated contents\u201d.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2 Repetitions and Divergences.\n[An\n extended description of Figure 6.2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nA further problem stems from the fact that on Broad\u2019s account\nthe periods during which we are continuously aware of contents can\nhave a greater temporal extension than the contents themselves.\nReturning to\n Figure 6.2\n the experience of the flash unfold over the very brief interval\ne shown in the diagram. The duration d stretches\nfrom A1 to A2 and corresponds to the entire period of time the subject\nwas aware of the flash. As can be seen the interval d is\nconsiderably longer than e. Since contents that are\napprehended by acts of awareness appear to be present, this means\nthat\u2014if Broad\u2019s account is correct\u2014brief events are\nexperienced as present for considerably longer periods than they\nactually are present. By allowing us to experience an interval in an\ninstant (or something close to it) Broad renders temporal experience\nincapable of accurately reflecting the temporal properties of the\nevents we perceive. If our experience were misleading in this\nsort of way it is difficult to believe we would not notice. For\nfurther discussion of these aspects of Broad\u2019s model see Dainton\n(2000 [2006: 6.2]), Tye (2003), Phillips (2010) and Rashbrook (2012,\n2017).\n6.2 Further Hybrid Variations\n\nOne way for extensionalists to embrace (after a fashion) the\nstructures elaborated by retentionalists is to agree that the latter\ndo exist, and do play a role in our cognition, but at an entirely sub-\nor pre-conscious level. On this view, retentions (and perhaps\nprotentions) exist, but in the guise of neural mechanisms and\nprocesses that do not directly feature in consciousness. Carlos\nMontemayor (2013; Montemayor & Wittmann 2017) has defended this\nposition. Montemayor proposes that we distinguish the \u201csensorial\npresent\u201d from \u201cthe phenomenal present\u201d. The\nsensorial present represents stimuli as simultaneous, whereas the\nphenomenal present has a temporal extension of around half a second up\nto three seconds. Montemayor goes on to argue that it is a mistake to\nthink the cinematic, retentional and extensional models are mutually\nincompatible. The cinematic and retentional models correspond to his\nsensorial present, and whereas the (extensional) phenomenal present is\nphenomenally conscious, the sensorial present is only\naccess-conscious in Ned Block\u2019s sense. Merino-Rajme\n(2017) is impressed by the ingenuity of this proposal, but raises\ndoubts as to whether it is compatible with Block\u2019s conception of\nwhat access-consciousness involves.\n\nThomas Sattig (2019c) suggested that in his Raum und Zeit\n(1915) Anton Marty defended a hybrid model in which both retentional\nand extensional elements figure in temporal experience. Marty\u2019s\nposition is certainly intriguing, but since it confines the experience\nof change to momentary phases of experience it ultimately seems more\nretentionalist than extensionalist in character.\n\nIn a recent paper Rick Grush (2016\n [Other Internet Resources])\n distinguishes two sorts of perceptual content: A-ish content\nis structured in terms of past, present and future whereas\nB-ish content is structured in terms of earlier than,\nsimultaneous and later than. Grush points out that in discussions of\ntemporal experience it is generally (if tacitly) assumed that the\ncharacter of temporal experience has the same character at all\ntemporal scales, over short intervals of time, medium intervals and\nlong intervals. But what if this is not the case? What if our\nexperience isn\u2019t scale invariant? Grush proposes that\nat the larger temporal scales of seconds or minutes it is very\nplausible to think that our experience is A-ish in character. If you\nare watching an Olympic sprint, at around the mid-point some of the\nrace still lies in the future, some of it is in the past, and some of\nit is happening now. But perhaps it is different at smaller sub-second\ntemporal scales, and this is what Grush proposes: our experience is\nA-ish down to the scale of 200 msec, but beneath that it is B-ish:\n\n\nNo point in this interval is singled out as a now bracketed by a past\nand future. Rather, within this interval events are represented as\nstanding in relations of earlier than, simultaneous\nwith, and later than. But at scales greater than this,\nthis B-ishly structured interval of 200 msec effectively\nbecomes the bulky now of A-ish experience.\n(Grush 2016\n [OIR]:\n 8)\n\n\nGrush argues that holding that contents possess a B-ish character over\nshort intervals helps circumvent an otherwise serious \u201csurplus\ncontent\u201d problem that Dainton (2000, 2008a) has directed against\nretentional models.\n\nGerardo Viera also argues for a hybrid approach in which extensional\nand retentional (or atomist) models both have important play, but\nwhere neither applies universally, to all forms of temporal\nexperience. The grounds for this claim are scientific:\n\n\nempirical evidence suggests that temporal experience is fragmented and\ncomposed of many dissociable capacities to perceive the temporal\nstructure of our world. (Viera 2019: 33)\n\n\nViera\u2019s starting point is the current state of play in\nneuroscientific investigations into how the brain manages to keep\ntrack of time. The long-dominant assumption that the brain relies on\nthe regular beating of a single master-clock has been steadily\nundermined. If the master-clock existed and its functioning were\ndisrupted by drugs or neural damage we would expect this disruption to\nhave a devastating global impact on an individual\u2019s time-related\nabilities, but Viera points out that there are no known cases of\nneural damage which completely eliminate a person\u2019s\nability to perceive time. Coming from the other direction the\nhypothesis that timing and time perception depends on a multiplicity\nof different neural mechanisms has plenty of empirical support. When\nrapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is applied to the\nfrontal cortex the result is impaired timing in the second range; when\nrTMS is applied to the cerebellum timing in the millisecond range is\nimpaired. Ingesting psylocibin has no effect on the ability to\nperceive at timescales of less than 2 seconds, but severely impairs\nperception at longer timescales.\n\nIf our brains use a multiplicity of very different neural mechanisms\nwhen dealing with time then it is possible that the extensional model\napplies to some forms of temporal experience and the retentional model\nto other forms, Viera argues that this may well be the case. When it\ncomes to accounting for temporal perception at the sub-second level\nfor individual sensory modalities so-called intrinsic timing\nmodels are currently influential, these rely on the dynamics of\ntemporally extended neural processes to encode time, rather than any\nexternal clock. By way of an analogy, think of the way a pattern of\nripples on a lake carries information about the time that has elapsed\nsince a pebble was dropped. Viera suggests that any experiences this\ntype of extended neural process produces will themselves be temporally\nextended in an extensionalist manner, with the mirroring constraint\nwill be satisfied: the temporal features of successive phases of the\nneural process and the successive phases of the experience will\ncorrespond exactly. However, extensionalists don\u2019t have it all\ntheir own way. In the case of cross-modal perceptual order judgements\nat the timescale of less than one second Viera points out that there\nare cases where mirroring conspicuously fails. Experiments show that\nif a short delay is introduced between a button-pressing and a flash\nof light the two events seem to be occurring closer together in time\nthan they in fact are\u2014in some cases the ordering of the stimuli\nseems to be entirely reversed (Viera 2019: 39\u201340).\n\nViera draws an ambitious conclusion from these results: since the\nmirroring constraint is violated\n\n\nwe have a counterexample to extensionalism, and therefore neither\natomism nor extensionalism can provide us with a general theory for\nhow the temporal contents of experience relate to the temporal\nstructure of experience. (2019: 41)\n\n\nIt would be more accurate to hold that the cross-modal temporal order\njudgement case presents a potential problem for extensionalists who\nare committed to a very strict form of mirroring. Viera\u2019s\nargument poses no threat to extensionalists who are prepared to\nacknowledge that mirroring may sometimes fail to hold at shorter\ntime-scales.\n\nOn a number of occasions Ian Phillips (2010, 2018) has suggested that\na different sort of hybrid theory may well be worth taking seriously.\nPhillips proposes that the extensional and retentional approaches have\nmore in common than has usually been realized: there are grounds for\nthinking that both essentially depend on a form of memory.\nThe kind of memory Phillips has in mind is not the sort we can call up\nhours, days or months after the event we are\nrecollecting\u2014critics of the Reid-type memory theories are right\nto point out that memories of this kind are too unlike perception to\nfigure in temporal experience. The relevant type of memory is what\nJames called primary or elementary:\n\n\nan object of primary memory \u2026 never was lost; its date was\nnever cut off in consciousness from that of the immediately present\nmoment. In fact it comes to us as belonging to the rearward portion of\nthe present space of time, and not to the genuine past. (James 1890:\n646\u20137)\n\n\nPhillips argues that primary memory properly understood, is perceptual\nin character, and so capable of playing a role in role in experiences\nof succession by providing us with a direct link to the immediate\npast. Phillips takes his \u201crefined memory theory\u201d to be a\nmemory-based version of extensionalism. But he also proposes that,\nproperly understood, Husserl\u2019s theory is very similar:\nHusserl\u2019s retentions are also constitutively connected to the\npast, and by virtue of that could not exist in a momentary episode of\nconsciousness lacking that connection to the past. Adopting this\nperspective, Phillips argues, sheds valuable light on the entire\nfield. For it suggests that the fundamental division is between those\nwho those who claim\n\n\nthat it is only because our experience is a process which\nunfolds in time that it can acquaint us with the temporal structure of\nreality as it does.\u2026 (Phillips 2018: 17)\n\n\nand those who deny this. Phillips proposes that if we view matters\nthus\n\n\n\u2026 theorists who we might initially conceive of as rivals,\nnamely extensionalists such as Dainton, and retentionalists such as\nHusserl and O\u2019Shaughnessy, do not obviously disagree on\nsubstance. (2018: 21)\n\n\nBy way of further elaboration Phillips suggests the relation of\nco-consciousness which Dainton invokes to unify earlier and later\nphases of experience can itself be viewed as involving a form of\nmemory.\n\nThe suggestion that Dainton\u2019s co-consciousness relation could\namount to a form of memory is an interesting issue for future\ndiscussion. That aside, Phillips\u2019 claim that there is a divide\nof a fundamental kind between those who hold that experiences of\nsuccession require a succession of experiences on the one hand, and\nthose who hold that experiences of succession do not require\na succession of experiences on the other, is very plausible.\n\nIn his discussion of Phillips\u2019 work Wolf (2021) finds much to\nrecommend, but suggests that in its current form it lacks a decisive\nadvantage over the more orthodox extensional and retentional\napproaches. The solution, Wolf suggests, is to move in a more\ndynamic\u2014more Bergsonian direction\u2014by finding a way of\nincorporating Bergson\u2019s seemingly (but not really) paradoxical\nclaim that \u201cduration is essentially a continuation of what no\nlonger exists into what does exist\u201d. Wolf suggests that once\nthis is done the result is a more appealing form of Bergsonian\nextensionalism that has greater plausibility than the competing\nversions, Phillips\u2019 included.\n7. Anti-Realisms\n\nPerhaps there is a more dramatic discrepancy between the actual\ncharacteristics of our experience, on the one hand, and our\nbeliefs about these characteristics on the other, than\nanything we have considered up to now. True, we do talk as though we\nsee things move (and more generally, perceive change), and doubtless\nthis talk reflects our beliefs, but perhaps our beliefs are simply\nwrong. Perhaps our immediate experience is in reality entirely\nmotion-free, and our streams of consciousness radically fragmented,\nbut since we do not believe our experience is like this, we do not\ntalk as though it is.\n\nA position along these lines has been advocated by Dennett. If asked\nwhether our typical visual fields are fully continuous, even when one\nof our eyes is closed, most of us are inclined to answer in the\naffirmative: when we look at (say) a white wall, we see an\nuninterrupted expanse of white. In such cases we are unable to detect\na beachball-sized fuzzy dark expanse lying just to one side of the\ncentral axis of vision. But the physiology of the eye suggests there\nshould be a \u201cblind spot\u201d at that location, corresponding\nto the region of the retina occupied by the optic nerve which is\ndevoid of light-sensitive cells. As for why we do not detect a blind\nregion in our visual field, the standard\u2014and on the face of it,\nplausible\u2014answer is that our visual systems engage in some\n\u201cperceptual interpolation\u201d or filling-in: our\nbrains extrapolate from the stimuli reaching the light-sensitive cells\nin the region of the retina immediately surrounding the blind-spot,\nand fabricate experience to fill the relevant region of the visual\nfield accordingly.\n\nDennett points out that there is alternative to this account. Rather\nthan \u201cmaking up\u201d experience in this manner, perhaps our\nbrains simply fail to notice that there is a lack of visual\ninformation deriving from the hole region: after all, an absence of\ninformation is not the same thing as information about an absence.\nNever having received information from this region, the brain simply\nworks on the assumption that nothing special is going on there:\n\n\nThe brain doesn\u2019t have to \u201cfill in\u201d for the blind\nspot, since the region in which the blind spot falls is already\nlabelled (e.g., \u201cplaid\u201d \u2026 \u201cmore of the\nsame\u201d). (1991: 335)\n\n\nIn effect, since we have a belief about what the blind region\ncontains\u2014typically, \u201cmore of the same\u201d\u2014why\nshould the brain go to the trouble of generating experience as well?\nDennett goes on to suggest that this treatment of spatial holes can\nplausibly be extended to temporal holes (gaps in the continuity of\nexperience) also. Our visual experience is constantly interrupted by\nour eyes darting about during saccades. We don\u2019t notice the\nresulting holes or gaps in our experience, but they don\u2019t need\nto be filled in because we\u2019re not designed to notice them. More\ngenerally:\n\n\nOne of the most striking features of consciousness is its\ndiscontinuity\u2014as revealed in the blind spot, and the\nsaccadic gaps, to take the simplest examples. The discontinuity of\nconsciousness is striking because of the apparent continuity\nof consciousness. (1991: 356)\n\n\nAlthough Dennett himself concentrates on explaining why we are\ninclined to describe our experience as continuous if it is really\ndiscontinuous, the approach can be extended to the immediate\nexperience of change, or so Chuard argues (2011: 17) Suppose the\n\u201csuccession of static snapshots\u201d conception of experience\nas proposed by the cinematic theorist is correct. Provided the\ncontents and temporal arrangement of these static snapshots are enough\nto convince our brains that we are perceiving motion and change, we\nwill inevitably believe that this is what we are perceiving,\nand hence describe our experience in such terms. Isn\u2019t\nthis all that we are required to explain? For Dennett and Chuard\nnothing further is needed.\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71.3\n it is possible to be a realist about the experience of change and\nsuccession but an anti-realist about the dynamic features that some\nrealists claim to be a pervasive feature of our experience. Thomas\nSattig falls into this camp. Sattig is a realist about the experience\nof change and succession:\n\n\n\u2026 I do not merely infer that the leave has moved, from\nmemories of previously experienced momentary leaf-states. I just\nsee that motion occurs. (Sattig 2019a: 275)\n\n\nSattig doesn\u2019t reject all forms of flow, and has\ndeveloped an account of it grounded in phenomenal\nreplacement:\n\n\n\u2026 I see that each momentary leaf-state is immediately replaced\nby another one like water flowing through a river bed, where each\nportion of water is immediately replaced by a new portion. (Sattig\n2019b: \u00a71)\n\n\nIn reducing the experience of motion to successions of momentary\nperceptions of objects at different locations he appreciates that some\nrealists will find that his account fails to do justice to the dynamic\nnature of phenomenal flow:\n\n\nPrimitivists about the phenomenal whoosh of flow will not\naccept this phenomenological analysis, nor will they accept any other\n\u2026 But I have yet to encounter an alternative phenomenological\ndescription that reaches substantially beyond the usual, opaque\nflow-metaphors. (2019b: \u00a74)\n\n\nOthers are still more sceptical, arguing that realists who believe in\nexperiential flow or passage are deluded about the character of their\nown experience: flow isn\u2019t a real feature of our experience, we\nmerely (and falsely) believe that it is. Hoerl (2014) adopts this\nline, arguing that it is a mistake to suppose that the experience of\nseeing a moving object involves anything more than seeing the object\nat a succession of different locations\u2014also see Braddon-Mitchell\n(2014). In a similar but more general vein K. Miller, Holcombe, and\nLatham (2020) suggest that we may well be inclined to attribute\ndynamic features to our experience which it in fact lacks, and propose\ntwo cognitive mechanisms which may underlie this inclination.\n8. Temporal Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Time\n8.1 Competing Conceptions of Time\n\nIf there are very different accounts of the nature of temporal\nexperience, the same applies to time itself\u2014the time which\nexists in the wider physical universe, rather than time confined to\nhuman consciousness. Let us take a brief look at these differing\nconceptions before considering the complex issue of how universe-time\nand experienced-time are related.\n\nOne central issue concerning universe-time can be encapsulated is this\nsimple question: \u201cDoes time pass?\u201d Temporal passage can be\ncharacterized in a number of ways, but at the very least passage is\nassociated with the idea that the present is metaphysically privileged\nand steadily advancing, and this advance entails that future times\nwill become present, that present times and events will become past,\nand that past times become ever more past with every passing\nmoment. But while few deny that time seems to pass\u2014and indeed,\nthat this passage is (along with dimensionality) the most obvious\ndifference between time and space\u2014there are many who have denied\nthat time really does pass. Of these a few share\nMcTaggart\u2019s view that time cannot pass because time does not\nexist.\n\nA more popular view, these days at least, is the view that while time\ncertainly exists, it is more akin to space than it superficially\nseems. Proponents of the four-dimensional \u201cblock\nuniverse\u201d\u2014also known as eternalism\u2014hold\nthat there is no ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture, and that all times are equally real. They further hold that\nthere is no unique privileged present time, and a fortiori\nthat there is no such thing as a moving present. Block\ntheorists face a significant challenge: Why does time seem to pass if\nit doesn\u2019t? Part of the explanation lies in the way our memories\naccumulate, and intentions and decisions translate into actions (see\nIsmael 2011, 2013, 2016). Another part of the explanation lies in the\ncharacter of our experience. Time per se may not pass or\nflow, but there is something akin to passage and flow in our immediate\nexperience\u2014phenomenal passage we can call it\u2014or\nso many believe.\n\nThe block conception of time has its advantages. It has an appealing\nsimplicity, and accords well with Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheories, to mention but two. But the rejection of objective temporal\npassage is not to everyone\u2019s taste, and other conceptions of\ntime also have their advocates. The main contenders are depicted in\n Figure 8.1\n below. At the opposite extreme to the 4-D block view is\npresentism, the doctrine that concrete reality is confined to\nthe momentary present. Presentists deny any reality to the past or\nfuture. Coming in between these extremes is the growing block\nmodel. According to the latter, the past is real but the future is\nnot, and the sum total of reality is gradually increasing, by a\nprocess of moment-by-moment absolute becoming. On this view the\npresent is merely the most recent addition to reality; it is also the\ninterface between being and non-being. The moving spotlight\nmodel is in one respect akin to the standard block model: it accords\nreality to all times and events, including those yet to occur. It\ndiffers from the latter by virtue of the fact that it incorporates\nobjective passage into the universe, in the shape of a privileged (and\nconstantly advancing) present\u2014indicated by the blue line.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1 Four conceptions of the\nlarge-scale composition of the universe. [An\n extended description of figure 8.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhat McTaggart labelled the \u201cA-series\u201d runs from the\ndistant past, up through the recent past to the present, and then on\nto the future. The \u201cB-series\u201d is the series of positions\nwhich runs from earlier to later, and vice-versa. Properties such\nbeing past, present, or future are often\nknown as \u201cA-properties\u201d, whereas being earlier\nthan, being later than, and being simultaneous\nare known as \u201cB-properties\u201d or \u201cB-relations\u201d.\nThe block or eternalist conception of time is also often called\n\u201cthe B-theory\u201d. The opposed dynamic conceptions of time\nare often called \u201cA-theories\u201d.\n\nHow do these different metaphysical conceptions of time accord with\nour competing realist accounts of temporal consciousness? One point\nseems more obvious that most. If reality is confined to a momentary\npresent in the way presentists usually maintain, then it is difficult\nto see how any form of the extensional approach can be true. Our\nimmediate experience cannot extend through time if time itself has no\nextension; if earlier and later stream-phases are experienced\ntogether, in the way extensional models require, then it\nseems very plausible to suppose that these phases must both exist. Or\nto put it another way: an experience which no longer figures in the\nsum total of reality is not in a position to be part of the same\nunified state of consciousness as an experience which does so\nfigure, any more than a non-existent brick can help hold up a wall. By\ncontrast, since retentional theorists have the option of holding that\nour experience of time takes no time\u2014objectively\nspeaking\u2014their position looks to be entirely compatible with\npresentism, and similarly for the cinematic\n model.[19]\n As for the 4-D block conception, it looks equally compatible with all\nthe main views of temporal consciousness. The retentional\ntheorists\u2019 momentary specious presents can exist in universes of\nthis sort, as can those of cinematic theorists, but so too can the\nnon-momentary specious presents to be found in extensional models.\n8.2 The Argument from Experience\n\nDoes the character of temporal experience have any implications for\nthe nature of time per se? Could the dynamism we encounter in\nour temporal experience be sign of temporal passage or even a product\nof it? Does it bolster the A-theorist by providing evidence that time\nreally does pass? Claims that the passage of time features in our\nexperience are not difficult to find.\n\n\nThe best reason to believe that time passes is simply that we\nfind passage, that we are immediately and poignantly involved\nin the jerk and whoosh of process, the felt flow of one moment into\nthe next. (Williams 1951: 466)\n\n\n\nI cannot survey all the motivations philosophers have had for the\nmoving spotlight theory. But the motivation that I like best appeals\nto the nature of our conscious experience. Of all the experiences I\nwill ever have, some of them are special. Those are the ones that I am\nhaving NOW. All those others are ghostly and insubstantial. But which\nexperiences have this special feature keeps changing. (Skow 2009:\n\u00a75)\n\n\n\nI find it impossible to relinquish the sensation of a flowing time and\na moving present moment. It is something so basic to my experience of\nthe world that I am repelled by the claim that it only an illusion or\nmisperception. (Davies 1995: 275)\n\n\n\nThere is hardly any experience that seems more persistently, or\nimmediately given to us than the relentless flow of time. (Schlesinger\n1991: 427)\n\n\nGiven that there is more than one conception of what temporal passage\nitself amounts to the relationship between this sort of passage and\ntemporal experience will not be straightforward. However, Le Poidevin\nhas suggested that there is a general argument which connects the two,\nhe calls it \u201cthe argument from experience\u201d (Le Poidevin\n2007: \u00a75.1) and it can be formulated along these lines:\n\nWe have experiences that are seemingly of the passage of\ntime.\nThe best explanations of this sort of experience all rely on the\npassage of time being an objective feature of reality\nTherefore temporal passage is a real and objective feature of\nreality.\n\n\nAs Le Poidevin points out, a variety of quite different experiential\nconsiderations have been construed as linked to the passage of\ntime\u2014e.g., the perception of change and motion, the (seeming)\nconfinement of the present\u2014so there is a cluster of different\nissues which need to be investigated. Useful critical appraisals of\nthese ongoing debates include Baron et al. (2015), Deng (2013, 2018),\nFrischhut (2015), Hoerl (2014), Prosser (2007, 2012, 2013, 2016).\n\nAmong B-theorists who want to deny that time really does pass one\npopular strategy is to focus on the second premise of argument from\nexperience and find alternative explanations for experiences that are\nsuggestive of passage. L.A. Paul has argued there are well-known\nresults from psychology and the cognitive sciences which are\npotentially of great use to B-theorists seeking such\nexplanations\u2014see Paul (2010) and also Le Poidevin (2007:\n\u00a75.5). In the case of apparent motion, for example, two\nstationary flashing spots on a computer screen will be seen to be\nmoving smoothly back and forth, provided the spots are sufficiently\nclose together and the rate of flashing is not too fast or too slow.\nIn a similar fashion, the moving images on a cinema screen are a\nproduct of the ways in which our brains process the sequences of\nstatic images being projected onto the screen. Paul suggests that\nthere is a more general lesson here: much of the dynamism we are\nnaturally inclined to suppose exists in the world in reality is being\nfabricated in our brains:\n\n\nOccam's razor suggests that the flow or animated character that we\noften refer to as \u201cmotion\u201d is just a mistake. Motion is\nsimply the change of location of a persisting object, and the flow or\nanimated character that we notice and identify with motion is merely\nan effect of the brain. (Paul 2010:\n 358)[20]\n\n\nSimon Prosser is a B-theorist who has on a number of\noccasions\u2014e.g., Prosser (2000, 2007, 2012, 2013,\n2016)\u2014urged adopting a quite radical response to the argument\nfrom experience. For Prosser the idea that temporal experience could\nlend support to any form of temporal passage doctrine is radically\nmisconceived: it is in fact quite impossible. A-theories of time are\nmetaphysically incoherent and temporal passage is impossible.\nA-theoretic properties cannot exist, and cannot even be represented in\nconsciousness.\n\nIn arguing against A-theories Prosser develops and deploys \u201cthe\nDetector Argument\u201d. Smoke detectors can reliably detect the\npresence of smoke, Geiger counters can detect radiation, could there\nbe a physical device capable of detecting temporal passage, one (say)\nthat is equipped with a bulb which lights up when passage is found?\nProsser argues that such a device is impossible: \u201cthere could be\nno physical system that would detect the passage of time\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 34). The reason for this is simple and straightforward:\nalthough defenders of A-theories of time believe that time passes,\nthey don\u2019t usually hold that passage makes a detectable\nphysical difference to objects and events, and given this it is\nhard to see how any physical device could detect the existence of\ntemporal passage. Prosser points out that the positions on the nature\nof the relationship between mind and body that are currently taken\nseriously in contemporary philosophy all posit very close connections\nbetween minds and brains: either minds are brains, or the\nmental causally depends on brain processes down to their last detail.\nGiven the nature of this relationship \u201cif no physical system can\ndetect the passage of time then neither can the human mind\u201d\n(Prosser 2016: 35) and it is impossible for temporal passage to\nregister in human experience.\n\nProsser\u2019s claim that passage makes \u201cno physical difference\nto events\u201d is questionable on a number of counts. Some\nA-theorists equate temporal passage with the\ncoming-into-being of events\u2014presentists and growing\nblock theorists fall into this category. A-theorist of this kind will\nnot find Prosser\u2019s argument persuasive. They will point out that\nif time did not pass the physical universe as we know it simply would\nnot exist. Nothing would happen, there would be no physical\ninteractions between events, no event would cause another\nevent\u2014not if causation involves an earlier event bringing a\nlater event into existence. Indeed there wouldn\u2019t even any\nevents, since events are occurrences in time, and time for the\nA-theorist essentially involves passage. For more on this line of\nresponse see Phillips (2016), Skow (2018) and Dolev\n (2019).[21]\n\nEven if we set aside A-theories of this kind problems remains. Prosser\nnotes:\n\n\nArthur Eddington, who was aware, as long ago as 1928, that no physical\nsystem could detect the passage of time, drew the conclusion that\n\u201cconsciousness, looking out through a private door, can learn by\ndirect insight an underlying character of the world which physical\nmeasurements do not betray\u201d (Eddington 1928: 91) These days,\nhowever, I do not think we can regard views of this kind as\nacceptable. (Prosser 2016: 35)\n\n\nHowever, this issue is less straightforward than Prosser suggests. In\nThe Nature of the Physical World Eddington certainly did\nclaim that the material universe is dynamically temporal in a manner\nwhich physics does not recognize, and he also held that we know this\nbecause our consciousness provides us with some access to the real\nnature of the physical world. But in making these claims he\nwasn\u2019t relying on some sort of mystical revelation concerning\nthe true nature of things. Eddington defended a version of\npanpsychism, a fact which makes him something of a hero for\ncontemporary panpsychists\u2014see Strawson (2006) and Goff\n(2017).\n\nEddington, following in Russell\u2019s footsteps, held that physics\nonly reveals the causal and structural properties of physical things,\nit tells us nothing of their intrinsic nature\u2014about the inner\nnature of the stuff they are made from. If we assume, as seems\nplausible to many, that physical things must have some\nintrinsic nature, then if physics is silent in this regard there is an\nimportant consequence: the hypothesis that the physical processes in\nour brains associated with consciousness have an experiential\nintrinsic nature will be compatible with everything physics has to\nsay. In the light of this, Eddington suggests that it would be rather\nbizarre to adopt a different hypotheses and take the intrinsic nature\nof the relevant brain processes to be non-experiential:\n\n\nIt seems rather silly to prefer to attach it [consciousness] to\nsomething of a so-called \u201cconcrete\u201d nature inconsistent\nwith thought, and then to wonder where the thought comes from.\n(Eddington 1928: 259)\n\n\nSince there is nothing special about the material in our\nbrains\u2014they\u2019re composed of the same sort of basic physical\ningredients as mountains, oceans and trees\u2014then it seems\nplausible to conclude that if brain-stuff has an experiential\nintrinsic nature then all physical stuff\n will.[22]\n\nIt\u2019s true that Colin McGinn once characterized panpsychism in an\nutterly dismissive way:\n\n\na complete myth, a comforting piece of utter balderdash \u2026\nisn\u2019t there something vaguely hippyish, i.e. stoned, about the\ndoctrine? (2006: 93)\n\n\nIt\u2019s also true that panpsychism has its share of\nproblems\u2014in common to all the other attempted solutions to\nproblem of how consciousness and the physical world are related. But\nit\u2019s also the case that in contemporary philosophy of mind\ncircles panpsychism has a respectability it hasn\u2019t had for some\ntime\u2014see Br\u00fcntrup & Jaskolla (2016) and Seager\n(2019).\n\nReturning to the detector argument, if Eddington\u2019s response has\nto be treated with respect, then Prosser\u2019s conclusion that no\nphysical system can possibly detect any form of temporal passage looks\nto be premature. If our experiences are revealing the inner intrinsic\nnatures of certain neural processes\u2014as panpsychists\nmaintain\u2014then if these experiences possess dynamic flow-type\nproperties, then these properties will belong to the physical world.\nNeural processes, are after all, physical processes. In which case\nthere is at least one way in which a physical system can detect one\nform of temporal passage.\n\nThis point also has a more general metaphysical significance. If\npanpsychism is true then everything in the universe is enjoying some\nform of consciousness. If (as many suppose) consciousness is\nessentially temporal, then if panpsychism is true everything in the\nuniverse will be enjoying a temporal form of consciousness. In which\ncase the competing accounts of the structure of temporal experience\nare competing accounts of the nature of reality as a whole\u2014in\nmuch the way Bergson suggested, a century or so ago.",
