In a textbook example, if I know that you\nspent $10 on apples and oranges and that apples cost $1 while oranges\ncost $2, then I know that you did not buy six oranges, but I do not\nknow whether you bought one orange and eight apples, two oranges and\nsix apples, and so on. A simple scientific example can be found in the\nrationale behind the important methodological adage that\n\u201ccorrelation does not imply causation\u201d. If playing violent\nvideo games causes children to be more aggressive in their playground\nbehavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find a\ncorrelation between time spent playing such video games and aggressive\nbehavior on the playground. But that is also what we would\nexpect to find if children who are prone to aggressive behavior tend\nto enjoy and seek out violent video games more than other children, or\nif propensities for playing violent video games and for aggressive\nplayground behavior are both caused by some third factor (like being\nbullied or general parental neglect). So a high correlation between\ntime spent playing violent video games and aggressive playground\nbehavior (by itself) simply underdetermines what we should\nbelieve about the causal relationship between the two. But it turns\nout that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches the\nsurface of the various ways in which problems of underdetermination\ncan arise in the course of scientific investigation.\n", "toc": [{"#FirLooDuhQuiProUnd": "1.

A First Look: Duhem, Quine, and the Problems of Underdetermination\n\nThe scope of the epistemic challenge arising from underdetermination\nis not limited only to scientific contexts, as is perhaps most readily\nseen in classical skeptical attacks on our knowledge more generally.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes ([1640] 1996) famously sought to doubt any and\nall of his beliefs which could possibly be doubted by supposing that\nthere might be an all-powerful Evil Demon who sought to deceive him.\nDescartes\u2019 challenge appeals to a form of underdetermination: he\nnotes that all our sensory experiences would be just the same if they\nwere caused by this Evil Demon rather than an external world of rocks\nand trees. Likewise, Nelson Goodman\u2019s (1955) \u201cNew Riddle\nof Induction\u201d turns on the idea that the evidence we now have\ncould equally well be taken to support inductive generalizations quite\ndifferent from those we usually take them to support, with radically\ndifferent consequences for the course of future\n events.[1]\n Nonetheless, underdetermination has been thought to arise in\nscientific contexts in a variety of distinctive and important ways\nthat do not simply recreate such radically skeptical\npossibilities.\n\nThe traditional locus classicus for underdetermination in science is\nthe work of Pierre Duhem, a French physicist as well as historian and\nphilosopher of science who lived at the turn of the 20th\nCentury. In The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, Duhem\nformulated various problems of scientific underdetermination in an\nespecially perspicuous and compelling way, although he himself argued\nthat these problems posed serious challenges only to our efforts to\nconfirm theories in physics. In the middle of the 20th\nCentury, W. V. O. Quine suggested that such challenges applied not\nonly to the confirmation of all types of scientific theories, but to\nall knowledge claims whatsoever. His incorporation and further\ndevelopment of these problems as part of a general account of human\nknowledge was one of the most significant developments of\n20th Century epistemology. But neither Duhem nor Quine was\ncareful to systematically distinguish a number of fundamentally\ndistinct lines of thinking about underdetermination found in their\nwork. Perhaps the most important division is between what we might\ncall holist and contrastive forms of underdetermination. Holist\nunderdetermination (Section 2 below) arises whenever our inability to\ntest hypotheses in isolation leaves us underdetermined in our\nresponse to a failed prediction or some other piece of\ndisconfirming evidence. That is, because hypotheses have empirical\nimplications or consequences only when conjoined with other\nhypotheses and/or background beliefs about the world, a failed\nprediction or falsified empirical consequence typically leaves open to\nus the possibility of blaming and abandoning one of these background\nbeliefs and/or \u2018auxiliary\u2019 hypotheses rather than the\nhypothesis we set out to test in the first place. But contrastive\nunderdetermination (Section 3 below) involves the quite different\npossibility that for any body of evidence confirming a theory, there\nmight well be other theories that are also well confirmed by\nthat very same body of evidence. Moreover, claims of\nunderdetermination of either of these two fundamental varieties can\nvary in strength and character in any number of ways: one might, for\nexample, suggest that the choice between two theories or two ways of\nrevising our beliefs is transiently underdetermined simply by\nthe evidence we happen to have at present, or instead\npermanently underdetermined by all possible\nevidence. Indeed, the variety of forms of underdetermination that\nconfront scientific inquiry, and the causes and consequences claimed\nfor these different varieties, are sufficiently heterogeneous that\nattempts to address \u201cthe\u201d problem of underdetermination\nfor scientific theories have often engendered considerable confusion\nand argumentation at\n cross-purposes.[2]\n\nMoreover, such differences in the character and strength of various\nclaims of underdetermination turn out to be crucial for resolving the\nsignificance of the issue. For example, in some recently influential\ndiscussions of science it has become commonplace for scholars in a\nwide variety of academic disciplines to make casual appeal to claims\nof underdetermination (especially of the holist variety) to support\nthe idea that something besides evidence must step in to do\nthe further work of determining beliefs and/or changes of belief in\nscientific contexts. Perhaps most prominent among these are adherents\nof the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) movement and some\nfeminist science critics who have argued that it is typically the\nsociopolitical interests and/or pursuit of power and influence by\nscientists themselves which play a crucial and even decisive role in\ndetermining which beliefs are actually abandoned or retained in\nresponse to conflicting evidence. As we will see in Section 2.2,\nhowever, Larry Laudan has argued that such claims depend upon simple\nequivocation between comparatively weak or trivial forms of\nunderdetermination and the far stronger varieties from which they draw\nradical conclusions about the limited reach of evidence and\nrationality in science. In the sections that follow we will seek to\nclearly characterize and distinguish the various forms of both holist\nand contrastive underdetermination that have been suggested to arise\nin scientific contexts (noting some important connections between them\nalong the way), assess the strength and significance of the\nheterogeneous argumentative considerations offered in support of and\nagainst them, and consider just which forms of underdetermination pose\ngenuinely consequential challenges for scientific inquiry.\n2. Holist Underdetermination and Challenges to Scientific Rationality\n2.1 Holist Underdetermination: The Very Idea\n\nDuhem\u2019s original case for holist underdetermination is, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, intimately bound up with his arguments for\nconfirmational holism: the claim that theories or hypotheses can only\nbe subjected to empirical testing in groups or collections, never in\nisolation. The idea here is that a single scientific hypothesis does\nnot by itself carry any implications about what we should expect to\nobserve in nature; rather, we can derive empirical consequences from\nan hypothesis only when it is conjoined with many other beliefs and\nhypotheses, including background assumptions about the world, beliefs\nabout how measuring instruments operate, further hypotheses about the\ninteractions between objects in the original hypothesis\u2019 field\nof study and the surrounding environment, etc. For this reason, Duhem\nargues, when an empirical prediction is falsified, we do not know\nwhether the fault lies with the hypothesis we originally sought to\ntest or with one of the many other beliefs and hypotheses that were\nalso needed and used to generate the failed prediction:\n\nA physicist decides to demonstrate the inaccuracy of a proposition; in\norder to deduce from this proposition the prediction of a phenomenon\nand institute the experiment which is to show whether this phenomenon\nis or is not produced, in order to interpret the results of this\nexperiment and establish that the predicted phenomenon is not\nproduced, he does not confine himself to making use of the proposition\nin question; he makes use also of a whole group of theories accepted\nby him as beyond dispute. The prediction of the phenomenon, whose\nnonproduction is to cut off debate, does not derive from the\nproposition challenged if taken by itself, but from the proposition at\nissue joined to that whole group of theories; if the predicted\nphenomenon is not produced, the only thing the experiment teaches us\nis that among the propositions used to predict the phenomenon and to\nestablish whether it would be produced, there is at least one error;\nbut where this error lies is just what it does not tell us. ([1914]\n1954, 185)\n\n\nDuhem supports this claim with examples from physical theory,\nincluding one designed to illustrate a celebrated further consequence\nhe draws from it. Holist underdetermination ensures, Duhem argues,\nthat there cannot be any such thing as a \u201ccrucial\nexperiment\u201d (experimentum crucis): a single experiment whose\noutcome is predicted differently by two competing theories and which\ntherefore serves to definitively confirm one and refute the other. For\nexample, in a famous scientific episode intended to resolve the\nongoing heated battle between partisans of the theory that light\nconsists of a stream of particles moving at extremely high speed (the\nparticle or \u201cemission\u201d theory of light) and defenders of\nthe view that light consists instead of waves propagated through a\nmechanical medium (the wave theory), the physicist Foucault designed\nan apparatus to test the two theories\u2019 competing claims about\nthe speed of transmission of light in different media: the particle\ntheory implied that light would travel faster in water than in air,\nwhile the wave theory implied that the reverse was true. Although the\noutcome of the experiment was taken to show that light travels faster\nin air than in\n water,[3]\n Duhem argues that this is far from a refutation of the hypothesis of\nemission:\n\nin fact, what the experiment declares stained with error is the whole\ngroup of propositions accepted by Newton, and after him by Laplace and\nBiot, that is, the whole theory from which we deduce the relation\nbetween the index of refraction and the velocity of light in various\nmedia. But in condemning this system as a whole by declaring it\nstained with error, the experiment does not tell us where the error\nlies. Is it in the fundamental hypothesis that light consists in\nprojectiles thrown out with great speed by luminous bodies? Is it in\nsome other assumption concerning the actions experienced by light\ncorpuscles due to the media in which they move? We know nothing about\nthat. It would be rash to believe, as Arago seems to have thought,\nthat Foucault\u2019s experiment condemns once and for all the very\nhypothesis of emission, i.e., the assimilation of a ray of light to a\nswarm of projectiles. If physicists had attached some value to this\ntask, they would undoubtedly have succeeded in founding on this\nassumption a system of optics that would agree with Foucault\u2019s\nexperiment. ([1914] 1954, p. 187)\n\n\nFrom this and similar examples, Duhem drew the quite general\nconclusion that our response to the experimental or observational\nfalsification of a theory is always underdetermined in this way. When\nthe world does not live up to our theory-grounded expectations, we\nmust give up something, but because no hypothesis is ever\ntested in isolation, no experiment ever tells us precisely which\nbelief it is that we must revise or give up as mistaken:\n\nIn sum, the physicist can never subject an isolated hypothesis to\nexperimental test, but only a whole group of hypotheses; when the\nexperiment is in disagreement with his predictions, what he learns is\nthat at least one of the hypotheses constituting this group is\nunacceptable and ought to be modified; but the experiment does not\ndesignate which one should be changed. ([1914] 1954, 187)\n\n\nThe predicament Duhem here identifies is no mere rainy day puzzle for\nphilosophers of science, but a methodological challenge that\nconsistently arises in the course of scientific practice itself. It is\nsimply not true that for practical purposes and in concrete contexts\nthere is always just a single revision of our beliefs in response to\ndisconfirming evidence that is obviously correct, most promising, or\neven most sensible to pursue. To cite a classic example, when\nNewton\u2019s celestial mechanics failed to correctly predict the\norbit of Uranus, scientists at the time did not simply abandon the\ntheory but protected it from refutation by instead challenging the\nbackground assumption that the solar system contained only seven\nplanets. This strategy bore fruit, notwithstanding the falsity of\nNewton\u2019s theory: by calculating the location of a hypothetical\neighth planet influencing the orbit of Uranus, the astronomers Adams\nand Leverrier were eventually led to discover Neptune in 1846. But the\nvery same strategy failed when used to try to explain the advance of\nthe perihelion in Mercury\u2019s orbit by postulating the existence\nof \u201cVulcan\u201d, an additional planet located between Mercury\nand the sun, and this phenomenon would resist satisfactory explanation\nuntil the arrival of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. So\nit seems that Duhem was right to suggest not only that hypotheses must\nbe tested as a group or a collection, but also that it is by no means\na foregone conclusion which member of such a collection should be\nabandoned or revised in response to a failed empirical test or false\nimplication. Indeed, this very example illustrates why Duhem\u2019s\nown rather hopeful appeal to the \u2018good sense\u2019 of\nscientists themselves in deciding when a given hypothesis ought to be\nabandoned promises very little if any relief from the general\npredicament of holist underdetermination.\n\nAs noted above, Duhem thought that the sort of underdetermination he\nhad described presented a challenge only for theoretical physics, but\nsubsequent thinking in the philosophy of science has tended to the\nopinion that the predicament Duhem described applies to theoretical\ntesting in all fields of scientific inquiry. We cannot, for example,\ntest an hypothesis about the phenotypic effects of a particular gene\nwithout presupposing a host of further beliefs about what genes are,\nhow they work, how we can identify them, what other genes are doing,\nand so on. In the middle of the 20th Century, W. V. O.\nQuine would incorporate confirmational holism and its associated\nconcerns about underdetermination into an extraordinarily influential\naccount of knowledge in general. As part of his famous (1951) critique\nof the widely accepted distinction between truths that are analytic\n(true by definition, or as a matter of logic or language alone) and\nthose that are synthetic (true in virtue of some contingent fact about\nthe way the world is), Quine argued that all of the beliefs\nwe hold at any given time are linked in an interconnected web, which\nencounters our sensory experience only at its periphery:\n\nThe totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most\ncasual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of\natomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made\nfabric which impinges on experience only along the edges. Or, to\nchange the figure, total science is like a field of force whose\nboundary conditions are experience. A conflict with experience at the\nperiphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field. But\nthe total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions,\nexperience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what\nstatements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary\nexperience. No particular experiences are linked with any particular\nstatements in the interior of the field, except indirectly through\nconsiderations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole. (1951,\n42\u20133)\n\n\nOne consequence of this general picture of human knowledge is that all\nof our beliefs are tested against experience only as a corporate\nbody\u2014or as Quine sometimes puts it, \u201cThe unit of empirical\nsignificance is the whole of science\u201d (1951, p.\n 42).[4]\n A mismatch between what the web as a whole leads us to expect and the\nsensory experiences we actually receive will occasion some\nrevision in our beliefs, but which revision we should make to bring\nthe web as a whole back into conformity with our experiences is\nradically underdetermined by those experiences themselves. To use\nQuine\u2019s example, if we find our belief that there are brick\nhouses on Elm Street to be in conflict with our immediate sense\nexperience, we might revise our beliefs about the houses on Elm\nStreet, but we might equally well modify instead our beliefs about the\nappearance of brick, our present location, or innumerable other\nbeliefs constituting the interconnected web. In a pinch, we might even\ndecide that our present sensory experiences are simply hallucinations!\nQuine\u2019s point was not that any of these are particularly likely\nor reasonable responses to recalcitrant experiences (indeed, an\nimportant part of his account is the explanation of why they are not),\nbut instead that they would serve equally well to bring the web of\nbelief as a whole in line with our experience. And if the belief that\nthere are brick houses on Elm Street were sufficiently important to\nus, Quine insisted, it would be possible for us to preserve it\n\u201ccome what may\u201d (in the way of empirical evidence), by\nmaking sufficiently radical adjustments elsewhere in the web of\nbelief. It is in principle open to us, Quine argued, to revise even\nbeliefs about logic, mathematics, or the meanings of our terms in\nresponse to recalcitrant experience; it might seem a tempting solution\nto certain persistent difficulties in quantum mechanics, for example,\nto reject classical logic\u2019s law of the excluded middle (allowing\nphysical particles to both have and not have some determinate\nclassical physical property like position or momentum at a given\ntime). The only test of a belief, Quine argued, is whether it fits\ninto a web of connected beliefs that accords well with our experience\non the whole. And because this leaves any and all beliefs in\nthat web at least potentially subject to revision on the basis of our\nongoing sense experience or empirical evidence, he insisted, there\nsimply are no beliefs that are analytic in the originally supposed\nsense of immune to revision in light of experience, or true no matter\nwhat the world is like.\n\nQuine recognized, of course, that many of the logically possible ways\nof revising our beliefs in response to recalcitrant experiences that\nremain open to us nonetheless strike us as ad hoc, perfectly\nridiculous, or worse. He argues (1955) that our actual revisions of\nthe web of belief seek to maximize the theoretical\n\u201cvirtues\u201d of simplicity, familiarity, scope, and\nfecundity, along with conformity to experience, and elsewhere suggests\nthat we typically seek to resolve conflicts between the web of our\nbeliefs and our sensory experiences in accordance with a principle of\n\u201cconservatism\u201d, that is, by making the smallest possible\nnumber of changes to the least central beliefs we can that will\nsuffice to reconcile the web with experience. That is, Quine\nrecognized that when we encounter recalcitrant experience we are not\nusually at a loss to decide which of our beliefs to revise in response\nto it, but he claimed that this is simply because we are strongly\ndisposed as a matter of fundamental psychology to prefer whatever\nrevision requires the most minimal mutilation of the existing web of\nbeliefs and/or maximizes virtues that he explicitly recognizes as\npragmatic in character. Indeed, it would seem that on Quine\u2019s\nview the very notion of a belief being more central or peripheral or\nin lesser or greater \u201cproximity\u201d to sense experience\nshould be cashed out simply as a measure of our willingness to revise\nit in response to recalcitrant experience. That is, it would seem that\nwhat it means for one belief to be located\n\u201ccloser\u201d to the sensory periphery of the web than another\nis simply that we are more likely to revise the first than the second\nif doing so would enable us to bring the web as a whole into\nconformity with otherwise recalcitrant sense experience. Thus, Quine\nsaw the traditional distinction between analytic and synthetic beliefs\nas simply registering the endpoints of a psychological continuum\nordering our beliefs according to the ease and likelihood with which\nwe are prepared to revise them in order to reconcile the web as a\nwhole with our sense experience as a whole.\n2.2 Challenging the Rationality of Science\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that such holist underdetermination has\nbeen taken to pose a threat to the fundamental rationality of the\nscientific enterprise. The claim that the empirical evidence alone\nunderdetermines our response to failed predictions or recalcitrant\nexperience might even seem to invite the suggestion that what\nsystematically steps into the breach to do the further work of\nsingling out just one or a few candidate responses to disconfirming\nevidence is something irrational or at least arational in character.\nImre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend each suggested that because of\nunderdetermination, the difference between empirically successful and\nunsuccessful theories or research programs is largely a function of\nthe differences in talent, creativity, resolve, and resources of those\nwho advocate them. And at least since the influential work of Thomas\nKuhn, one important line of thinking about science has held that it is\nultimately the social and political interests (in a suitably broad\nsense) of scientists themselves which serve to determine their\nresponses to disconfirming evidence and therefore the further\nempirical, methodological, and other commitments of any given\nscientist or scientific community. Mary Hesse suggests that Quinean\nunderdetermination showed why certain \u201cnon-logical\u201d and\n\u201cextra-empirical\u201d considerations must play a role in\ntheory choice, and claims that \u201cit is only a short step from\nthis philosophy of science to the suggestion that adoption of such\ncriteria, that can be seen to be different for different groups and at\ndifferent periods, should be explicable by social rather than logical\nfactors\u201d (1980, 33). Perhaps the most prominent modern day\ndefenders of this line of thinking are those scholars in the sociology\nof scientific knowledge (SSK) movement and in feminist science studies\nwho argue that it is typically the career interests, political\naffiliations, intellectual allegiances, gender biases, and/or pursuit\nof power and influence by scientists themselves which play a crucial\nor even decisive role in determining precisely which beliefs are\nabandoned or retained when faced with conflicting evidence (classic\nworks in SSK include Bloor 1991, Collins 1992, and Shapin and Schaffer\n1985; in feminist science studies, see Longino, 1990, 2002, and for a\nrecent review, Nelson 2022). The shared argumentative schema here is\none on which holist underdetermination ensures that the evidence alone\ncannot do the work of picking out a unique response to failed\npredictions or recalcitrant experience, thus something else must step\nin to do the job, and sociologists of scientific knowledge, feminist\ncritics of science, and other interest-driven theorists of science\neach have their favored suggestions close to hand. (For useful further\ndiscussion, see Okasha 2000. Note that historians of science have also\nappealed to underdetermination in presenting \u201ccounterfactual\nhistories\u201d exploring the ways in which important historical\ndevelopments in science might have turned out quite differently than\nthey actually did; see, for example, Radick 2023.) \n\nIn response to this line of argument, Larry Laudan (1990) argues that\nthe significance of such underdetermination has been greatly\nexaggerated. Underdetermination actually comes in a wide variety of\nstrengths, he insists, depending on precisely what is being asserted\nabout the character, the availability, and (most importantly) the\nrational defensibility of the various competing hypotheses or\nways of revising our beliefs that the evidence supposedly leaves us\nfree to accept. Laudan usefully distinguishes a number of different\ndimensions along which claims of underdetermination vary in strength,\nand he goes on to insist that those who attribute dramatic\nsignificance to the thesis that our scientific theories are\nunderdetermined by the evidence defend only the weaker versions of\nthat thesis, yet draw dire consequences and shocking morals regarding\nthe character and status of the scientific enterprise from much\nstronger versions. He suggests, for instance, that Quine\u2019s\nfamous claim that any hypothesis can be preserved \u201ccome what\nmay\u201d in the way of evidence can be defended simply as a\ndescription of what it is psychologically possible for human\nbeings to do, but Laudan insists that in this form the thesis is\nsimply bereft of interesting or important consequences for\nepistemology\u2014 the study of knowledge. Along this\ndimension of variation, the strong version of the thesis asserts that\nit is always normatively or rationally defensible to retain\nany hypothesis in the light of any evidence whatsoever, but this\nlatter, stronger version of the claim, Laudan suggests, is one for\nwhich no convincing evidence or argument has ever been offered. More\ngenerally, Lauden argues, arguments for underdetermination turn on\nimplausibly treating all logically possible responses to the evidence\nas equally justified or rationally defensible. For example, Laudan\nsuggests that we might reasonably hold the resources of deductive\nlogic to be insufficient to single out just one acceptable\nresponse to disconfirming evidence, but not that deductive logic\nplus the sorts of ampliative principles of good reasoning\ntypically deployed in scientific contexts are insufficient to do\nso. Similarly, defenders of underdetermination might assert the\nnonuniqueness claim that for any given theory or web of\nbeliefs, either there is at least one alternative that can also be\nreconciled with the available evidence, or the much stronger claim\nthat all of the contraries of any given theory can be\nreconciled with the available evidence equally well. And the claim of\nsuch \u201creconciliation\u201d itself disguises a wide range of\nfurther alternative possibilities: that our theories can be made\nlogically compatible with any amount of disconfirming\nevidence (perhaps by the simple expedient of removing any claim(s)\nwith which the evidence is in conflict), that any theory may be\nreformulated or revised so as to entail any piece of\npreviously disconfirming evidence, or so as to explain\npreviously disconfirming evidence, or that any theory can be made to\nbe as well supported empirically by any collection of\nevidence as any other theory. And in all of these respects,\nLaudan claims, partisans have defended only the weaker forms of\nunderdetermination while founding their further claims about and\nconceptions of the scientific enterprise on versions much stronger\nthan those they have managed or even attempted to defend.\n\nLaudan is certainly right to distinguish these various versions of\nholist underdetermination, and he is equally right to suggest that\nmany of the thinkers he confronts have derived grand morals concerning\nthe scientific enterprise from much stronger versions of\nunderdetermination than they are able to defend, but the underlying\nsituation is somewhat more complex than he suggests. Laudan\u2019s\noverarching claim is that champions of holist underdetermination show\nonly that a wide variety of responses to disconfirming evidence are\nlogically possible (or even just psychologically possible), rather\nthan that these are all rationally defensible or equally\nwell-supported by the evidence. But his straightforward appeal to\nfurther epistemic resources like ampliative principles of belief\nrevision that are supposed to help narrow the merely logical\npossibilities down to those which are reasonable or rationally\ndefensible is itself problematic, at least as part of any attempt to\nrespond to Quine. This is because on Quine\u2019s holist picture of\nknowledge such further ampliative principles governing legitimate\nbelief revision are themselves simply part of the web of our\nbeliefs, and are therefore open to revision in response to\nrecalcitrant experience as well. Indeed, this is true even for the\nprinciples of deductive logic and the (consequent) demand for\nparticular forms of logical consistency between parts of the web\nitself! So while it is true that the ampliative principles we\ncurrently embrace do not leave all logically or even psychologically\npossible responses to the evidence open to us (or leave us free to\npreserve any hypothesis \u201ccome what may\u201d), our continued\nadherence to these very principles, rather than being willing\nto revise the web of belief so as to abandon them, is part of the\nphenomenon to which Quine is using underdetermination to draw our\nattention, and so cannot be taken for granted without begging the\nquestion. Put another way, Quine does not simply ignore the further\nprinciples that function to ensure that we revise the web of belief in\none way rather than others, but it follows from his account that such\nprinciples are themselves part of the web and therefore candidates for\nrevision in our efforts to bring the web of beliefs into conformity\n(by the resulting web\u2019s own lights) with sensory experience.\nThis recognition makes clear why it will be extremely difficult to say\nhow the shift to an alternative web of belief (with alternative\nampliative or even deductive principles of belief revision) should or\neven can be evaluated for its rational defensibility. Each proposed\nrevision is likely to be maximally rational by the lights of the\nprinciples it itself\n sanctions.[5]\n Of course we can rightly say that many candidate revisions would\nviolate our presently accepted ampliative principles of\nrational belief revision, but the preference we have for those rather\nthan the alternatives is itself simply generated by their position in\nthe web of belief we have inherited, and the role that they themselves\nplay in guiding the revisions we are inclined to make to that web in\nlight of ongoing experience.\n\nThus, if we accept Quine\u2019s general picture of knowledge, it\nbecomes quite difficult to disentangle normative from descriptive\nissues, or questions about the psychology of human belief revision\nfrom questions about the justifiability or rational defensibility of\nsuch revisions. It is in part for this reason that Quine famously\nsuggests (1969, 82; see also p 75\u201376) that epistemology itself\n\u201cfalls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of\nnatural science.\u201d His point is not that epistemology should\nsimply be abandoned in favor of psychology, but instead that there is\nultimately no way to draw a meaningful distinction between the two.\n(James Woodward, in comments on an earlier draft of this entry,\npointed out that this makes it all the harder to assess the\nsignificance of Quinean underdetermination in light of Laudan\u2019s\ncomplaint or even know the rules for doing so, but in an important way\nthis difficulty was Quine\u2019s point all along!) Quine\u2019s\nclaim is that \u201c[e]ach man is given a scientific heritage plus a\ncontinuing barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations\nwhich guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his\ncontinuing sensory promptings are, where rational, pragmatic\u201d\n(1951, 46), but the role of these pragmatic considerations or\nprinciples in selecting just one of the many possible revisions of the\nweb of belief in response to recalcitrant experience is not to be\ncontrasted with those same principles having rational or epistemic\njustification. Far from conflicting with or even being orthogonal to\nthe search for truth and our efforts to render our beliefs maximally\nresponsive to the evidence, Quine insists, revising our beliefs in\naccordance with such pragmatic principles \u201cat bottom, is what\nevidence is\u201d (1955, 251). Whether or not this strongly\nnaturalistic conception of epistemology can ultimately be defended, it\nis misleading for Laudan to suggest that the thesis of\nunderdetermination becomes trivial or obviously insupportable the\nmoment we inquire into the rational defensibility rather than the mere\nlogical or psychological possibility of alternative revisions to the\nholist\u2019s web of belief.\n\nIn fact, there is an important connection between this lacuna in\nLaudan\u2019s discussion and the further uses made of the thesis of\nunderdetermination by sociologists of scientific knowledge, feminist\nepistemologists, and other vocal champions of holist\nunderdetermination. When faced with the invocation of further\nampliative standards or principles that supposedly rule out some\nresponses to disconfirmation as irrational or unreasonable, these\nthinkers typically respond by insisting that the embrace of such\nfurther standards or principles (or perhaps their application to\nparticular cases) is itself underdetermined, historically\ncontingent, and/or subject to ongoing social negotiation. For this\nreason, they suggest, such appeals (and their success or failure in\nconvincing the members of a given community) should be explained by\nreference to the same broadly social and political interests that they\nclaim are at the root of theory choice and belief change in science\nmore generally (see, e.g., Shapin and Schaffer, 1985). On both\naccounts, then, our response to recalcitrant evidence or a failed\nprediction is constrained in important ways by features of the\nexisting web of beliefs. But for Quine, the continuing force of these\nconstraints is ultimately imposed by the fundamental principles of\nhuman psychology (such as our preference for minimal mutilation of the\nweb, or the pragmatic virtues of simplicity, fecundity, etc.), while\nfor constructivist theorists of science such as Shapin and Schaffer,\nthe continuing force of any such constraints is limited only by the\nongoing negotiated agreement of the communities of scientists who\nrespect them.\n\nAs this last contrast makes clear, recognizing the limitations of\nLaudan\u2019s critique of Quine and the fact that we cannot dismiss\nholist underdetermination with any straightforward appeal to\nampliative principles of good reasoning by itself does nothing to\nestablish the further positive claims about belief revision\nadvanced by interest-driven theorists of science. Conceding that\ntheory choice or belief revision in science is underdetermined by the\nevidence in just the ways that Duhem and/or Quine suggested leaves\nentirely open whether it is instead the (suitably broad) social or\npolitical interests of scientists themselves that do the further work\nof singling out the particular beliefs or responses to falsifying\nevidence that any particular scientist or scientific community will\nactually adopt or find compelling. Even many of those philosophers of\nscience who are most strongly convinced of the general significance of\nvarious forms of underdetermination remain deeply skeptical of this\nlatter thesis and thoroughly unconvinced by the empirical evidence\nthat has been offered in support of it (usually in the form of case\nstudies of particular historical episodes in science).\n\nAppeals to underdetermination have also loomed large in recent\nphilosophical debates concerning the place of values in science, with\na number of authors arguing that the underdetermination of theory by\ndata is among the central reasons that values (or\n\u201cnon-epistemic\u201d values) do and perhaps must play a central\nrole in scientific inquiry. Feminist philosophers of science have\nsometimes suggested that it is such underdetermination which creates\nroom not only for unwarranted androcentric values or assumptions to\nplay central roles in the embrace of particular theoretical\npossibilities, but also for the critical and alternative approaches\nfavored by feminists themselves (e.g. Nelson 2022). But appeals to\nunderdetermination also feature prominently in more general arguments\nagainst the possibility or desirability of value-free science. Perhaps\nmost influentially, Helen Longino\u2019s \u201ccontextual\nempiricism\u201d suggests that a wide variety of non-epistemic values\nplay important roles in determining our scientific beliefs in part\nbecause underdetermination prevents data or evidence alone from doing\nso. For this and other reasons she concludes that objectivity in\nscience is therefore best served by a diverse set of participants who\nbring a variety of different values or value-laden assumptions to the\nenterprise (Longino 1990, 2002).\n3. Contrastive Underdetermination, Empirical Equivalents, and Unconceived Alternatives\n3.1 Contrastive Underdetermination: Back to Duhem\n\nAlthough it is also a form of underdetermination, what we described in\nSection 1 above as contrastive underdetermination raises fundamentally\ndifferent issues from the holist variety considered in Section 2 (Bonk\n2008 raises many of these issues). John Stuart Mill articulated the\nchallenge of contrastive underdetermination with impressive clarity in\nA System of Logic, where he writes:\n\nMost thinkers of any degree of sobriety allow, that an hypothesis...is\nnot to be received as probably true because it accounts for all the\nknown phenomena, since this is a condition sometimes fulfilled\ntolerably well by two conflicting hypotheses...while there are\nprobably a thousand more which are equally possible, but which, for\nwant of anything analogous in our experience, our minds are unfitted\nto conceive. ([1867] 1900, 328)\n\n\nThis same concern is also evident in Duhem\u2019s original writings\nconcerning so-called crucial experiments, where he seeks to show that\neven when we explicitly suspend any concerns about holist\nunderdetermination, the contrastive variety remains an obstacle to our\ndiscovery of truth in theoretical science:\n\nBut let us admit for a moment that in each of these systems\n[concerning the nature of light] everything is compelled to be\nnecessary by strict logic, except a single hypothesis; consequently,\nlet us admit that the facts, in condemning one of the two systems,\ncondemn once and for all the single doubtful assumption it contains.\nDoes it follow that we can find in the \u2018crucial\nexperiment\u2019 an irrefutable procedure for transforming one of the\ntwo hypotheses before us into a demonstrated truth? Between two\ncontradictory theorems of geometry there is no room for a third\njudgment; if one is false, the other is necessarily true. Do two\nhypotheses in physics ever constitute such a strict dilemma? Shall we\never dare to assert that no other hypothesis is imaginable? Light may\nbe a swarm of projectiles, or it may be a vibratory motion whose waves\nare propagated in a medium; is it forbidden to be anything else at\nall? ([1914] 1954, 189)\n\n\nContrastive underdetermination is so-called because it questions the\nability of the evidence to confirm any given hypothesis against\nalternatives, and the central focus of discussion in this\nconnection (equally often regarded as \u201cthe\u201d problem of\nunderdetermination) concerns the character of the supposed\nalternatives. Of course the two problems are not entirely\ndisconnected, because it is open to us to consider alternative\npossible modifications of the web of beliefs as alternative theories\nbetween which the empirical evidence alone is powerless to decide. But\nwe have already seen that one need not think of the\nalternative responses to recalcitrant experience as competing\ntheoretical alternatives to appreciate the character of the\nholist\u2019s challenge, and we will see that one need not embrace\nany version of holism about confirmation to appreciate the quite\ndistinct problem that the available evidence might support more than\none theoretical alternative. It is perhaps most useful here to think\nof holist underdetermination as starting from a particular theory or\nbody of beliefs and claiming that our revision of those beliefs in\nresponse to new evidence may be underdetermined, while contrastive\nunderdetermination instead starts from a given body of evidence and\nclaims that more than one theory may be well-supported by that\nevidence. Part of what has contributed to the conflation of these two\nproblems is the holist presuppositions of those who originally made\nthem famous. After all, on Quine\u2019s view, we simply revise the\nweb of belief in response to recalcitrant experience, and so the\nsuggestion that there are multiple possible revisions of the web\navailable in response to any particular evidential finding just\nis the claim that there are in fact many different\n\u201ctheories\u201d (i.e. candidate webs of belief) that are\nequally well-supported by any given body of\n data.[6]\n But if we give up such extreme holist views of evidence, meaning,\nand/or confirmation, the two problems take on very different\nidentities, with very different considerations in favor of taking them\nseriously, very different consequences, and very different candidate\nsolutions. Notice, for instance, that even if we somehow knew that no\nother hypothesis on a given subject was well-confirmed by a given body\nof data, that would not tell us where to place the blame or which of\nour beliefs to give up if the remaining hypothesis in conjunction with\nothers subsequently resulted in a failed empirical prediction. And as\nDuhem suggests in the passage cited above, even if we supposed that we\nsomehow knew exactly which of our hypotheses to blame in response to a\nfailed empirical prediction, this would not help us to decide whether\nor not there are other hypotheses available that are also\nwell-confirmed by the data we actually have.\n\nOne way to see why not is to consider an analogy that champions of\ncontrastive underdetermination have sometimes used to support their\ncase. If we consider any finite group of data points, an elementary\nproof reveals that there are an infinite number of distinct\nmathematical functions describing different curves that will pass\nthrough all of them. As we add further data to our initial set we will\neliminate functions describing curves which no longer capture all of\nthe data points in the new, larger set, but no matter how much data we\naccumulate, there will always be an infinite number of functions\nremaining that define curves including all the data points in\nthe new set and which would therefore seem to be equally well\nsupported by the empirical evidence. No finite amount of data\nwill ever be able to narrow the possibilities down to just a\nsingle function or indeed, any finite number of candidate functions,\nfrom which the distribution of data points we have might have been\ngenerated. Each new data point we gather eliminates an infinite number\nof curves that previously fit all the data (so the problem\nhere is not the holist\u2019s challenge that we do not know which\nbeliefs to give up in response to failed predictions or disconfirming\nevidence), but also leaves an infinite number still in contention.\n3.2 Empirically Equivalent Theories\n\nOf course, generating and testing fundamental scientific hypotheses is\nrarely if ever a matter of finding curves that fit collections of data\npoints, so nothing follows directly from this mathematical analogy for\nthe significance of contrastive underdetermination in most scientific\ncontexts. But Bas van Fraassen has offered an extremely influential\nline of argument intended to show that such contrastive\nunderdetermination is a serious concern for scientific theorizing more\ngenerally. In The Scientific Image (1980), van Fraassen uses\na now-classic example to illustrate the possibility that even our best\nscientific theories might have empirical equivalents: that\nis, alternative theories making the very same empirical predictions,\nand which therefore cannot be better or worse supported by any\npossible body of evidence. Consider Newton\u2019s cosmology,\nwith its laws of motion and gravitational attraction. As Newton\nhimself realized, exactly the same predictions are made by the theory\nwhether we assume that the entire universe is at rest or assume\ninstead that it is moving with some constant velocity in any given\ndirection: from our position within it, we have no way to detect\nconstant, absolute motion by the universe as a whole. Thus, van\nFraassen argues, we are here faced with empirically equivalent\nscientific theories: Newtonian mechanics and gravitation conjoined\neither with the fundamental assumption that the universe is at\nabsolute rest (as Newton himself believed), or with any one of an\ninfinite variety of alternative assumptions about the constant\nvelocity with which the universe is moving in some particular\ndirection. All of these theories make all and only the same empirical\npredictions, so no evidence will ever permit us to decide between them\non empirical\n grounds.[7]\n\nVan Fraassen is widely (though mistakenly) regarded as holding that\nthe prospect of contrastive underdetermination grounded in such\nempirical equivalents demands that we restrict our epistemic ambitions\nfor the scientific enterprise itself. His constructive empiricism\nholds that the aim of science is not to find true theories, but only\ntheories that are empirically adequate: that is, theories whose claims\nabout observable phenomena are all true. Since the empirical\nadequacy of a theory is not threatened by the existence of another\nthat is empirically equivalent to it, fulfilling this aim has nothing\nto fear from the possibility of such empirical equivalents. In reply,\nmany critics have suggested that van Fraassen gives no reasons for\nrestricting belief to empirical adequacy that could not also be used\nto argue for suspending our belief in the future empirical\nadequacy of our best present theories. Of course there could\nbe empirical equivalents to our best theories, but there could also be\ntheories equally well-supported by all the evidence up to the present\nwhich diverge in their predictions about observables in future cases\nnot yet tested. This challenge seems to miss the point of van\nFraassen\u2019s epistemic voluntarism: his claim is that we should\nbelieve no more but also no less than we need to take full\nadvantage of our scientific theories, and a commitment to the\nempirical adequacy of our theories, he suggests, is the least we can\nget away with in this regard. Of course it is true that we are running\nsome epistemic risk in believing in even the full empirical adequacy\nof our present theories, but this is the minimum we need to take full\nadvantage of the fruits of our scientific labors, and the risk is\nconsiderably less than what we assume in believing in their truth: as\nvan Fraassen famously suggests, \u201cit is not an epistemic\nprinciple that one might as well hang for a sheep as a lamb\u201d\n(1980, 72).\n\nIn an influential discussion, Larry Laudan and Jarrett Leplin (1991)\nargue that philosophers of science have invested even the bare\npossibility that our theories might have empirical equivalents with\nfar too much epistemic significance. Notwithstanding the popularity of\nthe presumption that there are empirically equivalent rivals to every\ntheory, they argue, the conjunction of several familiar and relatively\nuncontroversial epistemological theses is sufficient to defeat it.\nBecause the boundaries of what is observable change as we develop new\nexperimental methods and instruments, because auxiliary assumptions\nare always needed to derive empirical consequences from a theory (cf.\nconfirmational holism, above), and because these auxiliary assumptions\nare themselves subject to change over time, Laudan and Leplin conclude\nthat there is no guarantee that any two theories judged to be\nempirically equivalent at a given time will remain so as the state of\nour knowledge advances. Accordingly, any judgment of empirical\nequivalence is both defeasible and relativized to a particular state\nof science. So even if two theories are empirically equivalent at a\ngiven time this is no guarantee that they will remain so, and\nthus there is no foundation for a general pessimism about our ability\nto distinguish theories that are empirically equivalent to each other\non empirical grounds. Although they concede that we could have good\nreason to think that particular theories have empirically equivalent\nrivals, this must be established case-by-case rather than by any\ngeneral argument or presumption.\n\nOne fairly standard reply to this line of argument is to suggest that\nwhat Laudan and Leplin really show is that the notion of empirical\nequivalence must be applied to larger collections of beliefs than\nthose traditionally identified as scientific theories\u2014at least\nlarge enough to encompass the auxiliary assumptions needed to derive\nempirical predictions from them. At the extreme, perhaps this means\nthat the notion of empirical equivalents (or at least timeless\nempirical equivalents) cannot be applied to anything less than\n\u201csystems of the world\u201d (i.e. total Quinean webs of\nbelief), but even that is not fatal: what the champion of contrastive\nunderdetermination asserts is that there are empirically equivalent\nsystems of the world that incorporate different theories of\nthe nature of light, or spacetime, or whatever (for useful discussion,\nsee Okasha 2002). On the other hand, it might seem that quick examples\nlike van Fraassen\u2019s variants of Newtonian cosmology do not serve\nto make this thesis as plausible as the more limited claim of\nempirical equivalence for individual theories. It seems equally\nnatural, however, to respond to Laudan and Leplin simply by conceding\nthe variability in empirical equivalence but insisting that this is\nnot enough to undermine the problem. Empirical equivalents create a\nserious obstacle to belief in a theory so long as there is\nsome empirical equivalent to that theory at any given time,\nbut it need not be the same one at each time. On this line of\nthinking, cases like van Fraassen\u2019s Newtonian example illustrate\nhow easy it is for theories to admit of empirical equivalents at any\ngiven time, and thus constitute a reason for thinking that there\nprobably are or will be empirical equivalents to any given theory at\nany particular time, assuring that whenever the question of belief in\na given theory arises, the challenge posed to it by contrastive\nunderdetermination arises as well.\n\nLaudan and Leplin also suggest, however, that even if the universal\nexistence of empirical equivalents were conceded, this would do much\nless to establish the significance of underdetermination than its\nchampions have supposed, because \u201ctheories with exactly the same\nempirical consequences may admit of differing degrees of evidential\nsupport\u201d (1991, 465). A theory may be better supported than an\nempirical equivalent, for instance, because the former but not the\nlatter is derivable from a more general theory whose consequences\ninclude a third, well supported, hypothesis. More generally, the\nbelief-worthiness of an hypothesis depends crucially on how it is\nconnected or related to other things we believe and the evidential\nsupport we have for those other\n beliefs.[8]\n Laudan and Leplin suggest that we have invited the specter of rampant\nunderdetermination only by failing to keep this familiar home truth in\nmind and instead implausibly identifying the evidence bearing on a\ntheory exclusively with the theory\u2019s own entailments or\nempirical consequences (but cf. Tulodziecki 2012). This impoverished\nview of evidential support, they argue, is in turn the legacy of a\nfailed foundationalist and positivistic approach to the philosophy of\nscience which mistakenly assimilates epistemic questions about how to\ndecide whether or not to believe a theory to semantic questions about\nhow to establish a theory\u2019s meaning or truth-conditions.\n\nJohn Earman (1993) has argued that this dismissive diagnosis does not\ndo justice to the threat posed by underdetermination. He argues that\nworries about underdetermination are an aspect of the more general\nquestion of the reliability of our inductive methods for determining\nbeliefs, and notes that we cannot decide how serious a problem\nunderdetermination poses without specifying (as Laudan and Leplin do\nnot) the inductive methods we are considering. Earman regards some\nversion of Bayesianism as our most promising form of inductive\nmethodology, and he proceeds to show that challenges to the long-run\nreliability of our Bayesian methods can be motivated by considerations\nof the empirical indistinguishability (in several different and\nprecisely specified senses) of hypotheses stated in any language\nricher than that of the evidence itself that do not amount simply to\ngeneral skepticism about those inductive methods. In other words, he\nshows that there are more reasons to worry about underdetermination\nconcerning inferences to hypotheses about unobservables than to, say,\ninferences about unobserved observables. He also goes on to argue that\nat least two genuine cosmological theories have serious, nonskeptical,\nand nonparasitic empirical equivalents: the first essentially replaces\nthe gravitational field in Newtonian mechanics with curvature in\nspacetime itself,\n [9]\n while the second recognizes that Einstein\u2019s General Theory of\nRelativity permits cosmological models exhibiting different global\ntopological features which cannot be distinguished by any evidence\ninside the light cones of even idealized observers who live\n forever.[10]\n And he suggests that \u201cthe production of a few concrete examples\nis enough to generate the worry that only a lack of imagination on our\npart prevents us from seeing comparable examples of underdetermination\nall over the map\u201d (1993, 31) even as he concedes that his case\nleaves open just how far the threat of underdetermination extends\n(1993, 36).\n\nMost philosophers of science, however, have not embraced the idea that\nit is only lack of imagination which prevents us from finding\nempirical equivalents to our scientific theories generally. They note\nthat the convincing examples of empirical equivalents we do have are\nall drawn from a single domain of highly mathematized scientific\ntheorizing in which the background constraints on serious theoretical\nalternatives are far from clear, and suggest that it is therefore\nreasonable to ask whether even a small handful of such examples should\nmake us believe that there are probably empirical equivalents to most\nof our scientific theories most of the time. They concede that it is\nalways possible that there are empirical equivalents to even\nour best scientific theories concerning any domain of nature, but\ninsist that we should not be willing to suspend belief in any\nparticular theory until some convincing alternative to it can\nactually be produced: as Philip Kitcher puts it, \u201cgive us a\nrival explanation, and we\u2019ll consider whether it is sufficiently\nserious to threaten our confidence\u201d (1993, 154; see also Leplin\n1997, Achinstein 2002). That is, these thinkers insist that until we\nare able to actually construct an empirically equivalent\nalternative to a given theory, the bare possibility that such\nequivalents exist is insufficient to justify suspending belief in the\nbest theories we do have. For this same reason most philosophers of\nscience are unwilling to follow van Fraassen into what they regard as\nconstructive empiricism\u2019s unwarranted epistemic modesty. Even if\nvan Fraassen is right about the most minimal beliefs we must hold in\norder to take full advantage of our scientific theories, most thinkers\ndo not see why we should believe the least we can get away with rather\nthan believing the most we are entitled to by the evidence we\nhave.\n\nChampions of contrastive underdetermination have most frequently\nresponded by trying to establish that all theories have\nempirical equivalents, typically by proposing something like an\nalgorithmic procedure for generating such equivalents from any theory\nwhatsoever. Stanford (2001, 2006) suggests that these efforts to\nprove that all our theories must have empirical equivalents\nfall roughly but reliably into global and local varieties, and that\nneither makes a convincing case for a distinctive scientific problem\nof contrastive underdetermination. Global algorithms are\nwell-represented by Andre Kukla\u2019s (1996) suggestion that from\nany theory T we can immediately generate such empirical\nequivalents as T\u2032 (the claim that T\u2019s\nobservable consequences are true, but T itself is false),\nT\u2033 (the claim that the world behaves according to\nT when observed, but some specific incompatible alternative\notherwise), and the hypothesis that our experience is being\nmanipulated by powerful beings in such a way as to make it appear that\nT is true. But such possibilities, Stanford argues, amount to\nnothing more than the sort of Evil Deceiver to which Descartes\nappealed in order to doubt any of his beliefs that could possibly be\ndoubted (see Section 1, above). Such radically skeptical scenarios\npose an equally powerful (or powerless) challenge to any knowledge\nclaim whatsoever, no matter how it is arrived at or justified, and\nthus pose no special problem or challenge for beliefs offered\nto us by theoretical science. If global algorithms like Kukla\u2019s\nare the only reasons we can give for taking underdetermination\nseriously in a scientific context, then there is no distinctive\nproblem of the underdetermination of scientific theories by data, only\na salient reminder of the irrefutability of classically Cartesian or\nradical\n skepticism.[11]\n\nIn contrast to such global strategies for generating empirical\nequivalents, local algorithmic strategies instead begin with some\nparticular scientific theory and proceed to generate alternative\nversions that will be equally well supported by all possible evidence.\nThis is what van Fraassen does with the example of Newtonian\ncosmology, showing that an infinite variety of supposed empirical\nequivalents can be produced by ascribing different constant absolute\nvelocities to the universe as a whole. But Stanford suggests that\nempirical equivalents generated in this way are also insufficient to\nshow that there is a distinctive and genuinely troubling form of\nunderdetermination afflicting scientific theories, because they rely\non simply saddling particular scientific theories with further claims\nfor which those theories themselves (together with whatever background\nbeliefs we actually hold) imply that we cannot have any evidence. Such\nempirical equivalents invite the natural response that they simply\ntack on to our theories further commitments that are or should be no\npart of those theories themselves. Such claims, it seems, should\nsimply be excised from our theories, leaving over just the claims that\nsensible defenders would have held were all we were entitled to\nbelieve by the evidence in any case. In van Fraassen\u2019s Newtonian\nexample, for instance, this could be done simply by undertaking no\ncommitment concerning the absolute velocity and direction (or lack\nthereof) of the universe as a whole. Note also that if we believe a\ngiven scientific theory when one of the empirical equivalents we could\ngenerate from it by the local algorithmic strategy is correct instead,\nmost of what we originally believed will nonetheless turn out to be\nstraightforwardly true. Philosophers of science have responded in\na variety of ways to the suggestion that a few or even a small handful\nof serious examples of empirical equivalents does not suffice to\nestablish that there are probably such equivalents to most scientific\ntheories in most domains of inquiry. One such reaction has been to\ninvite more careful attention to the details of particular examples of\nputative underdetermination: considerable work has been devoted to\nassessing the threat of underdetermination in the case of particular\nscientific theories (for recent examples see Pietsch 2012; Tulodziecki\n2013; Werndl 2013; Belot 2014; Butterfield 2014; Miyake 2015; Kovaka\n2019; Fletcher 2021, and others). Other thinkers have sought to\ninvestigate whether certain types of scientific theories or theories\nin particular scientific fields differ in the extent to which they are\ngenuinely threatened by underdetermination. Some have argued that\nunderdetermination poses a less serious (Cleland 2002; Carman 2005) or\na more serious (Turner 2005, 2007) challenge for\n\u2018historical\u2019 sciences like geology, paleontology, and\narchaeology than it does for \u2018experimental\u2019 sciences like\nparticle physics. Others have resisted such generalizations but\nnonetheless argued that underdetermination predicaments arise in\ndistinctive or characteristic ways in historical sciences and that\nscientists in these fields have different resources and strategies for\naddressing them (Currie 2018; Forber and Griffith 2011; Stanford\n2010). Finally, some thinkers have sought to defend particular forms\nof explanation frequently deployed in historical sciences, such as\nnarrative explanation (Sterelny and Currie 2017), from the charge that\nthey suffer from rampant underdetermination.\n\n3.3 Unconceived Alternatives and A New Induction\n\nStanford (2001, 2006) concludes that no convincing general case has\nbeen made for the presumption that there are empirically equivalent\nrivals to all or most scientific theories, or to any theories besides\nthose for which such equivalents can actually be constructed. But he\ngoes on to insist that empirical equivalents are no essential part of\nthe case for a significant problem of contrastive underdetermination.\nOur efforts to confirm scientific theories, he suggests, are no less\nthreatened by what Larry Sklar (1975, 1981) has called\n\u201ctransient\u201d underdetermination, that is, theories which\nare not empirically equivalent but are equally (or at least\nreasonably) well confirmed by all the evidence we happen to have in\nhand at the moment, so long as this transient predicament is also\n\u201crecurrent\u201d, that is, so long as we think that there is\n(probably) at least one such (fundamentally distinct) alternative\navailable\u2014and thus the transient predicament\nre-arises\u2014whenever we are faced with a decision about whether to\nbelieve a given theory at a given time. Stanford argues that a\nconvincing case for contrastive underdetermination of this recurrent,\ntransient variety can indeed be made, and that the evidence for it is\navailable in the historical record of scientific inquiry itself.\n\nStanford concedes that present theories are not transiently\nunderdetermined by the theoretical alternatives we have actually\ndeveloped and considered to date: we think that our own scientific\ntheories are considerably better confirmed by the evidence than any\nrivals we have actually produced. The central question, he argues, is\nwhether we should believe that there are well confirmed alternatives\nto our best scientific theories that are presently\nunconceived by us. And the primary reason we should believe that\nthere are, he claims, is the long history of repeated transient\nunderdetermination by previously unconceived alternatives\nacross the course of scientific inquiry. In the progression from\nAristotelian to Cartesian to Newtonian to contemporary mechanical\ntheories, for instance, the evidence available at the time each\nearlier theory dominated the practice of its day also offered\ncompelling support for each of the later alternatives (unconceived at\nthe time) that would ultimately come to displace it. Stanford\u2019s\n\u201cNew Induction\u201d over the history of science claims that\nthis situation is typical; that is, that \u201cwe have, throughout\nthe history of scientific inquiry and in virtually every scientific\nfield, repeatedly occupied an epistemic position in which we could\nconceive of only one or a few theories that were well confirmed by the\navailable evidence, while subsequent inquiry would routinely (if not\ninvariably) reveal further, radically distinct alternatives as well\nconfirmed by the previously available evidence as those we were\ninclined to accept on the strength of that evidence\u201d (2006, 19).\nIn other words, Stanford claims that in the past we have repeatedly\nfailed to exhaust the space of fundamentally distinct theoretical\npossibilities that were well confirmed by the existing evidence, and\nthat we have every reason to believe that we are probably also failing\nto exhaust the space of such alternatives that are well confirmed by\nthe evidence we have at present. Much of the rest of his case is taken\nup with discussing historical examples illustrating that earlier\nscientists did not simply ignore or dismiss, but instead genuinely\nfailed to conceive of the serious, fundamentally distinct\ntheoretical possibilities that would ultimately come to displace the\ntheories they defended, only to be displaced in turn by others that\nwere similarly unconceived at the time. He concludes that \u201cthe\nhistory of scientific inquiry itself offers a straightforward\nrationale for thinking that there typically are alternatives to our\nbest theories equally well confirmed by the evidence, even when we are\nunable to conceive of them at the time\u201d (2006, 20; for\nreservations and criticisms concerning this line of argument, see\nMagnus 2006, 2010; Godfrey-Smith 2008; Chakravartty 2008; Devitt 2011;\nRuhmkorff 2011; Lyons 2013). Stanford concedes, however, that the\nhistorical record can offer only fallible evidence of a distinctive,\ngeneral problem of contrastive scientific underdetermination, rather\nthan the kind of deductive proof that champions of the case from\nempirical equivalents have typically sought. Thus, claims and\narguments about the various forms that underdetermination may take,\ntheir causes and consequences, and the further significance they hold\nfor the scientific enterprise as a whole continue to evolve in the\nlight of ongoing controversy, and the underdetermination of scientific\ntheory by evidence remains very much a live and unresolved issue in\nthe philosophy of science.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Achinstein, P., 2002, \u201cIs There A Valid Experimental\nArgument for Scientific Realism?\u201d, <em>Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 99: 470\u2013495.", "Bloor, D., 1981 [1976], <em>Knowledge and Social Imagery</em>,\nChicago: University of Chicago, 2nd edition", "Bonk, T., 2008, <em>Underdetermination: An Essay on Evidence and\nthe Limits of Natural Knowledge</em>, Dordrecht, The Netherlands:\nSpringer.", "Belot, G., 2015, \u201cDown to Earth Underdetermination\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, 91:\n455\u2013464.", "Butterfield, J., 2014, \u201cOn Underdetermination in\nCosmology\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern\nPhysics</em>, 46: 57\u201369.", "Carman, C., 2005, \u201cThe Electrons of the Dinosaurs and the\nCenter of the Earth\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of\nScience</em>, 36: 171\u2013174.", "Chakravartty, A., 2008, \u201cWhat You Don\u2019t Know\nCan\u2019t Hurt You: Realism and the Unconceived\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 137: 149\u2013158.", "Cleland, C., 2002, \u201cMethodological and Epistemic Differences\nBetween Historical Science and Experimental Science\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 69: 474\u2013496.", "Collins, H., 1992 [1985], <em>Changing Order: Replication and\nInduction in Scientific Practice</em>, Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress, 2nd edition.", "Currie, A., 2018, <em>Rock, Bone, and Ruin</em>, Cambridge, MA:\nMIT University Press.", "Currie, A. and Sterelny, K., 2017, \u201cIn Defence of\nStory-telling\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of\nScience</em> (Part A), 62: 12\u201321.", "Descartes, R., [1640] 1996, <em>Meditations on First\nPhilosophy</em>, trans. by John Cottingham, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.", "Devitt, M., 2011, \u201cAre Unconceived Alternatives a Problem\nfor Scientific Realism\u201d, <em>Journal for General Philosophy of\nScience</em>, 42: 285\u2013293.", "Duhem, P., [1914] 1954, <em>The Aim and Structure of Physical\nTheory</em>, trans. from 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. by P.
