Practical reason\u2019s first principles\n\nIntelligence and reason are not two powers; \u201creason\u201d and\n\u201creasoning\u201d in a narrow sense can be regarded as the\nextension of one\u2019s \u201cintelligence\u201d (one\u2019s\ncapacity for intelligent insight into the data of experience) into the\npropositional work of reasoning towards judgment, and\n\u201creason\u201d (ratio) in a broader sense refers to\nthis whole capacity, only analytically divisible into aspects or\nphases. So too, practical reason is not a distinct power. Rather,\none\u2019s capacity to think about the way things are can be\n(and naturally, that is effortlessly and normally, is)\n\u201cextended\u201d (Aquinas\u2019 metaphor) to thinking\nintelligently and making reasonable and true judgments about what\nto do. Thinking and judging of the latter kind is practical, that\nis, intends to terminate in choice and action (in Greek\npraxis, in Latin actio). \u201cPractical\nreason\u201d sometimes refers (i) directly to such thinking,\nsometimes (ii) to the propositional content or structure which such\nthinking has when it is done well \u2013 and thus to the propositions\nthat pick out what kinds of action one ought to be judging\npursuit-worthy, undesirable, right, wrong, etc. \u2013 and sometimes\n(iii) to the capacity to engage in such thinking by understanding such\npropositions and being guided by them.\n",
