They were recognized in antiquity\nas the first philosophers and scientists of the Western tradition.\nThis article is a general introduction to the most important\nPresocratic philosophers and the main themes of Presocratic thought.\nMore detailed discussions can be found by consulting the articles on\nthese philosophers (and related topics) in the SEP (listed below).\n\nFor over a century, the standard collection of texts for the\nPresocratics has been that by H. Diels revised by W. Kranz\n(abbreviated as DK). DK provides the original language of the texts,\nusually Greek or Latin, with translation in German. In 2016, a new\ncollection was published by A. Laks and G. Most with original texts\nand translation into English (abbreviated as LM; a version with French\ntranslations was also published in 2016). In DK, each thinker is\nassigned an identifying chapter number (e.g., Heraclitus is 22,\nAnaxagoras 59); then the reports from ancient authors about that\nthinker\u2019s life and thought are collected in a section of\n\u201ctestimonies\u201d (A) and numbered in order, while the\npassages the editors take to be direct quotations are collected and\nnumbered in a section of \u201cfragments\u201d (B). Alleged\nimitations in later authors are sometimes added in a section labeled\nC. Thus, each piece of text can be uniquely identified: DK59B12.3\nidentifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12; DK22A1 identifies\ntestimonium 1 on Heraclitus.\n\nA similar system is adopted in LM. (LM provide helpful concordances to\nDK.) Section P contains passages dealing with the life and works of\nthe author (overlapping in some ways with DK\u2019s A section);\nsection D includes passages covering doctrine with direct quotations\nin boldface font (thus overlapping with DKB and somewhat with DKA);\nand a section R includes reaction to the author (Reception) and texts\nthe editors deem to be ancient forgeries or imitations. Like DK, LM\nassign an identifying number to each thinker and numbers to each piece\nof text: LM25D27 picks out Anaxagoras (25) doctrine number 27 (=\nDK59B12), LM25P37 is the same text as DK59A30, and LM25D94 is DK59A117.\n", "toc": [{"#WhoWerPrePhi": "1.

Who Were the Presocratic Philosophers?\n\nFragmentary evidence complicates our understanding of the\nPresocratics. Most of them wrote at least one \u201cbook\u201d\n(short pieces of prose writing, or, in some cases, poems), but no\ncomplete work survives. Instead, we depend on later philosophers,\nhistorians, and compilers of collections of ancient wisdom for\ndisconnected quotations (fragments) and reports about their views\n(testimonia). In some cases, these sources were themselves\nable to consult the works of the Presocratics directly. In many\nothers, the line is indirect and often depends on the work of Hippias,\nAristotle, Theophrastus, Simplicius, and other ancient philosophers\nwho did have direct access. All of the sources for the fragments and\ntestimonia made selective use of the material available to them, in\naccordance with their own special, and varied, interests in the early\nthinkers. (For analyses of the doxographic tradition, and the\ninfluence of Aristotle and Theophrastus on later sources, see Mansfeld\n1999; Runia 2008; Mansfeld and Runia 1997, 2009a, and 2009b; Laks and\nMost, 2016.) Despite (or perhaps because of) the fragmentary nature of\nthe evidence, new material occasionally comes to light. In 1962\n\u201cThe Derveni Papyrus,\u201d probably dating from the second\npart of the fourth century B.C.E., was discovered in Greece (Betegh\n2004, Janko 2001, Kotwick 2017). It is primarily concerned with Orphic\nreligion, including a commentary on a poem attributed to\nOrpheus. Through the work of scholars to reconstruct and interpret it\n(see Kouremenos, P\u00e1ssoglou, & Tantsanaglou 2006) it has\nbecome clear that the author of the commentary was familiar with the\nphilosophical theories of the time, and the papyrus has proved\nvaluable to the study of early Greek Philosophy (see, for instance\nBetegh 2014a and 2014b, and Betegh & Piano 2019). Further new\nPresocratic material was found in a papyrus from Upper Egypt, now in\nStrasbourg, that contains texts from Empedocles, some already included\nin DK, but also previously unknown lines which have complicated our\nunderstanding of Empedocles\u2019 thought. (See Martin &\nPrimavesi 1999, and Janko 2001, 2005.) Although any account of\nPresocratic thinkers has to be a reconstruction, we should not be\noverly pessimistic about the possibility of reaching a historically\nresponsible understanding of them.\n\nCalling this group Presocratic  raises certain difficulties.\nThe term, coined in the eighteenth century, was made current by\nHermann Diels in the nineteenth, and was meant to mark a contrast\nbetween Socrates who was interested in moral problems, and his\npredecessors, who were supposed to be primarily concerned with\ncosmological and physical speculation. \u201cPresocratic,\u201d if\ntaken strictly as a chronological term, is not accurate, for the last\nof them were contemporaneous with Socrates and even Plato. Moreover,\nseveral of the early Greek thinkers explored questions about ethics\nand the best way to live a human life. The term may also suggest that\nthese thinkers are somehow inferior to Socrates and Plato, of interest\nonly as their predecessors, and its suggestion of archaism may imply\nthat philosophy only becomes interesting when we arrive at the\nclassical period of Plato and Aristotle. Some scholars now\ndeliberately avoid the term, but if we take it to refer to the early\nGreek thinkers who were not influenced by the views of Socrates,\nwhether his predecessors or contemporaries, there is probably no harm\nin using it. (For discussions of the notion of Presocratic philosophy,\nsee Long\u2019s introduction in Long (ed.) 1999, Laks 2006, the articles in\nLaks and Louguet 2002, and Laks 2018.) \n\nA second problem lies in referring to these thinkers as\nphilosophers. That is almost certainly not how they could\nhave described themselves. While it is true that Heraclitus says that\n\u201cthose who are lovers of wisdom must be inquirers into many\nthings\u201d (DK22B35/LM9D40), the word he uses,\nphilosophos, does not have the special sense that it acquires\nin the works of Plato and Aristotle, when the philosopher is\ncontrasted with both the ordinary person and other experts, including\nthe sophist (particularly in Plato), or in the resulting modern sense\nin which we can distinguish philosophy from physics or psychology. Yet\nthe Presocratics certainly saw themselves as set apart from ordinary\npeople and also from others (certain of the poets and historical\nwriters, for example, as we can see from Xenophanes and Heraclitus)\nwho were their predecessors and contemporaries. As the fragment from\nHeraclitus shows, the early Greek philosophers thought of themselves\nas inquirers into many things, and the range of their inquiry was\nvast. They had views about the nature of the world, and these views\nencompass what we today call physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology,\nastronomy, embryology, and psychology (and other areas of natural\ninquiry), as well as theology, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\nIn the earliest of the Presocratics, the Milesians, it can indeed be\ndifficult to discern the strictly philosophical aspects of the views\nin the evidence available to us. Nevertheless, despite the danger of\nmisunderstanding and thus underestimating these thinkers because of\nanachronism, there is an important sense in which it is quite\nreasonable to refer to them as philosophers. That sense is inherent in\nAristotle\u2019s view (see, e.g., Metaphysics I,\nPhysics I, De Anima I, On Generation and\nCorruption I): these thinkers were his predecessors in a\nparticular sort of inquiry, and even though Aristotle thinks that they\nwere all, for one reason or another, unsuccessful and even amateurish,\nhe sees in them a similarity such that he can trace a line of\ncontinuity of both subject and method from their work to his own. The\nquestions that the early Greek philosophers asked, the sorts of\nanswers that they gave, and the views that they had of their own\ninquiries were the foundation for the development of philosophy as it\ncame to be defined in the work of Plato and Aristotle and their\nsuccessors. Perhaps the fundamental characteristic is the commitment\nto explain the world naturalistically, in terms of its own inherent\nprinciples. (For discussions, see Sassi, 2006, 2018.)\n\nBy contrast, consider the 7th century BCE poem of Hesiod,\nhis Theogony (genealogy of the gods). Hesiod tells the\ntraditional story of the Olympian gods, beginning with Chaos, a vague\ndivine primordial entity or condition. From Chaos, a sequence of gods\nis generated, often by sexual congress, but sometimes no cause for\ntheir coming to be is given. The divine figures that thus arise are\noften connected with a part of the physical universe, or with some\naspect of human experience, so his theogony is also a cosmogony (an\naccount of the generation of the world). The divinities (and the\nassociated parts of the world) come to be and struggle violently among\nthemselves; finally Zeus triumphs and establishes and maintains an\norder of power among the others. Hesiod\u2019s world is one in which\nthe major divinities are individuals who behave like super-human\nbeings (Gaia or earth, Ouranos or sky, Cronos \u2014 an unlocated\nregal power, Zeus); some of the others are personified characteristics\n(e.g., Momus, blame; and Dusnomia, lawlessness). For the Greeks, the\nfundamental properties of divinity are immortality (they are not\nsubject to death) and great power (as part of the cosmos or in\nmanaging events), and each of Hesiod\u2019s characters has these\nproperties (even though in the story some are defeated, and seem to be\ndestroyed). Hesiod\u2019s story is like a vast Hollywood-style family\nhistory, with envy, rage, love, and lust all playing important parts\nin the coming-to-be of the world as we know it. The earliest rulers of\nthe universe are violently overthrown by their offspring (Ouranos is\noverthrown by Cronos, Cronos by Zeus). Zeus insures his continued\npower by swallowing his first consort Metis (counsel or wisdom); by\nthis he prevents the predicted birth of rivals and acquires her\nattribute of wisdom (Theogony 886\u2013900). In a second\npoem, Works and Days, Hesiod pays more attention to human\nbeings, telling the story of earlier, greater creatures who died out\nor were destroyed by themselves or Zeus. Humans were created by Zeus,\nare under his power, and are subject to his judgment and to divine\nintervention for either good or ill. Hesiod\u2019s world, like\nHomer\u2019s, is one that is god-saturated, where the gods may\nintervene in all aspects of the world, from the weather to mundane\nparticulars of human life, acting on the ordinary world order, in a\nway that humans, limited as they are by time, location, and narrow\npowers of perception, must accept but cannot ultimately understand.\nThe Presocratics reject this account, instead seeing the world as a\nkosmos, an ordered natural arrangement that is inherently\nintelligible and not subject to supra-natural intervention. A striking\nexample is Xenophanes DK21B32/LM8D9: \u201cAnd she whom they call\nIris, this too is by nature cloud / purple, red, and greeny yellow to\nbehold.\u201d Iris, the rainbow, traditional messenger of the gods,\nis after all, not supra-natural, not a sign from the gods on Olympus\nwho are outside of and immune from the usual world order; rather it\nis, in its essence, colored cloud. (A good discussion of the Hesiodic\nmyths in relation to Presocratic philosophy can be found in McKirahan\n2011. Burkert 2008 surveys influence from the east on the development\nof Presocratic philosophy, especially the myths, astronomy, and\ncosmogony of the Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians.)\n\nCalling the Presocratics philosophers also suggests that they\nshare a certain outlook; an outlook that can be contrasted with that\nof other early Greeks (see Moore 2020). Although scholars disagree\nabout the extent of the divergence between the early Greek\nphilosophers and their non-philosophical predecessors and\ncontemporaries, it is evident that Presocratic thought exhibits a\ndifference not only in its understanding of the nature of the world,\nbut also in its view of the sort of explanation of it that is\npossible. This is clear in Heraclitus. Although Heraclitus asserts\nthat those who love wisdom must be inquirers into many things, inquiry\nalone is not sufficient. At DK22B40/LMD20 he rebukes four of his\npredecessors: \u201cMuch learning does not teach understanding; else\nit would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and\nHecataeus.\u201d Heraclitus\u2019 implicit contrast is with himself;\nin DK 22B1/LM D9 and D110 he suggests that he alone truly understands\nall things, because he grasps the account that enables him to\n\u201cdistinguish each thing in accordance with its nature\u201d and\nsay how it is. For Heraclitus there is an underlying principle that\nunites and explains everything. It is this that others have failed to\nsee and understand. According to Heraclitus, the four have amassed a\ngreat deal of information \u2014 Hesiod was a traditional source of\ninformation about the gods, Pythagoras was renowned for his learning\nand especially views about how one ought to live, Xenophanes taught\nabout the proper view of the gods and the natural world, Hecataeus was\nan early historian \u2014 but because they have failed to grasp the\ndeeper significance of the facts available to them, their unconnected\nbits of knowledge do not constitute understanding. Just as the world\nis a kosmos, an ordered arrangement, so too, human knowledge\nof that world must be ordered in a corresponding way.\n2. The Milesians\n\nIn his account of his predecessors\u2019 searches for \u201ccauses\nand principles\u201d of the natural world and natural phenomena,\nAristotle says that Thales of Miletus (a city in Ionia, on the west\ncoast of what is now Turkey) was the first to engage in such inquiry.\nHe seems to have lived around the beginning of the 6th c.\nBCE. Aristotle mentions that some people, before Thales, placed great\nimportance on water, but he credits Thales with declaring water to be\nthe first cause (Metaphysics 983b27\u201333), and he then\nlater raises the question of whether perhaps Hesiod was the first to\nlook for a cause of motion and change (984b23ff.). These suggestions\nare rhetorical: Aristotle does not seriously imply that those he\nmentions are engaged in the same sort of inquiry as he thinks Thales\nwas. Two other Greek thinkers from this very early period, Anaximander\nand Anaximenes, were also from Miletus, and although the ancient\ntradition that the three were related as master and pupil may not be\ncorrect, there are enough fundamental similarities in their views to\njustify treating them together. \n\nThe tradition claims that Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC\n(DK 11A5/LM 5P9, P10), introduced geometry into Greece from Egypt (DK\n11A11/LM 5P4, P5, R11), and produced some engineering marvels.\nAnaximander is reported to have invented the gnomon (the raised piece\nof a sundial whose shadow marks time); to have created a sphere of the\nheavens serving as an astronomical and cosmological model (DK 12A1/LM\n6P2, P4, P11); and to have been the first to draw a map of the\ninhabited world (DK 12A6/LM 6P6, D4). Regardless of whether these\nreports are correct (and in the case of Thales\u2019 prediction they\nalmost certainly are not), they indicate something important about the\nMilesians: their interests in measuring and explaining celestial and\nterrestrial phenomena were as strong as their concern with the more\nabstract inquiries into the causes and principles of substance and\nchange attributed to them by Aristotle (Algra 1999, White 2002 and\n2008). They did not see so-called \u201cscientific\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d questions as belonging to separate\ndisciplines, requiring distinct methods of inquiry. The assumptions\nand principles that we (along with Aristotle) see as constituting the\nphilosophical foundations of their theories are, for the most part,\nimplicit in the claims that they make. Nevertheless, it is legitimate\nto treat the Milesians as having philosophical views, even though no\nclear statements of these views or specific arguments for them can be\nfound in the surviving fragments and testimonia. \n\nAristotle\u2019s comments do not sound as if they were based on\nfirst-hand knowledge of Thales\u2019 views, and the doxographical\nreports say that Thales did not write a book. Yet Aristotle is\nconfident that Thales belongs, even if honorifically, to that group of\nthinkers that he calls \u201cinquirers into nature\u201d and\ndistinguishes him from earlier poetical \u201cmyth-makers.\u201d In\nBook I of Metaphysics, Aristotle claims that the earliest\nof these, among whom he places the Milesians, explained things only in\nterms of their matter (Met. I.3 983b6\u201318). This claim\nis anachronistic in that it presupposes Aristotle\u2019s own novel\nview that a complete explanation must encompass four factors: what he\ncalled the material, efficient, formal, and final causes. Yet there is\nsomething in what Aristotle says. Aristotle links Thales\u2019 claim\nthat the world rests on water with the view that water was the\narch\u0113, or fundamental principle, and he adds that\n\u201cthat from which they come to be is a principle of all\nthings\u201d (983b24\u201325; DK 11A12/LM 5D3, R9). He suggests that\nThales chose water because of its fundamental role in coming-to-be,\nnutrition, and growth, and claims that water is the origin of the\nnature of moist things. \n\nAristotle\u2019s general assertion about the first thinkers who gave\naccounts of nature (and his specific discussion of Thales\u2019\nreliance on water as a first principle) brings out a difficulty in\ninterpreting the early Presocratics. According to Aristotle\u2019s\ngeneral account, the Presocratics claimed that there was a single\nenduring material stuff that is both the origin of all things and\ntheir continuing nature. Thus, on this view, when Thales says that the\nfirst principle is water, he should be understood as claiming both\nthat the original state of things was water and that even now (despite\nappearances), everything is really water in some state or another. The\nchange from the original state to the present one involves changes in\nthe material stuff such that although it may not now appear to be\nwater everywhere (but seems to be airier or earthier than water in its\nusual state, or its original one), there is no transformation of water\ninto a different kind of stuff (air or earth, for instance). Yet, when\nAristotle comes to give what details he can of Thales\u2019 view, he\nsuggests only that for Thales, water was the first principle because\neverything comes from water. Water, then, was perhaps the original\nstate of things for Thales, and water is a necessary condition for\neverything that is generated naturally, but Aristotle\u2019s summary\nof Thales\u2019 view does not imply that Thales claimed that water\nendures through whatever changes have occurred since the original\nstate, and now just has some new or additional properties. Thales may\nwell have thought that certain characteristics of the original water\npersisted: in particular its capacity for motion (which must have been\ninnate in order to generate the changes from the original state). This\nis suggested by Thales\u2019 reported claims that the lodestone (with\nits magnetic properties) and amber (which when rubbed exhibits powers\nof attraction through static electricity) have souls and that all\nthings are full of gods. Aristotle surmises that Thales identified\nsoul (that which makes a thing alive and thus capable of motion) with\nsomething in the whole universe, and so supposed that everything was\nfull of gods (DK11A22/LM5D10, D11a )\u2014water, or soul, being a\ndivine natural principle. Certainly the claim that the lodestone has\nsoul suggests this account. Given that the analysis of change (both\nqualitative and substantial) in terms of a substratum that gains and\nloses properties is Aristotelian (although perhaps foreshadowed in\nPlato), it is not surprising that the earlier views were unclear on\nthis issue, and it is probable that the Milesian view did not clearly\ndistinguish the notions of an original matter and an enduring\nunderlying stuff (Graham 2006). \n\nThe reports about Thales show him employing a certain kind of\nexplanation: ultimately the explanation of why things are as they are\nis grounded in water as the basic stuff of the universe and the\nchanges that it undergoes through its own inherent nature. In this,\nThales marks a radical change from all other previous sorts of\naccounts of the world (both Greek and non-Greek). Like the other\nPresocratics, Thales sees nature as a complete and self-ordering\nsystem, and sees no reason to call on divine intervention from outside\nthe natural world to supplement his account\u2014water itself may be\ndivine, but it is not something that intervenes in the natural world\nfrom outside (Gregory, 2013). While the evidence for Thales\u2019\nnaturalistic account is circumstantial, this attitude can be directly\nverified for Anaximander. \n\nIn the one fragment that can be securely attributed to Anaximander\n(although the extent of the implied quotation is uncertain), he\nemphasizes the orderly nature of the universe, and indicates that the\norder is internal rather than imposed from outside. Simplicius, a\n6th c. CE commentator on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics, writes: \n\nOf those who say that [the first principle] is one and moving and\nindefinite, Anaximander, son of Praxiades, a Milesian who became\nsuccessor and pupil to Thales, said that the indefinite (to\napeiron) is both principle (arch\u0113) and element\n(stoicheion) of the things that are, and he was the first to\nintroduce this name of the principle. He says that it is neither water\nnor any other of the so-called elements, but some other indefinite\n(apeiron) nature, from which come to be all the heavens and\nthe worlds in them; and those things, from which there is coming-to-be\nfor the things that are, are also those into which is their\npassing-away, in accordance with what must be. For they give penalty\n(dik\u00ea) and recompense to one another for their\ninjustice (adikia) in accordance with the ordering of\ntime\u2014speaking of them in rather poetical terms. It is clear that\nhaving seen the change of the four elements into each other, he did\nnot think it fit to make some one of these underlying subject, but\nsomething else, apart from these. (Simplicius, Commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics 24, lines 13ff. = DK12A9/LM6P5, D6, D12\nand\n DKB1/LM6D6)[1]\n\n\nThus, there is an original (and originating) indefinite stuff, from\nwhich all the heavens and the worlds in them come to be. This claim\nprobably means that the original state of the universe was an\nindefinitely large mass of stuff that was also indefinite in its\n character.[2]\n This stuff then gave rise through its own inherent power to the\ningredients that themselves constitute the world as we perceive it.\n\n\nA testimony about Anaximander from Pseudo-Plutarch (DK12A10/LM6P6, D4)\nsays that \u201cSomething productive of hot and cold was separated\noff from the eternal at the genesis of this world and from this a\nsphere of flame grew around the air around the earth like the bark\naround a tree.\u201d Neither the cause nor the precise process of\nseparation is explained, but it is probable that Anaximander would\nhave thought of motion as innate and so that the original source of\nchange was part of the character of the indefinite itself. The passage\nfrom Simplicius shows that Anaximander does not think that the eternal\nindefinite stuff gives rise directly to the cosmos as we know it.\nRather, relying on a semi-biological model, Anaximander claims that\nthe apeiron somehow generates the opposites hot and cold. Hot\nand cold are themselves stuffs with powers; and it is the actions of\nthese stuffs/powers that produce the things that come to be in our\nworld. The opposites act on, dominate, and contain each other,\nproducing a regulated structure; thus things pass away into those\nthings from which they came to be. It is this structured arrangement\nthat Anaximander refers to when he speaks of justice and reparation.\nOver the course of time, the cycles of the seasons, the rotations of\nthe heavens, and other sorts of cyclical change (including\ncoming-to-be and passing-away) are regulated and thus form a system.\nThis system, ruled by the justice of the ordering of time is in sharp\ncontrast with the chaotic and capricious world of the personified\nGreek gods who interfere in the workings of the heavens and in the\naffairs of human beings (Kahn 1985a, Vlastos 1947, Guthrie 1962). \n\nThe pattern that can be seen in Thales and Anaximander of an original\nstuff giving rise to the phenomena of the cosmos continues in the\nviews of the third of the Milesians, Anaximenes. He replaces\nAnaximander\u2019s apeiron with air, thus eliminating the\nfirst stage of the coming-to-be of the cosmos (the something\nproductive of hot and cold). Rather, he returns to an originating\nstuff more like Thales\u2019 water. In DK13A5/LM7D1 and D7\nAristotle\u2019s associate Theophrastus, quoted by Simplicius,\nspeculates that Anaximenes chose air because he agreed that a basic\nprinciple must be neutral (as Anaximander\u2019s apeiron is)\nbut not so lacking in properties that it seems to be nothing at all.\nAir can apparently take on various properties of color, temperature,\nhumidity, motion, taste, and smell. Moreover, according to\nTheophrastus, Anaximenes explicitly states the natural mechanism for\nchange; it is the condensation and rarefaction of air that naturally\ndetermine the particular characters of the things produced from the\noriginating stuff. Rarified, air becomes fire; more and more\ncondensed, it becomes progressively wind, cloud, water, earth, and\nfinally stones. \u201cThe rest,\u201d says Theophrastus, \u201ccome\nto be from these.\u201d Plutarch says that condensation and\nrarefaction are connected with cooling and heating, and he gives the\nexample of breath (DK13B1/LM7D8,R4). Releasing air from the mouth with\ncompressed lips produces cool air (as in cooling soup by blowing on\nit), but relaxed lips produce warm air (as when one blows on cold\nhands to warm them up). \n\nDoes the originating stuff persist through the changes that it\nundergoes in the generating processes? Aristotle\u2019s account\nsuggests that it does, that Anaximenes, for instance, would have\nthought that stone was really air, although in an altered state, just\nas we might say that ice is really water, cooled to a point where it\ngoes from a liquid to a solid state. Because the water does not cease\nto be water when it is cooled and becomes ice, it can return to a\nliquid when heated and then become a gas when more heat is applied. On\nthis view, the Milesians were material monists, committed to the\nreality of a single material stuff that undergoes many alterations but\npersists through the changes (Barnes 1979, Guthrie 1962, Sedley 2007\nand 2009). Yet there are reasons to doubt that this was actually the\nMilesian view. It presumes that the early Greek thinkers anticipated\nAristotle\u2019s general theory that change requires enduring\nunderlying substances that gain and lose properties. The earliest\nGreeks thought more in terms of powers (Vlastos 1947, Heidel 1906),\nand the metaphysical problem of what it is to be a substance was yet\nto be formulated. Clearly the Milesians were interested in the\noriginating stuff from which the world developed (Anaximander and\nAnaximenes are explicit about transformations of such an eternal\noriginating stuff), but the view that this endured as a single\nsubstratum may not have been theirs. Rather, it has been suggested by\nGraham (1997 and 2006; Mourelatos 2008) that the Milesians were not,\nin Aristotle\u2019s sense, material monists. On this view, the\noriginal/originating stuff is transformed into other substances.\nAnaximenes, for instance, may have thought that the change from air to\nwater does not involve the persistence of air as any sort of\nsubstratum. There is no special role that air plays in the theory\nexcept that it is the originating stuff and so first in an analysis of\nthe law-like cyclical changes that produce various stuffs as the\ncosmos develops (Graham 2006, ch. 4). Such an interpretation suggests\nhow different the Milesian conception of the world is from\nAristotle\u2019s.\n3. Xenophanes of Colophon and Heraclitus of Ephesus\n\nLiving in the last years of the 6th c. and the beginning of\nthe 5th, Xenophanes and Heraclitus continue the Milesian\ninterest in the nature of the physical world, and both offer\ncosmological accounts; yet they go further than the Milesians not only\nthrough their focus on the human subject and the expanded range of\ntheir physical explanations, but by investigating the nature of\ninquiry itself. Both explore the possibility of human understanding\nand question its limits. Recent work on Xenophanes\u2019 epistemology\nand his cosmology has made much of his scientific work clearer and\nmore impressive (Lesher 1992, Mourelatos 2008). He has, to a great\nextent, been rescued from his traditional status as a minor traveling\npoet-sage who railed against the glorification of athletes and made\nsome interesting comments about the relativity of human conceptions of\nthe gods. Instead, he has come to be seen as an original thinker in\nhis own right who influenced later philosophers trying to characterize\nthe realms of the human and the divine, and exploring the possibility\nthat human beings can gain genuine knowledge and wisdom, i.e., are\nable to have a god\u2019s eye view of things and understand them\n(Curd 2013, Mogyor\u00f3di 2002 and 2006). \n\nXenophanes claims that all meteorological phenomena are clouds,\ncolored, moving, incandescent: rainbow, St. Elmo\u2019s Fire, the\nsun, the moon. Clouds are fed by exhalations from the land and sea\n(mixtures of earth and water). The motions of earth and water, and\nhence of clouds, account for all the things we find around us. His\nexplanations of meteorological and heavenly phenomena lead to a\nnaturalistic science:\n\n\nShe whom they call Iris, this too is by nature (pephuke)\ncloud\n\npurple, and red, and greeny-yellow to behold. (DK21B32/LM8D39)\n\nXenophanes says that the star-like phenomena seen when aboard ship,\nwhich some call the Dioscuri, are cloudlets, glimmering because of\ntheir kind of motion. (DkA39/LM8D38)\n\n\nIn the 1980\u2019s Alexander Mourelatos argued that Xenophanes\nemploys an important new pattern of explanation: X is really\nY, where Y reveals the true character of X.\nXenophanes signals this by the use of pephuke in\nDK21B32/LM8D39, and no doubt it (or some word like it) was there in\nthe original of DKA39/LMD36 as well. Xenophanes thus provides an\naccount of a phenomenon often taken to be a sign from the\ndivine\u2014Iris as the messenger; the Dioscuri (St. Elmo\u2019s\nfire) as comfort for sailors\u2014that reduces it to a natural\noccurrence. \n\nThat meteorological phenomena are not divine is not all that\nXenophanes has to say about the gods. He notes anthropomorphic\ntendencies in conceptions of the gods (DKB14/LMD12: \u201cMortals\nsuppose that the gods are born, and have their own dress, voice, and\nbody;\u201d DKB16/LMD13: \u201cEthiopians say that their gods are\nsnub-nosed and dark, Thracians, that theirs are grey-eyed and\nred-haired\u201d). He also famously suggests that horses, oxen, and\nlions would have equine, bovine, and leonine gods (DKB15/LM14). Yet\nXenophanes also makes positive claims about the nature of the divine,\nincluding the claim that there is a single greatest god:\n\nOne god greatest among gods and men,\n\nResembling mortals neither in body nor in thought.\n\n\u2026 whole [he] sees, whole [he] thinks, and whole [he] hears,\n\nbut completely without toil he agitates all things by the\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0thought of his mind.\n\n\u2026 always he remains in the same (state), agitated not at all,\n\nnor is it fitting that he come and go to different places at different\ntimes. (DK B23, B24, B25, B26 / LM D16, 17, 18, 19)\n\n\nWhile indifferent to the affairs of human beings, Xenophanes\u2019\ndivine being comprehends and controls a cosmos that is infused with\nthinking: it is understood, organized, and managed by divine\nintellection. Having removed the gods as bearers of knowledge to\nhumans, and denied that the divine takes an active interest in what\nmortals can or cannot know, Xenophanes asserts the conclusion to be\ndrawn from his naturalistic interpretation of phenomena: the gods are\nnot going to reveal anything to us; we are epistemologically\nautonomous and must rely on our own capacity for inquiry. That way, we\n\u201cdiscover better,\u201d as he says in DKB18/LMD53, a fragment\nthat is optimistic about the capacities of human intelligence (see\nLesher 1991):\n\nIndeed not even from the beginning did the gods indicate all things to\nmortals, but, in time, inquiring, they discover better.\n\n\nThis suggests that human thought can mimic divine understanding, at\nleast to some degree. Xenophanes\u2019 own practice seems consistent\nwith the claims of DKB18/LMD53; his own inquiries and explanations led\nhim to unified explanations of terrestrial and celestial phenomena.\nYet DKB34/LMD49 suggests skepticism: \n\nAnd of course the clear and certain truth no man has seen,\n\nnor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about\nall things;\n\nfor even if, in the best case, he should chance to speak what is the\ncase,\n\nall the same, he himself does not know; but opinion is found over all.\n\n\nWhether this is global or limited skepticism is controversial (Lesher\n1992 and 1994 argues for a limited interpretation). Xenophanes\nstresses the difficulty of coming to certainty, particularly about\nthings beyond our direct experience. Nonetheless, in DKB35/LMD50 (a\ntantalizingly short fragment), Xenophanes says, \u201cLet these thing\nbe accepted to be like the truth\u201d (see Bryan 2012 for a full\ndiscussion).\n\nFamously obscure, accused by Plato of incoherence and by Aristotle of\ndenying the law of non-contradiction, Heraclitus writes in an\naphoristic style. His apparently paradoxical claims present\ndifficulties to any interpreter. Nevertheless, he raises important\nquestions about knowledge and the nature of the world. The opening of\nHeraclitus\u2019 book refers to a \u201clogos which holds\n forever.\u201d[3]\n There is disagreement about exactly what Heraclitus meant by using\nthe term logos, but it is clear from DK22B1/LM9D1, D110, and\nR86 and DKB2/LM9D2 as well as DKB50/LMD46 and other fragments that he\nrefers to an objective law-like principle that governs the cosmos, and\nwhich it is possible (but difficult) for humans to come to understand.\nThere is a single order that directs all things (\u201call things are\none\u201d DKB50/LMD46); this order is divine, and is sometimes\nconnected by humans with the traditional gods (it is \u201cboth\nunwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus\u201d\nDKB32/LMD45). Just as Zeus, in the traditional view, controls\neverything from Olympus with a thunderbolt, so this single ordered\nsystem also steers and controls the whole cosmos, but from within. The\nsign of the unchanging order of the eternal system is fire\u2014just\nas fire is always changing and always the same, the logos,\nitself permanent, contains the unchanging account that explains the\nalterations and transformations of the cosmos.\n\nThis plan or order that steers the cosmos is, itself, a rational\norder. This means not only that it is non-capricious and so\nintelligible (in the sense that humans can, at least in principle,\ncome to understand it), it is also an intelligent system: there is an\nintelligent plan at work, if only in the sense of the cosmos working\nitself out in accordance with rational\n principles.[4]\n Consider DKB114/LMD105:\n\nThose who would speak with understanding must ground themselves firmly\nin that which is common to all, just as a city does in its law, and\neven more firmly! For all human laws are nourished by one law, the\ndivine; for it rules as far at it wishes and suffices for all, and is\nstill more than enough.\n\n\nHeraclitus is not only claiming that human prescriptive law must\nharmonize with divine law, but he is also asserting that divine law\nencompasses both the universal laws of the cosmos itself and the\nparticular laws of humans. The cosmos itself is an intelligent,\neternal (and hence divine) system that orders and regulates itself in\nan intelligent way: the logos is the account of this\nself-regulation. We can come to grasp and understand at least part of\nthis divine system. This is not merely because we ourselves are part\nof (contained in) the system, but because we have, through our\ncapacity for intelligent thinking, the power to grasp the system as a\nwhole, through knowing the logos. How this grasping is\nsupposed to work is tantalizingly obscure. \n\nHeraclitus regards the cosmos as an ordered system like a language\nthat can be read or heard and understood by those who are attuned to\nit. That language is not just the physical evidence around us\n(\u201cEyes and ears are bad witnesses to those with barbarian\nsouls\u201d DKB107/LMD33); the sheer accumulation of information is\nnot the same as wisdom (see the rebuke in DK22B40/LMD20, quoted\nabove). Although the evidence of the senses is important (see\nDKB55/LMD31),\ncareful and thoughtful inquiry is also necessary. Those who are lovers\nof wisdom must be good inquirers into many things (DKB35/LMD40; also\nDKB101/LM36: \u201cI enquired into myself\u201d) and must be able to\ngrasp how the phenomena are signs or evidence of the larger order; as\nHeraclitus notes in DKB123/LMD35, \u201cnature is accustomed to hide\nitself,\u201d and the evidence must be interpreted carefully. That\nevidence is the interplay of opposing states and forces, which\nHeraclitus points to by claims about the unity of opposites and the\nroles of strife in human life as well as in the cosmos. There are\nfragments that proclaim the unity or identity of opposites: the road\nup and down are one and the same (DKB60/LMD51), the path of writing is\nboth straight and crooked (DKB59/LMD52), sea water is very pure and\nvery foul (DKB61/LMD78). The famous river fragments (DKB49a/LMR9;\nDKB12/LMD65a, D102; DKB91a not in LM) question the identity of things\nover time, while a number of fragments point to the relativity of\nvalue judgments (DKB9, B82, B102 / LM D79, D81, D73).\nAnaximander\u2019s orderly arrangement of just reciprocity governed\nby time is replaced by a system ruled by what Heraclitus calls war:\n\u201cIt is right to know that war is common and justice strife, and\nthat all things come to be through strife and are so ordained\u201d\n(DKB80/LMD63). This strife or war is the set of changes and\nalterations that constitute the processes of the cosmos. These changes\nare regular and capable of being understood by one who can speak the\nlanguage of the logos and thus interpret it properly (see\nLong 2009). Although the evidence is confusing, it points to the\ndeeper regularities that constitute the cosmos, just as\nHeraclitus\u2019 own remarks can seem obscure yet point to the truth.\nHeraclitus surely has his own message (and his delivery of it) in mind\nin DKB93/LM41, \u201cThe lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither\nspeaks nor conceals, but gives a sign.\u201d \n\nOne of the earliest of the Greek philosophers to discuss the human\nsoul, Heraclitus\u2019 claims about it, like his other views, are\nexpressed enigmatically. Yet it seems fairly clear that he treats soul\nas the seat of emotion, movement, and intellect. DKB107/LMD33 (quoted\nabove) indicates that understanding is a function of soul, and in\nDKB117/LMD104, the drunken man who must be led by a boy because he has\nlost control of his legs, and does not know where he goes or what he\ndoes. Drunkenness is the cause of all this: because his soul has\nbecome wet its powers are dampened down and become ineffective.\nDKB118/LMD103 asserts \u201cgleam of light: dry soul, wisest and\nbest\u201d (there is some uncertainty about the text). This suggests\nthat for Heraclitus, soul is a stuff that is affected by changes along\nthe hot/cold and wet/dry continua and that the a fiery, i.e., hotter\nsoul is best. Indeed in DKB36/LMD100, soul is listed as one of the\nstages of transformation of the cosmic stuffs: \u201cit is death to\nsouls to become water, and to water death to become earth; from earth\nwater comes to be, from from water, soul.\u201d Although Heraclitus\nsays that it is only divine nature that has complete understanding\n(DKB78/LMD74), his linking of fire with the logos and the\ndivine, along with his view that the best and wisest soul is hot and\ndry, suggests that humans who care for their souls and search for the\ntruth contained in the\nlogos can overcome human ignorance and approach the\nunderstanding that Heraclitus himself has obtained. (Betegh 2007,\n2009, 2013b and Dilcher 1995 discuss the nature and importance of soul\nfor Heraclitus; see also Granger 2000 and Kahn 1979.)\n4. Parmenides of Elea\n\nParmenides, born ca. 510 BCE in the Greek colony of Elea in southern\nItaly (south of Naples, and now known as Velia), explores the nature\nof philosophical inquiry, concentrating less on the contents of knowledge or\nunderstanding (although he has views about these) than on what sort of thing can be\nunderstood. Xenophanes identified genuine knowledge with the grasping\nof the sure and certain truth and claimed that \u201cno man has\nseen\u201d it, at least with respect to some topics (DK21B34/LM8D49);\nHeraclitus had asserted that divine nature, not human, has right\nunderstanding (DK22B78/LM9D74), although he implies that some humans\ncan acquire divine-like understanding. Parmenides argues that human\nthought can reach genuine knowledge or understanding, and that there\nare certain marks or signs that act as guarantees that the goal of\nknowledge has been reached. A fundamental part of Parmenides\u2019\nclaim is that what must be (cannot not-be, as Parmenides puts\nit) is more knowable than what is merely contingent (what may or may\nnot be), which can be the object only of belief. \n\nParmenides gives us a poem in Homeric hexameters, narrating the\njourney of a young man (a kouros, in Greek) who is taken to\nmeet a goddess who promises to teach him \u201call things\u201d\n(DK28B1/LM19D4). The content of the story the goddess tells is not the\nknowledge that will allow humans, by having it, to know. Rather, the\ngoddess gives the kouros the tools to acquire that knowledge\nhimself:\n\nIt is right that you learn all things,\n\nBoth the unshaking heart of well-persuasive truth,\n\nand the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust.\n\nBut nevertheless, you shall learn these things too, how it were right\nthat the things that seem be reliably, being indeed the whole of\nthings. (DKB1.28\u201332/LMD4.28\u201332; the last two lines text are uncertain.)\n\n\nThe goddess does not provide the kouros with a list of true\npropositions, as a body of knowledge for him to acquire, and false\nones to be avoided. Rather, in teaching him how to evaluate claims\nabout what-is, the goddess unleashes the kouros\u2019 own\ncognitive powers to know everything, by testing and evaluation,\naccepting or rejecting claims about the ultimate nature of\nthings\u2014 for that alone is capable of being known. For\nParmenides, the mark of what is known is that it is something that\ngenuinely is, with no taint of what-is-not. That is why, for him,\nwhat-is not only is, but must be and cannot not-be. He sets this out\nin the key passages of DKB2 and\n B3/LM19D6:[5]\n\nCome now, and I will tell you, and you, hearing, preserve the story,\n\nthe only routes of inquiry there are for thinking;\n\nthe one that it is and that it cannot not be\n\nis the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon truth)\n\nthe other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,\n\nthis I point out to you is a path wholly inscrutable\n\nfor you could not know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)\n\nnor could you point it out\u2026 For the same thing is for thinking\nand for being.\n\n\nThe routes are methods of inquiry: keeping on the correct route will\nbring one to what-is, the real object of thought and understanding.\nAlthough what the goddess tells the kouros has divine\nsanction (hers), that is not why he should accept it. Rather, the\ntruth she tells reveals a mark of its own truth: it is testable by\nreason or thought itself. In DKB7/LMD8 the goddess warns that we must\ncontrol our thought in the face of the ever-present seductions of\nsense-experience:\n\nFor never shall this be forced through: that things that are not are;\n\nbut restrain your thought from this route of inquiry,\n\nnor let much-experienced habit force you along this path,\n\nto ply an aimless eye and resounding ear\n\nand tongue, but judge by reasoning (logos) the much-battled\ntesting\n\nspoken by me.\n\n\nThe kouros himself can reach a decision or determination of\nthe truth solely through use of his logos. Logos\nhere means thinking or reasoning (Parmenides probably means the human\ncapacity for thought in general). The test (restated at\nB8.15\u201316/LMD8.20\u201321, is \u201cis or is not?\u201d This\nis not just a question of non-contradiction (which would give us\ncoherence), but an inquiry whether or not the supposition that\nsomething is would entail, on further examination, the reality of\nwhat-is-not (which is impossible). \n\nThe arguments of DKB8/LMD8 demonstrate how what-is must be.\nIn applying these arguments as tests against any suggested basic\nentity in the Presocratic search for ultimate causes or principles,\nthe kouros can determine whether or not a proposed theory is\nacceptable. For Parmenides noos is not itself an infallible\ncapacity. One can think well or badly; correct thinking is that which\ntakes the correct route and so reaches what-is. The mortals on the\nincorrect route are thinking, but their thoughts have no real object\n(none that is real in the appropriate way), and so cannot be completed\nor perfected by reaching the truth. In B8 Parmenides sets out the\ncriteria for the being of what-is, and then the arguments for those\ncriteria:\n\n\u2026 a single account still\n\nremains of the route that it is; and on this route there are\n\nvery many signs, that what-is is ungenerable and imperishable,\n\na whole of a single kind, and unshaking and complete;\n\nnor was it nor will it be, since it is now all together\n\none, cohesive. (DKB8.1\u20136/LMD8.6\u201311)\n\n\nAny thing that genuinely is cannot be subject to coming-to-be or\npassing-away, must be of a single nature, and must be complete, in the\nsense of being unchangeably and unalterably what it is. These are\nsigns for what any ultimate cause or principle must be like, if it is\nto be satisfactory as a principle, as something that can be known. The\nsigns are adverbial, showing how what-is is (Mourelatos 2008). Only an\nentity which is in the complete way can be grasped and understood in\nits entirety by thought. McKirahan (2008) provides a thorough analysis\nof the arguments of DKB8/LMD8, as do Palmer (2009) and Graham\n(2010).\n\nAfter laying out the arguments about what-is, the goddess turns to the\nroute of mortals, in an account which she calls\n\u201cdeceptive.\u201d Although Parmenides has been read as thus\nrejecting any possibility of cosmological inquiry (Barnes 1979, Owen\n1960), there are forceful interpretations that allow for justified\nbelief about the contingent world, a world that may or may not be, and\nis not such that it must be (Nehamas 2002, Curd 2004, Palmer 2009).\nThe problem of mortals is that they mistake what they perceive for\nwhat there is (and must be). As long as one realizes that the world of\nperception is not genuinely real, and cannot therefore be the object\nof knowledge, it may be possible for there to be justified belief\nabout the cosmos. Some details of Parmenides\u2019 own cosmology are\ngiven, arguably as justified belief, in the Doxa section of\nthe poem, and more in the testimonia from later authors. Parmenides\nseems to have been the first Presocratic to claim that the moon gets\nits light from from the sun and that the earth is spherical. Recently\nscholars have focused on these claims about the natural world, and\nhave argued that Parmenides should be understood as offering an\naccount of appearances that can and should be deemed acceptable\n(Palmer 2009, Cordero 2010, Graham 2013, Mourelatos 2013, Bryan 2012,\nJohansen 2016). Nevertheless, Parmenides marks a sharp distinction\nbetween being (what-is and must be) and becoming, and between\nknowledge and perception-based belief or opinion.\n5. The Pythagorean Tradition\n\nIn the last quarter of the sixth century, before Parmenides\u2019\nbirth, Pythagoras of Samos (an Aegean island) arrived in Croton, in\nsouthern Italy. He established a community of followers who adopted\nhis political views, which favored rule by the \u201cbetter\npeople,\u201d and also the way of life he recommended on what seem to\nhave been more or less philosophical bases. The traditional view has\nbeen that the aristocracy, the \u201cbetter people,\u201d generally\nmeant the rich. But Burkert notes that as early as the 4th\nc. BCE there were two traditions about Pythagoras, one that meshes\nwith the traditional view and associates Pythagoras with political\ntyrants, and another that credits him with rejecting tyrannies for\naristocracies that might not have been grounded in wealth (Burkert\n1972, 119). The Pythagorean Archytas (born late 5th\ncentury) lived in a democracy (Tarentum in southern Italy), and seems\nto have argued for fair and proportionate dealings between rich and\npoor (Huffman 2005). The Pythagorean way of life included adherence to\ncertain prescriptions including religious rites and dietary\nrestrictions (there is a general discussion in Kahn 2001). Detailed\ntreatment of Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism can be found in Zhmud (2012\nand 2013); an excellent collection of articles on Pythagoreanism is in\nHuffman (ed.) 2014. \n\nLike Socrates, Pythagoras wrote nothing himself, but had a great\ninfluence on those who followed him. He had a reputation for great\nlearning and wisdom (see Empedocles DKD31B129/LM22.D38, R43), although\nhe was treated satirically by both Xenophanes (DK21B7/LM8.D64) and\nHeraclitus (DK22B40/LM9D20, DKB129/LMD26). We do not know to what\nextent this included knowledge of mathematics, as would be suggested\nby the attribution to him of the famous Pythagorean theorem of\ngeometry (Rowett 2013). The details of Pythagoras\u2019 views are\nunclear, but he seems to have advocated the reincarnation of the soul\n(a novel idea among the Greeks, also developed in Orphic religion) and\nthe possibility of the transmigration of the human soul after death\ninto other animal forms. Pythagorean writers after his own time\nstressed the mathematical structure and order of the universe. This is\noften attributed directly to Pythagoras, but recent scholarship has\nshown that the evidence for attributing this mathematically-based\ncosmology to Pythagoras himself is convoluted and doubtful (Burkert\n1972, Huffman 1993 and 2005; but see Zhmud 1997). \n\nWhat seems clear is that the early Pythagoreans conceived of nature as\na structured system ordered by number (see the entry on\n  Pythagoras), and that such \npost-Parmenidean Pythagoreans as Philolaus\n(last half of the 5th century, more than a generation after\nPythagoras\u2019 death) and Archytas (late 5th to early\n4th century) held more complicated views about the relation\nbetween mathematics and cosmology than it is reasonable to suppose\nPythagoras himself could have advanced. The Pythagorean tradition thus\nincludes two strains. There are reports of a split in the period after\nPythagoras\u2019 death between what we would term the more\nphilosophically inclined Pythagoreans and others who primarily adopted\nthe Pythagorean ethical, religious and political attitudes. The\nlatter, called the acusmatici, followed the Pythagorean\nprecepts, or acusmata (which means \u201cthings\nheard\u201d). The former, the philosophical Pythagoreans (including\nPhilolaus and Archytas), were the so-called mathematici, and\nwhile they recognized that the acusmatici were indeed\nPythagoreans by virtue of accepting Pythagorean precepts, they claimed\nthat they themselves were the true followers of Pythagoras.\n\nPhilolaus of Croton seems to have blended the Pythagorean life with an\nawareness of and appreciation for the arguments of Parmenides (Huffman\n1993). According to Philolaus, \u201cNature in the cosmos was fitted\ntogether out of unlimiteds and limiters\u201d (DK44B1/LM12D2). These\nlimiters and unlimiteds play the role of Parmenidean basic\nrealities\u2014they are and unchangingly must be what they are, and\nso can be known; they are joined together in a harmonia (literally, a\ncarpenter\u2019s joint; metaphorically, a harmony), and \u201cit was\nnot possible for any of the things that are and are known by us to\ncome to be, without the existence of the being of things from which\nthe cosmos was put together\u201d (DK44B6/LM12D5, D14). The\nunlimiteds are unstructured stuffs and continua; the limiters impose\nstructure (shape, form, mathematical structure) on the unlimiteds.\nThings become knowable because they are structured in this way; the\nstructure can apparently be expressed in a numerical ratio that allows\nfor understanding: \u201cAll things that are known have number; for\nwithout this nothing whatever could possibly be thought of or\nknown\u201d (DK44B4/LMD7). Philolaus also developed a theory of the\ncosmos that displaced the earth from the center, replaced by what he\ncalled Hestia, the central fire (Graham 2013, 2014), and offered novel\naccounts of eclipses. \n6. Other Eleatics: Zeno and Melissus\n\nParmenides had argued that there were strict metaphysical requirements\non any object of knowledge; the later Eleatics (named for following\nParmenidean doctrines rather than for strictly geographical reasons),\nZeno of Elea (born ca. 490) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440),\nextended and explored the consequences of his arguments. Zeno paid\nparticular attention to the contrast between the requirements of\nlogical argument and the evidence of the senses (Vlastos 1967 is a\nmasterly treatment of Zeno; see also McKirahan 1999 and 2005). The\nfour famous paradoxes of motion, for which he is now and in antiquity\nbest known, purported to show that, despite the evidence all around\nus, the ordinary motion of everyday experience is impossible. The\nparadoxes claim that motions can never be begun (the Achilles) or be\ncompleted (the Dichotomy), entail contradictions (the Moving Blocks),\nor are altogether impossible (the\n Arrow).[6]\n Recent philosophers of space and time (see Gr\u00fcnbaum 1967,\narticles in Salmon 2001, Huggett 1999, and the entry on \n  Zeno\u2019s Paradoxes) hold that\n the arguments are reductios of the theses that\nspace and time are continuous (the Achilles and the Dichotomy) or\ndiscrete (the Moving Blocks and the Arrow). Consider the Dichotomy: a\nrunner can never complete a run from point A to point B. First, the\nrunner must move from A to a point halfway between A and B (call it\nC). But between A and C there is yet another halfway point (D), and\nthe runner must first reach D. But between A and D there is yet\nanother halfway point \u2026 and so on, ad infinitum. So the runner,\nstarting at A, can never reach B. The argument assumes that it is\nimpossible to pass an infinite number of points in a finite time.\nSimilarly, Zeno produced paradoxes showing that plurality is\nimpossible: if things are many, contradictions follow (Plato\u2019s\nParmenides 127e1ff.; Zeno in DK29B1/LM20D5, D6;\nDK29B2/LM20D7, R6; and DK29B3/LM20D11); there were also purported\nproofs that place is impossible (DK29A24/LM20D13a, R22, R23) and that\nthings cannot have parts (the Millet Seed, DK29A29/LM20D12a, D12b,\nR16).\n\nMelissus, dismissed as a simple-minded thinker by Aristotle (and by\nsome contemporary scholars as well but see Makin 2005), expands\nParmenides\u2019 arguments about the nature of what-is (Palmer 2004).\nIt is Melissus who explicitly claims that only one thing can be: if\nwhat-is is unlimited (as he thinks it is), it must be one and all\nalike (if there were two [in number or in character] they would be\n\u201climited against each other\u201d DK30B6/LM21D6). Melissus\nspecifically argues against the empty (the void), and rejects the\npossibility of rearrangement (which would allow for the appearance of\ncoming-to-be and passing-away, and of movement)\u2014all these\ncharacteristics are incompatible with the unity of what-is (i.e., the\nOne). Melissus thus claims that what is real is completely unlike the\nworld that we experience: the split between appearance and reality is\ncomplete and unbridgeable.\n7. The Pluralists: Anaxagoras of Clazomenae and Empedocles of Acragas\n\nWhile Zeno and Melissus reinforced Parmenides\u2019 distinction\nbetween what-is (i.e., what must be) and what appears, other\npost-Parmenidean thinkers accepted Parmenides\u2019 arguments against\ncoming-to-be and passing-away (as characterizing what-is), and about\nthe stable nature of what is ultimately real, and argued that these\narguments did not rule out the possibility of metaphysically-based (or\nrational) cosmology. Both Anaxagoras and Empedocles worked within the\nParmenidean pattern while developing distinct cosmological systems\nthat addressed their own particular concerns (especially in the case\nof Empedocles, concerns about the proper way to live). \n\nAnaxagoras (writing in the mid-5th c.) claims, \u201cThe\nGreeks [i.e., ordinary people] do not think correctly about\ncoming-to-be and passing-away; for no thing comes to be or passes\naway, but is mixed together and dissociated from the things that are.\nAnd thus they would be correct to call coming-to-be mixing-together\nand passing-away dissociating\u201d (DK59B17/LM25D15). What seem to\nbe generated objects (human beings, plants, animals, the moon, the\nstars) are instead temporary mixtures of ingredients (such as earth,\nair, fire, water, hair, flesh, blood, dense, dark, rare, bright, and\nso on). Recent treatments of Anaxagoras (Marmodoro 2015, 2017) have\nsuggested that the ingredients are primarily powers that manifest\nthemselves in the mixtures\n produced.[7]\n The original state was universal mixture: \u201cAll things were\ntogether, unlimited both in amount and in smallness, for the small,\ntoo, was unlimited. And because all things were together, nothing was\nevident\u201d (DK59B1/LM25D9). This mixture is set into rotary motion\nby the operation of Mind (Nous \u2013 DK59B12/LM25D27,\nDKB13/LM25DD29b, DK59B14/LM25D28; see discussions in Laks 1993, Lesher\n1995, Menn 1995, Curd 2007), a separate cosmic entity that does not\nshare in such mixture. As the rotation spreads out through the\nunlimited mass of indistinguishably intermingled ingredients, the\nrotation causes a winnowing or separating effect, and the cosmos as we\nknow it emerges from the mixture. Moreover, not only were all\nthings together, they are even now all together, in a\ndifferent way, despite the differentiations now achieved. Everything\nis in everything (DK59B5, B6, B11/LM25D16, D25, D26), in some proportions, however small\nor great \u2013 this is a move to prevent even the appearance of\ncoming-to-be from what-is-not. \n\nAnaxagoras marks an important theoretical step in attributing the\nmotion of his ingredients to an independent, intelligent force\n(although both Plato and Aristotle were disappointed that his theory\nwas not properly\u2014from their point of view\u2014teleological; on\nthis see Sedley 2007, Curd 2018). The rotation begun by Mind is\ncausally responsible for the formation of the heavens and the\nactivities of the great masses of the earth and the water on the\nearth, as well as all meteorological phenomena. Insofar as the causes\nof the operations of the heavens and the phenomena apparent to us from\nday to day are the same at both the macro- and micro-level (the\nrotations that cause the apparent motions of the stars are the same as\nthose that govern the cycles of weather and life and death on earth),\nwe can infer the nature of what is real from what is apparent\n(Anaxagoras\u2019 scientific views are treated in Graham 2006 and\n2013). Although we do not perceive all things as being together, and\nthe move to the ultimate explanations is an inference, it is a\nlegitimate one (\u201cowing to their [the senses\u2019] feebleness,\nwe are not able to determine the truth\u201d yet \u201cappearances\nare a sight of the unseen\u201d DK59B21/LM25D5 and\nDK59B21a/LM25D6).\n\nA younger contemporary of Anaxagoras, Empedocles, who lived in Sicily,\nalso recognized the force of Parmenides\u2019 arguments against\ncoming-to-be and passing-away. (Empedocles also adopts\nParmenides\u2019 poetic meter in order to tell his story.) Empedocles\nproposes a cosmos formed of the four roots (as he calls them), earth,\nwater, air, and fire along with the motive forces of Love and Strife.\nIt is often claimed that, for Empedocles, Love simply produces mixture\nand Strife only causes separation. Empedocles\u2019 view is more\ncomplicated, for both forces mix and separate. Love unites opposed\n(unlike) things by pulling apart and then mixing these unlikes, while\nStrife sets unlikes in opposition and segregates them, hence Strife\nmixes like with like. Just as painters can produce fantastically\nlifelike scenes just by mixing colors, so the operations of Love and\nStrife, using just the four roots can produce \u201ctrees and men and\nwomen, and beasts and birds and water-nourished fish, and long-lived\ngods best in honors\u201d (31B17). These are the things that\nEmpedocles calls \u201cmortal,\u201d and he even provides recipes.\nDK31B73/LM22D73 tells how Kypris (the goddess Aphrodite, i.e. love)\nfashions shapes (or kinds): \u201cshe moistened earth in rain, and\ngave it to quick fire to harden.\u201d DK31B96/LM44D192 gives a\nrecipe for bones; flesh and blood both have the same recipe (earth,\nwater, air, and fire in equal proportions), but differ in the\nrefinement of the mixture (DK31B98/LM44D58a and D190). \n\nLike the other Presocratics, Empedocles has a cosmological theory, in\nhis case, an unending cycle involving the competition between Love and\nStrife. Love overcomes the separating influence of Strife, bringing\ntogether unlikes and so preventing the clinging together of likes. The\ntriumph of Love results in the Sphere, which is a complete mixture\nbecause the four unlike roots are as mixed (integrated) as possible.\nStrife breaks up the sphere by beginning to attract like to like and\nso pulling the mixture apart, until, when it triumphs, there is\ncomplete segregation of the roots. Love resists the separation of\nunlikes and the clinging together of likes, by trying to keep unlike\nthings mixed. The cosmos as we know it is a result of intermediate\nphases between the two extremes of the triumph of one of the\n forces.[8]\n\n\nAlthough Empedocles gives an account of the cosmos, cosmology is not\nhis sole interest. Both fragments and testimonia show his keen\nattention to questions about perception and its role in knowledge, the\nworkings of the body, and psychology. Like the Pythagoreans,\nEmpedocles thought that how one lived was as important as one\u2019s\ntheoretical commitments (and that the two were intimately connected).\nThe ancient evidence seems to suggest that Empedocles was the author\nof two works, commonly called in modern scholarship the\nPhysics and the Purifications, one cosmological and\nthe other ethico-religious. The relation between the two works has\nbeen a matter of some controversy. In the 1990s important new evidence\nfrom the Strasbourg Papyrus showed unequivocally that the cosmological\nand ethico-religious aspects of Empedocles\u2019 thought are\ninextricably intertwined (Martin and Primavesi 1999, Primavesi 2008,\nKingsley 1995), although commentators still disagree about whether\nthis new evidence supports the conclusion that there was a single poem\ncombining\n both.[9]\n The correct philosophical understanding of the physical world and the\ncorrect way to live cannot be separated from one another in\nEmpedocles\u2019 thought (a similar attitude appears in Heraclitus);\none cannot fully understand the world without living\n correctly.[10]\n Like the Pythagorean, the Empedoclean way of life included dietary\nrestrictions and a story of transmigrating daim\u014dns who\nseem to have some kind of personal identity. (Marmodoro 2016 is a\ncollection of recent work on Empedocles.)\n8. Presocratic Atomism\n\nThe pluralism of Anaxagoras and Empedocles maintained the Eleatic\nstrictures on metaphysically acceptable basic entities (things that\nare and must be just what they are) by adopting an irreducible\npluralism of stuffs meeting these standards that could pass on their\nqualities to items constructed from them. Ancient atomism responded\nmore radically: what is real is an infinite number of solid,\nuncuttable (atomon) units of matter. All atoms are made of\nthe same stuff (solid matter, in itself otherwise indeterminate),\ndiffering from one another (according to Aristotle in Metaphysics 985b4-20=DK67A6/LM27D31 and R38) only in shape,\nposition, arrangement. Later sources say that atoms differ in weight;\nsome scholars have argued that, while this is certainly true for\npost-Aristotelian atomism, it is less likely for Presocratic atomism.\nRecent scholarship has questioned this view, and find no reason to\ndeny weight to Presocratic atomism (Augustin 2015). In addition to the\nreality of atoms, the Presocratic atomists, Leucippus and Democritus\n(Democritus was born in about 460 BCE in Abdera in Northern Greece,\nshortly after Socrates was born in Athens), enthusiastically endorsed\nthe reality of the empty (or\n void).[11]\n The void is what separates atoms and allows for the differences noted\nabove (except weight, which could not be accounted for by void, since\nvoid in an atom would make it divisible and, hence, not an atom)\n(Sedley 1982; see also Sedley 2008). \n\nLike Anaxagoras, the atomists consider all phenomenal objects and\ncharacteristics as emerging from the background mixture; in the case\nof atomism, the mix of atoms and void (Wardy 1988). Everything is\nconstructed of atoms and void: the shapes of the atoms and their\narrangement with respect to each other (and the intervening void) give\nphysical objects their apparent characteristics. As Democritus says:\n\u201cBy convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention\nhot, by convention cold, by convention color: in reality atoms and\nvoid\u201d (DK68B125/LM27D14, D13a = DK68B9/LM27D4, D14, D15, D23a,\nR108). For example, Theophrastus says that the flavors differ\naccording to the shapes of the atoms that compose various objects;\nthus \u201cDemocritus makes sweet that which is round and quite\nlarge, astringent that which large, rough, polygonal and not\nrounded\u201d ( Caus. Plant. 6.1.6 = 68A129/LM27D60).\nSimplicius reports that things composed of sharp and very fine atoms\nin similar positions are hot and fiery; those composed of atoms with\nthe opposite character come to be cold and watery (in Phys.\n36.3\u20136 = 67A14). Moreover, Theophrastus reports that the\natomists explain why iron is harder than lead but lighter; it is\nharder because of the uneven arrangements of the atoms that make it\nup, lighter because it contains more void than lead. Lead, on the\nother hand, has less void than iron, but the even arrangement of the\natoms makes lead easier to cut or to bend (de Sens. 61\u201363 =\n68A135/LM27D64, D65, D66, D67, D69, D134, D147, D157, D158, D159a).\n\n\nAdopting a strong distinction between appearance and reality, and\ndenying the accuracy of appearances, as we see him do in the above\nquotation, Democritus was seen by some ancient sources (especially\nSextus Empiricus) as a sort of skeptic, yet the evidence is unclear.\nIt is true that Democritus is quoted as saying, \u201cIn truth we\nknow nothing; for truth is in the depths\u201d (DK68B117/LM27D24). So\nfor him, the truth is not given in the appearances. Yet, even Sextus\nseems to agree that Democritus allows for knowledge:\n\nBut in the Rules [Democritus] says that there are two kinds\nof knowing, one through the senses and the other through the\nunderstanding. The one through the understanding he calls genuine,\nwitnessing to its trustworthiness in deciding truth; the one through\nthe senses he names bastard, denying it steadfastness in the\ndiscernment of what is true. He says in these words, \u201cThere are\ntwo forms of knowing, one genuine and the other bastard. To the\nbastard belong all these: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The\nother, the genuine, has been separated from this\u201d\n[DK68B11/LM27D6, D20, D21, R108]. Then preferring the genuine to the\nbastard, he continues, saying, \u201cWhenever the bastard is no\nlonger able to see more finely nor hear nor smell nor taste nor\nperceive by touch, but something finer\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThus Sextus suggests that the evidence of the senses, when properly\ninterpreted by reason, can be taken as a guide to reality (the claim\nthat \u201cappearances are a sight of the unseen\u201d is attributed\nto Democritus as well as to Anaxagoras). We just need to know how to\nfollow this guide, through proper reasoning, so as to reach the\ntruth\u2014i.e., the theory of atoms and void (Lee 2005).\n\nIn addition to fragments advancing these metaphysical and physical\ndoctrines, there are a number of ethical fragments attributed to\nDemocritus (but the question of authenticity looms large here);\nalthough a passage reported in John Stobaeus seems to link moderation\nand cheerfulness with small measured movements in the soul and says\nthat excess and deficiencies give rise to large movements\n(DK68B191/LMD226), it is unclear whether or how these claims are\nrelated to the metaphysical aspects of atomism (Vlastos 1945 and 1946,\nKahn 1985b). Democritus was identified in antiquity with the idea of\n\u201cgood cheer\u201d (euthumi\u0113) as the proper\nguiding objective in living one\u2019s life. In this, as in other\naspects of his philosophy, he may have had some influence on the\nformation of Epicurus\u2019 philosophy a century later.\n9. Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists\n\nIn the last part of the 5th century, Diogenes of Apollonia\n(active after 440 BCE) revived and revised the Milesian system of\ncosmology, claiming that \u201call the things that are are\nalterations from the same thing and are the same thing\u201d\n(64B2/LM28D3); he identified this single basic substance with air,\nlike Anaximenes more than a century before (Graham 2006, Laks 2008,\n2008a). Diogenes takes care to give arguments for the reality and\nproperties of his basic principle. In DK64B2/LM28D3 he says that only\nthings that are alike can affect one another. If there were a\nplurality of basic substances, each differing in what Diogenes calls\ntheir \u201cown proper nature,\u201d there could be no interaction\nbetween them. Yet the evidence of the senses is clear: things mix and\nseparate and interact with one another. Thus, all things must be forms\nof some one single thing. Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes claims that the\ncosmic system is ordered by intelligence, and he argues that that\n\u201cwhich possesses intelligence (no\u0113sis) is what\nhuman beings call air\u201d (DK64B5/LM28D10). Humans and animals live\nby breathing air, and are governed by it \u2014in them air is both\nsoul and intelligence, or mind (DK64B4/LM28D2). Moreover, Diogenes\nargues, air governs and rules all things and is god (DK64B5/LM28D10).\nThus, like Anaxagoras, Diogenes has a theory grounded in intelligence,\nalthough Diogenes is more fully committed to teleological\nexplanations, insofar as he states explicitly that intelligence\n(no\u0113sis) orders things in a good way (DK64B3/LM28D56).\nIn presenting his arguments, Diogenes fulfills his own requirement for\na philosophical claim. In DK64B1/LM28D2 he says, \u201cIn my opinion,\nanyone beginning a logos (account) ought to present a\nstarting principle (arch\u0113) that is indisputable and a\nstyle that is simple and stately.\u201d He notes that his theory that\nair is soul and intelligence \u201cwill have been made clearly\nevident in this book\u201d (DK64B4/LMD9). \n\nTheophrastus says that Diogenes was the last of the physical\nphilosophers, the physiologoi, or \u201cinquirers into\nnature,\u201d as Aristotle called them; Diogenes Laertius\n(Lives II.16\u201317) gives that title to Archelaus, saying that\nhe was the teacher of Socrates (see Betegh 2013a). There was also\nanother group of thinkers active about this time: the Sophists. Many\nof our views about this group have been shaped by Plato\u2019s\naggressively negative assessment of them: in his dialogues Plato\nexpressly contrasts the genuine philosopher, i.e., Socrates, with the\nSophists, especially in their role as teachers of young men growing\ninto their maturity (youths at the age when Socrates, too, engaged\nwith them in his discussions). Modern scholarship (Woodruff and\nGagarin 2008, Kerferd 1981, Guthrie 1969) has shown the diversity of\ntheir views. They were not completely uninterested in the theoretical\nproblems that concerned others of the Presocratics. Gorgias of\nLeontini questioned the possibility of the certainty that Parmenides\nsought. In his On Nature, or On what-is-not, Gorgias\nclaims that nothing satisfies (or can satisfy) Parmenides\u2019\nrequirements for what-is (Mansfeld 1985, Mourelatos 1987b, Palmer\n1999, Caston 2002, Curd 2006). Protagoras, too, doubted the\npossibility of the strong theoretical knowledge that the Presocratics\nchampioned. The Sophists raised ethical and political questions: Does\nlaw or convention ground what is right, or is it a matter of nature?\nThey traveled widely, sometimes serving as diplomats, and they were\nboth entertainers and teachers. They gave public displays of rhetoric\n(this contrasts with Diogenes of Apollonia\u2019s comments about his\nbook, which seems to imply a more private\n enterprise)[12]\n and took on students, teaching both the art of rhetoric and the\nskills necessary for succeeding in Greek political life. With the\nSophists, as with Socrates, interest in ethics and political thought\nbecomes a more prominent aspect of Greek philosophy.\n10. The Presocratic Legacy\n\nThe range of Presocratic thought shows that the first philosophers\nwere not merely physicists (although they were certainly that). Their\ninterests extended to religious and ethical thought, the nature of\nperception and understanding, mathematics, meteorology, the nature of\nexplanation, and the roles of matter, form, causal mechanisms, and\nstructure in the world. Almost all the Presocratics seemed to have\nsomething to say about embryology, and fragments of Diogenes and\nEmpedocles show a keen interest in the structures of the body; the\noverlap between ancient philosophy and ancient medicine is of growing\ninterest to scholars of early Greek thought (Longrigg 1963, van der\nEijk 2008). Recent discoveries, such as the Derveni Papyrus, show that\ninterest in and knowledge of the early philosophers was not\nnecessarily limited to a small audience of rationalistic\nintellectuals. They passed on many of what later became the basic\nconcerns of philosophy to Plato and Aristotle, and ultimately to the\nwhole tradition of Western philosophical thought.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSouTexTra\">Primary Sources: Texts and Translations</a>", "<a name=\"SecLitArtBooColSurEnc\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSouTexTra\">Primary Sources: Texts and Translations</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Bollack, J., 1965 and 1969, <em>Emp\u00e9docle</em>, vol.
