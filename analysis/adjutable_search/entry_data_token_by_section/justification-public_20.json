    "main_text": "Objections || The Asymmetry Objection\n6.6 The Asymmetry Objection\n\nPublic reason liberals argue that reasonable people will disagree\nabout the human good. But they also claim that reasonable people will\nagree on conceptions of justice. Some critics say these claims are\nproblematic because they are asymmetric. The same factors that drive\nreasonable pluralism about the good apply to justice, hence the\nasymmetry. (For discussion and rebuttal, see Quong 2011,\n192\u2013220.) This objection applies to a wide range of\ninterpretations of the PJP. But convergence theorists often accept\njustice pluralism. (Gaus 2011, 276\u20139; Gaus and Van Schoelandt\n2017, Vallier 2019, Gjesdal 2022).\n",
