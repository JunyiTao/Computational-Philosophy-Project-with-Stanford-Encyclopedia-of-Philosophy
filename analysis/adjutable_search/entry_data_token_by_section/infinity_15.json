Suppose that the lamp is initially off. In the first minute, we\nchange the state of the lamp from off to on. In the next half minute,\nwe change the state of the lamp from on to off. \u2026 In the next\n\\(1/2^n\\) minute we change the state of the lamp to the other state\n\u2026 . The question that we are invited to answer is: what is the\nstate of the lamp at the end of the second minute?\n\nThe scenario is under-described. We can imagine that the means of\nturning the lamp off and on requires a spacetime location at which at\nleast one physical quantity is infinite. If so, it is plausible to say\nthat the case is impossible: there could not be such a lamp, and so\nthere is no question to answer. Suppose, for example, that there is a\nswitch that moves the same distance back and forth to turn the lamp on\nand off. Consider the speed at which the tip of the switch is\ntravelling at the end of the second minute.\n\nWe can also imagine that the means of turning the lamp off and on does\nnot involve any spacetime location at which at least one physical\nquantity is infinite; Gr\u00fcnbaum (1968) describes a scenario that\nfits this specification. In that case, the means of turning the lamp\noff and on converges to a specified state at the end of the two\nminutes, and there is an answer to the question that lies in the\ndetails of the specified state. But that answer is underdetermined by\nthe brief description that we were initially given, as Benacerraf\n(1962) argues: we can have the lamp on at the end of the two minutes,\nor off at the end of the two minutes, depending upon the details of\nthe implementation of Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s proposal. Huemer (2016:\n198\u2013201) points out that if we hold fixed enough physics, then,\nbefore the end of the two minutes, the activation of the mechanism\nwill stop changing the state of the lamp. So, depending upon your\nviews about the range of what is possible, you may regard as\nimpossible even cases in which there is no spacetime location at which\nat least one physical quantity is infinite.\n\nThomson\u2019s lamp is an example of a supertask (Thomson\ncoined this term): a process that involves infinitely many steps\ncompleted in a finite amount of time. The trick is that the steps are\ncompleted in shorter and shorter periods of time, corresponding to a\nconvergent series. The lamp is one of many examples of supertasks that\nvarious authors have found paradoxical, while other authors have been\nless troubled by them. See the entry on\n supertasks.\n\nFor further discussion of Thomson\u2019s lamp, see: Thomson (1954,\n1967), Benacerraf (1962), Chihara (1965), Gr\u00fcnbaum (1968, 1973),\nCraig (1979), Berresford (1981), Moore (1990/2019), Earman and Norton\n(1996), McLaughlin (1998), Oppy (2006), Huemer (2016), and Pruss\n(2018a).\n",
