    "main_text": "The Nature of Imagination || Norms of Imagination\n1.3 Norms of Imagination\n\nThere are general norms that govern operations of imagination (Gendler\n2003).\n\nMirroring is manifest to the extent that features of the\nimaginary situation that have not been explicitly stipulated are\nderivable via features of their real-world analogues, or, more\ngenerally, to the extent that imaginative content is taken to be\ngoverned by the same sorts of restrictions that govern believed\ncontent. For example, in a widely-discussed experiment conducted by\nAlan Leslie (1994), children are asked to engage in an imaginary tea\nparty. When an experimenter tips and \u201cspills\u201d one of the\n(empty) teacups, children consider the non-tipped cup to be\n\u201cfull\u201d (in the context of the pretense) and the tipped cup\nto be \u201cempty\u201d (both within and outside of the context of\nthe pretense). In fact, both make-believe games and more complicated\nengagements with the arts are governed by principles of\ngeneration, according to which prompts or props prescribe\nparticular imaginings (Walton 1990).\n\nQuarantining is manifest to the extent that events within the\nimagined or pretended episode are taken to have effects only within a\nrelevantly circumscribed domain. So, for example, the child engaging\nin the make-believe tea party does not expect that\n\u201cspilling\u201d (imaginary) \u201ctea\u201d will result in\nthe table really being wet, nor does a person who imagines\nwinning the lottery expect that when she visits the ATM, her bank\naccount will contain a million dollars. More generally, quarantining\nis manifest to the extent that proto-beliefs and proto-attitudes\nconcerning the imagined state of affairs are not treated as beliefs\nand attitudes relevant to guiding action in the actual world.\n\nAlthough imaginative episodes are generally governed by mirroring and\nquarantining, both may be violated in systematic ways.\n\nMirroring gives way to disparity as a result of the ways in\nwhich (the treatment of) imaginary content may differ from (that of)\nbelieved content. Imagined content may be incomplete (for\nexample, there may be no fact of the matter (in the pretense) just how\nmuch tea has spilled on the table) or incoherent (for\nexample, it might be that the toaster serves (in the pretense) as a\nlogical-truth inverter). And content that is imagined may give rise to\ndiscrepant responses, most strikingly in cases of discrepant\naffect\u2014where, for example, the imminent destruction of all human\nlife is treated as amusing rather than terrifying.\n\nQuarantining gives way to contagion when imagined content\nends up playing a direct role in actual attitudes and behavior (see\nalso Gendler 2008a, 2008b). This is common in cases of affective\ntransmission, where an emotional response generated by an\nimagined situation may constrain subsequent behavior. For example,\nimagining something fearful (such as a tiger in the kitchen) may give\nrise to actual hesitation (such as reluctance to enter the room). And\nit also occurs in cases of cognitive transmission, where\nimagined content is thereby \u201cprimed\u201d and rendered more\naccessible in ways that go on to shape subsequent perception and\nexperience. For example, imagining some object (such as a sheep) may\nmake one more likely to \u201cperceive\u201d such objects in\none\u2019s environment (such as mistaking a rock for a ram).\n",
