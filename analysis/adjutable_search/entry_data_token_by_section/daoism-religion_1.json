    "main_text": "Early Daoist Texts || Laozi and the Daode jing\n1.1 Laozi and the Daode jing\n\nCurrent Western scholarship is virtually unanimous in asserting that\nthere was no historical Laozi. The reputed author of the Daode\njing, whose name means Old Master, might be best seen as a\n\u201ccollective entity\u201d who embodies the nameless\ntradition\u2014mainly oral, as far as we know\u2014that is behind\nthe text and the ideal of sainthood that the text describes.\n\nWhile the author and his work are traditionally dated to the\n6th century BCE, the Mawangdui and especially the Guodian manuscripts\n(discovered in 1972 and 1993, respectively; Henricks 1989 and 2000)\nhave helped to establish that early exemplars of the Daode\njing\u2014shorter than the current versions and different from\none another\u2014circulated by the latter half of the 4th\ncentury BCE. It is also usually acknowledged, though, that the text\nincorporates earlier oral traditions. While this makes the issue of\ndating virtually impossible to solve, it also suggests that at first\nthere was no \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d\nexemplar of the text, which probably existed in several versions of\nvarying content and length until, probably in the late 3rd\ncentury BCE, it was compiled in a form close to the one we know today.\n(For overviews of the Daode jing and its exegetical\ntradition, see Chan 2000 and Robinet 1999, respectively.)\n\nThe Daode jing discusses three main subjects: the Dao, the\nsaint (or the realized person), and the ruler and his government.\nSeveral early Chinese traditions speak of a Dao, or \u201cWay\u201d,\nbut the Daode jing is the earliest source that uses this word\nto designate the origin and source of existence. As the absolute\nprinciple, the Dao is beyond description or definition. It does not\neven have a name: the word dao is used only because one\n\u201cis forced\u201d to refer to it (sec. 25). [Here and below,\nreferences are to the number of section in the 81-section editions of\nthe text, a subdivision also adopted in most translations into\nWestern languages.] Being formless, the Dao is \u201cconstant\u201d\n(chang, 1), does not undergo change (41), and is\n\u201cinvisible\u201d, \u201cinaudible\u201d, and\n\u201cimperceptible\u201d (14). Yet the Dao contains an\n\u201cessence\u201d (jing) that is the seed of its\nself-manifestation (21), which occurs without intention and through\n\u201cnon-doing\u201d (wuwei; 37). The faculty through\nwhich the Dao manifests itself, and generates and nourishes all\nindividual entities, is its de, or \u201cvirtue,\npower\u201d, the second term in the title of the Daode jing.\nUnder this aspect, the Dao is called the \u201cbeginning\u201d of\nthe world and its \u201cmother\u201d (1). The two aspects of the\nDao\u2014the absolute and its manifestation as the\nrelative\u2014\u201ccome forth together\u201d, and their\ncoexistence is \u201cmystery and then again mystery\u201d (1).\n\nThe highest realized person in the Daode jing is the\nshengren, a term that, in a Daoist context, is sometimes\ntranslated as \u201csaint\u201d to distinguish it from the Confucian\n\u201csage\u201d. While the Confucian sage embodies the highest\nethical standards of benevolence (ren) and righteousness\n(yi), the Daoist saint operates in the world by taking the\noperation of the Dao as his model: according to the Daode\njing, benevolence, righteousness, and the other qualities of the\nConfucian sage emerge only \u201cwhen the Dao is abandoned\u201d\n(18). The Daoist saint does not act on the basis of personal interest,\nadvantage, or desire; he does not take initiative; and he does not\nintend to lead others (3, 7, 22, 37, 57, 67). Instead, he is in the\nfront by placing himself \u201cbehind\u201d, and acts only by\nresponding to what external circumstances require. This is his\n\u201cnon-doing\u201d (wuwei), the perfect action in which \u201cthere is\nno doing, yet nothing is not done\u201d (48; the same is also said of\nthe operation of the Dao, 37).\n\nAlthough the reciprocal tasks are different, the ruler is supposed to\noperate in the kingdom in the same way as the saint operates in the world. The\nDaode jing expresses this view in words analogous to those\nquoted above for the saint: \u201cDo non-doing, and there is nothing\nthat is not governed\u201d (3). This involves that the ruler should\nissue few laws and prohibitions (57) and instead allow the people to\noperate by themselves (37). Since the Confucian virtues arise\n\u201cwhen the Dao is abandoned\u201d and \u201cwhen the country is\nin confusion\u201d (5, 18), the saintly ruler should not use them as\nprinciples of government.\n",
