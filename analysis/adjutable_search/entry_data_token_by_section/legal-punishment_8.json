Collateral Consequences\n\nPunishment theorists should also attend to various other kinds of\nburdensome consequences of criminal convictions, often called\n\u2018collateral consequences\u2019. Most centrally, those convicted\nof crimes are subject to a range of coercive state policies: measures\nrestricting offenders\u2019 access to jobs, housing, public\nassistance, the vote, and a host of others goods; subjecting them to\ncontinued detention; making their criminal records publicly available,\nand so on \u2014 often long after they have completed their formal\ncriminal sentences (see, e.g., von Hirsch and Wasik 1997; LaFollette\n2005; de Keijser 2012; Hoskins 2014a, 2016, 2019; Sigler 2014; Bennett\n2016; Brown 2021). Legal practice has tended to treat these sorts of\nmeasures not as part of an offender\u2019s punishment, but as civil\nor administrative measures (one effect of which is that they often\nescape the constraints of justice and proportionality to which\npunishment is subject). Many coercive measures are imposed even on\nthose who have not been convicted, such as the many kinds of\nrestriction that may be imposed on people suspected of involvement in\nterrorism, or housing or job restrictions tied merely to arrests\nrather than convictions.\n\nThe legal measures are relevant for punishment theorists for a number\nof reasons, but here we note just two: First, at least some of these\nrestrictive measures may be best regarded as as additional forms of\npunishment (see Lippke 2016: ch. 9; Hoskins 2019: chs. 3 and 4). For\nsuch measures, we must ask whether they are (or can be made to be)\nconsistent with the principles and considerations we believe should\ngovern impositions of punishment. Second, even if at least some\nmeasures are not best regarded as additional forms of punishment, we\nshould ask what justifies the state in imposing additional coercive\nmeasures on those convicted of crimes outside the context of the\npunishment itself (see Ashworth and Zedner 2011, 2012; Ramsay 2011;\nAshworth, Zedner, and Tomlin 2013; Hoskins 2019: chs. 5\u20137). For\ninstance, if we regard punishment as the way in which offenders pay\ntheir debts to society, we can argue that it is at least presumptively\nunjustified for the state to impose additional burdensome measures on\noffenders once this debt has been paid. To say that certain measures\nare presumptively unjustified is not, of course, to establish that\nthey are all-things-considered prohibited. Various collateral\nconsequences \u2014 restrictions on employment or housing, for\nexample \u2014 are often defended as public safety measures. We might\nargue (see Hoskins 2019: ch. 7) that in some cases considerations of\npublic safety can be sufficiently compelling to justify certain\nmeasures (for example, measures that bar people with convictions for\nchild sex offences from working as teachers, or that bar fraudsters\nfrom working in jobs where they are responsible for other people's\nmoney). Public safety restrictions could only be justifiable, however,\nwhen there is a sufficiently compelling public safety interest, when\nthe measures will be effective in serving that interest, when the\nmeasures will not do more harm than good, and when there are no less\nburdensome means of achieving the public safety aim. Even for public\nsafety measures that meet these conditions, we should not lose sight\nof the worry that imposing such restrictions on people with criminal\nconvictions but who have served their terms of punishment denies them\nthe equal treatment to which they, having paid their debt, are\nentitled (on this last worry, see, e.g., Walen 2011:1264\u201366;\nLippke 2016: ch. 9; Hoskins 2019: ch. 7).\n\nIn addition to these formal legal consequences of a conviction, people\nwith criminal records also face a range of informal collateral\nconsequences, such as social stigma, family tensions, discrimination\nby employers and housing authorities, and financial challenges. These\nconsequences are not imposed by positive law, but they may be\npermitted by formal legal provisions (such as those that grant broad\ndiscretion to public housing authorities in the United States making\nadmission decisions) or facilitated by them (such as when laws making\ncriminal records widely accessible enable employers or landlords to\ndiscriminate against those with criminal histories). There are also\nwidely documented burdensome consequences of a conviction to the\nfamily members or loved ones of those who are convicted, and to their\ncommunities. These sorts of informal consequences of criminal\nconvictions appear less likely than the formal legal consequences to\nconstitute legal punishment, insofar as they are not intentionally\nimposed by the state (but see Kolber 2012). Still, the informal\ncollateral consequences of a conviction are arguably relevant to\ntheorising about punishment, and we should examine when, if ever, such\nburdens are relevant to sentencing determinations (on sentencing, see\ns. 10), or whether the state has obligations to ensure that the\nburdens of punishment do not spill over beyond the intended burdens of\nthe criminal sentence (see Manning 2011; B\u00fclow 2014; Lippke\n2017).\n",
