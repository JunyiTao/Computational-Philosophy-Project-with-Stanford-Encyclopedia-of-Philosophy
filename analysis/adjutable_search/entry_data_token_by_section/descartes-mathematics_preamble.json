    "main_text": "\n\nTo speak of Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 contributions to the history\nof mathematics is to speak of his La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\n(1637), a short tract included with the anonymously published\nDiscourse on Method. In La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie,\nDescartes details a groundbreaking program for geometrical\nproblem-solving\u2014what he refers to as a \u201cgeometrical\ncalculus\u201d (calcul g\u00e9om\u00e9trique)\u2014that\nrests on a distinctive approach to the relationship between algebra\nand geometry. Specifically, Descartes offers innovative algebraic\ntechniques for analyzing geometrical problems, a novel way of\nunderstanding the connection between a curve\u2019s construction and\nits algebraic equation, and an algebraic classification of curves that\nis based on the degree of the equations used to represent these\ncurves.\n\nThe problem-solving techniques and mathematical results that Descartes\npresents in La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie were both novel and\nincredibly influential on the practice of early modern mathematics.\nHowever, we can also locate in La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie a\nphilosophical significance: The blending of algebra and geometry and\nthe peculiar approach to the \u201cgeometrical\u201d status of\ncurves which characterize Descartes\u2019 mathematical program stand\nas notable contributions to the on-going philosophical debates that\nsurrounded early modern mathematical practice. By drawing on the\ncontext in which Descartes\u2019 mathematical researches took place,\nand examining the main questions and issues that shaped\nDescartes\u2019 early mathematical researches, both the historical\nand philosophical significance of Books One and Two of La\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie will be highlighted in what\n follows.[1]\n",
