    "main_text": "Types of Arguments || Induction\n2.2 Induction\n\nInductive arguments are arguments where observations about past\ninstances and regularities lead to conclusions about future instances\nand general principles. For example, the observation that the sun has\nrisen in the east every single day until now leads to the conclusion\nthat it will rise in the east tomorrow, and to the general principle\n\u201cthe sun always rises in the east\u201d. Generally speaking,\ninductive arguments are based on statistical frequencies, which then\nlead to generalizations beyond the sample of cases initially under\nconsideration: from the observed to the unobserved. In a good, i.e.,\ncogent, inductive argument, the truth of the premises\nprovides some degree of support for the truth of the conclusion. In\ncontrast with a deductively valid argument, in an inductive argument\nthe degree of support will never be maximal, as there is always the\npossibility of the conclusion being false given the truth of the\npremises. A gloss in terms of possible worlds might be that, while in\na deductively valid argument the conclusion will hold in all possible\nworlds where the premises hold, in a good inductive argument the\nconclusion will hold in a significant proportion of the possible\nworlds where the premises hold. The proportion of such worlds may give\na measure of the strength of support of the premises for the\nconclusion (see entry on\n inductive logic).\n\nInductive arguments have been recognized and used in science and\nelsewhere for millennia. The concept of induction (epagoge in\nGreek) was understood by Aristotle as a progression from particulars\nto a universal, and figured prominently both in his conception of the\nscientific method and in dialectical practices (see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic, section 3.1).\n However, a deductivist conception of the scientific method remained\noverall more influential in Aristotelian traditions, inspired by the\ntheory of scientific demonstration of the Posterior\nAnalytics. It is only with the so-called \u201cscientific\nrevolution\u201d of the early modern period that experiments and\nobservation of individual cases became one of the pillars of\nscientific methodology, a transition that is strongly associated with\nthe figure of Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626; see entry on\n Francis Bacon).\n\nInductive inferences/arguments are ubiquitous both in science and in\neveryday life, and for the most part quite reliable. The functioning\nof the world around us seems to display a fair amount of statistical\nregularity, and this is referred to as the \u201cUniformity\nPrinciple\u201d in the literature on the problem of induction (to be\ndiscussed shortly). Moreover, it has been argued that generalizing\nfrom previously observed frequencies is the most basic principle of\nhuman cognition (Clark 2016).\n\nHowever, it has long been recognized that inductive\ninferences/arguments are not unproblematic. Hume famously offered the\nfirst influential formulation of what became known as \u201cthe\nproblem of induction\u201d in his Treatise of Human Nature\n(see entries on\n David Hume\n and on\n the problem of induction;\n Howson 2000). Hume raises the question of what grounds the\ncorrectness of inductive inferences/arguments, and posits that there\nmust be an argument establishing the validity of the Uniformity\nPrinciple for inductive inferences to be truly justified. He goes on\nto argue that this argument cannot be deductive, as it is not\ninconceivable that the course of nature may change. But it cannot be\nprobable either, as probable arguments already presuppose the validity\nof the Uniformity Principle; circularity would ensue. Since these are\nthe only two options, he concludes that the Uniformity Principle\ncannot be established by rational argument, and hence that induction\ncannot be justified.\n\nA more recent influential critique of inductive arguments is the one\noffered in (Harman 1965). Harman argues that either enumerative\ninduction is not always warranted, or it is always warranted but\nconstitutes an uninteresting special case of the more general category\nof inference to the best explanation (see next section). The upshot is\nthat, for Harman, induction should not be considered a warranted form\nof inference in its own right.\n\nGiven the centrality of induction for scientific practice, there have\nbeen numerous attempts to respond to the critics of induction, with\nvarious degrees of success. Among those, an influential recent\nresponse to the problem of induction is Norton\u2019s material theory\nof induction (Norton 2003). But the problem has not prevented\nscientists and laypeople alike from continuing to use induction\nwidely. More recently, the use of statistical frequencies for social\ncategories to draw conclusions about specific individuals has become a\nmatter of contention, both at the individual level (see entry on\n implicit bias)\n and at the institutional level (e.g., the use of predictive\nalgorithms for law enforcement [Jorgensen Bolinger 2021]). These\ndebates can be seen as reoccurrences of Hume\u2019s problem of\ninduction, now in the domain of social rather than of natural\nphenomena.\n",
