    "main_text": "Biomedicine as a Framework for Medicine + Biology || What is biomedicine?\n1.1 What is biomedicine?\n\nAs explored in this entry, and outlined in how the sections are\ndivided in the entry, biomedicine has many facets. It is a very large\nand complex thing. It is a morphing historical product of the\npost-World War Two West. It is a contemporary global social\ninstitution. It is an epistemology of medical research and practice\n(albeit with factions). It is a set of ontological and metaphysical\ncommitments. And more. \n\nThe US National Cancer Institute defines biomedicine as synonymous\nwith \u201callopathic medicine, conventional medicine, mainstream\nmedicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine\u201d (NCI\n Other Internet Resources,\n accessed 12 March 2020). By contrast, A. E. Clarke, Mamo, Fishman,\nShim, and Fosket (2003) takes an expansive view of the nature of\nbiomedicine, contending that it is an evolving entity, a cohesive and\ndeveloping whole that consists of elements ranging from the assertion\nthat good health is a personal moral obligation to the increasing\nreliance on \u201ccomputerization and data banking\u201d (A. E.\nClarke et al. 2003: 173).\n\nKrieger offers a detailed examination of the history and philosophy of\nthe \u201cbiomedicine approach,\u201d and extracts three key tenets\nof the view.\n\n\nAmong the many features of a biomedical perspective, three stand out\nas fundamental regarding its approach to investigating disease (Lock\n& Gordon 1988; Fee & Krieger 1994; Krieger 1994; Lawrence\n& Weisz 1998; Cambrosio & Keating 2001; Bynum 2008). They\nare:\n\nFirst, specific to biomedicine: the domain of disease and its\ncauses is restricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical\nphenomena;\nSecond, shared with many natural sciences: an emphasis on\nlaboratory research and technology and, as translated to health\nresearch, a discounting of research questions that cannot be studied\nby randomized clinical trials (or their analogs, e.g., \u201cnatural\nexperiments\u201d); and\nThird: an embrace of \u201creductionism,\u201d a philosophical\nand methodological stance (discussed more fully below) that holds that\nphenomena are best explained by the properties of their parts.\n(Krieger 2011: 130)\n\n\n\nKrieger\u2019s account of biomedicine offers a compelling\ndistillation of the philosophical commitments of biomedical science.\nThough since this is an entry on philosophy of biomedicine,\nthe entry will be organized around philosophical dimensions and\ndebates, rather than being organized directly around these core\ntheoretical tenets (e.g., the upcoming section is on ontological and\nmetaphysical commitments). Additionally, this entry will supplement\nthe tenets identified by Krieger with discussion of connected issues,\nsuch as philosophical critiques of biomedicine as a social institution\n (Section 4).\n\nThe terms \u201cframework\u201d and \u201capproach\u201d are used\nhere to describe biomedicine, in an attempt to avoid narrowly\novercommitting to any particular philosophical system. Biomedicine may\nor may not qualify as one of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s\n\u201cparadigms\u201d, in the way that the heliocentric model of the\nsolar system is a paradigm\u2014a complex worldview in which the\nviewpoints cannot be straightforwardly translated back-and-forth with\nan alternative paradigm (i.e., if we try to translate the concepts of\nbiomedicine to the pre-biomedical concepts of humoral theory,\ndiscussed in\n Section 1.2\n (Kuhn 1962). Alternatively, biomedicine seems to qualify as one of\nImre Lakatos\u2019 Research Programmes, a different way of conceiving\nof the way that research communities intellectually cohere (Lakatos\n1968). It\u2019s a question of how biomedicine serves as a\nmeans of organizing and guiding research.\n\nWithout getting too lost in the technical criteria, biomedicine shares\nthe Kuhnian paradigm quality of being incommensurable (or at least\nmore or less so) with other conceptions of biology and health.\nScholars of complementary medicine have spent enormous effort\nsearching for ways that traditional medical practices\u2014e.g.,\nherbal treatments handed down over generations\u2014can get a\nfoothold in a medical world dominated by biomedicine. It is telling\nthat there is no question that \u2018proof\u2019 of a\ntreatment\u2019s efficacy requires starting from scratch, by\nexamining the herb\u2019s chemical makeup, isolating and analyzing\nwhich chemical components are the active ingredients, and then testing\nsafety and efficacy, all entirely within biomedicine\u2019s rules.\nWhatever explanations might have been offered by herbalists (e.g.,\n\u2018it calms turmoil in the stomach\u2019) are irrelevant\nuntranslatable knowledge. Biomedicine also shares the Lakatosian\nResearch Programme quality of (largely implicitly) dictating what\nsorts of internal dispute about biomedicine is permissible. Within the\nbiomedical Research Programme, one is invited to question whether a\nparticular experimental design is suitable; one is not permitted to\nreject experimentation entirely.\n",
