    "main_text": "Sources\n4. Sources\n\nWilliam was one of the first thinkers in the Latin West to begin to\nengage seriously with Aristotle\u2019s writings on metaphysics and\nnatural philosophy and with the thought of Islamic and Jewish\nthinkers, especially Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, 980\u20131037) and\nAvicebron (Solomon Ibn Gabirol, 1021/2\u20131057/8) (see e.g.\nBertolacci 2012, Caster 1996c, de Vaux 1934 and Teske 1999). The works\nof these thinkers, which had been coming into circulation in Latin\ntranslations from around the middle of the twelfth century, presented\nboth philosophical sophistication and theological danger. Indeed, in\n1210, public and private lecturing on Aristotle\u2019s works on\nnatural philosophy and commentaries on them was forbidden at Paris,\nand in 1215 the papal legate, Cardinal Robert of Cour\u00e7on\nforbade \u201cmasters in arts from \u2018reading,\u2019 i.e.,\nlecturing, on Aristotle\u2019s books on natural philosophy along with\nthe Metaphysics and Summae of the same (probably\ncertain works of Avicenna and perhaps of Alfarabi)\u201d (Wippel\n2003, 66). This prohibition remained in effect until it unofficially\nlapsed around 1231. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that personal\nstudy of these texts had not been forbidden, and William clearly\nworked hard to master them. He came to be keenly aware of the\nincompatibility of much of the teaching of these works with Christian\ndoctrine, yet at the same time he found them to be a source of\nphilosophical inspiration, and his thought brims with ideas drawn from\nAvicenna and Avicebron. His attitude to these thinkers is expressed\nwell in a passage in On the Soul, where, regarding Aristotle,\nhe writes that:\n\nthough on many points one must contradict Aristotle, as is really\nright and proper\u2014and this holds for all the statements by which\nhe contradicts the truth\u2014he should be accepted in all those\nstatements in which he is found to have held the right view. (OO II\nsuppl., 82a; Teske 2000, 89)\n\n\nOf course, William was also strongly influenced by Christian thinkers.\nIn particular, his writings are permeated by the thought of Saint\nAugustine, whom William refers to as \u201cone of the more noble of\nChristian thinkers,\u201d if perhaps in a less obvious way than by\nthe thought of Avicenna. Indeed, as the list in Valois 1880,\n198\u2013206, attests, William employs a remarkable range of sources\nand must be reckoned one of the most well-read thinkers of his\nday.\n\nThe focus of the following outline is William\u2019s views on\nmetaphysics and the soul, but even within these limits the vast range\nof his thought has required that many issues in these areas not be\ntreated. In a future supplement, William\u2019s views on value theory\nand morality will be addressed. Teske\u2019s English translations are\nquoted whenever possible; otherwise, translations are my own (i.e. N.\nLewis\u2019s).\n",
