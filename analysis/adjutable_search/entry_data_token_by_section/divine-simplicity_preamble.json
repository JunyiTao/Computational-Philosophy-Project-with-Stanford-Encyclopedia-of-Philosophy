    "main_text": "\n\nAccording to the classical theism of Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and\ntheir adherents, God is radically unlike creatures and cannot be\nadequately understood in ways appropriate to them. God is simple in\nthat God transcends every form of complexity and composition familiar\nto the discursive intellect. One consequence is that the simple God\nlacks parts. This lack is not a deficiency but a positive feature. God\nis ontologically superior to every partite entity, and his\npartlessness is an index thereof. Broadly construed,\n\u2018part\u2019 covers not only spatial and temporal parts (if any)\nbut also metaphysical \u2018parts\u2019 or ontological constituents.\nTo say that God lacks metaphysical parts is to say inter alia\nthat God is free of matter-form composition, potency-act composition,\nand existence-essence composition. There is also no real distinction\nbetween God as subject of his attributes and his attributes. God is\nthus in some sense identical to each of his attributes, which\nimplies that each attribute is identical to every other one. God is\nomniscient, then, not in virtue of instantiating or exemplifying\nomniscience \u2014 which would imply a real distinction between God\nand the property of omniscience \u2014 but by being\nomniscience. And the same holds for each of the divine\nomni-attributes: God is what he has as Augustine\nputs it in The City of God, XI, 10. As identical to each of\nhis attributes, God is identical to his nature. And since his nature\nor essence is identical to his existence, God is identical to his\nexistence. This is the doctrine of divine simplicity (DDS). But how\nare we to understand \u2018identity\u2019 in this context? Is it an\nequivalence relation governed by the Indiscernibility of Identicals?\nOr is it some \u2018looser\u2019 form of sameness? These are\nimportant questions but ones that cannot be addressed in this entry\nexcept in passing.\n\nDDS is represented not only in classical Christian theology, but also\nin Jewish, Greek, and Islamic thought. Moses Maimonides, for example,\nheld that in God, \u201cwhose existence is not due to any cause\n\u2026 existence and essence are perfectly identical.\u201d\n(The Guide for the Perplexed, Part One, LVII). DDS is to be\nunderstood as an affirmation of God\u2019s absolute transcendence of\ncreatures. God is not only radically non-anthropomorphic, but\nradically unlike creatures in general, not only in respect of the\nproperties he possesses, but also in his manner of possessing them. It\nis not just that God has properties no creature has; the properties he\nhas he has in a way different from the way any creature has any of its\nproperties. God has his properties by being them. Some explain DDS by\nsaying that God has no properties; this gloss, however, carries the\nunfortunate suggestion that God is a bare particular. It is better to\nput the point in a positive way by saying that God has properties, not\nby instantiating or exemplifying them, but by being them. Unique in\nhis mode of property-possession, God is also unique in his mode of\nexistence and in his modal status. He is not just one necessary being\namong others. His metaphysical necessity, unlike that of other\nnecessary beings, is grounded in his simplicity. The actually infinite\nset of natural numbers is presumably a necessary being, along with\neach of its members, but neither set nor members are necessary in\nvirtue of being ontologically simple. So while one may say that the\nsimple God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds, that is no\naccount of his unique mode of necessity, which is grounded in his\nsimplicity. God is necessary because he is simple and not because he\nexists in all metaphysically possible worlds. And while one may say\nthat the simple God is or exists, God is not an existent among\nexistents or a being among beings, but Being (esse) itself in\nits prime instance and in this respect is different from every other\nbeing (ens). Unique in all these ways, God is\nuniquely unique. He is not unique as one of a kind, but\nunique in transcending the distinction between kind and member of a\nkind. God is unique in his very mode of uniqueness. The simple God, we\ncould say, differs not only in his attributes, but also in his very\nontological structure, from any and all created beings.\n",
