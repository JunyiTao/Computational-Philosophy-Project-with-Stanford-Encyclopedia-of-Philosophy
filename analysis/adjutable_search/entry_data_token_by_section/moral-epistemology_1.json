    "main_text": "Psychological: Moral Motivation\n2. Psychological: Moral Motivation\n\n\nAn argument of David Hume provides a more direct threat to the\npossibility of moral knowledge based on the fact that morals excite\nour passions and motivate us to act. If morals are based on reason so\nthat they consist in true or false ideas, they would have to be in\nthemselves incapable of having this direct influence on our actions\n(Hume, Treatise, Book III, Part I, Section I, Paragraph 6.)\nAs he famously said, it is not contrary to reason to prefer the\ndestruction of the whole world to the scratching of a finger (Book II,\nPart III, Section III, Paragraph 6). The argument can be rendered for\nour purposes as a valid deductive argument from three premises: (1) If\nmoral knowledge is possible, then some moral judgments are\nbeliefs. (2) Our moral judgments by themselves necessarily give us\nsome motivation to act, even without the accompaniment of already\nexisting desires. (3) A belief by itself, unaided by already existing\ndesires, can never give us any motivation to act. Therefore, moral\njudgments are not beliefs. Therefore, moral knowledge is\nimpossible. Since the argument is manifestly valid in form, we need to\nexamine the premises to see if we should be persuaded.\n\n\nPremise (1) appears to follow directly from the nature of knowledge.\nIf one knows that something is the case, then one must have some belief\nor judgment about it and what one believes must truly be the case. If\none doesn\u2019t have any opinion about it or if one\u2019s opinion about it is\nnot true, then one doesn\u2019t know it. To say this much, of course, is not\nto say that true opinion is sufficient for knowledge, but that one\u2019s\njudgment is true has seemed to many philosophers to be a minimally\nnecessary condition for knowledge. Premise (2) states what many take to\nbe a minimally necessary condition for something to be a moral\njudgment. If one claims that something is morally wrong, for example,\nbut one feels no disinclination to do it or to persuade others not to\ndo it, then either one is being insincere or else one is not really\nmaking a moral claim. Notice that the premise does not imply that one\nmust act in accordance with the motivation felt. One can be overcome by\ntemptation or fear or have some other counterbalancing motivation that\nleads one not to act in accordance with one\u2019s moral claim. The premise\nsays only that some motivation to act must exist. This view, called\n\u201cinternalism\u201d, entails that it is a logical or conceptual truth that\nsome degree of motivation is internal to the moral judgment itself.\nFinally, premise (3), sometimes called \u201cHume\u2019s dictum\u201d, is the view\nthat judgments of fact, apart from desires that might accompany them,\ndo not move us in any way. This view follows from the widely held\nunderstanding of motivation as consisting of two kinds of mental state:\nbelief and desire (Davidson 1963 and 2001). Without a belief to guide\nit, desire is blind. A desire for food will, for example, not move one\nto eat unless one has identified something that one believes is food.\nOn the other hand, believing that food is before one won\u2019t move one to\neat, even in the slightest, if one has no desire at all to eat. In sum,\neach premise has at least an initial plausibility. In fact, however,\nthe literature contains objections to each one. Let us turn to the\nobjections, taking the premises in reverse order.\n\n\nThose who attack the third premise (but accept the other two premises)\nsee moral judgments as having the cognitive content of a true or false\njudgment of fact and still being able to motivate the persons making\nthe judgment, independently of their antecedent desires. To judge an\naction to be morally wrong, on their view, is to form a true (or\nfalse) belief about a (supposed) moral fact. It is also to be\nmotivated to some degree to act on the basis of this judgment, not\nbecause of some antecedent desire, but just because of the belief that\nthe action is wrong. Those who take this position sometimes allow that\nmotivation involves desire (for example, not to do the act). Thus they\ncan accept the general view of motivation as involving both belief and\ndesire, but they hold that the desire in this case arises purely from\nthe belief that the act is wrong. It is the moral belief itself that\naccounts for the desire\u2014and hence the motivation\u2014without\nthe support of any desire that is already existing. They would claim,\nmoreover, that this picture comports well with the way moral demands\nare perceived. We see something is wrong, even though we may have\nwanted to do it before this point, and then we find ourselves wanting\nnot to do it because we see it as wrong. (See, for example, McNaughton\n1988, Dancy 1993, Smith 1994, Little 1997.)\n\n\nPremise (3) may not be so easily refuted. It derives support not just\nfrom the view that motivation requires both belief and desire, but\nalso from a basic distinction made by Elizabeth Anscombe about the\ndifferent tasks performed by the states of belief and desire. Anscombe\nasks us to think of a list of groceries that might serve either as an\ninventory of the food in a grocery store or as a shopping list\n(Anscombe 1963). In the first case it merely describes, truly or\nfalsely, what is in the store. If it is a good inventory, the list\nconforms to the items of food in the store. In the second case the\nlist remains a good shopping list even if the items are not in the\nshop; in this case it is the store, not the list, that needs to\nchange. Beliefs are like inventories; desires are like shopping\nlists. They have different and opposite \u201cdirection of fit.\u201d We want\nour beliefs to fit the world and to change when they don\u2019t. But we\nwant the world to fit our desires and to change when it doesn\u2019t. In\nlight of this distinction, it may seem that to reject premise (3) for\nthe reasons given is to suppose that moral judgments necessarily have\nboth directions of fit simultaneously. Is this view of moral judgment\ncoherent? In the case of lack of fit between the moral judgment and\nthe moral facts, the view seems to imply that the moral judgment\nshould change and not change. (For more on direction of fit, see Smith\n1987 and Copp and Sobel 2001.)\n\n\nThe matter does not rest here, however. The critic of premise (3) can\npoint out that moral beliefs are unlike grocery inventories, since the\npart of the world that they are designed to fit is the part that tells\nus how we ought to be morally, rather than the part that tells how we\nare non-morally. Therefore, the moral reality that a moral judgment is\ndesigned to fit is distinct from the non-moral part of the world (our\nbehavior) that may need to change in order to fit the moral\njudgment. Both directions of fit apply, in other words, but they\nrelate moral beliefs to different parts or aspects of reality, moral\nin one case and non-moral in the other. Contradiction is thus avoided.\nNevertheless, if moral judgments have both directions of fit in the\nmanner suggested, then there must be moral facts that are inherently\nprescriptive, demanding that we change ourselves to conform to them.\nSuch facts would be ontologically strange, as John Mackie has noted,\nvery unlike anything studied in science (Mackie 1977). The critic of\npremise (3) may, however, be prepared to live with this result. (We\nwill take up this ontological issue in the next section.) What may be\nmore difficult to live with is rejection of recent results in\nneuroscience. Timothy Schroeder (2004) argues that, except for its\ncontent, moral motivation is not different in its neurobiological\nbasis from other kinds of deliberative motivation. In particular,\nmoral representations of right and wrong move us through projections\non the orbitofrontal cortex in the same way that representations of\nfavorite foods move us. That is, they do not move us directly through\nprojections on our motor centers independently of our desire for the\nthings represented (as is the case with behavioral tics).\n\n\nLet us turn now to premise (2). A critic of internalism can allow\nthat moral beliefs are normally associated with some desire to conform\nto them but would deny that the link between belief and desire in such\ncases is anything more than contingent. To take a simple example to\nconvey the general idea, imagine a utilitarian interpretation of the\ncontent of moral judgments. Suppose, that is, that to judge that an act\nis wrong is to imply that the act leads to a lower net balance of\nhappiness over unhappiness (summed over everyone affected) than some\nalternative act would. It is possible from an externalist perspective\nto judge an act wrong but feel no disinclination to perform it. This\nresult might obtain even if the act leads to horrible suffering on the\npart of everyone else and the person who makes the judgment is fully\naware of this fact and of the content of the judgment. Such cases are\nadmittedly pathological, but the point is that they are at least\nlogically possible contrary to premise (2). Normally, people aren\u2019t\nlike that. In fact, an externalist can argue that most people are\nsocialized so that they have some feeling for the feelings of others.\nFor this reason they will feel some motivation to act in accord with\ntheir moral judgments on a utilitarian interpretation of their content.\nThe connection between the content of the judgment and the motivation,\nhowever, is external, in the sense that the connection is mediated by\nthe contingent fact that people are normally socialized to care to some\ndegree about others (Brink 1989).\n\n\nThe internalists can make at least two kinds of reply. First of all,\nwhile they will concede the existence of people who feel no motivation\nto do what they say they \u201cought\u201d to do, they can deny that these people\nhave made genuine moral judgments. There is a manner of speaking in\nwhich we can say that something is wrong but mean only that this is\nwhat is considered wrong around here or in the culture under\ndiscussion. The trouble is that disputes over whether the examples in\nquestion are cases of genuine moral judgment can easily degenerate into\nexercises in stipulative definition and the trading of intuitions\ntutored by divergent theories. It is moot whether anything can settle\nthis matter (Fenske 1997). A more promising line of reply is to point\nout that the externalist\u2019s theory of moral motivation does not sit\ncomfortably with the way we learn to receive moral criticism and make\nmoral judgments. From an early age we learn to respond to moral\njudgments made by our elders and to form them ourselves through\nlearning how to respond emotionally to various morally important\nsituations. We learn to feel badly about types of things judged by\nothers to be wrong, like being unkind or dishonest, and then express\nnegative attitudes toward these things when we make moral judgments\nourselves. In these cases it would appear that the disinclination to do\nwhat is wrong and the inclination to discourage others from doing it\nare not mediated by an appreciation of the abstract content of the\njudgment and its bearing on things that we independently find\ndispleasing. The tie between moral judgment and motivation appears to\nbe direct, much like that suggested by the internalist.\n\n\nWe can see another way to view this problem by moving to an\nassessment of premise (1). This premise presupposes that if someone has\nmoral knowledge, then this person makes a moral judgment the content of\nwhich is a true proposition. It appears, then, that the premise presupposes\nthat the moral judgment in such cases is a moral belief rather than a\ndesire or an emotion or something else that cannot be literally true.\nThis position has indeed been the view of the internalists who reject\npremise (3) but accept premises (1) and (2). They agree that the moral\njudgment leads directly to a desire, but they maintain that it is in\nits content simply a belief. Should the critics of this argument accept\nthis presupposition? Here is an important reason to question it.\n\n\nWe can view \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d as distinct\nfunctional descriptions that tell us how mental states falling under\none label or the other work in interaction with other mental states\nand issue in behavior. The previous talk of directions of fit can be\ntaken to illustrate these distinct functions. We might then think of a\nmoral judgment as a complex mental state that normally exemplifies\nboth functions (Campbell 1998 and 2007). Moral judgment might be\nthought of as a natural kind in which the two functions comprise a\nhomeostatic unity (Kumar 2015). In its primitive form moral judgment\nmight have functioned simply to motivate conformity to norms learned\nin early socialization, accounting for the apparent direct association\nof moral judgments with motivation. It might later have evolved to\ntake on higher cognitive functions that incline many people to think\nof it as a moral belief. On this view it is normally both, contrary to\nthe presupposition that moral judgments are essentially beliefs. As\nsuch, moral judgments would not be disbarred from exemplifying moral\nknowledge. At the same time the position would not run afoul of Hume\u2019s\ndictum. In fact, it would be a kind of externalism, allowing that in\nabnormal cases one function or the other would not be present. For\nexample, if one is raised to believe that gay sex is wrong, one may at\nfirst continue to feel one\u2019s former emotions and motivations in this\nregard even after forming the considered belief that gay sex is not\nwrong. Or one may judge something not to be wrong but feel deep\nresentment or indignation, say when one is a woman who is unfairly\npassed over for a promotion but one does not believe at first that one\nhas been treated unfairly. In this case one\u2019s emotional and\nmotivational response, if it is sustained and leads one to form a new\nbelief, that one has been treated unfairly, may constitute a negative\nmoral judgment, even before the change in belief. (We return to this\nexample in 4.3 below.) Although these few remarks hardly demonstrate\nthe viability of this hybrid view, anyone defending premise (1) on the\nassumption that moral judgments are essentially beliefs needs to\nconsider this alternative and rule it out.\n\n The hybrid conception of moral judgment is not inconsistent with\npremise (1), if we are prepared to interpret it as implying only that\nfor moral knowledge to be possible moral judgments are sometimes\n(true) beliefs, not that they are always nothing but beliefs. Recall\npremise (1): If moral knowledge is possible, then our moral judgments\nare beliefs. If moral judgments are normally combinations of belief,\nemotion, and motivation, but are sometimes just beliefs and sometimes\njust emotional and motivational responses, then it is possible to\naccept premises (1), (2), and (3) and the possibility of moral\nknowledge. The reason is that one can accept that moral judgments can\nbe true, without either denying that moral judgments normally motivate\ndirectly or implying that moral beliefs sometimes motivate directly\nindependently of antecedent desires. This hybrid conception must be\ndistinguished from internalist theories that construe moral judgments\nas \u201cbesires\u201d (things that are necessarily beliefs and desires\u2014see\nAltham 1987). Unlike these theories the above hybrid conception allows\nthese elements to separate, as in the examples of changing one\u2019s moral\njudgment about gay sex or a failed promotion. It must also be\ndistinguished from theories that allow that moral judgments have both\nfunctions but give priority to either the belief side (Copp 2001) or\nthe expressive side (Ridge 2006). The first variety would deny that\nresponses that are emotional and motivational but are not beliefs\ncould be moral judgments, however moral in character those responses\nmight be. The second would deny that responses that are only beliefs\ncould be moral judgments in themselves. Which hybrid theory of moral\njudgment is preferable, if any, is a matter of controversy.\n",
