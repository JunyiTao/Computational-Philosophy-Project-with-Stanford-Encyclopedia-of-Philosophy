    "main_text": "Fazang (643\u2013712) || Analysis of Dharmas\n4.3 Analysis of Dharmas\n\nIn the third section of the tenth chapter of Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan, Fazang offers eight theses on\ndharmas as dependently-arisen causes. Four theses concern\ndharmas with respect to their different substance\n(dharmas as they relate to all other dharmas): each\ndharma includes all others, is included within all others,\ndetermines the identity of all others, and has its identity determined\nby all others. The remaining four concern dharmas with\nrespect to their same substance (dharmas as they relate to\nthe totality of the dharma-realm of dependent arising): each\ndharma includes the totality of dharmas, is included\nwithin the totality, determines the identity of the totality, and has\nits identity determined by the totality. \n\nFazang\u2019s theses involve two salient posits. The first is that\nevery dharma simultaneously has the aspects of existing and\nbeing empty. As existing, each dharma appears as an\nindividual that is (numerically) distinct from others. As empty, each\ndharma lacks any sort of self-nature that would render it\ninvulnerable to others. Fazang\u2019s second posit is that every\ndharma also simultaneously has the aspects of having power\nand lacking power. As powerful, each dharma affects others in\nways beyond their control and despite their resistance. As powerless,\neach dharma is vulnerable to others, affected by them in ways\nbeyond its own control and despite its resistance. Fazang uses these\nposits to argue that insofar as one dharma exists or has\npower, the others are empty and lack power; and that insofar as one\ndharma is empty or lacking power, the others exist and have\npower. His theses about mutual inclusion and identity follow as\ncorollaries. \n\nFazang offers several metaphors to elucidate his claims about mutual\ninclusion and identity, such as the metaphor of Indra\u2019s net and\nthe metaphor of counting ten coins. The most developed metaphor occurs\nin the fourth and final section of the tenth chapter of Treatise\non the Five Teachings of Huayan, where Fazang uses a metaphor of\na framed building to explain six characteristics of dharmas\nas dependently-arisen causes (Fazang 2014b). Fazang labels the six\ncharacteristics as wholeness, particularity, identity, difference,\nintegration, and disintegration. Each of these pertains to some\ncharacteristic an individual dharma has as a part of some\nintegrated whole, akin to the relation a rafter bears to a building.\nFazang\u2019s explanations are notoriously dense. Roughly speaking,\nit seems that a dharma has wholeness insofar as it creates\nsome whole; particularity insofar as it is numerically distinct from\nthat whole; identity insofar as it includes all other parts of the\nwhole; difference insofar as it is numerically distinct from those\nothers; integration insofar as its creating the whole does not\ninterfere with every other dharma of the whole doing the\nsame; and disintegration insofar as its creative success does not\ndepend upon the cooperation of other dharmas in the whole.\n\n",
