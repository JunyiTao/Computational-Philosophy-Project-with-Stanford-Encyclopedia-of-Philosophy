    "main_text": "Scope of Skeptical Theism || Humean Arguments\n7.2 Humean Arguments\n\nSome of the most powerful arguments from evil are Humean arguments\nfrom evil (see Hume 1779 [2007], Draper 1989, Draper 1992:\n313\u2013317, Dougherty and Draper 2013, Morriston 2014). Humean\narguments have several distinctive features. First, they appeal to\nfacts about good and evil, such as the distribution of\npleasure and pain we observe. Second, they are comparative: they\ncompare theism with some alternative, inconsistent hypothesis like a\n\u201chypothesis of indifference\u201d (roughly: it is not the case\nthat life on earth as we observe it is the result of actions by either\na benevolent or maleficent creator). Third, they are normally\nabductive, arguing that the inconsistent hypothesis does a better job\nof explaining certain facts than theism.\n\nHumean arguments normally have a central premise like:\n\nDistribution (Dist)\n\nThe hypothesis of indifference does a much better job predicting the\ndistribution of pleasure and pain we observe than theism.\n\nOn its own, Dist isn\u2019t enough to make it\nreasonable to believe theism is false; after all, perhaps the\nhypothesis of indifference is worse off in other respects\u2014it is\nvery implausible or we have other excellent reasons for accepting\ntheism (cf. Plantinga 1996: 247\u2013250). So defenders of Humean\narguments normally add additional premises to their argument to show\nthat their rival to theism isn\u2019t worse off in other respects as\nwell (see Dougherty and Draper 2013: 69ff; Morriston 2014: 227). But\nthe inclusion of a comparative premise like Dist is\npart of what makes Humean arguments distinctive.\n\nDist may be defended in various ways. One standard\nway appeals to our background knowledge of the biological role of\npleasure and pain (Draper 1989). Simplifying, we antecedently know\nthat pleasure\u2014a good\u2014and pain\u2014an evil\u2014play\nbiological roles. For instance, pleasure will play a role in\nreinforcing adaptive behavior, whereas pain will play a role in\ndeterring non-adaptive behavior. The hypothesis of indifference does\nnot undermine predictions about the biological role of pleasure and\npain. But theism will. For given theism it is expectable that pleasure\nand pain would play additional roles beyond biological ones such as\nmoral or religious roles (e.g., the virtuous receive pleasure, the\nvicious pain). So theism, but not the hypothesis of indifference, will\nundermine the predictions about the biological role of pleasure and\npain. Further, the argument goes, those predictions are accurate.\nThus, the hypothesis of indifference does a better job of explaining\nDist than theism.\n\nMost skeptical theists object to claims like Dist by\nfocusing on what theism predicts or explains. Some skeptical theists\nexpress general skepticism of our ability to effectively compare these\nhypotheses. For instance, Perrine (2019) argues that if theism is\ntrue, then skeptical theistic claims\u2014like\nST1\u2013ST3\nfrom above\u2014are also very likely true. Thus, if\nDist is true, then so is:\n\nDistribution+ (Dist+)\n\nThe hypothesis of indifference does a much better job predicting the\ndistribution of pleasure and pain we observe than theism and skeptical\ntheistic claims.\n\nBut it is doubtful that we are able to effectively predict the\npleasure and pain we might observe given both theism and skeptical\ntheistic claims. For skeptical theistic claims undermine our ability\nto create precise enough predictions about theism to effectively\ncompare them with other hypotheses like the hypothesis of\nindifference.\n\nOther skeptical theistic critiques of Dist focus on\nspecific hypotheses that, it seems, we cannot reasonably rule out. For\ninstance, consider the following claim (compare Van Inwagen 1991\n[1996]; and 1996: 225\u2013234):\n\nNecessary Distribution (ND)\n\nA distribution of pleasure and pain for organisms similar to the one\nwe observe is necessary for great goods associated with higher-level\norganisms and for avoiding disvaluable worlds that are\nmassively irregular.\n\nIf ND is very probable, given theism, then it is not\nunlikely that we would observe a distribution of pleasure and\npain similar to the one we observe. For if theism is true, God likely\nwants to bring about various greater goods. But if ND\nis true, God couldn\u2019t bring about those greater goods without\nallowing for a distribution of pleasures and pains similar to the one\nwe observe. Thus, if ND is very probable, given\ntheism, then theism may predict the distribution of good and evil we\nobserve just as well as the hypothesis of indifference. Thus, if it is\nreasonable to believe Dist it must also be reasonable\nto believe that ND is not very probable,\ngiven theism. But that hypothesis\u2014that ND is\nnot very probable, given theism\u2014is not one we can reasonably\nrule out. To do that, we would have to have a greater understanding of\ngoods, evils, their connections to organisms, laws of natures,\nirregularities, etc. than we in fact have. So it is unreasonable to\nbelieve Dist, since to reasonably believe it we would\nhave to reasonably believe ND is not very probable\ngiven theism, and that\u2019s not reasonable for us to believe.\n",
