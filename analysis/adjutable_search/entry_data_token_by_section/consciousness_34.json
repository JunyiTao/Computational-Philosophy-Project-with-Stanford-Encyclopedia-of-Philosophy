    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Higher-order theories\n9.1 Higher-order theories\n\n\nHigher-order (HO) theories analyze the notion of a conscious mental\nstate in terms of reflexive meta-mental self-awareness. The core idea\nis that what makes a mental state M a conscious mental state is the\nfact that it is accompanied by a simultaneous and non-inferential\nhigher-order (i.e., meta-mental) state whose content is that one is now\nin M. Having a conscious desire for some chocolate involves being in\ntwo mental states; one must have both a desire for some chocolate and\nalso a higher-order state whose content is that one is now having just\nsuch a desire. Unconscious mental states are unconscious precisely in\nthat we lack the relevant higher-order states about them. Their being\nunconscious consists in the fact that we are not reflexively and\ndirectly aware of being in them. (See the entry on\n higher-order theories of consciousness.)\n\n\nHigher-order theories come in two main variants that differ\nconcerning the psychological mode of the relevant conscious-making\nmeta-mental states. Higher-order thought (HOT) theories take the\nrequired higher-order state to be an assertoric thought-like meta-state\n(Rosenthal 1986, 1993). Higher-order perception (HOP) theories take\nthem to be more perception-like and associated with a kind of inner\nsense and intra-mental monitoring systems of some sort (Armstrong 1981,\nLycan 1987, 1996).\n\n\nEach has its relative strengths and problems. HOT theorists note\nthat we have no organs of inner sense and claim that we experience no\nsensory qualities other than those presented to us by outer directed\nperception. HOP theorists on the other hand can argue that their view\nexplains some of the additional conditions required by HO accounts as\nnatural consequences of the perception-like nature of the relevant\nhigher-order states. In particular the demands that the\nconscious-making meta-state be noninferential and simultaneous with its\nlower level mental object might be explained by the parallel conditions\nthat typically apply to perception. We perceive what is happening now,\nand we do so in a way that involves no inferences, at least not any\nexplicit personal-level inferences. Those conditions are no less\nnecessary on the HOT view but are left unexplained by it, which might\nseem to give some explanatory advantage to the HOP model (Lycan 2004,\nVan Gulick 2000), though some HOT theorists argue otherwise (Carruthers\n2000).\n\n\nWhatever their respective merits, both HOP and HOT theories face some\ncommon challenges, including what might be called thegenerality\nproblem. Having a thought or perception of a given\nitem X\u2014be it a rock, a pen or a potato\u2014does not\nin general make X a conscious X. Seeing or thinking\nof the potato on the counter does not make it a conscious potato. Why\nthen should having a thought or perception of a given desire or a\nmemory make it a conscious desire or memory (Dretske 1995, Byrne\n1997). Nor will it suffice to note that we do not apply the term\n\u201cconscious\u201d to rocks or pens that we perceive or think of,\nbut only to mental states that we perceive or think of (Lycan 1997,\nRosenthal 1997). That may be true, but what is needed is some account\nof why it is appropriate to do so.\n\n\nThe higher-order view is most obviously relevant to the meta-mental\nforms of consciousness, but some of its supporters take it to explain\nother types of consciousness as well, including the more subjective\nwhat it's like and qualitative types. One common strategy is to analyze\nqualia as mental features that are capable of occurring unconsciously;\nfor example they might be explained as properties of inner states whose\nstructured similarity relations given rise to beliefs about objective\nsimilarities in the world (Shoemaker 1975, 1990). Though unconscious\nqualia can play that functional role, there need be nothing that it is\nlike to be in a state that has them (Nelkin 1989, Rosenthal 1991,\n1997). According to the HO theorist, what-it's-likeness enters\nonly when we become aware of that first-order state and its qualitative\nproperties by having an appropriate meta-state directed at it.\n\n\nCritics of the HO view have disputed that account, and some have\nargued that the notion of unconscious qualia on which it relies is\nincoherent (Papineau 2002). Whether or not such proposed HO accounts of\nqualia are successful, it is important to note that most HO advocates\ntake themselves to be offering a comprehensive theory of consciousness,\nor at least the core of such a general theory, rather than merely one\nlimited to some special meta-mental forms of it.\n\n\nOther variants of HO theory go beyond the standard HOT and HOP\nversions including some that analyze consciousness in terms of\ndispositional rather than occurrent higher-order thoughts (Carruthers\n2000). Others appeal to implicit rather than explicit higher-order\nunderstanding and weaken or remove the standard assumption that the\nmeta-state must be distinct and separate from its lower-order object\n(Gennaro 1995, Van Gulick 2000, 2004) with such views overlapping with\nso called reflexive theories discussed in the section. Other variants\nof HO theory continue to be offered, and debate between supporters and\ncritics of the basic approach remains active. (See the recent papers\nin Gennaro 2004.)\n",
