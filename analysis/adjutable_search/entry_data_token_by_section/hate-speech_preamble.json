    "main_text": "\n\nHate speech is a concept that many people find intuitively easy to\ngrasp, while at the same time many others deny it is even a coherent\nconcept. A majority of developed, democratic nations have enacted hate\nspeech legislation\u2014with the contemporary United States being a\nnotable outlier\u2014and so implicitly maintain that it is coherent,\nand that its conceptual lines can be drawn distinctly enough.\nNonetheless, the concept of hate speech does indeed raise many\ndifficult questions: What does the \u2018hate\u2019 in hate speech\nrefer to? Can hate speech be directed at dominant groups, or is it by\ndefinition targeted at oppressed or marginalized communities? Is hate\nspeech always \u2018speech\u2019? What is the harm or harms of hate\nspeech? And, perhaps most challenging of all, what can or should be\ndone to counteract hate speech?\n\nIn part because of these complexities, hate speech has spawned a vast\nand interdisciplinary literature. Legal scholars, philosophers,\nsociologists, anthropologists, political theorists, historians, and\nother academics have each approached the topic with exceeding\ninterest. In this current article, however, we cannot hope to cover\nhow these many disciplines have engaged with the concept of hate\nspeech. Here, we will focus most explicitly on how hate speech has\nbeen taken up within philosophy, with particular emphasis on issues\nsuch as: how to define hate speech; what are the plausible harms of\nhate speech; how an account of hate speech might include both overt\nexpressions of hate (e.g., the vitriolic use of slurs) as well as more\ncovert, implicit utterances (e.g., dogwhistles); the relationship\nbetween hate speech and silencing; and what might we do to counteract\nhate speech.\n",
