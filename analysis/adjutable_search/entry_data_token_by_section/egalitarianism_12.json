Alternatives to Egalitarianism\n\n\nWhy should it matter that people have or get the same? In previous\nsections of this entry some attempt has been made to clarify some\nprinciples that prize equality of condition of some sort. No doubt in\nsome circumstances movement toward equality of some sort can be\nexpected to increase the extent to which other values worth caring\nabout are achieved. The question here is whether the achievement of\nequality of condition of any sort matters for its own sake,\nindependently of whether it hinders or promotes the attainment of other\nvalues.\n\n\nWhat has been called the \u201cleveling-down objection\u201d\nsuggests a reason to answer in the negative: everyone's being\nequal is not valuable for its own sake. Suppose the universe contains\ntwo persons, one of whom is far better off than the other. If we can\neffect a change, perhaps by transferring resources, that will make the\nworse off person better off and make the better off person worse off,\nprovided the change does not bring it about that the formerly better\noff person is now worse off, the change will bring the people closer to\nbeing equally well off. So equality recommends the change, at least if\nother things are equal. This seems plausible. But now suppose we can\neffect a change that will make the better off person worse off without\nmaking anyone else better off, and without making it the case that the\nformerly better off person is now worse off. Perhaps the better off\nperson has a nice house, and we can burn down the house costlessly,\nmaking him worse off, but without improving the condition of anyone\nelse. This is leveling down. If equality is non-instrumentally\nvaluable, then the situation that obtains after leveling down must be\nin at least one respect better than the preceding situation: the new\nsituation is more equal. The objection simply is that it is\ncounterintuitive to claim that in any respect increasing equality by\nmaking someone worse off and no one else better off is improving the\nsituation. Leveling down is pointless or worse.\n\n\nAs stated, the leveling down objection invites the reply by the\negalitarian that the situation after leveling down is indeed in one\nrespect better than the situation previously obtaining: after all, we\nnow have greater equality or a closer approximation to a condition of\nequality. We may have a standoff of conflicting moral intuitions. Those\nwho doubt that equality is non-instrumentally valuable offer this\ndiagnosis. When we envisage a more equal world, we tend to think of\nchanges that make some people better off\u2014those who before got the\nshort end of the stick now are made better off so that equality across\npersons is approached. We also tend to envisage situations in which\nthose who are worse off than others are badly off in non-comparative\nterms. In this way we tend to run together (1) people being more equal\nand (2) the worse off (who are likely badly off) becoming better off.\nBy a halo effect, the goodness of 2 appears to shine on 1. Once we see\nclearly that having equality and making gains toward equality need have\nnothing to do with 2, we see that we had all along we had been\nmisjudging the value of 1, and so our considered judgment should be\nthat it is not the case that equality of any sort is non-instrumentally\nvaluable (Parfit 1991, Temkin 1993, and Holtug 2010, chapter 7).\n\n\nIn considering this question, one should beware of conflating\nequality per se with distinct and independent values that in some\ncircumstances will closely shadow it. The values that might be\nconfounded with equality include sufficiency, priority, and desert.\n",
