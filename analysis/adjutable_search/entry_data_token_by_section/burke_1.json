    "main_text": "Life\n2. Life\n\n\nBurke was born at Dublin in Ireland, then part of the British Empire,\nthe son of a prosperous attorney, and, after an early education at\nhome, became a boarder at the school run by Abraham Shackleton, a\nQuaker from Yorkshire, at Ballitore in County Kildare. Burke received\nhis university education at Trinity College, Dublin, a bastion of the\nAnglican Church of Ireland. Thence he proceeded to the Middle Temple\nat London, in order to qualify for the Bar, but legal practice was\nless attractive to him than the broader perspective which had captured\nhis attention at university (or earlier). It was first as a writer,\nand then as a public figure that he made his career. Burke\u2019s\nintellectual formation did not suggest that his career would be purely\nphilosophical. Indeed, for those without an independent income or a\nclerical vocation\u00a0 such a way of life was not very feasible in\nBritain or Ireland. Only the Scottish universities offered posts that\ndid not require holy orders, but they were not very receptive to\nnon-presbyterians. Burke married in 1756, and had a son by 1758, so\nthat a career of Humean celibacy, in which philosophy was cultivated\non a little oatmeal, was not for him.\n\n\nIndeed, like Hume, Burke found that there was more money in\nnarrative works and in practical affairs than in philosophy. Burke\u2019s\nearliest writings include A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin\nof our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757), and A\nVindication of Natural Society (1756). Thereafter he was co-author\nof An Account of the European Settlements (1757) and began\nAn Abridgement of English History (c.1757\u201362). From 1758, at\nleast until 1765, he was the principal \u2018conductor\u2019 of the\nnew Annual Register. In 1765, Burke became private secretary\nto the Marquis of Rockingham (who had just become First Lord of\nthe Treasury) and was elected to the British House of Commons in the\nsame year. He remained there, with a brief intermission in the Autumn\nof 1780, for nearly twenty-nine years, retiring in the Summer of 1794.\nBurke, who was always a prominent figure there and sometimes an\neffective persuader, gave a great many parliamentary speeches. He\npublished versions of some of these, notably on American\nTaxation (1774), Conciliation with America (1775), and\nFox\u2019s East India Bill (1783). These printed speeches, though\nanchored to specific occasions, and certainly intended to have a\npractical effect in British politics, were also meant to embody\nBurke\u2019s thought in a durable form. In that respect, they parallel\nhis Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770),\nand Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), amongst\nother non-oratorical writings.\n\n\nBurke\u2019s activity as a parliamentarian and political writer embraced a\ngreat many concerns. Prominent amongst these were the problems of\nBritish rule overseas, in North America, India and Ireland. His name,\nhowever, has been linked most strongly by posterity to a critique of\nthe French Revolution. Burke was certainly more notable as a pundit\nthan an executive politician, holding office only twice, for a few\nmonths in 1782 and 1783. His political life was punctuated in May 1791\nby a break from some of his party colleagues over the significance of\nthe Revolution. Thereafter, assisted not least by the turn it took in\n1792\u20133, he became a largely independent commentator on domestic\npolitics and international affairs in An Appeal from the New to\nthe Old Whigs (1791), Letters on a Regicide Peace\n(1795\u20137), and A Letter to a Noble Lord (1796). Burke in\nhis last years, especially from 1792, turned his attention to his\nnative Ireland. He failed to found a political dynasty, and he left no\nlasting school in parliamentary politics: the last politician who can\nbe regarded plausibly as a disciple, the addressee of A Letter to\nWilliam Elliot (1795), died in 1818. As Sidgwick observed,\n\u2018though Burke lives, we meet with no Burkites\u2019 (Sidgwick\n1877 [2000, 195]). Nor did Burke bequeath a straightforward legacy to\nany political party or to any ideological brand of thought, though\nplenty have tried to appropriate him wholly or partly. The\ndifficulties that they might find in colonising his thought are\napparent from an account of it that emphasizes its philosophical\naspects.\n",
