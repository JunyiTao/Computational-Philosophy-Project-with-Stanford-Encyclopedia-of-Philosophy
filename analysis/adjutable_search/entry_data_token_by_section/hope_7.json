    "main_text": "The Philosophical History of Hope || Pragmatism\n2.6 Pragmatism\n\nEven though hope rarely features explicitly in pragmatist writings, it\nhas been suggested that pragmatist accounts of hope can be found in\nthe works of William James and John Dewey (Fishman and McCarthy 2007;\nGreen 2008; Koopman 2006, 2009; Rorty 1999; Shade 2001). As Patrick\nShade notes, the issue of hope is \u201cimplicit in most pragmatic\nphilosophies\u201d, as it is related to central pragmatist topics,\nsuch as meliorism and faith, and particular hopes for social progress\n(Shade 2001: 9f.). Sarah Stitzlein (2020) argues that a conception of\nhope as a set of habits unites the understanding of hope in the\nwritings of the classical pragmatists (Charles Peirce, William James,\nJohn Dewey) and is further developed in the social and political\nwritings of recent pragmatists (Richard Rorty, Judith Green, Cornel\nWest, Patrick Shade, Colin Koopman).\n\nIndeed, James\u2019 concept of faith in The Will to Believe\nis closely linked to hope. In his essay, James aims to offer a\n\u201cjustification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a\nbelieving attitude in religious matters\u201d (James [1897] 2015: 1).\nEven though his primary subject is religious faith, he points out that\na structurally similar justification of faith or trust can be applied\nto social questions. It can be rational to believe that the other is\ntrustworthy or likes us, even though we may not be able to prove it.\nThree criteria have to be fulfilled for faith to be rational: the\nquestion cannot be decided scientifically, the belief may be true, and\nwe are better off (even now) if we believe. In his argument, James\ndraws a link to the concept of hope when claiming that the skeptic or\nagnostic attitude is not more rational than the attitude of faith. The\nskeptic holds \u201cthat to yield to our fear of its being error is\nwiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may be true\u201d\n(James [1897] 2015: 27). James criticizes this attitude: \u201cwhat\nproof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery\nthrough fear?\u201d (James [1897] 2015: 27).\n\nA pragmatist conception of hope has often been seen as closely linked\nto the idea of meliorism and progress (e.g., in Dewey\u2019s work,\nsee Shade 2001: 139). In his lectures on Pragmatism, James\nsituates the doctrine of meliorism between pessimism and optimism:\n\u201cMeliorism treats salvation as neither necessary nor impossible.\nIt treats it as a possibility\u201d (James 2000: 125). For Dewey, the\nobject of hope or meliorism is first and foremost democracy, which is\n\u201cthe simple idea that political and ethical progress hinges on\nnothing more than persons, their values, and their actions\u201d\n(Dewey [1916] 1980: 107).\n\nDrawing on James\u2019 account of conversion in the Varieties of\nReligious Experience, Sheehey argues that James can be seen as\nadvocating a concept of hope that does not rely on the idea of\nprogress, but relies on a \u201ctemporality of crisis\u201d that\nallows for an understanding of historical change beyond progress or\ndecline (Sheehey 2019).\n",
