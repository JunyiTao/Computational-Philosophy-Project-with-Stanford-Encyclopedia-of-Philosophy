Galileo\u2019s Scientific Story\n\nThe philosophical thread that runs through Galileo\u2019s\nintellectual life is a strong and increasing desire to find a new\nconception of what constitutes natural philosophy and how natural\nphilosophy ought to be pursued. Galileo signaled this goal clearly\nwhen he left Padua in 1610 to return to Florence and the court of the\nMedici. He asked for and received the designation\n\u2018Philosopher\u2019, in addition to \u2018Mathematician\u2019.\nThis was not just a status-affirming request, but also a reflection of\nhis programmatic aims. What Galileo accomplished by the end of his\nlife was a reasonably articulated replacement for the traditional set\nof analytical concepts connected with the Aristotelian tradition of\nnatural philosophy. He offered, in place of the Aristotelian\ncategories, a set of mechanical archetypes that were accepted by most\neveryone who afterwards developed the \u201cnew sciences,\u201d and\nwhich, in some form or another, became the hallmark of the new\nphilosophy. His way of thinking became the way of the Scientific\nRevolution (and yes, there was such a revolution, pace Shapin\n1996 and others; see the selections in Lindberg and Westman 1990;\nOsler 2000).\n\nSome scholars might wish to describe what Galileo achieved in\npsychological terms, as an introduction of new mental models (Palmieri\n2003) or a new model of intelligibility (Machamer 1994; Machamer,\n1998a; Adams, et al. 2017). However phrased, Galileo\u2019s main move\nwas to dethrone the Aristotelian physical categories; namely, the one\ncelestial element (aether, or quintessence\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cfifth element\u201d) and the four terrestrial ones (fire, air,\nwater, and earth), along with their respective motive natures\n(circular, and up and down). In their place, he left only one\nelement, corporeal matter, whose properties and motions he described\nusing the mathematics of proportional relations typified by the\nArchimedian simple machines\u2014the balance, the inclined plane, and\nthe lever\u2014to which Galileo added the pendulum (Machamer 1998a;\nMachamer and Hepburn 2004; Palmieri 2008). In doing so, Galileo\nchanged the acceptable way of talking about matter and its motion, and\nso ushered in the mechanical tradition that characterizes so much of\nmodern science, even today. See Dijksterhuis 1961; Machamer, et al.\n2000; Gaukroger 2006; Roux and Garber 2013.\n\nAs a way of understanding Galileo\u2019s accomplishments, it is\nuseful to see him as being interested in finding a unified theory of\nmatter\u2014a mathematical theory of the material stuff that\nconstitutes the whole of the cosmos. Perhaps he did not realize that\nthis was his grand project until the time he actually wrote the\nTwo New Sciences in the mid-1630s. Despite working on\nproblems of the nature of matter from 1590 onwards, he could not have\nwritten his final work much earlier than 1638; certainly not\nbefore the Starry Messenger of 1610, and probably\nnot before the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World\nSystems of 1632. He had thought deeply about the nature of\nmatter before 1610 and had tried to work out how best to describe\nmatter, but before 1632, he did not have the theory and evidence he\nneeded to support his claims about a unified, singular matter. The\nidea of unified matter theory had to wait for the\nestablishment of principles of matter\u2019s motion on a moving\nEarth. And this he did not accomplish until\nthe Dialogue.\n\nGalileo began his critique of Aristotle in a treatise he drafted\naround 1590, titled De Motu (On Motion). The\nfirst part of this manuscript deals with terrestrial matter and argues\nthat Aristotle\u2019s theory has it wrong. For Aristotle, the matter\nof the terrestrial realm within the sphere of the moon is of four\nelemental kinds\u2014earth, water, air, and fire. These possess two\nformal principles that give rise to their natural motion: heaviness\n(gravitas; in earth and water) and lightness\n(levitas; in air and fire). Galileo, using an Archimedean\nmodel of floating bodies, and later the balance, argues that there is\nonly one principle of motion\u2014heaviness. Bodies move upward not\nbecause they have a natural lightness, he says, but because they are\ndisplaced or extruded by other heavier bodies moving downward. So on\nhis view, heaviness is the cause of all natural terrestrial\nmotion.\n\nThis move left Galileo with a problem: what is heaviness and how is it\nto be described? In De Motu, he argued that the moving\narms of a balance could be used as a model for treating all problems\nof natural motion. In this model, heaviness is the proportionality of\nthe weight of an object on one arm of the balance to the weight of\nanother body on the other arm. In the context of floating bodies,\nheaviness is the weight of one body minus the weight of the medium.\nGalileo quickly realized these characterizations were insufficient,\nand so began to explore how heaviness might be related to specific\ngravities; i.e., the comparative weights of bodies having equal\nvolume. He was trying to figure out the concept of heaviness that is\ncharacteristic of all matter. What he failed to work out\u2014and\nthis was probably the reason why he never published De\nMotu\u2014was this positive characterization of heaviness. There\nseemed to be no way to find a standard measure of heaviness that would\nwork across different substances. At this point, he did not have a\nuseful replacement for Aristotelian gravitas.\n\nA while later, in his 1600 manuscript version of Le\nMeccaniche (On Mechanics), Galileo introduced the\nconcept of momento, a quasi force\nthat applies to a body at a moment, and which is somehow proportional\nto weight or specific gravity (Galluzzi 1979). Still, he had no good\nway to measure or compare specific gravities of bodies of different\nkinds, and his notebooks during this early seventeenth-century period\nreflect his trying again and again to find a way to bring all matter\nunder a single proportional measuring scale. He tried to study\nacceleration along an inclined plane and to find a way to think of\nwhat changes acceleration brings to momento. Yet the details\nand categories of how to properly treat weight and movement eluded\nhim.\n\nWe see from this period that Galileo\u2019s law of free fall arises\nout of this struggle to find the proper categories for his new science\nof matter and motion. Galileo accepted, probably as early as the 1594\ndraft of Le Meccaniche, that natural motions might be\naccelerated. Particularly in the cases of the pendulum, the inclined\nplane, free fall, and projectile motion, Galileo must have observed\nthat the speeds of bodies increase as they move downwards and,\nperhaps, do so naturally. But that accelerated motion is properly\nmeasured against time is an idea he realized only later, chiefly\nthrough his failure to find any satisfactory dependence on place and\nspecific gravity. Also at this time, he began to think about\npercussive force. For many years, he thought that the correct science\nof these phenomena should describe how bodies change according to\nwhere they are on their paths. Specifically, it seemed that height is\ncrucial. Percussive force is directly related to height and the motion\nof the pendulum seems to involve equilibrium with respect to the\nheight of the bob (and time also, but isochrony did not lead directly\nto a recognition of time\u2019s importance).\n\nOne of Galileo\u2019s problems was that the Archimedian simple\nmachines he was using as his models of intelligibility, especially the\nbalance, are not easily conceived of in a dynamic way (but see\nMachamer and Woody 1994). Since they generally work by establishing\nstatic equilibrium, time is not a feature of their action one would\nnormally attend to. In discussing a balance, for instance, one does\nnot normally think about how fast an arm of the balance descends, nor\nhow fast a body on the opposite arm is rising (though Galileo does in\nhis Postils to Rocco circa 1634\u201345; see\nPalmieri 2005). The converse is also true. It is difficult to model\ndynamic phenomena that involve rates of change as balance arms moving\nupwards or downwards because of differential weights. So it was that\nGalileo\u2019s puzzle about how to describe time and the force of\npercussion (the force of body\u2019s impact) would remain unsolved.\nThroughout his life, he could not find systematic relations among\nspecific gravities, heights of fall, and percussive forces. Even while\nthe Two New Sciences was going to press in 1638, Galileo was\nlaboring on an additional \u201cFifth Day\u201d (not published until\n1718) that presciently explored the concept of the force of\npercussion, which would become, after his death, one of the most\nfecund ways to think about matter and its motion.\n\nIn the period 1603\u20139, Galileo experimented with inclined planes\nand, most importantly, pendulums. These studies again exhibited to\nGalileo that acceleration and, therefore, time is a crucial variable.\nMoreover, the isochrony of the pendulum\u2014the period depends only\non the length of the cord, regardless of the weight of the\nbob\u2014went some way towards showing that time is a possible term\nin the equilibrium (or ratio) that needs to be made explicit to\nrepresent motion. It also shows that, in at least one case, time can\ndisplace weight as a crucial variable.\n\nThe law of free fall\u2014i.e., a body in free fall from rest\ntraverses a distance proportional to the square of the time\nelapsed\u2014was discovered by Galileo through the inclined plane\nexperiments (Drake 1999, v. 2). At first, Galileo attempted to\nrepresent this phenomenon with a velocity-distance relation, and the\nequivalent mean proportional relation. His later and correct\ndefinition of natural acceleration dependent on time was an insight\ngained through recognizing the physical significance of that mean\nproportional relation (Machamer and Hepburn 2004; for a different\nanalysis of Galileo\u2019s discovery of free fall see Renn, et al.\n2000). Yet Galileo would not publish anything making time central to\nhis analysis of motion until 1638, in the Two New\nSciences.\n\nIn 1609, Galileo began his work with the telescope. There are many\nways to describe Galileo\u2019s findings, and many interpreters have\ntaken this to be an interlude irrelevant to his physics. However,\nthey are remarkable insofar as they are his start at dismantling the\ncelestial-terrestrial distinction entrenched in Aristotelian cosmology\n(Feyerabend 1975). Perhaps the most unequivocal case of this is when\nhe analogizes the mountains on the moon to mountains in Bohemia in the\nStarry Messenger. Also crucial was his discovery of the four\nmoons circling Jupiter, which lent credence to the Copernican system\nsince it meant that a planet-moon arrangement was not unique to the\nEarth. The abandonment of the dichotomy between heavens and earth\nimplied that all matter, whether celestial or terrestrial, is of the\nsame kind. Further, if there is only one kind of matter, there can be\nonly one kind of natural motion\u2014one kind of motion that this\nmatter has by nature. So it has to be that one law of motion will hold\nthroughout the terrestrial and celestial realms. This is a far\nstronger claim than he had made in 1590, which concerned only the\nterrestrial elements.\n\nA few years later, in his Letters on\nSunspots (1613), Galileo offered new telescopic evidence\nthat supported the Copernican theory. But these observations also\nserved as additional reasons for dissolving the celestial-terrestrial\ndistinction. One was that the sun is not an immutable aetherial\nsphere, but has changing spots (maculae) on its surface.\nAnother was that the sun rotates circularly around its axis, like the\nEarth. A third was the discovery that Venus undergoes a full sequence\nof phases (like the moon), which entails that Venus revolves around\nthe sun, and suggests that the Earth is likewise a celestial body\nmoving around the sun. Certainly the phases of Venus contradicted the\nPtolemaic ordering of the planets.\n\nLater, in 1623, Galileo argued for a quite mistaken material thesis.\nIn The Assayer, he tried to show that comets are\nsublunary phenomena and that their properties could be explained by\noptical refraction. While this work stands as a masterpiece of\nscientific rhetoric, it is somewhat strange that Galileo should have\nargued against the superlunary nature of comets, which the great\nDanish astronomer Tycho Brahe had demonstrated earlier.\n\nYet even with all these developments, Galileo still needed to work out\ngeneral principles concerning the nature of motion for this newly\nunified matter. In this respect, Galileo differed from Ptolemy (at\nleast of the Almagest), Copernicus, or even Tycho Brahe, who\ntreated their planetary systems\u2014be they Earth- or\nsun-centered\u2014merely as models of the planets\u2019 observed\nmotions; that is, as mathematical conceits for calculating observable\npositions. For Galileo, by contrast, Copernicanism was also a\ncommitment to a physically realizable cosmography. Consequently, he\nneeded to work out, at least qualitatively, a way of thinking about\nthe actual motions of matter. He had to devise (or shall we say,\ndiscover) principles of local motion that would fit a central sun,\nplanets moving around that sun, a whirling Earth, and everything on\nit.\n\nThis he did by introducing two new principles. In Day One of\nhis Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World\nSystems (1632), Galileo argues that matter will move\nnaturally along circular trajectories, neither speeding up nor slowing\ndown. Then, in Day Two, he introduces his version of the famous\nprinciple of the relativity of observed motion. This latter holds that\nobservers cannot detect uniform motions they share with objects under\nobservation; only differential motion can be seen. Of course, neither\nof these principles was entirely original with Galileo. They had\npredecessors. But no one needed them for the reasons that he did,\nnamely that they were necessitated by a unified cosmological\nmatter.\n\nOne key effect of these principles is that the diurnal terrestrial\nrotation asserted by the Copernican system is unobservable. The Earth\nand all the objects on it naturally move in circles around the\nEarth\u2019s axis once a day, but since human observers share this\nmotion, it cannot be detected. We only notice departures from shared\nrotation, such as bodies falling or rising. Consequently, \u201call\nexperiments practicable upon the Earth are insufficient\nmeasures\u201d for proving its stability or its mobility,\n\u201csince they are indifferently adaptable to an Earth in motion or\nat rest\u201d (Galilei 1967, 6). This blunted standard objections to\nCopernicanism on the grounds that there is no evidence of terrestrial\nmotion.\n\nHaving dispelled these arguments against the Copernican system,\nGalileo then dramatically argues in its favor. In Day Three of the\nDialogue. Salviati, Galileo\u2019s avatar, has Simplicio,\nthe ever-astounded Aristotelian, make use of astronomical\nobservations, especially the facts that Venus has phases and that\nVenus and Mercury are never far from the sun, to construct a diagram\nof the planetary positions. The resulting diagram neatly corresponds\nto the Copernican model. Then in Day Four, Galileo offers a supposed\nproof of Copernican theory on the basis of the tides, asserting that\nthey result from the combination of the Earth\u2019s diurnal rotation\nand its annual motion around the sun.\n\nIn the Dialogue, things are more complicated than we\nhave just sketched. Galileo, as noted, argues for circular natural\nmotion. Yet he also introduces, in places, an intrinsic tendency for\nrectilinear motion. For example, Galileo recognizes that a stone\nwhirled circularly in a sling would fly off along the rectilinear\ntangent if released (Galilei 1967, 189\u201394; see Hooper 1998).\nFurther, in Day Four, when he is giving his mechanical explanation of\nthe tides, he nuances his matter theory by attributing to water an\nadditional power of retaining an impetus for motion such that it can\ngenerate a reciprocal movement once it is sloshed against a side of a\nbasin. This was not Galileo\u2019s first dealing with water. We saw\nit first in the De Motu around 1590, where Galileo\ndiscusses submerged and floating bodies, but he learned much more in\nhis dispute over floating bodies (which produced the Discourse on\nFloating Bodies in 1612). In fact, a large part of that debate\nturned on the exact nature of water as matter, and what kind of\nmathematical proportionality could be used to correctly describe it\nand bodies moving in it (see Palmieri 1998; 2004).\n\nThe final chapter of Galileo\u2019s scientific story came in 1638,\nwith the publication of the Two New Sciences. The second\nscience, discussed in the last two Days, deals with the principles of\nlocal motion and has been much commented upon in the Galilean\nliterature. But the first science, discussed in the first two Days,\nhas been misunderstood and infrequently discussed. It has misleadingly\nbeen called the science of the strength of materials, and so seems to\nhave found a place in history of engineering, since such a course is\nstill taught today. However, this science is not about the strength of\nmaterials per se. It is Galileo\u2019s attempt to\nprovide a mathematical science of his unified matter (see Machamer\n1998a; Biener 2004; Machamer and Hepburn 2004). Galileo realizes that,\nbefore he can work out a science of the motion of matter, he must have\nsome way of showing that the nature of matter may be mathematically\ncharacterized. Both the mathematical nature of matter and the\nmathematical principles of motion he believes belong to the science of\n\u201cmechanics,\u201d which is the name he gives for this new way\nof philosophizing.\n\nSo it is in Day One that Galileo begins to discuss how to describe\nmathematically (or geometrically) the causes of the breaking of beams.\nBut this requires a way to reconcile mathematical description with the\nphysical constitution of material bodies. In this vein, Galileo\nrejects using finite atoms as a basis for physical discussion, since\nthey are not representable by continuously divisible mathematical\nmagnitudes. Instead, he treats matter as composed of infinitely many\nindivisible\u2014which is to say, mathematical\u2014points. This\nallows him to give mathematical accounts for various properties of\nmatter. Among these are the density of matter, its coherence in\nmaterial bodies, and the properties of the resisting media in which\nbodies move. The Second Day lays out the mathematical principles\nconcerning how bodies break. Galileo does all this by reducing the\nproblems of matter to problems of how a lever and a balance function,\nwhich renders them mathematically tractable via the law of the lever.\nHe had begun this back in 1590, though this time he believes he is\ngetting it right, showing mathematically how bits of matter solidify\nand stick together, and how they break into bits.\n\nThe First Day also contains Galileo\u2019s account of the\nacceleration of falling bodies, and the argument that they fall\nequally fast in a vacuum, whatever their weight. This discussion\ncontains the famous thought experiment refuting the Aristotelian\ntheory of fall, according to which the speed of a body\u2019s fall is\nproportional to its weight. In this \u201cshort and conclusive\u201d\nargument, Galileo supposes that two bodies, one heavier than the\nother, are suddenly conjoined in the midst of falling. On the one\nhand, if Aristotle is correct, the faster fall of the heavier body\nwill be retarded by the slower motion of the lighter body, so that the\nconjoined body will fall slower than the original heavy body. And yet,\nthe conjoined body is heavier than either original body, so it should\nalso fall faster. Hence, there is a contradiction in the Aristotelian\nposition (Gendler 1998; Palmieri 2005; Brown and Fehige 2019).\n\nGalileo\u2019s second new science, in Days Three and Four of the Two\nNew Sciences, deals with the mathematical description of local motion\nand the laws governing it. This is now the motion of all matter, not\njust sublunary stuff, and the treatment takes the categories of time\nand acceleration as basic. Here is where Galileo enunciates his law of\nfree fall, the parabolic path of projectiles, and other physical\n\u201cdiscoveries\u201d that would lay the foundation for modern\nphysics (Drake 1999, v. 2).\n\nIn the projected Fifth Day, Galileo would have treated the power of\nmoving matter to act by impact, which he calls the force of\npercussion. Ultimately, Galileo was unable to give mathematical\nprinciples of this kind of interaction, but this problem subsequently\nbecame an important locus of interest. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, probably\nfollowing Isaac Beeckman, would eventually convert the problem into\nthe task of finding equilibrium between the forces conserved by\ncolliding bodies. Descartes\u2019s own mathematical treatment was\nmistaken, but correct principles were given in 1668\u20139 by\nChristiaan Huygens, John Wallis, and Christopher Wren.\n\nThe sketch above provides the basis for understanding Galileo\u2019s\ncareer. He offered a new science of matter, a new physical\ncosmography, and a new science of local motion. In all these, he used\na mathematical mode of description based upon, though somewhat changed\nfrom, the proportional geometry of Book VI of Euclid\u2019s\nElements and of Archimedes (for details on the changes, see\nPalmieri 2001).\n\nIt is in this way that Galileo developed the categories of the\nmechanical new science, the science of matter and motion. His new\ncategories utilized some of the basic principles of traditional\nmechanics, to which he added the category of time and so emphasized\nacceleration. But throughout, he was working out the details about the\nnature of matter so that it could be understood as uniform and\nuniversal, and treated in a way that allowed for coherent discussion\nof the principles of motion. It was due to Galileo that a unified\nmatter became accepted and its nature became one of the problems for\nthe new science that followed. After him, matter really mattered.\n",
