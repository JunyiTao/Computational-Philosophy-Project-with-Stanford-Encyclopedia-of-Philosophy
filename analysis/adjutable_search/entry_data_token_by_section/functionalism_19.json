    "main_text": "Objections to Functionalism || Functionalism and the Norms of Reason\n5.4 Functionalism and the Norms of Reason\n\nYet another objection to functionalist theories of any sort is that\nthey do not capture the interrelations that we take to be definitive\nof beliefs, desires, and other intentional states. Whereas even\nanalytic functionalists hold that mental states \u2013 and also their\ncontents \u2013 are implicitly defined in terms of their (causal or\nprobabilistic) roles in producing behavior, these critics\nunderstand intentional states to be implicitly defined in terms of\ntheir roles in rationalizing, or making sense of,\nbehavior. This is a different enterprise, they claim, since\nrationalization, unlike causal explanation, requires showing how an\nindividual\u2019s beliefs, desires, and behavior conform, or at least\napproximate, to certain a priori norms or ideals of\ntheoretical and practical reasoning \u2013 prescriptions about which\nbeliefs and desires we should have, how we should\nreason, or what, given our beliefs and desires, we ought to\ndo. (See Davidson 1980c, Dennett 1978, and McDowell 1985 for classic\nexpressions of this view.) Thus the defining\n(\u201cconstitutive\u201d) normative or rational relations among\nintentional states expressed by these principles cannot be expected to\ncorrespond to causal and probabilistic relations among our internal\nstates, sensory stimulations and behavior, since they constitute a\nkind of explanation that has sources of evidence and standards for\ncorrectness that are different from those of empirical theories\n(Davidson 1980c). One can\u2019t, that is, extract facts from\nvalues.\n\nThus, although attributions of mental states can in some sense explain\nbehavior by permitting an observer to \u201cinterpret\u201d it as\nmaking sense, they should not be expected to denote entities that\nfigure in empirical generalizations, either common sense or\nscientific. (This is not to say, these theorists stress, that there\nare no causes, or empirical laws of, behavior. These, however, will be\nexpressible only in the vocabularies of the neurosciences, or other\nlower-level sciences, and not as relations among beliefs, desires and\nbehavior.)\n\nFunctionalists have replied to these worries in different ways. Many\njust deny the intuition behind the objection, and maintain that even\nthe strictest conceptual analyses of our intentional terms and\nconcepts purport to define them in terms of their bona-fide causal\nroles, and that any norms they reflect are explanatory rather than\nprescriptive. They argue, that is, that if these generalizations are\nidealizations, they are the sort of idealizations that occur in any\nscientific theory: just as Boyle\u2019s Law depicts the relations\nbetween the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas under certain\nideal experimental conditions, our a priori theory of the mind\nconsists of descriptions of what normal humans would do under\n(physically specifiable) ideal conditions, not prescriptions as to\nwhat they should, or are rationally required, to\ndo.\n\nOther functionalists agree that we may advert to various norms of\ninference and action in attributing beliefs and desires to others, but\ndeny that there is any in principle incompatibility between normative\nand empirical explanations. They argue that if there are causal\nrelations among beliefs, desires, and behavior that even approximately\nmirror the norms of rationality, then the attributions of intentional\nstates can be empirically confirmed (Fodor 1990; Rey 1997). In\naddition, many who hold this view suggest that the principles of\nrationality that intentional states must meet are quite minimal, and\ncomprise at most a weak set of constraints on the contours of our\ntheory of mind, such as that people can\u2019t, in general, hold\n(obviously) contradictory beliefs, or act against their (sincerely\navowed) strongest desires (Loar 1981). Still others suggest that the\nintuition that we attribute beliefs and desires to others according to\nrational norms is based on a fundamental mistake; these states are\nattributed not on the basis of whether they rationalize the behavior\nin question, but whether those subjects can be seen as using\nprinciples of inference and action sufficiently like our own \u2013\nbe they rational, like Modus Ponens, or irrational, like the\nGambler\u2019s Fallacy or the now familiar instances of\n\u201cpredictable irrationality\u201d documented in Kahneman, 2011.\n(See Stich 1981, and Levin 1988, for discussion of this question, and\nfor a more general debate about the compatibility of normative and\npsychological principles, see Rey, 2007, and Wedgwood, 2007. See also\nGl\u00fcer and Wikforss, 2009, 2013, and for further discussion, the\nentry on the\n normativity of meaning and content.)\n\nNonetheless, although many functionalists argue that the\nconsiderations discussed above show that there is no in principle bar\nto a functionalist theory that has empirical force, these worries\nabout the normativity of intentional ascription continue to fuel\nskepticism about functionalism (and, for that matter, any scientific\ntheory of the mind that uses intentional notions).\n\nIn addition to these general worries about functionalism, there are\nparticular questions that arise for functional characterizations of\nexperiential or phenomenal states. These questions will be discussed\nin the following section.\n",
