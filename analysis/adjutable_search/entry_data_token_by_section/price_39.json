Remarkable Anticipations\n\nWe end by illustrating a very impressive feature of Price\u2019s\ndiscussions: the degree to which he anticipates ideas that became a\nfocus of considerable attention later.\n\nIn Quine and Davidson\u2019s terminology, Price (1953a: ch. 7) is\nconcerned with the possibility of translation and interpretation,\nalthough he does not speak that way. Here, Price has latched onto the\nidea that accurate language-acquisition depends on and requires that\ncertain utterances dealing with observable matters must be true. He\ndoes not propose highly general principles, such as truth-maximisation\nfor belief as a constraint on interpretation\u2014indeed he is\nprobably against such a general claim\u2014but he appreciates the\ncrucial role of truth in relation to observation sentences. He also\nstresses the idea that language-acquisition centrally depends on\ninduction, an insight which any response to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nrule-following discussion should acknowledge. What is surprising,\nlooking back, is that these ideas in Price were not taken up, and his\nideas played no role in later discussion. The explanation for this, we\nbelieve, is that his book was unfortunately often ignored. \n\nElsewhere, Price (1929: 98) says that it is unfortunate to call\nstatements about oneself or one\u2019s mental states\n\u201csubjective\u201d as they are, in his words, \u201cas\n\u2018objective\u2019 as anything else, for they are realities\nexisting in the world whether anyone thinks about them or not\u201d\n(1929: 98). This anticipates reactions against Nagel (1974) and\nJackson\u2019s (1982: 130) attempts to capture our mental lives with\nwhat-it\u2019s-like-ness talk and the subjective/objective\ndistinction. He remarkably analyses \u201cknowing what it is like for\nsomething to be red\u201d (1969: 55) as a case of\nknowledge-by-acquaintance (see\n \u00a73.7\n above), with (1) first-handedness, and (2) familiarity, together\nyielding the capacity to recognise the colour when one encounters it\nelsewhere. He doesn\u2019t seem to think that such knowledge brings\nin anything non-objective.\n\nInterestingly, when applying his theory of recognition to recognising\nindividuals, Price reveals that he thinks of persisting individuals as\na succession of short-lived particulars, in effect what came to be\ncalled time-slices (1953a: 39).\n\nPrice\u2019s (1953a: 144ff) distinction between the sign and symbol\nsenses of meaning anticipates the same distinction in Grice (1957),\nfamously labelled natural versus non-natural meaning, by four years\nlooking at publication dates. However, Grice\u2019s paper was written\nearlier than when it appeared. Neither Price nor Grice mentions the\nother in their accounts and there is no way to decide who influenced\nwhom or whether they were independent.\n\nAccording to Langsam (1997: 57), Price (1932: 31) anticipates but\nquickly rejects the disjunctivist conception of experience later\ndefended by Hinton (1973), Snowdon (1981; 1990), and McDowell (1982).\nHe rejects it because \u201cthere is no qualitative difference\nbetween normal [veridical] sense-data as such and abnormal [e.g.,\nillusory] sense-data as such\u201d (1932: 31; for discussion: Crane\n2005: \u00a71.2).\n",
