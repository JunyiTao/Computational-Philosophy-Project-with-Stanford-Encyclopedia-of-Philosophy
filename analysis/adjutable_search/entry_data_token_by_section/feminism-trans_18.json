Scheman rejects the options of either claiming a\nplace at the center of normalized forms of life (from which one has\ninitially been excluded), or refusing to engage the dominant forms of\nidentity at all (by accepting one's \u201cmarginal\u201d\nstatus). Instead, Scheman aims to contest the normative center by\ncentralizing those who have been marginalized (126\u20137). With this in\nmind, she begins with the assumption that marginalized lives \u201care\nlived, and hence livable\u201d (132).\n\nScheman draws on her own lack of clarity about Jewish identity, as a\nsecular Jew, in order to help trouble the unproblematic status of her\nown gender. She sees a Jewish people conceptually required by\nChristianormativity, and yet rendered unintelligible by its\nrepresentation of all religions as entirely conversion-based (1997,\n128). Under such conditions, it becomes hard to explain what it is to\nidentify as a secular Jew. Likewise, she sees transsexuality as\ninvolving a required incoherence. Since heteronormativity requires a\n\u201cnatural\u201d binary of women and men, transsexuals are\nparadoxically defined by an insistence of having always been the other\nsex all along and thereby required to deny their own histories (as\nStone argues) (138\u20139). In this respect, Scheman notes,\nChristianormativity and heteronormativity are contrasting: The former\nrepresents all religions as driven by choice and conversion, the latter\nrepresents all gender as naturally determined at birth (142).\n\nBoth \u201cJewishness\u201d and \u201cwomanhood\u201d for Scheman,\ncan be understood as family-resemblance concepts (1997, 144). However\nthose who have been assigned to the category Jew on the basis\nof ancestry or to a gender on the basis of birth form the basis of such\nconcepts without which the concepts would not exist at all (144). She\nintroduces the expression \u201cperinatally pinked\u201d to describe\nthose individuals who have experienced oppression as female from birth\nand recommends it as a way to understand the need for\n\u201cwomyn-born-womyn\u201d space which she sees as intended for\nhealing the damage inflicted through natal assignment as a female in a\nmisogynist society (141\u20132).\n\nYet just as individuals may convert to Judaism and become a Jew,\nScheman suggests, MTFs may be understood to \u201cconvert\u201d to\nwomanhood. In both cases, such individuals are no less real than those\nwho have been assigned the categories at birth (144). While she notes\nseveral disanalogies (e.g., in the case of transsexuality one does not\nsimply choose, as one might convert to a religion), she also\nsuggests that by viewing sex/gender as more analogous to Jewishness in\nthis respect, some of its oppressiveness might be undermined (145). The\nnotion of joining a collectivity is important, for Scheman, because it\nstresses the importance of shared bonds, values, and commitments. In\nthe end, this is what is most important, she argues: \u201cThe issue,\nthen, is not who is or is not really whatever but who can be counted on\nwhen they come for any one of us: The solid ground is not identity but\nloyalty and solidarity\u201d (153).\n",
