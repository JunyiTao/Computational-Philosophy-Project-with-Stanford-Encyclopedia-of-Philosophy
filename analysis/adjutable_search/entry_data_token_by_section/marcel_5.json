Problem and Mystery\n\nThe notion that we live in a broken world is used\u2014along with the\nperson who is characteristic of the broken world, the functionalized\nperson\u2014to segue into one of Marcel\u2019s central thematic\ndistinctions: the distinction between problem and mystery. He states\nthat the broken world is one that is \u201con the one hand, riddled\nwith problems and, on the other, determined to allow no room for\nmystery\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 12). The denial of the mysterious is\nsymptomatic of the modern broken world and is tied to its technical\ncharacter, which only acknowledges that which technique can address:\nthe problematic. The distinction between problem and mystery is one\nthat hinges, like much of Marcel\u2019s thought, on the notion of\nparticipation.\n\nA problem is something which I meet, which I find completely before\nme, but which I can therefore lay siege to and reduce. But a mystery\nis something in which I am myself involved, and it can therefore only\nbe thought of as a sphere where the distinction between what is in me\nand what is before me loses its meaning and initial validity. (Marcel\n1949, p. 117)\n\n\nA problem is a question in which I am not involved, in which the\nidentity of the person asking the question is not an issue. In the\nrealm of the problematic, it makes no difference who is asking the\nquestion because all of the relevant information is\n\u201cbefore\u201d the questioner. As such, a problem is something\nthat bars my way, placing an obstacle in front of me that must be\novercome. In turn, the overcoming of a problem inevitably involves\nsome technique, a technique that could be, and often is, employed by\nany other person confronting the same problem. Thus the identity of\nthe questioner can be changed without altering the problem itself.\nThis is why the modern broken world only sees the problematic: the\n\u2018problematic\u2019 is that which can be addressed and solved\nwith a technique, e.g., changing a flat tire on an automobile or\ndownloading security software to fix a virus on one\u2019s\ncomputer.\n\nWhen I am dealing with a problem, I am trying to discover a solution\nthat can become common property, that consequently can, at least in\ntheory, be rediscovered by anybody at all. But\u2026this idea of a\nvalidity for \u201canybody at all\u201d or of a thinking in general\nhas less and less application the more deeply one penetrates into the\ninner courts of philosophy\u2026 (Marcel 1951a, p. 213)\n\n\nMarcel often describes a mystery as a \u201cproblem that encroaches\non its own data\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 19). Such a\n\u201cproblem\u201d is, in fact, meta-problematic; it is a question\nin which the identity of the questioner becomes an issue\nitself\u2014where, in fact, the questioner is involved in the\nquestion he or she is asking. On the level of the mysterious, the\nidentity of the questioner is tied to the question and, therefore, the\nquestioner is not interchangeable. To change the questioner would be\nto alter the question. It makes every difference who is asking the\nquestion when confronting a mystery. Here, on the level of the\nmysterious, the distinctions \u201cin-me\u201d and\n\u201cbefore-me\u201d break down. Marcel insists that mysteries can\nbe found in the question of Being (e.g., my ontological\nexigence), the union of the body and soul, the\n\u201cproblem\u201d of evil and\u2014perhaps the archetypal\nexamples of mystery\u2014freedom and love. For example, I cannot\nquestion Being as if my being is not at issue in the questioning. The\nquestion of being and the question of who I am (my being) cannot be\naddressed separately. These two questions are somehow incoherent if\napproached as problems; however, taken together, their mysterious\ncharacter is revealed and they cancel themselves out qua\nproblems.\n\nAnother example is the \u201cproblem of evil\u201d (Marcel, 1995,\npp. 19-20). Marcel distinguishes between what philosophers refer to as\nthe existential problem of evil (how a particular individual responds\nto an experience of evil in his or her own life), and the\nphilosophical problem of evil (how a philosopher might think about the\n\u201cproblem\u201d of evil\u2014how evil is to be reconciled with\nthe existence of an all-good and all-powerful God, for instance). He\nnotes that the existential problem cannot be fully discussed at the\nphilosophical level precisely because the experience of the questioner\nis left out. He notes that, \u201cEvil which is only stated or\nobserved is no longer evil which is suffered: in fact, it ceases to be\nevil. In reality, I can only grasp it as evil in the measure in which\nit touches me\u2014that is to say, in the measure in which I\nam involved\u2026being \u2018involved\u2019 is the\nfundamental fact\u201d (Marcel, 1995, p. 19). In addition, the\nphilosopher seeks solutions to the problem of evil that can be\npresented to everyone in a logically objective manner, so almost by\ndefinition these solutions cannot fully address the existential\nquestion. Marcel also proposes that sometimes philosophers can fall\ninto the error of thinking that the philosophical problem should be\nthe main way to approach the experience of evil, and as a result can\nfail to appreciate the necessity of helping people deal with the\nexistential problem. In general, this failure is something we can\nobserve in many different areas of primary reflection, including\nacademic disciplines, which sometimes lose touch with the experiences\nthat gave rise to the problems the disciplines are supposed to be\naddressing.\n\nUnlike problems, mysteries are not solved with techniques and\ntherefore cannot be answered the same way by different\npersons\u2014one technique, one solution, will not apply in the\ndifferent cases presented by different persons. Indeed, it is\nquestionable if mysteries are open to \u201csolutions\u201d at all.\nNevertheless, it would be incorrect to call the mysterious a gap in\nour knowledge in the same way that a problem is. \u201cThe mysterious\nis not the unknowable, the unknowable is only the limiting case of the\nproblematic\u201d (Marcel 1949, p. 118).\n\nAlthough a mystery may be insoluble, it is not senseless; and while\nits inexpressibility makes it difficult to fully describe in\ncommunicable knowledge, it can still be spoken of in a suggestive way\n(Marcel 1964, xxv). Marcel notes in a journal entry dated December\n18th, 1932 that:\n\nThe metaproblematic is a participation on which my reality as a\nsubject is built\u2026 and reflection will show that such a\nparticipation, if it is genuine, cannot be a solution. If it\nwere it would cease to be a participation in a transcendent reality,\nand would become, instead, an interpolation into transcendent\nreality, and would be degraded in the process\u2026 (Marcel 1949, p.\n114)\n\n\nReferring back to the idea of a broken world, the technical and the\nproblematic are questions that are addressed with only\n\u201cpart\u201d of a person. The full person is not engaged in the\ntechnical because a person\u2019s self, her identity, is not at\nissue. \u201cAt the root of having [and problems, and technics] there\nlies a certain specialization of specification of the self, and this\nis connected with [a] partial alienation of the self\u2026\u201d\n(Marcel 1949, p. 172). Problems are addressed impersonally, in a\ndetached manner, while mysteries demand participation, involvement.\nAlthough some problems can be reflected on in such a way that they\nbecome mysterious, all mysteries can be reflected on in such a way\nthat the mystery is degraded and becomes merely problematic.\n",
