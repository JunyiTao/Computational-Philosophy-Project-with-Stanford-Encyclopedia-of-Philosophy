    "main_text": "The Late Period || Peter of Ailly\n4.3 Peter of Ailly\n\nAs already mentioned\n (Section 3.7\n above), in 1372 the Frenchman Peter of Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco)\nwrote an Insolubilia that preserves all we know of Gregory of\nRimini\u2019s theory. Peter\u2019s theory looks much like\nGregory\u2019s. Nevertheless, he did not accept Gregory\u2019s view\nentirely. Whereas for Gregory, an insoluble in spoken or written\nlanguage corresponds to or expresses a conjunction of two\npropositions in mental language, for Peter it corresponds to or\nexpresses two distinct mental propositions, not their\nconjunction. The two distinct mental propositions are the same two\nthat Gregory had conjoined.\n\nIn medieval semantics, propositions that correspond to two distinct\nmental propositions are ambiguous or equivocal. (Indeed, that is the\nmedieval account of equivocation.) Thus, for Peter,\ninsolubles in spoken or written language are strictly equivocal and do\nnot have a single signification. In one sense (answering to the first\nof Gregory\u2019s conjuncts), they are true; in another sense\n(answering to Gregory\u2019s second conjunct), they are false. By\ncontrast, for Gregory, insolubles are just false, not ambiguous at\nall; they correspond to a single false conjunction, one\nconjunct of which is true and the other false.\n\nPeter\u2019s theory has the phenomenological advantage that it\naccounts for the psychological \u201cflip-flop\u201d sense we have\nwhen thinking about insolubles. When we look at them one way they seem\ntrue; when we look at them another way, they seem false. No other\nmedieval theory seems to account for this psychological fact. For\nfurther discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2008a: \u00a73.8.\n",
