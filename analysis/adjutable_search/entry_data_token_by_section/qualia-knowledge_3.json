    "main_text": "Some Clarifications || Physical and Non-physical\n3.2 Physical and Non-physical\n\nThe knowledge argument is often cited as one of those anti-physicalist\nqualia-based arguments that are supposed to justify property dualism.\nThe above formulation, however, does not explicitly mention\nnon-physical properties but only non-physical facts. But the relation\nbetween the two claims is obvious. Friends of the knowledge argument\nwill say that the facts at issue are non-physical because\nthey involve the exemplification of non-physical properties (e.g. of\nthe property of having an experience with quality Q).\n\nIn the assumption that Mary has all physical knowledge (first version)\nor knows all the physical facts (second version)\n\u201cphysical\u201d is meant in a very broad sense that includes\nknowledge about (or facts concerning) the functioning of the receptors\nand neurons involved in color vision (biological and physiological\nknowledge/facts) as well as knowledge about (or facts concerning) the\nwhole network of causal relations between processes underlying color\nvision, external stimuli and behavior (functional knowledge/\nfunctional facts). \u201cPhysical\u201d knowledge in the broad sense\nat issue even includes psychological knowledge (e.g. knowledge about\nthe result of psychophysical experiments) in so far as they can be\nformulated without use of phenomenal terminology. One might try to\nexplicate \u201cphysical knowledge\u201d in the sense at issue in\nroughly the following way: physical knowledge includes all knowledge\nthat is expressible in a terminology that does not contain irreducibly\nmental terms. It would be natural to define physical facts as those\nfacts that can be expressed in this way. But note that this definition\nof \u2018physical facts\u2019 begs the question against an objection\nthat has been raised against the knowledge argument (see\n Section 4.2\n below). It is certainly not easy to formulate a precise, adequate and\nnon question-begging account of \u201cphysical knowledge\u201d and\n\u201cphysical facts\u201d suited for the discussion of the\nknowledge argument. It is, however, quite common to assume that our\nintuitive understanding of \u201cphysical knowledge\u201d in the\nbroad sense at issue is clear enough for the purposes of the debate,\nthough some argue that talk of \u201cphysical facts\u201d needs\nclarification (see Alter 1998).\n",
