    "main_text": "Two views about mathematics: nominalism and platonism\n1. Two views about mathematics: nominalism and platonism\nIn ontological discussions about mathematics, two views are\nprominent. According to platonism, mathematical objects (as well as\nmathematical relations and structures) exist and are abstract; that\nis, they are not located in space and time and have no causal\nconnection with us. Although this characterization of abstract\nobjects is purely negative\u2014indicating what such\nobjects are not\u2014in the context of mathematics it\ncaptures the crucial features the objects in questions are supposed to\nhave. According to nominalism, mathematical objects (including,\nhenceforth, mathematical relations and structures) do not exist, or at\nleast they need not be taken to exist for us to make sense of\nmathematics. So, it is the nominalist's burden to show how to\ninterpret mathematics without the commitment to the existence of\nmathematical objects. This is, in fact, a key feature of nominalism:\nthose who defend the view need to show that it is possible to yield at\nleast as much explanatory work as the platonist obtains, but invoking\na meager ontology. To achieve that, nominalists in the philosophy of\nmathematics forge interconnections with metaphysics (whether\nmathematical objects do exist), epistemology (what kind of knowledge\nof these entities we have), and philosophy of science (how to make\nsense of the successful application of mathematics in science without\nbeing committed to the existence of mathematical entities). These\ninterconnections are one of the sources of the variety of nominalist\nviews.\nDespite the substantial differences between nominalism and\nplatonism, they have at least one feature in common: both come in many\nforms. There are various versions of platonism in the philosophy of\nmathematics: standard (or object-based) platonism (G\u00f6del 1944,\n1947; Quine 1960), structuralism (Resnik 1997; Shapiro 1997), and\nfull-blooded platonism (Balaguer 1998), among other views. Similarly,\nthere are also several versions of nominalism: fictionalism (Field\n1980, 1989), modal structuralism (Hellman 1989, 1996),\nconstructibilism (Chihara 1990), the weaseling-away view (Melia 1995,\n2000), figuralism (Yablo 2001), deflationary nominalism (Azzouni\n2004), agnostic nominalism (Bueno 2008, 2009), and pretense views\n(Leng 2010), among others. Similarly to their platonist counterparts,\nthe various nominalist proposals have different motivations, and face\ntheir own difficulties. These will be explored in turn. (A critical\nsurvey of various nominalization strategies in mathematics can be\nfound in Burgess and Rosen (1997). The authors address in detail both\nthe technical and philosophical issues raised by nominalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics.)\nDiscussions about nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics in\nthe 20th century started roughly with the work that\nW. V. Quine and Nelson Goodman developed toward constructive\nnominalism (Goodman and Quine 1947). But, as Quine later pointed out,\nin the end it was indispensable to quantify over classes (Quine\n1960). As will become clear below, responses to this indispensability\nargument have generated a significant amount of work for\nnominalists. And it is the focus on the indispensability argument that\nlargely distinguishes more recent nominalist views in the philosophy\nof mathematics, which I will focus on, from the nominalism developed\nin the early part of the 20th century by the Polish school\nof logic (Simons 2010).\nMathematical nominalism is a form of anti-realism about abstract\nobjects. This is an independent issue from the traditional problem of\nnominalism about universals. A universal, according to a widespread\nuse, is something that can be instantiated by different\nentities. Since abstract objects are neither spatial nor temporal,\nthey cannot be instantiated. Thus, mathematical nominalism and\nnominalism about universals are independent from one another (see the\nentry on nominalism in\nmetaphysics). It could be argued that certain sets encapsulate the\ninstantiation model, since a set of concrete objects can be\ninstantiated by such objects. But since the same set cannot\nbe so instantiated, given that sets are individuated by their members\nand as long as their members are different the resulting sets are not\nthe same, it is not clear that even these sets are instantiated. I\nwill focus here on mathematical nominalism.\n",
