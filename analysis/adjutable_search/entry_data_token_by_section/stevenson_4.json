    "main_text": "Language and Psychology\n3. Language and Psychology\n\nFor Stevenson, language is an instrument or tool for serving certain\npurposes; ethical language is thus suited especially for the central\npurposes of ethics. Since the central purposes of ethics are to\nresolve or coordinate attitudes, an analysis of ethical language must\nreveal how ethical language serves these dynamic purposes. It does so,\naccording to Stevenson, by having emotive meaning in\naddition to descriptive meaning, where meaning is to be cashed out in\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d or dispositional terms.\n",
