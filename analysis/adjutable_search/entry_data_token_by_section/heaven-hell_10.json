    "main_text": "The Universalist Rejection of Everlasting Separation || Universalism and Human Freedom\n4.2 Universalism and Human Freedom\n\nA widely held assumption among free\u2013will theists is that no\nguarantee of universal reconciliation is even possible apart from\nGod\u2019s willingness to interfere with human freedom in those cases\nwhere someone persists in rejecting God and his grace. Indeed,\nJonathan Kvanvig goes so far as to describe universalism as a\n\u201cview, according to which God finally decides that if one has\nnot freely chosen Heaven, there will come a time when one will be\nbrought to Heaven against one\u2019s will. One will experience, in\nthis sense, coercive redemption at some point\u201d (Kvanvig 2011,\n14). But in fact, no universalist\u2014not even a theological\ndeterminist\u2014holds that God sometimes coerces people into heaven\nagainst their will. For although many Christian universalists\nbelieve that God provided Saul of Tarsus with certain revelatory\nexperiences that changed his mind in the end and therefore\nchanged his will as well, this is a far cry from claiming that he was\ncoerced against his will. Kvanvig\u2019s own understanding of\nlibertarian freedom, moreover, already establishes the logical\npossibility that God can bring about a universal reconciliation\nwithout in any way interfering with human freedom. \n\nBut in addition to defending the bare logical possibility of such a\nuniversal reconciliation on libertarian grounds, Eric Reitan has set\nforth an intriguing argument, which he calls \u201cthe Argument from\nInfinite Opportunity,\u201d for the conclusion that God can\neffectively guarantee the salvation of all sinners without ever\ninterfering with anyone\u2019s libertarian freedom (see Kronen and\nReitan 2011, Ch. 8). The basic idea here is that a sinner could have,\nif necessary, infinitely many opportunities over an unending stretch\nof time to repent and to submit to God freely. So consider this.\nAlthough it is logically possible, given the normal philosophical view\nof the matter, that a fair coin would never land heads up, not even\nonce in a trillion tosses, such an eventuality is so incredibly\nimprobable and so close to an impossibility that no one need fear it\nactually happening. Similarly, in working with some sinner S\n(shattering S\u2019s illusions and correcting S\u2019s ignorance),\nGod could presumably bring S to a point, just short of actually\ndetermining S\u2019s choice, where S would see the choice between\nhorror and bliss with such clarity that the probability of S repenting\nand submitting to God would be extremely high. Or, if you prefer, drop\nthe probability to .5. Over an indefinitely long period of time, S\nwould still have an indefinitely large number of opportunities to\nrepent; and so, according to Reitan, the assumption that sinners\nretain their libertarian freedom together with the Christian doctrine\nof the preservation of the saints yields the following result. We can\nbe just as confident that God will eventually win over all sinners\n(and do so without causally determining their choices), as we can be\nthat a fair coin will land heads up at least once in a trillion\ntosses.\n\nA possible reply to Reitan\u2019s argument, as just briefly\nsummarized, is that our free choices can sometimes create a hardened\ncharacter, which in turn places constraints on future free choices.\nBut either the hardened character of those in hell removes forever the\npsychological possibility of their choosing to repent, or it does not.\nIf it does remove that psychological possibility, then they do not\ncontinue rejecting God freely in the sense that the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP) requires; and if it does not remove\nthat psychological possibility, then Reitan\u2019s argument remains\npertinent. Beyond that, the most critical issue at this point concerns\nthe relationship between free choice, on the one hand, and character\nformation, on the other. Our moral experience does seem to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes produce bad\nhabits and a bad moral character, but it also seems to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes bring one closer\nto a dramatic conversion of some kind. So why not suppose that a\npattern of bad choices might be even more useful to God than a pattern\nof good choices would be in teaching the hard lessons we sometimes\nneed to learn and in thus rendering a dramatic conversion increasingly\nmore probable over the long run? Are not the destructive consequences\nthat alcoholism can have in the lives of some people the very thing\nthat sometimes motivates them to seek help and even to give up alcohol\n altogether?[10]\n For more on the issue of free will and character formation, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Sennett 1999, Murray 1999, the rejoinder to\nMurray in Kronen and Reitan 2011 (170\u2013177), the discussion of\ncharacter formation in Talbott 2010 (9\u201313), and section 5.1\nbelow.\n",
