    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nWe use language to talk about the world. Much of what we say about the\nworld appears to be meaningful; some of it, presumably, is even true.\nFor instance, I seem to be saying something true when, in the\nappropriate sort of setting, I assertively utter:\n\nBarack Obama is a Democrat.\n\n\nHow do we manage to do such things? How, for instance, do I manage to\ntalk about Barack Obama and thereby say meaningful and true things\nabout him? In a word: how do I refer to Barack Obama by means\nof the name \u2018Barack Obama\u2019? Metaphorically, we seem to be\ncapable of using language to talk about the world because some of our\nwords are themselves capable of \u2018hooking onto\u2019 things in\nthe world, things like Barack Obama. Proper names\u2014that is,\nexpressions like \u2018Barack Obama\u2019 and \u2018David\nCameron\u2019\u2014are widely regarded as paradigmatic referring\nexpressions. Although it may seem implausible to suppose that\nall words refer, that all words somehow \u2018hook\nonto\u2019 bits of reality, certain types of words are arguably of\nthe referring sort. These include: proper names, pronouns, indexicals,\ndemonstratives, plurals, natural kind terms, and various other sorts\nof property terms. Definite descriptions are another, though highly\ncontroversial, candidate. Here, we\u2019ll focus on just a subset of \nthese\u2014namely, what are often called \u2018singular\u2019\nreferential terms. These are terms that, supposing they refer, refer\nto particular objects and individuals as opposed to groups or\nproperties. Since singular referential terms have been subjected to\nintensive philosophical scrutiny over the past hundred years, this \nwill still leave us with plenty to discuss.\n\nThis article will focus on five central, related questions regarding\nreference: (i) How does the reference relation that obtains between\ntoken uses of terms and objects relate to the act of reference, the\nthing that speakers do with these terms? In other words, do\nterms refer to what they do in virtue of our using them to do so, or\ndo we use them to refer in virtue of their already doing so? \n(ii) What are the meanings of referential terms? Are they\njust referents, or rather something more? (iii) What is the\nmechanism of reference? In other words, in virtue of what\ndoes a token referential term attach to a particular\nobject/individual? (iv) Is there a single mechanism of reference\ncommon to all referring terms, or do different sorts of terms hook\nonto their referents in virtue of different sorts of things? And (v)\nto what extent, if at all, can reference depend on relatively private\nfeatures of the speaker, such as her intentions or other mental\nstates?\n\nOur goal here will be to map out how answers to these various\nquestions naturally cluster together into several distinct outlooks on\nreference, outlooks which drive a great deal of theorizing about\nparticular referential terms and phrases. To get there, we\u2019ll start in\nSection 2 by looking at two of the main approaches to proper names.\nThen, in Section 3, we\u2019ll turn to indexicals and demonstratives, which\nput pressure on the thought that these two approaches represent an\nexhaustive set of options. Section 4 will focus on definite\ndescriptions, which will serve to bring to the fore the question of\nhow the reference relation itself relates to the act of \nreference\u2014a question which serves to highlight some potential\ndeficiencies in earlier models of linguistic reference. Section 5 will\nstep back to outline the main clusters of positions we will have\ndeveloped by that point. Finally, Section 6 wraps up by looking at the\nreasons that have been offered for doubting whether there is really\nany such thing as the reference relation at all.\n\nFor the sake of both clarity and brevity, this entry will refrain from\nventuring too deeply into the detailed debates regarding the meaning,\nsyntactic form, or function of the various terms we\u2019ll be looking at.\nRather, we\u2019ll focus instead on what, if anything, can be said about\nthe nature of linguistic reference in general. For a more detailed look\nat the idiosyncrasies of these various terms, please see the entries\non\n names,\n descriptions, and\n indexicals.\n See also the related entry on\n natural kinds,\n",
