    "main_text": "Knowledge || Ideal Type\n5.2 Ideal Type\n\nThe methodology of \u201cideal type\u201d (Idealtypus) is\nanother testimony to such a broadly ethical intention of Weber.\nAccording to Weber\u2019s definition, \u201can ideal type is formed\nby the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of\nview\u201d according to which \u201cconcrete individual\nphenomena \u2026 are arranged into a unified analytical\nconstruct\u201d (Gedankenbild); in its purely fictional\nnature, it is a methodological \u201cutopia [that] cannot be found\nempirically anywhere in reality\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 90]. Keenly\naware of its fictional nature, the ideal type never seeks to claim its\nvalidity in terms of a reproduction of or a correspondence with\nreality. Its validity can be ascertained only in terms of adequacy,\nwhich is too conveniently ignored by the proponents of positivism.\nThis does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can\nbe gained by \u201cweighing the various evaluations against one\nanother and making a \u2018statesman-like\u2019 compromise among\nthem\u201d [Weber 1917/1949, 10], which is often proposed as a\nsolution by those sharing Weber\u2019s kind of methodological\nperspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls\n\u201csyncretism,\u201d is not only impossible but also unethical,\nfor it avoids \u201cthe practical duty to stand up for our own\nideals\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 58].\n\nAccording to Weber, a clear value commitment, no matter how\nsubjective, is both unavoidable and necessary. It is\nunavoidable, for otherwise no meaningful knowledge can be\nattained. Further, it is necessary, for otherwise the value\nposition of a researcher would not be foregrounded clearly and\nadmitted as such \u2013 not only to the readers of the research\noutcome but also to the very researcher him/herself. In other words,\nWeber\u2019s emphasis on \u201cone-sidedness\u201d\n(Einseitigkeit) not only affirms the subjective nature of\nscientific knowledge but also demands that the researcher be\nself-consciously subjective. The ideal type is devised for\nthis purpose, for \u201conly as an ideal type\u201d can subjective\nvalue \u2013 \u201cthat unfortunate child of misery of our\nscience\u201d \u2013 \u201cbe given an unambiguous meaning\u201d\n[Ibid., 107]. Along with value-freedom, then, what the ideal\ntype methodology entails in ethical terms is, on the one hand, a\ndaring confrontation with the tragically subjective foundation of our\nhistorical and social scientific knowledge and, on the other, a public\nconfession of one\u2019s own subjective value. Weber\u2019s\nmethodology in the end amounts to a call for the heroic\ncharacter-virtue of clear-sightedness and intellectual integrity that\ntogether constitute a genuine person of science \u2013 a scientist\nwith a sense of vocation who has a passionate commitment to\none\u2019s own specialized research, yet is utterly \u201cfree of\nillusions\u201d [L\u00f6with 1982, 38].\n",
