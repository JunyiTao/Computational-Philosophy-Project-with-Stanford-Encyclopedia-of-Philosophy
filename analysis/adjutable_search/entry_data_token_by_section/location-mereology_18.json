If one slightly alters the passage (quoted\nin\n Section 4.4)\n in which McDaniel presents his recombination argument for\ninterpenetration (2007a: 241), one gets the following, parallel\nargument for multilocation:\n\n\nThe actual state of affairs in which an object x is exactly\nlocated at a particular region r is distinct from the merely\npossible state of affairs in which object x is exactly located\nat some other, disjoint region r*. From the fact that x\nis exactly located at r, we can infer nothing about what, if\nanything, is exactly located at r*. Both states of affairs are\ncontingent: they possibly obtain and possibly fail to obtain. If any\nrecombination of contingent states of affairs yields a genuine\npossibility, then there are possible worlds at which x is\nexactly located both at r and at r* and hence is\nmultilocated.\n\n\nThis argument appears to have the same virtues and vices as McDaniel's\noriginal argument for interpenetration.\n\n(Some recombination arguments for interpenetration and extended\nsimples cannot be adapted to yield an argument for multilocation. See\nSection 3.2 of the supplemetary document\n Additional Arguments.)\n",
