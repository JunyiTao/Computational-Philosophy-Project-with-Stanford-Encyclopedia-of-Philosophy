Moral motivation 2: the righteousness of morality\n\nIn the Essays on the Law of Nature, Locke argues that there\nare two different kinds of obedience to the law of a superior\nauthority, and that these are founded upon two distinct kinds of\nobligation. The example is as follows:\n\nAnyone would easily \u2026 perceive that there was one ground of his\nobedience when as a captive he was constrained to the service of a\npirate, and that there was another ground when as a subject he was\ngiving obedience to a ruler; he would judge in one way about\ndisregarding allegiance to a king, in another about wittingly\ntransgressing the orders of a pirate or robber. (Locke 1663\u201364,\n118)\n\n\nAt this point, Locke might be understood to be distinguishing laws\nbacked by a rightful authority and laws that are not, in which the\npoint is simply that there is no obligation to the pirate, since his\nare not strictly laws at all on Locke\u2019s definition of the term.\nHowever, Locke continues this passage as follows:\n\nin the latter case [subject to a pirate or robber], with the approval\nof conscience, he rightly had regard only for his well-being, but in\nthe former [subject to a king], though conscience condemned him, he\nwould violate the right of another. (Locke 1663\u201364, 118)\n\n\nLocke identifies two distinct grounds of obedience. Recognizing that\none\u2019s obligation to the king arises from his rightful authority\nprovides a grounds for obedience that is absent in the case of obeying\nthe pirate. My reasons for obeying the pirate are hedonistic, but my\nreasons for obeying the king involve my recognition of his rightful\nauthority. Further on in the same Essay, Locke explains\nthat\n\nWe should not obey a king just out of fear, because, being more\npowerful he can constrain (this in fact would be to establish firmly\nthe authority of tyrants, robbers, and pirates), but for conscience\u2019\nsake, because a king has command over us by right; that is to say,\nbecause the law of nature decrees that princes and a lawmaker, or a\nsuperior by whatever name you call him, should be obeyed. (Locke\n1663\u201364, 120)\n\n\nThus, sanctions are not the sole motivating factor for Locke. The\ncontrast Locke draws here is an important but commonly\nunderappreciated one; that is, acting for \u201cconscience\u2019\nsake\u201d versus acting \u2018out of fear\u2019 as two\nquite distinct grounds for obedience.\n\nThe question that remains is how Locke\u2019s notion of acting \u2018for\nconscience\u2019 sake\u2019 can be made sense of within the context of\nLocke\u2019s general hedonistic account of motivation. It might sound as\nthough we are working with the kind of purely rational motivating\nfactor that Locke\u2019s hedonistic theory clearly rejects; for Locke\nall human action is motivated by considerations of pleasure\nand pain.\n\nRecall that for Locke rewards and punishments are specific pleasures\nand pains. Acting for conscience\u2019 sake will necessarily involve\nconsiderations of pleasure and pain, but of a kind quite distinct from\nsanctions. For Locke, there is a kind of pleasure that attends\nfulfilling one\u2019s moral duty that is quite distinct from considerations\nof reward and punishment. In an essay, written in 1692, entitled\nEthica A (the first of two essays, the other entitled\nEthica B), Locke appeals to a kind of pleasure that attends\nthe fulfilment of one\u2019s moral duty:\n\nWhoever spared a meal to save the life of a starving man, much more a\nfriend\u2026but had more and much more lasting pleasure in it than\nhe that eat it. The other\u2019s pleasure died as he eat and ended with his\nmeal. But to him that gave it him \u2018tis a feast as often as he\nreflects on it\u2019. (Locke 1692, 319)\n\n\nThe pleasure here is of a special kind. It is not the same as the\npleasure we get from satisfying our hunger, nor is it the pleasure\nthat comes with pleasing an authority or earning a reward. In fact,\nLocke explicitly distinguishes it from the pleasure expected in the\nafterlife. Fulfilling one\u2019s duty, for Locke, carries its own kind of\npleasurable motive\u2014it makes us happy. As Locke writes, further\non in Ethica A, \u201cHappiness\u2026is annexed to our\nloving others and to doing our duty, to acts of love and\ncharity\u201d (Locke 1692, 319). Acting according to moral duty,\nthen, is motivated by feelings of pleasure that attend such acts.\n\nWhy, then, does Locke so frequently emphasize the legalistic angle of\nmorality, which depends so heavily on the motivational force of reward\nand punishment? In Locke\u2019s view, many people fail to acknowledge, or\nbe motivated by, the pleasure inherent to the fulfilment of one\u2019s\nmoral duty, and for these people (which, it turns out, is most of us),\nGod has provided extra incentive\u2014the rewards and punishments God\nattaches to our actions are a matter of God\u2019s jurisdiction, quite\napart from the pleasures of acting dutifully, and in accordance with\nrighteous moral dictates. As Locke explains, God\n\nbrings in a necessity of another life\u2026and so enforces morality\nthe stronger, laying a necessity on God\u2019s justice by his rewards and\npunishments, to make the good the gainers, the wicked losers. (Locke\n1692, 319)\n\n\nSanctions, therefore, serve to enforce morality \u2018the\nstronger\u2019 but are quite clearly secondary to the intrinsic\npleasures motivating dutiful action. So, conscience does not motivate\nin and of itself, nor does the rational apprehension of one\u2019s moral\nduty, but Locke identifies a species of pleasure distinct from divine\nsanctions that makes his notion of acting for conscience\u2019 sake\nperfectly consistent with his hedonism: to act for conscience\u2019\nsake is to be motivated by, and take pleasure in, acting in accordance\nwith one\u2019s moral duty.\n",
