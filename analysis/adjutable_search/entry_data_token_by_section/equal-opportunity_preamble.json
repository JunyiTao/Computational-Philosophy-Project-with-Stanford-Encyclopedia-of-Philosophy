Such is the\nvariety of ideas to which the term Equality of Opportunity has been\nused to refer, some have been tempted to question whether there is a\ncoherent single core concept at stake at all (Westen 1985) or have\ncalled for it to be abandoned altogether (Radcliffe Richards 1997).\nFor this reason, a substantial amount of the philosophical work that\nexplicitly reflects on the notion of Equality of Opportunity involves\nunpacking and distinguishing the range of different ideas that fly\nunder that banner (for example, Arneson 2018; Green 1989; Riva 2015).\nIf there is a broad unifying theme between conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity, it is the notion of a justified hierarchy or inequality\nwhich classifies some factors as being inappropriate determinants of\npersons\u2019 success. Equality of Opportunity is contested partly\nbecause people differ over which factors do or do not qualify as\nobstructions on persons\u2019 opportunities to succeed in the\nrelevant sense. Different conceptions of Equality of Opportunity can\nbe roughly ordered along a spectrum\u2014from formal to\nsubstantive\u2014according to the range of factors that are deemed\nobstructions on relevant opportunities.\n",
