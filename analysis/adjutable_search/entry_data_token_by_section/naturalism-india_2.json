    "main_text": "Indian Concepts of Nature || Atomism : Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\n2.1 Atomism : Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\n\nLike Greek atomism, Indian atomism was speculative and local. The\nroots of Indian atomism can be traced back to the Upani\u1e63adic\ndoctrine of five elements (pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101bh\u016btas), viz.,\nearth, water, fire, air, and vyom or \u0101k\u0101\u015ba. According\nto the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophers, the first four\nelements are of two types\u2014eternal and non-eternal. Atoms are\neternal, while composite \u2018wholes\u2019 are non-eternal, since\nevery product is eventually destroyed. Atoms, it is claimed, possess\nthe smallest magnitude (a\u1e47u-parim\u0101\u1e47a), are spherical\n(parima\u1e47\u1e0dala), indivisible, and eternal. Though\nquantitatively identical, each type of atom has specific attribute. An\nearth atom has odour, a water atom taste, a fire atom colour and an\nair atom has touch as specific attribute. What motivates an atomistic\nconception of nature? Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika thinkers offer a\ntwo-step argument to establish the existence of atoms. The first step\nis:\n\nEvery visible substance is composed of parts.\n\nTherefore, the smallest visible composite thing\u2014say, the\nsmallest mote seen in a sunbeam\u2014is also composed of parts, as it\nis visible, like a piece of cloth.\n\n\nThere are two presuppositions of this argument: (1) A part of a whole\nis always smaller in size than a whole\u2014a thesis of which no\ncounter-instance is available in our world; and (2) the parts of the\nsmallest visible composite thing are imperceptible. The second step of\nthe argument runs as follows:\n\nThe imperceptible part of the smallest visible thing must possess\nparts, if it is a composite thing.\nHowever, this division of composite things into its parts must\ncome to an end; otherwise there will be a vicious infinite regress\n(anavasth\u0101).\nSo, there must be partless, indivisible, imperceptible things,\nthings which are defined as atoms.\n\n\nBut why is a process of infinite division inadmissible? Because,\nreason the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas, a mountain and a mustard\nseed will then be equal in size: both being infinitely divisible, they\nwill have countless parts. One might object that the said division\nwill stop only when there is nothing left to be divided, but that this\nwould imply that the whole world can be created out of nothing; and\nthe idea of creation ex nihilo is not viable. But division is possible\nonly when there is a thing to be divided, something which forms the\nbase (\u0101dh\u0101ra) of division. A process of division annulling\nits base is as absurd a notion as digging a hole in empty space. To\navoid these inconsistencies, therefore, indivisible atoms must be\nadmitted.\n\nA theory is provided of atomic composition. There is a distinct order\nof combination of atoms. Two atoms of the same type combine to form a\ndyad (dya\u1e47uka) and three dyads of the same type combine to form\na triad (trya\u1e47uka), which is held to be the smallest perceptible\nobject. Triads combine in varying numbers to give rise to large\ncomposite wholes of different shapes and sizes. Dyads are also thought\nas the \u2018\u0101rambhaka\u2019\u2014that from which the process\nof creation starts, the atoms being eternal are uncreated and continue\nto exist when a creation comes to an end.\n\nThere are two main puzzles about the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\ntheory of composition. First, why can\u2019t two atoms of different\ntypes form a dyad? An answer is, if an earth atom and a water atom\ncombine to produce a dyad, to which type will the resultant belong? It\ncannot belong to both types possessing two exclusive class-characters,\nnor can the resultant be of a mixed type, for then we shall never have\nany natural kind of perceptible dimension. The second issue here is\nwhy three atoms or two dyads cannot directly produce a composite\nobject. According to the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas, sticking to\nthe order of conjunction of atoms is important to explain how\nperceptible magnitude arises at the stage of triad from the\ncombination of its imperceptible components. If an atom is of\nimperceptible magnitude, so will be the magnitude of a dyad, for a\nquality of a part produces in the whole the same quality in greater\ndegree. Now if the dyads are imperceptible, then by the same logic a\ntriad will also be imperceptible. If this process continues, then\nthere will never be any composite object of perceptible dimension. So\nthe Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas need to give a rational\njustification for the perceptibility of a triad. They uphold that,\nunlike other qualities, the magnitude of a compound is not caused by\nthe magnitude of its components. The gross magnitude of a composite\nwhole is a resultant either of the grossness of its component or the\nlooseness of their conjunction or of the plurality of their numbers.\nThe first alternative has already been rejected. The second\nalternative also is not acceptable to the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas because they do not admit any\ninterstice between two atoms. So they endorse the last alternative\nthat the perceptible magnitude of a triad is caused by its number.\nSome think that triads of different elements can combine to form\ntetrads, and so on. Since the atoms of different elements have\nspecific qualities, there would be different structural arrangements\n(vy\u016bha) in triads constituted by different types of atoms.\nDifferent qualities observed in large composite substances are due to\nsuch different structural arrangements of their components.\n\nLet us quickly review some other features of\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism. First, like the four material\nelements, mind (manas) is also said to be of corporeal nature and\natomic in magnitude though lacking in sensible quality. Material atoms\nhave specific sensible qualities and so are called\n\u2018bh\u016bta\u2019; both matter and mind are capable of movement\nand so designated \u2018m\u016brta\u2019. The four elements come\nclosest to a scientific conception of matter. Second, all atoms are\nsaid to be quantitatively identical and qualitatively different. Two\natoms belonging to different types can be easily differentiated by\ntheir specific attributes, but the problem arises while\ndifferentiating two atoms of the same type, say, two earth atoms. The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas therefore introduce in their ontology\na unique objective principle called \u2018vi\u015be\u1e63a\u2019\n(ultimate differentiator) for individuating atoms. Third, the wholes\nconstituted by atoms are not mere conjunctions of atoms, but are new\nentities inhering in their own parts. Fourth, the atomic theory is\nintimately connected with their theory of causation. A cause has been\ndefined in this system as an invariable, unconditional antecedent of\nan effect; an effect, on the other hand, is said to be the\ncounter-correlative of a prior absence. A counter-correlative of any\nabsence removes that absence. A pot is a counter-correlative of its\nprior absence because this absence of pot disappears as soon as the\npot is produced. Every effect is preceded by its prior absence, so\neach effect is a new production. Such theory of causation is known as\n\u0101rambhav\u0101da, the theory that an effect always comes into\nexistence out of a prior state of non-existence (as opposed to the\ntheory of existent effect (satk\u0101ryav\u0101da) advocated by the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya school). Causes are of two types: (a) common\n(s\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a) and (b) uncommon\n(as\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47a). A common cause is uniformly present\nbefore the occurrence of any effect whatsoever and is necessary for\neffectuation as such; an uncommon cause is that which invariably and\nunconditionally precedes a particular effect. Common causes are space,\ntime, accumulated merits and demerits of individual agents\n(ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da), God, knowledge, desire and will (prayatna)\nof God, and prior absence (pr\u0101gabh\u0101va). Uncommon causes are\ndivided into three classes: (a) inherent (samav\u0101yi), (b)\nnon-inherent (asamav\u0101yi) and (c) efficient (nimitta). Without\nentering into their technical definitions, let us understand them with\nthe help of an example. Atoms are the inherent causes of the world,\nconjunctions of atoms are its non-inherent causes, and God and\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da are its efficient causes. Fifth, admitting\nnumbers as the cause of grossness of a triad shows that they have a\ncapacious world-view where numbers can have causal effect on the\nphysical world.\n\nFor a consideration of early modern Ny\u0101ya discussions of atomism\nin India in contrast with mechanical philosophy in Europe, see Ganeri\n2011, chapter 14.\n",
