    "main_text": "Recent Theories || Christus Victor Theories\n5.1 Christus Victor Theories\n\nAul\u00e9n\u2019s (1930 [1931]) study of patristic views of\natonement led to a flourishing of that approach in theological\nliterature into the twenty-first century. Christus Victor views\nhighlight the ransom motif from scripture: humans are in some way\nenslaved to the power of sin and their only escape from its power can\ncome from a rescuer, Jesus Christ, who will free humans from its\npower. However, contemporary views rarely espouse the ransom theory\ndescribed above.\n\nSome, such as Gregory Boyd (2006), take seriously Satan\u2019s\nexistence and the reality of demonic activity, and argue that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is aimed at undermining their influence\nover humans. Christ does this through his teaching, healing, and\nexorcism ministry. But his death and resurrection constitute his\nultimate defeat of Satan, as he allows Satan to influence humans to\nkill him, only to show that Satan cannot win. Christ\u2019s\nresurrection is central to atonement, on this view, as it is a\ndemonstration of defeat over Satan\u2019s worst.\n\nOthers, such as Darby Kathleen Ray (1998), J. Denny Weaver (2001), and\nWalter Wink (1992), demythologize the Christus Victor view. What\nhumans need to be freed from is not literal demons, but a sort of\ndepersonalized power of evil that humans have allowed to infect their\ninstitutions, organizations, and cultures. Christ combats the power of\nevil nonviolently. In doing so, particularly through his death, he\nunmasks evil by showing it at its worst. When humans see evil\nunmasked, and then see that Christ defeats its worst by being\nresurrected, humans are drawn instead to God\u2019s way of life and\nhis response to evil.\n\nChristus Victor theories have been criticized on various grounds (some\nare only relevant to certain specific theories). First, they do not\naccount for the importance of Christ\u2019s crucifixion for atonement\n(Thurow 2021a). The victory over the powers could have been obtained\nin so many ways (and indeed is obtained in ways other than his death)\nnot involving the death of the innocent son of God. Second, they\ndownplay individual responsibility for sin (Schreiner 2006b). This can\nmake it seem like the Christus Victor accounts don\u2019t offer a\ntheory of atonement since they do not explain how the wrong done to\nGod by human sin is resolved (Crisp 2020a: 55). Lastly, if the primary\nmechanism of atonement is to free humans from the power of sin,\nempirical evidence indicates that this hasn\u2019t been achieved\n(Reichenbach 2006). And yet, Christ is said to have already atoned for\nhuman sin.\n",
