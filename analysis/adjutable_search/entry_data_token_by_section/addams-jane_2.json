Addams\u2019 Standpoint Epistemology\n\nAlthough writing long before the term \u201cstandpoint\nepistemology\u201d was named by feminist philosophers, Addams can be\nconsidered a forerunner of standpoint epistemology, given her\ncommitment to sympathetic knowledge. Feminist philosophers have\nattended to the impact of context on theory more than mainstream\nphilosophers. Although there are lively debates within feminist\nphilosophical circles regarding the nature of objectivity, many,\nincluding Dorothy Smith, Nancy Hartsock, Hilary Rose, Alison Jaggar,\nand Sandra Harding, have developed the notion that knowledge is indeed\nsituated. In particular, feminist standpoint theorists valorize the\nperspectives and theories derived from oppressed societal positions,\nsuch as women\u2019s experiences. Harding describes a feminist\nstandpoint as something to achieve rather than a passive perspective.\nAll women have lived experience in a woman\u2019s body and therefore\nhave a woman\u2019s perspective. Still, a feminist standpoint\nrequires an effort at stepping back to gain a holistic picture of\npower struggles. Through the understanding of the perspectival aspect\nof knowledge claims, standpoint epistemology can create libratory\nknowledge that can be leveraged to subvert oppressive systems. One of\nthe challenges of standpoint theory is how to give voice to multiple\npositions without falling back on hierarchies that favor certain\nstandpoints over others.\n\nJane Addams demonstrates an appreciation for the spirit of standpoint\ntheory through her work and writing at Hull-House. Despite the\nprivileged social position she was born into, her settlement avocation\nimmersed her in disempowered communities. Addams poetically describes\nher moral mandate to meet, know, and understand others: \u201cWe know\nat last, that we can only discover truth by a rational and democratic\ninterest in life, and to give truth complete social expression is the\nendeavor upon which we are entering. Thus the identification with the\ncommon lot that is the essential idea of Democracy becomes the source\nand expression of social ethics. It is as though we thirsted at the\ngreat wells of human experience because we know that a daintier or\nless potent draught would not carry us to the end of the journey,\ngoing forward as we must in the heat and jostle of the crowd\u201d\n(DSE 9). One might object that although these are admirable\nsentiments, they are still spoken by an outsider. What constitutes an\noutsider? Addams lived the better part of a half-century in the\ndiverse immigrant neighborhood of Hull House in Chicago. She\ndidn\u2019t return home to the suburbs or return to a university\noffice with her data. She lived and worked amongst the crime, civic\ncorruption, prostitution, sweatshops, and other community ills. When\nthey started Hull House, Addams and Starr were involved\noutsiders\u2014an oddity that neighbors looked upon suspiciously.\nHowever, time, proximity, and an earnest desire to learn and help won\nthe trust and respect of the neighborhood. The outsiders became\ninsiders. When Addams wrote or spoke about single women laborers,\nchild laborers, prostitutes, or first and second-generation\nimmigrants, she employed first-hand knowledge gained from her social\ninteractions. Addams leveraged her Hull House experiences to give\nvoice to standpoints marginalized in society. Simultaneously, she\nworked to provide the oppressed their own voice through college\nextension courses, English language courses, and social clubs that\nfostered political and social debate. Addams was self-conscious about\nspeaking for others: \u201cI never addressed a Chicago audience on\nthe subject of the Settlement and its vicinity without inviting a\nneighbor to go with me, that I might curb my hasty generalization by\nthe consciousness that I had an auditor who knew the conditions more\nintimately than I could hope to do\u201d (TYH 80). Addams did not try\nto arrive at universal moral truths but recognized that the standpoint\nof Hull House neighbors mattered.\n\nIn an 1896 article in The American Journal of Sociology,\n\u201cA Belated Industry,\u201d Addams addresses the plight of women\nin domestic labor. These were the most powerless of laborers:\npredominantly women, many of them immigrants with limited English\nlanguage skills and in a job that afforded little legal protection or\norganizing possibilities. Addams begins the article with a footnote\nclaiming that her knowledge of domestic laborers comes from her\nexperience with the Woman\u2019s Labor Bureau, one of the many Hull\nHouse projects. Addams goes on to address the powerlessness of\ndomestic work, particularly as it entails isolation and a highly\ninequitable power relationship: \u201cThe household\nemploy\u00e9[sic] has no regular opportunity for meeting other\nworkers of her trade, and of attaining with them the dignity of\ncorporate body\u201d (ABI 538). Addams identifies the gendered\ndimension of this oppressive work: \u201cmen would \u2026 resent\nthe situation and consider it quite impossible if it implied the\ngiving up of their family and social ties, and living under the roof\nof the household requiring their services\u201d (ABI 540). Addams\nextrapolates her experience of these workers to imaginatively inhabit\na standpoint and give them voice. She explicitly claims as much,\n\u201cAn attempt is made to present this industry [domestic labor]\nfrom the point of view of those women who are working in households\nfor wages\u201d (ABI 536). Addams repeatedly recognized the\nexperiences of oppressed peoples that she came to know to have\ntheir concerns acknowledged in the social democracy she was trying to\nfoster.\n\nAddams believed recognizing alternative standpoints was important in\npromoting social progress through sympathetic understanding.\nAccordingly, if a voice is given to individuals inhabiting\nmarginalized positions in society, it fosters the possibility of\nbetter understanding between people and actions that can lead to\nimproving their lot. Addams engaged in the tricky balance of honoring\nstandpoints while simultaneously seeking connections and continuities\nto build upon. This is exemplified in Addams\u2019 books on young\npeople, Youth and the City Streets, and elderly women,\nThe Long Road of Woman\u2019s Memory. The latter work is a\ntreatise on memory based on the memories of first-generation immigrant\nwomen. Rather than grounding her theory upon the experiences of famous\nwomen theorists or writers\u2014and Addams knew most of the prominent\nwomen of her day\u2014Addams based her analysis on the women who were\nher neighbors at Hull House. Addams not only grounded her\nphilosophical work in experience but in the experiences of those on\nthe margins of society. Addams puts experience before theory. She did\nnot begin by positing a theory about these women. Instead, she retold\nmany stories she had heard from them and then drew out conclusions\nabout the function of memory. For Addams, theory follows experience.\nAddams was in the minority among her peers in philosophy or feminism\nto believe that working-class immigrant women not only should be given\na voice but also had something important to contribute to the\ncommunity of ideas.\n\nAn example of Addams\u2019 application of feminist standpoint theory\n(or at least a forerunner of it) can be seen in the \u201cDevil\nBaby,\u201d which recounts what transpired after three Italian women\ncame to Hull House to see a possessed infant. One can form a whimsical\nimage from Addams\u2019 account, \u201cNo amount of denial convinced\nthem that he was not there, for they knew exactly what he was like\nwith his cloven hoofs, his pointed ears, and diminutive tail; the\nDevil Baby had, moreover, been able to speak as soon as he was born\nand was shockingly profane\u201d (LRW 7\u20138). This would be an\namusing anecdote if it stopped there, but Addams described a six-week\nperiod when Hull House was inundated with stories about the alleged\nDevil Baby. Visitors even offered Hull House residents money to see\nthe creature despite adamant responses that there was no such baby.\nMultiple versions of how the Devil Baby arose in the neighborhood, and\neventually the hysteria made the newspapers. One version of the story\nclaimed that the Devil Baby was the offspring of an atheist and a\ndevoted Italian girl. When the husband tore a holy picture from the\nwall claiming that he would rather have a devil in the house, his wish\nwas granted in the form of his coming child (LRW 8). Although a\nfascinating social phenomenon, the Devil Baby story has little\napparent philosophical importance. It would be easy to dismiss those\nwho perpetuated the story as simpletons caught up in the hysteria. Not\nfor Jane Addams. She applied a familiar approach by refusing to pass\njudgment, listening carefully, and developing a sympathetic\nunderstanding. Addams actively worked to grasp their subject\nposition.\n\nAlthough Addams dismissed the \u201cgawkers\u201d who came to see\nthe Devil Baby as a sensationalist-seeking mob, she wanted to\nunderstand the older women who had perpetuated the myth:\n\u201cWhenever I heard the high eager voices of old women, I was\nirresistibly interested and left anything I might be doing in order to\nlisten to them\u201d (LRW 9). She found women who were solemn and\nhighly animated about the Devil Baby. They used the appearance of the\nDevil Baby and the excitement it created as an opportunity to discuss\nimportant and troubling matters of their life. Addams, who never\nsought simple answers to complex issues, found a convergence of class,\nrace, and gender dynamics fueling the Devil Baby phenomenon. These\nimmigrant women were in unfamiliar surroundings and had to adjust to\nforeign ideas and practices. They had been alienated by their\nchildren, who adapted to the new country more quickly, keeping the old\nways at arm\u2019s length. Many of these women also had been victims\nof domestic abuse long before such acts had a distinct label. One\nwoman tells Addams, \u201cMy face has this queer twist for now nearly\nsixty years; I was ten when it got that way, the night after I saw my\nfather do my mother to death with his knife\u201d (LRW 11). For these\nforgotten and beaten women, the Devil Baby represented a connection to\na past that made more sense to them: one that had clear moral\nimperatives. Another woman tells Addams, \u201cYou might say\nit\u2019s a disgrace to have your son beat you up for the sake of a\nbit of money you\u2019ve earned by scrubbing\u2014your own man is\ndifferent\u2014but I haven\u2019t the heart to blame the boy for\ndoing what he\u2019s seen all his life, his father forever went wild\nwhen the drink was in him and struck me to the very day of his death.\nThe ugliness was born in the boy as the marks of the Devil was born in\nthe poor child up-stairs\u201d (LRW 11). Addams\u2019 recounting of\ntale after tale of violence provides a depressing view of immigrant\nwomen\u2019s lives at the turn of the century. For women who had\nlived such a hard life, the Devil Baby provided a momentary\nopportunity for resistance. Husbands and children would listen to them\nand temporarily forsake beating them for fear of divine retribution as\nevinced by the Devil Baby. Addams describes memory as serving to\n\u201cmake life palatable and at rare moments even beautiful\u201d\n(LRW 28). Although this is a specific explanatory analysis, it\ndemonstrates how Addams sought connections among the personal stories:\n\u201cWhen these reminiscences, based upon the diverse experiences of\nmy people unknown to each other, point to one inevitable conclusion,\nthey accumulate into a social protest \u2026\u201d (LRW 29). Addams\nproceeds to view the Devil Baby in light of the women\u2019s movement\nand the fight against oppression. Given the position of the old women,\nthe Devil Baby was the vehicle of resistance and an opportunity for\nAddams to interject feminist analysis.\n4. Radical Meliorism\n\nMeliorism is a hallmark of pragmatist philosophy, which we can see in\nAddams\u2019 work with a more radical character than among other American\npragmatists. If \u201cradical\u201d is defined as challenging\nexisting power structures, Jane Addams was the least elitist and\nthe most radical of the American philosophers of her era. Addams\nconsistently took and eloquently supported inclusive positions that\nsought the benefit of society. While pragmatists typically advocated\nfor social progress, Addams radicalized the extent of that social\nprogress. Rather than defining progress by the best and brightest\nachievements, Addams advocates the betterment of all in what she calls\n\u201clateral progress.\u201d For Addams, lateral progress meant\nthat social advancement could not be declared through the\nbreakthroughs or peak performances of a few but could only\nauthentically be found in social gains held in common. Addams employs\nmetaphor to explain the concept:\n\n\nThe man who insists upon consent, who moves with the people, is bound\nto consult the feasible right as well as the absolute right. He is\noften obliged to attain only Mr. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cbest\npossible,\u201d and often have the sickening sense of compromising\nwith his best convictions. He has to move along with those whom he\nrules toward a goal that neither he nor they see very clearly till\nthey come to it. He has to discover what people really want, and then\n\u201cprovide the channels in which the growing moral force of their\nlives shall flow.\u201d What he does attain, however, is not the\nresult of his individual striving, as a solitary mountain climber\nbeyond the sight of the valley multitude, but it is underpinned and\nupheld by the sentiments and aspirations of many others. Progress has\nbeen slower perpendicularly, but incomparably greater because\nlateral.\n\nHe has not taught his contemporaries to climb mountains, but he has\npersuaded the villagers to move up a few feet higher. (AML 175)\n\n\nWhether one refers to them as \u201crobber barons\u201d or\n\u201ccaptains of industry,\u201d the rise of commerce in the United\nStates was defined by the winners of the game: those who amassed\nwealth. The wealthy enjoyed tremendous progress in healthcare,\neducation, and material well-being. Addams was not satisfied with\nnarrow social development and redefined progress according to the\ncommon person\u2019s experience. This redefinition continues to elude\nus today as class disparity in the United States grows. Ironically,\nAddams is often chastised for expounding middle-class values, which\nwas her point of reference as she started Hull House.\nStill, Addams\u2019 experiences pushed her to understand and\nappreciate the immigrant poor in the neighborhood more fully.\n\nAddams applied the idea of lateral progress to numerous issues. When\nshe discusses the role of labor unions, she argues that in their\nattempt to improve conditions for all workers, unions are fulfilling a\nvital function that society has abrogated. Addams, who had a track\nrecord of supporting labor, makes it clear that she does not view\ncollective bargaining as an end in itself. Instead, Addams views\nunions as trailblazers who obtain working conditions that eventually\nbenefit everyone in society: \u201ctrade unions are trying to do for\nthemselves what the government should secure for all its citizens;\nhas, in fact, secured in many cases\u201d (FSS 456). Addams is not\ninterested in improving the lot of one group of workers over another.\n\u201cAny sense of division and suspicion is fatal in a democratic\nform of government, for although each side may seem to secure most for\nitself when consulting only its own interests, the final test must be\nthe good of the community as a whole\u201d (FSS 461). For Addams,\nunions are important in as much as they improve working conditions,\nraise wages, reduce hours and eliminate child labor for all\nAmericans\u2014lateral progress.\n\nAlthough the first chapter of Addams\u2019 Democracy and Social\nEthics is ostensibly a critique of charity workers and their\npreconceived notions of the needs of the destitute, it also reveals\nAddams\u2019 disposition toward the poor and the oppressed. She\ndecries the historical position of blaming the victim:\n\u201cFormerly, when it was believed that poverty was synonymous with\nvice and laziness and that the prosperous man was the righteous man,\ncharity was administered harshly with a good conscience; for the\ncharitable agent really blamed the individual for his poverty, and the\nvery fact of his own superior prosperity gave him a certain\nconsciousness of superior morality\u201d (DSE 11\u201312). Such a\njudgment serves to separate the wealthy from the poor. Accordingly,\nthe rich can make progress intellectually, materially,\ntechnologically, etc., while the poor are thought to be left behind\nprimarily due to their own actions. Addams argues that the poor are\noften victims of circumstance and that it is society\u2019s responsibility\nto first understand marginalized people and then develop means for\ntheir participation in lateral progress.\n\nCharity, although a good, is not lateral progress. While noble, a\ntemporary transfer in wealth does not constitute real progress in\nalleviating economic disparity. Addams never viewed herself as a\ncharity worker, nor did she characterize the work of Hull House as\ncharity: \u201cI am always sorry to have Hull House regarded as\nphilanthropy\u201d (ONS 45). Addams sought lateral progress that\ncould be brought about by the collective will and manifested through\nsocial institutions. She believes there would be no need for\nsettlements if \u201csociety had been reconstructed to the point of\noffering equal opportunity for all\u201d (ONS 27). Addams is not\nadvocating a laissez-faire capitalism version of equal\nopportunity that is abstract and rights-based. Free market economics\ninfluences modern understandings of democracy as merely assuring the\nadequate opportunity to participate. Addams\u2019 approach to equal\nopportunity is set in a context of vibrant democracy where citizens\nand social organizations look out for one another because they all\nhave a stake in lateral progress or what today might be termed\ndemocratic socialism.\n\nAddams\u2019 radical pragmatism ultimately had a feminist dimension.\nShe continually gave voice to women\u2019s experiences, addressed\nwomen\u2019s issues, and saw a vibrant social democracy as only\npossible if there was full participation by both men and women. When\nit came to issues such as women\u2019s suffrage, Addams manifests a\nfeminist pragmatism. \u201cIf women had no votes with which to select\nthe men upon whom her social reform had become dependent, some\ncherished project might be so modified by uninformed legislatures\nduring the process of legal enactment that the law, as finally passed,\ninjured the very people it was meant to protect. Women had discovered\nthat the unrepresented are always liable to be given what they do not\nwant by legislators who merely wish to placate them\u201d (STY\n89\u201390). Note that Addams does not argue the application of\nabstract human rights, but she instead makes a functional claim about\nthe role of voting in proper democratic representation. It is not that\nAddams opposes rights, but she will continually opt for pragmatist\narguments on feminist issues. Her male pragmatist colleagues were\nsympathetic to feminist positions but did not make the claims as\nforcefully or consistently as Addams (Seigfried, 1996).\n\nAddams\u2019 notion of lateral progress exemplifies again how she has\nbeen misrepresented as merely a reformer. Radical discourse, a la\nMarx, has been associated with the call for extreme changes in social\ninstitutions and systems. Although such changes may be arguably\ndesirable, they entail upheaval that will disrupt social relationships\nat significant potential personal cost. Addams sought substantial\nsocial progress through mutual agreement and tapping into communal\nintelligence. Her radical vision refused to give up on the individuals\nin society and their caring relationships. Mixing theoretical notions\nof social change with concrete experiences of community organizing,\nAddams was a caring radical. Addams was interested in ameliorating\nsocial problems, but that does not preclude a broadly construed\nradical edge to her social philosophy.\n5. Socializing Care\n\nAn analysis of Addams\u2019 moral philosophy suggests at least three\nclaims about her relationship to feminist care ethics avant la\nlettre. One, Addams\u2019 approach to the important social\nissues of her day reflected the relationality and contextualization\nthat are important to what is called care ethics today. Two, although\nAddams employed caring in response to the needs of others, she\ncontributes an active, even assertive, dimension to care ethics not\ncommonly found in feminist theory. Third, Addams advocates what might\nbe called \u201csocializing care\u201d: systemically instantiating\nthe habits and practices of care in social institutions.\n\nAlthough care is a simple and widely invoked word, many feminist\ntheorists have invested it with a particular meaning as it applies to\nethics. The original motivation for developing care ethics was an\nacknowledgment that traditional forms of morality, in particular\nprinciple-based and consequence-based ethics, did not adequately\naddress the richness of the human condition. These approaches bracket\nout emotions, relationships, temporal considerations, reciprocity, and\ncreativity to focus on immediate adjudication of moral conflicts.\nAccordingly, the use of rules or consequences can become a\nreductionist and formulaic response resulting in shortsighted answers\nto complex and systemic issues. For care ethicists, principles can be\nuseful, but a concern for interpersonal connection tempers them.\nPrinciples and consequences can be important in moral\ndeliberation, but care theorists seek a more robust and complex sense\nof morality that cannot ignore the context and people involved. For\nexample, the claim that people who spray-paint graffiti on a building\nought to be punished because they have damaged someone else\u2019s\nproperty (rule/principle violation) will likely receive widespread\nassent. Care ethicists do not necessarily deny such an assertion, but\nthey want to know more. The person doing the spray-painting is a human\nbeing whose motivations and circumstances may reveal other variables\nnot sufficiently addressed by the mere recognition of rule violations.\nSystemic issues involving social opportunities, discrimination, or\nlack of voice may have contributed to this behavior. Care ethicists\nshift the moral focus from abstract individuals and their actions to\nconcrete, situated people with feelings, friends, and\ndreams\u2014persons who can be cared about. Care ethics demands\neffort, experience, knowledge, imagination, and empathy to effectively\nunderstand the totality of the moral context. The result is not an\nexoneration of personal responsibility but a richer understanding of\nthe human condition where we are all actors and acted upon.\n\nAddams consistently moves beyond formulaic moral accounts of\nprinciples or consequences to apply a kind of care ethics to her\nexperiences in the Hull House neighborhood. Proximity is once again\ncrucial as she has direct experience with individuals, providing the\nresources for a caring response. However, as a philosopher, Addams\nextrapolates her experiences to theorize about others of similar\ncircumstances. For example, in The Spirit of Youth and the City\nStreets Addams addresses juvenile delinquency. She recounts\ncharges against young men who were brought before the Juvenile Court\nin Chicago (which Hull House had helped establish). These charges were\ncategorized by type, such as stealing, which included the pilfering of\npigeons, blankets, and a bicycle. Another category was disorderly\nconduct which included picking up coal from railroad tracks, throwing\nstones at railroad employees, and breaking down a fence. There was\nalso vagrancy, which included loafing, sleeping on the streets all\nnight, and wandering (SYC 56\u201357). Addams does not deny the\nseriousness of some of these infractions, but she does not rush to\njudgment, instead choosing to investigate the context further. She\ntalks to the young men and asks them about their motivations. She\nidentifies a listlessness, a desire for adventure not quieted by what\nthe city has to offer: \u201ctheir very demand for excitement is a\nprotest against the dullness of life, to which we ourselves\ninstinctively respond\u201d (SYC 71). Addams views the city as built\naround the possibility of factory production but ignores the needs of\nfuture workers. Among \u201cjuvenile delinquents,\u201d Adams\nfinds many young people who simply seek adventure and excitement\nbecause their lives have little of it. Had Addams merely abstracted\nyouth as a category of individuals who seem prone to break the law,\nshe could have easily found principles to judge them negatively.\nHowever, Addams saw them as humans, many of whom she witnessed growing\nup in the neighborhood, and she cared for them beyond the alienating\nlabel of \u201ctroubled youth.\u201d\n\nMore than merely prefiguring care ethics, Addams infuses a high social\nresponsibility standard into this moral approach. Addams advocates a\nduty of social awareness and engagement, thus creating the potential\nfor care. Many care ethicists are wary of the notion of duty as it has\nbeen traditionally formulated. Moral duties have historically entailed\nclaims regarding actions that a person is required to offer on behalf\nof another. Because the \u201cother\u201d is an abstract other and\nthe requirements are universalized (I must act in such a way in all\ncases), duties toward others have tended toward moral minimums of\nobligation. For example, a moral obligation to act is present if\nsomeone\u2019s life is in peril and minimal effort is required to\nprevent it, such as an infant drowning in 3 inches of bathwater.\nAlthough such cases get widespread agreement, it becomes more\nchallenging to ascertain what obligation one has to distant others\nwith unclear expectations of success. For example, many Americans have\ndisposable income that could save the life of someone in a\npoverty-stricken country on a distant continent; do they have a moral\nobligation to give them money, and to what extent? Addams constructs\nthe duty to care differently. Hers is an epistemological demand.\nAddams claims that good citizens actively pursue knowledge of\nothers\u2014not just facts but a more profound\nunderstanding\u2014for the possibility of caring and acting on their\nbehalf: \u201cif we grow contemptuous of our fellows, and consciously\nlimit our intercourse to certain kinds of people whom we have\npreviously decided to respect, we not only tremendously circumscribe\nour range of life, but limit our scope of ethics\u201d (DSE 8). For\nAddams, care ethics must be actively pursued, not passively fostered.\nAddams\u2019 language is more assertive than much of the current care\nethics discourse.\n\nFinally, Addams extends care ethics to the public realm. She is not\ncontent to compartmentalize personal and social morality. Caring is\nwhat she desires for democracy and its various institutions. Addams\nviews the residents of social settlements, for example, as having\n\u201can opportunity of seeing institutions from the\nrecipient\u2019s standpoint\u201d because they are not distant\ninstitutions but neighbors. She finds this perspective significant and\nbelieves that it should ultimately \u201cfind expression in\ninstitutional management\u201d (OVS 39). Furthermore, she\ndifferentiates the epistemological project of the settlement from the\nuniversity in language that acknowledges a caring element: \u201cThe\nsettlement stands for application as opposed to research; for emotion\nas opposed to abstraction, for universal interest as opposed to\nspecialization\u201d (FSS 189). While social settlements epitomize a\ndemocratic endeavor for Addams, she applies the same caring values to\nother institutions. The creation of the juvenile courts in Chicago\nrepresented an example of caring because it mandated contextualized\nregard for the context of young people. The creation of adult\neducation that addressed tangible and contemporary issues also\ndemonstrated a caring regard for the needs of Hull-House neighbors.\nPerhaps most of all, the comportment of the Hull-House residents\nmanifested care ethics in their willingness to listen, learn and\nrespond. Addams viewed socializing care as participating in a rich\nideal of democracy.",
