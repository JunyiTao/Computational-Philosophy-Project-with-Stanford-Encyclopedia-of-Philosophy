States of Affairs as Complexes\n\nIn the previous sections we have seen that states of affairs can only\nplay important explanatory roles if the necessarily co-obtaining\nstates of affairs are distinct. This gives us a reason to reject\nChisholm\u2019s (1976: 118) thesis that necessarily co-obtaining\nstates of affairs are identical. At the same time it puts weight on\nthe characterization of states of affairs as \u201cinvolving\u201d\nobjects and properties or as composed out of objects and properties.\nIt seems intuitively plausible that the state of affairs\nSocrates\u2019s being wise involves Socrates and the\nproperty of being wise. But in what way do states of affairs involve\nparticulars and properties?\n",
