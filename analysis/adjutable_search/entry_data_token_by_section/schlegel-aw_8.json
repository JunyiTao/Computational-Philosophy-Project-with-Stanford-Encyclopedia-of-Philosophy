    "main_text": "The Role of the Critic and Schlegel\u2019s Romantic Nationalism || Between Enlightenment and Romanticism\n6.1 Between Enlightenment and Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic vision of the great artist as an exceptional individual,\nan unrepeatable genius, creator of his own rules, of his own style,\nleaves the figure of the philosopher and essayist in a rather\ndifficult position. The art critic has a very different task from that\nof the artist. As a critic, Schlegel conceives his activity as an\neducational and moral one, something which he definitely does not\ndemand from the artist. \u201cArt needs the discourse of art history\nfor its artistry to become visible\u201d (Schulte-Sasse [1985] 1988:\n137). Certainly, in order to appreciate correctly the work of the\nartist, in order to avoid being dazed by superficialities, the art\ncritic also has to have an inner feeling, a certain genius. But his\ntask is not to create, but to comprehend and to educate the public in\ntheir taste, to enable them to value the new, modern artistic\nproductions with a profound understanding of their significance. For,\n\n\n\nwhat ennobles human nature [is] to recognize and respect whatever is\nbeautiful and grand under those external modifications which are\nnecessary to their existence, and which sometimes even seem to\ndisguise them. There is no monopoly of poetry for certain ages and\nnations. (LDA: 2) \n\n\nThroughout Schlegel\u2019s entire work the Romantic ideals are in\nfact embedded in an enlightenment project.\n\nThus in the 1809 preface to the publication of his Lectures on\nDramatic Art, Schlegel argued that his main purpose was not so\nmuch to transmit an indifferent account of the history of dramatic\npoetry, but most importantly to \u201cdevelop those ideas which ought\nto guide us in our estimate\u201d (LDA: vii). His objective was to\nliberate his listeners and readers from what he calls a\n\u201cdespotism in taste\u201d (LDA: 2), that is, to release them,\nboth from their provincial prejudices towards unknown cultures and\nfrom the new tendencies developing in German literature. He wanted to\nprepare the German public for a (future) German Romantic theatre.\n\nIn a similar fashion, Schlegel argued that in order to appreciate art\nproductions from past cultures and remote nations, an acquaintance not\nonly with the actual work of art is indispensable, but also with its\nhistorical and cultural background: it is imperative to understand the\npeculiarities of their culture and history as a whole. The profound\ncomprehension of History is the basis for any comprehension of art and\nlanguages, which necessarily bears a direct relationship with the\nhistorical conditions circumscribing it (KS: I, x). As a consequence,\nSchlegel introduced in all of his lectures historical, social, and\ncultural observations; because for him, the aim of the critic is,\nprimarily, to reconcile the division between theory and experience,\ni.e., between a philosophical and a historical approach. Such was the\nbalance Schlegel sought to achieve in his lectures between what would\nbe a purely theoretical comprehension of tragedy and the consideration\nof the theatre as such, with all the historical, architectural and\ncultural characteristics that conditioned the actual performance of\nthe play.\n\nThe critic of art and history needs to be a connoisseur in\nthe strictest sense of the word, for he must be able to explain the\nactual state of humanity from its most remote past. He needs to\ndistance himself sufficiently from his own time in order to be able to\nunderstand and judge it. The true critic must have a\n\u201cuniversality of mind\u201d so that he may leave aside his\n\u201cpersonal predilections\u201d (LDA: 5). Schlegel conceived his\nlectures as a true critique, and many years later, he still\nconsidered that this is what made his approach in his Lectures on\nDramatic Art and Literature unique (KS: I, xiii).\n\nIn the preface to the publication of his critical writings from 1828,\nSchlegel explains that the difficulty of his task as an art critic\nlies not so much in the critique or the judgment itself, or in the\nlaying out of the proper argument in demonstration of his views, as in\nfinding, i.e., creating the right concepts with which to\nexpress the effect and the impressions generated by a specific work of\nart (KS: I, xii). The genius of the critic is that he is able to use\nthe word \u2018romantic\u2019 in such a way that it may express the\nessence of an epoch. And, although Schlegel did not believe he\nactually had a big influence on the German public, by 1828 he did\nremark that a shift of taste had taken place in Europe, a shift that\nshowed how the Romantic ideals had in fact widely pervaded European\naudiences.\n",
