    "main_text": "Description and Characteristics || The Aim of the Discussion\n2.2 The Aim of the Discussion\n\nOnce the odd, ambiguous or puzzling sophisma-sentence is put\nforward, one should try to understand what it means, what it implies,\nand how it fits into or contradicts the particular theory under\nconsideration. This is called \u201csolving the\nsophisma,\u201d and it is the aim of the entire discussion.\nThe way solutions are sought and established is similar to the highly\nformalized scholastic method for determining a\n\u201cquestion\u201d:\n\nFirst, one has to examine the arguments pro and\ncontra.\nSecond, one has to present one\u2019s own solution to the\nproblem. (Sometimes this part of the discussion is preceded by certain\ntheoretical remarks or clarifications that make the terminology more\nprecise.)\nThird, one has to refute the arguments supporting the opposite\nanswer.\n\n2.2.1 Some examples\n\nOur first example comes from Peter of Spain\u2019s\nSyncategoreumata, chapter 4. The sophisma runs:\n\nOmne animal preter hominem est irrationale.\n\n(Every animal but man is irrational.)\n\n\nIn accordance with step (1), the pro and contra\narguments run:\n\n\nProof: The sentence \u2018Every animal is irrational\u2019 is false,\nand the only counterinstance is man. Therefore the sophisma\nis true.\n\nDisproof: Every animal but man is irrational. Therefore, every animal\nbut this man is irrational. And that is false.\n\n\nThis particular sophisma is put forward to test the logical\nbehaviour of the syncategorematic word \u2018but\u2019\n(preter), more specifically, to consider the question of what\nis excepted when we use an exceptive word.\n\nIn accordance with step (2), Peter of Spain solves the\nsophisma by saying that it is true without qualification, and\nthat the argument pro is sound.\n\nIn accordance with step (3), the argument contra is rejected\non the grounds that it is a fallacy, because in the sentence it starts\noff with, \u2018Every animal but man is irrational,\u2019 the\nexpression \u2018man\u2019 has simple supposition, that is, it\nstands for man in general, whereas in the second sentence,\n\u2018Therefore every animal but this man is irrational,\u2019 the\nexpression \u2018this man\u2019 has personal supposition, that is,\nit stands for an individual man. The second mistake in the disproof is\nthat it proceeds from a combination of something less general with the\ndistributive sign \u2018every\u2019 to a combination of something\nthat is more general with the distributive sign \u2018every\u2019:\nin the first sentence, \u2018every animal\u2019 ranges over every\nanimal other than man, whereas in the second sentence, the expression\n\u2018every animal\u2019 comprehends not only all the animals, but\nalso every man other than this one.\n\nThe underlying logical problem in this sophisma according to\nPeter\u2019s exposition is the question of what kind of distribution\nis involved in propositions containing an exceptive expression in\ncombination with the universal sign \u2018every\u2019. In this case,\nthe solution to the sophisma is quite straightforward, as the\ndisproof rests on an unwarranted change in distribution throughout the\nargument.\n\nAnother relatively simple example comes from Albert of Saxony,\nSophismata, sophisma xi. The sophisma\nruns:\n\nOmnes homines sunt asini vel homines et asini sunt asini.\n\n(All men are donkeys or men and donkeys are donkeys.)\n\n\nIn accordance with step (1), here are the pro and\ncontra arguments:\n\n\nProof: The sophisma is a copulative sentence (in modern\nlogical terminology, a conjunction) each part of which is true;\ntherefore the sophisma is true, since its analysis becomes:\n[All men are donkeys or men] and [donkeys are donkeys].\n\nDisproof: The sophisma is a disjunctive sentence each part of\nwhich is false; therefore the sophisma is false, since its\nanalysis becomes: [All men are donkeys] or [men and donkeys are\ndonkeys].\n\n\nThis is a sophisma of the second kind above, one that rests\non an ambiguity and can be read with a true interpretation or with a\nfalse interpretation. Many such sophismata, although not this\none, resist being translated from Latin into another language without\nlosing the ambiguity. For example, the sentence \u2018aliquem asinum\nomnis homo videt\u2019 can be translated by \u2018Every man sees a\ndonkey\u2019 as well as by \u2018There is a donkey that every man\nsees\u2019. Similarly, in solving sophismata, sometimes\nLatin word order is used as an arbitrary code for interpreting the\nsentence. For example, according to William Heytesbury, when the word\n\u2018infinite\u2019 is placed at the beginning of a sentence and\nbelongs to the subject, it has to be interpreted as a syncategorematic\nterm; in any other case, it is usually interpreted as a categorematic\nterm (Heytesbury, Sophismata, sophisma xviii,\nfol.130va). Such word-order codes might seem like reasonable\nregimentations of language to a Latin-speaker, but in translation they\noften seem quite implausible and forced. No such problems arise with\nthis example. (For clarity, square brackets have been inserted into\nthe proof and disproof above, in order to indicate the ambiguity of\nthe sophisma.)\n\nIn accordance with step (2) above, Albert of Saxony, who discusses\nthis sophisma, solves it by just saying that it is either\ntrue or false depending on which interpretation we choose. He then\ntakes the opportunity to review the basic principles governing the\ntruth-value of copulative and disjunctive sentences.\n\nIn accordance with step (3), we would normally be required to refute\nthe opposite answer. In this case, however, there is nothing to\nrefute, since Albert\u2019s solution accepts both the pro\nand the contra arguments (for different readings of the\nsophisma).\n\nIn general, a sophisma provided a good opportunity to discuss\nproblems related to a specific theoretical issue. For example, the\nsophisma \u2018Album fuit disputaturum\u2019\n(\u2018The white [thing] was about to dispute\u2019) in\nthirteenth-century Parisian literature elicited discussions of\nproblems connected with the theory of reference in tensed contexts,\nand also provided an opportunity to refute the positions others held\non this very controversial subject. This is why Pinborg 1977 (p. xv)\nsays, with reference to the body of literature devoted to discussions\nof sophismata, that at Paris in the thirteenth century,\n\u201cthe sophismata seem \u2014 within the faculty of arts\n\u2014 to play a role analogous to the Quaestiones\nquodlibetales [quodlibetal questions] in the faculty of\ntheology.\u201d The Catalogue of 13th Century Sophismata\n(Ebbesen and Goubier 2010) provides an extensive list of logical\nproblems and distinctions that were brought up under the guise of a\nsophisma. Again, many grammatical problems were also dealt\nwith in this way.\n2.2.2 Sophismata and the Roles of Syncategorematic Words\n\nIt is important to recognize that many sophismata contain\nsyncategorematic words that are responsible for their odd, ambiguous\nor puzzling character. They can be difficult to interpret, especially\nwhen more than one syncategorematic word occurs in one and the same\nsentence. In the sophismata literature, discussions of\nproblematic sentences are usually accompanied by an explanation of the\ndistinctions governing the use of syncategorematic words. In turn such\ndistinctions can help to interpret the sentence at issue.\n\nAn example of such a distinction is the following. The\nsophisma \u2018Only God being God is necessary\u2019\n(\u2018Tantum deum esse deum est necessarium\u2019)\ncontains the syncategorematic word \u2018only\u2019\n(\u2018tantum\u2019). The sophisma is solved by\nmaking a distinction between two different functions of the word\n\u2018only\u2019, in that the exclusion it makes can pertain to the\nexpression \u2018God\u2019, or to the entire phrase \u2018God being\nGod\u2019. In the former case the sentence is true, but in the latter\nit is false (Ebbesen and Goubier 2010, vol. I, p. 122). Another\nexample of a problematic sentence containing the disjunctive\nexpression \u2018or\u2019 is the sophisma \u2018Every\nproposition or its contradictory opposite is true\u2019. Some authors\nconsidered this proposition as true, but others thought it was\nambiguous. In one way, the distribution of \u2018every\u2019 could\nbe taken as ranging over the disjunction, in which case the\nproposition reads \u2018Any proposition or its contradictory is\ntrue\u2019, which is true. In another way, the disjunction could be\ntaken to cover the distribution, in which case the proposition reads\n\u2018Every proposition is true or every contradictory opposite is\ntrue\u2019, which is false. A final example of a distinction concerns\nthe sophisma \u2018The white can be black\u2019 (an awkward\ntranslation of the sentence \u2018Album potest esse\nnigrum\u2019), which can be taken to mean either \u2018The\nthing that is white can be black\u2019, which is true, or \u2018It\ncan be the case that the white thing is black\u2019 (at the same\ntime, that is), which is false. The truth or falsity of the\nproposition then depends on a scope distinction regarding the\nexpression \u2018can be\u2019.\n\nThe expression \u2018syncategorematic word\u2019 should be taken in\na broad sense here; it includes not only classical syncategorematic\nwords such as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018if\u2019,\n\u2018every\u2019, etc., but also expressions such as\n\u2018infinite\u2019 or \u2018whole\u2019, which can be used both\ncategorematically and syncategorematically. Thus, the sentence\n\u2018Infinita sunt finita\u2019 (\u2018The infinite are\nfinite\u2019 \u2014 another example of a sophisma that\ncannot be translated into English without disambiguating it) is false\nif \u2018infinite\u2019 is used categorematically, for in that case\nit reads, \u2018Things that are infinite are finite.\u2019 But it is\ntrue if \u2018infinite\u2019 is used syncategorematically, for in\nthat case it reads, \u2018Finite things are infinite in number\u2019\nor \u2018There are infinitely many finite things\u2019 (See\nHeytesbury, Sophismata, sophisma xviii, fol. 130va).\nThis is another example of the kind of distinction that was used to\nsolve the sophisma.\n\nMany sophismata too are what medieval logicians called\n\u2018exponible sentences\u2019\n(\u2018exponibilia\u2019); these are sentences that appear\nto be simple but actually imply several other sentences into which\nthey can be decomposed. For example, the sentence \u2018A\ndiffers from B\u2019, was said to be equivalent to\n\u2018A exists and B exists and A is not\nB\u2019, whereas the sentence \u2018A ceases to be\nwhite\u2019, was said to be equivalent either to \u2018Now A\nis white and immediately after this A will not be white\u2019\nor to \u2018Now A is not white and immediately before this\nA was white\u2019, depending on the theory.\n",
