    "main_text": "Mach\n1. Mach\n\nBetween the time of Newton and Leibniz and the 20th century,\nNewton\u2019s mechanics and gravitation theory reigned essentially\nunchallenged, and with that long period of dominance, Newton\u2019s\nabsolute space came to be widely accepted. At least, no natural\nphilosopher or physicist offered a serious challenge to Newton\u2019s\nabsolute space, in the sense of offering a rival theory that dispenses\nwith it. But like the action at a distance in Newtonian gravity,\nabsolute space continued to provoke philosophical unease. Seeking a\nreplacement for the unobservable Newtonian space, Neumann (1870) and\nLange (1885) developed more concrete definitions of the reference\nframes in which Newton\u2019s laws\n hold.[1]\n In these and a few other works, the concept of the set of\ninertial frames (those in which material bodies obey\nNewton\u2019s three laws of motion) was first clearly expressed,\nthough it was implicit in both remarks and procedures found in\nNewton\u2019s Principia. (See the entries on\n space and time: inertial frames\n and\n Newton\u2019s views on space, time, and motion)\n The most sustained, comprehensive, and influential attack on absolute\nspace was made by Ernst Mach in his Science of Mechanics\n(1883).\n\nIn a lengthy discussion of Newton\u2019s Scholium on\nabsolute space, Mach accuses Newton of violating his own\nmethodological precepts by going well beyond what the observational\nfacts teach us concerning motion and acceleration. Mach at least\npartly misinterpreted Newton\u2019s aims in the Scholium,\nand inaugurated a reading of Newton\u2019s bucket argument (and by\nextension the globes argument) that has largely persisted in the\nliterature since. (See\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories,\n section 4, for discussion of Newton\u2019s bucket argument.) Mach\nviewed the argument as directed against a \u2018strict\u2019 or\n\u2018general-relativity\u2019 form of relationism, and as an\nattempt to establish the existence of absolute space. (Strict\nrelationism denies that there is any such thing as an absolute motion;\nall motion is merely relative, i.e., is nothing more than changes of\nlocation relative to some arbitrarily chosen reference frame.) Mach\npoints out the obvious gap in the argument when so construed: the\nexperiment only establishes that acceleration (rotation) of the water\nwith respect to the Earth, or the frame of the fixed stars,\nproduces the tendency to recede from the center; it does not prove\nthat a strict relationist theory cannot account for the bucket\nphenomena, much less the existence of absolute space.\n\nThe reader of the entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: classical theories\n will recall that Newton\u2019s actual aim was simply to show that\nDescartes\u2019 two kinds of motion are not adequate to account for\nrotational phenomena. Newton\u2019s bucket argument showed that the\neffects of rotational motion could not be accounted for by means of\nthe motion of the water relative to its immediate surroundings (the\nbucket walls); Newton\u2019s thought experiment with two globes\nconnected by a cord was meant to show that one can determine whether\nthey are rotating about their common center (and if so, in which\ndirection) without needing any reference to anything external. By\npushing on opposite faces of the two globes and checking for an\nincrease or decrease in the tension in the cord, one can determine in\nwhich sense the spheres are in rotation, if they are rotating at\nall.\n\nAlthough Mach does not mention the globes thought experiment\nspecifically, it is easy to read an implicit response to it in the\nthings he does say: nobody is competent to say what would happen, or\nwhat would be possible, in a universe devoid of matter other than two\nglobes. In other words, Mach would question Newton\u2019s starting\npremise that the cord connecting the two globes in an otherwise empty\nuniverse might be under tension, and indeed under a wide range of\ndifferent quantities of tension. So, for Mach, neither the bucket nor\nthe globes can establish the existence of absolute space.\n",
