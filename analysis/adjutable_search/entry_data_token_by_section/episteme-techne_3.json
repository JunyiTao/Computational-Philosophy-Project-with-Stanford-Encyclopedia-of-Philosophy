    "main_text": "The Stoics\n4. The Stoics\n\nAmong the Stoics, the relation between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea is the richest and most focused of all the\naccounts we have so far considered. That relation is enmeshed in the\nStoic account of virtue, in which the two notions of knowledge and\ncraft flow together in forming the science and art of living. Zeno\nrefers to a techn\u00ea which cures the diseases of the soul\n(SVF, i.e. Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, I 323) and\nChrysippus says that practical judgment (phron\u00easis) is\na kind of techn\u00ea concerning the things having to do\nwith life (SVF II 909). While virtue is compared to a\ntechn\u00ea, it is also a complete and unshakeable\nunderstanding of the universe. It has then some of the features of an\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in Aristotle\u2019s strong sense.\nClearly, such a position rests on the basis of peculiar Stoic\ndoctrines. We can begin with the Stoic idea of impulse to action.\nDiogenes Laertius says that, according to the Stoics, an animal has\nself-preservation as the object of its first impulse\n(horm\u00ea). So, the first thing appropriate\n(oikeios) to every animal \u2013 including humans \u2013 is\nits own constitution and the consciousness of this. Impulse leads\nevery animal to seek what is appropriate to it and rejects what is not\nappropriate. In addition, the constitution of adult humans includes\nreason; so, reason supervenes on what would be purely automatic\nimpulses in other animals. Stoics say that reason is itself the\ncraftsman (technit\u00eas) of the adult\u2019s impulses\n(Diogenes Laertius 7.85\u20136).\n\nFor the Stoics, however, reason\u2019s being the craftsman of all\nadult human impulses does not imply a division between the rational\nand any non-rational parts of the soul. Orthodox Stoics do not divide\nthe soul into reason and non-rational desires. Without this division\nthere is no basis for a distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as an intellectual virtue and reason as\nexercising a kind of techn\u00ea with respect to some\nnon-rational element. Rather, there is only the reasoning\n(dianoia) and governing principle\n(h\u00eagemonikon) which is capable of opposite states and\nthus becomes either virtue or vice (Plutarch, On moral virtue\n441 C\u2013D). Moral weakness or hesitancy comes from alternating judgments\nabout what is morally right (446E\u2013447A). Such an account implies that\nreason controls impulse solely by its judgments. One\u2019s emotions,\nthen, are not independent of reason; they cannot pursue as good\nsomething different from what reason takes to be good. In those who do\nnot know what the good is, reason gives rise to mistaken impulses to\naction. For instance, the belief that health is good is mistaken\nbecause only virtue is good; still, this mistaken belief is expressed\nas fear at the prospect of losing one\u2019s health, which, in turn,\ncan move one to preserve health at the expense of virtue. However, in\nthe one who knows that virtue is the only good \u2013 the sage\n\u2013 reason, unimpeded by fear, gives rise to impulses that aim\nonly at virtue. If reason is the craftsman of impulse and if\ntechn\u00ea implies knowledge, then it molds one\u2019s\nimpulsive feelings, i.e., the ones that lead one to act, through\nknowledge of the good. \n\nHowever, this knowledge of the good locates what is good for the sage\nin what is good for the whole universe. Zeno says that the end of life\nis to live in accordance with nature. In fact, living in accordance\nwith nature is the same as virtue (Diogenes Laertius, 7.87).\nChrysippus modifies Zeno\u2019s claim when he says that living in\naccordance with virtue is equivalent to living in accordance with the\nexperience of what happens by nature. What happens by nature is\ngoverned by universal law, which is right reason pervading everything\nand is identical with Zeus, who is the leader of the governance of\neverything (Diogenes Laertius, 7.87\u20138). The consequence is that\nthe sage\u2019s reason, endowed with knowledge of the way right\nreason pervades the universe, supervenes on impulse with the good of\nthe whole in view. Chrysippus says that there is no other or more\nappropriate way of approaching the account of things which are good\nand bad or the virtues or happiness than from universal nature and\nfrom the governance of the universe. (Plutarch. On Stoic\nSelf-contradictions 1035 C\u2013D)\n\nAt this point, we can appreciate the way Stoicism presents a distinct\nview of the relation between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea. Socratic intellectualism holds that what one\nknows to be good is sufficient for one to do what is good; but it has\nno moral psychology to justify the claim. Finding the claim itself\nparadoxical, Plato explains the hesitancy to do what one knows to be\ngood by introducing non-rational elements into the soul. (See the\nentry on\n ancient ethical theory,\n especially the sections on Socrates and on Plato.) Finally, the\nStoics return to a form of Socratic intellectualism. However, Stoicism\nprovides the missing moral psychology with its doctrine of the unity\nof the soul. In the soul of the Stoic sage, the knowledge of the good\nis an unshakeable grasp of what is good both for the sage and for the\nwhole universe. Because of its unity, there is nothing in the soul of\nthe sage to oppose this knowledge. It is as though the Stoics assume\nthat, without opposition, this sort of knowledge would naturally pass\nover into action once the connection is made with a particular\nsituation. Any reason to think otherwise is false. One type of false\nopinion is theoretical (and external to moral reasoning) and comes\nfrom mistaken views about moral psychology that clutter the soul up\nwith non-rational parts. The other type is practical (and internal to\nmoral reasoning) and comes from failure to know that virtue is living\nin accordance with nature and is the only good. This type of false\nopinion gives rise to such emotions as fear, which impede living in\naccordance with nature. Once these are swept away, knowledge of what\nis good is motivation enough to act. In the sage, then, where the\nunity of the soul is perfected, the theoretical grasp characteristic\nof epist\u00eam\u00ea just is a techn\u00ea.\n\nThe way this techn\u00ea works is illustrated in another\nwidely held Stoic teaching, i.e., the unity of the virtues. Zeno held\nthat virtue is practical knowledge (phron\u00easis) in\nvarious forms. When phron\u00easis deals with what is owed\nto others it is justice (dikaiosun\u00ea); when it deals\nwith what should be chosen it is moderation\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea); when it deals with what must be\nendured it is courage (andreia). In all of these definitions\nZeno means phron\u00easis to be knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) (Plutarch, On moral virtue\n441A). According to Sextus, the Stoics say that\nphron\u00easis, being knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) of the good and the evil, provides a\ntechn\u00ea concerning life (SVF III 598). Here we can see\nthe \u2018sage\u2019 or fully perfected human being has a kind of\ninsight into what is good and bad in each situation of life. In its\nparticularity, this insight is like that of a master craftsman, who\nknows what is appropriate at each juncture of his practice. And like\nthe master craftsman, the sage reacts appropriately both in the way he\nfeels and in the way he acts.\n\nStill, there is room for a distinction between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea. Several\nauthors attribute to Zeno the notion that a techn\u00ea is a\nsystematic collection of cognitions (katal\u00eapseis)\nunified by practice for some goal advantageous in life (SVF I 73). The\ndifference between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea properly speaking is that the latter is\nsaid to be secure and unshakeable by reason (Stobaeus\n2.73,16\u201374,3). In general, however, techn\u00ea does\nnot have the same kind of stability (Cicero, On Ends III.50).\nIndeed, such technai as love of music, and liberal arts in\ngeneral, are not even called knowledge (Stobaeus, 2.67, 5\u201312; cf\nSeneca, Letters 88). Nevertheless, such distinctions between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea do not keep\nthe Stoics from characterizing virtue as techn\u00ea. This\nspecial techn\u00ea does consist in a secure and unshakeable\ninsight into what is appropriate at each juncture of life.\n\nA significant refinement of this techn\u00ea is found in\nCicero\u2019s On Ends. In Book V, Piso, representing the\nviews of Antiochus of Ascalon, gives an overview of philosophical\nschools. The account depends on the notion of the highest good\n(summum bonum) because differences about the highest good\ndefine the possible schools. The explication of these differences\nbegins with an analogy drawn from the crafts (artes,\nCicero\u2019s Latin for the Greek technai). First of all,\nthe art is different from its object. Second, as medicine is the art\nof health and navigation the art of guiding ships, so prudence\n(practical wisdom) is the art of how to live (vivendi ars est\nprudentia). Piso presents this last claim as common to all the\nschools, or at least as a good way to present an element which is\ncommon. Next he says that whatever prudence would aim for is something\nsuited to our nature and the object of natural impulse (what the\nGreeks call horm\u00ea). Stoics hold that prudence aims for\nthe primary objects of nature. The primary objects of nature include\nsuch things as life and health. However, Stoics do not hold that\nactually obtaining the primary objects of nature is the highest good.\nRather they maintain that making every effort to obtain them (i.e.,\nappropriate ones among them, given the circumstances), even if one is\nunsuccessful, is morality and is the only thing desirable for itself\nand the highest good (V.16\u201320).\n\nIf life and health are among the primary objects of nature, then the\nStoic teaching is that doing everything to obtain life and health is\nmorality. But this claim must be qualified; it is not moral to strive\nfor life and health in an unjust way. Another of the primary objects\nof nature is human solidarity. Thus, making every effort to obtain\nlife and health (and the other primary objects of nature) is the same\nas being virtuous, just as making every effort to cure a patient is\nthe same as following the craft of medicine. Whether the sage actually\nobtains life and health (or his other specific objectives in his\nactions) is beyond his control. Finally, however, virtuously striving\nfor these is more important than obtaining them \u2014 it is, in\nfact, the only true good.\n\nIn Book III, the Stoic Cato explains this complicated position. Human\nbeings begin life automatically and instinctively seeking the primary\nobjects of nature, but as their power of reason develops, they come to\nrealize, if they attain a correct understanding, that moral action is\nreally the end of life. So they shift the aim of their life, from the\nprimary objects of nature themselves to doing everything possible to\nattain them. Using an analogy to marksmanship, Cato says that someone\nwho makes it his purpose to hit the target would do everything he\ncould to hit the target. Thus, he says, his end would be to try\neverything he could. Cato\u2019s thought is that the sage will aim\nfor such things as health; however, the good \u2014 and therefore the\nend he seeks \u2014 is in the way he pursues health. Thus, actually\ngetting health is preferable to not getting it, but pursuing it in a\nmoral way is what is desirable in itself. So, he explains, wisdom\n(sapientia) is not like medicine or navigation but closer to\nacting and dancing, where the end is the exercise of the art and is in\nthe art itself and not external to it. Even this analogy to the art of\ndancing is not quite adequate. According to Cato, a virtuous action\nentails all the virtues; presumably he means, e.g., a just action is\nalso moderate and courageous. However, not every dance movement\nincludes all the possible dance steps (III. 22\u201325). In sum, the\nStoics give us the powerful idea that the excellent human life, and\nhappiness, is the same thing as performing in an artful way, striving\nfor a life of natural satisfactions, but actually finding ultimate\nvalue in the way one strives.\n",
