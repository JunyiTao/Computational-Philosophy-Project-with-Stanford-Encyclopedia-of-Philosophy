    "main_text": "Spinoza and the experimental and mathematical sciences || Mathematical science\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt is far from clear that any thorough and consistent account of\nSpinoza's physical theory can be found. He says too little that is\nfocused and direct, and the various partial and indirect discussions\nof such fundamental topics as inertia and the individuation of bodies\nare individually underdeveloped and problematic, as well as in\nprima facie tension with one another. A few general\ninterpretive strategies present themselves. We might take both his\nclaim that all determinations of extended modes of substance are\nextrinsically caused by other finite modes and his talk of essence and\nconatus seriously. On such a reading, Spinoza tried to develop an\necumenical account of bodies that both conformed to the mechanical\nprinciples of the Cartesian view and preserved the sense that bodies\nare centers of real activity; but his entitlement to that sense is\nhard to square with mechanism and only dubiously earned through the\nappeal to essences. We might, on the other hand, focus on either of\nthe two aspects of Spinoza's thinking about the physical, downplaying\nthe other. Focusing on conatus and essence might enable us to take the\nlatter, properly ethical and psychological half of the Ethics\nat face value, but only at the cost of being debarred from seeing how\nit fits with the mechanical view of the physical world, and those\nfield metaphysical refinements of it that form the basis of modern\nphysics. Focusing on the idea of wholly extrinsic modal determinism,\nwe will see Spinoza as a visionary thinker whose physical theory both\nanticipates and provides a metaphysical basis for contemporary\nphysical views, albeit without their central experimental and perhaps\nquantitative dimensions; but then the ethical and psychological half\nof Spinoza's thought, depending as it does on the idea that\nindividuals, including bodies, are centers of active striving, proper\nto themselves, is cut adrift. Or we might take each aspect seriously\nfor what they are worth in their own domains, seeing Spinoza as both a\nvisionary thinker about the physical and a subtle and original\ntheorist of the psychological, but one whose doctrines cannot be\nsquared with each other, or with the sort of naturalism that sees the\nacting subject as fitting seamlessly into physical nature. But in any\nof these cases, we lose the unity of Spinoza's thought, which was\nclearly of vital importance to him.\n\nIn retrospect, Spinoza's view of physical nature appears as an\nunstable hybrid, perhaps even incoherent. But it of great interest as\na testimony to the striking originality of its author and to the\nunsettled state of play in the open field that was mid-17th\ncentury natural philosophy.\n",
