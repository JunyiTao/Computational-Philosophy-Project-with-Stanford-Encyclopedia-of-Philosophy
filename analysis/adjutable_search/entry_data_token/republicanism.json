In the first sense, republicanism refers to a\nloose tradition or family of writers in the history of western\npolitical thought, including especially: Machiavelli and his\nfifteenth-century Italian predecessors; the English republicans\nMilton, Harrington, Sidney, and others; Montesquieu and Blackstone;\nthe eighteenth-century English commonwealthmen; and many Americans of\nthe founding era such as Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. The writers in\nthis tradition emphasize many common ideas and concerns, such as the\nimportance of civic virtue and political participation, the dangers of\ncorruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and the rule of law,\netc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw\nheavily on classical examples\u2014from Cicero and the Latin\nhistorians especially\u2014in presenting their arguments. In light of\nthe last point, this is sometimes referred to as the \u2018classical\nrepublican\u2019 or \u2018neo-roman\u2019 tradition in political\nthought.\n\nBeyond this brief sketch, there exists considerable historiographical\ncontroversy\u2014with respect to who the tradition\u2019s members\nare, and their relative significance; with respect to how we should\ninterpret its underlying philosophical commitments; and with respect\nto its role (especially vis-\u00e0-vis liberalism) in the historical\ndevelopment of modern political thought. This brings us to the second\nsense of the term \u2018republicanism\u2019. In contemporary\npolitical theory and philosophy, it most often refers to a specific\n(and still contested) interpretation of the classical republican\ntradition, associated especially with the work of Quentin Skinner;\ntogether with a research program dedicated to developing insights from\nthis tradition into an attractive contemporary political doctrine,\nassociated especially with the work of Philip Pettit. According to\nrepublicans in this second sense (sometimes called \u2018civic\nrepublicans\u2019 or \u2018neo-republicans\u2019), the paramount\nrepublican value is political liberty, understood as non-domination or\nindependence from arbitrary power. This entry will primarily discuss\nrepublicanism in this second sense.\n\nIn their interpretation of the classical republicanism tradition,\ncivic republicans are often in debate with civic humanists, with whom\nthey are often confused (see the entry on\n civic humanism).\n Developed as a contemporary political doctrine, civic republicanism\nis broadly speaking progressive and liberal, but not without important\ndistinctive features. Some of its policy implications diverge from\nmainstream liberalism in particular ways, and for this reason civic\nrepublicans are sometimes also confused with communitarians (see the\nentry on\n communitarianism).\n For the strengths or weakness of civic republicanism to be fairly\nassessed, both confusions should be assiduously avoided.\n", "toc": [{"#PolLibNonDom": "1.

Political Liberty as Non-Domination\n\nAbsolutely central to the contemporary civic republican program is the\nconception of political liberty as non-domination or independence from\narbitrary power, and so it makes good sense to begin with an\nexplication of this idea.\n1.1 Political Liberty, Positive and Negative\n\nIt is notorious that there are several competing conceptions of\npolitical liberty. The now standard account was laid down most\ninfluentially by Isaiah Berlin in his famous lecture on \u201cTwo\nConcepts of Liberty\u201d (Berlin 1969). According to the first,\n\u2018negative\u2019 conception of liberty, people are free simply\nto the extent that their choices are not interfered with. There are\nmany variations on this conception, depending on how exactly one wants\nto define \u2018interference\u2019, but they all have in common the\nbasic intuition that to be free is, more or less, to be left alone to\ndo whatever one chooses. This idea of negative liberty Berlin\nassociates especially with the classic English political philosophers\nHobbes, Bentham, and J. S. Mill, and it is today probably the dominant\nconception of liberty, particularly among contemporary Anglo-American\nphilosophers. In Mill\u2019s well-known words, \u201cthe only\nfreedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in\nour own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of\ntheirs\u201d (1859, 17).\n\nThe second, \u2018positive\u2019 conception of liberty is not quite\nso easy to define. Roughly speaking, a person or group is free in the\npositive sense to the extent that they exercise self-control or\nself-mastery. It is not agreed, however, what exactly constitutes this\nself-mastery in the relevant sense. According to one influential\naccount, to be free in the positive sense is to be able to act on\none\u2019s second-order desires (Frankfurt 1982). For example, the\naddicted gambler may be free in the negative sense not to\ngamble\u2014since no one actually forces him to do so\u2014, but he\nis not free in the positive sense unless he actually succeeds in\nacting on his presumed second-order desire not to desire gambling.\nBerlin associates this second conception especially with such\ncontinental philosophers as Spinoza, Rousseau, and Hegel. Although it\nfound some support among English Hegelians like T. H. Green, those who\nadvocate the positive conception of liberty have generally been in the\nminority, particularly among contemporary Anglo-American\nphilosophers.\n\nThe troubling implications of the positive conception of liberty are\nwell-known, and need not be rehearsed at length here. For the most\npart, these stem from the problem that freedom in the positive sense\nwould seem to license fairly extensive coercion on behalf of\nindividuals\u2019 allegedly \u2018real\u2019 interests\u2014for\nexample, coercively forcing the gambler to quit on the presumption\nthat this is, in fact, what he really wants to do even if he\ndoesn\u2019t say so. Regarding this danger, Berlin writes:\n\nIt is one thing to say that I may be coerced for my own good which I\nam too blind to see: this may, on occasion, be for my benefit\n\u2026. [But] it is another to say that if it is my good, then I am\nnot being coerced, for I have willed it, whether I know this or not,\nand am free (or \u2018truly\u2019 free) even when my poor earthly\nbody and foolish mind bitterly reject it, and struggle against those\nwho seek however benevolently to impose it \u2026. (1969, 134)\n\n\nLiberals like Berlin have thus understandably rejected the\npositive\u00a0and embraced the negative conception of liberty. The\nquestion remains, however, whether the received view of negative\nliberty as non-interference in particular adequately captures the\npolitical ideal we should be most interested in. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans argue that it does not.\n1.2 Liberty as Non-Domination\n\nBy way of illustration, consider the following scenarios (both are\nstandard examples in the republican tradition). In the first, imagine\na group of slaves with a generally well-meaning master. While the\nlatter has an institutionally-protected right to treat his slaves more\nor less as he pleases (he might start whipping them just for the heck\nof it, say), let us suppose that this master in particular leaves his\nslaves for the most part alone. Now to the extent that he does not in\nfact interfere with his slaves on a day-to-day basis, we are committed\nto saying\u2014on the non-interference view of liberty\u2014that\nthey enjoy some measure of freedom. Some find this conclusion deeply\ncounterintuitive: if there is anything to the idea of political\nliberty, one might think, surely it cannot be found in the condition\nof slavery!\n\nEven if we are willing to accept this conclusion, the non-interference\nview of liberty commits us to others that are perhaps even more\nparadoxical. For one thing, notice that we are committed to saying\nthat the slaves of our well-meaning master enjoy greater\nfreedom than the slaves of an abusive master down the road. Of course,\nthe former slaves are better off in some respect than the latter, but\ndo we really want to say that they are more free? For\nanother, consider the slave who, over time, comes to understand his\nmaster\u2019s psychological dispositions better and better. Taking\nadvantage of this improved insight, he manages to keep on his\nmaster\u2019s good side, and is consequently interfered with less and\nless. Thus, on the non-interference view of liberty, we are committed\nto saying that his freedom is increasing over time. Again, while it is\nclear that the slave\u2019s greater psychological insight improves\nhis well-being in some respect, do we really want to say that it\nincreases his freedom specifically?\n\nNow consider a second scenario. Imagine the colony of a great imperial\npower. Suppose that the colonial subjects have no political rights,\nand thus that the imperial power governs them unilaterally. But\nfurther suppose that the imperial power, for one reason or another,\nchooses not to exercise the full measure of its authority\u2014that\nits policy towards the colony is one of more or less benign neglect.\nFrom the point of view of liberty as non-interference, we must\nconclude that the colonial subjects enjoy considerable freedom with\nrespect to their government for, on a day-to-day basis, their\ngovernment hardly ever interferes with them. Next suppose that the\ncolonial subjects revolt with success, and achieve political\nindependence. The former colony is now self-governing. We may imagine,\nhowever, that the new government is somewhat more active than its\nimperial predecessor, passing laws and instituting policies that\ninterfere with people\u2019s lives to a greater extent than formerly\nwas the case. On the view of liberty as non-interference, we must\ntherefore say that there has been a decline in freedom with\nindependence. As in the first scenario, many find this\ncounterintuitive. Surely, a nation that has secured its independence\nfrom colonial rule must have increased its political\nliberty.\n\nWhat these examples are driving at is that political liberty might\nbest be understood as a sort of structural relationship that exists\nbetween persons or groups, rather than as a contingent pattern on\noutcomes. Whether a master chooses to whip his slave on any given day,\nwe might say, is a contingent outcome: it all depends on the\nmaster\u2019s mood, the slave\u2019s behavior, and so forth. What is\nnot contingent (or at least not in the same way) is the broader\nconfiguration of laws, institutions, and norms that effectively permit\nmasters to treat their slaves however they please. As the ex-slave\nFrederick Douglass said of his former condition, \u201cit was\nslavery\u2014not its mere incidents\u2014that I hated\u201d (1855,\n161).\n\nThe republican conception of political liberty aims to capture this\ninsight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of\nstructural independence\u2014as the condition of not being subject to\nthe arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master. Pettit, who has done\nmore than anyone else to develop this republican conception of freedom\nphilosophically, puts it thus: a person or group enjoys freedom to the\nextent that no other person or group has \u201cthe capacity to\ninterfere in their affairs on an arbitrary basis\u201d (1999, 165;\ncf. Pettit\u00a01997, 2001, 2012, 2014). On a plausible rendering of\nthe term \u2018domination\u2019 as, roughly speaking, arbitrary or\nuncontrolled power (see Wartenberg 1990; Pettit\u00a01997, 2012;\nLovett\u00a02010, 2018), we might equivalently say that freedom in the\nrepublican sense consists in the secure enjoyment of non-domination.\nThis view has since been widely embraced by republican-minded authors\nsuch as Skinner (1998, 2002, 2008), Viroli (2002), Maynor (2003,\n2015), Laborde (2008, 2010), Costa (2009, 2013, 2016), Honohan (2013,\n2014), Taylor (2017), and O\u2019Shea (2019).\n1.3 Republican versus Negative Liberty\n\nNotice that the republican view of freedom is, at least in the broad\nsense, a negative conception of political liberty. One need not do or\nbecome anything in particular to enjoy political liberty in the\nrepublican sense; one need not exercise self-mastery, on any view of\nwhat that entails, nor succeed in acting on one\u2019s second-order\ndesires (Skinner 1984, 1991, 2002; Spitz 1993). Republican freedom\nmerely requires the absence of something, namely, the absence of any\nstructural dependence on arbitrary power or domination. (Also like\nnon-interference, non-domination comes in degrees: on the civic\nrepublican view, one is not either free or unfree, but rather more or\nless free depending on the extent of non-domination one securely\nenjoys.)\n\nDespite these similarities, however, republican freedom is not\nequivalent to the received view of negative liberty as\nnon-interference. In contrast to the non-interference view, it easily\naccounts for our intuitions in the two scenarios described above. The\nslave lacks freedom because he is vulnerable to the arbitrary power of\nhis master; whether his master happens to exercise that power is\nneither here nor there. Likewise, what matters with respect to\npolitical freedom on the republican view is not how much the\nimperial power chooses to govern its colony, but the fact that the\nformer may choose to govern the latter as much and however it likes.\nThus Joseph Priestley described the lightly-governed American colonies\nas nevertheless in a condition of servitude because \u201cby the same\npower, by which the people of England can compel them to pay one\npenny, they may compel them to pay the last penny they have\u201d\n(1769, 140).\n\nMoreover, the republican conception captures in a more intuitively\nsatisfying way what would improve either situation with\nrespect to political liberty. Most people are not inclined to say that\nslaves enjoy increasing freedom just because, with experience, they\nimprove their insight into their master\u2019s psychological\ndispositions. But many would be inclined to say that their\nfreedom is enhanced, other things being equal, if some effective\nreform in the laws, institutions, or norms sharply reduced their\nmaster\u2019s authority over them. (This is not necessarily to say\nthat the slaves will enjoy greater well-being, all things\nconsidered\u2014only that because their domination is lessened, they\nenjoy greater freedom to that extent.) And of course, no matter how\nbenevolent their particular master happens to be, no slave can be\ncompletely free until the institution of slavery itself is\nabolished.\n\nPolitical freedom, in other words, is constituted by rightly-ordered\nlaws, institutions, and norms: \u201cto enjoy such non-domination,\nafter all, is just to be in a position where no one can interfere\narbitrarily in your affairs,\u201d writes Pettit, \u201cand you are\nin that position from the moment that the institutions are in\nplace\u201d inhibiting possible arbitrary interference (1997, 107).\nPolitical freedom is most fully realized, on this view, in a\nwell-ordered self-governing republic of equal citizens under the rule\nof law, where no one citizen is the master of any other (Pettit 1989,\n1997, 2012, 2014; Skinner 1991, 1998; Spitz 1993, 1995; Viroli 2002;\nMaynor 2003; Lovett 2022). In the classic expression of James\nHarrington, such a community would be an \u201cempire of laws and not\nof men\u201d (1656, 8).\n2. Republican Liberty: Problems and Debates\n\nThe appeal of the republican conception of political liberty as\nindependence from the arbitrary power of a master is perhaps\nunderstandable. This is not to say, however, that this conception is\nuncontroversial. Before discussing its role in developing contemporary\ncivic republican arguments, we should consider various problems and\ndebates surrounding the republican idea of freedom.\n2.1 What about non-interference?\n\nA common objection to the republican idea of freedom is that it fails\nto pick out an distinct conception at all. The suggestion here, first\nnoted perhaps by Paley (1785), is that talking about non-domination is\nreally just another (more obscure) way of talking about security of\nnon-interference (Goodin 2003; Carter 2008; Kramer 2008). Contemporary\ncivic republicans must reject this view. Pettit (1997, 73\u20134)\nobserves that one might secure a low expected level of\nnon-interference in more than one way, and the republican idea of\nfreedom is by no means indifferent as to the method adopted. For\nexample, to have a master with an exceptionally benevolent disposition\nis to be reasonably secure in one\u2019s expectation that one will\nnot often be adversely interfered with\u2014but it is to have a\nmaster nonetheless. The republican idea of freedom specifically\ninstructs us not to make our master a better person (the goal of the\nold \u2018mirror for princes\u2019 literature), but to render him\nless of a master (Lovett 2012b). This can only be done by curbing\neither his arbitrary power or his subjects\u2019 dependency on\nhim.\n\nSupposing then that non-domination and non-interference are indeed\ndistinct ideas, one might wonder where this leaves the latter, on the\ncivic republican view of things. Is obtaining freedom from arbitrary\npower the only thing we should care about? Roughly speaking,\nthere are three possible answers civic republicans might give to this\nquestion.\n\nThe first is simply to answer yes. It was a mistake, one\nmight argue, to ever think non-interference important or desirable in\nitself. Of course, as a contingent empirical fact, extensive arbitrary\npower often brings extensive interferences in train (slave masters and\nabsolute monarchs just can\u2019t help meddling in their\nsubjects\u2019 affairs, we might suppose), so it is understandable\nthat our distaste for the former should influence our assessment of\nthe latter. There are good reasons for rejecting this first answer,\nhowever. Imagine living in a community where our lives are regulated\ndown to the tiniest detail, but always in strict accordance with\ncommonly-known, non-arbitrary rules and procedures. Although we enjoy\nextensive freedom from arbitrary power, we have hardly any freedom of\nindividual choice. Most would not want to live in such a community,\nand this suggests that we do indeed place some independent value on\nnon-interference (Larmore 2001; Wall 2001).\n\nThis leaves two other possible answers. On the one hand, we might try\nto incorporate some measure of non-interference into our idea of\nfreedom as non-domination. Something like this approach was initially\ntaken by Pettit (1997, 74\u20137): there he distinguished between\nfactors that \u201ccompromise\u201d liberty, and factors that\n\u201ccondition\u201d it. Perhaps my republican freedom is\ncompromised when someone gains arbitrary power over me, but it is\nmerely conditioned when I lack the means or opportunities to make full\nuse of it, and interferences might be one such conditioning factor. On\nthe other hand, we might allow that republican freedom and\nnon-interference are distinct goods, but hold that both are valuable\nin some degree. We might either regard them as having roughly equal\nvalue (Skinner 1998), or we might regard republican liberty as having\ngreater importance than non-interference, other things equal (Viroli\n2002, Pettit 2012). Each of these options has its advantages and\ndisadvantages, and there is no settled view in the contemporary civic\nrepublican literature on this point (see Lovett 2018).\u00a0\n2.2 What Counts as \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 Power?\n\nA second major difficulty in developing the republican idea of freedom\nlies in giving precise meaning to the notion of arbitrariness.\nAccording to what criteria are we to consider power\n\u2018arbitrary\u2019? Not simply when its exercise is random or\nunpredictable. This view would undermine the whole point of the\nrepublican conception of political liberty. As discussed above, with\nlong experience a slave is better able to predict his master\u2019s\nbehavior, and so it appears less random to him, but (the civic\nrepublican wants to argue) the slave does not enjoy greater freedom by\nthat fact alone. Just because one is better able to cope with\narbitrary power, it does not follow that one\u2019s domination is any\nless.\n\n\u2018Discretionary\u2019 is much closer to the relevant meaning of\narbitrary, but it is not quite right either. Discretionary power might\nbe delegated to a public agency with a view to advancing certain\npolicy goals or ends\u2014as for example Congress has delegated\ndiscretionary authority to the Federal Reserve\u2014but we would not\nwant to say that this reduces our freedom (or, at any rate, not so\nlong as that discretionary authority is appropriately answerable to a\ncommon knowledge understanding of the goals or ends it is meant to\nserve and the means it is permitted to employ). For reasons explained\nin the fourth section of this entry, contemporary civic republicans\nmust be able to offer an account of non-arbitrary, yet discretionary\nauthority.\n\nHow then should we characterize arbitrary power? Broadly speaking, two\nanswers have been proposed. The first defines non-arbitrariness\nprocedurally. Power is not arbitrary, on this view, to the extent that\nit is reliably controlled by effective rules, procedures, or goals\nthat are common knowledge to all persons or groups concerned\n(Lovett\u00a02010, 2022). To be reliable and effective, on this view,\nconstraints must be resilient over a wide range of possible changes or\nmodifications in the relevant circumstances. Roughly speaking, the\nprocedural view equates republican freedom with the traditional idea\nof the rule of law, provided we are willing to extend the latter idea\nconsiderably (List 2006; Lovett 2016a).\n\nAlternatively, we might define non-arbitrariness democratically. Power\nis not arbitrary, on this second view, to the extent that it is\ndirectly or indirectly controlled by the concerned persons or groups\nthemselves. In an example offered by Pettit (2012, 57\u201358),\nsuppose Andrea has given Bob the keys to her alcohol cupboard, with\nstrict instructions that no matter how much she pleads, he is not to\nreturn them except on twenty-four hours notice. Since Bob must answer\nto Andrea for his conduct in this regard, his power over her is not\narbitrary. In roughly the same way, the power of the state over its\ncitizens will not be arbitrary provided the people have an equal share\nin controlling how their state exercises its power. Many authors\nsubscribe to some version of this democratic view (see for example\nBohman 2008; Laborde 2008; Forst 2013; McCammon 2015).\n\nEither way, two caveats are worth noting. The first is that, on either\nview, arbitrariness simply means uncontrolled and vice versa.\nPettit\u2019s recent preference for the latter term over the former\n(e.g., Pettit 2012, 2014) is simply due to its superior clarity, and\nrepresents neither a real change in view nor the addition of a new\ncondition alongside the old. The second caveat is that, again on\neither view, arbitrary or uncontrolled power should not be defined\nalong substantive lines as power that is unjust or illegitimate. This\nwas never Pettit\u2019s view, though in earlier work (e.g., Pettit\n1997) some passages may have inadvertently suggested otherwise. The\nwell-known problem with a moralized definition of arbitrariness is\nthat it would collapse our conception of republican freedom into a\ngeneral account of the human good (Larmore 2001; Costa 2007; Carter\n2008).\n2.3 Republican Freedom and the Human Good\n\nSo far we have assumed that, however ultimately defined, republican\nfreedom is always a good thing. Some have wondered whether this is the\ncase, however. This objection is most often expressed via the example\nof benevolent care-giving relationships. On the republican view that\none enjoys freedom only to the extent that one is independent from\narbitrary power, it would seem that children do not enjoy republican\nfreedom with respect to their parents. But surely, one might suppose,\nthe parent-child relationship is (in most cases) an extremely valuable\none, and so we would not want greater republican freedom in such a\ncontext. Republican freedom is, perhaps, not always a good thing\n(Ferejohn 2001).\n\nAs stated, this objection rests on a conceptual error, though (as we\nshall see) it points to an important set of issues as yet\nunder-developed in the contemporary civic republican literature. The\nerror in the above example stems from our confusing the overall\nevaluation of a whole with an evaluation of its parts considered\nseparately. It is undeniable that, at least in the ordinary course of\nthings, parent-child relationships are extremely valuable, considered\nas a whole; it does not follow from this, however, that the\nrelationship is necessarily valuable in each and every part. For the\nobjection to hold, it must be the case\u2014not only that the\nparent-child relationship is valuable overall\u2014but further, that\nthat it would actually be worse if, holding all its other features\nconstant, it involved less arbitrary power. But this is highly\ndoubtful. Clearly, the introduction of children\u2019s rights into\nwestern law was a boon, precisely because it reduced the degree of\narbitrary power to which children are inevitably subject (which is to\nsay, because it increased their republican freedom). That their\nrepublican freedom cannot be increased still further, perhaps, without\ndestroying family life altogether, and thus losing its many other\nbenefits, is neither here nor there.\n\nWhat consideration of this faulty objection does reveal, however, is\nthat republican freedom is simply one good among others, with which it\nmight come into conflict (Markell 2008). The challenge for\ncontemporary civic republicans, therefore, is less to show why\nnon-domination is an important human good (for which there are plenty\nof good arguments in the literature: see Pettit 1997; Maynor 2003;\nLaborde 2008; G\u00e4deke 2020), but rather to show how it fits into a\nbroader moral framework, and specifically, the comparative weight we\nshould assign to republican freedom vis-\u00e0-vis other important\ngoods in the achievement of human flourishing (or, if non-domination\nis regarded as a deontological side-constraint, as suggested by Forst\n2013, its relative priority vis-\u00e0-vis other side-constraints).\nPettit (2005, 2014) sketches a case for the relative priority of\nrepublican liberty on more or less pragmatic grounds: roughly\nspeaking, he argues that political doctrines will be most effective\nwhen they concentrate on as few core values as possible, and\naccordingly that the best values to concentrate on are those whose\npromotion will service as wide a range of needs as possible.\nRepublican freedom is just such a good, he claims, insofar as our\nefforts to promote it will necessarily have far-reaching beneficial\nconsequences. It will be more clear why this might be so in light of\nthe discussion in part four below, but regardless there remains\nconsiderable work to be done developing the foundations of republican\ntheory.\n3. The Classical Republican Tradition\n\nAfter long-standing neglect among historians of political thought,\nthere has been a dramatic revival of interest in the classical\nrepublican tradition in the past fifty years or so. For the first few\ndecades of this revival, a particular interpretation of that tradition\nprevailed. According to this view, the classical republicans held what\nwould now be described as a perfectionist political\nphilosophy\u2014that is, a political philosophy centered on the idea\nof promoting a specific conception of the good life as consisting in\nactive citizenship and healthy civic virtue on the one hand, while\ncombating any sort of corruption that would undermine these values on\nthe other. This distinctive vision of the good life is supposed to be\nrooted in the experience of the ancient Greek polis, especially as\nexpressed in the writings of Aristotle. The goods of active political\nparticipation, civic virtue, and so on, are to be understood as\nintrinsically valuable components of human flourishing.\n\nIt is now standard to refer to this as the \u2018civic\nhumanist\u2019 interpretation of the classical republican tradition,\nand it is most commonly associated with the writings of Arendt (1958,\n1963), Pocock (1975, 1981), and Rahe (1992). These and other civic\nhumanist writings have left such an impression on the field that even\ntoday many fail to distinguish their views from those of the civic\nrepublicans. As we shall see, however, the two are importantly\ndistinct.\n3.1 The Instrumental Turn\n\nBeginning with Skinner (1984), Sunstein (1988), and Pettit (1989), an\nalternative interpretation of the tradition began to emerge.\nUndoubtedly, the classical republicans were committed to the\nimportance of active political participation, civic virtue, combating\ncorruption, and so forth. But rather than viewing these as\nintrinsically valuable components of a particular vision of the good\nlife, these authors argued, they should instead be viewed as\ninstrumentally useful tools for securing and preserving\npolitical liberty, understood as independence from arbitrary rule.\nRepublicanism, on this view, has its roots not in an Aristotelian\nvision of the ancient Greek polis, but rather in Roman jurisprudence\nwith its fundamental and categorical distinction between free men and\ncitizens on the one hand, and dependent slaves on the other. This\ninstrumental or \u2018neo-Roman\u2019 interpretation of the\ntradition was cemented in major contributions by Spitz (1995), Pettit\n(1997), Dagger (1997), and Skinner (1998).\n\nThere now exists a considerable historiographical literature advancing\nthis new interpretation, including studies of Machiavelli (Skinner\n1983, 1984; Viroli 1998), the seventeenth-century English republicans\n(Dzelzainis 1995; Skinner 1998, 2000; Lovett 2005, 2012a, 2020);\nRousseau (Viroli 1998); many Americans of the founding era (Sellers\n1994); Wollstonecraft (Coffee 2012; Halldenius 2015); some of the\nFrench revolutionaries (Hammersley (2010);\u00a0and the\nnineteenth-century American labor republicans (Gourevitch 2015). These\nand other contemporary civic republicans argue that a careful reading\nof the classical republican texts firmly rejects the perfectionist\ninterpretation favored by civic humanists.\n\nMoreover, the instrumental turn was vital to establishing interest in\nrepublicanism as a viable contemporary political doctrine. The\ndifficulty with civic humanism, as many critics have pointed out, is\nthat a perfectionist vision of human flourishing through active\npolitical virtue is out of step with modern political and social\nconditions. There is simply no hope for\u00a0recreating the experience\nof the Greek polis in economically complex mass democracies\ncharacterized by reasonable pluralism (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003;\nBrennan and Lomasky 2006). This objection is removed, however, if we\nregard civic virtue instrumentally, as merely one tool among others\nfor securing political liberty. Insofar as republicans are willing to\nuse that tool, and thus willing to support public policies designed to\ndeliberately cultivate civic virtue, they must perhaps reject stronger\ndoctrines of liberal neutrality; but they will nevertheless be happy\nto endorse broad principles of toleration (Honohan 2013; Lovett and\nWhitfield 2016). Thus properly understood, republicanism is fully\n\u201ccompatible with modern pluralistic forms of society\u201d\n(Pettit 1997, 8).\n3.2 Republicanism and Liberalism\n\nThe contemporary civic republican interpretation carries with it what\ncould be seen as a significant drawback, namely, that it reduces the\ndistance between classical republicanism and the mainstream liberal\ntradition. At one level, this should surprise no one. After all,\nclassical republicans and classical liberals shared many political\ncommitments (constitutionalism and the rule of law, for example), and\nmany figures are regarded as central to both traditions (Montesquieu,\nfor example). The difficulty arises, however, from the suggestion that\non the new instrumental interpretation, republicanism for all intents\nand purposes collapses into liberalism (Patten 1996; Larmore 2001).\nIndeed, at one point in his Political Liberalism, Rawls\nexplicitly states that his theory has \u201cno fundamental\nopposition\u201d with a non-perfectionist, instrumental\ninterpretation of republicanism (1993, 205). What then is the\nadvantage of civic republicanism over mainstream liberalism (Herzog\n1986; Goodin 2003; Brennan and Lomasky 2006)?\n\nThe standard reply among contemporary civic republicans is to argue\nthat there is indeed a connection between republicanism and\nliberalism, but that liberalism is \u201can impoverished or\nincoherent republicanism\u201d (Viroli 2002, 61)\u2014a bastard\noffshoot, so to speak, of what was originally a considerably more\nappealing political philosophy. The republican critique of liberalism\nis thus best understood as a critique of various problematic\ntendencies that developed within the liberal tradition as it\nincreasingly diverged from its republican roots.\n\nThe most important of these is the tendency in the liberal tradition,\nespecially beginning with Bentham, Paley, and Constant, to displace\nthe robust conception of liberty as independence from arbitrary or\nuncontrolled power with a weaker conception of liberty as\nnon-interference. The significance of this substitution will be easier\nto assess after the discussion below, but in the main it comes down to\nthis: because republican liberty is inherently incompatible with any\nform of dependency or mastery, its social implications are\nconsiderably more radical than those of mere negative liberty. This is\nprecisely why many liberal authors took pains to distance themselves\nfrom republicanism in the first place, as they openly admitted:\n\u201cthose definitions of liberty ought to be rejected, which, by\nmaking that essential to civil freedom which is unattainable in\nexperience, inflame expectations that can never be gratified,\u201d\nobserved Paley (1785, 315; cf. Pettit 1997).\n\nWhat is more, on the view of liberty as non-interference, any sort of\npublic law or policy intervention will count as an interference and,\nergo, as a reduction in freedom. Liberals committed to the received\nview of negative liberty will thus tend to be overly hostile to\ngovernment action (Pettit 1997, 2009). On the republican view, by\ncontrast, public laws or policy interventions need not always count as\nreductions in freedom. Provided the law or policy is adopted and\nimplemented in an appropriately non-arbitrary manner, the\ncitizens\u2019 freedom remains untouched. Indeed, if the law or\npolicy ameliorates dependency, or curtails the arbitrary powers some\nin the community exercise over others, freedom may be enhanced. In the\nclassical tradition, this idea was often expressed as the claim that,\nin the words of Blackstone, \u201claws, when prudently framed, are by\nno means subversive but rather introductive of liberty\u201d and thus\n\u201cwhere there is no law, there is no freedom\u201d (1765, 122).\nThe grounds for this claim will be explained further below.\n4. The Contemporary Republican Program\n\nHowever interesting the debates discussed in the previous section, one\nmay still wonder whether republicanism has anything valuable to\ncontribute to contemporary normative political theory and philosophy.\nOne reason many people remain skeptical has to do with the fact that\nthe classical republican writings often express views that are\ndecidedly elitist, patriarchal, and militaristic. How could the basis\nfor an appealing contemporary political program be found in such\nwritings (Goldsmith 2000; Maddox 2002; Goodin 2003; McCormick\n2003)?\n\nThat the classical republicans often expressed these very unappealing\nviews is not disputed. But what are we to make of this fact? There are\ntwo possibilities. On the one hand, the parochialism of the classical\nrepublicans might reflect logical consequences of their core value\ncommitments, in which case we cannot adopt the latter without taking\non board the former. On the other hand, it might merely reflect the\naccidental prejudices of their day, in which case it can easily be\ndispensed with as we modernize the republican program. Now according\nto the civic humanist reading of the tradition, the classical\nrepublicans were committed to a perfectionist conception of the human\ngood as active citizenship and civic virtue. On this view, it is clear\nthat some individuals will be more successful than others in attaining\nthe good so understood\u2014some are more adept at politics than\nothers, some are more capable of heroic displays of virtue than\nothers, and so on. Indeed, political power and public honor are, to\nsome extent, positional goods, meaning that their distribution among\nthe members of a community will necessarily be unequal. It follows\nthat, on the civic humanist reading of the tradition, the elitist bent\nof the classical republican writings is a consequence of their core\nvalues. As Arendt writes, it is \u201cthe sign of a well-ordered\nrepublic\u201d that only the politically virtuous elite \u201cwould\nhave the right to be heard in the conduct of the business of the\nrepublic\u201d (1963, 279).\n\nThe civic republicans, naturally, reject this view. There is nothing\ninherently elitist about the ideal of freedom when this is understood\nnegatively as independence from arbitrary or uncontrolled power. The\nclassical republicans, to be sure, typically confined the extension of\nthis ideal to a narrow range of propertied, native-born male citizens.\nBut on the civic republican reading of the tradition, this merely\nreflects an unnecessary prejudice we can easily dispense with. The\nelitism of the tradition long concealed the potentially radical\nimplications of freedom as non-domination; suitably universalized now\nat last, republicanism is revealed to be a strikingly progressive\npolitical doctrine (Pettit 1997, 2014; Maynor 2003; Gourevitch\n2015).\n\nThe remainder of this section will sketch some of the wide-ranging\napplications of a universalized republicanism, dedicated to the\npromotion of freedom as non-domination. Much of the contemporary\nrepublican program, as one would expect, bears some familial\nrelationship with the political commitments of the classical\nrepublicans. There are also divergences, however. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans draw inspiration from the classical tradition, but they do\nnot aim to anachronistically implement the republicanism of yore for\nits own sake.\n4.1 Republican Public Policy\n\nContemporary civic republicans aim to promote freedom, understood as\nindependence from arbitrary power. Roughly speaking, there are two\ndirections from which republican freedom might be threatened. First,\nthere is the obvious danger of an autocratic or despotic government\nassuming arbitrary powers over its subjects; this concern, and\nrepublican remedies for it, will be discussed below. But there is a\nsecond danger to republican freedom as well\u2014one that concerns\ncontemporary civic republicans just as much as the first. This is the\ndanger that some individuals or groups within civil society will\nsucceed in assuming arbitrary or uncontrolled powers over others.\nAbsent this second concern, republican policy would indeed often seem\n\u201cindeterminate,\u201d as observed by McMahon (2005)\u00a0and\nCosta (2007).\u00a0A few examples will help clarify this second\ndanger.\n\nImagine for a moment there were no system of domestic criminal and\ncivil law. In this case, citizens would not know where they stood with\none another; their interrelations would be governed simply by\nforce\u2014which is to say, by the arbitrary whim of the momentarily\nstronger party. In order to enjoy some degree of republican freedom,\ntherefore, it is absolutely essential to introduce a domestic legal\nsystem so as to govern the citizens\u2019 mutual relations (Lovett\n2016a). Notice that, on the republican view of freedom, the laws do\nnot merely protect some freedoms at the expense of others (as on the\nnon-interference view), but rather themselves actually introduce or\nenable that freedom. On this view, only when their interrelations are\nmutually governed by a system of public and stable rules is it\npossible for fellow citizens to enjoy some measure of independence\nfrom arbitrary rule (Pettit 1989, 1997, 2012; Spitz 1995; Viroli 2002;\nDagger 2009).\n\nThis connection between the rule of law and freedom is a common theme\nin the classical republican literature. Contemporary civic republicans\nobserve, however, that even when the rule of law is firmly\nestablished, there remain many other potential dangers of which the\nclassical republicans were less well aware. For example, while markets\nas such need not involve domination (Pettit 2006), and indeed when\nwell-ordered might reduce it (Taylor 2017), republicans\u2019\nenthusiasm for markets will have definite limits. Specifically, there\nis the danger of basic needs deprivation, which can place the least\nadvantaged members of society in a position of economic vulnerability\n(Spitz 1993; Pettit 1997; Viroli 2002). In order to satisfy their\nbasic needs, individuals may well submit themselves to the arbitrary\npower of exploitative employers or become dependent on the whims of\nvoluntary charity (Dagger 2006; Gourevitch 2015; O\u2019Shea 2019).\nEnsuring the enjoyment of republican freedom will therefore require\nsome public provision for otherwise unmet basic needs.\n\nYet another danger to republican freedom arises in the context of\nfamily life and gender relations. Traditional family law subjected\nboth wives and children to considerable arbitrary power: circumstances\nin the case of the latter, circumscribed opportunities in the case of\nthe former, ensured the nearly complete dependency of both on the\nfamily they happened to be in. The contemporary civic republican\nprogram is thus congenial to both an expansion of children\u2019s\nrights, and the elimination of sex domination (Pettit 1997; Phillips\n2000; Costa 2013; Halldenius 2015).\n\nIt is always important from a civic republican point of view to be on\nguard against the introduction of new forms of dependency and\narbitrary power through those very laws and policies designed to\nenhance individual freedom, however. In the area of criminal and civil\nlaw, for example, freedom might be threatened by legal uncertainty or\nprosecutorial discretion; and, of course, there are grave republican\nconcerns with respect to the existing system of punishment in many\nwestern nations (Braithwaite and Pettit 1990). These dangers might\nsuggest the need for a more democratized system of criminal justice\n(Mart\u00ed 2009). Similarly, in the public provision of basic\nneeds, there are republican concerns with respect to dependence on\ngovernment aid and arbitrariness in the distribution of benefits that\nmight point to the introduction of an unconditional basic income\n(Raventos 2007; Lovett 2010; for a contrary view, see Taylor 2017). In\nmany of these areas, however, there remains considerable work for\ncontemporary civic republicans in determining the appropriate public\npolicy implications of a universalized concern for republican\nfreedom.\n4.2 Republican Political Institutions\n\nTurning from questions of public policy to the form of government, we\nreturn to issues more familiar to the writers in the classical\ntradition. Protecting citizens from the arbitrary or uncontrolled\npower of their government through good institutional design represents\nperhaps the signature classical republican concern. Many of the\nstandard devices for achieving this aim\u2014the rule of law, the\nseparation of powers, federalism, constitutionally entrenched basic\nrights, and so on\u2014have been adopted by liberals and others.\nContemporary civic republicans, naturally, remain committed to these\ninstitutional devices in some measure (Pettit 1997, 2012, 2014; Maynor\n2003).\n\nHowever, contemporary civic republicans also recognize that these\nsorts of devices can only go so far. The basic reason for this is\nthat, no matter how carefully designed, the operation and functioning\nof government necessarily entails considerable discretion on the part\nof public authorities (Pettit 1997; Richardson 2002). There are two\nespecially prominent instances of this. First, it is clear that no\nmatter how detailed and carefully-crafted it is, no system of explicit\nrules and regulations can possibly cover all contingencies and\ncircumstances. It follows that discretionary authority must inevitably\nbe left in the hands of courts, public agencies, and administrative\nbureaucracies. Second, even apart from this, there remains extensive\ndiscretion in the hands of legislatures to set public law and policy\nin the first place. A daily-changing system of rules is no better than\nhaving no rules at all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe standard republican remedy for this problem is enhanced democracy.\nIt must, however, be democracy of the right sort. Most contemporary\ncivic republicans reject the populist model of democracy according to\nwhich all public laws and policies must express the collective will of\nthe people in order to be considered legitimate. Instead, they\ngenerally endorse some form of \u201cqualified populism\u201d\n(Richardson 2002) or \u201ccontestatory democracy\u201d (Pettit\n1997, 1999, 2001; Maynor 2003). Roughly speaking, the idea is that\nproperly-designed democratic institutions should give citizens the\neffective opportunity to contest the decisions of their\nrepresentatives. This possibility of contestation will make government\nagents wielding discretionary authority answerable to a public\nunderstanding of the goals or ends they are meant to serve and the\nmeans they are permitted to employ. In this way, discretionary power\ncan be subject to popular control in the sense required for a secure\nenjoyment of republican liberty (Pettit 2012, 2014; Ingham 2019).\n\nNext, of course, we will want to know how popular control might\nactually be put into practice. The main challenges are commonly\naddressed under three headings, outlined by Pettit (1997,\n186\u20137). The first and most thoroughly discussed is the\nrequirement that discretionary authority be guided by the norm of\ndeliberative public reasoning. This means that the relevant\ndecision-makers (legislatures, courts, bureaucrats, etc.) must be\nrequired to present reasons for their decisions, and those reasons\nmust be subject to open public debate (see Sunstein 1988, 1993; Pettit\n1997; Richardson 2002). So, for example, legislative processes should\nbe designed so as to discourage back-room bargaining on the basis of\nsectional interests, and instead to encourage open public\ndeliberation. Similarly, bureaucratic agencies should not be allowed\nto merely issue determinations on the basis of technocratic expertise\nwithout offering reasons for their decisions that are open to public\nexamination.\n\nThe other two requirements have not received as much attention as the\nfirst, perhaps because both are relatively obvious. The second is that\nof inclusiveness. Opportunities for democratic contestation must be\nequally open to all persons and groups in the society. This\nrequirement follows naturally from a universalized concern for\nrepublican liberty, and it has implications for the design of\nrepresentative institutions, campaign financing, and so on (Pettit\n1997, 2012; Bellamy 2007). And the third requirement is that there\nexist institutionalized forums for contestation\u2014impartial\n\u2018courts of appeal,\u2019 so to speak, where citizens can raise\nobjections to public laws and policies (Pettit 1997, 1999, 2012).\nWhether these forums should include constitutional courts with strong\npowers of judicial review remains a subject of debate in the\nrepublican literature, however (Bellamy 2007; Honohan 2009; Hickey\n2019).\n4.3 Civic virtue and corruption\n\nAmong the more salient themes in the classical republican tradition\nare the importance of civic virtue and the dangers of corruption. We\nmay understand the term \u2018corruption\u2019 simply to mean the\nadvancement of personal or sectional interest at the expense of the\npublic good, and \u2018civic virtue\u2019 as its opposite\u2014that\nis, a willingness to do one\u2019s part in supporting the public\ngood. Critics of republicanism often fear that this implies extensive\nself-sacrifice and frugality, a renunciation of individuality and\nself-identification with the community (Herzog 1986; Goodin 2003;\nBrennan and Lomasky 2006). These fears are no doubt encouraged by the\ncivic humanist reading of the classical tradition along perfectionist\nlines. Civic republicans accordingly have been at pains to show the\ncontrary\u2014that civic virtue should be understood as a strictly\ninstrumental good, useful in establishing and maintaining republican\nliberty. Far from calling for the subjection of individual to\ncollective aims, they argue, republican liberty is desirable in part\nbecause it enables citizens to pursue their private aims with\nassurances of security (Skinner 1984, 1991; Spitz 1993; Dagger 1997;\nViroli 2002; Maynor 2003).\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two topics to consider under the heading\nof civic virtue. On the one hand, there is the civic virtue and danger\nof its corruption on the part of public officials; on the other, there\nis the civic virtue and danger of its corruption on the part of\ncitizens in general. With respect to the former, republicans typically\nreject the view (common in the liberal tradition) that public\nofficials are by nature corrupt, and instead regard individuals as\npotentially corruptible, but not necessarily corrupt (Pettit 1997).\nWorking from this assumption, it is strictly a pragmatic and empirical\nquestion which configurations of public laws, institutions, and norms\nare most likely to minimize the danger of corruption, and enhance the\ncivic virtue of public officials. Options here include screening\nprocedures on the selection of officials, rules and norms keeping some\npolicy options out of bounds, and both positive and negative\nsanctions. In designing such institutions, it is important not to\nassume the worst of people, for otherwise we might inadvertently\nencourage (through an evident lack of trust) the very corrupt behavior\none aims to guard against.\n\nPromoting civic virtue on the part of the citizens in general,\nhowever, is just as important from a republican point of view. There\nare a variety of possible reasons for this. For the most part, they\nstem from the observation that the widespread enjoyment of republican\nliberty is most likely to be maximized in a community where the\ncitizens are committed to that ideal, and each is willing to do his or\nher part in realizing it. For example, through collective political\naction, citizens can bring instances of domination to public\nattention; they can support laws and policies that would expand\nrepublican freedom; and they can do their part in defending republican\ninstitutions when called upon to do so. Promoting this sort of\ncommitment to republican ideals will require a fairly robust program\nof civics education, together with a culture that rewards virtue with\npublic esteem (Dagger 1997; Pettit 1997; Brennan and Pettit 2003;\nMaynor 2003; Costa 2009; Lovett 2020). Again, it should be emphasized\nhere that citizens do not enjoy republican freedom, on the civic\nrepublican view, in being virtuous. Indeed, this could not be\nthe case since, as argued earlier, the degree of republican freedom\nenjoyed is rather a question of how the laws, institutions, and norms\nof the community are ordered. Civic virtue is, however,\ninstrumentally useful both in bringing about the right sorts\nof laws, institutions, and norms, and in ensuring their durability and\nreliability.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the connection between civic virtue\n(both on the part of public officials and citizens in general) and the\nrule of law. The significance of the rule of law for republican\nliberty was discussed above; in the classical republican tradition,\nthis was expressed as the \u201cempire of law\u201d ideal\u2014the\nnotion that in a free republic laws, not men, rule. Of course this\ncannot ever be literally true, but it can be approximated in a sort of\nartificial way, so that life can be experienced as if it were\ntrue within a given community. This requires, however, that the law be\nwidely regarded as clear, predictable, and legitimate, and this in\nturn is possible only when there is a generally high level of\ncompliance and when legal rules are embedded in a shared network of\ninformal social norms (Pettit 1997; Lovett 2016a).\n4.4 Republicanism Across Borders\n\nThe classical republicans were fond of extolling the martial valor of\nRome and other ancient republics, and they often followed Machiavelli\nin advocating policies and institutions that would enhance the\nexpansionist capacities of republics. For this they have often been\naccused of militaristic and imperialistic tendencies (see for example\nGoodin 2003), but this is not entirely fair. One has to be mindful of\nthe dangerous security environments republics have often faced. The\nclassical republicans rarely advocated conquest for its own sake:\n\u201cswords were given to men,\u201d writes Sidney, \u201cthat\nnone might be slaves,\u201d not that they might enslave others (1698,\n343). In a hostile world populated by autocratic rivals, Machiavelli\nmay have been right to believe that a republic\u2019s best defence is\na good offense.\n\nEven so, the classical republicans were sensitive to the particular\ndangers of territorial expansion. They especially worried that by\nupsetting the domestic balance of wealth and power, imperial conquest\nwould undermine freedom at home, and accordingly they sought remedies\nthrough various cooperative and federal arrangements (Deudney 2007;\nBohman 2008). Whether optimally securing republican freedom under\nmodern conditions will ultimately require some sort of global\nrepublic, however, remains a topic of debate (see Pettit 2010;\nMart\u00ed 2010; Maynor 2015).\n\nBeyond narrow security concerns, however, contemporary civic\nrepublicans have recently begun to explore the implications of\nrepublican freedom for global economic justice. Supposing the ideal is\nsuitably universalized, and thus every human being\u2019s\nnon-domination counts the same, are republicans committed to\ncosmopolitan policies of global redistribution? Here a wide range of\nviews can be found in the literature. Pettit (2010, 2014) argues no,\non the grounds that economic justice is mainly important indirectly\nfor preserving domestic republican institutions, whereas Lovett\n(2016b) argues yes, on the grounds that poverty and severe inequality\ndirectly expose individuals to domination. In between these positions,\nLaborde (2010), and Laborde and Ronzoni (2016) maintain that our\nglobal obligations to promote non-domination are similar but\nultimately weaker than our domestic ones. Finally, Bachvarova (2013)\nsuggests that republicanism is best suited to address relational\nrather than distributive global justice.\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge to contemporary civic republican\ntheory, however, is the problem of state borders and global migration.\nRepublicans are in a strong position to advocate for stateless\npersons, refugees, and resident non-citizens who, in various ways, are\nclearly vulnerable to avoidable domination (Bohman 2009; Benton 2010).\nMuch less obvious, however, is how to address the issue of\ninternational freedom of movement. Traditionally committed to a strong\nconception of citizenship, the republican ideal of political liberty\nhas often seemed inseparable from the existence of bounded communities\nof fellow free citizens. Pettit (2012, 161\u20132) claims that since\nstates have no choice but to maintain borders, the existence of\nmigration controls as such cannot count as dominating, while Costa\n(2016) disagrees. Honohan (2014) insists that any migration controls a\ngiven state does implement should be non-arbitrary, but as Fine (2014)\nobserves, this does not settle the ultimate question of whether\nfreedom of movement can be reconciled with the need to maintain civic\ncommunity.\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn many respects, civic republicanism remains a still underdeveloped\npolitical doctrine. Further work is required in all the areas\ndiscussed above, and there are many issues central to the concerns of\ncontemporary political theorists and philosophers that contemporary\ncivic republicans have only recently begun to examine. Among the\nlatter, there are now at least initial treatments of multiculturalism\n(Laborde 2008; Lovett 2010; Honohan 2013; Bachvarova 2014), education\npolicy (Peterson 2011; Hinchliffe 2014; Macleod 2015), and\nintergenerational justice (Beckman 2016; Katz 2017; Pinto 2019),\nalthough substantial work certainly remains to be done. Nevertheless,\ncivic republicanism is a dynamic and growing field, which stands to\nmake continuing positive contributions to debate in contemporary\nsocial and political theory.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arendt, Hannah, 1958. <em>The Human Condition</em>, Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1963. <em>On Revolution</em>, New York:\nViking Press.", "Bachvarova, Mira, 2013. \u201cNon-domination\u2019s Role in\nTheorizing Global Justice.\u201d <em>Journal of Global Ethics</em>,\n9: 173\u201385.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014. \u201cMulticultural Accommodation\nand the Ideal of Non-domination.\u201d <em>Critical Review of\nInternational Social and Political Philosophy</em>, 17:\n652\u201373.", "Beckman, Ludvig, 2016. \u201cPower and Future People\u2019s\nFreedom: Intergenerational Domination, Climate Change, and\nConstitutionalism.\u201d <em>Journal of Political Power</em>, 9:\n289\u2013307.", "Bellamy, Richard, 2007. <em>Political Constitutionalism: A\nRepublican Defense of the Constitutionality of Democracy</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Benton, Meghan, 2014. \u201cThe Problem of Denizenship: A\nNon-domination Framework.\u201d <em>Critical Review of International\nSocial and Political Theory</em>, 17: 49\u201369.", "Berlin, Isaiah, 1969. \u201cTwo Concepts of Liberty,\u201d in\n<em>Four Essays on Liberty</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Blackstone, William, [1765] 1979. <em>Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland, Volume 1</em>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press.", "Bohman, James, 2008. \u201cNondomination and Transnational\nDemocracy,\u201d in <em>Republicanism and Political Theory</em>,\nC\u00e9cile Laborde and John Maynor (eds.), Malden, MA: Blackwell\nPublishing.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2009. \u201cCosmopolitan Republicanism and\nthe Rule of Law,\u201d in <em>Legal Republicanism: National and\nInternational Perspectives</em>, Samantha Besson and Jos\u00e9 Luis\nMart\u00ed (eds.), Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Braithwaite, John, and Philip Pettit, 1990. <em>Not Just Deserts:\nA Republican Theory of Criminal Justice</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "Brennan, Geoffrey, and Loren Lomasky, 2006. \u201cAgainst\nReviving Republicanism.\u201d <em>Politics, Philosophy, and\nEconomics</em>, 5: 221\u201352.", "Brennan, Geoffrey, and Philip Pettit, 2003. <em>The Economy of\nEsteem</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Carter, Ian, 2008. \u201cHow are Power and Unfreedom\nRelated?\u201d in <em>Republicanism and Political Theory</em>,\nC\u00e9cile Laborde and John Maynor (eds.), Malden, MA: Blackwell\nPublishing.", "Coffee, Alan M.S.J., 2012. \u201cMary Wollstonecraft, Freedom,\nand the Enduring Power of Social Domination.\u201d <em>European\nJournal of Political Theory</em>, 12: 116\u201335.", "Costa, M.
