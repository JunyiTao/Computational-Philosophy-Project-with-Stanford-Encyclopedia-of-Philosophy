    "main_text": "The Case of R\u016bm\u012b\n6. Conclusion\n\nEven though post Sadrian philosophy in the Islamic tradition never\nreached the level of accomplishment of the great masters of the\nSafavid period, Sadra\u2019s school of metaphysics found followers in\nthe periods that were to follow, both in and outside of Persia. While\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s influence was marginal in the Arab\nworld, which has generally seemed to distance itself from traditional\nmetaphysical issues, in India, \u1e62adrian philosophy was well\nreceived and it is taught in traditional schools today.\n\nWith the advent of the Q\u0101j\u0101r dynasty in Iran in the early\n18th century CE., \u1e62adrian philosophy once again\nbecame the focal point of philosophical activity. The greatest\nproponents of gnosis and philosophical mysticism in this period came\nto be known as the \u201cSchool of Tehran.\u201d This school\nincluded Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Nur\u012b (d. 1830\u20131 CE)\nwhose Glosses upon the Secrets of Verses is an esoteric\ncommentary on certain verses of the Qur\u2019an, Mull\u0101\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl Kh\u0101ju\u2018\u012b (d. 1759 CE), who\nwrote on the concept of time within a gnostic context, and the most\ncelebrated figure in this period, \u1e24\u0101jj Mull\u0101\nH\u0101d\u012b Sabziw\u0101r\u012b (1797\u20131873 CE) whose\nCommentary on Treatises (Shar\u1e25-i\nman\u1e93umah) is a compendium of philosophical gnosticism.\nSabziw\u0101r\u012b, who also wrote mystical poetry under the pen-name\nAsr\u0101r (Secrets), brought about a rapprochement\namong many different strands of mystical philosophy and considered\nasceticism to be a central part of living a philosophical life. With\nSabziw\u0101r\u012b\u2019s death in 1797 CE., Tehran became the\ncenter of philosophical activity, much of which centered around the\nphilosophy of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 and Sabziw\u0101r\u012b. The\nsalient features of the School of Tehran were that knowledge is\nhierarchical in essence and that discursive philosophy, while useful,\nis ultimately limited. In this tradition, it is through intellectual\nintuition, illumination, and inner purification that the reality of\nexistence can be experienced (Sabzav\u0101r\u012b 1969;\nAshtiy\u0101n\u012b 1973) . Among other masters of this period are\nMull\u0101 \u2018Abdall\u0101h Zunuz\u012b (d. 1841\u201342 CE), the\nauthor of Divine Flashes of Light (al-Lama\u2018\u0101t\nal-il\u0101hiyyah), and his son, Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b\nZunuz\u012b (d. 1889\u20131900 CE), who authored Marvels of\nWisdom (Bad\u0101yi\u2018 al-h\u0323ikam). Both of\ntheir works are gnostic and mystical commentaries upon a wide range of\nphilosophical problems. Because the School of Tehran was dominated by\ngrand scholars who were also jurists, it continued in the\n\u1e62adrian and Sabziw\u0101rian tradition, but distanced itself\nfrom popular Sufism, with whom they identified relaxed attitude and\neven antinomian tendencies towards Islamic law\n(Shari\u2018ah). Emphasis on piety, asceticism, and\ncleansing of the soul within the prescribed limits of the\nShari\u2018ah, perhaps partially a reaction to modernity, is\nthe salient feature of the School of Tehran.\n\nThe number of Muslim philosophers who became proponents of mystical\nphilosophy in the Islamic world are too numerous to mention here, but\nclearly mysticism is a living tradition that continues to occupy\ncenter stage in the philosophy in the Muslim world. It is virtually\nimpossible to fully account for all the traditions of mysticism in the\nIslamic philosophical tradition, however such traditions do exist in\nalmost every Muslim country today (see Kili\u00e7 1996).\n\nThe impact of mysticism on Islamic philosophy has been so profound\nthat it has changed the very essence and definition of philosophizing.\nThe enterprise of philosophizing in the Islamic tradition is seen by\nmost not merely as an intellectual exercise but as the intellectual\ndimension of the soul\u2019s spiritual journey towards the unveiling\nof truth. Authentic philosophy, according to Muslim\nphilosopher-mystics is therefore committed to providing a\nrationalistic commentary upon those issues which traditionally\nbelonged to the mystical domain only.\n",
