    "main_text": "Analyzing Morally Significant Social Issues || Climate Change and the Environment\n5.3 Climate Change and the Environment\n\nFinally, at least for our purposes, game theory has been crucial to\nthe analysis of many important problems in environmental ethics, the\nmost famous probably being the tragedy of the commons (G.\nHardin 1968) where game theory has been used to show how resources can\neasily be depleted or degraded when they are held in common and use of\nthe resource is not regulated. The idea of the tragedy of the commons\nis that when access to a scarce resource is not limited in some way\nthere is a tendency for use of the resource to exceed the\nenvironment\u2019s capacity to regenerate the resource. So, for\nexample, we overgraze land, deplete fish and game stocks, run down the\nwater level in aquifers, or emit too much pollution into the\nenvironment. Generally speaking, common pool resource\nproblems arise in situations where (i) individuals stand to benefit\nfrom using the resource to the greatest extent possible and (ii) the\nactions of any one individual have a negligible impact on the\nresource, but (iii) the actions of every individual taken together\nhave a large impact. In these cases it\u2019s often easy for an\nindividual to see that the actions of the community as a whole are\nproblematic, but because any individual\u2019s decision to refrain\nfrom exploiting a resource is unlikely to make a difference by itself,\nindividuals reasonably infer that they might as well exploit a\nresource for themselves while they can. As such, common pool resource\nproblems are a species of collective action problem and are\nanalogous in some ways to problems we\u2019ve discussed in previous\nsections (e.g., how to ensure that members of a community are willing\nto police norms even when doing so is costly).\n\nCommon pool resource problems are generally solved in one of two ways:\n(1) by taking the resource in question out of the commons, that is by\ncreating property rights in it, or (2) by finding ways to collectively\nmanage the resource, for instance by regulating who can access the\ncommons at a given time. Which approach is best suited to solving a\nparticular problem, and what form that approach should take, depends\non many factors, e.g., how excludable the resource is, whether it is\nstationary, and how quickly the resource can be regenerated. By\nproviding a framework for analyzing the strategic behavior of\nindividuals in different contexts, game theory provides a useful tool\nfor identifying the solutions most likely to work in a given case.\nHere Elinor Ostrom\u2019s work on common pool resources, which won\nher the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics, has been especially\ninfluential. Ostrom used game theoretic analysis complemented by\nextensive field work to show that, although there is a surprising\namount of diversity in the ways that communities have managed to\nsustainably govern common resources, the success of these approaches\ntends to be a function of a number of underlying principles (Ostrom\n1990). Some of these principles reflect things we\u2019ve already\ndiscussed in other contexts, e.g., the importance of monitoring and\nsanctions. While others are perhaps less obvious. For instance, the\nimportance of accommodating nested or overlapping jurisdictions of\nresponsibility. Because the ways in which these principles manifest\nthemselves is highly dependent on context, though, rather than saying\nmore about them here, we\u2019ll instead turn to another problem that\nhas received a lot of attention in environmental ethics: climate\nchange.\n\nGame theory has played an important role in the moral and political\nanalysis of climate change. In particular, it has been crucial to the\nanalysis of why addressing climate change is difficult. Here, the\nconsensus in the literature is that states (and other entities)\ninterested in addressing climate change confront a massive free\nrider problem stemming from that fact that many of the things\nthat can be done to prevent further climate change or mitigate its\neffects are either quasi-public goods or things which\ngenerate substantial positive externalities. For example,\ndrastic reductions of carbon emissions and increased investment in\ncarbon sequestration or alternative energy technologies are things\nwhich benefit most countries regardless of who invests in them. And,\nbecause investing in these things is costly (at least in the short\nterm), we tend to underinvest in them, a problem that is exacerbated\nby the fact that the most serious costs of climate change arguably\nfall on future generations.\n\nBroadly speaking there are two schools of thought with respect to how\nwe should confront the problem described above. One school exemplified\nby Garvey (2008), Gardiner (2011), and Broome (2012) acknowledges the\ncollective and political nature of the problem, but maintains that in\naddition to state action individuals have responsibilities to do\nthings like reduce their carbon footprints to mitigate the effects of\nclimate change. On the other hand, members of the other school of\nthought (e.g., Brennan 2009, Nordhaus 2014) tend to be skeptical of\nhow much unilateral action (at either the individual or state level)\ncan do, and so argue that our efforts are best spent trying to find\nworkable collective mechanisms to address climate change.\n",
