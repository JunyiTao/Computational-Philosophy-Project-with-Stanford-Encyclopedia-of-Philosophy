    "main_text": "Ancient and Modern Skepticism: Transitions || Augustine: Re-Conceiving Skepticism in a Theological Framework\n5.1 Augustine: Re-Conceiving Skepticism in a Theological Framework\n\nHistorians of philosophy sometimes argue that Henri Etienne\u2019s\nrediscovery of Sextus in 1562 initiated an era of epistemology. Early\nmodern engagement with skepticism is here seen as a turn to arguments\nfound in Sextus (Annas-Barnes 1985, 5\u20137; Bailey 2002,\n1\u201320). Via Cicero, early modern and modern philosophers seem to\nhave engaged also with Academic arguments (for a recent analysis of\nAcademic skepticism in Hume and Kant, cf. Gonz\u00e1lez Quintero\n2022). In particular the beginning of Descartes\u2019\nMeditations may display a kind of Socratic spirit: a\ncommitment to calling into question all one\u2019s beliefs. However,\nearly modern philosophers work within a theologically framed tradition\nthat importantly begins with St. Augustine (354\u2013430) (cf. Menn\n1998 and Lagerlund 2009; on the history of medieval skepticism cf.\nLagerlund ed. 2009; cf. Carriero 2009 on Descartes\u2019 engagement\nwith Aquinas; for an analysis of the transformation of skepticism that\nturns immediately to Descartes, cf. Williams 2010).\n\nA major part of Augustine\u2019s early education consisted in the\nstudy of Cicero\u2019s writings. He was thus closely acquainted with\nAcademic skepticism (Cicero was one kind of Academic skeptic).\nAugustine sees the force of ancient skeptical strategies. Even though\nhe does not become a skeptic, he integrates distinctively skeptical\nmoves into his thought. This has a long-standing effect on the history\nof theology and science. For example, Galileo Galilei is able to cite\nAugustine when he defends himself against the charge that his physics\nis in opposition to the Bible (Letter to the Grand Duchess,\nin Drake 1957). Augustine supplies arguments to the effect that we\nshould keep an open mind. Both our physical theories and our\ninterpretations of the Bible are likely to evolve. This idea figures\nimportantly in Pyrrhonism. Past experience tells us that, on every\ngiven issue, someone eventually came up with a new argument.\nAccordingly, even if the skeptics cannot find an objection to a given\nclaim right now, they expect that in the future, a conflicting view\nwill be formulated.\n\nHowever, such traces of skepticism are integrated into an ultimately\nnon-skeptical philosophy. In Contra Academicos, Augustine\nrecognizes a core feature of ancient skepticism, namely that it is a\ncommitment to ongoing inquiry (cf. Nawar 2019 on Augustine\u2019s\ndefense of knowledge against the skeptics in Contra\nAcademicos 3). The question that Augustine considers vital, then,\nis whether a life devoted to inquiry can be compelling, if seemingly\nthere is no prospect for ever attaining truth (cf. Lagerlund 2009). It\nis as a philosophy of inquiry that skepticism makes a lasting\ncontribution to ethics, continuing, as it were, a Socratic legacy\n(Vogt 2017).\n\nAugustine creates the framework that will become characteristic of\nearly modern discussions. First, in his work skeptical arguments are\nexplored in order to be refuted. Second, the key issue is whether we\nhave knowledge, not whether we should hold anything to be true. In\nAugustine, the background for caring so much about knowledge is the\npressing question of whether we can know God: whether we can know that\nhe exists and what his properties are. This might also be the reason\nwhy knowledge of testimony gains importance (De Trinitate,\n15.12; in Schoedinger 1996). The Bible, or parts of it, might be\nconsidered testimony about God, and accordingly as one possible way of\nattaining knowledge of God.\n\nThird, in the process of asking whether we can have knowledge of God\nit makes sense to distinguish between kinds of knowledge (sensory,\nrational, by testimony, etc.). If we know God, then we do so via one\nof the kinds of knowledge. This becomes a standard feature of\ndiscussions of skepticism. Philosophers go through the different kinds\nof knowledge that are conceivable, and examine them in turn. In\nAugustine as well as later authors, this includes mathematical\nknowledge (Nawar 2022). Though Sextus wrote on geometry and\narithmetic, questions about knowledge in mathematics do not shape\nHellenistic debates between skeptics on the one hand and Epicureans\nand Stoics on the other hand. Fourth, Augustine conceives of what he\ncalls \u2018inner knowledge.\u2019 He envisages a skeptical\nscenario. Suppose we have no sensory knowledge, no rational knowledge,\nand no knowledge of testimony. We still know that we think, love,\njudge, live, and are (De Trinitate 15.12). In the City of\nGod 11.26, Augustine uses his well-known phrase \u201csi\nenim fallor, sum\u201d (even if I err, I am). That is, Augustine\nsuggests that we have knowledge of our mental acts (cf. Nawar 2022 on\nAugustine\u2019s concern with self-knowledge). However, Augustine\ndoes not consider these pieces of knowledge foundational. While he\npoints to them when he discusses the challenges of Academic\nskepticism, he does not systematically build upon them in refuting\nskepticism about sense perception, rational knowledge, and knowledge\nof testimony. Rather, he refutes skepticism by stating that God\ncreated us and the things that are known to us; God wanted these\nthings to be known to us (De Trinitate 15.12). In later\nepistemology, the idea of the turn into one\u2019s mind and an\nintrospective access to one\u2019s mental acts becomes a secular\nidea. Augustine is a transitional figure in the philosophy of mind,\nand thereby re-conceives skepticism. By focussing on a gap between\n\u2018what is in the mind\u2019 and the world outside, he as it were\ninvites external world skepticism (Vogt 2014a). But Augustine is\nconcerned with the path to God: the mind turns into itself and\nfrom there it moves further, toward God (e.g., Confessions 7.\n17,23).\n\nNext to Augustine, Al-Ghazali (1085-1111) plays a major role in\nre-conceiving the questions relevant to skepticism (Menn 2003,\nKukkonen 2009). In The Rescuer From Error, Al-Ghazali\nliterally describes God as the rescuer from error (in Khalidi 2005).\nLike Augustine before and Descartes after him, Al-Ghazali moves\nthrough different cognitive faculties. Do the senses or reason allow\nus to gain knowledge? These questions are framed by the quest for\nknowledge of God. While Augustine thinks that knowledge of God comes\nthrough a combination of seeking God on the one hand and God\u2019s\ngrace on the other, Al-Ghazali thinks it comes through spiritual\nexercises. However, once confidence in God is secured, trust in the\nmore familiar ways of gaining knowledge\u2014sense perception,\nrational reasoning, and so on\u2014is restored (for a detailed\ntreatment of skepticism in Classical Islam, cf. Heck 2014).\n\nOne key difference between ancient skepticism on the one hand, and\nmedieval as well as Cartesian skepticism on the other, is that ancient\nskepticism is not framed by theological concerns. Note that in\nCartesian skepticism, God is not only invoked when it comes to\nrefuting skepticism. More importantly, the skeptical problems arise in\na way that depends on God as creator. Our cognitive faculties are seen\nas created faculties, and the world as a created world. A kind of\n\u2018faculty-skepticism\u2019 that asks whether our cognitive\nfaculties are built so as to be erroneous is formulated, and a\npotential gap between our minds and the world opens up. Perhaps God\nmade us in such a way that we are fundamentally wrong about everything\n(or, as later secular versions have it, a mad scientist experiments on\na \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d).\n\nThese are important steps away from the non-theological ancient\nconstrual of skepticism. The theological premises of early modern\nskepticism are not only foreign to ancient debates; they would be seen\nas misguided. From the Hellenistic point of view, theology is part of\nphysics. An account of god is part of an account of the natural world\n(as such, it is unrecognizable as \u2018theology\u2019 from the\npoint of view of later theologies). Human beings and their cognitive\nfaculties are natural parts of a natural world. They are organic and\nfunctional parts, interconnected with the other parts of the large\nwhole which the universe is. A mind-world-gap (of the kind envisaged\nin the Cartesian tradition) is inconceivable. Each \u2018mind,\u2019\nand that is, rational soul, is an integrated physical part of the\nphysical world. Like a part of a complex organism, it would not exist\nwere it not for the interrelations it has with the other parts. A\nphysiological account of the mind makes the stark divide between mind\nand world that figures in early modern skepticism unimaginable.\n",
