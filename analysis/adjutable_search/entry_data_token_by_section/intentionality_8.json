    "main_text": "Can intentionality be naturalized?\n9. Can intentionality be naturalized?\n\nAs we saw in section 8, Quine (1960, 220), a leading critic of\nintentional objects (in the sense of section 7), agrees with Chisholm\n(1957) that the intentional vocabulary cannot be reduced to some\nnon-intentional vocabulary. Chisholm (1957) took this conclusion to\nshow the correctness of Brentano\u2019s third thesis that\nintentionality is the mark of the mental. From the same\nconclusion, Quine (1960, 221) presented an influential dilemma with\nboth epistemological and ontological implications. The first horn of\nthe dilemma is to accept the \u201cindispensability of intentional\nidioms and the importance of an autonomous science of intention\u201d\nand to reject a physicalist ontology. The second horn of the same\ndilemma is to accept physicalism and renounce the\n\u201cbaselessness\u201d of the intentional idioms and the\n\u201cemptiness\u201d of a science of intention. This dilemma has\nbeen influential in contemporary philosophy of mind.\n\nThe common legacy of Chisholm (1957) and Quine (1960) is the\nlinguistic view of intentionality (accepted by e.g., Dennett 1969).\nWhether intensionality is indeed the defining criterion of\nintentionality, one can certainly question Brentano\u2019s thesis\nthat only mental phenomena exhibit intentionality by noticing\nthat some non-mental things exhibit something very much like\nBrentano\u2019s intentional inexistence, namely sentences of natural\nlanguages. Sentences of natural languages have meaning and by virtue\nof having meaning, they can be, just like states of mind, directed\ntowards things other than themselves, some of which need not exist in\nspace and time. Sentences of natural languages, however, are\nnon-mental things.\n\nOne influential response to this objection to this part of\nBrentano\u2019s third thesis has been to grant a second-rate, i.e., a\ndegraded and dependent, intentional status to sentences (see Haugeland\n1981, Searle 1980, 1983, 1992, Fodor 1987). On this view, sentences of\nnatural languages have no intrinsic meaning of and by themselves. Nor\ndo utterances of sentences have an intrinsic content. Sentences of\nnatural languages would fail to have any meaning unless it was\nconferred to them by people who use them to express their thoughts and\ncommunicate them to others. Utterances borrow whatever\n\u2018derived\u2019 intentionality they have from the\n\u2018original\u2019 (or \u2018primitive\u2019) intentionality of\nhuman beings with minds that use them for their purposes (see Dennett\n1987 for dissent). If, as Jerry Fodor (1975, 1987, 1994, 1998, 2008)\nhas argued, there exists a \u201clanguage of thought\u201d\nconsisting of mental symbols with syntactic and semantic properties,\nthen possibly the semantic properties of mental symbols are the\nprimary bearers of \u2018original\u2019 intentionality. (See the\nentry on the\n language of thought hypothesis.)\n\nSo the question is: does any non-mental thing exhibit\n\u2018original\u2019 intentionality? The question is made more\npressing by Quine\u2019s dilemma, according to which one must choose\nbetween Brentano\u2019s third thesis and a physicalist ontology.\nSo-called \u2018eliminative materialists\u2019 (see Churchland 1989)\nresolutely opt for the second horn of Quine\u2019s dilemma and deny\npurely and simply the reality of human beliefs and desires. As a\nconsequence of their denial of the reality of beliefs and desires, the\neliminative materialists must face the challenge raised by the\nexistence of physical objects whose existence depends on the\nintentions, beliefs and desires of their designers, i.e., human\nartifacts. Others, like Daniel Dennett (1971, 1978, 1987, 2017), who\nrejects any sharp distinction between original and derived\nintentionality on the grounds that original intentionality itself is\nthe output of natural selection, take a so-called\n\u2018instrumentalist\u2019 position. On Dennett\u2019s view, the\nintentional idiom fails to describe or explain any real phenomenon.\nHowever, in the absence of detailed knowledge of the physical laws\nthat govern the behavior of a physical system, the intentional idiom\n(the \u2018intentional stance\u2019 as Dennett calls it) is a useful\nstance for predicting a system\u2019s behavior. Among philosophers\nattracted to a physicalist ontology, few have accepted the outright\neliminativist materialist denial of the reality of beliefs and\ndesires. Nor have many of them found it easy to answer the puzzling\nquestion raised by the instrumentalist position: how can the\nintentional idiom make useful predictions if it fails to describe and\nexplain anything real?\n\nA significant number of physicalist philosophers subscribe to the task\nof reconciling the existence of intentionality with a physicalist\nontology (for a forceful exposition see Field 1978, 78\u201379). On\nthe assumption that intentionality is central to the mental, the task\nis to show, in Dennett\u2019s (1969, 21) terms, that there is\nnot an \u201cunbridgeable gulf between the mental and the\nphysical\u201d or that one can subscribe to both physicalism and\nintentional realism. Because intentional states are of or\nabout things other than themselves, for a state to have\nintentionality is for it to have semantic properties. As Jerry Fodor\n(1984) put it, the naturalistic worry of intentional realists who are\nphysicalists is that \u201cthe semantic proves permanently\nrecalcitrant to integration to the natural order\u201d. Given that on\na physicalist ontology, intentionality or semantic properties cannot\nbe \u201cfundamental features of the world,\u201d the task is to\nshow \u201chow an entirely physical system could nevertheless exhibit\nintentional states\u201d (Fodor, 1987). As Dretske (1981) puts it,\nthe task is to show how to \u201cbake a mental cake using only\nphysical yeast and flour\u201d. Notice that Brentano\u2019s own view\nthat \u2018no physical phenomenon manifests\u2019 intentionality is\nsimply unacceptable to a physicalist. If physicalism is true, then\nsome physical things are also mental things. The question for a\nphysicalist is: does any non-mental thing manifest intentionality?\n\nClearly, one way to relieve the tension between physicalism and\nintentional realism is to argue that intentionality can be, and in\nfact is, exhibited by non-mental things. There have been several\nproposals in analytic philosophy in the past twenty years to suggest\nways of accomplishing this program, which has been called \u2018the\nnaturalization of intentionality.\u2019 The common strategy is to\nshow that Brentano was wrong in claiming that only mental things can\nexhibit intentionality. This strategy is related to the assumption\nthat intentional relations whose relata are concrete particulars\nshould have primacy over intentional relations whose relata are not\n(see\n section 7).\n I shall illustrate two distinct proposals for implementing this\ncommon goal.\n\nOne influential strategy for showing that non-mental things can\nexhibit intentionality has been Fred Dretske\u2019s (1980, 1981,\n1994) information-theoretic proposal that a device that\ncarries information does exhibit some degree of intentionality. The\nview is an extension of Paul Grice\u2019s (1957) notion of\nnatural meaning: unlike the English word \u2018fire,\u2019\nwhich non-naturally means fire, smoke naturally means fire. The word\n\u2018fire\u2019 can be tokened in the absence of any fire either\nfor the purpose of expressing a thought about what to do if there was\none or perhaps to mislead somebody else into falsely thinking that\nthere is one. But there cannot be any smoke unless there is a fire. As\nwe shall see momentarily, it is a feature of both the original\nintentionality of beliefs and the derived intentionality of utterances\nthat they can be misrepresentations.\n\nIn essence, the information-theoretic proposal is that device\nS carries information about instantiations of property\nG if and only if S\u2019s being F is\nnomically correlated with instantiations of G. If S\nwould not be F unless property G were instantiated,\nthen S\u2019s being F carries information about, or\nas Dretske likes to say, indicates G-ness. A fingerprint\ncarries information about the identity of the human being whose finger\nwas imprinted. Spots on a human face carry information about a\ndisease. The height of the column of mercury in a thermometer carries\ninformation about the temperature. A gas-gauge on the dashboard of a\ncar carries information about the amount of fuel in the car tank. The\nposition of a needle in a galvanometer carries information about the\nflow of electric current. A compass carries information about the\nlocation of the North pole. In all such cases, a property of a\nphysical device nomically covaries with some physical property\ninstantiated in its environment (for critical discussion of the\ninformational program, see Kistler 2000, Loewer 1987, 1998 and Putnam\n1986).\n\nNow, insofar as it is not a law that polar bears live at the\nNorth pole, even though they happen to live there, a compass will fail\nto carry information about where polar bears happen to live in spite\nof the fact that it does carry information about the North pole. If\nso, then reports of what a compass indicates exhibit one of\nChisholm\u2019s features of intensionality, namely coextensive terms\nare not freely substitutable salva veritate in such reports.\nBy contrast, if it is law that variations of temperature covary with\nvariations in atmospheric pressure, then by virtue of indicating the\ntemperature, the height of the column of mercury in a thermometer will\nalso indicate atmospheric pressure. If there is a law relating current\nflow to voltage differences, then by indicating the former, a\ngalvanometer will indicate the latter. One can, however, believe and\neven know that there is a current flow between two points without\nbelieving, let alone knowing, that there is a voltage difference\nbetween the two points, if one fails to know that it is a law that if\nthere is flow of electric current between two points, then there is a\nvoltage difference between these two points (see Jacob 1997 for\ndiscussion).\n\nSo although reports of the information carried by such physical\ndevices exhibit some of the intensionality exhibited by reports of\nintentional mental states, the intensionality exhibited by the latter\nis clearly stronger than the intensionality exhibited by the former.\nOn the one hand, it is difficult to generate the strong intentionality\nof mental states from the information-theoretic account of the weak\nintentionality of non-mental things. On the other hand, given that the\ninformation relation is the converse of a nomic correlation, it is\ndifficult for informational semantics to account for misrepresentation\nas well as for the normativity of the contents of mental states. See\nthe entry on\n causal theories of mental content..\n\nA second influential proposal for dealing with the difficulties left\npending by the information-theoretic approach and for showing that\nsome non-mental things can exhibit intentionality has been Ruth\nMillikan\u2019s (1984, 1993, 2000, 2004) teleosemantic\napproach. Millikan\u2019s teleosemantic approach rests on two basic\nassumptions, the first of which is that (unlike a natural sign) an\nintentional representation is a relatum in a three-place relation\ninvolving two mechanisms: a producer of the representation and a\nconsumer, both of which are cooperative devices whose activities are\nbeneficial to both. Millikan\u2019s second assumption is that\nBrentano\u2019s relation of intentional inexistence is exhibited by\nbiological functions. Given any sort of biological purpose or design,\nit might fail to be fulfilled. For example, if it is the function or\npurpose of a mammal\u2019s heart to pump blood, then a mammal\u2019s\nheart ought to pump blood even though it might fail to do so. Notice,\nhowever, that whereas biological organs have functions that may fail\nto be fulfilled, they do not ipso facto exhibit\nintentionality in Brentano\u2019s full sense: neither a heart nor a\nstomach are of or about anything. Millikan\u2019s\nclaim, however, is not that having a function is sufficient for\naboutness, but that it is necessary. Arguably, a device cannot be\nabout or represent anything unless it can misrepresent what it is\nabout. Presumably, for a device to misrepresent what it is about is\nfor it to misfunction. But unless the device had some function, it\ncould simply not misfunction. If this is correct, then nothing could\nbe a representational system\u2014nothing could have content or\nintentionality\u2014unless it had what Millikan (1984) calls a\n\u2018proper\u2019 function.\n\nThe relevant notion of a function here is the biological teleological,\nnot the dispositional one: the function of an organ is not what the\norgan is disposed to do, but what it was selected to do (see Millikan\n1984 and Neander 1995). Arguably, nothing can have a function unless\nit results from some historical process of selection or other.\nSelection processes are design processes. Most advocates of\nteleosemantics accept the etiological account of functions according\nto which the function of a device is a selected effect, i.e. an effect\nproduced by the device that explains the continued proliferation of\ntokens of this type of device. Thus, according to\n\u201cteleosemantic\u201d theories, design is the main source of\nfunction, which in turn is the source of content or intentionality.\nSuch theories are called \u201cteleosemantic\u201d theories in\nvirtue of the connection between design or teleology and content. One\ncontentious issue is whether the teleological approach championed by\nMillikan can be combined with informational semantics so that\nS can be said to represent instances of property F\nif and only if it is S\u2019s function to carry information\nabout F. On the one hand, against this proposal, Millikan\n(2004) has argued that the information carried by a sign depends on\nits causes, not its effects: according to teleosemantics and the\netiological approach to functions, the function of a device is one of\nits effects: it does not depend on its causes. On the other hand,\nMillikan (2017) proposes to redefine the border between concepts and\npercepts by deepening her semiotic approach to perception based on the\nrelated twin notions of unicepts and unitrackers.\nNeander (2017) and Shea (2018) have further explored the possibility\nof combining informational semantics and a teleological approach. For\nfurther discussion of teleosemantics, see the SEP entry on\nteleological theories of mental content and the papers collected in\nRyder, Kinsbury and Williford (eds.)(2011).\n\nNow, selection processes can be intentional or non-intentional.\nArtifacts (including words and other symbols of natural languages)\nderive their functions from some intentional process. While\npsychological mechanisms (e.g., belief-forming mechanisms) derive\ntheir proper functions from a non-intentional selection\nprocess, particular belief states have derived proper functions. The\nparadigmatic non-intentional process is the process of natural\nselection by which Charles Darwin explained the phylogenetic evolution\nof biological species: natural selection sorts organisms that survive.\nBut no intentional agent is responsible for the sorting. Millikan\n(1984, 2004, 2005) has also extended her teleosemantic approach to the\ncontents of intentional conventional signs (i.e. linguistic symbols).\nIf this sort of teleosemantic proposal could be fully worked out, then\nit would kill two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it would\npoint a way in which the intentionality of minds derives from the\nintentionality of biological things (see Rowlands 1999 for\ndiscussion). On the other hand, it would show that some of the\nnormativity of mental states is already exhibited by biological\nfunctions (see Neander, 1995). Both questions are currently topics of\nmuch discussion in the philosophy of mind. Many philosophers such as\nDavidson (1980), Kripke (1982), McDowell (1994) and Putnam (1988,\n1994), for example, have either expressed serious reservations about\nthe program or provided reasons for scepticism. For further\ndiscussion, see the essays in MacDonald and Papineau (eds.) 2006, and\nalso the entries on\n teleological theories of mental content\n and\n teleological notions in biology.\n Subsequently Burge (2010) criticized attempts to naturalize\nintentionality by appeal to the notion of biological function on the\ngrounds that it is, according to him, a deep mistake to identify\nrepresentational success (truth or accuracy) with fulfillment of\nbiological function and representational failure (falsity or\ninaccuracy) with failure of biological function. Unlike\nrepresentational (or semantic) success or failure, fulfillment or\nfailure of a biological function is, according to Burge, practical\nsuccess or failure.\n",
