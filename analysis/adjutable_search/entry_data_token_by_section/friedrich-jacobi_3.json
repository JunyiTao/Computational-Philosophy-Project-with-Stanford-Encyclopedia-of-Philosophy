This was not confined to private\nletters but also appeared in publications, such as Mendelssohn\u2019s\nimmediate reaction \u2018An die Freunde Lessings\u2019 and\nJacobi\u2019s couterreaction \u2018Wider Mendelssohns\nBeschuldigungen betreffend die Briefe \u00fcber die Lehre des\nSpinoza\u2019 (1786) (JWA 1, 2: 376\u2013377). If we interpret the\n\u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 as a concrete advance in\nJacobi\u2019s careful consideration of the specificity of the\nterminology that he proposed in the first edition of the\n\u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019, its second edition brings to the fore\nthe conclusive general outcome of the Spinoza controversy: freedom\nbecomes the main topic in light of the function it fulfills within the\nepistemology of what is actually true (JWA 1, 2: 370).\n\nThe new materials provided include further documentation of\nMendelssohn\u2019s letters, eight supplements, mainly on\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy and its relation to Leibniz, a reasoned\npetition in favor of a personal God, by contrast with pantheism, and\nfinally a list of theses (52) on human freedom. This list is\nparticularly interesting. It presents 23 theses in opposition to human\nfreedom and 29 in support of it. Contrary to any conjecture of a\npossible convergence between Jacobi\u2019s argument in favor of human\nfreedom and Kant\u2019s practical principles, it must be stressed\nthat Jacobi\u2019s countervailing theses are not antinomic. They\nrather show an evolution of his thesis in support of human freedom\nfrom a critical assessment of fatalism (Homann, 1973). The distinct\ndivision between the two realms of reality, one incorporating freedom\nand the other disregarding it, is foreign to Jacobi\u2019s\nintention.\n\nMoreover, fatalism follows a mechanical understanding of the notion of\ncause, which necessarily leads to the belief that the corporeal\n(extended being) and the theoretical (representational being) realms\nboth consist of a sequence of conjoined instances. In opposition to\nthis picture, Jacobi places his pharmakon, made of an\ninterplay between the activity and passivity of the I and its opposing\nThou. As Jacobi shows in the \u2018David Hume\nDialogue\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 277\u2013278 and JWA 2,1:\n37\u201339) and broadly advances here, a total mechanization of\nreality in the sense of an entire whole made of things properly\ndetermined by their explanations reduces all things to nothing (JWA 1,\n1: 263).\n\nSystematically understood, explanations deprive what is explained of\nits independent substance and make the whole (the enclosed system of\nexplanation) the only substance. So too, the same\nall\u2013encompassing substance is devoid of its existence, as\nexistence is and can only be based upon the active engagement of an\nagent. (Jacobi, 1994(2): 370\u2013372 and JWA 1,1: 247\u2013249). If\nwe take a closer look at the 52 theses on human freedom, it can be\nunderstood that the theory supporting human freedom presents a broader\nconception of reality than the one in opposition to it. Jacobi does\nnot merely draft his idea of reality in contrast to the systematic\nconception of reality but in adjusting its tenets and substituting its\ncore principle. According to the resulting picture, the unjustified\n(that is, in a sense, disconnected and even unknown) autonomy of the\npractical I must be preserved as the basis of any justified and\nsystematic knowledge of reality. The autonomy of the I is thus the\nfoundation of existence (Jacobi, 1994(2): 344 and JBW 12: 207).\nFollowing out this line of reasoning, Jacobi addresses Kant\u2019s\npractical philosophy as presented in the \u2018Critique of Practical\nReason\u2019, which came out just one year before the second edition\nof the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019, to make the paradigm of reality\nfrom the spontaneous activity of a finite subject. As a paradigm,\nthen, the latter should not itself be subject to further explanation\nby systematic philosophy. Instead, explanation must halt before it\n(Jacobi, 1994(2): 345 and JWA 1,1: 163\u2013164).\n\nApparently, Fichte followed Jacobi\u2019s logic concerning the\nnecessity of a practical basis for reality, but he did not respect the\nfinal rule, unleashing the systematic approach upon the definition of\nthe foundation of existence. This encourages Jacobi\u2019s reaction:\nthe famous \u2018Jacobi an Fichte\u2019 thus reads as a further\nevolution of issues raised in the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019.\n",
