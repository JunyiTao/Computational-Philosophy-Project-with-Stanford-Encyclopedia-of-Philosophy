What Philosophical Research is\n\nIn the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice, a diatribe against\nfalse knowledge, composed between 1217 and 1225 in Aleppo or in\nAnatolia, \u2018Abd al-Latif presents \u201ctwo pieces of\nadvice\u201d for would-be physicians and would-be philosophers, an\nimpassioned polemic against false physicians, and an equally harsh\ninvective against false philosophers (see Gutas 2011; Martini Bonadeo\n2013; Joosse 2014; Jad 2017; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018).\n\nThose who, in his age, devote themselves to philosophy are bad\nphilosophers for many different reasons: their lack of interest, the\nobscurity of philosophy and their lack of training and good teachers.\nBut the main reason for the decline of the philosophical production of\nhis age lies in the neglect into which the works of the Ancients have\nfallen. The pages of these works are by now being used by bookbinders\nand pharmacists as paper for packaging. No one\u2014says \u2018Abd\nal-Latif\u2014wants to deny the contributions made by Avicenna to\nphilosophical research. He has, in fact, provided new energy to\nphilosophy, and he has been able in part to understand the books of\nthe Ancients and to offer an introduction to them. Nevertheless, if\none examines his works in more detail and compares them with those on\nsimilar themes by ancient authors and, in particular, with Aristotle\nor al-Farabi, their inferiority emerges. For this reason \u2018Abd\nal-Latif proposes presenting the method followed by Plato and\nAristotle in their respective philosophies. In doing that, he follows\nal-Farabi, summarizes and literally quotes al-Farabi\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Plato and Aristotle (Rosenthal & Walzer\n1943; Mahdi 1961, 2001), where both Platonic dialogues and\nAristotelian treatises are set out in such an order as to constitute a\nsystematic and progressive investigation of all the areas of\nphilosophical research.\n\nFor \u2018Abd al-Latif, as for al-Farabi\u2019s Plato, philosophical\nresearch begins with an investigation of what constitutes the\nperfection of man as man, which does not consist of a healthy\nphysique, a pleasant face, noble descent, a large group of friends and\nlovers; nor does it consist in riches, glory, or power, since none of\nthese is able to make man fully and truly happy. For man the\nattainment of happiness consists in a particular type of knowledge,\nthe knowledge of the substances of all the beings and a certain\nlifestyle, the virtuous life. Knowledge of things according to their\nessence is not an end in itself, but is that which must characterize\nthe virtuous lifestyle of the philosopher: in him, in fact,\ntheoretical knowledge is the prolegomenon to action, ethics, and\npolitics. For this reason \u2018Abd al-Latif stresses that there is\nno difference between a man who lives in ignorance and the life of\nbeasts because in ignorance man acts like a beast. A life in ignorance\nis a life without the search for truth and, hence, inhuman in\nitself.\n\nIn this perspective \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces Plato\u2019s\npolitical philosophy. Since the perfection of the soul is possible\nonly in a city where justice reigns, Plato starts from analysis of\nwhat justice is and how it ought to be. Then Plato examines the cities\nwhich deviate from the good ways of life and from the philosophical\nvirtues. In the virtuous city, man must be educated in the knowledge\nof the divine and natural beings and in following a virtuous way of\nlife. Human perfection is achieved by the man who combines the\ntheoretical, the political and the practical sciences. He will rule\nand will possess the ability to conduct a scientific investigation of\njustice and the other virtues and to form the character of the youth\nand the multitude. He will be able to correct wrong opinions and to\ncure every rank of his society with knowledge. The ruler will be the\none who has achieved human perfection at its utmost.\n\nThen \u2018Abd al-Latif passes to present al-Farabi\u2019s Aristotle\nwho holds that the perfection of man sought by Plato is not\nself-evident or easy to explain by way of a demonstration which leads\nto certainty. He believes, therefore, that it is necessary to start\nwith a prior consideration. There are four things which by nature are\ndesired by man in so far as they are good: the soundness of the body,\nof the senses, of the ability to discern that which leads to the\nhealth of the body and the senses, and of the ability to obtain that\nwhich leads to their soundness. In the second place man desires to\nknow the causes of the sensible things and also the causes of what he\nsees in his soul, and he discovers that the more he knows the more he\nfeels pleasure. Thus according to Aristotle, the knowledge sought by\nman can be said to be of two types: the first is a useful knowledge\nsought for the soundness of the body, of the senses, and of the other\ntwo abilities, the second is desired and desirable in itself for the\npleasure that a man experiences in apprehending it: for instance, the\nmyths or the stories of nations.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif goes on by explaining that in human knowledge\nthere are three sorts of cognitions: those acquired by senses,\nfrequently insufficient, those first necessary cognitions that\noriginate with man, and those acquired by investigation and\nconsideration. \u2018Abd al-Latif asks himself what type of knowledge\nis most appropriate for man. Animals, too, in fact, have a body,\nsenses, and the ability to discern how and with what to safeguard\ntheir health. They do not, however, possess the desire, provoked by\nwonder, to know the causes of what can be seen in the heavens and on\nearth.\n\nThis problem involves the following question: why should man ever\ndesire to know the causes if the type of knowledge that they involve\nis not made for him? It is because man can grow in perfection by\nknowing the causes; indeed, knowing the causes is an act of the\nessence of man. Yet this statement opens up a series of problems. What\nis the essence of man, what is his ultimate perfection, what is the\nact whose realization leads to the final perfection of his essence?\nNevertheless, given that man is part of the world, if one wishes to\nknow the end of man and his activity he must first know the world in\nits totality. The four causes of the world in its totality and in each\nof its individual parts which must be sought are the what it is, the\nhow it is, the what it is from, and the what is it for.\n\nThe investigation which deals with the world, in its totality and in\neach of its individual parts, is called natural investigation, while\nthat which regards what man possesses by virtue and will is called the\nscience of the things that depend on the will. Since that which is\nnatural and innate in man precedes in time that which is in man by\nwill and choice, the first type of investigation will precede the\nsecond even if both must arrive at a certain science. Besides these\ntwo types of research is the art of logic which forms the rational\npart of the soul, leads it to certainty, to study and to research;\nlogic, moreover, guides and tests the validity of the other two fields\nof research.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif reminds that in Aristotle\u2019s science of\nnature the fundamental epistemological criterion holds that man must\nstart from what is attested to by the senses, to then proceed to what\nis hidden, until he knows everything which he desires to know. For\nthis reason, he goes on in the study of plants and then of animals. He\ncatalogues their species, and explains the apparatus of organs which\neach animal species is provided with. Since organs alone are not\nsufficient to explain animal life, man feels the need to introduce a\nfurther principle, which is the soul. Nevertheless, the soul is not a\nprinciple sufficient to explain man, since the actions of man reveal\nthemselves to be more powerful than the acts of the soul. The soul is\nnot enough to explain the highest degree of substantiality reached by\nman: Aristotle found man with speech and speech proceeds from\nintellect or the intellectual principles and powers.\n\nThe human intellect is in potency and moves to act. All that which\npasses from potency to act necessitates an agent of the same species\nas the thing that must pass on to the act. The intellect as well,\ntherefore, in order to pass from potency to act, needs an active\nintellect which is always in act and never in potency. When\nman\u2019s intellect reaches its extreme perfection, it comes close\nin its substance to the substance of this active intellect. In its\nsearch for perfection, man\u2019s intellect tends to imitate the\nmodel of this intellect, since it is that which makes man substantial\nin so far as he is man. This intellect is also man\u2019s end because\nit is that which provides him with a principle and an example to\nfollow in tending to perfection, which consists in approximating\nhimself as far as it is possible to it. It is therefore his agent, his\nend, and his perfection. It is a principle in three different ways: as\nan agent, as an end, and as the perfection to which man tends. It is,\nhowever, a separate form with respect to man, a separate agent, and a\nseparate end.\n\nThe result of the enquiry undertaken leads to the conclusion that\nhuman nature, the human soul, and the capabilities and the acts of\nthese two, just like the capabilities of the practical intellect, are\nall finalized with respect to the perfection of the human intellect.\nNature, the soul, and the human intellect are, however, insufficient\nto attain perfection and it is not possible to leave out of\nconsideration the acts generated by volition and choice which depend\non the practical intellect. For this reason, therefore, these acts\nmust also become the object of investigation like all that which\nconstitutes human will. Desire and the things, which depend on sense\nand discernment\u2014which the other animals also possess\u2014on\nthe other hand, are neither human, nor useful for attaining\ntheoretical perfection. According to this criterion it is necessary to\nre-examine completely all the scientific fields already established in\nthe search for that which contributes to the attainment of perfection\nby man and that which, on the other hand, impedes this search.\n\nFinally \u2018Abd al-Latif mentions the Metaphysics saying\nthat in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics beings are investigated\naccording to a different method from that used in the science of\nnature. Unlike his Farabian source, al-Farabi\u2019s Philosophy\nof Plato and Aristotle, \u2018 as we know it, Abd al-Latif\nbegins to analyze the metaphysical science which has as its objects of\ninquiry the divine and noble things. He seems to mention the\npseudo-Theology of Aristotle, the paraphrastic selection from\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads (IV to VI) translated by \u2018Abd\nal-Masih ibn Nai\u2018ma al-Himsi and corrected by al-Kindi. He\nstates that Aristotle in the Theology (Kitab\nbi-utulugiyya) said that God created the terrestrial world for\nman and also created in man the intellect and dispersed it in his soul\nso that it might be a weapon which strengthens man to make him able to\nlive in the earth (i.e., practical intellect) and to investigate the\ncreation of the heavens and the earth and the wonders which are found\nin the heavens and on the earth (i.e., theoretical intellect). And he\nsays that God is provident and takes care of qualitatively better men\nand inspires them as a result of the mediation of the active intellect\neither through the way of meditation, or through the way of the\neffulgence of soul or through the way of revelation.\n\nOf course since men are different there are different forms of assent\nto the truth: the absolute certainty of the man who follows the\ndemonstrative way as indicated by Aristotle in the Posterior\nAnalytics and the persuasion produced by examples and images as\nindicated by Aristotle in the Rhetoric and the\nPoetics. Hence, philosophy comes into being in every man in\nthe way that is possible for him.\n\nFor \u2018Abd al-Latif, Plato and his disciple Aristotle pursue the\nsame purpose and the same end in their philosophical speculation, that\nis to say, the perfection of man as man, which both identify in\nknowledge of the truth of things. Moreover, they describe a system so\nperfect in its organic constitution and completeness that the\ngenerations following them are left with nothing but the task of\nstudying it in an attempt to understand their thought correctly. The\nexceptional nature of Plato and Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, says\n\u2018Abd al-Latif, has three causes: first, their philosophy is\nuseful in motivating one to study, second, for a long time they had\ninfluence in this field, and third, the absolute primacy of their\nphilosophy lies in their research into the causes from the more\ndistant to the closest to the object. This method of inquiry does not\nneed anything else and it is impossible to confute. It is therefore a\ngreat mistake to believe that the works of the Moderns are clearer,\nmore useful, or qualitatively superior with respect to those of the\nAncients.\n",
