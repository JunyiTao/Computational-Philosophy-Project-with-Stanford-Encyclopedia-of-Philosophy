    "main_text": "A Unificationist Account of Explanation || Illustrations of the Unificationist Model\n5.2 Illustrations of the Unificationist Model\n\nAs an illustration, consider Kitcher\u2019s treatment of the problem\nof explanatory asymmetries (recall\n Section 2.5).\n Our present explanatory practices\u2014call these P\u2014are\ncommitted to the idea that derivations of a flagpole\u2019s height\nfrom the length of its shadow are not explanatory. Kitcher compares\nP with an alternative systemization in which such derivations\nare regarded as explanatory. According to Kitcher, P includes\nthe use of a single \u201corigin and development\u201d (OD)\npattern of explanation, according to which the dimensions of\nobjects-artifacts, mountains, stars, organisms etc. are traced to\n\u201cthe conditions under which the object originated and the\nmodifications it has subsequently undergone\u201d (1989: 485). Now\nconsider the consequences of adding to P an additional pattern\nS (the shadow pattern) which permits the derivation of the\ndimensions of objects from facts about their shadows. Since the\nOD pattern already permits the derivation of all facts about\nthe dimensions of objects, the addition of the shadow pattern S\nto P will increase the number of argument patterns in P\nand will not allow us to derive any new conclusions. On the other\nhand, if we were to drop OD from P and replace it with\nthe shadow pattern, we would have no net change in the number of\npatterns in P, but would be able to derive far fewer\nconclusions than we would with OD, since many objects do not\nhave shadows (or enough shadows) from which to derive all of their\ndimensions. Thus OD belongs to the explanatory store, and the\nshadow pattern does not. Kitcher\u2019s treatment of other familiar\nproblem cases is similar. For example he claims that explanations that\ncontain irrelevancies (such as Salmon\u2019s birth control pills case\nare less unifying than competing explanations that do not contain such\nirrelevancies. \n\nKitcher acknowledges that there is nothing in the unificationist\naccount per se that requires that all explanation be\ndeductive: \u201cthere is no bar in principle to the use of\nnon-deductive arguments in the systemization of our beliefs\u201d.\nNonetheless, \u201cthe task of comparing the unifying power of\ndifferent systemizations looks even more formidable if non-deductive\narguments are considered\u201d and in part for this reason Kitcher\nendorses the view that \u201cin a certain sense, all explanation\nis deductive\u201d (1989: 448).\n\nWhat is the role of causation on this account? Kitcher claims that\n\u201cthe \u2018because\u2019 of causation is always derivative\nfrom the \u2018because\u2019 of explanation.\u201d (1989: 477).\nThat is, our causal judgments simply reflect the explanatory\nrelationships that fall out of our (or our intellectual\nancestors\u2019 ) attempts to construct unified theories of nature.\nThere is no independent causal order over and above this which our\nexplanations must capture. Like many other philosophers, Kitcher takes\nvery seriously (even if in the end he perhaps does not fully endorse)\nstandard empiricist or Humean worries about the epistemic\naccessibility and intelligibility of causal claims. Taking causal,\ncounterfactual or other notions belonging to the same family as\nprimitive in the theory of explanation is problematic. Kitcher\nbelieves that it is a virtue of his theory that it does not do this.\nInstead, Kitcher proposes to begin with the notion of explanatory\nunification, characterized in terms of constraints on deductive\nsystemizations, where these constraints can be specified in a quite\ngeneral way that is independent of causal or counterfactual notions,\nand then show how the causal claims we accept derive from our efforts\nat unification.\n",
