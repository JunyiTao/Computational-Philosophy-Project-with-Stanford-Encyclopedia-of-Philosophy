In his 1794 \u201cAdvice to his\ndaughter\u201d, Condorcet refers to texts and fragments by his wife,\nbesides the eight letters on sympathy, dealing with moral philosophy.\nIn 1792 Grouchy wrote to Etienne Dumont to ask him to read a draft of\nthe Letters and the beginning of a philosophical novel. The\nfragments have not been found so far, and it is possible that they\nwere destroyed.\n",
