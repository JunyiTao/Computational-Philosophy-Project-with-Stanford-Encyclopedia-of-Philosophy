    "main_text": "Postmodern Rhetoric and Aesthetics\n8. Postmodern Rhetoric and Aesthetics\n Rhetoric and aesthetics pertain to the sharing of experience\nthrough activities of participation and imitation.  In the postmodern\nsense, such activities involve sharing or participating in differences\nthat have opened between the old and the new, the natural and the\nartificial, or even between life and death.  The leading exponent of\nthis line of postmodern thought is Mario Perniola. Like Vattimo,\nPerniola insists that postmodern philosophy must not break with the\nlegacies of modernity in science and politics. As he says\nin Enigmas, \u201cthe relationship between thought and\nreality that the Enlightenment, idealism, and Marxism have embodied\nmust not be broken\u201d (Perniola 1995, 43). However, he does not\nbase this continuity upon an internal essence, spirit, or meaning, but\nupon the continuing effects of modernity in the world. One such\neffect, visible in art and in the relation between art and society, is\nthe collapse of the past and future into the present, which he\ncharacterizes as \u201cEgyptian\u201d or \u201cbaroque\u201d in\nnature. This temporal effect is accomplished through the collapse of\nthe difference between humans and things, where \u201chumans are\nbecoming more similar to things, and equally, the inorganic world,\nthanks to electronic technology, seems to be taking over the human\nrole in the perception of events\u201d (Perniola\n1995, viii). This amounts to a kind of\n\u201cEgyptianism,\u201d as described by Hegel in\nhis Aesthetics (see Hegel 1823\u20139, 347-361), where the\nspiritual and the natural are mixed to such a degree that they cannot\nbe separated, as, for example, in the figure of the Sphinx.  However,\nin the postmodern world the inorganic is not natural, but already\nartificial, insofar as our perceptions are mediated by technological\noperations. \n\nLikewise, says Perniola, art collections in modern museums produce a\n\u201cbaroque effect,\u201d where \u201cThe field that is opened\nup by a collection is not that of cultivated public opinion, nor of\nsocial participation, but a space that attracts precisely because it\ncannot be controlled or possessed\u201d (Perniola 1995, 87). That\nis, in the collection, art is removed from its natural or historical\ncontext and creates a new sense of space and time, not reducible to\nlinear history or any sense of origin. The collection, then, is\nemblematic of postmodern society, a moment of its\n\u201ctruth.\u201d Furthermore, Perniola insists that baroque\nsensibility is characteristic of Italian society and culture in\ngeneral. \u201cThe very idea of truth as something essentially\nnaked,\u201d he says, \u201cis at loggerheads with the Baroque\nidea, so firmly rooted in Italy, that truth is something essentially\nclothed\u201d (Perniola 1995, 145). This corresponds to a\nsensibility that is intermediate between internal feelings and\nexternal things. \u201cThe Italian enigma,\u201d he says,\n\u201clies in the fact that the human component is equipped with an\nexternal emotionality that does not belong to him or her intimately,\nbut in which they nonetheless participate\u201d (Perniola 1995,\n145). To account for this enigmatic experience, the philosopher must\nbecome \u201cthe intermediary, the passage, the transit to something\ndifferent and foreign\u201d (Perniola 1995, 40). Hence,\nphilosophical reading and writing are not activities of an identical\nsubject, but processes of mediation and indeterminacy between self\nand other, and philosophical narrative is an overcoming of their\ndifferences.\n\nThese differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by\ncanceling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or\ndefaced in the course of traversing them. In Ritual\nThinking, Perniola illustrates this process through the concepts\nof transit, the simulacrum, and ritual without myth. Transit derives\nfrom a sense of the simultaneity of the present, where we are\nsuspended in a state of temporariness and indeterminacy, and move\n\u201cfrom the same to the same\u201d; the simulacrum is the result\nof an endless mimesis in which there are only copies of copies\nwithout reference to an original; and ritual without myth is the\nrepetition of patterns of action having no connection to the inner\nlife of a subject or of society. Thus Perniola sees social and\npolitical interaction as repetitive patterns of action having no\ninherent meaning but constituting, nonetheless, an intermediary realm\nwhere oppositions, particularly life and death, are overcome in a\nto-and-fro movement within their space of difference. \n\nTo illustrate these concepts Perniola refers to practices associated\nwith Romanism, particularly Roman religion. \u201cRitual without\nmyth,\u201d he says, \u201cis the very essence of Romanism\u201d\n(Perniola 2001, 81). It is a passage between life and death via their\nmutual simulation, for example, in the labyrinthine movements of the\nritual known as the troiae lusus. These movements, he says,\nmediate between life and death by reversing their pattern of natural\nsuccession, and mediate their difference through actions having no\nintrinsic meaning. Unlike Vattimo's project of constructing meaning\nto overcome historical differences, Perniola's concept of transit\ninto the space of difference is one of \u201cart\u201d in the sense\nof artifice or technique, and is not aimed at a synthesis or\nunification of opposing elements. In this respect, Perniola has an\naffinity with the French postmodernists, who emphasize functional\nrepetition over the creation of meaning. However, as Perniola's\nnotion of ritual without myth illustrates, the functional repetitions\nof social interaction and technology do not disseminate differences,\nbut efface them. This is clear in his account of the ritualized\npassage between life and death, as compared with Baudrillard, who\ncalls for strategies introducing the irreversibility of death into\nthe system of symbolic exchange. In this respect, Perniola's\npostmodernism is strongly aesthetic, and remains, with Vattimo, in\nthe aesthetic and historical dimensions of experience.\n",
