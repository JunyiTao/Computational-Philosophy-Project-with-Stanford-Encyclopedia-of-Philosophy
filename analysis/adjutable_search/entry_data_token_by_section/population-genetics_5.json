    "main_text": "Population-Genetic Models of Evolution || Migration\n3.3 Migration\n\nMigration into or out of a population is a third factor that can\naffect its genetic composition. Obviously, if immigrants are\ngenetically different from the population they are entering, this will\ncause the population\u2019s genetic composition to change. The\nevolutionary importance of migration stems from the fact that many\nspecies are composed of a number of distinct subpopulations, largely\nisolated from each other but connected by occasional migration.\nMigration between subpopulations gives rise to gene flow, which acts\nas a sort of \u2018glue\u2019, limiting the extent to which\nsubpopulations can diverge from each other genetically.\n\nThe simplest model for analysing migration assumes that a given\npopulation receives a number of migrants each generation, but sends\nout no emigrants. Suppose the frequency of the \\(A_1\\)\nallele in the resident population is \\(p\\), and the frequency of\nthe \\(A_1\\) allele among the migrants arriving in the\npopulation is \\(p_m\\). The proportion of\nmigrants coming into the population each generation is \\(m\\)\n(i.e., as a proportion of the resident population.) So post-migration,\nthe frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the population\nis:\n\n\\[\np' = (1 - m) p + mp_m\n\\]\n\n\nThe change in gene frequency across generations is therefore:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Delta p &= p' - p \\\\\n  &= -m(p - p_m)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nTherefore, migration will increase the frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele\nif \\(p_m \\gt p\\), decrease its frequency if \\(p \\gt p_m\\), and leave\nits frequency unchanged if \\(p = p_m\\). We can then derive an equation\ngiving the gene frequency in generation \\(t\\) as a function of its\ninitial frequency and the rate of migration::\n\n\\[\np_t = p_m + (p_0 - p_m)(1 - m)^t\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p_0\\) is the initial frequency of the \\(A_1\\) allele in the\npopulation, i.e., before any migration has taken place. Since the\nexpression \\((1 - m)^t\\) tends towards zero as \\(t\\) grows large, it\nfollows that equilibrium will eventually be reached when \\(p_t =\np_m\\), i.e., when the gene frequency of the migrants equals the gene\nfrequency of the resident population.\n\nThis simple model assumes that migration is the only factor affecting\ngene frequency at the locus, but this is unlikely to be the case. So\nit is necessary to consider how migration will interact with\nselection, drift and mutation (cf. Rice 2004, ch.5). A balance between\nmigration and selection can lead to the maintenance of a deleterious\nallele in a population, in a manner analogous to mutation-selection\nbalance. The interaction between migration and drift is especially\ninteresting. Genetic drift will often lead the separate subpopulations\nof a species to diverge genetically. Migration opposes this\ntrend\u2014it is a homogenising force that tends to make\nsubpopulations more alike. Mathematical models suggest that that even\na fairly small rate of migration will be sufficient to prevent the\nsubpopulations of a species from diverging genetically (Hartl and\nClark 2006). Some theorists have used this to argue against the\nevolutionary importance of group selection, on the grounds that\ngenetic differences between groups, which are essential for group\nselection to operate, are unlikely to persist in the face of\nmigration.\n",
