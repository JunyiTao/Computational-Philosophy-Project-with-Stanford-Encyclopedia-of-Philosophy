This is the view of Gould and Davis\n(2014). They say, \u201cThus, abstract objects exist in two realms:\nthe divine mind and Plato\u2019s heaven \u201d (2014: 61). They\ndecline to say in this particular essay whether mentalism or Platonism\nis true of other sorts of abstract objects (e.g., numbers, states of\naffairs, possible worlds). So what we have in Gould and Davis is an\ninitial sketch of a proposal. They are motivated by bootstrapping\nworries for theistic activism (itself an emanationist view). They\nthink that they can evade bootstrapping objections by having some\nabstracta be identical with divine mental states, and having the\nothers not grounded in God. Their own name for this view is\n\u201cmodified theistic activism\u201d.\n\nIt is perhaps strange that, having started with theistic activism (an\nemanationist view) and its bootstrapping worries, they wind up with a\npart-mentalist view. It would seem that they could have kept some\nabstracta causally grounded in God, and others independent of God (see\n Mixed View 2,\n below). Also, this first Mixed View will face objections of the sort\nfaced by theistic Platonism; viz. that it doesn\u2019t take divine\naseity seriously enough, and that it must read the quantifiers in the\nrelevant religious texts in a restricted manner. Furthermore, it is\npeculiar that propositions wind up as divine mental states, but\nproperties and relations wind up independent of God. One natural\nunderstanding of propositions is that they are structured entities,\nmade up of properties and relations. Another is that they are sets of\npossible worlds. The former understanding seems unavailable to Gould\nand Davis, and the latter would seem to involve having sui\ngeneris primitive possible worlds identical with divine mental\nstates. But at that point, why not just be a thoroughgoing theistic\nmentalist? After all, bootstrapping isn\u2019t a concern for the\nmentalist. Furthermore, bootstrapping worries arise with abstracta\nother than properties. For instance, consider the proposition God\nis omnipotent. In any possible world it exists, it is true. That\nis, it has being true as part of its essence. But\nthen, if God causes it to exist, God causes it to be true. So we have\nthe same sorts of bootstrapping concerns as we did with a property\nlike being omnipotent.\n",
