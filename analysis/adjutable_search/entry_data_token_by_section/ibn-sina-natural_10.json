    "main_text": "Motion || Two Senses of Motion: Traversal and Medial Motion\n3.2 Two Senses of Motion: Traversal and Medial Motion\n\nThus far, Avicenna\u2019s discussion of motion is little more than a\nsophisticated commentary on Aristotle\u2019s definition of motion.\nAvicenna\u2019s analysis goes beyond Aristotle\u2019s inasmuch as\nAvicenna recognizes that \u201cmotion\u201d is an equivocal term\nwith two senses. He identifies these two senses of motion, namely,\ntraversal-motion and medial-motion. As for motion qua traversal, we\nsometimes speak of motion as the whole continuous magnitude stretching\nfrom the initial potential state to the final actual state, such as my\ncomplete walk from my home to the pub. Now at no point does the whole\nof my walk exist in the way that the whole of the spatial distance\ncovered between my house and the pub exists. Indeed, no sooner do I\nstep outside the door of my home on my way to the pub than the initial\npotential state (being in my house) ceases to be and is replaced with\nsome new medial potential state (being on my porch). The same is true\nfor each subsequent state of the walk. Instead, observes Avicenna, the\nwhole and complete walk only ever exists as whole and complete in the\nmind, namely, I remember my being at home and then relate that mental\nimpression with my being in the pub. In other words, motion qua\ntraversal has no extra-mental existence but only ever has a mental\n existence.[9]\n\nIn contrast, medial-motion corresponds with motion inasmuch as it\nexists extra-mentally in the moving body itself. In other words,\nmedial-motion refers to the form that every moving body must have at\nany moment it is in motion in order to explain its being in motion.\nAvicenna describes this form thus:\n\n\nThis is the form of motion existing in the moved thing\u2014namely,\nan intermediacy between the posited starting and end points inasmuch\nas at any limiting point at which it is posited, it did not previously\nexist there nor will it exist there afterwards, unlike [its state at]\nthe points of the two extreme limits (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [6]).\n\n\nWhile Avicenna is careful to avoid using any overtly temporal\nlanguage, like \u201ctime,\u201d \u201cinstant\u201d or\n\u201cnow,\u201d what he has described is motion at an instant as\nopposed to the extended conception of motion captured in\ntraversal-motion. In other words, motion as it exists extra-mentally\noccurs just in case a body exists at some point or in some state for\nonly an instant. For if a body is at some point or in some state for\nonly an instant, then at any subsequent instant it must be at some new\npoint or in some new state, and consequently must have changed or\nundergone motion. Such a position is not to concede that spatial,\nkinematic or temporal magnitudes are composed of points. They are not,\nfor again natural magnitudes are continuous according to Avicenna.\nInstead, Avicenna means that as one can considers a smaller and\nsmaller uniform motion over a smaller and smaller spatial magnitude,\nthe elapsed time of the motion becomes proportionally smaller too. At\nthe limit (\u1e6daraf) of this process of considering\nsmaller and smaller increments of motion, there is motion at an\ninstant, or, more in keeping with Avicenna\u2019s description, at any\npoint you posit the body in the continuum, it was not there before nor\nwill it be there after. \u201cThis,\u201d Avicenna concludes,\n\u201cis, in fact, the first perfection,\u201d which is motion\n(Avicenna, [Ph], 2.1 [6]).\n",
