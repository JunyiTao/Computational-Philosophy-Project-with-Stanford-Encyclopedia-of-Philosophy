Since it is impossible to review them all here, our purpose\nwill be to give a fair idea of them.\n\nThe first important reaction came from philosophers concerned with\nscientific knowledge. Hilan Bensusan and Paulo Souza (1994) thought\nthat Pyrrhonism was an outdated philosophy. In the face of\ncontemporary science, Pyrrhonism would no longer be a viable\nalternative, for it had not the adequate concepts to explain that\nscience. Therefore, the fact that science has evolved in unforeseeable\nways is an objection to neo-Pyrrhonism. Luiz Henrique de Ara\u00fajo\nDutra (1993, 1995, 1996, 1997b), also criticizing Porchat\u2019s\nconception of science, came to propose another skeptical position,\nwhich he called \u201calethic skepticism\u201d. Dutra thought that\nthe metaphysical notion of truth is indispensable to scientific\nresearch. Both held that modern science establishes theories that\ncannot be doubted by the neo-Pyrrhonist. Ot\u00e1vio Bueno has a\nmore sympathetic proposal toward skepticism and develops a\nneo-Pyrrhonist approach to contemporary science by combining it with\nvan Fraassen\u2019s view (Bueno 2015). Neo-Pyrrhonian empiricism\nemphasizes the notion of empirical adequacy.\n\nA second kind of response was given by those who want to develop or\nimprove on basic features of neo-Pyrrhonism. Some, such as\nPl\u00ednio Junqueira Smith (1995b), tried to purify neo-Pyrrhonism\nfrom what still looked like a dogmatic notion. For instance, the idea\nthat dogmatism is a disease and that the skeptic (Pyrrhonist) offers a\nbetter way of life by curing dogmatists of their disease may be mere\nprejudice. Therefore, the skeptical idea of therapy is perhaps\ndogmatic. The notion of common life as used by the neo-Pyrrhonist also\nseems to be an inheritance of Porchat\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the\ncommon view of the world\u201d (Porchat 1975, 1979). The skeptical\nview of the world has an undeniable personal aspect. Waldomiro\nJos\u00e9 da Silva Filho explored, on the one hand, skeptical\ndifficulties in common life neglected by the neo-Pyrrhonist (Silva\nFilho 2015) and, on the other, difficulties in self-knowledge, thereby\ntrying to extend neo-Pyrrhonism to subjects not touched upon by\nPorchat (Silva Filho 2007, 2008).\n\nAnother important discussion intended to correct and improve on\nneo-Pyrrhonism concerns the neo-Pyrrhonist view on truth. Porchat\ndeveloped in an important paper a skeptical doctrine of truth (Porchat\n1995). According to Porchat, once they have divorced from a\nmetaphysical notion of reality, neo-Pyrrhonists can defend a\ncorrespondence theory of truth: what we say and what appears would be\ncorrelated in our experience; it appears that there is a link between\nwhat we say and what appears to us. Eduardo Barrio (2000), however,\nthinks that the only alternative to a neo-Pyrrhonist is to adopt a\ndeflationist theory of truth, like the redundancy theory, and that any\ncorrespondence theory would imply dogmatism.\n\nAn unexpected and important development of neo-Pyrrhonism came from\nphilosophers who were also concerned with political philosophy. They\nwere interested in knowing what would be the skeptical (Pyrrhonian)\nproposal in politics. Porchat (in conversation) has always been very\nclear on this issue, for he holds that the skeptic could have any\npolitical doctrine, including a radical one: from extreme right to\nextreme left. After all, skepticism would not exclude any content of\nphainomena. But most think that not all alternatives are\naccessible to a skeptical position. Renato Lessa (1995) argues that\nthe neo-Pyrrhonist would be a liberal; Paulo Jonas de Lima Piva (2002)\nthinks he could be a social democrat or a socialist; Cicero\nRom\u00e3o Ara\u00fajo (2007, 2008) connects the notion of\nskepticism with the notion of citizenship. This debate opened up a new\nline of research concerning skepticism.\n\nVery recently, an internal criticism of neo-Pyrrhonism emerged and it\ndeserves to be mentioned. Vitor Hirschbruch Schvartz (2015) and Diego\nMachuca (2013a) argue for a rustic version of neo-Pyrrhonism,\naccording to which Pyrrhonists hold no beliefs, and do not stop short\nof all the consequences that one should derive from the force of the\nskeptical attack on dogmatism. A truly skeptical position would\ndestroy all beliefs, whether ordinary or philosophical. Accordingly,\nSchvartz and Machuca see themselves as rustic neo-Pyrrhonists, and do\nnot accept Porchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism with its non-dogmatic\nbeliefs.\n\nBut there have been many external criticisms whose intention is to\nreject neo-Pyrrhonism. Roberto Bolzani Filho developed an incisive\ncriticism of Porchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism. Bolzani (1996, 2003)\nidentified a sort of \u201cnaturalized reason\u201d or some dogmatic\npresuppositions in the idea of a \u201chealthy philosophy\u201d in\nPorchat\u2019s thinking. One could apply to skepticism the same kind\nof argument that the skeptic uses against other philosophies. In the\nend, skepticism would be part of the conflict among philosophies it\ntries to avoid. Bolzani also attempted to show that, despite\nPorchat\u2019s intention, neo-Pyrrhonism is an outdated way of\nphilosophizing. Roberto Hor\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 Pereira (2003)\npresented a Kantian answer to Porchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism. He\nraised a number of difficulties to understand Porchat\u2019s\nconception of phenomena, and argued that an acceptable solution would\ncome only from a transcendental philosophy. These two criticisms, if\nsound, should make one reconsider neo-Pyrrhonism. More recently,\nPereira (2015) came to defend naive realism against Pyrrhonism.\n",
