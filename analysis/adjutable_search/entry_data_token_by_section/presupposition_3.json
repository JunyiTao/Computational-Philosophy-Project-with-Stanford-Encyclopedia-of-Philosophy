    "main_text": "The Frege-Strawson tradition\n2. The Frege-Strawson tradition\n\nThe early literature on presupposition almost exclusively revolved\naround definite descriptions, which are said to presuppose the\nexistence of a unique referent. A problem arises when a definite\ndescription, like the King of France, fails to refer. Russell\n(1905) claimed that sentences like \"The King of France is bald\" are\nfalse because the logical form of definite descriptions contains a\nfalse existential claim. However, Strawson (1950) famously argued\nagainst Russell\u2019s theory by proposing that when a definite description\nfails to refer, the result can be a sentence which lacks a truth\nvalue. Thus presuppositions are understood as definedness conditions,\nnecessary requirements for an expression to have a meaning.\n\nStrawson\u2019s intuition, which can be traced back to Frege (1892), leads\nto the following\n definition:[3]\n\nDefinition 1 (Strawsonian presupposition)\n\nOne sentence presupposes another iff whenever the first is true\nor false, the second is true.\n\nAnother definition that is often used is this:\n\nDefinition 2 (Presupposition via negation)\n\nOne sentence presupposes another iff whenever the first\nsentence is true, the second is true, and whenever the negation of the\nfirst sentence is true, the second sentence is\n true.[4]\n\nhese two definitions are equivalent if negation maps true onto false,\nfalse onto true, and is undefined when its argument is undefined.\nHowever, the second definition is notable in the context of the above\ndiscussion of projection, because it seems to directly encode the\nprojection properties of at least one operator: negation.\nSpecifically, it says that presuppositions are inferences that survive\nembedding under\n negation.[5]\n\nIt is clear that if the above assumptions about presupposition are\nmade, then the presuppositions of a sentence will be the same as the\npresuppositions of the negation of the sentence. But what about\nprojection from embeddings other than negation? A very simple account\nof projection is based on the cumulative hypothesis, first\ndiscussed by Morgan (1969) and Langendoen and Savin (1971). This is\nthe idea that presuppositions always project from embedding, as if\nthere were no effects like cancellation. A trivalent semantics that\nyields this behavior is obtained by using the Weak Kleene\nconnectives (Kleene, 1952). Assume (for all the partial/multivalent\nsemantics given in this article) that for classically valued\narguments, the connectives behave classically. Then Weak Kleene\nconnectives (also known as the Bochvar Internal connectives) are\ndefined as follows:\n\nDefinition 3 (Weak Kleene)\n\nIf any argument of a sentence with a Weak Kleene connective lacks a\nclassical truth value, then the sentence as a whole lacks a truth\nvalue.\n\n\nWeak Kleene fails as a theory of presupposition because it entails\nthat presuppositions project uniformly, whereas in fact they do not.\nAnother system of Kleene\u2019s, the Strong Kleene connectives, does not\nhave this property:\n\nDefinition 4 (Strong Kleene)\n\nIf the classically-valued arguments of a sentence with a Strong Kleene\nconnective would suffice to determine a truth value in standard logic,\nthen the sentence as a whole has that value; otherwise it doesn\u2019t have\na classical value.\n\n\nFor example, in classical logic a conjunction is bound to be false if\none of its conjuncts is false, and therefore the same holds for Strong\nKleene \u201cand\u201d. Similarly, since in classical logic a\ndisjunction must be true if one of its disjuncts is true, the same\nholds for Strong Kleene \u201cor\u201d. We obtain the following\ntruth tables for the main binary connectives:\n\n\nConjunction\n\n\n\n\u03c6\u2009\u2227\u2009\u03c8\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\nt\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\nf\nf\nf\nf \n\n\u272d\n\u272d\nf\n\u272d \n \nDisjunction\n\n\n\n\u03c6\u2009\u2228\u2009\u03c8\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\nt\nt\nt\nt \n\nf\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\n\u272d\nt\n\u272d\n\u272d \n \nImplication\n\n\n\n\u03c6\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c8\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\nt\nt\nf\n\u272d \n\nf\nt\nt\nt \n\n\u272d\nt\n\u272d\n\u272d \n  \n\n\nNow consider the following example:\n\n(12)\nIf there is a knave, then the knave stole the tarts.\n\n\nLet\u2019s ignore all presupposition triggers in (12) save \u201cthe\nknave\u201d, and show that Strong Kleene predicts that the sentence\nas a whole does not presuppose that there is a knave. Using Definition\n1, it suffices to find at least one model where (12) has a classical\ntruth value, but in which there is no knave. This is easy: in such a\nmodel, the antecedent is false, and inspection of the above Strong\nKleene table shows that when the antecedent of a conditional is false,\nthe conditional is true, as would be the case classically. In fact,\nStrong Kleene predicts no presupposition for (12). This is in\ncontradistinction to Weak Kleene, which would fail to give (12) a\nclassical value in knave-less models, and hence predict that (12)\npresupposes the existence of a knave.\n\nThere are other cases where Strong Kleene does predict a\npresupposition, and the presupposition predicted is not what we might\nhave expected. Thus Strong Kleene gives (13a) a classical truth value\nin all models where there is a knave, and in all models where there\nwas trouble. So while we might have expected the presupposition in\n(13b), Strong Kleene predicts the presupposition in\n (13c).[6]\n We will return to this issue shortly.\n\n(13a)\nIf the knave stole the tarts, then there was trouble.\n(13b)\nThere is a knave.\n(13c)\nIf there was no trouble, then there is a knave.\n\n\nMuch of the discussion of partial and multivalent approaches to\npresupposition over the last three decades has centered on the\ntreatment of\n negation.[7]\n Specifically, the issue has been the treatment of cancellation\nexamples like (14).\n\n(14)\nThe tarts were not stolen by the knave: there is no knave.\n\n\nA standard approach is to propose that negation is ambiguous between a\npresupposition-preserving negation and a presupposition-denying\nnegation; see e.g., the discussion by Horn (1985, 1989). The\npresupposition-preserving negation (aka choice negation) we\nhave already seen, and it is found in both the Weak and Strong Kleene\nsystems. The presupposition-denying (or exclusion) negation\nis typically taken to map true to false and false to true, as usual,\nbut also to map an argument lacking a classical value to true. Thus if\n(14) is interpreted in a model where there is no knave, but\n\u201cnot\u201d is understood as a presupposition-denying negation,\nthen \u201cthe tarts were stolen by the knave\u201d would lack a\nclassical value, but \u201cThe tarts were not stolen by the\nknave\u201d, and (14) as a whole, would be true.\n",
