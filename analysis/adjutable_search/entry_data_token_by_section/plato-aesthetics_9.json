    "main_text": "Imitation || Closing assessment\n2.5 Closing assessment\n\nThe Sophist\u2019s references to divine copy-making invite another\nworry. The images that gods produce in their kind of imitation are\nshadows and reflections, and the products of truly bad\nmim\u00easis are to be something worse than that. But what\ncould be metaphysically lower than a shadow? Coming back to the\nRepublic one finds shadows and reflections occupying the\nbottom-most domain of the Divided Line (510a). Where does poetic\nimitation belong on that ranking?\n\nOne can articulate the same worry even remaining with the\nRepublic\u2019s terms. Shadows and reflections belong in the\ncategory of near-ignorance. Imitation works an effect worse than\nignorance, not merely teaching nothing but engendering a perverted\npreference for ignorance over knowledge. Plato often observes that the\nignorant prefer to remain as they are (Symposium 204a), but\nthis turn toward ignorance is different. Why would anyone choose to\nknow less? The theoretical question is also a practical one. If\nmim\u00easis poisons the soul, why do so many people swallow\nit? Plato\u2019s attack on poetry saddles him with an aesthetic problem of\nevil.\n\nRepublic 10 shows signs of addressing the problem with\nlanguage of magic. Socrates begins by promising that insight into\nmim\u00easis operates as a countercharm (595b). People need\ncountercharms because the imitator is a \u201csorcerer\n[go\u00eat\u00eas]\u201d and thereby a deceiver (598d; cf.\n602d). The Republic already said that sorcery robs people of\nknowledge (413b\u2013c). Finally the catalog of Homer\u2019s kinds of\nignorance ends by saying his poetry casts a spell (601b). As the\nEnglish \u201ccharm\u201d does, this noun\nk\u00eal\u00easis can mean \u201cappeal\u201d but also\nsomething fully magical, a spell or conjuration. Poetry works\nmagically to draw in the audience that it then degrades.\n\nReferences to magic serve poorly as explanations but they bespeak the\nneed for explanation. Plato sees that some power must be drawing\npeople to give up both knowledge and the taste for knowledge. But what\nis striking about this deus ex machina that explains poetry\u2019s\nattractiveness is what it does not say. In other dialogues\nthe magic of poetry is attributed to one version or another of divine\ninspiration. Odd that the Republic makes no reference to\ninspiration when dialogues as different as the Apology and\nthe Laws mention it and the Ion and the\nPhaedrus spell out how it works. Odder still, Plato almost\nnever cites imitation and divine inspiration together (the lone\nexception Laws 719c), as if to say that the two are\nincompatible accounts of poetry. Will inspiration play a role\nancillary to imitation, or do the two approaches to poetry have\nnothing to do with one another?\n",
