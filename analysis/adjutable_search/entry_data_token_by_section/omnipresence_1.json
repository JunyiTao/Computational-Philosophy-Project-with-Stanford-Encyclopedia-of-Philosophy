    "main_text": "Power, Knowledge, and Essence\n2. Power, Knowledge, and Essence\n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, God\u2019s presence is to be understood\nin terms of God\u2019s power, knowledge and essence. (In this view he\nfollowed a formula put forth by Peter Lombard (late 11th\nC.\u20131160) in his Sentences, I, xxxvii, 1.) He writes,\n\u201cGod is in all things by his power, inasmuch as all things are\nsubject to his power; he is by his presence in all things, inasmuch as\nall things are bare and open to his eyes; he is in all things by his\nessence, inasmuch as he is present to all as the cause of their\nbeing\u201d (Summa Theologica I, 8, 3). Aquinas attempts to\nmotivate this claim with some illustrations:\n\nBut how he [God] is in other things created by him may be considered\nfrom human affairs. A king, for example, is said to be in the whole\nkingdom by his power, although he is not everywhere present. Again, a\nthing is said to be by its presence in other things which are subject\nto its inspection; as things in a house are said to be present to\nanyone, who nevertheless may not be in substance in every part of the\nhouse. Lastly, a thing is said to be substantially or essentially in\nthat place in which its substance is.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a sense in which a king is present wherever his power\nextends. In any event, Aquinas seems to think so. He distinguishes two\nkinds of being in place: by \u201ccontact of dimensive quantity, as\nbodies are, [and] contact of power\u201d (S.T. I, 8, 2, ad\n1). In Summa contra Gentiles he writes that \u201can\nincorporeal thing is related to its presence in something by its\npower, in the same way that a corporeal thing is related to its\npresence in something by dimensive quantity,\u201d and he adds that\n\u201cif there were any body possessed of infinite dimensive\nquantity, it would have to be everywhere. So if there were an\nincorporeal being possessed of infinite power, it must be\neverywhere\u201d (SCG III, 68, 3). So the first aspect of\nGod\u2019s presence in things is his having power over them. The\nsecond aspect is having every thing present to him, having\neverything \u201cbare and open to his eyes\u201d or being known to\nhim. The third feature, that God is present in things by his essence,\nis glossed as his being the cause of their being, (although Ross Inman\n(2021) argues that a fuller account within the Christian tradition\ntreats the role of essence here as deriving explanatorily from a prior\nattribute of ubiquity).\n\nThis way of understanding God\u2019s presence by reference to his\npower and his knowledge treats the predicate \u2018is present\u2019\nas applied to God as analogical with its application to\nordinary physical things. (For a fuller explanation of analogical\npredication, see\n Medieval Theories of Analogy.)\n As applied to God, \u2018is present\u2019 is neither univocal (used\nwith the same meaning as in ordinary contexts) nor equivocal (used\nwith an unrelated meaning). Rather, its meaning can be explained by\nreference to its ordinary sense: God is present at a place just in\ncase there is a physical object that is at that place and God has\npower over that object, knows what is going on in that object, and God\nis the cause of that object\u2019s existence. Nicholas Everitt (2010,\np. 86) objects to this analogical approach, stating that \u201cif\nthis is how omnipresence is interpreted, one might well think that it\nwould be clearer to say straightforwardly that God is not omnipresent\nat all,\u201d and he cites Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz (2002,\np. 41)) as agreeing with him. But Hoffman and Rosenkrantz in the cited\npassage merely say that \u201cthere is no literal sense in\nwhich [God] could be omnipresent,\u201d which leaves it open that\nthere is an analogical sense in which God is omnipresent. Hud Hudson\n(2009) also denies that God\u2019s presence is analogical, but that\nis because he thinks that there is a literal way in which God is\npresent everywhere. We will consider Hudson\u2019s proposal in\nSection 5.\n\nThis account of omnipresence has the consequence that, strictly\nspeaking, God is only present where some physical thing is located.\nPerhaps, however, this is exactly what the medievals had intended.\nAnselm says, for example, that \u201cthe supreme Nature is more\nappropriately said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it is in all\nexisting things, than in this sense, namely that it is merely in all\nplaces\u201d (Monologion, 23).\n",
