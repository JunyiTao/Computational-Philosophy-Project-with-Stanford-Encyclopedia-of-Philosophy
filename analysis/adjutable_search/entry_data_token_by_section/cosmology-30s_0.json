    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nOne of the most vigorous philosophical debates of the century broke\nout among cosmologists during the 1930s and 1940s. At the peak of the\ndebate, 1936\u201337, many of the most prominent scientists in\nBritain, as well as several leading philosophers of science, had\ngotten themselves publicly involved. Their arguments, attacks and\nrebuttals were chronicled in many of the leading scientific journals,\nincluding a special edition of the foremost general scientific\njournal, Nature, devoted entirely to philosophical arguments\nand counter-arguments.\n\nMethodology was the central issue of the debate, although metaphysical\nquestions also arose, particularly those concerning the actual reality\nof certain structures and forces imputed to the Universe by the new\ncosmological theories and observations. But in the end, methodology\nwas the real goad spurring on most of the participants.\n\nAt bottom, there were just two opposing positions in the debate, each\nof which comprised a two-point stance. On one side were those\nscientists who had their roots mostly in the experimental side of\nnatural science. To them, there was one and only one legitimate method\nfor science. Theory construction, they believed, involved two\nclosely-linked steps. First, one began from the empirical\nobservations, that is, from measurements, manipulations,\nexperiments, whose results were evident to the human senses; this is\nclassic empiricist epistemology. Observational results would\nthen suggest possible hypotheses to examine via further empirical\ntesting. When enough data concerning the hypothesis had been gathered,\nlogical generalization could be carried out, thereby\nproducing a theory; this is classic inductivist logic.\n\nOpposing these inductive-empiricist scientists were those whose roots\nwere mostly in the theoretical side of natural science, most\nespecially mathematical physics. To them, there was another, more\nlogically sound, method to construct theories. First,\nhypotheses could be generated in any fashion, although most\nbelieved that imagining hypotheses which were based upon very general,\nvery reasonable concepts\u2014that the Universe\u2019s physical\nprocesses had simple mathematical descriptions, for example\u2014was\nthe best place to begin; this is classic rationalist\nepistemology. Once the hypothesis had been generated, strict\nanalytical reasoning could be used to make predictions about\nobservations; this is classic deductivist logic. Scientists\nwho held this view came to be called\nhypothetico-deductivists; their views about both hypothesis\ngeneration and deductive predictions were each strongly opposed by the\ninductive-empiricists.\n\nPart of the controversy may be laid to the fact that cosmology was a\nnew science, and disputes about methodology in new sciences are not\nrare in the history of the sciences. What is rare about this case,\nhowever, is the vigor, sometimes even bitterness, with which the\nphilosophical controversy was waged. Another reason for the\ncontroversy lies in the fact that cosmology is a data-poor science:\nobservations are hard-won and rare, and they frequently must be run\nthrough elaborate theoretical manipulations and corrections in order\nto make sense at all. With a paucity of data results, scientists must\nrely upon philosophical argument to undergird their views about how\nthe scientific work should be done.\n\nOne final feature of the debate must be noted. The participants are\nalmost universally scientists, and not philosophers. Yet this does not\nmuch affect the level of philosophical thinking going on; these\nscientists knew their philosophy well, and they wielded\nphilosophy\u2019s weapons and defenses with great skill. In the end,\ntheir debate shaped cosmology into the science we know today.\n\nIt will be useful to look briefly at the history of cosmology leading\nup to the debate.\n",
