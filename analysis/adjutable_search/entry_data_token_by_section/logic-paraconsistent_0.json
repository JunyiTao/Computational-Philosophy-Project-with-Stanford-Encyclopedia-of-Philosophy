    "main_text": "Paraconsistency\n1. Paraconsistency\n\nA logic is paraconsistent iff its logical consequence\nrelation \\((\\vDash\\), either semantic or proof theoretic) is not\nexplosive. Paraconsistency is a property of a consequence relation.\nThe argument ex contradictione quodlibet (ECQ) is\nparaconsistently invalid: in general, it is not the case that \\(A\\),\n\\(\\neg A \\vDash B\\).\n\nThe role often played by the notion of consistency in orthodox logics,\nnamely, the most basic requirement that any theory must meet, is\nrelaxed to the notion of coherence: no theory can include\nevery sentence whatsoever if it is to be considered tenable. Simple\nconsistency of a theory (no contradictions) is a special case of\nabsolute consistency, or non-triviality (not every sentence\nis a part of the theory). As we will see below, many paraconsistent\nlogics do validate the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), \\(\\vDash \\neg(A\n\\wedge \\neg A)\\), even though they invalidate ECQ.\n\nBeyond the basic, definitional requirement that a paraconsistent\nconsequence relation be non-explosive, there is a huge divergence of\nparaconsistent logics. At this stage of development, well into the\ntwenty-first century, it seems fair to say that\n\u2018paraconsistency\u2019 does not single out one particular\napproach to logic, but is rather a property that some logics have and\nothers do not (like, say, compactness, or multiple conclusions).\n",
