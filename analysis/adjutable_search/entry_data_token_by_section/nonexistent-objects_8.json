Problems with Belief in Nonexistent Objects\n\nThe foregoing considerations suggested that the claim that there are\nnonexistent objects has considerable explanatory force. Why, then, is\nthis claim not generally accepted but, rather to the contrary, so\ncontroversial? Is the reason just, as Meinong has put it, \u201ca\nprejudice in favor of the actual\u201d? \u2014 Although ontological\nprejudices may play a role, there are also some good reasons for\nreservations (to put it very carefully).\n\nEven in Meinong\u2019s own writings, there are (roughly) two versions\nof the theory, the original one and a later, revised one. In what\nfollows, we will refer to the original Meinongian object\ntheory by means of the abbreviation \u201cMOT\\(^o\\)\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the most basic principle of MOT\\(^o\\) is the so-called\n\u201cprinciple of independence\u201d, which says,\nliterally: So-being is independent from being (see Meinong\n1959). Ignoring, for the sake of simplicity, Meinong\u2019s\nparticular use of the term \u201cbeing\u201d, we can paraphrase this\nprinciple as: So-being is independent from existence.\n\nThe \u201cso-being\u201d of an object is the totality of the\nobject\u2019s properties apart from the object\u2019s existence or\nnon-existence. The principle of independence says, thus, that an\nobject may have any properties whatsoever, independently of whether\nthe object exists or not. For instance, the (nonexistent) golden\nmountain literally is golden and a mountain; the round square\nliterally is round and a square.\n\nTo every single property and to every set of properties, there is a\ncorresponding object, either an existent or a nonexistent one. Thus,\nthere is, for instance, an object that has the property of being round\nas its sole property; one might call it \u201cthe object\nround\u201d, or simply \u201cround\u201d. There\nis also an object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nproperty (the object blue, or blue, for short).\nFurthermore, there is an object that has the property of being round\nand the property of being blue, and no other properties (the object\nround and blue); and so forth.\n\nIn the notation of classical logic extended with definite descriptions\nof the form \\(\\iota x\\phi(x)\\), the object that has the\nproperty of being blue as its sole property may be represented by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\)\u201d[20]\n (where \u201c\\(B\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis blue\u201d),\nthe object that has the property of being blue and the property of\nbeing round as its sole properties by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B \\vee F = R)\\)\u201d (where\n\u201c\\(R\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis round\u201d), and so\nforth.\n\nThe object blue is not identical with the\nproperty of being blue; neither is it identical with the\nset that contains the property of being blue as its sole\nmember. Neither is the object round and blue identical with\nthe set of the property of being blue and the property of being round.\nThe property of being blue is not itself blue, the property of being\nround is not itself round. Analogous considerations hold for sets of\nproperties: sets have neither colors nor shapes. But the object\nblue is blue, and the object round is round, and so\nforth.\n\nOne might wish to ask: Isn\u2019t it impossible that there exists an\nobject that has the property of being blue as its sole\nproperty? Isn\u2019t it necessarily the case that every colored\nobject also has some particular shape, some particular size, is made\nof some particular material, and so forth?\n\nThe Meinongian answer to this question is as follows: It is indeed\nimpossible that such an object exists! Therefore, the object\nblue is not only nonexistent but even necessarily\nnonexistent. Of course, the same holds for the object round,\nthe object red and round, and infinitely many other objects\nas well. Every existing object has infinitely many\nproperties. Every existing object is a completely determined\n(or, in short: a complete) object. Objects like blue\nand round and blue are incompletely determined (or,\nin short: incomplete)\n objects.[21]\n\nIncomplete objects are necessarily nonexistent. They are, in this\nsense, impossible objects (even though their properties may\nnot be contradictory). It should be noted, however, that not every\ncomplete object exists. Consider, for instance, the object that looks\nexactly like me except that it has green eyes instead of blue ones.\nLet\u2019s assume that this object (my nonexistent green-eyed\ncounterpart) has all the properties that I have except for those that\nare entailed by the difference in eye color, given the actual laws of\nnature. My nonexistent green-eyed counterpart is completely determined\nand nevertheless does not exist. But, in contrast to blue,\nthis counterpart could exist, i.e., it is a possible\nnonexistent\n object.[22]\n\nUnfortunately, however, MOT\\(^o\\) has a number of paradoxical\nconsequences. Bertrand Russell, Meinong\u2019s most famous critic,\nput forward two objections against\n MOT\\(^o\\).[23]\n The first objection goes as follows: According to MOT\\(^o\\),\nthere is an object that is both round and square, but such an object\nis \u201capt to infringe the law of contradiction\u201d, since it\nwould be both round and not round (Russell 1973c, 107).\n\nMeinong perhaps could have replied to this objection that the object\ncalled \u201cthe round square\u201d has the properties of being\nround and being square, but not the property of being not round, and\nthus the round square does not infringe the law of contradiction (but\nonly the geometrical law that everything that is square is not round).\nSuch a reply, however, would have been a bit beside the point, since\nit is clear that, according to the principles of MOT\\(^o\\),\nthere is an object that is both round and not round (and evidently the\nobject that Russell had in mind was of this sort). Indeed, Meinong did\nnot deny that the round square infringes the law of contradiction.\nInstead, he replied to Russell\u2019s first objection that the law of\ncontradiction holds for existent objects only. Objects that are both\nround and not round, however, are necessarily nonexistent.\n\nRussell accepted this reply but forged a second objection that could\nnot be dismissed in the same vein. Russell argues that since it is a\nprinciple of MOT\\(^o\\) that to every set of properties\nthere is a corresponding object and since existence is treated as a\nproperty within MOT\\(^o\\), there must be an object that has\nexactly the following three properties: being golden, being a\nmountain, and being existent. If \u201c\\(G\\)\u201d stands for\n\u201cis golden\u201d, \u201c\\(M\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis\na mountain\u201d and \u201c\\(\\rE!\\)\u201d stands for \u201cis\nexistent\u201d, this object is denoted by\n\u201c\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = G \\vee F = M \\vee F = \\rE!)\\)\u201d. Thus, it follows from the principles of\nMOT\\(^o\\) that there is an existent object that is\ngolden and a mountain. But it is an empirical fact that no golden\nmountain exists. Given the (apparently trivial) assumption that\n\u201c\\(b\\) is existent\u201d is equivalent with\n\u201c\\(b\\) exists\u201d, this is a contradiction.\n\nA further paradox seems to arise from the incompleteness of many\nMeinongian objects:\n\nThe object blue (i.e.,\n\\(\\iota x\\forall F(Fx \\equiv F = B)\\), according to MOT\\(^o)\\) has the property of being\nblue as its sole property. (Theorem of MOT\\(^o)\\)\nThe object blue has exactly one property. (1)\nThe object blue has the property of having exactly one\nproperty. (2)\nThe property of being blue is not identical with the property of\nhaving exactly one property.\nThus, blue has (at least) two properties, namely the\nproperty of being blue and the property of having exactly one\nproperty. (1, 3, 4)\nThus, blue has exactly one property and blue has\n(at least) two properties. (2, 5)\n\n\nFurthermore, it seems that many Meinongian objects do not only\ninfringe laws of logic and geometry, but also intuitively plausible\nprinciples like \u201cIf something is round, it occupies some region\nin space\u201d and \u201cIf something is a mountain, it is\naccessible to the senses\u201d. It seems that having a particular\nshape entails occupying a region in space and that being a mountain\nentails accessibility to the senses (in principle). According to\nMOT\\(^o\\), the round square is round and the golden mountain is\na mountain, but obviously neither the round square nor the golden\nmountain occupies any region in space and neither of them is\naccessible to the senses.\n\nAnother strange consequence of MOT\\(^o\\) is the following: If an\nobject comes into existence, all that happens is that the object turns\nfrom a nonexistent into an existent one. Analogously, if an object\ngoes out of existence, all that happens is that the object turns from\nan existent again into a nonexistent one. Apart from this, neither the\nobject in question nor the world as a whole changes in any way. For\ninstance, when I cease to exist, all that happens is that I will again\nbe nonexistent (as it was from the beginning of time to 1966). In all\nother respects, I will stay just the same. Maybe such a thought is\npotentially comforting for those who love me, but it is surely at odds\nwith our normal understanding of coming into existence and passing\naway.\n",
