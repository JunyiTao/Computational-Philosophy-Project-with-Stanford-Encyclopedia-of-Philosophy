    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Is QBism too Subjective?\n2.5 Is QBism too Subjective?\n\nThe QBist approach to quantum theory is often criticized as too\nsubjective in its treatment of quantum states, measurement outcomes,\nand probabilities.\n\nMany people assume a wave-function or state vector represents a\nphysical quantum state. On this assumption a quantum state is\nontic\u2014a fundamental element of reality obeying the quantum\ndynamics that underlies classical dynamical laws. Bacciagaluppi (2014)\nurges QBists to accept this approach to dynamics even while\nmaintaining a subjectivist or pragmatist interpretation of\nprobability. But doing so would undercut the QBist account of\ndiscontinuous change of quantum state on measurement as simply\ncorresponding to epistemic updating.\n\nMost people take it for granted that a competently performed quantum\nmeasurement procedure has a unique, objective outcome. QBists deny\nthis, assimilating a measurement outcome to an agent\u2019s personal\nexperience\u2014including her experience of another agent\u2019s\nverbal report of his outcome. QBists take a measurement outcome to be\npersonal to the agent whose action elicited it. This tenet is key both\nto QBist denial that quantum phenomena involve any nonlocal influence\n(Fuchs, Mermin and Schack 2014) and to the QBist (DeBrota, Fuchs and\nSchack 2020) resolution of the paradox of Wigner\u2019s friend (see\nthe entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics).\n But their notions of experience and agency are broad enough to\nencompass personal experiences of agents other than individual,\nconscious humans.\n\nBy rejecting the objective authority of observation reports QBists\nchallenge what many have considered a presupposition of the scientific\nmethod. This rejection also threatens to undercut the standard\npersonalist argument (see entry on\n Bayesian epistemology,\n \u00a76.2.F) that the opinions of agents with very different prior\ndegrees of belief will converge after they have accumulated sufficient\ncommon evidence.\n\nQBists consider a subjective view of quantum probability a core\ncommitment of the view, even when that probability is\n1 (Caves, Fuchs and Schack 2007). But Stairs (2011)\nand others have argued that QBist strategies for resolving conceptual\nproblems associated with non-locality may be co-opted by a qualified\nobjectivist about quantum probabilities.\n\nQBists identify probability 1 with an individual\nagent\u2019s subjective certainty, in contrast to the objective\ncertainty EPR took to entail the existence of a physical quantity\nwhose value could be predicted with probability 1.\nStairs (2011) referred to developments of David Lewis\u2019s (1986:\nAppendix C) best systems analysis as providing an alternative notion\nof objective probability in which this entailment fails (see entry on\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.6). So QBist subjectivism about probability is not necessary\nto block the EPR inference to an element of reality (or beable, to use\nBell\u2019s term) grounding the objective certainty of Bob\u2019s\ndistant measurement outcome on his component of a non-separable system\nfollowing Alice\u2019s measurement on her component, thereby\nundercutting Bell\u2019s proof that quantum theory is not locally\ncausal.\n",
