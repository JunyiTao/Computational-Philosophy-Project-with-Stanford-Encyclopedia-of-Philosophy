    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions about Genetics || What Is a \u201cGene\u201d?\n2.2 What Is a \u201cGene\u201d?\n\nNo concept is more central to genetics than the \u201cgene\u201d.\nAnd yet, the earliest philosophical examinations of genetics quickly\nuncovered the fact that it was by no means clear that the gene from\nclassical genetics was the same thing as the gene from molecular\ngenetics. Subsequent attention to genetics only compounded the puzzle.\nIn the late 1970s, a series of discoveries complicated the simple\nrelationship between a single, uninterrupted sequence of DNA and its\npolypeptide, protein product. Overlapping genes were discovered\n(Barrell et al. 1976); such genes were considered overlapping because\ntwo different amino acid chains might be read from the same stretch of\nnucleic acids by starting from different points on the DNA sequence.\nAnd split genes were found (Berget et al. 1977; Chow et al. 1977). In\ncontrast to the hypothesis that a continuous nucleic acid sequence\ngenerated an amino acid chain, it became apparent that stretches of\nDNA were often split between coding regions (exons) and non-coding\nregions (introns). The distinction between exons and introns became\neven more complicated when alternative splicing was discovered the\nfollowing year (Berk and Sharp 1978). A series of exons could be\nspliced together in a variety of ways, thus generating a variety of\nmolecular products. Discoveries such as overlapping genes, split\ngenes, and alternative splicing made it clear that what counted as a\ngene was by no means straightforward even if focus was confined to\nmolecular genetics (Griffiths and Stotz 2013; Rheinberger and\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2017; entry:\n molecular biology).\n\nPhilosophers responded to these genetic discoveries in different\nways\u2014by proposing multiple gene concepts, or by trying to unify\nthe disparate phenomena under a single gene concept. Lenny\nMoss\u2019s distinction between Gene-P and Gene-D is a classic\nexample of the multiple gene concepts approach (Moss 2002). Gene-P\nembraced an instrumental preformationism; it was defined by its\nrelationship to a phenotype. In contrast, Gene-D referred to a\ndevelopmental resource; it was defined by its molecular sequence. An\nexample will help to distinguish the two: When one talked about\n\u201cthe gene for cystic fibrosis\u201d, the Gene-P concept was\nbeing utilized; the concept referred to the ability to track the\ntransmission of this gene from generation to generation as an\ninstrumental predictor of cystic fibrosis, without being contingent on\nknowing the causal pathway between the particular sequence of DNA and\nthe ultimate phenotypic disease. The Gene-D concept, in contrast,\nreferred instead to just one developmental resource (i.e., the\nmolecular sequence) involved in the complex development of the\ndisease, which interacted with a host of other such resources\n(proteins, RNA, a variety of enzymes, etc.) (entry:\n gene).\n (For other examples of multiple gene concepts, see Fox Keller 2002;\nBaetu 2011; Griffiths and Stotz 2013).\n\nA second philosophical approach for conceptualizing the gene involved\nrethinking a single, unified gene concept that captured the molecular\ncomplexities. For example, Eva Neumann-Held claimed that a\n\u201cprocess molecular gene concept\u201d embraced the\ncomplications; on her unified view, the term \u201cgene\u201d\nreferred to \u201cthe recurring process that leads to the temporally\nand spatially regulated expression of a particular polypeptide\nproduct\u201d (Neumann-Held 1999). Returning to the case of cystic\nfibrosis, a process molecular gene for an individual without the\ndisease referred to one of a variety of transmembrane ion-channel\ntemplates along with all the non-genetic influences on gene\nexpression, involved in the generation of the normal polypeptide\nproduct. And so cystic fibrosis arose when a particular stretch of the\nDNA sequence was missing from this process (entry:\n molecular genetics).\n (For additional examples of gene-concept unification, see Falk 2001;\nPortin and Wilkins 2017.)\n",
