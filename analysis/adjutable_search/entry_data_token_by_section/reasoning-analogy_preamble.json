    "main_text": "\n\nAn analogy is a comparison between two objects, or systems of\nobjects, that highlights respects in which they are thought to be\nsimilar. Analogical reasoning is any type of thinking that\nrelies upon an analogy. An analogical argument is an\nexplicit representation of a form of analogical reasoning that cites\naccepted similarities between two systems to support the conclusion\nthat some further similarity exists. In general (but not always), such\narguments belong in the category of ampliative reasoning, since their\nconclusions do not follow with certainty but are only supported with\nvarying degrees of strength. However, the proper characterization of\nanalogical arguments is subject to debate (see\n \u00a72.2).\n\nAnalogical reasoning is fundamental to human thought and, arguably, to\nsome nonhuman animals as well. Historically, analogical reasoning has\nplayed an important, but sometimes mysterious, role in a wide range of\nproblem-solving contexts. The explicit use of analogical arguments,\nsince antiquity, has been a distinctive feature of scientific,\nphilosophical and legal reasoning. This article focuses primarily on\nthe nature, evaluation and justification of analogical arguments.\nRelated topics include\n metaphor,\n models in science, and\n precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.\n",
