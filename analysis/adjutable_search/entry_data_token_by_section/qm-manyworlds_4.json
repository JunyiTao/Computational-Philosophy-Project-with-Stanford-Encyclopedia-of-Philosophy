    "main_text": "Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience || The Quantum State of a Macroscopic Object\n3.1 The Quantum State of a Macroscopic Object\n\nThe basis for the correspondence between the quantum state (the wave\nfunction) of the Universe and our experience is the description that\nphysicists give in the framework of standard quantum theory for\nobjects composed of elementary particles. Elementary particles of the\nsame kind are identical (see the elaborate discussion in the entry on\n identity and individuality in quantum theory).\n The essence of an object is the (massively entangled) quantum state\nof its particles and not the particles themselves. One quantum state\nof a set of elementary particles might be a cat and another state of\nthe same particles might be a small table. An object is a spatial\npattern of such a quantum state. Clearly, we cannot now write down an\nexact wave function of a cat. We know, to a reasonable approximation,\nthe wave function of the elementary particles that constitute a\nnucleon. The wave function of the electrons and the nucleons that\ntogether make up an atom is known with even better precision. The wave\nfunctions of molecules (i.e. the wave functions of the ions and\nelectrons out of which molecules are built) are well studied. A lot is\nknown about biological cells, and physicists are making progress in\nthe quantum representation of biological systems Cao et. al 2020. Out\nof cells we construct various tissues and then the whole body of a cat\nor a table. So, let us denote the quantum state of a macroscopic\nobject constructed in this way \\(\\ket{\\Psi}_\\object.\\)\n\nIn our construction \\(\\ket{\\Psi}_\\object\\) represents an object in a\ndefinite state and position. According to the definition of a world we\nhave adopted, in each world the cat is in a definite state: either\nalive or dead. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s experiment with the cat leads\nto a splitting of worlds even before opening the box. Note that in the\ncentered world approach, the superposed Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat\nis a member of the single world of the observer before she opens the\nsealed box with the cat. The observer directly perceives the facts\nrelated to the experiment and deduces that the cat is in a\nsuperposition.\n\nFormally, the quantum state of an object which consists of \\(N\\)\nparticles is defined in \\(3N\\) dimensional configuration space, see\nAlbert 1996, 2015. However, in order to understand our experience, it\nis crucial to make a connection to \\(3\\) dimensional space, see Stoica\n2019. We only experience objects defined in \\(3D\\)-space. The causes\nof our experience are interactions, and in nature there are only local\ninteractions in three spatial dimensions. These interactions can be\nexpressed as couplings to some macroscopic variables of the object\ndescribed by quantum waves well localized in \\(3D\\)-space, which are\nin a product with the relative variables state of the object (like\nentangled electrons in atoms) and other parts of the object, see\nVaidman 2019 (Sec. 5.6). Another way to bridge between the wave\nfunction of the object and our experience of that object is the\nthree-dimensional picture of the density of the wave function of\nmolecules of the macroscopic object which has the familiar geometrical\nform of the object. Note that in some other interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, similar densities are given additional ontological\nsignificance (Allori et al. 2014.)\n",
