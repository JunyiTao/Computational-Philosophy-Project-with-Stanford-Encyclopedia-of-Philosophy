    "main_text": "Anti-psychiatry, Feminist Theory, Post- and Critical- Psychiatry, Neurodiversity and Identity Politics || Identity Politics\n11. Future Prospects\n\nWhere might we expect philosophical work on mental disorder to go from\nhere? One issue must be what role or roles remain for conceptual\napproaches and commonsense psychology, and for the related tug of war\nover who decides mental health \u2013 modern science, and the\nmerciless dictates of evolutionary biology, or some richer eudaemonic\nvision? Even granted the authority to determine ideals of mental\nhealth, philosophers would encounter hard questions. How to relinquish\nevaluative thinking in view of liberal traditions around\nresponsibility and self identity? How generously to attribute normalcy\nand diversity, rather than deficiency, and how to navigate at the\nboundary of disorder and risk? New ways to understand, verify and\nameliorate mental disorders together with big data on their incidence\nand circumstances, and the challenges introduced by the new\nhyperconnectedness and biomedicalization of society can only augment\nand extend such questions, perhaps in directions barely dreamed\nof.\n",
