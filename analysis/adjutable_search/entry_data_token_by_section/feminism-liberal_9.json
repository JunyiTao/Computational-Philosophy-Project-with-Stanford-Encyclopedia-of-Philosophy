    "main_text": "Classical-Liberal Feminism || Anti-Discrimination Law and Preferential Treatment\n2.4 Anti-Discrimination Law and Preferential Treatment\n\nClassical-liberal feminism requires same treatment of women and men\nunder just law. This means that sex discrimination by the state, for\nexample when the state functions as an employer, is impermissible\n(Block 1991: 102; Epstein 2002: 34; Warnick 2003: 1608). But\nclassical-liberal feminists oppose laws that prohibit discrimination\nagainst women by nonstate actors, for example in employment,\neducation, public accommodations, or associations (McElroy 1991b:\n22\u201323; Epstein 2002). They hold that the interaction of citizens\nshould be subject to state control only to the extent necessary to\nprotect citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference.\nBusinesses violate citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference\nif they steal from their customers or employees; associations violate\nit if they extort their members; colleges violate it if they kidnap\nstudents. But businesses do not violate this right if they refuse to\ndo business with women, pay women less for the same work, or create a\nworking environment that is hostile to them because of their sex.\nPrivate educational institutions do not violate this right if they\nrefuse to educate girls or women, offer them an inferior education, or\ncreate a learning environment that is hostile to them because of their\nsex. Business and professional associations do not violate this right\nif they refuse to admit women as members or make them feel unwelcome\nbecause of their sex.\n\nClassical-liberal feminism, as described here, clearly implies\nrejection of the legal prohibition against private discrimination in\nemployment, education, public accommodations, and associations. But in\nthe literature one finds a range of views. Some categorically reject\nany legal protection against private discrimination (Taylor 1992: 62).\nOthers accept basic protections such as those afforded in U.S. law by\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nand Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972; but reject more\nrobust protections, such as non-remedial affirmative action or\ncomparable worth (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 179; see also\n107\u2013108).\n\nClassical-liberal feminism holds that private businesses, educational\ninstitutions, and associations are free to give or withhold\npreferential treatment to women. But the state may not treat women\npreferentially because the state must treat citizens the same\nregardless of sex. Nor may the state require that private businesses,\neducational institutions, or associations treat women preferentially.\nThis is because, on the classical-liberal feminist view, failure to\ntreat women preferentially is not a violation of anyone\u2019s right\nagainst coercive interference. Examples of preferential treatment\nunder the law, which classical-liberal feminists oppose, include\naffirmative action in employment and education (Lehrman 1997: 25),\ncomparable worth (Paul 1989) and advantages for women in the legal\ntreatment of custody and domestic violence (Simon 2002).\n\nWhile classical-liberal feminists resist state remedies for private\ndiscrimination against women, they also hold that such discrimination\nis not currently a serious problem in countries like the United\nStates. In addition, they argue,\n\n\neven where discrimination may exist, we find little, if any, evidence\nthat expanded government intervention would serve any useful purpose.\n(Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii)\n\n\nand speculate that freer markets would make whatever discrimination\ncurrently takes place even more rare (McElroy 2002b, 187).\n",
