    "main_text": "Constructivism About Moral Principles || Other Varieties\n5.3 Other Varieties\n\nIt is worth mentioning that conventionalism, the view that moral\nclaims are based on social convention, often uses the metaphor of\nconstruction: it is defended as the view that moral truths are\nconstructed by the actual agreement of some groups within specific\ntraditions (Wong 2008).\n\nOther varieties of metaethical constructivism are emerging, building\nupon the insights of philosophers other than Kant: the Spinozian\nvariety (Zuck 2015), the Smithian variety (Stueber 2016), the Hegelian\nvariety (Westphal 2013; Rockmore 2016; Laitinen 2016, and the\nNietzschean variety (Katsafanas 2013; Silk 2015). Not all of them\nclaim a place in metaethics, independently of existing forms of\nrealism and antirealism. But they all find that the notion of\nconstruction is a distinctive explanatory device for capturing the\nobjectivity and normativity of ethical truths.\n",
