    "main_text": "Cosmic Landscape, Soul Landscape: From Heavenly Circuits to Human Return\n7. The Poet\n\n\nIn addition to his philosophical writing, Ibn Gabirol is\nauthor to an extensive corpus of Hebrew poems (generally categorized\ninto \u201creligious\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d poems) which it\nis beyond the scope of this entry to\n address.[33]\n\n\nAside from Ibn Gabirol's technical prowess as a poet, it is\nworth noting that Ibn Gabirol's own self-conception as a poet (a\ntheme overtly and self-referentially explored in many of his poems)\nopens important philosophical questions about the nature of language,\nselfhood and divinity. In, for example, drawing parallels between\nGod's act of creation (by Word), and the poet's /\nphilosopher's own act of writing, Ibn Gabirol arguably invites us\nto reconceptualize human subjectivity, the sacred, and the relationship\nbetween philosophical theory-building and imagino-poetic play.\n",
