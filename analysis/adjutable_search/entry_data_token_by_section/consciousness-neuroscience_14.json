    "main_text": "Neurobiological Theories of Consciousness || The Global Neuronal Workspace\n3.1 The Global Neuronal Workspace\n\nOne explanation of generic consciousness invokes the global\nneuronal workspace. Bernard Baars first proposed the global\nworkspace theory as a cognitive/computational model (Baars 1988), but\nwe will focus on the neural version of Stanislas Dehaene and\ncolleagues: a state is conscious when and only when it (or its\ncontent) is present in the global neuronal workspace making the state\n(content) globally accessible to multiple systems including\nlong-term memory, motor, evaluational, attentional and perceptual\nsystems (Dehaene, Kerszberg, & Changeux 1998; Dehaene &\nNaccache 2001; Dehaene et al. 2006). Notice that the previous\ncharacterization does not commit to whether it is phenomenal or access\nconsciousness that is being defined. \n\nAccess should be understood as a relational notion:\n\nA system X accesses content from system Y iff X\nuses that content in its computations/processing.\n\nThe accessibility of information is then defined as its\npotential access by other systems. Dehaene (Dehaene et al. 2006)\nintroduces a threefold distinction: (1) neural states that carry\ninformation that is not accessible (subliminal information);\n(2) states that carry information that is accessible but not accessed\n(not in the workspace; preconscious information); and (3)\nstates whose information is accessed by the workspace\n(conscious information) and is globally accessible to other\nsystems. So, a necessary and sufficient condition for a state\u2019s\nbeing conscious rather than not is the access of a state or content by\nthe workspace, making that state or content accessible to other\nsystems. Hence, only states in (3) are conscious.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Global Neuronal\nWorkspace\n\nFigure Legend: The top figure provides a neural architecture for the\nworkspace, indicating the systems that can be involved. The lower\nfigure sets the architecture within the six layers of the cortex\nspanning frontal and sensory areas, with emphasis on neurons in layers\n2 and 3.

It postulates a cortical structure that involves\nworkspace neurons with long-range connections linking systems:\nperceptual, mnemonic, attentional, evaluational and motoric.\n\nWhat is the global workspace in neural terms? Long-range workspace\nneurons within different systems can constitute the workspace, but\nthey should not necessarily be identified with the workspace.\nA subset of workspace neurons becomes the workspace when they\nexemplify certain neural properties. What determines which workspace\nneurons constitute the workspace at a given time is the activity of\nthose neurons given the subject\u2019s current state. The workspace\nthen is not a rigid neural structure but a rapidly changing neural\nnetwork, typically only a proper subset of all workspace neurons.\n\nConsider then a neural population that carries content p and is\nconstituted by workspace neurons. In virtue of being workspace\nneurons, the content p is accessible to other systems, but it\ndoes not yet follow that the neurons then constitute the global\nworkspace. A further requirement is that workspace neurons are (1) put\ninto an active state that must be sustained so that (2) the activation\ngenerates a recurrent activity between workspace systems.\nOnly when these systems are recurrently activated are they, along with\nthe units that access the information they carry, constituents of the\nworkspace. This activity accounts for the idea of global\nbroadcast in that workspace contents are accessible to\nfurther systems. Broadcasting explains the idea of consciousness as\nfor the subject: globally broadcasted content is accessible\nfor the subject\u2019s use in informing behavior.\n\nThe global neuronal workspace theory provides an account of\naccess consciousness but what of phenomenal consciousness?\nThe theory predicts widespread activation of a cortical workspace\nnetwork as correlated with phenomenal conscious experience, and\nproponents often appeal to imaging results that reveal widespread\nactivation when consciousness is reported (Dehaene & Changeux\n2011). There is, however, a potential confound. We track phenomenal\nconsciousness by access in introspective report, so widespread\nactivity during reports of conscious experience correlates with both\naccess and phenomenal consciousness. Correlation cannot tell us\nwhether the observed activity is the basis of phenomenal consciousness\nor of access consciousness in report (Block 2007). This remains a live\nquestion for as discussed in\n section 2.2,\n we do not have empirical evidence that overflow is false.\n\nTo eliminate the confound, experimenters ensure that performance does\nnot differ between conditions where consciousness is present and where\nit is not. Where this was controlled, widespread activation was not\nclearly observed (Lau & Passingham 2006). Still, the absence of\nobserved activity by an imaging technique does not imply the absence\nof actual activity for the activity might be beyond the limits of\ndetection of that technique. Further, there is a general concern about\nthe significance of null results given that neuroscience studies\nfocused on prefrontal cortex are typically underpowered (for\ndiscussion, see Odegaard, Knight, & Lau 2017).\n",
