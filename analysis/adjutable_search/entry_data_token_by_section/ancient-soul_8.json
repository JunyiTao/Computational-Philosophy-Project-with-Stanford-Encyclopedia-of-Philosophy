    "main_text": "Hellenistic Theories of Soul || The Stoic Theory of Soul\n5.2 The Stoic Theory of Soul\n\n Stoic physics allows for three different kinds of pneuma (lit.\n\u2018breath\u2019), a breath-like material compound of two of the\nfour Stoic elements, fire and air. The kinds of pneuma differ\nboth in degree of tension that results from the expanding and\ncontracting effects, respectively, of its two constituents, and in\ntheir consequent functionality. The lowest kind accounts for the\ncohesion and character of inanimate bodies (e.g., rocks); the\nintermediate kind, called natural pneuma, accounts for the\nvital functions characteristic of plant life; and the third kind is\nsoul, which accounts for the reception and use of impressions (or\nrepresentations) (phantasiai) and impulse (horm\u00ea:\nthat which generates animal movement) or, to use alternative\nterminology, cognition and desire. Our evidence, which unfortunately\nis fragmentary and often unclear, suggests strongly that according to\nthe Stoic theory, the body of an animal (human or non-human) contains\npneuma of all the three kinds, with the lowest kind responsible\nfor the cohesion and character of parts like teeth and bones, natural\npneuma in charge of metabolism, growth and the like, and\nfinally soul accounting for distinctively mental or psychological\nfunctions, crucially cognition, by sense and (in the case of humans)\nintellect, and desire (cf. Long 1999, 564, for discussion and\nreferences). If this is indeed the picture that the theory presents,\nthe soul is no longer responsible for all vital functions, and for all\naspects of life, but only for specifically mental or psychological\nfunctions. (Accordingly, the Stoics depart from the Platonic and\nAristotelian view that plants are ensouled organisms.) At the same\ntime, the Stoic theory does attempt to explain non-mental vital\nfunctions as well, in terms of the activity of \u2018nature\u2019,\nthe intermediate kind of pneuma.  In severing the deeply\nentrenched, Greek ordinary-language connection between soul and life\nin all its forms, the Stoic theory is taking an enormously momentous\nstep, one that obviously restricts rather dramatically the proper\nsubject matter of a theory of soul. In fact it is arguable that the\nStoics, in limiting the functions of soul in the way they did, played\nan important role in a complicated history that resulted in the\nCartesian conception of mind, according to which the mind plainly is\nnot something that animates living bodies. This narrowing of the\nconception of soul is one of two aspects of the Stoic theory that, for\nour purposes, deserve particular notice. \n\n The second noteworthy aspect is the insistence of the Stoic theory\nthat the mind of an adult human being is a single, partless item that\nis rational all the way down. According to the Stoic theory, there are\neight parts of the soul, the \u2018commanding faculty\u2019\n[h\u00eagemonikon] or mind, the five senses, voice and\n(certain aspects of) reproduction. The mind, which is located at the\nheart, is a center that controls the other soul-parts as well as the\nbody, and that receives and processes information supplied by the\nsubordinate parts. The minds of non-human animals and of non-adult\nhumans have faculties only of impression and impulse.  Achieving\nadulthood, for humans, involves gaining assent and reason.  Reason (it\nwould seem) makes assent possible, in that it enables the subject to\nassent to or withhold assent from impressions, and it transforms mere\nimpressions and mere impulses, such as other animals experience, into\nrational impressions and rational impulses. The rationality of an\nimpression (for example, of a tree one sees before oneself) consists\nin its being articulated in terms of concepts, possession of which is\nconstitutive of having reason; the rationality of an impulse consists\nin the fact that it is generated or constituted by a voluntary act of\nassent of the mind to a suitable practical (\u2018impulsive\u2019)\nimpression \u2014 the impression, for instance, that something within\nview would be nice to eat.  Thus, depending on the type of impression\nassented to, assent generates or constitutes belief (or knowledge)\nconcerning some matter of fact, or an impulse to act in some way or\nother.\n\n It is crucially important not to misunderstand these various\nfaculties as parts or aspects of the mind, items that operate with\nsome degree of autonomy from one another and can therefore\nconflict. On the Stoic theory, the faculties of the mind are simply\nthings the mind can do.  Moreover, it is a central part of the theory\nthat, in the case of an adult human being, there is no such thing as\nan impulse without an act of assent of the mind to a corresponding\npractical impression. In a rational subject, the faculty of impulse\ndepends on the faculty of assent, which, like all faculties of such a\nsubject, is a rational faculty. This theory leaves no room for the\nPlatonic conception that the souls of adult human beings contain\nnon-rational parts which can, and frequently do, generate impulse and\nbehavior independently of, and even contrary to, the designs and\npurposes of reason. Nor, relatedly, does it leave room for the shared\nPlatonic and Aristotelian view that desire, even in the case of adult\nhumans, comes in three forms, two of which are such that desires of\nthese forms do not arise from, or depend on, activities of reason.\nThe Stoic theory has the attractive consequence that each adult person\nis, through their own reasoned assent, unambiguously and equally\nresponsible for all their voluntary behavior: there are no Platonic\nnonrational parts, or Platonic-Aristotelian nonrational desires, that\ncould produce actions against one's own reason's helpless\nprotestations. However, the theory needed to be defended both against\nrival philosophical theories and against pre-theoretical intuitions\nthat militate in favor of these theories. One such intuition is that\npassion can, and frequently does, conflict with reason. To judge from\na report by Plutarch, it appears that the Stoics were able to explain\naway this particular intuition, and also to disarm the argument for\ntripartition of the soul in Republic 4, which depends on the\nsimultaneity of a desire for and an aversion to one and the\nsame thing. According to Plutarch (L&S 65G1),\n\n Some people [the Stoics] say that passion is no different from\nreason, and that there is no dissension and conflict between the two,\nbut a turning of the single reason in both directions, which we do not\nnotice owing to the sharpness and speed of the change.\n\n Introducing the idea of unnoticed oscillation of a single, partless\nmind is highly ingenious and must have been dialectically effective at\nleast to some extent. However, the theory of the soul that we find in\nclassical Stoicism appears to be committed to the view that in the\ncase of adult humans, there simply are no motivational factors that do\nnot depend on reason and that can significantly affect, often for the\nworse, how a person behaves and how their life goes. It must have been\ndifficult to defend this view against the Platonic-Aristotelian\nposition. And so it is not surprising that in an environment in which\ninterest in Plato's and Aristotle's writings was on the rise again, at\nleast one prominent Stoic philosopher, Posidonius (first century\nB.C.), apparently gave up at least part of the classical Stoic\ntheory. The evidence that we have is not easy to interpret, but it\nvery much appears that Posidonius introduced into a basically Stoic\npsychological framework the idea that even the minds of adult humans\ninclude, to put things cautiously, motivationally relevant forces (of\ntwo kinds) that do not depend on assent or reason at all and that are\nnot fully subject to rational control.
