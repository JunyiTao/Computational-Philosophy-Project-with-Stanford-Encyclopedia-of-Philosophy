    "main_text": "\n\nPhilippa Foot wrote many articles treating issues in metaethics, moral\npsychology, and applied ethics, as well as one monograph on moral\nphilosophy.  Throughout her career, she defended the objectivity of\nmorality against various forms of noncognitivism and tangled with\nissues of moral motivation, notoriously changing her mind about\nwhether moral judgments necessarily provide rational agents with\nreasons for action. To the wider world, and perhaps especially to\nundergraduate philosophy students, she is best known for inventing the\nTrolley Problem, which raises the question of why it seems permissible\nto steer a trolley aimed at five people toward one person while it\nseems impermissible to do something such as killing one healthy man to\nuse his organs to save five people who will otherwise die. Foot is\nalso known for contributing to the revival of Aristotelian virtue\nethics in contemporary philosophy, though it is less well known that\nshe emphatically disavowed being an adherent of this view as it is\ncurrently understood.\n",
