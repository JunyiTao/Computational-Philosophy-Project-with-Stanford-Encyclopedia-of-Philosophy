Logical Analysis and Logical Construction\n\nIt would be a mistake to see Russell\u2019s logical constructions as\nthe product of the converse operation of a method that begins with\nlogical analysis. Analysis was indeed the distinctive method of\nRussell\u2019s realist and atomistic philosophy with the method of\nconstruction appearing only later. Russell\u2019s new philosophy was\nself-consciously in opposition to the Hegelianism prevailing in\nphilosophy at Cambridge at the end of the nineteenth century (Russell\n1956, 11\u201313). Russell first needed to defend the process of\nanalysis, and to argue against the view of the idealists that complex\nentities are in fact \u201corganic unities\u201d and that any\nanalysis of these unities loses something, as the slogan was\n\u201canalysis is falsification\u201d. (1903, \u00a7439) The subject\nof our analysis is reality, rather than merely our own ideas: \n\n\nAll complexity is conceptual in the sense that it is due to a whole\ncapable of logical analysis, but is real in the sense that it has no\ndependence on the mind, but only upon the nature of the object. Where\nthe mind can distinguish elements, there must be different elements to\ndistinguish; though, alas! there are often different elements which\nthe mind does not distinguish. (1903, \u00a7439)\n\n\nAs ultimate constituents of reality are what is discovered by logical\nanalysis, logical construction cannot be the converse operation, for\nundoing the analysis by putting things back together only returns us\nto the complex entities with which we began. What then is the point of\nconstructing what has already been analyzed? \n\nThe distinction made here between analysis and construction\ndeliberately side-steps an important discussion among scholars of\nFrege and Russell about the nature of analysis. Frege held, in his\nFoundations of Arithmetic (1884, \u00a764), that a\nproposition about identity of numbers could be also analyzed as one\nabout the similarity of classes. He describes this as\n\u201crecarving\u201d one and the same content in different ways.\nLater Frege asserted that the same thought could be viewed as the\nresult of the application of a function to an argument in different\nways. As the logical form of a thought is the result of the\napplication of concepts to arguments, this means that distinct logical\nforms are assigned to the same thought. To resolve the apparent\nconflict with Frege\u2019s famous thesis of \ncompositionality, that a thought is built up from its\nconstituents in a fashion that by and large follows its syntactic\nform, Michael Dummett (1981, chapter 15) distinguishes two notions of\nanalysis in Frege, one as \u201canalysis\u201d proper, the other as\n\u201cdecomposition\u201d. Peter Hylton (2005, 43) argues that there\nis a problematic notion of analysis in Russell, with it being very\ndifficult to say that sentences containing definite descriptions have\nthe complicated quantificational structures assigned to them in\n\u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905) as their \u201creal\nstructure\u201d. Michael Beaney, in his introduction to (2007, 8)\ngives the names \u201cdecompositional\u201d and\n\u201ctransformative\u201d to two kinds of analysis in his\nintroduction to papers that discuss the significance of this\ndistinction for Russell. James Levine claims that in fact the first\nform of analysis, by which the project is to find the ultimate\nconstituents of propositions, belongs to an early project of\n\u201cMoorean Analysis\u201d that Russell abandoned early. Indeed,\nby the time of the account of numbers as classes of equinumerous\nclasses, Russell had already adopted what Levine calls\n\u201cRussell\u2019s Post-Peano Analysis \u201d. \n\nThis debate is certainly relevant to the study of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy, and its connections with Russell\u2019s role as a founder\nof Analytic Philosophy as a movement, but it is perhaps out of keeping\nwith Russell\u2019s own use of the terminology of\n\u201canalysis\u201d. While Peter Strawson, in his \u201cOn\nReferring\u201d (1950) makes numerous allusions to Russell\u2019s\n\u201canalysis\u201d of definite descriptions, in fact the term does\nnot appear in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d. Russell refers to his\n\u201ctheory\u201d of descriptions, and acknowledges that it is not\na proposal that will be recognized immediately as what we have always\nmeant by such sentences, but instead says of his somewhat complicated\nuse of quantifiers and identity symbols that: \n\nThis may seem a somewhat incredible interpretation: but I am not a\npresent giving reasons, I am merely stating the theory. (Russell 1905,\n482)\n\n\nHe then goes on to defend his theory by \u201cdealing\u201d with the\nthree puzzles including the famous example of whether \u201cThe\npresent King of France is bald\u201d is true or false. At no point\ndoes he appeal to what a speaker may have in mind upon uttering one of\nthese sentences. As a result of these facts, it seems that\nRussell\u2019s methodology is best understood by analogy with the\nlogical approach to scientific theories. On this model the result of\n\u201clogical analysis\u201d will be the definitions and primitive\npropositions or axioms from which the laws of a formalized scientific\ntheory can be derived by logical inference. The reduction of one\ntheory to another consists of rewriting the axioms of the target\ntheory using the language of the reducing theory, and then proving\nthem as theorems of that reducing theory. Construction, then, is best\nseen as the process of choosing definitions so that previously\nprimitive statements can be derived as theorems. (See Hager 1994 and\nRussell 1924.)\n\nThis picture fits best with this linguistically oriented notion of\n\u201ctheory construction\u201d rather than the project of\nphilosophical analysis. It also follows the use of the notion of\nconstruction in the tradition of mathematics. Euclid prefaces each\ndemonstration with a \u201cconstruction\u201d of a figure that\nfeatures in the following proof. Gottlob Frege begins every proof in\nhis Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1893) with an\n\u201cAnalysis\u201d, which informally explains the notions used in\nthe theorems and the strategy of the derivation, followed by the\nactual, gapless proof, which is called the \u201cConstruction\u201d.\nHistorically, then, there is no notion of a construction as a\nsynthetic stage following an analytic stage as two processes of a\ncomparable nature, but leading in opposite directions.\n\nEven when described in terms of stages of theory construction,\nanalysis and logical construction are not simply converse operations.\nRussell stresses that the objects discovered and distinguished in\nanalysis are \u201creal\u201d as are their differences from each\nother. Thus there is a constraint on the \u201cchoice\u201d of\ndefinitions and primitive propositions with which to begin. The\nrelationships between a deductive system and a realistic ontology\ndiffer among the various cases that Russell lists as examples of\nlogical constructions. Propositions and \u201ccomplexes\u201d such\nas facts are analyzed in order to find the real objects and relations\nof which they are composed. A logical construction, on the other hand,\nresults in a theory from which truths follow by logical inferences.\nThe truths that are part of a deductive system resulting from logical\nconstruction are only \u201creconstructions\u201d of some of the\n\u201cpre-theoretic\u201d truths that are to be analyzed. It is only\ntheir deductive relations, in particular their deducibility from the\naxioms of the theory, that are relevant to the success of a\nconstruction. Logical constructions do not capture all of the features\nof the pre-theoretic entities with which one begins.\n\nMuch of the attention to logical construction has focused on whether\nit is in fact a unified methodology for philosophy that will introduce\na \u201cscientific method in philosophy\u201d as Russell says in the\nsubtitle of (Russell 1914b). Commentators from Fritz (1952) through\nSainsbury (1979) have denied that Russell\u2019s various\nconstructions fit into a unified methodology, as well as questioning\nthe applicability of the language of \u201cfiction\u201d and\n\u201cincomplete symbol\u201d to all examples. Below it will be\nshown how, nevertheless, constructions do fall into several natural\nfamilies that are described by various of these terms with a\nconsiderable degree of accuracy.\n",
