    "main_text": "\n\nThe \u201cnaturalistic turn\u201d that has swept so many areas of\nphilosophy over the past five decades has also had an impact in\nlegal philosophy. There are various forms of philosophical naturalism,\nall of which have influenced legal philosophy to different extents.\nMethodological naturalists (M-naturalists) view philosophy as\ncontinuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some M-naturalists\nwant to replace conceptual and justificatory theories with\nempirical and descriptive theories; they take their inspiration from\nmore-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual analysis and\nfoundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the\nnormative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy,\nbut emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative\nadvice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some\nM-naturalists are also substantive naturalists\n(S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist\nonly natural or physical things; semantic\nS-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any\nconcept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry.\n\nEach of these varieties of naturalism has applications in legal\nphilosophy. Within legal philosophy, replacement forms of\nM-naturalism hold that: (1) conceptual analysis of the concept of law\nshould be replaced by reliance on the best social scientific\nexplanations of legal phenomena, and (2) normative theories of\nadjudication should be replaced by empirical theories. These views are\nassociated with American Legal Realism and Brian Leiter\u2019s\nreinterpretation of Realism. Normative M-naturalists, by contrast,\ninspired and led by Alvin Goldman, seek to bring empirical results to\nbear on philosophical and foundational questions about adjudication,\nthe legal rules of evidence and discovery, the adversarial process,\nand so forth. Finally, S-naturalism has featured most prominently in\nthe writings of the Scandinavian Legal Realists (long predating the\nresurgence of naturalism in Anglophone jurisprudence), whose\nontological S-naturalism led them to employ a familiar range of\nnaturalism-motivated explanatory strategies, including naturalistic\nreduction of legal concepts and non-cognitivist accounts of important\naspects of legal discourse. S-naturalism also can serve, and sometimes\nhas served, as a motivation for Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\njurisprudential tradition. More recent forms of S-naturalism,\nassociated with a revival of a kind of natural law theory defended by\nDavid Brink and Michael Moore (among others), apply the\n\u201cnew\u201d or \u201ccausal\u201d theory of reference to\nquestions of legal interpretation, including the interpretation of\nmoral concepts as they figure in legal rules.\n",
