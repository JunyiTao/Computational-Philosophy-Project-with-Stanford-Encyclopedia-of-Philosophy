Many thousands of Parisians packed\ninto his public lecture, Existentialism is a Humanism,\ntowards the end of 1945 and the culmination of World War 2. That\nlecture offered an accessible version of his difficult treatise,\nBeing and Nothingness (1943), which had been published two\nyears earlier, and it also responded to contemporary Marxist and\nChristian critics of Sartre\u2019s \u201cexistentialism\u201d.\nSartre was much more than just a traditional academic philosopher,\nhowever, and this begins to explain his renown. He also wrote highly\ninfluential works of literature, inflected by philosophical concerns,\nlike Nausea (1938), The Roads to Freedom trilogy\n(1945\u201349), and plays like No Exit (1947),\nFlies (1947), and Dirty Hands (1948), to name just a\nfew. He founded and co-edited Les Temps Modernes and\nmobilised various forms of political protest and action. In short, he\nwas a celebrity and public intellectual par excellence, especially in\nthe period after Liberation through to the early 1960s. Responding to\nsome calls to prosecute Sartre for civil disobedience, the then French\nPresident Charles de Gaulle replied that you don\u2019t arrest\nVoltaire.\n\nWhile Sartre\u2019s public renown remains, his work has had less\nacademic attention in the last thirty or so years ago, and earlier in\nFrance, dating roughly from the rise of\n\u201cpost-structuralism\u201d in the 1960s. Although Gilles Deleuze\ndedicated an article to his \u201cmaster\u201d in 1964 in the wake\nof Sartre\u2019s attempt to refuse the Nobel Prize for literature\n(Deleuze 2004), Michel Foucault influentially declared Sartre\u2019s\nlate work was a \u201cmagnificent and pathetic attempt of a man of\nthe nineteenth century to think the twentieth century\u201d (Foucault\n1966 [1994: \n 541\u20132])[1].\n In this entry, however, we seek to show what remains alive and of\nongoing philosophical interest in Sartre, covering many of the most\nimportant insights of his most famous philosophical book, Being\nand Nothingness. In addition, significant parts of his oeuvre\nremain under-appreciated and thus we seek to introduce them. Little\nattention has been given to Sartre\u2019s earlier, psychologically\nmotivated philosophical works, such as Imagination (1936) or\nits sequel, The Imaginary (1940). Likewise, few philosophers\nhave seriously grappled with Sartre\u2019s later works, including his\nmassive two-volume Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960), or\nhis various works in existential psychoanalysis that examine the works\nof Genet and Baudelaire, as well as his multi-volume masterpiece on\nFlaubert, The Family Idiot (1971\u20132). These are amongst\nthe works of which Sartre was most proud and we outline some of their\ncore ideas and claims. \n", "toc": [{"#LifeWork": "1. Life and Works"}, {"#TranEgoDiscInte": "2.

Life and Works\n\nSartre\u2019s life has been examined by many biographies, starting\nwith Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s Adieux (and, subsequently,\nCohen-Solal 1985; Levy 2003; Flynn 2014; Cox 2019). Sartre\u2019s\nown literary \u201clife\u201d exemplifies trends he thematized in\nboth Words and Being and Nothingness, summed up by\nhis claim that \u201cto be dead is to be prey for the living\u201d\n(Sartre 1943 [1956: 543]). Sartre himself was one of the first to\nundertake such an autobiographical effort, via his evocation of his\nown childhood in Words (1964a)\u2014in which Sartre applies\nto himself his method of existential psychoanalysis, thereby\ncomplicating this life/death binary.\n\nLike many of his generation, Sartre lived through a series of major\ncultural and historical events that his existential philosophy\nresponded to and attempted to shape. He was born in 1905 and died in\n1980, spanning most of the twentieth century and the trajectory that\nthe Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm refers to as the \u201cage of\nextremes\u201d, a period that was also well-described in the middle\nof that century in Albert Camus\u2019 The Rebel,\nnotwithstanding that the reception of Camus\u2019 book in Les\nTemps Modernes in 1951\u20132 caused Sartre and Camus to very\npublicly fall out.\n\nThe major events of Sartre\u2019s life seem relatively clear, at\nleast viewed from an external perspective. A child throughout World\nWar 1, he was a young man during the Great Depression but born into\nrelative affluence, brought up by his grandmother. At least as\npresented in Words, Sartre\u2019s childhood was filled with\nbooks, the dream of posterity and immortality in those books, and in\nwhich he grappled with his loss of the use of one eye and encountered\nthe realities of his own appearance revealed through his\nmother\u2019s look after a haircut\u2014suffice to say, he was not\nclassically beautiful.\n\nSartre\u2019s education, by contrast, was classical\u2014the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. His education at the ENS was\noriented around the history of philosophy, and the influential\nbifurcation of that time between the neo-Kantianism of Brunschvicg and\nthe vitalism of Bergson. While Sartre failed his first attempt at the\naggregation, apparently by virtue of being overly ambitious, on\nrepeating the year he topped the class (de Beauvoir was second, at her\nfirst attempt and at the age of 21, then the youngest to complete).\nSartre then taught philosophy at various schools, notably at Le Havre\nfrom 1931\u201336 and while he was composing his early philosophy and\nhis great philosophical novel, Nausea. He never entered a\nclassical university position.\n\nAlthough Sartre\u2019s philosophical encounter with phenomenology had\nalready occurred (around 1933), which de Beauvoir described as causing\nhim to turn pale with emotion (de Beauvoir 1960 [1962: 112]), with the\nonset of World War 2 Sartre merged those philosophical concerns with\nmore obviously existential themes like freedom, authenticity,\nresponsibility, and anguish, as translated into English from the\nFrench angoisse by both Hazel Barnes and Sarah Richmond. He\nwas a Meteorologist in Alsace in the war and was captured by the\nGerman Army in 1940 and imprisoned for just under a year (see War\nDiaries). During this socio-political turmoil, Sartre remained\nremarkably prolific.  Notable publications include his play, No\nExit (1947), Being and Nothingness (1943), and then\ncompleting Existentialism is a Humanism\n(1946), Anti-semite and Jew (1946), and founding and\ncoediting Les Temps Modernes, commencing from 1943\n(Sartre\u2019s major contributions are collected in his\nseries Situations, especially volume V).\n\nSartre continued to lead various social and political protests after\nthat period, especially concerning French colonialism (see\n section 7\n below). By the time of the student revolutions in May 1968 he was no\nlonger quite the dominant cultural and intellectual force he had been,\nbut he did not retreat from public life and engagement and died in\n1980. Estimates of the numbers of those attending his funeral\nprocession in Paris range from 50\u2013100,000 people. Sartre had\nbeen in the midst of a collaboration with Benny Levy regarding ethics,\nthe so-called \u201cHope Now\u201d interviews, whose status remain\nsomewhat controversial in Sartrean scholarship, given the interviews\nwere produced in the midst of Sartre\u2019s illness and shortly\nbefore he died, and the fact that the relevant audio-recordings are\nnot publicly available.\n2. Transcendence of the Ego: The Discovery of Intentionality\n\nOne of the most famous foundational moments of existentialism concerns\nSartre\u2019s discovery of phenomenology around the turn of 1932/3,\nwhen in a Parisian bar listening to his friend Raymond Aron\u2019s\ndescription of an apricot cocktail (de Beauvoir 1960 [1962: 135]).\nFrom this moment, Sartre was fascinated by the originality and novelty\nof Husserl\u2019s method, which he identified straight away as a\nmeans to fulfil his own philosophical expectations: overcoming the\nopposition between idealism and realism; getting a view on the world\nthat would allow him \u201cto describe objects just as he saw and\ntouched them, and extract philosophy from the process\u201d. Sartre\nbecame immediately acquainted with Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s early\ntranslation of Husserl\u2019s Cartesian Meditations and his\nintroductory book on Husserl\u2019s theory of intuition. He spent the\nfollowing year in Berlin, so as to study more closely Husserl\u2019s\nmethod and to familiarise himself with the works of his students,\nHeidegger and Scheler. With Levinas, and then later with\nMerleau-Ponty, Ric\u0153ur, and Tran Duc Thao, Sartre became one of\nthe first serious interpreters and proponent of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology in France.\n\nWhile he was studying in Berlin, Sartre tried to convert his study of\nHusserl into an article that documents his enthusiastic discovery of\nintentionality. It was published a few years later under the title\n\u201cIntentionality: a fundamental idea of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology\u201d. This article, which had considerable influence\nover the early French reception of phenomenology, makes explicit the\nreasons Sartre had to be fascinated by Husserl\u2019s descriptive\napproach to consciousness, and how he managed to merge it with his\nprevious philosophical concerns. Purposefully leaving aside the\nidealist aspects of Husserl\u2019s transcendental phenomenology,\nSartre proposes a radicalisation of intentionality that stresses its\nanti-idealistic potential. Against the French contemporary versions of\nneo-Kantianism (Brochard, Lachelier), and more particularly against\nthe kind of idealism advocated by L\u00e9on Brunschvicg, Sartre\nfamously claims that intentionality allows us to discard the\nmetaphysical oppositions between the inner and outer and to renounce\nto the very notion of the interiority of consciousness. If it is true,\nas Husserl states, that every consciousness is consciousness\nof something, and if intentionality accounts for this\nfundamental direction that orients consciousness towards its object\nand beyond itself, then, Sartre concludes, the phenomenological\ndescription of intentionality does away with the illusion that makes\nus responsible for the way the world appears to us. According to\nSartre\u2019s radicalised reading of Husserl\u2019s thesis,\nintentionality is intrinsically realistic: it lets the world appear to\nconsciousness as it really is, and not as a mere correlate of\nan intellectual act. This realistic interpretation, being perfectly in\ntune with Sartre\u2019s lifelong ambition to provide a philosophical\naccount of the contingency of being\u2014its non-negotiable lack of\nnecessity\u2014convinced him to adopt Husserl\u2019s method of\nphenomenological description. \n\nWhile he was still in Berlin, Sartre also began to work on a more\npersonal essay, which a few years later resulted in his first\nsignificant philosophical contribution, Transcendence of the\nEgo. With this influential essay Sartre engages in a much more\ncritical way with the conception of the \u201ctranscendental\nego\u201d presented in Husserl\u2019s Ideas and defends his\nrealistic interpretation of intentionality against the idealistic\ntendencies of Husserl\u2019s own phenomenology after the publication\nof Logical Investigations. Stressing the irreducible\ntransparency of intentional experience\u2014its fundamental\norientation beyond itself towards its object, whatever this object may\nbe\u2014Sartre distinguishes between the dimensions of our subjective\nexperiences that are pre-reflectively lived through, and the\nreflective stance thanks to which one can always make their experience\nthe intentional object towards which consciousness is oriented. One of\nSartre\u2019s most fundamental claims in Transcendence of the\nEgo is that these two forms of consciousness cannot and must not\nbe mistaken with one another: reflexive consciousness is a form of\nintentional consciousness that takes one\u2019s own lived-experiences\nas its specific object, whereas pre-reflexive consciousness need not\ninvolve the intentional distance to the object that the act of\nreflection entails. In regard to self-consciousness, Sartre argues\nthere is an immediate and non-cognitive form of self-awareness, as\nwell as reflective forms of self-consciousness. The latter is unable\nto give access to oneself as the subject of unreflected\nconsciousness, but only as the intentional object of the act\nof reflection, i.e., the Ego in Sartre\u2019s terminology. The Ego is\nthe specific object that intentional consciousness is directed upon\nwhen performing reflection\u2014an object that consciousness\n\u201cposits and grasps [\u2026] in the same act\u201d (Sartre\n1936a [1957: 41; 2004: 5]), and that is constituted in and by the act\nof reflection (Sartre 1936a [1957: 80\u20131; 2004: 20]). Instead of\na transcendental subject, the Ego must consequently be understood as a\ntranscendent object similar to any other object, with the only\ndifference that it is given to us through a particular kind of\nexperience, i.e., reflection. The Ego, Sartre argues, \u201cis\noutside, in the world. It is a being of the world, like the\nEgo of another\u201d (Sartre 1936a [1957: 31; 2004: 1]).\n\nThis critique of the transcendental Ego is less opposed to Husserl\nthan it may seem, notwithstanding Sartre\u2019s reservations about\nthe transcendental radicalisation of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology.\nThe neo-Humean claim that the \u201cI\u201d or Ego is nowhere to be\nfound \u201cwithin\u201d ourselves remains faithful to the 5th\nLogical Investigation, in which Husserl had initially\nfollowed the very same line of reasoning (see Husserl 1901 [2001: vol.\n2, 91\u201393]), before developing a transcendental methodology that\nsubstantially modified his approach to subjectivity (as exposed in\nparticular in Husserl 1913 [1983]). However, for the Husserl of the\nIdeas Pertaining to a Phenomenology (published in 1913), the\nsense in which a perceptual object, which is necessarily seen from one\nside but also presented to us as a unified object (involving other\nunseen sides), requires that there be a unifying structure within\nconsciousness itself: the transcendental ego. Sartre argues that such\nan account would entail that the perception of an object would always\nalso involve an intermediary perception\u2014such as some kind of\nperception or consciousness of the transcendental ego\u2014thus\nthreatening to disrupt the \u201ctransparency\u201d or\n\u201ctranslucidity\u201d of consciousness. All forms of perception\nand consciousness would involve (at least) these two components, and\nthere would be an opaqueness to consciousness that is not\nphenomenologically apparent. In addition, it appears that\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental ego would have to pre-exist all of our\nparticular actions and perceptions, which is something that the\nexistentialist dictum \u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d, which\nwe will explicate shortly, seems committed to denying. Without\nconsidering here the extent to which Husserl can be defended against\nthese charges, Sartre\u2019s general claim is that the notion of a\nself or ego is not given in experience. Rather, it is something that\nis not immanent but transcendent to pre-reflective experience. The Ego\nis the transcendent object of one\u2019s reflexive\nexperience, and not the subject of the pre-reflective experience that\nwas initially lived (but not known).\n\nSartre devotes a great deal of effort to establishing the impersonal\n(or \u201cpre-personal\u201d) character of consciousness, which\nstems from its non-egological structure and results directly from the\nabsence of the I in the transcendental field. According to\nhim, intentional (positional) consciousness typically involves an\nanonymous and \u201cimpersonal\u201d relation to a transcendent\nobject: \n\n\nWhen I run after a streetcar, when I look at the time, when I am\nabsorbed in contemplating a portrait, there is no I.\n[\u2026] In fact I am plunged in the world of objects; it is they\nwhich constitute the unity of my consciousness; [\u2026] but\nme, I have disappeared; I have annihilated myself. There is\nno place for me on this level. (Sartre 1936a [1957: 49; 2004:\n8]) \n\n\nThe tram appears to me in a specific way (as\n\u201chaving-to-be-overtaken\u201d, in this case) that is\nexperienced as its own mode of phenomenalization, and not as\na mere relational aspect of its appearing to me. The object\npresents itself as carrying a set of objective properties that are\nstrictly independent from one\u2019s personal relation to it. The\nstreetcar is experienced as a transcendent object, in a way that\nobliterates and overrides, so to speak, the subjective\nfeatures of conscious experience; its\n\u201chaving-to-be-overtaken-ness\u201d does not belong to my\nsubjective experience of the world but to the\nobjective description of the way the world is (see also\nSartre 1936a [1957: 56; 2004: 10\u201311]). When I run after the\nstreetcar, my consciousness is absorbed in the relation to its\nintentional object, \u201cthe\nstreetcar-having-to-be-overtaken\u201d, and there is no trace of\nthe \u201cI\u201d in such lived-experience. I do not need to be\naware of my intention to take the streetcar, since the object itself\nappears as having-to-be-overtaken, and the subjective properties of my\nexperience disappear in the intentional relation to the object. They\nare lived-through without any reference to the experiencing subject\n(or to the fact that this experience has to be experienced by\nsomeone). This particular feature derives from the diaphanousness\nof lived-experiences. In a different example of this, Sartre argues\nthat when I perceive Pierre as loathsome, say, I do not perceive my\nfeeling of hatred; rather, Pierre repulses me and I experience\nhim as repulsive (Sartre 1936a [1957: 63\u20134; 2004: 13]).\nRepulsiveness constitutes an essential feature of his\ndistinctive mode of appearing, rather than a trait of my\nfeelings towards him. Sartre concludes that reflective statements\nabout one\u2019s Ego cannot be logically derived from non-reflective\n(\u201cirr\u00e9fl\u00e9chies\u201d) lived-experiences:\n\n\n\nThus to say \u201cI hate\u201d or \u201cI love\u201d on the\noccasion of a singular consciousness of attraction or repulsion, is to\ncarry out a veritable passage to the infinite [\u2026] Nothing more\nis needed for the rights of reflection to be singularly limited: it is\ncertain that Pierre repulses me, yet it is and will remain forever\ndoubtful that I hate him. Indeed, this affirmation infinitely exceeds\nthe power of reflection. (Sartre 1936a [1957: 63\u20134; 2004: 13])\n\n\n\nThis critique of the powers of reflection forms one important part of\nSartre\u2019s argument for the primacy of pre-reflective\nconsciousness over reflective consciousness, which is central to many\nof the pivotal arguments of Being and Nothingness, as we\nindicate in the relevant sections below.\n3. Imagination, Phenomenology and Literature\n\nFor many of his readers, the book on the Imaginary that\nSartre published in 1940 constitutes one of the most rigorous and\nfruitful developments of his Husserl-inspired phenomenological\ninvestigations. Along with the The Emotions: Outline of a\nTheory which was published one year before (Sartre 1939b), Sartre\npresented this study of imagination as an essay in phenomenological\npsychology, which drew on his lifetime interest in psychological\nstudies and brought to completion the research on imagination he had\nundertaken since the very beginning of his philosophical career. With\nthis new essay, Sartre continues to explore the relationship between\nintentional consciousness and reality by focusing upon the specific\ncase of the intentional relations to the unreal and the fictional, so\nas to produce an in-depth analysis of \u201cthe great\n\u2018irrealizing\u2019 function of consciousness\u201d. Engaging\nin a detailed discussion with recent psychological research that\nSartre juxtaposes with (and against) fine-grained phenomenological\ndescriptions of the structures of imagination, his essay proposes his\nown theory of the imaginary as the corollary of a specific intentional\nattitude that orients consciousness towards the unreal.\n\nIn a similar fashion to his analysis of the world-shaping powers of\nemotions (Sartre 1939b), Sartre describes and highlights how\nimagination presents us with a coherent world, although made of\nobjects that do not precede but result from the imaging\ncapacities of consciousness. \u201cThe object as imaged, Sartre\nclaims, is never anything more than the consciousness one has of\nit\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 15]). Contrary to other modes of\nconsciousness such as perception or memory, which connect us to a\nworld that is essentially one and the same, the objects to which\nimaginative consciousness connects us belong to imaginary worlds,\nwhich may not only be extremely diverse, but also follow their own\nrules, having their own spatiality and temporality. The island of\nThrinacia where Odysseus lands on his way back to Ithaca needs not be\nlocated anywhere on our maps nor have existed at a specific time: its\nmode of existence is that of a fictional object, which possesses its\nown spatiality and temporality within the imaginary world it belongs\nto.\n\nSartre stresses that the intentional dimension of imaging\nconsciousness is essentially characterised by its negativity.\nThe negative act, Sartre writes, is \u201cconstitutive of the\nimage\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 183]): an image consciousness is a\nconsciousness of something that is not, whether its object is\nabsent, non-existing, or fictional. When we picture Odysseus sailing\nback to his native island, Odysseus is given to us \u201cas absent to\nintuition\u201d. In this sense, Sartre concludes, \n\n\none can say that the image has wrapped within it a certain\nnothingness. [\u2026] However lively, appealing, strong the image,\nit gives its object as not being. (Sartre 1940 [2004: 14]) \n\n\nThe irrealizing function of imagination results from this immediate\nconsciousness of the nothingness of its object. Sartre\u2019s essay\ninvestigates how imaging consciousness allows us to operate with its\nobjects as if they were present, even though these very objects are\ngiven to us as non-existing or absent. This is for instance what\nhappens when we go to the theatre or read a novel: \n\n\nTo be present at a play is to apprehend the characters on the actors,\nthe forest of As You Like It on the cardboard trees. To read\nis to realize contact with the irreal world on the signs. In this\nworld there are plants, animals, fields, towns, people: initially\nthose mentioned in the book and then a host of others that are not\nnamed but are in the background and give this world its depth. (Sartre\n1940 [2004: 64]) \n\n\nThe irreality of imaginary worlds does not prevent the spectator or\nreader from projecting herself into this world as if it was\nreal. The acts of imagination can consequently be described as\n\u201cmagical acts\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 125]), similar to\nincantations with respect to the way they operate, since they are\ndesigned to make the object of one\u2019s thought or desire appear in\nsuch a way that one can take possession of it.\n\nIn the conclusion of his essay, Sartre stresses the philosophical\nsignificance of the relationship between imagination and freedom,\nwhich are both necessarily involved in our relationship to the world.\nImagination, Sartre writes, \u201cis the whole of consciousness as it\nrealizes its freedom\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 186]). Imaging\nconsciousness posits its object as \u201cout of reach\u201d in\nrelation to the world understood as the synthetic totality within\nwhich consciousness situates itself. For Sartre, the imaginary\ncreation is only possible if consciousness is not placed\n\u201cin-the-midst-of-the-world\u201d as one existent among others.\n\n\n\nFor consciousness to be able to imagine, it must be able to escape\nfrom the world by its very nature, it must be able to stand back from\nthe world by its own efforts. In a word, it must be free. (Sartre 1940\n[2004: 184]) \n\n\nIn that respect, the irrealizing function of imagination allows\nconsciousness to \u201csurpass the real\u201d so as to constitute it\nas a proper world: \u201cthe nihilation of the real is\nalways implied by its constitution as a world\u201d. This capacity of\nsurpassing the real to make it a proper world defines the very notion\nof \u201csituation\u201d that becomes central in Sartre\u2019s\nphilosophical thought after the publication of the Imaginary.\nSituations are nothing but \u201cthe different immediate modes of\napprehension of the real as a world\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 185]).\nConsciousness\u2019 situation-in-the-world is precisely that which\nmotivates the constitution of any irreal object and accounts for the\ncreation of imaginary worlds\u2014for instance, and perhaps above\nall, in art: \n\n\nEvery apprehension of the real as a world tends of its own accord to\nend up with the production of irreal objects since it is always, in a\nsense, free nihilation of the world and this always from a particular\npoint of view. (Sartre 1940 [2004: 185]) \n\n\nWith this conclusion, which prioritises the question of the world over\nthat of reality, Sartre begins to move away from the realist\nperspective he was initially aiming at when he first discovered\nphenomenology, so as to make the phenomenological investigation of our\n\u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d (influenced by his careful rereading\nof Heidegger in the late 30s) his new priority. \n\nAlthough Sartre never stated it explicitly, his interest in the\nquestion of the unreal and imaging consciousness appears to be\nintimately connected with his general conception of literature and his\nself-understanding of his own literary production. The concluding\nremarks of the Imaginary extend the scope of Sartre\u2019s\nphenomenological analyses of the irrealizing powers of imagination, by\napplying them to the domain of aesthetics so as to answer the question\nabout the ontological status of works of art. For Sartre, any product\nof artistic creation\u2014a novel, a painting, a piece of music, or a\ntheatre play\u2014is just as irreal an object as the imaginary world\nit gives rise to. The irreality of the work of art allows us to\nexperience\u2014though only imaginatively\u2014the world it gives\nflesh to as an \u201canalogon\u201d of reality. Even a cubist\npainting, which might not depict nor represent anything, still\nfunctions as an analogon, which manifests \n\n\nan irreal ensemble of new things, of objects that I have\nnever seen nor will ever see but that are nonetheless irreal objects.\n(Sartre 1940 [2004: 191]) \n\n\nLikewise, the novelist, the poet, the dramatist, constitute irreal\nobjects through verbal analogons.\n\nThis original conception of the nature of the work of art dominates\nSartre\u2019s critical approach to literature in the many essays he\ndedicates to the art of the novel. This includes his critical analyses\nof recent writers\u2019 novels in the 30s\u2014Faulkner, Dos Passos,\nHemingway, Mauriac, etc.\u2014and the publication in the late 40s of\nhis own summative view, What is literature? (Sartre 1948a\n[1988]). In a series of articles gathered in the first volume of his\nSituations (1947, Sit. I), Sartre defends a strong\nversion of literary realism that can, somewhat paradoxically, be read\nas a consequence of his theory of the irreality of the work of art. If\nimagination projects the spectator within the imaginary world created\nby the artist, then the success of the artistic process is\nproportional to the capacity of the artwork to let the spectator\nexperience it as a reality of its own, giving rise to a full-fledged\nworld. Sartre applies in particular this analysis to novels, which\nmust aim, according to him, at immersing the reader within the\nfictional world they depict so as to make her experience the events\nand adventures of the characters as if she was living them in\nfirst person. The complete absorption of the reader within the\nimaginary world created by the novelist must ultimately recreate the\nparticular feel of reality that defines Sartre\u2019s\nphenomenological kind of literary realism (Renaudie 2017),\nwhich became highly influential over the following decades in French\nliterature. The reader must be able to experience the actions of the\ncharacters of the novel as if they did not result from the imagination\nof the novelist, but proceeded from the character\u2019s own\nfreedom\u2014and Sartre goes as far as to claim that this radical\n\u201cspellbinding\u201d (\u201cenvo\u00fbtante\u201d, Sartre\n1940 [2004: 175])) quality of literary fiction defines the touchstone\nof the art of the novel (See \u201cFran\u00e7ois Mauriac and\nFreedom\u201d, in Sartre Sit. I).\n\nThis original version of literary realism is intrinsically tied to the\nquestion of freedom, and opposed to the idea according to which\nrealist literature is expected to provide a mere description of\nreality as it is. In What is Literature?, Sartre\ndescribes the task of the novelist as that of disclosing the world as\nif it arose from human freedom\u2014rather than from a deterministic\nchain of causes and consequences. The author\u2019s art consists in\nobliging her reader \u201cto create what [she]\ndiscloses\u201d, and so to share with the writer the\nresponsibility and freedom involved in the act of literary creation\n(Sartre 1948a [1988: 61]). In order for the world of the novel to\noffer its maximum density, \n\n\nthe disclosure-creation by which the reader discovers it must also be\nan imaginary engagement in the action; in other words, the more\ndisposed one is to change it, the more alive it will be. \n\n\nThe conception of the writer\u2019s engagement that resulted from\nthese analyses constitutes probably the most well-known aspect of\nSartre\u2019s relation to literature. The writer only has one topic:\nfreedom.\n\nThis analysis of the role of imaginative creations of art can also\nhelp us to understand the role of philosophy within his own novels,\nparticularly in Nausea, a novel which Sartre began as he was\nstudying Husserl in Berlin. In this novel Sartre\u2019s\npre-phenomenological interest for the irreducibility of contingency\nintersects with his newly-acquired competences in phenomenological\nanalyses, making Nausea a beautifully illustrated expression\nof the metaphysical register Sartre gave to Husserl\u2019s conception\nof intentionality. The feeling of nausea that Roquentin, the main\ncharacter of Sartre\u2019s novel, famously experienced in a public\ngarden while obsessively watching a chestnut tree, accounts for his\nsensitivity to the absolute lack of necessity of whatever exists.\nSartre understands this radical absence of necessity as the expression\nof the fundamental contingency of being. Roquentin\u2019s traumatic\nmoment of realisation that there is absolutely no reason for the\nexistence of all that exists illustrates the intuition that motivated\nSartre\u2019s philosophical thinking since the very beginning of his\nintellectual career as a student at the Ecole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure, as Simone de Beauvoir recalls (1981 [1986]). It\nconstitutes the metaphysical background of his interpretation of\nintentionality, which he would come to develop and systematise in the\nearly dense parts of Being and Nothingness. While the\nexperience of nausea when confronting the contingency of the chestnut\ntree does not give us conceptual knowledge, it involves a form of\nnon-conceptual ontological awareness that is of a fundamentally\ndifferent order to, and cannot be derived from, our conceptual\nunderstanding and knowledge of brute existence.\n4. Being and Nothingness\n4.1. Negation and freedom\n\nBeing and Nothingness (1943) remains the defining treatise of\nthe existentialist \u201cmovement\u201d, along with works from de\nBeauvoir from this period (e.g., The Ethics of Ambiguity). We\ncannot do justice to the entirety of the book here, but we can\nindicate the broad outlines of the position. In brief, Sartre provides\na series of arguments for the necessary freedom of \u201chuman\nreality\u201d (his gloss on Heidegger\u2019s conception of Dasein),\nbased upon an ontological distinction between what he calls\nbeing-for-itself (pour soi) and being-in-itself (en\nsoi), roughly between that which negates and transcends\n(consciousness) and the \"pure plenitude\" of objects. That kind of\nmetaphysical position might seem to \u201cbeg the question\u201d by\nassuming what it purports to establish (i.e., radical human freedom).\nHowever, Sartre argues that realism and idealism cannot sufficiently\naccount for a wide range of phenomena associated with negation. He\nalso draws on the direct evidence of phenomenological experience\n(i.e., the experience of anguish). But the argument for his\nmetaphysical picture and human freedom is, on balance, an inference to\nthe best explanation. He contends that his complex metaphysical vision\nbest captures and explains central aspects of human reality.\n\nAs the title of the book suggests, nothingness plays a significant\nrole. While Sartre\u2019s concern with nothingness might be a\ndeal-breaker for some, following Rudolph Carnap\u2019s trenchant\ncriticisms of Heidegger\u2019s idea that the \u201cnothing\nnoths/nothings\u201d (depending on translation from the German),\nSartre\u2019s account of negation and nothingness (the latter of\nwhich is the ostensible ground of the former) is nevertheless\nphilosophically interesting. Sartre does not say much about the\ngenesis of consciousness or the for-itself, other than that it is\ncontingent and arises from \u201cthe effort of an in-itself to found\nitself\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 84]). He describes the appearance of\nthe for-itself as the absolute event, which occurs through\nbeing\u2019s attempt \u201cto remove contingency from its\nbeing\u201d. Accordingly, the for-itself is radically and inescapably\ndistinct from the in-itself. In particular, it functions primarily\nthrough negation, whether in relation to objects, values, meaning, or\nsocial facts. According to Sartre this negation is not about any\nreflective judgement or cognition, but an ontological relation to the\nworld. This ontological interpretation of negation minimises the\nsubjectivist interpretations of his philosophy. The most vivid example\nhe provides to illustrate this pre-reflective negation is the\napprehension of Pierre\u2019s absence from a caf\u00e9. Sartre\ndescribes Pierre\u2019s absence as pervading the whole caf\u00e9.\nThe caf\u00e9 is cast in the metaphorical \u201cshade\u201d of\nPierre not being there at the time he had been expected. This\nexperience depends on human expectations, of course. But Sartre argues\nthat if, by contrast, we imagine or reflect that someone else is not\npresent (say the Duke of Wellington, an elephant, etc.), these\nabstract negative facts are not existentially given in the same manner\nas our pre-reflective encounter with Pierre\u2019s absence. They are\nnot given as an \u201cobjective fact\u201d, as a \u201ccomponent of\nthe real\u201d.\n\nSartre provides numerous other examples of pre-reflective negation\nthroughout Being and Nothingness. He argues that the\napprehension of fragility and destruction are likewise premised on\nnegativity, and any effort to adequately describe these phenomena\nrequires negative concepts, but also that they presuppose more than\njust negative thoughts and judgements. In regard to destruction,\nSartre suggests that there is not less after the storm, just\nsomething else (Sartre 1943 [1956: 8]). Generally, we do not need to\nreflectively judge that a building has been destroyed, but directly\nsee it in terms of that which it is not\u2014the building,\nsay, in its former glory before being wrecked by the storm. Humans\nintroduce the possibility of destruction and fragility into the world,\nsince objectively there is just a change. Sartre\u2019s basic\nquestion is: how could we accomplish this unless we are a being by\nwhom nothingness comes into the world, i.e., free? He poses similar\narguments in regard to a range of phenomena that present as basic to\nour modes of inhabiting the world, from bad faith through to anguish.\nIn all of these cases Sartre argues that while we can expressly pose\nnegative judgements, or deliberately ask questions that admit of the\npossibility of negative reply, or consciously individuate and\ndistinguish objects by reference to the objects which they are not,\nthere is a pre-comprehension of non-being that is the condition of\nsuch negative judgements.\n\nAlthough the for-itself and the in-itself are initially defined very\nabstractly, the book ultimately comes to say a lot more about the\nfor-itself, even if not much more about the in-itself. The picture of\nthe for-itself and its freedom gradually becomes more\n\u201cconcrete\u201d, reflecting the architectonic of the text,\nwhich has more sustained treatments of the body, others, and action,\nin the second half. Throughout, Sartre gives a series of paradoxical\nglosses on the nature of the for-itself\u2014i.e., a \u201cbeing\nwhich is what it is not and is not what it is\u201d (Sartre 1943\n[1956: 79]). Although this might appear to be a contradiction,\nSartre\u2019s claim is that it is the fundamental mode of existence\nof the for-itself that is future-oriented and does not have a stable\nidentity in the manner of a chair, say, or a pen-knife. Rather,\n\u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d, as he famously remarks in\nboth Being and Nothingness and Existentialism is a\nHumanism. \n\nIn later chapters he develops the basic ontological position in regard\nto free action. His point is not, of course, to say we are free to do\nor achieve anything (freedom as power), or even to claim that we are\nfree to \u201cproject\u201d anything at all. The for-itself is\nalways in a factical situation. Nonetheless, he asserts that the\ncombination of the motives and ends we aspire to in relation to that\nfacticity depend on an act of negation in relation to the given. As he\nputs it: \u201cAction necessarily implies as its condition the\nrecognition of a \u201cdesideratum\u201d; that is, of an objective\nlack or again of a negatit\u00e9\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 433]).\nEven suffering in-itself is not a sufficient motive to determine\nparticular acts. Rather, it is the apprehension of the revolution as\npossible (and as desired) which gives to the worker\u2019s suffering\nits value as motive (Sartre 1943 [1956: 437]). A factual state, even\npoverty, does not determine consciousness to apprehend it as a lack.\nNo factual state, whatever it may be, can cause consciousness to\nrespond to it in any one way. Rather, we make a choice (usually\npre-reflective) about the significance of that factual state for us,\nand the ends and motives that we adopt in relation to it. We are\n\u201ccondemned\u201d to freedom of this ontological sort, with\nresulting anguish and responsibility for our individual situation, as\nwell as for more collective situations of racism, oppression, and\ncolonialism. These are the themes for which Sartre became famous,\nespecially after World War 2 and Existentialism is a\nHumanism.\n\nIn Being and Nothingness he provides various examples that\nare designed to make this quite radical philosophy of freedom\nplausible, including the hiker who gives in to their fatigue and\ncollapses to the ground. Sartre says that a necessary condition for\nthe hiker to give in to their fatigue\u2014short of fainting\u2014is\nthat their fatigue goes from being experienced as simply part of the\nbackground to their activity, with their direct conscious attention\nfocusing on something else (e.g., the scenery, the challenge,\ncompeting with a friend, philosophising, etc.), to being the direct\nfocus of their attention and thus becoming a motive for direct\nrecognition of one\u2019s exhaustion and the potential action of\ncollapsing to the ground. Although we are not necessarily reflectively\naware of having made such a decision, things could have been otherwise\nand thus Sartre contends we have made a choice. Despite appearances,\nhowever, Sartre insists that his view is not a voluntarist or\ncapricious account of freedom, but one that necessarily involves a\nsituation and a context. His account of situated freedom in the\nchapter \u201cFreedom and Action\u201d affirms the inability to\nextricate intentions, ends, motives, and reasons, from the embodied\ncontext of the actor. As a synthetic whole, it is not merely freedom\nof intention or motive (and hence even consciousness) that Sartre\naffirms. Rather, our freedom is realised only in its projections and\nactions, and is nothing without such action.\n4.2 Bad faith and the critique of Freudian psychoanalysis\n\nSartre\u2019s account of bad faith (mauvaise foi) is of\nmajor interest. It is said to be a phenomenon distinctive of the\nfor-itself, thus warranting ontological treatment. It also feeds into\nquestions to do with self-knowledge (see Moran 2001), as well as\nserving as the basis for some of his criticisms of racism and\ncolonialism in his later work. His account of bad faith juxtaposes a\ncritique of Freud with its own \u201cdepth\u201d interpretive\naccount, \u201cexistential psychoanalysis\u201d, which is itself\nindebted to Freud, as Sartre admits. \n\nWe will start with Sartre\u2019s critique of Freud, which is both\nsimple and complex, and features in the early parts of the chapter on\nbad faith in Being and Nothingness. In short, Freud\u2019s\ndiffering meta-psychological pictures (Conscious, Preconscious,\nUnconscious, or Id, Ego, Superego) are charged with splitting the\nsubject in two (or more) in attempting to provide a mechanistic\nexplanation of bad faith: that is, how there can be a\n\u201cliar\u201d and a \u201clied to\u201d duality within a single\nconsciousness. But Sartre accuses Freud of reifying this structure,\nand rather than adequately explaining the problem of bad faith, he\nargues that Freud simply transfers the problem to another level where\nit remains unsolved, thus consisting in a pseudo-explanation (which\ntoday might be called a \u201chomuncular fallacy\u201d). Rather than\nthe problem being something that pertains to an embodied subject, and\nhow they might both be aware of something and yet also repress it at\nthe same time, Sartre argues that the early Freudian\nmeta-psychological model transfers the seat of this paradox to the\ncensor: that is, to a functional part of the brain/mind that both\nknows and does not know. It must know enough in order to efficiently\nrepress, but it also must not know too much or nothing is hidden and\nthe problematic truth is manifest directly to consciousness.\nFreud\u2019s \u201cexplanation\u201d is hence accused of\nrecapitulating the problem of bad faith in an ostensible mechanism\nthat is itself \u201cconscious\u201d in some paradoxical sense.\nSartre even provocatively suggests that the practice of psychoanalysis\nis itself in bad faith, since it treats a part of ourselves as\n\u201cId\u201d-like and thereby denies responsibility for it. That\nis not the end of Sartre\u2019s story, however, because he ultimately\nwants to revive a version of psychoanalysis that does not pivot around\nthe \u201cunconscious\u201d and these compartmentalised models of\nthe mind. We will come back to that, but it is first necessary to\nintroduce Sartre\u2019s own positive account of bad faith.\n\nWhile bad faith is inevitable in Sartre\u2019s view, it is also\nimportant to recognise that the \u201cgerm of its destruction\u201d\nlies within. This is because bad faith always remains at least partly\navailable to us in our own lived-experience, albeit not in a manner\nthat might be given propositional form in the same way as knowledge of\nan external object. In short, when I existentially comprehend that my\nlife is dissatisfying, or even reflect on this basis that I have lived\nan inauthentic life, while I am grasping something about myself (it is\ngiven differently to the recognition that others have lived a lie and\nmore likely to induce anxiety), I am nonetheless not strictly\nequivalent or identical with the \u201cI\u201d that is claimed to be\nin bad faith (cf. Moran 2001). There is a distanciation involved in\ncoming to this recognition and the potential for self-transformation\nof a more practical kind, even if this is under-thematised in\nBeing and Nothingness.\n\nSartre gives many examples of bad faith that remain of interest. His\nmost famous example of bad faith is the caf\u00e9 waiter who plays\nat being a caf\u00e9 waiter, and who attempts to institutionalise\nthemselves as this object. While Sartre\u2019s implied criticisms of\ntheir manner of inhabiting the world might seem to disparage social\nroles and affirm an individualism, arguably this is not a fair reading\nof the details of the text. For Sartre we do have a factical\nsituation, but the claim is that we cannot be wholly reduced to it. As\nSartre puts it: \n\n\nThere is no doubt I am in a sense a caf\u00e9 waiter\u2014otherwise\ncould I not just as well call myself a diplomat or reporter? But if I\nam one, this cannot be in the mode of being-in-itself. I am a waiter\nin the mode of being what I am not. (Sartre 1943 [1956: 60])\n\n\n\nIn subsequent work, racism becomes emblematic of bad faith, when we\nreduce the other to some ostensible identity (e.g., Anti-semite\nand the Jew).\n\nIt is important to recognise that no project of\n\u201csincerity\u201d, if that is understood as strictly being what\none is, is possible for Sartre given his view of the for-itself.\nLikewise, in regard to any substantive self-knowledge that might be\nachieved through direct self-consciousness, our options are limited.\nOn Sartre\u2019s view we cannot look inwards and discover the truth\nabout our identity or our own bad faith through simple introspection\n(there is literally no-thing to observe). Moreover, when we have a\nlived experience, and then reflect on ourselves from outside (e.g.,\nthird-personally), we are not strictly reducible to that Ego that is\nso posited. We transcend it. Or, to be more precise, we both are that\nEgo (just as we are what the Other perceives) and yet are also not\nreducible to it. This is due to the structure of consciousness and the\narguments from Transcendence of the Ego examined in\n section 2.\n In Being and Nothingness, the temporal aspects of this\nnon-coincidence are also emphasised. We are not just our past and our\nobjective attributes in accord with some sort of principle of\nidentity, because we are also our \u201cprojects\u201d, and these\nare intrinsically future oriented.\n\nNonetheless, Sartre argues that it would be false to conclude that all\nmodes of inhabiting the world are thereby equivalent in terms of\n\u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d. Rather, there are\nwhat he calls \u201cpatterns of bad faith\u201d and he says these\nare \u201cobjective\u201d. Any conduct can be seen from two\nperspectives\u2014transcendence and facticity, being-for-itself and\nbeing-for-others. But it is the exclusive affirmation of one or the\nothers of these (or a motivated and selective oscillation between\nthem) which constitutes bad faith. There is no direct account of good\nfaith in Being and Nothingness, other than the enigmatic\nfootnote at the end of the book that promises an ethics. There are\nmore sustained treatments of authenticity in his Notebooks for an\nEthics and in Anti-semite and Jew (see also the entry on\n authenticity).\n4.3 The Look, shame and intersubjectivity\n\nSartre\u2019s work on inter-subjectivity is often the subject of\npremature dismissal. The hyperbolic dimension of his writings on the\nLook of the Other and the pessimism of his chapter on \u201cconcrete\nrelations with others\u201d, which is essentially a restatement of\nthe \u201cmaster-slave\u201d stage of Hegel\u2019s struggle for\nrecognition without the possibility of its overcoming, are sometimes\ntreated as if they were nothing but the product of a certain sort of\nmind\u2014a kind of adolescent paranoia or hysteria about the Other\n(see, e.g., Marcuse 1948). What this has meant, however, is that the\nsignificance of Sartre\u2019s work on inter-subjectivity, both within\nphenomenological circles and more broadly in regard to philosophy of\nmind and social cognition, has been downplayed. Building on the\ninsights of Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger, Sartre proposes a set of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for any theory of the other, which\nare far from trivial. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre\nsuggests that various philosophical positions\u2014realism and\nidealism, and beyond\u2014have been shipwrecked, often unawares, on\nwhat he calls the \u201creef of solipsism\u201d. His own solution to\nthe problem of other minds consists, first and foremost, in his\ndescriptions of being subject to the look of another, and the way in\nwhich in such an experience we become a \u201ctranscendence\ntranscended\u201d. On his famous description, we are asked to imagine\nthat we are peeping through a keyhole, pre-reflectively immersed and\nabsorbed in the scene on the other side of the door. Maybe we would be\nnervous engaging in such activities given the socio-cultural\nassociations of being a \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d, but after a period\nof time we would be given over to the scene with self-reflection and\nself-awareness limited to merely the minimal (tacit or\n\u201cnon-thetic\u201d in Sartre\u2019s language) understanding\nthat we are not what we are perceiving. Suddenly, though, we hear\nfootsteps, and we have an involuntary apprehension of ourselves as an\nobject in the eyes of another; a \u201cpre-moral\u201d experience of\nshame; a shudder of recognition that we are the object that the other\nsees, without room for any sort of inferential theorising or cognising\n(at least that is manifest to our own consciousness). This ontological\nshift, Sartre says, has another person as its condition,\nnotwithstanding whether or not one is in error on a particular\noccasion of such an experience (i.e., the floor creaks but there is\nno-one actually literally present). While many other phenomenological\naccounts emphasise empathy or direct perception of mental states (for\nexample, Scheler and Merleau-Ponty), Sartre thereby adds something\nsignificant and distinctive to these accounts that focus on our\nexperience of the other person as an object (albeit of a special kind)\nrather than as a subject. In common with other phenomenologists like\nMerleau-Ponty and Scheler, Sartre also maintains that it is a mistake\nto view our relations with the other as one characterised by a radical\nseparation that we can only bridge with inferential reasoning. Any\nargument by analogy, either to establish the existence of others in\ngeneral or to particular mental states like anger, is problematic,\nbegging the question and having insufficient warrant.\n\nFor Sartre, at least in his early work, our experience of being what\nhe calls a \u201cwe subject\u201d\u2014as a co-spectator in a\nlecture or concert for example, which involves no objectification of\nthe other people we are with\u2014is said to be merely a subjective\nand psychological phenomenon that does not ground our understanding\nand knowledge of others ontologically (Sartre 1943 [1956:\n413\u20135]). Originally, human relations are typified by dyadic mode\nof conflict best captured in the look of the other, and the sort of\nscenario concerning the key-hole we just considered above. Given that\nwe also do not grasp a plural look, for Sartre, this means that social\nlife is fundamentally an attempt to control the impact of the look\nupon us, either by anticipating it in advance and attempting to\ninvalidate that perspective (sadism) or by anticipating it and\nattempting to embrace that solicited perspective when it comes\n(masochism). In Sartre\u2019s words: \n\n\nIt is useless for human reality to seek to escape this dilemma: one\nmust either transcend the Other or allow oneself to be transcended by\nhim. The essence of the relations between consciousness is not the\nMitsein (being-with); it is conflict. (Sartre 1943 [1956:\n429])\n\n5. Existential Psychoanalysis and the Fundamental Project\n\nSartre\u2019s radical criticism of Freud\u2019s theory of the\nunconscious is not his last word on psychoanalysis. In the last\nchapters of Being and Nothingness, Sartre presents his own\nconception of an existential psychoanalysis, drawing on some insights\nfrom his attempt to account for Emperor Wilhelm II as a\n\u201chuman-reality\u201d in the 14th notebook from his\nWar Diaries (Sartre 1983b [1984]). This existential version\nof psychoanalysis is claimed to be compatible with Sartre\u2019s\nrejection of the unconscious, and is expected to achieve a\n\u201cpsychoanalysis of consciousness\u201d (Moati 2020: 219),\nallowing us to understand one\u2019s existence in light of their\nfundamental free choice of themselves.\n\nThe very idea of a psychoanalysis oriented towards the study of\nconsciousness rather than the unconscious seems paradoxical\u2014a\nparadox increased by Sartre\u2019s efforts to highlight the\nfundamental differences that oppose his own version of psychoanalysis\nto Freud\u2019s. Sartre contends that Freud\u2019s\n\u201cempirical\u201d psychoanalysis \n\n\nis based on the hypothesis of the existence of an unconscious psyche,\nwhich on principle escapes the intuition of the subject. \n\n\nBy contrast, Sartre\u2019s own existential psychoanalysis aims to\nremain faithful to one of the earliest claims of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology: that all psychic acts are \u201ccoextensive with\nconsciousness\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 570]). For Sartre, however,\nthe basic motivation for rejecting Freud\u2019s hypothesis is less an\ninheritance of Brentano\u2019s descriptive psychology (as was the\ncase for Husserl) than a consequence of Sartre\u2019s fundamental\ncritique of determinism, applied to the naturalist presuppositions of\nempirical psychoanalysis and the particular kind of determinism that\nit involves. In agreement with Freud, Sartre holds that psychic life\nremains inevitably \u201copaque\u201d and at least somewhat\nimpenetrable to us. He also stresses that the philosophical\nunderstanding of human reality requires a method for investigating the\nmeaning of psychic facts. But Sartre denies that the methods\nand causal laws of the natural sciences are of any help in that\nrespect. The human psyche cannot be fully analysed and\nexplained as a mere result of external constraints acting\nlike physical forces or natural causes. The for-itself, being always\nwhat it is not and not what it is, remains free whatever the external\nand social constraints. Sartre is consequently bound to reject any\nemphasis on the causal impact of the past upon the present, which he\nargues is the basic methodological framework of empirical\npsychoanalysis. That does not mean that past psychic or physical facts\nhave no impact on one\u2019s existence whatsoever. Rather, Sartre\ncontends that the impact of past events is determined in relation to\none\u2019s present choice, and understood as the consequence of the\npower invested in this free choice. As he puts it: \n\n\nSince the force of compulsion in my past is borrowed from my free,\nreflecting choice and from the very power which this choice has given\nitself, it is impossible to determine a priori the compelling power of\na past. (Sartre 1943 [1956: 503])\n\n\nPast events bear no other meaning than the one given by a subject, in\nagreement with the free project that orients his or her existence\ntowards the future. Conversely, determinist explanations that construe\none\u2019s present as a mere consequence of the past proceed from a\nkind of self-delusion that operates by concealing one\u2019s free\nproject, and thus contributes to the obliteration of responsibility.\nSartre hence seeks to redefine the scope of psychoanalysis: rather\nthan a proper explanation of human behaviour that relies on the\nidentification of the laws of its causation, psychoanalysis consists\nin understanding the meaning of our conducts in light of one\u2019s\nproject of existence and free choice. One might wonder, then, why we\nneed any such psychoanalysis, if the existential project that\nconstitutes its object is freely chosen by the subject. Sartre\naddresses this objection in Being and Nothingness, claiming\nthat \n\n\nif the fundamental project is fully experienced by the subject and\nhence wholly conscious, that certainly does not mean that it must by\nthe same token be known by him; quite the contrary. (Sartre 1943\n[1956: 570])\n\n\nWhat Freud calls the unconscious must be redescribed as the\nparadoxical entanglement of a \u201ctotal absence of knowledge\u201d\ncombined with a \u201ctrue understanding\u201d (r\u00e9elle\ncomprehension) of oneself (1972, Sit. IX: 111). The\nlegitimacy of Sartre\u2019s existential psychoanalysis of\nconsciousness lies in its ability to unveil the original project\naccording to which one chooses (more or less obscurely) to develop the\nfundamental orientations of their existence. According to Sartre,\nanalysing a human subject and understanding the meaning that orients\ntheir existence as a whole requires that we grasp the specific kind of\nunity that lies behind their various attitudes and conducts. This\nunity can only appear once we discover the synthetic principle of\nunification or \u201ctotalization\u201d (totalisation) that\ncommands the whole of their behaviours. Sartre understands this\ntotalization as an an-going process that covers the entire course of\none\u2019s existence, a process which is constantly reassumed so as\nto integrate the new developments of this existence. For this reason,\nthis never ending process of totalization cannot be fully\nself-conscious or the object of reflective self-knowledge. The\nsynthetic principle that makes this totalization possible is\nidentified by Sartre in terms of fundamental choice: existential\npsychoanalysis describes human subjects as synthetic totalities in\nwhich every attitude, conduct, or behaviour finds its meaning in\nrelation to the unity of a primary choice, which all of the\nsubject\u2019s behaviour expresses in its own way.\n\nAll human behaviour can thus be described as a secondary\nparticularisation of a fundamental project which expresses the\nsubject\u2019s free choice, and conditions the intelligibility of\ntheir actions. On the basis of his diagnosis of Baudelaire\u2019s\nexistential project, for instance, Sartre goes as far as to claim that\nhe is \u201cprepared to wager that he preferred meats cooked in\nsauces to grills, preserves to fresh vegetables\u201d (Sartre 1947a\n[1967: 113]). Sartre legitimates such a daring statement by showing\nits logical connection to Baudelaire\u2019s irresistible hatred for\nnature, from which his gastronomic preferences must derive, and which\nSartre identifies as the expression of the initial free choice of\nhimself that commands the whole of the French po\u00e8te\nmaudit\u2019s existence. In Sartre\u2019s words: \n\n\nHe chose to exist for himself as he was for others. He wanted his\nfreedom to appear to himself like a \u201cnature\u201d; and he\nwanted this \u201cnature\u201d which others discovered in him to\nappear to them like the very emanation of his freedom. From that point\neverything becomes clear. [\u2026] We should look in vain for a\nsingle circumstance for which he was not fully and consciously\nresponsible. Every event was a reflection of that indecomposable\ntotality which he was from the first to the last day of his life\n(Sartre 1947a [1967: 191\u2013192]).\n\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s choice of himself both accounts for the\nsubject\u2019s freedom (insofar as it has been freely accepted as the\nsubject\u2019s own project of existence) and exerts a constraint on\nparticular behaviours and attitudes towards the world, so that he is\nbound to act and behave in a way that must be compatible with that\nchoice. Although absolutely free, such an initial choice takes the\nshape and the meaning of an inescapable and relentless\ndestiny\u2014a destiny in which one\u2019s sense of freedom\nand their inability to act in any other way than they actually did\ncome to merge perfectly: \u201cthe free choice which a man makes of\nhimself is completely identified with what is called his\ndestiny\u201d (Sartre 1947a [1967: 192]).\n\nIn the years following the publication of Being and\nNothingness, Sartre refines this original conception of\nexistential psychoanalysis. He applies it methodically to the\nbiographical analysis of a series of major French writers (Baudelaire\nfirst, then Mallarm\u00e9, Jean Gen\u00eat, Flaubert, and himself\nin Words), warning against the dangers of all kinds of\ndeterminist interpretations, from the constitution of psychological\ntypes to materialist explanations inherited from Marxian historical\nanalyses. Sartre\u2019s analyses become more subtle over time, as he\nsubstitutes fine-grained descriptions of the concrete constraints that\nframe and shape the limits of human lives to the strongly metaphysical\ntheses on freedom that he was first tempted to apply indistinctly to\neach of these writers. Accordingly, existential psychoanalysis plays a\ncentral role in the development of Sartre\u2019s thought from the\nearly 40s up to his last published work on Flaubert. It allows him to\nunify and articulate two fundamental threads of his philosophical\nthinking: his ontological analysis of the absolute freedom of the\nfor-itself in Being and Nothingness; and his later attempt to\ntake into consideration the social, historical and political factors\nthat are inevitably involved in the determination of one\u2019s free\nchoice of their own existence. Already in his War Diaries\nfrom 1940, the method of analysis of \u201chuman reality\u201d\narises from Sartre\u2019s attempt to understand rather than\nexplain (according to Dilthey\u2019s famous distinction) Emperor\nWilhelm II\u2019s historical situation and its relation to the\naspects of his personal life that express his specific way of\nbeing-in-the-world (Sartre 1983b [1984: 308\u2013309]). The\napplication of his method to the specific cases of these French\nwriters allowed him to refine the ahistorical descriptions of his\nearlier work, by bringing the analysis of the subject\u2019s freedom\nback to the material/historical conditions (both internal and\nexternal) of constitution of their particular modes of existing.\n\nSartre\u2019s inquiries into existential psychoanalysis also\nanticipate and intersect with his philosophical investigations on\nhistorical anthropology. The progressive-regressive method presented\nin Search for a Method and Critique of Dialectical\nReason (Sartre 1960a [1976]) was first sketched and experimented\nthrough Sartre\u2019s essays in existential psychoanalysis.\nSartre\u2019s detailed analyses of Flaubert\u2019s biography in\nThe Family Idiot can be read as synthesising the\nhermeneutical methodology theorised in Search for A Method\nand the conception of the freedom involved in one\u2019s initial\nchoice of themselves that arose from Being and Nothingness.\nMoving discretely away from an all-too metaphysical doctrine of\nabsolute freedom, Sartre goes back to the most concrete details of\nFlaubert\u2019s material conditions of existence in order to account\nfor the specific way in which Flaubert made himself able, through the\nwriting of his novels, to overcome his painful situation as a\n\u201cfrustrated and jealous younger brother\u201d and\n\u201cunloved child\u201d thanks to a totalizing project that made\nhim \u201cthe author of Madame Bovary\u201d (Sartre\n1971\u201372 [1987, vol. 2: 7]). If Flaubert\u2019s novel and\nmasterpiece is consequently understood and described as the final\nobjectivation of Gustave\u2019s fundamental project, Sartre is now\ncareful to point out the economic, historic and social conditions\nwithin which this project only finds its full intelligibility.\nSartre\u2019s psychoanalytic method is then expected to reveal,\nbeyond what society has made of Flaubert, what he himself could make\nof what society has made of him. In order to fly away from the painful\nreality of his unbearable familial situation, the young Gustave\nchooses irreality over reality, and chooses it freely, though\nachingly. From that moment on, his dedication to literature commits\nhim to a fictional world that he couldn\u2019t but choose to elect as\nthe realm of his genius.\n6. Existentialist Marxism: Critique of Dialectical Reason\n\nWhile Search for a Method (1957) had been published earlier,\nit is not until 1960 that Sartre completed the first\nvolume\u2014\u201cTheory of Practical Ensembles\u201d\u2014of what\nis his final systematic work of philosophy, Critique of\nDialectical Reason. The second volume, \u201cThe Intelligibility\nof History\u201d, was published posthumously in French in 1985. It\nwould be 1991 before both volumes were to be available in English,\nwhich goes some of the way towards explaining their subsequent\nneglect. It is also a book that rivals Being and Nothingness\nfor difficulty, even if some of its goals and ambitions can be\nexpressed straightforwardly enough. Never a member of the French\nCommunist Party, Sartre nonetheless begins by laying his Marxist cards\non the table: \n\n\nwe were convinced at one and the same time that historical materialism\nfurnished the only valid interpretation of history and that\nexistentialism remained the only concrete approach to reality. (Sartre\n1957 [1963: 21]) \n\n\nCritique offers a systematic attempt to justify these two\nperspectives and render them compatible. In broad terms, some of the\nmain steps needed to effect such a synthesis are clear, most notably\nto deny or limit strong structuralist and determinist versions of\nMarxism. Borrowing some themes from Merleau-Ponty\u2019s Humanism\nand Terror, Sartre maintained that any genuinely dialectical\nmethod refuses to reduce; it refuses scientific and economic\ndeterminism that treats humans as things, contrary to reductive\nversions of Marxism. He pithily puts his objection to such\nexplanations in terms of what we might today call the genetic fallacy.\nSartre says, \n\n\nValery is a petit bourgeois intellectual, no doubt about it. But not\nevery petit bourgeois intellectual is Valery. The heuristic inadequacy\nof contemporary Marxism is contained in these two sentences. (Sartre\n1957 [1963: 56]) \n\n\nMoreover, for Sartre, class struggle is not the only factor that\ndetermines and orients history and the field of possibilities. There\nis human choice and commitment in class formation that is equally\nfundamental. The way in which this plays out in Critique is\nthrough an emphasis on praxis rather than consciousness, which we have\nseen is also characteristic of his existential psychoanalytic work of\nthe prior decade.\n\nWithout being able to adequately summarise the vast Critique\nhere (see Flynn 1984), one of the book\u2019s core conceptual\ninnovations is the idea of the practico-inert. Sartre defines this as\n\u201cthe activity of others insofar as it is sustained and diverted\nby inorganic inertia\u201d (Sartre 1960a [1976: 556]). The concept is\nintended to capture the forms of social and historical sedimentation\nthat had only minimally featured in Being and Nothingness. It\nis the reign of necessity, \n\n\nthe domain \u2026 in which inorganic materiality envelops human\nmultiplicity and transforms the producer into its product. (Sartre\n1960a [1976: 339]) \n\n\nFor Sartre, the practico-inert is the negation of humanity. Any\nreaffirmation of humanity, in which genuine freedom resides, must take\nthe form of the negation of this negation (negation is productive\nhere, as it also was in Being and Nothingness). For Sartre,\nthen, there are two fundamental kinds of social reality: a positive\none in which an active group constitutes the common field; and a\nnegative one in which individuals are effectively separated from each\nother (even though they appear united) in a practico-inert field. In\nthe practico-inert field, relations are typified by what Sartre calls\nseriality, like a number, or a worker in a factory who is allocated to\na place within a given system that is indifferent to the individual.\nSartre\u2019s prime example of this is of waiting for a bus, or\nstreet-car, on the way to work. If the people involved do not know\neach other reasonably well there is likely to be a kind of anonymity\nto such experiences in which individuals are substitutable for each\nother in relation to this imminent bus, and their relations are\norganised around functional need. If the bus is late, or if there are\ntoo many people on it, however, those who are waiting go from being\nindifferent and anonymous (something akin to what Heidegger calls\ndas Man in Being and Time) to becoming competitors\nand rivals. In a related spirit Sartre also discusses the serial unity\nof the TV watching public, of the popular music charts, bourgeois\nproperty, and petty racism and stereotyping as well. These collective\nobjects keep serial individuals apart from one another under the\npretext of unifying them. Sartre thus appears to accept a version of\nthe Marxian theses concerning commodity fetishism. This competitive or\nantagonistic dimension of the practico-inert is amplified in\nsituations of material scarcity. This kind of seriality is argued to\nbe the basic type of sociality, thus transforming the focus on dyadic\nconsciousnesses of Being and Nothingness. In the\nCritique, otherness becomes produced not simply through the\nlook that Sartre had previously described as the original meaning of\nbeing-for-others, but through the sedimentation of social processes\nand through practico-inert mediation. Society produces in us serial\nbehaviour, serial feelings, serial thoughts, and \u201cpassive\nactivity\u201d (Sartre 1960a [1976: 266]), where events and history\nare conceived as external occurrences that befall us, and we feel\ncompelled by the force of circumstance, or \u201cmonstrous\nforces\u201d as Sartre puts it. It is the practico-inert, modified by\nmaterial and economic scarcity, which turns us into conflictual\ncompetitors and alienates us from each other and ourselves. Only an\nend to both material scarcity and the alienating mediation of the\npractico-inert will allow for the actualisation of socialism.\n\nWhile Sartre is pessimistic about the prospects for any sort of\npermanent revolution of society, he maintains that we get a fleeting\nglimpse of this unalienated condition in the experience of the\n\u201cgroup in fusion\u201d. This occurs when the members of a group\nrelate to each other through praxis and in a particular way. The group\nin fusion is not a collective \u00e0 la the practico-inert,\nbut a social whole that spontaneously forms as a plurality of serial\nindividuals respond to some danger, pressing situation, or to the\nlikelihood of a collective reaction to their stance (Flynn 1984: 114).\nWe could consider what happens when an individual acts so as to make\nmanifest this serial otherness, like Rosa Parkes when she refused to\ngive up her seat and thus drew attention to the specific nature of the\ncolonialist seriality at the heart of many states in the USA. This\nsometimes creates a rupture and others might follow. Sartre\u2019s\nown prime example is of a crowd of workers who were fleeing during the\nFrench Revolution in 1789. At some point the workers stopped fleeing,\nturned around and reversed direction, suddenly energised alongside\neach other by their practical awareness that they were doing something\ntogether. For this kind of \u201cfusion\u201d to happen it must\nfulfil the following four key conditions for genuine reciprocity that\nFlynn summarises as follows:\n\nThat the other be a means to the exact degree that I am a means\nmyself, i.e., that he be the means towards a transcendent goal and not\nmy means;\nThat I recognize the other as praxis at the same time as I\nintegrate him into my totalizing project;\nThat I recognize his movement towards his own ends in the very\nmovement by which I project myself towards mine;\nThat I discover myself as an object and instrument of his own ends\nby the same act that makes him an object and instrument of mine.\n(Flynn 1984: 115, also see previous version of this entry [Flynn 2004\n[2013]] and cf. Sartre 1960a [1976: 112\u20133]).\n\n\nSartre calls the resurrection of this freedom an\n\u201capocalypse\u201d, indicating that it is an unforeseen and\n(potentially) revolutionary event that happens when serial abuse and\nexploitation can no longer be tolerated. The group in fusion has a\nmaximum of praxis and a minimum of inertia, but serial sociality has\nthe reverse.\n\nUnfortunately, Sartre insists that this group in fusion is destined to\nmeet with what he calls an \u201contological check\u201d in the form\nof the institution, which cannot be escaped as some versions of\nanarchism and Marxism might hope. The group relapses into seriality\nwhen groups are formalised into hierarchical institutional structures.\nSerial otherness comes to implicate itself in interpersonal relations\nin at least three ways in the institution: sovereignty; authority; and\nbureaucracy (see Book 2, Chapter 6, \u201cThe Institution\u201d).\nFrom the co-sovereignty of the group in fusion, someone inevitably\nbecomes sovereign in any new social order. Similarly, a\ncommand-obedience relation comes about in institutions, to greater and\nlesser extents, and there will be exhortations to company loyalty, to\ndo one\u2019s duty, etc. (Flynn 1984: 120). Bureaucratic rules and\nregulation also inevitably follow, partly as a reaction to fear of\nsovereignty, and this installs what Sartre calls vertical\notherness\u2014top-down hierarchies, as opposed to the horizontal and\nimmanent organisation of the group in fusion (Sartre 1960a [1976:\n655\u2013663]). As such, the revolutionary force of the group in\nfusion is necessarily subject to mediation by the practico-inert, as\nwell as the problems associated with institutionality just described.\nAlthough is it still structured through a series of oppositions, the\nCritique delivers a sophisticated social ontology that both\naddresses some weaknesses in Sartre\u2019s earlier work and unifies\nthe social and political reflections of much of his later work.\n7. Politics and Anti-Colonialism\n\nAlthough it is not possible to address all of Sartre\u2019s rich and\nvaried contributions to ethics and politics here, we will introduce\nsome of the key ideas about race and anti-colonialism that were\nimportant themes in his post Being and Nothingness work and\nare currently significant issues in our times. Sartre was generally\nstridently anti-colonialist, perhaps even advocating a\nmulticulturalism avant la lettre, as Michael Walzer has\nargued in his Preface to Anti-semite and Jew (Walzer 1995:\nxiv). His books and more journalistic writings typically call out what\nhe saw as the bad faith of many French and European citizens.\n\nThe issue of race was part of Sartre\u2019s French intellectual\nscene, and Sartre himself played a major role in facilitating that in\nthe pages of Les Temps Modernes, L\u2019Express,\nand elsewhere. Debates about the intersection of philosophy and race,\nand colonialism and multiculturalism, were all being had. These\nconcerned not only the French Algerian and African\n\u201ccolonies\u201d but also Vietnam via Tran Duc Thao, who had\nchallenged Sartre\u2019s efforts to bring phenomenological\nexistentialism together with Marxism. Initially at least,\nSartre\u2019s arguments here typically drew on and extended some of\nthe categories deployed in Being and Nothingness. There is an\nobvious sense in which a critique of racism automatically ensues from\nSartrean existentialism. Racism is a form of bad faith, for Sartre,\nsince it typically (perhaps necessarily) involves believing in\nessences or types, and indeed constructing essences and types. His\nNotebooks suggest that all oppression rests on bad faith. In\nracism, in particular, there is an \u201cinfernal circle of\nirresponsible responsibility, of culpable ignorance and ignorance\nwhich is knowledge\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956: 49]),\nas well as what Sartre calls\npassive complicity. Many of us (or Sartre\u2019s own French society)\nmay not obviously be bigots, but we sustain a system that is\nobjectively unjust through our choices and sometimes wilful ignorance.\nIn relation to colonialism, Sartre likewise contends that we have all\nprofited from colonialist exploitation and sustained its systems, even\nif we are not ourselves a \u201csettler\u201d.\n\nThis is also the key argument of Anti-semite and the Jew,\ncomposed very quickly in 1944 and without much detailed knowledge of\nJudaism but with more direct knowledge of the sort of passive\nanti-semitism of many French citizens. The text was written following\nthe Dreyfus affair and before all of the horrors of the holocaust were\nwidely known. Sartre was aiming to understand (and critique) the\nsituation he observed around him, in which the imminent return of the\nFrench Jews exiled by the Nazis was not unambiguously welcomed by all.\nThe book is perceptive about its prime targets, the explicit or\nimplicit anti-semite, who defines the real Frenchmen by excluding\nothers, notably the Jew. Now, of course, few of his contemporaries\nwould admit to being anti-semites, just as few would admit to being\nracist. But there are patterns of bad faith that Sartre thinks are\nclear: we participate in social systems that force the dilemma of\nauthenticity or inauthenticity upon the Jew, asking them to choose\nbetween their concrete practical identities (religious and cultural)\nand more universal ascriptions (liberty, etc.) in a way that cannot be\nreadily navigated within the terms of the debate. Sartre consistently\nascribes responsibility to collectives here, even if those collectives\nare ultimately sustained by individual decisions and choices. For him,\nit is not just the assassin say, nor just Eichmann and the Nazi\nregime, who are held responsible. Rather, these more obviously\negregious activities were sustained by their society and the\nindividuals in it, through culpable ignorance and patterns of bad\nfaith.\n\nSartre also addressed the negritude movement in his Preface to\nBlack Orpheus (1948), an anthology of negritude poetry. He\ncalled for an anti-racist racism and saw himself as resolutely on the\nside of the negritude movement, but he also envisaged such\ninterventions as a step towards ultimately revealing the category of\nrace itself as an example of bad faith. Here the reception from Frantz\nFanon and others was mixed. In Black Skin, White Masks\n(1952), Fanon argues this effectively undermined his own\nlived-experience and its power (see entries on\n negritude\n and\n Fanon;\n cf. also Gordon 1995). Sartre continued to address colonialism and\nracism in subsequent work, effecting a rapprochement of sorts with\nFanon that culminated in his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nFanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth (1961), where also\nSartre appears to endorse a counter-violence. \n\nAlthough we have not given much attention to Sartre\u2019s literary\nand artistic productions since\n section 3\n above, he continued to produce artistic work of political\nsignificance throughout his career. Continuous with insights from his\nWhat is Literature?, Sartre argues that in a society that\nremains unjust and dominated by oppression, the prose-writer (if not\nthe poet) must combat this violence by jolting the reader and audience\nfrom their complacency, rather than simply be concerned with art for\nits own sake. His literary works hence are typically both\nphilosophical and political. Although the number of these works\ndiminished over time, there is still a powerful literary exploration\nof the philosophical and political themes of the Critique in\nthe play, The Condemned of Altona (1960).\n\nWe cannot neatly sum up a public intellectual and man of letters, like\nSartre, to conclude. We do think, however, that it is arguable, with\nthe benefit of hindsight, that some of Sartre\u2019s interventions\nare prescient rather than outmoded remnants of the nineteenth century\n(\u00e0 la Foucault). They certainly presage issues that\nare in the foreground today, concerning class, race, and gender. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that Sartre got it all correct, of course, whatever\nthat might mean in regard to the complex realities of socio-political\nlife. Indeed, if one is to take a stand on so many of the major\nsocio-political issues of one\u2019s time, as Sartre did, it is\ninevitable that history will not look kindly on them all.\nSartre\u2019s life and writings hence present a complex and difficult\ninterpretive task, but they remain a powerful provocation for thought\nand action today.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
