    "main_text": "Distal Theories of Sounds\n3. Distal Theories of Sounds\n\nAfter proximal and medial theories, one should consider another\ncandidate for the physical identification of sounds, namely distal\nproperties, processes or events in the medium inside (or at the\nsurface of) sounding objects, or in the stuff of the sounding object.\nDistal views claim their superiority to non-distal competitors in\nvirtue of their adherence to the spatial structure of auditory\ncontent. As we have seen, we do hear sounds both as externalized\n(hence auditory content is at odds with proximal views) and as\ndistally located (hence auditory content is at odds with medial\nviews).\n\nThere exist at least four varieties of the distal account of sounds:\nthe Property Theory, the Located Event Theory, the Relational Event\nTheory, and the Dispositional Theory. These accounts all subscribe to\nthe idea that sounds are distally located, but they differ in\nascribing to sounds different ontological status. Let us take them in\nturn.\n",
