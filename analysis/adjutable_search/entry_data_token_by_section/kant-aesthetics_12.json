    "main_text": "Teleology || The Notion of Purposiveness\n3.1 The Notion of Purposiveness\n\nThe notions of purpose or end [Zweck] and of purposiveness\n[Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit] are defined by Kant in the\n\u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d, in a section entitled\n\u201cOn Purposiveness in General\u201d (\u00a710). A purpose is\n\u201cthe object of a concept, in so far as the concept is seen as\nthe cause of the object\u201d, and purposiveness is \u201cthe\ncausality of a concept with respect to its object\u201d (\u00a710,\n220). But Kant often uses the terms \u201cpurpose\u201d and\n\u201cpurposive\u201d in ways that are related to, but do not quite\nfit, these definitions. In particular \u201cpurpose\u201d is\nsometimes used to apply to the concept rather than the corresponding\nobject (e.g., Introduction IV, 180), and \u201cpurposiveness\u201d\nis usually used to denote, not the causality of the concept, but the\nproperty in virtue of which an object counts as a purpose (e.g., FI\nIX, 234). Kant also characterizes \u201cpurposiveness\u201d as the\n\u201clawfulness of the contingent as such\u201d (FI VI, 217; see\nalso FI VIII, 228, Introduction V, 184, and \u00a776, 404).\n\nKant\u2019s initial definition at \u00a710 suggests that the paradigm\nof a purpose is a human artifact, since this typically comes into\nbeing as a result of the artisan\u2019s having a concept of the\nobject he or she plans to produce, a concept which is thus causally\nefficacious in producing its object. Such an object is the result of\ndesign. But Kant goes on to claim that something can qualify as a\npurpose, or as purposive, not only if it is in fact brought about as a\nresult of design, but if we can conceive its possibility only on the\nassumption that it was produced according to design:\n\n\nan object or a state of mind or even an action\u2026 is called\npurposive merely because its possibility can only be explained and\nconceived by us in so far as we assume at its ground a causality in\naccordance with purposes. (\u00a710, 220)\n\n\nKant thinks that this is the case in particular for organisms, which\nare \u201cnatural purposes\u201d (see\n Section 3.3\n below). But the notion of purposiveness also applies more broadly,\nand Kant distinguishes various different kinds of purposiveness\napplying not only to organisms and artifacts, but also to beautiful\nobjects, to nature as a whole (both in so far as it is comprehensible\nto human beings, and in so far as it is a system of purposes standing\nin purposive relations to one another), to the functioning of our\ncognitive faculties in aesthetic appreciation and empirical scientific\nenquiry, to geometrical figures, and even to objects that are useful\nor agreeable to human beings.\n\nBecause Kant\u2019s terminology is not always consistent, it is\ndifficult to provide a definitive characterization of the various\ntypes of purposiveness. However, the following simplified scheme may\nserve as a guide. The notion of purposiveness is divided in the first\ninstance into subjective and objective\npurposiveness. Both kinds of purposiveness are in turn divided into\nformal and material (or real). The most\nimportant kinds of purposiveness for the concerns of the Critique\nof Judgment are (i) subjective formal purposiveness and (ii)\nobjective material purposiveness. Subjective formal purposiveness\ncorresponds both to the \u201caesthetic\u201d purposiveness\ndisplayed by beautiful objects (or by the activity of our cognitive\nfaculties in the perception of them) and to the \u201clogical\u201d\npurposiveness displayed by nature as a whole in so far as it is\ncomprehensible to human beings (see\n Section 3.2).\n Objective material purposiveness corresponds to the purposiveness\ndisplayed both by organisms qua \u201cnatural purposes\u201d (see\n Section 3.3)\n and by arrangements of natural things or processes which stand to one\nanother in means-end relations (see\n Section 3.5).\n But Kant also allows for subjective material purposiveness, which is\nthe kind of purposiveness exhibited by an agreeable object, i.e., one\nwhich pleases our senses (FI VIII, 224); and for objective formal\npurposiveness, which is exhibited by geometrical figures in virtue of\ntheir fruitfulness for solving mathematical problems (\u00a762).\n\nA further important distinction is that between objective material\npurposiveness which is inner, and objective material\npurposiveness which is merely outer or relative;\nthis distinguishes the kind of purposiveness possessed by organisms\nfrom that in virtue of which one natural thing or process stands in a\nmeans-end relation to another. Kant also claims in one passage (FI\nXII, 249\u2013250) that the distinction between inner and relative\npurposiveness applies to subjective as well as objective\npurposiveness, serving to separate the beautiful from the sublime.\n\nThe distinctions among these various kinds of purposiveness are\ntreated in detail by Marc-Wogau (1938) and Tonelli (1958).\n\nCommentators have disagreed about whether there is any underlying\nphilosophical unity to Kant\u2019s notion of purposiveness, and, in\nparticular, whether the notion of purposiveness which figures in the\naesthetic context is the same as that which figures in Kant\u2019s\naccount of organisms. Guyer takes Kant to be operating with two\ndifferent senses of \u201cpurposiveness\u201d, one applying to\nartifacts (and, presumably, organisms), the other applying to objects\nof aesthetic appreciation. While purposiveness in the former sense\ncorresponds to Kant\u2019s account of purposiveness at \u00a710 in\nterms of the notion of design, the notion of purposiveness as it\napplies to beautiful objects does not involve the idea of real or\napparent design, but simply that of the satisfaction of an aim or\nobjective (1979 [1997: 190ff]; see also 1993: 417n.39).\n\nAn opposing view is defended in Ginsborg 1997b, which draws on\nKant\u2019s characterization of purposiveness as the\n\u201clawfulness of the contingent as such\u201d (FI VI, 20:217; see\nalso FI VIII, 20:228; Introduction V, 5:184; and \u00a776, 5:404) to\nargue for a univocal conception on which purposiveness is understood\nas normative lawfulness. Zuckert also lays emphasis on Kant\u2019s\nidentification of purposiveness as the \u201clawfulness of the\ncontingent\u201d (2007a: 5\u20137), but rejects Ginsborg\u2019s\nview that this in turn amounts to normative lawfulness as such (2007a:\n84n28); on her view, the lawfulness of the contingent is to be\nunderstood as \u201cthe unity of the diverse\u201d (2007a: 5) or the\n\u201cform of unity of diversity as such\u201d (2007a: 15). The\nnormative conception of purposiveness is also criticized by Teufel\n(2011), who argues that Kant held an etiological and non-teleological\nconception of purposiveness: on Teufel\u2019s view, an ascription of\npurposiveness to an object makes an ontological claim to the effect\nthat the object is the outcome of a rational, conceptually guided\nprocess. Breitenbach (2017) and Fisher (forthcoming)  agree with\nGinsborg in emphasizing Kant\u2019s characterization of purposiveness\nin terms of the lawfulness of the contingent, but without endorsing\nGinsborg\u2019s interpretation of the lawfulness as normative.\n",
