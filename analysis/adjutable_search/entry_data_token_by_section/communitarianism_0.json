    "main_text": "Universalism Versus Particularism\n1. Universalism Versus Particularism\n\nCommunitarians have sought to deflate the universal pretensions of\nliberal theory. The main target has been Rawls description of the\noriginal position as an \u201cArchimedean point\u201d from which the\nstructure of a social system can be appraised, a position whose\nspecial virtue is that it allows us to regard the human condition\n\u201cfrom the perspective of\n eternity\u201d,[3]\n from all social and temporal points of view. Whereas Rawls seemed to\npresent his theory of justice as universally true, communitarians\nargued that the standards of justice must be found in forms of life\nand traditions of particular societies and hence can vary from context\nto context. Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor argued that moral\nand political judgment will depend on the language of reasons and the\ninterpretive framework within which agents view their world, hence\nthat it makes no sense to begin the political enterprise by\nabstracting from the interpretive dimensions of human beliefs,\npractices, and institutions (Taylor 1985, ch. 1; MacIntyre 1978,\nchs.18\u201322 and 1988, ch.1; Benhabib 1992, pp. 23\u201338, 89n4).\nMichael Walzer developed the additional argument that effective social\ncriticism must derive from and resonate with the habits and traditions\nof actual people living in specific times and places. Even if there is\nnothing problematic about a formal procedure of universalizability\nmeant to yield a determinate set of human goods and values, \u201cany\nsuch set would have to be considered in terms so abstract that they\nwould be of little use in thinking about particular\ndistributions\u201d (Walzer 1983, 8; Young 1990, 4). In short,\nliberals who ask what is just by abstracting from particular social\ncontexts are doomed to philosophical incoherence and liberal theorists\nwho adopt this method to persuade people to do the just thing are\ndoomed to political irrelevance.\n\nRawls has since tried to eliminate the universalist presuppositions\nfrom his theory. In Political Liberalism, (Rawls 1993) he\nargues in a communitarian vein that his conception of the person as\nimpartial citizen provides the best account of liberal-democratic\npolitical culture and that his political aim is only to work out the\nrules for consensus in political communities where people are willing\nto try for consensus. In the Law of Peoples, (Rawls 1999) he\nexplicitly allows for the possibility that liberalism may not be\nexportable at all times and places, sketching a vision of a\n\u201cdecent, well-ordered society\u201d that liberal societies must\ntolerate in the international realm. Such a society, he argues, need\nnot be democratic, but it must be non-aggressive towards other\ncommunities, and internally it must have a \u201ccommon good\nconception of justice\u201d, a \u201creasonable consultation\nhierarchy\u201d, and it must secure basic human rights. Having said\nthat, one still gets the sense that the liberal vision laid out in\nA Theory of Justice is the best possible political ideal, one\nthat all rational individuals would want if they were able to choose\nbetween the available political alternatives. There may be justifiable\nnon-liberal regimes, but these should be regarded as second best to be\ntolerated and perhaps respected, not idealized or emulated.\n\nOther liberal theorists have taken a harder line against communitarian\nconcessions, arguing that liberal theory can and should present itself\nas a universally valid ideal. Brian Barry, for one, opens his widely\ncited book Justice as Impartiality by boldly affirming the\nuniversality of his theory: \u201cI continue to believe in the\npossibility of putting forward a universally valid case in favor of\nliberal egalitarian principles\u201d (Barry 1995, 3). Barry does\nrecognize that a theory of justice must be anchored in substantive\nmoral considerations, but his normative vision appears to be limited\nto the values and practices of liberal Western societies. He seems\ndistinctly uninterested in learning anything worthwhile from\nnon-Western political traditions: for example, his discussion of\nthings Chinese is confined to brief criticisms of the Cultural\nRevolution and the traditional practice of foot-binding. One might\nconsider the reaction to a Chinese intellectual who puts forward a\nuniversal theory of justice that draws on the Chinese political\ntradition for inspiration and completely ignores the history and moral\nargumentation in Western societies, except for brief criticisms of\nslavery and imperialism.\n\nStill, it must be conceded that 1980s communitarian theorists were\nless-than-successful at putting forward attractive visions of\nnon-liberal societies. The communitarian case for pluralism for the\nneed to respect and perhaps learn from non-liberal societies that may\nbe as good as, if not better than, the liberal societies of the West\nmay have been unintentionally undermined by their own use of (counter)\nexamples. In After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre defended the\nAristotelian ideal of the intimate, reciprocating local community\nbound by shared ends, where people simply assume and fulfill socially\ngiven roles (MacIntyre 1984). But this pre-modern Gemeinschaft\nconception of an all-encompassing community that members\nunreflectively endorse seemed distinctly ill-suited for complex and\nconflict-ridden large-scale industrialized societies. In Spheres\nof Justice, Michael Walzer pointed to the Indian caste system,\n\u201cwhere the social meanings are integrated and\nhierarchical\u201d (Walzer 1983, 313) as an example of a non-liberal\nsociety that may be just according to its own standards. Not\nsurprisingly, few readers were inspired by this example of non-liberal\njustice (not to mention the fact that many contemporary Indian\nthinkers view the caste system as an unfortunate legacy of the past\nthat Indians should strive hard to overcome). In short, this use of\nill-informed examples may have unintentionally reinforced the view\nthat there are few if any justifiable alternatives to liberalism in\nmodern societies. Communitarians could score some theoretical points\nby urging liberal thinkers to be cautious about developing universal\narguments founded exclusively on the moral argumentation and political\nexperience of Western liberal societies, but few thinkers would really\ncontemplate the possibility of non-liberal practices appropriate for\nthe modern world so long as the alternatives to liberalism consisted\nof Golden Ages, caste societies, fascism, or actually-existing\ncommunism. For the communitarian critique of liberal universalism to\nhave any lasting credibility, thinkers need to provide compelling\ncounter-examples to modern-day liberal-democratic regimes and 1980s\ncommunitarians came up short.\n\nBy the 1990s, fairly abstract methodological disputes over\nuniversalism versus particularism faded from academic prominence, and\nthe debate now centers on the theory and practice of universal human\nrights. This is largely due to the increased political salience of\nhuman rights since the collapse of communism in the former Soviet\nbloc. On the liberal side, the new, more political voices for liberal\nuniversalism have been represented by the likes of Francis Fukuyama,\nwho famously argued that liberal democracy\u2019s triumph over its\nrivals signifies the end of history (Fukuama 1992). This view also\nrevived (and provoked) the second wave communitarian critique of\nliberal universalism and the debate became much more concrete and\npolitical in orientation.\n\nNeedless to say, the brief moment of liberal euphoria that followed\nthe collapse of the communism in the Soviet bloc has given way to a\nsober assessment of the difficulties of implementing liberal practices\noutside the Western world. It is now widely recognized that brutal\nethnic warfare, crippling poverty, environmental degradation, and\npervasive corruption, to name some of the more obvious troubles\nafflicting the developing world, pose serious obstacles to the\nsuccessful establishment and consolidation of liberal democratic\npolitical arrangements. But these were seen as unfortunate (hopefully\ntemporary) afflictions that may delay the end of history when liberal\ndemocracy has finally triumphed over its rivals. They were not meant\nto pose a challenge to the ideal of liberal democracy. It was\nwidely assumed that liberal democracy is something that all rational\nindividuals would want if they could get it.\n\nThe deeper challenge to Western liberal democracy has emerged from the\nEast Asian\n region.[4]\n In the 1990s, the debate revolved around the notion of \u201cAsian\nvalues\u201d, a term devised by several Asian officials and their\nsupporters for the purpose of challenging Western-style civil and\npolitical freedoms. Asians, they claim, place special emphasis upon\nfamily and social harmony, with the implication that those in the\nchaotic and crumbling societies of the West should think twice about\nintervening in Asia for the sake of promoting human rights and\ndemocracy. As Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew put it, Asians have\n\u201clittle doubt that a society with communitarian values where the\ninterests of society take precedence over that of the individual suits\nthem better than the individualism of\n America\u201d.[5]\n Such claims attracted international attention primarily because East\nAsian leaders seemed to be presiding over what a U.N. human\ndevelopment report called \u2018the most sustained and widespread\ndevelopment miracle of the twentieth century, perhaps all\n history\u2019.[6]\n In 1997\u201398, however, the East Asian miracle seemed to have\ncollapsed. And it looks like Asian values was one casualty of the\ncrisis.\n\nThe political factors that focused attention on the East Asian\nchallenge remain in place, however. East Asian economies did\neventually recover. China in particular looks set to become an\neconomic and political heavyweight with the power to seriously\nchallenge the hegemony of Western liberal democratic values in\ninternational fora (see Bell 2015). Thus, one hears frequent calls for\ncross-cultural dialogue between the West and the East designed to\nunderstand and perhaps learn from the other side. Failing to take\nseriously East Asian political perspectives risks widening\nmisunderstandings and setting the stage for hostilities that could\nhave been avoided.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, however, it must be conceded that\nthe official debate on Asian values has not provided much of a\nchallenge to dominant Western political outlooks. The main problem is\nthat the debate has been led by Asian leaders who seem to be motivated\nprimarily by political considerations, rather than by a sincere desire\nto make a constructive contribution to the debate on universalism\nversus particularism. Thus, it was easy to dismiss\u2014rightly so,\nin most cases\u2014the Asian challenge as nothing but a self-serving\nploy by government leaders to justify their authoritarian rule in the\nface of increasing demands for democracy at home and abroad.\n\nStill, it would be a mistake to assume that nothing of theoretical\nsignificance has emerged from East Asia. The debate on Asian values\nhas also prompted critical intellectuals in the region to reflect on\nhow they can locate themselves in a debate on human rights and\ndemocracy in which they had not previously played a substantial part.\nNeither wholly rejecting nor wholly endorsing the values and practices\nordinarily realized through a liberal democratic political regime,\nthese intellectuals are drawing on their own cultural traditions and\nexploring areas of commonality and difference with the West. Though\noften less provocative than the views of their governments in the\nsense that few argue for the wholesale rejection of Western-style\nliberal democracy with an East Asian alternative these unofficial East\nAsian viewpoints may offer more lasting contributions to the debate.\nLet me (briefly) note three relatively persuasive East Asian arguments\nfor cultural particularism that contrast with traditional Western\narguments for liberal universalism (see Bell 2006, ch. 3):\n\n\n\nCultural factors can affect the prioritizing of rights, and\nthis matters when rights conflict and it must be decided which one to\nsacrifice. In other words, different societies may rank rights\ndifferently, and even if they face a similar set of disagreeable\ncircumstances they may come to different conclusions about the right\nthat needs to be curtailed. For example, U.S. citizens may be more\nwilling to sacrifice a social or economic right in cases of conflict\nwith a civil or political right: if neither the constitution nor a\nmajority of democratically elected representatives support universal\naccess to health care, then the right to health care regardless of\nincome can be curtailed. In contrast, the Chinese may be more willing\nto sacrifice a civil or political liberty in cases of conflict with a\nsocial or economic right: there may be wide support for restrictions\non the right to form independent labor associations if they are\nnecessary to provide the conditions for economic development.\nDifferent priorities assigned to rights can also matter when it must\nbe decided how to spend scarce resources. For example, East Asian\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage will place great emphasis upon the\nvalue of education, and they may help to explain the large amount of\nspending on education compared to other societies with similar levels\nof economic development.\n\n\nCultural factors can affect the justification of rights. In\nline with the arguments of \u201c1980s communitarians\u201d such as\nMichael Walzer, it is argued that justifications for particular\npractices valued by Western-style liberal democrats should not be made\nby relying on the abstract and unhistorical universalism that often\ndisables Western liberal democrats. Rather, they should be made from\nthe inside, from specific examples and argumentative strategies that\nEast Asians themselves use in everyday moral and political debate. For\nexample, the moral language (shared even by some local critics of\nauthoritarianism) tends to appeal to the value of community in East\nAsia, and this is relevant for social critics concerned with practical\neffect. One such communitarian argument is that democratic rights in\nSingapore can be justified on the grounds that they contribute to\nstrengthening ties to such communities as the family and the nation\n(see below, section III).\n\n\nCultural factors can provide moral foundations for\ndistinctive political practices and institutions (or at least\ndifferent from those found in Western-style liberal democracies). In\nEast Asian societies influenced by Confucianism, for example, it is\nwidely held that children have a profound duty to care for elderly\nparents, a duty to be forsaken only in the most exceptional\n circumstances.[7]\n In political practice, it means that East Asian governments have an\nobligation to provide the social and economic conditions that\nfacilitate the realization of this duty. Political debate tends to\ncenter on the question of whether the right to filial piety is best\nrealized by means of a law that makes it mandatory for children to\nprovide financial support for elderly parents as in mainland China,\nJapan, and Singapore or whether the state should rely more on indirect\nmethods such as tax breaks and housing benefits that simply make\nat-home care for the elderly easier, as in Korea and Hong Kong. But\nthe argument that there is a pressing need to secure this duty in East\nAsia is not a matter of political controversy.\n\nThinkers influenced by East Asian cultural traditions such\nConfucianism have also argued for distinctive as-yet-unrealized\npolitical practices and institutions that draw on widely-held cultural\nvalues for inspiration. For example, the Chinese thinker Jiang Qing\nhas argued for a tricameral legislature appropriate for the Chinese\ncontext, with a meritocratic \u201cHouse of Exemplary Persons\u201d\nand a \u201cHouse of Cultural Continuity\u201d that would complement\nand balance a democratic legislature (Jiang 2012). Korean scholars\nHahm Chaihark and Jongryn Mo argue for the need to revive and adapt\nfor the contemporary era such Choson dynasty institutions as policy\nlectures and the Confucian censorate, traditional institutions that\nplayed the role of monitoring the dealings of the Emperor (Hahm\n(Chaihark) 2003, Mo 2003, Bell 2000, ch. 5). \n\n\nIn contrast to 1980s communitarian thinkers, East Asian critics of\nliberal universalism have succeeded in pointing to particular\nnon-liberal practices and institutions that may be appropriate for the\ncontemporary world. Some of these may be appropriate only for\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage, others may also offer insights\nfor mitigating the excesses of liberal modernity in the West. What\ncannot be denied is that they have carried forward the debate beyond\nthe implausible alternatives to liberalism offered by 1980s\ncommunitarian thinkers.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing, however, that contemporary communitarians\nhave not been merely defending parochial attachments to particular\nnon-liberal moralities. Far from arguing that the universalist\ndiscourse on human rights should be entirely displaced with\nparticular, tradition-sensitive political language, they have\ncriticized liberals for not taking universality seriously enough, for\nfailing to do what must be done to make human rights a truly universal\nideal. These communitarians\u2014let us label them the\n\u201ccosmopolitan critics of liberal universalism\u201d\u2014have\nsuggested various means of improving the philosophical coherence and\npolitical appeal of human rights.\n\nIn fact, there is little debate over the desirability of a core set of\nhuman rights, such as prohibitions against slavery, genocide, murder,\ntorture, prolonged arbitrary detention, and systematic racial\ndiscrimination. These rights have become part of international\ncustomary law, and they are not contested in the public rhetoric of\nthe international arena. Of course many gross violations occur off the\nrecord, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International have the\ntask of exposing the gap between public allegiance to rights and the\nsad reality of ongoing abuse. This is largely practical work, however.\nThere is not much point writing about or deliberating about the\ndesirability of practices that everyone condemns at the level of\nprinciple.\n\nBut political thinkers and activists around the world can and do take\ndifferent sides on many pressing human rights concerns that fall\noutside what Walzer terms the \u201cminimal and universal moral\ncode\u201d (Walzer 1987, 24; Walzer 1994). This gray area of debate\nincludes criminal law, family law, women\u2019s rights, social and\neconomic rights, the rights of indigenous peoples, and the attempt to\nuniversalize Western-style democratic practices. The question is: how\ncan the current thin list of universal human rights be expanded to\ninclude some of these contested rights?\n\nCharles Taylor has put forward the following proposal (Taylor 1999).\nHe imagines a cross-cultural dialogue between representatives of\ndifferent traditions. Rather than argue for the universal validity of\ntheir views, however, he suggests that participants should allow for\nthe possibility that their own beliefs may be mistaken. This way,\nparticipants can learn from each others\u2019 \u201cmoral\nuniverse\u201d. There will come a point, however, when differences\ncannot be reconciled. Taylor explicitly recognizes that different\ngroups, countries, religious communities, and civilizations hold\nincompatible fundamental views on theology, metaphysics, and human\nnature. In response, Taylor argues that a \u201cgenuine, unforced\nconsensus\u201d on human rights norms is possible only if we allow\nfor disagreement on the ultimate justifications of those norms.\nInstead of defending contested foundational values when we encounter\npoints of resistance (and thus condemning the values we do not like in\nother societies), we should try to abstract from those beliefs for the\npurpose of working out an \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d (to\nborrow from Rawls\u2019s 1993 terminology) of human rights norms. As\nTaylor puts it, \u201cwe would agree on the norms while disagreeing\non why they were the right norms, and we would be content to live in\nthis consensus, undisturbed by the differences of profound underlying\nbelief\u201d (Taylor 1999, 124).\n\nWhile Taylor\u2019s proposal moves the debate on universal human\nrights forward, it still faces certain difficulties. For one thing, it\nmay not be realistic to expect that people will be willing to abstract\nfrom the values they care deeply about during the course of a global\ndialogue on human rights. Even if people agree to abstract from\nculturally specific ways of justifying and implementing norms, the\nlikely outcome is a withdrawal to a highly general, abstract realm of\nagreement that fails to resolve actual disputes over contested rights.\nFor example, participants in a cross-cultural dialogue can agree on\nthe right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment while\nradically disagreeing upon what this means in practice\u2014a\ncommitted Muslim can argue that theft can justifiably be punished by\namputation of the right\n hand,[8]\n whereas a Western liberal will want to label this an example of cruel\nand unusual punishment.\n\nAs we have seen, the debate on universalism versus particularism has\nmoved from fairly abstract methodological disputes between\nAnglo-American philosophers to relatively concrete international\npolitical disputes between philosophers, social scientists, government\nofficials, and NGO activists. The distinctive communitarian\ncontribution has been to cast doubt on universal theories grounded\nexclusively in the liberal moralities of the Western world, on the\ngrounds that cultural particularity should both make one sensitive to\nthe possibility of justifiable areas of difference between the West\nand the rest and to the need for more cross-cultural dialogue for the\npurpose of improving the current thin human rights regime. Various\ncontributions from East Asia and elsewhere have given some meat to\nthese challenges to liberal universalism. In any case, let us now turn\nto the second main area of controversy between liberals and\ncommunitarians\u2014the debate over the self that has similarly moved\nfrom philosophy to politics.\n",
