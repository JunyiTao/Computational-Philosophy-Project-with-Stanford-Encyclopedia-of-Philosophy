But\nthis cluster of views did not go long unchallenged. In early July\n1932, just nine months after relativistic cosmology became the\nconsensus during the British Association meeting, Oxford\nastrophysicist E. A. Milne published a short article in\nNature which directly attacked the current philosophical\ntenets, proposing their replacement by a new cluster of views, one as\nradical as the new science it purported to undergird.\n",
