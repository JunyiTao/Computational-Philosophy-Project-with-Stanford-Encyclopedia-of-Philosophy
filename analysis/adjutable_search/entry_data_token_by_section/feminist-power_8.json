    "main_text": "Power as Domination || Postcolonial and Decolonial Feminist Approaches\n3.6 Postcolonial and Decolonial Feminist Approaches\n\nPostcolonial and decolonial theory offer overlapping critiques of\nhistorical and contemporary practices and discourses of imperial and\ncolonial domination. Yet they also have distinct lineages, theoretical\ncommitments, and implications (for helpful discussion, see Bhambra\n2014 and Ramamurthy and Tambe 2017). Postcolonial theory rose to\nprominence in the late 20th century, in association with the\ngroundbreaking work of Edward Said (1979) and the Subaltern Studies\nCollective, and has been most influential in literary and cultural\nstudies. Taking as its primary point of reference the northern\nEuropean colonization of Southeast Asia and focusing primarily on the\ndiscursive and cultural effects of colonialism, postcolonial theory is\ndeeply (though not uncritically) influenced by poststruturalism,\nparticularly the work of Foucault and Jacques Derrida. Decolonial\ntheory emerged somewhat later, in the early 2000s, in association with\nthe Latin American and Carribean scholars in the Modernity/Coloniality\ngroup. Its primary point of reference is the colonization of the\nAmericas that began in 1492. Heavily influenced by Latin American\nMarxism, world systems theory, and indigenous political struggles,\ndecolonial theory focuses on the connections between capitalism,\ncolonialism, and racial hierarchies. Although these two approaches are\nnot mutually exclusive, decolonial theory is often viewed as the more\nradical of the two, due to its broader historical range and its calls\nfor epistemic decolonization and delinking from capitalist\nmodernity/coloniality (Ru\u00edz 2021).\n\nGayatri Spivak's \u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d (1988) is\nwidely viewed as the watershed text in postcolonial feminism. Spivak's\nessay opens with a critical discussion of an exchange betweeen\nFoucault and Gilles Deleuze, in which they reject the idea of speaking\nfor the oppressed, insisting instead that the oppressed should speak\nfor themselves. The first part of her essay is devoted to a critique\nof this claim and of the myriad ways in which Foucault and Deleuze\nignore the epistemic violence of imperialism. It is Foucault and\nDeleuze\u2019s insistence that the oppressed \u201ccan speak and\nknow their conditions\u201d that leads Spivak to formulate her famous\nquestion, \u201ccan the subaltern speak?\u201d (78). If, as Spivak\ngoes on to suggest, the subaltern can not speak, then the\n\u201csubaltern as female is even more deeply in shadow\u201d (83).\nDrawing on the example of the British banning the practice of sati in\ncolonial India, Spivak suggests that the subaltern cannot speak\nbecause she is caught between imperialist discourse and patriarchal\ntraditionalism, neither of which enables her to voice her experience:\n\u201cBetween patriarchy and imperialism, subject-constitution and\nobject-formation, the figure of the woman disappears, not into a\npristine nothingness, but into a violent shuttling which is the\ndisplaced figuration of the \u2018third world woman\u2019 caught\nbetween tradition and modernization\u201d (102). In other words,\nthere is no space from which the subaltern as female can speak and no\nway she can be heard or read.\n\nAnother emblematic text in postcolonial feminism is Chandra Talpade\nMohanty's \u201cUnder Western Eyes\u201d (1988). Mohanty's essay is\nframed as a critique of Western feminist analyses of \u201cThird\nWorld Women\u201d for their reductive and overly simplistic\nunderstandings of power and oppression. In such discourses, as Mohanty\nexplains, \u201cpower is automatically defined in binary terms:\npeople who have it (read: men) and people who do not (read: women).\nMen exploit, women are exploited. Such simplistic formulations are\nhistorically reductive; they are also ineffectual in designing\nstrategies to combat oppressions\u201d (73). By contrast, Mohanty\ncalls for an intersectional understanding of power that refuses to\nhomogenize or falsely universalize women's experience:\n\u201cthe\u2026homogenization of class, race, religion, and daily\nmaterial practices of women in the Third World can create a false\nsense of the commonality of oppressions, interests, and struggles\nbetween and among women globally. Beyond sisterhood there are still\nracism, colonialism, and imperialism\u201d (77). Furthermore, by\nrepresenting \u201cThird World Women\u201d as mere passive objects\nor victims of oppression, Western feminists implicitly position\nthemselves as active subjects of resistance and revolutionary agents\n\u2013 which Mohanty calls \u201cthe colonialist move\u201d\n(79).\n\nMuch of the agenda for decolonial feminism was set by Lugones in a\npair of essays published in Hypatia (2007 and 2010). Building\non the work of Anibal Quijano (2000), who argued that racialization is\nrooted in the structure of colonial capitalism, Lugones contends that\ngender itself is \u201ca colonial concept and mode of organization of\nrelations of production, property relations, of cosmologies and ways\nof knowing\u201d (2007, 186). Seeing gender as a colonial concept\nenables feminists to break out of the ahistorical framework of\npatriarchy. As she explains: \u201cTo understand the relation of the\nbirth of the colonial/modern gender system to the birth of global\ncolonial capitalism\u2013with the centrality of the coloniality of\npower to that system of global power\u2013is to understand our\npresent organization of life anew\u201d (2007, 187). Lugones's\ndecolonial feminist framework combines the insights of\nintersectionality theory with Quijano\u2019s understanding of the\ncoloniality of power (2007, 187\u201388). This brings into focus what\nLugones calls the \u201cmodern/colonial gender system\u201d (2007,\n189), a system that is characterized by strict sexual dimorphism and\npresumed correspondence between biological sex and gender. In the\nlater essay, Lugones simplifies her formulation somewhat: \u201cI\ncall the analysis of racialized, capitalist, gender oppression\n\u201dthe coloniality of gender.\u201c I call the possibility of\novercoming the coloniality of gender \u201ddecolonial\nfeminism\u201c\u201d (2010, 747).\n",
