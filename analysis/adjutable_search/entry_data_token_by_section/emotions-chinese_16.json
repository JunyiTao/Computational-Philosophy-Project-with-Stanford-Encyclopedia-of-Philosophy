    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Analects\n5.1 The Analects\n\nIn many passages of the Analects, Confucius (551\u2013479\nBCE) states that true virtue comes out of a genuine affective state of\nthe mind. He emphasizes that carefully focused affective state is an\nessential component of Confucian virtue. Although Confucius does not\nmake any explicit connection between qing and emotions, his\ngeneral approach to emotions and virtue through the genuineness or\nsincerity of the mind makes an implicit connection between\nqing and emotions in the cultivation of virtue: virtue should\nreflect the affective genuineness that emerges from the essence\n(qing) of humanity. From this moral-psychological viewpoint,\none can understand how qing comes to include subjective\nfeelings and emotions and, at the same time, still refers to the\nessential human nature in early Confucian philosophy.\n\nFeelings and emotions are discussed in many passages of the\nAnalects. Confucius believes that having appropriate\nemotional states is essential in cultivating and perfecting ideal\nvirtues. True filial piety, according to him, is not just one\u2019s\nbehavior of supporting one\u2019s parents but sincere respect and\ncare for them (Analects, 2.7). What distinguishes true filial\npiety from a mere act of fulfilling one\u2019s duty to serve\none\u2019s parents is this inner state of sincere love for\none\u2019s parents. When Fanzi asked about ren (benevolence,\nthe central virtue of Confucianism), Confucius answered that\nren is to love others (Analects, 12.22). When Lin\nFang asked about ritual propriety, Confucius states that \n\n\nIn the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow\nthan a minute attention to observances. (Analects, 3.4; Legge\n1960a: 156) \n\n\nHe stresses an appropriate state of the mind, i.e., deep sorrow and\nsincere sadness, not the formal details of the ceremony in ritual\npropriety. At the foundation of Confucian virtues such as filial piety\n(xiao \u5b5d), benevolence (ren \u4ec1), and ritual\npropriety (li \uf9b6), one can always see genuine and\nappropriate emotional states with the fully dedicated mind.\n\nA diverse group of emotions such as le (\u6a02\njoy), ai (\u54c0 sorrow), hao (\u597d liking),\nand you (\u6182 worry) are discussed in\nthe Analects. Confucius always sees, underneath the\nobservable actions and behaviors, deep emotional flow as a critical\nelement of humaneness and moral excellence.\n\n\nThe Master said, \u201cHigh station filled without indulgent\ngenerosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted\nwithout sorrow (ai \u54c0 sorrow)\u2014wherewith should I\ncontemplate such ways?\u201d (Analects, 3.26; Legge 1960a:\n164)\n\nThe Master said, \u201cThey who know [zhi \u77e5] the truth are\nnot equal to those who love [hao \u597d liking] it, and they who\nlove it are not equal to those who delight [le \u6a02 joy] in\nit\u201d. (Analects, 6.20; Legge 1960a: 191)\n\n\nConfucius not only explains virtues through emotional states but also\nexpresses the excitement of cultivating and perfecting virtues through\nlearning (xue \u5b78). The beginning chapter of the\nAnalects starts with Confucius\u2019s excitement of\nlearning: \n\n\nIs it not pleasant [le \u6a02] to learn with a constant\nperseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends\ncoming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who\nfeels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?\n(Analects, 1.1; Legge 1960a: 137) \n\n\nThe excitement and delight in this passage are not simple hedonic\nstates of the mind but a fully engaged sense of one\u2019s virtuous\nmind. Confucius also expresses his sadness when his beloved disciple\nYan Yuan died. Confucius \n\n\nbewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said,\n\u201cMaster, your grief is excessive!\u201d \u201cIs it\nexcessive?\u201d said he. \u201cIf I am not to mourn bitterly for\nthis man, for whom should I mourn?\u201d (Analects, 11.10;\nLegge 1960a: 240). \n\n\nHe does not hide his naturally aroused emotions as expressions of his\ngenuine heart-mind. In the Analects, therefore, Confucius\nshows that emotions and feelings are essential components of virtue\nand self-cultivation, and highlights the affective nature of the moral\nmind.\n\nNone of these emotions and feelings, however, are explicitly linked to\nqing in the Analects. Qing appears twice in\nthe Analects, in the contexts where it means genuineness,\ntruthfulness, situations or circumstances. For example, there is no\ndirect connection between qing and emotions in the following\npassages of the Analects. \n\n\nIf he [a superior person] love good faith, the people will not dare\nnot to be sincere [qing, truthful]. (Analects, 13.4;\nLegge 1960a: 265)\n\nThe rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently\nhave been disorganized, for a long time. When you have found out the\ntruth [qing, situation] of any accusation, be grieved for and\npity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\n(Analects, 19.19; Legge 1960a: 345)\n\n\nIn these passages, qing means genuineness, truthfulness and\nobjective reality. It seems that when Confucius\u2019s teachings were\nrecorded around 500 BCE, qing had little relation to\nsubjective inner feelings even though Confucius discussed emotions and\nfeelings in the Analects. As Graham (1990) and Hansen (1995)\nargue, qing gets associated with emotions and feelings in the\nlater stages of Chinese philosophy. This does not mean that emotions\nare not important or not discussed in Chinese philosophy in the\nWarring States period. In fact, the Analects is filled with\nConfucius\u2019s teachings on emotions and feelings. Le (\u6a02\njoy) appears 23 times in the Analects when filial piety\n(xiao \u5b5d) and righteousness (yi \u7fa9) show up 14 and\n20 times respectively.\n",
