    "main_text": "The Affects || The Affects and Striving\n2.1 The Affects and Striving\n\n\nThe human affects, for Spinoza, are a part of nature insofar as each\ncan be redescribed in terms of striving, a property which all\nparticular things in nature share. Desire and its varieties are\nstriving itself, under a certain description. Human passions are for\nSpinoza changes, that is, increases or decreases, in the power with\nwhich we, or parts of us, strive. Active affects are all increases in\nthe power with which we strive.\n\n\nSpinoza introduces the first of his primary affects, desire, at\nIIIp9s, directly after introducing the doctrine of human striving,\nwhich, in its most general form, he calls appetite.\nIII Proposition 9, Scholium: \u2026Between appetite and\ndesire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related\nto men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be\ndefined as appetite together with consciousness of the\nappetite.\n\n\nThus Spinoza identifies human desire with human essence and especially\nwith consciousness of one\u2019s essence, the striving for perseverance in\nbeing. Spinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness is notoriously difficult, and\nit is not clear which ideas in a human mind are conscious or the\nextent to which things other than human beings have consciousness. For\nhuman beings, at least, however, what seems to us to cause us to act,\nour desire, does, on Spinoza\u2019s view, do just that. If I am asked for\nthe proximate cause of my action in picking up my coffee cup, for\nexample, I will respond that it was my desire for the coffee. In\nidentifying the cause of human action, striving, with conscious\ndesire, then, IIIp9s vindicates common sense to a degree. Had Spinoza\nidentified desire with something other than striving, then he would\nhave committed himself to the view that my desire does not in fact\ncause me to pick up the cup. (Desire for Spinoza, in its narrow\ndefinition at IIIp9s, is both psychological and physical, and in its\nbroader definition at III, Definitions of the Affects I, it may be\neither. This example therefore, perhaps despite appearances, need not run\nafoul of Spinoza\u2019s denial of mind-body interaction.)\n\n\nIIIp9s, then, goes a long way toward showing how the universal\nstriving doctrine can be the basis for an account of human desire. A\nserious problem remains, however. Although we tend to see desire as\nthe proximate cause of action, we tend also to conceive of desire as\ninvolving teleology or final causes. If desire causes me to pick up\nthe cup, how does it do so? The common-sense answer is\nteleological: I have, as an end, coffee, and I am, in a sense, drawn\ntoward it.  Spinoza is well-aware of the fact that we commonly\nsuppose that there are teleological causes of our actions, and some accounts of appetite in the Ethics, notably IVd7, seem to incorporate teleological notions. However, Spinoza also explicitly denies that appetite is anything other than an efficient cause.  This passage is from Part IV\u2019s Preface:\nWhat is called a final cause is nothing but a human\nappetite insofar as it is considered as a principle, or primary cause,\nof some thing. For example, when we say that habitation was the final\ncause of this or that house, surely we understand nothing but that a\nman, because he imagined the conveniences of domestic life, had an\nappetite to build a house. So habitation, insofar as it is considered\nas a final cause, is nothing more than this singular appetite. It is\nreally an efficient cause, which is considered as a first cause,\nbecause men are commonly ignorant of the causes of their\nappetites.\n\n\nSpinoza does not clearly deny, here, that there are teleological causes of\naction. (For arguments against the view that Spinoza denies all\nteleology, see Garrett 1999 and Lin 2006. Carriero 2005 is an influential argument that Spinoza does deny all teleology.)  He does, however, identify such causes\nwith efficient causes.  He needs to show, then, how the ends of human\naction relate to the processes of efficient causation.  \n\n\nFor this task, Spinoza introduces the other primary affects and a\nnumber of psychological laws associated with them. He introduces the\nprimary passions at IIIp11s.\nIII Proposition 11, Scholium: We see, then, that the mind\ncan undergo great changes, and pass now to a greater, now to a lesser\nperfection. These passions, indeed, explain to us the affects of Joy\n[laetitia] and Sadness [tristitia]. By Joy,\ntherefore, I shall understand in what follows that passion by which the\nmind passes to a greater perfection. And by Sadness, that passion by\nwhich it passes to a lesser perfection.\n\n\nThe perfectionist language Spinoza uses is important for an\nunderstanding of the basis for ethics that he finds in psychology.\nHere, however, it may be understood in terms of striving. An increased\npower to persevere in being is for Spinoza a transition to greater\nperfection and a decreased power is a transition to lesser perfection\n(see IIIp11, the end of IV Preface, and especially III, Definitions of\nthe Affects, III, Exp.). So, although this generalization is\ncomplicated by Spinoza\u2019s definitions that refer passions either to\nparts of the body or to the body as whole, joy is the passion one\nexperiences in the transition to an increased power to strive, and\nsadness is the passion one experiences in the opposite\ntransition. Spinoza thus provides, in his account of the affects, the\nbasis for an explanation of how it is that introspection into our\nconscious experience of desire might fail to bring us accurate\nknowledge of our own psychological processes. Our conscious\nexperience in forming our desires, has an emotional component: we experience\njoy and sadness and varieties of these. But we may be unaware of why\nwe feel joy or sadness or why, really, we desire what we desire. So\nSpinoza writes repeatedly, in the context of his criticisms of\nteleological reasoning and the introspective experiences of free will\nor mind/body causation (e.g., at IIIp2s): \u201cmen are conscious of their\nactions and ignorant of the causes by which they are determined.\u201d\n\n\nSpinoza characterizes the apparent teleology in desire at IIIp28:\nWe strive to promote the occurrence of whatever we imagine\nwill lead to joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary\nto it, or will lead to sadness.\n\n\nSpinoza reserves the term \u2018imagine\u2019 [imaginor]\nfor the description of conscious states, so IIIp28 describes, at least\nin part, the objects of desire. If I imagine that coffee will lead to\njoy, then I will desire that joy and so that coffee. IIIp28, strictly\nspeaking, is not an exhaustive characterization of objects of desire.\nIt implies only that we desire anything which we imagine will lead to\njoy and are averse to whatever we imagine will lead to sadness and not\nthat we might not have other kinds of desires also, desires unrelated\nto either joy or sadness. A review of the particular forms of desire\nSpinoza catalogues in Part III (see, notably, IIIp27c3s, IIIp29s,\nIIIp40c2s,IIIp41, and IIIp56s) suggests, however, that the view is\nstill stronger than the limited claim of IIIp28: it seems that Spinoza\ndoes hold that anything I desire will be a thing which I imagine will\nlead to joy and that anything I am averse to will be something which I\nimagine will lead to sadness.\n\n\nWhat may seem on introspection, then, to be a wholly teleological\ncause of action, the end represented by an object of desire, is for\nSpinoza a peculiar manifestation in consciousness of striving, which\nin turn is an efficient cause of action. I reach for the cup of\ncoffee, I may think, just because the joy that I anticipate in the\ncoffee \u201cpulls\u201d me to it; in fact, however, I reach for the coffee\nbecause my characteristic striving (perhaps as a partial cause in\ncombination with other partial causes such as the memory of past\ncups\u2014IIIp36) has that effect. It \u201cpushes\u201d me toward the cup.\n",
