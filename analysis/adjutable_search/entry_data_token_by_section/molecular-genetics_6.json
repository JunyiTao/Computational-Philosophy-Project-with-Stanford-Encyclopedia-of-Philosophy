    "main_text": "Was classical genetics reduced to molecular genetics? || The Anti-reductionist consensus about genetics\n3.2  The Anti-reductionist consensus about genetics\n\n\nMost philosophers writing on genetics and reductionism have argued\nthat molecular genetics has not and will not reduce classical genetics\n(e.g., see Wimsatt  1976a, Darden and Maull 1977, Kitcher 1984,\nRosenberg 1985 and 1994, Dupr\u00e9 1993, and Burian 1996). Two\nobjections to Schaffner's reductionist thesis have been most\npersuasive: the unconnectability objection and the gory details\nobjection. The unconnectability objection claims that the\nterminology of classical genetics cannot be redefined at the molecular\nlevel in terms of DNA. This objection effectively claims that\nNagel's second formal requirement, the connectability\nrequirement, cannot be satisfied. The gory details\nobjection alleges that molecular genetics cannot and will not\nexplain classical genetics or better explain the phenomena that are\nalready explained by the classical theory. This objection relates to\nNagel's first formal requirement, the derivability\nrequirement. But the gory details objection goes philosophically\ndeeper because it implies that even if the explanatory principles of\nclassical genetics could be derived from the explanatory principles of\nmolecular genetics, the derivations would not be explanatory. \n\n\nThe most rigorous formulation of the unconnectability objection can be\nfound in the early writings of Rosenberg who once contended that there\nis an unbridgeable conceptual gap between the classical and molecular\ntheories of genetics (1985, 1994). In support of this contention,\nRosenberg argued that relations between the gene concept of classical\ngenetics and the concepts of molecular genetics are hopelessly\ncomplicated \u201cmany-many\u201d relations that will forever\nfrustrate any attempt to systematically connect the two theories.\nRosenberg began his analysis by pointing out that in classical\ngenetics, genes are identified by way of their phenotypic effects.\nClassical geneticists identified the gene for purple eye-color, for\nexample, by carrying out carefully orchestrated breeding experiments\nand following the distribution of eye-color phenotypes in successive\ngenerations of a laboratory population. The reason classical genetics\nwill never be reduced to a molecular-level science, according to\nRosenberg (1985), is that there is no manageable connection between\nthe concept of a Mendelian phenotype and that of a molecular gene:\n\n\n\nThe pathway to red eye pigment production begins at many distinct\nmolecular genes and proceeds through several alternative branched\npathways. \u2026 The pathway from the [molecular] genes also\ncontains redundant, ambiguous, and interdependent paths. If we give a\nbiochemical characterization of the gene for red eye color either by\nappeal to the parts of its pathway of synthesis, or by appeal to the\nsegments of DNA that it begins with, our molecular description of this\ngene will be too intricate to be of any practical explanatory\nupshot. (Rosenberg 1985, p. 101)\n\n\n\nRosenberg concluded that since the relation between molecular genes\nand Mendelian phenotypes is exceedingly complex, the connection\nbetween any molecular concept and the Mendelian gene concept must also\nbe exceedingly complex, thereby blocking any systematic, reductive\nexplanation of classical genetics in terms of molecular-level\ntheory.\n\n\nThe gory details objection can be traced back to the writings of\nPutnam (1965) and Fodor (1968) who argued against reductionism of the\nmental on the basis that psychological functons are\nmultiply-realized. This objection against reductionism was further\ndeveloped in the context of genetics, most thoroughly by Kitcher\n(e.g., see Kitcher 1984, 1999, 2001).  Following Hull, Kitcher assumes\nthat classical genetics is transmission genetics. The classical\ntheory, according to Kitcher, explains the transmission of phenotypic\ntraits, not the development of phenotypic traits in individual\norganisms. And transmission phenomena, on Kitcher's account, are best\nexplained at the level of cytology: \u201cThe distribution of genes\nto gametes is to be explained, not by rehearsing the gory details of\nthe reshuffling of the molecules, but through the observation that\nchromosomes are aligned in pairs just prior to the meiotic division,\nand that one chromosome from each matched pair is transmitted to each\ngamete.\u201d (Kitcher 1984, p. 370). Kitcher suggests that the\npairing and separation of chromosomes belong to a natural kind of pair\nseparation processes which are heterogeneous from the molecular\nperspective because different kinds of forces are responsible for\nbringing together and pulling apart different paired entities. The\nseparation of paired entities, he claims, \u201cmay occur because of\nthe action of electromagnetic forces or even nuclear forces; but it is\neasy to think of examples in which the separation is effected by the\naction of gravity.\u201d (Kitcher 1984, p. 350)\n\n\nThe image of genetics that emerges from the anti-reductionist\nliterature is of a two-tiered science composed of two discreet\ntheoretical discourses, one grounded in principles about entities at\nthe cytological level (such as chromosomes) and the other grounded in\nprinciples about entities at the molecular level (such as nucleotide\nsequences in DNA). Anti-reductionists believe some phenomena,\nincluding transmission of genes, are best explained by a theory\ngrounded at the cytological level and other phenomena, including the\nexpression of genes, are best explained by a theory grounded at the\nmolecular level. Although Kitcher argues that classical genetics\nprovides the best explanation in an objective sense, some\nanti-reductionists (e.g., Rosenberg 1985, 1994) believe that the\nobstacles to reduction are merely practical. Rosenberg (1985,\n1994) appealed to the concept of supervenience to argue that in\nprinciple, molecular genetics would provide the best\nexplanations. But he argued that in practice, classical\ngenetics provides the \u201cbest\u201d explanation of transmission\nphenomena, in the sense that this is the best explanation available to\ncreatures with our cognitive limitations. Subsequently, however,\nRosenberg changed his position on this issue, largely on the grounds\nthat that technological advances in information storage and processing\n\"may substantially enhance our capacity to understand macromolecular\nprocesses and their combinations\" (Rosenberg 2006, p. 14).\n\n\nDespite philosophically significant differences in their views about\nthe ultimate basis of the irreducibility of classical genetics, the\nimage of biological knowledge that emerges from the\nantireductionists' writings is similar. The biological world\nconsists of different domains of phenomena and each domain is best\nexplained at a particular level of theoretical discourse. Hence, the\nideal structure for biology is akin to a layer-cake, with tiers of\ntheories, each of which provides the best possible account of its\ndomain of phenomena. Biological sciences such as classical genetics\nthat are couched in terms of higher levels of organization should\npersist, secure from the reductive grasp of molecular science, because\ntheir central theories (or patterns of reasoning) explain domains of\nphenomena that are best explained at levels higher than the molecular\nlevel. \n",
