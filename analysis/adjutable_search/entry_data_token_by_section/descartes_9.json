    "main_text": "A New Metaphysics and Epistemology || The nature of reality\n3.3 The nature of reality\n\nDescartes reveals his ontology implicitly in the six Meditations, more\nformally in the Replies to Objections, and in textbook fashion in the\nPrinciples (esp. I.51\u201365). The main metaphysical\nresults that describe the nature of reality assert the existence of\nthree substances, each characterized by an essence. The first and\nprimary substance is God, whose essence is supreme perfection (Med.\n7:46. 52. 54. 162; Princ. I.54). In fact, God is the only\ngenuine substance, that is, the only being that is capable of existing\non its own. The other two substances, mind and matter, are created by\nGod and can only exist through his ongoing act of preservation or\nconservation, called God\u2019s \u201cconcurrence\u201d\n(Princ. I.51).\n\nDescartes\u2019 arguments to establish the essences of these\nsubstances appeal directly to his clear and distinct perception of\nthose essences. God is an infinite substance and the idea of God\nincludes necessary existence (Med. III, V, Princ.\nI.14, 19). Descartes used this idea of God to fashion an argument for\nthe existence of God, now called the Ontological Argument (see Nolan\n2021).\n\nThe essence of matter is extension in length, breadth, and depth. One\nmight speak here of \u201cspatial extension,\u201d but with this\nproviso: that Descartes denied the existence of space separate from\nmatter. Cartesian matter does not fill a distinct spatial container;\nrather, spatial extension is constituted by extended matter (there is\nno void, or unfilled space). This extended substance possesses the\nfurther \u201cmodes\u201d of size, shape, position, and motion.\nModes are properties that exist only as modifications of the essential\nor principal attributes of a substance. In addition to its essence,\nextension, matter also has the general attributes of existence and\ntemporal duration (these are shared with mind).\n\nThe essence of mind is thought. Minds have the principal attribute of\nthinking, divided into the two chief powers or faculties previously\nmentioned: intellect and will. The intellectual, or perceiving power\nis further divided into the modes of pure intellect, imagination, and\nsense perception. As mentioned in Section 3.3, pure intellect operates\nindependently of the brain or body, while imagination and sense\nperception require the body for their operation. The will is also\ndivided into various modes, including desire, aversion, assertion,\ndenial, and doubt. These always require some intellectual content\n(whether pure, imagined, or sensory) upon which to operate. Perhaps\nfor that reason, Descartes describes the mind as an\n\u201cintellectual substance\u201d (Med. VI, 7:78; also,\n7:12). The mind essentially has a will, but the intellectual (or\nperceptive, or representational) power is more basic, as the\noperations of the will depend on it.\n\nWhat role does consciousness play in Descartes\u2019 theory of mind?\nMany scholars believe that, for Descartes, consciousness is the\ndefining property of mind (e.g., Rozemond 2006). There is some support\nfor this position in the Meditations (Second Replies).\nDescartes defines mind as \u201cthe substance in which thought\nimmediately resides\u201d (7:161), and he says that the term\n\u201cthought\u201d extends to \u201ceverything that is within us\nin such a way that we are immediately conscious of it\u201d (7:160*).\nIf mind is thinking substance and thoughts are essentially conscious,\nperhaps consciousness is the essence of thought?\n\nPerhaps not. Descartes did hold that all thoughts are, in some way,\nconscious (7:226), but this did not mean that we have reflective\nawareness of, or notice, every thought that we have (Corr.\n5:220). In the Second Meditation, he describes himself as a thinking\nthing by enumerating all the modes of thoughts of which he is\nconscious: understanding (or intellection), willing, imagining, and\n(at this point, at least seeming to have) sense perceptions (7:28). He\nthus sets up consciousness as a mark of thought. But is it the\nessence? Not necessarily. If perception (intellection, representation)\nis the essence of thought, then all thoughts might have basic\nconsciousness because the character of the intellectual substance is\nto represent, and any representation present in an intellectual\nsubstance is, thereby, present in mind. An intellectual substance (a\nmind) is a perceiving substance, which intrinsically perceives its own\nstates. Further, he held that any act of will present in an\nintellectual substance is thereby available to consciousness\n(Pass. I.19). (On consciousness and the essence of mind, see\nJorgensen 2020, 2.1).\n\nIn distinguishing between conscious thoughts and thoughts of which we\nare reflectively aware, Descartes allowed for conscious thoughts that\nwe don\u2019t notice or remember. Indeed, his theory of the senses\n(Sec. 5) allows for unnoticed sensations and mental operations.\n",
