    "preamble": "\n\n\nPerhaps the most influential Parisian philosopher of the fourteenth\ncentury, John Buridan did much to shape the way philosophy was done\nnot only during his own lifetime, but throughout the later scholastic\nand early modern periods.  He spent his entire career as a teaching\nmaster in the arts faculty at the University of Paris, lecturing on\nlogic and the works of Aristotle, and producing many commentaries and\nindependent treatises on logic, metaphysics, natural philosophy, and\nethics. His most famous work is the Summulae de dialectica\n(Compendium of Dialectic), a text of astonishing breadth and\noriginality aimed at redeeming the older tradition of Aristotelian\nlogic using the newer, terminist logic of \u2018moderns\u2019 such\nas Peter of Spain and William of Ockham.  Buridan applied these\nanalytical techniques so successfully in his metaphysics, natural\nphilosophy, and ethics that, for many of his successors, they came to be\nidentified with the method of philosophy, understood as\na secular practice, i.e., as distinct from theology.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\n\nJohn Buridan was born sometime before 1300 at or near the town of\nB\u00e9thune in Picardy, France. He was educated in Paris, first at\nthe Coll\u00e8ge Lemoine, where he was awarded a benefice or stipend\nfor needy students, and then at the University of Paris, where he\nreceived his Master of Arts degree and formal license to teach by the\nmid-1320s. He enjoyed a long and illustrious career as an arts master\nat Paris, serving twice (in 1328 and 1340) as university rector and\nsupporting himself with numerous benefices. He last appears alive and\nwell in a document of 1358, which mentions him adjudicating a\nterritorial dispute between the English and Picard nations (the\nParisian student body at the time was organized according to one's\nplace of origin). He must have died shortly thereafter because in 1361,\none of his benefices was awarded to another\n person.[1]\n\n\nSuch is the historical record\u2014a handful of relatively minor\n details.[2]\n Buridan's fame as a teacher and philosopher,\nhowever, quickly turned his life into the stuff of legend. There are\nstories that he met his end when the King of France had him thrown into\nthe Seine River in a sack because of a scandalous affair with the\nQueen, that he went on to found the University of Vienna after being\nexpelled from Paris for his nominalist teachings, and that he even hit\nthe future Pope Clement VI over the head with a shoe while competing\nfor the affections of the wife of a German shoemaker (the blow\napparently created the prodigious memory for which Clement was widely\nknown). But none of these stories can be independently verified, and\nmost are inconsistent with what we do know about\n him.[3]\n Nevertheless, they illustrate what the French scholar Edmond Faral\ncalled the \u201cbruits de ville\u201d or \u2018buzz\u2019\nsurrounding Buridan's name in Parisian circles, which continued for\nsome time after his death (Faral 1950, 16).\n\n\nBuridan's academic career was unusual in two respects, both of which\nhelp to explain his philosophical outlook. First, he appears to have\nspent his entire career in the faculty of arts, without moving on to\nstudy for a doctoral degree in one of the more prestigious faculties\nof law, medicine, or theology, which was the more typical career path of a\nmedieval academic. Most of the figures we think of today as medieval\nphilosophers were in fact trained as theologians, including Thomas\nAquinas, Duns Scotus, and even William of Ockham (though he did not\nfinish his degree). Since university statutes forbade arts masters\nfrom teaching or writing about theology, Buridan produced no\ntheological works and no commentary on the Sentences of Peter\nLombard, the principal genre of philosophical writing in the\nfourteenth century.\n Why did Buridan remain in the faculty of arts? It is unlikely that\nsomeone of his obvious philosophical ability would have gone\nunnoticed. Nor does the reason appear to have been a lack of means,\nfor despite his impoverished background he did receive a number of\nbursaries and stipends, and is even listed in a document of 1349 as\nbeing among those masters capable of supporting themselves without\nfinancial assistance from the University. One possible\nanswer\u2014though in the absence of concrete evidence that he never\nstudied theology, it must remain speculative\u2014is that he\ndeliberately chose to remain among the \u2018artists\n[artistae]\u2019. What little he does say about philosophy\nvery clearly ties the philosophical enterprise to his office as an\narts master, not to whatever it was theologians took themselves to be\ndoing.  Rejecting the traditional picture of theological learning as\nthe perfection or completion of philosophical wisdom, Buridan seems to\narticulate, sometimes in spite of himself, a new vision of philosophy\nas a secular enterprise based on what is evident to the senses and\nintellect, in contrast to theology, which begins from non-evident\ntruths revealed in scripture and\ndoctrine.[4]\nPerhaps most tellingly, Buridan never refers to theology as\nconstituting a \u2018scientia\u2019, or body of\nknowledge\u2014an assumption almost all theologians took great pains\nto defend in their commentaries on the \nSentences.[5]\n\n\nBuridan is also different in that he remained for his entire life a\nsecular cleric rather than joining a religious order such as the\nDominicans or Franciscans. A papal letter of 1329 refers to him as\nsimply, \u201cclericus Atrebatensis diocoesis, magister in\nartibus [a cleric from the Diocese of Arras and Master of\n Arts]\u201d (Faral 1950, 11).\n By contrast, the best-known names of the period all had religious\nand intellectual affiliations beyond the university: Thomas Aquinas\n(Dominican), Duns Scotus (Franciscan), William of Ockham (Franciscan),\nGregory of Rimini (Augustinian), to name a few. The benefit for\nBuridan was that it freed him from the obligation to enter into the\ndoctrinal disputes that had begun to arise, with alarming frequency\nand intensity, between religious orders, or between an order and the\nchurch hierarchy\u2014e.g., the dispute between the papacy and the\nFranciscans over apostolic poverty. Thus, whereas Ockham spent his\nentire later career on political crusades, away from philosophy, and\nwas finally excommunicated for his troubles, Buridan was bound only by\nthe intellectual and pedagogical traditions of his university. His\nconfessional independence also meant that he could help himself to\nphilosophical insights from a variety of sources. This occasionally emerges in the\neclectic character of his work, as we shall see below.\n2. Writings\n\n\nMost of Buridan's works are in the form of commentaries on\nAristotle. He wrote both expositiones (expositions), or\nliteral commentaries consisting of detailed, line-by-line explanations\nof the meaning of Aristotle's words, and quaestiones\n(questions), or longer, critical studies of the philosophical issues\nraised by them, usually centered on a specific lemma from the text.\nBoth genres originated in the classroom, a fact which becomes clear in\noccasional references to student queries and student concerns which survive in\nthe written versions. Like teachers in our own day, Buridan\nlectured more than once on the same text over the course of his career,\nwith the result that there are sometimes different versions of his\ncommentary on the same work. For example, there are three versions of\nhis Quaestiones on Aristotle's De anima, the last of\nwhich identifies itself as the \u201cthird or final lecture\n[tertia sive ultima lectura]\u201d. Where there are multiple\nversions of the same commentary, their relationship is generally one\nof increasing length and sophistication over time.\n\n\nBuridan commented on virtually all of the major works of Aristotle.\nIn addition to the entire Organon, there are commentaries on\nAristotle's Physics, On the Heavens, On\nGeneration and Corruption, De Anima, Parva\nNaturalia, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, and\n Rhetoric.[6]\n He also wrote a number of shorter, independent treatises on\nphilosophical topics that were controversial in his day, such as the Tractatus de\nrelationibus [Treatise on Relations], Tractatus de\nuniversalibus [Treatise on Universals], Tractatus de\nconsequentiis [Treatise on Consequences], and Quaestio de\npuncto [Question on <the Nature of> Points].  He was a very prolific author.\n\n\nBut Buridan's masterwork is the Summulae de dialectica\n[Compendium of Dialectic], a comprehensive logic textbook which started\nout as a commentary on the Summulae logicales or logical\ncompendium of the thirteenth-century dialectician, Peter of\n Spain,[7]\n but soon evolved into an independent work of astonishing breadth and\noriginality. In it, Buridan redeems the older medieval tradition of\nAristotelian logic through the via moderna [modern\nway]\u2014i.e., the newer, terminist logic that had gradually\nreplaced it. Because the work was accessible to master and student\nalike, it became extremely popular at Paris and in newly-founded\nuniversities such as Heidelberg, Prague, and Vienna.\n\n\nBuridan's other works were almost as widely read as the\nSummulae. Handwritten copies and early printed editions were\ncarried by his students and followers throughout Europe, where they\nwere often used as primary texts in university courses on logic and\nAristotelian philosophy, meaning that arts masters would teach\nAristotle by reading and explaining Buridan's commentary to the class.\nAs a result, the via Buridani continued to shape European\nthought well into the Renaissance.\n\n\nLike other medieval philosophers, Buridan's thought has not been fully\nappreciated because of the lack of modern editions and translations of\nhis work (see bibliography). But the situation\nbegan to improve with the appearance in 2001 of Gyula Klima's mammoth\ntranslation of the entire Summulae from the (now complete)\nLatin critical edition of this text. More recently, an edition of\nBuridan's commentary On Generation and Corruption has\nappeared (Streijger, Bakker, & Thijssen 2010), along with editions\nof the first four books of his commentary on the Physics\n(ed. Streijger & Bakker, 2015, 2016), as well as of his very\ninteresting commentary on pseudo-Albertus-Magnus' treatise De\nsecretis mulierum [On the Secrets of Women] (ed. Beneduce 2017).\nWe also now have a reliable English translation of his groundbreaking\nTreatise on Consequences (tr. Read 2015). An edition and\ntranslation of Buridan's influential commentary on De Anima\nis virtually complete (ed. Hartman, Sobol, & Zupko, with tr. by\nHartman, Klima, & Zupko, forthcoming in 2018).  Other editions are\nin progress, but knowledge of Latin and the ability to read medieval\nmanuscripts remain essential if one wishes to study Buridan's thought\nfirst-hand.\n3. Language\n\n\nIn the medieval university, arts masters provided students with their\nbasic education in grammar, logic or dialectic, and Aristotelian\nphilosophy, subjects that embodied the ideals of literacy and learning\nin the Middle Ages. What they taught is perhaps best understood as a\nspecialized language of rational inquiry, which became the foundation\nfor further study in the faculties of law, medicine, and\ntheology. Students were required to learn, in ascending order, the\nexposition and interpretation of authoritative texts (grammar), the\nstructure and modes of argumentative discourse (logic), and finally,\nthe systematic analysis and investigation of the order of nature\n(Aristotelian philosophy). Although he did not write grammatical\n treatises,[8]\n Buridan asserts in the very first section of the Summulae\nthat \u201cpositive grammar [grammatica positiva] has to be\nlearned first, by means of which the master is able to communicate\nwith the disciple, whether it be in Latin, French, Greek, or Hebrew,\nor whatever else\u201d (S 1.1.1: 6). The disciple's knowledge of\nlogic and Aristotelian philosophy is built upon this grammatical\nfoundation.\n\n\nThe importance of language in Buridan's philosophy emerges on many\nlevels, all of which are driven by his pedagogical aims. In logic,\ngrammatical rules are explicitly subsumed as necessary conditions of\nthe science (scientia) of logic, so that although the\nlogician's notion of truth and the grammarian's notion of congruence\nare separable in theory, in practice the complete significance of a\npiece of discourse cannot be determined without both. Context is\ncrucial to interpretation:\nWe should also note that some might ask whether it is the\ncomposite or the divided sense that is properly expressed by\n\u2018Every man or (a) donkey runs\u2019, that is to say, whether\nonly the term \u2018man\u2019 or the whole subject is distributed.\nAnd I say that we have to respond differently, in accordance with the\ndifferent manners of speaking and writing. For if immediately after\n\u2018man\u2019 there is a sign of division, namely, a pause or a\nperiod, then the proposition will be called divided, and only\n\u2018man\u2019 will be distributed, but if not, then it will be\ncalled \u2018composite\u2019, and the whole subject will be\ndistributed. (S 4.2.6: 250; cf. S 9.4, 15th sophism:\n912\u201313).\n\n\nAccordingly, logic is not about some conceptually ideal or canonical\nlanguage but the practical art of interpreting human discourse:\nan utterance [vox] does not have any proper import\n[virtus propria] in signifying and suppositing, except from\nourselves. So by an agreement of the disputing parties, as in\nobligational disputes, we can impose on it a new signification and not\nuse it according to its common signification. We can also speak\nfiguratively [transsumptive] and ironically, according to a\ndifferent signification. But we call a locution \u2018proper\u2019\nwhen we use it according to the signification commonly and principally\ngiven to it, and we call a locution \u2018improper\u2019 when we use\nit otherwise, although we can legitimately use it otherwise. So it is\nabsurd to say that a proposition of an author is false, absolutely\nspeaking, if he puts it forth incorporating an improper locution,\naccording to which it is true. Instead, we ought to say that it is\ntrue, since it is enunciated according to the sense in which it is true\n\u2026 So it absolutely seems to me that wherever it is evident that\nan author puts forward a proposition in a true sense, although not as a\nproper locution, then to deny that proposition without qualification\nwould be cantankerous and insolent [dyscolum et protervum].\nBut to avoid error, it should be properly pointed out that the\nproposition is not true in the proper sense, or by virtue of its proper\nmeaning, and then it has to be shown in which sense it is true. (S\n4.3.2: 256; cf. QIP 5: 144\u2013145, ll. 800\u2013829)\n\n\nIn Buridan's view, the logician cannot expound the meaning of a\nproposition without carefully attending to its internal features, i.e.,\nthe sense of the particular locutions incorporated in it, as well as to\nits external features, i.e., the discourse conditions that surround\nit (see Zupko 2015).\n\n\nThis willingness to take human language as it is found, with all of\nits ambiguities and rough edges, marks an important difference between\nBuridan and Ockham, the fourteenth-century philosopher with whom he is\nmost often compared. Both make the traditional assumption that\npropositions, be they spoken, written, or mental, are the bearers of\ntruth and falsity. Ockham, however, tends to see mental propositions\nas logically ideal or, in modern parlance,\n \u2018canonical\u2019.[9]\n The problem with spoken and written propositions is that because they\ndepend on the meaning conventions of fallible users, they fail to be\nuniversal and logically perspicuous.  Thankfully, these shortcomings\ncan be filtered out metalinguistically once we realize that the\nmeanings of their constituent terms depend on their corresponding\nmental concepts, which naturally signify the same for everyone. So in\nOckham's logic, the semantic relation between these concepts and what\nthey signify outside the mind is of paramount importance; spoken and\nwritten terms have semantic properties too, of course, but in an\nentirely derivative way. By contrast, Buridan never privileges\nconceptual discourse or suggests that the logician might use it\nsystematically to reform spoken or written language. He holds that\nspoken and written utterances\u2014sometimes he uses the term\n\u2018utterance [vox]\u2019 where Ockham has \u2018term\n[terminus]\u2019\u2014signify concepts primarily: \u201cthe\ncapability of speaking was given to us in order that we could signify\nour concepts to others and also the capacity of hearing was given to\nus in order that the concepts of speakers could be signified to\nus\u201d (S 4.1.2: 222). Accordingly, \u201cutterances are imposed\nto signify things only through the mediation of the concepts by which\nthose things are conceived\u201d (QC 1: 4, ll. 45\u20136). Concepts are\njust the medium of signification for Buridan, the cognitive or\npsychological aspect of the signification of a word.\n\n\nThis difference helps to explain why Buridan uses paradoxes of\nself-reference to test the functionality of his logic, whereas Ockham\navoids them by claiming that a term\u2014or at least a term in those\ncircumstances\u2014cannot refer to\n itself.[10]\n Buridan takes seriously the fact that people can and do utter\nself-referential propositions, and thinks logicians should say what is\ngoing on when they do. This is really a difference of perspective. As\nJo\u00ebl Biard has pointed out, we can divide medieval logicians into\nthose who try to restrict the possibilities of human discourse in the\ndirection of what is logically ideal, and those who are willing to\naccept a proposition because it is grammatical and because the person\nwho utters it intends to signify something by it. Ockham, William of\nSherwood, and Walter Burley belong to the former group; Buridan and\nThomas Bradwardine to the\n latter.[11]\n It also explains why Buridan tells us that it is not possible to\nanalyze contradictory propositions unless they \u201chave the same\nsubject and predicate in utterance and also in intention\u201d (S\n9.7, 2nd sophism: 943), and his reminding us that, when testing a\nproposition for contradictoriness, \u201cit is [sometimes] necessary\nto add other utterances when contradicting it\u2026. For one should\nprimarily attend to the intention, for we use words only to express\nthe intention\u201d (S 9.8, 11th sophism: 979). The logician must\nabove all be a skilled interpreter of human discourse.\n\n\nFor Buridan, linguistic confusion is the source of many of the\ntraditional problems of metaphysics and natural philosophy. His\napproach is broadly nominalistic, but Buridan's nominalism is more of\na parsimonious way of doing philosophy than a doctrine about the\nontological or metaphysical status of universals.  For example, when a\ncause is understood as being actual rather than merely potential, does\nour conception of it qua cause change in any way? Aristotle\nleaves this ambiguous in Metaphysics V.2, but some medieval\nphilosophers thought it necessary to posit an additional state of\naffairs to explain the dynamic aspect of causality, i.e., the fact\nthat a contingent state of affairs needs to be brought about by some\nagent. Thus, if we think of God as the cause of Socrates, there must\nbe something else, God's-being-the-cause-of-Socrates (deum esse\ncausam Sortis), distinct from both God and Socrates, to account\nfor his existence. This \u2018something else\u2019 then becomes not\nonly what is signified by the proposition \u2018God is the cause of\nSocrates\u2019 (complexe significabile), but also the proper\nobject of our knowledge that God is the cause of Socrates. Buridan\nreplies by arguing that philosophers who think this way do not know\nhow to interpret human discourse. They take everything too\nliterally. But we should not be misled by what a proposition literally\nsays, or seems to say, into thinking that there must be some new kind\nof entity corresponding to God's being the cause of Socrates,\nespecially since such reifying moves do not help us to understand what\nis happening when a cause actually causes (QM V.7\u20138: 30va\u201333ra).\n\n\nThe same sensitivity to questions of interpretation is evident in\nhis treatment of propositions in natural philosophy, where he argues\nthat we can meaningfully use propositions containing terms such as\n\u2018infinite [infinitum]\u2019 and \u2018point\n[punctum]\u2019 to express actual states of affairs without\ncommitting ourselves to the existence of infinite magnitudes or\nindivisible points. The key is to realize that propositions do not\nalways wear their meanings on their sleeves. Their component terms can\nbe differently construed (e.g., categorematically or\nsyncategorematically), and can even perform different modal functions,\nwhich, depending on how the proposition is read (e.g., in a composite\nor divided sense) can change its truth\n conditions.[12]\n There will be ambiguities, of course, but Buridan is steadfast in his\nassumption that the rational inquirer will always be able to sort them\nout, given the right dialectical tools.\n4. Logic\n\n\nFollowing Aristotle and Porphyry, Buridan's logic is based on two\ndistinct, but complementary, conceptions of its purpose: theoretical or\npedagogical (logica docens) and practical (logica\n utens).[13]\n The former, he says, is so called because \u201cit teaches\n[docet] us how, and from what [materials], arguments should\nbe constructed, whether those arguments be demonstrative, dialectical,\nor of some other kind\u201d. The latter takes its name from the fact\nthat \u201cit uses [utitur] arguments in order to prove\nwhether some conclusion is evident, regardless of the subject matter\nof the conclusion\u201d (QIP 1: 126\u20137, ll.176\u201380). But since the\nteaching of logic is ordained to its use, Buridan holds that logic is\nultimately a practical rather than a speculative discipline.\n\n\nHistorians of logic usually classify Buridan among the terminists or\n\u2018moderns\u2019, a diverse group of thirteenth and\nfourteenth-century logicians who regarded the semantic properties of\nterms (literally, the \u2018ends [termini]\u2019, or\nsubjects and predicates, of propositions) as the primary unit of\nlogical analysis.  As we saw above, in addition to commenting on\nAristotle's Organon, he wrote a logical compendium, the\nSummulae de dialectica, ostensibly as a commentary on Peter\nof Spain's Summulae logicales, an influential terminist\ntextbook written a century earlier. But Buridan's Summulae\nwas essentially a new work, more that ten times longer than the\noriginal and featuring many new and completely rewritten sections. In\nit, Buridan leads his students and readers through an orderly\nprogression of teachings, beginning with propositions (Treatise I),\nshifting down to the signification and referential function of their\ncomponent terms (II-IV), then back up to terms and propositions\ninsofar as they figure in more complex patterns of reasoning:\nsyllogisms (V), topics (VI), fallacies (VII), and finally,\ndemonstrations (VIII). The work concludes with a kind of exercise book\non paradoxical and otherwise puzzling propositions, showing how they\ncan be resolved using the techniques of the previous eight\ntreatises.\n\n\nNo encyclopedia article can do justice to the richness and variety of\nBuridan's logic; it was interest in logic that first revived the study\nof his work fifty years ago, and logic remains the one area in which\nBuridan can speak directly to modern philosophical audiences.  The\nmain reason for this is that Buridan's project of developing a\ntoken-based semantics to ground his nominalist ontology is shared by\nmany philosophers of language today; likewise, the method of\nhis Treatise on Consequences has been rightly described by\nHubert Hubien as \u201cvery modern: we have here what is without doubt the\nfirst attempt, albeit very imperfect, at an axiomatic exposition of\nlogic on the basis of the propositional\ncalculus.\u201d[14]\nNevertheless, this section will have the more modest aim of showing\nshowing how Buridan practiced the dialectical art and influenced logic\nand semantics well into the sixteenth century.\n\n\nFirst, Buridan did much to streamline and better articulate the\nmethods of terminist logic. The most important analytical tool in the\nSummulae is the doctrine of suppositio\n[supposition], which had been a feature of terminist logic for several\ngenerations by the time Buridan arrived in Paris. Terms were thought\nto possess two general semantic properties: signification, or what a\nterm \u2018makes known\u2019 in the mind of the person who sees it\nor hears it or conceives of it, whether mediately or immediately\n(thus, the written term \u2018Socrates\u2019 brings to mind the\nconcept of Socrates, which in turn signifies the actual person); and\nsupposition, which refers to the capacity of certain substantive terms\nto stand for or \u2018pick out\u2019 something in a particular\ncontext, such as in a proposition. Although the analogy is not\nperfect, supposition performs many of the same functions as what we\nwould call the theory of\n reference.[15]\n Traditional accounts divided supposition into proper supposition,\nwhere a term is used with its typical or standard meaning, and\nimproper supposition, where a term is used in some metaphorical or\nfigurative sense. Most logicians went on to distinguish three kinds of\nproper supposition: personal, where a term stands for what it\nsignifies (e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019 in \u2018Socrates is a\nman\u2019); material, where it stands for itself (e.g.,\n\u2018man\u2019 in \u2018Man has three letters\u2019); and simple,\nwhere it stands for a common nature or concept (e.g.,\n\u2018man\u2019 in \u2018Man is a species\u2019). Simple\nsupposition appears to have been a vestige of early terminist\n logic,[16]\n whose realist practitioners needed to distinguish between referring\nto a universal thing and referring to a particular thing. But by the\nfourteenth century, the whole notion of universals had become more\ncontroversial, and nominalist logicians in particular were not about\nto accept any special device for referring to them through common\nterms such as \u2018man\u2019. So simple supposition was readapted\nto model reference to common concepts or intentions. Thus, Ockham\nholds that a term exhibits simple supposition when it supposits\n\u201cfor a concept in the mind [pro conceptu\nmentis],\u201d and is not being used\n significatively.[17]\n What united Ockham and his terminist predecessors was their\nrealization that if the proposition \u2018Man is a species\u2019 is\nto be true, then the term \u2018man\u2019 cannot supposit personally\nfor any of the individual men it ultimately signifies, since it cannot\nbe said of any of them that he is a species (Socrates is a man, not a\nspecies).  Accordingly, the reference of \u2018man\u2019 must be to\na common nature or concept.\n\n\nBut Buridan contends that there are only two ways a term can stand\nfor something in a proposition, personally and materially:\nOf the first [section on the divisions of supposition], we\nshould realize that some people have posited also a third member,\nwhich they call \u2018simple supposition\u2019. For they [e.g.,\nPeter of Spain] held that universal natures are distinct from the\nsingulars outside of the soul. And so they said that a term supposits\npersonally when it supposits for the singulars themselves, that it\nsupposits simply when it supposits for that material nature, and\nmaterially when it supposits for itself. But I hold that Aristotle\ncorrectly refuted that opinion in the seventh book of the\nMetaphysics [VII.3.1038b1\u20131039a23] and so this kind of\nsupposition has to be eliminated, at least according to this\ninterpretation. In another manner, others [e.g., Ockham] call\nsupposition \u2018simple\u2019 when an utterance supposits for the\nconcept according to which it is imposed and material when it\nsupposits for itself or another similar to itself. And this can be\npermitted, but I do not care [about this usage], for I call both\n\u2018material supposition\u2019. (S 4.3.2: 253)\n\n\nBuridan sees that it is misleading to assign a special logical sense\nto terms being used to refer to themselves or to the concepts they\nexpress, as if this were any different from figurative or metaphorical\nusage, since only terms that refer to things existing per se\nare being used in their proper sense. Thus, terms can stand either for\nthe things they ordinarily signify, in which case they supposit\npersonally, or for something else, in which case they supposit\nmaterially. Material supposition applies whenever a term is used in\nsome way that departs from the meaning imposed upon it by the\nlinguistic community:\nan utterance does not have any proper import [virtus\npropria] in signifying and suppositing, except from ourselves. So\nby an agreement of the disputing parties, as in obligational disputes,\nwe can impose on it a new signification, and not use it according to\nits common signification. We can also speak figuratively\n[transsumptive] and ironically, according to a different\nsignification. But we call a locution \u2018proper\u2019 when we use\nit according to the signification properly and principally given to it,\nand we call a locution \u2018improper\u2019 when we use it otherwise,\nalthough we legitimately can use it otherwise. So it is absurd to say\nthat a proposition of an author is false, absolutely speaking, if he\nputs it forth incorporating an improper locution, according to which it\nis true. Instead, we ought to say that it is true, since it is\nenunciated according to the sense in which it is true. (S 4.3.2:\n256)\n\n\nNotice that the default interpretation of a term is its proper\nsense, defined as \u201cthe signification properly and principally\ngiven to it\u201d. The proper signification of a term must be based on\nthe fact that \u201cutterances were primarily and principally imposed\nto signify so as to stand for their ultimate significata, and\nnot for themselves\u201d (S 4.3.2:\n 256);[18]\n that is to say, just as concepts (at least in the first instance)\nnaturally signify those extra-mental things that just as naturally\ngive rise to them, so spoken and written terms (at least in the first\ninstance) are imposed to signify, via their corresponding concepts,\nthe same ultimate\n significata.[19]\n For Buridan, this capacity is natural to us as creatures endowed with\nthe power of cognition. It is why he insists that determining the\nnature of concepts pertains not to logic but to psychology or\nmetaphysics, speculative sciences whose conclusions cannot be\notherwise (QDI I.3:6, ll.\n 4\u201310).[20]\n So even if we say that the proposition, \u2018Man is a\nspecies\u2019 is true insofar as it is put forward in the context of\nAristotle's Categories, it is not literally true, or true\naccording to \u201cthe signification properly and principally given\nto it\u201d, because of no per se existing man is it true to\nsay that he is a species. What happens is that when we work on the\nCategories, we follow Aristotle's lead and depart from\nconventional usage in such a way that the term \u2018man\u2019\nsupposits not for individual men but for the universal concept\naccording to which it was imposed to signify, in which case the\nproposition is true because \u201cspecies and genera are universals\naccording to predication\u201d (S 4.3.2: 254). So it can be true that\nman is a species without it being literally true that man is\na species.\n\n\nThe second way in which Buridan changed the dialectical landscape\nwas to extend the range of traditional logic. There are numerous\nexamples of this, not all of which are uncontroversial because it is often\nhard to tell what Buridan intended to achieve by a given innovation\n(this goes for other medieval logicians as\n well).[21]\n But a fairly uncontroversial example can be found in his use of\nsupposition to examine the structure of certain complex terms that\nwould remain unanalyzed on the traditional account of syllogistic\ninferences. Of particular importance here is the doctrine of\nampliation. Thus, although the syllogism, \u2018Nothing dead is an\nanimal, some man is dead; therefore, some man is not an animal\u2019,\nis an acceptable fourth-mode syllogism of the first figure\n(Ferio), Buridan denies that the consequence is\n\u201cformally valid\u201d. The reason is that in this syllogism,\n\u2018man\u2019 is an ampliative term, and \u201cfrom an ampliated\nnondistributed term the same term does not follow nonampliated\u201d\nthat is, \u201cin the minor proposition the term \u2018man\u2019\nwas ampliated to past [things], whereas in the conclusion it was not\nampliated,\u201d making the premises true but the conclusion false (S\n5.3.2: 326; cf. QAnPr I.14). Similarly, terms referring to the divine\npersons sometimes generate counterexamples to the traditionally\naccepted modes. Thus, \u201cthe following syllogism in\nBarbara is invalid: \u2018Every God is the son, every divine\nFather is God; therefore every divine Father is the Son\u201d, for\nthe transitivity of identity fails in cases \u201cwhere the most\nsimple unity is a trinity of really distinct persons\u201d (S 5.3.2:\n327). Buridan also urges the reader to be wary of modal contexts\nintroduced by verbs of knowing and believing because \u201cthe verb\n\u2018know\u2019 ampliates the subject to supposit not only for\npresent things, but also for future and past ones\u201d. This means\nthat without suitable qualification, \u201calthough I know that every\nman is an animal, nevertheless, it does not follow that every man is\nknown by me to be an animal; for then it would follow that every man,\nwhether alive or dead or yet to be born, would be known by me to be an\nanimal, which is false\u201d (S 5.6.8: 348). What is noteworthy in\nthese and other examples is Buridan's use of the doctrine of\nsupposition to extend the range of \u2018truth-makers\u2019 for\nmodal inferences, e.g., in his assumption that \u201cthe presence of\na modal copula\u2014any modal copula\u2014in a proposition\nampliates the subject to stand for not only the actual things but also\nthe possible things that fall under that\n term\u201d.[22]\n Because it makes merely possible objects relevant to the evaluation\nof modal inferences, ampliation can be seen as a kind of Buridanian\nequivalent of possible worlds semantics, though it would be a mistake\nto regard it as a remarkable anticipation of that twentieth-century\ndoctrine. Buridan's remarks on its theoretical significance are\n few,[23]\n and, despite the degree of technical sophistication involved, he\nprobably did not see it as a radical innovation, but as part of his\nongoing effort to make existing schemes for checking inferences more\npracticable.\n\n\nThird, and finally, Buridan made major contributions to certain\nforms of logical inquiry that originated in the medieval period. Most\nmodern logicians know of his solutions to alethic paradoxes such as the\nLiar, addressed in the eighth and final chapter of ninth\ntreatise of the Summulae, which belongs to the medieval\nliterature of sophismata or\n insolubilia.[24]\n The 7th sophism Buridan considers is \u2018Every proposition is\nfalse\u2019.  The case posits \u201cthat all true propositions are\nannihilated while the false ones remain [in existence], and then\nSocrates propounds only this [proposition]: \u2018Every proposition\nis false\u2019\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 965). The question is then\nasked whether Socrates's proposition is true or false. The arguments\non each side of the question illustrate the difficulties one faces if\n\u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 are interpreted\nstrictly. The argument that it is false assumes that \u201cit is\nimpossible for the same proposition to be true and false when\npropounded in the same language and understood in the same way by\neveryone hearing it\u201d, and proceeds to argue that the sophism is\nfalse because any proposition which entails its own contradictory is\nimpossible, and therefore false. The opposite side begins by focusing\non the logical form of the sophism as a universal affirmative that has\nno counter-instance in the case at hand, which stated that all true\npropositions have been annihilated with only the false ones\nremaining. Second, the sophism must be true because the subject and\npredicate terms supposit for the same things: if every proposition is\nfalse, then each and every propositional significate of the term\n\u2018every proposition\u2019 must be false, as it indeed is,\naccording to the case. Finally, the sophism must be true because\n\u201cit signifies only that every proposition is false; and this is\nhow things are [ita est]\u201d, according to the case (S\n9.8, 7th sophism: 965).\n\n\nBuridan writes as if this particular sophism enjoyed some notoriety\namong logic teachers at Paris, although all but one of the alternative\nsolutions he mentions were discussed and criticized from the very\nbeginning of the insolubilia literature. These involve various\nad hoc proposals that either build new assumptions into the\ncase or else make up new rules about how the terms of the sophism are\nto be\n interpreted.[25]\n Into the first category falls a solution known as the\n\u2018transcasus\u2019, which involves the bizarre\nsuggestion that the time Socrates utters his proposition and the time\nreferred to by the verb of the proposition are not the same.  This\nwould allow us to say that if there are no true propositions during\nthe first hour of a certain day, Socrates could utter his proposition\nat the end of this hour and it would be true, where he is understood\nas referring \u201cnot to the time at which he speaks but to the time\nof that first hour\u201d. But this is of no help if we stick to the\ncase and assume that the times are the same.  Alternatively, in a\nsolution advocated by the \u2018restringentes\n[restrictors]\u2019\u2014so-called because they avoided self-reference\nby restricting what a term can supposit for\u2014we could make the\nproposition non-reflexive by stipulating that \u201cterms that are\napt to supposit for propositions are not put in propositions to\nsupposit for the propositions in which they are put, but for\nothers\u201d. But Buridan rightly rejects this second strategy as\nfailing to take seriously our conventional understanding of terms, for\nwhen one uses the term \u2018proposition\u2019, he says, \u201cone\nunderstands indifferently all propositions, indeed, present, past, and\nfuture ones, his own as well as those of another person\u201d. A\nmoment's reflection should make it obvious that \u201cthis solution\nis worth nothing: for what one understands, of that he can speak\n[quod aliquis intelligit, de hoc potest loqui]\u201d (S 9.8,\n7th sophism:\n 966).[26]\n\n\nBuridan's quick answer to the sophism is that Socrates's proposition\nis false in the case at hand. But before moving on to his final answer,\nhe first discusses a solution described as being held by some people,\nincluding\n himself.[27]\n This is that there is another condition, in addition to the\nrequirement that its terms stand for the same thing or things, which a\nproposition must meet if it is to be true. A proposition must also\nsignify or assert itself to be true (S 9.8, 7th sophism:\n 967).[28]\n In her detailed analysis of this sophism,\nFabienne Pironet has shown that the text in which Buridan defends this\nearlier view is his question commentary on Aristotle's Posterior\nAnalytics, where it is expressed in terms of the traditional\nformula that \u201chowsoever [a proposition] signifies, so it is\n[qualitercumque significat, ita est]\u201d (QAnPo\n I.10).[29]\n Now Buridan holds that all propositions satisfy this condition\ntrivially: \u201cevery proposition by its form signifies or asserts\nitself to be true\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 967). The problem with\nself-referential paradoxes is that they also seem to signify that they\nare false. Thus, although the proposition \u2018I say what is false\n[ego dico falsum]\u2019 \u201csignifies itself to be true\nin some fashion, nevertheless this is not so entirely, or howsoever it\nsignifies [licet aliqualiter sic significat, non tamen totaliter\nvel qualitercumque ita est].  Therefore it is false\u201d (QAnPo\nI.10).\n\n\nUnfortunately, this looks no less ad hoc than the\ntranscasus and restriction solutions he has just criticized.\nWhy shouldn't other propositions, besides the paradoxical ones, be\nable to signify that they are false? Buridan does not say in his\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics, and in the\nSummulae he rejects his earlier view for the rather different\nreason that it is false \u201cthat every proposition signifies or\nasserts itself to be true\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 968). His\nargument is not exactly clear, but the problem appears to be semantic:\nhe cannot find an interpretation of the phrase \u2018itself to be\ntrue [se esse veram]\u2019 in the supplementary condition\nthat will permit it to function as a general principle. Consider the\nproposition \u2018A man is an animal [homo est\nanimal]\u2019. If we understand it materially, i.e., as standing\nfor a proposition, then it will signify \u2018The proposition\n\u201cA man is an animal\u201d is true\u2019, which is false\nbecause it refers to second intentions (concepts or signs by means of\nwhich we conceive of other concepts or signs as such), and the\noriginal proposition refers to things (human beings and animals), not\nconcepts. But what if we say that a proposition signifies itself to be\ntrue if it is taken significatively for the things or first\nintentions, rather than materially? This will not work either, argues\nBuridan, because then the affirmative proposition \u2018A man is a\ndonkey [homo est asinus]\u2019 would signify that a man is a\ndonkey, which is false because the subject term \u2018man\u2019 does\nnot supposit for anything (no human beings are\n donkeys).[30]\n Accordingly, we cannot base our solution to self-referential\nparadoxes on the idea that every proposition signifies or asserts\nitself to be\n true.[31]\n\n\nThe solution Buridan finally settles on receives the somewhat tepid\nendorsement of being \u201ccloser to the truth\u201d than the\nprevious solution\u2014a reflection, perhaps, of his awareness of the\nimperfectability of any formal system that tries to stick close to the\nfacts of human language. Here, the idea that a proposition formally\nsignifies itself to be true is replaced by the notion of implication\nfrom the doctrine of consequences. \u201cEvery proposition,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cvirtually implies another proposition in which the\npredicate \u2018true\u2019 is affirmed of the subject that supposits\nfor [the original proposition]\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism:\n 969).[32]\n Unlike the old solution, in which the second proposition is signified\nby the first and hence part of its meaning, the new solution assumes\nonly that the second proposition follows logically from the first, so\nthat its meaning can be expounded separately. In this way, for the\ntruth of any proposition P, it is required not only (1) that the\nsubject and predicate terms of P stand for the same thing or\n things,[33]\n but also (2) that P implies another proposition,\n\u2018P is true\u2019, which must also be true. Otherwise,\nwe would have a true antecedent and a false consequent, violating\nBuridan's fifth theorem regarding assertoric consequences, which\nstates, \u201cit is impossible for what is false to follow from what\nis true [impossibile est ex veris sequi falsum]\u201d (TC\nI.8: 34, l. 97; Read (tr.) 2015: 77\u201378). Applying this to the 7th sophism, the constituent\nterms in the proposition uttered by Socrates\u2014\u2018Every\nproposition\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019\u2014stand for the same\nthings, since in the posited case, \u201call true propositions are\nannihilated and the false ones remain, and then Socrates propounds\nonly this: \u2018Every proposition is false\u2019\u201d. So the\nfirst condition is satisfied. But the implied proposition,\n\u2018P is true\u2019 (where P is the name of\n\u2018Every proposition is false\u2019), is false because its\nconstituent terms, \u2018Every proposition is false\u2019 and\n\u2018true\u2019, do not stand for the same thing, since ex\nhypothesi, P stands for the antecedent proposition\n\u2018Every proposition is false\u2019, not for things that are\ntrue. But this gives us a true antecedent and a false consequent, and\nso the consequence does not hold. Therefore, the sophism is false.\n5. Metaphysics\n\n\nBuridan's metaphysics is thoroughly informed by his logic. He tries\nwherever possible to apply the Summulae's analytical\ntechniques to solve problems in speculative philosophy. His approach\nis critical in the sense that he tends to view traditional problems in\nmetaphysics as based on confusions of logic or language. For the same\nreason, his solutions are not original in the modern sense of being\nwithout precedent, although they have few equals in terms of their\nelegance and economy of expression. Where philosophical argumentation\nis concerned, Buridan is a master craftsman.\n\n\nLike most arts masters in fourteenth-century Paris, Buridan is careful\nto dissociate the metaphysical questions he asks as a philosopher from\nsimilar questions that might be asked by a theologian. Jurisdictional\ndisputes forced Parisian arts masters to be quite clear about how they\nwere approaching a\n problem,[34]\n although what we now identify as medieval philosophy was practiced by\nboth sides. As far as Buridan is concerned, much of the confusion over\nthe proper domains of metaphysics and theology stems from Aristotle\nhimself, who identifies three kinds of speculative science: physics,\nmathematics, and\ntheology (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics VI.1.1026a18; XI.7.1064b1).\nIn his question commentary on the Metaphysics, he provides\nthe standard medieval interpretation of this passage, reading\n\u2018theology\u2019 as \u2018metaphysics\u2019 and\ndifferentiating the three sciences in terms of how they treat their\nrespective subjects: whereas the natural philosopher considers things\ninsofar as they are qualified by motion, and the mathematician insofar\nas they are quantified by number, the metaphysician considers them\nonly insofar as they pertain to the \u201cconcept of being [ad\nrationem essendi]\u201d (QM VI.2:\n 34ra).[35]\n For the difference between metaphysics and theology, however, we need\nto go to the very beginning of the commentary, where he offers the\nfollowing gloss of Aristotle's remarks:\nIt should also be noted that [when we ask whether\nmetaphysics is the same as wisdom,] we are not comparing metaphysics to\ntheology, which proceeds from beliefs that are not known, because\nalthough these beliefs are not known per se and most evident,\nwe hold without doubt that theology is the more principal discipline\nand that it is wisdom most properly speaking. In this question,\nhowever, we are merely asking about intellectual habits based on human\nreason, [i.e.,] those discovered by the process of reasoning, which are\ndeduced from what is evident to us. For it is in this sense that\nAristotle calls metaphysics \u2018theology\u2019 and \u2018the\ndivine science\u2019. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology\nin the fact that although each considers God and those things that\npertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what\ncan be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative\nreason. But theology has for its principles articles [of faith], which\nare believed quite apart from their evidentness, and further, considers\nwhatever can be deduced from articles of this kind. (QM I.2:\n4ra-rb)\n\n\nThe difference is that theologians take their principles\n(\u2018principia\u2019 = (lit.) \u2018starting\npoints\u2019) from articles of faith rather than, like the\nphilosophers, from what is evident to the senses and intellect. So it\nis possible for the same question\u2014e.g., about the limits of divine\nomnipotence\u2014to be raised in both domains, though it will have a\nmore creaturely orientation for the\n philosopher.[36]\n Buridan concedes de jure place of privilege to theology\nbecause of its subject matter, but treats philosophy and theology as\nde facto equivalent in the speculative realm. Metaphysics, or\nphilosophical wisdom, cannot be ordained by theology because its\nmethods, which are rooted in its principles, are different. Philosophy\nis accordingly not inferior to theology, just\n different.[37]\n\n\nWith regard to the problem of\n universals,[38]\n Buridan does not so much create a new theory as show how our\ntheoretical commitments can be expressed with a minimum of ambiguity\nand fuss. Like Ockham, he is a nominalist, although this term must be\nused with caution in later medieval philosophy because of the modern\ntendency to identify it with the denial of real universals. It must be\nremembered that most fourteenth-century philosophers were nominalists\nin this sense because they associated the contrary doctrine with\nPlato, with whom they were familiar only secondarily as one of the\nauthors whose views are thoroughly discredited by Aristotle in Book I\nof the\n Metaphysics.[39]\n But medieval nominalism involved much more than rejecting Platonic\nuniversals. Its history can be traced to twelfth-century disputes over\nthe reading of sacred texts, in which the techniques of logicians such\nas Abelard were pitted against those of grammarians such as Peter\n Helias.[40]\n As these disputes evolved and matured, nominalism was gradually\nabsorbed into the teaching of philosophers working in the faculty of\narts, so that by Buridan's time, it is better to think of nominalism\nas a practice, or way of doing philosophy, rather than as a piece of\ndoctrine.\n\n\nWhen Buridan considers questions such as \u201cwhether universals\nactually exist outside the soul\u201d (TDUI: 137), his remarks are\nalmost always aimed at clarifying the meaning of the term\n\u2018universal\u2019 with respect to other terms such as\n\u2018individual\u2019, \u2018particular\u2019, and\n\u2018singular\u2019. His rejection of realism is expressed in the\nclaim that universal terms have no ultimate significate, i.e., nothing\noutside the soul they can \u2018make known\u2019 as\n such.[41]\n Hence, an account is needed of what such terms mean. Here, it is\nalmost as if Buridan thinks there is something ill-formed about\npropositions where the term \u2018universal\u2019 occurs in the\nsubject position, for when confronted with them his first move is\nalways to tell us how the term \u2018universal\u2019 is to be\nunderstood (QIP 3: 136, ll.\n 477\u2013488).[42]\n He argues further that the primary\nsignification of \u2018universal\u2019 is \u2018predicable of\nmany\u2019, which makes it a term of second intention, or a term of\nterms, since only terms are predicable (QIP 3: 135\u2013136; 4: 139; TDUI:\n 148).[43]\n The second-intentional status of the term \u2018universal\u2019 is\nalso evident in propositions, where it does not signify a\n\u2018what\u2019 but a \u2018how\u2019, i.e., how we conceive of\nsomething\u2014in this case how the term so designated is\n\u201cindifferent to many supposits,\u201d or individuals\n (TDUI: 59; see Zupko 2013b).[44]\n As we saw above, logic is the study of terms such as\n\u2018proposition\u2019 taken materially, signifying actual tokens\nof the type (QDI I.1: 6). Moving from propositions to arguments,\nBuridan insists that terms in the premises and conclusions of\ndemonstrative arguments must be taken as standing materially, i.e.,\nfor themselves in the particular discourse conditions which surround\nthem, rather than personally, for their extra-mental significates (QIP\n1: 128, ll. 223\u2013237). Likewise, the proximate object of scientific\nknowledge is the actual demonstrated or demonstrable conclusion rather\nthan the state of affairs it signifies, although Buridan is willing to\nconcede that \u201cthe terms of those demonstrable conclusions, or\neven the things signified by those conclusions\u201d might be\nconsidered \u201cremote\u201d, or secondary, objects of knowledge\n(QIP 1: 127, l.\n 208\u2013209).[45]\n Careful and systematic analysis is the best antidote for metaphysical\nperplexity because the trouble usually begins with untutored persons\nwho use some word or concept without knowing what it means.\n\nOn the question of universals, Buridan's main contribution is to\ndevelop what Gyula Klima has nicely termed an \u201cessentialist\nnominalism\u201d, arguing for the reality of the natures underlying our\nsimple substance concepts. Ockham understood universality in terms of\nthe inherent indifference of our cognitive acts, so that despite our\nhaving had different particular experiences of horses, say, we are\nable to form complex concepts that count as universal provided they\nare able to represent all horses; crucially, there is nothing of the\nsubstantial nature of a horse that is conveyed via the senses to the\nintellect on Ockham's theory. Against this, Buridan argues that\nsubstantial concepts cannot merely be collections of complex,\nconnotative concepts, because then we would have the absurd conclusion\nthat substantial terms are not substantial terms, for the concepts\naccording to which they were imposed to signify would not be simple\nsubstance concepts:\nAgain, if the substantial concept of man were complex,\nthen let us posit that it consists of three simple ones,\nnamely, a, b, and c.  Then, if no concept of\nsubstance is simple, a can only be a concept of accident, and\nthe same goes for b and c; therefore, the whole combined\nfrom them would also be only a concept of accident, and not one of\nsubstance, for a whole is nothing over and above its parts.  But this\nis absurd, namely, that the substantial concept of man should be\nnothing but a concept of accidents; therefore, etc. [QP I.4,\ned. Streijger & Bakker: 36, ll. 3\u20139; tr. Klima 2009:\n95]\n\nBuridan proceeds to identify four ways in which one can obtain one\nsimple cognition from another directly, or without any inference [QP\nI.4, ed. Streijger & Bakker: \n36\u201337].[46] \nThe details need not detain us here, but\nsuffice it to say that the \u201cempiricist\u201d side of Buridan's nominalism\nis always leavened by Aristotelian naturalism, which he felt was\nneeded to combat skeptical arguments about scientific knowledge, and\nindeed, about the very existence of substances\u2014arguments Ockham\nnever had to confront.\n\n\nIt also should be noted that Buridan's methods do not always produce\nparsimonious results. Like Ockham, he has only substances and qualities\nin his basic ontology, but he is much more willing than Ockham to\nexpand this in the direction of modes or ways of being when confronted\nwith recalcitrant phenomena. Thus, he argues that we must treat the\nquestion of how something is as distinct from what it\nis if we are to have a coherent understanding of motion, especially\nsince the Ockhamist view is forced to posit an infinite succession of\nspatial qualities (QM V.9: 32va; QP II.3, ed. Streijger & \nBakker, 256\u2013263; QP IV.11, ed. Streijger & Bakker,\n 299\u2013305).[47]\n Likewise, in a famous passage, Buridan is driven by his own\nexperience to reject Ockham's explanation of condensation and\nrarefaction as kinds of locomotion. Why, he asks, does he find himself\nunable to compress further the air in a bellows which has been stopped\nup at one end? Not because of its matter, since more matter could\nexist in a much smaller space; nor because of the substantial form of\nthe air, which would fill a much smaller space once it has been\ncooled; nor even because of the heat it possesses, since more heat\ncould exist in a much smaller space, such as at the end of a red-hot\npoker. No, the air must have a distinct quantitative form or magnitude\npreventing it from being moved. Against those who would do away with\nthis distinction, Buridan argues that \u201ca distinct magnitude of this sort\nhas not been posited in vain, for we have been forced to posit it\nby compelling arguments that make it seem as useful or even more useful to\nnatural philosophy than [the qualities of] whiteness or\nblackness\u201d (QP I.8, ed. Streijger & Bakker, 92, ll. \n3\u20136).[48]\n6. Natural Philosophy\n\n\nMedieval natural philosophy included both the rich commentary\ntradition on Aristotle's Physics, as well as treatises and\ncommentaries on Aristotle's other writings about the natural world:\nOn the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption, De\nanima, the short treatises on animate powers known as the\n\u2018Parva Naturalia\u2019, and the works on the history,\nparts, and generation of animals. Buridan wrote commentaries on nearly\nall of these texts. Like his contemporaries, he understood the\nspeculative sub-disciplines of physics as an orderly progression of\nteachings. Thus, demonstration in psychology was thought to borrow its\nprinciples or starting points from physics, the higher science to\nwhich it is subordinated, with its conclusions in turn supplying\nprinciples for demonstrations in the more specialized studies of\nsensation and animal locomotion. The ordering metaphor is never far\nfrom Buridan's mind. He remarks to readers of his commentary on\nAristotle's De motibus animalium that in this book, \u201cwe\ndescend to the different species of motion in particular, e.g., to the\nfact that some animals fly, others swim, and so on\u201d (DMA I:\n535)\n\n\nBesides logic, natural philosophy is the other field in which Buridan\nhas enjoyed some recognition. This is largely due to the efforts of\nthe pioneering historians of science Pierre Duhem and Anneliese Maier,\nwho saw that Buridan played a key role in the demise of the\nAristotelian view of the\n cosmos.[49]\n Buridan's major contribution here was to develop and popularize the\ntheory of impetus, or impressed force, to explain projectile\nmotion. Rejecting the discredited Aristotelian idea of antiperistasis,\naccording to which the tendency of a thrown projectile to continue\nmoving is due to a proximate but external moving cause (such as the\nair surrounding\n it),[50]\n he argues that only an internal motive force, transmitted from the\nmover to the projectile, could explain its continued motion. The\ntheory of impetus probably did not originate with\n Buridan,[51]\n but his account appears to be unique in that he entertains the\npossibility that it might not be self-dissipating: \u201cafter\nleaving the arm of the thrower, the projectile would be moved by an\nimpetus given to it by the thrower,\u201d he says, \u201cand would\ncontinue to be moved as long as the impetus remained stronger than the\nresistance, and would be of infinite duration were it not diminished\nand corrupted by a contrary force resisting it or by something\ninclining it to a contrary motion\u201d (QM XII.9: 73ra). He also\ncontends that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined\nby the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject, so that the\nacceleration of a falling body can be understood in terms of its\ngradual accumulation of units of impetus. But despite its\nrevolutionary implications, Buridan did not use the concept of impetus\nto transform the science of mechanics. He was not, as Duhem argued, a\nforerunner of Galileo. He remained unapologetically Aristotelian in\ntoo many other respects, continuing to hold that motion and rest are\ncontrary states of bodies and that the world is finite in\nextent. Buridan seems to have been a philosopher who, though well\naware of the shortcomings of the Aristotelian natural philosophy,\ntried to reshape as much of it as he could in the face of a rapidly\nmechanizing\n worldview.[52]\n His revolution was in the details. The big, decisive break was left\nto his successors.\n\n\nBuridan's account of motion is in keeping with his approach to natural\nscience, which is empirical in the sense that it emphasizes the\nevidentness of appearances, the reliability of a posteriori modes of\nreasoning, and the application of naturalistic tropes or models of\nexplanation (such as the concept of impetus) to a variety of\nphenomena.  He is inclined to dismiss purely theological assumptions\nas irrelevant to the practice of philosophy, as we see in the\nfollowing tongue-in-cheek remark: \u201cone might assume that there\nare many more separate substances than there are celestial spheres and\ncelestial motions, viz., great legions of angels [magnae legiones\nangelorum], but this cannot be proved by demonstrative arguments\noriginating from sense perception\u201d (QM II.9: \n73ra).[53] But there are some\ntheological considerations that must be taken seriously.  He concedes\nthat divine omnipotence is such that it is always possible for God to\ndeceive us in ways we could never detect, although this is tempered by\nhis confidence, for which he cites empirical evidence, that our\nordinary powers of perception and inductive inference are sufficiently\nreliable to make \u201cthe comprehension of truth with certitude\npossible for us\u201d (QM II.1: 9ra). He has little patience for\nskeptical arguments questioning the possibility of scientific\nknowledge, such as those he believed to have been advanced by Nicholas\nof Autrecourt, arguing that it is absurd to demand that all knowledge\nbe demonstrable by reduction to the principle of non-contradiction.\nNatural science is about what happens for the most part, i.e.,\nassuming the common course of nature (Zupko 2003, chs. 12\u201313). For the\nsame reason, explanatory models in one special science can be usually\napplied to others in a way that enhances our understanding of the\nphenomena. Thus, the concept of impetus recurs in Buridan's psychology\nto explain the difference between occurrent and dispositional\nthinking, as well as in his ethics, to account for the relative ease\nwith which virtuous persons are able to do the right thing (they have\nacquired, or cultivated within themselves, an impetus to act\nvirtuously).\n\n\nIn psychology, the study of moving beings qua animate,\nBuridan changed the Aristotelian paradigm in important ways. In\ncontrast with Thomas Aquinas, who wanted to attribute metaphysically\nmore robust qualities, such as per se subsistence, to the\nhuman soul, Buridan does not think that psychology is in a position to\nreveal anything about the inherent nature of its subject, and so he\nrefuses to speculate about it (Zupko 2007a). He sees the science of\npsychology as concerned not with some quidditative concept of the soul\narrived at by a priori reasoning, but with specifying the\nrelation between animate qualities and the soul as their proper\nsubject: \u201cthe natural philosopher only studies substances in\nrelation to their motion and operations (see Zupko 2007b, 2008,\n2017ab). And since natural forms require for their operations a\ndeterminate matter made suitable for them by qualitative and\nquantitative dispositions, natural scientists must define forms\nthrough their proper matter. Therefore, in its natural definition, the\nsoul must be defined by means of a physical, organic body\u201d (QDA\nII.3). This led to an even more attenuated conception of the soul in\nthe De anima commentaries of Buridan's Parisian successors,\nNicole Oresme and Peter of Ailly, for whom the soul functions as a\nkind of placeholder whose nature is not even relevant to psychology.\nConsideration of the soul's ultimate nature migrated to the faculty of\ntheology, where it was considered along with the same Augustinian\ndreaming arguments that undoubtedly influenced Descartes (See Zupko\n1999 and 2003, chs. 10\u201311).\n7. Ethics\n\n\nBuridan's commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is\none of his most influential works, though it is today perhaps the least\nstudied (Zupko 2013a). It contains significant discussions of the structure of the\nwill and its relation to the intellect, the nature of human freedom,\nthe phenomenon of akrasia or weakness of will, practical\nreason, and the unity of the\n virtues.[54]\n\n\nIn moral psychology, Buridan appears to effect a compromise between\ntwo rival views on the relation between the will and the intellect: the\nintellectualist or naturalist tradition associated with Aristotle and\nThomas Aquinas, according to which the will is always subordinate to\nthe intellect, and the voluntarist tradition of Augustine and\nFranciscan thinkers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, which\nheld that the will is sometimes capable of acting autonomously.\nBuridan's apparent compromise is to argue (with the intellectualists)\nthat human happiness ultimately consists in an intellectual act,\n\u201cthe perfect apprehension of God\u201d, rather than in a\nvolitional act such as perfectly willing or perfectly loving God (QNE\nX.5: 213rb), although he emphasizes (with the voluntarists) the role of\nthe will as a self-determining power in achieving that end. The\ncompromise turns on Buridan's innovative conception of free choice,\nwhich develops Albert the Great's notion that certainty admits of\n degrees (see Saarinen 1993, 161\u201393).\n The idea is that even if the will lacks\nthe power to choose evil as such, it is still able to defer its choice\nand do nothing if the goodness of one of the alternatives presented to\nit is unclear or uncertain. Of course, given our poor epistemic\nposition in this life, it almost always has this power because it\nis almost always possible to doubt the goodness of a\nproposed course of action. The compromise is only apparent, however,\nbecause it turns out that the will's act of deferment is possible only\nif \u201cthe intellect would judge it to be good to consider the\nmatter further\u201d (QNE III.5:\n 44va).[55]\n This claim, together with his assumptions that the will can only\nchoose non-optimally through ignorance or impediment (QNE III.3\u20135; 9),\nplaces deferment squarely within the jurisdiction of the intellect,\nwhich must weigh the relative goodness of different possible courses\nof action, including deferment. It is not the case that the will can\nchoose to defer regardless of what the intellect decides, or that the\nwill can choose to defer even if the intellect has judged deferment to\nbe less good than some other course of action. Accordingly, if this is\na compromise between the intellectualists and the voluntarists, it is\na disingenuous one. It is more likely that Buridan simply appropriated\nvoluntarist terminology to express what is otherwise a\nstraightforwardly intellectualist account of the will, perhaps to\ndispel the cloud of heterodoxy which had surrounded intellectualist\nmoral psychology since the Condemnation of\n 1277.[56]\n\n\nIt is also in Buridan's moral psychology that we find the most\nplausible explanation of the example which has come down to us known as\n\u2018Buridan's Ass\u2019, in which a donkey starves to death because\nit has no reason to choose between two equidistant and equally tempting\npiles of hay. This particular example is nowhere to be found in\nBuridan's writings, although there are versions of it going back at\nleast to Aristotle (see De Caelo\n 295b32).[57]\n The best explanation of its association with Buridan is that it\noriginated as a parody of his account of free choice by later critics,\nwho found absurd the idea that the will's freedom could consist in\ninaction, i.e., in its ability to defer or \u2018send back\u2019 for\nfurther consideration any practical judgment which is not absolutely\ncertain.\n",
