    "main_text": "General Approaches to Hyperintensionality || Structured Propositions\n4.5 Structured Propositions\n\nAfter Soames\u2019 (1987) attack against unstructured accounts of\npropositions as sets of truth-supporting circumstances, structured\npropositions accounts (King 1995) have become the main rivals to SPWS\nviews. Roughly: propositions are taken as structures, composed of the\nentities which are the semantic values of the corresponding\nsentences\u2019 syntactic constituents. Take \u201cRobin loves\nBatman\u201d. It\u2019s composed of a noun, \u201cRobin\u201d, and\na verb phrase, \u201cloves Batman\u201d, itself made of a verb and a\nnoun. Let the semantic values of the lexical items be: [Robin],\n[Batman], [loving]. Then the corresponding proposition can be\ntaken as an ordered triple \\(\\langle\\)[Robin], [loving],\n[Batman]\\(\\rangle\\). Ordering is important: Batman may not return the\nfeeling, and \u201cBatman loves Robin\u201d expresses a different\nproposition: \\(\\langle\\)[Batman], [loving],\n[Robin]\\(\\rangle\\). (A proposition is not just an ordered\nlist, but we leave aside the difficult metaphysical issue of what ties\nits constituents together: see Gaskin 2008.)\n\nWhat makes for the constituents? Broadly Russellian\nstructured accounts, developed by authors like Salmon (1986), Soames\n(2008), are typically paired with direct reference or Millian accounts\nof names: thus, [Batman] is Batman and [Robin] is Robin. The semantic\nvalues of predicates and verb phrases can be taken as properties or\nrelations. The logical vocabulary is typically interpreted as denoting\nlogical operations, e.g., [\\({\\sim}\\)] can be the unary function that\nflips truth and falsity, [\\(\\land\\)] the binary function that outputs\ntruth only if both inputs are truths, etc.\n\nThis delivers hyperintensional distinctions, e.g., \u201cJohn is\neither a bachelor or not\u201d and \u201cEither 44 is the sum of two\nprimes or not\u201d will express different propositions: only one\nwill include [John], i.e., John, as a constituent. Necessarily\ntrue/false atomic sentences will also be differentiated, even when\ntheir syntactic structure is the same (\u201cHobbes squared the\ncircle\u201d and \u201cDaniel Nolan squared the circle\u201d:\n[Daniel Nolan] isn\u2019t [Hobbes]; \u201c\\(3 + 3 = 6\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d: [3] isn\u2019t [2]). More challenging\ncases for the view come with the necessary a posteriori.\n\u201cMike is Mike\u201d and \u201cMike is Jack the Ripper\u201d\nexpress the same proposition, because [Mike] = [Jack the Ripper]. Same\nfor \u201cAll woodchucks are woodchucks\u201d, \u201cAll woodchucks\nare whistlepigs\u201d, as [woodchuck] = [whistlepig]. This will\ncreate issues in intentional contexts:\n\n\nSuppose Tama is familiar with both woodchucks and whistlepigs, but\nisn\u2019t sure that they are the same kind of critter. He\u2019s\nnoticed the similarities, though, and so he has his suspicions.\nSuppose further that Tama knows he is allergic to whistlepigs, and\nknows that he has just been bitten by a woodchuck. In this scenario,\n[\u201cTama fears that all woodchucks are whistlepigs\u201d] is\nlikely true, while [\u201cTama fears that all woodchucks are\nwoodchucks\u201d] is almost certainly false. (Ripley 2012: 9)\n\n\nSoames (1987) proposes a pragmatic-metalinguistic strategy similar to\nthe one tried by Stalnaker (1984), discussed in\n \u00a72.2:\n one should distinguish attitudes towards sentences and towards\npropositions. Soames comes up with examples showing that the former\ncan be an unreliable guide to the latter, e.g., one can sometimes\nbelieve a proposition, but only assent to one of two distinct\nsentences expressing it. You do know that Mike is Jack the\nRipper by knowing that Mike is Mike, for it\u2019s the same\nproposition. But you will assent to, or assert, only the sentence that\nreports your knowledge in the trivial clothing. Then, the ancients\nbelieved that Hesperus is Phosphorus, Tama fears that all woodchucks\nare woodchucks, and so on. If you think otherwise, it\u2019s because\nyou confuse belief reports with reports of linguistic practices.\nRipley (2012) argues that it\u2019s difficult to account for\nphenomena concerning such attitude reports by throwing them in the box\nof pragmatics and conversational implicatures: failures of\nsubstitutivity salva veritate behave in systematics ways in\ncontexts of iterated embeddings, and this calls for a systematic,\ncompositional treatment.\n\nSalmon also resorts to a distinction between \u201csemantically\nencoded\u201d and \u201cpragmatically imparted information\u201d\n(Salmon 1986: 78) for the \u201cMike is Mike\u201d vs. \u201cMike\nis Jack the Ripper\u201d cases. He introduces different\nrepresentational guises under which one can have attitudes to the\nproposition expressed by different sentences. For direct reference to\nwork, we need [Mike] to be [Jack the Ripper], but we can allow\nMike-guises to differ from Jack-the-Ripper-guises, and claim that\n(de dicto) intentional attitudes are relations to\npropositions mediated by guises: Lois Lane loves Kal-El under the\nguise of Superman, not under the guise of Clark Kent. Guises\ndon\u2019t belong in semantics but in pragmatics, and don\u2019t\ndetermine denotations.\n\nSalmon\u2019s view can in principle account for compositional\nphenomena involving embeddings. It has been criticized because of\nthis: Forbes (1987) argues that guises look too much like Fregean\nsenses in disguise. Branquinho (1990) argues that the correspondence\nmay not reduce Salmon\u2019s account to a relabelled Fregean\nview.\n\nGuises are supposed to be mobilized within attitude reports. Beyond\nattitude reports, as argued by Ripley (2012), Jago (2014), there are\nhyperintensional phenomena involving indicative and counterfactual\nconditionals structuralism doesn\u2019t seem to handle. As Jago\n(2014: 76\u20137) has it, we can be at the 1972 Ziggy Stardust Tour\nand wonder if Ziggy is David Bowie. We come up with the following:\n\n(1)\nIf Ziggy isn\u2019t Bowie, then Bowie isn\u2019t Bowie.\n(2)\nIf Bowie isn\u2019t Bowie, then Bowie isn\u2019t Bowie.\n(3)\nIf Ziggy weren\u2019t Bowie, then Bowie wouldn\u2019t be\nBowie.\n(4)\nIf Bowie weren\u2019t Bowie, then Bowie wouldn\u2019t be\nBowie.\n\n\nAll of (1)\u2013(4) have metaphysically impossible antecedents. (1)\nand (3) are plausibly false (unless one is a vacuist: see Williamson\n2007), but (2) and (4) are trivial truths. (A nonvacuist conditional\nsemantics using impossible worlds delivers just these results: see\nBerto et al. 2018.) But the structuralist has (1)\u2013(2) and\n(3)\u2013(4), respectively, express the same propositions, given that\n[Ziggy] = [Bowie]. If conditionals in general, or even only\ncounterfactuals, don\u2019t involve intentionality, guises will offer\nlittle help if they are not supposed to come into play here. However,\nthere are treatments of conditionality along the lines of epistemic\nmodals (Kratzer 1986; Lycan 2001), and the Russellian structuralist\nmay appeal to one of them, or come up with a new one.\n\nCould a broadly Fregean account of structured propositions do\nbetter? In this view, we don\u2019t take the constituents of\nstructured propositions as denotations (think objects and properties),\nrather as Fregean senses. Much now depends on how these are\nunderstood. If they are taken \u00e0 la Carnap, as functions from\nthe possible worlds of SPWS to extensions, there is little hope to\naccount for \u201cMike is Mike\u201d vs. \u201cMike is Jack the\nRipper\u201d cases. Now [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] are functions\nfrom possible worlds to individuals; but unless one clashes with the\nKripkean criticisms of descriptivism on names (Kripke 1980), they had\nbetter be constant functions: given that they both actually pick out\nMike, they should output Mike at all possible worlds (at which Mike\nexists). But then [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] will be defined on the\nsame set of things and will give the same output for any input.\n\nOne may enlarge or change the set of circumstances that provides the\ninputs, admitting metaphysically impossible situations where Mike is\ndistinct from Jack the Ripper, and have the two as the outputs of\n[Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] there, respectively. But then, as\nremarked by Ripley (2012) and Jago (2014) again, it is not so much\nstructuralism that does the job of giving the required\nhyperintensional distinctions, but rather the fact that we are not\nworking (only) with standard (metaphysically) possible worlds\nanymore.\n\nA recent interesting proposal to improve on the Fregean situation\ncomes from Hawke (2018), combining a theory of subject matter with a\nstructuralist account of propositions resorting to\nFregean-senses-lookalikes. Subject matter sensitivity allows Hawke to\nmake hyperintensional distinction unavailable to standard Fregean\nstructuralism.\n\nOne logically sophisticated, neo-Fregean structured account, offering\na systematic analysis of a range of hyperintensional phenomena, is the\nTransparent Intensional Logic approach. The view, pioneered\nby Tich\u00fd (1968, 1971, 1988), treats the meanings of expressions\nas given by structural procedures, called constructions,\nbuilt out of entities that are somewhat like Fregean senses. In\nparticular, different names and different predicates, even if they\nnecessarily co-designate, may be associated with different senses, so\nthe meanings of \u201cRobin Hood\u201d and \u201cRobin of\nLocksley\u201d, or of \u201cfurze\u201d and \u201cgorse\u201d,\nmay be distinct even if those meanings are not built up out of others.\nThis gives the system resources to handle many hyperintensional\ncontexts straightforwardly. In particular, it manages to give a\npowerful compositional account where other approaches have to resort\nto pragmatics. The approach is less popular than it should be in\ncontemporary semantics, possibly due its resorting to a technical\napparatus of typed lambda-calculus. For hyperintensional applications\nand a comprehensive discussion of Transparent Intensional Logic, see\nDu\u017e\u00ed, Jespersen, and Materna (2010) and Du\u017e\u00ed\nand Jespersen (2015).\n\nWe mention one final, recent proposal in the Fregean camp, by Skipper\nand Bjerring (2020). This pivots on another Fregean notion, namely\nthat of cognitive equipollence: \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are\ncognitively equipollent when one cannot rationally regard either as\ntrue and the other as false (see Schellenberg 2012). This gives a\ncognitive or epistemic notion of sentential meaning which, the authors\nclaim, is more fine-grained than SPWS intensions, but less than\nextra-fine-grained extended (e.g., impossible) worlds semantics.\n",
