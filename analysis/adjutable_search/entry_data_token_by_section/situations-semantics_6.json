    "main_text": "Minimality and exemplification\n7. Minimality and exemplification\n\nIn possibilistic versions of situation semantics, possible situations\nare parts of possible worlds. Some authors also assume that the parts\nof a possible world w form a join semi-lattice with maximal\nelement w (Bach 1986; Lasersohn 1988, 1990; Portner 1992; see\nalso the entry\n mereology).\n The part relation \u2264p and the sum operation +\nare then related as usual: s \u2264p\ns\u2032 iff s + s\u2032 =\ns\u2032. Propositions are sets of possible situations or\ntheir characteristic functions (see the entry\n propositions).\n The notion of a situation that exemplifies a proposition might be\ndefined as in (29), which is a variation of a definition that appears\nin Kratzer 1990 (Other Internet Resources), 1998, 2002:\n\n(29)\nExemplification\n\nA situation s exemplifies a proposition p if\nwhenever there is a part of s in which p is not\ntrue, then s is a minimal situation in which p is\ntrue.\n\n\nIntuitively, a situation that exemplifies a proposition p is\none that does not contain anything that does not contribute to the\ntruth of p. The first part of (29) allows two possibilities\nfor a situation s to exemplify p. Either p\nis true in all subsituations of s or s is a minimal\nsituation in which p is true. The notion of minimality\nappealed to in (29) is the standard one: A situation is a minimal\nsituation in which a proposition p is true iff it has no\nproper parts in which p is true. The situation Mud (Case One\nbelow) gives a first illustration of what (29) does.\n\nCase One: Mud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMud is a situation that consists of mud and only mud. \n\n\n\nAssuming that Mud and all of its parts are mud, Mud and all of its\nparts exemplify the proposition in 30(b), since there are no parts of\nMud where there is no mud.\n\n(30)\n\n\na.\nThere is mud.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x\nmud(x)(s)\n\n\n\n30(b) is not exemplified by Mud & Moss (Case Two below),\nhowever:\n\nCase Two: Mud & Moss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMud & Moss is a situation that consists of some mud and some\nmoss and nothing else.  \n\n\nMud & Moss has parts where 30(b) is not true: the parts where\nthere is only moss. But Mud & Moss is not a minimal situation in\nwhich 30(b) is true.\n\nNext, consider (31):\n\n(31)\n\n\na.\nThere are three teapots.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s & |{y: y\n\u2264p x &\nteapot(y)(ws)}| = 3]\n \n\n\n31(b) describes situations s that have at least three teapots\n(individuals that are teapots in the world of s) in them. The\nproposition in 31(b) seems to be exemplified by the situation Teapots\n(Case Three below).\n\nCase Three: Teapots\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeapots has three teapots and nothing else in it. \n\n\n\nThere is no proper subsituation of Teapots in which 31(b) is true.\nSince Teapots has nothing but three teapots in it, any proper\nsubsituation of Teapots would have to be one where a part of at least\none of the three teapots is missing. But 31(b) is true in Teapots\nitself, and Teapots is thus a minimal situation in which 31(b) is\ntrue.\n\nThere is a potential glitch in the above piece of reasoning. It\nassumes that when an individual is a teapot in a world, no proper part\nof that individual is also a teapot in that world. This assumption can\nbe questioned, however. Following Geach 1980 (p. 215; see entries\n identity,\n problem of many), we might reason as follows: My teapot would remain a\nteapot if we chipped off a tiny piece. Chipping off pieces from\nteapots doesn\u2019t create new teapots, so there must have been\nsmaller teapots all along. We might feel that there is just a single\nteapot sitting on the table, but upon reflection we might have to\nacknowledge that there are in fact many overlapping entities that all\nhave legitimate claims to teapothood. The unexpected multitude of\nteapots is a source of headaches when it comes to counting. A\nfundamental principle of counting says that a domain for counting\ncannot contain non-identical overlapping individuals (Casati &\nVarzi 1999, 112):\n\n(32)\nCounting Principle\n\nA counting domain cannot contain non-identical overlapping\nindividuals.\n\n\n(32) implies that just one of the many overlapping teapots on the\ntable over there can be counted, and the question is which one. If we\nare that liberal with teapothood, we need a counting criterion that\ntells us which of the many teapots in our overpopulated inventory of\nteapots we are allowed to count.\n\nWith spatiotemporal objects like teapots, humans seem to rely on\ncounting criteria that privilege maximal self-connected entities\n(Spelke 1990, Casati & Varzi 1999). A self-connected teapot is one\nthat cannot be split into two parts that are not connected. In\ncontrast to parthood, which is a mereological concept, connectedness\nis a topological notion (see Casati and Varzi 1999 for discussion of\nvarious postulates for a \u201cmereotopology\u201d, a theory that\ncombines mereology and topology). The maximality requirement prevents\ncounting teapots that are proper parts of other teapots, and the\nself-connectedness requirement disqualifies sums of parts from\ndifferent teapots. Casati and Varzi point out that not all kinds of\nentities, not even all kinds of spatiotemporal entities, come with\ncounting criteria that involve topological self-connectedness. Obvious\ncounterexamples include bikinis, three-piece suits, and broken glasses\nthat are shattered all over the floor. We have to recognize a wider\nrange of counting criteria, then, that guarantee compliance with (32)\nin one way or other.\n\nAssuming counting criteria, the proposition expressed by 31(a) would\nstill be exemplified by Teapots, even if we grant that teapots can\nhave proper parts that are also teapots. The specification of\ndenotations for sentences with numerals would now have to make\nreference to teapots that can be counted, call them \u201cnumerical\nteapots\u201d. Representations like 31(b) and its kin should then be\nunderstood along the lines of 33(b):\n\n(33)\n\n\na.\nThere are three teapots.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s  & |{y:\ny \u2264p x  &\nnumerical-teapot(y)(ws)}| =\n3]\n \n\n\nIf Teapots contains nothing but three individuals that are numerical\nteapots in the actual world, 33(b) is true in Teapots. But then none\nof the proper subsituations of Teapots can contain three individuals\nthat are numerical teapots in the actual world. Any such situation\ncontains at least one teapot that is a proper part of one of the\nteapots in Teapots, hence can no longer contain three numerical\nteapots.\n\nIn contrast to Teapots, Teapots & Scissors (Case Four below) does\nnot exemplify 31(b). Teapots & Scissors has parts where 31(b) is\nnot true: take any part that has just the scissors or just a part of\nthe scissors in it, for example. But Teapots & Scissors is not a\nminimal situation in which 31(b) is true.\n\nCase Four: Teapots and Scissors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeapots & Scissors has three teapots and a pair of scissors\nand nothing else in it.  \n\n\nDefinition (29) has the consequence that Teapots does not exemplify\nthe proposition 34(b) below, even though 34(b) is true in Teapots.\n\n(34)\n\n\na.\nThere are two teapots.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s  & |{y:\ny \u2264p x  &\nteapot(y)(ws)}| = 2]\n \n\n\n34(b) is true in Teapots, since Teapots contains a plural individual\nthat contains exactly two teapots. However, 34(b) is not exemplified\nby Teapots. Teapots has parts in which 34(b) is not true without being\na minimal situation in which 34(b) is true. More generally, if\nsentences of the form there are n teapots denote propositions\nof the kind illustrated by 34(b), then those propositions can only be\nexemplified by situations that have exactly n teapots.\nLikewise, if there is a teapot is interpreted as in 35(b)\nbelow, the proposition it expresses can only be exemplified by\nsituations with exactly one teapot, even though it can be true in\nsituations with more teapots.\n\n(35)\n\n\na.\nThere is a teapot.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s  & |{y:\ny \u2264p x  &\nteapot(y)(ws)}| = 1]\n \n\n\nThe predicted exemplification properties of sentences with numerals\nare welcome, since they suggest that (29) might indeed capture the\nrelation between propositions and situations that we are after: The\nsituations exemplifying the proposition expressed by there is a\nteapot are all situations that have a single teapot in them,\nhence are literally minimal situations containing a teapot. In\ncontrast, the situations exemplifying the proposition expressed by\nthere is mud are all situations that contain mud and nothing\nelse, hence do not have to be minimal situations containing mud.\n\nThe major consequence of (29) is that if a proposition has\nexemplifying situations at all, the set of its exemplifying situations\nmust be either homogeneous or quantized in the sense of Krifka 1992. A\nset of situations is quantized iff it doesn\u2019t contain both a\nsituation s and a proper part of s. A set of\nsituations is homogeneous iff it is closed under the parthood\nrelation, that is, whenever it contains a situation s, it\nalso contains all parts of s. As argued in Krifka\u2019s\nwork, algebraic notions like homogeneity and quantization might\ncapture linguistically important aspectual distinctions like that\nillustrated in (36) (see the entry on\n tense and aspect).\n\n(36)\n\n\na.\nJosephine built an airplane.\nb.\nJosephine flew an airplane.\n \n\n\nThe proposition expressed by 36(a) seems to be exemplified by minimal\npast situations in which Josephine built an airplane, and this set of\nsituations is quantized. On the other hand, the proposition expressed\nby 36(b) seems to be exemplified by all past situations that contain\nairplane flying by Josephine and nothing else, and this set of\nsituations is homogeneous. Homogeneous sets cannot be used as counting\ndomains, however, and this requires adjustments with examples like\n37(b).\n\n(37)\n\n\na.\nJosephine built an airplane just once.\nb.\nJosephine flew an airplane just once.\n \n\n\n37(b) cannot quantify over all situations that exemplify the\nproposition Josephine flew an airplane, since this would give\nus a quantification domain that violates the Counting Principle (32).\nWe have to impose a counting criterion, then, and the topological\nnotion of self-connectedness seems to be relevant here, too (see von\nFintel 2004a,b). As a result, 37(b) might quantify over maximal\nself-connected situations exemplifying the proposition expressed by\nJosephine flew an airplane.\n\nWe are now in a position to see how exemplification can be used for\nthe analysis of donkey sentences. Look again at (38) and (39):\n\n(38)\nWhenever a man saw a donkey, the man greeted the donkey.\n(39)\nWhenever snow falls around here, it takes ten volunteers to remove\nit.\n\n\n(38) and (39) quantify over parts of a contextually salient topic\nsituation. The antecedents of the conditionals tell us more about what\nthose parts are. In (38) quantification is over situations\nexemplifying the proposition expressed by a man saw a donkey,\nwhich are all situations that contain a single man and a single\ndonkey. Those situations can then be taken to be resource situations\nfor the definite descriptions the man and the donkey\nin the consequent of (38). (39) also quantifies over parts of the\ntopic situation that exemplify the antecedent proposition, but as in\nthe case of 37(b), considering all exemplifying situations would\nviolate the Counting Principle, and we therefore need a counting\ncriterion. (39) might then quantify over maximal self-connected\nsituations exemplifying the proposition expressed by snow falls\naround here. Those situations include complete snowfalls, then,\nand if it does indeed snow a lot around here whenever it snows, (39)\nmight very well wind up true.\n\nNot all propositions that look like perfectly acceptable candidates\nfor sentence denotations have exemplifying situations. Consider 40(b),\nfor example:\n\n(40)\n\n\na.\nThere is more than five tons of mud.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [mud(x)(s)\n& fton(x) > 5]\n \n\n\nWhenever there is a situation that has more than five tons of mud in\nit, there are parts that have just five tons or less. But none of\nthose parts can be part of any minimal situation with more than five\ntons of mud, since there are no such situations.\n\nIn a situation semantics, it often happens that there are several\noptions for assigning subtly different propositions to sentences, and\nsometimes the options are hard to distinguish on truth-conditional\ngrounds. Insisting on both adequate truth-conditions and adequate\nexemplification conditions might help narrow down the field of\ncandidates. 40(a) can also be paraphrased as saying that the total\namount of mud in some contextually salient resource situation weighs\nmore than five tons. The denotation of 40(a) could be (41), then,\nwhich includes a contextualized maximalization condition:\n\n(41)\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s & [x =\n\u03c3z mud(z)(s\u2032)] &\nfton(x) > 5]\n\n\n(41) is true in a situation s if it contains all the mud of\nsome salient resource situation s\u2032 (possibly the actual\nworld as a whole), and that mud weighs more than 5 tons. (41) is\nexemplified by the mud in s\u2032, provided it weighs more\nthan five tons. Sentences may contain noun phrases that provide\nanchors for the maximalization condition. (42) is a case in\nquestion:\n\n(42)\n\n\na.\nThere is more than five tons of mud in this ditch.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [x\n\u2264p s & x =\n\u03c3z [mud(z)(ws)\n& in(this ditch)(z)(ws)]\n& fton(x) > 5]\n \n\n\n42(b) is exemplified by the mud in this ditch, as long as it weighs\nmore than five tons.\n\nMaximalized interpretations for more than n and similar kinds\nof indefinites like at least n are discussed in Reinhart\n1986, Kadmon  (1987, 1990, 2001), Schein 1993, and Landman (2000,\n2004). Some of the original observations go back to Evans 1977. As\nnoted by Reinhart and Kadmon, more than n noun phrases\nproduce maximality effects of the kind illustrated in (43):\n\n(43)\nThere was more than 5 tons of mud in this ditch. The mud was\nremoved.\n\n\n(43) would be considered false in a situation where there was in fact\n7 tons of mud in this ditch, but only six tons were removed. This\njudgment can be accounted for by assuming that utterances of the\nsecond sentence in (43) are about a particular past situation that\nexemplifies the first sentence. This situation can then serve as a\nresource situation for the interpretation of the definite description\nthe mud. If sentences like 42(a) have maximalized\ninterpretations, it follows that the mud that was removed was all the\nmud in the ditch.\n\nThere are other numeral expressions that trigger maximalization. (44)\nis an example:\n\n(44)\n\n\na.\nThere were between two and four teapots on this shelf.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x [ x\n\u2264p s & x =\n\u03c3z\n[teapots(z)(ws) & on(this\nshelf)(z)(ws)] & 2 \u2264\n|{z: teapot(z)(ws)\n& z \u2264p x }| \u2264 4]\nc.\nThere were between two and four teapots on this shelf. They were\ndefective.\n \n\n\n44(c), too, would be considered false in situations where only some of\nthe teapots on the shelf are defective. Even simple numeral phrases\nlike four teapots can have maximalized interpretations.\n\n(45)\nThere were four teapots on the shelf. They were defective.\n\n\nIntuitions for (45) are not so clear, but (46) brings out a sharp\ndifference between simple and complex numeral phrases.\n\n(46)\n\n\na.\nEvery time I sell two teapots on a single day, I am entitled to a\n$5 bonus.\nb.\nEvery time I sell more than two teapots on a single day, I am\nentitled to a $5 bonus.\nc.\nEvery time I sell between two and five teapots on a single day, I\nam entitled to a $5 bonus.\n \n\n\nImagine that I sold exactly four teapots yesterday. 46(a) has an\ninterpretation where I am entitled to a $10 bonus. On this reading,\nour quantification domain is some set of non-overlapping situations\nthat are minimal situations in which I sold two teapots on the same\nday. Regardless of how we pair up yesterday\u2019s four teapot sales\nto construct an acceptable counting domain, we always end up with\nexactly two bonus-qualifying situations. This shows that numeral\nexpressions like two teapots do not obligatorily have\nmaximalized interpretations. 46(a) contrasts with 46(b) and (c). 46(c)\nhas no interpretation where I qualify for a $10 bonus if I sold four\nteapots yesterday. And 46(b) has no interpretation where I get $10\ndollars if I sold six, for example. We can conclude, then, that\nnumeral expressions of the form more than n NP or between\nn and m NP trigger denotations that are obligatorily maximalized,\nbut this is not the case for simple numerals of the form n\nNP.\n\nReturning to the donkey sentences we looked at earlier, we now\nunderstand why 47(a) and (b) (repeated from above) do not simply\nquantify over minimal situations in a na\u00efve sense:\n\n(47)\n\n\na.\nWhen a cat eats more than one can of Super Supper in a day, it\ngets sick.\nb.\nWhenever there are between 20 and 2000 guests at a wedding, a\nsingle waiter can serve them.\n \n\n\nThe antecedents of 47(a) and (b) involve maximalization. For 47(a),\nfor example, the proposition expressed by the antecedent could be\n48(b):\n\n(48)\n\n\na.\nWhen a cat eats more than one can of Super Supper in a day\n\u2026\n\nWhen the amount of Super Supper a cat eats within a day is more than\none can \u2026\nb.\n\u03bbs \u2203x \u2203y\n[cat(x)(s) &\nfday(s) = 1 & y =\n\u03c3z\n[Super-Supper(z)(ws) &\neat(z)(x)(s)] &\nfcan(y) > 1]\n \n\n\n48(b) restricts the situations quantified over to those whose temporal\nextension is a day, which could be a calendar day, or, more plausibly,\na 24-hour period. The maximality condition can then pick out all the\nfood eaten during such a period by the relevant cats, regardless of\nwhether they ate just a little more than what comes in a can or much\nmore than that. There is no pressure to keep the portions small.\nHowever, Fox & Hackl (2006) have drawn attention to a class of\ncases where there is pressure to keep amounts small in\nsentences with more than n noun phrases. (49) below would be\nsuch a case:\n\n(49)\nWhenever the ballot count showed that a candidate had won more\nthan 50% of all votes, the winning candidate appeared on TV five\nminutes later.\n\n\n(49) suggests that candidates appeared on TV five minutes after it\nbecame clear that they had won the majority of votes. If 500 votes\nwere cast in all, for example, and the ballot count showed at 8:00 pm\nthat one of the candidates had won 251 votes, the winning candidate is\nclaimed to have appeared on TV at 8:05 pm. This judgment is expected\nif (49) quantifies over situations that exemplify the proposition\nexpressed by its antecedent. Factoring in maximalization triggered by\nmore than 50% of all votes, the antecedent can be paraphrased\nas (50):\n\n(50)\nThe ballot count showed that the number of votes won by a\ncandidate was more than 50% of all votes.\n\n\nThe exemplifying situations for the proposition expressed by (50) are\nminimal ballot count situations that establish that one of the\ncandidates has carried the majority of votes. If there are 500 ballots\nin all, the exemplifying situations are all situations where 251\nballots have been counted.\n\nThe last case to discuss concerns negative quantifiers.\n\n(51)\n\n\na.\nThere is no teapot.\nb.\n\u03bbs \u00ac\u2203x\nteapot(x)(s)\n \n\n\n51(b) is exemplified by the situations in which it is true. This makes\nthe situations exemplifying negative sentences a rather disparate\nbatch that do not resemble each other in any intuitive sense. If we\nwant to quantify over situations exemplifying the propositions\nexpressed by negative sentences, as we do in (52) below (repeated from\nabove), contextual restrictions for the topic situation must play a\nmajor role, including those contributed by the topic-focus\narticulation and presuppositions (Kratzer 1989, 2012; von Fintel 1994,\n2004a). Exemplification is not expected to make any contribution here,\nwhich is the result we want to derive.\n\n(52)\nWhenever nobody showed up, we canceled the class.\n\n\nThis section discussed and tested a particular possibilistic account\nof the relation between a proposition and its exemplifying situations.\nThe test cases were conditionals that quantify over situations that\nare \u201cminimal\u201d in a way that is responsive to specific\nproperties of their antecedents: the presence of count nouns versus\nmass nouns, telic versus atelic verb phrases, modified versus\nunmodified numerals, negative versus positive quantifiers. The account\nshowed the right responsiveness in interaction with independently\nmotivated interpretations for the sentences involved. Interestingly,\nonce possible maximalizations are factored into sentence denotations,\nthe exemplification account spelled out in definition (29) coincides\nwith the na\u00efve minimalization account in most cases. The only\nsystematic exceptions seem to be atelic antecedents, including those\ninvolving negation. Contrary to initial appearance, then, the\nna\u00efve minimalization accounts found in most existing analyses of\ndonkey sentences within a possibilistic situation semantics are close\nto correct (but see section 9 for discussion of another potentially\nproblematic case, example (61)).\n",
