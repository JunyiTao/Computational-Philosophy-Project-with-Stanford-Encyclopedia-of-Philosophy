    "main_text": "History of the Correspondence Theory || Object-Based and Fact-Based Versions\n1.2 Object-Based and Fact-Based Versions\n\n\nIt is helpful to distinguish between \u201cobject-based\u201d and\n\u201cfact-based\u201d versions of correspondence theories,\ndepending on whether the corresponding portion of reality is said to\nbe an object or a fact (cf. K\u00fcnne 2003, chap. 3).\n\n\nTraditional versions of object-based theories assumed that\nthe truth-bearing items (usually taken to be judgments) have\nsubject-predicate structure. An object-based definition of truth might\nlook like this:\nA judgment is true if and only if its predicate\ncorresponds to its object (i.e., to the object referred to by the\nsubject term of the judgment).\n\n\nNote that this actually involves two relations to an object:\n(i) a reference relation, holding between the subject term of the\njudgment and the object the judgment is about (its object);\nand (ii) a correspondence relation, holding between the predicate term\nof the judgment and a property of the object. Owing to its reliance on\nthe subject-predicate structure of truth-bearing items, the account\nsuffers from an inherent limitation: it does not cover truthbearers\nthat lack subject-predicate structure (e.g. conditionals,\ndisjunctions), and it is not clear how the account might be extended\nto cover them. The problem is obvious and serious; it was nevertheless\nsimply ignored in most writings. Object-based correspondence was the\nnorm until relatively recently.\n\n\nObject-based correspondence became the norm through Plato\u2019s\npivotal engagement with the problem of falsehood, which was\napparently notorious at its time. In a number of dialogues, Plato\ncomes up against an argument, advanced by various Sophists, to the\neffect that false judgment is impossible\u2014roughly: To judge\nfalsely is to judge what is not. But one cannot judge what is\nnot, for it is not there to be judged. To judge something that is not\nis to judge nothing, hence, not to judge at all. Therefore, false\njudgment is impossible. (Cf. Euthydemus\n283e-288a; Cratylus 429c-e; Republic\n478a-c; Theaetetus 188d-190e.) Plato has no good answer to\nthis patent absurdity until the Sophist (236d-264b), where he\nfinally confronts the issue at length. The key step in his solution is\nthe analysis of truthbearers as structured complexes. A simple\nsentence, such as \u201cTheaetetus sits.\u201d, though simple as a\nsentence, is still a complex whole consisting of words of different\nkinds\u2014a name (onoma) and a verb\n(rhema)\u2014having different functions. By weaving together\nverbs with names the speaker does not just name a number of things,\nbut accomplishes something: meaningful speech (logos)\nexpressive of the interweaving of ideas (eidon\nsymploken). The simple sentence is true when Theaetetus, the\nperson named by the name, is in the state of sitting, ascribed to him\nthrough the verb, and false, when Theaetetus is not in that state but\nin another one (cf. 261c-263d; see Denyer 1991; Szaif\n1998). Only things that are show up in this account: in the\ncase of falsehood, the ascribed state still is, but it is a state\ndifferent from the one Theaetetus is in. The account is extended from\nspeech to thought and belief via Plato\u2019s well known thesis that\n\u201cthought is speech that occurs without voice, inside the soul in\nconversation with itself\u201d (263e)\u2014the historical origin of\nthe language-of-thought hypothesis. The account does not take into\nconsideration sentences that contain a name of something that is not\n(\u201cPegasus flies\u201d), thus bequeathing to posterity a\nresidual problem that would become more notorious than the problem of\nfalsehood.\n\n\nAristotle, in De Interpretatione, adopts Plato\u2019s\naccount without much ado\u2014indeed, the beginning of De\nInterpretatione reads like a direct continuation of the passages\nfrom the Sophist mentioned above. He emphasizes that truth\nand falsehood have to do with combination and separation (cf. De\nInt. 16a10; in De Anima 430a25, he says: \u201cwhere\nthe alternative of true and false applies, there we always find a sort\nof combining of objects of thought in a quasi-unity\u201d). Unlike\nPlato, Aristotle feels the need to characterize simple affirmative and\nnegative statements (predications) separately\u2014translating rather\nmore literally than is usual: \u201cAn affirmation is a predication\nof something toward something, a negation is a predication of\nsomething away from something\u201d (De Int. 17a25). This\ncharacterization reappears early in the Prior Analytics\n(24a). It thus seems fair to say that the subject-predicate analysis\nof simple declarative sentences\u2014the most basic feature of\nAristotelian term logic which was to reign supreme for many\ncenturies\u2014had its origin in Plato\u2019s response to a\nsophistical argument against the possibility of falsehood. One may\nnote that Aristotle\u2019s famous definition of truth (see Section 1)\nactually begins with the definition of falsehood.\n\nFact-based correspondence theories became prominent only in\nthe 20th century, though one can find remarks in Aristotle that fit\nthis approach (see Section 1)\u2014somewhat surprisingly in light of\nhis repeated emphasis on subject-predicate structure wherever truth\nand falsehood are concerned. Fact-based theories do not presuppose\nthat the truth-bearing items have subject-predicate structure; indeed,\nthey can be stated without any explicit reference to the structure of\ntruth-bearing items. The approach thus embodies an alternative\nresponse to the problem of falsehood, a response that may claim to\nextricate the theory of truth from the limitations imposed on it\nthrough the presupposition of subject-predicate structure inherited\nfrom the response to the problem of falsehood favored by Plato,\nAristotle, and the medieval and modern tradition.\n\n\nThe now classical formulation of a fact-based correspondence theory\nwas foreshadowed by Hume (Treatise, 3.1.1) and Mill\n(Logic, 1.5.1). It appears in its canonical form early in the\n20th century in Moore (1910-11, chap. 15) and Russell: \u201cThus a\nbelief is true when there is a corresponding fact, and is false when\nthere is no corresponding fact\u201d (1912, p. 129; cf. also his\n1905, 1906, 1910, and 1913). The self-conscious emphasis\non facts as the corresponding portions of reality\u2014and a\nmore serious concern with problems raised by\nfalsehood\u2014distinguishes this version from its\nforeshadowings. Russell and Moore\u2019s forceful advocacy of truth\nas correspondence to a fact was, at the time, an integral part of\ntheir defense of metaphysical realism. Somewhat ironically, their\nformulations are indebted to their idealist opponents, F. H. Bradley\n(1883, chaps. 1&2), and H. H. Joachim (1906), the latter was an\nearly advocate of the competing coherence theory, who had set up a\ncorrespondence-to-fact account of truth as the main target of his\nattack on realism. Later, Wittgenstein (1921) and Russell (1918)\ndeveloped \u201clogical atomism\u201d, which introduces an important\nmodification of the fact-based correspondence approach (see below,\nSection 7.1). Further modifications of the correspondence theory,\nbringing a return to more overtly semantic and broadly object-based\nversions, were influenced by Tarski\u2019s (1935) technical work on\ntruth (cf. Field 1972, Popper 1972).\n",
