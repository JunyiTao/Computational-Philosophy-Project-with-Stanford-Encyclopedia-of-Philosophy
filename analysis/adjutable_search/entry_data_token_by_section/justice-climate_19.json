Climate Justice in a Nonideal World\n\nThe preceding sections have discussed different questions of justice\nthat arise when considering how to respond to climate change, and they\nhave explored different answers that can be given. One persistent\nfeature of global and domestic climate policies is that there has been\na high level of noncompliance with principles of climate justice.\nGiven this, it is appropriate to ask: \u201cWhat principles of\njustice should apply in the context of noncompliance?\u201d\n\nDifferent responses have been given. To locate them it may be helpful\nto set out the possibilities (Caney 2016).\n\nOne response might be \u201cduty-reallocation\u201d.\nThat is, one might propose a solution in which some bear some of the\nresponsibilities that should, ideally, be borne by others.\nA second response might be to relax the moral\nconstraints on mitigation policies, the aim being to make it more\nlikely that non-complying agents will discharge their duties to\nmitigate.\nA third (related) response might be to adopt other\nextreme responses that one might think are normally unacceptable but\npermissible in an emergency.\nA fourth response might be to take a more proactive\nstance and seek to tackle the underlying structures which lead to\nnoncompliance (for example, by designing institutions which reduce\nsuch noncompliance and undermining organisations which are thwarting\nsuccessful climate action).\nA fifth response might be \u201ctarget\nmodification\u201d. That is, one might lower one\u2019s ambition, so\nwhereas one might think that justice ideally requires a 1.5\u00b0C\ntarget one might accept a less ambitious target.\n\n\nA number of philosophers have argued for a\n type (1)-like response.\n One version maintains that some (the advantaged) should take on more\nthan their fair share of responsibilities. A second version is defended by Broome. He\nargues that current generations ought to reduce their emissions to\ntackle climate change and that they ought to absorb the costs of doing\nso. However, he also thinks that implementing an effective climate\ntreaty is of paramount significance and that parties will not agree to\none if they have to pay. In light of this he suggests that they should\nmitigate but pass on the costs to future generations (Broome 2012:\n47\u201348). Broome thinks this involves an unjust distribution of\ncosts but that it is nonetheless, all things considered, justified\nbecause it helps prevent dangerous climate change. Broome\u2019s\nsolution involves some (current people) making\nothers (future people) bear an unjust burden. A third related\nposition is defended by Eric Posner and David Weisbach (2010). They\nargue that a climate treaty is imperative but will not be feasible\nunless it leaves signatories to the climate treaty no worse off. They\nassume that the benefits from such a treaty will be such that there is\na \u201csurplus\u201d and so no one need be worse off. However, if\nthis assumption does not hold then their commitment to leaving high\nemitters no worse off might also entail that others bear an unjust\nburden (making it a\n type (1) response).\n As they recognise, even if there is a surplus some powerful states\nmay agree to a treaty only if they receive such extensive compensation\nthat it leaves others with more than their fair share of\nresponsibilities or burdens (Posner and Weisbach 2010: 181). \n\nConsider now\n (2):\n some might think that normally one should not convert a place of\ngreat natural beauty into giant fields of solar panels, but they might\nalso think that, in dire circumstances, this prohibition can be\noverturned. If we now consider\n (3):\n many would see geoengineering as a version of this kind of response.\nAnd if we turn to\n (4):\n This is a corollary of some of the views discussed in\n Section 5.3,\n which generally held that agents have political responsibilities to\ncreate just and effective institutions and responsibilities to combat\nongoing campaigns to thwart effective climate action.\n\nWhat response (or combination of responses) one thinks to be the least\nbad here will depend on one\u2019s overall theory of justice.\nSufficientarians, for example, may think that the affluent\u2014those\nabove the specified sufficiency threshold\u2014should take on more\nthan their fair share of burdens, but will reject the idea that any of the world\u2019s\npoorest should be required to adopt\n response (1)\n (unless perhaps it is absolutely necessary for very large numbers of future people to\nenjoy what they are entitled to).\n",
