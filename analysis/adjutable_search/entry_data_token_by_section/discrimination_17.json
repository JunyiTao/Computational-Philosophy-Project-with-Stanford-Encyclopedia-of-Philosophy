    "main_text": "Religious Liberty and Antidiscrimination Laws\n9. Conclusion\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination provides a way of thinking about a\ncertain kind of wrong that can be found in virtually every society and\nera. The wrong involves a group-based structure that works in\ncombination with relative deprivations built around the structure. The\ndeprivations are wrongful because they treat persons as having a\ndegraded moral status, but also because the deprivations tend to make\nmembers of the group in question vulnerable to domination and\noppression at the hands of those who occupy positions of relative\nadvantage. It is true that there has been confusion attending the\nconcept of discrimination, and there will long be debates about the\nbest way to understand and apply it. However, the concept has proved\nto be a useful one for representing in thought and combating in action\na kind of wrong that is deeply entrenched in human social\nrelations.\n",
