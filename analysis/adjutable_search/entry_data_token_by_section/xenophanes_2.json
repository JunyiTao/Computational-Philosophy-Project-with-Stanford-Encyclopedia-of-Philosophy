    "main_text": "The Nature of the Divine\n3. The Nature of the Divine\n\nSo far as is known, Xenophanes was the first Greek thinker to offer a\ncomplex and at least partially systematic account of the divine\nnature. We have already noted how an implicit assumption of divine\nperfection may underlie his criticisms of Homer, Hesiod, and the\ntendency to imagine the gods in human form. Of the positive\ncharacterizations of the divine made in B23\u201326, perhaps the most\nfundamental is B23:\n\nOne god greatest among gods and men,\n\nnot at all like mortals in body or in thought.\n\n\nAlthough the remark has often been read as a pioneering expression of\nmonotheism, this reading is made problematic by the nearby reference\nto \u2018gods\u2019 in the plural in the first line and the\npossibility that Xenophanes sought to highlight not the one\ngod but rather the one greatest god (cf. Homer,\nIliad 12, 243 for the use of \u2018one\u2019 (Greek\nheis) reinforcing a superlative). The relevant measures of\ndivine \u2018greatness\u2019 are not specified, but the two most\nobvious choices would be greatness in honor and power, with honor\nperhaps the more basic of the two (cf. Iliad 2, 350; 2, 412;\n4, 515; Od. 3, 378; 5,4; Hesiod, Theogony 49, 534,\n538, etc.). Greatness in power would in turn explain the\ncharacterizations of the divine as perceptive and conscious in all its\nparts (B24), able to shake all things by the exercise of his thought\n(B25), and able to accomplish everything while remaining forever in\nthe same place or condition (B26). It is unclear, however, how far\nXenophanes himself realized the interconnections among the different\ndivine attributes or sought to exploit those connections for didactic\npurposes. At least as they have come down to us, none of the remarks\non the divine nature (B23\u201326) contains any of the inferential\nparticles (gar, epei, oun, hoti, etc.) one would normally\nexpect to find in a piece of reasoned discourse.\n\nSome later writers (A28.6, 31.2, 34\u201336) report that Xenophanes\nidentified his \u2018one greatest god\u2019 with the entire physical\nuniverse\u2014often termed \u2018the whole\u2019 or \u2018all\nthings\u2019, and some modern accounts portray Xenophanes as a\npantheist. But this understanding of Xenophanes\u2019 doctrines seems\ninconsistent with his assertion that \u201cgod shakes all\nthings\u201d (B25) that \u201call things are from the earth and to\nthe earth all things come in the end\u201d (B27), and that \u201call\nthings which come into being and grow, are earth and water\u201d\n(B29). On the whole, Xenophanes\u2019 remarks on the divine nature\nare perhaps best read as an expression of a traditional Greek piety:\nthere exists a being of extraordinary power and excellence, and it is\nincumbent on each of us to hold it in high regard.\n",
