    "main_text": "Fazang (643\u2013712) || Analysis of One Mind\n4.2 Analysis of One Mind\n\nIn his Commentary on Awakening of Faith in Mahayana (Ch.\nDasheng qixin lun yiji; T44.1846, trans. Vorenkamp 2004a),\nFazang identifies One Mind with tathagatagarbha.\nTathagatagarbha, as Fazang understands it, is neither an\nindividual consciousness nor something that stands apart from or\nopposed to matter. It is, instead, the one and only source of all that\nexists, creating and sustaining the dharma-realm of dependent\narising\u2014albeit without separation from that realm. One Mind, for\nFazang, is reality prior to any individual consciousness and prior to\nthe objects of consciousness (whether mental or material). This\npriority is ontological, tracking the order with respect to which\nreality is structured into more or less fundamental components. \n\nFazang posits that One Mind has two aspects, Suchness Mind and Samsara\nMind. Suchness Mind is free from discerning cognition, neither\nproduced nor destroyed. It witnesses that which is neither\n\u201cthis\u201d nor \u201cthat\u201d and yet is also not empty.\nSamsara Mind, by contrast, arises and ceases in accordance with\nconditions, transforming into purity and impurity. \n\nFazang explains the relation between these two aspects of One Mind by\npositing a distinction between Suchness and Ignorance. Suchness is the\ntrue nature of reality. Fazang posits that Suchness has two aspects,\none unchanging, the other accompanying change. Suchness as unchanging\nis calm and quiescent. Suchness as accompanying change, by contrast,\nis dynamic, embedded within the ebb and flow of conditioned\ndharmas. Because Suchness is available for encounter only to\nwitnessing consciousness that lacks a sense of self, Fazang\ncharacterizes it as empty. Ignorance, by contrast, is that which\ninitiates dukkha. Fazang posits that it, too, has two\naspects. As empty, Ignorance renders its results illusory. As actively\nfunctioning and completing affairs, it perfumes conditioned\ndharmas with hindrances and defilements. Because it is\nresponsible for the appearance of illusory objects, Fazang\ncharacterizes this aspect as existing. \n\nSuchness and Ignorance, on Fazang\u2019s account, are the two\nfundamental aspects of One Mind. The aspects of Suchness as unchanging\nand Ignorance as empty correspond to Suchness Mind. This\ncorrespondence positions Suchness Mind as the witnessing of\nunconditioned dharmas. Similarly, the aspects of Suchness as\naccompanying change and Ignorance as actively functioning correspond\nto Samsara Mind. This correspondence positions Samsara Mind as the\nwitnessing of conditioned dharmas. (Fazang provides an\nelaborate analysis of Samsara Mind, inspired by the \n Yijing\n[Classic of Changes]. The gist of his analysis explains that,\nbecause Suchness is present to Samsara Mind, right practice for the\ncessation of dukkha involves attending to the Suchness aspect\nof conditioned dharmas rather than causing those\ndharmas to cease.) \n",
