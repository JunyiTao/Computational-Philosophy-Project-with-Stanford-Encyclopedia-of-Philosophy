    "main_text": "Quantum Mechanics as a Probability Calculus\n1. Quantum Mechanics as a Probability Calculus\n\nIt is uncontroversial (though remarkable) that the formal apparatus of\nquantum mechanics reduces neatly to a generalization of classical\nprobability in which the role played by a Boolean algebra of events in\nthe latter is taken over by the \u201cquantum logic\u201d of\nprojection operators on a Hilbert\n space.[1]\n Moreover, the usual statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics\nasks us to take this generalized quantum probability theory quite\nliterally\u2014that is, not as merely a formal analogue of its\nclassical counterpart, but as a genuine doctrine of chances. In this\nsection, I survey this quantum probability theory and its supporting\nquantum\n logic.[2]\n\n[For further background on Hilbert spaces, see the entry on\n quantum mechanics.\n For further background on ordered sets and lattices, see the\nsupplementary document:\n The Basic Theory of Ordering Relations.\n Concepts and results explained these supplements will be used freely\nin what follows.] \n",
