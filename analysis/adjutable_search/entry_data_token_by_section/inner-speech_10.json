    "main_text": "Inner Speech and Pragmatics || Inner Speech and Speech Acts\n4.1 Inner Speech and Speech Acts\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n the intuition that we can perform speech acts in inner speech is the\nbasis of an argument that inner speech is a kind of speech. There are\ndifferent ways, however, that we might understand the claim, depending\non how one thinks of speech acts.\n\nOn the traditional analysis of Austin (1962) and Searle (1969),\nperforming a speech act is inherently something one does in accordance\nwith conventions tacitly understood by both speaker and listener. For\nexample, for Searle, asserting p involves (approximately)\nundertaking to someone that p is true, where the speaker does\nnot know that the listener already knows that p is true. The\nreason that an assertion can be effective is precisely that both\nspeaker and hearer understand that this is the nature of the\ntransaction. It is hard to see how this kind of analysis could apply\nto inner speech. One would need to explain how one individual can have\ntwo distinct roles, as speaker and listener, such that the conventions\nthat make interpersonal language-use possible can have any relevance\n(see Gregory 2017, 2020a for related discussion).\n\nNot every version of speech act theory, however, emphasizes\nconventions. Drawing on some ideas from Strawson (1964) and Bach &\nHarnish (1970), though not adopting their theories in whole, Wilkinson\n(2020) holds that what is essential to speech acts is that they\nexpress particular mental states. An assertion, for example, is simply\nan utterance which expresses a belief; a question is an utterance\nwhich expresses a desire to acquire certain information; etc. On this\nview, understanding someone else\u2019s utterance is simply a matter\nof grasping its content and knowing what kind of mental state the\nrelevant type of utterance expresses. Setting aside the question of\nwhether one needs to interpret their own inner speech, it may be that\ninner speech episodes can be speech acts if one thinks of speech acts\nmerely as expressions of particular mental states, rather than as\nactions which depend on conventions in the way that Austin and Searle\nsuggest. For another analysis of inner speech in terms of speech act\ntheory, see Geurts (2018), who emphasizes that inner speech episodes\ncan operate to generate commitments in a way characteristic of speech\nacts; see also Frankish (2018) and Fern\u00e1ndez Castro (2019).\n\nAn issue which sits just behind the question of whether inner speech\nepisodes are speech acts is whether they are actions at all. Gregory\n(2020b) argues that, in the vast majority of cases, inner speech\nepisodes are not actions, because we cannot give reasons for them\n(which is the criterion for actionhood on Davidson\u2019s (1963)\ncausal theory); they are not subject to our control (the criterion on\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s [1978] guidance theory); and we do not try to\nproduce them (the criterion on O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s [1973]\ntheory and Hornsby\u2019s [1980] theory). If inner speech episodes\nare not actions, then they cannot be speech acts.\n\nTom Frankfort (2022) takes the opposite view. He observes that a great\ndeal of inner speech is involved in deliberation, where this is an\nexpansive category including \u201creflecting, reasoning,\nconsidering, evaluating\u201d (2022: 52). He then applies\nMele\u2019s (2009) distinction between actions which involve\n\u201ctrying to bring it about that one x-s\u201d (Mele\n2009: 18) and actions which are done in order to bring it about that\none x\u2019s. Frankfort suggests that deliberating is an\naction in the first sense, insofar as it involves (for example) trying\nto make a decision, and inner speech episodes are actions in the\nsecond sense, insofar as they are produced in order to bring it about\nthat one deliberates successfully and (for example) comes to a\ndecision.\n\nJorba (forthcoming) also holds that inner speech episodes are\ntypically actions, applying affordance theory. Affordances are\nopportunities for actions suggested by things in one\u2019s\nenvironment. For example, an apple has the affordance of being edible;\na cup has the affordance of being graspable. Some hold that\naffordances can also be things which suggest mental actions\n(Jorba cites McClelland 2020 and Jorba 2020). Jorba\u2019s suggestion\nis that some mental states afford the production of inner speech\nepisodes. For example, an inchoate thought affords being articulated\nclearly in inner speech, and an emotion can afford being labeled.\nInsofar as inner speech episodes are produced in response to\naffordances, they are actions and, specifically, speech acts. See\nBar-On & Ochs (2018) for another account on which inner speech\nepisodes can be \u201cacts of innerly speaking our mind\u201d (2018:\n19, emphasis removed).\n",
