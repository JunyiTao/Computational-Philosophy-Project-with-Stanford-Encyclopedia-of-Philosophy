Theory Fictions: Baudrillard in the Contemporary Moment\n\n\nBaudrillard develops what he terms \u201ctheory fiction,\u201d or\nwhat he also calls \u201csimulation theory\u201d and\n\u201canticipatory theory.\u201d Such \u201ctheory\u201d intends to\nsimulate, grasp, and anticipate historical events, that he believes are\ncontinually outstripping all contemporary theory. The current\nsituation, he claims, is more fantastic than the most fanciful science\nfiction, or theoretical projections of a futurist society. Thus, theory\ncan only attempt to grasp the present on the run and try to anticipate\nthe future. However, he has had a mixed record as a social and\npolitical analyst and forecaster. As a political analyst, he has often\nbeen superficial and off the mark. In an essay \u201cAnorexic\nRuins\u201d published in 1989, he read the Berlin wall as a sign of a\nfrozen history, of an anorexic history, in which nothing more can\nhappen, marked by a \u201clack of events\u201d and the end of\nhistory, taking the Berlin wall as a sign of a stasis between communism\nand capitalism. Shortly thereafter, rather significant events destroyed\nthe wall that Baudrillard took as permanent and opened up a new\nhistorical era.\n\n\nThe Cold War stalemate was long taken by Baudrillard as establishing\na frozen history in which no significant change could take place.\nAlready in his mid-1970s reflections, he presented the Vietnam war as\nan \u201calibi\u201d to incorporate China, Russia, and eventually\nVietnam into a more rationalized and modernized world economic and\npolitical order (Baudrillard 1983a: 66f), and in his book on the Gulf\nwar he repeats this claim (1995: 85), thus failing to see the actual\npolitical stakes and reasons for the Vietnam war, as well as the\nsignificance of the struggles between capitalist and\ncommunist\n blocs.[12]\n\n\nFor Baudrillard, the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New\nYork also symbolized the frozen history and stasis between the two\nsystems of capitalism and communism. On the whole, he sees history as\nthe unfolding of expanding technological rationality turning into its\nopposite, as the system incorporates ever more elements, producing an\nimproved technological order, which then becomes irrational through its\nexcesses, its illusions, and its generating unforeseen consequences.\nThis mode of highly abstract analysis, however, occludes more specific\nhistorical determinants that would analyze how technological\nrationality is constructed and functioned and how and why it misfires.\nIt also covers over the disorder and turmoil created by such things as\nthe crises and restructuring of global capitalism, the rise of\nfundamentalism, ethnic conflict, and global terrorism which were\nunleashed in part as a response to a globalized rationalization of the\nmarket system and to the breakup of the bipolar world order.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s reflections on the Gulf war take a similar\nposition, seeing it as an attempt of the New World Order to further\nrationalize the world, arguing that the Gulf war really served to bring\nIslam into the New World Order (1995: 19). The first study titled\n\u201cThe Gulf war will not take place\u201d was initially published\na few days before the actual outbreak of military hostilities and\nrepeats his earlier concept of \u201cweak events\u201d and frozen\nhistory. Baudrillard to the contrary, the Gulf war took place, but this\ndid not deter him from publishing studies claiming during the episode\nthat it was not \u201creally taking place\u201d and after the war\nasserting that it \u201cdid not take place\u201d \u2014 arguing that\nit was a media spectacle and not a genuine war. Baudrillard does not\nhelp us to understand much about the event and does not even help us to\ngrasp the role of the media in contemporary political spectacles.\nReducing complex events like wars to categories like simulation or\nhyperreality illuminates the virtual and high-tech dimension to media\nevents, but erases all their concrete determinants. And yet\nBaudrillardian postmodern categories help grasp some of the dynamics of\nthe culture of living in media and computer worlds where people seem to\nenjoy immersing themselves in simulated events (witness the fascination\nof the Gulf war in 1991, the O.J. Simpson trials during 1994\u20136, the\nClinton sex scandals, and various other media spectacles throughout the\n1990s, and the September 11 terror attacks in the early days of the\nthird\n millennium).[13]\n\n\nIn The End of the Illusion (1994b), Baudrillard attacks\nhead-on what he sees as current illusions of history, politics, and\nmetaphysics, and gamely tries to explain away his own political\nmisprognoses that contemporary history appeared in a frozen, glacial\nstate, stalemated between East and West, that the system of deterrence\nhad congealed, making sure that nothing dramatic could henceforth\nhappen, that the Gulf war couldn\u2019t take place, and that the end\nof history had occurred. Baudrillard unleashes his full bag of\nrhetorical tricks and philosophical analysis to attempt to maintain\nthese hypotheses in the face of the dramatic events of 1989\u20131991, which\nhe claims are in fact \u201cweak events,\u201d that events are still\non strike, that history has indeed\n disappeared.[14]\nHe continues to argue that modernity as a\nhistorical epoch is over, with its political conflicts and upheavals,\nits innovations and revolutions, its autonomous and creative subject,\nand its myths of progress, democracy, Enlightenment, and the like.\nThese myths, these strong ideas, are exhausted, he claims, and\nhenceforth a postmodern era of banal eclecticism, inertial implosion,\nand eternal recycling of the same become defining features.\n\n\nFor Baudrillard by the end of the 1990s with the collapse of\ncommunism, the era of the strong ideas, of a conflicted world of\nrevolution and universal emancipation, is over. Communism, on his\nreading, collapsed of its own inertia, it self-destructed from within,\nit imploded, rather than perishing in ideological battle or military\nwarfare. With the absorption of its dissidents into power, there is no\nlonger a clash of strong ideas, of opposition and resistance, of\ncritical transcendence. With the embedding of the former communist\nregimes into the system of the capitalist world market and liberal\ndemocracy, the West no longer has an Other to battle against, there is\nno longer any creative or ideological tension, no longer any global\nalternative to the Western world.\n\n\nBaudrillard celebrated the coming of the new millennium with a\nrecycling of some his old ideas on cloning, the end of history, and the\ndisappearance of the real in a series of lectures collected as The\nVital Illusion (2000). For Baudrillard (2000), cloning is\nconnected to the fantasy of immortality, to defeating the life-cycle.\nThus, it is no surprise that cryogenics \u2014 the freezing of dead\nhuman beings in the hope they might be regenerated in the future\nthrough medical advances \u2014 is a booming global industry.\nLikewise, in a digital era, he claims that history has come to an end\nand reality has been killed by virtualization, as the human species\nprepares itself for a virtual existence. Baudrillard complained that\nthe contemporary era was one of weak events, that no major historical\noccurrences had happened, and that therefore life and thought were\nbecoming increasingly boring.\n\n\nShortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Baudrillard wrote\na paper \u201cL\u2019esprit du terrorisme\u201d published November\n2, 2001, in Le Monde. He argued that the assaults on the World\nTrade Center and Pentagon constituted a \u201cstrong event,\u201d\nthat the attacks were \u201cthe ultimate event, the mother of all\nevents, the pure event uniting within itself all the events that have\nnever taken place.\u201d The \u201cevent strike,\u201d Baudrillard\ndeclared, was over and since this time he has continued to focus\nintensely on the dynamics and happenings of contemporary history.\n\n\nHence, Baudrillard\u2019s thought was reignited by 9/11 and the\nsubsequent Terror War which demonstrate the continuing relevance of\nsome of his key categories and that produced some of his most\nprovocative later work. He had long written on terrorism and was\nfocusing reflection on globalization when the 9/11 attacks occurred. He\nquickly responded with the Le Monde article, soon after\ntranslated and expanded into one of the more challenging and\ncontroversial books on the terror spectacle, The Spirit of\nTerrorism: And Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002a). For\nBaudrillard, the 9/11 attacks represent a new kind of terrorism,\nexhibiting a \u201cform of action which plays the game, and lays hold\nof the rules of the game, solely with the aim of disrupting it\u2026\nthey have taken over all the weapons of the dominant\npower\u201d. That is, the terrorists in Baudrillard\u2019s\nreading used airplanes, computer networks, and the media associated\nwith Western societies to produce a spectacle of terror. The attacks\nevoked a global specter of terror that the very system of globalization\nand Western capitalism and culture were under assault by \u201cthe\nspirit of terrorism\u201d and potential terrorist attacks anytime and\nanywhere.\n\n\nFor Baudrillard, \u201cthe speeches and commentaries made since\nSeptember 11 betray a gigantic post-traumatic abreaction both to the\nevent itself and to the fascination that it exerts. The moral\ncondemnation and the sacred union against terrorism are directly\nproportional to the prodigious jubilation felt at having seen this\nglobal superpower destroyed.\u201d Baudrillard perceived that the\nterrorists hope that the system will overreact in response to the\nmultiple challenges of terrorism: \u201cIt is the terrorist model to\nbring about an excess of reality, and have the system collapse beneath\nthat excess\u201d.\n\n\nIn Baudrillard\u2019s view, the 9/11 attacks represented \u201cthe\nclash of triumphant globalization at war with itself\u201d and\nunfolded a \u201cfourth world war\u201d: \u201cThe first put an end\nto European supremacy and to the era of colonialism; the second put an\nend to Nazism; and the third to Communism. Each one brought us\nprogressively closer to the single world order of today, which is now\nnearing its end, everywhere opposed, everywhere grappling with hostile\nforces. This is a war of fractal complexity, waged worldwide against\nrebellious singularities that, in the manner of antibodies, mount a\nresistance in every cell.\u201d (Sokal and Bricmont (1998) have\ncriticized Baudrillard for such metaphoric use of scientific\nterminology.)\n\n\nUpon the initial publication of his response in French newspapers\nand its immediate translation into English and other languages,\nBaudrillard himself was accused of justifying terrorism when he stated\nin the article in Le Monde: \u201cBecause it was this\ninsufferable superpower [i.e., the US] that gave rise both to the\nviolence now spreading throughout the world and to the terrorist\nimagination that (without our knowing it) dwells within us all. That\nthe entire world without exception had dreamed of this event, that\nnobody could help but dream of the destruction of so powerful a Hegemon\n\u2014 this fact is unacceptable to the moral conscience of the West.\nAnd yet it\u2019s a fact nevertheless, a fact that resists the\nemotional violence of all the rhetoric conspiring to cover it up. In\nthe end, it was they who did it, but we who wished\n it.\u201d[15]\n\n\nBaudrillard defended himself from accusations that such reflections\nconstituted a virulent anti-Americanism or legitimation of terrorism,\nclaiming: \u201cI do not praise murderous attacks \u2014 that would\nbe idiotic. Terrorism is not a contemporary form of revolution against\noppression and capitalism. No ideology, no struggle for an objective,\nnot even Islamic fundamentalism, can explain it. \u2026I have\nglorified nothing, accused nobody, justified nothing. One should not\nconfuse the messenger with his message. I have endeavored to analyze\nthe process through which the unbounded expansion of globalization\ncreates the conditions for its own\n destruction\u201d.[16]\n\n\nIndeed, Baudrillard has also produced some provocative reflections\non globalization. In \u201cThe Violence of the Global,\u201d he\ndistinguishes between the global and the universal, linking\nglobalization with technology, the market, tourism, and information\ncontrasted to identification of the universal with \u201chuman rights,\nliberty, culture, and\n democracy.\u201d[17]\nWhile \u201cglobalization appears to be\nirreversible, \u2026 universalization is likely to be on its way\nout.\u201d Elsewhere, Baudrillard writes: \u201c\u2026the idea of\nfreedom, a new and recent idea, is already fading from the minds and\nmores, and liberal globalization is coming about in precisely the\nopposite form \u2014 a police-state globalization, a total control, a\nterror based on \u2018law-and-order\u2019 measures. Deregulation ends\nup in a maximum of constraints and restrictions, akin to those of a\nfundamentalist\n society.\u201d[18]\n\n\nMany see globalization as a matrix of market economy, democracy,\ntechnology, migration and tourism, and the worldwide circulation of\nideas and culture. Baudrillard, curiously, takes the position of those\nin the anti-globalization movement who condemn globalization as the\nopposite of democracy and human rights. For him, globalization is\nfundamentally a process of homogenization and standardization that\ncrushes \u201cthe singular\u201d and heterogeneity. This position,\nhowever, fails to note the contradictions that globalization\nsimultaneously produces homogenization and hybridization and\ndifference, and that the anti-corporate globalization movement is\nfighting for social justice, democratization, and increased rights,\nfactors that Baudrillard links with a dying universalization. In fact,\nthe struggle for rights and justice is an important part of\nglobalization and Baudrillard\u2019s presenting of human rights,\ndemocratization, and justice as part of an obsolete universalization\nbeing erased by globalization is theoretically and\npolitically\n problematical.[19]\n\n\nBefore 9/11, Baudrillard saw globalization and technological\ndevelopment producing standardization and virtualization that was\nerasing individuality, social struggle, critique and reality itself as\nmore and more people became absorbed in the hyper and virtual realities\nof media and cyberspace and virtual culture. This disappearance of\nreality constituted the \u201cperfect crime\u201d which is the\nsubject of a book of that title (1996b) and elaborated in The Vital\nIllusion (2000). Baudrillard presents himself here as a detective\nsearching for the perpetrator of the \u201cperfect crime,\u201d the\nmurder of reality, \u201cthe most important event of modern\nhistory.\u201d His recurrent theme is the destruction and\ndisappearance of the real in the realm of information and simulacra,\nand the subsequent reign of illusion and appearance. In a Nietzschean\nmode, he suggests that henceforth truth and reality are illusions, that\nillusions reign, and that therefore people should respect illusion and\nappearance and give up the illusory quest for truth and reality.\n\n\nYet in the 9/11 attacks and subsequent Terror War, difference and\nconflict have erupted upon the global stage and heterogeneous forces\nthat global capitalism appears unable to absorb and assimilate have\nemerged that have produced what appears to be an era of intense\nconflict. Ideological apologists of globalization such as Thomas\nFriedman have been forced to acknowledge that globalization has its\ndark sides and produces conflict as well as networking, interrelations,\nand progress. It remains to be seen, of course, how the current Terror\nWar and intensified global conflicts will be resolved.\n",
