    "main_text": "The SR Model || The SR Model and Low Probability Events\n3.2 The SR Model and Low Probability Events\n\nThe SR model has a number of distinctive features that have\ngenerated substantial discussion. First, note that according to the\nSR model, and in contrast to the DN/IS model, an\nexplanation is not an argument\u2014either in the sense of a\ndeductively valid argument in which the explanandum follows as a\nconclusion from the explanans or in the sense of a so-called inductive\nargument in which the explanandum follows with high probability from\nthe explanans, as in the case of IS explanation. Instead, an\nexplanation is an assembly of information that is statistically\nrelevant to an explanandum. Salmon argues (and takes the birth control\nexample\n (5)\n to illustrate) that the criteria that a good argument must satisfy\n(e.g., criteria that insure deductive soundness or some inductive\nanalogue) are simply different from those a good explanation must\nsatisfy. Among other things, as Salmon puts it, \u201cirrelevancies\n[are] harmless in arguments but fatal in explanations\u201d (1989:\n102). As explained above, in associating successful explanation with\nthe provision of information about statistical relevance\nrelationships, the SR model attempts to accommodate this\nobservation.\n\nA second, closely related point is that the SR model departs\nfrom the IS model in abandoning the idea that a statistical\nexplanation of an outcome must provide information from which it\nfollows the outcome occurred with high probability. As the reader may\ncheck, the statement of the SR model above imposes no such\nhigh probability requirement; instead, even very unlikely outcomes\nwill be explained as long as the criteria for SR explanation\nare met. Suppose that, in the above example, the probability of quick\nrecovery from strep, given treatment and the presence of a\nnon-resistant strain, is rather low (e.g., 0.2). Nonetheless, if the\ncriteria (i)\u2013(iii) above\u2014a homogeneous partition with\ncorrect probability values for each cell in the partition\u2014are\nsatisfied, we may use this information to explain why x, who\nhad a non-resistant strain of strep and was treated, recovered\nquickly. Indeed, according to the SR model, we may explain\nwhy some x which is A is B, even if the\nconditional probability of B given A and the cell\n\\(C_i\\) to which x belongs \\((p_i = P(B\\pmid A.C_i))\\) is\nless than the prior probability \\((p = P(B\\pmid A))\\) of\nB in A. For example, if the prior probability of quick\nrecovery among all those with any form of strep is 0.5 and the\nprobability of quick recovery of those with a resistant strain who are\nuntreated is 0.1, we may nonetheless explain why y, who meets\nthese last conditions \\(({-T}.R),\\) recovered quickly (assuming he\ndid) by citing the cell to which he belongs, the probability of\nrecovery given that he falls in this cell, and the other sort of\ninformation described above. More generally, what matters on the\nSR model is not whether the value of the probability of the\nexplanandum-outcome is high or low (or even high or low in comparison\nwith its prior probability) but rather whether the putative explanans\ncites all and only statistically relevant factors and whether the\nprobabilities it invokes are correct. One consequence of this, which\nSalmon endorses while acknowledging that many will regard it as\nunintuitive, is that on the SR model, the same explanans\nE may explain both an explanandum M and explananda that\nare inconsistent with M, such as \\(-M\\). For example, the same\nexplanans will explain both why a subject with strep and certain other\nproperties (e.g., T and \\(-R\\)) recovers quickly, if he does,\nand also why he does not recover if he does not. By contrast, on the\nDN or IS models, if E explains M,\nE cannot also explain \\(-M\\).\n\nThis judgment that, contrary to the IS model, the value that\na candidate explanans assigns to an explanandum-outcome should not\nmatter for the goodness of the explanation, is motivated as follows:\nWhen an outcome is the result of a genuinely indeterministic process\nwe understand both high probability and low probability outcomes (the\nlatter of which of course will sometimes occur) equally well: in both\ncases, once an SR model has been constructed, there are no additional\nfactors that distinguish the two outcomes.\n",
