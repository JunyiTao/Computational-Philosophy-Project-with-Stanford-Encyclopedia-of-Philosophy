    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || Epistemic norms\n4.5 Epistemic norms\n\nA different approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the value\nbase of science, was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton ([1942]\n1973). According to Merton, science is characterized by an\n\u201cethos\u201d, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized as four sets\nof institutional imperatives. The first of these,\nuniversalism, asserts that whatever their origins, truth\nclaims should be subjected to preestablished, impersonal criteria.\nThis implies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not\ndepend on the personal or social qualities of their protagonists.\n\nThe second imperative, communism, says that the substantive\nfindings of science are the products of social collaboration and\ntherefore belong to the community, rather than being owned by\nindividuals or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible\nwith patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and\ndiscoverers. The term \u201ccommunism\u201d is somewhat\ninfelicitous; \u201ccommunality\u201d probably captures better what\nMerton aimed at.\n\nHis third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a pattern of\ninstitutional control that is intended to curb the effects of personal\nor ideological motives that individual scientists may have. The fourth\nimperative, organized scepticism, implies that science allows\ndetached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by other\ninstitutions. This is what sometimes brings science into conflicts\nwith religions and ideologies.\n\nMerton described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of\nscience, and thus as empirical statements about norms in actual\nscience rather than normative statements about how science\nshould be conducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria\nhave often been dismissed by sociologists as oversimplified, and they\nhave only had limited influence in philosophical discussions on the\ndemarcation issue (Dolby 1987; Ruse 2000). Their potential in the\nlatter context does not seem to have been sufficiently explored.\n",
