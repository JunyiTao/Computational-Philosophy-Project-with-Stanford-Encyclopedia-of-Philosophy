    "main_text": "Origins of Daoist Religion || Huang-Lao Daoism\n2.4 Huang-Lao Daoism\n\nWith regard to Daoism per se, Huang-Lao dao (Way of\nthe Yellow Emperor and Laozi) is the name under which one part of the\ntradition was known in the early Han period (2nd century\nBCE). The precise contours of this \u201cWay\u201d are unclear, but\nit may be equivalent to the early meaning of the term Daojia\n(\u201clineage(s) of the Dao\u201d) as defined by Sima Tan (fl. ca.\n135 BCE) in the Shiji (Records of the Historian; see Roth and\nQueen 2000). The Huang-Lao adepts saw Laozi as the master who set\nforth the principles of government in the Daode jing, and\nHuangdi (the Yellow Emperor) as the ruler who applied them for the\nfirst time in human history. Huangdi continued to play the role of the\nperfect \u201cDaoist\u201d ruler in later times: having received\nteachings in various disciplines\u2014medicine, alchemy, sexual\npractices, dietetics, etc.\u2014from different gods, goddesses, and\nimmortals, he would become the patron of some of them. In later times,\nLaozi and Huangdi were even associated with one another as a single\ndeity under the name Huanglao jun, lit., Yellow Old Lord.\n\nIn addition to the central notion of government by\n\u201cnon-doing\u201d (wuwei), the Huang-Lao dao\nappears to have promoted not only other teachings of the Daode\njing, such as the requirement of self-cultivation by the ruler,\nbut also\u2014displaying the first hints of the integration of\nDaode jing teachings and cosmological thought\u2014the\nregulation of political and social life according to cosmic cycles,\nsuch as those of the seasons. The Huang-Lao ideology enjoyed some\nsuccess at court during the early decades of the Han dynasty, but\nquietly disappeared after Confucianism was adopted as official state\ndoctrine by Emperor Wu of the Han (r. 140\u201387 BCE). Nevertheless,\nits political views continued to form one of the bases of the Daoist\nteachings.\n\nIn the past few decades, scholars have described some excavated\nmanuscripts as Huang-Lao sources (e.g., Yates 1997), but no firm\nconclusion has been reached on this point. The same is true of the\nHuainan zi (The Master of Huainan), a major work completed in\n139 BCE under the patronage of Liu An (180\u2013122 BCE), the ruler\nof the southern kingdom of Huainan (in present-day Anhui). The\nHuainan zi contains sections devoted to thought, government,\nself-cultivation, ethics, mythology, hagiography, astronomy,\ntopography, music, military affairs, and other traditional sciences\n(Le Blanc and Mathieu 2003; Major et al. 2010). Its aims of\nsynthesis are also shown by more than 800 quotations drawn from other\ntexts, including about one hundred from the Daode jing and\nover 250 from the Zhuangzi. Yet, although the Huainan\nzi is included in the Daoist Canon and later Daoist hagiography\nhas welcomed Liu An as an \u201cimmortal\u201d, the text as a whole\ncan hardly be described as Daoist. In a historical perspective, the\nHuainan zi is, rather, the main source that documents the\nintegration of early Daoist thought with cosmology and with several\ncosmological sciences. More broadly, as was noted by Nathan Sivin\n(1995), it is one of a series of important texts, written between the\n3rd and the 1st century BCE, that provide\nextensive overviews of cosmology, government, and self-cultivation in\nview of the creation of a comprehensive ideology that would serve as\nthe foundation for a newly created Chinese empire. These works also\ninclude the L\u00fcshi chunqiu (Springs and Autumns of Sire\nL\u00fc; Knoblock and Riegel 2001), the Chunqiu fanlu\n(Luxuriant Dew on the Spring and Autumn Annals; Queen 1996),\nand\u2014with focus on medicine, but sharing the same\nfoundations\u2014the Huangdi neijing (Inner Book of the\nYellow Emperor; Unschuld and Tessenow 2011).\n",
