    "main_text": "Freedom as the Basis of the State\n2. Freedom as the Basis of the State\n\n\u201cThere is only one innate right,\u201d says Kant,\n\u201cFreedom (independence from being constrained by another\u2019s\nchoice), insofar as it can coexist with the freedom of every other in\naccordance with a universal law\u201d (6:237). Kant rejects any other\nbasis for the state, in particular arguing that the welfare of\ncitizens cannot be the basis of state power. He argues that a state\ncannot legitimately impose any particular conception of happiness upon\nits citizens (8:290\u201391). To do so would be for the ruler to\ntreat citizens as children, assuming that they are unable to\nunderstand what is truly useful or harmful to themselves.\n\nThis claim must be understood in light of Kant\u2019s more general\nclaim that moral law cannot be based upon happiness or any other given\nempirical good. In the Groundwork Kant contrasts an ethics of\nautonomy, in which the will (Wille, or practical reason\nitself) is the basis of its own law, from the ethics of heteronomy, in\nwhich something independent of the will, such as happiness, is the\nbasis of moral law (4:440\u201341). In the Critique of Practical\nReason he argues that happiness (the agreeableness of life when\nthings go in accordance with one\u2019s wishes and desires), although\nuniversally sought by human beings, is not specific enough to entail\nany particular universal desires in human beings. Further, even were\nthere any universal desires among human beings, those desires would,\nas empirical, be merely contingent and thus unworthy of being the\nbasis of any pure moral law (5:25\u201326). No particular conception\nof happiness can be the basis of the pure principle of the state, and\nthe general conception of happiness is too vague to serve as the basis\nof a law. Hence, a \u201cuniversal principle of right\u201d cannot\nbe based upon happiness but only on something truly universal, such as\nfreedom. The \u201cuniversal principle of right\u201d Kant offers is\nthus \u201cAny action is right if it can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on\nits maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with\neveryone\u2019s freedom in accordance with a universal law\u201d\n(6:230).\n\nThis explains why happiness is not universal, but not why freedom is\nuniversal. By \u201cfreedom\u201d in political philosophy, Kant is\nnot referring to the transcendental conception of freedom usually\nassociated with the problem of the freedom of the will amid\ndeterminism in accordance with laws of nature, a solution to which is\nprovided in the Third Antinomy of the Critique of Pure\nReason. Rather, freedom in political philosophy is defined, as in\nthe claim above about the only innate right, as \u201cindependence\nfrom being constrained by another\u2019s choice\u201d. His concern\nin political philosophy is not with laws of nature\ndetermining a human being\u2019s choice but by other human\nbeings determining a human being\u2019s choice, hence the kind\nof freedom Kant is concerned with in political philosophy is\nindividual freedom of action. Still, the universality of political\nfreedom is linked to transcendental freedom. Kant assumes that a human\nbeing\u2019s use of choice (at least when it is properly guided by\nreason) is free in the transcendental sense. Since every human being\ndoes enjoy transcendental freedom by virtue of being rational, freedom\nof choice is a universal human attribute. And this freedom of choice\nis to be respected and promoted, even when this choice is not\nexercised in rational or virtuous activity. Presumably respecting\nfreedom of choice involves allowing it to be effective in determining\nactions; this is why Kant calls political freedom, or\n\u201cindependence from being constrained by another\u2019s\nchoice\u201d, the only innate right. One might still object that this\nfreedom of choice is incapable of being the basis of a pure principle\nof right for the same reason that happiness was incapable of being its\nbasis, namely, that it is too vague in itself and that when specified\nby the particular decisions individuals make with their free choice,\nit loses its universality. Kant holds that this problem does not arise\nfor freedom, since freedom of choice can be understood both in terms\nof its content (the particular decisions individuals make) and its\nform (the free, unconstrained nature of choice of any possible\nparticular end) (6:230). Freedom is universal in the proper sense\nbecause, unlike happiness, it can be understood in such a way that it\nis susceptible to specification without losing its universality. Right\nwill be based on the form of free choice.\n\nThe very existence of a state might seem to some as a limitation of\nfreedom, since a state possesses power to control the external freedom\nof individual citizens through force. This is the basic claim of\nanarchism. Kant holds in contrast that there is no innate right to\nunlimited freedom but only an innate right to freedom \u201cinsofar as it\ncan coexist with the freedom of every other in accordance with\nuniversal law\u201d (6:237). Rightful freedom for each individual is\nlimited, and the state is not an impediment to freedom but is the\nmeans for freedom. State action that is a hindrance to freedom can,\nwhen properly directed, support and maintain rightful freedom if the\nstate action is aimed at hindering actions that themselves would\nhinder the rightful freedom of others and thus be wrongful uses of\nfreedom. Given a subject\u2019s action that would limit the freedom\nof another subject, the state may hinder the first subject to defend\nthe second by \u201chindering a hindrance to freedom\u201d. Such\nstate coercion is compatible with the maximal freedom demanded in the\nprinciple of right because it does not reduce overall freedom but\ninstead provides the necessary background conditions needed to secure\nrightful freedom. The amount of freedom lost by the first subject\nthrough direct state coercion is equal to the amount gained by the\nsecond subject through lifting the hindrance to actions. State action\nsustains the maximal amount of freedom consistent with identical\nfreedom for all without reducing it.\n\nFreedom is not the only basis for principles underlying the state. In\n\u201cTheory and Practice\u201d Kant makes freedom the first of\nthree principles (8:290):\n\nThe freedom of every member of the state as a human being.\nThe equality of each with every other as a subject.\nThe independence of every member of a commonwealth as a\ncitizen.\n\n\nFreedom as discussed in \u201cTheory and Practice\u201d stresses the\nautonomous right of all individuals to conceive of happiness in their\nown way. Interference with another\u2019s freedom is understood as\ncoercing the other to be happy as the former sees fit. The direct link\nto action comes when pursuing that autonomously chosen conception of\nhappiness. Each may pursue happiness as they see fit provided that\ntheir pursuit does not infringe upon others\u2019 similar\npursuits.\n\nEquality is not substantive but formal. Each member of the state is\nequal to every other member of the state before the law. Each has\nequal coercive right, that is, the right to invoke the power of the\nstate to enforce the laws on one\u2019s behalf. (Kant exempts the\nhead of state from this equality, since the head of state cannot be\ncoerced by anyone else). This formal equality is perfectly compatible\nwith the inequality of members of the state in income, physical power,\nmental ability, possessions, etc. Further, this equality supports an\nequality of opportunity: every office or rank in the political\nstructure must be open to all subjects without regard for any\nhereditary or similar restrictions.\n\nIndependence concerns citizens as subject to laws they give\nthemselves, i.e. as co-legislators of the laws. This self-governance\ncan be understood as the application in political philosophy of the\nidea of autonomy of the will in the Groundwork. While this\nprinciple appears to require universal democratic decision making for\nparticular laws, Kant uses empirically-based reasoning to argue that\nthis full citizenship does not extend to all. Kant excludes women and\nchildren, simply claiming that their exclusion is natural, as well as\nanyone who is not \u201cone\u2019s own master\u201d, i.e. lacks economic\nself-sufficiency. These individuals who are dependent upon others in\nlife have what Kant calls \u201cpassive\u201d citizenship in the Doctrine of\nRight. Hence decision making is not universal. While Kant thereby\ndenies women and others full citizenship in the ability to take part\nin legislation, he stresses that he is not denying them the rights\nentailed by freedom and equality as \u201cpassive\u201d members of\nthe state. In the Doctrine of Right he also adds that the\npolitical system must allow anyone in the passive condition to work\ntheir way up to independence and an active condition. With this\nrestriction in mind, particular laws are to be determined by a\nmajority of the citizens with voting rights, as will be discussed in\nsection 4.\n",
