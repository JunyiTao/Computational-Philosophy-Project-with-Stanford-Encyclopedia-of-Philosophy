    "main_text": "Epistemological Exclusion\n9. Epistemological Exclusion\n\n\nNew research on moral evolution accords with the above social view of\nmoral knowledge. Michael Tomasello (2016) makes the case that human\nmoral norms have their origin in the phenomenon of \u201cshared\nintentionality\u201d that binds diverse individuals to a common project in\nwhich they see each other as equal partners. When moral norms conflict\neach person in a group that is motivated by these norms is an equal\npartner in the shared project of resolving the moral conflict. If\nmorality is a shared project in this way, the cost of excluding some\npersons from the process of resolving moral conflict can be\nsignificant. Such exclusion can undermine achieving moral knowledge\nthat depends on input from diverse individuals acting as equals.\n\n\nThis understanding of moral knowledge reflects moral concerns of many\nfeminists. For example, Miranda Fricker (2007) examines the \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d of being wrongfully denied recognition as a potential\nknower due to one\u2019s race, gender, or other identity. See also\nKristie Dotson (2011) on the epistemic injustice of silencing caused\nby violence against women. Other feminists point out that non-moral\nknowledge claims can be unfairly biased when they are based only on\nexperience of men or neglect the social structures that unjustly bias\nthe perception of causation. For example, it is sometimes thought that\nthe burden of childrearing is biologically determined. Sarah Baffer\nHrdy (2009), however, offer a new evolutionary perspective on the\nshared responsibility for childcare among early humans. Cordelia Fine\n(2017) challenges the familiar view that gender roles are hormonally\ndetermined. Kate Manne (2018) shows how patriarchy tends to undermine\nsocially our ability to reason freely about gender\ndiscrimination. Even when reasoning is conceived explicitly as being\nsocial and equal, as in social contract theory, the moral upshot of\nreasoning can reflect racial bias when reasoning is abstracted from\nactual social context (Charles Mills 2017) or when the causal effects\nof social structures, like de facto segregation, are ignored\n(Elizabeth Anderson 2010).\n\n",
