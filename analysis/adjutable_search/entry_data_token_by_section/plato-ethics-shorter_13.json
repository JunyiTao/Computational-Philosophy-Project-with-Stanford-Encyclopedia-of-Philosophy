    "main_text": "The Authenticity of the Hippias Major\n17. The Authenticity of the Hippias Major\n\nThe authenticity of the Hippias Major has been in doubt since\nthe middle of the nineteenth century; although many scholars accept it\nas genuine, there are notable exceptions such as Charles Kahn and\nHolger Thesleff. The argument against authenticity is based partly on\nthe silence of classical sources about it, and partly on the style.\nAristotle\u2019s reference to a dialogue called simply the\nHippias is plainly to the Hippias Minor\n(Metaphysics 1025a6\u201313). The style is most likely from\nthe fourth century BCE (Plato\u2019s century), but some scholars have\nargued that its vocabulary places the dialogue too late in the fourth\ncentury for Platonic authorship. The argument in favor of authenticity\nfollows the presumption in favor of the ancient canon of Thrasyllus\n(which is right in most cases) and appeals to the unique and inventive\nfeatures of the dialogue, which betray more artistry than could be\nexpected from a forger. As with a number of dialogues from the canon,\nhowever, the case must be left not proven.\n",
