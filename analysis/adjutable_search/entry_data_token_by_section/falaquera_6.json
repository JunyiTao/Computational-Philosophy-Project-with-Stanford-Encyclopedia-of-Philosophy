    "main_text": "Falaquera as an exegete\n7. Conclusion: Falaquera as a philosopher\n\n\nShem-Tov Falaquera sought to interest his fellow Jews in philosophy\nand science and to make available to them in Hebrew the most important\nteachings of the ancient Greek and medieval Islamic philosophers. As\nis clear from his encyclopedia of science, he was an Aristotelian, and\nlike virtually all post-Maimonidean Jewish Aristotelians, his two\nleading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides.\nNonetheless, he had an open mind and seems to have been influenced\nalso by Neoplatonic writings. This is most evident from his decision\nto prepare Hebrew versions of Ibn Gabirol\u2019s Fons vitae and\nPseudo-Empedocles\u2019 Five Substances, and from his many\ncitations from Ibn Gabirol in his Moreh ha-Moreh (see\nShiffman\u2019s intro., 83\u201385). He knew the works of the Islamic\nfal\u00e2sifah better than any Jewish thinker of his time,\nand made many of them available to the Hebrew reader \u2013 often\nwithout attribution (as in Reshit Hokhmah); yet he was not\nhesitant to modify unobtrusively their texts when it suited his\npurposes. In this way, for example, he turned Alfarabi\u2019s account of\nthe origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of\nthe virtuous city (Harvey, \u201cFalaquera\u2019s Alfarabi,\u201d\n104\u2013109).\n\n\nFalaquera did not seek originality, yet was quite creative in his\npresentation of philosophy and science. He was, for example, one of\nthe first Hebrew authors to write a philosophic dialogue, an\nencyclopedia of science and philosophy, a commentary on the Guide\nof the Perplexed, and poetic philosophic tales. His method of\nseamlessly blending various philosophic texts together to form a\ncoherent whole is perhaps unique to him. But the fact is that his most\nimportant works are comprised of Hebrew versions of the writings of\nothers. We have seen that his personal views on\ntheological-philosophical matters may be discerned from his Moreh\nha-Moreh, particularly when he speaks in his own name. Yet even\nin his earlier works, he often asserted his personal views, but he\nusually let his sources do the talking. When proper care is taken in\nthe study of these works not to jump to conclusions regarding his\nviews on the basis of his translations, it is possible to uncover his\nown theology. The role played by his occasional critical comments in\nhis commentary is played by the selection, blending, and abridgment of\nsources in the earlier works. The theology derived from such careful\nstudy of his translations and from his commentary may not always\naccord completely with that expressed in his more popular independent\ntreatises (such as the Iggeret ha-Vikkuah and Iggeret\nha-Halom), where he explicitly maintains the existence and unity\nof God, His knowledge of particulars, His providence over human\nindividuals, His creation of the world, divine prophecy, miracles,\nreward and punishment, and eternal life, which is the World to\nCome. Scholars will no doubt debate his views on particular topics,\nbut the thinker who emerges from virtually all his writings is a\nmoderate Maimonidean, committed to the essential harmony between the\ntrue teachings of Torah and those of philosophy.\n\n\nThe problem of creation of the world is a good illustration of a topic\nwhere Falaquera seems to convey different opinions in different\nworks. In his popular introductory works, Falaquera writes that among\nthe true opinions of the Torah is that God \u201cbrought into\nexistence the rest of the existents from non-existence\u201d\n(Iggeret ha-Halom, 489), that it is the \u201croot of the\nTorah to believe that there is a Creator of the world \u2026 and He\nbrought into existence all the created beings from nothing, and to\nbelieve that the world is produced and is not eternal\u201d\n(Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, 65), and that while most of the\nphilosophers disagree with our beliefs concerning creation, some of\nthem actually do \u201cbelieve in the production [of the world], but\nnot in the way that we believe in it\u201d (Iggeret\nha-Vikkuah, 77; trans., 46). He thus seems to propound a view of\ncreation ex nihilo, while acknowledging that most\nphilosophers believe in eternity, although some believe in creation,\nbut in a way different than we do, that is perhaps, creation from\neternal matter. Falaquera does state in these works that knowledge of\nthe true sciences is needed to comprehend the secrets of the Torah\n(e.g., Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, 70\u201372).  One could wonder that if\nknowledge of philosophy and science is necessary for understanding the\nsecrets of the Torah and if creation is one of these secrets, why the\nphilosophers do not believe in it \u201cin the way that we believe in\nit.\u201d In the Moreh ha-Moreh, Falaquera clearly states\nthat among the divine secrets is \u201chow God, may He be exalted,\ncreated the created beings\u201d (116). In this commentary, perhaps\nof all Falaquera\u2019s writings the least likely to be read by the\nmultitude, he reveals his own opinion that the world is not created\nfrom nothing. His precise view is debated, but he seems to hold that\nthe world is created from eternal matter, a view that Maimonides had\nascribed to Plato. In his introduction, he suggests that Plato\u2019s view\nthat the world is created and never destroyed derives from the Sages,\nbut since the Sages knew the true interpretation of the Torah, this\nwould seem to mean that Plato\u2019s view was the true one (117). Later in\nthe commentary, he repeats this view and writes that it appears to him\nthat \u201cPlato\u2019s opinion inclines toward the opinion of our holy\nTorah\u201d (259, on Guide II, 13). A bit later in the\nchapter he writes explicitly (261):\n\n\nIt appears to me that there is no need to say that the Creator, may He\nbe exalted, brought into existence the existent from non-existence\n[me-ha-he\u2018der], but rather that he brought it into\nexistence after complete non-existence, for this is possible\naccording to our faith. Therefore, those that say that He, may He be\nexalted, brought [the world] into existence from nothing [do] not\n[express] a precise belief; rather, He brought it into existence after\nnothing, that is, He brought it into existence after the thing did not\nexist.\n\n\nIn other words, Falaquera in the context of his commentary on\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide reveals his own view on creation of the\nworld, one of the secrets of the Torah. This view differs from the one\ncommonly held in the Jewish community of his time, which he himself\ncalled a root and true opinion of the Torah in his more popular works.\nThe view presented in the commentary \u2013 for Falaquera, the true\ninterpretation of the teaching of the Torah and a precise formulation\nof it \u2013 still speaks of God\u2019s creation, not ex nihilo,\nbut rather after non-existence (ahar\nha-he\u2018der) or after privation of form. In other words, it\nappears that for Falaquera, creation is through informing prime matter\n(cf. Shiffman, \u201cFalqerah As Interpreter,\u201d 7\u201314\n[220]). This interpretation of Falaquera\u2019s teaching is strengthened by\nhis explanation of \u2018creation\u2019 (beri\u2018ah) in\nhis Commentary on the Torah: \u201cThe word\n\u2018creation\u2019 teaches creation of the substance and quiddity\nof the thing, through which it is what it is \u2026 for the giving\nof the spirit to the bodies of this world is called\n\u2018creation\u2019. \u2026 [God] gives all creatures substantive\nform, that is, specific form, by which the thing is distinguished from\nsomething else\u201d (Jospe, Torah and Sophia, 468). For\nFalaquera then, some of the philosophers do share a view of creation\nof the world precisely \u201cin the way that we believe in\nit.\u201d\n\n\nThe importance of Falaquera for the history of philosophy is not,\nhowever, in his personal beliefs regarding theological-philosophical\nsubjects. It is rather in his broad and profound knowledge of the\nteachings of the ancient and medieval philosophers, his mastery of\ntheir science, his commitment to the ultimate accord between their\ntrue teachings and the correctly interpreted teachings of the Torah,\nand his life-long effort to interest his fellow Jews in science and\nphilosophy and to make their teachings available to them. To\naccomplish his goals, as we have seen, Falaquera, perhaps more than\nany other medieval Jewish philosopher, employed a wide variety of\ndifferent literary forms (see further, Hughes and\nRobinson 2019).\n",
