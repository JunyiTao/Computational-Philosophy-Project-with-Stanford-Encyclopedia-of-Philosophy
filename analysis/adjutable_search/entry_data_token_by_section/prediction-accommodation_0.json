Historical Introduction\n\nThere was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries a passionate\ndebate about scientific method\u2014at stake was the \u2018method of\nhypothesis\u2019 which postulated hypotheses about unobservable\nentities which \u2018saved the phenomena\u2019 and thus were\narguably true (see Laudan 1981a). Critics of this method pointed out\nthat hypotheses could always be adjusted artificially to accommodate\nany amount of data. But it was noted that some such theories had the\nfurther virtue of generating specific predictions of heretofore\nunobserved phenomena\u2014thus scientists like John Herschel and\nWilliam Whewell argued that hypotheses that saved phenomena could be\njustified when they were confirmed by such \u2018novel\u2019\nphenomena. Whewell maintained that predictions carry special weight\nbecause a theory that correctly predicts a surprising result cannot\nhave done so by chance, and thus must be true (Whewell 1849 [1968:\n294]). It thus appeared that predicted evidence confirmed theory more\nstrongly than accommodated evidence. But John Stuart Mill (in his\ndebate with Whewell) categorically denied this claim, affirming that\n\n\n\n(s)uch predictions and their fulfilment are, indeed, well calculated\nto impress the ignorant vulgar, whose faith in science rests solely\nupon similar coincidences between its prophecies and what comes to\npass. But it is strange that any considerable stress should be laid\nupon such a coincidence by scientific thinkers. (1843, Vol. 2, 23)\n\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes provides a simple account of why predictivism has\na misleading appearance of truth in a brief passage in his book A\nTreatise on Probability:\n\n\nThe peculiar virtue of prediction or predesignation is altogether\nimaginary\u2026 The plausibility of the argument [for predictivism]\nis derived from a different source. If a hypothesis is proposed a\npriori, this commonly means that there is some ground for it,\narising out of our previous knowledge, apart from the purely inductive\nground, and if such is the case the hypothesis is clearly stronger\nthan one which reposes on inductive grounds only. But if it is merely\na guess, the lucky fact of its preceding some or all of the cases\nwhich verify it adds nothing whatever to its value. It is the union of\nprior knowledge, with the inductive grounds which arise out of the\nimmediate instances, that lends weight to any hypothesis, and not the\noccasion on which the hypothesis is first proposed. (1921:\n 305\u2013306)[1]\n\n\n\nBy \u2018the inductive ground\u2019 for a hypothesis Keynes clearly\nmeans the data that the hypothesis fits. Keynes means that when some\ntheorist who undertakes to test a hypothesis first proposes it,\ntypically some other (presumably theoretical) form of support prompted\nthe proposal. Thus hypotheses which are proposed without being built\nto fit the empirical data (which they are subsequently shown to\nentail) are typically better supported than hypotheses which are\nproposed merely to fit the data\u2014for the latter lack the\nindependent support possessed by the former. The appearance of\nplausibility to predictivism arises because the role of the\npreliminary hypothesis-inducing evidence is being suppressed. \n\nKarl Popper is probably the most famous proponent of prediction in the\nhistory of philosophy. In his lecture \u201cScience: Conjectures and\nRefutations\u201d Popper recounts his boyhood attempt to grapple with\nthe question \u201cWhen should a theory be ranked as\nscientific?\u201d (Popper 1963: 33\u201365). Popper had become\nconvinced that certain popular theories of his day, including\nMarx\u2019s theory of history and Freudian psychoanalysis, were\npseudosciences. Popper deemed the problem of distinguishing scientific\nfrom pseudoscientific theories \u2018the demarcation problem\u2019.\nHis solution to the demarcation problem, as is well known, was to\nidentify the quality of falsifiability (or \u2018testability\u2019)\nas the mark of the scientific theory. \n\nThe pseudosciences were marked, Popper claimed, by their vast\nexplanatory power. They could explain not only all the relevant actual\nphenomena the world presented, they could explain any conceivable\nphenomena that might fall within their domain. This was because the\nexplanations offered by the pseudosciences were sufficiently malleable\nthat they could always be adjusted ex post facto to explain anything.\nThus the pseudosciences never ran the risk of being inconsistent with\nthe data. By contrast, a genuinely scientific theory made specific\npredictions about what should be observed and thus ran the risk of\nfalsification. Popper emphasized that what established the scientific\ncharacter of relativity theory was that it \u2018stuck its neck\nout\u2019 in a way that pseudosciences never did. \n\nLike Whewell and Herschel, Popper appeals to the predictions a theory\nmakes as a way of separating the illegitimate uses of the method of\nhypothesis from its legitimate uses. But while Whewell and Herschel\npointed to predictive success as a necessary condition for the\nacceptability of a theory that had been generated by the method of\nhypothesis, Popper focuses in his solution to the demarcation problem\nnot on the success of a prediction but on the fact that the theory\nmade the prediction at all. Of course, there was for Popper an\nimportant difference between scientific theories whose predictions\nwere confirmed and those whose prediction were falsified. Falsified\ntheories were to be rejected, whereas theories that survived testing\nwere to be \u2018tentatively accepted\u2019 until falsified. Popper\ndid not hold, with Whewell and Hershel, that successful predictions\ncould constitute legitimate proof of a theory\u2014in fact Popper\nheld that it was impossible to show that a theory was even probable\nbased on the evidence, for he embraced Hume\u2019s critique of\ninductive logic that made evidential support for the truth of theories\nimpossible. Thus, one should ascribe to Popper a commitment to\npredictivism only in the broad sense that he held predictions to be\nsuperior to accommodations\u2014he did not hold that predictions\nconfirmed theory more strongly than accommodations. It would\nultimately prove impossible for Popper to reconcile his claim that a\ntheory which enjoyed predictive success ought to be \u2018tentatively\naccepted\u2019 with his anti-inductivism (see, e.g., Salmon 1981).\n\n\nImre Lakatos (1970, 1971) proposed an account of scientific method in\nthe form of his \u2018methodology of scientific research\nprogrammes\u2019 which was a development of Popper\u2019s approach.\nA scientific research program was constituted by a \u2018hard\ncore\u2019 of propositions which were retained throughout the life of\nthat programme together with a \u2018protective belt\u2019 which was\nconstituted by auxiliary hypotheses that were adjusted so as to\nreconcile the hard core with the empirical data. The attempt on the\npart of the proponents of the research programme to reconcile the\nprogramme to empirical data produced a series of theories \\(T_1\\),\n\\(T_2\\),\u2026 \\(T_n\\) where, at least in some cases, \\(T_{i+1}\\)\nserves to explain some data that is anomalous for \\(T_i\\). Lakatos\nheld that a research programme was \u2018theoretically\nprogressive\u2019 insofar as each new theory predicts some novel\nhitherto unexpected fact. A research programme is \u2018empirically\nprogressive\u2019 to the extent that its novel empirical content was\ncorroborated, that is, if each new theory leads to the discovery of\n\u201csome new fact\u201d (Lakatos 1970: 118). Lakatos thus offered\na new solution to the demarcation problem: a research programme was\npseudoscientific to the extent that it was not theoretically\nprogressive. Theory evaluation is construed in terms of competing\nresearch programmes: a research programme defeats a rival programme by\nproving more empirically progressive over the long run.\n",
