Two of the foundational and most influential figures of the\nphilosophy of science in Argentina and Latin America, Mario Bunge and\nGregorio Klimovsky, discussed the nature of evolutionary theory in\nterms of the classical view (Carnap 1956), understanding theories as\nhypothetico-deductive systems consisting of a set of starting\nhypotheses, fundamental hypotheses, or principles, along with all\ntheir logical consequences, including derived hypotheses and\nobservational consequences (Klimovsky 1994), or as sets of\npropositions closed under deduction (Mahner & Bunge 1997).\n\nKlimovsky presents an analysis of the theory of evolution (following\nJulian Huxley 1942) standard to Darwin\u2019s argument,\nwhich distinguishes two parts. One of these corresponds to the\nshort argument or core of the argument, of which natural\nselection is the conclusion. In the other part, the explanatory power\nof natural selection and its evidential support are tested. In basic\nagreement with several authors (Wallace 1891; Huxley 1942; Flew 1959;\nGhiselin 1969; Lewontin 1978; Ruse 1979; Ospovat 1981 and Mayr 1982,\n1991, 2001; among others), Klimovsky reconstructs the short\nargument as a hypothetico-deductive argument with the principle\nof natural selection as its conclusion. He (1971, 1994) distinguishes\nthree levels of statements of a scientific theory. Level 1: basic or\nsingular empirical statements, containing only observational terms;\nlevel 2: general empirical statements or empirical generalizations;\nand level 3: general theoretical statements with theoretical terms.\nAccording to Klimovsky (1994), the theory of evolution is\ncharacterized by not including level 3 statements, in accordance with\nwhat Putnam (1962) pointed out with regards to Darwin\u2019s original\nformulation.\n\nAnna Carolina K.P. Regner, who transitioned from initially working as\na general philosopher of science to becoming a professional\nphilosopher of biology and played a significant role in the\nintroduction and consolidation of philosophy of biology in Brazil,\ncriticizes hypothetico-deductive reconstructions of Darwin\u2019s\nshort argument. She claims that by virtue of the meaning of\nthe concepts that appear in the premises and conclusion, this argument\nfails to satisfy at least two basic requirements for a deductive\nargument: independence of the premises from each other and\nindependence of the premises from the conclusion (Regner 2010).\nRegarding the constructive part of her analysis, Regner maintains that\nthe Origin of Species as a whole presents one long\nargument as a narrative without a linear structure, as a network\nmade up of successive steps that take the form of chapters or partial\narguments, each of which summarizes the preceding step and introduces\nthe subsequent ones, such that the parts sustain the whole. On the\nother hand, it is from the complete argument that each part derives\nits support and meaning. She emphasizes that Darwin makes use of\ndifferent resources throughout his work, including metaphors and\ndialectical and rhetorical arguments, in addition to more traditional\nlogical arguments and procedures (Regner 2010; see also\n Section 5.4).\n\nIn his book, written in conjunction with German biologist and\nphilosopher of science Martin Mahner (Mahner & Bunge 1997), Bunge\nargues that there is no unified hyper-general theory of evolution.\nRather, evolutionary theory is not a proper theory but, as Lewis\n(1980) states, a system of theories with different degrees of\ngenerality, with the theory of natural selection being the most\nconspicuous example of a hypergeneral theory in evolutionary\nbiology (Mahner & Bunge 1997: Section 9.3.3). Mahner and Bunge\nargue that there is no reason to abandon the view of scientific\ntheories as hypothetico-deductive systems and instead adopt the\nsemantic view of theories given that there is nothing in mathematical\nstructures and state spaces that cannot be expressed by propositions.\nHowever, these authors propose considering the theory of natural\nselection in terms of models: either as the family of all their\ntheoretical models or as their union (Mahner & Bunge 1997: Section\n9.3.3), which actually constitutes the core of the semantic view, as\nwe will see in\n Section 4.3.\n\nBefore moving on, we must mention the analysis of medical theories\nmade from the classical view of theories by Argentine physician,\nphilosopher and historian of science C\u00e9sar Lorenzano. As early\nas 1977, during his Mexican exile, he published an analysis of Hans\nSelye\u2019s stress theory, or General Adaptation Syndrome (Selye\n1952), following Klimovsky\u2019s teachings of the classical view.\nLorenzano\u2019s intention was to show that, first, medicine has\ntheories in several of its subdisciplines, such as anatomic pathology,\npharmacology, and therapeutics, but at its very core, physiopathology,\nthe theories possess theoretical terms, that statements from level 3.\nThis contrasts with to Klimovsky\u2019s analysis of the theory of\nnatural selection. Second, Lorenzano argued that medicine should be\nstudied independently of biology, though the two fields are related.\nFinally, he stated that medicine should not be considered a craft or\nan applied science, that is, a biological technique, but rather a\nscience in its own right, reducible neither to biology nor to a small\npart of all theoretical and practical medical knowledge, namely, the\nmedical clinic (C. Lorenzano 1977). This argument runs counter to Kuhn\n(1962 [1970]) and Bunge (1967).\n",
