    "main_text": "Later Works\n7. Influence and Legacy\n\nGiven the controversial nature of many of his writings and the\ndifficulty in interpreting his works, Pomponazzi\u2019s influence was\nvaried. Opponents accused him of undermining organized religion,\nabetting Lutheranism, and contributing to the development of atheism.\nAlternatively, he has been praised for promoting intellectual freedom,\nimproving methods for interpreting Aristotle, and preparing the way\nfor the materialism and positivism of modern science.\n\nAlthough his writings do not appear to follow the demand of\nApostolici regiminis that philosophers defend Catholic dogma\nto the best of their ability, ecclesiastical authorities did little to\nenforce the Fifth Lateran Council. While never convicted of\nheresy, or even tried for it, nevertheless after the\npublication of On the Immortality of the Soul he\nfaced significant turmoil, including accusations of heterodoxy\nand the burning of copies of his books at Venice. Some\nadversaries, such as Ambrogio Flandino, associated On Fate\nwith Martin Luther\u2019s and Jan Hus\u2019s denials of free will,\nan association that continued throughout the sixteenth century (Del\nSoldato 2010). That Guglielmo Gratarolo, a Calvinist exiled from\nBergamo living in Basel, printed On Incantations and On\nFate potentially confirmed perceived links to heterodoxy\n(Maclean 2005). As the Counter Reformation more clearly defined\nCatholic orthodoxy in the second half of the sixteenth century, many\nCatholic theologians and philosophers, especially Jesuits, saw his\nteachings as noxious and a potential source of heresy. During the\nseventeenth century, concerns over Pomponazzi grew in part due to the\nconvicted and executed heretic Giulio Cesare Vanini (d. 1619), who\nappropriated a number of Pomponazzi\u2019s arguments. Subsequently,\nmany scholars, including Fran\u00e7ois Garasse, Marin Mersenne, and\nTommaso Campanella, linked him to atheism and to Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli\u2019s promotion of religious imposture as a political\ntool. Yet he still had his defenders. The erudite Frenchman Gabriel\nNaud\u00e9 praised Pomponazzi both for his wit and for his\nhistorically accurate interpretation of Aristotle. As a result,\nPomponazzi became linked to seventeenth-century libertinism (Martin\n2014: 94\u201395, 124\u201344).\n\nDespite numerous negative assessments, some sixteenth-century\nphilosophers pursued Pomponazzi\u2019s approach. For example, Simone\nPorzio, a professor of philosophy at Pisa, followed his mortalist and\nAlexandrian take on the human intellect (Del Soldato 2010). Even\nthough many throughout the seventeenth century condemned his\nview that the soul dies with the body, Pierre Bayle absolved\nPomponazzi of impiety, found him to be an example of freedom of\nthought, and praised him for his ethical teachings that spurned the\ninducements of the afterlife (Bayle 1740: vol. 3, 777\u201383). In\nthe nineteenth century, he was championed by positivists, such as\nErnest Renan and Roberto Ardig\u00f2, who upheld Pomponazzi as a\nmodel for the scientific spirit that opposed religious oppression\n(Ardig\u00f2 1869; Renan 1852: 284\u201388). During the twentieth\ncentury, a number of scholars endorsed the views of\nseventeenth-century libertines, interpreting Pomponazzi as insincere,\na promoter of religious imposture, or as a determined enemy of\nChristianity (see Busson 1957: 44\u201369; Charbonnel 1919:\n220\u201374, 389\u2013438). Accordingly, he gained among some the\nepithet \u201cRadical Philosopher\u201d (see Pine 1986). Other\nscholars, following the leads of Bruno Nardi and Paul Oskar\nKristeller, placed him in the context of the secular tradition of\nmedieval philosophy that separated theology from philosophy (Bianchi\n2008). Under that interpretation, Pomponazzi was not necessarily an\ninstigator or harbinger of the conflicts between church and\nscience of the modern period but rather better understood as\ncontinuing scholastic philosophical practices, which\nincluded open inquiry, that took root in the thirteenth\ncentury.\n",
