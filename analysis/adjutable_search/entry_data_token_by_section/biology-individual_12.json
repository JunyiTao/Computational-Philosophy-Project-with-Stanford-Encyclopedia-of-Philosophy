Locating Biological Individuals in Conceptual Space\n\nThe discussion in\n section 6\n has drawn out more about the conceptual space that physiological\nindividuals occupy and their relationship to evolutionary individuals.\nThis section offers a more complete and integrative overview of that\nconceptual space. Before populating the running summary diagram with\nexamples of various kinds of biological individuals, we first simply add\nDarwinian or evolutionary individuals to\n Figure 3\n and label the resulting nine regions in it to arrive at\n Figure 5:\n \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Adding Darwinian Individuals.\n[An\n extended description of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs simple as this modification to\n Figure 3\n is, it allows for much more fine-grained answers to the Focal\nQuestion, both in terms of the relationship between the subsidiary\ncategories living agents, organisms, and Darwinian individuals, and in\nterms of where particular individuals are located in the resulting\nconceptual space. It may turn out that some of these regions are\nunoccupied by actual biological individuals, or that some of the\nadjacent regions collapse into one another. But the following proceeds\nby indicating how the preceding discussion suggests all nine regions\nare exemplified by distinct kinds of biological individual, moving\nfrom less contentious to more contentious examples.\n\nFirst, consider the lower half of\n Figure 5\n and regions 1, 2 and 3. While organisms are both Darwinian\nindividuals and living agents, there are two different types of\nDarwinian individuals that are not living agents: some parts of\norganisms, such as genes (region 2) and, perhaps more controversially,\ngroups such as colonies of eusocial insects (region 3). For example,\nhoney bee colonies appear to be Darwinian individuals even though they\nare not literally living agents. Each individual bee within a colony\nis alive, but as suggested by the discussion of living agency in\n section 6,\n it is only by invoking the cognitive metaphor that the whole colony\nitself can be said to be a living agent.\n\nSecond, consider the outermost regions to the left and right of\n Figure 5,\n regions 4 and 5. There are both some parts and some groups of\norganisms that are neither organisms nor Darwinian individuals nor\nliving agents. Most parts of the cellular machinery possessed by\norganisms, such as lysosomes (region 4) or ribosomes, are biological\nindividuals that, like genes, are not living agents, but unlike them,\nare not Darwinian individuals. Groups with this same status include\nhigher taxa, such as species and clades discussed in\n section 4.\n Clades (region 5) are neither organisms nor living agents. And even\nthe most optimistic of clade selectionists will probably agree that a\nrelatively inclusive and diverse taxon such Bryophyta,\nconsisting of about 10,000 moss species, is not itself a Darwinian\nindividual. Yet if the common assumption that monophyletic clades are\na type of biological individual is accepted, Bryophyta will\nnonetheless count as a biological individual (De Luna, Newton, &\nMishler 2003\n Other Internet Resources).\n Bryophyta thus belongs in the far right of\n Figure 5.\n\nThird, consider the upper half of\n Figure 5\n and regions 6 and 7. There are correspondingly two different types of\nliving agents that are not Darwinian individuals: some parts of\norganisms such as hearts (region 6) and (again, perhaps more\ncontroversially), groups of organisms such as coral reefs (region 7).\nAs physiological individuals, hearts are alive but they do not\nreproduce or relate to reproducers in the manner that Darwinian\nindividuals do. As suggested at the end of\n section 6.1,\n a coral reef may also be an example of this kind of biological\nindividual at the group level. Coral reefs don\u2019t feature the\ntype of reproduction-involving life cycles characteristic of\norganisms, and some of the same facts about reproduction likely\ndisqualify them from being Darwinian individuals. Yet perhaps the\nreefs (in addition to their constituent individuals) have a better\nchance than eusocial insect colonies of counting as living agents.\n\nFinally, what of the two remaining regions of\n Figure 5,\n regions 8 and 9? These contain, respectively, biological individuals\nthat are parts of organisms and are both Darwinian individuals and\nliving agents, and organisms that are living agents but not Darwinian\nindividuals. Some viruses are at least plausible candidate examples of\nthe former category (region 8), since they have the internal\ncomplexity and unity of function possessed by physiological\nindividuals but employ a scaffolded form of reproduction that relies\non the replicative machinery of their host. And perhaps corporate\norganisms that are typified by tightly integrated multispecies\ncomplexes exemplify the latter (region 9). Consider again the Hawaiian\nbobtail squid plus its colony of Vibrio fischeri bacteria\nthat Godfrey-Smith (2013) discusses as such an example (see\n Figure 1\n above). Those who view this entity as an organism do so because of\nthe intricate integration between squid and bacteria (Nyholm &\nMcFall-Ngai 2004; Bouchard 2010). As such, it seems to be a living\nagent or physiological individual. But lacking a reproductive life\ncycle, it is not a Darwinian individual. One might well argue, by\ncontrast, that this feature of the squid-Vibrio complex also\ndisqualifies it as an organism, making it no different in\nkind from coral reefs. Resolving this issue will turn partly on how\nexactly different sorts of reproduction are distinguished, and which\nsorts are required for evolution by natural selection, topics that\nhave recently become more intensely debated (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2015,\n2016b; Griesemer 2014, 2016; O\u2019Malley 2016).\n\nFigure 6\n completes this running visual summary of conceptual space that\nbiological individuals occupy, with the addition of a table which\nassociates the regions with the examples discussed above.\n\n\n\n\nRegions with their examples\n\n\nregion\nexample \n\n\n1\nFruit fly\n\n2\nGene\n\n3\nEusocial insect colony\n\n4\nLysosome\n\n5\nClades (such as Bryophyta)\n\n6\nHeart\n\n7\nCoral reef\n\n8\nVirus\n\n9\nSquid+Vibrio bacteria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Biological Individuals in\nConceptual Space.
