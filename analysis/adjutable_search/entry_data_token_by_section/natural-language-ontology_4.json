    "main_text": "Natural Language Ontology as An Emerging Discipline and Practice || Ontology Reflected in Natural Language, in Cognition, and in Reasoning\n1.5 Ontology Reflected in Natural Language, in Cognition, and in Reasoning\n\nIt is tempting to take the ontology of natural language to just be the\nontology implicit in cognition, including perception. In fact, often\nresearchers pursuing natural language ontology take research in\ncognitive science into account or pursue interdisciplinary research in\nboth areas at once (e.g., Wellwood et al. 2012; Wisniewski et al.\n1996). While there are without doubt important connections and a\nsignificant overlap, the two ontologies need to be kept distinct. To\ngive an example, it is generally agreed that the ontology implicit in\ncognition in general, that is, the ontology of ordinary objects, is\nnot closed under sum formation, but rather subject to constraints of\ngestalt (integrity) as well as function (Schaffer & Rose 2017).\nThus, the sum of the stuff in my room does not form an entity that\nbelongs to the ontology of ordinary objects and neither does the sum\nof the Eiffel Tower and the Dalai Lama. But natural language appears\nto allow for unrestricted sum formation with definite mass and plural\nNPs and conjunctions of definite singular NPs (the stuff in my\nroom, the Eiffel Tower and the Dalai Lama), at least on\nthe dominant view on which definite plural and mass NPs stand for sums\n (\u00a73.1.1).\n Another example of a divergence between the ontology implicit in\ncognition and in natural language is the mass-count distinction, with\nchoices such as the English mass noun pasta and the French\nplural count noun p\u00e2tes hardly reflecting a cognitive\ndistinction\n (\u00a73.3).\n\nGiven the divergence of the ontology of natural language from that\nreflected in cognition, how does the ontology of natural language\nrelate to cognitive agents? What sort of ontological commitment does\nit involve? One option may be that the ontology of natural language is\nthe ontology a speaker accepts just when using the language. This\ncannot be right, though: a speaker may just accept the ontology by\ncoincidence when using the language. Rather the acceptance of the\nontology of natural language has to be strictly tied to the use of\nlanguage; it has to be acceptance that necessarily goes along with the\nuse of language, that is, ontological acceptance by way of using\nthe language.\n\nThere is another cognitive dimension that matters for distinguishing\nthe ontology of natural language, namely that of intuition as opposed\nto inferential belief, reasoning, or reflection (see entry on\n Intuition).\n Natural language can be used for making and denying various\nontological claims and for introducing revisionary ontological\ntheories. This may consist both in making ontological assertions and\nin introducing expressions for the purpose of conveying a particular\nontological notion (see\n \u00a74.1).\n\nThe practice of natural language ontology, as it has been pursued by\nphilosophers and linguistics, makes a clear distinction between the\nsorts of linguistic data indicative of the ontology implicit in\nnatural language and those indicative of an ontology based on\nreasoning. Explicit metaphysical assertions are not indicative of the\nontology implicit in natural language, for example assertions of the\nfollowing sentences (whether they are widely believed or not):\n\n(1)\n\n\na.\nThere are artifacts.\nb.\n Objects are not events.\nc.\n There are things that don\u2019t exist\n\n\n\nNo philosopher or linguist would appeal to sentences such as\n (1a, b, c)\n when arguing for an ontology of artifacts, of states distinct from\nevents, or of nonexistent entities. Otherwise, another philosopher or\nlinguists might just as well appeal to the negations of\n (1a, b, c),\n which are equally acceptable, to argue for just the opposite. Such\nuses of language do not display the ontology implicit in natural\nlanguage, but rather ontological views based on reasoning, that is,\nontologies that philosophers accept when thinking about there is or\nontologies that non-philosophers (\u201cthe folk\u201d) naively\naccept when thinking about what there is. The latter are the subject\nmatter of folk metaphysics (Schaffer 2019), the analogue of folk\nphysics and folk biology.\n\nThe ontology of natural language is instead displayed in other ways.\nOne way in which it has been taken to manifest itself is in\npresuppositions of ontological categories carried by certain\npredicates: stop and happen require events, and\nmove and exist (enduring) objects, on pain of\nresulting in a category mistake (but see Magidor 2013 for a critical\ndiscussion). A particularly important way in which the ontology of\nnatural language manifests itself is restrictions of particular types\nof NPs to ontological categories of entities they may stand for.\n'Perfect nominals' like John\u2019s buying of the house can\nonly stand for events, 'imperfect nominals' like John\u2019s\nbuying the house can only stand for facts (Vendler 1967). Bare\nadjective nominalizations like wisdom can only stand for\nqualities, and adjective nominalizations with a specifier\n(Socrates\u2019 wisdom) for tropes; deverbal nominalizations\nlike laughter are generally restricted to events\n (\u00a71.3).\n Quantificational NPs like every time can range only over\ntimes or situations, quantifiers like somewhere only over\nplaces, and quantifiers like somehow only over qualities.\nOther ways in which the ontology of natural language manifests itself\nwill be elaborated in\n Section 2.2.\n \n\nThe distinction between ontological assertions and presuppositions\ngoes along with two ways of accepting an ontology: acceptance though\nreasoning or reflection and implicit acceptance by way of using the\nlanguage. The latter should be part of the definition of the ontology\nimplicit in natural language (Moltmann 2019):\n\n(2)\n The ontology of a natural language is the ontology speakers\nimplicitly accept by way of using the language.\n\n\nNote that it may very well turn out that the ontology arrived at\nthrough reasoning is the very same as the ontology implicit in natural\nlanguage. What matters thus is the relation of agents to the ontology,\nrather than the nature of the ontology itself.\n\nThe ontology of natural language is reflected not only in\npresuppositions, but also in certain kinds of linguistic data that are\ngenerally inaccessible to linguistically uninformed philosophical or\nnaive reflection. These are syntactic analyses of sentences that would\nbe unavailable to non-linguists and involve particular ontological\ncommitments. One example is syntactic analyses that posit silent\nsyntactic elements with ontological content. Thus, Kayne (2005: chap.\n8) argues that the sentence John has few books contains a\nsilent (antecedent-less) occurrence of the noun number, which\nsuggests that the actual structure of the sentence, John has few\nnumber books, involves reference to\na number. Another example is syntactic analyses that make use of\nlexical decomposition with ontological relevance. Thus, Harves &\nKayne (2012) argue that the underlying form of the English verb\nneed is have need, which involves an ontological\ncommitment to things like needs that is not evident from the simple\nverb need alone. Underlying syntactic structures of this sort\nare posited in generative linguistics on the background assumption\nthat knowledge of grammar is implicit and to an extent innate. If\nontological notions go along with such structures, then they should be\njust as much part of implicit knowledge as the syntactic structures\nthemselves, which means that they will be unavailable to rejection or\nrevision through reasoning.\n\nTaking ontology to be part of the implicit knowledge of grammar may\nalso solve the puzzle of how it is possible for a speaker to reject\nupon reflection (part of) the ontology that is implicit in natural\nlanguage while still committing herself to it through the continued\nuse of the language. On such a view, the implicit acceptance of the\nontology of natural language would not be a form of belief, but rather\na form of tacit knowledge on a par with that of grammar (Moltmann\n2020a). This would explain the robustness of such a form of implicit\nacceptance, which resists rejection upon reflection as long as the\nagent uses the same language, unlike the implicit acceptance or bias\nin ethics, for example, which does permit rejection upon reflection\n(see entry on\n implicit bias).\n\nDistinguishing implicit acceptance of an ontology through the use of\nlanguage from metaphysical reflection does of course not prevent the\nlatter to come into play when building a theory of the\nontology reflected in natural language. Natural language data may\nprovide only a partial specification of a particular ontological\nnotion so that metaphysical reasoning would fill in the rest\u2014at\nleast on a view on which natural language ontology is also part of\nmetaphysics and not just linguistics (cf.\n \u00a71.1),\n and metaphysical reasoning may give independent support for\nontological notions reflected in natural language.\n",
