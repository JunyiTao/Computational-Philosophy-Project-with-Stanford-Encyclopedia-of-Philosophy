    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Who, and What, is \u201cNegro\u201d?\n5.4 Who, and What, is \u201cNegro\u201d?\n\nLurking in the background of all of this talk of the \u201cNew\nNegro\u201d is the assumption that there is something distinctively\nNegro about at least some American art. As to what that is, or could\nbe, answers are sometimes extremely hard to come by. But, Locke warns\n\n\n[s]ooner or later the critic must face the basic issues involved in\nhis use of risky and perhaps untenable terms like \u2018Negro\nart\u2019 and \u2018Negro literature\u2019 and answer the\nmuch-evaded question unequivocally,\u2014who and what is Negro? (WWN\n209)\n\n\nBeyond this Locke thinks it a meaningful query to ask whether the\nracial concept has any place in art at all. Perhaps it would be better\nto understand art as a cultural or social mode of production that cuts\nacross racial and ethnic divisions.\n5.4.1 Who is Negro?\n\nIn answering the question \u201cWho is Negro?\u201d Locke begins by\nexposing a common misguided assumption in such queries:\n\n[t]he fallacy of the \u2018new\u2019 as of the \u2018older\u2019\nthinking is that there is a type Negro who, either qualitatively or\nquantitatively, is the type symbol of the entire group. (WWN 210)\n\n\nLocke sees this as the unfortunate consequence of the past need to\nproffer counter-stereotypes to combat demeaning stereotypes of Negro\npersons. Counter-stereotypes may well contain some element of truth,\nbut they fail to convey the whole truth about as diverse a population\nof human beings as Negroes in the United States, let alone the\nAmericas or Negroes the World over. There is no distinctive singular\nNegro type. The answer then to the question posed \u201cwho is\nNegro?\u201d is no Negro in particular. The Negro is a dynamic and\nmultifaceted population admitting of myriad cultural and social forms\ncharacterized as those are by variegated linguistic, religious and\nartistic elements. This is important for Locke to note as the Negro of\nhis day was thought to be classless, undifferentiated, and ethnically\nhomogeneous. In fact, Locke himself thought it possible (and actual)\nfor human beings biologically similar in the way that American race\nthinking presupposes to be members of different races. A full and\naccurate artistic portrayal of who is Negro would, Locke argued, have\nto picture the many diverse Negro strands in their own right, weaving\ntogether from these diverse threads a multifaceted presentation of\nNegro experiences.\n5.4.2 What is Negro?\n\n\u201cTurning to the other basic question,\u2014what is\nNegro,\u201d Locke begins by narrowing the question to \u201cwhat\nmakes a work of art Negro, if indeed any such nomenclature is\nproper,\u2014its authorship, its theme or its idiom?\u201d (WWN\n211). In other words, what gives a particular work of art its\ndistinctive, if any, racial character: the racial identity of its\nauthor, its treatment of themes characteristic of a particular racial\nexperience in a particular place, or its use of styles and modes of\nexpression peculiar to a given people? Of these three candidates for\nthe foundation of Negro art Locke claims each has had its day\ndepending on the social environment that was prevalent at the time.\nLocke dismisses nearly out of hand the first option remarking that\nmany a Negro artist has produced the most amateurish works of art due\nprimarily to their poor mastery of Negro idioms, and inadequate\ntreatment of Negro themes. What is more, some white (or at least\nnon-Negro) artist have been quite adept in either their use of\ncharacteristically Negro styles, or their dealings with Negro motifs.\nOf course, it stands to reason that artist steeped in the cultural,\nethnic and racial environments that give rise to these idioms and\nthemes are most likely to master their use and expression, and that\npersons who do so are most likely to be members of these communities,\nhaving the same racial, ethnic or cultural identities as other\nmembers. However, such communal membership is not a necessary\ncondition for the work of a particular artist to count amongst the\nworks that comprise a racially distinctive body of art such as might\nbe called \u201cNegro art.\u201d\n",
