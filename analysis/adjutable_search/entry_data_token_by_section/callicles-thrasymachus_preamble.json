    "main_text": "\n\nCallicles and Thrasymachus are the two great exemplars in philosophy\nof contemptuous challenge to conventional morality. Both are\ncharacters in Platonic dialogues, in the Gorgias and Book I\nof the Republic respectively; both denounce the virtue of\njustice, dikaiosun\u00ea, as an artificial brake on\nself-interest, a fraud to be seen through by intelligent people.\nTogether, Thrasymachus and Callicles have fallen into the folk\nmythology of moral philosophy as \u2018the immoralist\u2019 (or\n\u2018amoralist\u2019). These are perhaps not quite the right words,\nbut it is useful to have a label for their common \nchallenge\u2014more generally, for the figure who demands a good reason to abide by\nmoral constraints, and denies, implicitly or explicitly, that this\ndemand can be\n met.[1]\n Because of this shared agenda, and because Socrates\u2019 refutation\nof Callicles can be read as an unsatisfying rehearsal for the\nRepublic, it is tempting to assume that the two share a\nsingle philosophical position. But in fact Callicles and Thrasymachus\nare by no means interchangeable; and the differences between them are\nimportant both for the interpretation of Plato and philosophically,\nfor our understanding of the varieties of immoralism and the\nmotivations behind it. This article discusses both the common\nchallenge presented by these two figures and the features which\nseparate them, treating them strictly as players in Plato\u2019s\nphilosophical dramas. (Thrasymachus was a real person, a famous\ndiplomat and orator of whose real views we know only a little; of\nCallicles we know nothing, and he may even be Plato\u2019s\n invention.)[2]\n It will also compare them to a third Platonic version of the\nimmoralist challenge, the one presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus in\nRepublic Book II, and to the writings of sophist \nAntiphon\u2014the best-known real-life counterpart of all three Platonic\nviews, and perhaps their historical original. Certain aspects of\nPlato\u2019s own arguments against immoralism will also be discussed,\ninsofar as they help to clarify what Callicles and Thrasymachus\nthemselves have to say.\n",
