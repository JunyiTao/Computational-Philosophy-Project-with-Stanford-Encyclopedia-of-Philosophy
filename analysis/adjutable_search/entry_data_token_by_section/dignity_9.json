    "main_text": "Human Dignity: Touchstones of Analysis || Individuals vs. species\n3.2 Individuals vs. species\n\nThe conclusion of the last section brings to mind another theoretical\ndividing line in the literature, between those arguing for human\ndignity qua human individual, and those arguing for human\ndignity qua species. Which is it?\n\nSome say, both. For example, Kateb (2011) argues that we must explain\nthe uniqueness of persons and the species: \u201cI am what\nno one else is, while not existentially superior to anyone else; we\nhuman beings belong to a species that is what no other species\nis\u201d (2011: 17). According to Kateb (echoing Cicero), humans are\npartly divorced from the natural order both individually and\ncollectively, in virtue of possessing unparalleled and morally special\ncapacities for self-creation. Moreover, Kateb is clear that the\ndistinctiveness of human dignity also grounds human normative\nsupremacy. Indeed, on his view, human supremacy is one of the defining\nproperties of dignity: \u201cThe core idea of human dignity is that\non earth, humanity is the greatest type of being\u201d (2011:\n3\u20134); we are \u201cthe highest species on earth\u2014so\nfar\u201d (2011: 17).\n\nOf course, such claims are contentious. But if we want to engage them,\nit is important to be clear about whether we are doing so at the\ndefinitional level, or at the level of dignity\u2019s grounds. For\nexample, recall Cicero\u2019s claim that it is in virtue of our\ndistinctive capacities for self-development \u201cby study and\nreflection\u201d, that human beings have a \u201csuperior\u201d\n\u201cnature\u201d to that of \u201ccattle and other\nanimals\u201d. This Ciceronian idea about the grounds of dignity\nshares affinities with many other extant views, including Kant, Pico,\nand obviously Kateb. And we have considered reasons for rejecting this\nline of argument. But even if one accepts it, the present point is\nthat one might not endorse Kateb\u2019s claim about the\n\u201ccore idea\u201d of dignity being essentially about the human\nspecies. That is, one could agree with Kateb about what grounds\ndignity but disagree that part of what defines dignity, is the\nproperty of species superiority. Stern (1975) and Gaylin (1984), for\nexample, agree that the concept of dignity is most essentially about\nhuman worth or status, but argue that this does not imply that the\nhuman species possesses dignity. It only implies that each\nindividual human has dignity.\n\nFinally, any claim about the dignity of the species or collective\nhumanity must confront worries about speciesism, and in turn all the\nobjections of those who think that non-human animals have a purchase\non the normative space of dignity (see, e.g., Rachels 1990; Pluhar\n1995; LaFollette & Shanks 1996; Bekoff 1998; Meyer 2001; Rolston\n2008; Singer 2009; and especially Gruen 2003 [2010], who explores the\nidea of \u201cwild dignity\u201d.)\n",
