Philosophy of Science: Confirmation\n\nOn Whewell\u2019s view, once a theory is invented by\ndiscoverers\u2019 induction, it must pass a variety of tests before\nit can be considered confirmed as an empirical truth. These tests are\nprediction, consilience, and coherence (see 1858b, 83\u201396). These\nare characterized by Whewell as, first, that \u201cour hypotheses\nought to fortel [sic] phenomena which have not yet been\nobserved\u201d (1858b, 86); second, that they should \u201cexplain\nand determine cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation\u201d of those hypotheses (1858b, 88);\nand third that hypotheses must \u201cbecome more coherent\u201d over\ntime (1858b, 91).\n\nI start by discussing the criterion of prediction. Hypotheses ought to\nforetell phenomena, \u201cat least all phenomena of the same\nkind,\u201d Whewell explained, because \u201cour assent to the\nhypothesis implies that it is held to be true of all particular\ninstances. That these cases belong to past or to future times, that\nthey have or have not already occurred, makes no difference in the\napplicability of the rule to them. Because the rule prevails, it\nincludes all cases\u201d (1858b, 86). Whewell\u2019s point here is\nsimply that since our hypotheses are in universal form, a true\nhypothesis will cover all particular instances of the rule, including\npast, present, and future cases. But he also makes the stronger claim\nthat successful predictions of unknown facts provide greater\nconfirmatory value than explanations of already-known facts. Thus he\nheld the historical claim that \u201cnew evidence\u201d is more\nvaluable than \u201cold evidence.\u201d He believed that \u201cto\npredict unknown facts found afterwards to be true is \u2026 a\nconfirmation of a theory which in impressiveness and value goes beyond\nany explanation of known facts\u201d (1857/1873, II, 557). Whewell\nclaimed that the agreement of the prediction with what occurs (i.e.,\nthe fact that the prediction turns out to be correct), is\n\u201cnothing strange, if the theory be true, but quite\nunaccountable, if it be not\u201d (1860a, 273\u20134). For example,\nif Newtonian theory were not true, he argued, the fact that from the\ntheory we could correctly predict the existence, location and mass of\na new planet, Neptune (as did happen in 1846), would be bewildering,\nand indeed miraculous.\n\nAn even more valuable confirmation criterion, according to Whewell, is\nthat of \u201cconsilience.\u201d Whewell explained that \u201cthe\nevidence in favour of our induction is of a much higher and more\nforcible character when it enables us to explain and determine [i.e.,\npredict] cases of a kind different from those which were\ncontemplated in the formation of our hypothesis. The instances in\nwhich this have occurred, indeed, impress us with a conviction that\nthe truth of our hypothesis is certain\u201d (1858b, 87\u20138).\nWhewell called this type of evidence a \u201cjumping together\u201d\nor \u201cconsilience\u201d of inductions. An induction, which\nresults from the colligation of one class of facts, is found also to\ncolligate successfully facts belonging to another class.\nWhewell\u2019s notion of consilience is thus related to his view of\nnatural classes of objects or events.\n\nTo understand this confirmation criterion, it may be helpful to\nschematize the \u201cjumping together\u201d that occurred in the\ncase of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, Whewell\u2019s\nexemplary case of consilience. On Whewell\u2019s view, Newton used\nthe form of inference Whewell characterized as\n\u201cdiscoverers\u2019 induction\u201d in order to reach his\nuniversal gravitation law, the inverse-square law of attraction. Part\nof this process is portrayed in book III of the Principia,\nwhere Newton listed a number of \u201cpropositions.\u201d These\npropositions are empirical laws that are inferred from certain\n\u201cphenomena\u201d (which are described in the preceding section\nof book III). The first such proposition or law is that \u201cthe\nforces by which the circumjovial planets are continually drawn off\nfrom rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to\nJupiter\u2019s centre; and are inversely as the squares of the\ndistances of the places of those planets from that centre.\u201d The\nresult of another, separate induction from the phenomena of\n\u201cplanetary motion\u201d is that \u201cthe forces by which the\nprimary planets are continually drawn off from rectilinear motions,\nand retained in their proper orbits, tend to the sun; and are\ninversely as the squares of the distances of the places of those\nplanets from the sun\u2019s centre.\u201d Newton saw that these\nlaws, as well as other results of a number of different inductions,\ncoincided in postulating the existence of an inverse-square attractive\nforce as the cause of various classes of phenomena. According to\nWhewell, Newton saw that these inductions \u201cleap to the same\npoint;\u201d i.e., to the same law. Newton was then able to bring\ntogether inductively (or \u201ccolligate\u201d) these laws, and\nfacts of other kinds of events (e.g., the class of events known as\n\u201cfalling bodies\u201d), into a new, more general law, namely\nthe universal gravitation law: \u201cAll bodies attract each other\nwith a force of gravity which is inverse as the squares of the\ndistances.\u201d By seeing that an inverse-square attractive force\nprovided a cause for different classes of events\u2014for satellite\nmotion, planetary motion, and falling bodies\u2014Newton was able to\nperform a more general induction, to his universal law.\n\nWhat Newton found was that these different kinds of\nphenomena\u2014including circumjovial orbits, planetary orbits, as\nwell as falling bodies\u2014share an essential property, namely the\nsame cause. What Newton did, in effect, was to subsume these\nindividual \u201cevent kinds\u201d into a more general natural kind\ncomprised of sub-kinds sharing a kind essence, namely being caused by\nan inverse-square attractive force. Consilience of event kinds\ntherefore results in causal unification. More specifically,\nit results in unification of natural kind categories based on a shared\ncause. Phenomena that constitute different event kinds, such as\n\u201cplanetary motion,\u201d \u201ctidal activity,\u201d and\n\u201cfalling bodies,\u201d were found by Newton to be members of a\nunified, more general kind, \u201cphenomena caused to occur by an\ninverse-square attractive force of gravity\u201d (or,\n\u201cgravitational phenomena\u201d). In such cases, according to\nWhewell, we learn that we have found a \u201cvera causa,\u201d or a\n\u201ctrue cause,\u201d i.e., a cause that really exists in nature,\nand whose effects are members of the same natural kind (see 1860a, p.\n191). Moreover, by finding a cause shared by phenomena in different\nsub-kinds, we are able to colligate all the facts about these kinds\ninto a more general causal law. Whewell claimed that \u201cwhen the\ntheory, by the concurrences of two indications \u2026 has included a\nnew range of phenomena, we have, in fact, a new induction of a more\ngeneral kind, to which the inductions formerly obtained are\nsubordinate, as particular cases to a general population\u201d\n(1858b, 96). He noted that consilience is the means by which we effect\nthe successive generalization that constitutes the advancement of\nscience (1847, II, 74). (For early discussions of consilience see\nLaudan 1971 and, especially, Hesse 1968 and Hesse 1971; for more on\nconsilience and its relation to realism and natural kinds, see Snyder\n2005 and Snyder 2006. On consilience and classification, see Quinn,\n2017. For more on Whewell and scientific kinds, see Cowles 2016.)\n\nWhewell discussed a further, related test of a theory\u2019s truth:\nnamely, \u201ccoherence.\u201d In the case of true theories, Whewell\nclaimed, \u201cthe system becomes more coherent as it is further\nextended. The elements which we require for explaining a new class of\nfacts are already contained in our system\u2026.In false theories,\nthe contrary is the case\u201d (1858b, 91). Coherence occurs when we\nare able to extend our hypothesis to colligate a new class of\nphenomena without ad hoc modification of the hypothesis. When Newton\nextended his theory regarding an inverse-square attractive force,\nwhich colligated facts of planetary motion and lunar motion, to the\nclass of \u201ctidal activity,\u201d he did not need to add any new\nsuppositions to the theory in order to colligate correctly the facts\nabout particular tides. On the other hand, Whewell explained, when\nphlogiston theory, which colligated facts about the class of phenomena\n\u201cchemical combination,\u201d was extended to colligate the\nclass of phenomena \u201cweight of bodies,\u201d it was\nunable to do so without an ad hoc and implausible\nmodification (namely, the assumption that phlogiston has\n\u201cnegative weight\u201d) (see 1858b, 92\u20133). Thus coherence\ncan be seen as a type of consilience that happens over time; indeed,\nWhewell remarked that these two criteria\u2014consilience and\ncoherence\u2014\u201care, in fact, hardly different\u201d (1858b,\n95).\n",
