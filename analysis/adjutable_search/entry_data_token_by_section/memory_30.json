    "main_text": "The Ethics of Memory || The right to be forgotten\n10.3 The right to be forgotten\n\nOur increasing reliance on novel forms of external memory, may have\nsurprising ethical ramifications. The default for human memory is to\nforget, and most of the information that we encounter never makes its\nway into long-term memory. The default for computer memory, in\ncontrast, is to remember, and researchers are beginning to explore the\nethical implications of moving from a state of affairs in which\nforgetting is the norm, in the sense that one\u2019s\nwords and deeds would in general leave few permanent traces, to one in which\nremembering is the norm, in the sense that many of our words and deeds\nleave behind more or less permanent digital traces\n(Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009). When remembering is the norm, people\nmay, in particular, be deprived of any opportunity for a fresh start\nafter engaging in inappropriate behaviours, leading some to argue for\na right to be forgotten (Ghezzi, Pereira, &\nVesnic-Alujevic 2014; J. Rosen 2012). From a legal and technological\npoint of view, such a right is likely to be difficult to implement.\nFrom a moral point of view, a right to be forgotten may imply a duty\nto forget, and it is unclear whether we can plausibly be held to have\nsuch a duty (Matheson 2013).\n",
