    "main_text": "Types of Computer Simulations || Equation-based Simulations\n2.1 Equation-based Simulations\n\n\nEquation-based simulations are most commonly used in the physical\nsciences and other sciences where there is governing theory that can\nguide the construction of mathematical models based on differential\nequations. I use the term \u201cequation based\u201d here\nto refer to simulations based on the kinds of global equations we\nassociate with physical theories\u2014as opposed to \u201crules of\nevolution\u201d (which are discussed in the next section.) Equation\nbased simulations can either be particle-based, where there are n many\ndiscrete bodies and a set of differential equations governing their\ninteraction, or they can be field-based, where there is a set of\nequations governing the time evolution of a continuous medium or\nfield. An example of the former is a simulation of galaxy\nformation, in which the gravitational interaction between a finite\ncollection of discrete bodies is discretized in time and space. \nAn example of the latter is the simulation of a fluid, such as a\nmeteorological system like a severe storm. Here the system is\ntreated as a continuous medium\u2014a fluid\u2014and a field representing its\ndistribution of the relevant variables in space is discretized in space\nand then updated in discrete intervals of time.\n",
