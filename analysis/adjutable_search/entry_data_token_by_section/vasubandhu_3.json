    "main_text": "Major Arguments from the Treasury of the Abhidharma || Momentariness and Continuity\n2.2 Momentariness and Continuity\n\nFor centuries before Vasubandhu, Buddhist philosophers of the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din tradition had believed in, and argued for, the\ndoctrine of universal\n momentariness.[24]\n This view was a Buddhist scholastic interpretation and expression of\nthe Buddha\u2019s doctrine that all things in the world of ordinary\nbeings were subject to causes and conditions, and therefore\nimpermanent. Buddhists rejected the notion of substances with changing\nqualities, and affirmed instead that change was logically impossible.\nTo be, for Buddhists, is to express certain inalienable\ncharacteristics, whereas to change must be to exhibit the nature of a\ndifferent being. Vasubandhu adopts this view, employing it in many\ncontexts: \u201cAs for something that becomes different: that very\nthing being different is not accepted, for it is not acceptable that\nit differs from itself.\u201d (AKBh 193.9\u201310)\n\nOne can see how the impossibility of change, coupled with the doctrine\nof impermanence, served to prove that all things persisted for only a\nmoment. Vasubandhu certainly shared this view, and he drew upon the\npremises of impermanence and the impossibility of change to establish\nmomentariness in his own works. Yet, as von Rospatt (1995) has shown,\nVasubandhu added a new twist to the argument. What he added was that\nthings must self-destruct, for destruction cannot be caused.\nAnd why not? Because a cause and a result are real entities, and the\nostensible object of a destruction is a non-existent. How, he asks,\ncan a non-existent be a result?\n\nGiven that things must bring about their own destruction, then,\nVasubandhu needs only to recall the impossibility of change to\nestablish momentariness. If things have it as part of their nature to\nself-destruct, they must do so immediately upon coming into being. If\nthey do not have it as part of their nature, it can never become\n so.[25]\n\nThe great difficulty for such a position is accounting for apparent\ncontinuities. The standard Buddhist explanation is that usually, when\nthings go out of existence, they are replaced in the next moment by\nnew elements of the same kind, and these streams of entities cause the\nappearance of continuity. Modern interpreters often illustrate the\npoint with the example of the apparent motion on a movie screen being\ncaused by a quick succession of stills. This is said to be the case\nwith the many entities that appear to make up the continuous self, and\nof course this was the main reason the Buddha affirmed his doctrine of\nimpermanence in the first place. Yet for some phenomena, to call their\ncontinuity merely apparent causes philosophical problems, even for\nBuddhists. Consequently, Vasubandhu, like his Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nforbears, was repeatedly preoccupied with the need to account for\ncontinuity.\n\nMany of the more prominent problems in continuity have already been\nmentioned in the discussion of Vasubandhu\u2019s disproof of the self\n(see above), including the problem of memory, the problem of the\nreference of a name, and the problem of karmic causality across\nmultiple lifetimes. See also the section on the disproof of invisible\nphysicality for Vasubandhu\u2019s rejection of the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika response to a specific problem of\ncontinuity.\n\nOne issue of great importance for the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra traditions, and consequently of interest to current\n scholarship,[26]\n is a problem specific to Buddhist meditation theory. The problem\ncomes from an apparent inconsistency among well-founded early Buddhist\nscriptural positions. On the one hand, there was the orthodox belief\nthat the body was kept alive by consciousness. Even in deep sleep, it\nwas believed that there was some form of subtle consciousness that was\nkeeping the body alive. On the other hand, there was the very old\nbelief, possibly articulated by the Buddha himself, that there are six\nkinds of consciousness, and that each of them is associated with one\nof the six senses\u2014the five traditional senses, plus the mental\nsense (which observes mental objects). The problem was that there are\nsome meditative states that are defined as being completely free of\nall six sensory consciousnesses. So the question becomes,\nWhat keeps the meditator\u2019s body alive when all consciousness is\ncut off?\n\nRelated to this is the problem that, given that each element can be\ncaused only by a previous element of a corresponding kind (in an\nimmediately preceding moment), there does not seem to be any way for\nthe consciousness, once cut off, to restart. The distinctive,\nearly Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine of the \u201cstore\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) or the\n\u201chidden consciousness\u201d\u2014the consciousness that is\ntucked away in the body\u2014was first introduced to solve these\ncontinuity problems. Equally problematic is the same issue in reverse:\nWithout some doctrinal shift there does not seem to be any way that\nbeings born into formless realms, with no bodies, could be reborn\namong those with physical form. The later, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra view\nthat everything is only appearance takes care of this, too, by\neliminating the need for real physicality. (See the section concerning\ndisproof of invisible physicality.) Vasubandhu sets out these problems\nin the Treasury of the Abhidharma without resolving them;\nwhen he writes from a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra perspective, he resolves them\nwith recourse to the store consciousness and appearance-only.\n",
