A Framework for Naturalist Analysis\n\nScholars differ among themselves regarding the classical period in\nIndian Philosophy, but here we will assume the classical period to\nreach from the end of the Vedic era to the beginning of the early\nmodern age in the fifteenth century CE. Classical Indian philosophy is\nby no means a monolith but accommodates within it different systems\nwhich either admitted or denied the infallibility of the Vedas (the\nhallowed Revealed Scripture of the Hindus). The systems upholding the\nauthority of the Vedas are Ved\u0101nta, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nS\u0101\u1e43khya, Yoga, Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, while\nthe systems that challenged its scriptural authority include\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka materialism and various schools of Buddhism and\nJainism. Naturalistic traits are available in these systems, but first\nit is necessary to determine the sense of naturalism relevant for the\npurpose at hand.\n\nPeter Strawson in his Woodbridge Lectures (Strawson 1987) points out\nthat the term \u2018naturalism\u2019 is elastic in its use. He\ndistinguishes two main varieties: hard or reductive and soft or\nliberal naturalism. Hard naturalists view human beings with their\ndifferent endowments as mere \u2018objects\u2019\u2014parts of\nnature\u2014to be described, analysed and causally explained. The\nclaim is that it is possible to have an absolute and pure objective\nview of human beings and their behaviour. Soft naturalists, on the\nother hand, are ready to accommodate subjective dispositions and\npersonal attitudes within a general naturalistic framework. Following\nJohn McDowell (1998, 2004, 2008), Ganeri (2012) proposes a more\nnuanced naturalist scheme to classify non-Cartesian Theories of\nMind/Self propounded by classical Indian philosophers where the\ndistinction between hard naturalism and relaxed/ liberal naturalism\ndepends on a distinction between a realm of law and a space of\nreasons. While the realm of law provides an explanatory framework for\nideal physics, the space of reason or the logical space justifies\n\u2018conditions of our humanity\u2019. On this theory, thinking,\nknowing, freedom of will, considered \u2018natural powers of human\nbeings\u2019 can be accommodated within relaxed naturalism,\n\u2018though they are beyond the reach of natural scientific\nunderstanding, \u2026, without thereby relegating them to the\nsphere of the occult or supernatural\u2019 (McDowell, 2008). Another\nway of discriminating naturalists in recent literature (Kornblith\n1985, Papineau 2007) is to distinguish between methodological and\nsubstantive naturalism; where the former has as its sub-varieties (a)\nReplacement Theory and (b) Expansionist/ Normative Theory, while the\nlatter may be subdivided into Ontological and Semantic varieties.\nAccording to Methodological Naturalism, philosophical theorizing\nshould be continuous with empirical enquiry in the sciences. Some\nMethodological Naturalists want to do away with normative\njustification theories and to replace them with empirical and\ndescriptive explanatory accounts. Other Methodological Naturalists are\nmore liberal and retain the normative level with the proviso that the\ntheorist must not forget that \u2018it is an empirical question what\nnormative advice is actually usable and effective for creatures like\nus\u2019. Ontological Substantive Naturalism is the reductive view\nthat there exists only natural and physical things and Semantic\nSubstantive Naturalists emphasize that philosophical analysis of any\ntheoretical concept must show it to be amenable to empirical\nenquiry.\n\nA rejection of the supernatural is the point of minimal agreement\namongst naturalists of all types, but there is no consensus regarding\nthe boundary between natural and supernatural. Most schools of Indian\nphilosophy identify nature with the empirical world or the world of\nexperience. Two extreme views about the empirical world are available\nto Indian theory. The Advaita Ved\u0101ntins declare the world of\nexperience unreal, an apparent transformation of the eternal and\nunchanging ultimate conscious principle. To the materialist\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas, on the other hand, this world is real and it is\ncomposed of physical matter, consciousness is an emergent property of\nmatter and self is nothing but conscious material body. They were also\nknown as svabh\u0101vav\u0101dins (a term translatable as\n\u201cnaturalists\u201d) because to discard everything supernatural\nfrom their world-view they subscribe to a doctrine which holds that\nthe occurrence of an effect is not determined by its cause but by its\nessential nature, thus making causation entirely redundant. This is\nindeed a unique move in the history of naturalism, for all types of\nnaturalism in the West are intimately connected with the provision of\na causal account of the world or of nature. In terms of our earlier\ntaxonomy, the Advaita Ved\u0101ntins might be branded as\nnon-naturalist and the C\u0101rv\u0101kas as hard naturalist. In\nbetween these two lie the Buddhists, the Jainas, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas and the S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga\nphilosophers, whose accounts of the empirical world need to be\nanalysed carefully if we are accurately to place them. Two questions,\nthe answers to which will help to discern naturalist traits in these\nsystems, are: what are the ultimate constituents of the empirical\nworld, and what is the accepted model of causation for a particular\nschool? For the bounds of nature are to be determined by the nature of\nreal entities as admitted in a system and the nature of causal\nconnection amongst these entities. If only physical things governed by\nthe rules of mechanical causation are taken to be natural, then\nattempts would be made either to reduce psychological, biological,\nsocial, moral and mathematical entities to the physical or to\nestablish somehow their causal relevance to the physical world.\n\nOnly C\u0101rv\u0101ka hints at the causal closure of the physical\nworld, and the four models of causation entertained in Indian\nphilosophy allows interactions between matter and consciousness,\nmaterial particles and mathematical entities, non-living and living\nbeings, accumulated merits and demerits of past actions and present\nevents, and so on. This, however, should not lead one to think that\nIndian thinkers admit transgression of the barrier between the natural\nand the supernatural. On the contrary, they establish their own\ncriteria of demarcation and in doing so legitimize the admission of\nvarious kinds of entities in the \u2018natural world\u2019.\n",
