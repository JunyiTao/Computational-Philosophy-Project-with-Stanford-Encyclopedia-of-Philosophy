    "main_text": "Birthing the Word and Being in the World: Eckhart\u2019s Mystagogical Ethics || Learning to Let Go: Negative Virtue and Non-Attachment\n9.2 Learning to Let Go: Negative Virtue and Non-Attachment\n\nThe idea that God cannot be found in ways puts those who wish to\nfollow Eckhart\u2019s spiritual advice in a tricky position. On the\none hand, the Meister claims that God cannot be sought in means and\nthat we should give up our attempts to find God via spiritual,\nmystical, or moral techniques. On the other hand, he often seems to\nimply that we can and even should do something to put\nourselves in a position that would allow the intellectual conception\nof the Word to be \u201ctriggered\u201d in us:\n\n\nAll God wants of you is for you to go out of yourself in the way of\ncreatureliness and let God be within you,\n\n\nhe exclaims.\n\n\nMy dear friend, what harm can it do you to do God the favor of letting\nHim be God in you? Go right out of yourself for God\u2019s sake, and\nGod will go right out of Himself for your sake. (Pr. 5b; DW\nI:91; MW 110)\n\n\nEckhart also extols the active pursuit and cultivation of certain\nhabitual ways of being that he takes to be most valuable in freeing\nthe self from its worldly attachments and keeping our\n\u201ccreaturely impulses\u201d in check (Connolly 2014: 185),\nthereby opening up the very possibility of becoming receptacles for\nthe divine. Whereas the more traditional Aristotelian and Christian\nvirtues tended to revolve around moral and spiritual\nformation, Eckhart\u2019s focus on cultivating attitudes of\n\u201cdetachment\u201d (abgescheidenheit) and\n\u201creleasement\u201d or \u201cletting-go-ness\u201d\n(gel\u0203zenheit) created a set of more Stoic-sounding\nnegative virtues (Griffioen & Zahedi 2018) that could\nassist the individual in the pursuit of the un-formation\n(another sense of entbildung) of their sinful souls (see,\ne.g., BgT; DW V:12; MW 527; see also Wackernagel 1993).\nInsofar as the cultivation of such virtues can lead a soul from\ndivision to unity, from distraction by attachment to the world to a\nfocus on knowledge of one\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d self (and\ntherefore of God), the soul can be \u201cpurified in the exercise of\nvirtues\u201d, creating the conditions for the ascent \u201cinto the\nlife of unity\u201d and the realization of oneness with the Word in\nthe ground of the soul (Pr. 9; DW I:136; MW 405).\n\nUnderstanding Eckhart on these points is not easy, and scholars have\nstruggled with this mystagogical aspect of his thought. However, the\nMeister was not the first to grapple with the tension between activity\nand passivity, between human action and divine grace, that inevitably\nappears when classical philosophy comes into contact with Christian\ntheology. To some extent, much of his philosophical thought might even\nbe characterized as an attempt to provide a metaphysics that can make\nsense of these aspects of Christian doctrine. Whatever the case, the\ncommon thread in Eckhart\u2019s mystagogical and moral\nthought seems to be that attachment to anything distinct from God\nhinders the soul from true freedom and keeps God and the soul apart\nfrom one another (Milne 2016: 97). This includes those seeking God via\nsuch methods as \u201cprayer, fasting, vigils, and all kinds of\noutward discipline and mortification\u201d, since any \u201cwork to\nwhich you are possessively attached\u201d is something that\n\n\ninvolves the loss of freedom to wait on God in the here and now, and\nto follow Him alone in the light wherein He would show you what to do\nand what not to do, every moment freely and anew, as if you had\nnothing else and neither would nor could do otherwise. (Pr.\n2; DW I:28\u201329; MW 78)\n\n\nIndeed, it is perhaps the notion of possessiveness that\ncharacterizes the fundamental problem of the human being. True freedom\ninvolves a kind of self-dispossession, and a letting go of the\nattachment to the \u201cmine-ness\u201d of one\u2019s actions. This\nfor Eckhart is the kind of spiritual \u201cpoverty\u201d that\nresults in genuine freedom. Here, the Meister mirrors many of his\nBeguine predecessors (and not a few of his Muslim Sufi counterparts)\nin characterizing human freedom, not in the modern sense of\nfreedom from external constraint, or even the ability to do otherwise,\nbut rather as acting in consonance with that which is wholly unified\nand thereby wholly unencumbered by the hindrances of multiplicity,\ndivision, and internal conflict\u2014namely, with the divine will\n(Griffioen & Zahedi 2018). In fact, Eckhart\u2019s emphasis on\ndispossession takes him even further. It is not merely sufficient that\nour will be in conformance with God\u2019s will, but rather\nour actions should be a result of God\u2019s acting through\nus: \u201cIf our will is God\u2019s will, that is good, but if\nGod\u2019s will is our will, that is far better\u201d (Pr.\n25; DW II:9; MW 92).\n",
