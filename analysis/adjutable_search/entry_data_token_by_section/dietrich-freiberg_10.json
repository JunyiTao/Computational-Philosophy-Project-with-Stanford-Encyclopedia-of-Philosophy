    "main_text": "The Resplendence of the Intellect\n11. The Resplendence of the Intellect\n\n\nDue to its superiority and to the fact that it is no being, the\nintellect is resplendent with the universe of beings. \u201cAll\nbeings shine forth (resplendent) in its essence,\u201d he\nsays. One must be careful here, however, not to misunderstand what\nDietrich means by beings \u201cshining forth\u201d. He is not\nadvocating a doctrine of divine illumination of the intellect. To be\nsure this phrase might be rendered \u201cAll beings are\nintellectually illuminated in its essence,\u201d and then interpreted\nto mean that Dietrich holds some doctrine of divine illumination for\nthe intellect. When Albertus Magnus refers to resplendence it is\nusually safe to construe what he says in terms of some form of divine\nillumination. But this will not do for Dietrich of Freiberg. He simply\ndoes not hold a doctrine of illumination\u2014at least not in the sense\nthat Albert or other earlier medieval philosophers did. Martin\nGrabmann made the observation many years ago that the doctrine of\ndivine illumination was used less and less as the 13th Century drew to\na close. Dietrich shows evidence of disavowing the doctrine in his\nphilosophical study of the intellect and its normal operations. In the\npassage mentioned above we have to clearly understand that Dietrich is\ntrying to say that the intellect reflects all things\u2014they shine\nforth in it, not because the intellect is undergoing an act of divine\nillumination, but because in the order of ens conceptionale\nthe things are in the intellect first as conceptions and are\nexemplified there as part of the nature of intellect. The conclusion\nthat Dietrich wishes to draw is that the intellect, being always in\nact through its essence, contains in itself the whole universe of\nbeings, which shine forth from it into the cosmos.\n\n\nDietrich makes a very interesting and important application of this\ndoctrine of the resplendence of the intellect. Man, according to\nDietrich, is cut off from his own intellect. He does not explain why\nthis is, but no doubt it involves the theological doctrine of the\nfall.  He does say, however, that man is not fully joined to his\nintellect, an intellect that is always in act and resplendent with the\nuniverse of beings. Were he to be fully joined to his intellect, were\nthe intellect to become man\u2019s form, then man would understand\neverything all at once.  This, Dietrich suggests, is exactly what\nhappened in the famous vision of St. Benedict in which he saw the\nwhole universe.\n",
