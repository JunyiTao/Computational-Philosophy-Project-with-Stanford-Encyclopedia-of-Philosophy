    "main_text": "Pure, nonhybrid interpretivism\n4. Pure, nonhybrid interpretivism\n\n\nPure interpretivism is nonhybrid. It understands principles,\ninstitutional practice, and their relation differently.\n\n\nInterpretivism begins at the question how institutional practice bears\non rights and obligations. For hybrid interpretivism, this question\nis, at least in part, pre-empted by the orthodox view on which it\nbuilds. Recall that according to the orthodox view, the practice itself (and\nultimately the very idea of law as that is commonly understood;\ncf. Raz 1986: 1114, 1994: 235 ff.) determines how the practice bears on rights\nand obligations. This is so because the practice consists in\ncommunication or tacit endorsement of norms which is meant to place subjects\nunder obligations just by virtue of communicating or endorsing the\nnorms. By taking all this as given, hybrid interpretivism\nbegs in some considerable part the fundamental question at which\ninterpretivism says one must begin.\n\n\nIn doing so, hybrid interpretivism commits itself to the existence of\nsome normative content\u2014the norms and the obligations that follow\nfrom them\u2014that is constituted by institutional practice\nalone. Moral principles contribute some more normative content, and\nthe final content imputed to the law is some combination of the\ntwo.\n\n\nBy shedding the orthodox base layer of its hybrid counterpart, pure,\nnonhybrid interpretivism takes no part of the basic question as\nsettled in that way. It therefore does not take the practice already\nto contribute norms, obligations, or any other kind of normative\ncontent, whether outright or from a point of view, or to consist in\ncommunication that conveys or is intended to constitute normative\ncontent. It understands the idea that the practice, nonnormatively\nspecified, plays a role in the fundamental explanation of the content\nof the law differently: the practice is a factor in the explanation,\nbut does not alone constitute any content. Nonhybrid interpretivism says that moral\nprinciples determine how the practice may determine such content.\n\n\nThere are several important implications. Institutional practice is\nconceived in terms of actions and attitudes, not norms or communication of norms. We start at what people do and say and think. Assemblies draft, debate, amend, and\nenact statutes. Agencies develop and adopt regulations. Courts\nconsider disputes, resolve them and issue opinions, including\ndissents, which offer reasons that support resolving the disputes in\none or another way. In short, institutions and agents operating within\nthem take actions, including the action of producing certain texts or\nutterances, and hold a variety of attitudes, whose role as\ndeterminants of legal rights and obligations is itself determined by\nthe moral principles in play. The principles may assign a\ncertain legal significance to the fact that some assembly produced a\ntext with some linguistic content. It does not follow from the fact that the action of producing the text is legally relevant that the action constituted a norm with the same content. Nonhybrid interpretivism does not assume that institutional practice consists in communication of norms with its own logic that is logic of the law. It does not assume that the practice contains in itself the\nparticular way in which enactments or decisions \u201care\nmeant\u201d to constitute obligations. How institutional actions\nconstitute obligations (the metaphysical mechanism) a matter for\ntheory. There is no special, privileged institutional perspective so\nno internal, perspectival notion of obligation.\n\n\nA further implication is that legal obligations are not constituted by\nthe say-so of institutions, nor are their contents determined by what\ninstitutions said. A legal obligation need not match the content of\nofficial language (though a variety of moral factors will often see to it that it does)\nand needn\u2019t be an obligation to take action for the reason that some institution\nsaid so. If that\u2019s obedience, legal obligation needn\u2019t be obligation\nto obey.\n\n\nIt follows that the purpose of moral explanation is not to assess the moral force of\nobligations whose content (and perspectival existence) is given in\nadvance of the explanation. It is to explain how obligations come to\nobtain, and therefore what their content is. No prior question of\ncontent is taken as settled, and no further question of force is left\nopen.\n\n\nSince it competes, rather than build upon, the orthodox view that institutions communicate or\ntacitly endorse norms (which thereby become legally valid), pure interpretivism has no use for\nthe orthodox notion of norms understood to play substantial\nexplanatory roles (or for a metaphysically important notion of a law,\nas distinct from the informal notion that picks out statutes or other\nlegislation). It is not a doctrine about the conditions of validity of norms. Legal\nnorms (or other standards) may figure in conclusions of\nreasoning that summarize the legal effect of institutional practice\nand are useful for exposition. Since standards so understood\nare derived from the explanation of the legal effect\nof practice, their existence is\nnot constitutively responsible for the\neffect. Standards may also play an epistemic role: we may draw inferences\nabout what rights and obligations exist from tried and tested\nformulations of standards, but the inferences are always subject to\nindependent confirmation and the formulations are subject to revision\n(Dworkin 1978: 76; Greenberg 2007; Stavropoulos 2013).\n\n\nA related point concerns the structure of the explanation. On the\northodox explanation of law, institutions issue directives each of which conveys and thereby creates a valid norm.  The\nimpact of each individual institutional action is therefore distinct:\nit is the addition of a valid norm to the law. Norms so constituted\nare then weaved together to form the complete content of the\nlaw. (This is not to deny that, on this view, some of the norms may concern precisely\nhow to weave norms together, for example by stipulating that lex\nposterior derogat legi priori.) The explanation is in that sense\natomistic (Greenberg 2007). Nonhybrid interpretivism is not so\ncommitted. Since it holds that morality determines how institutional\npractice affects rights and obligations, it inherits the holistic\nstructure of morality: the whole of morality confronts the whole of\ninstitutional practice and determines its effect, which interpretation\npurports to identify. Particular episodes of institutional practice,\nsay the enactment of a new statute, change rights and obligations by\nchanging the content of the practice and therefore its moral effect\n(Greenberg 2007, 2011a).\n\n\nThe notion of justification is very different on this view.  Moral\nfacts fix the relevance of other factors. The moral principles that\nreflect those facts do not add content to the law, which needs to be combined with \ncontent otherwise contributed by institutions. They determine which precise aspect of institutional practice is relevant to the practice\u2019s contribution to the law. The moral facts are therefore fundamental to the constitutive explanation of law, but do not directly determine its content. They determine how institutional practice determines the law.\n\n\nA familiar hypothesis of that kind involves the principle that\ndisputes that are similar in morally relevant respects should be treated\nalike. This hypothesis dictates identifying morally relevant respects\nin cases, which introduces a role for further hypotheses involving\nmore specific principles that pick out those respects. Consider an\nimaginary case, Roe v Doe, where Doe is ordered to compensate Roe for\nthe damage that she incurred, which was caused by Doe\u2019s action. In the\ncurrently relevant sense, a principle, e.g., that one is responsible\nfor damage caused by one\u2019s carelessness on some conception of due\ncare, would be germane in case it identified the factor that was\nrelevant to Doe\u2019s liability. If it did, it would normatively explain\nwhy Doe was ordered to pay\u2014it would show how it\u2019s right that he\nwas. At the same time, the principle would determine how this decision\nwould bear on other cases, given the duty to treat like alike. It\nwould reflect the facts that ground the duty of due care and the\nliability that due care entails that is articulated by the\nprinciple. A principle that figures in such a hypothesis must, first,\njustify resolving an actual or hypothetical contested case in a\nparticular way; and, second, justify resolving past actual or\nhypothetical settled cases, i.e., cases the outcome of which is not in\ndispute in the instant case, in the way they were or would have been\nresolved. Hypotheses of this character have similar functions, whether\nthey concern the action of institutions or of litigants. By picking\nout the morally relevant features of some aspect of institutional\npractice, hypotheses of principle function as explanations of the\nlegal relevance of that aspect of the practice today.\n\n\nCandidate factors are not restricted to what institutions said; nor\nare they restricted to what settled legal opinion considers\nrelevant. Perhaps the court said that the fact that the damage was\ncaused by Doe\u2019s carelessness was what made him liable to pay compensation. But the court might not have said so\u2014it might have\nmentioned something else, or said some conflicting things. Or it might\nhave mentioned carelessness and damage, but might have failed to say whether the\nmagnitude and likelihood of the damage compared to the burden of\nprecaution were germane to the standard of care that Doe failed. Would\nthe fact that the court failed to mention these considerations rule\nout their relevance to future cases? The answer would depend on some\nfurther principles that explained why and how past decisions as a kind\nare relevant, if they are, to instant cases. If courts should respect\ntheir past decisions because doing so reduces uncertainty or mitigates other\ncosts of economic transactions, a principle that the court failed to\narticulate might be irrelevant to the bearing of a case on future\ncases. But if courts\u2019 responsibility is to engage with their past\ndecisions because they must act with integrity, such principles may be\ndecisive (Hershovitz 2006b).\n\n\nThese complications are not special to case law. A number of candidate\nfactors might plausibly determine a statute\u2019s effect on legal rights and\nobligations. The plain meaning of the text of the statute; the actual\n(linguistic) intentions of certain members or the assembly as a whole\n(on some conception of corporate linguistic intention) to say or\nstate something by producing the text; their intentions to change\nlegal rights and obligations in a certain way, i.e., to secure some\nlegal effect by using the specific language of the statute; the effect\nthey would have intended to achieve if they had considered some\ncircumstances they did not; the effect they wanted the statute to be\nregarded by the courts to have; the effect they expected it to be\nregarded to have; their second-order intention that a certain\nfirst-order intention, e.g., their linguistic intention, control the\neffect of the statute; the political practices that existed before the\nrelevant statute was enacted and were not thought at the time and ever\nsince to have been affected by its enactment (Scalia\n1998); the purposes the statute was formally announced to serve in its preamble\nor in its sponsors\u2019 reports; the reasons given in its defense during\ndebates; and so on. Often all of these considerations will pull in the\nsame direction, so the choice among them would make no perceptible\ndifference. But they needn\u2019t, and we can always construct\nhypotheticals to test their relative contribution to the impact that\nsome decision has on the law.\n\n\nFor pure interpretivism, interpretive hypotheses are such tests and\nare designed to support the relevant theoretical choices. The\nhypotheses appeal to principles of political morality that justify\nsome particular aspect of the institutions\u2019 action having a role as a\ndeterminant of rights and obligations. By doing so, they aim to\nestablish, for each candidate determinant of law, its precise impact\non the law, including its impact when some other candidate pulls in a\ndifferent direction (cf. Dworkin 1985, 1986,\n1998; Greenberg 2004; Stavropoulos 2013).\n\n\nCandidate relevant factors include considerations\u2014texts,\npractices, or attitudes\u2014that concern the very question how\ncandidate determinants bear on the law. Intentions about which\nintentions count, mentioned above (discussed in Dworkin 1985 and 1986)\nare such factors and canons or conventions of interpretation and\nprocedural provisions are familiar further examples. These are not\nexempt from the question why and so how they should bear on the\nlaw. Something other than the factors must determine their relevance\nto the law, even when it is pre-theoretically plausible that they are\nindeed relevant. For example, an interpretive convention tends to have\na significant effect on expectations about how the relevance of the\nother institutional factors that the convention concerns would be\nassessed in court, such that considerations of fairness favour\nconforming to the convention. If so, the convention is vindicated by\nconsiderations other than itself, and this holds for any similar\nfactor (see Dworkin 1985, 1986 regarding legislative intentions;\nGreenberg 2004 regarding any aspect of the practice that concerns the\nrelevance of other aspects).\n\n\nIn this conception, the difficulties of hybrid interpretivism do not\narise. Principles have the role of identifying the legally relevant\naspects of institutional practice. Principled consistency in this\nconception therefore consists in consistency in the morally relevant\nrespects of the practice. Principled consistency so understood has no\nroom for prior or residual concern about fidelity to the practice. The\npure interpretivist would say that, since it is not the case that we\ncompare moral ideals with some nonmoral code of norms constituted by\nthe content of institutional communication, the question does not\narise whether we ought to trade merit for consistency, to weaken our\nmorality to make it compatible with our history. Or whether we should\ntreat some ideal as a ground of obligation just because our\ninstitutions have not clearly said anything inconsistent with\nit. Since we ask in what ways institutional history is morally\nrelevant, the correct answer is determined by moral fact, not a moral\napproximation or an ideal diluted by history.  Yet the answer does not\ndescribe ideal arrangements\u2014those we should want to have,\nprescinding from institutional history\u2014but the normative\nsignificance of the arrangements we do have. So we shouldn\u2019t worry\nabout our morality being too perfect for our history, or not as\nperfect as our history might let us get away with, or about how to\nchoose between the two. We deploy morality, as is, not to compare it\nwith history but to find what difference history made.\n",
