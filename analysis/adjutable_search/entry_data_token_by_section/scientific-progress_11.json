    "main_text": "Theories of Scientific Progress || Knowledge and Understanding\n3.6 Knowledge and Understanding\n\nBird (2007) has defended the epistemic definition of progress\n(accumulation of knowledge) against the semantic conception\n(accumulation of true beliefs or succession of theories with\nincreasing verisimilitude). Here knowledge is not defined as justified\ntrue belief, but still it is taken to entail truth and justification,\nso that Bird\u2019s epistemic view in fact returns to the old\ncumulative model of progress. According to Bird, an accidentally true\nor truthlike belief reached by irrational methods without any\njustification does not constitute progress. This kind of thought\nexperiment may seem artificial, since there is always some sort of\njustification for any hypothetical theory which is accepted or at\nleast seriously considered by the scientific community. But\nBird\u2019s argument raises the important question whether\njustification is merely instrumental for progress (Rowbottom, 2008) or\nnecessary for progress (Bird, 2008). Another interesting question is\nwhether the rejection of unfounded but accidentally true beliefs is\nregressive. The truthlikeness approach replies to these problems by\ndistinguishing real progress RP and estimated progress EP:\njustification is not constitutive of progress in the sense of RP, but\nclaims of real progress can be justified by appealing to expected\nverisimilitude (Cevolani and Tambolo, 2013). On the other hand, the\nnotion of progress explicated by EP (or by the combination of RP and\nEP) is relative to evidence and justification but at the same time\nnon-cumulative.\n\nBird (2015) can reformulate his initial example by assuming that an\naccidentally true or truthlike theory \\(H\\) has been obtained by\nscientific but yet unreliable means, perhaps by derivation from an\naccepted theory which turns out to be false. Does such application of\nmistaken reasoning constitute progress? The interplay of RP and EP\nallows several possibilities here. Later evidence might show that the\ninitial estimate \\(ver(H\\mid e)\\) was too high. Or the Tr-value was in\nfact high but initially the ver-value was low (e.g. Aristarchus on\nheliocentric system, Wegener on continental drift) and only later it\nwas increased by new evidence.\n\nMost accounts of truthlikeness satisfy the principle that among true\ntheories truthlikeness covaries with logical strength (for an\nexception, see Oddie, 1986). So accumulation of knowledge is a special\ncase of increasing verisimilitude, but it does not cover the case of\nprogress by successive false theories. In his attempt to rehabilitate\nthe cumulative knowledge model of scientific progress, Bird admits\nthat there are historical sequences of theories none of which are\n\u201cfully true\u201d (e.g. Ptolemy\u2014Copernicus\u2014Kepler\nor Galileo\u2014Newton\u2014Einstein). As knowledge entails truth,\nBird tries to save his epistemic account by reformulating past false\ntheories as true ones. He proposes that if \\(g\\) is approximately\ntrue, then the proposition \u201capproximately \\(g\\)\u201d is true,\nso that \u201cthe improving precision of approximations can be an\nobject of knowledge\u201d. One problem with this treatment is that\nscientists typically formulate their theories as exact statements, and\nat the time of their proposal it is not known how large margins of\nerrors would be needed to transform them into true theories. With\nreference to Barrett (2008), Saatsi (2019) argues that the approximate\ntruth of Newtonian mechanics can be assessed only from the vantage\npoint of General Theory of Relativity, so that this knowledge was not\nepistemically accessible to Newton at his time. Further, many past\ntheories were radically false rather than approximately true or\ntruthlike, but still they could be improved by more truthlike\nsuccessors. Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric theory was rejected in the\nCopernican revolution, not retained in the form \u201capproximately\nPtolemy\u201d. Indeed, the progressive steps from Ptolemy to\nCopernicus or from Newton to Einstein are not only matters of improved\nprecision but involve changes in theoretical postulates and laws. A\nfurther problem for Bird\u2019s proposal is the question whether his\napproximation propositions are able to distinguish between progress\nand regress in science (Niiniluoto, 2014).\n\nDells\u00e9n (2016, 2018b) has formulated the noetic\naccount of scientific progress as increasing understanding. Using\nobjectual understanding instead of understanding-why, he characterizes\nunderstanding in terms of \u201cgrasping how to correctly explain and\npredict aspects of a given target\u201d. Against Bird (2007), who\ntakes understanding to be a species of knowledge of causes,\nDells\u00e9n argues that understanding does not require the\nscientists to have justification for, or even belief in, the\nexplanations or predictions they propose. Still, understanding is a\nmatter of degree. Thus, there are increases in scientific\nunderstanding without accumulation of scientific knowledge (e.g.\nEinstein\u2019s explanation of Brownian motion in terms of the\nkinetic theory of heat) and accumulation of scientific knowledge\nwithout increases in understanding (e.g. knowledge about random\nexperimental outcomes or spurious statistical correlations). The\nlatter thesis is easy to accept, especially if explanation needs laws,\nbut on the other hand the epistemic and truthlikeness approaches could\nagree that the collection of new important data may constitute\nscientific progress. The possibility of \u201cquasi-factive\u201d\nunderstanding by means of idealized theories (a common feature with\nthe verisimilitudinarian approach) is taken to be an advantage of the\nnoetic account. Park (2017) has challenged Dells\u00e9n\u2019s\nconclusions against the epistemic definition. He argues that\nscientific understanding involves beliefs that the explained phenomena\nare real and the confirmed predictions are true. He also argues that\nWegener\u2019s continental drift theory, which was not supported by\navailable evidence, was progressive, since it paved the way for the\nlater theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s. Dells\u00e9n (2018a)\nquestions Park\u2019s arguments by rejecting the \u201cmeans-end\nthesis\u201d, i.e., one should make the crucial distinction between\ncognitive and non-cognitive scientific progress and likewise\ndistinguish episodes that constitute and promote\nscientific progress.\n",
