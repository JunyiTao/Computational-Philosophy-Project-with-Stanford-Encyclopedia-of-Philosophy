    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || The \u201cradical conversion\u201d hypothesis\n2.3 The \u201cradical conversion\u201d hypothesis\n\nThere is clearly continuity between Collingwood\u2019s account of the\nnature of philosophical distinctions, as developed in An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method and his later claim in An Essay on\nMetaphysics that the role of presuppositional analysis is to undo\nthe conceptual knots in which unsystematic thinking gets tangled. His\nattempt to disambiguate the different senses of causation in An\nEssay on Metaphysics seems to be engaging in a task akin to what\nin An Essay on Philosophical Method he described as the\ndistinguishing of concepts that coincide in their instances. Yet a\nmajor issue of contention in Collingwood scholarship concerns whether\nCollingwood\u2019s later work, beginning with An Essay on\nMetaphysics, historicized his earlier conception of the role of\nphilosophical analysis. This is because An Essay on\nMetaphysics contains a fundamental ambiguity. On the one hand it\npresents presuppositional analysis as the task of regressing from\npropositional answers to questions and from questions to\npresuppositions. This is a logical task aimed at putting order in our\nthoughts and getting rid of conceptual confusions. On the other hand,\nit presents presuppositions as historical beliefs thereby suggesting\nthat the goal of presuppositional analysis is not so much to get rid\nof conceptual confusion as to describe what certain people believed in\ndifferent periods of time. Metaphysics, Collingwood says\n\n\nis the attempt to find out what absolute presuppositions have been\nmade by this or that person or group of persons, on this or that\noccasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that occasion\nor group of occasions, in the course of this or that piece of\nthinking. (EM 1998: 47)\n\n\nStatements such as these have a strong historicist flavour. This\nambiguity exposes a tension between two different conceptions of the\nrole of philosophical analysis. On the first conception the task of\nphilosophy is to delineate the subject matters of different forms of\nknowledge and denounce the encroachment of one form of knowledge on\nthe subject matter of another. The emphasis is on explanatory\npluralism, not historical relativism. The defence of the\nautonomy of historical explanation in The Idea of History,\nfor example, implies that the role of philosophical analysis is to\nidentify the distinctive presuppositions of history and to distinguish\nthem from those of natural science with a view to combating scientism.\nThe second conception, by contrast, places the emphasis on historical\nrelativism rather than explanatory pluralism. It is this second\nconception of the role of philosophical analysis in An Essay on\nMetaphysics that has led to the view that Collingwood\u2019s\nlater metaphilosophy differs substantially from his earlier view of\nthe role of philosophical analysis, a view sometimes referred to as\n\u201cthe radical conversion hypothesis\u201d. The hypothesis of a\nhistoricist turn was first advanced by Malcolm Knox in the editorial\nintroduction to the posthumously published The Idea of\nHistory. It was also endorsed by early commentators such as A.\nDonagan (1962 and 1972), Toulmin (1972) and N. Rotenstreich (1972).\nThe expression \u201cradical conversion hypothesis\u201d, however,\nwas actually coined by Rubinoff (1966) who alongside Mink (1969)\nrejected it as an inadequate description of Collingwood\u2019s\nposition. This is still a live debate in Collingwood scholarship,\nalthough more recent studies (Martin 1989; Modood 1989; Connelly 1990;\nOldfield 1995; Beaney 2005; D\u2019Oro 2002, 2010) tend to emphasise\nthe unity rather than discontinuity in Collingwood\u2019s\nmetaphilosophical approach.\n",
