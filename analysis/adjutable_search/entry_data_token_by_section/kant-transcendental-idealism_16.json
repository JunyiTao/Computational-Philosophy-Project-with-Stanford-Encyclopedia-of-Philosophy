These interpretations take the\ndistinction to be a metaphysical one between two different sets of\nproperties had by one and the same set of objects. These metaphysical\n\u201cdual aspect\u201d interpretations differ in exactly how they\nunderstand the distinction between these different sets of properties\n(see also Allais (2004, 2006, 2007, 2015); Rosefeldt (2007, 2013);\nMcDaniel (ms); and Marshall (2013)).\n\nPerhaps the most influential metaphysical but non-phenomenalist\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s idealism has been Langton (1998).\nLangton begins by pointing out that Kant thinks we are genuinely\nmissing out on something in not knowing things in themselves, and this\nsense of \u201cepistemic loss\u201d is incompatible with\nAllison\u2019s reading. As we saw in the previous section,\n\u201cAllisonian humility\u201d is apparently compatible with it\nbeing impossible that there are non-spatiotemporal objects and our\nforms of intuition being the only possible such forms. This\nloses Kant\u2019s sense that we are genuinely cognitively deprived,\nthat there is something about the world of which we are irremediably\nignorant (Allison responds to Langton\u2019s criticism in 2004:\n9\u201311).\n\nHaving rejected Allison\u2019s epistemic reading, Langton goes on to\ndiscuss a familiar tension between two of the central doctrines of\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism:\n\n(Existence) Things in themselves exist.\n\n(Humility) We cannot know anything about things in\nthemselves.\n\nLangton\u2019s solution to this, one of the oldest problems of Kant\nscholarship, is to interpret things in themselves as substances with\nintrinsic properties, and talk of \u201cphenomena\u201d as talk of\nthe extrinsic properties of those substances (things in themselves).\nSo in general,\n\n(1)\n Things in themselves are F = F is among the\nintrinsic properties of substances\n(2) \n Appearances are F = F is among the extrinsic\nproperties of substances\n\n\nIn particular, this allows Langton to interpret (Existence)\nand (Humility) as:\n\n(Existence*) Substances with intrinsic properties exist.\n\n(Humility*) We cannot cognize the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances.\n\nThe apparent tension between these doctrines has vanished.\nLangton\u2019s interpretation also allows her to explain why the\napparent tension between Humility and\n\n(Non-spatiality) Things in themselves are not spatial.\n\nis merely apparent because, on her reading (Non-spatiality) is\nequivalent to:\n\n(Non-spatiality*) Being spatial is not an intrinsic property\nof substances.\n\nThis is compatible with (Humility*) because we can know it merely by\nknowing that being spatial is an extrinsic property in general (thus\nis not an intrinsic property had by substances), and to know this we\ndo not need to know anything about the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances. Langton thus offers a consistent, elegant interpretation\nof transcendental idealism that solves several of the oldest and\nhardest problems in the interpretation of Kant\u2019s\n philosophy.[48]\n",
