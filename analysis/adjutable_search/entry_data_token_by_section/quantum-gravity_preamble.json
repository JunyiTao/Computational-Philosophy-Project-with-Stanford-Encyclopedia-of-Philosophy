    "main_text": "\n\nQuantum Gravity, broadly construed, is a physical theory (still\n\u2018under construction\u2019) incorporating both the principles of\ngeneral relativity and quantum theory. Such a theory is expected to be\nable to provide a satisfactory description of the microstructure of\nspacetime at the so-called\n Planck scale,\n at which all fundamental constants of the ingredient theories,\nc (the velocity of light in vacuo), \u210f (the reduced\nPlanck\u2019s constant), and G (Newton\u2019s constant), come\ntogether to form units of mass, length, and time. This scale is so\nremote from current experimental capabilities that the empirical\ntesting of quantum gravity proposals along standard lines is rendered\nnear-impossible.\n\nIn most, though not all, theories of quantum gravity, the\ngravitational field itself is also quantized. Since the contemporary\ntheory of gravity, general relativity, describes gravitation as the\ncurvature of spacetime by matter and energy, a quantization of gravity\nseemingly implies some sort of quantization of spacetime geometry:\nquantum spacetime. Insofar as all extant physical theories rely on a\nclassical (non-quantum) spacetime background, this presents not only\nextreme technical difficulties, but also profound methodological and\nontological challenges for the philosopher and the physicist. Though\nquantum gravity has been the subject of investigation by physicists\nfor almost a century, philosophers have only just begun to investigate\nits philosophical implications.\n",
