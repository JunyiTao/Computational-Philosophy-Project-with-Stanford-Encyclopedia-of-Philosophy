The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances (\u8af8\u6cd5\u5be6\u76f8 zhufashixiang)\n\nThe same method underlies all of Tiantai\u2019s shocking slogans,\nsuch as the claim that \u201call moments are permanent\u201d, as we\nhave seen, or \u201call appearances are the ultimate reality\u201d,\nor \u201cevil is ineradicable from the highest good,\nBuddhahood\u201d. They mean what they say, of course: no moment ever\nends, and however anything appears to anyone for however long is the\nultimate reality that all things emerge from, all things return to,\nthat explains and supports and sustains all things. True enough. The\nopposite would also be true. But these particular claims are\nemphasized in classical Tiantai writings to offset the more common\none-sided prejudices that tend the other way. Because the impermanence\nof things and the illusoriness of appearances is stressed in the rest\nof Buddhism, it is assumed that anyone getting to Tiantai will already\nbe aware of this side of reality, and indeed may be in danger of\nclinging to it. So Tiantai asserts the opposite, which is equally\ntrue.\n\nAll appearances are the ultimate reality: how is that true? Normally,\nwe believe that in some kind of appearance versus reality contrast:\n\u201cI thought that was a snake, but upon closer inspection it\nturned out to be a rope\u201d. This is what most of Buddhism also\nsays: \u201cI thought there was a self, but it turned out to be a\nbunch of impermanent aggregates\u201d. Or, \u201cI thought there was\na world, but it turned out to be all mind, or Buddha-nature, or\nillusion\u201d. Common sense assumes this too: the rim of my glass\nlooks oval, but in fact we know that, \u201creally\u201d, it is\nround\u2014it\u2019s just that we\u2019re seeing it from an angle\nthat foreshortens it. The rainbow is a mere appearance\u2014when we\ngo to touch it, we find nothing there. But the clouds and sunlight are\nreal, they are what it really is, what it turns out to really be.\nTiantai, however, makes the preposterous claim that the oval and the\ncircle are both true\u2014in fact, both are the ultimate reality, are\nfindable in all things and at all times and places, are the Absolute.\nThe rainbow and the cloudy sunlight\u2014both true, both absolutely\ntrue, both the Absolute. The \u201cself\u201d and the impermanent\naggregates\u2014both true, both absolutely true, both the Absolute.\nThe snake and the rope\u2014both true, both absolutely true, both the\nAbsolute. All is illusion. All is reality. Time is not an illusion.\nTime is the illusoriness of every possible thing. Time is a word that\nmeans \u201cwhatever you think is so is already not so\u201d. What\nis real? What you can go back to, look at again, check up on, verify,\nre-examine. But there is literally no experience that you can\ngo back to, so there is none that is real. What is illusion? Something\nthat turns out to be otherwise than it appears. There is no thing of\nwhich this is not the case. The horn \u201cappeared\u201d to be\nround, but \u201cturned out\u201d to be \u201csharp\u201d. But\nboth roundness and sharpness are equally unreal, equally real. Each is\ndetermined by the context in which it is seen. Taking the unnameable\nwhole into account, they too are unnameable, neither sharp nor round.\nRoundness and sharpness are two names for the same thing, which is\nround, sharp, and neither round nor sharp, and both round and\nsharp.\n",
