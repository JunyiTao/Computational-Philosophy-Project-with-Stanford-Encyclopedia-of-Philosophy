Conceptual Space, Distinctions, and Beyond Organisms\n\nResponses to the Focal Question have advanced discussion of at least\nthree closely related subsidiary questions:\n\n Beyond Organisms: In what ways does the traditional\nfocus on organisms hinder us in thinking about biological\nindividuals?\n Distinctions:  What are the most useful distinctions\nbetween various kinds of biological individuals?\n Conceptual Space: What is the most informative way to\narticulate the conceptual space surrounding the concept of biological\nindividuals?\n\n\nThe first of these questions anchors our discussion in the short\nhistory of thinking about biological individuals while acknowledging\nthe long past of the Focal Question. \n",
