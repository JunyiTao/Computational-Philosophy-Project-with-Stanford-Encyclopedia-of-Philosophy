From Constitutional Optimism to Alternatives for Social Change\n\nIn the aftermath of independence, most Hispanic American nations\nproduced written constitutions as early as 1811 in Venezuela, New\nGranada (subsequently Colombia), and Chile. At the time, political\nactors shared the belief that a written code of law had the power to\ntransform their societies in the direction of liberal ideas. They\nbelieved that good legislation was the way to promote individual\nliberties and economic progress. According to this, former subjects of\na colonial regime would come to see themselves as the bearers of\nindividual rights and liberties as soon as the latter were\nconstitutionally protected. Likewise, on this optimistic view,\neconomic progress would naturally develop as soon as individuals were\ngranted the economic freedoms to work, to contract, and to accumulate\nwealth. This initial constitutionalism did indeed bring great changes\nwith it: the constitutional protection of freedom of thought and of\nthe press ended the traditional limits on the free circulation of\nprinted materials and allowed for an explosion in the number of\nperiodical publications in which people for the first time openly\ndiscussed political issues. Nevertheless, the liberal legislation also\nfaced strong opposition by established social powers (such as the\nCatholic Church), the new republics were marked by great political\ninstability (regimes were often overthrown), and economic progress did\nnot materialize. By mid-century this initial constitutional optimism\nhad waned and political actors looked for alternative solutions. The\ntwo most salient liberal proposed alternatives went beyond\nconstitutionalism though in different ways. According to the first\none, it was necessary to transform social practices first in order to\nprepare society for republican institutions. According to the second\nproposal, by contrast, it was necessary to engage the State in the\ntask of social and economic reform. While the former alternative seeks\nto produce social transformation from below (in civil society), the\nlatter deepens the strategy of producing social change from above (by\nthe State). Juan Bautista Alberdi advocated the first kind of strategy\nas suitable for the specific situation of Argentina. In Mexico,\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora affirmed the second alternative\n(section 6).\n\nJuan Bautista Alberdi (1810\u20131884) was a public intellectual, a\nlegal theorist, and a diplomat. He laid the theoretical foundations\nfor the Argentinian constitution of 1853, which is the most long\nlasting liberal constitution of the period (still current albeit with\nimportant reforms). His proposal for constitutional reform in\nBases and starting points for the political organization of the\nArgentine republic (Bases y puntos de partida para la\norganizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la Rep\u00fablica\nArgentina, 1852) turns on two central ideas. The first one is\nthat the South American republics should lower their aspirations:\ninstead of a \u201ctrue\u201d democratic republic, they should aim\nfor a \u201cpossible\u201d one that would pave the way towards the\nformer. The second idea is that for a true democratic republic to have\nany chance of success, society must be ready for it. On his view, the\ntransformation of civil society must take place before granting\npolitical rights to the totality of the male adult population. Alberdi\nclaimed that the much needed social transformation could take place\nthrough the interaction of the local population with northern European\nimmigrants who would bring with them the habits of order, discipline,\nand industry that were necessary for economic progress and republican\ncitizenship. Strongly influenced by the effects of massive immigration\nin California, Alberdi maintained that South America could become\ncivilized through the transplantation of Northern European culture in\nAmerican soil. Thus, his proposed solution was to promote massive\nimmigration from northern Europe in a nation that was for the most\npart sparsely inhabited. Hence his famous claim that \u201cto govern\nis to populate\u201d.\n\nAlberdi\u2019s thinking was importantly influenced by the German\nhistorical school of law (Friedrich Karl von Savigny and his French\nfollower Eug\u00e8ne Lerminier) that repudiated both natural law and\nthe widely held idea that a society could be transformed on the basis\nof legislation that did not reflect its own state of civilization\n(Alberdi 1837). His distinction between a \u201cpossible\u201d and a\n\u201ctrue\u201d republic is based on the idea that political\norganization must not be oriented by high and utopian ideals, but must\nbe grounded in historical reality. On his view, law has to be adequate\nto the society that receives it. Since he also held that an\nexamination of the situation of the South American republicans shows\nthat they are not civilized enough to govern themselves through\ndemocratic institutions, he maintained that a possible republic should\nnot grant equal political rights to all citizens. He favored a sort of\ngovernment that was republican in form, but highly authoritarian in\npractice. This, he thought, was apt in light of what he considered the\nhistorical reality of Hispanic America. He famously referred\napprovingly to Bol\u00edvar\u2019s dictum that \u201cThe new\nstates of formerly Spanish America need kings with the name of\npresident\u201d (Alberdi 1852: 415). In the end, he favored a\ncombination of federalism with political centralism: a certain degree\nof autonomy to the provinces combined with a strong executive, since,\non his view, both federalism and centralism had important historical\nroots in South America.\n\nAccording to Alberdi, the goals that should guide the political\norganization of a possible South American Republic must be responsive\nto the latter\u2019s history and state of civilization (i.e., level\nof material and political progress), which establish the limits of\npolitical possibility. On his view, the most important goal of a\npossible republic is to educate the population for representative\ndemocracy. By \u201ceducation\u201d he meant the improvement of the\nlocal population\u2019s level of civilization up to the level\nrequired for a true republic. He advocated two main means of\ncivilization: the promotion of commerce and industry, on the one hand,\nand massive European immigration, on the other. Alberdi opposed the\nidea that the population could be made fit for democracy through\nformal schooling, as many other liberals indeed maintained. Domingo\nSarmiento, the other dominant intellectual and political figure in\nArgentina at the time, favored formal schooling as the main means of\ncivilization (Sarmiento 1849; Botana 1997). By contrast with\nSarmiento, however, Alberdi held that the best means of moralization\nwere industrious work and the constant interaction with people who\nalready had the habits of order, discipline, and industry. In passages\nthat evince the influence of Adam Smith, he maintained that social\nprosperity was not the work of governments, but a spontaneous result.\nHe was completely skeptical about the possibility of civilizing the\nlocal population without the interaction with people who were already\ncivilized. He summarily remarked that \u201cwhatever is not European\nin America is barbaric.\u201d\n\nAlberdi\u2019s diagnosis about the best means for preparing the\npopulation for a true republic guides his recommendations for\nlegislation. At the heart of his liberalism is his strong defense of\nfree trade and industry. Such a defense was grounded on both economic\nand moral considerations: he regarded freedom of trade and industry as\ninstrumental for material progress and for the improvement of the\nmorals of the local population. Crucially, freedom of trade and\nindustry was also indispensable in order to attract the desired sort\nof European immigrants. The protection of civil rights and liberties\nto everyone was part of his conception of a possible republic but also\ninstrumental for promoting immigration. Though he favored religious\ntoleration in order to attract non-Catholic Europeans, he also\nmaintained that Catholicism should remain the official religion. On\nthis point, he differed from most Hispanic American liberals who not\nonly advocated the end of the official recognition of Catholicism but\nalso, in some cases, the separation between Church and state. Again,\nAlberdi\u2019s views were grounded on the realities of the\nArgentinian nation where the Catholic Church was relatively weak and\ndid not pose a political threat to the republic in the making. In this\nrespect, the situation in Mexico and Colombia was completely\ndifferent.\n",
