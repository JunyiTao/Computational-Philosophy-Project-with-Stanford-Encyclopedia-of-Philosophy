    "main_text": "Interpretation and Understanding\n11. Humanity\n\nThe topics examined so far all have their anthropological\nimplications. Hamann\u2019s critique of the socio-political\nimplications of Kant\u2019s vision of \u2018enlightenment\u2019\nrests on a conviction about our social and political destiny. Hamann\nsees our socio-political vocation as consisting firstly in\n\u2018criticism\u2019 (or \u2018critique\u2019)\u2014recognizing\nand appropriating, or hating and rejecting, the true vs. the false,\ngood vs. evil, beautiful vs. ugly; and secondly in\n\u2018politics\u2019, which is increasing or reducing them. This is\nnot the prerogative of the ruler; every one is at once their own\n\u2018king\u2019, their own \u2018legislator\u2019; but also the\n\u2018first-born of their subjects\u2019. It is our\n\u201crepublican privilege\u201d to contribute to this destiny,\n\u201cthe critical and magisterial office of a political\nanimal\u201d (N III, 38\u201339).\n\nThe concepts of knowledge and language and their many facets also\nimply a particular anthropology: the diversity yet integration of the\nhuman being. For Hamann, the truest picture of humanity is of\ndiversity in unity; a number of different, often contrasting aspects\nand features together composing the human person. Hamann consequently\ndid not confine his attention to epistemology and reason when\nconsidering what human beings are, and passion, the thirst for\nvengeance, and sexual ecstasy form a part of his picture as well. (In\nresponse to the Enlightenment aesthetic of art as the imitation of\n\u2018beautiful nature\u2019, Hamann\u2019s ironic observation was:\n\u201cThe thirst for vengeance was the beautiful nature which Homer\nimitated\u201d (ZH 2, 157:12).)\n\nThe theme of interdependence between human beings, which was\nemphasized in his epistemology, also has its roots in his\nunderstanding of what it is to be human. We are not self-sufficient;\nbut for Hamann, even our lacks and failings have a positive thrust,\nthis signifier of dependency making us all the more suited for the\nenjoyment of nature and one another.\n\nIf there is a fundamental key to his thinking on humanity, it is the\nidea that the human being is the image of God. This is admittedly more\ntheological than philosophical, but is essential for understanding\nHamann\u2019s philosophical anthropology. Hamann\u2019s treatment of\nthis perennial theme is hardly conventional in the history of\nChristian thinking. While the experience of sinfulness and wickedness\nis a powerful theme, particularly in his earlier, post-conversion\nwriting, the fundamental thrust of his thinking is the easy exchange\nbetween the human and the divine. In this exchange, language is\n\u201cthe sign, symbol and pledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible\nbut all the more intimate union, participation and community of divine\nenergies and ideas\u201d (N III, 32:21\u201324). Despite his\nreputation for being an irrationalist, reasoning too relates us to\nGod; God, nature and reason are described as having the same relation\nas light, the eye and what we see, or as author, text and reader (ZH\n5, 272:14\u201316).\n\nOne must also remember that Hamann confessed that he could not\nconceive of a Creative Spirit without genitalia; indeed, he was quite\nhappy to assert that the genitals are the unique bond between creature\nand Creator. So sexuality in divine-human relations has two aspects.\nFirst, as paradigm of creativity, it is the way in which our\nGod-likeness can most strikingly be seen. Secondly, as the point of\nthe most profound unity, it is the locus for our union both with\nanother human being and with the divine. Provocatively, Hamann sees\noriginal sin and its rebellion as embodied not in sexuality, but in\nreason. Overweening reason is our attempt to be like God; meanwhile,\nprudery is the rejection of God\u2019s image, while trying to be like\nGod in the wrong sense (bodilessness). (See Essay of a Sibyl on\nMarriage and Konxompax.) One should therefore distinguish\n\u2018likeness to God\u2019 from \u2018being equal to God\u2019.\nIn the Sibyl\u2019s essay, the male version of grasping at equality\nwith God (cf. Phil. 2:6) is the attempt to be self-sufficient, to be\nthe God of monotheism: the sole ruler, who possesses self-existence.\nInstead, the encounter with the opposite sex should engender in the\nman an attitude of profound respect towards the woman\u2019s body, as\nthe source of his own existence, from his mother. As the source of his\nown joy, lovemaking also is an acknowledgement of his own dependence,\nhis lack of self-sufficiency and autonomy. But this dependence on\nanother paradoxically is the Godlikeness of the Creator, the father,\nthe one who humbles himself in self-giving (a favourite Hamannian\ntheme in his discussion of God). Meanwhile, the woman\u2019s\ntemptation is to an artificial innocence; a secret envy of God\u2019s\nincorporeality and impassibility. The defence of one\u2019s virginity\nis another cryptic attempt at self-sufficiency. Instead, the woman\nmust brave the \u2018tongues of fire\u2019 in a \u2018sacrifical\noffering of innocence\u2019, in order to realize her Godlikeness;\nwhich is not to be found in bodilessness and the absence of passion,\nbut in passionate creativity; in the willingness to be incarnate.\nThus, if human beings are in the image of God, it is a trinitarian\nimage of God, a mutual relation of love of \u2018Father\u2019,\n\u2018Son\u2019 and \u2018Spirit\u2019; found in creating, in\nsaving, and in tongues of fire.\n",
