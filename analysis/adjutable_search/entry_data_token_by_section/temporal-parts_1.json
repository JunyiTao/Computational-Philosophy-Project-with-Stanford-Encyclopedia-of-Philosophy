What are temporal parts, and which things are supposed to have them?\n\nThe two most popular accounts of persistence are perdurance theory\n(perdurantism) and endurance theory (endurantism). Perdurantists\nbelieve that ordinary things like animals, boats and planets have\ntemporal parts (things persist by \u2018perduring\u2019).\nEndurantists believe that ordinary things do not have temporal parts;\ninstead, things are wholly present whenever they exist (things persist\nby \u2018enduring\u2019). This looks like a straightforward\nontological disagreement, a dispute about what exists. Perdurantists\nthink that objects have both spatial and temporal parts, while\nendurantists think that they only have spatial parts.\n\nFrom an endurantist point of view, however, it is difficult even to\nsay what temporal parts are supposed to be. Your temporal parts are\nparts of you which lie in the past or in the future. But endurantists\nagree that you have different spatial parts at different times: you\nexchange molecules with the environment, you grow new hairs or lose a\ntooth to decay. So, yes, some of your (former) parts lie in the past,\nand some of your (future) parts lie in the future, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re somehow less than a whole person,\nright here and now. Why do perdurantists make such a big deal of the\nobvious fact that you have different parts at different times?\n\nEndurantists think about what parts you have at different times, past,\npresent or future. But perdurantists prefer to think atemporally about\nwhat parts you have, full stop (what parts you have, period). And they\nclaim that you have you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow amongst\nyour parts. Endurantists don\u2019t accept this atemporal way of\ntalking about parthood, and so they find it difficult even to say what\nthey don\u2019t like about temporal parts.\n\nWhat moral should we draw from this communication breakdown? Some\nperdurantists think \u2018so much the worse for endurantists: they\ncan\u2019t even say what they\u2019re against\u2019. Some\nendurantists think \u2018so much the worse for perdurantists: their\ntheory doesn\u2019t even make sense\u2019. And some philosophers on\nboth sides look for a neutral way to spell out the notion of a\ntemporal part (for more detail on this, see the reading suggestions at\nthe end of this section). For now, let\u2019s take it that the basic\nidea of a temporal part is well-enough understood, perhaps via the\nanalogy with spatial parts; later sections will show how the idea is\nput to work.\n\nSo the two standard views of persistence are endurance and perdurance\ntheories. But there are also non-standard views.\u00a0 According to\nmixed views, some persisting objects have temporal parts, and others\ndo not. For example, perhaps changing objects have temporal parts,\nwhilst objects with unchanging intrinsic natures do not. Or perhaps\nontologically self-sufficient things like organisms don\u2019t have\ntemporal parts, but ontologically dependent things like ocean waves,\nsmiles or universities do. (Most endurantists, perdurantists and\nothers agree that processes or events have temporal parts: whether or\nnot I have earlier and later parts, my birthday party certainly\ndoes.)\n\nOther non-standard views take the basic perdurantist idea that\npersistence is much like spatial extension, then they develop the idea\nin different ways. For example, perhaps persisting things stretch out\nfour-dimensionally through time, but without being subdivided into\ntemporal parts. Or perhaps, as stage theorists claim, the world is\nfull of four-dimensional objects with temporal parts, but when we talk\nabout ordinary objects like boats and people, we talk about brief\ntemporal parts or \u2018stages\u2019 of four-dimensional\nobjects.\n\nHow is this supposed to work? Imagine that someone refers to you by\nname. According to perdurantists, the name refers to a\nninety-year-long (let\u2019s hope) four-dimensional object. According\nto stage theorists, the name refers to a brief part of that\nninety-year-long object, a different one at different times. This\nsounds peculiar: after all, your name refers to you and you have a\nfuture (and quite a past), while stages exist only momentarily. Stage\ntheorists say that when we speculate about what you\u2019re going to\ndo next week, our speculations are made true or false by the behaviour\nof your counterparts next week. These future counterparts of yours are\nthe very objects which, according to perdurantists, are your future\ntemporal parts.\n\nJust how brief are temporal parts or stages? Typically, objects which\nhave any temporal parts are thought to have instantaneous temporal\nparts (\u2018time-slices\u2019), which do not themselves persist\nthrough time. (Most perdurantists think that things have\nnon-instantaneous temporal parts too, like you-during-1999.) But an\nalternative is to claim that an object has only as many temporal parts\nas it has genuinely differentiated periods in its existence; this is a\nmixed view, because changing objects will have temporal parts, while\nunchanging objects and temporal parts will persist without having\ntemporal parts of their own.\n\nSome philosophers and some non-philosophers suspect that debate about\nwhether things have temporal parts is empty, that there is no genuine\nissue at stake here. One idea is that we can\u2019t know for sure\nwhether things have temporal parts: all the theories on offer have\ngood and bad aspects and we\u2019ll never find an undisputed\nchampion. If this is true, it doesn\u2019t undermine the debate\nunless consensus and certainty are our only goals. A second idea is\nthat metaphysical enquiry is pointless, since irrelevant to daily\nlife. This claim needs support from accounts of relevance, and of the\nconnection between irrelevance and pointlessness. A third idea is that\nmetaphysical enquiry is doomed to fail because there are no absolute\nmetaphysical truths. This claim needs support from accounts of truth,\nlanguage and reality. All of these topics are too grand for this\narticle. A fourth idea is the much more focused claim that, while\ncertain metaphysical disputes are legitimate, the debate about\ntemporal parts is empty: this doubt may be reinforced by the\ndifficulty of giving a neutral account of what temporal parts are\nsupposed to be, or by scepticism about the so-called \u2018problem of\nchange\u2019, as discussed in the next section.\n\nAs noted above, the debate between endurantists and perdurantists is\nan ontological dispute: do temporal parts of ordinary material objects\nexist, or not? Moreover the endurantist notion of \u2018being wholly\npresent\u2019 was understood in terms of parts and wholes. In the\npast few years, however, some have suggested that debates about\npersistence are better understood as debates about location \u2013\nhow are material objects located in (or extended through) time, and\nhow does this compare with the way(s) in which material objects are\nlocated in (or extended through) space? Temporal parts were introduced\nat the beginning of this entry via an analogy with spatial parts, but\nthis recent work challenges even the assumption that\nspatially-extended objects inevitably have spatial parts. The present\narticle focuses, appropriately enough, on persistence questions\nunderstood via the notion of temporal parthood, but you can read about\nalternative approaches in the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology,\n especially section 6.3.2.\n\nBefore we plunge into arguments about whether temporal parts exist,\nit\u2019s worth clarifying some terminology. First: perdurance theory\nis sometimes called \u2018worm theory\u2019, especially when it is\ncontrasted with stage theory. This is because perduring objects\nstretch out through time just as (we all agree) earthworms stretch out\nthrough space. Worm theory has nothing to do with wormholes, and,\nsadly, people don\u2019t usually describe themselves as \u2018worm\ntheorists\u2019. Second: \u2018four-dimensionalism\u2019 is\nsometimes used as an umbrella term for perdurance theory and stage\ntheory, and \u2018three-dimensionalism\u2019 as a name for endurance\ntheory. This is because perduring objects (and sums of stages) are\nfour-dimensional, whereas enduring objects are three-dimensional,\nwholly present at each moment. But some non-standard views of\npersistence, including \u2018mixed\u2019 views, do not fall neatly\ninto either category. And beware: other authors use\n\u2018four-dimensionalism\u2019 and\n\u2018three-dimensionalism\u2019 as names for different theories of\ntime, rather than different theories of things in time. Third:\n\u2018continuant\u2019 is sometimes used as a neutral term for any\nordinary persisting thing. In this sense, we can ask whether\ncontinuants endure or perdure. But the label \u2018continuant\u2019\nis more commonly reserved for enduring, three-dimensional objects.\nThis marks a contrast with processes or events, and carries the\nimplication that perdurantists foolishly identify material objects\nwith events. So it tends only to be endurantists who use the term\n\u2018continuant\u2019.\n\nSuggested Reading: good introductions to the debate\nabout temporal parts include Loux (1998, chapter 6), Haslanger (2003),\nMcGrath (2007), Sider (2008), Effingham (2009), Balashov (2011),\nEffingham (2012), Goswick (2013), and Curtis and Robson (2016: chapter\n7). Amongst the more recent contributions, Effingham (2009), Goswick,\nand Curtis and Robson are good on the basics; Effingham (2012) is more\ndetailed and comprehensive; Balashov (2011) is more advanced, guided\nby relativistic physics. Lewis (1986a, p. 202) introduces the terms\n\u2018endurance\u2019 and \u2018perdurance\u2019, attributing them\nto Johnston. Sider (1997; 2001, section 3.3) discusses the difficulty\nof defining \u2018temporal part\u2019; see also Merricks (1999a),\nHawley (2001, section 1.6) and McKinnon (2002). Wasserman (2016)\nargues that we often conflate the ontological question whether things\nhave temporal parts with the explanatory question whether things\npersist in virtue of having those parts. Donnelly (2016) is a very\nhelpful exploration of different attempts to define endurance \u2013\nin terms of parthood, or location, or grounding. Lewis (1976,\npostscript B) tries to make the notion of a temporal part acceptable\nto endurantists; van Inwagen (2000) and Noonan (2003a) object, whilst\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller (2004) respond. Perdurantists include\nQuine (1950; 1960), Taylor (1955), Lewis (1971; 1976; 1986a),\nArmstrong (1980), Noonan (1980), Robinson (1982), Heller (1984; 1990),\nLe Poidevin (1991), Jubien (1993), and Hudson (2001). Endurantists\ninclude Thomson (1965; 1983), Geach (1966; 1967), Chisholm (1976),\nMellor (1980; 1981; 1998), Lowe (1983; 1998b), Simons (1987), Forbes\n(1987), Haslanger (1989a), van Inwagen (1990a; 1990b), Oderberg\n(1993), Merricks (1994), Fine (2008/2006), and Shoemaker (2015);\nSimons (2008) responds to Fine. Miller (2005b) defines\n\u2018endurance\u2019, see also Keinanen and Hakkarainen (2010),\nwhile Janzen (2011) defends endurantism. Melia (2000) eliminates\nprocesses in favour of enduring things. Johnston (1987) explores a\nmixed view, and so, differently, do Hofweber and Velleman (2011),\nGrygianiec (2016), and Brzozowski (2017, 2019). Parsons (2000)\ndevelops four-dimensionalism without temporal parts, and Miller (2009)\ndevelops this further. See also Daniels (2019). Other non-standard\naccounts of persistence include Giordani and Costa (2013), Miller\n(2013), Costa (2017), and Giberman (2019b). For stage theory see Sider\n(1996; 2001) and Hawley (2001); Varzi (2003) is a sympathetic\ndiscussion, whilst Balashov (2007) attempts a precise definition of\n\u2018exdurance\u2019 aka stage theory. Moyer (2008), Moss (2012)\nand Viebahn (2013) compare stage theory with perdurantism. More on\nstage theory: Stuchlik (2003), Hansson Wahlberg (2008), Wright (2010),\nRychter (2012), McKeever (2017) and Giberman (2019a). Questions about\nhow fine-grained temporal parts or stages must be are discussed by Le\nPoidevin (2000), Stuchlik (2003), Traynor (2013), Effingham (2013),\nMazzola (2015), Kleinschmidt (2017), and Giberman (2019a); Leonard\n(2018) explores endurantism without temporal instants. Cahen (2017)\ndiscusses individuation for temporal parts.\n\nFor arguments that there is no real dispute here, see McCall and Lowe\n(2003), Lowe and McCall (2004), and Miller (2005); Reydon (2008)\nresponds by drawing analogies with debate about biological species.\nHirsch (2008) shows how more general scepticism about metaphysical\ndisputes might play out here; McGrath (2007) draws out a number of\nconnections with the burgeoning literature on metaontology; see also\nBenovsky (2011), Hansson Wahlberg (2014b), and Giberman (2018). The\nrole of intuitions and \u2018folk theory\u2019 in debate about\npersistence is discussed by Rose (2015), Benovsky (2016), and Rose et\nal (2018); the role of experience as evidence is discussed by Prosser\n(2012), Traynor (2014), Prosser (2015) and Young (2018). Scholl (2007)\nconnects the philosophy and psychology of object persistence.\nHawthorne (2006, 2008) explores the distinction between three- and\nfour-dimensionalism (the second of these articles is the more\naccessible). For discussion of how to define \u2018wholly\npresent\u2019, see Wasserman (2004a), Crisp and Smith (2005), Olson\n(2006), and Donnelly (2016). Cotnoir\u2019s (2015) review of\nKleinschmidt (2014) highlights issues about persistence and location;\nKleinschmidt\u2019s introduction is very useful,and provides further\nreferences; see also Eagle (2016a). Donnelly (2011) advocates the\nlocation approach, articulated in Parsons (2007); for further\nreferences see the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology,\n especially section 6.3.2. Steward (2015) discusses continuants. The\npresent encyclopedia article focuses on contemporary debate in analytic\nphilosophy; work which makes connections to other times and other\ntraditions includes Hirsch (1999a), Helm (2009), Gorham (2010), Fan\n(2018), McKeever (2018), Costa (2020) and Hayashi (2019).\n",
