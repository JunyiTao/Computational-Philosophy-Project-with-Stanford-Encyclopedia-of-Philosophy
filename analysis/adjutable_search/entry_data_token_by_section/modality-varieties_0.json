    "main_text": "Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality\n1. Epistemic and Metaphysical Modality\n\nThere are many ways the world could have been. You could have gotten\nup later today. Your parents could have failed to meet, so that you\nwere never born. Life could never have developed on earth. The history\nof the universe could even have been completely different from the\nbeginning. And many philosophers believe that the laws of nature could\nhave been different as well (although that has been denied, as\ndiscussed in\n section 2).\n Maximally specific ways the world could have been are commonly called\n\u2018possible worlds.\u2019 The apparatus of possible worlds allows\nus to introduce a set of modal notions: a proposition is necessary\njust in case it is true in all possible worlds, a proposition is\npossible just in case it is true in some possible worlds, and it is\ncontingent just in case it is true in some but not all possible\nworlds. A sentence is necessary (possible, contingent) just\nin case it expresses a necessary (possible, contingent)\nproposition.\n\nThe modal notions considered in the last paragraph are not obviously\nepistemological. On the face it, we are not reporting a fact about\nwhat is or can be known or believed by anyone when we say that life\ncould have failed to develop. But there is also a family of modal\nconcepts that are clearly epistemological. These are the notions we\nemploy when we say things like \u2018Fred must have stolen\nthe book (the evidence shows conclusively that he did it),\u2019 or\n\u2018Mary cannot be in London (she would have called\nme).\u2019 These modal utterances seem to make claims about what the\navailable evidence shows, or about which scenarios can be ruled out on\nthe basis of the evidence. More formally, we can say that a\nproposition \\(P\\) is epistemically necessary for an agent A\njust in case the empirical evidence \\(A\\) possesses and ideal\nreasoning (i.e., reasoning unrestricted by cognitive limitations) are\nsufficient to rule out \\({\\sim}P\\). This notion of epistemic necessity\nis agent-relative: one and the same claim can be epistemically\nnecessary for one agent, but not for another agent with less empirical\nevidence. We obtain a notion of epistemic necessity of particular\nphilosophical interest by focusing on a limiting case, namely that of\na possible agent with no empirical evidence\n whatsoever.[1]\n A proposition \\(P\\) is epistemically necessary for such an agent just\nin case ideal reasoning alone, unaided by empirical evidence, is\nsufficient to rule out \\({\\sim}P\\). A proposition that meets this\ncondition can be called a priori in at least one sense of\nthis term, or we can call it simply epistemically necessary\n(without relativization to an agent). Propositions that are not a\npriori are called a\n posteriori.[2]\n\nIt is an important and controversial question whether the necessary\npropositions are all and only the epistemically necessary (a\npriori) ones, or whether the extensions of the two concepts can\ncome apart. One possible reason for thinking that the notions are\ncoextensive derives from a very natural picture of information and\ninquiry. On this picture, all information about the world is\ninformation about which of all possible worlds is realized (i.e.,\nabout where in the space of all possible worlds the actual world is\nlocated). My total information about the world can be identified with\nthe set of possible worlds that I cannot rule out on the basis of my\nempirical evidence and ideal reasoning. As I gather more and more\nempirical evidence, I can progressively narrow down the range of\npossibilities. Suppose, for example, that I am ignorant of the current\nweather conditions. The worlds compatible with my evidence include\nsome where the weather is good and others where it is bad. A look out\nof the window at the rain provides information about the matter. I can\nnow narrow down the set of possibilities by excluding all possible\nworlds with fine weather. On this account, a proposition \\(P\\) is\nepistemically necessary for \\(A\\) just in case \\(P\\) is true\nin all possible worlds that cannot be ruled out on the basis of\n\\(A\\)\u2019s empirical evidence and ideal reasoning. \\(P\\) is a\npriori just in case it is epistemically necessary for a possible\nagent who has no empirical evidence. Since such an agent cannot rule\nout any possible worlds, a proposition is a priori just in\ncase it is true in all possible worlds. In other words, the a\npriori propositions are all and only the necessary\n propositions.[3]\n\nThis approach is often combined with a certain account of semantic\ncontent. One of the main purposes of language is to transmit\ninformation about the world. Where \\(P\\) is any sentence used for that\npurpose (roughly speaking, a declarative sentence), it seems natural\nto think of \\(P\\)\u2019s content (the proposition expressed by it) as\nthe information that is semantically encoded in it. Combining this\nwith the foregoing account of information, we can think of the content\nof a sentence as a set of possible worlds (namely, the set containing\njust those worlds of which the sentence is true) or, equivalently, as\na function from worlds to truth-values.\n\nThis picture connects the modal, epistemic and semantic realms in a\nsimple and elegant way, and various versions of it have informed the\nwork of numerous contemporary philosophers (including David Lewis,\nRobert Stalnaker, David Chalmers, and Frank Jackson). However, the\napproach has come under pressure from data to be considered in the\nnext section.\n",
