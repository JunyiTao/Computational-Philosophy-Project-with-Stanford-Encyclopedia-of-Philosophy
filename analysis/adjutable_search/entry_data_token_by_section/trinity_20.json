    "main_text": "Four-self, No-self, and Indeterminate Self Theories || Persons as Relational Qua-Objects\n3.3 Persons as Relational Qua-Objects\n\nRob Koons (2018) constructs an account inspired by Aquinas, Augustine,\nand recent work on \u201cqua-objects\u201d by Fine and by Asher.\nFollowing the latter, Koons understands \u201cqua-modified\nnoun phrases as picking out intentional objects consisting of\ntropes or accidents, metaphysical parts of the base object\u201d\n(346). Koons holds that even everyday objects imply the existence of\nsuch intentional objects, i.e. things that can be thought. Thus, we\ncan distinguish Trump-qua-husband from Trump-qua-President; while\nthese are real objects of thought, they both amount to being\nproperties of Trump, which Koons thinks of as metaphysical parts of\nDonald Trump.\n\nUnlike most of the other theories in this entry, Koons builds his on\nthe foundation of divine simplicity, traditionally understood.\nAccording to this, God is numerically identical with his nature, his\none action, and his existence. God has no accidental (non-essential)\nproperties and no proper parts, and he just is any essential property\nof his. In sum, God has no parts or components in any sense (339).\nWhile one might suppose that this would rule out God being a Trinity,\nKoons argues that to the contrary, we can understand how and why God\nis a Trinity by \u201clocating God in an extreme and exotic region of\nlogical space\u201d (ibid.)\n\nThe divine nature just is any divine attribute, e.g. omnipotence. In\naddition, Koons argues that the divine nature just is \u201can\nintentional relation: namely, perfect knowledge and perfect\nlove.\u201d. Understanding or knowledge generally should be\nunderstood \u201cas an internal relation between the mind\nand its external object.\u201d (340).\n\nFollowing Aquinas, Koons says that God (a.k.a. the divine nature)\nunderstands all things through himself; God is essentially omniscient\nand essentially self-understanding. Thus, the divine nature implies\nthe existence of three relational qua-objects, which are the Persons\nof the Trinity. These are not merely three ways we can think of God,\nor three ways God may appear to us, but rather these objects result\nfrom God\u2019s essential self-understanding (345). Each of\nthese four things\u2013God (the divine nature), the Father, the Son,\nand the Spirit\u2013has the divine nature as its one metaphysical\ncomponent, and each has all the divine attributes (346). Each of those\nfour is numerically distinct from each of the three others (347).\n\nThe theory requires more than the relation of (absolute) numerical\nsameness or identity. In addition, Koons defines a relation of\n\u201creal\u201d sameness. Like identity, this relation is reflexive\nand symmetrical, but unlike identity it is neither transitive nor\nEuclidian (such that if any x is related to some y and to some z then\nthis implies that y and z are related in that same way). Thus, real\nsameness is not an equivalence relation (348, 357 n. 5) According to\nthis theory each Person is really the same as the divine nature (God),\nbut not identical to him. But no Person here is really the same as any\nother Person; all three are really distinct from one another. To\nsummarize: there are four divine realities on this model of the\nTrinity. The three Persons are so many qua-objects, while God is not.\nNone of these four is really distinct from God; all are really the\nsame as him. Yet none of the four is identical to any of the others\n(348).\n\nOne may ask why there should be only three qua-objects here, when\nobjects like a human person or an apple, having many properties, might\nimply hundreds or thousands of qua-objects. The answer is that not\nevery qua-object of God is a divine Person. Many such, Koons says, are\ncontingent, e.g. God-as-creator, or God-as-friend-of-Abraham; such\nwould not have existed had God not created. And any qua-object of God\nwhich involves only an essential property of his, e.g.\nGod-as-omnipotent, is numerically identical to God (345). To be a\n\u201chypostatic qua-object\u201d (i.e. a God-as-thing which is a\ndivine Person) something must exist necessarily, be numerically\ndistinct from God, and be such that \u201cIt is not wholly grounded\nin a logical or conceptual way on any other divine qua-object\nor objects. So, it must be fully determinate (non-general,\nnon-disjunctive, and non-negative) in its definition\u201d (346).\nThis last condition is meant to prevent the proliferation of divine\nqua-objects (354\u20136). Koons argues that this account explains why\nthere are exactly three divine Persons.\n\nMy main claim is that, as a matter of metaphysical necessity, there\nare exactly three hypostatic qua-objects (namely, Father,\nSon, and Spirit, as defined above). This is because there are only two\nintrinsic, relational properties of God (knowing and being known), and\nthese give rise (on purely logical grounds) to only three\nnon-disjunctive combinations. (346)\n\n\nDivine love doesn\u2019t imply further Persons because it\u2019s the\nsame relational property as divine self-knowing. God-as-knower\nisn\u2019t numerically the same as God-as-known because of the\nessential asymmetry of the knowing relation (ibid.). Divine\nlove, Koons says, is a kind of charity of friendship; thus, lover and\nbeloved can\u2019t be numerically identical. So if the Father loves\nthe Son, this implies that they are numerically distinct\n(non-identical). It also implies that they are really distinct and not\nreally the same. In specifying what he means by real distinctness\nKoons writes,\n\nTwo qua-objects with the same ultimate base are really\ndistinct if and only if they are numerically distinct and the\ndistinction between them is intrinsic to their ultimate base.\n(348)\n\n\nThe distinction between these qua-objects Father and Son is intrinsic\nto their ultimate base, God (the divine nature) because he is the\nintrinsic yet relational property of love (348\u20139). This has the\nconsequence that \u201cthe divine nature cannot love or be loved by\nany of the divine Persons\u201d (351).\n\nKoons argues that this theory has many advantages over some rivals.\nAgainst the constitution based three-self theory of Brower and Rea\n(see section\n 2.1.3),\n it allows for divine simplicity, as the Trinity does not involve any\nmetaphysical components or parts other than the divine nature. And he\nclaims that their account amounts to tritheism, \u201csince each\nPerson is divine in His own unique and incomparable way\u201d. In\ncontrast, on Koons\u2019s theory, \u201ceach of the three Persons is\ndivine in the same way\u2013simply by being a divine\nqua-object, and the divine nature is complete and fully\ndivine in itself\u201d. Again, Koons\u2019s theory can, and theirs\ncan\u2019t, explain why there are exactly three divine Persons. And\ntheir theory requires three different odd and hard to explain personal\nattributes (352). As contrasted with any \u201csocial\u201d theory,\nthis one doesn\u2019t have divine Persons which are really distinct\nfrom the divine nature (God) (353).\n\nKoons recognizes that many will object that this theory is\ntetratheism; it features four realities, each of which is divine;\nprima facie, these would be four gods. Koons believes that the real\nsameness of each of the Persons with God should rule out any\npolytheism and rule in monotheism. He offers this definition of\nmonotheism:\n\nThere is one and only one thing such that no divine being is really\ndistinct from it (348).\n\n\nThis would be equivalent to:\n\nThere is one and only one thing such that every divine being is really\nthe same as it.\n\n\nBut a \u201cdivine being\u201d is a god. Thus the meaning of this\ndefinition can be restated as:\n\nThere is one and only one thing such that every god is really the same\nas it. Or: There is one and only one thing such that no god is really\ndistinct from it.\n\n\nThis is a controversial definition; one may think that Koons simply\nredefines \u201cmonotheism\u201d as compatible with any number of\ngods greater than zero. Put differently, one may count things by\nidentity. Why can\u2019t one also count gods in this way? Again, if a\nis a god, and b is a god, and they are non-identical, what is it about\n\u201creal sameness\u201d that implies that they\u2019re really the\nsame god? Why isn\u2019t this an ad hoc, theory-saving\ndefinition?\n\nOne may wonder here how the four realities can be equally divine. It\nwould seem that whereas God (the divine nature) would not exist\nbecause of any other, and so would exist a se, each of the\nqua-object persons would exist because of God, their base.\nWouldn\u2019t this make God greater than each of the Persons? Again,\non this account each of these four is intrinsically and essentially\ndivine, yet the Persons can love, while God can not. How then can all\nfour be omnipotent?\n\nSome will judge this theory to inherit all the problems of the\ntraditional divine simplicity doctrine it assumes. Others will\nconsider its fit with simplicity to be a feature and not a bug. Koons\npoints out that it also assumes constituent ontology, a Thomistic\naccount of thought, and the claim that the divine nature is an\nintentional relation (356).\n",
