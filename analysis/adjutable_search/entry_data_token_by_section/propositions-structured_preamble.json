    "main_text": "\n\nIt is a truism that two speakers can say the same thing by uttering\ndifferent sentences, whether in the same or different languages. For\nexample, when a German speaker utters the sentence \u2018Schnee ist\nweiss\u2019 and an English speaker utters the sentence \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019, they have said the same thing by uttering the sentences\nthey did. Proponents of propositions hold that, speaking strictly,\nwhen speakers say the same thing by means of different declarative\nsentences, there is some (non-linguistic) thing, a proposition, that\neach has\n said.[1]\n This proposition is said to be expressed by both of the sentences\nuttered (taken in the contexts of utterance\u2014to accommodate\ncontextually sensitive expressions) by the speakers, and can be\nthought of as the information content of the sentences (taken in those\ncontexts). The proposition is taken to be the thing that is in the\nfirst instance true or false. A declarative sentence is true or false\nderivatively, in virtue of expressing (in the context in which it is\nuttered\u2014this contextual sensitivity shall henceforth be ignored\nand so qualifications of this sort dispensed with) a true or false\nproposition.\n\nPropositions are thought to perform a number of other functions in\naddition to being the bearers of truth and falsity and the things\nexpressed by declarative sentences. When a German and English speaker\nbelieve the same thing, say that the earth is round, the thing they\nboth believe is not a sentence but a proposition. For the English\nspeaker would express her belief by means of the sentence \u2018The\nearth is round\u2019 and the German speaker would express her belief\nby means of the different sentence \u2018Die Erde ist rund\u2019.\nThus when people believe, doubt and know things, it is propositions\nthat they bear these cognitive relations to. Finally, it is the\nproposition a sentence expresses, and not the sentence itself, that\npossesses modal properties such as being necessary, possible or\ncontingent.\n\nThat propositions perform these various functions is agreed upon by\nvirtually all advocates of\n propositions.[2]\n There is considerably less agreement concerning the nature of the\nthings, propositions, that perform these\n functions.[3]\n\nTo say that propositions are structured is to say something about the\nnature of propositions. Roughly, to say that propositions are\nstructured is to say that they are complex entities, entities having\nparts or constituents, where the constituents are bound together in a\ncertain way. Thus, particular accounts of structured propositions can\n(and do) differ in at least two ways: 1) they can differ as to what\nsorts of things are the constituents of structured propositions; and\n2) they can differ as to what binds these constituents together in a\nproposition. Various accounts of structured propositions that differ\nin these ways will be discussed below.\n\nPut this way, the view that propositions are structured is purely a\nmetaphysical thesis about what propositions are like and entails\nnothing about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it\nexpresses. But of course structured proposition theorists do have\nviews about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it\nexpresses.\n",
