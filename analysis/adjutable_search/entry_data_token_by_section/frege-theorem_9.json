We may use the following\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression to represent this concept: \n\n\\([\\lambda x \\, \\exists F (x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg Fx)]\\) \n\nWe know that there exists such a concept, since the open formula in\nthe scope of \\(\\lambda x\\) can be used in the Comprehension Principle\nfor Concepts. Now by the Existence of Extensions principle, the\nfollowing concept exists and is correlated with it: \n\n\\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, \\exists F(x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg\nFx)]\\) \n\nIt can now be proved that this extension falls under the concept\n\\([\\lambda x \\, \\exists F(x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg Fx)]\\) if and\nonly if it does not. \n\n (First Derivation of the Contradiction.)\n \n",
