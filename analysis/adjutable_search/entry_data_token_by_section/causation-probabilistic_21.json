Pearl writes \\(\\PP(Y = y\n\\mid \\do(X = x))\\) to characterize this probability. What is the\ndifference between observation and intervention? When we merely\nobserve the value that a variable takes, we are learning about the\nvalue of the variable when it is caused in the normal way, as\nrepresented in our causal model. Information about the value of the\nvariable will also provide us with information about its causes, and\nabout other effects of those causes. However, when we intervene, we\noverride the normal causal structure, forcing a variable to take a\nvalue it might not have taken if the system were left alone. The value\nof the variable is determined completely by our intervention, the\ncausal influence of the other variables being completely overridden.\nGraphically, we can represent the effect of this intervention by\neliminating the arrows directed into the variables intervened upon.\nSuch an intervention is sometimes described as \u2018breaking\u2019\nthose arrows. \n\nA causal model can be used to predict the effects of such an\nintervention. Suppose we have a causal model in which the probability\ndistribution P satisfies MC on the causal DAG \\(\\bG\\) over the\nvariable set \\(\\bV = \\{X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\}\\). The most useful\nversion of MC for thinking about interventions is\nMCFactorization (see\n Section 3.3),\n which tells us: \n\n\\[\\PP(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\prod_i \\PP(X_i \\mid \\PA(X_i))\\]\n\n\nNow suppose that we intervene by setting the value of \\(X_k\\) to\n\\(x_k\\). The post-intervention probability \\(\\PP'\\) is the result of\naltering the factorization as follows: \n\n\\[\\PP'(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\PP'(X_k) \\times \\prod_{i\\ne k} \\PP(X_i \\mid \\PA(X_i)),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\PP'(X_k = x_k) = 1\\). The conditional probabilities of the\nform \\(\\PP(X_i \\mid \\PA(X_i))\\) for \\(i \\ne k\\) remain unchanged\nby the intervention.\n\nThis treatment of interventions has been expanded in a number of\ndirections. The \u2018manipulation theorem\u2019 (theorem 3.6 of SGS\n2000) generalizes the formula to cover a much broader class of\ninterventions, including ones that don\u2019t break all the arrows\ninto the variables that are intervened on. Pearl (2009: Chapter 3)\ndevelops an axiomatic system he calls the \u2018do-calculus\u2019\nfor computing post-intervention probabilities that can be applied to\nsystems with latent variables. \n",
