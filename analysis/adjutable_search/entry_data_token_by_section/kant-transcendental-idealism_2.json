    "main_text": "Appearances and Things in Themselves || The Empirical Thing in Itself\n1.2 The Empirical Thing in Itself\n\nJust as Kant distinguishes a transcendental from an empirical sense of\n\u201couter\u201d he also distinguishes a transcendental version of\nthe appearance/thing in itself distinction (the distinction we have\nbeen concerned with up to now) from an empirical version of that\ndistinction. The key text here is A45\u201346/B62\u201363, which for\nreasons of brevity will not be quoted in full (cf. the discussion of\nthe rose at A29\u201330/B45, as well as A257/B313).\n\nIn the empirical case, the distinction seems to be between the\nphysical properties of an object and the sensory qualities it presents\nto differently situated human observers. This requires distinguishing\nbetween what is \u201cvalid for every human sense in general\u201d\nand what \u201cpertains to [objects] only contingently because [of]\n\u2026 a particular situation or organization of this or that\nsense\u201d (A45/B62). The distinction seems to be that some\nproperties of objects are represented in experience just in virtue of\nthe a priori forms of experience, and thus have\ninter-subjective validity for all cognitive subjects, while some\nproperties depend upon the particular constitution of our sense organs\n(cf. A226/B273). The \u201cempirical thing in itself\u201d is the\nempirical object qua bearer of the former set of properties,\nwhile the \u201cempirical appearance\u201d is the empirical object\nqua bearer of all of its properties, including the latter.\nFor instance, the empirical \u201crainbow in itself\u201d is a\ncollection of water droplets with particular sizes and shapes and\nspatial relations, while the empirical \u201crainbow\nappearance\u201d is the colorful band we see in the\n sky.[5]\n\nFor our purposes, the importance of this distinction is two-fold.\nFirstly, the (transcendental) distinction is not the ordinary\ndistinction between how objects appear to us in sense perception and\nthe properties they actually have. Kantian appearances are not the\nobjects of ordinary sense perception, for Kant holds that appearances\nin themselves (things in themselves, in the empirical sense)\nlack sensory qualities like color, taste, texture, etc. In scientific\nresearch, we may discover how appearances are in themselves\n(in the empirical sense) but in so doing all we discover is more\nappearance (in the transcendental sense); scientific investigation\ninto the ultimate constituents or causal determinants of objects only\nreveals more appearance, not things in themselves. Secondly, there is\nan appearance/reality distinction at the level of\nappearances. This provides a further sense in which Kant is an\n\u201cempirical realist\u201d: appearances in themselves have\nproperties quite different than they seem to have in sense\nperception.\n\nKant\u2019s empirical realism\u2014not in his technical sense, but\nin the broader sense that he accepts an appearance/reality distinction\nat the level of appearances (see Abela 2002)\u2014is further deepened\nby his scientific realism: he accepts the existence of unobservable\nentities posited by our best scientific theories and holds that these\nentities are appearances (because they are in\n space).[6]\n Earlier, we saw texts whose prima facie meaning is that\nappearances exist, at least partly, in virtue of the contents of our\nrepresentations of them. But it is clear that Kant cannot hold that\nthe existence of an object in space is grounded in our direct\nperception of that object, for that would be incompatible with the\nexistence of unperceived spatial objects.\n",
