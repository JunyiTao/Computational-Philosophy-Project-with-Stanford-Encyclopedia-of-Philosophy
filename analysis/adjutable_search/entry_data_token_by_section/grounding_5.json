On\none view, the notion of grounding is old, perhaps as old as philosophy\nitself, with many of its most important thinkers engaging with\nquestions related to grounding. On another view, the notion of\ngrounding is decidedly new\u2014it\u2019s a recent development in\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics.\n\nCan we reconcile the grounding-is-old and grounding-is-new views? The\ndistinction between questions of grounding and questions\nabout grounding is helpful here (Raven 2019). To take but one\nwell-worn example, when Socrates asks in the Euthyphro if\nsomeone is pious because they are loved by the gods, or if they are\nloved by the gods because they are pious, perhaps Plato is directing\nour attention to a question of grounding. When in the contemporary\nliterature, philosophers are debating about whether grounding is, say,\na strict order (see\n \u00a72.3),\n this is the result of their asking questions about grounding.\nHistorically, so the thinking goes, philosophers have been interested\nin questions of grounding, whereas the contemporary literature has\nbeen primarily focused on questions about grounding. There is a sense,\nthen, in which the notion of grounding is as old as the hills, with\nthe more recent focus in the literature being directed at the notion\nitself.\n\nAlthough this characterization is appealing, it has its limitations.\nClearly, contemporary philosophers are interested in questions of\ngrounding in addition to questions about grounding. What might be less\nclear, however, is that, on the face it, the historical literature is\nby no means short of attempts at engaging with questions about\ngrounding in addition to questions of grounding. Consider, for\nexample, cosmological arguments. In broad strokes, the thought is that\nthe totality of contingent entities, the cosmos, stands in need of\nexplanation, and only considerations involving God understood as a\nnecessary existent are up to the task. Central to such arguments is an\nassumption according to which we can\u2019t explain why there are\ncontingent entities by appealing to the existence of a contingent\nentity. Debate has raged for centuries over how exactly we ought to\nunderstand this assumption and whether or not we ought to believe it.\nImportantly, this assumption is generally understood as a kind of no\ncircularity assumption. In debating whether the assumption is correct,\nhistorical figures are, albeit indirectly, debating whether or not the\nrelation at issue can have reflexive instances. The same goes for\ndiscussions around God\u2019s nature as a self-causer. If the\nrelation at issue is that of grounding, then the history of philosophy\nis rich in discussions about grounding.\n\nUltimately, however, it seems that the \u201cIs grounding old or\nnew?\u201d question should give way to nuanced and text-based\ndiscussions of structural similarities and causal continuities between\nspecific thinkers. As this entry will make clear, contemporary figures\ndon\u2019t fully agree on the concept of grounding. Hence, it seems\nthat there is little to be gained by asking whether thus-and-so\nhistorical figures used the same notion as the contemporary figures,\nas the contemporary figures aren\u2019t using the same notion\nthemselves! Beyond tracing out similarities and differences in content\nof various notions employed by historical figures and paths of\nhistorical development, the question of whether grounding is old or\nnew will apparently always be a crude generalization over these\nsimilarities and continuities. And note that there is nothing special\nabout grounding in this regard\u2014the same could be said for\nvirtually any philosophically interesting concept, such as causation\nor necessity.
