    "main_text": "What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers? || Correspondence\n3.3 Correspondence\n\n\u201cCatching cheats\u201d doesn\u2019t supply a motivation for\nadopting truth-makers. Are there other motivations for so doing? One\nsuch motivation is that truth-making falls out naturally from the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. \n\n\nAnybody who is attracted to the correspondence theory of truth should\nbe drawn to the truth-maker [sic]. Correspondence demands a\ncorrespondent, and a correspondent for a truth is a truth-maker.\n(Armstrong 1997: 14; see also 1997: 128\u20139, 2004: 16\u20137)\n\n\n\nAccording to Armstrong, the \u201ctruth-maker principle\u201d (aka\nmaximalism) just is what we are left with once we drop the assumption\nfrom the correspondence theory that the relation between truth bearers\nand truth-makers is one-one. Of course, the truth-making relation,\nhowever it is explicated, cannot be the relation of correspondence in\nterms of which truth is defined\u2014for whereas the latter\nis symmetric, the former isn\u2019t (Beebee & Dodd 2005b:\n13\u20134). But this doesn\u2019t prevent truth being defined using\nthe truth-making relation, albeit in a more roundabout way\naccording to the following pattern,\n\n(C)\n S is true \u21d4 (\u2203x)(S\nis-made-true-by x).\n\n\nOf course such a definition will only succeed if the relation\nexpressed by \u201cis-made-true-by\u201d can itself be explicated\nwithout relying upon the notion of truth itself or other\nnotions that implicitly presuppose it, e.g., entailment (Merricks\n2007: 15). This is no doubt one of the reasons that principles of\ntruth-making are typically not put forward as definitions of truth\n(David 2009: 144). Another objection made by Horwich is that it is\nimplausible to suppose that an ordinary person understands the notion\nof truth via the heterogeneous principles that govern the\nprovision of truth-makers for different types of propositions.\nIt\u2019s more plausible to suppose that we first grasp what truth\nis, and only subsequently figure out what truth-makers are required\nfor the various kinds of propositions there are (Horwich 2009:\n188).\n",
