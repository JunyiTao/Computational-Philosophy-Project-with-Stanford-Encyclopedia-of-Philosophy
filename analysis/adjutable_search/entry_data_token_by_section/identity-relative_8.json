    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || The Theological Paradox\n2.7 The Theological Paradox\n\nThe Christian doctrine of Trinity is sometimes construed as a paradox\nthat involves incongruent identity statements. For example, the\nAthanasian Creed puts it like this: \u201c[\u2026] we worship one\nGod in Trinity. [\u2026] the Father is God; the Son is God; and the\nHoly Spirit is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one\nGod\u201d. One may conceptually unbundle these statements into the\nthe following set of claims:\n\nThe Father is a God.\nThe Son is a God.\nThe Holy Spirit is a God.\nThe Father is not identical with the Son.\nThe Father is not identical with the Holy Spirit.\nThe Son is not identical with the Holy Spirit.\nThere is at most one God, i.e., if \\(x\\) is a God and \\(y\\) is a\nGod, then \\(x\\) is identical with \\(y\\).\n\n\nIt is easy to see that this set is logically inconsistent and\nconsequently one may claim that the doctrine itself is conceptually\nincongruent.\n",
