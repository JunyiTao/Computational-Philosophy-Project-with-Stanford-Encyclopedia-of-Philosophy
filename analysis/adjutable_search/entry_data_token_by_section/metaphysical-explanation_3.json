Monism vs pluralism about metaphysical explanation\n\nIn\n \u00a72,\n we canvassed some putatively different forms of metaphysical\nexplanation. But how many are there in fact? Monists about\nmetaphysical explanation think that there is just one, whereas\npluralists think that there are many. There are various different\nrespects in which one might be a monist or a pluralist. For example,\none might think that metaphysical explanations derive their\nexplanatory power from any of a number of non-causal dependence\nrelations (e.g., Thompson 2019), but that all metaphysical\nexplanations derive their explanatory power in the same way. This\nwould be a pluralism in one sense, because various kinds of relations\nproduce metaphysical explanations, but a monism in another because all\nmetaphysical explanations have the same form. A more monistic spin on\nsuch an account would hold that grounding relations produce\nmetaphysical explanations, but that there are various grounding\nmechanisms (e.g., Trogdon 2018). If the source of some metaphysical\nexplanations is relational but the source of others is to be found in\nthe essences of things, this is another version of this type of\n\u201clightweight\u201d pluralism.\n\nAccording to a more thoroughgoing pluralism, there are a number of\nfundamentally different kinds of metaphysical explanation. Such a view\ncan be motivated in a number of ways that do not at first glance\npresuppose particular views about whether relations of non-causal\ndependence like grounding, essence, and reduction reduce to one\nanother. Litland (2013) and Richardson (2020), for instance,\ndistinguish between how-explanation, which tells us\nhow or the specific way in which something is the\ncase and why-explanation, which tells us why it is\nthe case at all. Bertrand (2019) further recognizes a class of\nmetaphysical explanations by constraint:\n\u201ctop-down\u201d metaphysical explanations which show how\nparticular instances fit into a general scheme. These different kinds\nof explanation are plausibly elicited by the asking of different\nquestions.\n\nIn reply, the monist might deny that the asking of different kinds of\nquestions to elicit metaphysical explanations implies that we should\nbe pluralists. They might simply be different ways of asking for the\nsame kind of explanation, for example. Moreover, why-questions are\ngenerally taken to elicit causal explanations but can sometimes also\nbe used to elicit metaphysical explanations. One might then insist\nthat whilst differentiating kinds of explanation requests by the\nquestion asked can be a useful heuristic, it is not a perfectly\nreliable method for distinguishing different kinds of explanation.\n",
