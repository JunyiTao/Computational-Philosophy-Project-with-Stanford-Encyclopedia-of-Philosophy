    "main_text": "Objections to Cosmopolitanism || Political cosmopolitanism\n3.1 Political cosmopolitanism\n\n\nIt is often argued that it is impossible to change the current system\nof states and to form a world\u2013state or a global federation of\nstates. This claim is hard to maintain, however, in the face of the\nexistence of the United Nations, the existence of states with more\nthan a billion people of heterogeneous backgrounds, and the experience\nwith the United States and the European Union. So in order to be taken\nseriously, the objection must instead be that it is impossible to form\na good state or federation of that magnitude, i.e., that it\nis impossible to realize or even approximate the cosmopolitan ideal in\na way that makes it worth pursuing and that does not carry prohibitive\nrisks. Here political cosmopolitans disagree among themselves. On one\nend of the spectrum we find those who argue in favor of a strong\nworld-state, on the other end we find the defenders of a loose and\nvoluntary federation, or a different system altogether.\n\n\nThe defenders of the loose, voluntary and noncoercive federation warn\nthat a world-state easily becomes despotic without there being any\ncompeting power left to break the hold of despotism (Rawls).\nDefenders of the world-state reply that a stronger form of federation,\nor even merger, is the only way to truly exit the state of nature\nbetween states, or the only way to bring about international\ndistributive justice (Nielsen, Cabrera). Other authors have argued that the focus among\nmany political cosmopolitans on only these two alternatives overlooks\na third cosmopolitan position, and that a concern for human rights should lead one to focus\ninstead on institutional reform that disperses sovereignty vertically,\nrather than concentrating it in all-encompassing international\ninstitutions. On this view, peace, democracy, prosperity, and the\nenvironment would be better served by a system in which the political\nallegiance and loyalties of persons are widely dispersed over a number\nof political units of various sizes, without any one unit being\ndominant and thus occupying the traditional role of the state\n(Pogge).\n\n\nOf the objections brought up by non- or anti-cosmopolitans, two\ndeserve special mention. First, some authors argue that the (partial or\nwhole) surrender of state sovereignty required by the cosmopolitan\nscheme is an undue violation of the principle of the autonomy of states\nor the principle of democratic self-determination of their citizens.\nSecond, so-called \u2018realists\u2019 argue that states are in a\nHobbesian state of nature as far as the relations among them are\nconcerned, and that it is as inappropriate as it is futile to subject\nstates to normative constraints. To these objections cosmopolitans have\nvarious kinds of response, ranging from developing their alternative\nnormative theory (e.g., by arguing that global democracy increases\nrather than diminishes the democratic control of individual world\ncitizens) to pointing out, as has been done at least since Grotius,\nthat states have good reasons even on Hobbesian grounds to submit to\ncertain forms of international legal arrangements.\n",
