    "main_text": "\n\nThe great majority of Greek (and Roman) philosophical writings have\nbeen irretrievably lost. But this loss is made good to some extent not\nonly by quotations from lost works recorded by later writers, but also\nby the varieties of ancient reportage that are extant. The modern name\nfor these forms of reportage is \u2018doxography\u2019, which could\nbe translated \u2018tenet-writing\u2019. Broadly speaking,\ndoxography encompasses those writings, or parts of writings, in which\nthe author presents philosophical views of some or other of the\nancient philosophers or schools, in some or other areas, or on some or\nother topics, of philosophy, whether with or without presentation of\nthe argumentation or analysis through which they offered philosophical\nsupport or reasons in favor of their \u2018tenets\u2019, and whether\nor not they also include critical evaluations and comments of the\nauthor's own. In other words, these are works (or sections of works)\ntaking as their subject matter the tenets or doctrines of the\nphilosophers, rather than independent works of philosophy in which the\nauthor addresses in the first instance issues or topics of philosophy,\nwith ancillary discussion along the way of the opinions of other\nphilosophers. The terms for tenets, or views, in ancient Greek are\ndoxai or dogmata, in Latin opiniones; those\nfor doctrines are, in Greek, areskonta, translated into Latin\nas placita. But note that these designations were used\ninterchangeably.\n",
