    "main_text": "The structure of concepts || The classical theory\n2.1 The classical theory\n\nIn one way or another, all theories regarding the structure of\nconcepts are developments of, or reactions to, the classical\ntheory of concepts. According to the classical theory, a lexical\nconcept C has definitional structure in that it is composed\nof simpler concepts that express necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor falling under C. The stock example is the concept\nBACHELOR, which is traditionally said to have the constituents\nUNMARRIED and MAN. If the example is taken at face value, the idea is\nthat something falls under BACHELOR if it is an unmarried man and only\nif it is an unmarried man. According to the classical theory, lexical\nconcepts generally will exhibit this same sort of definitional\nstructure. This includes such philosophically interesting concepts as\nTRUTH, GOODNESS, FREEDOM, and JUSTICE.\n\nBefore turning to other theories of conceptual structure, it\u2019s\nworth pausing to see what\u2019s so appealing about classical or\ndefinitional structure. Much of its appeal comes from the way it\noffers unified treatments of concept acquisition, categorization, and\nreference determination. In each case, the crucial work is being done\nby the very same components. Concept acquisition can be understood as\na process in which new complex concepts are created by assembling\ntheir definitional constituents. Categorization can be understood as a\npsychological process in which a complex concept is matched to a\ntarget item by checking to see if each and every one of its\ndefinitional constituents applies to the target. And reference\ndetermination, we\u2019ve already seen, is a matter of whether the\ndefinitional constituents do apply to the target.\n\nThese considerations alone would be enough to show why the classical\ntheory has been held in such high regard. But the classical theory\nreceives further motivation through its connection with a\nphilosophical method that goes back to antiquity and that continues to\nexert its influence over contemporary thought. This is the method of\nconceptual analysis. Paradigmatic conceptual analyses offer\ndefinitions of concepts that are to be tested against potential\ncounterexamples that are identified via thought experiments.\nConceptual analysis is supposed to be a distinctively a priori\nactivity that many take to be the essence of philosophy. To the extent\nthat paradigmatic conceptual analyses are available and successful,\nthis will convey support for the classical theory. Conversely, if the\ndefinitions aren\u2019t there to be discovered, this would seem to\nput in jeopardy a venerable view of what philosophy is and how\nphilosophical investigations ought to proceed (see\n section 5\n below).\n\nThe classical theory has come under considerable pressure in the last\nforty years or so, not just in philosophy but in psychology and other\nfields as well. For psychologists, the main problem has been that the\nclassical theory has difficulty explaining a robust set of empirical\nfindings. At the center of this work is the discovery that certain\ncategories are taken to be more representative or typical and that\ntypicality scores correlate with a wide variety of psychological data\n(for reviews, see Smith & Medin 1981, Murphy 2002). For instance,\napples are judged to be more typical than plums with respect to the\ncategory of fruit, and correspondingly apples are judged to have more\nfeatures in common with fruit. There are many other findings of this\nkind. One other is that more typical items are categorized more\nefficiently. For example, subjects are quicker to judge that apples\nare a kind of fruit than to judge that plums are. The problem\nisn\u2019t that the classical theory is inconsistent with results\nlike these but that it does nothing to explain them.\n\nIn philosophy, the classical theory has been subjected to a number of\ncriticisms but perhaps the most fundamental is that attempts to\nspecify definitions for concepts have a poor track record. Quite\nsimply, there are too few examples of successful definitional\nanalyses, and certainly none that are uncontroversial (Wittgenstein\n1953/1958, Fodor 1981). The huge literature on the analysis of\nknowledge is representative of the state of things. Since Edmund\nGettier (1963) first challenged the traditional definition of\nKNOWLEDGE (as JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF), there has been widespread\nagreement among philosophers that the traditional definition is\nincorrect or at least incomplete (see the entry\n the analysis of knowledge)).\n But no one can seem to agree on what the correct definition is.\nDespite the enormous amount of effort that has gone into the matter,\nand the dozens of papers written on the issue, we are still lacking a\nsatisfactory and complete definition. It could be that the problem is\nthat definitions are hard to come by. But another\npossibility\u2014one that many philosophers are now taking\nseriously\u2014is that our concepts lack definitional structure.\n",
