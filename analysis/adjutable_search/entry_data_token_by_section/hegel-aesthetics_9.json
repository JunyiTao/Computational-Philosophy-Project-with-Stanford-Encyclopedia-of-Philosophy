    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Systematic Aesthetics or Philosophy of Art || The System of the Individual Arts\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nHegel\u2019s aesthetics has been the focus of\u2014often highly\ncritical\u2014attention since his death from philosophers such as\nHeidegger, Adorno and Gadamer. Much of this attention has been devoted\nto his supposed theory of the \u201cend\u201d of art. Perhaps\nHegel\u2019s most important legacy, however, lies in the claims that\nart\u2019s task is the presentation of beauty and that beauty is a\nmatter of content as well as form. Beauty, for Hegel, is not just a\nmatter of formal harmony or elegance; it is the sensuous manifestation\nin stone, color, sound or words of spiritual freedom and life.\nSuch beauty takes a subtly different form in the classical and romantic\nperiods and also in the different individual arts. In one form or\nanother, however, it remains the purpose of art, even in\nmodernity.\n\n\nThese claims by Hegel are normative, not just descriptive, and impose\ncertain restrictions on what can count as genuine art in the modern\nage. They are not, however, claims made out of simple conservatism.\nHegel is well aware that art can be decorative, can promote moral and\npolitical goals, can explore the depths of human alienation or simply\nrecord the prosaic details of everyday life, and that it can do so with\nconsiderable artistry. His concern, however, is that art that does\nthese things without giving us beauty fails to afford us the\naesthetic experience of freedom. In so doing, it deprives us\nof a central dimension of a truly human life.\n",
