    "main_text": "Newton\u2019s relation to Cartesianism\n3. Newton\u2019s relation to Cartesianism\n\nLike many philosophers who worked in the wake of Galileo and of\nDescartes, it seems that Newton never extensively analyzed\nAristotelian ideas about nature. He would have encountered such ideas\nin the curriculum at Trinity College, but there is not much evidence\nthat he took them seriously. Instead, he focused on the\n\u201cmodern\u201d thinkers that enterprising young students were\ntold to read outside of the standard\n curriculum.[10]\n And in England in Newton\u2019s day, the greatest modern philosopher\nof nature was thought to be Descartes (Heilbron 1982: 30). There is\nsubstantial evidence that Newton took Descartes\u2019s ideas very\nseriously, and expended considerable energy thinking them through and\neventually coming to criticize them. Some of that evidence comes from\na manuscript that was first transcribed and published in 1962 by the\ngreat historians of science, Marie Boas Hall and A. Rupert Hall. The\nuntitled manuscript, now known as \u201cDe\nGravitatione\u201d after its first line, has been the subject of\nextensive discussions over the past fifty years because it indicates\nthe depth of Newton\u2019s interest in Cartesian ideas in metaphysics\nand natural philosophy. Despite its importance to contemporary\nunderstandings of Newton\u2019s relation to Cartesianism, and much\nelse besides, De Gravitatione is not without its problems.\nFirst and foremost, the manuscript lacks a date, and there is no\nscholarly consensus regarding its precise\n provenance.[11]\n Second, the manuscript was never finished, so it is difficult to\nassess its relationship with Newton\u2019s mature thinking in\nphilosophy. Finally, the manuscript was not published during\nNewton\u2019s lifetime, so there are questions about whether it\nrepresents his considered views. Despite these facts, the text\ncontains a treasure trove of arguments concerning Cartesian ideas. For\ninstance, it dispels the easily formed impression that Newton sought,\nin the Principia, to undermine a Leibnizian conception of\nspace and time, as his defender, Samuel Clarke, would attempt to do\nyears later in the correspondence of 1715\u201316 (discussed below).\nAlthough Leibniz did eventually express what became the canonical\nearly modern formulation of \u201crelationalism\u201d concerning\nspace and time\u2014the view, roughly, that space is nothing but the\norder of relations among physical objects, and time nothing over and\nabove the succession of events involving those objects\u2014and\nalthough Newton and Clarke were highly skeptical of such a view, it is\nmisleading to read the Principia through the lens provided by\nthe later controversy with the Leibnizians. Newton\u2019s extensive\nattempt in De Gravitatione to refute Descartes\u2019s\nconception of space and time in particular indicates that the Scholium\nshould be read as providing a replacement for the Cartesian\n conception.[12]\n That is, Newton had a Cartesian, and not a Leibnizian, opponent\nprimarily in mind when he wrote his famous articulation of\n\u201cabsolutism\u201d concerning space and time. Unlike questions\nabout Newton\u2019s methods and his apparent deviation from the norms\nestablished by mechanist philosophers like Descartes and Boyle,\nNewton\u2019s conception of space and time, along with his view of\nthe divine being, did not immediately engender a philosophical debate.\nIt was Leibniz more than any other philosopher who eventually\nsucceeded in fomenting a philosophical debate in which the\n\u201cNewtonian\u201d conception of space, time and the divine would\nplay a central role (see below). But Leibniz\u2019s philosophical\nviews were relatively unknown when Newton first formed his\nconception--to the young Newton writing the Principia,\nLeibniz was another mathematician and not yet a contributor to natural\nphilosophy. Instead, it was Descartes\u2019s view of space, the\nworld, and God, which he pondered in his youth and eventually came to\nreject.\n\nNewton took special interest in the Cartesian view of space and body,\nand in related views concerning the causal relations between minds and\nbodies and between God and the bodies that constitute the natural\nworld. Like many of Newton\u2019s contemporaries in Cambridge in\nthose days, he encountered these Cartesian views within the context of\nHenry More\u2019s then famous discussions of Cartesianism (a term\ncoined by More himself). Beginning with his correspondence with\nDescartes in 1648 (Lewis 1953), and continuing with a series of\npublications in later years, many of which Newton owned in his\npersonal library (Harrison 1978), More argued that Descartes made two\nfundamental mistakes: first, he wrongly contended that extension and\nmatter are identical (and that the world is therefore a plenum); and\nsecond, he mistakenly believed that God and the mind were not extended\nsubstances, which made their causal interactions with such substances\nmysterious. Just as Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia had raised\nfundamental objections to Cartesian dualism (see Shapiro 2007) in the\nearly 1640s, More raised similar objections against the Cartesian view\nof the divine a few years later (Lewis 1953). Descartes agreed with\nMore\u2019s suggestion that God can act anywhere on nature if he so\nchooses, and came very close to accepting More\u2019s contention that\nsuch a view entails that God must be present within the world wherever\nhe in fact chooses to act. For how could God part the Red Sea,\nsuggested More, unless God were present precisely where the Red Sea is\nlocated? Of course, More agreed that God is not made of parts, cannot\nbe imagined, and cannot be affected by the causal activity of material\nbodies\u2014the causal arrow flows only in one direction. But More\nconcluded that God is extended in his own way. If one fixes\nDescartes\u2019s two basic mistakes, one obtains what More regarded\nas a proper philosophical view: space is distinct from matter because\nit is extended but penetrable, whereas matter is extended but\nimpenetrable; and, in tandem, all substances are extended, but whereas\nsome, such as tables and chairs, are impenetrable, others, such as the\nmind and God, are penetrable and therefore not\n material.[13]\n Newton was deeply influenced both by More\u2019s criticisms of\nDescartes and by his positive philosophical conception of space and\nthe divine.\n\nIn a number of texts, including De Gravitatione, the famous\ndiscussion of space and time in the Scholium to the\nPrincipia, and the discussion of God in the General Scholium,\nNewton made his generally Morean attitudes perfectly clear. He\nrejected the Cartesian identification of extension and matter, arguing\nthat space itself exists independently of material objects (and their\nrelations), and he contended that all entities, including the human\nmind and even the divine being, are extended in the sense that they\nhave spatial location, even if they are extended in ways that\ndistinguish them from ordinary material\n bodies.[14]\n In Newton\u2019s hands, space becomes a fundamental concept of\nnatural philosophy, an attitude that is foreign to Cartesians. As\nNewton puts it in a famous passage from De Gravitatione:\n\n\nSpace is an affection of a being just as a being. No being exists or\ncan exist which is not related to space in some way. God is every\nwhere, created minds are somewhere, and body is in the space that it\noccupies; and whatever is neither everywhere nor anywhere does not\nexist. And hence it follows that space is an emanative effect of the\nfirst existing being, for if any being whatsoever is posited, space is\nposited. (Newton 2004: 25)\n\n\nSpace is a fundamental concept in part because Newton not only\nconceives of it as independent of objects and their relations, but\nbecause he argues that every entity must somehow connect with space in\nsome way. For Newton, then, if one follows the Cartesians and thinks\nof the mind, or of God, as existing without any spatial\nlocation\u2014as existing either \u201cbeyond\u201d the natural\nworld or somehow outside of it\u2014then that is equivalent to\nconceiving of them as non-existent. Newton does not shy away from\nmaking this conception of the divine explicit in his public writings,\ndespite the fact that it was anathema to his Cartesian and Leibnizian\ncontemporaries. In the General Scholium to the Principia,\nwhich was added to the second edition of the text in 1713, for\ninstance, he famously writes of God:\n\n\nHe endures always and is present everywhere, and by existing always\nand everywhere he constitutes duration and space. Since each and every\nparticle of space is always, and each and every indivisible\nmoment of duration is everywhere, certainly the maker and\nlord of all things will not be never or nowhere\n\u2026 God is one and the same God always and everywhere. He is\nomnipresent not only virtually but also\nsubstantially; for active power cannot subsist without\nsubstance. (Newton 1999: 941)\n\n\nFor Newton, just as bodies are present in some spatial location, God,\nan infinite being, is present throughout all of space throughout all\nof time. There could not be a clearer expression of agreement with\nMore in his debate with the Cartesians concerning the substantial\npresence of the divine within space.\n\nNewton also took issue with Cartesian ideas about motion. His\nrejection of Cartesian views of space, and his embrace of space as a\nfundamental concept in philosophy following More\u2019s influence,\naligns with his famous discussion of space and time in the Scholium\nthat follows the opening definitions in the Principia. This\ntext influenced nearly every subsequent philosophical discussion of\nspace and time for the next three centuries, so its contours are well\nknown (see DiSalle 2006: ch. 2). In his Principles of\nPhilosophy of 1644, Descartes had distinguished between the\n\u201cordinary\u201d and the \u201cproper\u201d view of motion:\nwhereas the ordinary view presents motion as a body\u2019s change of\nplace, the philosopher knows that properly speaking, motion is a\nbody\u2019s change of relations to the bodies that surround it\n(recall Descartes\u2019s plenum). Newton contends in De\nGravitatione that this idea of proper motion, according to which\nthe motion of a body is at least partially a function of its relations\nto other bodies, is in tension with Descartes\u2019s own laws of\nnature, also presented in the Principles. For according to\nthe conception of (what we now call) inertia that Descartes presents\nas his first two laws, a body moving rectilinearly will continue to do\nso unless caused to deviate from its path\u2014hence a body\u2019s\nmotion is not a function of its spatial relations to other bodies, but\nrather of its causal relations. That is, according to the\nfirst two laws, changing a body\u2019s spatial relations to others\nbodies will not alter its rectilinear motion unless a causal\ninteraction occurs. This tension runs deep in the Cartesian system.\nNewton\u2019s Scholium reflects his idea that the concept of motion\nin the Principia ought to cohere with the laws of motion he\nendorses. He distinguishes between absolute and relative motion, true\nand apparent motion, and mathematical and common motion (the same\ndistinctions hold for time, space and place). The former item in each\nof these three pairings is a concept that coheres with the laws of\nmotion. Newton\u2019s first law reflects Descartes\u2019s laws: it\nis a new version of the principle of inertia, one incorporating the\nconcept of an impressed force. Since this law indicates that a\nbody\u2019s motion is not a function of its spatial relations to\nother bodies, but rather of whether forces are impressed on\nit\u2014which replaces the Cartesian concept of causal interactions\nthat involve only impact (see below)\u2014Newton cannot rely on a\nbody\u2019s motion relative to other bodies if he is to avoid the\nkind of tension he found in the Cartesian view. Hence he indicates\nthat a body\u2019s true motion\u2014rather than its apparent motion,\nwhich depends on our perceptions, or its relative motion, which\ndepends on its spatial relations\u2014is a body\u2019s change of\nposition within space itself. That is, true motion should be\nunderstood as absolute motion. This means, in turn, that we must\ndistinguish between the common idea of space, according to which space\nis conceived of as involving relations among various objects (like the\nspace of our air), and the mathematical idea, one presumably obtained\nfrom geometrical reasoning, that space is independent of any objects\nor their relations. In order to account for the idea that true motion\nis absolute motion, then, the famous \u201cabsolute space\u201d is\npostulated.\n\nNewton was perfectly well aware that the notion of absolute space is\nnot\n unproblematic.[15]\n For instance, if a body\u2019s true motion just is its\nabsolute motion, its motion with respect to space itself, then the\nimperceptibility of space would appear to render any detection of true\nmotion difficult, if not hopeless. Indeed, how would we detect any\nbody\u2019s true motion on this view? We might be able to detect a\nbody\u2019s changing spatial relations with its neighbors, but not\nits changing relationship with space itself! Newton\u2019s solution\nto this problem is ingenious. Under certain circumstances, we can\ndetect a body\u2019s true motion by detecting its acceleration. We\ncan do so when the body is rotating or has a circular motion, for such\nmotions often have detectable effects. This is one way of\nunderstanding what has become one of the most famous, if not infamous,\nexperiments of the early modern period, Newton\u2019s bucket.\n(He grew up in part on a farm in the English countryside, and often\nused deceptively simple examples.) If one takes an ordinary bucket and\nfills it with water, and then attaches a rope to the top of the\nbucket, one can then twist the rope and let it go in order to make the\nbucket spin. When the bucket full of water spins around, we can detect\nthe water\u2019s acceleration by its changing surface. As Newton puts\nit, using his laws of motion, the water endeavors to recede from the\naxis of its motion (hence its changing surface). But even an observer\nuntutored in physics would grasp the importance of the water\u2019s\nchanging surface--that is, perceiving the effect does not depend on\nunderstanding the laws. In this way, despite the fact that Newton\nwishes to conceive of the water\u2019s true motion as its absolute\nmotion within space itself, which cannot be perceived, he shows his\nreaders how they might detect the water\u2019s true motion through\nits effects. Newton provides another simple experiment to illustrate a\nsimilar point. If two balls are joined together by a rope and then\nspun around, say over one\u2019s head, then the changing tension in\nthe rope will indicate that the balls are accelerated. Since any\nacceleration is a true motion\u2014although not all true motions are\naccelerations, since a so-called inertial motion is not\u2014this\ncase indicates that we can detect a body\u2019s true motion even\nthough space itself is imperceptible. In this way, Newton did not\nmerely develop an alternative to the Cartesian view of motion, along\nwith its allied conception of space; he presented a view that could be\nemployed to pick out some of the true motions of objects within\nnature. Once one has found a true motion, one can then ask what\ncaused that motion (for Newton, as we will see, it is forces\nthat are understood to cause motions). As the last line of the\nScholium in the Principia indicates, that is one reason that\nNewton wrote his magnum opus in the first place.\n\nNewton\u2019s idea of space, then, fulfilled at least two roles.\nFirst, it enabled him to avoid the tension between the concept of true\nmotion and the laws of motion of the kind found in Descartes. Second,\nit also enabled him to articulate what he took to be God\u2019s\nrelation to the natural world. Many regarded his achievements as an\nimportant advance over the Cartesian system. However, it would be a\nmistake to think that Newton vanquished Cartesian ideas within his\nlifetime: even in England, and certainly on the Continent,\nCartesianism remained a powerful philosophical force for several\ndecades after Newton published his primary\n works.[16]\n Typically, however, Descartes\u2019s followers emphasized the\nimportance of his ideas about the mechanisms that pervade nature\nrather than his views of space and time. In that arena, Newton\u2019s\nviews were especially prominent, and came in for significant criticism\nfrom Leibniz.\n",
