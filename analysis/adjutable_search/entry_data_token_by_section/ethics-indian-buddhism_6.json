    "main_text": "War, Violence and Punishment\n7. Abortion and Euthanasia\n\nThere is considerable controversy about the moral status of abortion\nin Buddhist ethics, with the majority of writers taking a pro-life\nposition. The basic premise of the traditional understanding of\nabortion in Buddhism is that reincarnation is a discrete event which\nhappens at the time of conception. This claim can be found in\ndiscussions of reincarnation in prestigious sources such as the\nTreasury of Metaphysics (Abhidharma-ko\u015ba) of\nVasubandhu. It implies that an embryo, even during the first week of\npregnancy, is a human being. As discussed in section 5, what is\ndistinctively valuable about human life is the possibility of\nawakening. When the life of a fetus is taken through abortion, this\npossibility is foreclosed. It follows that abortion is seriously\nwrong, almost as serious as the deliberate murder of an adult. This is\nthe view of most Buddhists on the mainland of Asia today.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the technological and social\ncontext of abortion has changed dramatically since the time when the\nP\u0101li Canon was composed. Today, a woman might be informed by her\ndoctor that the fetus she is carrying suffers from a severe genetic\nabnormality; if she gives birth, her baby will live for a few days or\na few months in great pain before its inevitable early death. At the\ntime of the Buddha, medical technology was obviously far too\nundeveloped to make such a situation possible. In the P\u0101li Canon,\nmany of the cases that involve abortion relate to a woman in a\npolygamous marriage who is jealous of her co-wife\u2019s pregnancy\nand wishes to cause her rival to miscarry. Buddhist teachers who\nformulated a blanket prohibition on abortion with this latter type of\ncase in mind might reconsider if they were aware of the former type of\ncase.\n\nUnlike some other world religions, Buddhism does not have any moral\nobjection to contraception. Thus Buddhists could easily agree to\nsupport programs to reduce the need for abortion by making\ncontraception more widely available and educating people in its\nuse.\n\nSome Buddhists might question the premise that a human being exists\nfrom the time of conception onward. Some Buddhists in the contemporary\nWest do not read the traditional teachings about reincarnation\nliterally, and so would not have reason to accept that reincarnation\nhappens at the moment of conception. Moreover, there are scientific\nreasons to believe that consciousness does not begin until at least\nthe twentieth week of pregnancy (McMahan 2002, 267). There can be no\nreincarnation without consciousness. If we want both to believe in\nreincarnation and to accept what science tells us about the physical\nbases of consciousness, we should perhaps hold that reincarnation is a\ngradual process that slowly brings about a new conscious being that is\nconnected with one who has recently died. This concept of a gradual\nbeginning of life may be counterintuitive in some respects, but it\nharmonizes well with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of no self. If\nwe accept this understanding, then early abortion would not constitute\nkilling a sentient being.\n\nDespite these counterarguments, most Buddhists today would accept\nthat, in their ethical system, abortion is morally wrong. It does not\nnecessarily follow that they would advocate making abortion illegal.\nIn many ways, it is contrary to the spirit of Buddhism to impose\nBuddhist values on others by force. Buddhists were early advocates of\nreligious toleration, and the political environment of India before\nthe Islamic invasions was mostly quite a tolerant one in practice.\nMoreover, Buddhist states have usually not chosen to prohibit such\npractices as slaughtering and eating animals, even when their rulers\nhave held that these practices are immoral. Some writers have argued\nthat due to the severity of the offense of killing a human, abortion\nin particular should not be legally tolerated by Buddhist societies\n(for example, see Harvey 2000, 342\u2013350). In fact, in some\nBuddhist countries, such as Japan, abortion is legal; in others, it is\ntechnically illegal, but the law is not strictly enforced. In a\ndiverse society where the moral status of fetuses is controversial, a\nstrict prohibition on abortion is likely to be difficult and costly to\nenforce, and doing so would lead to intense social controversy,\nalienating people from their own government. The inevitable use of\ncoercion and violence in law enforcement, in the form of police and\nprisons, itself represents a grave karmic cost of imposing any penal\nlaw on segments of the population who do not accept it as legitimate.\nThus many of the reasons internal to the Buddhist tradition that could\nbe used to argue in favor of religious toleration would also seem to\nsupport a legal regime that permits abortion, even if Buddhist ethical\nviews imply that abortion is wrong.\n\nThe Buddhist tradition is less strongly opposed to suicide than some\nother world religions. For a young, healthy person to complete suicide\nis seen unequivocally as a destructive action. Yet the texts have a\nperspective of greater ambivalence and complexity toward the suicide\nof the gravely ill. Nevertheless, since the overall outlook of their\nreligion encourages Buddhists to value life and oppose killing, they\ntend to be quite concerned about the moral status of euthanasia and\nassisted suicide.\n\nTraditional Buddhist beliefs imply that to die mindfully, with full\nawareness of the processes of death, is a powerful spiritual practice.\nThe vivid, direct experience of impermanence and the strong sense of\nnon-attachment that result from dying this way could contribute\nprofoundly to the spiritual progress of that person in future lives.\nThis consideration motivates some Buddhists to allow death to take its\nnatural course, neither hastening it through suicide nor putting it\noff briefly through desperate measures of little benefit. Those who\nlack the needed depth of spiritual training may not be able to die\nmindfully, and therefore may be better candidates for aggressive\nmedical intervention to prolong life. Even for them, though, the\nchaos, excitement, confusion and fear of dying in the midst of\naggressive medical intervention may increase the risk of an\nunfavorable rebirth. If the intervention promises no more than a\nchance of a few more hours or days of life, with no hope of a genuine\nrecovery, those who believe in future lives may see it as a poor\noption.\n\nThe very strong emphasis on the relief of suffering we find in\nBuddhist ethics might lead us to conclude that Buddhists should favor\nassisted suicide or euthanasia when a patient is in severe pain, wants\nto die, but is unable to complete suicide due to physical limitations.\nA doctor who carries out such procedures, though, even with the\nconsent of the patients involved, is in a karmically perilous\nposition. If the doctor\u2019s motives for killing terminal patients\nare in any way impure, the karmic consequences could be very serious.\nThe same applies to family members who cause the death of their\nrelative while motivated, even in part, by greed or by dislike of that\nperson.\n\nFor more information on these issues, see the detailed and helpful\ndiscussion by Peter Harvey (Harvey 2000, 286\u2013310). The questions\nof euthanasia and assisted suicide involve several important Buddhist\nvalues which may be in tension with each other. In looking at these\nmatters from a Buddhist perspective, we are unlikely to find any easy\nanswers.\n\n",
