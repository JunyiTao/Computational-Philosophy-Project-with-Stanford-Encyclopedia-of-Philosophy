    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Freedom of Expression\n3.3 Freedom of Expression\n\nMill begins his defense of basic liberties with a discussion of\nfreedom of expression. He thinks that there is general agreement on\nthe importance of free speech and that, once the grounds for free\nspeech are understood, this agreement can be exploited to support a\nmore general defense of individual liberties (I 16; III 1). So his\ndefense of expressive liberties is important not only in its own right\nbut also insofar as it lays the foundation of his liberal\nprinciples.\n\nMill\u2019s discussion of censorship in Chapter II focuses on\ncensorship whose aim is to suppress false or immoral opinion (II\n1\u20132). He mentions four reasons for maintaining free speech and\nopposing censorship.\n\nA censored opinion might be true (II 1\u201320, 41).\nEven if literally false, a censored opinion might contain part of\nthe truth (II 34\u201339, 42).\nEven if wholly false, a censored opinion would prevent true\nopinions from becoming dogma (II 1\u20132, 6, 7, 22\u201323,\n43).\nAs a dogma, an unchallenged opinion will lose its meaning (II 26,\n43).\n\n\nIt is natural to group these four considerations into two main kinds:\nthe first two invoke a truth-tracking defense of expressive liberties,\nwhile the second two appeal to a distinctive kind of value that free\ndiscussion is supposed to have.\n3.3.1 The Truth-Tracking Rationale\n\nThe first two claims represent freedom of expression as instrumentally\nvaluable; it is valuable, not in itself, but as the most reliable\nmeans of producing something else that Mill assumes is valuable\n(either extrinsically or intrinsically), namely, true belief. It is\nnot hard to see how true beliefs would possess at least instrumental\nvalue, if only because our actions, plans, and reasoning are likely to\nbe more successful when based on true beliefs. Of course, the most\nreliable means of promoting true belief would be to believe\neverything. But that would bring a great deal of false belief along\ntoo. A more plausible goal to promote would be something like the\nratio of true belief to false belief. Freedom of expression might then\nbe defended as a more reliable policy for promoting the ratio of true\nbelief to false belief than a policy of censorship. This rationale for\nfreedom of expression is echoed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in\nhis famous dissent in Abrams v. United States (1919) when he\nclaims that the best test of truth is free trade in the marketplace of\nideas.\n\nNotice that this instrumental defense of freedom of expression does\nnot require the mistaken assumption that the censor must assume his\nown infallibility (OL II 3). The censor can recognize that he\nmight be mistaken, but insist that he must act on the best available\nevidence about what is true. Mill can reply that proper\nrecognition of one's own fallibility should typically lead one to keep\ndiscussion open and not foreclose discussion of possibilities that\nseem improbable.\n\nThis instrumental rationale may justify freedom of expression in\npreference to a policy of censorship whenever the censor finds the\nbeliefs in question implausible or offensive. But it does not justify\nfreedom of expression in preference to more conservative forms of\ncensorship. If the question is what policies are likely to increase\nthe ratio of true to false belief, we would seem to be justified in\ncensoring opinions for whose falsity there is especially clear,\ncompelling, and consistent or stable evidence. We would be on good\nground in censoring flat-earthers (both literal and figurative).\n\nAnother way to see the weakness of the truth-tracking justification of\nfreedom of expression is to notice that this instrumental defense of\nfreedom of expression cannot explain what is wrong with censorship\nthat is successful in truth-tracking terms. Suppose we lived in a\nsociety of the sort Plato imagines in the Republic in which\ncognitive capacities are distributed unequally between rulers and\ncitizens and in which maximally knowledgeable and reliable\ncensors\u2014call them \u201cphilosopher kings\u201d\u2014censor\nall and only false beliefs. The truth-tracking argument would provide\nno argument against censorship in such circumstances. This shows that\nthe truth-tracking argument condemns only unsuccessful or\nincompetent censorship. For some, this may be the biggest\nworry about censorship. But many would have residual worries about\nsuccessful or competent censorship. They would\nobject to censorship, even by philosopher-kings. Answering this worry\nrequires a more robust defense of expressive liberties.\n3.3.2 The Deliberative Rationale\n\nThe resources for a more robust defense of freedom of expression can\nbe found in Mill\u2019s claim that it is needed to keep true beliefs\nfrom becoming dogmatic, because this reason for valuing freedom is\nintended to rebut the case for censorship even on the assumption that\nall and only false beliefs would be censored (II 2, 21).\n\nMill\u2019s claim that the value of freedom of expression lies in\nkeeping true beliefs from becoming dogmatic reflects his view that\nfreedoms of thought and discussion are necessary for fulfilling our\nnatures as progressive beings (OL II 20). For instance, Mill\nappeals to a familiar distinction between true belief, on the\none hand, and knowledge, understood as something like\njustified true belief, on the other hand (II 22; cf. Scanlon\n1972; Ten 1980: 126\u201328). Progressive beings seek knowledge or\njustified true belief, and not simply true belief. Whereas the mere\npossession of true beliefs need not exercise one\u2019s deliberative\ncapacities, because they might be the product of indoctrination, their\njustification would. One exercises deliberative capacities in the\njustification of one\u2019s beliefs and actions that is required for\ntheoretical and practical knowledge. This is because justification\ninvolves comparison of, and deliberation among, alternatives (II 6, 7,\n8, 22\u201323, 43). Freedoms of thought and discussion are essential\nto the justification of one\u2019s beliefs and actions, because\nindividuals are not cognitively self-sufficient (II 38, 39; III 1).\nSharing thought and discussion with others, especially about important\nmatters, improves one\u2019s deliberations. It enlarges the menu of\noptions, by identifying new options worth consideration, and helps one\nbetter assess the merits of these options, by forcing on one\u2019s\nattention new considerations and arguments about the comparative\nmerits of the options. In these ways, open and vigorous discussion\nwith diverse interlocutors improves the quality of one\u2019s\ndeliberations. If so, censorship, even of false belief, can rob both\nthose whose speech is suppressed and their audience of resources that\nthey need to justify their beliefs and actions (II 1).\n\nThis deliberative rationale can explain why it is often wrong to\ncensor even false beliefs. In this way, Mill\u2019s defense of\nexpressive liberties that relies on his perfectionist appeal to\ndeliberative values is a more robust defense than the one provided by\nhis truth-tracking arguments alone.\n",
