    "main_text": "Conception of Knowledge || Internalism and Justification\n1.2 Internalism and Justification\n\nOne way to divide up theories of justification is in terms of the\ninternalism-externalism distinction. Very roughly: a theory of\nepistemic justification is internalist insofar as it requires\nthat the justifying factors are accessible to the knower\u2019s\nconscious awareness; it is externalist insofar as it does not\nimpose this requirement.\n\nDescartes holds an internalist account requiring that all justifying\nfactors take the form of ideas. (For a partly externalist \ninterpretation of Descartes, see Della Rocca 2005.) Various texts \nimply that ideas are, strictly speaking, the only objects of immediate \nperception or awareness. (More on the directness or immediacy of sense \nperception in \n Section 9.1.)\n Independent of assumptions about the directness of perception,\nDescartes\u2019 method of doubt underwrites an assumption with\nsimilar force: for almost the entirety of the Meditations,\nhis meditator-spokesperson \u2013 hereafter, the\n\u2018meditator\u2019 \u2013 adopts the methodological assumption\nthat all his thoughts and experiences are occurring in a dream. This\nassumption is tantamount to requiring that justification comes in the\nform of ideas, rather than via direct perception of an extramental\nworld.\n\nAn important consequence of this kind of interpretation \u2013\ni.e., a traditional representationalist understanding of ideas\n\u2013 is that rigorous philosophical inquiry must proceed via an\ninside-to-out strategy. This strategy is assiduously followed in the\nMeditations, and it endures as a hallmark of many early\nmodern epistemologies. Ultimately, all judgments are grounded in an\ninspection of the mind\u2019s own ideas. Philosophical inquiry\nis, properly understood, an investigation of ideas. The\nmethodical strategy of the Meditations has the effect of\nforcing readers to adopt this mode of inquiry.\n\nIn recent years, some commentators have questioned this traditional\nway of understanding the mediating role of ideas. Noteworthy is John\nCarriero\u2019s outstanding commentary on the Meditations\n(2009), an account providing a serious challenge to traditional\nrepresentationalist interpretations (including the kind of \ninterpretation often assumed in the present account).\n",
