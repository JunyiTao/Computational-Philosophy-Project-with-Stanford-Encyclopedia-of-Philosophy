    "main_text": "Characterizing Presupposition || Cancellability\n1.3 Cancellability\n\nWhat makes the \u201cprojection problem\u201d problematic? If some\npart of the meaning of an expression \u03b1 was never affected by the\nlinguistic context in which \u03b1 was embedded, that would be\nphilosophically interesting, and would demand a theoretical\nexplanation, but it would at least be trivial to completely describe\nthe data: all presuppositional inferences would survive any embedding,\nend of story. But that isn\u2019t what happens. Presuppositions typically\nproject, but often do not, and most of the empirical and theoretical\nwork on presupposition since the 1970s has been taken up with the task\nof describing and explaining when presuppositions project, and when\nthey don\u2019t.\n\nWhen a presupposition does not project, it is sometimes said to be\n\u201ccancelled\u201d. The classic cases of cancellation occur when\nthe presupposition is directly denied, as in the following variants of\nsome of the sentences in (5):\n\n(8a)\nIn this court, it isn\u2019t the knave that steals the tarts: the king\nemploys no knaves precisely because he suspects they are responsible\nfor large-scale tart-loss across his kingdom.\n(8b)\nIf it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts, then I\u2019m a Dutchman: there\nis no knave here.\n(8c)\nIs it the knave that stole the tarts? Certainly not: there is no\nknave here.\n(8d)\nThe king thinks it\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts, but he\u2019s\nobviously gone mad, since there is no knave here.\n\n\nPresuppositional inferences are typically subject to cancellation by\ndirect denial only when the presupposition trigger is embedded under\nsome other operator. When the presupposition is not embedded, such\ncancellation (by the same speaker) is usually infelicitous, just as is\ncancellation of entailed content which is not embedded. Thus the\ndenial of a presupposition in (9) and the denial of an ordinary\nentailment in (10) both lead to pragmatically infelicitous utterances\n(marked by a \u201c#\u201d).\n\n(9)\n#It\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts, but there is no knave.\n\n\n(10)\n#It\u2019s the knave that stole the tarts, but he didn\u2019t do anything\nillegal.\n\n\nThe fact that presuppositions associated with unembedded triggers are\nnot cancellable, except in an outright retraction of what the speaker\nhas previously claimed, is one of the features that distinguishes most\npresuppositions from Gricean conversational implicatures (Grice,\n1989). For example, an utterance of (11a) might ordinarily lead to the\nso-called scalar implicature in (11b). But while this implicature is\ncancellable, as in (11c), the presupposition that there is a knave,\nonce again, is not cancellable, as shown by the oddity of (11d).\n\n(11a)\nThe knave stole most of the tarts.\n(11b)\nThe knave did not steal all of the tarts.\n(11c)\nThe knave stole most of the tarts\u2014in fact, he stole them\nall.\n(11d)\n#The knave stole most of the tarts, but there was no knave.\n\n\nWe can summarize the typical behavior of entailments, presuppositions,\nand conversational implicatures as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\nEntailments\nPresuppositions\nImplicatures \n\nProject from embeddings\nno\nyes\nno \n\nCancellable when embedded\n\u2014\nyes\n\u2014 \n\nCancellable when unembedded\nno\nno\nyes \n\n\nBecause presuppositions are typically only cancellable when embedded,\nGazdar (1979a, 1979b) argues that presuppositions are usually entailed\nwhen the trigger is not embedded.\n\nThe literature is choc-a-bloc with examples of presuppositional\ninferences apparently disappearing. Whether such examples are\nappropriately described as involving cancellation is partly a\ntheoretical decision, and, as we will see, many scholars avoid using\nthe term \u201ccancellation\u201d for some or all such cases. One\nreason for this is that the term \u201ccancellation\u201d appears to\nsuggest that an inference has been made, and then removed. But in many\ncases there are theoretical reasons not to regard it as an apt\ncharacterization, and in considering early views on presupposition in\nthe next section, we will come across one class of such cases\n(specifically, cases involving hypothetical reasoning in\nconditionals).\n",
