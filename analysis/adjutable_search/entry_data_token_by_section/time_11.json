    "main_text": "Time and Physics\n12. Time and Rationality\n\nA final important question concerns how considerations about the\nnature of time ought to impact the ways that we reason about time. For\nexample, if it turns out that a B-theory is true, and there is no\nmetaphysically important difference between the past and future, then\nshould we adopt a more neutral attitude about events in our personal\npast and future? Epicurean philosopher Lucretius famously suggested\nthat if there is no substantive difference between the times in the\npast before we came to exist and the times in the future after we die,\nwe should care much less about the deprivation that death will bring.\nBut we may think that even if the B-theory can describe everything\nthat is metaphysically important without positing an important\ndifference between the past and future, there is still an\nindispensable psychological importance to the past/future distinction\nthat rational agents honor. Still other A-theorists argue that while\nthere is an important metaphysical distinction between the past and\nfuture, the distinction has no normative importance.\n\nIf we deny three-dimensionalism and instead view ourselves as objects\nthat persist through time by having temporal parts, then does that\njustify caring less about temporal parts in the distant future that\nare less strongly linked with our present part? Derek Parfit famously\nargued that a proper understanding of what we care about when we care\nabout our own future persistence should motivate us to be less\nself-interested and more interested in redistributing resources to\nothers. Endurantists have argued that facts about how we persist\nthrough time underwrite a strong distinction between moral principles\n(which concern what we owe to others now) and prudential rationality\n(which concerns what we owe to our future selves).\n\nAnother interesting line of research uses empirical work in psychology\nto better understand what is happening cognitively when we judge time\nas passing. This is especially pressing for B-theorists, who must\nexplain why time seems to pass in psychologically or rationally\nsignificant ways, even though all passage is really just variation in\nan eternal manifold. Some B-theorists explain the apparent passage of\ntime as an illusion of flow caused by perceptual processes that\nattribute apparent motion to events that happen in sequence. Another,\ncompatible approach considers the way that evolutionary pressures\nmight have shaped emotions and cognitive heuristics to give us a\nstrong past/future distinction in our reasoning.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Brink 2003; Suhler\nand Callender 2012; Parfit 1971; Paul 2010; Prosser 2016; Sullivan\n2018.\n",
