    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods for Children || The Right to Non-Parental Care-Giving\n4.3 The Right to Non-Parental Care-Giving\n\nChildren may have a right to non-parental emotional care received\nwithin enduring, robust, and protected relationships between children\nand adults who are not their parents (Gheaus 2011). Empirical\nliterature seems to indicate that some non-parental care in good\nchildrearing institutions often confers overall benefit to children\nolder than one (Waldfogel 2006). Additional grounds include the\nminimization of the risk of serious failures of care (such as abuse\nand neglect) and a more egalitarian redistribution of opportunities to\ngood care: If all children are exposed to various care-givers and\nstyles of childrearing, it will hopefully be easier for them to\novercome the effects of more minor failings of care (Gheaus 2011).\nFurther, by undermining the parental monopoly of care over children it\nwould diminish objectionable domination of the child (especially\nassuming that non-parental care benefits the child) (Gheaus 2011).\n\nIn particular, if children have long-term non-parental carers\nalongside with parents, they may have better chances to encounter\npeople able to love them. This consideration is particularly important\nif indeed there cannot be a duty to love. It is an interesting\nquestion whether any of the value of the parent-child bond would be\nlost if more than two people were emotionally and responsibly involved\nlong-term in the life of the child. The experience of living and\nloving in extended families and the general belief that the\nparent-child bond is no less valuable in families with many children\nthan in families with one or two children suggest a negative\nanswer.\n",
