    "main_text": "\n\nSubstantivalists believe that there are regions of space or\nspacetime. Many substantivalists also believe that there are entities\n(people, tables, social groups, electrons, fields, holes, events,\ntropes, universals, \u2026) that are located at regions.\nThese philosophers face questions about the relationship between\nlocated entities and the regions at which they are located. Are\nlocated entities identical to their locations, as\nsupersubstantivalists maintain? Are they entirely separate from their\nlocations, in the sense that they share no parts with them?\n\nWithout prejudging these metaphysical questions, some philosophers\nhave formulated logics of location\u2014typically in the form\nof groups of axioms or axiom-schemas governing a location relation and\nits interaction with parthood and other mereological relations. One\nmain aim of these logics is to capture the ways in which the\nmereological properties of and relations between located entities must\nmirror the mereological properties of and relations between the\nlocations of those entities.\n\nThe recent literature focuses largely on three questions, each\ncorresponding to a different way in which the relevant mirroring might\nfail:\n\nSay that two entities interpenetrate just in case\nthey do not share parts but their exact locations do. Is\ninterpenetration possible?\nSay that an extended simple is entity that has no\nproper parts but is exactly located at a region that does have proper\nparts. Are extended simples possible?\nSay that an entity is multilocated just in case\nit is exactly located at more than one region. Is multilocation\npossible?\n\n\nThe present article surveys recent work on these questions and\naddresses a number of other issues along the way.\n",
