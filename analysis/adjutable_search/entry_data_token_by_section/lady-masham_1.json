    "main_text": "A Discourse Concerning the Love of God\n2. A Discourse Concerning the Love of God\n\nNotwithstanding their religious-sounding titles, both of Damaris\nMasham\u2019s books address philosophical issues which were topical\nat the time: love, happiness and moral virtue. In both she offers an\noptimistic view of human beings as rational and social creatures\nmotivated by the love of happiness. This \u201cearliest and strongest\nprinciple,\u201d consists of the enjoyment of pleasure achieved\nthrough the regulatory exercise of reason, which directs us to the\ngreatest happiness.\n\nA Discourse Concerning the Love of God (1696) was written in\nexplicit critique of John Norris, the most important English proponent\nof the philosophy of Nicholas Malebranche. Norris had, in 1690,\nattacked Locke in Cursory Reflections upon a Book Call\u2019d\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding. This may in part explain\nMasham\u2019s hostility to Norris, in spite of the fact that she was\ndedicatee of another book by him: Reflections on the Conduct of\nHuman Life (London, 1690). However, the immediate context for\nA Discourse was the debate about the nature of love, which\nwas a theme in Norris\u2019s writings, especially his Practical\nDiscourses (1691, to which she makes direct reference), and his\ncorrespondence with Mary Astell published as Letters Concerning\nthe Love of God (1695). Lady Masham\u2019s critique of Norris\nand Astell is also aimed, indirectly, at Nicolas Malebranche. Further\nin the background to it was the so-called  Querelle du\nQuietisme, the debate on amour pur [pure love] between\nMalebranche, Fran\u00e7ois de F\u00e9nelon and\nJacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet which was sparked by the mystical\nwritings of Madame Guyon.\n\nNorris had taken an occasionalist position, maintaining that God is\nthe immediate cause of pleasure for us and is therefore the sole and\nproper object of our love. Creatures are therefore merely the\noccasional causes of pleasing effects in us, and our love of creatures\nis inferior and secondary to our love of God. Accordingly he\ndistinguishes two kinds of love: love of God or benevolence and love\nof creatures or concupiscence, claiming that desire only pertains to\nthe love of God. In response Lady Masham denies Norris\u2019s\ndistinction between love of God and love of creatures, insisting that\ndesire pertains to our love of created things. She argues that our\nlove of God comes not from a divinely instilled idea of God in our\nminds, but from observing the world around us, whence we conclude,\nrationally, that we owe love to its creator, God. Her fundamental\nobjection to Norris\u2019s occasionalism is that it undermines the\nbasis of morality because, by denigrating God\u2019s works, it\ndestroys the bonds of human society and the very basis of Christian\nmorality. In opposition to Norris, Lady Masham emphasises the\nimportance of practical morality, arguing that it is integral to\nreligious conduct.\n\nHer affinity with Locke is most apparent in her epistemology. For\ninstance she argues that we derive our knowledge of God by comparing\nideas \u201creceived from Sense and Reflection\u201d and that the\nidea of God is \u201ca Proposition containing many complex Ideas in\nit; and which we are not capable of framing till we have been long\nacquainted with pleasing Sensations\u201d (A Discourse, p.\n66). She also defines love in a Lockean manner as\n\u201ccomplaisance\u201d. A French translation of A\nDiscourse by Pierre Coste was published in Amsterdam in 1705, and\nreviewed in Jean Le Clerc\u2019s Bibliotheque Choisie in the\nsame year. \n",
