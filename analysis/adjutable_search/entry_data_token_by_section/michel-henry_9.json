    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy\n4. Ethics and Political Philosophy\n\nEven if one does not find a systematic development of ethics in the\nfew articles that Henry explicitly devotes to this subject, it is\nnonetheless possible to use these writings as a foundation for an\nethics from the standpoint of his phenomenology of life. Given the\nemphasis that Henry puts on the fundamental nature of life as\naffectivity as well as the tendency toward a forgetting of\nlife\u2019s essence, it seems consistent to ascribe to ethics the\ntask of unmasking and, if possible, overcoming such forgetting. In\nthis sense, Henry\u2019s ethics could be termed an \u201cethics of\naffectivity\u201d (Seyler 2010). Among the possible angles that allow\nfor further development with regard to ethics in Henry\u2019s\nwritings, the three following stand out: 1) the idea that art is\nintrinsically ethical; 2) the critique of contemporary culture through\nthe concept of \u201cbarbarism\u201d; and 3) the concept of religion\nas developed by Henry\u2019s philosophy of Christianity.\n",
