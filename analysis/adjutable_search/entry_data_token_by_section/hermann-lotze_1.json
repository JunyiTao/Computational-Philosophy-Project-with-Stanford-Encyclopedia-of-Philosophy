But the change was slow in coming\nand, well before the full impact of high modernism, Hermann Lotze\nreigned as the single most influential philosopher in Germany, perhaps\neven the world. Although almost completely unread today, his\nsubstantial body of work exemplifies the new academic philosophy\n(\u201cKathederphilosophie\u201d) that flourished between\nthe demise of the post-Kantian idealisms and the rise of scientific\nphilosophy proper; he is usually credited with assisting \u201cthe\nrejection of Hegel and Absolute Idealism within the bounds of academic\nphilosophy\u201d (Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 169). Although the time\nperiod under discussion is sometimes denominated by the phrase\n\u201cbetween idealism and positivism,\u201d it might be more\naccurate to describe it as a transitory stage between the various\nideological groupings of the post-Enlightenment (romanticism,\nmaterialism, et al.) and those diverging philosophical\nmovements that only emerged in modernism proper (logical analysis,\nphenomenology, etc.). Thus, as a prominent figure within an\nessentially transitional period, Lotze\u2019s long shadow was,\nperhaps, predestined to gradually fade from the scene.\n\nWere we unsympathetic, Lotze might be uncharitably (and falsely)\ncaricatured with the appellation \u201cBiedermeier,\u201d\nespecially if one took seriously the oft-repeated charge of\nmethodological eclecticism (implicit in the all-to-common adoption of\n\u201cideal-realism\u201d as an adequate descriptor of Lotze\u2019s\nproject). It is true that Lotze refused to give pride of place to any\nparticular method or theoretical approach. But this fact entails\nneither that Lotze himself possesses no particular method nor that he\ndraws no determinate theoretical conclusions. Lotze\u2019s actual\ntechnique involves, instead, a peculiar dialectic, one which while\nattempting to give consideration to each side of a seeming antinomy,\nresolves ultimately in favor for one side, albeit one which is\nfundamentally transformed. Moreover, Lotze\u2019s\napproach\u2014which takes place against the backdrop of significant\npolitical reaction and social revolution\u2014exhibits a striking\nmodernity in his patient discussions of competing approaches to\nvarious \u201cproblems,\u201d one that proceeds without regard to\ntheir source in physiology, psychology or philosophy of mind. (We\nwould do well to recall that it was precisely to such figures that the\ntask of distinguishing amongst the heady mixture of early\nnineteenth-century science and pseudo-science fell.) His seminal\ninterventions, according to one of his students, belong to \u201ca\nperiod of transition and uncertainty; much of the light which the\npreceding age thought it possessed has vanished and the new light has\nnot yet dawned\u201d (Merz, 1907\u201314, p. 493). Accordingly,\nLotze\u2019s work looks both forward and backward, anticipating both\nthe methods and the emphases of the new philosophical spirit while\nclinging, nonetheless, to certain key assumptions of the very romantic\nWeltanschauung (cf. Richards, 2002) that he helped\n(ultimately) to undo.\n\nIt would be useful to further note something else that might appear,\nat first glance, as purely trivial; this is the critical shift in tone\nand temper, from the prior hostile and polemical one, to one much more\ntentative and hesitant effected by Lotze:\n\nIn his reviews, criticisms, and polemical writings he is as dignified\nas Kant and Herbart had been; he is never impolite as Fichte and\nSchelling frequently were; nor does he fasten upon his opponents any\nstigma as Hegel frequently succeeded in doing; he is quite above that\nvirulent and unmannerly invective by which Schopenhauer tries to\ncrush, but never actually damages, the arguments of thinkers whom he\nchooses to regard as enemies. But the style of Lotze reflects one\ncharacteristic trait of modern thought. The confidence and\nself-assurance of Kant, Fichte, Hegel. Schopenhauer, and of the\nearlier Schelling have disappeared. (Merz, 1907\u201314, p. 493)\n\n\nThe new model of the academic researcher demands the replacement of\nprominent personalities\u2014i.e., romantic\n\u2018geniuses\u2019\u2014by the new exemplar of the sober\nscientist. Significant, as well, are the new material constraints on\nthe practice of philosophy: not just the rise of the university\nprofessor\u2014after Kant\u2014as the most prominent representative\nfigure, but the correlative emergence of the professional journal as\nthe typical venue of presentation and publication. Of course, the\natmosphere of political repression, following the failed revolutions\nof 1815 and 1848, surely played a crucial role in limiting the wider\nambitions of philosophers and reinforcing the need for a more neutral\ntenor. Indeed, the same political pressures and bureaucratic demands\nassociated with the state professor\u2019s status as \u201ccivil\nservant\u201d began to figure prominently during the first half of\nthe nineteenth century, harkening back to the Fichte\u2019s\ndifficulties in the Atheismusstreit (1798/99) and leading up\nto, among other things, the dismissal of the \u201cG\u00f6ttingen\nSeven\u201d (1837)\u2014just to enumerate a few salient events from\nthe German situation alone.\n\nThe efficient causes of this portentous change were not limited to the\nsocial-political sphere: in the numerous departments that came to make\nup the philosophical, or lower, faculty of the university, other\nimportant developments were also afoot. First, and foremost, there\nmust be numbered the emergence of new, separate disciplines\u2014such\nas geology, chemistry, biology and psychology\u2014and the resulting\nsquabbles over relative positions, proper boundaries, and the\nsubsequent agon of \u201crole purification\u201d (see\nKusch, 1995). In addition, the rapid advances in the scientific\ndiscovery had multiplied the previously manageable amounts of data\nand, hence, suggested to some that the task of philosophy was now to\nrestrict itself to explaining \u201chow the problems of speculation\nstill connect themselves with the ever increasing mass of special\nknowledge that the labours of the new generation have\naccumulated\u201d (Adamson, 1885b, p. 573). In this context, the\ncognate conceptions of philosophy as a synthesizing or supervisory\nendeavor began to gather adherents. Indeed, the \u201crehabilitation\nof philosophy\u201d [Rehabilitierung der Philosophie] (see\nSchn\u00e4delbach, 1984, pp. 103ff) is perhaps the central\nfoundational issue of the day and names \u201cthe attempt to allot to\nphilosophy, in a scientific age, a domain of problems that would be\nindependent of the special sciences\u201d (ibid., p. 103).\nHere, as elsewhere, Lotze emulates Fichte: while science can surely\nexplain what is, it can never elucidate the ultimate value or meaning\nof the phenomena it reveals\u2014that alone is the task of philosophy\n(cf. ibid., p. 178).\n\nOddly\u2014despite his one-time pre\u00ebminence\u2014Lotze founded\nno enduring school. However, his teaching directly influenced such\nprominent students as Windelband and Frege and his ideas were still\nbeing considered and debated as late as the 1920s by a numerous\nnotables, including Heidegger and Carnap. Even in his own day,\nLotze\u2019s reputation soon spread beyond the continent. As a\nresult, he became a substantial force in the English-speaking world\naffecting, among others, Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet, in Britain,\nand Royce, James, and Santayana, in America. Indeed, it is principally\nby this latter means that he came to hold some sway with both the\nearly Moore and the early Russell. Furthermore, because his influence\nextended through both Anglo-America and the Continent, some have\npostulated his unconscious but seminal presence in the emergence of\nanalytic philosophy (cf. Sluga, 1980, Gabriel, 2002, Milkov, 2000);\nand, likewise, studies of Lotze by historians of phenomenology\n(Rollinger, 2001, Hauser, 2003) have also begun to emerge.\n\nFinally, in this same moment, when philosophy was only beginning its\n(eventual and complete) confinement to the academy\u2014and becoming\nsimultaneously more specialized and less provincial\u2014Lotze was\n(notably) the darling of numerous Protestant theologians and\npreachers: both conservatives who sought to popularize him as a\nfanatical opponent of mid-century materialism, and others, of a more\nliberal character, who fastened on to his \u201cpersonalism\u201d as\nthe proper antidote to the dangerous heterodoxies of pantheism,\nrationalism, agnosticism and atheism (cf. Hall, 1912, pp. 94n-96n).\nWhile Lotze himself may not have endorsed these distortions, there\nwas, nonetheless, something about his work that permitted such misuse.\nSantayana, a keen observer of this very phenomena, insisted on\ninserting an important cautionary note: he remarked dryly that one\nought not to be misled by Lotze\u2019s continuous reference to\n\u201csouls\u201d or \u201cGod\u201d as \u201ca certain\nacceptance which Lotze has found in conservative circles is perhaps\ndue to insufficient considerations of his meaning\u201d:\n\nLotze is inclined to give old names to new things; he is fond of a\nmetaphysical nomenclature, and his terms are generally more mysterious\nand old-fashioned than his ideas. Thus he speaks of the soul, of\nsubstance, of free will, of efficient causation, of a personal God;\nbut these phrases stand in his system for comparatively modest and\nlegitimate conceptions. The words may please us in themselves; but we\nshall be disappointed if we welcome the things for love of the names\nthey bear. (Santayana, 1971, p. 153)\n\n\nIf correct, this suggests that Lotze, once again, followed the lead of\nFichte in using traditional language to mask more deeply naturalistic\nconceptions than the surface meaning of the ordinary wording might\ninitially suggest. (This peculiar feature of the expression of his\nthought must be made continually present by the active reader.) In any\nevent, Lotze\u2019s continuing influence in the twentieth century\n(ironically) came mostly through the theological curriculum of\nclassical liberal Protestantism, still in evidence until the\nlate-1960s (cf. Reardon, 1968).\n\nAlthough it is tempting to regard the Post-Enlightenment period as a\nconfused interregnum, serving only as a prelude to the revolutionary\nbreakthroughs of philosophical modernism \u2013 that is, those\nmovements that organized and flourished after the Great War \u2013\nthe fact is that Lotze (and in particular the Logik) was\nstill a relevant and wholly viable topic for philosophical seminars\nwell into the 1920s. As a result, there is a related trend that augurs\nfor treating Lotze as if he were a contemporary and thus subjecting\nhim to our own expectations and standards. On those terms, however,\nLotze presents mostly an unappealing and enigmatic tangle.\n\nThe only viable way to proceed is to see him as consciously continuing\nto practice some of the sly deception and willful obfuscation of those\nEnlightenment thinkers still subject to vigorous state repression and\nsocial persecution. For this tack there are, of course, a grab bag of\ntechniques, on display in a wide variety of modern thought, that all\nresult in the same, highly desired end: plausible deniability. Without\ncultivating our own sensitivity to the highly provocative nature of\ncontroversies that to our minds may be considered settled, we cannot\nsee how Lotze attempts to subtly open up the minds of his readers to\nany number of heterodox possibilities.\n\nThe name naturally associated with this sort of inquiry is, of course,\nthat of Leo Strauss. Yet the work of his students invariably comes to\nan end with post-Enlightenment thinkers, terminating typically at the\nend of the Enlightenment, with \u201cRousseau, Lessing, and\nKant\u201d (Strauss, 1988, p. 33). But if we consider that a further\nline of repression runs from Fichte up to the widespread institutional\nsuccesses of the neo-Kantians, on the continent, and the British\nIdealists, elsewhere, then Lotze is situated squarely in this\ninterregnum. It thus seems natural to wonder if the state actions of\nthe sort noted above, when combined with the obvious sensitivities of\nthe university appointment process, may not have suggested to Lotze\nthat a certain circumspection and discretion might still provide the\noutlines of the best course of action. In a period of political\nreaction and repression, civil servants needed to proceed cautiously\n(compare Beiser, 2014, pp. 178ff).\n\nTo this purpose, the structure of the entry now takes the following\nform: first, an investigation of three controversies, addressed by\nLotze (that are, quite naturally, not controversies for us); second,\nan exposition of three contributions Lotze made to the academic\ndiscipline of philosophy, which are incorporated, sometimes as wholes,\nsometimes in parts, usually unacknowledged, by the modernist movements\nthat displaced him; and, finally, a discussion, naturally somewhat\nspeculative and incomplete, as to the ways that, faute de\nmieux, Lotze still exerts an underground influence on issues of\nsome undisputed currency. These I deem his \u201clegacies.\u201d\n\nNow that our own new century is well underway, [u]nderstanding and\nincorporating the insights and achievements of the twentieth century\nreturn us, perforce, to their roots in the prior century. But so long\nas the nineteenth century remains \u201cstill the most obscure of all\nthe centuries of the modern age up to now\u201d (Heidegger, 1977, pp.\n139\u2013140), even the true significance of our present endeavors\nmay remain yet unknown and unknowable to us. The only alternative is\nblank incomprehension, the sort already possible within about fifty\nyears of his death; for when Wittgenstein\u2019s student Drury\ncomplained about the inclusion of Lotze as a special author in the\nsecond part of his Tripos, Wittgenstein could only reply:\n\u201cProbably a man who shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to write\nphilosophy\u201d (Rhees, 1981, p. 121).\n",
