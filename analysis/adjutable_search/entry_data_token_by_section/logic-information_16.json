    "main_text": "Special topics\n5. Special topics\n\nThere is a varied list of special topics pertaining to the logical\napproach to information. This section briefly illustrates just a\ncouple of them, which are important regardless of the particular\nstance one takes (information as range, as correlation, as code). The\nfirst topic is the issue of informational equivalence: when are two\nstructures in the logical approach one is using indistinguishable in\nterms of the information they are meant to encode, convey, or carry?\nAnd, when should two pieces of information be taken as equivalent or\nnot? The answers to this last question touch on the issue of how\ninformation (or information carriers, or information supporters) can\nbe combined or structured. This, in turn, has an impact on the\nproperties logical connectives are expected to behave. The second\ntopic in this section focuses on one of the connectives. Namely, it\nconcerns the various ways in which the idea of negative\ninformation can be understood conceptually, and properly dealt with\nformally.\n",
