    "main_text": "The logic of negation || Other conceptions of negation as a unary connective\n2.4 Other conceptions of negation as a unary connective\n\nThere are several other approaches to negation that build on quite\ndifferent ideas of expressing semantic opposition. A meta-level\nconception of negation, for example, is the so-called negation\nas failure that has been developed in logic programming. The\nseminal paper Clark 1978 suggests the higher-level negation as failure\nrule (in a slightly irritating notation): \\(\\vdash \\osim \\vdash p\n\\mbox{ infer } \\vdash \\osim p\\). The idea is that \\(\\osim p\\) may be\ninferred if the exhaustive search for a proof of the atomic statement\n\\(p\\) failed.\n\nIn Hintikka\u2019s (1973) game-theoretical semantics, negation is\nmodeled by a role-switch between two players in a semantic game (cf.\nthe entry on\n logic and games).\n A geometrical intuition of negation as inversion can\nbe found in a paper by Ramsey, who suggested that\n\n\n[w]e might, for instance, express negation not by inserting a word\n\u201cnot\u201d, but by writing what we negate upside down. Such a\nsymbolism is only inconvenient because we are not trained to perceive\ncomplicated symmetry about a horizontal axis, and if we adopted it, we\nshould be rid of the redundant \u201cnot-not\u201d, for the result\nof negating the sentence \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d twice would be simply the\nsentence \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d itself. (F.P. Ramsey 1927,\n161\u20132)\n\n\nThe idea of negation as the inversion of arrangements of truth values,\nsuch as truth value polygons, has been developed in Varzi and Warglien\n2003, see also Shramko and Wansing 2011 for negation as\norder-inversion in a logic of generalized truth values.\n\nIn order to extend Dummett\u2019s verificationism (cf., e.g., Dummett\n1996) from mathematical to empirical discourse, a notion of\n\u201cempirical negation\u201d has been suggested (see De 2011,\n2013). A formula \\(\\osim A\\) is read as \u201c\\(A\\) is not warranted\nby our current state of evidence\u201d and it is evaluated with\nrespect to a distinguished base state \\(g\\) in a model \\(\\cal M\\):\n\\({\\cal M}, w \\models \\osim A\\) iff \\({\\cal M}, g \\not \\models\nA\\).\n\nThe supplement document\n \u201cAdditional Conceptions of Negation as a Unary Connective\u201d\n briefly addresses the following approaches, where negation will be\ndenoted as \\(\\neg\\) (if not stated otherwise):\n\nNegation as the Routley star\nThe notion of Routley star negation is more general than the\nnotion of empirical negation. The Routley star is a unary function\n\\(^*\\) on possible worlds that delegates the semantic evaluation of a\nnegated formula \\(\\neg A\\) at a world or state \\(w\\) to the state\n\\(w^*\\): \\(\\neg A\\) is true at a \\(w\\) in a model \\(\\cal M\\) iff \\(A\\)\nis not true at \\(w^*\\) in \\(\\cal M\\).\nNegation as inconsistency\nThe notion of negation as inconsistency is based on the idea that\nthe negation of \\(A\\) expresses that \\(A\\) implies (or allows to\nderive) something absurd or even something\n\u201cunwanted\u201d.\nNegation as contradictoriness\nThe idea of negation as contradictoriness is to explicate negation\nby understanding \\(\\neg A\\) as the contradictory of \\(A\\), where the\nrelationship of contradiction may be defined in terms of certain\nlogical laws, such as the Law of Excluded Middle and the Law of\nNon-Contradiction.\nNegation as falsity\nAccording to negation as falsity, the negation \\(\\neg A\\) of \\(A\\)\nexpresses that \\(A\\) is definitely false. This approach to negation is\nrelated to the view that a proof of \\(\\neg A\\) is a direct\nfalsification of \\(A\\).\nNegation as cancellation\nNegation as cancellation develops the idea that the content of the\nproposition expressed by \\(\\neg A\\) erases or annihilates the content\nof the proposition expressed by \\(A\\).\nNegation by iteration\nThe idea of negation by iteration is to obtain a negation by a\ndouble application of a connective called \u201cdemi-negation\u201d\nin Humberstone 1995, 2000b, or \u201csquare root of negation\u201d\nin quantum computational logic, \\(\\sqrt{{\\tt not}}\\), see, for recent\nreferences, Dalla Chiara, Giuntini, Leporini, and Sergioli 2018, Paoli\n2019, and the entry on\n sentence connectives in formal logic.\n This clearly reminds one of the duplex negatio negat in\nnegative concord, see\n Section 1.8.2.\nPerfect negation\nPerfect negation is a rather restrictive notion of negation that\nhas been developed by Avron (1999, 2002) in terms of proof-theoretical\nas well as semantic conditions.\n\n",
