    "main_text": "\n\nMost philosophers believe that, other things being equal, simpler\ntheories are better. But what exactly does theoretical simplicity\namount to? Syntactic simplicity, or elegance, measures the number and\nconciseness of the theory\u2019s basic principles. Ontological simplicity,\nor parsimony, measures the number of kinds of entities postulated by\nthe theory. One issue concerns how these two forms of simplicity\nrelate to one another. There is also an issue concerning the\njustification of principles, such as Occam\u2019s Razor, which favor simple\ntheories. The history of philosophy has seen many approaches to\ndefending Occam\u2019s Razor, from the theological justifications of the\nEarly Modern period, to contemporary justifications employing results\nfrom probability theory and statistics.\n",
