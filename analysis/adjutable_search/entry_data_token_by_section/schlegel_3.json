    "main_text": "Philosophical Apprenticeship: Schlegel on Idealism and Transcendental Philosophy\n4. Philosophical Apprenticeship: Schlegel on Idealism and Transcendental Philosophy\n\nLike many other members of the generation which came intellectually of\nage in the 1790s\u2014a group which includes not only the idealist\nphilosophers Schelling and Hegel but also the poets Novalis and\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2014Schlegel\u2019s philosophical interests were framed\naround a concern for somehow uniting Fichtean freedom of the subject\nwith Spinozistic holism. It is likely that Schlegel attended Fichte\u2019s\nWissenschaftslehre (Theory of Scientific Knowledge)\n\u201cnova methodo\u201d lectures in Jena starting in October 1796,\nand he was guided at least in part in his study of the new idealistic\nphilosophy by Novalis, whose own Fichte Studies represent a\nfascinating window onto the effect that Fichte had on this generation.\nNovalis and Schlegel had a famous conversation about idealism in the\nsummer of 1796, and both attempted to articulate an opposition to the\nreliance on a single first principle which they thought characterized\nthe philosophical efforts of Reinhold and Fichte to set Kantian\nphilosophy on a systematic basis. (This Romantic contribution to the\nanti-foundationalist Grundsatzkritik of the 1790\u2019s has long\nbeen a neglected aspect of research on the development of German\nIdealism, as has the work of those philosophers\u2014such as Immanuel\nNiethammer, Carl Immanuel Diez, Johann Benjamin Erhard and Friedrich\nKarl Forberg\u2014who pursued a similar line of thought against\nReinhold and Fichte.)\n\nPhilosophers interested in Schlegel\u2019s early engagement with the\nproblems of German Idealism have, in addition to his published works,\ntwo rich but tantalizingly incomplete textual resources to draw upon:\na set of fragments, the so-called \u201cPhilosophical\nApprenticeship\u201d (Philosophische Lehrjahre), which date\nfrom 1796 and reveal Schlegel\u2019s study not only of Fichte and Spinoza\nbut also of Winckelmann, Herder and Kant (this collection remained\nunpublished until the critical Schlegel edition of 1963), and notes\nfrom Schlegel\u2019s Lectures on Transcendental Philosophy at Jena\nin 1800\u201301.\n\nSchlegel\u2019s critique of first-principle philosophy is rooted (like\nNovalis\u2019) in a sense of the ungraspability of the absolute or\nunconditioned. (As Novalis puts it in the first of his\n\u201cPollen\u201d fragments: \u201cEverywhere we seek the\nunconditioned [das Unbedingte], but find only things\n[Dinge].\u201d) More specifically, Schlegel holds, against\nReinhold and Fichte, that \u201cthere are no first principles that\nare universally suitable [zweckm\u00e4ssig] companions and\nguides to truth\u201d (KA XVIII.518, #13): even\n\u201cself-evident\u201d propositions can be doubted and so require\ndemonstration (thus opening up an infinite regress), and any\nproposition can be proved in an \u201cinfinite\u201d number of ways.\nFor Schlegel \u201cevery proof is infinitely perfectible\u201d\n(KA XVIII, 518, #9), and the task of philosophy is not one of\nsearching to find an unconditioned first principle but rather one of\nengaging in an (essentially coherentist) process of infinite\nprogression and approximation.\n\nPhilosophy on Schlegel\u2019s view must thus begin with skepticism and tend\ntoward the absolute; the idealists have found no way to the latter\nthat avoids the difficulties of the former. Against Fichte\u2019s attempts\nat system-building, Schlegel proposes a notion of what he calls an\nalternating proof (Wechselerweis): \u201cIn my system the\nultimate principle [der letzte Grund] is actually a\nreciprocal proof [Wechselerweis]. In Fichte\u2019s [it is] a\npostulate and a conditional proposition\u201d (KA XVIII,\n521).\n\nThe Schlegelian philosophy that results from this engagement with\nidealism is non-foundationalist, holistic and historical (see Beiser\n2003, 123\u201326). Schlegel himself describes his philosophical\napproach as resembling both a circle and epic poetry because it must\nforever \u201cbegin in the middle\u201d: \u201cPhilosophy must have\nat its basis not only an alternating proof [Wechselbeweis]\nbut also an alternating concept [Wechselbegriff]. In the case\nof every concept, as in the case of every proof, one can in turn ask\nfor a concept and a proof of the same. For this reason, philosophy,\nlike an epic poem, must start in the middle, and it is impossible to\npursue philosophy piece by piece starting from a first piece which is\ngrounded and explained completely in and through itself. It is a\nwhole, and thus the path to recognizing it is no straight line but a\ncircle\u201d (KA XVIII, 518).\n\nRecent work has emphasized the Kantian inheritance that lies behind\nSchlegel\u2019s notions of irony (Rush 2016, who sees Schlegel as\nradicalizing Kantian regulativism in a way that makes it \u201cmore\ncontingent, historical and pragmatic\u201d) and of a\n\u201cprogressive universal poetry\u201d (Ameriks 2014). Others have\nstressed the importance of Schlegel\u2019s philosophical work in ways\nthat open up his broader concerns with life and the world of organic\nbeings ( see the discussion of Schlegel\u2019s later work in Section\n6 below, as well as Gorodeisky 2011 and Nassar 2014, 2015). As argued\nbelow, these larger interests can be seen particularly in\nSchlegel\u2019s contributions to ethical, social and political\nphilosophy.\n",
