What Kinds of Health Care Do We Owe Each Other?\n\nOn the fair equality of opportunity view, meeting the health needs of\nall persons, viewed as free and equal citizens, is of comparable and\nspecial moral importance. (If \u201ccitizens\u201d is taken broadly\nto include all members of a community, then arguably long-term\nunauthorized immigrants should be included (Daniels and Ladin\nforthcoming). Specifically, since meeting health needs protects the\nrange of opportunities people can exercise, then any social\nobligations we have to protect opportunity imply obligations to\nprotect and promote health (normal functioning) for all people.\nVarious recent theories of justice, despite their differences, affirm\nthat we have such social obligations to protect opportunity, and so\nthey converge on the importance of protecting health.\n\nOn the opportunity-based view, justice requires that we protect\npeople\u2019s shares of the normal opportunity range by treating\nillness when it occurs, by reducing the risk of disease and disability\nbefore they occur, and by distributing those risks equitably. Within\nthe medical system, this means we must give all people access to a\nreasonable array of services that promote and restore normal\nfunctioning and we must not neglect preventive measures in favor of\ncurative ones. It means we must look beyond the medical system to\ntraditional public health measures that profoundly affect risk levels\nand their distribution. We must also look beyond the health sector to\nthe broader social determinants of health and their distribution.\nSince we cannot meet all the health needs that arise inside or outside\nthe health sector, we must be accountable for the reasonableness of\nthe resource allocation decisions we make.\n\nThe alternative views noted in the previous section arguably have\nnarrower scope, though some may be more expandable than others.\nDworkin\u2019s prudential insurance approach might have the same\nscope as the opportunity-based view if the insurance policy that\n(most?) prudent buyers purchase includes protections against health\nrisks that go beyond treatments for illness. Dworkin is not explicit\nabout how that broader policy might be designed. What can be purchased\nin any case is constrained by the level of resources available in the\nequality of resources approach, and Dworkin is sensitive to the fact\nthat some purchasers may disagree about what prudence requires.\nGibbard\u2019s prudent insurance buyers presumably work with a\nsmaller premium unless a decent economic minimum is equal to what we\nget on the equal resources view. Gibbard is more explicitly talking\nonly about insurance for medical services, and it might be harder to\nexpand his account to one that meets health needs more broadly.\nBuchanan\u2019s decent minimum quite deliberately meets fewer health\nneeds than the opportunity-based view.\n\nConsider more specifically what the opportunity-based account of\njustice and health care requires by way of preventive services. It\nrequires (1) reducing the risk of disease and (2) seeking an equitable\ndistribution of those risks. The first requirement is obvious. It is\noften more effective to prevent disease and disability than it is to\ncure them when they occur (or to compensate individuals for loss of\nfunction, where cure is not possible). Cost-effectiveness arguments\nwill have some bearing on claims about the appropriate distribution of\nacute vs. preventive measures (Russell 1986). Since it is better in\ngeneral to avoid the burdens of disease than to reduce them once they\noccur, many types of preventive measures will be given prominence in a\nsystem governed by the opportunity-based account.\n\nThe second requirement should also seem obvious, especially in light\nof what we know about the importance of the social determinants of\nhealth. Consider the point from the perspective of occupational\nhealth. Suppose a health-care system is heavily weighted toward acute\ncare and that it provides equal access to its services. Thus anyone\nwith severe respiratory ailments\u2014black lung, brown lung,\nasbestosis, emphysema, and so on\u2014is given adequate comprehensive\nmedical services as needed, but little is done to reduce exposures to\nrisk in the workplace. Does the system meet the demands of\njustice?\n\nSuch a system is incomplete and unjust, according to the fair equality\nof opportunity view. If some groups in the population are\ndifferentially at risk of getting ill, it is not sufficient merely to\nattend to their illnesses. Where risk of illness differs\nsystematically in ways that are avoidable, guaranteeing equal\nopportunity requires that we try to eliminate the differential risks\nand to prevent the excess illness experienced by those at avoidable,\ngreater risk (of course subject to resource limits and fair process in\nsetting limits). Otherwise the burdens and risks of illness will fall\ndifferently on different groups, and the risk of impaired opportunity\nfor those groups will remain, despite the efforts to provide acute\ncare. Care is not equivalent to prevention. Some disease will not be\ndetected in time for it to be cured. Some is not curable, even if it\nis preventable, and treatments will vary in efficacy. We protect equal\nopportunity best by reducing and equalizing the risk of these\nconditions arising. The fact that we get an equal chance of being\ncured once ill because of equitable access to care does not compensate\nus for our unequal chances of becoming ill.\n\nFor these reasons, the fair equality of opportunity account places\nspecial importance on measures aimed at the equitable distribution of\nthe risks of disease. Reduction in carbon emissions aimed at keeping\nthe global temperature increases within a reasonable limit could\nreduce the chances of climate change increasing the risk of disease\nfor all; even if the risk of disease to individuals is unequal from\nclimate change, health inequities makes reducing carbon emissions like\nother public health measures. For example, some public-health\nmeasures, such as water and waste treatment, have the general effect\nof reducing risk. But historically, they have also had the effect of\nequalizing risk between socioeconomic classes and between groups\nliving in different geographical areas. Similarly, many other\nenvironmental measures, such as recent clean air laws and pesticide\nregulations, have both general effects on risk reduction and specific\neffects on the distribution of risks. For example, pollutants emitted\nfrom smokestacks have a different effect on people who live downwind\nfrom those who live upwind. Gasoline lead emissions have greater\neffect on urban than rural populations. But other health-protection\nmeasures primarily have an effect on the distribution of risks: the\nregulation of workplace health hazards is perhaps the clearest\nexample. Only some groups of workers are at risk from workplace\nhazards, though many workers face some risk or other, especially in\nmanufacturing settings. Just health requires that stringent regulation\nin all of these ways must be part of the health-care system.\n\nWhat other sorts of social policies should governments pursue in order\nto reduce inequalities in health risks, especially in light of what we\nnow know about the social determinants of health? The menu of options\nshould include policies aimed at equalizing individual life\nopportunities, such as investment in basic education and other early\nchildhood interventions, affordable housing, income security, and\nother forms of antipoverty policy. We know, for example, that early\ninterventions aimed at child development, like the Perry High/Scope\nProject (Schweinhardt et al. 1993), have lasting effects on\neducational achievement, employment, marriage, and the reduction of\nmental illness. The War on Poverty Program Head Start produced lasting\neffects on educational achievement; educational achievement, in turn,\nhas a direct influence on health behavior in adulthood, including\ndiet, smoking, and physical activity (Acheson et al. 1998). Other\npolicies that might reduce differential risk could explore changes in\nthe degree of control and authority workers have in the workplace\n(Marmot et al. 1997). Even broader interventions, including addressing\ninequalities in the distribution of wealth, power, and resources, are\nrecommended by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health\n(2010). Though the connection between these broad, intersectoral\nsocial policies and health may seem somewhat remote, and they are\nrarely linked to issues of health in our public policy discussions,\ngrowing evidence suggests that they should be so linked.\n\nOne central implication of this view about health for all is that\nthere should be universal access, based on health needs, to whatever\narray of public health and personal medical services provides support\nfor fair equality of opportunity under reasonable resource\nconstraints. This implication must be unpacked since health needs are\nmet in various ways, through public health as well as personal medical\nservices.\n\nPublic health services promote the conditions that reduce certain\nrisks of disease or disability. They reduce risks by assuring a clean\nand safe living and working environment and by providing protection\nagainst infectious diseases. These services should attend to the risks\nfaced by the entire population and aim to reduce risks in an equitable\nfashion.\n\nHowever much we can reduce risks to population health and do so in an\nequitable fashion, some people will still become ill or disabled and\nrequire personal medical services or other forms of social support\nthat compensate for the effects of loss of function. Even if the\nproper arrangement of the social determinants of health and adequate\nattention to public health greatly reduce the burden of disease and\ndisability in a society, most people will still need medical care at\nvarious points in their lives, especially as they age. To protect the\nrange of opportunities for those whose loss of normal functioning we\ncannot prevent, we will have to devote some significant resources to\nsuch medical and social support services. Obviously, careful\ndeliberation in a fair process will be needed to determine the proper\nallocation of resources to prevention vs. cure and social support.\n\nPersonal medical services that are deemed essential to promoting fair\nopportunity for all must be accessible to all. Specifically, this will\ngenerally mean \u201cuniversal coverage\u201d through some form of\npublic or private insurance for services deemed to be a\n\u201cdecent\u201d or \u201cadequate\u201d array, as required by\nthe appeal to the underlying concept of protecting fair equality of\nopportunity. There should be no obstacles\u2014financial, racial,\ngeographical, and so on\u2014to access to the basic tier of the\nsystem. Determining what is in that basic tier must be clarified in\nlight of arguments about how to protect fair equality of opportunity\nunder reasonable resource constraints, and these arguments require a\nfair process (accountability for reasonableness) in which appropriate\ndemocratic deliberation can take place. The theory rules out arbitrary\nexclusions of whole categories of kinds of services that meet needs of\nthe sort that should be met in the basic tier. Historically, for\nexample, preventive services, mental health care, rehabilitative, and\nlong-term care services have been excluded from both public and\nprivate insurance schemes, for various cultural and economic reasons.\nMost of these \u201ccategorical\u201d exclusions are unjustifiable\nfrom the perspective of protecting normal functioning, but specific\nlimit-setting choices can only be made through a fair, deliberative\nprocess.\n\nJust what forms of organization\u2014public or private administration\nand financing\u2014are implied is not a question to which the\nopportunity-based account of justice and health provides a unique\nanswer. There is probably an array of \u201cjust-enough\u201d\ninstitutional structures that can provide the needed protection of\nopportunity. Similarly, just what kinds of \u201ctiering\u201d or\ninequalities in services above the basic tier are compatible with\nprotecting opportunity for all may not get specific answers from the\ngeneral theory, though it will clearly supply constraints. Reasonable\ndisagreements about these questions should be addressed in a fair\ndeliberative process.\n",
