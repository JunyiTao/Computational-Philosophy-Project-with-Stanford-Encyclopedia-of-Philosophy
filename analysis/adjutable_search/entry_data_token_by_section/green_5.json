    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology || Self-Consciousness and Epistemic Responsibility\n2.4 Self-Consciousness and Epistemic Responsibility\n\nMuch of the first book of the Prolegomena is concerned with\nthe role of self-consciousness in apparently discrete episodes of\nexperience in individual minds. But Green is also concerned with the\nrole of self-consciousness in knowledge. For the most part,\nnon-rational animals accept the way things appear to them\u2014their\ndoxastic impulses. If they reason, they select instrumental means to\nthe satisfaction of their desires, but they do not reason about\nwhether things are as they appear. They lack the capacity to distance\nthemselves from their appearances, to assess the credentials of their\ndoxastic impulses, and to assent to appearances for good reasons.\nBrutes may often have true appearances, but they are not\nepistemically responsible with respect to their appearances.\nOn the assumption that knowledge requires something like epistemic\nresponsibility, and not just true belief, Green argues that knowledge\nrequires self-consciousness, inasmuch as epistemic responsibility\npresupposes self-consciousness. For epistemic responsibility requires\na cognizer to be able to pose the question of whether she should\nassent to an appearance and to assess the reasons for assent by\nrelating this appearance to other elements of her consciousness.\nIndeed, any extended piece of reasoning requires consciousness of\ndifferent appearances as parts of a single system. For instance, I\nrecognize and trust the results of previous deliberations as premises\nin my present deliberations. This requires a self that is conscious of\nand synthesizes a set of appearances. On this view, knowledge\npresupposes epistemic responsibility which presupposes\nself-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a784, 120, 125). This link\nbetween knowledge and self-consciousness via epistemic responsibility\nis arguably the most important metaphysical claim for understanding\nGreen\u2019s ethical argument in the rest of the\nProlegomena.\n",
