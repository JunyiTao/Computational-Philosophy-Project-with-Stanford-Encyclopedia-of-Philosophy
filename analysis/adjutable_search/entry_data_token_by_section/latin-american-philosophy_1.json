    "main_text": "The Contemporary Period\n2. The Contemporary Period\n\nContemporary Latin American philosophy begins in the twentieth\ncentury, around 1910, coinciding with the decline of positivism. By\n1930, the remaining positivists in Latin America were usually regarded\nas museum pieces rather than proponents of a viable philosophy meriting\nserious attention. The contemporary, post-positivist period can be\ndivided into three distinct sub-periods. The\nfirst\u2014rebellion\u2014is characterized by the backlash\nagainst positivism and the subsequent development of foundations for\nfuture philosophical movements (ca.1910\u20131940). The\nsecond\u2014normalcy\u2014is characterized by the\nachievement of a degree of institutionalization and normalization in\nthe philosophical profession (1940\u20131960). The third\nperiod\u2014maturity (ca. 1960 to the present)\u2014is\ndistinguished by the degree of professional and philosophical maturity\nattained by Latin American philosophers.\n",
