Human Nature (xing \u6027)\n\nChapter\n 23,[2]\n \u201cHuman Nature is Evil\u201d (Xing\u2019e\n\u6027\u60e1), is a reasonable point of entry into Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy for multiple reasons: it exemplifies some of the textual\nproblems mentioned above; it addresses one of the core themes of the\ncollection; and it was, for centuries, the most frequently cited\nsection of Xunzi.\n\nFirst, the two keywords need to be unpacked. Xing, commonly\ntranslated as \u201chuman nature\u201d, is a term of uncertain\netymology that earlier philosophers had used in subtly dissimilar\nways. Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE?), for example, used it to refer to\nthe ideal state than an organism is expected to attain under the right\nconditions, or perhaps an innate tendency toward that state (Graham\n1989: 117\u201332; Graham 1990: 7\u201366). Famously, Mencius argued\nthat the xing of human beings is good (shan\n\u5584), by which he meant that all human beings have the\ncapacity to become good, even though, in reality, not all people\nare good, because they fail to exert themselves sufficiently\u2014or\neven take the obligation seriously.\n\nIn Xunzi, \u201cHuman Nature is Evil\u201d is framed as an\nargument with Mencius (who was probably long dead), and takes the view\nthat the xing of human beings is the very opposite of\nshan, namely e. The basic meaning of e is\nclose to \u201cdetestable\u201d (as a transitive verb, wu\n\u60e1 means \u201cto hate\u201d); the translation\n\u201cevil\u201d is acceptable only with the understanding that\nsomething like an Augustinian conception of evil is not intended.\n(Some scholars opt for \u201cbad\u201d, another standard antonym of\n\u201cgood\u201d in English.) But in prosecuting this position,\nXunzi uses xing in a fundamentally different sense:\n\u201cWhat is so by birth is called xing\u201d\n(Xunzi\n 22.1b).[3]\n Thus xing refers to the basic faculties, capacities, and\ndesires that we have from birth, which cannot be called\n\u201cgood\u201d because following the impulses of our\nxing, without reflecting on them and moderating them, will\nlead us to act harmfully (Hutton 2000; Tang 2016: 51).\n\nIn effect, both Xunzi and Mencius argued that human beings all have\nthe capacity to become good, even though some people develop this\ncapacity and others do not (Graham 1989: 250; Shun 1997:\n222\u201331). The main differences, only recently appreciated, are\nthat they were not operating with the same implicit definitions of\nxing, and Xunzi\u2019s recommendations for moral\nself-cultivation\u2014that is, how to overcome one\u2019s inherently\ndetestable nature\u2014were more complex than Mencius\u2019s, as we\nshall see. Because of Mencius\u2019s subsequent prestige, it was\ncommonly supposed that Xunzi\u2019s definition of xing was\nheterodox, if not deliberately subversive. But a collection of\nConfucian manuscripts recently excavated from a tomb near the modern\ntown of Guodian \u90ed\u5e97 and dated to ca. 300 BCE suggests\nthat it may have been Mencius\u2019s usage of xing,\nnot Xunzi\u2019s, which was considered eccentric in ancient\n times.[4]\n The Guodian text called The Xing\nEmerges from the Endowment (Xing zi ming chu\n\u6027\u81ea\u547d\u51fa) defines xing in a manner\nvery similar to Xunzi: the set of inborn characteristics shared by all\nmembers of a species (Goldin 2005: 38).\n\nFixating on the title \u201cHuman Nature Is Evil\u201d (which may or\nmay not derive from Xunzi himself) can lead to an elision of the\nsecond half of the chapter\u2019s credo: \u201cwhat is good [in\npeople] is their artifice\u201d (qi shan zhe wei ye\n\u5176\u5584\u8005\u507d\u4e5f). \u201cArtifice\u201d\n (wei)[5]\n refers to all the traits and habits that we acquire through our own\nconscious actions. And if we achieve any goodness, it must be because\nof our artifice: whereas \n\n\nobeying one\u2019s xing and following one\u2019s emotions\nmust result in contention and robbery \u2026 the transformation\n[brought about by] the methods of a teacher and the Way of ritual and\nmorality will result in deference and courtesy, in accordance with\nrefinement and principles, and return to order. (Xunzi 23.1a)\n\n\n\nThus the phrase that is used to denote moral self-cultivation is not\nto overcome or abandon the xing, but to transform it\n(huaxing \u5316\u6027). For this reason, in addition to\nstylistic features that trouble some readers, the chapter is\noccasionally impugned as corrupt or inauthentic (Robins 2001\u201302;\nZhou Chicheng 2014).\n",
