    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || The Structure of a Semantic Theory\n3.1 The Structure of a Semantic Theory\n\nAlthough Davidson wrote on a wide range of topics, a great deal of his\nwork, particularly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, is focussed\non the problem of developing an approach to the theory of meaning that\nwould be adequate to natural language. The characteristic feature of\nDavidson\u2019s approach to this problem is his proposal that meaning\nis best understood via the concept of truth, and, more particularly,\nthat the basic structure for any adequate theory of meaning is that\ngiven in a formal theory of truth.\n\nDavidson\u2019s thinking about semantic theory develops on the basis\nof a holistic conception of linguistic understanding (see \u2018Truth\nand Meaning\u2019 [1967c]). Providing a theory of meaning for a\nlanguage is thus a matter of developing a theory that will enable us\nto generate, for every actual and potential sentence of the language\nin question, a theorem that specifies what each sentence means. On\nthis basis a theory of meaning for German that was given in English\nmight be expected to generate theorems that would explicate the German\nsentence \u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 as meaning that snow is white.\nSince the number of potential sentences in any natural language is\ninfinite, a theory of meaning for a language that is to be of use to\ncreatures with finite powers such as ourselves, must be a theory that\ncan generate an infinity of theorems (one for each sentence) on the\nbasis of a finite set of axioms. Indeed, any language that is to be\nlearnable by creatures such as ourselves must possess a structure that\nis amenable to such an approach. Consequently, the commitment to\nholism also entails a commitment to a compositional\napproach according to which the meanings of sentences are seen to\ndepend upon the meanings of their parts, that is, upon the meanings of\nthe words that form the finite base of the language and out of which\nsentences are composed. Compositionality does not compromise holism,\nsince not only does it follow from it, but, on the Davidsonian\napproach, it is only as they play a role in whole sentences that\nindividual words can be viewed as meaningful. It is sentences, and not\nwords, that are thus the primary focus for a Davidsonian theory of\nmeaning. Developing a theory for a language is a matter of developing\na systematic account of the finite structure of the language that\nenables the user of the theory to understand any and every sentence of\nthe language.\n\nA Davidsonian theory of meaning explicates the meanings of expressions\nholistically through the interconnection that obtains among\nexpressions within the structure of the language as a whole.\nConsequently, although it is indeed a theory of meaning, a\ntheory of the sort Davidson proposes will have no use for a concept of\nmeaning understood as some discrete entity (whether a determinate\nmental state or an abstract \u2018idea\u2019) to which meaningful\nexpressions refer. One important implication of this is that the\ntheorems that are generated by such a theory of meaning cannot be\nunderstood as theorems that relate expressions and\n\u2018meanings\u2019. Instead such theorems will relate sentences to\nother sentences. More particularly, they will relate sentences in the\nlanguage to which the theory applies (the\n\u2018object-language\u2019) to sentences in the language in which\nthe theory of meaning is itself couched (the\n\u2018meta-language\u2019) in such a way that the latter effectively\n\u2018give the meanings of\u2019 or translate the former. It might\nbe thought that the way to arrive at theorems of this sort is to take\nas the general form of such theorems \u2018s means that\np\u2019 where s names an object-language sentence\nand p is a sentence in the meta-language. But this would be\nalready to assume that we could give a formal account of the\nconnecting phrase \u2018means that\u2019, and not only does this\nseem unlikely, but it also appears to assume a concept of meaning when\nit is precisely that concept (at least as it applies within a\nparticular language) that the theory aims to elucidate. It is at this\npoint that Davidson turns to the concept of truth. Truth, he argues,\nis a less opaque concept than that of meaning. Moreover, to specify\nthe conditions under which a sentence is true is also a way of\nspecifying the meaning of a sentence. Thus, rather than\n\u2018s means that p\u2019, Davidson proposes, as\nthe model for theorems of an adequate theory of meaning,\n\u2018s is true if and only if p\u2019 (the use of\nthe biconditional \u2018if and only if\u2019 is crucial here as it\nensures the truth-functional equivalence of the sentences s\nand p, that is, it ensures they will have identical\ntruth-values). The theorems of a Davidsonian theory of meaning for\nGerman couched in English would thus take the form of sentences such\nas \u201c\u2018Schnee ist weiss\u2019 is true if and only if snow\nis white.\u201d\n",
