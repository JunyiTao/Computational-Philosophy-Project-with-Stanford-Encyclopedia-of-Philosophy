    "main_text": "\n\nIn philosophy, intentionality is the power of minds and mental states\nto be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and\nstates of affairs. To say of an individual\u2019s mental states that\nthey have intentionality is to say that they are mental\nrepresentations or that they have contents. Furthermore, to the extent\nthat a speaker utters words from some natural language or draws\npictures or symbols from a formal language for the purpose of\nconveying to others the contents of her mental states, these artifacts\nused by a speaker too have contents or intentionality.\n\u2018Intentionality\u2019 is a philosopher\u2019s word: ever since\nthe idea, if not the word itself, was introduced into philosophy by\nFranz Brentano in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, it has\nbeen used to refer to the puzzles of representation, all of which lie\nat the interface between the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of\nlanguage. A picture of a dog, a proper name (e.g.,\n\u2018Fido\u2019), the common noun \u2018dog\u2019 or the concept\nexpressed by the word can mean, represent, or stand for, one or\nseveral hairy barking creatures. A complete thought, a full sentence\nor a picture can stand for or describe a state of affairs. How could\nsome of the represented things (e.g., dinosaurs) be arbitrarily remote\nin space and time from the representation (e.g., a human thought or\nutterance about dinosaurs tokened in 2018), while others (e.g.,\nnumbers) may not even be in space and time at all? How could some\nrepresentations (e.g., direct quotations such as\n\u2018dinosaur\u2019) even stand for themselves? How does a complex\nrepresentation (e.g., a complete thought or a full sentence) inherit\nits meaning or content from the meanings or contents of its\nconstituents? How should one construe the relationship between the\niconic content of pictorial representations and the conceptual content\nof proposition-like representations (thoughts and utterances)? How\nshould one understand the relation between the content of an\nindividual\u2019s mental state and the meanings of external symbols\nused by the individual to express her internal mental states? Are\nrepresentations of the world part of the world they represent? Do all\nof an individual\u2019s mental states have intentionality or only\nsome of them? The entry falls into ten sections: \n",
