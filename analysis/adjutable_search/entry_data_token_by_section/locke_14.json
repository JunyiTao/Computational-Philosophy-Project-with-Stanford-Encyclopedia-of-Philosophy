    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || Human Nature and God\u2019s Purposes\n4.2 Human Nature and God\u2019s Purposes\n\nAccording to Locke, God created man and we are, in effect, God\u2019s\nproperty. The chief end set us by our creator as a species and as\nindividuals is survival. A wise and omnipotent God, having made people\nand sent them into this world:\n\n\n\u2026by his order and about his business, they are his property\nwhose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one\nanother\u2019s pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties,\nsharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any\nsubordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another,\nas if we were made for one another\u2019s uses, as the inferior ranks\nof creatures are for our\u2019s. (Treatises II,2,6)\n\n\nIt follows immediately that \u201che has no liberty to destroy\nhimself, or so much as any creature in his possession, yet when some\nnobler use than its bare possession calls for it\u201d\n(Treatises II.2.6). So, murder and suicide violate the divine\npurpose.\n\nIf one takes survival as the end, then we may ask what are the means\nnecessary to that end. On Locke\u2019s account, these turn out to be\nlife, liberty, health and property. Since the end is set by God, on\nLocke\u2019s view we have a right to the means to that end. So we\nhave rights to life, liberty, health and property. These are natural\nrights, that is they are rights that we have in a state of nature\nbefore the introduction of civil government, and all people have these\nrights equally.\n\nThere is also a law of nature. It is the Golden Rule, interpreted in\nterms of natural rights. Thus Locke writes:\n\n\nThe state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges\neveryone: and reason which is that law, teaches all mankind who will\nbut consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to\nharm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions\u2026.\n(Treatises II.2.6)\n\n\nLocke tells us that the law of nature is revealed by reason. Locke\nmakes the point about the law that it commands what is best for us. If\nit did not, he says, the law would vanish for it would not be obeyed.\nIt is in this sense that Locke means that reason reveals the law. If\nyou reflect on what is best for yourself and others, given the goal of\nsurvival and our natural equality, you will come to this conclusion.\n(See the section on\n the law of nature\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s Political Philosophy.)\n\nLocke does not intend his account of the state of nature as a sort of\nutopia. Rather it serves as an analytical device that explains why it\nbecomes necessary to introduce civil government and what the\nlegitimate function of civil government is. Thus, as Locke conceives\nit, there are problems with life in the state of nature. The law of\nnature, like civil laws can be violated. There are no police,\nprosecutors or judges in the state of nature as these are all\nrepresentatives of a government with full political power. The\nvictims, then, must enforce the law of nature in the state of nature.\nIn addition to our other rights in the state of nature, we have the\nrights to enforce the law and to judge on our own behalf. We may,\nLocke tells us, help one another. We may intervene in cases where our\nown interests are not directly under threat to help enforce the law of\nnature. This right eventually serves as the justification for\nlegitimate rebellion. Still, in the state of nature, the person who is\nmost likely to enforce the law under these circumstances is the person\nwho has been wronged. The basic principle of justice is that the\npunishment should be proportionate to the crime. But when the victims\nare judging the seriousness of the crime, they are more likely to\njudge it of greater severity than might an impartial judge. As a\nresult, there will be regular miscarriages of justice. This is perhaps\nthe most important problem with the state of nature.\n",
