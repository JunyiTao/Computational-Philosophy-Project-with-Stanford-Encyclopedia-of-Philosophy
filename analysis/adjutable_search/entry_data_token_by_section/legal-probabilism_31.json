    "main_text": "Further Objections || The problem of priors\n7.3 The problem of priors\n\nAnother objection often leveled against legal probabilism is the\nproblem of priors. This problem emerges as one sets out to assess the\nposterior probability of a hypothesis given the available evidence,\n\\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\).\n\nTo carry out the calculations, Bayes\u2019 theorem requires as a\nstarting point the prior probability of the hypothesis, \\(\\Pr(H)\\),\nirrespective of the evidence. The correct assessment of this prior\nprobability is by no means obvious. Different strategies have been\nproposed.\n\nFirst, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/k\\) where \\(k\\) is\nthe number of alternative equiprobable hypotheses. If there are \\(k\\)\npossible hypotheses and no one is more probable than the other, it is\nnatural to assign \\(1/k\\) to each hypothesis. This approach, however,\nwould render prior probabilities quite sensitive to the choice of\nhypotheses and thus potentially arbitrary. In addition, this approach\nis particularly unsuitable for criminal cases. If two hypotheses are\n\u201cthe defendant is guilty\u201d and \u201cthe defendant is\ninnocent\u201d, the prior probability of each would be 50%.\nDefendants in criminal cases, however, should be presumed innocent\nuntil proven guilty. Prior probability of guilt at the level of .5\nseems excessive. The presumption of innocence\u2014a procedural\nprotection afforded to all defendants in many countries\u2014should\nrequire that the prior probability of guilt be set to a small value\n(Allen et al. 1995). But it is unclear how low that value\nshould be. Would .001 be sufficiently low or should it be .000001? All\nthat can be said, perhaps, is that in criminal cases the prior\nprobability of guilt should be extremely low (Friedman 2000).\n\nAlternatively, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/n\\) where\n\\(n\\) is the number of total possible suspects or wrongdoers who could\nhave committed the crime or civil wrong under dispute at trial. This,\ntoo, is a plausible proposal. Since someone must have committed the\nwrong, absent any further evidence anyone could have committed it, so\n\\(1/n\\) is a reasonable starting point. But this proposal also quickly\nruns into difficulties. In some cases, whether a wrong was committed\nby anyone can itself be disputed. Or there might be cases in which an\nillegal act was certainly committed and the defendant took part in it,\nbut it is not clear what illegal act it was, say murder or\nmanslaughter.\n\nTo avoid some of the difficulties described above, other models\nrely on relevant background information, for example, geographical\ninformation about people\u2019s opportunities to commit crimes\n(Fenton et al. 2019). But even if these models are\nsuccessful in giving well-informed assessments of prior probabilities,\na deeper difficulty lingers. That is, any assessment of prior\nprobabilities, no matter how it is done, is likely to violate existing\nnormative requirements of the trial system (Dahlman 2017; Engel 2012;\nSchweizer 2013). If the assessment of prior probabilities relies on\ndemographic information, people who belong to certain demographic\ngroups will be regarded as having a higher prior probability of\ncommitting a wrong than others. But if some people\u2019s priors are\nhigher than other people\u2019s priors, it will be easier to convict\nor find liable those who are assigned higher priors, even if the\nevidence against them is the same as the evidence against those\nassigned lower priors. This outcome can be seen as unfair, especially\nin criminal cases, since it exposes to a higher risk of conviction\nthose innocents who are assigned a higher prior probability because of\nthe demographic group they belong to (Di Bello and O\u2019Neil\n2020).\n\nPerhaps, as some have suggested, legal probabilists should do away\nwith prior probabilities and rely on likelihood ratios instead as a\nguide for trial decisions (Sullivan 2019). Another strategy for\navoiding the problem of priors is to consider an interval of values\nand see the extent to which different possible priors affect the\nposterior probability (Finkelstein and Fairley 1970), as discussed\nin\n Section 1.4.\n",
