Expressing Mind and Intending Objects \u2014 Meinong\u2019s Theory of Meaning\n\nMeinong did not develop a comprehensive philosophy of language; his\nremarks on language are rather fragmentary and embedded as digressions\nin his object-theoretical works. In 1910, \u00a74: 28 [27],\nhe summarizes his views this way: \u201ca word means something so far\nas it expresses a presenting experience, and the object thereby\npresented is the meaning [Bedeutung].\u201d This statement\ncan be generalized to all linguistic items: If someone judges\n\u201cThe golden mountain does not exist\u201d she expresses a\njudgement and its presupposed representations, and she means the\nobjective that the golden mountain does not exist, and all the other\npresupposed objecta such as something golden and a mountain.\n\nIn the above quotation \u201cmeans\u201d and \u201cmeaning\u201d\nhave two uses: (1) Meaning as a relation between signs and experiences\n(acts), i.e., the relation of expressing experiences by means of\nsigns; and (2) meaning as a relation between signs and the objects\nthat are presented by the expressed experiences (more exactly: by the\ncorresponding psychological contents), that is, the relation of\nexpressing the objects of experiences. Referring to Martinak 1901,\nMeinong states that signs are objects which let someone know the\nexistence of (usually other) objects. A is a sign for someone\nif it constitutes the epistemic ground to an epistemic consequent\nB: If you can infer the presence of B from the\npresence of A, then A is a sign of B for\nyou, and the being of B is the meaning of the sign\nA. Sign and meaning in this sense cover a broad range of\ncases, including natural, \u201creal\u201d signs like dark clouds\nfor thunderstorm or tears for sorrow, and artificial,\n\u201cfinal\u201d signs as, for example, (groups of) words express\nmental acts. An experience (like happiness, sorrow, conviction) can be\nexpressed by an object (a smiling face, tears, and a group of words\nrespectively). This object (more exactly: the fact that there is such\nan object) lets you know the expressed act (experience, mental\nphenomenon) and, therefore, functions as a sign which has the act\nbehind it as its meaning1. If A is the sign that\nhas the experience B as its meaning1, and if the\nobject C is presented by the expressed experience B,\nthen the sign A is connected not only with B but, in\na new way, also with C, which is the meaning2. The\nutterance \u201cIt is raining in Graz\u201d means1 a\njudgement, and it means2 the object of the judgement, i.e.,\nthe objective that it is raining in Graz. In other words, you can say\nthe utterance expresses the judgement in one way, and it expresses the\nobject presented by the judgement in another way. Meinong observes\nthat the meaning of a word is usually an actual meaning for someone,\nbut he also mentions in contrast to such a speaker\u2019s meaning the\npotential, linguistic meaning of a word.\n\nMeinong\u2019s account from 1910 is represented in the schematic\ndiagram below (cf. Simons 1992, 163):\n\n\n\n\nWhen someone utters in a sentence \u201csomething that is\nblack\u201d and \u201csomething that is light\u201d, respectively,\ntwo different sorts of things can be meant by those expressions: (1)\nthe meant object is closed to further possible determination;\n(2) the meant object is open to further possible\ndetermination. If \u201csomething that is black\u201d is used in the\nopen way, we think of the object as something that can have other\nproperties besides blackness; it may be identical with the object that\nis meant by \u201csomething that is light\u201d. If we use the\nexpressions \u201csomething that is black\u201d and \u201csomething\nthat is light\u201d in the closed way, the objects meant by these\nexpressions are necessarily distinct. In general, we speak about real,\nexistent things, which as completely determined objects have\ninfinitely many determinations. As our mind can only grasp a finite\nnumber of aspects, we usually intend the objects as open (1910,\n\u00a745). Nevertheless a question remains: That an object appears\nclosed or open to us, is due to our intending (meaning). But what\nmakes an open attitude open?\n\nLater, in 1915, Meinong points out that we can use incomplete objects\n(see above 5.2, and 5.4.3), like a square brown thing, as a\nkind of \u201cauxiliary object\u201d [Hilfsgegenstand] to\nintend (mean) more completely determined objects, like a square\nbrown thing in the dining room, or even complete ones as the\n\u201ctarget objects\u201d [Zielgegenst\u00e4nde] of our\nintending. In order to apprehend a target object, the auxiliary object\nhas to have an \u201cimplexive being\u201d [implexives\nSein] in the target object, that is, it has to be in a way\ninvolved \u2014 Meinong says \u201cimplected\u201d \u2014 in the\nmore complete object. An incomplete object A is\nimplected in a more complete object T if and only if\nT has all the determinations A has (cf. 1915,\n\u00a7\u00a727, 29; Section 5.2.3 above). In order to aim at a\ncomplete object, it is essential \u201cto include the moment of\ncompleteness explicitly in the intending. If I want to intend\nsomething wholly determined by the thought \u2018a square brown\nthing\u2019, without necessarily knowing the determinations which\ndistinguish it from something else, I need only think of \u2018a\ndeterminate square brown thing\u2019\u201d (1915, \u00a726: 189).\nMeinong points out that the determinacy or completeness he hints at\ncannot be simply seen as a nuclear property \u2014 it has to be of an\nextra-nuclear character. (See Section 5.4.3 above.)\n\nAs auxiliary objects are incomplete and as they can be implected in\ncomplete target objects, they bear a remarkable resemblance to things\nof abstract nature like universals, concepts or types. Indeed, in the\nappendix to his 1915 (p. 739\u201340) Meinong himself interprets such\nincomplete objects as platonic universals without being (see also\n1978: 368; Section 4.1 above), and he also states there: \u201cwhat\nwords mean [bedeuten] is the auxiliary object, and what they\ndesignate [nennen] is the target object\u201d (1915: 741).\nThis sounds like Frege\u2019s sense/reference distinction: The\nincomplete, auxiliary objects\u2019 role is akin to the role of\nFrege\u2019s sense, which functions as the mode of presentation and\nthe determinant of its referent. Meinong\u2019s view of incomplete\nobjects as auxiliary objects has also a close affinity with the\ndenoting concepts view of Russell (1903).\n",
