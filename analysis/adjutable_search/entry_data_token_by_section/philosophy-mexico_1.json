    "main_text": "Pre-Hispanic Philosophy\n2. Pre-Hispanic Philosophy\n\nDuring the early years following the Conquest, Spaniards quickly\nrealized that pre-Conquest Mexicans possessed a complex and\nsophisticated system of beliefs about human beings and the universe.\nIn his Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva\nEspa\u00f1a (1585 [1950\u20131982]), the Franciscan missionary\nBernardino de Sahag\u00fan (1499\u20131590) reproduced the ancient\nMexican worldview through documents and testimonials. Centuries later,\nwith the discovery of new documents and a deeper knowledge of\nindigenous languages, we have improved our understanding of how the\noriginal inhabitants of Mesoamerica viewed the world.\n\nThe first historians of Mexican philosophy recognized the richness and\nsophistication of native cosmology, but they did not consider it\nphilosophy per se. However, in 1955, Miguel\nLe\u00f3n-Portilla (1926\u20132019) challenged the received view\nand renewed our interest in Mesoamerican thought by publishing his\ninfluential La filosof\u00eda n\u00e1huatl\u2014emphasis\non filosof\u00eda\u2014a collection of recovered texts\ntranslated into Spanish that deal with cosmology, metaphysics,\nanthropology, ethics, and aesthetics. In his book,\nLe\u00f3n-Portilla argues that the Mexica (i.e., how the Aztecs\nreferred to themselves) in fact did philosophy, and he does so by\nreconstructing their philosophical tradition and comparing it to\nAncient Greek philosophy. Years later, other authors followed his\nexample and wrote extensive commentaries on Mayan texts such as\nPopol Vuh, which provide a deeper understanding of classical\nMayan cosmology and anthropology.\n\nThe use of the term \u201cphilosophy\u201d to speak of Mesoamerican\nthought has been applauded by those who believe that it is necessary\nto de-center the Western concept of philosophy. But it has been\ncriticized by those who believe that calling pre-Hispanic thought\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d fails to appreciate what distinguishes\nWestern philosophy as an achievement from a worldview or body of\nbeliefs, which of course all peoples possess. Thus, some scholars have\nclaimed that to interpret pre-Conquest texts as philosophy is to\nretroactively attribute to them something that wasn\u2019t there,\nspecifically a certain level of self-consciousness, rational\nreflection, and critique. Others have even questioned the authenticity\nof historical sources.\n\nFor instance, Quetzalc\u00f3atl, a deity of Mesoamerican culture who\nwas also the putative leader of the pre-Aztec Toltec people,\nchallenges traditional religious mythology and offers an original\nconception of divinity, the universe, and human nature. According to\nQuetzalc\u00f3atl, the supreme god is Omet\u00e9otl, the god of\nduality. Omet\u00e9otl was masculine and feminine, the creator of\nall things, and played an active role in all aspects of reality.\nHowever, since it is not clear whether Quetzalc\u00f3atl was a\nhistorical or mythical figure, it is also not clear what to make of\nthe ideas that we normally attribute to him and which have been\nfundamental in the development of our understanding of N\u00e1huatl\nphilosophy.\n\nAmong the tlamatinime\u2014wise men who followed the\nintellectual tradition of Quetzalc\u00f3atl\u2014Tezcoco\u2019s\nKing Nezahualc\u00f3yotl (1402\u20131472) was the most prominent.\nTezcoco was a small kingdom and a military ally of the Aztecs. King\nNezahualc\u00f3yotl developed a line of thought that has been\npreserved in his poetry and narrative prose, according to which he\ndoubted the permanence of human life in a world defined by change and\ndeath. If gold and jade can splinter, he mused, then human beings must\naccept that their passage on earth is transitory. However, our\nfinitude should not overwhelm us with sadness; instead, the human\nheart can find meaning in flor y canto (songs and flowers),\nwhich is how Nezahualc\u00f3yotl referred to art and beauty. Poetry\nand song persevere even as flowers wither and die, and it is our job\nto learn how to be patient and humble in the face of all that is\nbeyond our ken, such as the gods\u2019 plans, which will forever\nremain a mystery. Though his texts are fragmentary and poetic, we\nmight consider Nezahualc\u00f3yotl a philosopher because he\nquestions mythological and religious responses to traditional\nphilosophical problems, such as essence, change, and the meaning of\nlife. In fact, we might we might compare his thought and style to that\nof Heraclitus or Parmenides.\n\nThe connection between pre-Hispanic thought and Mexican philosophy has\ndeepened in recent years. One example of this is the concept of\nnepantla, which Emilio Uranga (1921\u20131988) reintroduces\nin his book An\u00e1lisis del ser del mexicano (1952).\nAccording to Uranga, nepantla refers to an ontological\ncondition of existence that captures both the specific nature of\nMexican being and the human condition more generally. Nepantla means\nto be in between two opposites without fully rejecting or adopting\neither. Several authors from both Mexico and the United States have\nsince employed the concept of nepantla in novel ways to\ndescribe various aspects of our existence (e.g., Gloria\nAnzald\u00faa).\n\nOther authors have recovered categories coined by the survivors of\nindigenous peoples and have proposed alternatives to Western\nphilosophy. For example, Carlos Lenkesdorf\u2019s (1926\u20132010)\nUna filosof\u00eda en clave tojolabal (2002) offers a\nphilosophical reconstruction of beliefs and practices of the Tojolabal\nnatives who live in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Lenkesdorf studies\nthe language and everyday practices of the Tojolabal people to propose\nan entirely different way of understanding the relationship between\npersons, community, and nature. We can also find key concepts of\nindigenous Mexicans in the political thought of the members of the\nZapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN).\n\nOne recent effort to reconstruct pre-Hispanic thought is James\nMaffie\u2019s Aztec Philosophy (2015). Using a broad\nselection of sources, old and new, Maffie offers a reconstruction of\nAztec metaphysics that employs categories and concepts of Western\nmetaphysics to demonstrate the originality of Nahuatl thinking.\n",
