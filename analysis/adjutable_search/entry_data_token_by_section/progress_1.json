    "main_text": "Pre-Enlightenment Thought\n2. Pre-Enlightenment Thought \n\nWhether any ancient philosophers proposed a doctrine of progress is a\nmatter of scholarly contention (Bury 1932, 11; Nesbit 1994, xi).\nHowever, it is clear that the figures of antiquity who exerted the\nmost influence on later thinkers did not believe in progress in the\nrobust sense used in this article.\n\n\nPlato and Aristotle hold a cyclical view of human affairs.  They allow\nthat certain developments occur spontaneously, but also see disaster\nand decline as inevitable.  In the Laws, Plato proposes that\nhuman society begins with the family, then moves through intermediate\nforms, and finally arrives at the city-state (680a-682d).  In\nthe Politics, Aristotle also presents this progression of\nforms (1252a24\u20131253a4).  Not only is man a political animal as a\nmatter of fact (Politics, 1253a2), it is also true that human\nexcellence is only possible within a city-state with a good\nconstitution.  But unhappily there is no tendency for the city-state,\nonce achieved, to realize or maintain such a constitution.  For\ninstance, while Aristotle cautiously admits that laws can and should\nimprove (1269a12\u201314), Book V of the Politics shows that all\nconstitutional forms\u2014bad and good\u2014are unstable.\n\n\nLarge-scale natural events also play an important role in Plato and\nAristotle's presentation of human affairs.  In\nthe Statesman, Plato adopts the traditional Greek story of a\ngolden age and a subsequent decline, written down by Hesiod\nin Works and Days.  Hesiod tells the story of five races of\nmen: the golden race (Lines 109\u2013120), the silver race (121\u2013139), the\nbronze race (140\u2013155), the demi-gods (156\u2013169b), and the iron race\n(170\u2013201).  The golden race is the best of all, and the present race,\nthe iron race, is the worst.  According to Plato's story, the\nages described by Hesiod correspond to parts of a cycle during which\nthe earth rotates first in one direction and then in another.  While the \nearth moves in the first direction, the gods oversee the affairs of mankind.  \nAs a herdsman looks after his flock, the gods tend to the needs of human beings.  \nBecause they are under the perfect care of the gods, humans do not need to\ngovern themselves (Statesman, 271e-272a).  Plato suggests that the\ngolden age, the era of the golden race, occurred during such a period.\nWhen the earth changes course, a period of chaos ensues, which\ncorresponds to the end of the golden age.  Finally, when the earth\nmoves in the second direction, people are left on their own, which\nexplains the other ages described by Hesiod.  In the Laws,\nPlato does not return to this elaborate myth, but endorses the view\nthat \u201cthe human race has been repeatedly annihilated by floods\nand plagues and many other causes, so that only a fraction of it\nsurvived\u201d (Laws, 677a). Aristotle also entertains the\npossibility of periodic flooding (Meteorology, 352a29\u201332) and\nsuggests that myths may contain the remnants of the wisdom of\ndestroyed civilizations (Metaphysics, 1074b9\u201313).\n\n\nAfter Plato and Aristotle, the most influential early philosopher is\nSt. Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430 C.E.).  In  The City of God\nagainst the Pagans, Augustine presents a radically new, Christian\nvision of human history.  Some humans, God's elect, are\npredestined for heaven.  The rest of humanity is predestined for\ndamnation.  Those who are saved belong to the \u201cCity of\nGod\u201d and those who are damned belong to the \u201cCity of\nman\u201d (426, XV.1).  Augustine rejects cyclical accounts of human\naffairs for a linear one.  He is especially concerned to repudiate the\ndoctrine of eternal recurrence, which says that events identical in\nall respects repeat over and over again.  He emphasizes that the\nbirth, death, and resurrection of Christ are unique occurrences (426,\nXII.14) and compares the history of the elect to an individual life\n(426, X.14).\n\n\nInsofar as it is linear, Augustine's narrative of salvation\nresembles doctrines of progress.  But his emphasis on the City of God\ncontrasts with the worldly, inclusive vision of theorists of progress.\nAs we will see, these theorists are concerned with humanity as a\nwhole, rather than with a part of it.  And their focus is on earth\nrather than on heaven.\n\n",
