One important addition includes the Vorbericht,\nwhere Jacobi contends that his original idea has merely become\nclearer, not changed. It is apparent that his evolution as a thinker\nhas not included a change in perspective, only clarifications in its\ndelivery. Jacobi stresses how his notion of truth and the very\nfoundation of his theory of knowledge yield a philosophical\nperspective that could save life. His antagonists, in contrast, seem\noccupied with a form of thinking that would destroy it (JWA 1, 1:\n339). He presents the theoretical tools for making of the practical\nagent the unmovable foundation for all existence and all life, while\nalso revealing a way to connect to a living personal God: the same\nnotion of Vernunft, following a certain degree of evolution\nbetween the first and the second edition of the \u2018Spinoza\nBriefen\u2019, eventually becomes the \u2018Sinn f\u00fcr das\nUebersinnliche\u2019, matching the way in which the senses perceive\nnatural phenomena (JWA 1, 1: 341 and JWA 1,1: 158). It can even be\nclaimed that in the \u2018Vorbericht\u2019, the religious\nunderpinning of Jacobi\u2019s arguments becomes more explicit.\nHowever, Jacobi never surpasses the limits that he placed on\nrationality itself: his thought never aspires to become a theological\nor philosophical system. He rejects both forms of systematic knowledge\ndue to the anti\u2013systematic character of the ground of reality\n(JWA 1, 1: 347). Still, this approach does not translate into an\nattraction to irrationalism. Rather, it implies a different conception\nof rationality altogether.\n",
