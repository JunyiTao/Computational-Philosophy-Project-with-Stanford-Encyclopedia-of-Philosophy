We should suspect an\n\u201cidealization\u201d in these reports in which an ideal goal is\npresented as achieved when in fact it wasn\u2019t. Mystics\nthereby remember an experience with content as pure\nconsciousness only because of a \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d of what\nwas expected. (2) Reports of \u201cemptying out\u201d and\n\u201cforgetting\u201d may refer only to an emptying of ordinary\nexperiential content, thereby making room for an extraordinary\ncontent. This accords well with the conception of ayin\n(nothingness) in Jewish mysticism, which is positively saturated with\ndivine reality (Matt 1997). For a theist such as Eckhart,\nemptying the mind by \u201cunknowing\u201d is to empty the mind of all\ncontent other than the being that we share with God (Eckhart\n2009, 34\u201336, 42\u201343), not an absolute emptiness of content.\n(3) Even if a subject honestly reports on a pure consciousness\nepisode, there may have been conceptual events the subject either\nrepressed or experienced in a nebulous way (Wainwright 1981,\n117\u2013119). The latter simply do not remain for memory. (4)\nSome argue that because of the way our brain has evolved for our\nsurvival, all experience or awareness is necessarily\nintentional. Consciousness is always consciousness\nof something to a subject and hence necessarily contains some\ndualistic content. Thus, because of our nature, there can be no\nexperiences free of any content (Katz 1978). Defenders of the\npossibility of PCEs reply that it is the interpretation of\nthe experience\u2019s content a mystic gives after the experience\nthat reflects cultural ideas, but the experience\nitself is only a pure consciousness.\n\nBut even if PCEs occur, PCE defenders may be exaggerating the\ncentrality in mysticism of complete emptying out. The goal of\nclassical mysticisms is to align oneself with reality (as defined by\none\u2019s tradition) \u2014 e.g., attaining the selflessness of nirvana\nor aligning one\u2019s will with God\u2019s. It is questionable if a PCE is\ncentral in mainstream theistic mysticisms where a mystic forgets\nall else usually only to better contemplate God. Typical is the\nChristian mystic Jan Ruysbroeck who wrote that emptying oneself is but\na prelude to the mystical life of contemplating God through an act of\ndivine grace (Zaehner 1957, 170\u2013171). Likewise, the\n\u201cshedding of corporeality\u201d in early Hasidism was meant to\nenable the mystic to contemplate the unified supernal structure of the\ndivine sefirot. And the Zen master Dogen\n(1200\u20131253) wrote about \u201cwrongly thinking that the nature\nof things will appear when the whole world we perceive is\nobliterated\u201d (Dogen 1986, 39).\n",
