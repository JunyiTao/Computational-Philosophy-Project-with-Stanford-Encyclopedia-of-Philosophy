    "main_text": "Influence || Models\n3.2 Models\n\nRelations of influence between variables are often encoded in formal\nmodels. Just as the causal relations between tokens and types can be\neither deterministic or probabilistic, so too can the relations of\ninfluence between variables be either deterministic or probabilistic.\nDeterministic relations between variables are represented with\nstructural equations models; whereas indeterministic relations between\nvariables can be represented with probabilistic models (sometimes with\nstructural equations models with random errors\u2014see the entry on\n causal models\u2014or\n often with just a causal graph paired with a probability distribution\nover the values of the variables appearing in that graph\u2014see the\nentry on\n probabilistic causation.)\n\nIn the deterministic case, the relations of influence between\nvariables can be encoded in a system of structural equations. For\nillustration, consider again the neuron system we used in\n \u00a71.2.1\n above to illustrate early preemption. As we saw in\n \u00a71.2.3,\n for each neuron in the system, we can introduce a variable for\nwhether that neuron fires at the relevant time. Once we\u2019ve done\nso, the following system of structural equations describes the causal\nrelations between these variables. \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nA & \\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C \\\\\n D & \\coloneqq C \\\\\n E & \\coloneqq A \\vee D \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nBefore getting to the metaphysical questions about what kinds of\nrelations these equations represent, and what it takes for a system of\nequations like this to be correct, let us first focus on how these\nequations are used in practice. It\u2019s important to\nrecognize that there is meant to be a difference between\nstructural equations and ordinary equations. The equation \\(D\n= C\\) is symmetric. It could be re-written, equivalently, as \\(C=D\\).\nIn contrast, the structural equation \\(D \\coloneqq C\\) is\nnonsymmetric. It tells us that the variable \\(D\\) is causally\ninfluenced by the variable \\(C\\). And this form of causal influence is\nnot symmetric. To emphasize that these equations are not symmetric,\n\u201c\\(\\coloneqq\\)\u201d is used, rather than\n\u201c\\(=\\)\u201d.\n\nSome terminology: given a system of structural equations, the\nvariables which appear on the left-hand-side of some equation are\ncalled the endogenous variables. The variables which only\never appear on the right-hand-side of the equations are called\nexogenous. The model does not tell us anything about how the\nvalues of the exogenous variables are determined; but it does tell us\nsomething about how the values of the endogenous variables are\ncausally determined by the values of the other variables in the\nmodel.\n\nIn this case, an assignment of values to the exogenous variables is\nenough to tell us the value of every endogenous variable in the model.\nThat is: if you know that \\(B=C=1\\), you also know that \\(A=0\\) and\n\\(D=E=1\\). That needn\u2019t be the case in general. For instance,\nconsider the following system of equations: \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY &\\coloneqq X + Z \\\\\n X &\\coloneqq Y - Z \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nIn this system of structural equations, even after you know that the\nexogenous variable \\(Z = 10\\), you are not able to solve for the\nvalues of the two endogenous variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The reason\nfor this is that, in this system of equations, there is a\ncycle of influence: \\(X\\) influences \\(Y\\), and \\(Y\\)\ninfluences \\(X\\). When there are cycles of influence like this, even a\ndeterministic system of equations, together with an assignment of\nvalues to the exogenous variables, will not determine the values of\nall of the endogenous variables. (See the entry on\n backwards causation\n and the section on causal loops in the entry on\n time travel.)\n However, if we rule out cycles of influence like this, then an\nassignment of values to the exogenous variables will determine the\nvalues of all of the variables in the model. Likewise, any probability\ndistribution over the exogenous variables will induce a probability\ndistribution over the endogenous variables, as well.\n\nIt is often assumed that each of the structural equations in the\nsystem is independently disruptable. For instance: there is, at least\nin principle, some way of disrupting \\(C\\)\u2019s causal influence on\n\\(D\\)\u2014some way of making it so that the structural equation \\(D\n\\coloneqq C\\) no longer holds\u2014which leaves it so that both of\nthe structural equations \\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) and\n\\(E\\coloneqq A \\vee D\\) continue to hold. Not every way of disrupting\nthe causal relation between the variables \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) will be like\nthis. For instance, suppose that we remove all of the connections\nemanating out of the neuron c. This will disrupt the\ncausal connection between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), but it will also disrupt\nthe causal connection between \\(C\\) and \\(A\\); it will make it so that\nthe structural equation \\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) no longer\nholds. (This equation tells us that, if \\(C=1\\), then \\(A=0\\); but,\nwith the connection between c and a severed, this is\nno longer true.) This property of a system of structural\nequations\u2014that each of the equations may be disrupted without\naffecting any of the other equations in the model\u2014is known as\nmodularity. (For criticism of this requirement, see\nCartwright 2002; for a defense, see Hausman & Woodward 1999, 2004.\nFor more on modularity, see Woodward 2003.)\n\nIf the system of equations is modular, then it is at least in\nprinciple possible to disrupt one of the equations without affecting\nany of the others. Suppose that happens, and we disrupt the equation\n\\(A\\coloneqq B \\wedge \\neg C\\) without affecting any of the other\nequations, for instance. Suppose further that we do this in such a way\nas to determine the value of \\(A\\), or to determine a probability\ndistribution over the values of \\(A\\). Then, we have performed an\nintervention on the variable \\(A\\). Note that this notion of an\nintervention is relative to a system of equations. Whether some way of\ndisrupting an equation and directly setting the value of the variable\non its left-hand-side counts as an intervention or not will vary from\ncausal model to causal model. In general, an intervention on\nan endogenous variable, \\(V\\) (relative to some model) is some way of\nmaking it so that \\(V\\)\u2019s structural equation (the equation with\n\\(V\\) on the left-hand-side) no longer holds, even though every other\nstructural equation in the model continues to hold, and directly\nsetting the value of \\(V\\), or directly determining a probability\ndistribution over the values of \\(V\\).\n\nGiven a deterministic causal model\u2014a system of structural\nequations\u2014the way to formally represent an intervention on an\nendogenous variable, \\(V\\), is straightforward: you remove the\nstructural equation which has that variable on its left-hand-side, and\nleave all the other equations unchanged. You go on to treat \\(V\\) as\nif it were an exogenous variable, with the value or the probability\ndistribution it was given through the intervention. Assuming the\nsystem of equations is acyclic, you can then work out the value of the\nother variables in the model, or the probability distribution over the\nvalues of the other variables in the model, as before.\n\nInterventions like these have been used by many to provide a semantics\nfor what will here be called causal counterfactual\nconditionals. As the term is used here, what makes a counterfactual\ncausal is that it holds fixed factors which are causally\nindependent of its antecedent. It doesn\u2019t say anything about\nwhat would have to have been different in order for the\nantecedent to obtain. That is: it says nothing about the necessary\ncausal precursors of the antecedent. It holds fixed all factors which\nare not causally downstream of the antecedent, and only allows to\nswing free factors which are causally downstream of the antecedent.\nWithin a system of structural equations, this is accomplished by\nmodeling an intervention to bring about the truth of the\nantecedent. (For more on this \u201cinterventionist\u201d treatment\nof counterfactuals, see Galles & Pearl 1998; Briggs 2012; Huber\n2013, and the entry on\n counterfactuals.)\n",
