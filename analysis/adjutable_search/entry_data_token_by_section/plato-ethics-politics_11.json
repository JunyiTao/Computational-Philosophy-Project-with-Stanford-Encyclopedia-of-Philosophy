    "main_text": "Politics, Part One: The Ideal Constitution || Feminism\n4.3 Feminism\n\n\nSocrates ties the abolition of private families among the guardian \nclasses to another radical proposal, that in the ideal city the \neducation for and job of ruling should be open to girls and women. \nThe exact relation between the proposals is contestable (Okin 1977). Is Socrates \nproposing the abolition of families in order to free up women to do \nthe work of ruling? Or is Socrates putting the women to work since \nthey will not have the job of family-caregiver anymore? But perhaps \nneither is prior to the other. Each of the proposals can be supported\nindependently, and their dovetailing effects can be claimed as a \nhappy convergence.\n\n\nMany readers have seen in Plato\u2019s Republic a rare exception \nin western philosophy\u2019s long history of sexist denigration of women, \nand some have even decided that Plato\u2019s willingness to open up the \nbest education and the highest jobs to women shows a kind of \nfeminism (Wender 1973). Other readers disagree (Annas 1976, Buchan 1999). They point to Plato\u2019s indifference \nto the needs of actual women in his own city, to Socrates\u2019 frequent, \ndisparaging remarks about women and \u201cwomanish\u201d attitudes, and to the \nilliberal reasons Socrates offers for educating and empowering women.\n\n\nThe broad claim that Plato or the Republic is feminist \ncannot be sustained, and the label \u2018feminist\u2019 is an \nespecially contested one, but still, there are two features of the \nRepublic\u2019s ideal city that can be reasonably called \nfeminist. First, Socrates suggests that the distinction between male \nand female is as relevant as the distinction between having long hair\nand having short hair for the purposes of deciding who should be \nactive guardians: men and women, just like the long-haired and the \nshort-haired, are by nature the same for the assignment of education \nand jobs (454b\u2013456b). This suggestion seems to express the plausibly \nfeminist point that one\u2019s sex is generally irrelevant to one\u2019s \nqualifications for education or employment.\n\n\nThe second plausibly feminist commitment in the Republic \ninvolves the abolition of private families. The feminist import of \nthis may be obscured by the way in which Socrates and his \ninterlocutors talk of \u201cwomen and children shared in common.\u201d In fact,\nSocrates\u2019 companions might well have been forgiven if this way of \ntalking had called to mind pictures of orgiastic free love in the \nguardians\u2019 camp, for that, after all, is how Aristophanes\u2019 \nEcclesiazusae plays the proposal of \u201csharing women and \nchildren\u201d for laughs. But as Socrates clarifies what he means, both \nfree love and male possessiveness turn out to be beside the point. \n(The talk of \u201csharing women and children\u201d reflects the male \nperspective of the men having the conversation but not the content of\nthe proposal.) Then Socrates\u2019 proposal can seem especially striking. \nPlato is clearly aware that an account of how the polis should be \narranged must give special attention to how families are arranged. \nRelatedly, he is clearly aware that an account of the ideal citizens \nmust explain how sexual desire, a paradigmatic appetitive attitude, \nshould fit into the good human life. Only very recently, with \nfeminist interventions, have sexual desire and its consequences come \nto seem crucial to political theory, and we might think that Plato\u2019s \nawareness of these as topics of political philosophy shows at least \nproto-feminist concern. All the more might this awareness seem \nfeminist when we relate it back to the first plausibly feminist \ncommitment, for Plato wants the economy of desire and reproduction to\nbe organized in such a way that women are free for education and \nemployment alongside men, in the guardian classes, at any rate.\n\n\nThree of the objections to calling the Republic feminist say\nmore about the contest over the label \u2018feminist\u2019 than \nthey do about Plato. First, some have said that feminism requires a \nconcern for women\u2019s rights and have then argued that Plato is not a \nfeminist on the grounds that he shows no interests in women\u2019s \nrights. This particular argument is not quite to the point, for it \nsays nothing about Plato\u2019s view of women per se. He is not \ninterested in women\u2019s rights just to the extent that he is not \ninterested in anyone\u2019s rights. Second, some have said that feminism \nrequires attention to what actual women want. Since Plato shows no \ninterest in what actual women want, he would seem on this view of \nfeminism to be anti-feminist. But the limitations of this criticism \nare apparent as soon as we realize that Plato shows no interest in \nwhat actual men want. Plato focuses instead on what women (and men) \nshould want, what they would want if they were in the best \npossible psychological condition. Actual women (and actual men), as \nwe might put Plato\u2019s point, are subject to false consciousness. \nThird, some have insisted that feminism requires attention to and \nconcern for the particular interests and needs of women as distinct \nfrom the particular interests and needs of men. Since Plato does not \nadmit of particular women\u2019s interests and needs, he would not, in \nthis view, be a feminist (except insofar as he accidentally promoted \nany supposed particular interests by, say, proposing the abolition of\nthe private family). Again, however, this objection turns on what we \nunderstand by \u2018feminism\u2019 more than on what Socrates is \nsaying in the Republic. There should be no doubt that there \nare conceptions of feminism according to which the Republic \nis anti-feminist. But this does not undercut the point that the \nRepublic advances a couple of plausibly feminist concerns.\n\n\nBetter ground for doubting Plato\u2019s apparent feminist commitments lies\nin the reasons that Socrates gives for them: Socrates consistently \nemphasizes concern for the welfare of the whole city, but not for\nwomen themselves (esp. 456c ff.). But Socrates\u2019 emphasis in Book Five\non the happiness of the city as a whole rather than the happiness of \nthe rulers (and cf. 465e\u2013466c) might have more to do with his worries\nabout convincing his interlocutors that ideal rulers do not flourish \nby exploiting the ruled. Thus, his emphasis need not be taken to \nrepresent a lack of concern for the women\u2019s interests. After all,\nwhat greater concern could Socrates show for the women than to insist\nthat they be fully educated and allowed to hold the highest offices? \nSocrates goes on to argue that the philosopher-rulers of the city, \nincluding the female philosopher-rulers, are as happy as human beings can be.\n\n\nThe best reason for doubting Plato\u2019s feminism is provided by those \ndisparaging remarks about women. We might try to distinguish between \nPlato\u2019s rather harsh view of the women around him and his more \noptimistic view of women as they would be in more favorable \ncircumstances (Vlastos 1989). It is also possible to distinguish between the \ntraditional sexist tropes as they feature in Plato\u2019s drama and the \nrejection of sexism in Plato\u2019s ideas. But it is not clear that these \ndistinctions will remove all of the tension, especially when Socrates\nand Glaucon are saying that men are stronger or better than women in \njust about every endeavor (455c).\n\n\nFinal judgment on this question is difficult (see also Saxonhouse 1976, Levin 1996, E. Brown 2002). The disparaging remarks\nhave to be taken one-by-one, as it is doubtful that all can be \nunderstood in exactly the same way. Moreover, it is of the utmost \nimportance to determine whether each remark says something about the \nway all women are by nature or essentially. If Plato thinks that \nwomen are essentially worse than men, then Socrates\u2019 claim that men \nand women have the same nature for education and employment is \npuzzling. But if the disparagements do not express any considered \nviews about the nature of women, then we might be able to conclude \nthat Plato is deeply prejudiced against women and yet committed to \nsome plausibly feminist principles.\n",
