The problem is that this spiritual equality does not\nautomatically translate into political equality for women in a more\ngeneral sense. Smith (1982) notes that Fell\u2019s defence of\nwomen\u2019s speaking did not \u201cinclude a questioning of other\naspects of sexual hierarchy\u201d (96). In response to 1 Timothy\n2:11\u201312 (\u201cI suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority\nover the man\u201d), Fell writes that\n\n\nHere the Apostle speaks particularly to a Woman in Relation to her\nHusband, to be in subjection to him, and not to teach, nor usurp\nauthority over him, and therefore he mentions Adam and\nEve: But let it be strained to the utmost, as the opposers of\nWomens Speaking would have it, that is, That they should not preach nor\nspeak in the Church, of which there is nothing here. (Fell 1667, 9)\n\n\n\nHere Fell implicitly accepts the husband\u2019s authority over the\nwife\u2019s within marriage. Her stand on women\u2019s preaching is\nnot meant to challenge hierarchical relations within the marital\ninstitution, it challenges only women\u2019s subordinate position in\nthe church. Smith sees this as a pattern in sectarian women\u2019s\ntexts of the seventeenth-century:\n\n\n\nMost female religious writers simply ignored political or feminist\ntopics. Even Margaret Fell Fox, one of the most forceful supporters of\nwomen\u2019s being able to speak in Quaker meetings, argued in\nWomen\u2019s Speaking Justified \u2026 that they should\nnever speak in a way that would usurp authority over men. For the large\nmajority of women writing religious tracts during the seventeenth\ncentury, the question of women\u2019s rights simply never arose.\n(Smith 1982, 70)\n\n\n\nAlong the same lines, Broad and Green (2009, 172\u201379) point out that\nthere is no necessary inference from the Quaker theory of spiritual\nequality to the view that women as well as men ought to have equal\naccess to social goods, such as education. The Quakers\u2019 arguments\ndo not logically lead to equal education for women, because women do\nnot require an education in order to attain salvation or to be in the\nspirit of the Lord. Their arguments do not logically lead to equal\nemployment opportunities or full political participation for women\neither, because it is only necessary that women be active and employed\nin religious matters. In short, the Quaker theory of sexual equality\ndoes not amount to a fully articulated feminist theory of political\nequality.\n",
