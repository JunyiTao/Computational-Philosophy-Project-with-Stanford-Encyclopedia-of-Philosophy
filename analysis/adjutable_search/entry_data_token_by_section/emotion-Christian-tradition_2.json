Essentialism in the conception of religious emotions\n\nEssentialism in the conception of religious emotions is the view that\nthere is some universal religious emotion \u2014 an emotion or\nemotion-like affection that is the single universal essence of all\nreligious experiences, and the feature that makes them\nproperly religious.\n\nIn the first section of this article, we have assumed diversity among\nthe types of emotion that might be called \u201creligious.\u201d Joy,\ncompassion, remorse, and so forth, are different\nemotion types. The unity we find among them, in\ncontradistinction from \u201csecular\u201d emotions, is their theological\nreference or \u201ccontent.\u201d Insofar as they are distinctively Christian,\nthey all draw on Christian doctrine. Yet they pick from that body of\ndoctrine different bits and deploy them to different purposes.\nThe terms in which the believer construes the object of\ncompassion will differ from the terms in which, when she feels\ngratitude to God, she construes herself, a benefit, and God.\nIndeed, what differentiates one emotion type from another seems to\nbe the terms of the construal.\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834) was a Christian theologian,\nbut he sought to understand the essence of religion in general, of\nwhich Christianity was presumably an instance. He held that the\nessence of religion is piety and that piety consists in the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. What is the feeling of absolute dependence, and\nhow is it related to more specific religious emotions?\n\nFeeling is \u201cimmediate\u201d self-consciousness as contrasted\nwith \u201cthat consciousness of self which is more like an objective\nconsciousness, being a representation of oneself, and thus mediated by\nself-contemplation\u201d (The Christian Faith, \u00a73.2).\nFor Schleiermacher \u2018immediate\u2019 contrasts with\n\u2018analytic\u2019; he seems to have in mind something like what\npeople mean when they say that feelings are\n\u2018non-cognitive\u2019: that they precede and cannot be captured\nin articulate thought. Joy, he says, is a genuine state of feeling,\nbut self-approval \u201cbelong[s] to the objective consciousness of\nself\u201d (ibid.). One might feel joy without knowing why,\nbut presumably self-approval requires that one have reasons; thus the\nformer is immediate, the latter analytic.\n\nSchleiermacher says that at a certain stage of cultural and individual\ndevelopment all human beings have two feelings (states of\nself-consciousness) with respect to the world: the feeling of\nfreedom and the feeling of dependence. The feeling of freedom\ncorresponds to Activity, and is the feeling of being\neffective with respect to changes in the world. This will include\nnot only bringing about physical changes (say, digging a hole in the\nearth) but also perceiving things (perceiving is a sort of activity\nwith respect to the thing perceived) and thinking about them. By\ncontrast, the feeling of dependence corresponds to\nReceptivity and is the feeling of being acted upon by things\nin the world (say, being affected by the food one eats or helped by\nfellow human beings). Vis-\u00e0-vis the world and the\nthings in the world, people always have a mixture of the feeling of\nfreedom and the feeling of dependence. One never has a feeling of\nabsolute (unqualified, schlechthinig) freedom with respect to\nanything, for no matter how active one is with respect to it, there\nwill always be an element of receptivity or dependence on it or some\naspect of it or something closely associated with it.\n\nThe same is true of dependence, as far as the relation to things in\nthe world is concerned. You are never purely or absolutely\ndependent on things in the world. If, for example, you were completely\nparalyzed but still conscious, you would be very dependent, but\npresumably could still focus your attention or this or that thing on\nwhich you were dependent, and to that extent would engage in free\nactivity and have the corresponding feeling. It is another matter,\nhowever, if your thought ventures beyond the world. If you think, not\nof anything in the world, but of the world as a\nwhole (including yourself as part of the world) and then think\nwhat is beyond that, then the feeling you have with respect to that\nabsolute Beyond is absolute \u201cdependence,\u201d in the sense of being\nconscious of having no power with respect to it, being utterly unable\nto affect it (even by perceiving or thinking it). On this account, the\nobject of the feeling of absolute dependence is what is utterly beyond\nthe world or universe, regarded as everything that exists, and it is\nthe feeling of your own impotence with respect to that\n\u201cobject.\u201d\n\nOur natural cognitive equipment suffices to bring about the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. It requires only the idea that existing things\nhave causes and the idea of all existing things taken together. From\nthis we get the idea of God as the cause of all that is. But then\nwe think, if God exists, then God is part of all that is, and\nthe urge for a causal explanation recurs: where did God come from?\nTheists put a stop to this line of thought by declaring that God has\nnecessary existence, and so God, unlike everything else, doesn\u2019t need\nto be caused. But the very question has projected the mind beyond the\nwhole of what exists, to the radical other side of being,\nand that other side is not only absolutely uninflenceable, it is\nnot even thinkable. And so the feeling generated by this thought is\nthe feeling of absolute dependence.\n\nHow is the feeling of absolute dependence related to episodes of the\nparticular religious emotion-types, such as joy, gratitude, hope,\ncontrition, compassion, and sorrow? The short answer is that for\nSchleiermacher the feeling of absolute dependence is the essentially\nreligious element in these emotions (see ibid.,\n\u00a75.4\u20135). Without that element, no emotion would be\nreligious. The feeling of absolute dependence is, in itself, not about\nevents taking place in the world; it is about what is beyond\neverything that exists, so its \u201cobject\u201d is completely\nunchanging. The particular religious emotions, by contrast, are\nresponses, some pleasant and some unpleasant, to changes in the finite\nor sensible self-consciousness. Gratitude, for example, is a response\nto a particular kind of situation in which the subject is the\nrecipient of some benefit; contrition is a response to a situation in\nwhich the subject has committed some fault; and so forth. In a more\ntraditional theology, the difference between gratitude to a kind\nneighbor for a benefit and religious gratitude would be that in the\nlatter case the subject is grateful to God for the benefit.\nThe subject would causally attribute the benefit to God. Similarly,\nthe difference between feeling guilty for having lied to one\u2019s\nneighbor and religious contrition would be that the subject would\nthink of his fault as having offended God. Something like\nthis idea is behind Schleiermacher\u2019s claim that the feeling of\nabsolute dependence is the religious element in every religious\nemotion. However, he certainly does not think of the Beyond as\nactually supplying worldly benefits to people, or as being actually\noffended when they perform nasty actions. This would bring the Beyond\nsmack into the world and thus destroy the feeling of absolute\ndependence. Schleiermacher does not give a careful account of the\nrelation between the feeling of absolute dependence and the particular\nemotions, but just says that the feeling \u201cunites with a sensibly\ndetermined self-consciousness, and thus becomes an emotion\n(Erregung)\u2026\u201d (ibid., \u00a75.5). I\noffer the following as a possible clarification, using the example of\ngratitude: some impressive good befalls me, and I recognize it as\nsuch. This recognition is an empirically ascertainable consciousness\nof myself, thus a \u201csensibly determined\nself-consciousness.\u201d Then, in conjunction with this sensibly\ndetermined consciousness of being \u201cmoved\u201d with gratitude,\nI have the feeling of absolute dependence; and thus my ordinary\ngratitude becomes religious, or in traditional terms I am moved with\ngratitude to God.\n\nOne might think that mood would be a better category than\nemotion for interpreting Schleiermacher\u2019s comments about the\nfeeling (Gef\u00fchl) of absolute dependence. (On the\ndifferences between emotion and mood, see Beedie, Terry, and Lane,\n2005.) Feeling is a broader category than emotion. Both moods and\nemotions can be felt, and the diffuseness of the feeling of absolute\ndependence might be thought to warrant this change of category.\nFurthermore, we might see in this change an opportunity to explain\nbetter the relation between the feeling of absolute dependence and the\nparticular religious emotions. Moods, it seems, predispose emotions:\nif you\u2019re irritable, you\u2019re more likely to get angry upon being\ninsulted; if you\u2019re cheerful, you\u2019re more likely to feel joy upon\nbeing told good news; and so forth. And this, we might think, is due\nto the fact that the particular emotions not only are predisposed by\nmoods, but themselves embody moods: joy is cheerful, sorrow is\ndepressed, anger is irritable, and so forth. Similarly, if you\u2019re\nfeeling absolutely dependent, you\u2019re more likely to feel\nreligiously contrite, joyful, grateful, and so forth, and\neach of these particular emotion types embodies the feeling of\nabsolute dependence. This is perhaps a useful suggestion, inasmuch as\nSchleiermacher takes the feeling of absolute dependence to be implicit\nin all religious emotions. One objection to assimilating the feeling\nof absolute dependence to mood would be that\nintentionality seems to be a feature of emotions that\ndistinguishes them from moods, and Schleiermacher clearly specifies\nthe intentionality of the feeling of absolute dependence.\n\nThe feeling of absolute dependence, conceived as Schleiermacher\nconceives it, presents him with several problems that he does not seem\nto resolve. 1) Despite his claim that the feeling is\n\u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense of non-cognitive, we have just\ngiven a quite cognitive account of the feeling. It seems to depend on\na particular way of thinking about the world and what is beyond the\nworld. Both world and agent need to be thought of in terms of effect\nand receptivity to effect; and then the Beyond needs to be conceived\nin analogy and contrast with this aspect of the world, in its relation\nto the agent (subject of the feeling). A person who did not engage in\nthis process of thought, at least covertly or subconsciously, would\nnever get to the feeling of absolute dependence as Schleiermacher\ndescribes it. 2) Schleiermacher is a Christian theologian and thinks\nhe has given an account of the most basic experience of God. But any\nGod who existed would be part of the \u201cworld\u201d on\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception and thus could not be the object of the\nfeeling of absolute dependence. Furthermore, the God of Christian\ntradition is not utterly incapable of being affected by human beings.\nGod responds to states of the world with actions and emotions, and\nhears and answers prayer. 3) Absolutizing the dependency relationship\nin the way that Schleiermacher does seems to evacuate\n\u2018dependency\u2019 of its usual meaning. The \u201cother\u201d\ntowards which one feels absolutely \u201cdependent\u201d in\nSchleiermacher\u2019s conception must be predicateless to protect it\nagainst any influence (in particular, epistemic contact) from the side\nof the world; but that move eliminates any positive sense in which we\ndepend on it. Absolute dependence in the object comes to equal\nabsolute incapability of being affected, and the feeling of absolute\ndependence amounts to a feeling of complete lack of effective agency\nvis-\u00e0-vis the other \u2014 that is, it becomes a\npurely negative conception. So the feeling of absolute dependence\nmight better be called the feeling of absolute impotence.\n\nA prominent representative of the essentialist thinking about\nreligious emotion of which Schleiermacher seems to be the\noriginator is Rudolf Otto in The Idea of the Holy\n(published 1923). The feeling basic to religion is that of the\nnuminous, of the mysterium tremendum et fascinans (roughly,\n\u201cthe mysterious presence of the wholly other that inspires awe\nand devotion\u201d). \u201cThere is no religion in which it does not\nlive as the real innermost core, and without it no religion would be\nworthy of the name\u201d (p. 6). This feeling is not in itself\nethical; it is not, for example, the feeling of being in the presence\nof a moral judge or command-giver. Thus religion is not just a kind of\nethics, as Kant tended to think. The numinous feeling is \u201ca\nunique original feeling-response, which can be in itself ethically\nneutral and claims consideration in its own right\u201d\n(ibid.). The feeling bears some resemblance to, but also\ndiffers from, a sense of dread, of horror, of the uncanny, the eerie,\nthe weird; it also corresponds to a kind of \u201cwrath\u201d of the\ndivine, a divine demeanor that has about it something incalculable and\narbitrary, a kind of unpredictable majestic overpowering fearsomeness.\nHowever, one can have a feeling of the mysterium that is not\nfear-like; a feeling not of tremor, but of stupor.\n\u201cStupor is plainly a different thing from tremor; it signifies\nblank wonder, an astonishment that strikes us dumb, amazement\nabsolute\u201d (p. 26).\n\nOtto does not attempt to give us a straightforward grammar of the\nnuminous feeling, and says in fact that this cannot be done. Instead,\nhe approaches it by comparing it with other experiences and trying out\nvarious terms that might approach to it in meaning, without exactly\ngetting it; then the idea is that the reader will find the feeling\namong his own experiences, and thus be informed. Otto chides\nSchleiermacher for making the feeling of absolute dependence a mode of\nself-consciousness and for leaving the non-subjective object of the\nfeeling uncharacterized (p. 10). Contrary to Schleiermacher, Otto says\nthe concept of causation is absent from the most basic feeling.\n\u201cThe point from which speculation starts is not a\n\u2018consciousness of absolute dependence\u2019 \u2014 of myself\nas a result and effect of a divine cause \u2014 for that would in\npoint of fact lead to insistence upon the reality of the self [which\non Otto\u2019s construction virtually disappears in the confrontation with\nthe mysterium tremendum]; it starts from a consciousness of\nthe absolute superiority or supremacy of a power other than myself,\nand it is only as it falls back upon ontological terms to achieve its\nend \u2014 terms generally borrowed from natural science \u2014 that\nthat element of the tremendum, originally apprehended as\n\u2018plenitude of power\u2019, becomes transmuted into\n\u2018plenitude of being\u2019\u201d (p. 21).\n\nWe can see two tendencies in Otto\u2019s thought: his striving to make the\nnuminous feeling sui generis, to protect it from\nencroachments of other spheres such as ethics and science; and his\nstriving to make it do justice to the variety of the emotions that\nactually occur in religious life. These tendencies are hard to combine\nin a consistent account, especially if the supposed encroachments of\nthe \u201cother spheres\u201d are actually native to the religion\nwhose emotions are being examined. For example, Christianity is a\nreligion whose theology is an ethics, an ethics of justice,\ntruthfulness, compassion for the poor and suffering, and of mutual\nlove in the community. In the ideal case, the emotions that are\ngenerated from thinking, caring, and acting by the standards of\nChristian theology are emotions that express ethical character.\n\nCommenting on the kind of essentialism about religious experience that\nSchleiermacher and Otto represent, William James says:\n\nConsider \u2026 the \u2018religious sentiment\u2019 which we see\nreferred to in so many books, as if it were a single sort of mental\nentity. In the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we\nfind the authors attempting to specify just what entity it is. One man\nallies it to the feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from\nfear; others connect it with the sexual life; others still identify it\nwith the feeling of the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of\nconceiving it ought of themselves to arouse doubt as to whether it\npossibly can be one specific thing; and the moment we are willing to\ntreat the term \u2018religious sentiment\u2019 as a collective name\nfor the many sentiments which religious objects may arouse in\nalternation, we see that it probably contains nothing whatever of a\npsychologically specific nature. There is religious fear, religious\nlove, religious joy, and so forth. But religious love is only man\u2019s\nnatural emotion of love directed to a religious object; religious fear\nis only the ordinary fear of commerce, so to speak, the common quaking\nof the human breast, in so far as the notion of divine retribution may\narouse it; religious awe is the same organic thrill which we feel in a\nforest at twilight, or in a mountain gorge; only this time it comes\nover us at the thought of our supernatural relations; and similarly of\nall the various sentiments which may be called into play in the lives\nof religious persons. As concrete states of mind, made up of a feeling\nplus a specific sort of object, religious emotions of course are\npsychic entities distinguishable from other concrete emotions; but\nthere is no ground of assuming a simply abstract \u2018religious\nemotion\u2019 to exist as a distinct elementary mental affection by\nitself, present in every religious experience without exception\n(The Varieties of Religious Experience, Lecture II, p. 46).\n\n\nJames here assimilates religious emotions to emotions more generally,\nand eschews the project of trying to identify some particular\nemotion-type to which every instance of religious emotion belongs and\nwhich makes it religious. But a few pages later (p. 49) he\n\u201carbitrarily\u201d for purposes of his exposition says that\nreligion is the feelings, acts, and experiences of individuals when\nthey apprehend themselves to be in the presence of the divine.\nSupposing that diversity among conceptions of the divine will engender\ndiversity among emotional experiences of the divine, and the diversity\namong types of emotions will reflect differences in ways experiences\nof the divine bear on the diverse situations of life, the Jamesian\npicture seems compatible with our brief exposition of emotions in the\nNew Testament at the beginning of this article.\n\nA question can be raised whether the famous Jamesian theory of\nemotions, referred to in this quotation, is the best account for\nunderstanding religious emotions. That theory holds that the emotion\nitself is a \u201cquaking of the human breast\u201d or an\n\u201corganic thrill,\u201d where such physiological perturbations\nare caused (aroused) by \u201cobjects.\u201d The cause of the\nquaking may be a bear approaching on the forest path, or it may be the\nthought of divine retribution. The quaking is religious just in case\nit is caused by a divine object \u2014 or at least a thought\nthereof.\n",
