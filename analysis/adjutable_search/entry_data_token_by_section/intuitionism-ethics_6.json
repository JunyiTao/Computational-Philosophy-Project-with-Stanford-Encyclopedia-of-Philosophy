    "main_text": "Intuitionist metaphysics || Analyses of concepts and property identity claims.\n2.2 Analyses of concepts and property identity claims.\n\n\nA naturalist might accept that the open question argument works in\nrelation to moral concepts, but deny that we can make any inferences\n about the way the world is from the fact that we think of it in certain\n ways.[15]\n For the way in which\nwe think about the world is determined by our understanding of the\nconcepts we use to describe it, and we cannot reliably infer that the\nworld is a certain way from the fact that we conceive of it in that\nway. To think that one can make such inferences is to confuse\n predicates or concepts with\n properties,[16]\n analytical identities with synthetic identities.\nWe know what we mean by certain concepts by a priori reflection, but\nthe nature of the things to which these concepts refer can only be\ndiscovered by empirical investigation. We did not discover that water\nis H2O or that heat is mean kinetic molecular energy by a priori\nreflection on what we mean by \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018heat\u2019, but by empirical investigation. Furthermore, we\ncould not object to the view that heat is mean kinetic energy on the\nground that this is not what we mean when we think of something as hot.\nBut the intuitionists seem to object to naturalistic accounts of moral\nproperties in precisely this way.\n\n\nThere is, however, reason to think that intuitionists such as Moore and\nRoss did not confuse concepts and properties. For they were careful to\ndistinguish an elucidation of the meaning of words and an account of\nthe nature of the world with their distinction between proper verbal\ndefinitions and the sort of definitions they are interested in (viz.,\n metaphysical\n ones).[17]\n A proper verbal definition of \u2018good\u2019 is simply an account of\nhow most people use the word, whereas a metaphysical definition is one\nthat tells us the nature of the thing of which the concept is a\n concept.[18]\n This is not\nquite the distinction between an analysis of a concept and an account\nof the nature of a corresponding property, but it is close enough to\ngive us reason to suppose that intuitionists such as Moore and Ross\nwere aware of the distinction between concepts and properties that many\nthink they simply conflate.\n\n\nBut although intuitionists may not have confused concepts and\nproperties, they did seem to believe that there is a certain\nisomorphism between the structure of our concepts and the nature of the\nworld, such that a proper analysis of our concepts would reveal to us\nthe nature of the corresponding property or thing. This belief is not\nobviously confused, but the examples of heat and water seem to show\nthat it cannot be accepted as it stands. Intuitionists need not,\nhowever, rest their view about the property of goodness on a general\nthesis about the relation of concepts and properties. All they need do\nis identify what it is about certain concepts, like the concepts of\nwater and heat, that provides us with reasons to think that the\ncorresponding properties are different, and then argue that these\nreasons do not apply to the concept of goodness.\n\n\nWith concepts of natural properties and substances like heat and water\nwe have two reasons for thinking that the corresponding properties may\nbe different. First, the concept of heat seems metaphysically\nsuperficial and incomplete. It is the concept of a property that has\ncertain characteristic effects on us and on other things, but does not\naim to tell us about the nature of the property that has those effects.\nThe concept of water seems superficial in the same way. This concept\nonly picks out certain surface features of water, such as its being\nclear, odourless, tasteless, etc. It does not, however, tell us\nanything about the nature of the substance that has these features. In\nboth cases empirical science seems well-suited to complete this picture\nby investigating the property or substance that has these distinctive\neffects, or surface features. In doing this, empirical science provides\nus with an account of heat and water which is metaphysically deeper\nthan the one provided by the corresponding concepts.\n\n\nSecondly, even if the concept of heat were not incomplete or\nsuperficial, in so far as it is a concept of a natural property we have\ngood reason to think that the empirical sciences are much better\nequipped to discover the nature of heat than a priori reflection. The\nsame is true of the concept of water. In so far as this is a concept of\na natural substance, the empirical sciences are far better suited to\ntell us the nature of this substance than a priori reflection.\n\n\nThese reasons do not apply to the concept of goodness. First, this\nconcept does not seem to be metaphysically superficial or incomplete in\nthe way that the concept of heat or water is. When we think of\nsomething as good we do not think of it merely as having certain\neffects on us, or as picking out certain surface properties the\nproperty of goodness has, but think of it as having a distinctive\ncharacteristic. Not all intuitionists agreed with Moore that nothing\ncould be said about the nature of this characteristic (though they all\nagreed that this is a non-natural property). A. C. Ewing, for example,\nmaintained that the characteristic we have in mind when we think of\nsomething as being good is the property it has of being the fitting\nobject of a pro-attitude. If this, or something like it, is correct,\nthen the concept of goodness does not merely describe certain\nproperties goodness has, but aspires to tell us what\ngoodness\n is.[19]\nIt does not, therefore,\ncall for a metaphysically deeper account from some other source in the\nway that the concept of heat or water does.\n\n\nIt is not, however, clear that this argument will persuade critics of\nintuitionism and nonnaturalism. They may want more from an analysis of\n\u2018good\u2019. They might, for example, want an analysis that\nhelps explain why some things rather than others are good, and which\nexplains the connection between the properties that make something\ngood, and its goodness. Without these explanatory features they may\nwell regard the analysis of good offered by Ewing superficial and in\nneed of a metaphysically deeper account.\n\n\nIndeed, as Robert Shaver points out (2007, 289) according to one\nintuitionist account of good the analysis does call for a\nmetaphysically deeper account of the nature of the property. C. D.\nBroad, for instance, analyses good as meaning \n\u201cthere is one and\nonly one characteristic or set of characteristics whose presence in any\nobject that I contemplate is necessary to make me contemplate it with\napproval\u201d (1985, 283). Critics may claim that this analysis is\njust as plausible as Ewing\u2019s, and leaves room for an alternative,\nnaturalist account of the property that explains my approval.\n\n\nShaver also points out that it is a mistake to assume that synthetic\nidentities can only be established by empirical means. This is a\nmistake, because one could arrive at the conclusion that two different\nnotions refer to the same property by a priori reflection. So even if\nno empirical investigation can show that a moral and a non-moral term\npick out the same property, this might still be shown by a priori\nreflection.\n",
