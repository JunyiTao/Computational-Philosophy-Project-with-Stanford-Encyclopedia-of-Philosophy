A well known example is the\nvelocity of an object in classical mechanics. The velocity is always\nimplicitly or explicitly relative to a second object. There is no\n\u201cvelocity of a single object\u201d, irrespectively on any other\nobject, in classical mechanics. Other well-known examples are the\nelectric potential (only the potential of a conductor with respect to\nanother conductor has physical meaning) and position (only position\nwith respect to some other object has physical meaning). Relational\nquantum mechanics takes a further long step in this direction,\nassuming that we can make sense of quantum mechanics by assuming that\nall physical variables are relational in this sense.\n\nRQM is sometimes wrongly assumed to be an interpretation where\nsubjects, or agents, play a role. The source of the misunderstanding\nis the confusion between relative and subjective. When we say that the\nour speed is 11km/second with respect to the sun, we are not assuming\nthat the sun has subjectivity. When we say that the distance between a\nsignpost and a road intersection is 100 meters, we are not thinking\nthat a road\u2019s intersection is an agent. In a naturalistic\nperspective, a person, an agent, a subject, are physical systems. On\nthe other hand, the world this person, agent, or subject, relates to\nis described by the value of the variables with respect to\nthe physical system she is. This is like saying that a subject\ndwelling on the Earth sees the Cosmos rotating because the Earth is\nspinning. To say that RQM requires subjects or agents is the same\nmistake as saying that our explanation of the daily rotation of sun\nmoon and stars around the Earth requires to take agency or\nsubjectivity into account: an obvious nonsense. There is nothing\nsubjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM.\n",
