    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Unpublished Notebooks\n6. Nietzsche\u2019s Unpublished Notebooks\n\nNietzsche\u2019s unpublished writings often reveal his more tentative\nand speculative ideas. This material is surrounded by controversy,\nsince some of it conflicts with views he expresses in his published\nworks. Disagreement regarding Nietzsche\u2019s notebooks, also known\nas his Nachlass, centers around the degree of interpretive\npriority which ought to be given to the unpublished versus the\npublished writings. One popular approach in the tradition of classical\nscholarly interpretation is to maintain that Nietzsche\u2019s\npublished works express his more considered and polished views, and\nthat these should take precedence over the unpublished manuscripts\nwhen conflicts arise; a second attitude, given voice by Martin\nHeidegger (who lectured on Nietzsche in Nazi Germany,\n1936\u20131940), and broadly consistent with a psychoanalytic\napproach as well, is to regard what Nietzsche published as\nrepresentative of what he decided was publicly presentable, and what\nhe kept privately to himself in unpublished form as containing his\nmore authentic views; a third, more comprehensive, interpretive style\ntries to grasp all of Nietzsche\u2019s texts together in an effort to\nform the most coherent interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s thought,\njudging the priority of published versus unpublished works on a\nthematic, or case-by-case basis; a fourth position influenced by the\nFrench deconstructionist perspective maintains that any rigid\nprioritizing between published and private works is impossible, since\nall of the texts embody a comparable multidimensionality of\nmeaning.\n\nIn his unpublished manuscripts, Nietzsche sometimes elaborates the\ntopics found in the published works, such as his early 1870s\nnotebooks, where there is important material concerning his theory of\nknowledge. In the 1880s notebooks\u2014those from which his sister\ncollected together a large selection after his death under the title,\nThe Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of all\nValues\u2014Nietzsche sometimes adopts a more metaphysical\norientation towards the doctrines of Eternal Recurrence and the Will\nto Power, speculating upon their structure, implications, and\nintellectual strength as interpretations of reality itself.\nSide-by-side with these speculations, and complicating efforts towards\ndeveloping an interpretation which is both comprehensive and coherent,\nNietzsche\u2019s 1880s notebooks also repeatedly state that\n\u201cthere are no facts, only interpretations.\u201d\n",
