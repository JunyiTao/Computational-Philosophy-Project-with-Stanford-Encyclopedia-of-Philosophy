    "main_text": "The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill\n4. The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill\n\nAs said in its first lesson, the Course pursues two goals.\nThe first, a specific one, is a foundation for sociology, then called\n\u2018social physics\u2019. The second, a general goal, is the\ncoordination of the whole of positive knowledge. The structure of the\nwork reflects this duality: the first three volumes examine the five\nfundamental sciences then in existence (mathematics, astronomy,\nphysics, chemistry, biology), and the final three volumes deal with\nthe social sciences. Executing the two parts did not require the same\namount of work. In the first case, the sciences had already been\nformed and it was just a matter of summarizing their main doctrinal\nand methodological points. In the other case, however, all was still\nto be done, and Comte was well aware that he was founding a new\nscience.\n",
