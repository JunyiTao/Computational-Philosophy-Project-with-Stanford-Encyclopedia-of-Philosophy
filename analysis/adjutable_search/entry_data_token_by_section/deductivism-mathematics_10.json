    "main_text": "A Regress?\n7. A Regress?\n\nWe turn now to the third challenge. To introduce it, consider whether\ndeductivism should apply to a sentence such as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\)\n\n\n(As usual, we write \\(Ax\\) to preserve neutrality on what the axioms\nare exactly; see\n \u00a74\n for the options here.) Since proof theory appears to be a branch of\nmathematics like any other, you might suppose that a consistent\ndeductivist should construe this sentence like any other mathematical\none. In which case, the sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d should be\nconstrued not as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\),\n\n\nbut instead as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201cthe sentence \u2018\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u2019\ndeductively follows from \\(Ax\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax'\\).\n\n\n(Where \\(Ax'\\) may or may not be identical to \\(Ax\\)\u2014this will\nnot affect the main point.) Now if a deductivist is to go down to this\nroute, she will also have to construe this last sentence like any\nother mathematical one. So it should be glossed in the same way. The\nsame applies to the resulting gloss, and so on without end. Clearly,\nwe are off on an infinite regress.\n\nIt seems to follow that for the deductivist there is no finite\nformulation of the sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d. Any such\nformulation would have to be infinite, and, if it ends at all, must\nend in a sentence \\(s\\) that is a \u201cfixed-point\u201d of this\niteration. In other words, \\(s\\) must be identical (not just logically\nequivalent) to \u201cthe sentence \\(s\\) deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\)\u201d (for some \\(Ax)\\) since \\(s\\) is construed by the\ndeductivist as\n\n\nthe sentence \\(s\\) deductively follows from \\(Ax\\)\n\n\nWhether such a sentence exists is highly dubious. Even if it does, an\ninfinitely long sentence, with infinitely many embeddings, is an\nabsurdly complicated way to interpret \u201c\\(2+ 2 = 4\\)\u201d,\nwhich after all is one of the simplest sentences of mathematics,\nindeed of the English language.\n\nThe objection just raised is premised on the idea that provability\nclaims are mathematical. To support this premise, the\nobjection\u2019s proponent might point out that results in proof\ntheory are typically infused with mathematics. Our conviction that\nsome statement is provable in a deductive system is not usually a\nresult of having carried out the proof ourselves, starting from the\naxioms and applying the rules of inference to derive the theorem.\nRather, it often follows from more abstract mathematical\nreasoning.\n\nHow should the deductivist reply to this challenge? She can agree that\nwe use mathematics, sometimes even quite sophisticated mathematics, to\ndetermine what deductively follows from some axioms. That is an\nepistemological point. But it does not affect her thesis\nabout what mathematics is. For the deductivist, the truth of\na mathematical claim \\(p\\) consists in its being a theorem of an\nappropriate deductive system \\(D\\). How we determine what\n\\(D\\)\u2019s theorems are may require mathematics\u2014this is to\napply mathematics to proof systems\u2014and perhaps other machinery,\nbut that, to repeat, is an epistemological point. The fact that \\(p\\)\nis a theorem of \\(D\\) is a fact about a deductive system, namely that\nthere is a sequence of formulas starting from axioms and proceeding by\nrules of the system concluding in \\(p\\). As the deductivist sees\nit\u2014as she has to see it, to avoid the\nregress\u2014this fact is not mathematical, even if we must\nuse mathematics to determine whether it holds or not. (Compare the\nclaim that a large meteor will land on Earth before 2050: a physical\nfact, but one we verify or falsify using sophisticated\nmathematics.)\n\nIn short, to avoid the regress, deductivists should not apply their\ninterpretation strategy to claims of deductive consequence. For any\nsentence \\(s\\) and well-specified deductive system \\(D\\), whether\n\\(D\\) proves \\(s\\) or not should be taken to be a determinate fact.\nSuch facts are the cornerstone of her philosophy and should not be\n\u201cdeductivised\u201d. Rather than have the deductivist recipe\napplied to them, they must be taken at face\n value.[15]\n",
