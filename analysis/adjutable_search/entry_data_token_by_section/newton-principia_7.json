Book 3 of the Principia\n\n\nSave for the short opening sections, \u201cRegulae\nPhilosophandi\u201d and \u201cPhenomena,\u201d Book 3, in contrast to\nBooks 1 and 2, is not marked off into sections. Nevertheless, the\nmain body of it does consist of four clearly separate parts: (1) the\nderivation of the law of gravity (Props. 1-8); (2) implications of this\nlaw for orbital and rotating bodies (from the corollaries to Prop. 8\nthrough Prop. 24); (3) a quantitative derivation of select lunar\ninequalities and the precession of the equinoxes from the law of\ngravity (Props. 25-39); and (4) a solution for comet trajectories, with\nexamples and comments (Props. 40-42). These parts will be\ndiscussed in sequence below.\n\n\nNewton's first two rules of reasoning appeared in the first edition\n(there labeled as\n hypotheses[41]),\nthe third rule was added in the second\nedition, and the fourth rule, in the third edition. These are\nrules intended to govern evidential reasoning in natural philosophy,\nakin to rules of deductive reasoning except for their very much not\nguaranteeing true conclusions from true premises. In particular,\nRule 2 authorizes the inference from same effect to same cause, a\nnotoriously invalid inference, and Rule 3 authorizes inductive\ngeneralization to all bodies universally of those qualities of bodies\n\u201cthat belong to all bodies on which experiments can be made.\u201d\nNewton's phrasing carries no suggestion that these rules yield truths\nor even a high probability of truth. The operative phrase in both\nRules 3 and 4, for example, is properly translated \u201cshould be taken,\u201d\nand Rule 4 makes the provisional character of the authorized inferences\nexplicit:\n\nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena\nby induction should be taken to be either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena\nmake such propositions either more exact or liable to\nexceptions.\n\n\nThe philosophic question why Newton's rules are appropriate is best\naddressed not by asking how they increase the probability of truth, but\nby asking whether there is some strategy in ongoing research for which\nthese rules will both promote further discoveries and safeguard against\ndead-end garden paths that ultimately require all the supposed\ndiscoveries to be discarded.\n\n\nSix astronomical phenomena are listed and discussed in the section\ncalled \u201cPhenomena\u201d \u2014 most importantly, that\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the satellites of the\nlatter two sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the\ncentral bodies of their respective orbits, and their periods vary as\nthe 3/2 power of their mean distances from these bodies.  The ellipse,\nby the way, is not one of the phenomena. In Phenomenon 3 Newton rules\nout the Ptolemaic system, just as Galileo had in his Dialogue\nConcerning the Two Chief World Systems, by appealing to the\nphases of Mercury and Venus and their absence in the case of Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn to conclude that these five orbits encircle the\nSun. But this Phenomenon and all the others are carefully formulated\nto remain neutral between the Copernican and Tychonic systems. In\nPhenomenon 4 Boulliau's calculated orbits are treated on a par with\nKepler's, indicating that the phenomena do not rule out the\npossibility that Boulliau's alternative to the area rule is correct.\nPhenomenon 6 explicitly grants that the area rule holds only\napproximately for the Moon, with a further remark indicating that none\nof the phenomena are being put forward as holding exactly. This points\nthe way to the most reasonable reading of all of the phenomena: they\ndescribe to reasonably high approximation, but not more than that, the\nobservations of the planets and their satellites made by Tycho and\nothers over a finite period of time \u2014 roughly from 1570 to the\ntime of Newton's writing. On this way of viewing the Phenomena, they\nare in no way contentious or problematic. They leave entirely open not\nonly questions about whether any claims concerning the orbits made by\nKepler and his contemporaries hold exactly, but also questions about\nwhether any of these claims hold even remotely in other eras, past or\nfuture. The Phenomena are thus not inconsistent with Descartes'\ninsistence that the motions are constantly changing.\n\n\nThe \u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of universal gravity from the phenomena in\nthe first eight propositions of Book 3 has provoked a great deal of\ncontroversy in the philosophical literature over the last century\nor\n so.[42]\nAt\nthe heart of this controversy is the challenge posed by Pierre Duhem:\nhow can a deduction proceed from premises (the planets sweep out equal\nareas in equal times and their orbits are stationary) to a conclusion,\nthe law of gravity, that then implies that the premises are false (the\nplanets do not sweep out equal areas in equal times and the orbits are\nnot stationary, but instead\n precess)?[43]\nThe answer is simple: Newton's\nreasoning is approximative. He is using \u201cif, then\u201d statements\nthat have been shown in Book 1 to hold in \u201cif \u2026 quam\nproxime, then \u2026 quam proxime\u201d form to infer\nconclusions from premises that hold at least quam proxime over\na restricted period of time. Of course, this means that the\ndeduction shows only that the conclusions, most notably the law of\ngravity, hold quam proxime over the restricted period of time\nfor which the premises hold. The Rules of Reasoning then license\nthe conclusion to be taken exactly, without restriction of space or\ntime. The conclusions, so taken, do indeed then show that the\npremises hold only quam proxime, and not exactly. This\nconclusion in no way contradicts the premises.\n\n\nRecognizing that Newton's reasoning is approximative answers another\ncomplaint about the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity: Newton invokes\nthe proposition, if bodies move uniformly in concentric circular\norbits whose periods vary as the 3/2 power of the radii, then the\ncentripetal forces acting on these bodies vary as the inverse-square of\nthe radii of the orbits, knowing full well that observation had\nestablished for centuries that the planets do not move uniformly in\ncircular\n orbits.[44]\nNewton does indeed invoke this\nproposition first to conclude (in Prop. 1) that, in modern parlance,\nthere is an inverse-square centripetal acceleration field around\nJupiter and Saturn and next to conclude (in Prop. 2) that there is an\ninverse-square centripetal acceleration field around the\n Sun.[45]\nThe\norbits of the satellites of Jupiter were then considered to be\ncircular, and hence Newton's inference from their motion was not so\nproblematic. While, however, the orbits of Venus, Jupiter, and\nSaturn were considered to be very nearly circular, the motion in them\nhad been known from before Ptolemy not to be uniform. Newton\nexpressly concedes that his inference of the inverse-square from the\n3/2 power rule for the planets is only approximate when, in the very\nnext sentence, he remarks, \u201cBut this second part of the proposition is\nproved with the greatest exactness from the fact that the aphelia are\nat rest.\u201d The absence of precession, however, can be used to\ninfer the inverse-square only for each orbit individually, not a\nsingle, unified inverse-square centripetal acceleration field\nencompassing all of the orbits. Newton is accordingly using the\n3/2 rule for circular orbits to establish that an inverse-square field\nholds around the Sun to at least a first approximation, and then using\nthe absence of precession of the individual orbits to tighten the\napproximation.\n\n\nInterpreting Newton's deduction of universal gravity as an exercise in\napproximative reasoning answers a further complaint of Duhem's: insofar\nas the area rule holds only to high approximation, so too do any number\nof alternatives to it, such as Boulliau's geometric construction, and\nhence Newton's \u201cdeduction\u201d begs the question of why the area rule is to\nbe preferred to these\n alternatives.[46]\nThis question, however, is irrelevant\nso long as the conclusion remains in the weak form, the law of gravity\nholds quam proxime for the planets and their satellites over\nthe time period for which observations have shown the phenomena to hold\nquam proxime. The phenomena really are sufficient to\nreach the conclusion in this weak form. So, the complaint has\nbite only when the law of gravity is taken to be exact. But\nthere, however, Newton does provide a response to it when he concludes\nin Propositions 13 and 14 that the planets would describe\nareas exactly proportional to the times in stationary orbits if \u201cthe\nSun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon\none\n another.\u201d[47]\n The reason, then, why the phenomena from which Newton proceeded in\nthe deduction have claim to being preferred to alternatives to them is\nthat the theory deduced from them, when taken to hold exactly,\nidentifies circumstances under which the phenomena would hold exactly,\nas well. That this be the case amounts to a requirement on the\ndeduction from phenomena: the leap to taking the law of gravity as\nexact is justified only if it yields circumstances in which the\nphenomena from which it was inferred would hold\n exactly.[48]\n\n\nThis analysis of the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity does\nnot answer two further complaints lodged against it. First, in\nconcluding that the centripetal force acting on the Moon is\ninverse-square, Newton grants that the precession of the lunar orbit\nimplies an exponent of -2 and 4/243 for the force rather than exactly\n-2, but then claims that the small fraction can be accounted for by\nthe perturbing action of the Sun's gravity. But the magnitude for the\naction of the Sun that he gives in Proposition\n 3[49]\nis twice the value he later in Book 3\nindicates is the correct value. This lacuna was not resolved by\nAlexis-Claude Clairaut until two decades after Newton died.\nSecond, when Newton invokes the third law of motion in the corollaries\nto Proposition 5, he is tacitly assuming that, for example, Jupiter and\nthe Sun are, in effect, directly interacting. In other words, he\nis ignoring the alternative favored by Huygens that some unseen medium\nis effecting the centripetal force on Jupiter, a medium that can in\nprinciple absorb the linear momentum which Newton is assuming is being\ntransferred to the Sun. Huygens may well have perceived this\nlacuna, to which Cotes explicitly called Newton's attention while he\nwas preparing the second\n edition.[50]\n\n\nThe group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity\ngives indications of the evidential strategy that lies behind the leap\nto taking this law to be exact. Immediately upon concluding first\nthat the planets would sweep out equal areas in equal times in exact\nellipses and then that the orbits would be exactly stationary were it\nnot for the gravitational interactions among the planets, Newton calls\nattention to the easiest to observe deviations from this idealization,\nthe then still mysterious vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn\nwhich Newton attributes to their gravitational interaction.\nBecause, according to the theory, the idealization would hold exactly\nin the specified circumstances, these and all other deviations must\nresult from further forces not taken into account in the idealized\ncase. Identifying these forces and showing that, according to the\ntheory, they do produce the deviations is a way for ongoing research to\nmarshal continuing evidence to bear on the theory of gravity. To\nput the point differently, the initial idealizations that Newton\nidentifies can serve as the starting point for a process of successive\napproximations that should yield increasingly close agreement with the\ncomplex true motions. These idealizations are especially well\nsuited for this purpose precisely because, according to the theory,\nthey would hold exactly were no other forces at work, and hence every\ndeviation from them should be physically telling, and not just, for\nexample, an accidental feature of a curve-fit. Pursuit of such a\nresearch program of successive approximations promises to yield either\nfurther evidence for the theory of gravity when the program is\nsuccessful or the exceptions Newton speaks of in Rule 4 that require\nthe theory to be revised.\n\n\nOf the other results developed in the group of propositions following\nthe deduction of universal gravity, the most heralded at the time were\nthe defense of Copernicanism in Proposition 12 and the identification\nof the cause of the tides in Proposition 24 \u2014 two topics that Kepler,\nGalileo, and Descartes had all addressed. Nevertheless, the two\nPropositions that proved most important were 19 and 20, which\nrespectively derive the non-spheroidal figure of the Earth and the\nvariation of surface gravity with latitude under the assumption that\nthe density of the Earth is uniform. This is the only passage in\nthe Principia that Newton reworked extensively in both the\nsecond and then again in the third edition. As Newton was fully\naware, and Huygens and a few others realized, these are the only\nresults in the Principia that depend on universal\ngravity \u2014 that is, inverse-square gravity directed toward every\nparticle of matter forming the Earth \u2014 and not merely macroscopic\ncelestial gravity \u2014 inverse-square gravity directed toward\ncelestial bodies. In his Discourse on the Cause of\nGravity, Huygens offered an alternative theoretical account of the\nfigure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, and he\nclaimed to have evidence confirming it and hence refuting Newton's\nuniversal\n gravity.[51]\nIn part because evidence on the figure\nof the Earth and the variation of gravity with latitude were accessible\nin expeditions to the equator, these were the results in the\nPrincipia that were the first to receive concerted critical\nattention during the 1730s and 1740s. There was a complication in\nall this, however. The extremely precise results for both the\nfigure of the Earth and the variation of gravity that Newton tabulated\nin the second and third editions were based on uniform density, and\nhence, just like Keplerian motion, represented an idealization,\ndepartures from which would point to non-uniformities of density.\nNot until Clairaut's Theory of the Figure of the Earth did\nmeans become available to calculate the effects of non-uniformities in\nthe\n density.[52]\n\n\nPropositions 25 through 35 derive quantitative results for three lunar\ninequalities \u2014 the systematic departure from the area rule called the\n\u201cthe variation,\u201d the 18 year motion of the line of nodes, and the\nfluctuating inclination of the orbit \u2014 from the perturbing action of\nthe Sun. For all three Newton starts with a circular orbit, so\nthese too involve departures from an idealization. The values he\nobtained for the different components of the solar perturbing force in\nProposition 25 and subsequently, as needed, were accurate to several\nsignificant figures. All three derivations, which are\nmathematically demanding, were successful in obtaining agreement with\nthe values of the inequalities obtained from observation, especially so\nthe derivation for the recession of the lunar nodes, for which he\nachieves agreement with the known value to better than 98\npercent. (Newton must have been mystified by the failure of his\nseemingly parallel derivation of the 9 year precession of the line of\napsides to achieve better than 50 percent agreement.)\n\n\nThe Scholium following Proposition 35 opens with the explanation for\nthe preceding efforts on the lunar inequalities: \u201cI wished to show by\nthese computations of the lunar motions that the lunar motions can be\ncomputed from their causes by the theory of gravity\u201d\n[P, 869]. Newton never found a way of deriving\nthe precession of the lunar apogee from the theory of gravity, and\nconsequently he never succeeded with a complete, gravity-derived\naccount of the lunar\n orbit.[53]\nThe mathematical treatment of the three\nlunar inequalities nevertheless did provide added support for his\ntheory of gravity. It also introduced the idea of attacking the\nproblem of the true orbit in a sequence of successive approximations by\ncalculating perturbations in motion in an assumed orbit caused by the\ngravitational action of the Sun. This was not only an entirely\nnew approach to the then unsolved problem of simply describing the\nmotion of the Moon, an approach that proceeded from the physical cause\nto the motion; it was also the beginnings of the perturbational\napproach that dominated all of celestial mechanics from the middle of\nthe eighteenth century until late in the\n twentieth.[54]\nAs difficult as\nPropositions 25 through 35 were for readers at the time \u2014 and still\nare for readers now \u2014 they crucially promoted the further research on\nthe complicated orbital motions that ultimately supplied overwhelming\nsupport for Newton's theory of gravity.\n\n\nIt was a real breakthrough when Newton discovered that the\ngravitational forces of the Sun and Moon acting on an oblately\nspheroidal Earth would produce a wobble of the Earth that, at least\nqualitatively, could account for the precession of the Equinoxes.  No\nphysical explanation for this phenomenon had been proposed\nbefore. Newton faced a problem, however, in trying to carry out a\nquantitative derivation of the precession: he knew the magnitude of\nthe gravitational action of the Sun on the Earth but not that of the\nMoon, for he could not obtain the mass of the Moon in the way he had\nfor the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn insofar as no bodies orbit the Moon.\nPropositions 36 and 37 endeavor to infer the force of the Moon on the\nEarth from the difference in the heights of the tides when the Sun and\nMoon are in conjunction and in opposition. In the first edition Newton\nmanaged to derive a value for the rate of the precession in good\nagreement with the known value, but during the quarter century between\nthe first and second editions he concluded that the value he had used\nfor the Moon's force (6 and 1/3 times the Sun's force) was much too\nlarge. The derivation of the precession was therefore extensively\nrevised in the second edition, using a new value for the Moon's force\n(4.4815 times the Sun's force, still more than a factor of 2 greater\nthan the correct value). In all editions the derivation in Proposition\n39 treated the wobble not directly as the motion of a rigid body, but\nby analogy with the motion of the lunar nodes. By the standards of our\npresent physics, no part of Book 3 is further off-base than Newton's\nsolution for the precession. The phenomenon, however, subsequently\nprovided important evidence for Newton's theory of gravity when\nd'Alembert in 1749 carried out a successful derivation based on rigid\nbody motion and a correct value of the Moon's force derived from the\nthen recently discovered phenomenon of the nutation of the Earth.\n\n\nNewton's account of the tides in Propositions 24, 36, and 37 was\nmuch heralded not only at the time, but still today. He is\nnevertheless receiving more credit for this than he is due. He\ndid identify solar and lunar gravity as the forces driving the tides,\nbut this is all he did. He ignored the rotation of the Earth, and\nworse he considered only the radial component of the solar and lunar\ngravitational forces in these three propositions. In fact, the\nradial component of these forces has a very small effect compared with\nthe transradial component, that is, the component perpendicular to the\nradial component. All of this became clear in the 1770s when\nLaplace developed the mathematical theory of tidal motion from which all\nsubsequent work has proceeded.\n\n\nBook 3 ends with a revolutionary analysis of comet trajectories that\noccupies roughly one-third of the total length of the Book in all three\neditions. This analysis was slow in coming. As late as June\n1686, Newton wrote: \u201cthe third [book] wants the Theory of Comets\u201d\n[C, II, 437]. What made the problem difficult,\nas compared to planet trajectories, was the need to work from a small\nnumber of imprecise one-shot observations made from a moving\nEarth. The method presented in the Principia fits a\nparabola iteratively to the observations, employing novel\nfinite-difference methods that Newton later expanded into a full tract\nin mathematics, \u201cMethodis Differentialis.\u201d The method presupposes\nthe theory of gravity first in opting for a parabola and second in\nassuming that the inverse-square centripetal forces known from the\nplanets act on comets along their entire trajectory. The text\nnotes that the trajectories may well be ellipses, but the period of\nreturn in that case would be the best way of determining the\nellipse. (The parabola approximates the high-curvature end of\nellipses with high eccentricity.) The proposal that comets may\nreturn was novel, but even more revolutionary at the time was the claim\nthat they button-hook around the Sun, implying that what had sometimes\nin the past been taken for two distinct comets were really one comet\nbefore and after perihelion.\n\n\nIn the first edition the method was applied only to the comet of\n1680-81. The results are presented in a one-foot long diagram on\nthe only fold-out page in the edition. Nothing like this diagram,\nshown in Figure 3, had ever appeared in print before. The\ndiagram continued to appear in the next two editions, though in reduced\nform not requiring a fold-out in the third. In the second edition\nthe method was refined and applied as well to the comets of 1664-65,\n1683, and 1682 reflecting research Halley had carried out and published\nin his Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis of 1705. The comet\nof 1682, now known as Halley's comet, was singled out as being\nsufficiently similar in trajectory to the comet of 1607 to warrant the\nproposal that it returns every 75 years.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 \n\n\nAdded in the third edition was the retrograde comet of 1723, for which\nBradley had supplied comparatively accurate observations and the\nmethod correspondingly displayed its most impressive success, with no\ndiscrepancies between the calculated and observed positions exceeding\n1 minute of arc in either longitude or latitude. This suggested that\nthe more exacting the observations entering into the calculation, the\nmore accurate was the method.\n\n\nBecause Newton's theory of comet trajectories depended only on that\npart of the theory of gravity that was least controversial \u2014\ninverse-square centripetal accelerations everywhere around the Sun\n\u2014 it did not provoke much philosophical resistance. The success\nof the method provided evidence that these centripetal forces act\nequally on comets, contrary to Hooke's proposal in his Cometa\nof 1678 that comets must consist of a fundamentally different kind of\nmaterial from the planets insofar as they do not respond to the forces\ndirected toward the Sun in the same way. The success of the method\nalso provided strong evidence that inverse-square forces toward the\nSun hold throughout the space surrounding it, for not only do comets\ntraverse the spaces between the planet orbits, but also their\ntrajectories, in contrast to those of the then known planets, are\noften highly inclined with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Most\nof all, however, the success of the method provided the most\ncompelling evidence against not only Cartesian vortices, but all\ntheories claiming that the planets are carried around the Sun by fluid\nvortices. Corollary 3 to Proposition 39 in all three editions\nsummarizes the argument:\n\n\nHence also it is manifest that the heavens are lacking in\nresistance. For the comets, following paths that are oblique and\nsometimes contrary to the course of the planets, move in all directions\nvery freely and preserve their motions for a very long time even when\nthese are contrary to the course of planets. [P,\n895].\n\n\nThis was the argument that convinced Huygens when he read the first\nedition, and it became all the more compelling thereafter as the method\nwas so successful with further\n comets.[55]\n\n\nThe added evidence supplied by the theory of comets highlights a\nsometimes overlooked aspect of Book 3. The development of\nevidence for the theory of gravity in it does not end with the\n\u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of universal gravity at the beginning, but\ncontinues all the way through the Book. During the eighteenth\ncentury attention focused overwhelmingly on the evidence supplied by\nNewton's theory of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface\ngravity, the theory of the tides, the quantitative derivations of\nselect lunar inequalities, the derivation of the precession of the\nequinoxes, and the theory of comets. This suggests that, both\nthen and now, the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity should not be read\nin isolation from the rest of Book 3, but instead the entire Book\nshould be seen as offering a sustained evidential argument for the\ntheory. Read this way in the context of the rest of the Book, the\n\u201cdeduction\u201d is most appropriately viewed as intended to establish\nuniversal gravity, but only provisionally, as a theory on which further\nresearch is to be predicated, research that will continue to bring\nevidence to bear on the theory.\n",
