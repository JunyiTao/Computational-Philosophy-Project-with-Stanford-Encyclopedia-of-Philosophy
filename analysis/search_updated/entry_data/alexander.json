    "preamble": "\n\nAustralian-born philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938) was a\nprominent figure in early twentieth-century British philosophy. He is\nbest known for advancing \u201cBritish Emergentism\u201d, a movement\nthat held mind \u201cemerges\u201d from matter. Alexander rejected\nidealism, and accordingly can be labelled a \u201cnew\nrealist\u201d alongside the likes of Bertrand Russell; however,\nunlike other new realists, Alexander maintained close ties with\nBritish idealism throughout his career, and his ontology arguably\nbears similarities to the Absolute Idealism of F. H.\nBradley. Alexander\u2019s mature metaphysical system is set out in\nhis greatest work Space, Time, and Deity (1920). Alexander\nconceives the world as a hierarchy of levels: space and time sit at\nthe lowest level, and through a process of emergence give rise to the\nlevels of matter, life, mind, and deity. These levels are pervaded by\n\u201ccategorial\u201d features of reality, such as substance,\nuniversals, and causality. Although Alexander is primarily known as a\nmetaphysician, he wrote extensively on many other philosophical\ntopics, including the history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and\nthe philosophy of religion. Alexander spent most of his professional\ncareer at the University of Manchester, where he supported various\nmoves in education and feminism. On his death, Alexander left his\nphilosophical papers and correspondence to the John Rylands Library at\nManchester, and this collection constitutes an important philosophic\narchive of the period.\n\nAlexander\u2019s work was widely celebrated during his lifetime. J. H.\nMuirhead (1939: 3) wrote that, after Bradley\u2019s death in 1924,\nAlexander was \u201cthe leading figure in British philosophy, and whom\nall schools, whatever their differences, were delighted to\nhonour as their chief\u201d. John Laird (1939: 61\u20135)\ndescribed Space, Time, and Deity as \u201cthe boldest\nadventure in detailed speculative metaphysics\u201d since\nHobbes. Although he never founded a school of philosophy,\nAlexander is credited with having an influence on figures as diverse\nas new realists Laird, C. D. Broad, and Edwin B. Holt; the\nprocess philosopher A. N. Whitehead; John Anderson, \u201cfather\nof Australian philosophy\u201d, and his school at Sydney; British\nidealists May Sinclair and Hilda Oakeley; and philosopher of\nhistory R. G. Collingwood. A number of studies were produced on\nAlexander\u2019s work in the mid-twentieth century, but it then saw a\nperiod of neglect. Over the last decade or so, interest has increased,\nas indicated by Fisher\u2019s (2021) collection Marking the\nCentenary of Samuel Alexander\u2019s Space, Time and Deity.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nAlexander was born in Sydney on 6 January 1859, to a Jewish family. He\nwas the third son of Samuel Alexander, a British emigrant and saddler.\nAlexander\u2019s father died a few weeks after his birth, and five\nyears later the remaining family moved to Melbourne. Alexander was\nhome-educated by tutors before entering Wesley College in 1871.\nAlexander entered the University of Melbourne in 1875, and\nsubsequently won awards in arts, sciences, languages and natural\nphilosophy. In 1877, Alexander sailed for England, in an attempt to\nwin a scholarship at Oxbridge. He successfully obtained a scholarship\nat Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to win a First in 1881. The\nfollowing year, Alexander was awarded a Fellowship at Lincoln College,\nOxford.\n\nAt this time, the Oxford philosophical scene was dominated by British\nidealism, and Alexander formed lifelong ties with the Absolute\nidealists F. H. Bradley, A. C. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. This\nidealist influence is evident in Alexander\u2019s earliest works, on\nHegel and moral progress. Arguably, it is also evident in his later\nworks on metaphysics too. As a student, Alexander also read\nPlato\u2014under the tutelage of the idealist Benjamin\nJowett\u2014and Hegel.\n\nAlthough Alexander remained largely UK-based, in 1882\nhe travelled to Germany for a year, spending at least some of\nthis time at the University of Berlin, where he became familiar with\nthe physiological psychology of Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1890 he\ntravelled to Freiburg, Germany, to spend roughly another year working\nin Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg\u2019s new psychological laboratory.\n\nIn 1893, Alexander accepted a Professorship at the University of\nManchester. He took an active part in the university life there, and\nstrongly supported feminism. Alexander remained at Manchester for the\nrest of his life, and in 1902 he brought various family members\nover\u2014including his mother and three of his siblings\u2014from\nAustralia to Manchester. He did not marry. Although Alexander never\nreturned to Australia he maintained a correspondence with several\nAustralian philosophers, including the Scottish-born John\nAnderson.\n\nAs Alexander developed his anti-idealist views, he published on\nnaturalism and realism. He corresponded at length with fellow British\nemergentists C. Lloyd Morgan and C. D. Broad on psychology and\nmetaphysics. Whilst he rejected idealism, he also continued to\ncorrespond with F. H. Bradley and Bosanquet. During the War, Alexander\ncanvassed for recruits, and assisted Belgian refugees.\n\nInterest in Alexander\u2019s work grew as he became President of\nthe Aristotelian Society from 1908\u20131911 (he\nbecame President again, from 1936\u20131937). He was invited to\ndeliver the Gifford lectures during the war years 1917 and 1918.\nThese were called \u2018Space, time, and deity\u2019 and would form the basis of\nhis (1920) Space, Time, and Deity. Laird reports\nthat, after the war, Alexander struggled with writing its two volumes:\n\u201cHe was overwhelmed by a sense of his littleness in comparison\nwith the task to which he was tied\u201d (Laird 1939: 61).\nNonetheless, Space, Time, and Deity was finally\nfinished, assuring Alexander\u2019s place within the British philosophical\nlandscape. It was praised by new realists and idealists alike. As\nJohn Passmore puts it:\n\n\n\u2026even when he [Alexander] broke with the Idealists, they\ncontinued to speak of him with a respect they rarely showed to the New\nRealists\u2014although this charity did not survive the bleakness of\nCambridge, where McTaggart, forgetting his own blackened pots,\ncomplained of Space, Time, and Deity that \u201cin every\nchapter we come across some view which no philosopher, except\nProfessor Alexander, has ever maintained\u201d. It would be inhuman\nto expect the arch-enemy of Time to praise its arch-prophet. (Passmore\n1957: 268)\n\n\nBleakness of Cambridge aside, Alexander received many honours during\nhis lifetime. These include his election as a Fellow of the British\nAcademy in 1913, an honorary D.Litt from Oxford in 1924, an honorary\nLitt.D from the University of Liverpool in 1925, and another from the\nUniversity of Cambridge in 1934. In 1923, Alexander retired from\nManchester. In a speech, he described how proud and happy he was\nduring his time as a professor there, \u201cduring which I tried to\ndo my part\u201d (Alexander, cited in Laird 1939: 71).\n\nAlexander\u2019s retirement did not stem the tide of his output.\nHaving completed Space, Time, and Deity, Alexander continued\nto produce a stream of articles as prolific as it was diverse. He\nwrote several pieces comparing his metaphysics to that of Spinoza, and\nAlexander took pride\u2014rooted partly in their shared Jewish\nheritage\u2014in the deep similarity he perceived there. Alexander\nalso wrote on the nature of art, history, Moliere, Pascal, theology,\nand Jane Austen. Alexander was a lifelong fan of Austen, and\nparticularly loved Persuasion. His friend and colleague, J.\nH. Muirhead, suggested that Alexander\u2019s love of literature may\nhave resulted from partial deafness, which made it difficult for\nhim to appreciate music.\n\nUltimately, Alexander turned his philosophic attention away from\nmetaphysics to art and value. Lord Listowel describes\nAlexander\u2019s move towards aesthetics:\n\n\nBut why, of the many unsailed seas he must have been tempted to chart,\ndid his insatiable curiosity launch him on a last voyage into the\nrough waters of aesthetic theory? There is no certain answer to this\nquestion. What we do know is that the third person of the hallowed\ntrinity whose members are Truth, Goodness, and Beauty had hitherto\nbeen sadly neglected as compared with the first two, and that a\ntreatise on aesthetics was urgently required as the coping stone of a\nneatly finished philosophical system. Yet it would be a grievous error\nto suppose that his fondness for the subject was due solely or even\nmainly to systematic grounds. Art, in its manifold shapes, attracted\nhim irresistibly\u2026 [he] wrote and talked about Art because he\nreally loved the pictures, statues, mansions, poems, novels, and plays\nthat are its concrete manifestations. (Listowel 1939: 181)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s full system of aesthetics can be found in his final\nmonograph, Beauty and Other Forms of Value (1933).\n\nIn his late years, Alexander continued to publish, but Laird reports\nthat Alexander was greatly troubled from the 1930s by the suffering of\nJewish refugees; Alexander did all he could to help with pen and purse\n(Laird 1939: 94). Alexander died on 13 September 1938, and his ashes\nlie in the Manchester Southern Cemetery. He bequeathed the majority of\nhis estate, and his philosophical papers, to the University of\nManchester. A bust of Alexander, by the artist Epstein, stands in the\nUniversity of Manchester\u2019s Samuel Alexander Building (formerly\nknown as the Hall of the Arts Building). Alexander reportedly said\nthat he would be happy to have Erravit cum Spinoza engraved\non his funeral urn; Muirhead suggested that instead he should have\nUt alter Spinoza\n philosophatus[1]\n (Muirhead 1939: 14).\n\nA biography of Alexander can be found in Laird\u2019s (1939) memoir;\nsee also Muirhead (1939) and G. F. Stout (1940). \n2. Early Writings\n2.1 History of Philosophy: Hegel and Locke\n\nAlexander\u2019s first publication, \u201cHegel\u2019s Conception\nof Nature\u201d (1886), reveals Alexander\u2019s philosophic\nupbringing in Oxford\u2019s British Hegelian enclave. Alexander aims to set\nout Hegel\u2019s conception of nature, \u201cso fantastic and\nso poetical that it may often be thought not to be\nserious\u201d, as clearly as possible. He also aims to show\nwhere it agrees with, and diverges from, contemporary science. The\narticle explains that science leads to a philosophy of nature\nthrough observation\u2014for example, transforming seemingly isolated\nindividuals into universals by discovering their general\ncharacter\u2014and the discovery of laws. Alexander also compares\nHegel\u2019s account to contemporary theories of evolution, and\nargues there is a \u201cgreat likeness\u201d (Alexander 1886: 518).\nArguably, some of the positions that Alexander attributes to Hegel are\nsimilar to his own mature views; for example, Alexander reads Hegel as\nholding that space and time are \u201cin the world\u201d as much as\nmatter (Alexander 1886: 506).\n\nAlexander\u2019s early monograph Locke (1908) discusses\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay on ethics, politics, and\nreligion. This short book reveals Alexander\u2019s admiration\nfor Locke, and Lockean empiricism. Whilst this work is mainly of\nscholarly interest, Alexander spends one chapter \u201cObservations\non the Essay\u201d critiquing Locke, and here Alexander\nreveals the bent of his own early views. For example, Alexander\ncomplains that Locke might have gone further had he applied his\nobservations regarding the continuity of mental experience to\nsubstance (Alexander 1908: 52). This is suggestive, given that one of\nAlexander\u2019s later key claims concerning spacetime\u2014the\nstuff of substances\u2014is that it is continuous.\n2.2 Evolutionary Ethics\n\nAlexander\u2019s first monograph, Moral Order and\nProgress (1889), defends evolutionary ethics, the\nnaturalist thesis that human morality is a product of biological\nevolution. The monograph is based on a dissertation written by\nAlexander at Oxford, for which he won the 1887 T. H. Green Moral\nPhilosophy Prize. In the preface, Alexander writes,\n\n\nI am proud to have my work connected, however indirectly, with the\nname of T. H. Green; and I feel this all the more because, though, as\nwill be obvious, my obligations to him are very great, I have not\nscrupled to express my present dissent from his fundamental\nprinciples. (vii)\n\n\nThe preface also reveals the strong idealist backdrop against which\nAlexander\u2019s work is set: the monograph is dedicated to A. C.\nBradley, and in the preface Alexander personally thanks D. G. Ritchie,\nWilliam Wallace, R. L. Nettleship, and J. S. Haldane. Alexander adds\nthat he owes a special debt of gratitude to F. H. Bradley, who went\nthrough the essay with him (Alexander 1889: ix). Alexander continued\nto exchange philosophic ideas with many of these idealists throughout\ntheir lives.\n\nAlexander opens the monograph by stating that the proper business of\nethics is the study of moral judgements, such as \u201cIt is wrong to\nlie\u201d. Alexander sets out to discover the nature of morality,\nasking what these judgements actually express (Alexander 1889:\n1\u20133). He does so by examining a selection of \u201cworking\nconceptions\u201d in ethics\u2014including right, wrong, and\nduty\u2014and asking what they correspond to. In the same way that\nthe working conceptions of physics\u2014including energy, matter and\nmotion\u2014are ordered according to a \u201cnatural\ncoherence\u201d, Alexander aims to order ethical conceptions.\nAlexander concludes that these working conceptions correspond to ways\nof maintaining equilibrium in society. For example, ideas of good or\nright imply nothing more than \u201can adjustment of parts in an\norderly whole\u201d: the equilibrium of different persons in\nsociety.\n\n\n[T]he predicate \u2018good\u2019 applied to an action\u2026 means\nthat the act is one by which the agent seeks to perform the function\nrequired of him by his position in society. (Alexander 1889: 113)\n\n\nAlexander takes this thesis to be the common ground of at least two\ncurrent rival ethical theories:\n\n\nNow nothing is more striking at the present time than the convergence\nof the main opposing ethical theories, at any rate, in our own\ncountry\u2014on the one hand, the traditional English mode of\nthought, which advancing through utilitarianism has ended in the\nso-called evolutionary ethics; and on the other, the idealistic\nmovement which is associated with the German philosophy derived from\nKant\u2026 Both these views recognise that kind of proportion\nbetween the individual and his society, or between him and the law,\nwhich is expressed under the phrase, organic connection. (Alexander\n1889: 5\u20136)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s perception of progress in ethical theory, towards\nthis correct end point, is Hegelian in style.\n\nAlexander\u2019s ethical system is a kind of evolutionary ethics,\nakin to that of Leslie Stephen. By applying evolution to\nethics, Alexander explains that one can mean either the mere\nintegration of the biological into the ethical sphere, or treating\nmorals as one part of a comprehensive view of the universe, in which a\nsteady development from the lower to the higher can be observed, a\ndevelopment which follows the law of the survival of the fittest\n(Alexander 1889: 14). Alexander, of course, means both. He emphasises\nthat while his ethical system, based on the organic nature of society,\nis due in part to the influence of the biological sciences, it would\nbe an \u201centire misapprehension\u201d to think that it were\nentirely due to this influence; his views are also the result of\nprogress in ethics and politics (Alexander 1889: 7\u20138).\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite the spectre of Hegelian idealism\nhovering in the background of this work, Alexander firmly resists\nidealism\u2019s tendency towards monism, the view that the universe is\nin some sense One:\n\n\n[T]he conception of a common good is apt to suggest an absolute\nidentity of good\u2026 in greater or less degree all forms of\nso-called Monism, which hold that in the good act the individual is at\none with others, and with the Universal Being, are victims of the\nmisconception. (Alexander 1889: 174)\n\n\nIn other words, Alexander is arguing that just because he is putting\nforward one conception of goodness\u2014organic connection within\nsociety\u2014we should not accept that individuals within society are\nnot individuals.\n3. Metaphysics and Related Views\n3.1 Realism and Compresence\n\nAlthough Alexander may have defended realism from his\nearliest works, his mature realism can be found in a battery of later\npapers, published in quick succession: including his\n1909\u201310, 1912a, 1912b and 1914. These papers advance theses\nthat Alexander would expand on in Space, Time, and Deity\n(1920).\n\nIn \u201cThe Basis of Realism\u201d (1914), Alexander rejects\nidealism in favour of realism. He writes that the \u201ctemper\u201d\nof realism is to de-anthropomorphise: to put man and mind in their\nproper places in the world of things. Whilst mind is properly\nunderstood as part of nature, this does not diminish its value\n(Alexander 1914: 279\u201380). For Alexander, realism is thus\nnaturalistic. This paper is an expansion of Alexander\u2019s less\nrigorous (1909\u201310), where he compares the new conception of mind\nas a mere part of the universe\u2014as opposed to being at the centre\nof the universe\u2014to the move from geocentrism to\nheliocentrism.\n\nA key part of Alexander\u2019s view is that minds exist in the world\nalongside other things. Minds are \u201ccompresent\u201d with other\nobjects in the world, such as tables and mountains. In fact, all\nexistents are compresent with each other:\n\n\nThere is nothing peculiar in the relation itself between mind and its\nobjects; what is peculiar in the situation is the character of one of\nthe terms, its being mind or consciousness. The relation is one of\ncompresence. But there is compresence between two physical things. The\nrelation of mind and object is comparable to that between table and\nfloor. (Alexander 1914: 288)\n\n\nAccording to Alexander, we perceive the world directly: we do not\nperceive representations or ideas of tables, but the tables themselves\n(or aspects of the tables). We are conscious of our\nperceptual process, a consciousness he labels\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d. Any direct theory of perception must account\nfor error. If we perceive the world directly, how do we make\nmistakes about it? Alexander\u2019s answer is that we do not perceive\nthe world incorrectly, but we can incorrectly apply partial\nperceptions to wholes. For example, we may correctly perceive a table\nas having a flat edge, but incorrectly apply that perception to\nthe table as a whole.\n\nAlexander also argues here that minds emerge from lower-level living\norganisms, and are no less real for it:\n\n\n[M]ind, though descended on its physical side from lower forms of\nexistence, is, when it comes, a new quality in the world, and no more\nceases to be original because in certain respects it is resoluble into\nphysical motions, than colour disappears because it is resoluble into\nvibrations. (Alexander 1914: 304)\n\n\nThe biology that informed Alexander\u2019s early (1889) work on\nethics survives in his account of mind: mind emerges in the world\nthrough evolution. This theory of \u201cemergent evolution\u201d is\nakin to that advanced by C. Lloyd Morgan; Alexander later references\nMorgan\u2019s Instinct and Experience (1912). Alexander\nadds here that the lowest level of existence is space and\ntime\u2014that they are \u201cthe foundation of all\nreality\u201d\u2014and he greatly expands on this view in his book\n(1920).\n\nOn Alexander\u2019s realism, including the motivations underlying\nit and the question of whether realism can be found in his\nearliest work, see Weinstein (1984), Fisher (2017; 2021b),\nand Thomas (2021). \n3.2 Space, Time, and Deity\n\nThis difficult two-volume work sets out Alexander\u2019s grand\nmetaphysical picture, a sweeping system that offers a\ncosmogony, an explanation of how the world came to be in its\ncurrent state; and a hierarchical ontology based on emergence\nthat attempts to account for matter, life, mind, value, and deity.\nAlexander does not argue for this picture. Rather, he intends that his\npicture should provide a description of the world. This is in line\nwith his general methodology.\n\n\nPhilosophy proceeds by description; it only uses argument in order to\nhelp you to see the facts, just as a botanist uses a microscope.\n(Alexander 1921b: 423)\n\n\nThe idea is that Space, Time, and Deity offers a description\nof the world that best fits the facts.\n\nThe first chapter of Space, Time, and Deity opens with\nAlexander\u2019s proclamation that all the vital problems of\nphilosophy depend on space and time (Alexander 1920i: 35). Alexander\nconceives space and time as the stuff out of which all things are\nmade: space and time are real and concrete, and out of them emerge\nmatter, life, and so on. Space and time are unified in a\nfour-dimensional manifold, spacetime. This single vast entity does not\nmove but contains all motions within itself, and so Alexander labels\nit \u201cMotion\u201d. In this respect, Alexander\u2019s spacetime\nbears some resemblance to F. H. Bradley\u2019s (1893) Absolute:\nneither Motion nor the Absolute move or exist in time, but they both\ncontain motion and time within themselves.\n\nAlexander presents a metaphysical argument for the unity of space and\ntime, arguing they are merely distinguishable aspects of Motion. He\nargues that space and time must be unified because, when abstracted\naway from each other, it becomes clear that they could not exist\nindependently. Time would become a mere \u201cnow\u201d, incapable\nof succession; and space would become a mere \u201cblank\u201d,\nwithout distinguishable elements (Alexander 1920i: 47). Motion is both\nsuccessive and boasts distinguishable elements - this is\nbecause it is the union of space and time. Alexander\u2019s\nmetaphysical argument for this union was severely criticised by\n Broad (1921a,b).[2]\n Alexander considered his account of spacetime to be in line with the\nphysics of his day. The following might be understood as an\nargument from physics for his position:\n\n\nOur purely metaphysical analysis of Space-Time on the basis of\nordinary experience is in essence and spirit identical with\nMinkowski\u2019s conception of an absolute world of four dimensions,\nof which the three-dimensional world of geometry omits the element of\ntime. (Alexander 1920i: 87)\n\n\nAlexander goes on to distinguish between the characters of empirical\nexistents that are variable\u2014such as life, redness or\nsweetness\u2014and those that are pervasive.\n\n\n[These pervasive qualities] belong in some form to all existents\nwhatever. Such are identity (numerical identity for example),\nsubstance, diversity, magnitude, even number\u2026 The pervasive\ncategories of existence are what are known from Kant\u2019s usage as\nthe categories of experience, and I shall call them, in distinction\nfrom the empirical ones or qualities, categorial characters.\n(Alexander 1920i: 184\u20135)\n\n\nCategorial qualities are the properties of spacetime, and this is why\nthe categories apply to all things within spacetime. This discussion\nbuilds on Alexander\u2019s \u201cThe Method of Metaphysics; and the\nCategories\u201d (1912). In a later paper, \u201cSome\nExplanations\u201d (1921b), which aims to answer critics\u2019\nworries, Alexander explains that the existence of the categories\nimplies the existence of something that contains them: spacetime.\n\n\n[F]or me the doctrine of the categories, taken along with the notion\nof S-T [spacetime], is central\u2026 What is \u201crelation\u201d\nin virtue of which duration is a whole of related successive moments?\nWhat does relation stand for in our experience? I answer that it\nalready implies S-T, and that until it receives its concrete\ninterpretation it is in metaphysics a word. (Alexander 1921b:\n411\u20132)\n\n\nThe idea is that, by supposing the existence of spacetime, we explain\nthe existence of relations (characteristics of reality that hold\nbetween all things). Similarly, the existence of spacetime explains\nthe existence of all other categories. For more on relations, see\nAlexander\u2019s (1921b).\n\nThe second volume of Space, Time, and Deity asks how\nspacetime is related to the various levels of existence within it:\nmatter, life, mind and deity. Alexander argues we should model the\nemergence of levels within spacetime on the emergence of mind from\nbody:\n\n\nEmpirical things are complexes of space-time with their qualities, and\nit is now my duty to attempt to show how the different orders of\nempirical existence are related to each other\u2026 [T]he nature of\nmind and its relation to body is a simpler problem in itself than the\nrelation of lower qualities of existence to their inferior basis; and\nfor myself it has afforded the clue to the interpretation of the lower\nlevels of existence. (Alexander 1920ii: 3)\n\n\nAnalogous to the way that Alexander takes mind to emerge from body,\nnew levels of being emerge from spacetime when the motions within\nspacetime become complex enough:\n\n\nEmpirical things or existents are\u2026 groupings within Space-Time,\nthat is, they are complexes of pure events or motions in various\ndegrees of complexity. Such finites have all the categorial\ncharacters, that is, all the fundamental features which flow from the\nnature of any space-time\u2026 [A]s in the course of Time new\ncomplexity of motions comes into existence, a new quality\nemerges\u2026 The case which we are using as a clue is the emergence\nof the quality of consciousness from a lower level of complexity which\nis vital [i.e., life]. (Alexander 1920ii: 45)\n\n\nAlexander has been criticised for explaining the emergence of\nqualities within spacetime by analogy with mind-body emergence, as the\nlatter kind of emergence is rarely taken to be as unproblematic as\nAlexander appears to conceive it. For more on this, see for example\nEmmet (1950).\n\nAccording to Alexander, the emergence of new levels of being within\nspacetime is driven by a \u201cnisus\u201d, a striving or felt push\ntowards some end:\n\n\nThere is a nisus in Space-Time which, as it has borne its creatures\nforward through matter and life to mind, will bear them forward to\nsome higher level of existence. (Alexander 1920ii: 346)\n\n\nThis means that the emergence of qualities in spacetime is not merely\na process, it is a progress. Exactly what the nisus is has\ndivided\n commentators.[3]\n but however it is best understood, it pushes the emergence of new\nqualities within spacetime, and this includes the push towards\ndeity.\n\nThe second volume of Space, Time, and Deity also contains a\nrelatively brief discussion of beauty, and other forms of value.\nAlexander hugely expands on this account in his 1933 monograph;\n see Section 4.2 below.\n\nAlexander engaged in extended correspondence on Space, Time, and\nDeity: his letters with F. H. Bradley, C. D. Broad, and C.\nLloyd Morgan are particularly important. Some of the Bradley\ncorrespondence can be found in Bradley\u2019s (1999) Collected\nWorks. Other letters can be found in Samuel Alexander\nPapers, John Rylands Library, Manchester.\n\nSecondary literature on Alexander\u2019s spacetime metaphysics\nincludes Brettschneider (1964), Broad (1921a,b), Murphy\u2019s\n(1927\u20131928) series, Emmet (1950), Thomas (2013), Fisher (2015),\nand Rush (2021). Schaffer\u2019s (2009) argues for the identification\nof spacetime with matter, and traces this line of thought to\nAlexander. Secondary literature on Alexander\u2019s account of\nmind-body emergence include classic critiques from Broad (1921a,b),\nCalkins (1923) and Emmet (1950). Stout (1922) discusses and rejects\nAlexander\u2019s theory of perception. There has been more recent\nwork on Alexander\u2019s account of emergence in general; see\nMcLaughlin (1992), Gillet (2006), and O\u2019Connor and Wong\n(2012).\n3.3 Philosophy of Religion\n\nOne of the optimistic conclusions of Space, Time, and Deity\nis that, in the future, deity will emerge as a quality of the universe\nas a whole. This deity-world emergence is akin to mind-body emergence.\nIn the following passage, Alexander explains that we should not\nidentity God with spacetime. Instead, the spacetime system is in the\nprocess of \u201cengendering\u201d God:\n\n\nThe universe, though it can be expressed without remainder in terms of\nSpace and Time, is not merely spatio-temporal. It exhibits materiality\nand life and mind. It compels us to forecast the next empirical\nquality of deity. On the one hand, we have the totality of the world,\nwhich in the end is spatio-temporal; on the other the quality of deity\nengendered or rather being engendered, within that whole. These two\nfeatures are united in the conception of the whole world as expressing\nitself in the character of deity, and it is this and not bare\nSpace-Time which for speculation is the ideal conception of God.\n(Alexander 1920ii: 353\u20134)\n\n\nFor Alexander, God is the whole world possessing the quality of deity\n(Alexander 1920ii: 353). However, the \u201cwhole world\u201d does\nnot yet exist because Alexander\u2019s universe is one of process;\nthe universe is in progress towards becoming complete, and this is why\nAlexander claims the universe is in process towards deity. The whole\nworld, which will possess the quality of deity, does not yet exist,\nbut part of it does: \u201cAs an actual existent, God is the infinite\nworld with its nisus towards deity\u201d (Alexander 1920ii: 353). The\nquality of deity has not yet arrived\u2014and indeed, may never\narrive\u2014but God exists in the sense that part of his body, the\ngrowing world, does.\n\nA potential problem for Alexander is that God is frequently perceived\nas being atemporal. In contrast, on Alexander\u2019s system, God is\nboth spatial and temporal. Alexander recognises that this could be\nconsidered a problem, but argues that in fact it is an advantage. If\nGod does not \u201cprecede\u201d the world, but rather is the\nproduct of it, you can avoid one formulation of the problem of\nevil, on which God creates the world and allows suffering within it\n(Alexander 1920ii: 399).\n\n\nGod is then not responsible for the miseries endured in working out\nhis providence, but rather we are responsible for our acts. (Alexander\n1920ii: 400)\n\n\nA created deity makes our positions as free agents more important.\n\nAlexander\u2019s account of deity is explored further in his 1927\n\u201cTheism and Pantheism\u201d, reprinted in his\nPhilosophical and Literary Pieces (1939). This paper argues\nthat theology is a kind of science aiming to account for a\ncertain kind of experience: one\u2019s sense of the divine in the\nworld (Alexander 1939: 316). Alexander discusses a particular\nphilosophical problem facing theism, the question of whether\ntranscendence (i.e., being beyond the material world) and immanence\n(i.e., living within the world) can be combined in one being, as is\noften claimed of God. Alexander argues he can offer a solution: God\ncan be understood as being transcendent and immanent if he will emerge\nfrom the world:\n\n\nGod\u2026 is himself in the making, and his divine quality or deity\na stage in time beyond the human quality. And as the root and leaves\nand sap of the plant feed its flower, so the whole world, as so far\nunrolled in the process of time, flowers into deity\u2026\nGod\u2019s deity is thus the new quality of the universe which\nemerges in its forward movement in time. (Alexander 1939: 330)\n\n\nGod is transcendent in the sense that he is still in the making, and\nimmanent in the sense that he will bloom from the whole world.\n\nExtended discussions of Alexander\u2019s theism can be found in Titus\n(1933) and Thomas (2016). Brief discussions can be found in\nMcCarthy (1948) and Stiernotte (1954). Emergentist\ntheologies, holding that in some sense God will emerge\nfrom the universe, are currently enjoying a revival, and in this\ncontext Clayton (2004) discusses Alexander\u2019s system as a rival\nto his own.\n4. Late Writings\n4.1 History of Philosophy: Spinoza\n\nAfter the publication of Space, Time, and Deity, Alexander\nreportedly came across the system of Spinoza for the first time. In a\nlate series of papers, including Spinoza and Time\n(1921a) and \u201cLessons from Spinoza\u201d (1927), Alexander\nreconstructs his system as a \u201cgloss\u201d of Spinoza.\n\nAlexander argues that philosophy and physics has only just begun to\n\u201cTake time seriously\u201d and, had Spinoza been aware of\nthese developments, his ontology would ultimately have resembled\nAlexander\u2019s. Alexander particularly refers to the thesis that\nspace and time should be combined into the four dimensional manifold\nspacetime.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics argues there is only one substance, and\nthis substance is identical with God and nature. The substance has an\ninfinite number of attributes, including spatial extension, and it\nsupports an infinity of dependent modes. Alexander argues that his\nsystem is similar to Spinoza\u2019s except that he understands the\nsingle substance\u2014Motion\u2014to have only two attributes, space\nand time.\n\n\nIn our gloss upon Spinoza the ultimate reality is full of Time, not\ntimeless but essentially alive with Time, and the theatre of incessant\nchange. It is only timeless in the sense that taken as a whole it is\nnot particularised to any one moment of duration, but comprehends them\nall\u2026 Reality is Space-Time or motion itself, infinite or\nself-contained and having nothing outside itself. (Alexander 1921a:\n39)\n\n\nAlexander argues his gloss solves problems\nin Spinoza\u2019s original system. He also praises Spinoza for\nsuccessfully combining religious values and naturalism (Alexander\n1927: 14). Alexander concludes one of his pieces on this topic by\nsaying that he takes pride in the similarity between his system and\nSpinoza\u2019s (Alexander 1921a: 79). Alexander was corresponding at\nthis time with the Spinoza scholar Harold Joachim.\n\nThere is very little secondary literature on this aspect of\nAlexander\u2019s thought, although Thomas (2013) has argued Alexander\nis best understood through Spinoza.\n4.2 Art and Other Forms of Value\n\nAlexander\u2019s writing on art falls into two kinds. First, there\nare essays on literature and art. These are all reprinted in\nAlexander\u2019s (1939), and cover a wide range of\ntopics: from the art of Jane Austen, to the writings of Pascal,\nto the origin of the creative impulse. Second, there are the pieces\ncomprising Alexander\u2019s account of value. Alexander\u2019s early\ninterest in ethics\u2014exemplified in his first monograph\n(1889)\u2014survived in his later work as a preoccupation with the\nnature of value, albeit with a focus on the aesthetic value of beauty.\nAlexander\u2019s (1920) contained several chapters on the nature of\nvalue, and he goes on to supplement these with further papers on the\nsame theme. These include \u201cNaturalism and Value\u201d, and\n\u201cValue\u201d, both reprinted in Alexander\u2019s\nPhilosophical and Literary Pieces (1939); and \u201cMorality\nas An Art\u201d (1928). These papers culminate in another monograph,\nBeauty and Other Forms of Value\n(1933), Alexander\u2019s most important work on the topic. His\nwritings on value are of greater philosophic interest than those on\nliterature and art.\n\nThe views that Alexander expresses in \u201cMorality as An Art\u201d\nprovide a useful introduction to his full account. In this paper,\nAlexander argues we can fruitfully understand morality by comparing it\nwith fine art. He argues that, just as the value of beauty found in\nart is a human construction, so are moral values:\n\n\nFor it is the most obvious feature of fine art that it is a human\nconstruction. But it is not so evident that truth and morality are as\nmuch constructions of ours as beauty is\u2026 I am here to plead the\nopposite doctrine. The highest so-called values, truth, beauty, and\ngoodness, are all of them human inventions, and the valuable is what\nsatisfies certain human instincts or impulses. (Alexander 1928:\n143)\n\n\nAn objection to this view is that beauty is not constructed; we might\nfind it in a natural landscape, for example. Alexander replies to this\nthat landscapes and other natural phenomena are rendered beautiful by\nthe parts that we pick out, akin to a photographer composing a\npicture. As such, the beauty of nature is composed by us (Alexander\n1928:149). This entails that there is no difference in kind between\nnatural beauty and art; for more on this, see Alexander\u2019s\n\u201cArt and the Material\u201d (reprinted in Alexander 1939).\n\nAlexander argues we construct values in response to certain needs. For\nexample, beauty satisfies the impulse of constructiveness in humans.\nIn \u201cValue\u201d, Alexander connects human art to the dam\nbuilding of beavers (Alexander 1939: 296). Analogously, morality\nsatisfies the impulse of gregariousness or sociality in humans.\n\n\n[I]t is humanized out of the purely animal sociality\u2026 which we\nfind in animals that live in herds like wild dogs, or form societies\nlike bees. (Alexander 1928: 150)\n\n\nBeauty and other forms of Value (1933) expands on this\naccount. Alexander perceives his naturalistic account of value to be\nsimilar to that offered by Spinoza. In \u201cNaturalism and\nValue\u201d, Alexander tells us that Spinoza\u2019s is the\n\u201ctrue\u201d naturalism: everything is extension, including\nvalue, and yet everything is still divine (Alexander 1939: 279).\n\nBuilding on the many smaller pieces that preceded it, Beauty and\nOther Forms of Value provides a full naturalist account of value.\nAlexander\u2019s approach is to discuss the supreme values in\nturn, beginning with beauty, and moving on to truth and goodnes.\nHe continues down to lesser values. He aims to explain not just\nwhat values are, but also how they came to be.\n\nAlexander argues that anything can have value if it matters to a\nthing. In this sense, food is valuable to an animal, and moisture is\nvaluable to a plant. However, the \u201csupreme\u201d\nvalues\u2014beauty, goodness and truth\u2014can be distinguished\nfrom others because they are the only values that are valuable in\nthemselves, for their own sake:\n\n\nWhen we come to the highest values, the beautiful, the true and the\ngood, these in one respect are like wheat and apples: they are objects\nof a certain constitution\u2014statues and sonatas, landscapes,\ngenerous deeds, chemistry. Their pre-eminence as values is that they\nhave no being apart from their value. That is because they are not\nmerely found, like apples, and their value, like the value of apples\nfor food, then discovered, but are made to have value, come into\nexistence along with their value. (Alexander 1933: 293)\n\n\nThe claim that these values come into existence along with their value\nis of course referring to Alexander\u2019s thesis, also given in\nhis Beauty and other forms of Value (1933), that the\nsupreme values are human inventions.\n\nAs we saw above, Alexander argues that humans construct values in\nresponse to certain needs or instincts. The final part of Beauty\nand Other Forms of Value identifies the animal origin of our\nsupreme values. For example, there is an analogy to be drawn between\nthe social impulse in humans and in bees. \u201cNaturalism and\nValue\u201d explains that in the same way that bees\u2019\ninstinct for finding honey once seemed to be\n\u201cmagical\u201d and yet has been explained by biology in\nnaturalistic terms, similarly values appear to be magical and yet can\nbe explained naturally (Alexander 1939: 282). He goes on to argue that\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution plays an important role in the\ndevelopment of value:\n\n\n[T]he doctrine of natural selection may be described as the history of\nhow value makes its entry into the organic world. So far as it is a\nnecessary part of the process by which species are established, it is\nthe principle which constitutes the history of value, for it shows how\nthe mere interests of individual organisms come to be well-founded and\nto be values. (Alexander 1933: 287)\n\n\nThe idea is that, for animals, things that have value are usually\nthose that will further the survival of the species, such as food.\nAnimals whose interests do not help to maintain their existence\nsuccumb under the conditions of their existence, and \u201cleave the\nfield\u201d for others. In this way, natural selection provides a\nhistory of value. More on this can be found in Alexander\u2019s\n\u201cNaturalism and Value\u201d (reprinted in Alexander 1939). This\nintegration of the theory of evolution into Alexander\u2019s\naesthetics should come as no surprise to us, being as it is a theme in\nAlexander\u2019s larger work.\n\nAlexander\u2019s writings on art and value were well received in\ntheir day:\n\n\n[Alexander\u2019s] happy blending of Herbert Spencer\u2019s patient\nempiricism with the bolder systematic sweep of Bradley and the giant\nfigures of German idealism was nowhere more fruitful than in his\ntreatment of aesthetics. (Listowel 1939: 183)\n\n\nThe secondary literature includes Listowel (1939), Fox (1934),\nHooper (1950), and Innis (2017).\n4.3 The Historicity of Things\n\n\u201cThe Historicity of Things\u201d (1936) is one of\nAlexander\u2019s last papers. One reason it is valuable is\nthat it gives a concise overview of Alexander\u2019s spacetime\nmetaphysics in his own words. Another reason it is valuable is\nthat it tackles an unusual theme: the relationship between history and\nnature. Alexander argues that while some of the contributions to\nphilosophy from science are clear, it is less clear what philosophy\ncan learn from history (Alexander 1936: 12). Alexander argues that, as\ntime and motion belong to the most fundamental level of reality, all\nthat exists is \u201chistorical\u201d. As such, science begins with\nhistory:\n\n\nHistory can claim to be mistress of science, as much as mathematics,\nthough in a different sense. They stand for the two vital elements in\nevery science which cannot be separated, if they can be considered\nseparately, the constructive process by which we discover by our\nthought the order inherent in things, and the raw material\nitself\u2026 It must be remembered, however, of course, that\nhistorical science is but one of the sciences which arise\nfrom the facts and happenings of the world. (Alexander 1936: 24)\n\n\nAlexander\u2019s characterisation of history as having the whole\nworld as its subject matter is interesting not least because it proved\nso controversial. Both R. G. Collingwood and Hilda Oakeley, two\nphilosophers of history associated with British idealism, took strong\nissue with Alexander\u2019s description; see Collingwood\u2019s\nreprinted Principles of History (1938 [1999: 56]) and\nOakeley\u2019s \u201cThe World as Memory and as History\u201d\n(1925\u20136).\n\nBoth Oakeley and Collingwood corresponded with Alexander, and what has\nsurvived of their correspondence can be found in the Samuel Alexander\nPapers at the John Rylands Library. The Alexander-Collingwood\ncorrespondence has been published in Kobayashi (2021), who also\nprovides discussion. \n5. Alexander\u2019s Legacy\n\nAlexander\u2019s work impacted a wide variety of thinkers, and he was\nespecially widely read from the 1910s to the 1930s. His work was\nused and referenced by the likes of British new realists Bertrand\nRussell, G. E. Moore, and G. F. Stout, John Laird, C. D. Broad;\nand by American realists Edwin B. Holt, and George P. Adams;\nfor a longer list, see Fisher (2021a). \n\nThe last decade has seen increasing scholarly interest in tracing\nAlexander\u2019s influence on other philosophers. For example, his work was\nalso picked up by John Anderson, who attended Alexander\u2019s\n1917\u20131918 Gifford lectures. Lines of thought stemming from\nAlexander can be found in Anderson\u2019s Australian student, D.M.\nArmstrong; and in American philosopher Donald C. Williams. On\nAlexander\u2019s influence on Anderson and Armstrong, see Gillett\n(2006), Fisher (2015), Cole (2018, \u00a71; \u00a75.2); and Weblin\n(2021). On Williams, see Fisher (2015) and Williams (2021).\nMetaphysician Dorothy Emmet\u2019s (2021) piece shows her work also\nowed a lot to Alexander.\n\nThe extent of Alexander\u2019s intellectual relationship with\nphilosopher of history R. G. Collingwood is only recently coming to be\nappreciated; see O\u2019Neill (2006), Connelly (2021), and Kobayashi\n(2021). Unusually for a realist, Alexander\u2019s work was also\npicked up by at least two British idealists, May Sinclair and Hilda\nOakeley; see Thomas (2015; 2019).\n",
