Put crudely, the core idea in this attack is that human\nexpertise is not based on the explicit, disembodied, mechanical\nmanipulation of symbolic information (such as formulae in some logic,\nor probabilities in some Bayesian network), and that AI\u2019s\nefforts to build machines with such expertise are doomed if based on\nthe symbolic paradigm. The genesis of the Dreyfusian attack was a\nbelief that the critique of (if you will) symbol-based philosophy\n(e.g., philosophy in the logic-based, rationalist tradition, as\nopposed to what is called the Continental tradition) from such\nthinkers as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty could be made against the\nrationalist tradition in AI. After further reading and study of\nDreyfus\u2019 writings, readers may judge whether this critique is\ncompelling, in an information-driven world increasingly managed by\nintelligent agents that carry out symbolic reasoning (albeit not even\nclose to the human level). \n\nFor readers interested in exploring philosophy of AI beyond what Jim\nMoor (in a recent address \u2013 \u201cThe Next Fifty Years of AI:\nFuture Scientific Research vs. Past Philosophical Criticisms\u201d\n\u2013 as the 2006 Barwise Award winner at the annual eastern\nAmerican Philosophical Association meeting) has called the \u201cthe\nbig three\u201d criticisms of AI, there is no shortage of additional\nmaterial, much of it available on the Web. The last chapter of\nAIMA provides a compressed overview of some additional\narguments against \u201cStrong\u201d AI, and is in general not a bad\nnext step. Needless to say, Philosophy of AI today involves much more\nthan the three well-known arguments discussed above, and, inevitably,\nPhilosophy of AI tomorrow will include new debates and problems we\ncan\u2019t see now. Because machines, inevitably, will get smarter\nand smarter (regardless of just how smart they get),\nPhilosophy of AI, pure and simple, is a growth industry. With every\nhuman activity that machines match, the \u201cbig\u201d questions\nwill only attract more attention. \n",
