    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Works\n1. Life and Philosophical Works\n\nGirolamo Cardano was born in Pavia in 1501 from Fazio and Chiara\nMicheri. Chiara delivered her baby in Pavia, in the house of family\nfriends, and not in Milan, to defuse a possible scandal concerning the\nillegitimate birth. Fazio would marry Chiara and recognize Girolamo\nonly later in 1524, just before his death. After a difficult\nchildhood, saddened by frequent illnesses and the harsh upbringing by\nhis overbearing father, Cardano enrolled at the University of Pavia to\nstudy medicine in 1520 against his father\u2019s wish. Fazio\n(1445\u20131524), a jurist and an accomplished practitioner of\nmathematics and natural philosophy (in 1480 he had published an\nedition of John Peckham\u2019s Perspectiva communis\n(\u201cGeneral Optics\u201d), written around 1265), wanted his son\nto undertake studies of law, but Girolamo felt more attracted to\nphilosophy and science. When, due to the ongoing war between France\nand Spain, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the\nuniversity, Cardano resumed his studies at the University of Padua,\nwhere he graduated in medicine in 1526. For about six years, he\npractised as a physician in Saccolungo, a village close to Padua,\nwhere he met and married Lucia Bandareni (1531). Three children were\nborn from this marriage: Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and\nAldo (1543). In the meantime, Cardano had been trying several times to\nbecome a member of the College of Physicians in Milan, but his\napplications had always been turned down, adding to his professional\nfrustration and disappointment. Rejections notwithstanding, he moved\nback to Milan with his family in 1532. He divided his time between\npractising medicine in Gallarate, a town nearby Milan, and teaching\nmathematics in the Piattine schools of Milan, a charitable institution\nfounded by the nobleman Tommaso Piatti in 1501 to improve knowledge of\nGreek, logic, astronomy, and mathematics among Milanese students from\na poor background. Fazio, too, had previously taught in this school.\nIn the meantime, his reputation as a successful practitioner in\nmedicine began to spread among the important families of Milan. In\n1539 his application to become a member of the College of Physicians\nwas finally accepted. Discontinuously, from 1543 to 1551, he taught\nmedicine at the University of Pavia, until 1552, when he went to\nScotland to treat the Archbishop of Edinburgh, John Hamilton, who was\nsuffering from a particularly severe form of asthma. Back to Milan in\n1553, he resumed teaching in Pavia in 1559. In 1560 his son Giovanni\nBattista was executed charged with the murder of his wife, Brandona\nSeroni, whom, against his father\u2019s will, he had married in 1557.\nThis tragic event represented a turning point in Cardano\u2019s life\nand intellectual career. In 1562, he decided to leave Pavia, whose\nacademic environment had become increasingly hostile, to teach\nmedicine in Bologna. As a result of mounting suspicions that he was\nactively spreading heretical views, he was arrested on 6 October 1570\nand remained in prison until 22 December of the same year. In February\n1571, before the Sacred Congregation led by Antonio Baldinucci,\nCardano was required to acknowledge and reject his serious crimes\nagainst the faith (abiura de vehementi), having been declared\n\u201cvehemently suspect of heresy.\u201d He solemnly swore that he\nwould no longer teach and publish books until his death. In 1571 he\nwent to Rome to serve as personal physician to Pope Pius V and then\nPope Gregory XIII. After having been admitted to the College of\nPhysicians in 1575, he died in Rome, on 20 September 1576, devoting\nhis last energies (from September 1575 to May 1576) to write his\nautobiography, De vita propria, published posthumously by\nGabriel Naud\u00e9 in 1643.\n\nCardano wrote and published a vast amount of works, in the most\ndisparate fields of knowledge, especially medicine, mathematics,\nastrology and natural history. His strictly philosophical treatises\ninclude: De arcanis aeternitatis (\u201cThe Mysteries of\nEternity\u201d, began at the end of the 1530s and published partially\nin the posthumous Opera omnia in 1663); De\nconsolatione (\u201cOn Consolation\u201d, 1543); De\nsapientia (\u201cOn Wisdom\u201d, 1544); De animi\nimmortalitate (\u201cOn the Immortality of the Soul\u201d,\n1545); De subtilitate (\u201cOn Subtlety\u201d, 1550, 1554,\n1560), and its twin book De rerum varietate (\u201cOn the\nVariety of Things\u201d, 1557); Theonoston (\u201cDivine\nKnowledge\u201d, written in the middle of 1550s and published\nposthumously in 1617 and 1663); De utilitate ex adversis\ncapienda (\u201cOn Gaining Advantage from Misfortunes\u201d,\n1561); Encomium Neronis (\u201cPraise of Nero\u201d);\nDialectica (\u201cDialectic\u201d), De uno\n(\u201cOn the One\u201d), Tetim seu de humana conditione\n(\u201cTetim, or On the Human Condition\u201d), De minimis et\npropinquis (\u201cOn Those Things which are Smallest and Closest\nto Hand\u201d), De summo bono (\u201cOn the Highest\nGood\u201d) and Guglielmus, sive de morte\n(\u201cWilliam, or On Death\u201d), all published in 1562;\nAntigorgias dialogus sive de recta vivendi ratione\n(\u201cAnti-Gorgias, or On the Right Way to Live\u201d),\nHyperchen (\u201cBeing\u201d) and De Socratis\nstudio (\u201cOn the Earnestness of Socrates\u201d), published\nin 1566; Proxeneta seu de prudentia civili (\u201cThe\nMediator, or Civic Prudence\u201d, published posthumously in 1627 and\n1663); Paralipomena (\u201cSupplements\u201d, begun in 1561\nand published posthumously in 1663). Other works were published\nposthumously in the Opera omnia edited by the French\nphysician Charles Spon (1609\u20131684) in 1666: Hymnus seu\ncanticum ad Deum (\u201cA Hymn, or a Canticle to God\u201d);\nMnemosynon (\u201cMemorial\u201d); Norma vitae\nconsarcinata (\u201cA Patched-Up Rule of Life\u201d); De\noptimo vitae genere (\u201cOn the Noblest Kind of Life\u201d);\nDialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani ipsius patris\n(\u201cDialogue between Girolamo Cardano and His Father\nFazio\u201d); De natura liber unicus (\u201cA Single Book\non Nature\u201d).\n\nGenerally speaking, Cardano\u2019s philosophy is heavily influenced\nby characteristic trends of late scholastic Aristotelianism, with a\nstrong penchant for Averroist interpretations. Cardano shows a great\ninterest in Averroes\u2019 opinion that one intellect would perform\nintellective functions for all human beings. However, he tends to\nprovide a historicized version of this radical view, in that he looks\nat the one intellect as the varying amount of learning accumulated by\nmankind throughout the centuries rather than simply justifying it from\na purely epistemological point of view (seen as the one intellective\npower that actualizes the life and knowledge of the sublunary world as\na whole). Cardano\u2019s philosophy also displays clear traces of\nPlatonic influences, absorbed through the reading of Marsilio\nFicino\u2019s recent translations and commentaries, especially\nPlotinus and Iamblichus. Together with his impressive knowledge of\nastrological and medical literature, both scholasticism and Platonism\ngive a characteristically vitalistic slant to his cosmological views.\nCardano\u2019s philosophy has often been described as suggestive and\nrich in original intuitions, but cluttered and inconsistent as a\nwhole. In fact, his philosophical work is yet another example, common\nduring the Renaissance, of how different philosophical traditions\n(including not only Aristotelianism and Platonism, but also\nEpicureanism and Stoicism, and not only Graeco-Roman, but also\nChristian and Arabic views) could converge into one composite but\ncoherent picture. Throughout his life, from his early endeavours in\nthe 1540s (De animi immortalitate) to the last philosophical\nattempt (Dialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani and\nDe propria vita), Cardano demonstrated a distinctive\ncommitment to a certain number of philosophical issues: the\nrelationship between oneness and multiplicity, with the notable\ncorollaries dealing with order and disorder, determinism and chance,\nlife and decay; the view of the intellect as the ultimate principle of\nreality and knowledge; a general theory of celestial heat, described\nas the main formative agent in nature; the interplay of nature and the\nsoul in the organization of the universe; a general doctrine of the\nimmortality of the soul, seen as the foundation of both cognitive\nclarity and moral certitude. As a whole, the originality of\nCardano\u2019s eclecticism lies in the unique way in which he\ncharacterizes the interdependence of life, knowledge and matter, in\nwhich a pronounced sense of reality and truth is constantly being\nquestioned and jeopardized by a realistic view of human nature,\nmercilessly presented as prone to fear, delusion and deceit.\n",
