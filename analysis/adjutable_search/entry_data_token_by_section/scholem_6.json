    "main_text": "Zionism\n7. Zionism\n\n\nAs mentioned, Scholem became a Zionist in 1911 when he was 14 years\nold. In many ways, and like many in his generation and locale, his\nZionism was one of protest against the bourgeois lifestyle and\nassimilated Jewish identity of his parents. In his native Germany\nHerzl's political Zionism was dominant but Scholem soon met\nEastern European immigrants and became exposed to the spiritual and\ncultural Zionism of Ahad ha-Am. He became involved in the Zionist youth\nmovement Blau Weiss (but later spoke out critically against it) and was\nstrongly influenced by the charismatic Martin Buber who was a leader\namong the Zionist youth in Germany at that time. He committed to\nimmigrating to Palestine quite early in his life, to some extent\nmotivated by the banishment from his home the fact that he was young,\nstill unmarried, and had few financial obligations. In any case, once\nhe arrived in Palestine he quickly became part of the German immigrant\nintelligentsia, some of whom had formed a group called Brit Shalom\ndedicated to the creation of a Jewish-Arab binational state. Some in\nthe group were committed radicals and liberals and others, like\nScholem, were more pragmatic in their approach, although he also viewed\nbinationalism as a moral obligation. In either case, almost all the\nmembers of Brit Shalom came from Germany (or spent time there) and,\nhaving experienced the Great War, had a bitter disdain for nationalism\nin general. They all saw the dangers of ethnocentric nationalism from\ntheir German past and all, as Zionists, wanted to deter any Jewish\nstate from repeating those errors.\n\n\nScholem's active participation in Brit Shalom was fairly\nshort-lived. He soured on the idea after the 1929 Hebron riots where\nPalestinian Arabs marauders attacked and killed Jewish civilians. This\nmassacre, which was a watershed event for many on the Jewish left at\nthat time, gave Scholem pause at to whether any true co-existence\ncould be possible. However, as late as 1937, in a letter to Walter\nBenjamin, his life-long friend who never accepted Zionism, Scholem\nwrote against partition (of separate Jewish and Arab states) and\nupheld his belief in binationalism as the \u201cmoral ideal\nsolution.\u201d After the Holocaust Scholem's belief in binationalism\neroded even more, even though he never abandoned a belief that, given\nother circumstances, it was the best option. In a letter in 1972 he\nadmitted Brit Shalom had mistakenly read the historical situation and\nthat \u201cHitler totally changed the perspective.\u201d As time\nwent on Scholem became reconciled with the state, and even defended\nit, although be spoke vociferously against the settlements after 1967\nand saw the movement as a dangerous combination of messianic\ntriumphalism and mystical optimism.\n\n\nScholars disagree as to the extent Scholem separated the two parts of\nhis life, first as a scholar of Jewish mysticism and second as a public\nintellectual, particularly a Zionist. Some argue that his Zionism is\nreflected in his entire scholarly career while others suggest he\nsuccessfully bifurcated both parts of his life. As a believer in the\nalmost mystical power of language he maintained that the revival of the\nHebrew language in Mandate Palestine/Israel was necessary to bring the\nesoteric components of the tradition \u2014 founded so deeply on the\nplay of language \u2014 to the fore. He also believed that Zionism in\nMandate Palestine/Israel, as a growing culture in need of a new\nidentity, was fertile ground for a renaissance constructed from the\nresources of forgotten dimensions of the tradition. This is not to say\nhe believed in some kind of neo-kabbalistic culture. He did not.\nScholem remained a committed secularist throughout his life believing,\nI think, that secularism and secular Zionism were a crucial part of any\nnew Jewish society. Perhaps, then, even those who maintain that\nScholem's academic work is not tainted by his ideology can agree\nthat for him Zionism, in its cultural and political manifestations,\nserved as the necessary frame for his project of reconstructing Jewish\nhistory from the perspective of mystical esotericism.\n",
