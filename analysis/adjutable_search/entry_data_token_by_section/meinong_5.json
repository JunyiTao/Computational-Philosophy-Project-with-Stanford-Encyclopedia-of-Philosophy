    "main_text": "Mind and Object || Mind as Object \u2014 Self-Presentation in Contrast to Other-Presentation\n4.2 Mind as Object \u2014 Self-Presentation in Contrast to Other-Presentation\n\nMeinong\u2019s so-called self-presentation\n[Selbstpr\u00e4sentation] usually counts as a mark of\nconsciousness, of the manifest mental. Experiences, i.e., conscious\nmental occurrences, are able to present themselves to a self. This\nkind of self-presentation is not yet presentation of the self or the\nego, which was not an issue for Meinong. It should also be set apart\nfrom self-evidence in the sense of infallibility, and from inner\nperception, self-observation, and higher-order thinking. The whole\nmanifest mental life is self-presenting, that is, all the experiences\nof a subject are self-presenting to the experiencing subject. If you\nare happy that it is raining, you can grasp your\nhappiness in inner perception, but not by means of a\nseparate mental content. That your mental experiences present\nthemselves to you means you refer to your instantaneous experiences\nwithout the intermediary of a further representation of them. You are\nable to reflect upon your momentary anger or upon your feeling of\nshame, for instance, without needing a kind of mental symbol of your\nanger or your feeling of shame.\n\nUsually, the objects of experiences are not constituted by their\nexperiences: they are something mind independent and not immanent to\nconsciousness. What is immanent to the mind (consciousness) are the\nexperiences themselves. When you have a representation of red, for\nexample, you are conscious of the object red. In such a\nrepresentation of red, the red-content serves as a kind of\nsign of something, i.e., red, and is itself a mental piece of\nthe whole representation. In order to present the red-content as\nobject of an inner reflective experience, you do not need a further,\nseparate representation with an additional mental content to which the\nred-content corresponds as object. The red-content has the capacity to\npresent itself to your mind. In general, the reference to one\u2019s\nown experiences does not require the intervention of an additional\ncontent. Meinong thinks that all inner experiences and\nall parts of them are able to be apprehended through\nself-presentation. Meinong (1910, \u00a720: 138 [103],\n\u00a743: 264 [190\u20131]; 1915, \u00a733; 1917, \u00a71)\ncalls it the self-presentation of inner experiences in\nopposition to the other-presentation\n[Fremdpr\u00e4sentation], where the content functions as sign\nfor something else. Since experiences do not need to be brought within\nthe range of apprehension by presentations (and contents) of their\nown, Meinong calls the self-presenting parts of an experience (act\ncomponent and content component) and the whole self-presenting\nexperience quasi-contents. The quasi-content coincides with\nthe object that is to be apprehended or intended. When you desire\nsomething, for example, it may also happen that you judge about your\ndesire. The whole desire, then, presents itself to your judgement\nwithout any supplementary interfering content. It plays the role of a\ncontent, so to speak \u2014 hence the name\n\u201cquasi-content.\u201d\n\nMeinong (1906, \u00a7\u00a711 and 13; 1910, \u00a743) thinks that\nattention allows us to do two different things with one and the same\nexperience and content respectively: (1) If we direct our attention to\nour inner experience, for instance, to the red content of a\nrepresentation of red, this very content serves for the inner\nperception of itself \u2014 the red-content becomes an intended\nobject and serves for the apprehension (perception) of itself. He also\nsays that in this case the content becomes turned inwards\n(introversion, [Einw\u00e4rtswendung]). (2) If the\ncontent contributes to a perception or a thought of something red, the\ncontent concerns something external to the mind \u2014 it serves for\nthe apprehension of the coordinated outer objects and can therefore be\ncalled turned outwards (extraversion,\n[Ausw\u00e4rtswendung]).\n\nMeinong would not accept the following highly controversial thesis of\nconsciousness:\n\n(C)\nConsciousness is necessarily such that if a subject s has\na conscious property P, s is also conscious of its*\nhaving the property P.\n\n\nThis is a thesis of self-consciousness in a twofold manner: First,\ns is conscious of itself in a direct (de se) manner \u2014\ntherefore, the third person pronoun is used with a Casta\u00f1eda\nasterisk as a sign of a \u201cquasi-indicator\u201d, i.e., an\nemphatic reflexive expressing the reference of the subject to itself\nqua itself (cf. the entry on\n indexicals,\n Section 5). Secondly, s is conscious of the conscious state\nit is in. Brentano accepted (C), with some provisos in order to avoid\nan infinite regress. Brentano thinks that conscious states (mental\nacts) are necessarily such that if a subject s is in a\nconscious state, s is also conscious of its* being in this\nstate. This self-consciousness is to be interpreted as inner\nperception, but not as a separate higher-order perception:\nEach mental act is primarily directed to an object (my hearing a sound\nhas the sound as its primary object), and it is incidentally\ndirected towards itself (my hearing a sound has itself as secondary\nobject). (See Brentano 1874, 2. Buch, 2. Kap., \u00a7\u00a78\u20139;\nBrentano 1982: 22\u20135).\n\nMeinong would instead state:\n\n\n\n(C1)\nBeing F is a self-presenting property for a subject\ns =df Being F is necessarily\nsuch that, if s is F, and if s thinks about\nits* being F, then s does not need any particular,\nseparate presentation of its* being F.\n(C2)\nBeing F is self-presented to a subject s\n=df (1) Being F is a self-presenting\nproperty for a subject s, (2) s is F, and\n(3) s thinks about its* being F.\n(C3)\nConscious properties are necessarily self-presenting properties,\nand self-presenting properties are necessarily conscious\nproperties.\n(C4)\nThe evidence one gets by self-presentation is (1) direct, (2)\ncertain (in the borderline case of immediate presence), and (3) a\nposteriori.\n\n\nConsciousness does not automatically include some kind of\nself-reflection. An experience\u2019s being conscious does not\nconsist in the subject\u2019s having a higher-order thought; that is,\nconsciousness only allows self-reflection by\nself-presentation in the sense of (C2), but does not already involve\nany higher-order thoughts or inner perception in a Brentanoan sense.\nMeinong\u2019s use of \u201cself-presentation\u201d seems to have\ntwo readings: (1) as an ability-based term, when you say that\nthe self-presentation of an experience consists in its\nability to be apprehended directly, that is, without any\nsupplementary psychological content; (2) as a nondispositional\nterm that expresses a manifest self-presentation in the\nsense that the experience is actually self-presented. (C3) expresses\nthe thesis that being a self-presenting state is a mark of\nconsciousness: The whole of a person\u2019s manifest mental life is\nself-presenting (understood as \u201cselfpresentable\u201d,\nas an ability-based term); that is, all experiences of a subject are\nin this sense self-presenting to the experiencing subject.
