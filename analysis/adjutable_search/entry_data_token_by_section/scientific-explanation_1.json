    "main_text": "The DN Model || The Basic Idea\n2.1 The Basic Idea\n\nAccording to the Deductive-Nomological Model, a scientific explanation\nconsists of two major \u201cconstituents\u201d: an\nexplanandum, which is a sentence \u201cdescribing the\nphenomenon to be explained\u201d and an explanans,\n\u201cthe class of those sentences which are adduced to account for\nthe phenomenon\u201d (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948 [1965: 247]). For\nthe explanans to successfully explain the explanandum several\nconditions must be met. First, \u201cthe explanandum must be a\nlogical consequence of the explanans\u201d and \u201cthe sentences\nconstituting the explanans must be true\u201d (Hempel 1948 [1965:\n248]). That is, the explanation should take the form of a sound\ndeductive argument in which the explanandum follows as a conclusion\nfrom the premises in the explanans. This is the\n\u201cdeductive\u201d component of the model. Second, the explanans\nmust contain at least one \u201claw of nature\u201d and this must be\nan essential premise in the derivation in the sense that the\nderivation of the explanandum would not be valid if this premise were\nremoved. This is the \u201cnomological\u201d component of the\nmodel\u2014\u201cnomological\u201d being a philosophical term of\nart which, suppressing some niceties, means (roughly)\n\u201clawful\u201d. In its most general formulation, the DN\nmodel is meant to apply both to the explanation of \u201cgeneral\nregularities\u201d or \u201claws\u201d such as (to use Hempel and\nOppenheim\u2019s examples) why light conforms to the law of\nrefraction and also to the explanation of particular events, conceived\nas occurring at a particular time and place, such as the bent\nappearance of the partially submerged oars of a rowboat on a\nparticular occasion of viewing. As an additional illustration of a\nDN explanation of a particular event, consider a derivation\nof the position of Mars at some future time from Newton\u2019s laws\nof motion, the Newtonian inverse square law governing gravity, and\ninformation about the mass of the sun, the mass of Mars and the\npresent position and velocity of each. In this derivation the various\nNewtonian laws figure as essential premises and they are used, in\nconjunction with appropriate information about initial conditions (the\nmasses of Mars and the sun and so on), to derive the explanandum (the\nfuture position of Mars) via a deductively valid argument. The\nDN criteria are thus satisfied.\n",
