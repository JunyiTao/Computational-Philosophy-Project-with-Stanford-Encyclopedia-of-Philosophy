    "main_text": "Justice in Holdings || The Historical Entitlement Doctrine about Justice in Holdings\n4.1 The Historical Entitlement Doctrine about Justice in Holdings\n\nNozick\u2019s approach to justice in holdings has to be seen as\nemerging from his broad construal of the implications of the\nRawlsian-Nozickean critique of utilitarianism. Whereas Rawls concludes\nthat a due respect for the separateness of persons precludes imposing\nlosses on individuals for the sake of the general welfare, Nozick\nconcludes that it precludes imposing losses upon individuals for the\nsake of any conception of the overall social\ngood\u2014including deeply distribution-sensitive conceptions. The\njustice of a given individual\u2019s possession of and discretionary\ncontrol over certain economic goods cannot be a function of that\npossession and control contributing to the general welfare or\nto any other overall social end-state or pattern. All such\nconsequentialist assessments of holdings are ruled out of court. So,\nif there is any acceptable account of the justice of individual\nholdings, it must be a backward-looking account. The justification\nmust depend upon how the holdings in question have arisen.\n\nIf the holding came about by permissible and title-conferring modes of\naction, the possessor will be entitled to it. If the holding came\nabout by modes of action that are not permissible (or are permissible\nbut not title-conferring) the possessor will not be entitled to it.\nThus, entitlements are historical. Individual A will have an\nentitlement to holding H if and only if A\u2019s\npossession of H has the right sort of history. This stance\naccords with the common-sense intuition that an agent\u2019s\nacquiring economically valuable objects in certain ways\u2014e.g.,\ncreating those objects out of unowned natural\nmaterials\u2014generates entitlements for that agent over those\nobjects while an agent\u2019s acquiring objects in other\nways\u2014e.g., seizing those objects from another who has created\nthem out of unowned natural materials\u2014does not generate\nentitlements for that agent over those objects. A distribution of\nholdings across individuals will be just insofar as the particular\nholdings that constitute that distribution are just\u2014rather than\nthe justice of any particular individual\u2019s holding depending on\nthe holistic justice of the distribution of which it is a part.\n\nJust acquisition takes the form of just initial acquisition, just\ntransfer, or just rectification of an unjust taking. An existing\nholding will be just if it arises from an act of just initial\nacquisition or an act of just initial acquisition followed by one or\nmore acts of just transfer, or an act of just rectification that\ncounteracts an unjust taking of a just holding. An adequate theory of\njustice in holdings will specify the processes that constitute just\ninitial acquisitions, just transfers, and just acts of rectification.\nNozick tells us that each of these principles is a \u201ccomplicated\ntruth\u201d (150) that he will not attempt to formulate. Thus, we\nnever get statements from Nozick of what specific initial acquisition\nor transfer or rectification processes that result in agent\nC\u2019s possession of H generate or convey to\nC an entitlement over H. Nozick never directly seeks\nto explain why certain specific processes\u2014certain specific means\nof acquisition\u2014have the power to generate or convey\nentitlements. He never addresses the ways in which historical\ncontingency and convention may select (from among morally eligible\nprocedures) the specific procedures that count as entitlement\nconferring within a given society. (Mack 2010 and Bryan 2017)\n\nNozick\u2019s lack of specification and explanation has mislead\ncommentators such as Cohen into thinking that, for Nozick, any not\nunjust process that results in C\u2019s possession of\nH generates or conveys an entitlement for C over\nH. \u201c\u2019[J]ust steps, for Nozick, are human actions\nthat are free of injustice\u2026\u201d (Cohen 1995: 39). Consider\nCohen\u2019s example of D\u2019s rolling pin accidentally\nrolling downhill from D\u2019s kitchen into\nC\u2019s kitchen where C innocently mistakes it for\nhis long-lost rolling pin. Cohen thinks that, since nothing within\nthis transfer process is unjust, Nozick is committed to the transfer\nbeing just and entitlement conveying and, hence, is committed to the\nimplausible conclusion that C would acquire a just claim to\nthe rolling pin. Although this sort of criticism rests on the mistaken\nidea that, for Nozick, just processes are simply not unjust processes,\nit does highlight how little Nozick does offer in the way of a\npositive account of the nature and power of entitlement generating or\nconveying processes.\n\nNozick thinks we are pushed to adopt some set of historical\nentitlement principles by the dethronement of consequentialist\ndoctrines of justice in holdings; and he then implicitly relies on his\nreaders\u2019 intuitions about what the content of those principles\nwill be. Such intuitions will, e.g., count against the thought that\none can engage in the initial just acquisition of H by\nwanting H or by intensely focusing one\u2019s attention on\nH and will support the thought that some sort of physical\nengagement with unowned materials is necessary for acquiring an\nentitlement to them. Similarly, such intuitions will count against the\nthought that an accidental transfer of a rolling pin from\nD\u2019s kitchen to C\u2019s kitchen will convey\nthe right to the pin from D to C and will support\nthe thought that such a conveyance requires some sort of informed and\nvoluntary interaction between D and C.\n",
