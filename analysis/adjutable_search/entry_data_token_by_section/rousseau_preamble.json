    "main_text": "\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau remains an important figure in the history of\nphilosophy, both because of his contributions to political philosophy\nand moral psychology and on account of his influence on later\nthinkers. Rousseau\u2019s own view of most philosophy and\nphilosophers was firmly negative, seeing them as post-hoc\nrationalizers of self-interest, as apologists for various forms of\ntyranny, and as playing a role in the alienation of the modern\nindividual from humanity\u2019s natural impulse to compassion. The\nconcern that dominates Rousseau\u2019s work is to find a way of\npreserving human freedom in a world where people are increasingly\ndependent on one another to satisfy their needs. This concern has two\ndimensions: material and psychological, of which the latter has\ngreater importance. In the modern world, human beings get their very\nsense of their identity and value from the opinion of others, which\nRousseau sees as corrosive of freedom and destructive of individual\nauthenticity. In his mature work, he principally explores two routes\nto achieving and protecting freedom: the first is a political one\naimed at constructing institutions that permit and foster the\nco-existence of free and equal citizens in a community where they\nthemselves are sovereign; the second is a project for child\ndevelopment and education that nurtures autonomy and avoids the\ngenesis of the most destructive forms of self-interest. However,\nthough Rousseau believes the co-existence of human beings in relations\nof equality and freedom is possible, he is consistently and\noverwhelmingly pessimistic that humanity will escape from a dystopia\nof alienation, oppression, and unfreedom. In addition to his\ncontributions to philosophy, Rousseau was active as a composer and a\nmusic theorist, as the pioneer of modern autobiography, as a novelist,\nand as a botanist. Rousseau\u2019s appreciation of the wonders of\nnature and his stress on the importance of feeling and emotion made\nhim an important influence on and anticipator of the romantic\nmovement. To a very large extent, the interests and concerns that mark\nhis philosophical work also inform these other activities, and\nRousseau\u2019s contributions in ostensibly non-philosophical fields\noften serve to illuminate his philosophical commitments and\narguments.\n",
