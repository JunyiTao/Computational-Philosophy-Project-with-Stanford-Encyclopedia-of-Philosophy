    "main_text": "A Unificationist Account of Explanation || The Illustrations Criticized\n5.3 The Illustrations Criticized\n\nAs remarked at the beginning of this section, the idea that\nexplanation is connected in some way to unification is intuitively\nappealing. Nonetheless Kitcher\u2019s particular way of cashing out\nthis connection has been subject to criticism. In connection with\nKitcher\u2019s treatment of explanatory asymmetries, consider,\nfollowing Barnes (1992), a time-symmetric theory like Newtonian\nmechanics, applied to a closed system like the solar system. Call\nderivations of the state of motion of planets at some future time\nt from information about their present positions (at time\n\\(t_0\\)), masses, and velocities, the forces incident on them at\n\\(t_0\\), and the laws of mechanics predictive. Now contrast\nsuch derivations with retrodictive derivations in which the\npresent motions of the planets are derived from information about\ntheir future velocities and positions at t, the forces\noperative at t, and so on. It looks as though there will be\njust as many retrodictive derivations as predictive derivations, and\neach will require premises of exactly the same general\nsort\u2014information about positions, velocities, masses, etc. and\nthe same laws. Thus the pattern or patterns instantiated by the\nretrodictive derivations look(s) exactly as unified as the pattern or\npatterns associated with the predictive derivations. However, we\nordinarily think of the predictive derivations and not the\nretrodictive derivations as explanatory and the present state of the\nplanets as the cause of their future state and not vice-versa. \n\nOne possible response to this second example is to bite the bullet and\nto argue that from the point of view of fundamental physics, there\nreally is no difference in the explanatory import of the retrodictive\nand predictive derivations, and that it is a virtue, not a defect, of\nthe unificationist approach that it reproduces this judgment. Whatever\nmight be said in favor of this response, it is not Kitcher\u2019s.\nHis claim is that our ordinary judgments about causal asymmetries can\nbe derived from the unificationist account. The example just described\ncasts doubt on this claim. More generally, it casts doubt on\nKitcher\u2019s contention that one can begin with the notion of\nexplanatory unification, understood in a way that does not presuppose\ncausal notions, and use it to derive the content of causal\njudgments.\n\nSelected Readings: The most detailed statement of\nKitcher\u2019s position can be found in Kitcher (1989). Salmon (1989:\n94ff.) contains a critical discussion of Friedman\u2019s version of\nthe unificationist account of explanation but ends by advocating a\n\u201crapprochement\u201d between unificationist approaches and\nSalmon\u2019s own causal mechanical model. Woodward (2003) contains\nadditional criticisms of Kitcher\u2019s version of\nunificationism.\n",
