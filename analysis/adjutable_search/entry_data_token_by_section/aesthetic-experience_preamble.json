    "main_text": "\n\nA paradigmatic aesthetic experience is a perceptual experience focused\non the beauty of an object like a work of art or an aspect of nature.\nSome philosophers take it that this is the only kind of aesthetic\nexperience, though many more take it that there are other varieties as\nwell. You might, for instance, have an aesthetic experience by\nwitnessing not a beautiful but a sublime storm. You might\nhave an aesthetic experience not by having a perceptual but rather by\nhaving an (imagined) emotional experience of the deep suffering of\nSethe expressed in Toni Morrison\u2019s great novel Beloved.\nPerhaps you might even have an aesthetic experience by appreciating\nthe way in which an elegant theorem reorganizes your thought about a\nmathematical structure.\n\nPhilosophical work on art and beauty in the Western tradition extends\nback at least as far as the ancient Greeks, but the concept of\naesthetic experience as such emerged in this tradition only in the\n18th century. Not all who work in this area take any form\nof experience to be the most fundamental concept for aesthetic theory;\nothers take evaluative aesthetic judgments, or the aesthetic value of\nobjects themselves, to be more basic in explaining the relevant\nphenomena. This entry discusses all those views in the Western\ntradition with any theory of aesthetic experience at all\u2014not\nonly those views that take aesthetic experience to be fundamental.\n\nPhilosophers use the idea of a distinctively aesthetic\nexperience for several different purposes. Some use it to defend deep,\neffortful engagement with the arts or art criticism (Shelley 1832\n[2003]). Some use it to give a substantive definition of art (Tolstoy\n1897 [2007]), or to elevate \u2018real\u2019 art over other cultural\nmedia (Collingwood 1938 [1958]). Some use it to argue for the personal\nor social importance of an education in sensibility (Schiller 1795\n[1989]). Others describe aesthetic experience as a special form of\ncognitive contact with the world, perhaps even with its fundamental\nmetaphysics (Schopenhauer 1818 [1958]). Only a few now question the\nutility of the concept of aesthetic experience (Shusterman 1997, 2008,\nNehamas 1998).\n\nGiven this diversity of purposes, it is difficult to say much about\naesthetic experience that is not controversial. But a few questions\ncan be posed for all theories of aesthetic experience. What is\ndistinctive about aesthetic experience? What is valuable about having\nan experience of this kind? How if at all, does it involve evaluating\nits own object? Who can have these experiences, and under what\nconditions? Does it make sense to say that we should have\nsuch experiences?\n\nThese questions will be answered on behalf of various different\napproaches to aesthetic experience in the course of this overview. The\noverview organizes such approaches along two dimensions: in terms of\nthe properties of an object on which such experience focuses; and in\nterms of various internal aspects of the experience itself.\n",
