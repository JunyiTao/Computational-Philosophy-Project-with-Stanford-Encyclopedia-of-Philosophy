Universals According to Abelard\u2019s Aristotelian Conception\n\nIt was Abelard who first dealt with the problem of universals\nexplicitly in this form. Having relatively easily disposed of putative\nuniversal forms as real entities corresponding to Boethius\u2019\ndefinition, in his Logica Ingredientibus he concludes that\ngiven Aristotle\u2019s definition of universals in his On\nInterpretation as those things that can be predicated of several\nthings, it is only universal words that can be regarded as\nreally existing universals. However, since according to\nAristotle\u2019s account in the same work, words are meaningful in\nvirtue of signifying concepts in the mind, Abelard soon arrives at the\nfollowing questions:\n\nWhat is the common cause in accordance with which a\ncommon name is imposed?\nWhat is the understanding\u2019s common conception of\nthe likeness of things?\nIs a word called \u201ccommon\u201d on account of the common\ncause things agree in, or on account of the common conception, or on\naccount of both together? [Five Texts, Spade 1994, p. 41\n(88)]\n\n\nThese questions open up a new chapter in the history of the problem of\nuniversals. For these questions add a new aspect to the bundle of the\noriginally primarily ontological, epistemological, and theological\nquestions constituting the problem, namely, they add a\nsemantic aspect. On the Aristotelian conception of universals\nas universal predicables, there obviously are\nuniversals, namely, our universal words. But the universality of our\nwords is clearly not dependent on the physical qualities of our\narticulate sounds, or of the various written marks indicating them,\nbut on their representative function. So, to give an account of the\nuniversality of our universal words, we have to be able to tell in\nvirtue of what they have this universal representative function, that\nis to say, we have to be able to assign a common cause by the\nrecognition of which in terms of a common concept we can give\na common name to a potential infinity of individuals\nbelonging to the same kind.\n\nBut this common cause certainly cannot be a common thing in\nthe way Boethius described universal things, for, as we have seen, the\nassumption of the existence of such a common thing leads to\ncontradictions. To be sure, Abelard also provides a number of further\narguments, dealing with several refinements of Boethius\u2019\ncharacterization of universals proposed by his contemporaries, such as\nWilliam of Champeaux, Bernard of Chartres, Clarembald of Arras,\nJocelin of Soissons, and Walter of Mortagne \u2013 but I cannot go\ninto those details\n here.[28]\n The point is that he refutes and rejects all these suggestions to\nsave real universals either as common things, having their own real\nunity, or as collections of several things, having a merely collective\nunity. The gist of his arguments against the former view is that the\nuniversal thing on that view would have to have its own numerical\nunity, and therefore, since it constitutes the substance of all its\nsingulars, all these singulars would have to be substantially one and\nthe same thing which would have to have all their contrary properties\nat the same time, which is impossible. The main thrust of his\narguments against the collection-theory is that collections are\narbitrary integral wholes of the individuals that make them up, so\nthey simply do not fill the bill of the Porphyrian characterizations\nof the essential predicables such as genera and\n species.[29]\n\nSo, the common cause of the imposition of universal words cannot be\nany one thing, or a multitude of things; yet, being a common\ncause, it cannot be nothing. Therefore, this common cause,\nwhich Abelard calls the\n status[30]\n of those things to which it is common, is a cause, but it is a cause\nwhich is a non-thing. However strange this may sound, Abelard observes\nthat sometimes we do assign causes which are not\nthings. For example, when we say \u201cThe ship was wrecked\nbecause the pilot was absent\u201d, the cause that we assign, namely,\nthat the pilot was absent is not some thing, it is rather\nhow things were, i.e., the way things were, which in\nthis case we signify by the whole proposition \u201cThe pilot was\n absent\u201d.[31]\n From the point of view of understanding what Abelard\u2019s\nstatus are, it is significant that he assimilates the causal\nrole of status as the common cause of imposition to causes\nthat are signified by whole propositions. These significata\nof whole propositions, which in English we may refer to by using the\ncorresponding \u201cthat-clauses\u201d (as I did above, referring to\nthe cause of the ship\u2019s wreck by the phrase \u201cthat the\npilot was absent\u201d), and in Latin by an\naccusative-with-infinitive construction, are what Abelard calls the\ndicta of propositions. These dicta, not being\nidentifiable with any single thing, yet, not being nothing, constitute\nan ontological realm that is completely different from that of\nordinary things. But it is also in this realm that Abelard\u2019s\ncommon causes of imposition may find their place.\n\nAbelard says that the common cause of imposition of a universal name\nhas to be something in which things falling under that name agree. For\nexample, the name \u2018man\u2019 (in the sense of \u2018human\nbeing\u2019, and not in the sense of \u2018male human being\u2019)\nis imposed on all humans on account of something in which all humans,\nas such, agree. But that in which all humans as such agree is that\neach one of them is a man, that is, each one agrees with all others in\ntheir being a man. So, it is their being human [esse\nhominem] that is the common cause Abelard was looking for, and\nthis is what he calls the status of man. The status\nof man is not a thing; it is not any singular man, for obviously no\nsingular man is common to all men, and it is not a universal man, for\nthere is no such a thing. But being a man is common in the\nrequired manner (i.e., it is something in which all humans agree), yet\nit is clearly not a thing. For let us consider the singular\npropositions \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019 [Socrates est\nhomo], \u2018Plato is a man\u2019 [Plato est homo],\netc. These signify their dicta, namely, Socrates\u2019s\nbeing a man [Socratem esse hominem], and Plato\u2019s being\na man [Platonem esse hominem], etc. But then it is clear that\nif we abstract from the singular subjects and retain what is common to\nthem all, we can get precisely the status in which all these\nsubjects agree, namely, being a man [esse hominem]. So, the\nstatus, just like the dicta from which they can be\nobtained, constitute an ontological realm that is entirely different\nfrom that of ordinary things.\n\nStill, despite the fact that it clearly has to do something with\nabstraction, an activity of the mind, Abelard insists that a\nstatus is not a concept of our mind. The reason for his\ninsistence is that the status, being the common\ncause of imposition of a common name, must be something real, the\nexistence of which is not dependent on the activity of our minds. A\nstatus is there in the nature of things, regardless of\nwhether we form a mental act whereby we recognize it or not. In fact,\nfor Abelard, a status is an object of the divine mind,\nwhereby God preconceives the state of his creation from\n eternity.[32]\n A concept, or mental image of our mind, however, exists as\nthe object of our mind only insofar as our mind performs the mental\nact whereby it forms this object. But this object, again, is not a\nthing, indeed, not any more than any other fictitious object of our\nminds. However, what distinguishes the universal concept from\na merely fictitious object of our mind is that the former\ncorresponds to a status of really existing singular things,\nwhereas the latter does not have anything corresponding to it.\n\nTo be sure, there are a number of points left in obscurity by\nAbelard\u2019s discussion concerning the relationships of the items\ndistinguished here. For example, Abelard says that we cannot conceive\nof the status. However, it seems that we can only signify by\nour words whatever we can conceive. Yet, Abelard insists that besides\nour concepts, our words must signify the status\n themselves.[33]\n A solution to the problem is only hinted at in Abelard\u2019s remark\nthat the names can signify status, because \u201ctheir\ninventor meant to impose them in accordance with certain\nnatures or characteristics of things, even if he did not know how to\nthink out the nature or characteristic of the thing\u201d (Five\nTexts, Spade 1994, p. 46 (116)). So, we may assume that although\nthe inventor of the name does not know the status, his vague,\n\u201csenses-bound\u201d conception, from which he takes\nhis word\u2019s signification, is directed at the status, as\nto that which he intends to\n signify.[34]\n However, Abelard does not work out this suggestion in any further\ndetail. Again, it is unclear how the status is related to the\nindividualized natures of the things that agree in the\nstatus. If the status is what the divine mind\nconceives of the singulars in abstraction from them, why\ncouldn\u2019t the nature itself be conceived in the same way? \u2013\nafter all, the abstract nature would not have to be a thing any more\nthan a status is, for its existence would not be\nreal being, but merely its being conceived.\nFurthermore, it seems quite plausible that Abelard\u2019s\nstatus could be derived by abstraction from singular\ndicta with the same predicate, as suggested above. But\ndicta are the quite ordinary significata of\nour propositions, which Abelard never treats as\nepistemologically problematic, so why would the status, which\nwe could apparently abstract from them, be accessible only to the\ndivine mind?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Abelard could not provide acceptable and\ncoherent answers to these and similar questions and\n problems.[35]\n But perhaps these problems also contributed to the fact that by the\n13th century his doctrine of status was no longer\nin currency. Another historical factor that may have contributed to\nthe waning of Abelard\u2019s theory was probably the influence of the\nnewly translated Aristotelian writings along with the Arabic\ncommentaries that flooded the Latin West in the second half of the\n12th century.\n",
