He says in this\nregard (at codan\u0101 verse 53) that \u201cthe epistemic\nreliability of cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting\nof cognition\u201d\u2014that, in other words, it is simply in the\nnature of contentful awareness to make an epistemic claim on the\nsubject thereof, and that these claims are to be suspended or set aside\nonly when specifically countervailing cognitions are forthcoming.\nMoreover, one typically does not go seeking knowledge that\none\u2019s first-order cognitions are false; rather, it is only when\npresented with overriding cognitions\u2014cognitions,\nKum\u0101rila says, typically brought about \u201ceffortlessly,\u201d i.e.,\nwithout any ostensibly justificatory search on the part of the\nsubject\u2014that one sometimes finds it necessary to revise one\u2019s\njudgments. Kum\u0101rila does not propose, then, that one must first\nconsider and rule out all possible defeaters before arriving at\nconviction; the point, rather, is that one\u2019s judgment is justified\nuntil and unless some specifically overriding cognition happens to be\nforthcoming.\n\n\nAn account of the possible overriding of prima facie justified beliefs\nturns out, then, to be integral to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology.\nOne might, in this regard, worry that on the view he thus proposes,\nsecond-order cognitions of defeaters end up themselves having a\nprivileged status; that is, Kum\u0101rila might be thought to credit\n\u201coverriding cognitions\u201d\n(b\u0101dhakaj\u00f1\u0101na) with a capacity for effecting\nepistemic closure such as he does not allow for the initial cognitions\nthus overridden (which, as with scientific hypotheses for Popper, are\ntaken as never able to provide any definitive epistemic\nclosure). Thus, for example, it could be supposed that one might just\nas well conclude, from the fact that two contradictory cognitions have\narisen, that the second one is suspect\u2014and that it\nwould therefore be unwarrantedly privileging \u201coverriding\u201d\ncognitions to suppose that second-order cognitions ipso facto\ncount as evidence of the falsity of the prior cognitions on which they\nbear.  Here, though, it matters that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s account\ninvolves essentially phenomenological considerations; his point is\njust that a subsequent cognition calls for the revision of a preceding\none only if it seems to a subject to do so. Thus, to\nhave some prima facie justified belief subsequently called into\nquestion just is for the subsequent cognition to present\nitself as having, phenomenologically, the force of overriding the\npreceding; if that is not how the second awareness seems, then its\nphenomenological content will not be that of an overriding\ncognition in the first place, and it therefore will not present itself\nto the subject thereof as undermining any already-held belief.\n\n\nIt might also be worried that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s account of\nfalsification leaves the epistemic process infinitely open, with\nsomething like an infinite regress of potential revisions\u2014that\nwe could never be entitled, on this account, to claim anything like\nknowledge. Regarding this line of objection,\n Kum\u0101rila\n and his\ncommentators finally fall back on an appeal to common sense, urging\nthat it is unreasonable to encourage doubt where no specific cognition\nof any deficiencies explicitly raises one; otherwise, as the\ncommentator Sucaritami\u015bra puts it, \u201cthere would be the\nunwanted consequence of annihilating all worldly discourse.\u201d The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas thus take it that skeptical concerns can\nreasonably be pressed only so far, and that if it is thought that we\nare entitled only to those beliefs that have been decisively secured\nagainst all such doubts, then it would turn out that we know very\nlittle indeed. This thought reflects, again, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncommonsense realism, according to which it is beyond doubt that we\ndo know a great deal, and that any epistemology according to\nwhich that turns out to be problematic is, ipso facto, to be\nthought suspect.\n",
