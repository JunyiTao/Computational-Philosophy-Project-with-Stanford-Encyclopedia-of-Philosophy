    "main_text": "Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations || Three Themes of Embodied Cognition\n2.1 Three Themes of Embodied Cognition\n\n\nThe three themes of embodiment around which most of the following\ndiscussion will be organized are as follows.\n\nConceptualization: The properties of an\norganism\u2019s body limit or constrain the concepts an organism can\nacquire. That is, the concepts by which an organism understands its\nenvironment depend on the nature of its body in such a way that\ndifferently embodied organisms would understand their environments\ndifferently.\n\nReplacement: The array of computationally-inspired\nconcepts, including symbol, representation, and\ninference, on which traditional cognitive science has drawn\nmust be abandoned in favor of others that are better-suited to the\ninvestigation of bodily-informed cognitive systems.\n\nConstitution: The body (and, perhaps, parts of the\nworld) does more than merely contribute causally to cognitive\nprocesses: it plays a constitutive role in cognition, literally as a\npart of a cognitive system. Thus, cognitive systems consist in more\nthan just the nervous system and sensory organs.\n\n\nThe theses above are not intended to be individually\nexclusive\u2014embodied cognition research might show tendencies\ntoward more than one at a time. Similarly, descriptions of embodied\ncognition might be organized around a larger number of narrower themes\n(M. Wilson 2002); however, efforts to broaden the themes, thereby\nreducing their number, risks generalizing the description of embodied\ncognition to the extent that its purported novelty is jeopardized.\n\n\nBefore examining how these themes receive expression, it is worth\npausing to compare embodied cognition to some closely related research\nareas. Sometimes embodied cognition is distinguished from\nembedded cognition, as well as extended cognition and\nenactive cognition. However, despite the distinctions between\nthe four \u201cEs\u201d\u2014embodied, embedded, enactive, and\nextended\u2014it is not uncommon to use the label\n\u201cembodied\u201d to include any or all of these\n\u201cEs\u201d. The E-fields share the view, after all, that the\nbrain-centrism of traditional cognitive science, as well as its\ndependence on the computer for inspiration, stands in the way of a\ncorrect understanding of cognition.\n",
