    "main_text": "The 20th Century || . The Years of Expansion (1960\u20132000)\n9. The 21st Century\n\nNot unlike other areas of Mexican culture, the production of\nphilosophy has been concentrated in Mexico City. However, today dozens\nof philosophy departments throughout the Mexican Republic are growing\nin size and influence. Many universities now offer graduate degrees\nand some publish their own journals and books, such as the state\nuniversities of Guanajuato, Michoac\u00e1n, Puebla, Veracruz, and\nZacatecas.\n\nThere are several philosophical associations in Mexico, though the\nAsociaci\u00f3n filos\u00f3fica de M\u00e9xico is the\nlargest. Since 1975, the AFM (which serves a role similar to the\nAmerican Philosophical Association (in the United States) hosts a\nlarge biannual conference that plays an essential role in forming a\nnational philosophical community (see\n Other Internet Resources below).\n\nPhilosophy also continues to play an important role in Mexican\nsecondary education. Although philosophy has been taught in public\nhigh schools since the 19th century, in 2009 the Mexican\ngovernment tried to eliminate philosophical instruction from public\neducation (not unlike the second half of the 19th century\nunder the guidance of Barreda\u2019s positivist curriculum, and\nCardenas\u2019s attempt to make education in Mexico socialist in\n1933). However, in response, a group of academics founded the\nObservatorio Filos\u00f3fico de M\u00e9xico, which\neventually thwarted government interference (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The Observatorio\u2019s defense of philosophy in Mexico was\nso successful that in 2019, the government made a constitutional\namendment recognizing philosophical instruction as the right of all\nMexicans.\n\nThis official commitment to the value of philosophy is not without\nprecedent; it represents a long history of questioning and reaffirming\nthe role of philosophy in Mexican life. Other events in this history\n(discussed above) include the war for Mexican independence, guided by\nEnlightenment philosophy; Gabino Barreda\u2019s effort to define\nMexican national identity through positivist education; the\nAteneo\u2019s critique of positivism during the Mexican\nRevolution; amendments to the 1933 Constitution, which sought to make\npublic education socialist; and the philosophy of lo\nmexicano, a philosophical expression and critique of\n20th century Mexican nationalism.\n\nOne challenge to studying Mexican philosophy outside Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, has been the lack of resources in\nEnglish. However, over the past several years, a group of scholars\nhave begun to produce translations of and commentaries on canonical\ntexts. One notable example is Mexican Philosophy in the\n20th Century: Essential Readings, edited by Carlos\nAlberto S\u00e1nchez and Robert Eli Sanchez, Jr. (For future\nprojects related to making Mexican philosophy more widely available in\nEnglish, and related to building a binational community dedicate to\nthe development of Mexican philosophy, see\n 20th Century Mexican Philosophy in Other Internet Resources.)\n The APA\u2019s Newsletter on Hispanic and Latino Issues in\nPhilosophy is another valuable source of information and research\n(see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nToday, Mexican philosophy is a professional, pluralistic, and growing\nfield of study. Thanks in large part to the collaboration among\nphilosophers in Mexico and United States, the resources required to\nadvance research are now easily accessible in both Spanish and\nEnglish. And with the ongoing emergence of new translations,\ncommentaries, and histories, as well as regular binational meetings,\nit is now reasonable to expect that the philosophy produced in Mexico\nand about the Mexican (or Mexican-American) experience will continue\nto attract new scholars and will soon be recognized for its impressive\ncontribution to world philosophy.\n",
