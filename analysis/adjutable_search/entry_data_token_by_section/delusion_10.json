    "main_text": "Delusions and the Continuity Thesis || Are delusions irrational?\n4.1 Are delusions irrational?\n\nThere is no doubt that the definitions of delusions in DSM-IV and\nDSM-5 characterise delusions as irrational beliefs. However, in the\nphilosophical literature on delusions, the status of delusions as\nirrational beliefs does not go unchallenged. Are delusions really\nirrational? If so, in what way?\n\nIn a number of influential papers Brendan Maher (1974, 1988, 1999,\n2003) argues that delusions are not ill-formed beliefs, and that there\nis nothing irrational in the relationship between the evidence\nsupporting the delusional hypothesis and the formation of such a\nhypothesis. According to Maher, the unusual nature of the delusion is due to the unusual nature of the experiences on the basis of\nwhich the delusion is formed. By reference to Maher\u2019s model,\nBlaney (1999) describes delusions as \u2018false but\nreasonable\u2019. Some difficulties have been identified with this\nstrategy. A first difficulty is that there seem to be people who\nsuffer from the same type of brain damage, and plausibly have the same\nexperience, as the people who develop the delusion, but do not accept\nany delusional hypotheses. How can these people avoid forming a\ndelusion? One possible answer is that those who have unusual\nexperiences and do not form the delusion have hypothesis-evaluation\nmechanisms that work efficiently, and thus end up rejecting hypotheses\nwith low probability and plausibility. But those who have unusual\nexperiences and do form the delusion are instead affected by an\nadditional problem, maybe a deficit at the level of hypothesis\nevaluation, which can be conceived as a failure of rationality.\n\nOn Maher\u2019s view, [\u2026] [i]t follows that anyone who has\nsuffered neuropsychological damage that reduces the affective response\nto faces should exhibit the Capgras delusion; anyone with a right\nhemisphere lesion that paralyzes the left limbs and leaves the subject\nwith a sense that the limbs are alien should deny ownership of the\nlimbs; anyone with a loss of the ability to interact fluently with\nmirrors should exhibit mirrored-self misidentification, and so on.\nHowever, these predictions from Maher\u2019s theory are clearly\nfalsified by examples from the neuropsychological literature (Davies\net al. 2001, p. 144).\n\n\nAnother difficulty with Maher\u2019s original account of delusions as\n\u2018false but reasonable\u2019 is that, even if the unusual nature\nof the experience were to satisfactorily explain the acceptance of the\ndelusional hypothesis and the formation of the delusion, this would\nnot be sufficient to guarantee that the behavior associated with having\ndelusions is overall rational. An explanation is needed for why\ndelusions are maintained in the face of counterevidence once the\ndelusional hypothesis has been formed and endorsed (see Gerrans\n2002a). One aspect of the notion of rationality for beliefs is that we\nare disposed to revise or abandon beliefs that seem to be in conflict\nwith the acquired evidence. The \u201cincorrigibility\u201d of\ndelusions speaks in favor of their being held\nirrationally.\n\nSo, one argument for the view that delusions are irrational comes from\nan examination of the relationship between the content of the delusion\nand the available evidence. Resistance to revising or abandoning the\ndelusion in the face of powerful counterevidence or counterargument is\na sign of irrationality: when we have delusions, we may ignore\nrelevant evidence or attempt to defend our delusional beliefs from\napparent objections with obvious confabulations. Often these attempts\nare deeply perplexing, and the reasons offered for believing the\ncontent of our delusions do not appear as be good reasons to others:\nin one of the examples of delusions offered at the start of this\nentry, a woman incorrectly believed that a man was in love with her\nand her evidence for that claim was that he was sending her secret\nlove messages hidden in the license plates on cars of a certain state.\nHowever, the notion that delusions fail to be responsive to evidence\nhas also been challenged: for instance, Flores 2021 convincingly\nargues that when we have delusions we have the capacity to respond to\nevidence that has a bearing on the content of the delusions, but other\nfactors contribute to the fact that we resist counterevidence, such as\nmotivational factors.\n\nOne reason why maintaining delusional beliefs may be seen as irrational\nis that the content of the delusions is often in tension with the\ncontent of our other beliefs, or with our behavior (Gerrans 2000, p.\n114 and Young 2000, p. 49) . That is, when a delusion is introduced\nand maintained within our belief system, it creates inconsistencies\nand does not always drive the actions we would expect given its\ncontent. Here are some examples. In the course of the same interview,\na woman may claim that her husband died four years earlier and was\ncremated and that her husband is a patient in the same hospital where\nshe is (Breen et al. 2000, p. 91). In Capgras delusion,\npeople may worry about the disappearance of their loved one, but also\nbe cooperative and even flirtatious with the alleged impostor (see\nLucchelli and Spinnler 2007). This suggests that delusions do not\nalways give rise to appropriate action (Bleuler 1950; Sass 2001),\nalthough they must be reported either spontaneously or after\nquestioning, or they could not be diagnosed as delusions. How can our\napparent strong conviction in the content of the delusion be squared\nwith our failure to act on it? One hypothesis is that the content of\nthe delusion is not genuinely believed. Another hypothesis is that we\ngenuinely believe the content of the delusion but do not convert it\ninto action, because we fail to acquire or maintain the motivation to\nact on the delusion. This would be consistent with negative symptoms\nof schizophrenia, as Bortolotti and Broome 2012 argue. \n\nOne should not be too impressed by evidence of \u2018behavioural\ninertia\u2019, however, as there are also\nmany examples in the literature of delusions driving action.\nAffected by perceptual delusional bicephaly, the delusion that one has\ntwo heads, a man who believed that the second head belonged to his\nwife\u2019s gynecologist attempted to attack it with an axe. When the\nattack failed he attempted it to shoot it down and as a result he was\nhospitalized with gunshot wounds (Ames 1984). Cases of Cotard delusion\nhave been reported where people stop eating and bathing themselves as\na consequence of believing that they are dead (Young and Leafhead\n1996).\n\nRelevant to the question whether delusions are rational, the empirical\nliterature suggests that our reasoning performance when we have\ndelusions reflects data-gathering and attribution biases. For\ninstance, it has been argued that people with delusions \u2018jump to\nconclusions\u2019; need less evidence to be convinced that a\nhypothesis is true (Garety 1991; Huq et al. 1988; Garety and\nFreeman 1999); and are more hasty in their decisions (Moritz and\nWoodward 2005; Fine et al. 2007). Other biases have also been\nnoted: people with delusions of persecution tend to attribute the\nresponsibility of negative events to other people (e.g., McKay et\nal. 2005b) whereas in the Cotard delusion there seems to be a\ntendency to attribute the responsibility of negative events to oneself\n(Young and Leafhead 1996; Gerrans 2000; McKay and Cipolotti 2007).\nPeople with delusions seem to be worse than controls at inhibiting the\nevidence of their senses when it conflicts with other things they know\n(Langdon et al. 2008b) and have an accentuated need for\nclosure which comprises a desire for clarity and structure (see\nKruglanski 1989, p. 14). These data are not by themselves sufficient\nto support the view that delusions are irrational, but show that we can \ndeviate from statistically normal reasoning performance when we have\ndelusions.\n\nA recent debate relevant to the rationality of delusions concerns the\nstep from unusual events to delusional beliefs. (This is primarily an\nissue that emerged among two-factor theorists, so the language used\nbelow is acceptable to them, but the problem can be reformulated in\nterms that are friendly to prediction-error theorists.) Coltheart\net al. 2010 argue that the step from unusual data to belief\nis an instance of abductive inference, as those who end up endorsing a\ndelusional belief need to select an explanatory hypothesis for their\nunusual data from a range of relevant hypotheses. Coltheart and\ncolleagues use the Bayesian model of abductive inference which invites\nus to ask two questions: Which hypothesis better explains the data?\nWhich hypothesis is the most plausible given what we already know? In\nthe case of delusions, they argue, it is reasonable to adopt the\ndelusional hypothesis given the data, and the good fit between\nhypothesis and data swamps general considerations about the overall\nimplausibility of the hypothesis. What may not be reasonable is the\nfact that people with delusions hang onto their delusions even when\nthey keep gathering evidence against it, that is, the delusional\nbelief is not correctly updated in the light of new information. The\nauthors argue that the information undermining the delusional\nhypothesis does not present itself as disconfirming evidence to the\nperson with the delusion. Thus, the new evidence is interpreted in the\nlight of the delusion and confabulation is used to fill the gaps. The\nbehaviour of the person with the delusion is not very different from\nthat of an obstinate scientist refusing to see that the new data\nundermines the support for the theory she is deeply committed to.\n\nMcKay 2012 offers some criticism of the account by Coltheart and\ncolleagues, and raises the following points among others: (1) it is\nnot a perfectly rational response to adopt the delusional hypothesis\nas an explanation for the unusual data, unless the probability of the\ndelusional hypothesis before the unusual data is gathered is very\nhigh, and this is implausible given the content of some delusional\nhypotheses (\u201cmy wife has been replaced by an almost identical\nimpostor\u201d); (2) factor two as described by Coltheart and\ncolleagues (i.e., a failure to update a belief in the light of\nconflicting evidence) cannot precede factor one or be acquired at the\nsame time as factor one, because such a form of conservatism would\nprevent the person from adopting the delusional hypothesis in the\nfirst place. McKay\u2019s positive account is that factor two is not\na bias towards conservatism (which causes new data conflicting with\nthe delusional hypothesis to be discounted), but a bias towards\nexplanatory adequacy (which causes the delusional hypothesis\nto be adopted and maintained because it fits the abnormal data so\nwell). McKay also argues that his account is compatible with\nprediction-error theories of delusion formation:\n\nAn excess of prediction error signal is what underpins the bias\ntowards explanatory adequacy. Prediction error signals are triggered\nby discrepancies between the data expected and the data encountered.\nSuch signals render salient the unexpected data and initiate a\nrevision of beliefs to accommodate these data. If there is an excess\nof prediction error signal, inappropriately heightened salience is\nattached to the data, and belief revision is excessively\naccommodatory \u2013 biased towards explanatory adequacy. (McKay 2012,\np. 18)\n\n\nThe debate is reviewed by Davies and Egan 2013 who helpfully focus on\nthe distinction between the adoption and the maintenance of the\ndelusional hypothesis and argue that there is no need to postulate an\nadditional reason why we hang on to our delusions (either a bias\ntowards conservatism or empirical adequacy). Once the delusional\nhypothesis is adopted as an explanation for or an endorsement of the\nunusual data, it is correct from a Bayesian point of view that it will\nnot be updated or revised due to a conflict with previous beliefs. New\nevidence would be necessary to prompt an update or a revision. That\nsaid, a critical evaluation of the maintenance of the delusional\nhypothesis can still be made because the delusional belief was formed\nas prepotent doxastic response to unusual data and thus it is likely\nto be compartmentalised. As Davies and Egan themselves acknowledge,\nthe application of idealised models of inference such as Bayesianism\nis somehow limited in the examination of actual belief systems. Even\nwhen no pathology is present, biases affecting the adoption and\nevaluation of hypotheses are going to be the (statistical) norm, which\nmakes it difficult to uniquely identify the problem with the adoption\nand the persistence of delusional beliefs.\n\nAlthough delusions can be irrational to a higher degree than normal\nbeliefs, as they may be less consistent with our other beliefs and\nbehavior and more resistant to counterevidence, they do not seem to be\nirrational in a qualitatively different way from nondelusional beliefs. This\nwould suggest that there are elements of continuity between delusions\nand irrational beliefs, although (as we shall see in the next section)\nthere exist sophisticated philosophical arguments challenging the\ncontinuity claim.\n",
