He takes himself to have established that we need to have\npossible worlds of some kind in our ontology, but not that these\npossible worlds must be concrete. In particular, they can be abstract,\nor what he calls \u201cersatz\u201d possible worlds. Lewis does not\nhave a single knock-down argument against all forms of ersatzism.\nInstead he divides the space of possible ersatzist positions into\nthree, and launches different attacks against different ones.\n\nLewis starts with what he calls \u201clinguistic ersatzism\u201d.\nThis is the view that ersatz possible worlds are representations, and\nthe way they represent possibilities is something like the way that\nlanguage represents possibilities. In particular, they represent\npossibilities without resembling possibilities, but instead in virtue\nof structural features of the representation.\n\nHe levels three main objections to linguistic ersatzism. First, it\ntakes modality as a primitive, rather than reducing modality to\nsomething simpler (like concrete possible worlds). Second, it\ncan\u2019t distinguish qualitatively similar individuals in other\npossible worlds. Lewis argues that will mean that we can\u2019t\nalways quantify over possibilia, as we can in his theory. Third, it\ncan\u2019t allow as full a range of \u2018alien\u2019, i.e.\nuninstantiated, natural properties as we would like. Sider (2002) has\nreplied that some of these challenges can be met, or at least reduced\nin intensity, if we take the pluriverse (i.e. the plurality of worlds)\nto be what is represented, rather than the individual worlds.\n\nThe second theory he considers is what he calls \u201cpictoral\nersatzism\u201d. This is the view that ersatz possible worlds are\nrepresentations, and the way they represent possibilities is something\nlike the way that pictures or models represent possibilities. That is,\nthey represent by being similar, in a crucial respect, to what they\nare representing. The pictoral ersatzist, says Lewis, is caught in\nsomething of a bind. If the representations are not detailed enough,\nthey will not give us enough possibilities to do the job that possible\nworlds need to do. If they are detailed enough to do that job, and\nthey represent by resembling possibilities, then arguably they will\ncontain as much problematic ontology as Lewisian concrete possible\nworlds. So they have the costs of Lewis\u2019s theory without any\nobvious advantage.\n\nThe final theory he considers is what he calls \u201cmagical\nersatzism\u201d. Unlike the previous two theories, this theory is\ndefined negatively. The magical ersatzist is defined by their denial\nthat possible worlds represent, or at least that they represent in\neither of the two ways (linguistic and pictoral) that we are familiar\nwith. And Lewis\u2019s primary complaint is that this kind of theory\nis mysterious, and that it could only seem attractive if it hides from\nview the parts of the theory that are doing the philosophical work.\nLewis argues that as soon as we ask simple questions about the\nrelationship that holds between a possibility and actuality if that\npossibility is actualised, such as whether this is an internal or\nexternal relation, we find the magical ersatzist saying things that\nare either implausible or mysterious.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear just who is a magical ersatzist. Lewis wrote that\nat the time he wrote Plurality no one explicitly endorsed\nthis theory. This was perhaps unfair to various primitivists\nabout modality, such as Adams (1974), Plantinga (1974) and Stalnaker\n(1976). Given the negative definition of magical ersatzism, and given\nthe fact that primitivists do not think that possible worlds represent\npossibilities via any familiar mechanism, it seems the primitivists\nshould count as magical ersatzists, or, as Lewis calls them,\n\u201cmagicians\u201d. In any case, if magical ersatzism, in all its\nvarieties, is objectionably mysterious, that suggests ersatzism is in\ntrouble, and hence if we want the benefits of possible worlds, we have\nto pay for them by accepting concrete possible worlds.\n",
