A first step in these research practices is\noften to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for\ndata sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of\nexperimental datasets (Leonelli 2016). For instance, the search for\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n started with the development of network models based on data\ndownloaded from the database RegulonDB as well as other sources\n(Shen-Orr et al. 2002). Numerous databases, bio-ontologies, and\nsoftware tools have been developed, emphasizing the ideals of Open\nData and large-scale collaborative efforts (Leonelli 2013). These\npractices raise questions as to whether some projects within systems\nand synthetic biology may be described as \u2018big science\u2019\n(Vermeulen 2010), and about the epistemic and social implications of\ndata-intensive research practices and collaborations.\n\nOne debated issue is the extent to which big data will radically\nchange or even revolutionize scientific methods, shifting the focus\nfrom hypothesis-driven inquiry to data-driven discoveries (Mazzocchi\n2015). Whereas some have seen data-intensive strategies as a\ntheory-free approach (Allen 2001), others have argued that\ntheory\u00a0plays different, although not less important, roles in\ndata-intensive science (Leonelli 2016). In particular, big data\nbiology presents new opportunities for eliminative inferences and\nexploratory experiments (Ratti 2015). Moreover, since the aim of\nbio-ontologies is to provide a standardized language and repository\nfor shared information, choices concerning vocabulary and\ncategorizations become important philosophical topics, including\nwhether standardization is compatible with local data uses (Leonelli\n2016). Important philosophical questions include how choices\nconcerning collection, sampling, standardization, visualization, and\ninterpretation of data affect the result of the analysis.\nSpecifically, the results of correlation-based methods such as GWAS\nare sensitive to sampling procedures and specific statistical\nthresholds, and the clinical validity and utility of genetic\nbiomarkers is a debated issue (e.g., Hey 2015; Maher 2008; McPherson\nand Tybjaerg-Hansen 2016).\n\nFinally, data-intensive practices also have implications for the\ninstitutional organization of science, as exemplified by the push for\nopen access on one hand and commercial interests in big data on the\nother (Calvert & Frow 2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b; Leonelli 2013,\n2014; Royal Society 2012; Vermeulen 2011). Data are often produced and\ncompiled without specific aims in mind and are used and reused for\nmultiple purposes, and scholars have stressed the need to reconsider\nthe relation between data and evidence, and between basic and applied\nscience. Moreover, as contexts for ownership of data change, also\nreward-systems in terms of authorship and credits may need to be\nreconsidered (Ankeny & Leonelli 2015).\n",
