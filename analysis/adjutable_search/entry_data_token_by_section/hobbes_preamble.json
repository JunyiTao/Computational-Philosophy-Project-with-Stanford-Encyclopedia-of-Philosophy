    "main_text": "\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679), whose current reputation rests\nlargely on his political philosophy, was a thinker with wide-ranging\ninterests. In philosophy, he defended a range of materialist,\nnominalist, and empiricist views against Cartesian and Aristotelian\nalternatives. In physics, his work was influential on Leibniz, and led\nhim into disputes with Boyle and the experimentalists of the early\nRoyal Society. In history, he translated Thucydides\u2019 History\nof the Peloponnesian War into English, and later wrote his own\nhistory of the Long Parliament. In mathematics he was less successful,\nand is best remembered for his repeated unsuccessful attempts to\nsquare the circle. But despite that, Hobbes was a serious and\nprominent participant in the intellectual life of his time.\n",
