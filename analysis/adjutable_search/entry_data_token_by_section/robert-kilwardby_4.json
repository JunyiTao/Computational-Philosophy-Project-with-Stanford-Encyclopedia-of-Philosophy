Here, Kilwardby argues that for\nan act of perception to occur, certain requirements need to be met:\nthere needs to be an object, a sense organ, and a medium between them;\nthe object must issue/generate a likeness (image or species) of itself\nby means of which it can be known (since nothing in the world can be\nknown except by generating a species of itself). The likeness must be\nable to change the medium and then the sense organ. Both the medium\nand the sense organ, in different ways, must be appropriate to the\nlikeness, that is, must be receptive of it. In the case of sight, for\ninstance, the medium must be transparent, and there must be light (E\n5, 42).\n\nThe change in medium is different from that in the sense organ, and\ndifferent species seem to move (in) the medium in different ways.\nKilwardby connects this with the materiality and even the different\ndegrees of materiality of the species: the species of smell and\nhearing move with the airwaves, whereas the species of color do\n not.[11]\n With respect to sight\u2014the prototypical sense discussed in\nmedieval theories of perception\u2014the object, according to the\nrules of optics, must stand opposite the perceiver\u2019s eyes, and the\nspecies move along a straight line. There are two objects of sight:\nlight and color; but whereas color (and by means of it the colored\nthing) is that which is perceived, light is that which makes this\nperception possible (QLIII2S 5, 18). Light is not perceived as such;\nonly the mind (not the sensory soul) is able to distinguish light from\ncolor, by reflection (QLIII2S 26, 190).\n\nIn DSF 103, Kilwardby provides a careful synthesis of the process of\nperception, which can be described in terms of the two\nmotions\u2014outwards and inwards:\n\n\nFor there are two things in sensing, namely, the more attentive action\nof the soul in the body which is acted upon, and the perception of\nthis action. (trans. Broadie)\n\n\nThe acted-upon refers to the affection (passio) of the sense\norgans by the sensible object, more precisely, the impressing of the\nlikeness of the object (the sensible species) in the sense organ. This\naffection is a certain kind of alteration through which a disposition\nis perfected\u2014in other words, the potentiality of the sense organ\nto receive a certain quality is actualized (DSF 61\u201362).\n\nThe attentive action is the sensory soul\u2019s assimilating\nitself to the species received in the sense organ, and by means of\nthis assimilation makes in and from itself (DSF 126) an image or\nlikeness of the sensible species (DSF 166; 121; 185). It is by means\nof this assimilative action that the image of the sensible object\ncomes into being in the sensory soul. The sensory soul (not the\nintellective, DSF 140) forms the image as if by natural instinct\n(instinctu naturali), that is, it has a natural capacity to\ndo it (DSF 128).\n\nFinally, the perception of the soul\u2019s action is \u201cto sense in\nitself the image which it has formed in itself\u201d (or, \u201cthe\nturning of the eye <of the soul> upon itself, in and by\nmeans of which the image is sensed\u201d (DSF 125), that is, the\nperception of the object. In other words, the sensory soul turns its\neye upon itself and sees the sensible object through the image made by\nitself. It does not distinguish the image in the sense organ from the\nimage in itself (DSF 104), and neither image is that which is\nperceived. The object of perception is the external thing (DSF\n110\u201311) and not the image by which the thing is known (quo\nres cognoscitur) (QLIS 89, 280).\n\nAccording to Kilwardby, the soul is the active element in the process\nin that perception is possible due to the soul\u2019s intentional state\nwith respect to the affection of the organ. The reason the soul\npermanently attends to the body and its affections is that it is\nproper for the soul, as the form of the body, to take care of the\nwell-being and preservation of the body (DSF 100\u2013101; Silva\n2008). The soul avoids all affections that can injure and damage the\nbody and its organs, which are the soul\u2019s instruments for acquiring\ninformation about the external world. The soul\u2019s control over the body\nis exercised through the mediation of the corporeal sensitive spirit,\nmade of fine\n matter.[12]\n\nWhen human beings sleep, the sense organs continue to be impressed by\nthe species from sense objects; however, this impression, without the\nattention of the soul, does not give rise to any act of perception\n(DSF 203; Silva 2010), and it is arguable whether on these occasions\nthe image in the soul is actually made.\n\nThe theory raises the question about the correspondence between the\nimage made by the soul in imitating one received in the sense organs\nrather than by taking in the species of the external thing. Kilwardby\ndismisses that hypothetical objection by claiming that the sensory\nsoul is from the outset endowed with such a capacity and by restating\nthat the image does correspond to the external object.\n\nThe process includes a physically based account\u2014the generation\nof the species (which have different degrees of materiality), its\npropagation through the medium, and its affection of sense\norgans\u2014and a spiritual/immaterial account that explains what\nfollows from the affection of the sense organ by the species.\nAccording to this second account, the soul reacts to this affection\nand makes the image of the object. It is this image that remains in\nmemory, available for acts of imagination.\n\nKilwardby insists at great length on denying any efficient causality\nto the object, that is, he refuses to take perceptual acts as being\ncaused by the external object or its species. The object is the\nnecessary occasion and the causa sine qua non (otherwise\nthere would be nothing to be perceived) but not the sufficient cause\nof perception (DSF 103; 123). The efficient cause per se of perception\nis the immaterial soul\u2014the division into sensory faculties is\ninstrumental to the process and in most of this part of the treatise\nKilwardby talks of the operations of the sensory soul (which he also\ncalls the \u2018incorporeal sensitive spirit\u2019) as a unified\nentity.\n\nKilwardby\u2019s theory of sense perception is, on the one hand,\nAristotelian because he accepts that our knowledge of the world\noriginates in sense experience; he describes the process of perception\nas a being-affected. On the other hand, it is Augustinian because he\nlimits the efficient role of the object to the affection of the sense\norgans; he takes the soul to be the true efficient cause of\nperception, reacting to the body\u2019s being affected and making in and\nfrom itself the images of exterior objects; he grounds his theory on\nthe ontological assumption of a hierarchy of being where only things\nat the same or higher level can affect each other, which forbids the\naction of anything corporeal upon something incorporeal. The body\nfeels through the soul (and the soul through itself) because, as to\nfeel is a kind of being-affected, the body cannot affect the soul, but\nthe soul can affect the body.\n\nAlthough much of his account of perception is made in terms of the\nsensory soul and its operations and less in terms of faculty\npsychology, it emerges from Kilwardby\u2019s account that a major cognitive\nrole is assigned to memory\u2014a primacy found also in intellectual\ncognition (where memory represents God, the Father, in the analogy of\nthe powers of the mind and in the Divine Trinity (see especially QLIS\n35\u201337)). Contrasting Aristotle\u2019s and Augustine\u2019s views on\nmemory, Kilwardby argues that the power of memory is responsible for\nreceiving the images of objects of knowledge by natural assimilation,\nfor preserving the images of sensible objects, and for making them\navailable for the powers of imagination (sensory memory) and intellect\n(intellectual memory) (QLIS 62, 181). Kilwardby distinguishes between\na sensory memory and a rational memory, further divided into inferior\n(dedicated to sensible things) and superior (dedicated to the\nintelligible objects) (QLIS 62, 179). The rational memory (the Father)\ngenerates understanding by presenting the intelligible species to the\nintellect (the Son; see QLIS 35; 37; QLIIS 77, 213\u2013214).\nUnderstanding is a form of a vision of an image generated by rational\nmemory, in the same way as an object generates an image of itself\n(QLIS 35). In both cases, the soul has, in the first moment, the image\nand in the second moment turns its eye (of the sensory soul and of the\nmind) to see (know) the object.\n5.2. Intellectual Cognition\n\nFollowing Grosseteste, Kilwardby took human knowledge to comprise the\ncomprehension of the truth of contingently existing things, of what\nfrequently is in the same way, and of what has an absolute way of\nbeing and is immutable\u2014such as the principles and conclusions of\na demonstration. Of these, the highest type of knowledge is that found\nin the conclusion of a demonstration (NLP I.5, 31\u201332).\n\nAlthough we can know particular objects by means of perception, there\nis scientia only of what always is in the same way (NLP I.10,\n48), that is, of what is eternal and incorruptible; in other words,\nscientia is about universals.\n5.2.1. Universals\n\nThe knowledge of universals is reached through induction from the\nknowledge of singulars received through the senses (NLPA 171; DOS\n196). Kilwardby describes the process in the following way: sensible\nspecies are retained in the absence of a sensible thing by memory, and\nfrom a multitude of memories arises experience, that is, a first\ncomparison of what is common to the species, not yet a universal. The\nintellect is then able to discover the essential likeness\n(essentialis similitudo) or common nature (ratio\nuniuersalis) in which the sense data agree (NLP II.33,\n503\u2013504; DOS 7\u20138; NLPA 171\u20132). The universal is,\nthen, the essential reason for agreement of many images of the same\nnature (QLIIS 78, 222.236\u20138; QLIIS 17, 71; Lewry 1978, 244).\n\nIn NLPor, Kilwardby describes the process of abstraction as the\ninteraction of two aspects of the intellect: the agent intellect\nabstracts the intelligible species (species intelligibiles)\nfrom the images of sensible things acquired through sense perception.\nThe intelligible species are then deposited in the possible intellect\n(Lewry 1978, 241), which is bare or naked (nudus) previous to\nthis reception (QLIS 4, 12; QLIS 35, 83 and in DSF 14).\n\nThe universal is at rest in the soul, as it is the ratio\ncommon to all those particulars which instantiate it (NLP 33,\n504\u2013505). Kilwardby argues that Peter and Paul differ as\nindividuals (they have their own matter and form), but they have\nsomething in common\u2014their essence. Universals are, therefore,\nthis agreement (convenientia) in essence. Two human beings\nagree essentially agreeing in their humanity when that humanity is\nconsidered not as individuated in this or that human being, but as\nabstracted from any concrete individual (QLIIS 17, 71). The universal\nis one thing (res una) not in the sense of being numerically\none (an individual thing) but in the sense of being a unity of\nagreement or likeness of individual things outside the mind (QLIIS 17,\n72).\n\nIt is this idea (together with individuation) that constitutes the\nbasis for Kilwardby\u2019s criticism of Averroes\u2019 monopsychism\u2014a\ntheory he qualifies as being against faith and philosophy as well as\ncontrary to Aristotle\u2019s intention (QLIIS 78, 216). Averroes had argued\nfor his theory that there is only one soul (una anima numero)\ncommon to all human beings with the contention (among others) that the\nunity of the representative species requires the unity of the soul\n(QLIIS 78,\n 215).[13]\n Kilwardby argues against this idea, by claiming that the different\nlikenesses present in different souls are one only in species (QLIIS\n78, 221), in the same way as individual human beings, such as Plato\nand Socrates, correspond as species, that is, as human beings, not as\nindividuals. Those likenesses are numerically multiple according to\nthe multiplicity of souls in which they are received, but they\ncorrespond to each other in being representations of one and the same\nthing, for example, Plato (QLIIS 78, 218\u2013219; see also QLIIS 17,\n71). The same is valid for the universal, which is abstracted from\nmany similar likenesses, such as the likenesses of Socrates and Plato.\nIt is also (incidentally) multiplied according to the multiplicity of\nintellects in which it exists. It is one only in species as the\nratio in which the many likenesses of the same nature\nessentially agree (QLIIS 78, 222).\n\nTherefore, sense perception and intellectual cognition are\ncomplementary. Even though there are intelligible things that are not\nsensory, all sensory things are intelligible (DOS 430\u2013431): they\nare known by the senses as particulars and ordered towards further\nintellectual cognition (DOS 433). \u201cSensation is\u201d,\nKilwardby says, \u201cthe gate to human cognition\u201d, because\nthere can be no knowledge of universals (and demonstration) without\nthe knowledge of particulars (NLP I.33, 509; DOS 433).\n\nHuman knowledge proceeds from that which is acquired through the\nsenses, i.e., particular intentions, to the knowledge of that which is\nmore distant from the senses (DOS 627), that is, the common intentions\n(communes raciones siue communes intenciones) which are\nabstracted from them (QLIII1S 44, 189; see also see Lewry Por, 360).\nAlthough acts of perception are about singular objects, it is by means\nof sense perception that cognition of universals is accomplished (by\nabstraction of those individuating circumstances) (NLP II.33, 505):\none perceives Callias, but we cognize Callias not as an individual\nhuman being but qua human being as such. But one needs to\nproceed from what is better known to us (that is, that which is\nimmediate in sense perception, the singular thing) to what is better\nknown by nature or more removed from the senses (DOS 238; see also NLP\nI.7, 39; NSLP 18, 139\u2013140), as scientific knowledge is not about\nthe particular object immediately perceived but the universal (DOS\n436). We come to perceive first universals, then particulars, as when,\nat a distance, we perceive first a body, then that it is an animated\nbody, then that it is an animal, and finally that it is this\nparticular animal\u2014it must be said, though, as Avicenna points\nout (says Kilwardby), that what is perceived in this process is a\nconfused universal (universale confusum), i.e., a universal\n\u201cfused together\u201d, as it were, (to use Peter King\u2019s happy\nliteral translation) with a particular (NSLP 18; see also NLP I.7, 40;\nNLPor 11, M 9vb).\n\nAccording to Kilwardby, universals exist, having different modes, in\nand outside the mind (QLIIS 78, 218). The universal is one over many\n(unum preter multa) according to its own essence\n(secundum suam essentiam), but it exists in the many as\ntheir essence (secundum esse) (NLP 33,\n504\u2013505). For him, a universal on account of its being universal\n(secundum rationem qua universale est), can be\nconsidered:\n\n\n(i)\nas existing in many individual things (secundum concretionem\net esse suum in multis). Everything that exists outside the soul\nis either an individual, or it exists in an individual (QLIIS 17, 64),\nthus universals exist through and in individuals (QLIIS 18, 76; QLIIS\n17, 70). Universals are corruptible incidentally, as their\ninstantiations are corruptible (NSLPery I.2; NLP 21,\n123\u20134).\n(ii)\naccording to its essence, in abstraction from the many\n(secundum essentiam sive abstractionem a multis), that is,\nexisting in the mind through abstraction from the individual things\n(QLIIS 78, 221; Lewry Por, 360; QLIIS 18, 74; DOS 10; 201; see also\nPich\u00e9 2002). As such, the universal exists only in the\nintellect (est tantum opus intellectus et in intellectu tantum et\nnon extra). The form is the same per essentiam, but its\nbeing (esse) is different (DOS 200), as the universal is\nseparable (by abstraction) from an individual thing according to\nintellectual being, but not in its natural, real being (NSLPor 7; NLP\nII.33, 504\u20135).\n\n\n\nIn a clear expression of his realist commitment, Kilwardby points out\nthat universals are not fictions of the mind: they are found in\nindividual existing things as their essences; otherwise there would be\nno univocal predication or definition, and science would be about\nfictions of the mind (QLIIS 17, 69; 73). Universals can be said of\nmany because they exist in the many that exemplify them (QLIIS 78,\n220).\n\nIt is important to notice that Kilwardby rules out the association of\nuniversals with divine ideas, as essences of things separate from\nmatter, as Plato claimed (ut Plato posuit). For him, such\nideas have no role in human cognition. In NSLPor 2 (M 2vb), he states\nthat universals exist in God\u2019s mind as exemplary and formal causes,\nbut science is about universals that exist in and are abstracted from\nindividual things; thus, the ideas (ydee) that exist in God\u2019s\nmind from eternity are of no use to science (NLP I.36,\n230\u2013231).\n\nAs Kilwardby frequently remarks, following Aristotle\u2019s dictum\nin the Metaphysics, human beings have a natural desire for\nknowledge (DOS 6): Omnes homines natura scire desiderant.\nKnowledge or more properly scientific knowledge (scientia) is\ndefined as the knowledge of the conclusion of a demonstrative\nsyllogism (based on Aristotle\u2019s doctrine in the Posterior\nAnalytics). As many other authors of the period, Kilwardby\ndistinguishes between the understanding of the principles\n (intellectus),[14]\n and the knowledge of the conclusion\n (scientia).[15]\n5.2.2. Truth\n\nTruth, Kilwardby says, is an equivocal notion: the truth\n(ueritas) of a thing is the thing\u2019s being (esse),\nthat is, what the thing genuinely is (NSLPery I.2, M 46vb; see also\nNSLP 17, 130), namely, its essence or quiddity (essentia vel\nquidditas) that is signified by its definition (QLIS 44,\n 141).[16]\n Things themselves, and the forms or intentiones through\nwhich things come to be known, lack any composition, that is, they are\nneither affirmed nor denied, and therefore they are not true or false\nas are declarative sentences (NSLPery, p. 16. See also NSLP 17, 124).\nTruth is the correspondence of the thing and concept (adequatio\nrei et intellectus), a definition Kilwardby takes from Avicenna\n(NSLPery\n I.9).[17]\n\nAs the intellect is able to consider separately things that are\ntogether and to separate things that are not together in reality,\ntruth and falsity have to do with the composition and division of the\nspecies of things in the soul and not in extramental\n things.[18]\n That is to say, \u2018the composition and division that thought\nbrings about must have reference to the being and not-being of things\noutside\n thought\u2019.[19]\n Complex expressions are true in cases in which they conform to the\nway the things are outside the combining mind, and they are signified\nby the terms\u2014the predicate and\n subject.[20]\n The intentions (intentiones or passiones animae) in\nthe soul and their combinations exist in the soul as signs\n(signa) of extra-mental things.\n\nAlthough the logician is not primarily concerned with the way things\n are,[21]\n he must know how they are in order to make statements that are true\nwith respect to the being of things outside the composing and dividing\nmind (DOS 521), because logic does not teach how to reason in a\nfictional mode (DOS 578). The one that combines or divides must know\nthe properties or modes of things in which things themselves agree or\ndisagree (DOS 577).\n\nAccording to a common conception of truth, for a proposition to be\ntrue, the actual existence of what is signified by its terms is\nrequired; however, terms can also be considered without this\ncorrespondence to something existing outside the mind(LPA I.18,\n388-95). In NSLPery (I.7) Kilwardby considers the case of the\nchimera:\n\n\nBut it must be said that when I say that every statement is something\nof something, this \u2018something\u2019 is taken in a common way,\neither as something in speech only or in reality: thus when non being\nis stated in reality, it is a statement about being at least in\ndiscourse, as when one talks about chimeras or such\n things.[22]\n\n\nA chimera corresponds at least to something in speech or in the\ncomposing mind, even if not to something in the extra-mental\n world.[23]\n The word \u2018chimera\u2019 signifies what exists only in the\nsoul; therefore, its definition shows not the essence of a thing (as\nthere are no extra-mental things such as chimeras) but what the name\nsignifies (NLP II.7, 381\u2013382).\n\nThe actual existence of things outside the soul is not always required\nfor a (affirmative) proposition (here understood as a statement-making\nsentence) to be true (NLP II.7, 381). Nonbeing can be understood as\nbeing not yet actual but in potency only, that is, that has an\naptitude to exist in\n actuality.[24]\n About those things that can but do not yet exist outside the soul,\nexistence is taken to refer to the (common) nature and not to the\nindividual (NLP II.7, 379): when animal is predicated of human being\nor when one says that an eclipse is the privation of light, it is not\nnecessary to know whether or not this is actually the case because a\nhuman being is always an animal, and an eclipse cannot be but the\nprivation of light. Thus, even if no human being actually existed\noutside the soul, even then the proposition \u2018homo est\nanimal\u2019 would still be true (NLP II.7, 381).\n5.2.3. Signs\n\nKilwardby classifies signs into\n\n\n(i)\nnatural signs, for example, smoke is a sign of fire and redness a\nsign of heat, and\n(ii)\ngiven signs; these divide into\n\n\n(ii\u2032)\nsigns that have a likeness of the thing signified\u2014these\ndivide further into\n\n\n(ii\u2032*)\nthose which are signs of something else, as spoken words are signs\nof the affections of the soul and the affections of things;\n(ii\u2032**)\nthose which are signs of invisible grace, such as the sacraments\n(QLIVS 42, 225\u201326)\n \n(ii\u2033)\nsigns that do not have a likeness of the thing signified.\n \n\n\n\nOf those signs that are signs of something else (ii\u2032*), some\nsignify by convention (ad placitum, which Kilwardby proves by\ntheir not being the same for everybody); others signify naturally\n(like the sounds of non-rational animals). Of those words that signify\nby convention, some are simple expressions, and others are complex\nexpressions (oratio or enuntiatio). Only\nsignificative complex expressions are true or false; simple\nexpressions are neither true nor false (NSLPery I.2).\n\nSignifying by convention is the result of an original (voluntary)\nimposition of a significatum upon a word, primarily conceived\nof as a spoken word (vox) \u2013 a modulated sound (DOS 488;\nsee also QLIVS 42,\n 224).[25]\n A word signifies the passio mentis and the thing outside the\nsoul (QLIVS 11, 47). Spoken words signify primarily the passio\nanimi (or species intelligibilis or\nintellectus; Lewry Pery, 289) and signify things via thoughts\n(uoces sunt note intellectuum, et sic rerum) (QLIS 144, 143).\nThe passio, being a likeness of a thing in the\nmind\u2014received rather than made by us\u2014is common to all\nhuman beings (LPA ed. 1516, 82rb).\n\nKilwardby argues that only human beings proffer meaningful utterances\nbecause, as Priscian points out, the articulate vocal sound (uox\narticulata) uttered by humans is tied together\n(copulata) with a sensus mentis or\nintellectus in the mind of the speaker; thus only beings that\nhave minds can produce significative\n utterances.[26]\n Moreover, the production of the vox litterata requires the\ncontrol of the modulation of sounds\u2014what Kilwardby calls the\nfigure in the air (through which the utterances are\ntransmitted)\u2014on a regular basis, that is, always the same figure\nfor the same word. This is done by the sensory soul under the control\nof the rational soul (NLPA, 124\u2013125). This explains not only why\nmeaningful articulate vocal sounds are signs but also their primacy as\nefficiently caused by the soul (see Mora-M\u00e1rquez 2014).\n\nThere are, therefore, two aspects of spoken language: on the one hand,\nthe vox, as an articulate sound, causes a natural change in\nboth the medium and the ear of the one who hears it (DOS 147; NLPA\n127\u2013128); on the other, the utterance, as something heard,\nbrings about an act of the intellect of the listener (DOS 425; NSLPery\nI.1). To speak (dicere) in the proper sense means expressing\nthe likeness of a thing in order to make known that of which it is the\nlikeness (QLIS 37, 106). In that sense, a meaningful utterance should\nbe called \u2018nota\u2019 with respect to the speaker, because it\nrefers to the meaning conveyed by the speaker (the species\nintelligibilis), and it should be called \u2018signum\u2019\nwith respect to the one who hears it, because it refers to the\nmaterial/sensitive aspect of the sign (NSLPery I.2; see Lewry 1978,\n289; Rosier 1994, 97\u201398; Marmo 1997, 139\u201340). As noted by\nRosier, Sirridge, and Kneepkens (see Bibliography), one of the main\ncontributions of Kilwardby (and Bacon and others in the intentionalist\ngrammatical tradition) is the emphasis on two levels of completeness\nof speech: one, concerning the word\u2019s modes of signifying and the\nother concerning the way the hearer understands or interprets the\nintention of the speaker (intentio proferentis).\n\nOne consequence of the conventional nature of language, according to\nwhich the relation between a sign and a significate is imposed on the\nsign by a voluntary act on the part of the impositor, is that\nthe change in what is signified by the sign does not require a change\nin the sign (NLPery I.1; Lewry 1981). On the other contrary, in the\ncase of natural signs, such as paleness from fear or redness from\nshame, the change in the thing signified implies a change of its\n sign.[27]\n5.2.4. Logic and Demonstrative science\n\nKilwardby adopts Robert Grosseteste\u2019s distinction between four main\nsenses of \u2018to know\u2019 (scire: (i) in a general sense, the\ncomprehension of the truth of contingent things, (ii) in a common\nsense, the comprehension of the truth of things that often are, (iii)\nproperly, the comprehension of the truth of things that are immutable,\n(iv) most properly, the comprehension of the truth of things that\nalways are the same and the truth of which depends on what is prior\n(NLP I.5; Silva 2012, 216; Corbini 2013, 166). So, whereas in a sense\nto know can be said of sense perception, it is properly and most\nproperly said of what is universal and of what is necessary (DOS 379).\nSuch knowledge is found in the premises/principles and above all in\nthe knowledge of the conclusions of demonstrations (iii and iv,\nabove). Scientific knowledge (scientia) is then more properly\ndemonstrative reasoning (DOS 381).\n\nA demonstration is a syllogism that brings about knowledge (NLP I.5,\n31). A syllogism is \u201can expression in which a conclusion follows\nof necessity when certain things have been asserted\u201d (DOS 493,\nKretzmann 1988, 265). The material principles of the syllogism are the\nthree terms (remote matter)\u2014the two extremes (major, minor) and\nthe middle\u2014combined into two premises (proximate matter). The\nconclusion is not part of the syllogism.\n\nA demonstration must have as starting-points appropriate principles\n(NLP I.19, 106\u20137): true, first, immediate, prior to, better\nknown than, and causes of the conclusion (NLP I.6, 34; DOS 503; 558).\nOf these conditions, to be true, first (or primitive), and immediate\nare the central ones: first because there is nothing prior to it in\nits kind\u2014otherwise the source of scientific knowledge rests on\nan infinite series of demonstrations (NLP I.8, 43; I.11, 53);\nimmediate because there is no medium between the subject and predicate\n(NLP 6, 38). Whereas to be true, first, and immediate are the\nqualifications that concern what the principles are in themselves (and\nthus the ones which belong to their definition), the others\u2014for\nexample, to be better known\u2014qualify the principles with respect\nto the conclusion (NLP I.8, 44; I.10, 49).\n\nKilwardby presents the following division of the first principles (NLP\nI.9, 45):\n\n\n(i)\ndignitates (axioms), principles common to all sciences,\nsuch as the principle of noncontradiction (De nullo eodem simul\naffirmatio et negatio) and the law of the excluded middle (De\nquodlibet affirmatio vel negatio\u2026) (DOS 584; NLP I.25,\n152). A dignitas does not require any external reason\njustifying it; it is immediately understood by the\n intellect;[28]\n(ii)\npositio, the principle proper to a particular science.\nAll particular sciences (scientie speciales) share the common\nfirst principles (communia principia), but they have their\nown set of first principles (propria principia; NLP 25, 152).\nThe positio further divides into suppositio, that\nis, a proposition that states of something that it is or it is not,\nand the diffinitio, that is, the definition of the\nsubject-matter of a science (QLIS 7, 18). A definition expresses the\nessence of a thing (NLP II.3, 346; QLIS 44, 141) and what is indicated\nby its name (NLP I.9, 45); it is not a proposition because it does not\nsay of something that it does or does not exist. Therefore, a\ndefinition enters into a demonstration as a part of a\nprinciple/premise (NLP I.9, 46).\n\n\n\nKilwardby denies (NLP II.33) that the first principles of\ndemonstration are innate or demonstrable. Kilwardby argues, instead,\nthat they are acquired from pre-existing sensory knowledge (NLP II.33,\n506). The knowledge of propositions must be preceded by the knowledge\nof the terms that enter into its composition, that is, what it is that\nis predicated and what the thing is of which something is predicated\n(NLP I.2, 16). By abstraction the intellect comes to know the\nuniversals that function as subject and predicate in syllogistic\npropositions.\n\nThese principles are known by themselves (sunt per se nota)\n(DOS 331; 503; QLIII2S 1, 7); our certitude of them, Kilwardby says,\ncomes from the \u2018light of truth\u2019 (QLIS 12, 31). It is by\nthe same light of truth that one assents to the principles/premises\nfrom the knowledge (notitia) of the terms that constitute\nthem as well as to the conclusion from the premises (NLP I.11, 54).\nThis act of assent is the result of some kind of illumination from the\nsoul\u2019s cognitive powers (QLIII2S 1, 7). The conclusion, he asserts, is\nthe terminus of the act of intellectual cognition, but the middle term\nis what makes it possible, just as light makes bodily seeing possible\n(QLIII2S 5, 18\u201320). One assents to the conclusion because one\ncomes to see how the middle term leads to the conclusion and makes the\nconclusion worthy of assent (QLIS 13, 33.2\u20133; see also DOS\n472).\n\nIn the highest type of demonstration, the potissima\ndemonstratio, the middle term is a causal definition (NLP II.3,\n343.12\u201314; DOS 527; LPA prologue) and the definition of the\npredicate (NSLP 6, 29; DOS 563). The middle term allows for the\ndemonstration of the predicate to belong per se et propter\nquid to the subject (NLP I.20, 117). The paradigmatic\ndemonstration is a syllogism of the first figure in the first mood,\nthat is with two universal premises because the relation of necessity\nbetween premises and conclusion is more evident (see Thom 2013,\n144-47).\n\nIt is not, however, enough for a principle of demonstration to be\ntrue; it must also be necessary. A necessary conclusion follows from\nnecessary premises (NLP I. 19, 110\u2013113). The kind of\nuniversality required for demonstration is not the same as that of a\nuniversal acquired through abstraction, which is said of many (ut\ndicatur de multis)\u2014the kind described in the\nPerihermeneias and in Porphyry\u2019s Isasoge\u2014but\nthe universal that must be said of all and always (de quodlibet et\nsemper et\n primo).[29]\n The kind of necessity Kilwardby has in mind is what applies to all\n(things under the subject), on account of what they are, and it is\nuniversal (de omni, per se, and universale)\n(NLP I.12, 62).\n\nThere must, however, exist a science whose aim is to discover and\nteach the method of how to investigate, through correct reasoning,\nwhat is not known from what is known. It cannot be metaphysics because\nthis science regards things apart from motion. A syllogism, however,\nis a kind of motion where the properties are deduced from the\nsubject(-matter) and the conclusion from the premises (NLP prologue,\n4). That science is logic. Since logic has the task of discovering a\nmethod of knowing that can be used by all sciences (LPA prologue),\nlogic is thought of as the modus scientiarum, or the science\nof sciences (scientia scientiarum). Proficiency in the way of\nreasoning allows for the discovery of truth in every field of inquiry\n(DOS 419), even though every science demonstrates according to the\npossibilities of its matter (NLP II.34, 512). In order to accomplish\nthis task, logic needs to teach how to combine one term with another\n(or divide one from another), the species of combinations and\ndivisions corresponding to the species of propositions or statements\n(DOS 517). Logic also relates things to one another by means of a\nmiddle term in the syllogism, which is logic\u2019s subject matter.\n\nThe different operations of the intellect producing different\nlinguistic units are studied in Aristotle\u2019s different logical works:\nthe simple significative expression (simplex sermo\nsignificativus or the dicibile sine complexione),\nsignificative of one of the ten genera of things, is the\nsubject-matter of the Categories; the declarative sentence\n(or the dicibile ordinatum cum dicibili interpretatione\nenuntiativa) is dealt with in the Perihermeneias; and\nthe syllogism (or the dicibile ordinatum cum dicibili in\ncomplexione duorum extremorum) in the Prior Analytics.\nThe syllogistic form\u2014which Aristotle presents in the Prior\nAnalytics\u2014can then be applied to any matter whatsoever,\nprobable or necessary (DOS 502). The Posterior Analytics\npresents the demonstrative syllogism, made of necessary matter; the\nTopics the dialectical syllogism of probable matter; and the\nSophistical Refutations deals with sophistical matter, i.e.,\nfallacious reasoning (DOS 503).\n\nNow, logic considers things in one of two ways: in terms of first\nintentions, that is, as the things themselves and thus belonging to\none of the ten highest kinds of being\u2014the categories; in terms\nof second intentions, that is, things as considered by the intellect\nand in respect to other things (DOS 459). They are called first and\nsecond because only after knowing things themselves can we consider\ntheir mutual relations (DOS 459): second intentions are about first\nintentions. \u2018Substance\u2019, \u2018quality\u2019, and such\nare names of first intentions, whereas \u2018universal\u2019,\n\u2018particular\u2019, \u2018to be an antecedent\u2019, \u2018to\nbe a consequent\u2019, and such are names of second intentions.\n\nKilwardby discusses second intentions in the context of a distinction\nhe proposes between reasoning as a subject of a discipline (logic) and\nas an instrument which is common to all disciplines (DOS 455; LT 39,\n125). Reasoning in one and the other case is the same from the point\nof form, since the moods and figures are the same; but it is different\nin respect to matter (probable and necessary, DOS 500\u2013504). As\nan instrument, reasoning is about things themselves\u2014those that\nbelong to their subject matters, such as lines and figures in\ngeometry\u2014because the subject matter of particular disciplines is\nthings (DOS 455; 477). By comparison, as the subject matter of logic,\nreasoning makes no reference to things themselves but to their\naccounts/reasons (rationes rerum), that is, the modes by\nmeans of which they are reasoned about (DOS 463). The logician is not\nconcerned primarily with things themselves, the res naturae\nor first intentions, but with the res rationis or second\nintentions; that is, he is not concerned with the things signified by\nthe subject and predicate terms of a proposition but with subject and\npredicate as such (QLIS 90; see also NSLP Prooemium, 4; 5, 20; Pini\n2002, 21\u201322).\n\nThings themselves \u2013 things that fall into one of the\ncategories\u2014are not in our soul, only their accounts\n(rationes) are (DOS 448\u201349). These modes or accounts\n(modi rerum sive rationes) are abstracted from things and\ncompared to each other as if they were the things themselves being\ncompared (DOS 451). It is the mode or account of things that makes it\npossible for us to reason about them (faciunt res\nrationalibes: DOS 450; rationes rerum et modi per quos res\nsunt rationabiles: DOS 463). Logic then considers the modi\nsive rationes rerum, the properties of things in so far as they\nare thought or compared to one another, which enables combining them\ninto propositions and demonstrations and arriving at scientific\nknowledge (scientia). (See DOS 449) Without the consideration\nof things together with the rationes rerum\u2014for example,\nthat \u2018divisible\u2019 is more universal than\n\u2018line\u2019\u2014no reasoning could be done about them (DOS\n450).\n\nReasoning needs to be considered as independently as possible from any\nparticular subject matter because logic examines the method of correct\nreasoning, which can then be taught and applied to all the other\nsciences (the syllogism simpliciter has matter, premises, and\nterms. In that sense, they can be replaced by transcendent matter,\nsuch as A, B, C; each particular science then replaces the terms with\nits own subject, properties, causes, and so on\u2014DOS 452. In that\nsense also, the syllogism simpliciter is not productive of\nknowledge or belief\u2014LPA prologue (see Thom 2013, 140).\n\nThus, Kilwardby\u2019s meaning of first and second intentions cannot be\nconfused with the meaning these terms acquire later on. His use of\nsecond intentions as proper to logic shows how he understands this\nnotion in the context of his theory of reasoning and of logic as being\nthe science of reasoning\u2014that is, it studies the process of\nreasoning in such a way that it can be used by all the other sciences\nas an instrument for the discovery of truth.\n6. The Classification of sciences in the De ortu Scientiarum\n\nKilwardby adopts a scheme of ordination for the different sciences or\ndisciplines, and it is largely based on the model of Hugh of St.\nVictor\u2019s Didascalicon: De studii legendi, a widely circulated\nand immensely influential work from the twelfth century on the\nclassification of sciences (see Silva 2013). As with the work of his\n(Augustinian) predecessor and notable influence, the DOS had a fame of\nits own and remains one of the most relevant medieval works of its\nkind.\n\nHugh\u2019s Didascalicon (itself inspired by previous\nclassifications\u2014see Weisheipl 1965) however only allows for\nKilwardby to include the sciences in what is called knowledge\u2014to\nthis he must (and does) add the principles of the division of the\ndifferent sciences into various fields of inquiry and then the\nclassification of the different sciences within a certain field of\ninquiry. Kilwardby goes beyond Hugh and previous classifications not\nso much with regard to the principles of division and classification,\nbut rather with regard to what is implied in science\u2014that is to\nsay, with regard to the necessary requirements for something to be\nconsidered scientific in a certain field of inquiry and process of\ndiscovery according to the Aristotelian deductive model of science.\nAny science (not\n art)[30]\n needs to fulfill three main requirements: first, it should have a\nsubject matter (DOS 167; 221); second, it should present the parts and\nspecies of a science\u2019s subject matter and their properties (DOS\n650\u2013652); third, it should take into account the first common\nprinciples of demonstration and have a set principles appropriated to\nits genus (NLP I.23).\n\nThe modus sciencie, according to the prologue of his NLPery,\n\u201cconsists of the speculation about the proven properties of the\nparts and species of the subject matter\u201d (Lewry Pery, 382; see\nalso NLP prologue; LT 50, 125), which is done by means of definition,\ndivision, and collection. By means of division one comes to know the\nsubject of a science; through collection or reasoning one comes to\nknow the properties of the parts and species of the subject; from\ndefinition, one comes to know the parts and species of the subject\n(DOS 524\u2013525; QLIS 7, 18\u201319).\n\nA major difficulty is whether one and the same\nscience\u2014metaphysics\u2014can have such two distinct objects as\nGod and creatures, still respecting the principle of the unity of\nscience (DOS 221; see also QLIS 4). In DOS 226 Kilwardby claims that\nunity by analogy is sufficient for the science of being qua being\n(scientia de ente), metaphysics, to be the field of inquiry\nthat has God and the creatures as objects of inquiry. Being and\nsubstance can be predicated by analogy of God and creatures: of God\nprimarily and properly, of creatures in a participative and less\nproper way. God cannot be known directly, but He can be known by means\nof His effects and by negation, in the same way our bodily eyes do not\nsee themselves except through a mirror (DOS 225).\n\nA major issue in the division and classification of disciplinary\nfields is the relation between subaltern sciences. In DOS 324\nKilwardby advocates three criteria for subalternation:\n\n\n(i)\nThe subject matter of the subaltern science falls under the\nsubject genus of the subject matter of the subalterning science.\n(ii)\nThe properties of the subject of a subaltern science can only be\nproven by means of the properties of the subject genus of the\nsubalterning science (DOS 330), by adding something of another genus\nin nature that is, however, somehow essential to the subalternate\nscience. For instance, the knowledge of \u2018triangle\u2019 and\n\u2018isosceles\u2019 belongs to one and the same science even\nthough \u2018isosceles\u2019 is something in addition to the\ngeometrical demonstrations of the properties of \u2018triangle\u2019\n(DOS 329).\n(iii)\nDemonstrations of subaltern sciences must be made within the same\nsubject genus of the subalterning science, that is, a property of\nsomething belonging to one genus cannot be demonstrated from a thing\nbelonging to another genus\u2014for example, a geometrical\nproposition demonstrated by means of arithmetic (NLP I.21, 120).\nMoreover, each subalterning science has a set of first principles that\nare used as starting points for all the subaltern sciences. For\nexample, the properties of numbers of harmony can only be known\nthrough the knowledge of the properties of number simpliciter\n(DOS 330).\n\n\n\nOne example of this subordination is found in the relation between the\nscience of geometry and its subordinate sciences. Geometry is the part\nof speculative philosophy dedicated to the study of limited magnitude\n(finite limited quantity abstracted from natural matter), its parts,\nand their properties (DOS 64\u201365). Astronomy and optics are two\nsuch subordinated sciences. Astronomy is a speculative science that\nhas as its object the magnitude of celestial bodies and the distance\nbetween them (DOS 72), whereas optics is defined as the speculative\nscience that has as its object the diverse modes of vision, focusing\non the nature of visual rays. It belongs to the genus that is the\nsubject matter of geometry because the visual rays propagate\nrectilinearly (DOS 77).\n\nKilwardby begins his text in a clarifying manner of distinguishing\nbetween those sciences that are about human words and actions and\nthose that are about what is divine (DOS 1; 654). The science of the\ndivine is theology, focused on the study of the Sacred Scripture. Of\nthe human sciences, some are commendable (philosophy), others vicious\nor illicit (magic). In DOS, Kilwardby is mostly concerned with the\nsciences of human invention. He further divides philosophy into\nspeculative\u2014the name that designates a group of sciences\nconstituted by physics, mathematics, and metaphysics\u2014and another\ngroup classified under the heading \u2018about human things\u2019,\nthat is, the results of human intentionality (QLIS 90, 286); it\nincludes the active sciences and the sciences of language. The former\ndivides into mechanics and ethics, the latter into grammar, logic, and\nrhetoric. Mathematics includes the sciences of the\nquadrivium, that is, the four sciences of things as they were\nknown in the Middle Ages (geometry, astronomy, music, and\narithmetic).\n\nScience, in the sense of knowledge, falls into one of three kinds: (i)\nthat which is primarily oriented to and necessary for salvation; (ii)\nthat which is useful in the search for truth and righteous\nliving\u2014for living an honest life\u2014but not sufficient for\nsalvation; (iii) that which is useless in both respects and is\nconnected with vanity (DOS 1\u20132). This grouping obeys a general\nprinciple, originated from Augustine, which sets up the direction for\nmedieval learning: knowledge must be directed towards virtue (DOS\n639). This same aspect is also present in the consideration of the\norder of the sciences, in which all sciences are preparatory to the\nscience of the higher end: all sciences are subordinated to, or at the\nservice of (famulantur), theology.\n\nKilwardby\u2019s criterion for classification is the object of the sciences\n(Alessio 2001, 108\u20139): \u201cscience must be divided according\nto the division of things about which it is\u201d (DOS 5). \u201cThe\ndiversity of sciences\u201d, he says, \u201cresults from the\ndiversity of their subject matters\u201d (DOS 108). Sciences are\norganized, as in the Boethian scheme, according to the level of\nabstraction of their objects of study from matter. Speculative\nsciences rank highest (DOS 203) and among them metaphysics.\nMetaphysics deals with being without qualification\n(simpliciter), whereas mathematics and physics deal with\nparticular kinds of being (DOS 323; NLP II.11, 417). Metaphysics\nconsiders substance and its principles \u2013 matter and form \u2013\nper se, that is, apart from change and privation, whereas physics\n(natural philosophy) considers substance as mutable and therefore\nmatter and form (and privation) as principles of change (DOS 232);\nmathematics deals with changeable material things but not insofar as\nthey are material, rather, insofar as they are abstracted from motion\n(within the sciences of the quadrivium, where the order is\nastronomy, geometry, harmony, and arithmetic).\n\nIn chapters 63 and 64, Kilwardby discusses different ways to consider\nthe order of the sciences: (i) the order of discovery, (ii) the\nnatural order, (iii) the ordering according to ends, (iv) the order of\nthe degree of certainty, and (v) the order of teachability.\n\nAccording to (i), the first among the (arts and) sciences are the\nmechanical arts because they result from the necessity to assist human\nbeings in surpassing their natural physical constraints (DOS 358).\nHuman beings are, in comparison with other animals, weaker in body,\nand therefore tend to devise forms to surpass this deficiency (DOS\n626); but they are gifted (by God) with reason to discover ways to\nsurpass their physical limitations (DOS 360\u201361). The\nsub-divisions of the mechanical arts obey the principles laid out in\nHugh of St. Victor\u2019s Didascalicon\u2014as Kilwardby himself\nmakes explicit (see DOS, chapters 37\u201339). Special attention must\nbe paid to the similarity between the scheme of the seven liberal arts\nand the seven mechanical arts that Hugh defends and Robert follows\n(DOS 363): as the liberal arts divide into trivium (sciences\nof language) and quadrivium (sciences of things) the\nmechanical arts also divide into a group of three arts concerning\nthose things related to what is external to the body (extrinsecus\ncorporis)\u2014clothing, weaponry (further divided into\narchitecture and industry), and navigation\u2014and a group of four\narts focusing on what is internal to the body (intrinsecus\ncorporis)\u2014agriculture, hunting, medicine, and theatre.\n\nNext comes speculative philosophy, and here the order is physics,\nmathematics, and metaphysics. This order is established on the basis\nof the proximity of each to the senses, from closest to most distant\n(DOS 627). The end of the speculative sciences is truth (DOS 394),\nthat is, to know the way of natural things according to their natures\n(DOS 405). Then comes ethics (DOS 628), the science that considers the\nhuman operations in connection with the mortal human body (DOS 404),\nfollowed by the sciences of speech/language, which have an order\nthemselves: grammar, rhetoric, and logic.\n\nKilwardby offers a two-fold consideration of logic, in a stricter and\nin a broader sense. In the broader sense, logic is a science of speech\n(scientia sermocinalis), dealing with correct expression,\nincluding grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic (logic in the strict\nsense). In the stricter sense, logic is the science of reasoning\n(scientia rationalis) (DOS 492). Logic is the science of\nreasoning because it considers and teaches the discovery of terms,\ntheir organization into complex expressions, and the combination of\ncomplex expressions into syllogistic demonstrations; but it is also\nthe science of speech because it deals with the linguistic expression\nof reasoning\u2014which does not remain, as Kilwardby says, hidden\n(inchoate) in the mind (DOS 578): mental words are about things,\nspoken words are about mental words, and written words are about\nspoken words (DOS 593).\n\nThe sciences of speech divide into those that are significative of\nwhat is known (grammar) and those that are inquisitive about what is\nnot known (logic and rhetoric) (DOS 468). Rhetoric differs from logic\nin that the former is about hypotheses and what is particular, whereas\nthe latter is about theses and what is universal\u2014its subject\nmatter is the syllogism and its species (DOS 468; 471; 474). By\ncontrast, rhetoric, as the science of speaking well, presupposes\ngrammar\u2014the science of signifying correctly (DOS 629). The\nsubject matter of grammar is significative speech qua significative\n(DOS 474), that is, the oratio and its parts insofar as they\nsignify or co-signify (DOS 489). Speech (sermo) here means\nthe human vox as it signifies by convention (ad\nplacitum) (DOS 488). Grammar considers the sentence from the\npoint of view of how well it is formed or its congruity\n(congruitas), which is the result of how its elements are\ncorrectly ordered to one another, rather than of the correspondence of\nthose words with the things they signify (NSLPery I.5). The end\n(finis) is to teach how to correctly express the conceptions\nof the mind (DOS 483\u201384; 490). Kilwardby\u2019s willingness to grant\na scientific role to grammar is notorious (Rosier 1994; Sirridge\n1988).\n\nNatural order (ii) is the order of the subject matter, that is, the\ndegree of abstraction: first the speculative sciences, then active\nsciences, and finally the sciences of language (DOS 630\u2013635).\n(According to this criterion, the order among the sciences of language\nis: grammar, logic, and rhetoric; this order is found already in the\nprologue of the NSLP).\n\nThe third type of order (iii) is the order of the end (finis)\nor the ends of the different sciences. Among the sciences, ethics is\nthe first from this point of view, followed by the speculative\nsciences, and then the sciences of language. (According to this\ncriterion, the order among the sciences of language is: logic,\nrhetoric, and grammar.) Speculative knowledge is ordered to ethics in\nthe same way as truth is ordered to the supreme good (DOS 405; see\nCelano 2013, 340).\n\nThe next criterion (iv) is according to the form or the degree of\ncertainty achieved. According to this, the first among the sciences\nare the speculative \u2013 and among them the highest\n(certior) is mathematics (NLP II.34, 512) \u2013 followed by\nthe active sciences \u2013 and here ethics is prior to mechanics.\n\nThe final criterion (v) is the order of teachability. According to\nthis ordering, the sciences of language come first\u2014and grammar\nfirst among them\u2014followed by the speculative and active\nsciences\u2014ethics first, then mechanics.\n\nTo conclude, Kilwardby\u2019s classification includes elements from\nprevious classifications, but the overall result is quite original:\n(i) the inclusion of logic, as a branch of science about human beings,\nwithin the active sciences; (ii) the Aristotelian inspired division\nbetween theoretical or speculative philosophy\u2014which encompasses\nphysics, mathematics, and metaphysics\u2014and practical\nphilosophy\u2014which comprises ethics and divides further into\nmonastic, economic, and political; (iii) the inclusion of the\nmechanical arts (from Hugh of St. Victor) within active or practical\nphilosophy.\n7. Celestial motion and time\n\nIn 1271, Kilwardby, together with Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great,\nreceived a questionnaire sent by the Master General of the Dominican\nOrder, John of Vercelli. The questionnaire, constituting 43 questions\nto be answered in a systematic order (forma taxata),\nsurveyed a wide range of theological problems, but the majority (25)\nwas concerned with the movement of the celestial bodies, its causes,\nand the possible influence upon the inferior (terrestrial) bodies. It\nincludes questions such as: Does God move any body immediately; if so,\nby a continuous everlasting movement, by a continuous but not\neverlasting movement, or by an instantaneous motion? (Q1) Are angels\nthe cause of the movement of the celestial bodies? (Q2)\n\nThe fifth question inquires about the cause of celestial motion.\nKilwardby considers three possible answers that he considers to be\neither (a) philosophically correct, (b) not to be approved either by\nphilosophy or by the saints, or (c) in agreement with philosophy.\n\n\n(a)\nAccording to Aristotle and others, celestial bodies are animate\nbeings that have intelligence and move by the power of will, in the\nsame way as human bodies are moved by their souls (D43Q 2, 14).\nKilwardby himself defends this view in his LSP and DOS (Lewry 1978,\n324\u20135; DOS 20).\n(b)\nCelestial bodies are moved by angels. Kilwardby dismisses this\nanswer by arguing that the motion of the celestial bodies needs to be\nnatural, in other words the principle of motion must be internal to\nthe thing moved (if the cause is external, the motion is violent)\n(D43Q 2, 12; see also E 2, 24\u201325). If angels moved celestial\nbodies, their motion would be violent. In spite of this objection,\nKilwardby leaves open the possibility for this view, diplomatically\nstating that because he does not know, he cannot assert it (quia\nnescio, asserere nolo) (D43Q 10, 19; 15, 21).\n(c)\nAccording to some, the cause of the motion of the celestial bodies\nis their own weight and inclination (instinctu propriorum\nponderum: D43Q 3, 192), in the same way as heavy and light bodies\nare moved by their own weight and inclination (propriis ponderibus\net inclinationibus: D43Q 2, 14).\n\n\n\nIn Kilwardby\u2019s own words:\n\nJust as heavy and light bodies are moved to a place in which they rest\nby their own inclinations and tendencies, so celestial bodies are\nmoved circularly in place by their own inclinations similar to the\nweight (quasi ponderibus) in order to conserve corruptible\nthings, lest they suddenly perish and fail. (trans. Weisheipl 1961,\n315).\n\n\nKilwardby\u2019s theory is, however, not absolutely original, as scholars\n(in particular Weisheipl) have shown. In fact, some sixty years\nearlier, John Blund argued for the same explanation in his\nTractaus de anima (paragraph 10); here he stated that heaven\n(including all celestial spheres) is moved by nature and not by the\nsoul or celestial beings. This view seemed to go unnoticed until\nKilwardby referred to it; originality claims apart, the significance\nof Kilwardby\u2019s statement must be emphasized. The interest of his\nsolution is in how it harmonizes a natural explanation for the\nphenomenon of celestial motion \u2013 designating the instinct of\ntheir [the celestial bodies\u2019] own weight as its cause \u2013 while at\nthe same time it safeguards God\u2019s influence in the natural world: God\nis not the direct mover, but the one who endows these bodies with\ntheir instinct (D43Q 2, 14; see Silva 2007 for references).\nTime\n\nOne of the questions Kilwardby addresses in his treatise On\ntime (De tempore)\u2014written most probably after\nDOS\u2014is whether time, as the measure of motion, is defined in\nrelation to the diurnal motion (DT 35), a view identified with\nAverroes. The aim of his treatise is to understand time in such a way\nthat it reveals compatibility between Aristotle\u2019s (Physics\nIV, 10\u201314) definition of time\u2014which Kilwardby calls\n\u2018physical\u2019\u2014as relative to motion (and motion\nrelative to continuous quantity) and the Augustinian\n(Confessions XI) definition of time\u2014which he calls\n\u2018metaphysical\u2019\u2014as an extension (distensio)\nof the mind, thus existing only in the mind (DT 10\u201311).\nKilwardby\u2019s solution is to argue for a distinction between\nindeterminate and determinate time: on the one hand, indeterminate\ntime exists outside of and independent from the numbering mind (it is\nneither numbered nor measured) as, prior to any measuring, that which\nis measured is already in motion (DT 77). Determinate time, on the\nother hand, has existence in the mind only, as it can only exist in\nthe measuring mind. In Kilwardby\u2019s own words, \u201ctime comes into\nexistence when we perceive the direction of that which is earlier and\nlater in motion\u201d (DT 77). Time is, therefore, the measure not of\nany specific motion but the measure of motion (DT 42) defined by an\ninstant before and an instant after. The quantity of motion between\nthese two instants, before and after, has a numerical expression (DT\n34), and this number is then used to measure all other motions (DT\n49): time \u201cmeasures the whole motion by determining the motion\nwhich will measure the whole\u201d (DT 27). Time is the number of\nmotion because number is the appropriate name for that\n measure.[31]\n We determine time by measuring motion according to fixed measures\n(days, hours, and so on) (DT 77). As the measure for any kind of\nmotion, time has unity.\n\nTime, hence, is dependent for its definition on motion (NSLP 7, 54).\nThe continuous nature of motion is essential to guarantee the\ncontinuous nature of time (DT 12). Time needs to be continuous for it\nto measure continuous motion (NSLP 8, 58). The continuity of motion,\nin turn, is guaranteed by the continuity of the parts that constitute\nthe moving thing (DT 17). Kilwardby argues that time and motion are\nexceptions to the rule according to which the parts of composite\nthings must exist simultaneously; instead, he claims, that they are\ncomposite transient things, and the parts of time are successive (DT\n7\u20139). Time has its being from the ordination of its parts into\nbefore and after (NSLP 8, 58). The instant (the now: nunc) is\nfrom the point of view of the substance which is always the same but\ndifferent in the manner of its existence (DT 89). Time is the measure\nof continuous motion, and the instant is the measure of one of the\nmoments of that continuous alteration (DT 94\u201395). For Kilwardby,\ncelestial motion as measured by time is the standard for measuring all\nother motions (see Trifogli 2013; for other aspects of Kilwardby\u2019s\ntreatment of time, namely the connections to his contemporaries, see\nPorro 1996.)",
