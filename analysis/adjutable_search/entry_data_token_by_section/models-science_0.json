    "main_text": "Semantics: Models and Representation\n1. Semantics: Models and Representation\n\nMany scientific models are representational models: they represent a\nselected part or aspect of the world, which is the model\u2019s\ntarget system. Standard examples are the billiard ball model of a gas,\nthe Bohr model of the atom, the Lotka\u2013Volterra model of predator\u2013prey\ninteraction, the Mundell\u2013Fleming model of an open economy, and the\nscale model of a bridge.\n\nThis raises the question what it means for a model to represent a\ntarget system. This problem is rather involved and decomposes into\nvarious subproblems. For an in-depth discussion of the issue of\nrepresentation, see the entry on\n scientific representation.\n At this point, rather than addressing the issue of what it means for\na model to represent, we focus on a number of different kinds of\nrepresentation that play important roles in the practice of\nmodel-based science, namely scale models, analogical models, idealized\nmodels, toy models, minimal models, phenomenological models,\nexploratory models, and models of data. These categories are not\nmutually exclusive, and a given model can fall into several categories\nat once.\n\nScale models. Some models are down-sized or enlarged copies\nof their target systems (Black 1962). A typical example is a small\nwooden car that is put into a wind tunnel to explore the actual\ncar\u2019s aerodynamic properties. The intuition is that a scale\nmodel is a naturalistic replica or a truthful mirror image of the\ntarget; for this reason, scale models are sometimes also referred to\nas \u201ctrue models\u201d (Achinstein 1968: Ch.\u00a07). However, there\nis no such thing as a perfectly faithful scale model; faithfulness is\nalways restricted to some respects. The wooden scale model of the car\nprovides a faithful portrayal of the car\u2019s shape but not of its\nmaterial. And even in the respects in which a model is a faithful\nrepresentation, the relation between model-properties and\ntarget-properties is usually not straightforward. When engineers use,\nsay, a 1:100 scale model of a ship to investigate the resistance that\nan actual ship experiences when moving through the water, they cannot\nsimply measure the resistance the model experiences and then multiply\nit with the scale. In fact, the resistance faced by the model does not\ntranslate into the resistance faced by the actual ship in a\nstraightforward manner (that is, one cannot simply scale the water\nresistance with the scale of the model: the real ship need not have\none hundred times the water resistance of its 1:100 model). The two\nquantities stand in a complicated nonlinear relation with each other,\nand the exact form of that relation is often highly nontrivial and\nemerges as the result of a thoroughgoing study of the situation\n(Sterrett 2006, forthcoming; Pincock forthcoming).\n\nAnalogical models. Standard examples of analogical models\ninclude the billiard ball model of a gas, the hydraulic model of an\neconomic system, and the dumb hole model of a black hole. At the most\nbasic level, two things are analogous if there are certain relevant\nsimilarities between them. In a classic text, Hesse (1963)\ndistinguishes different types of analogies according to the kinds of\nsimilarity relations into which two objects enter. A simple type of\nanalogy is one that is based on shared properties. There is an analogy\nbetween the earth and the moon based on the fact that both are large,\nsolid, opaque, spherical bodies that receive heat and light from the\nsun, revolve around their axes, and gravitate towards other bodies.\nBut sameness of properties is not a necessary condition. An analogy\nbetween two objects can also be based on relevant similarities between\ntheir properties. In this more liberal sense, we can say that there is\nan analogy between sound and light because echoes are similar to\nreflections, loudness to brightness, pitch to color, detectability by\nthe ear to detectability by the eye, and so on.\n\nAnalogies can also be based on the sameness or resemblance of\nrelations between parts of two systems rather than on their monadic\nproperties. It is in this sense that the relation of a father to his\nchildren is asserted to be analogous to the relation of the state to\nits citizens. The analogies mentioned so far have been what Hesse\ncalls \u201cmaterial analogies\u201d. We obtain a more formal notion\nof analogy when we abstract from the concrete features of the systems\nand only focus on their formal set-up. What the analogue model then\nshares with its target is not a set of features, but the same pattern\nof abstract relationships (i.e., the same structure, where structure\nis understood in a formal sense). This notion of analogy is closely\nrelated to what Hesse calls \u201cformal analogy\u201d. Two items\nare related by formal analogy if they are both interpretations of the\nsame formal calculus. For instance, there is a formal analogy between\na swinging pendulum and an oscillating electric circuit because they\nare both described by the same mathematical equation.\n\nA further important distinction due to Hesse is the one between\npositive, negative, and neutral analogies. The positive analogy\nbetween two items consists in the properties or relations they share\n(both gas molecules and billiard balls have mass); the negative\nanalogy consists in the properties they do not share (billiard balls\nare colored, gas molecules are not); the neutral analogy comprises the\nproperties of which it is not known (yet) whether they belong to the\npositive or the negative analogy (do billiard balls and molecules have\nthe same cross section in scattering processes?). Neutral analogies\nplay an important role in scientific research because they give rise\nto questions and suggest new hypotheses. For this reason several\nauthors have emphasized the heuristic role that analogies play in\ntheory and model construction, as well as in creative thought\n(Bailer-Jones and Bailer-Jones 2002; Bailer-Jones 2009: Ch.\u00a03; Hesse\n1974; Holyoak and Thagard 1995; Kroes 1989; Psillos 1995; and the\nessays collected in Helman 1988). See also the entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning.\n\nIt has also been discussed whether using analogical models can in some\ncases be confirmatory in a Bayesian sense. Hesse (1974: 208\u2013219)\nargues that this is possible if the analogy is a material analogy.\nBartha (2010, 2013 [2019]) disagrees and argues that analogical models\ncannot be confirmatory in a Bayesian sense because the information\nencapsulated in an analogical model is part of the relevant background\nknowledge, which has the consequence that the posterior probability of\na hypothesis about a target system cannot change as a result of\nobserving the analogy. Analogical models can therefore only establish\nthe plausibility of a conclusion in the sense of justifying a\nnon-negligible prior probability assignment (Bartha 2010:\n\u00a78.5).\n\nMore recently, these questions have been discussed in the context of\nso-called analogue experiments, which promise to provide knowledge\nabout an experimentally inaccessible target system (e.g., a black\nhole) by manipulating another system, the source system (e.g., a\nBose\u2013Einstein condensate). Dardashti, Th\u00e9bault, and Winsberg\n(2017) and Dardashti, Hartmann et al. (2019) have argued that, given\ncertain conditions, an analogue simulation of one system by another\nsystem can confirm claims about the target system (e.g., that black\nholes emit Hawking radiation). See Crowther et al. (forthcoming) for a\ncritical discussion, and also the entry on\n computer simulations in science.\n\nIdealized models. Idealized models are models that involve a\ndeliberate simplification or distortion of something complicated with\nthe objective of making it more tractable or understandable.\nFrictionless planes, point masses, completely isolated systems,\nomniscient and fully rational agents, and markets in perfect\nequilibrium are well-known examples. Idealizations are a crucial means\nfor science to cope with systems that are too difficult to study in\ntheir full complexity (Potochnik 2017).\n\nPhilosophical debates over idealization have focused on two general\nkinds of idealizations: so-called Aristotelian and Galilean\nidealizations. Aristotelian idealization amounts to \u201cstripping\naway\u201d, in our imagination, all properties from a concrete object\nthat we believe are not relevant to the problem at hand. There is\ndisagreement on how this is done. Jones (2005) and Godfrey-Smith\n(2009) offer an analysis of abstraction in terms of truth: while an\nabstraction remains silent about certain features or aspects of the\nsystem, it does not say anything false and still offers a true (albeit\nrestricted) description. This allows scientists to focus on a limited\nset of properties in isolation. An example is a classical-mechanics\nmodel of the planetary system, which describes the position of an\nobject as a function of time and disregards all other properties of\nplanets. Cartwright (1989: Ch.\u00a05), Musgrave (1981), who uses the term\n\u201cnegligibility assumptions\u201d, and M\u00e4ki (1994), who\nspeaks of the \u201cmethod of isolation\u201d, allow abstractions to\nsay something false, for instance by neglecting a causally relevant\nfactor.\n\nGalilean idealizations are ones that involve deliberate distortions:\nphysicists build models consisting of point masses moving on\nfrictionless planes; economists assume that agents are omniscient;\nbiologists study isolated populations; and so on. Using\nsimplifications of this sort whenever a situation is too difficult to\ntackle was characteristic of Galileo\u2019s approach to science. For\nthis reason it is common to refer to \u2018distortive\u2019\nidealizations of this kind as \u201cGalilean idealizations\u201d\n(McMullin 1985). An example for such an idealization is a model of\nmotion on an ice rink that assumes the ice to be frictionless, when,\nin reality, it has low but non-zero friction.\n\nGalilean idealizations are sometimes characterized as controlled\nidealizations, i.e., as ones that allow for de-idealization by\nsuccessive removal of the distorting assumptions (McMullin 1985;\nWeisberg 2007). Thus construed, Galilean idealizations don\u2019t\ncover all distortive idealizations. Batterman (2002, 2011) and Rice\n(2015, 2019) discuss distortive idealizations that are ineliminable in\nthat they cannot be removed from the model without dismantling the\nmodel altogether.\n\nWhat does a model involving distortions tell us about reality? Laymon\n(1991) formulated a theory which understands idealizations as ideal\nlimits: imagine a series of refinements of the actual situation which\napproach the postulated limit, and then require that the closer the\nproperties of a system come to the ideal limit, the closer its\nbehavior has to come to the behavior of the system at the limit\n(monotonicity). If this is the case, then scientists can study the\nsystem at the limit and carry over conclusions from that system to\nsystems distant from the limit. But these conditions need not always\nhold. In fact, it can happen that the limiting system does not\napproach the system at the limit. If this happens, we are faced with a\nsingular limit (Berry 2002). In such cases the system at the limit can\nexhibit behavior that is different from the behavior of systems\ndistant from the limit. Limits of this kind appear in a number of\ncontexts, most notably in the theory of phase transitions in\nstatistical mechanics. There is, however, no agreement over the\ncorrect interpretation of such limits. Batterman (2002, 2011) sees\nthem as indicative of emergent phenomena, while Butterfield (2011a,b)\nsees them as compatible with reduction (see also the entries on\n intertheory relations in physics\n and\n scientific reduction).\n\nGalilean and Aristotelian idealizations are not mutually exclusive,\nand many models exhibit both in that they take into account a narrow\nset of properties and distort them. Consider again the\nclassical-mechanics model of the planetary system: the model only\ntakes a narrow set of properties into account and distorts them, for\ninstance by describing planets as ideal spheres with a\nrotation-symmetric mass distribution.\n\nA concept that is closely related to idealization is approximation. In\na broad sense, A can be called an approximation of B if\nA is somehow close to B. This, however, is too broad\nbecause it makes room for any likeness to qualify as an approximation.\nRueger and Sharp (1998) limit approximations to quantitative\ncloseness, and Portides (2007) frames it as an essentially\nmathematical concept. On that notion A is an approximation of\nB iff A is close to B in a specifiable\nmathematical sense, where the relevant sense of \u201cclose\u201d\nwill be given by the context. An example is the approximation of one\ncurve with another one, which can be achieved by expanding a function\ninto a power series and only keeping the first two or three terms. In\ndifferent situations we approximate an equation with another one by\nletting a control parameter tend towards zero (Redhead 1980). This\nraises the question of how approximations are different from\nidealizations, which can also involve mathematical closeness. Norton\n(2012) sees the distinction between the two as referential: an\napproximation is an inexact description of the target while an\nidealization introduces a secondary system (real or fictitious) which\nstands for the target system (while being distinct from it). If we say\nthat the period of the pendulum on the wall is roughly two seconds,\nthen this is an approximation; if we reason about the real pendulum by\nassuming that the pendulum bob is a point mass and that the string is\nmassless (i.e., if we assume that the pendulum is a so-called ideal\npendulum), then we use an idealization. Separating idealizations and\napproximations in this way does not imply that there cannot be\ninteresting relations between the two. For instance, an approximation\ncan be justified by pointing out that it is the mathematical\nexpression of an acceptable idealization (e.g., when we neglect a\ndissipative term in an equation of motion because we make the\nidealizing assumption that the system is frictionless).\n\nToy models. Toy models are extremely simplified and strongly\ndistorted renderings of their targets, and often only represent a\nsmall number of causal or explanatory factors (Hartmann 1995;\nReutlinger et al. 2018; Nguyen forthcoming). Typical examples are the\nLotka\u2013Volterra model in population ecology (Weisberg 2013) and the\nSchelling model of segregation in the social sciences (Sugden\n2000). Toy models usually\ndo not perform well in terms of prediction and empirical adequacy, and\nthey seem to serve other epistemic goals (more on these in\n Section 3).\n This raises the question whether they should be regarded as\nrepresentational at all (Luczak 2017).\n\nSome toy models are characterized as \u201ccaricatures\u201d\n(Gibbard and Varian 1978; Batterman and Rice 2014). Caricature models\nisolate a small number of salient characteristics of a system and\ndistort them into an extreme case. A classic example is\nAkerlof\u2019s (1970) model of the car market (\u201cthe market for\nlemons\u201d), which explains the difference in price between new and\nused cars solely in terms of asymmetric information, thereby\ndisregarding all other factors that may influence the prices of cars\n(see also Sugden 2000).\nHowever, it is controversial whether such highly idealized models can\nstill be regarded as informative representations of their target\nsystems. For a discussion of caricature models, in particular in\neconomics, see Reiss (2006).\n\nMinimal models. Minimal models are closely related to toy\nmodels in that they are also highly simplified. They are so simplified\nthat some argue that they are non-representational: they lack any\nsimilarity, isomorphism, or resemblance relation to the world\n(Batterman and Rice 2014). It has been argued that many economic\nmodels are of this kind (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff 2009). Minimal economic models are\nalso unconstrained by natural laws, and do not isolate any real\nfactors (ibid.). And yet, minimal models help us to learn\nsomething about the world in the sense that they function as\nsurrogates for a real system: scientists can study the model to learn\nsomething about the target. It is, however, controversial whether\nminimal models can assist scientists in learning something about the\nworld if they do not represent anything (Fumagalli 2016). Minimal\nmodels that purportedly lack any similarity or representation are also\nused in different parts of physics to explain the macro-scale behavior\nof various systems whose micro-scale behavior is extremely diverse\n(Batterman and Rice 2014; Rice 2018, 2019; Shech 2018). Typical\nexamples are the features of phase transitions and the flow of fluids.\nProponents of minimal models argue that what provides an explanation\nof the macro-scale behavior of a system in these cases is not a\nfeature that system and model have in common, but the fact that the\nsystem and the model belong to the same universality class (a\nclass of models that exhibit the same limiting behavior even though\nthey show very different behavior at finite scales). It is, however,\ncontroversial whether explanations of this kind are possible without\nreference to at least some common features (Lange 2015; Reutlinger\n2017).\n\nPhenomenological models. Phenomenological models have been\ndefined in different, although related, ways. A common definition\ntakes them to be models that only represent observable properties of\ntheir targets and refrain from postulating hidden mechanisms and the\nlike (Bokulich 2011). Another approach, due to McMullin (1968),\ndefines phenomenological models as models that are independent of\ntheories. This, however, seems to be too strong. Many phenomenological\nmodels, while failing to be derivable from a theory, incorporate\nprinciples and laws associated with theories. The liquid-drop model of\nthe atomic nucleus, for instance, portrays the nucleus as a liquid\ndrop and describes it as having several properties (surface tension\nand charge, among others) originating in different theories\n(hydrodynamics and electrodynamics, respectively). Certain aspects of\nthese theories\u2014although usually not the full theories\u2014are\nthen used to determine both the static and dynamical properties of the\nnucleus. Finally, it is tempting to identify phenomenological models\nwith models of a phenomenon. Here, \u201cphenomenon\u201d\nis an umbrella term covering all relatively stable and general\nfeatures of the world that are interesting from a scientific point of\nview. The weakening of sound as a function of the distance to the\nsource, the decay of alpha particles, the chemical reactions that take\nplace when a piece of limestone dissolves in an acid, the growth of a\npopulation of rabbits, and the dependence of house prices on the base\nrate of the Federal Reserve are phenomena in this sense. For further\ndiscussion, see Bailer-Jones (2009: Ch.\u00a07), Bogen and Woodward (1988),\nand the entry on\n theory and observation in science.\n\nExploratory models. Exploratory models are models which are\nnot proposed in the first place to learn something about a specific\ntarget system or a particular experimentally established phenomenon.\nExploratory models function as the starting point of further\nexplorations in which the model is modified and refined. Gelfert\n(2016) points out that exploratory models can provide\nproofs-of-principle and suggest how-possibly explanations (2016: Ch.\u00a04). As an example, Gelfert mentions early models in theoretical\necology, such as the Lotka\u2013Volterra model of predator\u2013prey\ninteraction, which mimic the qualitative behavior of speed-up and\nslow-down in population growth in an environment with limited\nresources (2016: 80). Such models do not give an accurate account of\nthe behavior of any actual population, but they provide the starting\npoint for the development of more realistic models. Massimi (2019)\nnotes that exploratory models provide modal knowledge. Fisher (2006)\nsees these models as tools for the examination of the features of a\ngiven theory.\n\nModels of data. A model of data (sometimes also \u201cdata\nmodel\u201d) is a corrected, rectified, regimented, and in many\ninstances idealized version of the data we gain from immediate\nobservation, the so-called raw data (Suppes 1962). Characteristically,\none first eliminates errors (e.g., removes points from the record that\nare due to faulty observation) and then presents the data in a\n\u201cneat\u201d way, for instance by drawing a smooth curve through\na set of points. These two steps are commonly referred to as\n\u201cdata reduction\u201d and \u201ccurve fitting\u201d. When we\ninvestigate, for instance, the trajectory of a certain planet, we\nfirst eliminate points that are fallacious from the observation\nrecords and then fit a smooth curve to the remaining ones. Models of\ndata play a crucial role in confirming theories because it is the\nmodel of data, and not the often messy and complex raw data, that\ntheories are tested against.\n\nThe construction of a model of data can be extremely complicated. It\nrequires sophisticated statistical techniques and raises serious\nmethodological as well as philosophical questions. How do we decide\nwhich points on the record need to be removed? And given a clean set\nof data, what curve do we fit to it? The first question has been dealt\nwith mainly within the context of the philosophy of experiment (see,\nfor instance, Galison 1997 and Staley 2004). At the heart of the\nlatter question lies the so-called curve-fitting problem, which is\nthat the data themselves dictate neither the form of the fitted curve\nnor what statistical techniques scientists should use to construct a\ncurve. The choice and rationalization of statistical techniques is the\nsubject matter of the philosophy of statistics, and we refer the\nreader to the entry\n Philosophy of Statistics\n and to Bandyopadhyay and Forster (2011) for a discussion of these\nissues. Further discussions of models of data can be found in\nBailer-Jones (2009: Ch.\u00a07), Brewer and Chinn (1994), Harris (2003),\nHartmann (1995), Laymon (1982), Mayo (1996, 2018), and Suppes\n(2007).\n\nThe gathering, processing, dissemination, analysis, interpretation, and\nstorage of data raise many important questions beyond the relatively\nnarrow issues pertaining to models of data. Leonelli (2016, 2019)\ninvestigates the status of data in science, argues that data should\nbe defined not by their provenance but by their evidential function,\nand studies how data travel between different contexts.\n",
