This thesis follows from two observations about\neducation and children: first, that education significantly influences\na person\u2019s life chances in terms of labor market success,\npreparation for democratic citizenship, and general human flourishing;\nand second, that children\u2019s life chances should not be fixed by\ncertain morally arbitrary circumstances of their birth such as their\nsocial class, race, and gender.

These factors are: the central place of education in\nmodern societies and the myriad opportunities it affords; the scarcity\nof high-quality educational opportunities for many children; and the\ncritical role of the state in providing educational opportunities.\nThese factors differentiate education from many other social goods. We\nfollow this with a brief history of how equality of educational\nopportunity has been interpreted in the United States since the 1950s\nand the evolving legal understandings of equality of opportunity.

Equality of Educational Opportunity as an Independent Concern\n1.1 The Value of Education\n\nEducation has both instrumental and intrinsic value for individuals\nand for societies as a whole. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in its\nunanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954),\n\u201cIn these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\nexpected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an\neducation\u201d. The instrumental goals of K\u201312 education for\nindividuals include access to higher education and a constellation of\nprivate benefits that follow college education such as access to\ninteresting jobs with more vacation time and better health care;\ngreater personal and professional mobility, better decision-making\nskills (Institute for Higher Education Policy 1998) and more autonomy\nat work. Research further shows that education levels are correlated\nwith health and wealth: the more education a person has, the healthier\nand wealthier she is likely to be. At the same time, education is also\nconsidered intrinsically valuable. Developing one\u2019s skills and\ntalents can be enjoyable or good in itself and a central component of\na flourishing life, regardless of the consequences this has for wealth\nor health.\n\nIn addition to the instrumental and intrinsic value of education to an\nindividual, education is also valuable for society. All societies\nbenefit from productive and knowledgeable workers who can generate\nsocial surplus and respond to preferences. Furthermore, democratic\nsocieties need to create citizens who are capable of participating in\nthe project of shared governance. The correlation between educational\nattainment and civic participation is strong and well-documented:\neducated citizens have more opportunities to obtain and exercise civic\nskills, are more interested in and informed about politics, and in\nturn, are more likely to vote (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady 1995:\n432\u2013437, 445; Dee 2004).\n\nIt is therefore relatively uncontroversial to say that education is a\nhighly valuable good to both individuals and to society, especially to\ndemocratic societies. This makes questions about who has access to\nhigh-quality educational opportunities, and how educational\nopportunities should be distributed, particularly important.\n1.2 The Scarcity of High-Quality Educational Opportunity\n\nQuestions about the just distribution of educational opportunity are\nespecially vexing given the scarcity of resources allocated to\neducation. Although developed societies provide some education for\nfree to their citizens, funding for education is always in competition\nwith the need to provide citizens with other social goods. As Amy\nGutmann writes: \u201cThe price of using education to maximize the\nlife chances of children would be to forego these other social\ngoods\u201d (Gutmann 1999: 129). Other basic welfare needs (e.g.,\nhousing, healthcare, food), as well as cultural goods (e.g., museums,\nparks, concert halls), must be weighed against public funds allocated\nto education, thereby making high-quality education\u2014even in\nhighly productive societies\u2014scarce to some degree.\n\nThis scarcity is evident on several fronts with respect to higher\neducation in the United States, which attracts applicants from all\nover the world. There is fierce competition for admission to highly\nselective colleges and universities in the U.S. that admit fewer than\n10% of applicants. In this arena, wealthier parents sometimes go to\ngreat lengths to bolster their children\u2019s applications by paying\nfor tutoring, extracurricular activities, and admissions\ncoaching\u2014activities that can put applicants without these\nresources at a significant disadvantage in the admissions process. The\nrecent \u201cvarsity blues\u201d scandal, in which wealthy families\npaid millions of dollars to a college coach who promised admission to\nelite U.S. universities, is an extreme case in point about the degree\nof competition attached to selective universities.\n\nA more urgent demonstration of the scarcity of educational opportunity\nin the U.S. and many other societies is evident in how access to\nhigh-quality primary and secondary education is effectively limited to\nchildren whose families can afford housing in middle-class\nneighborhoods, or who have access to private schools via tuition or\nscholarships. Despite the Brown decision\u2019s eradication\nof de jure, or state-sanctioned, segregation by race in\nschools, public schools in the U.S. remain sharply segregated by race\nand by class due to de facto residential segregation. This\nsegregation has significant consequences for poor and minority\nstudents\u2019 educational opportunity. Given the strong correlation\nbetween school segregation, racial achievement gaps, and overall\nschool quality, poor and minority students are disproportionately\neducated in lower performing schools compared to their white and more\nadvantaged peers (Reardon 2015 and Reardon, Weathers, Fahle, Jang, and\nKalogrides 2022 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these systemic background\ninequalities, with prolonged school closures in the U.S.\ndisproportionately impacting low-income children who rely on schools\nto provide an array of social welfare services, including meals\n(Levinson, Cevik, and Lipsitch 2020; Levinson, Geller, and Allen,\n2021).\n\nIn view of the constellation of intrinsic and instrumental goods that\nflow from educational opportunity, and in the context of relative\nscarcity, questions about how educational resources should be\ndistributed are especially pressing as a matter of social and economic\njustice.\n1.3 The State Regulation of Education\n\nA third consideration that underscores the importance of thinking\nabout the distribution of educational opportunities is that in most\ndeveloped societies, the vast majority of such opportunities are\nprovided through and regulated by the state. All developed societies\nhave a legal requirement that children attend school for a certain\nnumber of years. This means that, unlike other policy levers,\neducation is typically under the control of state institutions and has\nthe potential to reach the vast majority of the nation\u2019s\nchildren across racial, religious, class, and gender-based divides.\nAnd given the myriad benefits that flow from education, it is arguably\na state\u2019s most powerful mechanism for influencing the lives of\nits members. This makes education perhaps the most important function\nof government.\n\nSince education is an integral function of government, and because it\nis an opportunity that government largely provides, there are special\nconstraints on its distribution. Justice, if it requires nothing else,\nrequires that governments treat their citizens with equal concern and\nrespect. The state, for example, cannot justly provide unequal\nbenefits to children on the basis of factors such as their race or\ngender. Indeed, such discrimination, even when it arises from indirect\nstate measures such as the funding of schools from property taxes, can\nbe especially pernicious to and is not lost on children. When poor and\nminority children see, for example, that their more advantaged peers\nattend better resourced public schools\u2014a conclusion that can be\ndrawn in many cases simply by comparing how school facilities\nlook\u2014they may internalize the view that the state cares less\nabout cultivating their interests and skills. Children in this\nposition suffer the dignitary injury of feeling that they are not\nequal to their peers in the state\u2019s eyes (Kozol 1991, 2005).\nThis harm is especially damaging to one\u2019s self-respect because\nit is the development of one\u2019s talents that is at stake; whether\nor not one has opportunities to gain the skills and confidence to\npursue their conception of the good is central to what Rawls calls\n\u201cthe social basis of self-respect\u201d (Rawls 1999: sections\n65 and 67; Satz 2007: 639).\n2. A Brief History of Equality of Educational Opportunity in the United States\n\nGiven the importance of education to individuals and to society, it is\nclear that education cannot be distributed by the market: it needs to\nbe available to all children, even children whose parents would be too\npoor or too indifferent to pay for it. Furthermore, if education is to\nplay a role in equipping young people to participate in the labor\nmarket, to participate in democratic governance, and more generally to\nlead flourishing lives, then its content cannot be arbitrary but\nrather must be tailored to meet these desired outcomes. We address\nconsiderations of education\u2019s content in subsequent sections,\nturning first to how equality of opportunity has been interpreted in\nthe U.S., where we can see some of the implications of a truncated\nunderstanding of equality of opportunity in stark form.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of\nEducation (1954) decision, in finding racially segregated public\nschools unconstitutional, declared that the opportunity for an\neducation, when provided for by the state, is a \u201cright which\nmust be available to all on equal terms\u201d. But de facto\nracial segregation persists in the U.S. and is coupled today with\never-growing class-based segregation (Reardon & Bischoff 2011).\nBlack students are far more likely to attend high-poverty schools than\ntheir white peers (see school poverty, in the National Equity Atlas,\n Other Internet Resources).\n The resulting, compounded educational disadvantages that poor,\nminority children face in the U.S. are significant. As research\ncontinues to document, the racial/ethnic achievement gap is persistent\nand large in the U.S. and has lasting labor market effects, whereby\nthe achievement gap has been found to explain a significant part of\nracial/ethnic income disparities (Reardon, Robinson-Cimpian, &\nWeathers 2015; Reardon 2021 in Other Internet Resources).\n\nEfforts to combat de facto segregation have been limited by\nU.S. jurisprudence since the Brown decision. Although the\nSupreme Court previously allowed plans to integrate schools within a\nparticular school district (see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBoard of Education, 1970), in Milliken v. Bradley (1974)\nthe Court struck down an inter-district busing plan that moved\nstudents across district lines to desegregate the Detroit city and\nsurrounding suburban schools. This limitation on legal remedies for\nde facto segregation has significantly hampered integration\nefforts given that most school districts in the U.S. are not racially\ndiverse. More recently, the U.S. Supreme Court further curtailed\nintegration efforts within the small number of districts that are\nracially diverse. In its Parents Involved in Community Schools v.\nSeattle School District decision (2006), the Court prohibited\ndistricts from explicitly using individual students\u2019 race as a\nfactor in school assignment plans, thereby condoning only race-neutral\nintegration plans in what many regarded as the Court\u2019s final\nretreat from redressing de facto segregation (e.g., Rebell\n2009; Ryan 2007).\n\nThe persistence of race and class-based segregation in the U.S. and\nthe educational disadvantages that follow are rooted in the U.S.\nsystem of geographically defined school districts, whereby schools are\nlargely funded by local property taxes that differ substantially\nbetween communities based on property values. This patchwork system\ncompounds the educational disadvantages that follow from residential\nsegregation. The 50 states in the United States differ dramatically in\nthe level of per pupil educational funding that they provide; indeed\nsome of these interstate disparities are greater than the intra-state\ninequalities that have received greater attention (Liu 2006). The\nsystem for funding schools and the residential segregation it\nexacerbates\u2014itself the product of decades of laws and conscious\npolicies to keep the races separate\u2014has produced and continues\nto yield funding inequalities that disproportionately affect poor\nAmericans of color. The segregation of resources, with greater\nresources flowing to children from families in the upper quintiles of\nsociety, makes it highly unlikely that children from the lower\nquintiles can have an equal chance of achieving success. This is\nevident in research documenting the growing achievement gap between\nhigh and low-income students, which is now 30\u201340% greater among\nchildren born in 2001 than those born twenty-five years before\n(Reardon 2011: 91; Reardon 2021 in Other Internet Resources).\n\nGiven the judicial retreat from remedying de facto\nsegregation, many advocates have shifted their attention to the school\nfinance system. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in this arena\nwas an initial setback to efforts to advance educational equality via\nfederal school finance litigation. In this case, San Antonio\nIndependent School District v. Rodriguez (1973), the Court found\nthat there is no federal right to education, and that funding\ninequalities among school districts due to variations in property tax\nrevenue are not unconstitutional. This decision further entrenched the\neducational inequalities that follow from the geographic happenstance\nof a child\u2019s home. In contrast to the U.S., many other countries\ndo not finance their schools through local property taxes (e.g.,\nFinland funds its schools at the national level based on the number of\nstudents they educate, and it provides more funding to schools that\neducate more students who are immigrants or whose parents are\nunemployed or uneducated; Sahlberg 2011). Many other societies\ndistribute educational resources in a more centralized way than does\nthe United States, which leaves educational funding, and even\neducational standards, to a large extent in local hands (for a recent\nvolume on the idea of a federal right to education in the U.S., see\nRobinson 2019).\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court did, however, leave an opening for state courts\nto act, and so legal advocates have adopted a state-by-state approach\nin the decades since Rodriguez. As this litigation has\nunfolded in almost every U.S. state, a policy debate with\nphilosophical underpinnings has emerged around the question: Should\neducational resources be distributed on an equal basis (an equity\nmodel), or according to a sufficiency threshold (adequacy model)?\nState constitutions differ as to the basis they suggest for the\nstate\u2019s interest in funding education.\n\nIn the legal and political sphere, the adequacy approach has been more\nsuccessful in school finance litigation at the state level. But the\nphilosophical elaboration of equity and adequacy as competing ideals\nis somewhat distinct from how they are used in legal battles and\npolitical discourse. As we describe below, some theorists challenge\nthe cogency of the sharp distinction often made between these two ways\nof justifying the distribution of educational resources.\n3. The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nDebates about the meaning and value of equality of educational\nopportunity\u2014and about whether equal educational opportunity\nrequires equality or adequacy\u2014can be considered in the light of\ntwo questions.\n\nThe first question is that given the diverse goals of\neducation\u2014preparing individuals for the job market, for\ndemocratic citizenship, and to experience the intrinsic goods of\neducation\u2014is there only one justified rubric for distributing\neducational resources? For instance, distributional policies that\nsupport career preparation may be very different from those that\nsupport other goals like preparation for democratic citizenship. Since\nthe labor market is a highly competitive sphere, education for labor\nmarket success appears to be a positional good, understood as a good\nwhose value depends on one\u2019s relative standing (i.e., the\nquality of my education for labor market success depends to a great\nextent on how good your education in this realm is since we will be\nvying for jobs). In a highly competitive job market with high stakes,\ndistributing educational resources equally becomes especially\nimportant.\n\nConversely, education for human flourishing can be seen as a\nnon-positional good because an individual\u2019s attainment of the\nintrinsic goods of education (e.g., to enjoy literature, to be\nintellectually curious) is not compromised by others\u2019 success in\nthis realm; it is not a competitive field. In fact, one\u2019s\nability to enjoy the arts might be increased by others\u2019 ability\nto do so too. An adequacy threshold for distributing educational\nopportunities directed at human flourishing may therefore be\njustified. As our educational goals vary, so too might the\ndistributive principles for educational resources need to change.\n\nThe second question we must consider is about the best interpretation\nof the ideal of equality of educational opportunity. Is equality of\nopportunity achieved when everyone with similar talent gets the same\nresults? When per pupil expenditures are equalized? When those with\nthe same natural talent potential get the same opportunities?\n\nAnswers to these two fundamental questions enable philosophers to\nconstruct a conception of equality of educational opportunity. Of\ncourse, philosophical controversies remain even supposing the content\nof the conception can be settled. Some of these controversies concern\nclashes with other values, including that of the family and diversity:\nWhat limits do parental rights put on the pursuit of equality of\neducational opportunity? Is affirmative action required by or contrary\nto equality of educational opportunity? Other issues arise when we try\nto interpret what equality of educational opportunity means for those\nwith disabilities, or when we attempt to define \u201cmerit\u201d\nand \u201cnative talent potential\u201d.\n\nThe following sections of this entry will describe the key maneuvers\nin different ways of answering these two questions: first, what the\nideal can mean and what distributive principles realize it; and\nsecond, how to navigate tensions between this ideal and other values.\nThe first section below introduces debates about the various\ndefinitions of equality of educational opportunity and its associated\ndistributive principles. Some of the material covered in this section\ncomes from the literature on equality of opportunity more generally,\nwhich we apply to educational aspects of these debates (for a recent\narticle in this spirit written for the education policy and research\ncommunity, see Levinson, Geron, and Brighouse, 2022). The subsequent\nsection surveys debates about how to negotiate the challenges faced by\nthose looking to realize the ideal of equality of educational\nopportunity, including whether equality of educational opportunity can\nbe reconciled with respecting the private sphere of the family.\n3.1 What is Educational Opportunity?\n\nBefore we can say what an equal educational opportunity is, we need to\nsay what an opportunity is in general. Peter Westen (1985) provides a\nhelpful definition of an opportunity that can be applied to the\neducation sphere. For Westen, an opportunity is a relationship between\nan agent or a set of agents, and a desired goal, mediated by certain\nobstacles, none of which are insurmountable. For instance, Alice has\nan opportunity to become educated mediated by obstacles such as\nenrolling at a school, putting in hard work, and the quality of her\nteachers.\n\nTo employ this concept in the context of education, we need to answer\nquestions about who the proper agents are, what the appropriate goal\nor goals are, and what, if any, obstacles are legitimate. For example,\nif we take admission at a highly selective college as our goal, and\nthe citizens of some country as our agents, we might think that\nmeeting a certain academic requirement, such as passing an entrance\nexam, is a relevant obstacle that should be permitted to stand in the\nway of the goal. In this context, we will also think that an\napplicant\u2019s race, sex or religious affiliation should not be\nobstacles. When the appropriate group faces only the relevant\nobstacles with respect to the appropriate goal we can say that\nequality of opportunity obtains between the members of that group.\n\nFor instance, Alice and Belle have equal opportunity to attend a\nselective university if, all other things being equal, the only\nobstacle they face is passing an entry test, which is a relevant\nobstacle. They do not have equal opportunity if Alice also faces an\nirrelevant obstacle, such as race-based discrimination, that Belle\ndoes not face.\n\nEducational opportunities are those opportunities that aim to enable\nindividuals to acquire knowledge and certain skills, and to cultivate\ncertain capacities. As noted above, we may value educational\nopportunity in some instances for the intrinsic value of acquiring\nknowledge, while in other cases we may care more about its\ninstrumental effects on individual welfare (e.g., labor market\nsuccess). Whatever our rationale for caring about educational\nopportunity, in order for an individual to be said to have this\nopportunity, she must have no insurmountable, irrelevant obstacles to\nthe particular educational goal we have in mind.\n\nMost commonly we associate the goals that constitute educational\nopportunities with access to educational institutions such as schools\nand universities, but apprenticeships and professional development and\ntraining also provide educational opportunities. In addition, there\nare many informal types of educational opportunity. These include\npublic debates and lectures as well as time spent reading, practicing,\nor thinking outside of a school context.\n\nMost contributors to debates about equality of educational opportunity\nfocus on opportunities that are made available through public\nK\u201312 and higher education institutions. The reasons for this are\nsimilar to our reasons for being concerned with educational\nopportunity in the first place. Those institutional opportunities are\nmore easily regulated and under the state\u2019s control, they\neducate the vast majority of children in the developed world, and they\nhave a profound effect on the quality of our lives. As a result, most\nof the literature primarily concerns K\u201312 educational\ninstitutions and colleges. Nevertheless, a crucial question concerns\nthe extent to which the state should try to address inequalities in\neducational opportunities that are generated through the family. For\nexample, we know that parents who read to their children give their\nchildren an educational advantage (Hutton et al. 2015). Should the\nstate seek to correct for the disadvantages of those children whose\nparents could not (or would not) read to them? More generally, parents\npass on not only genetic traits to their children, but also\ncharacteristics that differentially prepare children for success at\nschool, and even at jobs. Again, how should the state respond to these\nand other factors that influence children\u2019s likelihood of\nsuccess at school? Are these appropriate obstacles for children to\nface or not?\n\nThe next sections survey different interpretations of equal\neducational opportunity in view of these questions.\n3.2 Formal Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nFormal equality of opportunity is the view that formal rules that make\nreference to personal or ascriptive characteristics should not be\nobstacles to achieving certain goals. Such characteristics include\nrace, socio-economic class, gender, religion, and sexuality. It is\nessentially a concept of equality before the law. It is often\nunderstood as an anti-discrimination principle (See the entry on\n equality of opportunity\n for more discussion).\n\nAs applied to educational opportunity, formal equality of opportunity\nrequires the removal of formal obstacles, in the form of laws or\nentrance criteria for educational institutions, which refer to\nascriptive characteristics. For instance, formal equality of\nopportunity is opposed to legally segregated schools whose admissions\npolicy states that students be white, male or belong to a certain\nreligion. This conception is likewise opposed to laws that endorse or\nrequire segregation in schools. The Brown decision is\ncertainly consistent with at least formal equality of opportunity. At\nthe same time, it is worth noting that formal equality of opportunity\nis at odds with the tolerant attitude many societies take toward\nschools and colleges that are segregated by sex and religion. One\npossible way in which these practices might be reconciled with formal\nequality of educational opportunity would be to argue that this\nprinciple applies only to public educational institutions and not\nprivate schools and colleges. Some people accept that formal equality\nof opportunity is a sufficient norm to guide the distribution of\neducational opportunities, but most political and moral philosophers\naccept it as necessary but not sufficient. A principle of\nnon-discrimination leaves open whether and to what extent the state\nneeds to provide the resources that are required for education, or how\nthose resources should be distributed (see Gutmann 1999: 127ff). Since\nresources are necessary for education\u2014whether in the form of\nbooks and materials, teachers, facilities, and so on\u2014formal\nequality of opportunity is compatible with some children failing to\nactually receive an education. Formal equality of opportunity fails to\nprovide effective equality of opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, formal equality of educational opportunity is not\nconcerned with the informal rules, social norms, or private\ndiscrimination that people in a society face that can have a profound\neffect on a child\u2019s opportunities for education. Consider that\nformal equality of opportunity is compatible with school segregation,\nif school attendance zones were determined by residence and residence\nwere segregated by race and social class (as is typically the case in\nthe U.S.). If integration is a moral imperative, formal equality of\nopportunity cannot achieve this goal (Anderson 2010). Many people\nbelieve that insofar as informal discrimination is an unfair obstacle\nto educational opportunity, it is a serious problem that requires\npolicy attention.\n\nEven if formal equality of opportunity could be defended as a just\ndistributional principle outside of the educational context, perhaps\nbecause going beyond it violates certain rights (see Nozick 1997), it\ncannot be defended in the context of schooling. No democratic society\ncan justify failing to educate the children of its poorest students.\n(Additionally, see Friedman & Friedman, 1990, for a libertarian\nargument for universal education based on its third party\neffects.)\n3.3 Meritocratic Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nProponents of meritocratic equality of opportunity argue that no other\nobstacle besides merit should stand in the way of achievement of the\ndesired goals. This view requires that educational goods be\ndistributed solely in accordance with individual merit. In the context\nof education, merit is often measured by entrance requirements,\naptitude tests, or grades on exams. Of course, merit could be defined\nin some other way\u2014by how hard a student works, by how much a\nstudent improves, or by classroom participation, although all of these\nindicators pose measurement challenges.\n\nMeritocratic equality of opportunity has well-known limitations,\nespecially with respect to children. If educational opportunities\nshould be given to those who have the most merit in terms of the best\nscores on entrance tests, we will overlook the fact that merit is\nendogenous to education, which is to say, educational opportunity\nitself creates merit (Satz 2007). The more educational opportunities\nan individual child has, the more \u201cmerit\u201d that child may\ncome to have. This might suggest that we should pay more attention to\nindividuals\u2019 underlying potential rather than to their assessed\nmerit. Yet few people believe that we should give opportunities to\nthose who have the most underlying but uncultivated ability at the\nexpense of those who have less underlying ability or who are less\nqualified but have worked hard (Miller 1996).\n\nTo illustrate a second limitation with the meritocratic conception of\nequal educational opportunity, imagine that all highly selective\nuniversity places have been awarded to members of the upper class\nthrough cronyism, and that a progressive new government is suddenly\nelected into power to enforce meritocratic admissions. After\ngenerations of consolidating superior education, jobs and wealth at\nthe expense of the poor, the upper-classes are in a far better place,\nparticularly if private schooling is available, to ensure that their\nchildren end up being the most meritorious, thereby preserving vast\nsocial inequalities between members of different classes. Although\nsome opportunities are open to all equally, opportunities to develop\n\u201cmerit\u201d are not distributed equally (Williams 1962).\nIntergenerational transmission of opportunities to cultivate merit\nwould generate a deeply divided and unequal society, which is at odds\nwith the ideal of equality of educational opportunity.\n\nTwo further limitations concerning meritocratic equality of\nopportunity in the context of education are worth noting, aside from\nthe possible toxic consequences of engaging in meritocratic rhetoric\n(Young 1958; Sandel 2020). The first, as has already been mentioned,\nis that the definition of merit itself can be contentious. Is there an\naccount of merit that is wholly independent of conceptions of justice\n(Sen 2000)? Is merit simply what maximizes productivity? Should merit\nbe based solely on test scores or also take into account moral\nattributes like the ability to work cooperatively with others?\n\nThe second is that while conditioning educational opportunities on\n\u201cmerit\u201d may look compelling when dealing with young\nadults, it is deeply problematic when applied to very young children.\nAs Michael Walzer (1983: 203) notes, the job of the reading teacher is\nto teach children to read, not merely to offer the opportunity to\nlearn to read. And this job presumably includes all children in a\nclassroom\u2014even those who are not especially\n\u201cmeritorious\u201d. Perhaps this is also why the educational\n\u201ctracking\u201d of very young children on the basis of ability\nseems especially objectionable\u2014there are certain capacities that\nneed to be cultivated in all children (Satz 2007).\n3.4 Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nBecause of the limits of formal equality of opportunity, John Rawls\ndeveloped a conception he calls Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO).\nFEO requires that social offices and positions be formally open to\nall, and that individuals who are similarly talented and motivated\nshould have a roughly equal chance to attain these positions,\nindependent of their social class background (Rawls 2001:\n42\u201344). FEO holds that all citizens of a society count as the\nrelevant agents, the desired goal is offices and positions, and the\nobstacles people should not face includes their social class\nbackground. The obstacles people may legitimately face include having\nfewer developed abilities or less willingness to use them.\n\nWhen applied to education, this principle may support educational\nmeasures that close the achievement gap between the rich and the poor\nwith the same high talent potentials, assuming that these children can\nbe identified. This is because such students from poorer backgrounds\nshould fare as well as their wealthier peers with the same potentials.\nThe Rawlsian principle of FEO aims to eliminate the effects of social\nbackground and economic class on educational achievement. Fair\nequality of opportunity therefore offers a radical interpretation of\nequality of educational opportunity.\n3.5 Debates about Fair Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nDebates about FEO have focused on the relative importance of the goods\nit regulates (i.e., access to offices and positions) and the fact that\nit regards inequalities in inborn potential as relevant obstacles\ngenerally, and in the education arena.\n\nIn A Theory of Justice, Rawls accords the fair equality of\nopportunity principle priority over access to other types of\nadvantages such as income and wealth. Disputing this priority, some\nhave argued that the opportunities that FEO regulates are not more\nimportant than these other goods and that we should prefer a principle\n(known, for example, in Rawls\u2019 work as the difference principle)\nthat ensures that the least advantaged are as well-off as possible in\nterms of income (or according to some critics, well-being) (Alexander\n1985; Arneson 1999; Clayton 2001; Miklosi 2010). Richard Arneson\npresses this complaint forcefully in his paper \u201cAgainst Rawlsian\nEquality of Opportunity\u201d. Rawls\u2019 argument for FEO over the\ndifference principle comes from a commitment to individuals\u2019\nself-respect and the contribution that the ability to compete for\noffices and social positions on fair terms make to that self-respect.\nBut Arneson argues that those among us with lesser capacities might\nreasonably reject according such weight to the self-respect of the\ntalented. After all, the self-respect derived from the results of a\n\u201cnatural lottery\u201d is unequally distributed. The untalented\namong us, Arneson argues, would prefer increases in well-being to a\nprinciple of self-respect that confers no benefit to them.\n\nIn terms of education, rather than ensuring that those with the same\ninborn talent potential and ambition have the same level of\neducational achievement, Arneson would emphasize that educational\nopportunities should aim at promoting the welfare of the least\nadvantaged. This is more important, as he sees it, than ensuring that\nfuture competitions for jobs are fairly structured. But Rawls and his\ndefenders have argued that wealth and welfare are different in kind\nfrom the goods that FEO regulates, and that FEO pertains to more\nimportant goods that are closely connected to autonomy, the social\nbases of self-respect, and what he calls the two moral powers. This\nexplains their priority and irreducibility (Taylor 2004; Shields 2015;\nShiffrin 2004). Further, if everyone had a decent minimum, then the\nadditional contribution of wealth to well-being is less significant.\nIn subsequent work however, Rawls does acknowledge that the priority\nof FEO over his difference principle may be less stringent than he\nthought.\n\nSome philosophers criticize FEO as insufficiently egalitarian. This\ncriticism has taken two forms. First, some claim that by making fair\nopportunities relative to motivation, FEO has insufficient bite in a\nnon-ideal world in which inequality frequently produces diminished\naspirations in the oppressed. If women have been socialized for\ncenturies to think that certain positions in society are beyond their\ncapacities, and accordingly they are not motivated to pursue such\npositions, does FEO have the resources to criticize this?\n\nA second objection points out that inequalities in social luck (e.g.,\nbeing born into a poor family, which FEO requires institutions to\ncorrect for) and inequalities in natural luck (e.g., being born with\nless talent potential, which FEO does not require institutions to\ncorrect for) should be treated the same. It is easy to think that both\ntypes of luck are equally arbitrary from a moral point of view, and\nthat this arbitrariness is a source of injustice. Indeed, some of\nRawls\u2019 own remarks seem to suggest this. Why, we might ask,\nshould educational institutions help close the gap between the\ntalented rich and talented poor but do nothing to close the gap\nbetween talented and untalented students, when being untalented is,\njust like social class, totally unavoidable. Matthew Clayton and\nRichard Arneson press this complaint against Rawls. Clayton claims\nthat Rawls\u2019 own reasoning appears to privilege consistency about\nboth types of luck. So Rawls should either accept a different\nprinciple applying to both natural and social luck, or else he must\ncondone a type of natural aristocracy for both talent and wealth.\n\nPart of a response to these objections would have to defend the\nresources that Rawlsian theory has for dealing with race and gender as\nobstacles to fair equality of opportunity as well as the importance of\nthe specific goods that FEO protects. Rawls himself singled out\ncertain goods as having a higher priority than the goods of income and\nwealth alone. In defense of Rawls on the first objection, Seana\nShiffrin (2004) has argued that FEO is a \u201crobust\nanti-discrimination principle\u201d, which should not be read out of\nits context within Rawls\u2019 two principles as a whole. Moreover,\nit\n\n\nwould be difficult to provide the sort of educational training\nnecessary to fulfill the principle\u2019s commands without thereby\nengaging in teaching that also combatted the stereotypes that produce\nsignificant differentiation of ambitions. (2004: 1650, fn31)\n\n\nOn her view, the social bases of self-respect require the robust\nanti-discrimination principle that FEO provides. In defense of Rawls\non the second objection, Robert Taylor (2004) has attempted to show\nthat self-realization has a crucial place in the hierarchy of goods on\nthe Kantian interpretation of Rawls\u2019 principles. He claims that\nFEO therefore has priority over the difference principle because it\nregulates goods that are more central to the exercise of our moral\npowers and our highest order interests. However, his defense of Rawls\nhas been criticized for being overly perfectionist and therefore not\npolitically liberal. If this criticism is sound, then it may seem to\nimply that while perfectionist Rawlsians can justify FEO, political\nliberal Rawlsians cannot. Liam Shields (2015) argues that there is a\nnon-perfectionist account of self-realization and that this leads us\nto supplement the principle of FEO with a principle of sufficient\nself-realization. This may be one way to defend FEO against those who\nfavor a strict focus on welfare.\n\nHowever, these responses would not satisfy those who believe that we\nshould adopt prioritarianism with respect to especially important\ngoods, distributing them in a way that gives priority to those who\nhave the least (Schouten 2012). Prioritarianism is a controversial\nview, and has some controversial implications for the distribution of\nK\u201312 education. For example, a prioritarian view might endorse\nproviding no state supported educational resources at all for those\nwho are extremely talented, unless it could be shown that doing so\nimproves the lot of the least well off. But many people will reject\nthis implication, believing that the state does have educational\nobligations to the talented in their own right. Prioritarianism is\nalso inattentive to inequalities that obtain elsewhere in the\ndistributional scheme, for example, between those at the median and\nthose at the very top. Many egalitarians will be disturbed by\ndisproportionate opportunities going to the top 1%, even if the very\nbottom of the distribution is improved. Rawls\u2019 view is not a\nsimple prioritarian one, but instead endorses a complex set of\nprinciples\u2014some of which are egalitarian such as FEO, and some\nof which give special attention to the least well off, such as the\ndifference principle.\n\nA final issue with FEO concerns our understanding of, and ability to\ndetermine, natural levels of talent. It can be very hard to know who\nhas the most potential even when children are well into their\nschooling. This suggests that it is not an appropriate or feasible\nbenchmark for the regulation of social institutions since we could\nnever know whether it was satisfied (Gomberg 1975). In addition, the\nfocus on natural talents has led some to consider the interaction\nbetween epigenetic traits and social environmental factors, calling\ninto question the integrity of this distinction. This expands our\nsense of the arbitrariness of natural inequalities and may provide\nimportant insights on how to redress these inequalities (Loi, Del\nSavio and Stupka 2013).\n3.6 Equality of Educational Opportunity for Flourishing\n\nOne goal of education is to enable young people to grow into adults\nwho have flourishing lives. What would it mean to give children the\nequal opportunity for flourishing lives? Again, that depends on the\nview one should have about the appropriate obstacles. At the most\nextreme, some have argued all people should face only the obstacle of\ntheir own choices. The view makes sense of many of our intuitions. For\nexample, we tend to think that victims of bad luck, those born with\ndisabilities, or those who are severely harmed by natural disasters,\nare entitled to aid. Meanwhile, those who gamble and lose are not\nusually viewed as having any case for compensation.\n\nThe view so stated has very radical implications for educational\ninstitutions since it charges them with ensuring that all\nstudents have equal prospects for living well, regardless of\ndifferences in their natural potentials. Thus, educational\ninstitutions organized in accordance with equality of opportunity for\nflourishing would not only have to provide compensatory support and\nresources for those from disadvantaged family backgrounds, but also\nfor those who have genetic disadvantages.\n\nMany philosophers have taken issue with this general view. Some have\nargued that its unmitigated emphasis on choice and responsibility\nwould lead to stigma (e.g., Anderson 1999; Wolff 1998). Imagine a\nletter to parents saying that the state is offering your child extra\nopportunities because your genes create significant disadvantages.\nMoreover, as has already been noted, any view emphasizing choice so\nheavily seems especially out of place when dealing with young\nchildren.\n\nWe also need an account of the flourishing that should be the aim of\neducational opportunities. Is it to be understood in terms of\npreference satisfaction? Or something else? Would it require autonomy?\nIn choosing an account of flourishing, we have to respond to these\nquestions and also be attentive to concerns about sectarianism. How\ncan an undoubtedly controversial account of what makes a human life\nvaluable (e.g., that a good life is an autonomous life) be a suitable\nbasis for educational policy in a pluralistic society? Many liberals\nargue that families may justifiably reject, and request exemption\nfrom, an education that conflicts with their religious, cultural, or\npolitical views. They argue that an educational system driven by a\nprinciple of equality of opportunity for flourishing will not respect\nindividuals\u2019 entitlement to pursue their own account of how they\nwish to live, in accordance with their own reason (Rawls 2005). Of\ncourse, it might be pointed out in reply, that educational decisions\nmade by parents affect not only their own views of how to live but\nalso, and more importantly, their children\u2019s.\n3.7 Equality of Educational Opportunity for the Labor Market\n\nA second key goal for education, which plays a prominent role in\npublic discourse, is to prepare individuals for productive employment.\nEducation for the labor market has significant benefits for the state\n(e.g., GDP growth) and for individuals (e.g., remunerative and\nrewarding employment and all its associated benefits, including more\ndiscretionary income, more leisure time, and in the U.S., better\nhealthcare). This function of education is critically important as a\nmatter of justice. Education aimed at preparing individuals for\nemployment has become especially pressing in view of the income\ninequalities that leading economists have highlighted (Piketty 2014;\nSaez & Zucman 2014). And since education for employment is a\nhighly positional good given a competitive labor market, it matters\nall the more how educational opportunity in this arena is\ndistributed.\n\nAlthough there is a clear correlation between educational attainment,\nincome, and employment rates (see 2022 U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics,\n Other Internet Resources),\n the link between academic achievement as measured on tests and labor\nmarket outcomes has been found to be more attenuated (Bowles, Gintis,\n& Osborne 2001). Research has shown that \u201csoft skills\u201d\n(e.g., personality traits like tenacity; individual\u2019s goals and\npreferences) may be more predictive of success than cognitive\nabilities measured by test scores (Heckman & Kautz 2012).\nMoreover, schooling that is most directly targeted at\nemployment\u2014vocational education\u2014has a history in the U.S.\nof entrenching race and class-based inequalities (e.g., Oakes 1985).\nAlthough the relationship between traditional academic skills and\nlabor market success may be less significant than previously thought,\nand despite the checkered history of vocational education, formal\nschooling still has a critical role to play toward equipping\nindividuals for labor market success on several fronts.\n\nFirst, students do acquire soft skills in formal school settings. One\nstudy found that student achievement on tests accounts for just 20% of\nthe effects of educational attainment on earnings (Bowles, Gintis,\n& Osborne 2001), which indicates that schools are cultivating\nnon-cognitive skills that tests do not measure, and that are\nconsequential in the labor market (Levin 2012). Second, educational\nattainment has long been seen to have a signaling function in the\nlabor market (Spence 1973), whereby employers rely upon job\ncandidates\u2019 educational credentials as a proxy for future\nproductivity. Educational attainment itself, then, apart from\napplicants\u2019 demonstration of particular skills, is central to\nscreening and differentiating candidates. Finally, a college diploma\nhas become especially consequential in recent years as the income gap\nbetween those with and without one has grown; individuals with a\nbachelors degree earn 84% more over their lifetime than those with\njust a high school diploma (see Carnevale, Rose & Cheah 2011).\nLesley Jacobs\u2019 notion of stakes fairness (2004) underscores the\nimportance of equality of educational opportunity when it comes to\npreparation for the labor market. Ideally, the stakes attached to\neducation for labor market success would not be nearly as high as they\nare now, whereby a winner-takes-all competition for a job can\ndetermine an individual\u2019s access to social goods like\nhealthcare, leisure time, and discretionary income. When the\n(non-ideal) stakes are this high, equality of educational opportunity\nmatters all the more (Jacobs 2010).\n3.8 Equality of Educational Opportunity for Citizenship\n\nAnother important goal for providing educational opportunities is the\ndevelopment of students\u2019 capacities associated with being a good\ncitizen and maintaining democratic institutions over time (Callan\n1997; Galston 2001; Gutmann 1999). It might be argued that just as\nequality of opportunity to become a flourishing individual is a matter\nof justice, so too is equality of opportunity to develop civic skills,\nand to participate effectively in political deliberations.\n\nThe structure and appropriate content of civic education is debated\nextensively. While some argue that citizenship education can be\nnarrowly construed so as to not encroach upon individuals\u2019\nprivate commitments, others claim it is a far more demanding\neducational endeavor. A key part of this debate is the extent to which\neducation requires the cultivation of autonomy, and if does, the\nnature of the autonomy that is required. Some claim that since some\ngroups in pluralistic democracies reject the idea of an autonomous\nlife, education for autonomy cannot be imposed upon them even for\ncivic purposes, and so education should not entail the cultivation of\nindividual autonomy (Galston 1989). Rawls\u2019 own solution to the\npotential clash between civic education for autonomy and\nindividuals\u2019 private commitments is to advocate only a limited\nform of autonomy, political autonomy, which \u201cleaves untouched\nall kinds of doctrines\u2014religious, metaphysical, and moral\u201d\nand yields a relatively thin civic education (Rawls 2005: 375). Others\ntake issue with this view, arguing that civic education requires an\nencompassing form of autonomy that has unavoidable spillover effects\ninto the private sphere of individuals\u2019 lives, and that may\nclash with some religious convictions (Callan 1997; Gutmann 1995; see\nalso Arneson & Shapiro 1996, for a discussion of Wisconsin v.\nYoder (1972), a U.S. Supreme Court case about religious\nexemptions from compulsory education).\n\nAnother dimension of ongoing debates about equality in the realm of\ncivic education concerns the scope of the community for which we are\neducating students to become members. Is the right unit of analysis a\nparticular nation state or the global community? If it is a particular\nnation state, how can we cultivate in students a sense of their\nnational identity and the disposition to respect their state\u2019s\ninstitutions and laws (and to advocate reform when needed), while also\nmaking them sensitive to what they owe non-citizens as a matter of\njustice? A key component of this debate is whether students should\nreceive a patriotic civic education\u2014that is, one that\nprioritizes shoring up their allegiance to their state over their\ncapacity to reflect critically upon its potential shortcomings.\nGalston (1989) has notably argued that students need a civic education\nthat is more rhetorical than rational, while a number of liberal\ntheorists have criticized his view on grounds of democratic\nlegitimacy, its status-quo bias, and the related possibility of\nossifying existing inequalities (e.g., Brighouse 1998; Callan 1997;\nsee also the related entry on\n civic education).\n On the other hand, if we instead have a cosmopolitan view of civic\neducation and aim to cultivate \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d\n(e.g., Nussbaum & Cohen 1996), what are the relevant capacities\nthat need to be made effective? There is no world state for students\nto participate in.\n\nWhatever one believes about the appropriate scope and content of civic\neducation, a pressing issue is students\u2019 extremely uneven access\nto educational opportunities that prepare them for participatory\ncitizenship. Meira Levinson\u2019s work on the \u201ccivic\nachievement gap\u201d highlights this corollary to the much-more\ndiscussed achievement gap and underscores vast inequalities across\nstudent groups in terms of what youth know about how government works,\nand their ability to participate effectively in civic life (Levinson\n2012). These low rates of participation and engagement also have\nconsequences for how the interests of the poor are treated. Indeed,\neven if one rejects equality of opportunity in this domain, there is\nample evidence that many societies are not doing enough to enable\ntheir poorer and less educated citizens to effectively and competently\nparticipate in public life.\n3.9 Equality and Adequacy in the Distribution of Educational Opportunities\n\nA longstanding debate in the literature juxtaposes the view that we\nshould prioritize equality in the distribution of educational\nopportunities with the view that an \u201cadequacy\u201d approach is\nthe right one (on this debate, see Reich 2013). Those who advocate the\nequality view may insist on equal outputs (i.e., educational outcomes,\nlike the mastery of particular skills) or inputs (i.e., educational\nresources, like equal per pupil funding or qualified teachers). The\nadequacy view, by contrast, is seen as holding that what matters most\nis meeting a specified educational threshold.\n\nIn the context of school finance litigation in the U.S., advocates\noften invoke these two distributive ideals together rather than\nregarding them as being at odds (Rebell 2009: 21\u201322; Ryan 2008:\n1232\u20131238). Although most school finance litigation in the U.S.\ntoday is pursued from an adequacy framework given its greater\npolitical viability, litigators often make comparative claims about\nstudents\u2019 educational opportunities to bolster their case.\nConversely in contexts where lawyers pursue equality claims, they\nfrequently appeal to a conception of educational quality (e.g.,\nachieving literacy, numeracy, and civic skills) to anchor their\nclaims, and to avoid the leveling-down problem whereby equality is\nachieved by making everyone worse off, without regard for the\nrealization of particular educational goals.\n\nSome philosophical work has similarly undercut the sharp\nequality/adequacy distinction and shows how the two ideals are closely\nintertwined in the pursuit of educational justice. These approaches\n(e.g., Satz 2007; Anderson 2007) argue that adequacy in education has\na relative and comparative component because the educational threshold\ndepends on the knowledge and skills that others have, and so it is\nnecessarily a moving target. For example, what it takes to serve on a\njury, or to have an adequate opportunity for college, depends on the\nknowledge and skill levels of others. This \u201crelational\u201d\napproach to adequacy can respond to one of the strongest concerns\nproponents of equality raise: that because many of the benefits of\neducation are positional, which is to say, their value depends upon\none\u2019s position relative to others, equality is the right\ndistributive principle for educational opportunities. The meritocratic\ndistribution of jobs, where the most qualified candidate is appointed\n(rather than the individual who is merely well-qualified), ensures\nthat positionality is decisive in many cases. Conceptions of adequacy\nthat are attentive to relevant comparative claims can address this\nissue and thereby deflate the tension between adequacy and equality\napproaches to distributing educational opportunities.\n\nHowever one interprets equality of educational of opportunity, a\nnumber of important challenges face anyone who believes that the ideal\nis a crucial component of a fair and just society. Several of these\nchallenges are philosophical in nature. For instance, one can ask\nwhether certain values (e.g., respecting family autonomy) compete with\nthe demands of equality of opportunity in education in ways that trump\nor are trumped by concerns about educational equality. One can also\nask whether equal educational opportunity requires affirmative action,\nand what it may require for students with disabilities and special\neducational needs. One can accept equality of educational opportunity\nwith respect to some goods and adequacy of educational opportunity\nwith respect to others (Callan 2016). There are other challenges that\nare not philosophical but practical, such as how we can convince\npolicymakers to allocate sufficient funds to meet students\u2019\neducational needs, and how we might increase public support for the\nideal of equality of educational opportunity more generally.\n4. Equality of Educational Opportunity\u2019s Tensions with Other Values\n4.1 Education and the Family\n\nFamily background has long been recognized as a source of significant\ninequalities. Even before we consider that children have quite\ndifferent personalities and needs, inequality in family wealth and\ndifferences in family priorities and wield influence over a\nchild\u2019s prospects in the labor market, in civic participation,\nand in overall well-being. Although the number of parents who choose\nto pay tuition to have their children educated in private schools may\nbe relatively small, purchasing elite private schooling can result in\ncompounding advantages for some students (and thus relative\ndisadvantages for others). Only about 10% of primary and secondary\nstudents in the U.S. attend private schools (see NCES\u2019s the\nCondition of Education 2016 in\n Other Internet Resources),\n while students who attended private secondary schools have comprised\nnearly 30% or more of matriculating classes at some highly selective\nAmerican universities in recent years (see, for example, online\nprofiles of the 2016 freshman class at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale\nlisted in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Students at some public schools may also suffer more immediate\ndisadvantages from the absence of the positive peer effects of being\nin a school with higher achieving students and more engaged parents.\nSmaller class sizes, more highly qualified teachers, and more\nextra-curricular opportunities may enable private school students to\nbenefit from the compounding advantages of greater success in the\ncollege admissions process and subsequent labor market. And since\nemployment opportunities and elite college places are scarce goods\nthat are closely linked to other benefits in health, wealth, and\noverall well-being, these inequalities can be highly\nconsequential.\n\nWhile some of these inequalities might be remedied by social policies\nthat address employment practices, gender and racial inequality, and\nwealth inequality, we have reasons to think that some inequality in\nopportunity will remain in a just society simply because parents\nshould be able to treat their children differently from other\npeople\u2019s children in ways that are to their children\u2019s\nadvantage. For example, a parent may read bedtime stories to his\nchildren but if he does he does not also need to read them to other\nchildren, even if a failure to read to everyone exacerbates\ninequality. There are limits to what the state can do without\nintruding on the life of the family. At the same time, concern for\nmitigating inequality that is rooted in familial relations has to\ngrapple with the fact that different parenting styles have value as\nwell as downsides, and that the middle-class norm of trying to\nmaximize children\u2019s potential (\u201cconcerted\ncultivation\u201d; Lareau 2011) is no exception in terms of having\ncertain disadvantages for children.\n\nThere are several possible approaches to the conflict between equal\neducational opportunity and the family. One approach subordinates our\nconcern for equality of educational opportunity to our concern with\nthe family. To support this view we might try to argue that the goods\nof family life are especially weighty, or, that as a matter of value\npluralism, the state cannot impose complete uniformity on childrearing\npractices. Conversely, we could subordinate our concern for the family\nto our concern with equality of educational opportunity. If this were\nto happen, however, we could end up abolishing the family as we know\nit, since the family and partiality run contrary to equal opportunity.\nOne cannot, it seems, have the family and have perfect equality of\nopportunity. Plato famously advocated raising children in common\nwithin communities in The Republic (though not out of concern\nfor equality). But most philosophers, including Rawls, believe that\nabolishing the family is far too high a price to pay for equality\n(this is discussed in Munoz-Dard\u00e9 1999; Brighouse & Swift\n2009; Schoeman 1980; Schrag 1976; see also Miller 2009 on different\nconceptions of equality of opportunity and how the family fits within\nthem).\n\nAlternatively, we might think that some careful weighing of the values\nat stake is required. For instance, we might think that only some of\nthe demands of familial partiality, those related to intimacy such as\nreading bedtime stories, are sufficient to outweigh concern for\nequality of educational opportunity. Other aspects of familial\npartiality that appear to be unconnected to intimacy, such as paying\ntuition for private schools, would not be justified. This view would\nenjoin us to equalize children\u2019s educational opportunities\nwhenever we can, without sacrificing the goods central to the family\n(Brighouse & Swift 2014). Yet it can be very difficult in practice\nto determine whether an advantage parents provide their child is\nconstitutive of the family or not.\n4.2 Disability\n\nIndividuals with cognitive and physical disabilities have been\nmarginalized, denied resources, and even denied an education. Can a\nconception of equality of educational opportunity accommodate those\nwith cognitive and physical disabilities? Some critics claim that\ntheories of justice focus unduly on meeting the demands of reciprocity\nand cooperation as a pre-condition to equal opportunity and other\ndemands of justice, and in doing so, exclude some individuals with\ndisabilities from those entitlements. Some argue that we need new\ntheories (Kittay 1999; Barnes 2016) while others argue that existing\ntheories and approaches can be applied to or extended to include\nindividuals with disabilities (Stark 2013; Robeyns 2006; Brighouse\n2001). In education, treating individuals with disabilities the same\nas those without does not always suffice to treat all equally, for\ndisabilities sometimes give rise to special needs and requirements and\nthis raises challenges for \u2018inclusion\u2019 (Warnock 2005). In\norder to avoid these challenges it seems that we might need to endorse\ndifferential treatment, which can lead to stigma and division and has\nbeen associated with educational segregation. This gives rise to what\nhas been called the \u201cdilemma of difference\u201d and pertains\nto decisions about whether students with disabilities should be\neducated in the same class as students without disabilities. Placing\ndisabled children in mainstream schools or classes may lead to\nbullying, as Mary Warnock (2005) has noted, but placing disabled\nchildren in separate settings may further entrench the wide-spread\nsocial stigma associated with disability, even when there is much that\ncan be done to ensure disability is not an obstacle to learning.\nFurther debates focus on the extent to which (at least some of) the\ndisadvantages of disability may be detached from the disability itself\nand the extent to which they are attached only in virtue of social\norganization or social attitudes, which we could and should alter. For\ninstance, if the dominant modes of communication in our society were\nsign-based rather than spoken, perhaps deafness would not be\nconsidered a disability. Likewise, where braille translations are\nreadily available, the blind do not face a disability with respect to\nreading (Sparrow 2005). In the case of education, the design of the\nschool or the curriculum can determine whether a disability is an\nobstacle to learning. For some discussion of this debate see Terzi\n2005.\n\nDisability may be thought to pose problems for various conceptions of\nequality of educational opportunity and can strengthen well-known\nobjections. For example, it poses problems for those who endorse a\nmeritocratic allocation of advantageous positions, such as FEO. If one\nof the primary goals of an education system is to ensure fair\ncompetition for jobs, many people with disabilities will likely face\ngreater and even insurmountable obstacles to becoming the most\nmeritorious candidate. Recall that FEO requires equal prospects for\nthe equally naturally talented and ambitious. Some of those with\ndisabilities do not have similar or equal natural talent with others\nvying for opportunities, even if these differences could be\ncompensated for through education. Meritocratic equality of\nopportunity also appears to neglect some people with disabilities, by\ninterpreting merit in terms of inborn potentials. FEO and meritocratic\nequality of opportunity are consistent with providing very low or even\nno educational opportunities to some cognitively disabled persons, but\nthat hardly seems like an acceptable outcome. Adequacy accounts may\nalso struggle to explain what to do when disabilities are so severe\nthat individuals cannot achieve adequate educational levels, or do so\nonly at enormous cost. If an adequate education involved at least\nacquiring a high school diploma, it is not possible for some\ncognitively impaired persons to reach this level. Since the focus of\nadequacy is on achieving that level, and these people cannot do so, it\nappears that when educational adequacy is set at these levels no\nentitlement to education for the cognitively disabled can be derived\nfrom it. This sort of example puts a lot of pressure on accounts of\nadequacy to explain at what cost adequacy is worth pursuing, and also\nchallenge those who deny that native ability is relevant to equality\nof opportunity.\n\nOne way to avoid such outcome would be to supplement these views of\nequality or adequacy of educational opportunity with other principles.\nFor example, it might be held that we owe some educational resources\neven to the severely cognitively disabled not on grounds of equality\nof opportunity but on grounds of humanity.\n4.3 The Target of Equal Educational Opportunity: Individuals or Groups?\n\nOpportunities belong to agents. However, when we are concerned with\nequality of opportunity we may be concerned that each individual has\nthe same opportunities or that certain groups (classified by race,\ngender, socio-economic class, sexuality or religion) have the same\nopportunities. In other words, our concern may be that people\u2019s\nopportunities are not affected by their membership of some\ndisadvantaged group rather than being concerned that each individual\nhas equal opportunity within groups. Imagine two societies. In society\nA, all those who gain entrance to selective colleges on the\nbasis of test scores are white. In society B, all those who\ngain entrance on the basis of test scores are white or non-white in\nproportionate to their percentages in the overall population. Should\nwe care about whether we are in society A or B? If\nour concern is with individuals alone, then so long as our conception\nof equality of opportunity is met, then there is no difference between\nsociety A and B. Of course, we may suspect that\nsociety A violates our conception of equality of opportunity.\nBut suppose that it does not.\n\nDo we have any reason to favor a college admissions policy that moves\nus from A to B? Those who advocate for affirmative\naction in admissions argue that we have reason to depart from a\ncolor-blind standard. Some of those arguments appeal to the\nillegitimacy of the standards used (e.g., tests scores), which critics\nsay are biased. Others argue that we should expect to see equality of\noutcomes with respect to relevant social groups. For example, John\nRoemer (1998) defends a conception of equality of opportunity\naccording to which members of groups that have been subordinated\n(women, racial minorities) should have the same probabilities of\nachieving success as the members of the dominant group. This is\nbecause he thinks the obstacles these groups face should be the same\nand if we assume that they have equal distributions of talent within\nthem, then different outcomes means there are different obstacles.\nRoemer uses the example of smoking to illustrate this. Smoking rates\nvary by social class: the poorer you are, the more likely it is that\nyou will smoke. On Roemer\u2019s view, this means that it is harder\nfor a poor person to stop smoking than a wealthy person. So we should\nnot penalize a poor person who smokes to the same extent that we\npenalize a wealthy person. Of course, which social groups should be\nincluded in this exercise is controversial. Conservatives and liberals\ndiffer as to whether individuals face different obstacles simply by\nvirtue of their group membership.\n\nA different argument for moving to society B is given by\nGlenn Loury (1987) who argues that the dynamic effects of a society\nlike A would prevent poor but talented minorities from\nachieving equality of educational opportunity because they would lack\naccess to the social networks upon which jobs and other opportunities\ndepend. In society A, disadvantages would cluster. Because\nequality of opportunity does not, as we have seen, easily extend to\nthe private sphere of family and intimate associations, it is\ncompatible with the continued practice of racial discrimination in\nsuch practices, even when there is legal, formal equality.\n\nLoury thus sees a role for preferential policies in higher education\nthat would move us from a society like A to a society like\nB. One of the more controversial reforms associated with\nhigher education and equality of opportunity is affirmative action,\nwhich reserves preferential treatment for historically disadvantaged\ngroups. Affirmative action has been criticized by those who think that\nmerit, and not race or class, should be the only criterion for\nselecting college applicants. Others argue that it can lead to the\nunintended stigmatization of members of disadvantaged groups who\nattend college as not deserving of their place. However, this is to\nforget that opportunities to develop merit are themselves unfairly\ndistributed between groups historically. Notwithstanding this\nresponse, affirmative action remains a controversial response to a\nvery difficult social problem (Guinier 2016).\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has provided analysis of key positions in debates about\nequality of educational opportunity. We began by describing the\nreasons for being concerned about equality in this arena and then\nsurveyed debates about the value and distribution of such\nopportunities. As the above discussion highlights, the realization of\nthe ideal of equality of educational opportunity may be frustrated by\ncompeting conceptions of what equality itself entails, and also by\nother important values that are in tension with equalizing education\nopportunities (e.g., respecting family autonomy). Social scientific\nadvances in recent years have clarified our understanding of the\nmechanisms behind children\u2019s unequal access to educational\nopportunities, and the consequences of those inequalities for social\nmobility (e.g., Chetty et al. 2014; Duncan & Murnane 2011). This\nknowledge enables policymakers to target interventions to areas that\nwill be most impactful (e.g., growing recognition of the importance of\nearly childhood education). But value tensions of the sort highlighted\nin this entry will persist, and they warrant ongoing attention by\nphilosophers as our understanding of the causes and consequences of\neducational inequalities sharpens.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, Larry A., 1985, \u201cFair Equality of Opportunity:\nJohn Rawls\u2019 (Best) Forgotten Principle\u201d, <em>Philosophy\nResearch Archives</em>, 11: 197\u2013208.\ndoi:10.5840/pra19851111", "Anderson, Elizabeth S., 1999, \u201cWhat Is the Point of\nEquality?\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 109(2): 287\u2013337.\ndoi:10.1086/233897", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2007, \u201cFair Opportunity in Education:\nA Democratic Equality Perspective\u201d, <em>Ethics</em>, 117(4):\n595\u2013622. doi:10.1086/518806", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2010, <em>The Imperative of\nIntegration</em>, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.", "Arneson, Richard J., 1999, \u201cAgainst Rawlsian Equality of\nOpportunity\u201d, <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 93(1):\n77\u2013112. doi:10.1023/A:1004270811433", "Arneson, Richard and Ian Shapiro, 1996, \u201cDemocratic Autonomy\nand Religious Liberty: A Critique of Wisconsin v.
