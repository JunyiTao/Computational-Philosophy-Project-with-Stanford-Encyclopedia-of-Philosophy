    "main_text": "The Use of Religious Language || Analogy and Metaphor\n3.1 Analogy and Metaphor\n\nThe two main kinds of non-literal discourse that have been seen as\nparticularly important in religion are analogy and\n metaphor.[4]\n Analogy relates to the use of expressions that occur in both\nreligious and non-religious contexts. Take, for example, the\nexpressions \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cwise\u201d and\n\u201cpowerful\u201d when used in ordinary contexts to talk about\npeople. Do these expressions have the same meaning when used to talk\nabout God, or are they used analogously: is the conventional meaning\nthey have when used to talk about mundane objects in some way modified\nwhen used to talk about God? Discussion of religious analogy was\nparticularly lively in early medieval theology and Aquinas was a\nleading proponent of an analogical treatment of religious predicates.\nSee Roger M. White (2010) for a detailed account of Aquinas\u2019\ntheory, its background in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as well as\nsubsequent ideas about analogy in religion in the work of Karl Barth\nand Immanuel Kant.\n\nA detailed contemporary account of analogy by Richard Swinburne (1993:\nch. 4) proposes that analogical use of a term involves a modification\nof its syntactic and/or semantic rules. A syntactic rule for the use\nof a term p sets down general conditions governing its use. A\nsemantic rule for p gives examples of the things to which\np correctly applies, or does not correctly apply. For instance,\ngiving a semantic rule for red might involve pointing to\nvarious examples of red objects and contrasting them with objects that\nare not red (1993: 58). In using an expression analogically, Swinburne\nproposes, its semantic or syntactic rules are loosened. So W*, the\nanalogical use of a predicate W, may require a less strict\ndegree of resemblance to standard examples of W for its correct\nuse. Swinburne believes that \u201cperson\u201d which in its\nordinary sense has living human beings with physical bodies as its\nstandard examples, must be used analogically with a suitable weakening\nof its semantic rules and modification of its syntactic rules when\napplied to God.\n\nIt is notable that on Swinburne\u2019s theory analogy can be seen as\na commonplace feature of language use that is both compatible with a\nface value theory and found much more widely than in religious\ndiscourse. For example, consider the following utterances:\n\n(10)The lawn is\nsquare.\n(11)The audience was\nsilent.\n\n\nLawns do not, of course, have four sides of equal length and in saying\n(11) the speaker does not mean that the audience was not making any\nnoise whatsoever. According to modern pragmatic theories of\ninterpretation (such as Sperber & Wilson 1986; Carston 2002;\nRecanti 2004), constituent expressions or concepts undergo an ad hoc\nmodification prompted by the context in which they are uttered and\nunderstood. For instance, (10) might involve a loosening of the\nconcept SQUARE, i.e., SQUARE* that includes not just objects that are\nsquare but also objects (like lawns) that look square or are\napproximately square. Akin to Swinburne\u2019s account of rule\nmodification in analogy, the condition that squares have four sides of\nequal length and internal angles of ninety degrees is relaxed.\nUnderstood in this way, however, analogy is not distinctive of\nreligious discourse but a prevalent characteristic of normal\ncommunication. When God is the subject matter, expressions undergo a\nsuitable ad hoc loosening as part of normal, literal\ncommunication.\n\nRecent research has focused more on religious\n metaphors.[5]\n The importance of metaphor has long been noted by theologians, with\nSally McFague (1983) offering the most extensive treatment, while in\nthe philosophy of religion William Alston (1989: ch. 1 and 2), Janet\nSoskice (1985), Anthony Kenny (2005) and Richard Swinburne (1991: ch.\n3; 1993: ch. 4 and 5)\nhave all contributed to the discussion.\n\nSince metaphors are commonplace in various areas of discourse, it may\nseem that questions about religious metaphor should be\nsubsumed under questions about metaphor in general raised in the\nphilosophy of language. However, some have proposed that what is said\nabout God is irreducibly metaphorical. Tillich\u2019s (1951)\ntheory that religious language is symbolic is perhaps an early\nexpression of the view, and Anthony Kenny and Sally McFague are more\nrecent proponents of a view of this type (see also J\u00fcngel 1974;\nSarot 1992). William Alston, the chief critic of the theory, offers\nthe following statement of irreducibility theory (1989:\n17\u201319):\n\n(IT)Religious metaphors\nare the only way of stating truths about God, and the content of a\nmetaphorical utterance about God cannot be stated, even in part, in\nliteral terms.\n\n\nAlston sees the supporter of IT as construing even apparently literal\nclaims about God as metaphorical. However, Alston\u2019s formulation\nmay be overly modest, since both Kenny and McFague seem to take the\nview that all talk of God is irreducibly metaphorical,\nirrespective of whether it is true or false.\n\nIT fails, according to Alston, because metaphors, religious metaphors\nin particular, are always in principle susceptible to literal\nparaphrase. Scott (2013: 180\u2013182) argues that IT, on any\nplausible account of what metaphors are, faces insurmountable\nproblems. For example, according to one standard theory (Searle 1993),\nmetaphors say something that is usually patently false with the aim of\nimplying something other than the false thing that is said.\n\u201cGod is my rock\u201d, for instance, might imply that God is a\nsource of confidence for the speaker. However, it follows from IT that\nif a metaphor about God implies anything true about God then that\nimplied claim should also be metaphorical. This appears to undermine\ntruthful communication about God. If, however, talk of God is not in\nthe business of expressing truths, according to what norm are\nutterances about God affirmed or rejected? Metaphor theories therefore\nface challenges in specifying and defending the irreducibility claim\nas well as in as well as elaborating what a metaphor is.\n",
