    "main_text": "Argumentation and Logic || Limitations of the Methods\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nIn later Mohist philosophy, we see ancient Chinese thinkers making\nremarkable advances in ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,\nand informal logic. In each of these areas, the Mohists develop\ncredible, even brilliant theories and discover philosophical problems\nthat they grapple with vigorously, if not always fully successfully.\nTheir ethical theory is a tremendous achievement: history\u2019s\nfirst explicit form of indirect consequentialism, grounded in a\nconception of benefit or welfare as what produces happiness. Their\nnaturalistic semantic theory and epistemology offer an intriguing,\nnon-mentalistic approach to language, mind, and knowledge, one that\ndeserves further attention today. They pioneer the study of logic in\nChina and develop an interesting theory of analogical argumentation,\nthough making only limited progress in exploring cogency in analogical\nextension. And this is not to mention their investigations in\nmetaphysics, mechanics, optics, and geometry. Regrettably, the\nMohists\u2019 multifaceted inquiries came to an end as their movement\nfaded away during the first century of the former Han dynasty (206\nB.C.E.\u20138 C.E.). Interest in issues inspired by language arose\nagain among a few intellectuals during the later Han (25\u2013220\nC.E.) and the Wei-Jin period (220\u2013589 C.E.), but in ethical\ntheory, language, logic, and epistemology, later Chinese thinkers\nnever surpassed the achievements of their classical forebears.\n",
