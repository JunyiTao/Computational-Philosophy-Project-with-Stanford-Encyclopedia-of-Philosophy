    "main_text": "Sabbatei Zevi: Mystical Messiah and the Centrality of Messianism\n4. Sabbatei Zevi: Mystical Messiah and the Centrality of Messianism\n\n\nFor Scholem Jewish messianism and Sabbateanism are intimately\nconnected. This is not because Sabbateanism is the only form of Jewish\nmessianism but because Sabbateanism represents, for him, the\nquintessence of the tension between tradition and its self-destruction\nthat lies at the root of all forms of Jewish messianism reaching back\nto the Hebrew Bible. This idea came to Scholem very early in his\ncareer, decades before he even began serious work on his magisterial\nSabbatai Zevi: Mystical Messiah. He was first made aware of\nSabbateanism by his friend Zalman Rubashov probably between 1916\u20131918,\nbut he didn't begin research on the movement until 1927 and\npublished his first article on the Marrano Sabbatean Abraham Miguel\nCardozo \u201cDie Theologie des Sabbatianismus im Lichte Abraham\nCardosos\u201d in 1928. This was followed by the more important\ntheoretical study \u201cRedemption though Sin\u201d published in\n1936. In this essay Scholem posits what would become his central claim\nabout messianism and tradition. First, that there are essentially two\nkinds of messianism; restorative and utopian-catastrophic. Both of\nthese are manifest in the singular movement of Sabbateanism. The\nrestorative model envisioned the messianic as a return to an older era\n(i.e., the Davidic kingdom) that was revolutionary but only within the\nconfines of the tradition. The utopian-catastrophic model (Scholem also\ncalls it apocalyptic) envisions a rupture of tradition and the\ninauguration of an entirely new era. While these models existed before\nSabbateanism, the restorative model in the Maimonidean messianism and\nthe utopian model in the messianic theology of the anonymous\n14th century Sefer Temunah and later apocalyptic\nmystics such as David Reuveni, only in Sabbateanism do they both emerge\nfully as \u201cdark forces\u201d that affect, and threaten, the\nentire Jewish nation. Moreover, once these forces are unleashed \u2014\nespecially in a traditional world whose authority had already been\nweakened \u2014 they can never again be totally suppressed, even\nthough the formal Sabbatean movement loses much of its direct influence\nby the 18th century either through attrition or religious\nconservatism. That is, for Scholem, Sabbateanism is such an important\ntopic precisely because it re-directs Jewish history by exposing the\nunderside of Jewish mysticism, Judaism's\n\u201ccounter-history,\u201d in a way that creates the conditions for\nJewish modernity, including Zionism. In this sense, Sabbateanism is the\nlynchpin to Scholem's entire intellectual project.\n\n\nThe Sabbatean heresy did not emerge in a vacuum. There are many\ntheories about why it became as popular as it did. Scholem's\ngeneral approach is that while Kabbala, like all intellectual\nconstructs, reacts to history, it is the esoteric trends that are often\nthe most potent forces needed to unleash innovation, which is often\ndeemed heretical (at least at the outset). Thus the roots of\nSabbateanism were not the impoverished or oppressed state of the Jews\n(although these factors may have played a role) but the dominance of\nLurianic Kabbala born in mid-16th century Safed. Scholem\nnotes that the messianic in Lurianism was not apocalyptic and may even\nhave been a conservative protest again utopian messianists like Reuveni\na generation earlier. Lurianism offered a gradual progressive\nmessianism of tikkun or the reparation of the broken cosmos\nbuilt on the foundations of its theory of creation as rupture and\nexile. Yet Lurianism also rose at a time (a generation after the\nSpanish expulsion) when Jews were in need of a new theology to justify\ntheir new reality. The fact that the Ottoman Sultan Bayazid II invited\nJews to re-settle Erez Israel after 1516 and the fact that Lurianic\nKabbala arose in Safed, one of the four holy cites according to\ntradition (the others are Jerusalem, Hebron, and Tiberias) gave added\nheft to its messianic teachings. In short, according to Scholem, with\nLurianic Kabbala, Kabbala emerged from its subterranean \u2014 and\nlargely conservative\u2014existence (or at least without a\nformidable competitor) and set the stage for the antinomian\ncounter-traditional dimensions of Kabbala to erupt and gain popular\nattention. There are at least three factors that contributed to\nLurianism's success and subsequently the success of Sabbateanism:\n(1) the weakening of rabbinic authority in the sixteenth-century (even\nconsidering that the same locale and same decades gave us the\nShulkhan Arukh); (2) the lack of any viable ideological\ncompetitor with the demise of philosophy after the expulsion; and\n(3)Luria's comprehensive and compelling myth coupled with the\npositive historical development of the first systematic, albeit slow,\nre-settlement of Jews in Erez Israel since the early Middle Ages.\n\n\nWhat Lurianism did not offer was a charismatic messianic figure to\nfinalize its messianic vision. Here is where Sabbateanism found its\nrole. Scholem notes that Nathan of Gaza, Sabbatai Zevi's prophet\nand spokesperson, largely nullified the need for continued Lurianic\npractice once the \u201cmessiah\u201d was revealed. Not unlike\nPaul's view of the law, for Nathan once the messiah arrived\none's faith must now be focused on his role in finalizing the\nprocess. In fact, culminating the process required the messiah to break\nthe law in order to redeem his people, thus opening the\n\u201ccounter-historical\u201d notion of antinomianism that lay\ndormant in so much of mystical Jewish doctrine.\n\n\nAfter Sabbatai Zevi's decision, under duress, to convert to Islam\nand remain under the protection of the Sultan (where he died a decade\nlater) his disciples split into \u201cmoderate\u201d and\n\u201cradical\u201d camps. The moderates held that they should remain\nJews, even observant ones, and keep their faith in Sabbatai Zevi as a\nsecret doctrine. The \u201cradicals\u201d held they must imitate\ntheir master and thus convert to Islam to continue the redemptive\nprocess. Included in this radical camp was Jacob Frank (1726\u20131791)\n(about whom Scholem had little to say) who, with most of his disciples,\nconverted to Catholicism in 1759. The radicals did not present much of\na problem for the Jews as they disappeared from the community. The\nmoderates, however, presented a grave problem and inspired a whole\nindustry of Sabbatean hunting that extended into the 19th\ncentury. The point in all this, according to Scholem, is that\nSabbateanism destroyed Jewish tradition from within a century before\nthe Enlightenment, and may have even brought the latter into\nexistence.\n",
