    "main_text": "Arguments against svabh\u0101va || Language and truth\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe preceding discussion has discussed some of the main topics\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna addresses in order to refute their existence by\nsvabh\u0101va: causation, change, the self, knowledge,\nlanguage, and truth. This is not a comprehensive exposition of the\nMadhyamaka view, however, not just because there are aspects of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought we have not mentioned here (such\nhas his discussion of time and his account of ethics), but because\nMadhyamaka thought regards itself as a philosophical antidote against\nsuperimpositions of svabh\u0101va wherever they arise. It is\ntherefore by necessity more comprehensive than the arguments found in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. They provide examples of\nargumentative procedures and discussions of putative examples of\nsvabh\u0101va prominent amongst N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nopponents. But the Madhyamaka project consists not just in the\nexplanation and defense of these arguments (even though most of the\npositions N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues against are of more than\nhistorical importance) but has to be continued in the debate with the\ndefenders of svabh\u0101va in the contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion. It is apparent that Madhyamaka philosophy is opposed to\nthe brand of realism currently found in much of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy (Michael Devitt (1997: 41) characterizes this succinctly as\nthe claim that \u2018most current common-sense and scientific\nphysical existence statements are objectively and mind-independently\n(deflationary) true\u2019). Things that exist in a mind-independent\nmanner exist with svabh\u0101va, even though they might be\ndependent in all other kinds of ways. (Even if everything out there\ndepended on every other thing, as long as the entire network of\ndependence-relations was mind-independent it would exist with\nsvabh\u0101va). Of course the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s talk of\n\u201cmind-dependence\u201d does not refer to dependence on any\nindividual mind, as a solipsist would assume, but to collective\ndependence on all the minds there are. This view raises a variety of\ninteresting questions that Madhyamaka philosophy has to address.\n\nFirst of all there is the question of how to make sense of objects\nlike Mt Everest depending on all our minds collectively. It is clear\nhow we could say something like this about things existing merely by\nthe force of convention, such as some objects traded on the stock\nmarket. But how could something like a mountain be merely\nconventionally existent?\n\nSecondly, given the Madhyamaka rejection of a correspondence-theoretic\naccount of truth, how can it come up with a theory of meaning and\ntruth that is not committed to some sort of structural isomorphism\nbetween word and world but still gives us a robust account of what\ndistinguishes true from false sentences?\n\nThirdly, if it is not facts out there that settle what is true how can\nthe M\u0101dhyamika avoid the unacceptable relativistic conclusion\nthat we cannot criticize epistemic or ethical practices which differ\nfrom ours?\n\nFourthly, how can we make sense of an ontology without foundations in\nwhich there are no substantially existent objects on which everything\nelse depends? (For an interesting formal model of such an ontology see\nPriest 2009, 2014. This question has obvious systematics connections\nwith the current discussion of\n grounding.)\n\nMany aspects of these questions have been addressed in vast body of\ncommentarial literature that was written in the nearly two millennia\nsince N\u0101g\u0101rjuna composed his key philosophical works. Other\nstill remain to be addressed. (For some development of contemporary\nMadhyamaka ideas in relation to contemporary Western philosophy see\nGarfield 2015, Westerhoff 2020.) One of these is the question to which\nextent Madhyamaka thought is essentially linked to Buddhism. This is a\nquestion that has attracted more interest recently especially from\nresearchers that study Madhyamaka primarily as a philosophical, rather\nthan as a religious tradition. (For some interesting reflections on\nmatter this see McGuire 2017). If we consider the lively status of\nMadhyamaka studies today it seems evident that the questions\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna asked and the system of philosophy he founded in\nthe second century remain very much alive in the twenty-first.\n",
