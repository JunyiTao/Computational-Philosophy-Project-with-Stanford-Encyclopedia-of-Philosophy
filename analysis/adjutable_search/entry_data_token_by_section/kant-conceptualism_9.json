    "main_text": "Points of Dispute\n5. Points of Dispute\n\nThis section canvasses eight different areas of dispute between\ncontemporary interpreters of Kant concerning the contributions of\nsensibility and intellect to cognition. Each dispute is presented in\nterms of the second, dependence, frame (i.e Intellectualism vs.\nSensibilism). However, proponents of the first, content, frame (i.e.,\nConceptualism vs. Nonconceptualism) will also see these different\nareas of dispute as relevant, given that many of their concerns remain\nin the motivation for holding one form or another of Intellectualism.\nThat said, particularly important points of discrepancy between the\ntwo frames\u2019 approaches to the issues will be noted below.\n",
