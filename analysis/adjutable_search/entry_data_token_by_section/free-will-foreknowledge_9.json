    "main_text": "Logical fatalism\n4. Logical fatalism\n\nA form of fatalism that is even older than theological fatalism is\nlogical fatalism, the thesis that the past truth of a proposition\nabout the future entails fatalism. Aristotle discusses this form of\nfatalism in his famous Sea Battle Argument, mentioned in section\n 2.1\n above. A clearer and more sophisticated form of the argument was\nproposed by Diodorus Cronus, whose argument is remarkably similar in\nform to our basic argument for theological fatalism. The logical\nfatalist argument parallels our basic argument as follows:\nArgument for logical fatalism\nLet S = the proposition that there will be a sea battle\ntomorrow.\n\n(1L) Yesterday it was\ntrue that S. [assumption]\n(2L) If some\nproposition was true in the past, it is now-necessary that it was true\nthen. [Form of the Necessity of the Past]\n(3L) It is\nnow-necessary that yesterday it was true that S. [1,\n2]\n(4L) Necessarily, if\nyesterday it was true that S, then now it is true that\nS. [omnitemporality of truth]\n(5L) If it is\nnow-necessary that p and if necessarily (p then\nq), then it is now-necessary that q. [Transfer of Necessity\nPrinciple]\n(6L) Therefore, it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S. [3L, 4L,\n5L]\n(7L) If it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S, no alternative to\nthe truth of S is now-possible. [definition of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d]\n(8L) So no alternative\nto the truth of S is now-possible [6L, 7L] \n(9L) If no alternative\nto the truth of a proposition about the future is now-possible, then\nwhat the proposition is about will not be brought about by free human\nchoice. [Version of Principle of Alternate Possibilities]\n(10L) Hence, the sea\nbattle tomorrow will not be brought about by free human choice. [8L,\n9L]\n\n\nUnlike the argument for theological fatalism, the argument for logical\nfatalism has few defenders. One reason is that (2L) is less plausible\nthan (2). (3L) is a soft fact about the past, if anything is.\nNevertheless, some philosophers, like Susan Haack (1974) and William\nLane Craig (1987), have maintained that theological fatalism is just a\ngussied up version of logical fatalism, and that the former is no more\nimpressive than the latter once one looks past the theological\nwindow-dressing. This seems to be Merricks\u2019 (2009) position as\nwell, since he holds that theological fatalism fails for essentially\nthe same reason as logical fatalism. Warfield (1997) has argued for\nthe equivalence of the two forms of fatalism if God is necessarily\nexistent and essentially omniscient. Responses have been given by\nHasker (1998) and Brueckner (2000), and Warfield (2000) offers a\nrejoinder to both. Hunt (2002) links Warfield\u2019s argument with\nPlantinga\u2019s (1986), discussed in\n 2.4,\n inasmuch as both exploit the logical equivalence of propositions\nabout the contingent future with God\u2019s believing those\npropositions, and argues that they both fall prey to the same\nreductio: the closure principles they invoke (closure of consistency\nunder logical equivalence for Warfield, closure of hard/soft facthood\nunder logical equivalence for Plantinga) would equally support the\ncompatibility of free will with divine determinism, an unacceptable\nresult for a libertarian. Peter Graham (2008) argues that the\nconsensus about consistency to which Warfield appeals emerged against\nthe backdrop of an assumption that there is no necessarily existent\nbeing, and is therefore question-begging.\n5. Beyond theological fatalism\n\nThere\u2019s more at stake here than the coherence of libertarian\ntheism, as evidenced by the many non-libertarians and non-theists who\nhave contributed to the debate. A comparison might be helpful.\nThere\u2019s more at stake in Zeno\u2019s Achilles paradox than the\nfleetness of Achilles and the torpidity of tortoises. If that\u2019s\nall there was to it, the discovery that Achilles was actually a\nquadraplegic, or that the tortoises of ancient Greece were as fast as\njack rabbits, would resolve the puzzle. But that would simply exempt\nAchilles and/or the tortoise from complicity in the problem; it would\ndo nothing to address the real issues presented by Zeno\u2019s\nargument. The situation is arguably the same when it comes to the\nargument for theological fatalism (Hunt 2017a). If the argument\ngets God wrong by assuming that he\u2019s in time when he\nisn\u2019t, the problem possibly goes away for God, once the mistake\nis corrected, but it\u2019s easily reinstated by replacing God with\nGud, an infallibly omniscient being who exists in time. If the\nargument gets human beings wrong by assuming that they have\n(libertarian) free will when they don\u2019t, the problem can be\nreformulated in terms of Gud\u2019s infallible beliefs about the\nfuture actions of Eleutherians, a race of extraterrestrials stipulated\nto possess libertarian freedom. This is to understand the argument for\ntheological fatalism as a thought experiment. Whether or not divine\nforeknowledge and libertarian freedom are real, we\u2019re being\nasked, what if? Could libertarian freedom really be incompatible with\ndivine foreknowledge for the reasons given in the argument?\nThe answer to this question may involve rethinking more than God and\nfree will.\n\nZagzebski has argued that the dilemma of theological fatalism is\nbroader than a problem about free will. The modal or causal asymmetry\nof time, a transfer of necessity principle, and the supposition of\ninfallible foreknowledge are mutually inconsistent. (1991, appendix).\nIf there is a distinct kind of necessity that the past has\nqua past, and which is not an implicit reference to the lack\nof causability of the past, then it is temporally asymmetrical. The\npast has it and the future does not. The necessity of the past and the\ncontingency of the future are two sides of the same coin. To say that\nthe future is contingent in the sense of temporal modality does not\nimply that we have causal control over the entire future, of course.\nWe lack control over part of the future because part (or even all) of\nit is causally necessary. But if the necessity of the past is distinct\nfrom the lack of causability, and is a type of necessity the past has\njust because it is past, the future must lack that particular kind of\nnecessity.\n\nThe idea that there is temporally asymmetrical modality is\ninconsistent with the transfer of necessity principle and the\nsupposition of infallible foreknowledge of an essentially omniscient\ndeity. The inconsistency can be demonstrated as follows:\n\nDilemma of Foreknowledge and Modal Temporal Asymmetry\n\nAgain, let T = the proposition that you will answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am.\n\n(1f) There is (and was\nbefore now) an essentially omniscient foreknower (EOF) [Assumption for\ndilemma]\n\n\n(1f) and the Principle of the Necessity of the Past tells us that\n\n(2f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed T before now or it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed not T before now.\n\n\n\nFrom (1f) and the definition of an EOF it follows that\n\n(3f) Necessarily (The\nEOF believed before now that T \u2192 T), and\nnecessarily (The EOF believed before now that not T \u2192\nnot T). \n\n\nBy the Transfer of Necessity Principle (TNP), (2f) and (3f) entail\n\n(4f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that T or it is now-necessary that not\nT.\n\n\n(4f) is logically equivalent to\n\n(5f) Either it is not\nnow-possible that T or it is not now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nFrom the Principle of the Contingency of the Future we get\n\n(6f) It is now-possible\nthat T and it is now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nBut (6f) contradicts (5f).\n\nThe inconsistency shown in this argument has nothing to do with free\nwill or fatalism. In fact, the problem is even more general than this\nargument illustrates. The reason essential omniscience conflicts with\ntemporal modality and the transfer principle is that the existence of\nan EOF requires that a proposition about the past entails a\nproposition about the future. But it straightforwardly follows from\nTNP that a proposition that is now-necessary cannot entail a\nproposition that is not now-necessary. So if the past is now-necessary\nand the future is not, a proposition about the past cannot entail a\nproposition about the future. The conclusion is that if asymmetrical\ntemporal modality is coherent, it can obey TNP, or it can permit a\nproposition about the past to entail a proposition about the future,\nbut not both.\n\nThe root of the problem, then, is that it is impossible for there to\nbe a type of modality that has the following features:\n\n(a) The past and future\nare asymmetrical in that the past qua past is necessary with respect\nto this type of modality, whereas the future qua future is contingent\nwith respect to this type of modality.\n(b) There are\npropositions about the past that entail propositions about the future.\n\n(c) TNP\nobtains.\n\n\nSo the problem of the alleged incompatibility of infallible\nforeknowledge and free will is a special case of a more general\nproblem about time and necessity. It was suggested in section\n 2.6\n that the problem may be (a) above. There is no temporally\nasymmetrical necessity. But regardless of what one thinks of fatalist\narguments, the general problem in the logic of time and causation\nneeds to be addressed. Both the alleged modal asymmetry of time and\nthe causal asymmetry should be examined in more detail.\n\nThe problem of foreknowledge and fatalism has been around for a long\ntime, but the amount of philosophical attention it has attracted since\n1965 is truly remarkable. The literature on this problem is enormous,\nand it continues to grow. ",
