    "main_text": "The Completeness Question\n2. The Completeness Question\n\nHow should we approach the completeness question? In the history of\nattempts to answer this question, people have tended to adopt one of\ntwo strategies. One appeals to (what philosophers call) modal\nnotions, where a modal notion here means a notion connected to\npossibility and necessity, to what might or must be the case. Another\nappeals to non-modal notions, that is, notions distinct from\nideas about possibility and necessity. There is a wide variety of such\nnotions, though perhaps the most obvious one is identity in\nthe logical sense, according to which if x is identical to y, then\nevery property of x is a property of y. This notion has consequences\nfor possibility and necessity, but it is not itself modal. Other\nnon-modal notions include realization, or grounding,\nwhich we will consider below.\n\nIn practice, most formulations of physicalism include both\nmodal and non-modal elements at some level. Proponents of modal\nformulations often end up appealing to something non-modal in the\ncourse of elaborating and defending their view. Non-modal versions are\nusually interpreted so that they have the same modal consequences as\nmodal versions. Nevertheless, the issue of whether to answer the\ncompleteness question by appealing to modal or non-modal ideas has\nproved as controversial as any in the literature on what physicalism\nis (for overviews, see Rabin 2020, Elpidorou 2018a, Tiehen 2018). In\nwhat follows, we will first look at an influential modal answer to the\ncompleteness question, which appeals to supervenience, and\nthen turn to several non-modal alternatives.\n",
