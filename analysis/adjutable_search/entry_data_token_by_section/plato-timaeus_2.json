Relation of the Timaeus to other Platonic Dialogues\n\nThe question of the place of the Timaeus relative to the\nother dialogues has given rise to an acrimonious but nevertheless\nfruitful debate, with far-ranging implications for our assessment of\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. In 1953, G. E. L. Owen published a\nprovocative article that challenged the orthodox view of the\nTimaeus as a work written during Plato\u2019s so called\n\u201clate\u201d period, and argued that it should be regarded as a\nmiddle dialogue instead, composed prior to the Theaetetus and\nthe Parmenides. Owen claimed to see in the Timaeus a\nreassertion of several metaphysical views familiar from the\nRepublic but (on the reading proposed by Owen) subsequently\nexposed for refutation in these two dialogues, both of which on the\northodox view precede the Timaeus. The orthodox view was\nbased on long-standing tradition, but had been confirmed by the\nstylometric studies of Plato\u2019s writings undertaken by late\nnineteenth- and early twentieth-century philologists. Owen called into\nquestion the assumptions and the results of these studies. Four years\nlater Owen\u2019s criticism of stylometry, as well as his\ninterpretation of the relevant arguments in the Theaetetus\nand the Parmenides, were in turn vigorously if not\nrancorously disputed by H. F. Cherniss in defense of the traditional\nview (Cherniss 1965, 1977). This debate between these two scholars of\nrenown whose approaches to the study of Plato\u2019s dialogues were\nso markedly different did much to bring a new level of acuity to the\nanalysis of Platonic texts. Over time the orthodox view appears to\nhave held its own. Both a more nuanced examination of the texts and\nmore recent computer-assisted stylometric studies have done much to\nreinforce\n it.[7]\n\nThe opening of the Timaeus, depicting it as a sequel to a\nconversation about the ideal city-state that resembles the\nkallipolis of the Republic in important points,\nconnects the project announced in the Timaeus to the\nRepublic. This opening also presents the Critias as\na sequel to the Timaeus. And Socrates\u2019 request in the\nPhaedo to provide teleological causes for the explanation of\nthe world, instead of the material causes employed in the cosmologies\nof the Presocratics (97b-99b), is answered by Timaeus\u2019\naccount of the rational cause of the universe (the Timaeus,\nhowever, points out that the material causes of the Phaedo\nalso have to be considered in order to explain the perceptible world).\n\n",
