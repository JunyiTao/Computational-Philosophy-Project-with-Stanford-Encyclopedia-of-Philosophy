    "main_text": "Political community || Common good\n5.1 Common good\n\n\u201cCommon good\u201d is very often a safer translation of\nbonum commune than \u201cthe common good\u201d. For there\nis the common good of a team, but equally the common good of a\nuniversity class, of a university, of a family, of a neighborhood, of\na city, of a state, of a church and of human kind throughout the\nworld. The difference in each case between the group\u2019s common\ngood and an aggregate of the wellbeing of each of its members can be\nunderstood by considering how, in a real friendship, A wills B\u2019s\nwellbeing for B\u2019s sake, while B wills A\u2019s wellbeing for\nA\u2019s sake, and each therefore has reason to will his or her own\nwellbeing for the other\u2019s sake, with the result that neither\nenvisages his or her own wellbeing as the source (the object) of the\nfriendship\u2019s value, and each has in view a truly common\ngood, not reducible to the good of either taken separately or merely\nsummed. Inasmuch as there is possible and appropriate a kind of\nfriendship between the members of each of the kinds of group listed\n(non-exhaustively) above, each such group has its own common good.\n5.1.1 Groups\n\nCommunities such as those just mentioned are groups, each of them a\nwhole [totum] made up of persons (and perhaps of other\ngroups), their unity being not merely one of composition or\nconjunction or continuity, but rather of order, in two\ndimensions: (i) of the parts (members) as coordinating with each\nother, and (ii) of the group and its members to its organizing purpose\nor end (finis). Of these, (ii) is the more explanatory, as\nAquinas argues at the very beginning of his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics.\n",
