    "main_text": "The Philosophical Importance of Moral Reasoning || Empirical Challenges to Moral Reasoning\n1.2 Empirical Challenges to Moral Reasoning\n\nOur thinking, including our moral thinking, is often not explicit. We\ncould say that we also reason tacitly, thinking in much the same way\nas during explicit reasoning, but without any explicit attempt to\nreach well-supported answers. In some situations, even moral ones, we\nmight be ill-advised to attempt to answer our practical questions by\nexplicit reasoning. In others, it might even be a mistake to reason\ntacitly \u2013 because, say, we face a pressing emergency. \u201cSometimes\nwe should not deliberate about what to do, and just drive\u201d (Arpaly and\nSchroeder 2014, 50). Yet even if we are not called upon to think\nthrough our options in all situations, and even if sometimes it would\nbe positively better if we did not, still, if we are called upon to do\nso, then we should conduct our thinking responsibly: we should\nreason.\n\nRecent work in empirical ethics has indicated that even when we are\ncalled upon to reason morally, we often do so badly. When asked to\ngive reasons for our moral intuitions, we are often\n\u201cdumbfounded,\u201d finding nothing to say in their defense\n(Haidt 2001). Our thinking about hypothetical moral scenarios has been\nshown to be highly sensitive to arbitrary variations, such as in the\norder of presentation. Even professional philosophers have been found\nto be prone to such lapses of clear thinking (e.g., Schwitzgebel &\nCushman 2012). Some of our dumbfounding and confusion has been laid at\nthe feet of our having both a fast, more emotional way of processing\nmoral stimuli and a slow, more cognitive way (e.g., Greene 2014). An\nalternative explanation of moral dumbfounding looks to social norms of\nmoral reasoning (Sneddon 2007). And a more optimistic reaction to our\nconfusion sees our established patterns of \u201cmoral consistency\nreasoning\u201d as being well-suited to cope with the clashing input\ngenerated by our fast and slow systems (Campbell & Kumar 2012) or\nas constituting \u201ca flexible learning system that generates and updates\na multidimensional evaluative landscape to guide decision and action\u201d\n(Railton, 2014, 813). \n\nEventually, such empirical work on our moral reasoning may yield\nrevisions in our norms of moral reasoning. This has not yet happened.\nThis article is principally concerned with philosophical issues posed\nby our current norms of moral reasoning. For example, given those\nnorms and assuming that they are more or less followed, how do moral\nconsiderations enter into moral reasoning, get sorted out by it when\nthey clash, and lead to action? And what do those norms indicate about\nwhat we ought to do do?\n",
