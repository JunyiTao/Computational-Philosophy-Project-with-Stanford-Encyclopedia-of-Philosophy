Phenomenology, Ethics and Information Technology: The Case of Virtuality\n\nAs indicated above, it would be misleading to suggest that there is a\nvast literature on the phenomenological approach to the social and\nethical implications of information technology. Clearly, the work of\nStiegler, Heidegger, Dreyfus, Borgmann and Ihde discussed above could\nbe described as critical work that aims to open up a horizon for\nsocial and ethical reflection. Nevertheless, there seems to be at\nleast one information technology theme that has attracted some\nsustained attention from phenomenologists (especially with regard to\nits ethical implications)\u2014the phenomenon of virtualization or\nvirtuality. The term \u2018virtuality\u2019 is used here to refer to\nthe mediation of interaction through an electronic medium between\nhumans as well as between humans and machines. The Internet (or\nCyberspace as it is known in cultural discourse) is the most evident\nexample of the virtualization of interaction.\n\nThe development of the Internet and the subsequent extension of\ncomputer networks into all domains of everyday life have prompted much\nspeculation about the way in which this information technology will\nchange human existence, especially our notion of sociality and\ncommunity. Much of this speculation suggests that the virtualization\nof human interaction has led to a multitude of new possibilities for\nhumans\u2014such as cyber communities, virtual education, virtual\nfriendships, virtual organizations, virtual politics, and so forth.\nClearly, such claims about the transformation of the social domain\nhave important implications for our understanding of ethics. One might\nsuggest that most of our current thinking about ethics implies a\ncertain sense of community based on reciprocal moral obligations that\nare largely secured through situated, embodied practices and\ninstitutions that are often overlapping and mutually inclusive. If\nthese practices and institutions become virtualized then it would seem\nthat we need to reconsider some of our most fundamental human\ncategories.\n\nThe proponents of the virtualization of society (and its institutions)\nargue that virtuality extends the social in unprecedented ways\n(Fernback 1997, Rheingold 1993a, 1993b, Turkle 1995, 1996, Benedikt\n1991, Horn 1998). They argue that it opens up an entirely new domain\nof social being. For example Rheingold (1993a) argues that it offers\n\u201ctools for facilitating all the various ways people have\ndiscovered to divide and communicate, group and subgroup and regroup,\ninclude and exclude, select and elect. When a group of people remain\nin communication with one another for extended periods of time, the\nquestion of whether it is a community arises. Virtual communities\nmight be real communities, they might be pseudocommunities, or they\nmight be something entirely new in the realm of social\ncontracts.\u201d (p. 62). According to the proponents this new social\nspace is novel in that it offers completely new ways to be and relate.\nThey argue that through the plasticity of the medium it is possible to\nconceive, construct and present our identities in almost boundless\nways. Turkle (1996) suggests that cyberspace \u201cmake possible the\nconstruction of an identity that is so fluid and multiple that it\nstrains the very limits of the notion [of authenticity]. People become\nmasters of self-presentation and self-creation. There is an\nunparalleled opportunity to play with one\u2019s identity and to\n\u2018try out\u2019 new ones. The very notion of an inner,\n\u2018true self\u2019 is called into question\u2026 the obese can\nbe slender, the beautiful can be plain. The \u2018nerdy\u2019 can be\nelegant. The anonymity of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), such as Second\nlife, (you are known only by the name you gave your characters)\nprovides ample room for individuals to express unexplored\n\u2018aspects of the self\u2019\u201d (p. 158). The claims by\nRheingold, Turkle and others are certainly bold. If they are right\nthen virtuality may indeed represent entirely new possibilities for\nhumans to relate, extend, and express themselves, which should be\nencouraged, especially for those that have become excluded from the\ntraditional domains of social relations, due to disability for\nexample.\n\nThose who treat the internet as an artifact may suggest that we look\nat the impact of mediation (or virtualization) on communication and\nrelations of power; for example, the fact that certain social\nprejudices are circumvented because the individual responding to my\nonline application for a particular service is not confronted with my\nphysical appearance. They may also suggest, as Turkle (1995, 1996) has\ndone, that we look at the way virtualization makes the presentation of\nself and identity more plastic and encourage us to think through the\nconsequences of this for ongoing social interaction. The social\nconstructivists may suggest that we need to look at the assumptions as\nvalues embedded in the artifacts as such (as was suggested above).\nThey may, for example, suggest that we consider the implicit\nassumptions about the nature of communication when considering e-mail\napplications\u2014 for instance, the fact that most e-mail\napplications assume and emulate the structure of a physical letter.\nThey would argue that we need to trace through how people interpret\nthis \u2018letter\u2019 structure to communicate and share objects\n(such as files and pictures) with others, as well as the sorts of\ncommunication such a structure excludes.\n\nPhenomenologists would suggest that these responses are all important\nbut they assume something more primary\u2014i.e., the conditions that\nrender such acts as the presentation of the self, ongoing\ncommunication and sharing meaningful and significant in the first\ninstance. They might suggest that these social acts are all grounded\nin an already presumed sense of community. They might further argue\nthat social interaction, community and identity (as we know it) are\nphenomena that are local, situated and embodied, which is\ncharacterized by mutual involvement, concern and commitment (Dreyfus\n2001; Borgmann 1999, Ihde 2002, Introna 1997, Coyne 1995, Heim 1993).\nIn other words these phenomena draw on an implied sense of\ninvolvement, place, situation, and body for its ongoing meaning. For\nexample, Borgmann (1999) argues that the \u201cunparalleled\nopportunity\u201d of virtuality suggested by Turkle comes at a\n\u2018cost.\u2019 To secure \u201cthe charm of virtual reality at\nits most glamorous, the veil of virtual ambiguity must be dense and\nthick. Inevitably, however, such an enclosure excludes the commanding\npresence of reality. Hence the price of sustaining virtual ambiguity\nis triviality\u201d (p. 189). Indeed such \u2018fluid and\nmultiple\u2019 identity is only feasible as long as it is \u201ckept\nbarren of real consequences\u201d. Dreyfus (1999, 2001) argues, in a\nsimilar vein that without a situated and embodied engagement there can\nbe no commitment and no risk. They argue that in such an environment\nmoral engagement is limited and human relations become trivialized.\nIhde (2002) does not go as far as Borgmann and Dreyfus in discounting\nthe virtual as \u2018trivial.\u2019 Nevertheless, he does claim that\n\u201cVR bodies are thin and never attain the thickness of flesh. The\nfantasy that says we can simultaneously have the powers and\ncapabilities of the technologizing medium without its ambiguous\nlimitations is a fantasy of desire\u201d (p.15).\n\nCoyne (1995), drawing on the work of Heidegger, argues that the\nproximity of community has nothing to do with physical distance. He\nargues that proximity is rather a matter of shared\nconcerns\u2014i.e., my family is \u2018close\u2019 to me even if\nthey are a thousand miles away and my neighbors may be\n\u2018distant\u2019 to me even if they are next door. Levinas (1991,\n1996) takes this claim even further. He suggests that proximity has\nnothing to do with either social or geographic distance. For him\nproximity is an ethical urgency that unsettles our egocentric\nexistence. Proximity is the face\u2014or our always already\nfacing\u2014of the Other (all other human beings) that unsettles the\nongoing attempts by the ego to \u2018domesticate\u2019 the\ninfinitely singular Other (a proper name) into familiar categories\n(race, ethnicity, gender, etc). For the phenomenologist any electronic\ncommunication (or any other communication) will find its meaning in a\nprior horizon of proximity. If we do not already share certain\nconcerns then electronic mediation will not create proximity\neven if it does seem to break down the geographic distances between\nus\u2014even if it is \u2018shrinking\u2019 the world as it were.\nThese authors suggest that our sense of community and the moral\nreciprocity it implies comes from a sustained and situated engagement\nwhere mutual commitments and obligations are secured in the proximity\nof an already shared horizon of ongoing meaning. In a similar vain\nSilverstone (2002, 2003) argues, drawing on the work of Levinas, for\nthe importance of maintaining a \u2018proper distance\u2019 in which\nproximity and responsibility are maintained. He argues that in the\nmodern world of the Internet and increased mobility the stranger\nbecomes \u2018my neighbour\u2019: \u2018and we are all neighbours\nto one another now\u2019. In the mediated world we become inundated\nwith the solicitations of the multitude of others that increasingly\nappear on our screens. How ought we to respond? We cannot allow the\nworld, reconstituted through the new media, to turn into mere images,\npixels on the screen. We must recognize: \u2018that I have as much\nresponsibility for the stranger, that other who is either, physically\nor metaphysically, far from me, as I do for my neighbour\u2019\n(Silverstone 2003: 480). Thus, according to Silverstone the ambiguity\nof a world of \u2018closeness\u2019 and simultaneous\n\u2018distance\u2019 of the other that the new media constitute is\nan altogether different way of being with others that requires a new\nethic of \u2018proper distance\u2019 where the possibility of facing\nthe other, as Other, is not lost in the ethereality of our clicks. It\nis clear from these examples that the ethical question for\nphenomenology is mostly also an ontological question\u2014that is,\nwhat sort of world or way of being are we becoming, as opposed to the\nsort of world we value and want? The phenomenologists would argue that\nthese fundamental choices may only become visible if we approach new\nmedia and ICT (and the ethics they imply) from a phenomenological\npoint of view.\n\nNot all agree with this phenomenological analysis that seems to\nprivilege the face-to-face. Feenberg (1999, and 2004 in Other Internet\nResources), although he is not a phenomenologist as such, nevertheless\nuses phenomenological insights to argue that the messages exchanged\nare not \u2018thin\u2019 but can also be \u2018thick.\u2019 The\nmessages exchanged through e-mail for example are also situated and\nalready imply a certain minimal level of reciprocity and\ncommitment\u2014the mere fact of their exchange implies such a\nminimal horizon of meaning for the act of exchange itself to make\nsense. He argues: \u201cthe interpreted message stands in for the\nworld, is in effect a world. In the case of mediated communication, a\nperson and the social context of their presence are delivered in the\nmessage\u201d (emphasis added). He argues that community is an\nintersubjectively constructed phenomenon that emerges from a mutual\nconnection that may imply a physical co-presence but is not restricted\nto it. He acknowledges that a mediated community may be different and\nhave its own particular problems. Nevertheless, he insists that\n\u201ccommunity needs to be interpreted from the inside out, not as a\ngeographical fact.\u201d In a similar manner Powers (2004) argues,\nwith reference to the well known LambdaMOO \u2018virtual rape\u2019\ncase, that virtuality can lead to real moral wrongs, even if these\nvirtual worlds seem trivial and \u2018shallow\u2019. Introna and\nBrigham (2007) also argue that virtuality affords an opportunity to\nreconsider the meaning of the traditionally assumed community in a\nrather fundamental way. They suggest that the idea of virtual\ncommunities as being \u2018thin\u2019 and\n\u2018shallow\u2019\u2014lacking the depth that local proximity in\nface-to-face communities brings\u2014privileges a certain view of\ncommunity premised upon shared values, or shared concerns, embedded in\nlocal situated face-to-face interaction and practices. They argue that\nin such communities ethics is often rooted in a notion of reciprocity\n(which my not be altruistic at all, may even be economic). In\ncontrast, they suggest, the virtual stranger (popping up on my screen\nas if out of nowhere) radically disturbs such an idea of reciprocity\n(and community). In responding to the virtual stranger the often\npresumed source of our ethics becomes visible. In the anonymity of the\ninterface I have to really decide (become truly responsible)\nbecause the stranger can be easily ignored. \n\nThe phenomenological analysis and critique of virtuality is important\nbecause it forces us to reconsider some of our most fundamental human\ncategories\u2014especially our moral categories. From these debates,\nindicated above, it is apparent that a simple dichotomy that poses the\nvirtual as \u2018thin and trivial\u2019 and situated embodied\nco-presence (often referred to as the \u2018real\u2019) as\n\u2018thick and significant\u2019 is too simple to be helpful. From\nthe phenomenological analysis presented it follows that one of the\nmost important aspects of community is the presumed density of its\nmutually referring concerns and involvements (irrespective of\nmediation). Traditional communities often develop this dense\nreferentiality, quite implicitly, by sharing involvement (and\ntherefore concern) in many overlapping practices and institutions. It\nis conceivable that there are individuals that already share certain\ninvolvements and concerns (such as individuals that share a\ndebilitating disease) that could become an online virtual community\nbecause they are in a very real sense already a community. It seems\nalso evident that individuals who share limited involvements and\nconcerns (such as playing games in MUDs) are unlikely to become a\ncommunity simply because they share a virtual space. Without a dense\nhorizon of mutual involvement and concern upon which we can base\nourselves all choices and actions become equally significant or\ninsignificant\u2014i.e., trivial. Taylor (1991) in discussing the\nethics of authenticity provides a good summary of the importance of\nthis communal horizon of significance for the construction of a\n\u2018thick\u2019 self and therefore a \u2018thick\u2019\ncommunity: \u201cThe agent seeking significance in life, trying to\ndefine him- or herself meaningfully, has to exist in a horizon of\nimportant questions [shared concerns]. That is what is self-defeating\nin modes of contemporary culture that concentrate on self-fulfillment\nin opposition to the demands of society, or nature, which shut out\nhistory and the bonds of solidarity. These self-centred\n\u2018narcissistic\u2019 forms are indeed shallow and\ntrivialised\u201d (p. 40). \n",
