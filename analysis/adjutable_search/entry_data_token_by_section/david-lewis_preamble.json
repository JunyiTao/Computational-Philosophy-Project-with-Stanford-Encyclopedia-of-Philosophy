    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Lewis (1941\u20132001) was one of the most important\nphilosophers of the 20th Century. He made significant contributions to\nphilosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of\nscience, decision theory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In\nmost of these fields he is essential reading; in many of them he is\namong the most important figures of recent decades. And this list\nleaves out his two most significant contributions.\n\nIn philosophy of mind, Lewis developed and defended at length a new\nversion of materialism (see the entry on\n physicalism).\n He started by showing how the motivations driving the identity theory\nof mind and\n functionalism\n could be reconciled in his theory of mind. He called this an identity\ntheory, though his theory motivated the position now known as\n analytic functionalism.\n And he developed detailed accounts of mental content (building on\nDavidson\u2019s\n interpretationism)\n and phenomenal knowledge (building on Nemirow\u2019s\n ability hypothesis)\n that are consistent with his materialism. The synthesis Lewis ended\nup with is one of the central positions in contemporary debates in\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nBut his largest contributions were in metaphysics. One branch of his\nmetaphysics was his Hume-inspired reductionism about the nomological.\nHe developed a position he called \u201cHumean supervenience\u201d,\nthe theory that said that there was nothing to reality except the\nspatio-temporal distribution of local natural properties. And he did\nthis by showing in detail how\n laws, chances,\n counterfactual dependence,\n causation,\n dispositions and colours could be located within this Humean mosaic.\nThe other branch of his metaphysics was his\n modal realism.\n Lewis held that the best theory of modality posited concrete possible\nworlds. A proposition is possible if and only if it is true at one of\nthese worlds. Lewis defended this view in his most significant book,\nOn the Plurality of Worlds. Alongside this, Lewis developed a\nnew account of how to think about modal properties of individuals,\nnamely\n counterpart theory,\n and showed how this theory resolved several long-standing puzzles\nabout modal properties.\n",
