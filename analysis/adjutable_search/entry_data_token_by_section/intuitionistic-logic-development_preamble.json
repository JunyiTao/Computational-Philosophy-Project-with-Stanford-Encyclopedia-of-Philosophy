Brouwer\u2019s\nintuitionistic mathematics. A widespread misconception has it that\nintuitionistic logic is the logic underlying Brouwer\u2019s\nintuitionism; instead, the intuitionism underlies the logic, which is\nconstrued as an application of intuitionistic mathematics to language.\nIntuitionistic mathematics consists in the act of effecting mental\nconstructions of a certain kind. These are themselves not linguistic\nin nature, but when acts of construction and their results are\ndescribed in a language, the descriptions may come to exhibit\nlinguistic patterns. Intuitionistic logic is the mathematical study of\nthese patterns, and in particular of those that characterize valid\ninferences. An inference rule is valid if, whenever the statements in\nthe premises describe truths of intuitionistic mathematics, a\nconstruction can be found that makes true the statement that is\nobtained by applying the rule. What the principles of logic need to\npreserve is therefore not, as in classical logic, mind-independent\ntruth, but mental constructibility. Various principles of classical\nlogic, most notably the Principle of the Excluded Middle, then become\ninsufficiently grounded, and certain classical theorems even\ncontradictory. The theorems in intuitionistic logic that formally\ncontradict classical theorems depend on elements of intuitionistic\nmathematics that are incompatible with classical mathematics; this\nillustrates how in intuitionism logic is based on mathematics and not\nthe other way around.\n\nThe systematic explanation and formalization of intuitionistic logic\nwas begun by Brouwer\u2019s student Arend Heyting in 1928. An\n\u201cexplanation\u201d here is an account of what one knows when\none understands and correctly uses the logical connectives. Since the\n1970s Heyting\u2019s explanation and its variants are known as\n\u201cthe Proof Interpretation\u201d, as the role played by\nmind-independent truth in explanations of classical logic is here\nplayed by proof. For Heyting, a proof was primarily a mathematical\nconstruction in Brouwer\u2019s sense, and, secondarily, a linguistic\ndescription of it. But it turned out that a Proof Interpretation can\nalso be based on other notions of proof. The Proof Interpretation\nunderstood in a more general sense has found many applications outside\nits historical origin, notably in other constructive but\nnon-intuitionistic forms of mathematics, philosophy, computer science,\nand linguistics. This widening of the range of application was\npossible because the original Proof Interpretation depends mostly on\nthe fact that the intuitionistic notion of mathematical truth is of a\nverificationist nature, so that broadly verificationist theories in\nother domains allow for an analogous explanation of their logic.\n\nIn this article, the principal concern is with the development of the\nProof Interpretation within its original context of intuitionistic\nmathematics. Section 1 comments on terminology. Section 2 examines the\nbasis of Brouwer\u2019s conception of logic in his early writings.\nSection 3 presents his later refinements and also his views on\nHilbert\u2019s Program, G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems,\nand the debate in the foundations of mathematics in the 1920s. Section\n4 discusses formalizations of intuitionistic logic, which had begun\neven before the Proof Interpretation had been made explicit, and\nbriefly looks at mathematical interpretations of the formalisms\nobtained. The explanation of the Proof Interpretation in\nHeyting\u2019s writings from 1930 to 1956 is treated in section 5.\nThe sensitivity of intuitionistic logic to the exact conception of\nmathematical construction was at the root of strong objections to\nparts of the Proof Interpretation that arose from within intuitionism.\nThese are discussed in section 6. At the end, a short list is given of\ntopics that will be added in future updates.\n",
