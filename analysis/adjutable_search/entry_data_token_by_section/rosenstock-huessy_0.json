    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nAs with Franz Rosenzweig (who goes to great length in The Star of\nRedemption and Understanding the Sick and the Healthy to\ndemonstrate that God, man and world underpin three fundamentally\ndifferent and irreducible foundations of explanation which have shaped\nour history), Rosenstock-Huessy was convinced that humanism\u2019s attempt\nto free itself from all gods (making humanity and/or nature the ground\nof reality) was based upon a failure to grasp more ancient insights\ninto the nature of the real and the relationship between reality,\nlanguage and history. To this important extent, again like Rosenzweig,\nhe argued that language was more fundamental than either philosophy or\nreligion and philosophy\u2019s attempt to free itself from and reduce\nreligion to a deficient kind of philosophy was based upon its failure\nto take language, and hence reality, sufficiently seriously. As he\nwould say in a letter to Cynthia Harris: \u2018Not religion but\nlanguage forces man to distinguish between this world and the real\nworld, the world as we know it and the genuine, or better known world.\nThe crux of theology is a crux of language, and all our rationalists\nare not protesting against religion but against speech\u2019 (1943,\n162).\n\nBut unlike Karl Barth or Paul Tillich, for example, who saw themselves\nas fusing philosophy and theology, Rosenstock-Huessy refused to see\nhimself primarily as a philosopher or theologian\u2014though when the\nterm philosopher was qualified by the preceding \u2018social\u2019,\nhe was more willing to accept that\n designation.[2]\n His criticisms of theology and philosophy were numerous, varied in\ncontent and highly nuanced\u2014and hence unable to receive full\ntreatment here. Generally, though, he thought both were, what he\ncalled, \u2018second order activities\u2019, or products of the\nreflective mind at \u2018play\u2019. Philosophical and theological\nspeech trailed behind and were dependent upon the more urgent and\ncreative acts of \u2018founding\u2019, that is, those acts which\nemerge out of life\u2019s exigencies, which are epoch making\n\u2018events\u2019 and which are at the source of human institutions\nand new forms of life, and which cannot be separated from the\nvocabulary, or, more specifically, the shared names and foci of\norientation which connect us across space and over\n time.[3]\n In the most philosophical of all his works, the first volume of his\nSoziologie, when contrasting the respective limits of\ntheology with philosophy, he says that theology is guilty of reducing\nus to sinners and angels and thus not adequately accounting for our\nbeing flesh and blood, while philosophers tend to reduce us to objects\nand things in the dead space of the universe and \u2018to mirror the\nobjective world in their subjective world\u2019 (1956, 286).\n\u2018Religion,\u2019 he says in that same section, \u2018is unjust\nagainst nature and the human spirit (Geist)\u2019; while\nphilosophy is blind to \u2018the time-endowing forces\u2019\n(\u2018die zeitstiftenden\n Gewalten\u2019).[4]\n\n\nAgainst philosophers and theologians, he saw his task as restoring our\nattunement to the potencies embedded in our speech and institutions so\nthat we could draw upon the power of past times in order to strengthen\nour openness to the promise of the future in the present. To this end,\nwhile his corpus cuts across numerous disciplines, his major\nsystematic work, one rewritten throughout the course of his life, was\nhis two part Sociology  Im Kreuz der Wirchlichkeit (In the\nCross of Reality)\u2014the first volume of which is to appear with\nTransaction in 2017: volume one originally appeared (to use the\nEnglish title) in 1925 as The Forces of Community, and then\nreworked as  The Hegemony of Spaces; volume two being The\nFull Count of the Times. His social philosophy is concerned with\nhow, when a world implodes on or devours them\u2014through what he\nterms the four social diseases of anarchy, decadence, revolution and\nwar (1970a, 11\u201316)\u2014people can escape the tyranny of forces\nthat have come to rule the space in which they dwell by founding a new\ntime which will then open up other spatial possibilities. For him,\nthen, the key to human freedom is the capacity both to found the new\nand draw upon the powers encapsulated in bodies of time past which\nenable us to live in a present in which we feel blessed by the future.\nRosenstock-Huessy repeatedly argues that philosophy generally is\nparticularly weak in assisting us with this task and it is ultimately\nto sociology that Rosenstock-Huessy turned as \u2018the way to win\nagain our freedom over spaces and through times\u2019 (2009,1, 22).\nHence against the Cartesian cogito, which he saw as providing the\nunderpinning formulation of the philosophy of modernity,\nRosenstock-Huessy retorts with the much more archaic Respondeo\netsi mutabor\u2014\u2018I respond although I will be\nchanged\u2019 (1938, 817\u2013830; 1970b, 17\u201333). In other\nwords, we are fundamentally responsive creatures\u2014and our\ncreations are shaped by our responses either to the weight and push of\nthe past, the burdens or joys of the present or the pull and call of\nthe future. Like Vico, whom Rosenstock-Huessy greatly admired, he\nbelieves we are inescapably rooted in history, even though our great\nrevolutions attempt to rip us out of it, in order to begin anew and\nbuild a much better world, thereby opening up new paths of\n self-hood.[5]\n\n\nPhilosophy\u2019s major deficiency, for Rosenstock-Huessy, is that it is\nnot sufficiently sensitive to time, speech or history. To a large\nextent this is because logic itself is timeless. As he says in\n\u2018The Terms of the Creed\u2019, \u2018logic is that mode of\nspiritual life in which the divinity of timing is omitted\u2019.\nLogic transports us out of time and offers the mind a stable, but\nunreal space. For Rosenstock-Huessy, this search for a stable space is\nreflected in recurrent philosophical elements which privilege the\nimplacability of space (or a particular space) over the ceaselessness\nof time. Modern philosophy\u2019s division of things into subject and\nobject (a spatial configuration) is a case in point, but it goes back\nto the ancients whose building blocks such as topics (from\ntopos place), \u2018categories\u2019 (from kata =\n\u2018down to\u2019 and agora = \u2018the public\nassembly\u2019 i.e. declaiming in the assembly), reason\u2019s\nsphericality, and ideas (the very term idea, eidein =\n\u2018to see\u2019, referring to something visible to the mind\u2019s\neye) all suggest a commitment to (the mental) space\u2019s primacy. The\nsame point is made somewhat more elaborately in the first volume of\nthe In the Cross of Reality (2009, 1,307 \u2013311) where he\nargues that dialectical thought is triadic, but anything that really\nhappens and makes itself manifest, i.e. appears (erscheint),\nis at least\n quadrilateral.[6]\n It must be something in space and time, and hence conform to the\ninner/outerness or subjective/objective matrix of space, as well as\nthe trajective and prejective-ness of time. He called this four-fold\nmatrix the cross of reality and it is applied repeatedly throughout\nhis works.\n\nWhile Rosenstock-Huessy provided a range of arguments against\nphilosophers wanting to make more of reason and less of language, time\nand history than their due, and while he preferred to classify himself\nas a sociologist, he can also be seen as a social philosopher who\nargued for the philosophical necessity of the fusion of history,\nlinguistics, anthropology, sociology, and religion. Franz Rosenzweig\ncertainly saw Rosenstock-Huessy in this light, and he once said to\nhim: \u2018You have never\u2026been to me anything other than a\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d\u2019(1969,\n 82).[7]\n In this respect he belongs to that long line of critics of philosophy\nthat range from ancients to moderns and comic poets to religious\nthinkers\u2014from Aristophanes to Lucian, to Rabelais, from Tatian,\nto Tertullian to Luther, and Pascal to Marx and Nietzsche. All these\ncritics have provided criticisms of philosophy that have ended up, in\ndifferent ways, and at different times, transforming the direction and\ncontent of philosophy.\n",
