    "main_text": "Rights and Reasons || Rights as Trumps\n5.1 Rights as Trumps\n\nThough there are disputes over the function of rights and the history\nof rights language, most agree that rights have special normative\nforce. The reasons that rights provide are particularly powerful or\nweighty reasons, which override reasons of other sorts.\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor is of rights as \u201ctrumps\u201d (Dworkin\n1984). Rights permit their holders to act in certain ways, or give\nreasons to treat their holders in certain ways or permit their holders\nto act in certain ways, even if some social aim would be served by\ndoing otherwise. As Mill wrote of the trumping power of the right to\nfree expression: \u201cIf all mankind minus one were of one opinion,\nmankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than\nhe, if he had the power, would be in silencing mankind\u201d (Mill\n1859, 20).\n\nHow rights become imbued with this special normative force is a matter\nof ongoing scholarly inquiry. As Sreenivasan (2010) notes, a\nHohfeldian claim-right in itself only entails the existence of a duty\nwith a certain structure, and not a duty with a certain force.\nA has a claim against B if and only if B has a duty\nto A: in this definition it is the \u201cdirection\u201d of\nB\u2019s duty (that it is owed to A) which\ncorrelates B\u2019s duty to A\u2019s right;\nnothing is said in the definition about the duty\u2019s strength. Why\n\u201cdirected duties\u201d\u2014as above, those owed to an\nentity\u2014have greater normative priority remains an open question:\nthe only broad consensus is that they do. (See Thompson 2004 on\n\u201cbipolar\u201d judgments.)\n\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor suggests that rights trump non-right\nobjectives, such as increasing national wealth. What of the priority\nof one right with respect to another? We can keep to the trumps\nmetaphor while recognizing that some rights have a higher priority\nthan others. Within the trump suit, a jack still beats a seven or a\nthree. Your right of way at a flashing yellow light has priority over\nthe right of way of the driver facing a flashing red; and the right of\nway of an ambulance with sirens on trumps you both.\n\nThis metaphor of trumps leads naturally to the question of whether\nthere is any right that has priority to absolutely all other normative\nconsiderations: whether there is an \u201cace of rights.\u201d\nGewirth (1981) asserts that there is at least one such absolute right:\nthe right of all persons not to be made the victim of a homicidal\nproject. For such a right to be absolute, it would have to trump every\nother consideration whatsoever: other rights, economic efficiency,\nsaving lives, everything. Not all would agree with Gewirth that even\nthis very powerful right overrides every conceivable normative\nconcern. Some would think it might be justifiable to infringe even\nthis right were this somehow necessary, for example, to prevent the\ndeaths of a great many people. If it is permissible to kill one in\norder to save a billion, then not even Gewirth\u2019s right is\nabsolute.\n",
