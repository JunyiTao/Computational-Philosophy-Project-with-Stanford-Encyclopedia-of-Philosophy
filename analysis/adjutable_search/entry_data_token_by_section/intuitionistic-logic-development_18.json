    "main_text": "The Proof Interpretation Made Explicit || Heyting 1930, 1931\n5.1 Heyting 1930, 1931\n\nHeyting told van Dalen that he had the notion of (intuitionistic)\nconstruction in mind to guide him in devising his formalization of\nintuitionistic logic and mathematics in 1927. In the published version\nof his formalization, he did not elaborate much on the meaning of the\nconnectives; all he explained there about the general meaning of \\(a\n\\rightarrow b\\) was that \u201cIf \\(a\\) is correct,\nthen \\(b\\) is correct too\u201d (Heyting 1930: 44\n[Mancosu 1998: 313]). Correspondence between Heyting and Freudenthal\nin 1930 shows that Heyting up till then did not have a more refined\nexplanation at hand; we will come back to this later in this\nsection.\n\nHeyting began to expound on the meaning of the connectives in print in\ntwo papers written in 1930. The first, Heyting 1930C, was published\nthat same year, the second, the text of his lecture at K\u00f6nigsberg\nin September 1930, was published the next year (Heyting 1931).\n\nThe first paper was a reaction to Barzin and Errera\u2019s claim that\nBrouwer\u2019s logic is three-valued (Barzin & Errera 1927). The\nrelevant points for the explanation of the meaning of the connectives\nin Heyting\u2019s paper are the following. First, an explanation is\ngiven of assertion:\n\n\nHere, then, is the Brouwerian assertion of \\(p\\):\nIt is known how to prove p. We will denote\nthis by \\(\\vdash p\\). The words \u201cto prove\u201d must be taken\nin the sense of \u201cto prove by construction\u201d. [original\nitalics] (Heyting 1930C: 959 [Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nAnd then of intuitionistic negation:\n\n\n\\(\\vdash \\neg p\\) will mean: \u201cIt is known how to reduce \\(p\\)\nto a contradiction\u201d. (Heyting 1930C: 960\n[Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nHeyting goes on to explain that, although on these explanations there\nis a third case beside \\(\\vdash p\\) and \\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), namely the\ncase where one knows neither how to prove \\(p\\) nor how\nto refute it, this does not mean there is a third truth value:\n\n\nThis case could be denoted by \\(p'\\), but it must be realized that\n\\(p'\\) will hardly ever be a definitive statement, since it is\nnecessary to take into account the possibility that the proof of\neither \\(p\\) or \\(\\neg p\\) might one day succeed. If\none does not wish to risk having to retract what one has said, in the\ncase \\(p'\\) one should not state anything at all. (Heyting 1930C: 960\n[Mancosu 1998: 307])\n\n\nThis refutes the contention of Barzin and Errera. Note that these\npoints are all in Brouwer\u2019s writings, too. Indeed, Heyting\n(1932: 121) objects to Barzin and Errera\u2019s term\n\u201cHeyting\u2019s logic\u201d, saying that \u201call the\nfundamental ideas of that logic come from Brouwer\u201d (translation\nmine). But Heyting\u2019s papers will have found a wider audience\nthan Brouwer\u2019s. Brouwer, in turn, was very positive about the\npaper Heyting 1930C, and wrote to the editor of the journal in which\nit appeared (Brouwer to de Donder, October 9, 1930):\n\n\nWhile preparing a note on intuitionism for the Bulletin de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale de\n Belgique,[29]\n I was pleasantly surprised to see the publication of a note by my\nstudent Mr. Heyting, which elucidates in a magisterial manner the\npoints that I wanted to shed light upon myself. I believe that after\nHeyting\u2019s note little remains to be said. (van Dalen 2005:\n676)\n\n\nHeyting also proposes a provability operator +, where \\(+p\\) means\n\u201c\\(p\\) is provable\u201d. The distinction\nbetween \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\) is relevant if one believes\nthat (at least some) propositions are true or false independently of\nour mathematical activity. In that case one can go on and develop a\nprovability logic, as for example G\u00f6del did (see\n Section 1 of the supplementary document\n The Turn to Heyting\u2019s Formalized Logic and Arithmetic.) That is not the intuitionistic conception, and Heyting\nremarks that, if the fulfillment of \\(p\\) requires a\nconstruction, then there is no difference between \\(p\\)\nand \\(+p\\). He adds that, on the intuitionistic explanation of\nnegation, there is indeed no difference between \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(+\\neg\np\\), as a proof of \\(\\neg p\\) is defined as a construction that\nreduces \\(p\\) to a contradiction. But Heyting does not\ngeneralize this remark to all of intuitionistic logic. The final\nsection of the paper is a further discussion of the logic of the\nprovability operator, in particular its interaction with negation\n(e.g., \\(\\vdash \\neg +p\\) is the assertion that \\(p\\)\nis unprovable). But Heyting ends by saying that, as the\nintuitionists\u2019 task is the reconstruction of all mathematics,\nwhile at the same time no examples of propositions have been found so\nfar for which this provability operator would be necessary to express\ntheir status (e.g., to express absolute undecidability), it cannot be\nasked of intuitionists that they develop this logic (Heyting 1930C:\n963 [Mancosu 1998: 309\u2013310])\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg lecture, given in 1930 and published in 1931,\nspecifies the meanings of \\(p, \\neg p\\), and \\(p \\vee q\\). This time\nHeyting makes an explicit connection to phenomenology:\n\n\nWe here distinguish between propositions [Aussagen] and\nassertions [S\u00e4tze]. An assertion is the affirmation of a\nproposition. A mathematical proposition expresses a certain\nexpectation. For example, the proposition, \u201cEuler\u2019s\nconstant \\(C\\) is rational\u201d, expresses the\nexpectation that we could find two integers \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) such that \\(C = a / b\\). Perhaps the word\n\u201cintention\u201d, coined by the phenomenologists, expresses\neven better what is meant here \u2026 The affirmation of a\nproposition means the fulfillment of an intention. (Heyting 1931: 113\n[Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 58\u201359])\n\n\nCompared to the earlier paper written in 1930, the point about the\nprovability operator is amplified:\n\n\nThe distinction between \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\) vanishes as\nsoon a construction is intended in \\(p\\) itself, for\nthe possibility of a construction can be proved only by its actual\nexecution. If we limit ourselves to those propositions which require a\nconstruction, the logical function of provability does not arise at\nall. We can impose this restriction by treating only propositions of\nthe form \u201c\\(p\\) is provable\u201d, or, to put it\nanother way, by regarding every intention as having the intention of a\nconstruction for its fulfillment added to it. It is in this sense that\nintuitionistic logic, insofar as it has been developed up to now\nwithout using the function +, must be understood. (Heyting 1931: 115\n[Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 60; translation modified])\n\n\nThe explanation of disjunction in the K\u00f6nigsberg lecture is:\n\n\n\u201c\\(p \\vee q\\)\u201d signifies that intention which is fulfilled\nif and only if at least one of the intentions \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\) is fulfilled. (Heyting 1931: 114 [Benacerraf\n& Putnam 1983: 59])\n\n\nAnd of negation:\n\n\nBecker, following Husserl, has described its meaning very clearly. For\nhim negation is something thoroughly positive, viz., the intention of\na contradiction contained in the original intention. The proposition\n\u201c\\(C\\) is not rational\u201d, therefore,\nsignifies the expectation that one can derive a contradiction from the\nassumption [Annahme] that \\(C\\) is rational.\nIt is important to note that the negation of a proposition always\nrefers to a proof procedure which leads to the contradiction, even if\nthe original proposition mentions no proof procedure. (Heyting 1931:\n113 [Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 59])\n\n\nHeyting pointed out that these explanations for disjunction and\nnegation, taken together, are an immediate argument against the\nacceptability of PEM, for which a general method would be needed that,\napplied to any given proposition \\(p\\), produces either\na proof of \\(p\\) or a proof of \\(\\neg p\\). What Heyting\ndid not do here was to generalize this explanation of negation to one\nfor implication. Also, note that the procedure does not operate on\nproofs of \\(p\\), but starts from merely the assumption\nthat \\(p\\), which in general gives less information.\nBoth points were taken care of shortly afterward. In a letter to\nFreudenthal dated October 25, 1930, shortly after the K\u00f6nigsberg\nlecture, Heyting wrote:\n\n\nFrom your remarks it has become clear to me that the simple\nexplanation of \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) by \u201cWhen I think \\(a\\),\nI must think \\(b\\)\u201d is\nuntenable; this idea is in any case too indeterminate to be able to\nserve as the foundation for a logic. But also your formulation:\n\u201cWhen \\(a\\) has been proved, so has \\(b\\)\u201d,\nis not wholly satisfactory to me; when I ask\nmyself what you may mean by that, I believe that also \\(a \\rightarrow\nb\\), like the negation, should refer to a proof procedure: \u201cI\npossess a construction that derives from every proof of \\(a\\)\na proof of \\(b\\)\u201d. In the\nfollowing, I will keep to this interpretation. There is therefore no\ndifference between \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) and \\(+a \\rightarrow +b\\).\n(Troelstra 1983: 206\u2013207; translation mine)\n\n\nThis explanation of implication, which is the one that became\nstandard, would be introduced in print only in Heyting 1934: 14; in\nhis paper 1932C, Heyting used the explanation given in Kolmogorov 1932\ninstead (see below).\n\nNeither of these two papers by Heyting contained an argument for the\nvalidity of Ex Falso.\n",
