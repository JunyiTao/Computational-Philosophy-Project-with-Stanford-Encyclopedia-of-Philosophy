Normalization\n\nThe central metatheorem about natural deduction is the\nNormalization theorem, to the effect that proofs in a natural\ndeduction system can be transformed into a \u201cnormal form\u201d,\ninformally characterized by Gentzen as \u201cnot being\nroundabout\u201d. This theorem applies to the full systems for first\norder logic, though in what follows we will, in order to give a\n\u201cflavour\u201d of the result and the method of proving it,\ndescribe only the propositional fragment.\n",
