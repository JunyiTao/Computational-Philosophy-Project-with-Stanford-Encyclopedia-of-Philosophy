    "main_text": "The Concept of Progress || Progress and Goals\n2.4 Progress and Goals\n\nProgress is a goal-relative concept. But even when we\nconsider science as a knowledge-seeking cognitive enterprise, there is\nno reason to assume that the goal of science is one-dimensional. In\ncontrast, as Isaac Levi\u2019s classic Gambling With Truth\n(1967) argued, the cognitive aim of scientific inquiry has to be\ndefined as a weighted combination of several different, and even\nconflicting, epistemic utilities. As we shall see in Section\n3, alternative theories of scientific progress can be understood as\nspecifications of such epistemic utilities. For example, they might\ninclude truth and information (Levi 1967; see also Popper 1959, 1963)\nor explanatory and predictive power (Hempel 1965). Kuhn\u2019s (1977)\nlist of the values of science includes accuracy, consistency, scope,\nsimplicity, and fruitfulness.\n\nA goal may be accessible in the sense that it can be reached\nin a finite number of steps in a finite time. A goal is\nutopian if it cannot be reached or even approached. Thus,\nutopian goals cannot be rationally pursued, since no progress can be\nmade in an attempt to reach them. Walking to the moon is a utopian\ntask in this sense. However, not all inaccessible goals are utopian:\nan unreachable goal, such as being morally perfect, can function as a\nregulative principle in Kant\u2019s sense, if it guides our\nbehavior so that we are able to make progress towards it.\n\nThe classical sceptic argument against science, repeated by Laudan\n(1984a), is that knowing the truth is a utopian task. Kant\u2019s\nanswer to this argument was to regard truth as a regulative principle\nfor science. Charles S. Peirce, the founder of American pragmatism,\nargued that the access to the truth as the ideal limit of scientific\ninquiry is \u201cdestined\u201d or guaranteed in an\n\u201cindefinite\u201d community of investigators. Almeder\u2019s\n(1983) interpretation of Peirce\u2019s view of scientific progress is\nthat there is only a finite number of scientific problems and they\nwill all be solved in a finite time. However, there does not seem to\nbe any reason to think that truth is generally accessible in this\nstrong sense. Therefore, the crucial question is whether it is\npossible to make rational appraisals that we have made progress in the\ndirection of the truth (see Section 3.4).\n\nA goal is effectively recognizable if there are routine or\nmechanical tests for showing that the goal has been reached or\napproached. If the defining criteria of progress are not recognizable\nin this strong sense, we have to distinguish true or real\nprogress from our perceptions or estimations of\nprogress. In other words, claims of the form \u2018The step from\nstage \\(A\\) to stage \\(B\\) is progressive\u2019 have to be\ndistinguished from our appraisals of the form \u2018The step from\nstage \\(A\\) to stage \\(B\\) seems progressive on the available\nevidence\u2019. The latter appraisals, as our own judgments, are\nrecognizable, but the former claims may be correct without our knowing\nit. Characteristics and measures that help us to make such appraisals\nare then indicators of progress.\n\nLaudan requires that a rational goal for science should be accessible\nand effectively recognizable (Laudan 1977, 1984a). This requirement,\nwhich he uses to rule out truth as a goal of science, is very strong.\nThe demands of rationality cannot dictate that a goal has to be given\nup, if there are reasonable indicators of progress towards it. \n\nA goal may be backward-looking or forward-looking:\nit may refer to the starting point or to the destination point of an\nactivity. If my aim is to travel as far from home as possible, my\nsuccess is measured by my distance from Helsinki. If I wish to become\never better and better piano player, my improvement can be assessed\nrelative to my earlier stages, not to any ideal Perfect Pianist. But\nif I want to travel to San Francisco, my progress is a function of my\ndistance from the destination. Only in the special case, where there\nis only one way from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the backward-looking and the\nforward-looking criteria (i.e., distance from \\(A\\) and\ndistance to \\(B)\\) determine each other. \n\nKuhn and Stegm\u00fcller were advocating backward-looking criteria of\nprogress. In arguing against the view that \u201cthe proper measure\nof scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer\nto\u201d the ultimate goal of \u201cone full, objective true account\nof nature,\u201d Kuhn suggested that we should \u201clearn to\nsubstitute evolution-from-what-we-know for\nevolution-toward-what-we-wish-to-know\u201d (Kuhn 1970, p. 171). In\nthe same spirit, Stegm\u00fcller (1976) argued that we should reject\nall variants of \u201ca teleological metaphysics\u201d defining\nprogress in terms of \u201ccoming closer and closer to the\ntruth.\u201d\n\nA compromise between forward-looking and backward-looking criteria can\nbe proposed in the following way. If science is viewed as a\nknowledge-seeking activity, it is natural to define real progress in\nforward-looking terms: the cognitive aim of science is to know\nsomething that is still unknown, and our real progress depends on our\ndistance from this destination. But, as this goal is unknown to us,\nour estimates or perceptions of progress have to be based on\nbackward-looking evidential considerations. This kind of view of the\naims of science does not presuppose the existence of one\nunique ultimate goal. To use Levi\u2019s words, our goals may be\n\u201cmyopic\u201d rather than \u201cmessianic\u201d (Levi 1985):\nthe particular target that we wish to hit in the course of our inquiry\nhas to be redefined \u201clocally,\u201d relative to each cognitive\nproblem situation. Furthermore, in addition to the multiplicity of the\npossible targets, there may be several roads that lead to the same\ndestination. The forward-looking character of the goals of inquiry\ndoes not exclude what Stegm\u00fcller calls \u201cprogress\nbranching.\u201d This is analogous to the simple fact that we may\napproach San Francisco from New York along two different\nways\u2014via Chicago or St Louis. \n",
