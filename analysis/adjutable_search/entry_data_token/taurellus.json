Life and Works\n\nNicolaus Taurellus (Oechslein) was born on November 26, 1547 in\nMontb\u00e9liard/M\u00f6mpelgard into the family of a poor city\nclerk (for biographic information, see Baier 1728: 1\u201314; Bayle\n1730: vol. 4, p. 327; Schmid 1860: 1\u201322). At the time, the city\nwas politically affiliated with the duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, and\npatronage by the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg allowed Taurellus to study\nphilosophy at the University of T\u00fcbingen with the eminent\nAristotelian logician and natural philosopher Jacob Schegk (on the\nintellectual scene in sixteenth-century T\u00fcbingen, see Methuen\n1998; on Schegk, see Kusukawa 1999). After completing his master of arts in philosophy (1565), he began\nto study theology but soon moved on to medicine and completed his\nmedical doctorate at the University of Basel (1570). In 1573, he\npublished his first and most comprehensive work in metaphysics,\nThe Triumph of Philosophy (PT), which pursued the plan to\nprovide a unified account of philosophical and theological truth and\nthereby to offer a philosophical defense of the doctrine of creation\n(PT: 220\u2013222, 250\u2013252; for overviews of Taurellus\u2019s\nmetaphysics, see Petersen 1921: 219\u2013258; Mayer 1959; Leinsle\n1985: 147\u2013165; Wollgast 1988: 148\u2013153). In spite of its\npious intention, and although it appeared with one of Europe\u2019s\nleading academic publishers of the time, the Henricpetri press, the\nwork was perceived as a provocation and, career-wise, initially turned\nout to be a failure.\n\nAfter several difficult years, Taurellus took up a professorship in\nethics at the University of Basel in 1579, and in 1580 he accepted a\nprofessorship in natural philosophy and medicine at the University of\nAltdorf, the university of the city of Nuremberg (on his activity at\nAltdorf, see Mayer 1960). In accordance with his teaching duties, he\npublished a massive volume on medical prognostics (Taurellus 1581) and\nan annotated edition of the works of the thirteenth-century physician\nArnaldus of Villanova (Arnaldus of Villanova 1585). He returned to\nphilosophy in 1586 with a critical commentary (VML) on\nAristotle\u2019s On Life and Death. In 1596 he published a\nshort overview and evaluation of Aristotelian metaphysics, followed in\nthe next year by a 1000-page response to the Averroistic philosophy of\nAndrea Cesalpino (1524/25\u20131603), whose work became influential\nat the University of Altdorf (see Mulsow 2004: 7\u20139). In a group\nof three last monographic works, Cosmology (1603 [KOS]),\nUranology (1603) and On the Eternity of Things (1604\n[DRA]), Taurellus gives detailed responses to central themes of late\nscholastic cosmology, especially as developed by the Paduan\nphilosopher Francesco Piccolomini (1520\u20131604). Also a 1604\ndissertation, On the Origin of Rational Souls (TRA), is\nmarked by its preface and references to earlier metaphysical works as\na text authored by Taurellus (which corresponds to academic practice\nin early modern Germany). Apart from his scholarly publications, he\nproduced two volumes of poetry (Taurellus 1592, 1595), one of which is\nregarded as a significant contribution to early modern emblematics\n(see Homann 1971: 105\u2013122). On September 28, 1606 Taurellus\nsuccumbed to the plague at the age of 58.\n2. Immaterialism and the Compositional Structure of the World\n\nIn his Triumph of Philosophy, Taurellus accepts the\ntraditional claim that the elements (earth, water, air, fire) are the\nbasic constituents of the natural world. However, he develops an\nintricate argument for denying the received view that prime matter\nenters into the constitution of elements (see Blank 2014). Thereby, he\noffers a reinterpretation of the nature of the elements. The argument\nstarts with a consideration of the motivation for introducing the\nnotions of form and prime matter. As he describes it, the motivation\narises out of the view that in natural things there are contrary\nproperties: active properties such as the capacity of bringing forth\nchanges in other things, and passive properties such as the capacity\nof undergoing change through the agency of other things. If these\nproperties are understood as contrary, then they seem to require two\ndifferent origins. For this reason, the active properties of natural\nthings were seen as requiring the existence of forms, while the\npassive properties of natural things were seen as requiring the\nexistence of primary matter (PT: 202).\n\nHowever, Taurellus challenges the assumption that active and passive\nproperties of natural things should be regarded as contraries. This is\nwhy: \u201cNothing takes on its contrary but rather cedes when the\ncontrary comes; but passivity increases with the increase of\nactivity\u201d (PT: 284). Hence, his argument against the contrary\nnature of active and passive properties is that an increase of passive\npower is compatible with an increase of active power. But if activity\nand passivity are not contraries, \u201cthey are present in the same\nsubject and proceed from the same cause\u201d (PT: 292). At the same\ntime, Taurellus holds on to the assumption that the active properties\nof things have to be explained by the existence of an active\nprinciple. This is why he does not eliminate the notion of form from\nhis ontology. On the contrary, because active and passive properties\nare not contraries, he believes that they proceed from forms alone:\n\n\n\nWe say that a thing is active and passive with respect to the same\nform; but in such a way that action is its proper effect, while the\nother does not arise from matter conjoined with it but from an\nexternally existing contrary principle. (PT: 294)\n\n\nRegarding forms as the unique kind of origin of the active and passive\nproperties of natural things also leads to a reinterpretation of the\ncompositional structure of the world. In Taurellus\u2019s view, forms\nare the only beings underlying the compositional structure of the\nworld: \u201cMatter plainly does not exist, and nothing but forms can\nbe and can enter composition\u201d (PT, 280). Accordingly,\n\u201cmixture or composition is \u2026 a mere conjunction of forms\nthat in no way changes them\u201d (PT: 276). At the same time,\nunderstanding composition in this way implies that no substantial form\ncan be understood as a composition of other forms (PT: 274). Rather,\nevery composition is accidental (PT). This is why Taurellus formulates\nthe provocative claim that a human being does not possess substantial\nunity but rather is an aggregate of a plurality of forms (PT:\n110).\n\nTaurellus continues to use the term \u201cmatter\u201d. Obviously,\nhowever, his immaterialism about the basic constituents of the natural\nworld leads to a reinterpretation of the meaning of the term. One of\nthe reinterpretations that he offers derives from his view that\ncomplex natural beings contain a plurality of hierarchically ordered\nsubstantial forms. His reinterpretation of matter in terms of\nsubordinate forms allows Taurellus to continue to talk about bodies\n(corpora) and corporeal beings (entia corporalia)\n(PT: 160\u2013162; 182; 352\u2013354; 552\u2013554). As he puts it,\n\u201cif it is not understood as a less noble form, \u2026 matter\ndoes absolutely not compose anything\u201d (PT: 278). Thus, there is\na sense in which one can talk about matter in which one uses a\ntraditional connotation of the notion of matter, namely, that it is\nsomething less noble that underlies something nobler (PT: 296). Thus,\neven if the idea that prime matter underlies form is given up, the\nstructure of something less noble underlying something nobler can be\nupheld. More specifically, less noble forms can be understood as the\nsubjects of nobler forms. In Taurellus\u2019s view, things receive\nthe character of subjects \n\n\nfor the same reason that makes that they are less noble, such that\nforms that are within nothing else but serve as subjects for something\nelse are the most ignoble, but those that do not serve as subjects for\nanything else but are within something else are nobler. (PT: 330)\n\n\nAs Taurellus explains, a form is nobler than other forms if it is more\nprone to cause changes in other forms, and form is less noble than\nother forms if it is more prone to receive the effect of the\nactivities of other forms. Passive changes of forms thus are seen as a\nresult of the contingent activity of other forms together with the\ninternal constitution of the forms that have undergone change (PT:\n298). In this sense, in Taurellus\u2019s view the subordination\nrelation between substantial forms reduces to relations of efficient\ncausation between substantial forms. Consequently, Taurellus regards\nthe activities of substantial forms as the origin of all of the forces\nfound in the natural world: \n\n\nNature is the unique principle of corporeal things and consists in a\nsingle substance, not in two or three substances. This substance seems\nto be manifold because it expresses itself in various forces. (PT:\n376)\n\n\nThere is still another sense in which the notion of matter retains a\nfunction in Taurellus\u2019s metaphysics. This becomes clear when\nTaurellus suggests a metaphorical usage of the notion of prime matter.\nAs he puts it, with respect to God prime matter is \u201cthe\nNOTHING\u201d (in capital letters) out of which God creates the world\n(PT). The connection that Taurellus establishes between the notion of\nprime matter and the notion of nothing strongly differs from the use\nof the term \u201cnothing\u201d that often designates matter in the\nNeoplatonic tradition (see Bovillus 1510: fol. 63v\u201364r).\nTaurellus denies that prime matter is a constituent of created beings\nand holds that immaterial forms have active and passive\ncharacteristics of their own. His point is not that matter, due to its\nlack of determination, is \u201cclose to\u201d nothing, nor that\nmatter is undetermined except for its three-dimensional\ncharacteristics. Rather, when he calls prime matter\n\u201cnothing\u201d he has in mind a strict identity statement. This\nis why it is a suitable metaphor for what is there before the divine\nact of creation, namely, no created being. Prime matter in this\nmetaphorical sense is absolute non-being.\n3. Substantiality and Ontological Dependence\n\nTaurellus\u2019s immaterialism about the basic constituents of the\nnatural world derives from considerations concerning the\nsubstantiality of created beings. Taurellus maintains that creatures,\nin one sense, are not separated from God and that, in another sense,\nthey are separated from God. As to the first sense, he argues that\n\u201csince an infinite substance fills out everything, nothing can\nbe separated from it\u201d. As to the second sense, we differ\nnumerically from God \u201cnot with a view to God\u2019s being in us\nand our being in him but in the respect that we differ due to our\nsubstance\u201d (PT: 412). Hence, God is characterized as a being\nthat extends throughout the whole of space. And this means that no\ncreature can be spatially separated from God. The only sense in which\ncreatures can be understood to be separated from God thus must have to\ndo with the nature of their substance. And to differ from God with\nrespect to substance presupposes that creatures are substances. This\nis why establishing the sense in which creatures can be understood to\nbe substances is central for Taurellus\u2019s project.\n\nTaurellus considers the alternative hypothesis that natural beings are\nconjoined with their cause in such a way that if their essences would\nnot be sustained by their cause they could not persist. However, he\nobjects that this hypothesis would lead to a kind of substance monism\naccording to which the world would be an accident of the divine\nsubstance: \n\n\nIf the world is not separated by its substance from God but always\nexists conjoined with him and in the same way will persist to\neternity, it does not subsist in itself \u2026 But it will be an\naccident of God that can neither be separated from him nor persist\nseparately. (PT: 428) \n\n\nIn Taurellus\u2019s view, the world cannot be an accident of the\ndivine substance both due to the nature of God and due to the nature\nof natural things. As to the nature of God, Taurellus argues that\nregarding the world as a divine accident has the absurd consequence\nthat one would have to ascribe to God finite accidents: \n\n\nThe absurdity cannot be avoided that an infinite substance will be\ndefined by finite accidents, for the nature of accidents consists in\nlimiting substances or to define them is some other way. (PT: 430)\n\n\n\nIn particular, \n\n\nit would follow \u2026 that we are the perfection of the substance\nof God because actions perfect the substance from which they proceed\n(PT: 492) \n\n\nTaurellus argues that this cannot be right because, due to his\ninfinity, God cannot be said to have accidents at all: \n\n\nBecause God exists infinitely with respect to substance, he does not\nreceive anything through which he could be defined, which is the\nreason why accidents are as foreign to him as possible since they\nlimit or define substances. (PT: 454)\n\n\nTaurellus\u2019s view that forms are the only beings that underlie\nthe compositional structure of the world contributes to explicating a\nsense in which the world differs by its substance from God. Taurellus\npoints out that there is a close connection between his criticism of\nthe theory of prime matter and his theological aim of defending the\ndoctrine of creation. This connection has to do with a consequence\nthat, in his view, follows from the theory of prime matter, namely,\nthat prime matter is an accidental being. As he remarks, the\nAristotelian principles \u201cwant matter which is nothing by itself\nto be something accidentally. For if this is true, it will be an\naccident, not a substance\u201d (PT: 240). As Taurellus argues,\nsomething analogous holds for the conception of form in the\nhylomorphic tradition: \n\n\nThe natural philosophers have stated that natural forms cannot subsist\nwithout a subject; if this were admitted, they would not be substances\nbut accidents, because substances are not in something or from\nsomething but subsist through their own force, while one says of\naccidents that they do not subsist but rather are in something. (PT:\n318)\n\n\nWhat is more, Taurellus does not think that a conception of matter and\nform as accidental beings could be given a consistent formulation. As\nhe argues, a theory of mutual existential dependence between primary\nmatter and form leads to the absurd consequence \n\n\nthat the effect is in this case its own cause. For what gives essence\nto something else is a cause, a form that cannot subsist without\nmatter is its effect; and conversely because matter is absolutely\nnothing without form, its subsistence depends on its own effect. (PT:\n320) \n\n\nA theory of immaterial forms is exactly what yields an analysis of the\nsubstantiality of elements. This is so because, once the assumption\nthat form depends existentially on prime matter is given up, there is\nno need to regard form as an accidental being: \n\n\nTell me, does nature subsist by itself or does it subsist in something\nother? If you say that nothing underlies it, why shouldn\u2019t one\nbe allowed to ascribe the same to form, such that it is nature and\nsubsists without matter? (PT: 376) \n\n\nTaurellus\u2019s immaterialism about the basic constituents of the\ncompositional structure of reality thus explicates a sense in which\nthese basic constituents are substances.\n\nThe ensuing view of the relation between God and creatures accepts\ncreation dependence of creatures on God but denies the dependence of\ncreatures\u2019 continued subsistence on God. Taurellus gives the\nfollowing characterization of physical change: \n\n\nNothing happens accidentally if not something that is in itself is\npresupposed. The natural philosophers propose this as an axiom, that\nsomething active does not have any effect unless the subject on which\nthis action is directed possesses the disposition to receive this\nactivity. (PT: 266\u2013268) \n\n\nThus, in Taurellus\u2019s view natural things possess are active\npotencies that bring forth changes in other natural things and passive\npotencies that make them capable of undergoing changes through the\nagency of other natural things. These natural changes are determined\nby natural active and passive potencies of immaterial forms, but these\nnatural potencies cannot bring about any kind of change for which\nimmaterial forms do not have a disposition.\n\nThis is why these changes do not carry with them any threat to the\nsubsistence of the world: \n\n\nBecause the world is substance and because one says that something is\nchanged naturally when it is changed in a direction for which it has\nsome disposition in it, it follows that if the world does not decay in\nthis way, it does not carry any potency [for decay] in itself. (PT:\n498) \n\n\nIn this sense, the existence of natural things is due to a divine act\nof creation but the subsistence of these natural things does not\nrequire any continuous divine concurrence: \u201cThings \u2026 have\nreceived substance from him, but they do not continue to receive\nit\u201d (PT: 492). This is the crucial point that Taurellus\u2019s\nrejection of prime matter is meant to make. Only if the subsistence of\nthe forms that underlie the compositional structure of the world as\nwell as their active and passive potencies does not depend on\ncontinued divine agency can the hypothesis that the world is an\neternal accident of the divine substance be refuted.\n4. Living Beings and the Origin of Souls\n\nStill, using the notion of form in this way to characterize the\nsubstantiality of the ultimate constituents of reality still leaves\nmuch to be explicated with respect to the origin of living beings.\nTaurellus considers a creation theory of the origin of human souls\n(PT: 144), but he also voices doubt concerning such a theory. In\nparticular, he cautions that an act of divine creation would render\nthe imperfection of human souls inexplicable (PT: 166). Therefore, he\noffers an integrated naturalistic account of the origin of the souls\nof non-human animals and humans.\n\nHere, the connection between Taurellus and his teacher Jacob Schegk\nbecomes relevant. Schegk maintains that both inanimate forms and\nanimate forms depend on the mixture of elements. As he points out,\nsuch a conception of the origin of animate forms has the consequence\nthat \u201can animate form also is a physical form \u2026\u201d\n(PT). In fact, such a view of the origin of souls is found in\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE), upon whose work Schegk has\ncommented extensively. According to Alexander, the soul \n\n\nis a power and form, which supervenes through such a mixture upon the\ntemperament of bodies; and it is not a proportion or a composition of\nthe temperament. (Alexander of Aphrodisias 1568: 78, 2008: 104) \n\n\nAs Victor Caston has argued, talk about supervenience should here be\ntaken in the technical sense of a co-variation of mental states with\nbodily states (Caston 1997: 348\u2013349). Moreover, Caston\nemphasizes that, for Alexander, the soul possesses causal powers that\nare more than the aggregates of the causal powers of the elements\n(1997: 349\u2013350). In the sense that Alexander ascribes distinct\nnew powers to souls as well as to the forms of non-animate composites\nsuch as chemical blends, Caston characterizes Alexander as one of the\nancient thinkers who were committed to emergentism (1997).\n\nTaurellus adopts a similar line of argument. He holds that \n\n\nwhen by mutual action and passion mixed things are changed in such a\nway that none of them remains entirely the same, but some new form\narises out of it that related to the forces of all of them, without\ndoubt there exist mixed forms that have the forces of many, bring\nabout different effects, which is most evident in the changes of\nthings and especially in the use of medicaments. (PT: 272) \n\n\nAlso, he is clear that what arises in genuine mixture is not only a\ncomposition of simple compounds but also a simple form. In his view,\nthis form is simple \u201cbecause it is not composed but rather\ngenerated\u201d (PT: 42). Consequently, it cannot undergo a process\nof being split up, although it can perish when the basis from which it\nemerges is changed (PT). This is why the simplicity and immateriality\nof emergent forms is compatible with their capability of being\ndestroyed (PT: 44; 276). \n\nThis conception of the emergence of new forms is what underlies\nTaurellus\u2019s analysis of the structure of plants and animals. He\nascribes soul and life only to the latter since only they possess\nsense and self-motion (PT: 350), but this should not obscure the\nfundamental analogy between the emergence of forms in plant and the\nemergence of forms in animals. In his view, what possesses life in the\nproper sense are higher kinds of forms\u2014the souls of animals\n(PT). The organic body of an animal, constituted by a plurality of\nless noble substantial forms, possesses life only in a derivative\nsense, since it possesses active and passive properties that derive\nfrom the active and passive properties of the animal soul (PT: 352).\nBut even if he follows the Galenic tradition in denying life to plants\n(VML: sig. B3r), he ascribes to each plant a substantial form that\naccounts for some of the activities of the organic plant\nbody\u2014activity that cannot be explained by the temperament of\nelementary qualities (VML: sig. G3r). Something analogous holds for\nplant seeds and animal seeds: They do not possess a soul but a natural\nform that is capable of generating plants and animals (VML: sig. B5r;\nTRA: 11). As Taurellus argues, it is necessary to postulate the\nexistence of such natural forms because not all kinds of attraction\nrelevant for operation of plants and seeds can be explained by the\nagency of elementary heat (VML: sig. B5v). Thus, even plant forms and\nseed forms possess new causal potencies that go beyond the causal\npotencies of the elements that function as the matter of the emerging\nform.\n\nAs Taurellus characterizes it, there is a circle of causation between\nthe emergent form and the elements from which it emerges: The life of\nthe soul is communicated to the body (VML: sig. Gr), but the life of\nthe souls is also perfected by actions that it can only carry out by\nmeans of the body (VML: sig. Gv). Consequently, the soul perfects the\nbody and the body perfects the soul (VML: sig. G2r). Astonishingly,\nTaurellus applies such a conception of the mutual dependence between\nforms and organic bodies even to the case of humans. As he claims,\n\u201cthe human soul by itself is capable of ceasing to be\u201d\n(VML: sig. F4v). Thus, they have in common with the soul of brutes\nthat \u201cthey necessarily have their essence and life in a\nbody\u201d (VML: sig. G4r; see TRA: 11). Taurellus does not challenge\nthe theological idea of immortality but concludes that if human beings\nare immortal, the relevant supernatural divine agency responsible for\nresurrection must relate to soul and body alike (TRA: 26).\n5. The Problem of Substance Monism Revisited\n\nTaurellus returns to the problem of substance monism in his extended\ncritical response to Cesalpino (see Muratori 2014; Blank 2015:\n194\u2013199). Taurellus makes clear that one of his main targets of\ncriticism is Cesalpino\u2019s conception of God. As Taurellus points\nout, in a crucial respect Cesalpino goes beyond Averroes: \n\n\nWhat [Averroes] said about the assisting intellect, Cesalpino extends\nto the souls of humans and of the other animals, and of the entire\nworld, for he asserts a single soul that exists by itself and is\nmultiplied according to the bodies of living beings. And through\nparticipating in it, the bodies are animated and substances. (AC: 25)\n\n\n\nTaurellus is clear that such a conception implies that God is not\nseparated from matter and also not an efficient cause of things;\nrather, God is understood as a constituent cause (AC: 25\u201326).\nWhat is more, Cesalpino\u2019s conception of God seems to imply\nsubstance monism not only with respect to all animate beings but also\nwith respect to the world as a whole.\n\nSubstance monism seems to be an implication of a combination of views\nheld by Cesalpino: (1) the view that the active intellect is a\nsubstance that is capable of self-reflection; (2) the view that the\nactive intellect \u201cperfects everything\u201d; and (3) the view\nthat the active intellect \u201cimplants into things a striving for\nperfection insofar as it is intellection\u201d (Cesalpino 1593: fol.\n35v). Thus, the substantiality of the active intellect is\ncharacterized as being due to its capability of self-reflection, and\nit is this specific activity that is understood as the origin of the\nactivity of natural things, not only of minds. Consequently, Cesalpino\nmaintains that the plurality of substances cannot be based on\nconsiderations concerning human self-reflection. His argument invokes\nthe possibility of a temporary split in the self-consciousness of the\nactive intellect\u2014the possibility that during the life-time of a\nliving being the part of the active intellect that animates this\nliving being undergoes a stream of acts of self-reflection that are\nisolated from the stream of acts of self-reflection that other parts\nof the active intellect undergo at the same time. If so, individual\nminds would be \u201cincluded in a unique intelligence as parts are\ncontained in a whole or as a smaller number is contained in a larger\nnumber\u201d (Cesalpino 1593: fol. 36r).\n\nOne of the most interesting criticisms that Taurellus levels against\nCesalpino concerns exactly this issue. As Taurellus argues, the claim\nthat reflexive acts are due to parts of the active intellect could be\nconstrued in two ways. The first way would be to understand the\nrelation between the activities of the parts of the active intellect\nand the activities of the active intellect as a whole as analogous to\nthe relation between the activities of the parts of a stone in motion\nand the activity of the whole stone in motion. Here, the activities of\nthe parts of the moving stone are of the same kind as the activities\nof the moving stone as a whole: self-motion with the same direction\nand speed. If this were the relevant analogy, Taurellus argues, the\nactivities of the parts of the active intellect would be of the same\nnature as the activities of the active intellect as a whole (AC:\n270\u2013271). Evidently, this is contrary to the assumption that\nCesalpino makes, namely, that one part of the active intellect does\nnot have reflexive access to the activities of any other part of the\nactive intellect.\n\nBy contrast, the second way of understanding the relation between the\nparts of the active intellect and the active intellect as a whole\nwould be to use the analogy of the relation between the parts of a\nclock and the clock as a whole. Here, we have in fact different kinds\nof activities. But, as Taurellus argues, the difference between the\nactivities of the parts of a clock is exactly what justifies regarding\nthese parts as separate entities of a different kind. Analogously,\nwhat speaks in favor of regarding human minds as separate substances\nis not just the fact that reflexive acts occur but also that the\ncontent of one series of reflexive acts is not accessible from the\nperspective of another series of reflexive acts (AC: 271). The\ncognitive inaccessibility of one series of reflexive acts from the\nperspective of another series of reflexive acts would thus be\ninexplicable when one assumes, as Cesalpino does, that these acts\nderive from a unique intelligence. This is why Taurellus believes that\nthe structure of reflexive acts speaks in favor of the existence of a\nplurality of active substances.\n6. Emanative Causation and the Problem of the Eternity of the World\n\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of a separation between God and creatures\nwith respect to substance is challenged not only by Cesalpino\u2019s\nversion of a theory of a unique intellect but also by theories of\nemanation prominent in early modern Platonism. This is why in\nCosmology (1603 [KOS]) and On the Eternity of Things\n(1604 [DRA]) Taurellus discusses Piccolomini\u2019s views on\nemanative causation (see Blank 2009). Like Taurellus, Piccolomini\nraises numerous objections against thinking about the relation between\nGod and the world in terms of emanative causation. However, Taurellus\ncriticizes Piccolomini on two levels: he thinks that many of\nPiccolomini\u2019s arguments are flawed in matters of detail and,\nhence, do not lend support to the desired conclusion; and he\nreproaches Piccolomini for conceding too much to the\nPlatonists\u2014such as the view that elementary forces derive from\nthe agency of a Platonic world soul. No doubt, Taurellus\u2019s books\nwere highly informative for his contemporaries in that they show how a\ntheory of emanative causation might work. However, understanding the\nrelation between God and the world as an emanation relation turns out\nto be incompatible with his own view of the subsistence independence\nof elements.\n\nIn Taurellus\u2019s view, several arguments provide reasons against\nunderstanding subsistence dependence of created beings in terms of\nformal emanation. Taurellus holds that elements possess forms and\nforces that are independent of any continued divine agency. That he\nascribes formal properties to elements that are independent of a\ncontinuous conserving activity of God becomes clear, where he\ndiscusses Piccolomini\u2019s claim that every part of the world\ndepends on God (Piccolomini 1596b: bk. II, ch. 2). Taurellus points\nout that Piccolomini derives this claim from Marsilio Ficino, who held\nthat corporeal mass cannot exist on its own since otherwise it would\nform itself (see Ficino 2001\u20132006: vol. 1, 18\u201327). As\nFicino and Piccolomini argue, conveying form onto a corporeal\nsubstance is not a property of body since all active beings act by\nmeans of some incorporeal faculty.\n\nFicino and Piccolomini conclude that the world depends in all its\nparts on an incorporeal principle of agency in such a way that, since\nit depends always on this principle, it can be said to be created\ncontinually (DRA: 448\u2013449). Taurellus agrees that bodily mass\ncannot convey form onto itself. However, he does not believe that\nbodily mass, once it is formed, requires any external active\nprinciple to preserve its form (DRA: 449). Likewise, he holds that\nelements have their own forces\u2014forces that are derived from the\nelements, not from any being external to them. In his view, the\nheavens not only do not have the force to convey form to elements,\nthey are also unnecessary to explain the forces that elements possess.\nTaurellus takes issue with Piccolomini\u2019s claim that God imparts\nforces on things in the world by means of a Platonic world soul (see\nPiccolomini 1596a: ch. 30). Contrary to Piccolomini, Taurellus holds\nthat in addition to general forces that influence all bodies on earth\nin a uniform way, there are specific forces that belong to the\nelements (DRA: 275).\n\nTaurellus develops some further considerations against understanding\nsubsistence dependence in terms of the emanation of the essences of\nnatural beings from the essence of God. Suppose that the heavens are\npreserved by means of continuous creation or by means of a perpetual\nefflux of divine essence. In this case, Taurellus argues,\nHeraclitus\u2019 view of the perpetual flux of all things would be\nconfirmed since nothing would remain intact beyond the duration of a\nmoment. If emanation is thought of as a \u201cflow\u201d of essence,\nas much essence as is conveyed to a particular object at a given\nmoment has to be previously withdrawn from its source (KOS:\n235\u2013236). In this way, emanation of essence implies the constant\nchange both of created things and their source. Taurellus argues that\nsuch a conception of the mutability of all created things is contrary\nto the Aristotelian conception of the regular and stable motions of\nthe stars\u2014motions which become inexplicable once one assumes\nthat stars are unstable and momentary objects. The same holds,\naccording to him, for the fixed and stable figure of stars (KOS:\n236).\n\nTaurellus discusses two ways in which something \u201cflows\u201d\nfrom one being to another: the \u201cflowing\u201d of substance, and\nthe \u201cflowing\u201d of accidents (KOS: 238). According to the\nlate scholastic concepts of accident and substance shared by Taurellus\n(see, e.g., AC: 48\u201349), accidents are entities that inhere in\nanother being, while substances are entities that do not inhere in\nanother being. If a new accident of a substance is produced by this\nsubstance, we have an instance of immanent causation: a causal\nrelation within one and the same being. If a substance produces a new\naccident, one could plausibly assume that such a causal relation does\nnot diminish the substance from which the new accident arises, because\nit is an effect that inheres in it. Taurellus holds that this is the\nonly conceivable conception of how something can to be said\n\u201cin\u201d God: divine attributes \u201ccomplete\u201d the\ndivine essence (DRA: 458). But he maintains that such a conception of\nthe \u201cflowing\u201d of accidents is of no help when it comes to\nanalyze the relation between God and natural beings. As he argues, due\nto the self-sufficiency of elements, elements are the true subjects of\ninherence of their accidents. Hence, they belong to the category of\nsubstance, not to the category of accidents. Therefore, also a world\ncomposed of elements does not belong to the category of accidents\n(KOS: 62\u201363). Consequently, a world composed of elements cannot\ninhere in the divine substance (KOS: 238; DRA: 459).\n7. Aftermath\n\nAlthough Taurellus\u2019s publications in metaphysics can be read as\na sustained philosophical defense of the Christian doctrine of\ncreation, his work triggered polemical opposition from orthodox\nLutheran theologians (see Feuerlein 1734). Apart from blatantly\nmisguided but highly derogatory allegations of atheism, some of his\ncontemporaries saw a connection between Taurellus\u2019s views and\nthe views of two other controversial thinkers. One of them is the\natomistic natural philosopher David Gorlaeus (1591\u20131612), the\nother is the Arminian theologian Conrad Vorstius (1569\u20131622)\n(L\u00fcthy 2001: 278\u2013286, L\u00fcthy 2012: 122\u2013129, and\nL\u00fcthy 2018).\n\nThe connection between Taurellus and Gorlaeus seems to be particularly\ndirect because Gorlaeus develops a long series of arguments in support\nof the claim that a human being is \u201cone being by aggregation,\nnot by essence\u201d (Gorlaeus 1620: 222\u2013234; on Gorlaeaus, see\nLasswitz 1890: vol. 1, pp. 455\u2013463; Gregory 1966: 46\u201351;\nL\u00fcthy 2012). Moreover, to spell out the implications of such a\nview of composites Gorlaeus presents a fully developed theory of\nmaterial atoms, according to which nature is constituted by minimal,\nquantitative, indivisible, and corporeal particles interspersed with\nsmall regions of vacuum (Gorlaeus 1620: 239\u2013243). The close\nconnection between the endorsement of the existence of material atoms\nand the denial of the existence of composite unities in Gorlaeus made\nit tempting for Taurellus\u2019s contemporaries to conjecture that\nsuch a close connection could be found also in Taurellus (see Voetius\n1643: 28). However, a close look into Taurellus\u2019s account of\nelements (see above\n section 2)\n shows that the unities that produce beings \u201cby\naggregation\u201d are not to be understood in analogy to material\natoms. The supposed closeness between the views of Taurellus and\nGorlaeus thus rests on a misinterpretation of the ontology of the\nTriumph of Philosophy.\n\nIn critical responses to Vorstius, Taurellus has also been charged\nwith having been the author of the view that God is a limited\nquantitative being\u2014a view that his critics also ascribed to\nVorstius ([Anonymous] 1611: 8\u20139; Vorstius 1611: 22\u201323; see\nShriver 1970). As to the view that Vorstius\u2019s critics ascribed\nboth to Vorstius and to Taurellus (the view that God is a\nquantum that is limited and possesses accidents), it turns\nout, that such a reading does not adequately represent either\nVorstius\u2019s or Taurellus\u2019s views concerning divine\nextension. Vorstius holds that God is infinite not only with respect\nto duration and potency but also with respect to omnipresence\n(Vorstius 1610: 221). Because God is omnipresent, there is a\nquantitative aspect to his nature; however, Vorstius is clear that\n\n\n\nthis does not relate to physical or corporeal and sensible quantity\nbut has to be understood with respect to the true and by no means\nfictional but evidently for us imperceptible and spiritual magnitude\nof God. (Vorstius 1611: 2) \n\n\nAlso, Vorstius emphasizes that he \n\n\nnever claimed that God is finite unless perhaps in the sense that God\nis a definite being, that is, a determinate being on its own that is\ndistinct from other beings. (1611: 2\u20133) \n\n\nAccordingly, when Vorstius talks of the \u201cplace\u201d of God, he\ndoes not mean any physical place in the Aristotelian sense\u2014a\nplace defined by the boundaries of other bodies\u2014but rather\nwishes to express the view that God extends throughout the whole of\nspace (1611: 3).\n\nOn first sight, the views of Vorstius may seem to differ from\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of divine infinity, because\nTaurellus\u2019s conception seems to involve a sense in which God is\na material being. Consider the following passage: \n\n\nWe say that God is almighty both in the sense that he has an infinite\npotency due to his substance, and in the sense that he also has\ninfinite matter due to his essential characteristics, that is, one\nthat in no way hinders the agent through any potency of acting. (PT:\n484) \n\n\nHowever, although infinite matter, in a certain sense, seems to be\nincluded among the essential characteristics of God, Taurellus here\ngives an explication that clearly marks talk of \u201cinfinite\nmatter\u201d as metaphorical. \u201cInfinite matter\u201d as a\nmetaphor for the infinite divine potencies indicates that there are no\nfurther potencies that could function as an external impediment to\ndivine agency. Such a metaphorical usage of the notion of infinite\nmatter evidently does not imply that God has material (and, hence,\nlimited) properties.\n\nTaurellus thus cannot be understood as an atheist, an atomist, or a\nproponent of a theory of a material God. Nevertheless, the opposition\nthat Taurellus met during his lifetime was highly successful in\nraising suspicions in the minds of his contemporaries, and there are\nvirtually no references to his thought in subsequent publications by\nProtestant metaphysicians (on Taurellus\u2019s immediate successors,\nsee Sparn 1976). However, his work was by no means forgotten. It is\ndocumented that Jacob Thomasius (1622\u20131684), one of\nLeibniz\u2019s academic teachers, owned most of Taurellus\u2019s\nbooks (Schmid 1860: 19). Leibniz himself gave to Taurellus the epithet\nof \u201cthe Scaliger of the Germans\u201d (Feller 1718:\n142)\u2014no small compliment given the fact that the young Leibniz\nregarded Julius Caesar Scaliger as one of his models for an eclectic,\nconciliatory approach to philosophy (Leibniz 1923\u2013: II, 1, p.\n90).\n\nAlthough there are only some very few explicit references to Taurellus\nin Leibniz\u2019s writings, the nineteenth-century German philosopher\nLudwig Feuerbach (1804\u20131872) has suggested that the similarities\nbetween Taurellus and Leibniz may run much deeper than one would\nexpect. Feuerbach\u2019s suggestion is based on two considerations:\n(1) Taurellus\u2019s view of the active powers of the human mind\nbears similarities to Leibniz\u2019s conception of the inherently\nactive nature of human cognition; and (2) Taurellus\u2019s defense of\nsubstance pluralism and creation theory against Cesalpino bears\nsimilarities to Leibniz\u2019s defense of substance pluralism and\ncreation theory against Spinoza (Feuerbach 1981: 192\u2013193). If\none adds to Feuerbach\u2019s observations the similarities between\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of immaterial form-like unities as the\nultimate constituents of reality and Leibniz\u2019s conception of\nimmaterial, simple substances as grounding the physical world, then\nTaurellus may emerge as the thinker who, within the context of\nProtestant metaphysics, came closest to anticipating central elements\nof Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[Anonymous], 1611, <em>Bedenckingen.
