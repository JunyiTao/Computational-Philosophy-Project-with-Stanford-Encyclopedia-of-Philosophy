    "main_text": "\n\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection is, perhaps, the crowning\nintellectual achievement of the biological sciences. There is,\nhowever, considerable debate about which entity or entities are\nselected and what it is that fits them for that role. This article\naims to clarify what is at issue in these debates by identifying four\ndistinct, though often confused, concerns and then identifying how the\ndebates on what constitute the units of selection depend to a\nsignificant degree on which of these four questions a thinker regards\nas central.\n",
