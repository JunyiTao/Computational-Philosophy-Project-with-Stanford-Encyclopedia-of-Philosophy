    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as generators of classical geometry || Can it be an empirical problem?\n4. What needs to be done next?\n\nThe first task to do seems rather straightforward: take any of the\nproposals presented here and elaborate them into a full-fledged\ngeometry. Then it will be possible to make a comparison with, e.g.,\nHilbert\u2019s axiomatisation that was mentioned. The second task\nseems rather forbidding: using this discrete geometry, show how to do\nphysics. In general terms, this is indeed a huge undertaking, but\nthere are two possible routes to follow. The first route is to show\nthat this approach works, say, for classical mechanics. If successful,\nthis would surely count as a major argument in favor of discrete\nproposals. As it happens, some very important work has already been\ndone, for what we will need, is a fully formalized version of\nclassical mechanics, not the textbook versions that leave many things\nunmentioned, but that might prove to be crucial for the underlying\ngeometry. Such versions exist at the present moment, see, e.g., Ax\n(1978), Andr\u00e9ka et al. (2008), Benda (2008), Ardourel (2012)\nfor just a few examples. As it happens, one of the earliest versions\ninvolves Patrick Suppes, see McKinsey, Sugar & Suppes (1953). Thus\nthe enterprise seems to be a genuine possibility. The second route is\nto keep exploring the fundamental research going on in the search for\na unification of QFT and GRT. Up to some years ago this was all highly\nspeculative, today a few serious contestants are emerging and worth\nfollowing up. That being said, both on the mathematical as on the\nphysical level an enormous amount of work remains to be done. Probably\nthe best way to characterize the present-day situation is that some\n\u201cfamous\u201d objections to a discrete or finitist approach in\ngeometry have been (partially) answered and that a host of\nmathematical, physical and philosophical suggestions and ideas have\nbeen presented, and partial models have been developed or are being\nelaborated. In other words, the conditions are satisfied that make it\ninteresting to continue this research program.\n",
