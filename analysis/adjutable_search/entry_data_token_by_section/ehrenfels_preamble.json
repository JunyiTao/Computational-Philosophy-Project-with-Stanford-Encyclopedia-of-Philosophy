    "main_text": "\nChristian von Ehrenfels (b. June 20, 1859, d. September 8, 1932) was an\nAustrian philosopher and psychologist from the school of Franz\nBrentano. He proved himself to be a highly independent and diverse\nthinker by formulating the notion of Gestalt qualities,\nelaborating on a new theory of value, and developing new ideas in\nsexual ethics and cosmology. He drew on what he learned not only from\nBrentano, but also from Alexius Meinong, the Austrian economists, and\nevolution theorists. Nevertheless, Ehrenfels (as he shall henceforth be\ndesignated) was also critical of his various mentors on a number of\nissues. Though he was very much a theorist, he was by no means aloof\nregarding the social and cultural problems of his time. Thus he also\nattempted to respond to these problems by forging new paths towards their\nsolutions.\n",
