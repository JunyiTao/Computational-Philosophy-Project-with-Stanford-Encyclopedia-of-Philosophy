    "main_text": "Sequences, Action, Inaction and Positive and Negative Rights\n6. Sequences, Action, Inaction and Positive and Negative Rights\n\nBoth Philippa Foot and Warren Quinn attempt to defend the moral\nrelevance of the doing/allowing distinction by connecting it with a\nmoral distinction between positive and negative rights. \n\nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the difference between doing and\nallowing harm is at heart a difference in the agent\u2019s\nrelationship to a harmful sequence. We are able to pick out the\nsequence leading to a harmful upshot. Foot distinguishes between\ninitiating (setting the harmful sequence going); sustaining (keeping\nthe harmful sequence going when it would otherwise have stopped);\nenabling (removing some barrier which would have brought the harmful\nsequence to a halt) and forbearing to prevent (failing to take some\naction which would have brought the sequence to a halt). Initiating\nand sustaining both count as doing harm; enabling and forbearing to\nprevent are ways of merely allowing harm. Foot is clear that, in her\nview, the doing/allowing distinction is not the same as the\naction/omission distinction. \u201c[Forbearing to prevent] requires\nan omission but there is no other general correlation between omission\nand allowing, commission and bringing about or doing. An actor who\nfails to turn up for a performance will generally spoil it rather than\nallow it to be spoiled\u201d (Foot, 1978, 26) \n\nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the moral relevance of the doing\n/allowing distinction rests on a distinction between positive and\nnegative rights. Negative rights are rights against interference\nwhereas positive rights are rights to aid or support. Negative rights\nare, in general, stronger than positive rights: it typically takes\nmore to justify an interference than to justify the withholding of\ngoods and services. Foot connects this to her analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction by arguing that interference implies\nbreaking into an existing sequence and initiating a new one and that\ntherefore violation of a right of non-interference must involve doing,\nrather than merely allowing, harm (Foot, 1984, 284).\n\nWarren Quinn (1989) shares Foot\u2019s view that the doing/allowing\ndistinction rests on the difference between positive and negative\nrights, but offers both an alternative analysis and a deeper defense\nof the claim that negative rights are stronger than positive rights.\nWhile Foot argues that these is no necessary connection between action\nand doing or inaction and mere allowing, Quinn treats the\naction/inaction distinction as fundamental to the analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction. On Quinn\u2019s view, an agent is\npositively relevant to a harmful upshot when his most direct\ncontribution to the harm is an action, whether his own or that of some\n object.[14]\n His relevance is negative when his most direct contribution is an\ninaction, a failure to prevent the harm. An agent\u2019s most direct\ncontribution to a harmful upshot of his agency is the contribution\nthat most directly explains the harm. One contribution explains harm\nmore directly than another if the explanatory value of the second is\nexhausted in the way it explains the first.\n\nThe key difference for Quinn is between cases where the agent produces\nthe result by an action and cases where she produces it by an\ninaction\u2014pushing someone\u2019s head under water or refraining\nfrom throwing a life preserver. Quinn holds that we do not need\nfurther analysis of the action/inaction distinction. However, Quinn\nadds a modification to his account which means that he does not treat\nthe doing/allowing distinction and the action/inaction distinction as\nthe same. Sometimes, Quinn says, your relevance to a death can be\npositive, you can kill, in other words, even though you don\u2019t\nact. This happens, for example, when you are on a train headed towards\nsome drowning victims you wish to save when you notice someone tied to\nthe tracks ahead of you. You can stop the train but you choose not to\nin order to reach your destination. Quinn believes that you kill in\nthis case, because the train acts as your agent, taking you where you\nwant to go, and crushing the person tied to the tracks in the process.\nOn the other hand, if you had chosen not to stop the train for some\nother reason but you would have not minded had someone else stopped\nthe train, then your failure to stop the train would not have\nconstituted a killing.\n\nLike Foot, Quinn believes that the key here is the distinction between\nnegative and positive\n rights.[15]\n Doing harm involves the violation of negative rights; merely allowing\nharm involves the violation of positive rights. Since negative rights\nare more stringent than positive rights, doing harm is harder to\njustify than merely allowing harm (ceteris paribus). Quinn\nagrees with Foot that negative rights are intuitively stronger than\npositive rights. However, Quinn seeks to provide further argument by\nlinking the precedence of negative rights over positive rights with\nthe conditions for a person\u2019s body to genuinely belong to him:\n\n\n[i]n such a morality [neutral vis \u00e1 vis killing and letting\ndie] the person trapped on the road has a moral say about whether his\nbody may be destroyed only if what he stands to lose is greater than\nwhat others stand to gain. But then surely he has no real say at all.\nFor, in cases where his loss would be greater than the gain to others,\nthe fact that he could not be killed would be sufficiently explained\nnot by his authority in the matter but simply by the balance of\noverall costs. And if this is how it is in general\u2014if we may\nrightly injure or kill him whenever others stand to gain more than he\nstands to lose\u2014then surely his body (one might say his person)\nis not in any interesting moral sense his. It seems rather to belong\nto the human community, to be dealt with according to its best overall\ninterest\u2026. Whether we are speaking of ownership or more\nfundamental forms of possession, something is, morally speaking, his\nonly if his say over what may be done to it (and thereby to him) can\noverride the greater needs of others (Quinn 1989, 308\u2013309).\n\n\nTo say that one has a negative right against being harmed is to say\nthat it is (at least, prima facie) wrong to harm one unless one wishes\nto be harmed. It is crucial that we add the phrase \u201cunless one\nwishes to be harmed\u201d, since without it, the precedence of\nnegative rights wouldn\u2019t give the victim any special say about\nhis own body, because it would be just as wrong to harm him even if he\nasked to be harmed, and it would be wrong for him to harm himself. So,\nthe crucial thing is that the victim has some sort of a say about what\nhappens to himself(i.e., others are morally bound to respect his\nwishes with respect to his body to a certain extent). Quinn\u2019s\nclaim is that if there is no extent to which someone\u2019s wishes\nwith respect to his body, etc. are to be respected, then we\u2019ve\ncompletely done away with the idea of ownership of one\u2019s body,\netc. One person\u2019s wishes about what happens to her body do often\nclash with someone else\u2019s wishes about what happen to his. For\nexample, Susan wishes to marry Paul, but Paul doesn\u2019t wish to\nmarry Susan. Morality obviously cannot give all such wishes\nprecedence. So, we need to give some subset of them precedence. Quinn\nargues that we cannot give positive rights precedence over negative\nrights without\n incoherence.[16]\n And, hence, he concludes that we must give negative rights precedence\nover positive rights.\n\nHoward-Snyder(2002) has argued that Quinn\u2019s defense does not\nshow that we should endorse the distinction between doing and allowing\nrather than some alternative distinction: \u201c...there are other\nways to divide up rights than the division into positive and negative\nrights. We might divide them into the rights of children and the\nrights of adults, rights concerning the upper half of the body and\nrights concerning the lower half, etc. and then give precedence to one\nset over the other whenever they come into conflict. These seem\narbitrary and wasteful, but their rationale seems no worse than\nQuinn\u2019s. Quinn\u2019s is a funny sort of defense of negative\nrights. Unless I\u2019m missing something, it doesn\u2019t pick out\nany special feature of negative rights that makes them specially worth\nrespecting\u201d (Howard-Snyder 2002).\n\nWoollard (2013, 2015) attempts to fill this gap in Quinn\u2019s\nargument, offering a new analysis of the doing/allowing distinction\nand using the notion of imposition to link the distinction, so\nanalysed, to the conditions for genuine ownership. \n\nWoollard returns to Foot\u2019s (1978, 1984, 1985) sequence account.\nHowever, she argues that Foot\u2019s account is incomplete because it\ndoes not tell us how to distinguish enabling from sustaining, why\nenabling is grouped with forbearing to prevent, or what sustaining and\ninitiating have in common. On Woollard\u2019s view, the key question\nis whether the relevant fact about the agent\u2019s behavior is part\nof the sequence leading to harm. Woollard distinguishes between\nsubstantial and non-substantial facts. Substantial facts are by nature\nsuitable to be part of a sequence. Non-substantial facts normally\ncount as mere conditions for a sequence. Thus anything that is\nrelevant to a sequence through a non-substantial fact will normally be\na mere condition rather than part of the sequence. However,\nnon-substantial facts can count as relatively substantial and part of\na sequence under special circumstances, if for example, they are facts\nabout the absence of a barrier that belongs to the victim.\n\nThis leaves Woollard with the following account: If an agent is merely\nrelevant to a harm through a non-substantial fact about her body or\nbelongings then her behavior will be merely a condition for, rather\nthan part of, the harmful sequence. She will count as merely allowing\nharm. In contrast, if there is a complete sequence of substantial\nfacts leading from the agent to an harmful affect on what belongs to\nthe victim or a third party, her behavior will be part of the harmful\nsequence and she will count as doing harm. Woollard uses this analysis\nto connect the doing/allowing distinction and imposition. Imposition\ninvolves the needs or behavior of one person intruding upon the proper\nsphere of another. When an agent does harm, there is a sequence of\nsubstantial facts connecting her behavior to an unwanted effect on\nwhat belongs to this victim: this is a harmful causal imposition. When\nan agent is forbidden from allowing harm, she is required to make some\nsubstantial fact about her body or her belongings true for the sake of\nanother. Finally, Woollard argues that for our bodies and other\nbelongings to genuinely belong to us we require protection from both\ncausal and normative imposition: we require constraints against doing\nharm and permissions to allow harm. \n\nLike Quinn and Woollard, Frances Kamm (1996, 2007) also appeals to the\nidea of rights or entitlements. Kamm argues that letting die has two\nessential properties which can make letting die more acceptable than\nkilling: (1) the victim only loses life that he would have had with\nthe agent\u2019s help at that time; (2) the alternative is for the\nagent to be interfered with. These features make a moral difference\nbecause the victim has a stronger claim (relative to the agent) to\nwhat he has independently of that agent\u2019s current efforts. Kamm\nargues that these features are essential properties of a letting die,\nbut may also be found in some cases of killing and such killings will\nbe morally equivalent to merely letting die. \n",
