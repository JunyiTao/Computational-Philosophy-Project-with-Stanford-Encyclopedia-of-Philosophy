What is the Place of Humankind in the World? || Ethics\n4.1 Ethics\n\nBefore we can resolve fundamental problems regarding ethical norms,\nduties, rights, or happiness, Hartmann argues, we have to ask\n\u201cwhat is valuable?\u201d in the first place. The traditional\nmoral question \u201cwhat ought we to do?\u201d, posed by the\nKantian ethics of duty, presupposes the more fundamental axiological\nquestion, \u201cwhat is valuable in life and the world\ngenerally?\u201d (ET1Intro5) What is \u201cpractical\u201d about\nethics is not that it helps us find the means to reach ends, but that\nit helps us identify the ends of action themselves (ET1Intro3). These\nends are values. In the Ethics, the only book to be\ntranslated into English in his lifetime, Hartmann rejects the putative\nsubjectivism, formalism, and intellectualism of Kantian ethics, and\ndraws on Aristotelian virtue ethics for inspiration. Although he was\nmainly influenced by Max Scheler\u2019s Formalism in Ethics\n(1973 [1916]), which argues for a moral realism of values, Hartmann\ndeparts significantly from his approach in many ways (Kelly 2011a;\nR\u00f6mer 2012). Hartmann also responded to Nietzsche\u2019s call\nfor a \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of values, developed a typology of\ndistinctively Modern values out of Nietzsche\u2019s work, and defined\na moderate position between the extremes of value absolutism and value\nrelativism. Like his conception of problems, his conception of values\ncarefully distinguishes between the transhistorical and the\nhistorical.\n\nThe same kind of argument used in the previous work, which begins with\ncomplex \u201cfacts\u201d and reasons to their necessary conditions,\nis used in the Ethics. Hartmann held that the phenomena of\nmoral exemplarity, the idealization of moral types, the phenomena of\nself-criticism and accountability, conscience, and even the historical\ndominance of content-oriented virtue theory, all testify to an a\npriori, intuitive sense for values. But Hartmann does not erect\nan intuitionism of values out of this. A persistent theme throughout\nhis ethics is that morality is a creative enterprise, that it demands\na discerning sense for values and creative efforts at synthesis that\nengage the whole person. \u201cEthics applies itself to the creative\npower in man,\u201d he claims, and it awakens \u201cman\u2019s\ncreative, spontaneous, living sense of what ought to be, of what in\nitself is valuable\u201d (ET1Intro2). He repeatedly asserts that\nmoral life is life in the midst of conflicts of value, and that these\nconflicts are almost never cleanly resolved. \u201cReal moral life is\nnot such that one can stand guiltless in it. And that each person must\nstep by step in life settle conflicts, insoluble theoretically, by his\nown free sense of values and his own creative energy, should be\nregarded as a feature of the highest spiritual significance in\ncomplete humanity and genuine freedom\u201d (ET2 25b).\n\nWhile a novel axiology constitutes the core of Hartmann\u2019s\ninnovative approach, his treatment of the \u201cproblem of\nfreedom\u201d in the last part of the book is also as groundbreaking\nas it is unique. He dissects the problem of freedom and reveals\n\u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d to be a novel form of determination in\nthe world. Rejecting Scheler\u2019s \u201cmetaphysical\npersonalism\u201d as resting on a teleological prejudice, Hartmann\nconceives of human beings as meaning-makers who realize values in\naction. Their \u201cplace in the world\u201d is to bring values into\nreality which without them would otherwise remain unrealized (ET2\n11h). Elsewhere he states that \u201chumankind is the trustee\n(Sachwalter) of values and of the ought in the real world.\nHuman beings are the intermediary that implements them in\nactuality\u201d (S 40; P14f). Because aesthetic values and objects\nare some of the most meaningful and significant for human beings, he\nalso develops an extensive analysis of them in one of his final\nworks.\n\nOn reading the Ethics, the overall impression is of a kind of\ncautious optimism in face of an apathetic and pessimistic Modern\nculture. Hartmann was familiar with both Nietzsche\u2019s and\nScheler\u2019s critiques of ressentiment and Modern culture\n(Nietzsche 1989 [1887]; Scheler 1994 [1914]), but Hartmann believes\nthat the human sense for values can be cultivated, that we can learn\nto see the value abundance in the world and our relations to others\nagain, and that we can be creative actualizers of higher values in the\nworld. But to make this possible, what is first needed, counter to the\nlong ethical tradition, is to make the \u201ccentral task\u201d of\nethics \u201can analysis of the contents of values\u201d\n(ET1Foreword). Against the formalism and intellectualism of Kantian\nethics, it highlights the importance of our affective sense of values;\nagainst the relativism and subjectivism of Nietzsche, it shows that\nthere are universal features of value experience and a structure to\nthe domain of values which can give some guidance in prioritizing and\nsynthesizing values in conflict.\n\nValues, for Hartmann, are ideal entities. Mathematical entities and\nvalues \u201cexist\u201d in an atemporal way, and have their own\ndeterminations. In short, temporality is what radically distinguishes\nreal categories from ideal categories, and apart from temporality,\nindividuality is the second feature distinguishing real being from\nideal being. Everything ideal is general, and everything real is\nindividual. Everything real is unique and it exists only once. The\ngeneral in reality is real only \u201cin\u201d individuals (A37e).\nGiven the thesis that there are at least these two main types of ideal\nentities, what else is shared by the entities included in the sphere\nof ideal being? Hartmann considers the following three general\nfeatures. 1) The overall geography of both mathematical entities and\nvalues is unknown. The constant efforts of the best minds and the\naccumulated experience of humankind have been able to explore some of\ntheir territories, and partially to map their landmarks. The overall\nshape of mathematics and the overall shape of the territory of values,\nhowever, are far from being charted. 2) Both the region of\nmathematical entities and the region of values extend beyond the\nboundaries of real being. Many mathematical structures are far from\nbeing exemplified in reality and some will never be. The same patently\napplies to values. 3) Both mathematics and ethics claim universality.\nThis is part of their nature as ideal beings. On the other hand,\nneither mathematics nor ethics are able to capture\u2014from their\nown point of view\u2014the whole of reality. There is no single\nmathematical model of the world, and there are no good reasons to\nbelieve that there will ever be one. Similarly, there is no single\nethical understanding of the whole of human experience, and there are\nno good reasons to believe that there will ever be one. This last\nissue is especially important from an ontological point of view,\nbecause it shows that the universality of both mathematics and ethics\nis different from the universality of ontology (Poli 2009a,b).\n\nNevertheless, an analogous relation between the transhistorical and\nhistorical prevails here as in Hartmann\u2019s understanding of\nproblems, and, as we will see, in his understanding of categories.\nThere is a transhistorical content to values that is exemplified in\nvaried cultural and historical contexts and individual actions, in the\nsame way that there is a transhistorical problem content that is\naddressed by various thinkers in different places and times. In the\ncontext of the ethics, Hartmann employs the \u201cspotlight\u201d\nmetaphor to account for the shifting structure of value preferences\nand value consciousness in different times and places, while\nvalue-contents themselves are unchanging. From the whole realm of\nvalues, value consciousness \u201ccuts out a little circle of\nsomething seen\u201d and this circle \u201cwanders about\u201d the\nideal realm of values (ET1 6a; AE27e; Cadwallader 1984). Human beings\nhave affective access to the full range of values, but their cultural\nethos only presents them with a limited selection of this range. The\nindividual capacity to \u201csee\u201d values also changes with age\nand axiological maturity. Groups and communities change by following\ndifferent guiding values. This latter case shows how historical and\nsocial conditions are at work in shaping the territory of accessible\nvalues. The interplay between individuals and the groups to which they\nbelong finds moments of stability in the mutually adjusted selection\nof shared values. Repeated acts of valuation tend to produce stable or\nfixed orders of individual and social preferences, or ethos,\nwhose guiding values press to be realized. The current\n\u201cmaintenance-loss\u201d model of language acquisition (Black et\nal. 1998)\u2014which basically means \u201cuse it or lose\nit\u201d\u2014would also seem to apply in the case of cultural value\npreferences and patterns of valuation. New visions and corresponding\nbehaviors can be rejected, or they may occasionally be accepted and\ncontribute to behaviors shaped by different values.\n\nThe second part of Hartmann\u2019s massive tome is comprised of an\nextensive survey of western values, including ancient Greek,\nChristian, and Modern values. Valuational conditions in the subject,\nour sense of agency, and environmental values form the prerequisites\nfor the lasting fulfillment of genuinely moral values. The elementary\nconditions in the subject are life, consciousness, and personality.\nThe last of these contains a number of values within itself: activity,\nsuffering, strength, freedom, foresight, and purposefulness (ET2\n11a-h). The elementary conditions in the object are the goods and\nsituational values, such as environmental conditions, the causal\nnexus, material possessions, community and family, and social goods\n(law, language, knowledge, education, and\n\u201cfree-association\u201d). Goods and situations are not moral\nvalues, but they are morally relevant, and are the conditions of\nhaving moral values at all (ET2 12a-g).\n\nPurposefulness in a way sums up the other conditions in the subject,\nand also designates a structure of ontological determination unique to\nhumankind, which Hartmann calls the \u201cfinalistic nexus.\u201d\nOur purposefulness is what allows us \u201cto actualize values which\nwithout our help would remain unreal\u201d (ET2 11h), and it\nstructures all forms of practical intention, from striving and willing\nto hoping and taking on attitudes. He defines the finalistic nexus as\na three-part structure: 1) affirming or setting up the end in\nanticipation (which presupposes values and value perception); 2)\nworking backwards from the end to the nearest means leading up to it,\nand so on, back to the first step; 3) actualizing the end through the\nseries of means in the real temporal and causal order (ET1 20c). In\nthis analysis, finalism is not something opposed to causality, but\nobviously requires causality, and this \u201cplus\u201d of\ndetermination inserts itself into the many-layered causal series.\nNaturalism misunderstands this because it fails to see purposefulness\nproperly as noncausal (ET1 20e). The significance of this analysis of\nfinalism is decisive for his ethics and philosophical anthropology in\ngeneral, especially in the discussion of freedom of the will, and is\nalso important because it forms the basis for the critique of\nteleological metaphysics that Hartmann embraces from the beginning to\nthe end of his career.\n\nThe core of his axiological analysis focuses on moral values in the\nwestern ethical tradition. He considers a handful of general or\nfundamental values, including the good, the noble, richness of\nexperience, and purity, before launching into more detailed analyses\nof three historically dominant clusters of values stemming from\nancient Greek, Christian, and Modern morality, all of which continue\nto carry normative force today. In the Greek group, Hartmann covers\njustice, wisdom, courage, and self-control, and discusses\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the mean with reference to values such as\ngenerosity, ambition, and magnanimity. The core value of the Christian\ngroup of values is brotherly love. This kind of love is directed at\nwhomever is nearest, to the other person as person (ET2 24a).\nTruthfulness, reliability, faith, modesty, and humility are other\nvalues that fall in this group. In contrast to these historical\nclusters, there are also values associated with the impulse to\ntransform them, turning against comfort, tradition, and inertia,\nexhibiting a striving for progress, chasing ideals that go beyond the\nlife of the individual. It is hard to name some values in this third\ngroup because they are so new, but Hartmann calls the first value\n\u201clove of the remotest,\u201d following Nietzsche. It is love\nfor the ideal of humankind as it should be, and knows that ignoring\nthis ideal is wrong. Radiant virtue (Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cschenkende Tugend\u201d; see Nietzsche 2006) is\nconnected to the present. It is the sense of spiritual fullness,\nimparting to others spiritual goods, an overflowing ability to share,\nto broadcast values, and the delight in so doing.\n\u201cPersonality\u201d is the sense that each person has a unique\ncharacter and complex ideal personality that they \u201cought\u201d\nto approximate as best they can. It is a new norm for the person. The\nsingularity of personal behavior is as much an \u201cought\u201d as\nis the universal ought. His descriptions and discussions of many of\nthe values considered central to western morality, especially of the\nModern ethos (ET2 30e-33f), are fascinating and worth sustained\nattention.\n\nHartmann also discusses the structure of the value realm that we can\ndiscern, even if we cannot map it in its entirety. Two organizing\nprinciples of the value domain are especially important: that of\nstrength and that of height. The strength of a value is indicated by\nthe gravity of its violation, while the height of a value is expressed\nin the merit deriving from its fulfillment. These two principles\noperate in opposite directions: the strongest values are also the\nlowest values, while the highest values are the least strong ones.\nUsually, lower values are simpler (that is, they possess less\nintuitable content) while higher values are more complex. The laws of\nstrength and height have significant consequences, the two most\nimportant of which are the following: 1) violating a lower value is a\nmore serious offense than violating a higher value; 2) fulfilling a\nhigher value is a greater good than fulfilling a lower value. In\nHartmann\u2019s words, \u201csinning against lower values is\nignominious, shameful, revolting, but their fulfillment only reaches\nthe level of decency, without rising above it. Offending against\nhigher values, by contrast, does indeed have the character of moral\nfailure, but nothing of the directly degrading, while fulfillment of\nthese values may have something uplifting, liberating, indeed\nthrilling about it\u201d (ET2 28e). Offending against life is a grave\noffense, while respecting it has very little merit. But the\nfulfillment of spiritual goods is a merit much greater than the merit\ncorresponding to respect for more elementary goods, such as\nenvironmental goods. If the architecture of values is based on levels\nof dependence, then the ethos of a person whose behavior is oriented\nto a higher value, but who does not simultaneously respect the values\nthat support it, is structurally discordant. The higher values to\nwhich she refers are not sustainable. Loving with distrust or giving\nwith cowardice are not authentically virtuous behaviors (ET2 63f). A\npattern of valuation is constructed step by step from the most\nelementary levels upwards.\n\nValue antinomies and conflicts also structure the domain of values.\nSome typical conflicts include that between justice, which demands the\nsame treatment for all, and personal love, which demands special\ntreatment for one individual. The value of personality stands in\nantinomic relation to universal values like justice and brotherly\nlove, both of which demand a certain kind of equality. There are\nvarious forms of contrast, not just antinomy proper. The clash between\nuniversal and personal, and between present and future are others, and\nin a way all values conflict with each other in concrete situations\n(ET2 36g). In light of these clashes, a frequent source of error is\nfetishizing one value at the expense of others, leading to the tyranny\nof a single value. Fanaticism of justice which attacks love,\nfanaticism of love which leads to self-sacrifice, fanaticism of love\nof the remote which becomes a hatred of the present (Nietzsche) are\nsome typical cases. In a way, every value taken to an extreme is a\ndanger, so avoiding extremes through synthesis is crucial. \u201cOnly\na sense of justice which is at the same time loving, only a brotherly\nlove which also considers the far distant, only a pride which would\nlikewise be humble, could be valid as an ideal of moral conduct\u201d\n(ET2 36g). He goes so far as to say that values reach fulfillment only\nin synthesis with others.\n\nThe ever-present conflicts of values are also a condition of personal\nfreedom, because no decision would be needed if there were no conflict\n(ET3 16e). Hartmann\u2019s analysis of freedom covers the various\nsenses of autonomy exposed by Kant\u2019s ethical theory, but adds\nanother layer that responds directly to the problem of value conflict.\nBecause the actual ethical existence of the person is\n\u201chigher\u201d than values, freedom is incompatible with\ncomplete determination of the person by a higher\nprinciple\u2014whether god, duty, or even values (ET3 16f). Freedom\ncannot bear the form of an ought at all. Interestingly, Hartmann was\nclear about this long before Sartre. Freedom has to be regarded as a\nplus of determination in face both of natural law and of moral law,\nontological and axiological determination (ET3 16g). By our actual\ninitiative we decide actual conflicts, and \u201cpersonal\nautonomy\u201d is the person\u2019s capacity to endorse values, to\ntransform a value into one\u2019s own determinant, to commit or not\nto commit oneself to a value, and values are impotent without our\ncommitment to them. We are the mediators of the ought in reality, and\nonly personal commitment to them can bring them to actualization (ET3\n17c). This explicitly opposes any simple intuitionism about\nvalues.\n\nAs readers may have noted, this position on freedom resonates with\nlater existentialist thinking, and like it, levelled devastating\narguments against any form of metaphysics that imposed any form of\ndetermination on humankind. Hartmann\u2019s critique of teleological\nmetaphysics is one example of this (ET1 21b-d). The anthropomorphic\nroots of cosmic teleology stem from our own purposefulness. Its\nanthropomorphism is philosophically expressed in the assertion of the\nprimacy of axiological determination in the universe over ontological\ndetermination. While the finalistic nexus is a phenomenon of our\nstructure, it cannot be generalized to the structure of the universe,\nor we would overturn the basic ontological structure of the real\nworld, and this \u201cmetaphysical humanization of the Absolute is\nthe moral annulment of man\u201d (ET3 21d). Hartmann claims that if\nthe cosmos were teleologically oriented toward the good, then there\nwould be no place for what makes humankind unique in it. Hartmann\nconsiders \u201cdeliverance from the nightmare of teleology\u201d to\nbe one of the chief accomplishments of Modern philosophy, because with\nsuch a metaphysics genuine morality becomes impossible (ET3 5e). By\nrestricting finalism to its proper place, ethics rehabilitates\nhumankind, recognizing its limited but also weighty cosmic\nsignificance.\n",
