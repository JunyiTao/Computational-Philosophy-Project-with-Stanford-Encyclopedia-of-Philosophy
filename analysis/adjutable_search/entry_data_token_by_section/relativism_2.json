    "main_text": "What is Relativism? || Relativism by contrast\n1.2 Relativism by contrast\nA second approach to defining relativism casts its net more widely by focusing primarily on what relativists deny. Defined negatively, relativism amounts to the rejection of a number of interconnected philosophical positions. Traditionally, relativism is contrasted with:\nAbsolutism, the view that at least some truths or values in the relevant domain apply to all times, places or social and cultural frameworks. They are universal and not bound by historical or social conditions. Absolutism is often used as the key contrast idea to relativism.\nObjectivism or the position that cognitive, ethical and aesthetic norms and values in general, but truth in particular, are independent of judgments and beliefs at particular times and places, or in other words they are (non-trivially) mind-independent. The anti-objectivist on the other hand, denies that there is such thing as simply being \u2018true\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018tasty\u2019 or \u2018beautiful\u2019 but argues that we can coherently discuss such values only in relation to parameters that have something to do with our mental lives.\nMonism or the view that, in any given area or topic subject to disagreement, there can be no more than one correct opinion, judgment, or norm. The relativist often wishes to allow for a plurality of equally valid values or even truths.\nRealism, when defined in such a way that it entails both the objectivity and singularity of truth, also stands in opposition to relativism.\nRelativism in this negative sense is a prominent feature of the work of the relativists malgr\u00e9 eux such as Richard Rorty (1979) and Jacques Derrida (1974). What justifies the appellation \u2018relativist\u2019, rather than \u2018skeptic\u2019, is not only these philosophers\u2019 suspicion of the possibility of objectivity but their insistence on the role of socio-historical, psychological and textual contexts in accounts of \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019 claims.\n",
