    "main_text": "Luther, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche\n3. Luther, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche\n\nTwo other significant nineteenth century philosophers who engaged with\nLuther are S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u201355) and Friedrich\nNietzsche (1844\u20131900). For Kierkegaard, this engagement came in\nthe context of his attempts to renew the nature of Christian faith,\nwhile for Nietzsche it came from someone standing outside that\nfaith.\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s relation to Luther and Lutheranism is complex, and\nremains a matter of some\n controversy.[24]\n On balance, though, it seems that while Kierkegaard was clearly a\ncritic of the established Danish Lutheran Church, he was not so\ncritical of Luther himself, and partly returned to him in order to\nchallenge his Lutheran contemporaries, even suggesting that he might\nturn out to be Luther\u2019s \u201ctrue\n successor\u201d.[25]\n At the same time, he held that some of Luther\u2019s original\ndoctrines were partly responsible for the contemporary malaise, and so\nmust be re-thought in the context of new challenges to genuine\nChristian life and spirituality as conceived by Kierkegaard, thereby\napplying \u201ca corrective to Luther\u2019s own corrective\u201d,\nas Kim and Rasmussen nicely put it (2009: 197). His attitude is\ntherefore well-summarized in his remark: \n\n\nI have wanted to prevent people in Christendom from existentially\ntaking in vain Luther and the significance of Luther\u2019s life.\n(1850 [1998:\n 17])[26]\n\n\n\nThus while by his own admission Kierkegaard was not a systematic\nreader of\n Luther,[27]\n his engagement with his writings nonetheless relates to deep themes\nin Kierkegaard\u2019s own thinking, so that Luther provides an\nimportant context for his thought.\n\nOne such issue concerned the question of justification, and the\ncentral Lutheran view that this comes through unmerited grace as\nforgiveness rather than through works. While expressing sympathy with\nLuther\u2019s central claim, Kierkegaard was fearful that in his\ncontemporary world, it had become an excuse for an ethical and\nspiritual indolence, so that people now \u201capplied grace\nin such a way that they freed themselves from works\u201d\n(Kierkegaard 1851 [1990a: 17]). Relatedly, Kierkegaard acknowledged\nand respected the spiritual seriousness of the anxieties\n(Anfechtungen) and sense of sin which had led Luther himself\nto adopt this position (see Podmore 2006 and 2013); but this was a\nseriousness which Kierkegaard\u2019s contemporaries had lost, so that\nfor them the turn to grace becomes a superficial optimism rather than\na renewal of hope in the face of anxiety and despair. Moreover, like\nLuther, Kierkegaard closely connected our relation to God in faith\nwith our relation to the neighbour, so that it is through the former\nthat the latter as works of love are made\n possible.[28]\n In this way, Kierkegaard could claim to be correcting an exaggeration\nof Luther\u2019s position, which tried to do away with works\naltogether\u2014much as Luther himself had rejected this exaggeration\nin his Treatise on Good Works. In re-affirming the importance\nof works, Kierkegaard gave a greater role to the imitatio\nChristi tradition, again arguing that while Luther had been\nrightly critical of this idea in his own context as feeding works\nrighteousness and a kind of pseudo-piety, it nonetheless needs\nreviving in Kierkegaard\u2019s context, to provide a challenge to the\ncomplacent self-conception of his contemporaries by raising Christ up\nas an ideal, and to re-focus our attention on him as a radical figure\n(Kierkegaard 1876 [1990: 192\u2013209]).\n\nHowever, another obstacle to a proper life of faith for Kierkegaard\nwas the kind of worldliness to be found in his contemporaries, for\nwhich he claimed that Luther needed to take a more direct\nresponsibility, insofar as he had allowed the Reformation to become a\npolitical programme (see Kierkegaard KJP: 3, frag. 2469 [p. 66,\n1848]), and had also presented an account of social orders as a model\nof Christian life, which had been taken up by Hegelians and others as\nan ethic of vocation. For Kierkegaard, this had led to a relation\nbetween the religious on the one hand and the ethical and social on\nthe other that tended to reduce the former to the latter, and which he\nsought to challenge in his own more radical conception of their\nrelation, which could include the Christian having to live at odds\nwith any social order, and suffering exclusion from it as a\nresult\u2014or at the very least, active faith may require feeling\ndistanced from the world, while living within it. Again, while\nKierkegaard acknowledges that Luther may have intended something\n similar,[29]\n the result of his teachings had led people in a different direction;\nas Sl\u00f8k puts it: \n\n\nLife, serving one\u2019s neighbour through one\u2019s calling, had\nbeen transformed into one of bourgeois complacency in which relative\nduties and relative rights had obliterated the awareness of an\nunconditional obligation upon man. (Sl\u00f8k 1962: 100) \n\n\nIn this context, while recognizing that it could not be revived and\ncritical of it in some\n respects,[30]\n Kierkegaard expresses some preference for the monastic life over that\nof the married life of the Lutheran pastor, and the worldliness that\nhad come to\n involve.[31]\n\nA final theme to note concerns the relation between reason and faith,\nwhich also forms part of Kierkegaard\u2019s critical engagement with\nHegelianism. As discussed above, Hegel may be seen to have taken\nLutheranism in a more rationalistic and philosophical direction, to\nwhich Kierkegaard\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cparadox\u201d of the\nincarnation, which underlies Christian faith, as well as his emphasis\non divine hiddenness, may be seen as a corrective. For Kierkegaard,\nthis was essential to properly appreciate Luther\u2019s theology of\nthe cross, which because it is alien to rational comprehension, makes\nreligious commitment a matter of individual faith and existential\nrisk, as typified in the story of Abraham to which he and Luther both\n refer[32]\u2014though\n in his own way, Kierkegaard like Leibniz suggests that while this\nputs faith above reason, it does not put it contrary to it and so\nrender it irrational in that\n sense.[33]\n\nWhile Kierkegaard\u2019s criticisms of Luther come from within the\nChristian tradition, those of Nietzsche come from a thinker who put\nhimself outside\n it.[34]\n However, it took some time for this critique of Luther to develop,\nand in his earlier period until 1876 Nietzsche\u2019s writings are\nhighly favourable towards Luther himself and the Reformation\ngenerally; but from this point on, his view of both becomes\nincreasingly negative and hostile (see Bluhm 1943, 1950, 1953 for a\ndetailed account of this trajectory; this is also discussed in Large\n2003). For Nietzsche, Luther came to represent the paradigm of the\nnon-aristocratic man, who rather than accepting and overcoming\nhimself, instead despised himself and tried to flee from himself by\nturning to God. Thus, while Nietzsche may have seen in Luther a\nprefiguring of his own attempts to get beyond a morality of law in the\nname of\n freedom,[35]\n ultimately he came to view this liberating impetus as something\nLuther himself betrayed. More positively, however, while no direct\nreferences to Luther are made, and while any such influence would be\nmediated by other figures such as Schopenhauer, it is arguable that\nsome elements in Nietzsche\u2019s rejection of the idea of the free\nwill might be found in Luther, not with respect to Nietzsche\u2019s\ncausal determinism, but at the level of his doubts concerning the\npower of free choice to occupy a neutral position between the agent\nand their actions\u2014for example, in Nietzsche\u2019s well known\ncriticism of \u201cpopular morality\u201d which \n\n\nseparates strength from the manifestation of strength, as though there\nwere an indifferent substratum behind the strong which had the\nfreedom to manifest strength or not. (1887: First Essay,\n\u00a713) \n\n\nIn a somewhat similar way (see\n Luther entry \u00a74),\n Luther is critical of Erasmus\u2019s conception of the idea that\nthere is any \u201cpure will\u201d (purum velle) standing\nabove desire (studium) or striving (conatus) which can thus decide\nwhether to go one way or another (cf. WA 18:669/LW\n33:114\u20135).\n",
