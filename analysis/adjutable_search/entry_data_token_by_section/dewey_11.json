    "main_text": "Experience and Metaphysics || Dewey\u2019s Positive Account of Experience\n3.3 Dewey\u2019s Positive Account of Experience\n\nSo far, these details, and the section on psychology, limn an outline\nof Dewey\u2019s view: experience is processual, transactional,\nsocially mediated, and not categorically prefigured as\n\u201crational\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d. Here are three\nadditional, positive characterizations: first, experience as\nexperimental; second, experience as primary\n(\u201chad\u201d) vs. secondary (\u201cknown\u201d); and\nthird, experience as methodological for philosophy.\n\nFirst, experience exhibits a fundamentally experimental character.\nThis was impressed upon Dewey in a variety of his educational roles.\nChildren\u2019s experiences involve alternating phases: acting and\nbeing acted upon. Such phases become \u201cexperimental\u201d when\nagents consciously relate what is tried with what eventuates and\neventually understand which actions are significant for controlling\nfuture events. \u201cLearning\u201d is the name for the outcome of\nexperience as\n experimental.[11]\n\nSecond, as shown, Dewey did not think experience was primarily known\nor reflective; much is \u201cfelt\u201d or \u201chad\u201d. Dewey\ncalls such experience direct, primary, or had. Had experience\nis barely regulated or reflected upon, whereas other experience is\ncharacterized by \u201cknowing\u201d or mediation-by-reflection;\nDewey labels such experiences \u201cindirect\u201d,\n\u201csecondary\u201d, or \u201cknown\u201d. Known\nexperience abstracts away from had (or direct) experience in\npurposeful and selective ways; knowing isolates certain relations or\nconnections. Dewey\u2019s The Quest for Certainty provides a\ncogent description:\n\n\n[E]xperienced situations come about in two ways and are of two\ndistinct types. Some take place with only a minimum of regulation,\nwith little foresight, preparation and intent. Others occur because,\nin part, of the prior occurrence of intelligent action. Both kinds are\nhad; they are undergone, enjoyed or suffered. The first are\nnot known; they are not understood; they are dispensations of fortune\nor providence. The second have, as they are experienced, meanings that\npresent the funded outcome of operations that substitute definite\ncontinuity for experienced discontinuity and for the fragmentary\nquality due to isolation. (QC, LW4:\n 194)[12]\n\n\nDewey\u2019s had/known distinction is a way of describing existence\nwithout presupposing a dualism between appearance/reality. Much in\nexperience is unknown to us without being illusory or merely apparent;\nwe are not trapped in a cave full of illusions with only rational\ndialectic to yank us upwards. Rather, we engage and cope with a world\nwhich is not completely meaningful. We strive to make the world more\nmeaningful, but while some of the meanings devised assist in\nprediction and control of circumstances, others are simply\nenjoyed\u2014but that does not make them less real.\n\nThird, experience was also considered a \u201cmethod\u201d. This\nrequires some unpacking.\n\nDewey\u2019s distinction between experience \u201chad\u201d and\n\u201cknown\u201d was more than just a phenomenological observation;\nit was a metaphilosophical directive regarding how philosophy, itself,\nshould be done. For experience is not just \u201cstuff\u201d\npresented to or witnessed by consciousness; rather, experience is\nactivity, engagement with life. Philosophy, too, is a form of\nactivity\u2014which means that we need to do philosophy\ndifferently; we need pay attention to where and how we start; in this\nsense, experience is a\n method.[13]\n\nOne might sensibly ask, \n\n\nIf Dewey says that experience happens in both\nprimary (felt, had) and secondary (reflective, known) ways, why not\nstart with theory? Is that not experience, too? \n\n\nDewey\u2019s reply would be that while theory is one kind of\nexperiencing, it is not where we start; theory is an intermediate\nphase of inquiry. As we live our lives, we confront problems which\ninvoke the need for inquiry and, often, there is a need to devise a\ntool of explanation and amelioration. Theory is that tool, generated\nby these encounters; it does not come first. \u201cThe vine of\npendant theory\u201d, Dewey wrote, \u201cis attached at both ends to\nthe pillars of observed subject-matter\u201d (EN, LW1: 11;\nsee also 386).\n\nAs did James and Peirce before him, Dewey challenged not only the\ntheories of previous philosophers, but the assumptions informing their\nmethods. For generations, philosophers started their\nphilosophical examinations with various theoretical\nconceptions\u2014\u201csubstances\u201d, \u201cmind vs.\nbody\u201d, \u201cpleasure as natural aim\u201d, and so on. In his\nphilosophical work, Dewey criticized any number of these\npresuppositions, but here his point is metaphilosophical\u2014how\nthese conceptions enter into the practice of philosophy as\npresuppositions. Too often philosophy puts the (theoretical) cart\nbefore the (practical) horse. We simply cannot know\u2014and should\nnot assume\u2014which terms and theories are necessary for\nan analysis of a novel situation. Nevertheless, much philosophy has\nassumed such necessities. We may call this the assumption of a\n\u201ctheoretical starting point\u201d. It has produced endless\ndialectical exchanges; it has caricatured and hollowed out many\ncomplex and changeable subject matters. Overall, it has isolated\nphilosophy from a more thoroughgoing empiricism which could engage\nwith humanity\u2019s most important problems.\n\nDewey\u2019s suggestion of \u201cexperience as method\u201d method,\nthen, is both a warning and a positive recommendation. It warns\nphilosophers to recognize that while intellectual terms may\nseem \u201coriginal, primitive and simple\u201d they should\nbe understood as the historically and normatively situated\n\u201cproducts of discrimination and classification\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 386; see also 371\u2013372, 375).\n\u201cKnowing\u201d is not an activity standing somehow beyond\nexperience or nature; it is an activity with its own standpoint and\nqualitative character. Intellectual products come, then, from earlier\ninquiries, which possessed their own parameters and purposes.\nWhatever theory is eventually devised for a new\nsituation\u2014and Dewey is not against theory, to be very\nclear\u2014it must be checked against ordinary experience\n(EN, LW1: 26).\n\nDewey\u2019s proposed method\u2014the experiential starting\npoint\u2014is not just another philosophical \u201cmove\u201d, but\na radical attempt to philosophize from what Ortega y Gasset calls\n\u201cthe shaken confines of our own life\u201d and what Douglas\nBrowning calls \u201cbedrock\u201d (Ortega y Gasset 1957: 40;\nBrowning 1998:\n 74).[14]\n Dewey wrote,\n\n\nThe experiential or denotative method tells us that we must go behind\nthe refinements and elaborations of reflective experience to the gross\nand compulsory things of our doings, enjoyments and\nsufferings\u2014to the things that force us to labor, that satisfy\nneeds, that surprise us with beauty, that compel obedience under\npenalty. (EN, LW1: 375\u201376)\n\n\nSuch a method is truly critical, because it forces inquirers\nto check previous interpretations and judgments against their live\nencounters in a new situation (EN, LW1: 364). This entails\nthat philosophy as a practice impose upon itself a much more\nradical and dynamic model of theorizing, one pressed into much closer\ntransactions with existing practices and problems. This imposition, in\nturn, forces philosophy to engage with new subject matters (and\ntheories), beyond the traditional \u201cproblems of\nphilosophy\u201d, and to embrace the idea that \u201cthe starting\npoint is the actually problematic\u201d (EN, LW1:\n61).\n",
