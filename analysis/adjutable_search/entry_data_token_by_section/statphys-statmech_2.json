    "main_text": "Dynamical Systems\n3. Dynamical Systems\n\nBefore delving into the discussion of SM, some attention needs to be\npaid to the \u201cM\u201d in SM. The mechanical background theory\nagainst which SM is formulated can be either classical mechanics or\nquantum mechanics, resulting in either classical SM or quantum SM.\nFoundational debates are by and large conducted in the context of\nclassical SM. We follow this practice in the current entry, but we\nbriefly draw attention to problems and issues that occur when moving\nfrom a classical to a quantum framework\n (\u00a74.8).\n From the point of view of classical mechanics, the systems of\ninterest in SM have the structure of dynamical system, a\ntriple \\((X,\\) \\(\\phi,\\) \\(\\mu).\\) \\(X\\) is the state space of the\nsystem (and from a mathematical point of view is a set). In the case\nof a gas with \\(n\\) molecules this space has \\(6n\\) dimensions: three\ncoordinates specifying the position and three coordinates specifying\nthe momentum of each molecule. \\(\\phi\\) is the time evolution\nfunction, which specifies how a system\u2019s state changes over\ntime, and we write \\(\\phi_{t}(x)\\) to denote the state into which\n\\(x\\) evolves after time \\(t\\). If the dynamic of the system is\nspecified by an equation of motion like Newton\u2019s or\nHamilton\u2019s, then \\(\\phi\\) is the solution of that equation. If\nwe let time evolve, \\(\\phi_{t}(x)\\) draws a \u201cline\u201d in\n\\(X\\) that represents the time evolution of a system that was\ninitially in state \\(x\\); this \u201cline\u201d is called a\ntrajectory. Finally, \\(\\mu\\) is a measure on \\(X\\), roughly a\nmeans to say how large a part of \\(X\\) is. This is illustrated\nschematically in\n Figure 2.\n For a more extensive introductory discussion of dynamical systems see\nthe entry on\n the ergodic hierarchy, section on dynamical systems,\n and for mathematical discussions see, for instance, Arnold and Avez\n(1967 [1968]) and Katok and Hasselblatt (1995).\n\n\n\nFigure 2 [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIt is standard to assume that \\(\\phi\\) is deterministic, meaning, that\nevery state \\(x\\) has exactly one past and exactly one future, or, in\ngeometrical terms, that trajectories cannot intersect (for a\ndiscussion of determinism see Earman (1986)). The systems studied in\nBSM are such that the volume of \u201cblobs\u201d in the state space\nis conserved: if we follow the time evolution of a \u201cblob\u201d\nin state space, this blob can change its shape but not its volume.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, this amounts to saying that the\ndynamics is measure-preserving: \\(\\mu(A) = \\mu(\\phi_{t}(A))\\)\nfor all subsets \\(A\\) of \\(X\\) and for all times \\(t\\). Systems in SM\nare often assumed to be governed by Hamilton\u2019s equations of\nmotion, and it is a consequence of Liouville\u2019s theorem that the\ntime evolution of a Hamiltonian system is measure-preserving.\n",
