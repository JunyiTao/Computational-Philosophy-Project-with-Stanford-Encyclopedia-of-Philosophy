    "main_text": "Analogy\n4. Analogy\n\n\nAn analogical argument in legal reasoning is an argument that a case\nshould be treated in a certain way because that is the way a\nsimilar case has been treated. Arguments by analogy\ncomplement arguments from precedent in two ways: (i) they are used\nwhen the facts of a case do not fall within the ratio of any\nprecedent, in order to assimilate the result to that in the analogical\ncase; and (ii) they are used when the facts of a case do fall\nwithin the ratio of a precedent, as a basis for distinguishing the\ncase at hand from the precedent. The force of an argument\nfrom analogy is different to that from precedent. An indistinguishable\nprecedent must be followed unless the court has the power to overrule\nthe earlier decision and does so. By contrast, arguments from analogy\nvary in their strengths: from very \u2018close\u2019 analogies\n(which strongly support a result) to more \u2018remote\u2019\nanalogies (which weakly support a result).  Analogies do not bind:\nthey must be considered along with other reasons in order to reach a\nresult. That an analogy is rejected in one case does not preclude\nraising the analogy in a different case.\n\n\nAnalogies, like precedents, arise within a doctrinal context.  The\ncase at hand raises a legal issue, e.g. does the impersonation of a\nboyfriend vitiate the victim's consent in the law of rape, is\ncross-burning protected \u2018speech\u2019 within the First\nAmendment to the US Constitution, does the defence of duress require\nthe defendant to have acted as a reasonable person would have done?\nOther cases dealing with the validity of consent or the scope of\nprotected \u2018speech\u2019 or reasonableness in defences provide\npotential analogies. An analogy may either be to another case or to\nanother legal doctrine, and the analogy rests on there being some\ncommon characterisation of the facts in both cases or the two\ndoctrines which is relevant to the issue. So knives may be analogous\nto guns if the issue concerns weapons, but knives may also be\nanalogous to teaspoons if the issue concerns cutlery. Duress may be\nanalogous to provocation if the issue concerns defences, but duress\nmay also be analogous to incitement if the issue concerns\ncomplicity. Two doctrines or sets of facts are not analogous in the\nabstract, but in the context of a legal\n issue.[17]\n\n\nTwo questions arise about analogical reasoning. Firstly, by what\nprocess does a decision-maker identify the \u2018common\ncharacterisation\u2019 between the case at hand and the analogous\none?  Secondly, what type of justificatory force does the common\ncharacterisation provide?  On the first question, just as no two cases\nare identical in every respect, so no two cases are such that some\ncommon characterisation of the facts cannot be found. But not every\ncase is thought to provide an analogy, so what limits or directs the\nselection of analogies?  The answer to this question flows into the\nissue of the justificatory force of analogies.  What sort of reason\ndoes an analogy provide for deciding the instant case in the same\nway?\n\n\nIt is widely agreed that the existence of an analogy depends\nultimately upon the justification for the analogical\ndecision. The facts in a case may fall outside the ratio of\nan existing precedent, and thus the court is not bound by the\nprecedent. On the other hand the justification for the\nearlier decision may apply to the later case, and thus provide an\nargument from analogy. Take the case of the impersonation of a\nboyfriend in the law of rape. Assume that there is authority for the\nproposition that the impersonation of a husband vitiates consent for\nthe purposes of rape. Whether the impersonation of a boyfriend is\nanalogous depends upon why such a marital impersonation vitiates\nconsent. If it is thought that part of the significance of being\nmarried is the sharing of physical intimacy with that particular\nperson, then the rationale is applicable to other close personal\nrelationships. If instead the rationale is that consent to an\nimpersonator involves committing an act of adultery, i.e., an act\ndifferent in kind to that consented to, then although the two\nsituations are obviously very similar, the analogy will fail.\n\n\nIt is often argued that reasoning by analogy and distinguishing\nprecedents are mirror images of each other: given the facts of two\ncases, the question is whether there is a good reason for treating\nthem differently (e.g. Eisenberg 1988, 87). In the case of\ndistinguishing, a precedent must be followed unless there are good\nreasons for treating it differently. In the case of analogy, it is\nsaid, a precedent must be extended unless there are good reasons for\ntreating the instant case differently. But this is misleading, since\nthe symmetry is incomplete. A precedent cannot be distinguished on\ngrounds that would, in substance, imply that the precedent was wrongly\ndecided: it must be treated as correctly decided. A precedent need not\nbe extended, however, if later courts regard its rationale as\nunpersuasive. A longstanding doctrine of the common law was that a\nhusband could not commit the offence of rape against his wife. By the\ntwentieth century the rule was increasingly recognised to be archaic\nand objectionable.  Thus, unlike the question of impersonation discussed\nabove, no one suggested that the rule should be\nextended to cohabiting\n couples.[18] \n Where a decision is not regarded as misguided, however, it does\nprovide an argument for being followed. The later court may still\ndecide, however, that it would not be desirable, all things\nconsidered, to do so.\n\n\nThe explanation for the justificatory force of such resemblances is,\nhowever, controversial. There are two major alternative accounts, the\none relying on principles, the other on reasons.\n",
