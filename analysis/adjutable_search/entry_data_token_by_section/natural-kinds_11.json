    "main_text": "The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms\n4. The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms\n\nMuch recent interest in natural kinds has been stimulated by debates\nconcerning the semantics of natural kind terms, originating especially\nwith the work of Saul Kripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1973, 1975a).\nTypical natural kind expressions fall into one of two categories:\npredicates (is water, is gold, is a tiger,\nand is an oak) and singular terms (water,\ngold, the tiger, and the oak). In this\nsection we survey some of the debates concerning the meaning of such\nterms, what\u2014if anything\u2014they refer to, and how they do so.\nMany discussions focus on the predicate kind terms, often considering\nthem alongside other general terms, taking the principal issue to be\nthe relationship between a natural kind term and its extension. Such\nan approach will appeal to conventionalists, but it may appeal also to\nthose naturalists who are nominalists about natural kinds or otherwise\nhostile or indifferent to (strong) realism about natural kinds.\nHowever, we shall see that there may be reason to take the singular\nkind terms as primary. (One difference between Putnam and Kripke is\nthat while Putnam tends to focus on the natural kind predicates,\nKripke\u2019s arguments are centered primarily on the singular\nnatural kind terms.) Kripke and Putnam attacked a pair of related\nviews about natural kind terms: descriptivist semantics (the meaning\nof such a term is a description satisfied by all and only members of\nthe kind) and internalism (the meaning of such a term, the relevant\ndescription, is fully grasped by competent users of the term so that\nwhat fixes the extension of the term supervenes on what is internal to\nthe user). Putnam\u2019s rejection of descriptivism is a component of\nhis argument that \u2018meanings ain\u2019t in the head\u2019\nwhereas for Kripke the goal is to show that natural kind terms are\nmuch like proper names, for which, he argues, a descriptivist\nsemantics fails. Members of the extension of a natural kind share\nproperties in common. If descriptivism were true, then one would\nreasonably believe that those properties would be the properties\nmentioned in the description with the possible addition of further\nproperties nomically correlated with those. But if descriptivism is\nfalse, it would appear that the characteristic properties of a kind\nwill not typically be knowable a priori, but must be uncovered by\nscientific investigation. If so, then those properties, being\nnecessary conditions of kind membership but discoverable only a\nposteriori, look very much like real essences. At first sight\nit seems then that the semantic arguments of Kripke and Putnam have\nmetaphysical consequences. This is highly controversial (Salmon 1979,\n1982). Do the arguments of Putnam and Kripke really support an\nessentialist metaphysics? Or do they illegitimately assume it? Or do\nthey, more innocently, show that we as users of natural kind terms\nimplicitly assume such a metaphysics?\n",
