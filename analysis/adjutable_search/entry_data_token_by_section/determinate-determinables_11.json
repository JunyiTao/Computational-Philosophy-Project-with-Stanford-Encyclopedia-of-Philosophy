    "main_text": "Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates || Reductionist accounts\n3.4 Reductionist accounts\n\nReductionists take determinables to exist but to be reducible to\ndeterminates\u2014that is, to be identical to classes or broadly\nlogical constructions of (ultimately maximal) determinates.\n3.4.1 Disjunctive reductionism\n\nThe most common reductionist strategy takes determinables to be\nidentical to disjunctions of (ultimately maximal) determinates (see,\ne.g., Clapp 2001; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002; Antony\n 2003;[27]\n Massin 2013, and Dosanjh 2021). On this view, for example,\ncolor is identical to a disjunctive property having every\nmaximally specific color shade as a disjunct.\n\nDisjunctivism explains several features of determination:\nRequisite determination is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunction requires the instancing of a disjunct;\nDeterminable inheritance is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunct entails the instancing of any associated disjunctions\n(see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, Massin 2013); Causal\ncompatibility is accommodated via the identity of determinable\n(disjunctive) and determinate (disjunct) instances (see Clapp 2001).\nAnd while disjunctivism violates Non-disjunctive\nspecification, disjunctivists preserve some contrast by\nstipulating that determinables are a special sub-class of the class of\ndisjunctive properties\u2014ones having resembling determinates as\ndisjuncts (see Clapp 2001; Dosanjh 2021) or which are projectible in\nGoodman\u2019s (1983) sense (see Antony 2002). Other stipulations may\nbe required to accommodate Determinate incompatibility,\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables, and\nUnique determination.\n\nThree concerns face disjunctivist accounts, besides concerns that the\nrequired stipulations are unexplanatory, and that reality may not be\n(ultimately, entirely) maximally determinate. The first reflects\nreasons for rejecting disjunctive properties. One such\nreason\u2014namely, Armstrong\u2019s concern that \u201cdisjunctive\nproperties offend against the principle that a genuine property is\nidentical in its different particulars\u201d (1978a: 20)\u2014may be\nput aside if the disjuncts at issue are genuinely resembling, as\nproponents of disjunctivism suppose. This response will not, however,\nsatisfy those taking disjunctions to be mere logical constructions,\nwith no metaphysical import.\n\nThe second concern is that taking the disjuncts identified with\ndeterminates to be genuinely resembling, as is needed in order to\nanswer Armstrong\u2019s concern and to provide an alternative basis\nfor the contrast flagged in Non-disjunctive specification,\nwill open the door to looking for a source of the supposed\ncommonality, which source might well end up being an irreducible\ndeterminable. Here again the question of how best to treat the inexact\nresemblance between determinates is pressing.\n\nThe third concern is that a disjunctive account cannot accommodate\ncertain prima facie motivations for determinables as present in\nperception and thought. To start, if determinables are disjunctions of\nmaximal determinates, then every instance of a determinable is an\ninstance of a maximal determinate; but Sorites phenomena and our\nfailure to perceive micro-determinate shapes of macro-objects seem\nprecisely to indicate that some instances of determinables in\nperception are not maximally determinate. Relatedly (as above), Rosen\nsuggests that a disjunctivist approach imposes implausibly strong\nconditions on competence with determinable terms or concepts, contra a\ncase in which someone familiar with many shades of blue has no\nconception of cerulean (indeed, is perhaps even incapable of\nthinking of this shade), but where this deficit \u201cwould not\nprevent him from being competent with the word \u2018blue\u2019, or\nfrom knowing a great deal about the color blue\u201d (2010: 128).\n3.4.2 Relational accounts\n\nOn a relational account of the sort advocated by Bigelow and Pargetter\n(1990), what it is for determinates to fall under a common\ndeterminable is for the determinates to instantiate second-degree\nrelations of difference from one another, and for pairs of these\ndifferences to in turn instantiate third-degree proportions\n(58\u201362). Bigelow and Pargetter motivate a relational account as\nexplaining both why determinates are similar and why they differ.\nIrreducible determinables are insufficient unto this task, they\nmaintain, on grounds, first, that taking determinables to be\nirreducibly distinct from but necessarily accompanied by determinates\nintroduces unexplained necessary connections (1990: 118), and second,\nthat determinables alone don\u2019t explain differences between\ndeterminates (1990: 54, 58; see also Armstrong 1978b: 113).\n\nBesides the usual concerns with reductive accounts, two concerns\nattach to a relational account. The first is that attention to the way\nin which determinates differ doesn\u2019t in itself serve to\ncharacterize the way in which determinates resemble. As Elder puts\nit,\n\n\nalthough properties such as being blue or rich or stabbingly painful\ndo come in different degrees or intensities, there is more that is\ncommon to the various precise \u201cvalues\u201d of these properties\nthan just that they differ from one another in graduated ways. (1996:\n155)\n\n\nThe second is that, as Elder also observes, from the metaphysical\nirreducibility of determinables to determinates, it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that their necessary connection is mysterious: if\n\n\nthe various determinates [\u2026] each embodies the same property as\nthe others [\u2026] it is hard to see any great mystery in the fact\nthat possession of any one of these determinate shades necessarily\ngoes with possession of the relevant determinable. (1996: 157)\n\n\nAlso worth noting is that concerns about necessary connections\ntypically arise from acceptance of Hume\u2019s Dictum, according to\nwhich there are no metaphysically necessary connections between\ndistinct existences; but post-empiricist motivations for believing\nthis principle are unclear (see MacBride 2005 and Wilson 2010).\n3.5 Non-reductive accounts\n\nWe turn now to accounts on which determinables are taken to\nirreducibly exist. These accounts are typically implemented under the\nassumption that determinables are less fundamental than\u2014are\nmetaphysically posterior to\u2014determinates. In\n \u00a74\n we\u2019ll consider whether determinables may be as fundamental as\ndeterminates, and whether certain of the non-reductive accounts to\nfollow are compatible with fundamental as well as non-fundamental\ndeterminables.\n3.5.1 Essence-based accounts\n\nAsymmetric necessitation (i.e., Asymmetric modal dependence)\nhas been taken to be a neutral modal basis for theorizing about\ndetermination. As Yablo initially suggests:\n\n\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) just in case the traditional relation\u2019s\nfirst, metaphysical component is in place, where this consists\nprimarily in the fact that \\(P\\) necessitates \\(Q\\) asymmetrically.\n(1992: 253, note 23)\n\n\nSince reductionists also accept Asymmetric modal dependence,\na modal account requires supplementation if it is to be\nnon-reductive.\n\nYablo goes beyond asymmetric necessitation in considering how (token,\nparticular) events\u2014the assumed relata of the causal\nrelation\u2014might stand in the determination relation; his approach\nappeals to the notion of essence of an event, and to the idea that the\nessence of one such event might be included in or subsumed by the\nessence of another:\n\n\nDetermination involves the idea that the requirements associated with\none thing include the requirements associated with another; and\nalthough properties are requiremental on their face, particulars are\nnot. Hence the need for a notion of individual essence, where\nessential properties of a thing are those it cannot exist without.\n[T]he essence of a thing is supposed to be a measure of what is\nrequired in order to be that thing. Thus if more is required to be\n\\(y\\) than to be \\(x\\), this should be reflected in an inclusion\nrelation between their essences:\n\n\nWhen \\(q\\)\u2019s essence is a subset of \\(p\\)\u2019s essence, \\(p\\)\nis said to subsume \\(q\\) (\\(p \\geq q\\)); and \\(p\\) determines \\(q\\)\n(\\(p > q\\)) when the inclusion is strict. (1992: 261)\n\n\n\nGranting that essences exist and bracketing continuing controversy\nabout their nature (see, e.g., Robertson Ishii and Atkins 2020),\nYablo\u2019s approach characterizes determinable events (e.g., a\npatch\u2019s being coloured at a time) in properly non-reductive\nterms at both the type and token levels, and might be extended to a\nmore general non-reductive account of determinables, capable of\naccommodating the range of motivations for irreducible determinables.\nTaking determinable events to have essences contained within\nassociated determinate events would also clearly explain various\nfeatures of determination, including (besides Asymmetric modal\ndependence, which is presumably still in force), Determinable\ninheritance (constitutive objects of determinate events are also\nconstitutive objects of determinable events) and Determination\n\u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables (the essences\nof/requirements on determinates include but go beyond the essences\nof/requirements on their determinables). More needs to be said,\nhowever, if an appeal to essences is to explain other features of\ndetermination, including Non-conjunctive specification,\nRequisite determination, Determinate\nincompatibility, and\u2014importantly for Yablo\u2019s intended\napplication of determination to the problem of mental causation;\n see \u00a75.2\u2014Causal\n compatibility. The latter feature might be gained if the\nessences at issue are constituted by powers (see below), in which case\nan essence-based account might shade into a powers-based account, to\nbe next discussed.\n3.5.2 Causal and powers-based accounts\n\nCausal and powers-based accounts of determination are typically\nmotivated by the problem of mental/higher-level causation, expressed\nby the question: How can higher-level properties bring about effects,\nas they seem to do, given that the physical properties upon which\nthese higher-level properties depend are sufficient to cause these\neffects? As we\u2019ll see in\n \u00a75.2,\n different causal accounts provide different answers to this question.\nAn important choice point, which will be tracked here, concerns\nwhether determinable and determinate instances are taken to be\ntoken-identical.\n\nThough MacDonald and MacDonald (1986) don\u2019t officially offer an\naccount of determination, they were the first to see determination as\nuseful for addressing the threat of causal overdetermination.\nEffectively, they suggest that the relation between mental and\nphysical properties is analogous to determination: in both cases the\nproperties at issue are, they maintain, type-distinct but\ntoken-identical, thus avoiding problematic overdetermination while\npreserving type-level causal relevance. It is unclear, however,\nwhether taking determinables and determinates to be token-identical\ncan accommodate certain of the (e.g., perceptual) motivations for\nirreducible determinables; token-identity accounts are also subject to\nan extension of Horgan\u2019s (1989) \u2018problem of mental\nquausation\u2019 and the associated concern with reductive accounts\nof mental states, according to which, given that the causal relata are\nultimately located particulars (events, objects, property instances),\nthe efficacy of determinables qua determinable\u2014that is,\nqua distinctively unspecific\u2014requires that determinable\nand determinate tokens as well as types be distinct.\n\nAn explicitly causal account of determination is Fale\u2019s (1990)\naccount of \u2018determinable or generic\u2019 and\n\u2018specific\u2019 universals, on which the former have a proper\nsubset of the \u2018causal relations\u2019 of the latter:\n\n\nIf \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are specific universals and \\(G\\) is a\ndeterminable or generic universal under which they both fall, then the\ncausal relations between \\(G\\) and other universals are a subset of\nthe causal relations between \\(S\\) and other universals; and also a\nsubset of the causal relations between \\(S'\\) and other universals.\nFor \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) to be species of a common genus is for them to\nshare some subset of causal relations, which subset can itself\nconstitute the causal essence of a universal, such as \\(G\\). For \\(S\\)\nand \\(S'\\) to be distinct species is for this subset to be a proper\nsubset of the causal relations which characterize \\(S\\), and also of\nthe causal relations which characterize \\(S'\\): there must be some\ncausal relation which \\(S\\) has, but not \\(S'\\), and some causal\nrelation which \\(S'\\) has, but not \\(S\\). (1990: 175)\n\n\nA subset-of-causal-relations account of generic/determinable\nuniversals promisingly accommodates many features of determination,\nfor reasons similar to those attaching to powers-based accounts,\nbelow. It also ensures the metaphysical irreducibility of a\ngeneric/determinable type to any specific/determinate type, by the\nprinciple of the indiscernibility of identicals (if \\(G\\) has only a\nproper subset of causal relations of \\(S\\), \\(G\\) cannot be identified\nwith \\(S\\)); and if this proper subset relation is preserved at the\nlevel of tokens, it will also block token-identity. More needs to be\nsaid, however, if this account is to ensure accommodation of\nNon-disjunctive specification (and more generally, if it is\nto block the metaphysical reducibility of determinable types to\ncertain constructions of determinate types), since one might suggest\n(as a variation on the theme of Antony 2003) that disjunctive types,\nlike Fales\u2019s generic types, have (only) the causal relations in\nthe intersections of their disjunctions. Fales\u2019s account also\nfails to provide a clear basis for accommodating Non-conjunctive\nspecification, since as stated it is compatible with a given\ndeterminate/species\u2019 being conjunctively analyzable into (for\nexample) a genus and differentia, each associated with a proper subset\nof the powers of the species. Even so, Fales\u2019 account of\ndetermination is a clear precursor both of Yablo\u2019s (1992)\nessence-based\n account[28]\n and the powers-based account, to be next discussed.\n\nA powers-based account of determination may be seen as an application\nof a powers-based approach to the metaphysical dependence (a.k.a.\n\u2018realization\u2019) at issue in physicalism (see Wilson 1999).\nAs Wilson observes, powers serve as a properly metaphysical basis for\ncharacterizing realization (improving on supervenience-based and\nepistemic approaches to this notion, in particular); moreover, she\nargues, a variety of seemingly diverse non-reductive physicalist\naccounts, including Yablo\u2019s determination-based account, are\nsimilar in aiming to ensure that the powers of a realized property are\na proper subset of those of its realizing property (properties). Hence\nshe maintains:\n\n\nOne way to make [Yablo\u2019s] conjecture more plausible is to put\nthe point in terms of the causal powers of the properties involved.\n[\u2026] the reason why \u201cdeterminables and their determinates\nare not causal rivals\u201d is because it is plausible, in the case\nof determinables and determinates, that each causal power of the\ndeterminable is identical to a causal power of its determinate.\n[Moreover, and for example,] the property of being scarlet, which is a\ndeterminate of the property of being red, evidently has more causal\npowers than the property of being red. (1999: 47)\n\n\nThese considerations suggest the following first-pass powers-based\naccount of determination:\n\n\nPowers-based determination (first pass): Property \\(P\\)\ndetermines property \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty]\nproper subset of the powers associated with \\(P\\).\n\n\nOn this approach, a determinate is more specific than its determinable\n(as per Increased specificity) in being associated with a\nmore specific set of powers. Clarke (1999), Shoemaker (2001, 2007),\nand Clapp (2001) also take determination to be a case-in-point of a\nnon-reductive realization relation satisfying the proper subset\ncondition on powers, where the powers associated with a given\ndeterminable property are those in the intersection of the sets of\npowers associated with its determinates.\n\nA powers-based account of determination provides a basis for\ndistinguishing determinable and determinate instances, contra\nMacDonald and MacDonald (1986) and Ehring (1996); for on a\ntoken-identity approach, determinable instances would be associated\nwith more powers than are associated with their type\u2014but that\nwould be reason for denying that the instance was of the determinable\ntype (see Wilson 2011). Hence the proper subset relation between\npowers plausibly holds for determinable and determinate tokens as well\nas types. This consideration also pushes against taking determinable\ntypes to be metaphysically reducible to (identified with) disjunctive\nor other constructions from determinates, since such reductive\nstrategies entail that instances of determinables and determinates\n(and hence the respective sets of token powers) are token-identical.\nAs such, and in particular, a powers-based approach accommodates\nNon-disjunctive specification.\n\nProponents of powers-based accounts accommodate Non-conjunctive\nspecification in different ways. On Shoemaker\u2019s version of\na powers-based account of realization/determination,\nNon-conjunctive determination is stipulated:\n\n\nProperty \\(X\\) realizes property \\(Y\\) just in case the conditional\npowers bestowed by \\(Y\\) are a subset of the conditional powers\nbestowed by \\(X\\) (and \\(X\\) is not a conjunctive property having\n\\(Y\\) as a conjunct). (2001: 78).\n\n\nWilson (2009) rather accommodates Non-conjunctive\nspecification by requiring that the powers in the complement of\nthe sets associated with a determinate and any of its determinates,\nrespectively, do not themselves constitute a set associated with any\nproperty, as per her second-pass formulation:\n\n\nPowers-based determination (second pass): Property \\(P\\)\ndetermines property \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty]\nproper subset of the powers associated with \\(P\\), and the set of\npowers had by \\(P\\) but not by \\(Q\\) is not [in itself] associated\nwith any property.\n\n\nA powers-based account accommodates most other standard features of\ndetermination. Causal compatibility is accommodated, since\nevery power of a determinable instance is token-identical with a power\nof an associated determinate. Asymmetry,\nIrreflexivity, and Transitivity are inherited as\nfeatures of the proper subset relation between powers.\nDeterminable inheritance is accommodated in that in having a\ndeterminate property with an associated set of powers, an object will\nthereby have the determinables associated with proper subsets of the\ndeterminate\u2019s powers (assuming that properties are at least\ncontingently individuated by associated powers; see below for further\ndiscussion). Determination \u2018in respect of\u2019\ndeterminables and Determinate similarity/comparability\nare accommodated by determinates\u2019 sharing the powers of their\nassociated determinable but having further powers, where the powers of\nthe determinable constitute the respect in which determinables are\nsimilar, and powers had by determinates but not the determinable serve\nas a basis for ordering the determinates by degree of similarity\n(effectively: determinates sharing more powers will be more similar).\nAccommodation of Determinable similarity/orderability also\nprovides a basis for responding to concerns that we cannot make sense\nof irreducible determinables since we cannot \u2018get a grip\u2019\non the difference-makers of determinates\n (see \u00a73.2):\n on a powers-based view, the difference-makers are, comprehensibly,\nthe powers in the complement of determinate and determinable sets.\nThat said, more could be said about how the sharing of determinable\npowers makes sense of how these additional powers count as being\n\u2018in respect of\u2019 the determinable and its powers, and as\nproviding a basis for ordering by\n similarity.[29]\n It is also worth noting that a powers-based account does not itself\nensure the accommodation of either Requisite determination or\nUnique\n determination,[30]\n though these omissions may ultimately be a virtue\n (see \u00a75.3).\n\nA powers-based approach to determination faces two main concerns. One\nis that the view requires endorsement of a controversial \u201ccausal\ntheory\u201d of properties, on which properties are (following, e.g.,\nShoemaker 1980) essentially and exhaustively constituted by their\npowers; for if properties have non-causal quiddities (primitive\nidentities, which float modally free of powers), satisfaction of the\nproper subset condition on powers won\u2019t guarantee that\ndeterminables are completely metaphysically dependent on\n(\u2018nothing over and above\u2019; \u2018grounded in\u2019)\ndeterminates (see, e.g., Melnyk 2006: 141\u201343 and McLaughlin\n2007), since the status of the determinable\u2019s\n\u2018quiddity\u2019 is left untreated; nor will it explain\nDeterminable inheritance, since satisfaction of the condition\non powers is compatible with the absence of the determinable\nquiddities. Here it is worth noting that while certain proponents of a\npowers-based approach to determination (e.g., Clarke, Shoemaker,\nClapp) presuppose a causal theory of properties, such a commitment may\nbe dispensable: since non-causal quiddities are scientifically\ninaccessible and besides the point of solving the problem of\nhigher-level causation\n (see \u00a75.2),\n their presence or absence is irrelevant to the status of\ndetermination (and more generally, realization) as a relation between\nbroadly scientific properties (see Wilson 2011, 2021).\n\nA second concern with a powers-based approach is that, in applying\nonly to broadly scientific goings-on, it doesn\u2019t make sense of\ndetermination as holding between abstracta or other entities lacking\npowers. In response, a proponent of a powers-based account might try\nto extend the approach beyond specifically causal powers to one\ninvolving non-causal functional roles associated with, e.g., being a\nnumber (determinable), and being a prime number (determinate). This\nextension remains speculative, however; at present the account is not\nfully general.\n3.5.3 Constitutional accounts\n\nIt is natural to think of irreducible determinables as in some sense\nshared parts or constituents of determinates. Such a view would\nprovide a natural way of accommodating Determinate\nsimilarity, Determinable inheritance, and other\nfeatures. A powers-based account might be seen as taking determinables\nor associated powers to be constituent parts of determinates; here we\nconsider non-powers-based constitutional accounts.\n\nJohansson (2000, 2004) endorses a constitutive account of\ndeterminables\u2014more precisely, of \u2018maximal\u2019\ndeterminables (such as color, shape, and smell) located at the top of\na determination hierarchy\u2014taking Determinate similarity\nand Determinate gradability as its starting point. According\nto Johansson, it is characteristic of determinables and determinates\nthat \u201ctwo different determinates of the same determinable can\nalways be continuously connected\u201d (2000: 108), in a way\nproviding the basis for the gradeable resemblance of the determinates.\nConversely, he maintains, determinates under wholly different\ndeterminables are not connected in this fashion: \u201cNo\ncolor-determinate resembles more closely a shape-determinate or\nvolume-determinate than any other\u201d (2000: 108). This\n\u2018gap\u2019 between determinables acts as a criterion, whereby a\ndeterminable is posited if and only if there is such a gap\u2014hence\nit is that only maximal determinates exist, by lights of\nJohansson\u2019s criterion. In cases where a determinable is\nappropriately posited, the determinable is shared by its determinates\nand explains their similarity; for example, all color-determinates\nhave the determinable property color in common (Johansson\n2000: sec. 3). Johansson\u2019s view is a mixed\neliminativist/non-reductionist view, since he assumes that any\nnon-maximal determinables do not exist, but are merely \u201cman-made\nconstructions\u201d (2000: 113). Such a view might be challenged,\nhowever, since even in the absence of a \u2018comparability\ngap\u2019 between same-level determinates (e.g., yellow and\nred), one might still suppose that the difference between\nyellow and red is not a matter of convention.\nAnother concern with Johansson\u2019s account reflects that the mere\nposit of a shared determinable does not (as Bigelow and Pargetter\n[1990] and Massin [2013] have observed) in itself make sense of\ndeterminable differences, though the appeal to the \u2018continuous\nconnection\u2019 between determinates may be able to do work\nhere.\n\nWorley (1997) sketches a different sort of a constitution-based\naccount, as a way of supplementing Yablo\u2019s (1992) asymmetric\nnecessitation account. She illustrates with triangularity, analyzed as\ninvolving the constituent features associated with being a closed,\nthree sided plane figure, which features can vary in ways associated\nwith equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles, among others.\nWorley sees this as motivating an account of determination on which\n\u201cthe constituents of each determinable are proper subsets of the\nconstituents of each of their determinates\u201d, such that, e.g.,\nthe determinable triangular and the determinate\nequilateral triangular would share features such as\nthree-sided and closed plane figure, but the latter\nwould be additionally constituted by equilateral. As Worley\nobserves, this account accommodates various features of determination,\nincluding Determinable inheritance:\n\n\nThere can be no metaphysically possible world in which an instance of\na determinate can fail to be an instance of its determinable, since\nanything which is an instance of a determinate will be so in virtue of\nhaving certain features, which features will also be sufficient to\nmake that object an instance of the determinable. (1997: 290)\n\n\nThe shared constituent features also provide a basis for\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinates and\nDeterminate similarity/comparability, and perhaps the\nadditional features of the determinates can provide a basis for\nDeterminate incompatibility. The main concern with\nWorley\u2019s account is that it doesn\u2019t accommodate\nNon-conjunctive determination, and in fact seems to require\nits denial.\n3.5.4 Grounding-based accounts\n\n\u2018Grounding\u2019 (here capitalized to distinguish use of this\nterm from traditional schematic uses of \u2018grounding\u2019 as\nneutrally ranging over specific metaphysical dependence relations) is\na recently-introduced primitive relation or notion of metaphysical\ndependence, taken to be operative in any context where such dependence\nis at issue (either as holding between facts or propositions\npertaining to some goings-on, or between worldly goings-on\nthemselves). Proponents of Grounding typically take determination to\nbe a paradigm case of such dependence, with determinables being\nGrounded in determinates. For example, Correia suggests that\n\u201cthe determinate features of a thing\u201d are the Grounds of\n\u201cthe determinable features of a thing\u201d (2005:\n49\u201350); Schaffer (2016b) takes a case of determination as the\nprimary exemplar of his \u2018structural equations\u2019 approach to\nGrounding; and Rosen (2010) endorses the following principle:\n\n\nDeterminable-Determinate Link: If \\(G\\) is a determinate of\nthe determinable \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) is \\(G\\), then \\([Fa] \\leftarrow\n[Ga]\\)\n\n\nHere, \\([Fa] \\leftarrow [Ga]\\) stands for \u2018the fact that \\(Fa\\)\nis Grounded in the fact that \\(Ga\\)\u2019.\n\nThough Grounding is primitive, proponents stipulate that it has\nvarious features\u2014most commonly, those of a strict partial order,\nin which case a Grounding-based account of determination will satisfy\nAsymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\n Transitivity.[31]\n The also-common assumption that Grounding entities metaphysically\nnecessitate Grounded entities accommodates Determinable\ninheritance. How to accommodate other features (including\nNon-conjunctive specification, Non-disjunctive\nspecification, Determination \u2018in respect of\u2019\ndeterminables, and so on) is less clear, since Grounding\ndoesn\u2019t itself distinguish determination from other dependence\nrelations.\n\nCorrespondingly, the main concern with a Grounding-based account is\nthat primitive Grounding alone fails to shed any substantive light on\ndetermination, instead simply registering the common supposition that\ndeterminables metaphysically depend on determinates in a way\nconforming to certain stipulated formal features. This concern is a\ncase-in-point of the more general concern raised in Wilson (2014),\naccording to which Grounding is too abstract to shed any useful\nmetaphysical light on its own. Some proponents of Grounding attempt to\nprovide more substance to a Grounding-based account of determination\nby deriving or modeling the claim that determinables are Grounded in\ndeterminates, but whether these attempts succeed is unclear; see,\ne.g., Schaffer\u2019s (2016a,b) suggestion that determination can be\nmodeled using the apparatus of structural equations (\u00e0\nla Pearl 2000 and Spirtes and Scheines 1993), and reasons to\nresist that suggestion offered by Koslicki (2016) and Wilson\n(2016).\n3.6 Accounts of the structure or logic of determination\n\nWe now discuss three accounts or models which are best seen as\nelucidating certain structural or broadly logical features of\ndetermination or determinates.\n3.6.1 Property-space accounts\n\nA property-space model of the sort advanced in Funkhouser 2006 (see\nFunkhouser 2014 for further exposition) starts by filling in what it\nis to have a determinable \u201cin a specific way\u201d\n(Increased specificity) by attention to \u2018determination\ndimensions\u2019\u2014features along which a determinable may be\ndetermined, such as, e.g., hue, saturation, and\nbrightness in the case of color. The suggested\nmethodology for identifying determination dimensions of a given\ndeterminable is broadly empirical, and involves inquiring after\n\u201cthe ways in which determinates under the determinable \\(X\\) can\ndiffer from one another with regard to their \\(X\\)-ness\u201d (2006:\n551), which suggestion picks up on both Determination \u2018in\nrespect of\u2019 determinables and Determinate\nincompatibility.\n\nFunkhouser then offers a model on which determination dimensions,\nassumed to have discrete or continuous ranges of values, serve as\ncoordinate axes of a \u2018property space\u2019 for a given\ndeterminable. The space as a whole corresponds to the determinable;\npoints in the space correspond to maximal determinates, associated\nwith specific assignments of values to each determination dimension;\nsubspaces of the space correspond to less than maximal determinates\n(which themselves may be determinables relative to contained subspaces\nor points). For example, color has determination dimensions\nhue, saturation, and brightness, such that,\ne.g., red determines color if and only if the\nproperty space of red is a proper subspace of the property\nspace of color. More generally:\n\n\nProperty \\(B\\) determines property \\(A\\) iff\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) share the same determination dimensions\n\\(B\\) has the non-determinable necessities of \\(A\\) and\nThe property space of \\(B\\) is a proper subset of the property\nspace of \\(A\\).\n\n\n\n\u2018Non-determinable necessities\u2019 are those features of a\ndeterminable not allowing for variation (e.g., being three-sided, in\nthe case of triangularity); condition (2) registers that sharing of\nnon-determinable necessities is also required for determination, in\naddition to the increase in specificity associated with conditions (1)\nand (3), registering that determinates differ with respect to the\nvalues of one or more determination dimensions associated with the\ndeterminable.\n\nModeling determinates as subspaces of a determinable space\naccommodates many features of determination, including, to start,\nIncreased specificity, Determination in-respect-of\ndeterminables, Asymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\nTransitivity. Determinate incompatibility follows\nfrom subspaces\u2019 being disjoint; Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability may be elucidated by reference to\nmetrics on the spaces, whereby subspaces of a determinable space may\nbe nearer or further apart. Funkhouser also aims to accommodate\nCausal compatibility by taking determinable and determinate\ninstances (tropes) to be identical.\n\nWith this latter claim, Funkhouser\u2019s account moves into\nontological territory, and might be plausibly seen as a sophisticated\nvariation on a disjunctivist or other reductionist theme\u2014say,\none elucidating the internal dimensional structure of determinate\ndisjuncts vis-\u00e1-vis associated\n determinables.[32]\n As with reductive accounts, Funkhouser\u2019s assumptions that\nreality is ultimately maximally determinate and that determinable and\ndeterminate instances are token-identical might be challenged as\neither empirically inadequate or such as to not properly accommodate\nthe perceptual and other motivations for determinables. That said, it\nseems likely that the structural aspects of Funkhouser\u2019s\napproach could be preserved even if these assumptions are relaxed,\nsuch that, e.g., \u2018points\u2019 in a property space aren\u2019t\ntaken to correspond to maximal determinates (see note 46).\n3.6.2 Metric-space accounts\n\nThe metric-space account of\n\u201cdeterminables-together-with-their-determinates\u201d advanced\nby Denby (2001) \u201cidentifies abundant determinables and\ndeterminates with impure sets and the having relation with a\nset-theoretical relation\u201d (2001: 316). Determinables are defined\nas follows:\n\n\n\\(F\\) is a determinable iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle S, f\\rangle\\)\nwhere:\n\n\\(S\\) is a metric space; and\n\\(f\\) is a function from concrete particulars into the points of\nthis metric space.\n\n\n\nHere a determinable is thought of as a \u201cclassification\u201d of\nparticulars. The metric space \\(S\\) is a collection of points together\nwith a \u201cdistance\u201d relation on these points; it defines the\npossible classificatory locations and how they are related. Each point\ncorresponds to a determinate of that determinable, and the distance\nrelation provides a measure of the similarities among them. The\nfunction \\(f\\) maps each concrete particular in its domain to a unique\npoint in the metric space.\n\nDeterminates are defined as follows:\n\n\n\\(F\\) is a determinate iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle D, E_i\\rangle\\)\nwhere\n\n\\(D\\) is a determinable; and\n\\(E_i\\) is the extension of point \\(i\\) in the metric space\nencoded by \\(D\\).\n\n\n\nIn set-theoretic terms, a determinate is thought of as a\n\u201ccentered\u201d classification of particulars, defined by a\ndeterminable and by the determinate\u2019s extension. Denby moreover\nsees determinables as ultimately categorizing the possession of\nmaximal or \u201csparse\u201d\n determinates;[33]\n as such, he interprets his model along anti-realist or reductionist\nlines.\n\nThis approach to determinables and determinates is attractive, Denby\nargues, in that sets are ontologically unproblematic and their\nidentity-conditions and relations are well-understood (and similarly\nfor functions and metric spaces), and in that the account accommodates\n\u201cthe pre-theoretic intuitions about the logical relations among\nproperties\u201d (2001: 310), including Unique\n determination,[34]\nDeterminate\n similarity/comparability,[35]\n and Determinate incompatibility. The primary concerns here\nare again those associated with anti-realist or reductive views of\ndeterminables, though as with Funkhouser\u2019s account it might be\nthat the broad structure of Darby\u2019s metric conception of\ndeterminables is compatible with a non-reductivist reading.\n3.6.3 Co-determination accounts\n\nFine\u2019s aim in his 2011 is to characterize \u201cwhat it is for\nthe world to possess the kind of structure that it has when the\ndeterminate/determinable distinction is in play\u201d (2011: 162),\ntaking as inspiration Wittgenstein\u2019s post-Tractarian view, on\nwhich\n\n\nthe atomic propositions might exhibit the kind of dependence that is\ncharacteristic of the way in which different determinants of a given\ndeterminable are exclusive of one another. (2011: 161)\n\n\nFine\u2019s project reflects the usefulness of Determinate\nincompatibility for his truthmaker semantics (Fine\n2012a,b)\u2014most notably, in providing a non-similarity-based\naccount of the worlds entering into counterfactual deliberation, with\nthe general idea being that a counterfactual world will be just like\nthe actual world but for the replacement of some actual state \\(s\\)\nwith a state \\(s'\\) that is a determinate under the same determinable\nas \\(s\\). As such, Fine\u2019s ultimate aim is to provide a\ndefinition of the \u2018co-determinable\u2019 relation between\nstates\u2014a task which \u201cavoids the tricky question of saying\nwhat exactly a determinable is\u201d (2011: 184), though certain\nstructural characterizations of determinables fall out of his account.\nSince Fine\u2019s approach to characterizing determinable-determinate\nstructure is rather intricate, we direct the interested reader to the\nattached\n footnote.[36]\n4. Are determinates metaphysically prior to determinables?\n\nIt is commonly assumed that determinables, if they exist, are less\nfundamental than determinates. Of course, this assumption is true on\nreductionist\n accounts;[37]\n but even those taking determinables to be irreducible to determinates\noften suppose that the latter are prior to the former. In this section\nwe canvass reasons for and against taking determinates to be\nmetaphysically prior to determinables.\n4.1 Asymmetric necessitation/supervenience\n\nOne criterion of priority takes it to be sufficient for some goings-on\nto be less fundamental than some others that the former are\nasymmetrically necessitated by (or \u201cmetaphysically supervene\non\u201d) the latter. As per Asymmetric modal dependence, it\nis characteristic of determinates that they asymmetrically necessitate\ntheir associated determinables, thanks to the distinctively unspecific\nnature of determinables. Hence Armstrong says:\n\n\nA point to be taken very seriously is that because determinates entail\nthe corresponding determinable, the determinable supervenes on the\ndeterminates, and so, apparently, is not something more than the\ndeterminates. (1997: 50)\n\n\nAsymmetric necessitation appears to be insufficient for\nnon-fundamentality, however, as is reflected in standard concerns that\n(even asymmetric) supervenience is too weak to guarantee complete\nmetaphysical dependence (see, e.g., Horgan 1993, Wilson 2005, and\nMcLaughlin and Bennett\n 2005).[38]\n Nor is asymmetric necessitation necessary for the holding of a\npriority relation, as Fine\u2019s (1994) case of Socrates and the\nsingleton set of Socrates shows. As such, one can reasonably deny that\nthe asymmetric necessitation of determinables by determinates\nestablishes that determinables are less fundamental than\ndeterminates.\n\nEven accepting the criterion, one can question whether it shows that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. As French\n(2014) observes, while determinable instances do not entail any\nparticular determinate instances, there is nevertheless\n\u2018two-way\u2019 entailment: every determinate instance entails\ndeterminable instances, and every determinable instance entails some\ndeterminate instance. One might respond that the word\n\u2018some\u2019 expresses residual asymmetry in priority as opposed\nto simply reflecting that determinables are less specific than\ndeterminates, but as French notes, \u201cthose who exclude\ndeterminables from the fundamental base need to show what specificity\nhas to do with fundamentality\u201d (2014: 284).\n4.2 Naturalness\n\nAnother criterion takes more fundamental properties to be more\n\u2018natural\u2019, in the terminologically\n inapropos[39]\n meaning of Lewis (1983), in making for greater objective resemblance\nbetween their possessing particulars than do less fundamental\nproperties. This conception appears to deem determinables less\nfundamental than determinates: since determinables are less specific\nthan their associated determinates, particulars sharing a given\ndeterminate property (e.g., scarlet) will be more objectively\nsimilar in the relevant respect than will be particulars sharing an\nassociated determinable property (e.g., red). However,\nobjective resemblance can hold between properties as well as\nparticulars; hence even granting that determinates make for more\nobjective resemblance between particulars, one can reasonably maintain\nthat among the perfectly natural joints are those associated with\ndeterminables, understood as making for objective resemblance between\nassociated determinates (see Wilson\n 2012).[40]\n Such a consideration would support McDaniel\u2019s (2010)\nsupposition that the increase in specificity at issue in determination\ndiffers from that at issue in the disjunction-disjunct relation, in\nthat determinables, unlike disjunctions, are as natural as their\nspecifications.\n4.3 The argument from fixing\n\nAnother criterion of fundamentality, associated with intuitive\n\u201call God had to do\u201d scenarios, is one according to which\nfundamental entities fix all the rest. This criterion again seems to\nsupport taking determinates to be prior to determinables, for once the\nspecific, or determinate, facts are fixed, then, it seems, more\ngeneral/determinable facts are thereby fixed, with the latter being at\nbest ontologically real abstractions from the former. By way of\ncontrast, fixing the determinable facts does not fix the determinate\nfacts (as is reflected in Asymmetric modal dependence).\n\nThat determinable facts are fixed by determinate facts can be\nchallenged, however, by attention to the constitutive modal fact about\nany given determinable instance\u2014say, a given instance of\nred\u2014that it is of a type that might have been\ndifferently determined\u2014say, by scarlet rather than\nmaroon (see Wilson 2012). Here the suggestion is that no\ndeterminate fact or complex combination of such facts can provide a\nnon-gerrymandered basis for such a constitutive modal\n fact.[41]\n\nOne response is to maintain that a fundamental base need only ground\nthe contingent non-modal facts at a world, as Schaffer (2004: 90)\nsuggests; if so, then the failure of determinate instances to ground\ncertain modal facts about determinable instances won\u2019t impugn\nthe priority of determinates. One might maintain, however, that a\nsupposed \u201cground\u201d for some entity which failed to provide\na metaphysical basis for modal facts constitutive of the entity would\nbe incomplete, at best. As French puts it,\n\n\nfixing the non-modal facts and leaving modal flexibility out of the\npicture would yield an incomplete inventory. And the most obvious way\nof fixing the modal facts would be to include the determinables\nthemselves in the fundamental base. (2014: 284)\n\n\nThere is a worry that this line of thought will overgenerate, in that\nmany higher-level features and objects (e.g., tables) are to some\nextent constitutively modally flexible. A possible response is that\nwhether the line of thought applies to a given case will depend on\nwhether the basis for the modal flexibility is itself derivable from\nor otherwise clearly generated by lower-level goings-on. For example,\nmultiply realizable higher-level features (say, temperature in\nthermodynamic systems) whose modal flexibility results from the\nimposition of lower-level physical constraints would not be\nappropriately deemed fundamental (or as fundamental as their physical\nrealizers).\n4.4 Questions and implications\n\nThe previous considerations suggest that some determinable features of\nreality might be fundamental, or as fundamental as determinate\nfeatures. This result raises several questions, answers to which have\nimplications for our understanding of determinables and determinates,\nand of the fundamental.\n\nOne question pertains to whether the determinates associated with\nfundamental determinables are also part of the fundamental base. It\nmight seem so; for even granting that (fundamental) determinates\ncannot completely ground determinables, determinates seem also to be\nneeded to be existential witnesses for more specific goings-on. In\nthat case, a further question arises concerning how determinables and\ndeterminates jointly participate in a fundamental base. Wilson (2012)\nsuggests that a model for understanding such joint founding may be\nfound in the sciences, and more specifically in how general scientific\nlaws combine with initial or boundary conditions (15\u201316), an\nanalogy developed by French, who maintains that \u201cscientific\ndeterminables and determinates jointly enter into the fundamental base\nfor everything else\u201d (2014: 285). That said, there are arguably\nmetaphysical views on which only determinables are fundamental; for\nexample, Hubner and Matyasi (2020: 634) observe that Spinoza rejects\nthe view that determinates are among the fundamenta (insofar as the\none fundamental entity has only determinable features): \u201chis\nsubstance is both the least specific (indeterminate) and the most\nfundamental entity\u201d (e.g. Ep36; IV/185/29).\n\nA further question concerns whether existing non-reductionist accounts\nof determinables can make sense of these being fundamental. On the\nface of it, there is no special difficulty with accommodating\nfundamental determinables on either powers-based or constitution-base\naccounts of determination, or with such accounts\u2019 making sense\nof joint determinable/determinate founding. On Johansson\u2019s\n(2000) account, for example, it might be that determinates depend on\ndeterminables in that the latter are constitutive parts of the former\n(nota bene: not obeying weak supplementation), and\ndeterminables depend on determinates in that, modulo certain outside\ncase (e.g., gappy quantum indeterminacy;\n see \u00a75.3),\n determinable instances must be parts of some determinate whole.\n\nThat determinables and determinates may be jointly fundamental has\nimplications for our understandings of fundamentality and metaphysical\ndependence. Fundamental entities are commonly assumed to be\nindependent, in being wholly distinct, and (relatedly, as per\n\u2018Hume\u2019s Dictum\u2019) in being such that each can either\nexist together or exist apart. But if (some) determinables and\ndeterminates can be equally fundamental, this understanding is\nincorrect; for given the intimate relationship between determinables\nand determinates, to say that these are equally fundamental is\nevidently not to say either that they are wholly distinct or (even\ngranting Hume\u2019s Dictum) modally independent. Moreover, if\ndeterminables and determinates can mutually found each other, other\ncommonly stipulated suppositions are called into question\u2014e.g.,\nthat the fundamental entities are those that do not depend on any\nother entities, and that metaphysical dependence is asymmetric.\n\nThe possibility of fundamental determinables also bears on various\nfirst-order metaphysical topics. For example, Paul (2002, 2012)\nendorses a one-category ontology (\u2018mereological bundle\ntheory\u2019), on which properties and relations are fundamental, and\nproperty composition is \u201cthe fundamental glue\u201d (2012:\n242). Paul allows that determinables might be among the fundamental\nproperties and relations (note 22), and moreover suggests that such\nposits may be required to accommodate theories couched in terms of\nproperties and relations which are \u201cextremely abstractly\nspecified\u201d (2012: 245).\n5. Applications\n\nWe now canvass three topics in metaphysics where attention to\ndeterminables and determinates has played a significant\n role.[42]\n5.1 Laws of nature and nomological modality\n\nAs mentioned previously, determinables and determinates have been seen\nas relevant to our understanding of laws of nature in both physics and\nthe special sciences. Armstrong (1997) argues that irreducible\ndeterminables are needed to make sense of functionally specified laws\nin physics. Consider Newton\u2019s law of gravitation:\n\n\\[F = K (M_1 M_2)/D\\]\n\n\nAs Armstrong notes (see also Fales 1990: 61, Mellor 1998: 190, 208,\nand French 2014), substitution of the determinable quantities \\(F\\),\n\\(M\\), and \\(D\\) with determinate values gives rise to \u201ca law\nwhich stands as determinate to the original, determinable, law\u201d\n(1997: 63). One might try to provide an anti-realist or reductionist\ntreatment of these seemingly determinable laws. Armstrong (1997)\nargues, however, that such deflationary treatments cannot make sense\nof the role of functional laws in sustaining counterfactuals, at least\nif properties are Aristotelian universals, whose existence depends\nupon their being instantiated; for then there will typically (and\nperhaps necessarily, for the case of continuous quantities) be gaps in\nthe actual instantiations of functional laws. As such, the unity of\ndeterminates in these cases involves not just partial identities (as\ndiscussed in\n \u00a73.3)\n but \u201cstrictly identical second-order properties\u201d, which\nare the \u201creal [\u2026] determinables\u201d (1997: 247).\nMellor similarly maintains that in Newton\u2019s law, \u201cthe\ndeterminables ... are second order universals\u201d which exist along\nwith associated first-order determinate universals (1998: 209).\nFunctional laws of nature are then taken to be relations between these\ndeterminable universals.\n\nFrench offers a structuralist account of laws of nature as expressing\ndeterminable relations (a position Mellor also considers; 1998: 209).\nAs regards Newton\u2019s law, French says:\n\n\nIf we insert specific values [\u2026], we obtain a determinate\ninstance of the law, expressing the relation that holds between\ndeterminate properties. So, the law as a whole can be regarded as\nexpressing a determinable relation, which can be made determinate in\nspecific situations. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAgain, French allows that determinable laws/relations may be\nfundamental. Reflecting that one reason for taking (some)\ndeterminables to be fundamental is that these are partly constituted\nby modal facts pertaining to their possible determinations (see Wilson\n2012), French moreover suggests that the determinable nature of laws\nprovides a basis for physical modality:\n\n\nthese determinate instances correspond to solutions that can be\nrepresented by (more) specific models of the theory, and it is the\nshared structure between these models that yields the relevant\nphysical modality. The relationship between the more generic and more\nspecific models can be captured by that between determinables and\ndeterminates. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAnother application of determination to the metaphysics of laws\nconcerns whether these are contingent, in having at best a restricted\nphysical or nomological modality, or rather are metaphysically\nnecessary. Kistler (2005) argues that such laws are metaphysically\nnecessary, first arguing that the quantities in \u2018laws of\nassociation\u2019 such as the ideal gas law are reasonably seen as\ndifferent determinables of the same determinate states, such that such\nlaws are necessary; then generalizing on the base of systematicity\nconsiderations to other kinds of\n laws.[43]\n5.2 The problem of mental/higher-level causation\n\nHow can mental goings-on bring about physical effects, as they seem to\ndo, given that the physical realizers of mental goings-on are already\nsufficient to cause these effects? This question gives rise to the\nproblem of mental (more generally, higher-level) causation, encoding\ntwo threats: first, that mental properties, if efficacious,\nproblematically overdetermine their effects; second, that avoiding\noverdetermination requires that mental properties be causally excluded\nby their realizers. Overdetermination and exclusion are avoided if\nmental and physical goings-on are identical, but in that case it seems\nthat mental goings-on are not efficacious qua mental (see\nHorgan 1989); as Yablo puts it: \u201cMental events are effective,\nmaybe, but not by way of their mental properties\u201d (1992: 249).\nMoreover, type identity seems at odds with the multiple realizability\nof mental properties.\n\nSome, including MacDonald and MacDonald (1986), Yablo (1992), Wilson\n(1999), and Shoemaker (2001), have suggested that a better response\nproceeds by taking mental properties to be determinables of their\nphysical\n realizers.[44]\n The appeal to determination reflects various features of determinates\nand determinables, including Causal compatibility. As Yablo\nsays,\n\n\n[W]e know that [determinables and determinates] are not causal rivals.\n[\u2026] Determinables and their determinates, like objects and\ntheir parts, are guaranteed to be on the same team. (1992: 259)\n\n\nMoreover, as per Multiple determinates, determinables are\nmultiply determined, and given that determinables and determinates are\ntype- and perhaps also token-distinct, one can argue\n (see \u00a73.5)\n that determinables are distinctively efficacious. If mental\nproperties are determinables of physical realizers, these features are\ninherited: as causal non-competitors, overdetermination is avoided\nwhile accommodating multiple realizability, compatible with the\ndistinctness and distinctive efficacy of mental properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other higher-level goings-on, in which case\nrealization might be determination, more generally.\n\nA determinable-based approach to realization is subject to two main\nconcerns (besides those generally targeting a powers-based account;\n see \u00a73.5),\n each aiming to show that realization cannot be determination, on\ngrounds that realization lacks some key feature of determination (see\nEhring 1996; Funkhouser 2006, 2014; Walter 2007; Worley 1997). First\nis the argument from mental multiple realizability, according to which\nsuch realizability effectively violates Determination \u2018in\nrespect of\u2019 determinables (entailing that determinates\ndiffer in respect of determinables), since\n\n\nMental properties are said to be multiply realizable precisely because\ndistinct physical realizers can be exactly the same with respect to\nthe mental property they realize (Walter 2007: 219)\n\n\nin which case\n\n\n[T]he physical realizers of the mental will not differ mentally at\nall, as they should if they are determinates of the requisite mental\nstates. (Ehring 1996: 474)\n\n\nSecond is the argument from mental superdeterminates, according to\nwhich a mental property could be maximally specified qua\nmental\u2014as, e.g., a precise state of searing pain (Ehring), or a\nbelief maximally specified along the dimensions of content and\nconfidence (Funkhouser); but if realization is determination, this\nwould falsely imply that mental super-determinates could be further\ndetermined.\n\nOne response to these concerns, offered by Wilson (2009), proceeds by\nanalogical attention to color metamerism, in which colors of the same\nhue, saturation and brightness can differ in respect of color, and are\nmoreover reasonably taken to have physical determination dimensions.\nOne \u2018metameric moral\u2019 is that properties such as\ncolor may have physical determination dimensions; a second is\nthat the determination dimensions had by a given higher-level property\nmay be science-relative. Applying the morals: there is no in-principle\nproblem with mental properties\u2019 having physical determination\n dimensions;[45]\n moreover, which dimensions are associated with mental properties may\nbe science-relative. This allows accommodation of mental multiple\nrealizability: mental properties with diverse physical realizers can\nbe exactly alike, relative to the determination dimensions associated\nwith psychology, compatible with these mental properties being\ndifferent, relative to a lower-level physical science distinguishing\nthese realizers. And given that different sciences may treat a single\ndeterminable as having different determination dimensions, mental\nproperties may be super-determinate relative to a purely psychological\nscience, while being further determined relative to a lower-level\nscience.\n\nA powers-based implementation of the metameric\n morals[46]\n also provides a basis for a response to a third objection, due to\nWorley (1997), according to which the constituents of beliefs are not\nconstituents of their physical realizers, as they would have to be if\n(as per Worley\u2019s constitution-based account;\n see \u00a73.5)\n beliefs were determinables of physical\n determinates.[47]\n Supposing that constituents are associated with sets of powers, the\ncontent of a belief may be a constituent of its physical realizers,\nafter all\u2014not qua content per se, but\nqua the relevant subset of powers.\n5.3 Metaphysical indeterminacy\n\nMany phenomena appear to be indeterminate: macro-objects (clouds,\nmountains) appear to have imprecise boundaries; the future, it seems,\nmight be genuinely open; on many interpretations of quantum mechanics,\nsome properties of a system (e.g., position and momentum, orthogonal\nspin components) cannot jointly have precise values. In these and\nother cases there are reasons to think that the indeterminacy is\nmetaphysical, as opposed to merely semantic or epistemic. Elder (1996)\nsuggests that determinables might be useful for purposes of making\nsense of \u201cthe idea that corresponding to (at least some) vague\npredicates there really are, in the world, vague properties\u201d\n(1996: 150). Wilson (2013) more specifically argues that determinables\nand determinates provide the basis for an attractive account of\nmetaphysical indeterminacy\n (MI),[48]\n as follows:\n\n\nDeterminable-based MI: For a state of affairs to be\nmetaphysically indeterminate in a given respect \\(R\\) at a time \\(t\\)\nis for the state of affairs to constitutively involve an object\n(entity) \\(O\\) such that (i) \\(O\\) has a determinable property \\(P\\)\nat \\(t\\), and (ii) for some level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(P\\),\n\\(O\\) does not have a unique level-\\(L\\) determinate of \\(P\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\n\nOne application of Determinable-based MI is to macro-object\nboundary MI; here the conditions are satisfied in \u2018glutty\u2019\nfashion, reflecting that macro-objects typically have multiple\noverlapping realizers, as with Mount Everest and the multiple\noverlapping aggregates of rock in its vicinity at any given time. On\nthe suggested approach, Mount Everest has a determinable boundary\nproperty, but no unique determinate boundary property, since there are\ntoo many candidate determinates of the determinable, associated with\nthe comparatively precise boundaries of its realizing aggregates, to\nnon-arbitrarily pick out any one as the \u2018unique\u2019\ndeterminate boundary had by the mountain. At best, these determinate\nboundaries can be attributed to Mount Everest in relativized (or\ndegree-theoretic)\n fashion.[49]\n That ordinary objects typically have metaphysically indeterminate\nboundaries provides, in combination with a determinable-based account\nof realization\n see \u00a75.2,\n the basis for an argument that such objects are emergent\u2014that\nis, distinct from and distinctively efficacious as compared to the\nlower-level configurations upon which they cotemporally depend (see\nWilson 2021, Ch. 6). Another application is to open future MI: here\nthe conditions may be satisfied in \u2018gappy\u2019 fashion,\nreflecting that, while there might be present grounds for the future\ninstancing of a given determinable (say, being an outcome of a sea\nbattle) there may be no present grounds for the future instancing\nof any specific determinate of that determinable.\n\nDeterminable-based MI is also usefully applied to cases of\nvalue indeterminacy on (various interpretations of) quantum mechanics,\nassociated with superpositions, incompatible observables, and\nentangled states. Darby (2010) and Skow (2010) argue that metaphysical\nsupervaluationist accounts of MI (see Akiba 2004, Barnes 2010, and\nBarnes and Williams 2011) cannot accommodate quantum MI on the\northodox interpretation, for on these accounts MI is effectively a\nmatter of primitive unsettledness about which maximally precise world\nor state of affairs obtains; but such an approach cannot model quantum\nMI, since the Kochen-Specker theorem rules out simultaneously\nassigning definite values to all properties of a quantum system.\nCalosi and Wilson (2019 and forthcoming) defend this result against\ncertain objections, and extend the concern with supervaluationist\naccounts to cases of MI on the GRW and Everettian interpretations,\nassociated with GRW\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 problem (see Lewis\n2016) and ineradicable incompatible observable MI within Everettian\nbranches (see A. Wilson 2020), respectively.\n\nBy way of contrast, Determinable-based MI is compatible with\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem, and more generally, with insuperable or\n(as Skow puts it) any \u2018deep\u2019 quantum MI associated with\nquantum phenomena. Whether individual such cases are best treated in\ngappy or glutty determinable-based terms remains controversial.\nBokulich (2014) and Wolff (2015) see a gappy implementation as most\npromising for the target case of spin value indeterminacy; as Wolff\nobserves:\n\n\nPermitting the instantiation of determinables without determinates\nhelps to describe this phenomenon, because we can say that \\(x\\)-spin\nand \\(y\\)-spin are determinables with two determinates each, and\n[after a spin-\\(z\\) measurement] neither of these determinates is\ninstantiated even though the determinables \u201cspin-\\(x\\)\u201d\nand \u201cspin-\\(y\\)\u201d are. (2015:\n 385)[50]\n\n\n(See also Schroeren 2021.) However, a glutty implementation has\ncertain advantages, including being able to preserve information\nassociated with coefficients of components states in a superposition.\nCalosi and Wilson (2021) advance a glutty implementation as providing\nthe basis for an intelligible explanation of the distinctive\ninterference patterns characteristic of the double-slit experiment,\nreflecting that a single particle in the experiment can (in\nrelativized or degree-theoretic fashion) go through both slits in such\na way as to be able to interfere with itself (as per Dirac\u2019s\noriginal suggestion).\n\nThat said, whether the value indeterminacy on (available readings of)\navailable interpretations of quantum mechanics should be understood in\nmetaphysical terms, and if so, whether it should be treated in\ndeterminable-based terms (or relatedly, whether a supervaluationist\napproach can be fixed up so as to do the job), remains an area of\nactive\n research.[51]\n The debate continues; still, here and in other cases of seeming MI\nthere is a case to be made that our experiential and theoretical\nfamiliarity with determinables goes at least some distance towards\nrendering MI intelligible\u2014offering, along the way, a nice\ncase-in-point of how determinables may be useful for purposes of\nilluminating the structure of natural reality.",
