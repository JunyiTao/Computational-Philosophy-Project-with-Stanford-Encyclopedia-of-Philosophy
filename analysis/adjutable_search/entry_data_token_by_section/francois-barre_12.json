    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes || The demand for equality\n5. Poulain and His Successors\n\nPoulain\u2019s feminist treatises did not have a large following in\nFrance, but neither were they without impact. There were some\nauthorized as well as unauthorized re-editions (for a complete list\nsee Alcover 1981; also Welch 2002a: 25\u201331), but the references\nto his works are scarce. One exception is Gabri\u00e8le Suchon, who\nmentions \u201cthe author of the Equality\u201d in her\nTrait\u00e9 de la morale et de la politique [Treatise on ethics and politics] (1693), where she defends women\u2019s liberty as well as capacity of learning (Welch 2002a: 29; Shapiro 2017; Wilkin 2019). In the next\ncentury Louise Dupin cites Poulain in her unfinished manuscript Ouvrage\nsur les femmes [Work on Women] (ca. 1745), and we have direct evidence that Montesquieu spoke highly of De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 (Thielemann 1983: 321\u2013326;\nStuurman 2004: 283\u2013289; Wilkin 2019). It is also very likely\nthat Rousseau, who was working as Dupin\u2019s secretary while she\nworked on her manuscript, was familiar with at least Poulain\u2019s\nfirst treatise.\n\nAlready in 1677, De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 was\nanonymously published in English translation under the name The\nWoman as Good as the Man and Poulain\u2019s thoughts, if not his\nname, seems to have influenced English discussions of the equality of\nthe sexes well into the eighteenth century (Leduc 2010; Clarke 2013:\n12\u201313). One important mediator was the treatise Woman Not\nInferior to Man: or, A short and modest Vindication of the natural\nRight of the FAIR-SEX to a perfect Equality of Power, Dignity, and\nEsteem, with the Men (1739), published under the pseudonym\n\u201cSophia, A Person of Quality\u201d. This treatise, which has\nonly recently received attention from scholars, appropriated several\npassages from Poulain\u2019s treatise and radicalized his claims into\nan even more explicit demand for the rights of women (Clarke 2013:\n43\u201344; Broad 2019). We do not yet know enough about the\nreception history of Sophia\u2019s treatise, or about\nWollstonecraft\u2019s use of sources, in order to be able to even\nguess if there was a direct influence between the two vindications of\nthe rights of women, but Broad has recently shown that we can detect a\ncontinuity in the topic of dignity as the foundation for women\u2019s\nrights that stretches from Poulain to Wollstonecraft (Broad 2019).\n\nWhen we consider Poulain\u2019s influence in France during the\neighteenth century, we must take into account that the idea of\nequality based on the similarity of the sexes was much more contested\nthan in England. In \u00c9mile (1762), Rousseau famously\nclaims: \n\n\nhow vain are disputes as to whether one of the two sexes is superior\nor whether they are equal\u2014as though each, in fulfilling\nnature\u2019s ends according to its own particular purpose were\nthereby less perfect than if it resembled the other more!. (1762\n[1979: 358]; 2012: 825) \n\n\nRousseau argued that the sexes are neither equal nor unequal, they are\ndifferent, and should aim at perfecting their differences in order to\nform a harmonious couple. Poulain\u2019s demand for equality based on similarity was something to be argued against rather than adopted. Though\nRousseau\u2019s views on the relations between the sexes were heavily\ncriticized by English feminists such as Wollstonecraft (Reuter 2014),\nthey influenced many French feminists (Berg\u00e8s 2016). When\nOlympe de Gouges declares the rights of women during the French\nRevolution, she does not appeal to the similarity of the sexes, but to\ntheir harmonious union, which is fulfilled by all other animals except\nhumans. In her famous Les droits de la femme. A La Reine [The\nrights of women. To the Queen] (1791), she writes, addressing\ntyrannical men, \n\n\ndistinguish, if you can, between the sexes in the workings of nature.\nEverywhere you will find them intermixed; everywhere they cooperate in\nthis immortal masterpiece with a harmonious togetherness. (1791 [2011:\n30]; 1993: 206) \n\n\nWe do hear an echo from the golden age of liberty, but it is an echo\nformed by Rousseau\u2019s emphasis on the harmonious union of the\nsexes.\n\nDuring the early decades of the twentieth century there was a new\ninterest in what was seen as the history of feminist thought,\nactualized by the hotly debated question of women suffrage, and this\nresulted in some early scholarly essays on Poulain (Grappin 1913,\n1914; Lefevre 1914). In 1949 Simone de Beauvoir made Poulain\u2019s\nname known when she (rather freely) cites his phrase \u201cone should\nbe suspicious of everything that men have said about women because\nthey are both judges and litigants\u201d (T1en 151; TTfr 93) as a\nmotto for her Le deuxi\u00e8me sexe [The second sex].\nPoulain is more than a motto for Beauvoir and when discussing facts\nand myths about women, she describes his analysis in the following\nwords:\n\n\n[Poulain] thinks that since men are stronger, they favor their sex and\nwomen accept this dependence out of custom. They never had their\nchances: in either freedom or education. Thus they cannot be judged by\nwhat they did in the past. Nothing indicates their inferiority to men.\nAnatomy reveals differences, but none of them constitutes a privilege\nfor the male. (Beauvoir 1949/1989: 184\u2013185 [2011: 123\u2013124])\n\n\nIn addition to being an excellent summary of Poulain\u2019s argument,\nthis passage is an interesting key to Beauvoir\u2019s own analysis of\nhow women become the second sex (see also Welch 2002a: 32; on\nCartesian aspects of Beauvoir\u2019s thought, see Hein\u00e4maa\n2005).\n",
