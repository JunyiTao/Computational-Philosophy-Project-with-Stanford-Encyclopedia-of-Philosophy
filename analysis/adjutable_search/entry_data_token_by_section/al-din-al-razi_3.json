    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n4. Metaphysics\n\nJust as \u201csubstance\u201d (ousia) may rightfully be\ncalled the central notion of Aristotelian metaphysics, so is\n\u201cexistence\u201d (wuj\u016bd) the core notion of\nAvicennan metaphysics. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics is a\nstudy of the relationship between different kinds of things and the\nmode of their existence, which ultimately results in identifying a\nspecial, necessary mode of existence, which belongs to one being\nalone, namely God (see, e.g., Bertolacci 2016). There are two core\ndoctrines of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics, both widely\ndiscussed after him in the Islamic world, and both addressed by Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn in detail: the distinction between essence and existence,\nand the idea that God is sheer existence, necessary in all\nrespects.\n\n\u201cExistence\u201d refers for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 to the very fact\nthat things are, irrespective of what they are. For instance, it is\none thing for a red apple to be a red apple, and it is a completely\ndifferent thing for the red apple to be. To establish the\ndistinction between what things are (that is, their essence), and\nwhether they are (that is, their existence), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 uses\nan argument from conceivability. We can conceive of a red apple\nwithout knowing whether it exists, hence its existence must be\ndifferent from its essence (I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t,\nnama\u1e6d 4, 266). But how should we understand this\ndistinction between essence and existence? In the post-Avicennan\ntradition, there are two main answers to this question: the\ndistinction between essence and existence is real\n(\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b) or it is merely conceptual\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r\u012b). The first answer requires that\nthere are two different items outside the mind, which together make up\nthe existent red apple. The second response means that there is just\none item in the extramental world, the existent red apple; but we can\nanalyse it conceptually into \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cred\napple\u201d (Wisnovsky 2012, Eichner 2011b).\n\nWithin this debate, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to take the realist stance\nthat essence and existence are distinct outside the mind (Benevich\n2017). For instance, he feels compelled to address one of the most\npressing issues for the realists. If essence and existence are\ndistinct in reality, does this mean that all essences are already\nsomehow out there before existence attaches to them? Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nis not puzzled by that difficulty:\n\n\nThe essence as such (min \u1e2bay\u1e6fu hiya hiya) is an\nessence distinct from existence and non-existence. This does not imply\nthe subsistence of something existent in something non-existent\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 88).\n\n\nThe essence of the red apple as such (min \u1e25aythu hiya\nhiya) is indeed prior to its existence. The essences of things,\nconsidered as such, are in a different, third state of being, neither\nexistent nor non-existent (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith, vol.1, 129).\nOf course, this does not mean that there are essences of red apples\nhanging around before they even become existent. Just like Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, Fakhr al-D\u012bn accepts that essence and existence\nare extensionally identical: all instances of essence are also\ninstances of existence (Wisnovsky 2012). But Fakhr al-D\u012bn offers\na realist take on the Avicennan distinction by introducing a clear\npriority of essence over existence; more recent interpreters disagree\nas to whether this is faithful to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own\nmetaphysics (Bertolacci 2012, Benevich 2019b, Janos 2020).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn consistently uses his theory of the priority of\nessence over existence to discuss what Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 considered a\nspecial case, God. In Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s understanding, for Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, God\u2019s essence is just identical to His\nexistence. For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, this would be the only way to\nguarantee that God exists necessarily. For, if there were any\ncomposition at all of A and B, A could fail\nto be B, and B could fail to attach to A;\nsome further cause would be needed to guarantee the connection between\nthe two. Thus, the only way to secure that A is necessarily\nB is just to say that A is B. That would\nmean that God\u2019s essence is not even conceptually distinct from\nGod\u2019s existence. There is an obvious problem with this doctrine,\nhowever. If God\u2019s essence is sheer existence, but existence also\nbelongs to, for example, a red apple, how is the existence of the red\napple different from the divine essence? Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nreply depends on the notion of the analogy or modulation\n(task\u012bk) of existence, whereby one kind of existence\nbelongs to the red apple and another kind belongs to\u2014or rather,\njust is\u2014God (Treiger 2012, De Haan 2015, Druart 2014,\nZamboni 2020, Janos 2021). But Fakhr al-D\u012bn, again much like Duns\nScotus almost a century later, refuses to take this route. Instead, he\ninsists on the univocity of existence. Everything that exists, does so\nin the same manner of existence. Thus Fakhr al-D\u012bn is also\ncompelled to deny the identity of essence and existence in God\u2019s\ncase. God\u2019s existence will still be necessary, because His\nessence is such that it implies its own existence. So in God essence\nis prior to existence. This priority should not bother or indeed\nsurprise us, since we just have learned that all essences are\nprior to their existence. The upshot is that what is special about God\nis His essence, not a unique kind of existence\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 67; see further Mayer 2003,\nBenevich 2020a).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s contribution to history of metaphysics\nrecalls not only Duns Scotus but also Thomas Aquinas. Like Aquinas, he\noffers a taxonomy of proofs for God\u2019s existence, which becomes\nstandard in philosophy of the Islamic world after him. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn distinguishes between four mains proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence available to him at his time: from the contingency of\nessences; from the temporal origination (\u1e25ud\u016bth)\nof essences; from the contingency of attributes; and from the temporal\norigination of attributes. The first argument may be easily identified\nwith Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof for God\u2019s existence, which\nestablishes the existence of the Necessary Being by reasoning from the\ncontingency of all beings in the world (Marmura 1980; Mayer 2001;\nZarepour 2022). The second argument is the kal\u0101m\ncosmological argument. It argues for the existence of a Creator based\non the fact that the world came to be at some point. The third\nargument, from the contingency of attributes, alludes to the fact that\neverything in the world exists in a certain way, while it could have\neasily been some other way. Therefore, there needs to be some agent\nthat determined how things would exist. Finally, the fourth argument\ncomes closest to what we would designate as a design argument. The\nattributes of things in the world are not just one way when they could\nhave been different, but are in the best way possible. Hence, there\nmust be a wise agent who chose these marvelous features for the world.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn contends that the first argument, that is, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s argument for the existence of a Necessary Being\nis more fundamental than all other arguments\n(Ma\u02bf\u0101lim, 42).\n\nSo, while disagreeing with Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 whether God\u2019s\nessence and existence are identical, Fakhr al-D\u012bn does accept\nthat God is a Necessary Being. Still, probably due to his\nkal\u0101m allegiances, he is not ready to accept that God is\na necessary being in all respects. For instance, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s God cannot know particular individuals.\nKnowledge of what is happening right now while you are reading this\narticle would involve a change in God, since He would need to stop\nknowing that you are reading this sentence as soon as you move on to\nthe next one. But if God changes, then He is not necessary in all\nrespects, since necessity implies immutability. So the only way for\nGod to know what happens in the world is to conceive of universal\nrules, laws of nature, and causation, without knowing which of those\nrules are being at work right now (Marmura 2005, Adamson 2005; cf.\nAcar 2004 and Nusseibeh 2009). Following Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects this line of\nreasoning, on the grounds that change in God\u2019s knowledge is\nmerely relational (Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 198). Imagine\nthat you are standing still and something passes by you from right to\nleft; in such a case you do not change, but your relation to that\nmoving thing does change. Now, we need to imagine the same with\nrespect to God\u2019s knowledge the chain of events: it passes by God\nand God observes it, without God essentially changing.\n\nThis account of divine knowledge requires a very specific\nunderstanding of knowledge and cognition. Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, again following Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, defines cognition as a relational state\n(\u1e25\u0101la i\u1e0d\u0101fiyya). Fahr al-D\u012bn\nopposes this theory to the representationalist theory of cognition,\ncommonly ascribed to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 at this time:\n\n\nPerception does not just come down to the making of an impression. The\ntruth is rather that it is a relational connective state. For we know\nself-evidently that we have seen Zayd, given that our visual capacity\nfaculty has a certain relation to him. Anyone who claims that the\nobject seen is not Zayd, who exists extramentally and is not seen at\nall, and that the object seen is rather his representation\n(mi\u1e6f\u0101l) and likeness\n(\u0161aba\u1e25), has put into doubt the most important\nand powerful items of necessary knowledge (\u0160ar\u1e25\nal-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t vol.2, 233).\n\n\nAccording to representationalism, cognition involves the inherence of\nthe cognized object in the object of cognition. For instance, when I\nthink of a red apple, the idea of a red apple must be\n\u201cimprinted\u201d in my mind. For Fakhr al-D\u012bn, cognition\nis a direct relation between the agent of cognition and the object of\ncognition itself, that is, the red apple in itself.\nRepresentations\u2014if there are any\u2014are not the objects of\ncognition (Benevich 2019a, 2020b; Griffel 2021: 341\u201384).\n\nOne may wonder how this theory could explain the cognition of\nnon-existent objects. To what does my mind relate when I think of a\nphoenix, or of a square circle? Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 introduced the\nnotion of mental existence in response to this kind of question. The\nphoenix may fail to be existent outside the mind, but it\nexists in my mind while I am thinking about it, again being imprinted\nin my mind (Black 1997). Just as Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects the\nrepresentationalist theory of cognition, he consistently rejects the\nAvicennan notion of mental existence (wuj\u016bd\ndhihn\u012b). For him, when I think of non-existent beings, I\njust think of elements that constitute those beings and are observable\nin the world. For instance, thinking of a square circle means thinking\nof a square and a circle as if they were combined (Benevich 2018; on\nthe related issue of the \u201cparadox of the unknown\u201d see\nLameer 2014).\n\nWith this relational theory of cognition in hand, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is\nable to resolve the puzzle of how God knows about changing things.\nObjects of cognition are external to the agent of cognition, so that\nchange in those objects and the subsequent change in the process of\ncognition does not involve any change in the agent. Thus we can say\nthat God is a necessary being, but not necessary in all respects,\nsince His relational cognition of current events is constantly in the\nprocess of change. Yet this implies no change in God\u2019s essence.\nMoreover, we have seen above that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 suggests that God\nhas knowledge of universal rules of causation and natural laws. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn argues that precisely this kind of knowledge that Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 ascribes to God, that is, the knowledge of universal\nrules and causation, results in knowing every single event in the\nworld at the time when it happens (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.3,\n163\u201364).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s reasoning here presupposes a strictly\ndeterminist account of the world. There is a causal explanation for\neach event, and God knows it. And indeed, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is willing\nto embrace determinism fully. For instance, with respect to human\nactions, he argues that they are determined by the combination of our\nmotivations, beliefs, and capacities. We do not have control over any\nof these (as we saw in Section 1, Fakhr al-D\u012bn insists that our\nbeliefs are not up to us); so we do not have any control over our\nactions either (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.9, 35\u201343).\nThere are two important premises underlying Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\ndeterminism, both borrowed from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. One is that there\nmust be, for everything that exists but could have failed to exist,\nsome reason why it exists; this is said to \u201cpreponderate\u201d\nthe thing to exist rather than not existing. Second, when that reason\nis present, the phenomenon must inevitably happen. Therefore, in the\npresence of our capacities and motivations, we have no choice but to\nact, and do so necessarily (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.9,\n21\u201323; Mab\u0101\u1e25ith, vol.2, 517; on\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s theory of action see further Shihadeh\n2006).\n",
