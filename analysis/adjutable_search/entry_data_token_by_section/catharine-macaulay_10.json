    "main_text": "Thoughts on progress, liberty and education || Freedom of the will\n5.1 Freedom of the will\n\nThose who have published commentaries on Macaulay\u2019s views on freedom\nof the will are divided over exactly how the doctrine she develops\nfits into standard categories. Martina Reuter has argued that what\nMacaulay offers is a version of rationalist compatibilism, while\nothers have presumed that she is a hard determinist or modern\nCalvinist (Reuter 2007; Hilton 2007, 67\u201372; O\u2019Brien 2009, 168;\nGreen and Weekes,2013). Part of the difficulty of understanding\nMacaulay\u2019s position stems from the fact that she writes in opposition\nto those who make free choice arbitrary, and so concentrates on\nestablishing that choices are caused by motives, thus seeming to be\ncommitted to compatibilism, as is Hobbes, and yet she also wants to\naccept, with Plato and the Stoics, that we are only truly free when\nour acts are caused by reason, rather than by ill-conceived passion.\nShe understands individual moral progress as involving the\nstrengthening of reason, so that it can guide the passions, and lead\nthe individual to virtue. Political progress is intertwined with this\nindividual progress. Political structures compatible with the\nrationally perceptible moral law would be upheld were people virtuous,\nso education for virtue becomes a necessary means for effecting\npolitical progress, yet at the same time, the effects of faulty\nconstitutions militate against the capacity of people to attain\nvirtue, since in circumstances of excessive inequality, or where\ncorruption is endemic, both the poor and the rich are subject to\noverwhelming temptations to vice.\n\nAccording to Macaulay the necessitarian takes freedom to reside\nin,\n\n\n\u2026 those distinctions which the mind frames on the essential\ndifference which lies in those objects which present themselves to her\nperception, and which form the objects of her volition: else why have\nschools to train our youth in knowledge and in habits of virtue?\n(Macaulay 1783, 194)\n\n\nSo education is necessary in order to help people distinguish the\nessential differences between things, but she argues that it is also\nnecessary in order to counter the development of unhelpful\nassociations, and to train the mind to curb its passions, for Macaulay\nis heavily influenced by the associationist psychology of Edward\nHartley, Joseph Priestley and Jonathan Edwards. These metaphysical and\npsychological views inform her Letters on Education.\n",
