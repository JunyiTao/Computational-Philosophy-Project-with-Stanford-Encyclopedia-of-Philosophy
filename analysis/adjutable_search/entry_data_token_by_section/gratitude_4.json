    "main_text": "The Elements of the Grateful Response || Affective Elements\n3.2 Affective Elements\n\nMost philosophers agree that in addition to certain beliefs, gratitude\ncalls for certain feelings or affects in a\nbeneficiary, without which he fails to count as grateful. One notable\nexception is Hichem Naar (2019), who argues that mere grateful\nbeliefs, unaccompanied by feelings, can constitute a shallow kind of\ngratitude he calls \u201cgeneric gratitude\u201d, typically\nappropriate in response to trivial favors. Even Naar, however,\nacknowledges that \u201cdeep gratitude\u201d includes certain\nfeelings.\n\nPhilosophers largely agree that feelings of gratitude\u2014the\nfeelings that partly constitute a beneficiary\u2019s being\ngrateful\u2014are positive and agreeable feelings (Fitzgerald 1998;\nBruton 2003). Some philosophers claim that an act of beneficence\nshould incite feelings of joy and pleasure in the\ngrateful beneficiary\u2014and not just because of the benefit, but\nbecause he has benefited as a result of someone\u2019s benevolence\ntoward him (Camenisch 1981; Card 1988; McConnell 1993; Seneca On\nBenefits). Still others claim that gratitude entails a certain\naffection for the benefactor (Bruton 2003). These\ngeneralizations may not apply to gratitude in all cases, however. As\nManela (2016b) notes, feelings of gratitude can sometimes be quite\nnegative (i.e., painful or disagreeable): a beneficiary whose\nbenefactor sacrifices terribly in conferring her benefit on him should\nprobably feel grief or sadness, rather than joy or pleasure, insofar\nas he is grateful to her. And the proper response to a benefit from a\nbenefactor one finds loathsome need not amount to affection.\n\nSeveral philosophers suggest that as far as feelings go, gratitude\nrequires some degree of goodwill toward a benefactor,\nunderstood as wishing a benefactor well (Walker 1980\u20131981;\nHerman 2012). Goodwill in this sense should be understood not strictly\nspeaking as an affect, but as a disposition to have certain\naffects in certain situations\u2014what we might call an\naffective disposition (Manela 2016b). For a beneficiary to\nhave goodwill toward his benefactor is for the beneficiary to have\ndispositions to be pleased if things go well for her and a disposition\nto be sad or upset when things go poorly for her (Manela 2016b).\nInsofar as goodwill is necessary for gratitude, it may mark another\ndistinction between prepositional gratitude and propositional\n\u201cgratitude\u201d (Manela 2016a). I can be perfectly grateful\nthat it did not rain on my wedding day without wishing anyone\nwell. By contrast, it seems that I fail to be grateful to a\nbenefactor if I fail to wish her well after she does me a good\nturn.\n\nGratitude seems to call not only for the presence of certain affective\nelements, but the diminution or absence of certain\naffective elements as well. In particular, one affective disposition\nthought to be inconsistent or incompatible with gratitude is\nresentment: an affective disposition to feel pleasure when a\nbenefactor suffers, and displeasure when she fares well (Camenisch\n1981: 24; McConnell 1993: 83; Fitzgerald 1998: 131, fn 143; Bruton\n2003: 3; Roberts 2004: 69; Costello 2006: 270). Insofar as there was\nresentment between a benefactor and beneficiary before an act of\nbenevolence, a grateful beneficiary will be inclined to experience\nless resentment after the fact. A beneficiary who, in response to an\nact of benevolence, forms proper grateful beliefs but experiences\nincreased resentment toward his benefactor (perhaps out of\nenvy for her virtuously benevolent disposition) is guilty of an\nespecially vicious kind of ingratitude (see\n section 3.5).\n The fact that a beneficiary could form appropriate grateful beliefs\nbut still instantiate ingratitude (by consequently resenting his\nbenefactor) undermines the claim that grateful beliefs are sufficient\nfor a beneficiary to count as grateful in any meaningful sense\u2014a\nclaim Naar (2019) has tried to argue regarding what he calls\n\u201cgeneric gratitude\u201d.\n",
