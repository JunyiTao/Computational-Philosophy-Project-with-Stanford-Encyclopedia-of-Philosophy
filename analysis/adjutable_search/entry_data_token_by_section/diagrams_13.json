A central task of\nformalizing Euclid\u2019s diagrammatic proofs is accounting for\nthis\u2014i.e., providing with its rules a method for distinguishing\ngeneral co-exact features from non-general ones in diagrammatic\nrepresentations of constructions. The systems FG and\nEu take two different approaches to this task. \n\nEmploying the method of FG, one must produce with a\ndiagram every case that could result from the construction. A\ngeneral co-exact relation of the construction is then one that appears\nin every case. FG\u2019s demand that every case be\nproduced would, of course, be of a little interest if it did not also\nprovide a method for producing them all. The method\nFG provides depends on the fact that lines and\ncircles in the system\u2019s diagrams are defined in purely\ntopological terms. Their resulting flexibility makes it possible to\nformulate and implement in a computer program a general method for\ngenerating\n cases.[9]\n\n\nThe lines and circles of Eu diagrams are not\nsimilarly flexible. Accordingly, it cannot resolve the generality\nproblem via case-analysis as FG does. The central\nidea of its approach is to allow diagrams to hold partial information\nfrom the outset. Within an Eu derivation, the diagram\nproduced by a proof\u2019s construction has an initial content\nconsisting in all the qualitative relations of the proof\u2019s\ninitial diagram. The qualitative relations concerning objects added by\nthe construction cannot be read off the diagram immediately. Those\nthat can be read off the diagram must be derived by the system\u2019s\n rules.[10]\n\nThe differences between the FG and\nEu approaches to formalizing Euclid\u2019s\nconstructions can be understood as representing different general\nconceptions of the role of diagrams in mathematics.\nFG embodies a conception where diagrams concretely\nrealize a range of mathematical possibilities. They support\nmathematical inference by furnishing direct access to these\npossibilities. Eu in contrast embodies a conception\nwhere diagrams serve to represent in a single symbol the various\ncomponents of a complex mathematical situation. They support\nmathematical inference by allowing the mathematical reasoner to\nconsider all these components in one place, and to focus on those\ncomponents relevant to a proof.\n",
