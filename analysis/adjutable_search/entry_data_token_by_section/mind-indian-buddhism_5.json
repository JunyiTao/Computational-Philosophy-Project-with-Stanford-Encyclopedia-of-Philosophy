    "main_text": "Basic Principles || The Five Aggregates\n2.3 The Five Aggregates\n\n\nThe Buddhist tradition conceives of the human individual as \nconsisting of five types of aggregates that serve as the bases of what we\nordinarily designate as persons: (1) material form or body \n(r\u016bpa); (2) sensations (vedan\u0101); (3) \napperception (sa\u1e43j\u00f1a); (4) volitions or \ndispositional formations (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra); and (5) \nconsciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na). This aggregated view of \npersons informs all aspect of Buddhist thought and is indispensable \nto any account of cognition. Thus, in replacing the agent or \ncognizing \u2018I\u2019 with a play of causal factors resulting in \nmomentary cognitive events, the Buddhist tradition treats the \ncognizing agent as merely another way of referring to the embodied \nand dynamic functioning of the five aggregates. The specific nature \nof these aggregates is the subject of the Abhidharma descriptive \nanalytic (see \n \u00a73).\n Following Vasubandhu's Treasury of Higher Knowledge (AKBh \nad I, 14\u201316), the five aggregates may be defined as \nfollows:\n\nForm. The first collection of aggregates, form or \nmateriality (r\u016bpa-skandha), stands for objects regarded\nas compounded entities (sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta). Form is \nunderstood to be \u2018compounded\u2019 in only one of the two \nsenses in which compoundedness can be interpreted: that of being the \nproduct of causes and conditions (the other refers to entities that \nare produced by putting parts together). The category of form also \nincludes the sensory systems, which from an anatomical and \nphysiological point of view are material forms.\n\nFeeling. The second collection includes the aggregates of \nsensation or feeling (vedan\u0101-skandha) and defines the \nquality of the impressions that result from contact between the sense\nand its object. Sensations are generally divided into pleasant, \nunpleasant and neutral and depend on the sensory modality in which \nthey originate. As internal mental states, sensations are both \nconditioned by, and conditioning of, the habitual tendencies of past \nkarmic activity. \n\nApperception. The third collection of aggregates consists of\napperception (sa\u1e43j\u00f1a-skandha), and refers to the \ncapacity to comprehend the specific marks (nimitta) of \nphenomenal objects. The characteristic mark of a phenomenon is its \ndistinctive quality. The term itself is a derivative from \nsa\u1e43 + j\u00f1\u0101, meaning \u2018to \nunderstand,\u2019 \u2018to be aware of,\u2019 or more \nappropriately \u2018to make intelligible\u2019 or \u2018to cause \nto be understood,\u2019 thus indicating the causative function of \nperception predicates. As a synthetic mode of apprehension, \napperception is caused by a multiplicity of factors including \nmemories, expectations, dispositions, etc. In this generic sense, \napperception might be understood as broadly equivalent to the \nAristotelian sensus communis, the faculty that binds \ntogether the sensory input into a coherent representation of the \nobject, or to Kant's notion of the transcendental unity of \napperception.\n\nVolitions. The fourth collection of aggregates includes \ndispositional formations or volitions \n(sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta-skandha). Volitions are primarily \nresponsible for bringing forth future states of existence. They \ninclude all the conditioned factors that are intrinsic to \nconsciousness (sa\u1e43prayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) as well\nas factors that are dissociated from consciousness \n(viprayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra). Support for the view that \nmental factors dissociated from thought are to be included in the \ncategory of dispositional formations is found in the \nSa\u1e43yukta-Nik\u0101ya (V, 450): \u201cDelighting in \nsuch volitional formations, they generate volitional formations that \nlead to birth, generate volitional formations that lead to aging, \ngenerate volitional formations that lead to death, generate \nvolitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, \ndispleasure, and despair.\u201d Volitions, thus, are habitual \nlatencies that predispose and motivate an individual to have a \ncertain type of experience while at the same time conditioning the \nresponse to that experience.\n\nConsciousness. The fifth and last collection contains the \naggregates of consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na-skandha). In \ncontrast to apperception, consciousness is defined as the impression \n(vij\u00f1apti) of each object or as the bare apprehension \nof each object. Glossing on this definition, later Abhidharma \ncommentators treat consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na) as \nreferring to an awareness of the object alone \n(vastum\u0101tra) (see Ya\u015bomitra's \nVy\u0101khy\u0101 ad AK I, 16). Unlike sensation \nand apperception, which apprehend the specific characteristics of \nobjects, consciousness acts as an integrating and discerning factor \nof experience.\n\n\nIn the schematic analysis of the five aggregates only form is a\nphysical aggregate stricto sensu. While sensations,\napperception, and volitions can acquire an objectual aspect,\nthey are not empirical objects proper. Thus, a sensation such as pain\nis not reducible to the physical substrate, say a finger, in which it\nis instantiated. Rather, as object-oriented cognitive aspects,\nsensations, apperception, and volitions are included in the broader\nAbhidharma category of mental factors (caitasika).\nFurthermore, the empirical approach that characterizes the Buddhist\nanalysis of materiality does not imply physicalism, at least not in\nthe sense that everything is or supervenes on the physical. Rather,\nmateriality is analyzed as being reducible to the phenomenal content\nof experience. Thus, the formal properties of material objects are\nanalyzed either in terms of how they are impacted by contact or as\nfactors that oppose resistance. These properties, however, do not\nextend to the atoms themselves, which according to the Abhidharma form\nthe building blocks of materiality. As monadic units the atoms are\nseen as devoid of any formal properties\n(r\u016bpa\u1e47a). It is only as atomic compounds\n(sa\u1e43gh\u0101tastha,\nsa\u1e43cita) that atoms are subject to the same properties\nof resistance and destruction as composite material entities (see \n \u00a74.2).\n \n",
