    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || Rebellion and Regicide\n4.7 Rebellion and Regicide\n\nAt the end of the Second Treatise we learn about the nature\nof illegitimate civil governments and the conditions under which\nrebellion and regicide are legitimate and appropriate. As noted above,\nscholars now hold that the book was written during the Exclusion\nCrisis, and may have been written to justify a general insurrection\nand the assassination of the king of England and his brother. The\nargument for legitimate revolution follows from making the distinction\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate civil government. A legitimate\ncivil government seeks to preserve its subjects\u2019 life, health,\nliberty, and property insofar as this is compatible with the public\ngood. Because it does this, it deserves obedience. An illegitimate\ncivil government seeks to systematically violate the natural rights of\nits subjects. It seeks to make them illegitimate slaves. Because an\nillegitimate civil government does this, it puts itself in a state of\nnature and a state of war with its subjects. The magistrate or king of\nsuch a state violates the law of nature and so makes himself into a\ndangerous beast of prey who operates on the principle that might makes\nright, or that the strongest carries it. In such circumstances,\nrebellion is legitimate, as is the killing of such a dangerous beast\nof prey. Thus Locke justifies rebellion and regicide under certain\ncircumstances. Presumably, this justification was going to be offered\nfor the killing of the King of England and his brother had the Rye\nHouse Plot succeeded. Even if this was not Locke\u2019s intention, it\nstill would have served that purpose admirably.\n",
