    "main_text": "Uses for thought about coercion\n3. Uses for thought about coercion\n\nAlthough some writings on coercion might appear to aim principally for\nconceptual clarification, theorists of coercion more often aim to\nanswer questions that have practical import for ethics, judicial\ndecisions, political or legal theory, and social policy. Some of the\nmost common implications of claims about coercion are explored below.\nThe four subsections here (on the ethics of coercion, responsibility\nunder coercion, its effect on freedom, and its legal and political\nimplications) overlap in various ways, so while these subsections have\ndistinct foci, the discussions should not be taken to be fully\nindependent of one another.\n",
