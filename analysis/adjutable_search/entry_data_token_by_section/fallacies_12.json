    "main_text": "New approaches to fallacies || The informal logic approach to fallacies\n3.3 The informal logic approach to fallacies\n\nThe informal logic approach to fallacies is taken in Johnson and\nBlair\u2019s Logical Self-Defence, a textbook first\npublished in 1977. It was prompted in part by Hamblin\u2019s\nindictment of the standard treatment and it further develops an\ninitiative taken by Kahane (1971) to develop university courses that\nwere geared to everyday reasoning. Johnson and Blair\u2019s emphasis\nis on arming students to defend themselves against fallacies in\neveryday discourse, and a fundamental innovation is in their\nconception of a good argument. In place of a sound argument\u2014a\ndeductively valid argument with true premises\u2014Johnson and Blair\nposit an alternative ideal of a cogent argument, one whose\npremises are acceptable, relevant to and sufficient for its\nconclusion. Acceptability replaces truth as a premise requirement, and\nthe validity condition is split in to two different conditions,\npremise relevance and premise sufficiency. Acceptability is defined\nrelative to audiences\u2014the ones for whom arguments are\nintended\u2014but the other basic concepts, relevance and\nsufficiency, although illustrated by examples, remain as intuitive,\nundefined concepts (see Tindale, 2007). Premise sufficiency (strength)\nis akin to probability in that it is a matter of degree but Johnson\nand Blair do not pursue giving it numerical expression.\n\nThe three criteria of a cogent argument, individually necessary and\njointly sufficient, lead to a conception of fallacy as \u201cany\nargument that violates one of the criteria of good argument \u2026\nand is committed frequently in argumentative discourse\u201d (1993,\n317\u201318). This shares only one condition with SDF: that a fallacy\nis an argument. (Deductive) validity is replaced with the broader\nconcept sufficiency, and the appearance condition is not included.\nJohnson (1987) argued that the appearance condition makes the\noccurrence of fallacies too subjective since how things appear may\nvary from perceiver to perceiver, and it should therefore be replaced\nby a frequency requirement. To be a fallacy, a mistake must occur with\nsufficient frequency to be worth our attention.\n\nThe adoption of the concept of a cogent argument as an ideal has\nseveral consequences. The category of fallacies with problematic\npremises (reminiscent of Whately\u2019s \u201cpremises unduly\nassumed\u201d) shows a concern with argument evaluation over and\nbeyond logical or inference evaluation, drawing the informal logic\napproach away from purely logical concerns towards an epistemic\nconception of fallacies. Having both sufficiency and relevance as\ncriteria (instead of the single validity criterion) has the benefit of\nallowing the making of nuanced judgments about the level of premise\nsupport: for example, we might say that an argument\u2019s premises,\nalthough insufficient, are nevertheless positively relevant to the\nconclusion. Irrelevant premise fallacies are those with no premise\nsupport at all, whereas insufficient premise fallacies are those in\nwhich there is some support, but not enough of it. The informal\nlogicians\u2019 conception of fallacies is meant to be broader and\nmore suitable to natural language argumentation than would be a\nconception tied only to deductive invalidity.\n\nJohnson and Blair concern themselves exclusively with\ninformal fallacies. Many of the familiar Aristotelian\nfallacies that are part of the standard treatment are missing from\ntheir inventory (e.g., accident, composition and division) and the\nones retained find themselves in new categories: begging the question\nand ambiguity are together under the heading of Problematic Premise;\nappeals to authority and popularity are placed under the heading of\nHasty Conclusion fallacies; ad hominem is among the fallacies\nthat belong in the third category, Fallacies of Irrelevant Reason.\nThis new list of fallacies has a different bent than many earlier\nlists, being more geared to deal with arguments in popular, everyday\ncommunication than philosophical or scientific discourse; this is\nevident both by the omission of some of the traditional fallacies as\nwell as by the introduction of new ones, such as dubious assumption,\ntwo wrongs, slippery slope, and faulty analogy.\n\nThe kinds of mistakes one can make in reasoning are generally thought\nto be beyond enumeration and, hence, it has been maintained that there\ncan be no complete stock of fallacies that will guard against every\nkind of mistake. Johnson and Blair\u2019s approach is responsive to\nthis problem in that it allows the names of the classes of fallacies\n\u2014 \u2018unacceptable premise,\u2019 \u2018irrelevant\nreason\u2019 and \u2018hasty conclusion\u2019 \u2014 to stand for\nfallacies themselves, fallacies broad-in-scope; i.e., to serve\n\u201cboth as general principles of organization, and as back-ups to\nfill in any gaps between specific labels belonging within each\ngenus\u201d (1993, 52). Hence, any violation of one of the criteria\nof a cogent argument can be considered a fallacy.\n\nIn addition to this alternative theoretical approach to fallacies\nbuilt on the three criteria of a cogent argument\u2014an approach\nalso taken up by\n others[7]\u2014informal\n logic\u2019s contribution to fallacy studies lies in its attempts to\nprovide better analyses of fallacies, a programme pursued by a large\nnumber of researchers, including Govier (1982) on the slippery slope,\nWreen (1989) on the ad baculum, Walton (1991) on begging the\nquestion, Brinton (1995) on the ad hominem, Freeman (1995) on\nthe appeal to popularity, and Pinto (1995) on post hoc ergo\npropter hoc.\n",
