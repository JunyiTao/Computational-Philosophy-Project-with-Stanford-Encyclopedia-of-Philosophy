    "main_text": "\u201cJudaism and Culture\u201d\n2. \u201cJudaism and Culture\u201d\n\nIn her first essay, \u201cJudentum und Kultur\u201d (\u201cJudaism\nand Culture\u201d, 1907, hereafter JuK), which was also her first\narticle to appear in Frankfurter Zeitung, Susman offers a\nsuccinct argument for the Jewish tradition\u2019s critical\nsignificance for rethinking modernity as well as philosophy more\ngenerally. Critical of a reductionism that would cast Judaism as\nsimply a form of ethics, she argues that doing so would mean to\nunthinkingly submit to the tripartition of all human endeavors into\nesthetics, logics, and ethics. She suggests that, arbitrary and\nultimately unfeasible, this approach turns a blind eye to what might\nwell be the most fundamental dimension of all human endeavors, the\nreligious one. For Susman, the sphere of the religious constitutes the\nfocal point of all culture; all other forms of producing\nvalue\u2014the ethical, esthetic, and logical ones\u2014gather\naround it as that which grounds their purpose. Ethics, Susman notes,\ncontrary to widely shared views, has never been Judaism\u2019s single\npurpose but the means to pursue its task in history (JuK 1).\n\nWritten in the wake of Simmel\u2019s Religion (1906), which\npainted a vivid picture of the profound role religion continues to\nplay in modern culture and society, \u201cJudentum und Kultur\u201d\nargues against the call for assimilation and for the enduring and\nvital significance of Judaism\u2019s role in modern culture. In an\nearly gesture towards interfaith dialogue, the essay suggests, without\nreferencing Leo Baeck\u2019s argument in The Essence of\nJudaism (1905), that Judaism is not a religion of dogmas, thereby\nadding to Baeck\u2019s argument a striking and unexpected point.\nWestern culture, she notes, rests on Christian foundations that inform\nmodernity, inflecting its deepest longings and desires for redemption.\nTaking off the \u201cstraightjacket\u201d of Christian religion\nwould be tantamount to ripping apart the arteries and pulses of the\nculture\u2014in short, it would amount to a collapse of \u201cour\nwhole culture\u201d. While Christianity, unlike Judaism, has become a\ncompletely universalized religion that envisions human redemption in\npurely universal terms, its history is also\n\n\nan answer the history of humanity offers to the question of whether\nJudaism is free of dogmas and contains a living core.\n\n\nFor Christianity, she observes, \u201coriginated after all from\nJudaism\u201d (JuK 2). This insight constitutes a constant in\nSusman\u2019s thought; it accounts for the way she views the deeper\naffinities between Christianity and Judaism despite the fierce\nantagonism that exists between them, which she at no point denies.\n\nWhile this intuition resonates with Hermann Cohen\u2019s view\nconcerning the intimate embrace the two historical forces continue to\nbe engaged in, the particular way in which Susman sets religion\nsquarely beside ethics, epistemology, and aesthetics as a fourth and\nequally irreducible \u201corientation\u201d of its own anticipates\nthe critical motif that informs Cohen\u2019s Religion Out of the\nSources of Judaism (1919).\n",
