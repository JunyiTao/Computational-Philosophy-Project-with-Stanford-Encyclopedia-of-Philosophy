    "main_text": "Are determinates metaphysically prior to determinables? || Questions and implications\n4.4 Questions and implications\n\nThe previous considerations suggest that some determinable features of\nreality might be fundamental, or as fundamental as determinate\nfeatures. This result raises several questions, answers to which have\nimplications for our understanding of determinables and determinates,\nand of the fundamental.\n\nOne question pertains to whether the determinates associated with\nfundamental determinables are also part of the fundamental base. It\nmight seem so; for even granting that (fundamental) determinates\ncannot completely ground determinables, determinates seem also to be\nneeded to be existential witnesses for more specific goings-on. In\nthat case, a further question arises concerning how determinables and\ndeterminates jointly participate in a fundamental base. Wilson (2012)\nsuggests that a model for understanding such joint founding may be\nfound in the sciences, and more specifically in how general scientific\nlaws combine with initial or boundary conditions (15\u201316), an\nanalogy developed by French, who maintains that \u201cscientific\ndeterminables and determinates jointly enter into the fundamental base\nfor everything else\u201d (2014: 285). That said, there are arguably\nmetaphysical views on which only determinables are fundamental; for\nexample, Hubner and Matyasi (2020: 634) observe that Spinoza rejects\nthe view that determinates are among the fundamenta (insofar as the\none fundamental entity has only determinable features): \u201chis\nsubstance is both the least specific (indeterminate) and the most\nfundamental entity\u201d (e.g. Ep36; IV/185/29).\n\nA further question concerns whether existing non-reductionist accounts\nof determinables can make sense of these being fundamental. On the\nface of it, there is no special difficulty with accommodating\nfundamental determinables on either powers-based or constitution-base\naccounts of determination, or with such accounts\u2019 making sense\nof joint determinable/determinate founding. On Johansson\u2019s\n(2000) account, for example, it might be that determinates depend on\ndeterminables in that the latter are constitutive parts of the former\n(nota bene: not obeying weak supplementation), and\ndeterminables depend on determinates in that, modulo certain outside\ncase (e.g., gappy quantum indeterminacy;\n see \u00a75.3),\n determinable instances must be parts of some determinate whole.\n\nThat determinables and determinates may be jointly fundamental has\nimplications for our understandings of fundamentality and metaphysical\ndependence. Fundamental entities are commonly assumed to be\nindependent, in being wholly distinct, and (relatedly, as per\n\u2018Hume\u2019s Dictum\u2019) in being such that each can either\nexist together or exist apart. But if (some) determinables and\ndeterminates can be equally fundamental, this understanding is\nincorrect; for given the intimate relationship between determinables\nand determinates, to say that these are equally fundamental is\nevidently not to say either that they are wholly distinct or (even\ngranting Hume\u2019s Dictum) modally independent. Moreover, if\ndeterminables and determinates can mutually found each other, other\ncommonly stipulated suppositions are called into question\u2014e.g.,\nthat the fundamental entities are those that do not depend on any\nother entities, and that metaphysical dependence is asymmetric.\n\nThe possibility of fundamental determinables also bears on various\nfirst-order metaphysical topics. For example, Paul (2002, 2012)\nendorses a one-category ontology (\u2018mereological bundle\ntheory\u2019), on which properties and relations are fundamental, and\nproperty composition is \u201cthe fundamental glue\u201d (2012:\n242). Paul allows that determinables might be among the fundamental\nproperties and relations (note 22), and moreover suggests that such\nposits may be required to accommodate theories couched in terms of\nproperties and relations which are \u201cextremely abstractly\nspecified\u201d (2012: 245).\n",
