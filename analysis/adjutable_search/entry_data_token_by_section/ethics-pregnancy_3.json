    "main_text": "Ethical Issues in Obstetrical Care || Birth and Mode of Delivery\n2.2 Birth and Mode of Delivery\n\nAs discussed above, birth has been heavily medicalized in contemporary\nNorth America, while at the same time a vocal \u2018natural\nbirth\u2019 movement has pushed against medicalization. The\ndisagreement between these two camps often circulates around whether\nbirth is best thought of as a dangerous and abnormal process best\nmanaged by medical experts in an institutional setting, or as a\n\u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 bodily function that\nrequires formal medical intervention only in unusual cases. Proponents\nof \u2018natural\u2019 childbirth point out that current norms of\nhospital birth often result in a cascade of interventions (with the\nmajority of births involving labor inducing drugs and fetal\nmonitoring, for instance, both of which in turn raise the chance that\nthe labor will end with a cesarean section). In contrast, proponents\nof the medical model of birth argue that while serious complications\nduring labor are reasonably rare, they can occur quickly and their\neffects can be catastrophic, and it is simply good risk reasoning to\nhave the expertise and resources of high-tech medicine available\nduring labor.\n\nThere is no clear scientific method for assessing the overall benefits\nor detriments of normalizing highly technologically mediated,\nmedicalized birth. Most of the standard interventions during labor\nhave never been tested in any systematic fashion, but are rather part\nof a folk culture of medicine. The rhetorical valuation of either\n\u2018natural\u2019 or medically managed birth as safer, more\nresponsible, more maternal, etc. can function to enforce a set of\nsocial norms that are for the most part cut free from scientific\nevidence about the medical soundness of various birth decisions and\npaths (Kukla 2008, Lyerly 2006).\n\nLyerly (2006) argues that the problem with modern birthing practices\nis not the use of technology or the lack of it per se, for\ntechnology itself has no inherent meaning or import. Rather, the\nproblem lies in a culture of birth that is expert-centered rather than\npatient-centered. She draws on phenomenological work by Sandra Bartky\nin order to show how \u201cfemale shame is reinforced by dominant\nstrains of birthing practice\u2014both hospital-based obstetrics\nand midwifery\u201d (Ibid, 103). She writes, \u201cAnalyses\nthat focus on models of birthing rather than women's emotional lives\nfail to capture the substance of the insult that women have recently\nincurred in giving birth. In holding technology culpable, these\nanalyses are not only inaccurate but also threaten to disenfranchise\nwomen for whom sensitively applied medical practices can enhance both\nthe safety and agency so important to a good birth\u201d (Ibid, p.\n117). When misused, technology can subjugate women to medical\nauthority, undercut their sense of dignity and control, and alienate\nthem from the birth process. But it can also be used to enhance\nwomen's agency (such as when pain medication enables a woman to\nmaintain her dignity and presence of mind at her birth, or when a\nscheduled cesarean allows a woman to feel confident that she will have\nher partner who is about to deploy overseas present at her birth).\nMeanwhile, a relatively \u2018natural\u2019 birth that does not get\ncaught up in a cascade of medical interventions can be empowering. But\nnatural childbirth advocates often paint an idealized picture of how\nbirth is supposed to proceed (see also Crossley 2007), and\ntreat \u2018success\u2019 at natural childbirth as a mark of\nmaternal character (see also Kukla 2008). Women who for various\nreasons\u2014including pre-existing medical conditions or various\ncomplications during labor\u2014do not manage to have a vaginal\ndelivery free of pain medication and medical intervention may feel\nthat they have \u2018failed\u2019 to give birth properly.\n\nEthical debate surrounds when and how women ought to be able to choose\nto have a cesarean delivery for non-medical reasons. Because there is\nno validated and universal medical code to indicate such deliveries,\nwe do not know whether elective cesareans (typically referred to as\nCesarean Deliveries on Maternal Request, or CDMRs) significantly\nimpact the overall cesarean rate or are a rare novelty. Nevertheless,\nin light of several notorious cases of celebrity CDMRs, the issue has\nsparked intense controversy. Some worry about the prevalence of\ncesarean sections indicating the rise of a technological imperative in\nstandard obstetrical practice (Burrow 2012). On the other hand, women\nwho choose cesarean deliveries are often stereotyped as \u201ctoo\nposh to push\u201d, and seen as privileging their own convenience\nover their children's well-being and their maternal responsibilities.\nEmpirical evidence, however, does not decisively support either\nbirthing method. A 2006 NIH State of the Science conference assessed\nthe available scientific evidence concerning the short and long term\nrisks to women and infants of vaginal and surgical delivery, and\nconcluded that there was insufficient evidence to issue a\nrecommendation concerning the relative safety of planned vaginal and\ncesarean births. The most comprehensive meta-analyses reveal different\nrisks in each case that are hard to commensurate and a dearth of\nhigh-quality data. Thus from a narrowly medical evidence-based point\nof view there is no justification for recommending one approach to\ndelivery over the other (Minkoff 2006, Young Mi and D'Alton 2008).\n\nThere is a clear sense in which expanding women's voluntary access to\ncesarean deliveries increases women's autonomy: it gives women more\noptions. Some of the ethical literature on this issue\n(Minkoff and Chervenak 2003, Schwartz 2004) takes it as obvious that\nincorporating CDMR into obstetrical practice would enhance patient\nautonomy, and then asks whether this advantage is offset by the harm\nof unnecessary surgery. But others have argued that autonomy consists\nof more than choice, and that in social context, making CDMR routinely\navailable might actually impede women's autonomy (Bergeron 2007, Kukla\net al. 2009). In a context where doctors have high cognitive and\nsocial authority, and technological intervention and management are\nassociated with safety, the offer of CDMR will not be a neutral offer\nbut one that has performative force and a normative valence: it will\nnot merely report on an option, but may well alter the woman's\npreferences and her understanding of what counts as a socially\nsanctioned choice. Furthermore, the act of offering CDMR may itself\ncontribute to the normalization of technologically intensive birth and\nmedicalization. If, over time, cesarean section is routinely offered\nas an option, then it may become the norm, as women will feel that the\nmore predictable and expertly managed option is the more responsible\nchoice. And, as cesarean deliveries become increasingly normalized,\nobstetricians' skills at vaginal delivery might attenuate, in turn\ncreating more need for cesarean deliveries and eventually perhaps\nmaking vaginal delivery a choice out of reach for most women (Little\net al. 2008).\n",
