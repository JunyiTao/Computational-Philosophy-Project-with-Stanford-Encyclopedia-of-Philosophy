    "main_text": "Semantics || Rule of Use\n2.5 Rule of Use\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s entry for the first person\npronoun \u201cI\u201d says: \u201cUsed by the speaker or writer\nreferring to himself or herself.\u201d This is plausibly a linguistic\nrule: it is correct English to use \u201cI\u201d this way. The\ndefinition also determines the reference of (a particular utterance\nof) \u201cI\u201d. It seems reasonable, then, to think of this rule\nas giving the meaning of \u201cI\u201d (Kaplan 1989a: 520\u2013521;\nReichenbach 1947, 284).\n\nThis is handy: we now have an example of the form the meaning of a\nreferring expression can take. The first benefit is that we can\nconfirm that this kind of meaning doesn\u2019t generate necessities,\nthe way the meaning of \u201cbachelor\u201d did. Suppose\n\u201cI\u201d means the speaker in the context (Kaplan\n1989a: 495). Well, it is possible to be me without being the speaker\nin the context. Though I am speaking now, I might have remained silent\n(Kaplan 1989a: 509).\n\nIt is evident, too, that the meaning of \u201cI\u201d cannot perform\nthe duties of an interpersonal Fregean sense (discussed in\n Section 2.2).\n The rule determining the reference of an utterance of \u201cI\u201d\n(what Kaplan calls its character) is not the\nsame as the contribution such an utterance makes to the communicated\ncontent (the cognitive significance of the utterance) on a particular\noccasion of use. Indeed, whereas \u201cI\u201d has a fixed\ncharacter, it contributes different senses when uttered by different\npeople (see Frege 1918\u20131919 [1956: 296]).\n\nThe rule is not irrelevant to the cognitive significance of an\nutterance of the term, of course; and may be considered the mode by\nwhich its interpersonal content is presented (Kaplan 1989a: 530).\nMoreover, the meaning of \u201cI\u201d supports a priori\ninferences of a particular sort (Kaplan 1989a: 508\u2013509). For\ninstance, no empirical investigation is required to divine that an\nutterance of \u201cI\u201d refers to the one uttering it. Hence,\n\u201cI am the one uttering this sentence\u201d is a\npriori.\n\nThe meaning of \u201cI\u201d provides a model for the meaning of\nnames, but is there a candidate meaning for a name that fits this\nmodel? \u201cI\u201d does not refer to the same person every time it\nis used, so we might reasonably suppose that it provides a better\nmodel for a generic name\u2014also used for different\npeople\u2014than a specific one. The rough thinking being that if a\nname is only ever used to refer to one thing (as a specific name is),\nthere is no real need for a general rule of use.\n\nWhat would a rule of use for a generic name look like? If\n\u201cI\u201d constrains reference to the speaker in the context,\nthen generic \u201cAlice\u201d, in most situations (unless the\nreferent is a protected witness, for example), constrains reference to\npersons called \u201cAlice\u201d. A semantic rule of use for generic\n\u201cAlice\u201d would thus amount to a metalinguistic account of\nits meaning. More will be said motivating and criticizing such a\nstance in the dedicated\n section (2.10)\n to come, but I will preview a major criticism of the view that names\nhave a metalinguistic rule of use below.\n\nThe rule governing the use of a generic name like \u201cAlice\u201d\nhas been spelled out by various theorists in similar ways (Burks 1951;\nLerner & Zimmermann 1984, 1991; Haas-Spohn 1995; Recanati 1997;\nPelczar & Rainsbury 1998). On each occasion of use, a referent for\nthe name will be more-or-less available, or obligatory, depending on\nthe familiarity and salience of a convention that tags that referent\nwith that generic name. So a minimal rule of use for\n\u201cAlice\u201d would require each utterance to refer to one to\nwhom that (generic) name has been conventionally attached. A stronger\nversion would have it that an utterance of \u201cAlice\u201d\nobligatorily refers to the most salient individual of this sort.\n\nAs Kaplan (1989a: 562) points out, there is a competing account of the\nvariable reference of names that does not treat them as generic\nexpressions with a metalinguistic meaning (rule of use). On that\naccount, the variation in reference is due to either ambiguity or\nhomonymy (i.e., there are many different \u201cspecific\u201d names\nwith the same form), and what passes for a rule of use on the\nmetalinguistic theory is not properly ascribed to the meaning of names\nat all, but is rather a more generally applicable procedure of\ndisambiguation (see also Evans 1973, as well as Evans 1982, where\nname-using practices, rather than specific names, are settled on in\nthe process of disambiguation).\n\nTo illustrate the difference, recall that it is a convention of\nEnglish that a speaker uses \u201cI\u201d to refer to themselves.\nThat convention is available to us, roughly speaking, whenever we are\nconversing with fellow English speakers, and we must always\ndisambiguate an uttered token of \u201cI\u201d (distinguishing it,\nsay, from homophone \u201ceye\u201d) prior to applying this\nconvention to determine the token\u2019s referent. The availability\nof the \u201cI\u201d convention in a conversation, and the\ndisambiguation of an individual token of \u201cI\u201d, while\ncrucial to communication, are matters that come before applying its\nrule of use, and so are distinct from the matters addressed in that\nrule.\n\nWe might go so far as to say that the sort of things a metalinguistic\nrule of use ranges over\u2014conventions and the like\u2014are just\nnot suitable targets for linguistic meanings (compare Pelczar &\nRainsbury 1998: 297\u2013298). However, a rule of use just like the\none advanced for generic \u201cAlice\u201d is very plausible for\ncertain other expressions. For instance, \u201cthe tall Alice\u201d\nor even just \u201cthe Alice\u201d (see Jeshion 2017 for\nunexceptionable examples of the latter) is a context-sensitive phrase\nused to refer to the most salient individual satisfying a\nmetalinguistic predicate (either being tall and being called\n\u201cAlice\u201d, or just being called \u201cAlice\u201d). For\nsuch examples, disambiguation between a number of different senses (of\neither \u201cthe Alice\u201d or \u201cthe tall Alice\u201d) is not\na plausible account.\n\nIt is obvious in hindsight that natural language, in its versatility,\nwould not disbar metalinguistic rules of use. Still, the point remains\nthat ceteris paribus we should prefer pre-semantic\ndisambiguation as an explanation, since it is required anyway, to\nintroducing a metalinguistic rule of use that apes it.\n",
