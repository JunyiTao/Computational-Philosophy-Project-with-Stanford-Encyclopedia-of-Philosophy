    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe epistemic question posed by evil is whether the world contains\nundesirable states of affairs that provide the basis for an argument\nthat makes it unreasonable to believe in the existence of\nGod.\n\n\nThis discussion is divided into eight sections. The first is\nconcerned with some preliminary distinctions; the second, with the\nchoice between deductive versions of the argument from evil, and\nevidential versions; the third, with alternative evidential\nformulations of the argument from evil; the fourth, with the\ndistinction between three very different types of responses to the\nargument from evil: attempted total refutations, defenses, and\ntheodicies. The fifth section then focuses upon attempted total\nrefutations, while the sixth is concerned with defenses, and the\nseventh with some traditional theodicies. The possibility of more\nmodest variants on defenses and theodicies, based on the idea of\nglobal properties, is then considered in section eight.\n",
