Biographical Sketch\n\nNicolai Hartmann (b. Riga, 1882, d. G\u00f6ttingen, 1950) was\nrecognized in the first half of the twentieth century as one of the\nleading German philosophers, on a par with Husserl, Jaspers, or\nHeidegger. Born in Riga, in what was then called the Livonia\nGovernorate, a German-speaking part of the Russian Empire (now\nLatvia), Hartmann was Baltic German, spoke German at home and Russian\nat school, and at age fifteen went to a German boarding school in St.\nPetersburg. His engineer father died suddenly when Hartmann was eight\nyears old, but left him with a predilection for both music and\nastronomy, hobbies that would remain with him throughout his life.\nAfter gymnasium in St. Petersburg, he studied medicine for two years\nin Dorpat (Tartu, Estonia), decided that a more comprehensive course\nof study would be more satisfying, and switched to studying philosophy\nand classical philology, again in St. Petersburg. Revolutionary\nuprisings there led to the closing of the university in 1905. As a\nBaltic German, he did not see himself directly involved in Russian\naffairs, and, unwilling to interrupt his studies, he transferred from\ncosmopolitan St. Petersburg to the landlocked town of Marburg,\nGermany, to study philosophy with Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131919) and Paul\nNatorp (1854\u20131924), the leaders of what was later to be called the\n\u201cMarburg School\u201d of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nHe completed his degree in summer 1907 with his work \u201cOn the\nProblem of Being in Greek Philosophy before Plato\u201d\n(\u00dcber das Seinsproblem in der griechischen Philosophie vor\nPlato, Hartmann 1908). His massive \u201cPlato\u2019s Logic of\nBeing\u201d (Platos Logik des Seins) and the shorter\n\u201cProclus Diadochus\u2019 Philosophical Foundations of\nMathematics\u201d (Des Proklus Diadochus philosophische\nAnfangsgr\u00fcnde der Mathematik, Habilitation)\nappeared in 1909. All of these show the imprint of his Neo-Kantian\nteachers. Probably influenced by reading the phenomenologists,\nincluding Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938) and Max Scheler (1874\u20131928); by\nthe rediscovery of Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754) through the work\nof Hans Pichler (1882\u20131958); and finally, by rereading\nAristotle, Kant, and Hegel during the period of a general Hegel\nrenaissance, he began to break free of Neo-Kantianism (Harich 2000).\nWhile he was teaching in Marburg and publishing a number of shorter\nworks that prefigure his later ideas, he was called to serve in WWI.\nStarting in 1914, he served as an interpreter and letter-censor. He\nspent time on the Eastern Front, and then returned to Marburg in 1918.\nBy the time he returned to Marburg, Cohen had left for Berlin and\nNatorp\u2019s influence was in decline, and he was greeted as their\nsuccessor. By this time, however, he was also the furthest of any of\ntheir former students from the Neo-Kantian position (Harich 2000).\nReflecting on his career, he declared 1919 the year he worked out his\nfinal approach to a \u201cnew ontology.\u201d\n\nHe became professor at Marburg in 1920, and then came to occupy\nNatorp\u2019s Chair in 1922. Hartmann was called to K\u00f6ln, where\nScheler was teaching, in 1924, where he taught until 1931. There he\nmet his second wife, Frida Hartmann (n\u00e9e Rosenfeld),\nin the \u201cdiscussion circle\u201d of philosophy students and\nprofessors that he hosted at his own home throughout his entire career\n(Fischer and Hartung 2020). He was appointed professor in Berlin in\n1931, as the \u201csafer\u201d choice in contrast to both Heidegger\nand Cassirer, who were also candidates for the post (Gerhardt et al.\n2015). After the Second World War, Hartmann was elected President of\nthe German Philosophical Association for both the acknowledged value\nof his philosophical ideas and his apparent lack of any improper\ncompromise with Nazism. (For more complete biographical information,\nsee Harich 2000, Heiss 1961, and F. Hartmann 1978.) While\nHartmann\u2019s presence and influence were strong during his\nlifetime, after his death in 1950 his ideas attracted no further\nattention. It is difficult to determine why things have gone this way.\nEven researchers of Neo-Kantianism have completely ignored\nHartmann\u2019s work, despite his intellectual biography and the fact\nthat his work shares numerous features with both Marburg and\nSouthwestern Neo-Kantianism (see, e.g., Luft 2015; De Warren and\nStaiti 2015). Although lack of translations into English and the\nworking of \u201cselective memory\u201d (Beiser 2014) have certainly\nplayed their part, other reasons are needed to explain this situation.\nHartmann has likely been ignored by scholars of Continental philosophy\nnot least because, historically and politically, Heidegger came to\ndominate German philosophy and was antagonistic to him, seeing the\nolder Hartmann as one of his chief rivals. Concerted historical\nresearch is needed to understand this state of neglect.\n\nLike many other philosophers of the time, Hartmann rejected system\nbuilding as the goal of philosophy, but he embraced a systematic and\ncareful mode of philosophizing. He had a perennial suspicion of\nultimate solutions. His open-ended dialogical attitude was not\ndogmatic, and he did not encourage students to adopt his positions on\nissues but to think for themselves about topics systematically. This\nattitude is especially evident in the recently published transcripts\nof his beloved \u201cdisputation circles\u201d (Fischer and Hartung\n2020). In his writing, he adopted a non-speculative, sober style of\nanalysis. His language was clear, and his method was rigorous, almost\npedantic, proceeding punctiliously step by step, without anticipating\nsolutions or taking anything for granted. His writings are organized\nin such a way that the reader is held in check and feels unable to\nforesee the next step in the argumentation. Virtuosic expertise in the\nhistory of philosophy is displayed throughout his works.\n\nOn the whole, he comes off as a \u201cclassical\u201d philosopher in\na time when philosophical fashion seemed to demand anything but that.\nThe explosion of philosophical schools and movements in the early\ntwentieth century, eager for novelty and controversy, seemed to have\nhad little tolerance or interest in patient investigations into major\ntraditional problems of philosophy. He was strongly shaped by late\nnineteenth century Neo-Kantianism and its issues, including the\ncontroversies over materialism, the limits of science, historicism\n(relativism), and pessimism, and was at least inspired by empirically\noriented metaphysicians such as Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881),\nAugust Trendelenburg (1802\u20131872), and Eduard von Hartmann (1842\u20131906)\n(see Beiser 2014). Recent work has also examined the influence of\nRussian philosophers on him (Tremblay 2017; Tremblay 2019). He thought\nof himself as a more faithful Kantian than the German Idealists as\nwell as his Neo-Kantian teachers and peers, honored Kant\u2019s\nmemory by taking seriously the claim that that there are some problems\nthat reason cannot solve, but criticized Kant himself for his dogmatic\nidealist assumptions. Aristotle and Hegel were also major sources of\ninspiration.\n\nRecent work on Hartmann has shown that he dealt with central twentieth\ncentury problems, such as the realism-antirealism debate, the\nreductionism-pluralism alternative, and with ways to resolve the\n\u201ctwo cultures\u201d divide that continues to torment\ncontemporary philosophy (Peterson 2017; Peterson and Poli 2016;\nHartung, Wunsch, and Strube 2012). His systematic and novel responses\nto these problems should be of interest to a contemporary audience,\nwhatever their philosophical pedigree. The establishment of the\n Nicolai Hartmann Society\n has shown that scholars interested in Nicolai Hartmann and his ideas\nare present everywhere, not only in North America and Europe but also\nin South America and Asia. The proceedings of international\nconferences on Nicolai Hartmann (Poli, Scognamiglio, Tremblay 2011;\nHartung, Wunsch, and Strube 2012; Peterson and Poli 2016; Peterson\n2017b; Kalckreuth, Schmieg, and Hausen 2019) and this entry provide\ninformation on Hartmann\u2019s thought that may facilitate a renewed\nevaluation of his contributions to philosophy.\n2. Works\n\nThree English translations of major book-length works have appeared\nwithin the last ten years, adding to the two existing translations and\nreissues of New Ways of Ontology (Hartmann 2012b [1953]) and\nthe Ethics (Hartmann 2003, 2004 [1932]), originally published\nearlier in the twentieth century. Volumes one and two of his ontology,\nOntology: Laying the Foundations (2019a [1935]) and\nPossibility and Actuality (2013 [1938]), as well as the\nposthumous Aesthetics (2014 [1953]), have been completed. New\ntranslations of shorter works include \u201cHow is Critical Ontology\nPossible?\u201d (Hartmann 2012a [1924]), \u201cThe Megarian and the\nAristotelian Concept of Possibility\u201d (Hartmann 2017 [1937]), an\nobituary for Max Scheler (Hartmann 2019b [1928]), and Hartmann\u2019s\n1914 review of the first volume of Husserl\u2019s Jahrbuch\n(Hartmann 2018). Other translations will no doubt be produced in the\ncoming years.\n\nEnglish readers have only a handful of book-length treatments of\nHartmann\u2019s thought to consult (Peterson and Poli 2016; Poli,\nScognamiglio, and Tremblay 2011; Kelly 2011; Werkmeister 1990;\nCadwallader 1984; and Mohanty 1957). For German readers, Martin\nMorgenstern\u2019s Nicolai Hartmann: Zur Einf\u00fchrung\n(1997) provides a comprehensive, if very brief, introduction, and\nWolfgang Harich\u2019s two works Nicolai Hartmann: Leben, Werk,\nWirkung (2000), as well as Nicolai Hartmann: Gr\u00f6sse und\nGrenzen (2002), provide unparalleled insights into the life and\nwork of Hartmann.\n\nWhile he wrote at length and with significant originality on\nepistemology, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy of history, natural and\nsocial science, and many other topics, Hartmann\u2019s central\npreoccupation was with developing a new ontology adequate to the\nchanged scientific and humanistic intellectual landscape of the early\ntwentieth century. Since Hartmann himself indicated 1919 as the year\nhe finally broke through to what he called his \u201cnew\nontology\u201d (Harich 2000, 9), we could divide his voluminous work\ninto two periods: an earlier Neo-Kantian inflected period, and a later\nperiod defined by the new ontology. But even this line is difficult to\ndraw cleanly. The published works for his degree referred to above\nfall clearly into the earlier period, while some early essays, such as\n\u201cSystematische Methode\u201d (1912) and \u201c\u00dcber die\nErkennbarkeit des Apriorischen\u201d (1914), already show signs of\nmoving beyond the confines of the Marburg approach. The book\nFundamental Philosophical Questions of Biology\n(Philosophische Grundfragen der Biologie, 1912) also stands\nout in this period as his earliest attempt to tackle the ontological\nissues contained in philosophy of biology. Here we will set aside the\nworks of the earlier period.\n\nThe inter-war period was the time of his most extensive output. In his\n1921 Grundz\u00fcge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis\n(Fundamentals of a Metaphysics of Cognition), Hartmann\ndeclares his independence from the Marburg school (while occupying the\nChair of one of its founders) by challenging one of its central\ntenets: cognition does not create its objects, as Neo-Kantianism\nholds, but grasps something that exists independently of it. Put\nbriefly, the Metaphysics of Cognition discusses the\ninteraction between epistemology and ontology and the unavoidable\ndependence of any epistemology on ontological assumptions. He\npublished his truly magisterial, innovative and comprehensive work on\nEthics in 1926, which includes some extensive remarks on the\nontology of values in some core chapters (Hartmann 2002\u20132004). The\nfirst volume of the commissioned Die Philosophie des deutschen\nIdealismus (The Philosophy of German Idealism,\non Kant, Fichte, and the Romantics) appeared in 1923. Two very\nimportant essays on ontology also appeared in the mid-twenties,\n\u201cHow is Critical Ontology Possible?\u201d (2012 [1924]), and\n\u201cKategoriale Gesetze\u201d (\u201cCategorial Laws,\u201d\n1926), which are the major precursors of his fully developed\nontological views. If we set aside his continued strong output of\nessay-length work, then between 1926 and 1935 his major publications\ninclude Volume 2 of his Die Philosophie des deutschen\nIdealismus (Philosophy of German Idealism) in 1929,\nZum Problem der Realit\u00e4tsgegebenheit (On the Problem\nof the Givenness of Reality) in 1931 (reprinted in Hartung and\nWunsch 2014, 177\u2013264), as well as Das Problem des geistigen Seins:\nUntersuchungen zur Grundlegung der Geschichtsphilosophie und der\nGeisteswissenschaften (The Problem of Spiritual Being:\nInvestigations into the Foundations of the Philosophy of History and\nthe Human Sciences) in 1933. On the Problem of the Givenness\nof Reality is significant not only because it is revised and\nincorporated into Part III of Ontology: Laying the\nFoundations, but because it was originally presented to a meeting\nof the Kant-Gesellschaft in Halle dedicated to the \u201cturn to\nontology and realism in contemporary philosophy\u201d (Hartung and\nWunsch 2014, 181). Subsequent to Ontology: Laying the\nFoundations in 1935, he steadily churned out the remaining\nvolumes of his ontological work, publishing Possibility and\nActuality in 1938 (Hartmann 2013), Aufbau in 1940, and\nhe completed the fourth volume Philosophy of Nature in 1943,\nalthough it was not published until 1950, after all of the other\nvolumes could be republished after WWII. The Aesthetics,\nunder revision at the time of his death, was posthumously published in\n1953 (Hartmann 2014).\n\nGiven the vast scope and meticulous reasoning of Hartmann\u2019s\nwork, this entry cannot aspire to adequately present its rich content.\nBut since Hartmann was a problem-oriented thinker, the task will be\nmade easier by discussing the theses of his major works under the\nheadings of the problems with which he was attempting to deal. In the\nremaining four sections, we will look at Hartmann\u2019s responses to\nthese questions: What is the relationship between thinking and being?\nWhat is valuable, and relatedly, what is the place of humankind in the\nworld? What is the structure of the real world? Finally, in the\nConclusion, What is Philosophy?, we will also very briefly consider\nHartmann\u2019s conception of philosophy in relation to that of his\ncontemporaries.\n\nSince Hartmann organized his bulky books into short chapters,\nsubdivided into sections usually no longer than two or three pages, we\nfollow his method of internal referencing by indicating the relevant\nchapters and sections. The following abbreviations will be used: ME =\nGrundz\u00fcge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis; S =\n\u201cSystematische Philosophie in eigener Darstellung\u201d; ET1 =\nEthics (Volume 1: Moral Phenomena); ET2 = Ethics\n(Volume 2: Moral Values); ET3 = Ethics (Volume 3: Moral\nFreedom); P = Problem des geistigen Seins; OLF =\nOntology: Laying the Foundations; PA = Possibility and\nActuality; A = Der Aufbau der realen Welt; N =\nPhilosophie der Natur; ELO = \u201cErkenntnis im Lichte der\nOntologie\u201d; NW = New Ways of Ontology; and AE =\nAesthetics. The chapters of various Introductions\nwill be referred to as \u201cIntro\u201d. For example,\n\u201cNIntro5\u201d and \u201cN3c\u201d will respectively refer to\nSection 5 of the Introduction and Chapter 3, Section c of the\nPhilosophy of Nature. (These abbreviations are also included\nbefore the bibliography below.)\n3. What is the Relationship between Thinking and Being?\n\nHartmann was committed to approaching the problem of cognition from\nthe perspective of its embeddedness in a broader cognitive and\nontological context. Human cognition is in a perpetual state of\nunrest, dynamically allowing us to get our bearings in an\noverstimulating environment, to orient ourselves in the world, and to\npursue practical projects. It is an active and open process of coming\nto terms with an environing world in historical time, not an isolated\nand static epistemological exercise. In our unrest we come up against\nproblems in need of solution. Hartmann was strongly influenced by\nKant\u2019s famous claim that experience presents problems that\nreason is unable to solve, such as the \u201cantinomies\u201d\nbearing on the origin of the cosmos and of freedom. This is a claim\nabout the limitations of human reason, and more generally, a statement\nabout the relation between thinking and being. Contrary to dogmatic\nmetaphysics, Kant claimed that thinking does not have complete access\nto being. Our very consciousness that there are problems in\nreality\u2014not just temporary, episodic problems but perennial,\nenduring ones\u2014in fact demonstrates this limitation quite\nclearly. If we begin with the whole \u201cphenomenon of\ncognition,\u201d as Hartmann did in his groundbreaking\nepistemological work, and not merely with the narrower relation\nbetween subject and object, we see that it includes features such as\n\u201cproblem consciousness\u201d and \u201ccognitive\nprogress.\u201d These complex \u201cfacts,\u201d he showed,\npresuppose that there is an ontological basis for what is cognized.\nThe main point of Metaphysics of Cognition was that\nepistemological discussions always entail ontological assumptions\nabout the nature of what exists. Determining the minimum set of these\nassumptions for an adequate account of cognitive phenomena was its\ntask.\n\nIn distinguishing himself from his predecessors and peers, Hartmann\ncarefully situated himself between various forms of idealism and\nexaggerated scientific realism. In contrast to his \u201clogical\nidealist\u201d teachers, German Idealists like Hegel, and\nphenomenological idealism, Hartmann thought that human thinking did\nnot have easy access to its own workings, let alone those of the real\nworld, and they certainly did not play the primary role in\n\u201cconstituting\u201d the world. In contrast to na\u00efve\nrealists and positivists, he did not think that human perception and\nexperience provided an unmediated adequate cognition of the world\neither. Deliberately positioning himself between these forms of\nidealism and na\u00efve realism, Hartmann produced a\n\u201ccritical\u201d epistemology that based itself on Kantian\nprinciples.\n\nAs one of the phenomena of cognition, Hartmann took human\nconsciousness of problems very seriously. He believed that in the\nhistory of philosophy and science, thinkers arrived at many so-called\nsolutions to problems by means of hasty theoretical assumptions rather\nthan patient investigation. Any philosophy deserving of the epithet\n\u201ccritical\u201d must be able to set aside the assumptions that\narise from theoretical \u201cstandpoints\u201d that can prejudice an\ninvestigation from the start. Critical philosophy, for Hartmann,\ndesignates a stance \u201cthis side\u201d of idealism and realism,\nengaging an epoch\u00e9 (suspension) with respect to\nquestionable standpoints. Such standpoints can blind us to seeing what\nis \u201ctranshistorical\u201d in the history of philosophy, as well\nas to what is \u201cgiven\u201d in phenomena. The contrast between\nthe historical and the transhistorical is a significant one for\nHartmann and shapes much of his thinking. It does not coincide with\nthe traditional contrast between timeless essences and historical\nparticulars, for instance, but cuts across it, as we explain\nbelow.\n\nIt is already evident in the definition of problems themselves. Three\naspects of problems must be distinguished. There is the\n\u201cstatement of the problem\u201d (Problemstellung), its\nparticular and perhaps idiosyncratic characterization; there is the\n\u201ccurrent state of the problem\u201d (Problemlage),\nmore stable but still historically malleable; and there are the\n\u201ccontents of the problem\u201d (Problemgehalt),\nincluding its sometimes nonrational and impenetrable aspects, which\nare properly \u201cmetaphysical.\u201d It is worth quoting at\nlength:\n\nHuman beings are the ones who first \u201cstate\u201d problems\n(Problemstellung); they are brought up to see the current\nstate of the problems (Problemlage) in a tradition, but also\nlabor to transform this situation themselves. By no means, however, do\nhuman beings have dominion over the contents of problems\n(Problemgehalt). There is nothing in the problem contents\nthat is a product of human artifice. The problem content is already\ngiven along with the overall structure of the world and the place of\nhumankind in it, and something of this content can change only to the\ndegree that the world and humankind also change in their fundamental\nfeatures. The history of problems does not have to do with the problem\ncontents (Problemgehalt), but only with the stepwise shifting\nof the current state of the problem (Problemlage) tied to\nthem and the multifariously varying statements of the problems\n(Problemstellung) within these contours. Problem contents\npersist identically, while the latter emerge or are submerged\nhistorically in unforeseeable variety (ME1b).\n\n\nTranshistorical \u201cproblem contents\u201d could include both real\nand ideal factors, and only meticulous investigation can determine\nwhat these are. Unfortunately, there is no a priori way to\ndetermine which is which. While this conception of\n\u201cproblems\u201d is likely influenced by the southwestern\nNeo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband (1958 [1893]), this distinction is\nactually widely applicable throughout Hartmann\u2019s work. The same\ntranshistorical-historical division applies to ethical values as well\nas to ontological and cognitive categories, though in different ways.\nIn general, it allows Hartmann to take a middle path between the\nextremes of absolutism and relativism, whether in regard to\nepistemology, ethics, or to ontology. Investigation of phenomena in\nall of these areas leads us to see that some core factors are\nrelatively stable, while other elements are culturally and\nhistorically variable. This conception of problems sits midway between\nthe Anglo-analytic view that problems like \u201cthe\nmind-body problem\u201d are simply \u201cthere\u201d and have\nnothing historical about them, and a historicist view in which\neverything about the problem is historical, with no stable problematic\nfactors at all.\n\nKant\u2019s work inspired this stance on the relation between\nthinking and being, as we see in Hartmann\u2019s sophisticated\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s \u201csupreme principle.\u201d\nReaders will recall Kant\u2019s principle: \u201cthe conditions of\nthe possibility of experience in general must at the same time be the\nconditions of the possibility of the objects of experience\u201d\n(Kant 1998 [1787], A158/B197). This was Kant\u2019s attempt to\nformulate a universal basic principle for the relation between\nthinking and the world. For Kant, this meant that the\nintersubjectively and objectively valid \u201cforms of\nintuition\u201d and the \u201cconcepts of the understanding,\u201d\nwhich science relies on to explain the objects of experience, must be\ndictated by the mind to the world in its very experience of things.\nHartmann argued that this expresses a \u201crestricted identity\nthesis,\u201d meaning that the principles or conditions of both\nsubject and object are neither completely identical nor completely\ndifferent. As Hartmann reads it, Kant\u2019s principle is itself\nentirely \u201cthis side\u201d of the distinction between idealism\nand realism. In other words, it can be interpreted in the direction of\nplacing the conditions of experience inside the subject (Kant\u2019s\nidealist solution), or both within and beyond the subject in the world\n(a realist solution). Hartmann claims that Kant\u2019s idealistic\ninterpretation, which makes these conditions internal to the cognizing\n(transcendental) subject, results from a \u201cdogmatic\nprejudice.\u201d He believes that a solution that remains faithful to\nthe phenomena of cognition can be proposed that places the principles\nor conditions of experience not within the subject but within the\nwider reality of which both subject and object are parts. The at least\n\u201cpartial identity\u201d between subject and object which\nconditions the possibility of knowledge results from the fact that\nboth subject and object are determined by some shared ontological\nprinciples structurally superior to both. In other words, according to\nHartmann, in his explanation of valid a priori cognition,\nKant relied on a false dichotomy. Either representations are\ndetermined by the object, or the object is determined by\nrepresentations. Hartmann points out that this is not a complete\ndisjunction, and so is false. The third possibility is that both\nrepresentation and object are determined by a third factor, namely,\nprinciples that are valid for both subjects and objects. These\nprinciples are what Hartmann calls categories. The partial identity of\ncognitive and ontological categories, however, must be very carefully\ndelimited. This is the work of categorial analysis, the central task\nof ontology. Incidentally, many of Hartmann\u2019s responses to\nKantian idealism anticipate those of recent \u201cnew realists\u201d\nand \u201cspeculative realists\u201d by almost a century (Peterson\n2017a).\n\nThe methodology that Hartmann recommends reflects the critical stance.\nIn order to avoid precipitous standpoints, an unbiased philosophical\ninquiry moves through the three main stages of phenomenological,\naporetic and theoretical development. The first stage is descriptive\nand requires the systematic collection of all the available evidence\nrelevant to whatever is under scrutiny. Frequently, descriptions end\nup in conflicting theses, often in the form of aporias. More than\nanyone else, Hartmann rehabilitates the value of aporias (see\nSchlittmaier 2011 and Rescher 2011). Aporias themselves are\ninformative and should not be forced to disappear by fiat,\nsuch as an a priori assumption on the overall uniformity of\nreality or the assumption that we have a direct, transparent access to\nreality. The last phase of the philosophical method consists in using\nas few metaphysical assumptions as possible for the systematic\ntheoretical coordination of the results from the first two phases (ME,\nS). Metaphysical assumptions are necessary for the task of\nincorporating phenomena and aporias into a framework able to make\nsense of them. Since metaphysical assumptions are not directly\nsupported by descriptive data, it is advisable to keep them to a\nminimum, or to assume the weakest possible metaphysical\nassumptions.\n\nAn original way of distinguishing between ontology and metaphysics\nunderlies the third stage of theoretical development. Ontology, for\nHartmann, deals with what can be subsumed under at least partially\ncognizable categories, while metaphysics deals with the nonrational or\nnoncognizable. Two main consequences follow from this view of\nontology: firstly, ontology is primarily a theory of categories, in\nthe sense that all ontological distinctions have the form of\ncategories (AIntro1), and secondly, \u201cscience\u201d in all its\nbranches (including the human/social sciences) is ontological in all\nits ramifications (OLF37a), and is the most powerful ally of ontology.\nThis is rather at odds with the mainstream view of science as an\neminently epistemological affair (present in positivism,\nNeo-Kantianism, phenomenology, existentialism, postmodernism, etc.).\nThis is one of the issues on which Hartmann firmly departs from the\nNeo-Kantian legacy, as well as from the generalized critique of the\nnatural scientific approach in mainstream twentieth century\nContinental philosophy.\n\nThis methodology is already employed in the Metaphysics of\nCognition. A phenomenological description that extracts the\n\u201cessential features\u201d from the phenomenon of cognition\nwould note that: cognizers face off against something to-be-cognized;\nthey attempt to \u201cgrasp\u201d that something; they form an\n\u201cimage\u201d (broadly speaking) of that something; the image is\nsomehow \u201cdetermined\u201d by the something; that something is\nentirely untouched by the cognizer\u2019s attempt to grasp it; they\nmay or may not be in error about it (truth criterion); cognizers may\nbecome conscious of problems surrounding the something; and they may\nsucceed or fail in making cognitive progress regarding them (ME5a-i).\nFrom among these factors, take the central feature of\n\u201cgrasping.\u201d The phenomenon of grasping generates an\naporia: how does the mind go \u201cout of itself\u201d to grasp a\ntranscendent object? The sense of being faced with something that one\ndid not anticipate or create and that one must now \u201cgrasp\u201d\nis often simply backgrounded by antirealists who claim that the mind\nunconsciously creates its objects, or is imprisoned in a circle of its\nown \u201cpositings\u201d (ME6a). This is a\n\u201cskeptical-subjectivistic\u201d resolution to the aporia of\ngrasping that simply ignores rather than does justice to the\nphenomenon. It fails to distinguish between image and thing; what is\ncurrently \u201cobjectified\u201d in it; the object and the\n\u201ctransobjective\u201d (currently unknown but knowable); and\nwhat may even be \u201ctransintelligible\u201d (nonrational) in the\nthing. Only by retaining the Kantian distinction between object\n(appearance) and \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d can we account for this\ncentral phenomenon of grasping. Far from being irrelevant, Hartmann\nbelieves that the thing-in-itself is the \u201cfundamental and\neminently critical concept\u201d (ME30a). It is needed to explain the\nphenomenon of transcendence in the total phenomenon of cognition.\nProblem consciousness, which entails \u201cknowing that you\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d implicitly recognizes what is transobjective,\nand possibly transintelligible, in the thing. It implies a relation\nbetween the subject as existing knower and something existing\nindependently of it. The phenomenon of cognition overflows the domain\nof epistemology into ontology.\n\nThe mere fact (Faktum) that in problem consciousness and\ncognitive progress cognition ineluctably extends beyond its limits,\nand that problem consciousness does not stop at the limits of\ncognizability, forces us to realize that in general the ontological\ncharacter of the object overpowers the object-character of being,\ni.e., that ontological being in itself is concealed behind\ngnoseological being in itself (ME9f).\n\n\nIn other words, what problem consciousness entails is that objects are\nalways more than \u201can object for a subject,\u201d and even the\nnatural attitude toward the world takes this for granted. The burden\nof proof is thus on idealism to show that there is no such thing. This\nis in fact impossible, since even idealism assumes at the very least\nthat the cognizing subject is something \u201cin itself,\u201d\notherwise there is nothing but an infinite regress of representations\n(ME30b-c). The regress has to stop with something that\n\u201cis,\u201d and we need ontology to determine what this\nmeans.\n\nThe question of the section, \u201cWhat is the relation between\nthinking and being?\u201d, is thus answered by way of an extensive\nphenomenology, aporetics, and theory of cognition that clings to the\nbasic aspect of transcendence and grasping, debunking rationalist\npretensions to transparently cognize everything. It is not the case\nthat \u201cbeing is immanent to thinking,\u201d but that\n\u201cthinking is immanent to being.\u201d \u201cThis ontological\nimmanence has the simple meaning of total embeddedness of the\nrational in a larger sphere of the nonrational, in whose thoroughgoing\nrelations it is completely interwoven and in whose existing\ndeterminations it remains interwoven even where a consciousness of\nthese relations does not extend. It is the total embeddedness of\nthinking and of cognition as a whole in being\u201d (ME35d). It\nshould be noted that Heidegger also demoted cognition to secondary\nontological status in Being and Time (\u00a713, 1962 [1927]),\nand refers there to Hartmann\u2019s book.\n\nIn later work, the embeddedness of cognition in a wider network of\nsocial, affective, and practical activity is highlighted to an even\ngreater extent, and is further considered in the context of debates\nover universalism and relativism (or the contrast between\n\u201cscience\u201d and \u201cworldviews\u201d) (e.g.,\nAIntro9\u201311). Put simply, Hartmann embraces a nonreductive naturalistic\ninterpretation of humankind, recognizing cognition as an adaptive\nembodied transcendent act embedded in the context of other acts and\nontological relationships in the natural and social worlds (ELO). This\nperspective, including his interpretation of Kant explained above,\nmeans that our concepts of categories are human products, and are\nattempts to grasp stable ontological principles. As such our attempts\ncan be inadequate. Principles themselves may have nonrational\nelements, since they are transcendent objects too. The partial\nidentity between cognitive and ontological categories is rooted in\nbeing, rather than the mind alone, and persistent problems arise from\nhuman interaction with the world and each other.\n4. What is Valuable? What is the Place of Humankind in the World?\n4.1 Ethics\n\nBefore we can resolve fundamental problems regarding ethical norms,\nduties, rights, or happiness, Hartmann argues, we have to ask\n\u201cwhat is valuable?\u201d in the first place. The traditional\nmoral question \u201cwhat ought we to do?\u201d, posed by the\nKantian ethics of duty, presupposes the more fundamental axiological\nquestion, \u201cwhat is valuable in life and the world\ngenerally?\u201d (ET1Intro5) What is \u201cpractical\u201d about\nethics is not that it helps us find the means to reach ends, but that\nit helps us identify the ends of action themselves (ET1Intro3). These\nends are values. In the Ethics, the only book to be\ntranslated into English in his lifetime, Hartmann rejects the putative\nsubjectivism, formalism, and intellectualism of Kantian ethics, and\ndraws on Aristotelian virtue ethics for inspiration. Although he was\nmainly influenced by Max Scheler\u2019s Formalism in Ethics\n(1973 [1916]), which argues for a moral realism of values, Hartmann\ndeparts significantly from his approach in many ways (Kelly 2011a;\nR\u00f6mer 2012). Hartmann also responded to Nietzsche\u2019s call\nfor a \u201ctransvaluation\u201d of values, developed a typology of\ndistinctively Modern values out of Nietzsche\u2019s work, and defined\na moderate position between the extremes of value absolutism and value\nrelativism. Like his conception of problems, his conception of values\ncarefully distinguishes between the transhistorical and the\nhistorical.\n\nThe same kind of argument used in the previous work, which begins with\ncomplex \u201cfacts\u201d and reasons to their necessary conditions,\nis used in the Ethics. Hartmann held that the phenomena of\nmoral exemplarity, the idealization of moral types, the phenomena of\nself-criticism and accountability, conscience, and even the historical\ndominance of content-oriented virtue theory, all testify to an a\npriori, intuitive sense for values. But Hartmann does not erect\nan intuitionism of values out of this. A persistent theme throughout\nhis ethics is that morality is a creative enterprise, that it demands\na discerning sense for values and creative efforts at synthesis that\nengage the whole person. \u201cEthics applies itself to the creative\npower in man,\u201d he claims, and it awakens \u201cman\u2019s\ncreative, spontaneous, living sense of what ought to be, of what in\nitself is valuable\u201d (ET1Intro2). He repeatedly asserts that\nmoral life is life in the midst of conflicts of value, and that these\nconflicts are almost never cleanly resolved. \u201cReal moral life is\nnot such that one can stand guiltless in it. And that each person must\nstep by step in life settle conflicts, insoluble theoretically, by his\nown free sense of values and his own creative energy, should be\nregarded as a feature of the highest spiritual significance in\ncomplete humanity and genuine freedom\u201d (ET2 25b).\n\nWhile a novel axiology constitutes the core of Hartmann\u2019s\ninnovative approach, his treatment of the \u201cproblem of\nfreedom\u201d in the last part of the book is also as groundbreaking\nas it is unique. He dissects the problem of freedom and reveals\n\u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d to be a novel form of determination in\nthe world. Rejecting Scheler\u2019s \u201cmetaphysical\npersonalism\u201d as resting on a teleological prejudice, Hartmann\nconceives of human beings as meaning-makers who realize values in\naction. Their \u201cplace in the world\u201d is to bring values into\nreality which without them would otherwise remain unrealized (ET2\n11h). Elsewhere he states that \u201chumankind is the trustee\n(Sachwalter) of values and of the ought in the real world.\nHuman beings are the intermediary that implements them in\nactuality\u201d (S 40; P14f). Because aesthetic values and objects\nare some of the most meaningful and significant for human beings, he\nalso develops an extensive analysis of them in one of his final\nworks.\n\nOn reading the Ethics, the overall impression is of a kind of\ncautious optimism in face of an apathetic and pessimistic Modern\nculture. Hartmann was familiar with both Nietzsche\u2019s and\nScheler\u2019s critiques of ressentiment and Modern culture\n(Nietzsche 1989 [1887]; Scheler 1994 [1914]), but Hartmann believes\nthat the human sense for values can be cultivated, that we can learn\nto see the value abundance in the world and our relations to others\nagain, and that we can be creative actualizers of higher values in the\nworld. But to make this possible, what is first needed, counter to the\nlong ethical tradition, is to make the \u201ccentral task\u201d of\nethics \u201can analysis of the contents of values\u201d\n(ET1Foreword). Against the formalism and intellectualism of Kantian\nethics, it highlights the importance of our affective sense of values;\nagainst the relativism and subjectivism of Nietzsche, it shows that\nthere are universal features of value experience and a structure to\nthe domain of values which can give some guidance in prioritizing and\nsynthesizing values in conflict.\n\nValues, for Hartmann, are ideal entities. Mathematical entities and\nvalues \u201cexist\u201d in an atemporal way, and have their own\ndeterminations. In short, temporality is what radically distinguishes\nreal categories from ideal categories, and apart from temporality,\nindividuality is the second feature distinguishing real being from\nideal being. Everything ideal is general, and everything real is\nindividual. Everything real is unique and it exists only once. The\ngeneral in reality is real only \u201cin\u201d individuals (A37e).\nGiven the thesis that there are at least these two main types of ideal\nentities, what else is shared by the entities included in the sphere\nof ideal being? Hartmann considers the following three general\nfeatures. 1) The overall geography of both mathematical entities and\nvalues is unknown. The constant efforts of the best minds and the\naccumulated experience of humankind have been able to explore some of\ntheir territories, and partially to map their landmarks. The overall\nshape of mathematics and the overall shape of the territory of values,\nhowever, are far from being charted. 2) Both the region of\nmathematical entities and the region of values extend beyond the\nboundaries of real being. Many mathematical structures are far from\nbeing exemplified in reality and some will never be. The same patently\napplies to values. 3) Both mathematics and ethics claim universality.\nThis is part of their nature as ideal beings. On the other hand,\nneither mathematics nor ethics are able to capture\u2014from their\nown point of view\u2014the whole of reality. There is no single\nmathematical model of the world, and there are no good reasons to\nbelieve that there will ever be one. Similarly, there is no single\nethical understanding of the whole of human experience, and there are\nno good reasons to believe that there will ever be one. This last\nissue is especially important from an ontological point of view,\nbecause it shows that the universality of both mathematics and ethics\nis different from the universality of ontology (Poli 2009a,b).\n\nNevertheless, an analogous relation between the transhistorical and\nhistorical prevails here as in Hartmann\u2019s understanding of\nproblems, and, as we will see, in his understanding of categories.\nThere is a transhistorical content to values that is exemplified in\nvaried cultural and historical contexts and individual actions, in the\nsame way that there is a transhistorical problem content that is\naddressed by various thinkers in different places and times. In the\ncontext of the ethics, Hartmann employs the \u201cspotlight\u201d\nmetaphor to account for the shifting structure of value preferences\nand value consciousness in different times and places, while\nvalue-contents themselves are unchanging. From the whole realm of\nvalues, value consciousness \u201ccuts out a little circle of\nsomething seen\u201d and this circle \u201cwanders about\u201d the\nideal realm of values (ET1 6a; AE27e; Cadwallader 1984). Human beings\nhave affective access to the full range of values, but their cultural\nethos only presents them with a limited selection of this range. The\nindividual capacity to \u201csee\u201d values also changes with age\nand axiological maturity. Groups and communities change by following\ndifferent guiding values. This latter case shows how historical and\nsocial conditions are at work in shaping the territory of accessible\nvalues. The interplay between individuals and the groups to which they\nbelong finds moments of stability in the mutually adjusted selection\nof shared values. Repeated acts of valuation tend to produce stable or\nfixed orders of individual and social preferences, or ethos,\nwhose guiding values press to be realized. The current\n\u201cmaintenance-loss\u201d model of language acquisition (Black et\nal. 1998)\u2014which basically means \u201cuse it or lose\nit\u201d\u2014would also seem to apply in the case of cultural value\npreferences and patterns of valuation. New visions and corresponding\nbehaviors can be rejected, or they may occasionally be accepted and\ncontribute to behaviors shaped by different values.\n\nThe second part of Hartmann\u2019s massive tome is comprised of an\nextensive survey of western values, including ancient Greek,\nChristian, and Modern values. Valuational conditions in the subject,\nour sense of agency, and environmental values form the prerequisites\nfor the lasting fulfillment of genuinely moral values. The elementary\nconditions in the subject are life, consciousness, and personality.\nThe last of these contains a number of values within itself: activity,\nsuffering, strength, freedom, foresight, and purposefulness (ET2\n11a-h). The elementary conditions in the object are the goods and\nsituational values, such as environmental conditions, the causal\nnexus, material possessions, community and family, and social goods\n(law, language, knowledge, education, and\n\u201cfree-association\u201d). Goods and situations are not moral\nvalues, but they are morally relevant, and are the conditions of\nhaving moral values at all (ET2 12a-g).\n\nPurposefulness in a way sums up the other conditions in the subject,\nand also designates a structure of ontological determination unique to\nhumankind, which Hartmann calls the \u201cfinalistic nexus.\u201d\nOur purposefulness is what allows us \u201cto actualize values which\nwithout our help would remain unreal\u201d (ET2 11h), and it\nstructures all forms of practical intention, from striving and willing\nto hoping and taking on attitudes. He defines the finalistic nexus as\na three-part structure: 1) affirming or setting up the end in\nanticipation (which presupposes values and value perception); 2)\nworking backwards from the end to the nearest means leading up to it,\nand so on, back to the first step; 3) actualizing the end through the\nseries of means in the real temporal and causal order (ET1 20c). In\nthis analysis, finalism is not something opposed to causality, but\nobviously requires causality, and this \u201cplus\u201d of\ndetermination inserts itself into the many-layered causal series.\nNaturalism misunderstands this because it fails to see purposefulness\nproperly as noncausal (ET1 20e). The significance of this analysis of\nfinalism is decisive for his ethics and philosophical anthropology in\ngeneral, especially in the discussion of freedom of the will, and is\nalso important because it forms the basis for the critique of\nteleological metaphysics that Hartmann embraces from the beginning to\nthe end of his career.\n\nThe core of his axiological analysis focuses on moral values in the\nwestern ethical tradition. He considers a handful of general or\nfundamental values, including the good, the noble, richness of\nexperience, and purity, before launching into more detailed analyses\nof three historically dominant clusters of values stemming from\nancient Greek, Christian, and Modern morality, all of which continue\nto carry normative force today. In the Greek group, Hartmann covers\njustice, wisdom, courage, and self-control, and discusses\nAristotle\u2019s theory of the mean with reference to values such as\ngenerosity, ambition, and magnanimity. The core value of the Christian\ngroup of values is brotherly love. This kind of love is directed at\nwhomever is nearest, to the other person as person (ET2 24a).\nTruthfulness, reliability, faith, modesty, and humility are other\nvalues that fall in this group. In contrast to these historical\nclusters, there are also values associated with the impulse to\ntransform them, turning against comfort, tradition, and inertia,\nexhibiting a striving for progress, chasing ideals that go beyond the\nlife of the individual. It is hard to name some values in this third\ngroup because they are so new, but Hartmann calls the first value\n\u201clove of the remotest,\u201d following Nietzsche. It is love\nfor the ideal of humankind as it should be, and knows that ignoring\nthis ideal is wrong. Radiant virtue (Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201cschenkende Tugend\u201d; see Nietzsche 2006) is\nconnected to the present. It is the sense of spiritual fullness,\nimparting to others spiritual goods, an overflowing ability to share,\nto broadcast values, and the delight in so doing.\n\u201cPersonality\u201d is the sense that each person has a unique\ncharacter and complex ideal personality that they \u201cought\u201d\nto approximate as best they can. It is a new norm for the person. The\nsingularity of personal behavior is as much an \u201cought\u201d as\nis the universal ought. His descriptions and discussions of many of\nthe values considered central to western morality, especially of the\nModern ethos (ET2 30e-33f), are fascinating and worth sustained\nattention.\n\nHartmann also discusses the structure of the value realm that we can\ndiscern, even if we cannot map it in its entirety. Two organizing\nprinciples of the value domain are especially important: that of\nstrength and that of height. The strength of a value is indicated by\nthe gravity of its violation, while the height of a value is expressed\nin the merit deriving from its fulfillment. These two principles\noperate in opposite directions: the strongest values are also the\nlowest values, while the highest values are the least strong ones.\nUsually, lower values are simpler (that is, they possess less\nintuitable content) while higher values are more complex. The laws of\nstrength and height have significant consequences, the two most\nimportant of which are the following: 1) violating a lower value is a\nmore serious offense than violating a higher value; 2) fulfilling a\nhigher value is a greater good than fulfilling a lower value. In\nHartmann\u2019s words, \u201csinning against lower values is\nignominious, shameful, revolting, but their fulfillment only reaches\nthe level of decency, without rising above it. Offending against\nhigher values, by contrast, does indeed have the character of moral\nfailure, but nothing of the directly degrading, while fulfillment of\nthese values may have something uplifting, liberating, indeed\nthrilling about it\u201d (ET2 28e). Offending against life is a grave\noffense, while respecting it has very little merit. But the\nfulfillment of spiritual goods is a merit much greater than the merit\ncorresponding to respect for more elementary goods, such as\nenvironmental goods. If the architecture of values is based on levels\nof dependence, then the ethos of a person whose behavior is oriented\nto a higher value, but who does not simultaneously respect the values\nthat support it, is structurally discordant. The higher values to\nwhich she refers are not sustainable. Loving with distrust or giving\nwith cowardice are not authentically virtuous behaviors (ET2 63f). A\npattern of valuation is constructed step by step from the most\nelementary levels upwards.\n\nValue antinomies and conflicts also structure the domain of values.\nSome typical conflicts include that between justice, which demands the\nsame treatment for all, and personal love, which demands special\ntreatment for one individual. The value of personality stands in\nantinomic relation to universal values like justice and brotherly\nlove, both of which demand a certain kind of equality. There are\nvarious forms of contrast, not just antinomy proper. The clash between\nuniversal and personal, and between present and future are others, and\nin a way all values conflict with each other in concrete situations\n(ET2 36g). In light of these clashes, a frequent source of error is\nfetishizing one value at the expense of others, leading to the tyranny\nof a single value. Fanaticism of justice which attacks love,\nfanaticism of love which leads to self-sacrifice, fanaticism of love\nof the remote which becomes a hatred of the present (Nietzsche) are\nsome typical cases. In a way, every value taken to an extreme is a\ndanger, so avoiding extremes through synthesis is crucial. \u201cOnly\na sense of justice which is at the same time loving, only a brotherly\nlove which also considers the far distant, only a pride which would\nlikewise be humble, could be valid as an ideal of moral conduct\u201d\n(ET2 36g). He goes so far as to say that values reach fulfillment only\nin synthesis with others.\n\nThe ever-present conflicts of values are also a condition of personal\nfreedom, because no decision would be needed if there were no conflict\n(ET3 16e). Hartmann\u2019s analysis of freedom covers the various\nsenses of autonomy exposed by Kant\u2019s ethical theory, but adds\nanother layer that responds directly to the problem of value conflict.\nBecause the actual ethical existence of the person is\n\u201chigher\u201d than values, freedom is incompatible with\ncomplete determination of the person by a higher\nprinciple\u2014whether god, duty, or even values (ET3 16f). Freedom\ncannot bear the form of an ought at all. Interestingly, Hartmann was\nclear about this long before Sartre. Freedom has to be regarded as a\nplus of determination in face both of natural law and of moral law,\nontological and axiological determination (ET3 16g). By our actual\ninitiative we decide actual conflicts, and \u201cpersonal\nautonomy\u201d is the person\u2019s capacity to endorse values, to\ntransform a value into one\u2019s own determinant, to commit or not\nto commit oneself to a value, and values are impotent without our\ncommitment to them. We are the mediators of the ought in reality, and\nonly personal commitment to them can bring them to actualization (ET3\n17c). This explicitly opposes any simple intuitionism about\nvalues.\n\nAs readers may have noted, this position on freedom resonates with\nlater existentialist thinking, and like it, levelled devastating\narguments against any form of metaphysics that imposed any form of\ndetermination on humankind. Hartmann\u2019s critique of teleological\nmetaphysics is one example of this (ET1 21b-d). The anthropomorphic\nroots of cosmic teleology stem from our own purposefulness. Its\nanthropomorphism is philosophically expressed in the assertion of the\nprimacy of axiological determination in the universe over ontological\ndetermination. While the finalistic nexus is a phenomenon of our\nstructure, it cannot be generalized to the structure of the universe,\nor we would overturn the basic ontological structure of the real\nworld, and this \u201cmetaphysical humanization of the Absolute is\nthe moral annulment of man\u201d (ET3 21d). Hartmann claims that if\nthe cosmos were teleologically oriented toward the good, then there\nwould be no place for what makes humankind unique in it. Hartmann\nconsiders \u201cdeliverance from the nightmare of teleology\u201d to\nbe one of the chief accomplishments of Modern philosophy, because with\nsuch a metaphysics genuine morality becomes impossible (ET3 5e). By\nrestricting finalism to its proper place, ethics rehabilitates\nhumankind, recognizing its limited but also weighty cosmic\nsignificance.\n4.2 Aesthetics\n\nIf the \u201cplace\u201d of humankind is to give meaning to the\nworld, then meaning-giving through the arts has to be examined. In the\narts, humankind achieves some of its most significant instances of\nendowing the world with meaning. Hartmann says that \u201cthe\nbestowal of meaning that comes into human life via aesthetic values\nconsists fundamentally in nothing other than in the convincing feeling\nof standing face-to-face before something of absolutely intrinsic\nvalue\u2014before something for whose sake alone it would be worth\nliving, regardless of how the conditions of one\u2019s life stand\notherwise\u201d (AE35b).\n\nAs in the ethics and epistemology, one of the main features of\nHartmann\u2019s aesthetics is its close interplay with ontology.\nHartmann intentionally focuses his aesthetics on the problem of the\naesthetic object, and sets aside investigation of the correlated acts.\nHartmann distinguishes two \u201cstrata\u201d in the aesthetic\nobject, which he calls the foreground and the background. In his\nwords, \u201cthe aesthetics of today still concentrates mainly on\nanalysis of the act, and this is why the stratification relationship\n[in the object], although it has often been noted, is not yet familiar\nto it\u201d (P47a). The foreground is comprised of the real, concrete\nand sensible dimensions of the object, everything that is independent\nof the presence of a subject who beholds the object and seeks to\nunderstand it. The background strata vary with the kinds of content\nthe foreground lets appear, and the background exists only for the\nsubject who grasps it. This level is typically organized into many\ndistinct sub-levels. A theory of this kind obviously raises two\nquestions: first, how do we articulate the relationship between the\ntwo levels? Second, how do we articulate the relationship among the\nsublevels of the background stratum? In response to the first\nquestion, Hartmann describes a \u201crelationship of\nappearance\u201d on the basis of which\u2014as has been pointed out\non innumerable occasions\u2014the foreground (i.e., the matter of the\nobject) imposes constraints on the background. Most important for the\ndefinition of aesthetic values is to realize that these values attach\nto the \u201crelation of appearance\u201d itself. In other words,\nthe aesthetic values that fall under the general heading of\n\u201cbeauty\u201d are defined as values that are carried by the\n\u201cappearance relation\u201d that emerges between some materially\nexisting \u201cforeground\u201d of the object and some unreal\n\u201cbackground\u201d that exists only for the beholder. The skill\nof the artist consists in manipulating this relation of appearance.\nAesthetic values are different from moral or vital values in that they\ndo not attach to an existing thing, but exist only for a subject who\nappreciates aesthetically; they are values of the object as\n(intentional) object, independently of reality or unreality; they are\ntied to the relation of appearance itself; and they are values\nspecific to each object and unique to it (AE4c). In all cases, values\nlike beauty, the sublime, the graceful, charming, idyllic, or sweet,\nas well as all species of the comical, such as farce, the ridiculous,\nfunny, and humorous, are tied to the relation of appearance and\nspecific to each object. Notably, Hartmann completely revises\nKant\u2019s definition of the sublime, detaching it from the\ntranscendental, the realm of the quantitative, and the oppressive, and\nimplants it into the natural and human, terrestrial and nearby, fixing\nit in the object and a \u201cpsychic need of the human heart\u201d\n(AE31b). It is rooted in the \u201cattraction of the human heart to\nwhat is magnificent\u201d (AE31c), and our human desire to bring\nmeaning into life. The sublime is a form of beauty that responds to\nthe human need for greatness. \u201cIt is that specific appearing of\nan unsensed background in a real sensed foreground of the object,\nwhich accommodates the needs of man for greatness, and, with the\ngreatest ease, overcomes any resistance opposed to it\u201d (AE31c).\nIt is also noteworthy that Hartmann treats both comedy and music at\nfar greater length in the Aesthetics than most other authors\nof comparable works in the history of philosophy.\n\nThat part of the theory which concerns the typical stratification of\nthe background is completely original. In response to the second\nquestion above, the answer is that different aesthetic objects display\ndifferent articulations of the background stratum. In the case of\nliterary works, for example, Hartmann distinguishes at least six\ndifferent levels for more sophisticated genres like epic narratives or\nnovels, while other genres have fewer levels. This applies to lyrical\npoems, for example, whose expressiveness is articulated into fewer\nlevels because of the constraints imposed on the admissible expressive\nforms. Hartmann cites the portrait as an example of a visual aesthetic\nobject. He distinguishes the following levels in its background\nstratum: the three-dimensional space in which the subject of the\nportrait and some elements of the setting appear; the movement of the\nsubject\u2019s apparent corporeality; the subject\u2019s character;\ntheir individual idea, or the idea that the person portrayed has of\nthemselves; the symbolic, or the universal content manifested by the\nportrait. His discriminating and extensive analyses of works by\nBeethoven, Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Rembrandt, among many others, are\nworthy of close consideration by theorists, as is the entire\ntheory.\n\nAs in the ethics, Hartmann again reminds readers of what the analysis\nteaches us about the place of humankind in the world. \u201cIf man\nwith his powers, his sense of values, and his occasional capacity for\nrealizing values, is capable of bestowing meaning and value, then\nprecisely the senselessness of the world as a whole obtains a meaning\nfor him. [\u2026] A world that, without man, was already filled with\nmeaning would render him superfluous even despite his gifts for\nbestowing meaning\u201d (AE35a). Both the ethics and aesthetics\nentail a unique philosophical anthropology that inserts humankind into\nthe complex stratified structure of the world.\n4.3 Anthropology\n\nFischer has argued that Hartmann should be counted among the members\nof a \u201cCologne Constellation\u201d of thinkers whose main\nproject was the development of a philosophical anthropology that\ncombined serious reflection on human being as a biological creature\nwith the findings of the human sciences and humanities (Fischer 2012).\nMax Scheler, Helmuth Plessner (1892\u20131985), Hartmann, and later, Arnold\nGehlen (1904\u20131976), are included in this group. They all shared the\ndesire to bridge the dualism between natural scientific and humanistic\naccounts (Scheler 1928, Plessner 1928, Gehlen 1940). They knew each\nother\u2019s work, and their mutual influences remain to be\ndisentangled. While Hartmann did not write a book devoted to\nphilosophical anthropology, his ideas on the topic are scattered\nthroughout a number of works, including The Problem of Spiritual\nBeing (1933), OLF (1935), a long review of Gehlen\u2019s book\n(1941), and \u201cNaturphilosophie und Anthropologie\u201d (1944).\nCharacteristically, Hartmann\u2019s view rejects both reductive\nnaturalistic accounts as well as the anthropocentric exceptionalism\nthat characterizes many idealist humanistic views. In The Problem\nof Spiritual Being, Hartmann explains that the category of the\n\u201cspirit\u201d is divided into personal, objective and\nobjectivated spirit. Personal spirit is the spirit of the individual;\nobjective spirit is the living spirit of communities; and objectivated\nspirit characterizes the products of spirit. As he also explained in\nthe Ethics, the categorial features of personal spirit are\nconsciousness, will, foresight and teleological activity. None of\nthese features pass to objective spirit. There is no consciousness\napart from individual consciousness, and the same applies to the other\ncapacities. He thus rejects the idealist conception of a unifying\nabsolute spirit. In order to ward off materialist reductionism, he\nembraces a nonreductive naturalism that acknowledges the ontological\ndependence of higher functions on lower processes without detriment to\nthe autonomy and novelty of the higher. He carefully works to\nreconcile the disparate facets of the human phenomenon, such as the\nfact that human beings are vanishing specks of dust in a vast cosmos\nas well as the only beings capable of creating masterpieces of art\nthat give meaning to the world. Human beings are ontologically\nstratified creatures, including physical, biological, mental, and\nspiritual features that reflect the stratified structure of reality.\nHartmann\u2019s anthropological ideas have gotten a good deal of\nattention in recent research (Kalckreuth et al. 2019; Hartung and\nWunsch 2014), and could also form an intriguing starting point for\ncomparison between Hartmann and other writers, such as McDowell\n(Wunsch 2020). The nature of the stratified ontology of the real world\non which it is based remains to be explained.\n5. What is the Structure of the Real World?\n\nHartmann claims in Ontology: Laying the Foundations\n(1935) that the book \u201cform[s] the prelude to an ontology that I\nhave been working on for two decades,\u201d and that \u201c[a] new\ncritical ontology has become possible. The task is to make it a\nreality\u201d (v). The book paved the way for a systematic treatment\nof ontology by introducing (1) the difference between modes of being\n(the modalities of possibility, necessity and actuality), spheres of\nbeing (real and ideal), and ways of being (Dasein and\nSosein), as well as (2) a treatment of emotional transcendent\nacts as constituting the requisite pre-conceptual acquaintance with\nthe harshness of reality. The main thesis put forward by Hartmann in\nLaying the Foundations is that all ontological\ndifferences are categorial articulations of being, not differences\nbetween being and non-being. Parts and wholes are both authentic\naspects of being; independent and dependent entities are similarly\naspects of being; physical, biological, psychological and spiritual\ntypes of being are all manifestations of being, and none of them is\n\u201cmore being\u201d than any other. From the point of view of\nontology, no part, aspect, or moment of reality is \u201cmore\nbeing\u201d than any other part, aspect or moment of it. The fact\nthat, say, the existence of biological entities depends on that of\nphysical entities does not imply that physics is \u201cmore\nontologically real\u201d than biology. Existentially dependent\nentities are as ontologically genuine as existentially independent\nones. This basic premise is one of the points of departure for his\nontological pluralism. All entities, whatever their type, demand the\nsame careful ontological scrutiny. Hartmann\u2019s analytic\ndevelopment of ontology begins with the theory of ontological\nmodalities elaborated in Possibility and Actuality. The main\npurpose of this book is to demonstrate that modalities ground the\ndifferences between the two principal spheres of being (real and\nideal) and the two secondary spheres of being (knowledge and logic).\nFinally, The Structure of the Real World and Philosophy\nof Nature present in detail the many fundamental and special\ncategories within the real sphere of being.\n\nGiven his unique reading of Kant, \u201ccategories\u201d become the\ncentral theme of Hartmann\u2019s ontology. Hartmann\u2019s theory of\ncategories entirely breaks with Kant\u2019s or Hegel\u2019s theories\nof categories by explicitly denying that categories are concepts.\nWhile we need concepts in order to refer to categories, concepts never\ncapture categories entirely, just as our \u201cimages\u201d of\nobjects never capture \u201cwhat exists\u201d entirely.\n\nCategories deal with what is universal and necessary (AIntro12).\nCategories articulate in particular the Sosein\n(\u201cbeing-such-and-such-a-way\u201d) of entities; they specify\nconfigurations, structures and contents, not forms of existence\n(AIntro7). Categories specify the fundamental determinations of being,\nand are \u201cprinciples\u201d of being. As fundamental\ndeterminations of being, categories form the interior of entities, so\nto speak. In this sense, categories are immanent to the world, and do\nnot form a second world (A16b). The categorial interior of entities\ncan be viewed in terms of a core-periphery organization: the most\nfundamental categories structure the innermost core of entities, while\nother categories, such as scientific ones, add progressively more\nsuperficial layers. Ontological categories are the most fundamental,\nand form the network of internal, dynamic determinants and\ndependencies which articulate the furniture and structure of the\nworld. Categories do not form a homogeneous continuum, but appear to\nbe organized in groups (AIntro15). Some categories belong to all the\nspheres of being (ideal and real), some to the entire real world,\nothers to a specific stratum of reality. The first group of\ncategories, \u201cmodal categories,\u201d is analyzed in detail in\nPossibility and Actuality; the second group,\n\u201cfundamental categories,\u201d is covered in The Structure\nof the Real World, while the third group, \u201cspecial\ncategories,\u201d is explored in the Philosophy of Nature\nand other works. Fundamental categories include (1) categories\norganized in pairs of opposites, such as principle-concretum,\nelement-complex, and form-matter; (2) strata categories, such\nas those that distinguish inanimate, living, psychological, and\nspiritual beings; and (3) the categories of intercategorial\nconnections, or the group of categorial laws, such as the\nlaws of coherence, stratification, and dependence among\ncategories.\n\nWe come to know ontological categories through the objects that we\ncome to know. However, our knowledge of ontological categories is even\nmore provisional than our knowledge of objects. The difference between\nknowing objects and knowing categories explains why ontological\ncategories are often confused with concepts. The problem is that\ncategories do not allow direct acquaintance as objects do. Concepts\nare names of ontological categories, which implies that concepts are\npartial, static, separate representations of items that in themselves\nare both essentially dynamic and inseparable from other ontological\ncategories. Like the knowledge of objects, the knowledge of\nontological categories also changes\u2014when ontology develops, our\nunderstanding of ontological categories develops as well, so that we\ngain a deeper and better grasp of their articulation and subtleties.\nSome categories have countless variations, others only a few minor\nones. The most general and schematic categories are those with the\nmost meager content, and they are therefore those that change least\n(A27b).\n\nThe two main aspects of categories are their generality and their\ncharacter of determination. This second feature is what makes them\nprinciples. Principles exhaust themselves in this determining role.\nThey only exist for something else; they are something only with\nrespect to the concretum that they determine and are\nin. Principles are nothing without their concretum,\nand the concretum cannot exist without its principles (A1a;\n6b; 16b; and elsewhere). The ontological aspect of the categories\nconsists in some kind of determination of their concreta.\nCategories as principles are independent from their concreta,\nbut not from other categories (A11c). Principles imply one another,\nand all the categories characterizing a stratum of reality work\ntogether (A15c). Categories are far from being the only principles of\nentities. There are also highly particular principles structuring\nspecific domains of being\u2014such as natural laws or psychological\nlaws\u2014which are concreta with respect to general\ncategories (A25f). There is a gradation of principles from the most\ngeneral categories to specific real cases. Empirical laws are\nconcreta with respect to general principles, and they are\nprinciples with respect to individual instances.\n5.1 Fundamental Categories\n\nAmong fundamental categories, paired categories are the most general\nstructural elements of being. As structural elements they\nhave content, and there are composite relations among them (A23b).\nHartmann organizes the various pairs into two groups of six pairs,\nwithout claiming that the list of paired oppositions is exhaustive.\nThe first group includes principle-concretum,\nstructure-modus, form-matter, inner-outer, determination-dependence,\nquality-quantity; the second group includes unity-manifoldness,\nharmony-conflict, opposition-dimension, discreteness-continuity,\nsubstratum-relation, element-complex. There is no intrinsic order\namong the pairs (A24a). It is apparent that some of these are easier\nto grasp than others. To provide a sample of Hartmann\u2019s\nanalysis, we now briefly describe two of the pairs,\nprinciple-concretum and element-complex (for more details see\nWerkmeister 1990, Poli 2011a, and A sections).\n\nPrinciple-Concretum: Concretum for Hartmann\nis what is determinate, that in which categories are embedded as their\ndeterminations. The concretum is not limited to real\nentities, but includes ideal ones as well. Furthermore, the\nconcretum for Hartmann is not to be understood as limited to\nthe individual instances of a principle because there can be different\nlevels of concreta. For instance, strata categories are\nconcreta with respect to general categories. In this case,\nboth the concretum and its principles are categories. Real\ncategories contain all the universal determinations of their\nconcreta; they contain what is needed for the structure of\nthe concreta. A complete system of categories\u2014not the\nincomplete one we are able to grasp\u2014completely determines its\nconcreta (A4a). As natural laws exist only in the real\nprocesses of nature and are nothing outside of them, so real\ncategories exist only as structural relations within the real world\nand are nothing in themselves (A16c). The principle-concretum\nform of determination is only one among a variety of types of\ndetermination, and in no way is it the most relevant in the real\nworld. In fact, each real level has its own specific types of\ndetermination, such as the specific linear nexus (causal, final, etc.)\nthat unifies the phases of the processes that unfold within and\nbetween concreta. In sum, principles are that through which\nthe concretum is (partially) grasped. They are the\narchai of the concretum, the condition of its\npossibility or that on which the concretum rests. They have\nunconstrained validity for all the concreta that fall within\ntheir range (A27c).\n\nElement-complex: Complexes are relational entities. In\nPhilosophy of Nature, Hartmann explains that he prefers the\nterm \u201ccomplex\u201d (Gef\u00fcge) to the \u201cworn\nout\u201d (verbrauchten) term \u201csystem\u201d (N38c).\nThe elements of a complex are its members, not substrata, and elements\nare determined by the complex of which they are members (A25c).\nComplexes have their own type of determination, and in each case the\ndetermination extends across the complex\u2019s elements and\ntransforms them. A complex of elements is always a complex of\nrelations and determinations. Elements are essentially determined by\nthe positions they occupy within the complex\u2019s total series of\nrelations (A33a). This explains why elements have functions within the\ncomplex. Within a complex, what matters are not the elements, but the\nrelations that they maintain among themselves and with the complex. An\nirregularly shaped stone, a grain of sand, a puddle, a mountain are\nnot independent complexes, but fragments and parts of larger\nformations that come into existence before them and within which they\nexist as subordinate moments (A33c). All natural complexes are\ncomplexes of forces and processes, but physical complexes and\norganisms are different. The inside of the complex of processes that\nconstitutes an organism is the capacity of the complex to maintain its\nworking conditions\u2014what Hartmann calls the self-determination of\nthe organism (A34c), while a physical complex maintains its dynamic\nstability through equilibrium with its exterior.\n\nReaders might have noted that while the principle-concretum pair seems\nto cover some of the terrain of the old distinction between essence\nand existence, it does not entirely coincide with it. Hartmann\nrejected those terms in favor of a more accurate distinction between\nSosein (\u201cbeing-such-and-such-a-way\u201d) and\nDasein as \u201cways of being.\u201d Dasein and\nSosein can be approximately understood as existence and\ndetermination. Both real and ideal entities have both Sosein\nand Dasein. Mathematical entities and values\n\u201cexist\u201d in an atemporal way, for example, and have their\nown determinations. While the general is a dominant category in the\nideal sphere and a subordinate category in the sphere of the real,\nindividuality is a category of the sphere of real being only. In the\nrealm of ideal being there is no individual. Ultimately, what\nrigorously distinguishes the real from the ideal spheres themselves\nare the different \u201cintermodal relations\u201d of necessity,\npossibility, and actuality in each. In Possibility and\nActuality, a book which still awaits close scrutiny by\nresearchers, Hartmann argues for some of his most startling\nclaims.\n\nRejecting the Aristotelian notion of \u201cpartial possibility\u201d\non which most conceptions of possibility are based, Hartmann embraces\na \u201cMegarian\u201d conception of \u201creal possibility.\u201d\nHartmann examines the differences between \u201creal\npossibility\u201d and \u201cessential [or ideal] possibility,\u201d\n\u201creal necessity\u201d and \u201cessential [or ideal]\nnecessity,\u201d among others, and argues that paradoxically the\npossible, the actual, and the necessary coincide in the real world\n(Hartmann 2017 [1937]; PA16b-c). In other words, the real world is\nfully determinate, and whatever is possible is possible within the\nbounds of the actual world. (Peruzzi 2001 considers the relation\nbetween Hartmann\u2019s view of modality and \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d semantics.)\n\nThe ways of being Sosein and Dasein are also in a\nsense relative, or positional. Hartmann presents their positional\nalternation this way: the Dasein of a tree is the\nSosein of a forest (OLF19a); i.e., without the existing tree\nthe content of the forest would be different. Similarly, the\nDasein of the branch is the Sosein of the tree, the\nDasein of the leaf is the Sosein of the branch, and\nthe Dasein of the vein is the Sosein of the leaf.\nThings can be inverted, too: the Sosein of the leaf is the\nDasein of the vein; the Sosein of the branch is the\nDasein of the leaf, etc. The Dasein-Sosein\nseries has two limits: towards the first, original Dasein and\ntowards the last Sosein, the Sosein of the whole of\nreality. The mainstream interpretation of Dasein and\nSosein, or existence and essence, as entirely\nseparate aspects of being, depends on epistemological acts of\nisolation. Only when aspects are separated do independent substances\nand dependent qualities appear, and it is for this reason that it\nseems that qualities do not have any Dasein and,\ncomplementarily, that their bearers have no Sosein (OLF20c).\nThis is just one of the novel and transformative findings in\nHartmann\u2019s ontological analysis that overcomes difficulties with\nthe traditional contrast between essence and existence.\n5.2 Strata\n\nThese are only some of the fundamental categories and articulations\nthat structure the real world. It is not just the theory of\ncategories, but the theory of strata (\u201clevels of reality\u201d)\nthat distinguishes Hartmann\u2019s ontology. Like everything else,\nstrata of reality are characterized by their categories. By\ndefinition, the categories characterizing strata of reality are not\ngeneral, in the sense that they do not pertain to reality in its\nentirety, but only to specific domains of real being. On the other\nhand, fundamental categories are the most general and simple\ncategories, and for this reason they are contained in the special\ncategories of all of the strata (A21b). Strata are the true\nstructuring framework of the real world. While the latter has unity,\nits unity is the unity of neither a principle nor a center. The unity\nof the real world is instead provided by the structure and order of\nthe strata (A52a).\n\nFour main strata of reality are distinguished by Hartmann: the\ninanimate, the biological, the psychological or mental, and the\nspiritual. This last includes all historical realities (history,\nlanguage, customs, law, art, etc.). The underlying observation is that\nthe structure and the laws of history and other spiritual processes\nare different from the structure and laws of, say, inanimate beings,\nbut the former are not in any way less real than the latter (A20a).\nThe same applies to the other strata as well: biological and\npsychological processes are as real as any other process, and they\nhave their own specific groups of categories. Ontology must be\npluralistic.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Hartmann\u2019s theory of\nstrata is the question of what kinds of relation connect the strata to\neach other. Two general relations seem to govern strata relations, and\nthese are further specified by the \u201ccategorial laws.\u201d The\ntwo basic relations between strata are termed relations of\nsuperformation (\u00dcberformung) and superposition\n(\u00dcberbauung) (A51f). Consider the superformation between\nmolecules and cells, i.e., between the physical and the biological\nlevels of reality. It accounts for the fact that even if organisms are\nunquestionably more complex than mechanisms, the behavior of organisms\nis in conformity with laws of mechanics (A51b). At the same time,\nmechanical regularities are superformed by being incorporated into\norganic ones. The relation between the psychological and spiritual\nlevels is different, because they are characterized by an interruption\nin the categorial series and by the onset of a new categorial\ncoherence. The relations between the biological and the psychological\nstratum, on the one hand, and the relation between the psychological\nand the spiritual stratum, on the other, are both relations of\nsuperposition. The group of categories embedded in psychological\nentities is different from the group of categories embedded in\nbiological entities. Similarly, the group of categories embedded in\nspiritual entities is different from the group of categories embedded\nin psychological entities.\n\nHartmann specifies analytically the laws that govern the various\nlevels of reality and their connection (for a short introduction see\nNW; for a summary of the laws, see Poli 2011a and Peterson 2012). The\nlaws of validity concern the scope of the validity of\ncategorial principles (A43a), and the laws of coherence\nconcern the holistic character of each stratum (A45b). If we take a\nsimple organism as object of inquiry, for example, biological\ncategories rather than physical or mental ones are primarily valid,\nand these saturate the organism with specifically organological forms\nof determination, no more (such as teleology) and no less (such as\nphysical causality). Moreover, if we claim that metabolism belongs to\na proper understanding of the organism, then aspects of every other\ncategory of organic life are entailed in it as well, codetermining and\ningredient in it. With these two sets of principles, he has covered\nthe internal coherence and determination within a stratum. These laws\ntogether imply a degree of incommensurability of categorial domains to\none another, but given the all-pervasiveness of the fundamental\ncategories, this substantive incommensurability is never total.\nRelations between different strata are captured in the last two sets\nof structural laws.\n\nThe laws of stratification can be summed up in four key\nterms: recurrence, modification, novelty, and distance. Some lower\ncategories recur in higher strata as partial aspects of higher\ncategories, and every recurring category is modified in its\nrecurrence. Whenever a lower element is taken into the higher it is\naffected by its new place in relation to others in the new stratum.\nThese two principles constitute a vertical interconnectedness of the\nstrata. While the categories of causality and substance, for example,\nappear to us initially in discussion of physical things, they recur\nmodified in the domain of the organic. Because categories are not\nsimples but complexes of factors, some of those factors may remain\nstable while others are modified, constituting the recurrence of the\nsame but non-identical category. These recurrences have to be shown in\neach case, and one of the tasks of categorial analysis is tracing the\nmodifications of a single category throughout the strata. Next, every\nstratum contains is own unique and novel categories that are not\npresent in the lower stratum, nor are they a sum of them. Finally,\nrecurrence, modification, and novelty imply that there is not a\ncontinuous series of levels, but gaps or incisions between them. The\nlast two laws of novelty and distance are what give the impression of\nthe ontological irreducibility of the strata (A50b). For instance,\nwhile the category of metabolism in the organic may necessarily\nincorporate some aspects of linear causal process, it is itself a\ndistinctive kind of process that is irreducible to them. Thus,\nrecurrence and novelty respectively reflect the aspects of continuity\nand discontinuity among the strata. Categorial novelty inserts an\nincision or cut into the apparent continuum of categories, creating a\ndistance or gap between strata. The laws of dependence can\nalso be summed up in four terms: strength, indifference, matter, and\nfreedom. The \u201cfundamental categorial law\u201d of strength says\nthat the lower categories on which higher strata depend are conditions\nor fundaments, while the higher are weaker. The lower are indifferent\nto whether anything higher builds on them or not, since their vocation\nis not to serve the higher. As \u201cmatter,\u201d the lower\ncategories, if incorporated into higher levels, constrain what the\nhigher may do with them but do not determine it. Lastly, the higher\nalways has leeway despite its weakness and dependence on the lower\n(A55d). Laws of dependence help to characterize superposition\nrelations. They organize the order of the strata, so that the\nspiritual level is founded on the psychological level, which in its\nturn is founded on the biological one. Conversely, the biological\nlevel is the bearer of the psychological level and the latter is the\nbearer of the spiritual level.\n5.3 Special Categories\n\nAfter covering the modal categories that allow us to distinguish\nbetween ideal and real spheres in PA, and exhaustively covering\nfundamental categories and categorial laws in A, Hartmann covers the\nspecial categories of the two lower strata in N. Hartmann had already\nworked out a number of special categories belonging to the higher\nstrata in earlier work, including the Ethics and the\nProblem of Spiritual Being. Philosophy of Nature\nexamines the ontological dimensions and categories of the\ncosmological, physical, and biological sciences of his day. Paul\nFeyerabend, while otherwise critical of Hartmann, praises Hartmann for\ndeveloping a coherent \u201cphilosophy of process\u201d in this book\n(Feyerabend 1963, 101). In it, Hartmann declares that\n\u201cmathematical physics deals with reality qua measurable, not\nwith reality as such\u201d (N24), and further develops his complex\nsystems conception of living things. Hartmann\u2019s work in these\nareas was influential for scientists like Konrad Lorenz (1903\u20131989)\nand Ludwig Bertalanffy (1901\u20131972), who explicitly refer to him.\nI\u2019ll summarize the special categories of the strata here before\nclosing with a few open questions about specific aspects of\nHartmann\u2019s ontology.\n\nThe lowest stratum of material or physical reality includes, for\nexample, the categories of corporeality, space, time, process,\nsubstance, causality, reciprocity, and dynamic structure and\nequilibrium (N1\u201344). Next, organic beings embody a peculiar organic\nstructure defined in terms of adaptability, purposiveness, metabolism\nor self-regulation, self-restoration, reproductive fitness, and\nhereditary constancy and variation (N45\u201364). In agreement with Scheler\nand the work of many ethologists (Scheler 2009 [1928]), it is widely\nrecognized that many types of animals possess a mental life. This\npsychological or mental stratum includes awareness, unconscious\nprocesses, pleasure and pain, conditioned learning, habit, associative\nmemory, communication, emotional response, problem-solving\nintelligence, and the categories of rigid social relations (NW). The\nstratum of spiritual capacities includes the power of conceptual\nthought, knowledge acquisition, ideal relations, moral evaluation and\nvalues, symbolic communication, teleological reasoning, personality,\nand all of the categories of the complex and variable social\nrelationships evinced by humanity. Historical reality and culture, or\nobjective and objectivated spirit, form the immediate context for a\ncharacteristically human existence (NW; P). Human beings are the most\nvulnerable entities, the most conditioned and dependent; but they have\nknowledge, they can consciously adapt, and they can use other entities\nfor their own purposes (A56b, d, 60a; ELO). The strata laws described\nabove specify why none of these strata is explanatorily reducible to\nanother.\n\nIn recent literature, a number of questions have arisen about\nHartmann\u2019s theory of stratification. One concerns the borderline\nbetween psychological and spiritual strata. Hartmann himself\nacknowledges that the distinction between the psychological and the\nspiritual levels is problematic. Hartmann vacillates as to the\ndelimitations of what is properly psychological. He assigns language,\nconsciousness, and foresight alternatively to the psychological level\nor to the personal level of the spirit. He even claims that the same\nacts of consciousness pertain to both psychic and spiritual being and\nthat only an exact clarification of the phenomenon of mental acts may\nsolve the aporia. Some authors have attempted to clarify\nthese relations (Scognamiglio 2011), while others have pointed out\nthat the overall architecture of the theory of strata of reality, or\nthe relations among the biological, the psychological and spiritual\nlevels, may need to be revised. Put briefly, if the psychological\nlevel ends up including what psychology and cognitive sciences\nacknowledge as psychological phenomena, the dividing line between the\npsychological and the spiritual levels should be located elsewhere,\nand what Hartmann calls personal spirit will become the higher layer\nof the psychological level. The reorganization suggested enables\nconstruction of an entirely different architecture of the three\nlevels, one that passes from a strictly linear organization (one level\nafter the other) to a non-linear, \u201ctriangular\u201d\narchitecture, which would be a major departure from Hartmann\u2019s\noriginal framework (Poli 2001; for other proposals, see Kleineberg\n2016, Dziadkowiec 2011).\n\nAnother question regarding stratification that even Hartmann faced\nduring his lifetime was how this stratified scheme bears on the\nquestion of emergence (or \u201csupervenience\u201d). Hartmann\nhimself explicitly refused to present an emergentist theory, and\ncharacteristically, he left the question whether an\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d account of the emergence of strata could be\nprovided entirely open (NW10). Consequently, it has been argued that\nattempts to treat Hartmann\u2019s ontology as emergentist are flawed\nby their conflation of the granular or hierarchical series of\nentities, as in a mereological hierarchy, with the series of strata\nthemselves (Dahlstrom 2012; Peterson 2016).\n6. Conclusion: What is Philosophy?\n\nAs mentioned above, Hartmann\u2019s philosophical style presented a\nstrong contrast with that of his peers. Philosophy for Hartmann was a\ncritical, systematic, analytical investigation into the fundamental\nproblems of existence. It meant rejecting ready-made standpoints,\nungrounded speculation, system-building, and extreme, improbable\nconclusions. He claimed that \u201cthe prerequisite of systematic\nthinking is the purity of the philosophical ethos,\u201d which is\n\u201cperseverance in investigation, patient waiting, capacity to\nremain suspended in uncertainty,\u201d the \u201cgenuine dianoetic\nvirtue of the philosopher\u201d (S 5\u20136). Utilizing the methods of\nphenomenology and aporetics before passing to theory, critical\nontology is the desideratum for systematic philosophy (S 51).\nPhilosophy is not about committing to a single monolithic standpoint\nor theory and looking at every human problem through its narrow lens.\nIt is not system-building speculative idealism (German Idealism), an\nepistemology of the sciences (positivism), logical idealism (Marburg\nNeo-Kantianism), transcendental phenomenology (Husserl), universal\nhermeneutic phenomenological ontology (early Heidegger), theory of\nworldviews (Dilthey), philosophy of life (Bergson), or metaphysical\npersonalism (Scheler). All of these theoretical standpoints invariably\ncommit the chief fallacy, identified by Hartmann, of attempting to use\none set of categories to explain the entirety of the real world\n(Peterson 2012). Hartmann\u2019s articulated and robust categorial\nontology leaves room for the fantastic diversity and abundance of the\nworld, provides a satisfying nonanthropocentric humanist account of\nthe place of humankind in the cosmos, and has even inspired a recent\ncomprehensive approach to environmental philosophy (Peterson 2020).\nThere is much to be learned from Hartmann\u2019s work, and this\narticle only scratches the surface.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources (Selected)"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<h4>Original Works in German</h4>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1908, <em>\u00dcber das Seinsproblem in der griechischen\nPhilosophie vor Plato</em>, Dissertation, Marburg.", "1909, <em>Platos Logik des Seins</em>, Gie\u00dfen:\nT\u00f6pelmann.", "1909, <em>Des Proklus Diadochus philosophische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde\nder Mathematik</em>, Gie\u00dfen: T\u00f6pelmann.", "1912, <em>Philosophische Grundfragen der Biologie</em>,\nVandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G\u00f6ttingen.", "1912, \u201cSystematische Methode,\u201d <em>Logos</em>, 3 (2):\n121\u2013163.", "1914, \u201c\u00dcber die Erkennbarkeit des Apriorischen,\u201d\n<em>Logos</em>, 5 (3): 290\u2013329.", "1921, <em>Grundz\u00fcge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis</em>,\nBerlin-Leipzig: De Gruyter.", "1924, \u201cWie ist kritische Ontologie \u00fcberhaupt\nm\u00f6glich?\u201d, <em>Kleinere Schriften</em>, 3, Berlin: De\nGruyter, 1958, 268\u2013313.", "1923\u20131929, <em>Die Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus.
