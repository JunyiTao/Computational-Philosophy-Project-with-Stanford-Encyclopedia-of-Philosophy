    "main_text": "Transcendentals\n5. Transcendentals\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 1 Godfrey identifies the one, the true, and the\ngood as properties of being that are really identical and convertible\nwith it, and hence as transcendental characteristics of being. These\nproperties are not really distinct from being itself (PB 2.163\u201364). In\nQuodlibet VI, q. 16 he distinguishes between the one or the kind of\nunity that serves as a principle for number and which is based on\ndiscrete quantity (numerical unity in the strict sense), and the kind\nthat is convertible with being. While the former is restricted to\ncorporeal being, the latter applies to every subsisting substance and\nto every accident that exists in such a substance. Hence it alone is\ntranscendental (PB 3.256\u201358). Regarding the true, in Quodlibet VI, q. 6\nGodfrey indicates that truth adds nothing real to being but only a\n(conceptual) relationship to mind or intellect. To assign this kind of\ntruth to a thing is simply to acknowledge that it can be grasped by\nintellect or that it is intelligible. Consequently, Godfrey holds that\ntruth is present in being virtually insofar as it has the capacity\n(virtus) to produce truth in the intellect. But he favors the\nview that when taken formally truth resides in the intellect (PB\n3.137\u201341; Wippel, 1981, 25\u201334). Hence here he is recognizing the\ndistinction later referred to as that between ontological truth and\nlogical truth.\n",
