    "main_text": "Astrology\n2. Astrology\n\n\nThe central place of astrology in Ibn Ezra\u2019s thought must be singled\nout here. The query of the rabbis of Provence to Maimonides about the\nlegitimacy of astrology was most likely prompted by the spread of Ibn\nEzra\u2019s astrological teachings (Sela 2004). Though the query and\nMaimonides\u2019 response both turned upon the interpretation of\ntraditional texts and their legal implications, de rigueur in\ncorrespondence of this sort, one finds here new probings into issues\nsuch as free will and divine governance. Ibn Ezra spurred a\nreassessment of Jewish positions on these points.\n\n\nAstrology was one of Ibn Ezra\u2019s major interests, and it plays an\nimportant role in his thought (Sela 2001, mainly for bibliography;\nGoldstein 1996, for precise contents analysis). Briefly\u2014in fact,\nas we have repeatedly noted, Ibn Ezra\u2019s expositions are always brief,\nwith little argumentation\u2014Ibn Ezra considers the material\nuniverse to be divided into celestial and terrestrial realms, the\nlatter totally under the sway of the former. Humans can link up to a\nthird, divine and super-celestial realm, thus outmaneuvering the\nstars, so to speak. However, more often than not, this will bring no\nrelief to one\u2019s earthly plight; in any case, pessimism of this sort\ninforms Ibn Ezra\u2019s commentary to Ecclesiastes. Ibn Ezra advocates a\nStoic-like faith: the connection to the world \u201cabove the\nstars\u201d affords one the spiritual stamina to endure whatever\nearthly misery the stars may dish out (Langermann 1993).\n\n\nThere is no difference between Jews and non-Jews with regard to astral\ngovernance. Here again, Ibn Ezra, in his biblical commentaries, was\nvague enough to give the impression that Jews alone are exempt from\nthe decrees of the stars, thus ingratiating himself to those many of\nhis readers who were disposed to thinking that way. However, in his\nastrological writings, the Jews are no different from other peoples,\nin that they too are associated with certain planets and signs; this\npoint was not lost upon his super-commentators. Ibn Ezra\u2019s astrology,\nlike his philosophy overall, is humanist and universal, not Jewish and\nparticularist. (See on this point, from a different perspective,\nHughes 1999.)\n\n\nAstrology offered a rational explanation for some biblical\ncommandments, particularly animal sacrifices. True, over a millennium\nhad passed since the Temple temple rituals had ceased. However, new\nconceptions of worship led Jews to wonder why such acts had ever been\nneeded. In addition, new conceptions of Scripture caused Jews to ask\nwhy the details of the sacrifices had been recorded in the Torah, all\nof whose teachings were thought to be of permanent value, even if the\nrites themselves were no longer performed. Astrology provided a\nrationale: a practical reason for doing these performances as long as\nthe Temple stood, and a lesson in the way the cosmos functions whose\nvalue endures even after the Temple\u2019s destruction. It should be added,\nhowever, that there is no evidence at all that these explanations\ninspired calls for the restoration of sacrifice. Ibn Ezra\u2019s followers\nwere content merely to ponder these truths. Ironically, perhaps, the\nmessianic drive exhibited itself more in the thought of Judah Halevi\nwhose basic outlook, as we shall see, was diametrically opposed to\nthat of Ibn Ezra.\n",
