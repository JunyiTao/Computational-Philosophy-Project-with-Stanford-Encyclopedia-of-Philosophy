Welfarist approaches have been\nquestioned by the results of Yaari and Bar Hillel (1984), the\nPigou-Dalton principle has been critically scrutinized by Amiel and\nCowell (1992), the principles of compensation and reward have obtained\nmixed support in Schokkaert and Devooght (1998), etc. It is of course\ndebatable how much theorists can learn from such results (Bossert\n1998).\n\nSurveys of this questionnaire approach are available in Schokkaert and\nOverlaet (1989), Amiel and Cowell (1999), Schokkaert (1999), Gaertner\nand Schokkaert (2011). Philosophers have also performed similar\ninquiries (Miller 1992).\n",
