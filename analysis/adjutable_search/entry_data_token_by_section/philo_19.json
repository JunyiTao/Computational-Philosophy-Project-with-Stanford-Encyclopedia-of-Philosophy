    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || The sage, the divine man\n5.5 The sage, the divine man\n\nThe Quod omnis probus is one of the most puzzling Philonian\ntreatises. Despite the fact that Eusebius included it in his catalogue\nof the works of Philo, the question of its authenticity was often\ndiscussed from the middle of the 19th century. The main\narguments against its authenticity were the massive presence of\nStoicism and the lack of any allegoric commentary. Biblical references\nare rare, only five quotations used for an apologetic purpose. From a\nphilosophical point of view, it is not easy to understand how Philo,\nwho was a major user of Stoic topoi, but always showing\ndistance towards them, seems to have fully adopted the paradox of the\nperfect liberty of the sage, even when he is in a situation of\nslavery. Did Philo adopt the Stoic view that the sage embodies the\nperfection of human nature? And how could he reconcile this with the\nJewish conception of a human being marked by Original Sin? More\ngenerally, between Stoicism affirming that the wise man is the equal\nof God and Plato proposing that man assimilate to God to the furthest\nextent possible, where did Philo stand? The first remark is that Philo\ndoes not consider Stoicism an autonomous thought in the\nProbus. According to Philo\u2014if he really was the author\nof the treatise\u2014Zeno, the creator of the Stoa, most likely found\nhis doctrine of human liberty in the Bible, more precisely in Genesis\n27:40, the story of two brothers, one moderate, the other shameless.\nTheir father wanted the shameless to be the slave of the moderate one\nin order to improve the shameless one. The perfection of the sage in\nthe Probus is always subordinated to that of God, who is\ninfinitely superior. In Stoic doctrine, God is the logos, and\nthat means that He and the human being have the same nature, perfect\nin the first case, perfectible in the second one. In Philo\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Bible, the distance between the two is infinite.\nEven if man is created in the image of God, the Philonian negative\ntheology affirms that we know nothing about Him. Philo says in the\nProbus 20 that only he who has no other master than God is\nfree. He adds that this man is also the master of other human beings,\nthe deadly vicar of a Grand Immortal King. In Stoic doctrine, the Sage\nis the King and the next best human beings are his ministers. There is\nno mention of a mightier king. But how can Philo say that a human\nbeing is divine?\n\nLitwa (2014) focuses on the deification of Moses. In conclusion, Litwa\naffirms that \u201cMoses is deified by participating in the\nlogos, the Mind of God, and Philo\u2019s \u2018second\nGod\u2019\u201d (2014: 27). God is the King and God of gods, while\nMoses is only a god with regard to mankind. It can only be added that\nif the Sage embodies the exceptional fulfillment of the human nature\nin Stoicism, in Somn. 2.234, the perfect man is said to be\nneither of an ungenerated nature nor a mortal one. Not only the\ncontext of Middle Platonism but also the beginning of the deification\nof the princeps in the Roman empire can help understand why\nPhilo so easily expressed the idea of the man-god, which seemed to be\nfar from his own convictions. \n",
