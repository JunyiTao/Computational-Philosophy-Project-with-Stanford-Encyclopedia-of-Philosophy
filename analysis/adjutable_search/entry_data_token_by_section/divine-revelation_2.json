    "main_text": "Conceptions of Divine Revelation || Manifestational and Propositional Revelation\n1.2 Manifestational and Propositional Revelation\n\nA useful distinction related to the means of revelation (k) is\nbetween manifestational and non-manifestational\nrevelation (Wolterstorff 1995: 26). Manifestational revelation happens\nwhen somebody \u201cshows\u201d or in some other way makes some\nreality manifest, while non-manifestational revelation takes place\nwhen something is revealed without being shown or manifested\u2014for\nexample, by means of verbal communication. According to Wolterstorff,\nthe essential difference between these two ways of revealing is that\nin the case of manifestational revelation, the means of revelation is\na natural sign of the reality revealed (such as the reality itself, or\na characteristic causal effect of it). In the case of\nnon-manifestational revelation, the means is not a natural sign.\nInstead it can be conventional sign (e.g., a sentence), or some other\nentity, such as a belief implanted in somebody\u2019s mind by God.\n\n\nMavrodes has subdivided non-manifestational varieties of revelation\ninto two categories which he calls \u201cthe communication\nmodel\u201d and \u201cthe causation model\u201d (in addition to\nthese, he suggests a \u201cmanifestation model\u201d). In the\ncommunication model, revelation is understood as something analogous\nto speech and related linguistic activities. In the causation model,\nrevelation happens by God causing beliefs in people, either from the\nbeginning of a person\u2019s existence, or at some later time\n(Mavrodes 1988: 73\u201374).\n\nA concept that has figured importantly in debates about the means of\nrevelation is \u201cpropositional revelation\u201d. Wolterstorff\nclaims that this is just another name for non-manifestational\nrevelation. Since propositions are an essential part of the\nmeans (k) of non-manifestational revelations (as we will see),\nthere seems to be good reason for this identification. However, in\ntwentieth century theology, \u201cpropositional revelation\u201d has\nreceived something of a bad reputation. A typical criticism is\nexpressed by Hordern: \u201cWhat God reveals is not propositions or\ninformation\u2014what God reveals is God\u201d (Hordern 1959:\n61\u201362; see also Baillie 1956: 28; Kelsey 1975: 32; Schw\u00f6bel\n1990: 34; Williams 2000: 131). In modern theology,\n\u201cpropositional\u201d accounts of revelation are often said to\nhave given way to a focus on divine \u201cself-revelation\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe locus of revelation is not propositions but events, and its\ncontent is not a body of truths about God, but \u201cthe living\nGod\u201d revealing himself in his actions toward man. (Hick 1967:\n190)\n\n\nIn order to address this debate about the role of propositions in\nrevelation, and to assess the theological critique, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between two questions:\n\nHow do propositions figure in the means of revelation\n(k)?\nHow do propositions figure in the content of revelation\n(a)?\n\n\nThere is no consensus about the nature or even existence of\npropositions, but most philosophers would agree that propositions (if\nthey exist) can be true or false, and that they are\n\u201csharable\u201d. Many people can believe the same proposition\nat the same time, and many different sentences can express the same\nproposition (e.g., \u201cSchnee is Weiss\u201d and \u201cSnow is\nwhite\u201d). Assuming this view, there are at least two ways in\nwhich propositions could figure in the means (k) of revelation.\nFirst, if God speaks\u2014in a literal sense of \u201cspeaks\u201d,\nthat is, if he uses sentences to communicate\u2014then\nsentences would be the primary means of revelation. However,\nif propositions constitute the meaning of sentences, then\npropositions would figure importantly as well. Second, suppose that\nGod does not speak in this literal sense, but instead directly causes\ncertain people to have certain beliefs. In that case, the beliefs that\nGod causes would be the primary means of revelation. However, since\npropositions constitute the cognitive contents of beliefs,\npropositions would figure importantly too.\n\nIn manifestational revelation, the means is\n(paradigmatically) a direct presentation or manifestation of the very\nreality that God wishes to reveal\u2014for example himself.\nIn this kind of \u201cmeans\u201d, propositions are not involved.\nGod is not a proposition, obviously, and neither does God have a\nproposition as his \u201ccontent\u201d. Hence, a central difference\nbetween manifestational and propositional (non-manifestational)\nrevelation seems to be, unsurprisingly, that propositions figure\nimportantly in the means of the latter, but not in the means of the\nformer.\n\nHowever, and perhaps more surprisingly, when it comes to the\ncontent of revelation, the same does not seem to be true.\nPropositions must, arguably, figure as part of the content of\nmanifestational revelations as well as in the content of propositional\nrevelation. We can see this by the following example. Suppose a person\nreveals an object manifestationally by showing it to someone. This\nwill not only reveal the object itself, but also some propositions\nabout it. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the act could count as a\nrevelation. Since revelation is an epistemic concept (or at\nleast has an epistemic dimension), any act of revelation must make\nsomething known or knowable, and this means making at least some\nproposition known or knowable (Wahlberg 2014:\n30\u201331).\n\nIn response, it can be argued that there is such a thing as\n\u201cknowledge by acquaintance\u201d that is not reducible to\npropositional knowledge. Or perhaps knowing a person is\nirreducible to knowing about that person (see, e.g., Stump\n2010: Ch. 3\u20134).\nEven so, it is difficult to see how one could get\nacquaintance-knowledge or \u201cpersonal\u201d knowledge of a person\n(or of God) without also having a good deal of propositional knowledge\nabout him. For example, how could one know somebody by acquaintance\nwithout at the same time knowing that this person exists\n(which is a piece of propositional knowledge)? (Wellington 2019: 166;\nLamont 2004: 7\u20138).\n\nThis reasoning will not convince those who deny the existence of\npropositions (see, e.g., Westphal 1999 for an anti-realist critique).\nHowever, among those who accept propositions, many have taken the\ncontrast that Hordern and others draw between revelation of\npropositions and divine self-revelation to be\nmisconceived. God could not reveal himself without simultaneously\nrevealing (making knowable) some propositions about himself.\nPropositions must figure in the content (a) of both\npropositional and manifestational revelations. In manifestational\nrevelations, however, they do not figure as means\n(k).\n\nAnother important difference between propositional and manifestational\nrevelation concerns the need for interpretation. In manifestational\nrevelation, the audience is confronted with \u201craw\nreality\u201d\u2014for example \u201cGod himself\u201d, or some\nspectacular historical event. Such media of revelation contain a\nwealth of information, and it is up to the recipient to decide which\naspects of the manifestation to focus on. In propositional revelation,\non the other hand, the audience is confronted with entities such as\nwords and sentences that are specially designed to express a\ndeterminate message. Something similar is presumably true in cases of\ndivine direct communication of knowledge to a person\u2019s mind.\nHence, even though interpretation is involved in the reception of both\npropositional and manifestational revelation, in the case of\npropositional revelation, less of it is needed (Wolterstorff 1995:\n29). Arguably, it follows from this that if God wants to convey a\nfairly determinate cognitive content, he will have good reason to use\nsome form of propositional revelation (perhaps in addition to\nmanifestational revelation) (Mansini 2018: 260).\n\nWhy, then, are some theologians critical of propositional revelation?\nWhile here are different kinds of critique (Helm 1972; Gunton 1995:\n7\u201313), the main objection has to do with how the notion of\npropositional revelation is thought to affect biblical interpretation.\nStandardly, the critics\u2019 argument (made from a Christian\nperspective) goes something like this:\n\n If there is such a thing as propositional\nrevelation, it is found in the Bible.\n If there is propositional revelation in the Bible,\nthen it is communicated through literal language that\nstraightforwardly expresses divinely revealed propositions (Dulles\n1992: 48).\n However, it is very implausible that God\ncommunicates in this way, since the Bible often uses metaphor and\nnarrative rather than literal language. Moreover, the Bible contains\nerroneous and problematic claims and views, and historical-critical\nscholarship has shown that the text is shaped by the contingent\nhistorical, cultural and political contexts of the human authors\n(Dulles 1992: 49).\n Hence, the Bible does not contain propositional revelation.\n Hence, there is no propositional revelation.\n\n\nAn \u201ceasy\u201d response to this argument points out that it\nassumes that either the whole Bible constitutes propositional\nrevelation, or else there is no propositional revelation in the Bible\nat all. However, it is possible that\nparts of the Bible record propositional revelations\nthat were originally given to prophets, apostles and others. Moreover, some\noriginal divine communications of this kind might not even be recorded\nin the Bible but instead preserved and interpreted through an oral\ntradition, as traditional Catholic and Orthodox perspectives hold\n(however, see Ratzinger 1966: 46).\n\nMany defenders of propositional revelation believe that this\n\u201ceasy\u201d response concedes too much ground to the critics.\nThey argue that the Bible as a whole can reasonably be believed to be\n\u201cauthored\u201d by God and expressive of propositional\nrevelation. Attacking\n premise 2,\n the defenders of divine authorship point out that propositions can be\nexpressed by metaphorical and other non-literal forms of language. A\npropositional construal of biblical revelation does not mean that a\nnarrowly literalistic approach to the Bible is necessary (Lamont 2004:\nCh. 5; Wolterstorff 1995: Ch. 11\u201312; McCall 2009). Attacking\n premise 3,\n they furthermore argue that divine authorship is compatible with the\ntext being shaped by the cultural and personal perspectives of the\nhuman authors. God could, for example, author the Bible by\n\u201cappropriating\u201d or \u201cauthorizing\u201d human\ndiscourse, thereby making human utterances or speech-acts into\nvehicles of his own discourse. In a similar way as a president can\nauthorize an ambassador to speak on her behalf, or a speaker can\nappropriate the utterances of others by quotation or paraphrase, so\nGod could \u201cborrow\u201d human speech-acts without depriving the\nhuman authors of genuine authorship (Wolterstorff 1995: Ch. 3. For\ncriticism, see Wisse 2002; Levine 1998). If this is what God has done,\nthen biblical interpretation will require that we distinguish between\nthe intentions and message of the human authors, and the intention and\nmessage of the divine, appropriating discourse. The former may contain\nerroneous or morally problematic views, which are not asserted by the\ndivine author.\n\nAnother way of explaining how a medium of divine propositional\nrevelation could possibly contain errors, is by distinguishing between\nthe statements that are expressed through the medium (the\nbiblical text), and the sometimes problematic cultural\npresuppositions in terms of which they are expressed\n(Swinburne 2007: Ch. 2). Since it is probably impossible to make\nstatements that do not depend on the presuppositions of any particular\nculture, and since all cultures embody some false beliefs and\nproblematic conceptions, it is to be expected, argues Swinburne, that\na divine revelation will be expressed by means of presuppositions some\nof which are false (for criticism, see Stump 1994: 740\u2013741).\n\nThe discussion about propositional revelation in the Bible or other\nsacred documents raises questions about God\u2019s causal role in the\nproduction of the text. A common view is that the Bible (or the\nQur\u2019an) acquires its status as revelation and/or as being\n\u201cauthored\u201d by God as a result of its being\ninspired by God. According to a common understanding,\ninspiration is a special divine influence on the writers of the\nbiblical books. (Not all theologians accept this view of biblical\ninspiration, however, see, e.g., Trembath 1987: 5, 109\u2013118;\nBurtchaell 1969: Ch. 5.) The divine influence could conceivably take\ndifferent forms (Davies 2009: 41\u201344; Burtchaell 1969). According\nto theories of \u201cverbal inspiration\u201d, God provides a quite\ndetailed guidance by controlling the authors\u2019 choice of words.\nThis theory does not necessarily entail divine\n\u201cdictation\u201d, however; dictation theories are best\nconceived as a subspecies of verbal inspiration. \u201cContent\ntheories\u201d also come in different forms. Some involve a detailed\ndivine guidance on the level of statements or propositions, while\nother versions portray inspiration as limited to the main ideas of the\ntext. It is also possible to posit different degrees and modes of\ninspiration in different parts of the Bible (O\u2019Collins 2016a:\n160\u2013161). Another, rather recent theory suggests that God,\nthrough his \u201cmiddle-knowledge\u201d, could providentially have\ncontrolled the human authors of the Bible without taking away their\nfreedom (Craig 1999). Lastly, the theory of \u201csocial\ninspiration\u201d (sometimes \u201cecclesial inspiration\u201d)\ntries to account for the fact that the biblical books have a complex\nhistory of origin which involves, besides authors and redactors,\nprocesses of oral transmission in liturgical and other social contexts\n(Benoit 1965: 24\u201326; Barr 1983: 27; Farkasfalvy 2010: 211).\nPresumably, if God is to control the outcome of such a process, he\nmust influence social groups over extended periods of time.\n\nWhat is the relationship between divine inspiration and the\nidea of divine authorship of the Bible? According to\nWolterstorff, these are quite distinct phenomena. Inspiration has to\ndo with God\u2019s superintendence over the production of a\ntext, while divine authorship has to do with God\u2019s\nauthorization of a text (Wolterstorff 1995: 41\u201342). In\nprinciple, God could authorize or appropriate a certain\ntext\u2014making it his own by \u201csigning\u201d it, as it\nwere\u2014without having superintended or influenced its production\nin any way. Of course, God must do something in order for\nauthorization to happen, for example influencing the process of\ncanonization. For Wolterstorff, however, the Bible\u2019s status as\nauthored by God does not essentially depend on its being inspired.\nThat said, \n\n\nit would be bizarre to think of God as just finding these books lying\nabout and deciding to appropriate them. (Wolterstorff 1995: 187) \n\n\nSome kind of divine inspiration seems very probable also on\nWolterstorff\u2019s view. (For the justification of belief in\ninspiration, see Crisp 2009.)\n\nAccording to traditional Christian perspectives, on the other hand,\ndivine inspiration is an essential condition for divine authorship\n(see, e.g., Feingold 2016: 284). This is true of traditional Catholic\nas well as Protestant views, which both assume a pervasive divine\nguidance that extends to all parts of the biblical text and guarantees\nthe aptness of the authors\u2019 choice of words (without necessarily\ninvolving \u201cdictation\u201d). Traditional views also presume\nthat inspiration entails inerrancy\u2014that is, freedom from errors\nin all respects, not just with respect to essential contents\n(Burtchaell 1969: 1\u20132; for a critique of inerrancy, see Abraham\n1981: Ch. 1). \n\nCan a \u201cstrong\u201d theory of inspiration of this sort be\ndefended? Besides challenges from contemporary biblical criticism,\nsuch views also face the challenge to explain how inspiration is\ncompatible with the freedom of the human authors (which few would want\nto deny) and their status as genuine authors rather than mere puppets.\nPerhaps the best shot at success belongs to those who defend a\ntraditional view from the standpoint of a Thomistic understanding of\ndivine causality. From such a perspective, God is the principal cause\nand the human authors of the Bible are secondary or instrumental\ncauses (see Feingold 2016: 289\u2013295; for criticism, see Rahner\n1964). Instrumental causes are real causes, so the human authors are\nreal authors. Moreover, God presumably does not choose instrumental\ncauses arbitrarily, but with an eye to their aptness for the effects\nhe has in mind (i.e., the texts). The diversity found in the Bible\ncould hence be precisely what God aimed at in choosing people with\ndifferent temperaments, skills, and experiences as his instruments.\nStill, since the effect of an instrumental cause transcends the power\nof that cause taken alone and manifests the power of the principal\ncause, it is appropriate to say that God is the principal author of\nthe Bible. Moreover, according to the Thomistic view, God acts through\ninstrumental causes in a way that respects their nature, and this is\ntrue also when God uses human free will as an instrument. The human\nauthors, hence, are \u201cliving and free instruments\u201d rather\nthan puppets (Feingold 2016: 290).\n\nA potential weakness of this account is that it presumes a\ncontroversial (and possibly incoherent) view about the compatibility\nof human freedom and divine causality. On the other hand, precisely by\nadopting this view, the account avoids the implausible conclusion that\nGod and human authors are involved in a kind of \u201cdivision of\nlabor\u201d (God being responsible for some aspects of the text,\ne.g., the ideas, and human authors for other aspects, e.g., the\nwords). If divine and human causality are not related in the manner of\na \u201czero-sum game\u201d, both God and the human authors could be\ninvolved in shaping all aspects of the text. However, some authors\nclaim that a \u201cMolinistic\u201d approach, based on God\u2019s\n\u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d, could also account for the\ndivine-human character of the Bible as a whole, while avoiding some\nproblematic aspects of the Thomistic view (Craig 1999).\n",
