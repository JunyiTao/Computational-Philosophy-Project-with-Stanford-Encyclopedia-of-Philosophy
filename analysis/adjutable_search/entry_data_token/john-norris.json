Life and Main Works\n\nJohn Norris was born on January 2, 1657 in Collingbourne Kingston,\nWiltshire. His father was a minister, and Norris was the second of\nfour siblings. His early training was a Puritan one. In 1671, he began\na course of study at Winchester School, where he received a classical\neducation; the curriculum included Greek and Latin literature, and the\nyoung Norris excelled at his studies. He matriculated at Exeter\nCollege, at Oxford, spending the years from 1676 \u2013 1680 studying\nthe Scholastic and ancient authors. In 1680, Norris was elected a\nFellow of All Souls College, a distinction he enjoyed for nine years\nand would always recall fondly. He was ordained in 1684 and sometime\nbefore 1688 he also discovered the works of Malebranche, who would\nbecome one of his philosophical heroes.\n\nIt was during his stay at All Souls that Norris published several of\nhis most popular works. He published the first edition of A\nCollection of Miscellanies in 1687, which would culminate in a\nninth edition printed in 1730. At this time he also published\n\u201cThe Root of Liberty,\u201d a sermon in which he defended human\nfreedom by an appeal to the Augustinian concept of attention. In these\npublications, Norris\u2019 own thought is pronounced; they exhibit an\nindependence from the heavy influence Malebranchean doctrine would\nexert upon Norris\u2019 subsequent works. The Theory and Regulation of\nLove, a piece characterizing love as the summons of God, was\npublished in 1688, and the first text in which Norris clearly adopted\nMalebranchean arguments. Norris appended to this text his\ncorrespondence with Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist. Finally in\n1689, he published Reason and Religion, which would be\nreissued seven times until 1724.\n\nHe resigned the fellowship in 1689, married, and began a two-year\noccupation as rector at Newton St. Loe in Somersetshire. There, he\npublished one of his most popular texts, Christian\nBlessedness, in 1690. One year later, Locke appealed to the Earl\nof Pembroke on Norris\u2019 behalf; consequently, Norris assumed the duties\nof rector at Bemerton near Salisbury. In general, he preferred study\nand meditation, and found his duties as rector to impinge upon his\nscholarly activities. Nonetheless, he maintained various\ncorrespondences. He engaged in correspondences with Elizabeth Thomas\n(\u201cCorinna\u201d), Damaris Cudworth (Lady Masham), Mary Astell\nand Locke, among others. In 1695, Norris published his correspondence\nwith Astell and entitled it, Letters concerning the Love of God,\nbetween the Author of the Proposal to the Ladies and Mr. John\nNorris. Moreover, he found the time to publish pamphlets and\ntreatises on a variety of topics including the Toleration Act,\nChristian morality, the immortality of the soul, and the difference\nbetween the Ideal Philosophy he endorsed and the enthusiasm of the\nQuakers. Norris made clear these differences in an addendum to\nReflections upon the Conduct of Human Life in 1691. Richard\nVickris, the Quaker, replied irately to this addendum. This generated\na heated reply from Norris, in which he further elucidated the\ndifferences between the \u201cdivine light\u201d of his own\nphilosophy and that of the Quaker doctrines. This work was entitled\nTwo Treatises concerning the Divine Light and was issued in\n1692. Locke and Norris shared the objective of debunking the Quakers\u2019\nclaim to direct enlightenment from God. But their differences far\noutweighed their similarities.\n\nIn 1690, Norris issued criticisms of Locke\u2019s An Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding\u00b8 the first edition of which was\npublished in December 1689. Norris\u2019 review, entitled Cursory\nReflections upon a Book called An Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding, prompted Locke to modify the second edition of the\nEssay at 2.10.2. Otherwise, Locke did not reply publicly to\nNorris\u2019 criticisms. It was only after Locke and Norris quarreled that\nLocke published his estimation of Norris\u2019 works. Lady Masham had\nentrusted a letter for Locke to Norris, but news reached Locke that\nNorris had opened the letter. Locke suspected Norris in spite of his\nprotests, and from that time forward, which was the end of 1692, they\nwere not on friendly terms (Cranston 1957, 364\u2013365). Shortly\nthereafter (1693), Locke wrote Remarks upon some of Mr. Norris\u2019\nBooks, Wherein he asserts P. Malebranche\u2019s Opinion of seeing all\nThings in God and Examination of Malebranche. Charlotte\nJohnston has argued that the impetus and target for Locke\u2019s critical\nevaluation of Malebranche\u2019s thought was Norris, whom he viewed as\nreiterating Malebranche\u2019s thought (1958). In the Cursory\nReflections, Norris stated that he would soon publish a treatise,\nin which he would present his own philosophy at length.\n\nBut it was not until 1701 that Norris completed the first volume of\nhis magnum opus, An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or\nIntelligible World. The second volume was issued in 1704.\n(Hereafter, Theory I and Theory II, respectively.)\nNorris examines the divine nature in Theory I and in\nTheory II he details the nature of creation, specifically the\nnature of humanity and animals. These highly theoretical works did not\nenjoy the popular success of his other writings. One of these, An\nAccount of Reason and Faith, in Relation to the Mysteries of\nChristianity, was so well-read that it was issued in a fourteenth\nedition as late as 1790. His last two theoretical works concerned the\nnature of the soul: A Philosophical Discourse concerning the\nNatural Immortality of the Soul, published in 1708, and A\nLetter to Mr. Dodwell concerning the Immortality of the Soul of\nMan, issued in 1709. It would seem that his many duties as rector\ndid not hinder him completely from engaging in his beloved\nintellectual pursuits, as his publication record demonstrates. His\nfinal publication within his own lifetime, A Treatise concerning\nChristian Prudence, was printed just a year before his death. He\ndied in February of 1711, aged fifty-six years, at Bemerton, and was\ninterred there.\n\nIt is puzzling that a figure as popular and widely-read as Norris has\nreceived such little recognition from intellectual historians of the\nearly modern period. Perhaps Norris has not been paid much attention\nbecause his philosophical writings appear to contain an eclectic\nmixture of many divergent, incompatible sources rather than a coherent\nsynthesis of those sources. Charles McCracken notes that Norris has\nbeen dubbed in a variety of ways, but that the \u201cEnglish\nMalebranche\u201d seems most appropriate (179). Norris was heavily\ninfluenced by Malebranche, and goes so far as advising his own\nchildren that Malebranche\u2019s Search after Truth should\n\u201calways be read, studied, dwelt and fed upon till it be\ndigested, made your own, and converted as it were into the very\nSubstance of your Souls\u201d (Spiritual Counsel 501).\nNorris was also a follower of Descartes, whom Norris viewed as\nconstructing \u201cthe only intelligible Frame of Natural Science\nthat has yet appear\u2019d in the World, and the only intire System that\ndeserves the name of Philosophy\u201d (500). Norris also\ndraws liberally from his Scholastic background, and frequently uses\ntheoretical tools borrowed from the canonical thinkers taught at the\nuniversities, such as Aquinas, Augustine and Suarez. His heavy\nreliance on diverse intellectual sources, especially Descartes and\nMalebranche, is apparent in his writings. Nonetheless, his arguments\nare tremendously valuable for understanding better the debates of his\ntime. His rehearsal of Descartes\u2019 real distinction proof and his\nevaluation of Locke\u2019s thinking matter hypothesis exposes some critical\nLockean assumptions, bringing into sharp relief the disagreements\nbetween the rationalists and empiricists of that era. He also\ninfluenced the views of other minor figures, most notably, Mary Astell\nand Arthur Collier. Finally, Norris\u2019 adaptation and expansion of\nMalebranche\u2019s twin doctrines of Vision in God and occasionalism are\nalso central to understanding the continuation of the Cartesian\nproject in late 17th and early 18th century\nEngland.\n2. God\n2.1 The Intelligible World\n\nThe intelligible world is the realm of Platonic objects that\nconstitutes the source and grounds of human knowledge. Malebranche\u2019s\naccount of the intelligible world is incomplete according to\nNorris:\n\nMalebranch has ventured the farthest of any that I know upon\nthe Discovery. He is indeed the great Galileo of the\nIntellectual World. He has given us the Point of View, and\nwhat ever farther Detections are made, it must be through his\nTelescope\u2026But even this great Apelles has\ndrawn this Celestial Beauty but half way, and I am afraid the\nexcellent Piece will Suffer, whatever other hand has the finishing of\nit. (Theory I 4)\n\n\nNorris considers his Theories I and II to be the\ncompletion of Malebranche\u2019s project. In Theory I, Norris\ndiscusses the nature of God, and in Theory II he discusses\nhow creation is related to God. The most substantial expansion upon\nMalebranche\u2019s thought occurs in the first part of this treatise, where\nNorris spends a great deal of time arguing that God is truth. The\nintelligible world is the mind of God, a \u201ckind of Terra\nIncognita, a more Intellectual America\u201d (3).\n\nNorris first argues for the existence of an ideal counterpart to\nnature. Since the world is created, \u201cit must of necessity\nreceive its Being from some other Being that was when it self was\nnot\u201d (18). He considers the nature of a being that is capable of\nbringing existence from absolute privation, and concludes such a being\nmust be infinitely powerful. Relying upon the premise that all action\nis guided by thought, and that God could not have thought about the\nworld because it did not exist at the time, Norris concludes the ideas\nthat guided God\u2019s thought in the creation of the world and its\ninhabitants must be \u201ctheir essential Reasons and Natures before\nthey had any in this, nay even from all Eternity\u2026and that there\nis an Intelligible as well as a Sensible World,\ntruly representative and exhibitive of this,\u201d or \u201c a fair\nintelligible Mirrour\u201d (26). The intelligible world is the\npattern or model of nature, \u201csince it could no more be its own\nExemplary or Formal, than Efficient\nCause\u201d (30).\n\nHis second argument for the intelligible world is from the existence\nof natural kinds. Norris asks \u201cWhy is not the Body of one Man as\nbig as the Globe of the Sun, while that of another is too small to be\nseen without a Microscope?\u201d and answers \u201c\u2019tis not\naccording to the Idea of that Creature that he should be\neither so big, or so little\u201d (39). This stance marks a\nnoteworthy departure from Malebranche, who claims God does not have\nparticular ideas of bodies in Elucidation 10 of the\nSearch. Norris\u2019 next argument begins with our understanding\nof perfect, geometrical objects. Norris says when he views \u201ca\nglobular Body I have naturally excited in me an Idea of a\nperfect Globe or Sphere\u201d (51). This implies the existence of an\nideal sphere because \u201cthe effect cannot have more perfection\nthan its Cause\u2026because the Cause cannot give that to the effect\nwhich it has not it self\u201d (52). Norris concludes that human\nthought of perfect circles proves an ideal circle exists as the cause\nof thought because there are none in nature.\n\nHis fourth argument comes from the nature of truth. Norris considers\nthe skeptic\u2019s claim that there is no absolute truth and turns the\ntable on the skeptic. If the skeptic is right, then there is no truth,\nwhich is itself an absolute truth. As such, the claim, \u2018There is\nno truth\u2019, would be a necessary and eternal truth:\n\nAnd besides when they go to prove this sceptical Position they must do\nit by pretending to lay the Grounds of it in Philosophic Principles\nand Maxims, which besides the Confession of such Principles would be\nto erect their scepticism as an Institution of Science, and then since\nall Science is of Necessary and Immutable things,\nand whatsoever is necessary and immutable is also Eternal, hence it\nfollows yet farther that they will by consequence and must allow not\nonly Truth in general, but also Eternal Truth, since both the\nConclusion which they pretend to prove, and the Principles whereby\nthey prove it, according to them must be such. (65)\n\n\nThere are eternal truths, as even the skeptic must admit, so there are\nalso eternal relations of ideas because truth relates ideas. In\nNorris\u2019 view, it is the divine ideas that are related. Truth is\ngrounded \u201cupon this necessity of Union and Connexion of Ideas in\ncertain Propositions\u201d (67). Norris adapts Suarez\u2019 view that all\nrelations are accidental, hence require a subject. Nonetheless, Norris\nargues that the eternal truths \u201care Real, and have an\nexistence out of, and independent upon the understanding\u201d (70).\nThe eternal truths derive their reality from the \u201cSimple\nEssences of things\u201d and these are the eternal divine ideas,\nwhich stand in Suarezian accidental relations to one another (71).\nNorris\u2019 fifth argument for the existence of divine ideas is that there\nare objective sciences concerning universals, such as metaphysics and\ngeometry. These disciplines concern necessary knowledge, \u201cto\nspeak more conformably to the School-language, in a knowledge acquired\nby Demonstration\u201d (128\u2013129). Since all science\nconcerns the necessary and unchanging, science cannot be about\ncontingent things, but about universals. These universals are the\nintelligible objects, or the divine ideas.\n\nNorris\u2019 final and sixth argument for the existence of the intelligible\nworld derives from the existence of God. Indeed, Norris views his own\nwork as the culmination of the project begun by Plato. A proper\nreading of the Timaeus will reveal Plato meant \u201cthe\nExemplaria rerum in mente Divina to be the Original Forms or\nPatterns of things in the divine Understanding\u201d rather than the\nstandard interpretation, which is that the creator consult and not be\nthe locus of abstract objects (139). If God has the ideas, then the\nintelligible world exists because God exists. God has the ideas in an\neminent manner (\u2018eminent\u2019 is discussed further below), and\nthese ideas are the objects of His thought. Relying upon the principle\nthat all knowledge is knowledge of something, Norris concludes that\nthe divine ideas are real objects in the mind of God. These ideas are\n\u201creally Coessential with and indistinct from the Essence of\nGod\u201d (155) so when God considers ideas, God considers himself.\nGod considers himself adequately and inadequately,\n\nAgain when he knows himself absolutely Speaking, he considers himself\nadequately, but in the knowledge of Creatures, or rather of\nhimself in relation to Creatures, he considers himself inadequately,\naccording to those degrees of Being or Perfection wherein his Essence\nis imitable or participable by them. (167)\n\n\nHe concludes his arguments for the existence of the intelligible world\nby stating that the ideal world is better known than the natural world\nbecause it is necessary, eternal and immutable. As Descartes had\nargued, the senses are part of the natural world and are designed to\nassist in preserving the union of soul and body, or to keep one alive,\nnot for delivering knowledge. The nature and existence of the\nintelligible world is discovered by intellectual activity; the highest\ndegree of intellectual activity is the clear and distinct\nperception.\n2.2 God\u2019s Simplicity\n\nWhen one clearly and distinctly cognizes the nature of God, one\nperceives God as simple, immaterial and infinite. In traditional\nChristian doctrine, these attributes are of paramount importance. Any\nphilosophical theory compromising them must be rejected. Norris\nexplains:\n\nThe Truth and Necessity of these Attributes is so Unquestionably\ncertain in the Nature of that Glorious and Adorable Being which we\ncall God, that there needs no other Evidence of the Falshood of any\nHypothesis how rational soever and well adjusted it may\notherwise appear, than the Repugnance which it shall be convinc\u2019d to\ncarry in it to all or any of these Attributes. And therefore it is\nnecessary to acquit our Theory of Ideas from that Inconvenience which\non this side it may seem to lie open to, and which alone would be\nsufficient utterly to Silence and Overthrow it. And since it is\nNecessary, \u2018tis no little Satisfaction to me to find it\nso Feasible. (Theory I 293)\n\n\nSome critics, including Arnauld, had charged Malebranche with\nSpinozism because he claimed God has the idea of intelligible\nextension. Such critics reasoned that the only way for God to contain\nextension is for God to be extended. Norris reconciles God\u2019s\npossession of intelligible extension with the immateriality of God by\nusing the notion of eminent containment. There are two ways a thing\ncan be contained in another, formally or eminently. Norris notes\nformal and eminent containment are usually discussed in the context of\ncausation. Generally, formal containment explains cause and effect\nsequences amongst similar causes and effects. For example, the cause\nof a child\u2019s fear might be the recollection of a frightening image.\nThe child\u2019s fear is formally contained in the recollection. Eminent\ncontainment explains dissimilar causes and effects. When an architect\ndesigns a building, and several months later the architect\u2019s vision is\nrealized in a physical structure, that physical structure was\neminently contained, or contained in a higher manner, in the mind of\nthe architect. All human actions, as long as they are planned, are\neminently contained in the human mind. Analogously, Norris states God\neminently contains extension as a divine idea just as the architect\neminently contains the building. Intelligible extension, then, is a\ndivine idea. Norris believes that the ideal philosophy can settle the\nmeaning of \u2018eminent containment\u2019, and thus settle the\ndispute about intelligible extension. This view is found in\n\u201cPOSTSCRIPT, Concerning the Distinction of Formaliter\nand Eminenter, as applied to the manner of the Perfection\nof Things being in God,\u201d appended to Theory I.\n\nNorris derives the \u201cdivine ideality,\u201d or the divine ideas,\nfrom the infinitude of God, and he derives God\u2019s infinity from the\ndivine ideas (Norris argues this is non-circular as we shall see\nbelow):\n\nAnd as his Ideality may be Demonstratively proved from his Infinity so\nhis Infinity may be very Rationally collected from his Ideality, it\nbeing not Conceivable that any Being that is not Infinite in Being,\nshould be Omniform, or have the Ideal Reasons of all things\nin himself. (297)\n\n\nOne objection Norris raises concerns how the infinite can represent\nthe finite. His answer again relies upon the thought of Suarez, whom\nNorris reread carefully before writing his Theories I and\nII. Suarez had distinguished two ways of being finite. An\nitem can be finite according to its \u201cesse\nformale\u201d or its \u201cesse reale\u201d (300). If\na thing is positively finite, it is limited in such a way that can\nnever be infinite. If a thing is negatively finite, it is finite\n\u201cthough there be no repugnance in its having it [infinitude]\nfrom elsewhere\u201d (301\u2013302, brackets added). A divine idea,\naccording to its esse formale is negatively finite whereas\naccording to its esse reale is infinite. Norris believes\n\u201cIdeas are really Identical with the Divine Nature, and so\npartake of the same real Infinity and Incomprehensibility that\nessentially belongs to it\u201d (302). If each idea is identical to\nGod, then each idea is really infinite, and negatively finite. A\nfurther consequence is that an idea can be called both infinite and\nfinite without contradiction. Norris also notes there is no\nmultiplication of infinities in God on his view. Here Norris diverges\nfrom Malebranche\u2019s view as stated in the second dialogue of\nDialogues on Metaphysics and Religion that God is\n\u201cinfinitely infinite,\u201d which strikes the reader as\ncomparable to Spinoza\u2019s infinite attributes.\n\nOne might wonder how God\u2019s ideality could be proven from his infinity\nand his infinity from his ideality because such an argument appears\ncircular. Norris explains why this need not concern us:\n\nBut now there is no more absurdity in proving the same by the same, if\nby the same be meant only really, not formally the same, than in\nproving one attribute of God by another, as his eternity, suppose,\nfrom the necessity or immutability of his being, which though really\nthe same, yet being of a distinct formality, are allowed in all\nrational discourses about them to be considered and used as if really\ndistinct, as to any consequence from one to the other. (406\u2013407)\n\n\nIndeed, Norris proves the existence of God from the nature of truth,\nwhich is another divine attribute. (See A Metaphysical Essay\n193\u2013207 in Miscellanies.) Norris also proves the many\nattributes of God beginning with God\u2019s attribute of necessary\nexistence, revealed in His proclamation to Moses that He is \u201cI\nAm.\u201d In Reason and Religion Norris interprets this\nproclamation as Being. These various demonstrations proceed by proving\n\u201cthe same by the same\u201d since any and all attributes are\n\u201creally the same\u201d with one another, the attributes are\nidentical to God.\n\nThese arguments preserve the divine attribute of simplicity. If God is\nsimple, then proofs utilizing different attributes must be proofs that\nutilize the same subject. The diversity of the attributes are\nexplained as various ways of cognizing the same divine essence:\n\n\u2026 this Divine Essence which in itself is one and the same\ngeneral Perfection, does exert and display it self variously in its\nOperations, by reason of the Diversity of Objects, the Attributes of\nGod are by us conceiv\u2019d distinctly. Not that they are so in respect of\nGod, with whom they are really one and the same, and consequently so\nalso among themselves, but only with respect to our manner of\nconception. (Reason and Religion 33\u201334)\n\n\nNorris proceeds to explain how an attribute such as omnipotence can be\naccounted for because it is \u201cdisplayed according to the\ndiversity of objects\u201d and \u201cModes of operation\u201d (34).\nIn the mode of creating, God is the omnipotent Creator. The relevant\nobject here is all of creation. In the mode of legislator, God is the\nSupreme Lawgiver, and the relevant object is the moral realm. The\ndiverse ways of considering the natural world are also the many ways\nwe can conceive of God\u2019s attributes. In the end, humanity has partial,\nimperfect views of God according to his operations. A lesser being,\nsuch as a human, can also be known under many operations. One might be\na parent, spouse, writer and teacher. But that person is defined in\nthose roles because of the objects that these titles refer to; in the\ncase of the teacher, the person is a teacher only with respect to the\nstudents taught. One is a parent only with respect to the role played\ntowards offspring, but the person is \u201creally one and the\nsame.\u201d Just as we might come to know an individual better and\nbetter as we come to know more of the person\u2019s roles, so we come to\nknow God better by conceiving of his many attributes. Norris believes\nthat all attributes are one in God, differently conceived according to\nthe roles played and objects considered.\n\nFurthermore, Norris reduces the eternal truths, which are the\naccidental relations amongst the divine ideas to the ideas themselves,\nand then reduces the ideas to God:\n\nThe Divine Ideas are really the same with the Divine Essence. But\nEternal Truths are really the same with the Divine Ideas. Therefore\nEternal Truths are really the same with the Divine Essence.\n(Theory I 332\u2013333)\n\n\nSo it is odd that, after laying out these arguments for the simplicity\nof God, Norris states that the flaw in Descartes\u2019 account of\nvoluntarism is that Descartes had attributed to the divine will what\nbelongs to another attribute of God \u2013 the divine ideality. If\nthe attributes are all one, it is difficult to argue for a priority\namongst attributes. Nonetheless, Norris argues that Descartes was\ncorrect to claim truth must depend on God alone, but incorrectly\nbelieved God arbitrarily creates the eternal truth, for this renders\ntruth as mutable as any other creature. What Descartes missed,\naccording to Norris, was the distinction between God as\nintelligible, or exhibitive, and God as intelligent,\nor conceptive (Miscellanies 440, Theory I\n357\u2013358). To understand God as conceptive is to understand God\nas a thinker, who reflects upon his own ideas. To understand God as\nexhibitive is to understand God qua divine ideas. The\ncomplexity arising from including ideas in the divine mind is a\nfurther difficulty for divine simplicity. In the end, if Norris is to\nbe read as consistent, he must claim that the divine ideality is\nanother attribute of God. Norris might have taken Malebranche\u2019s lead,\nwho wrote, concerning divine simplicity, \u201cI long stopped\nworrying about problems that are beyond me\u201d (qtd. in Schmaltz\n2000 62). But it is noteworthy that Norris did not; concerning the\ntopic of divine simplicity, Norris advances the work of his\npredecessors, in particular the work of Malebranche. In a passage\nreminiscent of Thomistic analogical predication, Norris suggests that\nGod as intelligent, or as engaging in thought, must be\nradically different from our experiences of cogitation:\n\nAnd herein (if I rightly consider what is before me) the conduct of\nthe infinitely wise God differs from that of men. They first form\ntheir design, and then deliberate about the means whereby they may\naccomplish it. And this makes men (who in all things are apt to\nmeasure God by themselves, though he himself tells us that his ways\nare not as our ways) inclinable to think that God does so too, that he\nfirst projects, and then consults his wisdom how to execute. This\nindeed is our way, but this cannot be God\u2019s way, because \u2018tis\nnot the wisest way. (Theory I 44)\n\n\nThe extent of humanity\u2019s knowledge of the essence of God is a problem\nthat has preoccupied many thinkers in the history of Western\nphilosophy. Unlike other areas of inquiry, questions concerning the\nnature of God, even if they are unanswerable now, receive answers in\nthe next life. Although Norris believes that we can answer many\nimportant questions about the divine essence, our view of the\nintelligible world is dim indeed. He concedes that certain mysteries\nare temporarily beyond our ken. Norris would agree with what Descartes\nwrote in his First Replies:\n\nMoreover, God cannot be distinctly known by those who look from a\ndistance, as it were, and try to make their minds encompass his\nentirety all at once. This is the sense in which St. Thomas\nsays\u2026that the knowledge of God is within us \u2018in a\nsomewhat confused manner\u2019. But those who try to attend to God\u2019s\nindividual perfections and try not so much to take hold of them as to\nsurrender to them, using all the strength of their intellect to\ncontemplate them, will certainly find that God provides much more\nample and straightforward subject-matter for clear and distinct\nknowledge than does any created thing. (Philosophical\nWritings, 81\u201382)\n\n\nHumanity does have some reliable knowledge about some subject-matter,\nand Norris offers an account of this partial enlightenment. Norris\nbelieves, for example, that we know enough to clearly and distinctly:\n1. Accept Descartes\u2019 real distinction proof and 2. Refute Locke\u2019s\nthinking matter hypothesis.\n3. Human Knowledge and Creation\n3.1 The Structure and Content of Human Thought\n\nQuestions about the form and content of human thought occupied the\nphilosophers of the early modern period. One helpful way to draw the\nline between the empiricists and the rationalists of this time period\nis along issues concerning human cognition. Norris believes the object\nof thought is always God and the structure of thought facilitates\nobjective, indubitable knowledge. For these reasons, he belongs\nsquarely in the rationalist camp.\n\nNorris espouses a Cartesian theory of human thought, which he\ndelineates in Theory II and Reason and Religion.\nNorris says that all thought exhibits a certain structure \u2013\nformal thought, which is the act of thinking, and objective thought,\nwhich is the object of the thinking. Like Descartes, Norris claims all\nthought is about some thing. Formal thought is always the same,\nwhether we are perceiving or \u201cwilling, desiring, loving, hating,\nhoping, fearing\u2026even sensation it self\u201d\n(Theory II 109). Thoughts differ based upon content. Like\nMalebranche and unlike Descartes, the object of thought is always God,\nand \u201c\u2019tis the diversity of this Ideal Object that makes all the\ndiversity and distinction that is to be found in our Thought, whether\nNatural or Moral\u201d (113). God\u2019s omniform essence is always the\ncontent of perception, intellection and passion. Indeed, all knowledge\nis always of God qua divine ideas. When perceiving the ideas,\nwe are viewing \u201cthe very same Divine Nature it self, as\n\u2018tis variously imitable or Participable ad extra,\naccording to such or such intelligible Degrees of Being or\nPerfection\u201d (Theory I 294). Hence, the sole object of\nour perceptions, both intellectual and sensory, is God. When humans\nthink, we think and conduct proofs in mental propositions, but \u201c\nto Speak exactly \u2018tis not the mental Proposition that it [our\nthought] demonstrates, but \u2018tis the mental Proposition\nthat demonstrates the real. The former belonging to the Act, as the\nlatter does to the Object of Science\u201d (311, brackets added). Our\nthoughts are always about the ideal propositions, constituted by the\ndivine ideas as they are related to one another.\n\nWhen we think in propositions, we usually think directly; direct\nthinking is everyday cognition such as knowing to proceed at green\nlights or knowing dentists\u2019 chairs are frightening. All humanity\nthinks directly, or in these ordinary ways, but some persons engage in\nreflexive thought, or about the mind itself and its contents. In\nreflexive thought, there is a return of the mind onto itself, or an\nattending to the contents of the mind; such reflexive thoughts are\nmore attentive perceptions of the divine ideas, and these thoughts are\ncontemplations of the eternal truths. Norris states along with Locke\n(Essay 4.3.2) that knowledge is perceiving \u201cthose\nRelations of agreement or disagreement that are between Ideas, which\nwhoever clearly and rightly perceives, is truly said to\nknow\u201d (Theory II 147\u2013148). Knowledge of\nthe eternal truths, of course, is the highest grade of knowledge, or\nscientia. By engaging in reflexive thought, we can align our\nmental propositions with the ideal ones. The ultimate intellectual\ngoal is this alignment of our thought with the eternal truths.\n\nNorris adopts the Malebranchean doctrine of Vision in God, which\nstates that all intellectual and sensory perception is perception of\nGod. Norris significantly augments neither Malebranche\u2019s account nor\nargument for Vision in God with respect to sensory perception. Norris\nlimits himself to reproducing Malebranche\u2019s eliminative argument from\nthe Search after Truth for why our sensory perception must be\nof ideas in God. The eliminative argument is found in chapters VII\nthrough XI in Theory II. Yet Norris does offer a more\ndetailed account of abstract thought (which is an intellectual\nperception of God) than does Malebranche. Norris meticulously conveys\nhow we come to have knowledge of the essences of created things. God\nis revealed through degrees of being (i.e. divine ideas), such as the\ndegrees of being exhibited by bodies and minds, and we can come to\nknow their essences by attending carefully to our perceptions of\ndivine ideas. Careful attention requires thinking abstractly for\nNorris, and Norris offers us a definition of abstraction:\n\nSo that in short, Abstraction, as \u2018tis a logical Affection of\nThought, is the considering one thing without another, not\nabsolutely, but in things that are not really one without the\nother, nor yet really deniable one of the other. For Abstraction is,\nas it were, the drawing away of a thing from it self. But where things\nare really separate or distinct, the considering them apart is not\nAbstraction, but only mere divided Consideration. (Theory\nII 174)\n\n\nAbstraction serves to make the intellect\u2019s \u201cView of things more\nclear and distinct. As Spectacles, tho\u2019 in him that uses them they\nargue weakness of Sight, yet when used they do very much assist the\nAct of Vision\u201d (176\u2013177). Abstraction is the key to\nunderstanding how we come to know about minds and bodies. When\nconsidering the ideas of body, we understand that\n\n...one and the same Substance, may have different Modes or Manners of\nbeing in itself, As the same Body may have Motion and Figure,\nor else different Figures\u2026For tho\u2019 there be a real Identity\nbetween Modes and the thing modefied, yet as Figure suppose may be\nconsider\u2019d without Body, so Body may be consider\u2019d without its Figure,\nor sometimes as having this Figure, sometimes as having that, just as\nit is in Dimensions. (22)\n\n\nThis sort of abstraction Norris calls \u201cmodal abstraction.\u201d\nSince we cannot imagine a body without some shape and some dimensions,\nshape and dimensions are determinables, or modes, of extension. Shape\nis not an independently existing thing, but is always a modification\nof an independently existing thing. Since Norris holds that our clear\nand distinct mental propositions track ideal propositions, we can\nconclude that shape and dimensions are not substances, but modes.\nModal abstraction turns out to underscore Norris\u2019 rehearsal of real\ndistinction. His account is noteworthy because it offers an\nalternative understanding of the real distinction proof. When we are\ncertain that the two items under consideration are not distinct by\nmodal abstraction, we can be sure the two items are really\ndistinct.\n3.2 Cartesian Real Distinction and Lockean Thinking Matter\n\nAnother question preoccupying the early moderns concerned the\nconstitution of the human being. Is the human being a union of an\nimmortal soul and a mortal body? Or is the human being a mere body\nwith mentality somehow added? Descartes, in connection with the\nversion of the real distinction proof in the Sixth\nMeditation, argues that we can know clearly and distinctly that a\nhuman being is a union of two really distinct substances, a soul and a\nbody. Locke, at 4.3.6 of the Essay, states we might be bodies\nwith thought superadded. Norris perceives Locke\u2019s hypothesis as\ncontradicting Cartesian real distinction, so he reestablishes real\ndistinction in his Theory II. His reconstruction of\nDescartes\u2019 proof begins with the realization that the distinction\nbetween the mind and body is not at all like the distinction between\nthe body and shape:\n\nAnd therefore from my being able to conceive a Thinking Being to be,\ntho\u2019 I should suppose extended Being not be, I conclude that the Ideas\nof these things are distinct not by modal Abstraction, as figured\nSubstance and moveable substance, but really and intirely distinct\nfrom one another, and independent one upon another, and that because\nthings whenever they are must be according to their Ideas.\n(29\u201330)\n\n\nThe fact that we can clearly and distinctly conceive of the body\nexisting without the mind and vice versa entails that the body is\nreally distinct from the mind. Ontological relationships are reflected\nin human thought when we are thinking clearly and distinctly, and if a\nmodal abstraction is present, we can be certain that the items under\nconsideration are the modes of a substance. On the other hand, when\none thing can be thought while considering the other as not existing,\nthe things are not modes after all, but really distinct substances.\nOtherwise, there is no criterion of intelligibility, and for Norris\n\u201call Truth is intelligible\u201d (30). If we do not accept the\nstandard of clarity and distinctness, no standard for human judgment\nremains.\n\nIn Cursory Reflections, Norris presses Locke about the nature\nof an idea. Locke\u2019s account of ideas as originating in sensation and\nreflection found at 2.1 of the  Essay is met by Norris with:\n\u201cThese indeed are pretty Smiling Sentences. But before\nwe go a step further I would willingly know of the Author what kind of\nthings these Ideas are which are thus let in at the Gate of the\nSenses\u201d (22). Norris infers that Lockean ideas must be either\nmental substances or modifications, and then presents difficulties for\neither option. For Norris, the foundation of intelligibility can never\nhave an empirical basis. The foundation must be the true nature of\nideas:\n\nWhat else need, and what else can be the immediate\nObject of our Understanding but the Divine Ideas, the Omniform\nEssence of God? This will open to us a plain intelligible Account\nof Human Understanding \u2026Here I can tell what an Idea\nis, viz. the Omniform Essence of God partially represented or\nexhibited, and how it comes to be united with my Mind. But as far for\nall other ways, I look upon them as desperate. (Cursory\nReflections 31)\n\n\nIn addition to the defense of real distinction, Norris questions\nLocke\u2019s suggestion that we might be thinking matter. Norris, along\nwith many of his contemporaries, questions the mechanisms by which\nmatter could be endowed with thought. Mary Astell, with whom Norris\ncorresponded, is as confounded when she wonders whether God \u201cmay\naccording to the good Pleasure of His Omnipotency, give it [a\ntriangle] a good speaking, a walking, or a\ndancing Faculty, and make it able to Eat and Drink\u201d\n(Christian Religion 254\u2013255, brackets added). Astell\u2019s\nassumption here is shared by Norris; things are what they are\naccording to their essences, which are determined by God\u2019s ideas.\nExtended bodies cannot reveal mental states through walking and\ndancing, only minds are capable of initiating such acts. Norris\nutilizes this assumption in one of his arguments against the thinking\nmatter hypothesis:\n\nIn other words, If a Thinking Being and an Extended Being be really\none Idea, that is\u2026if the very same Being be in Idea both\nThinking and Extended, however by us considered sometimes under one\nFormality, and sometimes under another, then the Production of a\nThinking Being would be also the Production of an Extended Being, and\nso they could not be produced apart. But we suppose them separately\nproduceable, and thence think we have reason to conclude that their\nIdeas are completely and intirely distinct Ideas, and not the same\nIdea incompletely considered. (Theory II 36\u201337)\n\n\nSince bodies are sometimes separately produced from minds, God does\nnot create them from the same idea. Body and mind are created from\ndifferent ideas; they have separate essences.\n\nWhereas Locke argues that the human being might, for all we know, be\nmatter with thought superadded, Norris claims in no uncertain terms\nthat the human being is a substantial union. However, Norris can only\nargue for his claim within his ideal philosophy, which Locke rejects.\nBut the grounds for rejection spring from the very view of\n\u2018idea\u2019 Locke espouses; an idea is generated and formed by\nsensation and reflection. This debate concerns, fundamentally, the\nontological status of ideas, and how far ideas can guarantee a\ncorrespondence to reality external to thought. In this debate, the\nreader can fully appreciate one main difference between Cartesian\nrationalism and Lockean empiricism in late 17th Century\nEngland. For Locke, propositions about ideas are themselves mere\nmental propositions. As such, their certainty does not guarantee\ntruth. For Norris, clear and distinct mental propositions reflect\nideal propositions. Certainty about mental propositions does guarantee\ntruth.\n\nNorris offers an important insight into how the real distinction proof\ndepends on abstractive processes. However, like Malebranche, Norris\nclaims that we have no access to God\u2019s idea of the mind. The mind\u2019s\nexistence is known only by inner consciousness, or sentiment. This\nraises the same problems for Norris that Malebranche has defending the\nproof. (See Nolan and Whipple 2005.) If humanity is ignorant about the\nessence of the soul, then there can be no proof using the essence of\nthe soul as a premise; we cannot know if the proposition, \u2018The\nmind is a substance\u2019, is true or false. At best, it is\nindeterminate. So, whether Norris can fully defend the proof is\nquestionable. Nonetheless, Norris argues for the immortality of the\nsoul in A Philosophical Discourse concerning the Natural\nImmortality of the Soul in response to a work published by Henry\nDodwell. Dodwell held that all souls are material, and only a few\nsouls are granted immortality. Norris, relying upon the essence of the\nsoul as immaterial, draws a distinction between the indissolvible and\nthe imperishable (33\u201334). The soul is naturally indissolvible\nbecause it is indivisible, but it is not imperishable. If God ceased\nhis constant creation, all things would immediately cease to\nexist.\n\nNorris dedicates a chapter in Theory II to the topic of\nanimals. Descartes and Malebranche had held that animals are mere\nmachines. Norris agrees there are good reasons to believe that animals\nare machines, but it is possible that they have souls because\n\u201c\u2019tis easy to err in the Dark.\u201d Norris discourages\n\u201cany practices of Cruelty, upon the Bodies of these Creatures,\nwhich the Lord of Creation has\u2026subjected to our Power.\u201d\nHe advises us to treat animals \u201cwith as much tenderness and\npitiful regard, as if they had all that Sense and Perception, which is\ncommonly\u2026attributed to them\u201d (100).\n4. Religious, Practical and Political Views\n\nA recurring theme in Norris\u2019 writings is the importance of solitude\nand meditation. Christianity, for Norris, was a highly personal\nrelationship with one\u2019s God. Being a good Christian involves the\nopening of one\u2019s mind to a comprehension of God. \u201cFor Passion is\nthe great Contrariety to Reason, and will draw a cloud over the\nbrightest Mind. The quiet and sedate Soul is most fit for the\nContemplation of Truth, as the calmest Weather is commonly the most\nserene\u201d (Two Treatises in Treatises upon Several\nSubjects 353).\n\nOne truth the meditative Christian comes to understand is that God is\nlove. Norris believes love is a natural tendency of the soul, and\nanalogizes love to motion in The Theory and Regulation of\nLove. There he writes: \u201cSo that upon the whole to speak\nmore explicitly the most general and Comprehensive Notion of\nLove will be found to be, a motion of the Soul towards\nGod\u201d (12). Regarding the objects of love, one can love the\ngeneral, universal good, viz. God, or particular goods, which reflect\nthe goodness of God, \u201cFor God having unfolded his Perfections in\nthe Creation with almost infinite Variety, and as it were drawn out\nhimself into a numerous issue of Secondary goods, our Love\nbecomes also Multiplied\u201d (12). Regarding the act of love, one\ncan love with benevolence or with desire. Concupiscence, or loving\nwith desire, is a general tendency towards good. Benevolent love is\nwilling a specific good for a person. Benevolent love is further\ndivided into self-love and other-love, which Norris also calls the\n\u201clove of charity.\u201d All concupiscence proceeds from\nindigence so it is rooted in self-love, whereas love of charity does\nnot have to proceed from self-love. He explains why God is a\nnarcissistic God: \u201cFor as GOD is to himself his own good, his\nown Center and Beatifick Object, so the Love of GOD can be no other\nthan Love of himself\u201d (Letters 226). Since God wants\nnothing, God cannot exhibit concupiscence, but only love of charity\nfor humanity. The correct object of our love is also God, especially\ngiven the occasionalism thesis that God is the genuine cause of all\nthe secondary goods we might desire. It is only in God that one finds\nfull satisfaction of desire, \u201che is also the true final Cause of\nthe Will of Man; which I take to be nothing else but that continual\nImpression whereby the Author of Nature moves him towards\nhimself\u201d (227). It is important to keep in mind that God is\ninfinite love; echoing again the Thomistic theme running throughout\nNorris\u2019 works, it is impossible to understand exactly how God\nloves.\n\nContrary to this Thomistic theme, the Socinians believed all Christian\ndoctrine should be comprehensible. Socinianism was advanced in John\nToland\u2019s 1696 Christianity not Mysterious. Socinianism\nrejected inexplicable Christian doctrine, such as the divinity of\nChrist as man. Norris believed Socinianism to be a dangerous view\nbecause it leads to either deism or atheism. This threatening\nentailment led him to respond to the doctrine in An Account of\nReason and Faith, which he published in 1697. In the piece,\nNorris defines some truths as above reason, such as the existence of\nthe Trinity. Other claims are blatantly \u201cContrary to Reason when\nwe do positively comprehend that it cannot be\u201d (117); these\nclaims should be rejected. However, there are many claims we should\nnot reject so quickly:\n\nYou know very well that in the great Problem of the Divisibility of\nQuantity there are Incomprehensibilities on both sides, it being\ninconceivable that Quantity should, and it being also inconceivable\nthat it should not be divided infinitely. And yet you know again that\nas being parts of a Contradiction one of them must necessarily be\ntrue. Possibly you may not be able with the utmost Certainty and\nwithout all hesitation to determine which that is, but however you\nknow in the general that One of them, indeterminately, must be true.\n(322)\n\n\nNeither option presents itself as true, but Norris proceeds to ask the\nSocinian if he would accept it as an article of faith if God were to\nreveal the correct option. Human ignorance does not entail falsity.\nMoreover, human ignorance does not entail divine ignorance just as a\nneophyte mathematician\u2019s inability to demonstrate \u201cthe\nDiameter of a Square is incommensurable to the Side\u201d does\nnot entail the lack of a demonstration (321). Norris concludes that\nthe Socinians improperly hold the human intellect to be the standard\nfor truth. Truth is understood and determined by God, who possesses an\ninfinite intellect. The fact that the Trinity is incomprehensible does\nnot warrant its rejection:\n\nYou have our leave to suppose it as incomprehensible as you please.\nBut then you are to Consider\u2026that this is a Revelation of God\nconcerning Himself, and do you pretend to Comprehend the\nNature and Essence of God? If you do, then your Understanding is as\ninfinite as the Divine. But if you do not, then the\nincomprehensibility of this Mysterious Article ought to be no\nObjection with you against the Belief of it, since if it be, you must\nbe driven to say that you Comprehend the Nature of God, which I hope\nyou have too much Religion as well as Reason to affirm.\n(324\u2013325)\n\n\nReason is reliable, but limited. The Socinians have gone too far in\ntheir support of reason. On the other hand, Norris believes that the\nQuakers have gone too far in the other direction.\n\nNorris was familiar with Roger Barclay and George Keith\u2019s expositions\nof Quakerism, and argued against the view in Reflections upon the\nConduct of Human Life. The Quakers had an affinity for the ideal\nphilosophy because they believed the divine light that enlightens the\nhuman mind supported their view. Norris delineates the many\ndifferences between Quaker thought and his own, but perhaps the main\ndifference is: \u201cThe Quakers represent this light within as a\nsort of Extraordinary Inspiration (whence they have the name\nof Enthusiasts) whereas I suppose it to be a Man\u2019s\nNatural and Ordinary way of Understanding\u201d\n(Two Treatises 365). Also, Norris identifies their\ninspiration as limited to moral and spiritual truths. Norris also\nconcludes that the Quakers render the divine light a creature because\nit cannot be God on the Quakers\u2019 view. God and creatures are the only\ntwo possibilities for existing things, hence, the divine light of the\nQuakers is a creature. Also, the divine light must be considered\nmaterial since it is described as a \u201cVehiculum\nDei\u201d and it is \u201cdivisible into Measures and\nPortions\u201d (437). These attributes cannot be maintained;\ndivisibility and motion cannot \u201cwith any tolerable Congruity\nagree to a Spiritual Substance, strictly so call\u2019d\u201d (438).\nFinally, Norris argues that the Quakers\u2019 divine light is contingent\nbecause it is a creature, so it cannot convey necessary and eternal\ntruths; only an infinite being can be the source of the eternal truths\n(453\u2013454). The proper way to live a good Christian life, morally\nand intellectually, is to engage one\u2019s intellect, \u201cthe greatest\nadvantage of thinking is yet behind, that it improves our Morals as\nwell as our Intellectuals; and serves to make us Better, as well as\nWiser\u201d (Miscellanies 151). The Quakers, by emphasizing\nthe passions, takes the Christian far from the intelligible world.\n\nNorris also believed that the Quakers were guilty of the sin of\nschism. Certain nonconformist Christian groups were exempted from\nprosecution by the Toleration Act of 1689, and the Quakers were\namongst these. Norris firmly believed that schism from the Anglican\nChurch was a sin, and believed the Toleration Act merely removed the\nearthly punishment. In The Charge of Schism Continued, Norris\ncites Ephesians 4.3\u20136, and emphasizes St. Paul\u2019s words\nto the Ephesians to preserve unity. God commands unity, and schism is\na sin where there is an established Church. Norris divides a law into\na preceptive and a punitive element. The basis of the punishment is\nthe rationale of a law, or the preceptive aspect of a law. The\nToleration Act merely removes the punitive aspect, leaving the\nrationale of the law, which is God\u2019s commandment. Furthermore, the\njustification of all human law lies in divine law, \u201cIf it be\nfurther askt, whence has the Law-giver his Authority? I answer, if he\nbe a Creature, he has it from God, whom I suppose to be the sole\nFountain of all Power. But if the Law-giver be God, he has it\nOriginally and Independently in himself\u201d (The Charge\n312). Norris held the Toleration Act to be a violation of divine\nlaw.\n\nOther than his writings on toleration, his sole other published\npolitical work is A Murnival of Knaves issued in 1683 against\nthe Parliamentarians. Norris was a Royalist, but he was not much\nengaged in the volatile politics of his day. A poem in his\nMiscellanies reveals his attitude towards politics:\n\nNO, I shan\u2019t envy him whoe\u2019er he be\n\nThat stand upon the Battlements of State,\n\nStand there who will for me,\n\nI\u2019d rather be secure than great.\n\nOf being so high the pleasure is but small,\n\nBut long the Ruine if I chance to fall. (29)\n\n\nThe ruination of one\u2019s soul for the chance to achieve temporary\ngreatness runs against Norris\u2019 basic convictions, the foremost of\nwhich was a life dedicated to the service of God focused upon the\nafterlife. This dearth of political writings reveals a philosopher who\nengaged in intellectual activity because it reveals an orderly\nuniverse governed by the Christian God. Humility is also an important\nvirtue for the Christian, as Norris explains in A Practical\nTreatise concerning Humility published in 1707. In Creation,\nhumanity has a humble role to play \u2013 to love and serve God.\nPolitical and intellectual endeavors are tools to achieve that end.\nAll human thought and institutions should be utilized to serve God\u2019s\npurposes. This theme is also reflected in Norris\u2019 1705 The\nDistinction between High Church and Low Church, distinctly considered\nand fairly treated.\n5. Concluding Notes\n\nNorris integrates the thought of his predecessors\u2014Descartes,\nMalebranche, Suarez, Augustine, Aquinas and Plato\u2014in a manner\ncentering on the Christian God. God is truth, love and the aim of all\nreligious and practical life. Norris\u2019 ambition of completing\nMalebranche\u2019s project is reflected in his arguments to establish the\nexistence of the divine ideas and their locus in the mind of God, or\nthe intelligible world. His detailed discussion of the eternal truths\nis a further expansion upon Malebranche\u2019s philosophy. The defense of\nDescartes\u2019 real distinction proof is enlightening because it renders\ntransparent the assumption of abstractive knowledge that might have\naided contemporary readers\u2019 understanding of the proof. If Norris did\nnot venture further into the philosophical, political and scientific\ndebates of his own time, the explanation lies in his advice to never\nstudy out of vanity. Worldly knowledge, such as knowledge of history\nor languages, is a waste of one\u2019s time. Norris was dedicated to the\ncause of knowledge for Christianity\u2019s sake, and he saw his own work,\nas well as his predecessors\u2019, as attempting to realize fully knowledge\nof the Pauline Doctrine, stated at Acts 17:28, that in God\n\u201cwe live, move and have our being.\u201d\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Astell, Mary, <em>The Christian Religion, as profes\u2019d by a\nDaughter of the Church of England</em>, London: S.
