    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || Skepticism and Aureoli\n4.2 Skepticism and Aureoli\n\nWodeham\u2019s decision to identify the difference between intuitive\nand abstractive knowledge with the presence or absence of an object,\nas Scotus and Ockham did, meant that he shared with these two thinkers\na common opponent, namely Peter Aureoli. In response to Scotus\u2019s\ndefinition of intuitive knowledge Aureoli identified several\nexperiences wherein a person appears to have a sensitive intuition of\na non-present object. Such experiences, according to Aureoli, were the\nconsequence of lingering sensitive images that remain even after an\nobject is no longer present. Such lingering images (sometimes called\nesse perspectivum or esse apparens) were used to\nexplain all sorts of visual anomalies that do not correspond to\nreality. Such experiences were enough for Aureoli to define intuitive\nknowledge, not as the direct grasp of a present object, but as\ndirect knowledge (as opposed to knowledge arrived at through\na discursive reasoning process). Rega Wood explains:\n\n\nAbstract and intuitive cognition were distinguished by the manner in\nwhich their objects were presented. The objects of abstract cognition\nappeared in a quasi-imaginary mode (quasi modo imaginario et\nabsente); intuitive cognition was direct rather than discursive,\nand it conveyed the impression that its objects existed and were\nactually present (Wood 1982, 216).\n\n\nIn short, this meant that a direct grasp of a lingering appearance or\nesse apparens, even after the object was no longer present,\ncould count as intuitive knowledge.\n\nFor those who came after Aureoli, his definition and his notion of\nesse apparens raised a host of skeptical concerns. If\nsensation produces an esse apparens, the intellect must also\nproduce a similar object, something Peter Aureoli called esse\nintentionale. And if intuitive knowledge is a direct knowledge of\neither the esse apparens or the esse intentionale,\nand not of the object itself, from where does the certainty come by\nwhich one can firmly and confidently state that \u201cthis thing\nexists\u201d? Aureoli\u2019s esse apparens opened up the\npossibility of an experience, wherein what appears to be present,\nmight actually not be present or even in existence.\n\nOckham\u2019s answer to Aureoli\u2019s insistence on the need for an\nesse apparens to explain certain strange and misleading\nphenomena was to relocate the source of the error. The error does not\ncome from the impression of some non-existent object. On the contrary,\nthe naturally produced intuitive cognition does not lie. Instead, as\nWood paraphrases Ockham, \u201cerror arises when the observer infers\na proposition which does not follow formally from his\nperceptions\u201d (Wood 1982, 224). Ockham calls the intuition of\nthose appearances that cause apparitions \u201cimperfect intuitive\ncognition\u201d. In such cases, the immediate judgment of the\nintellect is not \u201cthat the object represented exists\u201d, but\n\u201cthat the object was impressed\u201d (and, it would seem, that\nthis impression exists). The intellect errs, then, when it assents to\nwhat the \u201cimperfect\u201d intuition does not warrant.\n\nA central concern with Ockham\u2019s account, raised by Walter\nChatton and responded to by Wodeham, was the character of these\napparition causing \u201cafter-images\u201d. For Ockham, the after\nimages were not caused by the object, but by a lingering impression\ndistinct from the object or impression-causing species. For Chatton,\nit could not be overlooked that these after-images appeared as\nif they were the object, not as if they were some\nleft-over impression caused by the object. Thus, he argued that the\nafter-images are caused by the lingering of the representative species\nof the object, even after the object is no longer present. Chatton was\ntherefore willing to admit that intuition of a non-present object was\npossible, as long as its representative species lingered.\n\nOn this issue Wodeham takes sides with Ockham against Chatton. He\nexpressly attacks Chatton\u2019s description of the lingering species\nas having a likeness sufficient to cause the observer to believe in\nthe existence of the original object. Wood writes of Wodeham\u2019s\nposition:\n\n\nIn after-images only the remains of the form or species caused by the\nfirst act of perception are seen. But the belief that the principal\nobject is seen when after-images are present is not caused by the\nfirst vision or even by the remains of the species imprinted during\nvision. It is caused by strong imagination which leads the observer to\njudge falsely that what he sees in an after-image is the same as what\nhe saw when the principal object was presented (Wood 1982, 228).\n\n\nIn short, against Chatton, Wodeham defends an Ockham-like position,\nsuggesting that the source of error is not the intuitive cognition of\nsomething not actually there, but the fact that the intellect chooses\nto make a judgment about the existence of something other than what\nwas intuited. In many ways, the case is similar to that inference made\nabout Socrates\u2019 non-existence, when Socrates\u2019 dead body is\nintuitively grasped. The inference made from one intuitive cognition\nis not always correct, even if the intuition itself remains\nreliable.\n",
