    "main_text": "Heterogeneous Naturalism || Is Mathematics Methodologically Autonomous?\n5.1 Is Mathematics Methodologically Autonomous?\n\n\nMaddy claims that the correct model of mathematical justification\nwill vindicate the hypothesis that traditionally scientific or\nphilosophical arguments do not enter into the justification of\nmathematical statements. For example, the French analysts Baire, Borel\nand Lebesgue criticised the Axiom of Choice on the basis of a\ndefinabilist methodology, according to which the existence of an object\ndepends on its definability: functions should be definable rules,\nmembership of a set should given in a definable way, etc. But\ndefinabilism ended up having no influence on the practice of\nmathematics, and its sympathisers were silenced or gave up on it when\nits mathematically undesirable features became clear. For example,\nthe Axiom of Choice allows the taking of maximal ideals in rings and\nother structures; it entails the kinds of maximality principles that even the analysts were\nalready using; it simplifies transfinite arithmetic; and despite its\nsuspicious abstractness it turns out to be equivalent to\n\u2018concrete\u2019 and \u2018mathematical\u2019 statements such\nas the claim that every vector space has a basis. The reasons for\naccepting the Axiom of Choice were in the end purely mathematical.\n\n\nMaddy also offers an admirably detailed account of the kinds of\nmathematical reasons that militate against the \u2018Axiom\u2019 of\nConstructibility, V = L, in particular the fact that its adoption goes\nagainst the set-theoretical maxim MAXIMIZE, which enjoins that\nthe universe of sets should be as expansive as possible (by containing\nas many isomorphism types as possible).\n\n\nMost commentators have let the descriptive component of\nMaddy's naturalism, the autonomy thesis, pass, focusing criticism\ninstead on its normative implications. Yet the autonomy thesis is very\nradical. The usual picture of the interaction between mathematics and\nphilosophy is of a two-way street. In particular, it is usually thought\nthat philosophy impinges to some degree on mathematical practice.\nIntuitionists for example take the dependence to be profound: they think that all of mathematical practice rests on a false philosophical\nfoundation and that once that foundation is removed, mathematics\ntotters.\n\n\nMaddy willingly concedes that philosophical doctrines such as\ndefinabilism or realism are important inspirations for mathematical\ndevelopment even if they fall short of justifications (1997, 192).\nAnd she accepts that \u201ctheories of mathematical truth or\nexistence or knowledge do in fact appear in most mathematical debates\nover proper methods, alongside more typically mathematical\nconsiderations\u201d (2007, 348). But she maintains that such\ntheories have not in the end played an \u2018instrumental role\u2019\n(2007, 359), and that they have racked up a \u2018track record of\nirrelevance\u2019 (2007, 366) in the development of mathematics.\n\n\nSo do philosophical (or more generally\nnon-mathematical) considerations always fall on the side of inspiration\nrather than justification? Well, philosophical considerations are\nhardly ever advanced in mathematical journals or books. And whenever\nthey are Maddy sees them as amounting, when one scratches the surface,\nto \u2018intra-mathematical\u2019 arguments (1997, 193), of which a\nnaturalized model of the practice would be \u2018purified\u2019,\nbecause of their methodological irrelevance (1997, 197). If she is right, this reply generalises from this particular, rather restricted, type of context to all mathematical contexts.\n\n\nOne of the implications of this view is that the kinds of\nmaxims Maddy sees as purely internal to mathematics, such as\nMAXIMIZE or UNIFY, are never themselves underlain by\nphilosophical beliefs. UNIFY is a methodological consequence\nof set theory's foundational ambition of providing \u2018a\nsingle system in which all objects and structures of mathematics can be\nmodelled or instantiated\u2019 (1997, 208\u20139). Yet perhaps\nUNIFY and set theory's foundational ambition\u2014the\nfact that as Maddy correctly observes, \u201cset theory is (at least\npartly) designed to provide a foundation for classical\nmathematics\u201d (2007, 355)\u2014are themselves in some small\nway, perhaps to some slight degree, underpinned by set-theoretic\nrealism, i.e., the view that set theory is about a single universe of\nsets. Likewise for the Axiom of Choice, which on the surface owes its\nplace in the set-theoretic canon partly\u2014perhaps only to a small\ndegree\u2014to an ingrained realism about set theory. Several set\ntheorists are on record as making claims to that effect, so the burden\nof proof is on Maddy to explain away these remarks.\n\n\nMaddy also employs the following problematic style of argument. She\nthinks that the fact that philosophical debates (e.g., about realism)\nare wide open but that mathematics has developed in a particular way\n(e.g., to allow impredicative methods) shows that philosophical debates\nhave not affected the outcome of modern mathematics (e.g., 2007, \n348). But the fact that a debate about realism is wide open in\nphilosophy does not mean that it is wide open in mathematics. Perhaps\nmathematicians have implicitly taken a realist stance, which in part\nunderlies their acceptance of impredicativity, even as philosophers\ncontinue to debate the correctness of realism as a philosophy of\nmathematics. Mathematics may be philosophically parti pris,\nwhich is why it has developed the way it has.\n\n\nThese points against the autonomy thesis are hardly conclusive. To\nevaluate it, greater clarity is required on where the boundary between\njustification and inspiration lies and what exactly it means to say that something falls on one side or the other. And of course we then need to identify more precisely\nwhich of the factors in the evolution of mathematics are justificationally operative and\nwhich idle. However, even if the autonomy thesis is not true,\nperhaps it is almost true. And perhaps nothing quite as strong as an\nautonomy thesis is required to support trumping as opposed to\nbiconditional naturalism.\n",
