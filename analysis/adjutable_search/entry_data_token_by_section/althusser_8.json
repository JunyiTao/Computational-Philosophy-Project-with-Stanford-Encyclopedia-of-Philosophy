    "main_text": "Classic Work (1961\u20131966) || Epistemology and Philosophy of Science\n3.2 Epistemology and Philosophy of Science\n\nWith his re-reading of Marx, Althusser wished to offer an alternative\nto the two then dominant understandings of Marx\u2019s philosophy.\nBoth understandings were charged with the same mistake. This mistake\nwas, fundamentally, an epistemological one: each cast Marx as an\nempiricist. At first glance, this charge might seem ridiculous. This\nis especially the case as, according to Althusser\u2019s own\ncritique, both understandings of Marx offered variants of the Hegelian\nclaim that there is a reason to history. For Althusser, however, both\nreadings were \u201cempiricist\u201d inasmuch as each ascribed to\nMarx a theory of knowledge in which the subject, by means of a process\nof observation and abstraction, comes to know what an object really\nand truly is, according to its essence. This is a definition of\nempiricism meant to include philosophers as diverse as Locke, Kant,\nand Hegel and traditions as varied as British Empiricism, German\nIdealism, Positivism, and Pragmatism. In the case of Humanist Marxism,\nthe object that comes to be known by its essence is the human subject\nin its full freedom. It does so by means of critique and by creatively\novercoming that which is alien to it or \u201cmerely\nhistorical.\u201d In the case of orthodox Marxism-Leninism, this\nobject is the economy, the reality that underlies, causes, and can\nexplain all historical structures and transformations. The economy\ncomes to be known as it truly is only by the proletariat, by those\nwhom the historical process has endowed with an objective gaze and who\npossess the ability to make this truth objective.\n\nIn opposition to the empiricist model of knowledge production,\nAlthusser proposes that true or scientific knowledge is distinguished\nfrom ideology or opinion not by dint of an historical subject having\nabstracted the essence of an object from its appearances. Instead,\nthis knowledge is understood to be produced by a process internal to\nscientific knowledge itself. Though this transformation takes place\nentirely in thought, Althusser does not maintain that scientific\nknowledge makes no use of facts. However, these facts or materials are\nnever brute. Rather, specific sciences start with pre-existing\nconcepts or genera such as \u201chumors,\u201d\n\u201cunemployment,\u201d \u201cquasars,\u201d or\n\u201cirrational numbers.\u201d These genera may be ideological in\npart or in whole. Science\u2019s job is to render these concepts\nscientific. This labor is what Althusser terms \u201ctheoretical\npractice.\u201d The result of this practice is scientific knowledge.\nScientific knowledge is produced by means of applying to these genera\nthe body of concepts or \u201ctheory\u201d that the science\npossesses for understanding them. This body of concepts may be more or\nless unified and consistent and it may be more or less consciously\narticulated. Further, the sum of the individual concepts that this\ntheory consists of delimits the possible ways in which the genera that\na science begins with can be understood.\n\nWhen applied, a science\u2019s theory weeds out ideological notions\nassociated with the original concept or genera. The result of this\napplication of theory to genera is the transformation of the\n\u201cideological generality into a scientific generality\u201d\n(1963b [2005], 185). An example of such a process is the\ntransformation in medical science of a concept like \u201cphlegmatic\nhumors\u201d into the idea of blood-borne pathogens by dint of the\ntheory of circulation and infectious disease. Once generated, such\nscientific concepts inform regular scientific practice, allowing\nspecific research programs within an individual science to progress.\nAlthusser himself gives examples of three such major transformations.\nThe first is the founding of modern physics by Galileo, the other that\nof Greek mathematics, and the third, that of Marx\u2019s founding of\nthe science of Historical Materialism out of Classical Political\nEconomy. Each of these foundings is marked by what Althusser terms an\n\u201cepistemological break,\u201d or a period when ideological\nconcepts are replaced by scientific ones. Any similarity here to\nKuhnian ideas about revolutionary and normal science is not\nsurprising. Both Canguilhem and Bachelard, from whom Althusser drew\ninspiration for his theory, were part of a dialogue that took in the\nwork of Alexander Koyr\u00e9 on scientific revolutions, a thinker\nfrom whom Kuhn, in turn, drew his inspiration.\n\nAlthusser\u2019s debt to the tradition of French historical\nepistemology in this account of knowledge production and philosophy of\nscience should now be evident. However, this epistemology\u2019s\nMarxian and Spinozistic elements may be less pronounced. The\nvocabulary adopted above to express this theory, however, gestures to\nboth influences. For Althusser, Marx\u2019s founding of the science\nof history is crucial not only to politics (as will be addressed\nbelow) but also to understanding all of human activity, including\nscientific activity. That there is a circular logic to this\nepistemological theory, Althusser readily admits, for it is only the\nscience of Historical Materialism that allows us to understand\nscientific practice in general. Althusser, though, is comfortable with\nthis circularity. This is because, insofar as this understanding of\nscientific practice in general allows us to understand how individual\nsciences produce their knowledge, Historical Materialism is a science\nthat functions like any other.\n\nFor Althusser, the concept that helps to produce this understanding of\nscientific practices is that of the \u201cmode of production.\u201d\nWith it, he argues, Marx supplied theorists with an idea sufficient to\ncomprehend the way in which we materially produce our selves, our\nenvironments, our knowledges, and our histories. Indeed, this concept\nmakes it possible to analyze all of our activities in their\nspecificity and to understand them in their relation to the totality\nof which they are a part. As it must be if we are to make sense of\nscientific practice as one aspect of the total mode of production,\nmuch more than the activity of economic production must be included in\nthis totality of productive practices. Added by Althusser to these two\naspects of the mode of production are those of ideological, political,\nand philosophical production, among others.\n\nIn each of the practices that together comprise, at any given time, a\nspecific mode of production, some form or forms of labor uses the\nexisting means of production to transform existing materials into new\nproducts. According to Althusser, this realization is Marx\u2019s\nbasic insight. In scientific production, for example, thinkers use\nexisting theories to transform existing concepts into new, scientific\nconcepts. However, and this is where Althusser\u2019s Spinozism\nbecomes apparent and also where he breaks with economistic\nunderstandings of Marx, it is not the case that the analysis of any\none mode of production within the totality of productive practices is\ncapable of generating an understanding of the way in which all rest of\nthe productive processes are causally determined. Rather, and in line\nwith the parallelism attributed by Leibniz to Spinoza, as each\nproductive process transforms a unique material (concepts in science,\ngoods in economics, social relations in politics), each process can\nonly be understood in terms of its unique causal structure. In\naddition, and again also in a way similar to Spinoza\u2019s account\nof substance as seen from different aspects, each productive process\nis understood to stand in relation to and play a part of a complexly\nstructured whole, none of which is reducible to being the simple or\nessential cause of the others.\n\nThat Althusser regards most, if not all, human activity as consisting\nof material processes of production and reproduction can be used as a\nkey to understanding other parts of his philosophy. These include his\nthoughts on the structure of the social and political world, the\nhistorical process, and philosophy. As philosophy is closely related\nto science and because it is charged with a task that allows the\nproduction of knowledge about the other socio-economic practices to be\ngenerated, it is probably best to start with Althusser\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy as a material practice of production\nbefore proceeding to a discussion of how Althusser understands the\nother practices listed above.\n",
