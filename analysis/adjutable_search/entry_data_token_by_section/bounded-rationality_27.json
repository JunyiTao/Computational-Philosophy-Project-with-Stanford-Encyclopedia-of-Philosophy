Yet \u2018rationality\u2019 is\nwhat Marvin Minsky called a suitcase word, a term that needs to be\nunpacked before getting anywhere.\n\nOne meaning, central to decision theory, is coherence, which\nis merely the requirement that your commitments not be self-defeating.\nThe subjective Bayesian representation of rational preference over\noptions as inequalities in subjective expected utility delivers\ncoherence by applying a dominance principle to (suitably structured)\npreferences. A closely related application of dominance reasoning is\nthe minimization of expected loss (or maximization of expected gain in\neconomics) according to a suitable loss function, which may even be\nasymmetric (Elliott, Komunjer, & Timmermann 2005) or applied to\nradically restricted agents, such as finite automata (Rubinstein\n1986). Coherence and dominance reasoning underpin expected utility\ntheory\n (section 1.1),\n too.\n\nA second meaning of rationality refers to an interpretive stance or\ndisposition that we take to understand the beliefs, desires, and\nactions of another person (Dennett 1971) or to understand anything\nthey might say in a shared language (Davidson 1974). On this view,\nrationality refers to a bundle of assumptions we grant to another\nperson in order to understand their behavior, including speech. When\nwe offer a reason-giving explanation for another person\u2019s\nbehavior, we take such a stance. If I say \u201cthe driver\nlaughed because she made a joke\u201d you would not get far in\nunderstanding me without granting to me, and even this imaginary\ndriver and woman, a lot. So, in contrast to the lofty normative\nstandards of coherence that few if any mortals meet, the standards of\nrationality associated with an interpretive stance are met by\npractically everyone.\n\nA third meaning of rationality, due to Hume (1738), applies to your\nbeliefs, appraising them in how well they are calibrated with your\nexperience. If in your experience the existence of one thing is\ninvariably followed by an experience of another, then believing that\nthe latter follows the former is rational. We might even go so far as\nto say that your expectation of the latter given your experience of\nthe former is rational. This view of rationality is an evaluation of a\nperson\u2019s commitments, like coherence standards; but unlike\ncoherence, Hume\u2019s notion of rationality seeks to tie the\nrational standing of a belief directly to evidence from the world.\nMuch of contemporary epistemology endorses this concept of rationality\nwhile attempting to specify the conditions under which we can\ncorrectly attribute knowledge to someone.\n\nA fourth meaning of rationality, called substantive\nrationality by Max Weber (1905), applies to the evaluation of\nyour aims of inquiry. Substantive rationality invokes a Kantian\ndistinction between the worthiness of a goal, on the one hand, and how\nwell you perform instrumentally in achieving that goal, on the other.\nAiming to count the blades of grass in your lawn is arguably not a\nrational end to pursue, even if you were to use the instruments of\nrationality flawlessly to arrive at the correct count.\n\nA fifth meaning of rationality, due to Peirce (1955) and taken up by\nthe American pragmatists, applies to the process of changing a belief\nrather than the Humean appraisal of a currently held belief. On\nPeirce\u2019s view, people are plagued by doubt not by belief; we\ndon\u2019t expend effort testing the sturdiness of our beliefs, but\nrather focus on those that come into doubt. Since inquiry is pursued\nto remove the doubts we have, not certify the stable beliefs we\nalready possess, principles of rationality ought to apply to the\nmethods for removing doubt (Dewey 1960). On this view, questions of\nwhat is or is not substantively rational will be answered by the\ninquirer: for an agronomist interested in grass cover sufficient to\ncrowd out an invasive weed, obtaining the grass-blade count of a lawn\nmight be a substantively rational aim to pursue.\n\nA sixth meaning of rationality appeals to an organism\u2019s\ncapacities to assimilate and exploit complex information and revise or\nmodify it when it is no longer suited to task. The object of\nrationality according to this notion is effective behavior.\nJonathan Bennett discusses this notion of rationality in his case\nstudy of bees:\n\n\nAll our prima facie cases of rationality or intelligence were\nbased on the observation that some creature\u2019s behaviour was in\ncertain dependable ways successful or appropriate or apt, relative to\nits presumed wants or needs. \u2026There are canons of\nappropriateness whereby we can ask whether an apian act is appropriate\nnot to that which is particular and present to the bee but rather to\nthat which is particular and past or to that which is not particular\nat all but universal. (Bennett 1964: 85)\n\n\nLike Hume\u2019s conception, Bennett\u2019s view ties rationality to\nsuccessful interactions with the world. Further, like the pragmatists,\nBennett includes for appraisal the dynamic process rather than simply\nthe synchronic state of one\u2019s commitments or the current merits\nof a goal. But unlike the pragmatists, Bennett conceives of\nrationality to apply to a wider range of behavior than the logic of\ndeliberation, inquiry, and belief change.\n\nA seventh meaning of rationality resembles the notion of coherence by\ndefining rationality as the absence of a defect. For Bayesians,\nsure-loss is the epitome of irrationality and coherence is\nsimply its absence. Sorensen has suggested a generalization of this\nstrategy, one where rationality is conceived as the absence of\nirrationality tout court, just as cleanliness is the absence\nof dirt. Yet, owing to the long and varied ways that irrationality can\narise, a consequence of this view is that there then would be no\nunified notion of rationality to capture the idea of thinking as one\nought to think (Sorensen 1991).\n\nThese seven accounts of rationality are neither exhaustive nor\ncomplete. But they suffice to illustrate the range of differences\namong rationality concepts, from the objects of evaluation and the\nstandards of assessment, to the roles, if any at all, that rationality\nis conceived to play in reasoning, planning, deliberation,\nexplanation, prediction, signaling, and interpretation. One\nconsequence of this hodgepodge of rationality concepts is a pliancy in\nthe attribution of irrationality that resembles Victorian methods for\ndiagnosing the vapors. The time may have come to retire talk of\nrationality altogether, or to demand a specification of the objects of\nevaluation, the normative standards to be used for assessment, and\nrequire ample attention to the implications that follow from those\ncommitments.\n",
