    "main_text": "The Development of Conservative Thought || \u201cRational\u201d or Idealist conservatism\n2.4 \u201cRational\u201d or Idealist conservatism\n\nBurkean conservatism influenced Continental European traditions, but\nthese also had a separate development. Indeed, as Clark argues, his\ncontinental admirers were normally ignorant of Burke\u2019s background as a\nWhig constitutionalist, and saw him as merely the most eloquent critic\nof Jacobinism: \u201cIn Germany, constitutionalism became a liberal\nrather than a conservative ideology, standing for revolution rather\nthan for the anti-libertarian, holistic views of order and authority\nwith which German admirers wrongly associated Burke\u201d (Clark,\n2001: 106).\n\nDe Tocqueville (1805\u201359) was probably the most Burkean among\n19th century Continental conservatives in his condemnation\nof the French Revolution:\n\n\nOur revolutionaries had the same fondness for broad generalisations,\ncut-and-dried legislative systems, and a pedantic symmetry; the same\ncontempt for hard facts; the same taste for reshaping institutions on\nnovel, ingenious, original lines\u2026[for reconstructing] the\nentire system instead of trying to rectify its faulty parts. (1955\n[1856]: 147)\n\n\nTocqueville rejected Burke\u2019s view that the French monarchy was\nreformable; for him, \u201cmonarchical absolutism had wiped clean the\nslate of French society and thereby provided the basis for the new\nabsolutism of the Revolution\u201d (Clark, 2001: 78). His\nL\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime et al R\u00e9volution was partly written to\nrefute Burke.\n\nIn Germany, Burke\u2019s Reflections were translated three\ntimes before 1793, implying an influence on such conservatives as\nGentz, Rehberg and Brandes. (Though Beiser (1992) argues that they\narrived at their position independently.) August Wilhelm Rehberg\n(1757\u20131836) was a founder of German reformist conservatism,\nwhose penetrating critique of the French Revolution bears striking\nsimilarities to Burke\u2019s (see the entry on\n August Rehberg,\n sections 3 and 4). The historians von Savigny (1779\u20131861) and\nvon Ranke (1795\u20131886) assumed a Burkean organic development of\nsocieties. German conservatives adopted positions from reformism to\nreaction, aiming to contain democratic forces\u2014though not all of\nthem were opposed to the Aufkl\u00e4rung or Enlightenment. To\nreiterate, reaction is not Burkean conservatism, however. De Maistre\n(1753\u20131821) was a reactionary critic of reason, intellectuals\nand universal rights. Burke attacked the revolutionaries of 1789\n\u201cfor the sake of traditional liberties, [Maistre] for the sake\nof traditional authority\u201d (Viereck 2009: 191). De Maistre\npraised Russian political culture as a spontaneous growth; in\ncontrast, that of Western Europe had been \u201cscribbled over\u201d\nby Enlightenment philosophers (see Gray 1998: 122).\n\nIn an alternative tradition to Burkean conservatism, Continental\nconservatives have subscribed to Thomist or Hegelian traditions,\nproducing a rational or systematic conservatism\u2014which might\ninclude reactionary forms. Commentators differ on the extent to which\n\u201crational conservatism\u201d challenges the centrality of\nBurkean conservatism to conservative tradition. John Gray argues\nthat\n\n\nConservatives have sometimes disdained theoretical reflection on\npolitical life, implying that political knowledge is\u2026best left\ninarticulate, uncorrupted by rationalist systematising. The\n[19th and 20th] centuries are nevertheless\nreplete with conservative thought\u2026as systematic and reflective\nas any found in the liberal tradition. (Gray 1995: 78\u20139) \n\n\nAs well as Burke, Gray cites Hegel, de Maistre, Savigny, Santayana and\nOakeshott, conservatives in that they share a \u201cspirit of\nreaction against the excesses of liberal rationalism\u201d (Gray\n1995: Ch. 10). Skorupski (2015) contrasts anti-universalist pragmatic\nconservatism with universalist rational conservatism; \u201crational\nconservatism\u201d does not exhibit particularist scepticism.\nRational conservatives maintain that a community with a hierarchy of\nauthority is most conducive to human well-being\u2014though they also\nregard agent-relative virtues such as loyalty and patriotism as\nfundamental, holding that it is universally true that patriotism is a\nvirtue. This is clearly the standpoint of authority rather than the\nstandpoint of freedom\n (see 1.5).\n\nHegel (1770\u20131831) is a key figure in the understanding of\nrational conservatism. Surprisingly for a standpoint that stresses the\nvalue of experience, conservatism\u2014Hume excepted\u2014has been\nassociated more with Idealism than with empiricism; philosophical\nempiricists have commonly been radicals. Hegel has been claimed by\nconservatives, but his political affiliation has been disputed since\nhis earliest disciples. For Left Hegelians including Marx,\nHegel\u2019s concept of free thought was a defence of Enlightenment\nrationality, and a critique of traditional political authority. For\nthem, Geist did not invoke a transcendent power, as some Right\nHegelians maintained, but was an anthropological and historical\nprocess of emancipation, propelled by contradiction and struggle. In\nthe 20th century, Hegel was regarded alternatively as a\nproto-totalitarian reactionary, a conservative, or a liberal. But the\n\u201cold orthodoxy\u201d that he is a conservative or\nreactionary\u2014in Anglophone philosophy largely derived from\nPopper\u2014has disappeared, and he is often seen as synthesising\nconservatism and liberalism (Fine 2001: 5). \n\nHegel was ambivalent towards the French Revolution, the\nworld-historical event against which his generation thought out their\npolitical philosophy and stance towards the Enlightenment (Taylor\n1977: 403). The German Constitution was critical, lamenting\nwith Burke the \u201cblind clamour for freedom\u201d and radical\negalitarianism (Hegel PW: 93); the abstract, Rousseauean notion of\nfreedom, attempting to construct society on the basis of\n\u201csubjective reason\u201d, caused a \u201cfury of\ndestruction\u201d. The \u201cPreface\u201d of Elements of the\nPhilosophy of Right (1821) is a Burkean attack on those who\nsuppose\n\n\nthat no state or constitution had ever previously existed\u2026that\nwe had now\u2026to start right from the beginning. (Hegel 1821: 12)\n\n\n\nThe Revolution\n\n\n\u2026afforded the tremendous spectacle, for the first time we know\nof in human history, of the overthrow of all\nexisting\u2026conditions within an actual major state and the\nrevision of its constitution from first principles\u2026[on] what\nwas supposed to be a purely rational basis\u2026the most terrible\nand drastic event (Hegel 1821: \u00a7258R)\n\n\nAccording to Hegel, Rousseau\u2019s contractual account destroys the\n\u201cdivine\u201d element of the state (ibid.).\n\nHowever, Hegel also has a Rousseauean side, that is clear in the\nPhilosophy of History, where the Revolution signals the dawn\nof freedom:\n\n\nA constitution\u2026was established in harmony with the thought of\nright\u2026Never since the sun had stood in the firmament and the\nplanets revolved around it had it been perceived that man\u2019s\nexistence centres in his head, i.e., in thought, inspired by which he\nbuilds up the world of reality. (Hegel 1822\u20131830: 447)\n\n\nRousseau\n\n\nput forward the will as the principle of the state, a principle which\nhas thought not only as its form [but also] its content, and which is\nin fact thinking itself. (Hegel 1821, \u00a7258R)\n\n\nSome writers thus claim Hegel for liberalism rather than conservatism,\nregarding his philosophy as\n\n\nthe most profound and compelling application of the [positive] idea of\nfreedom as\u2026autonomy to the realm of politics. (Franco 1999: 3)\n\n\n\nThe contemporary consensus sees Hegel as attempting to synthesise\nliberalism and conservatism. For Cristi, his rapprochement is not an\neclectic blend of liberal and conservative strands of thought, but a\nsystematic synthesis:\n\n\nThe dialectical method brings about [their] reconciliation\u2026by\nallowing an institutional embodiment for Hegel\u2019s commitment to\nfree subjectivity. (Cristi 1989: 719\u201320, 725)\n\n\nWhile Hegel does not appeal to non-human natural law or providential\norder, he attempts to reconcile human reason with historical laws and\ninstitutions:\n\n\nFor Hegel, unlike Burke, the political order must ultimately be\njustified to human reason, although not in the individualistic manner\nthat typifies Enlightenment rationalism. (Franco 1999: 127)\n\n\n(Though to reiterate, Burke\u2019s position here is contested.) The\nIdea of the state unites its divine character with the Rousseauean\nview that it is the product of human will and rationality (Franco\n1999: 288). \n\nHegel thus synthesises the universal and the particular:\n\n\nThe essence of the modern state is that the universal should be linked\nwith the complete freedom of particularity and the well-being of\nindividuals\u2026the personal knowledge and volition of the\nparticular individuals who must retain their rights\u2026Only when\nboth moments are present in full measure can the state be regarded\nas\u2026truly organised. (Hegel 1821: \u00a7260)\n\n\nHegel (1821) argues that in morality and politics, we judge for\nourselves, but not by ourselves. We come to recognise rational norms\nhistorically, as actualised; we always reason in terms of the norms of\nour society, which we must nonetheless endorse only reflectively.\n\nContemporary Left Hegelians treat Hegel\u2019s doctrine that reason\nis active in history as the claim that free thought, through the\nthinking of individuals, is history\u2019s internal cause.\nConservatives, in contrast, attacked Hegel\u2019s conception of\nevolving reason, for undermining the political order (Moggach 2013).\nBut for Skorupski, Hegel holds that free thought or natural reason\nmust be mediated by entrenched institutions of intellectual and\nspiritual authority: for Aquinas, the Church, for Hegel, a tradition\nof communal ethical life. Hegel affirms that \u201cthe right of the\nsubjective will\u201d, the freedom of the moral subject, is inherent\nin modern ethical life, thus grounding reason in free thought, but\nonly in the context of a conservative holism (Skorupski 2015). The key\nconcept here is Sittlichkeit (\u201cthe ethical\u201d or\n\u201cethical life\u201d). \n\nSittlichkeit is the third element in Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nof right, after abstract right and morality, and mediates its liberal\nand conservative polarities:\n\n\nThe right and the moral must have the ethical as their support and\nfoundation, for the right lacks\u2026subjectivity, while morality in\nturn possesses this [alone]. (PR \u00a7141A)\n\n\nWhile \u201cmorality\u201d is subjective self-determination,\nSittlichkeit or \u201cethical life\u201d is both an\nattitude of individuals and a collective way of life, a set of values\nand practices or institutions. Its content is not derivable from a\nhigher principle; it is externally a culture\u2019s values and\ninstitutions, and internally an aspect of one\u2019s identity. Hegel\naccepts that an ethical life is historically contingent, even\narbitrary, in content, yet insists on its essential role in every\nsociety, and its need to develop organically. For him, some kinds of\nSittlichkeit are more advanced than others; at any one time,\na more advanced society drives world history forward by realising it\nin its institutions, customs, culture new ideas. This position goes\nbeyond the minimal rationality and universality of conservatism, which\nmakes no reference to historical advance.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge is the thinker chiefly responsible for\nintroducing German Idealism to English-speaking readers, though in the\nperson of Kant rather than Hegel. As Townshend comments, \u201cit is\nquite normal [to] write the history of English\nconservatism\u2026without reference to Coleridge\u201d (1993: 32),\nperhaps because the conservative appeal to experience is wrongly taken\nto be empiricist. Coleridge was an ardent enthusiast for the French\nRevolution who, disillusioned with its excesses, came to share\nBurke\u2019s \u201cconservative constitutionalism\u201d. He\ndeclared that\n\n\nthe consequences of the heroic medicines recommended by the\nRevolutionists [are] far more dreadful than the disease. (Coleridge\n1812: 154)\n\n\nHowever, revolutionary ideals often appeal to \u201cnoble and\nimaginative spirits\u201d; one must offer superior ideals, and\nsubstantial reforms. Coleridge criticised Burke\u2019s \u201cabsurd\nopposition of Theory to Practice\u201d, since \u201cthe meanest of\nmen has his Theory: and to think at all is to theorise\u201d.\nColeridge warned against unchecked industrialisation, and criticised\nthe unfettered free-market, influencing Disraeli\u2019s\nsocial-welfare conservatism.\n\nColeridge argued for a national Church exercising spiritual, moral and\ncultural leadership, maintaining schools in conjunction with the\nstate. In a Burkean image, he writes that a \u201cclerisy\u201d of\ninstructors\u2014a disinterested class restraining against the\nself-interest of the others\u2014would\n\n\nguard the treasures, of past civilisation, and\u2026bind the present\nwith the past; to\u2026add to the same, and thus to connect the\npresent with the future. (CW [1809]: 189)\n\n\nOn the Constitution of the Church and State (1830) traced the\nunderlying idea of the English state back to King Alfred. Coleridge\nasked whether institutions were \u201cfounded either in the nature of\nthings or in the necessities of our nature\u201d; ideals \u201ccan\nbe profitably studied only as they are reflected in the particular\ninstitutions of a living political organism\u201d (Coleridge 1829:\n276). J.S. Mill ranked Coleridge\u2019s influence on political\nthought as equal to Bentham\u2019s, calling them \u201cthe two great\nseminal minds of England in their age\u201d. Bentham wished to reform\nor replace venerable institutions which lacked utility, while\nColeridge\u2019s work was a necessary counterweight to Benthamite\nutilitarian liberalism, as\n\n\na Tory philosopher [rescues] truths which Tories have forgotten, and\nwhich the prevailing schools of Liberalism never knew. (Mill, CW X:\n163, \u201cColeridge\u201d\u2014note the early use of\n\u201cLiberalism\u201d (1840))\n\n\nTo reiterate, it was to Burke, with his scepticism about reason, that\nconstructors of an ideology of English conservatism appealed in the\nlate nineteenth century; Coleridge\u2019s philosophical prestige was\nwaning, and his radical associations did not appeal to conservatives.\nTories did not appreciate the larger role for progression in\nColeridge\u2019s thought, which is more rationalist than sceptically\npragmatic; his affinities with German Idealism, whose incursions into\nEnglish-speaking philosophy have been intermittent, were too\nstrong.\n\nThe work of major Victorian thinker and writer Thomas Carlyle\n(1795\u20131881) bears a complex relationship with conservatism; in\nhis later career he was a reactionary. Carlyle was a prophet of his\ntime who rejected industrialisation, and questioned progress; in these\nrespects he was a precursor of the equally influential Victorian\nthinker, John Ruskin. But Carlyle was an authoritarian radical, closer\nto Nietzsche\u2019s aristocratic radicalism or elitism; his position was\ntherefore removed both from Burkean conservatism, and rationalist\nconservatism. He insisted on the importance of leadership, and is\nperhaps best known for his \u201cgreat man\u201d theory of history.\nHe supported the South in the American Civil War, and objected to\neconomics as \u201cthe dismal science\u201d because of its failure\nto justify slavery.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli (1804\u201381), founder of the essentially Burkean\n\u201cOne Nation\u201d conservatism, was a politician first, writer\nand thinker second. Disraeli never actually used the phrase \u201cOne\nNation\u201d, but it was implied. The term comes from his 1845\nnovel Sybil; or the two nations, where Walter Gerard, a\nworking-class radical, describes \u201cTwo nations; between whom\nthere is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each\nother\u2019s habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in\ndifferent zones, or inhabitants of different planets\u2026The RICH\nand the POOR\u201d. His aim was to unite these two nations through\nthe benevolent leadership of the Conservative Party; he thus offered a\nmilder version of Bismarckian conservatism. As Chancellor of the\nExchequer and conservative leader in the House of Commons, he guided\nthe 1867 Reform Act, and as Prime Minister (1874-80), enacted social\nreform, passing laws on public health, factory acts, and laws on trade\nunion recognition. In these respects, he helped establish \u201cOne\nNation\u201d conservatism.\n\nJames Fitzjames Stephen (1829\u201394) author of Liberty,\nEquality, Fraternity (1873), is best-known as Mill\u2019s most\nscathing critic. Despite Carlyle\u2019s influence on him, he was not a\nradical, but rather a classical liberal; Julia Stapleton describes his\nideas as having an affinity with Burke\u2019s, in their defence of\ntraditional institutions against Radical attack (Stapleton, 1998).\nHowever, his Liberty, Equality, Fraternity (1873) is\nindebted to Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan, whose authoritarianism\nhas little true conservative content (Townshend 1993). He had more\nveneration for established institutions than did Mill and his\nfollowers, and regarded moral life as relatively static. His\nobjections to Mill were paternalist, and like conservatives, he was a\npessimist concerning human nature.\n",
