    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Practical Wisdom\n1.2 Practical Wisdom\n\nAnother way in which one can easily fall short of full virtue is\nthrough lacking phronesis\u2014moral or practical\nwisdom.\n\nThe concept of a virtue is the concept of something that makes its\npossessor good: a virtuous person is a morally good, excellent or\nadmirable person who acts and feels as she should. These are commonly\naccepted truisms. But it is equally common, in relation to particular\n(putative) examples of virtues to give these truisms up. We may say of\nsomeone that he is generous or honest \u201cto a fault\u201d. It is\ncommonly asserted that someone\u2019s compassion might lead them to\nact wrongly, to tell a lie they should not have told, for example, in\ntheir desire to prevent someone else\u2019s hurt feelings. It is also\nsaid that courage, in a desperado, enables him to do far more wicked\nthings than he would have been able to do if he were timid. So it\nwould appear that generosity, honesty, compassion and courage despite\nbeing virtues, are sometimes faults. Someone who is generous, honest,\ncompassionate, and courageous might not be a morally good\nperson\u2014or, if it is still held to be a truism that they are,\nthen morally good people may be led by what makes them morally good to\nact wrongly! How have we arrived at such an odd conclusion?\n\nThe answer lies in too ready an acceptance of ordinary usage, which\npermits a fairly wide-ranging application of many of the virtue terms,\ncombined, perhaps, with a modern readiness to suppose that the\nvirtuous agent is motivated by emotion or inclination, not by rational\nchoice. If one thinks of generosity or honesty as the\ndisposition to be moved to action by generous or honest impulses such\nas the desire to give or to speak the truth, if one thinks of\ncompassion as the disposition to be moved by the sufferings of others\nand to act on that emotion, if one thinks of courage as mere\nfearlessness or the willingness to face danger, then it will indeed\nseem obvious that these are all dispositions that can lead to their\npossessor\u2019s acting wrongly. But it is also obvious, as soon as\nit is stated, that these are dispositions that can be possessed by\nchildren, and although children thus endowed (bar the\n\u201ccourageous\u201d disposition) would undoubtedly be very nice\nchildren, we would not say that they were morally virtuous or\nadmirable people. The ordinary usage, or the reliance on motivation by\ninclination, gives us what Aristotle calls \u201cnatural\nvirtue\u201d\u2014a proto version of full virtue awaiting perfection\nby phronesis or practical wisdom.\n\nAristotle makes a number of specific remarks about phronesis\nthat are the subject of much scholarly debate, but the (related)\nmodern concept is best understood by thinking of what the virtuous\nmorally mature adult has that nice children, including nice\nadolescents, lack. Both the virtuous adult and the nice child have\ngood intentions, but the child is much more prone to mess things up\nbecause he is ignorant of what he needs to know in order to do what he\nintends. A virtuous adult is not, of course, infallible and may also,\non occasion, fail to do what she intended to do through lack of\nknowledge, but only on those occasions on which the lack of knowledge\nis not culpable. So, for example, children and adolescents often harm\nthose they intend to benefit either because they do not know how to\nset about securing the benefit or because their understanding of what\nis beneficial and harmful is limited and often mistaken. Such\nignorance in small children is rarely, if ever culpable. Adults, on\nthe other hand, are culpable if they mess things up by being\nthoughtless, insensitive, reckless, impulsive, shortsighted, and by\nassuming that what suits them will suit everyone instead of taking a\nmore objective viewpoint. They are also culpable if their\nunderstanding of what is beneficial and harmful is mistaken. It is\npart of practical wisdom to know how to secure real benefits\neffectively; those who have practical wisdom will not make the mistake\nof concealing the hurtful truth from the person who really needs to\nknow it in the belief that they are benefiting him.\n\nQuite generally, given that good intentions are intentions to act well\nor \u201cdo the right thing\u201d, we may say that practical wisdom\nis the knowledge or understanding that enables its possessor, unlike\nthe nice adolescents, to do just that, in any given situation. The\ndetailed specification of what is involved in such knowledge or\nunderstanding has not yet appeared in the literature, but some aspects\nof it are becoming well known. Even many deontologists now stress the\npoint that their action-guiding rules cannot, reliably, be applied\nwithout practical wisdom, because correct application requires\nsituational appreciation\u2014the capacity to recognise, in any\nparticular situation, those features of it that are morally salient.\nThis brings out two aspects of practical wisdom.\n\nOne is that it characteristically comes only with experience of life.\nAmongst the morally relevant features of a situation may be the likely\nconsequences, for the people involved, of a certain action, and this\nis something that adolescents are notoriously clueless about precisely\nbecause they are inexperienced. It is part of practical wisdom to be\nwise about human beings and human life. (It should go without saying\nthat the virtuous are mindful of the consequences of possible actions.\nHow could they fail to be reckless, thoughtless and short-sighted if\nthey were not?)\n\nThe second is the practically wise agent\u2019s capacity to recognise\nsome features of a situation as more important than others, or indeed,\nin that situation, as the only relevant ones. The wise do not see\nthings in the same way as the nice adolescents who, with their\nunder-developed virtues, still tend to see the personally\ndisadvantageous nature of a certain action as competing in importance\nwith its honesty or benevolence or justice.\n\nThese aspects coalesce in the description of the practically wise as\nthose who understand what is truly worthwhile, truly important, and\nthereby truly advantageous in life, who know, in short, how to live\nwell.\n",
