    "main_text": "Moral Seeing as a Spiritual Achievement vs. the Unreflective Good, Non-Egoistic Person\n13. Moral Seeing as a Spiritual Achievement vs. the Unreflective Good, Non-Egoistic Person\n\nMurdoch generally presents seeing moral reality as a difficult and\nlengthy mental, emotional, and spiritual achievement, never able to be\nfully accomplished. The defeat or transcendence of the ego is\nsomething the agent must continually work at. This idea of a spiritual\njourney toward moral seeing looms even larger in Metaphysics.\nHowever, Murdoch also wants to leave room for rare persons for whom\nappreciating the Good and the reality of other people is not achieved\nprimarily through struggle and challenge. As she says in a oft-quoted\npassage, \u201c[I]t must be possible to do justice to both Socrates\nand the virtuous peasant\u201d (IP: 2/300). (The latter is not an\nauspicious formulation, as \u201cpeasants\u201d, even if uneducated,\ncan still be reflective and intentional in seeking the Good.) Murdoch\nfollows Schopenhauer, an important historical figure for her, in\nmarveling at meeting that rare someone in whom \u201cthe anxious\navaricious tentacles of the self\u201d, so ubiquitous in human nature,\nare absent [SGC: 103/385]. Of course, this is not to deny that any\nvirtuous person must sometimes have to suppress anti-moral desire, or\nto struggle to see other persons in their full reality. Even if the\ndifference is one of degree, the \u201cconstant struggle\u201d image\nis quite different from the virtuous peasant, and Murdoch wants to\nleave room for both.\n",
