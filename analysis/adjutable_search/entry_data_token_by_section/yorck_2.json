Philosophical Fragments on History and Psychology\n\nMore than half a century after his death, three philosophical\nfragments by Yorck\u2014originally written in the last six years of\nhis life\u2014were published between 1956 and 1970 (see the\n Bibliography).\n The most important is entitled Bewusstseinsstellung und\nGeschichte [\u201cStances of Consciousness and History\u201d]\n(abbreviated hereafter as ST). It addresses the sources and the\ndevelopment of human history, providing the philosophical underpinning\nand more detailed exploration of views that Yorck had mentioned in his\nCorrespondence with Dilthey. The following section presents\nthe major points of this systematic fragment.\n\nYorck\u2019s main aim is to provide an analysis of the underlying\npsychology of human life, which he considers the basis for all\nhistorical development. According to Yorck, particular configurations\nin the psychology of man, or stances of consciousness, determine the\ndominant shape of historical epochs. In other words, certain positions\nadopted on the level of \u201cprimary life\u201d [prim\u00e4re\nLebendigkeit], the stances taken by consciousness within life,\ndetermine \u201chistorical life\u201d [historische\nLebendigkeit] at large and can define entire epochs (ST, p. 5;\nalso pp. 52, 53). Therefore, Yorck speaks of the \u201cpsychology of\nhistory\u201d and, the \u201cphilosophic history of\nphilosophy\u201d (which traces the stances of consciousness through\nempirical history) (ST, p. 10).\n\nAll this is predicated on the supposition of our intuitive access to\npsychological or primary life through \u201cself-reflection\u201d\n[Selbstbesinnung]. Yorck interprets Dilthey\u2019s insight\nthat one cannot go beyond life to mean that one cannot surpass or\ntranscend \u201cthe empirical givenness of self-consciousness,\u201d\nwhich entails that philosophy is \u201cempirical,\u201d not\nspeculative (ST, pp. 8, 3). Evidence can only be found in\nself-consciousness. What does not pass the test in one\u2019s own\nlife cannot count as a valid expression of life: The seat of all\nnecessary truth is \u201cself-experimentation\u201d (ST, 9, also\n 54).[9]\n\nNot unlike Husserl, Yorck pursues, albeit without an elaborate set of\nmethodological rules, a \u201cre-duction\u201d of all objectivity to\nself-consciousness, where self-consciousness is a living and\nhistorical structure that cannot be restricted to knowing or any other\nparticular function of life. As Gadamer (1990, pp. 246\u2013269) has\npointed out, despite his critique of transcendental philosophy, Yorck\nmay be read as actually expanding the transcendental focus, which\ntraditionally used to be on knowing, so as to include the entire gamut\nof human experiences and their necessary conditions in human\nlife. Following Dilthey, Yorck sees human consciousness as a\nliving structure where the emphasis lies on its\n\u201caliveness,\u201d Lebendigkeit, which includes not\nonly outward-directed intentionality towards objectivity\n(representation and volition), but also self-awareness, and\nself-feeling of inner life. Close to Schleiermacher, Yorck even\nspecifies that \u201cthe ultimate datum\u201d in self-consciousness\nis \u201cthe feeling of life\u201d [Lebensgef\u00fchl]\nitself (ST, p. 11).\n",
