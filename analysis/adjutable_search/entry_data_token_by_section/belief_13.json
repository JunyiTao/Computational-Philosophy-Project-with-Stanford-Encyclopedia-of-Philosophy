    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || Fine- or Coarse-Grained?\n3.1 Fine- or Coarse-Grained?\n\nThe standard view that the contents of beliefs are propositions gives\nrise to a debate about belief contents parallel to, and closely\nrelated to, a debate about the metaphysics of propositions. One\nstandard view of propositions takes propositions to be sets of\npossible worlds; another takes propositions to have something more\nclosely resembling a linguistic logical structure (see\n structured propositions\n for a detailed exposition of this issue).\n\nStalnaker (1984) endorses the possible-worlds view of propositions and\nimports it directly into his discussion of belief content: He contends\nthe content of a belief is specified by the set of \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d at which that belief is true (see Lewis 1979 for a\nsimilar approach). The structure of belief content is thus the\nstructure of set theory. Among the advantages Stalnaker claims for\nthis view is its smooth accommodation of gradual change and of what\nmight, from the point of view of a discrete linguistic structure, be\nseen as problematically indeterminate belief contents. Developing an\nexample from Dennett (1969), he describes the gradual transition from\na child\u2019s learning to say (without really understanding) that\n\u201cDaddy is a doctor\u201d to having a full, adult appreciation\nof the fact that their father is a doctor. At some point, Stalnaker\nsuggests, it\u2019s best to say that child \u201csort of\u201d or\n\u201chalf\u201d believes the proposition in question. It\u2019s\nnot clear how to characterize such gradual shifts by means of a\nlinguistic or quasi-linguistic propositional structure (1984, p.\n64\u201365; see also Schwitzgebel 2001). On Stalnaker\u2019s view,\nthe child\u2019s half-belief is handled by attributing the child the\ncapacity to rule out some but not all of the possibilities\nincompatible with Daddy\u2019s being a doctor: As their knowledge\ngrows, so does their sense of the excluded possibilities.\n\nThe possible worlds approach to belief content is sometimes referred\nto as a \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d approach because it implies that\nany two beliefs that would be true in exactly the same set of possible\nworlds have the same content\u2014as opposed to a\n\u201cfine-grained\u201d approach on which beliefs that would be\ntrue at exactly the same set of possible worlds may nonetheless differ\nin content. The difference between these two approaches is brought out\nmost starkly by considering mathematical propositions. On standard\naccounts of possibility, all mathematically true propositions are true\nin exactly the same set of possible worlds\u2014every world.\nIt seems to follow, on the coarse-grained view, that the belief that 1\n+ 1 = 2 has exactly the same content as the belief that the cosine of\n0 is 1, and thus that anyone who believes (or fails to believe) the\none accordingly believes (or fails to believe) the other. And that\nseems absurd.\n\nStalnaker attempts to escape this difficulty by characterizing\nmathematical belief as belief about sentences: The belief\nthat the sentence \u201c1 + 1 = 2\u201d expresses a truth\nand the belief that the sentence \u201cthe cosine of 0 is\n1\u201d expresses a truth have different content and may differ in\ntruth value between possible worlds (due simply to possible variations\nin the meanings of terms, if nothing else). However, it\u2019s\nprobably fair to say that few philosophers follow Stalnaker in this\nview (see discussion in Robbins 2004; and Rayo 2013 for a recent view\nsimilar to Stalnaker\u2019s). The apparent difficulty of sustaining\nsuch a view of belief is often held to reflect badly on the a\ncoarse-grained possible-worlds view of propositions in general, since\nit\u2019s generally thought that one of the principal metaphysical\nfunctions of propositions is to serve as the contents of belief and\nother \u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d (e.g., Field 1978; Soames\n1987).\n",
