    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Neural Theories\n9.7 Neural Theories \nNeural theories of consciousness come in many forms, though most in\nsome way concern the so called \u201cneural correlates of\nconsciousness\u201d or NCCs. Unless one is a dualist or other\nnon-physicalist, more than mere correlation is required; at least some\nNCCs must be the essential substrates of consciousness. An explanatory\nneural theory needs to explain why or how the relevant correlations\nexist, and if the theory is committed to physicalism that will require\nshowing how the underlying neural substrates could be identical with\ntheir neural correlates or at least realize them by satisfying the\nrequired roles or conditions (Metzinger 2000).\n\n\nSuch theories are diverse not only in the neural processes or\nproperties to which they appeal but also in the aspects of\nconsciousness they take as their respective explananda. Some are based\non high-level systemic features of the brain, but others focus on more\nspecific physiological or structural properties, with corresponding\ndifferences in their intended explanatory targets.  Most in some way\naim to connect with theories of consciousness at other levels of\ndescription such as cognitive, representational or higher-order\ntheories.\n\n\nA sampling of recent neural theories might include models that\nappeal to global integrated fields (Kinsbourne), binding through\nsynchronous oscillation (Singer 1999, Crick and Koch 1990),\nNMDA-mediated transient neural assemblies (Flohr 1995), thalamically\nmodulated patterns of cortical activation (Llinas 2001), reentrant\ncortical loops (Edelman 1989), comparator mechanisms that engage in\ncontinuous action-prediction-assessment loops between frontal and\nmidbrain areas (Gray 1995), left hemisphere based interpretative\nprocesses (Gazzaniga 1988), and emotive somatosensory hemostatic\nprocesses based in the frontal-limbic nexus (Damasio 1999) or in the\nperiaqueductal gray (Panksepp 1998).\n\n\nIn each case the aim is to explain how organization and activity at\nthe relevant neural level could underlie one or another major type or\nfeature of consciousness. Global fields or transient synchronous\nassemblies could underlie the intentional unity of phenomenal\nconsciousness. NMDA-based plasticity, specific thalamic projections\ninto the cortex, or regular oscillatory waves could all contribute to\nthe formation of short term but widespread neural patterns or\nregularities needed to knit integrated conscious experience out of the\nlocal activity in diverse specialized brain modules. Left hemisphere\ninterpretative processes could provide a basis for narrative forms of\nconscious self-awareness. Thus it is possible for multiple distinct\nneural theories to all be true, with each contributing some partial\nunderstanding of the links between conscious mentality in its diverse\nforms and the active brain at its many levels of complex organization\nand structure.\n\nOne particular recent controversy has concerned the issue of whether\nglobal or merely local recurrent activity is sufficient for phenomenal\nconsciousness.  Supporters of the global neuronal workspace model\n(Dehaene 2000) have argued that consciousness of any sort can occur\nonly when contents are activated with a large scale pattern of\nrecurrent activity involving frontal and parietal areas as well as\nprimary sensory areas of cortex.  Others in particular the\npsychologist Victor Lamme (2006) and the philosopher Ned Block (2007)\nhave argued that local recurrent activity between higher and lower\nareas within sensory cortex (e.g. with visual cortex) can suffice for\nphenomenal consciousness even in the absence of verbal reportability\nand other indicators of access consciousness. \n",
