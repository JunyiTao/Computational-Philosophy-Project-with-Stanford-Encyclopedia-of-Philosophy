    "main_text": "Kinds of Freedoms\n2. Kinds of Freedoms\n\nSection 1\n above focuses on the nature and value of different kinds of\nassociations, within the home, at work, in the marketplace, at places\nof worship, and in the pub or club. It does not distinguish\nassociating from the freedoms to associate and\ndissociate. Here,\n \u00a72\n explores the nature of our associative freedoms, while\n \u00a73,\n \u00a74, and\n \u00a75\n explore these freedoms\u2019 forms, force, and value, as well as\ntheir various limitations.\n\nProminent liberal philosophers such as John Stuart Mill defend a broad\nnotion of freedom of association. Freedom of association is,\nfor Mill, one of the core domains of individual freedom. Mill says\nthat we have the freedom, in combination with other people, \u201cto\nunite for any purpose not involving harm to others: the persons\ncombining being supposed to be of full age and not forced or\ndeceived\u201d. He also says that we have \u201c\u2026the right to\nchoose the society most acceptable to us\u201d, free from government\ninterference (Mill 1859: ch. IV). The other core freedoms he\nidentifies are (1) freedom of thought, conscience, opinion and\nfeeling, that is to say, complete control over our own inner domain of\nconsciousness; (2) freedom of expression in speech and writing; and\n(3) freedom to shape our own lives according to our tastes and\npursuits in line with our character and inclinations; he embraced the\nidea that we engage in different \u201cexperiments in living\u201d.\nUnlike freedom of thought and opinion which are largely immune to\nMill\u2019s \u201cvery simple principle\u201d which we now know as\nthe harm principle, freedom of association is subject to this\nharm principle that we are permitted to interfere with someone\u2019s\nconduct only to prevent harm to others.\n\nMill\u2019s strong endorsement of associative freedom leaves many\nquestions unanswered since it pertains only to consenting adults\nacting with full information. As\n \u00a71\n makes clear, many of our core associations have a different\nstructure, as we could not consent to them. Especially in early\nchildhood, we do not choose, though we often come to embrace, our\nfamilial arrangements. Also, many of our closest, familial\nassociations can produce some often-unintended harm to others, since\nthese associations are necessarily exclusive and, hence, disregard\nnon-members\u2019 associative needs. Moreover, Mill\u2019s\nendorsement of free association among consenting adults may be too\nstrong. Not all mutually consensual associations can be protected by\nfreedom of association. Some consensual\nassociations\u2014such as a violently abusive marriage which neither\nspouse wishes to leave\u2014do not automatically fall under the gaze\nof Mill\u2019s harm principle, since his principle makes space for\naction that does affect other people with their free, voluntary, and\nundeceived consent and participation (Mill 1859: ch. I). But, such\nconnections are too morally opprobrious to merit protection from\nthird-party interference.\n\nMany contemporary moral and political philosophers analyze our\nindividual rights and freedoms with a conceptual apparatus developed\nby Wesley Hohfeld (1919), who identified eight normative positions\nwhich together make four pairs of correlates and four pairs of\nopposites. Claims correlate with duties.\nLiberties (or permissions), which are the opposite\nof duties, correlate with no-claims. Powers\ncorrelate with liabilities. And, disabilities, the\nopposite of powers, correlate with immunities, which are the\nopposite of liabilities. Using this Hohfeldian terminology,\nfreedom of association can refer to any one of the following\npositions and its correlate:\n\nPermission: We might be at liberty, i.e., have a moral or\nlegal permission, to associate or dissociate with other people. When\nwe have a permission to associate with, or dissociate from, someone,\nwe have no duty not to act, and, hence, correlatively, other people\nhave no claim upon us that we act otherwise. Moral and legal\npermissions do not always go hand in hand. An adult might have a legal\npermission to marry a child, but he has no moral permission to do\nso.\nClaim-right: We might have a moral or legal claim-right\nagainst others interfering with our conduct, which issues in a\nprotected sphere of action to associate with, or dissociate from,\npeople in certain ways even if we commit moral wrongs by doing so.\nWhen we have such a claim, others have a duty not to interfere, and\nmay have a duty positively to protect our sphere of action.\nPower: We might have a moral or legal power to alter our\nassociative status in relation to other people. The power to join an\nassociation can produce new rights and duties, or remove previously\nvalid rights and duties. When we marry someone, we exercise a power to\nalter both their normative status and our own by creating new claims,\nrights, duties, and powers. As parents, we have the power to decide\nwhether our children will be friends with other kids. If we divorce,\nwe exercise a power to alter our children\u2019s associative position\nin relation to us and possibly each other. When we have such powers to\naffect others\u2019 normative associative position, they have a\nliability to be affected by how we use our power.\nImmunity: We might have a moral or legal immunity against\nother people exercising their rights to association or dissociation in\nways that would alter our associative status. When we are immune,\nother people are disabled from exercising a power over us (Brownlee\n2015: 271; 2016a: 362). For instance, once we mature, our parents no\nlonger have the power to decide whether we\u2019ll associate with\ncertain people or not.\n\n\nThis Hohfeldian apparatus can be used to assess the specific rights\nthat comprise our freedom of association. These specific rights can be\nparsed as the right to exit, the right to exclude, and the right to\norganizational autonomy. Since our permissions, claim-rights, powers\nand immunities shift depending on the type of association under\ndiscussion, these rights will be discussed in connection with the\ndifferent associational types outlined in\n \u00a71.\n\nImportantly, these three rights\u2014to exclude, to exit, and to\nexercise organizational autonomy\u2014do not include a positive right\nto associate. These three rights all presuppose, however, that we\nalready belong to at least one association, since these rights can\nonly be exercised from within associations. If someone is\nexcluded from all associations, then the above framework does little\nto guarantee her any of the goods of associational life. The rights of\nassociation are important because they allow us some degree of control\nover how our lives go. However, precisely because the focus of these\nrights is our interpersonal relations, they can have the consequence\nof comprehensively excluding some people. There is, thus, an important\ntension between freedom of association and other possible goods of\nassociation. In getting to grips with this tension, it is necessary to\nassess the impact of employing the rights to exclude, exit, and\nexercise organizational autonomy across the different associational\nforms outlined above.\n\nSections\n \u00a73,\n \u00a74, and\n \u00a75\n consider, respectively, the content of the rights to exclude, exit,\nand exercise organizational autonomy, followed by considerations of\npossible limits to these rights which are necessary to protect or\nadvance other values.\n",
