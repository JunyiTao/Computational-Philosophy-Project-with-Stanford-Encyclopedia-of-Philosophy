    "main_text": "\nAn axiomatic theory of truth is a deductive theory of truth as a\nprimitive undefined predicate. Because of the liar and other\nparadoxes, the axioms and rules have to be chosen carefully in order\nto avoid inconsistency. Many axiom systems for the truth predicate\nhave been discussed in the literature and their respective properties\nbeen analysed. Several philosophers, including many deflationists, have endorsed axiomatic theories of truth in their\naccounts of truth. The logical properties of the formal theories are\nrelevant to various philosophical questions, such as questions about\nthe ontological status of properties, G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems,\ntruth-theoretic deflationism, eliminability of semantic notions and\nthe theory of meaning.\n",
