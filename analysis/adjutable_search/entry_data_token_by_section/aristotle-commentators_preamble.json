    "main_text": "\n\nOne important mode of philosophical expression from the end of the\nHellenistic period and into Late Antiquity was the philosophical\ncommentary. During this time Plato and Aristotle were regarded as\nphilosophical authorities and their works were subject to intense\nstudy. This entry offers a concise account of how the revival of\ninterest in the philosophy of Aristotle that took place toward the end\nof the Hellenistic period eventually developed into a new literary\nproduction: the philosophical commentary. It also follows the\ncommentary tradition into Late Antiquity in order to account for the\nvitality and richness of this tradition. Special emphasis is given to\nthe ancient study of the Categories because this short but\ndifficult treatise played a central role in the post-Hellenistic\nreturn to Aristotle. The reader should keep in mind that the study of\nAristotle in the form of the commentary did not mean the cessation of\ngenuine philosophical thought. Quite the contrary: philosophers\ncustomarily used the commentary format not only to expound the works\nof Aristotle, but also as a vehicle for original philosophical\ntheorizing. One consequence of this approach was that, at least at the\nbeginning, the return to Aristotle did not involve the acceptance of\nany definite set of doctrines. More directly (and more boldly): there\nwas no definite set of doctrines that a Peripatetic philosopher in the\n1st century BCE was expected to accept. At the time\nAristotle was considered an authority not because he was above\ncriticism, but because he deserved to be studied carefully.\n",
