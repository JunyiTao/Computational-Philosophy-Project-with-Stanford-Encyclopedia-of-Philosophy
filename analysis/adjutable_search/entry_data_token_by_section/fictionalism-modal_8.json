    "main_text": "Technical Problems || Hale\u2019s Dilemma\n3.2 Hale\u2019s Dilemma\n\nBob Hale (in Hale 1995b) posed a dilemma for modal fictionalism (more\nspecifically, Rosen\u2019s version of modal fictionalism, though\nother varieties face a similar dilemma). A modal fictionalist who\nmaintains the version outlined in Rosen 1990 believes that the fiction\nof possible worlds (PW) is not literally true. A question arises about\nthe modal status of the fiction: is it necessarily false, or\ncontingently false? In either case, Hale argues, the modal\nfictionalist is in trouble.\n\nShould modal fictionalists claim that the story of possible worlds is\nnecessarily false, then Hale argues that they cannot gloss their\n\u201caccording to the fiction of possible worlds \u2026.\u201d\nprefix as \u201cwere the fiction of possible worlds true, then\n\u2026 would be true\u201d. This is because, according to Hale,\nconditional claims with antecedents which are necessarily false are\nautomatically true, so if the fiction of possible worlds is taken to\nbe necessarily false, then all conditionals of the form \u201cwere\nthe fiction of possible worlds true then \u2026\u201d are true, and\nnot merely the ones that the modal fictionalist wishes to endorse. If\nthe modal fiction is to be useful, not everything should be true\naccording to it: examples of claims that had better not be true\naccording to it include the claim that 2+2=7, or the claim that there\nare no possible worlds.\n\nOn the other hand, if the fiction of possible worlds (PW) is only\ncontingently false, Hale claims this also lands the Rosen\u2019s\nfictionalism in trouble, since if its falsehood is only contingent,\nthen the fiction might have been literally true (or it is possible\nthat the fiction be true). But according to Hale the \u201cofficial\nfictionalist paraphrase\u201d of what this possibility would amount\nto \u201ccannot adequately capture the content of the claim that\npossibly PW is true\u201d. (p 65) Hale claims this is so because the\nclaim \u201cAccording to PW, there is a possible world at which PW is\ntrue\u201d is equivalent for Rosen\u2019s fictionalist to \u201cIf\nPW were true, there would be a world at which PW is true\u201d: and\nthis conditional is one which would be true whether or not PW was\ntrue.\n\nA modal fictionalist might try to resist either horn of the dilemma.\nOn the first horn, modal fictionalists might employ another gloss on\nwhat it is to be true according to PW, or they might endorse one of\nthe various theories of conditionals on which conditionals with\nnecessarily false antecedents are not automatically true. On the\nsecond horn, even fictionalists who accepted that they were committed\nto analysing their claim that PW could have been true as \u201cIf PW\nwere true, there would be a world at which PW is true\u201d could\ndispute Hale\u2019s claim that this is inadequate (see for example\nDivers 1999b, pp. 325\u2013326).\n\nA third option, explored by Rosen 1995, is not to take PW to be false,\nbut rather altogether lacking a truth-value \u2014 e.g., in virtue of\nemploying terms with no literal application, such as \u201c\u2026\nis a world-mate of\u2026\u201d. Hale\u2019s dilemma is directed\nprimarily against fictionalists who take the literal content of their\nfiction to be false, and those fictionalists prepared to ascribe some\nother status to their fictional claims avoid the dilemma as initially\nstated (though this route may encounter difficulties of its own,\nespecially if it retains some sort of conditional analysis of the\n\u201caccording to PW\u201d prefix).\n\nRosen 1995 and Divers 1999b are among the responses to Hale, and Hale\nhas in turn responded to Rosen 1995 in Hale 1995a, where Hale argues\nthat several of the responses suggested by Rosen in turn face serious\nproblems. Skiba 2019 points out some complications that arise from\naddressing this challenge in a way that does not compromise a\nDivers-style \u201csafety result\u201d of the sort discussed above,\nthough Skiba argues that modal fictionalists can handle these\ncomplications.\n",
