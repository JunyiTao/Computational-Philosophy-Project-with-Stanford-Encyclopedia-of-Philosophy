    "main_text": "\n\nEconomic discourse of the early modern period offers an analysis of\nspecific core phenomena: property, money, commerce, trade, public\nfinance, population growth, and economic development, as well as\ninvestigations into economic inequality and distributive justice. Many\nof the leading early modern philosophers, from Nicholas Copernicus to\nAdam Smith, made significant contributions to economics. This list\nincludes Jean Bodin, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley,\nMontesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, \u00c9tienne Bonnot\nde Condillac, and Jeremy Bentham. Other philosophers of renown\naddressed the principles of property and commercial obligations,\nnotably Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, Thomas Paine, Immanuel Kant,\nCondorcet, and Sophie de Grouchy. If economics is construed more\nbroadly as reflections on the moral dimensions of material betterment,\nthen the list much expands, to include, for example, Bernard\nMandeville, Frances Hutcheson, Voltaire, Thomas Reid, and Antonio\nGenovesi. If one expands the ambit of economics to include the complex\ninterplay between reason and the passions as directed at the pursuit\nof happiness, then countless men and women of letters in the early\nmodern period contributed to this discourse.\n\nThere were at least a dozen schools of economic thought in the early\nmodern period. Impressively, by the close of the eighteenth century,\nmany of the core principles and laws on money, markets, and trade had\nbeen articulated, and many of the methods of economics\u2014model\nbuilding, time series analysis, statistical estimation, game theory\nand decision theory\u2014were already extant. In sum, the\n\u201cscience of commerce\u201d as economics was mostly known at the\ntime, was a mature inquiry and, as held true of the natural sciences\nin the early modern period, drew substantially on its philosophical\nroots.\n",
