    "main_text": "Culture of a Renaissance Man: Economics, Sorcery, Naturalism || Bodin\u2019s theories on economics and finances\n5.1 Bodin\u2019s theories on economics and finances\nIn 1566, M. de Malestroict, master of accounts on the making of\nmoney, published his work, Paradoxes, to demonstrate that\ncontrary to popular opinion in France, real prices had not risen over\nthe past three centuries.  In other words, the value of money had\nremained proportional to the amount of gold and silver it\ncontained. For example, concerning inflation, Malestroict posited that\nalthough the price of land and property may have increased since the\nreign of St. Louis IX, inflation was not the culprit.  Instead he\nbelieved that it was the decreasing amount of gold and silver which\nthe money contained that caused prices to rise. Malestroict was\nconvinced, following the opinions of the time, that gold and silver\nwere representative values that were not influenced by the\nfluctuations of world markets.  Also, while the price of various items\nmight increase, the items were worth a constant amount of gold or\nsilver which did not fluctuate. Because wealth is judged by the\nquantity of money, \u201cthe metals are the true and fair judges of\nmarket value or the price of items.\u201d\nBodin refuted this argument and concentrated on the question of the\nabundance of gold and silver which he considered the principal and\nsingular cause for the high prices of his era. \u201cPreviously no\none had offered such an argument,\u201d he says. In this matter he\nadded two other secondary causes for high prices: the monopolies of\nmerchants and craftsmen, who gathered in guilds and confraternities to\nestablish the price of goods according to their own whims, as well as\nthe scarcity of luxury goods. According to Bodin, war was another\ncause of rising prices: it creates shortages and therefore causes\ngoods to become more expensive.  Bodin posited that the solution to\nthis lay in ending conflicts, since then the parties could occupy\nthemselves with trade amongst themselves rather than waging war. In\nhis opinion on the relationship between money and the price of goods,\nBodin advocated an exchange, \u201cwhich must be honest and free for\nthe wealth and the grandeur of the realm.\u201d He was opposed to the\ndominant opinion of his day, which was that of Malestroict, and which\nheld that the solution to inflation was to attribute legal values to\nmoney by royal edict. For Bodin, the price of gold and silver should\nbe set by the laws of the market, in other words by supply and\ndemand. Hoping to advance these new ideas, Bodin was worried for\npeople overwhelmed by inflation.  According to Bodin a ruler\n\u201cwho changes the price of gold and silver ruins his people,\ncountry and himself.\u201d\n5.2 Theories on Demons\nHis treatment of demonism is written as an antidote to the outbreak\nof sorcery. This contagion was spreading at an alarming rate, thanks\nalso to the society\u2019s growing yet harmful indifference. Bodin trained\nhis sights on Johann Wier (or Weyer; Piscinarius) the former servant\nof the famous master of occult Cornelius Agrippa and tutor to the\nchildren of Jeanne d\u2019Albret (mother of Henry of Navarre, the future\nHenry IV). The work is divided into four books. The first introduces\nthe reader to his basic ideas: the definition of a sorcerer; the\nassociation of demons with men; the difference between good and bad\nspirits; the human and divine means of understanding the mysteries of\nthe occult, and the illicit means for influencing human events. The\nsecond book initiates the reader to magic in general and to silent and\nspoken invocations of evil spirits. Then he comes to the most debated\nquestions, are those who renounce God bodily possessed by demons?\nWhat is lycanthropy?  Can one change humans into animals?  Can\nsorcerers cause illness, sterility, hail, storms, the death of men and\nanimals?  Book III proposes licit remedies against charms and\nincantations, and considers whether it is true that sorcerers have the\npower to heal. Here Bodin also addresses whether sorcerers have the\nability to influence the finding of favor with the powerful, beauty,\nhonors, riches, knowledge, and fertility.  He discusses illicit means\nto prevent and heal evil spells, and the method for driving out evil\nspirits. The fourth book concludes the work by tackling the issues of\nmagical practice and most importantly, the inquisition of\nsorcerers. He examines the methods for proceeding against them, the\nproof required, and the penalties to be inflicted. In most cases Bodin\nrecommends the death penalty by burning.\n5.3 Naturalism\nIn the last years of his life Bodin dedicated himself ambitiously\nto his work, with which he hoped to penetrate the secrets of the\nuniverse. His Theater of Universal Nature (Theatrum)\nis a treatment of the science of nature, or natural philosophy.\nAccording to the title, the work addresses \u201cin five books the\nefficient and final causes of all things of the world.\u201d It is a\nwell-organized encyclopedia of universal knowledge in the form of a\ndialogue between Theorus, a curious theoretician who observers the\nworld and Mystagogus, a master and guide.  The first book examines the\nprincipals of nature and the origin and decline of the world. The\nsecond book addresses the natural elements of meteors, of rocks,\nmetals and fossils.  The third books explores types of animals; the\nfourth addresses the spirit, and the fifth book concerns the number,\nmovement, and grandeur of the heavens respectively. This is an example\nof those works of natural philosophy, which wished to be exhaustive,\nand were typical of the Renaissance. The accusations of naturalism and\natheism, which his Colloquium of the Seven About the Secrets of\nthe Sublime (Heptaplomeres) had provoked, were only\nreignited and expanded by the Theatrum, regardless of the\nfact that he repeatedly refers to an all-powerful creator who admires\nthe \u201corder\u201d in all things.\n6. Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions\nBiographies have attributed religious, political, and philosophical\ndoctrines to Bodin that he may have held. These historians have even\nused the word \u201cconversion\u201d\u2014a strong word in the\nsixteenth century\u2014to make their point. Rose writes of Bodin\u2019s\n\u201cconversion to Judaism\u201d; Moreau-Reibel and Rose of his\n\u201cconversion to the League,\u201d which according to Rose is an\n\u201cact of apostasy\u201d too. Bayle, Naef and Bouchez describe\nhis \u201cconversion to Protestantism,\u201d and Franklin of his\n\u201cconversion to absolutism.\u201d Likewise Bayle and Quaglioni\ndescribe Bodin\u2019s tendency towards religious dissimulation or\nnicodemism. Within the confines of a biography, we are limited to\naddress only the most important aspects of Bodin\u2019s character as a\npolitical actor including his adhesion to the League and his\nabandonment of the \u201cpolitiques.\u201d Concerning the first\npoint, his adhesion to the League, we have examined the Bodin\u2019s\nposition based on his own writings. The second point, Bodin\u2019s\nrelationship to the \u201cpolitiques,\u201d is based on suppositions\nwhich have become nearly a tradition in Bodin scholarship, and has\nbeen perpetuated and reinforced by generation after generation of\nhistorians. Unfortunately these historians have not sought sources on\nwhich to base this claim. In fact, there are no sources that support\nthis argument. Indeed, Bodin never said that he was a\n\u201cpolitique.\u201d Briefly addressing the heart of the matter,\nhistorians have sought to make Bodin a convinced partisan of religious\ntolerance. During Bodin\u2019s lifetime however, religious tolerance,\ndefined as civil tolerance and a legal admission of confessional\ndiversity within a country or city, was not the ideal it would later\nbecome after the eighteenth century. In the sixteenth\ncentury, it was men like S\u00e9bastian Castellion who extolled the\nco-existence of many religions, with which the reformed camp\ndisagreed. The struggle of the Huguenots from the beginning of the\ncivil wars, was to convert the king and realm to the true religion.\nTolerance was not an ideal since one cannot tolerate what one cannot\npossibly accept. For example how could one allow Christ to coexist\nwith Belial, or a false religion to coexist with the one and only true\nreligion?  No further proof of this conviction is needed than the\nfierce struggle both Calvin and Beza waged against Castellion. This\nexample causes one to ask the question: if Castellion supported\nfreedom of religion, why did the leaders of the Reformation, who\nprofessed the same desire, denounce him so fervently?  Because, in the\nreality, the French Reformers did not want freedom of religion which\ncould have \u201copened the door to all manner of sects and\nheresies,\u201d as Calvin said. At the beginning of the wars of\nreligion, they wanted to obtain the recognition of the reformed\nreligion as the sole religion in the realm. Yet, after thirty-six\nyears of war, and after the conversion of Henry of Navarre, they\nunderstood that their project was too ambitious and had to be\nlimited. Only through true religious tolerance could they convert the\nremainder of the kingdom at a later time.  The unity of faith, and\nCalvinist religious concord were the ideal of Reformers\ntoo. Concerning the \u201cpolitiques,\u201d we only have\ndescriptions of them from their adversaries who considered them\natheists and heathens. For instance they were accused of having no\nreligion because they were inclined to admit the definitive\ncoexistence of different forms of worship in the interest of civil\npeace. Nevertheless, why have modern historians, placed men, who they\nconsidered the \u201cmost liberal and sympathetic,\u201d such as\nBodin, Etienne Pasquier, Duplessis-Mornay, Pierre de Beloy and many\nothers in the party of the \u201cpolitiques.\u201d These historians\nhave projected their modern ideals of tolerance, religious freedom,\npluralism, and diversity on to the period of the Wars of\nReligion. Thus these scholars believed they had done a great service\nto the men of the past by presenting them as forerunners of the later\nvalues.  But, as we have seen, Bodin viewed confessional concord as\nthe means capable of returning religious, civil and political unity to\nthe kingdom. It should be recalled however that the problem was not\nthat of \u201cliberty of conscience,\u201d which the French\ngovernment had already guaranteed by edicts in 1563, but the liberty\nto worship. The freedom to worship is also at the heart of the\nquestion of tolerance. When Bodin and many of his contemporaries\nthought about tolerance, it was only as provisional tolerance with the\nhope of achieving civil peace and religious reunification in the\nfuture. For Bodin, concord was essential since it formed the\nfoundation of sovereignty and was necessary for the full exercise of\npower. \nTo be fair to Bodin, the offenses poured out against him by his\nmalicious contemporaries at the time of his adhesion to the League\nshould be analyzed and understood historically. The same goes for the\naccusations of treason, turn-coating, trickery, opportunism,\n\u201cthe charge of his reversal of his belief on religious\ntolerance,\u201d \u201chis slipperiness and lack of principle in\njoining the League,\u201d all of which we find today in his\nbiographies. Bodin\u2019s program of concord and unity was in opposition to\npermanent tolerance and established diversity in juridical, political,\nand theological questions, as we already seen. \n6.1 Particular Questions \n(1) A Judaising Catholic. Did Bodin\u2019s passion for studying Judaic\ntexts arise principally from the influence of his Jewish mother? The\ntrail is a false one since his mother was not Jewish.  (2) Another\nfalse trail concerns how he had miraculously escaped the\nSt. Bartholomew massacre in Paris by seeking refuge with Christophle\nde Thou, the president of the Parlement of Paris \u2014 the story being\n\u201clate and unverifiable\u201daccording to Jacquelin Boucher\n(1983). Paul Collinet, who maintained initially that Bodin was not in\nParis but in the county of Rethelois at the time (Collinet 1908,\n752), later revised his ideas: he had confused J. Bodin de Saint-Amand\n(our J. Bodin) with another, J. B. de Montguichet (Collinet\n1910). This was in accordance with the study of Paul Cornu (Cornu\n1907) about \u201ctwo J. Bodins\u201d.  Nevertheless, Cornu himself\ncannot say where our Bodin was at that\n time.[15]\n In fact, we know nothing for certain about Bodin on the famous night\nof August 24, 1572, nor is it not a matter of central historical\nimportance.  (3) Belief in Witchcraft. Bodin, like the majority of\npeople in the sixteenth century, believed in the devil and the power\nof Satan. These beliefs made his biographers, especially those of the\nnineteenth century, uneasy. They felt that such\nsuperstitions tarnished Bodin\u2019s image.  Baudrillart criticized Bodin\u2019s\nwork Demonomanie and wrote that \u201cAbsurd fanaticism,\nridiculous and obnoxious should be written in the margins of each page\nof this unfortunate book\u201d (Baudrillart 1853, 184, 188\u2013189).\nSuch vain preoccupations and a lack historical sense are two faults,\namong others, that distort the historical analysis of Bodin by those\nwho wish to make him a man of their time rather than allowing\nhim to be a man of his day.\n6.2 Open Questions\nSome recent studies of the Heptaplomeres have tended to\ncast some doubt on Bodin\u2019s authorship of this work. Even if the issue\nof his authorship has not been decisively resolved, one of the\nsecondary but beneficial consequences of these studies is that they\nhave increased our understanding of the on sources which the author of\nthis anonymous text drew \u2014 including not only\nthe Daemonomania as well as the other works by Bodin, but\nalso the writings of Johan Wier (1515\u20131588; Wier 1579).  The\nmost important studies questioninig Bodin\u2019s authorship of the treatise\nare those by Karl F. Faltenbacher (2002, 2009) and David Wootton\n(2002), Jean C\u00e9ard (2009) and Isabelle Pantin\n(2009). Refutations of this thesis, on the other hand, have been\npublished by Jean Letrouit (1995), Andrea Suggi (2005, 2006, 2007) and\nNoel Malcom (2006).\n6.3 Closed questions\nSometimes historical research progresses by leaps and bounds\ninstead of a gradual and steady evolution. Thanks to new research\n(Fontana 2009) we are now in a position to settle on certain issues in\nBodin\u2019s life that have remained matters of conjecture until quite\nrecently, such as his supposed visit to Geneva in 1552 (on which, see\nbelow).  Biographers have been faced with a series of problems\nbecause, throughout his life, he was regularly confused with other\nindividuals also called Jean Bodin, not least within his own family:\nhe was the fourth of seven children, the second of whome was also\ncalled Jean (Levron 1950, 14). For this reason, he has often been\nassigned roles by historians which he may not have played.  He has\nbeen conflated, for instance, with a certain Jean Bodin arrested in\ntwo trials for heresy in Paris, one in 1547 and the other in 1548\n(Weiss 1889, 17\u20138; Naef; Droz; but see Levron 1948).  He has\nalso been confused with Jean Bodin de La Bodini\u00e8re or\nMontguichet who, like our Jean Bodin, was an Angevin and a\ncommissioner for the reformation of forests in Normandy, as well as a\nmember of the household of the duke d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\n(cf. Chauvir\u00e9, 33\u20134; Cornu 1907, 109\u2013111 ; Holt 1986,\n41).  Among the avocats of the Parlement of Paris who swore\nan oath to uphold Catholism in 1562, there were two Jean Bodins, one\nof whom was ours (Delachenal 1885, 405\u20136).  Someone called Jean Bodin\nwas arrested at the priory of Saint-Denis-de-la-Chatre, rue\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy in Paris on March 6, 1569, accused of being of\nthe new opinion\u2019.  He was released on August 23, 1570 following the\nedict of pacification of Saint-Germain (Weiss 1923, 87-9; Droz 1948,\n79; Boucher 1983).  But this cannot be our Jean Bodin (De Caprariis\n1959, 325).  None of the various Jean Bodins of whom we have knowledge\naround 1569 \u2014 the student at Angers, the priest at Bourgueil in\nthe parish of Saint-Aubin du Pavoil near Segr\u00e9, or the merchant\nat St-Maurice \u2014 correspond to the Jean Bodin in whom we are\ninterested (Levron 1948, 73\u20134).  Nor ashould we identify Jean Bodin\nthe philosopher with his various namesakes (Couzinet 1996, 240) who\nwere implicated in the trial of La M\u00f4le and Coconnas in 1574\n(Holt 1986, 41) or accompanied Brisson on a mission in 1581\n(Moreau-Reibel 1933, 258), or got mixed up in the Champvallon affair\nof the following year (Radouant 1970, 45) or were suspected of having\nparticipated in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth I of England\n(Rose 1980, 215\u20136).\nEqually, there is no tangible or demonstrable proof to support the\nsupposed Protestant leanings of Bodin.  Roger Chauvir\u00e9 (1914,\n24) speculated, on the basis of his hypothetical stay in Geneva in\n1552, that he had perhaps converted to the new faith.  This particular\nsupposition is linked to another, more general one, that Bodin had a\ntruly reformed religiosity, coexisting with his other judaising\ntendencies and inclinations towards natural religion. This is why\nthere is a persistent tendency among certain historians to perceive\nhim as a dissimulating Protestant and \u2018Nicodemite\u2019.\nFollowing Naef and Droz, they believe that Bodin can be identified\nwith \u2018Jehan Bodin de Sainct-Amand diocese de Bourges\u2019\n(following Bordier, who, however, provides no references to Jean\nBodin, author of the Republic) who spent time in Geneva in\n1552, asking to be received as inhabitant there, who married\nTyph\u00e8ne Renault and had an argument with J\u00e9r\u00f4me\nBolsec (Naef and Droz, 83) and who even became a minister of the Holy\nWord (Weiss, contradicted by Naef, 153; but see Droz, 83).  All these\nhypotheses, however, have been undermined now that Letizia Fontana\n(2009) has demonstrated that the Jean Bodin who was present in Geneva\nin 1552 cannot possibly have been the philosopher. That said, it still\nremains possible that Bodin occasionally felt sympathy, on the\nreligious grounds, towards Protestantism and Protestants in general,\nthough this stopped short of adherence to the confession of the\nReformed faith.  Such an attitude could often be found among moderate\nCatholics, men of letters, jurists, writers and even theologians and\nwas not in conflict with Bodin\u2019s severely negative assessment \u2014\non a purely political level \u2014 of the Huguenots as a result of\ntheir raising arms against their sovereign.\n7. Publications, Conferences and Projects, 2013\u20132018\n\nIn 2013 two important Bodin editions appeared. Sara \nMiglietti published her doctoral dissertation (Scuola Normale\nSuperiore, Pisa): Jean Bodin, Methodus ad facilem historiarum\ncongnitione, edizione, introduzione e commento di S. Miglietti,\nPisa: Edizioni della Normale, with an accompanying Italian translation.\nIn addition, Mario Turchetti published a critical edition of the first\nbook of the French text of La R\u00e9publique with a\nparallel Latin edition of  De\nRepublica, translated by Bodin and published in 1586 (see\nCotroneo 2014 \u2018Il ritorno di Bodin\u2019); N. de Araujo is\nresponsible for the text, and the preface is by Q. Skinner. This\nvolume, the first of a projected six volume edition, is now available\nonline from\nClassiques Garnier.\n\nIts publication was the occasion for an international conference at\nthe University of Fribourg (4\u20135 October 2013); and another is\nplanned for 5 March 2015, organized by the Universities of Paris-IV\nSorbonne (Denis Crouzet) and Paris-VI Descartes (Yves Charles\nZarka).\n\nAn international conference was held in Oxford in June 2014 (St\nAnne\u2019s College): \u2018Community, Government and Territoriality in the\nPolitical Thought of Jean Bodin\u2019, organised by Sophie Nicholls\nand Anne Becker.\n\nThe Reception of Bodin, edited by Howell A.  Lloyd, was\npublished in Leiden by Brill in 2013. The volume presents the\nsixteenth-century jurist as a \u201cprismatic agent\u201d through\nwhose works a vast inherited juridical, philosophical, religious,\npolitical and anthropological fabric of learning of the West was\ndisseminated in a revitalised form into world ripe for modernity.\n\n\nAt Tufts University (Boston, USA), a \u2018Bodin Project\u2019 has\nnow been launched by Ioannis Evrigenis, the aim of which is to make\navailable online the French, Latin and English (Six Bookes of a\nCommonweale in Richard Knolly\u2019s 1606 translation) texts of Bodin\u2019s\nRepublic. The digitized editions produced by the \u2018Bodin\nProject\u2019 will, in due course, become part of the vast range of\nworks consultable online from the \n (Perseus Digital Library).\n\nAnother \n Bodin Project\n was originally based at the\nUniversity of Hull and is now based at Harvard.\n\n\nThe \u2018Bodin Sources Project\u2019, directed by Professor Kenneth\nD. McRae, aims to list the sources mentioned in five of Bodin\u2019s major\nworks \u2013 Methodus, R\u00e9publique,\nD\u00e9monomanie, Theatrum and the commentary on\nOppian \u2013 in machine-readable form. For further information,\ncontact: K. D. McRae, Department of Political Science, Carleton\nUniversity, 1125 Colonel by Drive, Ottawa ON K1S 5B6 Canada.\n\nThe hectic pace of Bodin studies has not let up in recent years; for\nbrevity\u2019s sake, however, only the most important contributions\nwill be singled out here. Anna Di Bello (2014) traces in detail the\nway in which the Latin translation of La R\u00e9publique\nwas made, providing a new understanding of Bodin\u2019s elaboration\nof his masterpiece. The parallels between the French and Latin\nversions, the collation of the two texts, and the comparisons between\nthem provide the opportunity to evaluate Bodin\u2019s preoccupations\nat two distinct moments in time.  Those preoccupations include his\nconceptions of the State and the optimal structure for the realization\nof a polity which, beyond the good ordering and right administration\nof society, ensures the exercise of a sovereignty that preserves\n\u2018harmonic justice\u2019 in a royal monarchy such as\nFrance. Daniel Lee (2016) explores the Roman Law sources that underlie\nthe emergence, and rise to prominence, of the theory of popular\nsovereignty in the early modern period. In two chapters, he seeks to\nundermine the traditional idea that Bodin is an\n\u2018absolutist\u2019 and tries to present him in a more authentic\nlight.  Howell A. Lloyd (2017) reconstructs the intellectual biography\nof Bodin in a novel way. Finally, Turchetti (2018) examines the\ndistinction between despotism and tyranny, which was essential to\nBodin as the juridico-political foundation of the right of resistance,\nbut which was progressively forgotten in later centuries.\n\nDespite this welcome resurgence of interest in Bodin, a remaining\ndeisderatum is a new English translation of Bodin\u2019s\nRepublic, one which meets the needs of twenty-first-century\nresearchers.",
