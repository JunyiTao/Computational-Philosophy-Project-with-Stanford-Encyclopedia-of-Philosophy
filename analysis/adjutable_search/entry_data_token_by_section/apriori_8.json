Should we think that rational intuitions provide evidence for the propositions that are their objects?\n\nThe answer to this question requires first answering another question:\nwhat are intuitions? As noted above, Bealer distinguishes between\nphysical intuitions, such as the intuition that a house undermined\nwill fall (1998: 207, 211, 213; 1992: 102, 104), and rational\nintuitions. Here are several of Bealer\u2019s examples of rational\nintuitions from (1998): if P, then not not P (207); if\nP or Q, then it is not the case that both not P\nand not Q (210); that Gettier situations are possible (207:\n211\u201312); that phenomenal colors are incompatible (211); that if\nspatial region x is a part of spatial region y and\nspatial region y is part of spatial region z, then\nspatial region x is part of spatial region z (212). At\none point Bealer says that the difference between a physical and a\nrational intuition is that a rational intuition \u201cpresents itself\nas necessary\u201d, but he immediately goes on to say that he does\nnot know exactly how to analyze this notion. A proposal he offers is\nthe following: if x (rationally) intuits P, then it\nseems to x that P and also that necessarily P.\nBut later he says that in Gettier cases there are rational intuitions\nabout the situation described being possible (1998: 206, 207,\n211\u201312), and he explicitly says, \u201cWithout possibility\nintuitions, philosophy would be fatally flawed\u201d (1998: 212;\nmy italics). It seems that what Bealer holds is that a rational\nintuition that P is one where it either seems that P and\nalso necessarily that P, OR it seems that it is possible that\nP. As we have seen, Malmgren argued that in Gettier cases the\nrelevant intuition is that it is possible that a person in\nthe relevant circumstances have a justified true belief but lack\nknowledge. Bealer\u2019s remark about an intuition\u2019s presenting\nitself as necessary was only meant as a way of contrasting the\nphysical intuition that a house undermined will fall with some other\nrational intuitions. For Bealer, rational intuitions involve modal\nseemings, either about what is necessary or possible.\n\nBealer offers a complicated multi-stage argument for why intuitions,\nso understood, provide evidence. Part of his argument involves\ndistinguishing basic from derivative sources of evidence. Some\ncontingent sources of evidence provide justification but only because\nsome basic source justifies their use. Perhaps perception is a basic\nsource of evidence and testimony derivative. But what makes a source\nof evidence basic? For Bealer, a source of evidence is basic if and\nonly if its deliverances have an appropriate kind of modal\ntie to the truth (1998: 218). His view is that a source has the\nappropriate modal tie if and only if, necessarily, its deliverances\nwould be true for the most part, that is, would be reliable, when that\nsource is employed by someone in cognitive conditions of suitable high\nquality (for short, in ideal conditions) (1998: 219). In short, the\nappropriate modal tie to the truth is the source\u2019s being\nnecessarily reliable when the person using it is in ideal cognitive\ncircumstances. This account of a basic source of evidence explains why\nguessing is not a basic source of evidence for a person who happens to\nbe a reliable guesser: guessing in that special world would be\nreliable but not in all other possible worlds. But is rational\nintuition a basic source of evidence on this account?\n\nBealer argues that rational intuitions depend on concept possession\nand if one fully understands a concept, they will be necessarily\nreliable in ideal cognitive conditions in applying that concept. A\nperson can misunderstand a concept such as arthritis and apply it to\npains in the thigh, or incompletely understand it by not knowing\nwhether it applies to a certain case or not. For example, someone\nmight not understand the concept of a contract well enough to know\nwhether it applies to any oral agreements (1998: 221). But full\nunderstanding of concepts is incompatible with any misunderstanding or\nincomplete understanding.\n\nBealer says, \u201cOur intuitions are what seem to be so concerning\nthe applicability of concepts to cases presented to pure\nthought\u201d (1998: 231). And what seems to be so is modal,\nsomething\u2019s being possible or necessary. For instance, if a\nperson who fully understands the concept knowledge is presented a\nGettier case, the relevant intuition for Bealer will be that it seems\npossible for the person in the Gettier scenario to have a\njustified true belief but lack knowledge. If a person who fully\nunderstands \u201cspatial part\u201d is asked whether it\u2019s\ntrue that if x is a part of y, and y a part of\nz, then x is a part of z, the relevant intuition\nfor Bealer will be that it seems necessarily true.\n\nBealer further maintains that we are not now in the relevant ideal\nconditions. However, he does say that, \n\n\nif we limit ourselves to suitably elementary propositions, then\nrelative to them we approximate ideal cognitive conditions,\n\n\n\nand that \n\n\nthe deliverances of our basic sources would provide in an approximate\nway the kind of pathway to the truth they would have generally in\nideal conditions. (1998: 219) \n\n\nHe is saying that even in our current non-ideal cognitive condition\nthe deliverances of our basic sources, which include rational\nintuitions, can be somewhat reliable even if not as reliable as they\nwould be in ideal conditions. He also thinks that for many of us the\nclass of elementary propositions \u201cwould not be\ninconsiderable\u201d (1998: 219). Bealer is probably thinking of the\nmany readily accessible conceptual connections such as those in\n 1a\u201315a\n given near the beginning of this entry.\n\nCasullo recommends a different approach to defending rationalism. He\nthinks rationalists should start from common ground and that they\nshould \u201cenlist empirical support for the existence of a priori\nknowledge\u201d (2012a: 248\u2013249). This may be because he thinks\nthat nonexperiential mental states are the basis of a priori\njustification and \u201cnonexperiential mental state\u201d is a\nnatural kind term. This seems plausible because Casullo thinks that\n\u201cexperience\u201d is a natural kind term (see, below,\n sec. 6.4).\n He may think that the reference of all natural kind terms must be\ndiscovered empirically and so think that what he takes as the basis of\na priori justification must be discovered empirically.\nSuppose the nonexperiential mental states that Casullo thinks are the\nbases of a priori justification are what other philosophers\ncall \u201cintuitions\u201d. If a priori knowledge rests\npartly on a priori justification, and that rests on\n\u201cintuitions\u201d, that could explain why Casullo recommends\nempirical inquiry as a means to discover what intuitions are like as a\nfirst step in explaining how they can provide a priori\njustification.\n\nBealer seems to disagree with Casullo about the nature of intuitions.\nHe has written that empirical investigation into people\u2019s\n\u201cintuitions\u201d is irrelevant because they do not investigate\nintuitions in the relevant sense, that is, intuitions understood as\nresponses to fully understanding propositions (1998: 202). Casullo\nseems to understand intuitions differently, as a certain kind of\nmental state whose nature must be discovered empirically. Insofar as a\ndefense of rationalism involves a defense of the epistemic role of\nintuitions, it is not surprising that Bealer and Casullo suggest\ndifferent ways of defending rationalism given that they have different\nviews about the nature of intuitions.\n",
