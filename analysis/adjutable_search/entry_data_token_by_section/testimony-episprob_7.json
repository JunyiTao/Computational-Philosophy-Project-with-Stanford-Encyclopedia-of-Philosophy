Because you know that your friend is almost always\nright about this kind of thing, and because you have no reason to\ndoubt what they are telling you on this occasion, you believe what you\nare told.\n\nWhile it is uncontroversial that your belief is justified in this\ncase, scenarios like this one have generated lots of debate about the\nfollowing question:\n\n\nThird Big Question: When a hearer is justified in believing\nthat p on the basis of a speaker\u2019s testimony, is the\nhearer\u2019s belief justified by evidence? And if the hearer\u2019s\nbelief is justified by evidence, where does this evidence come\nfrom?\n\n",
