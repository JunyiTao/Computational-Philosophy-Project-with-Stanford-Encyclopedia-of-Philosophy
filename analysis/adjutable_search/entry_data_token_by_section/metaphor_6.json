    "main_text": "Four Traditions || Comparativist Accounts\n4.3 Comparativist Accounts\n\nAncient Greek poetry was rich in extended explicit\ncomparisons\u2014similes\u2014of the sort we now call epic\nor Homeric. At Iliad 20.164\u201373, Aeneas is\nbearing down on Achilles when the roles of attacker and attacked are\nabruptly reversed; this is a literal rendering from (Stott, 2006):\n\n\u2026 He rushed against him like a rapacious lion\n\nthat men are eager to kill, the whole town,\n\nonce they have gathered. He ignores them\n\ngoing his own way, but when one of the young men, swift in battle,\n\nstrikes him with a spear, then he crouches down with open mouth,\n\nfoam appears around his teeth, and his brave spirit groans in his\nheart,\n\nand he lashes his ribs and flanks with his tail\n\non both sides, urging himself to fight.\n\nWith glowing eyes he charges forcefully forward\n\nto see if he will kill one of the men or himself be slain in the\ncrowd.\n\n\nAncient rhetoricians would maintain that Homer\u2019s simile and a\nmetaphor employing the epithet \u201cthe lion\u201d so as to\nmanifestly refer to the man Achilles are alike in that they make or\npresent one and the same comparison, each in its own way: both bits of\nlanguage compare Achilles to a lion. Aristotle goes\non to contend that \u201csimiles are metaphors needing an explanatory\nword\u201d (Poetics 1407a)\u2014as if the difference\nbetween the \u201cThe lion [Achilles] rushed\u201d (metaphor) and\n\u201cHe [Achilles] rushed as a lion\u201d (simile) came down to the\npresence in the latter of a stage direction indicating that Achilles\nwent on the attack in the guise of a lion. A simile is thus a\nlengthened metaphor. Quintilian turns things round, speaking of\nmetaphors as shortened similes:\n\nIn general terms, Metaphor is a shortened form of Simile; the\ndifference is that in Simile something is [overtly] compared with the\nthing we wish to describe, while in metaphor one thing is substituted\nfor the other.\u2014Institutio Oratoria, ca. 95 AD, 8.6,\n8\u20139.\n\n\nLike his fellow ancients, Quintilian conceived metaphor as an affair\nof terms rather than as an affair of sentences. A metaphorical\nemployment of the term \u201clion\u201d to refer to the man Achilles\ndoesn\u2019t say that Achilles is like a lion, since it\ndoesn\u2019t say anything at all. Namings aren\u2019t\nsayings; they merely pave the way for sayings. What Quintilian meant,\nthen, is that a simile states the real or alleged similarity\n(of Achilles to lions) which the corresponding metaphorical\nsubstitution leaves to a listener\u2019s imagination.\n\nOnce we come to view the sentence as the fundamental unit of\nmetaphorical action, Quintilian\u2019s remark suggests something to\nus that it couldn\u2019t suggest to Quintilian himself: what a simple\nsentence metaphor (Juliet is the sun, History is a\nnightmare) really says is that Juliet is like the\nsun, history like a nightmare\u2014where the extent and\nnature of the alleged likeness are things listeners must infer from\nthe concrete conversational setting in which the metaphor is employed.\nIt suggests that a sentence metaphor is an elliptical simile, a\nfigurative comparison whose key comparative construction is understood\nto be present but remains unpronounced. Some such comparativist\naccount of metaphor has been proposed from time to time by modern\ncritics (Nowottny, 1962) and by modern linguists (Ortony, 1979).\n\nAn especially detailed version was developed by Robert Fogelin (1998)\nfrom suggestions by Amos Tversky (1977).\n\nFor Fogelin, to speak figuratively is to speak so as to\nstand corrected, to speak so as to manifestly invite and reliably\nelicit some particular spontaneous correction from one\u2019s\naudience. This is easiest to see and easiest to understand when it\ncomes to figurative predications, e.g. instances of irony or\nunderstatement. In such cases correcting the speaker consists\nin correcting what she said by understanding her to have said\none thing while meaning another. Listeners take the speaker\u2019s\nactual words and edit them in the privacy of their own heads, thereby\nbringing her utterance into accord with the context in which she spoke\nthem as called for by Gricean conversational principles. When a\nspeaker indulges in understatement, correction of what she says\ninvolves strengthening it; when she indulges in irony, our correction\ninvolves reversing it (in some sense or other, the nature of the\nreversal varying from case to case), and so forth. Often the value and\ninterest of a thought is enhanced by the listener\u2019s coming up\nwith it for himself and deciding for himself that it is appropriate to\nthe circumstances in which he finds himself. Figurative predication is\none way to impose these tasks on a listener; that\u2019s one of our\nmain reasons for resorting to it.\n\nWhether it is to be taken literally or figuratively, an\nunqualified simple comparison\n\n(an) A is like (a) B\n\n\nis to be understood as saying that (an) A has enough of the\nfeatures of (a) B that are salient in the present context. Or\nif you prefer, (an) A is similar enough to (a) B in\nrespects that concern aspects of (a) B that\nare salient in the present context. What counts as enough in\nthe way of shared salient B-features or enough in\nthe way of similarity to B in salient B-respects\ndepends in turn on the contextually salient interests or concerns that\nare understood to motivate the making of the comparison in the first\nplace. So whether they are to be taken literally or figuratively,\nunqualified simple comparisons have highly context-sensitive truth\nconditions.\n\nFogelin follows Tversky in supposing that when we compare (an)\nA to (a) B, it is the currently salient features or\naspects of the second thing or kind of thing that call the\ntune. This represents a break with how likeness or resemblance or\nsimilarity has usually been construed in the philosophical\nliterature\u2014viz., as a symmetric relation, with the\nresult that (an) A is like (a) B just in case, or\njust to the extent that, (a) B is like (an) A. On\nthe understanding of likeness talk being offered here, this\nwon\u2019t be true at least in general. And Fogelin seems right about\nthis:\n\nTo start with a personal experience, I was once struck by the present\nPope\u2019s likeness (in a photograph) to Arnold Palmer. [The Pope at\nthe time was John Paul II.] It was not difficult to identify the\nsource of the likeness: the Pope has Arnold Palmer\u2019s eyes. At\nthe same time, I felt no compulsion to say that Arnold Palmer looked\nlike the Pope. Why not? The answer, I think, is that Arnold\nPalmer\u2019s eyes\u2014that crinkled down-the-fairway\nsquint\u2014are one of the distinctive features of his face: it would\nappear, for instance, in caricatures drawn of him. On the other hand,\nArnold Palmer\u2019s eyes are not distinctive features of the\nPope\u2019s face. Put very crudely, it seemed to me that the Pope\nresembled Arnold Palmer, but not conversely, because the Pope\npossessed one of Arnold Palmer\u2019s distinctive features whereas\nArnold Palmer did not possess a distinctive feature of the Pope. (43)\n\n\nComparisons have conversationally adjustable contents, resulting from\nthe attribution of conversationally adjustable contents to comparative\nconstructions such as is like. To assign a comparative\nstatement a particular truth-value, one must bring to bear a\nconversationally adjustable canon of similarity, telling us\nhow much like (a) B and in what respects a thing A\nneeds to be in order for A to count as unqualifiedly like (a)\nB for present conversational purposes. For instance, in\nordinary contexts governed by a routine default canon of\nsimilarity,\n\n(1) A road grader is like a bulldozer\n\n\ncomes out true, since \u201clike bulldozers, road graders are also\nused to push around large quantities of dirt, the chief difference\nbeing that road graders have their blades beneath the chassis rather\nthan in front of them.\u201d (88)\n\nWe\u2019re now in a position to draw a distinction between literal\ncomparisons and figurative comparisons, similes, that accords with the\nidea that to speak figuratively is to speak so as to stand corrected.\nFigurative comparisons invite a different kind of correction than\nfigurative predications do.\n\nTo take a comparison literally is to assess it in the light\nof a canon of similarity already in play when the comparison is\nuttered, a generally prevailing or already\nprevailing canon of similarity. This is how we always take a\ncomparison on first encountering it. And when the content we thereby\nassign it is fully in accord with Gricean conversational principles,\nthis is the only way we ever do take it, the way we presume we were\nintended to take it all along. Such is how we take (1), for\nexample.\n\nBut sometimes taking a comparison literally yields a content that is\nmanifestly false, manifestly uninformative, or otherwise at odds with\nconversational principles. Such is the case with\n\n(2) Margaret Thatcher is like a bulldozer.\n\n\n\u201cMargaret Thatcher cannot, for example, move huge quantities of\ndirt in an efficient manner\u201d (87). Nor is she routinely prepared\nto get dirty in any literal sense. Listeners can be counted on to know\nas much and notice as much. So confronted with (2), they cast about\nfor a possible adjustment to the previously prevailing canon of\nsimilarity that brings the content of (2) into line with\nconversational principles and is manifestly smaller, manifestly more\nnatural, manifestly easier to make, than any other adjustment that\nwould do the trick. This adjustment relaxes the standards of\nhow like a bulldozer a thing needs to be in order to be\njust plain like a bulldozer, like a bulldozer without\nqualification. And it bestows fresh salience on relatively\nabstract features of bulldozers, features a powerful person might\ncredibly share: an ability to take on large tasks, an ability to wear\ndown large obstacles a little at a time, a certain gracelessness in\nmoment-to-moment operation, etc.\n\nWhen they think they\u2019ve hit on such a possible adjustment,\nlisteners promptly implement it: they reinterpret the comparison in\naccord with the adjusted canon of similarity and take the resulting\nadjusted content to be what the speaker intended to get across all\nalong. (The whole process takes place without conscious inference;\nindeed, this is part of what makes the adjustment a natural one in\nFogelin\u2019s eyes.) To take a comparison figuratively is simply to\nexecute this kind of adjustment in how we interpret it. A\nsimile, a figurative comparative statement, is simply a\ncomparison that manifestly requires and therefore routinely receives\nthis kind of adjusted truth-conditional interpretation. When a simile\nis figuratively true, it will ordinarily be literally false\u2014it\nwill compare things such that the first is unlike the second\nby generally prevailing or previously prevailing standards, yet the\nfirst is like the second by new standards the simile\nitself helps to impose; this is the sense in which a simile is an\nexhibition of unity in variety, a likening of dissimilar things.\n\nThis account of how similes differ from more routine literal\ncomparisons predicts that similes exhibit the same kind of\nreversibility failure as their literal counterparts and do so for\nfundamentally the same reason. And this prediction seems to be\ncorrect. Witness this observation from the novelist William H.\nGass:\n\n[In the Song of Solomon, we read] \u201cThy teeth are like a flock of\nsheep that are even shorn, which come up from the washing; whereof\nevery one bears twins, and none is barren among them.\u201d \u2026\nMay I comfortably think of those sheep as wandering teeth? (Gass 1995,\n40)\n\n\nAs with comparisons generally, our interest in a simile usually\nisn\u2019t an interest in the bare fact of likeness; it\u2019s an\ninterest in the specific features of (an) A in virtue of\nwhich it\u2019s figuratively like (a) B. So: ordinarily a\nlistener is expected to infer for himself or notice for himself what\nit is about (an) A that\u2019s supposed to make it count as\nlike (a) B by these newly prevailing, adjusted standards:\n\nwhat it is about A that in fact makes it enough like (a)\nB by these standards (in the case of figurative truth);\n\n\nwhat it is about A that we are supposed to think makes it\nenough like (a) B by these standards (in the case of\nfigurative falsity).\n\n\nTo do this is to paraphrase the simile in question. In the\ncase of (2), we might come up with something along the lines of\n\n(3) Thatcher is a gross, powerful person who overcomes all obstacles\nin getting the job done. (Tversky, 1977, 351)\n\n\nOn being told by Gertrude Stein that his portrait of her didn\u2019t\nlook much like her, Picasso is said to have responded,\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will.\u201d If we call such portraits,\nportraits that vindicate themselves in the fullness of time by\nimposing their own novel standards of vindication, Picasso\nlikenesses, we might say that on Fogelin\u2019s account of\nthings, similes are Picasso likenings.\n\nIf we can understand\n\n(4) Margaret Thatcher is a bulldozer.\n\n\nas somehow short for (2), we\u2019ll see how (3) is in order as a\nparaphrase of (4) as well. We\u2019ll have a ready explanation of the\nfact that there is all the difference in the world between saying in a\nspirit of metaphor that money is blood (a stuff\nwhich invigorates by circulating and facilitating vital exchanges) and\nsaying in a spirit of metaphor that blood is money\n(in that parting with it, letting it be shed, is a powerful but\ndrastic way of obtaining precious things). As for the fact that\nmetaphors often invite more subtle and ambitious readings than the\ncorresponding similes would in their place, ellipsis itself has\npowerful effects on how words are best interpreted in context. Imagine\ntrying to find precise, conversationally natural, non-elliptical\nequivalents for such cleverly crafted ellipses as these:\n\nGarbage in, garbage out.\n\n\nFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\n\n",
