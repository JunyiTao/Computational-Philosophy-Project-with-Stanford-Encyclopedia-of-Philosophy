    "main_text": "Voting Paradoxes || The Multiple Elections Paradox\n3.4 The Multiple Elections Paradox\n\nThe paradox discussed in this section, first introduced by Brams,\nKilgour and Zwicker (1998), has a somewhat different structure from\nthe paradoxes discussed above. Voters are taking part in a\nreferendum, where they are asked their opinion directly about\nvarious propositions (cf. the discussion of Quadratic Voting and Liquid Democracy\n in Section 2.3). So, voters must select either \u201cyes\u201d\n(Y) or \u201cno\u201d (N) for each proposition. Suppose that there\nare 13 voters who cast the following votes for the three propositions (so\nvoters can cast one of eight possible votes): \n\n# VotersPropositions\n1YYY \n1YYN \n1YNY \n3YNN \n1NYY \n3NYN \n3NNY \n0NNN \n\n\nWhen the votes are tallied for each proposition separately, the\noutcome is N for each proposition (N wins 7\u20136 for all three\npropositions). Putting this information together, this means that NNN\nis the outcome of this election. However, there is no support\nfor this outcome in this population of voters.  This raises an important \nquestion about what outcome reflects the group opinion: Viewing each proposition \nseparately, there is clear support for N on each proposition; however, \nthere is no support for the entire package of N for all propositions. \nBrams et al. (1998,  pg. 234) nicely summarise the issue as follows: \n\nThe paradox does not just highlight problems of aggregation and\npackaging, however, but strikes at the core of social\nchoice\u2014both what it means and how to uncover it. In our view,\nthe paradox shows there may be a clash between two different meanings\nof social choice, leaving unsettled the best way to uncover what this\nelusive quantity is.\n\n\nSee Scarsini 1998, Lacy  and Niou 2000, Xia et al. 2007, and Lang and Xia 2009 for further discussion of this paradox. \n\n\nA similar issue is raised by Anscombe\u2019s paradox (Anscombe\n1976), in which: \n\nIt is possible for a majority of voters to be on the losing side of a\nmajority of issues.\n\n\nThis phenomenon is illustrated by the following example with five\nvoters voting on three different issues (the voters either vote\n\u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on the different issues).\n\nIssue 1Issue 2Issue 3\nVoter 1yesyesno\nVoter 2nonono\nVoter 3noyesyes\nVoter 4yesnoyes\nVoter 5yesnoyes\nMajority: yesnoyes\n\n\n\nHowever, a majority of the voters (voters 1, 2 and 3) do not\nsupport the majority outcome on a majority of the issues (note that\nvoter 1 does not support the majority outcome on issues 2 and 3; voter\n2 does not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 3; and voter 3\ndoes not support the majority outcome on issues 1 and 2)! \n\nThe issue is more interesting when the voters do not vote directly on\nthe issues, but on candidates that take positions on the different\nissues. Suppose there are two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) who take the\nfollowing positions on the three issues: \n\nIssue 1Issue 2Issue 3\nCandidate \\(A\\)yesnoyes\nCandidate \\(B\\)noyesno\n\n\nCandidate \\(A\\) takes the majority position, agreeing with a majority\nof the voters on each issue, and candidate \\(B\\) takes the opposite,\nminority position. Under the natural assumption that voters will vote\nfor the candidate who agrees with their position on a majority of the\nissues, candidate \\(B\\) will win the election (each of the voters 1, 2\nand 3 agree with \\(B\\) on two of the three issues, so \\(B\\) wins the\nelection 3\u20132)! This version of the paradox is known as\nOstrogorski\u2019s Paradox (Ostrogorski 1902). See Kelly 1989; Rae\nand Daudt 1976; Wagner 1983, 1984; and Saari 2001, Section 4.6, for\nanalyses of this paradox, and Pigozzi 2005 for the relationship with \n\tthe judgement aggregation literature (List 2013, Section 5).\n",
