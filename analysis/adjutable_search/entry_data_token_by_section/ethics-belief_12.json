    "main_text": "Evidentialism: an overview || Evidence and its possession\n4.3 Evidence and its possession\n\nCrucial to any theory in the ethics of belief\u2014and especially an\nEvidentialist theory\u2014will be some account of the nature of\nevidence itself. Some philosophers construe evidence in terms\nof demonstrative proof, others in terms of objective and/or subjective\nprobability, and others simply in terms of anything that belief is\nresponsive to (see the entry on\n evidence).\n A fully articulate Evidentialism will also provide an account of how\nevidence supports belief (see the entry on the\n epistemic basing relation),\n and of what it is to have or possess such\nevidence.\n\nIt will also, perhaps, say something about whether there can be\nevidence (arguments) in favor of having a belief that p or\nbringing about the belief that p, in addition to evidence in\nfavor of p itself (see Reisner 2008). It will presumably also\nhave something to say about disagreement between epistemic peers, and\nthe impact that such disagreement can have on our conception of the\ndoxastic norms, especially if the disagreement is not based on a\ndifference in evidence (van Inwagen 1996, Kelly 2005). Finally, it\nmight take a stand on the more general issue of how higher-order\nevidence interacts with first-order evidence. For example: in the case\nof peer disagreement, knowing that a peer disagrees with you is a\npiece of higher-order evidence regarding your first-order belief.\n\nWith respect to reflective access conditions, it was noted earlier\nthat Evidentialists cannot require that a rational subject\nalways base beliefs on sufficient evidence that she knows or\njustifiably believes she has, for fear of an infinite regress. If that\nis correct, then another less demanding sort of principle must be in\nthe offing, one according to which at least some beliefs can simply be\nheld on the basis of sufficient evidence, regardless of whether the\nsubject has any beliefs about that evidence.\n\nOn the issue of evidence-possession generally: if we regard evidence\nas wholly constituted by mental states (experiences, beliefs,\nmemories, etc.), then an account of what it is to\n\u201cpossess\u201d evidence will be relatively\nstraightforward\u2014we must simply have these mental states. If\nevidence is not merely in the head, so to speak, then the possession\ncondition in Evidentialist norms may turn out to be quite complex.\nWhat is our evidence for the belief that \u201cit's raining\u201d?\nIs it our awareness or experience of something, such as the street's\nbeing wet? Or is it simply the street's being wet? When asked why we\nbelieve that it is raining, we typically say something like\n\u201cbecause the street is wet.\u201d Is this merely shorthand or\ndoes it say something about the nature of evidence? (For arguments\nthat extra-mental facts in the world often constitute evidence, see\nMcDowell 1994 and Ginsborg 2007; for further discussion see Williamson\n2000 and Dancy 2000, ch.6).\n",
