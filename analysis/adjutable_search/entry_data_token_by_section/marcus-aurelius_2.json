    "main_text": "Living Stoically\n2. Living Stoically\n\n\nAlthough he acknowledges that he struggles to live as a philosopher,\nMarcus urges himself to that life, spelling out what it involves in\nStoic terms:\n\u2026you are no longer able to have lived your whole\nlife as a philosopher since youth; and it is clear to many others and\nto you yourself that you are far from philosophy. So you are confused:\nthe result is that obtaining the reputation of a philosopher is no\nlonger easy for you \u2026 If you have seen truly where the matter\nlies, then leave behind your reputation and be content even if you\nlive the remainder of life, however long [it may be], as your nature\nwills. Consider what it wills, and let nothing else distract you. For\nyour experience tells you how much you have strayed: nowhere in\nso-called reasonings, wealth, reputation, enjoyment, nowhere do you\nfind living well. So where is it? In doing those things which\nhuman nature seeks. And how will one do these things? If one has\ndoctrines from which [flow] one\u2019s impulses and actions. Which\ndoctrines?  Those concerning goods and evils: that nothing is good for\na human being which does not make them just, temperate, courageous,\nfree; that nothing is bad, which does not make them the contraries of\nthe aforementioned. (viii.1, emphasis mine)\n In saying that living well lies in doing what his human nature seeks,\nMarcus is echoing generations of Stoic philosophers.  Cleanthes says\nthe goal (telos) is \u2018living in agreement with nature\u2019; Chrysippus,\n\u2018living according to the experience of what happens by\nnature\u2019; Diogenes, \u2018being reasonable in the selection and\nrejection of what is according to nature\u2019; Archedemus,\n\u2018living completing all appropriate actions\u2019; Antipater,\n\u2018living continually selecting what is according to nature and\nrejecting what is contrary to nature\u2019 (Arius Didymus 6a). These\nformulae indicate that the goal is to act in accordance with nature,\nand to be in a certain cognitive state in relation to one\u2019s acts\naccording to nature: in agreement, on the basis of experience, being\nreasonable, continually (dienek\u00f4s, i.e. consistently, stably?), all of which\nimply understanding. \n\n\nBut how is a Stoic to put this into practice?  What is it to do what one\u2019s human nature seeks, in the particular circumstances in which one finds oneself?  Surely it does not mean doing whatever is one\u2019s strongest desire to do in the moment.\n\n\nIn the passage quoted, Marcus explains how one might do what is in\none\u2019s nature by saying that one must modify one\u2019s beliefs about good\nand bad, as these inform one\u2019s impulses and actions.  He says, for\nexample, that if we believe that pleasure is good and pain evil, then\nwe will be resentful of the pleasures enjoyed by the vicious and the\npains suffered by the virtuous. And if we are resentful of what\nhappens, we will be finding fault with Nature and will be impious\n(ix.3). But while false beliefs about good and bad hinder us from\nfollowing nature and acting virtuously, how can their removal by\nitself enable us to follow nature and act virtuously? Once I know that\npleasure and pain are neither good nor evil but are indifferent for my happiness, I still need to know how I should respond to\nthis pleasure and that pain, in order to be following nature. The\nfirst century Stoic philosopher Seneca argues in his Letters to Lucilius for the\nusefulness of concrete advice for certain types of situations\n(praecepta) on the grounds that having eliminated vice and\nfalse opinion, one will not yet know what to do and how to do it\n(94.23), for inexperience, not only passion, prevents us from knowing\nwhat to do in each situation (94.32); Seneca also says that nature\ndoes not teach us what the appropriate action is in every case\n(94.19). Perhaps Marcus thinks that there is, in every choice\nsituation, something one can do that is productive of virtue (he says,\n\u2018nothing is good for a human being which does not make\nhim just, temperate, courageous, free\u2019; on the other hand,\n\u2018make\u2019 may have the sense of constituting rather than\nproducing, in which case the reference to the virtues in the passage\nisn\u2019t action-guiding at all). Alternatively, he may think that what produces virtue is not the content of one\u2019s action, but the thoughts\nthat go along with it. But what thoughts are these? Surely, if virtue\nis to have any content, thinking \u2018only virtue is good\u2019 is\nnot going to be sufficient.\n",
