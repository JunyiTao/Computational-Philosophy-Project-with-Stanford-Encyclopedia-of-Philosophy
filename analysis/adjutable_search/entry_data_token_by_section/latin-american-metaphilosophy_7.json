    "main_text": "What Is Latin American Philosophy? || Middle-Way Theories\n3. The Issue of the Name\n\nA final note on the issue of the name: Latin American philosophers\nhave expressed a number of different preferences about what to call\nthe field. The standard name preferred here has been \u2018Latin\nAmerican philosophy.\u2019 But there are other options, depending on\nwhether \u2018thought\u2019 takes the place of\n\u2018philosophy,\u2019 and/or \u2018Iberoamerican,\u2019\n\u2018Hispanic,\u2019 \u2018Hispanic-American\u2019 or\n\u2018Latino/a\u2019 (among other qualifiers) takes the place of\n\u2018Latin American.\u2019 Keeping in mind that not all\nreplacements would be semantically equivalent (a topic revisited\nlater), note that the rationale for using \u2018thought\u2019 in\nlieu of \u2018philosophy\u2019 is to do justice to the breadth of\nphilosophical developments in Latin America\u2014which, as\nwe\u2019ve seen, includes a vast corpus of non-standard, non-academic\nphilosophical works. There is no common rationale for substituting any\nof the above qualifiers for \u2018Latin American.\u2019 But each\nproposed qualifier (including \u2018Latin American\u2019) inherits a\nproblem faced by the proper name from which it derives. The problem\nmay be semantic or pragmatic, where\n\nA semantic problem arises for the use of a term in the\nabsence of satisfactory criteria for determining its meaning or\nreference, and\nA pragmatic problem arises for the use of a term in the\npresence of morally, politically, or socially unacceptable\nconnotations associated with that term.\n\n\nAs an illustration, let\u2019s consider the term preferred here,\n\u2018Latin American philosophy.\u2019 Its qualifier derives from\n\u2018Latin America,\u2019 which appears to suffer from both types\nof problem. With few exceptions (e.g., Oliver 1998), those who have\nrecently reflected on this term go beyond geography and politics to\nconsider also factors such as culture and history in order to\ndetermine this term\u2019s meaning and reference. But it has proved\ndifficult to find criteria that avoid semantic problems such as\n\nThe term is too broad since \u2018Latin America,\u2019 when used\nliterally and directly, refers to certain people and territories which\nare not ordinarily taken to be Latin American (e.g., the\nQuebecois).\nThe term is too narrow since \u2018Latin America,\u2019 when\nused literally and directly, does not refer to peoples and\nterritories that are ordinarily taken to be Latin American (e.g., the\nindigenous peoples of Latin America).\nThe term is both too broad and too narrow since \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 faces both of the previous problems.\n\n\nJorge Gracia (2011a, p. 8) offers a way around these problems by\ntaking \u2018Latin America\u2019 to refer to \u201ceverything in\nthe Americas that is not American (U.S.) or Canadian.\u201d This\nextensional, negative criterion gets things right provided it assumes\na cultural understanding of \u2018American (U.S.)\u2019 and\n\u2018Canadian.\u2019 Without that assumption, the criterion would\nbe both too narrow and too broad, for it would exclude Puerto Rico,\nwhich is politically part of the U.S., and include St. Pierre and\nMiquelon, which are French islands off the coast of Canada. But Gracia\n(2011a, p. 8) seems to have in mind the relevant cultural\nunderstanding of the term, because he notes that \u201cthose parts of\nthe Caribbean and South America that were French, Dutch, or English\ncolonies, such as Haiti and Jamaica\u201d are not part of Latin\nAmerica (i.e., culturally understood).\n\nOn the other hand, Eduardo Rabossi (2003) explicitly provides a set of\nintensional criteria, which he appears to consider necessary and\nsufficient for falling under the reference of \u2018Latin\nAmerica.\u2019 According to them, the term denotes certain\n\u201cstates\u201d of North, Central, and South America by virtue of\ntheir sharing \u201ca common political origin (Spanish/Portuguese\nconquest), a similar linguistic heritage (Spanish/Portuguese), a\ndominant religion (Catholicism), and comparable predicaments vis\n\u00e0 vis local, regional, and international affairs\u201d\n(Rabossi 2003, p. 507). Rabossi\u2019s criteria, which are more\nrestrictive, avoid being too broad, but face the problem of being too\nnarrow, which makes them unsatisfactory.\n\nGuillermo Hurtado\u2019s (2010) reflection on the adequacy of the\nqualifier \u2018Latin American\u2019 illustrates the pragmatic\nproblem mentioned above. First, Hurtado too takes \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 to denote a culturally specific region of the Americas,\none individuated by appeal to language: viz., being a region of the\nAmericas that mostly speaks Spanish, Portuguese or French. Perhaps\naware of the problem of being too broad, Hurtado attempts to avoid it\nby excluding Quebec from the designation of \u2018Latin\nAmerica\u2019 on the seemingly ad hoc ground that the region\nis surrounded by mostly \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 Canada. In any case,\nhis account of \u2018Latin American\u2019 and \u2018the Latin\nAmerican\u2019 appears to point to a pragmatic problem arising from\nsome facts about those terms\u2019 introduction into public\ndiscourse. According to Hurtado, there is historical evidence that\nthey were introduced into public discourse in the late nineteenth\ncentury by the French, who did so in order to advance their national\ninterest in dealing with the Latin and Catholic nations of the\nAmericas (as opposed to the Protestant and \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019\nnations). Once these terms had caught on in thought and language,\ntheir role in discourse was unaffected by the defeat of the French in\nthe region, except for the fact that \u2018Latin America\u2019 came\ninstead to be just \u201can ideal of union among the nations\nthat compose it\u201d (Hurtado 2010, p. 11, my translation and\nemphasis). At the end of the day, however, Hurtado continues to use\nthese terms without explaining why we should do so, given that,\naccording to his own story, they were introduced for colonialist\npurposes\u2014and therefore face the pragmatic\n problem.[3]\n In addition, given this account, it would seem that those terms now\nrefer to nothing objective at all.\n\nBe that as it may, let\u2019s now consider some of the other options.\n\u2018Iberoamerican\u2019 and \u2018Hispanic American\u2019 are\nthe closest relatives of \u2018Latin American.\u2019 Neither of\nthese alternatives is problem free, since they inherit the pragmatic\nproblem facing the nouns from whence they derive, \u2018Iberia\u2019\nand \u2018Hispania.\u2019 Each of these ancient proper names\ndesignates the European peninsula today divided into Spain and\nPortugal. Thus, taken literally, each has connotations unacceptable to\nthe descendants of the victims of these countries\u2019 colonial\npolicies in the Americas.\n\nOn the other hand, \u2018Hispanic philosophy\u2019 and\n\u2018Latino/a philosophy\u2019 are more recent terms whose semantic\nfeatures are not yet fully settled by usage. Roughly, \u2018Hispanic\nphilosophy\u2019 may include Iberian philosophy too (Gracia 2000),\nwhile \u2018Latino/a philosophy\u2019 is the philosophy of or about\nthe descendants of Latin Americans abroad, especially in the United\nStates (Gracia 2011b). As noted above in the cases of\n\u2018Iberoamerican\u2019 and \u2018Hispanic American,\u2019 both\n\u2018Hispanic\u2019 and \u2018Latino/a\u2019 also appear to have\ninherited the pragmatic problem for the proper nouns from which each\nderives (it should now be obvious to the reader what those problems\nare).\n\nBut it may be that no such pragmatic problem matters after all for\njustifying the current use of \u2018Latin American\u2019 or some of\nthe alternative terms. That would be so if the reference of the proper\nname from which any such term derives is direct, in the sense that it\nis not mediated by the term\u2019s descriptive\n meaning.[4]\n On this account, the justification for using the term needs only\nappeal to linguistic convention.\n",
