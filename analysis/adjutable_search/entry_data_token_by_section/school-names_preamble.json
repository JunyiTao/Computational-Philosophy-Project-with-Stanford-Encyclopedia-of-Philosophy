    "main_text": "\n\nThe \u201cSchool of Names\u201d (ming jia) is the\ntraditional Chinese label for a diverse group of Warring States\n(479\u2013221 B.C.E.) thinkers who shared an interest in language,\ndisputation, and metaphysics. They were notorious for logic-chopping,\npurportedly idle conceptual puzzles, and paradoxes such as\n\u201cToday go to Yue but arrive yesterday\u201d and \u201cA white\nhorse is not a horse.\u201d Because reflection on language in ancient\nChina centered on \u201cnames\u201d (ming, words) and their\nrelation to \u201cstuff\u201d (shi, objects, events,\nsituations), 2nd-century B.C.E. Han dynasty archivists dubbed these\nthinkers the \u201cSchool of Names,\u201d one of six recognized\nphilosophical movements. The \u201cschool\u201d is a taxonomical\nfiction, however. The varied figures assigned to it\u2014Deng Xi, Yin\nWen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long, among others\u2014never formed a\ndistinct circle or movement devoted to any particular doctrine or way\nof life, and their intellectual interests overlapped extensively with\nthose of the later\n Mohists,\n Zhuangzi, and\n Xunzi.\n Several of these men were active politically: Hui Shi was a\ngovernment minister, Yin Wen and Gongsun Long political advisors and\npeace activists. Still, in the eyes of Han historians, they devoted\nthemselves to no signature ethical or political doctrines. Hence they\nbecame known primarily for their interest in language and disputation\nand on that basis were deemed a \u201cschool.\u201d \n\nBefore the Han dynasty, the social group of which these thinkers were\na part was known as the bian\nzhe\u2014\u201cdisputers\u201d or\n\u201cdialecticians\u201d\u2014because they spent much of their\ntime in \u201cdisputation\u201d (bian, also\n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d or \u201cdistinction drawing\u201d), a\nform of dialectical persuasion and inquiry aimed fundamentally at\n\u201cdistinguishing\u201d the proper semantic relations between\nnames and the things or kinds of things to which they refer.\n\u201cDisputers\u201d is thus probably a more appropriate English\nlabel for Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others than is the\n\u201cSchool of Names,\u201d though it refers not specifically to\nthese figures but to the broader class of scholars to which they\nbelonged. (\u201cName-distinguishers\u201d or\n\u201cdistinction-disputers\u201d would be even more accurate,\nthough these terms are too clumsy to adopt as English equivalents.)\nThe disputers flourished for about a century and a half as wandering\npolitical advisors, counseling rulers throughout pre-unification\nChina. They disappeared with the onset of the Qin dynasty (221\nB.C.E.), partly because the political and intellectual climate of the\nnew empire was hostile to their purely theoretical, occasionally\nflippant inquiries, and partly because with unification their\npolitical services became obsolete. \n",
