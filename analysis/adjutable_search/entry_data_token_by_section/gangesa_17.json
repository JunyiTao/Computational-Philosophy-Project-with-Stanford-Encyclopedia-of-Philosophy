    "main_text": "Testimony || The meaning of a statement\n7.2 The meaning of a statement\n\nIn the long chapter on testimony, one would expect speaker\ncertification conditions to be taken up, but they are not. Perhaps\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba sees them as satisfactorily elucidated by\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana on Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.7 along\nwith the later commentaries. In any case, the Jewel\u2019s\nfocus is on sentential conditions such as grammaticality and semantic\nfitness as remarked. Three conditions prominent in the grammatical\nliterature are addressed, \u201cexpectation,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101, \u201csemantic\nfit,\u201d yogyat\u0101, and \u201ccontiguity,\u201d\n\u0101satti. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba also takes up\nt\u0101tparya, \u201c(speaker\u2019s) intention,\u201d\ndisputing the views of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and championing\ncommon sense. Throughout the chapter, two views of sentence meaning\nare in view, (a) a \u201cBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\u201d radically\nreferentialist theory (due to Kum\u0101rila) that a word refers\nindependently of sentential context, and (b) a\n\u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101kara\u201d holistic view that has the sentence\nas a whole as informational, not words independently of sentential\ncontext. Although Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba endorses the\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view that a factual relation, not directly\nexpressed, accounts for sentential unity, often he frames a point\nusing the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara theory.\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana and company discuss word meaning in terms of\npossible referents (Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.59\u201369),\n(i) the individual, for example, \u2018cow\u2019 used for a\nparticular cow, (ii) the universal, cowhood, what all cows have in\ncommon, and (iii) \u201cshape,\u201d \u0101k\u1e5bti, as\nwith a cow-shaped pastry. The settled view is that all three are\ngenerally meant in a single usage, with predominance varying with\ncontext. Against this background, V\u0101caspati (1979) explores five\nviews of sentential meaning including both (a) the \u201ctheory of\nthe connection of the referents,\u201d the radically, incrementally\nreferentialist view espoused by Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das and\nNaiy\u0101yikas, abhihit\u00e2nvaya-v\u0101da, and (b) the\n\u201ctheory of reference of the connected,\u201d \u201cholistic\nreference,\u201d the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view of reference as\noccurring at the level of the sentence,\nanv\u012bt\u00e2bhidh\u0101na-v\u0101da. In his\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra work (1996), V\u0101caspati imports the\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view, according to which sentence meaning is\nderivative from the reference of individual words and other semantic\nelements taken together, with the overall connection, anvaya,\nprovided by the fact (if the statement is true) of the words\u2019\nreferents being in relation, the \u201ctruth-maker.\u201d Later\nNaiy\u0101yikas such as Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follow him, although, to\nrepeat, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba often talks about sentential unity\npresupposing the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view that the component words do\nnot individually have referential power but only as connected\ngrammatically, with a complex object or fact as that which is referred\nto by the unifying sentence.\n\n\u201cExpectation,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101, \u201c(verbal)\nexpectation,\u201d is the first of three sentential conditions taken\nup. After rejecting four attempts to define the phenomenon in its\nrelevance for the epistemology of testimony, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nendorses the following (2020: 1259):\n\n\nExpectation amounts to incompleteness of reference, specifically, an\nincompleteness of \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(X\\); that is to say, without\n\\(Y\\) there would be, with respect to \\(X\\), no generation of\nawareness of an overall connection among the meanings of words and\nother factors taken in their native senses. Words (and other semantic\nunits) used as nouns, case endings, verbal roots, verbal endings,\nfinite verbs, and words in declension are such that, in a particular\ninstance, without the one or the other, there would not be awareness\ngenerated of an overall connection among all the referents mutually,\ntaking everything in its native sense.\n\n\nLists of words do not fulfill the \u201cexpectation\u201d condition,\nfor example, \u201cCow, being-the-object-of-an-action (as designated\nby a word in the accusative case), bringing.\u201d Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nadmits that it \u201ccould be an instance of knowledge of verbal\nmeaning, but it would not produce knowledge of an overall\nconnection\u201d (2020: 1547). Nevertheless, with him the expectation\nis also something felt by a hearer, whose grasping the\nreference of one word with its case ending (which also refers,\naccording to him) leads to expectation not just of another word but of\nits referent. Thus expectation is a psychological property mediated by\nwords in reference to a fact. It is embedded in a subject\u2019s\nunderstanding of words as united by their references comprising the\nfact that is captured by a statement. Sometimes\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s dialectic, particularly in several sections\non verbal compounds and the like at the end of the chapter, trades on\nthe difficulty of finding a factual item to which a word would\ncorrespond in its real-world relationality as implicated in the\nincorporation of the word grammatically into a declarative sentence.\nThus while the \u201cexpectation\u201d seems to work as a matter of\ngrammar, the \u201cgrammar\u201d is thought to reflect a fact that\nthe words pick out.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba often refers to the problem of the word list that\nis not unified, several times appearing to reinstate a grammatical\nunderstanding of \u201cexpectation\u201d as opposed to how\nobjects\u2014referents\u2014are related in fact. And once (2020:\n1547) this comes right at the heart of his endorsement of\n\u201cincremental referentialism\u201d as opposed to the\nconnectivist, \u201cholistic\u201d variety of the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara. He says, \u201c \u2026 a word endowed with\nexpectation and meeting the other requirements is what brings about a\nparticular presentation of an overall connection.\u201d This seems to\nbe the answer to the problem of the list whose items do not show\ngrammatical connections although they are just what the things\nthemselves demand to constitute a fact, a truth-maker: \u201cPot,\nbeing-the-object-of-an-action (as designated by the accusative case),\nbringing, action.\u201d The endings on the words in the list do not\nrefer to relations that connect up the other things properly. This is\nthe difference. Each item listed appears incomplete because, for\nexample, reference to bringing demands not only the meaning of a word\nas something that could be brought but a word in the accusative case\nwith the case ending indicating that it is in the right kind of\nrelation objectively. Every base word is by itself\n\u201cunsaturated,\u201d to use the Fregean term, referring to\nsomething in the world that has to hook up with something else\nreferred to, if there is to be a sentence and statement,\nabhihit\u00e2nvaya.\n\nIn addition to a section devoted to a second sentential condition,\n\u201csemantic fit,\u201d yogyat\u0101, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nprovides a brief definition in other places in part because its\nviolation is commonly taken to be the trigger to take a word in a\nsecondary way, not directing us to a \u201cnative\u201d referent (he\nalso advances a slightly different view of the trigger which\nwe\u2019ll review later). For example (2020: 1228):\n\n\nSemantic fit (yogyat\u0101) amounts to there being no\nlegitimate block to understanding a statement.\n\n\nIncluded in this is the \u201cGettier case\u201d of a parrot\u2019s\nsaying something that a hearer \\(H\\) would take as true if \\(H\\) did\nnot know the sounds were from a parrot. In the scenario, \\(H\\) fails\nto put together the sounds as words and as a sentence and does not\nacquire testimonial knowledge. Knowing that the sounds are from a\nparrot is a block. The yogyat\u0101 condition is defined\nnegatively and is commonly invoked as a kind a coherence check. And\nhere Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba concurs.\n\nHe resists, however, the application of the principle to a Vedic\ninjunction to perform a sacrifice whose result is supposed to be in\nthe distant future, going to heaven, say, which wouldn\u2019t make\nsense, the ritualists reason, without elliptical reference to\nap\u016brva, a magical \u201cUnseen Force,\u201d\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, that connects the completion of the\nsacrifice with its goal. According to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, no\nap\u016brva is thereby referenced (etymologically that which\nis \u201cnot understood before\u201d comprehension of an injunction\nas applying to oneself, say M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas) and if there\nis \u201cUnseen Force\u201d created by a sacrifice or another good\nwork it, like all karma, inheres in the self of the performer,\naffecting, in particular, his or her next incarnation. Thus again he\nendorses a doctrine of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, which also\nrejects ap\u016brva but accepts karma as popularly\nunderstood.\n\nThe Jewel\u2019s section on \u201ccontiguity\u201d is\nshort, and special topics such as ellipsis, etymology versus\nreconventionalization (only lotuses are referred to in Sanskrit by the\ncompound \u2018pa\u1e45ka-ja\u2019,\n\u201cmud-born,\u201d although plants like the water-lily are also\nborn in mud), homonymy, and others are treated more or less briefly.\nBut the topic of injuction looms large in the chapter overall along\nwith a concern with M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka views of moral authority\nas fundamenally a matter of Vedic injunction.\n\nInjunctions are commonly formed in Sanskrit through use of the\noptative verbal form, and a central question is just what does the\noptative affix mean. That one should do such and such seems to be the\ncore meaning about which everyone agrees, but different analyses are\ngiven of the idea that one should do such and such. A central thesis\nis that a certain kind of knowledge both prompts and guides any action\nthat is voluntary, prav\u1e5btti, whether in everyday life\nor with a ritual. So now since rituals are actions, some of these\naction-prompting thoughts are prompted by comprehending Vedic\nsentences. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s effort is often directed to\nintegrating our understanding of Vedic and everyday language, and he\nuses his criticisms of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 analyses of ritual\nactions to illumine the voluntary in general along with \u201cdesire\nto do,\u201d effort, and the knowledge that directs action,\nincluding, especially, knowledge of a \u201cmeans to what\u2019s\nwanted,\u201d i\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101dhanat\u0101, an idea\nhotly debated by all factions of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. A basic\ndivision in the school occurs on the issue whether means of\naccomplishing what is enjoined, or contemplated because desired,\ni\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101dhanat\u0101, is part of the content\nof an injunction (as itself implicated in any \u201cdesire to\ndo\u201d as the desire\u2019s cognitive content).\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das insist that it is, but Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas\ndemur, claiming that such is known by a separate intellectual act of\n\u201cpresumption,\u201d arth\u00e2patti. For\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas, it is simply that something \u201cought to be\ndone,\u201d its k\u0101ryat\u0101, that is the meaning of an\ninjunction, with the means to what\u2019s wanted known by\npresumption. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba rehearses extensive arguments on both\nsides, and seems generally to favor the positions of the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas.\n\nIn the end, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba champions an understanding of the\ninjunction as expressing a certain kind of knowledge-prompting action,\nespecially \u201cwhat one ought to do,\u201d\nk\u0101ryat\u0101, which he sees, agreeing with the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara, as the meaning of an injunction. That is to say,\nfor him, \u201cwhat one ought to do\u201d is the meaning in part.\nBut he also agrees with the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da that a means has\nto be known or made known, and he adds another factor, effort, and the\nrequirement that the action be known as accomplishable by one\u2019s\nown effort.\n\nAn ethical view centered on Vedic injunctions is embedded in\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka attitudes, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba shows\nsympathy for the life regulated by ritual, in particular daily rituals\nthat require no special qualifications. But his own ethical outlook is\nnowhere explicitly stated. At places he shows affinity for a\nsoteriological ethics implicit in a mystical way of knowing the\n\u201ctruth\u201d concerning the \u201cself,\u201d\n\u0101tman, a self as experienced in a special kind of yogic\nmeditation. At several places, he quotes the Bhagavad\nG\u012bt\u0101, apparently endorsing its karma-yoga teaching of\nbenevolent action. Despite sympathy for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\npositions, when it comes to the striking and longlasting conflicts,\nethical and otherwise, between ritualists and mystics/yogins in the\nsubcontinent, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba seems to line up with the\nyogins\u2014like, it should be noted, Gautama, the author of the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra and his commentators. Indeed, although\nairing M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 opinion apparently with much\nsympathy, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees injunctions to perform rituals as\ntrumped by yogic teachings of the way to self-discovery. But also like\nmany Naiy\u0101yikas before him, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba appears to try to\nfind middle ground in ethics as in other areas of theory. Surely, he\nis not a radical critic of the ritualists\u2019 moral codes, more\nlikely one of their number trying to nudge colleagues into broader\npoints of view.\n",
