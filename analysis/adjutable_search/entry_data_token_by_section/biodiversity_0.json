Pre-History of \u201cBiodiversity\u201d: Variety and Its Values\n\nThe term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d was coined around 1985, but the\nconceptual, and political, foundations for the new term were developed\nover at least the previous decade. The link between biotic diversity\nand human well-being is clear in the \u201cpre-history\u201d of the\nterm \u201cbiodiversity\u201d (roughly, the history of the term\nbefore it was invented). Much of the early work recognising a species\nextinction crisis naturally focussed on the values of individual\nspecies to humanity, in addition to their intrinsic value (for\nreviews, see Farnham 2007; Mazur & Lee 1993). Discussions by Myers\n(1976) and others broadened this focus to include a concern about the\nconsequent overall loss of variety, and why such a loss of variety\nitself matters to humanity. Haskins (1974: 646) summarised an\nimportant discussion meeting where participants called for\n\n\nan Ethic of Biotic Diversity in which such diversity is viewed as a\nvalue in itself and is tied in with the survival and fitness of the\nhuman race.\n\n\nHaskins (1974: 646) argued, \u201cPlants and animals that may now be\nregarded as dispensable may one day emerge as valuable\nresources\u201d and that extinction \u201cthreatens to narrow down\nfuture choices for mankind\u201d (see also Anonymous 1974).\nSimilarly, Roush (1977: 9) argued that \u201cdiversity increases the\npossibility of future benefits\u201d (for review, see Farnham\n2007).\n\nMyers (1976) arguments for a greater focus on the overall loss of\nvariety appeared in his paper, \u201cAn Expanded Approach to the\nProblem of Disappearing Species\u201d. He argued that\n\n\n\u2026the spectrum of species can be reckoned a repository of some\nof society\u2019s most valuable raw materials. Moreover, loss of\nspecies will affect generations into the indefinite future, whose\noptions to utilize species in ways yet undetermined should be kept\nopen. (see also Josephson 1982)\n\n\nMyers and Ayensu (1983) similarly argued that the possible discovery\nof benefits for humans is a primary justification for conservation of\nbiological diversity (see also Myers\u2019 1979 book, The Sinking\nArk).\n\nThis pre-history considered variety at more than the species level.\nFarnham (2017) provides a useful historical perspective, describing\nhow the standard three levels of variation later recognised by the\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\u2014genes, species, and\necosystems\u2014became established early as parts of our broader\nconcern about the loss of living variation. He describes this as a\nconvergence of separate concerns about species loss, loss of genetic\nvariety, and the disappearance of ecosystem types. Other support for\nthis convergence is found in early work referring to the variety of\nbiomes or ecosystems as capturing variety at the species level. For\nexample, Ehrenfeld (1970) referred to the potential but unknown uses\nof species and suggested conserving the full variety of ecosystems to\ncapture these future options (arguing that every ecosystem is likely\nto have some useful species). Back in 1972, the botanist, H. H. Iltis,\nargued that we must \u201cpreserve sufficient diversity of species\nand of ecosystems\u201d because \u201cwe will never reach a point\nwhere we shall know which organisms are going to be of value to man\nand which are not\u201d (Iltis 1972: 204). Ehrenfeld referred to the\nneed globally to conserve a representative set of the different\necosystems (see also Roush 1977). Echoing these concerns, Wilson\n(1984) later lamented the lack of representativeness of the variety of\necosystems in the current protected areas system.\n\nThus, while important early discussion (Lovejoy 1980) linked\n\u201cbiological diversity\u201d to species richness, the full\nspectrum of the early work reveals precedents for considering multiple\nlevels\u2014all with conceptual links to the species extinction\ncrisis.\n",
