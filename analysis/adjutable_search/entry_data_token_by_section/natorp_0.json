    "main_text": "Natorp and Marburg neo-Kantianism\n1. Natorp and Marburg neo-Kantianism\n\nNeo-Kantianism, it is often said, was the dominant current of late\nnineteenth-century German academic philosophy. While true, this\nstatement is uninformative, since the label conveys no clear doctrinal\ncontent. Given the widespread perception that philosophy had become\ndiscredited by the untenable claims of the German Idealists, the\nvarious neo-Kantian schools shared a conviction that Kant\u2014on\nsome interpretation of his sobriety\u2014could give philosophy a\nrespectable and genuine task again, now that it had awakened from its\nlong post-Hegelian hangover (cf. Natorp 1918a: 4\u20136; Dussort\n1963; Schn\u00e4delbach 1983a, 1983b; K\u00f6hnke 1986; Philonenko 1989; Sluga 1976: 28). The\nlabel therefore does not necessarily signify a revival of Kant\u2019s\ndoctrines (much less of Kant-scholarship for its own\n sake[6]\n ), but rather, as Natorp himself puts it, philosophizing in the\nspirit of Kant (Natorp 1918a: 7). But what does that mean? For the\nMarburg School, Kant\u2019s great idea, \u201cthe central notion\nwith respect to which one must relate, understand, and evaluate\neverything else in Kant\u201d is the transcendental method\n(Natorp 1912c: 194; cf. Cassirer 1925: 288). This method constitutes\n\u201cthe unshakeable guideline of our whole philosophizing\u201d\n(Natorp 1912c: 196). Why? Because the transcendental method anchors\nphilosophy in facts (eminently the fact of mathematical physics),\nof which philosophy is to establish the conditions of\npossibility or justification (Rechtsgrund) (Natorp 1912c:\n197; 196). By limiting itself to this task of justification,\nphilosophical reason keeps itself from ascending into the aether of\nspeculation. At the same time, by discovering the source of scientific\nobjectivity (and thus of rational objectivity generally), i.e., by\n\u201cclearly exhibiting the law [of objectivity] in its\npurity\u201d, philosophy \u201csecures science [and rational\nactivity generally] in its autonomy and preserves it from alien\ndistraction\u201d (Natorp 1912c: 197\u2013198). Transcendental\nphilosophy in the Kantian spirit, then, is doubly\n\u201ccritical\u201d, checking itself against metaphysical excesses,\non the one hand, but also rigorously formulating the ideal grounds of\nthe sciences, on the other (Natorp 1912c: 198; cf. Poma 1997, ch. 3,\n4). At the same time, the Marburg School finds in the critical\nphilosophy an idealistic bulwark against the empiricism epitomized by\nMill.\n\nMoreover, the Marburgers endorsed Kant\u2019s view that philosophy\nshould adopt an approach to the other domains of human\nculture\u2014morality, art, and religion\u2014that was\n\u201ccritical\u201d in just the transcendental sense described\nabove. This approach, then, takes the critique of science as the\nparadigm of philosophy\u2019s relation to culture in general. Just as\nthe critical theory of science begins from the concrete theories\ndeveloped by the special sciences, so philosophy in general should\nbegin from the achievements of culture (e.g., works of art, moral\naction or institutions), and investigate the basis of their claims.\nThis is one reason Cohen and Natorp call their critical philosophy\n\u201cidealism\u201d, because its task vis-\u00e0-vis culture is\nto lay out the system of rational principles that make possible the\n\u201cfacts\u201d of science, morality, and art. At the same time,\ntheir idealism aims at making explicit the \u201cideas\u201d that\nguide, or ought to guide, the continuous development of culture.\nFinally, the Marburgers\u2019 very theory of transcendental\nprinciples is itself \u201cidealistic\u201d in the radical sense\nthat all objects of experience are held to be the products solely of\nthe activity of thinking. Nevertheless, Marburg theory denies\nphilosophy any \u201cspeculative\u201d task of seeing or knowing\nthings that are beyond experience, of constructing systems of ideas\nthat are not immanent in the facts of human knowledge, action, or\nproduction. Like Cassirer, Natorp makes this view of philosophy in the\nKantian spirit the basis of his own philosophy of science and of his\nhistorical interpretations.\n\nOne main reason why neo-Kantians of all stripes see the essence of\nphilosophy in critique is that it guarantees philosophy\u2019s\nautonomy (cf. Natorp 1887: 266\u2013269, 285, et passim). Of\nall rational activities, philosophy alone has the task of discovering\nthe conditions and regulative ideals that make such activities at all\npossible. While the problem of philosophy\u2019s identity as a\ndiscipline of course goes back to Plato, we are faced, in the\nnineteenth-century German context, with the particular problem of\nphilosophy\u2019s relation to the positive sciences, which had\ncompletely repudiated and replaced the knowledge-claims of the\nspeculative systems of German Idealism. For the Marburgers, the issue\nof philosophy\u2019s disciplinary integrity becomes intertwined with\nthe question of the autonomy of reason itself. Cohen and Natorp faced\na difficult task. Having turned their backs on speculative philosophy,\nthey could not define reason\u2019s autonomy by falling back upon the\ndiscredited Geist of German\n Idealism.[7]\n But they also could not let reason (or as they prefer to call it,\n\u201cthinking\u201d) be conceived as a set of psychological\noperations, since that would subject reason\u2019s laws (logic) to\nmore basic psychological or psychophysical laws. Already in his\n(1887), Natorp objects to such psychologism (though he does not use\nthe term) on the grounds that science and knowledge, and the very\nnotion of objective truth these presuppose, would be rendered\nsenseless if grounded in the subjective experience of the\nthinking or knowing psyche (see esp.\n Section 4).\n The chief task for any account of Natorp\u2019s philosophy, then, is\nto make sense of his notion of rational autonomy.\n\nBeyond the issue of reason\u2019s autonomy or priority, another\ncentral issue for Natorp is reason\u2019s history; again, this is a\nconcern typical of the Marburg School generally; one of its\npeculiarities is the quasi-Hegelian insistence upon the integration of\nthe systematic and historical moments of philosophy. Cohen wrote major\nessays on Plato (Cohen 1866, 1878), and Natorp\u2019s early work\nconcentrated on what the Marburgers considered ancient and early\nmodern anticipations of the critical philosophy. Then there is\nNatorp\u2019s magnum opus, Platos Ideenlehre of\n1903, in which he simultaneously develops a \u201ccritical\u201d\ninterpretation of the theory of forms and an argument for the order of\nthe dialogues, all conceived as an \u201cIntroduction to\nIdealism\u201d (cf. Laks 1994, 2003).\n\nDuring his life, Paul Natorp was overshadowed by his mentor, Cohen,\nand after his death, by the more glamorous Cassirer. For decades, if\nhe was mentioned at all, one remembered his controversial Plato book,\nor, perhaps, his other contributions to the study of Greek thought\n(cf., e.g., Stewart 1909; Owens 1978; Gaiser 1969). But Natorp has\nbeen further obscured by the general eclipse of neo-Kantianism for\nmost of the twentieth\n century.[8]\n It has only been since the late 1970\u2019s, with the revival of\nEuropean interest in the Marburg School, and especially through the\nwork of Helmut Holzhey since the\n 1980\u2019s,[9]\n that Natorp has reappeared on the philosophical scene and the unique\nfeatures of his thought have become more plainly distinguished from\n Cohen\u2019s.[10]\n Holzhey\u2019s unearthing of several heterodox, critical texts\n(Holzhey 1986: vol. 2) from the Nachlass suggests that Natorp\nhimself had suppressed them, either \u201cfor the sake of maintaining\nthe unity of the \u2018Marburg School,\u2019\u201d or because he\ndid not always think himself able to provide an alternative to a\nparticular Cohenian\n thesis.[11]\n Yet, despite the Marburgers\u2019 loud assertion of the centrality\nto their philosophy of science and its history, most recent interest\nin Cohen has focused on his late works in the philosophy of religion;\nand despite Natorp\u2019s allegiance to Cohen\u2019s generally\nscientistic program, much ado is made of his purported\n\u201contological turn\u201d (cf., e.g., Brach 1996: 190, ff.;\nStolzenberg 1995, ch. 5) away from epistemology. By contrast, this\narticle focuses on Natorp\u2019s thought in the areas to which he\nafter all devoted most of his career as a member of the Marburg\nSchool: philosophy of science, history of philosophy, and\nphilosophical psychology; it does not deal with his politics or\npedagogical theories (see esp. Willey 1978; Jegelka 1992; Natorp\n1905), philosophically informed though they are (Cohen 1914: 470).\n",
