    "main_text": "Writings\n3. Writings\n\n\nAutrecourt\u2019s oeuvre is not large. There is a correspondence with the\nFranciscan theologian Bernard of Arezzo, and with a certain Master\nGiles (possibly Giles of Feno), and a treatise that has come to be\nknown as the Exigit ordo. Furthermore, we have a theological\nquestion dealing with the intension and remission of forms and the\nproblem of minima and maxima (utrum visio alicuius rei naturalis\npossit naturali intendi [Could the vision of any natural thing be\nnaturally intensified?]).\n\n\nAutrecourt wrote nine letters to Bernard of Arezzo, only two of\nwhich survive. In addition, there is one letter from master Giles\naddressed to Autrecourt, along with a brief response by the latter,\nwhich, however, breaks off in mid-sentence. The correspondence has been\npreserved in two manuscript copies from the intellectual milieu of the\nColl\u00e8ge de Sorbonne. Together the letters form a small dossier,\nthe central item of which is the letter from Master Giles. Apparently,\nthe only reason the two letters to Bernard were copied was because they\nare mentioned in the letter from Master Giles. The correspondence\nbetween Autrecourt and Bernard of Arezzo is much earlier, dating from\nthe time when both were theology students, engaged as opponents in each\nother\u2019s Principia, i.e., inaugural lecture on the\nSentences. They can be dated between October 1335 and June\n1336, although both Principia are now lost. There is no\nevidence that Autrecourt ever actually wrote a commentary on the\nSentences, which, in any case was not a formal requirement for\nobtaining a degree. The theme of the discussion in the\nPrincipia and the letters to Bernard of Arezzo is the validity\nof Aristotle\u2019s principle of non-contradiction, as presented in Book IV\nof the Metaphysics.\n\n\nThe Exigit ordo is the fruit of Autrecourt\u2019s teaching in the\narts faculty. In the first of its two prologues, it is addressed to\nthe reverendi patres, i.e. to the theologians in religious\norders. Instead of expounding his views in commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\ntexts, Autrecourt chose to write an independent treatise discussing\nissues pertaining to natural philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology,\nphilosophical psychology, and ethics, and engaging in debate with\nunnamed contemporaries. The work is not a neat sequence of chapters or\nquestions with pro and con arguments. It has been suggested that the\nExigit was a draft version in which Autrecourt had penned\nideas, arguments and fragments of disputations that were awaiting\ntheir final ordering. The work was completed in the years 1333\u201335, at\nwhich time Autrecourt was preparing his commentary on the\nSentences. For financial reasons, Autrecourt taught in the\narts faculty while he was enrolled as a student in theology. Possibly,\nhe even wrote the Exigit after he commented on the\nSentences, but before 1340, when he was summoned to\nAvignon.\n\n\nThe Exigit ordo is also known as the Tractatus\nuniversalis (Universal Treatise). The latter title is actually a\nmisreading of the first two words of the treatise, \u201ctractatus\nutilis\u201d (useful treatise). It has been preserved in a single\nmanuscript copy, which, like the Giles letter, breaks off in\nmid-sentence. It is divided into two prologues, two treatises, and\nseveral chapters, which, unfortunately, the scribe has placed in the\nwrong order. The Latin edition and English translation both preserve\nthe order of the medieval manuscript without correction.\n\n\nThe theological question is a report (reportatio) of a\ntheological disputation in which Autrecourt served as respondent to\nthe objections. Although the presiding master of a disputation would\nusually have to be considered its real author, matters may be\ndifferent here. Since it is a reportatio \u2014 i.e., a text\nwhich, unlike an ordinatio, was not subjected to later\nediting by the master himself \u2014 Autrecourt\u2019s views probably\nappear in unadulterated form.  The question was disputed between\n1336\u201339, and has been little studied by scholars.\n",
