    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || The Existence of God\n7.2 Optimism\n\n\nLeibniz's account of the nature of possible worlds is dealt\nwith in a separate entry. Here the following simple question will be\naddressed: How can this world be the best of all possible worlds? After\nall, as Voltaire brought out so clearly in Candide, it\ncertainly seems that this world, in which one finds no short supply of\nnatural and moral horrors, is far from perfect \u2013 indeed, it seems\npretty lousy. Certainly only a fool could believe that it is the best\nworld possible. But, Leibniz speaks on behalf of the fool, with an\nargument that has essentially the following structure:\n\n\n\n(1)\nGod is omnipotent and omniscient\nand benevolent and the free creator of the world. (Definition)\n\n\n(2)\nThings could have been otherwise\u2013i.e., there are other\npossible worlds. (Premise)\n\n\n(3)\nSuppose this world is not the best of\nall possible worlds. (I.e., \u201cThe world could be\nbetter.\u201d)\n\n\n(4)\nIf this world is not the best of all possible\nworlds, then at least one of the following must be the case:\n\n \nGod was not powerful enough to bring about a better world;\nor\nGod did not know how this world would develop after his creation\nof it (i.e. God lacked foreknowledge); or\nGod did not wish this world to be the best; or\nGod did not create the world; or\nthere were no other possible worlds from which God could\nchoose.\n\n\n\n\n(5)\nBut, any one or more of the disjuncts of (4) contradicts\n(1) or (2).\n\n\n(6)\nTherefore, this world is the best of all\npossible worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, Leibniz seems to argue that, if one is to hold the\ntraditional theistic conception of God and believe that one\ncan meaningfully assert that the world could have been other than it\nis, then one must hold that this world is the best possible.\nNaturally, this argument is simply the Christian retort to the\nEpicurean argument against theism.\n\n\nBut what are the criteria by which one can say that this world is\nthe best? It should be clear that Leibniz nowhere says that\nthis argument implies that everything has to be wonderful. Indeed,\nLeibniz is squarely in the tradition of all Christian apologists going\nback to Augustine, arguing that we cannot have knowledge of the whole\nof the world and that even if a piece of the mosaic that is\ndiscoverable to us is ugly the whole may indeed have great beauty.\nStill, Leibniz does offer at least two considerations relevant to the\ndetermination of the happiness and perfection of the world. He tells us\nin the Discourse on Metaphysics, first, that\n\u201c\u2026the happiness of minds is the principal aim of\nGod\u2026\u201d (A VI iv 1537/AG 38) and, second, that \u201cGod\nhas chosen the most perfect world, that is, the one which is at the\nsame time the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in\nphenomena\u201d (A VI iv 1538/AG 39). So, is this world of genocide\nand natural disaster better than a world containing only one\nmultifoliate rose? Yes, because the former is a world in which an\ninfinity of minds perceive and reflect on the diversity of phenomena\ncaused by a modest number of simple laws. To the more difficult\nquestion whether there is a better world with perhaps a little less\ngenocide and natural disaster Leibniz can only respond that, if so, God\nwould have brought it into actuality. And this, of course, is to say\nthat there really is no better possible world.\n",
