    "main_text": "Religion and Postsecularism\n7. Religion and Postsecularism\n\nHabermas\u2019s views about religion and its place in modern society\nhave changed strikingly over the course of his career. In a series of\ntexts written mostly after 2001 he revises the secularist bent of his\nearlier social and political theory, as expressed in Theory of\nCommunicative Action and Between Facts and Norms, so as\nto acknowledge religion\u2019s close relation to philosophy and the\ncentral place of religious believers in democratic states.\n\nInfluenced by Weber and Durkheim, Habermas had earlier characterised\nreligious beliefs as the worldviews of traditional societies that in\nthe course of rationalisation are superseded and replaced by secular\nforms. In religious belief the validity claims of objective truth,\nmoral rightness, and sincerity, and along with them the objective,\nintersubjective, and subjective world-relations, were fused together.\nSpeakers could not thematize and contest them (1981 [1984a: 214]; 1981\n[1987: 189]). This fusion, maintained by the strict segregation of\nsacred from profane domains of life, enabled a normative consensus to\ncrystallize by non-discursive means (1981 [1987: 54]). That which was\nin accord with society\u2019s ritually protected normative consensus\nwas right, that which violated it was wrong, and the consensus itself\nwas beyond questioning. The transition to modernity begins with the\n\u201clinguistification of the sacred\u201d, in which \u201cthe\nauthority of the holy is gradually replaced by the authority of an\nachieved consensus\u201d (1981 [1987: 77, see also 288]). Normative\nconsensus and social integration are achieved in modern societies\nthrough communicative action, carried out by competent speaking and\nacting subjects who have mastered all three validity claims and\nworld-relations (1981 [1987: 107, 145]). The sacred, the lynchpin of\nreligious worldviews, has dissolved into unrestricted discourse, in\nwhich any validity claim may be contested. Religious belief may\ncontinue to exist, but it is now one worldview among many, and like\nevery other social practice it must be continued by means of\ncommunicative action (1981 [1987: 88\u20139]).\n\nHabermas at this stage saw post-traditional society as secular (1992b\n[1996b: 443\u20134]). He subsequently rejected this view, stating\nthat\n\n\nMy earlier Hegelian view of religion as a formation destined to be\ndialectically superseded in the modern world has indeed changed. The\nempirical evidence of the survival of religion under modern conditions\nhas accumulated in recent decades. (2012 chapter 6 [2017: 143])\n\n\nHis most recent work paints a very different picture of the role of\nritual and the sacred (2012 chapter 3 [2017]), revising many of his\ncentral claims in the Theory of Communicative Action. Aside\nfrom these revisions to his social theory, Habermas\u2019s\npostsecular writings address the philosophical theme of the\nrelationship between religious faith and philosophical reason\n (\u00a77.1)\n as well as the political theme of religion\u2019s place within\ndeliberative democracy\n (\u00a77.2).\n",
