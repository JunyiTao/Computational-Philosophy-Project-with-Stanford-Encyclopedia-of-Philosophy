    "main_text": "The intellectual milieu\n2. The intellectual milieu\n\nScholars are apt to speak casually of Origen\u2019s Platonism, more\ntechnically of his \u201cmiddle\u201d Platonism, most commonly, and\nnot often with conscious paradox, of his Christian Platonism. The\nLutheran theologian Anders Nygren (1953), who protested that a\nChristian Platonist is not a Christian, differed only in his judgment\nof the facts, not in his reading of them, from his critics J.M. Rist\n(1964) and Catherine Osborne (1994), who maintained that Platonism in\nOrigen\u2019s hands was not so much an adulteration as a salutary\nrefinement of the gospel. Nevertheless, whatever the merits of\nNygren\u2019s theology, Origen would have agreed with him in the\nmatter of nomenclature. The majority of his explicit references to\nPlato are to be found in the work Against Celsus, a reply to\na dead polemicist who is nowadays characterized as a middle Platonist,\nthough Origen hints that he may have been an Epicurean (Against\nCelsus 1.8; see further Bergjan 2001). Origen undertakes to show\nthat the simplest disciple of God\u2019s word knows him better than\nthe philosophers who seek him by their own methods (Against\nCelsus 7.42), that Plato misrepresents the fall and diminishes\nthe Creator, that if his myths are deep, the biblical allegories are\ndeeper and less perverse, and that Numenius, the foremost Platonist of\nrecent times, has spoken of both Moses and Jesus with esteem\n(Against Celsus 4.51 etc.).\n\nThe Bible (consisting for Origen only of the New Testament and the\nSeptuagint) is the matrix of every argument in this as in all his\nwritings; while it would be naive, and a contradiction of his own\npractice, to deny that his exegesis was conditioned by philosophical\nassumptions, the propaedeutic to biblical study in his school at\nCaesarea was not Platonism but a professedly unprejudiced survey of\nall the Greek schools. We learn this from his pupil Gregory\nThaumaturgus (Panegyric 13.151\u2013152), to whom he also\nwrote a letter assigning to Greek thought an ancillary role in the\nelucidation of the scriptures; while he was less inclined than his\npredecessors to accuse the Greeks of plagiarizing their philosophical\nviews from the books of Moses, he held that, since every exercise of\nreason is inspired by Christ the Logos, a Christian has as much right\nto the tools of pagan philosophy as the Israelites had to reimburse\ntheir labour from the \u201cspoils of the Egyptians\u201d\n(Philokalia 13; see further Martens 2012: 29\u201333).\nTheologians have at last begun to take Origen at his word as an\ninterpreter of the scriptures; this is not to say that all other\ninfluences are ignored, but that he is thought to deserve the same\ncourtesy that Classicists show to Plotinus when they acknowledge that\neven doctrines which he consciously shares with the Stoics or\nAristotle can be derived without subterfuge from the text of\nPlato.\n\nThe epithet \u201cPlatonist\u201d will of course be warranted if\nOrigen the Christian is identified with the Origen whom Porphyry\nrepresents as one of the privileged disciples of Ammonius Saccas, the\nAlexandrian teacher of Plotinus. According to Porphyry (Life of\nPlotinus 3.20\u201338) this Origen swore an oath with Plotinus\nand a third disciple, Herennius, not to reveal the esoteric doctrines\nof Ammonius after the latter\u2019s death in 243 A.D. This story\nimplies both personal intimacy and geographical proximity, yet Origen\nthe Christian was at this time almost sixty (twenty years senior to\nPlotinus), had left Alexandria for Caesarea some years before, and\nalready had a multitude of books to his name as a Christian teacher.\nPorphyry does not allude to these lucubrations in his Life of\nPlotinus, but says that the Origen he refers to breached the pact\nby issuing first a treatise On Daemons, then another, with\nthe title That the King is the Only Maker, in the reign of\nGallienus (253\u2013268). He includes in the Life a letter,\nwritten in 262 or 263 by his former tutor Longinus, which ascribes to\nOrigen only the work On Daemons (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 20.36\u201345). All scholars agree that Origen the\nChristian could not have written anything in the last years of\nGallienus; if we can trust Eusebius, he did not live to see this reign\nat all, but died in that of Gallienus\u2019 predecessor Gallus\n(251\u2013253). So, if this Origen is our author, Porphyry must at\nleast have misstated the period at which he violated the agreement.\nThose who contend that there was only one Origen reply that it is the\nchronology of Eusebius that must be flawed because, although his\naccount of Origen\u2019s youth implies that he was born in 185, he\nasserts that his death occurred in his seventieth year, and hence not\nearlier than 254, the first year of Gallienus. The same apologists\nargue that Porphyry fails to mention his Christian writings either\nbecause he despised them or (more cogently) because the publication of\nthem did not violate the oath (cf. Ramelli 2009). If this argument is\nto prevail, a reason must also be furnished for the silence of\nLonginus on this part of Origen\u2019s work, the Christian works of\nOrigen must be regarded as aids (in some degree) to the reconstruction\nof the teaching of Ammonius, and something must be said to explain the\nfailure of Origen\u2019s Christian detractors in late antiquity to\ncite the two works\u2014still extant, according to\nProclus\u2014which he added to the Neoplatonic canon. For these\nreasons, while theologians have often maintained, or simply assumed,\nthe identity of the two Origens, the author of the article on Origen\nin the Oxford Classical Dictionary asserts that the contrary\nposition is nowadays the more widely held (Smith 2012; see further\nEdwards 1993). \n",
