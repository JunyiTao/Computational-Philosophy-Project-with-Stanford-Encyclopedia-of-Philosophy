    "main_text": "Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) || OSR and Spacetime Physics\n4.3 OSR and Spacetime Physics\n\nThere has been much dispute about how General Relativity relates to\nrelationism and substantivalism about space and time. The main problem\nfor the latter is the general covariance of the field equations of\nGeneral Relativity: any spacetime model and its image under a\ndiffeomorphism (a infinitely differentiable, one-one and onto mapping\nof the model to itself) are in all observable respects equivalent to\none another; all physical properties are expressed in terms of\ngenerally covariant relationships between geometrical objects. Put\ncrudely, since the points of spacetime are intrinsically indiscernible\none from another, it makes no difference if we (smoothly) swap their\nproperties around so long as the overall structure remains the same.\nThis is made more apparent by the so-called \u201chole\nargument\u201d, which constructs diffeomorphic models such that if\nthey are regarded as physically distinct then there is a breakdown of\ndeterminism. John Earman and John Norton (1987) argue that\nsubstantivalists cannot just bite the bullet and accept this because\nthe question of determinism ought to be settled on empirical/physical\ngrounds and not a priori ones.\n\nThere have been a variety of responses to this problem. Lewis (1986)\nand Carol Brighouse (1994) suggest accepting haecceitism about\nspacetime points, but argue that it should not worry us that\nhaecceitistic determinism, that is determinism with respect to which\npoints end up with which metrical properties, fails. Melia (1999)\ncriticises the notion of determinism employed by Earman and Norton.\nNonetheless most philosophers of physics seem to have concluded that\nif spacetime points do have primitive identity, then the\nsubstantivalist who is committed to them must regard the failure of\nhaecceitistic determinism as a genuine failure of determinism. Hence,\nothers have sought to modify substantivalism. Carl Hoefer argues that\nthe problems for spacetime substantivalism turn on the\n\u201cascription of primitive identity to space-time points\u201d\n(1996: 11). Hence, it seems that interpreting spacetime in terms of an\nontology of underlying entities and their properties causes problems\nfor realism about spacetime.\n\nIn response various authors have adopted structural realism about\nspacetime. Robert DiSalle (1994) suggests that the correct response to\nthe hole argument is that the structure of spacetime be accepted as\nexistent despite its failure to supervene on the reality of spacetime\npoints. (Masoumi (2021a) also thinks that consideration of the hole\nargument supports OSR.) This is akin to the position developed by\nStein (1968) in his famous exchange with Gr\u00fcnbaum, according to\nwhich spacetime is neither a substance, not a set of relations between\nsubstances, but a structure in its own right. Similarly, Oliver Pooley\n(2007) argues that eliminativism about individual spacetime points can\nbe avoided without any tension with General Relativity, if it is\naccepted that the facts about their identity and diversity is grounded\nin relations they bear to each other. His sophisticated\nsubstantivalism allows that spacetime points be individuated\nrelationally and not independently of the metric field. This means\nembracing contextual individuality grounded in relational structure.\nSee also Cassirer who says:\n\n\nTo such a [spacetime] point also no being in itself can be ascribed;\nit is constituted by a definite aggregate of relations and consists in\nthis aggregate. (1936 [1956: 195])\n\n\nThe analogy between the debate about substantivalism, and the debate\nabout whether quantum particles are individuals made by Ladyman\n(1998), Stachel (2002 and 2006), and Saunders (2003a,b) is contested\nby Pooley (2006). He argues that there is no such analogy, or at least\nnot a very deep one, on the grounds that there is no metaphysical\nunderdetermination in GR. According to him the standard formulations\nof the theory are ontologically committed to the metric field, and the\nlatter is most naturally interpreted as representing \u201cspacetime\nstructure\u201d (90).\n\nOthers who have discussed structural realism and spacetime include,\nDorato (2000) who discusses spacetime and structural realism but\nrejects OSR, Esfeld and Lam (2008 and 2011) who argue for moderate\nontic structural realism about spacetime (as defined above), and Bain\n(2006), who says that:\n\n\nConformal structure, for instance, can be realised on many different\ntypes of \u201cindividuals\u201d: manifold points, twisters, or\nmultivectors \u2026What is real, the spacetime structuralist will\nclaim, is the structure itself and not the manner in which alternative\nformalisms instantiate it. (2006: 64)\n\n\nThere are interesting connections between spacetime structuralism and\nthe spacetime functionalism of Eleanor Knox (2019). Bain (2013) argues\nthat critics of radical ontic structural realism have implicitly\nrelied on a set-theoretic notion of structure and that a category\ntheoretic formulation of ontic structural realism is useful in\nexplicating the structure of physical theories, in particular, general\nrelativity. Lal and Teh (2017) respond to Bain downplaying the\nsignificance of category theory for structuralism, but their arguments\nare contested by Eva (2016). Quantum gravity and structuralism is\ndiscussed by philosophers and physicists in Rickles, French, and\nSaatsi (2006).\n",
