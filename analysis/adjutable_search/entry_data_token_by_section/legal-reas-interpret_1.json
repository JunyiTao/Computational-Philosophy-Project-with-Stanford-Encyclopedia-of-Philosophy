    "main_text": "The Role of Interpretation in Legal Reasoning: || Some Intellectual Roots Considered\n2.1 Some Intellectual Roots Considered\n\n\nRecent interest in the role of interpretation in legal reasoning\nsprings from several sources. For some, interpretation is where we\nshould look in order to find the solution, or at least the only\npossible response, to the problem of linguistic indeterminacy in law\nwhich they perceive (in turn, renewed interest in the problems of\nlinguistic indeterminacy in law seems to have stemmed at least in part\nfrom the resurgence in the last twenty years in scholarship addressing\nWittgenstein's remarks on rule-following in the Philosophical\nInvestigations (see e.g. Holtzman & Leich (eds.) 1981; Kripke\n1982; Baker & Hacker, 1984 & 1985), and the migration of these\nconcerns from philosophy of language into philosophy of law (see e.g.\nMarmor 1992 and the revised edition of that work, Marmor 2005; Stone\n1995; Smith 1990). Certain aspects of this trend, most notably that of\nacademic lawyers employing ill-digested Wittgenstein to dubious ends,\nare criticised by Bix 1993). According to this line of thinking, if\nwords, and legal rules composed of words, have no intrinsic meaning\nand hence cannot, in and of themselves, constrain legal reasoning,\nthen it must be we\u2014readers or interpreters\u2014who supply such\nmeaning via the process of interpretation (see Fish 1989; Cornell\n1992. Stone 1995 criticises this understanding of the role of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning, but notes its adoption by various\nlegal theorists). In the case of other theorists, interest in this\ntopic stems from a wish to investigate the parallels and divergences\nbetween interpretation in law and interpretation in literature\n(Levinson 1982; Dworkin 1985; Fish 1989).  The arrival on the\njurisprudential scene in the mid-1980s of Ronald Dworkin's powerful\nnew account of law as an interpretive concept, with concomitant\nimplications for the activities of both judges and legal theorists\n(see Dworkin 1986) also did much to contribute to interest in the role\nof interpretation in legal reasoning. Moreover, this account seemed to\nrouse Dworkin's legal positivist adversaries into elaborating more\nfully upon something which he has always claimed has been seriously\nunderdeveloped in their work (see e.g. Dworkin 1977), namely an\naccount of the nature of adjudication, and of the role of\ninterpretation within it (Marmor 1992 & 2005; Raz 1995; Raz 1996a\n& 1996b). Recent scholarship in constitutional theory concerning\nthe distinctive challenges posed by the interpretation of\nconstitutions has also helped fuel continuing interest in the topic of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning (see, for example, Bobbit 1991 &\n1996; Raz 1998b; Rubenfeld 1998; Kavanagh 2002, 2003 & 2009 part\nI; Sager 2004; Marmor 2005 ch. 9, Waluchow 2006 and the entry\n constitutionalism). \nIn some jurisdictions academic and public interest in interpretation\nin legal reasoning may have been sparked by changes in particular\nlegal arrangements: for example, as a result of the enactment of the\nHuman Rights Acts 1998 in the United Kingdom with its section 3 duty\nto read and give effect to primary and subordinate legislation in a\nway which is compatible with European Convention rights, or as a\nresult of the doctrine of consistent interpretation or indirect effect\ndeveloped by the European Court of Justice, requiring European Union\nMember States' courts to interpret domestic law so that it is\nconsistent with EU law, so far as it is possible to do so.  \n",
