    "main_text": "Doctrine of Cause and Effect || Definitions and other a posteriori necessary truths\n2.3 Definitions and other a posteriori necessary truths\n\nDefinitions of objects have attracted attention for several reasons.\nOne is that they. are holistic in the minimal sense that any given\nkind of object is defined in terms of other kinds of objects or\nqualities. For instance, fire can be defined as the object elicited by\nconcussion of flint and steel, and flint can be defined as the object\nthat, combined with steel, gives rise to fire. Some scholars worry\nthat Shepherd\u2019s definitions of natural kinds form a closed\nsystem that is impervious to refutation and seek a solution to the\nproblem. It seems those who have this worry assume the\ndefinitions in question are descriptive and to some extent formed\nwithout empirical guidance\u2014Locke\u2019s nominal essences in\neffect, As interpreted here, however, the definitions Shepherd has in\nview are formed on the basis of experience; they state the essential\nproperties of actual objects. She may think the meanings of names of\nkinds in a natural language are based on them.\n\nDefinitions have also attracted attention because they are a\nposteriori necessary truths. Kant has an account of how we can know\nsuch truths, but Shepherd does not follow him in distinguishing\nanalytic and synthetic judgments (LoLordo 2019: 10, note 25). She does\nnot address this issue in the direct sort of way we might expect. The\nissue for her is how we acquire knowledge and belief of the existence\nof the external world and the causal principles that are its\nfoundations. It turns out that this is knowledge of roughly the sort\nKant found he needed to explain. Perceptual knowledge is the topic of\nsection 3.1.\n",
