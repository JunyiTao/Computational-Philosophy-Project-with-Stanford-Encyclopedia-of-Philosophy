    "main_text": "Definitions of Evolution\n1. Definitions of Evolution\n\nThe definition of evolution given at the outset of this entry is very\ngeneral; there are more specific ones in the literature, some of which\ndo not fit this general characterization. Here is a sampling.\n\nAlthough the work of Charles Darwin (see the entry on\n Darwinism) is usually the starting \npoint for contemporary understandings\nof evolution, interestingly, he does not use the term in the first\nedition of On the Origin of Species, referring instead to\n\u201cdescent with modification\u201d. In the early-mid 20th\ncentury, the \u201cmodern synthesis\u201d gave birth to\n population genetics,\n which provided a mathematization of Darwinian evolutionary theory in\nlight of Mendelian genetics (see also the entry on\n ecological genetics).\n This yielded a prevalent\u2014probably the most\nprevalent\u2014understanding of evolution as \u201cany change in the\nfrequency of alleles within a population from one generation to the\nnext\u201d. Note, however, that this definition refers to evolution\nonly in a microevolutionary context and thus doesn\u2019t reference\nthe emergence of new species (and their new characteristics), although\nit is intended to underlie those macroevolutionary changes (see the\nentry on \n  philosophy of macroevolution). \n\nIn a popular textbook, Douglas Futuyma gives a more expansive\ndefinition: \n\n\n[biological evolution] is change in the properties of groups of\norganisms over the course of generations\u2026it embraces everything\nfrom slight changes in the proportions of different forms of a gene\nwithin a population to the alterations that led from the earliest\norganism to dinosaurs, bees, oaks, and humans. (2005: 2) \n\n\nNote also that Futuyma\u2019s definition, unlike the population\ngenetics\u2019 definition, does not limit itself to changes in\nalleles; John Endler\u2019s definition is similar in this\nrespect: \n\n\nEvolution may be defined as any net directional change or any\ncumulative change in the characteristics of organisms or populations\nover many generations\u2014in other words, descent with\nmodification\u2026 It explicitly includes the origin as well as the\nspread of alleles, variants, trait values, or character states.\n(Endler 1986: 5) \n\n\nYet even this definition is not expansive enough; molecular evolution\nfocuses on the molecular changes within macromolecules such as DNA and\nRNA. \n\nIn a very different vein, Leigh van Valen characterized evolution as\n\u201cthe control of development by ecology\u201d (1973, 488); this\nanticipates those who emphasize the importance of development in\nevolution, including proponents of \u201cevo-devo\u201d (see\n the entry on evolution and development).\n Today, some have called for an \u201cextended evolutionary\nsynthesis\u201d in light of developmental biology and other recent\nfindings in evolutionary biology.\n\nAlthough this entry focuses on biological evolution, philosophers and\nbiologists have also sought to extend evolutionary ideas to the\ncultural realm. Figuring out how and whether to extend the definition\nof evolution to this realm is part of the study of\n cultural evolution.\n \n\nIn spite of this diversity of definitions, there has been very little\nphilosophical analysis of the term \u201cevolution\u201d itself.\nThis dearth forms a stark contrast to the voluminous literature in the\nphilosophy of evolution; indeed, for a long time the\n philosophy of biology\n was focused almost entirely on evolution. Thankfully, that is no\nlonger the case, with philosophers turning their attentions to issues\nin genetics, \n  molecular biology,\n  cell biology, \n  ecology, \n  developmental biology,\n  microbiology, and\nmore. It may be, as Theodosius Dobzhansky famously said, that\n\u201cNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of\nevolution\u201d (1973: 125), but much of biology is not evolutionary\nbiology. Still, though, philosophy of evolution remains a growing and\nvibrant area within the philosophy of biology.\n",
