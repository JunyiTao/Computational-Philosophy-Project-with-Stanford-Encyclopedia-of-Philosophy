    "main_text": "Extending the Moral Domain\n9. Extending the Moral Domain\n\nAnimal ethics is a burgeoning field in ethics. The most famous work in\nthe area is, of course, that done by utilitarian Peter Singer, who\nargued that the best consequences will be brought about if we become\nvegetarians, thereby ending the terrible suffering endured by animals\nraised for food. Following in Singer\u2019s footsteps, much of animal\nethics is concerned with issues surrounding the use of animals for\nfood, scientific research, and entertainment purposes, legal issues\naddressing overt cruelty to animals, and how to deal with rapidly\nincreasing populations of both domestic and wild animals.\n\nBut, recently, some philosophers have begun to focus their attention\non companion animals, i.e., those cats, dogs, fish, birds, etc., that\nmany of us take into our homes and care for as pets. (See\nBurgess-Jackson, Rollin, Palmer.) Americans spend small fortunes\nproviding medical care for their animal companions, and lavish time,\nattention, and love on them. Many of us regard our cats or dogs as\nmembers of our family, and we feel ourselves obligated to take special\ncare of our animal companions. But can we really have special\nobligations to non-human animals? If not, how can we possibly justify\nthe resources expended on companion animals, given the amount of human\nsuffering in the world?\n\nIn order adequately to address the question whether we have special\nobligations to our companion animals, we need to do more investigation\ninto the nature of the relationship that we have to animals and the\nnature of our companion animals. Can we be friends with creatures\nother than human beings? (See Jeske 2008b.) Can we make promises to\nanimals? Can we bear relevant psychological connections to animals?\nThese questions need serious attention if we are to insure that we\nmeet our moral obligations to the vulnerable creatures that we call\npets.\n",
