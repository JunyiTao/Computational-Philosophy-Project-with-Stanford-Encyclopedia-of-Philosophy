    "main_text": "Thirteenth-century Franciscans\n4. Thirteenth-century Franciscans\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s position would remain ascendant among Christian\nphilosophers for most of the Middle Ages. Thirteenth-century\nFranciscans, led by figures such as Bonaventure (c.1217\u20131274) and\nMatthew of Aquasparta (c.1237\u20131302), gave the theory a detailed and\nsystematic defense, focusing on the changeability and hence uncertainty\nof the human mind and the sensory world (see Marrone 2001). Bonaventure\ncharacteristically argues, \nThings have existence in the mind, in their own nature\n(proprio genere), and in the eternal art. So the truth of\nthings as they are in the mind or in their own nature \u2014 given that\nboth are changeable \u2014 is sufficient for the soul to have certain\nknowledge only if the soul somehow reaches things as they are in the\neternal art (De scientia Christi, q.4 resp.).\n\n\nCertain knowledge requires steadfast unchangeability. Since that can\nbe found only in the divine mind, and since we have access to the\ndivine mind only through illumination, certain knowledge requires\nillumination.\n\n\nThis line of argument came to seem increasingly old-fashioned as the\nthirteenth century progressed. The growing influence of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of cognition, as developed in particular by the Dominican friars\nAlbert the Great (c.1200\u20131280) and his student, Thomas Aquinas\n(c.1225\u20131274), offered an impressive picture of how human beings might\nbe able to achieve certain knowledge despite the changeability of mind\nand matter. These developments struck many Franciscans as a betrayal of\nChristianity. John Pecham (c.1225\u20131292), in a letter dating from 1285,\nwrites\nI do not in any way disapprove of philosophical studies,\ninsofar as they serve theological mysteries, but I do disapprove of\nirreverent innovations in language, introduced within the last twenty\nyears into the depths of theology against philosophical truth and to\nthe detriment of the Fathers, whose positions are disdained and openly\nheld in contempt.\n\n\nContinuing, Pecham criticizes the doctrine \nwhich fills the entire world with wordy quarrels, weakening\nand destroying with all its strength what Augustine teaches concerning\nthe eternal rules and the unchangeable light\u2026. (quoted in Gilson\n1955, p.359).\n\n\nAt roughly the same time, Roger Marston (c.1235\u20131303) writes of those\nwho, \u201cdrunk on the nectar of philosophy \u2026 twisted toward their\nown sense all of Augustine\u2019s authoritative texts on the unchanging\nlight and the eternal rules\u201d (Quaestiones disputatae de anima\n3 ad 30). \n\n\nMarston\u2019s view is particularly interesting because he proposes a\nsynthesis of Augustine and Aristotle. On his view,\nIt is necessary to posit in our mind, beyond the phantasms\nor abstracted species, something by which we to some degree attain the\nunchanging truths. I believe this to be no different than the influence\nof the eternal light\u2026. For the eternal light, irradiating the human\nmind, makes a certain active impression on it, from which a certain\npassive impression is left in it, which is the formal principle of\ncognizing the unchanging truths (De anima 3,\np.263).\n\n\nRather than dismiss the agent intellect as superfluous, Marston\nfollows Alexander of Aphrodisias et al. in treating the agent intellect\nas separate and divine \u2014 indeed, as God himself. Earlier in the\nthirteenth century, William of Auvergne (c.1180\u20131249) had in effect\nidentified the agent intellect with God (The Soul 7.6; cf. Gilson 1926\u201327, pp.67\u201372). Such cases illustrate how the\nvarious medieval disputes over whether human beings might share a\nsingle intellect \u2014 so absurd on their face \u2014 are in fact simply\nalternative formulations of the dispute over divine illumination. But\nthere were subtle differences among the various approaches. So whereas\nAuvergne largely turns his back on Aristotle, Marston is more\naccommodating. In addition to the divine agent intellect, he allows\nthat each human being possesses its own agent intellect.\n\n\nOn Marston\u2019s account, Aristotle and Augustine turn out to be\nentirely in harmony: each uses his own terminology to defend the same\ntheory of divine illumination (De anima 3, p. 258).\n\u00c9tienne Gilson (1933) has characterized Marston\u2019s position as\nan Avicennized Augustinianism (Augustinisme avicennisant).\nBut this label prejudices the case in favor of Aquinas\u2019s perspective:\nit assumes that Marston has been seduced by an Islamic misreading of\nAristotle, and it closes off the possibility that Augustine and\nAristotle might have more in common than is typically allowed.\n\n\nThe case of Peter John Olivi (1247/8\u20131298) demonstrates how\nprecarious a position the illumination theory held by the 1280s. Olivi,\na Franciscan whose work would eventually be condemned by his own order,\npresents a compelling critique of the Augustinian illumination theory\n(I Sent., q. 2), presenting his comments in the form of\n\u201ccautions\u201d (cavenda). The theory, he notes, is often very\nvague with respect to the actual process of illumination. And in\nrunning through the various possible accounts of the process available\nto a defender of the theory, Olivi appears to rule out every one. The\neternal reasons cannot represent things distinctly and specifically,\nbecause then we would have no need of any sensory input. But if the\neternal reasons give us information only of a general and indistinct\nsort, then at what level of generality? Does it supply us with\ninformation about species, or genera? If divine illumination is\nefficacious at any level, why do we seem to need the senses for all of\nour concepts? Olivi\u2019s questions and cautions go on and on. But after\nlaying an entire minefield of this sort for anyone who would defend\ndivine illumination \u2014 at ad 6 he rejects the Augustinian argument set\nout above by Bonaventure \u2014 he nevertheless comes to the surprising\nconclusion that he accepts the theory:\nThese things, since I don\u2019t know how to analyze them fully,\nI set out only as cautions. For although the stated position is in\nitself venerable (sollemnis) and sensible, it could\nnevertheless be quite dangerous to those who are not carefully\nsupervised. And so I hold the stated position as it is, because it\nbelongs to men who are highly venerable. Nevertheless I leave an\nexposition of the above to their wisdom (q. 2, pp. 512\u201313).\n\n\nThis was a favorite strategy of Olivi\u2019s: to criticize a theory\nfiercely, exposing seemingly devastating difficulties, and then to\nembrace the theory anyway, as a pious gesture of respect. It\u2019s hard to\nresist reading between the lines, and concluding that dusk was fast\napproaching for the theory of divine illumination. \n",
