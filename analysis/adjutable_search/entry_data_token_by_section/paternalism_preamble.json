    "main_text": "\n\nPaternalism is the interference of a state or an individual with\nanother person, against their will, and defended or motivated by a\nclaim that the person interfered with will be better off or protected\nfrom harm. The issue of paternalism arises with respect to\nrestrictions by the law such as anti-drug legislation, the compulsory\nwearing of seatbelts, and in medical contexts by the withholding of\nrelevant information concerning a patient\u2019s condition by\nphysicians. At the theoretical level it raises questions of how\npersons should be treated when they are less than fully rational. \n",
