    "main_text": "The Status of Instrumental Rationality || The Relevance of Carroll\u2019s Paradox\n4.2 The Relevance of Carroll\u2019s Paradox\n\nLewis Carroll (1895) introduced a famous paradox concerning modus\nponens. Some philosophers have argued that an instrumental\nanalogue of this paradox shows there to be something special about\ninstrumental rationality, and perhaps even provides support for some\nversion of the thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind\nof practical rationality.\n\nCarroll imagined a conversation between Achilles and a Tortoise\nregarding the following valid argument:\n\n(A)\nThings that are equal to the same are equal to each other.\n(B)\nThe two sides of the Triangle are equal to the same.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n(Z)\nThe two sides are equal to each other.\n\n\nThe Tortoise adopts a skeptical position, asking how he can be\nlogically forced into accepting (Z) when he accepts (A) and (B).\nAchilles attempts to supply him with the missing premise:\n\n(C)\nIf (A) & (B) are true, (Z) must be true.\n\n\nBut the Tortoise grants (C), and resumes his skepticism, asking how he\ncan be logically forced to accept (Z) when he accepts (A), (B), and\n(C). It soon dawns on Achilles that the mere addition of further\npremises (like \u201cIf (A), (B), and (C) are true, (Z) must be\ntrue\u201d, and so on) won\u2019t help resolve the Tortoise\u2019s\nskepticism. One could keep on adding such premises ad\ninfinitum and yet not get the Tortoise to accept (Z).\n\nMuch has been written about what lessons to draw from Carroll\u2019s\nparadox, but this much seems clear: the Tortoise refuses to accept (Z)\nbecause he refuses to apply modus ponens to the premises he\naccepts. So, if modus ponens itself is merely\naccepted by him as yet another premise, that won\u2019t suffice to\nget him to accept (Z).\n\nNow, imagine we confront someone who holds some end E,\nbelieves some means M is necessary for E-ing, yet\ndoesn\u2019t intend to M, and, like the Tortoise,\ndoesn\u2019t intend to M because he refuses to\napply instrumental rationality to the ends he has, including\nE. If we suggest that he remedy this defect by adopting yet\nanother end (namely, the end of doing what instrumental rationality\nrequires), this wouldn\u2019t help matters. Since his problem is that\nhe doesn\u2019t apply instrumental rationality to the ends he has, he\nwouldn\u2019t apply instrumental rationality to this new end as well,\nand so still wouldn\u2019t intend to M (or drop the\nintention to E). So, the mere addition of instrumental\nrationality as another end would be futile.\n\nWhat should we conclude from this instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox? Railton (1997) argues that it shows that a\ncertain form of skepticism about rationality\u2014specifically,\none\u2019s asking \u201cWhy should I comply with the norms of\npractical rationality?\u201d\u2014can be answered. First, the asking\nof this skeptical question reveals a commitment to at least\ninstrumental rationality, since one is here questioning whether being\npractically rational would advance one\u2019s ends. And,\nsecond, the instrumental analogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox shows\nthat we can\u2019t think of this commitment to instrumental\nrationality as merely another end the agent accepts and could dismiss\nat will. If the skeptic thinks it is, Railton suggests that \u201cwe\ncan answer \u2018No, on pain of regress, it cannot be just another\nend of yours\u2019\u201d (p. 317).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not clear why the skeptic would have to think of\ninstrumental rationality as just another end she has. Couldn\u2019t\nshe think of it instead as (or also as) a disposition that she\nmanifests, or a capacity that she exercises, with respect to the ends\nthat she accepts? (If so, she would avoid the particular problem that\nconfronts the character in the instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox, who merely accepts instrumental rationality\nas another end without applying it to her ends.) And then\ncouldn\u2019t she request some philosophical explanation of why she\nshould exercise that capacity? That she already has the capacity is of\ncourse no barrier to posing such a question (Wedgwood 2005). Indeed,\nas we\u2019ve seen in\n \u00a73.3,\n some philosophers have denied that we always ought, or have\nreason, to be instrumentally coherent; they\u2019ve argued that\nrational requirements are only apparently normative, or are merely\nevaluative.\n\nDreier (2001) concludes that the instrumental analogue of\nCarroll\u2019s paradox shows that instrumental rationality has a\nspecial status. In Carroll\u2019s original paradox, the Tortoise\nwould be such that we couldn\u2019t give him reasons to believe in\nsome proposition. In the normal case, I can provide you with a reason\nto believe Q by getting you to believe P and to\nbelieve P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q. But this simply\nwon\u2019t work for the Tortoise, who refuses to apply modus\nponens. Likewise, Dreier observes, we would be incapable of\ngiving reasons to someone who refused to draw \u201cpractical\ninferences\u201d between ends and means. The acceptance of\ninstrumental rationality is thus, he argues, a necessary condition for\nbeing receptive to reasons at all. And this supports his conclusion\nthat \u201cthe only ultimate sort of reasons are instrumental\nreasons\u201d (p. 43). This seems to be an endorsement of the\nDesire-Based Theory.\n\nDoes the conclusion follow? Even if a disposition to be instrumentally\nrational is indispensable in the way Dreier suggests to\nhaving a practical reason, nothing follows about\nwhat one has practical reason to do. Additionally, it\u2019s\nworth noting that it\u2019s doubtful that Carroll\u2019s original\nparadox would license a restriction on the scope of\ntheoretical reasons analogous to the Humean restriction on\nthe scope of practical reasons that Dreier thinks the instrumental\nanalogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox supports. That is, it is not\nobvious that I have reason to believe Q only if I am disposed\nto come to believe it by applying modus ponens. Perhaps my\nmerely believing, with reason, both P and\nP\u2009\u2192\u2009Q provides me with a reason\nfor believing Q. Or perhaps the mere fact the available\nevidence supports Q is enough (Jollimore 2005).\n\nKorsgaard (2009) argues that we can draw a conclusion about the\nmetaethical status of instrumental rationality by considering\nan instrumental analogue of Carroll\u2019s paradox. Specifically, she\nappeals to it to argue against metaethical realism about instrumental\nrationality (and about other normative principles as well).\nLet\u2019s suppose that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent. A realist would claim that there is some\nnormative fact, according to which we ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent. But a skeptic might ask, \u201cWhy ought I apply that\nfact\u2014that I ought to be instrumentally coherent\u2014to my\nactions?\u201d The realist might answer, \u201cBecause\u2014and\nhere\u2019s another normative fact\u2014it just is the case that you\nought to apply the fact that you ought to be instrumentally coherent\nto your actions.\u201d But one might resume one\u2019s skepticism\nand ask why one must apply that normative fact to one\u2019s\nactions. One could keep adding normative facts ad infinitum\nwithout providing an answer to the question, in the same way that\nAchilles could keep adding premises without meeting the\nTortoise\u2019s challenge.\n\nA full discussion of the metaethical issues raised by this argument\nwould take us too far afield (see Parfit 2006). But one strategy of\nreply is to argue that the realist has already answered the question.\nWhat it is for such normative facts to be normative just is\nthat they require that you act in some way. If you\u2019re asking of\nnormative facts in general why you should act in accordance with them,\nthen you don\u2019t fully understand what normative facts are.\n",
