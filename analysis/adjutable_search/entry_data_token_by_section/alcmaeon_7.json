    "main_text": "Epistemology and Psychology || Sense Perception\n2.4 Sense Perception\n\nTheophrastus says that Alcmaeon did not explain sensation by the\nprinciple of like to like (i.e. by the likeness between the sense\norgan and what is perceived), a principle which was used by many early\nGreek thinkers (e.g., Empedocles). Unfortunately he gives no general\naccount of how Alcmaeon did think sensation worked (DK, A5). Alcmaeon\nexplained each of the individual senses with the exception of touch,\nbut these accounts are fairly rudimentary. He regarded the eye as\ncomposed of water and fire and vision as taking place when what is\nseen is reflected in the gleaming and translucent part of the eye.\nHearing arises when an external sound is first transmitted to the\nouter ear and then picked up by the empty space (kenon) in\nthe inner ear, which transmits it to the brain. Taste occurs through\nthe tongue, which being warm and soft dissolves things with its heat\nand, because of its loose texture, receives and transmits the\nsensation. Smell is the simplest of all. It occurs \u201cat the same\ntime as we breathe in, thus bringing the breath to the brain\u201d\n(DK, A5).\n",
