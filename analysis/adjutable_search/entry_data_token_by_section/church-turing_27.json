    "main_text": "The Church-Turing Thesis and the Limits of Machines || The \u201cequivalence fallacy\u201d\n5.2 The \u201cequivalence fallacy\u201d\n\nA common argument for the maximality thesis, or an equivalent, cites\nthe fact, noted above, that many different attempts to analyse the\ninformal notion of computability in precise terms\u2014attempts by\nTuring, Church, Post, Markov, and others\u2014turned out to be\nequivalent to one another, in the sense that each analysis\nprovably picks out the same class of functions, namely those functions\ncomputable by Turing machines.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this convergence of analyses is often\nconsidered strong evidence for the Church-Turing thesis (this is the\nequivalence argument for the\n thesis\u2014Section 4.1).\n Some go further and take this convergence to be evidence also for the\nmaximality thesis. Newell, for example, presented the convergence of\nthe analyses given by Turing, Church, Post, Markov, et al., as showing\nthat\n\n\nall attempts to \u2026 formulate \u2026 general notions of\nmechanism \u2026 lead to classes of machines that are equivalent in\nthat they encompass in toto exactly the same set of\ninput-output functions. (Newell 1980: 150)\n\n\nThe various equivalent analyses, said Newell, constitute a\n\n\nlarge zoo of different formulations of maximal classes of machines.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nArguably there is a fallacy here. The analyses Newell is discussing\nare of the concept of an effective method: The equivalence of the\nanalyses bears only on the question of the extent of what is\nhumanly computable, not on the further question whether\nfunctions generatable by machines could extend beyond what is\nin principle humanly computable.\n",
