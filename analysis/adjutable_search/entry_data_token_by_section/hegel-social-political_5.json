    "main_text": "Freedom and Right\n2. Freedom and Right\n\nHegel conceives the PR primarily as a philosophy of\nfreedom. This is made clear in the PR\u2019s Introduction,\nwhich starts by declaring that \u201cthe subject-matter of the\nphilosophical science of right is the Idea of right \u2013 the concept\nof right [Recht] and its actualization\u201d\n(PR \u00a71). The PR\u2019s aim to provide a\nphilosophical account of \u201cright\u201d and its realization in the\nworld.\n\nHegel admits the existence of right is presupposed from his\nphilosophical system, of which the PR elaborates one part\n(PR \u00a72). The PR\u2019s Introduction proceeds to\nsummarise the dialectical argument for the free will discussed at\ngreater length elsewhere in Hegel\u2019s philosophical system. Our\nwill \u201cdetermines itself\u201d (PR \u00a74 Addition).\nThe challenge is determining whether or not its content is a product of\nfreedom or mere arbitrariness. We must be able to discern the bare\npursuit of being a slave to our passions like, for Hegel, the animal\nworld from the rational world of human beings. Hegel sees the\nPR as an examination into how \u201cthe free will which wills\nthe free will\u201d can be known in form and content (PR\n\u00a727).\n\nHegel defines \u201cright\u201d [Recht] as the existence\nof the free will in the world (PR \u00a729). So a philosophy\nof right is necessarily a philosophy of freedom that seeks to\ncomprehend freedom actualized in how we relate to each other and\nconstruct social and political institutions.\n\nFollowing his dialectical method, Hegel approaches the development\nof our comprehension of right through these stages: Abstract Right,\nMorality and Ethical Life. We progress from one stage to the next in a\ndistinctive way where apparent contradictions arising in each stage are\ndissolved through attaining a higher stage, where this cycle is\nrepeated and progress made since the beginning remains present where\nwhat was abstract and opaque at first becomes more concrete as we\nadvance to the end of this work. This multi-layered, dialectical nature\nof Hegel\u2019s argument does give his philosophical work an added\ncomplexity, but also a richness that close study rewards \u2013 while\nthis entry only focuses on the broad outlines of his arguments.\n",
