    "main_text": "Possible Worlds Models || Strict conditionals\n3.1 Strict conditionals\n\nThe first step toward an intensional treatment of conditionals was\nmade with C. I. Lewis\u2019s introduction of the strict conditional.\nAlthough Lewis\u2019s treatment was axiomatic, its semantic content\ncan be made transparent using possible worlds semantics. On\nLewis\u2019s approach, \u201cIf \\(A\\), then \\(C\\)\u201d means that\nthe material conditional is not just true, but necessarily true:\n\n\\[\\tag{SI} (A >B ) \\equiv \\Box (A\\supset B).\\]\n\n\nFrom a semantic view point, reference is made here not just to the\nactual world, but also to other possible worlds, in fact to all\n\u201caccessible\u201d worlds. Thus, the meaning of this conditional\ncannot be explained by a simple truth table.\n\nIn modal logic, a Kripke frame is a pair \\(\\langle W,\nR\\rangle\\) where \\(W\\) is a non-empty set of possible worlds\n(possible states, possible situations or possible ways the world might\nbe) and \\(R\\) is a binary relation on \\(W\\). \\(R\\) is called the\naccessibility relation of the model, and intuitively \\(Rwv\\)\nmeans that world \\(v\\) is (in some sense) possible from the point of\nview of \\(w\\). A model is a triple \\(\\langle W, R, V\\rangle\\)\nsuch that \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is a frame and \\(V\\) is a valuation\nfunction assigning truth values to all propositional variables of the\nlanguage at all possible worlds in \\(W\\). We write \\(M, w \\Vdash A\\)\nfor \u201c\\(A\\) is true at world \\(w\\) in model \\(M\\)\u201d and let\n\\(\\lvert A\\rvert^M\\) denote the set \\(\\{w\\in W: M, w \\Vdash A\\}\\) of\npossible worlds at which \\(A\\) is true. Let \\(R(w) := \\{v\\in W:\nRwv\\}\\). The truth conditions for the Boolean connectives are the\nusual ones for propositional logic, extending \\(V\\) to complex\nsentences. Those for the strict conditional are as follows:\n\n\\[\\tag{SC } \\begin{align} M, w \\Vdash A >B & \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad \\text{for all } v \\text{ such that } Rwv,\\quad M, v \\Vdash A \\supset B\\\\ & \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad R(w) \\cap \\lvert A\\rvert^M \\subseteq \\lvert B\\rvert^M.\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nValidity (relative to a class of frames) is defined as\ntruth-preservation at all worlds of all models (based on any frame in\nthe class). It is easy to see that the strict conditional invalidates\nthe paradoxes of the material conditional, relative to models built on\narbitrary Kripke frames. The strict conditional retains Modus Ponens\nand a number of classic properties, such as Monotonicity,\nTransitivity, and Contraposition (see below). Starting with Goodman\n(1955), however, such inferences have been regarded with suspicion,\nboth for indicative conditionals (see Adams 1965) and for\ncounterfactuals conditionals (see Stalnaker 1968, Lewis 1973). For\ninstance, in the case of Transitivity, we have the following\ncounterexamples:\n\n(1)\nIf Brown wins the election, Smith will retire to private life. If\nSmith dies before the election, Brown will win it. #Therefore, if\nSmith dies before the election, then he will retire to private life.\n(Adams 1965, p. 166)\n(2)\nIf J. Edgar Hoover were today a communist, then he would be a\ntraitor. If J. Edgar Hoover had been born a Russian, then he would\ntoday be a communist. #Therefore, if J. Edgar Hoover had been born a\nRussian, he would be a traitor. (Stalnaker 1968, p. 106)\n\n\nSuch examples inspired Adams to propose a probabilistic treatment of\nconditionals. They inspired Stalnaker, Lewis, Nute, and a number of\nothers to weaken the strict conditional analysis. But recently there\nhas been a revival of the strict conditional analysis, based on the\nidea that many phenomena can be accounted for pragmatically by\nconstruing the accessibility relation that determines which possible\nworlds are relevant as massively context-dependent (Daniels &\nFreeman 1980; von Fintel 2001; Gillies 2007; Starr 2014a, and\nStarr\u2019s entry on counterfactuals).\n",
