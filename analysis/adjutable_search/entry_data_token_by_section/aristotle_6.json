    "main_text": "Logic, Science, and Dialectic || Dialectic\n4.3 Dialectic\n\n\n           \nNot all rigorous reasoning qualifies as scientific. Indeed,\nlittle of Aristotle\u2019s extant writing conforms to the demands for\nscientific presentation laid down in the Posterior\nAnalytics. As he recognizes, we often find ourselves\nreasoning from premises which have the status of endoxa,\nopinions widely believed or endorsed by the wise, even though they are\nnot known to be necessary. Still less often do we reason having\nfirst secured the first principles of our domain of inquiry. So,\nwe need some \u2018method by which we will be able to reason\ndeductively about any matter proposed to us on the basis of\nendoxa, and to give an account of ourselves [when we are under\nexamination by an interlocutor] without lapsing into\ncontradiction\u2019 (Top. 100a18\u201320).   This method\nhe characterizes as dialectic. \n\n\n           \nThe suggestion that we often use dialectic when engaged in\nphilosophical exchange reflects Aristotle\u2019s supposition that\nthere are two sorts of dialectic: one negative, or destructive, and the\nother positive, or constructive. In fact, in his work dedicated\nto dialectic, the Topics, he identifies three roles for\ndialectic in intellectual inquiry, the first of which is mainly\npreparatory:\n\n\nDialectic is useful for three purposes: for training, for\nconversational exchange, and for sciences of a philosophical\nsort. That it is useful for training purposes is directly evident\non the basis of these considerations: once we have a direction for our\ninquiry we will more readily be able to engage a subject proposed to\nus. It is useful for conversational exchange because once we have\nenumerated the beliefs of the many, we shall engage them not on the\nbasis of the convictions of others but on the basis of their own; and\nwe shall re-orient them whenever they appear to have said something\nincorrect to us. It is useful for philosophical sorts of sciences\nbecause when we are able to run through the puzzles on both sides of an\nissue we more readily perceive what is true and what is false. \nFurther, it is useful for uncovering what is primary among the\ncommitments of a science. For it is impossible to say anything\nregarding the first principles of a science on the basis of the first\nprinciples proper to the very science under discussion, since among all\nthe commitments of a science, the first principles are the primary\nones. This comes rather, necessarily, from discussion of the\ncredible beliefs (endoxa) belonging to the science. This\nis peculiar to dialectic, or is at least most proper to it. For\nsince it is what cross-examines, dialectic contains the way to the\nfirst principles of all inquiries. (Top. 101a26\u2013b4)\n\n\nThe first two of the three forms of dialectic identified by Aristotle\nare rather limited in scope. By contrast, the third is philosophically\nsignificant.\n\n\n           \nIn its third guise, dialectic has a role to play in \u2018science\nconducted in a philosophical manner\u2019 (pros tas kata\nphilosphian epist\u00eamas; Top. 101a27\u201328, 101a34),\nwhere this sort of science includes what we actually find him pursuing\nin his major philosophical treatises. In these contexts,\ndialectic helps to sort the endoxa, relegating some to a\ndisputed status while elevating others; it submits endoxa to\ncross-examination in order to test their staying power; and, most\nnotably, according to Aristotle, dialectic puts us on the road to first\nprinciples (Top. 100a18\u2013b4). If that is so, then\ndialectic plays a significant role in the order of philosophical\ndiscovery: we come to establish first principles in part by determining\nwhich among our initial endoxa withstand sustained\nscrutiny. Here, as elsewhere in his philosophy, Aristotle evinces\na noteworthy confidence in the powers of human reason and\ninvestigation.\n",
