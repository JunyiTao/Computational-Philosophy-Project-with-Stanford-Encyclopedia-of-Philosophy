    "main_text": "Analytical Marxism || Components\n1.1 Components\n\nThe arrival of analytical Marxism is often dated by the appearance, in\n1978, of Karl Marx\u2019s Theory of History. A Defence by\nG.A. Cohen (1941\u20132009). This particular label seems to have been\ncoined by Jon Elster (1940\u2013), and first appears in print as the\ntitle of a collection published in 1986 and edited by John Roemer\n(1945\u2013). Those three figures\u2014Cohen, Elster, and\nRoemer\u2014are plausibly seen as the founders of analytical Marxism\nas a self-conscious intellectual current.\n\nThe label \u201canalytical Marxism\u201d requires some unpacking.\nIts component terms obviously get used in a wide variety of ways, and\nthe combination looks an unnatural one to some.\n\nAnalytical Marxism often describes itself as the self-conscious\nproduct of Marxist and non-Marxist traditions, and the\n\u201canalytical\u201d modifier is provided by the latter.\n\u201cNon-Marxist\u201d is intended as a neutral descriptive term.\nIt is not, for instance, equivalent to the pejorative use of\n\u201cun-Marxist\u201d by what\u2014equally\npejoratively\u2014might be called \u201ctrue believers\u201d.\n\nThis dual inheritance takes a very particular form. Analytical Marxism\nis not a miscellaneous assembly of Marxist and non-Marxist elements,\nbut rather embodies a distinctive division of labour between these\ntwo.\n",
