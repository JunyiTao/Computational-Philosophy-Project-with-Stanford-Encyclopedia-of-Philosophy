    "main_text": "The Case for the Church-Turing Thesis || Skepticism about the inductive and equivalence arguments\n4.2 Skepticism about the inductive and equivalence arguments\n\nIt is a general feature of inductive arguments that, while they may\nsupply strong evidence, they nevertheless do not establish their\nconclusions with certainty. A stronger argument for the Church-Turing\nthesis is to be desired. Gandy said that the inductive argument\n\n\ncannot settle the philosophical (or foundational) question. It might\nhappen that one day some genius established an entirely new sort of\ncalculation. (Gandy 1988: 79)\n\n\nDershowitz and Gurevich highlighted the difficulty:\n\n\nHistory is full of examples of delayed discoveries. Aristotelian and\nNewtonian mechanics lasted much longer than the seventy years that\nhave elapsed since Church proposed identifying effectiveness with\nrecursiveness, but still those physical theories were eventually found\nlacking. (Dershowitz & Gurevich 2008: 304)\n\n\nDershowitz and Gurevich presented a highly relevant example of delayed\ndiscovery (following Barendregt 1997: 187): Any hope that the\neffectively calculable functions could be identified with the\nprimitive recursive functions\u2014introduced in 1923\n(Skolem 1923; P\u00e9ter 1935)\u2014evaporated a few years later,\nwhen Ackermann described an effectively calculable function that is\nnot primitive recursive (Ackermann 1928).\n\nThe equivalence argument has also been deemed unsatisfactory.\nDershowitz and Gurevich call it \u201cweak\u201d (2008: 304). After\nall, the fact that a number of statements are equivalent does not show\nthe statements are true, only that if one is true, all are\u2014and\nif one is false, all are. Kreisel wrote:\n\n\nThe support for Church\u2019s thesis \u2026 certainly does not\nconsist in \u2026 the equivalence of different characterizations:\nwhat excludes the case of a systematic error? (Kreisel 1965:\n144)\n\n\nMendelson put the point more mildly, saying that the equivalence\nargument is \u201cnot conclusive\u201d:\n\n\nIt is conceivable that all the equivalent notions define a concept\nthat is related to, but not identical with, effective computability.\n(Mendelson 1990: 228)\n\n\nClearly, what is required is a direct argument for the thesis from\nfirst principles. Turing\u2019s argument I fills this role.\n",
