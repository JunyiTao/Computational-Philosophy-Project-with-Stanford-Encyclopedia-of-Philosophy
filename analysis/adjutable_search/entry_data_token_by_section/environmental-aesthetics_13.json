    "main_text": "Environmental Aesthetics, Environmentalism, and Future Directions || Environmental Aesthetics and Environmentalism\n5.1 Environmental Aesthetics and Environmentalism\n\nThe relationships between contemporary environmentalism and the\npositions and ideas of environmental aesthetics have sources in the\naesthetics of nature developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. As noted, early environmental movements, especially in\nNorth America, were fueled by a mode of aesthetic appreciation shaped\nnot only by the notion of the picturesque but also by ideas developed\nby thinkers such as Muir (Hargrove 1979, Callicott 1994, Wattles 2013,\nBrady 2018). However, more recently the relationship between\nenvironmental aesthetics and environmentalism has seemed somewhat more\nproblematic (Carlson 2010). Some individuals interested in the\nconservation and protection of both natural and human heritage\nenvironments have not found in traditional aesthetics of nature the\nresources that they believe are needed in order to carry out an\nenvironmentalist agenda (Loftis 2003). Others investigate problems\nposed by environments with unique features, such as isolation, for it\nis seemingly difficult to justify on aesthetic grounds the\npreservation of natural environments that are isolated such as to be\nessentially hidden from human aesthetic appreciation (Parsons\n2015). The problem is especially acute concerning environments, such\nas wetlands, that do not fit conventional conceptions of scenic beauty\n(Rolston 2000, Callicott 2003). Moreover, in line with earlier\ncriticisms that much of the empirical work in landscape assessment and\nplanning was focused only on scenic, picturesque environments, much of\nthe historical tradition concerning the aesthetic appreciation of\nnature has been called into question. Various themes in the aesthetics\nof nature, such as appreciation grounded in the idea of the\npicturesque, have been criticized in a number of ways: as\nanthropocentric (Godlovitch 1994), scenery-obsessed (Saito 1998a),\ntrivial (Callicott 1994), subjective (Thompson 1995), and/or morally\nvacuous (Andrews 1998). Similarly, in agreement with the aesthetics of\nengagement\u2019s critique of the theory of disinterestedness, some\nfind that concept to be questionable from an environmental standpoint\n(Rolston 1998).\n\nThere are a variety of responses to these kinds of criticisms of\ntraditional aesthetics of nature and of the notions of\ndisinterestedness and the picturesque. Some reassess and defend the\nidea of the picturesque, arguing that it, as well as some other\naspects of the eighteenth century tradition, has been misunderstood by\nsome contemporary aestheticians (Brook 2008, Paden et al\n2013, Paden 2013 2015a 2015b, Earle 2015). Others turn to the\ninvestigation of the long neglected member of the original\neighteenth-century triumvirate of the beautiful, the sublime, and the\npicturesque, finding in the sublime new resources for approaching the\naesthetic appreciation of the natural world (Brady 2012 2013, Shapshay\n2013, Mahoney 2016). However, whatever the final verdict about the\nsignificance of the picturesque and the sublime, the resources of\nnon-cognitive approaches, especially the aesthetics of engagement, are\ntaken to counter the criticisms that, due to the influence of ideas\nsuch as that of the picturesque, aesthetic experience of nature must\nbe both anthropocentric and scenery-obsessed (Rolston 1998 2002). The\ncharge of anthropocentricity is also explicitly addressed by the\nmystery approach, which attempts to give aesthetic appreciation of\nnature an \u201cacentric\u201d basis (Godlovitch 1994). Concerning\nthe concept of disinterestedness, some philosophers yet hold the view\nthat some form of the theory of disinterestedness is essential, since\nwithout it the notion of the aesthetic itself lacks conceptual\ngrounding (Budd 2002), while others claim that an analysis of\naesthetic experience in terms of the concept of disinterestedness\nhelps to meet the charges that traditional aesthetics is\nanthropocentric and subjective, since such an analysis supports the\nobjectivity of aesthetic judgments (Brady 2003). Similarly, cognitive\naccounts also furnish replies to some of these charges. Scientific\ncognitivism in particular, with its focus on scientific knowledge such\nas that given by geology and ecology, is claimed to help meet the\nworry that aesthetic appreciation of environments is of little\nsignificance in environmental conservation and preservation since\naesthetic appreciation is trivial and subjective (Hettinger 2005,\nParsons 2006a 2008a). Nonetheless, the extent to which scientific\ncognitivism and related ecology-dependent views can successfully\naddress such problems and doubts concerning the appropriate aesthetic\nappreciation of both natural and human environments is also questioned\non various grounds (Budd 2002, Hettinger 2007, Berleant 2010a 2016,\nBannon 2011, Stecker 2012, Herguedas 2018, Mikkonen 2018).\n\nLike the movement toward more ecologically informed aesthetic\nappreciation, the line of thought that connects the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature with positive aesthetics has also been debated.\nThe contention that untouched, pristine nature has only or primarily\npositive aesthetic qualities has been related to scientific\ncognitivism by suggesting that linking the appreciation of nature to\nscientific knowledge explains how positive aesthetic appreciation is\nnurtured by a scientific worldview that increasingly interprets the\nnatural world as having positive aesthetic qualities, such as order,\nbalance, unity, and harmony (Carlson 1984). Other philosophers either\nsee the relationship between scientific cognitivism and positive\naesthetics somewhat conversely, arguing that the latter should just be\nassumed, in which case it provides support for the former (Parsons\n2002), or simply contend that the positive aesthetics tradition\nactually has much earlier roots than contemporary scientific\ncognitivism (Phemister and Strickland 2015). Nonetheless, however it\nis justified, some versions of the positive aesthetics position are\nsupported by several environmental philosophers (Rolston 1988,\nHargrove 1989, Hettinger 2017, Cheng 2017a), while others find it\nproblematic, either since it appears to undercut the possibility of\nthe kind of comparative assessments thought to be necessary for\nenvironmental planning and preservation (Thompson 1995, Godlovitch\n1998a) or because the idea itself seems unintuitive, obscure, and/or\ninadequately justified (Godlovitch 1998b, Saito 1998a, Budd 2002,\nStecker 2012). Even philosophers who are somewhat open to the idea of\npositive aesthetics have some reservations about its original\nformulation, arguing that it depends too heavily on a now out-dated\nconception of ecology and/or does not adequately stress an\nevolutionary understanding of nature as an essential component of\naesthetic appreciation (Simus 2008a, Paden et al 2012, Paden\n2015a 2016). Such considerations may point to a more plausible version\nof positive aesthetics.\n",
