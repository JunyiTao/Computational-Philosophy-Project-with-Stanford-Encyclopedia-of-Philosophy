    "main_text": "Skeptical Ideas in Early and Classical Greek Philosophy || Plato\n2.2 Plato\n\nThe Socrates of Plato\u2019s Apology tries to solve a\npuzzle. The Delphic oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates.\nBut Socrates does not think himself wise. He calls into question the\ntruth of neither the oracle\u2019s pronouncements nor his\nself-perception. Accordingly, he must figure out how both are\nconsistent with each other. In order to do so, Socrates talks to\nvarious groups of experts in Athens: politicians, poets, and\ncraftsmen. As it turns out, all of them think that they know something\nabout great and important things, but in fact, it seems clear to\nSocrates, they do not. When asked they cannot provide reasons for\nbelieving the things they claim to know that are rationally\nsatisfactory. Socrates knows that he does not know about these most\nimportant matters (megista; 22d); his interlocutors, it\nappears, do not know that they lack this knowledge. In this respect,\nSocrates is wiser than everyone else who has any general reputation\nfor wisdom. In the course of recounting his conversations with others,\nSocrates says something enigmatic: \u201cAbout myself I knew that I\nknow nothing\u201d (22d; cf. Fine 2008). Some readers (ancient and\nmodern) take Socrates to profess that he knows nothing. But the\ncontext of the dialogue allows us to read his pronouncement as\nunproblematical. Socrates knows that he does not know about important\nthings. He advocates the importance of critically examining\none\u2019s own and others\u2019 views on important matters,\nprecisely because one does not know about them (Vogt 2012a, ch. 1).\nSuch examination is the only way to find out.\n\nSocrates\u2019 commitment to reason\u2014examination as the way to\nfind out\u2014inspires the skepticism of the Hellenistic Academy\n(Cooper 2004b, Vogt 2013). One is bound to lead one\u2019s life based\non one\u2019s beliefs, he assumes. Therefore, one ought to examine\none\u2019s beliefs, and abandon those that one finds to be false. One\nought to do so because otherwise one might lead a bad life.\nSocrates\u2019 questioning is rooted in a concern with the good life.\nInsofar as it is, one might think that the Socratic roots of ancient\nskepticism lead one toward a kind of limited, wholly moral skepticism.\nHowever, Socrates\u2019 examinations are not confined to value\nquestions. While ethical questions may be the starting-point, they\nimmediately lead to questions about the soul, the gods, knowledge, and\nso on. For Socrates and his Hellenistic followers, value questions\ncannot be insulated from questions of psychology, physics, and\nepistemology.\n\nAnother strand of skeptical thought begins with questions about the\nnature of philosophical investigation. In the Meno, Plato\nformulates a famous puzzle. How is investigation possible? We cannot\ninvestigate either what we know or what we do not know. In the former\ncase, there is no need to investigate, and besides, if we really do\nknow we already have in mind everything that investigation could\nreveal to us about the matter. In the latter case, we would not know\nwhat to look for, and we would not recognize it if we found it\n(80d-86c). So there is no room for investigating anything. Socrates\ncalls this an eristic argument, thus drawing attention to the fact\nthat this is a puzzle that sophists have put forward (cf.\nPlato\u2019s Euthydemus).\n\nPlato\u2019s solutions to this puzzle are difficult to assess (Fine\n2014). Learning is recollection, says one proposal (this is the one\nthat Socrates himself immediately offers). We already know, but only\nin some implicit way, what it takes investigation to come to know\nexplicitly. This is the famous Anamnesis theory (81a-d). If we give up\non investigation, we shall be lazy people, says another argument\n(81d-e). A third solution of the puzzle arguably says that one of its\npremises is false. It is not the case that, for everything, we either\nknow it or are entirely ignorant of it. Rather, there is a third\nstate, namely belief (83a-86a). Investigation can begin from\nbeliefs.\n\nThe Meno explores a mix of these solutions. Plato develops\nwhat he calls a hypothetical method (86c-100b). That is, the\ninterlocutors in some sense begin from their beliefs (for example,\n\u201cvirtue is good\u201d). But they do not endorse them. They set\nthem up as hypotheses, and employ these hypotheses in investigation\n(on the relationship between Pyrrhonian skepticism and Plato\u2019s\nand Aristotle\u2019s notions of hypothesis, cf. Corti 2011). A\nspurious dialogue, the Sisyphus, discusses a similar puzzle,\nthough with respect to deliberation. Deliberation either involves\nknowledge or is mere guesswork; either way, deliberation is\nimpossible. Here, too, we may ask whether the distinction between\nknowing and not knowing is exhaustive, or whether attention to belief\nchanges the picture (Fine 2021, ch. 8).\n\nPlato discusses and re-formulates several of the metaphysical\nconsiderations that back up proto-skeptical and early skeptical\nintuitions. The relevant passages are spread out over a number of\ndialogues, among which passages in the Phaedo,\nRepublic, Theaetetus and Timaeus are\nperhaps most important. In these dialogues, Plato develops some of his\nown metaphysical ideas. He also engages critically with metaphysical\ntheories that he does not ultimately adopt. However, in order to\nexplore these theories he formulates them in detail, often invoking a\nPre-Socratic ancestor as a proponent of a given idea. These\ndiscussions are a great source of inspiration for Pyrrhonian skeptics,\nwho are interested in what may be called a metaphysics of\nindeterminacy (Bett 2000, Vogt 2021).\n\nIn contrasting the Forms with the perceptible realm, Plato discusses\nproperties. For example, for all sensible items, A is tall\nrelative to some B and short relative to some C.\nThere is no such thing as anything\u2019s being tall\nsimpliciter. When we call something tall, we measure it\nagainst something else, look at it from a particular perspective, and\nso on. As we might say, \u201ctall\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d\nare relative predicates. But perhaps many more, or indeed all,\npredicates work that way, even where this is less obvious.\nPlato\u2019s arguments lead to the question of whether it is\nconceivable that all our predications are, in this particular sense,\nrelative. If this were the case, it might quite fundamentally upset\nour conception of the world as furnished with objects that have\nproperties. Such considerations lead to another idea about properties\nin the perceptual realm. If a fence is low and high, a cloud is bright\nand dark, a vase beautiful and ugly, and so on, then it seems that,\nperhaps quite generally, perceptual things are F and\nnot-F. Only the Form of F is F (for\nexample, only the Beautiful is beautiful). While the relevant passages\nare difficult to interpret, it is clear enough which line of thought\ncomes to influence later skeptics. The skeptics engage with the idea\nthat, if something appears to be F and not-F, it is\nnot really (or: by nature) either F or not-F.\n\nIn the Timaeus, Plato argues that an account of the natural\nworld can only be \u2018likely\u2019: it is an eik\u00f4s\nlogos. Most generally speaking, the idea here is that certain\nexplananda are such that theorizing about them can do no more than\nmirror their, comparatively speaking deficient, nature. This idea has\nancestors in Xenophanes and Parmenides, and it plays a crucial role in\nthe Timaeus (Bryan 2012). Academic skeptics employ various\nnotions of the plausible and the convincing, thus developing further\nthis tradition, albeit no longer with the assumption that different\ndomains require different kinds of theorizing.\n\nIn the Theaetetus, Plato explores the kind of cultural\nrelativism that is associated with some sophists. In his examination\nrelativism is extended to a general theory, not restricted to the\ndomain of values. Socrates (as main speaker of the dialogue) ascribes\nrelativism to Protagoras, who is famous for saying that \u201cman is\nthe measure.\u201d Socrates reformulates this claim as follows: what\nappears to A is true for A, and what appears to\nB is true for B. On this premise, Socrates argues,\nthere is no rational way to prefer our perceptions while awake to our\nperceptions while asleep, or similarly, to prefer sober to intoxicated\nor deranged perceptions. In each state, our perceptions are true for\nus. Socrates analyzes relativism in several steps, pointing to ever\nmore radical implications. Along the way, he envisages a moderate\nmetaphysics of flux, where objects do not have stable properties. But\neventually he points out that relativism is committed to an even\nstarker revisionist metaphysics, radical flux. For it to be possible\nthat what seems to A is true for A, and what seems\nto B is true for B, there cannot be a stable world\nthat A and B both refer to. Rather,\n\u201ceverything is motion\u201d (Tht. 179c-184b). The\nskeptics employ versions of some of the arguments in the\nTheaetetus, without, however, arriving at relativist\nconclusions. Schematically speaking, the relativist says that,\nif X is F for A and F*\nfor B, then X is F-for-A and\nF*-for-B. Pyrrhonian skepticism of the variant found\nin Sextus reacts by continued investigation into whether X is\nF or F* (or both or neither).\n",
