    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || Mersenne and Descartes on Eternal Truths\n3.4 Mersenne and Descartes on Eternal Truths\n\nMersenne did not extend his voluntarism to mathematical truths, as\nDescartes did in a rather unconventional way. The confrontation of\nMersenne\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s positions on this theme has\nbeen the object of some discussions in the secondary\nliterature\u2014see especially Marion 1980; Dear 1988; Carraud 1994;\nFabbri 2008. Descartes first assertions on God\u2019s creation of\nmathematical truths appeared in a letter to Mersenne of April 15,\n1630. Descartes enjoined his correspondent to tell everyone aloud that\nthe mathematical truths that Mersenne called eternal were not\nindependent of God, but \u201chave been created by him and depend on\nhim entirely just as do all the other creatures\u201d (Descartes to\nMersenne, April 15, 1630, AT I: 145). God freely established them, and\nimpressed them in the minds of men, as a king would in his kingdom.\nThe statement seems to have surprised Mersenne. The Minim\u2019s own\nletters are lost, but this can be inferred from the fact that\nDescartes in May and June 1630, obviously answers repeated requests\nfor clarification:\n\n\nyou ask me in quo genere causae Deus disposuit aeternas\nveritates [in what kind of cause God has disposed the eternal\ntruths]. I reply to you that it is in eodem genere causae [in\nthe same kind of cause] that he has created everything, that is ut\nefficients et totalis causa [as efficient and total cause].\n(Descartes to Mersenne, May 27 1630, AT I: 151\u20132).\n\nYou ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that\nhe was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are\nequal\u2014just as free as he was not to create the world. (27 mai\n1630, AT I: 152)\n\n\nMersenne\u2019s own considerations on the status of eternal truths in\nGod\u2019s intellect explain why he should have had qualms about\nDescartes\u2019s puzzling doctrine (which might amount here to no\nless than making mathematical truths somehow contingent, depending on\nthe arbitrary will of God\u2014even though Descartes himself, who\noften points out the necessity of mathematical truths, never draws\nsuch consequence). Mersenne position seems closer to cardinal de\nBerulle\u2019s, and Augustine\u2019s exemplarism: eternal\ntruths are exemplar ideas present in God\u2019s intellect and\nilluminating our own. They proceed from God\u2019s nature as His\nVerb, but they are not similar to creatures, they are not\n\u201cfreely\u201d created.\n\nWhen Mersenne considers God\u2019s relation to eternal truth he often\nuses metaphors of light and the emanatist vocabulary of\nNeo-Platonism\u2014for example in the Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019harmonie Universelle:\n\n\nI consider, therefore the divine essence as an eternal and infinite\nsun, which darts an infinity of rays on which depend all our\nperfections: the goodness of God is one of these rays, whence come\nour good inclinations, our virtues and our good works, the other is\neternal truth, whence proceed all our truths and our sciences. (THU:\n59\u201360, English translation in Dear 1988: 58)\n\n\nOr in the Questions th\u00e9ologiques:\n\nthe sciences are like the rays of divinity, and it is just as\nblameable to try to know them without God, than try to know the nature\nof colours, without knowing the nature of light, which gives them\nbeing and subsistence. (QT: 202)\n\nThe kind of causality implied here is a causality ad intra:\neternal truths belong to God\u2019s nature. And in this regard, as\nthey are \u201cformally\u201d in God and so to speak coeternal with\nHim, they should be considered as uncreated and necessitated, as God\nhimself is not free towards His own nature:\n\n\nIt is patent that God is entirely free in regard everything that are\ncontained only eminently in him, to produce them or not, as He is\ndriven necessarily to whatever he embraces formerly as these things\nthat are God himself are infinite, eternal, independent. (QG: col\n436)\n\n\nThe idea that eternal truths exist necessarily in God, and do not\ndepend on God\u2019s causality was not new, and Mersenne here\nbelonged to a rather well established scholastic tradition. An\noriginal feature of Mersenne\u2019s position however is that he\nconsidered mathematical truths as the very paradigm of eternal truths.\nAs pointed by Dear, this was not a received doctrine. Mathematics used\nto be considered not really worthy of the dignity of true sciences, on\naccount of the inessential nature of their object and the non-causal\ncharacter of their demonstrations. Mersenne, in the wake of Biancani\n(1615) defended the contrary view: mathematics are not only true\nsciences, but the highest among them, because of their certainty.\nBesides, their demonstrations are truly causal ones, as Mersenne\nshowed with the example of numbers where unity appears to be the\n\u201cmaterial cause\u201d and the intellect, conjoining and\ncomposing unities, the \u201cefficient\u201d one (cf. VS II: 284).\nThus mathematics is able to describe the objects that God\u2019s\nintellect considered when He created the world, that is the possibilia\n(Lenoble 1943)\u2014or, better said, mathematics are the sciences of\nthe metaphysically necessary attributes of all things.\n\nOne important question that has been debated in the literature is\nwhether Mersenne\u2019s position amounts to the idea that\nmathematical truths are truly independent of God. The discussion is\nnot merely about the meaning one is willing to give to the word\n\u201cindependent\u201d whether it applies or not to something that\nis included in God\u2019s nature, but it engages deep issues in the\nhistory of metaphysical thought. According to Marion (1980), and\nCarraud (1994), the very fact that mathematical truths are considered\nas forming the essence of God\u2019s intellect means that they do not\ndepend anymore on God\u2019s will. Apparently endorsing a doctrine\nthat he found mentioned in Su\u00e1rez (1597, xxxi.12.40), Mersenne\nwrote in a much discussed passage of the Quaestiones:\n\n\nas other authors say, things are possible per se, independently of any\ncause, in virtue of the necessary connection and non-contradiction of\nterms. (col. 436)\n\n\nGod would be subjected to mathematical truths just as human intellects\nare. He would know them as we know them. This would be the sign that\nthe doctrine of univocity entered Mersenne\u2019s thought, perhaps\nunder the influence of Kepler, in an irretrievable fashion. This is\nalso deemed to explain the striking disappearance of rational theology\nin Mersenne\u2019s writings. Just as metaphysics had been entirely\nexhausted by natural theology in the first works, rational theology\nended up being entirely exhausted by mathematics. The latter are not\nanymore an analogical resource for theology, but indeed they furnish\nthe only possible non-analogical discourse on God, \u201cthe hidden\nobject of all mathematical discourse\u201d (Pessel 1987). As a\nconsequence, Mersenne\u2019s apologetics no longer needs to appeal to\nrational theology\u2014the mere promotion of mathematical sciences\nhas become the unique, or best, apology of Christian religion.\n\nPeter Dear criticized Marion\u2019s interpretation as implying\nsomething that he did not find in Mersenne, namely that mathematical\ntruths exist in a kind of platonic separateness, so that God and men\nwould be in the same relation to them, would see them the same way.\nThis would imply that God is no more the author of them than men,\nwhereas in Dear\u2019s view, Mersenne, always firmly maintained that\neternal truths causally depend on God, being true emanations of his\nnature. Accordingly, Mersenne would not so much insist on independence\nbut rather on co-implication and coeternity. Whereas Descartes used\nto\n\n\nsee the matter as straight choice between necessary truths holding\nsimply because God knew them (having willed them) or God\u2019s\nknowing them because they are independently true. (cf. Descartes\n\u00e0 Mersenne 6 mai 1630, Descartes AT I: 149, and Dear 1988:\n60)\n\n\nMersenne, a rather orthodox scholastic on this point, never recognized\nan alternative: both theses should hold together\u2014eternal truths\nare true because God knows them, and God knows them because they are\ntrue.\n",
