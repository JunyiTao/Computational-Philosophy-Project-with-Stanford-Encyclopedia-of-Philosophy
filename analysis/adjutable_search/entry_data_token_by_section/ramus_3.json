    "main_text": "Ramist philosophy || Historical context\n2.1 Historical context\n\nThe enormous impact of Ramus on European education in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries has seemed astonishing to some modern\nscholars; and among his harshest critics have been historians of\nlogic. Carl Prantl, for instance, claimed that Ramus had no talent\nwhatsoever for philosophy and logic (Prantl 1855\u20131870:\n157\u2013169; cf. Kneale and Kneale 1962: 300\u2013302); and Walter\nJ. Ong was also keen to point out his incompetence (Ong 1958: 7 and\n24). Without engaging in arguments with these scholars, it is still\nlegitimate to ask what it was that made Ramus so popular and so\ncontroversial. One key to understanding the impact of Ramism can be\nfound in his own statement, in the Scholae dialecticae, that\nthe aim of his reforms was to adapt Aristotle\u2019s Organon\nto the service of learning, ad eruditionis usum.\n\nThe arts faculty was supposed to prepare young students for further\nstudies in theology, medicine or jurisprudence. Most students,\nhowever, never advanced to these higher faculties but left the\nuniversity for employment in the Church. The arts curriculum had been\ngeared toward this situation since the Middle Ages. The political\ndevelopments which led to the rise of a new kind of state in the\nRenaissance also affected the educational program of universities. In\nthe short term, rulers tried to find quick and practical solutions\nsuch as special colleges or special professorships; but in the long\nrun, more thorough measures, which included establishing new\ninstitutions and devising new curricula, were needed. The arts faculty\nhad gradually changed, and what we now call the humanities (history,\nliterature, rhetoric and ethics) had started to play a more important\nrole. The stress on some aspects of logic and metaphysics,\ncharacteristic of the medieval arts faculty, was becoming obsolete. A\nnew curriculum adjusted to the humanities was therefore necessary.\n\nRamus was most concerned about the obvious lack of efficiency of the\nscholastic curriculum that he had observed as a student. According to\nhim, students had to spend too many years learning too little of use\nfor them. He adopted as his motto a famous line by Vergil\n\u201cLabor improbus omnia vincit\u201d (Relentless work\novercomes everything; Georgics 1.145). From his own\nexperience, he knew the importance of hard work, and he wanted to make\nit possible for students of more humble means to study and, by\ndiligent application, reach their goals more quickly. Therefore, he\nneeded to make education much cheaper by shortening the amount of time\nstudents put into studying. To achieve this, he had to reflect on the\npedagogical means and goals (Hotson 2007: 39\u201351).\n",
