In setting the problem up we assumed that\nearlier Cup consists of the following parts: a handle together with\nTcup. That assumption is justified if the following is. Tcup existed\nas a part of Cup when Cup still had its handle. Van Inwagen would\nreject that assumption. According to him it is illegitimate to assume\nthat any old way of notionally dividing up an object yields an\nexisting undetached part.\n\nInstead of denying that Tcup exists at t1 when it\nis ostensibly a proper part of Cup, we might instead deny that Tcup at\nt1 is identical with what looks very much like\nTcup at t2. In this way we can preserve\ntransitivity without having to identify the earlier cup with one of\nits proper parts.\n\nOne way to allow that Tcup earlier exists without conceding its later\nidentity with Cup is, following Michael Burke, to maintain that Tcup\ngoes out of existence when Cup loses its handle (see Burke 1994).\n",
