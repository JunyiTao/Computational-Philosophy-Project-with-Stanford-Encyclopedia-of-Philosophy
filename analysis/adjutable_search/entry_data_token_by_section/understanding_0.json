Contexts\n\nThe concept of understanding has been sometimes prominent, sometimes\nneglected, and sometimes viewed with suspicion, across a number of\ndifferent areas of philosophy (for a partial overview, see Zagzebski\n2001). This section traces some of that background, beginning with the\nplace of understanding in Ancient Greek philosophy. It then considers\nhow the topic of understanding was lost and then\n\u201crecovered\u201d in contemporary discussions in epistemology\nand the philosophy of science.\n",
