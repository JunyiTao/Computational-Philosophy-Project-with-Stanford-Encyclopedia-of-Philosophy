    "main_text": "Translations Into Many-sorted Logic with a Second-order Appearance || General Plan\n5.1 General Plan\n\nAs mentioned already, in Henkin 1953 a new calculus for second order\nlogic was defined by eliminating some Substitution Rules from\nthe calculus presented in Church\n 1956[20]\n and introducing Comprehension Schema. In this paper, Henkin\ndefines two calculi \\(F^{\\ast}\\) and \\(F^{\\ast \\ast}\\) (basically,\ncalculi MSL and SOL): the first one is obtained from a first-order\ncalculus by adding rules for the new quantifiers, while the second is\na proper second-order calculus. Both calculi are incomplete with\nstandard semantics. Henkin mentioned that we can obtain a completeness\nresult for the \\(F^{\\ast}\\) calculus with the frame\nsemantics. In fact, we have already seen completeness for MSL and\nthat the second-order calculus is complete with the general\nsemantics.\n\nThere is another interesting idea, appearing explicitly in the 1953\npaper, which is also useful. The idea is: If we weaken comprehension,\nwe obtain a calculus between \\(F^{\\ast}\\) and \\(F^{\\ast \\ast}\\). And\nit is easy to find a semantics for the logic thus defined. Of course,\nthis class of structures is placed between \\(\\mathfrak{F}\\) and\n\\(\\mathfrak{GS}\\). The new logic, call it \\(\\XL\\), will also be\ncomplete; the main reason being that this class of models is again\naxiomatizable.\n\nIn what follows, this idea is exploited in several propositional modal\nlogics as well as in propositional dynamic logic with Kripke\nsemantics (see the entry on\n modal logic\n as well as the entry on\n propositional dynamic logic).\n\nThe second-order appearance mentioned in the title is as follows: when\ndefining the conversion of structures into MSL we will add new\nuniverses containing all the categories of mathematical objects you\ncan talk about in PML (or PDL); therefore, we add all sets and\nrelations defined in these logics with their respective formulas and\nprograms. And so, we are somehow shifting to SOL structures. We can\nadd as well membership relation symbols to the language and membership\nrelations to the structures, as we did in the conversion of SOL into\nMSL; we will end up in MSL but the inspiration is SOL.\n",
