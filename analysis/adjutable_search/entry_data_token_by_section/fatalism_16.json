    "main_text": "Theological Fatalism: Pike\u2019s argument and God\u2019s omniscience || Affecting the past\n5.3 Affecting the past\n\nOne possible solution is to suggest that Pike\u2019s second\nalternative is possible, without any appeal to softness of facts.\nAccording to this solution, in some cases people have the power do\nthings which are inconsistent with the actual facts about the past,\neven though they are hard facts. That is to say, in some cases people\nhave the power to affect the past. In particular the suggestion is\nthat Jones had the power to do something which would have brought it\nabout that God did not believe in 1900 that he would mow the lawn\n(Anglin 1990). The plausibility of such a solution will depend largely\non the strength of the arguments for the impossibility of affecting\nthe past.\n\nNow some such arguments seek merely to demonstrate this impossibility\nwithout offering any further explanation for it. And it may be\ncontended that most of the arguments of this sort which are at all\ncompelling involve appealing to the obvious impossibility that an\nevent might prevent its own occurrence, and to the slightly less\nobvious impossibility that an event might bring about its own\noccurrence. But, in reply to such arguments, it may be claimed that\nthese impossibilities are not sufficient to rule out the possibility\nthat one event might bring about an earlier event, as long as the\nworld is so organised as to avoid these impossible outcomes. If so, it\nis not clear why God should not have so organised it. And in\nparticular it is not clear why God should not have so organised things\nthat it is possible for us to do things which affect what beliefs he\nholds.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, other arguments for the impossibility of\naffecting the past go further, and incorporate an explanation for the\nimpossibility. A successful defence against theological fatalism which\nappealed to the possibility of affecting the past would have to deal\nwith these further issues.\n",
