Globalization in Contemporary Social Theory\n\nSince the mid-1980s, social theorists have moved beyond the relatively\nunderdeveloped character of previous reflections on the compression or\nannihilation of space to offer a rigorous conception of globalization.\nTo be sure, major disagreements remain about the precise nature of the\ncausal forces behind globalization, with David Harvey (1989 1996)\nbuilding directly on Marx\u2019s pioneering explanation of\nglobalization, while others (Giddens 19990; Held, McGrew, Goldblatt\n& Perraton 1999) question the exclusive focus on economic factors\ncharacteristic of the Marxist approach. Nonetheless, a consensus about\nthe basic rudiments of the concept of globalization appears to be\nemerging.\n\nFirst, recent analysts associate globalization with\ndeterritorialization, according to which a growing variety of\nsocial activities takes place irrespective of the geographical\nlocation of participants. As Jan Aart Scholte observes, \u201cglobal\nevents can \u2013 via telecommunication, digital computers,\naudiovisual media, rocketry and the like \u2013 occur almost\nsimultaneously anywhere and everywhere in the world\u201d (Scholte\n1996, 45). Globalization refers to increased possibilities for action\nbetween and among people in situations where latitudinal and\nlongitudinal location seems immaterial to the social activity at hand.\nEven though geographical location remains crucial for many\nundertakings (for example, farming to satisfy the needs of a local\nmarket), deterritorialization manifests itself in many social spheres.\nBusiness people on different continents now engage in electronic\ncommerce; academics make use of the latest Internet conferencing\nequipment to organize seminars in which participants are located at\ndisparate geographical locations; the Internet allows people to\ncommunicate instantaneously with each other notwithstanding vast\ngeographical distances separating them. Territory in the sense of a\ntraditional sense of a geographically identifiable location no longer\nconstitutes the whole of \u201csocial space\u201d in which human\nactivity takes places. In this initial sense of the term,\nglobalization refers to the spread of new forms of non-territorial\nsocial activity (Ruggie 1993; Scholte 2000).\n\nSecond, theorists conceive of globalization as linked to the growth of\nsocial interconnectedness across existing geographical and\npolitical boundaries. In this view, deterritorialization is a crucial\nfacet of globalization. Yet an exclusive focus on it would be\nmisleading. Since the vast majority of human activities is still tied\nto a concrete geographical location, the more decisive facet of\nglobalization concerns the manner in which distant events and forces\nimpact on local and regional endeavors (Tomlinson 1999, 9). For\nexample, this encyclopedia might be seen as an example of a\ndeterritorialized social space since it allows for the exchange of\nideas in cyberspace. The only prerequisite for its use is access to\nthe Internet. Although substantial inequalities in Internet access\nstill exist, use of the encyclopedia is in principle unrelated to any\nspecific geographical location. However, the reader may very well be\nmaking use of the encyclopedia as a supplement to course work\nundertaken at a school or university. That institution is not only\nlocated at a specific geographical juncture, but its location is\nprobably essential for understanding many of its key attributes: the\nlevel of funding may vary according to the state or region where the\nuniversity is located, or the same academic major might require\ndifferent courses and readings at a university in China, for example,\nthan in Argentina or Norway. Globalization refers to those processes\nwhereby geographically distant events and decisions impact to a\ngrowing degree on \u201clocal\u201d university life. For example,\nthe insistence by powerful political leaders in wealthy countries that\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank recommend to Latin\nand South American countries that they commit themselves to a\nparticular set of economic policies might result in poorly paid\nteachers and researchers as well as large, understaffed lecture\nclasses in S\u00e3o Paolo or Lima; the latest innovations in\ninformation technology from a computer research laboratory in India\ncould quickly change the classroom experience of students in British\nColumbia or Tokyo. Globalization refers \u201cto processes of change\nwhich underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs\nby linking together and expanding human activity across regions and\ncontinents\u201d (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999, 15).\nGlobalization in this sense is a matter of degree since any given\nsocial activity might influence events more or less faraway: even\nthough a growing number of activities seems intermeshed with events in\ndistant continents, certain human activities remain primarily local or\nregional in scope. Also, the magnitude and impact of the activity\nmight vary: geographically removed events could have a relatively\nminimal or a far more extensive influence on events at a particular\nlocality. Finally, we might consider the degree to which\ninterconnectedness across frontiers is no longer merely haphazard but\ninstead predictable and regularized (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt &\nPerraton 1999).\n\nThird, globalization must also include reference to the speed\nor velocity of social activity. Deterritorialization and\ninterconnectedness initially seem chiefly spatial in nature. Yet it is\neasy to see how these spatial shifts are directly tied to the\nacceleration of crucial forms of social activity. As we observed above\nin our discussion of the conceptual forerunners to the present-day\ndebate on globalization, the proliferation of high-speed\ntransportation, communication, and information technologies\nconstitutes the most immediate source for the blurring of geographical\nand territorial boundaries that prescient observers have diagnosed at\nleast since the mid-nineteenth century. The compression of space\npresupposes rapid-fire forms of technology; shifts in our experiences\nof territory depend on concomitant changes in the temporality of human\naction. High-speed technology only represents the tip of the iceberg,\nhowever. The linking together and expanding of social activities\nacross borders is predicated on the possibility of relatively fast\nflows and movements of people, information, capital, and goods.\nWithout these fast flows, it is difficult to see how distant events\ncould possibly posses the influence they now enjoy. High-speed\ntechnology plays a pivotal role in the velocity of human affairs. But\nmany other factors contribute to the overall pace and speed of social\nactivity. The organizational structure of the modern capitalist\nfactory offers one example; certain contemporary habits and\ninclinations, including the \u201cmania for motion and speed\u201d\ndescribed by Dewey, represent another. Deterritorialization and the\nexpansion of interconnectedness are intimately tied to the\nacceleration of social life, while social acceleration itself takes\nmany different forms (Eriksen 2001; Rosa 2013). Here as well, we can\neasily see why globalization is always a matter of degree. The\nvelocity or speed of flows, movements, and interchanges across borders\ncan vary no less than their magnitude, impact, or regularity.\n\nFourth, even though analysts disagree about the causal forces that\ngenerate globalization, most agree that globalization should be\nconceived as a relatively long-term process. The triad of\ndeterritorialization, interconnectedness, and social acceleration\nhardly represents a sudden or recent event in contemporary social\nlife. Globalization is a constitutive feature of the modern world, and\nmodern history includes many examples of globalization (Giddens 1990).\nAs we saw above, nineteenth-century thinkers captured at least some of\nits core features; the compression of territoriality composed an\nimportant element of their lived experience. Nonetheless, some\ncontemporary theorists believe that globalization has taken a\nparticularly intense form in recent decades, as innovations in\ncommunication, transportation, and information technologies (for\nexample, computerization) have generated stunning new possibilities\nfor simultaneity and instantaneousness (Harvey 1989). In this view,\npresent-day intellectual interest in the problem of globalization can\nbe linked directly to the emergence of new high-speed technologies\nthat tend to minimize the significance of distance and heighten\npossibilities for deterritorialization and social interconnectedness.\nAlthough the intense sense of territorial compression experienced by\nso many of our contemporaries is surely reminiscent of the experiences\nof earlier generations, some contemporary writers nonetheless argue\nthat it would be mistaken to obscure the countless ways in which\nongoing transformations of the spatial and temporal contours of human\nexperience are especially far-reaching. While our nineteenth-century\npredecessors understandably marveled at the railroad or the telegraph,\na comparatively vast array of social activities is now being\ntransformed by innovations that accelerate social activity and\nconsiderably deepen longstanding trends towards deterritorialization\nand social interconnectedness. To be sure, the impact of\ndeterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and social\nacceleration are by no means universal or uniform: migrant workers\nengaging in traditional forms of low-wage agricultural labor in the\nfields of southern California, for example, probably operate in a\ndifferent spatial and temporal context than the Internet entrepreneurs\nof San Francisco or Seattle. Distinct assumptions about space and time\noften coexist uneasily during a specific historical juncture (Gurvitch\n1964). Nonetheless, the impact of recent technological innovations is\nprofound, and even those who do not have a job directly affected by\nthe new technology are shaped by it in innumerable ways as citizens\nand consumers (Eriksen 2001, 16).\n\nFifth, globalization should be understood as a multi-pronged\nprocess, since deterritorialization, social interconnectedness, and\nacceleration manifest themselves in many different (economic,\npolitical, and cultural) arenas of social activity. Although each\nfacet of globalization is linked to the core components of\nglobalization described above, each consists of a complex and\nrelatively autonomous series of empirical developments, requiring\ncareful examination in order to disclose the causal mechanisms\nspecific to it (Held, McGrew, Goldblatt & Perraton 1999). Each\nmanifestation of globalization also generates distinct conflicts and\ndislocations. For example, there is substantial empirical evidence\nthat cross-border flows and exchanges (of goods, people, information,\netc.), as well as the emergence of directly transnational forms of\nproduction by means of which a single commodity is manufactured\nsimultaneously in distant corners of the globe, are gaining in\nprominence (Castells 1996). High-speed technologies and organizational\napproaches are employed by transnationally operating firms, the\nso-called \u201cglobal players,\u201d with great effectiveness. The\nemergence of \u201caround-the-world, around-the-clock\u201d\nfinancial markets, where major cross-border financial transactions are\nmade in cyberspace at the blink of an eye, represents a familiar\nexample of the economic face of globalization. Global financial\nmarkets also challenge traditional attempts by liberal democratic\nnation-states to rein in the activities of bankers, spawning\nunderstandable anxieties about the growing power and influence of\nfinancial markets over democratically elected representative\ninstitutions. In political life, globalization takes a distinct form,\nthough the general trends towards deterritorialization,\ninterconnectedness across borders, and the acceleration of social\nactivity are fundamental here as well. Transnational movements, in\nwhich activists employ rapid-fire communication technologies to join\nforces across borders in combating ills that seem correspondingly\ntransnational in scope (for example, the depletion of the ozone\nlayer), offer an example of political globalization (Tarrow 2005).\nAnother would be the tendency towards ambitious supranational forms of\nsocial and economic lawmaking and regulation, where individual\nnation-states cooperate to pursue regulation whose jurisdiction\ntranscends national borders no less than the cross-border economic\nprocesses that undermine traditional modes of nation state-based\nregulation. Political scientists typically describe such supranational\norganizations (the European Union, for example, or United\nStates-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA) as important manifestations\nof political and legal globalization. The proliferation of\nsupranational organizations has been no less conflict-laden than\neconomic globalization, however. Critics insist that local, regional,\nand national forms of self-government are being supplanted by\ninsufficiently democratic forms of global governance remote from the\nneeds of ordinary citizens (Maus 2006; Streeck 2016). In contrast,\ndefenders describe new forms of supranational legal and political\ndecision as indispensable forerunners to more inclusive and advanced\nforms of self-government, even as they worry about existing democratic\ndeficits and technocratic traits (Habermas 2015).\n",
