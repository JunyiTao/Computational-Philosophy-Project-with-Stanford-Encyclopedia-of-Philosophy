    "main_text": "Bioethics and High Moral Theory\n3. Bioethics and High Moral Theory\n\nAs the discipline we now call bioethics emerged in the early 1970s,\nmoral philosophers and political theorists were primed to contribute\nto debates on any number of practical issues in areas such as law,\neconomics, the environment, business, research on human beings, and\nmedical practice. These academics were understandably hopeful both\nthat their knowledge of moral theory would prepare them to apply their\ntheoretical understanding to real-world problems, and that their\nskills in critical analysis would be appreciated. Even today, such\nconfidence in the usefulness of moral theory to the solving of\npractical problems is manifest in the introductions to bioethics\ntextbooks, many of which include discussions of at least the basics of\nconsequentialism, virtue theory, deontology, and so on.\n",
