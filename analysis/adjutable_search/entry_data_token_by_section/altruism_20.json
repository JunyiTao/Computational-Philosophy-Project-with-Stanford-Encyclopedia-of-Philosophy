    "main_text": "Sentimentalism revisited\n7. Conclusion\n\nWe have found no reason to doubt that we both can and should be\naltruistic to some extent. To what extent? Utilitarians and\nconsequentialists have an exact answer to that question: one is to\ngive equal weight to the good of every human being (or every sentient\ncreature), counting oneself as just one small part of that universal\ngood. If that is more altruism than can be required of us, the better\nalternative is not to retreat to the other extreme (egoism). Rather,\nhow much altruism is appropriate for an individual varies according to\nthat individual\u2019s situation in life.\n\nAltruism is not necessarily admirable. It is to be admired only in\ncircumstances in which it is appropriate to act for another\u2019s\nsake\u2014and only when what one aims to do for another really does\nbenefit that individual. If one seeks what one takes to be the good of\nothers for their sake, but is mistaken about what is really good for\nthem, one\u2019s action is defective. Altruism is fully admirable\nonly when combined with a correct understanding of well-being.\n\nWhat is wrong with those who do not care about others for their sake?\nIt could be the case that such individuals are themselves worse off\nfor their lack of altruistic motivation. That is what a eudaimonist\nmust say, and we have not objected to that aspect of eudaimonism. It\ncould also be the case that there is a failure of rationality among\nthose who are never altruistic or insufficiently altruistic. But it\nshould not be assumed that there must be something else that goes awry\nin those who are not altruistic or not altruistic enough, beyond the\nfact that when they ought to have cared about some individual other\nthan themselves, they failed to do so.\n",
