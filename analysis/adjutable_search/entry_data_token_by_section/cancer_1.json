    "main_text": "Defining and Classifying Cancer || Cancer\u2019s Intrinsic Heterogeneity\n1.1 Cancer\u2019s Intrinsic Heterogeneity\n\nThe hope that molecular signature will address these classification\nproblems in part inspired international efforts at sequencing cancer\ngenomes \u2013 the Sanger Institute\u2019s Cancer Genome Project,\nand the U.S.\u2019s Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA). Such projects\nuse high-throughput genome sequencing to identify both inherited and\nsomatically acquired mutations to genes affected in cancer cells, as\nwell as mutational processes and patterns of clonal evolution. The\nTCGA aimed at generating a catalogue of mutations distinctive to of\neach cancer type and subtype, resulting in thirty-three\n\u201cmarker\u201d papers, and some novel subclassifications. For\nexample, in 2015, a working group affiliated with TCGA published a\n\u201cComprehensive Genomic Characterization of Head and Neck\nSquamous Cell Carcinomas,\u201d which identified specific mutations\nassociated with human-papillomavirus-associated versus smoking-related\nhead and neck cancers. While such projects did result in a more\ncomprehensive understanding of cancer biology, they also raised many\nquestions. Cancer genomes have many mutations, so a central puzzle has\nbeen determining which among the many changes to cancer genomes are\ncausally relevant to cancer progression, or which mutations are\n\u201cdrivers\u201d of cancer. Sorting the \u201csignal\u201d from\nthe noise has proven more difficult than anticipated.\n\nThere are very different rates, numbers and types of mutations across\nand within different cancer types and subtypes \u2013 what is called\n\u201cintertumor heterogeneity.\u201d Which mutations play a more\nsignificant causal role, viz. which outcome in different cancers, over\nthe course of cancer progression, is a difficult puzzle to solve. In\npart as a result of this, the concepts of \u201cdriver\nmutation\u201d and \u201cactionability\u201d have come to be\ndeployed quite differently in different contexts, leading to problems\nof slippage between criteria of application in research and clinical\ncontexts (Chin-Yee and Plutynski, forthcoming). Complicating this\nfurther, a cancer may contain several subpopulations of cells (or,\nmultiple evolving lineages), with different numbers and types of\nmutations within each lineage. Or, cancers have varying types and\ndegrees of \u201cintratumor heterogeneity.\u201d So, samples of a\ntumor taken when cancer is first diagnosed may be representative of\nonly one subpopulation of one stage of a dynamic process. Such samples\nmay not be representative of the genomic changes of greatest relevance\nto late-stage disease. \n\nAll this would be challenging enough as it is, but there is a yet\nfurther challenge facing hierarchical subclassifications of cancer\nbased on molecular information. Cancers arising in the same tissue or\norgan can be more genetically dissimilar than cancers arising in\ndifferent tissues or organs (Hoadley, et. al., 2014, 2018). Genomic\ninformation, far from providing a way to sort all cancers into a\nLinnean hierarchy, instead yields what philosophers have called\ncross-cutting classifications (Khalidi, 1998).\n\nMoreover, the effects of mutations are context-dependent, making their\ncausal relevance to any given cancer difficult to discern. Some\nmutations may provide low or no advantage to the mutated cells, until\nconditions change, such as the application of chemotherapies, which\ncan lead to proliferation of cells with specific mutations (Hsu et al.\n2018). Even the order of acquisition of mutations can change the\nbiology and outcome of the disease. For example, depending on which of\ntwo genes was first mutated, patients with myeloproliferative\nneoplasms (MPN) have different risks of different outcomes (Ortmann et\nal. NEJM 2015; Kent and Green 2017).\n\nSeveral \u201cextra-genomic\u201d factors also play an important\nrole in cancer causation and thus, arguably, ought to play at least a\npartial role in informing cancer taxonomy. For instance, it turns out\nchanges in microRNA in cancer cells\u2014non-coding RNA, which\naffects the expression of genes\u2014can affect cancer initiation,\nprogression, and responses to drugs (Hrovatin, et al. 2018). Life\nhistory (e.g. parity, or number of children, and age at first birth),\nenvironmental exposures, and histories of infection, and immune\nresponse, contribute differentially to cancer\u2019s age of onset,\nrate of progression, histopathology, and response to treatment. For\ninstance, infectious agents (e.g., HPV- or HCV-) are associated with\ncervical and liver cancers, and some proportion of esophageal cancers\n(Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Morgan, 2022). Indeed, for several\ndecades, the primary cause of cancer was thought to be viral, and\ninquiry into viral origins of cancer in part led to many insights into\ncancer causation, whether originating in viruses or not (see, e.g.,\nMorgan, 2022). Cancers of the prostate and breast are associated with\nhormones, which are in turn affected by parity.\n\u201cPregnancy-associated\u201d breast cancers are cancers that\narise during or shortly after pregnancy (see, e.g., Schedin 2006). The\n\u201csame\u201d cancer in the same tissue or organ can be\nclassified as either \u201csomatic,\u201d or\n\u201cfamilial\u201d\u2014due in part to whether the patient\npossesses inherited mutations that raise a risk of some cancers, such\nas those with Li Fraumeni syndrome. Smoking associated lung cancers\nand non-smoking associated lung cancers are distinct genetically,\nepigenetically, and phenotypically (e.g., in gross pathology, course\nof progression, as well as response to treatment).\n\nWhich of these several causal factors ought to figure centrally in\nclassification? Depending upon how fine-grained a characterization of\nthe causal basis of cancer one adopts, there could be hundreds or\nthousands of cancer types and subtypes. It\u2019s far from clear\nwhether there is one obvious choice of causal basis or distinctive\nproperties that best reflects anything like a \u201cnatural\u201d\ndivision of type and subtypes. Indeed, the case of cancer raises the\nlarger question of whether one can or should expect a univocal\nclassification of diseases, more generally. Are diseases, particularly\nmultifactorial ones such as cancer, \u201cnatural\u201d kinds? Or,\nare they simply ways of carving up the world that we happen to find\nuseful? \n\nSeveral philosophers have weighed in on these matters (see, e.g.,\nEreshefsky & Reydon 2015; Lange 2007; Broadbent 2009 and 2014;\nWilliams 2011; Khalidi 2013; Sorenson 2011, Bechtel, 2019). The\nquestions these authors are addressing are both epistemic\u2014what\nwarrants choice of criteria of classification of disease\u2014and\nmetaphysical\u2014given diseases like cancer lack essential\nproperties (or, properties belonging all and only to each type), is it\ncorrect to think of diseases as \u201cnatural kinds\u201d? Such\ndebates turn on more fundamental questions, such as whether there are\nany general criteria for \u201cnaturalness\u201d of scientific\ncategories, and if so, whether to take underlying causal or\nconstitutive bases, mechanisms, networks, or mere similarity or\n\u201cfeature matching\u201d as sufficient (Slater, 2014; Bechtel,\n2019; Boniolo, et. al., 2021; Boniolo et al., 2023). \n\nSome philosophers have expressed skepticism about whether cancer, or\nindeed, diseases, per se, are natural kinds. Lange (2007) for\ninstance, argues that, \u201ca disease is a natural kind of\nincapacity that features in interesting function-analytic explanations\nof other unhealthful incapacities\u201d(Lange, 2007, 266). Thus,\ncancer is not a \u201cnatural kind,\u201d in his view, because the\n\u201ctypical patterns of disruption of cell birth and death\u201d\ncharacteristic of cancer are multiply realized. Lange claims that\ninsofar as categories like \u201cbreast cancer\u201d or \u201clung\ncancer\u201d seem to be increasingly replaced in modern medicine by\nmolecular subtyping, and molecular subtypes are not \u201cnatural\nkinds of incapacity,\u201d they are not distinct diseases. Indeed,\nmany \u201cdisease kinds\u201d lack unifying\n\u201cfunction-analytic\u201d explanations. Thus, modern medicine\nhas, in a sense, led to the \u201cend of diseases\u201d as natural\nkinds. In a similar vein, but for very different reasons, Sorenson\n(2011) argues that diseases are \u201cpara-natural\u201d kinds.\nInsofar as diseases are \u201cdeficiencies,\u201d or\n\u201cdepartures from the norm,\u201d they lack the\n\u201cintegrity\u201d or \u201cinternal nature\u201d\ncharacteristic of natural kinds. Sorenson thus suggests that diseases\nare \u201creflections\u201d of natural kinds of process. They\n\u201cinherit the lawfulness and projectability of the natural kinds\nthat shape them.\u201d In other words, both Lange and Sorenson seem\nsimilarly skeptical that diseases like cancer have the integrity or\nexplanatory role of natural kinds.\n\nIn contrast, while Broadbent (2009, 2014), Williams (2011), and\nKhalidi (2013) agree that diseases like cancer lack essential\nproperties, disease classifications are natural classifications,\ninsofar as they pick out distinctive \u201cdeviations from normal\nfunctional ability,\u201d or homeostatic property clusters.\nBroadbent\u2019s (2009, 2014) \u201ccontrastive\u201d model of\ndisease classification takes diseases to be distinct in light of\ndistinctive causes. Where there is a difference in at least one of a\nset of causes shared by \u201ccontrols\u201d and \u201ccases\u201d\n(where cases have distinct \u201cparts and processes deviating\n(negatively) from normal functional ability\u201d), we have a\ndistinct disease. Broadbent takes this account to explain why, for\ninstance, \u201ccervical cancer is a disease, but HPV-itis is\nnot.\u201d Though, this case raises an interesting question as to\nwhether potential, rather than overt, dysfunction is more central to\ndisease classification. In public health contexts, it is often\nimportant to control \u201casymptomatic,\u201d or potentially\ndysfunctional states. Strains of HPV that do not currently cause\ncancer could well evolve the capacity to do so. So, perhaps from a\npublic health perspective, \u201cHPV-itis\u201d is a perfectly\nlegitimate disease category, in service of deploying interventions\nthat limit the spread of HPV more generally. That is, from a\npreventive medicine perspective, what matters is that a disease\ncategory is a good one for predicting and intervening, even where\nfunctional disruption does not always (or even most of the time)\neventuate. Which choice of classification we ought to make in\ndemarcating disease types might depend not only on which contrast we\nare interested in explaining retrospectively, but also which kind of\nintervention we wish to promote prospectively.\n\nKhalidi (2013) argues that cancer might be a homeostatic property\ncluster kind, on the grounds that cancer is driven by\n\u201chomeostatic\u201d mechanisms\u2014namely, mutations to\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d genes, or genes that play a\n\u201cgatekeeping\u201d role in preventing or permitting the\nemergence of a tumor. Acquisition of mutations to specific\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d genes, on this view, serve a function akin to\nBoyd\u2019s (1999) \u201chomeostatic mechanisms,\u201d in that they\npermit the further acquisition of \u201challmark\u201d properties of\ncancer cells. Khalidi is drawing upon a very common view of cancer,\narticulated by two famous cancer researchers, Hanahan and Weinberg\n(2000, 2011). They identify what they take to be the\n\u201challmarks\u201d of cancer: \u201ca small number of molecular,\nbiochemical, and cellular traits\u2014acquired\ncapabilities\u2014shared by most and perhaps all types of human\ncancer.\u201d They identified these \u201csix essential alterations\nin cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth\u201d\nas: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth\nsignals, evasion of apoptosis (cell death), sustained angiogenesis\n(the ability to develop a blood supply), tissue invasion and\nmetastasis (Hanahan & Weinberg 2000, 57). By way of example of a\ncaretaker, TP53 is called a tumor suppressor, because it\ncarries the function of responding to signals associated with cell\ndamage by typically inducing apoptosis, or cell death. It is one of\nthe only genes mutated in a majority of cancers sequenced (Bailey, et\nal. 2018). Thus, Weinberg (2013) characterizes it as \u201cmaster\nguardian and executioner,\u201d in that it prevents further mutations\nby inducing cell death where there are signs of trouble. On\nKhalidi\u2019s view, one ought to understand disruption of these very\ncapacities as \u201chomeostatic mechanisms\u201d for cancer.\n\nAt first blush, this seems a vivid case of a homeostatic property\ncluster kind; on Khalidi\u2019s view, it is these distinctive\n\u201ccaretaker\u201d mutations that permit or promote cancer.\nHowever, where we take a mechanism \u201cfor cancer\u201d to begin\nand end is in large part a pragmatic matter (Craver 2009); arguably,\none might carve up the \u201chomeostatic mechanisms for\u201d cancer\nto yield many or few cancer subtypes (Plutynski, 2018). Hanahan and\nWeinberg\u2019s initial picture has been complicated since 2001. In\n2011, Hanahan and Weinberg updated their hallmarks to include four\nmore: \u201cgenome instability, which generates the genetic diversity\nthat expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters\nmultiple hallmark functions\u2026 reprogramming of energy\nmetabolism, and evading immune destruction.\u201d And, \u201cIn\naddition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of\ncomplexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal\ncells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by\ncreating the tumor microenvironment\u201d (2011, 646). In other\nwords, hallmarks of cancer appear to no longer involve all and only\nintrinsic properties of cancer cells, but also dynamic interactions\nbetween cancer cells and the immune system and extra-tumor\nenvironment. This may not be such a serious challenge to\nKhalidi\u2019s view that caretaker mutation are mechanisms for\ncancer. One could, arguably, just expand the mechanisms for\nhomeostasis to the tumor microenvironment. However, such a strategy is\ncomplicated by the context-sensitivity of causes of cancer, discussed\nabove. Many cells on the surface of the skin as we age possess as many\nmutations to \u201ccaretaker\u201d genes as those in a breast tumor,\nbut most such skin cells are shed and never eventuate in disease\n(Martincorena, et al. 2015). The \u201csame\u201d mechanisms may\nwell lead to harm in one context, and be entirely harmless in\nanother.\n\nSeveral recent efforts at cancer classification use network,\n\u201cdeep learning\u201d methods or AI to mine data to identify\npatterns of association or clusters of common features within and\nacross different cancer types. These methods have been used to address\nthe so-called \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d problem: i.e.,\nsort through enormous amounts of genomic data, and speed development\nof tools for both diagnosis and treatment. Recent philosophical work\nexplores a variety of methodological and conceptual challenges facing\nuse these methods. While some are optimistic about the use of such\ntools in classification of cancers and other diseases, others are more\nskeptical (Boniolo & Nathan, 2016; Boniolo and Campagner, 2019a,\n2019b; Bechtel, 2019; Shrager, et. al., 2019; Hey, et. al., 2019;\nChin-Yee and Upshur, 2019; Green et al., 2022; Plutynski, 2018;\nPlutynski, 2022). Skepticism comes from several sources. First, some\nraise methodological concerns about representativeness of samples,\nsample quality and purity, batch effects, and the fact that methods of\nboth sequence analysis and data labeling and curation are constantly\nbeing updated, such that data gathered even five years past may need\nrevisiting. Others warn that different ways of labeling the same\ngenetic information can lead to contradictory results in clinical\ntrials of novel cancer drugs, or mistaken inferences about likely\nprogression or treatment benefit (Hey, 2015, 2019; Hey, et. al., 2016,\n2019). Some worry that genomic data is a static representation of gene\nexpression profile at a single point in time, but cancer is a dynamic\nprocess, shaped in part by the \u201ctumor microenvironment\u201d\n(TME) \u2013 the environment surrounding a tumor. If we are\ninterested in determining how cancers progress, or are likely to\nrespond to treatment, we arguably need to take multiple samples at\nseveral points in time, and even broaden consideration of relevant\ncausal factors outside the (local) tumor environment, to the\n\u201ctumor organismal environment\u201d (TOE) (Laplane, et. al.,\n2018, 2019b). How best to integrate as wide as possible an array of\ngenomic, extra-genomic, and clinical information is not obvious, as\nwell as how best to take into consideration the dynamic features of\ncancer progression.\n\nThe larger issues raised by this case is whether there is one way to\nprivilege choice of causal basis for classifying disease. Different\nchoice of temporal or spatial scale, or more or less fine-grained\ncharacterization of causal processes, might yield multiple,\noverlapping disease classifications. While some may be willing to bite\nthis bullet, and indeed, endorse pluralism and non-hierarchical\nclassifications (see, e.g., Khalidi 1998, 2013), others might be\nconcerned that this would yield too permissive an array of disease\ntypes, or inconsistent classifications, thus complicating scientific\ncommunication. More generally, this case raises some interesting\npuzzles about the aims and methods of classification in the biomedical\nsciences more generally. Given that genomic features of cancer are\nunlikely to unproblematically yield a single natural taxonomy, we\nmight become skeptical of reductive pictures of disease classification\nand explanation. It seems that classifications of disease like cancer\nform a kind of \u2018hybrid\u2019\u2014they are intended to capture\nnatural regularities and their causes, but also to be of use for a\nwide array of agents with different purposes. It\u2019s unclear\nwhether all these purposes can be served by one method or set of\nclassificatory criteria.\n",
