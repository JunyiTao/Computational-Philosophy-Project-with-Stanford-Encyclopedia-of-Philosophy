    "main_text": "Cognitive phenomenology || Epistemic markers of consciousness\n5.4 Epistemic markers of consciousness\n\nPhenomenal consciousness has various epistemic markers: It gives rise\nto (at least the appearance of) an explanatory gap (see Levine 1983\nand the entry on\n consciousness),\n it is susceptible to zombie thought experiments (see Chalmers 1996\nand the entry on\n zombies),\n and it is susceptible to the knowledge argument (see Jackson 1982 and\nthe entry Qualia: The Knowledge Argument).\n These arguments usually focus on sensory phenomenal consciousness.\nFor example, Levine\u2019s central example is that of pain and\nJackson\u2019s is that of experiencing red. \n\nThe initial plausibility of these kinds of arguments might be taken to\nserve as an indicator of phenomenal consciousness: plausibly, if these\narguments have some traction with some mental state, then that mental\nstate is likely to have phenomenal properties. Some have used the\npresence or absence of such markers to argue for or against cognitive\nphenomenology.\n\nGoldman (1993b) argues that a version of Jackson\u2019s (1982)\nthought experiment can be run with propositional attitudes, such as\ndoubt and disappointment: \n\n\nJackson\u2019s example is intended to dramatize the claim that there\nare subjective aspects of sensations that resist capture in\nfunctionalist terms. I suggest a parallel style of argument for\nattitude types. Just as someone deprived of any experience of colors\nwould learn new things upon being exposed to them, viz., what it feels\nlike to see red, green, and so forth, so (I submit) someone who had\nnever experienced certain propositional attitudes, e.g., doubt or\ndisappointment, would learn new things on first undergoing these\nexperiences. There is \u201csomething it is like\u201d to have these\nattitudes, just as much as there is \u201csomething it is like\u201d\nto see red. (Goldman 1993b: 365) \n\n\nIn other words, Goldman argues that Jackson\u2019s thought experiment\nis compelling in the case of propositional attitudes and that this\nsupports the claim that propositional attitudes have proprietary\nphenomenal properties above and beyond functional properties.\n(Presumably, Goldman intends his argument to apply only to occurrent\npropositional attitudes, since he takes standing states to be purely\ndispositional (1993b: 366).) Goff (2012) makes similar observations.\n\n\nHorgan (2011a) also uses epistemic indicators of phenomenal\nconsciousness to argue for cognitive phenomenology. He argues that\nsince partial zombies lacking cognitive phenomenology are conceivable\nand phenomenally different from us, we have cognitive phenomenology.\n\n\nInterestingly, Carruthers and Veillet (2011) use epistemic indicators\nto argue against cognitive phenomenology. They claim that thought is\nnot susceptible to the explanatory gap, and thus that there is no\ncognitive phenomenology. \n",
