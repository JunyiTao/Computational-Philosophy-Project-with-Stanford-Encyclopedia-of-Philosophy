    "main_text": "\n\nSalomon Maimon (1753\u20131800) stands as one of the most acute,\noriginal, complicated philosophers \u2014 and certainly one of the\nmost fascinating personalities \u2014 of the eighteenth century. By\ngranting the principle of sufficient reason unlimited validity Maimon\nembraces a radical form of rationalism. His robust criteria for the\nvalidity of knowledge suggests that even Kant\u2019s attempt to limit\nepistemological claims to the realm of possible experience cannot be\nsecured without a substantial metaphysical commitment. Kant faces a\nsevere choice: either adopt elements from the dogmatic, rationalist,\nmetaphysics he set out to challenge, or accept that his system is\nundermined by skepticism about his critical idealism. In revealing\nwhat he sees as the skeptical implications of rationalism, Maimon\nraises important objections to Kant\u2019s critical idealism, as well\nas develops deep insights into the problems of experience and\ngivenness. His \u2018skeptically rationalist\u2019 claims about the\nnature and limits of human cognition present a distinctive perspective\non the Kantian project of transcendental idealism, as well as on\ncentral epistemological issues concerning the relation between thought\nand the world. The eminent German scholar, Manfred Frank recently\nsuggested that Maimon is the \u201clast great philosopher\u201d\nabout to be discovered.\n",
