    "main_text": "\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of English seventeenth-century\nthinkers associated with the University of Cambridge. The most\nimportant philosophers among them were\n Henry More\n (1614\u20131687) and\n Ralph Cudworth\n (1617\u20131688), both fellows of Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge.\nThe group also included\n Benjamin Whichcote\n (1609\u20131683),\n Peter Sterry\n (1613\u20131672),\n John Smith\n (1618\u20131652),\n Nathaniel Culverwell\n (1619\u20131651), and John Worthington (1618\u20131671). All of\nthem studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, apart from More who\nstudied at Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge, where Cudworth was later\nappointed Master. Their personal and intellectual fortunes were\nimpacted by events of the English Civil War and its aftermath. They\ndeveloped their philosophical views against a background of the\nCalvinistic scholasticism which prevailed at Cambridge in their\nformative years. They did not self-identify as a group or as\nPlatonists. They only came to be referred to as Platonists in the\neighteenth century. But in so far as they all held the philosophy of\nPlato and Plotinus in high regard, and adopted principles of Platonist\nepistemology and metaphysics, the designation \u2018Platonist\u2019 is apt.\nThey drew on a wide range of philosophical sources besides Platonism.\nFor example, among ancient philosophers, they were well acquainted\nwith Aristotle and with Stoicism. They shared the Renaissance\nHumanists\u2019 regard for the achievements of ancient philosophy, as\nwell as their interpretation of ancient philosophy, which was informed\nby a strong sense of its relevance of to contemporary life. At the\nsame time, they were also very much abreast of new developments in\nphilosophy and science \u2013 with Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza as\nwell as Bacon, Boyle and the Royal Society. Smith, Culverwell,\nCudworth and More were among the first Englishmen to read Descartes.\nBoth More and Cudworth were fellows of the Royal Society. The\nframework within which they read and understood ancient and modern\nphilosophy was that of the \u2018perennial philosophy\u2019\n(philosophia perennis) adopted by Italian Renaissance\nphilosophers such as Marsilio Ficino, and Agostino Steucho, but also\nemployed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. They also emphatically\nrepudiated the scholasticism that prevailed in academic philosophy and\ntook a lively interest in the developments that brought about the\nscientific revolution. They therefore form part of the philosophical\nrevolution of the seventeenth century, especially since they sought an\nalternative philosophical foundation to Aristotelianism which was\nwaning fast in the face of challenges from scepticism and competing\nalternative philosophies, notably those of Hobbes and Descartes. \n\nAt a time when philosophy in the universities was considered the\nhandmaid of theology, they devoted their considerable philosophical\nlearning to religious and moral issues, to defending the existence of\nGod and the immortality of the soul, and to formulating a practical\nethics for Christian conduct. Convinced of the compatibility of reason\nand faith, they held the eternal existence of moral principles and of\ntruth, and that the human mind is equipped with the principles of\nreason and morality. Their optimistic view of human capacities is\nunderscored by their emphasis on the freedom of the will. Their\nanti-determinism led them to propose arguments for human autonomy.\nThey were all dualists for whom mind is ontologically prior to matter,\nand for whom the truths of the mind are superior to sense-knowledge.\nThey accepted post-Galilean science, and propounded an atomistic\ntheory of matter. But they repudiated the new mechanistic natural\nphilosophy in favour of the view the fundamental causal principle in\nthe operations of nature is some form of immaterial agent or\nspirit.\n",
