    "main_text": "\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine (1908\u20132000) worked in theoretical\nphilosophy and in logic. (In practical philosophy\u2014ethics and\npolitical philosophy\u2014his contributions are negligible.) He is\nperhaps best known for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in\nparticular, against its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction).\nThis argument, however, should be seen as part of a comprehensive\nworld-view which makes no sharp distinction between philosophy and\nempirical science, and thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the\nsubject.\n\nIn what follows, a very brief section on Quine\u2019s life and\nphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve\nto orient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on\nQuine\u2019s work in pure logic or set theory (for Quine\u2019s work\non set theory, see the entry on\n Quine\u2019s New Foundations),\n and also Morris 2018. The third section is devoted to Quine\u2019s\narguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to\ntake its place. The subsequent three sections go systematically\nthrough Quine\u2019s own views; the final section is on Quine\u2019s\nplace in the history of philosophy.\n",
