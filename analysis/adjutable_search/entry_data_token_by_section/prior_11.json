    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Politics\n3.4 Politics\n\n\nAt first, the Priors lived in a handsome Georgian hotel close to the\nfamous libraries of the British Museum and University College, but they\nquickly moved into cheaper accommodation in Lambeth. They were a short\nstroll from the bustling working-class street market of Lambeth Walk,\nand not far from overcrowded and insanitary slums. No doubt Lambeth\nreinforced the views Arthur had expressed the year before in the\nOtago Daily Times, under the pseudonym \u2018Independent\nLabour\u2019: \u2018We must all fight either with the wage-earners\nfor a society of wage-earners or with the profit-seekers for a society\nof profit-seekers\u2019. For Arthur the \u2018fundamental\nquestion\u2019 was: \u2018Are the workers going to group together to\norganise and undertake their own enterprise, or are they going to be at\nthe beck and call of a privileged class\u2019 (Prior 1937a).\n\n\nHe saw London through socialist eyes. The streets \u2018are full of\nbeggars\u2019, he wrote to his cousin Hugh Teague: \u2018blind men,\nparalytics, pavement artists, organ grinders, Welsh miners\u2019. He\ngave the Red salute to the miners (who were fleeing in their thousands\nfrom devastating unemployment in Wales) and found they returned it\n\u2018with great gusto\u2019. The previous year he described his\n\u2018thinking on social questions\u2019 as owing \u2018a great\ndeal\u2019 to the Trotskyist writings of Auckland philosopher William\nAnderson and also to the writings of the Marxist-Leninist thinker\nSorel, whose essays he translated at Roquebrune. He said he learned\nmore from Sorel \u2018than from any other Marxist\ntheoreticians\u2019. Like Sorel, he saw the importance of \u2018the\nsubstitution of a \u201cproducer-mentality\u201d for an\n\u201cemployee-mentality\u201d among the workers\u2019:\nEngland\u2019s problems, Prior said, included the \u2018servility of\nthe English masses\u2019 and \u2018their almost unbounded willingness\nto \u201ckeep their place\u201d\u2019.\n\n\nHe told Hugh: \u2018I personally get much the same kind of\n\u201ckick\u201d out of reading Lenin at his best, as I do out of\nreading some of the tough & argumentative old Scottish\nCalvinists\u2014John Knox and the rest\u2019. Prior remained strongly\nleft-wing for the rest of his life, but his flirtation with communism\nwas over by 1946. In that year he wrote to his friend Lex Miller,\nsaying he had been \u2018released\u2019 from \u2018a sort of complex\nthat I have had about Marxism right up till now, a kind of inward\nbondage to it despite all my points of difference from it, based on the\nfeeling that though its philosophy might be abominable its economics\nwere unanswerable.\u2019\n\n\nAs Prior explained to Miller, he now saw that \u2018the Marxists\nwere guilty of an economic fallacy\u2019:\n\n\n\nall this business about capitalism involving a\n\u2018contradiction\u2019 seems to be just hooey \u2026 I write, of\ncourse, with the zeal of a convert; or more accurately with the\nindignation of a man who has just discovered that he has been\nhoodwinked for years.\n\n\n\nIn February 1939, Arthur summed up his and Clare\u2019s situation\nin London: \u2018I\u2019m afraid we haven\u2019t acclimatised\nourselves to the ways of England\u2019, he wrote: \u2018We\u2019ve\nno desire to be back in N.Z., but there\u2019s a lot over here that\nit\u2019s hard to stomach\u2019. Worse, war was approaching. During\nthe Munich crisis, in the autumn of the previous year, Clare had\nwatched sandbag air-raid shelters being constructed across London, and\nshe saw long queues everywhere as people waited to get gas masks\nfitted. She was (she wrote) \u2018half-expecting to hear any moment\nthe noise of thunder as planes filled the air\u2019 (Everdean\n1938a).\n\n\nHitler invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, and in July Arthur\nwrote about the plight of Czech refugees in the weekly newspaper\nThe Christian World (Prior 1939). The Priors had been involved\nfor some time in aiding refugees, and they applied for a job that\nArthur called \u2018tutor-&-mother-superior\u2019 at a small\nhostel in the East End, caring for Jewish children fleeing Austria. It\nwas, he said, \u2018a very bitter disappointment\u2019 when they did\nnot get the job.\n\n\nAs Europe sank into war, the Priors were ardent pacifists. Not long\nafter their visits to Germany and Austria, and as the Spanish Civil War\nraged, they joined the pacifist organisation Pax. New Zealand writer\nDan Davin\u2014who described the prewar Prior as resembling Welsh poet\nDylan Thomas\u2014spent some time with him in Oxford during the weeks\nbefore Britain\u2019s declaration of war on Germany, saying that Prior\nwould argue for long hours about pacifism in Oxford\u2019s \u2018Lamb\n& Flag\u2019 pub (Kenny 1971).\n\n\nWhen Britain finally lurched onto a war footing in September 1939,\nPrior found doubts about his pacifism creeping in: \u2018I must\nconfess my pacifism was a little shaky round about that time\u2019, he\nwrote in December. \u2018I was sure enough of my own duty not to join\nup, but was hesitant to condemn the whole business\u2019.\n",
