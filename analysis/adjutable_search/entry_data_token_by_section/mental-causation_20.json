    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || Identity Solutions\n6.5 Identity Solutions\n\nAutonomy and inheritance solutions grant at least this much to the\nExclusion Problem: mental and physical properties are numerically\ndistinct, however intimately they are otherwise related. But a third\nsort of strategy tries to undermine the argument at exactly this\npoint: any mental property just is its physical realizer. If\nM=P, there\u2019s no question of one\u2019s\nexcluding the other, nor is there any mystery of how M can\nwork through P, for M and P are one and the\nsame.\n\nThis sort of psychophysical property identity would seem to be blocked\nby the multiple realizability argument sketched earlier. But that\nargument, in spite of its wide appeal, has come under attack from\nseveral directions (see\n multiple realizability,\n \u00a72). For example, some (Kim 1992; Lewis 1994; Jackson 1995; Heil\n2003) take the argument to show, not that mental properties are\ndistinct from their physical realizers, but that what we thought was\none kind of mental property is actually many. Pains realized by\ndifferent physical properties, in spite of having the same\nname (\u201cpain\u201d), are different, though similar,\nmental properties. There is no such property as pain\nsimpliciter, only pain-for-this-physical-structure and\npain-for-that-physical structure. Once such\n\u201cstructure-specific\u201d identities are allowed, we can say\nthat M (now just, say, pain-for-human beings) is identical\nwith P, M\u2019s \u201crealizer\u201d in human\nbeings (replies include Fodor 1997; Block 1997; Marras 2003; Moore and\nCampbell 2010).\n\nThis solution comes at a price: it forces us to abandon the belief\nthat pain is a single, natural kind. There is, however, a way to\npreserve this doctrine while pursuing a strategy that\u2019s\notherwise similar to the one just sketched. The essential idea is that\n\u201cproperty\u201d as we\u2019ve used the term so far is\nambiguous. A property could be what characterizes an object (event),\nor what unifies several objects as a \u201cone across many\u201d.\nNow suppose the characterizing properties are\n tropes:\n particularized properties, unique to each object. And suppose the\nunifying properties are something else\u2014call these\n\u201ctypes\u201d. If the mental \u201cproperties\u201d that are\ncausally relevant to behavior are tropes, and the mental\n\u201cproperties\u201d mentioned in the multiple realizability\nargument are types, there\u2019s no reason to think that this\nargument rules out psychophysical property-identities in any way that\nleads to exclusion worries. The M-trope and the\nP-trope are one and the same trope falling under two types,\nmental and physical. This proposal allows for a single type\npain shared by diverse creatures; it\u2019s just that this\ntype is not the same sort of entity (a trope) that\u2019s efficacious\nin the production of behavior (Heil 1992; Robb 1997; Heil and Robb\n2003; what appears to be a similar view is defended by Macdonald and\nMacdonald 1986, 1995a; see also Whittle 2007.)\n\nOne worry about this proposal is that it appears to raise the\nExclusion Problem all over again, this time at the level of properties\n(tropes). If a single property is both mental and physical,\nCompleteness and No Overdetermination force us to\nsay that it\u2019s efficacious only qua physical, not\nqua mental. (For this and other criticisms, see Noordhof\n1998; Raymont 2001; Gibb 2004; Macdonald and Macdonald 2006; Alward\n2008; Maurin 2008; see Robb 2013 for some replies.)\n",
