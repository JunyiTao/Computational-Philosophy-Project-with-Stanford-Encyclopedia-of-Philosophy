    "main_text": "Paradoxes Resolved || Counterfactual paradoxes\n10.4 Counterfactual paradoxes\nIn the histories approach the rule governing counterfactual\nreasoning, as indicated in subsection 5.2, is\nthat a single framework must be used for comparing the actual and\ncounterfactual world. Counterfactual paradoxes are constructed by\nignoring this rule. One of the best known is\nWheeler\u2019s (1978) delayed choice paradox\nin which in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer the second beam splitter is\nor is not removed at a time when the quantum particle (or wave) has\nalready passed the first beam splitter, so the particle is already\nphysically present inside the interferometer. With the second beam\nsplitter absent one can determine the arm through which the particle\npassed, whereas the interference exhibited when the beam splitter is\npresent shows that the particle cannot have been in a particular\narm. \n\nThere are several other paradoxes which hinge upon the\n(incorrect) use of counterfactuals, or at least include a\ncounterfactual element in the way they are stated. Among these\nare Hardy (1992)\u2019s paradox\n\nand the somewhat similar Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nparadox (Greenberger, Horne, Shimony, &\nZeilinger 1990; Greenberger, Horne, & Zeilinger 1989). \nFor comments on how the histories approach deals with these and \nsimilar paradoxes, see the \n Further Reading supplement.\n\n\n",
