    "main_text": "The Enthymeme || Enthymemes as Dialectical Arguments\n6.3 Enthymemes as Dialectical Arguments\n\nAristotle calls the enthymeme the \u201cbody of persuasion\u201d,\nimplying that everything else is only an addition or accident to the\ncore of the persuasive process. The reason why the enthymeme, as the\nrhetorical kind of proof or demonstration, should be regarded as\ncentral to the rhetorical process of persuasion is that we are most\neasily persuaded when we think that something has been demonstrated.\nHence, the basic idea of a rhetorical demonstration seems to be this:\nIn order to make a target group believe that q, the orator\nmust first select a proposition p or some propositions\np1 \u2026 pn that are\nalready accepted by the target group; secondly he has to show that\nq can be derived from p or p1\n\u2026 pn, using p or\np1 \u2026 pn as\npremises.  Given that the target persons form their beliefs in\naccordance with rational standards, they will accept q as\nsoon as they understand that q can be demonstrated on the\nbasis of their own opinions.\n\nConsequently, the construction of enthymemes is primarily a matter of\ndeducing from accepted opinions (endoxa). Of course, it is\nalso possible to use premises that are not commonly accepted by\nthemselves, but can be derived from commonly accepted opinions; other\npremises are only accepted since the speaker is held to be credible;\nstill other enthymemes are built from signs: see\n \u00a76.5.\n That a deduction is made from accepted opinions\u2014as opposed to\ndeductions from first and true sentences or principles\u2014is the\ndefining feature of dialectical argumentation in the Aristotelian\nsense. Thus, the formulation of enthymemes is a matter of dialectic,\nand the dialectician has the competence that is needed for the\nconstruction of enthymemes. If enthymemes are a subclass of\ndialectical arguments, then it is natural to expect a specific\ndifference by which one can tell enthymemes apart from all other kinds\nof dialectical arguments (traditionally, commentators regarded logical\nincompleteness as such a difference; for some objections against the\ntraditional view, see\n \u00a76.4).\n Nevertheless, this expectation is somehow misguided: The enthymeme is\ndifferent from other kinds of dialectical arguments insofar as it is\nused in the rhetorical context of public speech (and rhetorical\narguments are called \u2018enthymemes\u2019); thus, no further\nformal or qualitative differences are needed.\n\nHowever, in the rhetorical context there are two factors that the\ndialectician has to keep in mind if she wants to become a rhetorician\ntoo, and if the dialectical argument is to become a successful\nenthymeme. First, the typical subjects of public speech do\nnot\u2014like the subjects of dialectic and theoretical\nphilosophy\u2014belong to the things that are necessarily the case,\nbut are among those things that are the goal of practical deliberation\nand can also be otherwise. Second, as opposed to well-trained\ndialecticians, the audience of a public speech is characterized by an\nintellectual insufficiency; above all, the members of a jury or\nassembly are not accustomed to following a longer chain of inferences.\nTherefore, enthymemes must not be as precise as a scientific\ndemonstration and should be shorter than ordinary dialectical\narguments. This, however, is not to say that the enthymeme is defined\nby incompleteness and brevity. Rather, it is a sign of a well-executed\nenthymeme that the content and the number of its premises are adjusted\nto the intellectual capacities of the public audience; but even an\nenthymeme that failed to incorporate these qualities would still be an\nenthymeme.\n",
