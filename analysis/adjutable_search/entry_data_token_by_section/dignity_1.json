    "main_text": "A Historical Primer || The legal history of dignity\n1.1 The legal history of dignity\n\nThe connection between law and dignity strikes many as socially and\nmorally urgent. It is thus unsurprising that some serious history of\nthis connection already exists, especially in relation to rights\ntheory (see, e.g., Eberle 2002 or Barak 2015). Nevertheless, the bulk\nof this history does not look back very far.\n\nFor example, Lewis (2007) gives a wonderful overview of the idea of\ndignity in international law, but his focus is on the writing of, and\nreaction to, the 1945 UN Charter and 1948 Declaration of Human Rights.\nOr consider McCrudden\u2019s impressive 2013 edited volume,\nUnderstanding Human Dignity. The historical chapters of this\nvolume make important contributions, but again the focus is largely\nthe twentieth century. Scott\u2019s chapter (2013), for example,\nbegins by observing that the 1848 French decree to abolish slavery\nmotivates itself from the consideration \u201cthat slavery is an\nassault upon human dignity (la dignit\u00e9 humaine)\u201d\n(2013: 61). She then nicely explores the idea of dignity in the\ncontext of post-slavery Louisiana c.1862\u201396. However, the\nchapter then jumps forward to a comparison with Brazilian society\nc.1970\u20132012. Moyn\u2019s chapter (2013) examines early and\nmiddle twentieth century constitutional debates to show that the\nconcept of dignity labors under poorly appreciated debts to a\nspecifically Christian conception of democracy, and for this reason,\nMoyn argues, we should be skeptical about the long-term utility of\ndignity for secular rights theory. And Goos\u2019s chapter (2013)\noffers a close examination of the role of dignity in German thought,\nbut the focus is on post-World War II interpretation of the German\nGrundgesetz (Basic\n Law).[1]\n\nA longer legal history can be found in McCrudden (2008), whose concise\nreview of dignity reaches back to classical Roman thought. McCrudden\nargues that we can trace the merit connotation of dignity as\n\u201celevated social rank\u201d to the Roman idea of\n\u201cdignitas homini\u201d (2008: 656); but also, and\ncrucially, he argues that we can trace our contemporary\nmoral-political notion of the \u201cbasic worth or status of human\npersons\u201d to this same period, when Cicero introduced the idea of\n\u201cthe dignity of the human race\u201d (see also, Cancik 2002).\nThis claim about Cicero is echoed in Michael Rosen\u2019s 2012,\nDignity: Its History and Meaning, which is another important\nentry into dedicated history that focuses on legal connections.\nRosen\u2019s history is mostly from a bird\u2019s eye view, but,\nlike McCrudden\u2019s, Rosen\u2019s history has the virtue of taking\na long view that stretches back to antiquity. Moreover, Rosen offers\nsome nuanced reflections on eighteenth and nineteenth century\nconnections, including Kant\u2019s influence on the writing of the\nGerman Grundgesetz.\n\nFinally, when it comes to legal history, Darwall (2017) offers a\nsophisticated analysis of dignity\u2019s connections to western\nEnlightenment conceptions of jurisprudence stretching back to the\nsixteenth century. Importantly, however, Darwall\u2019s history\nchallenges McCrudden\u2019s and Rosen\u2019s appeal to Cicero as a\nkey source. We will return to this scholarly disagreement and\nDarwall\u2019s competing proposal below\n (\u00a71.2.2\n and\n \u00a71.2.4).\n",
