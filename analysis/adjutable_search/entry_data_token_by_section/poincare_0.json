    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nJules Henri Poincar\u00e9 was born on April 29, 1854 in Nancy in the\nLorraine region of France. His father was professor of Hygiene in the\nSchool of Medicine at the University of Nancy. His cousin Raymond was\nto become the President of the Republic of France during the period\n1913\u20131920 and his younger sister Aline married the philosopher\nEmile Boutroux. Henri was a precocious student who rose immediately to\nthe top of his class, excelling in both science and letters. At age\n13, his teacher told his mother that \u201cHenri will become a\nmathematician \u2026 I would say a great mathematician\u201d\n(Bellivier 1956: 78). During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the\nGermans occupied Nancy and the Poincar\u00e9 family was obliged to\nbillet the secretary of the civil commissar of Nancy, with whom Henri\nwould have a round of conversation each night after dinner in order to\nimprove his German (see Rollet 2012).\n\nIn 1871 Poincar\u00e9 passed the exams in letters with the grade\n\u201cgood\u201d and that in science with the grade\n\u201cfair.\u201d He received a zero in mathematics for answering a\ndifferent question from the one that was asked, apparently having\nmisunderstood the question. He then took the preparatory classes in\nmathematics and was first in his class, also first in the academic\ncompetition and first in the national competition (concours\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral) in elementary mathematics. In Paris, he entered\nthe \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1873 and after graduating in 1875\n(second in his class having apparently lost points for his inability\nto draw), entered the \u00c9cole des Mines. An extensive\ncorrespondence with his mother has been preserved from this period of\nstudy in Paris (Rollet 2017). After brief service as a mine inspector,\nhe submitted a dissertation on partial differential equations and was\nthen hired to teach the course on differential and integral calculus\nat the University of Caen. In 1880 he submitted a paper solving a\nproblem in the theory of differential equations to the competition for\nthe grand prize in mathematics of the Academy of Sciences in Paris.\nFor the first time he made use of non-Euclidean geometry, which was\nseen by most of his contemporaries as purely speculative.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 married Louise Poulain d\u2019Andecy on April 20,\n1881 and soon thereafter joined the faculty of sciences at the\nUniversity of Paris. In 1886 he succeeded G. Lippmann in the chair of\nmathematical physics and probability. In 1896 he was given the chair\nof mathematical astronomy and celestial mechanics, in 1902 he was\nnamed professor of theoretical electricity at the Bureau de Poste et\nT\u00e9l\u00e9graph and in 1904 professor of general astronomy at\nthe \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Poincar\u00e9 also worked at the\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes from 1893 (Galison 2003).\n\nIn 1889 Poincar\u00e9 won a prize from the King of Sweden for a\nquestion posed by Weierstrass on the stability of the solar system,\nthat is, the three-body (or \\(n\\)-body) problem in\nclassical mechanics. Despite a mathematical error that he discovered\nat the last moment (after questions raised by the Swedish\nmathematician Lars Edvard Phragm\u00e9n) and frantically corrected,\nthe work was important for its use of topology and as a founding\ndocument in chaos theory, for Poincar\u00e9 showed that in general,\nthe stability of such systems cannot be demonstrated. It is also in\nthis context that he proved his famous recurrence theorem.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 joined the French Academy of Sciences in 1887 and\nbecame its president in 1906. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie\nFran\u00e7aise in 1908 on the basis of his three books on\nphilosophical and general problems in science. He also became a\ncorresponding member of many international scientific organizations.\nHis travel included a trip to America to give a lecture at the St.\nLouis World\u2019s Fair in 1904. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s extensive\ncorrespondence demonstrates the extent of his connection to the\nscientific community of his time (Nabonnand 1999; Walter 2007, 2016).\nHe also co-signed a report that played an important role in the\nrehabilitation of Dreyfus (Rollet 1999).\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is also famous for his 1904 conjecture concerning the\ntopology of three-dimensional spheres which remained one of the major\nunsolved problems in mathematics until the Russian mathematician\nGrigori Perelman succeeded in demonstrating it nearly one hundred\nyears later. Poincar\u00e9 lectured on contemporary mathematical\nphysics for years and was very much abreast of current developments.\nPopularizer of science, pedagogue, man of letters, he became an icon\nof the popular press (see Rollet 2017, XLVI). In all he published over\nfive hundred scientific papers and over thirty books. He died July 17,\n1912 in Paris from a blood clot to the brain which was a complication\nof surgery, survived by his wife and their four children (see Rollet\n2000, Boutroux 2012, Ginoux and Gerini 2012).\n",
