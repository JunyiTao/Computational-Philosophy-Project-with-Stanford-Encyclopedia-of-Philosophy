    "main_text": "Historical Highlights of the Relation\n1. Historical Highlights of the Relation\n\n\nFor the most part, the philosophical history of the relation between \nidentity and ethics up until the 17th Century is about the\nrelation between identity and self-regarding practical concerns. \nPlato is a prime example. He held in the Phaedo that I (and \nall persons) will survive the death and destruction of my body \ninsofar as what I essentially am is a simple, immaterial soul, \nsomething whose own essence is being alive. This yields the direct \nimplication that, insofar as I will survive the death of my body, I \nam justified in anticipating post-mortem experiences. Lucretius, on \nthe other hand, while also focused solely on the relation between \nidentity and prudential concerns, denied the Platonic view that I \nwould be justified in post-mortem anticipation, simply because \n\u201cif any feeling remains in mind or spirit after it has been torn\nfrom body, that is nothing to us, who are brought into being by the \nwedlock of body and spirit, conjoined and coalesced\u201d (Lucretius \n1951, 121). In other words, I am essentially a union of body and \nsoul, and so even if my soul lives on, and even if it is capable of \nhaving experiences, I am not justified in anticipating them given \nthat my body \u2013 an essential component of me \u2013 \nwill have disintegrated. For both, however, identity is thought to \nbe what grounds prudential concern: the difference between Lucretius \nand Plato is only over what identity consists in (although for a \ncontrasting interpretation of Lucretius, see Martin and Barresi 2003,\n10).\n\n\nIt was not until John Locke that there was an explicit attempt to \nconnect personal identity with broader ethical concerns. Locke \nfamously called \u201cperson\u201d a forensic term, \n\u201cappropriating actions and their merit; and so belongs only to \nintelligent agents capable of a law, and happiness, and misery\u201d\n(Locke 1694, 50\u201351). This means that an account of the \nidentity of persons across time will have forensic \u2013 \nnormative \u2013 implications. And so it does.\n\n\nLocke's account of personal identity appealed to what seems a crucial\ncondition of moral agency, namely, self-reflective consciousness. On \nhis view, a person \u2013 a moral agent \u2013 Y at \nt2 is identical to a person X at \nt1 just in case Y's consciousness \n\u201ccan be extended backwards\u201d to X \n(Ibid., 39), and this is typically taken to mean that \nY remembers X's thoughts and experiences. \nThis is what we might call a relational account of identity,\nfor it maintains that persons at different times are identical to one another\nin virtue of some relation(s) between them, where such relations \nmight be psychological or physical. Locke thus rejected what we might\ncall a substance-based view of identity, which maintains \nthat persons at different times are identical to one another in virtue of \ntheir consisting in one and the same substance.\n\n\nNow once we have Locke's relational account of identity in hand, we \ncan see what implications it will have for various normative issues. \nStart with prudential rationality. On Locke's view, I am \nappropriately concerned, both for the past stage of myself to whom my\nconsciousness extends, but also to some future person \u2013 me \n\u2013 to whom my consciousness will extend. This is the mechanism \nby which I would be justified, for example, in anticipating the \nafterlife, just in case at the resurrection there will be \nsomeone to whom my present consciousness extends.  This person \nwould be me even though he might have a very different body than I \nhave now (Ibid., 44). It should be unimportant to me, on this view,\nwhat substance (body or soul) I find my consciousness \n\u2013 myself \u2013 attached to. If, for example, my little finger\nwere cut off and my consciousness adhered to it, \u201cthat would\nbe the same self which was concerned for the whole body yesterday, as\nmaking part of itself, whose actions then it cannot but admit as its \nown now\u201d (Ibid., 46).\n\n\nIt is this sort of remark \u2013 about my ownership of certain\nactions \u2013 that yields a connection between identity and moral\nresponsibility (\u201caccountability,\u201d for Locke), for one is\njustifiably held accountable only for those actions performed by a\nself to whom one's present consciousness extends, that is, it is only\nfor those actions I  remember performing that I can\njustifiably be held accountable. As Locke puts it, if I am punished\nfor the actions of a self whose thoughts and experiences I do not\nremember, \u201cwhat difference is there between that punishment, and\nbeing created miserable?\u201d (Ibid., 51) Thus, on the Day\nof Judgment, \u201cThe sentence shall be justified by the\nconsciousness all persons shall have, that they themselves, in what\nbodies soever they appear, or what substances soever that\nconsciousness adheres to, are the same that committed those actions,\nand deserve that punishment for them\u201d (Ibid.).\n\n\nThe key for Locke is that what grounds both prudential concern and\nmoral responsibility is the personal identity relation, a relation\nuniquely unifying temporally distinct person-stages via\nconsciousness. And it was because Locke prized apart personal identity\nfrom biological identity, and any other sort of substance-based\nidentity, that later philosophers like Joseph Butler and Thomas Reid\nobjected to it. So, for example, Butler accuses Locke of a\n\u201cwonderful mistake,\u201d which is that he failed to recognize\nthat the relation of consciousness\npresupposes identity, and thus cannot constitute it (Butler\n1736, 100). In other words, I can remember only my own experiences,\nbut it is not my memory of an experience that makes it mine;\nrather, I remember it only because it's already mine. So\nwhile memory can reveal my identity with some past experiencer, it\ndoes not make that experiencer me. What I am remembering, insists\nButler, are the experiences of a substance, namely, the same substance\nthat constitutes me now.\n\n\nSimilarly, Reid affirms Butler's objection and then adds a few of his\nown. One is that Locke's criterion implies the contradictory position\nthat someone could both be and not be identical to some past stage, \nan objection illustrated by the Brave Officer Case. Suppose that as \nhe is stealing the enemy's standard, a forty-year-old brave officer \nremembers stealing apples from a neighbor's orchard when he was ten, \nand then suppose further that when he is eighty years old, a retired \ngeneral, he remembers stealing the enemy's standard as a brave \nofficer but no longer remembers stealing the neighbor's apples. On \nLocke's account the general would have to be both identical to the \napple-stealer (because of the transitivity of the identity relation: \nhe's identical to the brave officer, who himself is identical to the \napple-stealer) and not identical to the apple-stealer (given\nthat he has no direct memory of the boy's experiences) (Reid 1785, \n114\u2013115).\n\n\nAnother objection is based precisely on the link between identity and\nethics: how can identity \u2013 sameness \u2013 be based \non a relation (consciousness) that changes from moment to moment? A \nperson would never remain the same from one moment to the next, \n\u201cand as the right and justice of reward and punishment are \nfounded on personal identity, no man could be responsible for his \nactions\u201d (Ibid., 117). But such an implication must be\nabsurd. And Butler concurs, expanding the point to include \nconsiderations of prudential concern:\n\n[If Locke's view is correct,] it must follow, that it is a fallacy\nupon ourselves, to charge our present selves with any thing we did, or\nto imagine our present selves interested in any thing which befell us\nyesterday, or that our present self will be interested in what will\nbefall us to-morrow; since our present self is not, in reality, the\nsame with the self of yesterday, but another like self or person coming\nin its room, and mistaken for it; to which another self will succeed\ntomorrow (Butler 1736, 102).\n\n\n\nBoth Reid and Butler, then, wind up rejecting Locke's relational view\nin favor of a substance-based view of identity. (And Reid's objection\nin particular anticipates Derek Parfit's \u201cExtreme Claim,\u201d\nto be discussed later.)\n\n\nWhat Butler and Reid retain in common with Locke, though, is the \nbelief that identity grounds certain of our patterns of concern, both\nprudential and moral. As Reid puts it, \u201cIdentity . . . is the \nfoundation of all rights and obligations, and of accountableness, and\nthe notion of it is fixed and precise\u201d (Reid 1785, 112). What \nthey disagree over is just what identity consists in. Notice, though,\nthe methodological assumption here: a theory of identity's \nplausibility depends significantly on how well it accounts for our \npractical concerns. So if Locke's view were right, say Reid and \nButler, it would require a host of radical changes to our practices \nof responsibility attribution and prudential deliberation. But, \ncontinues the argument, because making such changes would be crazy \n\u2013 we are strongly committed to the correctness of our current \nways of doing things \u2013 Locke's view cannot be right. And \nalthough Locke disagrees that the implications of his view are crazy,\nhe does agree to the basic methodology. So while he admits that he \nhas made some suppositions \u201cthat will look strange to some \nreaders\u201d (Locke 1694, 51), he is also at pains to show that our\npractices are actually already in conformity with the implications of\nhis view, e.g., human law emphasizes the necessity of continuous \nconsciousness, \u201cnot punishing the mad man for the sober man's \nactions, nor the sober man for what the mad man did\u201d \n(Ibid., 47). And this is a methodological assumption that \nhas been retained by most theorists on identity and ethics since.\n\n\nBoth Butler and Reid believe Locke's view implies that no one exists\nbeyond the present moment, i.e., that Locke's view is just the\nfollowing: X at t1 is identical to\nY at t2 just in case Y's\nconsciousness is one and the same as X's\nconsciousness. But because consciousness changes from moment to\nmoment, X's consciousness could never be identical to\nY's. Unfortunately, this seems a misunderstanding of the\ntheory (even though Locke does sometimes use the phrase \u201csame\nconsciousness,\u201d which doesn't foster clear\nunderstanding). Instead, X and Y are, on Locke's\nactual view, identical just in case\nX and Y are related via consciousness,\ni.e., just in case Y remembers the thoughts and experiences\nof X. But if that is the view, then identity could be just as\nstrict, fixed, and precise as both Butler and Reid seem to want, for\nY could be identical to X only in case that relation\nobtains, no matter how strongly or weakly.\n\n\nNevertheless, even if this objection to Locke is thwarted, the others\nremain in force. For one thing, memory does seem to presuppose \npersonal identity, and so cannot constitute a criterion of it. For \nanother, identity is a transitive relation, while memory isn't, so \nthe latter can't be a criterion of the former. Finally, there is the \nobvious worry that identity seems to persist through the loss of \nmemory: it's hard to believe that I would cease to exist were I to \nundergo amnesia. It's for all these reasons that contemporary \ntheorists working in the Lockean tradition have had to make \nsignificant changes to the theory to make it viable.\n",
