    "main_text": "Metaethical theological voluntarism || What sort of dependence?\n2.4 What sort of dependence?\n\nThe third issue that must be dealt with in providing a formulation of\ntheological voluntarism is that of the specification of the dependence\nrelationship that holds between divine commands/intentions that A\n\u03c6 and the moral obligation of A to \u03c6. There have been\nseveral options considered whose nature and merits are worth\ndiscussing here. On an analysis view, it is part of the\nmeaning of \u2018it is morally obligatory for A to\n\u03c6\u2019 that God commands/intends that A \u03c6. On a\nreduction view, the state of affairs its being obligatory\nfor A to \u03c6 is the state of affairs God\u2019s\ncommanding/intending that A \u03c6. On a supervenience\nview, its being obligatory for A to \u03c6 supervenes on\nGod\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6. On a causal\nview, necessarily, its being obligatory for A to \u03c6 is\ncaused by God\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6, and\nnecessarily, God\u2019s commanding/intending that A \u03c6\ncauses it to be obligatory for A to \u03c6.\nCausation\n\nThe causal view is defended by Quinn (1979, 1990, 1999), and in a\nparticularly strong form: on Quinn\u2019s view, the causal connection\nbetween God\u2019s antecedently intending that A \u03c6 and\nits being obligatory for A to \u03c6 exhibits totality,\nexclusivity, activity, immediacy, and necessity.\n\nThere are at least three serious difficulties for the causation\nformulation. The first we may call the \u2018Humean worry\u2019.\nOnce we allow that its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\ndistinct from God\u2019s commanding/intending\n\u03c6-ing, there is the question of what reason we would have\nfor thinking that its being morally obligatory to \u03c6\nnecessarily obtains if God\u2019s commanding/intending\n\u03c6-ing obtains. And whatever answer the defender of this\nview offers, it must be consistent with the causation formulation of\ntheological voluntarism. But it is unclear what would do the trick.\nOne way to try to make this necessary connection is by holding that\nthere is a prior moral obligation to obey God; and so, whenever God\ngives a command/has an intention that one perform some action, it\nfollows that one is morally obligated to perform the action\ncommanded/intended. But we cannot take this route, because if the\ncausation formulation is correct, then all moral obligations\nare caused entirely by God\u2019s commanding/intending activity;\nthere cannot be, then, this prior moral obligation to obey\nGod that would serve as part of the explanans for the\nnecessary connection between divine commands/intentions and moral\nobligations.\n\nThe causal view that is a version of (2) (that is, that its being\nobligatory for A to \u03c6 depends causally on God\u2019s\nwilling that A \u03c6) should be distinguished carefully from the\ncausal view that is a version of (3) (that is, that its being\nobligatory for A to \u03c6 depends causally on\nGod\u2019s willing that it be obligatory for A to\n\u03c6). The causal formulation of (3) has at least some\nplausibility as a result of God\u2019s sovereignty and\nomnipotence\u2014though it is in the end unclear why we should move\nfrom the claim that God is the ultimate source of all being to the\nclaim that, for all deontic states of affairs, God\u2019s willing\nthat that deontic state of affairs obtain is the immediate,\ntotal, and exclusive cause of its obtaining. Most of\nus would not, after all, find intuitively compelling a move from the\nclaim that God is ultimate source of all being to the claim that, for\nall physical states of affairs, God\u2019s willing that that\nphysical state of affairs obtain is the immediate, total, and\nexclusive cause of its obtaining. (That view is\n\u2018occasionalism\u2019, and occasionalism is a distinctly\nminority view even among theists; see Murphy 2011 (pp. 140\u2013142)\nfor a comparison between theological voluntarism and occasionalism.)\nThe causal view as an instance of (2), though, seems to have even less\nin the way of argumentative support. Why would one think that\nGod\u2019s intending that A \u03c6 is an immediate, total,\nand exclusive cause of a deontic state of affairs\u2019 obtaining? In\nthe absence of some evidence for such a connection, it is hard to see\nwhy one would be attracted to this formulation of theological\nvoluntarism.\n\nThe second worry about the causal formulation I will call the\n\u2018lack of precedent worry\u2019. Moral properties and states of\naffairs supervene on nonmoral properties and states of affairs. The\nintuitive idea is that there can be no differences in moral status\nwithout some difference in nonmoral status. The causal formulation\nsatisfies the supervenience constraint\u2014the differences in\nnonmoral status concern God\u2019s commands/intentions\u2014but it\ndoes so in a way that is unprecedented and mysterious. When we look at\nthe specific ways in which changes in nonmoral facts can make a\ndifference to the moral facts that hold, there is a pretty limited\nnumber of intelligible relationships that can hold between these\nnonmoral facts and the moral facts that supervene on them. A nonmoral\nfact can be part of what constitutes a reason to perform an action.\n(That you promised to \u03c6 can be cited in explaining why you have a\nreason to \u03c6 your promising to \u03c6 constitutes, at least in part,\nthe reason that you have to \u03c6.) It can be part of an enabling\ncondition for that reason. (The existence of a social practice of\npromising can be cited in explaining why you have a reason to \u03c6;\nthe existence of that practice might explain why your promise has the\nreason-giving force that it has.) It can be cited as a\ndefeater-defeater for a reason. (While the fact the promisee told you\nthat you need not fulfill your promise to \u03c6 typically releases you\nfrom your promise to \u03c6, the fact that you threatened to beat up\nthe promisee if he or she did not tell you that you need not fulfill\nyour promise invalidates that release, and can be cited in explaining\nwhy you have a reason to \u03c6.) But while theological voluntarism\nholds that a fact\u2014the fact that God commands/intends that one\n\u03c6\u2014explains why one has a reason (in this case, an\nobligation) to \u03c6, the causal view holds that this fact falls into\nnone of the familiar explanatory categories: it is not constitutive of\nthe reason, it is not an enabling condition for the reason, it is not\na defeater-defeater for the reason. The way that the fact is supposed\nto explain the reason is merely causal: it just brings the\nreason about, exclusively, totally, immediately. This is an entirely\nunfamiliar phenomenon: nowhere else do we encounter a merely causal\nconnection between a nonmoral fact and a moral one. (The appeal to the\nvery strangeness of divine causation itself is not sufficient to\nanswer the objection. For there is an extra strangeness here: that the\nrelationship between nonmoral and moral facts is in every case with\nwhich we are familiar a rational relationship, whereas on the causal\nformulation of theological voluntarism the relationship is merely\ncausal. Creation ex nihilo does not constitute carte blanche\nto multiply strangenesses. Interestingly, though, Wielenberg 2018 (p.\n18), which rejects the project of theistic ethics, appeals to just\nthis sort of causation to explain the supervenience of the moral on\nthe non-moral.)\n\nThe third worry is the \u2018no authority worry\u2019. Theological\nvoluntarism can be defended on the basis of considerations proper to\nmetaethics\u2014that, for example, theological voluntarism provides\nthe best explanation for the impartiality of morals, or for its\noverridingness, or for its normativity, or for its content. But\ntheological voluntarists have tended to argue that theological\nvoluntarism has something specific to offer to theists. One of these\nbenefits on offer is that theological voluntarism fits well with the\ncentrality of the virtue of obedience in theistic thought and practice\n(Quinn 1992, p. 510; Adams 1973, pp. 99\u2013103). God is a being who\nis to be obeyed, is someone who is a practical\nauthority over us.\n\nFor one to be a practical authority over another is, at least, for one\nto have some sort of control over others\u2019 reasons for action.\nWhatever else practical authority is, it is the ability to make a\ndifference with respect to someone\u2019s reasons to act. The control\ninvolved in practical authority is, however, of a specific sort: it is\nconstitutive control. When a party is an authority over\nanother, his or her dictates constitute, at least in part, reasons for\naction for that other. (One piece of evidence for this is that when we\ntake A to be an authority over us, we will cite\n\u2018A told us to\u2019 as a reason for action.) But if\nGod\u2019s commands to \u03c6 have merely causal power to bring about\nobligations to \u03c6, then the resultant state of affairs that is the\nreason for action is its being obligatory to \u03c6\u2014a\nstate of affairs that need not be in any way constituted by\nGod\u2019s issuing any commands. No version of theological\nvoluntarism that is built simply around God\u2019s causal role in\nactualizing moral obligations implies that God is a practical\nauthority. (See Murphy 2002, 4.3.)\nSupervenience\n\nThe supervenience account is defended by Hare (2001). Suppose that we\ncontinue to interpret supervenience intuitively as the\nno-difference-in-moral-properties-without-some-difference-in-nonmoral-properties\nthesis. We can see very quickly that the theological voluntarist has\nto say something more about the sort of supervenience he or she has in\nmind in order to present what is genuinely a theological voluntarist\naccount of moral obligation. For suppose that one puts forward a view\non which both of the following claims are true: the moral law does not\ndepend on, nor is it identical with, God\u2019s commands; but God\nnecessarily commands us to follow the moral law. While it is obvious\nis that this not a version of theological voluntarism at\nall\u2014moral obligation in no way depends on divine\ncommand\u2014it satisfies the intuitive description of what is\ninvolved in the supervenience of the moral on the nonmoral: for there\ncould be, on this view, no differences in moral status without some\ndifference in divine commands. So if one is to put forward a\nsupervenience formulation of theological voluntarism, then one will\nhave to either be a little bit more doctrinaire about the\nsupervenience relationship, so that it will exclude the nonvoluntarist\nview just described, or one will have to say more than that moral\nobligations supervene on divine commands. For our purposes here, they\ncome to the same thing: that there is something more to the\nsupervenience formulation of theological voluntarism than the claim\nthat there are no differences in agents\u2019 moral obligations\nwithout some differences in the divine commands that have been imposed\non that agent.\n\nWhat is called for here is, pretty obviously, just some particular\nrelationship of ontological dependence. It will not be that of\ncausation, for reasons we have already examined. But neither does the\ndefender of the supervenience view want it to be the extreme\ndependence of moral obligations on divine commands affirmed by the\nreduction formulation, on which moral obligations just are\ndivine commands. To avoid collapse into the reduction formulation, it\nhas to hold that moral obligations are distinct from divine commands.\nIt can make this distinction in one of two ways. It could say that\nmoral obligation is wholly distinct from divine command\u2014that is,\nthat the state of affairs its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 is not constituted even in part by God\u2019s\ncommanding \u03c6-ing. Or it could say that moral\nobligation is only partially constituted by divine command\u2014that\nis, that the state of affairs its being obligatory to \u03c6,\nwhile not identical with God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, includes the state of affairs God\u2019s\ncommanding \u03c6-ing (and some other state of affairs\nbesides). Let us consider each of these possibilities in turn.\n\nSuppose first that the defender of the supervenience view affirms that\nmoral obligation is wholly distinct from divine command. If so, then\nall of the arguments that were raised against the causation\nformulation can be leveled against the supervenience view. The no\nauthority issue will arise. Because the states of affairs its\nbeing obligatory to \u03c6 and God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing will be distinct, the supervenience account lacks\nthe resources to underwrite divine authority. For God is authoritative\nonly if God\u2019s commands are themselves reasons for action, but if\nthe states of affairs its being obligatory to \u03c6 and\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing are distinct, then\nGod\u2019s commands will not be themselves reasons for action on the\nadequately strengthened supervenience view. And if these commands are\nnot themselves reasons for action, then God does not constitutively\nactualize reasons for action by His commands; and if God does not\nconstitutively actualize reasons for action by His commands, then God\nis not authoritative. The lack of precedent issue will arise. For the\nadequately strengthened supervenience view cannot view obligations as\nconstituted by divine commands, and no theological voluntarist worthy\nof the name will see God\u2019s commands as merely enablers or\ndefeater-defeaters for obligations; and so the relationship between\ndivine commands and moral obligations is bound to be unprecedented and\nmysterious. And the Humean issue will arise. For the causation view\nis, after all, just the adequately strengthened supervenience view\nplus the claim that the dependence relationship involved in a\nparticular sort of causal dependence. So, understood as affirming a\ndependence relationship between wholly distinct moral obligations and\ndivine commands, the supervenience view has all of the problems of the\ncausation view.\n\nSo the only hope for the supervenience formulation is to hold that\nGod\u2019s commands are proper parts of moral obligations: for if\nthose commands are identical with moral obligations, then the\nsupervenience view collapses into the reduction view, and if moral\nobligations are wholly distinct from divine commands, then the\nsupervenience view fails for the reasons that the causation view\nfails. There are, however, serious difficulties for this partial\nconstitution version: in particular, if one is committed to saying\nthat God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing partly\nconstitutes its being morally obligatory to \u03c6, it is hard\nto see what state of affairs the theological voluntarist would be\ntempted to say is also necessary for moral obligation to be fully\nconstituted. Obviously this other state of affairs cannot be one that\ninvolves moral obligation, on pain of circularity. (So, the\ntheological voluntarist cannot say that its being morally\nobligatory to \u03c6 just is the complex state of affairs\nconsisting both of God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing\nand its being morally obligatory to do what God commands.)\nFurther, in order to remain faithful to the basic idea of the\nsupervenience version, we would have to say that any state of affairs\nthat is held to constitute its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 along with God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing\nmust be a state of affairs that is certain to obtain if\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains. Otherwise,\nit might be the case that its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 does not supervene on God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, for there would be two possible worlds, in both of\nwhich God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains, but\nin only one of which does its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 obtain. This runs contrary to even the basic idea of the\nsupervenience view, on which there are no differences in moral\nobligations without a difference in divine commands. \n\nThese limitations make it hard to imagine what a motivated version of\nthis form of the supervenience view would look like. We have to\nimagine a view of the following form. It is nonnegotiable that the\nstate of affairs its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\npartially constituted by God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing. It is nonnegotiable that there is, apart from\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing, at least one state\nof affairs S that partially constituted its being morally\nobligatory to \u03c6. It is nonnegotiable that S either obtains\nnecessarily or at the very least necessarily obtains if\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains (otherwise\nmoral obligation would not supervene on divine command). And it is\nnonnegotiable that S not involve moral obligation. The only remotely\nplausible candidates for S that come to mind are normative states of\naffairs that fall short of the obligatory, for example,\n\u03c6-ing\u2019s being good (or virtuous, or\npraiseworthy). One might say, for example, that its being\nmorally obligatory to \u03c6 is constituted jointly by\nGod\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing and\n\u03c6-ing\u2019s being virtuous. But it is unclear what\nmotivation one would have for affirming such a position. It cannot be\nfor the sake of making sure that God cannot impose a moral obligation\nto do something that is not virtuous: for, ex hypothesi, we know\nalready that \u03c6-ing\u2019s being virtuous obtains\nwhenever God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing obtains,\nfor otherwise its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 would not\nsupervene on God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing.\n\nThe difficulty that faces the defender of the supervenience view can\nbe framed as a dilemma. If the defender of that view holds that the\nstate of affairs its being morally obligatory to \u03c6 is\nwholly distinct from God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, then he or she is refuted by the considerations\nthat refute the causation view. If, on the other hand, the defender of\nthe supervenience view holds that the state of affairs its being\nmorally obligatory to \u03c6 is partially but not wholly\nconstituted by God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing,\nthen there is pressure to explain why he or she does not simply affirm\nthe reduction view, on which its being morally obligatory to\n\u03c6 just is God\u2019s commanding \u03c6-ing.\nUnless the defender of the supervenience view identifies the state of\naffairs that, in addition to God\u2019s commanding\n\u03c6-ing, makes for a moral obligation to \u03c6, then his or\nher unwillingness to adopt the reduction view will look unmotivated\nand arbitrary.\nAnalysis\n\nAccording to the analysis view, defended in Adams 1973, the concept of\nthe morally obligatory is to be analyzed as that of being commanded by\na loving God. Adams did not put this view forward as an account of the\nmeaning of \u2018obligation\u2019 generally, but only of its meaning\nas employed in Judeo-Christian moral discourse. As evidence for this\nanalysis, Adams appealed to the freedom with which users of that\ndiscourse moved between claims of the form \u2018x is\nobligatory\u2019 and \u2018x is God\u2019s will\u2019 or\n\u2018x is God\u2019s command.\u2019\n\nThere are a couple of central difficulties for this position. The\nfirst is that it seems to imply that those inside and those outside\nthe Judeo-Christian practice of moral discourse have never disagreed\nwhen one has affirmed a claim of the form \u2018 \u03c6-ing is\nobligatory\u2019 and the other denied a claim of that form. For they\ndo not, on Adams\u2019 account, mean the same thing when they use\nthese terms. In atheistic moral discourse, a masterful user of the\nlanguage can say \u2018it is not true that God has commanded\n\u03c6-ing, but \u03c6-ing is nonetheless obligatory\u2019; in\nJudeo-Christian moral discourse, on Adams\u2019 view, one shows\noneself to be either unintelligible or not a masterful user of moral\nlanguage if one were to speak thus. Adams was aware of this\ndifficulty, and attempted to mitigate it: he argued that the agreement\nover which items the term \u2018obligatory\u2019 applied to, and the\nappropriate attitudinal and volitional responses to those things\ncorrectly described as \u2018obligatory,\u2019 made possible\nsubstantive moral discourse (Adams 1973, pp. 116\u2013120). But all\nthis seems to do is to explain how a simulacrum of genuine moral\ndiscourse is preserved; it does not show that what we get is the real\nthing.\n\nThe second difficulty is that of dealing with those within the\nJudeo-Christian tradition of moral discourse who employed or continue\nto employ moral language in a way that is out of step with\nAdams\u2019 analysis. Now, it is not sufficient to refute a suggested\nanalysis of some term that users of that term have questioned or even\nrejected that analysis. But if we take the task of analyzing terms to\nbe that of making explicit and systematizing the platitudes employing\nthat term affirmed by masterful users of that term (Smith 1994, pp.\n29\u201332), and we note that many thoughtful Jews and Christians who\notherwise appear to be masterful users of the language of moral\nobligation have rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, the notion\nthat an act is obligatory if and only if it has been commanded by God,\nthen we would have some reason to doubt whether the analysis\nformulation of theological voluntarism is defensible.\nReduction\n\nAdams\u2019 maneuver in the face of these difficulties was to move\nfrom the analysis to the reduction version of theological voluntarism.\nHe decided that the meaning of the term \u2018morally\nobligatory\u2019 was common to theists and nontheists. There is a\ncommon concept of the morally obligatory, a common concept that makes\npossible substantive agreement and disagreement between theists and\nnontheists. This common concept is neutral between theism and\nnontheism. But, following the now standard Kripke-Putnam line, Adams\naffirms that there are necessary a posteriori truths, among which are\nincluded property identifications. He argued that the property\nbeing wrong is identical to the property being contrary\nto the commands of (a loving) God because the property being\ncontrary to the commands of (a loving) God best fills the role\nassigned by the concept of wrongness (Adams 1979a, pp. 133\u2013142;\nsee also Adams 1999, pp. 252\u2013258). By conceptual analysis alone\nwe can know only that wrongness is a property of actions (and perhaps\nintentions and attitudes); that people are generally opposed to what\nthey regard as wrong; that wrongness is a reason, perhaps a conclusive\nreason, for opposing an act; and that there are certain acts (e.g.\ntorture for fun) that are wrong. But given traditional theistic\nbeliefs, the best candidate property to fill the role set by the\nconcept of wrongness is that of being contrary to (a loving)\nGod\u2019s commands. For that property is an objective property of\nactions. Further, given Christian views about the content of\nGod\u2019s commands, this identification fits well with widespread\npre-theoretical intuitions about wrongness; and given Christian views\nabout human receptivity to divine communication and God\u2019s\nwillingness to communicate both naturally and supernaturally,\nGod\u2019s commands have a causal role in our acquisition of moral\nknowledge (Adams 1979, p. 139; see also Adams 1999, pp. 257).\n\nThe reduction formulation avoids the most troublesome implications of\nthe analysis formulation, for it allows that there is a common concept\nof obligation, so that those within the Judeo-Christian tradition and\nthose outside it can engage in moral debate and can have substantive\nagreements and disagreements with each other, and so that those within\nthe Judeo-Christian tradition can raise substantive questions about\nthe relationship between God and obligation without ipso facto\nexcluding themselves from the class of masterful users of the moral\nconcepts of that community. The reduction formulation allows that the\nconcept of obligation may be nontheistic while the property that best\nfills the role assigned to it by that concept is a theistic one.\nAnalysis vs. reduction\n\nNevertheless, it remains an open question whether the reduction view\nis superior to the analysis view. One might argue that Adams\u2019\nanalogy to \u2018H2O is water\u2019 is inappropriate, as\nthe identification with water with H2O is clearly a\nposteriori, whereas the identification of the morally obligatory with\nthe commanded by God is a priori. For if Adams is right in his\ncharacterization of the concept of obligation, it is not as if those\nwho do not have the ability to infer from \u2018this is morally\nobligatory\u2019 to \u2018this is commanded by a loving God\u2019\n(and vice versa) are just missing out on an interesting extra fact,\nthe way that those without rudimentary chemistry are missing out on an\ninteresting extra fact if they do not know that water is\nH2O. The term \u2018water\u2019 can play its role in our\npractical lives perfectly well without our knowing that it is\nH2O. The term \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 cannot play\nits role in our practical lives without our knowing that the morally\nobligatory is the commanded by God. No unintelligibility creeps into\nthe life of agents that do not grasp that water is H2O;\nunintelligibility creeps into the life of agents that do not grasp\nthat the morally obligatory is what is commanded by God.\n\nWhy might one think that the masterful use of \u2018morally\nobligatory\u2019 requires recognition that the morally obligatory is\nwhat is commanded by God? If Adams is right, it is part of the meaning\nof obligation that obligations are social in character (Adams 1999, p.\n233) and involve actually made demands by one party in the social\nrelationship on another (Adams 1999, pp. 245\u2013246). It is the\nfact that a demand is actually made that gives sense to the notion\nthat one has to perform an action, rather than merely that it would be\ngood, even the best, to do it (Adams 1999, p. 246). But if it is part\nof the meaning of \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 that one is part of\na certain social relationship in which demands are actually made, then\nit is no longer just an interesting further fact that the property\nthat best answers to the concept \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 is\nthe property being commanded by God. Rather, one who denies\nthat there is a God or that God actually makes demands on human beings\nmust fail to use the term \u2018morally obligatory\u2019\nmasterfully. For think of the other marks of the moral, especially\nthose of impartiality and overridingness. For one to think of an act\nas obligatory is for one to think of it as being actually imposed on\none as a demand; for every obligation, on Adams\u2019 view, there is\nsomeone who imposes that obligation by commanding. It is clear a\npriori that the only being that could impose the sort of obligation\nthat could plausibly be classified as moral would be God. How, then,\ncould one be a masterful user of \u2018moral obligation\u2019\nwithout grasping that moral obligations are demands imposed by\nGod?\n\nThis analysis view would not, unlike Adams\u2019 earlier formulation,\nrequire the subdivision of linguistic communities. One could say that\nthe meaning of \u2018morally obligatory\u2019 includes \u2018being\ncommanded by God,\u2019 for both theists and nontheists.\nThose who do not grasp that it is of the essence of obligations to be\ndivinely commanded\u2014whether theists or nontheists\u2014fail to\nbe masterful users of the language of moral obligation. To embrace\nthis view is to return to the position of Anscombe 1958, according to\nwhich we should hold that the concept of obligation is inherently\ntheological. On this view, we should not allow that Judeo-Christian\nmoral practice has a different concept of obligation. Rather, the\ntheological understanding of obligation is the authentic one, and\nnontheological concepts of obligation are unintelligible truncations.\n\n",
