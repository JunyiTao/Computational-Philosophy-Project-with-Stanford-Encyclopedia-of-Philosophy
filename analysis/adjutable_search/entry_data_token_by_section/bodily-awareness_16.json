    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership || The agentive conception\n4.4 The agentive conception\n\nMany theories appeal to the notion of action in relation to the sense\nof ownership, and even more to the sense of disownership. The fact is\nthat disownership syndromes often involve some more or less extreme\nmotor impairment. Most somatoparaphrenic patients are paralyzed, and\nthose who are not suffer from the Anarchic hand sign (that is, they\ncannot control their limb, which seems to have a will of its own).\nPatients frequently complain about the uselessness of their\n\u2018alien\u2019 limb. There are then several ways the agentive\nconception has been spelled out: in terms of body schema (Vignemont\n2007), agentive feelings (B. Baier & Karnath 2008), or general\nagentive ability (Peacocke 2017). The challenge that the various\nversions face is that the sense of bodily ownership can be preserved\nin patients who are paralyzed or who have lost the awareness of their\nactions as their own. For example, anarchic patients report that they\nhave no control over their limbs but they still claim that their limbs\nbelong to them (Marchetti & Della Salla 1998). The rubber hand\nillusion is also difficult to account for agentive conceptions. It has\nbeen shown that there is no agentive contrast between synchronous and\nasynchronous conditions, not only at the phenomenological level\n(subjects report no agentive feelings toward the rubber hand, Longo et\nal. 2008), but also at the sensorimotor level (the way they perform\ntheir movements is not altered by the illusion, Kammers et al. 2009).\nPeacocke\u2019s (2017) agency-involving account may then seem the\nmost promising because it appeals to the notion of action at a\nrelatively high level of generality. On his view (Peacocke 2017: 293),\na subject can experience that this is her own hand if and only if:\n\nthere is a range of action notions A for which the creature\nmust be capable of being in mental states\u2026 with the content\nc is A-ing where the state\u2026 is produced by the\ninitiation of an A-ing by the reference of c;\nthere is a range of notions F of bodily properties, spatial\nproperties, and past tense properties F such that the creature\nis capable of being in mental states\u2026 with the content c\nis F; where in these attributions, c is F is\naccepted (in central basic cases) if and only if this body is F\nis also accepted.\n\n\nParalyzed patients still know what it is like to act and that should\nbe sufficient for them to still feel their inert limbs as their own\n(Peacocke 2019). One might also say that in the rubber hand illusion,\nparticipants know what it is like to act with a hand in general\nalthough they do not feel they could act with this specific rubber\nhand. However, this account puts so few constraints on what it\ntakes to experience one\u2019s body as one\u2019s own, that one may\nwonder how it is even possible to lose the sense of bodily ownership.\nWhat is the agency-involving difference between the paralyzed patients\nwho deny ownership and those who do not? \n",
