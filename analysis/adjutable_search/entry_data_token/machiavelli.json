That question might naturally and legitimately occur\nto anyone encountering an entry about him in an encyclopedia of\nphilosophy. Certainly, Machiavelli contributed to a large number of\nimportant discourses in Western thought\u2014political theory most\nnotably, but also history and historiography, Italian literature, the\nprinciples of warfare, and diplomacy. But Machiavelli never seems to\nhave considered himself a philosopher\u2014indeed, he often overtly\nrejected philosophical inquiry as beside the point\u2014nor do his\ncredentials suggest that he fits comfortably into standard models of\nacademic philosophy. His writings are maddeningly and notoriously\nunsystematic, inconsistent and sometimes self-contradictory. He tends\nto appeal to experience and example in the place of rigorous logical\nanalysis. Yet there are good reasons to include Machiavelli among the\ngreatest of political philosophers, some of which are internal to his\nwritings. In spite of the temptation to emphasize his political\npragmatism, a lively scholarly debate rages about the presence of a\ncoherent and original philosophy, addressed to topics of concern to\nphilosophers, at the core of his thought (Benner 2009; Zuckert 2017,\n2018; Baluch 2018; Bogiaris 2021).\n\nMoreover, succeeding thinkers who more obviously qualify as\nphilosophers of the first rank did (and still do) feel compelled to\nengage with his ideas, either to dispute them or to incorporate his\ninsights into their own teachings. Even if Machiavelli grazed at the\nfringes of philosophy, the impact of his extensive musings has been\nwidespread and lasting. The terms \u201cMachiavellian\u201d or\n\u201cMachiavellism\u201d find regular purchase among philosophers\nconcerned with a range of ethical, political, and psychological\nphenomena, regardless of whether or not Machiavelli himself invented\n\u201cMachiavellism\u201d (a term apparently coined by Pierre Bayle\nin the seventeenth century) or was in fact a\n\u201cMachiavellian\u201d in the sense commonly ascribed to him.\nMachiavelli\u2019s critique of utopian philosophical schemes (such as\nthose of Plato) challenges an entire tradition of political philosophy\nin a manner that commands attention and demands consideration and\nresponse. Finally, a new generation of so-called\n\u201cneo-Roman\u201d political theorists (such as Philip Pettit\n[1997], Quentin Skinner [1998] and Maurizio Viroli [1999 [2002]])\nfinds inspiration in Machiavelli\u2019s version of republicanism.\nThus, Machiavelli deserves a place at the table in any comprehensive\nsurvey of political philosophy.\n", "toc": [{"#Biog": "1.

Biography\n\nRelatively little is known for certain about Machiavelli\u2019s early\nlife in comparison with many important figures of the Italian\nRenaissance (the following section draws on Capponi 2010; Vivanti\n2013; Celenza 2015; Lee 2020) He was born 3 May 1469 in Florence and\nat a young age became a pupil of a renowned Latin teacher, Paolo da\nRonciglione. It is speculated that he attended the University of\nFlorence, and even a cursory glance at his corpus reveals that he\nreceived an excellent humanist education. It is only with his entrance\ninto public view, with his appointment in 1498 as the Second\nChancellor of the Republic of Florence, however, that we begin to\nacquire a full and accurate picture of his life. For the next fourteen\nyears, Machiavelli engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity on\nbehalf of Florence, traveling to the major centers of Italy as well as\nto the royal court of France and to the imperial curia of\nMaximilian.\n\nFlorence had been under a republican government since 1494, when the\nleading Medici family and its supporters had been driven from power.\nAfter four years under Savonarola\u2019s leadership (and eventual\ndownfall), the Florentine Republic sought more stable government and\nreformed its institutions accordingly. During this time, Machiavelli\nentered public service and thrived under the patronage of the\ncity\u2019s gonfaloniere (or chief administrator) for life,\nPiero Soderini, who was elected to that position in 1502. In his\nofficial capacities, Machiavelli travelled considerably, producing a\nlarge body of dispatches (known as the Legations) reporting\non events across Europe. He also composed personal correspondence,\npoetic works, and short political analyses (Nederman 2023). In 1512,\nhowever, with the assistance of Spanish and papal troops, the Medici\ndefeated the republic\u2019s civic militia (which Machiavelli had\norganized) and dissolved its government. Machiavelli was a direct\nvictim of the regime change: he was immediately dismissed from office\nand, when he was (wrongly) suspected of conspiring against the Medici,\nwas imprisoned and tortured for several weeks in early 1513. His\nretirement thereafter to his family farm outside of Florence afforded\nthe occasion and the impetus for him to turn to intellectual\npursuits.\n\nThe first of his writings in a more reflective vein was also\nultimately the one most commonly associated with his name, The\nPrince. Penned at the end of 1513 (and perhaps early 1514), but\nonly published posthumously in 1532, The Prince was composed\nin haste by an author who, among other things, sought to regain his\nstatus in Florentine political affairs. (Many of his colleagues in the\nprevious republican government were quickly rehabilitated and returned\nto service under the Medici.) Originally written for presentation to\nGiuliano de\u2019Medici (who may well have appreciated it), the\ndedication was changed, upon Giuliano\u2019s death, to Lorenzo\nde\u2019Medici (the Younger), who almost certainly did not read it\nwhen it came into his hands in 1516.\n\nMeanwhile, Machiavelli\u2019s retirement from politics led him to\nother literary activities. He wrote verse, plays, and short prose,\nauthored a study of The Art of War (published in 1521), and\nproduced biographical and historical sketches. Most importantly, he\ncomposed his other major contribution to political thought, the\nDiscourses on the Ten Books of Titus Livy, an exposition of\nthe principles of republican rule masquerading as a commentary on the\nwork of the famous historian of the Roman Republic. Unlike The\nPrince, the Discourses was written over a long period of\ntime (commencing perhaps in 1514 or 1515 and completed in 1518 or\n1519, although again only published posthumously in 1531). The book\nmay have been shaped by informal discussions attended by Machiavelli\namong some of the leading Florentine intellectual and political\nfigures under the sponsorship of Cosimo Rucellai.\n\nNear the end of his life, and probably as a result of the aid of\nwell-connected friends whom he never stopped badgering for\nintervention, Machiavelli began to return to the favor of the Medici\nfamily. In 1520, he was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio\nde\u2019Medici to compose a history of Florence (the so-called\nFlorentine Histories), an assignment completed in 1525 and\npresented to the Cardinal, who had since ascended to the papal throne\nas Clement VII, in Rome. Other small tasks were forthcoming from the\nMedici government, but before the opportunity arose for him to return\nfully to public life, he died on 21 June 1527.\n2. The Prince: Analyzing Power\n\nTraditionally, political philosophers of the past posited a special\nrelationship between moral goodness and legitimate authority. Many\nauthors (especially those who composed mirror-of-princes books or\nroyal advice books during the Middle Ages and Renaissance) believed\nthat the use of political power was only rightful if it was exercised\nby a ruler whose personal moral character was strictly virtuous. Thus\nrulers were counseled that if they wanted to succeed\u2014that is, if\nthey desired a long and peaceful reign and aimed to pass their office\ndown to their heirs\u2014they must be sure to behave in accordance\nwith conventional ethical standards, that is, the virtues and piety.\nIn a sense, it was thought that rulers did well when they did good;\nthey earned the right to be obeyed and respected on account of their\nmoral and religious rectitude (see Briggs and Nederman 2022).\n\nMachiavelli criticized at length precisely this moralistic view of\nauthority in his best-known treatise, The Prince. For\nMachiavelli, there is no moral basis on which to judge the difference\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate uses of power. Rather, authority\nand power are essentially coequal: whoever has power has the right to\ncommand; but goodness does not ensure power and the ruler has no more\nauthority on account of being good. Thus, in direct opposition to\nmorally derived theories of politics, Machiavelli says that the only\nreal concern in politics is the acquisition and maintenance of power\n(although he talks less about power per se than about\n\u201cmaintaining the state\u201d). In this sense, Machiavelli\npresents a trenchant criticism of the concept of authority by arguing\nthat the notion of legitimate rights of rulership adds nothing to the\nactual possession of power. The Prince purports to reflect\nthe self-conscious political realism of an author who is fully\naware\u2014on the basis of direct experience in the service of the\nFlorentine government\u2014that goodness and right are not sufficient\nto win and maintain political supremacy. Machiavelli thus seeks to\nlearn and teach the rules of political power. For him, it necessary\nfor any successful ruler to know how to use power effectively. Only by\nmeans of its proper application, Machiavelli believes, can individuals\nbe brought to obey and will the ruler be able to maintain the state in\nsafety and security.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s political theory, then, excludes issues of moral\nauthority and legitimacy from consideration in the discussion of\npolitical decision-making and political judgment. Nowhere does this\ncome out more clearly than in his treatment of the relationship\nbetween law and force. Machiavelli acknowledges that good laws and\ngood arms constitute the dual foundations of a well-ordered political\nsystem. But he immediately adds that since coercion creates legality,\nhe will concentrate his attention on force. He says, \u201cSince\nthere cannot be good laws without good arms, I will not consider laws\nbut speak of arms\u201d (Prince CW 47). In other words,\nvalid law rests entirely upon the threat of coercive force; authority\nis impossible for Machiavelli as a right apart from the power to\nenforce it. Machiavelli is led to conclude that fear is always\npreferable to affection in subjects, just as violence and deception\nare superior to legality in effectively controlling them. He observes\nthat\n\none can say this in general of men: they are ungrateful, disloyal,\ninsincere and deceitful, timid of danger and avid of profit\u2026.\nLove is a bond of obligation which these miserable creatures break\nwhenever it suits them to do so; but fear holds them fast by a dread\nof punishment that never passes. (Prince CW 62; translation\nrevised)\n\n\nAs a result, Machiavelli cannot really be said to have a theory of\nobligation separate from the imposition of power; people obey only\nbecause they fear the consequences of not doing so, whether the loss\nof life or of privileges. And of course, power alone cannot bind one,\ninasmuch as obligation is voluntary and assumes that one can\nmeaningfully do otherwise. Someone can choose not to obey only if he\npossesses the power to resist the ruler or is prepared to risk the\nconsequences of the state\u2019s superiority of coercive force.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s argument in The Prince is thus designed\nto demonstrate that politics can only properly be defined in terms of\nthe effective employment of coercive power, what Yes Winter (2018) has\ntermed \u201cthe orders of violence.\u201d Authority as a right to\ncommand has no independent status. He substantiates this assertion by\nreference to the observable realities\u2014historical and\ncontemporary\u2014of political affairs and public life as well as by\narguments revealing the self-interested tendencies of all human\nconduct. For Machiavelli it is meaningless and futile to speak of any\nclaim to the authority to command detached from the possession of\nsuperior political power. The ruler who lives by his supposed rights\nalone will surely wither and die by those same rights, because in the\nrough-and-tumble of political conflict those who prefer power to\nauthority are more likely to succeed. Without exception the authority\nof states and their laws will never be acknowledged when they are not\nsupported by a show of power which renders obedience inescapable.\n3. Power, Virt\u00f9, and Fortune\n\nMachiavelli presents to his readers a vision of political rule\nallegedly purged of extraneous moralizing influences and fully aware\nof the foundations of politics in the effective exercise of power. The\nmethods for achieving obedience are varied and depend heavily upon the\nforesight that the prince exercises. Hence, the successful ruler needs\nspecial training. The term that best captures Machiavelli\u2019s\nvision of skill that must be learned in order to engage successfully\nin power politics is virt\u00f9. While the Italian word\nwould normally be translated into English as \u201cvirtue\u201d, and\nwould ordinarily convey the conventional connotation of moral\ngoodness, Machiavelli obviously means something very different when he\nrefers to the virt\u00f9 of the prince. In particular,\nMachiavelli employs the concept of virt\u00f9 to refer to\nthe range of personal qualities that the prince will find it necessary\nto acquire in order to \u201cmaintain his state\u201d and to\n\u201cachieve great things\u201d, the two standard markers of power\nfor him. This makes it brutally clear there can be no equivalence\nbetween the conventional virtues and Machiavellian\nvirt\u00f9. Machiavelli\u2019s sense of what it is to be a\nperson of virt\u00f9 can thus be summarized by his\nrecommendation that the prince above all else must possess a\n\u201cflexible disposition\u201d. That ruler is best suited for\noffice, on Machiavelli\u2019s account, who is capable of varying\nher/his conduct from good to evil and back again \u201cas fortune and\ncircumstances dictate\u201d (Prince CW 66; see Nederman and\nBogiaris 2018).\n\nNot coincidentally, Machiavelli also uses the term\nvirt\u00f9 in his book The Art of War in order to\ndescribe the strategic prowess of the general who adapts to different\nbattlefield conditions as the situation dictates. Machiavelli sees\npolitics to be a sort of a battlefield on a different scale. Hence,\nthe prince just like the general needs to be in possession of\nvirt\u00f9, that is, to know which strategies and\ntechniques are appropriate to what particular circumstances (Wood\n1967). Thus, virt\u00f9 winds up being closely connected to\nMachiavelli\u2019s notion of the power. The ruler of\nvirt\u00f9 is bound to be competent in the application of\npower; to possess virt\u00f9 is indeed to have mastered all\nthe rules connected with the effective application of power.\nVirt\u00f9 is to power politics what conventional virtue is\nto those thinkers who suppose that moral goodness is sufficient to be\na legitimate ruler: it is the touchstone of political efficacy.\n\nWhat is the conceptual link between virt\u00f9 and the\neffective exercise of power for Machiavelli? The answer lies with\nanother central Machiavellian concept, Fortuna (usually\ntranslated as \u201cfortune\u201d). Fortuna is the enemy of\npolitical order, the ultimate threat to the safety and security of the\nstate. Machiavelli\u2019s use of the concept has been widely debated\nwithout a very satisfactory resolution. Suffice it to say that, as\nwith virt\u00f9, Fortuna is employed by him in a\ndistinctive way. Where conventional representations treated\nFortuna as a mostly benign, if fickle, goddess, who is the\nsource of human goods as well as evils, Machiavelli\u2019s fortune is\na malevolent and uncompromising fount of human misery, affliction, and\ndisaster. While human Fortuna may be responsible for such\nsuccess as human beings achieve, no man can act effectively when\ndirectly opposed by the Goddess (Discourses CW\n407\u2013408).\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s most famous discussion of Fortuna occurs\nin Chapter 25 of The Prince, in which he proposes two\nanalogies for understanding the human situation in the face of events.\nInitially, he asserts that fortune resembles\n\none of our destructive rivers which, when it is angry, turns the\nplains into lakes, throws down the trees and buildings, takes earth\nfrom one spot, puts it in another; everyone flees before the flood;\neveryone yields to its fury and nowhere can repel it.\n\n\nYet the furor of a raging river does not mean that its depredations\nare beyond human control: before the rains come, it is possible to\ntake precautions to divert the worst consequences of the natural\nelements. \u201cThe same things happen about Fortuna\u201d,\nMachiavelli observes,\n\nShe shows her power where virt\u00f9 and wisdom do not\nprepare to resist her and directs her fury where she knows that no\ndykes or embankments are ready to hold her. (Prince CW 90)\n\n\nFortune may be resisted by human beings, but only in those\ncircumstances where \u201cvirt\u00f9 and wisdom\u201d\nhave already prepared for her inevitable arrival.\n\nMachiavelli reinforces the association of Fortuna with the\nblind strength of nature by explaining that political success depends\nupon appreciation of the operational principles of Fortuna.\nHis own experience has taught him that\n\nit is better to be impetuous than cautious, because Fortuna\nis a woman and it is necessary, in order to keep her under, to beat\nand maul her.\n\n\nIn other words, Fortuna demands a violent response of those\nwho would control her. \u201cShe more often lets herself be overcome\nby men using such methods than by those who proceed coldly\u201d,\nMachiavelli continues, \u201ctherefore always, like a woman, she is\nthe friend of young men, because they are less cautious, more\nspirited, and with more boldness master her\u201d (Prince CW\n92). The wanton behavior of Fortuna demands an aggressive,\neven violent response, lest she take advantage of those men who are\ntoo retiring or \u201ceffeminate\u201d to dominate her.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s remarks point toward several salient conclusions\nabout Fortuna and her place in his intellectual universe.\nThroughout his corpus, Fortuna is depicted as a primal source\nof violence (especially as directed against humanity) and as\nantithetical to reason. Thus, Machiavelli realizes that only\npreparation to pose an extreme response to the vicissitudes of\nFortuna will ensure victory against her. This is what\nvirt\u00f9 provides: the ability to respond to fortune at\nany time and in any way that is necessary.\n4. Morality, Religion, and Politics\n\nThese basic building blocks of Machiavelli\u2019s thought have\ninduced considerable controversy among his readers going back to the\nsixteenth century, when he was denounced as an apostle of the Devil,\nbut also was read and applied sympathetically by authors (and\npoliticians) enunciating the doctrine of \u201creason of state\u201d\n(Meinecke 1924 [1957]). The main source of dispute concerned\nMachiavelli\u2019s attitude toward conventional moral and religious\nstandards of human conduct, mainly in connection with The\nPrince. For many, his teaching endorses immoralism or, at least,\namoralism. The most extreme versions of this reading find Machiavelli\nto be a \u201cteacher of evil\u201d, in the famous words of Leo\nStrauss (1958: 9\u201310), on the grounds that he counsels leaders to\navoid the common values of justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and\nlove of their people in preference to the use of cruelty, violence,\nfear, and deception. A more moderate school of thought, associated\nwith Benedetto Croce (1925), views Machiavelli as simply a\n\u201crealist\u201d or a \u201cpragmatist\u201d advocating the\nsuspension of commonplace ethics in matters of politics. Moral values\nhave no place in the sorts of decisions that political leaders must\nmake, and it is a category error of the gravest sort to think\notherwise. Perhaps the mildest version of the amoral hypothesis has\nbeen proposed by Quentin Skinner (1978), who claims that the\nruler\u2019s commission of acts deemed vicious by convention is a\n\u201clast best\u201d option. Concentrating on the claim in The\nPrince that a head of state ought to do good if he can but must\nbe prepared to commit evil if he must (Prince CW 58), Skinner\nargues that Machiavelli prefers conformity to moral virtue ceteris\nparibus.\n\nDisinterest in ethical concerns also permeates the claim, popular in\nthe early- and mid-twentieth century, that Machiavelli simply adopts\nthe stance of a scientist\u2014a kind of \u201cGalileo of\npolitics\u201d\u2014in distinguishing between the\n\u201cfacts\u201d of political life and the \u201cvalues\u201d of\nmoral judgment (Olschki 1945; Cassirer 1946; Prezzolini 1954 [1967]).\nHe is thereby set into the context of the scientific revolution more\ngenerally. The point of Machiavellian \u201cscience\u201d is not to\ndistinguish between \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cunjust\u201d forms\nof government, but to explain how politicians deploy power for their\nown gain. Thus, Machiavelli rises to the mantle of the founder of\n\u201cmodern\u201d political science, in contrast with\nAristotle\u2019s classical norm-laden vision of a political science\nof virtue. More recently, the Machiavelli-as-scientist interpretation\nhas largely gone out of favor (Viroli 1998 1\u20133), although some\nhave recently found merit in a revised version of the thesis (e.g.,\nDyer and Nederman 2016).\n\nOther of Machiavelli\u2019s readers have found no taint of immorality\nor amoralism in his thought whatsoever. Jean-Jacques Rousseau long ago\nheld that the real lesson of The Prince is to teach the\npeople the truth about how princes behave and thus to expose, rather\nthan celebrate, the immorality at the core of one-man rule (quoted in\nConnell 2005, 178). Various versions of this thesis have been\ndisseminated more recently. Some scholars, such as Garrett Mattingly\n(1958), have pronounced Machiavelli the supreme satirist, pointing out\nthe foibles of princes and their advisors. The fact that Machiavelli\nlater wrote biting popular stage comedies is cited as evidence in\nsupport of his strong satirical bent. Thus, we should take nothing\nMachiavelli says about moral conduct at face value, but instead should\nunderstand his remarks as sharply humorous commentary on public\naffairs. Alternatively, Mary Deitz (1986) asserts that\nMachiavelli\u2019s agenda was driven by a desire to\n\u201ctrap\u201d the prince by offering carefully crafted advice\n(such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken\nseriously and followed.\n\nA similar range of opinions exists in connection with\nMachiavelli\u2019s attitude toward religion in general, and\nChristianity in particular. Machiavelli was no friend of the\ninstitutionalized Christian Church as he knew it. The\nDiscourses makes clear that conventional Christianity saps\nfrom human beings the vigor required for active civil life (CW\n228\u2013229, 330\u2013331). And The Prince speaks with\nequal parts disdain and admiration about the contemporary condition of\nthe Church and its Pope (CW 29, 44\u201346, 65, 91\u201392). Many\nscholars have taken such evidence to indicate that Machiavelli was\nhimself profoundly anti-Christian, preferring the pagan civil\nreligions of ancient societies such as Rome, which he regarded to be\nmore suitable for a city endowed with virt\u00f9. Anthony\nParel (1992) argues that Machiavelli\u2019s cosmos, governed by the\nmovements of the stars and the balance of the humors, takes on an\nessentially pagan and pre-Christian cast. For others, Machiavelli may\nbest be described as a man of conventional, if unenthusiastic, piety,\nprepared to bow to the externalities of worship but not deeply devoted\nin either soul or mind to the tenets of Christian faith. A few\ndissenting voices, most notably Sebastian de Grazia (1989) and\nMaurizio Viroli (2006 [2010]), have attempted to rescue\nMachiavelli\u2019s reputation from those who view him as hostile or\nindifferent to Christianity. Grazia demonstrates how central biblical\nthemes run throughout Machiavelli\u2019s writings, finding there a\ncoherent conception of a divinely centered and ordered cosmos in which\nother forces (\u201cthe heavens\u201d, \u201cfortune\u201d, and\nthe like) are subsumed under a divine will and plan. Cary Nederman\nextends and systematizes Grazia\u2019s insights by showing how such\ncentral Christian theological doctrines as grace, free will and prayer\nform important elements of Machiavelli\u2019s conceptual framework\n(2009: 28\u201349; Nederman and Lahoud 2023). Viroli considers, by\ncontrast, the historical attitudes toward the Christian religion as\nmanifested in the Florentine republic of Machiavelli\u2019s day.\n5. The State and the Prince: Language and Concepts\n\nMachiavelli has also been credited (most recently by Skinner 1978)\nwith formulating for the first time the \u201cmodern concept of the\nstate\u201d, understood in the broadly Weberian sense of an\nimpersonal form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority\nwithin a fixed territorial boundaries. Certainly, the term lo\nstato appears widely in Machiavelli\u2019s writings, especially\nin The Prince, in connection with the acquisition and\napplication of power in a coercive sense, which renders its meaning\ndistinct from the Latin term status (condition or station)\nfrom which it is derived. Moreover, scholars cite Machiavelli\u2019s\ninfluence in shaping the early modern debates surrounding\n\u201creason of state\u201d\u2014the doctrine that the good of the\nstate itself takes precedence over all other considerations, whether\nmorality or the good of citizens\u2014as evidence that he was\nreceived by his near-contemporaries as a theorist of the state\n(Meineke 1924 [1957]). Machiavelli\u2019s name and doctrines were\nwidely invoked to justify the priority of the interests of the state\nin the age of absolutism.\n\nYet, as Harvey Mansfield (1996) has shown, a careful reading of\nMachiavelli\u2019s use of lo stato in The Prince\nand elsewhere does not support this interpretation.\nMachiavelli\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d remains a personal patrimony,\na possession more in line with the medieval conception of\ndominium as the foundation of rule. (Dominium is a\nLatin term that may be translated with equal force as \u201cprivate\nproperty\u201d and as \u201cpolitical dominion\u201d.) Thus, the\n\u201cstate\u201d is literally owned by whichever prince happens to\nhave control of it. Moreover, the character of governance is\ndetermined by the personal qualities and traits of the\nruler\u2014hence, Machiavelli\u2019s emphasis on\nvirt\u00f9 as indispensable for the prince\u2019s success.\nThese aspects of the deployment of lo stato in The\nPrince mitigate against the \u201cmodernity\u201d of his idea.\nMachiavelli is at best a transitional figure in the process by which\nthe language of the state emerged in early modern Europe, as Mansfield\nconcludes.\n\nAnother factor that must be kept in mind when evaluating the general\napplicability of Machiavelli\u2019s theory in The Prince\nstems from the very situation in which his prince of\nvirt\u00f9 operates. Such a ruler comes to power not by\ndynastic inheritance or on the back of popular support, but purely as\na result of his own initiative, skill, talent, and/or strength (all\nwords that are English equivalents for virt\u00f9,\ndependent upon where it occurs in the text). Thus, the Machiavellian\nprince can count on no pre-existing structures of legitimation, as\ndiscussed above. In order to \u201cmaintain his state\u201d, then,\nhe can only rely upon his own fount of personal characteristics to\ndirect the use of power and establish his claim on rulership. This is\na precarious position, since Machiavelli insists that the throes of\nfortune and the conspiracies of other men render the prince constantly\nvulnerable to the loss of his state. The idea of a stable\nconstitutional regime that reflects the tenor of modern political\nthought (and practice) is nowhere to be seen in Machiavelli\u2019s\nconception of princely government.\n\nIndeed, one might wonder whether Machiavelli, for all of his alleged\nrealism, actually believed that a prince of complete\nvirt\u00f9 could in fact exist. He sometimes seems to\nimagine that a successful prince would have to develop a psychology\nentirely different from that known hitherto to mankind, inasmuch as\nthis \u201cnew\u201d prince is\n\nprepared to vary his conduct as the winds of fortune and changing\ncircumstances constrain him and \u2026 not deviate from right\nconduct if possible, but be capable of entering upon the path of\nwrongdoing when this becomes necessary. (MP 62)\n\n\nThis flexibility yields the core of the \u201cpractical\u201d advice\nthat Machiavelli offers to the ruler seeking to maintain his state:\nexclude no course of action out of hand, but be ready always to\nperform whatever acts are required by political circumstance.\n\nYet Machiavelli himself apparently harbored severe doubts about\nwhether human beings were psychologically capable of generating such\nflexible dispositions within themselves. In spite of the great number\nof his historical examples, Machiavelli can point in The\nPrince to no single ruler who evinced the sort of variable\nvirt\u00f9 that he deems necessary for the complete control\nof fortune. Rather, his case studies of successful rulers repeatedly\npoint to the situation of a prince whose characteristics suited his\ntimes but whose consistency of conduct (as in the case of Pope Julius\nII) \u201cwould have brought about his downfall\u201d if\ncircumstances had changed (Prince CW 92). Even the Emperor\nSeverus, whose techniques Machiavelli lauds, succeeded because he\nemployed \u201cthe courses of action that are necessary for\nestablishing himself in power\u201d; he is not, however, to be\nimitated universally (Prince CW 73). Machiavelli\u2019s\nevaluation of the chances for creating a new, psychologically flexible\ntype of character is extremely guarded, and tends to be worded in\nconditional form and in the subjective mood: \u201cIf it were\npossible to change one\u2019s nature to suit the times and\ncircumstances, one would always be successful\u201d (Prince\nCW 91, translation revised). Such observations must make us wonder\nwhether Machiavelli\u2019s advice that princes acquire dispositions\nwhich vary according to circumstance was so \u201cpractical\u201d\n(even in his own mind) as he had asserted.\n6. The Discourses on Livy: Liberty and Conflict\n\nWhile The Prince is doubtless the most widely read of his\nworks, the Discourses on the Ten Books of Titus Livy perhaps\nmost honestly expresses Machiavelli\u2019s personal political beliefs\nand commitments, in particular, his republican sympathies. The\nDiscourses certainly draw upon the same reservoir of language\nand concepts that flowed into The Prince, but the former\ntreatise leads us to draw conclusions quite different from\u2014many\nscholars have said contradictory to\u2014the latter. In particular,\nacross the two works, Machiavelli consistently and clearly\ndistinguishes between a minimal and a full conception of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201ccivil\u201d order, and thus\nconstructs a hierarchy of ends within his general account of communal\nlife. A minimal constitutional order is one in which subjects live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro), ruled by a strong\ngovernment which holds in check the aspirations of both nobility\n(grandi) and people (Popolo), but is in turn\nbalanced by other legal and institutional mechanisms. In a fully\nconstitutional regime, however, the goal of the political order is the\nfreedom of the community (vivere libero), created by\nthe active participation of, and contention between, the nobility and\nthe people (Pedull\u00e0 2011 [2018]). As Quentin Skinner (2002,\n189\u2013212) has argued, liberty forms a value that anchors\nMachiavelli\u2019s political theory and guides his evaluations of the\nworthiness of different types of regimes. Only in a republic, for\nwhich Machiavelli expresses a distinct preference, may this goal be\nattained.\n\nMachiavelli adopted this position on both pragmatic and principled\ngrounds. During his career as a secretary and diplomat in the\nFlorentine republic, he came to acquire vast experience of the inner\nworkings of French government, which became his model for the\n\u201csecure\u201d (but not free) polity. Although Machiavelli makes\nrelatively little comment about the French monarchy in The\nPrince, he devotes a great deal of attention to France in the\nDiscourses.\n\nWhy would Machiavelli effusively praise (let alone even analyze) a\nhereditary monarchy in a work supposedly designed to promote the\nsuperiority of republics? The answer stems from Machiavelli\u2019s\naim to contrast the best-case scenario of a monarchic regime with the\ninstitutions and organization of a republic. Even the most excellent\nmonarchy, in Machiavelli\u2019s view, lacks certain salient qualities\nthat are endemic to properly constituted republican government and\nthat make the latter constitution more desirable than the former.\n\nMachiavelli asserts that the greatest virtue of the French kingdom and\nits king is the dedication to law. \u201cThe kingdom of France is\nmoderated more by laws than any other kingdom of which at our time we\nhave knowledge\u201d, Machiavelli declares (Discourses CW\n314, translation revised). The explanation for this situation\nMachiavelli refers to the function of the Parlement. \u201cThe\nkingdom of France\u201d, he states,\n\nlives under laws and orders more than any other kingdom. These laws\nand orders are maintained by Parlements, notably that of Paris: by it\nthey are renewed any time it acts against a prince of the kingdom or\nin its sentences condemns the king. And up to now it has maintained\nitself by having been a persistent executor against that nobility.\n(Discourses CW 422, translation revised)\n\n\nThese passages of the Discourses suggest that Machiavelli has\ngreat admiration for the institutional arrangements that obtain in\nFrance (Nederman 2023: 52\u201355). Specifically, the French king and\nthe nobles, whose power is such that they would be able to oppress the\npopulace, are checked by the laws of the realm which are enforced by\nthe independent authority of the Parlement. Thus, opportunities for\nunbridled tyrannical conduct are largely eliminated, rendering the\nmonarchy temperate and \u201ccivil\u201d.\n\nYet such a regime, no matter how well ordered and law-abiding, remains\nincompatible with vivere libero. Discussing the\nability of a monarch to meet the people\u2019s wish for liberty,\nMachiavelli comments that\n\nas far as the \u2026 popular desire of recovering their liberty, the\nprince, not being able to satisfy them, must examine what the reasons\nare that make them desire being free. (Discourses CW 237).\n\n\nHe concludes that a few individuals want freedom simply in order to\ncommand others; these, he believes, are of sufficiently small number\nthat they can either be eradicated or bought off with honors. By\ncontrast, the vast majority of people confuse liberty with security,\nimagining that the former is identical to the latter: \u201cBut all\nthe others, who are infinite, desire liberty in order to live securely\n(vivere sicuro)\u201d (Discourses CW 237).\nAlthough the king cannot give such liberty to the masses, he can\nprovide the security that they crave:\n\nAs for the rest, for whom it is enough to live securely\n(vivere sicuro), they are easily satisfied by making\norders and laws that, along with the power of the king, comprehend\neveryone\u2019s security. And once a prince does this, and the people\nsee that he never breaks such laws, they will shortly begin to live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro) and contentedly\n(Discourses CW 237).\n\n\nMachiavelli then applies this general principle directly to the case\nof France, remarking that\n\nthe people live securely (vivere sicuro) for no\nother reason than that its kings are bound to infinite laws in which\nthe security of all their people is comprehended. (Discourses\nCW 237)\n\n\nThe law-abiding character of the French regime ensures security, but\nthat security, while desirable, ought never to be confused with\nliberty. This is the limit of monarchic rule: even the best kingdom\ncan do no better than to guarantee to its people tranquil and orderly\ngovernment.\n\nMachiavelli holds that one of the consequences of such vivere\nsicuro is the disarmament of the people. He comments that\nregardless of \u201chow great his kingdom is\u201d, the king of\nFrance \u201clives as a tributary\u201d to foreign mercenaries.\n\nThis all comes from having disarmed his people and having preferred\n\u2026 to enjoy the immediate profit of being able to plunder the\npeople and of avoiding an imaginary rather than a real danger, instead\nof doing things that would assure them and make their states\nperpetually happy. This disorder, if it produces some quiet times, is\nin time the cause of straitened circumstances, damage and irreparable\nruin (Discourses CW 410).\n\n\nA state that makes security a priority cannot afford to arm its\npopulace, for fear that the masses will employ their weapons against\nthe nobility (or perhaps the crown). Yet at the same time, such a\nregime is weakened irredeemably, since it must depend upon foreigners\nto fight on its behalf. In this sense, any government that takes\nvivere sicuro as its goal generates a passive and\nimpotent populace as an inescapable result. By definition, such a\nsociety can never be free in Machiavelli\u2019s sense of\nvivere libero, and hence is only minimally, rather\nthan completely, political or civil.\n\nConfirmation of this interpretation of the limits of monarchy for\nMachiavelli may be found in his further discussion of the disarmament\nof the people, and its effects, in The Art of War. Addressing\nthe question of whether a citizen army is to be preferred to a\nmercenary one, he insists that the liberty of a state is contingent\nupon the military preparedness of its subjects. Acknowledging that\n\u201cthe king [of France] has disarmed his people in order to be\nable to command them more easily\u201d, Machiavelli still concludes\n\u201cthat such a policy is \u2026 a defect in that kingdom, for\nfailure to attend to this matter is the one thing that makes her\nweak\u201d (Art CW 584, 586\u2013587). In his view,\nwhatever benefits may accrue to a state by denying a military role to\nthe people are of less importance than the absence of liberty that\nnecessarily accompanies such disarmament. The problem is not merely\nthat the ruler of a disarmed nation is in thrall to the military\nprowess of foreigners. More crucially, Machiavelli believes, a\nweapons-bearing citizen militia remains the ultimate assurance that\nneither the government nor some usurper will tyrannize the populace:\n\u201cSo Rome was free four hundred years and was armed; Sparta,\neight hundred; many other cities have been unarmed and free less than\nforty years\u201d (Art CW 585). Machiavelli is confident\nthat citizens will always fight for their liberty\u2014against\ninternal as well as external oppressors. Indeed, this is precisely why\nsuccessive French monarchs have left their people disarmed: they\nsought to maintain public security and order, which for them meant the\nelimination of any opportunities for their subjects to wield arms. The\nFrench regime, because it seeks security above all else (for the\npeople as well as for their rulers), cannot permit what Machiavelli\ntakes to be a primary means of promoting liberty.\n\nThe case of disarmament is an illustration of a larger difference\nbetween minimally constitutional systems such as France and fully\npolitical communities such as the Roman Republic, namely, the status\nof the classes within the society. In France, the people are entirely\npassive and the nobility is largely dependent upon the king, according\nto Machiavelli\u2019s own observations. By contrast, in a fully\ndeveloped republic such as Rome\u2019s, where the actualization of\nliberty is paramount, both the people and the nobility take an active\n(and sometimes clashing) role in self-government (McCormick 2011;\nHolman 2018). The liberty of the whole, for Machiavelli, depends upon\nthe liberty of its component parts. In his famous discussion of this\nsubject in the Discourses, he remarks,\n\nTo me those who condemn the tumults between the Nobles and the Plebs\nseem to be caviling at the very thing that was the primary cause of\nRome\u2019s retention of liberty\u2026. And they do not realize\nthat in every republic there are two different dispositions, that of\nthe people and that of the great men, and that all legislation\nfavoring liberty is brought about by their dissension\n(Discourses CW 202\u2013203).\n\n\nMachiavelli knows that he is adopting an unusual perspective here,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. But\nMachiavelli holds that precisely the same conflicts generated a\n\u201ccreative tension\u201d that was the source of Roman liberty.\nFor \u201cthose very tumults that so many inconsiderately\ncondemn\u201d directly generated the good laws of Rome and the\nvirtuous conduct of its citizens (Discourses CW 202).\nHence,\n\nEnmities between the people and the Senate should, therefore, be\nlooked upon as an inconvenience which it is necessary to put up with\nin order to arrive at the greatness of Rome. (Discourses CW\n211)\n\n\nMachiavelli thinks that other republican models (such as those adopted\nby Sparta or Venice) will produce weaker and less successful political\nsystems, ones that are either stagnant or prone to decay when\ncircumstances change.\n7. Popular Liberty and Popular Speech\n\nMachiavelli evinces particular confidence in the capacity of the\npeople to contribute to the promotion of communal liberty. In the\nDiscourses, he ascribes to the masses a quite extensive\ncompetence to judge and act for the public good in various settings,\nexplicitly contrasting the \u201cprudence and stability\u201d of\nordinary citizens with the unsound discretion of the prince. Simply\nstated, \u201cA people is more prudent, more stable, and of better\njudgment than a prince\u201d (Discourses CW 316). This is\nnot an arbitrary expression of personal preference on\nMachiavelli\u2019s part. He maintains that the people are more\nconcerned about, and more willing to defend, liberty than either\nprinces or nobles (Discourses CW 204\u2013205). Where the\nlatter confuse their liberty with their ability to dominate and\ncontrol the popolo, the masses are more concerned with\nprotecting themselves against oppression and consider themselves\n\u201cfree\u201d when they are not abused by the more powerful or\nthreatened with such abuse (Discourses CW 203). In turn, when\nthey fear the onset of such oppression, ordinary citizens are more\ninclined to object and to defend the common liberty. Such an active\nrole for the people, while necessary for the maintenance of vital\npublic liberty, is fundamentally antithetical to the hierarchical\nstructure of subordination-and-rule on which monarchic vivere\nsicuro rests. The preconditions of vivere\nlibero simply do not favor the security that is the aim of\nconstitutional monarchy.\n\nOne of the main reasons that security and liberty remain, in the end,\nincompatible for Machiavelli\u2014and that the latter is to be\npreferred\u2014may surely be traced to the \u201crhetorical\u201d\ncharacter of his republicanism. Machiavelli clearly views speech as\nthe method most appropriate to the resolution of conflict in the\nrepublican public sphere; throughout the Discourses, debate\nis elevated as the best means for the people to determine the wisest\ncourse of action and the most qualified leaders. The tradition of\nclassical rhetoric, with which he was evidently familiar, directly\nassociated public speaking with contention: the proper application of\nspeech in the realms of forensic and deliberative genres of rhetoric\nis an adversarial setting, with each speaker seeking to convince his\naudience of the validity of his own position and the unworthiness of\nhis opponents\u2019. This theme was taken up, in turn, by late\nmedieval Italian practitioners and theorists of rhetoric, who\nemphasized that the subject matter of the art was lite\n(conflict). Thus, Machiavelli\u2019s insistence upon contention as a\nprerequisite of liberty also reflects his rhetorical predilections\n(Viroli 1998). By contrast, monarchic regimes\u2014even the most\nsecure monarchies such as France\u2014exclude or limit public\ndiscourse, thereby placing themselves at a distinct disadvantage. It\nis far easier to convince a single ruler to undertake a disastrous or\nill-conceived course of action than a multitude of people. The\napparent \u201ctumult\u201d induced by the uncertain liberty of\npublic discussion eventually renders more likely a decision conducive\nto the common good than does the closed conversation of the royal\ncourt.\n\nThis connects to the claim in the Discourses that the popular\nelements within the community form the best safeguard of civic liberty\nas well as the most reliable source of decision-making about the\npublic good. Machiavelli\u2019s praise for the role of the people in\nsecuring the republic is supported by his confidence in the generally\nilluminating effects of public speech upon the citizen body. Near the\nbeginning of the first Discourses, he notes that some may\nobject to the extensive freedom enjoyed by the Roman people to\nassemble, to protest, and to veto laws and policies. But he responds\nthat the Romans were able to\n\nmaintain liberty and order because of the people\u2019s ability to\ndiscern the common good when it was shown to them. At times when\nordinary Roman citizens wrongly supposed that a law or institution was\ndesigned to oppress them, they could be persuaded that their beliefs\nare mistaken \u2026 [through] the remedy of assemblies, in which\nsome man of influence gets up and makes a speech showing them how they\nare deceiving themselves. And as Tully says, the people, although they\nmay be ignorant, can grasp the truth, and yield easily when told what\nis true by a trustworthy man (Discourses CW 203).\n\n\nThe reference to Tully, that is, Cicero (one of the few in the\nDiscourses) confirms that Machiavelli has in mind here a key\nfeature of classical republicanism: the competence of the people to\nrespond to and support the words of the gifted orator when he speaks\ntruly about the public welfare.\n\nMachiavelli returns to this theme and treats it more extensively at\nthe end of the first Discourse. In a chapter intended to\ndemonstrate the superiority of popular over princely government, he\nargues that the people are well ordered, and hence \u201cprudent,\nstable and grateful\u201d, so long as room is made for public speech\nand deliberation within the community. Citing the formula vox\npopuli, vox dei, Machiavelli insists that\n\npublic opinion is remarkably accurate in its prognostications\u2026.\nWith regard to its judgment, when two speakers of equal skill are\nheard advocating different alternatives, very rarely does one find the\npeople failing to adopt the better view or incapable of appreciating\nthe truth of what it hears (Discourses CW 316).\n\n\nNot only are the people competent to discern the best course of action\nwhen orators lay out competing plans, but they are in fact better\nqualified to make decisions, in Machiavelli\u2019s view, than are\nprinces. For example,\n\nthe people can never be persuaded that it is good to appoint to an\noffice a man of infamous or corrupt habits, whereas a prince may\neasily and in a vast variety of ways be persuaded to do this.\n(Discourses CW 316)\n\n\nLikewise, should the people depart from the law-abiding path, they may\nreadily be convinced to restore order:\n\nFor an uncontrolled and tumultuous people can be spoken to by a good\nman and easily led back into a good way. But no one can speak to a\nwicked prince, and the only remedy is steel\u2026. To cure the\nmalady of the people words are enough. (Discourses CW 317)\n\n\nThe contrast Machiavelli draws is stark. The republic governed by\nwords and persuasion\u2014in sum, ruled by public speech\u2014is\nalmost sure to realize the common good of its citizens; and even\nshould it err, recourse is always open to further discourse.\nNon-republican regimes, because they exclude or limit discursive\npractices, ultimately rest upon coercive domination and can only be\ncorrected by violent means.\n8. The Character of Republican Leaders\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s arguments in favor of republican regimes also\nappeal to his skeptical stance toward the acquisition of\nvirt\u00f9 by any single individual, and hence the\nimplication that a truly stable principality may never be attainable.\nThe effect of the Machiavellian dichotomy between the need for\nflexibility and the inescapable constancy of character is to\ndemonstrate an inherent practical limitation in single-ruler regimes.\nFor the reader is readily led to the conclusion that, just because\nhuman conduct is rooted in a firm and invariant character, the rule of\na single man is intrinsically unstable and precarious. In the\nDiscourses, Machiavelli provides a psychological case that\nthe realities of human character tend to favor a republic over a\nprincipality, since the former \u201cis better able to adapt itself\nto diverse circumstances than a prince owing to the diversity found\namong its citizens\u201d (Discourses CW 253).\n\nMachiavelli illustrates this claim by reference to the evolution of\nRoman military strategy against Hannibal. After the first flush of the\nCarthaginian general\u2019s victories in Italy, the circumstances of\nthe Roman required a circumspect and cautious leader who would not\ncommit the legions to aggressive military action for which they were\nnot prepared. Such leadership emerged in the person of Fabius Maximus,\n\u201ca general who by his slowness and his caution held the enemy at\nbay. Nor could he have met with circumstances more suited to his\nways\u201d (Discourses CW 452). Yet when a more offensive\nstance was demanded to defeat Hannibal, the Roman Republic was able to\nturn to the leadership of Scipio, whose personal qualities were more\nfitted to the times. Neither Fabius nor Scipio was able to escape\n\u201chis ways and habits\u201d (Discourses CW 452), but\nthe fact that Rome could call on each at the appropriate moment\nsuggests to Machiavelli an inherent strength of the republican\nsystem.\n\nIf Fabius had been king of Rome, he might easily have lost this war,\nsince he was incapable of altering his methods according as\ncircumstance changed. Since, however, he was born in a republic where\nthere were diverse citizens with diverse dispositions, it came about\nthat, just as it had a Fabius, who was the best man to keep the war\ngoing when circumstances required it, so later it had a Scipio at a\ntime suited to its victorious consummation (Discourses CW\n452).\n\n\nChanging events require flexibility of response, and since it is\npsychologically implausible for human character to change with the\ntimes, the republic offers a viable alternative: people of different\nqualities fit different exigencies. The diversity characteristic of\ncivic regimes, which was so reviled by Machiavelli\u2019s\npredecessors, proves to be an abiding advantage of republics over\nprincipalities.\n\nThis does not mean that Machiavelli\u2019s confidence in the capacity\nof republican government to redress the political shortcomings of\nhuman character was unbridled. After all, he gives us no real\nindication of how republics manage to identify and authorize the\nleaders whose qualities are suited to the circumstances. It is one\nthing to observe that such variability has occurred within republics,\nquite another to demonstrate that this is a necessary or essential\nfeature of the republican system. At best, then, Machiavelli offers us\na kind of empirical generalization, the theoretical foundations of\nwhich he leaves unexplored. And the Discourses points out\nthat republics have their own intrinsic limitation in regard to the\nflexibility of response needed to conquer fortune. For just as with\nindividual human beings, it is difficult (if not impossible) to change\ntheir personal characteristics, so\n\ninstitutions in republics do not change with the times \u2026 but\nchange very slowly because it is more painful to change them since it\nis necessary to wait until the whole republic is in a state of\nupheaval; and for this it is not enough that one man alone should\nchange his own procedure. (Discourses CW 453)\n\nIf the downfall of principalities is the fixed structure of human\ncharacter, then the failing of republics is a devotion to the\nperpetuation of institutional arrangements whose time has passed.\nWhether it is any more plausible to hold out hope for the creation of\nmore responsive republican institutions than to demand flexibility in\nthe personal qualities of princes is not directly examined by the\nDiscourses.\n\nMachiavelli thus seems to adhere to a genuinely republican position.\nBut how are we to square this with his statements in The\nPrince? It is tempting to dismiss The Prince as an\ninauthentic expression of Machiavelli\u2019s \u201creal\u201d views\nand preferences, written over a short period in order to prove his\npolitical value to the returned Medici masters of Florence. (This is\ncontrasted with the lengthy composition process of the\nDiscourses.) Yet Machiavelli never repudiated The\nPrince, and indeed refers to it in the Discourses in a\nway that suggests he viewed the former as a companion to the latter.\nAlthough there has been much debate about whether Machiavelli was\ntruly a friend of princes and tyrants or of republics, and hence\nwhether we should dismiss one or another facet of his writing as\nancillary or peripheral, the questions seems irresolvable. Mark\nHulliung\u2019s suggestion that \u201cboth\u201d Machiavellis need\nto be lent equal weight thus enjoys a certain plausibility (Hulliung\n1983).\n9. Machiavelli\u2019s Place in Western Thought\n\nWhat is \u201cmodern\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d in\nMachiavelli\u2019s thought? What is Machiavelli\u2019s\n\u201cplace\u201d in the history of Western ideas? The body of\nliterature debating this question, especially in connection with\nThe Prince and Discourses, has grown to truly\nstaggering proportions. John Pocock (1975), for example, has traced\nthe diffusion of Machiavelli\u2019s republican thought throughout the\nso-called Atlantic world and, specifically, into the ideas that guided\nthe framers of the American constitution. Paul Rahe (2008) argues for\na similar set of influences, but with an intellectual substance and\nsignificance different from Pocock. For Pocock, Machiavelli\u2019s\nrepublicanism is of a civic humanist variety whose roots are to be\nfound in classical antiquity; for Rahe, Machiavelli\u2019s\nrepublicanism is entirely novel and modern. The\n\u201cneo-Roman\u201d thinkers (most prominently, Pettit, Skinner\nand Viroli) appropriate Machiavelli as a source of their principle of\n\u201cfreedom as non-domination\u201d, while he has also been put to\nwork in the defense of democratic precepts and values (McCormick\n2011). Likewise, cases have been made for Machiavelli\u2019s\npolitical morality, his conception of the state, his religious views,\nand many other features of his work as the distinctive basis for the\noriginality of his contribution.\n\nYet few firm conclusions have emerged within scholarship. (The\nunsettled state of play in current research on Machiavelli is well\nrepresented in Johnston et al. 2017.) One plausible explanation for\nthe inability to resolve these issues of \u201cmodernity\u201d and\n\u201coriginality\u201d is that Machiavelli was in a sense trapped\nbetween innovation and tradition, between via antiqua and\nvia moderna (to adopt the usage of Janet Coleman 1995), in a\nway that generated internal conceptual tensions within his thought as\na whole and even within individual texts (Nederman 2009). This\nhistorical ambiguity permits scholars to make equally convincing cases\nfor contradictory claims about his fundamental stance without\nappearing to commit egregious violence to his doctrines. This point\ndiffers from the accusation made by certain scholars that Machiavelli\nwas fundamentally inconsistent (see Black 2022) or simply driven by\n\u201clocal\u201d agendas (Celenza 2015). Rather, salient features\nof the distinctively Machiavellian approach to politics should be\ncredited to an incongruity between historical circumstance and\nintellectual possibility. What makes Machiavelli a troubling yet\nstimulating thinker is that, in his attempt to draw different\nconclusions from the commonplace expectations of his audience, he\nstill incorporated important features of precisely the conventions he\nwas challenging. In spite of his repeated assertion of his own\noriginality (for instance, Prince CW 10, 57\u201358), his\ncareful attention to preexisting traditions meant that he was never\nfully able to escape his intellectual confines.
