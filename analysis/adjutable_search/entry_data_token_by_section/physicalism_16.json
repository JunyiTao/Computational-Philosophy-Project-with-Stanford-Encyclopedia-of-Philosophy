    "main_text": "The Condition Question || Physicalism as an Attitude\n4.7 Physicalism as an Attitude\n\nIn view of the difficulties posed by Hempel\u2019s dilemma and\nrelated problems, some philosophers have explored the interesting idea\nthat to be a physicalist is not to hold some thesis or belief \u2013\nthat is, to hold something that may be true or false \u2013 but is\nrather to adopt a kind of attitude or stance. As Alyssa Ney (2008, p.\n9, see also Van Fraassen 2002) develops this \u201cattitudinal\u201d\nview, for example, \u201cphysicalism is an attitude one takes to form\none\u2019s ontology completely and solely according to what physics\nsays exists\u201d. \n\nNow, as with other ideas we have looked at, there is certainly\nsomething right about the attitudinal view. As we will see below,\ncontemporary physicalists are often methodological naturalists, and\nmethodological naturalists may well hold the attitude Ney describes.\nNevertheless, there is a major problem for the view, viz., that on the\nface of it holding this sort of attitude is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for being a physicalist. \n\nTo see it is not necessary, consider such ancient philosophers as\nDemocritus or Lucretius. These philosophers are physicalists, or at\nleast are usually classified that way, i.e., since they held the\ndoctrine traditionally called \u2018materialism\u2019. But they did\nnot hold the attitude Ney describes, either implicitly or explicitly,\nfor physics (at least identified sociologically) did not exist in\ntheir day at all.\n\nIn response, one might adjust the attitudinal view so that the\n\u2018physics\u2019 towards which one holds the relevant attitude is\nnot identified sociologically, but is instead understood as a certain\nsort of theory considered in the abstract. But then further problems\narise. First, it is now difficult to see the difference between\nholding the relevant attitude and simply believing a thesis. If one\nresolves to be guided in one\u2019s ontology by the truth of a\nparticular theory, how is that different from just believing the\ntheory? Second, if one holds an attitude toward a particular theory,\nHempel\u2019s dilemma seems to arise again though in a slightly\ndifferent form. For which physical theory is meant? If one means\ncurrent physics, as in fact Ney suggests, then one might argue that\nthis is not an attitude that physicalists should reasonably hold,\nsince current physics is incomplete; and if one means ideal physics,\nit is hard to see what the content or nature of the attitude is.\n\nTo see that the attitude is not sufficient, imagine a situation in\nwhich physics postulates properties or objects which are like those\npostulated by traditional dualists; as Ney puts it imagine \u201cit\nis the year 3000 AD and physicists have been forced to introduce\nirreducible mental entities into their theory.\u201d (2008, p. 12).\nIn such a situation, a person might hold the attitude Ney describes,\nand yet intuitively not be a physicalist. \n\nIn response, Ney agrees that this is a possibility but points out,\nfirst, it would still be reasonable to criticize the people who hold\nthe attitude \u2013 for example, on the grounds that those who hold a\ndifferent attitude might have arrived at correct ontology more quickly\n\u2013 and, second, that it doesn\u2019t follow that the attitude\ndefinitive of physicalism is identical to the attitude definitive of\ndualism. (The ideas underlying this second point are (a) if one adopts\nthe attitudinal view about physicalism then one should in fairness\nadopt it about dualism as well; and (b) that from the fact that two\nattitudes coincide in a possible situation it does not follow that\nthey are identical.) However, while both these suggestions might be\ntrue, it is hard to see them as responding to the basic point that\nperson who holds the attitude Ney describes in the imagined situation\nis not correctly described as a physicalist. In principle, after all,\nsuch a person may be criticized in many ways; moreover, the fact that\nholding a particular attitude is not sufficient for being a\nphysicalist does not entail that doing so is necessary for being a\ndualist.\n",
