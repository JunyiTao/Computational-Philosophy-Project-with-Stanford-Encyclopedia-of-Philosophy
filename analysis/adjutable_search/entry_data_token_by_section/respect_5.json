    "main_text": "Respect for Persons || Kant\u2019s Account of Respect for Persons\n2.2 Kant\u2019s Account of Respect for Persons\n\nThe most influential account of respect for persons is found in the\nmoral philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1785, 1788, 1793, 1797). Indeed,\nmost contemporary discussions of respect for persons explicitly claim\nto rely on, develop, or challenge some aspect of Kant\u2019s ethics.\nCentral to Kant\u2019s ethical theory is the claim that all persons,\nregardless of personal qualities or achievements, social position, or\nmoral track-record, are owed respect just because they are persons,\nthat is, beings with rational and autonomous wills. To be a person is\nto have a status and worth unlike that of any other kind of\nbeing: it is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the only\nappropriate response to such a being is respect. Moreover, respect for\npersons is not only appropriate but also unconditionally required:\npersons must always be respected. Because we are all too often\ninclined not to respect each other, one formulation of the Categorical\nImperative, which is the supreme principle of morality, commands that\nour actions express due respect for persons: \u201cAct in such a way\nthat you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of\nany other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an\nend\u201d (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\n(Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) (1785, 4:429).\nAlthough commentators disagree about how precisely to understand this\nimperative, one common view is that it defines our fundamental moral\nobligation as respect all persons, including ourselves, and thus\ndefines morally right actions as those that express respect for\npersons as ends in themselves and morally wrong actions as those that\nexpress disrespect or contempt for persons (Wood 1999). (On other\nreadings, respect is one of our fundamental duties, but there are\nothers, such as love, justice, and moral self-improvement.) In\naddition to this general commandment, Kant argues that there are also\nmore specific duties of respect for other persons and self-respect, to\nwhich we\u2019ll return. For now, we must address the question, What\nis it to be an end in itself and to possess dignity?\n\nAn end, for Kant, is anything for the sake of which we act. Kant\nidentifies two kinds of ends. The first are subjective ends, which are\nthings we want, which we pursue or promote through means we think will\nhelp us to get or advance them. The value of subjective ends is\nconditional on or relative to the desire or interests of the\nindividual who values them. The other kind of end is objective. These\nare ends in themselves, ends whose value is not dependent on any\ninterests or desires but is absolute and unconditional, grounded\nsolely in what they are. Kant maintains that all and only rational\nbeings are ends in themselves. The technical term\n\u201cpersons\u201d delineates the category of beings whose rational\nnature \u201calready marks them out as ends in themselves\u2026and\nan object of respect\u201d (Groundwork 4: 428).\n\nTo act for the sake of persons as ends in themselves, to respect them,\nis not to pursue or promote them, but to value them as the\nunconditionally valuable beings they are. It is also to acknowledge\nthat there are constraints on our treatment of persons, for to be an\nend in itself is also to be a limit--just as the end of the road puts\na limit on our travels, so an end in itself puts an absolute limit on\nthe subjective ends we may set, the means we may use to pursue them,\nand, very importantly, on how we may treat ends in themselves. Such\nbeings must never be used as if they were merely means, as if they\nwere nothing more than tools that we may use however we want to\nadvance our ends. Note, however, that it is not wrong to treat persons\nas means to our ends; indeed, we could not get along in life if we\ncould not make use of the talents, abilities, service, and labor of\nother people. What we must never do is treat persons as mere\nmeans to our ends, to treat them as if the only value they have is\nwhat derives from their usefulness to us. Rather, we must always treat\nthem \u201cas the same time as an end.\u201d\n\nKant holds that persons, as ends in themselves, have dignity (Die\nMetaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of Morals)\n(1797), 6: 435). But what is dignity? Until the last century or so,\n\u201cdignity\u201d (from the Latin dignitas, worthiness)\nreferred to a high social status associated with the aristocracy,\noffices of power, and high church positions. Dignity thus\ndistinguished socially important people from the hoi polloi,\nwho had no dignity (Debes 2017). Kant\u2019s view that every person\nhas dignity thus marks a revolution in valuation (but see Dean 2014\nand Hay 2012 for the view that only morally good people have dignity).\nCommentators disagree about how to understand what Kant means by\ndignity (cf. Sensen 2017, 2011; Cureton 2013; Darwall 2008). But the\nmost common interpretation is that dignity is a distinctive kind\nobjective worth that is absolute (not conditional on anyone\u2019s needs,\ndesires, or interests, and a value that everyone has an overriding\nreason to acknowledge); intrinsic or inherent (not bestowed or\nearned and not subject to being lost or forfeited); incomparable and\nthe highest form of worth (a being with dignity cannot rationally be\nexchanged for or replaced by any other valued object, and is\ninfinitely valuable, we might say, rather than worth $5 or $5\nmillion).\n\nIn arguing for respect for the dignity of persons, Kant explicitly\nrejects two other conceptions of human value: the aristocratic idea of\nhonor that individuals differentially deserve according to their\nsocial rank, individual accomplishments, or moral virtue (on the\naristocratic dimensions of honor, see Darwall 2013; Berger 1983), and\nthe view, baldly expressed by Hobbes, that:\n\n\u2026 the value or worth of a man is, as of all other things, his\nprice\u2014that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of\nhis power\u2014and therefore is not absolute but a thing dependent on\nthe need and judgment of another. (Hobbes 1651, 79)\n\n\nIn The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant agrees with Hobbes that if\nwe think of humans as merely one kind of animal among others \u201cin\nthe system of nature,\u201d we can ascribe a price to them, an\nextrinsic value that depends on their usefulness. But, he argues,\n\na human being regarded as a person, that is, as the subject of morally\npractical reason, is exalted above all price\u2026as an end in\nhimself he possesses a dignity by which he exacts\nrespect for himself from all other beings in the world.\n(MM, 6: 434\u2013435)\n\n\nAgainst the aristocratic view Kant argues that although individuals as\nmembers of some social community or other may have or lack meritorious\naccomplishment or status or may deserve honor or evaluative respect to\ndifferent degrees or not at all, and some people deserve social\nrecognition respect based on their socially significant features or\npositions, all persons as members of the moral community, i.e., the\ncommunity of all and only ends in themselves, are owed the same moral\nrecognition respect, for the dignity that they possesses as rational\nis unconditional and independent of all distinguishing facts about or\nfeatures of them.\n\nAs the Categorical Imperative indicates, in virtue of the humanity in\nthem that persons are, and so ought to be treated as, ends in\nthemselves. Commentators generally identify humanity (that which makes\nus distinctively human beings and sets us apart from all other animal\nspecies) with two closely related aspects of rationality: the capacity\nto set ends and the capacity to be autonomous, both of which are\ncapacities to be a moral agent (for example, Wood 1999; Hill 1997;\nKorsgaard 1996). The capacity to set ends, which is the power of\nrational choice, is the capacity to value things through rational\njudgment: to determine, under the influence of reason independently of\nantecedent instincts or desires, that something is valuable or\nimportant, that it is worth seeking or valuing. It is also, thereby,\nthe capacity to value ends in themselves, and so it includes the\ncapacity for respect (Velleman 1999). The capacity to be autonomous is\nthe capacity to be self-legislating and self-governing, that is, (a)\nthe capacity to legislate moral laws that are valid for all rational\nbeings through one\u2019s rational willing by recognizing, using\nreason alone, what counts as a moral obligation, and (b) the capacity\nthen to freely resolve to act in accordance with moral laws because\nthey are self-imposed by one\u2019s own reason and not because one is\ncompelled to act by any forces external to one\u2019s reason and\nwill, including one\u2019s own desires and inclinations. The capacity\nto be autonomous is thus also the capacity to freely direct, shape,\nand determine the meaning of one\u2019s own life, and it is the\ncondition for moral responsibility. It is then, not as members of the\nbiological species homo sapiens that human beings have\ndignity and so are owed moral recognition respect, but as rational\nbeings who are capable of moral agency.\n\nThere are several important consequences of the Kantian view of the\nscope of moral recognition respect for persons as persons. First,\nwhile all normally functioning human beings possess the rational\ncapacities that ground recognition respect, there can be humans in\nwhom these capacities are altogether absent and who therefore, on this\nview, are not persons and are not owed respect. Second, these\ncapacities could, in principle, be possessed by beings who are not\nbiologically human, and such beings would also be persons with dignity\nwhom we are morally obligated to respect. Third, because dignity does\nnot depend on how well or badly the capacities for moral agency are\nexercised, on whether a person acts morally or has a morally good\ncharacter or not, dignity is not a matter of degree and cannot be\ndiminished or lost through vice or morally bad action or increased\nthrough virtue or morally correct action. Thus, the morally\nworst person has the same dignity as the morally best, although the\nformer, we might say, fail to live up to their dignity. Likewise,\nmoral recognition respect is not something individuals have to earn or\nmight fail to earn, so even the morally worst individuals must still\nbe regarded as ends in themselves and treated with respect. Of course,\nwrongdoing may call for punishment and may be grounds for forfeiting\ncertain rights, but it is not grounds for losing dignity, for being\nregarded as worthless scum, or denied all respect (Hill 2000b). What\ngrounds dignity is something that all persons have in common, not\nsomething that distinguishes one individual from another. Thus, each\nperson is to be respected as an equal among equals, without\nconsideration of individual achievements or failures, social rank,\nmoral merit or demerit. However, the equality of all rational beings\ndoes not entail that persons cannot also be differentially evaluated\nand valued in other ways for their particular qualities,\naccomplishments, merit, or usefulness, although such valuing and\ntreatment must always be constrained by the moral requirement to\naccord recognition respect to persons as ends in themselves.\n\nIn The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant develops the implications\nof this view of persons as ends in themselves. His doctrine of justice\nholds that the fundamental freedom and equality of persons is the\nbasis of the legitimate state, that freedom of choice must be\nrespected and promoted, that persons are bearers of fundamental rights\nand that the moral status of persons imposes limits on permissible\nlegal punishment. In his doctrine of virtue, Kant discusses specific\nmoral duties of recognition respect for other persons, as well as\nduties of recognition self-respect, to which we\u2019ll return below.\nHere, Kant explicitly invokes the notion of respect as\nobservantia. We have no moral duty to feel respect for\nothers; rather, the respect we owe others is \u201cto be understood\nas the maxim of limiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in\nanother person, and so as respect in the practical sense\u201d\n(MM, 6:449). This duty of recognition respect owed to others\nrequires two things: first, that we adopt as a regulating policy a\ncommitment to control our own desire to think well of ourselves (this\ndesire being the main cause of disrespect), and, second, that we\nrefrain from treating others in the following ways: treating them\nmerely as means (valuing them as less than ends in themselves),\nshowing contempt for them (denying that they have any worth), treating\nthem arrogantly (demanding that they value us more highly than they\nvalue themselves), making them look like worthless beings by defaming\nthem by publicly exposing their faults, and ridiculing or mocking\nthem.\n\nSubsequent work in a Kantian vein on the duty of respect for others\nhas expanded the list of ways that we are morally required by respect\nto treat persons. In particular, although Kant says that the duties of\nrecognition respect are strictly negative, consisting in not engaging\nin certain conduct or having certain attitudes, many philosophers have\nargued that respecting others involves positive actions and attitudes\nas well. The importance of autonomy and agency in Kant\u2019s moral\nphilosophy has led many philosophers to highlight respect for\nautonomy. Thus, we respect others as persons (negatively) by doing\nnothing to impair or destroy their capacity for autonomy, by not\ninterfering with their autonomous decisions and their pursuit of the\n(morally acceptable) ends they value, and by not coercing or deceiving\nthem or treating them paternalistically. We also respect them\n(positively) by protecting them from threats to their autonomy (which\nmay require intervention when someone\u2019s current decisions seem\nto put their autonomy at risk) and by promoting autonomy and the\nconditions for it (for example, by allowing and encouraging\nindividuals to make their own decisions, take responsibility for their\nactions, and control their own lives). Some philosophers have\nhighlighted Kant\u2019s claim that rationality is the ground for\nrecognition respect, arguing that to respect others is to engage with\nthem not as instruments or obstacles but as persons who are to be\nreasoned with. The importance of the capacity to set ends and value\nthings has been taken by some philosophers to entail that respect also\ninvolves helping others to promote and protect what they value and to\npursue their ends, provided these are compatible with due respect for\nother persons, and making an effort to appreciate values that are\ndifferent from our own. Kant\u2019s emphasis in the doctrine of\njustice on the fundamental rights that persons have has led still\nothers to view the duty of recognition respect for persons as the duty\nto respect the moral rights they have as persons; some have claimed\nthat the duty to respect is nothing more than the duty to refrain from\nviolating these rights (Benn 1988; Feinberg 1970).\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that on Kant\u2019s account, both the moral law\nand morally good people--those who do what is right out of respect for\nthe moral law--are also objects of respect. The respect here is\nreverentia, the inescapable felt consciousness of the\nunconditional authority of the law and compelling examples of\nobedience to it, a consciousness of one\u2019s mind \u201cbowing,\u201d as it were,\nin submission. Reverentia can give rise both to recognition\nrespect of the law and persons as such and to evaluative respect for\ngood people.
