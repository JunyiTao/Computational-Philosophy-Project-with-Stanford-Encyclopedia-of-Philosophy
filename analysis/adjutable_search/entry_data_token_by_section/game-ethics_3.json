    "main_text": "Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality || The Inseparable Goods Strategy\n3.1 The Inseparable Goods Strategy\n\nThe inseparable goods strategy appeals to certain benefits\none can gain or preserve only by acting morally, that the Foole\napparently fails to consider. Plato\u2019s account of the benefits of\njustice in the Gorgias and Republic is one example\nof this approach. Plato maintains that if one commits an injustice,\nthen one\u2019s soul will consequently be corrupted, and he further\nmaintains that to have a corrupt soul is the worst of all possible\nmisfortunes (Gorgias 478c3\u2013478e5, Republic\n353d3\u2013354a7). Alternatively, one might follow Aquinas in arguing\nthat an injustice like stealing is a mortal sin which will bring about\nterrible consequences in the afterlife (Aquinas 1271: II.II Q. 66 A.\n6). Or Sidgwick, who emphasizes the internal sanctions of\nduty one is likely to suffer on account of their immoral conduct\n(Sidgwick 1874 [2011: 164]). Viewed through the lens of game theory,\nthe inseparable goods approach recommends that those who doubt the\nprudential rationality of acting morally should reevaluate their\npreferences in light of the totality of goods at stake. For example,\n Figure 4\n below illustrates how the scenario depicted in\n Figure 3\n would change if Laura becomes persuaded that she would suffer a cost\n\\(\\gamma > 1\\) as a result of breaking her covenant with Claudia,\nperhaps owing to the guilt she might feel for committing an\ninjustice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Sequential Exchange Game with\nRevised Payoffs, [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis extensive form game depicts Laura\u2019s true payoffs, including\nthe cost of guilt that Sidgwick would call an internal sanction. In\nthis game if Claudia performs as promised, then to follow P\nas justice requires is now Laura\u2019s best response. However, this\nisn\u2019t because we\u2019ve simply assumed that one couldn\u2019t\never stand to gain by breaking a promise. To see why, note that if\nClaudia breaks her promise first, then A continues to be\nLaura\u2019s best response. As we saw in our discussion of the\nevolution of cooperation, morality can\u2019t require us to be\nsuckers. Or, to use Kavka\u2019s helpful terminology, justice may\nforbid violating a covenant offensively by breaking\none\u2019s promise unexpectedly, while permitting defensive\nviolations of covenants that others can no longer reasonably expect us\nto honor (Kavka 1986: 139). Accordingly, if Claudia offensively\nviolates her covenant with Laura by following A, then if\nLaura responds in kind, Laura\u2019s violation should not give rise\nto the internal sanctions associated with having committed an\ninjustice. Furthermore, note that the presence of internal sanctions\ncan change things even when these aren\u2019t universally felt. For\ninstance, even if Claudia herself would feel negligible guilt for\noffensively violating their covenant, if Claudia knows that Laura\nwould suffer the internal sanction cost \\(\\gamma > 1\\) of offensive\nviolation, then Claudia can expect Laura to perform when she does as\nwell, and in this case she fares best by following P at the\noutset.\n",
