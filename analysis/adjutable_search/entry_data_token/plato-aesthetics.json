Art, mostly as represented by poetry,\nis closer to a greatest danger than any other phenomenon Plato speaks\nof, while beauty is close to a greatest good. Can there be such a\nthing as \u201cPlato\u2019s aesthetics\u201d that contains both\npositions?\n\nTo the literal-minded the very phrase \u201cPlato\u2019s\naesthetics\u201d refers to an anachronism, given that this area of\nphilosophy only came to be identified in the last few centuries. But\neven those who take aesthetics more broadly and permit the term find\nsomething exploratory in Plato\u2019s treatments of art and\nbeauty. He might be best described as seeking to discover the\nvocabulary and issues of aesthetics. For this reason Plato\u2019s\nreaders will not come upon a single aesthetic theory in the\ndialogues. For the same reason they are uniquely situated to watch\ncore concepts of aesthetics being defined: beauty, imitation,\ninspiration.\n\nThere is something more, something important about Plato, to be said\nabout the label \u201caesthetics.\u201d One normally speaks of\naesthetics or a philosophy of art when the theory covers more than a\nsingle art form. For understandable reasons the Platonic dialogues\nfocus on poetry, and with special energy on dramatic poetry. Tragedy\nand comedy were culturally dominant art forms during Socrates\u2019\nlifetime and much of Plato\u2019s. Innovative, memorable, and now long\nenduring, Athenian drama invited scrutiny. But tellingly, when the\ndialogues comment on poetry they also look at it in tandem with the\nvisual arts \u2013 not capriciously either, but in keeping with an\nancient Greek tradition of comparing art forms \u2013 and in this\nmovement toward an overarching theory they deserve to be described as\npracticing the philosophy of art.\n\nJames Porter has recently argued that analogizing between art forms\ncharacterized a whole culture of sensualist aesthetic thinking before\nPlato and hence the early appearance of a general idea\n\u201cart.\u201d Poetry commented on architecture, drama on rhetoric\n(Porter 2010, 188). We may add that in another fashion tragedy\ncompared itself to sculpture (Pappas 2012b, 325). Some of these\ninterpretations of aesthetic analysis are controversial; but there is\nno doubt that the Homeric \u201cshield of Achilles\u201d passage\n(Iliad 18.479\u2013609) implies a parallel between the\nshield\u2019s presentation of war and peace and the treatment of those same\nsubjects in Homer. What Hephaestus depicts on the shield, Homer\ndepicts in his epics (Cunningham 2007, Francis 2009).\n\nThe poet Simonides makes the analogy explicit. \u201cPainting is\nsilent poetry and poetry is painting that speaks\u201d (Plutarch\nThe Glory of the Athenians 3.1, 346f-347a). Although poetry\ncasts itself as the standard that painting fails to achieve,\npossessing as it does the voice that painting lacks, still some common\nelement unites the different forms.\n\nPlato\u2019s explication of poetic mim\u00easis by means of the\nmim\u00easis in painting (see below on Republic Book\n10) belongs in this analogizing tradition, as Aristotle\u2019s account of\nmim\u00easis will after him (Poetics Chapter 4\n1448b4\u201319; Halliwell 2002, 178). On both theories, painting and\npoetry belong together as fellow species within a larger artistic\ngenus.\n\nAt the same time, Plato appears to consider painting on its own terms,\nnot merely as illustrative of a process also found in poetry. Many\npassages speak in approving terms of painting and sculpture, or\nrecognize the skill involved in making them as a techn\u00ea\n\u201cprofession, craft\u201d (Ion 532e-533a; Gorgias\n430c, 448b, 453c-d, 503e; Protagoras 318b-c; see Demand 1975,\nHalliwell 2002, 37\u201343). Even the famously anti-poetic Republic\ncontains positive references to paintings and drawings. Sometimes\nthese are metaphors for acts of imagination and political reform\n(472d, 500e-501c), sometimes literal images whose attractiveness helps\nto form a young ruler\u2019s character (400d-401a) \u2013 in any case\nvisual arts appreciated on their own terms and for their own sake.\n\nWhen the Republic treats painting and poetry together, in other\nwords, it does so with a clear independent sense of visual depiction.\nIt aims at developing a philosophy of art.\n\nThe subject calls for care. If perennially footnoted by later\nphilosophers Plato has also been perennially thumbnailed.\nClich\u00e9s accompany his name. It is worth going slowly through\nthe main topics of Plato\u2019s aesthetics\u2014not in the search\nfor some surprising theory unlike anything that has been said, but so\nthat background shading and details may emerge, for a result that\nperhaps resembles the commonplaces about his thought as a human face\nresembles the cartoon reduction of it.\n\nIn what follows, citations to passages in Plato use \u201cStephanus\npages,\u201d based on a sixteenth-century edition of Plato\u2019s\nworks. The page numbers in that edition, together with the letters\na\u2013e, have become standard. Almost every translation of Plato\nincludes the Stephanus page numbers and letters in the margins, or at\nthe top of the page. Thus, \u201cSymposium 204b\u201d\nrefers to the same brief passage in every edition and every\ntranslation of Plato.\n", "toc": [{"#Bea": "1.

Beauty\n\nThe study of Plato on beauty must begin with one warning. The Greek\nadjective kalon only approximates to the English\n\u201cbeautiful.\u201d Not everything Plato says about a\nkalos, kal\u00ea, or kalon thing will\nbelong in a summary of his aesthetic theories. \n\nReaders can take this distinction between the Greek and English terms\ntoo far. It always feels more scrupulous to argue against equating\nwords from different languages than to treat them interchangeably. And\nthe discussion bears more on assessments of Platonic ethical theory\nthan on whatever subject may be called Plato\u2019s aesthetics.\n\nBut even given these qualifications the reader should know how to tell\nwhat is beautiful from what is kalon. To begin with the terms\nhave overlapping but distinct ranges of application. A passage in\nPlato may speak of a face or body that someone finds kalon,\nor for that matter a statue, a spoon, a tree, a grassy place to rest\n(Phaedrus 230b). Then \u201cbeautiful\u201d makes a natural\nequivalent, certainly less stilted than the alternatives. And yet even\nhere it is telling that Plato far more often uses kalon for a\nface or body than for works of art and natural scenery. As far as\nunambiguous beauties are concerned, he has a smaller set in mind than\nwe do (Kosman 2010).\n\nMore typically kalon appears in contexts to which\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d would fit awkwardly if at all. For both Plato\nand Aristotle\u2014and in many respects for Greek popular\nmorality\u2014kalon has a particular role to play as ethical\napprobation, not by meaning the same thing that agathon\n\u201cgood\u201d means, but as a special complement to goodness. At\ntimes kalon narrowly means \u201cnoble,\u201d often and\nmore loosely \u201cadmirable.\u201d The compound kalos\nk\u2019agathos, the aristocratic ideal, is all-round praise, not\n\u201cbeautiful and good\u201d as its components would translate\nseparately, but closer to \u201csplendid and upright.\u201d Here\nkalon is entirely an ethical term. Calling virtue beautiful\nfeels misplaced in modern terms, or even perverse; calling wisdom\nbeautiful, as the Symposium does (204b), will sound like a\nmistake (Kosman 2010, 348\u2013350).\n\nSome commentators try to keep kalon and\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d close to synonymous despite these differences\nin their semantic ranges (Hyland 2008). David Konstan has rejuvenated\nthe question by emphasizing the beauty not in uses of the adjective\nkalon but in the related noun kallos (Konstan 2014,\nKonstan 2015). As welcome as this shift of focus is regarding Greek\nwriting as a whole, it runs into difficulties when we read Plato; for\nkallos carries overtones of physical, visual attractiveness,\nand Plato is cautious about the desire that such attractiveness\narouses.\n\nRather than seek a Greek equivalent for \u201cbeautiful,\u201d\ntranslators often choose another English word for kalon. One\nrightly popular choice is \u201cfine,\u201d which applies to most\nthings labeled kalon and is also appropriate to ethical and\naesthetic contexts (so Woodruff 1983). There are fine suits and string\nquartets but also fine displays of courage. Of course modern\nEnglish-speakers have fine sunsets and fine dining as well, this word\nbeing even broader than kalon. That is not to mention fine\npoints or fine print. And whereas people frequently ask what beauty\nreally consists in, so that a conversation on the topic might actually\nhave taken place, it is hard to imagine worrying over \u201cwhat the\nfine is\u201d or \u201cwhat is really fine.\u201d\n\nThe telling criterion will be not philological but philosophical.\nStudying the Hippias Major each reader should ask whether\nPlato\u2019s treatment of to kalon sounds relevant to questions\none asks about beauty today.\n1.1 Hippias Major\n\nFor a long time scholars treated the Hippias Major as a\nspurious dialogue. Today most agree that Plato wrote it, and its\nsustained inquiry into beauty is seen as central to Platonic\naesthetics.\n\nThe Hippias Major follows Socrates and the Sophist Hippias\nthrough a sequence of attempts to define to kalon. Socrates\nbadgers Hippias, in classic Socratic ways, to identify beauty\u2019s\ngeneral nature; Hippias offers three definitions. Quite preposterously\nfor instance \u201ca beautiful young woman is beautiful\u201d\n(287e). Hippias had a reputation for the breadth of his factual\nknowledge. He compiled the first list of Olympic victors, and he might\nhave written the first history of philosophy. But his over-ingestion\nof specifics has evidently left him unable to digest his experience\nand generalize to a philosophical definition.\n\nAfter Hippias fails, Socrates tries three definitions. These are\ngeneral but they fail too, and\u2014again in classic Socratic\nmode\u2014the dialogue ends unresolved. In one excursus Socrates says\nbeauty \u201cis appropriate [prepei]\u201d and proposes\ndefining it as \u201cwhat is appropriate [to prepon]\u201d\n(290d). Although ending in refutation this discussion (to 294e) is\nworth a look as the anticipation of a modern debate. Philosophers of\nthe eighteenth century argue over whether an object is beautiful by\nsatisfying the definition of the object, or independently of that\ndefinition (Guyer 1993). Kant calls the beauty that is appropriateness\n\u201cdependent beauty\u201d (Critique of Judgment, section\n16). Such beauty threatens to become a species of the good. Within the\naccepted corpus of genuine Platonic works beauty is never subsumed\nwithin the good, the appropriate, or the beneficial; Plato seems to\nbelong in the same camp as Kant in this respect. (On Platonic beauty\nand the good see Barney 2010.) Nevertheless, and of course, he is no\nsimple sensualist about beauty either. The very temptation in Plato to\nlink the beautiful with the good and to assess it intellectually is\npart of why Porter calls him and Aristotle \u201cformalists,\u201d\nwho diverted ancient theorizing about art from its sensualist origins\n(Porter 2010).\n\nDespite its inconclusiveness the Hippias Major reflects the\nview of beauty found in other dialogues:\n\nBeauty behaves as canonical Platonic Forms do. It possesses the\nreality that Forms have and is discovered through the same dialectic\nthat brings other Forms to light. Socrates wants Hippias to explain\nthe property that is known when any examples of beauty are known\n(essence of beauty), the cause of all occurrences of\nbeauty, and more precisely the cause not of the appearance of beauty\nbut of its real being (286d, 287c, 289d, 292c, 294e,\n297b).\nNevertheless beauty is not just any Form. It bears some close\nrelationship to the good (296d), even though Socrates argues that the\ntwo are distinct (296e ff., 303e ff.). It is therefore a Form of some\nstatus above that of other Forms.\nSocrates and Hippias appeal to artworks as examples of beautiful\nthings but do not treat those as central cases (290a\u2013b,\n297e\u2013298a). So too generally Plato conducts his inquiry into\nbeauty at a distance from his discussion of art. (But the\nRepublic and the Laws both contain exceptions to\nthis generalization: Lear 2010, 361.) \n\n\nThese three aspects of Platonic beauty work together and reflect\nbeauty\u2019s unique place in Plato\u2019s metaphysics, something almost both\nvisible and intelligible.\n1.2 Beauty and art\n\nThe three features of beauty in the Hippias Major also apply\nin the Symposium, Plato\u2019s other major analysis of beauty. In\nthe Symposium Socrates claims to be quoting his teacher\nDiotima on the subject of love, and in the lesson attributed to her\nshe calls beauty the object of every love\u2019s yearning. She spells out\nthe soul\u2019s progress toward ever-purer beauty, from one body to all,\nthen through all beautiful souls to laws and kinds of knowledge,\nfinally reaching beauty itself (210a\u2013211d).\n\nDiotima describes the poet\u2019s task as the begetting of wisdom and other\nvirtues (209a). Ultimately desiring what is beautiful the poet\nproduces works of verse. And who would not envy Homer or Hesiod\n(209d)? But aside from these passages the Symposium seems\nprepared to treat anything but a poem as an exemplar of\nbeauty. In a similar spirit the Philebus\u2019s examples of pure\nsensory beauty exclude pictures (51b\u2013d).\n\nThe Republic contains tokens of Plato\u2019s reluctance to\nassociate poetry with beauty. The dialogue\u2019s first discussion of\npoetry, whose context is education, censors poems that corrupt the\nyoung (377b\u2013398b). Then almost immediately Socrates speaks of\ncultivating a fondness for beauty among the young guardians. Let them\nsee gracefulness (eusch\u00eamosun\u00ea) in paintings and\nillustrative weaving, a sibling to virtue (401a). Their taste for\nbeauty will help them prefer noble deeds over ugly vulgar ones\n(401b\u2013d, 403c). How can Plato have seen the value of beauty to\neducation and not mentioned the subject in his earlier criticisms? Why\ncouldn\u2019t this part of the Republic concede that false and\npernicious poems affect the young through their beauty?\n\nBut the Republic takes pains to deny that beauty appears in\npoetry. Republic 10 calls the beauty of poetic lines\ndeceptive. Take away the decorative language that makes a poetic\nsentiment sound right and put it into ordinary words, and it becomes\nunremarkable, as young people\u2019s faces beautified by youth later show\nthemselves as the plain looks they are (601b).\n1.3 The Form of beauty\n\nThe fundamental datum in understanding Platonic beauty as part of\nPlato\u2019s aesthetics is that Plato sees no opposition between the\npleasures that beauty brings and the goals of philosophy. Plato\nmentions no other Form in the Symposium; the Form of beauty\nis Form enough. Philosophers meet this beauty in an experience in\nwhich they consummate their deepest love while also attaining the\nloftiest knowledge. \n\nMany passages in Plato associate a Form with beauty: Cratylus\n439c; Euthydemus 301a; Laws 655c; Phaedo\n65d, 75d, 100b; Phaedrus 254b; Parmenides 130b;\nPhilebus 15a; Republic 476b, 493e, 507b. Plato\nmentions beauty as often as he speaks of any property that admits of\nphilosophical conceptualization, and for which a Form therefore\nexists. Thanks to the features of Forms as such, we know that this\nentity being referred to must be something properly called beauty,\nwhose nature can be articulated without recourse to the natures of\nparticular beautiful things. (See especially Phaedo 79a and\nPhaedrus 247c on properties of this Form.)\n\nBeauty is Plato\u2019s example of a Form so frequently for a pair of\nreasons. On one hand it bears every mark of the Forms. It is an\nevaluative concept as much as justice and courage are, and suffers\nfrom disputes over its meaning as much as they do. The Theory of Forms\nseeks to guarantee stable referents for disputed evaluative terms; so\nif anything needs a Form, beauty does, and it will have a Form if any\nproperty does.\n\nIn general, a Form F differs from an individual F\nthing in that F may be predicated univocally of the Form: The\nForm F is F. An individual F thing\nboth is and is not F. In this sense the same property\nF can only be predicated equivocally of the individual (e.g.\nRepublic 479a\u2013c). Plato\u2019s analysis of equivocally\nF individuals (Cratylus 439d\u2013e,\nSymposium 211a) recalls observations that everyone makes\nabout beautiful objects. They fade with time; require an offsetting\nugly detail; elicit disagreements among observers; lose their beauty\noutside their context (adult shoes on children\u2019s feet). Here beauty\ndoes better than most other properties at meeting the criteria for\nForms and non-Forms. Odd numbers may fail to be odd in some\nhard-to-explain way, but the ways in which beautiful things fall short\nof their perfection are obvious even to the unphilosophical.\n\nBut physical beauty is atypical being a Form that humans want\nto know. This is the second reason Plato makes beauty such a frequent\nexample of a Form. The process known as anamn\u00easis or\nrecollection is more plausible for beauty than it is for most other\nproperties. The philosophical merit of equivocally F things\nis that they come bearing signs of their incompleteness, so that the\ninquisitive mind wants to know more (Republic\n523c\u2013524d). But not everyone can read those signs of\nincompleteness. Soft or large items inspire questions in minds of an\nabstract bent. The perception of examples of justice or self-control\npresupposes moral development before someone can recognize a law\u2019s\ndouble nature as just and unjust. By contrast, beautiful things strike\neveryone, and arouse everyone\u2019s curiosity. Therefore, beauty promises\nmore effective reflection than any other property of things. Beauty\nalone is both a Form and a sensory experience (Phaedrus\n250d).\n\nSo the Phaedrus (250d\u2013256b) and Symposium\nignore people\u2019s experiences of other properties when they describe the\nfirst movement into philosophizing. Beautiful things remind souls of\ntheir mystery as no other visible objects do, and in his optimistic\nmoments Plato welcomes people\u2019s attention to them.\n\nThose optimistic moments are not easy to sustain. To make beauty\neffective for learning Plato needs to rely on its desirability (as\nforegrounded in Konstan 2015) while also counting on the soul\u2019s\nability to transfer its desiring from the visible to the intelligible\n(see Philebus 65e). Plato is ambivalent about visual\nexperience. Sight may be metaphorically like knowledge, but\nmetonymically it calls to mind the ignorant senses (Pappas 2015,\n49).\n\nBeauty\u2019s unmatched pedagogical effects, when the transfer of desire\nsucceeds, show why Plato talks about its goodness and good\nconsequences, sometimes even its identity with \u201cthe good\u201d\n(Laws 841c; Philebus 66a\u2013b; Republic\n401c; Symposium 201c, 205e; but the relationship between\nbeautiful and good, especially in Symposium, is\ncontroversial: White 1989). These desirable effects also explain why\nPlato speaks grudgingly of beauty in art and poetry. Another question\nmatters more than either poetry or beauty does: What leads a mind\ntoward knowledge and the Forms? Things of beauty do so excellently\nwell. Poems mostly don\u2019t. When poems (or paintings) set the mind\nrunning along unphilosophical tracks away from what is abstract and\nintelligible, the attractions they possess will be seen as\nmeretricious. The corrupting cognitive effect exercised by poems\ndemonstrates their inability to function as Plato knows the beautiful\nobject to function.\n\nThe corrupting effect needs to be spelled out. What prevents poems\nfrom behaving as beautiful objects do? The answer will have to address\nthe orienting question in Plato\u2019s aesthetics, namely: What fosters\nphilosophical enlightenment, and what obstructs it?\n2. Imitation\n\n\u201cImitation\u201d is the commonest English translation of\nmim\u00easis. Alternatives include\n\u201crepresentation\u201d and \u201cemulation.\u201d To make\nthings confusing, the transliterated Greek word sans diacritical mark\nhas come to be accepted as English (\u201cmimesis\u201d). All the\ntranslations capture something of the word\u2019s meaning. As long as\n\u201cimitation\u201d is used with awareness that it will not mean\neverything that mim\u00easis does, it makes a serviceable\ntranslation. \u201cImitate\u201d functions well enough as the verb\nmimeisthai; so does \u201cmimic.\u201d (See S\u00f6rbom\n1966; also see Maru\u0161i\u010d 2011.)\n\nOf course one can use the Greek mim\u00easis, as this\ndiscussion will frequently do. For simplicity\u2019s sake some prefer the\nnow-English \u201cmimesis.\u201d But this last choice brings a risk.\nThe English word \u201cmimesis\u201d has begun picking up its own\ncontexts and connotations, becoming English proportionately as it\nceases to substitute for the Greek word.\n\nBesides mim\u00easis Plato sometimes speaks of a\nmim\u00eama. \u201cImitation\u201d like\nmim\u00easis can refer either to a process or to its\noutcome. You engage in the act of imitation in order to produce an\nimitation. A mim\u00eama however is only ever a copy, not\nalso the copying act that produced it.\n\n(Mateo Duque was of much help in thinking through issues in the coming\nsections.)\n2.1 Mim\u00easis in Aristophanes\n\nAuthors before Plato used mim\u00easis more vaguely than he\ndid, neither specially applying the word to a poetic process nor\nnecessarily implying its fraudulence \u2014with one important\nexception. The comedies of Aristophanes, obsessed with Euripides and\nwith tragedy in general (Birds 787, 1444; Clouds\n1091; Plutus 423\u20134), introduce comments about tragic\nstagecraft that say mimeisthai and mim\u00easis in\nconsistently pejorative ways.\n\nAlthough comedy is sometimes identified as antagonist to philosophy in\nthe \u201cancient quarrel\u201d Plato speaks of between philosophy\nand poetry (Most 2011), Aristophanes has also long been seen as\nPlato\u2019s precursor in the moralistic critique of poetry. They share\nconservative sensibilities that outweigh Aristophanes\u2019 slander of\nSocrates in Clouds (Nussbaum 1980). But Aristophanes\u2019\ninfluence on Plato extends, as commentators do not always recognize,\nto the nature of mim\u00easis. He uses that word in a\ntechnical sense that describes what actors do in a play, and with\nsuggestions of fraud or concealment.\n\nIn addition to Frogs with its face-off between Aeschylus and\nEuripides there is Women Celebrating the Thesmophoria, which\ncalls mim\u00easis a disruption of life and opposes it to\nnature. It can also be argued that Women Celebrating the\nThesmophoria finds an ambiguity in dramatic imitation that\nanticipates Plato; for in that play, as in the Republic,\nmim\u00easis combines composition and performance, the\ninvention of characters and the portrayal of them (Pappas 1999).\n2.2 Republic 3: impersonation\n\nPlato cites mim\u00easis as a characteristic of poetry alone\nin Republic Book 3 and Laws Book 4.\n\nBooks 2 and 3 of the Republic assess poetry\u2019s role in the\ncurriculum for the city\u2019s guardian class. The first part of this\npassage, mainly in Book 2, condemns the images of gods and demigods\nthat Homer and the tragedians have produced, both blaspheming and\nsetting bad examples to the young (377e\u2013392c). After this\ncriticism of content Socrates turns to what he labels the \u201cstyle\n[lexis]\u201d of narration. Poetic narration can take place\nthrough narration alone, through mim\u00easis alone, or with\na mix of the two (392d).\n\nAlready this way of differentiating storytelling styles is irregular,\nas if one analyzed walking into pure walking, running, and a\ncombination of the two, as a method for understanding\nrunning. Such an analysis would mark the act of running as\nfailed or deviant walking. Likewise the taxonomy of narrations\npresumes that mim\u00easis is deviant.\n\nThe subsequent pages continue treating mim\u00easis as\nanomalous, or rather as comprehensible only under the sign of anomaly\nand failure. Socrates defines imitation, develops two arguments\nagainst it, and finally proclaims that no mimetic poetry will be\nadmitted into the city that the Republic is founding.\n\nThe defining example establishes mim\u00easis as\nimpersonation. Homer\u2019s poems alternate between third-person accounts\nof events (in which Homer narrates in his own voice) and speeches of\nthe characters involved in those events. When Homer relates\nAgamemnon\u2019s rebuke to the priest Chryses he uses the abusive language\nthat a warriors\u2019 king would use when such a king refused to show mercy\n(393a\u2013c). The presentation of character is, notably, ambiguous\nbetween the act of writing or composing the words of a\ncharacter like Agamemnon, and the act of reciting\n(performing, acting out) the words. The ambiguity (seen also in\nAristophanes) lets Socrates deploy more than one argument against the\npresentation of characters.\n\nThe main argument is blunt but clear, and plausible enough. What the\nnew city really does not want is the presentation of base types,\nbecause acting such parts fosters the behaviors that are found in the\npersons being mimicked (395c\u2013397e). Attempts to read this\nimpersonation as attention to appearance alone (Lear 2011) have the\nadvantage of unifying Book 3 with Book 10, but sacrifice the\npsychological simplicity behind the argument.\n\nIf acting a part does lead to taking on the characteristics of the\npart, then in one respect Plato has a powerful point and in another\nrespect is generating a misleading argument. The point is powerful\ninasmuch as it lets Plato ban all portrayals of vicious and ignoble\ncharacters but not the portrayals of brave soldiers, philosophers, and\nother wholesome types. Moreover the factual premise is believable.\nTaking on someone else\u2019s traits and tics can have a more lasting\neffect than the Republic\u2019s critics sometimes acknowledge.\nActors even today comment on how a role changed them.\n\nEven this most plausible part of the argument runs into trouble.\nPlato\u2019s list of things unworthy of imitation proves surprisingly\ncommodious. Alongside villains one finds women, slaves, animals,\nmusical instruments, gears and pulleys, and sounds of water. And these\nlast examples beg the question. Sounding like machinery does not make\nthe imitator more like a gear or pulley; it must be a deranged\npractice only insofar as all impersonation is deranged. And that is\nwhat the argument was aiming to prove.\n\nBut the significantly misleading nature of the argument goes beyond a\nmoment of overstatement. The case against mim\u00easis\nmisleads in that it exploits the ambiguity between impersonation as\nsomething a writer does and impersonation as the performer\u2019s task. In\n1963 Eric Havelock stressed the importance of this ambiguity to Book\n3; but Havelock understated the degree to which Plato exploited the\nambiguity. The most convincing part of Book 3 has to assume that\nmim\u00easis is performance, both because such effects as\nthunder are mimicked in performance, not on the page; and because the\nbad effects of impersonation on character make more sense when\ndescribing young actors\u2019 playing a vicious role than grown playwrights\nin the act of writing that role.\n\nOn the other hand performance does not involve a whole population.\nMany young male Athenians did participate in choruses for comedy and\ntragedy. Each year a few dozen future farmers and doctors, generals\nand gentlemen, spent a season preparing for their time on stage. Even\nso, the extensiveness of the practice among young people does not\njustify barring all drama from the city and from the sight of each\ncitizen, and that is what Plato\u2019s concluding ban comes to:\n\nIf a man were to arrive in the city whose wisdom [sophia]\nempowered him to become everything and to mimic all\nthings\u2014together with the poems he wanted to perform\n[epideixasthai]\u2014 we would worship him as someone holy\n[hieron] and wonderful and pleasant, but tell him there is no\nman like him in our city, nor by our traditional law [themis]\ncan come to be here; and we would send him off to another city after\npouring myrrh on his head and crowning him with wool. (398a)\n\n\nThe religious language is lavish, and significant. No ordinary deeds\nare being excluded but ones that smell of sacred power. And Plato\u2019s\ncensorship will be complete. The city fathers running mimetic poetry\nout of town have broadened their scope from the young guardians\u2019\neducation to the cultural life of a community. The literary\nrepresentation of characters will receive no hearing anywhere. It is\neven doubtful whether the city will permit dramatic poems to circulate\nin written form. The poet has had to bring his writings with him, and\nhe cannot get his foot in the door.\n\nThe poet is a visitor because mimetic poetry has no natural home in\nthe philosophers\u2019 town. Moreover he arrives offering to recite his\npoems. That they are his makes him a poet, that he comes to\nrecite them makes him a performer. Thus he embodies the\nambiguity built into Book 3\u2019s definition of mim\u00easis. If\nthe fate of imitative composition stands or falls with the fate of\nimitative performance, a reasonable worry about behaviors that young\npeople experiment with balloons into an argument against a mammoth\nbody of literature. In short, the ambiguity in Plato\u2019s definition of\nimitation does not merely remind us (as Havelock argued) that he is\nwitnessing the transition from oral to written culture. It makes\nPlato\u2019s grand conclusion possible.\n\nImitation is a formal concept in Book 3. This is to say 1) that one\ncan distinguish poetic mim\u00easis from poetic narration by\nlooking for a formal element in the poetry; and 2) that\nmim\u00easis may make poetry more deleterious than it would\notherwise be, but does not work these bad effects by itself, only when\nthe characters represented are bad to begin with. The definition of\nimitation in Book 3 entails no general ideas of similarity or\nlikeness. Mim\u00easis functions as a technical term with a\nnarrowly literary meaning, no more inherently philosophical than is\nthe distinction one would draw in English today between direct and\nindirect discourse.\n\nBook 10 will look at imitation from a different perspective. Space\ndoes not permit a review of all existing proposals about how to square\nthe two passages. Whether Books 3 and 10 offer compatible\naccounts of mim\u00easis, and how one might make\nthem compatible, remains the most controversial question about Plato\u2019s\naesthetics. (See Belfiore 1984, Halliwell 1988, Nehamas 1982; and for\na superb summary of the main proposals, Naddaff 2002, 136n8. Lear 2011\nis a recent argument in favor of the two passages\u2019 agreement with one\nanother.) Still one may trust a few summative statements.\nRepublic 10 revises the formal aspects of\nmim\u00easis with a picturing or portrayal that involves\nmore than direct quotation. The enhanced concept cannot be understood\nwithout reference to the Republic\u2019s psychological theory. And\nin its expanded form the term refers to something bad in itself.\n2.3 Republic 10: copy-making\n\nAs the Sophist does, Book 10 of the Republic treats\nmim\u00easis as a property broader than drama. The topic in\nthis passage (595a\u2013608b) is a mim\u00easis common to\npainting and poetry and much like picturing or copying. It is a\nrelationship between a visible original and its visible likeness.\n\nAs Book 10 begins, Socrates links the coming treatment with what Book\n3 had said about imitation. He also establishes the difference between\nthe passages. What follows will defend Book 3\u2019s banishment of\n\u201cimitative poetry\u201d in terms that the Republic\ndeveloped after Book 3. \u201cNow that we have differentiated the\nsoul\u2019s eid\u00ea,\u201d the danger of imitation becomes\nmore evident (595a\u2013b). An eidos is a kind, and this\nphrase \u201ckinds of soul\u201d is most often taken to mean the\nparts of the soul that Book 4 distinguished (435b\u2013441c). The\nRepublic\u2019s theory of reason, spirit, and desire can enlarge\nwhat had been in Book 3 no more than suspicion about the impersonation\nof ignoble people. The new argument will charge poetry with upsetting\nthe balance among the soul\u2019s parts. (Daniel Mailick contributed to\nthis discussion of the Republic\u2019s psychological theory.)\n\nIn all Plato develops three theses during this first half of Book\n10:\n\nPoetic mim\u00easis, like the kind found in painting, is\nthe imitation of appearance alone, and its products rank far below\ntruth. (596e\u2013602c)\nTherefore poetic mim\u00easis corrupts the soul,\nweakening the rational impulse\u2019s control over the person\u2019s other\ndrives and desires. (602c\u2013608b)\nIt should therefore be banned from the good city.\n\n\nThe argument supporting (1) seeks to spell out how badly poetry and\npainting fare at grasping and communicating knowledge. Partly because\nthey do so badly, but also for other reasons, mimetic arts bring moral\nand psychological ill effects (2).\n\nThe words \u201cimitation of appearance\u201d in thesis (1) follow\nfrom Plato\u2019s three-way differentiation:\n\nForm (of couch, of table) made by a god.\nIndividual things (couches, tables) made by humans.\nPaintings (of couch or table) made by imitators.\n\n\nThe carpenter works with eyes aiming \u201ctoward\n[pros]\u201d the Form (596b)\u2014not with eyes on\nthe Form\u2014so the individual couch the carpenter makes is\nsomething less than the Form: an honest failing after a decent try. If\nthe Form is an object of knowledge, human creators at least possess\ntrue opinion (601e).\n\nThus category II is not a domain of imitation, and the table in a\npainting is not the \u201cimitation of an imitation.\u201d\nNevertheless Plato\u2019s phrase \u201cimitation of appearance\u201d does\ncharacterize artistic mim\u00easis as a compounded problem.\nImitation intensifies a weakness present in existing objects; it not\nonly fails but fails twice, or doubly.\n\nSkipping ahead for a moment, the Republic\u2019s reader finds a\nsecond three-way distinction (601c-602a) that criticizes imitation\nfrom another perspective:\n\nUser (of a flute or bridle) who knows.\nMaker (of flute or bridle) who has correct belief.\nImitator (of flute or bridle) who is ignorant.\n\n\nThis new list is intriguing and hard to make sense of. The three items\nclearly belong alongside the previous three-part ranking. The\ncarpenter who makes a table resembles the leatherworker making the\nbridle; both tripartitions put the visual imitator lowest. But why do\nflautists and jockeys suddenly appear in the top spot, in place of a\ngod so supreme as to create even Forms?\n\nThe answer might appear among the particular manufactured objects that\nthese passages refer to, because for the reader familiar with Greek\nreligion both rankings evoke Athena. The couch- and table-making\ncarpenter practices a trade whose patron is Athena, while myths known\nto Plato depict her as the original user of both flute (Pindar 12th\nPythian Ode) and bridle (Pindar 13th Olympian Ode).\nIf these associations stand up under scrutiny, they put the imitator\nat the opposite pole from a god, rendering the products of imitation\nnot only lowly nothings but malevolently profane, even blasphemous\n(Pappas 2013).\n\nThe argument thus far posits painting as the default case of\nmim\u00easis (Golden 1975, Nehamas 1982, Belfiore 1984, Moss\n2007). But Socrates springboards beyond pictorial art to condemn\ntragedy and its \u201cfather\u201d Homer. Homer was ignorant, never\ntaught a useful thing to anyone (599b\u2013600e). This apparent\nad hominem attack is designed to show that poetry too\nimitates appearance. For that purpose it suffices to show that one\nesteemed poet writes without knowledge. If great poetry can come out\nof someone ignorant, then poetry must not require knowledge. Even if\nignorance is not necessary for the composition of poetry Homer\u2019s\nexample demonstrates that the two are compatible.\n\nModern readers protest: \u201cSomeone can be ignorant and still write\ngreat poetry!\u201d Plato nods in glum agreement, for this is exactly\nthe problem. What good will come of an activity that can not only be\nattempted ignorantly but even succeeded at in ignorance? Poetry too\ntherefore imitates no more than appearance.\n\nIt remains for Plato to argue that poetry harms the soul. He says that\npoetry\u2019s illusions fortify the worst part of the soul and turn it\nagainst the best. The first stretch of this argument (602c\u2013603b)\nuses theoretical language taken from the Republic\u2019s\npsychological theory, while the second (603b\u2013608b) appeals to\nobservable phenomena surrounding performances of tragedies.\n\nSocrates returns to his analogy between poetry and painting. If you\nare partly taken in by a painting\u2019s tricked-up table apparition but\nyou partly spot the falseness, which part of you does which? The\nsoul\u2019s rational impulse must be the part that knows the painting is\nnot a real table. But Book 4 established a fundamental principle: When\nthe soul inclines in more than one direction, this conflict represents\nthe work of more than one faculty or part of the soul (436b; recalled\nin Book 10\u2019s argument at 602e). So being taken in by an optical or\nartistic illusion must be the activity of some part of the soul\ndistinct from reason.\n\nInvoking Book 4\u2019s psychological theory integrates the critique of\npoetry of Book 10 into the Republic\u2019s overarching argument.\nThe dialogue as a whole identifies justice with a balance among\nreason, spirit or anger, and the desires. This controlled balance is\nthe happiest state available for human souls, and the most virtuous.\nImitation undoes the soul\u2019s justice, it brings both vice and\nmisery.\n\nPlato does not specify the irrational part in question. Thinking the\nsun is the size of your hand does not feel like either anger\noverwhelming you or desires tempting. What do illusions have to do\nwith irrationality of motive?\n\nAgain commentaries differ. A complex and fertile debate continues to\nworry over how perceptual error may undermine mental health or moral\nintegrity (Nehamas 1982, Moss 2007). Part of the answer comes from\nBooks 8\u20139, which sketch four character types graded from best to\nworst. These are eid\u00ea \u201ckinds\u201d of soul in a\ndifferent sense, not the species of motives within a soul but the\nspecies that souls may be sorted into. This sorting deserves to play a\nlarger role than it has in the discussion of imitation.\n\nThe pleasures of the lowest soul are distinguished by their illusory\nquality. Desire delights not in true beings but in \u201cidols\n[eid\u00f4lois] of true pleasure\u201d and painted images,\neskiagraph\u00eamenais (586b). Skiagraphia was an\nimpressionistic manner of painting that juxtaposed contrasting hues to\ncreate illusionistic shadow and intensify color (Keuls 1974, Demand\n1975, Petraki 2018), and Plato disapproved of it (Parmenides\n165c\u2013d, Phaedo 69b). (In fact the Republic\u2019s\nattacks on painting are sometimes interpreted narrowly as applying\nonly to skiagraphia.) Thus where Book 9 examines the desirous\npart of the soul and finds its objects to be mere idols, Book 10\ndetermines mim\u00easis to be a show of mere idols and\nconcludes that it keeps company with the soul\u2019s desirous part.\n\nNotice especially the terminology in Book 9. The tyrant is \u201cat\nthe third remove\u201d from the oligarch, his pleasure \u201ca\nthird-place idol [trit\u00f4i eid\u00f4l\u00f4i]\u201d\ncompared to the truth (al\u00eatheia) of the oligarchic\nsoul\u2019s pleasure (587c). Meanwhile the oligarch\u2019s soul stands third\nbelow the \u201ckingly man [tou basilikou]\u201d (587d).\nOnly ten pages later Book 10 echoes this terminology when it calls the\nimitator \u201cthird from the king [basile\u00f4s] and from\nthe truth [al\u00eatheias]\u201d (597e; cf. 602c). The\nlanguage in Book 10 brings Book 9\u2019s equation of base pleasures with\nillusory ones into its attack on art. If Book 10 can show that an art\nform fosters interest in illusions it will have gone a long way toward\nshowing that the art form keeps company with irrational desires.\n\nAnother essential step in the argument is the recognition that what\nBook 3 acknowledged as an exception to its critique, namely the\nimitation of virtuous thoughtful characters, is not apt to exist.\nSocrates has tragedy in mind (comedy secondarily) and observes that\nplaywrights neither know the quiet philosophical type nor profit from\nputting that type on stage before spectators who came to the theater\nto see something showily agitated (604e\u2013605a). At one stroke\nPlato intensifies his condemnation of mim\u00easis, no\nlonger a dangerous technique when it presents the wrong kinds of\npeople but a technique that seldom presents any other kind.\n\nTragedy\u2019s hero, inherently impulsive and impassioned, acts contrary to\nthe dictates of reason. An illusion of virtue guides him. His son dies\nand he doesn\u2019t save his tears for a private moment but lets them flow\npublicly and at length (603e\u2013604a). The spectators\u2019 reason is\nappalled; their other impulses rejoice (605c\u2013e). They reckon\nthat there is no harm in weeping along with the hero, enjoying an\nemotional release without the responsibility one feels in real-life\nsituations. Thus does dramatic illusion induce bad habits of indulging\nthe passions; the soul that had spent its life learning self-control\nsets about unlearning it.\n\nIncidentally this argument turns on an assumption that Plato asserts\nwithout discussion, that mim\u00easis is the presentation or\nrepresentation of characters (e.g. 603c; 605a, c). Although Book 10\nsometimes speaks of mim\u00easis in other terms\n(mim\u00easis of virtues: 600e), the argument about\nfostering passions requires that objects of poetic representation be\nhumans. When what we call literary works practice what we\ncall representation, Plato claims that they represent human\nbeings. For him as for Aristotle drama presents prattontas\n\u201cpeople doing things,\u201d but where Aristotle emphasizes the\nthings done, for Plato it is the people. Character is the essence of\nepic and drama. (Halliwell 1988 argues otherwise.)\n\nPlato\u2019s emphasis on character already predisposes him not to find\nphilosophical worth in literature. A character speaks from a single\npoint of view. Bring several characters together representing several\nidiosyncratic perspectives on the world and the very idea of deriving\na general statement from the work becomes impossible (Laws\n719c\u2013d). This situation is as it were the dramatic corollary to\na general principle in mim\u00easis, that it represents\nplurality or multiplicity and so is forever indeterminate,\nundeterminable.\n2.4 Sophist and other passages\n\nPlato\u2019s interpreters sometimes play up the passages in which he seems\nto counter the Republic\u2019s anti-poetic comments with hopeful\nassessments of imitation. According to the standard chronology of the\ndialogues, the relevant passages occur in dialogues written after the\nRepublic. If Plato changed his views over time, these\nconciliatory remarks could indicate that he ultimately disavowed the\ncensorship of Republic 10.\n\nThe Statesman for instance calls existing constitutions\nmim\u00eamata of moral truths as the philosophical\nlegislators know those truths (297c). Such likeness-making is not\nfraud, for its outcome remains something worthy of respect. One can\nsay the same for scientific theories in Plato\u2019s Timaeus,\nwhose main speaker Timaeus argues that discourse about the natural\nworld mimics the intelligible world (47c). The Laws sees\nimitation in music as a potentially accurate process (668b); the\nhard-to-date Menexenus urges the young to imitate their\nelders\u2019 virtues (236e, 248e). All these passages suggest, from\ndifferent angles, a rehabilitation for the process that Plato\nelsewhere demeans as counterfeiting (Robinson 2016).\n\nNevertheless these passages do scarcely more than touch on\nmim\u00easis. What Plato says about imitation when he has\nset out to define and evaluate it ought to weigh more heavily than a\nuse of the word he makes briefly. Anyway the later dialogues do not\nspeak as one. Plato\u2019s Sophist, a companion to the\nStatesman, devotes much of its length to understanding\nmim\u00easis, and the context is derogatory.\n\nThe Sophist looks into imitation in order to define what a\nsophist is. But the sophist\u2014whom the main speaker calls an\nimitator (mim\u00eat\u00eas) and sorcerer\n(go\u00eat\u00eas) (235a)\u2014is not far removed from the\ndeceiving poet (Notomi 2011). And although the Sophist\u2019s\ntheory of imitation diverges somewhat from the one in\nRepublic 10, similarities between them preponderate. Like the\nRepublic the Sophist characterizes imitation\nmockingly as the creation of a whole world, and accuses imitation of\nmisleading the unwary (234b\u2013c), even if it also predicts more\noptimistically that people grow up to see through false likenesses\n(234d). Again as in Republic 10 imitation is contrasted with\na god\u2019s work\u2014except that in the Sophist gods make all\nliving things (265c\u2013d) and also images, eid\u00f4la\n(266a): dreams, shadows, reflections.\n\nMost importantly, the representation that Plato charges the sophist\nwith is fraudulent. It is the kind that makes not an honest likeness\n(eikasia) but an illusory image, a phantasma\n(235d\u2013236b). Makers of realistic statues are attending not to\nwhat a human figure really looks like but to what looking at it is\nlike. In drawing the distinction between these kinds of\nrepresentations the Sophist does strike a conciliatory tone\nnot found in Republic 10, for it seems that a branch of the\nmimetic profession retains the power to produce a reliable likeness of\nan object. But the consolation proves fleeting. Reliable imitation\nplays no role in a definition of sophists, would presumably play no\nrole in talk of poets either, and seems to make an appearance here\nonly for the purpose of being shuffled offstage as the excluded\nmim\u00easis, that which the imitation being talked about\nis not.\n\nThe Sophist decisively marginalizes positive imitation when\nit takes up mim\u00easis a second time, subdividing the\nproduction of illusions to identify a species in which imitators use\ntheir own voice and bodies: \u201cThis part is called imitation\n[mim\u00easis]\u201d (267a). The Eleatic Stranger who is\nspeaking recognizes that he has appropriated the general word for the\nspecific act of enacting false images. \u201cLet\u2019s designate this to\nbe what we call the imitative profession\n[mim\u00eatikon]\u201d; everything else in the large genus\ncan go by some other name (267a).\n\nNarrowing the process down to impersonation should make clear that\nPlato finds a sophist\u2019s imitativeness to be much like a poet\u2019s.\nMoreover this development neutralizes the suggestions that\nmim\u00easis has its good side. The imitative\ntechn\u00ea will have many manifestations, including those\nlegitimate practices that the Statesman and other dialogues\nrefer to; but the real work of mim\u00easis, the one that is\nworth defining and applies to dominant art forms, is mendacious\nimpersonation. Where Republic 3\u2019s taxonomy made imitation\nlook like a freakish variety of narration, this use of a word both\ngenerically and specially excludes good imitation as the exception and\nthe problem case. Essentially speaking the art of\nmim\u00easis is a bad and lying art.\n\nAfter all, as the Stranger says, there is a shortage of names for\ntypes of mim\u00easis. The ancients did not work hard enough\nmaking all relevant philosophical distinctions (267d). It is as if\nPlato were saying: \u201cColloquial language being loose, I will\nsometimes use mim\u00easis in the broader sense that\ncontains epistemically sound practices, even though the core sense of\nthe word is pejorative.\u201d\n\nWhether Plato should be permitted to juggle words\u2019 meanings\nis another question. His quest to condemn imitation leaves him open to\ncriticism. But he does not consciously change his theory in the\ndirection of imitation understood positively.\n2.5 Closing assessment\n\nThe Sophist\u2019s references to divine copy-making invite another\nworry. The images that gods produce in their kind of imitation are\nshadows and reflections, and the products of truly bad\nmim\u00easis are to be something worse than that. But what\ncould be metaphysically lower than a shadow? Coming back to the\nRepublic one finds shadows and reflections occupying the\nbottom-most domain of the Divided Line (510a). Where does poetic\nimitation belong on that ranking?\n\nOne can articulate the same worry even remaining with the\nRepublic\u2019s terms. Shadows and reflections belong in the\ncategory of near-ignorance. Imitation works an effect worse than\nignorance, not merely teaching nothing but engendering a perverted\npreference for ignorance over knowledge. Plato often observes that the\nignorant prefer to remain as they are (Symposium 204a), but\nthis turn toward ignorance is different. Why would anyone choose to\nknow less? The theoretical question is also a practical one. If\nmim\u00easis poisons the soul, why do so many people swallow\nit? Plato\u2019s attack on poetry saddles him with an aesthetic problem of\nevil.\n\nRepublic 10 shows signs of addressing the problem with\nlanguage of magic. Socrates begins by promising that insight into\nmim\u00easis operates as a countercharm (595b). People need\ncountercharms because the imitator is a \u201csorcerer\n[go\u00eat\u00eas]\u201d and thereby a deceiver (598d; cf.\n602d). The Republic already said that sorcery robs people of\nknowledge (413b\u2013c). Finally the catalog of Homer\u2019s kinds of\nignorance ends by saying his poetry casts a spell (601b). As the\nEnglish \u201ccharm\u201d does, this noun\nk\u00eal\u00easis can mean \u201cappeal\u201d but also\nsomething fully magical, a spell or conjuration. Poetry works\nmagically to draw in the audience that it then degrades.\n\nReferences to magic serve poorly as explanations but they bespeak the\nneed for explanation. Plato sees that some power must be drawing\npeople to give up both knowledge and the taste for knowledge. But what\nis striking about this deus ex machina that explains poetry\u2019s\nattractiveness is what it does not say. In other dialogues\nthe magic of poetry is attributed to one version or another of divine\ninspiration. Odd that the Republic makes no reference to\ninspiration when dialogues as different as the Apology and\nthe Laws mention it and the Ion and the\nPhaedrus spell out how it works. Odder still, Plato almost\nnever cites imitation and divine inspiration together (the lone\nexception Laws 719c), as if to say that the two are\nincompatible accounts of poetry. Will inspiration play a role\nancillary to imitation, or do the two approaches to poetry have\nnothing to do with one another?\n3. Divine Inspiration\n\nIn simplest form \u201cinspiration\u201d names the claim that poets\nare aided in producing their own poetry. At lucky moments a god takes\nthem over and brings value to the poem that it could not have had\notherwise.\n\nInspiration of that kind is a common idea. Either a divine source\nprovides the poet with information needed for writing the poem\n(information about past events or the gods\u2019 lives, for example); or\nmore generally the source gives the poet the talent needed for writing\nanything. The idea is far from original with Plato. Within Greek\nculture alone there are Homer and Hesiod, who begin their great works\nasking a Muse to \u201cspeak into\u201d them. In this case, by\ncontrast with that of imitation, Plato finds a new use for an idea\nthat has a cultural and religious meaning before him (Ledbetter 2003,\nMurray 1981, Tigerstedt 1970).\n\nPlato\u2019s version of the idea has proved to be durable and influential.\nThe old chestnut about a fine line between genius and insanity is only\nthe best-known legacy of Platonic inspiration, as popularized in one\nway by Cesare Lombroso\u2019s work on \u201cpsychiatric art\u201d\n(Lombroso 1891, 2); in another way by Shelley, who translated the\nIon in 1821 believing its account of poetic madness supported\nhis own defense of poetry (Shelley 1840).\n\nThe topic occurs throughout Plato\u2019s corpus. Platonic characters\nmention inspiration in dialogues as far apart\u2014in date of\ncomposition; in style, length, content\u2014as the Apology\nand the Laws, though for different purposes. Socrates on\ntrial tells of his frustrated effort to learn from poets. Their verses\nseemed excellent but the authors themselves had nothing to say about\nthem (Apology 22b). Socrates concludes that poets work\ninstinctively and while inspired, enthousiazontes, as\nprophets and soothsayers also do (theomanteis,\nchr\u00easm\u00f4idoi), as opposed to writing on the basis\nof sophia (22c). The opposition between wisdom and\ninspiration does not condemn poets. They write by some nature\n(phusei tini), as if inspiration were a normally occurring\nhuman instinct.\n\nFor its part Laws 719c links the effects of inspiration to\nthe nature of drama and its multiple perspectives: \n\nWhen the poet sits on the Muse\u2019s tripod [en t\u00f4i tripodi\nt\u00eas Mous\u00eas] he is not in his right mind\n[emphr\u00f4n] but ready to flow like a fountain; and\nbecause his profession [techn\u00ea] is that of imitation\n[mim\u00ease\u00f4s], then in creating people\n[anthr\u00f4pous] who are set against one another he is\ncompelled to contradict himself frequently, and he does not know\n[oiden] whether these or the other thing of what he says are\ntrue [al\u00eath\u00ea]. But it is not for a lawmaker to\nmake two statements about a single topic in a law. (719c\u2013d)\n\n\nAs in the Republic, mim\u00easis leaves the\nspectator with no truths to evaluate or wish to assess them. And, as\nin the Apology, inspiration means the poet has no truths to\ntransmit. When the god\u2019s power comes the poet\u2019s\ngoes. Lawmakers work differently from that. And this contrast between\ninspiration and the origin of laws\u2014occurring in a dialogue\ndevoted to discovering the best laws for cities\u2014hardly suggests\nan endorsement for inspiration.\n\nBut it is also true that the passage puts the poet on a tripod, symbol\nof Apollo\u2019s priestesses. Whatever brings a poet to write verse brings\ndivine wisdom out of priestesses; and Plato regularly defers to the\nauthority of oracles. Even supposing that talk of inspiration denies\nindividual control and credit to the poet, the priestess shows that\ncredit and control are not all that matters. She is at her best when\nher mind intrudes least on what she is saying. Her pronouncements have\nthe prestige they do, not despite her loss of control, but because of\nit (Pappas 2012a).\n\nAnother passage in the Laws says as much when it attributes\neven reliable historical information to poets writing under\nthe influence of the Muses and Graces (682a). The Meno makes\ninspiration its defining example of ignorant truth-speaking.\nPoliticians are just like \u201cprophets and soothsayers\n[chr\u00easm\u00f4idoi, theomanteis].\u201d All three,\n\u201cwhen inspired [enthousi\u00f4ntes], speak truly\n[al\u00eath\u00ea] about many things, but do not know what\nthey are talking about\u201d (99c). Removing all doubt about the\norigin of that truth, Socrates calls prophets, soothsayers, and all\npoets theioi \u201cdivine\u201d because of how well they\nspeak without possessing knowledge (99c\u2013d).\n\nIn these more tangential remarks in the Apology,\nLaws, and Meno, Plato seems to be affirming 1) that\ninspiration is really divine in origin, and 2) that this divine action\nthat gives rise to poetry guarantees value in the result. It may\nremain the case that the poet knows nothing. But something good must\ncome of an inspiration shared by poets and priestesses, and often\nenough that good is truth.\n3.1 Ion\n\nPlato\u2019s shortest dialogue, the Ion is the only one that most\nreaders would clearly situate within aesthetics. It does not address\npoetry alone. The character Ion is a performer and interpreter of\nHomer\u2019s poems, not a poet. Meanwhile, most of what are classed as arts\ntoday\u2014painting, sculpture, music\u2014appear as activities for\nwhich the problems of irrationality and knowledge signally\nfail to arise (532e\u2013533c; for painting as\ntechn\u00ea cf. Gorgias 448c, Protagoras\n312d). Nevertheless the Ion belongs in aesthetics by virtue\nof its focus on artistic inspiration, and the question it provokes of\nwhat inspiration implies about poetry\u2019s merits.\n\nAs a rhapsode Ion travels among Greek cities reciting and explicating\nepisodes from Homer. Between the dramatic recitation and the\ninterpretation, these performances offered much latitude for displays\nof talent, and Ion\u2019s talent has won him first prize at a contest in\nEpidaurus. (For some discussion of the rhapsode\u2019s work see Gonzalez\n2011, Gonz\u00e1lez 2013.)\n\nHis conversation with Socrates falls into three parts, covering\nidiosyncrasy (530a\u2013533c), inspiration\n(533c\u2013536d), and ignorance (536d\u2013542b). Both the\nfirst and the third sections support the claims made in the second,\nwhich should be seen as the conclusion to the dialogue, supported in\ndifferent ways by the discussions that come before and after it. The\nidiosyncrasy in Ion\u2019s attachment to Homer shows that Homer, and Ion\nbecause of him, function thanks to a divine visitation. But because\nIon resists accepting a claim according to which he is deranged in his\nperformances, Socrates presents a fall-back argument. Ion is\nunqualified to assess any of the factual claims that appear in Homer,\nabout medicine, chariot racing, or anything else. When Socrates\ncompels him to choose between divine inspiration and a very drab brand\nof knowing nothing, Ion agrees to be called inspired.\n\nThis is to say that although poets\u2019 and their readers\u2019 ignorance is\nindeed a fact for Plato, it is a fact in need of interpretation.\nWhether it means as in the Ion that gods inspire poetry, or\nas in Republic 10 that imitative poetry imitates appearance\nalone, ignorance matters less than the implications drawn from it.\nMoreover, ignorance alone will not demonstrate that poets are\npossessed by the gods. The proof of Ion\u2019s ignorance supports\ninspiration but does not suffice to generate that doctrine. Even if\nIon\u2019s ignorance takes up the last part of the dialogue, it is not\nPlato\u2019s last word about poetry.\n\nThe idiosyncrasy treated in this dialogue\u2019s opening section, by\ncomparison, is (for Plato) irrational on its face. The idiosyncrasy\nappears as soon as Socrates asks Ion about his techn\u00ea\n(530b). That essential Platonic word has been mistranslated\n\u201cart\u201d or \u201ccraft.\u201d \u201cSkill\u201d is not\nbad; but perhaps a techn\u00ea most resembles a\nprofession. The word denotes both a paying occupation and the\npossession of expertise. In Ion\u2019s case Socrates specifies that the\nexpertise for a rhapsode includes the ability to interpret poetry\n(530c). Ion rates himself superior at that task to all his competitors\nbut concedes that he can only interpret Homer (531a). Even though\nHomer and other poets sometimes address the same subjects, Ion has\nnothing to say about those other poets. He confesses this fact without\nshame or apology, as if his different responses reflected on the poets\ninstead of on his talents. Something in Homer makes him eloquent, and\nother poets lack that quality.\n\nSocrates argues that one who knows a field knows it whole\n(531e\u2013532a). This denial of the knowledge of particulars in\ntheir particularity also appears at Charmides 166e;\nPhaedo 97d; Republic 334a, 409d. It is not that what\nis known about an individual thing cannot transfer to other\nthings of the same kind; rather that the act of treating an object as\nunique means attending to and knowing those qualities of it that\ndo not transfer, knowing them as nontransferable qualities.\nThis attitude toward particulars qua particulars is an\nobstacle to every theoretical expertise. It is the epistemic analogue\nto the irrational one-on-one erotic bond that Aristophanes describes\nin Plato\u2019s Symposium (191c-d).\n\nIt may well be that what Ion understands about Homer happens to hold\ntrue of Hesiod. But if this is the case, Ion will not know it. He does\nnot generalize from one to many poets, and generalizing is the mark of\na professional. Diotima\u2019s speech in the Symposium supplies a\nuseful comparison. She differentiates between love that clings to\nparticular objects and a philosophical er\u00f4s that\nescapes its attachment to particulars to pursue general knowledge\n(210b). Ion\u2019s investment in Homer, like the lover\u2019s lowest grade of\nattachment, reveals (and also causes) an unwillingness to move toward\nunderstanding.\n\nAnd so Ion presents Socrates with a conundrum. Although the man\u2019s love\nfor Homer prohibits him from possessing expertise, Socrates recognizes\nhow well Ion performs at his job. How to account for success minus\nskill? Socrates needs to diagnose Ion by means of some positive trait\nhe possesses, not merely by the absence of knowledge.\n\nSocrates therefore speaks of poets and those they move as\nentheous. He elaborates an analogy. Picture an iron ring\nhanging from a magnet, magnetized so that a second ring hangs from the\nfirst and a third from that second one. Magnets are Muses, the rings\nattached to them poets, the second rings the poets\u2019 interpreters,\nthird the rhapsodes\u2019 audiences. (For a recent treatment of this image\nsee Wang 2016.)\n\nPlato\u2019s image captures the transferability of charisma. By being made\nof iron each ring has the capacity to take on the charge that holds\nit. But the magnetism resides in the magnet, not in the temporarily\nmagnetized rings. No ring is itself the source of the next ring\u2019s\nattachment to it. Homer analogously draws poetic power from his Muse\nand attracts a rhapsode by means of borrowed power. Ion charged with\nMusic energy collects enthusiastic fans, as if to his own\nperson and as if by techn\u00ea\u2014but only as\nif. The analogy lets poets and rhapsodes appear charismatic without\ngiving them credit for their appeal.\n\nSocrates takes a further step to pit inspiration against reason.\n\u201cEpic poets who are good at all are never masters of their\nsubject. They are inspired and possessed [entheoi ontes kai\nkatechomenoi]\u201d (533a). Inspiration now additionally means\nthat poets are irrational, as it never meant before Plato. This\nsuperadded irrationality explains why Ion rejects Socrates\u2019 proposal,\nin a passage that is frequently overlooked. He is not unhinged during\nhis performances, Ion says; not katechomenos kai mainomenos,\npossessed and maddened (536d). Inspiration has come to imply madness\nand the madness in it is what Ion tries to reject.\n\nWhat went wrong? The image of rings and magnets is slyer than it\nappeared. While the analogy rests transparently on one feature of\nmagnetism, the transfer of attraction, it also smuggles in a second\nfeature. Socrates describes iron rings hanging in straight lines or\nbranching: Although each ring may have more than a single ring\ndependent upon it, no ring is said to hang from more than one. But\nreal rings hang in other ways, all the rings clumped against the\nmagnet, or one ring clinging to two or three above it. Why does\nSocrates keep the strings of rings so orderly?\n\nHere is one suggestion. Keeping Homer clung only to his Muse,and Ion\nclung only to Homer, preserves the idiosyncrasy that let Socrates deny\nexpertise to Ion. For otherwise a magnet and rings would show how\ngenuine knowledge is transmitted. Suppose you say that a Muse leads\nthe doctor Hippocrates to diagnostic insights that he tells his\nstudents and they tell theirs. That much divine help is all that the\nimage of magnet and rings strictly implies, and it is no threat to a\nprofession\u2019s understanding of itself. But no one would claim that a\ndoctor can learn only from a single other doctor, or that a doctor\ntreats a unique group of adulatory patients. That constraint on\nmedical practice would threaten its status as techn\u00ea;\nand that is exactly the constraint added by the array of rings as\nSocrates describes it. (For a contrasting and compelling reading of\nthis passage see Chapter 3 of Capra 2015.)\n\nAnalogies always introduce new traits into the thing being described.\nThat is in the nature of analogical thinking and no grounds for\nsuspicion. Plato\u2019s readers should become suspicious because the\nfeature that slips into this figure, the orderly hanging of the rings,\nis neither called for by the way iron actually transmits magnetic\nforce, nor neutral in effect. Plato has distorted magnetism to make it\nmean not inspiration simpliciter but something crazy.\n\nThe combination of possession and madness in the Ion\u2019s\nversion of inspiration makes it hard to decide whether the dialogue\nimplies some approval for inspired poetry or condemns it entirely.\nReaders have drawn opposite morals from this short work. (On the\ndebate see Stern-Gillet 2004.) As Socrates characterizes\nenthousiasmos, it denies Ion\u2019s professional credibility, not\nto mention his sanity. But there is religion to think of. If not\ntraditionally pious, Plato is also not the irreverent type who would\nascribe an action to divinities in order to mock it. And consider the\nexample of inspired verse mentioned here. Socrates cites Tynnichus,\nauthor of only one passable poem, which was a tribute to the Muses\n(534d). It\u2019s as if the Muses wanted to display their power, Socrates\nsays, by proving that their intervention could elicit a good poem even\nfrom an unskilled author. If this is Socrates\u2019 paradigm of inspired\npoetry, then whatever else inspiration also explains, it appears\nparticularly well suited to producing praise of the gods. And praise\nof the gods is the lone poetic form that Plato respects and accepts\n(Republic 607a).\n\nFinally there is a version of the same problem that arose regarding\nthe Apology, Laws, and Meno, that the\nIon calls soothsayers and diviners possessed\n(chr\u00easm\u00f4idos, mantis: 534d). That already seems\nto justify inspiration. Add in that Socrates calls the diviner\u2019s\npractice a techn\u00ea (538e; cf. 531b) and this dialogue\nseems to be saying that an activity can be both professional and the\nresult of divine possession. So what does the charge of madness mean?\nThe word makes Ion recoil\u2014but what does he know about higher\nstates of understanding? Maybe madness itself needs to be reconceived.\nThe Ion says far from enough to settle the question. But\nPlato\u2019s other sustained discussion of inspiration returns to the\nlanguage of madness and finds some forms of it permissible, even\nphilosophical.\n3.2 Phaedrus\n\nWhen introducing the Phaedrus\u2019s major speech on\ner\u00f4s (244a\u2013250d), Socrates defines desirous love\nas a species of mania, madness, in a context that comments on\nphilosophy and poetry with an aside about mim\u00easis a few\npages later. Although other sections of the Phaedrus are\nrelevant to Platonic aesthetics, this is the only part directly about\ninspiration.\n\nSocrates\u2019 speech begins by sorting out mania. Madness comes\nin two general forms: the diseased state of mental dysfunction, and a\ndivergence from ordinary rationality that a god sometimes brings (see\n265a\u2013b). Divine madness subdivides into love, Dionysian frenzy,\noracular prophecy, and poetic composition (244b\u2013245a). In all\nfour cases the possessed or inspired person\n(enthousiaz\u00f4n: 241e, 249e, 253a, 263d) can accomplish\nwhat is impossible for someone in a sane state. All four cases are\nassociated with particular deities and traditionally honored.\n\nOn reconciling the possession described in the Ion with that\nin the Phaedrus, see Gonzalez 2011 for extended discussion.\nIn abbreviated terms we can say that the madness of the\nPhaedrus is separated from ordinary madness as the\nIon\u2019s version is not, and is classified pointedly as\ngood derangement. Being a god, Eros can\u2019t do anything bad\n(242d\u2013e). The greatest blessings flow from divine mania\n(244a). \n\nNor is this possessed condition associated with idiosyncrasy in the\nPhaedrus. On the contrary. To account for the madness of love\nSocrates describes an otherworldly existence in which souls ride\nacross the top of heaven enjoying direct visions of the Forms\n(247c\u2013d). After falling into bodily existence a soul responds to\nbeauty more avidly than it does to any other qualities for which there\nare Forms.\n\nAssociating beauty with inspiration suggests that poetry born of\n(another kind of) inspiration might also have philosophical worth. But\nbefore welcoming the lost sheep Plato back to the poetry-loving fold,\nrecognize the Phaedrus\u2019s qualifying remarks about which\npoetry one may now prize. It cannot be imitative. When Socrates ranks\nhuman souls depending on how much otherworldly being they saw before\nfalling into bodily form\u2014philosophers come in first on this\nranking\u2014the poet or other mim\u00eatikos occupies\nsixth place out of nine (248e).\n\nIndeed the argument of the Phaedrus only identifies a single\ntype of poem that the Muses call forth: the poem that\n\u201cembellishes thousands of deeds of the ancients to educate\n[paideuei] later generations\u201d (245a). But Plato exempts\nhymns to gods and encomia of heroes from even his harshest\ncondemnation of poetry (Republic 607a). Quite compatibly with\nthe Republic\u2019s exemption the Ion specifies a hymn to\nthe Muses as its example of inspiration and the Phaedrus\ndescribes the praise of heroes. Whenever possible Plato reserves the\nbenefits of inspiration for the poems he does not have reason to\ncondemn. And this restriction on which poems derive a true merit from\nbeing inspired leaves inspiration a long way from guaranteeing\npoetry\u2019s value.\n4. Imitation, Inspiration, Beauty\n\nMim\u00easis fails in two ways. 1) It originates in\nappearance rather than in reality, so that judged on its own terms the\nproduct of imitation has an ignoble pedigree (Republic 603b).\n2) The imitative arts positively direct a soul toward appearances,\naway from proper objects of inquiry. A mirror reflection might prompt\nyou to turn around and look at the thing being reflected; an imitation\nkeeps your eyes on the copy alone. Imitation has a base cause and\nbaser effects.\n\nAlthough the dialogues offer few arguments for the second claim, the\nperverseness with which mim\u00easis leads one to prefer\nappearance partly follows from a contrast between traditional visual\nart and its later developments. Aeschylus had, they say, already\npraised the religiosity of the rougher old visual forms, by comparison\nwith later visually exciting statues that inspired less of a sense of\ndivinity (Porphyry On Abstinence from Animal Food 2.18).\nEarly votive objects, sometimes no more representative than a plank or\noblong stone, were treated as markers of the gods\u2019 presence and points\nof contact with unseen powers (Faraone 1992, Collins 2003). Stone and\nwooden figures could serve as surrogates for absent humans, as when\nmourners buried an effigy in place of an irrecoverable body (Herodotus\nHistories 6.58; Vernant 2006, 322; Bremmer 2013), or treated\na grave marker as if it were the buried person (Euripides\nAlcestis 348\u2013356; see Burkert 1985, 193\u2013194).\nWhereas the mimetic relationship connects a visible likeness with its\nvisible original, such objects though visible link to invisible\nreferents.\n\nPlato seems to distinguish between the pious old art and its\nmodernized forms, as he distinguishes analogously among poems. Statues\nsuggest communication with divinities (Laws 931a,\nPhaedrus230b). Wax likenesses participate in the magic of\neffigies (Laws 933b). Metaphorically the dialogues imagine a\nbody as a statue that invites comparison with its invisible referent\nthe soul (Charmides 154c, 157d-158c; Symposium 215b,\n216d-e), or as a s\u00eama \u201ctomb\u201d but also\n\u201csign\u201d of the soul within (Cratylus 400b-c,\nGorgias 493a). Compared to such referential relations, the\nmimetic art object\u2019s reference to what is visible can feel like a\nforcible misdirection of attention to appearances and to delight with\nvisibility as such.\n\nBeauty by comparison begins in the domain of intelligible objects,\nsince there is a Form of beauty. And more than any other property for\nwhich a Form exists, beauty engages the soul and draws it toward\nphilosophical deliberation, toward thoughts of absolute beauty and\nsubsequently (as we imagine) toward thoughts of other concepts.\n\nPlato therefore hates to acknowledge that poems contain any beauty. He\ndoes not go so far as to call mim\u00easis beauty\u2019s\ncontrary, accusing poems or paintings of ugliness. He hardly could. It\nis bad enough for his view that he does not account for an imitative\npoem\u2019s appeal; to deny the appeal would rob his account of all\nplausibility.\n\nNor can a good (philosophical) version of imitation work as opposite\nto the poetic kind. Plato recognizes a salutary function that\nimitations sometimes have, even the function of drawing the mind\ntoward knowledge. But he offers no more than hints about positive\nmim\u00easis. There is no account of sound imitation that\nwould counterweigh the attacks in the Republic. In any case\nthis is a constructive turn that never seems to be made available to\npoems or paintings. If good imitation does exist, its home is not\namong the arts. Still the idea invites a worthwhile question: Is there\nanything human beings can produce that would function\noppositely to mimetic poetry? Inspiration is the most promising\npossibility.\n\nThe cause behind inspiration is unimpeachable, for it begins in the\ndivine realm. Is that a realm of Forms? The Phaedrus comes\nclosest to saying so, both by associating the gods with Forms\n(247c\u2013e), and by rooting inspired love in recollection (251a).\nBut this falls short of showing that the poets\u2019 divine madness\nlikewise originates among objects of greater reality. It might, but\ndoes not have to.\n\nThe Ion says less about poetry\u2019s divine origins than the\nPhaedrus, certainly nothing that requires an interpreter to\ndiscover Forms within the Muse\u2019s magnetism. Laws 682a and\nMeno 99c\u2013d credit the inspired condition with the\nproduction of truths, even in poetry. Neither passage describes the\ntruths about Forms that philosophical dialectic would lead to, but\nthat might be asking too much. Let it suffice that inspiration\noriginates in some truth.\n\nWhat about the effects of inspired poetry? Could such poetry\nturn a soul toward knowledge as beautiful faces do? Would it always do\nso? Poetry\u2019s defenders will find scant support for that proposal in\nthe dialogues. Inspired poetry has its merits but Plato rarely credits\nit with promoting philosophical knowledge. In fact the Ion\nconceives inspiration as the cause of the worst cognitive state, for\nthe poet\u2019s possession by the Muses is what attaches the audience\n(irrationally, particularly-minded) to that one poet. The\nPhaedrus does say that Muse-made poems teach future\ngenerations about the exploits of heroes. Inspired poetry at least\nmight set a good example. But one can find good examples in verse\nwithout waiting for inspiration. Even Republic 3 allows for\ninstances in which the young guardians imitate virtuous characters.\nThe educational consequences of inspired poetry do not set it apart\nfrom imitative poetry, and they never include philosophical\neducation.\n\nA clear opposition between imitation and inspiration, or any clear\nrelationship between them, would suggest a coherent whole that can be\ntitled \u201cPlato\u2019s aesthetics.\u201d In the absence of such a\nrelationship it is hard to attribute an aesthetic theory to Plato as\none can straightforwardly do with Aristotle.\n\nIf unification is possible for the elements of Plato\u2019s aesthetics,\nthat may arrive from another direction. Religion has not been explored\nas much as it should in connection with Plato\u2019s aesthetics, even\nthough a religious orientation informs what he has to say about\nbeauty, inspiration, and imitation. The quasi-divine status that\nbeauty has in the Symposium; the Republic\u2019s\ncharacterization of the imitator as enemy to Athena and other gods;\nand of course inspiration, which cannot be defined without appeal to\ndivine action: All three subjects suggest that Plato\u2019s aesthetics\nmight come together more satisfactorily within Plato\u2019s theology. The\nquestion is worth pursuing now, for scholarship of recent decades has\nadvanced the study of Greek religion, providing unprecedented\nresources for a fresh inquiry into the fundamental terms out of which\nPlato constructs his aesthetics.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Annas, Julia, 1982. \u201cPlato on the Triviality of\nLiterature,\u201d in Moravcsik and Temko 1982, pp. 1\u201328.", "Asmis, Elizabeth, 1986. \u201cPsychagogia in Plato\u2019s\n<em>Phaedrus</em>,\u201d <em>Illinois Classical Studies</em>, 11:\n153\u2013172.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1992. \u201cPlato on Poetic\nCreativity,\u201d in Richard Kraut (ed.), 1992, <em>The Cambridge\nCompanion to Plato</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.\n338\u2013364.", "Barney, Rachel, 2010. \u201cNotes on Plato on the <em>kalon</em>\nand the Good,\u201d <em>Classical Philology</em>, 105:\n363\u2013377.", "Belfiore, Elizabeth, 1984. \u201cA Theory of Imitation in Plato\u2019s\n<em>Republic</em>,\u201d <em>Transactions of the American\nPhilological Association</em>, 114: 121\u2013146.", "Benitez, Rick and Keping Wang (eds.), 2016. <em>Reflections on\nPlato\u2019s Poetics: Essays from Beijing</em>, Berrima, Australia:\nAcademic Printing &amp;
