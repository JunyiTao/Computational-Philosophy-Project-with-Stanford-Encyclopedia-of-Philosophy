Life and Work\n\nOlivi (ca. 1248\u20131298) was born in S\u00e9rignan, in the\nLanguedoc region of southern France. He entered the Franciscan order\nat the age of twelve, studied in Paris from 1267 to about 1272 (during\nthe final years of Bonaventure\u2019s generalate) without becoming a\nmaster of theology, and spent the remainder of his life teaching at\nvarious Franciscan houses of study in southern France, with a stay in\nFlorence from 1287\u201389. (For biographical details, see Burr 1976\nand 1989, and especially Piron 1998, 1999, 2006a.) Olivi\u2019s\noutspoken originality led him into conflict with religious\nauthorities: his writings were condemned by the Franciscan authorities\nin 1283, and although he was later rehabilitated by the new minister\ngeneral Matthew of Aquasparta, he remained a controversial figure. He\nspent the last part of his life as a lector at Montpellier and\nNarbonne. Soon after his death the Franciscan order renewed the\nprohibition on reading or retaining his works. Although his\nphilosophical views were controversial, what proved to be fatal was\nhis reputation within the so-called \u201cSpiritual\u201d reform\nmovement of the Franciscan order. Olivi\u2019s understanding of the\nFranciscan vow and poverty became influential among the spiritualists,\nand after his death he was venerated by fervent laymen in Languedoc.\nWhen Church officials took action against the spiritual movement,\nOlivi\u2019s reputation suffered a blow, which limited the influence\nhe would have on posterity. (See Burr 1989, 1993, 2001.)\n\nOlivi produced a large and wide-ranging body of work, much of which\nhas survived. By far the most important philosophical text is his\nSumma of questions on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, a\nmassive work he began writing soon after leaving Paris and redacted to\nits final form in the mid-1290s. This masterpiece of medieval\nphilosophy remains still largely untranslated, and edited only in\npart. Olivi\u2019s views on metaphysics and human nature are mostly\nfound in his questions on Bk. II (ed. Jansen, 1922\u201326). Material\non the virtues is found in Bk. III (ed. Emmen and Stadter, 1981).\nOther philosophically relevant works include his Quodlibeta\nfrom 1289\u201395 (ed. Defraia, 2002), a set of questions on logic\n(ed. Brown, 1986), and the Questions on Evangelical Perfection.\nMany of his biblical commentaries, the historically significant\nCommentary on the Apocalypse, and various texts pertaining to\nhis condemnation have survived and are available in modern editions.\n(For a recent list of editions, see K\u00f6nig-Pralong et al. 2010;\nfor the dating of works, see Piron 2020a.) In this article we provide\na brief outline of the most significant philosophical views that Olivi\ndefended, both in theoretical and practical philosophy.\n2. Theoretical Philosophy\n2.1 Metaphysics\n2.1.1 Rejection of categories\n\nAccording to traditional medieval interpretation, Aristotle\u2019s\nten categories (substance and nine accidental categories, such as\nquality, quantity, and relation) represent both ontological and\nconceptual divisions of the world. On the one hand, the world really\nis divided into ten ontologically distinct types of things; and on the\nother hand, our conceptual scheme employs the ten categories because\nthere is an isomorphism between how things really are and how we\nunderstand them to be (see the entry\n on\u00a0medieval theories of the categories).\n\nThis traditional interpretation was not universally agreed upon, and\nvarious interpretations and modifications were presented, especially\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century. In particular, the realist\nidea that categories are populated by different kinds things\n(res) came under pressure. Olivi is among the first authors to\nexplicitly reject the idea that Aristotelian categories can be\nconsidered as ontologically distinct kinds of things, and he also\npoints out that Aristotle does not offer any good reason to believe\nthat there are exactly ten categories (Summa II q. 28, pp.\n490\u201391). According to Olivi, there are more ways of conceptually\ncarving the world than the Aristotelian categorical scheme, and we\ncannot infer the ontological structure of the world from our\nconceptual divisions. Olivi argues that \u201cthe diversity of modes\nof predication does not necessarily entail a diversity of modes of\nbeing, because the mode of predication follows the mode of\nunderstanding rather than the mode of being [\u2026]\u201d (ibid.,\npp. 485\u201386; see also q. 54, pp. 262\u201363). Things that\nreally exist are substances and qualities; the remaining categories\nare different ways to conceptualize things that really exist (Pini\n2008, pp. 160\u201362; Pini 2005, pp. 74\u201377; Pasnau 2011, pp.\n235\u201338).\n\nHowever, Olivi finds a simple division between really existing things\n(substances and qualities) and conceptualizations that the mind makes\ntoo coarse. Although he goes some way towards nominalism, he does not\ngo all the way (Boureau 1999, 45). In many contexts, he upholds the\nrealist intuition that our concepts are based on how things really\nare\u2014they are ontologically committing. To achieve this aim, he\nuses the notoriously difficult concept of rationes reales,\nwhich can be translated, for instance, as \u201creal aspects\u201d\n(Pini 2008, pp. 160\u201361; Pasnau 2011, p. 236), or \u201cmodes of\npartial intelligibility\u201d (Piron 2016, par. 8). The core idea is\nthat the human mind can consider the reality from different\nperspectives, by focusing on some aspect of it and leaving other\naspects aside. For instance, it is possible to think about Socrates\nfrom the point of view of his quantity. Ontologically speaking the\nobject of thought is still the individual rational substance\nSocrates\u2014the fact that we think about his quantity does not\nentail real existence of quantity as a distinct thing\n(res)\u2014but we focus only on his height and weight and, as\nit were, abstract them from him. These properties are not\nmind-dependent but real in the sense that Socrates really is of a\ncertain quantity, but the core of Olivi\u2019s view is that these\nqualities are nevertheless not ontologically distinct from\nSocrates\u2019 substance. The category of relation functions in a\nsimilar way:\n\n\nit does not seem that a relation adds anything real to that on which\nit is immediately founded, but only means another ratio realis\nof the same thing, which is real to the extent that such a\nratio of the relation really is in the thing, and not solely in\nthe intellect. But it is not really another in the sense of being\nanother \u2018thing\u2019 or essence; it is only another\nratio that is included in the thing without any difference\n[between the ratio and the thing] (Summa II q. 54, p.\n260).\n\n\nRationes reales are further distinguished from\nconceptualizations that are completely mind-dependent, the so-called\nverbal accounts (rationes secundum dici): I said\n\u2018rationes reales\u2019 because also some <other>\nrationes are attributed to things, and they do not name\nanything real or anything that is in the thing itself (a parte\nrei) but only in the intellect, or according to the intellect.\n(Summa II q. 54, p. 247; see Bettoni 1959, pp. 236\u201343;\nPiron 1999, ch. 2; Piron 2016, par. 7\u20139) The crucial difference\nbetween rationes reales and rationes secundum dici is\nthat the former are conceptualizations that are based on the nature of\nthings themselves (although they do not reflect any real ontological\ndistinctions or elements in them), while the latter are completely\nmind-dependent modes of thinking:\n\n\n[\u2026] they said that there seem to be several rationes\nreales, not only in God, but also in created things. They call\nthese rationes reales in distinction to rationes which\nconsist only of modes of being understood\u2014such are the\nratio of universality which the intellect attributes to things\nthat are considered without their individuality, and relations\nsecundum dici which posit nothing <real> in neither of\ntheir extremes or at least in the other extreme\u2014just like\n\u2018to be praised or loved\u2019 taken in passive sense posit\nnothing in the thing praised or loved. Therefore, in distinction to\nthese, they call rationes reales those, the truth of which lies\nentirely in the thing, so that they are not attributed to things on\nthe basis of various modes of understanding, but rather on the basis\nof the real nature and truth itself (Summa II q. 7, pp.\n134\u201335).\n\n\nThe ontological status of rationes reales is unclear. Some\nscholars seem to interpret them in a reductionist manner (Pini 2005,\npp. 74\u201375; Piron 2016, par. 7) but it has also been argued that\nthey, or at least some of them, should be taken as modes, understood\nas an ontological category that is distinct from substances and\naccidents but equally real (Pasnau 2011, pp. 247\u201349). Either\nway, clearly they function as a theoretical tool which is unknown to\nAristotelian metaphysics and which allows Olivi to develop rather\nnuanced positions in several metaphysical, epistemological and\ntheological questions.\n2.1.2 Universal hylomorphism and matter\n\nOlivi accepts a doctrine that is known as \u201cuniversal\nhylomorphism\u201d, i.e. the view that every substance, except God,\nis composed of form and matter. The hylomorphic scheme as such is of\ncourse taken from Aristotle, but the idea that it must be applied also\nto spiritual entities, such as the human soul and angels, is an\nextension that was popularized by Dominicus Gundissalinus. The\nphilosophical reason behind this view is related to the idea that\nforms are fully actual. Everything that can undergo a change from one\nstate to another requires potentiality, and thus all created\nsubstances must have a material constituent (Summa II q. 16, p.\n304). In particular, Olivi holds that although the human soul is a\nspiritual entity, it is not a pure form but a hylomorphic combination\nof form and what Olivi calls \u201cspiritual matter\u201d (for\ndetails and qualifications, see\n \u00a7 2.3\n below). Thus, Olivi, following Bonaventure, divides matter into two\nradically different kinds: corporeal and spiritual. All physical\nthings around us are composed of corporeal matter and a form that\nactualizes and organizes it. The metaphysical structure of spiritual\nsubstances (angels and intellectual souls) is similar but the matter\nthat enters their metaphysical composition is of a different kind.\n(Ribordy 2010; Suarez-Nani 2009, 29\u201344)\n\nMoreover, Olivi rejects the Aristotelian notion of matter as pure\npotentiality and attributes a certain level of actuality to it:\n\u201cThe essence of matter means some act or actuality, which is\nnevertheless sufficiently distinct from the act which is a form\u201d\n(Summa II q. 16, pp. 305\u20136). A number of different views\non the nature of matter were debated in the thirteenth century, and\nOlivi\u2019s theory was an original contribution to the debate.\nAccording to him, \u2018actuality\u2019 can be taken as an analogous\nnotion that applies both to forms that are actual in a\n\u201cdetermining and indeterminable\u201d way, and matter that is\nactual in an indeterminate way and needs to be perfected by a form to\nturn into an actual substance. Olivi is careful to explain that\nmatter\u2019s having both actuality and potentiality does not mean\nthat it is composed of act and potency, as if from form and\nmatter. Rather, the actuality of matter is indeterminate and in that\nsense it is the same thing as the potentiality of matter, and\ntherefore these two aspects of matter should be understood as two\nrationes, which do not introduce any real distinction (ibid.,\npp. 309\u201310; see Rodolfi 2010; Suarez-Nani 2009, 29\u201344).\nHowever, Olivi rejects Bonaventure\u2019s theory of seminal reasons\n(rationes seminales), i.e. the idea that matter was imbued in\nthe creation with latent structures that are actualized over time and\nthus explain the emergence of new substantial forms from the\npotentiality of matter. He accepts the term itself, but proposes a\ndeflationary interpretation of it as various forms of efficient\ncausality (Summa II q. 31).\n2.1.3 Causality\n\nIt has been argued that Olivi is one of the few medieval authors to\nargue that God is not a concurrent cause of actions of created beings\n(Frost 2014; the following is based on this article). Although not a\ncompletely novel idea, this position was almost obsolete in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries; the only author in addition to\nOlivi to defend it was Durandus of St. Pour\u00e7ain (ca.\n1275\u20131332). Medieval authors typically argued that God is the\nuniversal first cause and, as such, he must directly take part in\nevery causal process that is brought about by created things. This\nposition, known as \u201cconcurrentism,\u201d was defended as an\neffort avoid occasionalism (defended mainly by Islamic philosophers)\nwhile preserving the theological idea that nothing in this world\nhappens or exists without God.\n\nIt should be emphasised that Olivi accepts the idea that nothing can\nremain in existence without God (Summa II q. 116, p. 346:\n\u201cThat which arises indirectly from the first cause requires the\nfirst causes\u2019s power and sustenance no less than does that which\narises immediately. Hence at the cessation of God\u2019s entire\ninfluence it would be deprived of its existence no less than would\nthose things that arise immediately\u201d). His claim has a more\nlimited scope, as it pertains to the nature of causality in a world\nthat remains in existence only with the help of God. Although natural\nagents need God to exist, they can cause their effects without\nGod\u2019s direct participation in the causal process:\n\u201c[\u2026] many natural powers are sufficiently applied to\ntheir acts from their creation or generation, so that they need only\nthe presence of a suitable object\u201d (Summa II q. 116, p.\n340).\n\nOlivi explicitly rejects two competing views that give God a more\ncentral role in causal processes. According to one view, defended\nmainly by Dominicans, God contributes to the causal process\nindirectly, by applying created causes to their actions. The other\nview, favored by Franciscan authors such as John Duns Scotus and\nWilliam Ockham, God acts as a co-cause that brings about the effect\ntogether with the created cause (Schmutz 2001). Olivi claims that both\nof these have problematic consequences when they are applied to sinful\nactions of humans\u2014in particular to the original sin, which is\nthe explicit topic of question 116 of the second book of his\nSumma, where he develops his position. Unsurprisingly, he wants\nto keep God clear from all moral responsibility for our sins.\n\nThe position that God is not responsible for our sins was of course\nuncontroversial. None of the authors who defended the idea that God is\na concurrent cause (in one way or the other) thought that God thereby\nbecomes morally responsible for them. But what is philosophically\nimportant in Olivi\u2019s view is that he refuses to accept any other\nway to safeguard the impeccability of God except the denial of his\nrole as a concurrent cause in the free actions of our will. This view\nis closely related to his conception of the freedom of the will but he\nseems to extend the argument from the human will to created causes in\ngeneral; at least he uses physical causation as an example that\nilluminates the mutual roles of created causes and God:\n\n\nLikewise, the immediate effects of secondary causes are likenesses of\ntheir active powers, as a ray <of light> is a likeness of the\nlight of the sun, and the first effect of heat is nothing else than a\nlikeness of heat. If therefore the mentioned divine cooperation is of\ndifferent species than the heat, how can the likeness of heat be from\nit? (Summa II q. 116, p. 339)\n\n\nOlivi suggests here that God cannot bring about any effect in the\ncreated cause, which would help that cause to bring about its effect.\nThe only way God can take part in the causal process is by acting\ndirectly as a co-cause, and this won\u2019t do for reasons that Olivi\nlaid down earlier. The upshot is that God cannot be a concurrent cause\nin any way. The main purpose of the examples involving heat and light\nis to make the philosophical (and theological) point clear: Olivi\nappeals to created causes in general to make his point about sinful\nactions of the will more plausible. But he does this in such a way\nthat there seems to be little reason to doubt that he means to extend\nthe rejection of concurrence to created causes generally.\n2.1.4 Freedom of the will and personhood (personalitas)\n\nOlivi devotes several extended questions of his Summa to the\ntopic of human freedom, beginning with the question of whether human\nbeings even have free will (liberum arbitrium). Olivi\u2019s\nown argument for the affirmative begins by listing seven pairs of\nattitudes (affectus), each of which testifies to the existence\nof free will (Summa II q. 57, p. 317):\n\nZeal and mercy\nFriendship and hostility\nShame and glory\nGratitude and ingratitude\nSubjugation and domination\nHope and distrust\nCarefulness and heedlessness\n\n\nEach of these attitudes, Olivi claims, is intelligible only given the\nexistence of free will. More specifically, they are \u201cits\ndistinctive products, or its distinctive acts and habits\u201d\n(Summa II q. 57, p. 317). As he runs through the list,\nexplaining how each attitude entails free will, it becomes clear that\nmany of these claims are familiar ones. Zeal, for instance, is an\nangry reaction to bad deeds, motivated \u201conly against the bad\nthat one judges to have been done voluntarily, and thus which could\nhave been freely avoided\u201d (ibid., p. 318). Without free will,\nthis attitude is based on an assumption that is \u201cthoroughly\nfalse and grounded on a thoroughly false object\u201d (ibid., p.\n317). As zeal goes, so do the related phenomena of accusations,\nexcuses, blame, and guilt. Generally, \u201ca human being could no\nmore be accused of some vice than he could be accused of death, for he\ncould avoid the one as little as the other\u201d (ibid., p. 336).\nCarefulness and heedlessness, the last pair on the list, likewise\nbecome meaningless: \u201cFor it is foolish to be careful about\nthings that will occur necessarily\u201d (ibid., p. 323). It becomes\npointless to be careful about deliberation, for instance,\n\u201cbecause the deliberation itself will or will not happen\nnecessarily, and even one\u2019s carefulness will or will not occur\nnecessarily\u201d (ibid., p. 323).\n\nFor Olivi, these and other data stand as unshakeable evidence for the\nexistence and nature of free will. He makes this clear from the\nbeginning of his reply, when he introduces two premisses that\n\u201cno one of sane mind ought to doubt\u201d (Summa II q.\n57, p. 317). First, it is impossible for all of the attitudes of\none\u2019s rational nature to be \u201cthoroughly false and perverse\nand grounded on a thoroughly false and perverse object.\u201d Since\nOlivi thinks that the attitudes that distinguish us as rational\ncreatures are founded on free will, giving up on free will would be to\nabandon most of what makes us human. We would cease to be what we\nproperly are, persons, and we would become only \u201cintellectual\nbeasts\u201d (ibid., p. 338; see below). Second, it is impossible for\nattitudes to be entirely illusory when human beings improve and\nperfect themselves by assuming those attitudes (ibid., p. 317). If the\npractices of zeal, deliberation, friendship, love, political power,\netc. were all founded on a false assumption, then surely these\npractices would not be so crucial to human well-being. Thus \u201cno\none of sane mind will believe that something could be the truth which\nso sharply puts an end to all good things and brings on so many bad\nthings\u201d (ibid., p. 338). In the face of these implications, we\nshould reject whatever stands in the way of free will, whether that be\nthe authority of Aristotle or some abstruse principle of metaphysics.\n\u201cEven if there were no other argument establishing that [the\ndenial of free will] is false, this alone ought to be sufficiently\npersuasive\u201d (ibid., p. 338). Moreover, as he explicitly notes,\nwe should be persuaded not just of our own free will, but of the free\nwill of all human beings, since these arguments are based not on\nprivate experience, but on our relationships with others.\n\nHaving proved that human beings have free will, Olivi sets out to\nexplain what he means by freedom. His conception obviously belongs\nwithin the libertarian camp in the free will debate, and its central\nfeature is that in order to be free, the will must be active and\ncapable of reflexively moving itself to action. True, the will\u2019s\nchoices are not necessitated by reason or anything other than by the\nwill itself, but Olivi does not merely conclude that the will is not\nnecessitated; the further conclusion he reaches is that the will,\nuntil it makes a choice, is entirely undetermined one way or another,\nand that it determines itself in the direction it chooses. This is\nsomething \u201cevery human being senses with complete certainty\nwithin himself\u201d (Summa II q. 57, p. 327). In arguing that\nthe will determines itself, he means that it is a first mover, in need\nof no efficient cause other than itself. \u201cIts free power is the\ncause of its motion, when it is moved, and the cause of its rest, when\nit rests\u201d (ibid. ad 5, pp. 341\u201342; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2002).\nIf the will did not have this capacity for self-movement, then it\nwould have to be determined by something else, and so it would not be\nmaking its own choices. But this violates the unshakeable assumptions\nfrom which Olivi begins, because it would then turn out that the will\nis not autonomous and hence not a suitable object of one\u2019s zeal\nor friendship, among other things.\n\nOlivi is well aware that the lack of autonomy does not entirely\npreclude a sort of pseudo-zeal or pseudo-friendship. One might be\nangry with someone, for instance, not out of the conviction that the\nbad action was that person\u2019s fault, but simply in an effort to\nchange that person\u2019s ways. But this line of thought does\nviolence to our conceptions of ourselves and our fellow human beings.\nWe want people to do the right thing not because they have been\neffectively manipulated, but \u201csolely and purely because of the\nlove of justice\u201d (Summa II q. 57, ad 22, p. 368).\nFurther, when we urge a person to do the right thing, \u201cwe do not\nintend simply to move someone toward what is good, but rather to make\nit that he voluntarily moves himself toward the good\u201d (ibid., p.\n369).\n\nAnother distinctive feature of Olivi\u2019s theory of the freedom of\nthe will is that he criticizes Anselm of Canterbury\u2019s asymmetric\nnotion of freedom, according to which the will is free only when it\nconforms to the normative standard of justice. Olivi argues that the\nability to sin is a part of freedom and that the ability to\nchoose between alternatives\u2014including vices\u2014is part of the\ndefinition of freedom (Summa II q. 41, pp. 696\u2013702, q.\n57, 359; Kent 2017; Bobillier 2020, pp. 178\u201379). Moreover, Olivi\nargues fervently against the view that the will is a power for\nopposites only with respect to a future instant. In order to be truly\nfree, the will must, in the same instant it wills \u2018A\u2019, be\ncapable of willing \u2018not-A\u2019. Olivi\u2019s conception seems\nto have been the source of John Duns Scotus\u2019 revolutionary\ntheory of synchronic contingency (Dumont 1995), and although Scotus is\nbetter known as an early proponent of libertarian freedom, his view is\nheavily indebted to Olivi. Indeed, it is arguable that Olivi deserves\ncredit as the founder of this conception of freedom of the will.\n\nFinally, one of the original moves that Olivi makes with his theory of\nthe freedom of the will is that he proposes a novel interpretation of\nthe notion of \u2018personhood,\u2019 i.e. the property of being a\nperson (see Perler 2020; Piron 2007; Bobillier 2020, pp.\n102\u201337). This notion is put to several uses in different\ncontexts, but philosophically the most pertinent idea is that which he\ndevelops in relation to self-consciousness and the freedom of the\nwill: \u201cpersonhood is the same as per se existence, governing,\nfree, and reflexively turned (or turnable) to itself in a possessive\nway\u2014that is, possessing itself by a certain free\nreflextion\u201d (Summa II q. 52, p. 200). To be a person, one\nmust have two highly sophisticated abilities, namely a mind that\nprovides self-awareness by turning reflexively towards itself (see\nbelow) and freedom of the will understood in terms of activity and\nself-movement. Some elements of Olivi\u2019s innovative notion are\nmore well-known from authors of much later periods, such as Descartes,\nLocke and Kant; but it was Olivi who first formulated this notion of\npersonhood and used it in his metaphysical, epistemological and moral\ntheories (Bobillier 2020, pp. 133\u201334).\n2.2 Epistemology\n2.2.1 Rejection of divine illumination\n\nThe idea that certain knowledge requires divine illumination enjoyed\nsteady popularity from antiquity to late thirteenth century. The\nphilosophical appeal of the view is familiar from Plato\u2019s\nepistemology, and Augustine\u2019s remarks popularized it among early\nmedieval theologians. These remarks do not constitute a detailed\ntheory of how illumination takes place, but in the mid-thirteenth\ncentury prominent authors such as Bonaventure and Matthew of\nAquasparta developed a systematic defence of it. At the influence of\nAristotelian epistemological theory, the theory of divine illumination\ncame under pressure and it was both attacked and defended from many\nperspectives, e.g. by explaining illumination by separating the agent\nintellect from individual human beings and identifying it with God.\nOlivi was the first Franciscan author to launch a heavy critique of\nthe Augustinian idea that universal cognition requires divine\nillumination. He presents (in Summa I, q. 2) a thorough\ncriticism of the reasons that were used to defend it, and although he\nends up accepting the position, he emphasizes that the theory must be\ncarefully formulated so that it takes into account the shortcomings he\nhas pointed in it\u2014all of which can be taken to qualify it to the\nbrink of rejection (see the entry on\n divine illumination).\n After all, one of the conditions that he sets for the true theory is\nthat \u201cit does not take away the possibility of true and certain\njudgement and understanding\u201d (Summa I, q. 2, p. 510) from\nthe human mind, and in another context he argues that the acts of\nunderstanding originate in the human intellect (Summa II q. 74;\nCaldera 2010, pp. 235\u201336).\n\nAnother issue that leads Olivi to questions the idea of divine\nillumination is related to Henry of Ghent\u2019s realistic view\n(realistic of the Platonist breed), that knowledge of universal\npropositions provides a proof for the existence of God. In\nOlivi\u2019s eyes, the problem here is that if such knowledge is\nbased on grasping the eternal reasons in God (which God used in\ncreation), there is no way to preserve the theological doctrine that\nwe cannot see God in this life. While Henry\u2019s argument is based\non the realist idea that necessary truths would exists even in the\nabsence of thinking subjects, Olivi holds that necessary propositions\nare necessary only because they cannot be formed by a mind without\ntheir being true. Having thus undermined the fundamental basis of the\ntheory of divine illumination, Olivi goes on to propose a theory of\nknowledge that is closer to Aquinas\u2019 view in its appeal to\nempiricism, but that is more radical and preserves certain aspects of\nAugustine\u2019s neoplatonist theory\u2014especially as it\nemphasizes the active nature of the mind in cognitive processes (Piron\n2020b, par. 2\u20133).\n2.2.2 Direct realism\n\nOlivi\u2019s direct realism is central to his thinking about\ncognition. If he were willing to say that the object of our spiritual\nattention is not the external object but an internal species of the\nobject, then he could reformulate his theory of cognitive attention in\na more plausible way, as a matter of grasping an internal impression\nfrom the object. But Olivi works very hard to avoid falling into any\nkind of position that might be called representationalist\u2014that\nis, a view on which the immediate objects of cognition are internal.\nThis epistemological commitment to direct realism is one of the most\nimportant philosophical reasons for Olivi to reject the standard\nscholastic account of sensible and intelligible species. On that\nstandard account, species serve as forms that provide the intentional\ncontent of sensation and thought. Although these forms were standardly\ndescribed as merely the means by which we grasp external things, Olivi\nargued that in fact the proponent of species was committed to\nrepresentationalism.\n\nOlivi argues against the species theory by advancing through a series\nof ever-more-serious charges. First, the theory is committed to taking\nspecies as the objects of cognition:\n\n\nA species will never actually represent an object to the cognitive\npower unless the power attends to the species in such a way that it\nturns and fixes its attention on the species. But that to which the\npower\u2019s attention is turned has the character of an object, and\nthat to which it is first turned has the character of a first object.\nTherefore these species will have the character of an object more than\nthe character of an intermediate or representative source (Summa\nII q. 58 ad 14, p. 469; cf. Summa II q. 74, p. 123).\n\n\nHis argument for this conclusion turns on the first sentence of the\npassage, in which he claims that a species cannot represent an object\nto a cognizer unless the cognizer attends to the species. For Olivi,\nsuch attention to some thing is both a necessary and a sufficient\ncondition for that thing\u2019s being cognized. So if we do have to\nfocus our attention in this way on species, he infers that those\nspecies will be the object of cognition, not merely causal\nintermediaries.\n\nNext, Olivi argues that species would have to be the first object of\ncognition. To turn toward a species in the way that we must if that\nspecies is to represent the external world \u201cis the same as to\nattend to it as a first object\u201d (Summa II q. 74, p. 123).\nElsewhere, \u201cwe would always cognize the species before the thing\nitself that is the object\u201d (Summa II q. 58 ad 14, p.\n469). The point Olivi wants to make is one more often made by denying\nthat the world is seen directly or immediately. If we\nsee the external world at all, we see it only at second hand,\nindirectly.\n\nThe argument goes one final step. Someone who wants to claim that our\ninternal sensations are themselves perceived has to choose whether or\nnot to claim that the external world is also perceived. Olivi holds\nthat, on the species account, we would not perceive the external world\nat all, only images of it:\n\n\nThe attention will tend toward the species either in such a way that\nit would not pass beyond so as to attend to the object, or in such a\nway that it would pass beyond. If in the first way, then the thing\nwill not be seen in itself, but only its image will be seen as if it\nwere the thing itself (Summa II q. 74, p. 123; cf. q. 58 ad\n14, pp. 469\u201370, 487\u201388).\n\n\nThe argument is based on a dilemma. Granting that cognizers must\nattend to species, there either will or will not be a separate and\nfurther attention to the object itself. It would of course be quite\nodd to say that there is such a further attention. This would entail,\nas Olivi goes on to say, that one \u201cconsiders the object in two\nways\u2014first through a species, second in itself\u201d (Summa\nII q. 74, p. 123). This seems too much at odds with the phenomenal\nfeel of perception to be a serious possibility. The obvious way out of\nthe dilemma, then, is to say that there will not be any further\nattention: one apprehends the external world, if one does at all, in\nvirtue of attending to the species themselves. This is what the\nrepresentationalist will likely say. But if this were the case, Olivi\nargues, then we would be seeing only the images of objects, not the\nthings in themselves. Memorably, he remarks that a species\n\u201cwould veil the thing and impede its being attended to in itself\nas if present, rather than aid in its being attended to\u201d\n(Summa II q. 58 ad 14, p. 469; Pasnau 1997).\n\nIn place of the species theory, Olivi offers an interesting\nalternative. Rather than treat mental representations as something\nseparate from an act of cognition, Olivi proposes identifying the two.\nOn his view, an act of cognition in itself represents the object that\nis perceived. There is no need to postulate any further representation\nbeyond the act itself: that inevitably results in the mediation that\nOlivi wants to avoid. This act theory would prove influential on later\nscholastics, most notably William Ockham. And in our own era it has\nbeen reinvented and renamed, as the adverbial theory of thought and\nperception.\n2.3 Philosophy of Mind\n2.3.1 Soul and body\n\nWith the rediscovery of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysical and ethical\nworks, thirteenth-century theologians devoted an increasing portion of\ntheir time to interpreting and developing Aristotelian accounts of\nhuman nature. Olivi was very far from a slavish admirer of\nAristotle\u2019s, and his theory of the nature of the soul and its\nrelation to the body differs radically from those medieval\ninterpretations which endeavor to be faithful to the Philosopher.\nNonetheless, he employs the Aristotelian theoretical framework, and\nalthough he often seems to be rather hostile to Aristotle\u2019s\npervasive influence, once remarking that \u201cwithout reason he is\nbelieved, as the god of this age\u201d (Summa II q. 58 ad 14,\np. 482; see Burr 1971), the main thrust of his criticism is directed\nat contemporary Averroist interpretations of Aristotle rather than at\nAristotle himself (Piron 2006b). The critical, even harsh passages\nmust be understood in this light.\n\nNonetheless, he rejects many principles that are crucial for\nAristotle\u2019s account of the soul-body relationship. He argues\nthat it is \u201cnot only contrary to reason but also dangerous to\nthe faith\u201d to hold that \u201cthe [soul\u2019s] intellective\nand free part is the form of the body per se and considered as\nsuch\u201d (Summa II q. 51, p. 104). Others had questioned the\nextent to which soul and body could be analyzed in terms of form and\nmatter, but Olivi goes further because he explicitly denies that one\npart of the soul, the rational part, can be understood as the form of\nthe body. This denial is ultimately based on his view that the\nintellectual part of the soul must be spiritual and incorporeal\nbecause otherwise it cannot be immortal, intellectual, and free. Yet\nhe does not want to jeopardize the substantial unity of the soul and\nthe body, and he works towards a theory which incorporates both of\nthese doctrines.\n\nOlivi\u2019s denial that the soul\u2019s intellectual part is the\nform of the body matches fairly closely with a doctrine that was\ncondemned by the Council of Vienne in 1312, when Pope Clement V\ndeclared in the bull Fidei catholicae fundamento that it is a\nheresy to hold that \u201cthe rational or intellective soul is not\nper se and essentially the form of the human body\u201d (Denzinger\n1965, n. 902). However, it is easy to misunderstand what Olivi is\nsaying, and a closer analysis shows that his position is far more\nnuanced than the wording of the condemnation suggests. First, he is\nnot denying that the rational part of the soul is a form, or even that\nit is the form of a human being. To begin with, he follows Bonaventure\nand makes the distinction discussed above between two kinds of matter.\nThe human body and all material objects are made of corporeal matter,\nbut spiritual entities (angels and human souls) also have a material\nsubstratum, the so-called spiritual matter. Olivi argues that the\nrational part of the soul, intellect and will, is a form of this\nspiritual matter. It is acceptable to speak of intellect as the form\nof a human being since the spiritual matter belongs to the\nhuman being. But because the spiritual matter of the soul is distinct\nfrom the corporeal matter of the body, Olivi can maintain that the\nrational part is not the form of the body (see e.g. Summa\nII q. 51 appendix, p. 138).\n\nSecond, Olivi is not denying that the soul is the form of the\nbody. What he denies is that the rational part of the soul\n(\u201cthe intellective and free part\u201d) is the form of the\nbody. He resorts to a doctrine of the plurality of substantial forms,\naccording to which complex substances, such as human beings, have\nseveral more or less distinct forms that together make the complete\nhuman being. The intellectual part of the soul is distinct from\nanother part, the sensory part, and only the latter is the form of the\nbody. Because the two parts of the soul are united in the spiritual\nmatter, it is acceptable to say that the whole soul is the form of the\nbody:\n\n\nIt is said that the whole rational soul, rather than the sensory part,\nis the form of the body, even though it is informed by the whole only\ninsofar as it is informed by the soul\u2019s sensory and nutritive\npart. (Summa II q. 51 app., p. 146)\n\n\nWe should say that the whole soul is the form of the body, in much the\nsame way that we say that a person talks, not a tongue (ibid., p.\n144). But if we direct our attention to the various parts of the soul,\nthen it is wrong to say that the rational part, \u201cper se and\nconsidered as such,\u201d is the form of the body. The soul is the\nform of the body only with respect to its sensory and nutritive part.\nGiven Olivi\u2019s argumentation against the formal union between the\nintellectual part of the soul and the body, it may seem that the unity\nof the human being is compromised. Olivi argues, however, that the\nrelation between these two parts is substantial even though it is\nmediated by the sensory part and the spiritual matter of the soul. He\nwrites:\n\n\nIf the human body is united and inclined to the sensory form, which is\ninclined and united to the intellectual form; and the intellectual\nform is essentially united to the sensory form, which is inclined to\nthe body; then by the same token the intellectual form and the body\nare necessarily substantially united to each other. Still, this does\nnot mean that they would be united as form and matter. (Summa\nII q. 51, p. 134)\n\n\nThe substantial union between the intellectual and sensory parts is\ndue to their being the forms of the same spiritual matter of the soul.\nIn this way, all the metaphysical components constitute a single\nsubstance. A human being is an essentially unified entity even though\nthe intellectual part of the soul is not the actuality of the body or\nany of its parts.\n2.3.2 Cognitive activity and attention\n\nOne of the most interesting and original aspects of Olivi\u2019s\nphilosophy is his critique of the standard Aristotelian model of\ncognition. The starting point of this critique is the Augustinian\nconception of the ontological superiority of the soul with respect to\nthe body, which leads Olivi to insist that perception and intellectual\nunderstanding cannot be passive reception of external stimuli but must\nbe understood as active processes. On the conventional medieval view,\na cognitive power simply receives impressions from the world, in the\nform of sensible or intelligible species. Olivi argues that such an\naccount leaves out a crucial element, the focusing of the cognitive\npower\u2019s attention on the object to be cognized:\n\n\nHowever much the cognitive power is informed through a disposition and\na species differing from the cognitive action, it cannot advance to a\ncognitive action unless before this it actually tends toward the\nobject, so that the attention of its intention should be actually\nturned and directed to the object. (Summa II q. 72, p. 9)\n\n\nOlivi gives the kinds of examples that one would expect. The ears of\nsomeone sleeping, for instance, receive the same impressions as the\nears of someone awake, but the sleeper does not sense these\nimpressions. Even when we are awake, we sometimes do not perceive\nobjects right in front of us when we are intently focused on something\nelse (Summa II q. 73, pp. 89\u201390).\n\nOlivi argues that this kind of cognitive attention requires a\n\u201cvirtual extension\u201d toward the object. Though he accepts\nthe traditional theory of species in medio, sensible qualities\nthat fill the air between the senses and their objects (for details,\nsee Demange and Kedar 2020), he denies that these species are the\nefficient cause of cognition. One striking consequence of this claim\nis that the object itself need not exert any causal influence, not on\nthe cognitive powers nor even on the physical sense organs. The\nexternal object need only be close enough to be apprehended by the\ncognizer\u2019s spiritual attention. In the cases of both perception\nand understanding, the efficient agent is the cognitive power. The\nexternal object is merely a kind of final cause or, more precisely, a\n\u201cterminative cause\u201d (Summa II q. 72, p. 36;\nEpistola, n. 12). It is merely by being the object of the\ncognitive power\u2019s attention that the external object plays a\nrole in cognition.\n\nOlivi treats virtual attention\u2014or directedness\u2014not as a\nsui generis activity of the mind, but as a general kind of causal\nrelationship that can be applied to physical agents just as much as to\nmental ones. For him, every natural physical agent has a virtual\nattention of this sort that extends as far as its causal force does\n(Summa II q. 23, pp. 424\u201325). One authority comments that\nOlivi\u2019s virtual attention is \u201cin fact equivalent to action\nat a distance\u201d (Jansen 1921, p. 118), a characterization that\nseems apt in the case of physical effects such as the light of the sun\nthat illuminates distant objects.\n\nHowever, the case of cognitive acts is different. Olivi carefully\navoids committing to real extramission of vision, and he argues that\nperceptual acts take place in the powers of the soul, not in the\nperceived object (Summa II q. 58, p. 482; Silva & Toivanen\n2010). The virtual extension of the soul\u2019s attention is not\nreal, not even in some special nonphysical sense. When Olivi explains\nthat the extension is \u2018virtual\u2019, he means to contrast it\nwith \u2018real\u2019. He explicitly denies, for instance, that this\nvirtual extension involves \u201cany real emission of its\nessence\u201d (Summa II q. 73, p. 61). Elsewhere, considering\nthe claim that \u201cour mind is where it fixes its intention,\u201d\nhe says that \u201cthese words are metaphorical, for we are not there\nreally or substantially, but only virtually or intentionally\u201d\n(Summa II q. 37 ad 13, p. 672). On this basis it is fair to say\nthat the soul does not actually perform any action at a distance,\nalthough its attention can be directed to distant objects.\nAccordingly, Olivi\u2019s view is best described as an intentional\ntheory of cognition (Perler 2002; Toivanen 2013a).\n\nOlivi allows that the object itself, through species in medio,\ncan indirectly act on our spiritual faculties, through what he calls\nthe via colligantiae (way of connection). A flash of lightning\nwill make a physical impression on our eyes, and this physical\nimpression can, through the via colligantiae, affect the\nspiritual sensory powers. But, crucially, this connection is not what\nbrings about sensation. We see this flash, as opposed to\nreceiving merely a physical impression from it, when we direct our\nspiritual attention toward it (Quodlibet I.4). This via\ncolligantiae plays an important role across Olivi\u2019s\nphilosophical psychology, being his general method of explaining the\nvexed connection between mind and body (see Summa II q. 59, pp.\n546\u201354; ibid. q. 72, pp. 30\u201335; Jansen 1921, pp.\n76\u201390).\n2.3.3 Words and concepts\n\nOlivi extends his critique of species to the mental word\n(verbum), which was standardly postulated as the product of\nintellectual thought. His treatment of the verbum raises\ndifferent issues from those associated with species. Here the issue is\nnot direct realism, precisely, but rather the nature of concept\nformation. Near the start of his commentary on the Gospel of John,\nOlivi describes the standard view as follows: \u201cOur mental word\nis something following an act of thought [\u2026] and formed by that\nthought. [\u2026] After it has been formed [\u2026] the\n[extra-mental] object is clearly understood or viewed in that word as\nif in a mirror\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.1). This word,\nmoreover, \u201cis that which is first cognized by intellect and is\nits first object;\u201d the extra-mental object is cognized\nsecondarily. This description closely matches a characterization Olivi\ngives in his later Sentences commentary:\n\n\nSome maintain that a kind of concept, or word, is formed through an\nabstractive, investigative, or inventive consideration, in which real\nobjects are intellectively cognized as in a mirror. For they call this\nthe first thing understood, and the immediate object; it is a kind of\nintention, concept, and defining notion of things. (Summa II q.\n74, pp. 120\u201321)\n\n\nThis view has two characteristic features. First, it postulates a\nmental representation\u2014a concept or word\u2014that is the\nproduct of intellectual activity. Second, it supposes that we\nunderstand the world through these representations, in such a way that\nwe get at the world indirectly, or secondarily, \u201cas if in a\nmirror.\u201d Call this an object theory of the verbum.\n\nOlivi\u2019s own view is that the verbum should be identified\nwith a particular act of thought: \u201cour mental word is our actual\nthought\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.2.1). When we\nengage in abstract intellectual cognition, Olivi says, \u201cnothing\nserving as an object is really abstracted or formed that differs from\nthe act of consideration already mentioned\u201d (ibid., 6.2.3). His\nSumma offers a concise characterization:\n\n\nThis [sort of intervening concept] ought not to be called a\nverbum, nor can [such a concept] be anything other than the act\nof consideration itself or a memory species formed through that act.\n(Summa II q. 74, p. 121)\n\n\nThere are, then, acts of intellect, but there are no separate inner\nconcepts that are the objects of those acts. Call this an act theory\nof the verbum.\n\nWhy is this act theory superior to an object theory? One line of\nargument holds that the object theory \u201ccontains in itself\nobvious absurdities and thus contradicts sound reason\u201d\n(Tractatus de verbo 6.2.2). This claim is argued in\ndifferent ways, with the following dilemma often playing a crucial\nrole: On one hand the verbum is said to be the product of\nintellectual cognition. But on the other hand the verbum is\nsaid to be required for cognition as the \u201cfirst thing\nunderstood.\u201d How can it be both? Olivi thinks his opponents will\nhave to maintain that in some way the verbum is the product of\none act of intellect and the object of a second. This leads him to\nargue that his opponents are treating the verbum as merely a\nmemory. But Olivi is happy to countenance representations of this\nsort. Thus the object theory collapses into the act theory.\n\nThe second line of attack holds that the theory lacks support because\n\u201cthere is no necessity or utility in postulating such a\nverbum\u201d (Tractatus de verbo 6.2.3). Here Olivi\nconsiders two parallel lines of argument that a proponent of the\nmental word might make against this charge of superfluity.\n\n\nFirst, [\u2026] we experience in ourselves that we form in our mind\nnew concepts of many propositions and conclusions. These concepts\nremain in us later and we return to them when we want to remember such\npropositions. [\u2026] Second, [\u2026] from individuals seen or\nimagined by us we abstract and form defining characterizations of\ntheir universal features [\u2026] and we come back to these when we\nwish to view such universal features. (Tractatus de\nverbo 6.2.3)\n\n\nEach argument appeals to our experience of forming within ourselves\nabstract ideas: in the first case propositional ideas, in the second\nuniversals. Intellect in each case is said to form a verbum.\nOlivi replies that no such inner word is necessary. In each case we\nhave an act of conceptual thought, but no object is formed in\nintellect over and above the act of thinking itself. Indeed, if\nanything, such an object \u201cwould be an impediment\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014alluding to the epistemological difficulties discussed\nin the previous section.\n\nBy eliminating the representations that might intervene between\nintellect and external reality, Olivi gives us what we might be\ntempted to think of as a direct realist theory of intellectual\ncognition. Yet direct realism faces a serious problem at the\nintellectual level, a problem that Olivi\u2019s discussion fails to\nacknowledge. Direct realism is attractive as a theory of sensation\nbecause it seems clear what the objects of sensation are. But what are\nwe directly in touch with when our intellect thinks abstractly or\npropositionally? One answer to this question is Platonism: universals\nand/or propositions have some kind of abstract mode of existence,\nindependently of the human mind. Like almost all the scholastics,\nOlivi firmly rejects this kind of account (Summa II q. 13).\nAnother kind of answer, sometimes called conceptualism, treats\nuniversals and/or propositions as mental constructs. Defenders of the\nobject theory can take this approach. They can hold that although\nthere are no universals or propositions in external things (in\nre), there are universals and propositions in the mind (in\nmente). The verbum, serving as universal or as proposition,\nwill (in some cautiously described sense) be the object of\nthought.\n\nOlivi\u2019s act theory would seem to rule out this kind of\nconceptualism. But what then will Olivi put in its place? He speaks of\nintellect\u2019s \u201cattending to and considering the real\ncharacter of a common or specific nature\u201d (Tractatus de\nverbo 6.2.3; Pasnau 1999, 271\u2013276), as if he has an\nunproblematic account of intellect\u2019s relationship to the\nexternal world. Yet he says nothing to clarify the status of this\nrelationship. He simply does not seem to have recognized the problem\nof abstract knowledge as a fundamental metaphysical motivation for the\nobject theory. In this respect his overall account, although\nconceptually innovative, remains fundamentally incomplete.\n2.3.4 Self-Awareness and reflexivity\n\nOlivi extensively discusses various types of self-reflexivity in his\nwritings. He adopts the traditional idea that the intellect is capable\nof turning reflexively toward itself, but he also attributes certain\ntypes of reflexivity to the sensory powers of the soul and argues that\nthe will is a reflexive power.\n\nThe most rudimentary type of self-reflexivity takes place in the sense\nof touch. Aristotle argues in De anima II.11 that the organ of\nthe sense of touch is the heart and that the flesh of the body is\nnothing but the medium that transmits the sensations from an external\nobject to the heart. Olivi rejects the Aristotelian theory. He thinks\nthat the whole body functions as the organ of the sense of touch.\nMoreover, he argues that the body is the primary object of the sense\nof touch, while external objects are perceived secondarily by\nperceiving the harmful and beneficial changes that they cause in the\nbody. This position leads to the obvious problem that the sense of\ntouch seems to be a reflexive power, as it is capable of sensing the\nstate of its own organ. Olivi recognizes this problem and gives two\npossible solutions: either the sense of touch which is in one place of\nthe body senses the state of the adjacent part of the body, or the\nsense of touch really is capable of a certain type of reflexivity. In\nthe latter case, Olivi argues, the sense of touch would be capable of\nsensing the state of its own organ but not its own act or itself as a\npsychological power. He does not make up his mind between these two\nexplanations, but he clearly thinks that the sense of touch enables a\ncertain kind of bodily self-perception. Inasmuch as every animal has\nthe sense of touch, it follows that even the simplest animals are\ncapable of perceiving their bodies (Summa II q. 61, pp.\n575\u201385; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2008a; Toivanen 2013a).\n\nThe sense of touch is not the only sensory power that is capable of\nreflexivity. Another such power is the so-called common\nsense\u2014the highest cognitive power of the animal soul and the\nonly internal sense Olivi acknowledges. Although he does not provide a\nsystematic discussion of the reflexivity of the common sense, he\nsuggests in several places that it is capable of apprehending its own\nactivity by turning toward itself incompletely (semiplene)\n(Summa II q. 62, p. 595). This ability is related to the\nAristotelian conception of perception of perception, but Olivi\nsuggests something more than the traditional Aristotelian picture.\nFollowing Augustine, he argues that animals are aware of their own\nbodies and the purpose and value of their organs and body parts, since\notherwise they would not be able to use their bodies effectively and\npreserve their lives:\n\n\nWhen a dog or a snake sacrifices one of its members in order to save\nits head or sacrifices some part in order to save the whole, then it\nprefers the whole over the part and the head over the other member.\nTherefore, these animals must have some common power which shows both\nextremes simultaneously, their mutual comparison, and the preference\nof one over the other\u2014although it does not do this with the same\nfullness and degree of reflexive judgement as does the intellect.\n(Summa II q. 62, p. 588)\n\n\nThe common sense enables animals to perceive their own bodies, the\nparts and their functions, and the relative value of the parts for the\nwell-being of the animal as a whole, thus making animals capable of\nself-preservation that goes beyond the ability to avoid pain (see\nToivanen 2013b).\n\nThe difference between intellectual self-reflexivity and the\nreflexivity of the common sense is based on the spiritual nature of\nthe intellectual soul. Unlike the common sense, the intellectual mind\nis spiritual and immaterial and therefore capable of being directly\nand immediately aware of itself. Certain authors (most notably\nAquinas) had argued that this kind of direct awareness is not possible\nbecause considered in itself the intellect is fully potential. It must\nbe actualized by thinking something else before it can be cognized. By\ncontrast, Olivi argues that the soul is directly aware of itself.\n\n\nThe soul knows or is able to know itself in two ways. The first of\nthem is an experiential and as if tactile sensation by which the soul\nundoubtedly senses that it is, lives, cognizes, wills, sees, hears,\nmoves the body, and likewise for its other acts, whose principle and\nsubject it knows and senses itself to be. And this [happens] to such\nan extent that it cannot actually know or consider any object or any\nact without always knowing and sensing itself to be the subject\n(suppositum) of the act by which it knows and considers that\n[object or act] \u2026 The other way of knowing itself is by\nreasoning. In this way the soul investigates the genera and\ndifferences that it does not know in the first way. (Summa II\nq. 76, pp. 146\u201347)\n\n\nBy separating these two types of knowledge that the soul or mind has\nof itself, Olivi is in a position to explain why we do not have\ncertain knowledge of the nature of the soul. The direct awareness\ntells us only that the soul lives and acts, but in order to know the\nessence of the soul, we must compare this immediate awareness to our\nknowledge of the species and genera of the things in the world, and\nthis process is not infallible (Putallaz 1991; Brower-Toland\n2013).\n\nThe highest level of reflexivity, however, is found in the will,\nbecause only the will is capable of moving itself to action. In order\nto be free, the will has to be able to move itself in such a way that\nit can also refrain from moving itself. It has this ability because it\nis related to itself as a mover to a moved thing: \u201cInsofar as\nthe will is free, it has another kind of reflexivity upon itself which\nthe intellect lacks: for, the will is turned toward itself not only as\nto an object, but also as a mover to a moved thing\u201d (Summa\nII q. 51, p. 115). In fact, the reflexivity of the intellect is\nbased on the will\u2019s ability to direct other powers of the soul.\n(Summa II q. 57, pp. 364\u201366; ibid., q. 58, pp.\n421\u201323.) Usually human beings are able to control themselves by\ntheir will, and this ability is what makes them persons. Reflexivity\nof the will plays a crucial role in the process, as we can see from a\npassage in which Olivi explains how sleep affects the psychological\nprocesses of the soul:\n\n\nSometimes the attention of the superior part of the soul is in such a\nstate that it is able to invent and form various things with respect\nto the cognitive powers and, similarly, to refuse and approve with\nrespect to appetitive powers; then it is said to deliberate and\ncombine, to consent and choose. And nevertheless it does not move to\nthese acts freely, as it does when awake, because it moves itself to\nthese acts in such a way that it does not have a power to move itself\notherwise. (Summa II q. 59, p. 564)\n\n\nExperience shows that the will can act also when a person is asleep,\nas we often make choices in our dreams. But because the reflexivity of\nthe will is hindered, it does not make these choices freely. In this\nway, the ability to move the will to its acts is the crucial factor\nthat makes us free, and our personhood is dependent on the highest\ntype of reflexivity, which ensures that our choices and actions\noriginate in us.\n3. Practical Philosophy\n3.1 Ethics\n3.1.1 Virtue ethics\n\nLike most medieval authors, Olivi can be understood as a virtue\nethicist. As with many of them, however, he does not defend virtue\nethics in its strict Aristotelian guise. To begin with, he criticizes\nthe Thomistic position, according to which some moral virtues are in\nthe sensory part of the soul, but he is also critical of Bonaventure,\nwho held that virtues belong to the free choice (liberum\narbitrium) and thus include both the will and the intellect.\nInstead, Olivi places all virtues, including prudence, firmly in the\nwill. Other powers of the soul may participate in these virtues due to\ntheir connection to the will, but apart from this connection they have\nno real virtues (Kent 1995, 233\u201336; Summa III q. 4, pp.\n224\u201325, 231). Virtues, on Olivi\u2019s account, are stable\ndispositions (or habits, habitus) of the will, which are\ngenerated by repeated actions, and they make good choices easier for\nthe agent (Summa II q. 58, p. 432).\n\nMoreover, Olivi is careful to secure the freedom and autonomy of the\nwill even against its own dispositions: virtues and vices do not\ndetermine our choices. A virtuous person is more likely to make good\nchoices than a vicious one, but ultimately every choice is always up\nto the will (Bobiller 2020, 155\u201356), and the agent can always\nact against her virtuous or vicious dispositions. Olivi emphasizes\nthat this kind of freedom is a necessary condition for being morally\nresponsible of one\u2019s actions: \u201cWhere the freedom of the\nwill is missing, there is absolutely no ground for merit and\ndemerit\u201d (Summa II q. 57, 337). Another important aspect\nof Olivi\u2019s virtue ethics is that he plays down the role of\nexternal action and focuses instead on the will of the agent: the\nmoral value of our actions stems from the internal intention and the\nfree decision to perform those actions (see, e.g. Summa II q.\n113, p. 307; ibid., q. 118, p. 443; Normore 2004, p. 144).\n\nDue to the emphasis on the freedom of the will and the internal\nintention, the individual moral agent is at the center of\nOlivi\u2019s ethics. In particular, his notions of person and\npersonhood are ethically significant, as they comprise two properties\nthat make human beings moral agents: awareness of oneself as the\nsubject and origin of one\u2019s actions and choices, and freedom of\nthe will. The moral agent, for Olivi, is first and foremost a free\nperson, an autonomous individual, who is aware of her own actions as\nsomething that originates in her and who must judge the moral worth of\nher choices by herself (Bobillier 2020, 27\u2013137). In order to\nmake this judgement, the agent must be able to reflect her own (past,\npresent, future) choices against the objective normative order that is\nthe natural law/will of God, which they know via innate conscience and\n\u201cexperiential taste\u201d that explains the affective aspect of\nmoral knowledge (Bobillier 2020, 144\u201367; Summa II qq.\n81\u201382).\n\nOlivi\u2019s radical voluntarism leads him also to treat Aristotelian\nakrasia in a special way: literally as weakness of the\nwill that explains why the agent chooses agains his better\nknowledge. Genuine cases of akrasia (in which the person is not making\nan intellectual error, e.g., due to the influence of emotions) exist\nand they reveal the fundamental nature of the will, namely, that its\nfreedom is not bound by intellectual judgments or emotional outbursts\n(Kent 1984, 184\u2013205; Bobillier 2020, 239, 252\u201360). Olivi\nargues explicitly against the view he takes to be Aristotle\u2019s,\nnamely that the conclusion of the practical syllogism is action or\nnecessarily turns into action. He emphasizes that since the will is\nabsolutely free, the conclusion of the practical syllogism must be\naccepted by the will before it turns into action, and the will can\nalways reject the conclusion, thus leading the agent to reconsider the\nsituation at hand. Moreover, he thinks that when an akratic person\nchooses to perform a morally wrong action, he may be fully aware that\nit is against the moral law. In Olivi\u2019s view, human beings are\nable to consider one and the same action from many angles at the same\ntime; they can think simultaneously several universal premises and\ncombine them freely with the particular premise, thus reaching\ncontrary conclusions: this act of fornication is both morally\nblameworthy and pleasant, and I am free to choose whether I go\nfor it or not (Summa II qq. 85\u201386, 186\u201391; ibid.,\nq. 57, pp. 309\u201310; see Toivanen 2012).\n\nThus, an akratic person knows actually that what he is about to do is\na sin, but his knowledge is theoretical and lacks the experiential\naffective aspect. By contrast, he finds the sinful action pleasant\nbecause his thought concerning it has this aspect to it (Bobillier\n2020, 257\u201358; Summa II q. 86, p. 193). To be sure, even\nthis experiential mode of thinking does not determine the will, and\nthus an akratic can always decide to do otherwise, and he is fully\nresponsible for his choice. Olivi criticizes the Aristotelian theory\nfor taking away the responsibility due to a momentary lack of\nunderstanding, caused by emotion (see e.g. Bobillier 2020, pp.\n254\u201356). In the end, there is no other explanation for bad\nchoices except that the person wills to make them.\n\nOne central difference between Olivi\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\napproaches to virtue ethics is that while the latter thinks that a\nperson\u2019s moral character determines how he acts after the\npractical reasoning is done, Olivi argues that there always remains a\nchoice. Although one\u2019s moral character may statistically guide\nhim to choose a certain type of action, Olivi\u2019s focus is more on\nthe actual choice, which is in all cases completely free. Moral\neducation and habituation may improve one\u2019s ability to make\nmorally good choices, but ultimately moral improvement is a matter of\nsimply starting to do the right thing instead of wrong one. Thus,\nOlivi is a virtue ethicist but his virtue ethics is of a different\nbreed than Aristotle\u2019s.\n3.1.2 Unity of virtues\n\nOne question that late thirteenth-century authors discussed was\nrelated to the unity of the virtues. It was prompted by\nAugustine\u2019s critique of the Stoic position as well as by\nCicero\u2019s De officiis (Kent 1984, pp. 523\u201325), and\nit received a new impetus with Aristotle\u2019s argument that a\nvirtuous person necessarily has all virtues of character because\nprudence is necessary for each genuine virtue, and prudence in turn\nentails all other virtues (EN 6.12\u201313). The idea is\nroughly that a prudent person can grasp what is the best course of\naction all things considered, and this requires finding a\ncorrect balance that meets the requirements of all virtues: one who\nacts bravely must also act justly because unjust bravery is not a real\nvirtue.\n\nMany medieval philosophers accepted this view, but not all, and\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century critical voices were raised;\nOlivi seems to be one of the first to reject it completely. He thinks\nthat it is possible to have one virtue while lacking others, and his\nstrategy to ward off the Aristotelian theory is to argue that prudence\nitself is not one monolithic whole. Even if prudence turns out to be\nnecessary for every moral virtue, it is possible to possess only the\npart of prudence that is proper to one particular virtue:\n\n\n[\u2026] as moral virtue contains many virtues that differ from each\nother by their genera and species, so prudence contains many prudences\nor many partial dispositions. (Summa III q. 6, p. 277)\n\n\nIt is possible to, e.g., exercise moderation with respect to food and\ndrink and yet be covetous and amass money without limits, and the\nprudence that aids the agent to exercise moderation does not\nnecessarily convince him of the viciousness of covetousness. Virtues\nare essentially independent of each other. However, Olivi acknowledges\nthe unity of virtues in the sense that in order to become a fully\nvirtuous person, one must acquire all specific virtues. A virtuous\nagent functions as the unifying factor (Wood 1997, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nMoreover, Olivi thinks that virtues may support each other in\npractical life. In particular, he argues that voluntary poverty is not\nonly one of the virtues but actually the highest virtue (QPE q.\n8, p. 85). It is not suitable for everyone but only for those who are\nable to follow Franciscan ideals. However, for the latter it proves to\nbe essential as it leads to a host of other virtues such as chastity,\nfortitude, generosity, magnanimity\u2014and to humility, which Olivi\nconsiders as abandonment of oneself and submission to the will of God\n(Bobillier 2020, 193\u2013222). In contrast to humility, wrongly\ndirected self-love and pride are the sources of all vices (Bobillier\n2020, pp. 217\u201321, pp. 236\u201352).\n3.2 Political Philosophy\n3.2.1 Poverty\n\nAlthough Olivi did not leave behind systematic treatises on political\nphilosophy, his works touched upon several politically loaded\ntheological and philosophical ideas. In particular, he played a\ncentral role in the controversy over how rigorously to understand the\nFranciscan vow of poverty, which would have a lasting effect on\nmedieval political reality (Burr 1989, 2001). Although the controversy\ncentered on Franciscan poverty and was thus strongly motivated by\ntheological worries and Church politics, it is not difficult to see\nthat it has several philosophical dimensions to it. For instance, it\nhas been argued that the modern conception of subjective rights was\nfirst developed in the debate between the Franciscan order and the\npope over the correct interpretation of poverty and the vow (see,\ne.g., van Duffel 2010).\n\nFranciscans held that the vow of poverty requires renouncing ownership\n(dominium), but that using products owned by someone\nelse (e.g., the Church) does not violate the vow. However, the\nquestion that divided them in the latter half of the thirteenth\ncentury was whether the vow requires that, even when merely using the\ngoods of another, one adheres to strict standards of austerity, the\nso-called \u201cpoor use\u201d (usus pauper). Olivi insisted\non these strict standards but claimed that they are part of the vow\nonly indeterminately. This means first that not every violation is a\nmortal sin, provided that one\u2019s general tendency is to strive\nfor spiritual humility by living poorly. It also means that what\nexactly counts as poor use depends on the circumstances and situation,\nsince it is impossible to find a precise and fixed line between poor\nand lax use of commodities. In other words, Olivi admitted a certain\nlatitude and flexibility in this notion (Burr 2001, pp.\n51\u201353).\n\nAnother central idea for Olivi was that one should not obey\none\u2019s superiors if obeying their commands entails sinful action\nor the violation of the Franciscan vow, thus endangering one\u2019s\nsalvation. Given Olivi\u2019s flexible view of the scope of the poor\nuse, this last restriction makes the limit between the duties of\nobedience and disobedience vague. Each individual friar must judge in\nhis own conscience whether he should obey or disobey (and ultimately\nprotest) the commands of their superiors. It is not surprising that\nOlivi\u2019s theoretical model of the vow, in conjunction with the\npotential for disobedience, fueled the political controversy within\nthe Franciscan order and the Church (Burr 2001, pp. 64\u201365).\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, one of the most important aspects of\nOlivi\u2019s view is the connection between the freedom of the will\nand the evangelical vow\u2019s renunciation of ownership understood\nas dominion (dominium). The idea that ownership is a form of\ndominion stems from a more general theory according to which freedom\nof the will can be understood as a dominion that one has over\none\u2019s will. This dominion is extended to one\u2019s body and\nexternal actions, and ultimately to external goods. Olivi thinks that\nthe Franciscan vow means not only giving up the dominion over external\ngoods but also over one\u2019s own actions (obedience) and ultimately\none\u2019s own freedom, as it means subjection to the will of God.\nYet, when someone voluntarily subjects his will to God, he\nparadoxically proclaims his ultimate freedom: the vow must be\ncontinuously renewed. The choice to give up the freedom of the will is\na voluntary choice that is freely given every moment as long as one\nkeeps to the vow (QPE, q. 8, p. 169; QPE, q. 14, p.\n135; Piron 1996; Toivanen 2016a).\n3.2.2 The nature of political power\n\nOne of the most important texts where Olivi deals with political\nphilosophy is his Quid ponat ius (= Summa IV q. 1). His aim in\nthis text is to provide a theoretical foundation for his discussion on\nthe sacraments, and he considers it useful to start with a detailed\nanalysis of the ontology of political power and property rights.\nAlthough it has been pointed out that Olivi seems to prefer a mixed\nform of government (Blythe 1992, pp. 151\u201352), this particular\ntext does not aim at offering a political theory; it is a\nphilosophical exercise in social ontology, which centers on a question\nconcerning the ontological foundation of relational terms such as\n\u2018right\u2019 (ius), \u2018authority\u2019\n(auctoritas), \u2018power\u2019 (potestas),\n\u2018obligation\u2019 (obligatio), and \u2018property\nright\u2019 (proprietas). (For discussion, see Piron 1996,\n2016; Rode 2014, 2016; Toivanen 2016a.)\n\nOlivi develops his view in relation to two opposing views. According\nto the first view, there must be something real in the end-terms of\nthese relations because otherwise they would not be real: \u201ca\nrelation that posits nothing in the related things is only a relation\naccording to what is said (relatio secundum dici) [\u2026]\nbut it is clear that the power of a king, or any real jurisdiction, or\nobligation, or subordination of some people are really actual even\nwhen none of us thinks or talks about them\u201d (Summa IV q.\n1, par. 7). The second view holds that relational properties such as\ndominium are radically different from natural properties, and\nthat no ontological change takes place when, for instance, someone is\ncrowned a king. Olivi seeks for a position between these two views,\nand he finds one when he argues that relations of this kind are based\non rationes reales (see\n \u00a7 2.1).\n They are real relations in the sense that they do not depend on\nsomeone actually thinking of them but they do not entail any real\n(Aristotelian) ontological addition to the relata.\n\nThe relation that a ruler has to the subjects is a form of dominion,\nand it it principally related to the will of the ruler:\n\n\nTherefore, since this kind of power does not add anything intrinsic to\nthe person of the king, it can relate to the whole person of the king\nin such a way that it will not determinately relate to any of his\npowers, unless it perhaps relates to the free will (liberum\narbitrium) and the powers that are bound to it, insofar as they\nare such. (Summa IV q. 1, par. 53)\n\n\nCoronation extends the dominion of the king over his subjects, and\nthis is due to the human ability to change the normative reality by\nestablishing new relations between human beings, between human beings\nand property, and so forth (Rode 2014, pp. 377\u201378). Although the\nnormative reality ultimately depends on the will of God and natural\nlaw (Rode 2016, pp. 117\u201319), the human will plays an important\nrole in the detailed explanation of how it works.\n3.2.3 Economic theory\n\nIn addition to his philosophical and theological ambitions, Olivi took\npart in a theoretical discussion concerning economic justice. He\ncomposed a short treatise Tractatus de contractibus (ed. Piron\n2012) while he was working at the Franciscan studium generale\nof Narbonne in mid-1290s. The work is a theoretical treatise that is\nrelated to the moral dimension of economic activities and it was\nprobably occasioned by pastoral duties that Franciscan friars had in\nan urban context. Although Olivi\u2019s views can be traced back to\nearlier discussions on Roman and Canon law, as well as other works\ndealing with just price, scholars have also argued that his overall\napproach profoundly changed medieval economic theory (Kaye 1998, 2014;\nLangholm 1992, 1998; Piron 2012; Todeschini 2009; a more critical\nevaluation is Kirshner and Lo Prete 1984).\n\nIn De contractibus Olivi discusses several topics related to\nthe morality of economic activity, such as contracts, commerce, usury,\nvalue, and capital. The first question of the treatise serves as an\nillustrative example of his general approach to economics. It focuses\non the notion of just price, which Olivi analyzes with the intention\nof setting normative limits that regulate but do not completely\nprevent economic activity. As in Quid ponat ius, he proposes a\ntheory that reconciles two sets of opposing arguments. According to\nthe first set of arguments, a voluntary contract between a buyer and a\nseller suffices to establish a just price. The price the parties\nfreely agree upon is just, because any other way of setting the just\nprice would make commercial activities liable to immorality. Without\nfull knowledge of the just price, the buyer and the seller might\naccidentally deviate from it and thus sin. By contrast, the second set\nof arguments aims to prove that there must be objectively determinable\nlimits for the just price. Otherwise there might be a situation in\nwhich someone charges an extremely high price for a glass of water,\nand one who is dying of thirst pays it voluntarily, thereby making the\nprice just. Thus, all deviations from the objectively just price are\nagainst the principles of justice.\n\nOlivi treats just price in a similar way as usus pauper: it\ncannot be a pre-fixed and universally applicable single point but\nthere must be some amount of latitude and flexibility to it. He adopts\nthe Aristotelian idea of virtuous action as a middle-point between two\nopposing vices: just as virtue is not a fixed middle that can be known\na priori but depends on the context and situation, so just price has\nlimits but is open to variation due to various contextual factors.\n(Piron 2012, p. 45.) There are normative limits for the just\nprice\u2014for instance, vital needs may force the buyer to agree on\na price that is unjust, but the seller should refrain from asking more\nthan a fair price. Yet, the flexibility of the limits of just price\nleave room for economic activity and allow merchants to profit, and\nwithin these limits the participants agree on the price freely. Olivi\nalso submits that if neither party deceives the other and both enter\nthe transaction freely (no compelling circumstances obtain), one may\neven give away one\u2019s commodities for free.\n\nOlivi provides more detailed set of criteria for determining the\nlimits of just price in various situations in scholastic literature\n(Kaye 2014, p. 114). Among these criteria are the obvious quality of\nthe commodity, the materials and the amount of work needed to produce\nit, and rarity, but also individual desires and personal values (De\ncontractibus 1.1, pp. 98\u2013102; Toivanen 2016b). Further, he\nargues that the just price is affected by social factors such as\ncommon estimation and common needs, and that ultimately economic\nactivity exists for the sake of the common good of the community\n(Tractatus de contractibus 1.2, pp. 108\u201310). In this way,\nOlivi\u2019s analysis reflects the fact that medieval economic\ndiscourse was fundamentally normative and related to moral\ntheology\u2014unlike contemporary economics, which is more\ndescriptive and lacks the normative dimension (Piron 2012).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Translations", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<p>\nA comprehensive list of critical editions of Olivi\u2019s works has\nbeen published in K\u00f6nig-Pralong, Ribordy, and Suarez-Nani (eds.),\n2010, 463\u201371.
