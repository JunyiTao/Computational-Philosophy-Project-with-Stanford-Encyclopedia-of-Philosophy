    "main_text": "Ramist philosophy || The three laws of philosophy\n2.4 The three laws of philosophy\n\nRamus stressed that all arts should represent separate parts of\nnature. It would consequently be a serious mistake to confuse one art\nwith another. In the Posterior Analytics Aristotle had set\nout certain rules or laws for how a predicate should be related to a\nsubject in order to make a correct scientific proposition. Ramus took\nover these laws; but he applied them not only to propositions but also\nto the construction of entire arts.\n\nThe first law, the lex veritatis, or law of truth, stated\nthat every theorem in an art must be general and indispensable. For\nexample, a theorem stating that the angle of a triangle is a right\nangle would not be a false statement since there are indeed triangles\nwith right angles. But since it is not true in relation to all\ntriangles, such a theorem would violate the law of truth. A theorem\nwhich states that the sum of the degrees of the three angles of a\ntriangle is 180 would, however, be totally correct and generally\ntrue.\n\nThe second law was called the lex justitiae, or law of\njustice. Ramus regarded this as the most important of the three laws.\nIt ensured that justice was done to all the arts. No theorem belonging\nto one art should be allowed to trespass into the subject matter of\nanother, since that would be unjust. This law also demanded that all\nparts of an art should be homogeneous. It was on the basis of this law\nthat Ramus objected to Copernicus\u2019 planetary hypothesis (see\n \u00a71.4\n above). He held that Copernicus was not allowed to put forward\ntheories as to how the planets really moved in the heavens, which\nbelonged to the art astrophysics, while at the same time using\nmathematical hypotheses, which belonged to the art of mathematics. To\nRamus, this law was fundamental for the purpose of organizing a new\ncurriculum and was also, as we shall see, an important aspect of his\nmethod (Hooykaas 1958: 65).\n\nThe third law, the lex sapientiae, or law of wisdom, was the\nconcrete principle of how an art should be organized according to\ngeneral theorems. A more general theorem should always precede a less\ngeneral and more particular one. The theorem that an isosceles\ntriangle has angles which add up to a total of 180 degrees is quite\ncorrect; but since it is true for all triangles, it should precede\ntheorems applicable to specific kinds of triangle.\n\nThis way of treating philosophy as an aggregate of rigidly separated\narts may have had some pedagogical value, but it also raised\ndifficulties. Ramus, for instance, could not accept metaphysics as a\nseparate discipline, although in this case his nominalism was also in\noperation. By insisting that every art must have its correctly\nformulated theorems, organized from the more general to the more\nspecific, and that no theorem should be allowed to have reference to\nmore than one art, Ramus almost seems to impose a military discipline\non nature. Sometimes his followers defined philosophy as merely a\nmethodical collection of arts, a collectio methodica, which\nreveals even more clearly their understanding of the discipline.\n\nOn account of his idealistic belief in the correspondence between the\narts\u2014including their concepts and words\u2014and being, some\nscholars have assumed that Ramus was reliant on Platonism. In his\nearly writings he certainly assumed a clear metaphysical link between\nnature, mathematics and dialectic. Indeed, his contemporaries\nsometimes called him the Plato Gallicus, the French Plato;\nbut, in reality, the Platonic influences on him were rather vague and\noften concealed. Gradually, the Platonic ontological strains in his\nworks lost importance and faded away. Although he at times claimed to\nbe a Platonist, his references to Plato were mostly aimed at\ndistancing himself from Aristotle and, above all, from contemporary\nAristotelians. In practice, he was more often inspired by Cicero and\nby Stoicism than by Platonism. And despite his attacks on Aristotle,\nhe was essentially dependent on the scholastic tradition (cf.\nBruy\u00e8re 1984, who takes the opposite view on this issue).\n",
