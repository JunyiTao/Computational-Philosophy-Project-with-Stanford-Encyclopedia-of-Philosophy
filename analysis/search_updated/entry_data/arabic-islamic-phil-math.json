    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophy of pure mathematics deals with two major groups of\nquestions. One pertains to the ontology of mathematical entities and\nthe other to the epistemology of mathematical concepts and judgments\n(Avigad 2007). The nature and existence of mathematical objects (e.g.,\nnumbers and geometrical shapes), the existence and qualifications of\ninfinities (e.g., infinite magnitudes and infinite collections of\nnumbers or numbered things), and the existence and qualifications of\ncontinua are some of the most significant ontological issues with\nwhich philosophers of mathematics are concerned. On the other hand,\nsome of the most important and challenging epistemological issues\nabout mathematics are the following: the mechanisms through which we\ngrasp mathematical knowledge, the epistemic status of mathematical\naxioms and principles, the nature of mathematical proofs (that are\nwritable on paper) and their connection to what goes on in the mind of\nmathematicians, and the role of mathematical knowledge in attaining a\nbetter understanding of the physical world.\n\nIt is very well known that the medieval Islamic civilization played a\npivotal role in the historical development of technical aspects of\nmathematics. Standing on the shoulders of their pre-Islamic Greek,\nIndian, and Persian ancestors, Muslim mathematicians have made\nnumerous innovations in various branches of mathematics and have\nwritten a great number of books and essays introducing mathematical\nnotions and proving mathematical theorems (Al-Daffa\u02be 1977; R.\nRashed 1984b [1994]; 1996 [2012]; 2015; Berggren 2016). However, it is\nvery difficult (if not impossible) to find a book from the medieval\nIslamic era that is exclusively devoted to a comprehensive and\nsystematic study of philosophy of mathematics. Nevertheless, many of\nthe aforementioned philosophical issues about mathematics have been\naddressed, by great Muslim medieval thinkers, in various works whose\ncentral subject was mathematics, physics, metaphysics, or even\ntheology (kal\u0101m). Putting these scattered engagements\ntogether, it becomes clear that although philosophy of mathematics has\nnever been treated as an independent discipline in the medieval\nIslamic world, Muslim thinkers came up with very interesting and\nprofound ideas, insights, and arguments about at least some\nphilosophical issues related to mathematics. This entry briefly\nreviews the most remarkable examples of such insights and arguments,\nsome of which have been the subject of long-standing debates and\ndiscussions among Muslim thinkers. Accordingly, the technical\nmathematical works of Arab and Muslim scholars will be discussed only\nto the extent that they contain materials related to the\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Ontology of Mathematics\n1.1 What Mathematical Objects Are Not\n\nTraces of the philosophical views of Pythagoras and Plato regarding\nthe nature of mathematical objects can be found in the works of early\nMuslim thinkers. This could be partially due to the early Arabic\ntranslations of works by Pythagorean and Platonist mathematicians.\nMost of the mathematicians in the tradition of Nicomachus, Proclus,\nand Iamblichus were Pythagorean and Platonist (Endress 2003). Some of\ntheir most important works have been translated into Arabic and have\ninfluenced Muslim mathematicians and philosophers. For example,\nNicomachus\u2019s Introduction to Arithmetic was translated\ninto Arabic by \u1e24ab\u012bb Ibn Bahr\u012bz (d. early ninth\ncentury) from Syriac and by Th\u0101bit Ibn Qurra (d. 901) from Greek\n(Brentjes 2022: sec. 1). The inspiration of the Pythagorean and\nPlatonist approaches to the philosophy of mathematics is easily\ndetectable in, for example, the works of the Brethren of Purity\n(Ikhw\u0101n al-\u1e63af\u0101\u02be) and early Mutazilites\n(The Brethren of Purity [Epistles]; Endress 2003: 132\u201333;\nMarquet 2006; Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014: 2; El-Bizri 2018; Baffioni\n2022). The main characteristics of Pythagoreanism and Platonism\nregarding the ontology of mathematics can be captured by the following\ntheses (Zarepour 2019: 198):\n\n\nSeparateness of Mathematical Objects\n(SM): Mathematical objects are independent immaterial\nsubstances, fully separate (muf\u0101riq) from matter and\nmaterial objects.\nPrincipalness of Mathematical Objects\n(PM): Mathematical objects are the principles\n(mab\u0101di\u02be) of natural things. Mathematical objects\nhave some sort of primacy over natural forms which makes the latter\ndependent on (or grounded in or caused by) the former.\n\n\n\nPlato was committed to both of these theses. By contrast, the\nPythagoreans endorsed only the latter thesis. This is so at least if\nwe trust Aristotle\u2019s report (Metaphysics\n987b23\u2013987b25). Although Pythagoreanism considers numbers to be\nthe causes and principles of all other existing things, it does not\ntreat numbers as entities that are necessarily separate from matter\n(Zhmud 1989; De Smet 2022). From our perspective today, this is to\nsome extent surprising because, compared to\n (PM),\n (SM) seems to enjoy more prima facie plausibility. But\nprecisely because of the presence of strong tendencies towards\nPythagoreanism in early Islamic thought (Brentjes 2022), (PM) was more\nexplicitly defended than (SM). In any case, Avicenna\u2019s brutal\ncriticism of these two theses (along with his more general criticism\nof the Platonic theory of separate universal forms) made\nPythagoreanism and Platonism extremely unpopular in post-Avicennian\nphilosophy. In the Metaphysics of \u201cThe Healing\u201d,\nAvicenna (d. 937) argues against (SM) and (PM) not only by rejecting\narguments attributed to the defenders of these two theses (Avicenna\n[Mph]: chap. VII.2) but also by developing his own positive arguments\nagainst them (Avicenna [MPh]: chap. VII.3).\n\nAccording to an argument that Avicenna attributes to the defenders of\n (SM),\n on the one hand, mathematical objects are separate in definition (or\nin mind). They can be defined (or conceived) with no reference to\nmatter or material beings. On the other hand, everything that is\nseparate in definition (or in mind) is separate in existence.\nTherefore, the argument concludes, mathematical objects are separate\nin existence. They exist as fully separate beings which have no\nassociation with matter or material beings (Avicenna [MPh]: chap.\nVII.2, sec. 5). However, Avicenna finds this argument wanting. He\nargues that there is a difference between (a) defining (or conceiving)\nsomething without the condition of materiality and (b) defining (or\nconceiving) something with the condition of immateriality. He says\nthat mathematical objects are separate in definition only in the sense\nof (a). But the second premise of the argument under discussion is\ntrue only if the separation in definition is considered in the sense\nof (b). The mere fact that something can be defined without the\ncondition of materiality does not entail that that thing can exist in\nthe extramental realm fully separate from matter. But mathematical\nobjects cannot be defined with the condition of immateriality. It is\nnot plausible to suppose immateriality as an essential component of\nthe definitions of mathematical objects, or so Avicenna claims. Thus,\nthis argument is fallacious and cannot establish (SM) (Avicenna [MPh],\nchap. VII.2, secs. 16\u201317; Marmura 2006: 360\u201363; Porro\n2011: 292\u201393; Zarepour 2019: sec. 4.1).\n\nA simple argument that Avicenna attributes to the advocates of\n (PM)\n goes as follows: Mathematical objects are separate. In other words,\n (SM)\n is true. Moreover, the principles (or causes) of material things\ncannot be themselves material. They must be separate. Therefore,\nmathematical objects are the principles of material (or, natural)\nthings (Avicenna [MPh]: chap. VII.2, sec. 7). Avicenna thinks that\nthis argument is not only unsound due to the falsity of (SM) but also\ninvalid. Even if we accept both that mathematical objects are separate\nand that the principles of natural things must be separate, we cannot\nvalidly conclude that mathematical objects are the principles of\nnatural things. There might exist other separate non-mathematical\nthings which form the principles of natural beings. The argument in\nquestion is valid only if we presuppose that mathematical objects are\nthe only separate existents. But this is something for which we have\nno proof. Therefore, this argument fails to establish (PM) (Avicenna\n[MPh]: chap. VII.2, sec. 21; Marmura 2006: 365\u201366; Porro 2011:\n294; Zarepour 2019: sec. 4.2).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s own argument against the separateness or\nimmateriality of mathematical objects can be summarized as follows:\nThere are some mathematical objects in the sensible world. Otherwise,\nwe could not grasp their concepts (e.g., the concepts triangle,\ncircle, two, etc.) (Avicenna [MPh]: sec.\nVII.3, sec. 1). Now, if there are also some fully separate\nmathematical objects (entirely detached from the sensible world), then\nthese two groups of (sensible/non-separate and non-sensible/separate)\nmathematical objects must share similar essences and definitions\n(Avicenna [MPh]: chap. VII.3, sec. 2). Otherwise, there is no way we\ncan know separate material objects. This is because it does not seem\nthat we have any direct access to a realm of fully immaterial\nmathematical objects (This reminds us of Benacerraf\u2019s (1973)\nepistemological challenge to mathematical Platonism). Even if such\nthings exist, we know them only through the mediation of knowing their\nsensible counterparts. We have no justification for the existence of\nseparate mathematical objects which have no sensible counterpart in\nthe material world. But this leaves unjustified the claim that\nmathematical objects can essentially be immaterial and separate.\nAvicenna takes this argument as establishing that\n (SM)\n is implausible (Avicenna [MPh], chap. VII.3, sec. 3; Zarepour 2019:\nsec. 5). We will later see that this argument reveals interesting\naspects of Avicenna\u2019s accounts of the epistemology and ontology\nof mathematics.\n\nFinally, Avicenna argues that even if separate mathematical objects\nexist, they cannot be the principles (or causes) of natural things. It\nseems intuitively plausible that if a separate mathematical object is\nthe principle of any material existent, it must in the first place be\nthe principle of its own sensible counterpart. Note that, according to\nAvicenna, the claim that a separate mathematical object, say a\ntriangle, exists cannot be justified unless we have come to know it\nthrough knowing a sensible counterpart of it that exists in the\nmaterial world. Now if that separate triangle is the cause of any\nmaterial thing, it must in the first place be the principle of its own\nsensible counterpart, or so Avicenna believes. But if the sensible\ntriangle is caused by the separate triangle, then we can legitimately\nask why the former needs the latter. It is either the essence or (some\nof) the accidents of the sensible triangle that make it dependent on\nits separate counterpart. However, if it is due to the essence of the\nsensible triangle, then the separate triangle itself needs a\nprinciple. This is because the separate and the sensible triangles\nshare the same essence. Thus, if it is the essence of the sensible\ntriangle which makes it need the separate triangle, then the separate\ntriangle (having the same essence as its sensible counterpart) must\nitself be caused by another separate triangle. Repeating the same line\nof argument, we can conclude that there must exist an infinite chain\nof causally connected triangles. Since such infinite regresses are\nunacceptable, what makes a sensible mathematical object need its\nseparate counterpart is not their shared essence. But it is also\nimpossible that (some of) the accidents of a sensible mathematical\nobject make it dependent on its separate counterpart. The accidents of\nthe sensible object do not exist unless that object itself exists. But\nit is also assumed that the sensible object itself does not exist\nunless the separate object exists. This means that the separate object\nhas some sort of explanatory priority over the accidents of the\nsensible object. Therefore, the accidents of a sensible mathematical\nobject cannot explain, in a non-circular way, why this object needs\nits separate counterpart (Avicenna [MPh]: chap. VII.3, sec 4). Thus,\nit seems that there is no convincing justification for why a separate\nmathematical object must be the cause of its sensible counterpart, let\nalone the cause (or principle) of any other natural thing. Avicenna\ntakes this argument as refuting\n (PM).\n\nThese arguments show that mathematical objects are neither separate\nentities fully detached from the sensible world nor the causes of\nnatural things. Avicenna\u2019s refutation of Platonism and\nPythagoreanism regarding mathematical objects was so convincing and\ninfluential that these approaches almost completely disappeared in\npost-Avicennian philosophy. This was so despite the strong presence of\nPythagorean and/or Platonic elements in other (i.e., non-mathematical)\naspects of the philosophy of some post-Avicennian thinkers, like\nSuhraward\u012b (d. 1191) (Walbridge 2000; De Smet 2022). The details\nof some Avicennian criticisms of\n (SM)\n and\n (PM)\u2014which\n were usually taken as auxiliary parts of Avicenna\u2019s general\ncriticism of the Platonic account of universal forms\u2014were of\ncourse criticized by later philosophers (Arnzen 2011; Benevich 2019).\nThese criticisms did not revive mathematical Platonism and/or\nPythagoreanism in post-Avicennian Islamic philosophy. Having said\nthat, the discussions of the weakness and strength of the arguments\nfor and against mathematical Platonism continued to be of interest to\npost-Avicennian philosophers. Perhaps the most important work in which\nsuch arguments are collected is a book, entitled The Platonic\nIntelligible Forms, written between 1329 and 1339, by an unknown\nauthor (see the Arabic text of the book in Badaw\u012b 1947:\n1\u2013145, and its German translation in Arnzen 2011: Appendix\n1).\n1.2 What Mathematical Objects Are\n\nNow that we know what mathematical objects are not for Muslim\nphilosophers, we must thus ask what they are. In his\nMetaphysics (VI.1, 1026a13\u201319) Aristotle classifies\ndifferent theoretical sciences based on the ontological status of the\nobjects they study (Cleary 1994). Aristotle\u2019s main criteria for\ndistinguishing different sciences from each other are the extent and\nqualification of the association of the subject-matter of the sciences\nwith movement and materiality. Employing a similar approach, in his\nThe Aims of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Maq\u0101la\nf\u012b aghr\u0101\u1e0d kit\u0101b m\u0101 ba\u02bfd\nal-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfa), al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 950)\nargues that the subject matters of mathematics\u2014i.e.,\nmathematical objects\u2014are abstracted (mujarrad) from\nmatter in estimation (wahm) but not in the extramental world.\nOn the one hand, mathematical objects are different from the objects\nthat metaphysics studies because the latter objects are fully detached\nfrom matter both in estimation and in the extramental world. On the\nother hand, mathematical objects are different from the sensible\nphysical objects because they cannot be separated from matter, either\nin estimation or in the extramental world. Thus, mathematics occupies\nan intermediate position between metaphysics and physics. The\nassociation of mathematical objects with matter is stronger than that\nof the objects of metaphysics but weaker than that of the objects of\nphysics. (The original Arabic of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s book\ncan be found in al-F\u0101r\u0101bi 1890: 34\u201338, and Kiankhah\n2015: 147\u201357. For two English translations, see Bertolacci 2006:\n66\u201372, and McGinnis & Reisman 2007: 78\u201381.)\n\nIn his Enumeration of the Sciences\n(\u02beI\u1e25\u1e63\u0101\u02be al-\u02bful\u016bm),\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b puts forward a more detailed discussion of\nthe ontology of mathematics. He distinguishes applied/practical\n(\u02bfamal\u012b) mathematics from pure/theoretical\n(na\u1e93ar\u012b) mathematics. The objects of applied\narithmetic are numbers as they are associated with sensible things.\nApplied arithmetic considers the number of sensible things existing in\nthe material world. By contrast, pure arithmetic considers an absolute\nconception of number and plurality. It studies numbers that are\nabstracted from all the numbered things in the sensible world.\nSimilarly, applied geometry considers the geometrical properties of\nspecific physical objects, whereas pure geometry deals with\ngeometrical shapes regardless of whether or not they are attached to\nspecific physical objects (al-F\u0101r\u0101bi [Enum]: chap. 3;\nEndress 2003: 139\u201340).\n\nFollowing the main line of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s approach,\nAvicenna develops a more detailed discussion of the division of the\nsciences (Marmura 1980; Gutas 2003) according to which mathematical\nobjects exist in the extramental world in association with determinate\nspecies of matter (e.g., wood, gold, etc.). Through the function of\nthe faculty of estimation, mathematical objects can be abstracted in\nthe mind from the specific species of matter they are attached to in\nthe extramental world. Nevertheless, they must still be conceived as\nmaterial things. In other words, mathematical objects in the mind are\nseparate from determinate species of matter, though not from\nmateriality itself (Avicenna [MPh]: chap. I.2; Di Vincenzo 2021:\n20\u201327). Avicenna argues that numbers (a\u02bfd\u0101d)\nand magnitudes (maq\u0101d\u012br)\u2014as the most general\nrepresentatives of the objects of arithmetic and geometry,\nrespectively\u2014are accidents (a\u02bfr\u0101\u1e0d) and\nproperties of physical objects existing in the sensible world\n(Avicenna [MPh]: chap. III.3\u20134). Neither numbers nor magnitudes\nhave independent immaterial subsistence in the extramental world.\nMagnitudes (or geometrical shapes, to be more specific) cannot be\ndetached from materiality even in the mind (Avicenna [MPh]: chap.\nIII.4 sec.2 and VII.2, sec. 21). By contrast, numbers can be\nconsidered fully separate from matter and materiality. Nevertheless,\nsuch a consideration of numbers is metaphysical, rather than\nmathematical (Endress 2003: 142; Zarepour 2016: sec. 4). Numbers,\ninasmuch as they are subject to mathematical studies, must be\nreceptive to decrease and increase. Therefore, even in the mind, they\nmust be conceived as properties of material things (Avicenna [MPh]:\nchap. I.3, secs. 17\u201319). In sum, mathematical objects exist in\nthe extramental world as the properties of physical things constituted\nof determinate species of matter. Mathematical objects can be\nabstracted from these determinate species of matter in the mind. But\nthey must still be thought of as properties of material things.\nOtherwise, they cannot be the subject of mathematical studies.\nAvicenna\u2019s discussion of the roles of the faculty of estimation\nand the process of abstraction in mathematical studies has been\ninterpreted in two different ways. Some scholars (McGinnis 2006; 2017;\nArdeshir 2008; Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014; Tahiri 2016; 2018) think that\nmathematical objects are in the first place mental objects, and\nabstraction is a mechanism for constructing mathematical objects.\nAttributing a literalist view to Avicenna, some others (Marmura 1980;\n2005; Zarepour 2016; 2021; McGinnis 2019) argue that mathematical\nobjects literally exist in the physical world and abstraction is a\ncognitive process for grasping mathematical concepts, rather than\nproducing mathematical objects. These different interpretations remind\nus of the contrast between the literalist (Mueller 1970; 1990) and the\nabstractionist (Lear 1982; Hussey 1991) readings of Aristotle\u2019s\nontology of mathematics. The most obvious objection to the literalist\nview is that, unlike physical objects, which are inexact and\nimperfect, mathematical objects seem to be perfect and exact (or\nidealized). For instance, it seems that there exists no perfectly\ncircular physical object whose circumference is not (at least to a\nmodest extent) serrated. To rebut this objection against the\nliteralist reading of Avicenna\u2019s ontology of mathematics, it has\nbeen argued that he endorses the existence of perfect mathematical\nobjects in the physical world (Zarepour 2016: sec. 5; 2021: sec.\n4).\n\nThis is probably due to the emphasis of Avicenna and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b on the role of estimation (wahm) in\nconceiving mathematical objects that, in post-Avicennian philosophy,\nmathematics is often referred to as an estimative (wahm\u012b\nor mawh\u016bm) science (Pines 1974). Before or contemporary\nwith Avicenna, many Muslim thinkers had emphasized that mathematical\nobjects exist, in one way or another, in the physical world. For\ninstance, in The Book of Instruction (Kit\u0101b\nal-tafh\u012bm ([Instr]), al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b (d. ~1048)\ndefends an account of the nature of mathematical objects which seems\nto have strong affinities with the literalist reading of Avicenna\n(Samian 2011; 2014). In the same vein, Ibn al-Haytham (d. 1040), in\nthe first pages of his Resolution of Doubts (\u1e24all\nshuk\u016bk, [Doubts]), argues that geometrical objects exist in\nthe sensible world. They can be abstracted from matter through the\nactivity of the faculty of imagination (takhayyul), whose\nfunction in Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s theory of mind is very similar to\nthe function of estimation in Avicenna\u2019s psychology. However, by\ncontrast with Avicenna and Aristotle (De anima\n428a5\u201318), Ibn al-Haytham thinks that imagined forms, that are\nabstracted from physical objects, have a more real existence. For him,\nthe real (\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b) existence of mathematical\nobjects is instantiated in imagination and distinction\n(tamy\u012bz)\u2014another cognitive faculty in Ibn\nal-Haytham\u2019s philosophy of mind, which plays a crucial role in\ngrasping universal concepts through the mediation of imagined forms.\n(See Ighbariah & Wagner 2018: secs. 79\u201381. R. Rashed [1993:\n2:8\u201319] believes that there were two different Muslim thinkers\nnamed \u2018Ibn al-Haytham\u2019. Sabra [1998; 2003] rejects\nRashed\u2019s view and here I follow Sabra\u2019s position.)\n\nIn post-Avicennian philosophy, the claim that mathematical objects are\nmental (or estimative or imaginative) became the most popular view and\nwas increasingly emphasized by different thinkers. The inclination\ntowards this approach was partially due to powerful criticisms of\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the ontology of mathematics. For instance,\nSuhraward\u012b offered strong objections to the existence of numbers\nin the physical world as accidents of sensible things. Consider a\ngroup of four individuals. Avicenna thinks that four-ness\n(\u02bearba\u02bf\u012bya) is an accident of these four\npersons. But Suhraward\u012b finds it untenable. He argues that\n\n\neither \u2018four-ness\u2019 must be complete in each one of the\nindividuals, which is not the case, or else there must be something of\nfour-ness in each one, which can only be the unity. Therefore, either\nthe totality of four-ness must have no locus other than the intellect,\nor else neither four-ness nor anything of four-ness can be in each\none. On this latter supposition, too, four-ness is only in the\nintellect. (Suhraward\u012b The Philosophy of Illumination\n[1999: 48])\n\n\nHe believes that it is only our mind which can impose a unity to a\nplurality of four distinct sensible entities. There is nothing in the\nextramental world which can naturally bind four detached things in\nsuch a way that they collectively accept the accident of four-ness.\nThus, for Suhraward\u012b numbers (and mathematical objects in\ngeneral) are only mind-dependent (i\u02bftib\u0101r\u012b)\nthings (Ziai 1990: 108; Walbridge 2000: 63 and 78\u201379). A similar\nline of argument is developed by Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 (d.\n1640). He accepts that there are pluralities in the extramental world.\nBut he insists that it is only through the activity of our mind that a\ngroup of distinct objects can be considered a unity. There is nothing\nin the extramental world which bestows unity to an arbitrary group of\ndistinct objects (Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, Al-Shaw\u0101hid\nal-rub\u016bb\u012bya, [1982: 65]). This line of argument against\nthe consideration of numbers as properties of physical objects reminds\nus of Frege\u2019s criticism of this idea (Frege 1884: \u00a7\u00a7\n21\u201325).\n\nA turning point in the rendition of mathematical objects as mental\nobjects is to appeal to the notion of nafs al-\u02beamr to\ndescribe the ontological status of mathematical objects and to clarify\nthe nature of the truth-makers of mathematical propositions. The\nphrase \u2018nafs al-\u02beamr\u2019 literally means\nthe thing itself. But its technical content is hard to\ncapture in translation. Although this phrase also appears in\nAvicenna\u2019s writings, it is probably Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (d. 1274) who used the phrase for the first\ntime in a technical and theory-laden sense. Different philosophers\nhave understood this phrase as referring to different things including\ndivine knowledge, the Active Intellect, the realm of ideas, etc.\n(Ka\u015f 2021; Spiker 2021). The significance of the theory of\nnafs al-\u02beamr for the philosophy of mathematics is that\nit may enable us to preserve judgment-realism even without\nobject-realism. Some philosophers (e.g., Sayyid al-Shar\u012bf\nal-Jurj\u0101n\u012b, d. 1413) have used this theory to show that\nalthough mathematical objects are merely estimative\n(wahm\u012b) and have no mind-independent existence,\nmathematical judgments are certain (yaq\u012bn\u012b), and\ntheir truth-values are mind-independent. In other words, regarding\nmathematics, judgment-realism can still be defended even when\nobject-realism is rejected (Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014; Hasan 2017).\n\nAnother important issue pertinent to the ontology of mathematics is\nthe nature of algebraic objects. An algebraic unknown (or, an\nalgebraic variable, as we call it today) can indifferently refer to\neither a number or a geometrical magnitude. So, the nature of an\nalgebraic object is not the same as either numbers or geometrical\nshapes. Unfortunately, the hybrid ontology of this special type of\nmathematical objects has rarely (if at all) been discussed as an\nontology different from those of numbers and magnitudes. But it has\nbeen argued that the familiarity of philosophers such as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Avicenna with the algebraic theory put\nforward by al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (d. 850) in his Kit\u0101b\nal-jabr wa al-muq\u0101bala inspired them to develop a general\nontology of things (ashy\u0101\u02be) that is neither\nPlatonic nor Aristotelian (R. Rashed 1984a; 2008; 2015: 716\u201318;\n2018).\n1.3 Infinity\n\nThe problem of infinity is one of the philosophical topics relating to\nmathematics that was most extensively discussed in medieval Islamic\nphilosophy. There are many treatises which argue that no number can be\ninfinite. For instance, in response to a series of questions raised by\nAb\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 \u02bf\u012as\u0101 Ibn Usayyid, Th\u0101bit\nIbn Qurra discusses the nature of numbers and argues that there is no\ninfinite number. Moreover, he shows that the infinite sets of numbers\ncan be of different sizes (Pines 1968; Sabra 1997; Mancosu 2009: sec.\n2; M. Rashed 2009; Zarepour 2020b: sec. 4.2). Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn\n\u02bfAd\u012b (d. 974), in his Treatise on the Infinite\n(Maqala f\u012b ghayr al-mutan\u0101h\u012b), provides a\ndifferent set of arguments to establish that infinity is not\npredicable upon numbers (McGinnis 2010: sec. 3). But the following\nthree arguments for finitism are probably the most discussed in the\nIslamic tradition:\n\n(1) The Collimation Argument (burh\u0101n\nal-mus\u0101mita): Consider the line \\(L\\) which\nbegins from the center \\(O\\) of a circle \\(C\\),\nintersects the circumference of \\(C\\),\nand extends infinitely. Suppose, moreover, that\nthere is a distinct line \\(L'\\) that is parallel to \\(L\\)\nand infinitely extended in both directions. Now\nsuppose that \\(L\\) starts to rotate around \\(O\\)\nand gets closer to \\(L'\\), while \\(L'\\) is motionless\nand fixed. As a result, \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\) intersect. So,\nthere is a time at which the two lines are parallel and there is a\ntime at which they are intersected. Therefore, there must be a moment\nof time \\(T\\) and a point \\(P\\) on\n\\(L'\\) at which the two lines intersect each other for the first time,\nor so the argument goes. But obviously there are no such \\(T\\)\nand \\(P\\). For every \\(T\\)\nin which \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\) are\nintersected, we can find an earlier moment of time \\(T'\\) (i.e.,\n\\(T' < T\\)) in which the two lines were\nalready intersected. So, it seems that we have a contradiction. On the\none hand, there must be a first moment of intersection (or such is the\nexpectation of the defenders of the argument). On the other hand,\nthere cannot be such a moment. Therefore, the initial assumption of\nthe argument\u2014that is the existence of infinite lines\u2014must\nbe rejected. There is no infinite one-dimensional magnitude and,\nconsequently, no infinite magnitudes in general.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nA variation of the above scenario\u2014that likely originated from\nAristotle\u2019s De Caelo (I.5, 272a8\u201320)\u2014was\nproposed by Ab\u016b Sahl al-Q\u016bh\u012b (d. 1000) to reject the\nAristotelian dogma that an infinite distance cannot be traversed in a\nfinite time. This is because the above argument shows that \\(L\\)\ncan traverse \\(L'\\) in a finite period of time equal\nto half the time of the rotation of \\(L\\) around O\nfor one round (R. Rashed 1999; McGinnis 2010: sec. 3). By\ncontrast, Avicenna employs the Collimation Argument in certain places\n(Avicenna Al-Naj\u0101t [1985: 233\u201344]; [Ph1]: chap.\nII.8, [8]) to reject the possibility of circular motion in an infinite\nvoid and in other places (Avicenna \u02bfUy\u016bn\nal-\u1e25ikma, chap. 3, 20) to reject the actual infinitude of\nmagnitudes (Zarepour 2020b: sec. 3.1; R. Rashed 2016: 302\u20136;\n2018: sec. 11.2). The Collimation Argument is criticized by, among\nothers, Ab\u016b al-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (d. 1165) in\nhis Al-Mu\u02bftabar (vol. 2, 83\u201384 and 86),\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b in his Talkh\u012b\u1e63\nal-Mu\u1e25assal ([1985: 217]), and al-\u1e24ill\u012b (d.\n1325) in his Nih\u0101ya al-mar\u0101m f\u012b \u02bfilm\nal-kal\u0101m (vol. 1, 256\u2013258). The argument is also\ndefended by, among others, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (d.\n1209) in his Al-Mab\u0101\u1e25ith al-mashriq\u012bya (vol.\n1, 196) and Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 in his Asf\u0101r\n(vol. 4, 21\u201323).\n\n(2) The Ladder Argument (burh\u0101n al-sullam): If\ninfinite lines can exist, then there can be an acute angle whose sides\nare infinite. Suppose that \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) are two infinite lines\nwhich intersect at \\(A\\) and make such an acute angle.\n\\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) extend infinitely in the directions of \\(B\\)\nand \\(C\\), respectively. Now consider\nparallel lines \\(B_{i} C_{i}\\) (for integers \\(i \u22651\\)) which\nintersects \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) so that the distance between every two\nconsecutive lines is equal to the distance of \\(B_{1} C_{1}\\) from \\(A\\).\nThus, each line is longer than the previous line by\na fixed length, say \\(d\\) (i.e., for every integer\n\\(i\u22651,\\) \\(B_{i+1} C_{i+1} - B_{i}C_{i} = d\\)). Now consider\n\\(BC\\). It is farther than any \\(B_{i}C_{i}\\) from \\(A\\).\nThus, \\(BC\\) is longer than any \\(B_{i}C_{i}.\\) This\nindicates that \\(BC\\) must be actually infinite. However, \\(BC\\) is\nconfined between two lines (i.e., \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\)). It terminates at\n\\(B\\) and \\(C\\). Therefore, it must be\nfinite as well. Accordingly, \\(BC\\) must be both finite and infinite.\nThis is impossible. So, the initial assumption we build the argument\nupon is false. No infinite line (and, a fortiori, no infinite\nmagnitude) can exist (R. Rashed 2016; 2018: sec. 11.2; Zarepour 2020b:\nsec. 3.2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe Ladder Argument is a rehabilitation of an Aristotelian argument\npresented in De Caelo (I.5, 271b26\u2013272a7). Avicenna\ndiscusses this argument in the Physics of \u201cThe\nHealing\u201d (Avicenna [Ph2]: chap. III.8, [7]). The argument\nhas been the subject of a long-standing debate in post-Avicennian\nphilosophy (McGinnis 2018). The argument was criticized by, among\nothers, Ab\u016b al-Barak\u0101t in his Al-Mu\u02bftabar\n(vol. 2, 84\u201386) and Najm al-D\u012bn al-K\u0101tib\u012b\nal-Qazw\u012bn\u012b (d. 1277) in his \u1e24ikma\nal-\u02bfayn ([2002: 38\u201339]). On the other hand, defenses\nof the Ladder Argument can be found in, among others,\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\u2019s commentary on Avicenna\u2019s\nPointers and Reminders (in Avicenna [Pointers]: nama\u1e6d\nI, 183\u2013191) and Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s commentary\non al-Abhar\u012b\u2019s Hid\u0101ya (Shar\u1e25\nAl-Hid\u0101ya al-Ath\u012br\u012bya, 65\u201369).\n\n(3) The Mapping Argument (burh\u0101n\nal-ta\u1e6d\u0101buq or al-ta\u1e6db\u012bq): Consider an\nactually infinite line \\(AC\\) which starts from \\(A\\)\nand extends infinitely in the direction of \\(C\\).\nRemove a finite segment \\(AB\\) from the beginning of \\(AC\\). Suppose\nthat \\(B^{*}C^{*}\\) is a copy of (and, accordingly, of the same length\nas) \\(BC\\). Compare the size of \\(B^{*}C^{*}\\) with \\(AC\\) by mapping\nthe former upon the latter so that the two lines are parallel and\n\\(B^{*}\\) is right in front of \\(A\\). \\(B^{*}C^{*}\\)\nmust extend infinitely in the direction of \\(C^{*}\\). Otherwise,\n\\(B^{*}C^{*}\\) would be finite. This means that \\(BC\\) would be finite\ntoo. As a result, \\(AC\\)\u2014which is the sum of \\(BC\\) with the\nfinite segment \\(AB\\)\u2014would be finite. Since this contradicts\nthe initial assumption that \\(AC\\) is actually infinite,\n\\(B^{*}C^{*}\\) must extend infinitely in the direction of \\(C^{*}\\).\nBut if so, then \\(B^{*}C^{*}\\) and \\(AC\\) correspond to each other, in\nthe sense that no part of one of them remains uncovered by the other.\nSo, based on the fourth common notion of the first book of\nEuclid\u2019s Elements\u2014according to which things which\ncorrespond to one another are equal to one another ([1908: vol. 1,\n155])\u2014we can conclude that \\(AC\\) is equal to \\(B^{*}C^{*}\\).\nThis indicates that \\(AC\\) would also be equal to \\(BC\\), which is a\nproper part of \\(AB\\). However, the fifth Euclidean common notion\nstates that such a whole-part equality is absurd ([1908: vol. 1,\n155]). Therefore, \\(AC\\) cannot be equal to \\(BC\\). Consequently, the\ninitial assumption that \\(AC\\) can be an actually infinite line must\nbe rejected. There can be no such actually infinite magnitude.\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nEarlier versions of the Mapping Argument can be found in different\nplaces of al-Kind\u012b\u2019s oeuvre (Rescher & Khatchadourian\n1965; Shamsi 1975; Adamson 2007: chap. 4; Zarepour 2020b: n. 52). More\nprecise versions of this argument are presented by Avicenna (Marmura\n1960; McGinnis 2010: sec. 4; Zarepour 2020b). The strength and\naccuracy of the versions of the argument these thinkers provide\ndepend, partially at least, on the precision of their construal of the\nnotion of equality of geometric magnitudes. It has been shown that\nsome of Muslim thinkers have pretty detailed accounts of this notion\n(R. Rashed 2019).\n\nLike the other two arguments, the primary goal of the Mapping Argument\nis to show that no infinite continuous magnitude actually exists.\nHaving read Euclid\u2019s Elements (bks 7\u20139), Muslim\nthinkers knew that numbers could be easily represented by magnitudes.\nTherefore, any argument for the impossibility of infinite magnitudes\ncan be taken as an argument against the infinity of numbers. But how\nabout infinite collections? None of the three arguments is directly\napplicable to infinite collections of discrete entities. Nevertheless,\nit has been argued that Avicenna was likely aware that the Mapping\nArgument could be modified so that it is applicable to infinite\ncollections of discrete numbered things (Zarepour 2020b: sec. 4). The\nsizes of two collections of discrete entities can be compared by\nemploying the very notion of \u2018mapping\u2019 that we previously\nused in the case of continuous magnitudes. However, in the case of the\ncollections of discrete entities, this notion must be cashed out in\nterms of one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two\ncollections in question. Two collections of discrete entities\ncorrespond to each other if every member of one collection can be\npaired with one (and only one) member of the other so that no member\nof any of these collections remains unpaired. Avicenna seems to have\nbeen aware that an infinite collection of discrete entities can be put\nin one-to-one correspondence with some of its proper subcollections.\nAnd he finds this as absurd as the correspondence of an infinite\nmagnitude with its proper submagnitude. He explicitly mentions that\nthe Mapping Argument can rule out the possibilities of both infinite\nmagnitudes and infinite collections of discrete entities (e.g.,\nnumbers and numbered things). However, he does not himself make it\nexplicit how this argument actually works in the case of discrete\nthings. He does not provide any concrete example of the application of\nthe Mapping Argument to the case of the infinite collections of\nobjects. Such an example can be found in the works of post-Avicennian\nphilosophers like Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (Shar\u1e25\n\u02bfUyun al-\u1e25ikma, al-\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bf\u012by\u0101t\n[1994: 53]). Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111) has mentioned the Mapping\nArgument in his Maq\u0101\u1e63id ([2000: 97\u201398]) and\nthe earliest transmission of this argument to the Latin tradition is\nprobably through the Latin translation of Maq\u0101\u1e63id\nin the third quarter of the twelfth century.\n\nThese arguments are usually discussed in the context of physics. This\nis because they are devised in the first place to show that no\ninfinite can actually exist in the physical world. But if, endorsing\nliteralism, we consider mathematical objects as properties of physical\nobjects, then the impossibility of the existence of actual infinites\nin the physical world implies the impossibility of infinitely extended\ngeometric lines and infinite sets of numbers. But those who reject\nliteralism about the ontology of mathematics have different views\nregarding the applicability of such arguments to mathematical objects.\nFor instance, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b believes that the\nMapping Argument cannot reject the infinitude of the collection of\nnatural numbers because he renders mathematical objects as\nmind-dependent and fully immaterial entities (Shar\u1e25\n\u02bfUyun al-\u1e25ikma, al-\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bf\u012by\u0101t\n[1994: 53\u201357]). Although we can appeal to the Mapping Argument\nto reject the existence of an infinite collection of distinct physical\nobjects in the extramental world, this argument cannot reject the\nexistence of an infinite number of mind-dependent objects like\nnumbers, or so al-R\u0101z\u012b seems to believe (Zarepour 2020b:\n4.1).\n\nInterestingly, some Muslim philosophers have argued that even the mind\nhas its own limitations in terms of perceiving infinite things. For\ninstance, Ibn al-Haytham believes that although we can imagine finite\nlines of any arbitrary length (i.e., regardless of how long they are),\nwe cannot imagine an actually infinite line. Accordingly, although we\ncan imagine a finite line longer than the size of the universe, we\ncannot conceive an actually infinite line. Ibn al-Haytham contends\nthat actual infinities do not exist either in the extramental world or\neven in the mind (Masoumi Hamedani 2013; Ighbariah & Wagner 2018:\n80).\n1.4 Continuity\n\nThe views of Muslim thinkers regarding mathematical continuum are\nintertwined with the position they uphold in the debate between\natomism and hylomorphism about the nature of the physical world. For\nAvicenna there is no gap between the physical world and the realm of\nmathematical objects. This is so at least if we accept interpretations\nof Avicenna as a literalist regarding the ontology of mathematics. He\nbelieves that geometrical magnitudes are continuous in the sense that\nthey have no actual part. Correspondingly, physical dimensions are\ncontinuous and have no actual parts. We can of course divide any\ncontinuous magnitude into smaller parts. In the physical world, there\nis a practical lower limit for the length of the physical dimensions\nwhich can in practice be broken down into smaller magnitudes. By\ncontrast, in our faculty of estimation, this limit disappears, and all\nmagnitudes are potentially infinitely divisible. Despite this\npractical difference, theoretically speaking, there is no difference\nbetween the structure of geometrical lines and physical dimensions. As\na result, geometrical continuity implies that physical atomism is\nfalse. Indeed, Avicenna appeals to mathematical continuity to reject\nphysical atomism (Avicenna [Ph2]: chap. III.3\u20135; Lettinck 1999;\nDhanani 2015; McGinnis 2019: sec. 3).\n\nIn contrast with Avicenna, there are philosophers who endorse\nmathematical continuity and physical atomism simultaneously. For\ninstance, Shahrast\u0101n\u012b (d. 1153) insists that the judgment of\nthe faculty of estimation is not reliable enough to convince us that\nthe physical magnitudes can bear potentially infinite divisions. He\nbelieves that physical magnitudes are not infinitely divisible. The\nnumber of their parts, either actual or even potential, is finite.\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b reminds us that although the size of the\nuniverse is imaginable to be infinite, philosophers usually reject\nthat the universe is infinite. Relying on a similar approach,\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b contends that although every magnitude is\nimaginable as infinitely divisible, there are strong arguments which\nshow that the faculty of estimation is mistaken in this case and no\nphysical magnitudes are infinitely divisible. Infinite extendibility\nof the size of the universe in the estimation is compatible with the\nuniverse being finite. Similarly, infinite divisibility of magnitudes\nin the estimation could be compatible with their having only a finite\nnumber of (potential) parts in the extramental world, or so\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b seems to believe (al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b\nSumma philosophiae, 513; McGinnis 2019). This means that if\nwe take mathematical objects as merely estimative constructions, then\nwe can reconcile purely mathematical continuity with physical\natomism.\n\nProposing a subtle modification, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\n(Al-Man\u1e6diq, vol. 6, chapter 6, 63) argues against\nDemocritus that everything that is divisible in imagination is\ndivisible in the extramental world. He believes that there is a lower\nlimit to the length of divisible magnitudes that we can imagine. It is\nnot true that every magnitude, no matter how small, is divisible in\nthe estimation. He does not reject that in Euclidean geometry\nmagnitudes are infinitely divisible. But he seems not to accept that\nit is possible to make a visual image (through the faculty of\nestimation) of every magnitude we can talk about in the context of\nEuclidean geometry. Embracing physical atomism (in his later works),\nal-R\u0101z\u012b denies that continuous Euclidean geometry can\nrepresent the real structure of the extramental world (Setia 2006;\nEftekhari 2018; 2019). The claim that continuity has no reality other\nthan in the faculty of estimation is often restated in the works of\nthe later atomists like \u02bfA\u1e0d\u016bd al-D\u012bn\nal-\u02be\u012aj\u012b (d. 1355) (Hasan 2017: 233\u201335).\n2. Epistemology of Mathematics\n2.1 Grasping Mathematical Concepts\n\nMost Muslim thinkers who have talked about the epistemology of\nmathematical concepts believe that these concepts are formed through\nsome cognitive mechanisms whose first input is the data we receive\nthrough our external senses. The details of such mechanisms are\nspelled out in different ways by different philosophers, depending on\ntheir general picture of human cognitive psychology. For instance,\nAvicenna puts forward a thought experiment showing that no\nmathematical concepts can be grasped in the absence of sense\nperception (Avicenna [MPh], chap. VII.3, sec. 1; Zarepour 2019: sec.\n5; 2021, sec. 3). This indicates that Avicenna endorses some sort of\nconcept empiricism about mathematics. On the literalist interpretation\nof Avicenna\u2019s ontology of mathematics, mathematical objects\nexist in the sensible world as non-sensible connotational attributes\n(ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) of physical objects. Like all other\nconnotational attributes, mathematical entities are perceived by the\nfaculty of estimation. For instance, it is the faculty of estimation\nwhich perceives two-ness when we see two books. In such an experience,\nthe sensible data collected by the external senses would be\ntransferred to the faculty of estimation through the mediation of the\nfaculty of common sense (\u1e25iss mushtarak). Estimation\nenables us to overlook all other characteristics of the experience we\nhave had and to perceive two-ness that is not directly accessible to\nour external senses.\n\nEven on the literalist account of the ontology of mathematics, there\nare still many mathematical entities with which mathematicians might\nengage but which do not exist in the extramental world (e.g., a\ncomplex and extraordinary geometrical shape with no counterpart in the\nsensible world). Avicenna believes that the faculty of imagination\n(mutakhayyila) can construct mental images of such objects by\nanalyzing, synthesizing, separating, and combining the images of\nsimpler items that have previously been perceived by and stored in our\ncognitive faculties (Zarepour 2021: sec. 3). But if we endorse the\nabstractionist construal of Avicenna\u2019s ontology of mathematics,\nthen all mathematical objects are mental constructions. There\nexists no mathematical object in the extramental world which could\ndirectly be perceived by the estimation. On this interpretation, the\nfaculty of estimation cooperates with the faculty of imagination to\nproduce idealized objects, none of which has a counterpart outside our\nminds. It is the mental acts conducted by these faculties which enable\nus to construct geometric shapes and numbers (Ardeshir 2008; Tahiri\n2016; 2018).\n\nIn any case, since estimation is a bodily faculty, it cannot engage\nwith fully immaterial things. So, it perceives mathematical entities\nas things associated with matter (though not with specific species of\nit). The objects of estimation are not intelligible universal\nconcepts. So, the cognitive process of grasping mathematical concepts\nmust be completed by adding the Active Intellect to our story\n(Zarepour 2021). On one reading of Avicenna\u2019s epistemology\n(Nuseibeh 1989; Davidson 1992: chap. 4; Goodman 1992 [2006]; Black\n2014), the act of the faculty of estimation prepares our soul to\nreceive the universal concepts that will be emanated by the\nActive Intellect. On another account of Avicenna\u2019s epistemology\n(Hasse 2001; Gutas 2012), the Active Intellect is merely a reservoir\nof intelligible concepts to which we find access because of the\npreparatory and ineliminable function of the internal faculties. In\nsum, the acquisition of mathematical concepts is a process that begins\nwith sense perception and ends with the function of the Active\nIntellect. And between these two stages, the operation of the internal\nfaculties in general and the faculties of estimation and imagination\nin particular is necessary and inescapable.\n\nVery similar, though much less sophisticated, pictures of the\nprocedure of grasping mathematical concepts are presented in the works\nof Avicenna\u2019s contemporary scientists. For example, Ibn\nal-Haytham talks about only two faculties: imagination\n(takhayyula) and distinction (tamy\u012bz).\nImagination is the faculty which constructs idealized mathematical\nobjects according to the impressions that are left to us through our\nsense perceptions. For instance, imagination enables us to abstract\ngeometrical magnitudes from the sensible bodies we see in the external\nworld. However, the transition from the images of mathematical objects\nto mathematical concepts is something that must be carried out by the\nfaculty of distinction. This faculty plays a twofold role. On the one\nhand, it contributes to analyzing, synthesizing, separating, and\ncombining previously perceived (or produced images). This role is\nassigned to mutakhayyila in Avicenna\u2019s psychology. On\nthe other hand, the faculty of distinction is a replacement of the\nActive Intellect. In Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s philosophy, the final step\nof the conceptualization is carried out by the faculty of distinction.\nIt has been argued that the Active Intellect and the divine light do\nnot play any significant role in Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s theory of\nknowledge (Ighbariah & Wagner 2018).\n\nDeveloping an account more or less similar to that of Avicenna,\nal-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b accepts that some mathematical entities like\nlines and points exist in the physical world but they cannot be\ngrasped by our external senses. Nevertheless, the data we receive\nthrough our sense experiences enable us to perceive these objects\nand/or to produce idealized constructions that do not exist in the\nextramental world (Samian 2011). However, he does not seem to have a\nclear picture of cognitive psychology in which the roles of different\nfaculties are explicitly distinguished. That is why he wavers between\ntwo pictures, in one of which estimation (wahm) is the first\nfaculty to apprehend mathematical objects, while in the other, this\nrole must be played by intellect (\u02bfaql). On the latter\nview, nothing below the level of the intellect can perceive\nmathematical objects. Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b\u2019s hesitation\nbetween the two rival views becomes more apparent especially when we\naccept that both the Persian and Arabic versions of Kit\u0101b\nal-tafh\u012bm are written by himself. For instance, in the\nArabic version, he claims that points cannot be conceived by any\nfaculty other than the intellect (al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b [Astro]:\n3). By contrast, in the Persian version, he attributes this role to\nestimation (al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b [Instr]: 7). He does not seem to\nconsider any clear boundary between the intelligible\n(ma\u02bfq\u016bl) and the estimative\n(mawh\u016bm).\n\nIn the context of the theories of nafs al-\u02beamr proposed\nby later Muslim thinkers, external senses, estimation, and intellect\nall cooperate with each other to give us a conception of mathematical\nentities as they are in nafs al-\u02beamr. However, the\nprocess through which we can have access to and know about the realm\nof nafs al-\u02beamr is by no means less mysterious than the\nrole of the Active Intellect in Avicenna\u2019s philosophy.\n2.2 Epistemological States of the Principles of Mathematics\n\nEvery proposition is an ordered structure constituted from concepts.\nBut to know a proposition, it does not suffice just to know its\nconceptual components. We also need to take some further steps.\nFollowing Aristotle and Euclid, most (if not all) Muslim philosophers\nbelieve in foundationalist/axiomatic accounts of epistemology,\naccording to which all instances of knowledge are eventually built\nupon the foundations (mab\u0101di\u2019) of basic concepts\nand propositions which can be known directly and immediately.\nNon-basic concepts and propositions can be derived from basic ones by\ndefinitions (ta\u02bf\u0101r\u012bf or\n\u1e25ud\u016bd) and syllogisms\n(qiy\u0101s\u0101t), respectively. This means that after\nacquiring the conceptual components of a proposition P we\nstill need to take the following three steps:\n\nordering and combining the acquired concepts to form\nP as a structured unity,\nassenting to the truth (ta\u1e63d\u012bq) of\nfoundational propositions, and\nestablishing the truth of P with some\nsyllogisms from the foundational propositions.\n\n\nFor Avicenna, the faculty of imagination plays crucial roles in steps\n(1) and (3). Imagination enables us to arrive at meaningful\npropositions by exploring our storage of previously grasped concepts\nand combining them to make various ordered structures of concepts (and\nto examine whether or not they form a meaningful proposition).\nMoreover, imagination enables us to consider combinations of\npropositions in order to find the suitable (series of consecutive)\nsyllogism(s) which can lead us to the desired proposition. The most\ncrucial part of this process is to find suitable middle terms for the\nsyllogisms which can lead us to the desired conclusion. In\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy, the faculty of imagination undertakes\nthis search operation. An immediate question regarding this view is\nhow imagination, as a bodily faculty, can entertain universal concepts\nthat are supposed to be fully immaterial intelligible entities.\nVarious possible answers to this question are investigated by, among\nothers, Gutas (2001), Adamson (2004), and Black (2013). In Ibn\nal-Haytham\u2019s philosophy, this is the faculty of distinction that\nplays the central role regarding (1) and (3). (More on (3) will be\nsaid in the next section).\n\nThings get more complicated when we turn to\n (2).\n Following the ancient Greek tradition, Muslim philosophers categorize\nthe foundational principles of the demonstrative sciences into three\ngroups: common notions/axioms (al-u\u1e63\u016bl\nal-muta\u02bf\u0101rafa), hypotheses (al-u\u1e63\u016bl\nal-maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bfa), and postulates\n(mu\u1e63\u0101dar\u0101t). Roughly speaking, common notions\nare the most obvious propositions that we can know\u2014the first\nprinciples that we grasp. Hypotheses and postulates are not as obvious\nas axioms. They in principle need to be proved. These two groups of\nprinciples are usually distinguished based on the epistemic attitude\nof the student who is learning them. Hypotheses are the foundational\nprinciples that seem plausible to the student even though she has no\nproof for them. By contrast, postulates seem dubious to the student,\nin the sense that she might have some feelings and ideas against the\nplausibility of these principles. The most often repeated example of\npostulates in the works of medieval Muslim thinkers is probably the\nparallel postulate of Euclidean geometry. This classification is\ndefended by, among others, al-Nayr\u012bz\u012b (d. 922; in Besthorn\n& Heiberg 1893: 14\u201326), al-F\u0101r\u0101bi\n(Al-Man\u1e6diq, chaps. 87\u201390), Avicenna\n(al-Burh\u0101n, chap. I.12), and al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\n(As\u0101s al-\u02beiqtib\u0101s, chap. V.1.15).\n\nSince mathematical hypotheses and postulates must eventually be proved\nbased on previously known propositions, it seems that the epistemic\nstatus of mathematical propositions depends, in the end, on how we\ngrasp the most obvious of these principles. In other words, it seems\nthat all mathematical propositions can be derived from axioms through\nthe fully a priori (= sense-experience-independent) mechanism\nof demonstrative syllogism.\n\nMuslim thinkers have no consensus regarding the epistemic status of\nthe principles of mathematics and the cognitive mechanisms through\nwhich we assent to the truth of these principles. For example, it can\nbe shown that, according to Avicenna, every basic proposition of\nmathematics is included in either awwal\u012by\u0101t\n(primary data) or fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t (or, more\ncompletely, muqaddam\u0101t fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t\nal-qiy\u0101s, which is translated to \u2018data with built-in\nsyllogisms\u2019 by Gutas (2012)). \u2018The whole is greater than\nthe part\u2019 and \u2018four is even\u2019 are two of the most\nfamous examples, respectively, of awwal\u012by\u0101t and\nfi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t. According to Avicenna,\nawwal\u012by\u0101t have no middle terms and, therefore, no\nsyllogism can be made to demonstrate them. They are too basic and\nobvious to need a proof (or to be provable at all). As soon as we\ngrasp all the concepts from which an awwal\u012b proposition\nis constituted, we immediately assent to the truth of that\nproposition. These propositions are self-evident and necessary. No one\ncan have a rational doubt about them. Unlike\nawwal\u012by\u0101t, fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t have\nmiddle terms and must be proved. However, the syllogism through which\na fi\u1e6dr\u012b proposition must be established is so\nsimple that as soon as the minor term (i.e., subject) and the major\nterm (i.e., predicate) are grasped, the middle term appears in the\nmind and the truth of that proposition is assented to. For example,\nimmediately after grasping the concepts four\nand even, the concept divisible-by-two\nappears in our mind and we can\naffirm the fact that \u2018(every) four is even\u2019 through the\nfollowing syllogism (Mousavian & Ardeshir 2018):\n\n\n(Every) four is divisible by two.\n\n(Every) divisible by two is even.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\n(Every) four is even.\n\n\nThe truths of both awwal\u012by\u0101t and\nfi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t are assented to through the natural\noperation (fi\u1e6dra) of the intellect. So, after grasping\nthe conceptual components of them, we can grasp these propositions\nwithout appealing to the data we receive from our sense experiences.\nThese propositions are constituted from non-a priori\nconcepts. But after we grasp the conceptual components of them, these\npropositions can be justified through a priori mechanisms. We\nshould be cautious, however, that a priority does not entail\ninnateness in the sense of being given at birth. Avicenna rejects that\nwe possess any instance of propositional knowledge at birth. (For\ndifferent views regarding the epistemic status of the Avicennian\nawwal\u012by\u0101t and fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t,\nsee Zarepour 2020a; 2020c; Gutas 2020.)\n\nMore or less similar accounts of the basic propositions of mathematics\ncan be found in philosophers like al-F\u0101r\u0101bi and\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. However, both some of Avicenna\u2019s\ncontemporaries and some post-Avicennian thinkers took a more empirical\nand/or more skeptical approach to the truth of mathematical\npropositions. For example, in his first commentary on Euclid\u2019s\nElements, Shar\u1e25 mus\u1ea1\u0304dar\u0101t,\nIbn al-Haytham follows the mainstream view that basic propositions of\nmathematics are self-evident, necessary, and rationally indubitable.\nBut, in his second commentary, \u1e24all shuk\u016bk\n([Doubts]), he endorses a more empirical position and argues that we\nacquire these instances of knowledge by facing frequent use of them in\ndaily life. Consider, for example, the common notion \u2018things\nwhich correspond with one another are equal to one another\u2019. Ibn\nal-Haytham says that we accept this proposition because we have\nrepeatedly seen that when a body is mapped or superposed upon another\nbody and the lengths of them do not exceed each other, our intellect\n(\u02bfaql) judges that these bodies (or, more precisely,\ntheir lengths) are equal. Without having such experiences, we could\nnot come to assent to the truth of this axiom. Therefore, our\nknowledge of such axioms is somewhat sense-experience-dependent (Ibn\nal-Haytham [Doubts]: 31; R. Rashed 2019).\n\nIn his Optics (Sabra 1989), Ibn al-Haytham puts forward an\ninteresting treatment of the principle \u2018the whole is greater\nthan the part\u2019, which has striking similarities with\nAvicenna\u2019s treatment of fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t. He\nargues that this principle can be proved through the following\nargument:\n\n\nThe whole exceeds the part.\n\nEverything which exceeds something else is greater than it.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\nThe whole is greater than the part.\n\n\nThe premises themselves of this argument must be justified through the\noperation of the intellect or the faculty of distinction (to use Ibn\nal-Haytham\u2019s own terminology) upon the data we receive through\nour senses (Sabra 1989: vol. I, 133\u201334; Ighbariah & Wagner\n2018). The traces of these attitudes towards the axioms and common\nnotions can be found in the works of Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b and some of later mutikallim\u016bn\n(Morrison 2014: 220\u201322; Hasan 2017: sec. 2.4.2; Ighbariah and\nWagner 2018: 66\u201368).\n2.3 Ars Analytica and Ars Inveniendi\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Muslim thinkers have also developed\ninteresting theories of how we can arrive at the unknown propositions\nof mathematics from the known ones. In other words, they have offered\ndetailed accounts of how\n step (3)\u2014introduced\n in the previous section\u2014can be taken in the context of\nmathematics in general and geometry in particular. A central question\nin this context was if and how (and to what extent) what is going on\nin the mind of a mathematician when she discovers (or invents) a\nmathematical truth corresponds to what she presents as the proof of\nthis discovery (or invention) on paper. In particular, it was\nimportant for Muslim thinkers to know whether or not the order of the\nsteps a mathematician takes to discover a mathematical truth is\nidentical to the order of different stages of the justifications she\nprovides for that truth.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts in this context is Th\u0101bit Ibn\nQurra\u2019s theory of the psychology of mathematical invention.\nHowever, it was probably his grandson, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ibn\nSin\u0101n (d. 946), who established an independent area of studies\npertinent to the aforementioned questions in his On the Method of\nAnalysis and Synthesis in the Problems of Geometry (R. Rashed\n& Bellosta 2000: chap. I). He categorizes geometrical problems\ninto different groups based on different criteria and, providing\nconcrete examples, explains how each group of problems must be\nanalyzed (ta\u1e25l\u012bl) and how a solution for them can\nbe synthesized (tark\u012bb). He highlights the possible\nerrors and mistakes that one might make in the process of analysis and\nsynthesis and elaborates how they can be avoided. The next important\nfigure in this area is al-Sijz\u012b (d. ~1020), who wrote a book\n(Geometrical Treatise on Problem Solving) on different\nmethods which can facilitate the procedure of problem solving in\ngeometry. But the most mature work among these kinds of studies is\nperhaps Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s F\u012b al-ta\u1e25l\u012bl wa\nal-tark\u012bb (On Analysis and Synthesis; R. Rashed\n2006 [2017: 219\u2013304]). An interesting issue discussed in this\narea of philosophy of mathematics was the nature of undecidable\nproblems; claims for whose truth or falsity we have no proof. This\nissue was discussed in particular by al-Samaw\u02beal (d. 1180) in the\ncontext of the classification of geometrical problems in his\nal-B\u0101hir f\u012b al-jabr. His classification project can\nbe understood as a succession to that of Ibn Sin\u0101n (R. Rashed\n1984b [1994: 41\u201343]; 2008: sec. 3; 2015: 726\u201332).\n2.4 Applicability and Reliability of Mathematics\n\nIf we take mathematical objects as pure mental or estimative\n(mawh\u016bm) objects that are constructed by the mechanism\nof abstraction and have no extramental reality, then it is hardly\njustifiable that mathematics and/or mathematical models on their own\ncan give us reliable knowledge of the extramental world. It should\ncome as no surprise that those who endorse a non-Platonic,\nnon-literalist account of the ontology of mathematics will find this\nscience less certain and perhaps less valuable than sciences like\nphysics and metaphysics. That is why some contemporary scholars, who\nhave read Avicenna as defending a purely abstractionist account of the\nontology of mathematics, argue that for him, mathematics is less\nuseful and inferior to the other two sciences (Hasan 2017:\n225\u201326; Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014: 11\u201313). This rendition\nof Avicenna\u2019s view is of course problematic if we take him as a\nliteralist regarding the nature of mathematical objects. Motivated by\nsimilar concerns, Averroes believes that the fact that the realm of\nmathematical objects is detached from the extramental reality makes\nmathematics play a less significant role in human perfection than\nphysics and metaphysics (Endress 2003: 150).\n\nDoubts about the capability of mathematics to represent the\nextramental world accurately are even more prevalent among atomists\n(Dhanani 1994: 101\u201340; Pines 1936 [1997: 110]). For instance,\nendorsing physical atomism in his later works, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b believes that since magnitudes are supposed to be\ncontinuous in Euclidean geometry, this science cannot present an\naccurate picture of the discontinuous atomistic world (Setia 2006:\n126\u201328).\n\nIn his Al-Maw\u0101qif, al-\u02be\u012aj\u012b challenges the\nreliability of mathematical sciences due to their engagement with\nestimative entities that are frailer (awhan) than a\nspider\u2019s web. This analogy refers to the Quran 29:41\n(Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014: 6\u20137). A similarly skeptical view of\nmathematics is defended by Shams al-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad\nal-Bukh\u0101r\u012b (d. 1429) in his commentary on\nal-K\u0101tib\u012b al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b\u2019s \u1e24ikma\nal-\u02bfayn. Like many of his predecessors, al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b\ncontends that, compared to physics and metaphysics, mathematics is a\nless reliable source of knowledge regarding the concretely existing\nthings. It is in response to such views that al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b\nappeals to the machinery of nafs al-\u02beamr to defend the\nreliability of mathematics. He accepts that mathematical objects are\nestimative and imaginary. But he believes that they are imagined\ncorrectly and in accordance with the extramental reality. In this\nrespect, they are entirely different from fictional entities, like\nruby mountains or two-headed men, which do not\nreflect anything in the extramental reality (Hasan 2017: 7). Although\nmathematics originates from estimation, it can still express\nsignificant truths about things as they are in nafs\nal-\u02beamr. He therefore believes that the judgment of\nestimation can in principle conform to that of intellect; particularly\nin the context of mathematics where the products of estimation are\nconstructed in accordance with what we perceive from the extramental\nworld through our senses. Although mathematical objects are estimative\nentities, they are not the outcome of a fanciful imagination which has\nno connection to reality, or so al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b seems to believe\n(Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014; Hasan 2017). The theory of nafs\nal-\u02beamr was, among other things, the most promising attempt\nby Muslim thinkers to reconcile an anti-realist account of the\nontology of mathematics with a realist account of mathematical truths.\nThis theory is intended to provide an explanation of how mathematics,\nas the study of purely estimative entities, can be useful in the study\nof the physical world. Unfortunately, the extent of the success of\nthis project has not been comprehensively studied yet.\n3. Conclusion\n\nWhat is presented here is just a brief report of the interesting\nphilosophical views that medieval Muslim thinkers developed about\nmathematics. It is by no means exhaustive. Many aspects of the views I\ndiscussed here have not yet been studied in the secondary literature.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the philosophy of mathematics of\nmany Muslim philosophers has not been sufficiently addressed by\ncontemporary historians of philosophy. But I hope that the things\nbrought together in this entry have shown that the Islamic tradition\nis a rich resource for innovative ideas and theories pertinent to the\nphilosophy of mathematics (and not\u2014as is usually\nthought\u2014only to the technical aspects of mathematics).\n",
