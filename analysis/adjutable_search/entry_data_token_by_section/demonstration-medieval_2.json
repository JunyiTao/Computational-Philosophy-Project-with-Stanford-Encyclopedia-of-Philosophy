    "main_text": "The Criticism of Grosseteste by Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas\n4. The Criticism of Grosseteste by Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas\n\n\nThe earliest commentary on the Posterior Analytics other\nthan Grosseteste's to gain any general currency in Europe was that of\nAlbert the Great (ca. 1200-1280), written between 1245 and 1260. His\ncommentary takes a different form from Grosseteste's. It is composed of\nten Treatises on each of the two books of Aristotle's work, each\ntreatise approaching a topic as a subject of controversy, on which\nAlbert reports every view he can find from Arabic and Ancient\ncommentators, as well as the moderns. It also has different content,\nfor as an Aristotelian, Albert objected to Grosseteste's metaphysical\nviews, and this led him to a different reading of the Posterior\nAnalytics.\n\n\nThe most obvious difference is in Albert's views of the\nsubalternation of one science to another, and the role of mathematics\nin the natural sciences. Since Albert does not accept a substantial\nform of a thing that acts as an exemplar to preexisting matter, and\ndoes not accept the development of lower forms of individuals from\nhigher forms in the mind of God, he rejects the notion that\n\u201cnatural things are founded on mathematical being, and\nmathematical being on divine being \u2026 so that the principles of\nnatural being are mathematical.\u201d (Albert the Great,\nCommentary on the Metaphysics, Book I Chapter 1.) For Albert\nthe unity of a particular thing is rooted in its particular substantial\nform, and does not arise as an expression of a higher, mathematical\nunity, nor can any knowledge of particular natures in themselves be\nobtained through reflection on being itself, or other higher forms.\nEach science must stand on its own, and we cannot even derive the\nspecies from its genus, much less from its mathematically expressible\naccidents.The new account of subalternation worked out by Albert was\naccepted in general by later Aristotelians (for instance, in Ockham,\nSumma Logicae III.II 21), and Grosseteste's account was\nabandoned.\n\n\nConsider the science of harmony. Grosseteste had said that it was\nsubalternate univocally to the science of proportion, for a harmony is\na proportion realized in sounds. Albert objects that in a demonstration\nwithin the science of harmony, the real explanation why it is so does\nnot occur in the science of proportion, for the subject of the science\nis sounds, not proportions, and what is true of proportions cannot be\napplied to harmonies directly, as though a sound were a mathematical\nentity. Sounds do have certain mathematically expressible accidents,\nbut the science of proportions does not establish the substance or\nnature of sounds. It bears only on those accidents. The two sciences\nare not univocal, that is, they do not have the same subject. Rather,\nthe subject of the higher science is an accident of the subject of the\nlower science. So the subject of harmony is a certain kind of sound,\nnot a certain kind of proportion. To explain why, we will have to trace\nthe fact, not from the nature of proportionality, striving to introduce\nitself into a certain kind of material, but from the nature of sound.\nNature operates by its own principles, and if it accomplishes the aims\nof some higher form, this is because God created it so that it would\naccomplish those aims of itself. God created it from nothing, rather\nthan its evolving from a higher form striving to realize itself in\nmatter.\n\n\nFrom this Albert concludes that the science of the human body might\nbe subalternated to mathematics, after all, and when Aristotle says\nmedicine is not subalternate to geometry, he only means that the whole\nof medicine is not subalternate to geometry in the way that the whole\nof optics is, say. Instead, only a few medical demonstrations are\nsubalternate to geometry. They are, however, subalternate to geometry\nin exactly the same way as the demonstrations in optics are, for optics\nis the science of light, and geometry bears only on certain accidents\nof light, not on light itself, and does not explain why light has those\naccidents.\n\n\nThomas Aquinas agrees with Albert on these matters. In his literal\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics (1269-72) he notes that\nmathematics bears on matter because of the nature of matter, which\nleads it to have mathematical accidents, dimensions, that is, accidents\nwhich can be abstracted from matter and considered on their own in the\nmathematical disciplines without relation to matter. It is only in the\nintellect, through abstraction, that they become separated from matter,\nand their presence in matter is due to the nature of matter, not to any\nsort of prior mathematical reality. But there is something here that is\nnot in Albert, for Albert does not allow the possibility that the\nnature of a thing can cause it to have properties that are not part of\nits essence. He thinks that every accident in a thing is to be traced\nto another accident in the thing, or some accident of something outside\nwhich brings it about that the accident inheres, but that no accident,\nnot even an attribute, that is, a proper accident necessarily belonging\nto that sort of thing, is caused in it by its essence. To Albert's\nmind, this would mean that the nature of a thing, considered in itself\nand not insofar as it is a particular in particular circumstances,\nwould efficiently cause its attribute to inhere in it, and that smacks\nof Platonism, of the view that separated universals somehow play a\ncausal role in the world. Thomas argues that a thing's nature\nefficiently causes its primary attribute, and that it does so\nnecessarily and without exception. This means that the primary\nattribute is always a propensity or capacity, not an actual inherence\nof an occurrent quality, since, of course, the actual inherence of an\noccurrent quality depends on the right conditions being in place for\nthe operation of the capacity to have that quality. Albert allows that\nsuch propensities are necessary in their subjects, and he agrees that\nthey are not part of the subject's essence, so that they follow\ndeductively from its nature, but he allows no sort of efficient\ncausation any role in this process. Efficient causation of this sort is\nreferred to in later Thomistic writers as\n\u201cemanation\u201d\u2014so Cajetan in his commentary on the\nSumma Theologiae I, questions 54 and 77, and Suarez in his\ndiscussion of efficient causation in Metaphysical Disputation\n18.3. But such efficient causation is an impossibility for Albert, for\nAlbert takes it that all efficient causation connects actualities (an\nassumption he perhaps got from Averroes), and seems to take\npropensities and capacities as nothing more than descriptions how\nefficient causality works for one or another kind of thing.\n\n\nPart of the issue rests on the requirement that first principles,\nwhich assert primary, indemonstrable attributes of their subjects, be\nnecessary truths. Thomas takes it that they must be strictly necessary,\nuniversally true in every case at every time. Albert thinks the\nnecessity involved here is of another sort, a conditional necessity, so\nthat the attribute belongs to its subject necessarily, if nothing\nprevents it. Thus he can identify an actuality as a primary\nattribute, allowing that possession of the attribute by the subject\nonly occurs \u201cfor the most part,\u201d and still identify the\nfirst principle asserting this possession of the attribute as a\nnecessary truth. It seems that Thomas Aquinas was less radically\nAristotelian on this point than his master. The metaphysical difference\nled to a notorious and long-lasting dispute over the nature of the\nhighest sort of demonstration (demonstratio potissima).\n",
