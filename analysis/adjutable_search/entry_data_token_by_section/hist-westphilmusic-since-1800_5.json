    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Absolute Music and the Rise of Formalism\n1.6 Absolute Music and the Rise of Formalism\n\nThe nineteenth century witnessed the first explicit vindications of\nabsolute music as an aesthetic ideal (for a history of this concept,\nsee Dahlhaus 1978 [1989], Pederson 2009, and Bonds 2014). The term was\nfirst used in 1846 by Wagner, who then employed it pejoratively in his\n1849\u201351 writings in order to refer to music lacking any\nessential social function\u2014in this sense, music is absolute\ninsofar as it is socially autonomous (on Wagner\u2019s uses of\n\u201cabsolute music\u201d, see Grey 1995: 2; Chua 1999: 225;\nPederson 2009: 241\u2013245; Bonds 2014: 134 ff.). Wagner\u2019s\nopponents appropriated the term in this second sense, to denote music\nthat is not accompanied by a text, program, or other conceptual\nprompts. In this sense, the symphony was considered the paradigmatic\nexample of absolute music (see Dahlhaus 1978 [1989: 10\u201311]).\nAbsolute music is thus purely instrumental music\u2014this is also\nhow the expression is typically used today. The concept of absolute\nmusic may be used in a purely descriptive fashion: it denotes a subset\nof all musical works. However, nineteenth century aesthetics often\nadopted a normative view of absolute music as purely instrumental\nmusic. The view holds that music\u2019s value is irreducible to that\nof other art forms, and that instrumental music is valuable for its\nformal properties, rather than for any content it may disclose (if it\ncan do so in the first place), or feelings it may arouse. This is\nmusical formalism.\n\nWhile Kant was likely not a formalist (see the entry\n history of western philosophy of music: from antiquity to 1800, section 3.6),\n Young (2020: 180) observes that he was considered one from as early\nas the 1820s, as evident from the work of the Swiss composer\nHans-Georg N\u00e4geli (1773\u20131836). N\u00e4geli gives early\nformulations of various standard formalist views. He argues that music\ndoes not have any determinate emotional character, as shown by the\nfact that people cannot agree on it if asked. Accordingly, music does\nnot convey specific affects (Affekten), but merely moods\n(Stimmungen). It does not have any content (Inhalt),\nbut merely form (Form) (N\u00e4geli 1826: 32).\n\nIn addition to Kant\u2019s aesthetics (or at least their\ninterpretation of it), formalists could count on the support of a\nmajor philosopher, Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776\u20131841), who\nadopted an influential and undeniably formalist view of art. He\ndefended the specificity of each art form, and distinguished the\neffects of the beautiful from the beautiful itself, the latter being\nthe proper object of aesthetic appreciation.\n\nTo N\u00e4geli and Herbart is indebted the greatest representative of\nmusical formalism, Eduard Hanslick (1825\u20131904) (for a discussion\nof Hanslick\u2019s forerunners, see Bonds 2014: 157 ff.; Wilfing 2018\ndebunks the widespread view that Kant exercised a decisive influence\non Hanslick).\n\nHanslick\u2019s brief treatise On the Musically Beautiful\n(1854) is one of the most influential works in history of musical\naesthetics. The work gives a concise and persuasive formulation of the\ncardinal tenets of formalism. The book opens with a series of\narguments against what he calls \u201cthe aesthetics of\nfeeling\u201d (Hanslick 1854 [2018]: chapter 1). This is the Romantic\nconception of music as concerned with the representation and arousal\nof emotions. The negative part of Hanslick\u2019s work establishes\nthat music cannot represent feelings, and that music\u2019s arousal\nof feelings, while possible, is irrelevant to its aesthetic\nappreciation. Hanslick\u2019s positive thesis is that the\nappreciation of music involves the intellect (Geist) rather\nthan the emotions, as music\u2019s only content is its form.\n\nHanslick\u2019s negative argument against the aesthetics of feeling\npasses through two main lines of attack: a series of rather weak\nobservations, and a brilliant argument grounded on a conceptual\nanalysis of emotion.\n\nHanslick observes that, when instrumental music is unaccompanied by a\ntext, music lovers are unable to indicate the feeling it expresses\nwith any considerable degree of intersubjective agreement. He famously\nadapts an example from Boy\u00e9, noting that Gluck\u2019s famous\naria \u201cChe far\u00f2 senza Euridice\u201d, expressive of\ndejection and despair, could express equally well joy if paired with a\nhappy text (Hanslick 1854: chapter 2). The argument is supposed to\nprove that music is expressively neutral, but it only works because of\nthe tendentious example. Music with a more clearly anguished character\nthan Gluck\u2019s aria is easy to find, and it would resist pairing\nwith a happy text.\n\nHanslick further observes that a recitative would lose its poignant\nand specific expressive character if played unaccompanied by words.\nHowever, it is unsurprising that music designed to represent emotions\ntogether with a text is less able to do so on its own.\n\nHanslick also notes that music lovers would agree that a large and\nimportant part of the Western repertoire, exemplified by Bach\u2019s\nWell-Tempered Clavier, does not represent any determinate\nemotion (Hanslick 1854: chapter 2). While this is a refutation of the\nclaim that music necessarily represents emotions, it is\nirrelevant to the view that music may do so.\n\nFinally, Hanslick produces what Kivy (1990b: 7) dubbed an\n\u201cargument from disagreement\u201d. Music critics will largely\nconcur about the beauty of various works of music, but they will\ndisagree when asked about the feeling they represent (Hanslick 1854:\nchapter 2). This is once more a weak argument, as it is easy to find\nworks of music that are consistently characterized as expressive of\nsome emotions, and not others.\n\nHanslick\u2019s strongest claim against the aesthetics of feeling\ninvolves a subtle conceptual analysis of the structure of emotions.\nHanslick observes that these cannot be identified by means of the\nfeeling state they produce in us, as the same emotion may arouse\ndifferent states, and two different emotions may share a similar one.\nThe additional component that allows us to discriminate between\ndifferent emotions is conceptual content. In Hanslick\u2019s example,\nhope requires a concept of a future, better condition, whereas\nmelancholy presupposes a comparison with a happier past. Hanslick\nconcedes that music may be able to match the dynamic profile\ncharacteristic of a feeling state. However, music cannot provide the\nconceptual content that is necessary to the identification of specific\nemotions, and it cannot therefore represent them (Hanslick 1854:\nchapter 2; Kivy [1990b: 9] observes that Hanslick\u2019s analysis\nanticipates the contemporary cognitive theory of emotions, first\nproposed in Kenny 1963; Alexander Malcolm [1721: 602] adumbrates the\nsame argument, though he is discussing aroused emotions, as opposed to\nrepresented ones).\n\nHanslick\u2019s positive view is that musical value is specifically\nmusical, independent from any relation to other art forms, as well as\nto any concept derived from extra-musical reality. He does not give up\ntalk of musical content entirely, but rather holds that this content\nis constituted by formal structures, \u201csonically moved\nforms\u201d (t\u00f6nend bewegte Formen; Hanslick 1854\n[2018]: chapter 3; an earlier, influential translation [Hanslick 1986]\nrenders the expression as \u201ctonally moving forms\u201d).\n\nAlthough he denied that music may represent emotions, Hanslick\nconcedes that it often arouses them. However, the emotions aroused by\nmusic are irrelevant to its aesthetic appreciation, as they do not\nhave a bearing on the understanding of music\u2019s formal\nproperties.\n\nHanslick explicitly describes On the Musically Beautiful as a\nreaction to Wagner and Liszt (see Bonds 2014: 155), and the treatise\nis at times explicitly polemical (see for instance the end of chapter\n2). There is in principle no tension between Hanslick\u2019s claim\nthat instrumental music\u2019s content is limited to its form, and\nWagner\u2019s use of music in combination with other art forms. In\nfact, the creation of hybrid works is an obvious way to address\ninstrumental music\u2019s alleged semantic and expressive paucity.\nHowever, Wagner\u2019s protestations against instrumental music and\nits inadequacy to his own goals were so radical that they threatened\nthe aesthetic legitimacy of absolute music. This is what Hanslick set\nout to restore.\n\nThe historian and musicologist Ottokar Hostinsk\u00fd\n(1847\u20131910) attempted to reconcile Wagner\u2019s and\nHanslick\u2019s views (Hostinsk\u00fd 1877; see also Lippman 1992:\n316\u2013317). His strategy was to argue for the possibility of\nhybrid art forms, while at the same time allowing for a specifically\nmusical beauty that is manifested in absolute music.\n\nWhile considerably less explored than his controversy with Wagner,\nHanslick\u2019s relation to Hegel is also interesting. Hegel\u2019s\nclaim regarding music\u2019s ability to express subjective life\nsurely falls within the scope of the negative argument laid out in\nOn the Musically Beautiful. However, Hanslick makes a\ncharacteristically Hegelian move when he holds that musical form is\nmusic\u2019s content. This is not a gratuitously paradoxical\nformulation, but rather bears the mark of Hegel\u2019s conception of\nbeauty as constituted by both form and content.\n\nHanslick\u2019s treatise was enormously influential, and it remains\nwidely discussed (for a review of early reactions, see Bonds 2014:\nappendix; recent work on Hanslick includes Landerer and Zangwill 2017,\nSousa 2017, and Wilfing 2018). Recent scholarship has challenged the\npredominant formalist interpretation of Hanslick\u2019s view (see\nHall 1995, and Wilfing 2016).\n",
