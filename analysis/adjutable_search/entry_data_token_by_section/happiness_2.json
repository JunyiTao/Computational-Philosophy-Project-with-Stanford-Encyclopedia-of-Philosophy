    "main_text": "Theories of happiness || The chief candidates\n2.1 The chief candidates\n\nPhilosophers have most commonly distinguished two accounts of\nhappiness: hedonism, and the life satisfaction\ntheory. Hedonists identify happiness with the individual\u2019s\nbalance of pleasant over unpleasant experience, in the same way that\nwelfare hedonists\n do.[5]\n The difference is that the hedonist about happiness need not accept\nthe stronger doctrine of welfare hedonism; this emerges clearly in\narguments against the classical Utilitarian focus on happiness as the\naim of social choice. Such arguments tend to grant the\nidentification of happiness with pleasure, but challenge the idea that\nthis should be our primary or sole concern, and often as well the idea\nthat happiness is all that matters for well-being.\n\nLife satisfaction theories identify happiness with having a\nfavorable attitude toward one\u2019s life as a whole. This basic\nschema can be filled out in a variety of ways, but typically involves\nsome sort of global judgment: an endorsement or affirmation of\none\u2019s life as a whole. This judgment may be more or less\nexplicit, and may involve or accompany some form of affect. It may\nalso involve or accompany some aggregate of judgments about particular\nitems or domains within one\u2019s\n life.[6]\n\nA third theory, the emotional state view, departs from\nhedonism in a different way: instead of identifying happiness with\npleasant experience, it identifies happiness with an agent\u2019s\nemotional condition as a whole, of what is often called \u201cemotional\n well-being.\u201d[7]\n This includes nonexperiential aspects of emotions and moods (or\nperhaps just moods), and excludes pleasures that don\u2019t directly\ninvolve the individual\u2019s emotional state. It might also include\na person\u2019s propensity for experiencing various moods,\nwhich can vary over time, though several authors have argued against\nthis suggestion (e.g., Hill 2007, Klausen 2015, Rossi 2018). Happiness\non such a view is more nearly the opposite of depression or\nanxiety\u2014a broad psychological condition\u2014whereas hedonistic\nhappiness is simply opposed to unpleasantness. For example, a deeply\ndistressed individual might distract herself enough with constant\nactivity to maintain a mostly pleasant existence\u2014broken only by\ntearful breakdowns during the odd quiet moment\u2014thus perhaps\ncounting as happy on a hedonistic but not emotional state view. The\nstates involved in happiness, on an emotional state view, can range\nwidely, far more so that the ordinary notion of mood or emotion. On\none proposal, happiness involves three broad categories of affective\nstate, including \u201cendorsement\u201d states like joy versus\nsadness, \u201cengagement\u201d states like flow or a sense of\nvitality, and \u201cattunement\u201d states like tranquility,\nemotional expansiveness versus compression, and confidence. Given the departures from commonsensical notions of being in a\n\u201cgood mood,\u201d happiness is characterized in this proposal\nas \u201cpsychic affirmation,\u201d or \u201cpsychic\nflourishing\u201d in pronounced forms.\n\nA fourth family of views, hybrid theories, attempts an irenic\nsolution to our diverse intuitions about happiness: identify happiness\nwith both life satisfaction and pleasure or emotional state, perhaps\nalong with other states such as domain satisfactions. The most obvious\ncandidate here is subjective well-being, which is typically\ndefined as a compound of life satisfaction, domain satisfactions, and\npositive and negative affect. (Researchers often seem to identify\nhappiness with subjective well-being, sometimes with life\nsatisfaction, and perhaps most commonly with emotional or hedonic\nstate.) The chief appeal of hybrid theories is their inclusiveness:\nall the components of subjective well-being seem important, and there\nis probably no component of subjective well-being that does not at\ntimes get included in \u201chappiness\u201d in ordinary usage.\n",
