    "main_text": "Applications || Epidemiology and Meta-Analysis\n5.2 Epidemiology and Meta-Analysis\n\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox in its various forms has attracted a lot of\nattention in the epidemiological literature since it is relevant for\ndetermining and estimating the effect size of medical treatments, and\nthe effect of exposure to risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol) on\nmedical hazards.\n\nOne of the aims behind the methodology of randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) is to eliminate the effect of potential confounders on whether\na person is treated or not. This was described in\n Section 2.2\n as row-uniform design (for experiments with categorical data). For\nexample, if we ensure the same proportion of both genders in the\ntreatment and control group, the same prevalence of different age\ngroups, etc., we know that association reversal (AR) cannot occur with\nrespect to those third variables, and also the amalgamation paradox\n(AMP) is ruled out for many measures.\n\nHowever, the (log-)odds ratio, a popular measure of effect size in\nepidemiological research, shows a deviant behavior. Uniformly\nassigning individuals to treatment and control condition reliably\nproduces the AMP for the odds ratio whenever the third\nvariable (=the subpopulation attribute) influences the success rate,\ngiven the treatment level (Theorem 2.4, Samuels 1993). The odds ratio\nis thus a particularly tricky association measure. Greenland (1987)\ngives the instructive example of an odds ratio that is equal in all\nsubpopulations with row-uniform design, but halved when data are\npooled.\n\nMeta-analytic problems, such as pooling various\nstudies for determining the overall effect size of an intervention or\nrisk factor give a particularly interesting twist to Simpson\u2019s\nParadox. How should such studies be aggregated? Na\u00efvely, somebody\nmay suggest to pool the data from all studies and to treat them as a\nsingle big study. This may work out if the study populations are very\nsimilar and the data are from RCTs, where the treatment/control ratio\nis typically 50:50. If this is indeed the case, then the overall\ndataset is row-uniform and AR (and for most measures, AMP) is avoided,\nas shown in\n Section 2.2.\n But for non-experimental data, there is no reason to assume that\ntreatment/control proportions are equal across studies. Thus, the\ndirection of the direction of the effect can be reversed when pooling\n(for examples, see Hanley & Th\u00e9riault 2000; Reintjes, Boer,\nPelt, & Mintjes-de Groot 2000; R\u00fccker & Schumacher\n2008).\n\nAnother reason for not pooling the data is that study populations are\noften heterogenous and that calculating the strength of association\n(i.e., the effect size) on the basis of the data may bias the estimate\nin the direction of the study with the largest sample size, while the\ncharacteristics of patients in that study need not be representative\nof the target group as a whole. In particular, while at the level of\nstudies patients are usually assigned randomly to the treatment or\ncontrol group, this cannot be said about the aggregate data (Cates\n2002). Proper meta-analysis therefore proceeds on the basis of\nweighting the effects rather than pooling the data, either by a fixed\neffects model or (e.g., if the study populations are heterogenous) by\nintroducing a random effect of the study in the statistical model. The\nquestion of how to conduct a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies\nis also entangled with the choice of an association or effect size\nmeasure (Altman & Deeks 2002; Cates 2002; Greenland 1987), a\nquestion discussed in\n Section 2.2.\n",
