Formal Property Theories and their applications\n\nFormal property theories are logical systems that aim at formulating\n\u201cgeneral noncontingent laws that deal with properties\u201d\n(Bealer & M\u00f6nnich 1989: 133). In the next subsection we shall\noutline how they work. In the two subsequent subsections we shall\nbriefly consider their deployment in natural language semantics and\nthe foundations of mathematics, which can be taken to provide further\nreasons for the acknowledgment of properties in one\u2019s ontology,\nor at least of certain kinds of properties.\n",
