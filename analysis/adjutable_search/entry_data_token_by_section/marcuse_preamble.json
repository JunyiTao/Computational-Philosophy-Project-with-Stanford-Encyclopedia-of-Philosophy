    "main_text": "\n Herbert Marcuse (1898\u20131979) was one of the most prominent\nmembers of the Frankfurt School or The Institute for Social Research\n(Institute f\u00fcr Sozialforschung) in Frankfurt am Main. The\nFrankfurt School was formed in 1922 but went into exile in the United\nStates in the early 1930s during the reign of the Third\nReich. Although most of his colleagues returned to Germany after World\nWar II, Marcuse remained in the United States. \n\nThe Frankfurt School has had an enormous impact on philosophy as\nwell as social and political theory in the United States and around the\nworld. In the 1960s Marcuse ascended to prominence and became one\nof the best known philosophers and social theorists in the\nworld. He was often referred to as the Guru of the New Left (a\ntitle which he rejected). During the late 1970s through the\n1990s, Marcuse\u2019s popularity began to wane as he was eclipsed by\nsecond and third generation critical theorists, postmodernism, Rawlsian\nliberalism, and his former colleagues Theodor Adorno and Walter\nBenjamin. In recent years there has been a new surge of interest\nin Marcuse.\n",
