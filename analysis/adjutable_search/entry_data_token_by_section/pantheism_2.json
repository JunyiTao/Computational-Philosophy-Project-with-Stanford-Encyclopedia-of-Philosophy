    "main_text": "The logic of identity\n3. The logic of identity\n\nThe pantheist asserts an identity between God and nature, but it needs\nto be asked in just what sense we are to understand the term\n\u2018identity\u2019? To begin with it is necessary to raise two\nambiguities in the logic of identity.\n\n(1) Dialectical identity. It is important to note that many\npantheists will not accept the classical logic of identity in which\npairs are straightforwardly either identical or different. They may\nadopt rather the logic of relative identity, or\nidentity-in-difference, by which it is possible to maintain that God\nand the cosmos are simultaneously both identical and different, or to\nput the matter in more theological language, that God is\nsimultaneously both transcendent and immanent. For example, Eriugena\nholds that the universe may be subdivided into four categories: things\nwhich create but are not created, things which create and are created,\nthings which are created but do not create, and things which neither\ncreate nor are created. He argues that all four reduce to God, and\nhence \u201cthat God is in all things, i.e. that he subsists as their\nessence. For He alone by Himself truly has being, and He alone is\neverything which is truly said to be in things endowed with\nbeing\u201d (Periphyseon, 97). But nonetheless, for\nEriugena, the uncreated retains its distinct status separate from the\ncreated, not least in that the former may be understood while the\nlater transcends all understanding. In consequence, he insists that\nGod is not the genus of which creatures are the species. Similarly,\nthe Sufi philosopher, ibn \u2018Arabi identifies God and the\nuniverse, suggesting in a striking metaphor that the universe is the\nfood of God and God the food of the universe; as deity swallows up the\ncosmos so the cosmos swallows up deity (Bezels of Wisdom,\n237; Husaini 1970, 180). But Ibn \u2018Arabi in no sense regards such\nclaims as preventing him from insisting also on the fundamental gulf\nbetween the unknowable essence of God and his manifest being. We must\ndistinguish between the nature of God and the nature of things,\nbetween that which exists by itself (God) and that which exist by\nanother (the universe), but since the nature of God just is Being\nitself, no parallel distinction may be drawn between the being of God\nand the being of things. Nothing real exists besides God who discloses\nhimself in and through the universe (Chittick 1989, ch.5). Again,\nNicholas of Cusa\u2019s celebrated doctrine of the \u2018coincidence\nof opposites\u2019\u2014which he memorably illustrated by pointing\nto way in which, upon infinite expansion, a circle must coincide with\na straight line\u2014allows him to say both that God and the\ncreation are the same thing and that there exists a\nfundamental distinction between the realm of absolute being and the\nrealm of limited or contracted being (Moran 1990). Even Spinoza goes\nto great lengths to show that the two attributes of thought\nand extension by which we pick out the one substance as\n\u2018God\u2019 or \u2018nature\u2019 are nonetheless at the same\ntime irreducibly different. They may be co-referring but they are not\nsynonymous; indeed, they are utterly incommensurable. Such a\ndialectical conception of unity, in which there can be no identity\nwithout difference, is a strong element in Hegel\u2019s thought, and\nalso one aspect of what Hartshorne meant by dipolar theism;\nthe opposites of immanence and transcendence are included among those\nwhich he thinks God brings together in his being.\n\n(2) Partial Identity. Even accepting a classical conception\nof identity and difference, there remain issues to settle. If we think\nof pantheism negatively as a rejection of the view that God is\ndistinct from the cosmos, we would face four possible schemes by which\nwe might represent their mereological relation: we might understand\nGod as proper part of nature, we might take nature as a proper part of\nGod, we might regard the two domains as partially overlapping, or else\nwe might hold that they are strictly identical.\n\nReflecting upon the ambiguities of the previous two paragraphs, it\nmight be argued that only where we find strict classical identity do\nwe have pantheism. For if the universe is not wholly divine we have\nmere immanentism, while if God includes but is not exhausted\nby the universe then we have rather panentheism. Now,\ncertainly it may be allowed there are metaphysical schemes for which\nthe range of overlap between divinity and the cosmos is so small that\nthey fail to capture the spirit of pantheism. (For example, a\nworld-view in which God were understood as the vital spark which\nanimates an otherwise dead and motionless cosmos, or a world-view in\nwhich the cosmos were merely one small fraction of the being of God\nwould indeed seem far from the spirit of pantheism.) However, to limit\nthe term\u2019s application to just those schemes advancing strict\nclassical identity would be far too restrictive.\n\nSuch \u2018strict identity\u2019 is virtually impossible to define\ndue to the extreme difficulty of stipulating what would count as an\nacceptable and what as an unacceptable sense, part, aspect, or element\nof difference. For example, Aquinas distinguishes between the doctrine\nthat God is the form of all things (\u2018formal pantheism\u2019)\nand the doctrine that God is the matter of all things (\u2018material\npantheism\u2019) (Moran 1989, 86). Does either of these count as\npantheism \u2018proper\u2019, or must both obtain at the same time?\nAgain, while some pantheists conceive of deity in mereological terms\nas the collection of things which make up the universe, many others\nhave found this approach inadequate, maintaining that in some\nimportant sense \u2018the whole is greater than the sum of its\nparts.\u2019 The finite things that we encounter around us and are\nhappy enough to describe as parts of nature we feel less\nhappy to think of as parts of God. Such theorists may also\nreject the charge that their way of thinking is\npanentheistic, maintaining that the proper lesson to draw is\nnot one of the transcendence of the holistic view but rather one\nconcerning the degree of unreality or abstraction involved in any\ndistributed view. In short, does any admission of difference\nbetween the world as common-sense experiences it and the divine cosmos\nas pantheism understands it amount to a concession either that there\nare aspects of experience which fall outside deity or aspects of deity\nwhich fall outside experience? If so, then the class of \u2018true\npantheists\u2019 threatens to become null. In the end, rather than\nattempt to draw sharp but artificial and contentious lines it seems\nmore fruitful to maintain that the boundaries of demarcation between\nimmanence, pantheism, and panentheism are vague and porous.\n\nThis approach has the further advantage of keeping together\nhistorically cognate thinkers. If the essence of pantheism lies in\nstrict classical identity, the issue of who is or is not a pantheist\ncomes down to the somewhat arcane dispute whether there could be any\nconceivable aspect or side of reality which was not natural, and/or\nwhether there could be any conceivable aspect or side of reality which\nwas not divine, but these are abstruse points that can only take us\naway from the fundamental pantheistic intuition of the overlap of God\nand nature, the intuition that that in grasping the reality before us\nwe grasp God himself, not something separate or intermediary.\n",
