    "main_text": "Descriptive Accounts, Content-Directed || Relation to truth\n3.1 Relation to truth\n\nFrege (1918a [TFR: 329]) held that an assertion is an outward sign of\na judgment (Urteil). A judgment in turn, in\nFrege\u2019s view, is a step from entertaining a Thought to\nacknowledging its truth (Frege 1892 [TPW:\n 64]).[11]\n The subject first merely thinks the Thought that p, and\nthen, at the judgment stage, moves on to acknowledge it as true. Since\nfor Frege, the truth value is the reference (Bedeutung) of a\nsentence, a judgment is an advance from the sense of a sentence to its\nreference. In case the subject makes a mistake, it is not the actual\nreference, but the reference the subject takes it to\nhave.\n\nFor Frege, truth is not relative. There is exactly one point of\nevaluation of a Thought, the world itself. If instead we accept more\nthan one point of evaluation, such as different possible worlds, truth\nsimpliciter is equated with truth at the actual world. We can\nthen adapt Frege\u2019s view to say that judging that p is\nadvancing to reference at the actual world, or again,\nevaluating as true in the actual world.\n\nOn this picture, what holds for judgment carries over to assertion. It\nis in the force of an utterance that the step is taken from the\ncontent to the actual point of evaluation. This view has been stated\nby Recanati with respect to the actual world:\n\n\n[\u2026] a content is not enough; we need to connect that content\nwith the actual world, via the assertive force of the utterance, in\nvirtue of which the content is presented as characterizing that world.\n(Recanati 2007: 37)\n\n\nIn Pagin (2016a: 276\u2013278), this idea is generalized. If contents\nare possible-worlds propositions, the points of evaluation are\npossible worlds. All actual judgments are then applications of\npropositions to the actual world. If contents are\ntemporal propositions, true or false with respect to\nworld-time pairs, then all actual judgments are applications to the\nordered pair of the actual world and a relevant time, usually the time\nat which the judgment is made. This is the point with respect to which\na sentence, used in a context of utterance, has its truth value (cf.\nKaplan 1989: 522). Again, the relation is general: if the content of a\njudgment is a function from indices of some type to truth\nvalues, then a judgment is the very step of taking the content to be\ntrue at the actual/current index, or again applying the\ncontent to that index. The force of an assertion, on this\nview, connects the content of the assertion with the relevant index.\nThe assertion indicates that the content is true at the\nindex.\n\nOn the more social side, it is often said that in asserting a\nproposition the speaker \u201cpresents the proposition as true\u201d\n(cf. Wright 1992: 34). Prima facie, this characterizes\nassertion well. However, there are problems with the idea. One is that\nit should generalize to other speech act types, but does not seem to\ndo so. For instance, does a question present a proposition as one the\nspeaker would like to know the truth value of? If so, it does\nnot seem that this way of presenting the proposition distinguishes\nbetween the interrogative force in\n (17a),\n the optative force in\n (17b),\n and the imperative force in\n (17c).\n\n(17)\n\n\na.\nIs Elsa at home?\nb.\nI would like to know whether Elsa is at home.\nc.\nInform me whether Elsa is at home!\n \n\n\nIf other speech act types could be characterized in ways analogous to\nassertion, that would strengthen the proposal. If not, it appears to\nbe a weakness.\n\nAnother problem is that it remains unclear what\n\u201cpresenting\u201d amounts to. It must be a sense of the word\ndifferent from that in which the proposition is presented as true in\nthe sentence\n\n(18)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true.\n\n\neven if the sentence is not uttered assertorically. That is,\n\u201cpresent as true\u201d must not refer to a feature simply of\ncontent. Since there is a sense of \u201cpresent as\nsuch-and-such\u201d that does refer to representational\ncontent, there is a need to specify, in a non-question-begging way,\nthe other sense of \u201cpresent\u201d that is relevant.\n\nIn addition, there is a question of distinguishing the assertoric way\nof presenting something as true from weaker illocutionary\nalternatives, such as guesses and conjectures, which also in some\nsense present their contents as being true.\n\nThere are therefore weaker senses of \u201cpresent as true\u201d,\nwhich do not require that the presentation itself is made with\nassertoric force (like an obsolete label on a bottle), and these\nsenses are too weak. There is clearly also a stronger sense that\ndoes require assertoric force (for cases when the label is\ntaken to apply), but that is just what we want to have\n(non-circularly) explained. Simply using the phrase \u201cpresent as\ntrue\u201d does not by itself help.\n\nAnother idea for characterizing assertion in terms of truth-related\nattitudes is that assertion aims at truth. This is stated for\ninstance both by Bernard Williams (1966), by Michael Dummett (1973\n[1981]), and more recently by Marsili (2018). The notion of\n\u201caiming at truth\u201d can be understood in rather different\nways (for some ways of understanding what it could be for\nbelief to aim at truth, see Engel 2004 and Gl\u00fcer &\nWikforss\n 2013).[12]\n\nWilliams (1966) characterizes assertion\u2019s aim in different\nterms. For him, the property of aiming at truth is what characterizes\nfact-stating discourse, as opposed to, e.g., evaluative or\ndirective discourse. It is natural to think of\n\n(19)\nThe moon is about 384.000 km from the Earth.\n\n\nas stating a fact, and of\n\n(20)\nBardot is good.\n\n\nas expressing an evaluation, not corresponding to any fact of the\nmatter. On Williams\u2019s view, to regard a sincere utterance of\n\n(21)\nIt is wrong to steal.\n\n\nas a moral assertion, is to take a realistic\nattitude to moral discourse: there are moral facts, making moral\nstatements objectively true or false. This view again comes in two\nversions. On the first alternative, the existence of moral facts\nrenders the discourse fact-stating, whether the speaker thinks so or\nnot, and the non-existence renders it evaluative, again whether the\nspeaker thinks so or not. On the second alternative, an utterance of\n (21)\n is an assertion if the speaker has a realistic attitude towards moral\ndiscourse and otherwise not.\n\nOn these views, it is assumed that truth is a substantial property\n(Williams 1966: 202), not a concept that can be characterized in some\ndeflationary way. As a consequence, the sentence\n\n(22)\n\u201cBardot is good\u201d is true.\n\n\nis to be regarded as false, since\n (22)\n is objectively neither true nor false; there is no fact of the\n matter.[13]\n",
