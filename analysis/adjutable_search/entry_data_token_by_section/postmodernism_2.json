Genealogy and Subjectivity\n\nThe Nietzschean method of genealogy, in its application to modern\nsubjectivity, is another facet of philosophical postmodernism. Michel\nFoucault's application of genealogy to formative moments in\nmodernity's history and his exhortations to experiment with\nsubjectivity place him within the scope of postmodern discourse. In\nthe 1971 essay \u201cNietzsche, Genealogy, History,\u201d Foucault\nspells out his adaptation of the genealogical method in his\nhistorical studies. First and foremost, he says, genealogy\n\u201copposes itself to the search for \u2018origins\u2019\u201d\n(Foucault 1977, 141). That is, genealogy studies the accidents and\ncontingencies that converge at crucial moments, giving rise to new\nepochs, concepts, and institutions. As Foucault remarks: \u201cWhat\nis found at the historical beginning of things is not the inviolable\nidentity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is\ndisparity\u201d (Foucault 1977, 142). In Nietzschean fashion,\nFoucault exposes history conceived as the origin and development of\nan identical subject, e.g., \u201cmodernity,\u201d as a fiction\nmodern discourses invent after the fact. Underlying the fiction of\nmodernity is a sense of temporality that excludes the elements of\nchance and contingency in play at every moment. In short, linear,\nprogressive history covers up the discontinuities and interruptions\nthat mark points of succession in historical time.\n\nFoucault deploys genealogy to create what he calls a\n\u201ccounter-memory\u201d or \u201ca transformation of history\ninto a totally different form of time\u201d (Foucault 1977,\n160). This entails dissolving identity for the subject in history by\nusing the materials and techniques of modern historical\nresearch. Just as Nietzsche postulates that the religious will to\ntruth in Christianity results in the destruction of Christianity by\nscience (see Nietzsche 1974 [1882], 280\u201383), Foucault\npostulates that genealogical research will result in the\ndisintegration of the epistemic subject, as the continuity of the\nsubject is broken up by the gaps and accidents that historical\nresearch uncovers. The first example of this research is Histoire\nde la folie \u00e0 l'age classique, published in 1961, the\nfull version of which was published in English as History of\nMadness in 2006. Here, Foucault gives an account of the\nhistorical beginnings of modern reason as it comes to define itself\nagainst madness in the seventeenth century.  His thesis is that the\npractice of confining the mad is a transformation of the medieval\npractice of confining lepers in lazar houses. These institutions\nmanaged to survive long after the lepers disappeared, and thus an\ninstitutional structure of confinement was already in place when the\nmodern concept of madness as a disease took shape. However, while\ninstitutions of confinement are held over from a previous time, the\npractice of confining the mad constitutes a break with the past.\n\nFoucault focuses upon the moment of transition, as modern reason\nbegins to take shape in a confluence of concepts, institutions, and\npractices, or, as he would say, of knowledge and power. In its\nnascency, reason is a power that defines itself against an other, an\nother whose truth and identity is also assigned by reason, thus\ngiving reason the sense of originating from itself. For Foucault, the\nissue is that madness is not allowed to speak for itself and is at\nthe disposal of a power that dictates the terms of their\nrelationship. As he remarks: \u201cWhat is originative is the\ncaesura that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason;\nreason's subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as\nmadness, crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this\npoint\u201d (Foucault 1965, x). The truth of reason is found\nwhen madness comes to stand in the place of non-reason, when the\ndifference between them is inscribed in their opposition, but is not\nidentical to its dominant side. In other words, the reason that\nstands in opposition to madness is not identical to the reason that\ninscribes their difference. The latter would be reason without an\nopposite, a free-floating power without definite shape. As Foucault\nsuggests, this free-floating mystery might be represented in the ship\nof fools motif, which, in medieval times, represented madness. Such\nis the paradoxical structure of historical transformation.\n\nIn his later writings, most notably in The Use of Pleasure\n(Foucault 1985 [1984]), Foucault employs historical research to open\npossibilities for experimenting with subjectivity, by showing that\nsubjectivation is a formative power of the self, surpassing the\nstructures of knowledge and power from out of which it emerges. This\nis a power of thought, which Foucault says is the ability of human\nbeings to problematize the conditions under which they live. For\nphilosophy, this means \u201cthe endeavor to know how and to what\nextent it might be possible to think differently, instead of\nlegitimating what is already known\u201d (Foucault 1985 [1984],\n9). He thus joins Lyotard in promoting creative experimentation as a\nleading power of thought, a power that surpasses reason, narrowly\ndefined, and without which thought would be inert. In this regard,\nFoucault stands in league with others who profess a postmodern\nsensibility in regard to contemporary science, art, and society. We\nshould note, as well, that Foucault's writings are a hybrid of\nphilosophy and historical research, just as Lyotard combines the\nlanguage games of the expert and the philosopher in The\nPostmodern Condition. This mixing of philosophy with concepts\nand methods from other disciplines is characteristic of postmodernism\nin its broadest sense.\n",
