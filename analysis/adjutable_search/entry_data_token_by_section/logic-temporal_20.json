The language of the Ockhamist\nbranching time logic is extended by a modality for an\nalternative branch, and a special kind of fan\nvariables is introduced to represent all histories passing\nthrough one instant.\n\nThe branching time logic with indistinguishability functions\ndeveloped in Zanardo (1998) unifies Peirceanism and Ockhamism. The\nlanguage extends the Peircean temporal logic by modal operators, and\nformulae are evaluated on so-called I-trees, which are trees\n\\(\\mathcal{T} = \\langle T,\\prec\\rangle\\) with an indistinguishability\nfunction \\(I\\) that assigns to each time instant in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) a\npartition of the set of histories passing through that instant.\nWhereas in the Ockhamist semantics truth at an instant is relativized\nto a history, in the semantics on I-trees truth at an instant is\nrelativized to an equivalence class modulo indistinguishability at\nthat instant, i.e. to a set of histories. Peirceanism and Ockhamism\ncorrespond to the limiting cases where the partition is trivial, that\nis, a singleton or a set of singletons, respectively. For details, see\nZanardo (1998), as well as Zanardo (2013) and Ciuni and Zanardo\n(2010), where the idea is combined with elements of the stit\nlogic of agency.\n\nAn account that is similar in spirit and likewise unifies Peirceanism\nand Ockhamism is the transition semantics presented in\nRumberg (2016). The novel feature of this framework is that possible\ncourses of events are successively built up from local future\npossibilities: they are viewed as possibly non-maximal,\ndownward-closed chains of transitions, where each transition specifies a possible direction at a branching point. Incomplete possible courses of events become available as well,\nwhich can then be extended towards the future, and the language\ncontains, in addition to temporal and modal operators, a so-called\nstability operator, which allows one to capture how the truth value of\na formula about the future at an instant changes in the course of\ntime. Peirceanism and Ockhamism result as limiting cases by\nrestricting the range of admissible courses of events to the empty set of transitions and\nmaximal chains, respectively. For details, see Rumberg (2016; 2019)\nand Rumberg and Zanardo (2019). A brief overview is presented\nin the supplementary document:\n\nTransition Semantics\n\n",
