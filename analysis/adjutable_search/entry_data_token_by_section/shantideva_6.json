    "main_text": "Ethics and Ethical Theory || Non-Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe BCA and the \u015aS contain some of the best\npoetry and some of the most accessible and powerful teachings on\nno-self and emptiness that the Indian Buddhist tradition ever\nproduced. In several ways, these texts are unique. No other premodern\ntext contains such interesting general reflections about how Buddhist\nteachings on how to live relate to each other and form a coherent\nwhole. The Ownerless Suffering Argument has no exact parallel\nelsewhere in Indian literature. No other Indian text grappled with the\nproblem of free will as carefully and as seriously as the\nBCA. And few, if any, Buddhist writers have ever been as\nskilled as \u015a\u0101ntideva at evoking a remarkable range of\nemotions in the reader. To advance his spiritual goals, he crafted\npassages that are remarkably effective, even today, at arousing\ndisgust, fear, remorse, determination, altruism, generosity,\nlovingkindness, and compassion. For anyone who wishes to understand\nthe philosophical teachings and spiritual aspirations of the mature\nIndian Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist tradition, and to appreciate why\nthese teachings were convincing and these aspirations compelling to\nmany premodern Indians and Tibetans, there is no better source than\nthe works of \u015a\u0101ntideva.\n",
