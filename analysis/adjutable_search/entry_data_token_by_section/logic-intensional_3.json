    "main_text": "A Brief History || Church\n2.2 Church\n\n\nFrege gave the outline of a theory of intensionality, but no\nintensional logic in any formal sense. There have been attempts to\nfill in his outline. Alonzo Church (1951) went at it quite directly.\nIn this paper there is a formal logic in which terms have both senses\nand denotations. These are simply taken to be different sorts, and\nminimal requirements are placed on them. Nonetheless the logic is\nquite complex. The formal logic that Frege had created for his work on\nthe foundations of mathematics was type free. Russell showed his\nfamous paradox applied to Frege\u2019s system, so it was inconsistent. As a\nway out of this problem, Russell developed the type theory that was\nembodied in Principia Mathematica. Church had given an\nelegant and precise formulation of the simple theory of types (Church\n1940), and that was incorporated into his work on intensionality,\nwhich is one of the reasons for its formal complexity.\n\n\nChurch uses a notion he calls a concept, where anything that\nis the sense of a name for something can serve as a concept of that\nsomething. There is no attempt to make this more precise\u2014indeed\nit is not really clear how that might be done. It is explicit that concepts\nare language independent, and might even be uncountable. There is a\ntype \\(\\omicron_{0}\\) of the two truth values. Then, there is a\ntype \\(\\omicron_{1}\\) of concepts of members of\n\\(\\omicron_{0}\\), which are called propositional\nconcepts. There is a type \\(\\omicron_{2}\\) of concepts of\nmembers of \\(\\omicron_{1}\\), and so on. There a type\n\\(\\iota_{0}\\) of individuals, a type \\(\\iota_{1}\\) of\nconcepts of members of \\(\\iota_{0}\\), a type \\(\\iota_{2}\\)\nof concepts of members of \\(\\iota_{1}\\), and so on. And finally,\nfor any two types \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) there is a type\n\\((\\alpha\\,\\beta )\\) of functions from items of type \\(\\beta\\) to\nitems of type \\(\\alpha\\). Church makes a simplifying assumption\nconcerning functional types. In order to state it easily he introduces\nsome special notation: if \\(\\alpha\\) is a type symbol, for example\n\\(((\\iota_{3}\\,\\omicron_{2})(\\omicron_{5}\\,\\iota_{4}))\\),\nthen \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) is the result of increasing each subscript by\n1, in our example we get\n\\(((\\iota_{4}\\,\\omicron_{3})(\\omicron_{6}\\,\\iota_{5}))\\). (There\nis a similar definition for \\(\\alpha_{n}\\) for each\npositive integer \\(n\\), but we will not need it here.) Church\u2019s\nassumption is that the concepts of members of the functional type\n\\((\\alpha\\,\\beta )\\) are the members of the type\n\\((\\alpha_{1}\\,\\beta_{1})\\). With this assumption,\nuniformly the concepts of members of any type \\(\\alpha\\) are the members\nof type \\(\\alpha_{1}\\).\n\n\nQuantification and implication are introduced, or rather versions\nappropriate for the various types are introduced.\n\\(\\lambda\\) abstraction notation is present. And finally, for each\ntype \\(\\alpha\\) it is assumed there is a relation that holds\nbetween a concept of something of type \\(\\alpha\\) and the thing\nitself; this is a relation between members of type\n\\(\\alpha_{1}\\) and members of type \\(\\alpha\\). This\nis denoted \\(\\Delta\\), with appropriate type-identifying subscripts.\n\n\nA fundamental issue for Church is when two names, lambda terms, have\nthe same sense. Three alternatives are considered. Common to all three\nalternatives are the assumptions that sense is unchanged under the\nrenaming of bound variables (with the usual conditions of freeness),\nand under \\(\\beta\\) reduction. Beyond these, Alternative 0 is\nsomewhat technical and is only briefly mentioned, Alternative 1 is fine\ngrained, making senses distinct as far as possible, while Alternative 2\nmakes two terms have the same sense whenever equality between them is a\nlogical validity. The proper definition of the alternatives is\naxiomatic, and altogether various combinations of some 53 axiom schemes\nare introduced, with none examined in detail. Clearly Church was\nproposing an investigation, rather than presenting full results.\n\n\nAs noted, the primary reference for this work is Church 1951, but\nthere are several other significant papers including Church 1973,\nChurch 1974, and the Introduction to Church 1944, which contains an\ninformal discussion of some of the ideas. In addition, the expository\npapers of Anderson are enlightening (Anderson 1984, 1998). It should\nbe noted that there are relationships between Church\u2019s work and that\nof Carnap, discussed below. Church\u2019s ideas first appeared in an\nabstract (Church 1946), then Carnap\u2019s book appeared (Carnap 1947). A\nfew years later Church\u2019s paper expanded his abstract in Church 1951.\nThe second edition of Carnap\u2019s book appeared in 1956. Each man had an\ninfluence on the other, and the references between the two authors are\nthoroughly intertwined.\n",
