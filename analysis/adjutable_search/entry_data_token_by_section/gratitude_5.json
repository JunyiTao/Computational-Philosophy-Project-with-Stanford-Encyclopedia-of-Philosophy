A\nbeneficiary who lacks any motivation to show or inform his benefactor\nof his grateful attitudes (perhaps, say, because he is overly\nprideful) seems to fall short of what gratitude requires, even if he\nhas the appropriate feelings and beliefs regarding her.\n\nGratitude is generally communicated verbally, by thanking; but the\ndemonstration, expression or communication of gratitude can occur\nthrough certain behaviors as well\u2014such as presenting a\nbenefactor with a thank-you gift, or doing her a return-favor. Some\nphilosophers argue that expression or demonstration of grateful\nattitudes may in fact require certain such nonverbal\nbehaviors. Berger (1975) and Swinburne (1989), for instance, argue\nthat if a benefactor\u2019s act of benevolence was especially great,\nonly a return-favor or thank-you gift that is obviously costly to the\nbeneficiary will suffice as an adequate demonstration of especially\nintense feelings and beliefs of gratitude. Whether the acts of\npresenting a benefactor with a thank-you gift or doing her a favor in\nthe future serve only this demonstrative or expressive\nfunction is disputed (see\n section 3.4.2).\n\nAs far as verbal expressions of thanks go, philosophers agree that the\ngrateful beneficiary\u2019s thanks should be sincere; but what\nexactly sincerity consists in will depend on what sort of speech-act\nthanking turns out to be. For philosophers who consider thanking an\nexpressive, thanks will be sincere insofar as they accurately\nreflect grateful beliefs and feelings that are actually present in a\nbeneficiary. Other philosophers suggest that thanks might be sincere\neven if a beneficiary lacks the requisite grateful feelings and\nattitudes at the time of thanking. Camenisch (1981), for instance,\nsuggests that thanking might sometimes be a\ncommissive\u2014a speech-act through which a beneficiary\ncommits himself to developing grateful beliefs, feelings and other\ndispositions that he may not have at the time of thanking. There is a\nparallel here with forgiveness, which may sometimes be granted even\nwhen the forgiver has not yet rid himself of resentful feelings toward\nhis malefactor. In such cases, it might still be fair to say the\nforgiver was sincere in his utterance, if we understand \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d to imply the forgiver\u2019s commitment to ridding\nhimself of such feelings (Griswold 2007).\n",
