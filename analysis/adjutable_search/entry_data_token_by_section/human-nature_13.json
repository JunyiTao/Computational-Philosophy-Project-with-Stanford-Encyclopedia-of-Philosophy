It should,\nhowever, be noted that such accounts can be interpreted as assigning\nthe feature of heightened plasticity the key role in such explanations\n(cf. Montagu 1956: 79). Accounts that make plasticity causally central\nalso raise the question as to whether there are not biological\nfeatures that in turn explain it and should therefore be assigned a\nmore central status in a theory of explanatory human nature.\n\nA prime candidate for this role is what the zoologist Adolf Portmann\nlabelled human \u201csecondary altriciality\u201d, a unique\nconstellation of features of the human neonate relative to other\nprimates: human neonates are, in their helplessness and possession of\na relatively undeveloped brain, neurologically and behaviourally\naltricial, that is, in need of care. However they are also born with\nopen and fully functioning sense organs, otherwise a mark of precocial\nspecies, in which neonates are able to fend for themselves (Portmann\n1951: 44ff.). The facts that the human neonate brain is less than 30%\nof the size of the adult brain and that brain development after birth\ncontinues at the fetal rate for the first year (Walker & Ruff\n1993, 227) led the anthropologist Ashley Montagu to talk of\n\u201cexterogestation\u201d (Montagu 1961: 156). With these features\nin mind, Portmann characterised the care structures required by\nprolonged infant helplessness as the \u201csocial uterus\u201d\n(Portmann 1967: 330). Finally, the fact that the rapid development of\nthe infant brain takes place during a time in which the infant\u2019s\nsense organs are open and functioning places an adaptive premium on\nlearning that is unparalleled among organisms (Gould 1977: 401; cf.\nStotz & Griffiths 2018: 70).\n\nOf course, these features are themselves contingent products of\nevolution that could be outlived by the species. Gould sees them as\ncomponents of a general retardation of development that has\ncharacterised human evolution (Gould 1977: 365ff.), where\n\u201chuman\u201d should be seen as referring to the clade\u2014all\nthe descendants of a common ancestor\u2014rather than to the species.\nAnthropologists estimate that secondary altriciality characterised the\nlineage as from Homo erectus 1.5 million years ago (Rosenberg\n& Trevathan 1995: 167). We are, then, dealing with a set of deeply\nentrenched features, features that were in place long before\nbehavioural modernity.\n\nIt is conceivable that the advent of secondary altriciality was a key\ntransformation in generating the radical plasticity of human\ndevelopment beginning with early hominins. However, as Sterelny points\nout, there are serious difficulties with isolating any particular game\nchanger. Secondary altriciality, or the plasticity that may in part be\nexplained by it, would thus seem to fall victim to the same verdict as\nthe game changers named by the traditional human nature slogans.\nHowever, maybe it is more plausible to think in terms of a matrix of\ntraits: perhaps a game-changing constellation of properties present in\nthe population after the split from pan can be shown to have\ngenerated forms of niche construction that fed back into and modified\nthe original traits. These modifications may in turn have had further\npsychological and behavioural consequences in steps that plausibly\nbrought selective advantages (Sterelny 2018: 115).\n",
