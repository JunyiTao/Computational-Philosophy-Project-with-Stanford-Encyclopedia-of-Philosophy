    "main_text": "\n\nIrving Copi once defined the problem of identity through time by\nnoting that the following two statements both seem true but, on the\nassumption that there is change, appear to be inconsistent: \n\nIf a changing thing really changes, there can't literally be one\nand the same thing before and after the change.\nHowever, if there isn't literally one and the same thing before\nand after the change, then no thing has really undergone any\nchange.\n\n\nTraditionally, this puzzle has been solved in various ways. Aristotle,\nfor example, distinguished between \u201caccidental\u201d and\n\u201cessential\u201d changes. Accidental changes are ones that\ndon't result in a change in an objects' identity after the change,\nsuch as when a house is painted, or one's hair turns gray, etc.\nAristotle thought of these as changes in the accidental properties of\na thing. Essential changes, by contrast, are those which don't\npreserve the identity of the object when it changes, such as when a\nhouse burns to the ground and becomes ashes, or when someone dies.\nArmed with these distinctions, Aristotle would then say that, in the\ncase of accidental changes, (1) is false\u2014a changing thing can\nreally change one of its \u201caccidental properties\u201d and yet\nliterally remain one and the same thing before and after the\nchange.\n\nOf course, this solution to the puzzle depends on there being a\ncoherent distinction between accidental and essential changes, and\nbetween accidental and essential properties. Some philosophers find\nthis distinction problematic and have developed other solutions that\ndon't require this distinction. In what follows, we discuss these\nsolutions to the puzzle, along with other puzzles that arise when\nconsidering the identity of objects over time.\n",
