    "main_text": "Judgement, Criticism and Taste\n7. Judgement, Criticism and Taste\n\nThe first task of the spectator of the work of art\u2014the\ncritic\u2014is for Croce simple: one is to reproduce the intuition,\nor perhaps better, one is to realize the intuition, which is\nthe work of art. One may fail, and Croce is well aware that one may be\nmistaken; \u2018haste, vanity, want of reflexion, theoretic\nprejudices\u2019 may bring it about that one finds beautiful what is\nnot, or fail to find beautiful what is (Aes. 120). But given\nthe foregoing strict distinction between practical technique and\nartistic activity properly so-called, his task is the same as that\nof the artist:\n\nHow could that which is produced by a given activity be judged a\ndifferent activity? The critic may be a small genius, the\nartist a great one \u2026 but the nature of both must remain the\nsame. To judge Dante, we must raise ourselves to his level: let it be\nwell understood that empirically we are not Dante, nor Dante we; but\nin that moment of contemplation and judgement, our spirit is one with\nthat of the poet, and in that moment we and he are one thing.\n(Aes. 121)\n\n\nLeave aside the remark that we become identical with the poet. If by\ntaste we mean the capacity for aesthetic judgement\u2014that is, the\ncapacity to find beauty\u2014and by genius we mean the capacity to\nproduce beauty, then they are the same: the capacity to realize\nintuitions.\n\nIn Croce\u2019s overall philosophy, the aesthetic stands alone: in\nhaving an intuition, one has succeeded entirely insofar as aesthetic\nvalue is concerned. Therefore there cannot be a real question of a\n\u2018standard\u2019 of beauty which an object might or might not\nsatisfy. Thus Croce says:\n\n\u2026the criterion of taste is absolute, but absolute in a\ndifferent way from that of the intellect, which expresses itself in\nratiocination. The criterion of taste is absolute, with the intuitive\nabsoluteness of the imagination. (Aes. 122)\n\n\nOf course there is as a matter of fact a great deal of variability in\ncritical verdicts. But Croce believes this is largely due to variances\nin the \u2018psychological conditions\u2019 and the physical\ncircumstance of spectators (Aes. 124). Much of this can be\noffset by \u2018historical interpretation\u2019 (Aes. 126);\nthe rest, one presumes, are due to disturbances already mentioned:\n\u2018haste, vanity, want of reflexion, theoretic prejudices\u2019\n(Aes. 120). Also one must realize that for Croce, all that\nSibley famously characterized as aesthetic concepts\u2014not just\ngracefulness, delicacy and so on but only aesthetically negative\nconcepts like ugliness\u2014are really variations on the over-arching\nmaster-concept beauty.\n",
