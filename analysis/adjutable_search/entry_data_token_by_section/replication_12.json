    "main_text": "Challenges to the Replicator || Reproducers\n5.4 Reproducers\n\nThe works on the origins of replicators tie in with the notion of\nthe reproducer proposed by Griesemer (2000a,b, 2002, 2005;\nWimsatt & Griesemer 2007), although it was published first, based\non a circulated manuscript by Griesemer, by Szathm\u00e1ry and\nMaynard Smith (1997). A reproducer is an entity that develops and has\na material overlap between the \u201cparent\u201d and\n\u201cprogeny\u201d. This causal relationship between parents and\nprogeny is called \u201cprogeneration\u201d, the \u201cincrease in\nnumerically distinct objects of a given kind\u201d. Reproduction is a\ncomposite process of development and progeneration, leading to objects\nthat are themselves capable of development and progeneration. Thus,\nthe reproducer concept extends the notion of a developmental\nsystem.\n\nHere, inheritance is a system property, not a property of\nparts, unless they are also reproducing systems, and is\ndevelopmentally acquired. Organisms do not arise already capable of\nreproduction in the main, but must undergo orderly transitions before\nthey may reproduce.\n\nThe relation between reproducers, and replicators and interactors,\nvaries according to author. Griesemer treats replication as the\nterminal form of reproduction, once coding mechanisms have been\nevolved, which is itself an evolved form of multiplication (Griesemer\n2000a: 76). Unlike Dawkins\u2019 replicator concept, which Griesemer\nbelieves is based on a similarity relationship of\n\u201ccopying\u201d, a reproducer requires material overlap\nof systems. However, replication arises when material overlap evolves\nprogeneration, and progeneration evolves a codical inheritance system,\nas\n Figure 4\n indicates.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Wimsatt and Griesemer\u2019s\nreproducer concept (Wimsatt & Griesemer 2007, 268).\n\n\nOthers, particularly Jablonka and Lamb (2005, 2007), think that\nreproducers are distinct from replication and that some\nepigenetic inheritance systems are reproducers without being\nreplicators. For them, a reproducer is the \u201ctarget of\nselection\u201d [see the entry on\n inheritance systems].\n\nGodfrey-Smith (2009: 83; see also Okasha 2006: 14) takes issue with\nGriesemer\u2019s requirement of \u201cmaterial overlap\u201d as\nbeing too narrow a definiendum of reproducers. He thinks that\nreproducers need not contribute actual material to their progeny\n(where they template for sequences, as in the case of viruses).\nGriesemer believes Godfrey-Smith has over-interpreted the requirement;\nhe is primarily concerned with the idea that parents cause\nprogeny (Griesemer 2014). Charbonneau (2014) furthers the move made by\nGodfrey-Smith, arguing that the existence of parent-offspring\nlineages is unnecessary for evolution by natural selection to\noccur.\n\nAn aspect of reproducers sensu lato that has fascinated some\nis that it does not imply a particular level of reproduction or\nprogeneration; indeed, Szathm\u00e1ry and Maynard Smith consider\nthat the major transitions of evolution each involve an evolved mode\nof progeneration that is more inclusive or novel than what it evolved\nfrom (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995; Szathm\u00e1ry\n& Maynard Smith 1997).\n\nGodfrey-Smith also proposed a taxonomy of reproducers, dividing them\ninto simple, collective, and scaffolded (Godfrey-Smith\n2009: 87ff). Simple reproducers are\n\n\nentities that can reproduce \u2026 using their own machinery, in\nconjunction with external sources of energy and raw materials.\n\n\nHe gives an example of a bacterial cell. Collective reproducers\n\n\n\u2026 are reproducing entities with parts that themselves have the\ncapacity to reproduce, where the parts do so largely through their own\nresources rather than the coordinated activity as a whole.\n\n\nAnd, scaffolded reproducers\n\n\nare entities which get reproduced as part of the reproduction of some\nlarger unit (a simple reproducer), or that are reproduced by some\nother entity.\n\n\nExamples here includes viruses and chromosomes. Godfrey-Smith applies\nthe scaffolded reproducer category to sociocultural evolution.\n\nThe notion of reproducers has also been applied to speciation and\ncladogenesis (A. Hamilton & Haber 2006). While it may apply to\npopulations, given that taxa do not share the kind of causal unity\nfound in populations and organisms, it is unlikely to apply to species\nor supraspecific taxa, and macroevolution in general.\n\nRecently, Veigl, Suarez, and Stencel (2022) have extended\nGriesemer\u2019s reproducer. In lieu of \u201creproducer\u201d, they\npropose the notion of the \u201creconstitutor\u201d, which is a\nstructure that is \u201cre-produced\u201d at\nevery generation irrespectively of the causal origin of the\nreconstruction. While, as presented above, the idea that\nmaterial overlap is a necessary condition for an entity to\nbe a reproducer and, consequently, to be an entity involved\nin a process of evolution by natural selection seems overly\nrestrictive, the notion proposed by Veigl et al. appears overly\nliberal for at least two reasons. First, without looking\nfor the causal connections between entities involved in\nevolution by natural selection across generations, that is, what\nis transmitted, predicting an evolutionary trajectory at the level of\nthese entities would be difficult. Second, the idea of the\nreconstitutor erases an important distinction made in evolutionary\ntheory between two forms of evolution: namely,\ntransformational and variational evolution (see Lewontin 1983).\nThese two forms of evolution are exemplified by change due\nto mutation and changes due to selection, respectively. The\ndistinction between mutation and selection, along with drift, is\nat the heart of population genetics and general formulations of\nevolutionary theory such as the Price equation (e.g., Frank 2012, who\nemphasize the distinction between \u201cselection\u201d and \u201ctransmission\u201d as\ntwo important and distinct evolutionary processes). To adopt\nthe reconstitutor as a fundamental evolutionary entity would\nrequire extremely strong arguments against the view that mutation and\nselection described at one level are fundamentally different\nevolutionary processes or, at the very least, clear advantages\nfor the notion of the reconstitutor over the reproducer.\n",
