First, in line with\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, it comprises an\nintrinsically anthropological and ethical element; accordingly,\nfalsafa madaniyya is the part of philosophy dedicated to an\ninquiry into the kamal al-insan, the perfection of man, as an\nindividual. Second, just like Plato\u2019s Politeia and\nAristotle\u2019s Politica, it moreover deals with the\nmadina, the polis, as a whole, taking into account\nits makeup and administration. However, it does so strictly from two\nangles: it assesses the madina and its regime with respect to\ntheir success, on the one hand, in guiding citizens towards their\nindividual perfection and, consequently, towards ultimate happiness;\nand on the other hand, in emulating society\u2019s normative model,\nnamely, the cosmic order, through the makeup of the city.\n\nIt is precisely in this connection that religion, milla, as\nal-Farabi views it, has its place. According to him, religion is the\nensemble of beliefs and rules of conduct governing a society. It is\nso-to-speak its ideological and legal constitution designed by its\nfirst ruler to direct its citizens towards human perfection and thus\nto contribute simultaneously to the attainment of individual happiness\nand the well-being of the city. As a consequence, on al-Farabi\u2019s\naccount, religion is essentially an instrument intended for\napplication; it cannot be considered a sphere of knowledge, wisdom,\nand truth on its own. This notion of religion and its place within the\nframe of falsafa madaniyya had a tremendous impact on\nsubsequent thinkers in the Islamic world\u2014such as Ibn Bajja, Ibn\nTufayl, and Ibn Rushd\u2014as well as on the manner in which\nal-Farabi\u2019s thought and, more particularly, what is usually\nreferred to as his \u2018political philosophy\u2019 have been\nassessed in Western historiography. In order to get a clearer idea of\nthese issues, they shall be examined in the sequence just indicated:\nfrom the foundation, al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society\n (section 2),\n across the principle of similitude determining the relation of man,\nsociety, and cosmos\n (section 3),\n towards religion and the art of ruling\n (section 4).\n", "toc": [{"#ConcBack": "1.

Conceptual Background\n\nTo our knowledge, al-Farabi was the first philosopher in the Islamic\nworld who not only displayed a serious interest in philosophy of\nsociety and religion, but also developed a highly differentiated\naccount thereof. He did not, however, start from scratch. At his time,\nthe majority of those philosophical texts which were actually\ntranslated from Greek (mostly through Syriac) into Arabic were\navailable, and al-Farabi was obviously an avid reader of his\npredecessors. Accordingly, his writings display (a) intimate\nfamiliarity with Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics;\n(b) acquaintance with the essentials of Plato\u2019s\nPoliteia (probably mediated by Galen\u2019s\nCompendium; cf. Gutas 2012: 85); and, apparently,\n(c) some knowledge of Aristotle\u2019s Politica, of\nwhich only parts were available in Arabic (Pines 1975).\nAl-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion can be described\nas an intelligent and original synthesis, particularly, of these\noeuvres, a synthesis which shares the late-ancient commentators\u2019\nconcern for harmonizing the positions of Aristotle and Plato.\nMoreover, al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion turns\nout to be a clever adaptation of Greek ethico-political thought to the\nneeds and demands of its new context, the Islamic world of the\n10th century.\n\nAl-Farabi\u2019s Greek heritage is already visible on the most basic\nconceptual level. A society, on his account, is an association of\nhuman beings collaborating \u201c[i]n order to preserve [themselves]\nand to attain [their] highest perfections\u201d (Perfect\nState V, 15, 1: 229). Without collaboration, he insists,\n\u201cman cannot attain the perfection, for the sake of which his\ninborn nature [fitra] has been given to him\u201d (ibid.).\nIn function of their size, associations can or cannot furnish the\nbasis for a \u201cperfect [kamil] society\u201d\n(Perfect State V, 15, 2: 229\u201331). Thus, the smallest\nunit suited to harbor a perfect society is a city (madina).\nSmaller associations, such as villages, quarters, streets, and houses\nare per se imperfect; larger ones, like nations and the\n\u201cunion of all the societies in the inhabitable world\u201d\n(ibid.), by contrast, are perfect.\n\nThe dependence of al-Farabi\u2019s thought thus far, particularly on\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics and Politica is\nobvious. Both the notion that societies only of a certain size can\naccommodate their members independent of external supplies, and the\nidea that human beings strive for some sort of perfection, can be\ntraced back to the Stagirite\u2019s work. Moreover, just like\nAristotle, al-Farabi is convinced that attaining the highest possible\ndegree of perfection entails happiness, a key concept of his thought.\nInspired perhaps by the Politica, he further elaborates on\nthe concept of human perfection: first, he links it with the notion\nthat people live in societies and, second, draws the conclusion that\nthese societies serve a specific purpose, beyond the mere allocation\nof daily needs, such as food, shelter, and protection. Societies have\ntheir own \u2018natural telos\u2019 which consists,\naccording to al-Farabi, in guiding their members towards their end:\ntrue felicity. As a consequence, a city\n\n\n\u2026 in which people aim through association at co-operating for\nthe things by which felicity in its real and true sense can be\nattained, is the excellent city [madina fadila], and the\nsociety in which there is a co-operation to acquire felicity is the\nexcellent society [ijtima\u2018 fadil]. (Perfect\nState V, 15, 3:\n 231)[2]\n\n\n[Unless indicated otherwise, material within square brackets in\nquotations is added by the author of this entry.]\n\nIt is for this reason that society for al-Farabi constitutes an\nindispensable object of philosophical inquiry. Basically, along with\nanthropology (\u2018ilm al-insan, a term al-Farabi himself\noccasionally employs) and cosmology, philosophy of society seeks to\nreveal humanity\u2019s final end as well as the means required to\nachieve this goal (cf. Enumeration 1: 76). Accordingly, this\nnew \u2018discipline\u2019 is the main branch of practical\nphilosophy, centered on some core elements which, therefore, shall be\ndiscussed in more detail in this entry, more precisely: the notions of\nhappiness and the afterlife; the idea of a similitude between society\nand natural organisms as well as the cosmos as a whole; the moral\nobligations, both cognitive and practical, entailed by the natural\ngivens; and the methods of directing the citizens of the madina\nfadila towards their natural telos, the most prominent\nof which being religion.\n2. What is \u2018philosophy of society\u2019?\n2.1 Happiness and the afterlife\n\nIn line with Aristotle, al-Farabi leaves no doubt whatsoever that\nthere is one kind of happiness which constitutes the telos of\nevery human being. Occasionally, he distinguishes between\n\u201cearthly\u201d and \u201cultimate felicity\u201d\n(Attainment i, 1: 13), however, from the majority of his\nwritings it is clear that happiness in the strict sense of the word,\nthat is, as the concomitant of the highest human perfection, is\nultimate\n felicity.[3]\n Yet, in contrast to Aristotle\u2019s notion of eudaimonia,\nal-Farabi\u2019s ultimate happiness is a state associated with the\nafterlife, when, according to his theory of the soul, the soul has\nseparated from the body (see the entry on\n al-Farabi\u2019s psychology).\n The achievement of this state is contingent upon a number of\n preconditions.[4]\n However, before these preconditions can be broached (see\n section 2.2),\n further scrutiny of al-Farabi\u2019s concepts of human perfection\nand the afterlife is required.\n\nHuman perfection is defined by humanity\u2019s place within the\ncosmic order. Prior to death, human beings are hybrids\u2014corporeal\nentities, on the one hand, yet also immaterial, on the other, due to\ntheir intellects, that is, the rational faculty of their souls which\ncan survive death\u2014and as such exposed to two sets of powers.\nJust like every other inhabitant of the sublunary\n world,[5]\n human beings are subject to the natural laws determining corporeal\nsubstances. In contrast, however, to all the other species belonging\nto the sphere of generation and corruption, human beings moreover\nexperience a certain influence by the so-called \u2018active\nintellect\u2019, an immaterial, incorruptible, supralunary entity\nwhose existence is pure\n thinking.[6]\n This active intellect does not affect the body of a human being, but\nrather her intellect and imagination, i.e., those psychic faculties\ninvolved in thinking. The most fundamental influence which the active\nintellect exerts on the human soul consists in, first, the provision\nand, second, the basic \u2018formatting\u2019 of the rational\nfaculty:\n\n\n\u2026 [the active intellect] gives the human being a faculty and a\nprinciple by which to strive, or by which the human being is able to\nstrive on his own for the rest of the perfections that remain for him.\nThat principle is the primary sciences and the primary intelligibles\nattained in the rational part of the soul. (Political Regime\nB, 1, 68: 62)\n\n\nOnly due to these \u201cprimary sciences\u201d and \u201cprimary\nintelligibles\u201d can human beings think in an abstract and\nuniversal fashion and thus acquire knowledge about what there\n is.[7]\n And precisely in the realization of this activity, i.e., thinking,\nand its perfection\u2014ideally, the attainment of its most sublime\nlevel, i.e., science\u2014consists humanity\u2019s telos.\nHuman beings, hence, are born with the natural obligation to perfect\ntheir rational faculty. While they are equipped by the active\nintellect with this faculty and the principles of thought, their task\nconsists in actualizing this potential, i.e., their intellects,\n\u201cby which a human being is a human being\u201d (Political\nRegime A, 2, 8: 32). Becoming an intellect in actuality, just\nlike the active intellect and the other separate intelligences,\ntherefore, constitutes humanity\u2019s perfection. Once a human being\nreaches this level of perfection, she acquires the state of ultimate\nhappiness:\n\n\nWhen the rational faculty attains to being an intellect in actuality,\nthat intellect it now is in actuality also becomes similar to the\nseparate things and it intellects its essence that is [now] intellect\nin actuality. \u2026. Through this, it becomes such as to be in the\nrank of the active intellect. And when a human being obtains this\nrank, his happiness is perfected. (Political Regime A, 2, 8:\n33; square brackets thus in the\n translation)[8]\n\n\nAcross al-Farabi\u2019s various writings, it remains unclear whether\nthis stage of ultimate felicity can already be reached during\none\u2019s lifetime, when the soul is still linked with the human\nbody, or only in the hereafter, once the soul has separated from the\nbody due to this latter\u2019s\n death.[9]\n Still, in striking contrast to Islamic teachings, al-Farabi is\nconvinced that the afterlife is exclusively psychic or rather\nintellectual. In his thought there is no room for corporeal\nresurrection. Instead, the felicity of the hereafter, according to\nhim, means purely intellectual pleasures, a state, however, which\nrequires preparation during one\u2019s lifetime, a state, moreover,\nwhich allows for individual differences. In function of the excellence\nan individual has achieved during her life, the felicity of her\nafterlife will be greater or lesser. This excellence now, on\nal-Farabi\u2019s account, can be measured against a number of\n\u2018natural duties\u2019, prerequisite for the attainment of\nhappiness, but differentiated in accordance with the individual\ncitizens\u2019 natural endowments:\n\n\nThe people of the excellent city have things in common which they all\nperform and comprehend, and other things which each class knows and\ndoes on its own. Each of these people reaches the state of felicity by\nprecisely these two things \u2026. The same is true of the actions\nby which felicity is attained: the more they increase and are repeated\n\u2026, the stronger and more excellent and more perfect becomes the\nsoul \u2026, until it arrives at that stage of perfection in which\nit can dispense with matter so that it becomes independent of it\n \u2026.[10]\n |4: 265| When one generation passes away, their bodies cease to exist\nand their souls are released and become happy and when other people\nsucceed them in their ranks \u2026, they occupy in their turn the\nsame ranks in felicity as those who passed away before, and each joins\nthose who resemble him in species, quantity and quality. \u2026 |5:\n267| The kinds of felicity are unequal in excellence and differ in\nthree ways, in species, quantity and quality \u2026. (Perfect\nState V, 16, 2: 261\u20133; 4: 265; 5:\n 267)[11]\n\n\nTrue individual happiness, as al-Farabi sees it, thus turns out to be\na peculiar blend of Aristotelian, Platonic, and Neoplatonic elements.\nIt simultaneously embraces the idea of the individual felicity\nattained by the philosophers, the notion of a purification and,\nultimately, deification of the human soul, and a theory of intellect\nwhich largely intertwines cosmic and epistemic dimensions. While the\njust-quoted passage from the Perfect State shows that, beyond\nthe knowledge of certain things, particular actions must be performed\nas a precondition for the attainment of individual happiness,\nal-Farabi\u2019s emphasis on cognition cannot be overestimated. For,\nwhatever he has in mind regarding activities, from the above it is\nclear that the human telos is located at the level of\nrationality. Happiness, consequently, consists in the\nas-perfect-as-possible assimilation of the human soul to the active\nintellect, whose unique activity is thinking.\n\nThis being said, a number of questions remain open and must be\naddressed in what follows: first, the things every citizen of the\nmadina is expected to know; second, the role activities play\nin the attainment of individual felicity; and, third, how\nal-Farabi\u2019s just-discussed concept of happiness squares with his\ndistinction between different \u201cclasses\u201d of citizens as\nwell as various degrees of felicity.\n2.2 The preconditions of happiness\n\nAs the last citation from the Perfect State conveys, when\ndiscussing the preconditions of felicity, al-Farabi distinguishes\nbetween (a) common and (b) specific duties of the\ncitizens, as well as between (i) knowledge and (ii)\nactivities. His most detailed indications concerning these\npreconditions address (a.i) the common things that everyone\nmust know and are spelled out in the following list:\n\n\nThe things in common which all the people of the excellent city ought\nto know are: (1) In the first place to know the First Cause and all\nits qualities; (2) then the immaterial existents [including the above\nmentioned active intellect] \u2026; (3) the celestial substances\n\u2026; (4) [without number in Walzer\u2019s translation] then the\nnatural bodies which are beneath them, and how they come to be and\npass away \u2026; (5) then the generation of man; (6) then the first\nruler \u2026; (7) then the rulers who have to take his place\n\u2026; (8) then the excellent city and its people and the felicity\nwhich their souls ultimately reach \u2026. (Perfect State\nV, 17, 1: 277\u20139)\n\n\nFrom this list it follows that al-Farabi presupposes a quite profound\nknowledge of cosmology, physics, anthropology, and philosophy of\nsociety. This is rather astounding in view of the fact that, as he\nhimself admits, only a minority of people are sufficiently gifted\nintellectually to do science, which is to say, to understand those\nthings al-Farabi mentions in his\n list.[12]\n This raises the question of whether or not felicity is in effect\nattainable by everyone, a question that will be pursued in\n section 3.2\n of this entry. Regarding the preconditions of happiness, however, it\ncan be concluded that, as far as the common knowledge requirements\n(a.i) are concerned, al-Farabi sets the bar fairly high: only\naccomplished philosophers will be able to fulfill these criteria.\n\nAs for the remaining preconditions, al-Farabi is far less explicit.\nThere are some indications regarding the common activities\n(a.ii). It appears that, once again in unison with Aristotle,\nthese embrace all sorts of exercises suited to purify one\u2019s soul\nwhile it is still unified with \u2018its\u2019 body, as\nal-Farabi\u2019s references to the soul\u2019s disposition as well\nas his recurrent comparisons with arts and crafts suggest. Thus, he\nintimates, in connection with the last quoted passage:\n\n\nWhen each of [the people of the excellent city] acts in this way\n[i.e., according to the citizens\u2019 common duties], these actions\nof his make him acquire a good and excellent disposition of the soul,\nand the more steadily he applies himself to them, the stronger and\nbetter becomes that disposition of this and increases in strength and\nexcellence\u2014just as steadily applying himself to performing the\nactions of writing well make a man acquire proficiency in the art of\nwriting \u2026. (Perfect State V, 16, 2: 261)\n\n\nIn the background of this notion of acquiring a better psychic\ndisposition by virtue of repeatedly performing certain activities, is\n(in addition to Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics) the\nancient medical tradition. Accordingly, even the (immaterial) rational\nfaculty of the soul can be positively affected, if those faculties of\nthe soul which operate by virtue of corporeal organs (such as sense\nperception and imagination) are improved. This concerns, at the most\nbasic level, the mixture of the temperaments, which is directly\nrelated to the nutritive faculty: the better one\u2019s temperaments\nare in balance, the fewer are the negative influences by the body on\nthe soul, and the more easily this human being will, hence, be able to\nuse her rational faculty. On a slightly more complex level, this idea\nof balance or harmony as a means to purify the soul also concerns the\nrealm of moral virtues. For while one\u2019s character is\nfundamentally predisposed by her temperament, al-Farabi maintains that\nvirtues can be trained and improved. Thus, just as keeping the bodily\nhumors in check, being able to find the \u2018golden mean\u2019 in\nethical matters usually prepares the ground for a swifter and less\ndistracted application of one\u2019s rational\n faculty.[13]\n\nThat al-Farabi in fact envisages moral virtues as one of the\npreconditions of individual happiness, is further corroborated by his\nassessment of deficient cities and societies. Among these communities\nare the \u201cimmoral cities\u201d whose inhabitants, despite\nknowing better, \u201cthrough their passion and will [are] inclined\ntoward\u201d what al-Farabi considers to be wrong or presumed goods,\nsuch as \u201cstatus, honor, domination\u201d (Political\nRegime C, 3, 120: 90; cf. also Book of Religion 11:\n101), which distract from humanity\u2019s natural telos.\nOther examples of misguided ambitions include the quest for \u201cthe\nenjoyment of pleasures\u201d imagined to be found in gluttony,\ndrinking, and sexual intercourse (Political Regime C, 3, 119:\n89). Al-Farabi\u2019s verdict regarding these communities is\nunambiguous: \u201cNo one at all among the inhabitants of these\ncities gains happiness\u201d (ibid. 120: 90). As these examples and\nal-Farabi\u2019s assessment evince, just like the balance of\none\u2019s temperaments, her character is significant in the pursuit\nof happiness not for its own sake, but insofar as it fulfills a\npreparatory task. It prepares the human being\u2019s soul so that it\ncan, to the best of its ability, perform its proper activity, i.e.,\nreasoning.\n\nRegarding, finally, those things which citizens are supposed to know\nand do in accordance with their respective classes (referred to as\n b.i and b.ii above,\n first paragraph of this section), al-Farabi seems to think of the\nvarious trades and professions performed in the\n polis.[14]\n As the next section will reveal, he differentiates between the\nindividual skills and weaknesses with which each human being is born.\nHe is convinced that, equipped with these specific talents, each human\nbeing possesses her natural place and duty within society. Actualizing\nher individual potential to the best of her capacities, hence,\ncontributes to the functioning and well-being of the community. This,\nin fact, does not immediately lead towards individual happiness, but\nis a necessary precondition as it contributes to covering the daily\nneeds and, thus, warranting the basis for society to aspire for its\nown natural telos (see\n section 1\n above).\n3. The principle of similitude\n3.1 Being: man, society, cosmos\n\nAl-Farabi\u2019s notion of ultimate felicity has tremendous impact on\nhis philosophy of society. In the light of humanity\u2019s particular\ntelos, a society can be \u201cexcellent\n(fadil)\u201d, in the sense introduced\n above,[15]\n if and only if its cooperation pursues society\u2019s natural\ntelos, i.e., if it seeks to equip its members with the\nnecessary means for the attainment of individual happiness. Therefore,\nthe primary goal of governing a society must consist in providing the\nmeans so that everyone can acquire theoretical\n knowledge,[16]\n learn about her natural duties, and put them into practice. In order\nto explain his notion of the excellent society, al-Farabi falls back\non two recurrent examples, natural organisms and the cosmos. At first\nglance, this comparison might appear inappropriate, linking voluntary\nbehavior in the case of human beings and society with the strictly\nnatural and causal processes characterizing the functioning of\norganisms and the cosmos as a whole. However, al-Farabi\u2019s aim is\nnot to deny the distinction between the voluntary and the\nnatural\u2014quite the contrary.\n\nWhile human beings, on his account, are in fact endowed with free will\nand, hence, can organize their own lives as well as their communities\nad\n libitum,[17]\n there is, as seen above, a natural norm for humanity distinguishing\nthe good life from the bad life and, in terms of eschatology, the\nattainment of happiness from failure to do so. In this sense,\nal-Farabi clearly subscribes to what nowadays would be called a\nnatural law ethics. And it is precisely at this level that his two\nexamples, organisms and the cosmos, come into play and lend his\nnotions of society and happiness a conspicuously Platonic flavor. In\nal-Farabi\u2019s view, organisms and the cosmos are the perfect\nmodels which human beings\u2014for themselves as well as for their\nsocial lives\u2014are well advised to emulate:\n\n\nBoth the city and the household have an analogy with the body of the\nhuman being. The body is composed of different parts \u2026, each\ndoing a certain action, so that from all their actions they come\ntogether in mutual assistance to perfect the purpose of the human\nbeing\u2019s body. In the same way, both the city and the household\nare composed of different parts of a definite number \u2026, each\nperforming on its own a certain action, so that from their actions\nthey come together in mutual assistance to perfect the purpose of the\ncity or the household. (Selected Aphorisms 25: 23)\n\n\nEssentially, al-Farabi applies Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nergon to the cosmos and each of its members. Accordingly, the\ncosmos as such is not only determined by a certain order, it actually\nrepresents the best of all possible structures, as it is the effect of\nthe over-perfect first\n cause.[18]\n Consequently, every part of the cosmos possesses a specific function\nwhich it must perform in order to keep the perpetuum mobile\ncosmos running smoothly, without interruptions and disturbances. While\neverything else executes its function by nature, human beings,\nequipped with reason and free will, must choose to do so. Therefore,\nthey must understand the cosmic order and their own place and duty, or\nrather ergon, in the frame of this all-embracing structure,\nwhich, once again, underscores the significance attached to knowledge\nin al-Farabi\u2019s thought.\n\nAnd yet, the implications of the two paradigmatic examples, organisms\nand the cosmos, reach further, inasmuch as both examples represent\ncomplex entities with a diversified internal makeup. Granted, every\nelement of the cosmos or an organism in general contributes to the\nwell-being of the whole, nonetheless, each one has its peculiar\nactivity. The heart, for instance, is in charge of pumping the blood\nthrough the blood vessels and thus keeping the body alive, whereas the\nkidneys are responsible for filtering the blood and regulating water\nfluid levels. Similarly, al-Farabi gives to understand that each human\nbeing has a particular task within the framework of society, in view\nof her specific skills (cf. above,\n section 2.2,\n regarding the citizens\u2019 specific knowledge and activities\n [b.i and b.ii]):\n\n\nThe excellent city resembles the perfect and healthy body, all of\nwhose limbs co-operate \u2026. Now the limbs and organs of the body\nare different and their natural endowments and faculties are unequal\nin excellence, there being among them one ruling organ, namely the\nheart, and organs which are close in rank to that ruling organ\n\u2026. The same holds good in the case of the city. Its parts are\ndifferent by nature, and their natural dispositions are unequal in\nexcellence: there is in it a man who is the ruler, and there are\nothers whose ranks are close to the ruler, each of them with a\ndisposition and a habit through which he performs an action \u2026.\n(Perfect State V, 15, 4: 231\u20133)\n\n\nThis analogy constitutes the core of al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of\nsociety, creating, however, several remarkable tensions within his\nthought. Thus, as seen above, in the vein of Aristotle, he maintains\nthat humanity\u2019s specific difference is rationality and that the\nnatural telos of every human being consists in perfecting\nthis feature. Meanwhile, he also holds that human beings differ with\nregard to their natural endowments. Accordingly, some are highly\nintelligent, while others are not. Some have the potential to become\nphilosophers and recognize the makeup of the world, happiness, and the\nnatural norm encapsulated in these ontological givens;\nothers\u2014actually the majority, as al-Farabi believes\u2014do not\npossess these capacities. This raises the two interrelated questions\nof, first, how these individuals can nevertheless attain felicity, if\nat all; and, second, how society must be set up in order to achieve\nits own natural telos and offer each member an equal\nopportunity for attaining individual happiness.\n3.2 Knowing: things versus symbolic representations\n\nIn order to approach these questions, it is imperative to have a\ncloser look at al-Farabi\u2019s anthropology (\u2018ilm\nal-insan) which represents the backbone of his philosophy of\nsociety and religion. In line with the Greek medical tradition,\nparticularly Galen, al-Farabi is convinced that individual natural\nendowments depend chiefly on two factors, first, the region of the\nworld in which one happens to be born and, second, one\u2019s bodily\nconstitution, i.e., the body\u2019s concrete mixture of elements (cf.\nabove,\n section 2.2).[19]\n For although the human soul as such is immaterial, so long as it is\ncoupled with \u2018its\u2019 body, it depends for its activities\n(including, in a way, thinking) on corporeal organs like the external\nsenses, allowing for sense perception and imagination. Notably,\none\u2019s temperament or natural disposition\u2014determining\nprimarily those processes which can be associated with moods,\nemotions, and, in general, character traits\u2014thus turns out to be\nthe limiting factor defining whether a human being will be\nsharp-witted or rather dull and, hence, able to perfect for herself\nhumanity\u2019s specific ergon, i.e., reasoning.\n\nWhile at first glance this seems to imply natural predestination,\nproviding the happy few, on the one hand, with the means to attain\neudaimonia, but dooming the unfortunate many, on the other,\nto misery, al-Farabi insists that every human being is equipped with\nthe necessary requirements to attain ultimate felicity, even those\nwhose natural disposition does not allow them to become philosophers.\nFor, according to him, people\n\n\n\u2026 whose innate character is sound share in an innate character\nthat disposes them to receive the intelligibles in which they all\nshare and by which they strive toward objects and actions common to\nall of them. Then, afterward, they diverge and differ, thereby coming\nto an innate character that is particular to each one of them and to\neach group. So one among them is disposed to receive certain other\nintelligibles that are not shared, but are particular to him \u2026.\n(Political Regime B, 1, 74: 65)\n\n\nAccordingly, provided one is not born a fool or a madman but a\ncompos\n mentis,[20]\n every human being has the means to \u201cstrive toward objects and\nactions common to all\u201d. These objects and actions common to all,\nmeanwhile, along with \u201cother things which each class knows and\ndoes on its own\u201d (Perfect State V, 16, 2: 261)\nprecisely correspond to the prerequisites for the attainment of\nhappiness discussed above, in\n section 2.2.\n However, as likewise seen above, these prerequisites, and\nparticularly those things which all human beings ought to know, set\nfairly high intellectual standards. Nonetheless, according to\nal-Farabi, the requirement of knowing these common objects does not\nexclude anyone from attaining happiness, because they\n\n\n\u2026 can be known in two ways, either by being impressed on [the\npeople\u2019s] souls as they really are or by being impressed on them\nthrough affinity and symbolic representation. (Perfect State\nV, 17, 2: 279)\n\n\nEvery human being, thus, can attain the individual felicity of the\n hereafter,[21]\n provided, that is, that she learns about the common objects in one of\nthese two ways. It is the duty of society or, more precisely, of the\nruler of the excellent city to ensure that everyone is taught these\nthings according to her capacities. In this connection, now, as will\nbe discussed in\n section 4,\n religion as the \u2018art of persuasion\u2019 has its specific\nplace and significance. Concerning al-Farabi\u2019s notion of\nsociety, however, it is important to note that the chief duty ascribed\nhere to society and the excellent city has notable implications for\nthe nature of its government. Government, as can now be concluded and\nis corroborated by various passages throughout al-Farabi\u2019s\n oeuvre,[22]\n must primarily be described as \u2018offering guidance\u2019,\n\u2018teaching\u2019, or \u2018habituating\u2019.\n\nAt this point, the second aspect mentioned above, i.e., the\n\u201cinnate character that is particular to each [individual] and to\neach group\u201d must be further elucidated (cf. the first quote in\nthis section). Human beings, as noted before, have the same\nrelationship to society as organs to the body. Owing to their\nparticular \u201cinnate character\u201d or specific natural\ndisposition, they hold a particular natural place within the\n\u2018organism society\u2019, with a specific ergon they\nought to perform, so that the entire \u2018body\u2019 can function\nwell. Consequently, human beings not only have a natural duty towards\nthemselves, entailing individual felicity, but also towards society\nand, even beyond, the cosmic order as a whole, contributing both to\nthe proper functioning of their society and to the happiness of the\n\u2018organism cosmos\u2019 and its various\n parts.[23]\n Hence, in correspondence with the particular trades and professions\nimplied by the members\u2019 individual skills, society is structured\nby nature in an at once organic and hierarchical fashion:\n\n\nThe ruling organ in the body is by nature the most perfect and most\ncomplete of the organs in itself and in its specific qualification\n\u2026; beneath it, in turn, are other organs which rule over organs\ninferior to them \u2026; they rule and are ruled. In the same way,\nthe ruler of the city is the most perfect part of the city in his\nspecific qualification and has the best of everything which anybody\nelse shares with him; beneath him are people who are ruled by him and\nrule others. (Perfect State V, 15, 5: 235)\n\n\nThe natural hierarchy underlying a well-ordered society is spelled out\nin terms of al-Farabi\u2019s distinction between ruling and serving\nfunctions. In the excellent city, itself the perfect image of a\nnatural body as well as the cosmos as a whole, the criterion for\nrulership, in the vein of Plato\u2019s Politeia, is\nintelligence and wisdom. This is to say that there is a ruler by\nnature who distinguishes herself by her intimate understanding of the\ncosmic order, its normative implications, human nature, and how to\nrealize the discovered normative implications in view of the diverse\ntalents and limitations determining the citizens\u2019 \u201cinnate\ncharacters\u201d. Ruling the city, as was already stated before,\nconsists in providing precisely this kind of guidance: actualizing the\nvarious potentials in a well-coordinated manner which faithfully\nresembles the functioning of organisms, and thus seeking to facilitate\nevery citizen\u2019s pursuit of\n happiness.[24]\n\nThe excellent ruler, as can now be inferred, is not only the most\naccomplished philosopher possessing a comprehensive theoretical\nknowledge of all there\n is.[25]\n She is also and particularly the one who is able to ensure, first,\nthat every citizen is taught the things they need to do and to know,\nthus inducing individual felicity; and, second, that everyone is\ninstructed in and carries out those \u201cthings which each class\nknows and does on its own\u201d (Perfect State V, 16, 2:\n261; cf. also Political Regime B, 2, 78: 68), in this manner\nsimultaneously bringing about the well-being of the city and\ncontributing to the happiness of the organism cosmos. With this\nbackground, al-Farabi\u2019s account of religion, i.e., the art of\npersuasion or of teaching by virtue of \u201caffinities and symbolic\nrepresentations\u201d can be addressed.\n4. Religion and the art of ruling\n4.1 What is \u2018religion\u2019?\n\n\nReligion is opinions and actions, determined and restricted with\nstipulations and prescribed for a community by their first ruler, who\nseeks to obtain through their practicing it a specific purpose with\nrespect to them or by means of them. \u2026. If the first ruler is\nexcellent and his rulership truly excellent, then in what he\nprescribes he seeks only to obtain, for himself and for everyone under\nhis rulership, the ultimate happiness that is truly happiness; and\nthat religion will be the excellent religion. (Book of\nReligion 1: 93, slightly modified)\n\n\nAs this quotation amply evinces, al-Farabi has a fairly peculiar\nnotion of religion. First, it embraces \u201copinions\u201d and\n\u201cactions\u201d and, hence, those two elements which, as seen\nabove\n (section 2.2),\n play a significant role in connection with the attainment of\nindividual felicity. Accordingly, human beings need to know certain\nthings (in one of the two mentioned ways) and perform certain actions\nin order to become truly happy. Second, religion is described as the\nresult of a first ruler\u2019s activities. More precisely, this ruler\nis depicted as the one who first established the opinions and actions\nto be held and performed by the community she\n rules.[26]\n Furthermore, in so doing she pursued a specific purpose. In other\nwords, these opinions and actions are supposed to be defended and\ncarried out, not for their own sake, but\u2014provided \u201cthe\nfirst ruler is excellent\u201d\u2014for the sake of ultimate\nhappiness. Religion, therefore, is not a goal in and of itself; it is\nan instrument, more specifically, it is an instrument of\n rulership.[27]\n\nAt first glance, al-Farabi\u2019s concept of religion may appear as\ndepreciative, particularly from the perspective of existing religions,\nsuch as Islam. He bluntly denies religion the status of an autonomous\nsphere of knowledge and wisdom; he rejects its claim to exclusive\ntruth; and he reduces it to a mere tool. However, these features\ncannot be assessed tel quel, but require their specific\ncontext, namely, al-Farabi\u2019s basic ontological and\nepistemological views. According to him, the givens of\nreality\u2014the things constituting reality, their behavior, and the\nunderlying natural laws\u2014are the effects of certain primary\nprinciples, such as intelligence, soul, and matter, which are\nultimately all founded in a single, first cause (cf. above,\n section 2.1).[28]\n These facts now, on al-Farabi\u2019s account, can be known by human\nbeings, just as the moral obligations they entail (as discussed above,\n section 3.1).\n Accordingly, there is one objective reality and, epistemologically,\none objectively true account of it. There are, however, several\nmethods for appropriating this true account and, in turn, imparting it\nto others, namely, \u201ceither \u2026 as [these things] really are\nor \u2026 through affinity and symbolic representation\u201d\n (section 3.2).\n\nPrecisely this latter method of symbolic representation is identified\nwith religion, while its counterpart, teaching and knowing things as\nthey \u201creally are\u201d, corresponds to philosophy. Doubtlessly,\nphilosophy is therefore superior to religion, as is often underscored\nby scholarship and acknowledged by al-Farabi himself (cf. Book of\nReligion 5: 97\u20138). This superiority, however, concerns only\nthe respective epistemic levels. While \u2018philosophy\u2019 is the\nname of a knowledge based on demonstration and resulting in objective\ncertitude, \u2018religion\u2019 is the name for a knowledge based on\ndialectical and rhetorical means and resulting only in probable\nopinion and\n conviction.[29]\n From a pragmatic point of view, by contrast, the coordinate system\nshifts considerably. From this angle, it is religion which turns out\nto be no less important than philosophy, due to the givens of\nanthropology: for by far the majority of people depend on\n\u201csymbolic representation\u201d as the avenue to the knowledge\nand activities required for the attainment of felicity, while only a\nminority can grasp the things as they \u201creally are\u201d.\n\nThe relation of religion to philosophy, therefore, is like the\nrelation of human beings to organisms, and of society to the cosmos:\nthat of similitude\u2014provided, that is, it is an excellent\n religion.[30]\n It is a similitude of philosophy in various respects, on the one\nhand, concerning its immanent structure, on the other, regarding its\nmode of operation. Just like philosophy, it embraces a body of\ntheoretical knowledge (a creed) from which it derives practical rules\n(the law); and just like philosophy, its principal purpose consists in\nteaching and, thus, providing a means of governance to the ruler. From\nthis particular setting it can be concluded that what religion\nteaches, or rather, what the ruler teaches by virtue of religion, is a\nmetaphorical account of what philosophy presents scientifically. This\nis already conspicuous, for example, in the way al-Farabi presents the\ntheoretical doctrines (creed) conveyed by religion:\n\n\nAmong the theoretical [things taught by the excellent religion] are\nthose that describe God, may He be exalted. Then there are some that\ndescribe the spiritual beings, their ranks in themselves, their\nstations in relation to God, may He be exalted \u2026. (Book of\nReligion 2: 94)\n\n\nEven without presenting the entire list, it is obvious that al-Farabi\nrefers to the same issues as those detailed in his Perfect\nState (see\n section 2.2\n above). However, while the Perfect State employed a\nterminology reminiscent of philosophical jargon, the Book of\nReligion falls back on religious terms. Instead of the first\ncause, it speaks of God; instead of cosmology, it refers to theology;\ninstead of the separate intellects, it evokes angels and demons as\nspiritual beings. The same kind of shift can be observed in connection\nwith the activities the excellent religion determines (law):\n\n\nAs for actions, they are, first of all, the actions and speeches by\nwhich God is praised and extolled. Then there are those that praise\nthe spiritual beings and the angels. Then there are those that praise\nthe prophets, the most excellent kings, the righteous rulers, and the\nleaders of the right way who have gone before. (Book of\nReligion 3: 96, slightly modified)\n\n\nOnce again, already the formulas used by al-Farabi to indicate the\ntype of activities determined by religion, without giving a single\nexample, evoke associations with existing religions, particularly,\nIslam. Thus, with God\u2019s praise one will easily connect the five\ndaily prayers demanded of Muslims; the \u201cprophets\u201d,\n\u201crighteous rulers\u201d, and \u201cleaders of the right\nway\u201d are reminiscent of the prophet Mu\u1e25ammad and his\npredecessors; of the first four caliphs; and of either the imams of\nShi\u2018ism or other spiritual leaders of Islam (e.g., sufis).\n\nNotably, in light of the above\n (section 2.2),\n it is evident that a religion\u2019s holy scripture, like the\nQur\u2019an, serves two functions\u2014provided that the respective\nreligion fulfills the excellence criterion. With regard to the\ndoctrines it imparts, it offers a similitude of the objects people\nactually ought to know in order to achieve their natural\n telos.[31]\n As to its practical implications, i.e., the rites and norms it\nconveys, it executes the aforementioned preparatory function: it\ntrains the faithful in a behavior which is suited to foster exactly\nthe same moral virtues as those addressed by the Nicomachean\nEthics and referred to by al-Farabi himself: virtues which\nimprove the soul\u2019s disposition so as to realize, to the best of\none\u2019s capacities, its natural\n ergon.[32]\n4.2 Religion and rulership\n\nThe natural ruler of the excellent city, nation, or \u201cunion of\nall the societies in the inhabitable world\u201d\n (section 2.1,\n first quotation) is, against the backdrop of al-Farabi\u2019s\nphilosophy of society and religion, someone who is at once an\naccomplished philosopher, prophet, supreme ruler, lawgiver, and imam.\nShe truly understands reality and its underlying principles and is\nable to verify her knowledge demonstratively. However, she also has\nthe ability to \u2018translate\u2019 her knowledge into metaphors\nand symbolic representations and present them, by means of rhetorical\ndevices, in a convincing\n fashion.[33]\n From the perspective of the majority of people, this metaphorical\naccount appears to be some sort of supernatural, divine revelation. In\na way, it is certainly \u2018divine\u2019, given al-Farabi\u2019s\ncosmology. However, from the perspective of philosophy, it is clearly\nnot supernatural; it is merely a symbolic representation faithfully\nencapsulating the essentials of metaphysics, natural philosophy,\nanthropology, and philosophy of\n society.[34]\n\nReligion, embracing a doctrinal as well as a legal branch, is thus the\nmost important element of rulership. It is an enterprise that must be\ncarried on beyond the death of the first ruler, fostered and further\ndeveloped by subsequent rulers and those savants who in a given\nsociety are situated fairly high in the natural hierarchy, being\nintelligent and erudite themselves, and thus \u2018naturally\u2019\nin charge of disseminating the knowledge required for happiness. In\nparticular, those actions which the first ruler, for whatever reason,\ndid not determine, will have to be legislated at some\n point.[35]\n Notably, even though the supposed similitude of society with the\ncosmos, as well as al-Farabi\u2019s own parlance, suggest that the\n\u2018natural\u2019 form of government would be a monarchy, he\nremains fairly noncommittal on this\n topic.[36]\n\nObviously, if there is at a given time in a given society a human\nbeing unifying the required qualities, she will be the natural leader.\nAnd in agreement with Plato\u2019s Politeia, al-Farabi seems\nto believe that the founding act of creating a religion suited to\nserve as the \u2018constitution\u2019 of an excellent\npolis, presupposes a single, first ruler acting as the\noriginal lawgiver. However, if subsequently there is nowhere in the\nmadina a single person incorporating these qualities, several\npeople with complementary properties should team up and henceforth\nguide the community. This clearly exhibits that al-Farabi was not\nparticularly interested in concrete political structures and systems.\nHis attention, instead, was directed towards the metaphysical\nprinciples underlying human associations and their normative\nimplications.\n\nThis peculiar stance is clearly displayed in al-Farabi\u2019s\ndiscussion of deficient cities and societies. While the details differ\nacross his various treatises dedicated to this topic, the scale by\nmeans of which he assesses \u2018excellence\u2019 and\n\u2018deficiency\u2019 is consistently those two factors identified\nabove: knowledge and action, on both the common and the class-related\nlevels. Thus, for instance, in the Political Regime he\ndistinguishes six deficient forms of cities, among which he lists the\n\u201cnecessary societies\u201d (Political Regime C, 2, 93:\n76, substituting \u2018societies\u2019 for\n\u2018associations\u2019). This kind of society or city, he\nexplains,\n\n\n\u2026 is the one in which there is mutual assistance for earning\nwhat is necessary to constitute and safeguard bodies. \u2026. Among\nthe necessary cities, there may be some that bring together all of the\narts that procure what is necessary. Their ruler is the one who has\nfine governance and excellent stratagems for using [the citizens] so\nthat they gain the necessary things and fine governance in preserving\nthese things for them or who bestows these things on them from what he\nhas. (Political Regime C, 2, 94: 77)\n\n\nAt first glance, this seems just fine and precisely what good\nrulership ought to accomplish. All the trades and professions required\nfor the polis to subsist are extant. The ruler is by no means\na tyrant exploiting her subjects, but rather excels in helping them to\ngain these goods, preserving them and distributing them among the\nlatter. Nevertheless, what is deficient in this type of society is\nadumbrated in the first phrase of the quote: the mutual cooperation\ndescribed here is directed exclusively towards the well-being of\nbodies. It thus neglects society\u2019s proper purpose, namely, the\npromotion of humanity\u2019s natural telos, which certainly\npresupposes but cannot be reduced to well-functioning bodies.\n\nSociety, according to al-Farabi, as can be deduced from these\nobservations, ought to be a joint venture, grounded in the true\nunderstanding of reality and its principles, and guided by a religion\nwhich translates this understanding, first, into generally\ncomprehensible doctrines, i.e., similitudes, and, second, activities\nsuited to purify and prepare the citizens\u2019 souls in their quest\nfor felicity. Thus, it clearly ought to transcend the mere\nsatisfaction of daily needs and wants. Therefore, al-Farabi\nconcludes,\n\n\n\u2026 the first ruler of the excellent city must already have\nthorough cognizance of theoretical philosophy; for he cannot\nunderstand anything pertaining to God\u2019s, may He be exalted,\ngovernance of the world so as to follow it except from that source. It\nis clear, in addition, that all of this is impossible unless there is\na common religion in the cities that brings together their opinions,\nbeliefs, and actions; that renders their divisions harmonious, linked\ntogether, and well ordered; and at that point they will support one\nanother in their actions and assist one another to reach the purpose\nthat is sought after, namely, ultimate happiness. (Book of\nReligion 27: 113, slightly modified)\n\n5. Final remarks\n\nPhilosophy and religion turn out to possess a fairly peculiar relation\nto one another in al-Farabi\u2019s thought. Philosophy, or rather\nmetaphysics, is the only way to advance to the most profound\nexplanation of all there is as well as humanity\u2019s natural duties\nentailed by the natural givens. Accordingly, an excellent philosopher\ncan do without religion in her pursuit of happiness. Religion,\nhowever, cannot do without philosophy and, a fortiori,\nneither can society. In view of what is at stake in the case of\nfailure to grasp and convey the truth, the pressure put on philosophy\nand, to some lesser extent, on religion in this theory is enormous.\nSociety cannot fulfill its ergon without either philosophy or\nreligion, nor without a government conscientiously imparting the\ntheoretical and practical duties; with the consequence that, apart\nfrom a few \u2018born\u2019 philosophers, human beings will fail to\nattain individual felicity.\n\nWhile these are serious threats on the practical level, it appears\nthat as far as the underlying anthropology is concerned, al-Farabi\nendorses a profoundly optimistic view. He is convinced that everything\nwhich needs to be known and done to reach individual happiness is\nattainable by virtue of humanity\u2019s natural endowments. As such,\nthere is no need for revelation of a supernatural kind. Instead, as\nal-Farabi gives to understand, there is plenty of evidence to be found\nin reality and its principles, which teach humanity about happiness.\nThere are, furthermore, abundant models, ranging from the cosmic order\nto the makeup of the most primitive organisms, which need only be\nemulated to guide humanity towards its final goal. And, last but not\nleast, there are philosophers who discovered and understood these\nnatural givens and implications already centuries\n ago.[37]\n Hence, the only thing that remains to be done, on his account, is to\nput these insights into practice.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature in English Translation", "Secondary Literature in Western Languages"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature in English Translation": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, <em>Attainment [of Happiness]</em>, in\nAlfarabi, 1962, <em>Philosophy of Plato and Aristotle</em>, trans.\nwith an intro. by M.
