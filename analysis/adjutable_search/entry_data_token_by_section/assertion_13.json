    "main_text": "Normative Accounts, Content-Directed || Conventions\n5.2 Conventions\n\nAustin held that illocutionary acts as opposed to perlocutionary acts\nare conventional, in the sense that they can be made explicit\nby the so-called performative formula (Austin 1962: 103). According to\nAustin, one can say \u201cI argue that\u201d or \u201cI warn you\nthat\u201d but not \u201cI convince you that\u201d or \u201cI\nalarm you that\u201d. Presumably, the idea was that a speech act type\nis conventional just if there exists a convention by which an\nutterance of a sentence of a certain kind ensures (if uptake is\nsecured) that a speech act of that type is performed. Austin probably\nthought that in virtue of the performative formulas this condition is\nmet by illocutionary but not by perlocutionary act types.\n\nThe more general claim that illocutionary force is correlated by\nconvention with sentence type has been advocated by Dummett (1973\n[1981: 302, 311]). On this view, it is a convention that declarative\nsentences are used for assertion, interrogative for questions and\nimperative for commands and requests. Similar views have been put\nforward by Searle (1969) and Kot\u2019\u00e1tko (1998), and the\nidea has been more recently defended by K\u00f6lbel (2010). According\nto Searle (1969: 38, 40), illocutionary acts are conventional, and the\nconventions in question govern the use of so-called force-indicating\ndevices (Searle 1969: 64) specific to each\n language.[31]\n\nHowever, the view that illocutionary acts types are conventional in\nthis sense has met with much opposition. Strawson (1964:\n153\u2013154) objected early on that ordinary illocutionary acts can\nbe performed without relying on any convention to identify the force,\nfor instance when using a declarative sentence like \u201cThe ice\nover there is very thin\u201d for a warning. This kind of criticism,\ndirected against Dummett, has later been reinforced by Robert J.\nStainton (1996, 2006), stressing that in appropriate contexts,\nsub-sentential phrases like \u201cJohn\u2019s father\u201d\n(pointing at a man) or \u201cvery fast\u201d (looking at a car) can\nbe used to make assertions, and gives linguistic arguments why not all\nsuch uses can be treated as cases of ellipsis (that is, as cases of\nleaving out parts of a well-formed sentence that speaker and hearer\ntacitly aware of). If Strawson and Stainton are right, convention\nisn\u2019t necessary for making assertions.\n\nMoreover, Davidson (1979, 1984) stressed that no conventional sign\ncould work as a force indicator in this sense, since any conventional\nsign could be used (and would be used) in insincere utterances, where\nthe corresponding force was missing, including cases of deception,\njokes, impersonation and other theatrical performances. Basically the\nsame point is made by Bach and Harnish (1979: 122\u2013127). If\nDavidson, and Bach and Harnish are right, then conventions are also\nnot sufficient (but see K\u00f6lbel 2010 for an argument against this\nview).\n\nWilliamson (1996, 239) has argued that that speech acts defined by\nconstitutive rules (like assertion, in his own view) cannot be\nconventional. However, Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2019) has shown that\nthis position is controversial. The situation is complicated by the\nfact that the general question of when a convention, or rule of any\nkind, is in force for a speaker, is substantial and complex\n(for more on the relation of assertion to convention, Green\n2020a).\n",
