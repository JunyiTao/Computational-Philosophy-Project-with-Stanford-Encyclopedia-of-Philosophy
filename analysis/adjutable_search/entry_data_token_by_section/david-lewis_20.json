    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience || Counterparts or Double Lives?\n6.4 Counterparts or Double Lives?\n\nThe last chapter of Plurality changes tack somewhat. Instead\nof focussing on different ways the world could be, Lewis\u2019s focus\nbecomes different ways things could be. The chapter defends, and\nexpands upon, Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory.\n\nCounterpart theory was first introduced by Lewis in \u201cCounterpart\nTheory and Quantified Modal Logic\u201d (1968) as a way of making\nmodal discourse extensional. Instead of worrying just what a name\ninside the scope of a modal operator might mean, we translate the\nlanguage of quantified modal logic into a language without operators,\nbut with quantifiers over worlds and other non-actual individuals. So\ninstead of saying \u25a1Fa, we say\n\u2200w\u2200x ((Ww \u2227 Ixw\n\u2227 Cxa) \u2283 Fx). That is, for all w\nand x, if w is a world, and x is in\nw, and x is a counterpart of a, then\nFx. Or, more intuitively, all of a\u2019s\ncounterparts are F. The paper shows how we can extend this\nintuitive idea into a complete translation from the language of\nquantfied modal logic to the language of counterpart theory. In\n\u201cTensions\u201d (1974a) Lewis retracts the claim that it is an\nadvantage of counterpart theory over quantified modal logic that it is\nextensional rather than intensional, largely because he finds the\ndistinction between these two notions much more elusive than he had\nthought. But he still thought counterpart theory had a lot of\nadvantages, and these were pressed in chapter 4.\n\nThe intuitive idea behind counterpart theory was that individuals, at\nleast ordinary individuals of the kind we regularly talk about, are\nworld-bound. That is, they exist in only one world. But they do not\nhave all of their properties essentially. We can truly say of a\nnon-contender, say Malloy, that he could have been a contender. In the\nlanguage of possible worlds, there is a possible world w such\nthat, according to it, Malloy is a contender. But what in turn does\nthis mean? Does it mean that Malloy himself is in w? Not\nreally, according to counterpart theory. Rather, a counterpart of\nMalloy\u2019s is a contender in w. And Malloy himself has\nthe modal property could have been a contender in virtue of\nhaving a counterpart in w who is a contender. This way of\nthinking about modal properties of individuals has, claims Lewis, a\nnumber of advantages.\n\nFor one thing, it avoids an odd kind of inconsistency. Malloy might\nnot only have been a contender, he might have been 6 inches taller. If\nwe think that is because there is a world in which Malloy himself is 6\ninches taller, then it seems like we\u2019re saying that Malloy can\nhave two heights, his actual height and one 6 inches taller. And that\nlooks inconsistent. The obvious way out of this is to say that he\nbears one height in relation to this world, and another to another\nworld. But that turns height from an intrinsic property into a\nrelation, and that seems like a mistake. Lewis thinks this problem,\nwhat he dubs the \u2018problem of accidental intrinsics\u2019, is a\nreason to deny that Malloy himself is in multiple worlds.\n\nFor another, it allows us a kind of inconstancy in our modal\npredications. Could Malloy have been brought by a stork, or must he\nhave had the parents he actually had? In some moods we think one, in\nother moods we think another. Lewis thinks that counterpart theory can\nreflect our indecision. There is a world with someone brought by a\nstork who has a life much like Malloy\u2019s. Is he one of\nMalloy\u2019s counterparts? Well, he is according to some counterpart\nrelations, and not according to others. When one of the former\nrelations is contextually salient, it\u2019s true to say that Malloy\ncould have been brought by a stork. When more demanding counterpart\nrelations are salient, he isn\u2019t one of Malloy\u2019s\ncounterparts, and indeed all of Malloy\u2019s counterparts share his\nparents. (More precisely, all of his counterparts have parents who are\ncounterparts of Malloy\u2019s actual parents.) In those contexts, it\nis true to say that one\u2019s parentage is essential. Throughout his\ncareer, Lewis uses this inconstancy of the counterpart relation to\nresolve all manner of metaphysical puzzles, from puzzles about\npersonal identity (1971c) to puzzles about truthmakers (2003b). The\nfinal section of Plurality is Lewis\u2019s most extended\nargument that this variability of the counterpart relation is a\nstrength, not a weakness, of the theory.\n",
