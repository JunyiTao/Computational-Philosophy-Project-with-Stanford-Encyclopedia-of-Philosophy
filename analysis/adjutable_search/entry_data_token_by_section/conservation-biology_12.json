    "main_text": "What Are the Aims of Conservation Biology? || \u201cNew Conservationism\u201d\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry, we have consider three philosophical issues in\nconservation biology. First, we began with the ontology of the\ndiscipline\u2014what is biodiversity? We examined three proposals:\nbiodiversity should be multidimensional, it should be operationalized,\nand that the concept should be eliminated from conservation practice.\nSecond, we considered several different important cases studies in the\nscience\u2014modeling northern spotted owls, the equilibrium model of\nisland biogeography and its impact on the SLOSS debate, and systematic\nconservation planning. What is striking is how traditional\nphilosophical questions appear to disappear or be reoriented in recent\nwork. For example, though there are theories and models, the core\ntheoretical structures are different from other sciences since it\ninvolves various conventions and algorithms. Third, we consider the\naxiological foundations of the discipline. Many conclude that the\nsciences involve considerations of value. However, conservation\nbiology was thought to be founded on the intrinsic value of ecological\nsystems though the recent new conservationists have challenged this\nfoundation as resting on soft sand. Critics, of course, have come out\nin full force arguing that this critique misses its mark and the\nfoundations, though apparently shaky, are only apparently so.\n",
