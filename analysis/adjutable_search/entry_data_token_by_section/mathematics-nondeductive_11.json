    "main_text": "Alternative Non-deductive Methods || Probabilistic Proofs\n4. Summary / Conclusions\n\nIt is not clear why one should expect the various non-deductive\nmethods used in mathematics to share any substantive features other\nthan their non-deductiveness. Philosophers looking at the role of\nnon-deductive reasoning in the context of discovery have often talked\nas if there is some unity to be found (for example, the subtitle to\nLakatos\u2019s Proofs and Refutations is \u201cthe Logic of\nMathematical Discovery.\u201d More likely is that the array of\nnon-deductive methods is diverse and heterogeneous. (Compare Stanislaw\nUlam\u2019s remark that \u201cthe study of non-linear physics is\nlike the study of non-elephant biology.\u201d)\n\nWork by contemporary philosophers of mathematics is continuing to push\nthe study of non-deductive mathematical methods in new directions. One\narea of interest is in \u2018mathematical natural kinds\u2019 and\nwhether such a notion can be used to ground the use of analogy in\nmathematical reasoning (Corfield 2004 [Other Internet Resources]).\nAnother area being investigated is the putative role of heuristic\nprinciples in mathematics. (Much of this work traces back to\nP\u00f3lya (1945).)\n\nA background issue in all of these debates concerns the extent to\nwhich each particular non-deductive method plays an essential\nrole in the justificatory practices of mathematics. This question\narises at both a local and global level. At the local level, a\nparticular piece of reasoning to justify a given result may be\nunavoidably non-deductive, yet the result may also be established by\nsome other, purely deductive piece of reasoning. At the global level,\nit may be that our only justification for certain mathematical claims\nis non-deductive. The extent to which our use of non-deductive methods\nis due to limitations in practice rather than limitations in principle\nremains an issue for further investigation.\n",
