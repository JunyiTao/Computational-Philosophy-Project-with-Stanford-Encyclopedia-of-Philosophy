Stoicism teaches that virtue is the only good for oneself,\nthat vice is the only evil, and that everything else is\nindifferent so far as one\u2019s happiness is concerned. That is to say, only virtue can contribute to our\nhappiness; only vice can contribute to our unhappiness. Poverty,\nill-repute, and ill-health are not bad, for their possession does not \nmake us unhappy; wealth, fame and good are not good because their\npossession does not make us happy. If one asks, \u2018how shall I act? On\nwhat can I base my choices between health and sickness, wealth and\npoverty, so that my choices are rational and not arbitrary?\u2019, then the textbook\nStoic answer is that among indifferents some are to be preferred as\nbeing in accordance with nature (Diogenes Laertius vii.101\u20135;\nArius Didymus 7a\u2013b, Epictetus ii.6.9 [for these passages see\nLong and Sedley 1987, section 58]). So whereas it is absolutely\nindifferent how many hairs one has on one\u2019s head or whether the number\nof stars in the sky is even or odd, we do, and in most cases should,\nprefer and select wealth, fame and good health over poverty,\nill-repute and sickness, because these are (in most cases) in\naccordance with nature.  Cicero gives one reason why there must be\nvalue-differences among indifferents: if everything aside from virtue\nand vice were absolutely indifferent, the perfected rationality of the\nStoic wise person would have no function to carry out (On\nEnds iii.50). Wisdom\u2019s exercise would consist in flipping coins\nto select one indifferent over another.\n  \n\nWhen we select things that are according to nature and reject things that are contrary to nature, our actions are\nappropriate (kath\u00eakonta; for Marcus\u2019 use of this term,\nsee i.2, iii.1.2, iii.16.2, vi.22, vi.26.3), and an appropriate action\nis an action for which there is a reasonable (eulogon)\njustification. An appropriate action counts as a morally perfect or\nvirtuous action (katorth\u00f4ma) when it is done from\nunderstanding, i.e., from the wise and stable cognitive state possessed only by\nthe fully virtuous person (Arius Didymus 8).  Although the talk of the\nappropriate action having a reasonable justification might suggest\nthat more than one action could be appropriate for a situation, or\nthat what is appropriate could be relativized to the ordinary person\u2019s\ngrasp of the situation (as some utilitarians consider that action\nright which maximizes expected rather than actual utility), so that\n\u2018reasonable justification\u2019 would be like the law\u2019s\n\u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 or \u2018reasonable person\u2019, the\nStoics\u2019 use of \u2018reasonable\u2019 in other contexts, such as the\ndefinition of the good emotions (eupatheiai) (Diogenes\nLaertius vii.116), the end (Arius Didymus 6a), and the virtues of\nreasoning and rhetoric (SVF iii.264, 268; 291, 294), clearly takes the\nstandard of reasonableness to be the right reason of the fully\nvirtuous person.  This points to there being only one appropriate\naction per situation, a conclusion which is confirmed by Chrysippus\u2019\nclaim that the fully virtuous person performs all appropriate actions\nand leaves no appropriate action unperformed (iii.510). (This\ndiscussion of the \u2018reasonable\u2019 and appropriate action\nfollows Brennan 1996, 326\u201329.) \n  \n\nThe appropriate action, for which there is a reasonable justification,\nis not in all cases the one that obtains or pursues the preferred\nindifferents for the agent.  According to our evidence, while it is\nour nature to preserve our bodily constitution (Diogenes Laertius\nvii.85\u201386), there are situations in which we ought to give up\nour lives (Cicero On Duties iii.89\u2013115, On\nEnds iii.60), for example, to save our country (for discussion of\nthis issue, see Barney 2003 and Brennan 2005).  Further, Chrysippus\nseems to have said that if he knew he was fated to be ill, then he\nwould have an impulse towards illness, but lacking this knowledge he should\nselect the things that are well-adapted (t\u00f4n\neuphuester\u00f4n) to obtaining what is in accordance with\nnature (Epictetus Discourses ii.6.9). This seems to suggest\nthat in the absence of knowledge that one is fated to be ill, one\nshould select health, but either this selection is not guaranteed to\nbe in accordance with nature or to result in an appropriate action, or\na selection (e.g. the selection of health) can be in accordance with\nnature even though what it aims at (e.g. obtaining or enjoying\nhealth), is not.  So perhaps knowing the preferred indifferents guides\nactions only in the way that Ross\u2019s identification of prima\nfacie duties is supposed to help with moral decision-making,\nnamely, by making certain considerations salient to deliberation (for\nthis picture, see Vogt 2008, 173\u2013178), but the account is silent about\nhow to weigh indifferents against each other in a particular\nsituation. Alternatively, it may be that something\u2019s being according\nto nature gives the agent only epistemic reasons for selection rather\nthan practical reasons responsive to some intrinsic value of the\nindifferents (for this view see Klein 2015).  \n\n\nWe might wonder why anything should be called according to nature, or\npreferred, if there are circumstances in which it is not.  Why not\nreserve the label \u2018according to nature\u2019 for what is fated?\nThe heterodox Stoic Aristo of Chios denied that any indifferents were to be\npreferred by nature, pointing out that the same thing could be\npreferred in one circumstance and dispreferred in another (Sextus\nEmpiricus, Against the Professors 11.64\u20137).  However,\nthe orthodox Stoics seem to insist that preferability, and being in\naccordance with nature, is an intrinsic character of some things, and\nDiogenes Laertius reports a distinction between appropriate actions\nthat do not depend on circumstances, such as looking after one\u2019s\nhealth and sense-organs, and appropriate actions that are appropriate\nonly in certain circumstances, such as mutilating oneself (Diogenes\nLaertius vii.108\u20139).  So it is not true of all, but only some,\nappropriate actions that their appropriateness is\ncircumstantial. Perhaps the idea is that while it is only true for the\nmost part that health (or strength or well functioning sense organs)\nis in accordance with nature, this does not mean that the naturalness\nof health (strength, well functioning sense organs) depends on the\ncircumstances.  On this view, what health is for a species is defined by the\nspecies\u2019 nature, and that is unconditionally according to its\nnature.\n\nThe fact that our sources understand what is according to nature both\nin terms of cosmic nature or what is fated and in terms of the\nindividual natures out of which the nature of the cosmos is built up\nraises the question of conflict, for instance when my health, which is\nin accordance with my nature, is not fated, or in accordance with\ncosmic nature.  Such conflict can be avoided for human beings by\nappeal to our rational nature, on the one hand, and providential\ncosmic nature, on the other: our rationality enables us to appreciate\nand will what is according to cosmic nature because the latter is best\nfor the whole.  On the specific question of why we ought to prefer, as\nin accordance with nature, the interest of the community to our own,\nBrennan 2005 appeals to the Stoic doctrine of\noikei\u00f4sis: we have a natural tendency to care for\nothers, at first our family and friends and ultimately our\nfellow-citizens and fellow-humans (154\u201359). We may wonder how\nthis impulse could be strong enough to overcome self-interest;\nhowever, Brennan observes that the Stoic\u2019s realization that\nindifferents do not contribute to happiness weakens one barrier to\nimpartial deliberation: if indifferents were good, the Stoic would\nwant them for herself; since they are not good, she deliberates about\nhow to distribute them as justice demands (164\u201365). Since\nconsiderations of virtue cannot (on pain of circularity) enter into\nher deliberations, what gives \u2018justice\u2019s demands\u2019 content\n(at least in Cicero, and Cicero attributes similar views to\nChrysippus) are considerations of the community\u2019s utility and respect\nfor property-rights (206\u201326). These indifferents are to be\npreferred as more in accordance with nature than, for example, one\u2019s\nindividual utility.\n\n\nAs we shall see, Marcus\u2019 way of addressing the deliberative content\nproblem is in one respect like Cicero\u2019s: the characterization of right\nconduct comes from ideas about what justice demands, and the content\nof justice comes from outside Stoic ethics proper. In Marcus\u2019 case, it\ncomes from the idea that the cosmos is a city and that all rational\nbeings are fellow-citizens of this city. The role of citizen brings\nwith it certain conventional expectations of conduct which Marcus\ntransfers to citizenship of the cosmopolis.\n",
