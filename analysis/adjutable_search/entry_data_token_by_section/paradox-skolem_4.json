    "main_text": "Mathematical Issues || Transitive Submodels\n2.3 Transitive Submodels\n\n\nBefore turning to examine some of the more-purely philosophical\nissues concerning Skolem's Paradox, a few further points about the\nparadox's mathematics are in order. First, in order to get a better\nfeel for how the differences between the model-theoretic and\nthe ordinary English interpretations of \u03a9(x)\nactually give rise to Skolem's Paradox, it's worth tracking these\ndifferences through a slightly more refined version of the paradox. We\nsay that a set X is transitive if every\nmember of X is a set, and every member of a member of\nX is also a member of X (so,\ny \u2208 x \u2208 X\u00a0 \u21d2\ny \u2208 X). We say that a model for the\nlanguage of set theory is transitive if the model's domain is a\ntransitive set and the model's \u201cmembership\u201d relation is\njust the real membership relation restricted to the model's domain (so,\nfor any m1, m2 \u2208\nM, \u00a0 m1 \u2208 \nm2 \u21d4 M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2). Then, as\nnoted in section\n 1,\n the Transitive Submodel\nTheorem says that if we start with any transitive model\nof ZFC, then we can find a transitive model whose domain is countable\n(indeed, we may assume that this countable model is a submodel of the\nmodel with which we started).\n\n\nSuppose, then, that M is a countable transitive\nmodel of ZFC. This has two effects on the analysis of Skolem's Paradox\ngiven in the last section. First, it ensures that the model-theoretic\nand the ordinary English interpretations of \u03a9(x)\nagree on the interpretation of \u201c\u2208\u201d: for\nm1, m2 \u2208\nM, \u00a0 M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2\nif and only if m1 really is a member of\n m2.[21]\n In this case, therefore, the explanation of\nSkolem's Paradox has to involve the interpretation of the quantifiers.\nSecond, the fact that M is transitive ensures that\nM gets more than just membership right. In particular,\nif f and m live in the domain of M,\nthen M\n \u22a8\n\u201cf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192 m is a\nbijection\u201d if and only if f really is a bijection\nbetween the natural numbers and\n m.[22]\n\n\nTogether, these facts help us to isolate what's really going on in\nthe transitive submodel version of Skolem's Paradox. Consider again the\nformula we've been calling \u03a9(x). This formula\nhas the form:\n\u03a9(x) \u2261\n\u00ac\u2203f\u2002\u201cf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9\n\u2192 x is a bijection\u201d\n\nUnder its ordinary English interpretation, this formula says that the\nset-theoretic universe doesn't contain any bijections between the\nnatural numbers and x. In particular,\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n says that there is no bijection between the\nnatural numbers and\n m\u02c6.\n In contrast, the model theoretic interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\u2014the\n one which is relevant to the fact\nthat M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\u2014says\n only that the\ndomain of M doesn't contain any bijections\nbetween the natural numbers and\n m\u02c6.[23]\n Clearly, these two interpretations have the potential to come apart. \n\n\nAnd in the case of Skolem's Paradox, they actually do come apart.\nSince M is countable, the set\n m\u02c6\u2009=\u2009{m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8 m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n must also be countable. So, there really does\nexist a bijection (indeed, 2\u21350\nbijections), f\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192\n m\u02c6.\nOn the ordinary English interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6),\nthe quantifiers \u201csee\u201d these bijections, and so\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n comes out false. What Skolem's Paradox shows\nis that M itself does not contain any such\nbijections. Hence, the quantifiers in the model-theoretic\ninterpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n don't see any bijections\nbetween \u03c9 and\n m\u02c6,\n and so\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\ncomes out true. In this case, then, differences in the ways the\nmodel-theoretic and ordinary English interpretations of\n\u03a9(x) handle the quantifiers provide a perfectly\nnatural explanation of what's going on in Skolem's Paradox.\n\n\nThis transitive submodel version of the paradox has been widely\ndiscussed in the literature (McIntosh 1979; Benacerraf 1985; Wright\n1985; Tennant and McCarty 1987). Indeed, several authors have suggested\nthat transitivity may be necessary to formulate a philosophically\nsignificant version of the paradox (Benacerraf 1985; Wright 1985). See\nTennant and McCarty 1987 for some objections to the latter view.\n",
