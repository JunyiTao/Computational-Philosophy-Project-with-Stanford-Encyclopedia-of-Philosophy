    "main_text": "Ideology and the Rule of Law\n5. Ideology and Justice\n\n\nThe idea that law is ideological is an important contribution to legal\nscholarship. First, it enables a more critical view of the law and its\nrole, and thereby demystifies a set of vital social\ninstitutions. Second, it points to the importance of sociological and\npolitical factors in our understanding of the law. Legality is shaped\nand influenced by non-legal aspects of society, and law, in turn, has\nan impact on society and social change, not just in the obvious\neffects of particular judgments, but in the political culture that a\nlegal system helps produce.\n\n\nThe Marxist view of law as ideology risks, however, an unhelpful\nreductionism.  Conceiving of law as ideological above all else in the\nMarxist sense can promote a crude and erroneous understanding of the\nrelation between power and legality, where law serves only the\ninterests of the powerful and where legal guarantees are mere\nshams. Moreover, this can license a cynicism about the law that is\nparadoxically contrary to the emancipatory aims of the radical\npolitics that was the impetus for the critique of law as ideology in\nthe first place. That is, radical critics risk dismissing altogether\nthe possibility of legal resources for remedying injustice.\n\n\nFurthermore, the cynicism of some ideology views is in fact the fruits\nof a kind of utopianism about law, for it counters the bleak portrait\nof legal ideology manipulated on behalf of the powerful with an ideal\nsociety without ideology or law, where human beings\u2019 relations to each\nother and to reality are transparent and conflict-free. The \u2018end\nof ideology\u2019 thesis, advanced by Bell in a triumphalist spirit on\nbehalf of liberal capitalism, but interestingly even more salient in\nMarxist ideals of communism, might be wrong in its assumption that\nhuman beings can transcend ideology. Indeed, the radical concept of\nideology ultimately casts doubt on the likelihood that individuals\u2019 beliefs can\never provide an objective account of reality, untainted by distorted and\nself-justifying processes of inquiry.\n\n\nHow then, can the concept of ideology be deployed in legal\nscholarship? In fact, the more subtle critiques of ideology grasp the\nextent to which both liberation and manipulation can be embodied in the\nlaw. Recall the nuanced conception of Marx and Engels, where ideology\ngives an inverted image of reality, but a recognizable image\nnonetheless. This suggests that the ideals of legality are not a mere\ncharade but are instantiated in the law, if only in a partial and\nincomplete form. The Marxist historian E.P. Thompson (1975, 265) made this point in\nhis argument for the universal value of the rule of law. Thompson\ncontended that in order for law to function as ideology it must\nproffer some genuine moral value.\n\n\nTo illustrate, consider how someone\u2019s cruelty might be masked by\npolite manners; this does not demonstrate that good manners have no\nworth. Legal ideology, too, might paper over injustice in ways that\nserve justice nonetheless. A functional argument about ideology, then,\nmust concede the value of the phenomenon that serves ideological aims.\nIdeology cannot be devoid of emancipatory aspects altogether; if law\ntrumpets justice, equality and freedom, then it must succeed in\nrealizing these ideals, however imperfectly, in order for law to\nfunction as ideology. We can thus appreciate legal guarantees of a\nprocedural kind for the genuine protection they offer the subjects of\nthe law, whilst at the same time conceding the quietist politics that\nproceduralism might engender.\n The values of legal proceduralism have had considerable influence\non political philosophy, particularly liberalism.  We saw that in his\ncritique of the welfare state, Hayek contended that law\u2019s\nprocedural rules dictated a laissez-faire economy in which the state\nis expected only to provide a framework for private initiatives.\nLeft-wing liberals such as Rawls and Dworkin, in contrast, insist that\nthe state properly plays a role in remedying economic disadvantage.\nRawls was concerned that citizens enjoy the genuine\n\u2018worth\u2019 or \u2018fair value\u2019 of equal political\nliberties (Rawls 2007, 148\u20139). Moreover, he also took the view\nthat both liberal democratic socialism and a property-owning democracy\nwere candidates for realizing his principles of justice. Articulating\nthis as an effort to find an \u2018alternative to capitalism\u2019\n(2001, 135\u20136), Rawls was picking up on the claim in his\npolitical philosophy lectures that Marx\u2019s idea of \u2018freely\nassociated producers\u2019 involves a \u2018democratic economic\nplan\u2019 (2007, 372).\n\n\nNonetheless, Rawls\u2019s political liberalism does not reject\nHayek\u2019s counsel altogether, retaining a preoccupation with\nkeeping the state at bay.  In particular, Rawls contends that\n\u2018the basic institutions and public policies of justice\u2019\nshould be understood as \u2018neutral with respect to comprehensive\ndoctrines and their associated conceptions of the good\u2019 (2001,\n153n27).  Rawls\u2019s \u2018neutrality of aim\u2019 (2001, 153n27)\nreflects what Raz dubbed (1994, 46) an \u2018epistemic withdrawal\nfrom the fray\u2019 which dictates that the scope of the political be\nconstrained by formal procedures: the decision process of the original\nposition; the tenets of public reason; or political liberalism\u2019s\nexplicit exclusion of considerations about the good life.  Indeed,\nRawls\u2019s proceduralist ethic became especially prominent in his\nlater work, where the focus on constitutional questions over the\nremedy of economic disadvantage attracted much critical comment (see\nBarry 1995; Okin 1993; Williams 1993).\n\n\nIt should be noted that Rawls put much store by \u2018the good\u2019\nof a well-ordered political society (2001, 198\u20139) and admitted that\nperfectionist views about valuable ways of living might play a role in\nlegislative decisions about \u2018suitably circumscribed\nquestions\u2019 such as the protection of wildlife habitat (2001,\n152n26).  However, he retained a traditional view of perfectionism as\nin principle inegalitarian, involving the idea that \u2018some people\nhave special claims because their greater gifts enable them to engage\nin the higher activities that realise perfectionist values\u2019\n(2001, 152). \u2018Egalitarian perfectionists\u2019 such as the\nauthor of this entry, in contrast, argue it is human flourishing that\nwe should seek to make more equal in our theories of justice.  On\nthis, doubtless controversial, view, the concern for impartiality in\nthe law should not be allowed to have \u2018imperialistic\ndesigns\u2019 on all political questions (Sypnowich 2017, 85\u20137), so\nthat the community forfeits its responsibility to foster equal human\nwellbeing.\n\n\nNevertheless, concerns about the ideological impact of proceduralism\ndo not call into question the valuable role that the rule of law\nitself should play, even in the most ambitious egalitarian community.\nThe potential for a dismissive approach to law, perhaps, along with\nthe general decline of the influence of Marxism, accounts for why some\nrecent literature has avoided the term \u2018ideology\u2019 and\nopted instead for terms like \u2018discourse\u2019 or\n\u2018narrative\u2019. Such terms also suggest that law should be\nunderstood in a political context, but they are less specific about\nthe nature of that context or its impact.  This seems a loss.\nProperly understood, the concept of ideology offers a nuanced and\nilluminating approach to legality that gives a precise rendering of\nthe relation between law and politics that need not be nihilist or\nreductionist. After all, a proper understanding of the ideological\nrole of law is compatible with other conceptions of how law is to be\ndefined or understood.  This is particularly so if we recognize the\nimprobability of eliminating altogether ideological modes of\nunderstanding. \n\n\nA conception of law as having a moral source, or a\nsource in a system\u2019s institutions, can be independent of a realistic\nappraisal of law\u2019s ideological function, or the ideological process in\nwhich laws are made. Indeed, radical critics of the \u2018war on\nterror\u2019 waged by western governments have pointed to the value\nof liberal legal ideals such as human rights and the rule of law at\nthe same time as they have noted the ideological purposes to which\nsuch ideals are put.  Both positivists and natural lawyers, so long as\nthey do not insist that their conceptions of law are exhaustive of\nlaw\u2019s reality, can permit the influence of ideology, even in its more\nradical interpretations. Law can be ideology as well as other moral or\ninstitutional phenomena at the same time; indeed, law will probably\nnot succeed as ideology unless it is multi-dimensional in just this\nway.\n",
