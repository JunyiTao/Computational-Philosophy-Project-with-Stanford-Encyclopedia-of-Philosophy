Lambert (1728\u20131777)\nin his The New Organon of 1764, and in a letter to Lambert,\nsent to accompany a copy of his Inaugural Dissertation\n(1770), Kant had proposed his own project of a \u201cgeneral\nphenomenology\u201d as a necessary propaedeutic\npresupposed by the science of metaphysics. Such a phenomenology was\nmeant to determine the \u201cvalidity and limitations\u201d of what\nhe called the \u201cprinciples of sensibility\u201d, principles he\nhad (he thought) shown in the accompanying work to be importantly\ndifferent to those of conceptual thought. The term clearly suited Kant\nas he had distinguished the phenomena known through the\nfaculty of sensibility from the noumena known purely\nconceptually. This envisioned phenomenology seems to coincide roughly\nwith what he was to eventually describe as a critique of pure\nreason, although Kant\u2019s thought had gone through\nimportant changes by the time that he came to publish the work of that\nname (1781, second edition 1787). Perhaps because of this he never\nagain used the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d for quite this\npurpose.\nThere is clearly some continuity between Kant\u2019s notion and\nHegel\u2019s project. In a sense Hegel\u2019s phenomenology is a\nstudy of phenomena (although this is not a realm he\nwould contrast with that of noumena) and\nHegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit is likewise to be\nregarded as a type of propaedeutic to philosophy rather\nthan an exercise in or work of philosophy. It is\nmeant to function as an induction or education of the reader to\nthe standpoint of purely conceptual thought from which\nphilosophy can be done. As such, its structure has been compared to\nthat of a Bildungsroman (educational novel), having an\nabstractly conceived protagonist\u2014the bearer of an evolving\nseries of so-called shapes of consciousness or the inhabitant of a\nseries of successive phenomenal worlds\u2014whose progress and\nset-backs the reader follows and learns from. Or at least this is how\nthe work sets out: in the later sections the earlier series of\nshapes of consciousness becomes replaced with what seem\nmore like configurations of human social life, and the work\ncomes to look more like an account of interlinked forms of social\nexistence and thought within which participants in such forms of\nsocial life conceive of themselves and the world. Hegel constructs a\nseries of such shapes that maps onto the history of western European\ncivilization from the Greeks to his own time.\nThe fact that this progression ends in the attainment of what Hegel\nrefers to as Absolute Knowing, the standpoint from which\nreal philosophy gets done, seems to support the traditionalist reading\nin which a triumphalist narrative of the growth of western\ncivilization is combined with the theological interpretation of\nGod\u2019s self-manifestation and self-comprehension. When Kant had\nbroached the idea of a phenomenological propaedeutic to Lambert, he\nhimself had still believed in the project of a purely conceptual\nmetaphysics achievable by the use of the regressive or\nanalytic method, but this project conceived as an\nexercise in theoretical reason was just what Kant in his later\ncritical philosophy had come to disavow. Traditional readers of Hegel\nthus see the Phenomenology\u2019s telos as\nattesting to Hegel\u2019s pre-Kantian (that is, pre-critical)\noutlook, and his embrace of the metaphysical project that Kant\nfamously came to dismiss as illusory.  Supporters of\nthe post-Kantian interpretation of Hegel obviously interpret\nthis work and its telos differently. For example, it has been\nargued (e.g., Pinkard 1994) that what this history tracks is the\ndevelopment of a type of social existence which enables a unique form\nof rationality, in that in such a society all dogmatic bases of\nthought have been gradually replaced by a system in which all claims\nbecome open to rational self-correction, by becoming exposed to\ndemands for conceptually-articulated justifications. As Pinkard had\npointed out in that work, this was a conception of the normatively\nstructured practices of human reason found in the American pragmatist\nWilfrid Sellars, the inspiration behind the Hegelian dimensions of\nanalytic philosophers such as Willem deVries (1988), Robert Brandom\nand John McDowell.\nSomething of Hegel\u2019s phenomenological method may be conveyed\nby the first few chapters, which are perhaps among its more\nconventionally philosophical parts (Westphal 2009). Chapters 1 to 3\neffectively follow a developmental series of distinct shapes of\nconsciousness\u2014jointly epistemological and ontological\nattitudes articulated by criteria which are, regarded from one\ndirection, criteria for certain knowledge, and from the\nother, criteria for the nature of the objects of such\nknowledge. In chapter 1, the attitude of Sense-certainty\ntakes immediately given perceptual simples\u2014the sort of role\nplayed by the so-called sense-data of early\ntwentieth-century analytic epistemology, for example, with which a\nsubject is purportedly acquainted as bare thises\u2014as the\nfundamental objects known. By following this form of\nconsciousness\u2019s attempts to make these implicit\ncriteria explicit, we are meant to appreciate that any such\ncontents, even the apparently most immediate ones, are\nin fact grasped conceptually, and so, in Hegel\u2019s\nterminology, their reception is actually mediated by the\nconcepts with which they are grasped. Hegel is clear that these\ncontents are not merely qualitative simples that are\nimmediately apprehended, but comprehended instances\nof the conceptual determination of singularity\n[Einzelheit] (Phen: \u00a791). Such a simple\nthis, then, can also be understood as an instance of\nwhat the Medievals discussed as thisness\u2014a\ngeneral property of an individual thing\u2019s being\nidentical to itself. One might compare Hegel\u2019s point here to\nthat expressed by Kant in his well known claim from Critique of\nPure Reason (A51/B75), that without general\nconcepts, intuitions (singular [einzeln] purportedly\nimmediate mental representations), are blind. However,\nHegel seems to want to make this point without relying on\nKant\u2019s formal distinction between concepts and\nintuitions as different species of representation. The idea seems to\nbe that for Hegel, the same content can play the roles played\nby both concepts and intuitions in Kant. (The lessons of this chapter\nhave sometimes been likened to those of Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s famous\ncriticism of the empiricist myth of the given.)\nBy the end of this chapter our protagonist consciousness (and by\nimplication, we the audience to this drama) has learnt that the nature\nof consciousness cannot be as originally thought: rather than being\nimmediate and singular, its contents must have some implicit universal\n(conceptual) aspect to them. The general truth that was\nlearned about the apparent qualitative simples in Sense-certainty\n(that they were instances of generals) is now explicitly taken as\nthe truth of the object of Perception\n(Wahrnehmung\u2014in German this term having the\nconnotations of taking (nehmen) to be true\n(wahr)). In contrast to the purported single object of\nSense-certainty the object of Perception is taken as\ninstantiating general properties: it is \u201ca thing with many\nproperties\u201d (Phen: \u00a7112). But this can be conceived in a\nvariety of ways: first, as a simple bundle of indifferent\nqualities (a picture associated with Plato), or as an underlying\nsubstrate in which these qualities somehow inhere (a picture\nassociated with Aristotle). Predictably, problems will be revealed in\nthese various different ways of thinking of the nature of those\neveryday objects of our experience.\nAs in the case of Sense-certainty, here in the case of Perception,\nby following the protagonist consciousness\u2019s efforts to make\nthis implicit criterion explicit, we see how the criterion generates\ncontradictions that eventually undermine it as a criterion\nfor certainty. In fact, such collapse into a type of self-generated\nskepticism is typical of all the shapes we follow in the\nwork, and there seems something inherently skeptical about such\nreflexive cognitive processes. But this is not the type of skepticism\nthat is typical of early modern philosophy, such as that used by\nDescartes in his attempt to find some foundation\nof indubitability on which genuine knowledge can be built\n(Forster 1989). As is clear from his treatment of ancient philosophy\nin the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel was\nattracted to the type of dialectic employed by Socrates in\nhis efforts to get his interlocutors thinking about something beyond\nthat given immediately in sensation (LHP II: 51), and implicit in the\nancient form of skepticism that had been employed after Socrates (LHP\nII: 344). For Hegel, the ancient skeptics captured the skeptical\nmoment of thought that is the means by which thought\nprogresses beyond the particular categories that have given\nrise to contradictions. Just as in the way a new shape of\nthought, Perception, had been generated from the internal\ncontradictions that emerged within Sense-certainty, the\ncollapse of any given attitude will be accompanied by the emergence of\nsome new implicit criterion that will be the basis of a new emergent\nattitude. In the case of Perception, the emergent new shape of\nconsciousness, the Understanding, explored in Chapter 3,\nis a shape identified with the type of scientific cognition that,\nrather than remaining on the level of the perceived object, posits\nunderlying forces involved in the production of the\nperceptual episode.\nThe transition from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4, The Truth of\nSelf-Certainty, also marks a more general transition from\nConsciousness to Self-consciousness. It is in the course of\nChapter 4 that we find what is perhaps the most well-known part of\nthe Phenomenology, the account of the struggle of\nrecognition in which Hegel examines the inter-subjective\nconditions which he sees as necessary for any form of consciousness.\nThis is a topic that had first been taken up by Alexandre\nKoj\u00e8ve (1969), and which has been appealed to in\nnon-Koj\u00e8vean ways recently by a number of non-traditional\ninterpreters in order to give a quite different accounts of\nHegel\u2019s notion of Spirit (Honneth 1995; Ik\u00e4heimo\nand Laitinen 2011; Pippin 2008; Williams\n1992, 1997).\nLike Kant, Hegel thinks that one\u2019s capacity to\nbe conscious of some external object as something distinct\nfrom oneself requires the reflexivity of self-consciousness,\nthat is, it requires one\u2019s awareness of oneself as a\nsubject for whom something distinct, the object, is\npresented as known (a result emerging in Chapter 3). Hegel\ngoes beyond Kant, however, and expanding on an idea found in Fichte,\nmakes this requirement dependent on one\u2019s recognition (or\nacknowledgment\u2014Anerkennung) of other\nself-conscious subjects as self-conscious subjects for\nwhom any object of consciousness will be thought\nas also existing. One\u2019s self-consciousness, in fact,\nwill be dependent on one\u2019s recognition of those others as\nsimilarly recognizing oneself as a self-conscious\nsubject. Such complex patterns of mutual recognition constituting\nobjective spirit thereby provide the social matrix\nwithin which individual self-consciousnesses can exist as such. It is\nin this way that the Phenomenology can change course, the\nearlier tracking of shapes of individual consciousness and\nself-consciousness effectively coming to be replaced by the tracking\nof distinct patterns of mutual recognition between\nsubjects\u2014shapes of spirit\u2014that forms the\nground for the existence of those individual\nconsciousnesses/self-consciousnesses.\nIt is thus that Hegel has effected the transition from a\nphenomenology of the individual\u2019s subjective mind to one\nof objective spirit, thought of as culturally distinct\nobjective patterns of social interaction to be analysed in terms of\nthe patterns of reciprocal recognition they\nembody. (\u201cGeist\u201d can be translated as either\n\u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d, but the latter, allowing a\nmore cultural sense, as in the phrase \u201cspirit of the age\u201d\n(\u201cZeitgeist\u201d), seems a more suitable rendering for the\ntitle.) But this is only worked out in the text\ngradually. We\u2014the reading or so-called phenomenological\nwe\u2014can see how particular shapes of self-consciousness, such as\nthat of the other-worldly religious self-consciousness (Unhappy\nConsciousness) with which Chapter 4 ends, depend on certain\ninstitutionalised forms of mutual recognition, in this case one\ninvolving a priest who mediates between the self-conscious subject and\nthat subject\u2019s God. But we are seeing this \u201cfrom the\noutside\u201d, as it were: we still have to learn how actual\nself-consciousnesses could learn this of themselves. So we have to see\nhow the protagonist self-consciousness could achieve this insight. It\nis to this end that we further trace the learning path of\nself-consciousness through the processes of reason (in\nChapter 5) before objective spirit can become the explicit subject\nmatter of Chapter 6 (Spirit).\nHegel\u2019s discussion of spirit starts from what he calls\nSittlichkeit (translated as \u201cethical\norder\u201d or \u201cethical\nsubstance\u201d\u2014\u201cSittlichkeit\u201d being a\nnominalization from the adjectival (or adverbial) form\n\u201csittlich\u201d, \u201ccustomary\u201d, from the\nstem \u201cSitte\u201d, \u201ccustom\u201d or\n\u201cconvention\u201d.) Thus Hegel might be seen as adopting the\nviewpoint that since social life is ordered by customs we can approach\nthe lives of those living in it in terms of the patterns of those\ncustoms or conventions themselves\u2014the conventional practices, as\nit were, constituting specific, shareable forms of life made\nactual in the lives of particular individuals who had in\nturn internalized such general patterns in the process of\nacculturation. It is not surprising then that his account of spirit\nhere starts with a discussion of religious and civic law. Undoubtedly\nit is Hegel\u2019s tendency to nominalise such abstract concepts in\nhis attempt to capture the concrete nature of such patterns\nof conventional life, together with the tendency to\nthen personify them (as in talking about\nspirit becoming self-conscious) that lends plausibility to\nthe traditionalist understanding of Hegel. But for non-traditionalists\nit is not obvious that Hegel, in employing such phrases, is in any way\ncommitted to any metaphysical supra-individual conscious being or\nbeings. To take an example, in the second section of the chapter on\nspirit, Hegel discusses human culture as the\n\u201cworld of self-alienated spirit\u201d. The idea seems to be\nthat humans in society not only interact, but that they collectively\ncreate relatively enduring cultural products (repeatable stories,\nstageable dramas, and so forth) within which members of that society\ncan recognise patterns of their own communal life as so reflected. We\nmight find intelligible the metaphor that such products \u201chold up a\nmirror to society\u201d within which \u201cthe society can regard\nitself\u201d, without thinking we are thereby committed to some\nsupra-individual unitary mind achieving\nself-consciousness. Furthermore, such cultural products\nthemselves provide conditions allowing individuals to adopt particular\ncognitive attitudes by appropriating their resources. Thus, for\nexample, the capacity to adopt the type of objective viewpoint\ndemanded by Kantian morality (discussed in the final section of\nSpirit)\u2014the capacity to see things, as it were, from a detached\nor universal point of view\u2014might be enabled by\nengaging with spirit\u2019s \u201calienations\u201d such as the\nmyths and rituals of a religion professing a universal scope.\nWe might think that if Kant had written\nHegel\u2019s Phenomenology he would have ended it at Chapter\n6 with the modern moral subject as the telos of the\nstory. For Kant, the practical knowledge of morality, orienting one\nwithin the noumenal world, exceeds the scope of theoretical knowledge,\nwhich had been limited to phenomena. Hegel, however, thought that\nphilosophy had to unify theoretical and practical knowledge, and so\nthe Phenomenology has further to go. Again, this is seen\ndifferently by traditionalists and revisionists. For traditionalists,\nChapters 7, Religion and 8, Absolute\nKnowing, testify to Hegel\u2019s disregard for Kant\u2019s\ncritical limitation of theoretical knowledge to empirical\nexperience. Revisionists, on the other hand, tend to see Hegel as\nfurthering the Kantian critique into the very coherence of a\nconception of an in-itself reality that is beyond the\nlimits of our theoretical (but not practical) cognition.  Rather than\nunderstand absolute knowing as the achievement of some\nultimate God\u2019s-eye view of everything, the\nphilosophical analogue to the connection with God sought in religion,\npost-Kantian revisionists see it as the accession to a mode of\nself-critical thought that has finally abandoned all non-questionable\nmythical givens, and which will only countenance\nreason-giving argument as justification. However we understand this,\nabsolute knowing is the standpoint to which Hegel has hoped to bring\nthe reader in this complex work. This is the standpoint of\nscience, the standpoint from which philosophy proper commences,\nand it commences in Hegel\u2019s next book, the Science of\nLogic.\n3.1.2 Science of Logic\nHegel\u2019s Science of Logic is divided into three\nbooks, dealing with the topics of\nbeing, essence, and the concept, which appeared\nin 1812, 1813, and 1816 respectively. For most of the 20th\ncentury it was not received with the enthusiasm that often marked the\nreception of Phenomenology of Spirit. First, as a work\nof logic most have regarded it as radically outdated and\nrelying on an Aristotelian approach that was definitively surpassed in\nthe later nineteenth century\u2014a view promoted especially by\nBertrand Russell in the early years of the twentieth. Thus many\nreaders sympathetic to particular doctrines in Hegel have attempted,\ncontrary to Hegel\u2019s insistence, to quarantine his philosophical\napproach to particular areas from it. Recently, this skepticism has\nstarted to change.\nSome advocate that the Science of Logic be read as a\nfirst-order ontological doctrine (Doz 1987) or as a category\ntheory that simultaneously represents structures of being and\nthought (Houlgate 2005b), and so as having very little to do with what\nhas traditionally been known as logic. Others argue that\nin contrast to the project of formal (or general) logic,\nit is best understood as a version of what Kant had called\n\u201ctranscendental logic\u201d (di Giovanni 2010). In this sense\nit should thereby be thought of as a successor to Kant\u2019s\n\u201ctranscendental deduction of the categories\u201d in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason in which Kant attempted to\nderive a list of those non-empirical concepts, the\ncategories, which he believed to be presupposed by all\nempirical judgments made by finite, discursive knowers like ourselves.\nIn short, taking the logic as a category theory opens up two\ngeneral lines of interpretation: should the categories be understood\nas primarily ontological categories, as found in Aristotle,\nor as primarily categories revealing the necessary structure\nof thought, as in Kant? Those, such as the advocates of the\nrevised metaphysical interpretation, interpreting Hegel\nas basically a metaphysician, typically stress the former, while\npost-Kantian interpreters typically stress the\nlatter.\nA glance at the table of contents of Science of Logic\nreveals the same triadic structuring among the categories or\nthought determinations discussed that has been noted\namong the shapes of consciousness in\nthe Phenomenology. At the highest level of its branching\nstructure there are the three books devoted to the doctrines of\nbeing, essence, and concept,\nwhile in turn, each book has three sections, each section containing\nthree chapters, and so on. In general, each of these individual nodes\ndeals with some particular category. In fact, Hegel\u2019s categorial\ntriads appear to repeat Kant\u2019s own triadic way of\narticulating the categories in the Table of Categories\n(Critique of Pure Reason A80/B106) in which the third term in\nthe triad in some way integrates the first two. (In Hegel\u2019s\nterminology, he would say that the first two were\nsublated [aufgehoben] in the third\u2014while\nthe first two are negated by the third, they continue to work\nwithin the context defined by it.) Hegel\u2019s later treatment\nof the syllogism found in Book 3, in which he follows\nAristotle\u2019s own three-termed schematism of the syllogistic\nstructure, repeats this triadic structure as does his ultimate\nanalysis of its component concepts as the moments of\nuniversality, particularity, and\nsingularity.\nReading into the first chapter of Book 1, Being, it\nis quickly seen that the transitions of the Logic\nbroadly repeat those of the first chapters of\nthe Phenomenology, now, however, as between the categories\nthemselves rather than between conceptions of the\nrespective objects of conscious experience. Thus,\nbeing is the thought determination with which the work\ncommences because it at first seems to be the most\nimmediate, fundamental determination that characterises\nany possible thought content at all. (In contrast, being in\nthe Phenomenology\u2019s Sense-certainty chapter\nwas described as the known truth of the purported immediate\nsensory given\u2014the category that it was discovered to\ninstantiate.)  Whatever thought is about, that topic must in some\nsense exist. Like those purported simple sensory\ngivens with which the Phenomenology starts, the\ncategory being looks to have no internal structure or\nconstituents, but again in a parallel to the Phenomenology,\nit is the effort of thought to make this category explicit that both\nundermines it and brings about new ones. Being seems to\nbe both immediate and simple, but it will show itself to be,\nin fact, only something in opposition to something else,\nnothing. The point seems to be that while the categories\nbeing and nothing seem both absolutely\ndistinct and opposed, on reflection (and following Leibniz\u2019s\nprinciple of the identity of indiscernibles) they appear identical as\nno criterion can be invoked which differentiates them. The only way\nout of this paradox is to posit a third category within which they can\ncoexist as negated (Aufgehoben) moments. This\ncategory is becoming, which saves thinking from\nparalysis because it accommodates both\nconcepts. Becoming contains being and\nnothing in the sense that when something\nbecomes it passes, as it were, from nothingness to\nbeing. But these contents cannot be understood apart\nfrom their contributions to the overarching category: this is what it\nis to be negated (aufgehoben) within the new category.\nIn general this is how the Logic proceeds: seeking its\nmost basic and universal determination, thought posits a category to\nbe reflected upon, finds then that this collapses due to a\ncontradiction generated, like that generated by the\ncategory being, and so then seeks a further category with which to\nmake retrospective senses of those contradictory categories. However,\nin turn the new category will generate some further contradictory\nnegation and again the demand will arise for a further\nconcept that can reconcile these opposed concepts by\nincorporating them as moments.\nThe method Hegel employs here, determinate negation, is often\ncompared with Spinoza\u2019s principle that \u201call determination\nis negation\u201d, but while Hegel\u2019s is related to\nSpinoza\u2019s thought, it cannot be identified with or reduced to\nit.  Spinoza\u2019s top-down determination starts with a single\ncategory (in his case, divine substance) that is then\nprogressively divided by the application of concepts\u2014the model\nbeing Plato\u2019s method of division in which\na genus concept is divided into particular species\nby the presence or absence of some differentiating property. From\nHegel\u2019s point of view, however, this cannot\ncapture individuals as other than parts of that\ngreater whole\u2014a metaphysical picture in relation to Spinoza he\nrefers to as acosmism. So Hegel will\nbalance this type of determination by negation, with a\ndifferent type of negation modeled on that which holds\nbetween incompatible properties of some object (for example,\nred and blue as incompatible colors) and that is reflected in the\nterm negation of Aristotle\u2019s logic. This allows\nHegel to go beyond the determination of something\nas particular (suggesting the part-whole relation) to a more\nrobust sense of singularity [Einzelheit]\u2014the\nsense of the pure thisness seen initially in\nthe Phenomenology\u2019s Sense-certainty chapter, the truth\nof which was then shown to be Aristotle\u2019s idea of an individual\nthing\u2019s substantial form in the Perception\nchapter. It is in terms of this category that we can think, along with\nAristotle, of a thing having an underlying substrate within which\nproperties inhere and which, unlike the properties\nthemselves, cannot be thought in general terms, but only in\nterms of the category of singularity. And yet this will\nencounter a problem for the determinacy of this underlying\nsubstrate\u2014it will have to find determining contrasts\nthat allow it to be determinately conceived. (In Book 2 of\nthe Logic we will learn that the category of singularity will\nrely on particularity just as particularity has been shown to rely on\nsingularlity. Singular substrates or \u201cessences\u201d can only\nbe known in relation to the general properties that constitute their\nappearances.)\nAttempting to unravel the intricacies of the patterns of dependence\nbetween such categories will be task of this mammoth work, but here a\ngeneral point might be made. If Hegel\u2019s thought here is\nconsidered to be, like Spinoza\u2019s, holistic, it is only\nso at a higher level of abstraction, such that these determinations\nof singularity, particularity\nand universality cannot themselves be understood in isolation\nfrom each other but only via their complex interactions. Hegel\nonly explicitly explores the details of the interactions of\nthese determinations of conceptuality in his discussion of judgments\nand syllogisms in Book 3, The Doctrine of Concept,\nsuggesting that concerns of logic as traditionally\nconceived are not as irrelevant to the Science of Logic as\noften thought. However, the general point separating his approach from\nthat of Spinoza clearly emerges earlier on. Determinate negation is\nnot Spinoza\u2019s principle as Spinoza\u2019s presupposes a whole\nthat precedes its parts, and that all negations are\nnegations of something that is primitively positive. In\ncontrast, Hegel\u2019s negations will be negations of determinations\nthat are already to be conceived as themselves\nnegations.\nThe other basic methodological principle of the Logic will\nbe that this categorical infrastructure of thought is able to be\nunpacked using only the resources available to thought\nitself: the capacity of thought to make its contents determinate (in a\nway somewhat like what Leibniz had thought of as making clear but\nconfused ideas clear and distinct), and its capacity to be consistent\nand avoid contradiction. Again, for some readers, this makes\nHegel\u2019s logic akin to Kant\u2019s transcendental logic that,\nrather than treating the pure form of thought abstracted\nfrom all content, treats thought as already possessing a\ncertain type of self-generated content, (in Kant\u2019s terminology,\n\u201ctranscendental content\u201d) that is presupposed by the\nsubsequent acquisition of all empirical content. But if\nHegel\u2019s is akin to Kant\u2019s transcendental logic, it has\nclear differences to it as well. For Kant, transcendental logic was\nthe logic governing the thought of finite thinkers like ourselves,\nwhose cognition was constrained by the necessity of applying general\ndiscursive concepts to the singular contents given in sensory\nintuitions, and he contrasted this with the thought of a type of\nthinker not so constrained\u2014God\u2014a thinker whose thought\ncould directly grasp the world in a type of intellectual\nintuition. While opinions divide as to how Hegel\u2019s approach to\nlogic relates to that of Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel\nlogic is not simply a science of the form of our thoughts. It is also\na science of actual content as well, and as such has an\nontological dimension.\nThe thought determinations of Book 1 lead eventually into those of\nBook 2, The Doctrine of Essence. Naturally the logical structures and\nprocesses implicit in essence-thinking are more developed than those\nof being-thinking. Crucially, the contrasting pair essence and\nappearance of Essence-logic allow the thought of some underlying\nreality that manifests itself through a different overlying\nappearance, in the way that the forces posited by the\noperations of the Understanding (explored in\nthe Phenomenology\u2019s Chapter 3) are grasped through the\nappearances they explain. In contrast, the categories of Being-logic\nseem to govern thought processes that are restricted to qualitative\nphenomena and their co-ordinations. But distinction\nbetween essence and appearance must itself\ninstantiate the relation of determinate negation, and the metaphysical\ntendency to think of reality as made up of some underlying substrates\nin contrast to the superficial appearances will itself come to grief\nwith the discovery that the notion of an essence is only meaningful\nin virtue of the appearance that it is meant to explain\naway. (In terms of the ultimate conceptual categories of\nsingularity, particularity and universality, this discovery would be\nequivalent to grasping the idea that the singularity of the\nunderlying, non-perceivable substrate or substantial form is\nmeaningful only in relation to something that can bear\nthe particular qualities that constitutes its worldly\nappearance.) For Hegel it is the complex modern, but pre-Kantian,\nversions of substance metaphysics, like those of Spinoza and Leibniz,\nthat bring out in the most developed way the inherently contradictory\nnature of this form of thought.\nBook 3, The Doctrine of Concept, effects a shift from\nthe Objective Logic of Books 1 and 2, to\nSubjective Logic, and metaphysically coincides with a\nshift to the modern subject-based category theory of Kant. Just as\nKantian philosophy is founded on a conception of objectivity secured\nby conceptual coherence, Concept-logic commences with the concept of\nconcept itself, with its moments of singularity,\nparticularity and universality. While in the two books of objective\nlogic, the movement had been between particular concepts,\nbeing, nothing, becoming\netc., in the subjective logic, the conceptual relations are grasped at\na meta-level, such that the concept concept treated in\nChapter 1 of section 1 (Subjectivity) passes over into\nthat of judgment in Chapter 2. It is important to grasp\nthe basic contours of Hegel\u2019s treatment of judgment as it\ninforms his subsequent treatment of inference.\nReprising an etymological point made by H\u00f6lderlin, Hegel notes\nthat a judgment (Urteil) involves a separation\n(Teilung) of parts: in basic terms a predicate is said of\nsome subject giving the judgment the grammatical form \u201cS\nis P\u201d, but in saying\n\u201cS is P\u201d, the judging subject\naffirms the unity existing between the parts. S\nand P are thus meant (1) to be diverse, but (2) to form a\nunity\u2014a situation we are now familiar with in terms of\nthe Aufhebung of parts in a whole. Hegel takes this as\nsignaling two ways of thinking of the relation of subject and\npredicate in the judgment. One can take subject and predicate terms as\nself-subsistent entities that are joined in the judgment, or\none can take the judgment itself as the primary unit\nthat splits into subject and predicate terms.  This in fact\ncoincides with the two different ways in which logical relations have\nbeen conceived in the history of philosophy: the former represents\nthe term-logical approach characteristic of Aristotle, while\nthe latter represents the propositional approach\ncharacteristic of the Stoics and much recent philosophy. From the\nformer point of view one thinks of the subject term as designating a\nsubstance, typically grasped as an instance of a kind, in which\nproperties, designated by predicate terms, inhere. From the\nlatter point of view, one thinks of predicate terms as abstract\nuniversals that subsume or are satisfied by entities to which\nthe subject terms refer, an approach which conceives of the\npropositional content, in Stoic terminology\u2014the\nlecton, the what-is-said\u2014as having a\nprimacy over the parts. Using a distinction from the Medievals, we can\ndescribe the first type of judgments as de re (about things)\nand the second as de dicto (about sayings). These\nalternative joining and splitting approaches can in\nturn be applied to the relationship of judgments\nwithin inferences or syllogisms. While it is more\ncommon for inferences to be thought of as composed of\njudgments which have their own truth values, the judgments\nthemselves can be thought of as gaining their meaning via the role\nthey play in inferences, parallel to the way that the parts\nof the judgment can be thought of as resulting from the\njudgment\u2019s splitting.  Within recent semantic theory,\nRobert Brandom has argued for such an inferentialist\nanalysis and has suggested this way of understanding Hegel\u2019s\nlogic (Brandom 2014), a view that fits with Hegel\u2019s idea that\nthe syllogism is the \u201ctruth of the judgment\u201d (SL:\n593). Thought of in terms of the framework of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental logic, Hegel\u2019s position would be\nakin to allowing inferences\u2014syllogisms\u2014a\nrole in the determination of the transcendental content\nof judgments, a role that is not allowed in Kant.\nAs we have said, Hegel\u2019s logic is meant somehow to generate a\ncontent\u2014to produce a type of ontology\u2014and this\ncomes into explicit focus with Hegel\u2019s puzzling claim in Book 3\nconcerning a syllogism that has become \u201cconcrete\u201d and\n\u201cfull of content\u201d that thereby has necessary\nexistence (SL: 616\u20137). In contrast with Kant, Hegel seems to go\nbeyond a transcendental deduction of the formal conditions of\nexperience and thought and to a deduction of their material\nconditions. Traditionalists will here point to Hegel\u2019s allusions\nto the ontological proof (SL: 625) of medieval theology in which\nthe existence of God is seen as necessitated by his\nconcept\u2014an argument undermined by Kant\u2019s criticism of the\ntreatment of existence as a predicate. In Hegel\u2019s\nversion, it is said, the objective existence that God achieves in the\nworld is seen as necessitated by his essential\nself-consciousness. Non-traditional readings, in contrast, would have\nto interpret this aspect of Hegel\u2019s logic very\ndifferently. Brandom\u2019s inferentialist interpretation of Hegel,\nwhen joined to ideas taken from Hegel\u2019s treatment of\nself-consciousness in the Phenomenology, suggests a way\nforward here.\nThe first thing to be emphasized here is that we shouldn\u2019t\nthink of judgments and their contents as something\nlike mental contents\u2014subjective or psychological states\nof a thinker\u2019s mind.  Such a psychologistic\nattitude was opposed by Hegel just as it was opposed by a figure as\ncentral to modern logic as Gottlob Frege. For Frege, thoughts are not\nmental, rather they are abstract entities like\nnumbers, so the problem facing us is not how to go from mental\ncontents to the concrete world, it is how to go from abstract\nto concrete ones. But here we must keep in mind Hegel\u2019s two-fold\nway of thinking about judgments, de dicto and de re,\nand while it is usual to think of the contents of de dicto\njudgments as abstract (here to think of the content\nas propositional is usual), some have thought of the contents\nof de re judgments as including the thing itself\n(the \u201cre\u201d) that the judgment is about.  (In fact\nBertrand Russell had, at points in his career, entertained such an\nidea of propositional content itself.) Thus when Hegel\ncharacterizes some judgment structures (typically perception based\njudgments) as judgments of existence one might take the\nperceived thing itself as straightforwardly part of the\ncontent of the judgment. It is a concrete object, but\nnot grasped as a concrete simple, but grasped in relation to\nwhat is judged of it in the predicate. And to the extent\nthat judgments can be considered components of syllogisms, we\nmight appreciate how syllogisms might have become\ncontentful in a process that has culminated in the concrete syllogism of\nnecessity.\nIf the concrete object of a de re judgment is effectively\nwhat had been under consideration in Chapter 2, Perception, in\nthe Phenomenology (the thing with properties), we now might\nenvisage where Hegel\u2019s thought is headed in these sections of\nthe subjective logic. In the Phenomenology it turned out that\nthe capacity for a subject to entertain objects of consciousness such\nas perceptual ones was that such a subject was capable\nof self-consciousness. It then turned out that to be capable\nof self-consciousness the subject had to exist in a world with other\nembodied subjects whose intentions it could recognize. It is here that\nwe might pick up Robert Brandom\u2019s suggestion, following Sellars,\nthat we should think of the existence of inferential processes or\nprocesses of reasoning as presupposing participation within social\ncommunicative interactions in which the making of an assertion is\nconsidered as a move in a language-game of the \u201cgiving and\nasking for reasons\u201d. In short, we may think of Hegel\u2019s\nsyllogism of necessity, which constitutes the ground or\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the earlier formal conception of\nsyllogisms, as a type of inter-subjective practice embodying\nthought\u2014a type of syllogising practice that is by\nnecessity inter-subjective and recognitive. Formally considered we\nmight think of this syllogism as the logical schematization of the\nmost developed form of recognition in which thinkers\nacknowledge others as free thinkers.\nI have suggested that in the syllogism of necessity with which\nHegel\u2019s treatment of inference terminates we get a glimpse of a\ntype of contentful and dynamic rational process unfolding in the midst\nof the recognitive and communicative interactions between finite\nliving and intentional beings. What we see here is a reprise of the\nconception of logos as an objective process running through the world\nas had been conceived by the ancient Stoics and neo-Platonists. But it\nis now embedded not simply in the world as\nsuch\u2014in nature\u2014but in\nobjectivized spirit, in human communities of thinkers. We are\nnow returned to the domain of objectivity that had\ncharacterized Books 1 and 2 of the Science of Logic, but we\nmight expect such a return from subjectivity to have effected\na change in objectivity as earlier understood.\nTo cross straight into a consideration of the objectivity of the\nhuman world of action and thought\u2014spirit\u2014would be to break\nthe developmental pattern of the logic because thought about such a\ncomplex form of objective existence will presuppose thought about\nsimpler forms. And so the starting point for the consideration of\nobjectivity will again be that of the simple object as something\nimmediately grasped by thought. But this object can now be\ndeveloped with that elaborate conceptual apparatus that\nhas emerged in the preceding section. Progression here will be from a\nna\u00efve and immediate concept of an object as simple\nself-sufficient thing, a thing with its identity centered on itself,\nthrough the more complex idea of an object as grasped from within the\ninterstices of physical and chemical thought, to the models of\nteleological and living systems. The Logic then transitions\ninto a consideration of the \u201cadequate concept, the\nobjectively true, or the true as such\u201d (SL:\n670). This adequate concept is the Idea, which, after tracking through\nconsiderations of the living individual and theoretical and\npractical cognition, emerges as the Absolute Idea.\n3.2 Hegel\u2019s Encyclopaedic System and its Expansions\nAs we have mentioned, Hegel\u2019s Encyclopaedia of\nPhilosophical Sciences was written as a teaching manual, various\nparts of which were later expanded upon in lecture courses devoted to\nspecific parts of the system. The first part of\nthe Encyclopaedia is essentially a condensed version of his\nearlier Science of Logic, considered above. We will pass over\na consideration of this work to the next component of\nthe Encyclopaedia, Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of\nNature.\n3.2.1. Philosophy of Nature\nHegel\u2019s Philosophy of Nature (first published as\nsuch in 1842, and based on \u00a7\u00a7245\u2013376 from the\n1830 Encyclopaedia, supplemented by material and student\ntranscripts from Hegel\u2019s Berlin lectures) has often been damned\nby the contention that Hegel had simply dismissed the\nactivity of the natural sciences, especially Newtonian science, as\nbased upon the inadequacies of the Understanding, and in\ntheir place had tried to somehow deduce the natural\nworld from philosophical first principles. Recently, however, defenses\nof Hegel\u2019s philosophy of science have started to emerge,\nespecially from the side of Hegel\u2019s reformed\nmetaphysical interpreters. Thus, it has been argued by Westphal\n(2008) for example, that Hegel\u2019s philosophy of nature actually\nrepresents a sophisticated attempt to think through epistemological\nassumptions that are presupposed by the development of Newton\u2019s\ntheory. Defending Hegel\u2019s philosophy of science from a similar\npoint of view, James Kreines (2008) has argued for the relevance of\nHegel\u2019s logical categories for the biological sciences of his\ntimes. We won\u2019t here attempt to present such arguments, but\nbefore any such reassessment of Hegel\u2019s work here could\nbe undertaken, the fundamental criticism raised above of a project\nthat attempts to base a philosophy of nature on his logic rather than\nthe empirical sciences must be addressed. Was not Hegel simply trying\nto pre-empt the work of empirical scientists by somehow attempting to\nanticipate the very contents of their discoveries from\nlogical considerations alone?\nThis objection is often summed up under the slogan of\n\u201cdeducing Krug\u2019s pen\u201d, in that in 1801 the\nphilosopher W.T. Krug had accused Schelling\u2019s idealist\nphilosophy of nature of aiming to deduce the nature of all contingent\nphenomena, even that of the pen with which he, Krug, was writing his\ncritique. Hegel responded to Krug\u2019s accusation in the following\nyear, claiming that Krug had made the common mistake of conflating the\nunderstanding with reason, and treating the Absolute as something on\nthe same level as finite things.\nHegel was, at this time, closely aligned with Schelling\u2019s\nviews, and would separate his own views from\nSchelling\u2019s in subsequent years leading up to the writing\nof Phenomenology of Spirit. Nevertheless, Hegel clearly\nthought that his point held regardless of the relation of his own\nviews to Schelling\u2019s as he was to make similar points against\nKrug in a remark added to the Philosophy of Nature from the\nHeidelberg and Berlin periods. While logic must not be restricted to\nthe \u201cform\u201d of an externally given \u201cmatter\u201d,\nnevertheless,\nit is the height of pointlessness to demand of the\nconcept that it should explain \u2026 construe or deduce these\ncontingent products of nature. (PN: \u00a7250, remark. Krug is\nmentioned explicitly in a footnote at this point.)\n\n\nThe point is expanded upon further when it is\nsaid that it is\nan error on the part of the philosophy of nature\nto attempt to face up to all phenomena; this is done in the finite\nsciences, where everything has to be reduced to general conceptions\n(hypotheses). In these sciences the empirical element is the sole\nconfirmation of the hypothesis, so that everything has to be\nexplained.  (PN: \u00a7270, addition)\nIn keeping with the more general idea that that philosophy attempts\nto discern or recognize concepts in\nrepresentations (Vorstellungen) or empirical appearances, philosophy of\nnature investigates the conceptual structures that are manifest in the\nproducts of the scientific work that is done on the basis of those\nappearances.\nTraces of conceptual determination will certainly\nsurvive in the most particularized product, although they will not\nexhaust its nature. (PN: \u00a7250 remark)\n\n\nClearly, philosophy of nature is not in competition with the empirical\nnatural sciences; it takes as its subject matter the results of those\nsciences in order to discover within them the particular ways in which\nthe necessary categorial structures deduced in the logic are\nexpressed.\nIn terms of topics treated, the Philosophy of Nature\nlargely coincides with those treated in the third book of\nthe Science of Logic when the logical processes and relations\nin question have returned to objectivity after the\nexcursion into the subjectivity of formal logic at the outset\nof Book 3.  In Mechanism Hegel had reconstructed a\nmovement in thought from a primitive cosmology in which all objects\nare conceived in relation to a central object (the sun) that\nexemplifies objecthood per se, to a system of objects within\nwhich any such self-sufficient center has been\neliminated. In this Newtonian world, that which gives order to the\nwhole now has the ideality of law, but this\nis itself thought of as external to the system\nof objects.\nAfter an Introduction, Section One of\nthe Philosophy of Nature, Mechanics, expands on this\nprogression through considerations of space and time, matter\nconsidered as the diversity of individual bodies distributed in space\nand time, and finally the idea of universal gravitation as the\ndeterminate concept of such corporeal matter realized as idea\n(PN: \u00a7270). In the Newtonian laws of mechanics, however, the\nunity of matter is still only formal, and in Section\nTwo, Physics, the determinateness of form is now considered\nas immanent within such corporeal matter.\n\nMatter has individuality to the extent that it is\ndetermined within itself by having being-for-self developed within\nit. It is through this determination that matter breaks away from\ngravity and manifests itself as implicitly self-determining. (PN:\n\u00a7273)\n\n\nWhile Mechanics clearly reflects the\nmore space-filling conception of matter dominant in\nBritish thought, Physics is consistent with the more\ndynamic continental European conception of matter\noriginating in Leibniz with his idea of living\nforces. Within this framework, Hegel attempts to organize a\nvast array of areas of contemporary physical investigation including\nmeteorology, theories of sound and heat, light and electricity up to\nand including chemical processes which stand on the\nthreshold of Organic Physics, dealt with in Section\nThree. The study of organics represents a return to the consideration\nof the individual body with which Mechanics had\nstarted, but now considered as \u201cinfinite process in which\nthe individuality determines itself as the particularity or\nfinitude which it also negates, and returns into itself by\nre-establishing itself at the end of the process as the beginning\u201d. The\nbody is now \u201can impregnated and negative unity, which\nby relating itself to itself, has become essentially self-centred\nand subjective\u201d (PN: \u00a7337). From such a conception,\nthe first body to be considered is that of the earth\nitself, along with its history. Chapter Two moves to a\nconsideration of the plant and Chapter Three, the animal\norganism.\nFrom the point of view of the actual content of scientific theories\nand approaches that Hegel summarizes and locates within his system,\nhis Philosophy of Nature is clearly a product of his time.\nNevertheless, many of the underlying philosophical issues dealt with\nare still now far from settled. Thus, while Newtonian physics clearly\nbecame established in ways that made Leibniz\u2019s dynamic physics\nseem obsolete as empirical theory, debate still goes on as to\nwhether conceptions of space-time in post-Newtonian physics is to be\nconceived in Newtonian or Leibnizian ways.\n3.2.2 Philosophy of Subjective and Objective Spirit\nIn the Encyclopaedia, Philosophy of Nature is\nfollowed by Philosophy of Spirit (Geist).\nHegel\u2019s usual triadic pattern when applied here results in\nsections devoted to the philosophies of subjective spirit, objective\nspirit, and absolute spirit. Philosophy of subjective spirit\nconstitutes what is closest in Hegel\u2019s philosophy to a\nphilosophy of mind in the contemporary sense, while the philosophy\nof objective spirit concerns those objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified in patterns of human life we have seen at work\nin Phenomenology of Spirit. Within subjective spirit, we may\nanticipate that the first division, Anthropology, will\nfollow on from topics with which Philosophy of Nature\nends\u2014the animal organism\u2014and so it does. Thus here Hegel\nis concerned with what he terms \u201cSeele\u201d,\n\u201csoul\u201d\u2014which seems to translate more the ancient\nGreek term, \u201cpsyche\u201d\u2014and hence\nthe mind-body relation:\nIf soul and body are absolutely opposed to one\nanother as is maintained by the abstractive intellectual consciousness,\n\n\nHegel comments,\nthen there is no possibility of any community\nbetween them. The community was, however, recognized by ancient\nmetaphysics as an undeniable fact. (PN: \u00a7 389\nadd)\nThe Seele of Anthropology should therefore not be\nconfused with the modern subjective conception of mind, as exemplified\nby Descartes and other early modern philosophers. Aristotle had\nconceived of the soul as the form of the body, not as a\nsubstance separate from that of the body, and had attributed lesser\nsouls to animals and even plants. (Again, Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nsubstantial form comes into view.) Concomitantly, in\nthis section Hegel describes spirit as sunk in nature,\nand treats consciousness as largely limited to what now might be\ndescribed as sentient or phenomenal consciousness\nalone\u2014the feeling soul. Consciousness in\nthe sense of the modern subject\u2013object opposition only makes its\nappearance in the following second section, Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which, reprising key moments from the earlier book of\nthat name, raises a problem for how we are to understand the relation\nof phenomenology and systematic philosophy: is it\na path to it or part of it? Given that the\nrecognitive approach to self-consciousness presupposes that\npotential self-consciousnesses are in fact embodied and\nlocated in the world, we would expect the mind as treated\nin Psychology to be no less embodied as the way in which it\nis conceived in Anthropology. What in fact distinguishes the\nmind of Psychology from that of Anthropology is its\nrational capacities, considered in terms that would now be described\nas normative rather than simply naturalistic, and this\nfor Hegel clearly signals a difference in the way in which an actual\npsychological subject relates to his or her own body. The\ntype of abstractive thinking found in Psychology\ndoes not, of course, as in mythical images of metempsychosis\u2014a\nfavorite trope of Platonists\u2014involve the mind leaving\nthe body.  This would count for Hegel as a piece of mythical\npicture thinking\u2014a Vorstellung. Rather,\nit involves a certain capacity of the psychological subject to suspend\nunreflected-upon endorsement of the claims made on behalf of\nhis or her body, for example, to subject the evidence\ngiven by the senses to rational scrutiny.\nGiven the dialectical mode in which Hegel\u2019s texts progress,\nas seen already in both Phenomenology of Spirit\nand Science of Logic, we will expect the capacities examined\nin Psychology to ultimately depend upon those that come under\nconsideration in the context of objective spirit. In this\nsense, we are witnessing within another mode, the type of progression\nseen in the movement in Phenomenology from shapes of\nconsciousness to shapes of spirit. The\ninternal Phenomenology of Spirit seems to play an important\nrole in setting up this transition from Psychology\nto Objective Spirit (Williams 2007), but it might also be\nseen as crucial in relating the more cognitive dimensions\nof Psychology back to the theme of embodiment prominent\nin Anthropology (Nuzzo 2013a).Thus any naturalistic analysis is ultimately\nsurpassed by a social and historical one, which itself cannot\nbe understood as anti-naturalistic.\nThe philosophy of subjective spirit passes over into that\nof objective spirit, which concerns the objective patterns of\nsocial interaction and the cultural institutions within which spirit\nis objectified. The book entitled Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight, published in 1821 as a textbook to accompany Hegel\u2019s\nlectures at the University of Berlin, essentially corresponds to a\nmore developed version of the philosophy of objective spirit and will\nbe considered here.\nElements of the Philosophy of Right\nThe Philosophy of Right (as it is more commonly called)\ncan be read as a political philosophy that stands independently of the\nsystem (Tunick 1992), despite the fact that Hegel intended it to be\nread against the background of the developing conceptual\ndeterminations of the Logic. The text proper starts from the\nconception of a singular willing subject (grasped from the point of\nview of its individual self-consciousness) as the bearer of\nabstract right. While this conception of the individual\nwilling subject possessing some kind of fundamental rights was in fact\nthe starting point of many modern political philosophies (such as that\nof Locke, for example) the fact that Hegel commences here does not\ntestify to any ontological assumption that the consciously willing and\nright-bearing individual is the basic atom from which all society can\nbe understood as constructed\u2014an idea at the heart of standard\nsocial contract theories. Rather, this is simply the\nmost immediate starting point of Hegel\u2019s\npresentation and corresponds to analogous starting places of\nthe Phenomenology and the Logic. Just as the\ncategories of the Logic develop in a way meant to demonstrate\nthat what had at the start been conceived as simple is in fact only\nmade determinate in virtue of its being a functional part of some\nlarger structure or process, here too it is meant to be shown that any\nsimple willing and right-bearing subject only gains its determinacy in\nvirtue of a place it finds for itself in a larger social, and\nultimately historical, structure or process. Thus, even a contractual\nexchange (the minimal social interaction for contract theorists) is\nnot to be thought simply as an occurrence consequent upon the\nexistence of two beings with natural animal wants and some natural\ncalculative rationality, as in Hobbes, say; rather, the system of\ninteraction within which individual exchanges take place (the economy)\nwill be treated holistically as a culturally-shaped form of social\nlife within which the actual wants of individuals as well as their\nreasoning powers are given determinate forms. Hegel is well aware of\nthe distinctive modernity of this form of social-life.\nHere too it becomes apparent that Hegel, taking up themes from\nthe Phenomenology, follows Fichte in treating property in\nterms of a recognitive analysis of the nature of such a\nright. A contractual exchange of commodities between two individuals\nitself involves an implicit act of recognition in as much as each, in\ngiving something to the other in exchange for what they want, is\nthereby recognizing that other as a proprietor of that thing,\nor, more properly, of the inalienable value attaching to it\n(PR: \u00a7\u00a772\u201381). By contrast, such proprietorship would\nbe denied rather than recognised in fraud or\ntheft\u2014forms of wrong (Unrecht) in which\nright is negated rather than acknowledged or posited\n(\u00a7\u00a782\u201393). Thus what differentiates property from\nmere possession is that it is grounded in a relation of\nreciprocal recognition between two willing subjects (\u00a771 and\nremark). Moreover, it is in the exchange relation that we can see what\nit means for Hegel for individual subjects to share a common\nwill\u2014an idea which will have important implications with\nrespect to the difference of Hegel\u2019s conception of the state\nfrom that of Rousseau. Such an interactive constitution of the common\nwill means that for Hegel that the identity among wills is\nachieved because of not in spite of co-existing\ndifferences between the particular wills of the subjects involved:\nwhile contracting individuals both will the\nsame exchange, at a more concrete level, they do so with\ndifferent ends in mind. Each wants something different from\nthe exchange. Without this difference, the type of\nabsorption of individual subjects into\ncollective substance of the type of Hegel worries about in\nrelation to Spinoza would occur (\u00a7258 remark).\nHegel passes from the abstractly individualistic frame of\nAbstract Right to the social determinacies of\nSittlichkeit or Ethical Life (PR: \u00a7142) via\nconsiderations first of wrong, the negation of right,\n(\u00a7\u00a782\u201396) and the punishment that such wrong entails\nthe negation of wrong, and hence the \u201cnegation of the\nnegation\u201d of the original right (\u00a7\u00a797\u2013104), and\nthen of morality, conceived more or less as an\ninternalisation of the external legal relations presupposed by\npunishment. Consideration of Hegel\u2019s version of the\nretributivist approach to punishment affords a good example of his use\nof the logic of negation. In punishing the criminal the state makes it\nclear to its members that it is the acknowledgment of right per\nse that is essential to developed social life: the significance\nof acknowledging another\u2019s right in the contractual exchange\ncannot be, as it at first might have appeared to the participants,\nsimply that of an instrumental means by which each gets what he or she\nwants from the other.\nHegel\u2019s treatment of punishment also brings out the\ncontinuity of his way of conceiving of the structure and dynamics of\nthe social world with that of Kant, as Kant too, in\nhis Metaphysics of Morals had employed the idea of the\nstate\u2019s punitive action as a negating of the original\ncriminal act. Kant\u2019s idea, conceived on the model of the\nphysical principle of action and reaction, was structured by the\ncategory of community or reciprocal interaction, and was\nconceived as involving what he called real\nopposition. Such an idea of opposed dynamic forces seems to\nform something of a model for Hegel\u2019s idea of contradiction and\nthe starting point for his conception of reciprocal\nrecognition. Nevertheless, clearly Hegel articulates the structures of\nrecognition in more complex ways than those derivable from\nKant\u2019s category of community.\nFirst of all, in Hegel\u2019s analysis of Sittlichkeit\nthe type of sociality found in the market-based civil\nsociety is to be understood as dependent upon and in\ncontrastive opposition with the more immediate form found in the\ninstitution of the family: a form of sociality mediated by a\nquasi-natural inter-subjective recognition rooted in sentiment and\nfeeling\u2014love (PR: \u00a7\u00a7 158\u201360). (This dependence\nshows how anthropological determinations do not simply\ndisappear with the development of more psychological\nones\u2014they are preserved as well as\nnegated as in the pattern of what\nis aufgehoben. It also shows the mutual dependence of the\ndeterminations of the singularity of the atomistic subjects\nof civil society and their particularity as members (parts)\nof holistically conceived families.) Here Hegel seems to have extended\nFichte\u2019s legally characterized notion of recognition into the\ntypes of human inter-subjectivity earlier broached by H\u00f6lderlin\nand the romantics. In the family the particularity of each individual\ntends to be absorbed into the social unit (one is a part of\none\u2019s family), giving this manifestation\nof Sittlichkeit a one-sidedness that is the inverse of that\nfound in market relations in which participants grasp themselves in\nthe first instance as singular [einzeln]\nself-identical individuals who then enter into relationships\nthat are external to them.\nThese two opposite but interlocking principles of social existence\nprovide the basic structures in terms of which the component parts of\nthe modern state are articulated and understood. As both contribute\nparticular characteristics to the subjects involved in them, part of\nthe problem for the rational state will be to ensure that each of\nthese two principles mediates the other, each thereby mitigating\nthe one-sidedness of the other. Thus, individuals who\nencounter each other in the external relations of the\nmarket place and who have their subjectivity shaped by such relations\nalso belong to families where they are subject to opposed\ninfluences. Moreover, even within the ensemble of production and\nexchange mechanisms of civil society individuals will belong to\nparticular estates (the agricultural estate, that of\ntrade and industry, and the universal estate of civil\nservants (PR: \u00a7\u00a7199\u2013208)), whose internal forms of\nsociality will show family-like features.\nAlthough the actual details of Hegel\u2019s mapping\nof the categorical structures of the Logic onto\nthe Philosophy of Right are far from clear, the general\nmotivation is apparent.  Hegel\u2019s logical categories can be read\nas an attempt to provide a schematic account of the material (rather\nthan formal) conditions required for developed self-consciousness for\nwhom rationality and freedom are maximized. Thus we might regard the\nvarious syllogisms of Hegel\u2019s Subjective\nLogic as attempts to chart the skeletal structures of those\ndifferent types of recognitive inter-subjectivity necessary to sustain\nvarious aspects of rational cognitive and conative functioning\n(self-consciousness). From this perspective, we might\nsee his logical schematisation of the modern\nrational state as a way of displaying just those sorts\nof mediating institutions that a state must provide if it is to answer\nRousseau\u2019s question of the form of association needed for the\nformation and expression of the general will.\nConcretely, for Hegel it is representation of the estates within\nthe legislative bodies that is to achieve this (PR:\n\u00a7\u00a7301\u201314). As the estates of civil society group their\nmembers according to their common interests, and as the deputies\nelected from the estates to the legislative bodies give voice to those\ninterests within the deliberative processes of legislation, the\noutcome of this process might give expression to the general\ninterest. But Hegel\u2019s republicanism is here\nbalanced by his invocation of the familial principle: such\nrepresentative bodies can only provide the content of the\nlegislation to a constitutional monarch who must add to it\nthe form of the royal decree\u2014an individual \u201cI will\n\u2026\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7275\u201381). To declare that for Hegel\nthe monarch plays only a symbolic role here is to miss\nthe fundamentally idealist complexion of his political philosophy. The\nexpression of the general will in legislation cannot be thought of as\nan outcome of some quasi-mechanical process: it must\nbe willed. If legislation is to express the general will,\ncitizens must recognize it as expressing their wills; and\nthis means, recognising it as willed. The monarch\u2019s\nexplicit \u201cI will\u201d is thus needed to close this recognitive\ncircle, lest legislation look like a mechanical compromise resulting\nfrom a clash of contingent interests, and so as\nactively willed by nobody. Thus while Hegel is critical of\nstandard social contract theories, his own conception of\nthe state is still clearly a complicated transformation of those of\nRousseau and Kant.\nPerhaps one of the most influential parts of\nHegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right concerns his analysis of\nthe contradictions of the unfettered capitalist economy. On the one\nhand, Hegel agreed with Adam Smith that the interlinking of productive\nactivities allowed by the modern market meant that \u201csubjective\nselfishness\u201d turned into a \u201ccontribution towards the\nsatisfaction of the needs of everyone else\u201d (PR: \u00a7199). But\nthis did not mean that he accepted Smith\u2019s idea that this\n\u201cgeneral plenty\u201d produced thereby diffused (or\n\u201ctrickled down\u201d) though the rest of society. From within\nthe type of consciousness generated within civil society, in which\nindividuals are grasped as bearers of rights abstracted\nfrom the particular concrete relationships to which they belong,\nSmithean optimism may seem justified. But this simply attests to the\none-sidedness of this type of abstract thought, and the need for it to\nbe mediated by the type of consciousness based in the family in which\nindividuals are grasped in terms of the way they belong to\nthe social body. In fact, the unfettered operation of the\nmarket produces a class caught in a spiral of poverty.\nStarting from this analysis, Marx later used it as evidence of the\nneed to abolish the individual proprietorial rights at the heart of\nHegel\u2019s civil society and socialise the means of\nproduction.  Hegel, however, did not draw this conclusion. His\nconception of the exchange contract as a form of recognition that\nplayed an essential role within the state\u2019s capacity to provide\nthe conditions for the existence of rational and free-willing subjects\nwould certainly prevent such a move. Rather, the economy was to be\ncontained within an over-arching institutional framework of the state,\nand its social effects offset by welfarist intervention. Some of\nHegel\u2019s most telling criticisms of the unmediated effects of\nmodern civil society concern those on the psychological lives of\nindividuals. Recently, an approach to social reality with Hegelian\nprovenance that uses the notion of recognition to articulate such\npathologies has been developed by Axel Honneth (2010),\ntestifying to the continuing relevance of Hegel\u2019s analyses.\nPhilosophy of History\nThe final 20 paragraphs of the Philosophy of Right (and\nthe final 5 paragraphs of objective spirit section of\nthe Encyclopaedia) are devoted to world history\n(die Weltgeschichte), and they also coincide with the point\nof transition from objective to absolute spirit. We have\nalready seen the relevance of historical issues for Hegel in the\ncontext of the Phenomenology of Spirit, such that a series of\ndifferent forms of objective spirit can be grasped in terms of the\ndegree to which they enable the development of a universalizable\nself-consciousness capable of rationality and freedom. Hegel was to\nenlarge on these ideas in a lecture series given five times during his\nBerlin period, and it was via the text assembled on the basis\nof these lectures by his son Karl, that many readers would be\nintroduced to Hegel\u2019s ideas after his death.\nWorld history is made up of the histories of particular\npeoples within which spirit assumes some \u201cparticular principle\non the lines of which it must run through a development of its\nconsciousness and its actuality\u201d (PM: \u00a7548). Just the same\ndialectic that we have first seen operative among shapes of\nconsciousness in the Phenomenology and among categories or\nthought-determinations in the Logic can be observed here. An\nhistorical community acts on the principle that informs its\nsocial life, the experience and memory of this action and the\nconsequences it brings\u2014a memory encoded in the stories that\ncirculate in the community\u2014results in this principle becoming\navailable for the self-consciousness of the community, thus breaking\nthe immediacy of its operation. This loss of immediacy brings\nabout the decline of that community but gives rise to the principle of\na new community:\nin rendering itself objective and making this its\nbeing an object of thought, [spirit] on the one hand destroys the\ndeterminate form of its being, and on the other hand gains a\ncomprehension of the universal element which it involves, and thereby\ngives a new form to its inherent principle \u2026 [which] has risen\ninto another, and in fact a higher principle.  (PWH: 81)\n\n\nThis dialectic linking concrete communities into a\ndevelopmental narrative which shows\nthe path of liberation for the spiritual\nsubstance, the deed by which the absolute final aim of the world is\nrealized in it, and the merely implicit mind achieves consciousness\nand self-consciousness. (PM: \u00a7549)\n\n\nIt is a dialectic, however, which only passes\n through some communities. Hegel\u2019s is a\n clearly Eurocentric account of history.\nIt is thus that \u201cthe analysis of the successive grades [of\nuniversal history] in their abstract form belongs to logic\u201d\n(PWH: 56), but once more, it must be stressed that, as with philosophy\nof nature, philosophy of history is not meant to somehow\nmagically deduce actual empirical historical phenomena, like\nKrug\u2019s pen; rather, it takes the results of actual empirical\nhistory as its material and attempts to find exemplified within this\nmaterial the sorts of categorial progressions of the logic. Thus the\nactivity of the philosophical historian presupposes that of\n\u201coriginal\u201d and \u201creflective\u201d historians (PWH:\n1\u20138). The actual world is full of contingencies from which\nempirical historians will have already abstracted in constructing\ntheir narratives, for example, when writing from\nparticular national perspectives. To grasp\nhistory philosophically, however, will be to grasp it\nfrom the perspective of world-history itself, and this\nprovides the transition to absolute spirit, as world history\nwill understood in terms of the manifestation of what from a religious\nperspective is called \u201cGod\u201d, or from a philosophical\nperspective, \u201creason\u201d. Hegel clearly thinks that there is\na way of cognitively relating to history in a way that goes beyond the\nstandpoint of consciousness and the\nunderstanding\u2014the standpoint of what we now think of as\ninforming scientific history. From the perspective of consciousness\nhistory is something that stands over against me qua\nsomething known, but from the standpoint\nof self-consciousness I grasp this history as the history of\nthat which contributes to me, qua rational and free\nbeing.\n3.2.3 Philosophy of Absolute Spirit\nThe subject matter of the final 25 paragraphs of\nthe Encyclopaedia Philosophy of Spirit, Absolute\nSpirit, came to be expanded massively into the contents of\nthree different lectures series on philosophy of art, religion, and\nhistory of philosophy given multiple times during Hegel\u2019s decade in\nBerlin. Assembled and published in the years immediately following his\ndeath, these were the works through which Hegel was to become known as\nperhaps the most significant synoptic theorist of these cultural\nphenomena. Rather than to attempt to capture the richness of his\nthought here in a few paragraphs, which would be bound to be futile, I\nwill simply try to allude to how this material is meant to draw upon\nthe conceptual resources noted so far.\nArt\nHegel was writing in a time of intense development of ideas about\nthe arts. Kant had treated aesthetic experience largely in relation to\nthe experience of the beauty of nature, but for Hegel aesthetics\nbecomes primarily about art. The reason for this is simple:\nart is an objective medium in which a community collectively reflects\nupon itself, and the art of historical peoples is to be understood\nas the attempt to bring before the consciousnesses of its members the\ntotality of what is. It is as art that \u201cconsciousness\nof the Absolute first takes shape\u201d (PM: \u00a7556). The\npeculiarity of art lie in the sensuousness of the medium in\nwhich its content is objectified.\nIn the 1790s, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel had given\naesthetics an historical dimension, distinguishing the forms of\nancient and modern art in terms of the contrasts\nna\u00efve\u2013sentimental and classical\u2013romantic\nrespectively. Hegel adopts Schlegel\u2019s terminology to distinguish\nas classical the art that thrived in the Greek and Roman\nworlds from the romantic art of post-classical\ntimes. Again, the romantic or modern here will be characterized by the\ndepth of a form of individual subjective consciousness that\nis largely missing in antiquity. But those in Greek antiquity,\nwhere psychological determinations were closer\nto anthropological ones, had lived with a comfortable felt\nunity between spirit and body and between the individual and\nsociety. A characteristic of the Greeks was their\nHeimatlichkeit\u2014their collective feeling\nof being at home in the world as they were each\nat home in their bodies. Modern subjectivity is thereby\npurchased as the expense of a sense of abstraction\nand alienation from the actual world and from the\nself\u2014a consequence of the way the modern subject has become\nrelated to his or her body in a different way.\nHegel, influenced by the work of a former colleague, the Heidelberg\nphilologist Friedrich Creuzer, adds to Schlegel\u2019s categorization\nof art forms by positing a further category of symbolic\nart, characterizing the material cultures of ancient Eastern\ncivilizations such as Persia, India and Egypt. The symbolic art of\npantheistic religions of the East used natural elements to\nsymbolize the gods of their cultures: Zoroastrianism had taken light,\nfor example, to symbolize the divine (Aes I: 325), and animal worship\nwas found in the Egyptians (Aes I: 357). But such\nactual things had to be distinguished from what was meant to\nbe symbolized by them, so violence had to be done to such natural\nforms in attempts to represent the absolute\u2014such cultural\nproducts thus becoming \u201cbizarre, grotesque, and tasteless\u201d\n(Aes I: 77), This, however, undermined their initial function, and the\nGreeks were able to offer a dialectical solution to this\ncontradiction. They gave expression to the Absolute or\nthe Idea by taking as its material the\nspecifically human form, but only on condition of its being\nrendered \u201cexempt from all the deficiency of the purely sensuous\nand from the contingent finitude of the phenomenal world\u201d. But\neven as idealized in Greek sculpture, say, the represented Greek god\nis still an object of \u201cna\u00efve intuition and sensuous\nimagination\u201d (Aes I: 77\u20138), and as such the classical gods\ncontained the germ of their own decline as they could not evade\nthe finitudes incidental to anthropomorphism\n[which] pervert the gods into the reverse of what constitutes the\nessence of the substantial and Divine (Aes I: 502\u20134)\n\n\nA new form of art will be needed to resolve these contradictions, and\nthis is provided by romantic art. But the material for this\nform will not come from within art itself. While Greek art can be\nunderstood as simultaneously belonging to aesthetic and religious\nrealms, romantic art results from a fission within the symbolic realm\nof what in the Phenomenology Hegel had treated as a single\ncategory, Art-Religion. The transition from classical art to romantic\nart represents both a liberation of art from religion and of religion\nfrom art and the sensuous. Thus Christianity, whose rituals centered\naround the myth of God becoming man in the person of Jesus, had\navoided the type of reliance on the beautiful productions of art in\nthe way that characterized Greek religions. The shift from classical\nto romantic art, then, represents a broader shift between a culture\nwhose final authority was an aesthetic one and a culture in which this\nauthority was handed over to religion, and thus represents a shift in\nthe authoritativeness of different cognitive forms. This loss of\nultimate authority is the meaning of Hegel\u2019s often misunderstood\nthesis of the death of art.\nFor further discussion, see the entry on \nHegel\u2019s aesthetics.\nReligion\nIt is well known that after Hegel\u2019s death in 1831, his\nfollowers soon split into left, centre and right\nfactions over the issue of religion. A dispute over an\nappropriately Hegelian philosophical attitude to religion had been\nsparked by the publication in 1835\u20136 of David\nStrauss\u2019s The Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined\u2014the conservative right claiming that\nHegelianism reflected Christian orthodoxy, the left seeing it\nas a humanistic doctrine concerning the historical emancipation of\nmankind. In fact the implications of Hegel\u2019s philosophy for\nreligious belief had been contentious since his rise to prominence in\nthe 1820s. While officially declaring that philosophy and religion had\nthe same content\u2014God\u2014Hegel claimed\nthat the conceptual form of philosophy dealt with this\nconcept in a more developed way than that which was achievable in the\nimagistic representational form of religion. Many opponents were\nsuspicious that the concept of God was emptied of its\nproper meaning in the process of Hegel\u2019s philosophical\ntranslations and Hegel was suspected by some of pantheism or\natheism. Ultimately, then, the source of the corrosive effects of\nHegel\u2019s philosophy on religion indeed could appear to be the\ninsistence that the content of religious belief, like everything else,\nbe grounded on rational, in fact logical,\nconsiderations\u2014the logical coherence of the system of philosophy\nitself\u2014rather than on anything like revelation.\nIn the writings he had produced in the 1790s Hegel had shown a\nclear attraction to the type of folk art-religions of ancient Greece\nin contrast to Christianity, whose other-worldly doctrines did not\nreflect the kind of Heimatlichkeit he valued in\nthe ancient world, and it is common to see Hegel\u2019s later embrace\nof the Christianity he described as \u201cthe consummate religion\u201d as an\nexpression of a cultural and political conservatism of his later\nyears. This under-estimates the complexity of Hegel\u2019s evolving\nviews on both philosophy and religion, however. The limitations of\nGreek at-homeness in the world had to do with the inability\nof Greek life and thought to sustain that dimension of human existence\nthat is reflected in the category of singularity of the\nsubject.  The fate of Socrates had thus represented the ultimate\nincompatibility with the Greek form of life itself of the type of\nindividual, reflective individual who could reflectively\nbring any belief into question and take a stand against\nconvention. Similar incompatibilities could be seen reflected in Greek\ntragedies such as Antigone.\nWith the decline of the Greek world and the rise of the Roman one,\nmovements such as Stoicism and Christianity would come to give\nexpression to an individual point of view, but under the social\nconditions of Rome or the Middle Ages such a subjective point of view\ncould only be an alienated one attracted to what, in contrast to Greek\nconcreteness, would be seen as abstractions. Prior to the modern world\nthere would be no real place in either everyday life or in\nphilosophical culture for any non-alienated versions of the\nreflective or subjective position that had first emerged with\nSocrates\u2014no form of life in which this individual dimension of\nhuman subjectivity could be at home. But\nChristianity marked a type of advance over Stoicism in that its\ndoctrines of the nature of a good life had a this\nworldly exemplar. Thus in describing the doctrine of the\nStoic sage, Hegel seemed fond of quoting Cicero\u2019s dictum\nthat nobody can say who this sage is (LHP II: 250\u20131,\n256). It was the abstractness of the Stoic\u2019s conception of the\ngood man that was answered by the new religious cult centred on the\nlife of the historical Christ.\nIn this sense Christianity marked a definite advance over the more\nintuitively based religious cults to which Hegel had been attracted in\nhis youth, but it would only be in the modern world that the content\nof the core ideas of Christianity could be given proper\nexpression. Thus Hegel treats medieval Catholicism as still caught in\nthe abstractions of a transcendent realm and as caught up in a type of\nliteral reading of this\nreligion\u2019s Vorstellungen\u2014its\npictures. These need to become conceptualized, and this\nhappens under modern Protestantism, and this, for Hegel, requires a\ntype of demythologization of the religious content\nhanded down from the past. Christ must somehow come to stand as an\nexample of the human kind in general, which is the ultimate bearer of\nthe status of being the son of God. Once more, it is the\npurported singularity of the category son of God\nthat must be brought back into relation to the universality\nof the human genus. It is the nature of this result that\ndivided Hegel\u2019s followers into their right and\nleft camps. The understanding of what Hegel means by the\nconcept religion in turn becomes tied to understanding what\nhe means by philosophy. Appropriately the Philosophy of\nReligion thus passes over into the final form of Absolute\nSpirit, Philosophy\u2014a science that is the \u201cunity of\nArt and Religion\u201d (PM: \u00a7572). The mere six paragraphs devoted to this\nscience in the Encyclopaedia and dealing almost exclusively\nwith the relation of philosophy to religion were to be expanded into\nthe massive posthumously published three volumes on the\n(philosophical) history of philosophy based on various sources\nincluding student transcripts for his lecture series given in\nBerlin.\nHistory of Philosophy\nIn Hegel\u2019s time, the idea that philosophy had a\nhistorical development had only recently come into focus. Both Fichte\nand Schelling had discussed the idea of a history of\nreason following Kant\u2019s allusion to such a notion in the\nclosing pages of Critique of Pure Reason, and systematic\napproaches to the history of philosophy had emerged like that of\nW.G. Tennemann, who presupposed a type of Kantian framework. Clearly\nHegel\u2019s history of philosophy would be a present-centered one,\nin which the philosophical narrative would reveal a development up to\nthe point represented by his own philosophy as its\nculmination. It is thus predictably Eurocentric: philosophy\n\u201ccommences in the West\u201d because the West is where\n\u201cthis freedom of self-consciousness first comes forth\u201d\n(LHP I: 99). There is an important caveat to add here,\nhowever. Philosophy is often identified with the capacity\nfor abstract thought, and this is not confined to Europe and\nits history. Rather, it is typical of eastern cultures like\nthose of India and China. As we have seen in the context\nof art, Hegel identifies Greek culture with a type of\nat-homeness in the world\u2014what we might think of as\nthe opposite of a tendency to abstraction and its typical\nattraction to the transcendent or other-worldly.\nGreek philosophy, and so philosophy itself, starts with\nThales and Ionian natural philosophy. When Thales\nchoses water as the \u201cthe principle and substance of all\nthat is\u201d (LHP I: 175) he has abstracted the concept\nwater from the stuff immediately encountered in puddles and so\non. Subsequent attempts to specify what it is that underlies all\nthings show influences of eastern abstraction as in\nPythagoras\u2019s numericism, which is static and \u201cdestitute of\nprocess or dialectic\u201d (LHP I: 212) but later thinkers such as Zeno and\nHeraclitus grasp that which is at the heart of things in more dynamic\nways. This type of dialectical thought which grasps the unity\nof opposites, familiar from the Phenomenology and\nthe Logic, comes to fruition in Plato\u2019s\ndialogue Parmenides (LHP I: 261). What we are witnessing\nhere, of course, is meant to be a progression that in some sense\nmirrors the progression of categories in Hegel\u2019s\nown Logic, but this progression of objective content\ngets joined to another dynamic with the appearance of Socrates. \nSocrates was more than a philosopher: he was a\n\u201cworld-historical person\u201d\u2014a \u201cmain\nturning-point [Hauptwendepunkt] of spirit on itself\u201d\nexhibited itself in his philosophical thought (LHP I: 384). In short,\nSocrates had added a subjective dimension to the otherwise\nnatural moral lives of Athenian citizens, in that he had\nchallenged them to find the principles not of worldly things but\nof their own actions, and challenged them to find these\nwithin the resources of their own individual consciousnesses.\nIn him we see pre-eminently the inwardness of\nconsciousness that in an anthropological way existed in the first\ninstance in him and became later on a usual thing. (LHP I: 391)\n\n\nWith this we see \u201cmoral substance [Sittlichkeit] turn\ninto reflective morality [Moralit\u00e4t]\u201d and\n\u201cthe reflection of consciousness into itself\u201d. \u201cThe\nspirit of the world here begins to turn, a turn that was later carried\nto its completion\u201d (LHP I: 407). This completion would be only\nachieved in modernity because, as we have seen, Socrates\u2019s\nchallenging of convention in terms of resources taken from individual\nconsciousness itself was incompatible with the immediacy of\nGreek Sittlichkeit.\nPlato and, especially Aristotle, represent the pinnacle of ancient\nphilosophy, but this philosophy, no matter how great,\nrepresents its time, that is, the time of the Greek form of\nspirit, raised to the level of thought. Neither Plato nor Aristotle\ncan break free in thought from the contradiction between the\nconception of autonomous subjectivity represented by Socrates and the\nessential collectivity of Greek culture. Classical Greek philosophy\nwill succumb in the same way that the Greek polis succumbs to its own\ninternal contradictions, and what will eventually replace it will be a\ntype of philosophizing constrained within the doctrinal constraints of\nthe new religion, Christianity. But Christianity, as we have seen,\ngives representation to a solution to the problem of subjectivity\nencountered in the form of Socrates.\nPhilosophy proper only thrives under conditions of\nat-homeness in the world and such conditions obtained in\nneither the Roman nor medieval world. Hegel then sees both periods of\nphilosophy as effectively marking time, and it is only in the modern\nworld that once more develops. What modern philosophy will reflect is\nthe universalization of the type of subjectivity we have seen\nrepresented by Socrates in the Greek polis and Jesus in the Christian\nreligious community. Strangely, Hegel nominates two very antithetic\nfigures as marking the onset of modern philosophy, Francis Bacon and\nthe German Christian mystic, Jacob B\u00f6hme (LHP III:\n170\u2013216).  In the 1825\u20136 lectures, from there Hegel traces\nthe path of modern philosophy through three phases: a first\nperiod of metaphysics comprising Descartes, Spinoza and\nMalebranche; a second treating Locke, Leibniz and others; and the\nrecent philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Jacobi and\nSchelling. Of course the perspective from which this narrative has\nbeen written is the absent final stage within this\nsequence\u2014that represented by Hegel himself.  Hegel concludes the\nlectures with the claim that he has\ntried to exhibit their (this series of\nspiritual configurations) necessary procession out of one\nanother, so that each philosophy necessarily presupposes the one\npreceding it. Our standpoint is the cognition of spirit, the knowledge\nof the idea as spirit, as absolute spirit, which as absolute opposes\nitself to another spirit, to the finite spirit. To recognize that\nabsolute spirit can be for it is this finite spirit\u2019s\nprinciple and vocation. (LHP 1825\u20136, III: 212)",
