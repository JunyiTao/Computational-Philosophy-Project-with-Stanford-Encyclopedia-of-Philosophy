    "main_text": "Sources of Knowledge and Justification || Perception\n5.1 Perception\n\nOur perceptual faculties include at least our five senses: sight,\ntouch, hearing, smelling, and tasting. We must distinguish between an\nexperience that can be classified as perceiving that p\n(for example, seeing that there is coffee in the cup and tasting that\nit is sweet), which entails that p is true, and a perceptual\nexperience in which it seems to us as though p, but where\np might be false. Let us refer to this latter kind of\nexperience as perceptual seemings. The reason for making this\ndistinction lies in the fact that perceptual experience is fallible.\nThe world is not always as it appears to us in our perceptual\nexperiences. We need, therefore, a way of referring to perceptual\nexperiences in which p seems to be the case that allows for the\npossibility of p being false. That\u2019s the role assigned to\nperceptual seemings. So some perceptual seemings that p are\ncases of perceiving that p, others are not. When it looks to\nyou as though there is a cup of coffee on the table and in fact there\nis, the two states coincide. If, however, you hallucinate that there\nis a cup on the table, you have a perceptual seeming that p\nwithout perceiving that p.\n\nOne family of epistemological issues about perception arises when we\nconcern ourselves with the psychological nature of the perceptual\nprocesses through which we acquire knowledge of external objects.\nAccording to direct realism, we can acquire such knowledge\nbecause we can directly perceive such objects. For example, when you\nsee a tomato on the table, what you perceive is the tomato\nitself. According to indirect realism, we acquire knowledge\nof external objects by virtue of perceiving something else, namely\nappearances or sense-data. An indirect realist would say that, when\nyou see and thus know that there is a tomato on the table, what you\nreally see is not the tomato itself but a tomato-like sense-datum or\nsome such entity.\n\nDirect and indirect realists hold different views about the structure\nof perceptual knowledge. Indirect realists would say that we acquire\nperceptual knowledge of external objects by virtue of perceiving sense\ndata that represent external objects. Sense data enjoy a special\nstatus: we know directly what they are like. So indirect realists\nthink that, when perceptual knowledge is foundational, it is knowledge\nof sense data and other mental states. Knowledge of external objects\nis indirect: derived from our knowledge of sense data. The basic idea\nis that we have indirect knowledge of the external world because we\ncan have foundational knowledge of our own mind. Direct realists, in\ncontrast, say that perceptual experiences can give you direct,\nfoundational knowledge of external\n objects.[54]\n\nWe take our perceptual faculties to be reliable. But how can we know\nthat they are reliable? For externalists, this might not be much of a\nchallenge. If the use of reliable faculties is sufficient for\nknowledge, and if by using reliable faculties we acquire the belief\nthat our faculties are reliable, then we come to know that our\nfaculties are reliable. But even externalists might wonder how they\ncan, via argument, show that our perceptual faculties are\nreliable. The problem is this. It would seem the only way of acquiring\nknowledge about the reliability of our perceptual faculties is through\nmemory, through remembering whether they served us well in the past.\nBut should I trust my memory, and should I think that the episodes of\nperceptual success that I seem to recall were in fact episodes of\nperceptual success? If I am entitled to answer these questions with\n\u201cyes\u201d, then I need to have, to begin with, reason to view\nmy memory and my perceptual experiences as reliable. It would seem,\ntherefore, that there is no non-circular way of arguing for the\nreliability of one\u2019s perceptual\n faculties.[55]\n",
