    "main_text": "Accounts of the Infelicity of Category Mistakes || The Syntactic Approach\n3.1 The Syntactic Approach\n\n\nOne way to account for the infelicity of category mistakes is to\nmaintain that they are syntactically ill-formed. The most substantial\ndefense of this approach appeared in Chomsky\u2019s 1965 monograph\nAspects of the Theory of\n Syntax.[10]\n Chomsky\u2019s account proceeds roughly as\nfollows. In addition to assignments of general grammatical categories\nsuch as \u2018noun\u2019 and \u2018verb\u2019, lexical items also\nreceive what Chomsky calls \u2018selectional features\u2019. For\nexample, even though \u2018boy\u2019 and \u2018sincerity\u2019 are\nboth nouns, the former receives the selectional features\n\u2018+animate\u2019, and \u2018-abstract\u2019, while the latter\nreceives the features \u2018-animate\u2019, and\n\u2018+abstract\u2019. Verbs and adjectives are also marked with\nselectional features, representing, for each argument place, the kinds\nof argument they accept. For example, the verb \u2018admire\u2019\nexpects a \u2018+animate\u2019 for its subject argument, thus\npredicting that \u2018The boy admires sincerity\u2019 is grammatical,\nwhile the category mistake \u2018Sincerity admires the boy\u2019 is\nnot.\n \n\n\nChomsky\u2019s key argument in favor of the syntactic approach is\nthat the use of selectional features as part of syntax is independently\nmotivated (Chomsky 1965, \u00a74.1). Thus consider the following\nstrings:\n\n(1)\nThe boy who is next to the table is unusual.\n(2)\n* The book who is next to the table is unusual.\n(3)\nThe book which is next to the table is unusual.\n(4)\n* The boy which is next to the table is unusual.\n\n\n\nAccording to Chomsky, while (1) and (3) are grammatical, (2) and\n(4) are not. But in order to account for this difference, it looks like\nwe need to incorporate something like the selectional features\n\u2018+/-animate\u2019 into syntax. And, the argument goes, once such\nfeatures have already been incorporated into syntax, a natural account\nof the infelicity of category mistakes follows.\n\n\nHowever, even if Chomsky\u2019s who/which argument succeeds in\nshowing that syntax should be sensitive to the animate/inanimate\ndistinction, it is not clear that this is sufficient to account for\n category mistakes in\n general.[11]\n For example, Hebrew has a special verb to\ndenote picking grapes (rather than other sorts of fruit), and a special\nverb to denote putting on socks (rather than other kinds of clothing).\nThe following are both category mistakes in Hebrew:\n\n(5)\n* Ani botzer et ha-tamrim.\n\nI am grape-picking the dates.\n(6)\n* Ani gorev et ha-kfafot.\n\nI am sock-putting-on the gloves.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that in order to extend Chomsky\u2019s syntactic\napproach to account for such category mistakes, one would need very\nspecific selectional features such as \u2018+/-grape\u2019 and\n\u2018+/-sock\u2019. Of course, this is not a decisive argument\nagainst the syntactic approach\u2014perhaps syntax really should be\nenriched with such a wide array of sectional features. However, it\ndoes undermine the claim that the syntactic approach can be executed\nusing independently motivated syntactic machinery, as clearly no\n(other) syntactic phenomenon requires sensitivity to whether an\nargument denotes a grape.\n\n\nThere are also some more direct objections to the syntactic\napproach. One issue concerns the fact that one can felicitously embed\ncategory mistakes in other environments. Thus consider the following\nexamples:\n\n(7)\n* John said that rides boy the on.\n(8)\nJohn said that the number two is green.\n(9)\n* John dreamt that rides boy the on.\n(10)\nJohn dreamt that the number two is green.\n\n\n\nWhile embedding the ungrammatical string \u2018rides boy the\non\u2019 in the context of propositional attitude reports results in\nungrammatical sentences ((7) and (9)), embedding the category mistake\n\u2018the number two is green\u2019 in the same environment arguably\n results in felicitous, grammatical sentences ((8) and\n (10)).[12]\n\n\nAnother potential problem for the syntactic approach has to do with\nthe context sensitivity of category mistakes. Consider the following\nexamples:\n\n(11)\nThe thing I am thinking about is green.\n(12)\nThat is green.\n(13)\nThe number two has the property I\u2019ve just\n    mentioned.\n\n\n\nWhether or not these sentences exhibit the kind of infelicity\nassociated with category mistakes depends on context: (11) and (12)\nare perfectly felicitous in a context where it is clear that the thing\nI am thinking about/referring to is a pen, but not so in a context\nwhere it is the number two. Similarly, (13) is felicitous in a context\nwhere it is clear that the property I\u2019ve just mentioned the\nproperty of being prime, but not so if it was the property of being\ngreen. This is a problem for the syntactic approach, because whether a\nsentence is syntactically well-formed or not is a context-invariant\nproperty: it cannot vary according to context in this manner.\n",
