    "main_text": "\n\nIncompatibilists hold that free will and determinism are mutually\nexclusive and, consequently, that we act freely (i.e., with free will)\nonly if determinism is false. However, they disagree amongst\nthemselves about what else, besides indeterminism, is required for\nfree will. One question that divides them concerns which type of\nindeterminism\u2014uncaused events, nondeterministically caused\nevents, or agent caused events\u2014is required. Another concerns\nwhere in the processes leading to action indeterminism must be located\nin order for an action to be free. Different answers to these\nquestions yield different incompatibilist theories of free will.\n\nThis entry examines the main types of incompatibilist theories of free\nwill and considers some of the principal objections to them. It is\ndivided into four sections. The first section focuses on noncausal\ntheories, the second on event-causal theories, and the third on\nagent-causal theories. The fourth and final section considers whether\nwe have any reason to suppose that the requirements for free will\nspecified by these theories are ever satisfied.\n",
