    "main_text": "Character, Wellbeing, Emotion, and Moral Standing || Moral Standing\n3.4 Moral Standing\n\nA creature has moral standing if its interests are morally relevant to\nthe agents whose actions impact it. Stones don\u2019t have moral\nstanding, people do. Moral philosophers disagree about the grounds of\nmoral standing, i.e., that in virtue of which a creature has moral\nstanding. Some argue that the capacity to feel gives a creature moral\nstanding (e.g., Bentham 1781/2011), others favor autonomy (e.g., Kant\n2001). What about lay people (for review, see Goodwin 2015)? According\nto Gray, Gray, and Wegner (2007), lay people side with Bentham:\nWhether a creature can suffer determines whether it has morally\nrelevant interests (see also Robbins & Jack 2006 and Knobe &\nPrinz 2008). \n\nHowever, the influence of another historical tradition, which like\nKant highlights the connection between rationality and autonomy and\nmoral standing, suggests that the capacity to feel might not be the\nwhole story. Sytsma and Machery (2012) provided evidence for the\ntwo-source hypothesis: both rationality and the capacity to feel\nunderwrite the ascription of moral standing by lay people. Others have\nsince identified further factors that influence the ascription of\nmoral standing (e.g., Piazza, Landy & Goodwin 2014), and they have\nexamined how information about the grounds of moral standing can be\nused by people in a self-serving manner (Piazza & Loughnan 2016).\nRecent work connects moral standing ascription to, on the one hand,\nvegetarianism and the treatment of animals (e.g., Piazza &\nLoughnan 2016) and, on the other, the psychological processes\nunderlying dehumanization (Machery 2021).\n",
