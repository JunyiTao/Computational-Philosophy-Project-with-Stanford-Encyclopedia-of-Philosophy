    "main_text": "The Universe of Being\n5. The Universe of Being\n\n\nDietrich did not devote any one specific work to an analysis of\nhierarchy. However, he makes extensive use of the notion in three\ntreatises in particular: the De animatione caeli, the De\nvisione beatifica, and the De intellectu et\nintelligibili. It is clear from reading these works as well as\nDietrich\u2019s other scientific and philosophical writings in which he\nestablished the nature of the metaphysical elements of esse,\nens, entia, and quiditas that he concerned\nhimself with what might be called the metaphysical structure of\nreality.\n\n\nA consideration that is an ever occurring theme in Dietrich is the\nunity of being, both created and uncreated, a unity he expressed in\nthe term universitas entium, or universe of being. Dietrich\ndoes not tell us why he chooses the term universitas over the\nmore common term universum. Universitas of course\ncan mean \u201cuniversality\u201d so that universitas\nentium would mean the universality of being. But from the\ncontexts in which Dietrich uses the terms such a meaning does not seem\nto be implied. Of course the term was used in the Middle Ages, just as\nit is today, to refer to an institution of higher learning, a\nuniversity. Such an institution traditionally has the goal of turning\n(from the Latin versus) all the disciplines toward one thing\nor one state (unum meaning one), which is wisdom. But to\nrender universitas entium as university of beings with its\nheuristic connotation would have an odd or confusing connotation. But\nthe term universitas can also mean a whole community or a\ncommonality of things. This is very close to the modern term universe\nand it seems to fit the context of Dietrich\u2019s own usage. Consequently,\nwe have rendered Dietrich\u2019s term as universe of beings.\n\n\nBut why did Dietrich insist on this particular term? It is interesting\nto notice that the term is not found in the works of St.  Thomas\nAquinas. Perhaps Dietrich wanted to emphasize that the universe as he\nunderstood it included all beings, even the divine being. For Aquinas,\nuniversum was synonymous with creatura, there being\na radical difference between creative being and created being, a\ndistinction that Aquinas highlights by equating the totality of\ncreated being with the universe. Dietrich, however, does not do\nthis. He wishes to emphasize the unity of being, created and\nuncreated.  There is thus a community, or if you will, a university of\nbeing. And so he most likely used this term universitas to\nexpress this community of being.\n",
