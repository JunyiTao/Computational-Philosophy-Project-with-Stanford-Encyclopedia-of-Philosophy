    "main_text": "Composition as Identity\n8. Composition as Identity\n\nA thesis that has a long pedigree but has only recently been gathering\nattention in the contemporary literature is the \u201cComposition as\nIdentity\u201d thesis. The thesis comes in a weak and a strong form.\nIn its weak form the thesis is that the mereological composition\nrelation is analogous in a number of important ways to the identity\nrelation and so deserves to be called a kind of identity. In\nits strong form the thesis is that the composition relation is\nstrictly identical with the identity relation, viz. that the parts of\na whole are literally (collectively) identical with the whole itself.\nThe strong thesis was considered by Plato in Parmenides and\nversions of the thesis have been discussed by many historical figures\nsince (Harte 2002, Normore and Brown 2014). The progenitor of the\nmodern version of the thesis is Baxter (1988a, 1988b, 2001) but it is\nmost often discussed under the formulation of it given by Lewis\n(1991), who first considers the strong thesis before rejecting it in\nfavour of the weak thesis.\n\nBoth the strong and the weak versions of the thesis are motivated by\nthe fact that there is an especially intimate relation between a whole\nand its parts (a whole is \u201cnothing over and above\u201d its\nparts), buttressed by claims that identity and composition are alike\nin various ways. Lewis (1991: 85) makes five likeness claims:\n\nOntological Innocence. If one believes that some object\nx exists, one does not gain a commitment to a further object\nby believing that something identical with x exists.\nLikewise, if one believes that some objects x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexist, one does not gain a commitment to a further object by claiming\nthat something composed of x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexists.\nAutomatic Existence. If some object x exists,\nthen it automatically follows that something identical with x\nexists. Likewise, if some objects x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexist, then it automatically follows that something composed of\nx1, x2, \u2026,\nxn exists.\nUnique Composition. If something y is identical\nwith x, then anything identical with x is identical\nwith y, and anything identical with y is identical\nwith x. Likewise, if some things y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn\ncompose x, then any things that compose x are\nidentical with y1, y2,\n\u2026, yn, and anything identical with\nx is composed of y1,\ny2, \u2026,\nyn.\nExhaustive Description. If y is identical with\nx, then an exhaustive description of y is an\nexhaustive description of x, and vice versa. Likewise, if\ny1, y2, \u2026,\nyn compose x, then an exhaustive\ndescription of y1, y2,\n\u2026, yn is an exhaustive description\nof x, and vice versa.\nSame Location. If y is identical with\nx, then necessarily, x and y fill the same\nregion of spacetime. Likewise, if y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn\ncompose x, then necessarily, y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn and\nx fill the same region of spacetime.\n\n\nClearly not all will agree with each of Lewis\u2019s likeness claims.\nAnyone who denies unrestricted mereological composition, for example,\nwill deny 2. And the defender of strong pluralism in the material\nconstitution debate (i.e. one who defends the view that there can be\nall-time coincident entities) will deny 3. And some endurantists who\nthink that ordinary material objects can have distinct parts at\ndistinct times will deny 5. But there is a more general problem with\n1, as van Inwagen has made clear (1994: 213). Consider a world w1 that\ncontains just two simples s1 and s2. Now consider the difference\nbetween someone p1 who believes that s1 and s2 compose something and\nsomeone p2 who does not. Ask: how many objects do p1 and p2 believe\nthere to be in w1? The answer, it seems, is that p1 believes that\nthere are three things and p2 only two. So how can a commitment to the\nexistence of fusions be ontologically innocent? One recent suggestion\nis that although a commitment to the existence of fusions is not\nontologically innocent, it almost is: to commit oneself to\nfusions is to commit oneself to further entities, but because they are\nnot fundamental entities they are not ones that matter for the purpose\nof theory choice (Cameron 2014, Schaffer 2008, Williams 2010, and see\nalso Hawley 2014).\n\nIf one believes Lewis\u2019s likeness claims one will be tempted by\nat least the weak Composition as Identity thesis. If composition is a\ntype of identity this gives some kind of explanation of why the\nparallels between the two hold. But the strong thesis, that the\ncomposition relation is the identity relation, gives a fuller\nexplanation. So why not hold the strong thesis? Because, many think,\nthere are additional challenges that face anyone who wishes to defend\nthe strong thesis.\n\nThe classical identity relation is one that can only have single\nobjects as relata (as in: \u201cBillie Holiday = Eleanora\nFagan\u201d). If we adopt a language that allows the formation of\nplural terms we can unproblematically define a plural identity\nrelation that holds between pluralities of objects too. Plural\nidentity statements such as \u201cthe hunters are identical with the\ngatherers\u201d are understood to mean that for all x,\nx is one of the hunters iff x is one of the\ngatherers. But, according to the strong Composition as Identity\nthesis, there can also be true hybrid identity statements that relate\npluralities and single objects. That is, sentences such as \u201cthe\nbricks = the wall\u201d are taken by the defender of strong\nComposition as Identity to be well-formed sentences that express\nstrict identities.\n\nThe first challenge facing the defender of the strong thesis is the\nleast troublesome. It is the syntactic problem that hybrid identity\nstatements are ungrammatical in English (Van Inwagen, 1994: 211).\nWhilst \u201cBillie Holiday is identical with Eleanora\nFagan\u201d and \u201cthe hunters are identical with the\ngatherers\u201d are well-formed, it seems that \u201cthe bricks are\nidentical with the wall\u201d is not. However, there is in fact some\ndoubt about whether hybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in\nEnglish, and some have pointed out that this is anyway a mere\ngrammatical artefact of English that is not present in other languages\n(e.g. Norwegian and Hungarian). So it seems that the most this\nchallenge calls for is a mild form of grammatical revisionism. And we\nhave, at any rate, formal languages that allow hybrid constructions to\nbe made in which to express the claims made by the defender of the\nstrong Composition as Identity thesis. (Sider 2007, Cotnoir 2013) (NB\nThe claims regarding Norwegian and Hungarian are to be found in these\ntwo papers.)\n\nThe second challenge is more troublesome. It is the semantic problem\nof providing coherent truth-conditions for hybrid identity statements.\nThe standard way to provide the truth-conditions for the classical\nidentity relation is to say that an identity statement of the form\n\u201ca=b\u201d is true iff\n\u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d have the same\nreferents. But this account clearly does not work for hybrid identity\nstatements, for there is no (single) referent for a plural term.\nMoreover, the standard way of giving the truth-conditions for plural\nidentity statements (mentioned above) does not work for hybrid\nidentity statements either. To say that \u201cx is one of\nthe ys\u201d is to say that x is (classically)\nidentical with one of the things in the plurality, i.e., that\nx is identical with y1, or identical with\ny2\u2026 or identical with\nyn. But then \u201cthe bricks = the\nwall\u201d is true only if the wall is (classically) identical with\none of the bricks, i.e. with b1, or with\nb2\u2026 or with\nbn, which it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe third challenge is the most troublesome of all. In section 2 it\nwas noted that Leibniz\u2019s Law (and its contrapositive) appear to\nbe crucial to our understanding of identity and distinctness. But it\nseems that the defender of strong Composition as Identity must deny\nthis. After all, the bricks are many, but the wall is one. The onus is\nthus on the defender of strong Composition as Identity to explain why\nwe should think the \u201care\u201d in hybrid identity statements\nreally expresses the relation of identity.\n\nThe second and the third challenges have been thought by many to be\ninsurmountable (Lewis, for example, rejects strong Composition as\nIdentity on the basis of them). But, in recent semantic work in this\narea, accounts have emerged that promise to answer both challenges.\n(Wallace 2011a, 2011b, Cotnoir 2013). Whether they do so, however,\nremains to be seen.\n",
