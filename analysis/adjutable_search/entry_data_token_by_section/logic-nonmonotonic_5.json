    "main_text": "Non-monotonic formalisms\n3. Non-monotonic formalisms\n\nPioneering work in the field of NMLs began with the realization that\nin order to give a mathematically precise characterization of\ndefeasible reasoning CL is inadequate. Such a realization was\naccompanied by the effort to reproduce the success of CL in the\nrepresentation of mathematical, or formal, reasoning. Among the\npioneers of the field in the late 1970s were J. McCarthy, D.\nMcDermott & J. Doyle, and R. Reiter (see\n Ginsberg (1987)\n for a collection of early papers in the field and\n Gabbay et al. (1994)\n for a collection of excellent survey papers). In 1980, the\nArtificial Intelligence Journal published an issue (vol. 13,\n1980) dedicated to these new formalisms, an event that has come to be\nregarded as the \u201ccoming of age\u201d of NML. \n\nIn this section an overview will be provided on some important\nformalisms. Since the evolutionary tree of NMLs has grown\nextraordinarily rich, we will restrict the focus on presenting the\nbasic ideas behind some of the most influential and well-known\napproaches. \n",
