    "main_text": "The Simplicity of Forms\n4. The Simplicity of Forms\n\n\nThroughout the dialogues, Forms are said to be one, hen, or\nmonoeides. (See especially the Affinity Argument in the\nPhaedo, 78b-84b.) These passages suggest that the\nself-predicational nature of Forms implies that the only property\npredicable of a Form is itself: i.e., Justice is just and the only\nthing Justice is is just. (There are epistemological reasons that\nsupport this reading: See \u00a711 infra.) But other passages\nsuggest that Forms cannot be simple in this strict sense. From the\nRepublic we know that all Forms are related to the Good. While\nit is difficult to be certain, Plato seems committed to the claim that\neach Form is good, that is, that each Form is a good thing or is\ncharacterized by\n goodness.[8]\n\n\nMore doubts about the strict simplicity of Forms emerge from\nreflection on the nature of definition in Plato's middle period.\nOntologically, all definitions predicate the essence of the Form whose\nessence it is. Plato is attempting to discover through scientific\ninvestigation, or (inclusive or) through an analysis of what words\nmean, or through any other method, what the nature of, say, Justice \nis\u2014compare the ways in which philosophers and scientists work to\ndiscover what, e.g., gold, or red, or justice, is. Ultimately, then,\nthe answer to any \u2018what is X?\u2019 question will be\nsome specific formula unearthed at the end of much study. According to\nthis line of reasoning, the self-predication statements in the texts\nare promissory notes, shorthand for what will turn out to be the fully\narticulated definition. Plato is thus committed to there being Forms\nwhose nature or essence will ultimately be discovered. To say that\n\u2018Justice is just\u2019 is then to stake a claim to the ultimate\ndiscovery of the nature of Justice. The problem is that the fully\narticulated linguistic definition, when it is ultimately discovered,\nwill turn out to be complex. For instance, Heat, one thing, is mean\nmolecular kinetic energy, a seemingly complex notion. So in Plato we\nfind (Republic, 441d) that Justice is Doing One's\nOwn, that a Name is (Cratylus, 388b) a tool that is\ninformative and separates nature, or, though Plato never says it,\nthat Human is rational bipedal animal. Since philosophical and\n(scientific progress) is supposed to teach not that Justice is just but\nwhat Justice is, at some level at least Forms cannot be considered to\nbe utterly and strictly simple. The problem is that given just two\npredication relations, it is unclear whether Plato thinks that Forms\npartake of the properties to which they are related or whether they are\nthose properties.\n",
