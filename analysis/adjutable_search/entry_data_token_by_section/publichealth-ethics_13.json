The Nuffield Council on Bioethics has\nprovided an influential \u201cintervention ladder\u201d (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2007), which effectively rank orders various\ntypes of interventions on a continuum that is meant to function as a\nguide to the acceptability and justification of public health\npolicies. The ladder is anchored at one end by what is presented as\nthe least intrusive option, doing nothing, and at the other end by\nwhat is presented as the most intrusive option, eliminating choice\naltogether (as in compulsory isolation). The Council makes plain that\nall rungs on the ladder, including doing nothing, require\njustification and that the ladder is to be taken only as a tool in the\nmoral analysis of public health policies.\n\n\n\nMeasure\nExamples \n\nEliminate Choice\nquarantining individuals infected with Ebola \n\nRestrict Choice\ntrans fat ban; seatbelt and helmet laws; vaccine mandates;\nwater fluoridation \n\nGuide Choice by Disincentives\nsoda tax; cigarette tax; efforts to engender social norms\nagainst soda consumption \n\nGuide Choice by Incentives\ntax breaks for those who bike to work; pharmacy coupons in\nexchange for getting vaccinated against seasonal influenza \n\nGuide Choice by Changing the Default (also known as\n\u2018nudging\u2019)\nmaking salads the default side whereas fries have to be\nrequested; requiring that sugary foods be placed further back in\ngrocery stores \n\nEnable Choice\noffer free smoking cessation classes; ensure access to clean\nwater \n\nProvide Information\neducational campaigns; requirements for food labels\n\n\nDo nothing\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n\nTable. Intervention Ladder\n(Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Policy Process and Practice, 2007)\n\n\nWhile useful, the Nuffield ladder has at least three problems. First,\nthe ladder does not canvas all of the paradigmatic interventions of\npublic health. Surveillance, for instance, does not fit under any of\nthe types of measures that appear on the ladder. Yet public health\nagencies engage in surveillance extensively; it is integral to\npromoting and protecting public health. And surveillance activities,\ntoo, raise difficult justificatory questions about citizen\u2019s\nrights against intrusions by the state (Lee 2019; Taylor 2019;\nFairchild and Bayer 2004).\n\nSecond, continua like the Nuffield Ladder oversimplify the complex\nimpact of interventions on choice and liberty and on relations between\ncitizens and the state. When public health authorities do nothing, it\ndoes not follow that choice and liberty are necessarily the winners.\nFor example, with no government intervention to serve as a counter\nballast, private sector actors in the pharmaceutical, food, and energy\nsectors may undermine both individual choice and health through\nmisinformation, manipulative advertising, or anti-competitive\npractices. Similarly, incentives are not always less restrictive of\nchoice than disincentives, and some object to both because they are\nmanipulative and autonomy-undermining (Quong 2011). Nudges and health\npromotion campaigns also raise concerns about unwarranted state\nintrusion, depending on the context. For example, ad campaigns that\nare transparently sponsored by public health agencies, such as those\nto prevent transmission of influenza by promoting personal infection\ncontrol practices or reduce obesity by encouraging exercise and\nhealthy eating, do not raise the same moral issues as the embedding of\nanti-drug or food messages in the storylines of entertainment\ntelevision programming by these same authorities (FCC 2000; Forbes\n2000 (Other Internet Resources); Goodman 2006; Krauthammer 2000; Kurtz\nand Waxman 2000). Much like corporate advertising, these embedded\nmessages, as well as some nudges, may succeed in shaping\npeople\u2019s preferences without their awareness. These undetected\neffects lead to questions about whether such interventions constitute\ninsidious manipulation by government and, as a consequence whether\nthey are really less objectionable than more overt interventions like\ntaxing or restricting liberty.\n\nThird, the Nuffield Ladder ranks types of public health measures on\nonly one set of considerations that is relevant to justifying the\nimpact of that measure on choice and liberty. Justifications of\npolicies must also include an assessment of the benefit produced by\nthe intervention as discussed in Section 3.1, as well as\nconsiderations of who benefits and who is harmed by alternative\ngovernment responses (including doing nothing) in ways that are\nsensitive to the range of worries about justice raised in section\n2.\n\nThe Nuffield Ladder is ultimately motivated by concerns about the\nappropriate scope of state activity, and how the rights or interests\nof citizens should restrict such activities. One helpful framing of\nthis concern comes from familiar discussions of political legitimacy\n(see the entry on\n political legitimacy).\n In these discussions, there are typically three claims that are\npresented as though they are in tension:\n\nExercises of political power interfere with free and equal\npersons \u2013 some of whom do not consent to such interference.\nThere is a moral presumption against interfering with\nnon-consenting free and equal persons.\nPublic health interventions are (often) exercises of political\npower.\n\n\nThe use of \u2018interference\u2019 is intentionally broad and can\nbe specified to be more or less inclusive. As we saw from the Nuffield\nLadder, the most paradigmatic cases of interference are laws\nrestricting or eliminating individual choice. Arguably, however, other\ninterventions interfere with free and equal persons, such as\ndisincentivizing or incentivizing choice, altering choice\narchitecture, or conducting surveillance. Others charge that even\nsubsidized smoking cessation programs funded by taxpayer money\nconstitute an interference with free and equal persons on the grounds\nthat taxation is coercive \u2013 and so constitutes interference\n(Quong 2011).\n\nThe conception of \u2018free and equal persons\u2019 is also open to\nmultiple specifications (see the entry on\n liberalism).\n The basic idea behind the \u2018free\u2019 qualifier is to limit\ndiscussion to individuals who have the requisite psychological\nabilities to govern their lives in accordance with their values or\nplan of life. Children and, arguably, adults with severe cognitive\ndisabilities do not count as free in this sense, and so the tension\nbetween (1) and (2) does not arise for them as straightforwardly. The\n\u2018equal\u2019 qualifier is meant to convey that free persons are\nmoral equals, and no person has a natural right to govern others.\n\nResolving the tension between (1) and (2) is not unique to public\nhealth; it is widely treated as a central problem for theorists of\npolitical morality generally, especially by those who consider\nthemselves liberals. Nonetheless, as (3) indicates, the tension\nbetween (1) and (2) frequently arises in the context of public health\npractice and policy. We now consider a variety of responses to this\ntension.\n3.2.1 Paternalism\n\nPerhaps no issue has driven more debates about the legitimacy of\npublic health interventions than paternalism, and when, if ever,\npaternalism is morally permissible. There is no consensus on how to\nbest define paternalism, and resolving disputes about this definition\nis beyond the scope of this entry (see the\n entry on paternalism).\n But paternalism is classically understood as successfully interfering\nwith the liberty of action of a person, against her will, to protect\nor promote her welfare (Dworkin 2005; Feinberg\n 1986)[21].\n \u2018Strong\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 paternalism, the variant\nof paternalism that is most controversial, typically refers to\ninterference with someone\u2019s informed and value-based preferences\nfor the sake of advancing that person\u2019s best interests or\nwelfare. To illustrate with a case, imagine someone who chooses to\nride a motorcycle without a helmet rather than with a helmet despite\nknowing the greater risk of injury and death that accompanies this\nchoice because the person values the enhanced sense of freedom they\nexperience when riding bareheaded. In this case, interference with\nthis decision for their own good by issuing fines that are ultimately\nbacked by loss of driving privileges or some other significant penalty\nwould be a case of strong or hard paternalism.\n\nStrong or hard paternalism is quite controversial in all domains, and\nliberals rarely claim that interventions can be justified on strong or\nhard paternalistic grounds when it comes to autonomous, competent, and\ninformed persons. And very few public health interventions are\njustified exclusively or even primarily on grounds of hard or strong\npaternalism. Even proponents of motorcycle helmet laws often eschew\npaternalistic arguments in favor of arguments about the costs the\ncyclist imposes on others by riding without a helmet (Jones and Bayer\n2007).\n\nA distinct class of paternalistic arguments more popular with public\nhealth advocates appeals to soft paternalism or weak paternalism. Soft\npaternalism concerns interference with individuals to ensure that they\nare not acting on false beliefs when endangering themselves such as\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s influential example of the person who intends\nto cross an unstable bridge, when it is unclear whether he knows that\nthe bridge is dangerous. In this case, to engage in soft paternalism\nwould be to make sure that the individual knows that the bridge is\nunstable and if that person does, allowing them to cross nonetheless.\nWeak paternalism includes correcting more general failures to take\none\u2019s means to one\u2019s ends due to, say, weakness of will\n(Dworkin 2005). Both weak and soft paternalism share the feature that\nthey are interferences with choices that are compromised by ignorance\nor non-voluntariness.\n\nA challenge for both soft and especially weak paternalism is how to\nrespond when the person who is to be interfered with voices or holds a\npreference that is inconsistent with the ends pursued on her behalf. A\ngeneral view is that preferences are not entitled to robust respect if\nformed under conditions that significantly compromise their autonomy\nor voluntariness, such as cognitive disability or immaturity and, in\nvery limited cases, ignorance or false\n beliefs.[22]\n Although rarely employed as a justification in public health,\nadaptive preferences formed in response to difficult or unjust\ncircumstances are viewed by some as being less autonomous and\nconsequently more subject to permissible interference than preferences\nformed under just or normal background\n conditions[23]\n (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on autonomy).\n\nMore typically in public health, the obligation to respect preferences\nis challenged by appeal to other claimed compromises of autonomy or\nvoluntariness. For example, public health interventions aimed at\nadolescents, such as minimum age requirements for the purchasing of\nalcohol, tobacco products, and driver\u2019s licenses, appeal to\nviews about the immaturity of judgment of adolescents whose brains are\nstill developing and who have limited life experience. For adults as\nwell as teenagers, claims about the addictive properties of some\nsubstances, as well as the power of corporate marketing strategies to\nmanipulate preferences, are often used to justify interference. For\nexample, this line of reasoning has been used to help defend some\ndrug, alcohol, and tobacco policies, as well as policies to restrict\naccess to sugar-sweetened\n beverages.[24]\n\nIt warrants emphasizing that in all these cases, justified\ninterference would be based on a finding of significantly compromised\nautonomy, competence, or rationality in the formation or continued\nholding of particular preferences. This should not be confused with\ninterference based on the content of the preferences. Only the former\nwould be justifiable under soft or weak paternalism, whereas the\nlatter would constitute hard or strong paternalism.\n\nThese demarcations are not, of course, as clear in real life as they\nare in theory, and in practice, the content of preferences is often\nprecisely what is appealed to in illustrating that a particular\npreference is compromised. However, by and large, what distinguishes\nweak paternalism from strong paternalism is the requirement that the\ndecision or preference be fundamentally compromised, and not simply\nthat it be mistaken or ignorant. This principled distinction remains\nimportant not least because it reflects a difference in approach or\nattitude: in the case of hard or strong paternalism, the interference\nis based on the content of a preference that, purportedly, does not\nreflect what is in the preference holder\u2019s\n interest.[25]\n In the case of soft or weak paternalism, persons might hold all\nmanner of preferences not in their best interest that are nonetheless\nnot justifiably interfered with because the relevant compromising\nconditions do not obtain.\n\nDespite the general tendency to eschew paternalistic arguments in\npublic health ethics, there have been some notable defenses of\nunabashed paternalism in recent years. However, the exact form of\npaternalism that these authors defend varies (Conly 2013, 2014; Hanna\n2019). To take one prominent defender of paternalism, Sarah Conly\nappears to defend weak paternalism insofar as she claims the\nappropriate goal of paternalism is to enable as many individuals as\npossible to act on their genuine values or higher-order preferences.\nFor instance, Conly argues in favor of various paternalist forms of\npublic health legislation, such as banning trans-fats, because\nindividuals value their health more than they value consuming\ntrans-fats (Conly 2013, 2014).\n3.2.2 John Stuart Mill, Liberty, and the Harm Principle\n\nLikely no classic philosophical work is cited more often in the public\nhealth ethics literature than John Stuart Mill\u2019s influential essay,\n\u201cOn Liberty\u201d (Mill 1869). In that essay, Mill articulates\nand defends what has come to be called \u2018the harm\nprinciple,\u2019 although Mill himself never used the term. The harm\nprinciple has been interpreted as holding that the only justification\nfor interfering with the liberty of an individual, against her will,\nis to prevent direct, non-consensual harm to others. The harm\nprinciple is used to both challenge and support public health\npolicies.\n\nPolicies that interfere with conduct that does not produce direct harm\nto others are sometimes criticized as government overreach in virtue\nof failing to satisfy the harm principle (Jones and Bayer 2007; Quong\n2011; Flanigan 2014b). For instance, opponents of motorcycle helmet\nlaws in Massachusetts explicitly invoked Mill when pressing their case\nin court (Jones and Bayer 2007, 211). Conversely, the harm principle\nis invoked to justify policies where harm to others is a paramount\nconcern, paradigmatically for various infectious disease control\ninterventions such as quarantine, isolation, and compulsory treatment\n(Flanigan 2014a; Holland 2007; Navin 2016; Giubilini 2019). In liberal\ndemocracies, the harm principle is often viewed as the most compelling\njustification for public health policies that interfere with\nindividual liberty. For example, some claim that in the United States\nit was not until the public became persuaded of the harmful effects of\n\u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d that the first significant intrusion\ninto smoking practices \u2013 the banning of smoking in public places\n\u2013 became politically possible.\n\nAs with all such moral and political principles, questions remain\nabout the specification of the harm principle. There are questions\nabout the nature of harm, which is typically understood as setting\nback the interests of individuals in which they have rights, including\neconomic interests. How significant must the threat of harm be, with\nregard to both its likelihood and\n magnitude?[26]\n Are physical harms to the health of others to be weighted more than\neconomic harms or other setbacks to interests? It is undeniable that\nindividuals have much broader and more multi-dimensional interests\nthan narrowly self-directed physical ones. In that sense, it is not\nunreasonable to have a fairly expansive understanding of\n\u201charm\u201d in a public health context. And given how\nself-harming behavior influences others, some might question the\nusefulness of sharply delineating self-regarding and other-regarding\nharm. Others, however, charge that to interpret harm in this way is\ntoo expansive (Jones and Bayer 2007).\n\nFor instance, consider the claim that one harms others by riding a\nmotorcycle without a helmet because, in so doing, cyclists risk\ndiverting important medical resources and personnel to the care of\npeople who get into accidents without helmets. Some have charged that\nthis construal of harm is unduly broad and, accordingly, this\nconstrual of harm would entail that the harm principle permits various\ngovernment interventions that it should prohibit (Jones and Bayer\n2007). Actions that are primarily self-harming frequently raise\nconcerns about how broadly to interpret the harm principle.\n\nBecause the impact of J.S. Mill on public health ethics cannot be\noverstated, it is also important to recognize that Mill does not hold\nthat in the formulation of public policies all liberty interests enjoy\nan equal presumption in their favor. Mill distinguishes interests that\nare so important that they are immune from state interference,\ninterests that enjoy a presumption in favor of liberty, and interests\nthat enjoy no such presumption. The harm principle figures prominently\nonly when the second kind of liberty interest is involved. Some public\nhealth interventions target the third kind of liberty interest, which\nis not privileged in the same way. For example, is not clear that the\ninterest individuals have in eating foods with trans-fats is an\ninterest that enjoys a presumption in favor of liberty (Powers, Faden\nand Saghai 2012).\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the harm principle has also\nenjoyed more attention in public health ethics in recent years because\nsome of Mill\u2019s arguments have been subject to increased\nscrutiny. One of Mill\u2019s arguments rests on the claim that\nothers, including the State, are not as well-positioned to know the\nbest interests of the individual as the individual herself, and the\nindividual has the greatest interest in her own well-being.\nAccordingly, restricting the individual\u2019s liberty for her own\ngood will typically fail. Yet in recent years, some have drawn on\nfindings in behavioral economics and social psychology to challenge\nthis empirical claim about our self-knowledge, incentives, and\ncompetence at pursuing our own interests \u2013 and thereby challenge\na claim that underlies the harm principle. This challenge can be\nspecified in various ways. One specification is that we are quite bad\nat means-end reasoning due to ignorance; many would like to lead\nhealthy lives but lack knowledge of nutrition. Another version of this\nis that individuals are bad at taking the requisite means to their\nends due to various cognitive biases, such as temporal discounting, or\nlack of executive function. Individuals often know what is in their\nbest interest, but they still succumb to temptation or otherwise act\nin ways that, arguably, are not conducive to what they as well as\nothers appreciate is in their interest (Conly 2013, 2014; Hanna 2019;\nSunstein 2013; Thaler and Sunstein 2003; 2008).\n\nNeedless to say, whether these empirical claims are correct will turn\non how we specify the requisite conditions for knowledge of\none\u2019s own best interest; what constitutes successfully acting on\none\u2019s best interests; and whether various cognitive biases do,\nin fact, prevent individuals from acting on their own best interests.\nMoreover, as we will see in the following section, even if we grant\nthat individuals are subject to the relevant shortcomings, this might\nnot undercut Mill\u2019s more general point.\n3.2.3 The Liberty Tradition\n\nRegardless of how we interpret the harm principle or whether we accept\nthe various arguments for it, some liberals have appealed to the moral\nsignificance of individual liberty to argue that various liberal\ngovernments currently overstep their mandate when it comes to\npromoting public health. To borrow a label from Eric Mack and Gerald\nGaus, this class of views constitutes \u2018the liberty\ntradition.\u2019 (Mack and Gaus 2004; Brennan 2018). The liberty\ntradition includes (non-left and anti-paternalist) libertarianism and\nvarious forms of classical liberalism. In recent years, some advocates\nof the liberty tradition have become increasingly interested in public\nhealth ethics. Their views are distinctive insofar as they place a\nsignificant normative premium on individual liberty, and they\ntypically do not countenance public health interventions based on\nprinciples of justice other than principles of transfer or repair.\nMoreover, these theorists frequently call out perceived excesses on\nthe part of the State\u2019s pursuit of public health.\n\nOne argument that frequently appears in this literature turns on\nskepticism that government actors are sufficiently knowledgeable,\ncompetent, or well-motivated to effectively improve the public\u2019s\nhealth. In other words, some object to a wide variety of public health\ninterventions because of empirical claims about government actors,\nincluding those who attempt to promote public health. While we have\nseen that some challenge the presumption in favor of liberty by\nproviding evidence that individuals are not, in fact, especially good\nat pursuing their own interests \u2013 due to ignorance, lack of\nwillpower, or cognitive bias \u2013 those in the liberty tradition\nsometimes counter that even if we grant these empirical claims, it\ndoes not follow that governments are any better. In other words, to\nshow that governments may interfere with free and equal persons, one\nwould need to show that policy can better secure the interests of\nindividuals than individuals themselves can. And when it comes to\npublic health interventions aimed at protecting individuals from\nthemselves, these theorists claim that we should doubt that government\nactors are up to the task (Brennan 2017; Epstein 2004; Flanigan\n2014b).\n\nThe argument so far rests on empirical claims about the questionable\ncompetence and motivation of government actors, but many (if not most)\nin the liberty tradition also oppose such interventions on normative\ngrounds as well. That is, even if public health officials were\ncompetent, well-motivated, and knew the interests of individuals\nbetter than individuals themselves, those in the liberty tradition\nobject that this still would not justify various public health\npolicies aimed at improving the health of citizens (see Brennan 2018;\nEpstein 2004; Flanigan 2014b; Quong 2011; Anomaly 2011; Gaus 2010).\nThis point can be summarized with the following quote from David\nEstlund (although Estlund uses it in a markedly different context):\n\u201cYou might be right, but who made you boss?\u201d (Estlund\n2007). There are a variety of rationales for this normative\nconclusion; some appeal to natural rights or broadly deontological\nviews, whereas others appeal to requirements of public justification\n(more on this below). Others still draw on consequentialist reasoning\nand appear to argue on grounds of efficiency or aggregate benefit.\nThat is, one could grant that overall benefit or efficiency would\njustify public health interventions but deny that many public health\ninterventions are, in fact, efficient in the relevant ways (Brennan\n2018).\n\nThe common thread in the liberty tradition is the moral presumption in\nfavor of individual liberty. This thread manifests in a variety of\nways in the context of public health. Some object to the ways in which\npublic health authorities provide information to citizens, such as\n\u2018traffic light\u2019 labels on foods, or especially graphic\nimages that depict the deleterious effects of smoking cigarettes\n(Bonotti 2014). Others in the liberty tradition object to\ngovernment-created disincentives, such as soda taxes (Anomaly 2011,\n2012). And, of course, proponents of the liberty tradition object to\nrestrictions of choice. For instance, some charge that regulatory\nbodies, such as the FDA, illegitimately restrict individual liberty\nwhen they prohibit individuals from purchasing and using drugs that\nthe FDA deems unsafe (Anomaly 2011, 2012; Flanigan 2014b, 2017;\nEpstein 2004).\n\nAs with the harm principle, those in the liberty tradition are not\nnecessarily opposed to public health measures that prohibit people\nfrom harming others. Yet we might wonder whether the liberty\ntradition\u2019s premium on individual liberty constrains various\npublic health interventions that its proponents wish to endorse. An\ninteresting boundary case concerns whether members of the liberty\ntradition can endorse vaccine mandates, especially for the\nmeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine (Bernstein 2017; Brennan 2018; Flanigan\n2014a; Giubilini 2019; Navin 2015). Collectively, parents who delay or\nrefuse vaccination can impose considerable risk on others,\ncollectively. Individually, however, each unvaccinated child does not\nimpose much risk. Given this low risk of harm, it would seem that the\nmost natural argument in defense of mandatory vaccination would be to\njustify a restriction of individual parental liberty for the sake of\nsome sort of overall benefit. Insofar as libertarians view\ninterference with free and equal persons for promoting overall benefit\nas illegitimate, however, this argument is not available for them. And\nself-identified libertarians outside of academia have objected to\nvaccine mandates as unjustified infringements on individual liberty.\n(For instance, in 2015, Senator Rand Paul argued against vaccine\nmandates because \u201cThe state doesn\u2019t own your children.\nParents own their children.\u201d) But this is a striking conclusion,\none that arguably counts against the plausibility of libertarianism\nrather than against the legitimacy of vaccine mandates (Brennan 2018;\nBernstein 2017).\n\nPerhaps in response to this position, some self-described libertarians\nhave attempted to defend vaccine mandates by arguing that allowing\none\u2019s child to go unvaccinated violates the rights of others\n(Flanigan 2014a; Brennan 2018). If their arguments succeed,\nlibertarians can place a premium on individual liberty without being\ncommitted to the ostensibly unpalatable implication that vaccine\nmandates are illegitimate. In reply, however, some have objected that\nif vaccine delayal or refusal violates rights in virtue of imposing\nrisk of harm on others, then so too do many other activities. Think of\nthe risks associated with owning guns or private pools or driving\nlarge, fuel-inefficient cars. If this is correct, then a libertarian\ndefense of vaccine mandates is either unsuccessful or entails the\npermissibility of widespread government restrictions of various\nliberties, thereby raising the question as to whether the defense\ngenuinely counts as libertarian (Bernstein 2017).\n3.2.4 Libertarian Paternalism\n\nSome have sought a third way between paternalism and the liberty\ntradition. The proponents of this third way describe their view as\n\u2018libertarian paternalism.\u2019 (Thaler and Sunstein 2003;\nThaler and Sunstein 2008; Sunstein 2013). Libertarian paternalism aims\nto be responsive to our well-documented shortcomings at pursuing our\nown interests while also assuaging the liberty tradition\u2019s\nconcerns about paternalistic measures that disincentivize, restrict,\nor eliminate choice. \u2018Nudges,\u2019 understood typically as\ninterventions in choice architecture, are the focus of libertarian\npaternalism. And public health policy and liberal governments have\nincreasingly employed nudges to influence health behaviors in\ndesirable directions. Libertarian paternalism endorses interventions\nby planners (such as public health authorities) in the environmental\narchitecture in which individuals decide and act in order to make it\neasier for people to behave in ways that are in their best interests\n(including their health), provided two conditions are satisfied\n(Thaler and Sunstein 2003; Thaler and Sunstein 2008). First,\nindividuals are steered by these interventions in ways that make them\nbetter off, as judged by themselves. Thus, in libertarian paternalism,\nthere is no attempt to contravene the will of individuals, in contrast\nto what some hold to be a necessary feature of paternalism. Second,\nthe interventions must not overly burden individuals who want to\nexercise their freedom in ways that run counter to their own welfare.\nThaler and Sunstein suggest, for example, that salads rather than\nFrench fries could be made the default \u201cside\u201d on\nrestaurant menus, with diners free to request fries if that remains\ntheir preference. By nudging people to eat salads, public health\noutcomes would improve, but this intervention does not objectionably\ninterfere with individual liberty.\n\nA key conceptual question about paternalism is whether the\ninterference with individual liberty must be against the person\u2019s will\n(Beauchamp 2010). If this feature is a necessary condition of\npaternalism, then libertarian paternalism is inappropriately titled.\nSimilarly, we might wonder whether the view is genuinely libertarian\nin any informative sense since libertarianism is concerned to protect\nindividual liberty not only from coercion but also from other forms of\ninterference \u2013 most notably manipulation. Both supporters and\nopponents of paternalistic interventions and those in favor of them\nhave charged that choice architecture is manipulative (Conly 2013;\nQuong 2011).\n\nFrom the standpoint of public health ethics, however, whether\nlibertarian paternalism is appropriately titled is less important than\nany moral issues it raises and how it is justified. There is a large\nand still-growing literature on the ethics of nudges, much of it\nfocusing on health (Engelen 2019; Levy 2017; Moles 2015; Muldoon 2018;\nNoggle 2018; Saghai 2013a; Saghai 2013b; Soccia 2019; Quigley 2013;\nHollands et al. 2013; Quong 2011).\n\nThose who believe that nudging is manipulative and that manipulation\nis objectionable for the same sorts of reasons as coercion is\nobjectionable do not see libertarian paternalism as a viable middle\npath between paternalism and the liberty tradition. Instead, they\nargue that it is simply a different form of paternalism, one that\nraises the same or very similar concerns about respect for individuals\nas coercive paternalism (see Quong 2011; Noggle 2018; Soccia 2019).\nMoreover, as noted above in the discussion of the liberty tradition,\nsome have granted that individuals are not good at the relevant kinds\nof decision-making but deny that government actors are sufficiently\ncompetent or well-motivated to design nudges that do more good than\nharm. Whether this objection to libertarian paternalism sticks is a\ncomplicated empirical question. But insofar as one accepts that\nlibertarian paternalism is manipulative, it does not avoid worries\nfrom those in the liberty tradition.\n\nOthers, by contrast, see libertarian paternalism as too restrictive in\nits conditions (and therefore too weak) to be applicable or adequate\nfor many public health contexts (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2007;\nUbel 2009; Conly 2013; Conly 2014; Menard 2010). For instance, some\ncharge that libertarian paternalism is so concerned with individual\ndecision-making that it is not well-suited to producing public goods\nassociated with public health, nor is it effective at removing\nunderlying social determinants of bad public health outcomes (Menard\n2010). And some restrictions of liberty have yielded significant\npublic health benefits, such as seatbelt or motorcycle laws, or bans\non the use of trans fats (Conly 2013; Conly 2014; Menard 2010). In\nother words, those unmoved by the objections to restricting individual\nliberty for the sake of realizing public health gains find the\nlibertarian paternalist proposal to be too concessive to the liberty\ntradition. Because policies that conform to libertarian paternalist\ncriteria are too limited in their effects, libertarian paternalism is\nunable to accomplish central tasks of public health \u2013 and\ntherefore does not satisfy those who reject the liberty tradition.\n",
