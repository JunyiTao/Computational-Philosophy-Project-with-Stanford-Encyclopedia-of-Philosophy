    "main_text": "Becoming Parents || Genetic accounts\n4.1 Genetic accounts\n\nGenetic theories ground parenthood in the relation of direct genetic\nderivation. Geneticism thus places parenthood in the nexus of other\nfamilial relations, such as being a sibling, cousin, and so on, which\nappear to have a genetic basis and which appear (at least to some) to\ncome along with certain moral rights and responsibilities.\n\nHall (1999) defends geneticism by appeal to the Lockean notion of\nself-ownership. Since genetic parents own the genetic material from\nwhich the child is constituted, they have a prima facie parental claim\nto the child. There are a number of problems with this line of\nargument (Kolers & Bayne 2001) and it is an argument that Locke\nhimself rejected (Franklin-Hall 2012). First, it subsumes parental\nrelations under property relations, by attempting to derive a claim\nabout parenthood from premises involving claims about ownership. The\nplausibility of this derivation is based on emphasizing parental\nrights associated with exclusivity and authority, and downplaying\nparental responsibilities. Those responsibilities\u2014to both child\nand community\u2014pull sharply against a property-based analysis of\nparenthood. Second, taking self-ownership seriously entails that\nchildren own themselves, and this surely defeats any proprietary claim\nthat their parents might have in them (Archard 1990). Third, genetic\nparents do not provide the material from which the child is\nconstituted in utero; that derives from the gestational mother, not\nthe genetic parents (Silver 2001). Of course, the child\u2019s\ngenetic make-up structures that matter, but to argue for the priority\nof the genetic over the gestational contribution is to argue for the\npriority of form over matter, and it is not obvious that this can be\ndone.\n\nOther arguments for geneticism derive from considering paternity, in\nthat direct genetic derivation appears to provide the most plausible\naccount of the basis of fatherhood. Several recent legal cases have\noverturned adoptions on the grounds that the estranged father,\nunidentified at the time of birth, has returned to claim the child\n(Rosenman 1995, Shanley 1995). Supporters of these decisions endorse\nthe view that unalienated genetic claims to children can override\nmonths or even years of rearing by the adoptive parents, as well as\nthe earlier failure of the father to claim the child. Similarly, in\n\u201csurrogacy\u201d cases, many writers have argued\u2014or\nsimply assumed\u2014that a genetic father may have his own child by\ncontracting with a surrogate mother. This seems to presuppose a\ngenetic account of paternity; and it is a small step from a genetic\naccount of paternity to a genetic account of parenthood. One need\nappeal only to the principle of \u201cparity,\u201d according to\nwhich the sort of relationship that makes one person a parent suffices\nto make anyone else a parent (Bayne & Kolers 2003; Austin\n2004).\n",
