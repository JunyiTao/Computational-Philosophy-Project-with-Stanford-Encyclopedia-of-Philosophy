Moral Motivation and Experimental Psychology\n\nWork in experimental psychology may also shape how we understand and\nanswer our questions about moral motivation. A number of philosophers\nhave recently brought work in psychology to bear on questions in\nmetaethics and on the question of moral motivation in particular. Such\nwork has been argued to have implications for the nature of motivation\ngenerally, for the debate between motivational internalists and\nexternalists, and for the plausibility of various philosophical\naccounts of the nature of moral motivation. \n\nSchroeder et al. sketch what they describe as caricatures of four\npossible theories of moral motivation, which they label\ninstrumentalist, cognitivist, sentimentalist, and personalist, and\nargue that \u201ctheories of morally worthy motivation that best fit\nthe current scientific picture are ones that owe much more to Hume or\nAristotle than to Kant\u201d\n (72).[14]\n According to the instrumentalist, \u201cpeople are motivated when\nthey form beliefs about how to satisfy preexisting [intrinsic]\ndesires\u201d (74), which lead in turn to the formation of\nnonintrinsic desires to take specific actions aimed at satisfying\ntheir intrinsic desires. When a person has an intrinsic desire, D, and\ncomes to believe that \u03c6-ing will satisfy D, she comes to desire\n(nonintrinsically) to \u03c6. On the instrumentalist view, commonly\ncalled \u201cHumean,\u201d the specifically moral character of\nmotivation comes from an intrinsic desire to do what one judges to be\nright. In contrast to the instrumentalist, the cognitivist holds that\nmoral motivation begins, not with desires, but with beliefs about\nwhich actions are right. Such beliefs motivate independently of\npreexisting intrinsic desires. Morally worthy action arises not from\ndesires, at least not in the first instance, but from moral judgments\n(76). The sentimentalist sees the emotions as playing a central role\nin moral motivation, and for an action to be the result of moral\nmotivation, certain emotions must cause that action. The right kind of\nemotions are things like compassion or sympathy (77). Finally, the\npersonalist sees the source of moral motivation in morally good\ncharacter, more specifically, in the virtues. \u201cGood character\ninvolves knowledge of the good, wanting what is good for its own sake,\nlong-standing emotional dispositions that favor good action, and\nlong-standing habits of responding to one\u2019s knowledge, desires\nand emotions with good actions\u201d (77). Moral action begins when a\nperson\u2019s sensitivity to moral patterns and moral heuristics\n(such as that lying tends to be bad) leads her to judge that an action\nwould be good, which engages her long-standing emotional dispositions\nand habits, thereby resulting in moral motivation. \n\nAccording to Schroeder et al., each of these views \u201cpresuppose\ncommitments regarding the nature of psychological states such as\nbeliefs, desires, choices, emotions, and so on, together with\ncommitments regarding the functional and causal roles they play\u201d\n(79). Because these commitments are not only philosophical but also\nempirical, they go on to summarize the empirical\nwork\u2014\u201ctextbook neuroscience\u201d\u2014on the\nneurophysiology of motivation and to assess the implications of the\nscience for these four philosophical views about moral motivation.\n\n\nThe instrumentalist view, they argue, fares well given the\nneuroscience, as does the personalist account. In contrast, the\ncognitivist account of moral motivation runs into trouble \u201csince\nour moral behavior does not appear to be under the control of\ncognitive states alone independently of desire\u201d (106). The\nsentimentalist\u2019s view likewise runs into difficulty\n\u201cbecause the emotional system, while closely linked to the\nsystem underlying voluntary action, will turn out to be nonetheless\ndistinct from it unless emotions are themselves built in part from\ndesires\u201d (106). Schroeder et al. acknowledge that our current\nunderstanding of the neuroscience is incomplete and that responses can\nbe offered to the criticisms that they make (106). Nevertheless, they\nsuggest that attention to the neuroscience \u201ccould serve to\nconstrain future theorizing about the structure of moral\nagency\u2026\u201d (107).\n\nRoskies (2003) attempts to draw conclusions about a particular kind of\ninternalism about moral motivation by focusing on empirical evidence\ndrawn from patients with damage to the ventromedial (VM) cortex. More\nprecisely, she argues against the view that moral belief entails moral\nmotivation, a view she calls \u201cmotive-internalism\u201d, which\nis the view called \u201cstrong internalism\u201d in section 3.2 As\nshe describes it, motive-internalism is the view that\n\u201cmotivation is intrinsic to, or a necessary component of moral\nbelief or judgment\u201d (52). The person who sincerely believes that\nshe ought to F is thereby motivated, to some degree, to F. The\nexternalist holds, in contrast, that moral belief does not entail\nmoral motivation; a person can believe that she ought to F, while\nlacking any motivation to F. Roskies explains that the internalist\nclaim involves necessity, intrinsicness, and specificity. According to\nthe motive-internalist, it is a necessary truth that\nmotivation accompanies moral belief or judgment, and so it is true\n\u201cof any agent capable of moral beliefs\u201d (52). The\nintrinsicness of motive-internalism consists in the idea that\nthe connection between moral belief or judgment and motivation holds\nbecause of the content of the moral belief, rather than because of\nsomething unrelated to the content of that belief. As for\nspecificity, motive-internalism sees moral beliefs as\ndifferent from other kinds of beliefs, which are not intrinsically\nmotivating (52). \n\nAccording to Roskies, the \u201cmotive-internalist\u201d faces a\ndilemma: either her internalist thesis is too weak and so is\nphilosophically uninteresting, or it is strong enough to be\nphilosophically interesting but also \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d\n(51). On the first horn of the dilemma, the internalist thesis is too\nweak and so is philosophically uninteresting. Roskies illustrates this\nhorn of the dilemma with Smith\u2019s view that there is a necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation, except when an agent\nfails to be practically rational. This thesis requires a specification\nof what it is to be practically rational, but if being practically\nrational amounts to desiring to act as one judges best, she contends,\nthen the thesis is trivial. It is not a strong claim about a necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation but a mere\ndefinitional claim about practical rationality. What\u2019s more, it\nlacks specificity, because it applies as well to what an agent judges\nto be nonmorally best. Other version of motive-internalism likewise\nrender the thesis trivial (53\u201355).\n\nOn the other horn of the dilemma, the internalist claim is\nphilosophically interesting but false. Here, Roskies argues that\npersons with injury to the VM cortex are a \u201cwalking\ncounterexample\u201d to internalism. As Roskies describes them, such\npatients \u201cappear cognitively normal on a wide spectrum of\nstandard psychological tests, including those measuring intelligence\nand reasoning abilities\u201d, however, they \u201call appear to\nhave particular difficulty in acting in accordance with social mores\ndespite their retained ability to judge appropriately in such\nsituations\u201d (56). The condition of these patients has been\nreferred to as \u201cacquired sociopathy\u201d. According to\nRoskies, VM patients are able to \u201creason morally at a normal\nlevel\u201d and their moral claims \u201caccord with those of\nnormals\u201d, but they fail to reliably act as normal persons do\nand, what\u2019s more, \u201cseem to lack appropriate motivational\nand emotional responses\u201d (57). VM patients do not exhibit the\nskin-conductive response (SCR) to emotionally-charged stimuli that\nnormal persons exhibit, which Roskies take to be evidence of the\nabsence of motivation. VM patients allegedly present a counterexample\nto motive-internalism because they have mastery of moral terms and\nappear to make sincere moral judgments, while lacking any motivation\nto act in accordance with them (59). \n\nVarious arguments have been offered against the alleged results of\nempirical findings for motivational internalism. Some have argued that\nVM patients lack moral concepts (Kennett and Fine 2007), that VM\npatients make moral judgments only in what R. M Hare (1963) called the\n\u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (Kennett and Fine 2007), that VM\npatients are, in fact motivated when they make moral judgments\n(Kennett and Fine 2007), that the evidence offered for the claim that\nVM patients make moral judgments without experiencing emotion\n\u201cis not decisive\u201d (Prinz 2015), that we have reasons to\ndoubt that VM patients have moral beliefs (Cholbi 2006), and that VM\npatients have impaired agency and so do not make genuine moral\njudgments, which require agency (Gerrans and Kennett 2010). In varying\nways, these responses challenge whether it is conceptually coherent to\ntreat cases of VM patients as cases of amoralism. Insofar as the\ndisagreement concerns the conceptual coherence of amoralism, it is\nuncertain how appealing to the empirical literature helps to advance\nthe debate. Of course, Roskies might (following Prinz (2015), see\nbelow) maintain that internalism is in fact a psychological rather\nthan a conceptual thesis, in which case these criticisms of the\nconceptual coherence of treating cases of VM patients as cases of\namoralism would no longer apply.\n\nWhether or not Roskies\u2019 (2006 and 2007) replies to many of these\nobjections are successful, there are reasons to doubt that the data\nRoskies cites is sufficient to undermine internalism. Roskies herself\nacknowledges that some versions of internalism (though ones she\nconsiders problematic or as yet insufficiently developed) may be\nconsistent with the data on VM patients.(2003: 62\u201363) Schroeder\net al. (2010: 95) note that research suggests that psychopaths have a\n\u201cdiminished capacity to distinguish moral from conventional\nviolations,\u201d which has led some to conclude that they have\n\u201cimpaired moral concepts\u201d (2010: 96, citing Nichols 2004).\nIf they do have impaired moral concepts, then they pose no problem for\nthe internalist. In the case of VM patients, however, they note that\nit has \u201cbeen argued that people exhibiting acquired sociopathy\ndo not exhibit moral deficits at all, but that their deficits in\nnon-moral aspects of life merely manifest occasionally in moral\nsituations.\u201d Further studies, they indicate, will be needed to\nresolve the question of whether VM patients pose a threat to what\nSchroeder et al. call cognitivism and Roskies calls motive-internalism\n(2010: 97). In any case, it is disputed how best to explain the extant\ndata on VM patients. VM patients who suffer injury early in life\nexhibit sociopathic behavior, including violent behavior, whereas VM\npatients who acquire their injuries later in life do not. In dispute\nis whether the latter patients are not violent, for example, because\ntheir moral judgments are to some degree motivating or whether their\nnonviolent behavior is a function of habit (98). Finally, as Roskies\n(2007: 205) carefully explains, \u201cthe evidence is inconclusive\nbecause the best-designed tests of the cognition and behavior of VM\npatients have not yet been done\u201d. \n\nPrinz (2015) has argued, in contrast to Roskies, that empirical\nevidence supports internalism. He argues first that \u201cinternalism\ncan be understood as a psychological thesis\u201d (61), rather than a\nconceptual or a priori truth, and then offers several empirical\narguments in support of it. The first appeals to a view called\n\u201csentimentalism\u201d. \n\nMoral judgments consist of emotional attitudes.\nEmotional attitudes are motivating.\nTherefore, moral judgments are motivating. (70)\n\n\nThe controversial step in the argument is the first premise. Prinz\nsays that premise 1 is a statement of sentimentalism, the view that\n\u201cmoral judgments consist of feelings directed at whatever it is\nthat we moralize\u201d (70). He argues that the thesis supports\nvarious empirical predictions, which studies bear out. First,\nneuroimaging studies on moral cognition provide evidence that\n\u201cpeople enter emotional states when they make moral\njudgments\u201d (71). Second, studies show that induced emotions have\nan impact on moral judgment, and \u201cdifferent emotions have\ndifferent effects\u201d (72). For example, inducing disgust leads\npeople to judge a scenario involving moral wrongness more harshly.\nInduced happiness increases positive moral judgments but not negative,\nwhereas anger increases negative moral judgments but not positive\nmoral judgments (72). Finally, people with differing emotional\ndispositions differ in moral judgments. For example,\n\u201cpsychopaths, who have deficits in several negative emotions,\nbut not disgust, show insensitivity to crimes against persons, but are\nnot known for sexual deviancy\u201d (73), whereas those with\nHuntington\u2019s disease have deficits in disgust, and exhibit\npatterns of sexual deviancy (72). These findings, Prinz contends,\n\u201cadd support to the claim that emotions are components of moral\njudgments. Emotions occur when people make moral judgments, they are\nused as information when reporting strength of moral attitudes, and\nemotional deficits lead to corresponding deficits in moral\nsensitivity\u201d (73). According to Prinz, given this evidence, and\ngiven decades of research that links emotion to behavior, thereby\nsupporting premise 2, this argument provides strong support for\ninternalism.\n\nWhat the sentimentalist\u2019s claim comes to is far less clear than\nPrinz allows. Sometimes he says that moral judgments \u201cconsist\nof\u201d emotional attitudes, sometimes that they are\n\u201ccomponents\u201d of moral judgments. It isn\u2019t clear,\nhowever, that the evidence provides adequate support for\nsentimentalism, as opposed to the view that emotions (contingently)\naccompany moral judgment. That emotions would accompany moral judgment\nis unsurprising, given the importance of morality to human welfare.\n\n\nPrinz offers four additional arguments, only two of which are\nconsidered briefly here. The first argues from experimental evidence\nthat seems to show that people ordinarily \u201cregard emotions as\nnecessary for having moral attitudes\u201d (75). For example,\nsubjects in one study were asked to assess the moral attitudes of two\nindividuals. Person A smokes marijuana, feels no guilt for doing so,\ndoes not have negative attitudes toward others who do, but\nnevertheless says that he thinks smoking marijuana is morally wrong.\nPerson B smokes marijuana, feels guilt for doing so, has negative\nfeelings toward those who do, but nevertheless says she thinks that\nsmoking marijuana is not morally wrong. The majority of respondents\nconcluded that the first smoker does not really think smoking\nmarijuana is morally wrong, whereas the second really does think it is\nmorally wrong, despite his claims to the contrary. Prinz says that\n\u201cthe majority treat emotions as necessary and sufficient for\nmoral attribution,\u201d which suggests that \u201cthe ordinary folk\nare committed to a kind of sentimentalism.\u201d This at most would\nshow us what ordinary folks think, though; it would not support\nsentimentalism as a metaphysical thesis \u201cthat it is part of the\nessence of moral judgments that they can be motivating\u201d (64).\nPrinz speculates that more research might \u201cestablish a more\nconsistent conceptual link between emotions and moral judgments\u201d\n(76). At present, though, the studies Prinz cites are insufficient to\nlend much support to internalism.\n\nThe second of Prinz\u2019s other arguments appeals to studies showing\nthat people are sometimes motivated to act morally, even when it would\nbe instrumentally rational not to. He suggests that the\n\u201csimplest explanation is that moral judgments have motivational\nforce, independent of nonmoral motivation\u201d (77). But\nexternalists are at least as well-positioned to explain the evidence\nby appealing to acculturation and common desires to help others or to\ndo the right thing. \n\nEmpirical research on moral motivation is, of course, of great\ninterest in its own right. But many would doubt the relevance of such\nresearch to what internalists take to be a conceptual claim, a claim\nabout a necessary connection between moral judgment and moral\nmotivation. Even supposing that empirical research could help to\nresolve the impasse between internalists and externalists, the extant\nresearch is far from doing so.\n",
