    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions about the\nnature and value of music and our experience of it. Like any\n\u201cphilosophy of X,\u201d it presupposes knowledge of its target.\nHowever, unlike philosophy of science, say, the target of philosophy\nof music is a practice most people have a significant background in,\nmerely as a result of being members of a musical culture. Many people\ntake music to play a significant and valuable role in their lives.\nThus, as with the central questions of metaphysics, epistemology, and\nethics, not only can most people quickly grasp the philosophical\nquestions music raises, they tend to have thought about some of those\nquestions before encountering the academic discipline itself.\n\nMusic arguably presents more philosophical puzzles than any other art.\nUnlike painting, its works often have multiple instances, none of\nwhich can be identified with the work itself. Thus, the question of\nwhat exactly the work is is initially more puzzling than the\nsame question about works of painting, which appear (at least\ninitially) to be ordinary physical objects. Unlike much literature,\nthe instances of a work are performances, which offer interpretations\nof the work, yet the work can also be interpreted (perhaps in a\ndifferent sense) independent of any performance, and performances\nthemselves can be interpreted. This talk of\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d points to the fact that we find music an\nart steeped with meaning, and yet, unlike drama, music\u2014at least\n\u201cpure\u201d instrumental music\u2014has no obvious semantic\ncontent. This quickly raises the question of why we should find music\nso valuable. Central to many philosophers\u2019 thinking on these\nsubjects has been music\u2019s apparent ability to express emotions\nwhile remaining an abstract art in some sense.\n\nThis entry focuses almost exclusively on contemporary philosophy of\nmusic (i.e., work since the mid-twentieth century) in an analytic\nvein. For a historical overview, see the entries on the\n history of Western philosophy of music: antiquity to 1800\n and\n history of Western philosophy of music: since 1800.\n For much broader introductions to philosophy of music, covering its\nhistory, major figures, connections with other disciplines, and a\nwider range of topics, see Gracyk & Kania 2011 and McAuley,\nNielsen, & Levinson 2021. Useful single-author overviews include\nScruton 1997, Kivy 2002, Hamilton 2007, and Kania 2020.\n\nMost analytic work has primarily discussed Western classical music.\n(For criticism of this tendency, see Alperson 2009.) In the last 25\nyears, there has been increasing recognition that different musical\npractices may not only suggest different answers to the same\nphilosophical questions, but also raise different philosophical\nquestions. Apart from Western classical music, popular Western\ntraditions, such as rock and jazz, have received the most attention.\nNon-Western musical traditions have received little attention.\n(Exceptions include S. Davies 2001: 254\u201394 and 2007; Alperson,\nNguyen, & To 2007; S. P. Walton 2007; and Higgins 2007.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What Is Music?\n1.1 Music Alone and Together\n\nIt is plausible that song is the most common kind of music listened to\nacross history and the globe. Moving images (film, television,\nvideogames, etc.) are ubiquitous in the contemporary world, and most\nhave musical soundtracks. Nonetheless, most philosophy of music\nconsiders what Peter Kivy calls music alone\n(1990)\u2014instrumental music with no non-musical aspects, elements,\nor accompaniments. At least three reasons can be given to defend this\nnarrow focus. First, pure music often presents the most difficult\nphilosophical problems. The maudlin text of a song plausibly\ncontributes to the song\u2019s expressiveness; it is more puzzling\nhow a piece of music alone could be emotionally expressive. Second,\nthough the problems are more difficult, the solutions are likely to be\nmore easily evaluated with respect to music alone. Just as\napportioning blame is easier when one person is responsible for a\ncrime than when the blame must be divided between a number of\nconspirators, the success of a solution to the problem of musical\nexpressiveness may be clearer if it can explain the expressiveness of\nmusic alone. Third, the expressiveness of music alone will play a role\nin the expressiveness of musical hybrids such as song or film.\nThough its text may contribute to the expressiveness of a song, for\ninstance, the musical aspects of the song must play some\nrole. A maudlin text set to a jauntily upbeat melody will clearly not\nhave the same overall expressiveness as the same text set to a\nplodding dirge. Though expressiveness is used as an example here,\nthese same points apply to discussions of musical understanding and\nvalue.\n\nEven if these three reasons are compelling (see Ridley 2004 for a\nsustained critique), music\u2019s combination with other media raises\nfurther philosophical questions. There is no space to consider those\nquestions here, but on the aesthetics of song, see Levinson 1987;\nGracyk 2001; Bicknell & Fisher 2013; and Bicknell 2015. On music\ndrama, see Kivy 1988b, 1994; Goehr 1998; and Penner 2020. On film\nmusic, see Carroll 1988: 213\u2013225; Smith 1996; Levinson 1996b;\nand Kivy 1997a. See also the chapters in part V of Gracyk & Kania\n2011. On hybrid art forms more generally, see Levinson 1984 and Ridley\n2004.\n1.2 The Definition of \u201cMusic\u201d\n\nExplications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that\nmusic is organized sound. They go on to note that this\ncharacterization is too broad, since there are many examples of\norganized sound that are not music, such as human speech, or the\nsounds non-human animals and machines make. There are two further\nkinds of necessary conditions philosophers have added in attempts to\nfine tune the initial idea. One is an appeal to \u201ctonality\u201d\nor essentially musical features such as pitch and rhythm (Scruton\n1997: 1\u201379; Hamilton 2007: 40\u201365; Kania 2011a). Another is\nan appeal to aesthetic properties or experience (Levinson 1990a;\nScruton 1997: 1\u201396; Hamilton 2007: 40\u201365). As these\nreferences suggest, one can endorse either of these conditions in\nisolation, or both together.\n\nThe main problem with the first kind of condition is that every sound\nseems capable of being included in a musical performance, and thus\ncharacterizing the essentially musical features of sounds seems\nhopeless. (We need only consider the variety of \u201cuntuned\u201d\npercussion available to a conservative symphonist, though we could\nalso consider examples of wind machines, typewriters, and toilets, in\nRalph Vaughan Williams\u2019s Sinfonia Antartica, Leroy\nAnderson\u2019s The Typewriter, and Yoko Ono\u2019s\n\u201cToilet Piece/Unknown.\u201d) Defenders of such a condition\nhave turned to sophisticated intentional or response-dependent\ntheories of tonality in order to overcome this problem. If the\nessentially musical features of a sound are not intrinsic to it, but\nsomehow related to how it is produced or perceived, we can classify\njust one of two \u201cindiscernible\u201d sounds as music.\n\nIf one endorses only an aesthetic condition, and not a tonality\ncondition, one still faces the problem of poetry\u2014non-musical\naesthetically organized sounds. Levinson, who takes this approach,\nexcludes organized linguistic sounds explicitly (1990a: 272). This\nraises the question of whether there are further distinctions to be\nmade between arts of sound. Andy Hamilton defends a tripartite\ndivision, arguing that sound art, as opposed to both music\nand literature, was established as a significant art form in the\ntwentieth century (2007: 40\u201365). This is one reason that\nHamilton endorses both tonal and aesthetic conditions on music;\nwithout the former, Levinson is unable to make such a distinction. On\nthe other hand, by endorsing an aesthetic condition, Hamilton is\nforced to exclude scales and Muzak, for instance, from the realm of\nmusic. Kania (2020: 296\u2013301) suggests that it is a mistake to\nthink that music is necessarily an art. He argues that we should\ndistinguish the medium of music from its artistic uses, just\nas we do in the cases of language and literature, depiction and\npainting, and so on.\n\nJonathan McKeown-Green (2014) makes trenchant criticisms of\ndefinitions of music that assume that the nature of music is\nsettled by our conception of music (395, italics removed). He\nargues that no such definition could be future-proof, since it\nwould be hostage to our changing conception of music. At best, we\nwould end up with a kind of sociological history of music that would\nfail to fulfill any of the functions of a definition. McKeown-Green\nsingles out the definitions of Kania (2011a) and Levinson (1990a),\nstated in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, as of this\nhopeless kind. But Kania (2020: 302\u20135) argues that\nMcKeown-Green\u2019s criticisms apply equally to the looser\ndefinitions of Hamilton and S. Davies (2012).\n\nHaving discussed complications, it\u2019s worth returning to the\nbasic idea of \u201corganized sound.\u201d Most theorists note that\nmusic does not consist entirely of sounds. Most obviously, much music\nincludes rests. You might think that silence can function only to\norganize the sounds of music. One counterargument is that an\nunderstanding listener listens to the rests, just as she\nlistens to the sounds (Kania 2010). Another is to provide putative\ncases of music in which the silences do not structure sounds as\nordinary rests do. John Cage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033 is\nfrequently discussed, though there is broad agreement that this piece\nis not silent\u2014its content is the ambient sounds that occur\nduring its performance. (See Dodd 2018 for dissent.) Anyway, S. Davies\n(1997a), Dodd (2018), and Kania (2010) all argue that Cage\u2019s\npiece is not music\u2014Davies and Dodd because its sounds (if any)\nfail to qualify as organized, Kania because they fail to meet a\ntonality condition. Wadle (forthcoming) argues that the piece\nis music, because of its contextual connections to previous\nmusical works. Kania considers several other contenders for the label\nof \u201csilent music,\u201d arguing that there are indeed extant\nexamples, most notably Erwin Schulhoff\u2019s \u201cIn\nFuturum\u201d from his F\u00fcnf Pittoresken, which predates\nCage\u2019s 4\u203233\u2033 by some 33 years.\n2. Musical Ontology\n\nMusical ontology is the study of the kinds of musical things there are\nand the relations that hold between them. The most discussed issues\nwithin this field have been the metaphysical nature of works of\nWestern classical music (the \u201cfundamentalist debate\u201d), and\nwhat it is to give an \u201cauthentic performance\u201d of such\nworks. Recently there has been growing interest in the ontologies of\nother Western musical traditions, such as rock and jazz, and\ndiscussion of the methodology and value of musical ontology. (For more\ndetailed overviews of these debates, see Matheson & Caplan 2011,\nand Nussbaum 2021.)\n2.1 The Fundamentalist Debate\n\nMusical works in the Western classical tradition admit of multiple\ninstances (performances). Much of the debate over the nature of such\nworks thus reads like a recapitulation of the debate over the\n\u201cproblem of universals\u201d; the range of proposed candidates\ncovers the spectrum of fundamental ontological theories. We might\ndivide musical ontologists into the realists, who posit the existence\nof musical works, and the anti-realists, who deny their existence.\nRealism has been more popular than anti-realism, but there have been\nmany conflicting realist views. We begin with two unorthodox realist\nviews before moving on to more orthodox Platonist and nominalist\ntheories, concluding with a consideration of anti-realism.\n\nIdealists hold that musical works are mental entities. Collingwood\n(1938) and Sartre (1940) respectively take musical (and other) works\nto be imaginary objects and experiences. The most serious objections\nto this kind of view are that (i) it fails to make works\nintersubjectively accessible, since the number of works going under\nthe name The Rite of Spring will be as multifarious as the\nimaginative experiences people have at performances with that name,\nand (ii) it makes the medium of the work irrelevant to an\nunderstanding of it. One might have the same imaginative experience in\nresponse to both a live performance and a recording of The Rite of\nSpring, yet it seems an open question whether the two media are\naesthetically equivalent. But see Cox 1986 and Cray & Matheson\n2017 for attempts to revive idealism.\n\nDavid Davies argues that musical works, like all works of art, are\nactions, in particular the compositional actions of their\ncomposers (2004). Thus he revives what we might call an \u201caction\ntheory\u201d of the ontology of art. (An earlier defender of such a\nview is Gregory Currie (1989), who argues that artworks are\ntypes of action, rather than the particular actions\nwith which Davies identifies them.) Although deciding between theories\nof musical ontology is always to some extent a matter of finding a\nbalance between the benefits of a theory and its cost in terms of our\npre-theoretic intuitions, action theories have a particularly hard row\nto hoe since they imply that an instance of a work is some action\nperformed by a composer, rather than a performance. In order to make\nup for such damage to our intuitions the theoretical benefits of an\naction theory would have to be quite extensive.\n\nMost theorists think that some kind of Platonist or nominalist theory\nof musical works is more plausible than those so far considered.\nPlatonism, the view that musical works are abstract objects, is\narguably still the dominant view, though it seems to be losing ground\nto sophisticated nominalisms. Its great advantage is its ability to\nrespect more of our pre-theoretic intuitions about musical works than\nother theories can. On the other hand, it is the most ontologically\npuzzling, since abstract objects are not well understood. Nonetheless,\nPlatonism has been tenacious, with much of the debate centering around\nwhat variety of abstract object musical works are. What we might call\n\u201csimple Platonism\u201d (known simply as\n\u201cPlatonism\u201d in the literature), is the view that works are\neternal existents, existing in neither space nor time (Kivy 1983a,\n1983b, Dodd 2007). Puy (2019) presents a variation according to which\nmusical works are higher-order types, of which the types other\nPlatonist thinks are works are specific versions of works.\n(See D. Davies 2021 for discussion.)\n\nAccording to \u201ccomplex Platonism,\u201d musical works come to\nexist in time as the result of human action. The complexity is\nmotivated by a number of features of musical practice, including the\nintuition that musical works are creatable, the attribution of various\naesthetic and artistic properties to works, and the fine-grained\nindividuation of works and performances (e.g., in terms of who\ncomposed them, or what instruments they are properly performed upon)\n(Ingarden 1961; Thomasson 2004; Wolterstorff 1980; Wollheim 1968:\n1\u201310, 74\u201384; Levinson 1980, 1990b, 2012; S. Davies 2001:\n37\u201343; Howell 2002; Stecker 2003a: 84\u201392).\n\nNominalists identify a musical work with something concrete. The most\nobvious candidate is a collection of performances, whether the\ncollection be understood as a set (Goodman 1968; Predelli 1995, 1999a,\n1999b, 2001), a fusion (Caplan & Matheson 2004, 2006), or\nsomething more esoteric (Tillman 2011; see also Moruzzi 2018). Charles\nNussbaum (2007: 143\u201387) and P. D. Magnus (2012) argue for a\nclose analogy between musical works and species. Nussbaum (2021: 334)\npoints out that a sophisticated nominalist theory of species has been\ndeveloped in great detail over the years by Ruth Millikan (1984,\n2000). While such views are attractive because they appeal only to the\nleast problematic kinds of entities, they face serious challenges.\nThough many of our claims about musical works may be paraphraseable\ninto claims about sets of (possible) performances, some seem to make\nintractable reference to works. For instance, most performances of The\nRite of Spring\u2014even including the possible ones\u2014include\nseveral wrong notes. Thus it is difficult to imagine how the\nparaphrase schema will avoid the nonsensical conclusion that The Rite\nof Spring contains several wrong notes, if the work consists entirely\nof performances. In response to this problem, most nominalists add to\nthe collection of performances some provenential item, such as an\noriginal score or act of composition. Whether this addition can solve\nthe problem without necessitating the reintroduction of an abstract\nentity is one question any nominalist must address.\n\nIntermediate between Platonism and nominalism are the views of Philip\nLetts (2018) and Guy Rohrbaugh (2003). Letts argues that any view of\nmusical works as types would be improved by identifying those\ntypes with their associated properties, a proposal that may be\ndeveloped in a Platonist or nominalist direction. Rohrbaugh\u2019s\nview of musical works as historical individuals\n\u201cembodied in,\u201d but not constituted by, physical things\nsuch as scores and performances closely resembles to the views of\nNussbaum and Magnus, discussed above, but Rohrbaugh takes the work to\nbe an abstract object over and above its embodiments. (For discussion,\nsee Dodd 2007: 143\u201366.)\n\nIn contrast to all these realist views stand those of the\nanti-realists, who deny that there are any such things as musical\nworks. An early proponent of such a view is Richard Rudner (1950),\nthough it is difficult to say whether he is best interpreted as an\neliminativist or a fictionalist, the two anti-realist views currently\non the table. According to eliminativists, there are no such things as\nmusical works, and thus we ought to stop trying to refer to them. Ross\nCameron (2008) defends such a view, but only with respect to\n\u201cOntologese\u201d\u2014the language we speak when we do\nontology. He argues that ordinary English locutions such as\n\u201cthere are many musical works\u201d can be true without there\nbeing any musical works. (For critical discussion, see Predelli 2009\nand Stecker 2009.) According to fictionalists, the value of discourse\nabout musical works is not truth, and thus we ought not to abandon the\ndiscourse despite the non-existence of its subject matter, but rather\nto adopt a different, make-believe attitude towards it (or perhaps we\nalready do so). (See Kania 2008; for criticism, see D. Davies 2011:\n45\u201350, Letts 2015, and Nussbaum 2021: 337.)\n\nMuch of this debate over the fundamental ontological category to which\nmusical works belong has turned on \u201ctechnical\u201d issues,\nthat is, controversial general metaphysical claims about the nature of\nproperties, causation, embodiment, and so on (e.g., Howell 2002;\nTrivedi 2002; Caplan & Matheson 2004, 2006; Dodd 2007; Hazlett\n2012; Kleinschmidt & Ross 2012; Dodd & Letts 2017; Cameron\n2008). In the face of this, some theorists have pointed out that\nmusical works are cultural entities, and thus the methodology\nappropriate to uncovering their ontological status might be quite\ndifferent from that of general metaphysics (Goehr 1992; S. Davies\n2003a; D. Davies 2004; Thomasson 2006). For further discussion of the\nmethodology of musical ontology, see D. Davies 2009, 2017; Predelli\n2009; Stecker 2009; Dodd 2010, 2013; Mag Uidhir 2012b; and Nussbaum\n2021.\n2.2 Higher-level Ontological Issues\n\nIt might seem that, since musical works are ontologically multiple,\nonce we have figured out their true nature, we will know what relation\nholds between the work and its performances, namely, whatever\nrelationship holds between entities of that kind and their instances.\nHowever, since the fundamentalist debate is about the basic\nontological category to which works belong, resolving that debate may\nleave open many questions about the relation between a work and its\nperformances. For instance, is the use of a harpsichord required to\ninstance Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in\nperformance? Would producing harpsichord-like sounds on a synthesizer\ndo just as well? What about using another keyboard instrument from\nBach\u2019s time, or a modern piano? Learning that musical works are,\nsay, eternal types will not necessarily help settle this issue of\n\u201cauthentic performance,\u201d which is perhaps the most\ndiscussed music-ontological issue, of interest to philosophers,\nmusicologists, musicians, and audiences alike. (For an excellent\noverview of the authentic performance debate, see S. Davies 2001:\n201\u201353. For an investigation of authenticity with respect to\nthings other than instantiation of the work, see Kivy 1995; Gracyk\n2001, 2009, 2017; Bicknell 2015; and Cray 2019.)\n\nThere have been two sources of widespread confusion in the debate over\nauthenticity in performance. One is a failure to recognize that\nauthenticity is not simply a property, but a relation that comes in\ndegrees and holds with respect to different aspects of its target.\nSomething may be more authentic in one regard and less authentic in\nanother (S. Davies 2001: 203\u20135). Another is the assumption that\nauthenticity is an evaluative concept, in the sense that\n\u201cauthentic\u201d implies \u201cgood.\u201d That this is not\nthe case is clear from the fact that an authentic murderer is not a\ngood thing (S. Davies 2001: 204). Thus, our value judgments will be\ncomplex functions of the extent to which we judge performances\nauthentic in various regards, and the values we assign to those\nvarious kinds of authenticity.\n\nThe central kind of authenticity that has been discussed is\nauthenticity with respect to the instantiation of the work. Most agree\nthat the fullest such authenticity requires the production of the\nright pitches and rhythms in the right order. (For skepticism based on\nthe history of the practice, see Dyck 2014; Ravasio 2019a; and the\ndiscussion in Dodd 2020b and Ravasio 2020.) Pure sonicists\nargue that this is sufficient (e.g., Kivy 1988a). Timbral\nsonicists argue that these pitches must also have timbres\nreflecting the composer\u2019s instrumentation (e.g., Dodd 2007:\n201\u201339). Instrumentalists argue that such sounds must\nbe produced on the kinds of instruments specified in the score (e.g.,\nLevinson 1990c). Much of the debate is over what kinds of aesthetic or\nartistic properties are essential to musical works. If the limpid\ntextures of Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 are\nessential to it, then one cannot authentically instance the work using\na grand piano instead of a harpsichord. As such, the debate reflects a\nwider one in aesthetics, musical and otherwise, between\nformalists (or empiricists, or structuralists), who believe\nthat the most important properties of a work are intrinsic ones,\naccessible to listeners unaware of the historical and artistic context\nin which it was created, and contextualists, who believe that\na work is essentially tied to its context of creation. Stephen Davies\nhas argued for a strong contextualism, claiming that one cannot give a\nsingle answer to the question of whether particular instrumentation is\nrequired for the fully authentic instantiation of a work. Works can be\nontologically \u201cthicker\u201d or \u201cthinner\u201d as a\nresult of the specifications of a composer working within certain\nconventions (1991, 2001). The more properties of a fully authentic\nperformance a particular work specifies, the thicker it is. Thus for\nsome works (typically earlier in the history of Western music)\ninstrumentation is flexible, while for others (e.g., Romantic\nsymphonies) quite specific instrumentation is required for fully\nauthentic performances.\n\nIn addition to the question of what constitutes authenticity, there\nhas been debate over its attainability and value. Those who question\nits attainability point to our historical distance from the creation\nof some works (Young 1988). We may no longer be able to read the\nnotation in which the work is recorded, or construct or play the\ninstruments for which it was written. If so, full authenticity is not\nattainable. But we rarely have no idea about these matters, and thus\nwe might achieve partial authenticity (S. Davies 2001: 228\u201334).\nThose who question the value of authenticity often target kinds other\nthan work-instantiation. For instance, one might question the value of\nproducing a performance that authentically captures the sound of\nperformances as they took place in the context of a work\u2019s\ncomposition, on the basis that musicians were not as highly skilled\nthen as now, for instance (Young 1988: 229\u201331). Such arguments,\nthough, have no consequences for the value of work-instantiation. Some\nargue that although we might attain an authentic instance of a work,\nthe idea that we might thereby hear the work as its contemporaries\nheard it is wishful thinking, since the musical culture in which we\nare immersed enforces ways of listening upon us that we cannot escape\n(Young 1988: 232\u20137). Thus the point of such authenticity is\nquestioned. In response, we may consider not only the possibility that\nwe are in a better position to appreciate historical works than\ncontemporary ones, but also the remarkable flexibility people seem to\nshow in enjoying many different kinds of music from throughout history\nand the world (S. Davies 2001: 234\u20137).\n\nJulian Dodd (2020a) argues that there is more than one way to be true\nto a musical work, and thus to produce an authentic performance: One\ncan comply with the score, or one can be true to the music\u2019s\noverall integrity or point (136). When the two conflict,\ninterpretive authenticity trumps score-compliance authenticity\n(147) because the fundamental norm of work-performance practice is to\nperform it in a way that evinces a subtle or profound understanding\nof it (163), while score compliance is valued only because it\ntends to lead to such performances. Andrew Kania responds that it is\nunclear whether, even by the lights of Dodd\u2019s own theory,\nDodd\u2019s central examples are cases of interpretive authenticity\ntrumping score compliance (Kania 2022: 131\u20132). More importantly,\nhe argues that Dodd\u2019s conception of the music\u2019s overall\nintegrity or point misses the importance of the surface-level\ndetails to a work\u2019s meaning or content. Kania suggests, instead,\nthat the fundamental norm of the practice is to evince an\nunderstanding of the work through complying with its\nscore (2022: 127, italics altered).\n\nMoving on from authenticity, a second area that may be independent of\nthe fundamentalist debate is that of comparative ontology. (For\ndispute over this framing issue, see Brown 2011, 2012.) Just as\nclassical works from different historical periods may be ontologically\ndiverse, so may works from different contemporary traditions. Theodore\nGracyk has argued that instances of works of rock music are not\nperformances. Rather, the work is instanced by playing a copy of a\nrecording on an appropriate device (1996; cf. Fisher 1998). Stephen\nDavies has argued that rock is more like classical music than Gracyk\nacknowledges, with works for performance at the heart of the\ntradition, albeit works for a different kind of performance (2001:\n30\u20136). Gracyk\u2019s view has been amplified and defended in\nattempts to find a place for composition, live performance, and\nperformance skill within his basic framework (Kania 2006, Bruno 2013,\nBartel 2017, Magnus 2022).\n\nWork on the ontology of jazz has centered on the nature of\nimprovisation, particularly the relation between improvisation and\ncomposition (Alperson 1984, 1998; Valone 1985; Brown 1996, 2000;\nHagberg 1998; Gould & Keaton 2000; Sterritt 2000; and Young &\nMatheson 2000; Bresnahan 2015; Love 2016; Magnus 2016). This has been\na useful reminder that not all music is the performance of\npre-composed works (Wolterstorff 1987: 115\u201329). However,\nimprovisation can occur within the context of such a work, as in the\nperformance of an improvised cadenza in a classical concerto. Some\nhave argued that there is not as significant a distinction between\nimprovisation and composition as is usually thought (Alperson 1984).\nOthers have argued that all performance requires improvisation (Gould\n& Keaton 2000). Yet others restrict the possibility of\nimprovisation to certain kinds of musical properties, such as\n\u201cstructural\u201d rather than \u201cexpressive\u201d ones\n(Young & Matheson 2000). However, none of these arguments are\ncompelling. Usually they turn on equivocal use of terms such as\n\u201ccomposition\u201d and \u201cperformance,\u201d or beg the\nquestion by defining improvisation in terms of deviation from a score\nor variation of a limited set of \u201cexpressive\u201d\nproperties.\n\nThough jazz is not necessarily improvisational, and very few jazz\nperformances lack any sort of prior compositional process, the\ncentrality of improvisation to jazz presents a challenge to the\nmusical ontologist. One might argue that jazz works are ontologically\nlike classical works\u2014composed for multiple, different\nperformances\u2014but that they tend to be thinner, leaving more room\nfor improvisation (Gould & Keaton 2000; Young & Matheson\n2000). The difficulty is to specify the work without conflating one\nwork with another, since tokening the melody may not be required, and\nmany works share the same harmonic structure. As a result, some argue\nthat the performance is itself the work (Alperson 1984; Hagberg 2002;\nS. Davies 2001: 16\u201319). One problem here is parity with\nclassical music. If jazz performances are musical works in their own\nright, it is difficult to deny that status to classical performances\nof works, yet this seems to multiply works beyond what we usually\nthink is necessary. A third possibility is that in jazz there are no\nworks, only performances (Brown 1996, 2000: 115; Kania 2011b). This is\ncounterintuitive if \u201cwork\u201d is an evaluative term, but it\nis not obvious that this is the case.\n\nJulian Dodd (2014a) argues that the kinds of considerations adduced in\nfavor of these views confuse questions of ontology with questions of\nvalue. Jazz is ontologically like early classical music, according to\nDodd: the focus of critical attention is the improvisatory performance\nrather than the composition it instantiates, but that composition is\nno less a musical work for that difference in critical emphasis. (See\nFisher 2018 for an attempted reconciliation.) Similar considerations\nmight be adduced against the increasingly complicated ontologies of\nrock referred to above. Such arguments return us to debates about the\nmethodology of musical ontology.\n3. Music and the Emotions\n\nThe most widely discussed philosophical question concerning music and\nthe emotions is that of how music can express emotions. (For a more\nextensive introduction, see part II of Gracyk & Kania 2011; for a\nthorough treatment, see S. Davies 1994.) There is a second group of\nquestions centered around listeners\u2019 emotional responses to\nmusic. These include questions about why and how we respond\nemotionally to music, the value of such responses, and why we choose\nto listen to music that elicits \u201cnegative\u201d responses from\nus, such as sadness. Theorists typically restrict themselves to\n\u201cpure\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d music on the grounds that\nit is easier to understand how music with an accompanying text, say,\ncould express the emotions evident in the text. However, an important\ncriterion for the evaluation of such music is how appropriately the\ncomposer has set her chosen text to music. So an accompanying text is\nclearly not sufficient for the musical expression of an emotion. Thus,\na better reason for initially putting such music to one side is\nperhaps that the interrelation of music and text, or other elements,\nis likely to be highly complex, and best approached with as\nwell-developed a theory of the more basic phenomena in hand as\npossible. (For an extended criticism of this approach, see Ridley\n2004: 1\u2013104.)\n3.1 Emotions in the Music\n\nPieces of music, and performances of them, are standardly said to be\nhappy, sad, and so on. Music\u2019s emotional expressiveness is a\nphilosophical problem since the paradigm expressers of emotions are\npsychological agents, who have emotions to express. Neither pieces of\nmusic, nor performances of them, are psychological agents, thus it is\npuzzling that such things could be said to express emotions.\n\nOne radical way to solve the puzzle is to deny that music is\nemotionally expressive. A major burden of such eliminativism is\nto explain away the widespread tendency to describe music in emotional\nterms. This has been attempted by arguing that such descriptions are\nshorthand or metaphor for purely sonic features (Urmson 1973), basic\ndynamic features (Hanslick 1854), purely musical features (Sharpe\n1982), or aesthetic properties (Zangwill 2007). There are many\nproblems with such views. For one thing, they seem committed to some\nsort of scheme for reduction of expressive predicates to other terms,\nsuch as sonic or musical ones, and such a scheme is difficult to\nimagine (Budd 1985a: 31\u20136). For another, anyone not drawn to\nthis theory is likely to reject the claim that the paraphrase captures\nall that is of interest and value about the passage described,\nprecisely because it omits the expressive predicates (Davies 1994:\n153\u20134).\n\nConventionalism is the view that music\u2019s expressiveness\nis a matter of the conventional association of certain musical\nelements, such as slow tempi, with certain emotional states, such as\nsadness. Such conventions must play a role in some cases of\nexpression\u2014for instance, cases of particular musical instruments\n(e.g., the snare drum) being associated with particular situations\n(e.g., war) and thus emotions (e.g., foreboding). But such conventions\nseem unlikely to account for all musical expressiveness, since much of\nthat expressiveness seems less arbitrary than conventionalism would\nsuggest. It seems implausible, for instance, that the convention for\nfuneral dirges might just as easily have that they should be\nquick-paced and in major keys. Even in cases like the snare drum, it\nseems possible that the instrument was chosen for the battlefield in\npart because of the expressive character of its sonic profile.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 that music is \u201cthe language of the\nemotions\u201d is often considered as a possible starting point for a\ntheory of musical expressiveness. The idea combines the attractive\nsimplicity of conventionalism with the formalist notion that\nmusic\u2019s order is to be understood in terms of syntax. (See\nLerdahl & Jackendoff 1983 for a theory along the latter lines.)\nHowever, although Deryck Cooke (1959) and Leonard Meyer (1956) are\noften cited as proponents, it is not clear that anyone holds a\nfull-blown version of the theory. The central problem is the great\ndisparities between language and music, in terms of the ways in which\neach is both syntactic and semantic (Jackendoff 2011). A serious\nsubsidiary problem is that even if music were about the\nemotions in the way that language can be, that would not account for\nmusic\u2019s expressiveness. The sentence \u201cI am\nsad\u201d is about the emotions, but it is not expressive of\nsadness in the way a sad face is, though you could use either to\nexpress your sadness. Most people agree that music\u2019s relation to\nemotion is more like that of a sad face than that of a sentence. (This\nlast criticism is also applicable to Susanne Langer\u2019s theory\n(1953) that music is about the emotions in a symbolic yet\nnon-linguistic way.)\n\nWe now turn to theories that attempt to connect the notion of\nmusic\u2019s expressiveness to actual felt emotions. One obvious way\nto do so is to argue that pieces of music or performances of them are\nexpressions of such emotions\u2014those of the composer or performer.\nThere are two major problems with this \u201cexpression\ntheory.\u201d The first is that neither composers nor performers\noften experience the emotions their music is expressive of as it is\nproduced. Nor does it seem unlikely that a composer could create, or a\nperformer perform, a piece expressive of an emotion that she had never\nexperienced. This is not to deny that a composer could write a piece\nexpressive of her emotional state, but for the expression theory to be\nan account of musical expressiveness, at least all central cases of\nexpressiveness must follow this model, which is not the case.\nMoreover, if a composer is to express her sadness, say, by writing a\nsad piece, she must pen the right kind of piece. In other words, if\nshe is a bad composer she might fail to express her emotion. This\nbrings us to the second major problem for the expression theory. If a\ncomposer can fail to express her emotions in a piece, then the music\nshe writes is expressive independent of the emotion she is\nexperiencing. Thus music\u2019s expressiveness cannot be explained in\nterms of direct expression.\n\nThose usually cited as classic expression theorists include Tolstoy\n(1898), Dewey (1934), and Collingwood (1938). (A classic critique is\nTormey 1971: 97\u2013127.) These theorists have been defended in\nrecent discussions, however, from accusations that they hold the\nsimple view outlined above (Ridley 2003, Robinson 2005: 229\u201357).\nJenefer Robinson has attempted to revive the expression theory, though\nshe defends it as an interesting and valuable use of\nmusic\u2019s expressiveness, rather than an account of expressiveness\nitself (2005: 229\u2013347; 2011).\n\nA second way to link music\u2019s expressiveness with actual felt\nemotions is through the audience. According to arousalism, the\nexpressiveness of a passage of music amounts to its tendency to arouse\nthat emotion in a competent listener. Arousalism faces several\nobjections. First, some competent listeners seem emotionally unmoved\nby music (or are at least not moved to the specific emotions expressed\nby it). But perhaps the arousalist can simply restrict the class of\nlistener to which his theory appeals to those who are so moved.\nSecond, some emotions, such as fear, require a particular kind of\nintentional object (something threatening), yet there is no such\nobject at hand when we hear fearful music. Thus it seems implausible\nto claim the music\u2019s fearfulness resides in its arousal of fear\nin us. But perhaps the arousalist can broaden the class of aroused\nemotions to include appropriate responses to the expressed\nemotion, such as pity. Third, in many cases it seems that listeners\nrespond emotionally to the expressiveness of the music. It is not\nclear that the arousalist can handle such cases non-circularly. (A\nsophisticated defense of the arousal theory is to be found in\nMatravers 1998: 145\u2013224, though see the second thoughts in\nMatravers 2011. For an extended critique, see S. Davies 1994:\n104\u2013200.)\n\nDespite the problems of the arousal theory as the whole story of\nmusical expressiveness, there is a growing consensus, thanks largely\nto the work of Jenefer Robinson (1994, 2005), that our lower-level,\nless cognitive responses to music must play some role in the emotional\nexpressiveness we attribute to it. However, this role is likely to be\na causal one, rather than part of an analysis of what it is for music\nto be emotionally expressive.\n\nSeveral theorists have defended accounts of musical expressiveness\nknown variously as resemblance, contour, or\nappearance theories (e.g., Kivy 1989, though see Kivy 2002:\n31\u201348 for recent qualms; Budd 1995: 133\u201354; S. Davies\n1994: 221\u201367). The central idea is that music\u2019s\nexpressiveness consists in the resemblance between its dynamic\ncharacter and that of various typical aspects of people experiencing\nemotions. The aspects appealed to include the phenomenology of the\nexperience of the emotion, the emotion\u2019s facial expression, the\ncontour of vocal expression or bodily behavior of a person\nexperiencing the emotion. Stephen Davies argues that such theories\nhold music to be expressive in a literal albeit secondary sense of the\nterm. We say that a piece of music is sad in the same sense in which\nwe say that a weeping willow is sad (S. Davies 2006: 183). Such uses\nare no more metaphorical than a claim that a chair has arms.\n\nJerrold Levinson agrees that there is an important resemblance between\nthe contour of music expressive of an emotion and the contour of\ntypical behavioral expressions of that emotion. He objects, however,\nthat such an account cannot be the whole, or even the most fundamental\npart of the story (Levinson 1996a, 2006b). He drives in a wedge\nprecisely at the point where an appeal is made to the resemblance\nbetween the music and typical behavioral expressions. He asks what the\nmanner and extent of the resemblance between the two must be,\nprecisely, in order for the music to count as expressive of some\nemotion. After all, everything resembles everything else in all sorts\nof ways, and so one could point out many resemblances between a\nfuneral march and an expression of joy, or for that matter a cup of\ncoffee and sadness. The resemblance theorist must give some account of\nwhy the funeral march, and not the cup of coffee, is expressive of\nsadness and not joy. Levinson claims that the obvious answer here is\nthat the funeral march is \u201creadily hearable as\u201d an\nexpression of sadness. If this is correct, then the resemblance the\nmusic bears to emotional behavior is logically secondary\u2014a cause\nor ground of its expressiveness. The expressiveness itself resides in\nthe music\u2019s disposition to elicit the imaginative response in us\nof hearing the music as a literal expression of emotion. As a logical\nconsequence, the imaginative experience prompted must include some\nagent whose expression the music literally is.\n\nIn reply to this kind of objection, Stephen Davies has emphasized the\nrole of the listener\u2019s response in resemblance theories. Such\nresponses have always been appealed to by such theories, as evidenced\nby Malcolm Budd\u2019s talk of \u201chearing as\u201d (1995:\n135\u20137), and Peter Kivy\u2019s discussion of our tendency to\n\u201canimate\u201d that which we perceive (1980: 57\u20139). But\nDavies now makes the appeal quite explicit and central, devoting as\nmuch space to explication of the response-dependent nature of\nexpressiveness as to the role of resemblance (2006). For Davies, the\nresponse of the competent listener upon which the expressiveness of\nthe music depends is one of an experience of resemblance\nrather than imagined expression (2006: 181\u20132). Matteo Ravasio\n(2019b) argues that this leads to further problems.\n\nSince Davies\u2019s theory posits at base a contour-recognition\nexperience while Levinson\u2019s posits an imaginative experience of\nexpression, the link between literal expression and musical\nexpressiveness looks closer in Levinson\u2019s theory than in\nDavies\u2019s. An empirical consequence seems to be that\nDavies\u2019s theory will predict weaker emotional responses to music\nthan Levinson\u2019s. Whether or not this is an advantage or\ndisadvantage of the theory depends on the empirical facts about how we\nrespond emotionally to music.\n3.2 Emotions in the Listener\n\nThere are three main questions asked about our emotional responses to\npure music, apart from what role they play in expressiveness. The\nfirst is analogous to the \u201cparadox of fiction.\u201d It is not\nclear why we should respond emotionally to music\u2019s\nexpressiveness when we know that no one is undergoing the emotions\nexpressed. The second is a variant of the \u201cparadox of\ntragedy.\u201d If some music arouses \u201cnegative\u201d emotional\nresponses in us, such as sadness, why do we seek out the experience of\nsuch music? This leads to the more general question of the value of\nour emotional responses to music. The first two questions are\naddressed in this section, and the third in section 5.1.\n\nPeter Kivy (1999) argues that those who report emotional reactions to\nmusic are confusing the pleasure they take in the beauty of the music,\nin all its expressive individuality, with the feeling of the emotion\nexpressed. Though most philosophers appeal to ordinary experience and\nempirical data to reject the plausibility of Kivy\u2019s position,\nthey admit the problem that motivates it, namely, the conceptual\ntension between the nature of music and the nature of the emotions we\nfeel in response to it. There is some consensus that emotions are\ncognitive, in the sense that they take intentional objects\u2014they\nare about things\u2014of certain kinds. For instance, in\norder to feel fear, one must believe that something is\nthreatening (the \u201cintentional object\u201d of the\nemotion). When one listens to a sad piece of music, however, one knows\nthere is nothing literally feeling sad, and thus it is puzzling that\none should be made sad by the experience.\n\nPart of the solution is that not all emotional responses (broadly\nconstrued) are cognitive (Robinson 1994; 2005: 387\u2013400). For\ninstance, it is no more puzzling that one could be startled by a\nfortissimo blow to a bass drum than that one could so respond\nto a thunderclap. Another part of the solution is that the music can\nbe the object of our emotions, as when we are delighted by an\neffective ending to a long and complex piece.\n\nAs for emotional responses to music\u2019s expressiveness, there are\nat least two possible explanations. One appeals to the phenomenon of\n\u201cemotional contagion\u201d or \u201cmirroring responses\u201d\n(S. Davies 1994: 279\u2013307; 2006: 186\u20138). When surrounded by\nmoping people, one tends to become sad. Moreover, such a\n\u201cmood\u201d is not about some intentional object. One\nis not necessarily sad for the mopers, nor whatever they are\nsad about, if anything. Similarly, when \u201csurrounded\u201d by\nmusic that presents an appearance of sadness, one might become sad,\nbut not sad about the music, or anything else (Radford 1991). For\ncritical discussion, see Robinson 2005: 379\u2013412 and S. Davies\n2011b.\n\nIf our experience of music\u2019s expressiveness necessarily involves\nimagining that the music is a literal expression of emotion,\nthen our emotional responses to that expressiveness are no more\npuzzling than emotional responses to other imagined expressive agents,\nsuch as fictional characters in novels. The advantage is only slight\nbecause the question of how and why we respond emotionally to fictions\nis itself a philosophical problem of some magnitude. Nonetheless,\nthere are several theories available (see the\n supplement to the entry on imagination, \u00a72).\n One difficulty with appealing to a solution to the paradox of fiction\nis that it is not clear that our emotional responses to the\nexpressiveness of music are the same as those to emotionally\nexpressive characters. For instance, the standard example of an\nemotional response to music is being made sad by a dirge, while the\nstandard example of emotional response to fiction is (something like)\nto feel pity for a sad character. If the former is to be explained in\nthe same way as the latter, we would expect listeners to feel\npity in response to the funeral march (pity for the persona\nimagined to be expressing her sadness through it). However, we surely\ndo feel sad (in some sense) in response to tragedy, and it is not\nobvious that we do not feel pity (or imagined pity, or\nwhatever one\u2019s preferred theory of emotional response to fiction\nposits) in response to sad music.\n\nLeaving behind the topic of how and why we respond emotionally to\nmusic, we turn to the question of why we seek out music that arouses\n\u201cnegative\u201d emotions in us, such as sadness, assuming\nhenceforth that we are in fact aroused to such emotions. (Since this\nproblem is a close analog of the \u201cparadox of tragedy,\u201d\nsome of the references below are to literature not explicitly about\nmusic, but the transposition of the arguments to music is not\ndifficult to imagine. (See also the\n supplement to the entry on imagination, \u00a73.)\n Most solutions assume that our negative emotional response is a price\nwe are willing to pay for the benefits of engaging with the piece in\nquestion. The benefits appealed to include understanding and\nappreciating the music, including the expressiveness responsible for\nthe negative response (Goodman 1968: 247\u201351; S. Davies 1994:\n311\u201320; Goldman 1995: 68; Robinson 2005: 348\u201378).\n\nA different benefit is Aristotelian catharsis, in which our\nnegative emotional response to expressive art results in a\npsychological purgation of the negative emotions (Aristotle 1987: 6,\n1449b21\u20131450b20). A less therapeutic approach is the suggestion\nthat, since these emotions are without \u201clife implications\u201d\n(that is, as discussed above, we are not sad about any actual\ntragic events), we are able to take advantage of our responses to\nsavor these emotions, gain an understanding of them, and be reassured\nthat we have the capacity to feel them (Levinson 1982). Two things\nthat must be explained by any defender of this kind of response are,\nfirst, our persistence in seeking out music that elicits negative\nemotional experiences after we have received the resulting benefit\nand, second, the enjoyment we seem to take in these negative\nresponses, as opposed to putting up with them for their related\nbenefits.\n\nA different kind of solution to the problem argues that responses such\nas sadness that are evoked by expressive music are not really\nnegative. Hume (1757) argues, with respect to tragedy, that the\npleasure we take in the mode of presentation of the content of an\nartwork does not simply counterbalance the negative emotion evoked,\nbut rather subsumes and transforms it into a pleasurable feeling.\nKendall Walton argues (also with respect to tragedy) that sadness is\nnot in itself negative. Rather, it is the situation to which sadness\nis the response that is negative. Thus, though we would not seek out\nthe death of a loved one, given the death we\n\u201cwelcome\u201d the sorrow (K. Walton 1990: 255\u20139).\nSimilarly, we cannot affect the sadness of a musical work by not\nlistening to it, and so we welcome our sorrowful response to it as\nappropriate. Berys Gaut (2007: 203\u201326) argues that though\nsadness is typically aroused by situations we would prefer to\navoid, sadness in response to artistic expressiveness is an exception\nand thus not negative in any paradoxical way. A difficulty for all\nthree solutions is the extent to which they accord with our emotional\nexperience in rejecting the characterization of our sadness as\nnegative.\n4. Understanding Music\n\nA central topic in the understanding of narrative art forms, such as\nliterature and film, is what constitutes an acceptable interpretation\nof a work. One debate concerns whether there is a single correct\ninterpretation of any work or multiple acceptable interpretations.\nAnother concerns the constraints on acceptable interpretations, e.g.,\nthe extent to which the artist\u2019s intentions may or should be\ntaken into account.\n\nThough these questions seem equally applicable to musical works (S.\nDavies 2002a; Dubiel 2011), most of the literature on understanding\nmusic has focused on two more specifically musical topics: first, our\nunderstanding of basic musical features, such as pitch and rhythm and,\nsecond, interpretations of works of the sort given by music theorists.\n(For more detailed introductions to these and other topics in musical\nunderstanding, see S. Davies 2011c and Huovinen 2011.)\n\nBefore we turn to those topics, it is worth noting that two distinct\nactivities go by the name of \u201cinterpretation\u201d in music\n(and other performance arts): what might be called\nperformative and critical interpretation (Levinson\n1993). While a critical interpretation of a musical work (often called\nan analysis) is roughly equivalent to an interpretation of a\nnovel\u2014typically expressed linguistically\u2014a performative\ninterpretation is a way of playing or singing the work, typically\nexpressed in a performance of it. It is not easy to clarify the\nrelationship between these two kinds of musical interpretation, but\nsee Levinson 1993, Maus 1999, Thom 2007, Neufeld 2012, and Dodd\n2020a.\n4.1 Basic Musical Understanding\n\nAnimals can hear music in a sense\u2014your dog might be frightened\nby the loud noise emitted by your stereo. People, by contrast, can\nunderstand the music they hear. What constitutes this\nexperience of understanding music? To use an analogy, while the mere\nsound of a piece of music might be represented by a sonogram,\nour experience of it as music is better represented by\nsomething like a marked-up score. We hear individual notes that make\nup distinct melodies, harmonies, rhythms, sections, and so on, and the\ninteraction between these elements. Such musical understanding comes\nin degrees along a number of dimensions. Your understanding of a given\npiece or style may be deeper than mine, while the reverse is true for\nanother piece or style. My general musical understanding may be\nnarrow, in the sense that I only understand one kind of music, while\nyou understand many different kinds (Budd 1985b: 233\u20135; S.\nDavies 2011c: 88\u201395). Moreover, different pieces or kinds of\npieces may call on different abilities, since some music has no\nharmony to speak of, some no melody, and so on. Many argue that, in\naddition to purely musical features, understanding the emotions\nexpressed in a piece is essential to adequately understanding it\n(e.g., Ridley 1993; S. Davies 1994; Levinson 1990d: 30; Scruton 1997;\nRobinson 2005: 348\u201378).\n\nAt the base of the musical experience seem to be (i) the experience of\ntones, as opposed to mere sounds of various frequencies,\nwhere a tone is heard as being in \u201cmusical space,\u201d that\nis, as bearing relations to other tones such as being higher or lower,\nor of the same kind (at the octave), and (ii) the experience of\nmovement, as when we hear a melody as leaping up or wandering\nfar afield and then coming to rest where it began. Roger Scruton\n(1983; 1997: 1\u201396) argues that these experiences are irreducibly\nmetaphorical, since they involve the application of spatial concepts\nto that which is not literally spatial. (There is no identifiable\nindividual that moves from place to place in a melody (S. Davies 1994:\n229\u201334).) Malcolm Budd (1985b) argues that to appeal to metaphor\nin this context is unilluminating since, first, it is unclear what it\nmeans for an experience to be metaphorical and, second, a\nmetaphor is only given meaning through its interpretation, which\nScruton not only fails to give, but argues is unavailable. Budd\nsuggests that the metaphor is reducible, and thus eliminable,\napparently in terms of purely musical (i.e., non-spatial) concepts or\nvocabulary. Stephen Davies (1994: 234\u201340) doubts that the\nspatial vocabulary can be eliminated, but he is sympathetic to\nBudd\u2019s rejection of the centrality of metaphor. Instead, he\nargues that our use of spatial and motion terms to describe music is a\nsecondary, but literal, use of those terms that is widely used to\ndescribe temporal processes, such as the ups and downs of the stock\nmarket, the theoretical position one occupies, one\u2019s spirits\nplunging, and so on. The debate continues in Budd 2003, Scruton 2004,\nand S. Davies 2011d.\n\nDavies is surely right about the ubiquity of the application of the\nlanguage of space and motion to processes that lack individuals\nlocated in space. The appeal to secondary literal meanings, however,\ncan seem as unsatisfying as the appeal to irreducible metaphor. We do\nnot hear music simply as a temporal process, it might be objected, but\nas moving in the primary sense of the word, though\nwe know that it does not literally so move. Andrew Kania (2015)\ndevelops a position out of this intuition by emphasizing\nScruton\u2019s appeal to imagination while dropping the appeal to\nmetaphor, arguing that hearing the music as moving is a matter of\nimagining that its constituent sounds move. (See also de Clercq 2007\nand Trivedi 2011: 116\u201318.) Kania explicitly models his theory on\nthe popular Waltonian theory of fiction (K. Walton 1990), though\nWalton seems to resist the application of his theory to basic musical\nunderstanding because of the differences between music and more\nparadigmatically representational arts (K. Walton 1988: 358\u20139,\n1994: 53\u20134).\n\nApart from pitch space and melodic movement, there has been little\nphilosophical discussion of either the nature and understanding of\nbasic musical features such as melody, rhythm, meter, and harmony or\nhow these elements work together in complex musical wholes. But see\nRoger Scruton 1997: 19\u201379, 2007; Stephen Davies 2001:\n47\u201371; Hamilton 2007: 119\u201352; and Cheyne, Hamilton, and\nPaddison 2020.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that explicit music-theoretical knowledge\ncan aid deeper musical understanding and is essential for the adequate\ndescription and understanding of musical experiences\u2014including\none\u2019s own (Kivy 1990). However, several philosophers have argued\nthat one need not possess these concepts explicitly (nor the\ncorrelative vocabulary) in order to listen with understanding (Budd\n1985b; 245\u20138; S. Davies 1994: 346\u20139; Levinson 1990d:\n35\u201341). Mark DeBellis (1995: 117\u201331) argues that\nunderstanding fairly basic features of music, such as different kinds\nof cadences, requires a fused experience in which one applies a\nconcept such as dominant seventh in one\u2019s perception of\nthe musical sounds. Stephen Davies (2011c: 88\u201394) responds that\nthe serious but untutored listener should be able to develop\nsuch concepts, and thus have such experiences. Erkki Huovinen (2008)\nprovides an example intended to cast doubt on this. Suppose that a\nmelody is transposed from C major to D-flat major, but in a lower\noctave. One listener might hear the melody as reappearing\nhigher, since D-flat is a half-step above C, while another\nmight hear it as lower, since the constituent pitches of the\nsecond appearance are all lower than those of the first. Only a\nlistener who understands the sense in which both these claims\nare true\u2014that the melody has been transposed down a major\nseventh\u2014truly understands what is going on musically. Yet such\nconcepts of pitch organization \u2026 are not usually learned\nwithout some tuition (Huovinen 2008: 325).\n4.2 Higher-level Musical Understanding\n\nFor various art-historical reasons, formalism was the dominant\napproach to music-theoretic analysis, that is, the critical\ninterpretation of musical works, throughout the twentieth century.\n(Hamilton 2007: 66\u201394 & 153\u201391 provides a useful\ndiscussion of the history from a philosophical perspective.) In short,\nthe value of works of music was held to reside primarily in their\nlarge-scale harmonic structure.\n\nJerrold Levinson (1997) makes a case against such\n\u201carchitectonicism\u201d in favor of\n\u201cconcatenationism,\u201d the view that basic musical\nunderstanding consists in following the musical and emotional\nqualities of passages of music, and transitions between them, that are\nshort enough to be apprehended as a single experience\n(\u201cquasi-hearing\u201d). He qualifies this basic idea\nconsiderably, allowing for the experience of previous parts of the\npiece, and anticipation of future parts, to modify one\u2019s\nexperience of the music in the moment. He also allows that\narchitectonic awareness may play a role in enhancing one\u2019s\nmoment-to-moment experience, and may even play an ineliminable part in\nthe understanding of some pieces. Nonetheless, Levinson maintains that\nthe part played by architectonic knowledge in basic musical\nunderstanding is minimal, and that the cases where architectonic\nknowledge is necessary are very much the exception.\n\nPeter Kivy has taken up the gauntlet on behalf of architectonicism\n(2001; see also S. Davies 2011c: 95\u20139). While Kivy acknowledges\nthat the kinds of experiences Levinson champions are necessary to\nbasic musical understanding, he defends the idea that grasping the\nlarge-scale form of most pieces of Western classical music, at least,\nis necessary for an adequate understanding of them. He does not deny\nthat the experience of the form of a piece in listening to it is more\nintellectual than quasi-hearing, but he rejects Levinson\u2019s\nargument that it is non-perceptual, and thus marginal to an adequate\nexperience of it as music. Rather, Kivy argues, such experience is a\nmatter of bringing one\u2019s perceptions under sophisticated\nconcepts. (A tactic Kivy does not consider is an attempt to hoist\nLevinson with his own contextualist petard, arguing that even if\narchitectonic listening is non-perceptual it is a well-established\nmode of understanding pieces of music in the Western classical music\nworld, and thus that to argue music must be understood primarily\nperceptually is to beg the question.)\n\nThe extent of the disagreement between the architectonicist and the\nconcatenationist is unclear. They agree that the aspect of musical\nunderstanding the other emphasizes is a non-negligible component in\nthe full understanding of a musical work. Levinson has been explicit\nsince the first publication of his view that he intends it more as a\npolemic against and corrective to architectonicism, rather than as a\nreplacement for it (1997: ix\u2013xi; 1999: 485; 2006a). Perhaps that\npurpose has now been fulfilled, but see Huovinen 2013 for a revival of\nthe debate and an attempted synthesis.\n5. Music and Value\n5.1 Music\u2019s Artistic Value\n\nMost philosophical discussions of the value of music are implicitly\nrestricted to the artistic value of purely instrumental musical works.\nTo the extent that such discussions are motivated by the\nabstract nature of such music (see below), it is not clear to\nwhat extent they can be extended to musical hybrids such as song.\nMoreover, as we saw in section 1.2, it is not obvious that all music\nis art. Perhaps non-art music can be artistically valuable, but it\npresumably has other values; a complete theory of the value of music\nwould apparently have to account for those values. (Presumably, art\nmusic can also have non-artistic value.)\n\nFollowing the literature, however, the remainder of this subsection\nconsiders the artistic value of purely musical works. This is not the\nplace to go into the many disputes about the nature of aesthetic and\nartistic value. (For an excellent introduction, see Stecker 2003b.)\nFor our purposes, we can note there are two central points about\nartistic value on which there is some consensus. First, most\nphilosophers take the value of artworks to be intrinsic (or\ninherent) to them, in the sense that the value of a work is\ntied essentially to the experience that the work affords. Thus,\nartworks are not (properly) valued merely instrumentally, as means to\nsome end, but \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cin\u201d themselves (Budd\n1995: 1\u201316; S. Davies 1987: 198\u2013200; Scruton 1997:\n374\u20136; Levinson 1992: 15\u201317).\n\nThe question that naturally arises next is what it is about the\nexperience an artwork affords that makes it valuable. That\npleasure is a non-negligible part of the answer to this\nquestion is the second point upon which there is some consensus (S.\nDavies 1987: 198\u2013205; Levinson 1992; Kivy 1997b: 212\u201317).\nHowever, concomitant with this consensus is an acknowledgment that\nsimple pleasure taken, say, in the sensuousness of the musical sounds\nis too trivial to ground the great value widely attributed to music.\nIn looking for other sources, the puzzle that arises is that music is\nsupposed to be an abstract art, par excellence. If this means\nthat music is divorced from everything else that concerns us in the\n\u201creal world\u201d (that is, extra-musical life), it is puzzling\nwhy we should find so valuable the experiences musical works\nafford.\n\nThere are a couple of dimensions to most solutions of the puzzle of\npure music\u2019s value. One is the extent to which it is agreed that\nmusic really is abstract. To the extent that one thinks that music is\nnot divorced from the real world, one will be able to argue\nthat music\u2019s value is at least no more puzzling than the value\nof arts more obviously related to the real world, such as literature\nand representational painting and sculpture. The other dimension to\nmost solutions of the puzzle of pure music\u2019s value is the extent\nto which one thinks the abstractness of music is the source of its\nvalue. Thus, two theorists might agree on the extent to which music is\nrelated to the real world (by being expressive, say), yet one locate\nits primary value in that expressiveness while the other locates it in\nits abstract, purely formal features.\n\nUnsurprisingly, those who take the experience of music\u2019s\nexpressiveness to be a more intimately emotional one (through being\npredicated on imaginative engagement with the music, say), tend to\nemphasize that experience as more central to musical understanding,\nand thus attribute a larger part of music\u2019s value to its\nexpressiveness. Those, on the other hand, whose theory of the\nexperience of musical expressiveness is more distanced (a matter of\nnoticed resemblance, say), tend to place less weight on this element\nin their theories of musical value. At one extreme of this spectrum is\nthe position that denies music to be expressive at all, and thus\ncannot attribute any of music\u2019s value to its expressiveness\n(most notably Hanslick 1854; see also Zangwill 2004). Most theorists\nagree, however, that music\u2019s value is to be located in different\nkinds of experience, including the experience of formal and expressive\nfeatures; their disagreements are mostly about the relative weight of\nthese different kinds of experiences in a complete account of musical\nvalue.\n\nThe extent of the disagreement between various parties to this dispute\nis not clear. Those defending the value of music\u2019s\nexpressiveness tend to claim that its contribution to overall musical\nvalue is significant, but many stop short even of according it primary\nvalue, and do not argue against the value of formal elements of\nmusical works (Ridley 1995: 192\u20136; Levinson 1982, 1992:\n20\u20132, 1996a: 124\u20135; Robinson 2005: 413; Young 2014:\n150\u20134). They content themselves rather with pointing out the\nways in which expressiveness can be valuable, focusing largely on the\nvalue of the emotional responses such expressiveness elicits in us.\nThese include many of the features discussed above with respect to our\ninterest in listening to music that arouses negative affective states\nin the listener. To recap, our emotional responses to music\u2019s\nexpressiveness can enable us to savor, understand, and even (to some\nextent) experience emotions in a \u201csafe\u201d way. They can\nprovide us with a cathartic release, and enable us to participate in a\nkind of communication with the composer or communion with other\nmembers of our musical culture (Levinson 1982, 1996a; Higgins 1991,\n2012; S. Davies 1994: 271). Emphasizing this last point, Roger Scruton\nargues that music\u2019s value is quasi-moral, in that the kinds of\nmusic one responds to, or those valued in a particular culture,\nreflect the state of that individual\u2019s or culture\u2019s\n\u201csoul\u201d (1997: 380\u201391; see also S. Davies 1994:\n275\u20136.) Stephen Davies (1987: 207\u201312) has argued that\nthere are beneficial consequences of an interest in music in\ngeneral, such as heightened emotional and aural sensitivity,\nwhich are not properly valued as consequences of listening to\nindividual pieces, but which lead us to value musical culture as a\nwhole (just as we value kindness for its consequences in general,\nwhile rejecting instrumental motivations for kind acts as\ninappropriate).\n\nBy contrast, those who defend the value of formal features tend to\nargue that the value of those features is primary, and that the value\nof music\u2019s expressiveness is overrated. Peter Kivy, for\ninstance, argues that expressive properties serve merely to\nhighlight musical structure, as color might be used by the painter to\nemphasize contour or mass. Other expressive properties serve as\nstructural properties in their own right (1990: 196). (See also\nSharpe 2000: 1\u201383, and Zangwill 2004.)\n\nAlan Goldman (1992) argues against the idea that music is particularly\nsuited to the expression of emotion, claiming that representational\narts such as painting and literature are better at this. Moreover, he\ndisputes the grounds of the value of expressiveness given above. For\nexample, he denies that music can teach us much about the emotions,\nand that we can savor our negative emotional responses to expressive\nmusic. Similarly, after an extensive discussion of the nature of\nmusical expressiveness, Malcolm Budd argues that such expressiveness\ncannot come close to explaining music\u2019s value (1995:\n155\u20137). He points to the facts that much valuable music is not\nexpressive and that the equal expressiveness of different pieces would\nbe outweighed in a comparative evaluation by the differences between\nthem in terms of formal value.\n\nBoth Goldman and Budd locate the value of pure music precisely in the\nabstractness that to some seems the greatest obstacle to explaining\nthat value. Budd (1995: 164\u201371) points out that we have an\nextensive interest in abstract forms outside the realm of music, such\nas those of natural formations and in the decorative arts, and that\nsuch forms are capable of possessing valued aesthetic properties, such\nas beauty, elegance, and so on. Thus, it is no surprise that we value\nhighly the works of an art of abstract forms. Goldman (1992),\nby contrast, emphasizes the detachment from the world of practical\naffairs implied by music\u2019s abstractness. The complexity of great\nmusical works demands the active engagement of our cognitive\nfaculties, which we find rewarding, yet not in the pursuit of some\npractical goal that could be frustrated.\n\nThese issues are thrown into sharp relief in the debate over how\ninstrumental musical works could be \u201cprofound.\u201d See Kivy\n1990: 202\u201318, 1997b: 140\u201378, 2003; Levinson 1992; White\n1992; Ridley 1995, 2004: 132\u201365; S. Davies 2002b; Dodd\n2014b.\n\nThere is no space here to discuss the evaluation of musical works and\nperformances. See S. Davies 1987, Levinson 1990e, and Gracyk 2011.\n5.2 Music\u2019s Moral Value\n\nThere are musical aspects or elements of many uncontroversially\nrepresentational art forms, such as song. Jeanette Bicknell (2015:\n81\u201391) and Aaron Smuts (2013) discusses the ethics of song\nperformance. But there has been little discussion, in the analytic\ntradition, of the relationship between musical and ethical values (as\nopposed to musical examples of more general ethical concerns, such as\ncultural appropriation). Kathleen Higgins (1991, 2012) and Roger\nScruton (1997: 457\u2013508) argue in very different ways that music\nis \u2013 or should be \u2013 central to our thinking about ethics.\nGarry Hagberg has explored many connections between improvisatory jazz\npractice, ethics, and politics (2002, 2006, 2008, 2021; see also\nHiggins 1991: 177). Peter Kivy (2008) argues against music\u2019s\ncapacity to affect our moral knowledge, behavior, or character.\nJerrold Levinson (2013: 51\u20135), Philip Alperson (2014), and James\nHarold (2016) defend music\u2019s moral efficacy.\n\nThe debate over whether an artwork\u2019s moral flaws are artistic\nflaws has focused almost exclusively on representational (especially\nnarrative) art forms. (Gaut (2007) offers an excellent overview.)\nMusic has largely been ignored because it has been assumed to lack\nsufficient representational capacity to embody an attitude toward some\nobject. Maria Jos\u00e9 Alcaraz Le\u00f3n (2012), however, argues\nthat music\u2019s emotional expressiveness is enough to apply\narguments about whether moral flaws are artistic flaws to pure\ninstrumental music. (For critical discussion, see Kania 2020:\n254\u20135.) Musicologist Susan McClary argues that canonical works\nof instrumental classical music oppress women by expressing a positive\nattitude toward narratives of the subjection of feminine elements\n(e.g., certain musical themes) by masculine ones. (See, for example,\nMcClary 1991: 19\u201323, 53\u201379; for critical discussion, see\nMaus (2011).)\n",
