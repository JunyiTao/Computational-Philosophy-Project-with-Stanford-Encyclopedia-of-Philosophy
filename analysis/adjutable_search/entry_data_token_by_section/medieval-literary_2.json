    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Aphorism\n2.2 Aphorism\n\nThis form is not terribly common in the medieval period. Two works\nworthy of mention are Al-Farabi\u2019s political aphorisms and a text\nattributed to Hermes Trismegistus, but thought to have been written in\nthe 12th century by a Christian Neoplatonist, called The Book of\nTwenty-Four Philosophers. This text consists of twenty-four\ndefinitions of God, the most famous of which is, \u201cGod is an\ninfinite sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is\nnowhere,\u201d quoted by Alan of Lille, Meister Eckhart, and others\n(Hudry 1997). Al-Farabi\u2019s work, known as \u201cSelected\nAphorisms\u201d, gets this title from its opening lines, in which\nAl-Farabi says the work consists of selected aphorisms from the\nancients (Plato and Aristotle) \u201cconcerning that by which cities\nought to be governed and made prosperous...\u201d (Butterworth 2001,\n5\u20136). This \u201cprimer for politics\u201d contains discussion\nof the nature of the soul, virtue, the virtuous regime, and happiness.\nIts disjointed character and the way in which Al-Farabi composes it\nnot from his own views but those of Aristotle and Plato make the form\nof the work central to its meaning: Is Al-Farabi endorsing views but\nwithout saying outright that they are his own because to hold them\nmight be dangerous? What are the principles of selection at work? What\nis not being said? The aphoristic form seems to raise some of the same\nquestions about possible esoteric motivations as does the allegorical\nform. In the case of The Book of the Twenty-Four Philosophers\nthe form seems to derive from the inaccessibility of the divine nature\nto human intellection. Thus, one comes closer to avoiding\nmisrepresentation of the divine nature by using paradoxical or\nmetaphoric formulations rather than literal ones.\n\nSome medieval works fall somewhere between aphorism and axiom in\ngenre, most significantly works connected to the important and\ninfluential Liber de causis. The Liber circulated as\na work of Aristotle under the title Liber Aristotelis de\nexpositione bonitatis purae until the 13th century, when Thomas\nAquinas found its source in Proclus\u2019s Elements of\nTheology. Like Proclus\u2019s theology, the work seems to\npresent its principles as axioms, but the principles and their\nexplanation/derivation is not really demonstrative and the principles\nthemselves are highly abstract Neoplatonic metaphysical principles\nthat are sometimes as paradoxical as they are self-evident.\nBoethius\u2019s theological opuscule known as De\nHebdomadibus (this work is traditionally the third of five\ntheological tractates) and Alan of Lille\u2019s Regulae Caelestis\nIuris are presented as axiomatic but also esoteric, with the\nexpress statement of the author that their principles are not\naccessible to the many. (See section 2.3 below, on axiom, for more\ndiscussion of these works.)\n",
