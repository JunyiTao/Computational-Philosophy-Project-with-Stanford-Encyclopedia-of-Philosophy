    "main_text": "Two More Paradoxes || The Paradox of Place\n4.1 The Paradox of Place\n\nZeno\u2019s difficulty demands an explanation; for if everything that\nexists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ad\ninfinitum. (Aristotle Physics, 209a23)\n\n\nWhen he sets up his theory of place\u2014the crucial spatial notion\nin his theory of motion\u2014Aristotle lists various theories and\nproblems that his predecessors, including Zeno, have formulated on the\nsubject. The argument again raises issues of the infinite, since the\nsecond step of the argument argues for an infinite regress of\nplaces. However, Aristotle presents it as an argument against the very\nidea of place, rather than plurality (thereby likely taking it out of\ncontext). It is hard to feel the force of the conclusion, for why\nshould there not be an infinite series of places of places of places\nof \u2026? Presumably the worry would be greater for someone who\n(like Aristotle) believed that there could not be an actual infinity\nof things, for the argument seems to show that there are. But as we\nhave discussed above, today we need have no such qualms; there seems\nnothing problematic with an actual infinity of places.\n\nThe only other way one might find the regress troubling is if one\nholds that bodies have \u2018absolute\u2019 places, in the sense\nthat there is always a unique privileged answer to the question\n\u2018where is it\u2019? The problem then is not that there are\ninfinitely many places, but just that there are many. And Aristotle\nmight have had this concern, for in his theory of motion, the natural\nmotion of a body is determined by the relation of its place to the\ncenter of the universe: an account that requires place to be\ndeterminate, because natural motion is. (See Sorabji 1988 and Morrison\n2002 for general, competing accounts of Aristotle\u2019s views on place;\nchapter 3 of the latter especially for a discussion of Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatment of the paradox.) But supposing that one holds that place is\nabsolute for whatever reason, then for example, where am I as I write?\nIf the paradox is right then I\u2019m in my place, and I\u2019m also\nin my place\u2019s place, and my place\u2019s place\u2019s place,\nand my \u2026. Since I\u2019m in all these places any might\nseem an appropriate answer to the question. Various responses are\nconceivable: deny absolute places (especially since our physics does\nnot require them), define a notion of place that is unique in all\ncases (arguably Aristotle\u2019s solution), or perhaps claim that places\nare their own places thereby cutting off the regress!\n\n",
