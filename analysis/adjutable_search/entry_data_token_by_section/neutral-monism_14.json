    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || Reduction and the Threat of Elimination\n4.1 Reduction and the Threat of Elimination\n\nEvery version of reductionism must deal with the question of the\nontological status of the entities it reduces: are they retained or\neliminated? Both of these components are typically present in\ntraditional neutral\n monism.[17]\n Mach, for instance, alternates between claims such as that \u201cthe\nsupposed unities \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018ego\u2019 are only\nmakeshifts, designed for provisional survey and for certain practical\nends\u201d and claims that they are composites constituted by\n\u201ca more strongly coherent group of elements [that is] less\nstrongly connected with other groups of this kind\u201d (Mach 1886:\n20\u201321). Similarly, alongside Russell\u2019s many logical\nconstructions of various mental phenomena are remarks such as\nthis:\n\nThere are a number of words which I think should disappear from the\npsychological vocabulary: among these I should include\nknowledge, memory, perception, and\nsensation. (Russell 1996: 295)\n\n\nWhat is clear is that neutral monism dispenses with mind as\ntraditionally conceived by dualists and idealists and matter\nas traditionally conceived by dualists and materialists.\nThere is no need to suppose that there are \u201csolid persistent\nobjects moving through space\u201d or states with an inbuilt and\nprimitive \u201creference to objects\u201d (Russell 1921: 124, 36).\nBut, on the other hand, it provides constructions of neutral entities\nthat are designed to play the roles of the entities they displace. The\nsuccess of this strategy will have to be assessed on a case by case\nbasis. There are relatively few objections to neutral monism that turn\non the details of proposed constructions or reductions. (But see C.D.\nBroad\u2019s critique of Russell, 1925: 577\u2013584). The most\nchallenging criticisms of neutral monism do not engage with technical\ndetails, but aim squarely at the central idea of the\ndoctrine\u2014the idea of neutrality.\n",
