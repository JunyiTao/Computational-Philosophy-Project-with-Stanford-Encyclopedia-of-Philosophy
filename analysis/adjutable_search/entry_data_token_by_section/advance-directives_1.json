Challenges to the orthodox view regarding the never competent\n\n\nConcerning patients who have never been competent, the orthodox view,\nas it is typically interpreted, may be misleading in certain cases. By\nrecommending the Best Interests standard as opposed to the Substituted\nJudgment standard, the orthodox view may help create the impression\nthat, for those who have never had decision-making capacity, only a\none-size-fits-all objective assessment of their interests, based on\ngeneric goals such as prolonging life or avoiding pain, is\navailable. However, a person may lack decision-making capacity but\nnonetheless possess the proper starting points of decision-making, so\nthat a surrogate could still reconstruct deeply personal and\nidiosyncratic choices on the person's behalf. Consider a child or a\nmildly retarded patient who lacks the capacity to make a sophisticated\nmedical decision because she cannot fully grasp the complex\nconsequences of the available options, or because, if left to her own\ndevices, she would merely choose impulsively. Yet, very meaningful and\npersonally distinctive issues may be at stake for this individual: for\ninstance, alternative treatments may differently impact her\nrelationships with loved ones or differently affect her ability to\ncontinue participating in deeply valued activities such as painting or\ndancing. In such cases, to best serve the interests of the patient,\nsurrogates arguably need to reconstruct the subjective point of view\nof the patient, and not just fall back on generic choices that\n\u201ca reasonable person\u201d would make under the\ncircumstances. In short, sometimes \u2014 especially in dealing with\npatients with rich inner lives whose decision-making is nevertheless\nimpaired \u2014 the application of the Best Interests standard may\nlook an awful lot like an exercise of Substituted Judgment.\n\n\nIt is only with regards to patients who do not even possess the\nstarting points of decisions \u2014 for example, infants or more severely\nbrain damaged individuals \u2014 that the idea of reconstructing the\nindividual's own point of view as a basis for a decision does not even\ncoherently apply, and the more generic application of the Best\nInterests standard is called for.\n\n\nNonetheless, this is only a challenge to the narrow way in which the\nBest Interests standard has typically been employed: a more nuanced\ninterpretation of the orthodox view can handle the cases of the\nnever-competent appropriately. The application of Best Interests can,\nin many instances, procedurally resemble the application of\nSubstituted Judgment because, on any reasonable theory of\n well-being,\na large part of what counts as good for a person is attaining what she\nvalues or succeeding in what she cares about. It is thus not\nsurprising that reconstructing the individual's viewpoint is an\nimportant part of a nuanced interpretation of Best Interests. Yet,\neven though in employing the Best Interests standard one usually must\ntake very seriously the subject's own viewpoint, one is not thereby\nrecreating the autonomous choice the person would have made. This is\nparticularly clear for those who have never been competent: one cannot\nbe respecting their autonomy (at least not on the usual understanding\nof autonomous choice), since they have never had autonomy. Moreover,\neven in undertaking to respect their \"starting points of\ndecision-making,\" one would not treat these starting points as\nentirely decisive. An individual who has never been competent may\nvalue something that would be terribly destructive to her other values\n(and be incapable of realizing this), and so, to protect her, the Best\nInterests standard would have to focus on those other values. So here\nagain the application of the Best Interests standard diverges from\nwhat would most plausibly count as a reconstruction of the subject's\nown autonomous choice. Given that Substituted Judgment is grounded in\nrespect for autonomy, it is thus clear why, according to the orthodox\nview, Substituted Judgment makes no sense for the never-competent, and\nwhy the orthodox view prescribes for them the Best Interests standard,\nalbeit interpreted in a suitably broad way.\n\n \nAs already noted, different views on how to apply the Best Interests\nstandard roughly correspond to different theories of\n well-being.  \nHowever, theories of well-being are normally developed with an\nordinary fully-capacitated human being in mind, so, when applied to\nthose whose incompetence is due, in part, to substantial deviations\nfrom this paradigm, some theories need to be adjusted to accommodate\nhuman beings who do not at the time, or ever, possess the paradigm\ncapacities these theories presume (for example, the capacity to\nexperience the pleasures of the intellect, or the capacity to\ndesire). The understanding of well-being and the specifics of applying\nthe Best Interests standard in such cases must be tailored to the\ndetails of each particular real-life condition \u2014 and to the\ncorresponding levels of mental functioning.  Interests of children,\nincluding infants, have received some attention in the literature\n(Buchanan and Brock 1990, ch.5, Schapiro 1999); similar tailor-made\nanalyses are needed for individual mental illnesses and brain\ndeficits.\n",
