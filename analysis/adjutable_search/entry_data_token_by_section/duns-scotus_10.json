    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || The attack on skepticism and illuminationism\n4.3 The attack on skepticism and illuminationism\n\nScotus argues that the human intellect is capable of achieving\ncertainty in its knowledge of the truth simply by the exercise of its\nown natural powers, with no special divine help. He therefore opposes\nboth skepticism, which denies the possibility of certain knowledge,\nand illuminationism, which insists that we need special divine\nillumination in order to attain certainty. He works out his attack on\nboth doctrines in the course of a reply to Henry of Ghent in\nOrdinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4. (For a translation, see van\nden Bercken [2016], 114\u2013143.)\n\nAccording to Henry, truth involves a relation to an\n\u201cexemplar.\u201d (We can think of this relation as akin to the\nrelation of correspondence appealed to by certain theories of truth,\nand the exemplar itself as the mental item that is one of the relata\nof the correspondence-relation. The other relatum, of course, is\n\u201cthe way things really are.\u201d) Now there are two exemplars:\nthe created exemplar, which is the species of the universal caused by\nthe thing known, and the uncreated exemplar, which is an idea in the\ndivine mind. Henry argues that the created exemplar cannot provide us\nwith certain and infallible knowledge of a thing. For, first, the\nobject from which the exemplar is abstracted is itself mutable and\ntherefore cannot be the cause of something immutable. And how can\nthere be certain knowledge apart from some immutable basis for that\nknowledge? Second, the soul itself is mutable and subject to error,\nand it can be preserved from error only by something less mutable than\nitself. But the created exemplar is even more mutable than the soul.\nThird, the created exemplar by itself does not allow us to distinguish\nbetween reality and dreaming, since the content of the exemplar is the\nsame in either case. Henry therefore concludes that if we are to have\ncertainty, we must look to the uncreated exemplar. And since we cannot\nlook to the uncreated exemplar by our natural powers, certainty is\nimpossible apart from some special divine illumination.\n\nScotus argues that if Henry is right about the limitations of our\nnatural powers, even divine illumination is not enough to save us from\npervasive uncertainty. To Henry\u2019s first argument he replies that\nthere is no certainty to be had by knowing a mutable object as\nimmutable. To the second he replies that anything in the\nsoul\u2014including the very act of understanding that Henry thinks\nis achieved through illumination\u2014is mutable. So by Henry\u2019s\nargument it would be impossible for anything whatever to preserve the\nsoul from error. And to the third argument he replies that if the\ncreated exemplar is such as to preclude certainty, adding extra\nexemplars will not solve the problem: \u201cWhen something\nincompatible with certainty concurs, certainty cannot be\nattained\u201d (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4, n.\n221).\n\nSo Henry\u2019s arguments, far from showing that certainty is\npossible through divine illumination, actually lead to a pervasive\nskepticism. Scotus counters that we can show that skepticism is false.\nWe can in fact attain certainty, and we can do so by the unaided\nexercise of our natural intellectual powers. There are four types of\nknowledge in which infallible certainty is possible. First, knowledge\nof first principles is certain because the intellect has only to form\nsuch judgments to see that they are true. (And since the validity of\nproper syllogistic inference can be known in just this way, it follows\nthat anything that is seen to be properly derived from first\nprinciples by syllogistic inference is also known with certainty.)\nSecond, we have certainty with respect to quite a lot of causal\njudgments derived from experience. Third, Scotus says that many of our\nown acts are as certain as first principles. It is no objection to\npoint out that our acts are contingent, since some contingent\npropositions must be known immediately (that is, without needing to be\nderived from some other proposition). For otherwise, either some\ncontingent proposition would follow from a necessary proposition\n(which is impossible), or there would be an infinite regress in\ncontingent propositions (in which case no contingent proposition would\never be known). Fourth, certain propositions about present sense\nexperience are also known with certainty if they are properly vetted\nby the intellect in light of the causal judgments derived from\nexperience.\n",
