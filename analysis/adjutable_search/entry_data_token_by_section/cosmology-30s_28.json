    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology\n8. Steady-state Cosmology\n\nIn 1948, a young mathematician, Herman Bondi, in concert with two\nclose friends Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle, proposed a radical new\ncosmological theory, the Steady State theory. This theory\ndiffers from the basic picture shared by both kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology, namely, that of a universe with a definite\norigin in a small, dense knot, followed by evolution into the universe\nwe have today. According to Bondi\u2019s theory, the universe as far\nback into the past as we might look would always look the same; there\nwas no evolution, there could be no \u201cfossils\u201d, as Bondi\ncalled putative evidence of a universe different in the past from our\npresent one. What we observe today is the same state of a universe\nthat has been and always will be steady. Bondi came to his notion of\nthe steady state primarily from his commitment to the philosophical\ncomponents of Milne\u2019s work, most especially the methodology of\nrationalism plus hypothetico-deductivism; additionally, Bondi coupled\nto these Milnean notions some ideas taken directly from the philosophy\nof Karl Popper.\n",
