    "main_text": "Logic and Semantics || Mental Language, Connotation and Definitions\n3.3 Mental Language, Connotation and Definitions\n\nOckham was the first philosopher to develop in some detail the notion\nof \u201cmental language\u201d and to put it to work for him.\nAristotle, Boethius and several others had mentioned it before, but\nOckham\u2019s innovation was to systematically transpose to the\nfine-grained analysis of human thought both the grammatical categories\nof his time, such as those of noun, verb, adverb, singular, plural and\nso on, and \u2014 even more importantly \u2014 the central\nsemantical ideas of signification, connotation and supposition\nintroduced in the previous\n section.[22]\n Written words for him are \u201csubordinated\u201d to spoken words,\nand spoken words in turn are \u201csubordinated\u201d to mental\nunits called \u201cconcepts\u201d, which can be combined into\nsyntactically structured mental propositions, just as spoken and\nwritten words can be combined into audible or visible sentences.\n\nWhereas the signification of terms in spoken and written language is\npurely conventional and can be changed by mutual agreement (hence\nEnglish speakers say \u2018dog\u2019 whereas in French it is\nchien), the signification of mental terms is established by\nnature, according to Ockham, and cannot be changed at will. Concepts,\nin other words, are natural signs: my concept of dog\nnaturally signifies dogs. How this \u201cnatural signification\u201d\nis to be accounted for in the final analysis for Ockham is not\nentirely clear, but it seems to be based both on the fact that simple\nconcepts are normally caused within the mind by their objects (my\nsimple concept of dog originated in me as an effect of my perceptual\nencounter with dogs), and on the fact that concepts are in some way\n\u201cnaturally similar\u201d to their\n objects.[23]\n\n\nThis arrangement provides an account of synonymy and equivocation in\nspoken and written language. Two simple terms (whether from the same\nor different spoken or written languages) are synonymous if\nthey are ultimately subordinated to the same concept; a single given\nterm of spoken or written language is equivocal if it is\nultimately subordinated to more than one concept.\n\nThis raises an obvious question: Is there synonymy or equivocation in\nmental language itself? (If there is, it will obviously have to be\naccounted for in some other way than for spoken/written language.) A\ngreat deal of modern secondary literature has been devoted to this\nquestion. Trentman [1970] was the first to argue that no, there is no\nsynonymy or equivocation in mental language. On the contrary, mental\nlanguage for Ockham is a kind of lean, stripped down,\n\u201ccanonical\u201d language with no frills or inessentials, a\nlittle like the \u201cideal languages\u201d postulated by logical\natomists in the first part of the twentieth century. Spade [1980]\nlikewise argued in greater detail, on both theoretical and textual\ngrounds, that there is no synonymy or equivocation in mental language.\nMore recently, Panaccio [1990, 2004], Tweedale [1992] (both on largely\ntextual grounds), and Chalmers [1999] (on mainly theoretical grounds)\nhave argued for a different interpretation, which now tends to be more\nwidely accepted. What comes out at this point is that Ockham\u2019s\nmental language is not to be seen as a logically ideal\nlanguage and that it does incorporate both some redundancies and some\nambiguities.\n\nThe question is complicated, but it goes to the heart of much of what\nOckham is up to. In order to see why, let us return briefly to the\ntheory of\n connotation.[24]\n Connotation was described\n above\n in terms of primary and secondary signification. But in Summa of\nLogic I.10, Ockham himself draws the distinction between absolute\nand connotative terms by means of the theory of definition.\n\nFor Ockham, there are two kinds of definitions: real\ndefinitions and nominal definitions. A real definition is\nsomehow supposed to reveal the essential metaphysical structure of\nwhat it defines; nominal definitions do not do that. As Ockham sets it\nup, all connotative terms have nominal definitions, never\nreal definitions, and absolute terms (although not all of\nthem) have real definitions, never nominal definitions. (Some absolute\nterms have no definitions at\n all.[25])\n\nAs an example of a real definition, consider: \u2018Man is a rational\nanimal\u2019 or \u2018Man is a substance composed of a body and an\nintellective soul\u2019. Each of these traditional definitions is\ncorrect, and each in its own way expresses the essential metaphysical\nstructure of a human being. But notice: the two definitions do not\nsignify (make us think of) exactly the same things. The first\none makes us think of all rational things (in virtue of the first word\nof the definiens) plus all animals (whether rational or not, in virtue\nof the second word of the definiens). The second definition makes us\nthink of, among other things, all substances (in virtue of the word\n\u2018substance\u2019 in the definiens), whereas the first one does\nnot. It follows therefore that an absolute term can have several\ndistinct real definitions that don\u2019t always signify exactly the\nsame things. They will primarily signify\u2014be truly\npredicable of\u2014exactly the same things, since they will primarily\nsignify just what the term they define primarily signifies. But they\ncan also (secondarily) signify other things as\n well.[26]\n\nNominal definitions, Ockham says, are different: There is one and only\none nominal definition for any given connotative\n term.[27]\n While a real definition is expected to provide a structural\ndescription of certain things (which can be done in various ways, as\nwe just saw), a nominal definition, by contrast, is supposed to unfold\nin a precise way the signification of the connotative term it serves\nto define, and this can only be done, Ockham thinks, by explicitly\nmentioning, in the right order and with the right connections, which\nkind of things are primarily signified by this term and which are\nsecondarily signified. The nominal definition of the connotative term\n\u201cbrave\u201d, to take a simple example, is \u201ca living\nbeing endowed with bravery\u201d; this reveals that\n\u201cbrave\u201d primarily signifies certain living beings\n(referred to by the first part of the definition) and that it\nsecondarily signifies \u2014 or connotes \u2014 singular qualities\nof bravery (referred to by the last part of the\n definition).[28]\n Any non-equivalent nominal definition is bound to indicate a\ndifferent signification and would, consequently, be unsuitable if the\noriginal one was correct.\n\nNow, several commentators, following Trentman and Spade, concluded on\nthis basis that there are no simple connotative terms in\nOckham\u2019s mental language. They reasoned as follows: a\nconnotative term is synonymous with its nominal definition, but there\nis no synonymy in mental language according to Ockham; mental\nlanguage, therefore, cannot contain both a simple connotative term and\nits complex nominal definition; since it must certainly have the\nresources for formulating adequate definitions, what must be dispensed\nwith is the defined simple term; and since all connotative\nterms are supposed to have a nominal definition, it follows that\nmental language contains only absolute terms (along with\nsyncategorematic ones, of course). It even came to be supposed in this\nline of interpretation, that the very central point of Ockham\u2019s\nnominalist program was to show that if anything can be truly said\nabout the world, it can be said using only absolute and\nsyncategorematic terms, and that this is precisely what happens in\nmental language.\n\nThe consequences were far-reaching. Not only did this interpretation\nclaim to provide an overall understanding of what Ockham was up to,\nbut it also inevitably led to conclude that his whole nominalist\nprogram was bound to failure. All relational terms, indeed, are taken\nto be connotative terms in Ockham\u2019s semantics. The program,\nconsequently, was thought to require the semantical reduction of all\nrelational terms to combinations of non-relational ones, which seems\nhardly possible. Thus, the question whether there are simple\nconnotative terms or not in Ockham\u2019s mental language is crucial\nto our understanding of the success of his overall ontological\nproject. Since spoken and written languages are semantically\nderivative on mental language, it is vital that we get the semantics\nof mental language to work out right for Ockham, or else the\nsystematic coherence of much of what he has to say will be in\njeopardy.\n\nIn view of recent scholarship, though, it appears highly doubtful that\nOckham\u2019s purpose really was to use nominal definitions to\neliminate all simple connotative terms from mental language. For one\nthing, as Spade had remarked himself, Ockham never systematically\nengages in explicit attempts at such semantical reductions, which\nwould be quite odd if this was the central component of his\nnominalism. Furthermore it was shown that Ockham did in fact hold that\nthere are simple connotative terms in mental language. He\nsays it explicitly and repeatedly, and in a variety of texts from his\nearlier to his later philosophical and theological\n writings.[29]\n The secondary literature, consequently, has now gradually converged\non the view that, for Ockham, there is no synonymy among\nsimple terms in mental language, but that there can be some\nredundancy between simple terms and complex expressions, or between\nvarious complex expressions. If so, nothing prevents a simple\nconnotative concept to coexist in mental language with its nominal\ndefinition.\n\nOckham indeed explicitly denies that a complex definition is\nin general wholly synonymous with the corresponding defined\n term.[30]\n His point, presumably, is that the definition usually signifies\nmore things than the defined term. Take \u201cbrave\u201d\nagain. Its definition, remember, is \u201ca living being endowed with\nbravery\u201d. Now, the first part of this complex expression makes\nus think of all living beings, whereas the simple term\n\u201cbrave\u201d has only the brave ones as its primary\nsignificates and does not signify in any way the non-brave living\nbeings. This shows in effect that simple connotative terms are not\n\u2014 at least not always \u2014 shorthand abbreviations for their\nnominal definitions in Ockham\u2019s view. And it must be conjectured\nthat some simple connotative concepts can be directly\nacquired on the basis of perceptual experiences, just as absolute ones\nare supposed to be (think of a relational concept like \u201ctaller\nthan\u201d or a qualitative one like \u201cwhite\u201d).\n\nOckham\u2019s nominal definitions, then, should not be seen as\nreductionist devices for eliminating certain terms, but as a\nprivileged means for making conspicuous what the (primary and\nsecondary) significates of the defined terms are. The main point here\nis that such definitions, when correctly formulated, explicitly reveal\nthe ontological commitments associated with the normal use of the\ndefined terms. The definition of \u201cbrave\u201d as \u201ca\nliving being endowed with bravery\u201d, for example, shows that the\ncorrect use of the term \u201cbrave\u201d commits us only to the\nexistence of singular living beings and singular braveries.\nOckham\u2019s nominalism does not require the elimination of simple\nconnotative concepts after all; its main relevant thesis, on the\ncontrary, is that their use is ontologically harmless since they do\nnot signify (either primarily or secondarily) anything but individual\nthings, as their nominal definitions are supposed to make it\nclear.\n",
