    "main_text": "Ethical Implications and Core Ethical Issues || Privacy, Consent, and Non-voluntary Disclosure of Personal Information\n3.2 Privacy, Consent, and Non-voluntary Disclosure of Personal Information\n\n\nAt least two distinct kinds of privacy concerns arise in the context\nof search engines. One set of privacy issues emerges because search\nengine companies can collect personal information about search engine\nusers; in this scheme, the users are, in effect, \u201cdata\nsubjects\u201d for the search engine companies and their advertisers.\nHowever, search engine users themselves\u2014whether acting on their\nown behalf or on behalf of organizations that hire them\u2014can use\nthe technology to conduct online searches about people. In this case,\nthe targeted people (some of whom may never have used or possibly have\nnever even heard of a search engine) are the subjects of search engine\nusers. In both cases, privacy concerns arise in connection with\nquestions about fairness for the data subjects involved. Consider that\nmany of those who become the subjects of the search queries have not\nexplicitly consented either to having certain kinds of personal\ninformation about them collected or having personal information about\nthem (that has been collected in some other context) also being made\navailable on the Web, or both.\n\n\nIn this section, we examine search-engine-related privacy concerns\naffecting people who have become the subjects, or\n\u201ctargets,\u201d of queries by search engine users. This kind of\nprivacy concern is exacerbated by the ever expanding amount of personal\ninformation about ordinary people that is currently discoverable by\nsearch engines and thus accessible to Internet users. But why, exactly,\nis this problematic from the vantage point of privacy? For one thing,\nit is not clear that most people have voluntarily consented to having\ninformation about them placed in databases or in online forums that are\naccessible to search engines (and thus potentially available to any\nInternet user). And we noted that search engine users, whether they are\nacting simply on their own, or as representatives of business and\ncorporations, can and often do access a wealth of information about\nmany of us via search engines. Privacy advocates question whether this\npractice is fair, especially to people who have not explicitly\nconsented to having personal information about them included in the\nonline forums and databases that are now so easily searchable because\nof sophisticated search engine technology.\n\n\nPrivacy concerns that arise in contexts in which people are the subjects\nof search queries can be further differentiated in terms of two\nseparate categories, i.e., where search engines are used to: (i) track\nthe location of individuals, sometimes for the purpose of harassing or\nstalking them; and (ii) acquire personal information about people. We\nbriefly examine each practice.\n\n\nRegarding (i), one might ask why using search engines to track and\nlocate persons is controversial from a privacy perspective. First,\nconsider that some organizations have developed specialized search\nengines for questionable purposes, such as stalking people. For\nexample, one search facility (Gawker-Stalker Maps, introduced in 2006)\nwas designed specifically for the purpose of stalking famous people,\nincluding celebrities.  Imagine a case in which a celebrity has been\nspotted while dining at an up-scale restaurant in San Francisco. The\nperson who spots the celebrity can send a \u201ctip\u201d via text\nmessage or e-mail to Gawker-Stalker, informing the site\u2019s users\nof her whereabouts. The Gawker site then provides its users, via\nprecise GPS software, with information about exactly where, and at\nwhat time, she was last seen. Users interested in stalking that\ncelebrity can then follow her movements electronically, via the Gawker\nsite, or they can locate and follow her in physical space, if they\nhappen to be in the same geographical vicinity as the celebrity at\nthat time (Tavani 2016). Currently, Gawker-Stalker seems to be in a\nstate of transition. Although gawker.com, a subsidiary of Gawker\nMedia, ceased operations following a bankruptcy suit in 2016, the\ncontroversial Gawker site was acquired by the Bustle Digital Group in\n2018 (Kelly 2019).\n\n\nSecond, we note that it is not only celebrities and \u201chigh-profile\u201d\npublic figures that are vulnerable to being stalked, as well as to\nhaving personal information about them accessed, via search engines.\nConsider the case of Amy Boyer, a twenty-year old resident of New\nHampshire, who was stalked online by a former \u201cadmirer\u201d\nnamed Liam Youens and who was eventually murdered by him in 1999. Using\nstandard Internet search facilities, Youens was able to get all of the\ninformation about Boyer that he needed to stalk her\u2014i.e.,\ninformation about where she lived, worked, and so forth (see, for\nexample, Tavani and Gridzinsky, 2002). Incidents such as the Boyer case\ninvite us to question current policies\u2014or, in lieu of clear and\nexplicit policies, our default positions and assumptions\u2014with\nregard to the amount and the kind of personal information about\nordinary persons that is currently accessible to search engine users.\nIt now appears likely that Amy Boyer had no idea that so much personal\ninformation about her was so easily accessible online via search\nengines.\n\n\nWe next examine (ii), the use of search engines to find information\nabout people\u2014not about their location, but about their\nactivities, interests, and backgrounds. As in the Amy Boyer case, these\nsearch-engine-related privacy issues also arise when ordinary people\nbecome the subjects of search queries. Consider that, increasingly,\nemployers use online search techniques to acquire information about\nprospective and current employees. It is well known that many employers\ntry to access information on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts of job applicants\nthey are considering. This kind of information has, in certain\ninstances, been used by employers in determining whether or not to hire\nparticular applicants (and possibly also used in deciding whether or\nnot to promote current employees). So, for example, a college student\nwho posts on Facebook one or more pictures of himself drinking\nalcoholic beverages, or perhaps behaving wildly at a party, can\npotentially jeopardize his future employment opportunity with a company\nthat might otherwise hire him upon graduating from college. In defense\nof this kind of \u201cscreening\u201d practice used by companies in\nhiring employees, one could argue that the company has merely elected\nto use currently available tools to search for information about\npersons who voluntarily posted material (e.g., in the form of\nphotos, etc.) about themselves on Facebook.\n\n\nOur primary concern here is with personal information that has not\nbeen voluntarily disclosed by persons, but is nonetheless accessible\nonline via search engines. This kind of concern involving access to\npersonal information in online forums is by no means new or recent.\nConsider that in the decade preceding Facebook, employers had been\nable to access information about job applicants via online search\ntools\u2014e.g., they could (and did) use search engines to\naccomplish this task, simply by entering the name of the individual in\na search engine box. Imagine a hypothetical scenario in which a\nperson, Lee, applies for a full-time employment position at\nCorporation X. Also, imagine that someone on the\ncorporation\u2019s search committee for this position decides to conduct an\nonline search about Lee, shortly after receiving her\napplication. Further imagine that in response to the query about Lee,\nthree results are returned by the search engine.  One result includes\na link to a gay/lesbian organization in which Lee is identified as\nsomeone who contributed to a recent event hosted by that\norganization. Next, imagine that Lee is turned down for the job at\nCorporation X. Further imagine that Lee becomes curious as to\nwhy she might not have been selected for that job and she decides to\ndo an Internet search of her name for the first time. Lee then\ndiscovers the search result linking her to the gay/lesbian\norganization (Tavani 1998). Should Lee infer that she was denied the\njob because of her apparent association with this organization? Is\nthat a reasonable inference? Maybe not. Nevertheless, an important\nquestion arises: Is it fair that someone has posted this information\nabout Lee online, without her consent, to a source that is accessible\nto one or more search engines? Is that information about Lee now\n\u201cfair game,\u201d and should it be viewed simply as information\nthat is \u201cup for grabs\u201d (Nissenbaum 2004) and thus\nappropriate for use by prospective employers?\n\n\nHow is the scenario involving Lee different from a case in which an\nemployer uses information on a Facebook account to screen job\napplicants? For one thing, Facebook users typically post information\nabout themselves that can be seen by others and thus have voluntarily\nconsented to have that information available for others to access\n(assuming that they have not specified their Facebook privacy\nsettings). Furthermore, they are also aware that such information about\nthem exists on that online forum. But what about job applicants who do\nnot have accounts on Facebook, or on any other social networking site?\nAre they less vulnerable to online scrutiny by potential employers?\nMany people may have no idea about either the kind or amount of online\npersonal information about them that is accessible to an employer or to\nanyone using a search engine.\n\n\nNext consider a hypothetical scenario similar to Lee\u2019s, where\nPhil, who recently earned a Ph.D., is applying for a faculty position\nat University X. But suppose that a few disgruntled former students\nhave posted some highly critical and negative remarks about Phil on\nRateMyProfessor.com. Next, suppose that a member of the faculty search\ncommittee at University X conducts an online search on Phil and\ndiscovers the disparaging remarks made by the students. Finally, Phil\nis informed that he has not been selected for the faculty position.\nShortly after receiving his letter of rejection, Phil happens to\ndiscover the comments about him made by the disgruntled students, by\nconducting an online search of his name. Would it be unreasonable for\nPhil to infer that the remarks by these students on RateMyProfessor.com\ninfluenced the hiring committee\u2019s decision not to select him?\n\n\nIn one sense, Phil\u2019s predicament is very similar to\nLee\u2019s\u2014viz., neither job applicant had any kind of control\nover what people other than themselves had posted about them in online\nforums accessible to search engines. However, the negative information\nposted about Phil was directly related to the kind of criteria that\ntypically would be used in considering an applicant for a faculty\nposition. The information posted about Lee, while not directly related\nto the job for which she was applying, could nonetheless also harm her\nchances of gaining that position. In neither case, however, did Lee or\nPhil have any say about the kind of information about them, or about\nthe accuracy of that information, that could be so easily retrieved\nonline and used by a prospective employer in making a decision about\nwhether or not to hire them.\n\n\nOn the one hand, we can ask what kind of recourse people like Phil\nand Lee could expect to have in situations such as this\u2014e.g.,\ncan they reasonably expect to have control over any kind of information\nabout them that is currently accessible to search engines? But, on the\nother hand, it may not seem totally unreasonable for them to have some\nexpectation of limited control over their personal information, even if\nonly to be able to challenge the legitimacy of inaccurate information,\nespecially when they had not consented to having it included in online\nforums and databases accessible to search\n engines.[2]\nThere is also an aspect of this kind of personal information that\noverlaps with \u201cpublic\u201d information. So, perhaps the\ntension that arises in these scenarios can be viewed as a contemporary\nvariation of the age-old debate about the private vs. public nature of\npersonal information. This tension is further complicated by the fact\nthat in the U.S. most people, as the subjects of online searches,\nenjoy little, if any, normative protection regarding personal\ninformation about them that is now available online\u2014mainly\nbecause of the presumed \u201cpublic nature\u201d of this personal\ninformation involved (Tavani 2005). (As we will see in Section 4.2.1,\nhowever, citizens in EU countries enjoy much more normative protection\nof their personal data in online contexts than U.S. citizens.)\n\n\nSome forms of personal information enjoy normative protection via\nspecific privacy policies and laws, because they qualify as\ninformation about persons that is considered either sensitive or\nintimate, or both.  We can refer to this kind of personal information\nas Non-Public Personal Information (or NPI). However, many privacy\nanalysts now worry about the ways in which a different kind of\npersonal information\u2014Public Personal Information (or PPI), which\nis non-confidential and non-intimate in character\u2014is easily\ncollected and exchanged over the Internet. How can PPI and NPI be\ndistinguished? NPI, which as noted above, is viewed as information\nabout persons that is essentially confidential or sensitive in nature,\nincludes information about a person\u2019s finances and medical\nhistory. PPI, although also understood as information that is personal\nin nature, is different from NPI in at least one important respect: it\nis neither sensitive nor confidential. For example, information about\nwhere an individual works or attends school, as well as what kind of\nautomobile he or she owns, can be considered personal information in\nthe sense that it is information about some individual as a\nparticular person. However, this kind of personal information\ntypically does not enjoy the same kinds of privacy protection that has\nbeen granted to NPI (Tavani 2016).\n\n\nInitially, concerns about personal information that can be gathered\nand exchanged electronically focused mainly on NPI. In response to\nthese concerns, some specific privacy laws and policies were\nestablished to protect NPI. But many privacy advocates now also worry\nabout the ways in which PPI is routinely collected and analyzed via\ndigital technologies. They have argued that PPI deserves greater legal\nand normative protection than it currently has. Nissenbaum (1997,\n1998) has referred to the challenge that we face with regard to\nprotecting (the kind of information that we refer to as) PPI as the\n\u201cproblem of protecting privacy in public.\u201d Some privacy\nadvocates argue that our earlier assumptions about what kinds of\npublicly available information about us need explicit legal protection\n(or perhaps some kind of less formal \u201cnormative\u201d\nprotection, at the level of policies) are no longer adequate because\nof the way much of that information can now be processed via digital\ntechnologies, especially in the commercial sphere. For example,\nseemingly innocuous information about persons, based on their\nactivities in the public sphere, can be \u201cmined\u201d to create\nuser profiles based on implicit patterns in the data and those\nprofiles (whether accurate or not) can be used to make important\ndecisions affecting people.\n",
