Recall that this says that, for any body of evidence\nand any agenda, there is a unique credence function on that agenda\nthat it is rational for an individual with that total evidence to\nhave. And recall that epistemic permissivism about credences is the\nnegation of this claim. There are three sorts of argument. The first\nappeals to norms of decision theory that encode attitudes to risk to\nanswer questions about which prior credence functions are rationally\npermissible. The second appeals to the notions of probabilistic\nknowledge and epistemic luck. The third appeals to the value of\nrationality.\n5.5.1 Epistemic risk and the Uniqueness Thesis\n\nMinimax (sometimes called Maximin) is the most well-known norm of\ndecision theory that encodes an attitude to risk (Wald 1945). This\nsays that you should pick an option that minimizes your\nworst-case or maximal disutility (equivalently, you should\npick an option that maximizes your worst-case or\nminimal utility). If we say that someone is more risk-averse\nthe more weight they give to worst-case scenarios in their\ndecision-making and the less they give to best-case scenarios, Minimax\nis maximally risk-averse.\n\nPettigrew (2016) proves that, if we assume your agenda is an algebra\nand our epistemic utility function is extensional and strictly proper,\nthen Minimax entails the Principle of Indifference:\n\n\nPrinciple of Indifference Rationality requires that\nyou assign the same credence to every possible state of the world.\n\n\nGiven an agenda, Probabilism and the Principle of Indifference pick\nout a unique prior credence function, namely, the uniform credence\nfunction, \\(c^\\dag\\), where \\(c^\\dag(w) = \\frac{1}{n}\\), for all \\(w\\)\nin \\(\\mathcal{W}\\), and \\(n\\) is the number of worlds in\n\\(\\mathcal{W}\\).\n\nHowever, Minimax is often thought too extreme. It might be rationally\npermissible to be risk-averse, but it is not rationally permissible to\nplace all of your weight on the worst-case scenario and pay\nno attention to anything else: you would surely prefer an\noption that pays \u00a31 if the number of stars is even and\n\u00a31,000,000 if it\u2019s odd to an option that pays \u00a32\neither way, and yet Minimax rules out the first.\n\nAlternative risk-sensitive norms of decision theory have been\nproposed. Pettigrew considers the Hurwicz Criterion (Hurwicz 1952;\nPettigrew 2016) and formulates the Generalized Hurwicz Criterion\n(Pettigrew 2022). In the former, you consider not only the worst-case\nscenario but also the best, and you assign a weight to each to give\nthe Hurwicz score. He shows that, if we are permissive enough about\nthe weightings, we obtain permissivism about rational priors. In the\nlatter, we give weights to all scenarios, best, second-best, and so on\ndown to second-worst, worst; and that gives us the generalized Hurwicz\nscore. Again, if we are permissive enough about weightings, we obtain\nan even broader permissivism about priors. \n5.5.2 Epistemic luck, probabilistic knowledge, and the Uniqueness Thesis\n\nJason Konek (2017) argues for a norm that\u2019s slightly weaker than\nthe Uniqueness Thesis. He appeals not to best and worst cases but to\nbest and worst expectations by the lights of different possible chance\nfunctions. He is not so interested in what they think of the prior you\npick, but what they think of the possible posteriors you might obtain\nfrom the prior when you learn new information. He thinks you should\npick a prior so that the difference between the maximum expected\nepistemic utility of your posterior and the minimum is minimized: he\ncalls this principle MaxSen.\n\nWhy do this? Because, Konek argues, this gives you the best chance of\nforming credences that constitute probabilistic knowledge of the sort\nSarah Moss (2018) has described. One putative necessary condition on\nknowledge is that the success you have forming an accurate belief or\ncredence is due to your own ability, rather than to luck. Konek argues\nthat, if you pick the prior he recommends, whatever accuracy you\nobtain after you learn the new evidence and update accordingly is due\nto your own cognitive ability as much as possible and to luck as\nlittle as possible. The relationship of Konek\u2019s MaxSen to the\n Uniqueness Thesis\n is a bit subtle. For someone with no evidence, a fixed agenda, and a\npartition from which their future evidence will come, there is a\nunique credence function it demands; but which it demands does depend\non the partition from which the future evidence will come, and the\n Uniqueness Thesis\n does not strictly permit that.\n5.5.3 Propriety, epistemic permissivism, and the Uniqueness Thesis\n\nSophie Horowitz (2019) appeals to epistemic utility theory to raise\ntwo problems for epistemic permissivism.\n\nFirst, take a\n strictly proper\n epistemic utility function. Then, Horowitz points out, whichever set\nof prior credence functions the epistemic permissivist takes to be\nrationally permissible, for many of those permissible credence\nfunctions, there will be impermissible ones they expect to have\ngreater epistemic utility than many of the other permissible ones. For\ninstance, perhaps rationality doesn\u2019t require that your prior\ncredence in a proposition is a particular number, but it does require\nthat it lies within a certain range\u2014say, between 0.3 and 0.6.\nThen, if your credence is near one end of this range but still within\nit (say, 0.31), then it is rationally permitted, but it will expect\nsomething a little beyond that end of the range (say, 0.29), which is\nthereby not rationally permitted, to have greater epistemic utility\nthan something within the range, and therefore rationally permitted,\nbut at the other end (say, 0.59).\n\nSecond, Horowitz notes that, if our epistemic utility function is\nstrictly proper, then each permissible credence function expects\nitself to be best. And this causes problems for what Horowitz calls\n\u201cacknowledged permissive cases\u201d. These are cases in which\nrationality is permissive, and moreover the individual knows this is\nso. In such cases, they adopt their particular prior, and they know\nthat this prior is merely one among many rationally permissible\npriors; but, because our epistemic utility function is strictly\nproper, they expect it to have greater epistemic utility than any\nalternative, including the alternatives they take to be rationally\npermissible. So, Horowitz asks, in what sense do they really consider\nthose alternatives permissible? Horowitz considers a response by\nMiriam Schoenfield (2014) and finds it wanting.\n",
