    "main_text": "\n\n\nNumenius, a Platonist philosopher of the mid 2nd century\nCE, had considerable impact on later Platonism, most notably on\nPlotinus (3rd c.) and Porphyry\n(3rd-4th c.  His work survives only in\nfragments, either as excerpts or in reports in later sources, mostly\nPlatonists, both pagan and Christian (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus,\nCalcidius, Origen, Eusebius). Numenius' work is important both\nhistorically and philosophically. Its historical significance lies\nmainly in that it shows how much of Plotinus' philosophy, especially\nPlotinus' metaphysics, was inspired by earlier Platonists such as\nNumenius, who was one of the authors read in Plotinus' seminar\n(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 14.12).  Plotinus' debt to\nNumenius' philosophy was much debated already by Platonists of\nPlotinus' generation (ibid. 18.2\u20133, 17.1\u201323). This\ndiscussion shows that Plotinus was not considered in his own time to\nhave initiated a new and distinct movement in Platonism\u2014what we\ntoday call Neoplatonism. He was rather seen as simply continuing and\ndeveloping the philosophy of previous Platonists, Numenius being\nprominent among them, just as they themselves had developed in similar\nfashion the work of their own Platonist predecessors. Numenius'\nsignificance also lies in his impact on the thought of early Christian\nthinkers like Origen and Eusebius, who are captured by Numenius'\nreferences to Hebrews and see in his theology a prefiguration of their\ntrinitarian doctrine. Philosophically, Numenius' work is important\nbecause he, like Eudorus and Moderatus (1st c. CE), tried\nto construct a hierarchical system of intelligible principles\n(archai) of reality, but unlike them he held that\nintelligible principles are responsible only for the order of the\nworld, wherein its goodness lies, while matter has an existence\nindependent of these principles and accounts for disorder and\nbadness. In this sense Numenius maintains a dualism in metaphysics\nthat has affinities with that of Plutarch. Numenius' system of three\nprinciples of reality, similar to Plotinus' hypostases of One,\nIntellect and Soul, was constructed on the basis of accounts of the\nintelligible world and its primacy, and of the soul as a spiritual\nsubstance essentially related to that world, in Plato. More\nspecifically, it results from reflection on the Form of the Good in\nRepublic VI, the demiurge and the world-soul of the\nTimaeus, and the One of the Parmenides. The\nhierarchical order of these principles of reality is determined by the\ndegree of unity and simplicity of each; the highest principle is the\nsimplest and most completely a unity. It is also absolutely good and transmits goodness.\n",
