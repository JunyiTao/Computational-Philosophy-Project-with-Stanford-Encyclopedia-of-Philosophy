    "main_text": "Justice: Four Distinctions || Procedural versus Substantive Justice\n2.3 Procedural versus Substantive Justice\n\nA third distinction that must be drawn is between the justice of the\nprocedures that might be used to determine how benefits and burdens of\nvarious kinds are allocated to people, and the justice of the final\nallocation itself. It might initially seem as though the justice of a\nprocedure can be reduced to the justice of the results produced by\napplying it, but this is not so. For one thing, there are cases in\nwhich the idea of an independently just outcome makes no sense. A coin\ntoss is a fair way of deciding who starts a game, but neither the\nBlues nor the Reds have a claim of justice to bat first or kick off.\nBut even where a procedure has been shaped by a concern that it should\nproduce substantively just outcomes, it may still have special\nproperties that make it intrinsically just. In that case, using a\ndifferent procedure to produce the same result might be objectionable.\nIn an influential discussion, John Rawls contrasted perfect\nprocedural justice, where a procedure is such that if it is\nfollowed a just outcome is guaranteed (requiring the person who cuts a\ncake to take the last slice himself is the illustration Rawls\nprovides), imperfect procedural justice, where the procedure\nis such that following it is likely, but not certain, to produce the\njust result, and pure procedural justice, such as the\ncoin-tossing example, where there is no independent way to assess the\noutcome \u2013 if we call it just, it is only on the grounds that it\nhas come about by following the relevant procedure (Rawls 1971, 1999,\n\u00a7 14).\n\nTheories of justice can then be distinguished according to the\nrelative weight they attach to procedures and substantive outcomes.\nSome theories are purely procedural in form. Robert Nozick\ndistinguished between historical theories of justice, end-state\ntheories, and patterned theories in order to defend the first against\nthe second and third (Nozick 1974). An end-state theory defines\njustice in terms of some overall property of a distribution (of\nresources, welfare, etc.) \u2013 for example whether it is\negalitarian, or whether the lowest position in the distribution is as\nhigh as it can be, as Rawls\u2019 difference principle requires. A\npatterned theory looks at whether what each receives as part of a\ndistribution matches some individual feature such as their desert or\ntheir need. By contrast, an historical theory asks about the process\nby which the final outcome has arisen. In Nozick\u2019s particular\ncase, a distribution of resources is said to be just if everyone\nwithin its scope is entitled to what they now own, having acquired it\nby legitimate means \u2013 such as voluntary contract or gift \u2013\nfrom someone who was also entitled to have it, leading back eventually\nto a just act of acquisition \u2013 such as labouring on a plot of\nland \u2013 that gave the first owner his valid title. The shape of\nthe final distribution is irrelevant: according to Nozick, justice is\nentirely a matter of the sequence of prior events that created it (for\ncritical assessments of Nozick\u2019s position, see Paul 1982, Wolff\n1991, Cohen 1995, chs. 1\u20132).\n\nFor most philosophers, however, the justice of a procedure is to a\nlarge extent a function of the justice of the outcomes that it tends\nto produce when applied. For instance, the procedures that together\nmake up a fair trial are justified on the grounds that for the most\npart they produce outcomes in which the guilty are punished and the\ninnocent are acquitted. Yet even in these cases, we should be wary of\nassuming that the procedure itself has no independent value. We can\nask of a procedure whether it treats the people to whom it is applied\njustly, for example by giving them adequate opportunities to advance\ntheir claims, not requiring them to provide personal information that\nthey find humiliating to reveal, and so forth. Studies by social\npsychologists have shown that in many cases people care more about\nbeing treated fairly by the institutions they have to deal with than\nabout how they fare when the procedure\u2019s final result is known\n(Lind and Tyler 1988).\n",
