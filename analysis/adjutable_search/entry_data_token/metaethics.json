General Observations\n\nThe range of issues, puzzles and questions that fall within\nmetaethics\u2019 purview are consistently abstract. They reflect the\nfact that metaethics involves an attempt to step back from particular\nsubstantive debates within morality to ask about the views,\nassumptions, and commitments that are shared by those who engage in\nthe debate. By and large, the metaethical issues that emerge as a\nresult of this process of stepping back can be addressed without\ntaking a particular stand on substantive moral issues that started the\nprocess. In fact, metaethics has seemed to many to offer a crucial\nneutral background against which competing moral views need to be seen\nif they are to be assessed properly. Indeed, some metaethicists go so\nfar as to hold that their own work makes no substantive moral\nassumptions at all and has no practical\n implications.[2]\n Whether any view that is recognizably still a view about the nature\nand status of ethics could manage this is dubious. But there is no\ndoubt that, whatever metaethics\u2019s substantive assumptions and\npractical implications might be, it involves reflecting on the\npresuppositions and commitments of those engaging in moral thought,\ntalk, and practice and so abstracting away from particular moral\njudgments.\n\nSuch reflection quickly reveals the extent to which various aspects of\nmorality might reasonably be seen as both intellectually and\npractically problematic. On the intellectual side, many have worried\nthat there is no good way to vindicate the assumptions and commitments\nof morality. A careful and clear-eyed study of morality will reveal,\nsome argue, that it is a myth that there are moral values, duties, or\nresponsibilities; others argue that the various principles that are\npresented as authoritative standards for all are actually merely\nexpressions of emotion or projections of the idiosyncratic attitudes\nof those advocating the principles; still others argue that in some\nother way morality is not what it pretends to be and not what it needs\nto be if it is to be legitimate. On the practical side, many have\npressed the difficulty of getting people to judge themselves and\nothers impartially; others have worried that, while we have an\ninterest in convincing others to conform to morality, we ourselves\nrarely have any reason, really, to conform; still others have thought\nthat the sort of freedom morality assumes is not available to humans\nas they actually are.\n\nOf course these worries and arguments regularly find counterparts on\nthe other side, with people maintaining that, properly understood,\nmorality is no myth, that its pretensions can be vindicated, that we\nhave all the reason we need to embrace morality and meet its demands,\nand that people, at least some people under some circumstances, have\nwhatever sort of freedom it is that morality might require.\n\nNone of the arguments, on either side, can go quickly or easily. They\nall depend, first, on identifying and defending the presuppositions\nand commitments one takes to be at issue and then, second, on showing\nthat those commitments either cannot, or can, be defended. What is at\nstake is, at least, an understanding of what is an important part of\nmost peoples\u2019 lives. Yet there is potentially a lot more at\nstake to the extent the presuppositions and commitments people take\nfor granted turn out to be suspect. For then, not only will our\nunderstanding of moral thought, talk, and practice be\ncompromised, our sense that morality is important may well disappear\nas well.\n\nDespite the abstract and deeply controversial nature of metaethics,\nits central concerns arise naturally\u2014perhaps even\ninevitably\u2014as one reflects critically on one\u2019s own moral\nconvictions. So it is no surprise that, in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, Polemarchus\u2019 off-hand claim that being a just\nperson enhances one\u2019s life developed quickly into a decidedly\nmetaethical discussion of the origin and nature of justice. Early in\nBook I, for instance, Thrasymachus defends the idea that justice is\nwhatever is in the interest of the stronger, arguing that morality is\na human creation designed by the rich and powerful to control and\nexploit others. A myth for the weak-minded, arranged for the advantage\nof a few, justice imposes burdens most have reason to set aside. So\nThrasymachus argues. Glaucon follows up, in Book II, with an\nalternative, and less cynical, proposal. While he too sees morality as\na human creation, he sees it as a salutary solution to the serious\nproblems we would otherwise face. He argues that people naturally find\nthemselves unable successfully to ensure that their own wills will\nrule while, simultaneously, being subject regularly to the will of\nothers. The principles of justice are, he thinks, reasonably\nintroduced and enforced by all as a good way to ensure peace and\nstability in society. Socrates, in contrast, rejects the idea that\njustice is a human invention and argues instead that justice provides\nindependent and eternal standards against which human practices,\nconventions, and institutions can be judged. These different views\nwill likely have implications for what value justice might have. At\nthe same time, though, accepting one or the other view of the nature\nof justice is compatible with a range of substantive views about what,\nspecifically, justice consists in and about its value. On the one\nhand, one might see justice as a social convention while still holding\nthat the relevant conventions are in place whenever they are enforced\nby the powerful or that only mutually advantageous conventions\nestablish justice. On the other hand, one might see justice as\ntranscending human invention and conventions entirely and yet hold\nthat they either demand treating others with respect or with promoting\ntheir happiness.\n2. The Euthyphro Problem\n\nAccording to many, Socrates\u2019s position fits well with\nmorality\u2019s pretensions. It fits well also with the thought that\nwhatever standards humans might put in place are, one and all, liable\nto moral criticism. Of course, Socrates\u2019s position brings along\na suite of puzzles concerning the nature of these transcendent\nstandards. What is their origin and from where do they derive their\nauthority?\n\nMany have thought the right answers to these questions are found in an\nappeal to God. On their view, moral principles are the expression of\nGod\u2019s will\u2014they are His commands to us\u2014and they get\ntheir authority from their source. In important ways, though, this\nmerely shifts the puzzles back a step. Whatever problems one might\nhave making sense of eternal transcendent standards re-emerge when\ntrying to make sense of an eternal transcendent being who might issue\ncommands. And, as Plato emphasized in Euthyphro, one is also\nleft with the difficulty of explaining why God\u2019s commands are\nauthoritative.\n\nOne plausible answer might be that God\u2019s perfect knowledge of\nright and wrong, or God\u2019s own moral perfection, explains why his\ncommands serve legitimately as standards for us. But that answer\nassumes that standards of morality exist independently of God\u2019s\nwill (either as objects of his knowledge or as standards in light of\nwhich He counts as morally perfect), in which case speaking of\nmorality as consisting of God\u2019s commands will not explain the\norigin or nature of these independently existing standards.\n\nAlternatively, one might eschew an appeal to God\u2019s knowledge or\ngoodness and claim that there is no independent standard for\nGod\u2019s will and nature. But that leaves in place the puzzle\nconcerning the authority of moral principles. If we reject the idea\nthat God\u2019s commands reflect His knowledge of right and wrong,\nand reject the idea that there is an independent standard for\nGod\u2019s will and nature (in light of which we recognize Him as all\ngood), it seems reasonable to wonder why his commands have any special\n authority.[3]\n\nOne might here point to God\u2019s power to punish or to His role in\nour creation. But neither consideration seems to establish legitimate\nauthority on its own. In general, at least, the mere fact that one has\nthe power to enforce one\u2019s commands does not establish those\ncommands as legitimate, nor does it ensure that one has a right to\npunish those who fail to conform to one\u2019s commands. Similarly,\nin general, the mere fact that one created something does not\nestablish that one properly has absolute control over what one has\ncreated. Of course, room remains to argue that there is something\nspecial about God\u2019s power, or about His role as creator, that\nmakes his commands distinctively legitimate. What is needed is an\naccount of what is special. And, in this context, it needs to be an\naccount that explains how God\u2019s commands, as opposed to the\ncommands that others might issue, have an authority. Moreover, if\nappealing to God is to solve the metaethical puzzle posed by\nEuthyphro, the account offered must not itself rely on, or presuppose,\nthe sort of transcendent standards we have been attempting to\nexplain.\n3. Naturalism and Non-naturalism\n\nOne appealing feature of Glaucon\u2019s account of morality as a\nmutually advantageous convention is that it renders morality\u2019s\norigin and nature non-mysterious. Moral facts, on this sort of view,\nemerge as no more puzzling than facts about what is legal or polite.\nIn each case, the standing of some behavior (as moral, or legal, or\npolite) depends on its conforming to, or conflicting with, various\nstandards that have been put in place. Glaucon\u2019s account also\nmakes clear why it is that people might care deeply about\nmorality\u2019s demands (even as they are, in their own cases,\ntempted to violate them when they believe they can with impunity),\nsince the relevant conventions are mutually advantageous.\n\nYet conventionalist views such as Glaucon\u2019s have real\ndifficulties fitting with the common idea that the fundamental\nprinciples of morality are universal. Conventions, after all, are\ncontingent creations that differ from place to place and come in to,\nand go out of, existence. Moreover, conventions seem liable to\narbitrariness in ways that threaten to undermine their claim to\nauthority unless they are recognized (at least implicitly) as\nsatisfying some convention-independent standard. That some convention\ndemands something seems to provide reason to conform to the demand\nonly when the convention is, itself, just or reasonable, or in some\nother way good. And this suggests that, to whatever extent specific\nmoral rules and principles are products of convention, their claim to\nauthority relies on some standards that are not products of\nconvention.\n\nNeedless to say, these considerations are not decisive, and those who\nsee morality as a kind of convention have a variety of plausible ways\nto address the worries mentioned above. As a result, the view remains\nattractive. Still, many\u2014even many who think an appeal to\nconvention is essential to making sense of morality\u2014think that\nthe proper account of morality cannot be a matter of conventions\n\u201call the way\n down\u201d.[4]\n But that does not mean that they think that the standards that serve\nto justify the demands of (some) conventions are mysterious. Some, for\ninstance, argue that what makes a convention good, and so serves to\njustify its demands, is its contribution to overall happiness, while\nothers see the measure of conventions in their ability to advance the\ninterests of each considered singly, and still others maintain that\nthe value of conventions is found in their capacity to secure the\napproval of those who consider them impartially. On all such accounts,\nvalue is convention-independent, but it is nonetheless metaphysically\nnon-mysterious. Each of these accounts portrays value as, at bottom, a\nfamiliar, completely natural, feature of the world. Moreover, while\n(on these accounts) particular claims concerning value will prove hard\nto establish and controversial, there is no special puzzle about what\nwe would be trying to discover or what would count as relevant\nevidence.\n\nThese are all examples of naturalist accounts of morality that\nidentify various moral properties with non-problematic natural\nfeatures of the world. As a result, they are commonly characterized as\nversions of naturalism and are contrasted with non-naturalist views\nthat see morality as presupposing, or being committed to, properties\nover and above those that would be countenanced by natural\nscience.\n\nNon-naturalism comes with two distinctive burdens: (i) accounting for\nhow the realm of moral properties fits in with familiar natural\nproperties and (ii) explaining how it is that we are able to learn\nanything about these moral properties. Naturalism, in contrast, avoids\nthese metaphysical and epistemological burdens.\n\nDespite its advantages, naturalism has difficulty capturing well what\npeople take to be the true nature of morality. In saying something is\ngood or right or virtuous we seem to be saying something more than, or\nat least different from, what we would be saying in describing it as\nhaving certain natural features. Correspondingly, no amount of\nempirical investigation seems by itself, without some moral\nassumption(s) in play, sufficient to settle a moral question. (See the\nentries on\n moral realism;\n moral non-naturalism;\n moral naturalism;\n moral relativism; and\n supervenience in ethics.)\n4. Is/Ought and the Open Question Argument\n\nDavid Hume seemed to have these points in mind when he observed that\nan \u2018ought\u2019 cannot be derived from an\n \u2018is.\u2019[5]\n There is substantial debate about just what Hume meant, and similarly\nsubstantial debate as well about whether he was right. But at least\npart of Hume\u2019s concern seems to have been that no set of claims\nabout plain matters of fact (\u2018is\u2019 claims) entail any\nevaluative claims (\u2018ought\u2019 claims). He seems to have\nthought that one can infer the latter from the former only if, in\naddition to premises concerning plain matters of fact, one has on hand\nas well at least one evaluative premise. If, for instance, one infers\nfrom the fact that someone is feeling pain that something bad is\nhappening, one is at least presupposing that pain is bad. That\npresupposition, in turn, is not entailed by any claims concerned\nsolely with plain matters of fact. If Hume is right, every valid\nargument for an evaluative conclusion either includes or presupposes\nsome evaluative premise. And, as a result, there is no value-neutral\nargument for an evaluative conclusion.\n\nComing at the same issues from a different direction, G. E. Moore\nargued (at the beginning of the twentieth century) that no naturalist\naccount of morality could do justice to what we are actually thinking\nand claiming when we make moral\n judgments.[6]\n Moore had in mind a variety of naturalist views that, at the time,\nhad come to be seen as, on balance, the most attractive accounts of\nthe nature of morality. While these views differed among themselves as\nto what goodness, rightness, virtue, and justice might consist in,\nthey shared a commitment to seeing morality as a wholly natural\nphenomenon and they all saw moral judgment as a matter of thinking\nthat actions, institutions, or characters had some particular natural\nproperty or other. According to these views, moral properties are to\nbe identified with some natural property or other (e.g., with what is\npleasant, or what satisfies someone\u2019s desire, or what conforms\nto social rules that are in force).\n\nConsidering specifically views that identified goodness either with\npleasure or with being the object of a desire one desires to have,\nMoore maintained that such views confused the property goodness with\nsome other property that good things might happen to have. In support\nof his claim, Moore offered a simple test. Take whichever account you\nwill\u2014say, one according to which to be good is to be\npleasant\u2014and then consider whether a person who understands the\nterms involved might nonetheless intelligibly ask whether something\nshe acknowledges to be pleasant is good. It seems she could. And it\nseems too that in asking the question she would not then be revealing\nany kind of conceptual confusion or incompetence. The question is, as\nMoore put it, a genuinely open one. But then we must grant that to\nthink something is pleasant is not identical to thinking it is good.\nOtherwise, wondering whether something that is, admittedly, pleasant,\nis good would be as senseless as wondering whether a given pleasant\nthing was pleasant. If, though, to think something good is different\nthan thinking it pleasant, such thoughts (Moore assumed) must involve\nattributing distinct properties.\n\nMoore was quick to point out that granting that the question is open,\nin the sense his argument supposes, is compatible with discovering\nthat, as a matter of fact, everything that is pleasant is also good.\nMoore\u2019s point is that the question is not settled\u2014not\nclosed\u2014on conceptual grounds (whereas it would be if thinking\nsomething good were just a matter of thinking it pleasant). Because\nanalogous questions remain open for all the candidate naturalist\nproposals, Moore argued that no such proposal could legitimately be\ndefended as a conceptual truth and that they all failed to capture\naccurately what we are thinking in thinking of something that it is\ngood.\n\nMoore\u2019s argument had a tremendous impact, striking most people\nat the time as decisive. As a result, non-naturalism got a new lease\non life with a number of people working in metaethics trying to\narticulate, systematize, and defend accounts of morality that resisted\nthe temptation to identify moral properties with natural\n properties.[7]\n Much of the attention was given, by those who have come to be called\nintuitionists, to defending the idea that moral knowledge, while not\nbased on our senses and on the empirical data we might collect, was\nnonetheless on as secure a footing as, say, our knowledge of\nmathematics or of the fundamental concepts (of, say, causation and\nnecessity) that play crucial roles in science. Much of the work in\nmetaethics pursued a strategy of finding companions in guilt, of\nshowing that the status of moral properties as non-natural and the\nattendant implications for what we must suppose about the nature of\nmoral evidence, did not leave morality any worse off than other\nrespected fields of knowledge.\n\nYet Moore\u2019s casual slide from claims about what we are thinking\nto the nature of the properties we are attributing in thinking as we\ndo, offered an important point of resistance. As Moore saw things, to\nmake a moral claim is to express a distinctive belief (that might be\ntrue or false) about how things are. Specifically, it is to express\nthe belief that some course of action, or institution, or character\ntrait had the property of being right, or good, or virtuous. The\nchallenge (Moore assumed) is to figure out what property it is that we\nare taking a thing to have, in thinking of it as right, or good, or\nvirtuous. And the place to look, he thought, is at the content of our\nbeliefs.\n\nAccording to many, while Moore\u2019s Open Question argument does\nshow that moral thinking is distinctive and should not be treated as\npart and parcel of thinking about non-moral matters, Moore was wrong\nin holding that the important difference should be traced to the\nnature of the properties we are taking things to have. According to\nsome of these critics, Moore\u2019s mistake is in thinking we are\nattributing properties at all, when we think of something as right, or\ngood, or virtuous; according to others, his mistake was in thinking\nthat how we think of a property reveals the true nature of the\n property.[8]\n\nThe first line of criticism emerged soon after Moore first offered his\nOpen Question Argument, with philosophers suggesting that in thinking\nmorally we may well not be attributing properties at\n all.[9]\n Agreeing that it was a mistake to see moral claims as attributing\nnatural properties to things, non-cognitivists argue that\nMoore\u2019s mistake was in thinking that moral claims attribute any\nsort of property to things, and so he was also wrong in thinking that\nmoral claims have propositional content and express genuine beliefs.\nThe Open Question is always open, they argue, not because we are, in\nmaking a moral judgment, attributing some non-natural property to\nthings, but because we are not attributing any property at all. We are\nnot saying anything that might be true or false, nor are we expressing\na belief. We are doing something altogether different: taking a stand,\nor expressing an emotion, or prescribing something. On these views,\nmoral judgments express some attitude other than belief and lack the\nsort of cognitive content that would allow them to be true or\nfalse.\n\nFrom the start, non-cognitivists have had an eye on both (i) the\nnon-cognitive attitudes that are expressed in making a moral\nclaim and (ii) what people are doing in making such claims.\nWhen focusing on the first, they emphasize that moral terms get their\nmeaning not by their link to beliefs that represent the world as being\na certain way, but by their connection to non-cognitive\nattitudes\u2014e.g., reactions to the way the world is, or desires\nfor how the world might be. Here, in giving an account of the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of moral terms, non-cognitivists focus on the\nconventionally-established connection between moral terms and certain\nattitudes. (Of course, people can use such a term without actually\nhaving the corresponding attitudes, but understanding the term,\nnon-cognitivists argue, is a matter of seeing that it is a\nlinguistically appropriate way to express the attitude.) When focusing\non the second, non-cognitivists emphasize moral language\u2019s role\nas tool for influencing others. Here their attention is on how moral\nclaims guide actions. In saying that something is, say, wrong, people\nare consistently not just expressing their opposition to it but\ntelling others not to do it, or working to persuade them not to, or in\nsome other way working to direct action. The two ideas go together\nnaturally, since if the first is right, then it would help explain why\npeople can and do use moral language in the way the second suggests.\nBut the ideas are separable. And many think that the expressivist idea\nadvanced by the first goes to the heart of the matter, while\nconcentrating on the directive or prescriptive use of moral\nlanguage can at best be secondary.\n\nWhatever the details, the non-cognitivists share the idea that one can\nadmit that something is pleasant, or the object of a desire, or such\nthat it conforms to some rule in force, and nonetheless not take a\nstand regarding it, or not have any particular emotion concerning it,\nor not have any interest in prescribing anything relating to it. The\nOpen Question is open, they hold, precisely because the attitudes\nexpressed by a moral judgment all involve something other than merely\nbelieving of something that it has certain features (whether natural\nor not). At the same time, the non-cognitivists\u2019 proposals fit\nwell with granting Hume\u2019s claim concerning the gap between\n\u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019: whatever facts one grants,\nwhatever \u2018is\u2019 claims one endorses, there is no logical\ninconsistency involved in failing to take a relevant stand, or to\nexpress an emotion towards it, or to prescribe something related to\nit. Between the beliefs we might have and the other attitudes we might\nform, no entailment relations hold at all.\n\nNon-cognitivists, of course, need to explain why it seems so plausible\nto see moral judgment as an expression of belief and as a matter of\nattributing properties to actions, institutions, and characters. And\nthey need to explain why moral thought seems appropriately subject to\nthe rules of logic, whereas the various attitudes that play central\nroles in the non-cognitivist accounts all seem to fall outside of that\n realm.[10]\n Taking the challenge head-on, recent versions of expressivism, flying\nthe banner of \u201cquasi-realism\u201d, have taken as a central\nproject explaining, on non-cognitivist foundations, how and why moral\nlanguage has all the trappings of being cognitivist and realist. These\nviews start with a picture of the world as having neither moral\nproperties nor people believing in moral properties (though they have\nother beliefs), and then explain how a practice of thinking and\ntalking about moral properties, moral beliefs, moral truth, and moral\nfacts, might naturally and properly emerge. The central idea\nis that we can see our thought and talk as fundamentally a matter of\nour expressing our affective attitudes or commitments which gives rise\nto legitimate thought and talk about corresponding properties,\nbeliefs, truths, and facts. Two moves underwrite this idea. One is to\nhold that talk of properties, beliefs, truths, and facts comes cheap:\nOnce one holds sincerely that \u201cLying is wrong\u201d, no\nadditional commitments come with adding \u201cLying has the property\nof being wrong\u201d or \u201cI believe that lying is wrong\u201d\nor \u201cIt is true that lying is wrong\u201d or that \u201cIt is a\nfact that lying is wrong\u201d. These are all, in effect, just\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing. And if, in the first place,\nsincerely saying \u201cLying is wrong\u201d is a matter of\nexpressing an attitude or a commitment then so too are these\nalternative ways of saying the same thing. The second move that\nunderwrites quasi-realism is pointing out that the question of whether\nrealist-sounding moral discourse is legitimate is, itself, an\nevaluative question judged in light of one\u2019s attitudes and\ncommitments. There is, on this view, no independent standard of, say,\n\u201cmatching the world\u201d that one can deploy without, in\nchoosing that standard, expressing one\u2019s attitudes and\ncommitments.\n\nVarious versions of non-cognitivism, and in particular versions of\nquasi-realist expressivism, remain among the most attractive ways of\nresisting the non-naturalist implications of Moore\u2019s Open\nQuestion\n Argument.[11]\n But they are not the only option. Many argue that, while\nMoore\u2019s argument shows that thinking something is good\nis different than thinking it is pleasant (or the object of a\ndesire, or such as to conform to some norm that is in force), it does\nnot show that being good is different from being\npleasant (or the object of a desire, or such as to conform to\nsome norm that is in force). After all, they point out, thinking\nthat some liquid is H2O is different from thinking\nit is water and one might intelligibly wonder whether what one\ngrants to be water really is H2O. Yet that does not show\nthat being water is anything other than being\nH20. Far from it. A difference between the thoughts\ndoes not establish a difference in the properties. Thus, for all the\nOpen Question Argument shows, it might turn out that a naturalist\naccount of the nature of moral properties is correct. The naturalist\naccount cannot be defended simply as a conceptual truth but it also\ncannot be rejected, as Moore thought it could be, as obviously\nconfusing one property (the natural property) for another one (the\nmoral property). This sort of cognitivism has no trouble explaining\nwhy it seems so plausible to see moral judgment as an expression of\nbelief and as a matter of attributing properties to actions,\ninstitutions, and characters. Moral judgments are in fact, on this\nsort of account, the expression of belief and they do involve\nattributing properties to actions, institutions, and characters\n(though the account holds that the true nature of the property being\nattributed is something that might come as a surprise to some).\nSimilarly, this sort of cognitivism can explain why moral thought\nseems appropriately subject to the rules of logic: it seems\nappropriately subject to these rules because it is. Problems emerge,\nhowever, when it comes to explaining the apparently distinctive nature\nof moral thinking. If thinking that something is good or right is a\nmatter of attributing to the thing some natural property or other,\nthen what explains the apparently distinctive nature of moral\nthought?\n\nCognitivists and non-cognitivists face a common challenge: to account\nfor the nature of moral thought and talk that simultaneously does\njustice to its distinctive nature without failing to appreciate the\nsignificant ways in which it is continuous with non-moral thought and\ntalk. Cognitivism has a relatively easy time accommodating the\ncontinuity between moral and non-moral thought and talk, but,\nespecially when combined with naturalism, it faces a real challenge in\nmarking the distinctive nature of moral thought and talk;\nnon-cognitivism has no trouble making room for the distinctive nature\nof moral thought and talk, but it has trouble accommodating the\ncontinuity. (See the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.)\n\nWhat has always been attractive about Moorean non-naturalism is its\ncapacity to combine the continuity and the difference into a coherent\npicture. There is room, at least, to account for moral thought\u2019s\ncontinuity with other thought by emphasizing that it is all a matter\nof attributing properties (albeit different properties) to things; and\nthere is room too for locating the distinctive nature of moral thought\nin the putatively authoritative standing of the properties attributed.\nOf course, leaving room for an account is not the same as actually\nproviding one, and Moore himself does not actually offer much at all\nby way of an explanation of the normative authority (as we might call\nit) of moral properties. In any case, what has always been troubling\nabout Moore\u2019s view is that the coherent picture that emerges\nseems to presuppose (i) the existence of metaphysically dubious\nproperties that fall outside the causal nexus and, so, are such that\n(ii) it would be a complete mystery how we could ever reliably learn\nanything about them, if they were to exist. Moore, and the\nintuitionists who followed him, work in various ways to address these\nconcerns. Error theorists, in contrast, hold that the coherent picture\npainted by Moore is, at least roughly, the right account of what moral\nthought and talk involves, but they go on to argue that the\nmetaphysically and epistemically troubling implications of that\npicture properly undermine its credibility. They argue that we have\ncompelling reasons to reject moral thought, at least to the extent\nMoore was right about what moral thought\n presupposes.[12]\n That is of course compatible with thinking that we should use the\nsame language meaning something different by it, or replacing it\naltogether with some other way of thinking and speaking.\n\nThe error theorists\u2019 position regarding morality is the\ncounterpart, with respect to moral thought, of the atheist\u2019s\nposition with respect to views concerning God\u2019s will and ways.\nIn both cases, the suggestion is that the thoughts at issue involve a\nmistake or a failed presupposition, and that, because of this, they\ncannot be true. The error theorist\u2019s position, it is worth\nnoting, requires establishing two claims that have each met a lot of\nresistance: that moral thought really has the presuppositions the\nerror theorist supposes and that those presuppositions are as\nuntenable as the error theorist maintains. At the same time, though,\nanyone who hopes to vindicate moral thought has the burden of showing\nthat its actual presuppositions and implications are, after all,\ndefensible. (See the entry for\n moral anti-realism.)\n5. Moral Epistemology\n\nAnyone mounting such a defense needs to offer some account of how it\nis we might successfully justify one set of moral judgments as over\nagainst others. When we turn to morality, what counts as good grounds\nfor holding one view rather than another? What sort of evidence might\nbe available? If Hume and Moore are right, no evidence that appeals\nsolely to non-evaluative considerations will be sufficient (unless we\npresuppose some principle of inference that connects non-moral\npremises to moral conclusions). But if we need to rely on evaluative\npremises or principles in order to infer substantive moral conclusions\nfrom non-moral premises (e.g., non-moral premises regarding the impact\nof a course of action on pleasure or on the satisfaction of human\ninterests), the question immediately arises, \u201cHow might we\njustify these evaluative premises or principles?\u201d\n\nOne answer often offered is that, at a suitably abstract level, there\nare premises or principles that everyone in fact accepts. Perhaps\n\u2018Murder is wrong\u2019, or \u2018pain is bad\u2019, or\n\u2018everyone should be treated equally\u2019, are candidates. But\nclearly such claims hardly do much work since questions immediately\narise about which killings constitute murder and about how different\npains should be compared and about which way of treating people counts\nas treating them equally in the relevant way. No moral claim that is\nplausibly offered as actually accepted by all, or nearly all, people\ncan possibly be substantive enough to help settle on one set of moral\njudgments rather than another as better justified.\n\nOne might, in light of this, offer a more substantive principle, not\nas one that people actually all accept, but as one that they are all,\nin fact, committed to (though they may not realize it). This strategy\noffers the prospect of identifying a principle rich enough in content\nto serve as the justifying ground for other moral judgments. Yet it\nrequires showing how the principle(s) identified work to justify the\nmore specific judgments they are meant to support. Moreover, one who\ntakes this approach needs also to justify the claim that people are\nactually committed to the principle in the first place. And this\nraises the suspicion that claiming there are certain principles to\nwhich everyone is committed simply relocates the original challenge,\nwithout actually meeting it.\n\nIn any case, even if there are suitably substantive principles to\nwhich people are committed, and this can be shown, and even if there\nis a way to establish as well that the principles in question would\n(if right) actually justify more specific moral judgments, one might\nunderstandably worry about the status of the resulting structure. Why\nnot think of it as a castle in the sky, a structure with no\nappropriate foundation? After all, the fact that we happen to accept,\nor are committed to accepting, some principle, seems a long way from\nshowing that the principle is true or right.\n\nOur moral judgments (about particular cases as well as about general\nprinciples) seem to float disconcertingly free from our normal sources\nof evidence concerning the nature of the world. We cannot see, touch,\ntaste, or smell value or rightness or virtue, even as we can see,\ntouch, taste, or smell some of the things that have value or that are\nright or that manifest virtue. So how do we learn about value and\nrightness and virtue themselves? What grounds do we have for thinking\nour various moral judgments link up appropriately with what they are\njudgments of?\n\nOf course, moral judgments are not the only judgments that face such a\nchallenge. Many mathematical, modal, and religious judgments face a\nsimilar challenge. They all apparently concern matters that are not\ndirectly available to the senses and that are, in various ways,\nmysterious. That establishes some companions in guilt, but also\nprovides the hope that reasonable accounts of how we might learn (or\nnot) about numbers, possibility and necessity, and God, might provide\ninsight into the evidence (if any) we are able to secure concerning\nmorality.\n\nOne approach is to argue, as Kant (1785) does, that the relevant moral\ncommitments, although neither immediately obvious nor universally\nacknowledged, can be known a\n priori.[13]\n On his account, the concept of a rational agent contains within it\nthe resources to ground the unconditional demands, on such agents,\nthat they (i) act always either to take the necessary means to their\nends or abandon (or adjust) those ends and (ii) act always to treat\nthemselves and others as ends and never solely as means. The first, on\nKant\u2019s account, structures practical rationality generally, the\nsecond structures morality specifically. Both are, as Kant sees it,\ninescapable demands on rational agents.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that positive theories of moral epistemology\nare inevitably bound up with accounts of the nature of moral judgment\nand their metaphysical presuppositions and commitments. On some\naccounts, there is nothing to know, so there is no need for a theory\nof moral knowledge. On others, a proper understanding of moral\njudgments will reveal that justifying them is of a piece with\njustifying other judgments for which we have, or hope to have, a\nplausible epistemology, so the epistemology of morality will be\ncontinuous with epistemological theories of other domains (see McGrath\n2020). On still other accounts, moral judgments are such that only a\nsui generis epistemology would make sense of our capacity to\nacquire moral knowledge. No matter which of these options one takes,\nepistemological skepticism looms as a threat. And in the first case,\nwhere there is by implication nothing to know, it does not merely\nloom, it arrives inevitably. Even if one succeeds in developing a\npositive theory of moral epistemology in light of which moral\nknowledge might be possible, the substantive challenge of showing that\nknowledge has actually been secured remains formidable.\n\nMoreover, the deep and apparently irresolvable moral disagreements,\neven among those who in other respects regard each other as peers,\ncalls into question the idea that people are even justified in holding\nthe views they do. After all, if someone equally informed, smart,\nconcerned, and sensitive know that they arrive at different moral\nconclusions, how can either regard themselves as justified in their\nopinion. On what grounds? Thanks to what evidence? (See the entry on\n disagreement.)\n\nOne way to respond to this worry is to maintain that apparent peers\nactually are not peers either because they lack relevant evidence, or\nthey suffer from distorting evidence, or they fail, at least when it\ncomes to moral matters, to give the proper weight to their evidence in\ntheir reasoning. Taking this line commits one to some view or other of\nwhat evidence is the relevant evidence and what is involved in giving\nit the proper weight in moral reasoning. Not surprisingly, there is a\nhuge variety of views on these matters concerning, for instance,\nwhether one\u2019s moral judgments are justified only if they have\ntheir foundation in, say, distinctive set of moral intuitions (see\nMoore 1903; Ross 1930; Huemer 2005); or only if one\u2019s moral\njudgments cohere properly with one another, with one\u2019s\nprinciples connecting and supporting one\u2019s more particular moral\njudgments (see Rawls 1971; Daniels 1979; Sayre-McCord 1996); or only\nif they can be grounded in an inescapable aspect of rational agency\n(Korsgaard 1996).)\n\nAny moral epistemology is likely to inherit virtually all the\ncomplexity that comes with epistemology in general, including not just\nthe challenge of disagreement among peers, and the debate between\nfoundationalists and coherentists about justification, but worries\nabout our access to the relevant truths (if such there be), and the\npersistent looming threat of skepticism (see Enoch 2011;\nSinnott-Armstrong 2006). When that is added to the apparently\ndistinctive nature of moral thought, the challenges are daunting. (See\nthe entries on\n moral epistemology\n and\n moral skepticism.)\n\nAt the same time, much of morality seems clearly a matter of knowing\nhow\u2014how to respond to the need of others, how to\nrespond to threats, how to carry oneself in various\nsituations\u2014and not primarily (if at all) a matter of knowing\nthat something is the case. No doubt, focusing on knowing\nhow, rather than knowing that, does not address skepticism concerning\nthe claims we might make as to which know-how is morally significant.\nBut paying attention to the degree to which people count as moral (or\nimmoral) not because of what they say or believe, but because of how\nthey act, is important to appreciating both the nature of morality and\nwhat all a plausible account of moral knowledge must encompass.\n6. Morals, Motives, and Reasons\n\nAmong morality\u2019s distinctive features, all agree, is its\napparently intimate connection to action. In making moral judgments,\nfor instance, we seem to be making a claim that, if true, establishes\nthat someone or other has a reason to act or be a certain way. This\nmarks an important difference between moral claims and claims\nconcerning, say, color. The claim that something is red is, even if\ntrue, only contingently connected to whether anyone has any reason at\nall to act or be a certain way. Whereas if a certain thing is morally\ngood it seems that everyone necessarily has at least some reason\n(perhaps overridable or defeasible, but still some reason) to promote,\npursue, protect, or respect it\u2014at least if they recognize that\nit is good. Moreover, many have thought, to judge sincerely that\nsomething is good (whether or not one is right) is to have some\nmotivation (again, perhaps overridable or defeasible, but still some\nmotivation) to promote, pursue, protect, or respect it.\n\nThus there seem to be necessary connections between moral properties\nand reasons and also between moral judgments and motivations. Some\nhave thought as well that there is a necessary connection between\nmoral judgments and reasons, such that if one judges that something is\ngood or right then (whether one is correct or not) one had a reason to\nact or be a certain way. Others have thought that there is a\nconnection, again, a necessary connection, between there being a\nreason for someone to act or be a certain way and that person being,\nor at least being able to be, motivated in a certain\n way.[14]\n This last suggestion, that (say) one can have reason to do only what\none might be motivated to do, has implications as well for what might\ncount as good, if something is good only if one has a reason to act in\na certain way with respect to\n it.[15]\n\nEach of these supposed necessary connections is controversial and yet\neach has plausibly been taken to be at the heart of what is\ndistinctive about\n morality.[16]\n At the same time, different proposed connections fit more or less\nwell with different accounts of morality and at least some of the\nsupposed connections are flat out incompatible with some of the\naccounts. Thus those versions of non-cognitivism that see making a\nmoral judgment as a matter of expressing some motivating attitude have\nan easier time explaining the internal connection (if there is one)\nbetween sincerely making a moral judgment and having an appropriate\nmotive, while certain naturalist cognitivist proposals, for instance\nthose that identify goodness with having the capacity to garner\napproval from someone who is fully informed, must hold that a person\nmight sincerely judge that something would secure that approval and\nyet be utterly unmotivated by that\n fact.[17]\n (See the entries on\n moral motivation\n and\n reasons for action: internal vs external.)\n\nWorking through the ways in which a proper appreciation of the\nrelations between morality, reasons, and motivation constrain and\ninform an account of morality has been a central issue in metaethics.\nIn fact, Glaucon\u2019s original proposal concerning the nature of\nmorality (according to which morality is a conventional solution to\nproblems we would otherwise have to face) was introduced as a way of\npressing a worry about morality: Morality pretends to provide reason\nto all, virtue is supposed to be its own reward, and a person is told\nshe should do the right thing because it is right and not because she\nhopes for some reward, yet, in the face of the demands morality\nsometimes makes, these claims concerning its nature and value all seem\ndubious. Specifically, if morality is (as Glaucon\u2019s proposal\nwould have it) constituted solely by a set of conventional rules we\nput in place to secure the benefits we receive from the restraint of\nothers, it looks as if the only reason (and the only motive) we would\neach have for conforming to the rules would be found in the\nconsequences we hope such compliance would secure. In cases where we\ncould get the benefits without the restraint (as when our failure to\nrestrain ourselves would be undetected) we would have neither reason\nnor motive not to violate the rules. Thus, if Glaucon is right about\nthe nature of morality, then morality (properly understood) would only\nprovide reason to some, under some circumstances, not reason to all,\nalways. Moreover, virtue would not be its own reward. And morality\nwould not be such that it would make sense for a person to do the\nright thing (as defined by the rules in place) for its own sake, since\nthe sole value of the relevant rules is found in the benefits that\ncome from others complying with those rules.\n\nGlaucon\u2019s ultimate hope was Socrates would provide an account of\nmorality that\u2014unlike his own\u2014would serve to vindicate\nmorality\u2019s pretensions. Glaucon assumed that if no such account\nis forthcoming morality\u2019s claim on our allegiance is undermined,\neven as we might continue to have our own reasons for perpetuating the\nmyth and for working to see that others comply with its rules. Much of\nthe Republic is then given over to Socrates\u2019 first,\ndeveloping an account of the nature of morality (specifically, of\njustice) and then, second, arguing that being moral is valuable\nregardless of the consequences. Socrates\u2019 concern, in showing\nthat being moral is valuable, is to show specifically that it is\nvaluable to the person who is moral, that the virtuous person, and not\njust others, benefits from her virtue. Indeed, he tries to show that\nbeing moral is so valuable to the person who is moral, that whatever\nthe consequences of injustice might be, however great the rewards,\nthey could never be valuable enough to outweigh the loss of\none\u2019s virtue.\n\nSocrates\u2019 own account of the metaphysical and epistemological\nunderpinnings of his view (his appeal to eternal, non-physical\nPlatonic Forms and to our intellectual access to those Forms) commits\nhim unmistakably to non-naturalism and to something like intuitionism.\nYet his account of the nature of justice (as a matter of people\nsuccessfully being ruled by reason) and the specific features of\njustice that he takes to establish its value (specifically its\nconnection to freedom), are as available to a naturalist as to a\nnon-naturalist (as long as reason and freedom can be understood\nnaturalistically).\n\nIn any case, the question underlying Glaucon\u2019s concern\nis\u2014Why should I be moral?\u2014has consistently been at the\ncenter of attempts to explain the connection between morality and what\nwe have reason to\n do.[18]\n Some have argued that the question is misplaced, at least if it\nassumes there must be some non-moral reason to be moral. Others have\nheld that the question is easily answered on the grounds that the fact\nthat some action is morally required, for instance, entails that one\nhas reason to do it. And still others have maintained that the\nquestion presses the single most important challenge to\nmorality\u2019s legitimacy, since morality\u2019s claim on our\nallegiance depends on our having reason to comply with its demands,\nyet explaining why we might have those reasons is extraordinarily\ndifficult.\n\nWhatever view one ends up adopting concerning the connections that\nhold (or do not hold) among moral properties, moral judgments, reasons\nfor action, and effective motivations, no account is plausible as a\nvindication of morality unless it makes sense of how and why moral\nconsiderations might properly figure in practical deliberation that\nresults in decision and action. Doing this successfully is, in\nprinciple, compatible with thinking moral properties do not always\nprovide reasons, compatible too with holding that moral judgments\nsometimes fail to motivate, and, finally, compatible as well with the\nidea that one might have a reason to perform some action that one has\nno motivation to perform. Of course, these various views are each\nquite controversial and involve rejecting what others have thought to\nbe necessary truths.\n7. Freedom and Responsibility\n\nMaking sense of how moral considerations might figure in practical\ndeliberation is especially important when it comes to explaining when\nand why people are responsible for what they do or fail to do. Some of\nthat explanatory job is a matter of moral theory, not metaethics, and\ninvolves figuring out what counts as good excuses, legitimate\njustifications, and appropriate burdens. A theory of moral\nresponsibility inevitably relies on substantive moral theory.\n\nYet there are important metaethical issues bound up in giving an\naccount of moral responsibility. They emerge most sharply as one\nconsiders the nature and significance of free will. Does\nresponsibility presuppose free will? If so, when does someone count as\nhaving a free will? It cannot merely be a matter of her will being\nuncaused. After all, a person whose will was utterly random,\nresponsive neither to her nor to the reasons she had for doing things,\nwould be a person no freer (in the relevant sense) than a person whose\nwill was fully and directly controlled by someone else as a puppeteer\nmight control a puppet. What would it take for her will to count as\nappropriately responsive, either to her or to her reasons? Is this\nappropriate responsiveness a matter of being undetermined or of being\ndetermined by the right things or in the right way? In any case, if\none has the sort of free will that moral responsibility requires\n(whatever that turns out to be) how are we to understand the\nconnection between the will, and what influences it, on the one hand,\nand the various psychological and physical causes that apparently\ndetermine the behavior that is identified as the action one performs\nwillingly, on the other? How do agents with a free will fit within a\nnatural world?\n\nNot surprisingly, the range of answers that have been offered to these\nquestions covers an exceedingly broad spectrum. Some hold that moral\nresponsibility requires a certain kind of freedom and then argue that\nwe lack that sort of freedom or, alternatively, that we at least\nsometimes have it. Others, though, maintain that freedom is irrelevant\nand that holding people morally responsible makes sense only if we see\ntheir wills as determined. And others identify a truly free will not\nwith a will that is undetermined, but with one that is determined by\nreason. And still others argue that the right understanding of moral\nresponsibility will show that metaphysical questions concerning the\nnature of the will are irrelevant. (See the entries on\n free will\n and\n moral responsibility.)\n8. Moral Principles and Particular Judgments\n\nThe history of moral theory is a history of attempts to identify,\narticulate, and defend general moral principles that serve to explain\nwhen and why various types of action, institutions, or characters\ncount as right or wrong, just or unjust, virtuous or vicious. The\nassumption has consistently been that there is a general and\nprincipled account of morality to be given. And this assumption has\nsurvived the fact that few people think any particular set of\nprinciples that we have actually succeeded in articulating, is fully\nadequate. What explains the assumption? Why not hold, as\nparticularists do, that there may well be no set of general principles\nthat adequately mark moral distinctions? Or, why not think, as\nskeptics do, that our repeated failures actually to identify fully\nadequate principles shows that morality is a chimera? (See the entries\non\n moral particularism\n and\n moral particularism and moral generalism.)\n\nWrestling with these questions returns one immediately and directly to\nwondering about the nature of morality and the role it is supposed to\nplay in human life. What is it about morality\u2019s nature, or its\nrole, that would make sense of the idea that general principles are\nessential to it? Why not suppose that one case of cruelty might be\nwrong, and another not wrong, without there being any ground that\nwould justify treating them as different? Why is it so natural to\nsuppose that there must be some other difference\u2014say a\ndifference in their consequences, or a difference in what has led up\nto the act of cruelty\u2014that underwrites and justifies the thought\nthat one is wrong, but not the other? Why not grant that one of the\ntwo just happened to be wrong and the other happened not to be? Could\nnot moral properties just happen to have been distributed randomly so\nthat, in the end, there is no justification for one action having a\ncertain moral standing while another, otherwise the same, has a\ndifferent standing? These suggested possibilities are, I believe, not\nreal possibilities at all. They would each entail that moral demands\nare fundamentally arbitrary in a way that is incompatible with\nmorality\u2019s claim to authority. But what is it about morality\nthat precludes it being fundamentally arbitrary? A good answer, I\nsuspect, will lead one away from the idea that moral properties are\nmerely there in the world to be found, wholly independent of our\nconcerns and practices. But a good answer is needed. And a good answer\nis not provided simply by supplying, if one could, a consistent and\ncoherent set of principles that successfully systematized particular\nmoral judgments about acts, institutions, and characters. The\nchallenge here is not simply to show that moral judgments can be seen\nto fit a pattern; the challenge is to show that the pattern they\nfit\u2014the principle(s) to which they conform\u2014work to explain\nand justify their importance.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ayer, A.
