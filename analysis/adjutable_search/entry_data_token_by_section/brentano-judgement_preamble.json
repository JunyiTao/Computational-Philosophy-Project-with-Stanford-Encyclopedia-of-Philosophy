    "main_text": "\n\nFranz Brentano (1838\u20131917) is famous for arguing in his\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874) that\nintentionality\u2014being directed toward something\u2014is the mark\nof the mental. Brentano used that conception not only for\ndistinguishing mental from physical phenomena, but also for developing\na classification of mental phenomena. If intentionality is a\nfundamental feature of any mental act, Brentano argues, differences in\nthe way mental phenomena are directed toward something constitute\ndifferences in kind between mental acts. Judgements are one of the\nthree basic kinds of intentional phenomena with which Brentano deals\nat great length in his Psychology. That is not to say,\nhowever, that Brentano\u2019s theory of judgement is just concerned\nwith psychological issues. Brentano also aims to show how an\nexperience of judging, specifically the experience of judging\ncorrectly, can provide us with a basis for grasping concepts like\nexistence, truth, and logical inference. Brentano\u2019s\ninvestigation of the mental act of judgement promises therefore to\nadvance logic, epistemology, and ultimately metaphysics.\n\nMuch of that work which Brentano started in his Psychology\nremained unfinished. It was left to his students to further flesh out\nhis view by drawing on lecture notes, letters, and unpublished\nmaterial from Brentano\u2019s Nachlass. Whether all the\nclaims that have been ascribed to Brentano in this literature actually\nbelong to his theory remains a matter of debate in the\n literature.[1]\n From a contemporary perspective, an interesting question is which of\nthe following two claims find support in Brentano\u2019s theory:\n\n(A)\nSome judgements have a propositional content, others not.\n(B)\nNo judgement has a propositional content.\n\n\n(B) will sound to the ears of many contemporary readers surprising. We\nare, Brentano would say, in the grip of a misleading view of\njudgement. Consider an ascription of a judgement:\n\nOskar judges that 5 is prime number.\n\nAn influential analysis takes this sentence to put Oskar in a\nrelation, judgement, to an object designated by \u2018that 5 is a\nprime number\u2019, a proposition that can be true or false. This\nsuggests that judgement is an attitude towards a proposition; it is a\npropositional attitude.\n\nBrentano's student Carl Stumpf anticipated the surprise a reader of\n(B) will feel who has accepted the analysis above:\n\n[O]ne must always bear in mind that he [Brentano] used the term\n\u2018judgement\u2019 in a much more general way than most people in\nordinary usage. One must remember that for him every perception, inner\nas well as external, is a judgement, that he already finds in it an\nelementary assent, a positing [Setzung], and that for him any mental\nact seems from the very beginning connected with an evident\nself-affirmation, hence a judgement in this widest sense. This is of\ncourse nowhere near the view that only knows verbally framed\njudgements (statements) with subject and predicate. (Stumpf 1919, 133;\nauthor translation)\n\nFor Brentano the starting point of a theory of judgement is our\nconsciousness of our acceptance \u2014 in his terminology the\nacknowledgement (Annerkennung) \u2014 of our own mental acts and the\nobjects of (outer) perception. From this starting point he tries to\ncapture what seems to us to be a propositional attitude. As we will\nsee in section 5 Brentano held (at least for a time) the view that a\njudgement that something is so-and-so supervenes on some\nacknowledgments.\n",
