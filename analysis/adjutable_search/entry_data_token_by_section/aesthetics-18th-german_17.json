    "main_text": "Kant: Playing with Truth || Kant\u2019s Theory of Free Play\n7.1 Kant\u2019s Theory of Free Play\n\nFollowing the canonical model introduced into eighteenth-century\naesthetics by Burke and transmitted into Germany by Mendelssohn, Kant\ndivides the first half of the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, the \u201cCritique of the Aesthetic Power of\nJudgment,\u201d into two main parts, the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d and the \u201cAnalytic of the Sublime.\u201d But\nKant actually analyzes three main forms of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014the experience of beauty, paradigmatically natural\nbeauty; the experience of the sublime, again paradigmatically of\nsublimity in nature; and the experience of fine art\u2014and each of\nthese forms of aesthetic experience ultimately reveals distinctive\nconnections to morality.\n\n\nStarting from the claim that Francis Hutcheson had made in 1725 and\nMendelssohn reintroduced in 1785, Kant begins his analysis of the\njudgment of taste, that is, our claim that a particular object is\nbeautiful, from the premise that our pleasure in a beautiful object\noccurs independently of any interest in the existence of the object as\nphysiologically agreeable (CPJ, \u00a73, 5:205\u20137) or as\ngood for some purpose expressed by a determinate concept of utility or\nmorality (CPJ, \u00a74, 5:207\u20139). But neither does a\njudgment of taste does not express a merely idiosyncratic association\nof pleasure with an object. Rather, to call an object beautiful is to\nspeak with a \u201cuniversal voice,\u201d to assert that the\npleasure one takes in the object is one that should be felt by anyone\nwho responds to the object, at least under ideal or optimal\ncircumstances, even though \u201cthere can also be no rule in\naccordance with which someone could be compelled to acknowledge\nsomething as beautiful\u201d (CPJ, \u00a78, 5:216). How can\none\u2019s pleasure in an object be independent of its subsumption under\nany determinate concept and its satisfaction of any determinate\ninterest and yet be valid for all who properly respond to the object?\nKant\u2019s answer is that although our pleasure in a beautiful object is\nnot a response to its subsumption under a determinate concept, it is\nan expression of the free play of the cognitive faculties of\nimagination and understanding that such an object induces, and those\ncognitive faculties must in fact work the same way in everyone. His\nunderlying idea is that we experience a beautiful object as having the\nkind of unity that we ordinarily find in objects by subsuming them\nunder a determinate concept, but independently of any such\nsubsumption. Because finding such unity is our ultimate cognitive aim,\nwe take pleasure in this discovery, especially since the unity we find\nmust appear contingent, as it were unexpected, if it is not linked to\nany determinate concept (see CPJ, Introduction VI,\n5:186\u20137).  (This is not to say that we do not subsume an object\nwe find beautiful under any determinate concepts at all; we must if we\nare even to identify the object of our pleasure and judgment of taste\nin any determinate way. Kant\u2019s theory must rather be that when we find\nan object beautiful we experience it as having a degree of unity that\ncannot be explained by any of the determinate concepts under which we\ndo subsume it). Kant thus appeals to the concept of free play, hinted\nat by Mendelssohn and developed further by Sulzer, to solve the\nproblem of taste that was emphasized by British aestheticians such as\nHutcheson and Hume, with whose works Kant was intimately familiar.\n\n\nIn this account, Kant makes two striking assumptions. First, he\nasserts that in \u201cpure\u201d judgments of taste our pleasure in\nbeauty is a response only to the perceptible form of an\nobject, not to any matter or content it may have\u2014for example, in\npictorial arts, \u201cthe drawing is what is\nessential,\u201d while the \u201ccolors that illuminate the\noutline\u2026can\u2026enliven the object in itself for sensation,\nbut cannot make it\u2026beautiful\u201d (CPJ, \u00a714,\n5:225). Second, he assumes that the cognitive faculties of all human\nbeings work the same way, that is, respond to particular objects in\nthe same way, even when they are in \u201cfree play\u201d rather\nthan at serious work. The second of these claims seems indefensible,\nbut Kant never backs off from it. The first of these claims also seems\nunjustifiable, but this time Kant modifies his claim almost as soon as\nhe makes it. While he continues to maintain that in pure judgments of\ntaste our pleasure is in the unity of the form of the object alone, he\nquickly recognizes that there are a variety of impure forms\nof beauty where what we respond to with the free play of our\nimagination and understanding is harmony between an object\u2019s\nperceptible form and its matter, its content, or even its\npurpose. Thus, just two sections after his assertion of formalism,\nKant introduces the category of \u201cadherent beauty,\u201d which\nis the kind of harmony between an object\u2019s form and its intended\nfunction that pleases us in a beautiful summer-house or racehorse; and\nhe will subsequently assume that successful works of fine art normally\nhave intellectual content and please us in virtue of the harmony among\ntheir content, form, and material.\n\n\nHowever, Kant interposes his analysis of the experience of the sublime\nbetween his initial analysis of pure beauty and his later analysis of\nfine art. Again following a hint that we have already found in\nMendelssohn, Kant recognizes two forms of the sublime: the\n\u201cmathematical\u201d and the \u201cdynamical.\u201d Our\nexperience of both is a mixture of pain and pleasure, a moment of pain\ndue to an initial sense of the limits of imagination followed by\npleasure at the recognition that it is our own power of reason that\nreveals the limits of our imagination. The mathematical sublime\ninvolves the relationship between imagination and theoretical reason,\nwhich is the source of our idea of the infinite; our experience of\nthis form of the sublime is triggered by the observation of natural\nvistas so vast that our effort to grasp them in a\nsingle image is bound to fail, but which then pleases us\nbecause this very effort of the imagination reminds us that we have a\npower of reason capable of formulating the idea of the\ninfinite (CPJ, \u00a726, 5:254\u20135).\n\n\nKant holds that in this experience we do not just infer that\nwe have such a faculty, but actually experience \u201ca\nfeeling that we have pure self-sufficient reason\u201d (CPJ,\n\u00a727, 5:258). In the case of the dynamical sublime, what we\nexperience is a harmony between our imagination and practical\nreason. This experience is induced by natural objects that seem not\njust vast, but overwhelmingly powerful and\nthreatening\u2014volcanoes, raging seas, and the like (CPJ,\n\u00a728, 5:261.  Kant\u2019s examples were all commonplaces in the\neighteenth century, going back to Joseph Addison\u2019s illustrations of\n\u201cgrandeur\u201d in Spectator 412, June 1712). Here we\nexperience fear at the thought of our own physical injury or\ndestruction followed by the satisfying feeling that we have\nwithin ourselves a capacity for resistance of\nquite another kind, which gives us the courage to measure ourselves\nagainst the apparent all-powerfulness of nature,\n\n\nnamely,\nour power (which is not part of nature) to regard\nthose things about which we are concerned (goods, health and life) as\ntrivial, and hence to regard its power (to which, to be sure, we are\nsubjected in regard to these things) as not the sort of dominion over\nourselves and our authority to which we would have to bow if it came\ndown to our highest principles and their affirmation or\nabandonment. (CPJ, \u00a728, 5:262)\n\n\n\nNow we can turn to Kant\u2019s analysis of fine art and our experience of\nit. For Kant, all art is intentional human production that requires\nskill or talent, yet fine or \u201cbeautiful\u201d (sch\u00f6ne)\nart is produced with the intention of doing what anything beautiful\ndoes, namely, promoting the free play of the cognitive powers. That a\nwork of fine art must be the product of intention and yet\nproduce the free play of the mental powers seems like the\nparadox that \u201cbeautiful art, although it is certainly\nintentional, must nevertheless not seem intentional\u201d\n(CPJ, \u00a745, 5:306\u20137). Further, Kant also assumes\nthat although our pleasure in beauty should be a response to\nthe form of an object alone, fine art is paradigmatically\nmimetic, that is, has representational or semantic content\n(CPJ, \u00a748, 5:311). This too seems like a paradox. Kant\naims to resolve both of these apparent paradoxes through his theory\nthat successful works of fine art are products of genius, a natural\ngift that gives the rule to art (CPJ, \u00a746, 5:307). A\nwork of genius must have \u201cspirit,\u201d which it gets through\nits content, typically\u2014as Kant assumes without argument,\nalthough perhaps in his time, long before the invention of\nnon-objective art, without any real need for argument\u2014a rational\nidea, indeed an idea relevant specifically to morality. But in order\nto be beautiful, a work of art must still leave room for the freedom\nof the imagination, and therefore cannot present such ideas to us\ndirectly and didactically (indeed, such ideas cannot be\ndirectly and adequately presented in sensible form). Instead, a work\nof art succeeds when it presents an \u201caesthetic idea,\u201d a\nrepresentation of the imagination that \u201cat least strive[s]\ntoward something lying beyond the bounds of experience, and thus\nseek[s] to approximate a presentation of the concepts of\nreason.\u201d A successful work of art also \u201cstimulates so much\nthinking,\u201d such a wealth of particular \u201cattributes\u201d\nor images and incidents, \u201cthat it can never be grasped in a\ndeterminate concept\u201d (CPJ, \u00a749,\n5:314\u201315)\u2014thereby stimulating a pleasurable feeling of\nfree play among the imagination, understanding, and reason while at\nthe same time satisfying the demand that a work of art have both a\npurpose and a content.\n",
