    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s theory\n2. Frege\u2019s theory\n\nFrege held that correct propositional attitude attributions must\nindicate the way that individuals are represented by the agent (the\nagent\u2019s mode of presentation of the referent) and that\nan occurrence of a referential expression within the scope of a\npropositional attitude verb refers to a way of representing an object\nrather than to the expression\u2019s ordinary referent.\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019 as they occur in (5)\nand (6) refer to the same man, known under these two different names.\n(5) and (6) share common referents but express different propositions\nor thoughts. Those same expressions as they occur in (1) and (4),\nhowever, refer to different ways that Lois has of representing the man\nSuperman. According to Frege, this difference in reference explains\nthe difference in truth-value of (1) and (4). The ordinary sense of an\nexpression \u2013 the way that the expression indicates its referent\n\u2013 becomes a part of the truth-conditions for a sentence in which\nthe expression occurs, if that expression is used within a belief\ncontext. Within this linguistic environment, expressions refer to\ntheir customary senses.\n\nFrege held two distinct theses about terms in the scope of\npropositional attitude verbs \u2013 that they refer to the\nagent\u2019s way of representing the object and that they refer to\nthe ordinary sense. Frege unifies these theses by maintaining that the\nordinary sense is a way of representing an object. Thus he can explain\nthe difference in truth-value between (1) and (4). Propositional\nattitude verbs induce a shift in reference; occurrences of expressions\nwithin their scope refer to what Frege called their customary sense.\nWithin the scope of an attitude verb expressions refer to what they\nexpress when outside the scope of an attitude verb. So, although\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019 are co-referring as\nthey occur in (5) and (6), they are not in (1) and (4), when inside\nthe scope of a propositional attitude verb.\n\nFrege\u2019s claim that propositional attitude verbs induce a\nreference shift allows him to preserve a substitution principle. The\nfact that (1) is true while (4) is false does not show that\nsubstituting co-referring singular terms within the scope of attitude\nverbs is illegitimate; instead, for Frege, it shows that\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark\u2019, as they occur in\n(1) and (4), are not co-referring.\n\nThe difference in sense between \u2018Superman\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark\u2019 also explains the difference in cognitive value\nbetween (5) and (6). Although both sentences have the same\ntruth-value, because the constituents are co-referential, they express\ndifferent senses, because the names \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 and\n\u2018Superman\u2019 express different senses, according to Frege.\nAlthough the truth-value of a sentence depends on the referents of\nterms, the cognitive value depends on the senses attached to the\nterms.\n\n[For further discussion of Frege\u2019s theory, see the subsection on\n Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.]\n\nSo, Frege\u2019s accounts of the two problems he calls our attention\nto coincide. (1) and (4) differ in truth-value precisely because (5)\nand (6) express different propositions.\n",
