In a sense, this question is best answered on the basis of a\ncareful reading of some good historians. But it will be useful to\noffer several simple answers to this foundational question as a sort\nof conceptual map of the nature of historical knowing.\n\nFirst, historians are interested in providing conceptualizations and\nfactual descriptions of events and circumstances in the past. This\neffort is an answer to questions like these: \u201cWhat happened?\nWhat was it like? What were some of the circumstances and happenings\nthat took place during this period in the past?\u201d Sometimes this\nmeans simply reconstructing a complicated story from scattered\nhistorical sources\u2014for example, in constructing a narrative of\nthe Spanish Civil War or attempting to sort out the series of events\nthat culminated in the Detroit race riot / uprising of 1967. But\nsometimes it means engaging in substantial conceptual work in order to\narrive at a vocabulary in terms of which to characterize \u201cwhat\nhappened.\u201d Concerning the disorders of 1967 in Detroit: was this\na riot or an uprising? How did participants and contemporaries think\nabout it?\n\nSecond, historians often want to answer \u201cwhy\u201d questions:\n\u201cWhy did this event occur? What were the conditions and forces\nthat brought it about?\u201d What were the motivations of the\nparticipants? This body of questions invites the historian to provide\nan explanation of the event or pattern he or she describes: the rise\nof fascism in Spain, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the\noccurrence of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia in 1992 and later. And\nproviding an explanation requires, most basically, an account of the\ncausal mechanisms, background circumstances, and human choices that\nbrought the outcome about. We explain an historical outcome when we\nidentify the social causes, forces, events, and actions that brought\nit about, or made it more likely.\n\nThird, and related to the previous point, historians are sometimes\ninterested in answering a \u201chow\u201d question: \u201cHow did\nthis outcome come to pass? What were the processes through which the\noutcome occurred?\u201d How did the Prussian Army succeed in\ndefeating the superior French Army in 1870? How did the Polish trade\nunion Solidarity manage to bring about the end of Communist rule in\nPoland in 1989? Here the pragmatic interest of the historian\u2019s\naccount derives from the antecedent unlikelihood of the event in\nquestion: how was this outcome possible? This too is an explanation;\nbut it is an answer to a \u201chow possible\u201d question rather\nthan a \u201cwhy necessary\u201d question.\n\nFourth, often historians are interested in piecing together the human\nmeanings and intentions that underlie a given complex series of\nhistorical actions. They want to help the reader make sense of the\nhistorical events and actions, in terms of the thoughts, motives, and\nstates of mind of the participants. For example: Why did Napoleon III\ncarelessly provoke Prussia into war in 1870? Why did the parties of\nthe far right in Germany gain popular support among German citizens in\nthe 1990s? Why did northern cities in the United States develop such\nmarked patterns of racial segregation after World War II? Answers to\nquestions like these require interpretation of actions, meanings, and\nintentions\u2014of individual actors and of cultures that\ncharacterize whole populations. This aspect of historical thinking is\n\u201chermeneutic,\u201d interpretive, and ethnographic.\n\nAnd, of course, the historian faces an even more basic intellectual\ntask: that of discovering and making sense of the archival and\nhistorical information that exists about a given event or time in the\npast. Historical data do not speak for themselves; archives are\nincomplete, ambiguous, contradictory, and confusing. The historian\nneeds to interpret individual pieces of evidence, and he or she needs\nto be able to somehow fit the mass of evidence into a coherent and\ntruthful story. Complex events like the Spanish Civil War present the\nhistorian with an ocean of historical traces in repositories and\narchives all over the world; these collections sometimes reflect\nspecific efforts at concealment by the powerful (for example,\nFranco\u2019s efforts to conceal all evidence of mass killings of\nRepublicans after the end of fighting); and the historian\u2019s task\nis to find ways of using this body of evidence to discern some of the\ntruth about the past.\n\nIn short, historians conceptualize, describe, contextualize, explain,\nand interpret events and circumstances of the past. They sketch out\nways of representing the complex activities and events of the past;\nthey explain and interpret significant outcomes; and they base their\nfindings on evidence in the present that bears upon facts about the\npast. Their accounts need to be grounded on the evidence of the\navailable historical record, and their explanations and\ninterpretations require that the historian arrive at hypotheses about\nsocial causes and cultural meanings. Historians can turn to the best\navailable theories in the social and behavioral sciences to arrive at\ntheories about causal mechanisms and human behavior; so historical\nstatements depend ultimately upon factual inquiry and theoretical\nreasoning. Ultimately, the historian\u2019s task is to shed light on\nthe what, why, and how of the past, based on inferences from the\nevidence of the present.\n\nThree preliminary issues are relevant to almost all discussions of\nhistory and the philosophy of history. The first is a set of issues\nhaving to do with the \"ontology\" of history, the kinds of entities,\nprocesses, and events that make up the historical past. This topic\nconcerns the entities, forces, and structures that we postulate in\ndescribing the historical phenomena, whether the medieval manor or the\nWeimar Republic, and the theory we have of how these social entities\ndepend upon the actions of the historical actors who embody them. The\nsecond issue has to do with the problems of selectivity unavoidable\nfor the historian of any period or epoch. Here we take up the question\nof how the unavoidable selectivity of historical inquiry in terms of\ntheme, location, scope, and scale influences the nature of historical\nknowledge. The third issue has to do with the complicated relationship\nthat exists between history, narrative, and collective memory. This\ntopic addresses the point that real human beings make history. And, as\nMarc Bloch insists (1953), we humans are historical beings, we tell\nstories about ourselves, and those stories sometimes themselves have\nmajor historical consequences. The collective memories and identities\nof Serb nationalism were a historical fact in the 1990s, and these\nelements of mythic collective identity led to massive bloodshed,\nethnic cleansing, and murder during the violent breakup of Yugoslavia\n(Judt and Snyder, 2012; Judt, 2006).\n",
