In his\nEncyclop\u00e9die entry on cabinets of natural history and\ntheir philosophical implications (\u201cCabinets d\u2019histoire\nnaturelle\u201d), he reflects explicitly on the challenge for our\nfinite intellects to seek to know infinite Nature as a whole, and\nrecommends the construction of artificial environments such as these\ncabinets in order to study \u201cparts of Nature\u201d. At times,\nhis vision of aesthetics is simply a kind of extension of his\nnaturalism into other domains, arguing like Spinoza that our\nsubjective notions of beauty and ugliness have no place in nature\nproperly understood (in the article \u201cLaideur\u201d; also\nSalon de 1763; DPV XIII: 373\u2013374), and argues for a\nnaturalist poetics (\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d; DPV VII: 234).\nYet he also held that aesthetics should not be reduced to crudely\nnaturalistic concepts, reflecting at length on the subjective issues\nof aesthetic perception and judgment and the role of performance,\nincluding that found in visual art, literature, theater, and\nscientific experiments, in the production of perceived truths.\n\nWith respect to the ostensibly subjective side of human knowing, he\ninvested considerable energy in articulating a concept of\n\u201cperception of relations\u201d (perception des\nrapports) which functions both as a theory of judgment\n(explaining why it is that we find certain kinds of symmetry and\nproportion pleasing) and a theory of cognitive functioning at a more\nbasic level, one characterized by psychoneural relations, as it were.\nCountering that subjective emphasis, however, Diderot also warned\nagainst the \u201csurfeit\u201d of organic sensitivity as a source\nof hyper-reactivity, and of sensory stimulus as a ground for\nperception without any internal unifying principle. These reflections\nare also found in the character Bordeu in the R\u00eave who\nserves to ground the perceptions and queries from Mlle de\nLespinasse regarding the ravings of the dreaming D\u2019Alembert in a\nclear objective ground. Diderot describes the overly sensitive actor\nin the Paradoxe sur le com\u00e9dien as suffering from a\n\u201cweakness in their constitution\u201d, and speaks ironically\nabout the welter of emotions (\u201cdes sensibilit\u00e9s\ndiverses\u201d) on stage being incapable of forming a unified\nwhole.\n2.5.2 Philosophy of language and representation\n\nUnifying these two aspects was the eclectic Malebranchian emphasis\nupon language as the bridge between the finite and the infinite, the\nmaterial and immaterial, the human knower and nature as a whole. In\nhis aesthetics, Diderot is continually preoccupied with the power of\nart to capture and represent natural experience and its limitation in\nthe face of the infinitude, and often unrepresentable complexity, of\nlife. In meta-works of what might be called his philosophy of theater\nsuch as Discours de la po\u00e9sie dramatique and\nParadoxe sur le com\u00e9dien, and in his dialogue where he\nconversed out loud with his readers about the theatrical logic\nunderlying his play Le Fils naturel, Diderot also pursued\nsuch themes by subjecting the \u201creality effect\u201d of\ntheatrical art to a systematic interrogation so as to unearth the\nrational structures of theater as a representative art form.\n\nDiderot reflected famously and influentially on what he called the\n\u201cfourth wall of the theatre\u201d, that imaginary barrier that\nseparates an audience from the three dimensions of the stage it faces.\nThis is a barrier that for Diderot acts either as conscious division\ndividing the actors and the drama from its viewer (theatre as a\nconsciously artificial way of representing and knowing) or as an\ninvisible screen through which the two join together into the joint\nexperience of the theatrical moment (theater as a staged naturalism).\nWhile still important in theatre theory today\u2014Richard Sennett\ninterprets Diderot as \u201cthe first great theorist of acting as a\nsecular activity\u201d and as the innovator who creates a theory of\ndrama \u201cdivorced from ritual\u201d\u2014Diderot\u2019s\nwritings on theatre also offer yet another example of his wider\nmetaphysical and physiological understanding of human beings and their\nembodied interrelation. They also highlight the role of language\nthroughout his philosophy as a tangible yet permeable and sometimes\nfragile tether joining humans and their knowing together.\n\nIn a manner similar to his \u201cphilosophy of theatre\u201d,\nDiderot\u2019s art criticism is also very often a study of the\ncontinually recurring interplay between sensible human subjectivity\nand the natural world through the perceived empirical reality of\nnatural representation. What happens when a viewer stands in front of\na painting and experiences its imagery? In particular, what is the\nrelationship between the reality of the viewer in the Louvre in the\nsalon gallery in front of the paintings on display and the reality of\nthe world represented by the image? What is it that happens exactly as\nwe move between these two worlds and realities? And given the presence\nof both a painting and its artist at the center of this exchange, what\nis the role played by the painter, his material medium, his craft in\nmanipulating matter into representations, and the viewing subject who\nboth receives this artistic work in her own senses and then recreates\nit in her imagination in the making of a \u201cnatural\nexperience\u201d?\n\nTo combine all these dimensions into a coherent concept of art, as\nDiderot did in his art criticism, was to produce a general aesthetics\nexploring the capacity for human representations to render experience\ntruthful and meaningful. Here, Diderot also explored the power and\nlimitations of such practices as a form of human experience. In this\nway, the problem of viewing art and speaking about the experience of\nviewing art, or the question of judging artists that stage this\nexperience, is akin to the problem of viewing and speaking about\nnature itself, and of judging the nature of the presentations put\nbefore us. Diderot\u2019s \u201cpromenade Vernet\u201d in the\nSalon de 1767 is something of a locus classicus for these\ninvestigations with its extended reflection on the presence of the\nviewer in front of a Vernet landscape painting and the being of that\nviewer in the natural world that the painting represents as well. His\nwork in natural philosophy and the life sciences often manifests a\nsimilar subject-object preoccupation as well, and in this respect\nDiderot\u2019s aesthetics and his natural philosophy have much in\ncommon.\n\nThe same combination is present in Diderot\u2019s literary fiction as\nwell in his continual, and often critical, exploration of the\nempirical reality of linguistic representation, and our capacities and\nlimitations for experiencing and knowing the world through such\nrepresentations. Jacques le fataliste, for example, is a kind\nof anti-novel that thwarts the arrival of naturalized realism and\ncredible illusion at every turn even as it narrates a bawdy and\nfrolicking story. Characters break with the scenes and dialogue of the\nstory to talk directly to the reader, and the narrator himself is a\nself-conscious character in the work who often finds himself in a\nstruggle with the fictions he is supposedly controlling and\nrepresenting for his readers.\n\nLe R\u00eave de D\u2019Alembert is also concerned with the\nrelation between author, textual characters, and the naturalistic and\nrational representation of thought in language and text, as is Le\nNeveu de Rameau, but while these dialogues organize the play\nbetween their various registers in a way that produces constructive\nphilosophical investigation, Jacques le fataliste operates\ndeconstructively, subverting the basic coherence of the novel as a\nform by repeating paragraphs verbatim on multiple pages and by\nintentionally distorting the book\u2019s narrative coherence and\nflow. One entire page of the book is printed in complete black, for\nexample, to call attention to the print characters that make all\nreading and linguistic communication possible. Diderot\u2019s story\nCeci n\u2019est pas un conte also operates in this\nsubversive and deconstructive way by prefiguring Magritte\u2019s\nfamous conundrum regarding the image of a pipe through a\nself-destructive recursion of a story that uses storytelling to deny\nthe possibility of storytelling even as it narrates a story.\n2.5.3 Ethics\n\nOne striking feature of Diderot\u2019s moral thought is his\nself-described failure to write a work of moral philosophy. While\nDiderot wanted to write such a work in order to refute La Mettrian\nimmoralism, especially its particularly bracing form of hedonism\ncoupled with its cynical social theory, he ultimately did not succeed\nin this ambition. He interestingly described his failure, or rather\nreluctance, to write a work of ethics as stemming from his recognition\nthat,\n\n\nif I do not emerge victorious from this attempt, I shall become the\napologist of wickedness, I will have betrayed the cause of virtue, and\nencouraged man towards vice. (RH: DPV XXIV: 589)\n\n\nDiderot had no desire to use his writings to ensure \u201cthe\nimmortality of the evildoer\u201d (ibid.; ERCN II,\n6; DPV XXV: 246\u2013247), and at the same time he also considered\nnormative moral philosophy to be a failure, a view he shared with such\nvirtuous individuals as Locke. (In response to his friend Lady\nPeterborough\u2019s request for advice on how to morally educate her\nson, Lord Morduant, Locke recommended, in a 1697 letter, that he\nshould read Livy (for history), along with geography and the study of\nmorality. But, he explained, \u201cI mean not the ethics of the\nschools\u201d, but rather Tully (i.e., Cicero), Pufendorf,\nAristotle and \u201cabove all the New Testament\u201d, wherein\n\u201ca man may learn how to live which is the business of ethics,\nand not how to define and distinguish and dispute about the names of\nvirtue and vice\u201d (King 1829: 5\u20136). This is not a ringing\nendorsement of academic moral philosophy, and Locke reiterates this\nview in his Thoughts Concerning Education, \u00a7 185 and the\nReasonableness of Christianity, \u00a7\u00a7\n241\u2013242.)\n\nAnother crucial feature of Diderot\u2019s ethics was his dislike for\nrelativism or at least for some of its possible consequences. Diderot\nlearned a great deal from Locke, Montaigne and other paragons of early\nWestern cultural relativism. Montaigne and Locke paid close attention\nto the case of cannibals; Locke, when he takes up the case of\ncannibals in the Essay, uses it to support anti-innatist\nviews with respect to what he calls \u201cpractical principles\u201d\n(that is, moral principles of conduct): he points out that the\nTupinamba tribe in the Amazon considers that a high form of virtue is\neating one\u2019s enemies, along with many other examples of\n\u201cenormities practised without remorse\u201d, in order\nto stress that \u201cmoral rules\u201d are not innate but culturally\nspecific and learned (Locke 1690 [1975: I.iii.9]). The challenge is\nnot to morals per se but to \u201cmores\u201d and customs which we\ntake to encapsulate morality. Diderot echoes these ideas notably in\nhis Suppl\u00e9ment au voyage de Bougainville, but contrary\nto widespread views, he did not think that such relativism had to\nentail libertinage, criticizing Hemsterhuis for reasoning \u201cas if\nlibertinage was a necessary consequence of materialism, which seems to\nme to match neither reason nor experience\u201d (OH; DPV\nXXIV: 251). Unlike La Mettrie (and the Marquis de Sade after him),\nDiderot maintained a strongly social concept of self. \u201cHe who\nhas studied himself\u201d, he wrote, \u201cwill have advanced in the\nknowledge of others, given, I think, that there is no virtue which is\nforeign to the wicked, nor vice foreign to the good\u201d\n(ERCN; DPV XXV: 226).While he did not develop a full-fledged\ntheory of sympathy like Hume or Smith, Diderot was nevertheless\nacutely conscious of the role of the passions in cementing the social\nbond, and how this role should be promoted in any viable ethical\ntheory.\n\nNevertheless, his hostility to immoralist versions of materialism did\nnot mean that he reneged on his overall naturalism, since his account\nof our behavior, and of good and evil, also seeks to tie it to our\nphysiological constitution (our organisation, in his\nterms).\n\n\nEthics is confined to the borders of a species \u2026 What is a\nspecies? A mass of individuals sharing a similar constitution. What,\nis this constitution the basis of ethics?\u2026 I believe so.\n(SA; DPV XVI: 206)\n\n\nIt is perhaps too naturalistic an ethics for some since \u201cthere\nis no rational goodness or wickedness, although there may be animal\ngoodness or wickedness\u201d (\u201cDroit naturel\u201d,\nEnc. V: 155b). By this Diderot means that we do not act in\naccordance with purely transcendent or immaterial principles in mind,\nbut that we are determined by motives, affects, desires, instincts and\nso on. Yet at the same time, as we also saw regarding determinism,\nDiderot is concerned not only with the universe in its entirety but\nwith specifically human chains of causal influence as well.\n\u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d he asks. \u201cAn animal?\nUndoubtedly, but dogs are animals too; so are wolves. Yet humans are\nneither wolves nor dogs\u201d (SA; DPV XVI: 205).\n\nDiderot explicitly eschews the natural ties that many see tying a\nmaterialist conception of human being directly and naturally with\nlibertinism, hedonism, and a purely self-interested and solipsistic\nconception of morality. This stance was reinforced in other ways by\nhis counter-conception of natural morality, an ethics which he often\ncelebrated in his writings about aesthetic representation and its\nvalue. At the center of the naturalism that Diderot claimed for this\nethics was an implicit set of claims about experience, feeling, and\naction in human life. The natural principles of sensibility spoke\ndirectly to humans about the division between virtue and vice, or so\nDiderot believed, and while the virtuous individual was the one who\nsubmitted to the natural passions inherent in us pushing us toward\ncamaraderie and filial love, the vicious soul was a willful and\narrogant rebel who chases selfish desire and self-gratification\nagainst the grain of what is naturally good and true.\n\nThis metaphysical and physiological understanding of morality was\ncentral to Diderot\u2019s politics as well, and with respect to\ntheater it led him to theorize the mechanisms by which human\nperformance and theatrical display both supported and corrupted the\npursuit of virtue. Rousseau, with similar ethical orientations,\ncondemned theater outright as a false and corrupting medium, arguing\nthat natural religion and virtue could only be practiced in a natural,\ni.e., non-artificial or non-theatrical way. Diderot\u2019s view was\nmuch more complicated. While he recognized the corrupting power of\nartistic representation to deceive, he also recognized its power to\nprovoke and sustain natural experiences that promoted moral virtue.\nHis impassioned speeches written for imagined Africans oppressed by\nEuropean slavery, which he included in his contributions to\nRaynal\u2019s Histoire des deux Indes, illustrate well the\nfusion of theater and politics characteristic of Diderot. In these\nmoments, Diderot used the full power of theatrical language and\nartificial representation to present an unequivocal statement about\nmoral and political righteousness, one designed to move people to\nprogressive and virtuous political action. Rousseau\u2019s prize\nessay discourses produced in the 1750s were also influential upon\nDiderot in shaping his views, for like Rousseau Diderot developed an\nideal of natural, egalitarian, communitarian virtue, which he found\nmost fully developed in simple, rustic people who lived modestly and\nin close relation to their natural surroundings. Diderot also\ndeveloped a countervailing conception of vice that was directly\nconnected to wealth, especially wealth attached to elite privilege,\nand a morality that encouraged people to embrace basic organic\nfoundations for life and to turn away from urban lives of selfishness\nand hedonism. The same morality infused his political economic\nwritings as well, both in his celebration of the communitarian power\nof commerce to unite people into virtuous and prosperous polities, and\nin his critique of greed and commercial excess as a cause for social\nviolence and political injustice.\n2.5.4 \u201cMan and world\u201d\n\nAt the level of aesthetics, ethics or ontology itself, Diderot is a\nmaterialist concerned with utility, praxis, transformation and yes,\nagency (up to a point). Some commentators in earlier generations\nthought this spelled contradiction and the lack of any cogent\nphilosophical position. More recently, it has been recognized that\nDiderot was precisely reflecting on this tension between the\ncosmos and time-scales stretching millions of years, and his love for\nSophie Volland, or his desire to see goodness rewarded and wickedness\npunished. Indeed, he sometimes offers at least partial solutions to\nthis old aporia. If it is true, on the one hand, that\n\n\nThe universe only presents to us particular beings, infinite in\nnumber, with hardly any fixed or determinate division. None can be\ntermed the first or the last; everything is linked therein, and\nfollows what came before by imperceptible nuances. In this immense\nuniformity of objects, if some appear which, like the tips of rocks,\nseem to pierce through the surface and dominate it, they only owe this\nprerogative to particular systems, vague conventions, and foreign\nevents, not to the physical arrangement of beings and the intention of\nNature (\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d, Enc. V: 641b)\n\n\nso that there is no place for the human observer in this desolate\nlandscape, it is also true, on the other hand, that the only thing\nthat makes the existence of the spectacle of Nature interesting is the\nhuman presence itself:\n\n\nOne consideration above all must not be lost sight of, and that is\nthat if man or the thinking, contemplating being is banished from the\nsurface of the earth, this moving and sublime spectacle of nature\nbecomes nothing but a sad and mute scene\u2026. Everything changes\ninto a vast solitude where unobserved phenomena occur in a manner dark\nand mute. (Enc. V: 641c)\n\n\nInstead of losing himself in reveries about the poetics of ruins and\nour transitory existence on the face of the earth, however, Diderot\ninstantly asserts the pragmatic, \u201cconstructivist\u201d and\nartificialist conclusion: since \u201cIt is the presence of man that\nmakes the existence of beings interesting\u201d, \u201cWhy not make\nman the center of our work?\u201d The anthropocentrism here is of\ncourse not one which appeals to a human essence, or special dignity\nincluding some purported superiority we might possess over animals. It\nis rather a pragmatic position according to which schemes like the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, but also the arts, sciences and\ntechnological pursuits narrated in that work, serve to make that\n\u201clandscape\u201d meaningful.\n3. Conclusion\n\nFor Diderot, there is only one substance and it is material. Here, he\nis loosely aligned with Spinoza. But this substance is in perpetual\nflux (a more Lucretian element in his thought), so that the individual\nbeings we encounter are merely temporary, provisional clusters of\nmolecules in interaction with one another, in the midst of what he\nterms the general \u201cvicissitude\u201d of the cosmos (by which he\nmeans its change). In the entry \u201cImmuable\u201d\n(\u201cImmutable\u201d) he writes that \u201cNature is in a state\nof perpetual vicissitude. It follows from the general law of all\nbodies: either they are in motion, or they tend to be in motion\u201d\n(Enc. VIII: 577).\n\nBorrowing a Heraclitean motif and adding a now rather dated gender\ninflection, Diderot also describes Nature as a woman who enjoys\ndisguises (IN, \u00a7 XII, doubtless alluding to\nHeraclitus\u2019 phusis kruptesthai philei, \u201cNature\nlikes to hide\u201d, frag. 208). This is also why there are no\nmonsters in any real sense:\n\n\nI speak of monstrosity relative to what they are at present, for there\nare no monsters relative to the whole \u2026. If everything is\nin fluxu, which we can hardly doubt, all beings are\nmonstrous, that is, more or less incompatible with their corresponding\norder. (OH; DPV XXIV: 317, 403)\n\n\nThe matter of which we, as well as all other entities in the universe,\nare composed, is heterogeneous: differing in terms of energy and\nsensitivity, and in perpetually evolving relation to the Whole:\n\n\nThe world is ceaselessly beginning and ending; it is at every moment\nat the beginning and at the end; it never had, and never will have any\nother. In this vast ocean of matter, not one molecule resembles\nanother, not one molecule is self-identical for one moment.\n(RA; DPV XVII: 128)\n\n\nThat is, Nature is both fundamentally heterogeneous (the atoms which\ncompose the natural world exist in a state of heterogeneity and\nagitation) and never entirely \u201cspecific\u201d:\n\n\neach thing is more or less specific (quelconque), more or\nless earth, more or less water, more or less air, more or less fire;\nmore or less belonging to one kingdom or another \u2026 hence there\nis no essence of a particular being. (RA; DPV XVII: 138)\n\n\nAll beings\n\n\nhave an infinite number of relations to one another, according to the\nqualities they have in common; \u2026 it is a certain assemblage of\nqualities which characterizes them and distinguishes them\n(BI; DPV III: 183)\n\n\nIn this ever-changing Whole, there are provisional constructs and\nentities that are, like everything else, wholly material, but can be\nof greater or lesser significance to us, whether this is \u201ccashed\nout\u201d aesthetically, emotionally, ethico-politically or even in\nterms of nerve impulses (and Diderot, most of the time, is not wont to\ndistinguish sharply between these).\n\nDiderot invented a new form of materialism, drawing on a variety of\nsources including the Epicurean tradition, Hobbes and Locke, Spinoza\nand Leibniz. He also transformed doctrines, genres and nascent\nintellectual constellations (skepticism, the philosophical novel, and\neclecticism, to name some instances). Even if he did not wish to\ncontribute to the genre of systematic philosophy, his contribution to\nthe Enlightenment (and its posterity) and to subsequent intellectual\nepisodes is considerable, difficult to measure, and should be engaged\nwith.",
