    "main_text": "Ordering relations between truth-values || The notion of a logical order\n3.1 The notion of a logical order\n\nAs soon as one admits that truth values come with valuation\nsystems, it is quite natural to assume that the elements of\nsuch a system are somehow interrelated. And indeed, already\nthe valuation system for classical logic constitutes a well-known\nalgebraic structure, namely the two-element Boolean algebra with\n\\(\\cap\\) and \\(\\cup\\) as meet and join operators (see the entry on the\n mathematics of Boolean algebra).\n In its turn, this Boolean algebra forms a lattice with a partial\norder defined by \\(a\\le_t b \\textrm{ iff } a\\cap b = a\\). This\nlattice may be referred to as TWO. It is easy to see that the\nelements of TWO are ordered as follows: \\(F\\le_t T\\). This\nordering is sometimes called the truth order (as indicated by\nthe corresponding subscript), for intuitively it expresses an increase\nin truth: \\(F\\) is \u201cless true\u201d than \\(T\\). It can be\nschematically presented by means of a so-called Hasse-diagram as in\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lattice TWO\n\n\nIt is also well-known that the truth values of both Kleene\u2019s and\nPriest\u2019s logic can be ordered to form a lattice\n(THREE), which is diagrammed in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lattice THREE\n\n\nHere \\(\\le_t\\) orders \\(T, I\\) and \\(F\\) so that the intermediate\nvalue \\(I\\) is \u201cmore true\u201d than \\(F\\), but \u201cless\ntrue\u201d than \\(T\\).\n\nThe relation \\(\\le_t\\) is also called a logical order,\nbecause it can be used to determine key logical notions: logical\nconnectives and an entailment relation. Namely, if the elements of the\ngiven valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) form a lattice, then the\noperations of meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) are usually seen\nas the functions for conjunction and disjunction, whereas negation can\nbe represented by the inversion of this order. Moreover, one can\nconsider an entailment relation for \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) as expressing\nagreement with the truth order, that is, the conclusion should be at\nleast as true as the premises taken together:\n\n\n\\[\n\\tag{8}\n \u0394\\vDash B\\textrm{ iff }\\forall v_a[\\Pi_t\\{ v_a (A) \\mid A \\in \u0394\\} \\le_t v_a (B)],\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Pi_t\\) is the lattice meet in the corresponding lattice.\n\nThe Belnap matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) considered above also can be\nrepresented as a partially ordered valuation system. The set of truth\nvalues \\(\\{\\mathbf{N}, \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{B}\\}\\) from\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) constitutes a specific algebraic structure \u2013\nthe bilattice FOUR\\(_2\\) presented in Figure 3 (see, e.g.,\nGinsberg 1988, Arieli and Avron 1996, Fitting 2006).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The bilattice\nFOUR\\(_2\\)\n\n\nThis bilattice is equipped with two partial orderings; in\naddition to a truth order, there is an information order \\((\\le_i )\\)\nwhich is said to order the values under consideration according to the\ninformation they give concerning a formula to which they are assigned.\nLattice meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) coincide with the\nfunctions \\(f_{\\wedge}\\) and \\(f_{\\vee}\\) in the Belnap matrix\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\), \\(f_{{\\sim}}\\) turns out to be the truth order\ninversion, and an entailment relation, which happens to coincide with\nthe matrix entailment, is defined by\n (8).\n FOUR\\(_2\\) arises as a combination of two structures: the\napproximation lattice \\(A_4\\) and the logical lattice \\(L_4\\) which\nare discussed in Belnap 1977a and 1977b (see also, Anderson, Belnap\nand Dunn 1992: 510\u2013518)).\n",
