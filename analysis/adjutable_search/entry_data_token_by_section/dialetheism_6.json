    "main_text": "Motivations for Dialetheism || The Paradoxes of Self-Reference\n3.1 The Paradoxes of Self-Reference\n\nProbably the master argument used by modern dialetheists invokes the\nlogical\n paradoxes of self-reference.\n It is customary to distinguish between two families of such\nparadoxes: semantic and set-theoretic. The former family typically\ninvolves such concepts as truth, denotation,\ndefinability, etc; the latter, such notions as\nmembership, cardinality, etc. After\nG\u00f6del\u2019s and Tarski\u2019s well known formal procedures to\nobtain non-contextual self-reference in formalized languages, it is\ndifficult to draw a sharp line between the two families, among other\nthings, because of the fact that Tarskian semantics is itself framed\nin set-theoretic terms. Nevertheless, the distinction is commonly\naccepted within the relevant literature.\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox\n is the most famous of the set-theoretic paradoxes; it arises when one\nconsiders the set of all non self-membered sets, the Russell\nset.\n Cantor\u2019s paradox\n arises in connection with the universal set. The most famous of the\nsemantic paradoxes is the\n Liar paradox.\n Although cases for the existence of dialetheias can be made from\nalmost any paradox of self-reference, we will focus only on the Liar,\ngiven that it is the most easily understandable and its exposition\nrequires no particular technicalities.\n",
