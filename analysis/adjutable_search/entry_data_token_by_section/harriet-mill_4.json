    "main_text": "Taylor Mill as Author || Principles of Political Economy\n3.2 Principles of Political Economy\n\nMill suggests that Taylor Mill was deeply involved in the composition\nof three works of greater philosophical significance than those\ndiscussed above. The earliest is the Principles of Political\nEconomy. The Principles\u2019 subtitle is With Some\nof their Applications to Social Philosophy. At least a third of\nthe volume is concerned with topics that belong as much to philosophy\nas to economics, including the portion of the work that Harriet did\nthe most to shape, a chapter titled \u201cOn the Probable Futurity of\nthe Labouring Classes\u201d (J. S. Mill, [PPE], 758\u201396). This\nchapter argues that when the laboring class has made sufficient moral\nand intellectual progress, its members will refuse to settle for mere\nwages any longer. They will instead insist first on profit-sharing and\nlater on employee ownership of firms. They will even experiment with\nSocialist and Communist communities of the sorts depicted by\nSaint-Simon, Fourier, Blanc, and Owen. Mill\u2019s\nAutobiography states that\n\nIn the first draft of the book, that chapter did not exist. She\npointed out the need of such a chapter, and the extreme imperfection\nof the book without it: she was the cause of my writing it; and the\nmore general part of the chapter, the statement and discussion of the\ntwo opposite theories respecting the proper condition of the labouring\nclasses, was wholly an exposition of her thoughts, often in words\ntaken from her own lips. The purely scientific part of the Political\nEconomy I did not learn from her; but it was chiefly her influence\nthat gave to the book that general tone by which it is distinguished\nfrom all previous expositions of Political Economy that had any\npretension to being scientific, and which has made it so useful in\nconciliating minds which those previous expositions had\nrepelled\u2026. The economic generalizations which depend, not on\nnecessities of nature but on those combined with the existing\narrangements of society, it deals with only as provisional, and as\nliable to be much altered by the progress of social improvement. I had\nindeed partially learnt this view of things from the thoughts awakened\nin me by the speculations of the St. Simonians; but it was made a\nliving principle pervading and animating the book by my wife\u2019s\npromptings. ([ALE], 255\u20137)\n\n\nAs Jacobs reads this passage, Mill is declaring the chapter \u201cto\nbe written primarily by Taylor Mill\u201d (2002, 207\u20138). This\ngloss, though, seems to overlook his statement that \u201cshe was the\ncause of my writing it.\u201d Moreover, the aforementioned\n\u201cforbidden dedication\u201d of the volume refers without\nqualification to Mill as the author.\n\nTo Mrs. John Taylor, as the most eminently qualified of all persons\nknown to the author either to originate or appreciate speculations on\nsocial improvement, this attempt to explain and diffuse ideas many of\nwhich were first learned from herself, is with the highest respect and\nregard, dedicated. (J. S. Mill, [PPE], 1026n2)\n\n\nEven if the decision to put only Mill\u2019s name on the cover of the\nPrinciples could be explained as an expedient to win greater\nacceptance for the ideas within, there would have been little harm in\ndescribing her as its co-author in this dedication if she were such,\nespecially once the decision was made only to paste it inside copies\nof the Principles given to personal friends. On the other\nhand, though, his annotated bibliography does describe the\nPrinciples as a \u201cjoint production with my wife\u201d\n(MacMinn et al. 1945,\n 69).[4]\n And Taylor Mill was actively involved in revising portions of the\nlater editions of the Principles. For example, the second\n(1849) edition is considerably more favorable to Socialism and even\nCommunism, and the impetus for this shift seems to have been a change\nin Taylor Mill\u2019s thinking. In a letter written to Taylor Mill\nearly in 1849, Mill points out that she now \u201chad marked\ndissent\u201d from a passage in the first edition raising an\nobjection to Communism that \u201cwas inserted on your proposition\n& very nearly in your own words.\u201d He continues, though,\nthat\n\nThis is probably only the progress we have always been making, &\nby thinking sufficiently I should probably come to think the\nsame\u2014as is almost always the case, I believe always when we\nthink long enough. (J. S. Mill, [TLL], 8\u20139)\n\n\nThus while we can be confident that one important chapter of the\nPrinciples would not exist if not for Taylor Mill and that\nshe helped to edit other chapters, it is unclear whether her role in\nthe volume\u2019s composition was substantial enough to merit calling\nher its co-author. It is not even entirely clear whether John thought\nof her as such, and if he did, whether this was true from the start or\na retrospective judgment that he came to hold years\n later.[5]\n",
