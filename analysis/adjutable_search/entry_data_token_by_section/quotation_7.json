    "main_text": "Five Theories of Quotation\n3. Five Theories of Quotation\n\nThere are, roughly, five kinds of theories of quotation that have been\ncentral to the discussion of quotation: the Proper Name Theory, the\nDescription Theory, the Demonstrative/Paratactic Theory, the\nDisquotational Theory, and the Use/Identity Theory. (See here\nMaier\u2019s taxonomy (2014b), which just includes the first four\ntheories, and which evaluates them according in terms of formal\ndesiderata like compositionality and productivity, and cf. Saka 2013,\nwhich includes ten. This divergence, incidentally, is a good\nillustration of the point we made above about lack of consensus among\ntheorists of quotation.) In the following sections we discuss each of\nthese and review their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
