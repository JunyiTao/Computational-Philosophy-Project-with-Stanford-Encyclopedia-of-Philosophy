Take the property of being a referring expression, for\nexample. We have spoken about whether descriptions are referring\nexpressions or not, but perhaps it is incorrect to suppose that there\nare dedicated referring expressions in natural language. Ahn (2019)\nargues that what is called on to refer can vary greatly in natural\nlanguage, and that what expressions are deployed in order to refer\ndepends on what else is available to do the job. She proposes a\n\u201ccompetition mechanism\u201d which determines which expression\nmight be deployed in order to refer to something.\u00a0 In some cases\nit might be a name, in some a demonstrative, in some a pronoun, and in\nsome a description.\u00a0 It depends on which expression wins the\ncompetition in that setting. What this means, if correct, is that the\njob of reference would not be associated with a single type of\nsyntactic object, but with a large array of syntactic objects. In a\nsimilar vein, Ludlow and \u017divanovic (2022) have suggested that what\ncounts as quantificational may not be a property of individual\nmorphological items, but is more likely a global structural\nproperty.\u00a0 In this instance, the definite and indefinite\ndeterminers play more of a role as structure builders and not as\nindividual operators. The kind of quantificational structure that\nemerges would be a function of the surrounding syntactic objects.\n\nIt could also be the case that syntactic objects like the definite and\nindefinite determiners may not even be as syntactically simple as they\nappear.\u00a0 As noted above, Schwarz (2009) observed that there are\nlanguages in which morphologically distinct words are used to express\nuniqueness and familiarity. Following Stake (2009) and others working\nin \u201cnanosyntax,\u201d this would create some pressure to say\nthat the definite determiner in English might not be a single\nfunctional head, but is \u201csmeared\u201d across a larger phrase\nstructure that has separate functional heads for expressing uniqueness\nand familiarity.\u00a0 The English\u00a0determiner ends up being\nexploded across the phrase structure.\n",
