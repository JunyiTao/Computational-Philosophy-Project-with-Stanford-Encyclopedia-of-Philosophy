    "main_text": "Influence on Philosophical Debates || Culture and Epistemology\n4.5 Culture, Intuition, and Philosophical Methodology\n\nContemporary philosophy that is considered Western is recognized as\nsuch in virtue of tracing its origins back to a particular\ngeographical region, centered especially in Athens and Rome, but also\nin virtue of a shared body of topics and methods. Appreciation of\nhuman cultural and cognitive diversity can fuel the suspicion that\nmany topics worthy of philosophical consideration have been given less\nattention than they deserve by the Western tradition. This, in turn,\ncan be used to support the case that more Western philosophers should\nbranch out, exploring comparative projects and studying other\ntraditions (Van Norden 2017, also see Coseru 2009 [2017]; Outlaw 2010\n[2017]; Vargas 2007; Kasulis 2019; Wong 2001 [2020]; M\u00f8llgaard\n2021).\n\nWithin the Western tradition, arguments from cultural and cognitive\ndiversity have come to loom large in debates about philosophical\nmethodology. Some have pointed out that many traditions use approaches\nthat seem alien to contemporary Western philosophy, such as meditation\nor syncretism (McLeod 2016, also see Struck 2016 for a case that\ndivination was taken seriously by ancient Greek philosophers, and\nJones 2001 for an argument that philosophical methods are universal).\nMost discussions in this area, however, have centered on intuitions,\nand their character, distribution across populations, and proper role\nin philosophical theorizing (also see Pust 2012 [2019])\n\nSince the early 2000s, experimental philosophers have gathered their\nown data and used it to support a variety of projects (Sytsma &\nLivengood 2016; Knobe & Nichols 2017). One of the most prominent\nhas tried to develop arguments showing how diversity\u2014in culture,\nin cognition, and especially in philosophical intuition\u2014presents\nchallenges to philosophers who rely too heavily on appeals to their\nown intuitions, or solely on the intuitions of a select few (Egler\nforthcoming). Intuitions about philosophical issues may vary in ways\nthat raise doubts about the significance of projects that fail to take\naccount of such variation. As an early manifesto put it:\n\n\nSince it\u2019s in some sense an accident that I had the cultural\nupbringing that I did, I am forced to wonder whether my intuitions are\nsuperior at tracking the nature of the world, the mind, and the good.\n(Knobe & Nichols 2008, 11; also see DiPaolo & Simpson 2016;\nAndow 2016)\n\n\nConclusions reached mainly on the basis of \u2018close to home\u2019\nintuitions may be relative and limited in scope, the argument goes, as\nphilosophers in other cultures and with other intuitions may\nrationally arrive at different or even contrasting conclusions.\n\nThe empirical situation as revealed by experimental philosophy,\nhowever, is far from simple or straightforward. Initial efforts\npresented evidence of diversity in the intuitive judgments people from\ndifferent groups made about the moral, epistemic, and semantic\nfeatures of a range of scenarios. For example, one of the first\nexperimental philosophy studies found that East Asian participants\nexhibited markedly different responses than Westerner participants to\nthe kinds of Gettier cases commonly used by analytic epistemologists\n(Weinberg, Nichols, & Stich 2001). Similarly, the first\ncross-cultural study of semantic intuitions about reference, which\nused scenarios based on Kripke\u2019s famous G\u00f6del-case, again\nfound evidence of interesting differences between East Asian and\nWestern participants (Machery, Mallon, et al. 2004).\n\nSome, but not all, of these results have replicated (Cova, Strickland,\net al. 2021). While later studies seemed to confirm that semantic\nintuitions differ cross-culturally (Beebe & Undercoffer 2016; van\nDongen et al. 2021), subsequent research has indicated there may be\ncross-cultural convergence on Gettier-cases and other epistemic\nintuitions (Kim & Yuan 2015; Machery, Stich, et al. 2017; Yuan\n& Kim forthcoming; but see Waterman et al., 2018; S\u0119kowski et\nal. forthcoming). Empirical research on intuitions about free will has\nrevealed another messy picture, with some work suggesting that many\nyoung Americans have compatibilist intuitions (Nahmias et al. 2006),\nwhile other studies find evidence of convergence, with participants\nfrom different cultures embracing incompatibilism and rejecting\ndeterminism (Sarkissian et al. 2010). Other research suggests that\npeople in Asia tend to make judgments about free will that\nsystematically differ from the judgments in the rest of the world\n(Hannikainen et al. 2019). Investigation into aesthetic intuitions\nfound that participants across cultures broadly agree that aesthetic\njudgments are subjective and not universally valid, though there is\nevidence of patterns of differences in detail (Cova, Garcia, &\nLiao 2015).\n\nPhilosophers continue to debate the implications of this complicated\nand evolving empirical picture. Some have explored how such evidence\nmay be put to use by experimental philosophers engaged in positive\nsubstantive projects of explication and conceptual engineering\n(Shepherd & Justus 2015; Schupbach 2017; Nado 2021). Even when\nintuitions about philosophical cases do not significantly vary,\nsystematic investigation of them may still yield important evidence in\nthe analysis of concepts (Stich & Tobia 2016, also see Knobe 2016\nand Machery 2017).\n\nThe empirical picture has been interpreted by advocates of more\ntraditional (Western) methods to support those methods. Some have\ngiven a close analysis of the nature and use of intuitions, and\ndefended the perhaps surprisingly view that even if they do exhibit\npatterns of cross-cultural variation, it would be irrelevant to\nphilosophical methodology because intuitions play only a minor role in\nphilosophical argumentation (Cappelen 2012, also see Ichikawa, Maitra,\n& Weatherson 2012). Others have accepted that intuitions are\nimportant to philosophical methodology, but argued that the empirical\nrecord does not reflect enough variation, or the right kind of\nvariation, to be philosophically troubling (Knobe 2019; cf. Stich\n& Machery forthcoming). Some have been most impressed with the\ndiscovered uniformity, arguing that it deflates experimental\nphilosophy\u2019s diversity-based methodological challenge (Ichikawa\n2012).\n\nAnother line of response to the challenge focuses on the details in\nthe patterns of variation, arguing that the revealed diversity is\noften superficial or philosophically toothless (Sosa 2009), or that\ndisagreement suggested by the presence of conflicting intuitions would\nusually disappear if the individuals from different cultures could\ndiscuss cases or provide justifications for their intuitions (Deutsch\n2010). Debates about one such response, which has become known as the\nexpertise defense, consider in detail the possibility that some\ninstances of variation are innocuous. Some people\u2019s intuitions,\nspecifically those people with special expertise or training, are more\nsensitive to philosophical issues. Thus, not only should differences\nbetween lay people and experts to be expected, but, continues the\nargument, the intuitions of the experts deserve more evidential weight\nin philosophizing (Devitt 2011; Williamson 2011; also see Horvath\n& Koch 2021). This defense, claim its critics, relies on what\nappear to be questionable empirical assumptions about experts and\ntheir intuitions (Weinberg, Gonnerman, et al. 2010; Schwitzgebel &\nCushman 2015; Wiegmann, Horvath, & Meyer 2020; Horvath &\nWiegmann forthcoming). One response that is particularly intriguing\nfor those interested in cognition and cultural variation is that the\nintuitions of experts\u2014trained philosophers\u2014seem to vary\nquite dramatically according to their linguistic background (Vaesen,\nPeterson, & Van Bezooijen 2013). These debates continue. No one,\nhowever, has argued against the idea that reflection on cultural\ndiversity in worldviews, values, conceptualizations, cognition, or\nintuition can be philosophically valuable in ways that go far beyond\ntheir relevance to debates about methodology.\n",
