    "main_text": "The Argument From the Analysis of Knowledge || Closure and Reliabilism\n2.3 Closure and Reliabilism\n\nOn one version of reliabilism (defended by Ramsey 1931 and Armstrong\n1973, among others) one knows p if and only if one arrives at\n(or sustains) the belief p via a reliable method. Is the\nreliabilist committed to K? The answer depends on precisely\nhow the relevant notion of reliability is understood. If we understand\nreliability as tracking theorists do, we will reject closure. But\nthere are other versions of reliabilism which sustain K. For\nexample, the safe indication account is a type of reliabilism. Also,\nwe could say that a true belief p is reliably formed if and\nonly if based on an event that usually would occur only if\np (or a p-type belief) were true. Any event that, in\nthis sense, reliably indicates that p is true will also\nreliably indicate that p\u2019s consequences are true.\n",
