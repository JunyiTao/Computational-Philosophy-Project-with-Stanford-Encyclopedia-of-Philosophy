Kuhn\u2019s Early Account of Scientific Revolutions\n\nAlthough virtually no one in the science studies fields accepts\nKuhn\u2019s model in Structure as correct in detail, there\nhas been a revival of interest in his views since his death and, more\nrecently, in connection with the fiftieth anniversary in 2012 of the\nbook\u2019s original publication. Some examples are: the fiftieth\nanniversary edition of Structure itself, including a valuable\nintroduction by Ian Hacking; Kuhn (2000a), a collection that records\nthe later evolution of Kuhn\u2019s thought; Sankey (1997); Bitbol\n(1997); Fuller (2000); Bird (2001); Friedman (2001); Andersen (2001);\nSharrock and Read (2002); Nickles (2003a); Gonz\u00e1lez (2004);\nSoler et al. (2008); Agazzi (2008); Gattei (2008); Torres (2010); Wray\n(2011), Kindi and Arabatzis (2012), De Langhe (2013), Marcum (2015),\nand Richards and Daston (2016). Kuhn on revolutions has helped to\nshape many symposia on scientific realism and related matters, for\nexample, Soler (2008) on contingency in the historical development of\nscience and Rowbottom and Bueno (2011) on Bas van Fraassen\u2019s\n(2002) treatment of stance, voluntarism, and the viability of\nempiricism. Since Kuhn\u2019s work is discussed in some detail in\nother contributions to this Encyclopedia (see, especially,\n\u201cKuhn, Thomas\u201d, and \u201cThe Incommensurability of\nScientific Theories\u201d), a brief account will suffice here. For a\ndetailed reading guide to Structure, consult Preston\n(2008).\n3.1 Kuhn\u2019s Early Model of Scientific Development\n\nAccording to Kuhn in Structure, a loosely characterized group\nof activities, often consisting of competing schools, becomes a mature\nscience when a few concrete problem solutions provide models for what\ngood research is (or can be) in that domain. These exemplary\nproblems-cum-solutions become the basis of a \u201cparadigm\u201d\nthat defines what it is to do \u201cnormal science.\u201d As its\nname suggests, normal science is the default state of a mature science\nand of the community of researchers who constitute it. The paradigm\ninforms investigators what their domain of the world is like and\npractically guarantees that all legitimate problems can be solved in\nits terms. Normal science is convergent rather than divergent: it\nactively discourages revolutionary initiatives and essentially novel\n(unexpected) discoveries, for these threaten the paradigm. However,\nnormal research is so detailed and focused that it is bound to turn up\nanomalous experimental and theoretical results, some of which will\nlong resist the best attempts to resolve them. Given the historical\ncontingencies involved in the formation of guiding paradigms as well\nas the fallibility of all investigators, it would be incredibly\nimprobable for everything to end up working perfectly. According to\nKuhn, anomalies are therefore to be expected. Historically, all\nparadigms and theory complexes face anomalies at all times. If and\nwhen persistent efforts by the best researchers fail to resolve the\nanomalies, the community begins to lose confidence in the paradigm and\na crisis period ensues in which serious alternatives can now be\nentertained. If one of these alternatives shows sufficient promise to\nattract a dominant group of leading researchers away from the old\nparadigm, a paradigm shift or paradigm change occurs\u2014and that is\na Kuhnian revolution. The radicals accomplish this by replacing the\nformer set of routine problems and problem-solving techniques\n(exemplars) by a new set of exemplars, making the old practices seem\ndefective, or at least old fashioned.\n3.2 Revolution as Incommensurable Paradigm Change\n\nThe new paradigm overturns the old by displacing it as no longer a\ncompetent guide to future research. In the famous (or\nnotorious)chapter X of Structure, Kuhn claims that the change\nis typically so radical that the two paradigms cannot be compared\nagainst the same goals and methodological standards and values.\nMoreover, the accompanying meaning shift of key terms, such as\n\u2018simultaneous\u2019, \u2018mass\u2019, and\n\u2018force\u2019 in physics, leads to communication breakdown. In\neffect, scientists on different sides of a paradigm debate \u201clive\nin different worlds.\u201d Kuhn speaks of scientists experiencing a\nkind of gestalt switch or religious conversion experience. The heated\nrhetoric of debate and the resulting social reorganization, he says,\nresemble those of a political revolution. \u201cLike the choice\nbetween political institutions, that between competing paradigms\nproves to be a choice between incompatible modes of community\nlife\u201d (1970, 94). The comparison of scientific with political\nrevolutions should not surprise, given the entangled history of the\nterm \u2018revolution\u2019, but claiming such close similarity\nenraged philosophical and cultural critics of Kuhn.\n\nThe typical paradigm change does not involve a large infusion of new\nempirical results, Kuhn tells us (chs. IX and X). Rather, it is a\nconceptual reorganization of otherwise familiar materials, as in the\nrelativity revolution. A paradigm change typically changes goals,\nstandards, linguistic meaning, key scientific practices, the way both\nthe technical content and the relevant specialist community are\norganized, and the way scientists perceive the world. (For the often\nneglected practices dimension in Kuhn\u2019s account, see Rouse,\n2003.) Nor can we retain the old, linear, cumulative conception of\nscientific progress characteristic of Enlightenment thinking; for,\nKuhn insists, attempts to to show that the new paradigm contains the\nold, either logically or in some limit or under some approximation,\nwill be guilty of a fallacy of equivocation. The meaning change\nreflects the radical change in the assumed ontology of the world. A\nsecond Kuhnian objection to cumulative progress is what has come to be\ncalled \u201cKuhn loss\u201d (see Post 1971, 229, n. 38). Rarely\ndoes the new paradigm solve all of the problems that its predecessor\napparently solved. So even in this sense the new paradigm fails\ncompletely to enclose the old. The consequence, according to Kuhn, is\nthat attempts to defend continuous, cumulative scientific progress by\nmeans of theory reduction or even a correspondence relationship (e.g.,\na limiting relationship) between a theory and its predecessor must\nfail. Revolutions produce discontinuities.\n\nGiven all these changes, Kuhn claimed that the two competing paradigms\nare \u201cincommensurable\u201d, a technical term that he repeatedly\nattempted to clarify. Traditional appeals to empirical results and\nlogical argument are insufficient to resolve the debate. For details\nof the incommensurability debate, see the entry \u201cThe\nIncommensurability of Scientific Theories.\u201d as well as\nHoyningen-Huene and Sankey (2001) as a sample of the large literature\non incommensurability.\n\nNaturally, many thinkers of a logical empiricist or Popperian bent, or\nsimply of an Enlightenment persuasion, were shocked by these claims\nand responded with a barrage of criticism\u2014as if Kuhn had\ncommitted a kind of sacrilege by defiling the only human institution\nthat could be trusted to provide the objective truth about the world.\nToday there is fairly wide agreement that some of Kuhn\u2019s claims\nno longer look so radical. Meanwhile, Kuhn himself was equally shocked\nby the vehemence of the attacks and (to his mind) the willful\ndistortion of his views (see, e.g., Lakatos and Musgrave 1970). In\nlater papers and talks, he both clarified his views and softened some\nof his more radical claims. Critics reacted to the radical views of\nPaul Feyerabend (1962, 1975) in a somewhat similar manner. (For\ndetails, see the entry \u201cFeyerabend, Paul.\u201d)\n\nGiven that cyclic theories of history have, for the most part, long\ngiven way to linear, progressive accounts, readers may be surprised at\nKuhn critic, physicist Stephen Weinberg\u2019s comment that\nKuhn\u2019s overall model is still, in a sense, cyclic (Weinberg\n2001). In fact, Kuhn himself had already recognized this. After the\nfounding paradigm in Kuhn\u2019s account in Structure, we\nhave normal science under a paradigm, then crisis, then revolution,\nthen a new paradigm\u2014a development that brings back a new period\nof normal science. At this abstract level of description, the model is\nindeed cyclic, but of course the new paradigm heads the science in\nquestion in a new direction rather than returning it to a previous\nstate. Other commentators, including Marxists, have regarded\nKuhn\u2019s mechanism as dialectical, as illustrated by the\nsuccession of self-undermining developments in the theory of light,\nfrom a Newtonian particle theory to a wave theory to a new kind of\nwave-particle duality. (For the dialectical interpretation see\nespecially Krajewski 1977 and Nowak 1980 on the idealizational\napproach to science, as originated by Karl Marx.)\n\nSomewhat ironically, Kuhn\u2019s attempt to revolutionize the\nepistemology of science has had a wider socio-cultural impact than\nmany scientific revolutions themselves. While some of Kuhn\u2019s\ndoctrines step into the postmodern era, he still had a foot in the\nEnlightenment, which helps to explain his dismay at the critical\nreaction to his work and to radical developments in the new-wave\nsociology of science of the 1970s and \u201880s. For, unlike many\npostmodernists (some of whom make use of his work), Kuhn retained a\nscientific exceptionalism. He did not doubt that the sciences have\nbeen uniquely successful since the Scientific Revolution. For him,\nunlike for many of his critics, revolutions in his radical sense were\ngreat epistemological leaps forward rather than deep scientific\nfailures. On the science policy front, he intended his work to help\npreserve the integrity of this socially valuable enterprise. It is on\nscience policy issues that Steve Fuller is most critical of Kuhn\n(Fuller 2000).\n\nThe general problem presented by Kuhn\u2019s critique of traditional\nphilosophy of science is that, although the various sciences have been\nsuccessful, we do not understand how they have accomplished\nthis or even how to characterize this success. Enlightenment-style\nexplanations have failed. For example, Kuhn and Feyerabend (1975),\npreceded by Popper, were among the first philosophers to expose the\nbankruptcy of the claim that it was the discovery of a special\nscientific method that explains that success, a view that is still\nwidely taught in secondary schools today. And that conclusion (one\nthat cheered those postmodernists who regard scientific progress as an\nillusion) left Kuhn and the science studies profession with the\nproblem of how science really does work. To explain how and why it had\nbeen so successful became an urgent problem for him\u2014again, a\nproblem largely rejected as bogus by many science studies scholars\nother than philosophers. \n\nAnother of Kuhn\u2019s declared tasks in Structure was to\nsolve the problem of social order for mature science, that is, how\ncohesive modern science (especially normal science) is possible\n(Barnes 1982, 2003). Yet another was to bring scientific discovery\nback into philosophical discussion by endogenizing it in his model,\nwhile denying the existence of a logic of discovery. Whereas\nthe logical empiricists and Popper had excluded discovery issues from\nphilosophy of science in favor of theory of confirmation or\ncorroboration, Kuhn was critical of confirmation theory and supportive\nof historical and philosophical work on discovery. He argued that\ndiscoveries are temporally and cognitively structured and that they\nare an essential component of an epistemology of science. In Kuhnian\nnormal science the problems are so well structured and the solutions\nso nearly guaranteed in terms of the resources of the paradigm that\nthe problems reduce to puzzles (Nickles 2003b). Kuhn kept things under\ncontrol there by denying that normal scientists seek essential\ninnovation, for, as indicated above, major, unexpected discoveries\nthreaten the extant paradigm and hence threaten crisis and revolution.\nSo, even in normal science, Kuhn had to admit that major discoveries\nare unexpected challenges to the reigning paradigm. They are\nanomalous, even exogenous in the sense that they come as shocks from\noutside the normal system.\n\nBut this is the working scientists\u2019 point of view. As noted,\nnormal science is bound to turn up difficulties that resist\nresolution, at least some of which are sooner or later recognized by\nthe community. In Kuhn\u2019s own view, as a historian and\nphilosopher standing high above the fray, it is deliberate, systematic\nnormal research that will most readily sow the seeds of revolution and\nhence of rapid scientific progress. According to the old\nmusicians\u2019 joke, the fastest way to Carnegie Hall is slow\npractice. For Kuhn the fastest way to revolutionary innovation is\nintensely detailed normal science.\n\nWhen it comes to revolution on Kuhn\u2019s account, the social order\nbreaks down dramatically. And here his strategy of taming creative\nnormal research so as to make room for articulated discovery (the\nreduction of research problems to puzzles) also breaks down. Kuhn had\nto acknowledge that he had no idea how the scientists in extraordinary\nresearch contexts manage to come up with brilliant new ideas and\ntechniques. This failure exacerbated his problem of explaining what\nsort of continuity underlies the revolutionary break that enables us\nto identify the event as a revolution within an ongoing field of\ninquiry. As he later wrote:\n\nEven those who have followed me this far will want to know how a\nvalue-based enterprise of the sort I have described can develop as a\nscience does, repeatedly producing powerful new techniques for\nprediction and control. To that question, unfortunately, I have no\nanswer at all\u2026. [1977b, 332]\n\n3.3 Progress through Revolutions\n\nKuhn\u2019s work on scientific revolutions raises difficult questions\nabout whether science progresses and, if so, in what that progress\nconsists. Kuhn asks (p. 60), \u201cWhy is progress a perquisite\nreserved almost exclusively for the activities we call science\u201d\nand not for art, political theory, or philosophy? Early critics took\nhim to deny scientific progress, because he rejected the traditional\ncorrespondence theory of truth and the related idea of cumulative\nprogress toward a representational truth waiting out there for science\nto find it. For Kuhn the internalist, the technical goals of science\nare endogenously generated and change over time, rapidly during\nrevolutions. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, Kuhn regarded revolutions as\nthe most progressive components of his model of science.\nUnfortunately, he was not able to articulate fully in what that\nprogress consists, given the issues of truth, incommensurability and\nKuhn loss, a problem that those who reject convergent scientific\nrealism still face. However, problem-solving know-how and success,\nincluding predictive precision, are major components of his answer.\n\u201c[T]he unit of scientific achievement is the solved\nproblem....\u201d (p. 169). In a retreat from his most radical\nstatements, Kuhn responded to critics by saying that we do possess a\ngeneral set of scientific values that enables us, usually pretty\neasily, to order scientific works in historical time according to the\ndegree in which they realize these values. A new paradigm, he says,\nmust always treat successfully a serious anomaly left by the old one\nas well as opening up new questions for fruitful investigation.\n\nKuhn\u2019s emphasis on scientific practices, relative to the\nphilosophical state of play in the 1960s, takes up some of the slack\nleft by the rejection of strong realism. His emphasis on skilled\npractice may have been influenced by Michael Polanyi\u2019s\nPersonal Knowledge (1958), with its \u201ctacit\nknowing\u201d component, although Kuhn denied that he found\nPolanyi\u2019s account appealing (see, e.g., Baltas et al., 2000, pp.\n296f).\n\nIf there have been so many revolutions, then why did the world have to\nwait for Kuhn to see them? Because, he said, they are largely\ninvisible. For, after a revolution, the winners rewrite the history of\nscience to make it look as if the present paradigm is the brilliant\nbut rational sequel to previous work. The implication is that only\nsomeone of Kuhn\u2019s historical sensitivity could be expected to\nnotice this. (Skeptical critics reply that Kuhn invented the problem\nfor which he had a solution.) Indeed, in his large book on the history\nof the early quantum theory (Kuhn 1978), he moved the origin of the\nquantum theory revolution forward five years, from Planck in 1900 to\nEinstein and Ehrenfest in 1905. Revisionist historiography by whiggish\nscientists, he claimed, had smoothed out the actual history by\ncrediting Planck with a solution that he actually rejected at the time\nto a problem that he did not then have\u2014and by diminishing the\ntruly radical contribution of Einstein. Kuhn\u2019s move again raises\nthe question whether the authors of a revolution must knowingly break\nfrom the received research tradition.\n3.4 Revolution or Evolution?\n\nAt the end of Structure, Kuhn drew an analogy between the\ndevelopment of science and evolutionary biology. This was surprising,\nsince \u2018evolution\u2019 is commonly employed as a contrast term\nto \u2018revolution\u2019. Kuhn\u2019s main point was that\nevolution ramifies rather than progressing toward a final goal, yet\nits degree of specialization through speciation can be regarded as a\nsort of progress, a progress from a historically existing\nbenchmark rather than a progress toward a preordained,\nspeculative goal. So specialization is an indicator of progress. As\nfor revolutions, they correspond to macromutations.\n\nThe process described in Section XII as the resolution of revolutions\nis the selection by conflict within the scientific community of the\nfittest way to practice future science. The net result of a sequence\nof such revolutionary selections, separated by periods of normal\nresearch, is the wonderfully adapted set of instruments we call modern\nscientific knowledge. Successive stages in that developmental process\nare marked by an increase in articulation and specialization. And the\nentire process may have occurred, as we now suppose biological\nevolution did, without benefit of a set goal\u2026 . [1970, 172f]\n\n\nAt the time, it was striking that Kuhn compared revolutionary\ntransitions, rather than normal scientific developments, with\nevolutionary change. It seems clear that he did not consider\nrevolution and evolution to be mutually incompatible. But keep in mind\nthat, for him, normal science represents periods of stasis, whereas\nrevolutions are short, highly creative periods that more closely\nresemble the exploration by random trial and error (p. 87) that we\nassociate with biological evolution. Examined on a minute time scale,\nhowever, normal science arguably also involves a (more constrained)\nvariation and selection process, as scientific practitioners search\nfor ways to articulate the paradigm. So, given the inevitability of\nevolution under such conditions, Kuhn\u2019s treatment of normal\nscience would appear to be too static. The important point here is\nthat, in Kuhn\u2019s view revolution and evolution are compatible\nwhen considered on the correct time scales (see Wray 2011 and\nKuukkanen 2012). Examined from afar, revolutions are simply the more\nnoteworthy episodes in the evolution of the sciences. Examined up\nclose, they (like discoveries in general for Kuhn) have a detailed\nstructure that is evolutionary, even something as revolutionary as the\nquantum theory (Kuhn 1978).\n\nBut how, then, the reader is entitled to ask, can Kuhn accommodate the\nsharp discontinuities that he advertised in chapter X of the book? We\ncannot equate revolutions simply with speciation in Darwin\u2019s own\nsense, given that Darwin\u2019s favorite mechanism of speciation was\nanagenesis, not cladogenesis\u2014just the long-term gradual\nevolution within a single line rather than the splitting of lines.\nInterestingly, the later Kuhn will opt for cladogenesis.\n\nAs many commentators have pointed out, the theory of punctuated\nequilibrium of Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (1992) raises the\nquestion of evolution versus revolution, now precisely in the\nbiological (paleontological) context. In fact, Gould and Eldredge were\nthemselves influenced by Kuhn, whom Gould once described as \u201ca\ndear friend\u201d; but they denied that they had deliberately\nfashioned themselves as Kuhnian revolutionaries (Gould 1997). Gould\nand Eldredge end their later review article on punctuated equilibrium\nby remarking:\n\n[C]ontemporary science has massively substituted notions of\nindeterminacy, historical contingency, chaos and punctuation for\nprevious convictions about gradual, progressive, predictable\ndeterminism. These transitions have occurred in field after field;\nKuhn\u2019s celebrated notion of scientific revolutions is, for\nexample, a punctuation theory for the history of scientific ideas.\n[1993, 227]\n\n\nHere, as with Kuhn, those who resist Gould\u2019s attempt to sound so\nrevolutionary as to be contrary to Darwin\u2019s phyletic gradualism\nnote that it is only on a geological timescale that such developments\nas the Cambrian explosion appear to be episodic. When examined on the\ntimescale of the biological generations of the life forms in question,\nthe development is evolutionary\u2014more rapid evolution than during\nother periods, to be sure, but still evolutionary.\n\nStuart Kauffman (1993) and Brian Goodwin (1994) defended\nreorganization in the form of self-organization as the primary\nmacro-biological mechanism, with evolutionary adaptation adding only\nthe finishing touches. Gould and Richard Lewontin had raised this\npossibility in their famous paper of 1979, \u201cThe Spandrels of San\nMarco and the Panglossian Paradigm.\u201d Applied to the development\nof science, this view implies that revolutions determine the overall\nshape, while ordinary scientific work applies the adaptive\nmicroevolution. Meanwhile, Michael Ruse (1989) defended the view that\nthe Darwinian paradigm (with its emphasis on function and adaptation)\nand the punctuated equilibrium paradigm (with its emphasis on Germanic\nideas of form and internal constraints) are complementary.\n\nDavid Hull ended his book, Science as a Process (1988), with\nthe remark that the book can be regarded as an attempt to fulfill both\nKuhn\u2019s and Toulmin\u2019s ambitions to provide a evolutionary\naccount of scientific development. Hull\u2019s is the most\nthoroughgoing attempt to date to provide an evolutionary account of\nscientific practice, at least in a specific field. However, nothing\nlike Kuhnian paradigms, normal science, and revolutions are to be\nfound in Hull\u2019s book, and this was deliberate on his part.\nWhereas Kuhn originally said that paradigms correspond one-to-one with\nscientific communities, Hull rejected Kuhn\u2019s idea of a\nscientific community as too loose. A scientific community, he said,\ndoes not consist of people who merely happen to agree on certain\nthings (anymore than the members of a species are individuals who\nhappen to share a set of traits). Mere consensus is not enough.\nRather, communities are tightly causally linked in the right sorts of\nways, just as species are. There is no community of biologists or even\nof evolutionary biologists but only a patchwork of cliques. It is\nhere, locally, that the seeds of innovation are sown, most of which\nare weeded out in a selective process by the larger group of\nspecialists. Hull\u2019s is a story of the socio-cultural evolution\nof science without revolution.\n4. Kuhn\u2019s Later Account of Scientific Revolutions\n\nIn \u201cThe Road Since Structure,\u201d his 1990 Presidential\nAddress to the Philosophy of Science Association, Kuhn reported on a\nbook in progress, a project that would remain unfinished at his death.\n(See also Kuhn 1993.) In this and other fragments of that work, he\ndevelops the biological metaphor broached at the end of\nStructure. He retains his old parallel to biological\nevolution, that science progresses or evolves away from its previous\nforms rather than toward a final truth about the world; but he now\nextends the biological analogy by regarding scientific specialties\nthemselves as akin to biological species that carve out research and\nteaching niches for themselves. In the process, he significantly\nmodifies his conception of scientific revolutions and attendant claims\nconcerning crises and incommensurable breaks. No longer do we hear of\nrevolutions as paradigm change, certainly not in the sense of large\nparadigms. In fact, Kuhn prefers to speak of \u201cdevelopmental\nepisodes\u201d instead of revolutions. However, he does retain\nsomething of his original idea of small paradigms, the concrete\nproblem solutions that he had termed \u201cexemplars\u201d in the\n\u201cPostscript-1969\u201d to Structure. Most revolutions,\nhe tells us, are not major discontinuities in which a successor theory\noverturns and replaces its predecessor. Rather, they are like\n(allopatric) biological speciation, in which a group of organisms\nbecomes reproductively isolated from the main population.\n\n\n[R]evolutions, which produce new divisions between fields in\nscientific development, are much like episodes of speciation in\nbiological evolution. The biological parallel to revolutionary change\nis not mutation, as I thought for many years, but speciation. And the\nproblems presented by speciation (e.g., the difficulty in identifying\nan episode of speciation until some time after it has occurred, and\nthe impossibility even then, of dating the time of its occurrence) are\nvery similar to those presented by revolutionary change and by the\nemergence and individuation of new scientific specialties.\n\u2026\n\nThough I greet the thought with mixed feelings, I am increasingly\npersuaded that the limited range of possible partners for fruitful\nintercourse is the essential precondition for what is known as\nprogress in both biological development and the development of\nknowledge. When I suggested earlier that incommensurability, properly\nunderstood, could reveal the source of the cognitive bite and\nauthority of the sciences, its role as an isolating mechanism was\nprerequisite to the topic I had principally in mind. \u2026 [Kuhn\n2000, 98\u201399]\n\n\nIn short, specialization is speciation, a scientific progress\nheightens communication breakdown. Experts doing similar kinds of\nresearch come to realize that their use of key taxonomic terms no\nlonger jibes with mainline usage, in the sense that what Kuhn calls\n\u201cthe no overlap principle\u201d is violated: the group is using\na taxonomic hierarchy for crucial kind terms and the associated\ncategories that is incompatible with that of the established\ntradition. The group splits off and forms a distinct specialty with\nits own professional journals, conferences, etc., while leaving the\nrest of the field largely intact. The incommensurability is now a\nlocal, community-licensed, taxonomic one that creates something of a\nbarrier to communication with neighboring specialties. One thinks, for\nexample, of the way different biological specialties employ the\nspecies concept itself, and the concept of gene. This linguistic\nsensitivity as a group identifier permits the kind of fullness of\ncommunication, both linguistic and practical, within the group that\nKuhn had stressed already in Structure and thus permits the\ngroup to progress more rapidly. This multiplication of specialties is\nthe key to Kuhn\u2019s new conception of scientific progress. Two\nrecent books that directly engage these issues are Andersen et al.\n(2006) and Wray (2011), the first from a cognitive science point of\nview, the second with emphasis on Kuhn\u2019s social epistemology.\nSee also Nersessian (2003, 2008) and Kuukkanen (2012).\n\nAnother striking fact about Kuhn\u2019s last project is the demotion\nto \u201ca historical perspective\u201d of the history of science as\na detailed source of data or phenomena upon which philosophers of\nscience should draw. While Structure was already a curious\nmix of an inductive, history-based, bottom-up approach to modeling\nscientific development and a more formal, top-down approach based on\nKuhn\u2019s Kantianism (see below), he now concludes that his core\nposition follows from first principles alone.\n\nWith much reluctance I have increasingly come to feel that this\nprocess of specialization, with its consequent limitation on\ncommunication and community, is inescapable, a consequence of first\nprinciples. Specialization and the narrowing of the range of expertise\nnow look to me like the necessary price of increasingly powerful\ncognitive tools. [2000, p. 98]\n\n\nThus Kuhn\u2019s new emphasis is on synchronic revolutions, in which\na field splits into subfields, rather than on the diachronic\nreplacement of one paradigm complex by another that his early account\nfeatured. His conception of a science is therefore less monolithic. A\nvibrant field such as evolutionary biology can tolerate several\ndistinct species concepts at the same time, a fact that contributes\nrather than detracts from its vibrancy. The overall result is a less\ntightly integrated, less dogmatic conception of normal science under\nan overarching paradigm, a view that has implications also for the\nnecessity and size of future revolutions. For no longer need an\nesoteric discrepancy get the leverage to trigger a crisis that\neventuates in the replacement of an entire, tightly integrated system.\nIn this respect, Kuhn\u2019s conception of physics becomes somewhat\ncloser to Godfrey-Smith\u2019s characterization of progress in\nbiology as \u201ca deluge\u201d rather than a full-scale Kuhnian\nrevolution (see below and Godfrey-Smith 2007). Given that progress in\nbiological evolution is better regarded as the remarkable\nproliferation of intricate, useful design rather than movement toward\na goal, the explicit parallels that Kuhn draws to biological evolution\nsuggest that he is moving toward the same conception of scientific\nprogress as some see in biological evolution\u2014as the\nproliferation of adaptive design. We may know more about his final\nposition once more of the book manuscript, left incomplete at his\ndeath, is published.\n5. Larger Formations and Historical A Prioris: The Germanic and French Traditions\n\nWe pass now from the smaller-scale revolutions of Kuhn\u2019s later\nwork to large-scale movements that, in several cases, exceed the\nbounds of the early Kuhnian paradigms and the revolutionary\ntransformations linking them. Other thinkers have gone even further\nthan Kuhn, by positing the existence of cognitive formations that are\nboth broader and deeper than his. One prominent line of thought here\nis the neo-Kantian one up through Reichenbach and Carnap, discussed\nand further developed by Michael Friedman (2001, 2003). Another, not\nentirely distinct, idea is that of a thought style or discursive\nformation found variously in such writers as Ludwik Fleck (1935),\nAlistair Crombie (1994), Michel Foucault (1969), and Ian Hacking\n(1990, 2002, 2012). Especially in the accounts of Foucault and\nHacking, new conceptual spaces are constructed and may\n\u201ccrystallize\u201d (Hacking) rapidly. Once they become\ncanonical, they seem to be such obvious frameworks for making true or\nfalse claims that the corresponding categories of thought and action\nappear to be given as part of the nature of things, as\nwritten in the language of nature, so to speak, when they are in fact\na product of the cultural conditioning of our socio-cognitive systems.\nIn the limit we project our deeply ingrained cultural categories not\nonly onto our world as we encounter it but also onto all\n(historically) conceivable worlds. The historical change in question,\nonce called to our attention, seems revolutionary\u2014in a manner\nthat is both broader and deeper than the transition to a new paradigm\nwithin a particular scientific specialty. Once again, the magnitude of\nthe change is practically invisible to all but the most sensitive\narcheologist of knowledge. Feyerabend was alive to this perspective in\nhis work on Galileo. But, unlike his treatment of the Copernican\nRevolution (Kuhn 1957), Kuhn\u2019s revolutions in Structure\nand beyond are more limited in scope, typically occurring more or less\nwholly within a single discipline. Nor is it obvious that the\nemergence of a new thought style must overturn a distinct predecessor.\nOf course, we should not regard social constructionist /\ndeconstructionist projects (whether or not deliberately designed) as,\nautomatically, ongoing, enlightened processes that\n\u201cunfreeze\u201d the stones inherited from the past; for it was\nthese very processes that created essentialist constructions in the\nfirst place. The claim is that our constructions today are no\ndifferent.\n\nThe four main characteristics of Hacking\u2019s \u201cbig\nrevolutions\u201d are that they lead to whole new interdisciplinary\ncomplexes, replete with new social institutions and corresponding\nsocial changes, and they alter that period\u2019s overall take on, or\n\u201cfeel\u201d for, the universe. For critical discussion of\nHacking on styles of reasoning, see Kusch (2010) and Scortino (2016).\nFor more on Hacking, see section 5.3 below.\n5.1 Thomas Kuhn: Kantian or Hegelian?\n\nKuhn several times described himself as \u201ca Kantian with moveable\ncategories.\u201d Hoyningen-Huene (1993) provides a broadly Kantian\ninterpretation of Kuhn (endorsed by Kuhn himself), as does Friedman\n(2001, 2003, 2010). Given the historical approach of\nStructure, other commentators have likened Kuhn to Hegel\ninstead of Kant. And given the early Kuhn\u2019s view that scientific\nreason is manifested more clearly in historical change as well as in\nnormal scientific practices than in symbolic logical structures,\nKuhn\u2019s early theory of scientific change can be termed very\nbroadly Hegelian. Also fitting the broadly Hegelian frame is\nKuhn\u2019s internalist account of normal scientific research as\nsowing the seeds of its own destruction through unintended innovation,\nresulting eventually in a kind of dialectical conflict that drives the\nenterprise forward. However, there is no Hegelian Spirit lurking\nwithin Kuhn\u2019s model, nor a permanent logic of science as its\nreplacement as there was for Lakatos (Lakatos 1970;\nHoyningen-H\u00fchne 1993; Bird 2008; Worrall 2003, 2008; Nickles\n2009).\n\nKuhn disliked being compared to Hegel, whose work he found obscure and\ncharacterized by a non-naturalistic philosophy of history, but it is\nworth commenting further on the partial resemblance. Both Kant and\nHegel rejected na\u00efve empiricism, according to which all human\nknowledge arises, somehow, from the accumulative aggregation of\nindividual sensations or perceptions. Kant argued that we need\ntranscendental structures such as a system of processing rules in\norder to organize sensory input into something coherent and\nintelligible, e.g., as physical objects interacting causally in space\nand time. These were Kant\u2019s forms of intuition (in space and\ntime) and categories (substance, causality, etc.). They represent the\nhuman mind\u2019s contribution to knowledge. (In this regard Kant can\nbe regarded as a forerunner of cognitive psychology.) Thus, our\nexperience of the world is shaped to fit a priori forms, and this is\nwhere the Kantian version of idealism enters the picture: the world of\nhuman experience is not the world of ultimate reality (Kant\u2019s\nunknowable, noumenal world of things-in-themselves); rather, it is a\nworld shaped by our own cognitive structures.\n\nHegel, one of the founders of the deep conception of historical change\nbroadly characteristic of nineteenth-century German scholarship,\nproceeded to historicize Kant\u2019s innovation, in effect by\nhistoricizing Kant\u2019s categories. They are not inborn, permanent,\nand universal; on the contrary, they are socio-historically acquired\nor lost and hence differ from one historical epoch to another. People\nliving in different epochs cognize the world differently. It is\ntempting to read the Kuhn of Structure as further\nrelativizing and localizing Hegel to specific scientific domains and\ntheir paradigms. Kuhn\u2019s model provides endogenous, dynamic\nmechanisms of (inadvertent) scientific innovations that sow the seeds\nof the paradigm\u2019s eventual destruction in a vaguely Hegelian\nsort of dialectical process. It thus becomes possible to experience a\nchange in categorical scheme within one\u2019s own lifetime\u2014the\nvictory of the new paradigm being the small-scale scientific\ncounterpart of Hegel watching Napoleon march in victory through the\nstreets of Jena! Thus it is tempting to regard Kuhnian revolutions as\nHegelian revolutions writ small.\n\nNonetheless, in terms of historical genealogy, Kuhn is better aligned\nwith the Kantian tradition, especially the neo-Kantian relativization\nof Kant. Interestingly, some logical empiricists (especially\nReichenbach) were influenced by the neo-Kantianism of the German\nMarburg School of philosophy to develop a historically relativized but\nconstitutive a priori (see below and Friedman 2001.)\n5.2 The German Neo-Kantian Tradition\n\nThere is a long historical gap between Kant/Hegel and Kuhn, and this\nspace is not empty. Many other thinkers, especially those in the\nvarious nineteenth-century idealist traditions, were Kantian or\nHegelian or neo-Hegelian or neo-Kantian opponents of empiricist\npositions that they considered na\u00efve, such as that of John Stuart\nMill. The neo-Kantian label applies even to prominent logical\npositivists of the Vienna Circle and logical empiricists of the Berlin\nCircle, who have too often been caricatured as simple, cumulative\nempiricists. As Friedman (2001) and others have shown, several\nfounders of twentieth-century academic philosophy of science extended\nthe neo-Kantian attack on simple empiricism. The basic idea here is\nthat, just as Kant regarded any account of perception and knowledge as\nna\u00efvely empiricist insofar as it left no room for underlying\ncognitive organizing principles, so any account of the sciences that\nprovided no analogous underlying social-cognitive framework was a\ncontinuation of simple empiricism, i.e., a version of\n\u201cpositivism.\u201d In this particular respect, W. V.\nQuine\u2019s \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d and Word and\nObject (Quine 1951, 1960) were throwbacks to simple empiricism in\ntheir attempt to eliminate the Kantian formal component.\n\nThe German Marburg School of Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, and Ernst\nCassirer was especially important in the emergence of modern\nphilosophy of science in the form of the logical positivism and\nlogical empiricism. Friedman (2001 and elsewhere) has explored its\ninfluence on young Reichenbach\u2019s attempt to interpret the\nsignificance of the new relativity theory. Rudolf Carnap had been\ninfluenced by Ernst Cassirer, among others. (See the entries on\nlogical empiricism, Reichenbach, Carnap, Cohen, Natorp, and Cassirer.)\nCassirer\u2019s central theme was the fundamental epistemological\nimplications of the replacement of Aristotle\u2019s subject-predicate\nlogic and substance ontology by the new relational logic of the\nmodern, mathematical-functional approach to nature. This could not be\na priori in Kant\u2019s original sense, since the emergence of\nnon-Euclidean geometry had shown that there are alternative organizing\nprinciples. But the very fact that we still needed organizing\nstructures that are constitutive or definitive of the cognitive\nenterprise in question meant that Kant was still basically correct.\nLike Moritz Schlick, the first leader of the Vienna Circle,\nReichenbach of the Berlin school parlayed his engagement with\nrelativity theory and non-Euclidean geometries into a conception of\nthe \u201crelativized a priori.\u201d All of this by around 1920,\nwith the younger Carnap\u2019s views developing during the 1920s and\n\u201830s. In the USA, meanwhile, C. I. Lewis (1929) was defending\nhis \u201cpragmatic a priori.\u201d\n\nIn his famous paper of 1950, \u201cEmpiricism, Semantics, and\nOntology,\u201d Carnap made his two-tiered view of inquiry quite\nexplicit. Starting from the problem of the existence of abstract\nentities, Carnap distinguished internal questions, that is, questions\nthat can arise and be answered within a particular logico-linguistic\nframework, from external questions, that is, meta-level questions\nabout which framework to prefer. External questions cannot be answered\nin the same, disciplined manner as internal, for choice of framework\nis ultimately a pragmatic decision based on the expected fertility of\nusing one framework rather than another. Although it is difficult to\nequate Carnap\u2019s fruitfulness decisions with Kuhn\u2019s\nrevolutionary breaks (Kuhn 1993, 313f), Carnap regarded his vision of\nscience as similar to Kuhn\u2019s, and he liked the manuscript of\nStructure that Kuhn submitted to the International\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science, as George Reisch (1991) has\nshown. Thus the clash of Kuhn\u2019s work with that of Carnap and the\npositivist movement has been exaggerated.\n\nAlthough both defended two-tiered conceptions of inquiry, there are\nimportant differences between Kuhn and Carnap (as Friedman, 2001,\n2003, 2010, among others, observes). For Carnap, as for Reichenbach,\nthe choice of framework or coordinating definitions was conventional,\na matter of convenience or heuristic fertility, whereas for committed\nKuhnian normal scientists the foundational tenets of their paradigm\nare deep truths about the world, principles not subject to empirical\ntest. (However, in a crisis situation, fertility becomes a key element\nin theory and paradigm choice.) In Carnap\u2019s frameworks these\nwere explicit systems of logical rules, whereas Kuhn\u2019s account\nof normal science largely jettisoned rule-based knowledge in favor of\na kind of case-based tacit knowledge, the cases being the concrete\nexemplars. Third, Kuhn himself emphasized that his approach was\nhistorical, whereas Carnap\u2019s was not. Although a Carnapian\nchange from one logical framework to another could, in principle, be\nquite revolutionary, Carnap himself never emphasized this point,\nsuggested nothing of Kuhn\u2019s radical discontinuity, and was\nsimply not interested in the history of science.\n\nMeanwhile, Friedman himself has extensively developed the idea of\nhistorically contingent but constitutive a prioris (e.g., 2001, 2003,\n2008). He is sympathetic to Kuhn\u2019s view that revolutions occur\nwhen the constitutive principles change. From the old point of view,\nthere is disruptive and incommensurability, but defenders of the new\nviewpoint manages to establish a kind of continuity. Friedman goes\nwell beyond Kuhn in stressing the role of philosophical ideas in\nestablishing this continuity.\n\nSince deep conceptual revolutions or paradigm-shifts are a fact of\nscientific life (and, I would argue, a necessity), we are never in a\nposition to make our present constitutive principles as truly\nuniversal principles of human reason\u2013as fixed once and for all\nthroughout the evolution of science.\n In recent work, Friedman devotes more attention to the\nsocial dimension, and he notes that even the standards of rationality\nmay continue to change historically. (See the entry \u201cHistorical\nTheories of Rationality\u201d. See also DiSalle 2002.)\n\n\nAnother development that appeals to Germanic themes in its criticism\nof naive empiricism is the idealization movement of the Pozna\u0144\nSchool in Poland, associated especially with Leszek Nowak. This group\nregards science as developing in an idealizational and dialectical\nmanner, ideas that they trace back to Karl Marx\u2019s analysis of\neconomics, inspired by his own study of Galileo\u2019s fruitful use\nof abstract, idealized models against the Aristotelians. The\nPozna\u0144 group regards idealization as the secret to modern science\nand finds it remarkable that virtually all previous analytic\nphilosophy of science remains Aristotelian in treating proposed laws\nand theories not as ideal models but as true or false statements\ndirectly about the real world (Nowak 1980 and later writings; see also\nKrajewsky 1977). As models, these constructions must be concretized to\nsome degree before they can be applied to the real world. While the\nidealizationists tend to reject Kuhnian revolutions as too\ndiscontinuous and irrational, they do see a resemblance to their\ninternalistic, dialectical conception of scientific development. For\nthem a revolution consists in a new theory or model that reveals a\npreviously unnoticed idealizing assumption built into its predecessor,\na change that alters scientists\u2019 conception of what is essential\nversus peripheral to the domain of phenomena in question. Hence there\ncan be a significant change of world-conception.\n\nThere is some affiliation of Pozna\u0144 with the European\nstructuralist account of theories, based on a set-theoretical analysis\nof theory structure and theory relations. Kuhn himself was much\nattracted to Joseph Sneed\u2019s approach (Sneed 1971), soon extended\nby Wolfgang Stegm\u00fcller (1974/1976) and others. Given the\ninformality of Kuhn\u2019s own approach and his explicit shunning of\nrules and rational reconstructions, his attraction to the\nstructuralist line was initially puzzling. However, the structuralists\nwere and are interested in intertheory relations, and models are\ncentral to their non-sentential conception of theories. These are\nmodels in the formal sense, but Kuhn found insightful connections to\nhis own use of models in the form of exemplars. For both Kuhn and the\nstructuralists it is the collection of exemplars or models, not an\nabstract statement of a theory, that carries the weight in scientific\ninquiry.\n\nAlready the early Kuhn, especially in the postscript to the second\nedition of Structure, largely abandoned the traditional\nconception of theories as deductive systems, even in physics, and\nsubstituted informal collections of models of various, exemplary\nkinds, along with a toolbox of expert practices for constructing and\napplying them (Cartwright 1983, Giere 1988, Teller 2008). He always\nliked Margaret Masterson\u2019s remark that \u201ca paradigm [in the\nsense of preferred models or exemplars] is what you use when the\ntheory is not there\u201d (Baltas et al. 2000, 300). Such a view,\nlike Nowak\u2019s, anticipates the move from theory-centered to\nmodel-centered accounts of scientific work. However, Kuhn\u2019s\nnormal scientific practitioners presumably hold the models to be true\nin their original application, as is the grand theory incorporated in\nthe paradigm, whereas today the emphasis is on modeling practices\nacross the sciences, in which the models are almost always known in\nadvance to be false because of their employment of idealizations,\napproximations, abstractions, etc.\n5.3 The French Discontinuity Theorists\n\nMeanwhile, important French thinkers had already taken a historical\napproach, one that explicitly characterizes science as a series of\nbreaks or coupures. The principal genealogy includes\nL\u00e9on Brunschvicg, Gaston Bachelard and his student, Georges\nCanguilhem, and the latter\u2019s student, Michel Foucault. Neither\nKuhn\u2019s historicism nor his talk of revolutionary breaks was news\nto the French (Gutting, 2001, 2003). The French tradition of science\nstudies, going back to Auguste Comte and including later figures such\nas Pierre Duhem and Henri Poincar\u00e9, possessed a historical\ndimension that positivism lost after Ernst Mach, as it became logical\npositivism. However, the French and Germanic traditions have some\nroots in common. As Gutting points out, Brunschvicg, like \u00c9mile\nMeyerson, was a science-oriented idealist. For him the mind is not a\npassive wax tablet; rather, it actively forges internal links among\nideas, yet it is also often surprised by the resistant exteriority of\nthe natural world. Against traditional metaphysics, philosophy of\nscience should limit itself to what the science of the time\nallows\u2014but not dogmatically so. For dogmatic attempts to extract\ntimeless principles and limitations (such as Kant\u2019s denial of\nthe possibility of non-Euclidean geometry) may soon be embarrassed by\nfurther scientific advances. Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity exemplifies the revolutionary nature of the most impressive\ndevelopments.\n\nBachelard, French physicist and philosopher-historian of science, also\nbelieved that only by studying history of science can we gain an\nadequate understanding of human reason. He stressed the importance of\nepistemological breaks or discontinuities (coupures\n\u00e9pist\u00e9mologiques). In Le Nouvel Esprit\nScientifique (1934), Bachelard argued that the worldview of\nclassical physics, valuable in its own time, eventually became an\nobstacle to future progress in physics. Hence a break was needed.\nHere, then, we already find the idea that a successful theory can lose\nits luster by being considered exhausted of its resources and thus\nlacking in fertility. Like Brunschvicg, Bachelard held that a\ndefensible, realist philosophy had to be based on the science of its\nday. Hence, scientific revolutions have (and ought to have) brought\nabout epistemological revolutions. The reality we posit, he said,\nought to be that of the best science but with the realization that our\nconcepts are active constructs of our own minds, not imported from\nnature\u2019s own language, as it were. Future mental activity as\nwell as future empirical findings are likely to require another\nrupture. As Gutting points out, Bachelard\u2019s account of\ndiscontinuity was not as radical as Kuhn\u2019s. Bachelard was\nwilling to speak of progress toward the truth. He made much of the\nfact that successor frameworks, such as non-Euclidean geometry or\nquantum physics, retain key predecessor results as special cases and,\nin effect, contextualize them.\n\nCanguilhem was more interested in the biological and health sciences\nthan Bachelard and gave great attention to the distinction between the\nnormal and the pathological, a distinction that does not arise in\nphysical science. For this and other reasons, in his view, we can\nexpect no reduction of biology to physics. Canguilhem provided a more\nnuanced conception of obstacles and ruptures, noting, for example,\nthat an approach such as vitalism that constitutes an obstacle in one\ndomain of research can simultaneously play a positive role elsewhere,\nas in helping biological scientists to resist reductive thinking. Here\nwe find context sensitivities and heuristic resources difficult to\ncapture in terms of a context- and content-neutral logic of science\nsuch as the logical empiricists espoused.\n\nBachelard and Canguilhem also had less disruptive conceptions of\nscientific objectivity and scientific closure than Kuhn. Canguilhem\ncriticized Kuhn\u2019s (alleged) view that rational closure could not\namount to more than group consensus. Both Frenchmen emphasized the\nimportance of norms and denied that disciplinary agreement was as weak\nas Kuhnian consensus. Kuhn replied to this sort of objection (in\n\u201cPostscript\u201d and elsewhere) that his scientific\ncommunities do possess shared values, that their agreement is not\nsomething arbitrary, say, as whipped up by political ideologues.\n\nFoucault\u2019s archaeology of knowledge (Foucault 1966, 1969) posits\na distinction between a superstructure of deliberately made\nobservations, claims, and arguments and a deep structure, most\nelements of which we are probably unconscious. Once again we meet a\ntwo-level account. Writes Hacking:\n\nFoucault used the French world connaissance to stand for such\nitems of surface knowledge while savoir meant more than\nscience; it was a frame, postulated by Foucault, within which surface\nhypotheses got their sense. Savoir is not knowledge in the\nsense of a bunch of solid propositions. This \u201cdepth\u201d\nknowledge is more like a postulated set of rules that determine what\nkinds of sentences are going to count as true or false in some domain.\nThe kinds of things to be said about the brain in 1780 are not the\nkinds of things to be said a quarter-century later. That is not\nbecause we have different beliefs about brains, but because\n\u201cbrain\u201d denotes a new kind of object in the later\ndiscourse, and occurs in different sorts of sentences. [2002, 77]\n\n\nGiven the influence of Foucault, we may also locate our discussion of\nHacking\u2019s own work on historical ontology here (Hacking 2002).\nHacking (1975, 1990, 1995, 2012) has studied in depth the emergence of\nprobability theory and (later) of statistical thinking and the\nconstruction of the modern self as key examples of what he terms\n\u201chistorical ontology.\u201d He acknowledges inspiration from\nboth Foucault\u2019s discursive formations and Crombie\u2019s styles\nof thinking (Crombie 1994), with a dose of Feyerabend thrown into the\nmix. Like Kuhn (and Friedman), Hacking returns to Kant\u2019s\n\u201chow possible?\u201d question, the answer to which sets out the\nnecessary conditions for a logical space of reasons in which\npractitioners can make true or false claims about objects and pose\nresearch questions about them. Hacking, too, historicizes the Kantian\nconception. He likes the term \u2018historical a priori\u2019, which\nCanguilhem once applied to the work of his erstwhile student,\nFoucault.\n\n\nThe historical a priori points at conditions whose dominion\nis as inexorable, there and then, as Kant\u2019s synthetic a\npriori. Yet they are at the same time conditioned and formed in\nhistory, and can be uprooted by later, radical, historical\ntransformations. T. S. Kuhn\u2019s paradigms have some of the\ncharacter of a historical a priori. [Hacking 2002, 5]\n\n\u2026\n\n[S]cientific styles of thinking & doing are not good\nbecause they find out the truth. They have become part of our\nstandards for what it is, to find out the truth. They establish\ncriteria of truthfulness. \u2026 Scientific reason, as manifested in\nCrombie\u2019s six genres of inquiry, has no foundation. The styles\nare how we reason in the sciences. To say that these styles\nof thinking & doing are self-authenticating is to say that they\nare autonomous: they do not answer to some other, higher, or deeper,\nstandard of truth and reason than their own. To repeat: No foundation.\nThe style does not answer to some external canon of truth independent\nof itself. [2012, 605; Hacking\u2019s emphasis]\n\n\nHacking describes changes in historical a prioris as\n\u201csignificant singularities during which the coordinates of\n\u2018scientific objectivity\u2019 are rearranged\u201d (2002,\n6).\n\nAlthough reminiscent of Kuhn\u2019s positions in some ways, there are\nstriking differences. As noted above, Hacking\u2019s constructed\nformations are much broader than Kuhn\u2019s. Thus he feels free to\nemploy telling bits of popular culture in laying out his claims, and\nhe admits to being whiggish in starting from the present and working\nbackward to find out how we got here. Moreover, in mature, modern\nscience, unlike Kuhnian paradigms, several of Hacking\u2019s styles\nof thinking and doing can exist side by side, e.g., the laboratory and\nhypothetical modeling traditions. Yet people living before and after\nthe historical crystallization of a style would find each other\nmutually unintelligible. Hacking recognizes that Kuhnian problems of\nrelativism (rather than subjectivism) lurk in such positions.\n\u201cJust as statistical reasons had no force for the Greeks, so one\nimagines a people for whom none of our reasons for belief have\nforce\u201d (2002, 163). This sort of incommensurability is closer to\nFeyerabend\u2019s extreme cases (as in the ancient Greek astronomers\nversus their Homeric predecessors) than to Kuhn\u2019s \u201cno\ncommon measure\u201d (2002, chap. 11). This sort of unintelligibility\nruns deeper than a Kuhnian translation failure. It is not a question\nof determining which old style statements match presumed new style\ntruths; rather, it is a question of the conditions for an utterance to\nmake a claim that is either true or false at all. Writes\nHacking,\n\nMany of the recent but already classical philosophical discussions of\nsuch topics as incommensurability, indeterminacy of translation, and\nconceptual schemes seem to discuss truth where they ought to be\nconsidering truth-or-falsehood. [2002, 160]\n\n\nBy contrast, Kuhnian paradigms include a set of positive assertions\nabout the world. Yet Kuhn himself was attracted by Hacking\u2019s way\nof putting the point about truth-and-falsity (Kuhn 2000, p. 99).\n5.4 Kuhn\u2019s Relation to the Germanic and French Traditions\n\nTo what extent was Kuhn indebted to these thinkers? As noted above, he\ntook Kant but not Hegel very seriously. He was largely self-taught in\nphilosophy of science. Among his contemporaries, he was familiar with\nPopper but not in any detail with the various strains of logical\npositivism and logical empiricism, in particular the positions of\nCarnap and Reichenbach. Apparently, he was only slightly acquainted\nwith the work of Bachelard while writing Structure, and they\nnever engaged in a fruitful interchange (Baltas et al. 2000, 284f).\nKuhn did acknowledge, in print and in his classes, the crucial\ninfluence on his historical and philosophical thinking of the two\nRussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, \u00c9mile Meyerson, author of\nIdentit\u00e9 et Realit\u00e9 (1908) and Alexandre\nKoyr\u00e9, especially his \u00c9tudes Galil\u00e9enes\n(1939), and that of Annaliese Maier, the German historian of medieval\nand early modern science. He had read Ludwik Fleck\u2019s Genesis\nand Development of a Scientific Fact (originally published in\nGerman in 1935) and Michael Polanyi\u2019s Personal\nKnowledge (1958) and had had some discussion with Polanyi (Baltas\net al. 2000, 296). Kuhn was also indebted to Wittgenstein, early\n(\u201cThe limits of my language are the limits of my world,\u201d\n1922, 148) and late (on language games and forms of life). (See\nSharrock and Read 2002, the introduction to Harris 2005, and Kindi\n2010 for Kuhn\u2019s relation to Wittgenstein and others.) He knew\nsomething of Toulmin\u2019s work.\n\nKuhn more than anyone in the Anglo-American world pointed out the need\nfor larger-sized units than individual theories in making sense of\nmodern science. Nonetheless, as we have seen, others in the Teutonic\nand Francophone worlds had previously postulated even larger\nsocio-intellectual units and correspondingly deeper changes than\nKuhn\u2019s, on somewhat different scales of intellectual space and\ntime. If we think of authors such as the Annales historian\nFernand Braudel, with his distinct time-scales, we recognize that the\nattribution of transformative change clearly depends heavily on the\nchoice of time-scale and on how fine- or course-grained is our\napproach. Hacking (2002, 76) makes this point with reference to the\nFrench context:\n\nThere are two extremes in French historiography. The Annales\nschool went in for long-term continuities or slow\ntransitions\u2014\u201cthe great silent motionless bases that\ntraditional history has covered with a thick layer of events\u201d\n(to quote from the first page of Foucault\u2019s 1969 Archeology\nof Knowledge). Foucault takes the opposite tack, inherited from\nGaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, and Louis Althusser. He posits\nsharp discontinuities in the history of knowledge.\n\n\nAlthough Kuhn emphasized the importance of skilled scientific\npractice, his paradigms remained closer to the articulate surface of\nscientific culture than Foucault\u2019s discursive formations, which\nare better located in the unconscious than in the Kuhnian\nsubconscious. Foucault does not speak of revolution.\n6. Other Revolution Claims and Examples\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (1861) remarked that \u201cRevolutions\nnever follow precedents nor furnish them.\u201d Given the\nunpredictability, the nonlinearity, the seeming uniqueness of\nrevolutions, whether political or scientific, it is therefore\nsurprising to find Thomas Kuhn attempting to provide a General Theory\nof Scientific Revolutions (Kindi 2005). Early Kuhn did seem to believe\nthat there is a single, underlying pattern to the development of\nmature sciences that is key to their success, and late Kuhn a\ndifferent pattern. Has either early or late Kuhn found such a pattern,\nor has he imposed his own philosophical structure on the vagaries and\nvicissitudes of history? Kuhn\u2019s Kantianism always did live in\ntension with his historicism, and in his late work (e.g., 2000c) he\nsurprisingly gave up the pretense of deriving his pattern of taxonomic\nchange and speciation from history of science, on the ground that it\nlargely followed \u201cfrom first principles.\u201d\n\nNumerous philosophers, scientists, and other commentators have made\nclaims about scientific change that differ from Kuhn\u2019s. (For a\nrecent selection see Soler et al. 2008.) Some, as we have seen, are\nskeptical of revolution talk altogether, others of Kuhn\u2019s in\nparticular. Still others accept that some revolutions are Kuhnian but\ndeny that all of them are. One common criticism is that not all\nrevolutionary advances are preceded by an acute crisis, that is, by\nmajor failures of preceding research. Kuhn himself allowed for\nexceptions already in Structure. Another is that\nrevolutionary changes need not involve discontinuities in all of\nKuhn\u2019s levels at once (especially Laudan 1984). Yet another is\nthat there need be little logical or linguistic discontinuity. A\nrapid, seemingly transformative change in research practices may\ninvolve simply a marked gain in data accessibility or accuracy or\ncomputational processing ability via new instrumentation or\nexperimental design. And on the later Kuhn\u2019s own view,\nrevolution need not be a game of creative destruction. Only a few\nexamples can be considered here.\n6.1 Some Alternative Conceptions of Scientific Revolution\n\nDo revolutions consist, according to Kuhn, of major new materials\n(experimental facts, theories, models, instruments, techniques)\nentering a scientific domain or, instead, of a major restructuring or\nrearrangement of materials, practices, and community affiliations\nalready present? Kuhn states that the relativity revolution might\nserve as\n\na prototype for revolutionary reorientation in the sciences. Just\nbecause it did not involve the introduction of additional objects or\nconcepts, the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics\nillustrates with particular clarity the scientific revolution as a\ndisplacement of the conceptual network through which scientists view\nthe world. [1970, 102]\n\n\nThe reader may find this claim confusing, however, because in the\njust-preceding paragraphs Kuhn had emphasized the ontological and\nconceptual changes of precisely this revolution, e.g., the radical\nchange in the concept of mass. Einstein\u2019s masses are not\nNewtonian masses, he insisted. They are newly introduced entities;\nhence, we may infer, new content. Yet Kuhn surely does have a point\nworth saving, in that relativity theory still deals with most of the\nsame kinds of phenomena and problems as classical mechanics and\nemploys immediate successors to the classical concepts. But, if so,\nthen reorganization of familiar materials implies a disciplinary\ncontinuity through revolution that Kuhn minimized.\n\nThat reorganization dominates Kuhn\u2019s conception of revolutions\nis apparent throughout his work. As a young scholar he had an epiphany\nwhen Aristotle\u2019s seemingly radically false or unintelligible\nclaims suddenly came together for him as a coherent, comprehensive\nworldview. This experience became Kuhn\u2019s psychological model for\nrevolutionary transformation from one paradigm to its successor and\ninformed his later talk of Gestalt switches. But he also emphasized\nthat revolution involves social reorganization of the field\n(not merely the cognitive reorganization of an individual), from one\nform of scientific life to another, incompatible with it. By\nimplication, his structural or formal conception of revolution\nexcluded the alternative idea of revolution as extraordinary bursts in\nsubstantive content.\n\nIn Conceptual Revolutions, Paul Thagard (1992) retains\nsomething of Kuhn\u2019s idea of conceptual transformation and the\nmore specific idea of taxonomic transformation. He distinguishes two\nkinds of reclassification, in terms of the language of tree structures\nused in computer science: branch jumping and tree switching. Branch\njumping reclassifies or relocates something to another branch of the\nsame tree, e.g., reclassifying the whale as a mammal rather than a\nfish, the earth as a planet, or Brownian motion as a physical rather\nthan a biological phenomenon. New branches can appear and old branches\ncan be eliminated. Meanwhile, tree switching replaces an entire\nclassification tree by a different tree structure based on different\nprinciples of classification, as when Darwin replaced the static\nclassification tree of Linnaeus by one based on evolutionary genealogy\nand when Mendeleev replaced alternative classification systems of the\nchemical elements by his own table. Taking a computational approach to\nphilosophy of science, Thagard employs his computer program ECHO to\nreconstruct and evaluate several historical cases of alleged\nconceptual revolution and arrives at a tamer conception of\nrevolutionary breaks than Kuhn\u2019s.\n\nThe Cognitive Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Hanne\nAndersen, Peter Barker, and Xiang Chen (2006) also devotes a good deal\nof attention to cognition and categorization issues, in a defense of\nthe later Kuhn\u2019s approach. The work of cognitive psychologist\nLawrence Barsalou and of philosopher-historian Nancy Nersessian (the\nfounder of the \u201ccognitive historical\u201d approach to science)\nplays a significant role in their account. Nersessian herself (2003,\n2008) emphasizes model-based reasoning. These are no longer static\ncases or exemplars, for they possess an internal dynamic.\n\nHoward Margolis (1993) distinguishes two kinds of revolutions,\ndepending on which kinds of problems they solve. Those revolutions\nthat bridge gaps, he contends, differ from those that surmount or\npenetrate or somehow evade barriers. His focus is on barriers, a\nneglected topic even though it fits Kuhn\u2019s account of cognition\nwell. Margolis develops Kuhnian themes in terms of deeply ingrained\n\u201chabits of mind.\u201d While such habits are necessary for\nefficient scientific work within any specialty discipline, they\nconstitute barriers to alternative conceptions. More broadly, deeply\ningrained cultural habits of mind can close off opportunities that,\naccording to the perspective of later generations, were staring them\nin the face. Margolis is struck by the apparent fact that all the\nmaterials for Copernicus\u2019 new model of the solar system had been\navailable, in scattered form, for centuries. No new gap-crossing\ndevelopments were needed. He concludes that, rather than a gap to be\nbridged, the problem was a cognitive barrier that needed to be\nremoved, a barrier that blocked expert mathematical astronomers from\nbringing together, as mutually relevant, what turned out to be the\ncrucial premises, and then linking them in the tight way that\nCopernicus did. If Margolis\u2019 account of the Copernican\nRevolution is correct, it provides an example of revolution as\nholistic reorganization of available materials, hence the\nnon-piecemeal, noncumulative nature of revolutions. The developments\nthat lead to a barrier\u2019s removal can be minor and, as in the\ncase of Copernicus, even quite peripheral to the primary subject\nmatter that they ultimately help to transform. Here one thinks of a\nmodel popular with mystery writers, where an everyday observation\nleads to a sudden change in perspective.\n\nDavis Baird (2004) contends that there can be revolutions in practice\nthat are not conceptual revolutions. He emphasizes the knowledge\nembodied in skills and in instruments themselves. His central example\nis analytic chemistry.\n\nThere is little doubt that analytical chemistry has undergone a\nradical change. The practice of the analyst, who now deals with large,\nexpensive equipment, is different than it was in 1930. Modern\ninstrumental methods are by and large more sensitive and accurate,\nhave lower limits of detection, and require smaller samples; different\nkinds of analyses can be performed. Analytical chemistry is much less\na science of chemical separations and much more a science of\ndetermining and deploying the physical properties of substances.\n\u2026 The revolutionary phase of Thomas S. Kuhn\u2019s Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions starts with a crisis, a problem that the\nestablished methods of normal science cannot solve (Kuhn [1962] 1970;\n1996, ch. 5). There was no such crisis in analytical chemistry. While\none might imagine that analytical chemistry underwent a change of\nparadigm, there was no crisis that provoked this change. Pre-1930\nanalytical chemists did not bemoan the inability of their chemistry to\nsolve certain problems. Instead, new methods were developed that could\nsolve established \u201csolved\u201d problems, but solve them\nbetter: more efficiently, with smaller samples, greater sensitivity,\nand lower limits of detection. These changes in analytical chemistry\ndo not suffer from any kind of incommensurability: today, one can\neasily enough understand what analytical chemists were doing in\n1900\u2013although the idea that the analytical chemist is one who\ncan quantitatively manufacture pure chemicals is startling on first\nencounter. \u2026 The transformation in analytical chemistry passes\nall of Cohen\u2019s tests.\n\n\nRecently, Rogier De Langhe (2012, 2014a and b, 2017) has been\ndeveloping a broadly Kuhnian, two-process account of science from an\neconomics standpoint. Instead of doing a series of historical cases,\nDe Langhe and colleagues are developing algorithms to detect subtle\npatterns in the large citation databases now available. De Langue\nemploys economic arguments to illuminate such themes as the division\nof cognitive labor, models of scientific progress, and\nscientists\u2019 decisions about whether to specialize or to\ninnovate. \n6.2 Some Biological Cases\n\nThe account of the dynamics of science in Structure ill fit\nthe rapid splitting and recombining of fields in the post-World War II\nera of Big Science, as Kuhn recognized. So he excluded from his\naccount the division and recombination of already mature fields such\nas happened with the emergence of biochemistry. (This exclusion is\ntroubling, given the universal thrust of his account. It is as if Kuhn\nadmitted that his account applies only to a particular historical\nperiod that is now largely past; yet he also wrote as if the\nnormal-revolutionary model would apply to mature disciplines into the\nlong future.) In his later work he did devote careful attention to the\ndivision of fields into specialties and subspecialties (see \u00a75).\nHowever, he still gave little attention to the more-or-less reverse\nprocess of new fields coming into existence by combinations of\npreviously distinct fields as well as to cross- and trans-disciplinary\nresearch, in which a variety of different specialists somehow succeed\nin working together (Galison 1997, Kellert 2008, Andersen 2013).\n\nAnd what can we make, on Kuhn\u2019s account, of the explosion of\nwork in molecular biology following the Watson-Crick discovery, in\n1953, of the chemical structure of DNA and the development of better\nlaboratory equipment and techniques? Molecular genetics quickly grew\ninto the very general field of molecular biology. Less than two\ndecades after Watson and Crick, Gunther Stent could already write in\nhis 1971 textbook:\n\nHow times have changed! Molecular genetics has \u2026 grown from the\nesoteric specialty of a small, tightly knit vanguard into an\nelephantine academic discipline whose basic doctrines today form part\nof the primary school science curriculum. [Stent 1971, ix]\n\n\nThere is something paradigmatic about molecular biology and also\nsomething revolutionary about its rapid progress and expansion. It is\nnot clear how to characterize this and similar developments. Was this\na Kuhnian revolution? It did involve major social and intellectual\nreorganization, one that conflicted with the previous ones in some\nrespects but without undermining the Darwinian paradigm. Quite the\ncontrary. Or is molecular biology more like a style of scientific\npractice than a paradigm? Such an explosive development as molecular\nbiology hardly fits Kuhn\u2019s description of steady, normal\nscientific articulation of the new paradigm by puzzle solving.\nInstead, it seems better to regard it as a large toolkit of methods or\ntechniques applicable to several specialty fields rather than as an\nintegrative theory-framework within one field.\n\nShould we then focus on practices rather than on integrative theories\nin our interpretation of Kuhnian paradigms? The trouble with this move\nis that practices can also change so rapidly that it is tempting to\nspeak of revolutionary transformations of scientific work even though\nthere is little change in the overarching theoretical framework (see\nPart II of Soler et al. 2008). Moreover, as Baird (2004) points out,\nthe rapid replacement of old practices by new is often a product of\nefficiency rather than intellectual incompatibility. Why continue to\ndo gene sequencing by hand when automated processing in now available?\nReplacement can also be a product of change in research style, given\nthat, as Kuhn already recognized, scientific communities are cultural\ncommunities.\n\nSimilar points can be made about the rise of statistical physics,\nmentioned above in relation to Hacking\u2019s work. (See also Brush\n1983 and Porter 1986.) This was an explosion of work within the\nclassical mechanical paradigm rather than a slow, puzzle-by-puzzle\narticulation of precisely that paradigm in its own previous terms. Or\nwas it? For Kuhn himself recognized that modern mathematical physics\nonly came into existence starting around 1850 and that Maxwellian\nelectrodynamics was a major departure from the strictly Newtonian\nparadigm. In any case, there was much resistance among physicists to\nthe new style of reasoning. The kinetic theory of gases quickly grew\ninto statistical mechanics, which leapt the boundaries of its initial\nspecialty field. New genres as well as new styles of\nmathematical-physical thinking quickly replaced old\u2014and\ndisplaced the old generation of practitioners. Yet on Kuhn\u2019s\nofficial theory of science it was all just \u201cclassical\nmechanics.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the biological and chemical sciences do not readily\ninvite a Kuhnian analysis, given the usual, theory-centered\ninterpretation of Kuhn. For biological fields rarely produce lawful\ntheories of the kind supposedly found in physics. Indeed, it is\ncontroversial whether there exist distinctly biological laws at all.\nAnd yet the biological sciences have advanced so rapidly that their\ndevelopment cries out for the label \u2018revolutionary\u2019.\n\nWhat of the emerging field of evolutionary-developmental biology\n(evo-devo)? It is too soon to know whether future work in this\naccelerating field will merely complete evolutionary biology rather\nthan displacing it. It does seem unlikely that it will amount to a\ncomplete, revolutionary overturning of the Darwinian paradigm. (Kuhn\nmight reply that the discovery of homeobox genes overturned a smaller\nparadigm based on the expectation that the genetic makeup of different\norders of organisms would have little in common at the relevant level\nof description.) And if it complements the Darwinian paradigm, then\nevo-devo is, again, surely too big and too rapidly advancing to be\nconsidered a mere, piecemeal, puzzle-solving articulation of that\nparadigm. Based on work to date, evo-devo biologist Sean B. Carroll,\nfor example, holds precisely the complement view\u2014complementary\nyet revolutionary:\n\nEvo-Devo constitutes the third major act in a continuing evolutionary\nsynthesis. Evo-Devo has not just provided a critical missing piece of\nthe Modern Synthesis\u2014embryology\u2014and integrated it with\nmolecular genetics and traditional elements such as paleontology. The\nwholly unexpected nature of some of its key discoveries and the\nunprecedented quality and depth of evidence it has provided toward\nsettling previously unresolved questions bestow it with a\nrevolutionary character. [2005, 283]\n Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb (2005) make even stronger\nKuhnian-revolutionary claims for evo-devo, which they see as a partial\nreturn to a Lamarckian perspective. It was in his review of their book\nthat Godfrey-Smith (2007) suggested that recent biological progress is\na deluge rather than a Kuhnian revolution.\n\n6.3 Nonlinear Dynamics\n\nKuhn treated a scientific field (and perhaps science as a whole) as a\nsystem with a far more interesting internal dynamics than either\nPopper or the logical empiricists had proposed. The famous opening\nparagraphs of Structure read as though Kuhn had analyzed a\nhistorical time series and extracted a pattern from it inductively as\nthe basis for his model of scientific development. The broadly cyclic\nnature of this pattern immediately jumps out at dynamical systems\ntheorists. Yet despite this perhaps promising start as an early\ndynamical modeler of science, Kuhn apparently paid little attention to\nthe explosion of work in nonlinear dynamics that began with\n\u201cchaos\u201d theory and widened into such areas as complex\nadaptive systems and network theory. This is unfortunate, since the\nnew developments might have provided valuable tools for articulating\nhis own ideas.\n\nFor example, it would appear that, as Kuhnian normal science becomes\nmore robust in the sense of closing gaps, tightening connections, and\nthereby achieving multiple lines of derivation and hence mutual\nreinforcement of many results. However, that very fact makes normal\nscience increasingly fragile, less resilient to shocks, and more\nvulnerable to cascading failure (Nickles 2008). Kuhn claimed, contrary\nto the expectations of scientific realists, that there would be no end\nto scientific revolutions in ongoing, mature sciences, with no reason\nto believe that such revolutions would gradually diminish in size as\nthese sciences continued to mature. But it would seem to follow from\nhis model that he could have made a still stronger point. For\nKuhn\u2019s position in Structure arguably implies that,\nwhen considering a single field over time, future revolutions can\noccasionally be even larger than before. The reason is that just\nmentioned: as research continues filling gaps and further articulating\nthe paradigm, normal science becomes more tightly integrated but also\nforges tighter links to relevant neighboring fields. Taking these\ndevelopments into account predicts that Kuhnian normal science should\nevolve toward an ever more critical state in which something that was\nonce an innocuous anomaly can now trigger a cascade of failures\n(Nickles 2012a and b), sometimes rather quickly. For there will be\nlittle slack left to absorb such discrepancies. If so, then we have an\nimportant sort of dynamical nonlinearity even in normal science, which\nmeans that Kuhnian normal science itself is more dynamic, less static,\nthan he made it out to be.\n\nIt seems clear that Kuhnian revolutions are bifurcations in the\nnonlinear dynamical sense, and it seems plausible to think that\nKuhnian revolutions may have a fat-tailed or power-law distribution\n(or worse) when their size is plotted over time on an appropriate\nscale. Each of these features is a \u201challmark of nonlinear\ndynamics\u201d (Hooker 2011A, 5; 2011B, 850, 858). To elaborate a\nbit: one intriguing suggestion coming from work in nonlinear dynamics\nis that scientific changes may be like earthquakes and many other\nphenomena (perhaps including punctuated equilibrium events of the\nGould-Eldredge sort as well as mass extinction events in biology) in\nfollowing a power-law distribution in which there are exponentially\nfewer changes of a given magnitude than the number of changes in the\nnext lower category. For example, there might be only one magnitude 5\nchange (or above) for every ten magnitude 4 changes (on average over\ntime), as in the Gutenberg-Richter scale for earthquakes. If so, then\nscientific revolutions would be scale free, meaning that large\nrevolutions in the future are more probable than a Gaussian normal\ndistribution would predict. Such a conclusion would have important\nimplications for the issue of scientific realism.\n\nTo be sure, working out such a timescale of revolutions and their\nsizes in the history of science would be difficult and controversial,\nbut Nicholas Rescher (1978, 2006) has begun the task in terms of\nranking scientific discoveries and studying their distribution over\ntime. Derek Price (1963) had previously introduced quantitative\nhistorical considerations into history of science, pointing out, among\nmany other things, the exponential increase in the number of\nscientists and quantity of their publications since the Scientific\nRevolution. Such an exponential increase, faster than world population\nincrease, obviously cannot continue forever and, in fact, was already\nbeginning to plateau in industrialized nations in the 1960s. Among\nphilosophers, Rescher was probably the first to analyze aggregate data\nconcerning scientific innovation, arguing that, as research\nprogresses, discoveries of a given magnitude become more difficult.\nRescher concludes that we must eventually expect a decrease in the\nrate of discovery of a given magnitude and hence, presumably, a\nsimilar decrease in the rate of scientific revolutions. Although he\ndoes not mention Schumpeter in this work, he expresses a similar\nview:\n\nScientific progress in large measure annihilates rather than enlarges\nwhat has gone before\u2014it builds the new on the foundations of the\nruins of the old. Scientific theorizing generally moves ahead not by\naddition and enlargement but by demolition and\nreplacement. [1978, p. 82, Rescher\u2019s emphasis]\n\n\nThis broadly Kuhnian position position on the number and magnitude of\nrevolutions contrasts sharply with Butterfield\u2019s, who saw\nrevolutions only as founding revolutions, and also with that of those\nepistemological realists who grant that revolutionary conceptual and\npractical changes have occurred but who believe that they will become\nsuccessively smaller in the future as science approaches the true\ntheory. Kuhn\u2019s own later position, in which specialties are\ninsulated from one another by taxonomic incommensurability, presents\nus with a somewhat less integrated conception of science and thus one\nless subject to large-scale revolutionary disruption. Since we can\nregard scientific practices and organization as highly designed\ntechnological systems, the work of Charles Perrow and others on\ntechnological risk is relevant here. (See Perrow 1984 for entry into\nthis approach.)\n\nMargolis (1993) notes the importance of the phenomenon of\n\u201ccontagion,\u201d in which new ideas or practices suddenly\nreach a kind of social tipping point and spread rapidly. Contagion is,\nof course, necessary for a revolt to succeed as a revolution. Today,\ncontagion is a topic being studied carefully by network theorists and\npopularized by Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s The Tipping Point\n(2000). Steven Strogatz, Duncan Watts, and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3\nBarab\u00e1si are among the new breed of network theorists who are\ndeveloping technical accounts of \u201cphase changes\u201d resulting\nfrom the growth and reorganization of networks, including social\nnetworks of science\u2014a topic dear to the early Kuhn\u2019s heart\nas he struggled with the themes of Structure (see Strogatz,\n2003, chap. 10; Watts 1999; Newman 2001; Barab\u00e1si 2002;\nBuchanan 2002).\n\nDoes the emergence to prominence of \u201cchaos theory\u201d\n(nonlinear dynamics) itself constitute a scientific revolution and, if\nso, is it a distinctly Kuhnian revolution? In recent years several\nwriters, including both scientists and science writers, have attempted\nto link Kuhn\u2019s idea of revolutionary paradigm shifts to the\nemergence of chaos theory, complexity theory, and network theory\n(e.g., Gleick 1987, chap. 2, on the chaos theory revolution; Ruelle\n1991, chap. 11; Jen in Cowan et al. 1999, 622f, on complexity theory;\nand Buchanan 2002, 47, on network theory). Interestingly, some authors\nreapply these ideas to Kuhn\u2019s account itself, theoretically\nconstruing revolutionary paradigm shifts as phase changes or as\nnonlinear jumps from one strange attractor or one sort of network\nstructure to another.\n\nSteven Kellert (1993) considers and rejects the claim that chaos\ntheory represents a Kuhnian revolution. Although it does provide a new\nset of research problems and standards and, to some degree, transforms\nour worldview, it does not overturn and replace an entrenched theory.\nKellert argues that chaos theory does not even constitute the\nemergence of a new, mature science rather than an extension of\nstandard mechanics, although it may constitute a new style of\nreasoning.\n\nKellert\u2019s position hangs partly on how we construe theories. If\na theory is just a toolbox of models, something like an integrated\ncollection of Kuhnian exemplars (Giere 1988, Teller 2008), then the\nclaim for a revolutionary theory development of some kind becomes more\nplausible. For nonlinear dynamics highlights a new set of models and\nthe strange attractors that characterize their behaviors. In addition,\ncomplex systems theorists often stress the holistic, anti-reductive,\nemergent nature of the systems they study, by contrast with the\nlinear, Newtonian paradigm. Kuhn wrote that one way in which normal\nscience articulates its paradigm is by \u201cpermitting the solution\nof problems to which it had previously only drawn attention.\u201d\nBut had not classical dynamics suppressed rather than drawn attention\nto the problems of chaos theory and the various sorts of complexity\ntheory and network theory that are much studied today? Still, it is\neasy to agree with Kellert that this case does not fit Kuhn\u2019s\naccount neatly. To some readers it suggests that a more pluralistic\nconception of scientific revolutions than Kuhn\u2019s is needed.\n\nKellert also questions whether traditional dynamics was really in a\nspecial state of crisis prior to the recent emphasis on nonlinear\ndynamics, for difficulties in dealing with nonlinear phenomena have\nbeen apparent almost from the beginning. Since Kuhn himself\nemphasized, against Popper, that all theories face anomalies at all\ntimes, it is unfortunately all too easy, after an apparently\nrevolutionary development, to point back and claim crisis.\n6.4 The Essential Tension between Tradition and Innovation\n\nKuhn\u2019s work called attention to what he called \u201cthe\nessential tension\u201d between tradition and innovation (Kuhn 1959,\n1977a). While he initially claimed that his model applied only to\nmature natural sciences such as physics, chemistry, and parts of\nbiology, he believed that the essential tension point applies, in\nvarying degrees, to all enterprises that place a premium on creative\ninnovation. His work thereby raises interesting questions, such as\nwhich kinds of social structures make revolution necessary (by\ncontrast with more continuous varieties of transformative change) and\nwhether those that do experience revolutions tend to be more\nprogressive by some standard.\n\nSome analysts agree that casting the net more widely might shed\ncomparative light on scientific change, and that Kuhn\u2019s model is\ntoo restrictive even when applied only to the mature sciences. We have\nalready met several alternative conceptions of transformative change\nin the sciences. Kuhn believed that innovation in the arts was often\ntoo divergent fully to express the essential tension. By contrast, the\nsciences, he claimed, do not seek innovation for its own sake, at\nleast normal scientists do not.\n\nBut what about technological innovation (which is often closely\nrelated to mature science) and what about business enterprise more\ngenerally? There are, of course, important differences between the\nproducts of basic scientific research and commercial products and\nservices, but there are enough similarities to make comparison\nworthwhile\u2014the more so with today\u2019s emphasis on\ntranslational science. And in the sciences as well as economic life\nthere would seem to be other forms of displacement than the logical\nand epistemological forms commonly recognized by philosophers of\nscience. Consider the familiar economic phenomenon of obsolescence,\nincluding cases that lead to major social reorganization as\ntechnological systems are improved. Think of algorithmic data mining\nand statistical computation, robotics, and the automation to be found\nin any modern biological laboratory. In The Innovator\u2019s\nDilemma (1997), economist Clayton Christensen denies that major\ntechnological breakthroughs are either necessary or sufficient for\ndisruptive innovation. In that and later work he distinguishes\nsustaining technologies that make incremental improvements of a\ncompany\u2019s sales leaders from two kinds of disruptive\ntechnologies. \u201cNew-market disruptions\u201d appeal to a\npreviously non-existent market, whereas\n\u201clow-market\u201d or \u201clow-end disruptions\u201d provide\nsimpler and cheaper ways to do things than do the leading products and\nservices. Such companies can sometimes scale up their more efficient\nprocesses to displace the major players, as did Japanese steel makers\nto the big U.S. corporations. There would seem to be parallels in the\nhistory of science.\n\nSpeaking of technological developments, philosophers, including Kuhn,\nhave undervalued a major source of transformative developments,\nnamely, material culture, specifically the development of new\ninstruments. There is, however, a growing literature in history and\nsociology of science and technology. A good example is Andy\nPickering\u2019s discussion of the conception and construction of the\nlarge cloud chamber at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (Pickering 1995).\nPickering\u2019s Constructing Quarks (1984), Peter\nGalison\u2019s How Experiments End (1987) and Image and\nLogic (1997), and Sharon Traweek\u2019s Beamtimes and\nLifetimes (1988) describe the cultures that grew up around the\nbig machines and big theories of high-energy physics in the U.S.,\nEurope, and Japan. As he himself recognized, Kuhn\u2019s model of\nrapid change runs into increasing difficulty with the Big Science of\nthe World War II era and beyond. But a similar point extends to\nsmaller-scale material practices as documented by much recent\nresearch, as in Baird (2004), discussed above. One line of fruitful\ninvestigation has been that of the Social Construction of Technology\n(SCOT) program of Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker (see Bijker et al.\n1987 and a good deal of later work). Such work takes place on all\nscales.\n\nIn Structure and later writings, Kuhn locates revolutionary\nchange both at the logico-semantical and methodological level\n(incompatibility between successor and predecessor paradigm) and at\nthe level of form of community life and practice. But does the latter\nalways require the former? Perhaps expressions such as \u201cthe\nproblem of conceptual change\u201d and \u201cbreaking out\nof the old conceptual framework\u201d have led philosophers to\nover-intellectualize historical change. As we know from the history of\neconomics and business, one form of life can replace another in\nvarious ways without being based directly upon a logical or semantic\nincompatibility. The old ways may be not wrong but simply obsolete,\ninefficient, out of fashion\u2014destroyed by a process that requires\nmore resources than simple logical relations to understand it. There\ncan be massive displacement by non-logical means. Many have argued\nthat Kuhn\u2019s semantic holism, with its logical-relational\nunderpinnings, led him to underappreciate how flexible scientists and\ntechnologists can be at the frontiers of research (Galison 1997).\nHaving distinguished the working scientists\u2019 point of view from\nthose of the historian and the philosopher, looking down from above,\nhe proceeded to confuse them. Retrospectively, as many commentators\nhave noted, we can view Kuhn on scientific revolutions as a\ntransitional figure, more indebted to logical empiricist conceptions\nof logic, language, and meaning than he could have recognized at the\ntime, while departing sharply from the logical empiricists and Popper\nin other respects.",
