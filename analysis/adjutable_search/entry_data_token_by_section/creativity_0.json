The Philosophy of Creativity: Past and Present\n\nGiven the significance creativity has in our lives and the deep\nphilosophical questions it raises, one might expect creativity to be a\nmajor topic in philosophy. Curiously, it isn\u2019t.\n\nTo be sure, some of the most prominent figures in the history of\nWestern philosophy have been fascinated with creativity\u2014or what\nwe now call \u201ccreativity\u201d. According to some scholars, the\nabstract noun for creativity did not appear until the nineteenth\ncentury\u2014but the phenomenon certainly existed and many\nphilosophers took an interest in it (McMahon 2013; Nahm 1956; Murray\n1989; Tatarkiewicz 1980: chapter 8).\n\nTo name just a few examples: Plato (4th century BCE) had\nSocrates say, in certain dialogues, that when poets produce truly\ngreat poetry, they do it not through knowledge or mastery, but rather\nby being divinely \u201cinspired\u201d by the Muses, in a state of\npossession that exhibits a kind of madness (Ion and\nPhaedrus). Aristotle (3rd century BCE), in\ncontrast, characterized the work of the poet as a rational,\ngoal-directed activity of making (poeisis), in which the poet\nemploys various means (such as sympathetic characters and plots\ninvolving twists of fate) to achieve an end (of eliciting various\nemotions in the audience). Margaret Cavendish (1623\u20131673) and\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) championed the\ncreative use of the imagination to pursue freedom, overcome prejudice,\nand cultivate natural abilities even despite social and political\noppression. Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804) conceived of artistic genius as an innate capacity\nto produce original works through the free play of the imagination, a\nprocess which does not consist in following rules, can neither be\nlearned nor taught, and is mysterious even to geniuses themselves.\nSchopenhauer (1788\u20131860) stressed that the greatest artists are\ndistinguished not only by the technical skill they employ in the\nproduction of art, but also by the capacity to \u201close\nthemselves\u201d in the experience of what is beautiful and sublime\n(Schopenhauer 1859: Vol. I: 184\u2013194 and Vol. II: 376\u2013402).\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) argued that the greatest feats\nof creativity, which he took to be exemplified by the tragic poetry of\nancient Greece, was being born out of a rare cooperation between the\n\u201cDionysian\u201d spirit of ecstatic intoxication, which imbues\nthe work with vitality and passion, and the \u201cApollonian\u201d\nspirit of sober restraint, which tempers chaos with order and form\n(Nietzsche 1872 [1967]). William James (1842\u20131910) theorized\nabout creative genius exerts the causal power to change the course of\nhistory (Simonton 2018). This is just a glimpse of what each of these\nphilosophers had to say about creativity, and many other figures could\nbe added to their number.\n\nNevertheless, while some of the topics explored by earlier thinkers\nhave come to occupy a central place in philosophy today\u2014such as\nfreedom, justice, consciousness, and knowledge\u2014creativity is not\namong them. Indeed, \u201cphilosophy of creativity\u201d is still a\nneologism in most quarters, just as, for example, \u201cphilosophy of\naction\u201d and \u201cphilosophy of gender\u201d were not too long\nago. However, philosophical work on creativity has been picking up\nsteam over the last two decades (as shown, for example, in a few\nimportant collections of essays: B. Gaut & Livingston 2003;\nKrausz, Dutton, & Bardsley 2009; Paul & Kaufman 2014; B. Gaut\n& Kieran 2018). We\u2019ll now dive into those contributions,\nalong with earlier work, beginning with what is perhaps the most basic\nquestion one can ask in this field.\n",
