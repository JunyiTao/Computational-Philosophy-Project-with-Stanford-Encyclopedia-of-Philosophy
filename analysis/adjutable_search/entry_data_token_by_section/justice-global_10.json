    "main_text": "The Proper Use of Force, Military Intervention, and its Aftermath || Terrorism\n3.3 Terrorism\n\nWhat kinds of violence count as terrorism? Is there a difference\nbetween state terrorism and that perpetrated by insurgent\norganizations? Might terrorism be justified under certain\ncircumstances? Terrorism centrally involves either using or\nthreatening to use violence against people, commonly taken to be\ninnocent, in order to produce results that would not otherwise occur\n(Coady and O\u2019Keefe 2002; Primoratz 2013). Some challenge that\nthe targets are innocent. As terrorists often point out about citizen\ncomplicity in atrocities, citizens pay taxes and vote, and their\ngovernments undertake actions that they can be said to sanction and\nfrom which they benefit, so it is coherent to hold citizens\nresponsible for their governments\u2019 actions. On this argument,\ncitizens can be legitimate targets of violence. In addition, there is\nrelevant precedent from governments targeting civilians when they\nperceive the situation to be one of a \u201csupreme emergency\u201d,\nas happened in the case of Britain targeting German civilians in the\nSecond World War. So when governments judge that some moral disaster\nis sufficiently likely, it can be repelled using unorthodox and\notherwise repugnant means.\n",
