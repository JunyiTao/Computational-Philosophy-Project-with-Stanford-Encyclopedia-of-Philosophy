    "main_text": "\n\nNegative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints.\nOne has negative liberty to the extent that actions are available to\none in this negative sense. Positive liberty is the possibility of\nacting \u2014 or the fact of acting \u2014 in such a way as to take\ncontrol of one\u2019s life and realize one\u2019s fundamental\npurposes. While negative liberty is usually attributed to individual\nagents, positive liberty is sometimes attributed to collectivities, or\nto individuals considered primarily as members of given\ncollectivities.\n\nThe idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of\nthe term \u2018liberty\u2019 goes back at least to Kant, and was\nexamined and defended in depth by Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s and\n\u201960s. Discussions about positive and negative liberty normally\ntake place within the context of political and social philosophy. They\nare distinct from, though sometimes related to, philosophical\ndiscussions about\n free will.\n Work on the nature of positive liberty often overlaps, however, with\nwork on the nature of\n autonomy.\n\nAs Berlin showed, negative and positive liberty are not merely two\ndistinct kinds of liberty; they can be seen as rival, incompatible\ninterpretations of a single political ideal. Since few people claim to\nbe against liberty, the way this term is interpreted and defined can\nhave important political implications. Political\n liberalism\n tends to presuppose a negative definition of liberty: liberals\ngenerally claim that if one favors individual liberty one should place\nstrong limitations on the activities of the state. Critics of\nliberalism often contest this implication by contesting the negative\ndefinition of liberty: they argue that the pursuit of liberty\nunderstood as self-realization or as self-determination (whether of\nthe individual or of the collectivity) can require state intervention\nof a kind not normally allowed by liberals.\n\nMany authors prefer to talk of positive and negative freedom.\nThis is only a difference of style, and the terms\n\u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019 are normally used\ninterchangeably by political and social philosophers. Although some\nattempts have been made to distinguish between liberty and freedom\n(Pitkin 1988; Williams 2001; Dworkin 2011), generally speaking these\nhave not caught on. Neither can they be translated into other European\nlanguages, which contain only the one term, of either Latin or\nGermanic origin (e.g. libert\u00e9, Freiheit), where English\ncontains both.\n",
