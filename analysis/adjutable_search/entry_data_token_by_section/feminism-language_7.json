    "main_text": "Critical work on language and philosophy of language || Metaphor\n1.8 Metaphor\n\nFeminists have also devoted attention to another aspect of\nlanguage\u2014the use of metaphor (see the section Feminist Critiques\nand Conceptions of Objectivity in the entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science;\n and the entry on\n feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy).\n In particular, feminists have discussed the use of gendered metaphors\nin philosophy and in\n science.[4]\n Emily Martin (1991 [1996]) offers particularly vivid examples in her\ndiscussion of the use of gendered metaphors in discussions of human\nreproduction.\n\n\nAt its extreme, the age-old relationship of the egg and the sperm\ntakes on a royal or religious patina. The egg coat, its protective\nbarrier, is sometimes called its \u2018vestments\u2019, a term\nusually reserved for sacred, religious dress. The egg is said to have\na \u2018corona\u2019, a crown, and to be accompanied by\n\u2018attendant cells\u2019. It is holy, set apart and above, the\nqueen to the sperm\u2019s king. The egg is also passive, which means\nit must depend on the sperm for rescue. Gerald Schatten and Helen\nSchatten liken the egg\u2019s role to that of Sleeping Beauty:\n\u2018a dormant bride awaiting her mate\u2019s magic kiss, which\ninstills the spirit that brings her to life\u2019. Sperm, by\ncontrast, have a \u2018mission\u2019 which is to \u2018move through\nthe female genital tract in quest of the ovum\u2019. One popular\naccount has it that the sperm carry out a \u2018perilous\njourney\u2019 into the \u2018warm darkness\u2019, where some fall\naway \u2018exhausted\u2019. \u2018Survivors\u2019\n\u2018assault\u2019 the egg, the successful candidates\n\u2018surrounding the prize\u2019\u2026 (Martin 1996: 106)\n\n\nThe vision of reproduction suggested above is an inaccurate one. The\nsperm fails to behave in the single-minded manner suggested. Instead,\nthe \n\n\nsideways motion of the sperm\u2019s tail makes the head move sideways\nwith a force that is ten times stronger than its forward\nmovement\u2026in fact, its strongest tendency, by tenfold, is to\nescape by attempting to pry itself off the egg. (Martin 1996: 108)\n\n\n\nNor is the egg passive: adhesive molecules on its surface play a\ncrucial role in overcoming the sperm\u2019s tendency to pry itself\naway (Martin 1996: 108). Martin argues that scientists have been slow\nto discover these facts, partly due to the metaphors they employed;\nand that even as they have learned these facts they have been slow to\nupdate their metaphors. Gendered stereotypes, Martin suggests, can\nimpair our understanding of reproduction\u2014by leading scientists\nto employ misleading metaphors that conceal the truth. The use of\ngendered stereotypes in scientific imagery can also help to perpetuate\ndamaging stereotypes, for example by reinforcing the tendency to see\nfemales as passive. Martin\u2019s account has, however, been\nchallenged by Paul Gross (1998), who argues that scientists were not\nnearly so slow to these discoveries as Martin claimed. If Gross is\nright, then the problematic metaphors did not affect scientists\u2019\nwork in the ways suggested by Martin (though they do seem to have\naffected popular writing on the subject.)\n\nGendered metaphors have been used at many levels of discussion,\nincluding the most general. An important topic of feminist concern has\nbeen the historical tendency to conceive of the scientific endeavour\nin gendered ways. A particularly clear example comes from Francis\nBacon, discussed by both Evelyn Fox Keller and Genevieve Lloyd:\n\n\nFor Bacon, the promise of science is expressed as \u2018leading you\nto Nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make\nher your slave\u2019. (Keller 1996: 36.)\n\n\nThe tendency to describe nature in feminine terms is a long-standing\nand widespread one, well-documented in Lloyd (1984). Lloyd links this\nto a tendency to describe reason and the mind as male, and to contrast\nthese with supposedly feminine emotions and bodies. She argues that\nthese metaphors play a powerful role in the history of philosophy,\nshaping and often distorting our views both of reason, mind, emotion,\nand body and of men and women. Other important discussions of gendered\nmetaphors in philosophy include Irigaray (1974 [1985a], 1977 [1985b]),\nLe D\u0153uff (1980 [1990]), and Nye (1990, 1992).\n",
