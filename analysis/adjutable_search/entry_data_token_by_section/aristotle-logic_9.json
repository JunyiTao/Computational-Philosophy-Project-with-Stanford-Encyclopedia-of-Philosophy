Aristotle calls the\nterm shared by the premises the middle term\n(meson) and each of the other two terms in the premises an\nextreme (akron). The middle term must be\neither subject or predicate of each premise, and this can occur in\nthree ways: the middle term can be the subject of one premise and the\npredicate of the other, the predicate of both premises, or the subject\nof both premises.
