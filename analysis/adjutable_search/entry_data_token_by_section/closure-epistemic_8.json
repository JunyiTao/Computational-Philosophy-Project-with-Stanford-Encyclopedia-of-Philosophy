    "main_text": "The Argument From Not (Easily) Knowable Propositions || The Argument from Limiting Propositions\n4.1 The Argument from Limiting Propositions\n\nDretske did not clearly delineate the class of propositions he called\n\u201climiting\u201d (in 2003) or \u201cheavyweight\u201d (in\n2005). Some of the examples he provided are \u201cThere is a\npast,\u201d \u201cThere are physical objects,\u201d and \u201cI am\nnot being fooled by a clever deception.\u201d He appeared to think\nthat these propositions have a property we may call\n\u201celusiveness,\u201d where p is elusive for me if and\nonly if p\u2019s falsity would not change my experiences. But\nbeing limiting does not coincide with being elusive. If there were no\nphysical objects, my experiences would be changed dramatically, since\nI would not exist. So some limiting propositions are not elusive. As\nto whether all elusive claims are limiting, it is hard to say, because\nof the squishiness of the term \u201climiting\u201d.\nNot-mule is elusive, but is it limiting?\n\nCan\u2019t we know limiting propositions? If not, and if we do know things\nthat entail them, Dretske thought he had further support for his\nconclusive reasons view, assuming, as he did, that his view rules out\nour knowing limiting propositions (while allowing knowledge of things\nthat entail them). However, this assumption is false (Hawthorne 2005,\nLuper 2006). We do have conclusive reason to believe some limiting\npropositions, such as that there are physical objects. Still, Dretske\nmight abandon the notion of a limiting proposition in favor of the\nnotion of elusive propositions, and cite, in favor of his conclusive\nreasons view, and against K, the facts that we cannot know\nelusive claims but we can know things that imply them.\n\nIn order to rule out knowledge of limiting/elusive propositions,\nDretske offered two sorts of argument, which we may call the\nargument from perception and the argument from\npseudocircularity.\n\nThe argument from perception starts with the claims that (a) we do not\nperceive that limiting/elusive claims hold and (b) we do not know, via\nperception, that limiting/elusive claims hold. Since it is hard to see\nhow else we could know limiting/elusive propositions, (a) and (b) are\ngood grounds for concluding that we just do not know that they\nhold.\n\nThere is no doubt that (a) and (b) have considerable plausibility.\nNonetheless, they are controversial. To explain the truth of (a) and\n(b), Dretske counted on his conclusive reasons analysis of perception.\nHis critics may cite the safe indication account of perception as the\nbasis for rejecting (a) and (b). Luper (2006), for example, argues\nagainst both, chiefly on the grounds that we can perceive and know\nsome elusive claims (such as not-mule) indirectly, by\ndirectly perceiving claims (such as zeb) that entail\nthem.\n\nDretske suggested another reason for ruling out knowledge of\nlimiting/elusive claims. He thought we can know banal facts (e.g., we\nate breakfast) without knowing limiting/elusive claims they entail\n(e.g., the past is real) so long as those limiting/elusive\nclaims are true, but we cannot then turn around and employ\nthe former as our basis for knowing the latter. Suppose we take\nourselves to know some claim, q, by inferring it from another\nclaim, p, which we know, but our knowing p in the\nfirst place depends on the truth of q. Call this\npseudocircular reasoning. According to Dretske,\npseudocircular reasoning is unacceptable, and yet it is precisely what\nwe rely on when we attempt to know limiting/elusive claims such as\ndenials of skeptical hypotheses by deducing them from ordinary\nknowledge claims that entail them: we will not know the latter in the\nfirst place unless the former are true. The problem Dretske here\nraised was pressed earlier by critics of broadly reliabilist accounts\nof knowledge, such as Richard Fumerton (1995, 178). Jonathan Vogel\n(2000) discusses it under the heading bootstrapping, the\nprocedure employed when, e.g., someone who has no initial evidence\nabout the reliability of a gas gauge, comes to believe p on\nseveral different occasions because the gauge indicates p,\nand thereby knows p according to reliabilist accounts of\nknowledge, then infers that the gauge is reliable, by induction. By\nbootstrapping we may move\u2014illegitimately, according to\nVogel\u2014from beliefs formed through a reliable process to the\nknowledge that those beliefs were arrived at through a reliable\nprocess. One may know p using a gauge in the first instance\nonly if that gauge is reliable; hence, to conclude it is reliable\nsolely on the basis of its track record involves pseudocircular\nreasoning.\n\nTheorists have long objected to knowledge claims whose truth depends\non a fact that itself has not been established, especially if that\nfact is merely taken for granted. It is also standard to reject any\nknowledge claim whose pedigree smacks of circularity. Both worries\narise if we claim to know that one proposition, q, is true on\nthe grounds that it is entailed by a second proposition, p,\neven though the truth of q was taken for granted in coming to\nknow that p is true. Many theorists will reject\npseudocircular reasoning on precisely these traditional grounds.\nDretske did not share the first worry but he did raise the second, the\nconcern about pseudocircular reasoning. But there is a growing body of\nwork that breaks with tradition and defends some forms of epistemic\ncircularity (this work is heavily criticized, in turn, on the grounds\nthat it is open to versions of traditional objections). Max Black\n(1949) and Nelson Goodman (1955) were early examples; others include\nVan Cleve 1979 and 2003; Luper 2004; Papineau 1992; and Alston 1993.\nDretske himself meant to break with tradition, writing under the\nbanner of \u2018externalism.\u2019 He explicitly said that most, if\nnot all, of our mundane knowledge claims depend on facts we have not\nestablished. Indeed, he cited this as a virtue of his conclusive\nreasons view. Yet nothing in the nature of the conclusive reasons\naccount rules out our knowing limiting propositions using\npseudocircular reasoning, which leaves his reservations mysterious. A\nset of jar-ish experiences can constitute a conclusive reason for\nbelieving jar, a jar of cookies is in front of me. If I then\nbelieve objects, there are physical objects, because it is\nentailed by jar, I have conclusive reason for believing\nobjects, a limiting proposition. (If objects were\nfalse, jar would be too, and I would lack my jar-ish\nexperiences.)\n\nDretske might have fallen back on the view that the conclusive reasons\naccount rules out knowing elusive, as opposed to limiting, claims\nthrough pseudocircular reasoning, because we lack conclusive reasons\nfor elusive claims no matter what sort of reasoning we employ. But\nthis does not put Dretske\u2019s account at odds with pseudocircular\nreasoning. And even this more limited position can be challenged\n(adapting a charge against Nozick in Shatz 1987). We might insist that\np itself is a conclusive reason for believing q when\nwe know p and p entails q. After all,\nassuming p entails q, if q were false so\nwould p be. On this strategy we have a further argument for\nK: if S knows p (relying on some conclusive\nreason R), and S believes q because\nS knows p entails q, S has a\nconclusive reason for believing q, namely p (rather\nthan R), and hence S knows q.\n\nAnother doubt about knowing elusive claims deductively via mundane\nclaims is that this maneuver is improperly ampliative. Cohen claims\nthat knowing the table is red does not position us to know \u201cI am\nnot a brain-in-a-vat being deceived into believing that the table is\nred\u201d nor \u201cit\u2019s not the case that the table is white [but]\nilluminated by red lights\u201d (2002: 313). In the transition from\nthe former to the latter, our knowledge appears to have been amplified\nimproperly. This concern may be due at least in large part to lack of\nprecision in the application of entailment or deductive implication\n(Klein 2004). Let red be the proposition that the table is\nred, white the proposition that the table is white, and\nlight the proposition that the table is being illuminated by\na red light. Red does not entail anything about the\nconditions under which the table is illuminated. In particular it does\nnot entail the conjunction, light & not-white. The most\nwe can infer is that the conjunction, white & light, is\nfalse, and that gives us no information whatever about the lighting\nconditions of the table. One could as easily infer the falsity of the\nconjunction, white & not-light. No\namplification of the original known proposition, red, has\ncome about.\n",
