    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nNot very much is known of Falaquera\u2019s life, apart from his\nwritings. Most scholars believe that Falaquera was born and lived in\nSpain, but even this is not known with certainty (see Jospe, Torah\nand Sophia, 2\u20134). His approximate year of birth is\ncalculated from his comment in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh (9;\ntrans. 2), written in October-November 1263 (Heshvan 5024), that he\nhad passed the midpoint of seventy years and was approaching his\nfortieth year. His year of death is estimated from references in his\nlast known writing, the letter in defense of Maimonides\u2019 Guide of\nthe Perplexed.  The \u201cmidpoint\u201d of life, mentioned by\nFalaquera in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh, may have had some\nsignificance for him. He explains there (11; trans. 5):\n\n\nAfter his middle years, the rational soul awakens in him and converses\nwith him. At that time, the life of the body is on the decline and, as\nphysical existence approaches complete extinction, it descends lower\nand lower, while the soul rises higher and higher. Then the flames of\nconfusion are extinguished, and the sun of the eternal soul shines\nforth.\n\n\nWhether or not Falaquera himself went through some sort of mid-life\ncrisis, he tells us that his book is a \u201cbill of\ndivorcement\u201d from the poetry of his youth \u2013 an art in which,\nby his own account, he excelled and composed some 20,000 stanzas of\nrhymed verse, about half of which he wrote down. In the same breath he\nannounces his betrothal to wisdom, with the implication that a\nbigamous attachment to both poetry and wisdom is not desirable and\nshould not be tolerated. Falaquera\u2019s new attitude toward poetry\nreflects the concern with this art shared by ancient and medieval\nphilosophers: Poetry is dangerous because it persuades men not by its\ncontent and its truth, but by its beauty and eloquence (on Falaquera\u2019s\nattitude toward poetry, see Harvey, Falaquera\u2019s Epistle,\n128\u2013132). While Falaquera seems, for the most part, indeed to\nhave abandoned writing poetry, he was hardly faithful to her, even in\nhis youth. He openly acknowledges his flirtation with wisdom in\nSefer ha-Mevaqqesh, listing seven works that he calls\n\u201cthe progeny of my thoughts during my early years\u201d (12;\ntrans., 7\u20138). It is hard to know how seriously to take such\nproclamations, although it is certainly true that Falaquera\u2019s two\nlengthy philosophic works, the encyclopedic De\u2018ot\nha-Filosofim and his commentary on Maimonides\u2019 Guide of\nthe Perplexed, are not listed among these writings. The latter\nwork was written in 1280 (5040) (Moreh ha-Moreh, 365), and is\none of his most mature writings. Steinschneider wrote of\nthis work that the \u201cabundance of its citations was sufficient to\nconfer on those who copied from it the appearance of great\nerudition\u201d (Hebraeischen \u00dcbersetzungen, 422), and\nthe same can be said regarding the De\u2018ot\nha-Filosofim. An additional point of interest for Falaquera\u2019s\nbiography is his plaint in Sefer ha-Mevaqqesh (11\u201312; trans.,\n7\u20138) of the \u201cdifficult times under the powerful hand of the\nnon-Jewish nations who prevailed over us.\u201d This is a theme found\nin several of his works, and apparently the subject of his lost\nMegillat ha-Zikkaron. It is a stark reminder today of the\nbackground against which medieval Jewish thinkers such as Falaquera\nengaged in their writing and study.\n\n\nJospe makes a reasoned attempt at a chronology of Falaquera\u2019s\nwritings, based in part on Falaquera\u2019s listing in Sefer\nha-Mevaqqesh, but it is not completely convincing (Torah and\nSophia, 31\u201333). For example, it is not clear that\nFalaquera\u2019s listing of books is itself chronological and\ncomplete. Moreover, it is possible that a reference in one book to\nanother may be a later addition and not necessarily an indication of\nwhich book was written first. An important factor that must be\nconsidered in any future attempt to fix the chronology of Falaquera\u2019s\nwritings is the technical terms he uses and the wording of his\ntranslations from other authors. As Jospe himself points out in his\nbook, Falaquera paid great attention to terminology and chose his\nphilosophic terms carefully (18\u201329). He also, in the course of\nhis career, changed his preference for certain Hebrew words that\ntranslate key Arabic philosophic terms. This can be seen most clearly\nby comparing his different translations in different works of the same\nArabic passages. Consider, for example, Shelemut\nha-Ma\u2018asim, the first six chapters of which comprise an\nabridged Hebrew version of the Summa Alexandrinorum, an\nepitome of Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. The language here\ndiffers from Falaquera\u2019s citations from the Summa in his\nyouthful Sefer ha-Ma\u2018alot. On the other hand,\nFalaquera\u2019s citations from the Summa in the Moreh\nha-Moreh seem to be drawn from his own Shelemut\nha-Ma\u2018asim. Thus the Sefer ha-Ma\u2018alot was\nwritten before the Shelemut ha-Ma\u2018asim, which was\nwritten before the Moreh ha-Moreh.\n",
