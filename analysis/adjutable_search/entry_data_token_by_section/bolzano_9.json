    "main_text": "Logic || Bolzano\u2019s Definition of Logical Truth\n3.7 Bolzano\u2019s Definition of Logical Truth\n\nThe result of applying the operation of variation to a proposition\ndepends essentially on our choice of ideas to be varied in the\nproposition in question. And it can depend on matters of fact whether\nor not a proposition is universally valid (or contravalid) with\nrespect to a sequence \\(i\\) of ideas. Thus, e.g., it is due to the\nfact that every German is European and no German is American that the\nproposition [Every German philosopher is European] is universally\nvalid and the proposition [Every German philosopher is American] is\nuniversally contravalid with respect to [philosopher]. From a logical\npoint of view, the most interesting results will turn up if all\nextra-logical parts of a proposition, which are simple (or\n\u2014 as explained before \u2014 \u201crelatively\u201d simple),\nare taken to be variable (WL II, 84). To simplify matters, we will\nassume for what follows that for any proposition \\(s\\) there is always\nfixed a certain alphabetic order of all extra-logical simple ideas\ncontained in it; thereby, for every proposition \\(s\\), a sequence\n\\(i^{\\boldsymbol{s}}\\) of all extra-logical simple ideas contained in\n\\(s\\) is uniquely determined. It would appear that we now could define\nthe concepts of logico-universal validity and logico-universal\ncontravalidity in the following way: A proposition \\(s\\) is\nlogico-universally valid, or \u2014 put briefly \u2014 logically\ntrue, iff \\(s\\) is universally valid with respect to\n\\(i^{\\boldsymbol{s}}\\); \\(s\\) is logico-universally contravalid, or\n\u2014 put briefly \u2014 logically false, iff \\(s\\) is\nuniversally contravalid with respect to \\(i^{\\boldsymbol{s}}\\); \\(s\\)\nis logically analytic iff \\(s\\) logically true or logically\nfalse; and \\(s\\) is logically synthetic iff\\( s\\) is not\nlogically analytic.\n\nIn proceeding this way, however, we would have to face serious\nproblems concerning purely logical propositions, i.e., propositions\nall of whose parts are purely logical ideas. Due to our requirement\n(v) above concerning Bolzano\u2019s replacement operation, neither an\n\\(i\\)-variant in general nor an \\(i^s\\)-variant in particular is\ndefined for a purely logical proposition, since it does not contain\nany extra-logical idea. In consequence the preceding definitions of\nlogical truth, logical falsity and logical analyticity are not\napplicable to purely logical propositions, since they do not contain\nany extra-logical idea. Consider, however, the following three purely\nlogical propositions: [There is something, or it is not the case that\nthere is something], [There is something, and it is not the case that\nthere is something], and [There is something]. The first of these\nthree propositions is obviously logically true, the second one\nlogically false, and the third one is neither logically true nor\nlogically false. Giving up requirement (v), as some would like to have\nit, results in a purely logical proposition being its only own\n\\(i^{\\boldsymbol{s}}\\)-variant. That, however, would turn every purely\nlogical proposition either into a logical truth or into a logical\nfalsity according to our definition, in contrast to the fact that the\nproposition [There is something], i.e. [[something] has\nnon-emptiness], is not logically analytic; it is a truth of logic, but\nnevertheless not logically true (WL II, 375).\n\nA posssible way out of this dilemma is to choose the alternative\nprocedure sketched above (at the end of section 3.6) by taking these\nlogical properties primarily to be properties of propositional\nforms. Thereby the logical form of a proposition s\nis identified with the set of all of its\n\\(i^{\\boldsymbol{s}}\\)-variants; \\(F\\) is a logical propositional\nform therefore iff it is the logical form of at least one\nproposition. (Please note that according to this approach, the logical\nform of a purely logical proposition is not even defined;\nnevertheless, a purely logical proposition can be a member of\na logical propositional form.) We will define first the relevant\nproperties for propositional forms:\n\nA propositional form F is logically valid iff \\(F\\) is a\nlogical propositional form that is universally valid, i.e., at least\none of its members is true, and all of its members with non-empty\nsubject ideas are true.\n\n\n\\(F\\)is logically contravalid iff \\(F\\) is a logical\npropositional form, and all of its members are false.\n\n\nWe then define the corresponding properties for single\npropositions:\n\nA proposition \\(s\\) is logically true iff there is a\npropositional form \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) is logically valid and \\(s\\)\nis a member of \\(F\\).\n\n\n\\(s\\) is logically false iff there is a propositional form\n\\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) is logically contravalid and \\(s\\) is a member\nof \\(F\\).\n\n\\(s\\) is logically analytic iff \\(s\\) is logically true or\nlogically false.\n\n\\(s\\) is logically synthetic iff \\(s\\) is not logically\nanalytic.\n\n\nIt is easy to find an example of each of these kinds of propositions:\nthe proposition [Every German philosopher is German] is logically\ntrue, the proposition [Kant is German and Kant is non-German] is\nlogically false, and the proposition [Kant is a German philosopher] is\nlogically synthetic.
