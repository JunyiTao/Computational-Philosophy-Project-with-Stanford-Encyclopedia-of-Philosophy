    "main_text": "The Basic Idea\n2. The Basic Idea\n\nFrank Jackson (1982) formulates the intuition underlying his Knowledge\nArgument in a much cited passage using his famous example of the\nneurophysiologist Mary:\n\nMary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to\ninvestigate the world from a black and white room via a black and\nwhite television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of\nvision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information\nthere is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or\nthe sky, and use terms like \u2018red\u2019, \u2018blue\u2019, and\nso on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations\nfrom the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces\nvia the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal\nchords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the\nuttering of the sentence \u2018The sky is blue\u2019.\u2026 What\nwill happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is\ngiven a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or\nnot? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the\nworld and our visual experience of it. But then is it inescapable that\nher previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the\nphysical information. Ergo there is more to have than that,\nand Physicalism is false.\n\n\nThe argument contained in this passage may be put like this:\n\n(1) Mary has all the physical information concerning human color\nvision before her release.\n\n\n(2) But there is some information about human color vision that she\ndoes not have before her release.\n\nTherefore\n\n(3) Not all information is physical information.\n\n\nMost authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary,\nbut Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the\ncase of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human\nperceivers. We might want to know what color Fred experiences when\nlooking at things that appear to him in that particular way. It seems\nclear that no amount of knowledge about what happens in his brain and\nabout how color information is processed in his visual system will\nhelp us to find an answer to that question. In both cases cited by\nJackson, an epistemic subject A appears to have no access to\nparticular items of knowledge about a subject B: A\ncannot know that B has an experience of a particular quality\nQ on certain occasions. This particular item of knowledge\nabout B is inaccessible to A because\nA never had experiences of Q herself.\n",
