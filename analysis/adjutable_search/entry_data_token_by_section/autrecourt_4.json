    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n5. Metaphysics\n\n\nTo Bernard\u2019s skeptical challenges Autrecourt replies that sense\nexperience is reliable. This theme is not further developed in the\nletters to Bernard, however. For discussion of this topic we must turn\nto the Exigit ordo. In one section of this treatise, which is\nreminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics IV, 5, Autrecourt\naddresses one of the central issues of metaphysics, namely the relation\nbetween appearance and reality. He addresses Protagoras\u2019 view that\nwhatever is apparent is true: An omne illud quod apparet sit?\n(Does everything that appears exist?).\n\n\nAutrecourt defends the thesis that what appears, is, and that what\nappears true, is true. He finds this view more plausible than its\nopposite, viz., that the intellect cannot possess\ncertitude. Autrecourt does not have a meta-theory in which he defends\nhis model of certain knowledge against alternative theories. His\nappeal that his theory is the more probable one, however, saves him\nfrom charges of dogmatism. His concept of appearance plays a key role\nin his doctrine of certain knowledge. It is used in a phenomenological\nsense, to describe perceptual experiences. According to Autrecourt,\nthe intellect is certain of everything that is evident to it in the\nfinal analysis. This is the case for everything that appears in a\nproper sense (apparet proprie), i.e., that appears clearly in\nan act of the external senses (in actu sensuum\nexteriorum). He identifies appearances with the objects of\nimmediate sensory experience, which are considered evident. In this\nway, he implies that sense perception is a reliable source of truth,\ni.e., that the apparent properties of an object are its actual\nproperties.\n\n\nBut is sense perception reliable? Perceptual errors and dreams seem to\nindicate that things are not always as they seem. Autrecourt discusses\nseveral sceptical doubts (dubia), versions of what would\nlater be called the \u201cargument from illusion\u201d and the\n\u201cargument from dreaming\u201d. These arguments work from the\ncommon sense assumption that things often appear to be other than they\nare: e.g., sweet food can appear bitter, a white object can appear\nred, in sleep it can seem to someone that he is flying through the air\nor fighting the Saracens.\n\n\nAutrecourt responds to these sceptical doubts by distinguishing\nbetween appearance and judgment. Appearances are always veridical:\nexperience cannot be other than it is. However, judgments made from\nexperience can be erroneous, especially if they are based on images\nrather than on what is perceived \u201cin the full light.\u201d In\nother words, Autrecourt denies any conflict of appearances. Those not\n\u201cin the full light\u201d are not in themselves misperceptions\nbecause the experiences themselves are not illusory. They merely fail\nto give us the real properties of the object perceived. Potential\nconflict creeps in at the level of judgment, where ontological claims\nare made on the basis of appearances. Only those appearances that are\n\u201cin the full light\u201d reveal the true properties of the\nperceived object, and only they can provide the basis for true\njudgments. Appearances of objects that do not come to the perceiver\n\u201cin the full light\u201d are incomplete or contaminated, as if\nthe observer were looking into a mirror. In other words, Autrecourt\ncarefully distinguishes between \u2018x\nappears F\u2019 from \u2018x is F\u2019,\nfor even if x is not really F, it can still appear\nF and cause someone to believe that it is F. In this\nway, illusions and dreams turn into mistaken beliefs.  Only clear\nappearances (apparentiae clarae) can cause veridical\njudgments.\n\n\nA final topic taken up by Autrecourt in this context is the problem of\nthe criterion: How can one discriminate between appearances that\nprovide the basis for true judgments and those that do not? Like\nAristotle, he holds that appearances from what we perceive under\n\u201cnormal\u201d conditions cause true judgments. Also like Aristotle, he\nasserts that there is no further proof that the criterion on which the\ndistinction between veridical and false judgments rests is correct.\nBoth dismiss worries about the justification of the criterion as\nabsurd. In the words of Autrecourt: \u201cOne must accept as true what\nappears in the full light. Now, concerning the minor premise of this\nargument, how can you have certainty? \u2026 One way of answering\nthis would be to say that there is no way of proving the conclusion,\nbut that the concept of certitude which is present comes as a certain\nnatural consequence, and not as a conclusion. An example, among\nothers, is that white and black are different. This concept of their\ndifference is not gotten by way of conclusion.\u201d\n\n\nThe reason why our senses can give us veridical access to the objects\nis, because these objects determine the contents of what\nappears. Autrecourt believes that there is a necessary connnection\nbetween the mental act and the object of which it is a mental act. The\nobject \u201cconfigurates\u201d the mental act, which becomes identical to\nit. The metaphysical foundation of this theory is Autrecourt\u2019s\nrealism: he assumes that the same universal nature manifests itself in\nnumerically different objects in the world, and in the mind, although\nin the latter in a different mode of being (secundum aliud esse\nobjectivum) (Kaluza, 1998; Perler, in Caroti and Grellard,\n2006).\n",
