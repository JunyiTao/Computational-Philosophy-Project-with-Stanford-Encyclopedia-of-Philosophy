Neutral Monism\n1.1 Neutrality\n\nBoth of the terms that make up the label \u201cneutral monism\u201d\nare problematical. Because the questions to which the notion of\nneutrality gives rise are unique to neutral monism, they need to be\naddressed first. Most versions of neutral monism assume a plurality of\nbasic, neutral entities (these could be substances, events, tropes,\nuniversals, etc., depending on the specific form of the view). What\ndoes it mean for an entity to be neutral? Here are five proposals:\n\nThe Neither View: A basic entity is neutral just in case\nit is intrinsically neither mental nor physical.\nThe Actual Constituent View: A basic entity is neutral\njust in case it is a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities.\nThe Possible Constituent View: A basic entity is neutral\njust in case it can be a constituent of both physical and mental\nnon-basic entities.\nThe Law View: A basic entity is neutral just in case both\nmental laws and physical laws are applicable to it.\nThe Both View: A basic entity is neutral just in case it\nis intrinsically both mental and physical.\n\n\n(1)\u2013(5) are not always clearly distinguished; but even when they\nare, two or more of these criteria may be used concurrently. This\ninvites confusion on the part of the neutral monists, as well as their\ncritics.\n\nQuestions arise about the relationships between (1)\u2013(5). (1) and\n(5) are similar in letting the question of an entity\u2019s\nneutrality be settled by its intrinsic nature. (2)\u2013(4) answer\nthis question by looking at the relationships of a given entity to\nother things: to the nature of larger groups of entities of which the\ngiven entity is/can be a member: are these groups mental or material?\nOr by looking to the kinds of laws that govern the entity in question:\nare the laws mental or physical? If one is inclined to think that\nneutrality is a matter of intrinsic nature alone, (2)\u2013(4) will\nseem misguided. (2)\u2013(4) still might have a place as epistemic\ncriteria\u2014as ways of finding out whether a given entity is\nneutral. The friends of (1) and (5) can agree that a given\nentity\u2019s ability to actually or possibly belong to a certain\ngroup, or to be governed by certain laws, is due solely to its\nintrinsic nature. Their disagreement concerns only the question\nwhether this ability is conferred on that entity by its being both\nmental and physical or neither mental nor physical. In either case\n(2)\u2013(4) can only be used to discover which things are the\nneutral entities.\n\nThe traditional versions of neutral monism\u2014those developed by\nErnst Mach, William James, and Bertrand Russell\u2014accept (1) and\nreject (2). Russell, for instance, describes neutral monism as the\nview that \u201cboth mind and matter are composed of a neutral-stuff\nwhich, in isolation, is neither mental nor material\u201d (Russell\n1921: 25). But some critics of neutral monism, notably Bostock (2012:\n190, 195\u20136), interpret neutral monism as committed to (2). Based\non this interpretation of neutrality, Bostock arrives at the striking\nconclusion that \u201cRussell\u2019s version of neutral monism was\nnever properly \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018monistic\u2019\u201d\n(Bostock 2012: 190).\n\nIt can be argued that none of the traditional neutral monists accept\n(3). All of them would agree that neutral entities can be a\nconstituent of both physical and mental non-basic entities. But it is\ndoubtful whether any of them would agree that the fact that a basic\nentity can be a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities is sufficient to make it neutral. For it is conceivable that\na basic entity that fails to be neutral (according to (1), the\nNeither View) should figure in the construction of both\nphysical and mental non-basic entities.\n\n(4) is present in the thought of Mach and James. But it plays a\nprominent part in Russell\u2019s thought. In the opening chapter of\nhis 1921 The Analysis of Mind, Russell remarks:\n\nThere are, it seems to me, prima facie different kinds of\ncausal laws, one belonging to physics and the other to psychology. The\nlaw of gravitation, for example, is a physical law, while the law of\nassociation is a psychological law. Sensations are subject to both\nkinds of laws, and therefore are truly \u201cneutral\u201d in\n[Edwin] Holt\u2019s sense. But entities subject only to physical\nlaws, or only to psychological laws, are not neutral, and may be\ncalled respectively purely material and purely mental. (Russell 1921:\n25\u201326)\n\n\nHis use of (1) in conjunction with (4), especially in Russell 1921, is\nconfusing, and it has led a number of his critics (Stace 1946; Bostock\n2012) to argue that his neutral monism is best understood as a form of\ndualism (at least in his early writings).\n\nA more general issue with criteria (2)\u2013(4) is that they make\nneutral monism compatible with materialism, idealism, and/or dualism,\nas traditionally understood. So long as the basic entities, no\nmatter what their intrinsic nature may be, satisfy the criteria\nspecified in (2), (3), or (4) they are, according to these criteria,\nneutral. Gregory Landini, for instance, assumes that (3) captures\nRussell\u2019s idea of neutrality and concludes that he is a\nphysicalist and a neutral monist (Landini 2011: ch.6).\nAccording to Landini, Russell is a neutral monist because every basic\nentity can be a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities; and Russell is a physicalist because all basic entities of\nhis system are physical.\n\nThe traditional neutral monists reject (5), but many of their\nformulations suggest otherwise. It is easy to find passages saying\nthat a given neutral entity is both physical and mental:\n\nIf we admit\u2014as I think we should\u2014that the patch of color\nmay be both physical and psychical, the reason for distinguishing the\nsense-datum from the sensation disappears, and we may say that the\npatch of color and our sensation in seeing it are identical. (Russell\n1921: 143)\n\n\nA sympathetic reading of passages such as these suggests that they are\nbest understood as an abbreviated way of saying that the given neutral\nentity is a member of two groups of neutral entities, one of which\ncounts as physical, the other of which counts as mental. In fact, many\nneutral monists hold that the terms \u201cphysical\u201d and\n\u201cmental\u201d apply only to groups of neutral entities, not\nindividual ones:\n\nThe stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is, in my\nbelief, neither mind nor matter, but something more primitive than\neither. Both mind and matter seem to be composite, and the stuff of\nwhich they are compounded lies in a sense between the two, in a sense\nabove them both, like a common ancestor. (Russell 1921: 10\u201311)\n\n\nBut a number of contemporary discussions of neutral monism employ the\nBoth View. This view has, for instance, been attributed to\nThomas Nagel (Godfrey-Smith 2013: 1\u20132; Skrbina 2005:\n 237).[1]\n The Both View has the advantage of capturing one intuitive\nnotion of neutrality: that which is both mental and material is biased\ntowards neither and hence neutral between them.\n\nDespite this appeal, the Both View idea of neutrality\nconflates (or at least invites conflation of) neutral monism with\nother theories from which it should be distinguished. Indeed,\ndepending on how the claim that the basic entities are intrinsically\nboth mental and physical is understood, neutral monism becomes\ndifficult to distinguish from panpsychism, dual-aspect theory, and\neven the identity theory\u2014since \u201cbeing a pain\u201d and\n\u201cbeing a c-fiber stimulation\u201d, for example, pick out the\nvery same property, aspect, or state rather than two distinct and\nirreducible ones (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.6 below). In contrast,\nthe Neither View idea of neutrality allows us to understand\nneutral monism as a distinct type of theory, and so is in this respect\npreferable.\n\nThere are, however, a number of complications shared by (1)\u2013(5).\nFor one thing, they all use the concepts \u201cmental\u201d and\n\u201cphysical\u201d to specify the notion of neutrality. And since\nthese terms are used in different ways, the notion of the neutral\nvaries accordingly. In the case of the term \u201cmental\u201d, most\nneutral monists understand it as picking out entities in terms of\nfeatures traditionally associated with mental phenomena, such as\nintentionality, experientiality, subjectivity, qualitativity, unity,\npurposiveness, and so on. But there are diverging views among neutral\nmonists about which of these features are unique to and/or possessed\nby mental phenomena. Similarly, there is no consensus about whether\nthe term \u201cphysical\u201d is restricted to those aspects of\nreality that can be fully captured by the descriptions of physics or\nextends beyond such descriptive resources (Stoljar 2001). And while\nsome use the terms \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d\ninterchangeably, others see \u201cmaterial\u201d as applying to\nentities with the features traditionally ascribed to matter (such as\noccupying space, crowding out other such entities, and enduring\nthrough changes in features) whereas \u201cphysical\u201d might pick\nout entities lacking one or more of them. Most pressingly, if\n\u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d are defined as\ncomplements of each other, thereby ruling out the possibility of\nentities to which neither term applies, then there cannot be\nany neutral entities (at least in the neither sense).\n\nAnother worry is that (1)\u2013(4) don\u2019t say anything about the\nnature of the neutral entities. (1) says only what they are not;\n(2)\u2013(4) specify certain roles that neutral entities can play,\nwithout telling us anything about the nature of the role occupants.\n(5) may fare better in this regard; but it arguably cannot distinguish\nbasic neutral entities from those of panpsychism, dual-aspect\ntheory, or the identity theory. Some versions of neutral monism\nembrace this agnosticism about the nature of the neutral base. But\nothers have been more forthcoming, offering examples of neutral\nentities with which we are familiar.\n\nThe three traditional neutral monists\u2014Ernst Mach, William James,\nand Bertrand Russell\u2014all pointed to entities encountered in\nexperience as examples of neutral phenomena. Mach speaks of\n\u201csensations\u201d, James of \u201cpure experience\u201d, and\nRussell of \u201csensations\u201d and \u201cpercepts\u201d.\nPredictably, this has fueled the suspicion that neutral monism is\nnothing but rebranded phenomenalism. Others have sought the neutral\nbase in the realm of the abstract. Kenneth Sayre, for example, turns\nto the mathematical theory of information and suggests that the\nneutral base is to be understood as the \u201contology of\ninformational states\u201d (Sayre 1976: 16) that this theory\npresupposes (see section 5.1 below). What is clear is that it is no\neasy task to characterize basic entities in a way that is both\nsubstantive and incontrovertibly neutral.\n1.2 Monism\n\nThere is, then, considerable disagreement about how to interpret the\nnotion of neutrality. The notion of monism raises its own problems.\nBut as these are questions faced by all forms of monism, they are,\nperhaps, not quite as pressing. As with the case of the notion of\nneutrality employed, it is possible to distinguish different versions\nof neutral monism based on the various ways they understand the notion\nof monism (see Schaffer 2016). Neutral monism might, for example, be\ninterpreted as a form of existence monism\u2014the view that only a\nsingle concrete thing exists; but it might also interpreted as a\nmonism about the kinds of things there are\u2014the view that\nconcrete things, be they simple or complex, are of the same neutral\nkind. The evidence suggests that all past and present versions of\nneutral monism have been pluralist on both these counts: they work\nwith a plurality of basic neutral entities; and, given their focus on\nthe mind-body problem, they recognize at least mental and physical\nkinds of entities in addition to the neutral ones (though some\ndescribe them as useful fictions). All entities belonging to such\nnon-neutral kinds must, however, count as derivative. In the final\nanalysis, all entities must be basic neutral entities or complexes of\nsuch entities.\n\nThe talk about basic entities indicates another pluralist dimension:\nthe known versions of neutral monism work with a layered picture of\nreality. Basic neutral entities form the bottom level of the\nhierarchy; the non-basic, non-neutral entities at the higher levels\nare composed of, or are in some sense derivative from, those lower\nlevel neutral entities. So we are dealing with an ontology that\nrecognizes a plurality of levels or layers in reality.\n\nAnd even within the level of the basic neutral entities we can\ndistinguish those versions of neutral monism that hold that all basic\nentities belong to a single category, from those that distinguish two\nor more categories of neutral entities. Russell\u2019s later version\nof neutral monism seems to be monistic (in this particular sense): all\nneutral entities are\n events.[2]\n But it is easy to envision a neutral monism that countenances neutral\nsubstances and neutral properties among the basic neutral\n entities.[3]\n1.3 Mind and Matter Revisited\n\nMost extant versions of neutral monism seem to acknowledge that, in\naddition to the basic neutral entities, there exist derivative,\nnon-basic, and non-neutral ones\u2014mental and physical entities,\nfor example. This raises the question about the relationship between\nthese two kinds of entities. Every answer to this question faces two\nchallenges. On the one hand there is the threat of elimination of the\nnon-basic entities (see section 4.1); on the other hand there is the\nthreat that the non-basic, non-neutral entities turn into elements of\nultimate reality, thereby putting an end to neutral monism.\n\nThe question of the relationship between basic and non-basic entities\nis a contested topic among the traditional neutral monists (Wishon\n2021). James holds that \u201cpure experience\u201d constitutes an\ninterconnected continuum out of which different portions become\n\u201cmental\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d depending on their\ncontext, their relations to other such portions, and the purposes they\nserve and/or effects they result in (see 2.2 below). In contrast, Mach\nand Russell arguably hold that the non-basic entities are composed\nof\u2014or perhaps merely practical groupings of\u2014a multitude of\ndiscrete neutral entities organized by physical and/or psychological\ncausal-functional relations.\n\nMost contemporary neutral monists agree that the basic neutral\nentities are related to the non-basic, non-neutral ones by way of\ngrounding relations. But many questions remain about the precise\nnature of these grounding relations and of their relata. In any case,\nneutral monists face the daunting challenge of explaining (or\nexplaining away) the features associated with both mental and physical\nentities solely in terms of the basic neutral ones, their aspects, and\ntheir relations.\n2. Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632\u201377) and David Hume (1711\u201376) are\noften identified as the originators of neutral\n monism.[4]\n The case for including Spinoza runs as follows:\n\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics of substance has been called neutral\nmonism; it is a form of monism because it allows for only one\nsubstance, and it is neutral because he describes the one substance as\nboth a body and a mind. (Rosenkrantz and Hoffman 2011: 287)\n\n\nTo classify Spinoza as an existence monist may be permissible. But the\nneutrality claim is based on the problematical both view of\nneutrality. This suggests that it is best to classify Spinoza as a\ndouble aspect theorist. Hume\u2019s case is more difficult to assess.\nIt has been said that the prevalent 20th century\ninterpretation of Hume has been neutral monist (see Flage 1982: 527).\nH.H. Price\u2019s case for this view has been particularly\ninfluential (see Price 1932: 105\u20136). On the other hand, the\nneutral monist interpretation of Hume has been vigorously resisted\n(Flage 1982; Backhaus 1991).\n\nIn light of these difficulties it is best to start the genealogy of\nneutral monism with the big three: Ernst Mach, William James,\nand Bertrand Russell. Of the three, only Russell uses the label\n\u201cneutral monism\u201d (a term seemingly coined by his teacher\nJames\n Ward).[5]\n But there is widespread agreement that Mach, James, and Russell are\nthe three most important philosophers in this tradition. A striking\nfeature of traditional neutral monism\u2014a reflection of the\nempiricist leanings of its protagonists\u2014is the close tie between\nthe neutral entities and experience. This connection has given rise to\none of the most enduring criticisms of neutral monism: that it\ncollapses into phenomenalism. It is therefore important to note that\nthis salient feature of traditional neutral monism need be no part of\nit.\n2.1 Ernst Mach\n\nErnst Mach (1838\u20131916) occupies a central position in the\nhistory of neutral monism. He influenced William James and Bertrand\nRussell and, through them, all of the writers on neutral monism in the\nEnglish-speaking world. His importance for the development of the view\nin the German-speaking world is hard to overestimate. Among the\nphilosophers to build on Mach\u2019s ideas was Rudolf Carnap in his\nAufbau (1928). As a physicist who also did physiological and\npsychological research, Mach strove to adopt an inclusive and\neconomical framework that would allow him to pursue all of these\ninquiries in a unified and coherent fashion. In the simple components\nof experience\u2014colors, sounds, pressures, intensities, times,\nspaces, motor sensations, etc.\u2014he finds typical examples of a\nmuch larger group of elements whose functional interrelations are\nstudied by the various sciences (see Banks 2014, ch. 1 on the resolute\nrealism of Mach\u2019s view). While a given element is,\nintrinsically, neither mental nor physical, the various groups to\nwhich it belongs may display functional relationships that are\ncharacteristic of physics or of psychology. In this case the neutral\nelement forms part of the subject matter of physics and of psychology,\nrespectively. In the following quotation Mach uses a color and our\nperception of it to illustrate this point. A single neutral\nelement\u2014the color\u2014gets to be both the physical color of a\nphysical object and our mental perception/sensation of it. The color\ncan be called physical, qua constituent of the one group, and\nmental, qua constituent of the other group, but is the same\nunchanging and intrinsically neutral element that figures in these two\ndifferent contexts:\n\nThus the great gulf between physical and psychological research\npersists only when we acquiesce in our habitual stereotyped\nconceptions. A color is a physical object as soon as we consider its\ndependence, for instance, upon its luminous source, upon other colors,\nupon temperatures, upon spaces, and so forth. When we consider,\nhowever, its dependence upon the retina\u2026it is a psychological\nobject, a sensation. Not the subject matter, but the direction of\ninvestigation, is different in the two domains. (Mach 1886:\n17\u201318)\n\n\nIn this way material objects and the ego are dissolved into\nelements/sensations that are related in certain complex ways. Spelled\nout for material objects, this reads:\n\nthing, body, matter, are nothing apart from the combinations of the\nelements,\u2014the colors, sounds, and so forth\u2014nothing apart\nfrom their so-called attributes. (Mach 1886: 7)\n\n\nAnd the fate of the ego is similar:\n\nThe primary fact is not the ego, but the elements\n(sensations)\u2026The elements constitute the I. I have the\nsensation green, signifies that the element green occurs in a given\ncomplex of other elements (sensations, memories). When I\ncease to have the sensation green, when I die, then the\nelements no longer occur in the ordinary, familiar association. That\nis all. Only an ideal mental-economical unity, not a real unity, has\nceased to exist. (Mach 1886: 23\u201324)\n\n\nFor Mach the world presents itself as \u201ca viscous mass [of\nelements], at certain places (as in the ego) more firmly coherent than\nin others\u201d (Mach 1886: 17). The neutral elements (only a minute\nfraction of which are sensations) and their relations are the basic\nreality. We draw boundaries around certain groups of elements that are\nrelated to each other in interesting ways, because this serves our\nbiological, scientific, and/or practical purposes. We can continue to\ntalk about material things and selves; it is economical to do so. But,\nstrictly speaking, \u201cboth [object and ego] are provisional\nfictions of the same kind\u201d (Mach 1905: 9).\n\nThe primary source for Mach\u2019s views on neutral monism are a\nnumber of essays and chapters contained in his books originally\npublished in 1883, 1886, 1894, and 1905. The size of these books grew\nsignificantly as they went through numerous editions. Some of the\nimportant papers on neutral monism are not contained in the available\nEnglish translations of these works.\n2.2 William James\n\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910) uses the term \u201cradical\nempiricism\u201d for the view he sets forth in James 1912\u2014the\nview that has become a paradigm of neutral monism. His critique of the\nrelational account of experience\u2014according to which the self\ndirects an act onto an object\u2014was the model upon which Russell\nlater shaped his analysis of experience. James presents this argument\nas an attack on a particular conception of consciousness present in\nvarious forms in the Neo-Kantian, early analytic, and phenomenological\ntraditions. Roughly, it is the notion of consciousness as a diaphanous\nor transparent relation, medium, or container by means of which the\nobjects of consciousness are presented or represented to us. But the\nconsciousness that makes this kind of object presentation possible\neludes our grasp. This thin notion of consciousness is the one James\nwants to eliminate:\n\nI believe that \u2018consciousness,\u2019 when once it has\nevaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of\ndisappearing altogether. It is the name of a nonentity, and has no\nright to a place among first principles. Those who still cling to it\nare clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumor left behind by the\ndisappearing \u2018soul\u2019 upon the air of philosophy. (James\n1904b: 2)\n\n\nHis radical proposal is to simply discard this shadowy something and\nto make do with what remains, with what used to be the object of the\nconscious act. He introduces the term \u201cpure experience\u201d to\nstand for this datum. Prior to any further categorization, pure\nexperience is, according to James, neutral\u2014neither mental nor\nphysical:\n\nThe instant field of the present is at all times what I call the\n\u2018pure\u2019 experience. It is only virtually or potentially\neither object or subject as yet. For the time being, it is plain,\nunqualified actuality, or existence, a simple that. (James 1904b: 23)\n\n\nMind and matter, knower and known, thought and thing, representation\nand represented are then interpreted as resulting from different\nfunctional groupings/carvings of the continuous flux of pure\nexperience for different purposes (see James 1905: 64).\n\nIn perceptual knowledge perceiver and perceived fuse or merge (James\nuses both terms): one bit of pure experience is the thing perceived as\nwell as the perceiving of this thing. The difference lies only in how\nthis single portion of pure experience is related to other portions of\npure experience:\n\nThe paper seen and the seeing of it are only two names for one\nindivisible fact which, properly named, is the datum, the\nphenomenon, or the experience. The paper is in the mind and the\nmind is around the paper, because paper and mind are only two names\nthat are given later to the one experience, when, taken in a larger\nworld of which it forms a part, its connections are traced in\ndifferent directions. To know immediately, then, or intuitively,\nis for mental content and object to be identical. (James 1895:\n110)\n\n\nConceptual knowledge is more complex. In the simplest case of\nconceptual representation we are dealing with\n\ntwo pieces of actual experience belonging to the same\nsubject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience\nbetween them. (James 1904a: 53)\n\n\nThe first piece of pure experience is the thought\u2014the episode of\nthinking as well as the content that is thought\u2014perhaps about\nHarvard\u2019s Memorial Hall, as in James\u2019s famous example (see\nJames 1904a: 55ff). And, in the simplest case, the second piece of\npure experience is the thing\u2014Memorial Hall\u2014that was\nthought of, as well as the perceiving of Memorial Hall. The thought\nhas, let\u2019s suppose, led us to Memorial Hall and now we stand in\nfront of it and see it. It is this function of leading (about\nthe details of which James has much to say) that constitutes the\nthought\u2019s intentionality, that constitutes the fact that the\nthought was a thought about a certain thing. Once the thought has led\none to the Hall,\n\nthe percept not only verifies the concept, proves its\nfunction of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept\u2019s\nexistence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries\ncreates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was,\nbecause it now proves itself to be, what the concept \u2018had in\nmind\u2019. (James 1904a: 60\u20131)\n\n\nThis is James\u2019s way of reconstructing the idea of representation\nin a way that does not invoke suspect mental powers of intrinsic\nintentionality. He values this as a signal achievement of his radical\nempiricism:\n\nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in\nthe fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\nrepresentative, not in any quasi-miraculous\n\u2018epistemological\u2019 sense, but in the definite practical\nsense of being its substitute in various operations,\nsometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to its\nassociates and results. (James 1904a: 61)\n\n\nNot all conceptual experience results in knowledge. If the process of\nleading does not get started, or fails to arrive at an experience of\ntermination, there is nothing that the first piece of experience gets\nto know. In that case the representation is empty or false.\n\nThe essays in which James sets out his radical empiricism are among\nthe most influential and most readable documents of the neutral\nmonistic literature. It is probably fair to say that James converted\nRussell to neutral monism. And his influence on American neutral\nmonists during the early decades of the twentieth century is massive\n(see 2.4 below). The primary source for James\u2019s views on neutral\nmonism are the essays collected in his 1912.\n2.3 Bertrand Russell\n\nFollowing a series of critical engagements with neutral monism (see\nespecially Russell 1914a,b), Russell adopted it in 1918 and remained a\nneutral monist for the rest of his long career: \u201cI am conscious\nof no major change in my opinions since the adoption of neutral\nmonism\u201d is what he says in an interview from 1964 (Eames 1969:\n108). But the question of whether Russell\u2019s neutral monism is\nbest seen as a single theory or as a sequence of related but\nsignificantly different theories, as well as the question of which, if\nany, of these different doctrines should count as versions of neutral\nmonism, have been much debated (see Wishon 2015; Pincock 2018; Bostock\n2012; Stace 1946). Russell\u2019s 1919 and 1921 are generally\nconsidered to represent the early versions of his neutral monism.\nRussell\u2019s 1927a and 1927b contain the mature doctrine. In his\nlater works\u2014Russell 1948 and 1956a\u2014he no longer used the\nterm \u201cneutral monism\u201d. But the doctrine seems largely\nunchanged.\n\nHere is a succinct first pass at describing the core of\nRussell\u2019s neutral monism:\n\nRussell argued that the traditional distinction between\n\u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d is unfounded and that the\nsubject matter of both physics and psychology concerns collections of\ncausally ordered events in space-time. Some of these events, ones\noccurring in the brains of complex creatures like us, are the mental\nepisodes that we are directly aware of in having conscious experience.\nThese very same events can also be described in abstract structural\nterms by physics and neuroscience. Regarding the rest of the\n(extracranial) events in nature, Russell maintained that our knowledge\nof them is indirect and limited entirely to the abstract structural\ndescriptions provided by the various physical sciences. (Wishon 2016:\n64)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this brief summary leaves out many key details that\nare important for understanding the character of Russell\u2019s\nneutral monism.\n2.3.1 Logical Constructionism and Neutral Monism\n\nWhen Russell looks at neutral monism, he sees a theory that embodies\nthe spirit of the \u201csupreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophising\u201d (Russell 1914c: 155) in an especially striking\nway. This maxim is Occam\u2019s Razor: entities are not to be\nmultiplied without necessity. In one of Russell\u2019s formulations\nit reads: \u201cWherever possible, substitute constructions out of\nknown entities for inferences to unknown entities\u201d (Russell\n1924: 326). Known entities are those that we know directly or\nnoninferentially; unknown entities are ones we accept only on the\nbasis of inferences from known entities. Russell\u2019s maxim\nencourages us to discover complex structures of known entities that\ncan play the role the inferred entities were supposed to play. Upon\nsubstituting these complex structures\u2014the\nconstructions\u2014for the inferred entities, everything continues to\nwork as before. The point of this complicated procedure is primarily\nepistemic: we are now no longer burdened with the risky inference to\nthe inferred entities, and thus the risk of error is reduced. Strictly\nspeaking, Russell remains agnostic as to the existence of the original\nentities targeted by the construction. They are neither identified\nwith nor eliminated by the corresponding construction. Still, the\nconstructions make it possible to arrive at a simplified account of\nwhat there is that fits our empirical evidence and exhibits various\nother theoretical virtues such as greater continuity, causal\nuniformity, and so on. Thus, the resulting metaphysical theory\ndeserves our provisional assent over competing ones to a degree\nproportional to such non-demonstrative grounds.\n\nNeutral monism holds out the alluring promise that such constructions\ncan be found for all of the inferred entities of physics, psychology,\nand common sense. All of these bodies of knowledge are preserved, but\nat a hugely reduced epistemic cost. These are the considerations that\ndrive Russell to embrace neutral monism: it is a perfect fit with his\nlongstanding commitment to the program of logical construction. An\nadded benefit of substituting constructions of neutral entities for\nphysical and mental entities is an elegant solution to the mind-body\nproblem.\n\nLogical construction is a process of discovery, not of manipulation:\nto logically construct xs out of ys is to discover\nthat ys, when they manifest a certain type of structure, can\nplay the role of xs. Russell\u2019s constructions of a point\nin space, an instant in time, a table, and of a belief may illustrate\nthe procedure. (i) A Russian doll is a good model of how Russell\n(following Whitehead) proposes to construct a point in space. The\nrough idea is to take \u201cthe class of all those objects which, as\none would naturally say, contain the point\u201d (Russell 1914a: 117)\nand to substitute this class of nested objects (the structure of\nys) for points in space (the xs). (ii) Experienced\ninstants in time (the xs) are constructed by discovering that\nthe experiences of a person, each of which is extended in time, can\noverlap each other in ways that converge on an instant. It is\n\na group of events, all belonging to his experience, and having the\nfollowing two properties: (1) any two of the events overlap; (2) no\nevent outside the group overlaps with every member of the group.\n(Russell 1927b: 288)\n\n\n(iii) Rather than viewing a table as the cause of our table\nsensations, Russell proposes (again just as a first approximation) to\nview the table as \u201cthe set of all those particulars which would\nnaturally be called \u2018aspects\u2019 of the table from different\npoints of view\u201d (Russell 1921: 98). (iv) The logical\nconstruction that is to take the place of beliefs consists of the\nfollowing three components:\n\nWe have a proposition, consisting of interrelated images, and possibly\npartly of sensations; (b) we have the feeling of assent, which is\npresumably a complex sensation demanding analysis; (c) we have a\nrelation, actually subsisting, between the assent and the proposition,\nsuch as is expressed by saying that the proposition in question is\nwhat is assented to. (Russell 1921: 251)\n\n\nAs these examples show, there is no single method of construction, no\nsingle type of structure, suitable for different projects of logical\nconstruction. The nature of the xs (the targets of\nconstruction) and of the ys (the construction materials)\nguide the search for structures that will work in the case at\nhand.\n2.3.2 Known Neutral Entities\n\nThe initial stock of known entities with which Russell proposes to\ncarry out this grand project of logical construction seems frightfully\nsmall and strikingly non-neutral. It consists of his sensations and\nimages\u2014these loom large in Russell 1919, 1921\u2014and his\nperceptions (percepts)\u2014these play a prominent role in Russell\n1927a, 1927b, 1948. Everything else\u2014electrons, apples, galaxies,\nexperiences, and selves, etc.\u2014is in need of logical\nconstruction.\n\nFor an entity to be neutral is to \u201chave neither the hardness and\nindestructibility of matter, nor the reference to objects which is\nsupposed to characterize the mind\u201d (Russell 1921: 36; cf. 124).\nRussell never suspected sensations of being material (in this sense).\nThat sensations contain a mental element (in this sense)\u2014that\nthey consist of a mental act of sensing directed at a non-mental\nobject\u2014was, however, a pivotal part of his earlier view. But\nthen his views changed:\n\nI formerly believed that my own inspection showed me the distinction\nbetween a noise [the object] and my hearing of a noise [the act of\nsensing], and I am now convinced that it shows me no such thing, and\nnever did. (Russell 1918b: 255)\n\n\nAll that Russell now finds upon introspecting a sensory episode is a\nsingle item: a sensory quality \u201cwhich may be called\nindifferently a noise or hearing a noise\u201d (Russell 1918b: 255).\nSwitching the example to colors, he writes that\n\nthe sensation we have when we see a patch of colour simply is\nthat patch of colour\u2026the patch of colour and our sensation in\nseeing it are identical. (Russell 1921: 142\u20133)\n\n\nAnd since noises and patches of color are not intentional\u2014they\nare not directed at anything, they are simply there\u2014they are\nintrinsically non-mental. They constitute \u201csensations\u201d\nonly when related to other such entities in an organized system such\nthat they play the right causal role (Russell 1996; Wishon\n2020, 2021). This establishes the neutrality of sensations. And\nbecause images have the same intrinsic nature as sensations (cf.\nRussell 1921: 117, 121, 154, 156, 287, 297), they too are\n neutral.[6]\n Percepts are composed of elements playing the roles of sensations and\nimages and are likewise intrinsically neutral.\n2.3.3 More Neutral Entities: Realism\n\nRussell\u2019s focus on sensations, images, and percepts explains why\nRussell\u2019s neutral monism has often been dismissed as a form of\nphenomenalism. But in the preceding section we have seen how Russell\nargued for the intrinsic nonmentality of these items. Moreover, this\ncriticism overlooks that Russell worked with a vastly expanded set of\nconstruction materials. He allows for the enlargement of the realm of\nthe known by a series of cautious\n inferences.[7]\n In a first step he argues that \u201call our percepts are composed\nof imperceptible parts\u201d and have imperceptible structure\n(Russell 1927a: 282, 386; Wishon 2020, 2021); second, there are\nsensations, images, and percepts that are not our own; third, and most\nimportantly, we can infer the existence of vast numbers of entities\nthat \u201cdo not form part of any experience\u201d (Russell 1921:\n 25).[8]\n In this way Russell arrives at the view \u201cthat the world is very\nfull of events\u201d (Russell 1927a: 258), only a vanishingly small\nnumber of which are his own experiences.\n\nOur own percepts, images, and\n sensations[9]\n occupy a privileged place in this system of entities\u2014they are\n\u201cwhat is most indubitable in our knowledge of the world\u201d\n(Russell 1927b: 139). This knowledge is of a \u201cmore intimate\nqualitative\u201d (Russell 1927a: 389) kind; it reveals something of\nthe intrinsic character of these\n entities.[10]\n But our knowledge of the physical world [as described by physical\nscience] is (almost) entirely abstract: \u201cwe know certain logical\ncharacteristics of its structure, but nothing of its intrinsic\ncharacter\u201d (Russell 1927b:\n 306\u2013307).[11]\n In this sense, physics merely describes the \u201ccausal skeleton of\nthe world\u201d and leaves us in the dark as to the intrinsic quality\nof the events that make it up (Russell 1927a: 388, 391).\n\nRussell takes all of these different entities to be neutral (in the\nsense of the Neither View); and he takes all of them to be\n events[12],\n where an event is understood as \u201csomething occupying a small\nfinite amount of space\u2013time\u201d (Russell 1927b: 287). The\nnoise and the color patch considered above are typical examples of\nevents. A Russellian event is absolute, in C.D. Broad\u2019s sense:\n\u201cit should not itself be a state of invariance or of\nchange in the qualities or relationships of any thing\u201d (Broad\n1959: 739; see also Maxwell 1978: 385\u20136 on pure events).\nAccording to Russell, physics teaches that events \u201cjust happen,\nand do not happen \u2018to\u2019 matter or \u2018to\u2019 anything\nelse\u201d (Russell 1927b: 289). This means that we must not think of\nmental events (or any events) \u201cas consisting of motions of bits\nof matter\u201d (Russell 1927b: 292), for \u201cmatter in\nmotion\u2026is not an event in our sense\u201d (Russell 1927b:\n296).\n\nRussell\u2019s neutral monist universe is a plenum of (absolute)\nevents\u2014a vast assemblage of overlapping small occurrences which,\ngiven their short lifespan, are constantly replaced by new ones. This\nmass of ever-changing events manifests all sorts of complex dynamic\npatterns. We have not yet discovered the laws that govern these events\nand give rise to the formation of these complex dynamic patterns. But\nwe have physics, which describes the behavior of certain groups of\nlaw-governed events under the name of \u201cmatter\u201d. And we\nhave psychology, which describes a set of quite different regularities\nthat obtain in very specific regions of this plenum of\nevents\u2014viz. in those regions that are filled by the pieces of\nmatter that are called \u201cbrains\u201d. But all the building\nblocks of the logical constructions that are matter, and all the\nbuilding blocks of the logical constructions that are mental episodes,\nhave the same nature\u2014they are neutral events.\n2.4 Some Other Early Neutral Monists\n\nThere are, of course, many other philosophers whom one might want to\ninclude in the list of neutral monists. In the German-speaking world,\nwe find Richard Avenarius (1843\u201396), who was in contact with\nMach, and Joseph Petzoldt (1862\u20131929), who built on the work of\nAvenarius. Avenarius\u2019s main reflections on neutral monism are\ncontained in his 1888/90, 1891, and 1894/95. Petzoldt\u2019s relevant\nworks are his 1900, 1904 and 1906. In the English-speaking world,\nneutral monism thrived within the movement of American new realism.\nArguably, John Dewey (1859\u20131952) was the most eminent figure in\nthis group of neutral monists, but Ralph Barton Perry\n(1876\u20131957)\u2014a student and friend of James\u2014is the one\nmost closely associated with the\n view.[13]\n Perry\u2019s 1912 is the main source for his views about neutral\nmonism. Edwin B. Holt (1873\u20131946) developed an ambitious neutral\nmonist program in his 1912 and 1914. Other notable early neutral\nmonists include Alois Riehl (1844\u20131924), Alexander Bogdanov\n(1873\u20131928), Moritz Schlick (1882\u20131936), and (for a time)\nRudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970) and Alfred Ayer (1910\u201389), among\nothers.\n3. The Case for Neutral Monism\n\nThe case for neutral monism is best made by enumerating its\nvirtues.\n3.1 Parsimony\n\nFor starters, neutral monism shares the virtues of idealism and\nmaterialism in pairing down the kinds of basic entities to which we\nmust be committed. Whereas dualism posits that there are basic\nentities of two fundamentally different kinds\u2014matter and\nmind\u2014neutral monism posits that the basic entities are all of a\nsingle, neutral kind. On many such views, there are also non-basic\nentities (such as minds and matter) grounded in the basic ones. But on\nothers, \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d are merely\nconvenient groupings of the basic entities and there are no non-basic\nones.\n\nThe \u201cimmense simplification\u201d neutral monism affords is\nwhat most attracted Russell to neutral monism (Russell 1959: 252). For\nMach and James, it also promises to free us from any commitment to the\nexistence of extra-empirical kinds of entities:\n\nnothing is important except what can be observed or is a datum for us,\nand everything hypothetical, metaphysical and superfluous, is to be\neliminated. (Mach 1886: 27\u201328)\n\n\nFirst on the list of \u201cmetaphysical entities\u201d (Mach 1905:\n13) that have to go are \u201cthe \u2018unfathomable\u2019 thing\nand the equally \u2018unexplorable\u2019 ego\u201d (Mach 1905: 8).\nAnd James concurs: \u201cConsciousness as it is ordinarily understood\ndoes not exist, any more than does Matter\u201d (James 1905: 63).\n3.2 The Mind-Body Problem\n\nMach, James, and Russell agree that neutral monism solves the\nmind-body problem. Russell\u2019s account of experience (of\nperceptual consciousness) may serve as an illustration of the point.\nRussell frequently emphasized the miracle or mystery involved in\ntraditional dualist accounts of perception (1927b: 147, 154; 1927a:\n275, 400). At the end of a purely physical chain of causes there\nmysteriously arises something of a completely different nature: an\nexperience (a sensation of red, say). This raises difficult questions\nabout how exactly these two seemingly different aspects of\nreality\u2014matter and mind\u2014are related to one another and how\nthey could be causes and/or effects of each other.\n\nMaterialism holds that mind is wholly grounded in basic material\nentities or features of reality and thus that mind-body causal\nrelations are ultimately a matter of physical causal relations. But\nthere are longstanding worries about whether properties of mental\nphenomena such as qualitativity, intentionality, and/or subjectivity\ncan be wholly grounded in material entities or properties. Idealism,\nin contrast, holds that matter is wholly grounded in basic mental\nentities or features of reality and that mind-body causation is\nultimately a matter of mental causal relations. But critics question\nwhether material phenomena can be adequately accounted for wholly in\nterms of mental phenomena.\n\nNeutral monism can be an attractive alternative for those who see the\nchallenges faced by these traditional positions as\n insurmountable.[14]\n In some cases, such interest in neutral monism is, perhaps, best seen\nas part of the general movement to explore all possible options in the\nmetaphysics of mind. As Jerry Fodor puts it, \u201cthe form of a\nphilosophical theory, often enough, is: Let\u2019s try looking\nover here\u201d (Fodor 1981: 31). But others see neutral monism\nas having resources the traditional positions lack and perhaps can\nmake use of themselves.\n\nNeutral monism addresses the mind-body problem by asserting that mind\nand matter are not as different as they might first appear. On the\nboth view, this is because the basic neutral entities are\nintrinsically both mental and material. But it is difficult to see how\nsuch a view avoids collapsing into a form of panpsychism, dual-aspect\ntheory, idealism, or materialism. On the neither view, the apparent\n\u201cgap\u201d between mind and matter is narrowed by the fact that\nboth are grounded in, or merely convenient groupings of, the same\nbasic entities which are themselves intrinsically neither mental nor\nmaterial. Accordingly, mind-body causal relations are ultimately just\na matter of causal relations among different groups of the basic\nneutral\n entities.[15]\n\nOne of the chief attractions of neutral monism is its promise for\nintegrating qualitative entities or properties into the natural world\nwithout positing experientiality among its most basic constituents. In\ndoing so, it has the potential to vindicate both naturalists who hold\nthat mental phenomena such as consciousness arise only in the context\nof complex systems of elements and those who see no hope of grounding\nthe qualitative aspects of consciousness wholly in non-qualitative\nmaterial entities or properties. There is, of course, an open question\nabout whether neutral monism can deliver on such promise.\n\nMany philosophers of mind who are in some ways sympathetic to neutral\nmonism also find Russell\u2019s views that physical theories\nabstractly describe the structure of physical reality while leaving us\nignorant about its intrinsic nature especially attractive. In fact,\nthis aspect of Russell\u2019s neutral monism is the primary\ninspiration for the assortment of \u201cRussellian monist\u201d\nviews that have been hotly debated in recent years (see 5.4\nbelow).\n3.3 Perceptual Evidence for Physics\n\nThe Analysis of Matter (Russell 1927a) is widely regarded as\nthe most important text of the neutral monist literature. Chapter one\nof this book, entitled \u201cThe Nature of the Problem\u201d, states\nit as follows:\n\nthe world of physics is, prima facie, so different from the\nworld of perception that it is difficult to see how the one can afford\nevidence for the other; moreover, physics and physiology themselves\nseem to give grounds for supposing that perception cannot give very\naccurate information as to the external world, and thus weaken the\nprops upon which they are built\u2026We must therefore find an\ninterpretation of physics which gives a due place to perceptions; if\nnot, we have no right to appeal to the empirical evidence. (Russell\n1927a: 6\u20137; see also Russell 1948: Part III, Ch. IV)\n\n\nThe previous remarks addressed to the mind-body problem in general,\nand to the problem of perceptual experience in particular, contain the\ncore of the solution Russell proposes. By \u201cbridging the gulf\nbetween physics (as commonly interpreted) and perception\u201d\n(Russell 1927a: 7), neutral monism promises to solve this\nproblem\u2014a problem that Russell took to be difficult and largely\nunnoticed (see Russell 1948: 175\u2013176).\n3.4 Knowledge of the External World\n\nMach and James understand neutral monism as an especially radical form\nof achieving perceptual contact with the world. It might be understood\nas a limiting case of na\u00efve realism\u2014a case in which the\nrelation between the subject and its perceptual object becomes the\nidentity relation. In perception \u201csubject and object\nmerge\u201d (James 1905: 57). A single reality\u2014a red patch,\nsay, when we see a tomato\u2014is a constituent of two groups of\nneutral entities: the group that is the perceiver, and the group that\nis the tomato. The mind and its object become one. In James\u2019s\nwords:\n\nA given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of\nassociates, play[s] the part of the knower, or a state of mind, or\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d; while in a different context the same\nundivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing known, of an\nobjective \u201ccontent\u201d. In a word, in one group it figures as\na thought, in another group as a thing. (James 1904b: 9\u201310)\n\n\nSome have seen this epistemic achievement as the most important reward\nof neutral monism.\n\nBut Russell dissented. There are well known problems surrounding\naccounts of perception that conceive it as a form of direct contact\nwith the world. Among them are the problems arising from the fact that\nan object can present different and incompatible appearances to\ndifferent observers, or even the same observer in different\ncircumstances. Some neutral monists concluded that \u201cnature is a\nseething chaos of contradiction\u201d (Holt 1914: 276). But Russell\nchose to abandon the view that in perception \u201csubject and object\nmerge\u201d. Instead he locates the red patch you see when looking at\na tomato in your brain, and distinguishes it from the tomato (from the\ngroup of events that constitute the tomato). That is why he can assert\nthat what is happening in his brain is \u201cexactly what na\u00efve\nrealism thinks it knows about what is happening in the outside\nworld\u201d (Russell 1927b: 138). This solves the problem of\ndifferent and incompatible appearances: compatibility is restored by\nmoving the conflicting features away from the single physical object\nand into the brains of the percipients. But in making this move\nRussell abandons the na\u00efve realism of Mach and James and puts a\nversion of representative realism in its place. The problem of our\nknowledge of the external world is thereby reintroduced in full\n force.[16]\n3.5 Unity of Science\n\nMach operates on the assumption that all sciences form a whole (see\nMach 1886: 30). The great virtue of neutral monism is that it affords\na unified perspective from which scientific inquiry can be\nundertaken:\n\nwhat I aimed at was merely to attain a safe and clear philosophical\nstandpoint, whence practicable paths, shrouded in no metaphysical\nclouds, might be seen leading not only into the field of physics but\nalso into that of psycho-physiology. (Mach 1886: 47)\n\n\nThe idea of neutral monism as a bridge between different sciences is\nalso present in Russell. He presents neutral monism as\n\nan attempt to harmonize two different tendencies, one in psychology,\nthe other in physics\u2026[viz.]\u2026the materialistic tendency\nof psychology and the anti-materialistic tendency of physics. (Russell\n1921: 5\u20136)\n\n4. Objections to Neutral Monism\n4.1 Reduction and the Threat of Elimination\n\nEvery version of reductionism must deal with the question of the\nontological status of the entities it reduces: are they retained or\neliminated? Both of these components are typically present in\ntraditional neutral\n monism.[17]\n Mach, for instance, alternates between claims such as that \u201cthe\nsupposed unities \u2018body\u2019 and \u2018ego\u2019 are only\nmakeshifts, designed for provisional survey and for certain practical\nends\u201d and claims that they are composites constituted by\n\u201ca more strongly coherent group of elements [that is] less\nstrongly connected with other groups of this kind\u201d (Mach 1886:\n20\u201321). Similarly, alongside Russell\u2019s many logical\nconstructions of various mental phenomena are remarks such as\nthis:\n\nThere are a number of words which I think should disappear from the\npsychological vocabulary: among these I should include\nknowledge, memory, perception, and\nsensation. (Russell 1996: 295)\n\n\nWhat is clear is that neutral monism dispenses with mind as\ntraditionally conceived by dualists and idealists and matter\nas traditionally conceived by dualists and materialists.\nThere is no need to suppose that there are \u201csolid persistent\nobjects moving through space\u201d or states with an inbuilt and\nprimitive \u201creference to objects\u201d (Russell 1921: 124, 36).\nBut, on the other hand, it provides constructions of neutral entities\nthat are designed to play the roles of the entities they displace. The\nsuccess of this strategy will have to be assessed on a case by case\nbasis. There are relatively few objections to neutral monism that turn\non the details of proposed constructions or reductions. (But see C.D.\nBroad\u2019s critique of Russell, 1925: 577\u2013584). The most\nchallenging criticisms of neutral monism do not engage with technical\ndetails, but aim squarely at the central idea of the\ndoctrine\u2014the idea of neutrality.\n4.2 The Mentalism Suspicion\n\nThe most frequent type of objection to the traditional versions of\nneutral monism is that they are forms of mentalistic monism: Berkleyan\nidealism, panpsychism, or phenomenalism. The core argument is simple:\nsensations (Mach), pure experience (James) and sensations/percepts\n(Russell) are paradigms of non-neutral, mental entities. Hence there\nis nothing neutral about these neutral monisms. This type of\nobjection\u2014the \u201cmentalism suspicion\u201d\u2014has been\narticulated by a diverse group of philosophers, among them: (Lenin\n1909: 34; Hartshorne 1937: 221\u20132; Stace 1946; Ayer 1971; Feigl\n1958: 426, 1975: 26\u20137; Maxwell 1976: 354; Popper & Eccles\n1977: 199; Strawson 1994: 97; Chalmers 1996: 155; Tully 2003: 355,\n369).\n\nThe prima facie plausibility of this objection is beyond\ndoubt. But Mach, James, and Russell were acutely aware of the problem\nand took themselves to have responded in a satisfactory manner. They\nreject the view that a sensation or an experience consists of a\nsubject directing a mental act\u2014awareness, consciousness,\nacquaintance\u2014onto an object. Dispensing with the subject and the\nact, they are left with what used to be the object\u2014a red patch,\nsay. And they hold that there is nothing intrinsically mental about\nred patches. A red patch becomes a red-sensation simply by being\nappropriately related to other entities of the same kind. There is no\nquick way to adjudicate this dispute; a careful assessment of each\ncase is required. Still, a comparison of neutral monism with its\nclosest mentalist alternatives can be a useful first step.\n\nPanpsychism holds that every basic entity\u2014usually understood as\na physical entity\u2014is also a mental entity. The physical nature\n(if present) and the mental nature of the basic entities are\nfundamental, i.e., irreducible (to each other or to anything else). On\nthe face of it, panpsychism and neutral monism are strikingly\ndifferent. Neutral monism takes mental and physical phenomena to be\nderivative, panpsychism does not; neutral monism holds that basic\nreality is neutral, panpsychism does not. And neutral monism is\ncompatible with the view that most physical objects, and all their\nparts, are absolutely nonmental, whereas panpsychism is not. This is\nhow things look on the Neither View of neutrality. On the\nBoth View of neutrality, things are less clear. The most\nnatural reading of the Both View will, however, not yield\npanpsychism\u2014the view that every basic physical entity has a\nmind\u2014but a dual aspect view\u2014a view according to which\nevery basic entity has a physical and a mental aspect or side. In any\ncase, Mach, James, and Russell resisted panpsychist or dual-aspect\ninterpretations of their views, though there is evidence suggesting\nthat James adopted panpsychism sometime after 1904.\n\nPhenomenalism has been defended as a doctrine about language, about\nfacts, and about things. Taken in this last sense, it attempts to\n\u201creduce material objects to sensa, that is, to explain them as\nconsisting solely of sensa or as being primarily groups or patterns of\nthem\u201d (Hirst 2006: 271). We might substitute the terms\n\u201csense-data\u201d, \u201csensations\u201d,\n\u201cpercepts\u201d, \u201cexperiences\u201d, etc. for\nHirst\u2019s term \u201csensa\u201d. As noted above, the\ntraditional neutral monists supposedly purged such terms of their\nusual intrinsically mental dimension. Moreover, neutral monism is not\nlimited to those entities that are sensations, perceptions, and so\non\u2014this is particularly clear in the case of Mach and Russell.\nThe existence of vast majority of neutral entities is inferred from\nthe minute set of elements that, due to their causal-functional roles,\nhappen to be sensations and perceptions. These inferred elements are\noutside of all minds. These are the strong anti-phenomenalist (and\nanti-idealist) positions. How successfully the various neutral monists\ndefend these claims is, of course, a difficult further question.\n4.3 The Materialism Suspicion\n\nIn the past neutral monism has often been interpreted as a form of\nmentalism. But a number of contemporary philosophers argue that it is\nbest understood as a form of physicalism.\n\nWe have noted how Landini\u2019s interpretation of the notion of\nneutrality (according to (3)\u2014the Possible Constituent\nView) allows him to argue that neutral monism is compatible with\nphysicalism. As he sees it, Russell is committed to such a version of\n(four-dimensionalist) physicalist neutral monism. Accordingly, Russell\nis engaged in the project of \u201cconstructing both [minds and\nmatter] out of orderings of physical events that are their\nstages\u201d (Landini 2011: 280). After a detailed discussion,\nLandini reaches the conclusion that Russell\u2019s basic transient\nparticulars (or events) \u201care without intrinsic phenomenal\ncharacter\u201d (Landini 2011: 297). This makes it possible to regard\nthem as physical entities in good standing. Their neutrality consists\nin the fact that they are the building blocks of both mental and\nphysical continuants (see Landini 2011: 292).\n\nSimilarly, Erik Banks (see section 5.6 below) presents his so-called\n\u201crealistic empiricism\u201d as a direct descendant of\ntraditional neutral monism (Banks 2014, viii). But he also holds that\nhis neutral monism is \u201ca kind of physicalism\u201d (Banks 2014:\n7, 142). Banks takes himself to follow Russell embracing an ontology\nof events as manifestations of underlying powers or\nenergies\u2014such as electromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear\nforces (Banks 149), as well as neural energies (Banks 2014: 142). But\nevent particulars such as these, Banks insists, \u201care so\nphysicalistic in nature that there does not seem to be any reason to\nassume that these natural qualities in physics have anything at all in\ncommon with our sensations, which are qualities of a very different\norder\u2026 [involving] events in the human nervous system at a very\ndifferent scale of complexity and size\u201d (Banks 2014: 156).\n\nAfter a careful survey of the development of Russell\u2019s neutral\nmonism, Donovan Wishon observes that Russell\u2019s post-1940 version\nof neutral monism \u201chas a greater affinity to Russellian\nPhysicalism than any genuinely neutral monism\u201d (Wishon\n2015: 114\u20135). Among other things, Wishon draws our attention to\nRussell\u2019s report that \u201cI find myself in ontology\nincreasingly materialistic\u201d (Russell 1946: 700). He also points\nto Russell\u2019s remarks that \u201cI should regard all events as\nphysical\u201d and that \u201cthe distinction between what is mental\nand what is physical does not lie in any intrinsic character of\neither, but in the way in which we acquire knowledge of them\u201d\n(Russell 1958: 12). Hence, Wishon concludes, \u201cmental events will\nturn out to be a subclass of the physical events that make up\nreality\u201d\u2014only their special epistemic accessibility\ndistinguishes them from the other physical events (2015: 112). But he\ndoes not quite answer whether Russell, in this late period, took all\nevents to be physical due to their intrinsic natures or merely due to\ntheir relations to other events.\n\nThese attempts to combine neutral monism with physicalism, or to\nreinterpret neutral monism along physicalist lines pose a serious\nchallenge to neutral monism as usually understood. They deny the\ncentral claim that the fundamental building blocks of the world are\nneutral in the sense of being both nonmental and\n nonphysical.[18]\n But no less noteworthy is the degree to which these versions of\nphysicalism depart from more standard forms of physicalism. In\nparticular, they agree with neutral monism that physical theories do\nnot fully capture the nature of the world they describe. This suggests\nthat the difference between neutral monism and this sort of\nphysicalism may not be so deep after all (see Chalmers 2015).\n4.4 The Problem of Experience\n\nEven if materialist suspicions about it are misplaced, some critics\nhold that neutral monism shares a common failing with materialism:\nnamely, that it cannot accommodate experience. The argument is driven\nby two deep metaphysical convictions. First, experience cannot be\nreduced to or constructed from the non-experiential; second, radical\nemergence is unintelligible. Assuming that the neutral must be\nnon-experiential, it follows that the neutral monist world has no room\nfor experience. Galen Strawson has wielded this argument against all\nforms of traditional materialism, and occasionally also against\nneutral monism (Strawson 1994, 2016, 2020).\n\nDavid Chalmers has raised a related worry about neutral monism,\nespecially in its panqualityist forms (see section 5.5 below): He\nargues that there is no path that leads from the qualities we\nexperience (but which are not experiential themselves) to the\nexperience of those qualities. Having an experience is a matter of\nhaving phenomenal qualities. Phenomenal qualities involve awareness of\nqualities. But \u201cno instantiations of qualities ever necessitate\nawareness of qualities\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273). This\n\u201cquality/awareness gap\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273) shows that no\nstructure of qualities can add up to\n experience.[19]\n\nThe traditional neutral monists would all agree that the mere\ninstantiation of qualities (which are intrinsically neutral) does not\nnecessitate any awareness of qualities. After all, such awareness\nresults only when a number of such qualities are appropriately related\nto each other. However, they depart from Chalmers in holding that\nsuitable relations among qualities are not only necessary for\nawareness, they are also sufficient for it. That is, for a subject\n(understood as an organized bundle of neutral events) to be aware of,\nsay, a red patch, just is for the red patch to bear the right kinds of\ncomplex causal-functional relations to other neutral events in an\norganized system of which it is a member (i.e. the bundle-self). Thus,\nthe traditional neutral monists would reject the view that no\nstructure of qualities can add up to experience.\n\nWhether such a reply is satisfactory is a matter of ongoing debate.\nYet to the extent that this proposal succeeds, it does raise a further\nquestion suggested by Strawson\u2019s argument above: is experience,\nthus understood in a neutral monist setting, a feature that is\nemergent in an objectionable way?\n4.5 The Problem of Emergence\n\nThe basic idea of emergence has to do with the fact that complex\nsystems may display interesting novel properties\u2014properties not\npossessed by their parts. This idea has been regimented in various\nways. Following Chalmers, we can distinguish between\n\u201cweak\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d emergence. Weakly emergent\nphenomena are merely unexpected, given our knowledge of the domain\nfrom which they arise. Strongly emergent phenomena are not just\nunexpected; they cannot (not even in principle) be deduced from the\ndomain from which they arise (see Chalmers 2006: 244). There are\nongoing debates, however, about whether epistemic and/or logical\nnotions such as deducibility are reliable guides to the nature of\nreality. Such issues can be set aside by instead using the notion of\n\u201cradical\u201d emergence for cases in which complex systems\ndisplay novel features that are not wholly grounded in the nature,\nfeatures, or relations of their parts (Strawson 2006). Weak emergence\nwill, no doubt, be a wide-spread phenomenon in the neutral monist\nworld. It poses no problem. In contrast, neutral monism appears to\nrule out radical emergence. Things are less clear in the case of\nstrong emergence. Russell\u2019s method of logical construction is\nincompatible with strong emergence, but it is an open question whether\nother neutral monist accounts are.\n\nLandini adopts the contrary view that radical emergence plays a\ncrucial role in Russell\u2019s neutral monism. If the fundamental\ntransient physical particulars (or events) have no phenomenal\ncharacters (or qualia), such qualities must be understood as radically\nemergent features within the framework of Russell\u2019s\n account.[20]\n\nQualia never occur in transient particulars. In Russell\u2019s view,\nqualia emerge from the series of brain states\u2026colors, pitches,\nsmells, tastes and textures are emergent properties of series of brain\nstates\u2026. (Landini 2011: 302\u2013305)\n\n\nBut Russell\u2019s remarks about emergence (Russell 1927b:\n293\u201396) allow different reading. When called upon to present\nexamples of events, Russell gives the following list:\n\nseeing a flash of lightning\u2026hearing a tyre burst, or smelling a\nrotten egg, or feeling the coldness of a frog\u2026particular colors\nand sounds and so on are events. (Russell 1927b: 287\u201388)\n\n\nAll of these events are percepts\u2014the only kinds of events we can\nknow without inference. And, pace Landini, all of these events do have\nqualitative characters. When Russell speaks of emergence, he has in\nmind the relationship between physics\u2019 abstract mathematical\ndescriptions of events and their intrinsic qualitative characters. And\nhe maintains that latter are (strongly) emergent with respect to the\nformer because there is no inferential path leading from abstract\nmathematical descriptions of an event to its intrinsic qualitative\nfeatures. For such abstract and mathematical considerations\n\ncannot conceivably\u2026prove that there are visual events, or\nauditory events, or events of any of the kind that we know by\nperception. (Russell 1927b: 295)\n\n\nBut it is debatable whether such qualities radically emerge from\nanything. In any case, this is not how the neutral monist (who follows\nRussell\u2019s lead) starts out. Our percepts are our initial data,\nand they are qualitative through and through. We simply do not have to\ndeduce the existence of quality from other known facts, such as those\ninvolving complex brain states. Qualities are there, in the form of\nour percepts, at the very foundation of Russell\u2019s theory. Such\nother events as we may believe in, whose intrinsic qualities we do not\nknow, are all inferred from this qualitative bedrock. Even so, the\nneutral monist insists, it doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that\nsomething is irreducibly qualitative that it is intrinsically\nmental\u2014or mental at all.\n4.6 The Dualism Suspicion\n\nAnother common objection to neutral monism is that it constitutes a\nform of property dualism or dual aspect theory. The argument is\nstraightforward: On the neutral monist picture, physics describes\ncertain relations\u2014namely, the physical ones\u2014among the\nbasic entities without capturing their intrinsic qualities, or those\nof the complexes of which they are parts. These latter features are\nrevealed to us only in the case of our sensations, percepts, and other\nmental episodes. This suggests that the basic entities exhibit two\nfundamentally different kinds of aspects or properties: extrinsic\nphysical relations and intrinsic mental qualities. But there\u2019s\nnothing properly neutral about either kind of feature, and\nneither is reducible to the other. At best, they are two radically\ndifferent aspects of an underlying reality which, in itself, is\nneither mental nor physical.\n\nThe theory of dual or double aspects is usually traced back to Spinoza\n(1677). The fundamental idea uniting the family of views under this\nlabel is that there is an underlying reality that we can grasp as\nmental or as physical, depending on the point of view from which we\napprehend it. Each one of us can know their own brain under each of\nthese aspects\u2014via introspection and (scientific) observation.\nBut the claim of the theory is quite general: everything there is is\nto be understood as consisting of an underlying reality that has these\ntwo aspects.\n\nNeutral monism and the dual-aspect theory share a central claim: there\nis an underlying reality that is neither mental nor physical. But that\nis where the agreement stops. Neutral monism has no room for the\ncentral feature of the dual-aspect theory: the mental and physical\naspects, sides, or properties that characterize the underlying\nentities of dual-aspect theory. The neutral monist accepts the\nmental/physical distinction. But it resides at the level or groups of\nneutral entities. Grouped one way, the neutral entities constituting\nyour brain are thoughts and feelings; grouped another way, they are\natoms and neurons and lobes. Whether a given group of interrelated\nneutral entities counts as mental or physical depends on the\ncausal-functional role this group occupies. But the entities\nthemselves are free of intrinsically mental or physical\naspects/sides/properties. Therein consists their neutrality.\n\nBut if neutrality is understood according to the Both View,\nthe case for identifying neutral monism with dual-aspect theory is\nstrengthened. Much will turn on how the details of the Both\nView are articulated. It must not, for example, be understood as\nproposing the identification of mental and physical properties. For\nthe dual-aspect theory insists that the two aspects are fundamental\nand irreducible to each other. Another question concerns the\nrelationship of the aspects and properties. If aspects are understood\nas properties, dual-aspect theory may simply collapse into property\ndualism (see, e.g., Van Gulick 2014). Dual-aspect theorists have\npushed back by insisting that aspects are not properties (see Skrbina\n2014: 228\u201329). But this may, in turn, block the project of\nreconciling the dual-aspect theory with neutral monism. For the\nneutrality, on the Both as well as on the Neither\nView, is understood in terms of mental and physical\nproperties.\n\nThere is a lively debate concerning the relationship between neutral\nmonism, property dualism, and dual-aspect theory (see, e.g., Velmans\n2008; Skrbina 2014). The decision about these theories\u2014whether\nthey are identical, distinct but compatible, or incompatible\nrivals\u2014is still out.\n4.7 Error\n\nThe neutral monism of Mach and James is committed to a naively\nrealistic account of perception according to which our perceptual\nexperiences and the aspects of the world perceived are one and the\nsame. Nonveridical experiences\u2014illusions, hallucinations,\ndreams, etc.\u2014are difficult to accommodate within such a picture.\nFor in cases of nonveridical experience\u2014e.g. when a drunkard\n\u201csees\u201d a pink rat\u2014we are inclined to say that the\nworld does not contain the relevant entities.\n\nBut traditional neutral monism provides an ontology rich enough to\naddress this problem. The pink patch experienced by the drunkard\nexists: it is a portion of pure experience (James), or an element\n(Mach). This much na\u00efve realism is true, even in the cases of\nnonveridical experience. But the pink rat that the drunkard\ntakes himself to see does not exist\u2014the pink patch he sees is\nnot a member of a group of neutral elements constituting a material\nobject such as a rat. There is nothing wrong with the drunkard\u2019s\nvisual experience; what is mistaken is his assumption about how what\nhe sees is connected with the rest of the world. Russell (though not a\nna\u00efve realist himself) states this point most succinctly:\n\u201cThere are in fact no illusions of the senses, but only mistakes\nin interpreting sensational data as signs of things other than\nthemselves\u201d (Russell 1948: 149\u201350). Mach puts the point as\nfollows:\n\nWhen we consider elements like red, green, hot, cold and the rest,\nwhich are physical and mental in virtue of their dependence on both\nexternal and internal circumstances, and are in both respects\nimmediately given and identical, the question as to illusion and\nreality loses its sense. Here we are simultaneously confronted by the\nelements of the real world and of the ego. The only possible further\nquestion of interest concerns their functional\ninterdependence\u2026. (Mach 1905: 7\u20138)\n\n5. New Directions for Neutral Monism\n\nNeutral monism is not simply a historical curiosity. It has evolved\ninto a number of new forms and remains an important part of ongoing\ndiscussions about the mind-body problem.\n5.1 Information as Ultimate Reality\n\nAnticipating the current revival in interest in neutral monism by a\nfew decades, Kenneth Sayre (1929\u2013) published his main ideas on\nneutral monism in the 1970s. Unlike the big three, Sayre\nfinds the neutral base of his system not in experience, but in the\nform of pure information, where information is understood in the\nstrict information theoretical sense. His proposal must not be\nmistaken for the uncontroversial claim that that mental and physical\nprocesses can be described in information theoretic terms.\nSayre puts forward an ontological claim about the ultimate nature of\nreality\u2014that ultimate reality consists of informational\nstates:\n\nIf the project\u2026is successful, it will have been shown not only\nthat the concept of information provides a primitive for the analysis\nof both the physical and the mental, but also that states of\ninformation\u2026existed previously to states of mind. Since\ninformation in this sense is prior to mentality, but also implicated\nin all mental states, it follows that information is prior also in the\nontological sense\u2026Success of the present project thus will show\nthat an ontology of informational states is adequate for an\nexplanation of the phenomena of mind, as distinct from an ontology of\nphysical events. [And Sayre adds:] It is a reasonable conjecture that\nan ontology of information is similarly basic to the physical\nsciences\u2026. (Sayre 1976: 16)\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges faced by the traditional versions of\nneutral monism is to show how basic entities that are derived from\nexperience can be neutral, rather than mental. By choosing an ontology\nof informational states as his \u201cneutral stuff\u201d, Sayre\nelegantly bypasses this problem. But while the neutrality of\ninformational states may be taken for granted, the question of the\nrelationship of this seemingly abstract \u201cstuff\u201d to\nconcrete world of physical and mental entities becomes all the more\n pressing.[21]\n\nSayre\u2019s main work on neutral monism is his 1976. In recent\ndecades, David Chalmers has similarly explored the idea of an\ninformational ontology (see Chalmers 1996). And the related ideas that\nultimate reality is purely structural (Ladyman and Ross 2007; Floridi\n2008, 2009), is a computational process (Fredkin 2003; Lloyd 2006), or\nis purely mathematical (Tegmark 2014) are the subject of a lively\ndiscussion.\n5.2 Mind & Matter: A Merely Conceptual Distinction\n\nFor want of a better label, John Heil presents his view on the\nmind-body relation as a form of neutral monism. He resists being\nlabeled a materialist\n\nbecause it carries with it the implication that there is an\nasymmetry in the identification of mental qualities with\nmaterial qualities: the mental is supplanted by the material. (Heil\n2013: 242)\n\n\nNor does he see himself as an idealist. And he has systematic and deep\nreasons for rejecting the property dualism that characterizes the\nvarious versions of nonreductive materialism. The neutral monism that\nhe accepts is characterized as follows:\n\n\nNeutral monism includes the denial that there is a\nmental\u2013material chasm to be bridged. The mental\u2013material\ndistinction is, as Spinoza and Donald Davidson contend, a distinction\nof conception only, not a real distinction, not a distinction\nin reality. (Heil 2013: 242)\n\n\nAn example will help to illustrate the gist of this view. Take the\nwell-worn claim that pain is c-fiber\n stimulation.[22]\n According to Heil, this says that the predicate \u201cc-fiber\nstimulation\u201d and the predicate \u201cpain\u201d apply to the\nsame things: all things that are truly described as being c-fiber\nstimulations are also truly described as pains. But\u2014and this is\na crucial claim that cannot be developed here\u2014this does\nnot mean that there is a property of being a c-fiber\nstimulation and a property of being a pain, and that these two\nproperties stand in some interesting relationship, such as identity,\nreduction, realization, etc. What this does mean is that there is a\ncomplex object that makes both of these claims true. The nature of the\nparts of this object, as well as their intricate relationships to one\nanother, is the reality that is correctly described as a c-fiber\nstimulation and as a pain.\n\nThis part of Heil\u2019s account appears to be consistent with the\nspirit of traditional neutral monism. One is reminded of\nRussell\u2019s pithy description of his project: \u201cWhat I wish\nto do in this essay is to restate the relations of mind and brain in\nterms not implying the existence of either\u201d (Russell 1956a:\n145). This can easily be read as a denial of the existence of a chasm\nbetween mental and physical properties. And Heil\u2019s complex\nobjects that serve as the truth-makers for mental and physical\ndescriptions may be seen as analogous to Russell\u2019s groups\n(logical constructions) of events that can properly be described in\nphysical and mental terms.\n\nBut there is an additional part to the neutral monist\npicture\u2014one that (arguably) all of the mainline neutral monists\nagree on\u2014that Heil rejects. When he tells the \u201cdeep\nstory\u201d (Heil\u2019s term) about the nature of the complex\nobjects (the truth-makers for claims about c-fibers and pains etc.),\nhe turns to fundamental physics:\n\nI take it to be an empirical question\u2014a question for science,\nfor fundamental physics\u2014what the substances are and what they\nare like, how they are. (Heil 2013: 201\u20132)\n\n\nSo the basic constituents of the world\u2014the substances and the\nproperties\u2014that Heil describes are physical. Here the\nneutral monist (who is committed to the Neither View of\nneutrality) parts company with Heil. The deep story of the neutral\nmonist has it that the fundamental entities\u2014be they events, bits\nof information, substances, properties, etc.\u2014are not physical\n(and not mental, of course). That is to say, they are not the sort of\nthing that fundamental physics (or psychology) reveals.\n5.3 Complex Basic Entities\n\nIn his book Mind and Cosmos (2012) Thomas Nagel asserts that\n\u201cthe weight of the evidence favors some form of neutral monism\nover the traditional alternatives of materialism, idealism, and\ndualism\u201d (2012: 5). Neutral monism is understood as a view that\n\u201caccounts for the relation between mind and brain in terms of\nsomething more basic about the natural order\u201d (2012: 56). This\nyields a picture of a \u201cgeneral monism according to which the\nconstituents of the universe have properties that explain not only its\nphysical but its mental character\u201d (2012: 56). Borrowing a\nconcept from Tom Sorrell (whom Nagel cites approvingly), we can say\nthat these basic constituents of the universe are \u201ctransphysical\nand transmental\u201d (2012: 57). All that has been said up to this\npoint supports the view that Nagel endorses neutral monism.\n\nBut what Nagel says next seems to contradict this simple picture. He\nwrites:\n\nEverything, living or not, is constituted from elements having a\nnature that is both physical and nonphysical\u2014that is, capable of\ncombining into mental wholes. So this reductive account can also be\ndescribed as a form of panpsychism: all the elements of the physical\nworld are also mental. (Nagel 2012: 57)\n\n\nNote that the description of the basic constituents has changed from\n\u201ctransphysical and transmental\u201d to \u201cphysical and\nmental\u201d\u2014from the Neither View to the Both\nView. And Nagel is very much aware that these are not the same\nthing. In an earlier paper in which he considers neutral monism, he\nwrites:\n\nthis view would imply that the fundamental constituents of the world,\nout of which everything is composed, are neither physical nor mental\nbut something more basic. This position is not equivalent to\npanpsychism. Panpsychism is, in effect, dualism all the way down. This\nis monism all the way down. (Nagel 2002: 231)\n\n\nIs there a way to overcome this apparent tension and to see these two\nviews as parts of a coherent whole? In a personal communication Prof.\nNagel offered the following explanation:\n\nthe fundamental elements would be neither merely physical nor merely\nmental, but something that was necessarily both physical and mental,\n(or protomental); but since this necessary connection can\u2019t hold\ndirectly between the physical and the mental as we conceive them, it\nwould require that the real character of these fundamental\nconstituents be something more basic that accounts for their being\nboth physical and (proto)mental.\n\n\nThe resulting picture is this. Described at the most fundamental\nlevel, the constituents of the world have properties that are neither\nmental nor physical. These neutral properties of every fundamental\nentity give rise to physical and mental (or protomental) properties.\nThus each fundamental constituent is complex: it has mental (or\nprotomental) properties, it has physical properties, and it has these\ntwo sets of properties as a necessary consequence of its having a\nthird set of properties\u2014the neutral properties.\n\nThe foundational role played by the neutral properties (in the\nNeither Sense) can be taken to suggest that the view is a\nform of neutral monism. This interpretation can be further supported\nby arguing that the neutral properties ground the other properties of\nthe basic entities, and that grounded properties make for \u201cno\naddition to being\u201d. However, it departs from traditional neutral\nmonism in holding that the basic constituents have intrinsic\nphysical and mental (or protomental) properties in addition to the\nneutral\n ones.[23]\n Thus, it is perhaps best characterized as a form of the dual-aspect\ntheory or property dualism. But others might call it a panpsychism\nsince each fundamental entity has mental (or protomental)\nfeatures.\n5.4 Russellian Monism, Panprotopsychism, and Panqualityism\n\nIn the search for a solution to the mind-body problem one may be\ncaptivated by the thought that we know less about matter than we are\ncommonly led to believe. All we do (or can) know are the dispositional\nproperties of\n matter.[24]\n When combined with the insight that dispositions need categorical\ngrounds, one discovers that one\u2019s conception of matter is\nradically incomplete. In addition to all the dispositional properties\nthat physics treats of, matter must have intrinsic categorical\nproperties. Since the nature of these intrinsic properties is unknown,\nthe following bold thought suggests itself. Perhaps these properties\nplay a dual role: in addition to grounding to dispositional properties\nof matter, they also serve as the grounds of our conscious experience.\nThese are the kinds of considerations that may lead one to Russellian\nmonism, the view that\n\nmatter has intrinsic properties that both constitute consciousness and\nserve as categorical bases for the dispositional properties described\nin physics. (Alter and Nagasawa 2015: 1)\n\n\nThe basic constituents of the world of Russellian monism are the\nfundamental entities of physics. But their most fundamental properties\nare not ones fully captured by physical descriptions, but rather the\nintrinsic properties in virtue of which they fit such descriptions.\nAnd these very same intrinsic properties, when arranged appropriately,\ngive rise to conscious experience.\n\nThere are many versions of Russellian Monism. Differences are due, in\npart, to varying views about the relations between the intrinsic\nproperties, on the one side, and the mental and material properties,\non the other. But the central disagreement concerns the nature of the\nintrinsic properties. They have been held to be physical (Stoljar\n2001; Pereboom 2011, 2015; Montero 2015), mental (Bolender 2001;\nChalmers 2017; Schneider 2017), mental and physical (Strawson 2015,\n2016, 2020; Goff 2017), or neutral (Coleman 2014, 2017a). Accordingly,\nthere are physicalist, idealist, panpsychist, and neutral monist\nversions or Russellian monism. The precise nature of these\ndisagreements is difficult to pin down, given the number of different\nnotions of the mental and the material that are in play in this\ndiscussion (see 1.1 above).\n\nThe best-known version of Russellian neutral monism is\npanprotopsychism\u2014a view that David Chalmers has explored over\nmany years (Chalmers 1996, 2015). In the standard form of this theory\nthe postulated intrinsic properties are characterized as being neither\nexperiential (they are proto-psychic) nor physical (they lack\nthe structural/dispositional nature of physical properties). That\nmakes them neutral (in the Neither Sense). But this purely\nnegative characterization of the intrinsic properties has struck many\nas unsatisfying.\n\nA variant of this theory\u2014panqualityism\u2014addresses this\nproblem in a most satisfactory manner, while creating new problems of\nits own.\n\nIt takes redness, greenness, sweetness, roundness, etc.\u2014the\nprimitive sensory qualities given to us in experience, and considered\njust as such\u2014to be the intrinsic properties of the fundamental\nphysical entities (cf. Chalmers 2015: 272). One\u2019s being aware of\nredness\u2014i.e., the property of phenomenal redness\u2014is\nmental, but redness itself is not. Nor is (this kind of) redness a\nphysical, structural property. So panqualityism has secured a neutral\nbase with which we are intimately familiar. Chalmers conjectures\nthat\n\nversions of [panqualityism] were popular among the neutral monists of\nthe early twentieth century, including William James (1904b), Ernst\nMach (1886), and Bertrand Russell (1921). (Chalmers 2015: 271)\n\n\nBut panqualityism also has a growing number of contemporary defenders.\nSam Coleman, for instance, has developed panqualityism in a number of\ninteresting new directions and restored its place within ongoing\ndebates about the metaphysics of mind (Coleman 2014, 2017a, 2017b,\n2022).\n\nOf course, one may wonder how an electron\u2019s being red can ground\nits negative charge or share Wilfrid Sellars\u2019 (1963: 35) view\nthat it makes no sense to think that fundamental physical entities\nmight have primitive sensory qualities like redness. One may also\nshare Chalmers\u2019 worry that qualities, no matter how intricately\narranged, cannot ground the phenomenal properties of our experience\nfor \u201cno instantiations of qualities ever necessitate awareness\nof qualities\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273). Whether panqualityists can\noffer satisfactory replies to such objections is a matter of ongoing\ndebate.\n\nWhat the consideration of Russellian Monism shows is that (i) new\nversions of neutral monism are currently being developed that\nemphasize somewhat different considerations than those of traditional\nneutral monism; (ii) but even the most promising and well-developed\nversions of Russellian neutral monism face considerable\nchallenges.\n5.5 Realistic Empiricism: Powerful Qualities\n\nIn his book The Realistic Empiricism of Mach, James, and Russell.\nNeutral Monism Reconceived (2014), Erik Banks presents a critical\nsurvey of the big three of neutral monism, as well as his own\ndevelopment of the doctrine.\n\nThe neutral monist core of Banks\u2019s view amounts to this:\n\nindividual events are neutral, neither mental nor physical. Neutral\nevents make up \u201cphysical\u201d systems and extensions and\n\u201cmental\u201d sensations in minds through different functional\nrelations. (Banks 2014: 203)\n\n\nThis is very much in keeping with the traditional version of neutral\nmonism, especially Russell\u2019s event-based version. But Banks\nembeds this core idea into a larger metaphysical framework. The\nresulting theory is thoroughly original.\n\nIn a first step, Banks explains how this core idea fits into a larger\na posteriori physicalist picture. Physicalism, according to\nBanks, is best thought of as the view that mental supervenes on the\nphysical. Standard physicalism focuses on the question of how mental\nproperties and relations depend physical properties and relations. But\nBanks sides with the Russellian monist in holding that standard\nphysicalism does not specify the nature of the entities that exemplify\nthese properties and relations. So-called \u201cenhanced\nphysicalism\u201d goes beyond standard physicalism in specifying the\nnature of the entities that bear or instantiate the relevant\nproperties and relations:\n\nIn enhanced physicalism\u2026the instantiation of all physical\nproperties are individualized event particulars in causal-functional\nrelations to each other. (Banks 2014: 147)\n\n\nThis is how the neutral events slot into the enhanced physicalist\npicture that Banks favors.\n\nIn a second step, Banks provides us with an account of events. Events\nhave, and are individuated by, intrinsic characters or concrete\nqualities. None of those qualities are mental; but experience\nfamiliarizes us with some of them (see Banks 2014: 6). These qualities\nare the ways certain powers manifest themselves in events (see Banks\n2014: 6). Examples of such powers (or energies) include\nelectromagnetism, gravitation, and nuclear forces, and, most relevant\nin the present context, neural energy\u2014the internal energies in\nneurons (see Banks 2014,149, 203). Manifesting itself qualitatively at\nthe level of the single neuron, this energy may yield an electrical\ndischarge event; but manifesting itself at the level of a complex\nbrain event\u2014an event that is \u201csomehow\n\u2018composed\u2019 of neurons firing in some kind of\ncluster\u201d (Banks 2014: 147)\u2014this very same neural energy\nmay yield the event that is a sensation of blue. This closes the\napparent chasm between the experience of blue and the firing of a\nbunch of neurons:\n\nthe quality blue and the individual electrical discharges are just\ndifferent and mutually exclusive manifestations of the same natural\npowers which we mistakenly see as belonging to totally different\ncategories of event. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nThis is an attractive picture, but it is difficult to see it as a\nmonism of neutral events. Wherein does the neutrality of these\nevents\u2014an experience of blue and neural firing\nevents\u2014consist? Moreover, it is not obvious that events (whether\nneutral or not) play a fundamental ontological role. In their place we\nfind the powers/energies that give rise to events.\n\nBanks addresses this second problem head on: Powers are identical with\ntheir token manifestations, identical with the events that consist in\nthe individual qualities wherein these powers manifest themselves (see\nBanks 2014:\n 149).[25]\n There is no separate, more fundamental level of reality underlying\nthe events. The powers just are the events. The neural energy\nis identical with the event that is the electrical discharging of a\ngroup of neurons; this same neural energy is also identical with the\nevent that is a sensation of blue. But, and this is a crucial part of\nBanks\u2019s view, the discharge events are not identical with the\nblue sensation. Banks sees the question that this poses clearly:\n\nhow can it be the case that the powers are identical with each of\ntheir token manifestations and even identical qua powers across\ndifferent token manifestation events, but that different token\nmanifestation events are not identical to each other? (Banks 2014:\n149)\n\n\nThis is not an easy knot to unravel. Perhaps an appeal to the\ncontroversial notion of \u201crelative identity\u201d might help.\n\nAssuming that the fundamentality of events has been established, we\nstill face the question in which sense they qualify as neutral.\nConsider\n\nthe event of seeing a blue patch and the event of having all the\nconfigured neurons fire in the region of the brain\nresponsible for seeing the blue patch. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nTo the na\u00efve opinion that the first of these events is mental,\nwhile the second is physical, Banks replies as follows:\n\nThe phenomenon of sensation simply falls into place as a certain type\nof physical event among others in nature. The separate category of\nmental phenomena simply ceases to exist, except as a provisional way\nof talking. (Banks 2014: 164)\n\n\nThe monism expressed in this answer is beyond reasonable doubt; but\nthe neutrality is somewhat elusive.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe traditional versions of neutral monism of Mach, James, and Russell\nreflect the empiricist outlook of their authors. This leads them to\nturn to experience when searching for their neutral entities. And this\nleads many to see their doctrines as tainted by mentalism. Perhaps the\ntraditional neutral monists were wrong to forge this tight link\nbetween the neutral entities and experience. Or perhaps critics are\ntoo quick in dismissing their efforts to discover a neutral base in\nthis area. The rising interest in the history of analytic\nphilosophy\u2014especially the gradual rediscovery of Russell as a\nmetaphysician and epistemologist\u2014offers some hope for better\nunderstanding of traditional neutral monism.\n\nBut the fortunes of neutral monism are no longer exclusively tied to\nthe fate of traditional neutral monism. The neutral monist strand\nwithin the broader movement of Russellian monism is a promising new\ndevelopment. And some contemporary attempts to revive neutral monism\nare free of any ties to the traditional versions of the doctrine.\nThomas Nagel\u2019s recent defense of neutral monism comes to mind.\nAnd the idea to make abstract entities\u2014information, structure,\ncomputation, mathematical reality\u2014into the neutral basis of a\nmetaphysical system is being actively developed by philosophers and\nscientists alike.\n\nUntil quite recently it seemed that neutral monism (in its traditional\nform) was a brief and unimportant sideshow on the grand stage of\nmetaphysics. Notwithstanding the fact that the three main\nprotagonists\u2014Mach, James, and Russell\u2014were important\nfigures, whose ideas profoundly influenced many areas of contemporary\nthought, their speculations about neutral monism seemed to have\nvanished from the philosophical scene. But the current wave of\ninterest in the traditional versions of neutral monism, as well as the\nlively development of alternative versions of neutral monism, indicate\nthat neutral monism is, once more, becoming a live option in the\nongoing efforts to explore the metaphysics of\n mind.[26]\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ahmed, Mafizuddin, 1989, <em>Bertrand Russell\u2019s Neutral\nMonism</em>, New Delhi: Mittal Publications.", "Alter, Torin and Yujin Nagasawa (eds.), 2015, <em>Consciousness in\nthe Physical World: Perspectives on Russellian Monism</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Apostolova, Iva, 2004, \u201cFrom Acquaintance to Neutral Monism:\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Cognition 1910\u20131921\u201d, <em>The\nBertrand Russell Society Quarterly</em>, August (123).\n [<a href=\"https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/04august.apostolova.htm\" target=\"other\">Apostolova 2004 available online</a>]", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2022, \u201cDoes Neutral Monism Provide\nthe Best Framework for Relational Memory?\u201d, <em>Feminist\nPhilosophy of Mind</em>, Jennifer McWeeny and Keya Maitra (eds.), New\nYork: Oxford University Press, Chapter 18.", "Apostolova, Iva and Nils Frederick-Wagner, 2020, \u201cTwo Sides\nof the Same Coin?
