    "main_text": "Distribution According to Need || Proportionality Principle\n5.1 Proportionality Principle\n\n\nUnder conditions of abundance, it is perfectly clear what distribution\naccording to need entails: everyone should receive the resources that\nare required to fulfil all of their needs. The much more difficult\nquestion is to provide an interpretation of the principle under\nconditions of scarcity where needs cannot be met in full (for longer\ndiscussions, see Miller 1999, ch. 10 and Miller, forthcoming). We can\nthink of each person as having a need-based claim which is measured by\nthe size of the gap between what she now has, and what she would have\nto be given to meet her need in full. For example, if for a healthy\nlife a woman needs food that provides 2000 kilocalories per day, but\nthe amount of food now available to her only provides 1500, then her\nclaim is for additional food that provides 500 kilocalories. It might\nthen seem that to distribute according to need means to distribute in\nproportion to the size of claims: the person whose claim is 1000 kcal\nshould receive twice as much food as the person whose claim is\n500. This models distribution according to need on distribution\naccording to (comparative) desert, where a proportionality principle\nis generally thought to be the appropriate one to use. But in the case\nof needs, there are two objections to this solution.\n\n\nFirst, there is no general reason to think that people will be equally\neffective in converting need-satisfying resources into satisfied\nneeds. This will depend, for example, on the body\u2019s capacity to\nmetabolize food or medicine. So a distribution of resources that is\nproportionate to initial need claims won\u2019t necessarily bring\nabout a proportionate decrease in those claims. Second, even if\nconversion rates are the same, applying the proportionality principle\nwill still leave those with larger initial claims worse off. For\nexample, suppose we only have enough food to supply 600 kcal of energy\nto the two people in the previous paragraph. Using the proportionality\nprinciple, we award 400 kcal to the first person and 200 kcal to the\nsecond. But the outcome is that the first person is left with an\nunsatisfied claim for 600 kcal and the second for only 300\nkcal. Intuitively, this is not what it means to attend to their needs\nfairly.\n",
