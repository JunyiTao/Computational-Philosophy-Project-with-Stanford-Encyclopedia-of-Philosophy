    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n6. Influence \nWang is regarded, along with Lu Xiangshan, as one of the founders\nof the Lu\u2013Wang School of Neo\u2013Confucianism, or the School\nof Mind.  This is one of the two major wings of\nNeo\u2013Confucianism, along with the Cheng\u2013Zhu School (named\nafter Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi), or School of Pattern.  He has frequently\nbeen an inspiration for critics of the orthodox Cheng\u2013Zhu\nSchool, not just in China but also in Japan.  In Japan, his philosophy\nis referred to as \u014cy\u014dmeigaku, and its major\nadherents included Nakae T\u014dju (1608\u20131648) and Kumazawa\nBanzan (1619\u20131691).  Wang\u2019s thought was also an inspiration for\nsome of the leaders of the Meiji Restoration (1868), which began\nJapan\u2019s rapid \nmodernization.[11]\nIn China, Confucianism underwent a significant shift during the\nQing dynasty (1644\u20131911) with the development of the Evidential\nResearch movement.  Evidential Research emphasized carefully\ndocumented and tightly argued work on concrete issues of philology,\nhistory, and even mathematics and civil engineering.  Such scholars\ngenerally looked with disdain on \u201cthe Song\u2013Ming\nConfucians\u201d (including both Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming), whom they\naccused of producing \u201cempty words\u201d that could not be\n substantiated.[12] \n One of the few Evidential Research\nscholars with a serious interest in ethics was Dai Zhen\n(1724\u20131777). However, he too was critical of both the\nCheng\u2013Zhu and the Lu\u2013Wang schools.  The three major prongs\nof Dai\u2019s critique of Neo\u2013Confucians like Wang were that they (1)\nencouraged people to treat their subjective opinions as the\ndeliverances of some infallible moral sense, (2) projected\nBuddhist\u2013inspired concepts back onto the ancient Confucian\nclassics, and (3) ignored the ethical value of ordinary physical\ndesires. \nOne of the major trends in contemporary Chinese philosophy is\n\u201cNew Confucianism.\u201d New Confucianism is a movement to\nadapt Confucianism to modern thought, showing how it is consistent\nwith democracy and modern science.  New Confucianism is distinct from\nwhat we in the West call Neo\u2013Confucianism, but it adopts many\nNeo\u2013Confucian concepts, in particular the view that humans share\na trans\u2013personal nature which is constituted by the universal\nPattern.  Many New Confucians agree with Mou Zongsan (1909\u20131995)\nthat Wang had a deeper and more orthodox understanding of Confucianism\nthan did Zhu \nXi.[13] \nWang\u2019s philosophy is of considerable intrinsic interest, because of\nthe ingenuity of his arguments, the systematicity of his views, and\nthe precision of his textual exegesis.  Beyond that, Wang\u2019s work has\nthe potential to inform contemporary ethics. Although his particular\nmetaphysics may not be appealing, many of his ideas can be\nnaturalized.  It may be hard to believe that everything is unified by\na shared, underlying Pattern, but it does seem plausible that we are\ndeeply dependent upon one another and upon our natural environment for\nour survival and our identities.  I am a husband, a father, a teacher,\nand a researcher, but only because I have a wife, children, students,\nand colleagues.  In some sense, we do form \u201cone body\u201d with\nothers, and Wang provides provocative ideas about how we should\nrespond to this insight.  In addition, Wang\u2019s fundamental criticism of\nZhu Xi\u2019s approach, that it produces pedants who only study and talk\nabout ethics, rather than people who strive to actually be\nethical, has considerable contemporary relevance, particularly given\nthe empirical evidence that our current practices of ethical education\nhave little positive effect on ethical behavior (Schwitzgebel and Rust\n2014; and cf. Schwitzgebel 2013 (Other Internet Resources)).\n",
