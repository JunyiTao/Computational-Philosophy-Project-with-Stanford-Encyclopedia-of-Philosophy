    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy\n2. Models of Global Democracy\n\n\nThere are many different proposals for global democracy and,\ncorrespondingly, many different taxonomical divisions have been\ndeveloped. For instance, Scholte (2014) divides the literature into\n\u2018statist\u2019 and \u2018modern cosmopolitan\u2019 approaches.\nArchibugi et al. (2012, 7) suggest a tripartite (ideal-typical) break\nbetween federalist (world state), confederalist (intergovernmental\ndemocratic states), and polycentric (pluralist) prescriptions for\nglobal democracy. And Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca (2008, 117)\nidentifies three strands in the current literature to which she affixes\nthe nomenclature of a \u2018denial approach,\u2019 a \u2018wishful\nthinking approach,\u2019 and a \u2018compensatory approach.\u2019\nThis entry takes a different tack by presenting five different\n\u2018models\u2019 of global democracy. Models represent idealized\ntheoretical constructions designed to express the normative qualities\nof a democratic system as well as its constitutive institutions. Models\ntend to fit together as whole pieces, and are thus relatively discrete\nand well-developed proposals. The following subsections outline five\nprominent models. Specific attention is paid to the normative\nunderpinnings, institutional design, and problems of feasibility and\ndesirability associated with each model.\n",
