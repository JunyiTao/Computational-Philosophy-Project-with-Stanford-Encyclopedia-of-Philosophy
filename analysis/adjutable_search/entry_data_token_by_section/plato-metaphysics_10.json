    "main_text": "Recollection in the Phaedo\n11. Recollection in the Phaedo\n\n\nThe Phaedo's discussion of recollection begins with a\nremark by Cebes in support of the claim that our souls preexist their\nincarceration in the body: \u201cSuch is also the case if that theory\nis true that you are accustomed to mention frequently, that for us\nlearning is no other than recollection. According to this, we must at\nsome previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible\nonly if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human\nshape\u201d (72e-73).\n\n\nOf special importance in this initial description is the \u2018for\nus\u2019 and the identification of learning (mathesis) with\nrecollection. There is no way to determine whether \u2018we\u2019\nhere are the close, philosophical confidants of Socrates, or the human\nrace. Part of the solution to the problem of who recollects will hinge\non how we understand the claim that learning is nothing other than\nrecollection. On the broad reading, recollection concerns the\napplication of concepts in all thought (see, most recently, Bedu-Addo\n1991).  That is, since learning is a dynamic process whose termini are\nroughly our first thoughts and talk about the world, on the one hand,\nand knowledge of Forms on the other, and since in thinking and talking\nabout the world we must apply concepts, recollection is viewed as a\ndoctrine of innate ideas whose effects are felt almost immediately in\nthe conscious mind.\n\n\nThose who would limit the kind of learning that is recollection\nisolate the last stage(s) of learning, namely those concerned with the\nmove from beliefs about the (properties of) the material world to\nknowledge of Forms (see, most recently, Scott 1995; Bobonich 2002,\nCh. 1).  Since only philosophers will engage in these late stages, the\n\u2018us\u2019 for whom learning is recollection are only\nphilosophers, and what is learned/recollected is just Forms. On this\nnarrow reading Plato would have to offer an account of ordinary\nthought and talk, i.e., an account of concept acquisition and\napplication, which claims that the concepts so deployed by most of us\nare derived from ordinary particulars and acquired through our\nconversations with one another and our sense-perceptions and beliefs\nabout physical objects. In sum, both readings agree that Plato is\nconcerned to explain the distinctive capacity of humans to classify\nsense-perception under universals. According to the broad reading,\nPlato thinks that this cannot be done unless one appeals to one's\nprior, latent knowledge of the Forms under which one ranges\nperceptions. According to the narrow reading, there is no need to\nappeal to prior knowledge of Forms to explain the ordinary\nclassificatory activities of humans. Rather, prior knowledge of Forms\nis needed only to explain the philosophical understanding of Forms.\nInnate Forms thus need not contribute anything to the formation of\nconcepts in ordinary thought and talk. Precisely what the relation is\nbetween the concepts garnered from ordinary perception and used in\nordinary thought and talk and the innate Forms or concepts used in\nphilosophical thinking remains to be determined.\n\n\nConcepts are, roughly, the units or elements of thoughts. In the\nTheaetetus (189e), a dialogue written after the\nRepublic and Phaedo, Plato contends that thought is\nthe silent dialogue of the soul with itself. If we can read back from\nthis dialogue to the epistemology of the middle period, concepts are\nconceptual analogues to the subjects and predicates of spoken\nstatements: corresponding to the predicate \u2018equal\u2019 of a\nstatement such as \u2018The sticks are equal\u2019 is the concept\n[equality]. To debate whether there are ordinary versus philosophical\nconcepts of [equality] thus invites consideration of how to distinguish\nconcepts from one another. Basic in the Phaedo is that we have\nknowledge of Equality; that we perceive sensible equal objects, that we\ncompare these sensible equals with the Form, and that in order to do\nthis we must have had prior knowledge of Equality. Now, one question is\nwhether the same concept applies both to the Form and the particulars.\nWhereas we moderns often focus on synonymy to distinguish\nco-referential concepts, issues of reference dominate Plato's thoughts.\nBy the end of the Final Argument, it is clear that in a strict or\nprimary fashion the concept/term is applied to the Form and in an\nindirect manner it is applied to the many instances that fall under the\nForm. (Using the language of names, \u2018equal\u2019 is the name of\nEquality and the eponym of the many particular equal things. (Cf.\n102bff) With respect to the concept of Equality, it is individuated by\nits relation to the Form of Equality and, at best, derivatively to the\nmany\n equals.[22]\n What individuates concepts or names, is\nnot what is in the head of speakers, but rather just their relation to\nForms.\n\n\nThis privileging of reference over meaning with respect to what a\nconcept is lends credence to the broad or innatist interpretation of\nwhat it is to acquire or even to have a concept. One has the concept\nfrom birth. One is not aware of having it. As you mature, learn to\nspeak and make your way in the world, you may and in all likelihood\nwill associate many beliefs or things with this concept, though still\nyou might not think of it as a concept. (That is, nothing in Plato's\naccount suggests that people need be aware of having a concept qua\nconcept in order to have or even use concepts.) Conversely, lacking the\nindividuation condition for concepts provided by Forms and Innatism,\nthe narrow reading must provide an account of how one acquires any\nconcept. There is little in the primary or secondary literature to\nsuggest how concepts are acquired. Though it is a controversial\ndialogue with respect to doctrine and period, the Cratylus\u2019\nrejection of the Protagorean/Heraclitean account of names (383\u2013387c,\n434e-435d), strongly suggests that Plato thinks that no empiricist or\nabstractionist account is workable. One problem, then, with the narrow\ninterpretation is its picture of (ordinary) concepts and their\ncontents. Concepts are treated as hollow shells to be filled with\nvarying beliefs or ideas, contents gleaned from conversations with one\nanother or contact with the world. Into my concept of beauty goes pale\nskinned, into yours bright color, into a third, some other filling. The\nproblem is that if the concept itself is identified with its\ncontents, then there is no reason to think that any of us have the same\nconcept. There are just too many different beliefs associated with a\nconcept by different individuals to think that anyone could ever mean\nthe same as another. Empiricism with respect to concept acquisition is\nliable to lead to private languages at best. Moreover, it would seem\nthat our concept changes anytime we add or subtract from its\ncontents.\n\n\nOf course, the fact that there are philosophical objections to the\nnarrow reading should not dictate that we reject it. The broad reading\nmay also have problems. Indeed, Plato's account of Recollection,\nwhatever it is, is liable to suffer difficulties. So what is the\naccount?\n\n\nAt the outset (73c-74a), Socrates places certain conditions on what\nis to count as recollection. If x reminds one of y,\nthen\n\none must have known y beforehand\none must, in having any sense-perception of something (x),\nrecognize x and take y in mind (think of\ny)\ny must not be the object of the same knowledge as\nx.\nSince recollection can be occasioned by objects that are similar\nand by objects that are dissimilar (Simmias and a picture of Simmias\nversus Simmias and his lyre), when the recollection is caused by\nsimilar things, one must also of necessity experience this: one must\nhave in mind whether or not x is lacking in some way with\nrespect to similarity vis \u00e0 vis y.\n\n\n\nIt is not clear how these conditions can be satisfied. In order to\nrecollect Simmias upon seeing his picture, (1) I must have known\nSimmias beforehand and (2) I must be somehow cognizant of the picture\nand of Simmias. (3) And were Simmias and his picture not the\nobjects of different knowledge, that is, were they the object of the\nsame knowledge, it seems that I would not realize that they are\ndifferent objects. The picture would not remind me of Simmias, it would\njust be thought of as a picture (or as Simmias). But, recognizing the\npicture cannot involve recognizing Simmias, lest we already be\nthinking of Simmias (y) in thinking about the picture\n(x): that is, we cannot be reminded of what we are\noccurrently thinking about. There must then be a way of\ncognizing the picture apart from what it is a picture of. Condition 3\nis more transparent when we consider recollection from\nunlikes: we can recognize a lyre as a lyre or as a musical\ninstrument, a piece of wood with strings, etc., easily enough without\nintroducing Simmias in order to think about it. Condition 4 then spells\nout the peculiar way in which recollection from likes occurs;\ne.g., we realize that a picture or image is different from what it is a\npicture of: images fall short or are lacking in some respect with\nregard to what they are an image of. We recognize this perhaps because\nwe recognize that it is an image and that images always are deficient\nwith respect to what they are images of. But we need not be thinking of\nthe very thing the image is an image of in order to recognize these\nfacts.\n\n\nThe argument to this point is a preliminary sketch of recollection.\nThe next stage attempts to prove that one can and must recollect Forms,\nsince only with that proof will Socrates have demonstrated the\npre-existence of the soul. So Plato turns to showing that we cannot\nhave acquired knowledge of the Form Equality from perceptual\nencounters. But 2, 3 and 4, when applied to the example of the equal\nsticks, appear to land the doctrine in difficulties. For it seems that\nif, according to 4, we need to be comparing the equal sticks to the\nForm of Equality, then we need to be aware of the Form in thinking of\nthe sticks. But if we must be aware of the Form even to think about the\nequal sticks then we must already have the Form in mind in\nconducting the comparison. We cannot then be in the process of forming\nthe concept of Equality nor recollecting the Form.\n\n\nThe next stage finds Socrates getting Simmias' rapid agreement that\nthere is an Equal that they know besides the equal sticks and stones.\n(74ab). The question is whence they acquired this knowledge. It cannot\nhave been from the sticks and stones from which it differs; for they\ncan sometimes appear equal and sometimes unequal, whereas Equality\nItself, on the other hand, never appears unequal. Socrates concludes\nthat we cannot have derived our knowledge of Equality from these many\nequals because we realize that they are deficient or lacking with\nrespect to Equality. He does not specify in what way they are lacking,\nsave for the aforementioned fact that they can and do appear unequal\nwhereas Equality does not and apparently cannot do so.\n\n\nPlato provides little guidance in this argument or elsewhere as to why\nthe Form cannot appear to be unequal (See White 1987; 1992).  Perhaps\nthe easiest way to parse the Form's insusceptibility to appearing\nunequal is to treat the claim as implying that the Form cannot appear\nother than itself, i.e., equal. This fact, in turn, would then be\nexplained by citing the Form's incomposite, or simple, nature (See\n\u00a74, supra). Equality could then have no other property\n(or be no other property). Thus, to be aware of it at all would be to\nrecognize it as equal. Of course there remains the problem of\ndistinguishing being aware of the Form from thinking one is aware of\nthe Form when one is not. In this circumstance, one could perhaps\nmistakenly think all sorts of things about the Form. A related but\ndistinct consideration is to determine whether it is possible in some\nsense to have the Form in mind without being aware of it. Certainly\nthe broad or innatist reading must allow for this possibility, since\nForms are regarded as latent in one's mind.\n\n\nIf Forms are not utterly simple, then this explanation of their\nimmunity to appearing other than they are is weakened. Suppose that\nEquality is also beautiful. Then in some fashion, it would seem that by\nattending to its beauty Equality could seem other than Equality and\nthus seem unequal. In order to avoid this outcome, while allowing for\nsome complexity in the Form, those emphasizing the compresence of\nopposites can insist that it is the strict opposite, Inequality or\nbeing unequal, that Plato excludes from the Form, not another property,\ne.g., beauty, which happens not to be identical with Equality.\n\n\nAlternatively, the predicationalist (See \u00a74 supra.), who\nemphasizes the special relation between a Form and its essence,\nmaintains that in knowing Equality, one knows what it is, that is, one\nknows its essence. This essence is itself simple or a unity, despite\nthe apparent complexity of the linguistic definition that picks it out.\nOne is not aware, or at least one is not knowingly aware, of Equality\nunless one knows this definition. Whatever else may be predicable of\nEquality, one cannot be aware of Equality without realizing that it is\nwhatever it is, namely this essence. Regardless of how we understand\nthe difference between the Form and the sticks, Plato seems only to\nhave shown that the Form and the particulars are not identical. How we\nare to conclude that one cannot derive the knowledge of the Form from\nthe sensibles is not revealed.\n",
