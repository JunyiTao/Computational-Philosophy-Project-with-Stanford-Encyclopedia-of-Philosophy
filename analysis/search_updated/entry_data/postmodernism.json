    "preamble": "\n\n\nThat postmodernism is indefinable is a truism. However, it can be\ndescribed as a set of critical, strategic and rhetorical practices\nemploying concepts such as difference, repetition, the trace, the\nsimulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as\npresence, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the\nunivocity of meaning.  \n\nThe term \u201cpostmodernism\u201d first entered the philosophical\nlexicon in 1979, with the publication of The Postmodern\nCondition by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard. I therefore give\nLyotard pride of place in the sections that follow. An economy of\nselection dictated the choice of other figures for this entry. I have\nselected only those most commonly cited in discussions of\nphilosophical postmodernism, five French and two Italian, although\nindividually they may resist common affiliation. Ordering them by\nnationality might duplicate a modernist schema they would question,\nbut there are strong differences among them, and these tend to divide\nalong linguistic and cultural lines. The French, for example, work\nwith concepts developed during the structuralist revolution in Paris\nin the 1950s and early 1960s, including structuralist readings of Marx\nand Freud. For this reason they are often called\n\u201cpoststructuralists.\u201d They also cite the events of May\n1968 as a watershed moment for modern thought and its institutions,\nespecially the universities. The Italians, by contrast, draw upon a\ntradition of aesthetics and rhetoric including figures such as\nGiambattista Vico and Benedetto Croce. Their emphasis is strongly\nhistorical, and they exhibit no fascination with a revolutionary\nmoment. Instead, they emphasize continuity, narrative, and difference\nwithin continuity, rather than counter-strategies and discursive\ngaps. Neither side, however, suggests that postmodernism is an attack\nupon modernity or a complete departure from it. Rather, its\ndifferences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a\ncontinuation of modern thinking in another mode.\n\nFinally, I have included a summary of Habermas's critique of\npostmodernism, representing the main lines of discussion on both sides\nof the Atlantic. Habermas argues that postmodernism contradicts itself\nthrough self-reference, and notes that postmodernists presuppose\nconcepts they otherwise seek to undermine, e.g., freedom,\nsubjectivity, or creativity. He sees in this a rhetorical application\nof strategies employed by the artistic avant-garde of the nineteenth\nand twentieth centuries, an avant-garde that is possible only because\nmodernity separates artistic values from science and politics in the\nfirst place.  On his view, postmodernism is an illicit\naestheticization of knowledge and public discourse.  Against this,\nHabermas seeks to rehabilitate modern reason as a system of procedural\nrules for achieving consensus and agreement among communicating\nsubjects. Insofar as postmodernism introduces aesthetic playfulness\nand subversion into science and politics, he resists it in the name of\na modernity moving toward completion rather than\nself-transformation.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Precursors\n\nThe philosophical modernism at issue in postmodernism begins with\nKant's \u201cCopernican revolution,\u201d that is, his assumption\nthat we cannot know things in themselves and that objects of knowledge\nmust conform to our faculties of representation (Kant 1787).  Ideas\nsuch as God, freedom, immortality, the world, first beginning, and\nfinal end have only a regulative function for knowledge, since they\ncannot find fulfilling instances among objects of experience. With\nHegel, the immediacy of the subject-object relation itself is shown to\nbe illusory. As he states in The Phenomenology of Spirit,\n\u201cwe find that neither the one nor the other is\nonly immediately present in sense-certainty, but each is at\nthe same time mediated\u201d (Hegel 1807, 59), because\nsubject and object are both instances of a \u201cthis\u201d and a\n\u201cnow,\u201d neither of which are immediately sensed. So-called\nimmediate perception therefore lacks the certainty of immediacy\nitself, a certainty that must be deferred to the working out of a\ncomplete system of experience.  However, later thinkers point out that\nHegel's logic pre-supposes concepts, such as identity and negation\n(see Hegel 1812), which cannot themselves be accepted as immediately\ngiven, and which therefore must be accounted for in some other,\nnon-dialectical way. \n\nThe later nineteenth century is the age of modernity as an achieved\nreality, where science and technology, including networks of mass\ncommunication and transportation, reshape human perceptions. There is\nno clear distinction, then, between the natural and the artificial in\nexperience. Indeed, many proponents of postmodernism challenge the\nviability of such a distinction tout court, seeing in\nachieved modernism the emergence of a problem the philosophical\ntradition has repressed. A consequence of achieved modernism is what\npostmodernists might refer to as de-realization. De-realization\naffects both the subject and the objects of experience, such that\ntheir sense of identity, constancy, and substance is upset or\ndissolved. Important precursors to this notion are found in\nKierkegaard, Marx and Nietzsche. Kierkegaard, for example, describes\nmodern society as a network of relations in which individuals are\nleveled into an abstract phantom known as \u201cthe public\u201d\n(Kierkegaard 1846, 59). The modern public, in contrast to ancient and\nmedieval communities, is a creation of the press, which is the only\ninstrument capable of holding together the mass of unreal individuals\n\u201cwho never are and never can be united in an actual situation or\norganization\u201d (Kierkegaard 1846, 60). In this sense, society has\nbecome a realization of abstract thought, held together by an\nartificial and all-pervasive medium speaking for everyone and for no\none. In Marx, on the other hand, we have an analysis of the fetishism\nof commodities (Marx 1867, 444\u2013461) where objects lose the\nsolidity of their use value and become spectral figures under the\naspect of exchange value. Their ghostly nature results from their\nabsorption into a network of social relations, where their values\nfluctuate independently of their corporeal being. Human subjects\nthemselves experience this de-realization because commodities are\nproducts of their labor. Workers paradoxically lose their being in\nrealizing themselves, and this becomes emblematic for those professing\na postmodern sensibility.\n\nWe also find suggestions of de-realization in Nietzsche, who speaks of\nbeing as \u201cthe last breath of a vaporizing reality\u201d and\nremarks upon the dissolution of the distinction between the\n\u201creal\u201d and the \u201capparent\u201d\nworld. In Twilight of the Idols, he traces the history of\nthis distinction from Plato to his own time, where the \u201ctrue\nworld\u201d becomes a useless and superfluous idea (1889,\n485\u201386). However, with the notion of the true world, he says, we\nhave also done away with the apparent one. What is left is neither\nreal nor apparent, but something in between, and therefore something\nakin to the virtual reality of more recent vintage.\n\nThe notion of a collapse between the real and the apparent is\nsuggested in Nietzsche's first book, The Birth of Tragedy\n(Nietzsche 1872), where he presents Greek tragedy as a synthesis of\nnatural art impulses represented by the gods Apollo and\nDionysus. Where Apollo is the god of beautiful forms and images,\nDionysus is the god of frenzy and intoxication, under whose sway the\nspell of individuated existence is broken in a moment of\nundifferentiated oneness with nature. While tragic art is\nlife-affirming in joining these two impulses, logic and science are\nbuilt upon Apollonian representations that have become frozen and\nlifeless. Hence, Nietzsche believes only a return of the Dionysian art\nimpulse can save modern society from sterility and nihilism. This\ninterpretation presages postmodern concepts of art and representation,\nand also anticipates postmodernists' fascination with the prospect of\na revolutionary moment auguring a new, anarchic sense of\ncommunity.\n\nNietzsche is also a precursor for postmodernism in his genealogical\nanalyses of fundamental concepts, especially what he takes to be the\ncore concept of Western metaphysics, the \u201cI\u201d. On\nNietzsche's account, the concept of the \u201cI\u201d arises out of\na moral imperative to be responsible for our actions. In order to be\nresponsible we must assume that we are the cause of our actions, and\nthis cause must hold over time, retaining its identity, so that\nrewards and punishments are accepted as consequences for actions\ndeemed beneficial or detrimental to others (Nietzsche 1889, 482-83;\n1887, 24-26, 58-60). In this way, the concept of the \u201cI\u201d\ncomes about as a social construction and moral illusion. According to\nNietzsche, the moral sense of the \u201cI\u201d as an identical\ncause is projected onto events in the world, where the identity of\nthings, causes, effects, etc., takes shape in easily communicable\nrepresentations. Thus logic is born from the demand to adhere to\ncommon social norms which shape the human herd into a society of\nknowing and acting subjects.\n\nFor postmodernists, Nietzsche's genealogy of concepts in \u201cOn\nTruth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\u201d (Nietzsche 1873,\n77\u201397) is also an important reference. In this text, Nietzsche\nputs forward the hypothesis that scientific concepts are chains of\nmetaphors hardened into accepted truths. On this account, metaphor\nbegins when a nerve stimulus is copied as an image, which is then\nimitated in sound, giving rise, when repeated, to the word, which\nbecomes a concept when the word is used to designate multiple\ninstances of singular events. Conceptual metaphors are thus lies\nbecause they equate unequal things, just as the chain of metaphors\nmoves from one level to another. Hegel's problem with the repetition\nof the \u201cthis\u201d and the \u201cnow\u201d is thus expanded\nto include the repetition of instances across discontinuous gaps\nbetween kinds and levels of things.\n\nIn close connection with this genealogy, Nietzsche criticizes the\nhistoricism of the nineteenth century in the 1874 essay, \u201cOn\nthe Uses and Disadvantage of History for Life\u201d (Nietzsche 1874,\n57\u2013123). On Nietzsche's view, the life of an individual and a\nculture depend upon their ability to repeat an unhistorical moment, a\nkind of forgetfulness, along with their continuous development\nthrough time, and the study of history ought therefore to emphasize\nhow each person or culture attains and repeats this moment. There is\nno question, then, of reaching a standpoint outside of history or of\nconceiving past times as stages on the way to the present. Historical\nrepetition is not linear, but each age worthy of its designation\nrepeats the unhistorical moment that is its own present as\n\u201cnew.\u201d In this respect, Nietzsche would agree with\nCharles Baudelaire, who describes modernity as \u201cthe transient,\nthe fleeting, the contingent\u201d that is repeated in all ages\n(Cahoone 2003, 100), and postmodernists read Nietzsche's remarks on\nthe eternal return accordingly.\n\nNietzsche presents this concept in The Gay Science\n(Nietzsche 1974 [1882], 273), and in a more developed form\nin Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Nietzsche 1883\u20131891,\n269\u2013272). Many have taken the concept to imply an endless,\nidentical repetition of everything in the universe, such that nothing\noccurs that has not already occurred an infinite number of times\nbefore. However, others, including postmodernists, read these\npassages in conjunction with the notion that history is the\nrepetition of an unhistorical moment, a moment that is always new in\neach case. In their view, Nietzsche can only mean that the new\neternally repeats as new, and therefore recurrence is a matter of\ndifference rather than identity. Furthermore, postmodernists join the\nconcept of eternal return with the loss of the distinction between\nthe real and the apparent world. The distinction itself does not\nreappear, and what repeats is neither real nor apparent in the\ntraditional sense, but is a phantasm or simulacrum. \n\nNietzsche is a common interest between postmodern philosophers and\nMartin Heidegger, whose meditations on art, technology, and the\nwithdrawal of being they regularly cite and comment upon. Heidegger's\ncontribution to the sense of de-realization of the world stems from\noft repeated remarks such as: \u201cEverywhere we are underway amid\nbeings, and yet we no longer know how it stands with being\u201d\n(Heidegger 2000 [1953], 217), and \u201cprecisely nowhere does\nman today any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence\u201d\n(Heidegger 1993, 332). Heidegger sees modern technology as the\nfulfillment of Western metaphysics, which he characterizes as the\nmetaphysics of presence. From the time of the earliest philosophers,\nbut definitively with Plato, says Heidegger, Western thought has\nconceived of being as the presence of beings, which in the modern\nworld has come to mean the availability of beings for use. In fact,\nas he writes in Being and Time, the presence of beings tends\nto disappear into the transparency of their usefulness as things\nready-to-hand (Heidegger 1962 [1927], 95-107). The essence of\ntechnology, which he names \u201cthe enframing,\u201d reduces the\nbeing of entities to a calculative order (Heidegger 1993,\n311-341). Hence, the mountain is not a mountain but a standing supply\nof coal, the Rhine is not the Rhine but an engine for hydro-electric\nenergy, and humans are not humans but reserves of manpower. The\nexperience of the modern world, then, is the experience of being's\nwithdrawal in face of the enframing and its sway over\nbeings. However, humans are affected by this withdrawal in moments of\nanxiety or boredom, and therein lies the way to a possible return of\nbeing, which would be tantamount to a repetition of the experience of\nbeing opened up by Parmenides and Heraclitus.\n\nHeidegger sees this as the realization of the will to power, another\nNietzschean conception, which, conjoined with the eternal return,\nrepresents the exhaustion of the metaphysical tradition (Heidegger\n1991a, 199-203). For Heidegger, the will to power is the eternal\nrecurrence as becoming, and the permanence of becoming is the\nterminal moment of the metaphysics of presence. On this reading,\nbecoming is the emerging and passing away of beings within and among\nother beings instead of an emergence from being. Thus, for Heidegger,\nNietzsche marks the end of metaphysical thinking but not a passage\nbeyond it, and therefore Heidegger sees him as the last metaphysician\nin whom the oblivion of being is complete (Heidegger 1991a, 204-206;\n1991b, 199-203). Hope for a passage into non-metaphysical thinking\nlies rather with H\u00f6lderlin, whose verses give voice to signs\ngranted by being in its withdrawal (Heidegger 1994 [1937\u20131938],\n115-118). While postmodernists owe much to Heidegger's reflections on\nthe non-presence of being and the de-realization of beings through\nthe technological enframing, they sharply diverge from his reading of\nNietzsche.\n\nMany postmodern philosophers find in Heidegger a nostalgia for being\nthey do not share.  They prefer, instead, the sense of cheerful\nforgetting and playful creativity in Nietzsche's eternal return as a\nrepetition of the different and the new. Some have gone so far as to\nturn the tables on Heidegger, and to read his ruminations on\nmetaphysics as the repetition of an original metaphysical gesture,\nthe gathering of thought to its \u201cproper\u201d essence and\nvocation (see Derrida 1989 [1987]). In this gathering, which follows\nthe lineaments of an exclusively Greco-Christian-German tradition,\nsomething more original than being is forgotten, and that is the\ndifference and alterity against which, and with which, the tradition\ncomposes itself.  Prominent authors associated with postmodernism\nhave noted that the forgotten and excluded \u201cother\u201d of the\nWest, including Heidegger, is figured by the Jew (see Lyotard 1990\n[1988], and Lacoue-Labarthe 1990 [1988]). In this way, they are able\nto distinguish their projects from Heidegger's thinking and to\ncritically account for his involvement with National Socialism and\nhis silence about the Holocaust, albeit in terms that do not address\nthese as personal failings. Those looking for personal condemnations\nof Heidegger for his actions and his \u201crefusal to accept\nresponsibility\u201d will not find them in postmodernist\ncommentaries. They will, however, find many departures from Heidegger\non Nietzsche's philosophical significance (see Derrida 1979 [1978]),\nand many instances where Nietzsche's ideas are critically activated\nagainst Heidegger and his self-presentation.\n Nevertheless, Heidegger and Nietzsche are both important sources\nfor postmodernism's critical de-structuring or displacement of the\nsignature concept of modern philosophy, the \u201csubject,\u201d\nwhich is generally understood as consciousness, or its identity,\nground, or unity, and designated as the \u201cI.\u201d Where\nNietzsche finds in this concept the original metaphysical error\nproduced by morality and the communicative needs of the herd,\nHeidegger sees in it the end and exhaustion of the metaphysical\ntradition, inaugurated by the Greeks, in which being is interpreted as\npresence.  Here, being is the underlying ground of the being of\nbeings, the subiectum that is enacted in modern philosophy as\nthe subject of consciousness.  But in Being and Time Heidegger\nconceives the human being as Dasein, which is not simply a\npresent consciousness, but an event of ecstatic temporality that is\nopen to a past (Gewesensein) that was never present\n(its already being-there) and a future (Zu-kunft) that\nis always yet to come (the possibility of death).  The finitude\nof Dasein therefore cannot be contained within the limits of\nconsciousness, nor within the limits of the subject, whether it is\nconceived substantively or formally.\nIn addition to the critiques of the subject offered by Nietzsche\nand Heidegger, many postmodernists also borrow heavily from the\npsycho-analytic theories of Jacques Lacan.  Lacan's distinctive\ngesture is his insistence that the Freudian unconscious is a function,\nor set of functions, belonging to language and particularly to the\nverbal exchanges between the analyst and analysand during the analytic\nsession (see Lacan 1953\u201355).  For Lacan, the subject is always the\nsubject of speech, and that means speech directed toward\nan other in relation to whom the subject differentiates and\nidentifies itself.  On this view, language is a feature of the\n\u201csymbolic order\u201d of society, which is constituted as an\neconomy of signifiers, through which animal need becomes human desire,\nwhose first object is to be recognized by the other.  However, desire\nultimately aims for something impossible: to possess, to\n\u201cbe,\u201d or to occupy the place of the signifier of\nsignifiers, i.e. the phallus.  Insofar as the phallus is nothing but\nthe signifying function as such, it does not exist.  It is not\nan object to be possessed, but is that through which the subject and\nthe other are brought into relation to begin with, and it thus imposes\nitself upon the subject as a fundamental absence or lack that is at\nonce necessary and irremediable (Lacan 1977, 289).  Hence the subject\nis forever divided from itself and unable to achieve final unity or\nidentity.  As the subject of desire, it remains perpetually\nincomplete, just as Dasein in Heidegger exists \u201cbeyond\nitself\u201d in temporal ecstasis.\n2. The Postmodern Condition\n\nThe term \u201cpostmodern\u201d came into the philosophical lexicon\nwith the publication of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's La\nCondition Postmoderne in 1979 (in English: The Postmodern\nCondition: A Report on Knowledge, 1984), where he employs\nWittgenstein's model of language games (see Wittgenstein 1953) and\nconcepts taken from speech act theory to account for what he calls a\ntransformation of the game rules for science, art, and literature\nsince the end of the nineteenth century. He describes his text as a\ncombination of two very different language games, that of the\nphilosopher and that of the expert. Where the expert knows what he\nknows and what he doesn't know, the philosopher knows neither, but\nposes questions. In light of this ambiguity, Lyotard states that his\nportrayal of the state of knowledge \u201cmakes no claims to being\noriginal or even true,\u201d and that his hypotheses \u201cshould\nnot be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but\nstrategic value in relation to the questions raised\u201d (Lyotard\n1984 [1979], 7).  The book, then, is as much an experiment in the\ncombination of language games as it is an objective\n\u201creport.\u201d\n\nOn Lyotard's account, the computer age has transformed knowledge into\ninformation, that is, coded messages within a system of transmission\nand communication. Analysis of this knowledge calls for a pragmatics\nof communication insofar as the phrasing of messages, their\ntransmission and reception, must follow rules in order to be accepted\nby those who judge them. However, as Lyotard points out, the position\nof judge or legislator is also a position within a language game, and\nthis raises the question of legitimation. As he insists, \u201cthere\nis a strict interlinkage between the kind of language called science\nand the kind called ethics and politics\u201d (Lyotard 1984 [1979],\n8), and this interlinkage constitutes the cultural perspective of the\nWest. Science is therefore tightly interwoven with government and\nadministration, especially in the information age, where enormous\namounts of capital and large installations are needed for\nresearch.\n\nLyotard points out that while science has sought to distinguish\nitself from narrative knowledge in the form of tribal wisdom\ncommunicated through myths and legends, modern philosophy has sought\nto provide legitimating narratives for science in the form of\n\u201cthe dialectics of Spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the\nemancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of\nwealth,\u201d (Lyotard 1984 [1979], xxiii). Science, however, plays\nthe language game of denotation to the exclusion of all others, and\nin this respect it displaces narrative knowledge, including the\nmeta-narratives of philosophy. This is due, in part, to what Lyotard\ncharacterizes as the rapid growth of technologies and techniques in\nthe second half of the twentieth century, where the emphasis of\nknowledge has shifted from the ends of human action to its means\n(Lyotard 1984 [1979], 37). This has eroded the speculative game of\nphilosophy and set each science free to develop independently of\nphilosophical grounding or systematic organization. \u201cI\ndefine postmodern as incredulity toward\nmeta-narratives,\u201d says Lyotard (Lyotard 1984 [1979], xxiv). As\na result, new, hybrid disciplines develop without connection to old\nepistemic traditions, especially philosophy, and this means science\nonly plays its own game and cannot legitimate others, such as moral\nprescription.\n\nThe compartmentalization of knowledge and the dissolution of\nepistemic coherence is a concern for researchers and philosophers\nalike. As Lyotard notes, \u201cLamenting the \u2018loss of\nmeaning\u2019 in postmodernity boils down to mourning the fact that\nknowledge is no longer principally narrative\u201d (Lyotard 1984\n[1979], 26). Indeed, for Lyotard, the de-realization of the world\nmeans the disintegration of narrative elements into\n\u201cclouds\u201d of linguistic combinations and collisions among\ninnumerable, heterogeneous language games.  Furthermore, within each\ngame the subject moves from position to position, now as sender, now\nas addressee, now as referent, and so on. The loss of a continuous\nmeta-narrative therefore breaks the subject into heterogeneous\nmoments of subjectivity that do not cohere into an identity. But as\nLyotard points out, while the combinations we experience are not\nnecessarily stable or communicable, we learn to move with a certain\nnimbleness among them.\n\nPostmodern sensibility does not lament the loss of narrative\ncoherence any more than the loss of being. However, the dissolution\nof narrative leaves the field of legitimation to a new unifying\ncriterion: the performativity of the knowledge-producing system whose\nform of capital is information. Performative legitimation means\nmaximizing the flow of information and minimizing static\n(non-functional moves) in the system, so whatever cannot be\ncommunicated as information must be eliminated. The performativity\ncriterion threatens anything not meeting its requirements, such as\nspeculative narratives, with de-legitimation and\nexclusion. Nevertheless, capital also demands the continual\nre-invention of the \u201cnew\u201d in the form of new language\ngames and new denotative statements, and so, paradoxically, a\ncertain paralogy is required by the system itself. In this\nregard, the modern paradigm of progress as new moves under\nestablished rules gives way to the postmodern paradigm of inventing\nnew rules and changing the game.\n\nInventing new codes and reshaping information is a large part of the\nproduction of knowledge, and in its inventive moment science does not\nadhere to performative efficiency. By the same token, the\nmeta-prescriptives of science, its rules, are themselves objects of\ninvention and experimentation for the sake of producing new\nstatements. In this respect, says Lyotard, the model of knowledge as\nthe progressive development of consensus is outmoded. In fact,\nattempts to retrieve the model of consensus can only repeat the\nstandard of coherence demanded for functional efficiency, and they\nwill thus lend themselves to the domination of capital. On the other\nhand, the paralogical inventiveness of science raises the possibility\nof a new sense of justice, as well as knowledge, as we move among the\nlanguage games now entangling us.\n\nLyotard takes up the question of justice in Just Gaming (see\nLyotard 1985 [1979]) and The Differend: Phrases in\nDispute (see Lyotard 1988 [1983]), where he combines the model\nof language games with Kant's division of the faculties\n(understanding, imagination, reason) and types of judgment\n(theoretical, practical, aesthetic) in order to explore the problem\nof justice set out in The Postmodern Condition. Without the\nformal unity of the subject, the faculties are set free to operate on\ntheir own. Where Kant insists that reason must assign domains and\nlimits to the other faculties, its dependence upon the unity of the\nsubject for the identity of concepts as laws or rules de-legitimizes\nits juridical authority in the postmodern age. Instead, because we\nare faced with an irreducible plurality of judgments and\n\u201cphrase regimes,\u201d the faculty of judgment itself is\nbrought to the fore. Kant's third Critique therefore\nprovides the conceptual materials for Lyotard's analysis, especially\nthe analytic of aesthetic judgment (see Kant 1790).\n\nAs Lyotard argues, aesthetic judgment is the appropriate model for\nthe problem of justice in postmodern experience because we are\nconfronted with a plurality of games and rules without a concept\nunder which to unify them. Judgment must therefore be reflective\nrather than determining. Furthermore, judgment must be aesthetic\ninsofar as it does not produce denotative knowledge about a\ndeterminable state of affairs, but refers to the way our faculties\ninteract with each other as we move from one mode of phrasing to\nanother, i.e. the denotative, the prescriptive, the performative, the\npolitical, the cognitive, the artistic, etc. In Kantian terms, this\ninteraction registers as an aesthetic feeling. Where Kant emphasizes\nthe feeling of the beautiful as a harmonious interaction between\nimagination and understanding, Lyotard stresses the mode in which\nfaculties (imagination and reason,) are in disharmony, i.e. the\nfeeling of the sublime. For Kant, the sublime occurs when our\nfaculties of sensible presentation are overwhelmed by impressions of\nabsolute power and magnitude, and reason is thrown back upon its own\npower to conceive Ideas (such as the moral law) which surpass the\nsensible world. For Lyotard, however, the postmodern sublime occurs\nwhen we are affected by a multitude of unpresentables without\nreference to reason as their unifying origin. Justice, then, would\nnot be a definable rule, but an ability to move and judge among rules\nin their heterogeneity and multiplicity. In this respect, it would be\nmore akin to the production of art than a moral judgment in Kant's\nsense.\n\nIn \u201cWhat is Postmodernism?,\u201d which appears as an appendix\nto the English edition of The Postmodern Condition, Lyotard\naddresses the importance of avant-garde art in terms of the aesthetic\nof the sublime. Modern art, he says, is emblematic of a sublime\nsensibility, that is, a sensibility that there is something\nnon-presentable demanding to be put into sensible form and yet\noverwhelms all attempts to do so. But where modern art presents the\nunpresentable as a missing content within a beautiful form, as in\nMarcel Proust, postmodern art, exemplified by James Joyce, puts\nforward the unpresentable by forgoing beautiful form itself, thus\ndenying what Kant would call the consensus of taste. Furthermore,\nsays Lyotard, a work can become modern only if it is first\npostmodern, for postmodernism is not modernism at its end but in its\nnascent state, that is, at the moment it attempts to present the\nunpresentable, \u201cand this state is constant\u201d (Lyotard 1984\n[1979], 79). The postmodern, then, is a repetition of the modern as\nthe \u201cnew,\u201d and this means the ever-new demand for another\nrepetition.\n3. Genealogy and Subjectivity\n\nThe Nietzschean method of genealogy, in its application to modern\nsubjectivity, is another facet of philosophical postmodernism. Michel\nFoucault's application of genealogy to formative moments in\nmodernity's history and his exhortations to experiment with\nsubjectivity place him within the scope of postmodern discourse. In\nthe 1971 essay \u201cNietzsche, Genealogy, History,\u201d Foucault\nspells out his adaptation of the genealogical method in his\nhistorical studies. First and foremost, he says, genealogy\n\u201copposes itself to the search for \u2018origins\u2019\u201d\n(Foucault 1977, 141). That is, genealogy studies the accidents and\ncontingencies that converge at crucial moments, giving rise to new\nepochs, concepts, and institutions. As Foucault remarks: \u201cWhat\nis found at the historical beginning of things is not the inviolable\nidentity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is\ndisparity\u201d (Foucault 1977, 142). In Nietzschean fashion,\nFoucault exposes history conceived as the origin and development of\nan identical subject, e.g., \u201cmodernity,\u201d as a fiction\nmodern discourses invent after the fact. Underlying the fiction of\nmodernity is a sense of temporality that excludes the elements of\nchance and contingency in play at every moment. In short, linear,\nprogressive history covers up the discontinuities and interruptions\nthat mark points of succession in historical time.\n\nFoucault deploys genealogy to create what he calls a\n\u201ccounter-memory\u201d or \u201ca transformation of history\ninto a totally different form of time\u201d (Foucault 1977,\n160). This entails dissolving identity for the subject in history by\nusing the materials and techniques of modern historical\nresearch. Just as Nietzsche postulates that the religious will to\ntruth in Christianity results in the destruction of Christianity by\nscience (see Nietzsche 1974 [1882], 280\u201383), Foucault\npostulates that genealogical research will result in the\ndisintegration of the epistemic subject, as the continuity of the\nsubject is broken up by the gaps and accidents that historical\nresearch uncovers. The first example of this research is Histoire\nde la folie \u00e0 l'age classique, published in 1961, the\nfull version of which was published in English as History of\nMadness in 2006. Here, Foucault gives an account of the\nhistorical beginnings of modern reason as it comes to define itself\nagainst madness in the seventeenth century.  His thesis is that the\npractice of confining the mad is a transformation of the medieval\npractice of confining lepers in lazar houses. These institutions\nmanaged to survive long after the lepers disappeared, and thus an\ninstitutional structure of confinement was already in place when the\nmodern concept of madness as a disease took shape. However, while\ninstitutions of confinement are held over from a previous time, the\npractice of confining the mad constitutes a break with the past.\n\nFoucault focuses upon the moment of transition, as modern reason\nbegins to take shape in a confluence of concepts, institutions, and\npractices, or, as he would say, of knowledge and power. In its\nnascency, reason is a power that defines itself against an other, an\nother whose truth and identity is also assigned by reason, thus\ngiving reason the sense of originating from itself. For Foucault, the\nissue is that madness is not allowed to speak for itself and is at\nthe disposal of a power that dictates the terms of their\nrelationship. As he remarks: \u201cWhat is originative is the\ncaesura that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason;\nreason's subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as\nmadness, crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this\npoint\u201d (Foucault 1965, x). The truth of reason is found\nwhen madness comes to stand in the place of non-reason, when the\ndifference between them is inscribed in their opposition, but is not\nidentical to its dominant side. In other words, the reason that\nstands in opposition to madness is not identical to the reason that\ninscribes their difference. The latter would be reason without an\nopposite, a free-floating power without definite shape. As Foucault\nsuggests, this free-floating mystery might be represented in the ship\nof fools motif, which, in medieval times, represented madness. Such\nis the paradoxical structure of historical transformation.\n\nIn his later writings, most notably in The Use of Pleasure\n(Foucault 1985 [1984]), Foucault employs historical research to open\npossibilities for experimenting with subjectivity, by showing that\nsubjectivation is a formative power of the self, surpassing the\nstructures of knowledge and power from out of which it emerges. This\nis a power of thought, which Foucault says is the ability of human\nbeings to problematize the conditions under which they live. For\nphilosophy, this means \u201cthe endeavor to know how and to what\nextent it might be possible to think differently, instead of\nlegitimating what is already known\u201d (Foucault 1985 [1984],\n9). He thus joins Lyotard in promoting creative experimentation as a\nleading power of thought, a power that surpasses reason, narrowly\ndefined, and without which thought would be inert. In this regard,\nFoucault stands in league with others who profess a postmodern\nsensibility in regard to contemporary science, art, and society. We\nshould note, as well, that Foucault's writings are a hybrid of\nphilosophy and historical research, just as Lyotard combines the\nlanguage games of the expert and the philosopher in The\nPostmodern Condition. This mixing of philosophy with concepts\nand methods from other disciplines is characteristic of postmodernism\nin its broadest sense.\n4. Productive Difference\n\nThe concept of difference as a productive mechanism, rather than a\nnegation of identity, is also a hallmark of postmodernism in\nphilosophy.  Gilles Deleuze deploys this concept throughout his work,\nbeginning with Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962, in English\n1983), where he sets Nietzsche against the models of thinking at work\nin Kant and Hegel. Here, he proposes to think against reason\nin resistance to Kant's assertion of the self-justifying authority of\nreason alone (Deleuze 1983 [1962], 93). In a phrase echoed by\nFoucault, he states that the purpose of his critique of reason\n\u201cis not justification but a different way of feeling: another\nsensibility\u201d (Deleuze 1983 [1962], 94). Philosophical critique,\nhe declares, is an encounter between thought and what forces it into\naction: it is a matter of sensibility rather than a tribunal where\nreason judges itself by its own laws (see Kant 1787, 9). Furthermore,\nthe critique of reason is not a method, but is achieved by\n\u201cculture\u201d in the Nietzschean sense: training, discipline,\ninventiveness, and a certain cruelty (see Nietzsche 1887). Since\nthought cannot activate itself as thinking, Deleuze says it\nmust suffer violence if it is to awaken and move. Art, science, and\nphilosophy deploy such violence insofar as they are transformative\nand experimental. \n\nAgainst Hegel, Deleuze asserts that while dialectic is structured by\nnegation and opposition within a posited identity, \u201cdifference\nis the only principle of genesis or production\u201d (Deleuze 1983\n[1962], 157). Opposition occurs on the same logical plane, but\ndifference moves across planes and levels, and not only in one\ndirection. Furthermore, where Hegel takes the work of the negative to\nbe dialectic's driving power, Deleuze declares that difference is\nthinkable only as repetition repeating itself (as in Nietzsche's\neternal return), where difference affirms itself in eternally\ndiffering  from itself. Its movement is productive, but\nwithout logical opposition, negation, or necessity. Instead, chance\nand multiplicity are repeated, just as a dice-throw repeats the\nrandomness of the throw along with every number. On the other hand,\ndialectic cancels out chance and affirms the movement of the negative\nas a working out of identity, as in the Science of Logic\nwhere being in its immediacy is posited as equal only to itself\n(Hegel 1812, 82). For Deleuze, however, sensibility introduces an\naleatory moment into thought's development, making accidentality and\ncontingency conditions for thinking. These conditions upset logical\nidentity and opposition, and place the limit of thinking beyond any\ndialectical system.\n\nIn Difference and Repetition (1968, in English 1994),\nDeleuze develops his project in multiple directions. His work, he\nsays, stems from the convergence of two lines of research: the\nconcept of difference without negation, and the concept of\nrepetition, in which physical and mechanical repetitions are masks\nfor a hidden differential that is disguised and displaced. His major\nfocus is a thoroughgoing critique of representational thinking,\nincluding identity, opposition, analogy, and resemblance (Deleuze\n1994 [1968], 132). For Deleuze, \u201cappearances of\u201d are not\nrepresentations, but sensory intensities free of subjective or\nobjective identities (Deleuze 1994 [1968], 144). Without these\nidentities, appearances are simulacra of an non-apparent differential\nhe calls the \u201cdark precursor\u201d or \u201cthe in-itself of\ndifference\u201d (Deleuze 1994 [1968], 119). This differential is\nthe non-sensible being of the sensible, a being not\nidentical to the sensible, or to itself, but irreducibly problematic\ninsofar as it forces us to encounter the sensible as\n\u201cgiven.\u201d \n\nFurthermore, any move against representational thinking impinges upon\nthe identity of the subject. Where Kant founds the representational\nunity of space and time upon the formal unity of consciousness (Kant\n1787, 135-137), difference re-distributes intuitions of past,\npresent, and future, fracturing consciousness into multiple states\nnot predicable of a single subject. Intensive qualities are\nindividuating by themselves, says Deleuze, and individuality is not\ncharacteristic of a self or an ego, but of a differential forever\ndividing itself and changing its configuration (Deleuze 1994 [1968],\n246, 254, 257). In Nietzschean fashion, the \u201cI\u201d refers\nnot to the unity of consciousness, but to a multitude of simulacra\nwithout an identical subject for whom this multitude\nappears. Instead, subjects arise and multiply as\n\u201ceffects\u201d of the intensive qualities saturating space and\ntime. This leads Deleuze to postulate multiple faculties for\nsubjectivity, which are correlates of the sensible insofar as it\ngives rise to feeling, thought, and action. \u201cEach faculty,\nincluding thought, has only involuntary adventures,\u201d he says,\nand \u201cinvoluntary operation remains embedded in the\nempirical\u201d (Deleuze 1994 [1968], 145). Subjectively, the\nparadox of the differential breaks up the faculties' common function\nand places them before their own limits: thought before the\nunthinkable, memory before the immemorial, sensibility before the\nimperceptible, etc. (Deleuze 1994, 227). This fracturing and\nmultiplying of the subject, he notes, leads to the realization that\n\u201cschizophrenia is not only a human fact but also a possibility\nfor thought\u201d (Deleuze 1994 [1968], 148), thus expanding the\nterm into a philosophical concept, beyond its clinical\napplication.\n\nThe dissolution of the subject and its implications for society is\nthe theme of Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,\nwhich Deleuze published with F\u00e9lix Guattari in 1972 (in\nEnglish 1983). The book, in large part, is written against an\nestablished intellectual orthodoxy of the political Left in France\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, an orthodoxy consisting of Marx, Freud,\nand structuralist concepts applied to them by Louis Althusser and\nJacques Lacan. Deleuze and Guattari argue that this mixture is still\nlimited by representational thinking, including concepts of\nproduction based upon lack, and concepts of alienation based upon\nidentity and negation. Furthermore, the Oedipus concept in\npsychoanalysis, they say, institutes a theater of desire in which the\npsyche is embedded in a family drama closed off from the\nextra-familial and extra-psychic forces at work in society. They\ncharacterize these forces as \u201cdesiring machines\u201d whose\nfunction is to connect, disconnect, and reconnect with one another\nwithout meaning or intention. \n\nThe authors portray society as a series of\n\u201cterritorializations\u201d or inscriptions upon the\n\u201cbody without organs,\u201dor the free-flowing matter of\nintensive qualities filling space in their varying degrees. The first\ninscriptions are relations of kinship and filiation structuring\nprimitive societies, often involving the marking and scarring of\nhuman bodies. As an interruption and encoding of \u201cflows,\u201d\nthe primitive inscriptions constitute a nexus of desiring machines,\nboth technical and social, whose elements are humans and their\norgans. The full body of society is the sacred earth, which\nappropriates to itself all social products as their natural or divine\nprecondition, and to whom all members of society are bound by direct\nfiliation (Deleuze 1983 [1962], 141-42). These first inscriptions are\nthen de-territorialized and re-coded by the \u201cdespotic\nmachine,\u201d establishing new relations of alliance and filiation\nthrough the body of the ruler or emperor, who alone stands in direct\nfiliation to the deity (Deleuze 1983 [1962], 192) and who institutes\nthe mechanism of the state upon pre-existing social arrangements.\nFinally, capitalism de-territorializes the inscriptions of the\ndespotic machine and re-codes all relations of alliance and filiation\ninto flows of money (Deleuze 1983 [1962], 224-27). The organs of\nsociety and the state are appropriated into the functioning of\ncapital, and humans become secondary to the filiation of money with\nitself.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari see in the capitalist money system \u201can\naxiomatic of abstract quantities that keeps moving further and\nfurther in the direction of the deterritorialization of the\nsocius\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari 1983 [1972], 33), which is to say\nthat capital is inherently schizophrenic. However, because capital\nalso re-territorializes all flows into money, schizophrenia remains\ncapitalism's external limit. Nevertheless, it is precisely that limit\nagainst which thinking can subject capitalism to philosophical\ncritique. Psychoanalysis, they say, is part of the reign of capital\nbecause it re-territorializes the subject as \u201cprivate\u201d\nand \u201cindividual,\u201d instituting psychic identity through\nimages of the Oedipal family. However, the Oedipal triangle is merely\na representational simulacrum of kinship and filiation, re-coded\nwithin a system of debt and payment. In this system, they insist,\nflows of desire have become mere representations of desire, cut off\nfrom the body without organs and the extra-familial mechanisms of\nsociety. A radical critique of capital cannot therefore be\naccomplished by psychoanalysis, but requires\na schizoanalysis \u201cto overturn the theater of\nrepresentation into the order of desiring-production\u201d (Deleuze\n1983 [1962], 271). Here, the authors see a revolutionary potential in\nmodern art and science, where, in bringing about the\n\u201cnew,\u201d they circulate de-coded and de-territorialized\nflows within society without automatically re-coding them into money\n(Deleuze and Guattari 1983 [1972], 379). In this revolutionary\naspect, Anti-Oedipus reads as a statement of the desire that\ntook to the streets of Paris in May of 1968, and which continues,\neven now, to make itself felt in intellectual life.  \n5. Deconstruction\n\nThe term \u201cdeconstruction,\u201d like\n\u201cpostmodernism,\u201d has taken on many meanings in the\npopular imagination.  However, in philosophy, it signifies certain\nstrategies for reading and writing texts.  The term was introduced\ninto philosophical literature in 1967, with the publication of three\ntexts by Jacques Derrida: Of Grammatology (in English\n1974), Writing and Difference (in English 1978),\nand Speech and Phenomena (in English 1973). This so-called\n\u201cpublication blitz\u201d immediately established Derrida as a\nmajor figure in the new movement in philosophy and the human sciences\ncentered in Paris, and brought the idiom \u201cdeconstruction\u201d\ninto its vocabulary. Derrida and deconstruction are routinely\nassociated with postmodernism, although like Deleuze and Foucault, he\ndoes not use the term and would resist affiliation with\n\u201c-isms\u201d of any sort. Of the three books from 1967, Of\nGrammatology is the more comprehensive in laying out the\nbackground for deconstruction as a way of reading modern theories of\nlanguage, especially structuralism, and Heidegger's meditations on\nthe non-presence of being. It also sets out Derrida's difference with\nHeidegger over Nietzsche. Where Heidegger places Nietzsche within the\nmetaphysics of presence, Derrida insists that \u201creading, and\ntherefore writing, the text were for Nietzsche\n\u2018originary\u2019 operations,\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 19),\nand this puts him at the closure of metaphysics (not the end), a\nclosure that liberates writing from the traditional logos, which\ntakes writing to be a sign (a visible mark) for another sign\n(speech), whose \u201csignified\u201d is a fully present\nmeaning.\n\nThis closure has emerged, says Derrida, with the latest developments\nin linguistics, the human sciences, mathematics, and cybernetics,\nwhere the written mark or signifier is purely technical, that is, a\nmatter of function rather than meaning. Precisely the liberation of\nfunction over meaning indicates that the epoch of what Heidegger\ncalls the metaphysics of presence has come to closure, although this\nclosure does not mean its termination.  Just as in the essay\n\u201cOn the Question of Being\u201d (Heidegger 1998, 291-322)\nHeidegger sees fit to cross out the word \u201cbeing,\u201d leaving\nit visible, nevertheless, under the mark, Derrida takes the closure\nof metaphysics to be its \u201cerasure,\u201d where it does not\nentirely disappear, but remains inscribed as one side of a\ndifference, and where the mark of deletion is itself a trace of the\ndifference that joins and separates this mark and what it crosses\nout. Derrida calls this joining and separating of\nsigns diff\u00e9rance (Derrida 1974 [1967], 23), a device\nthat can only be read and not heard when diff\u00e9rance\nand diff\u00e9rence are pronounced in French. The\n\u201ca\u201d is a written mark that differentiates independently\nof the voice, the privileged medium of metaphysics. In this\nsense, diff\u00e9rance as the spacing of difference, as\narchi-writing, would be the gram of grammatology. However,\nas Derrida remarks: \u201cThere cannot be a science of difference\nitself in its operation, as it is impossible to have a science of the\norigin of presence itself, that is to say of a certain\nnon-origin\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 63). Instead, there is only\nthe marking of the trace of difference, that is, deconstruction.\n Because at its functional level all language is a system of\ndifferences, says Derrida, all language, even when spoken, is writing,\nand this truth is suppressed when meaning is taken as an origin,\npresent and complete unto itself. Texts that take meaning or being as\ntheir theme are therefore particularly susceptible to deconstruction,\nas are all other texts insofar as they are conjoined with these. For\nDerrida, written marks or signifiers do not arrange themselves within\nnatural limits, but form chains of signification that radiate in all\ndirections. As Derrida famously remarks, \u201cthere is no\noutside-text\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 158), that is, the text\nincludes the difference between any \u201cinside\u201d or\n\u201coutside.\u201d As he explains in a letter to Gerald Graff,\nattached as an appendix to Limited Inc (see Derrida 1988, 148),\nthis means that \u201cevery referent, all reality has the structure\nof a differential trace.\u201d A text, then, is not a book, and does\nnot, strictly speaking, have an author. On the contrary, the name of\nthe author is a signifier linked with others, and there is no master\nsignifier (such as the phallus in Lacan) present or even absent in a\ntext. This goes for the term \u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d\nas well, which can only serve as a supplement for the productive\nspacing between signs. Therefore, Derrida insists that\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance is literally neither a word nor a\nconcept\u201d (Derrida 1982 [1972], 3). Instead, it can only be\nmarked as a wandering play of differences that is both a spacing of\nsignifiers in relation to one another and a deferral of meaning or\npresence when they are read.\n\nHow, then, can diff\u00e9rance be characterized? Derrida\nrefuses to answer questions as to \u201cwho\u201d or\n\u201cwhat\u201d differs, because to do so would suggest there is a\nproper name for difference instead of endless supplements, of which\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d is but one. Structurally,\nthis supplemental displacement functions just as, for Heidegger, all\nnames for being reduce being to the presence of beings, thus ignoring\nthe \u201contological difference\u201d between them.  However,\nDerrida takes the ontological difference as one difference among\nothers, as a product of what the idiom\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d supplements. As he remarks:\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance, in a certain and very strange way,\n(is) \u2018older\u2019 than the ontological difference or than the\ntruth of Being\u201d (Derrida 1982 [1972], 22). Deconstruction,\nthen, traces the repetitions of the supplement. It is not so much a\ntheory about texts as a practice of reading and transforming texts,\nwhere tracing the movements of diff\u00e9rance produces\nother texts interwoven with the first. While there is a certain\narbitrariness in the play of differences that result, it is not the\narbitrariness of a reader getting the text to mean whatever he or she\nwants. It is a question of function rather than meaning, if meaning\nis understood as a terminal presence, and the signifying connections\ntraced in deconstruction are first offered by the text itself. A\ndeconstructive reading, then, does not assert or impose meaning, but\nmarks out places where the function of the text works against its\napparent meaning, or against the history of its interpretation.\n6. Hyperreality\n Hyperreality is closely related to the concept of the simulacrum:\na copy or image without reference to an original.  In postmodernism,\nhyperreality is the result of the technological mediation of\nexperience, where what passes for reality is a network of images and\nsigns without an external referent, such that what is represented is\nrepresentation itself. In Symbolic Exchange and Death (1976),\nJean Baudrillard uses Lacan's concepts of the symbolic, the imaginary,\nand the real to develop this concept while attacking orthodoxies of\nthe political Left, beginning with the assumed reality of power,\nproduction, desire, society, and political legitimacy. Baudrillard\nargues that all of these realities have become simulations, that\nis, signs without any referent, because the real and the\nimaginary have been absorbed into the symbolic.\n\nBaudrillard presents hyperreality as the terminal stage of\nsimulation, where a sign or image has no relation to any reality\nwhatsoever, but is \u201cits own pure simulacrum\u201d (Baudrillard\n1981, 6). The real, he says, has become an operational effect of\nsymbolic processes, just as images are technologically generated and\ncoded before we actually perceive them. This means technological\nmediation has usurped the productive role of the Kantian subject, the\nlocus of an original synthesis of concepts and intuitions, as well as\nthe Marxian worker, the producer of capital though labor, and the\nFreudian unconscious, the mechanism of repression and\ndesire. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d says Baudrillard, \u201csigns are\nexchanged against each other rather than against the real\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 7), so production now means signs producing other\nsigns. The system of symbolic exchange is therefore no longer real\nbut \u201chyperreal.\u201d Where the real is \u201cthat of\nwhich it is possible to provide an equivalent\nreproduction,\u201d the hyperreal, says Baudrillard, is\n\u201cthat which is always already reproduced\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 73). The hyperreal is a system of simulation\nsimulating itself.\n\nThe lesson Baudrillard draws from the events of May 1968 is that the\nstudent movement was provoked by the realization that \u201cwe\nwere no longer productive\u201d (Baudrillard 1976, 29), and\nthat direct opposition within the system of communication and\nexchange only reproduces the mechanisms of the system\nitself. Strategically, he says, capital can only be defeated by\nintroducing something inexchangeable into the symbolic order, that\nis, something having the irreversible function of natural death,\nwhich the symbolic order excludes and renders invisible. The system,\nhe points out, simulates natural death with fascinating images of\nviolent death and catastrophe, where death is the result of\nartificial processes and \u201caccidents.\u201d But, as Baudrillard\nremarks: \u201cOnly the death-function cannot be programmed and\nlocalized\u201d (Baudrillard 1976, 126), and by this he means death\nas the simple and irreversible finality of life. Therefore he calls\nfor the development of \u201cfatal strategies\u201d to make the\nsystem suffer reversal and collapse.\n\nBecause these strategies must be carried out within the symbolic\norder, they are matters of rhetoric and art, or a hybrid of\nboth. They also function as gifts or sacrifices, for which the system\nhas no counter-move or equivalence. Baudrillard finds a prime example\nof this strategy with graffiti artists who experiment with symbolic\nmarkings and codes in order to suggest communication while blocking\nit, and who sign their inscriptions with pseudonyms instead of\nrecognizable names. \u201cThey are seeking not to escape the\ncombinatory in order to regain an identity,\u201d says Baudrillard,\n\u201cbut to turn indeterminacy against the system, to\nturn indeterminacy into extermination\u201d\n(Baudrillard 1976, 78). Some of his own remarks, such as \u201cI\nhave nothing to do with postmodernism,\u201d have, no doubt, the\nsame strategic intent.  To the extent that\n\u201cpostmodernism\u201d has become a sign exchangeable for other\nsigns, he would indeed want nothing to do with it. Nevertheless, his\nconcepts of simulation and hyperreality, and his call for strategic\nexperimentation with signs and codes, bring him into close proximity\nwith figures such as Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida.\n7. Postmodern Hermeneutics\n Hermeneutics, the science of textual interpretation, also plays a\nrole in postmodern philosophy.  Unlike deconstruction, which focuses\nupon the functional structures of a text, hermeneutics seeks to arrive\nat an agreement or consensus as to what the text means, or is about.\nGianni Vattimo formulates a postmodern hermeneutics in The End of\nModernity (1985, in English 1988 [1985]), where he distinguishes\nhimself from his Parisian counterparts by posing the question of\npost-modernity as a matter for ontological hermeneutics. Instead of\ncalling for experimentation with counter-strategies and functional\nstructures, he sees the heterogeneity and diversity in our experience\nof the world as a hermeneutical problem to be solved by developing a\nsense continuity between the present and the past. This continuity is\nto be a unity of meaning rather than the repetition of a functional\nstructure, and the meaning is ontological. In this respect, Vattimo's\nproject is an extension of Heidegger's inquiries into the meaning of\nbeing. However, where Heidegger situates Nietzsche within the limits\nof metaphysics, Vattimo joins Heidegger's ontological hermeneutics\nwith Nietzsche's attempt to think beyond nihilism and historicism with\nhis concept of eternal return. The result, says Vattimo, is a certain\ndistortion of Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche, allowing Heidegger and\nNietzsche to be interpreted through one another (Vattimo 1988 [1985],\n176). This is a significant point of difference between Vattimo and\nthe French postmodernists, who read Nietzsche against Heidegger, and\nprefer Nietzsche's textual strategies over Heidegger's pursuit of the\nmeaning of being.\n\nOn Vattimo's account, Nietzsche and Heidegger can be brought together\nunder the common theme of overcoming. Where Nietzsche announces the\novercoming of nihilism through the active nihilism of the eternal\nreturn, Heidegger proposes to overcome metaphysics through a\nnon-metaphysical experience of being. In both cases, he argues, what\nis to be overcome is modernity, characterized by the image that\nphilosophy and science are progressive developments in which thought\nand knowledge increasingly appropriate their own origins and\nfoundations. Overcoming modernity, however, cannot mean progressing\ninto a new historical phase. As Vattimo observes: \u201cBoth\nphilosophers find themselves obliged, on the one hand, to take up a\ncritical distance from Western thought insofar as it is foundational;\non the other hand, however, they find themselves unable to criticize\nWestern thought in the name of another, and truer, foundation\u201d\n(Vattimo 1988 [1985], 2). Overcoming modernity must therefore mean\na Verwindung, in the sense of twisting or distorting\nmodernity itself, rather than an \u00dcberwindung or\nprogression beyond it.\n\nWhile Vattimo takes post-modernity as a new turn in modernity, it\nentails the dissolution of the category of the new in the historical\nsense, which means the end of universal history. \u201cWhile the\nnotion of historicity has become ever more problematic for\ntheory,\u201d he says, \u201cat the same time for historiography\nand its own methodological self-awareness the idea of history as a\nunitary process is rapidly dissolving\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985],\n6). This does not mean historical change ceases to occur, but that\nits unitary development is no longer conceivable, so only local\nhistories are possible. The de-historicization of experience has been\naccelerated by technology, especially television, says Vattimo, so\nthat \u201ceverything tends to flatten out at the level of\ncontemporaneity and simultaneity\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 10). As\na result, we no longer experience a strong sense of teleology in\nworldly events, but, instead, we are confronted with a manifold of\ndifferences and partial teleologies that can only be judged\naesthetically. The truth of postmodern experience is therefore best\nrealized in art and rhetoric.\n\nThe Nietzschean sense of overcoming modernity is \u201cto dissolve\nmodernity through a radicalization of its own innate\ntendencies,\u201d says Vattimo (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 166). These\ninclude the production of \u201cthe new\u201d as a value and the\ndrive for critical overcoming in the sense of appropriating\nfoundations and origins. In this respect, however, Nietzsche shows\nthat modernity results in nihilism: all values, including\n\u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cthe new,\u201d collapse under\ncritical appropriation. The way out of this collapse is the moment of\neternal recurrence, when we affirm the necessity of error in the\nabsence of foundations. Vattimo also finds this new attitude toward\nmodernity in Heidegger's sense of overcoming metaphysics, insofar as\nhe suggests that overcoming the enframing lies with the possibility\nof a turn within the enframing itself. Such a turn would mean\ndeepening and distorting the technological essence, not destroying it\nor leaving it behind. Furthermore, this would be the meaning of\nbeing, understood as the history of interpretation (as\n\u201cweak\u201d being) instead of a grounding truth, and the\nhermeneutics of being would be a distorted historicism. Unlike\ntraditional hermeneutics, Vattimo argues that reconstructing the\ncontinuity of contemporary experience cannot be accomplished without\nunifying art and rhetoric with information from the sciences, and\nthis requires philosophy \u201cto propose a \u2018rhetorically\npersuasive\u2019, unified view of the world, which includes in\nitself traces, residues, or isolated elements of scientific\nknowledge\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 179). Vattimo's philosophy is\ntherefore the project of a postmodern hermeneutics, in contrast to\nthe Parisian thinkers who do not concern themselves with meaning or\nhistory as continuous unities.\n8. Postmodern Rhetoric and Aesthetics\n Rhetoric and aesthetics pertain to the sharing of experience\nthrough activities of participation and imitation.  In the postmodern\nsense, such activities involve sharing or participating in differences\nthat have opened between the old and the new, the natural and the\nartificial, or even between life and death.  The leading exponent of\nthis line of postmodern thought is Mario Perniola. Like Vattimo,\nPerniola insists that postmodern philosophy must not break with the\nlegacies of modernity in science and politics. As he says\nin Enigmas, \u201cthe relationship between thought and\nreality that the Enlightenment, idealism, and Marxism have embodied\nmust not be broken\u201d (Perniola 1995, 43). However, he does not\nbase this continuity upon an internal essence, spirit, or meaning, but\nupon the continuing effects of modernity in the world. One such\neffect, visible in art and in the relation between art and society, is\nthe collapse of the past and future into the present, which he\ncharacterizes as \u201cEgyptian\u201d or \u201cbaroque\u201d in\nnature. This temporal effect is accomplished through the collapse of\nthe difference between humans and things, where \u201chumans are\nbecoming more similar to things, and equally, the inorganic world,\nthanks to electronic technology, seems to be taking over the human\nrole in the perception of events\u201d (Perniola\n1995, viii). This amounts to a kind of\n\u201cEgyptianism,\u201d as described by Hegel in\nhis Aesthetics (see Hegel 1823\u20139, 347-361), where the\nspiritual and the natural are mixed to such a degree that they cannot\nbe separated, as, for example, in the figure of the Sphinx.  However,\nin the postmodern world the inorganic is not natural, but already\nartificial, insofar as our perceptions are mediated by technological\noperations. \n\nLikewise, says Perniola, art collections in modern museums produce a\n\u201cbaroque effect,\u201d where \u201cThe field that is opened\nup by a collection is not that of cultivated public opinion, nor of\nsocial participation, but a space that attracts precisely because it\ncannot be controlled or possessed\u201d (Perniola 1995, 87). That\nis, in the collection, art is removed from its natural or historical\ncontext and creates a new sense of space and time, not reducible to\nlinear history or any sense of origin. The collection, then, is\nemblematic of postmodern society, a moment of its\n\u201ctruth.\u201d Furthermore, Perniola insists that baroque\nsensibility is characteristic of Italian society and culture in\ngeneral. \u201cThe very idea of truth as something essentially\nnaked,\u201d he says, \u201cis at loggerheads with the Baroque\nidea, so firmly rooted in Italy, that truth is something essentially\nclothed\u201d (Perniola 1995, 145). This corresponds to a\nsensibility that is intermediate between internal feelings and\nexternal things. \u201cThe Italian enigma,\u201d he says,\n\u201clies in the fact that the human component is equipped with an\nexternal emotionality that does not belong to him or her intimately,\nbut in which they nonetheless participate\u201d (Perniola 1995,\n145). To account for this enigmatic experience, the philosopher must\nbecome \u201cthe intermediary, the passage, the transit to something\ndifferent and foreign\u201d (Perniola 1995, 40). Hence,\nphilosophical reading and writing are not activities of an identical\nsubject, but processes of mediation and indeterminacy between self\nand other, and philosophical narrative is an overcoming of their\ndifferences.\n\nThese differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by\ncanceling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or\ndefaced in the course of traversing them. In Ritual\nThinking, Perniola illustrates this process through the concepts\nof transit, the simulacrum, and ritual without myth. Transit derives\nfrom a sense of the simultaneity of the present, where we are\nsuspended in a state of temporariness and indeterminacy, and move\n\u201cfrom the same to the same\u201d; the simulacrum is the result\nof an endless mimesis in which there are only copies of copies\nwithout reference to an original; and ritual without myth is the\nrepetition of patterns of action having no connection to the inner\nlife of a subject or of society. Thus Perniola sees social and\npolitical interaction as repetitive patterns of action having no\ninherent meaning but constituting, nonetheless, an intermediary realm\nwhere oppositions, particularly life and death, are overcome in a\nto-and-fro movement within their space of difference. \n\nTo illustrate these concepts Perniola refers to practices associated\nwith Romanism, particularly Roman religion. \u201cRitual without\nmyth,\u201d he says, \u201cis the very essence of Romanism\u201d\n(Perniola 2001, 81). It is a passage between life and death via their\nmutual simulation, for example, in the labyrinthine movements of the\nritual known as the troiae lusus. These movements, he says,\nmediate between life and death by reversing their pattern of natural\nsuccession, and mediate their difference through actions having no\nintrinsic meaning. Unlike Vattimo's project of constructing meaning\nto overcome historical differences, Perniola's concept of transit\ninto the space of difference is one of \u201cart\u201d in the sense\nof artifice or technique, and is not aimed at a synthesis or\nunification of opposing elements. In this respect, Perniola has an\naffinity with the French postmodernists, who emphasize functional\nrepetition over the creation of meaning. However, as Perniola's\nnotion of ritual without myth illustrates, the functional repetitions\nof social interaction and technology do not disseminate differences,\nbut efface them. This is clear in his account of the ritualized\npassage between life and death, as compared with Baudrillard, who\ncalls for strategies introducing the irreversibility of death into\nthe system of symbolic exchange. In this respect, Perniola's\npostmodernism is strongly aesthetic, and remains, with Vattimo, in\nthe aesthetic and historical dimensions of experience.\n9. Habermas's Critique\n\nThe most prominent and comprehensive critic of philosophical\npostmodernism is J\u00fcrgen Habermas. In The Philosophical\nDiscourse of Modernity (Habermas 1987 [1985]), he confronts\npostmodernism at the level of society and \u201ccommunicative\naction.\u201d He does not defend the concept of the subject,\nconceived as consciousness or an autonomous self, against\npostmodernists' attacks, but defends argumentative reason in\ninter-subjective communication against their experimental,\navant-garde strategies. For example, he claims that Nietzsche,\nHeidegger, Derrida and Foucault commit a performative contradiction\nin their critiques of modernism by employing concepts and methods\nthat only modern reason can provide. He criticizes Nietzsche's\nDionysianism as a compensatory gesture toward the loss of unity in\nWestern culture that, in pre-modern times, was provided by religion.\nNietzsche's sense of a new Dionysus in modern art, moreover, is based\nupon an aesthetic modernism in which art acquires its experimental\npower by separating itself from the values of science and morality, a\nseparation accomplished by the modern Enlightenment, resulting in the\nloss of organic unity Nietzsche seeks to restore via art itself (see\nHabermas 1987 [1985], 81-105). Habermas sees Heidegger and Derrida as\nheirs to this \u201cDionysian messianism.\u201d Heidegger, for\nexample, anticipates a new experience of being, which has\nwithdrawn. However, says Habermas, the withdrawal of being is the\nresult of an inverted philosophy of the subject, where Heidegger's\ndestruction of the subject leads to hope for a unity to come, a unity\nof nothing other than the subject that is now missing (Habermas 1987\n[1985], 160). Derrida, he says, develops the notion\nof diff\u00e9rance or \u201carchi-writing\u201d in\nsimilar fashion: here, we see the god Dionysus revealing himself once\nagain in his absence, as meaning infinitely deferred (Habermas 1987\n[1985], 180-81).\n\nHabermas also criticizes Derrida for leveling the distinction between\nphilosophy and literature in a textualism that brings logic and\nargumentative reason into the domain of rhetoric. In this way, he\nsays, Derrida hopes to avoid the logical problem of self-reference in\nhis critique of reason. However, as Habermas remarks: \u201cWhoever\ntransposes the radical critique of reason into the domain of rhetoric\nin order to blunt the paradox of self-referentiality, also dulls the\nsword of the critique of reason itself\u201d (Habermas 1987 [1985],\n210). In similar fashion, he criticizes Foucault for not subjecting\nhis own genealogical method to genealogical unmasking, which would\nreveal Foucault's re-installation of a modern subject able to\ncritically gaze at its own history. Thus, he says, \u201cFoucault\ncannot adequately deal with the persistent problems that come up in\nconnection with an interpretive approach to the object domain, a\nself-referential denial of universal validity claims, and a normative\njustification of critique\u201d (Habermas 1987 [1985], 286).\n\nHabermas's critique of postmodernism on the basis of performative\ncontradiction and the paradox of self-reference sets the tone and the\nterms for much of the critical debate now under way. While\npostmodernists have rejected these criticisms, or responded to them\nwith rhetorical counter-strategies.  Lyotard, for example, rejects\nthe notion that intersubjective communication implies a set of rules\nalready agreed upon, and that universal consensus is the ultimate\ngoal of discourse (see Lyotard 1984 [1979], 65-66).  That\npostmodernists openly respond to Habermas is due to the fact that he\ntakes postmodernism seriously and does not, like other critics,\nreject it as mere nonsense. Indeed, that he is able to read\npostmodernist texts closely and discursively testifies to their\nintelligibility. He also agrees with the postmodernists that the\nfocus of debate should be upon modernity as it is realized in social\npractices and institutions, rather than upon theories of cognition or\nformal linguistics as autonomous domains. In this respect, Habermas's\nconcern with inter-subjective communication helps clarify the basis\nupon which the modernist-postmodernist debates continue to play\nout. \n",
