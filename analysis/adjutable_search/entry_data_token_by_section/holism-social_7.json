    "main_text": "Why Holist Explanations are Indispensable || The Argument from Pragmatic Concerns\n2.6 The Argument from Pragmatic Concerns\n\nThe argument from pragmatic concerns states that whether holist\nexplanations are indispensable is a matter of whether they are\npragmatically preferable to individualist explanations. The argument\nrests on the assumption that whenever a holist explanation of an event\nis possible, an individualist explanation of that same event is\nlikewise feasible. It is claimed that the choice between these two\nexplanations should be made by appeal to pragmatic considerations. It\nis maintained, moreover, that it is sometimes preferable from a\npragmatic perspective to offer a holist, rather than an individualist\nexplanation. On this basis, it is concluded that holist explanations\nare indispensable.\n\nAn argument along these lines has been offered by Jones (1996). He\nnotes that it is sometimes less costly to establish a holist rather\nthan an individualist explanation of some event (1996: 126). What he\nlikely has in mind is that gathering evidence about individuals, their\ndoings, intentions, etc. with the aim of offering an individualist\nexplanation may take more time, and hence come with a higher monetary\ncost, than producing the evidence needed to advance a holist\nexplanation. Jones additionally asserts that a holist explanation is\nsometimes easier to teach: because holist explanations tend to be\nsimpler in that they do not include an abundance of detail about\nindividuals, their doings, beliefs, etc. (1996), they may be easier\nfor individuals to grasp. In these sorts of situations, Jones contends\nthat holist explanations are preferable to individualist ones: in view\nof pragmatic concerns like those outlined above, holist explanations\nare indispensable.\n",
