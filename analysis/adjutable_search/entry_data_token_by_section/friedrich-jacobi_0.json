    "main_text": "Life and Intellectual Career\n1. Life and Intellectual Career\n\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi\u2019s life spanned an era of great\nintellectual ferment in Germany. He witnessed or was engaged with some\nof the most significant cultural developments, if not revolutions,\nthat the modern Western world experienced. His family did not lead him\nto take up intellectual life, as was the case for his older brother,\nthe poet Johann Georg (1740\u20131814), Jacobi nonetheless arrived on\nthe central stage of the philosophical world thanks to his criticism\nof the German Enlightenment and, perhaps primarily, for his work on\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy. His analysis of Spinoza\u2019s\n\u2018Ethics\u2019 was the main topic of his first philosophical\npublication in 1785, and it made Spinoza a necessary point of\nreference in the assessment of rationality as such. This factor,\ntogether with his investigation of fundamental inconsistencies in\nKant\u2019s transcendental philosophy, made Jacobi into one of the\nforefathers of the far\u2013reaching turn in the history of thinking\nnow known as Classical German Philosophy.\n\nWhile also writing political commentary, Jacobi held official\npositions in few governing bodies, in the course of such work he\nworked toward a more liberal administration of taxation. He married\nHelene Elisabeth (Betty) von Clermont, a noblewoman, and together they\nestablished a literary circle in Pempelfort, hosting some of the\ngreatest minds of the age.\n\nJacobi was born in D\u00fcsseldorf on January 25, 1743, in the family\nof a prosperous merchant. He was intended to carry on his\nfather\u2019s business, and he was sent to a Frankfurt commercial\nhouse for apprenticeship. This, however, merely revealed his true\nvocation for a literary career, leading to his moving to Geneva (1759)\nto study under Georges\u2013Louis Le Sage. Le Sage exposed him to the\nEnlightenment in the shape of the French Encyclopedists, as well as to\nCharles de Bonnet\u2019s psychology: later, Jacobi\u2019s vast\nlibrary included a copy of the \u2018Essai analytique sur les\nfacult\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e2me\u2019. Together with\nBonnet\u2019s thinking, Jacobi encountered new ideas, from Voltaire\nto Rousseau, that developed from eighteenth century rationalism the\ncradle of lay criticism. In 1762 Jacobi returned to D\u00fcsseldorf,\nmarried, and took charge of his father\u2019s trading house, but only\nuntil 1772, when he took up a position in the administration of\nJ\u00fclich and Berg. During this period, essays by Mendelssohn and\nKant, submitted to a competition hosted by the Berlin Academy, caught\nhis attention, as he later confirmed in his \u2018David Hume\nDialogue\u2019: they had a long\u2013lasting influence on his\ninterpretation of scientific reasoning and metaphysics (Pistilli\n2007). Jacobi then began what became an extensive correspondence with\nthe thinkers of his age. If the salon that he hosted with his wife was\nan outer sign of his literary ambitions, the number and notoriety of\nthose he corresponded with, from Johann Gottlieb Fichte to Friedrich\nGottlieb Klopstock and from Immanuel Kant to F.D.E. Schleiermacher,\nconfirmed the range of his intellectual facility.\n\nIn 1772, with Christoph Martin Wieland, Jacobi drafted a project to\nlaunch a journal, the Teutcher Merkur, inspired by the French\ngazette Mercure de France. Wieland began as editor of the\npublication in 1773, and Jacobi used it to publish some of his\noccasional writings. More important than his relationship with Wieland\nwas his interactions with Goethe in 1774 (Heinz, 1965). That encounter\ncatalyzed Jacobi\u2019s next efforts, \u2018Eduard Allwills\nPapiere\u2019 (1775/6) and \u2018Woldemar. Eine Seltenheit aus der\nNaturgeschichte\u2019 (1777/9) (Prantl, 1881: 579). These works were\nto become paradigmatic instances of Jacobi\u2019s philosophical\nnovels, forming a reaction to the prevalent style of Sturm und\nDrang. Jacobi\u2019s fresh and inspiring friendship with Goethe\ndid not last long, however. Goethe\u2019s reaction to the\n\u2018Woldemar\u2019 was a bitter eye\u2013opener for Jacobi:\nGoethe enacted a crucifixion of the book on a tree in 1779 (di\nGiovanni, 1994: 52\u201353). In 1779, Jacobi left for Munich to\naccept an appointment at a government office but then resigned the\nsame year due to the pressure of the controversies aroused by his\nliberal reform proposals, following from his support for Adam\nSmith\u2019s doctrines, as shown in his publications.\n\nThe next decade proved decisive for Jacobi. In 1780, he met Lessing in\nWolfenb\u00fcttel. During their conversations Lessing supposedly\nconfessed his Spinozism. When Lessing died in 1781, M. Mendelssohn\nbegan drafting a laudatory portrait of this great champion of the\nGerman Enlightenment. Jacobi felt obliged to inform Mendelssohn of\nLessing\u2019s true philosophical tendency, but Jacobi\u2019s report\nshocked Mendelssohn: being a Spinozist entailed being an atheist and a\nsubversive who disregarded all morality and religion. Mendelssohn\nengaged with Jacobi to assess Lessing\u2019s Spinozism and, more\nimportantly, Spinoza\u2019s own teaching. This exchange between the\ntwo began in 1783 and eventually provided the basis of Jacobi\u2019s\n1785 famous volume \u2018\u00dcber die Lehre des Spinoza in Briefen\nan den Herrn Moses Mendelssohn\u2019. In addition to\nMendelssohn\u2019s response of 1786, to which Jacobi replied the same\nyear, the extent and acrimony of the debate that Jacobi aroused led\nthis work to be a milestone in the prehistory of Classical German\nPhilosophy. Jacobi\u2019s controversy with Mendelssohn led to an\nunearthing of the peculiar humanism and the distinct rationality that\nwere part of the vision of the Enlightenment, to which Jacobi proposed\na reasoned rejection, uncovering its Spinozian hidden soul. The\nso-called Spinozarenaissance that followed this public\nexchange between Jacobi and Mendelssohn made Spinoza\u2019s\n\u2018Ethica, ordine geometrico demonstrata\u2019 a touchstone for\nany philosophical system to come (Jaeschke and Sandkaulen, 2004). At\nthe same time, Spinoza\u2019s renaissance fostered the so-called\nSpinoza controversy, or that of Pantheismusstreit, which\nignited passionate disputes around the nature of freedom, the reality\nof final causes, and the actual existence of individual entities. For\nJacobi, finding a route through Spinoza\u2019s philosophy was the\nbest opportunity to thoroughly discuss the essence of rationalism,\nwhich dismisses free human actions and puts in their place the pure\natheistic fatalism that a coherent system of knowledge implies.\n\nAs Goethe stressed, this controversy touched everyone in their deepest\nconvictions. Only two years after the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019,\nJacobi published another book, \u2018David Hume \u00fcber den\nGlauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus. Ein Gespr\u00e4ch\u2019. Its\nmain purpose was to shake off the traces of irrationalism that he was\naccused of due to his use of the term Glaube (faith) in the\n\u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019 (Jacobi, (1994 (2): 255 and JWA 2,1:\n 9)[1].\n Jacobi confirmed that his notion of faith was reminiscent of the role\nthat this concept played in Hume\u2019s philosophy, though he\nrejected the latter\u2019s skepticism. Jacobi\u2019s realism was in\nfact tempered by a different interpretation of the pillars of human\nknowledge, which allowed him to challenge the problematic positing of\nthe Ding an sich in Kant\u2019s transcendental philosophy.\nHis dictum that \u2018Without that presupposition [of the thing in\nitself], I could not enter into [Kant\u2019s] system, but with it I\ncould not stay within it\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 336 and JWA 2,1:\n109) became a well\u2013known summary of a diagnosis that concerned\nboth Kant\u2019s idealism as well as many of its heirs. Not least of\nthese was Fichte\u2019s \u2018Wissenschaftslehre\u2019 (Jacobi,\n1994 (2): 501 and JWA 2,1: 194).\n\nIn 1789, Jacobi published a second, augmented edition of the\n\u2019Spinoza Briefen\u2019, putting forth a solution to the\ndichotomy between nature and freedom (Sandkaulen, 2000: 64ff). The\nadditions marked Jacobi\u2019s explicit opposition to Kant\u2019s\nrecently published \u2018Critique of Practical Reason\u2019, but\nthey also helped announce the main topic of the last decade of\neighteenth century: freedom.\n\nAs the French troops marched toward D\u00fcsseldorf in 1794, Jacobi\nfled his home and moved to safer locations, which included Hamburg and\nHolstein. Eventually he settled in Eutin (1798). During this period,\nJacobi began to draft what later became \u2018Von den g\u00f6ttlichen\nDingen und ihrer Offenbarung\u2019, which was only published in 1811.\nWhile in Eutin, he still did not experience peace, at least so far as\nhis intellectual output was concerned. Jacobi had become involved in\nthe dispute over Fichte\u2019s alleged atheism, the so\u2013called\nAtheismusstreit. His famous letter \u2018Jacobi an\nFichte\u2019 was written to clear Fichte of the accusation of\natheism: Fichte\u2019s \u2018Wissenschaftslehre\u2019 was no more\natheistic than geometry or arithmetic. Instead, it was nihilistic\n(Jacobi, 1994 (2): 519 and JWA 2,1: 215). In Jacobi\u2019s eyes,\nFichte\u2019s philosophy was simply Spinozism but based upon\nsubjectivity: the systematic operation that Spinoza\u2019s substance\nperforms is achieved by Fichte\u2019s doctrine of science and shows\nhow the necessary connection between singular entities is achieved by\nthe activity of the absolute (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 502 and JWA 2,1: 195).\nThus, all existing actuality (in ethics as much as in epistemology)\nmust be considered the manifestation of a rational universality that\nFichte called \u2018the absolute I\u2019. By contrast with this\nwidespread understanding of rationality, Jacobi re\u2013drafted his\nown notion of Vernunft. Initially, Jacobi was critical of the\nidea of reason (e.g., Jacobi, 1994 (2): 230 and JWA 1,1: 115) due to\nthe terminological legacy advanced by the philosophical systems that\nhe was battling against. He moved slowly toward a different, more\nrefined understanding of the term, which bears traces of\nJacobi\u2019s own theoretical evolution. This first appears in the\nsecond edition of the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994 (2):\n375 and JWA 1,1: 259\u2013260). The second supplement to \u2018Jacobi an\nFichte\u2019 shows further evidence of this evolution (Jacobi, 1994\n(2): 529 and JWA 2,1: 229), as Jacobi\u2019s 1802 publication\n\u2018\u00dcber das Unternehmen des Kriticismus, die Vernunft zu\nVerstande zu bringen, und der Philosophie \u00fcberhaupt eine neue\nAbsicht zu geben\u2019 does.\n\nIn 1805, Jacobi moved to Munich to join the newly established\nBayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, becoming its\npresident in 1807. Alerted by Schelling\u2019s early writings, Jacobi\nhad sensed an unequivocal Spinozian naturalism in his speech entitled\n\u2018\u00dcber das Verh\u00e4ltnis der bildenden K\u00fcnste zur\nNatur\u2019, given at the Akademie der Wissenschaften on the\nking\u2019s name day, October 10, 1807. His suspicion was confirmed\nby Schelling\u2019s essay on human freedom (1809), reading which gave\nJacobi the impulse to finish his \u2018Von den g\u00f6ttlichen Dingen\nund ihrer Offenbarung\u2019. With this last book, Jacobi sought to\nshow that an unprecedented effort to reject the existence and\nrationality of human beings\u2019 free activity animated Spinoza,\nKant, Fichte, and the youngest (\u2018second\u2019) daughter of\ntranscendental thinking (as he referred to Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy). As had happened with the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019\nand the \u2018Jacobi an Fichte\u2019, the \u2018Von den\ng\u00f6ttlichen Dingen\u2019 became the center of a dispute. This\nthird debate of the post\u2013Kantian era, the so\u2013called\nTheimusstreit, broke out only to provide Jacobi with a\nsuitable spotlight to shine on his conclusive definitions of\nrationality and God. In a sense, he here disclosed his philosophical\ntestament. He was forced to resign from his position at the\nAkademie in 1812. As a retired but still prominent cultural\npersonality, Jacobi worked until his death at editing of his Collected\nWorks, assisted by his disciples J.F. K\u00f6ppen and C.J.F. Roth.\n\nAfter receiving Hegel\u2019s positive review of the third volume of\nhis Collected Works (Jacobi, 1825\u201327: vol. 2, 467\u201368), Jacobi\nregretted being too old to study Hegel\u2019s thought; he was\nconvinced that Hegel had finally grasped his philosophy, at least\nbetter than he had at the time of \u2018Glauben und\nWissen\u2019.\n\nHe died in Munich on March 10, 1819.\n",
