    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhen is political authority legitimate?  This is one of the\nfundamental questions of political philosophy.  Depending on how one\nunderstands political authority this question may be the same as, when\nis coercion by the state legitimate?  Or, when do we have duties to\nobey the state?  Or, when and who has a right to rule through the\nstate? \nThis entry is concerned with the philosophical issues that arise in\nthe justification of political authority.  First, this entry will\nexamine some of the main conceptual issues that arise relating to\npolitical authority.  What do we mean by political authority?  This\nentry distinguishes political authority from political power, and the\nidea of morally legitimate political authority from descriptive ideas\nof authority.  It also distinguishes between authority in the sense of\nmorally justified coercion and authority in the sense of capacity to\nimpose duties on others and finally from authority as right to rule.\nFurther distinctions concern the nature of the duties that political\nauthority imposes on subjects. \nThe main part of the entry (section\n 4) \n concerns the nature and merits of different accounts of the\nlegitimacy of political authority.  Under what conditions is political\nauthority legitimate?  This entry discusses five different views of\nthe legitimacy of political authority.  It discusses the\ninstrumentalist theory according to which authority is legitimate to\nthe extent that it gets people to do what they already have a duty to\ndo.  It discusses the consent theory of authority according to which\nauthority is legitimate only if the subjects have consented to it.  It\ndiscusses the theory advanced by John Rawls that authority is\nlegitimate if and only if it acts in accord with principles the\nsubjects agree to.  It discusses Ronald Dworkin's view according to\nwhich legitimate political authority is akin to the basis of\nobligations to friendships, families and other associations.  Finally\nit discusses the democratic conception of authority according to which\nthe democratic assembly has legitimate political authority within\ncertains limits because it treats every citizen as an equal in the\nprocess of making law.\n",
