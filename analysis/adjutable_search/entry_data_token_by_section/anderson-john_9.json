    "main_text": "Specific Fields || Education\n5.6 Education\n\nIn the 1950s, Anderson retreated from broad political theory which had\nbeen a feature of his lectures and writings of the 1940s, and attended\nmore to local and institutional questions. This new emphasis emerged\nin his lectures on education and on criticism. Central to\nAnderson\u2019s view of education is the rejection of any utilitarian\nor instrumental view of education, the view of education as a means to\nsome other purpose. Education needs to be understood as an activity\nwith positive characteristics of its own. Education is critical,\ndevoted to developing and discarding hypotheses, to seeing through\npretensions of all kinds. It means for the individual \u201cfinding a\nway of life\u201d and it affects the whole life of the educated\nindividual. Critical intellectual life survives as a social tradition,\na \u201cmovement\u201d to which individuals are attracted and in\nwhich they are caught up.\n\nAnderson\u2019s classicism promotes the history of European culture\nfrom the early Greeks as a tradition of critical thought that can\nrefresh and fortify contemporary education against the predations of\npracticalism and servility in the modern world. Education is concerned\nwith training in taste and judgement. The educated individual is not\nshackled by the assumptions of his society or group\n(JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of Spencer\nand Dewey, 1949). But to play its part, education must resist outside\nstandards (such as those set by the attitudes and capacities of\ncommercial society, or by the vocational needs of business) as to what\nis to be allowed and valued in institutions of education. Rhees\nsuggested that Anderson was primarily concerned with a \u201cgrammar\nschool education\u201d, one not suited to the \u201cmasses\u201d\n(Rhees 1969 p. 168). In particular, for Anderson, vocational and\nmoralistic standards have to be resisted. True learning is not easy\nand cannot be made easy \u2013 it advances only through overcoming\nresistances. The inquiring life has to stand up for itself. It is just\nas real, just as practical, just as positive a part of society as\nother activities (J. L. Mackie, in EAI).\n\nAny activity or institution of learning can proceed only along the\nlines of certain traditions with custodians and in terms of common\nactivities (JAA, Lectures on Greek Theories of\nEducation, 1954). For education is simply one struggling tendency in\nsociety itself among others \u2013 even within institutions\nsupposedly devoted to educational aims, true educational values have\nto be fought for. \n\nAnderson\u2019s lectures on education are of interest because they\ninclude the most extensive account of his appreciation for the\nclassicism of Matthew Arnold, but more particularly of his attitude\ntowards the philosophy of John Dewey. Besides his early\nacknowledgement of the importance of William James (at least the more\nmetaphysical writings on radical empiricism) and his critical articles\non F. C. S. Schiller, the consideration of Dewey\u2019s educational\ntheory is the most important reflection on American pragmatism in\nAnderson\u2019s work. The question of the relation of theory to\npractice was one that exercised Anderson repeatedly. His position was\nthat the connection was a close one, but not in the direction that he\nassumed pragmatism urged. Theory was not dependent upon practice for\nthe validity of its findings. Rather inquiry proceeded from particular\nkinds of practice. Certain forms of life made possible an objective\nview of things. Moreover, theory was not subsidiary to practice in an\ninstrumental sense because it was itself a distinct form of practice\nwith its own requirements and standards. Anderson reflected upon this\nquestion both in the lectures on education but also in his lectures on\nMarxism and most particularly on Marx\u2019s Theses on\nFeuerbach where he was concerned to dispute Sidney Hook\u2019s\npragmatist reading of the theses (JAA, Philosophical\nImplications of Marxism). Both the fact of his consideration of the\nenigmatic Theses and his substantial conclusions on the\nrelation of theory to practice would have resonated with the\nAlthusserian Marxists in the Department of General Philosophy in the\n1970s. \n",
