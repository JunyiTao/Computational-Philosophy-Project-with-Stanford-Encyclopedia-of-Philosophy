    "main_text": "Methodologies of discovery\n8. Methodologies of discovery\n\nAdvocates of the view that there are methodologies of discovery use\nthe term \u201clogic\u201d in the narrow sense of an algorithmic\nprocedure to generate new ideas. But like the AI-based theories of\nscientific discovery described in\n section 6,\n methodologies of scientific discovery interpret the concept\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d as a label for an extended process of\ngenerating and articulating new ideas and often describe the process\nin terms of problem solving. In these approaches, the distinction\nbetween the contexts of discovery and the context of justification is\nchallenged because the methodology of discovery is understood to play\na justificatory role. Advocates of a methodology of discovery usually\nrely on a distinction between different justification procedures,\njustification involved in the process of generating new knowledge and\njustification involved in testing it. Consequential or\n\u201cstrong\u201d justifications are methods of testing. The\njustification involved in discovery, by contrast, is conceived as\ngenerative (as opposed to consequential) justification\n (section 8.1)\n or as weak (as opposed to strong) justification\n (section 8.2).\n Again, some terminological ambiguity exists because according to some\nphilosophers, there are three contexts, not two: Only the initial\nconception of a new idea (the creative act is the context of discovery\nproper, and between it and justification there exists a separate\ncontext of pursuit (Laudan 1980). But many advocates of methodologies\nof discovery regard the context of pursuit as an integral part of the\nprocess of justification. They retain the notion of two contexts and\nre-draw the boundaries between the contexts of discovery and\njustification as they were drawn in the early 20th\ncentury.\n",
