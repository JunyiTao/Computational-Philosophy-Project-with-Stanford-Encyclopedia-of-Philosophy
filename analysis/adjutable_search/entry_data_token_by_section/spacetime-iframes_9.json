    "main_text": "Inertial frames in the 20th century: special and general relativity || Special relativity and Lorentz invariance\n2.3 Special relativity and Lorentz invariance\n\nEinstein solved this difficulty through his analysis of simultaneity:\nframes in relative motion can agree on the velocity of light only if\nthey disagree on simultaneity. Only the relativity of simultaneity\nmakes possible the invariance of the velocity of light. This means\nthat the transformations between inertial frames that preserve the\nvelocity of light will not preserve simultaneity. These are the\nLorentz transformations: \n\n\\[\nx' = \\frac{x-vt}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \\quad y'=y \\quad z'=z \\quad t'=\\frac{t-vx/c^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\n\n\\]\n\n\nEvidently these transformations preserve the velocity of light, but\nthey do not preserve length and time. So the invariant quantities of\nNewtonian mechanics, which presuppose invariant measures of length and\ntime, must now depend on the choice of inertial frame. In other words,\nacceleration is an invariant quantity only when it is zero, for the\nmagnitude of a non-zero acceleration will differ for observers in\nrelative motion. Therefore the notions of force, mass, and\nacceleration no longer provides an appropriate definition of an\ninertial frame, except in the ideal case of a frame in which no forces\nare acting. Einstein\u2019s definition instead appeals to the\ninvariant quantities of electrodynamics: an inertial frame is one in\nwhich light travels equal distances in equal times in arbitrary\ndirections. What seems impossible, from the point of view of Galilean\nrelativity, is that a frame that moves uniformly relative to one frame\nthat satisfies Einstein\u2019s definition should also satisfy the\ndefinition. But that seeming impossibility rests, again, on the\nassumption that two inertial frames will have a common measure of\nsimultaneity. Einstein showed that light-signals provide an\nempirically and theoretically reasonable definition of simultaneity,\nin light of the empirical soundness of Maxwell\u2019s equations and\nthe apparent invariance of the velocity of light. In the absence of an\nempirically reasonable alternative compatible with Galilean\ninvariance, there is no sound criterion of simultaneity that will give\nthe same results in different inertial frames. Of course, it would\nremain true that in a given inertial frame, the motions of free\nparticles would satisfy the requirements of Lange\u2019s definition,\nand particles that move uniformly in one such frame would also move\nuniformly in any other. But such a definition is not a substitute for\nEinstein\u2019s definition, since it must itself presuppose a\ndefinition of simultaneity. Otherwise, its appeal to the measurement\nand comparison of times and distances is without a sound empirical\nbasis. Einstein\u2019s definition places such measurements on an\nempirical basis. Their results, however, will depend on the choice of\nan inertial frame, and will vary systematically according to the\nrelative velocities of different inertial frames.\n\nThe space-time structure of special relativity thus differs\nessentially from Newtonian space-time, and is called \u201cMinkowski\nspace-time\u201d since Minkowski (1908) first formulated\nEinstein\u2019s theory in its four-dimensional form. It is an affine\nspace, like Newtonian space-time. In both cases, the trajectories of\nfree particles are straight lines of the affine structure, and a set\nof parallel inertial trajectories (geodesics) corresponds to an\ninertial frame. As we just saw, however, Newtonian space-time\npresupposes the invariant division of space-time into\nthree-dimensional hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity, and an\nobjective measure of distance between points at a given moment of\nabsolute time. Minkowski space-time is a four-dimensional vector space\nwith an invariant four-dimensional metrical structure, imposed by the\ninvariance of the speed of light. Instead of an invariant spatial\ninterval between simultaneous events, there is an invariant\nspatio-temporal interval between any two points in space-time. Since\nthere is no invariant relation of simultaneity, the sets of\nsimultaneous events for any inertial frame are the hyperplanes\northogonal to the trajectories that determine that frame. In other\nwords, the choice between two inertial frames determines a choice\nbetween two distinct divisions of space-time into space and time. See\nFigure 8:\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The inertial frames \\(F\\) and\n\\(F'\\) are in relative motion, and therefore, as the Lorentz\ntransformations indicate, they disagree on simultaneity. \\(F\\) and\n\\(F'\\) thus determine distinct decompositions of space-time into\ninstantaneous spaces, \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\), respectively \n\n",
