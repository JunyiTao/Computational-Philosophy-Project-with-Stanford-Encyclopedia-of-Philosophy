    "main_text": "Are There Any Normative Facts At All? \u2013 Error Theory || The Argument from Queerness\n2.2 The Argument from Queerness\n\nNow that we have set aside the question of how to formulate the error\ntheory, we can deal with the most important recent argument for the\ntheory: Mackie\u2019s Argument from Queerness. We won\u2019t attempt\na full scholarly treatment of Mackie\u2019s argument here (though see\nJoyce & Kirchin 2010, as well as \u00a73.2 of the entry on\n moral anti-realism);\n we are more interested in the broad concerns about normativity it\nspawned. The general thought here is that normative facts, if they\nexisted, would be really weird. This is a thought many have\nshared, perhaps inchoately. As we\u2019ll see, it is difficult to\ndetermine how exactly to flesh out the thought. (In what follows,\nwe\u2019ll follow the precedent set by Mackie and use the term\n\u201cqueer\u201d for \u201cweird\u201d.)\n\nThe basic argument runs something like this:\n\n1.\nIf there were moral facts, they would be queer.\n2.\nThere are no queer entities.\n3.\nTherefore, there are no moral facts.\n\n\nAnd, on certain understandings of the queerness involved, the argument\ncan generalize to the normative:\n\n1\u2032.\nIf there were normative facts, they would be queer.\n2.\nThere are no queer entities.\n3\u2032.\nTherefore, there are no normative facts.\n\n\n(It is possible to weaken the argument, claiming only, in place of\n (2),\n that we ought to believe there are no queer entities, or that it is\nnot the case that we should believe there are queer entities, or even\nthat there is strong prima facie reason against belief in\nqueer entities. The conclusions would then, of course, be\nappropriately weakened. We will continue to consider the strong\nversion above, though in the course of the discussion, we touch on\nweaker versions where they become salient.)\n\nSpeaking a little more precisely, if normative facts are queer, it is\nbecause they have some property that is queer, where that they have\nthis property is essential to normative facts. The queerness in\nquestion would be a property of this property of normative facts.\nHence, to support the\n first premise,\n the error theorist needs to establish:\n\nWhat property of normative facts makes them queer. That is, what\nis the first-order property of normative facts that instantiates the\nsecond-order property of being queer? This is presumably the property\nof being normative, but other answers might be given as well.\nWhat exactly the queerness consists in. That is, what is the\nnature of this second-order property that is instantiated by the\nfirst-order property of being normative, or, perhaps, by certain other\nfirst-order properties of normative facts?\n\n\nAnd these issues \u2013 especially the second \u2013 need to be\naddressed in a way that makes the\n second premise\n plausible. We\u2019ll consider these two issues in turn.\n2.2.1 What feature of normativity is queer?\n\nThe first main issue for the argument from queerness that we mentioned\nabove is, what it is about normative facts in virtue of which they are\n(supposedly) queer. There have been a host of different answers to\nthis question.\n\nMackie himself is relatively unclear on this issue. Some take him to\nbe concerned primarily with the motivational commitments of\nmoral discourse \u2013 that moral discourse entails the truth of\nmotivational internalism, (roughly) the view that genuine moral\nbeliefs entail motivation to act in accordance with those beliefs (see\nJoyce 2001: ch. 1). David Brink argues that Mackie is unclear between\ntwo potentially problematic entailments of moral discourse:\nmotivational internalism, and reasons internalism \u2013 the view that\nmoral obligation entails reasons for action (Brink 1984). Jonas Olson\nargues that Mackie actually argues for the queerness of four\ndistinct features of moral discourse: motivational internalism, a\nsui generis epistemic faculty, the supervenience of the moral\non the non-moral, and finally, the irreducible normativity of moral\nfacts (Olson 2014: chs. 5 and 6).\n\nTheoretically, we could mix and match any of these supposedly queer\nfeatures of normativity with any of the views about what queerness\nconsists in. For example, it might be that the problem is that\nnormative beliefs that entail motivation to act would be a fundamental\naddition to our ontology; maybe the problem is that facts that entail\nreasons for action are not parsimonious; maybe the supervenience of\nthe normative on the non-normative is not parsimonious. But as a\nmatter of fact, although no one is utterly clear on the question of\nwhat queerness consists in, the literature has converged on one family\nof answers to the question of what the queer feature of normativity\nis.\n\nPost-Mackie, philosophers who take up the argument from queerness\ngenerally converge on the categoricity or irreducible\nnormativity of reasons as the queer commitment of\nmorality/normativity. Richard Garner (1990) thinks that moral facts\nare queer because they entail \u201cintrinsic imperativeness\u201d.\nJoyce variously describes this feature as the\n\u201cinescapability\u201d (2001: 31), \u201ccategoricity\u201d\n(2001: 37) \u201cpractical clout\u201d (2006: 57\u201358) or\n\u201cpractical oomph\u201d (2006: 60) of moral requirements. In\nearly work (2011), Olson also identifies categorical reasons as the\nqueer commitment of morality, but in later work (2014) says that it is\nmorality\u2019s entailment of irreducibly normative favoring\nrelations that is queer.\n2.2.2 What does queerness consist in?\n\nEven if there were a consensus on what feature of normative facts is\nqueer, there we would still be the question of what exactly the\nqueerness consists in. What it is about this feature that is supposed\nto be objectionable? And what exactly is the objection supposed to be?\nFor instance, what exactly is objectionable about irreducibly\nnormative favoring relations? Not everything irreducible is queer,\npresumably. Further, what exactly is the nature of the objection? What\nis the objection being signaled by calling irreducibly normative\nfavoring relations queer? What exactly is it to be queer?\nThis is the second main issue for the\n first premise\n of the argument from queerness, which we identified above. The answer\nis not entirely clear. Here are a few things that could be meant.\n\nI. A kind of fact is queer if it is non-natural.\nPerhaps an irreducibly normative favoring relation could not be a\nnatural relation and this is what would be queer about it. On this\nview, normative facts are not continuous with the natural order, and\nthat in itself is what makes them objectionable. They are like facts\nabout ghosts, or gods, or gremlins. (Notice that this still leaves\nopen what it is about normative facts that makes them discontinuous\nwith the natural order \u2013 that is the business of the next\nsection.)\n\nThe problem, of course, even assuming that normative facts would be\nnon-natural, is that it is not clear what exactly the objection is to\nthe idea that there are non-natural facts. Clearly metaphysical\nnaturalists would reject the idea, for metaphysical naturalism is the\nview that the only facts are natural ones. But we cannot simply assume\nthat metaphysical naturalism is true, or that it would be\nobjectionable to reject it. If the argument from queerness rests on\nthis assumption, it will only be convincing to those who already are\nnaturalists. For an error theorist who hopes to convince anyone\nwho\u2019s not a dyed-in-the-wool naturalist, this is not the right\nway to run the argument from queerness.\n\nII. A kind of fact is queer if it would be fundamentally\ndifferent from everything else \u2013 if it is \u201csui\ngeneris\u201d, in the going lingo. Mackie often talks as if this\nis his concern:\n\n\nIf there were objective moral values, then they would be entities or\nqualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from\nanything else in the universe. (Mackie 1977: 38)\n\n\nWell, of course everything is different from everything else,\nso a lot must ride on that \u201cutterly\u201d. We think one way of\nreading the concern here is that queerness consists in fundamental\ndifference in kind.\n\nOn this reading, for a class of things to be queer is for their\nexistence to entail a new addition to the bottommost layer of reality.\n(We leave this metaphor unexplored, since that would mire us in\ncontroversy about how best to make sense of the notion of metaphysical\nfundamentality.) In other words, to determine whether a class of\nthings is queer, we can run something like the following test: take\ntwo worlds, W1 and W2. They\nare qualitatively identical except that W2 has\nthings of kind K, whereas W1 does not.\n(Or, more precisely, they are qualitatively identical except for the\nexistence of things of kind K in W2, and\nany other differences entailed ipso facto by the existence of some\nK things.) Question: are there more kinds of things in the\nbasic layer of reality in W2 than in\nW1? If so, then K things are queer.\n\nNote that on this test, K things don\u2019t have to be queer\nin virtue of their K-ness in order to be queer. It\ncould be that they entail the existence of some distinct kind of\nthing, and that kind would constitute a fundamental addition to our\nontology. Perhaps, that is, K things actually don\u2019t\nfall in the fundamental layer of reality, but they entail the\nexistence of L things, and those are both fundamental and not present\nin otherwise identical worlds without K things.\n\nThe problem with this understanding of the queerness objection is that\nit overgeneralizes. Every fundamental kind of thing turns out to be\nqueer! Supposing that the property of physicalness is fundamental,\nthen, comparing a world W1 without physical things\nto a world W2 that has physical things,\nW2 will have more kinds of thing in its basic\nlayer than W1. So, physical things are queer!\nCombine this with the commitment in\n premise (2)\n that there are no queer things, and you get the result that there are\nno physical objects. (Even on the weaker versions of those premises,\nwe get the result that we shouldn\u2019t believe in physical objects,\nor that there is strong prima facie reason not to believe in\nthem.) The argument can be run on any possible fundamental kind. (See\nMorton & Sampson 2014 on this point.)\n\nAnd suffice it to say that the error theorist about normativity\nprobably doesn\u2019t want to be an error theorist about literally\nany possible fundamental kind of thing. Among other reasons, assuming\nthat no non-fundamental kind of thing could exist without fundamental\nkinds, this would entail that nothing exists. And we\u2019d be\nwilling to bet that that is going to be too rich for any error\ntheorist\u2019s blood.\n\nNow, perhaps there is some more local concern about normativity\u2019s\nbeing fundamental. That is, perhaps there\u2019s something queer\nabout normative facts being at the bottommost level of reality that is\nunique to normativity: i.e., perhaps it\u2019s queer that\nnormative facts in particular would be at the bottom layer of\nreality. This would undermine the above overgeneralization objection.\nMaybe, for example, it is strange that normative facts would be\nfundamental because it is taken as a truism that normative facts\ndepend on non-normative ones. And how could they depend\n(metaphysically?) on anything else if they\u2019re fundamental? But\nsuch attempts at more local fundamentality worries would run into\ntheir own complications \u2013 e.g., what is the relationship between\nthe kind of dependence involved between the normative and the\nnon-normative, on the one hand, and fundamentality on the other? We\nwon\u2019t delve any deeper into such issues here.\n\nIII. Finally, perhaps a kind of fact is queer when a theory\nthat included it would not be parsimonious. Olson\nsometimes talks like this is what he means:\n\n\n[M]oral error theorists can apply Occam\u2019s razor. If our moral\npractices and beliefs can be explained without appeal to irreducibly\nnormative properties and facts, a theory that dispenses with such\nproperties and facts will have the advantage of being in this respect\nthe more ontologically parsimonious theory. (2014: 147)\n\n\nSo on this understanding of queerness, the problem is that normative\nfacts somehow create a less parsimonious picture of the world.\n\nThere are many ways we can think of parsimony (see Sober 2015). We\ndon\u2019t need to get too technical here. We think that the most\nplausible view favoring parsimony would hold that, other things being\nequal, a theory is objectionable insofar as it entails the existence\nof more kinds of thing than a competing theory does. On this reading,\nwe are getting close to the suggestion that queerness is a matter of\nadding a fundamental kind to our ontology, especially if parsimony\napplies (or is especially strong) only at the level of\nfundamental kinds.\n\nAt any rate, if queerness is just relative lack of parsimony, the\nerror theorist is opening up a can of worms. Many people are not sold\non the value of parsimony in theory selection \u2013 or are not sold on\nits value outside of empirical contexts (see Huemer 2009). Those who\nare sold on the value of parsimony count it as a pro\ntanto consideration to be weighed against a host of other\nfactors. That means that even granting that normative facts are queer\n(in the sense that postulating them is less parsimonious than not\ndoing so), this does not by itself establish that they do not exist,\nor that we shouldn\u2019t believe in them. In other words,\ninterpreting the\n first premise\n of the argument from queerness in this way undermines the\n second premise,\n at least where the second premise is read strongly as the claim that\nthere are no queer facts. (See Morton & Sampson 2014 for a fuller\nargument against queerness as lack of parsimony.)\n\nOf course, perhaps the error theorist could reply that it\u2019s not\nqueerness alone that shows that there are no normative facts.\nPerhaps, for example, this conclusion is supported by\nqueerness \u2013 i.e., lack of parsimony, here \u2013 together with the\nfact that normative facts are not necessary as part of the explanation\nof any observation. Jean Hampton (1998: 21\u201322) seems to think\nthat something like this is going on in the argument from queerness.\nThis would make the argument from queerness a version of\nHarman\u2019s (1977) argument. As such, it would mire the error\ntheorist in all the issues surrounding that argument, which we will\nnot delve into here. (But see Sturgeon 1985 and Majors 2007 for\ndiscussion.)\n2.3 Other Arguments for Error Theory\n\nThe argument from queerness is not the only argument for error theory.\nHere we\u2019ll just briefly outline one other \u2013 one that is more\nexplicitly for normative error theory in general. The\nargument runs roughly as follows:\n\nThere are no necessarily coextensive but distinct\nproperties. (I.e, all necessarily coextensive properties are\nidentical.)\nIf any normative property N exists, then\nit is necessarily coextensive with some natural property.\nSo, if any normative property N exists,\nthen it is identical to some natural property.\nNormative properties are not identical to natural\nproperties.\nTherefore, there are no normative properties.\n\n\nBart Streumer has given this argument, across a number of articles and\na book (see his 2011, 2013, and 2017).\n\nThe first phase of the argument, to\n sub-conclusion (3),\n is defended by philosophers such as Frank Jackson (1998: ch. 5) and,\nin more general form, in a non-metaethical context, Jaegwon Kim\n(1993).\n (1)\n is presented largely as an intuitive criterion of property identity.\nGiven certain assumptions,\n (2)\n can be proven just from the claim that the normative supervenes on\nthe natural. This is the claim that there can be no normative\ndifference in how things are without a natural difference in them (see\nentry on\n supervenience).\n We won\u2019t walk through the proof here \u2013 though see Bader\n(2017) for a very succinct summary \u2013 but consider the following\nsimplified version. Assume \u2013 the simplifying step \u2013 that the\nnormative property wrongness supervenes on only one natural\nproperty: failure to maximize utility. Then, whenever an\naction instantiates wrongness, it instantiates that natural\nproperty, and vice versa \u2013 given that the relevant assumptions\nobtain. And, assuming that supervenience holds with metaphysical\nnecessity, so will this covariation. Wrongness will be necessarily\ncoextensive with the property of being a failure to maximize utility,\nso (given\n premise 1)\n it will be identical to that property.\n\nStreumer defends\n (4),\n the last step to the error theoretic conclusion, the claim that\nnormative properties are not natural ones. Arguments for this claim\nare, however, pivotal to many arguments about the nature of\nnormativity, and not merely to an argument for the error theory. They\nare pivotal in arguments in favor of non-naturalism, the view that\nnormative properties exist but are not natural properties. And they\nare pivotal in arguments in favor of non-cognitivist/expressivist\ntheories, theories that hold that normative predicates do not ascribe\nor refer to normative properties at all, but have a very different\nsemantic role. So, since arguments against normative naturalism are of\nvery wide importance, we will consider them separately.\n3. Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation?\n\nWe have been helping ourselves to the ideas of a normative\nproperty and a normative fact, but we haven\u2019t yet\nconsidered in a systematic way views about what the\nnormativity of such properties and facts might consist in. As\nwe explained, the queerness argument for the error theory rests on the\nidea that some property of normative facts is queer, and the leading\ncandidate seems to be the normativity of the normative facts.\nOne way to answer the queerness argument, then, would be to provide an\nexplanation of what the property of being normative consists in, and a\nnaturalistic explanation would ideally put to rest the worry that\nthere is something queer about normativity. This is one reason to take\nseriously the question whether normativity can be explained\nnaturalistically.\n\nNon-naturalists deny that normative properties are natural ones, often\nbecause they hold that the normativity of these properties rules out\ntheir being natural ones. The idea here is that natural properties are\nnot and could not be normative. But the issue whether a normative\nproperty could be a natural one is not the same as the issue whether\nnormativity can be given a naturalistic explanation. Normative\nnaturalists hold that normative predicates ascribe or refer to natural\nproperties, and some if not all normative naturalists would contend\nthat normative properties are natural ones. But this does not\ncommit them to the view that normativity can be explained\nnaturalistically. It is open to a normative naturalist to deny that\nnormativity can be explained at all. So the dispute between\nnaturalists and their opponents, including non-naturalists, cuts\nacross the issue raised by our question.\n\nIn this section, then, we explore whether normativity can be given a\nnaturalistic explanation. In the next section, we explore a variety of\nputative explanations of normativity, including naturalistic ones.\n\nWe begin by clarifying our question. An explanation puts an\nexplanandum into an explanatory relation with an\nexplanans. So, first, what exactly is the explanandum in the\ncase of our question? Second, what kind of explanatory relation is at\nissue? What relation between explanandum and naturalistic explanans\nare we looking for? There are different kinds of explanation. And\nthird, the explanans of a naturalistic explanation would be something\nnaturalistic, but what would count as a naturalistic\nexplanans?\n\nThe explanandum in question is the property of being\nnormative, one might say. But we need to bring this into sharper\nfocus. The error theory contests the idea that there are normative\nproperties and normative facts. Certain other anti-realist theories\nmight agree with the error theory that there are not any normative\nfacts \u2013 understood as worldly states of\naffairs \u2013 but, as we will see, might not deny that there are\nnormative truths. And all of these theories, as well as\nrealist theories, would agree that there are normative\nconcepts and normative claims and\njudgments. As we said before, the main area of debate among\nthese theories concerns whether there are worldly normative properties\nand facts. Nevertheless, our question in this section is about the\npossibility of providing a naturalistic explanation of\nnormativity. Normative properties and facts (if there are\nany) instantiate the property of being normative, but so do normative\nconcepts, normative claims, normative judgments, and normative truths\n(if there are any). The explanandum of the question we are asking,\nthen, is this property of being normative. Is it possible to provide a\nnaturalistic explanation of this property?\n\nPerhaps, however, there is more than one such property. Perhaps there\nis a family of \u201cnormativity properties\u201d. For it is not\nclear that normative properties, facts, truths, and claims would all\nbe normative in virtue of having exactly the same property. Perhaps\nnormative claims are normative in virtue of having the normative truth\nconditions they have, whereas these truth conditions are normative in\nvirtue of the normativity of the properties that partly constitute\nthem. Perhaps, then, what normative concepts, claims, truths, facts,\nand properties have in common, assuming there are such things, is not\nthat they all instantiate the property of being normative,\nbut rather that they instantiate one of the properties from\nthe \u201cnormativity family\u201d.\n\nWhat kind of explanation is at issue? As we understand matters, we are\nlooking for a \u201cconstitutive explanation\u201d, an account of\nthe essential nature of the property (or properties) of being\nnormative, or a \u201creal definition\u201d of the property (or of\neach of the properties) (Rosen 2010; also Schroeder 2005, King 1998).\nA non-normative example of such an explanation would be the account of\nthe property of being an acid according to which to be an\nacid is to be a proton donor. The question is whether there could be a\nrelevantly similar naturalistic account of the essential nature of the\nproperty of being normative. Or, if there is more than one\nsuch property, the question is whether there could be naturalistic\naccounts of the essential natures of the normativity properties.\n\nIn a naturalistic constitutive explanation of the property\n(or properties) of being normative, the explanans (for each\nnormativity property) would be a natural property, or perhaps a\nnaturalistic \u201ccondition\u201d, all the constituents of which\nare natural properties. For example, if to be an acid is to be a\nproton donor, then it is a necessary truth that every acid satisfies\nthe condition, or has the complex property, of being a proton donor.\nOur question, then, is whether there could be a similar explanation of\nnormativity. Could there be an explanation of the normativity of\nnormative facts according to which, for such a fact to be normative is\nfor it to satisfy a condition X, Y, Z where\neach constituent of this condition is something natural?\n\nUnfortunately, it is tricky to specify what we mean by a\n\u201cnatural\u201d property. For our purposes in this entry, as a\nfirst approximation, we might take natural properties to be, roughly,\nthose that figure in scientific theories. Examples would be the\nproperties that figure in biology, economics, psychology, and so on,\nincluding the property of being an acid, the property of being\ndeciduous, the property of being inflationary, and so on. More\nbroadly, as a second approximation, we might say that a natural\nproperty is such that any substantive knowledge we could have about\nits instantiation would be empirical. This broader usage would allow\nus to count the properties of being an automobile and being a lawn\nchair to count as natural ones. (For discussion of the idea of a\nnatural property, see entries on\n moral naturalism\n and\n moral non-naturalism).\n\nWe have said that the explanandum of our question is the property of\nbeing normative or perhaps the family of normativity properties. A\ncomplication is that there are philosophical disagreements about the\nnature of properties, or about the use of the word\n\u201cproperty\u201d.\n\nAs we said before, we understand properties to be worldly\ncharacteristics that underlie objective, genuine, worldly similarities\namong things. Call this the \u201crobust\u201d or\n\u201crealist\u201d view of properties. On a very different\n\u201cminimalist\u201d view, to speak of a property is simply to\ntalk in an abstract way about uses of predicates, such as their use in\ndescribing things. On such a view, our taking it to be true that it\nwould be bad to drink more Dr. Peppers commits us to there being a\n\u201cproperty\u201d that is ascribed by \u201cbad\u201d, but this\nis nothing but a commitment to (roughly) whatever is involved in the\npredicative use of \u201cbad\u201d. Similarly, on such a view, the\nidea that there is a property ascribed by \u201cnormative\u201d is\nmerely a commitment to (roughly) whatever is involved in the\npredicative use of \u201cnormative\u201d.\n\nThe upshot is that there are both minimalist and realist views about\nthe nature of the explanandum of our question. On the realist view,\nthe challenge is to explain the nature of the property or properties\nthat underlie the objective similarity among normative properties, in\nvirtue of which they are normative, as well as the objective\nsimilarities among normative concepts, normative facts, and normative\nclaims. On a minimalist view, the challenge is very different. It is,\nroughly, to explain what is involved in the predicative use of\n\u201cnormative\u201d. Minimalism leaves open what might be\ninvolved. For all that it says, the predicative use of\n\u201cnormative\u201d might involve ascribing a realist property.\nHowever, there are alternatives, which, as we will see, are taken up\nby anti-realist metaethical views such as non-cognitivist\nexpressivism.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there are also minimalist views about the\nmeanings of the words \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d, or\nabout how these terms are used. On one minimalist view about the\nmeaning of \u201ctrue\u201d, for example, to say it is true that it\nwould be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper is just a way of saying that\nit would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper. And on one minimalist\nview about \u201cfact\u201d, facts are simply true propositions.\nThese minimalist views seem to imply that uses of \u201ctrue\u201d\nand \u201cfact\u201d, as well as uses of \u201cproperty\u201d, do\nnot have any metaphysical implications. Most important, they do not\ncommit us to the existence of worldly states of affairs or worldly\nproperties that underwrite genuine similarities among things.\n\nMinimalist views of these kinds are not uncommon. Minimalism figures\nin the quasi-realist expressivism advocated by Simon Blackburn (2006).\nArguably Parfit\u2019s \u201cnon-metaphysical non-naturalism\u201d\n(2011: vol 2, 486) or \u201cnon-realist cognitivism\u201d (2017: 49)\nalso incorporates minimalist views. So-called \u201cquietist\nrealist\u201d positions also arguably involve a kind of minimalism\n(see Dworkin 1996 and 2011: part 1; Scanlon 2014).\n\nIn addition to the difference between realist and minimalist\nunderstandings of the explanandum, there is a difference between\nrobust and formalist understandings. We will explain this distinction\nin\n section 3.1.\n The formalist view is a kind of deflationary view about normativity.\nIt would sidestep our question, in effect. There is controversy about\nwhether there is such a thing as robust normativity, but our question\npresupposes that there is such a thing and asks whether its nature can\nbe given a naturalistic explanation. We will therefore set aside the\nformalist view after a brief discussion of it.\n\nIn\n section 3.2,\n we introduce the distinction between normative realism and normative\nanti-realism. We sketch the challenge that our question poses to\nnormative realism, and the kinds of answers that realists might\nprovide. Realism is, however, compatible with fundamentally different\nviews about the explanation of normativity. In\n section 3.3,\n we consider the \u201cprimitivist\u201d view that the nature of\nnormativity cannot be explained at all, at least not in non-normative\nterms. Primitivism is characteristic of non-naturalism, but it is also\navailable to naturalists.\n\nIn\n section 3.4,\n we introduce a distinction between \u201cconceptualism\u201d and\n\u201cobjectualism\u201d, two views about the kinds of things that\ninstantiate the property of being normative.\n\u201cObjectualist\u201d theories hold that there are worldly\nnormative properties and states of affairs, whereas\n\u201cconceptualist\u201d theories deny this and hold instead that\nnormativity lies exclusively, or at least fundamentally, in the realm\nof thought. Conceptualism is, we think, the characteristic position of\nanti-realists; at least, this is so if we set aside the error theory,\nbut conceptualism is also compatible with normative realism. In\n section 3.4.1\n and\n section 3.4.2,\n we look at anti-realist and realist versions of conceptualism,\nrespectively.\n\nFinally, in\n section 3.5,\n we turn to objectualism, and the issue whether there might be a\nsuccessful form of reductive normative naturalism. This kind of theory\nwould provide an ambitious answer to our organizing question. It would\ncombine a realist, robust view of the property of being normative with\nthe objectualist view that this property is instantiated by states of\naffairs and first-order ethical properties. It then contends that it\nis possible to provide a naturalistic constitutive explanation of the\nproperty (or properties) of being normative.\n\nThe question we address in this section concerns whether a\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of normativity can be\nprovided. In this section, we address the question in abstract\nterms. In the following section,\n section 4,\n we explore a variety of putative explanations of normativity,\nincluding naturalistic ones. The best way to show that a naturalistic\nexplanation of normativity is possible would be to provide one.\n3.1 Normative Formalism\n\nThe basic idea of normative formalism can perhaps be conveyed if we\nmention that there at least seem to be truths about what one has most\nreason to do in a game. We pointed this out before, in\ndiscussing reasons fundamentalism. There also seem to be truths about\nwhat one ought to do in a game. In chess, for instance, one\nought to castle early and there is reason to protect one\u2019s\nqueen. One might think, however, that this \u201cought\u201d and\nthis reason have in themselves no genuine authority over a\nperson\u2019s decisions, not even if she is playing chess. Of course,\na person might have a prudential reason to play well, or she might\nhave a moral reason to do so if she promised, but chess reasons in\nthemselves have no authority over her. They are not\n\u201crobustly\u201d normative in the philosophically most\ninteresting and important sense. Chess reasons have no genuine claim\non anyone\u2019s attention in the way that the moral reason to be\nloyal to friends does. Normative formalism rejects this line of\nthought. On the formalist view, the idea of normative authority, and\nthe idea of genuine or robustly normative reasons or\n\u201coughts\u201d, are empty. There is nothing to normativity\nbeyond the fact that certain rules or norms \u201ccall for\u201d\ncertain actions or decisions in certain situations in the way that the\nrules of chess and considerations of strategy in chess call for\ncastling early.\n\nFormalism has been defended by Evan Tiffany (2007; see also Hubin\n2001), and it seems to be implicit in places where it is not\nexplicitly defended. It is compatible with a variety of positions,\nincluding normative realism, as we will explain. Yet formalism is a\nradical view. It seems to imply that, other things being equal, the\nreason to castle early is no different with respect to its authority\nover actions or decisions, and with respect to its normativity, from\nthe reason to be honest and truthful.\n\nFor our purposes, the important point is that formalism offers an\naffirmative answer to the question we are discussing in this section,\nfor it explains normativity on the basis of the logic and content of\nnorms and rules that have currency in relevant social contexts\n(Tiffany 2007; Parfit 2011, II: 308\u2013309). H.L.A. Hart arguably\nhas a similar view about the normativity of law (1994: 257; see Copp\n2019). If normative formalism is correct, then, there is a ready\nanswer to Mackie\u2019s argument from queerness. For, if formalism is\ncorrect, normativity is no more mysterious than facts about the\nrules of games or facts about social norms and social practices.\n\nThe controversial issue, however, is whether there is such a thing as\nthe \u201crobust\u201d or \u201cauthoritative\u201d normativity\nthat formalism rejects. Our question presupposes that there is such a\nthing, for otherwise the organizing question we are asking in this\nsection is neither especially interesting nor challenging. For this\nreason, we set aside the formalist view in what follows.\n3.2 Normative Realism\n\nNormative realism sees a strict analogy between normative truths, such\nas the putative truth that it would be bad to have another Dr. Pepper,\nand non-normative truths, such as the fact that Dr. Pepper is sweet.\nIn each case, there is a declarative sentence that expresses a\nproposition that can be the intensional object of a belief, and,\nfurther, the belief, proposition, and sentence are true just when the\nstate of affairs they represent obtains. So, if our beliefs are\ncorrect, there is the state of affairs or the fact that Dr. Pepper is\nsweet, and there is the state of affairs or the fact that it would be\nbad to have another Dr. Pepper. We believe both that Dr. Pepper is\nsweet and that it would be bad to have another one. And we express\nthese beliefs by asserting that Dr. Pepper is sweet or that it would\nbe bad to have another one, respectively.\n\nAccordingly, normative realists hold both that there are states of\naffairs that are represented by, and that are the truth conditions of,\nnormative propositions, and that there are properties that are\nreferred to or ascribed by normative predicates. Mind-independent\nrealist theories go beyond this basic position to add that the truth\nconditions of normative truths are \u201cmind-independent\u201d in\nsome important sense. (We discuss the idea of mind-independence in\n section 5\n of this entry.) So we can distinguish between the view we will call\n\u201cbasic normative realism\u201d and the view we will call\n\u201cmind-independent normative realism\u201d. Some philosophers\nwant to reserve the term \u201crealism\u201d for the\nmind-independent form, and we will also tend to follow this usage\nexcept where we want to describe a theory as an example of basic\nrealism.\n\nThere is also the distinction, among realist theories, between\nnormative naturalism and normative non-naturalism. As we said before,\nnormative naturalists hold that normative predicates ascribe or refer\nto natural properties, and some if not all normative\nnaturalists hold that normative properties are\nnatural ones. We will discuss normative naturalism and non-naturalism\nin what follows.\n\nNote a couple of points. First, there is nothing in normative\nrealism that commits realists to holding that the normative properties\nand facts are robustly normative rather than merely formally\nnormative. But we have set aside normative formalism. In what follows,\nwe consider attempts to account for robust normativity. Second,\nas we will explain in\n section 3.4,\n normative realism is compatible with a kind of normative\nconceptualism, and this means that realists are not committed to\nholding that the wordly states of affairs that are the truth\nconditions of normative propositions, and the properties\nthat are ascribed by normative predicates, are themselves\nnormative. They could hold instead, roughly, that normativity is\na feature only of normative concepts.\n\nAnti-realist theories deny one or more of the claims that are\ndefinitive of realism, whether of basic realism or of mind-independent\nrealism. There are several different kinds of normative anti-realism.\nOne kind is normative nihilism, or the error theory, which we have\nalready discussed. Non-cognitivist expressivism is another kind of\nanti-realist theory. A third kind is the non-realist cognitivism that\nwas advocated by Derek Parfit (2011, 2017). Still another kind is a\nfamily of \u201cconstructivist \u201dtheories, which reject the\nmind-independence condition, although some of them seem committed to\nthe tenets of basic normative realism (Copp 2013). For examples, see\nChristine Korsgaard\u2019s work (1996) and Sharon Street\u2019s\n(2008, 2010). (This entry does not discuss non-realist cognitivism or\nconstructivism. See the entry on\n constructivism in metaethics.)\n We consider anti-realist attempts to account for robust normativity\nin\n section 3.4\n as well as in some of the subsections in\n section 4.\n\nIf a theory countenances the existence of normative facts,\nnormative properties, normative propositions, and normative concepts,\nit ideally would want to explain what the normativity of each of\nthese consists in. To bring the challenge into focus, consider a\nnormative property such as wrongness. Ideally, one might\nthink, realists would want to provide accounts on two levels. First,\nthey might aspire to provide an account of the essential nature of\nwrongness itself, an account that reveals, inter\nalia, that wrongness is essentially normative. Second,\nrealists might aspire to provide an account of the essential nature of\nthe second-order property of being normative that is instantiated by\nwrongness. These accounts would be constitutive explanations,\nin the sense we introduced. Our question is whether the account of the\nlatter, second-order property could be naturalistic.\n\nWith respect to the normative concepts \u2013 concepts such as the\nconcepts <wrong> or <virtue> \u2013 the explanatory\naccounts we are looking for would be conceptual analyses, so\nthey presumably would be a priori. This does not mean that they would\nbe obviously true, nor even that any rational person who had\nthe concept would recognize a correct analysis as being correct. (For\ndiscussion of this point, see entries\n analysis\n and\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n With respect to the normative properties \u2013 properties such as the\nproperty of being wrong, or that of being a virtue \u2013 the\nexplanatory accounts we are looking for would be metaphysical\nanalyses, so, arguably, they would not be a priori (Schroeder\n2005, King 1998, Rosen 2010). Since these accounts would be (putative)\naccounts of the essential natures of the properties, they\nwould be necessarily true if true at all, and they would underwrite\nidentity claims. If it is the essential nature of something\u2019s\nbeing an acid that it be a proton donor, then to be an acid is to be a\nproton donor. If it the essential nature of wrongness is being\nA, B, and C, then to be wrong is to be\nA, B, and C.\n\nOne might think it is obvious that there could not be a correct\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of any of the normative concepts\nor properties, nor of the normativity property or properties\nthemselves. But before we turn to this issue, we will consider a\nvariety of other views, both realist and anti-realist, and discuss\ntheir approaches to explaining normativity.\n3.3 Primitivism: Non-Naturalism and Naturalism\n\nOne camp of realists holds that the nature of normativity\ncannot be fully explained. There is no correct constitutive\nexplanation of normativity. We might express their view by saying\nthat, for them, normativity is primitive. It is\nunanalyzable.\n\nWe distinguish primitivism about normativity as such from primitivism\nabout the normative properties or concepts. Primitivism about the\nnormative properties or concepts holds that the nature of these\nproperties or concepts cannot be fully explained. There is no correct\nconstitutive explanation of their nature. Primitivism about\nnormativity as such holds that the nature of normativity cannot be\nfully explained.\n\nIt seems, however, that primitivism about normativity as such commits\none to primitivism about the normative properties and concepts. For it\nis of the nature of the normative properties and concepts that they\nare normative. So primitivism about normativity implies that any\nconstitutive account of the nature of a normative property or concept\nwould have an unanalyzable constituent, the second-order normativity\nproperty. To illustrate, consider the view that all normative\nproperties can be reduced to some condition about reasons. Perhaps for\nan action to be wrong is, in part, for there to be reasons against it.\nBut reasons are normative considerations, so the primitivist about\nnormativity will say that the normativity of reasons is primitive.\nGeneralizing, according to primitivism about normativity, any\nconstitutive explanation of a normative property would have the\nnormativity property as an unanalyzable constituent. It therefore\nseems that primitivism about normativity implies or at least supports\na primitivism about the normative properties and concepts.\n\nPrimitivists typically are non-naturalists who hold that\nnormative properties belong to a metaphysically different kind than\nnatural properties. There is, however, room for a primitivism that is\nnaturalist. There might be natural properties the intrinsic nature of\nwhich is not open to analysis or to constitutive explanation, so we\nshould perhaps be open to the idea that the normative properties are\namong the primitive natural ones. Perhaps, too, the second-order\nproperty of being normative is a natural one, where there is no\ncorrect constitutive explanation of its nature. There are also\nprimitivist anti-realist theories, such as Parfit\u2019s cognitivist\nanti-realism and constructivist theories that deploy unanalyzed\nconceptions of rationality.\n\nThere is, then, a primitivism about normativity as such as well as a\nprimitivism about normative properties. There is also a primitivist\nview about normative concepts according to which these concepts are\nnot analyzable. Non-naturalists typically hold that both the\nnormative concepts and the normative properties are primitive and\nunanalyzable (see entry on\n moral non-naturalism).\n Further, naturalists who are primitivists about normative properties\nmight also be primitivists about the normative concepts. Indeed, even\nnaturalists who reject primitivism about normative properties might\nnevertheless accept primitivism about the normative concepts, and\nthereby hold that the normative concepts are unanalyzable (see Railton\n2003).\n\nIt is tempting to say that a theory that provided a constitutive\nexplanation of the nature of normativity would clearly be preferable\nto primitivism. For, we assume, the goal, in theorizing, is to explain\nthings. Accordingly, regardless of the subject matter, other things\nbeing equal, a theory that says that such and such cannot be explained\nis on that count alone less attractive than a theory that offers an\nexplanation, or that at least leaves open the possibility of an\nexplanation. Nevertheless, of course, in the absence of an\nexplanation, we need to be open to the possibility that one is not\ngoing to be found, and even, perhaps, to the possibility that, for\nsome reason, no explanation could be found. There are physical\nconstants that are unexplained in our best physical theories, for\nexample. Perhaps normativity similarly is not open to explanation.\n3.4 Normative Conceptualism\n\nWe have assumed that there are worldly states of affairs and\nproperties, and we take it that there are normative truths, but this\ndoes not force us to the conclusion that there are normative states of\naffairs and normative properties. Normative objectualism holds that\nthere are such things, but normative conceptualism holds that\nnormativity lies in the realm of thought rather than in the realm of\nreality that we represent in our thought. Objectualism holds that\nthere are states of affairs and properties that instantiate the\nnormativity property (or one of the normativity properties), whereas\nconceptualism denies this and holds that it is only concepts and\npropositions that are normative. Conceptualist theories agree that\nthere are normative truths, but deny that any states of affairs or\nproperties are normative\n3.4.1 Anti-realist conceptualism: non-cognitivist expressivism\n\nOne example of normative conceptualism is the anti-realist view\ngenerally called \u201cnon-cognitivist expressivism\u201d, or simply\n\u201cexpressivism\u201d. This is the view that, roughly, normative\nassertions express conative attitudes such as approval, disapproval,\naversion, or subscription to a norm. Such attitudes are akin to\ndesires rather than to cognitive states, such as beliefs, that\nrepresent the world as being one way or another. Expressivism holds\nthat normative judgments are at least partly constituted by conative\nattitudes taken toward things.\n\nIn the simplest cases, a normative judgment might just be an attitude.\nFor example, one might hold that the assertion that it would be bad to\ndrink Dr. Pepper expresses an aversion to drinking Dr. Pepper, and,\nmoreover, that this aversion just is the judgment that it\nwould be bad to drink Dr. Pepper. In more complex cases, a normative\njudgment might have some non-normative content, but inasmuch as it is\nnormative, it would be partly constituted by an attitude. An example\nof this might be the assertion that Justin was bad to drink another\nDr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivists accordingly take normative judgments to be very\ndifferent from ordinary beliefs. The belief that Dr. Pepper is sweet\nis a cognitive state of mind that takes the proposition that Dr.\nPepper is sweet as its intensional object and that represents Dr.\nPepper as having the property sweetness. The assertion that\nDr. Pepper is sweet expresses this belief. But, in the expressivist\nview, the assertion that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper\ndoes not express a cognitive state of mind that takes a proposition as\nits object and that represents drinking another Dr. Pepper as having a\nproperty. It rather expresses an aversion or some similar conative\nattitude.\n\nOne consideration that has motivated expressivism is the idea that\nhaving a normative judgment entails being motivated in some\nappropriate way. For example, we would expect that a person who thinks\nit would be bad to have another Dr. Pepper is motivated to avoid or to\noppose having another Dr. Pepper. According to the position called\nmotivational judgment internalism (MJI), such motivation is entailed\nby having a normative judgment. Motivation is internal to\nnormative judgment. Expressivists argue that the best explanation of\nMJI is the expressivist thesis that normative judgments consist at\nleast in part in motivating conative attitudes of some kind, such as\naversions or attractions.\n\nExpressivism has also been motivated by some of the considerations\nthat we explored in discussing arguments for the error theory. There\nis the idea that normative states of affairs would be metaphysically\nproblematic \u2013 perhaps because, it might seem, states of affairs of\nthis kind would have to have an intrinsic practical force that is\nunintelligible \u2013 or, it might seem, they would have to have an\nunintelligible intrinsic magnetism or repulsion. If this is correct,\nthen, it might seem, it would be a mistake to postulate the existence\nof normative states of affairs. This reasoning can be contested, as we\nsaw. But even if it is correct, it need not lead to an error theory.\nThere is the alternative of taking our normative judgments to consist\nin conative attitudes, such as aversions or attractions, rather than\nto be beliefs that purport to represent normative states of affairs.\nExpressivism can seem in this way to make room for normative truths\nwithout postulating the existence of normative states of affairs.\n\nExpressivism can make room for normative truths and facts if it is\ncombined with minimalist views of the meanings of \u201ctrue\u201d\nand \u201cfact\u201d. The result of such a combination would allow\nexpressivism to make sense of the claim that it is true, and a fact,\nthat it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper. For, on the\nminimalist view, to claim these things would simply be a way of\nclaiming that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivism might also be combined with a minimalist view of the use\nof the term \u201cbelief\u201d, according to which beliefs are the\npsychological states, whatever their nature, that are expressed by\nassertions. On this view, an expressivist could agree that we believe\nit would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper. But, for the\nexpressivist, this \u201cbelief\u201d or judgment is a conative\nstate of aversion or something like aversion. It is not the kind of\ncognitive state that is expressed when we assert that Dr Pepper is\nsweet. On this view, then, there are at least two radically different\nkinds of belief \u2013 cognitive states that take propositions as their\nobjects and conative states that consist in having a conative attitude\nto something. And there presumably are also mixed states.\n\nAs we mentioned, Blackburn has a view that combines expressivism with\nminimalism about \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfact\u201d, and\n\u201cproperty\u201d, and his view also incorporates a minimalism\nabout \u201cbelief\u201d (Blackburn 2006). He calls this position,\n\u201cquasi-realism\u201d.\n\nAn expressivist would presumably deny that there is a worldly state of\naffairs of its being bad to have another Dr. Pepper. There is the\naversion to drinking another Dr. Pepper, of course. But the claim that\nit would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper is not a psychological\nclaim. It is not a claim about an aversion, although it\nexpresses an aversion. That is, this aversion is not a state\nof affairs that makes it true that it would be bad to drink another\nDr. Pepper. It is a psychological state that we express in saying it\nwould be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivism is, then, an example of normative conceptualism.\nProperly understood, it says, normativity is not a feature of states\nof affairs in the world; it is a feature of a way or ways of thinking\nof things. There are no normative states of affairs in the world.\nThere are only normative ways of thinking.\n\nIt is arguable that so-called quietism, as well as Parfit\u2019s\ncognitivist anti-realism, are also examples of normative\nconceptualism. They contend that normative thought and talk do not\ncommit us metaphysically to anything we wouldn\u2019t otherwise be\ncommitted to. So, presumably, they must agree with expressivism that\nnormativity is not to be accounted for by anything in our metaphysics.\nPerhaps, then, it is a feature of our ways of thinking of things.\n\nReturn now to the question whether normativity can be given a\nnaturalistic explanation. For the expressivist, this is the question\nwhether the normativity of normative judgments can be given a\nnaturalistic explanation. And their answer would presumably be\naffirmative. We have just sketched the kind of explanation an\nexpressivist would provide. We have, and we endorse, the\n\u201cbelief\u201d we might express by saying it would be bad to\ndrink another Dr. Pepper. This thought consists in having an aversion\nto drinking another Dr. Pepper. There is a variety of such attitudes\nor \u201cstances\u201d, to use Blackburn\u2019s term (2006), and\nthey are the characteristic constituents of normative thoughts. For a\nthought to be normative is, roughly, for it to have some such\nconstituent. This is a sketch of the expressivist answer to our\nquestion.\n\nNote that this account of normativity explains normative thought and\ntalk in a way that we might also use to explain slurring thought and\ntalk, such as talk about \u201ckikes\u201d, \u201chuns\u201d,\n\u201cYankees\u201d, and the like. One might think that this counts\nagainst expressivism since, we take it, the emotionally-laden slurring\nways of thinking of Jews, Germans, and Americans, are not\nnormative.\n\nThere are several examples of expressivism, including Allan\nGibbard\u2019s somewhat different but complementary approaches (1990,\n2003), and Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons\u2019s cognitivist\nexpressivism (2006). We do not explore these different theories. For\ndetailed discussion of expressivism, see Mark Schroeder (2010). See\nalso the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n3.4.2 Realist conceptualism\n\nNormative realism is a kind of cognitivism. It says that just as the\nassertion that Dr. Pepper is sweet expresses a belief, so the\nassertion that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper expresses a\nbelief \u2013 both express a cognitive state of mind that takes a\nproposition as its object and that represents the world as being one\nway or another. Quasi-realism would allow us to call conative states\nof mind, such as an aversion to drinking another Dr. Pepper,\n\u201cbeliefs\u201d, but it holds that beliefs of this kind are\nconative states that are different in their intrinsic nature from\nordinary beliefs. Cognitivists, including normative naturalists and\nnon-naturalists, hold that normative judgments are ordinary beliefs,\ncognitive states that represent worldly states of affairs that are\ntheir truth conditions.\n\nWe have already seen that there is an important difference between\nprimitivist forms of normative realism and forms of realism that aim\nto explain the intrinsic nature of the normativity properties. But\nthere is also an important difference between forms of normative\nrealism that affirm, and those that deny, that there are normative\nworldly states of affairs and normative properties.\n\nRealist normative conceptualism holds that normativity is a\nfeature of some of our ways of thinking of certain properties and\nstates of affairs rather than being a property of those properties and\nstates of affairs themselves. Hence, normativity is to be found in the\nrealm of thought rather than in the realm of reality that we represent\nin our thought. Realist normative conceptualism is a form at least of\nbasic normative realism since it holds that normative judgments\nrepresent worldly states of affairs that are their truth conditions,\nand that normative concepts are concepts of worldly properties. What\nit denies is that these states of affairs and properties are\nthemselves normative. Matti Eklund calls this view, or at least\nnaturalist versions of it, presentationalism (Eklund 2017: ch\n6).\n\nNormative conceptualism is an attractive position for normative\nnaturalists because it enables them to hold that the properties\nreferred to by the normative concepts are natural ones, but without\nhaving to provide a naturalistic constitutive explanation of the\nnormativity property instantiated by these properties. It avoids this\nchallenging problem because it denies that the property of being\nnormative is instantiated by any properties and, indeed, by any states\nof affairs. It holds that only normative concepts and propositions are\nnormative.\n\nThere is a subtly different version of naturalist normative\nconceptualism. On this version, there are normative states of\naffairs and properties, but their being normative is entirely\nderivative from the normativity of the normative ways of thinking that\nrepresent these states of affairs and properties. Their being\nnormative consists in their being represented by normative\npropositions or concepts. Their normativity is extrinsic, rather than\nintrinsic. It would seem to follow that these states of affairs and\nproperties could exist, or might have existed, without being\nnormative. The property we represent in thought as wrongness is\nnormative only because we think of it this way, and we might not have\nthought of it in this way. This implication should be compared with\nthe implication, of the other version of naturalist normative\nconceptualism, that there are no normative states of affairs or\nproperties.\n\nUnless it embraces primitivism, normative conceptualism still needs to\nexplain what it is about the normative concepts in virtue of which\nthey are normative. But this is a challenge it shares with all other\nforms of ethical naturalism and ethical non-naturalism, and perhaps\nalso with all forms of ethical anti-realism. Further, it is open to\nnaturalist normative conceptualism to embrace primitivism and agree\nwith non-naturalists that the normative concepts are not analyzable in\nnon-normative terms. For this thesis is not problematic to naturalism.\nNaturalism is primarily a metaphysical thesis about what there is. It\nis not a thesis about the analysis of our concepts or ways of\nthinking.\n\nOne problem faced by realist normative conceptualism is that it\narguably is a necessary truth that the properties referred to or\nrepresented by normative concepts are normative. For instance,\narguably, if any property is referred to or represented by our concept\n<wrong> it is the property wrongness. And unless\nit embraces error theory, normative conceptualism agrees that there is\na property that is referred to or represented by our concept\n<wrong>. So it is committed to there being a property\nwrongness. And it would seem to be a necessary truth that any\nsuch property is normative in itself and not merely in virtue of the\nfact that some normative concept of ours refers to it or represents\nit. If this is right, then unless it embraces error theory, realist\nnormative conceptualism faces a fatal problem.\n3.5 Normative Objectualism\n\nObjectualist theories, unlike conceptualist ones, hold that there are\nworldly states of affairs and properties that are themselves\nnormative. Objectualist theories take it that normativity is found in\nthe world, and not merely in the realm of thought about the world. It\nholds that certain properties and facts instantiate a normativity\nproperty.\n\nAs we saw, normative realism is compatible with both normative\nformalism and normative conceptualism, but it is typically\nobjectualist. In this section, then, we return to normative realism in\nits objectualist form. In\n section 3.1,\n we saw that normativity formalism provides an affirmative answer to\nour guiding question, since it explains normativity by reference to\nrules or norms or social practices. We set aside normativity formalism\nbecause the controversial issue is whether a robust or authoritative\nnormativity can be given a constitutive naturalistic explanation. In\n section 3.2\n we discussed the explanatory challenge faced by realist theories, and\nin\n section 3.3,\n we considered primitivist realist theories, which deny that any\nconstitutive explanation of normativity is possible.\n Section 3.4\n considered both anti-realist and realist versions of normativity\nconceptualism. Non-cognitivist expressivism is a kind of normativity\nconceptualism that offers a naturalistic constitutive explanation of\nthe normativity of normative judgments and concepts. Realist versions\nof conceptualism would either be primitivist, or they would aim to\nprovide a constitutive explanation of the normativity of normative\njudgments and concepts. In this section, we turn to objectualist forms\nof ethical realism and the question whether theories of this kinds are\nable to answer our guiding question.\n\nThere are both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of normativity\nobjectualism. Non-naturalism, however, is typically primitivist. It\ngives a negative answer to our guiding question. As we saw, ethical\nnaturalism can also be primitivist. But if a theory is going to offer\na constitutive explanation of normativity, or constitutive accounts of\nthe normative properties and concepts, in each case the explanans\nproposed by the theory is almost certain to be a natural property or\ncondition. That is, the theory is almost certain to be a kind of\nreductive normative naturalism. Accordingly, this section\ndiscusses theories of this kind.\n\nThere are many varieties of normative naturalism, as we have seen. All\nsuch theories have in common the realist claim that there are worldly\nstates of affairs that are represented by, and that are the truth\nconditions of, normative truths, and that there are properties that\nare referred to and ascribed by normative predicates. Objectualist\nviews add that these properties and states of affairs are normative.\nNaturalist views add that these states of affairs and properties are\nnatural ones.\n\nReductive normative naturalism claims that naturalistic\nconstitutive explanations of normativity and of the normative\nproperties and concepts are available, at least in principle. We began\n section 3\n with the question whether normativity can be given a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation. Reductive normative naturalism offers an\naffirmative answer. Some naturalists might merely have the\naspirational view that although an adequate reduction is not yet\navailable, we should expect there to be one in the offing, since the\nnormative states of affairs and properties are natural. But the most\ninteresting forms of reductive normative naturalism offer accounts of\nthe nature of normativity, or at least sketches of such. Theories of\nthis kind propose, for each normative explanandum and for the property\nof normativity itself, a natural property as its explanans.\n\nA distinction needs to be drawn between analytic and non-analytic\nreductive normative naturalism. Both kinds of theory claim that\nnormative properties are natural ones and both offer sketches of\nnaturalistic constitutive explanations of these properties. Analytic\ntheories contend that their analyses are conceptual truths,\nwhereas non-analytic ones do not contend this.\n\nThere are many objections to normative naturalism in general and to\nreductive normative naturalism in particular. In this entry, we do not\ninvestigate these objections in detail, or arguments in favor of\nnaturalism. For an examination of these objections and arguments, see\nentries on\n moral naturalism\n and\n moral non-naturalism.\n\nOne might think it is obvious that there could not be a\ncorrect naturalistic constitutive explanation of normativity or of the\nnormative properties. Consider the property wrongness,\nassuming there is such a thing. Assuming that this property is\nnormative, a correct constitutive explanation of the essential nature\nof this property would need to identify a natural property (or\nnaturalistic condition) as the explanans, and this natural property\nwould have to be normative. According to a kind of meta-ethical\nutilitarian naturalism, for example, for an action to be wrong is for\nit to fail to maximize the general happiness. Since wrongness\nis normative, this theory is correct only if the property failing\nto maximize the general happiness is normative. But it might seem\nobvious that this property is not normative, and therefore that the\nutilitarian naturalist view cannot be correct. It is part of the\nessential nature of wrongness that it is normative, but, one\nmight think, it obviously is not part of the essential nature\nof the property of failing to maximize the general happiness that it\nis normative. Indeed, it might seem, this property obviously is not\nnormative. Failing to maximize the general happiness is normatively\nrelevant, the utilitarian thinks, because an action that\nfails in this way is wrong for this reason \u2013 but this is not a\nmatter of its nature. Or so one might think. And, generalizing, one\nmight think that there could not be a correct naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of the nature of any of the normative\nproperties because natural properties are not normative.\n\nFor a similar reason, one might think there could not be a correct\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of the (second-order)\nproperty of being normative, or of any of the normativity properties.\nA correct naturalistic account of the essential nature of any such\nproperty would need to identify a natural property (or naturalistic\ncondition) as the explanans, where this explanans would be the\nessential nature of the normative property. But if natural properties\nand conditions are not normative, no such thing could be the essential\nnature of the property of being normative.\n\nThese arguments simply raise the issue whether it is correct that no\nnatural property is normative. A utilitarian naturalist might respond\nto the above argument, for example, by claiming that the nature of the\nproperty of failing to maximize the general happiness is such that\nactions with this property are wrong, and, since wrongness is\nessentially normative, normativity is inherent as well in the nature\nof the property failing to maximize the general\nhappiness.\n\nAt the root of all of the objections to normative naturalism is\nperhaps the \u201cJust too Different\u201d objection, the claim that\nnormative properties are just too different in their nature from\nnatural properties for them to be natural properties (Parfit\n2011; Enoch 2011; Copp 2020a). This is an intuitive claim rather than\nan argument. Derek Parfit contends, for example, that the normative\nconcepts rule out naturalism; that wrongness could no more be\nidentical to some natural property than heat could be identical to a\ncabbage (Parfit 2011, vol. II: 325). A naturalist might respond that,\nsimilarly, heat seems to be too different from mean molecular kinetic\nenergy for it to be identical to that, yet the consensus seems to be\nthat heat is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, or\nsomething like that. So \u201cjust too different\u201d intuitions\nare hardly decisive.\n\nIn the next section of this entry, we briefly consider several\nexamples of proposed constitutive explanations of normativity,\nincluding both naturalist explanations and other kinds.\n4. Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity\n\nIn order to explain what normativity consists in, philosophers have\npursued just a few basic strategies. First, it is evident that there\nis a close relationship between normative beliefs and decisions or\nactions, at least when a person is rational. Given this, some theories\npropose a kind of constitutive relationship between normativity and\nmotivation, or between normativity and intentions to act, or between\nnormativity and agency. Second, it has seemed evident to some\nphilosophers that normativity must somehow have a deep psychological\nground if normative demands are not to seem alien to people. So some\ntheories propose that normativity is tied to the essential nature of\npersons as rational, or to what is essential to agency, or at least to\nthe \u201cidentity\u201d of agents, or their \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d. Third, some theories look at the role of normative\nbeliefs in the lives of human beings, in orienting humans to what will\nmake for flourishing lives, or in coordinating and organizing human\nbeings in joint activities in their societies in ways that allow their\nsocieties to flourish.\n\nThis entry will briefly introduce eight kinds of theory. Be aware,\nthat these will be merely sketches of the basic ideas. Note also that\nthe theories are not all intended as examples of reductive normative\nnaturalistic realism. In some cases, the intention is merely to\nilluminate the nature of normativity without achieving a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity. Some of the examples are realist, but some\nare anti-realist, expressivist or constructivist. And among the\nrealist cases are examples of both mind-independent normative realism\nand of basic normative realism. We begin with a perspective on the\nnature of normativity that has been taken to support non-cognitivist\nexpressivism, although it can also be interpreted in a way that is\nfriendly to realism. We then sketch two ideas that are examples of\nbasic-realist approaches, but that eschew mind-independence. They are\nsometimes classified as \u201cconstructivist\u201d and anti-realist.\nIt is not until we reach the final two cases, in\n section 4.7\n and\n section 4.8,\n that we find clear examples of naturalistic constitutive explanations\nof robust normativity that are also examples of mind-independent\nrealism. What follows, then, are eight strategies that have been\nused in attempting to explain normativity.\n4.1 Explaining Normativity via Motivation\n\nOne familiar view is that normative thought has a special, internal,\nconnection to motivation. According to motivational judgment\ninternalism (MJI), it is a necessary truth that a person who believes\nshe ought to do something is motivated accordingly. Generalizing,\nperhaps all normative thoughts are such that, necessarily, a person\nwith a normative thought is thereby motivated accordingly. This\nconnection to motivation arguably must be due to the content of\nnormative beliefs, since not all beliefs have such a close connection\nto motivation. And this suggests an account of normativity. It would\nsay, roughly, that normative propositions are such because,\nnecessarily, anyone who believes such a proposition is motivated\naccordingly.\n\nA different view would invoke the neo-Humean view that no belief\n(properly so called) entails or necessitates motivation; beliefs\nmotivate only when combined with an appropriately related desire. On\nthis view, if moral judgments entail motivation, then moral judgments\nare not (ordinary) beliefs, properly so-called. They must instead be\nat least partly constituted by conative states that do necessarily\nmotivate. In this way, MJI can lead to non-cognitive expressivism.\n\nThe expressivist, Allan Gibbard, has proposed, for example, that\nnormative states of mind are planning states, akin to intentions. To\njudge that it does not make sense to have another Dr. Pepper consists\nin something like planning not to have another Dr. Pepper. Gibbard has\ndeveloped a systematic and sophisticated account to put flesh on this\nbasic idea (Gibbard 2003).\n\nUnfortunately, MJI is controversial and there are a variety of\ncounter-examples and arguments against it (Brink 1989; Copp 2007: chap\n8; Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999; for relevant discussion, see entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external).\n Accordingly, defenders of the basic intuition have qualified and\namended MJI. Michael Smith contends, for example, that it is a\nnecessary truth that a person who believes she ought to do something\nis motivated accordingly unless she is practically irrational (1994).\nHe has also proposed a naturalistic account of what it is to be\npractically rational. His approach lends support to a form of\nnaturalistic normative realism rather than to a form of\nexpressivism.\n4.2 Explaining Normativity via Desire-based reasons\n\nA widespread view is that normative facts are analyzable in terms of\nfacts about reasons. So in this and the next sections, we investigate\nattempts to explain the nature of normativity by explaining the nature\nof reasons.\n\nIt is widely thought that a person has reason to satisfy her desires.\nOn this view, for instance, if I want some ice cream, I have reason to\nget some. Some philosophers hold that all practical reasons are\nbasically of this nature. The basic idea is that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction, but there are different\nversions of the idea. For example, some would insist that the desires\nin question are not necessarily the desires that a person actually\nhas, but are instead ones that she would have if she were fully\ninformed and if she brought all relevant facts vividly to mind (Brandt\n1979). See the entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external.\n\nOne might combine the idea that normative facts are analyzable in\nterms of facts about reasons with the idea that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction. On this basis, one might\nconclude that all normative facts are fundamentally facts about desire\nsatisfaction \u2013 or informed desire satisfaction, or the like. One\nmight then propose that the normativity of a fact consists in its\nbeing analyzable as a fact (of some relevant kind) about desire\nsatisfaction. This then would point the way toward a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of normativity. This basic strategy has been\ndeveloped in detail by Mark Schroeder (2007).\n\nViews of this kind would be classified as realist, if one had in mind\nwhat we earlier called \u201cbasic realism\u201d, or as irrealist or\nanti-realist, if one had in mind what we earlier called\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d. Sharon Street has a view of\nthis kind that she classifies as constructivist (2008, 2010).\n\nOne problem is that our second-order desires can conflict with our\nfirst-order ones. We can desire to get rid of some of our desires, for\nexample, and in this case it might seem that the latter desires\ndon\u2019t give us reason to satisfy them. Following Harry Frankfurt,\none might argue that only desires that are endorsed by higher order\ndesires, or at least not undermined by them, ground reasons (Frankfurt\n1971).\n\nThere are also attempts to undermine these approaches. Christine\nKorsgaard has argued, for example, that one has a reason to satisfy a\ndesire only if the object of the desire is something that is valuable\nitself, or something that will tend to promote something valuable\n(Korsgaard 1996).\n4.3 Explaining Normativity via Practical identity\n\nIt can seem that desires can be too shallow in our psychology to\nground reasons. Christine Korsgaard has suggested that normativity\nmight instead be grounded in our \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d \u2013 in features of ourselves that we value\n(1996). Our practical identity is to be understood as a matter of\nattitudes we take to ourselves and our lives, but it is something more\ncentral to our sense of ourselves than mere desire. On\nKorsgaard\u2019s account, a parent who values parenthood thereby has\nreasons to act as parents are meant to act. Some people have practical\nidentities that are regrettable, of course, such as the practical\nidentity of a gangster. But, Korsgaard argues, a person\u2019s\npractical identity grounds reasons for her only if it is compatible\nwith the practical identities of everyone else.\n\nThe strategy outlined in the preceding section is to take the\nnormativity of a fact to consist in the fact\u2019s being, or being\nanalyzable as, a fact about reasons. One might then take up\nKorsgaard\u2019s account of reasons as facts about practical identity\nand propose that the normativity of a fact consists in the\nfact\u2019s being, or being analyzable as, a suitable fact about\npractical identity.\n\nThis account can still seem to leave too much to a person\u2019s\ncontingent psychology. It would seem to imply that a rootless person\nwho is aimless and untethered has no reasons whatsoever since he has\nno practical identity. He values nothing about his life. Yet,\nplausibly, there are still things he has reason to do and not to\ndo.\n\nThe theory of normativity on offer here might be classified as an\nexample of basic realism, but it isn\u2019t an example of\nmind-independent realism. It tends to be classified as a\nconstructivist and anti-realist (Street 2010).\n4.4 Explaining Normativity via Essential features of agency or action\n\nIt has seemed to some philosophers that a better strategy would be to\nexplain normativity in terms of agency. We are agents, and cannot help\nbut be agents, performing actions (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nDavid Velleman (2000) considers the idea that the key to\nunderstanding normativity in action is to discover what stands to\naction as truth stands to belief. It is constitutive of belief that it\naims at the truth. Truth is normative for belief. That is, roughly,\nbeliefs ought to be true, and a believer is subject to a requirement\nto be responsive to the truth. Similarly, perhaps, it is constitutive\nof action that it aims at the good. The good is normative for action.\nThat is, actions ought to promote the good, and a person who acts is\nsubject to a requirement to be responsive to the good. Velleman\nargues, however, for the different idea that it is constitutive of\nagency that agents have the aim of knowing what they\nare doing. Self-knowledge is the constitutive aim of\naction. Further, Velleman argues, this determines the criterion\nof success in action, which in turn determines which\nconsiderations count as reasons for action.\n\nChristine Korsgaard has proposed (1996), roughly, that in order to\ncount as an action, something done by a person must be done for a\nreason, and this means it must accord with norms that any rational\nagent could accept. Given what actions are, one can act only if one\nacts in accord with such norms.\n\nThese ideas could be interpreted as offering, or at least pointing in\nthe direction of, constitutive accounts of normativity. The basic idea\nwould be that it is constitutive of a fact\u2019s being normative in\nrelation to action or belief that the fact be appropriately related to\nthe essence of action or belief, respectively.\n\nOne response to proposals of these kinds is that, if agency is\nunderstood as these philosophers suggest, then agency is optional.\nThat is, perhaps, a person can opt out of the aim to have\nself-knowledge, or to do things that accord with norms of practical\nreason, by opting to do things that do not count as actions in the\npreferred sense that these proposals spell out. See David Enoch\n(2006).\n\nA different response points out that, on these accounts, the concept\nof action itself turns out to be normative in a covert way, for, on\nthese accounts, it is of the essence of action that it aim at\nself-knowledge, or that it must accord with norms of practical reason.\nBut the idea that an aim is non-optional is arguably\nnormative, as is the idea of norms of practical reason. Hence,\narguably, these accounts do not explain what normativity consists\nin. They rather change the explanandum from the nature of normativity\nto the nature of agency or action.\n4.5 Explaining Normativity via \u201cSelf-legislation\u201d\n\nOne approach, which is suggested by Kant, seeks to explain normativity\nin terms of norms that one could rationally will to serve as\nrequirements incumbent on all agents (1785 [1981]). This can be\ndescribed as a matter of self-legislation, since each person is viewed\nin effect as herself legislating these norms to serve as requirements\non all agents. On this view, as Kantians develop it, the content of\neveryone\u2019s \u201cself-legislation\u201d must be the same,\nassuming relevantly similar circumstances. For the view assumes that\nthere are standards of rational willing that constrain what anyone\ncould will to serve as requirements incumbent on all agents.\n\nWhether such an account can succeed in providing a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity depends on whether the normativity of these\nstandards of rational willing can be given a constitutive explanation.\nFor these standards are viewed as normative constraints on willing,\nand rationality here is taken to be normative. So if the nature of\nnormativity is what we are trying to explain, we haven\u2019t\nsucceeded if our account rests on the assumption that there are\nnormative constraints on willing.\n4.6 Explaining Normativity via Categorical requirements\n\nA similar problem arises for attempts to explain normativity in terms\nof the idea of a categorical requirement of rationality. There is a\nstandardly accepted distinction between hypothetical requirements and\ncategorical ones (Kant 1785 [1981]). Hypothetical requirements\nare, roughly, requirements that are grounded in, or hold in virtue of,\nthe contingent desires or attitudes of the agent who is so required.\nAn example might be the requirement to maintain your car, which\npresumably presupposes that you want your car to continue running.\nCategorical requirements have no such presupposition. It might seem\nthat any genuinely robust normative requirement would be categorical,\nsince all other requirements depend on, and so are hostage to, facts\nabout person\u2019s contingent psychology.\n\nThe challenge is to explain the nature of, and the grounding of, these\ncategorical requirements. If we try to explain this in terms of what\none could rationally will to serve as requirements incumbent on all\nagents, or in terms of what one could rationally will everyone to do,\nwe run up against the same problem as afflicted the account that\ninvokes the idea of self-legislation, which we just discussed. A\nnormative naturalist might propose a naturalistic explanation of\ncategorical requirements but would need to take a very different\napproach (see Copp 2015)\n4.7 Explaining Normativity via Natural function\n\nThere are at least the following two \u201ckinds of goodness\u201d\nthat seem to be naturalistically unproblematic, and, generalizing,\nthere seem to be two kinds of naturalistic normativity. First, where\nK is a functional kind, a good K is one that\nperforms the function well. A good toaster does well at toasting\nbread. A good printer is one that prints well. And the criteria for\nperforming well are naturalistically specifiable in line with the\npurpose of the relevant kind of thing. Second, where K is a\nbiological kind, the things needed by Ks in order to flourish\nare good for Ks. Water and sunlight are good for oak trees,\nfor example. And for a K to flourish is for it to do well at\nliving the kind of life for which it is suited. It is good for a\ncheetah to be able to run fast. It is good for an oak tree to produce\nabundant acorns. These ideas have been used and extended by several\nphilosophers, including Philippa Foot (2001) and Judith Thomson (2008)\nin developing theories of normativity.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward of these theories is Foot\u2019s\nproposal that the virtues of human beings are the general\npsychological properties needed by humans to thrive in living the kind\nof life that we do. Just as it is good for a wolf to be able to fit\ninto the pack, it is good for a human to be sociable \u2013 to be\ncharitable, honest, trustworthy, and so on. For Foot, the virtues are\ngrounded in the distinctive kind of life human beings have, which is\nnot to say they are grounded in our species membership. Any agent that\nlived this kind of life would have the same virtues, regardless of the\nagent\u2019s species. So, for Foot, human goodness is merely\nanalogous to the good for the wolf and the cheetah. For Paul\nBloomfield, however, there is more than merely an analogy. He develops\na theory that is similar to Foot\u2019s, but one that rests on the\nnature of our species and on what members of the species need in order\nto achieve their natural function (2001, 2014, forthcoming).\n\nViews of this kind are examples of mind-independent normative realism\nand of reductive normative naturalism. They can be seen as\nneo-Aristotelian, and they have been developed chiefly, although not\nexclusively, in tandem with virtue theories. For discussion, see\nFitzpatrick 2014 as well as entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology \n and\n virtue ethics.\n\nThere are things to worry about in theories of this kind. If a person\nis thriving even though she does not have the psychological properties\nthat are generally needed in order to thrive, one might think\nshe need have no reason to change. If a person is not living in\ntypical conditions for a human, it is not clear that it would be good\nfor her to have the psychological properties that are\ngenerally needed in order to thrive. This might actually be\nbad for her.\n4.8 Explaining Normativity via Practices well-suited to address problems of normative governance\n\nPeople cannot thrive except with the help of others. We live in\nsocieties, and plausibly we need to do so in order to cope with the\nmany problems and issues we face in meeting our needs and pursuing our\nvalues, as well as to enhance our opportunities, and to allow us to\ndevote time and attention to developing our talents. This means we are\nfaced with a generic problem, the \u201cproblem of sociality\u201d,\nwhich arises because there are sources of conflict and disagreement\nthat can interfere with our ability to live successfully in societies.\nSocieties do better at coping with this generic problem when their\nmembers share a moral code that calls for them to cooperate with one\nanother, to avoid force and fraud, and, generally, and with\nqualifications, not to interfere with one another.\n\nTo the extent that we are autonomous, in a familiar sense of that\nterm, we pursue what we need, and we aim to realize our values. Yet\neach of us has a tendency to fail to be resolute in this pursuit, to\nsuccumb to temptation by immediate pleasures, to fail to give enough\nweight to future goods or to present risks. This is a generic problem,\nthe \u201cproblem of autonomy\u201d, and we do better at coping with\nit if we subscribe to a standard or a norm requiring us, roughly, to\nefficiently pursue what we need and value. If our psychology and our\nstrivings are well regulated by such a norm, we are\n\u201crational\u201d, and we enhance our autonomy.\n\nIn both of these cases, and others, there is a generic problem that we\ndo better at coping with if we (or enough of us) subscribe to norms or\nstandards with a content well-suited to addressing the problem.\nPluralist teleology begins with this idea and uses it, first, to\ndevelop an account of the truth conditions of normative propositions\nof morality (Copp 2007, 2009), prudential rationality (Copp 2007: chap\n10), and epistemology (Copp 2014), and second, to develop an account\nof normativity (Copp 2015). This account says, roughly, that normative\nfacts of a given kind are grounded in the content of the system of\nstandards that would best address the corresponding problem of\nnormative governance. This view is another example of mind-independent\nnormative realism and of reductive normative naturalism.\n\nThere are things to worry about. One might worry that this approach\nseems unable to make sense of the idea that, when morality and\nprudential rationality come into conflict, there might be something\nthat one ought to do \u201call-things-considered\u201d (Copp 2020c).\nOne might also worry that normativity is smuggled into the rankings of\nnorms on the basis of how well-suited they are to enabling us to cope\nwith a problem of normative governance. If so, the account might not\nbe a successful constitutive explanation of normativity. One might\nalso worry that the view implies that it is a contingent matter\nwhether certain unsettling moral claims are true (Copp 2020b).\n4.9 Conclusion\n\nEach of these eight strategies for explaining normativity has of\ncourse been contested. In cases in which the explanans uses\nnormative concepts, there is the objection that the account\ndoesn\u2019t explain normativity as such, but only reduces\nnormativity to one variety of normative consideration. In cases where\nthe explanans does not use normative concepts, there is the\npotential to provide an analysis of what normativity consists in.\nHowever, of course, every putative analysis invites objections. And,\nin every case where the putative analysis is substantive and\nphilosophically interesting, it can be denied with some\nplausibility.\n\nA familiar challenge is the \u201cso what\u201d challenge. So what\nif this act is required by the system of norms best suited to address\nthe problem of sociality, what is that to me? So what if sustaining my\npractical identity requires this act; what is that to me if doing this\nact would involve a great sacrifice? So what if my agency in a special\nprivileged sense depends on my performing this act; why should I care\nabout being an agent in this sense?\n\nIt is no accident that this all-purpose objection bears a family\nresemblance to Moore\u2019s open question argument. And the best\nresponses to it are similar to familiar responses to Moore. A\nsubstantive analysis of a philosophically interesting concept would\nnot be informative if it were obviously correct. And nothing\nguarantees that the best analysis of a philosophically interesting\nconcept will be obviously correct. Further, a metaphysical analysis of\nwhat the normativity of a worldly property or state of affairs could\nconsist in is not likely to be a priori. The more informative\nand interesting a putative analysis is, the less likely it is that it\nwill seem obviously correct, so the more it will seem open to\nobjection. (See entries on\n analysis\n and\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n5. Is Normativity Mind-Dependent?\n\nMany of the views just canvassed share a common theme: normativity is\nexplained in terms of the mental states, events, or attitudes of\nindividuals or collections of individuals. (We\u2019ll call these\n\u201cmental states\u201d for short.) Many other\nviews \u2013 including some of those just canvassed \u2013 think that\nthere is some important sense in which the normative facts are\nindependent of mental states. This debate can be (and often\nhas been) traced back all the way to the Euthyphro, where\nSocrates considers whether what is pious is determined by what the\ngods love, or whether it\u2019s the other way around (see Berker\n2018; Wright 1992). This debate has come to be known as the debate\nover the mind-dependence of normativity. Normative realists\nhave generally been taken to be committed to mind-independence (see,\ne.g., Shafer-Landau 2003; McGrath 2010; Enoch 2011), although we have\nattempted to remain neutral on this point by distinguishing\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d from \u201cbasic\nrealism\u201d, which is compatible with mind-dependence (see Cuneo\n2007).\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll cover arguments for and against the\nmind-dependence of the normative. But before we get there, we need to\nanswer a framing question: what precisely are we talking\nabout when we talk about the mind-dependence of the normative?\nAbove we framed this as the question of whether normativity is\nexplained in terms of mental states. But as we\u2019ll see below,\nthat formulation is not entirely clear.\n5.1 What is Mind-Dependence?\n\nFirst, what is the important scope of mind-dependence? Is the\nimportant question whether some normative facts are\nmind-dependent, or whether all such facts are? We think it is\nthe latter. Mark Schroeder claims, with regard to reasons in\nparticular, that it is uncontroversial that some reasons\nare explained by mental states \u2013 Ronnie has a reason to go to the\ndance because he loves to dance, but Bradley has a reason to avoid the\ndance because he hates dancing. What would be controversial\nis the idea that all reasons are explained by mental states;\nthis is actually entailed by Schroeder\u2019s \u201cHumean\u201d\nview of reasons (Schroeder 2007). We agree that the interesting\nquestion is whether all normative facts are mind-dependent,\nor whether, instead, some are mind-independent.\n\nWe also note, however, that there could be important questions about\nthe mind-independence of distinct normative subdomains. For example,\nthere are the questions whether all moral facts are\nmind-dependent, whether all aesthetic facts are\nmind-independent, etc.\n\nSecond, it would be good to get a clearer idea of what kind of\ndependence is involved in mind-dependence. In brief, we are going to\ntry to be as ecumenical as possible, not tying mind-dependence to any\nnarrowly defined or parochial metaphysical relation. Rather,\nmind-dependence concerns broad metaphysical dependence on the mental.\nThis is for two reasons: first, this just seems to us to be what\nimportant debate in the vicinity is about. It\u2019s not as if\nmind-dependence concerns metaphysical constitution by the mental,\nrather than reduction. Certainly advocates of the view that wrongness\nis constituted by disapproval disagree on some points with\nthose who think that wrongness reduces to disapproval. But in\ngeneral they seem to agree on an important point: that the there is\nsome kind of robust metaphysical dependence of wrongness on some\nmental state. It is our sense that this agreed-upon claim is what is\nat stake in debates about mind-dependence.\n\nThe second reason to define mind-dependence ecumenically is that this\nis the best way of making sense of the extant literature. Sharon\nStreet\u2019s body of work is an example. She describes her position\nas committing her to mind-dependence (Street 2016: 298n). But she\ndescribes it differently in different places: she writes (2012) that\nnormative truth consists in what follows from within the\npractical point of view; or (2008) that normative facts are\nconstituted by facts about the agent\u2019s judgments; she\n(2016) characterizes mind-dependence views at those on which\n\u201cthings [are] valuable ultimately because we value\nthem\u201d (emphasis added). So we should understand the defining\nrelation of mind-dependence so that it encompasses all of these\nrelations. Below, we will call this generic relation\n\u201cgrounding\u201d, for simplicity. This term is\nimperfect \u2013 grounding has become intensely theorized and\ndisputed \u2013 but we use it as a stand-in for a broad kind of\nmetaphysical dependence.\n\nFinally, we think that the relevant notion of mind-dependence rules\nout there being mind-independent normative constraints on the kinds of\nmental states that can ground normative facts. A few examples will\nexplain what we mean. Take the view that what we have reason to do is\ngrounded in what an ideally rational agent in our situation would want\nto do, where rationality is an irreducibly normative property. Or take\nthe view that value is grounded in being the appropriate object of an\nattitude such as admiration, where appropriateness is irreducibly\nnormative. Both views ground some significant set of normative facts\nin mental facts, but they also entail that other normative facts\n(facts about rationality and appropriateness, respectively) are\nnot grounded in mental states. Such views do not, on our\nreckoning, count as mind-dependent, for two reasons. First, we have\nestablished that the important question about mind-dependence is\nwhether all normative facts are mind-dependent, and these\nviews are views on which some aren\u2019t. Second, and most\nimportant, the relevant normative facts are partly grounded in other\nnormative facts that are themselves not grounded in mental\nfacts: facts about rationality or appropriateness are in the grounds,\nwhere these facts explicitly do not \u201cground out\u201d in mental\nfacts.\n\nThis leaves us, so far, with the claim that mind-dependence views are\nthose that fully ground all normative facts (or some significant\nsubset thereof) in mental facts. Yet as we\u2019ll see, even this\nformulation leaves some problems.\n\nMany have worried that the debate over mind-dependence is not a\nsignificant one. Gideon Rosen (1994) argued that the notion of\nmind-independence does not track our intuitive notion of objectivity.\nHis arguments often take the form: X-facts are a paradigm example of\nmind-dependent facts, but they depend on Y-facts, and Y-facts seem\nperfectly real and objective even though they are obviously mind\ndependent. Facts about humor, for example, may depend on what humans\nfind funny \u2013 but facts about what humans find funny are perfectly\nobjective! Other of his arguments take the form: X-facts are clearly\nobjective, but they depend on mental facts, and so are mind-dependent.\nFacts about fox terriers, for example depend causally on the\nintentions of those who bred them \u2013 but surely facts about fox\nterriers are objective!\n\nRuss Shafer-Landau points to a different kind of problem: mundane\nfirst-order normative truths depend on mental facts. Thus, if\nparticular normative facts are mind-dependent just when they depend on\nmental facts, and if we don\u2019t distinguish kinds of dependence,\nit looks like many mundane first-order claims commit one to the\nmind-dependence of the relevant particular normative fact:\n\n\nWe obviously can\u2019t enter a moral assessment of an agent\u2019s\nmotivations and intentions without recourse to what is going on in her\nmind. And the moral status of an action may depend very importantly on\nhow pleased or miserable it makes others, whether it prompts feelings\nof anger or empathy, whether one who is harmed has given his consent\nto the treatment, etc. (2003: 15)\n\n\nThis problem has been discussed by, for example, Enoch (2011:\n2\u20133), Rosati (2018), and Morton (forthcoming). The problem is\nthat mind-dependence is not something that should be an entailment of\nmundane first-order moral claims that, presumably, would be accepted\nby theorists on both sides of the debate about mind-dependence.\n\nAs it stands, this problem can be solved by appeal to our earlier\nclarification: the claim worth arguing about is whether all\nnormative facts (or at least all moral facts) are mind-dependent. As\nlong as there are some moral facts that don\u2019t depend on mental\nfacts, Shafer-Landau\u2019s point shouldn\u2019t worry us.\n\nThere is, however, a related, although perhaps more subtle point, that\narises for certain ethical theories. Utilitarianism, for example,\nentails that all particular moral facts depend on mental facts about\nhappiness and unhappiness. This means that \u2013 assuming a normative\nfact is mind-dependent just when it depends on mental\nfacts \u2013 utilitarianism is by definition a theory on which all\nparticular moral facts are mind-dependent. (The theory does not imply\nthat the fact that it itself is true is mind-dependent.) But surely it\nwould be a mistake to think that utilitarianism implies that all\nparticular moral facts are mind-dependent in the sense at issue in\nmeta-ethical debate about realism! And utilitarianism is not unique.\nMany other moral theories hold that that which makes right actions\nright (and good actions good, etc.) is purely mental. Consider a view\non which all moral evaluations depend on the intentions of the actor,\nfor example. So we need a solution to this puzzle \u2013 an account of\nthe nature of mind-dependence (in the sense relevant to the\nmeta-ethical debate) that doesn\u2019t commit such theories one way\nor the other on whether particular moral facts are mind-dependent (in\nthat sense).\n\nThis is a puzzle about the very notion of mind-dependence. One\nsolution would be Shafer-Landau\u2019s (2003: 15): he suggests that\nmind-dependence is ultimately a matter of how \u201cthe moral\nstandards that fix the moral facts\u201d are \u201cmade true\u201d.\nWe could parlay this into a general account of the mind-dependence of\nnormative facts in the following way: a particular normative fact is\nmind-dependent when the normative principle that governs its grounding\nin the non-normative is mind-dependent. And a principle is\nmind-dependent when it is grounded in mental facts. This solution\nallows mundane first-order claims to make no commitment on the issue\nof mind-dependence. The important question regarding the\nmind-dependence of a particular normative fact will be what explains\nor grounds the connection between, for example, causing\nunhappiness and being wrong. For example, is the principle of utility\nonly true because I believe it or because of some other mental fact?\nIf so, the principle is mind-dependent, and this mind-dependence is\ninherited by the fact that my act is wrong.\n\nAnother way to solve the problem would be to be pluralists about the\nkinds of mind-dependence that could be relevant. Fine (2012)\nsuggested, in a broader context, that metaphysical grounding is\nfundamentally distinct from normative grounding. So perhaps when\nutilitarianism says the moral depends on the mental, it means that it\nnormatively depends on the mental, while the meta-ethical\ndebate about mind-dependence (about the moral) concerns the claim that\nthe moral metaphysically depends on the mental. This is a\nsuggestion that has not been fully explored yet (though it is\ndiscussed in Berker (2018), Enoch (2019) and Morton\n(forthcoming)).\n\nEither proposal would solve the problem with utilitarianism. If\nmind-dependence (in the sense relevant to the meta-ethical debate\nabout realism) is a matter of whether normative principles are\ngrounded in mental facts, then utilitarians are free (as far as their\nutilitarianism goes) to endorse either the mind-dependence or the\nmind-independence of the moral. Utilitarianism just says that the\nparticular moral facts are grounded in mental facts, but does\nnot commit one way or the other on the grounding of the Principle of\nUtility. Similarly, if mind-dependence is a matter of\nmetaphysical (as opposed to normative) grounding of\nparticular facts in the mental, then utilitarianism can (and should)\nbe read as the claim that moral facts are normatively\ngrounded in happiness facts. Utilitarianism is silent on the further\nclaim that moral facts are metaphysically grounded in\nhappiness facts (or any mental facts whatsoever), which leaves it open\nto the utilitarian to either affirm or deny the mind-dependence of\nmoral facts \u2013 i.e., to either affirm or deny mind-independent\nmoral realism.\n\nThe puzzles around mind-dependence remain not fully explored, and it\nseems to us that more work is needed here. Nevertheless, we will press\non now to consider arguments for and against the mind-dependence of\nthe normative (or in some cases, the moral in particular). For\nsimplicity, however, we will continue to talk about mind-dependence as\nconcerning whether normative facts are grounded in mental facts. We\nwill not attempt to cash this out in terms of either or both of the\nabove more nuanced accounts.\n5.2 Arguments for Mind-Dependence\n\nWe will cover four main arguments for the mind-dependence of (some\nsignificant subdomain of) the normative. The first is an\nepistemological argument. The general form of that argument is as\nfollows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nBut we do have substantive normative\nknowledge.\nTherefore, normative facts are mind-dependent.\n\n\nThe \u201csubstantive\u201d qualifier is here because, even\naccording to those who embrace\n premise (1),\n we could have knowledge of \u201cnon-substantive\u201d claims such\nas \u201cEither Bob\u2019s act was wrong or it wasn\u2019t\u201d.\nDefining substantiveness more precisely is hard, but we could focus on\nthe important case of (knowledge of) atomic normative truths.\n\nPremise (2)\n of the argument is taken as given by those who advance this argument,\nbut of course some would deny it.\n Premise (1)\n might seem strange, since we have substantive knowledge of many kinds\nof facts that surely are mind-independent, such as facts about the\nstars. But (1) is intended as a claim specifically about knowledge of\nnormative facts. The claim is that there is something about the\nnormative such that we could not have knowledge of facts of\nthis kind if they were mind-independent. The claim has been\nsupported in a variety of ways. Some have followed Benacerraf and\nField\u2019s formulation of a problem for mathematical Platonism\n(Benacerraf 1973 and Field 1989). Enoch (2011: ch. 7) and Setiya\n(2012: ch. 2) both take this to be a main epistemological worry for\nrealism. The argument is roughly that if normative facts were\nmind-independent, there would be no explanation of the reliability of\nour substantive normative beliefs \u2013 which would undermine our\nsubstantive normative knowledge. Some think that there could be no\nsuch explanation because normative facts do not (and cannot) cause\nanything. It is controversial, however, whether normative facts ever\nhave causal impact on anything. (See sec 3.2 of entry on\n moral skepticism\n and the extensive literature on moral explanations, including Harman\n1977 and Sturgeon 1985.)\n\nOf far more popularity recently are evolutionary debunking arguments\n(or \u201cEDAs\u201d), which aim to establish (1) by way of\ngenealogical arguments. (However, see White (2010) for discussion of\nnon-evolutionary genealogical arguments.) The basic form of an EDA is\nas follows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent and evolution\nhad influenced our normative faculties in such-and-such a way, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nEvolution has influenced our normative faculties in\nsuch-and-such a way.\nTherefore, if normative facts were mind-independent,\nthen we would not have substantive normative knowledge.\n\n\nSharon Street (2006), Richard Joyce (2006: ch. 6), and Allan Gibbard\n(2003: ch. 13) all present early versions of this argument, though it\nhas spawned an extensive literature. The argument is typically aimed\nat moral realism, but it is clear that mind-independence is the tenet\nof realism that is supposed to be causing the problem. (This is\nexplicit in various places, e.g., Street 2006: 110). However, it could\ncertainly be argued that it is not mind-independence in general that\ncauses the problem, but non-naturalistic views in particular (see the\ndebate between Street 2008 and Copp 2008). We\u2019ll put that debate\naside for now and present the argument according to most of its\nproponents\u2019 view of it \u2013 that it targets mind-independence\nin general.\n\nDifferent kinds of support have been offered for the first premise of\nthe EDA \u2013 it could be that mind-independence and evolutionary\ninfluence would mean it would be a huge coincidence if our\nnormative beliefs were true, and that fact undermines our normative\nknowledge. (Street 2006; see also Bedke 2014, though Bedke\u2019s\nobjection is against non-naturalism in particular). Or perhaps\nevolution would mean that beliefs about mind-independent normative\nfacts would be insensitive: we would have those beliefs\nregardless of whether they were true. Shafer-Landau (2012) presents a\ngood overview of different arguments here.\n\nA third argument for mind-dependence relies on claims about the nature\nof reasons. Bernard Williams (1979) famously argued that in order to\nhave a normative reason to act, I must have some motive that will be\nfurthered by my so acting. This has been called \u201creasons\ninternalism\u201d. Humean theories of reasons claim that in order to\nhave a reason to act, I must have some desire that is furthered by so\nacting. Such claims are mere necessitation claims, but could be\nleveraged as an argument for mind-dependence. For, one might claim,\nthe fact that having a relevant desire is a necessary condition of\nhaving a reason could be easily explained on the basis that\nreasons \u2013 or the relevant domain of normative facts \u2013 are\ngrounded in or explained by the relevant motives or\ndesires, as in Schroeder (2007). (Of course, this superficial reading\nwould have to be more nuanced based on our reading of the nature of\nthe mind-dependence debate.) Mind-independence theories of reasons, it\ncould be argued, have a harder time explaining reasons internalism, or\nHumean theories of reasons.\n\nFinally, some have argued against the mind-independence of the moral\nby appeal to fundamental moral disagreements. These are moral\ndisagreements that would survive some set of idealizing conditions\nlike full non-normative information and full rationality. Mackie\n(1977) himself thought that moral disagreement undermined the\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d of morality \u2013 which, for our purposes,\ncan be equated with mind-independence \u2013 but because Mackie thought\nmoral talk was committed to objectivity, he concluded that there are\nno moral facts. Michael Smith (1994: 6) argues that if moral facts are\nobjective, then moral opinions should converge under ideal conditions:\nthus fundamental moral disagreement would undermine objectivity.\n\nMind-independence theorists could accept this and argue that\nfundamental moral disagreement is not actual or possible (depending on\nwhether the objection is about actual or merely possible fundamental\ndisagreement). Alternatively, mind-independence theorists could deny\nthat fundamental moral disagreement undermines mind-independence\n(Shafer-Landau 2003: ch 9; McGrath 2010). They could point out that\nthere is fundamental disagreement in other domains, such as physics or\nhistory, yet we do not take this to undermine objectivity-claims in\nthose domains. But some, such as Richard Rowland (2017), argue that\nmoral disagreement is relevantly different from disagreement in other\ndomains.\n5.3 Arguments for Mind-Independence\n\nWe will consider two main arguments for the mind-independence of the\nnormative. First is a recent argument by David Enoch for the\nmind-independence of morality (2011: ch. 2). Enoch argues that when we\nare in certain kinds of interpersonal conflict with someone else, to\nthe extent that that conflict is due to preferences, or attitudes, or\ndesires (etc.), we should not stand our ground but should stand back\nfrom our own position and seek some sort of impartial, egalitarian\nsolution to the conflict. For example, if two friends want to do\nsomething fun, and one wants to go to the movies while the other wants\nto play video games, neither should insist on their position over the\nother\u2019s without budging. (Maybe they should flip a coin.) Enoch\ncalls this constraint \u201cImpartiality\u201d.\n\nYet, Enoch argues, this entails that on many mind-dependence theories,\nwe should find a way of compromising in the same way, when we have a\nmoral disagreement. This is easiest to see on the view that our moral\njudgments simply report mental states, which Enoch calls\n\u201cCaricatured Subjectivism\u201d. On Caricatured Subjectivism,\nour moral disagreements just are disagreements about mental\nstates, and so should be governed by Impartiality. Enoch argues that\nthe same result follows on any theory that grounds moral truth in\nmental states: on such views, we ought to find some way of\ncompromising when we have a moral disagreement.\n\nThis, Enoch argues, is a morally odious entailment: in many moral\ndisagreements, it is not only permissible but required that\nwe stand our ground. Imagine \u2013 to use Enoch\u2019s\ncase \u2013 disagreeing with someone about whether a dog\u2019s pain\ncounts, morally speaking. And imagine you then have to decide on a\nparticular case, for example, on whether to cause a dog serious pain,\nabout which you also disagree. Should you split the difference and\ncause just a small amount of pain, or flip a coin, or pursue some\nother compromise? No, Enoch argues: you should stand your ground. In\nthis way, moral disagreements are analogous to (non-moral) factual\ndisagreements and unlike conflicts of conative attitudes.\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument has its limitations, as he admits. His argument\nassumes that, on a given mind-dependence view, when two agents\ndisagree morally, their disagreement reduces to or is relevantly\nanalogous to a disagreement of conative attitudes. But if you have a\nview on which all moral agents necessarily share certain attitudes,\nthus entailing that certain moral truths are necessary, then all or at\nleast many moral disagreements will not be relevantly analogous to a\ndisagreement of conative attitudes. Hence mind-dependence views of\nthese kinds avoid Enoch\u2019s objection since his argument does not\nshow that disagreements, as understood by such theories, are governed\nby Impartiality. (Similarly, cultural relativism, \u201cno\npriority\u201d views, and any view which gives an irreducibly\nnormative constraint on which mental states can ground moral facts,\nalso avoid Enoch\u2019s objection, according to Enoch.)\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument also has the limitation that it only applies to\nmorality, rather than mind-dependence views of normativity in general.\nThis limitation appears on the face of the argument, since it relies\non the premise that it is morally objectionable not to stand\nour ground in some moral disagreements. It does not seem\nequally objectionable in any sense to compromise in cases of\nepistemic, or aesthetic, or prudential disagreements (though maybe the\ncase could be made in some or all of these domains).\n\nA second argument, or class of arguments, depends on what Sharon\nStreet (2009) calls ideally coherent eccentrics (ICEs):\ncharacters who have some intuitively bad motive (or desire, or belief,\netc.) that survives some idealization process. What process is\nrelevant will depend on the particular mind-dependence view under\nconsideration, but the idea is that some ICEs will survive any\nplausible idealization process. Generally, we can say that they have\nsome objectionable mental state that coheres both with their other\nrelevant mental states, and with the non-normative facts. The outcome,\nin abstract terms, is that for any given view of normativity\nV on which normative fact N for agent A is\nfully grounded in mental fact M, there is some ICE for whom\nM obtains, and thus N obtains for that ICE on\nV, but it is intuitively clear that N does\nnot obtain for that ICE. So we should reject V.\n\nThe strategy can be illustrated by a concrete example. Allan Gibbard\ntalks about the infamously cruel Roman emperor Caligula, and imagines\nthat he wants to torture for fun while harboring no conflicting\nattitudes (1990: 145). The argument is, then, that Caligula plainly\nwould be wrong to torture just for fun despite the fact that his\ndesire to torture for fun is coherent with his other attitudes and\nresistant to change under any idealization process. So the wrongness\nof his torturing for fun is not grounded in his actual attitudes nor\nis it grounded in the attitudes of his that would survive some\nidealization process.\n\nThe argument from ICEs has some shortcomings. First, it seems only to\nstrike against theories according to which specific moral facts\nconcerning specific agents are grounded in the attitudes or idealized\nattitudes of those agents. Second, recall that, for reasons we\nexplained before, we take the debate about mind-dependence to concern\nwhether normative principles are fully metaphysically\ngrounded in mental facts. The example of Caligula, and similar\nexamples found in Parfit (2011: ch 2, sec 11), Williams (1989 [1995:\n39]) and Hume (1739\u201340: Book 2, Part 3), are not on point, for\nthey all concern an agent with a specific mental profile and a\nspecific moral claim involving that agent. The interesting question is\nwhether we can use the basic idea of ICEs to develop analogous\nobjections to views that fully ground normative principles in mental\nfacts.\n\nMind-dependence theories differ from one another in various ways. Yet\nthe ICE strategy can perhaps be modified in ways that would allow it\nto strike against a wider variety of mind-dependence theories, and\nperhaps against all such theories. For example, ICE strategy is on its\nface not aimed at views like cultural relativism, which would\nnevertheless still count as a mind-dependence view on our definition.\nBut we can easily conceive of ICE-analogues at the cultural level:\nassume the relevant relativistic view is that moral facts for\nA are grounded what A\u2019s culture believes. We\ncan imagine A\u2019s culture believing, without internal\ninconsistency, that genocide is morally commendable \u2013 but it\nclearly is not. Again, the ideally coherent Caligula wants to torture\nfor fun and has no conflicting desires. This will entail that he has a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun on the view that decisive reasons\nare grounded in desires (at least when those desires don\u2019t\nconflict with any others). Or take the view that believing one has\na reason to X engenders a reason for one to X.\nWe can then imagine that Caligula believes he has a reason to torture\nfor fun. Combining this particular mind-dependence view with the\nmodified Caligula example entails that Caligula has a reason to\ntorture for fun. Nothing seems to suggest that any particular\nmind-dependence view is going to escape criticism. And,\nmind-independence proponents will argue, the only way we can account\nfor the facts that Caligula is wrong to torture for fun and lacks a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun is by allowing that some normative\nfacts are fully mind-independent.\n\nIt is open to any given mind-dependence theory to argue that it does\nnot have the morally objectionable entailment suggested in\nthe ICE argument. Perhaps the theory could argue that it\u2019s\nimpossible for the relevant mental state not to be in conflict with\nother relevant mental states, or the non-normative facts \u2013 maybe,\nthat is, it is impossible for the ideally coherent eccentric\nin question to exist. On the other hand, mind-dependence theorists\ncould argue, as Sharon Street (2009) does, that the ICE could exist,\nand that the relevant normative entailments do obtain \u2013 but that\nthey are not problematic. That is, for instance, perhaps the ideal\nCaligula really does have a reason to torture for fun\n\nMind-dependence theorists could try to take the edge off these\nentailments. Taking the case of reasons as an example, they could\nargue, as Williams (1989 [1995: 39]) suggested, that even though, on\nWilliams\u2019s theory, a cruel husband might have no reason to be\nnicer to his wife, we can still say that he is \u201cungrateful,\ninconsiderate, hard, sexist, nasty, selfish, brutal, and many other\ndisadvantageous things\u201d. Of course, this strategy depends on\neach of those properties not entailing that someone with that\nproperty has a reason to try to avoid it. This is tenuous at best: it\nseems doubtful at the very least to say that we have no reason to\navoid being ungrateful or sexist, etc.\n\nThe mind-dependence theorist can also consistently say that, even if\nthe ICE lacks the reasons in question, we can nevertheless force him\ninto therapy, or help his wife leave him, or try to have him arrested\n(Manne 2014). These actions don\u2019t require that the cruel husband\nhave any reasons whatsoever, but depend only on what the sympathetic\nonlooker or the wife has reason to do. But some will still find this\nunsatisfying: the husband shouldn\u2019t be acting the way\nhe is. And, of course, here the mind-independence theorist is happy to\nadvertise the benefit she can offer: the husband has a reason to treat\nhis wife better no matter what\u2019s going on in his head (or his\nheart).",
