Modal Axioms and Conditions on Frames\n\nOne might assume from this discussion that \\(\\bK\\) is the correct\nlogic when \\(\\Box\\) is read \u2018it will always be the case\nthat\u2019. However, there are reasons for thinking that \\(\\bK\\) is\ntoo weak. One obvious logical feature of the relation \\(R\\) (earlier\nthan) is transitivity. If \\(wRv\\) (\\(w\\) is earlier than \\(v)\\) and\n\\(vRu\\) (\\(v\\) is earlier than \\(u)\\), then it follows that \\(wRu\\)\n(\\(w\\) is earlier than \\(u)\\). So let us define a new kind of validity\nthat corresponds to this condition on \\(R\\). Let a 4-model be any\nmodel whose frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is such that \\(R\\) is a\ntransitive relation on \\(W\\). Then an argument is 4-valid iff any\n4-model whose valuation assigns \\(T\\) to the premises at a world also\nassigns \\(T\\) to the conclusion at the same world. We use\n\u20184\u2019 to describe such a transitive model because the logic\nwhich is adequate (both sound and complete) for 4-validity is\n\\(\\mathbf{K4}\\), the logic which results from adding the axiom (4):\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A\\) to \\(\\bK\\).\n\nTransitivity is not the only property which we might want to require\nof the frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) if \\(R\\) is to be read\n\u2018earlier than\u2019 and \\(W\\) is a set of moments. One\ncondition (which is only mildly controversial) is that there is no\nlast moment of time, i.e. that for every world \\(w\\) there is some\nworld \\(v\\) such that \\(wRv\\). This condition on frames is called\nseriality. Seriality corresponds to the axiom \\((D): \\Box\nA\\rightarrow \\Diamond A\\), in the same way that transitivity\ncorresponds to (4). A \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-model is a \\(\\bK\\)-model with a\nserial frame. From the concept of a \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-model the\ncorresponding notion of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-validity can be defined just as\nwe did in the case of 4-validity. As you probably guessed, the system\nthat is adequate with respect to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-validity is\n\\(\\mathbf{KD}\\), or \\(\\bK\\) plus \\((D)\\). Not only that, but the\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{KD4}\\) (that is \\(\\bK\\) plus (4) and \\((D))\\) is\nadequate with respect to \\(\\mathbf{D4}\\)-validity, where a\n\\(\\mathbf{D4}\\)-model is one where \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is\nboth serial and transitive.\n\nAnother property which we might want for the relation \u2018earlier\nthan\u2019 is density, the condition which says that between any two\ntimes we can always find another. Density would be false if time were\natomic, i.e. if there were intervals of time which could not be broken\ndown into any smaller parts. Density corresponds to the axiom \\((C4):\n\\Box \\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box A\\), the converse of (4), so for example,\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{KC4}\\), which is \\(\\bK\\) plus \\((C4)\\) is\nadequate with respect to models where the frame \\(\\langle W,\nR\\rangle\\) is dense, and \\(\\mathbf{KDC4}\\) is adequate with respect to\nmodels whose frames are serial and dense, and so on.\n\nEach of the modal logic axioms we have discussed corresponds to a\ncondition on frames in the same way. The relationship between\nconditions on frames and corresponding axioms is one of the central\ntopics in the study of modal logics. Once an interpretation of the\nintensional operator \\(\\Box\\) has been decided on, the appropriate\nconditions on \\(R\\) can be determined to fix the corresponding notion\nof validity. This, in turn, allows us to select the right set of\naxioms for that logic.\n\nFor example, consider a deontic logic, where \\(\\Box\\) is read\n\u2018it is obligatory that\u2019. Here the truth of \\(\\Box A\\) does\nnot demand the truth of \\(A\\) in every possible world, but\nonly in a subset of those worlds where people do what they ought. So\nwe will want to introduce a relation \\(R\\) for this kind of logic as\nwell, and use the truth clause \\((K)\\) to evaluate \\(\\Box A\\) at a\nworld. However, in this case, \\(R\\) is not earlier than. Instead\n\\(wRw'\\) holds just in case world \\(w'\\) is a morally acceptable\nvariant of \\(w\\), i.e. a world that our actions can bring about which\nsatisfies what is morally correct, or right, or just. Under such a\nreading, it should be clear that the relevant frames should obey\nseriality, the condition that requires that each possible world have a\nmorally acceptable variant. The analysis of the properties desired for\n\\(R\\) makes it clear that a basic deontic logic can be formulated by\nadding the axiom \\((D)\\) and to \\(\\bK\\).\n\nEven in modal logic, one may wish to restrict the range of possible\nworlds which are relevant in determining whether \\(\\Box A\\) is true at\na given world. For example, I might say that it is necessary that I\npay my bills, even though I know full well that there is a possible\nworld where I fail to pay them. In ordinary speech, the claim that\n\\(A\\) is necessary does not require the truth of \\(A\\) in all\npossible worlds, but rather only in a certain class of worlds which I\nhave in mind (for example, worlds where I avoid penalties for failure\nto pay). In order to provide a generic treatment of necessity, we must\nsay that \\(\\Box A\\) is true in \\(w\\) iff \\(A\\) is true in all worlds\nthat are related to \\(w\\) in the right way. So for an\noperator \\(\\Box\\) interpreted as necessity, we introduce a\ncorresponding relation \\(R\\) on the set of possible worlds \\(W\\),\ntraditionally called the accessibility relation. The accessibility\nrelation \\(R\\) holds between worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) iff \\(w'\\) is\npossible given the facts of \\(w\\). Under this reading for \\(R\\), it\nshould be clear that frames for modal logic should be reflexive. It\nfollows that modal logics should be founded on \\(M\\), the system that\nresults from adding \\((M)\\) to \\(\\bK\\). Depending on exactly how the\naccessibility relation is understood, symmetry and transitivity may\nalso be desired.\n\nA list of some of the more commonly discussed conditions on frames and\ntheir corresponding axioms along with a map showing the relationship\nbetween the various modal logics can be found in the next section.\n",
