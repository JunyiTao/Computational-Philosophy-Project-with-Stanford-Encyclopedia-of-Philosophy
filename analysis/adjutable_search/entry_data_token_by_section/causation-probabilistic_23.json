    "main_text": "Actual Causation\n4. Actual Causation\n\nMany philosophers and legal theorists have been interested in the\nrelation of actual causation. This concerns the assignment of\ncausal responsibility for an event, based on how events actually play\nout. For example, suppose that Billy and Suzy each throw a rock at a\nbottle, and that each has a certain probability of hitting and\nbreaking it. As it happens, Suzy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, and\nBilly\u2019s doesn\u2019t. As things actually happened, we would say\nthat Suzy\u2019s throw caused the bottle to shatter, while\nBilly\u2019s didn\u2019t. Nonetheless, Billy\u2019s throw increased\nthe probability that the bottle would shatter, and it would be\nidentified as a cause by the theories described in sections\n 2\n and\n 3.\n Billy\u2019s throw had a tendency to shatter the bottle; it was a\npotential cause of the bottle shattering; it was the sort of thing\nthat generally causes shattering; but it did not actually cause the\nbottle to shatter. \n\nA number of authors have attempted to provide probabilistic analyses\nof actual causation. Some, such as Eells (1991: chapter 6), Kvart\n(1997, 2004), and Glynn\n(2011), pay careful attention to the way in which probabilities change\nover time. Some, such as Dowe (2004) and Schaffer (2001), combine\nprobabilities with the resources of a process theory of causation.\nSome, such as Lewis (1986b), Menzies (1989), and Noordhof (1999),\nemploy probabilities together with counterfactuals to analyze actual\ncausation. And others such as Beckers & Vennekens (2016),\nFenton-Glynn (2017), Halpern (2016: Section 2.5), Hitchcock (2004a),\nand Twardy & Korb (2011) employ causal modeling tools similar to\nthose described in\n Section 3.\n We will describe two of those theories\u2014Lewis (1986b) and\nFenton-Glynn (2017)\u2014in more detail in sections\n 4.3\n and\n 4.4\n below. \n",
