    "preamble": "\n\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 was a mathematician, theoretical physicist and a\nphilosopher of science famous for discoveries in several fields and\nreferred to as the last polymath, one who could make significant\ncontributions in multiple areas of mathematics and the physical\nsciences. This survey will focus on Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nphilosophy. Concerning Poincar\u00e9\u2019s scientific legacy, see\nBrowder (1983) and Charpentier, Ghys, Lesne (2010).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophy is primarily that of a scientist\noriginating in his own daily practice of science and in the scientific\ndebates of his time. As such, it is strongly influenced by the\nreflections of Ernst Mach, James Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.\nHowever, his thinking is also strongly influenced by the philosophical\ndoctrines of his time (those of Emile Boutroux, who was his\nbrother-in-law, but also of Jules Lachelier, William James, etc.), and\nis imbued with the neokantism that was very much in vogue.\nNevertheless, one must not assume that Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\n\u201cKantian\u201d vocabulary is exactly that of the German\nphilosopher, given that Poincar\u00e9 often radically changes the\nmeaning of Kant\u2019s terms.\n\nIn 1880, he collaborated with \u00c9mile Boutroux on the edition of\nLeibniz\u2019 Monadology, providing an article comparing the\nphysics of Descartes and Leibniz. It was not until the 1890s, however,\nthat he became a central actor in the French philosophical scene,\nnotably through his continuous involvement in the Revue de\nm\u00e9taphysique et de morale (in which he published some\ntwenty articles) and his participation in the organization of a large\nnumber of events: the celebration of the centenary of the birth of\nDescartes, the International Congress of Philosophy of 1900, and the\ninternational edition of the works of Leibniz.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is best known for his critique of logicism and for his\ngeometric conventionalism. The two traditions interpreting\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s work thus reflect, on the one hand, a\nphilosophy of mathematics that endorses his intuitionist tendency and\nhis polemics against logicism or formalism, and, on the other hand,\nhis conventionalism both in the philosophy of science and in a broad\nlinguistic sense. In reality, these intuitionistic and formal aspects\nare two sides of the same coin, given that Poincar\u00e9 always\nsupports a single position aimed at a reconstruction of the process of\nunderstanding scientific theories (see Heinzmann 2010). Neither\nformalistic nor intuitionist nor empiricist, Poincare opens a path\nlying between a realist and an anti-realist theory of mathematical\nknowledge.\n\nAfter providing a short biographical sketch, we will present\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views organized as follows:\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nJules Henri Poincar\u00e9 was born on April 29, 1854 in Nancy in the\nLorraine region of France. His father was professor of Hygiene in the\nSchool of Medicine at the University of Nancy. His cousin Raymond was\nto become the President of the Republic of France during the period\n1913\u20131920 and his younger sister Aline married the philosopher\nEmile Boutroux. Henri was a precocious student who rose immediately to\nthe top of his class, excelling in both science and letters. At age\n13, his teacher told his mother that \u201cHenri will become a\nmathematician \u2026 I would say a great mathematician\u201d\n(Bellivier 1956: 78). During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the\nGermans occupied Nancy and the Poincar\u00e9 family was obliged to\nbillet the secretary of the civil commissar of Nancy, with whom Henri\nwould have a round of conversation each night after dinner in order to\nimprove his German (see Rollet 2012).\n\nIn 1871 Poincar\u00e9 passed the exams in letters with the grade\n\u201cgood\u201d and that in science with the grade\n\u201cfair.\u201d He received a zero in mathematics for answering a\ndifferent question from the one that was asked, apparently having\nmisunderstood the question. He then took the preparatory classes in\nmathematics and was first in his class, also first in the academic\ncompetition and first in the national competition (concours\ng\u00e9n\u00e9ral) in elementary mathematics. In Paris, he entered\nthe \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1873 and after graduating in 1875\n(second in his class having apparently lost points for his inability\nto draw), entered the \u00c9cole des Mines. An extensive\ncorrespondence with his mother has been preserved from this period of\nstudy in Paris (Rollet 2017). After brief service as a mine inspector,\nhe submitted a dissertation on partial differential equations and was\nthen hired to teach the course on differential and integral calculus\nat the University of Caen. In 1880 he submitted a paper solving a\nproblem in the theory of differential equations to the competition for\nthe grand prize in mathematics of the Academy of Sciences in Paris.\nFor the first time he made use of non-Euclidean geometry, which was\nseen by most of his contemporaries as purely speculative.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 married Louise Poulain d\u2019Andecy on April 20,\n1881 and soon thereafter joined the faculty of sciences at the\nUniversity of Paris. In 1886 he succeeded G. Lippmann in the chair of\nmathematical physics and probability. In 1896 he was given the chair\nof mathematical astronomy and celestial mechanics, in 1902 he was\nnamed professor of theoretical electricity at the Bureau de Poste et\nT\u00e9l\u00e9graph and in 1904 professor of general astronomy at\nthe \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Poincar\u00e9 also worked at the\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes from 1893 (Galison 2003).\n\nIn 1889 Poincar\u00e9 won a prize from the King of Sweden for a\nquestion posed by Weierstrass on the stability of the solar system,\nthat is, the three-body (or \\(n\\)-body) problem in\nclassical mechanics. Despite a mathematical error that he discovered\nat the last moment (after questions raised by the Swedish\nmathematician Lars Edvard Phragm\u00e9n) and frantically corrected,\nthe work was important for its use of topology and as a founding\ndocument in chaos theory, for Poincar\u00e9 showed that in general,\nthe stability of such systems cannot be demonstrated. It is also in\nthis context that he proved his famous recurrence theorem.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 joined the French Academy of Sciences in 1887 and\nbecame its president in 1906. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie\nFran\u00e7aise in 1908 on the basis of his three books on\nphilosophical and general problems in science. He also became a\ncorresponding member of many international scientific organizations.\nHis travel included a trip to America to give a lecture at the St.\nLouis World\u2019s Fair in 1904. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s extensive\ncorrespondence demonstrates the extent of his connection to the\nscientific community of his time (Nabonnand 1999; Walter 2007, 2016).\nHe also co-signed a report that played an important role in the\nrehabilitation of Dreyfus (Rollet 1999).\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is also famous for his 1904 conjecture concerning the\ntopology of three-dimensional spheres which remained one of the major\nunsolved problems in mathematics until the Russian mathematician\nGrigori Perelman succeeded in demonstrating it nearly one hundred\nyears later. Poincar\u00e9 lectured on contemporary mathematical\nphysics for years and was very much abreast of current developments.\nPopularizer of science, pedagogue, man of letters, he became an icon\nof the popular press (see Rollet 2017, XLVI). In all he published over\nfive hundred scientific papers and over thirty books. He died July 17,\n1912 in Paris from a blood clot to the brain which was a complication\nof surgery, survived by his wife and their four children (see Rollet\n2000, Boutroux 2012, Ginoux and Gerini 2012).\n2. The Structure of Science\n\nPoincar\u00e9 sets out a hierarchical view of the sciences in\nScience and Hypothesis (1902), although he does not\nexplicitly use this terminology. In his view the special sciences\npresuppose physics, which presupposes geometry, which in turn\npresupposes arithmetic. Poincar\u00e9 treats topics in a serial\norder\u2014first arithmetic, then geometry, then physics, etc. In the\nintroduction, Poincar\u00e9 says that \u201cSuch is the conclusion\nwe will reach, but to get there, we must first review the sequence of\nsciences, from arithmetic and geometry to mechanics and experimental\nphysics\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902, 2017, 2). The hierarchy\ninterpretation has recently come under criticism in an important pair\nof articles (Dunlop 2016 and 2017). We believe that clarifying what is\nmeant by hierarchy will resolve this debate (see Stump 2017 and\nFolina 2019 for further discussion). What is the relationship between\narithmetic, geometry and the rest of the sciences? Michael Friedman\noriginated the claim that Poincar\u00e9 presents the sciences in a\nhierarchy, and in doing so makes clear that what he means by hierarchy\nis that each lower level must first be in place in order to be able to\nproceed to the next level:\n\n\nBut the point perhaps can be made even more clearly if we consider\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation. For Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia had already shown clearly how we can empirically\ndiscover the law of universal gravitation\u2014on the presupposition,\nthat is, of the Newtonian laws of motion and Euclidean geometry.\nWithout these presuppositions, however, we certainly would not have\nbeen able to discover the law of gravitation. And the same example\nalso shows clearly how each level in the hierarchy of sciences\npresupposes all of the preceding levels: we would have no laws of\nmotion if we did not presuppose spatial geometry, no geometry if we\ndid not presuppose the theory of mathematical magnitude, and of course\nno mathematics at all if we did not presuppose arithmetic (Friedman\n1999, 76).\n\n\nNote that Friedman mentions the theory of mathematical magnitude as\nwell. There is a step between arithmetic and geometry, namely the\ntheory of mathematical magnitude, which is precisely the topic of\nChapter 2 of Science and Hypothesis. The theory of\nmathematical magnitude presupposes the possibility of indefinite\nrepetition, and therefore something like mathematical induction, which\nPoincar\u00e9 presents as central to arithmetic in Chapter 1 of\nScience and Hypothesis.\n\nThere is direct evidence that Poincar\u00e9 thought that mathematics\nmust be in place before we can do any empirical science. For example,\nin the opening of Chapter 12 of Science and Hypothesis, he\nremarks that: \u201cThe purpose of mathematical theories is not to\nreveal the true nature of things. Such a claim would be unreasonable.\nTheir only goal is to coordinate the physical laws that experiment\nreveals to us, but that we could not even state without the help of\nmathematics\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902, 2017, 143). Dunlop, by\ncontrast, seems to have something much stronger in mind with the idea\nof the hierarchy, which is perhaps why she calls the thesis the\ndependency hierarchy interpretation. She seems to take the\ninterpretation to be a thesis of reductionism, that geometry reduces\nto arithmetic, or at least, the intuitive reasoning used in arithmetic\nis all that we need in geometry.\n\n\nCommentators have suggested that the intuition that grounds the use of\ninduction in arithmetic also underlies the conception of a continuum,\nthat the consistency of geometrical axioms must be proved through\narithmetical induction, and that arithmetical induction licenses the\nsupposition that certain operations form a group (Dunlop 2016,\n274).\n\n\nDunlop is absolutely correct in saying that this is not\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s view. Rather, he says that we need arithmetic\nand further things in order to work in geometry. All that we take\nPoincar\u00e9 to be saying is that we still need to add, subtract,\nmultiply, and divide when we are doing geometry, but we will be doing\nmore than what we do in arithmetic. The reason that we need a theory\nof magnitude before we can do geometry is because we measure things.\nThe reason we need geometry in classical mechanics is because we are\ndoing things like tracking the elliptical orbits of the planets. Thus,\nwe also agree with Dunlop when she says that\n\u201cPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views of arithmetic and geometry cannot\nbe reconciled by supposing geometry to be founded on arithmetical\noperations or principles\u201d (Dunlop 2016, 306). We need\narithmetic, plus group theory, plus the conventions in order to have\nmetric geometry. There may be some authors who made reductionist\nclaims, but it is not what we take from Friedman\u2019s original\npresentation. Furthermore, the reductionist interpretation cannot be\nright when we get to the physical sciences, where there is clearly\nmore content in the higher-level sciences\u2014empirical content that\ncould not possibly be reduced to mathematics.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 discusses the sciences in a sequence, starting with\narithmetic. Mathematical induction is essential in arithmetic, because\nonly by using it can we make assertions about all numbers.\nPoincar\u00e9 considers mathematical induction to be a genuine\nsynthetic a priori. He next considers magnitude, which requires\narithmetic, but goes further. Likewise, geometry extends our knowledge\nstill further, but requires the theory of magnitude to make\nmeasurements, and arithmetic to combine numbers. Poincar\u00e9 then\nconsiders classical mechanics, which again extends our knowledge while\nrelying on the mathematics that came before it. Finally, he considers\ntheories of physics, where we have genuine empirical results, but\nbased on the mathematics, hypotheses and conventions that came before.\nThus the sciences are laid out like expanding concentric circles, with\nnew content being added to the base at each level. The lower levels\nare necessary preconditions for higher levels, but they are not\nsufficient.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 makes hypotheses central to his analysis of science,\ndistinguishing four kinds, which are actually given in two lists of\nthree each (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 24 and 166\u2013167; 2017: 1 and\n109\u2013110). Combining the two lists, these are:\n\nVerifiable hypotheses\nIndifferent (or neutral) hypotheses\nNatural hypotheses\nApparent hypotheses\n\n\nBy verifiable hypotheses, Poincar\u00e9 means general statements\nthat have been confirmed by experiment. These are the backbone of\nnatural science and can be seen non-controversially to be compatible\nwith standard accounts of, say, the Hypothetical-Deductive method.\nHowever, it is important for Poincar\u00e9 that this is not all of\nscience, as he is arguing for a view of science that is between\nempiricism and rationalism.\n\nIndifferent hypotheses are ontological in nature and are, for example,\nmechanical models of underlying mechanism. As Poincar\u00e9\nemphasizes, these can frequently be exchanged without sacrificing\nempirical accuracy. Take, for example, the propagation of heat, where\n\u201cthrough the effects of the averages and thanks to the\nmedium\u2019s symmetry, all the differences even out\u201d and we\nneed not inquire how each molecule radiates. Such hypotheses are mere\ntools useful for thought but \u201cunverifiable\u201d and\n\u201cuseless\u201d as such (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 169; 2017:\n111).\n\nNatural hypotheses are necessary conditions for science but are\nexperimentally inaccessible:\n\n\nIt is difficult not to suppose that the influence of very distant\nbodies is altogether negligible, that small motions obey a linear law,\nthat the effect is a continuous function of its cause. I would say the\nsame of the conditions imposed by symmetry. All these hypotheses form,\nso to speak, the foundation common to all the theories of mathematical\nphysics. (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 166; 2017: 109)\n\n\nFinally, apparent hypotheses are definitions or conventions rather\nthan actual claims about the world. They therefore may not be\nconsidered to be hypotheses at all, although they are, however, often\nmistaken for hypotheses. Poincar\u00e9 argues that (metric) geometry\nis the hypothesis most prone to such confusion. Although he presents\narithmetic in Science and Hypothesis without mentioning\nhypotheses explicitly, we can see a role for them in his analysis here\nas well, which we will present in the order that he follows.\n\nCentral to Poincar\u00e9\u2019s analysis of arithmetic is the\nprinciple of recurrence, or mathematical induction, which he\nconsidered to be a synthetic a priori principle that\n\u201cwould then seem so self-evident that we would not be able to\nconceive of the opposite proposition\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 74;\n2017: 42). The principle of mathematical induction is necessary to\nprove general statements about numbers and is thus a necessary tool in\nmathematics. Therefore the principle of mathematical induction is\nsimilar to a natural hypothesis or at least plays a similar role to\nthat of a natural hypothesis, i. e. a mathematical structure, which is\npresupposed and \u201cmore fundamental than any particular systems of\nnatural numbers\u201d (Folina 2020: 293). Of course, there are\nimportant differences between mathematical induction and the principle\nof induction used in the natural sciences. The principle of\nmathematical induction gives certainty, while the inductive\ngeneralizations in the natural sciences give only probability (1902:\n27; 2017: 3). The principle of mathematical induction is based on\n\u201cthe affirmation of the power of a mind that knows itself\ncapable of conceiving the indefinite repetition of a particular action\nas soon as this action is possible\u201d (1902: 41\u201342; 2017:\n15), so that there can be no uncertainty. It can be argued that\nPoincar\u00e9 is justified in including his analysis of arithmetic\nin Science and Hypothesis, that is, in his analysis of\nempirical science, given that there is a striking similarity between\nthe role played by the principle of mathematical induction and the\nprinciple of induction in natural science, which \u201cis as\ndifficult to justify [\u2026] as it is to get along without\nit\u201d (1905b: 176; 1913b: 345).\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues that (metric) geometry is neither a\npriori nor empirical, but rather conventional. It is important to\nnote, however, that these conventions are guided by experience\naccording to Poincar\u00e9, rather than being totally arbitrary, as\nsome later writers take conventions to be. This connotation of the\nword \u2018convention\u2019 has led to many misrepresentations of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views. The existence of consistent alternative\ngeometries shows that the geometry of space cannot be determined a\npriori. The fact that we experience material bodies and their\nrelations, rather than space, leads Poincar\u00e9 to argue that the\ngeometry of space cannot be determined empirically either. Thus,\nstatements about the geometry of space are apparent hypotheses or\nconventions that appear to be making descriptive claims, however they\nare actually closer to definitions, though they cannot be reduced to\nbeing merely linguistic.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 conceives of our perception of objects as a\ncombination of motor and visual impressions that are at first\nnon-spatial. In order to classify these sensations, which only appear\nbecause of the movement of our bodies, Poincar\u00e9 says we\nintroduce \u201csensible space\u201d as a category \u201cof our\nunderstanding\u201d that is not physical space and does not even have\na metric, meaning that \u201cit involves no idea of\nmeasurement\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1898). Sensible space is a\nnecessary condition for our understanding of our place in the world,\nthat is, for our understanding of the objects around us, their\nrelations and how they move, but it is not a form of our sensibility,\nsince individual sensations can exist without it (Poincar\u00e9\n1898: 3). Thus sensible space can be seen as an example of a natural\nhypothesis. We introduce a metric to this space in order to measure\ndistance by using the language of group theory, that is, the\nmathematical study of abstract algebraic structures. Groups serve as a\ntool of reasoning about representations of muscular sensations. We can\nchoose a group (or sub-group) which corresponds to the geometry of\nEuclid, Lobachevskii or Riemann to describe space. Poincar\u00e9\nproposes a criterion of choice between the three possible geometries,\npositing\n\n\nthe existence of an invariant sub-group, of which all the\ndisplacements are interchangeable and which is formed of all\ntranslations. (1898: 21)\n\n\nOnly Euclidean geometry meets this criterion, so the conventional\nchoice of Euclidean geometry is determined by the simplicity of\ninterchangeability that \u201ctranslated into analytical language\n[\u2026] means that there are fewer terms in the equations\u201d\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 43). The empirical underdetermination of the\ngroups has a purely contrastive (arbitrary) character if the groups\nare isolated from the background beliefs furnished by our mind\n(Stanford 2009). \u201cHolistic\u201d considerations (commodity,\nsimplicity) overcome the empirical equivalence between different\ngeometries and give more evidence for Euclidean geometry. In contrast\nto geometry, no choices between alternatives are given in\narithmetic.\n\nWe have thus far discussed arithmetic and geometry and examined a\npriori principles, natural hypotheses, and apparent hypotheses.\nIn discussion of natural science Poincar\u00e9 presents his views on\nverifiable hypotheses, which are characterized by mechanical laws that\nare arrived at through experiment:\n\n\nWhat then is a good experiment? It is one that informs us of something\nbesides an isolated fact, one that allows us to make predictions; that\nis, that allows us to generalize. For without generalization, we\ncannot make predictions. (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 158; 2017: 104)\n\n\nThe hypotheses that arise from experiment are verifiable hypotheses.\nThe process of generalization presupposes a belief in the unity and\nsimplicity of nature (see 1902: 161 ff.; 2017: 105 ff.), although it\nis important to remember that for Poincar\u00e9 experience is always\na complex phenomenon that is theory laden. Any good experiment in\nphysics can be generalized in an infinite number of ways, depending on\nour preconceived ideas, and every generalization results in a\nhypothesis. While he emphasizes the creative role of the scientist,\nPoincar\u00e9 does not go so far as to say that natural laws are\nsimple definitions, as Le Roy proposed (1901: 143).\n\nNot all laws are directly accessible to experiment. Generalization in\nphysical science has to take the mathematical form of a differential\nequation in order to grasp complexity and to unify science:\n\n\nIt is not sufficient for each elementary phenomenon to obey simple\nlaws, all those to be combined must obey the same law as well.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1902: 171; 2017: 113).\n\n\nThe law of inertia, for example, obtains only with respect to the\npre-existing category of differential equations. These differential\nequations are, in the final analysis, the physical laws:\n\n\nNewton has shown that a law is only a necessary relation between the\npresent state of the world and its immediately subsequent state. All\nthe laws discovered since are nothing else; they are in sum,\ndifferential equations. (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 119; 1913b: 292)\n\n\nIn geometry, Poincar\u00e9 supposes the pre-existent category of a\ngroup. In mechanics, the categorical tools are the principle of\n(empirical) induction and differential equations. So,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s position represents a hierarchy of elements\nthat, as in Kant, are presupposed as necessary conditions of the\npossibility of the science on the next level. The scheme of\ngeneralization in mechanics appears as follows: Experience provides\ncomplex phenomena, i.e., \u201ca confused mass of facts\u201d which\nwe reduce into a number of elementary phenomena by means of\nexperiment. From these elementary phenomena, we generalize (e.g., via\nthe empirical induction principle) to elementary facts and move, by\nmeans of differential equations, to laws and verifiable hypotheses\nwhose number should be kept as small as possible (Poincar\u00e9\n1902: 168\u2013171; 2017: 110\u2013113). Finally, laws can be\nelevated by decree to the status of principles, thus allowing the\nbasic principles of mechanics to become conventions; not arbitrary\nconventions however, since \u201cThey would be arbitrary [only] if we\nwere to lose sight of the experiments that led the founders of\nmechanics to adopt the laws and which, as imperfect as these\nexperiments may be, suffice to justify them\u201d (1902: 128; 2017:\n82). For Poincar\u00e9 the principles of mechanics\n(principle of inertia, law of acceleration, principle of relative\nmotion, etc.) are not hypotheses but rather conventions\n(Poincar\u00e9 1902: 151; 2017: 99), although they are of course of\nexperimental origin. These conventions do not constitute a choice\nbetween physical alternatives, but rather must be interpreted as\ndefining the basic terms of a theory. Immune to experimental\ndisconfirmation without being a priori in the classical\nsense, they are necessary preconditions to the sciences further up in\nthe hierarchy (Poincar\u00e9 1902: chap. VI and VII).\n\nIn the physical sciences proper, such as optics and electrodynamics,\nthe scene changes entirely and principles seem no longer to share the\nconventional character of the geometrical postulates.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cindifferent hypotheses\u201d are those\nthat the analyst assumes at the beginning of calculations and that are\nneither true nor false, but rather play roles as occupants in a\nstructure. Indifferent hypotheses differ from geometrical conventions\nin one very important sense. While geometry rests on a conventional\ndecree, the structures of physics (mechanics included) do not\nsystematically rest on indifferent hypotheses; rather, these\nhypotheses have only a psychological and pedagogic function as mental\nconstructs that are in a sense superfluous, since they can change\nwhile leaving the experimental results intact. The basis of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s structural realism can be seen in his idea\nthat the content is superfluous and that it is the relations expressed\nin natural laws that remain through time that are essential to\nscience.\n\nHere then is the methodological analogy and link between the principle\nof induction, conventions in the sense of apparent hypotheses and\nverifiable hypotheses. All are guided by experience without being\n(entirely) experimental, and all involve presupposed categories,\nnatural hypotheses or a given structure (Folina 2020). Verifiable\nhypotheses employ conventional elements in the generalization process\nand may presuppose the (empirical) principle of induction. Geometrical\nconventions are apparent hypotheses guided by the experience of\nmuscular sensations and involve the category of groups. Both these\nsorts of hypotheses, verifiable and apparent, employed in physics and\ngeometry, are in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s hierarchy of sciences framed\non the one hand by a priori principles and natural hypotheses\nthat are tools both for mathematicians and experimenters, and on the\nother hand, by indifferent hypotheses and physical principles. The\nindifferent hypotheses are conventional (in the ordinary sense)\nstipulations of ontological entities\u2014mechanical models that\nincrease our theoretical insight, while the physical principles are\neither verifiable hypotheses elevated by decree beyond the crucible of\nexperiment or well-founded with respect to the network of actual\nscience.\n3. Philosophy of mathematics\n3.1 Logic and foundations: intuition and predicativity\n\nConcerning logic and foundations of mathematics,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s position is governed by two theses:\n\nLogical inferences alone are epistemically inadequate to express\nthe essential structure of a genuine mathematical reasoning in view of\nits understandability (see Poincar\u00e9 1908: 159; 1913b:\n452).\nAs a consequence of the logical antinomies, one should avoid any\nimpredicative concept formation.\n\n\nHistorically, both theses are directed broadly against the founders of\nmodern logic and set theory such as Cantor, Peano, Frege, Russell,\nZermelo, and Hilbert. On closer inspection, the historical situation\nis more complicated. With respect to Georg Cantor, for example, we\nmust distinguish his work as a logical-set theoretical method useful\nin treating mathematical problems especially in the theory of\nfunctions on the one hand, and on the other hand, set theory as a tool\nfor foundations or for considerations on infinite cardinality. Through\nG\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, Poincar\u00e9 was familiar with\nCantor\u2019s work of the first type and uses it in his theory of\nFuchsian functions in 1882 (Poincar\u00e9 1882: 1167), even having\npersonal contact with Cantor (see Gray 1991: 22; Cantor 1991: 188; and\nD\u00e9caillot 2008: 281). However, Poincar\u00e9 rejected the\nlater foundational work of Cantor, saying that\n\n\nThere is no actual infinity, the Cantorians have forgotten that, and\nthey have fallen into contradiction. It is true that Cantorism\nrendered services, but that was when it was applied to a real problem\nwhose terms were clearly defined, and we could walk safely.\nLogisticians as Cantorians have forgotten. (Poincar\u00e9 1908:\n212\u2013213; 1913b: 484)\n\n\nWhile it has been stressed by all commentators that\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s concerns with the foundations of mathematics\nare very different from those of the logicians, there is no unanimity\non the focus of the dispute. Emile Boutroux and Warren Goldfarb claim\nthat Poincar\u00e9 is condemning the \u201clogical\u201d point of\nview for not providing psychological conviction (Boutroux 1914;\nGoldfarb 1985), while Detlefsen and Heinzmann argue for a difference\nat the epistemological level rather than a psychological one\n(Detlefsen 1992, 1993; Heinzmann 1995). In a famous response to\nRussell, Poincar\u00e9 refuses to consider logic or epistemology\nindependently from psychology (Poincar\u00e9 1909: 482). It would be\nfalse, however, to believe that he thus conflates logic and\npsychology. Indeed, Poincar\u00e9 does not use the term psychology\nin the modern sense, but rather in all situations where he wants to\nemphasize the dimension of understanding, in particular its historical\nelements, which he contrasts with the mere correct logical exposition\nof the result. It is therefore not surprising that, according to\nPoincar\u00e9, mathematics requires intuition, interpreted as an\nelement of understanding, not only in the context of discovery, but\nequally in the context of justification. As we have already seen, in\narithmetic pure intuition is necessary to justify the complete (or\nmathematical) induction principle. It should also be noted that the\nterm \u201cintuition\u201d is quite ambiguous, a fact that is well\nknown and explicitly discussed by Poincar\u00e9 himself. In The\nValue of Science, he distinguished three kinds of intuition: an\nappeal to sense and to imagination, generalization by induction, and\nintuition of pure number\u2014whence comes the axiom of induction in\nmathematics. The first two kinds cannot give us certainty, but, he\nsays, \u201cwho would seriously doubt the third, who would doubt\narithmetic?\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 33; 1913b: 216).\n\nFrom 1905, Poincar\u00e9 therefore opposed the logicist thesis that\nclaims to be able to prove all mathematical truths without recourse to\nintuition, once the principles of logic are admitted. Poincar\u00e9\nsuspected that the logicians were actually making an equivocal use of\nthe term logic and that they no longer sought the former kind, but\nrather a \u201cnew logic\u201d containing principles of synthetic\nproof or formations of non-logical concept. He was evidently right\ngiven that not only is the modern logic of predicates richer than the\ntraditional (syllogistic) logic, but in order to carry out the\nlogicist project, one is even led to expand logic again by certain\nset-theoretic postulates of existence.\n\nAs Detlefsen points out, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s most interesting\nargument does not concern the status of the basic laws of the logical\nsystems, but rather the \u201cplace of logical inference in\nmathematical proof\u201d (Detlefsen 1992: 349). According to\nPoincar\u00e9, today\u2019s admitted validity of a logical, i.e.,\ntopic-neutral, inference from a proposition \\(p\\) to a\nproposition \\(q\\) (in Tarski\u2019s conception: every\nmodel of \\(p\\) is a model of \\(q)\\) is not enough to\nsustain epistemic growth of mathematical knowledge, which\nrequires rather that \u201c\\(p\\) be seen\nmathematically to imply \\(q\\) (i.e., that \\(p\\)\nand \\(q\\) be seen as united by a\ncommon mathematical structure)\u201d (Detlefsen 1993: 272).\nPoincar\u00e9 insists on the non-invariance of mathematical\nreasoning with respect to its content and advances, so to speak, a\nlocal conception of reasoning (for example, the mathematical induction\nprinciple for arithmetical reasoning). According to this view, a gap\nin a proof is no longer a logical gap, but a gap in the mathematical\nunderstanding (Detlefsen 1992: 360, 366). If\n\u201cformalization\u201d and a universal calculus are, then, no\nlonger the criterion of mathematical rigor, how shall rigor be\nmaintained? Poincar\u00e9\u2019s response mentions in particular\nthe condensing of the content of the premises to the content of the\nconclusion by means of intuition. Rigor is obtained by combining Ernst\nMach\u2019s principle of the economy of thought with the concept of\nharmony, that is, thanks to \u201cthe fortunate inventions of\nlanguage\u201d that introduce an order-structure, the complexity of a\ndomain of objects is made more harmonious by the introduction of an\ninvariance (see Poincar\u00e9 1908: 23\u201330; 1913b:\n371\u2013375). Thus, in mathematical reasoning, rigor is placed in\nthe context of a \u201cmathematical architecture\u201d whose\nsimplest expression is found in mathematical induction.\n\nRegarding the antinomies discovered at the turn of the century\u2014\nsuch as Richard\u2019s or Russell\u2019s paradoxes\u2014they are,\naccording to Poincar\u00e9, the consequence of an abusive use of\nintuition with respect to abstract entities that arises from the\nadoption of conceptual realism (Platonism). In a definition of the\nform \\(\\exists y \\forall x ((x \\in y) \\leftrightarrow D[x])\\), the\nexistence of the set \\(y\\) is intuitively postulated\nwithout any restriction for the predicate \\(D[x]\\). For an\nanti-Platonist like Poincar\u00e9 was from 1906 on, intuition is not\na mode for representing an object, but rather concerns our capacity to\nfollow a rule. We see this quite clearly in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\ndiscussion of mathematical induction.\n\nWe know that Poincar\u00e9 hoped to avoid the known antinomies by\nlimiting himself to predicative definitions (see Heinzmann 1985). It\nwas Russell who introduced the terms \u201cpredicative\u201d and\n\u201cnon-predicative\u201d to highlight the difference between two\nkinds of propositional functions, those that determine and those that\ndo not determine a class. He called the first\n\u201cpredicative\u201d and the second\n\u201cnon-predicative.\u201d Poincar\u00e9 attributed the mistake\nof non-predicative definitions to a vicious circle: a definition is\n\u201cnon-predicative\u201d if the definiens contains or\nrelates to a totality of which the definiendum is a part. He\nformulated a principle to avoid circularity, which leads directly to\nRussell\u2019s famous vicious circle principle:\n\n\nI recognize further this element of truth in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nobjection to totality, that whatever in any way concerns all\nof any or some (undetermined) of the members of a\nclass must not be itself one of the members of a class. (Russell 1973\n[1906]: 198)\n\n\nRussell succeeded in developing a theory that respects his principle,\nthe ramified type theory. In Poincar\u00e9, we find nothing that is\ncomparable, for he believed that the principle guarded against the\ndefinitional mistakes that he denounced. He did not seriously take up\nthe question and only formulated successively different variants of\nthe principle when he learned from Ernst Zermelo that the proof,\nproposed by Argand and Cauchy, of the fundamental theorem of algebra\nmakes an appeal precisely to the rejected, non-predicative\ndefinitions. Hence, only when the measures taken against the logical\nantinomies affected \u201creal mathematics\u201d did he try to\nmodify the principle. The discussion between Poincar\u00e9, Russell,\nPeano, and Zermelo on the measures to take lasted for six years. The\ndifficulty consisted in the obligation to formulate a principle that\nis neither too restrictive for the important results in analysis, nor\ntoo liberal with respect to the formations of concept to be excluded\nby reason of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophical position. The\nabsence of a truly convincing solution shows that the analysis of the\nconcept of predicativity with the help of informal methods appeared to\nhave reached its limits.\n\nIn 1912, the year of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s death, Luitzen Egbertus\nJan Brouwer in his inaugural lecture at Amsterdam characterized two\nopposing orientations in mathematics: intuitionism (in large part\nFrench) and formalism (in large part German). The two orientations\nwere represented by the greatest mathematicians of the antagonistic\nFranco-German pairing: Henri Poincar\u00e9 and David Hilbert\n(Brouwer 1912: 124\u2013125). According to the historians, the\nmodernists are thos eat the beginning of the 20th century who\nsupported an algebraization of the contents up to and including the\nlanguage of signs, while the conservative tendency finds the\njustification of mathematical knowledge before language, that is, in\nthe intellect. The polemics of the period persist today, even though\nits political metaphor (conservatism/modernism) has been reversed.\nSince the death of Bourbaki, it is fashionable to emphasize the\nintuitive aspects of mathematics. Yet, it is remarkable that Brouwer\nhimself criticizes Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conflation of \u201cthe\nlanguage of mathematics [and] the true mathematical\nconstruction\u201d (Brouwer 1907: 176). Brouwer is quite right to\nemphasize that Poincar\u00e9 does not separate language and\nmathematics. Poincar\u00e9 ascribes to language\u2014but not to\nlogic\u2014an essential role in mathematical reasoning. In this\nsense, we may say that Poincar\u00e9 is, with respect to Brouwer, a\nsemi-intuitionist who is located squarely between the two fronts of\nthe dispute. For him, mathematical reasoning possesses and must\nconserve an intuitive content that defies the formal contents. In\nsummary, the similarities and differences between Poincar\u00e9 and\nBrouwer can be shown as follows:\n\nPoincar\u00e9 and Brouwer share the conviction that intuition is\na guarantee of the certainty inherent in mathematics.\nThey share the conviction that complete induction is the\n\u201cmathematical reasoning par excellence.\u201d\nIn contrast with Poincar\u00e9, Brouwer considers intuition as\nthe unique basis of mathematical construction.\nTheir positions differ with respect to the relation that binds\nintuition and language.\nThe involvement of paradoxes is attributed by Brouwer to the\napplication of logical laws to a linguistic structure that can never\nbe transformed into proper mathematics. According to Brouwer,\nformalism is useless; according to Poincar\u00e9, the Platonistic\nphilosophy that \u2028accompanies it must be corrected.\nPoincar\u00e9 rejects an actual infinity; Brouwer accepts it\nprovided that it can be confined to an intuitive construction.\n\n3.2 Geometry: conventions, intuition and aesthetics\n\nPoincar\u00e9 was strongly influenced by and attuned to the French\nphilosophical scene, which refers to the Kantian tradition to show the\nlimits of methodological positivism. Members of the so-called\nCritique de la science movement (Benrubi 1928), which\nincludes members of the \u201cBoutroux Circle\u201d (Nye 1979)\nadvocate a mixture of positivism and Neo-Kantianism. They criticize\nboth Comte\u2019s determinism and Kant\u2019s static view of the\nmind\u2019s structure. According to Poincar\u00e9, mathematics\nrequires intuition not only in the context of discovery but also in\nthe context of justification, especially in arithmetic and logic. So\nit is not surprising that Poincar\u00e9 was discussed in German\nphilosophical circles in the Kantian tradition, for example by Ernst\nCassirer (1910), Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (1914), who is a disciple of\nAlois Rhiel, and Moritz Schlick (1918). Thus, Poincar\u00e9 was\ntaken to be one of the Neo-Kantian precursors of logical positivism.\nHowever, unlike Kant, the arithmetical \u201cpure intuition\u201d\nPoincar\u00e9 introduces is intellectual in character and\nPoincar\u00e9 does not in the least solve the problem of the unity\nof spontaneity and receptivity by the introduction of a pure\nsensibility. Rather, he changes the terms of the Kantian contrast,\nemphasizing the balance between exactness, that which is common to\nmany minds and is transmissible by discourse, and subjective\nacquaintance, which is intransmissible sensation. He expresses this\ndifficult balance in a formula well known due to its popularization by\nEinstein:\n\n\nwhat they [mathematics] have gained in rigor, they have lost in\nobjectivity. It is by distancing themselves from reality that they\nacquired this perfect purity. (Poincar\u00e9 1908: 131; 1913b:\n435)\n\n\nBecause of his concern for the application of mathematics,\nPoincar\u00e9 did not confine himself to the perfect purity of\nmathematics.\n\nThe existence of relatively consistent non-Euclidean geometries leads\nhim to the view that geometric propositions cannot be determined by\na priori intuitions and that it is necessary to study\n\u201cthe structural relations between Euclidean and non-Euclidean\ngeometry\u201d (Nye 1979: 111). Poincar\u00e9 established a famous\ndictionary translating concepts and propositions of\nLobachevskii\u2019s geometry into Euclidean geometry in order to\ncreate a model to show the relative consistency of\nLobachevskii\u2019s geometry (Poincar\u00e9 1891: 771; cf. 1902:\n68; 2017: 37). Concerning pure and applied geometry,\nPoincar\u00e9 holds the modernist-sounding views that we have no\npre-axiomatic understanding of geometric primitives, that rigor\ndemands that we eliminate appeals to intuition in geometry, and that\n(metric) geometry is neither true nor false, not only because we\ncannot verify which one is true, but also because we cannot\nempirically determine the metric geometry of space \u2018in\nprinciple.\u2019 When we speak of space, all we can talk about is the\nrelations of physical bodies:\n\n\n[B]ecause of the relativity and passivity of space, they will not\ndepend on the absolute position and orientation of the system. In\nother words, the state of the bodies and their mutual distances at a\ngiven instant will depend only on the state of these same bodies and\ntheir mutual distances at the initial instant, but will in no way\ndepend on the initial absolute position and initial absolute\norientation of the system. For brevity\u2019s sake, this is what I\nmight call the law of relativity. [\u2026] [S]uch a\nstatement is independent of any interpretation of the experiments. If\nthe law is true in the Euclidean interpretation, it will also be true\nin the non-Euclidean interpretation (Poincar\u00e9 1902:\n98\u201399; 2017: 61\u201362).\n\n\nAlthough distinguishing in 1903 the n-dimensional\n\u201crepresentative space\u201d, which is a physical continuum,\nfrom the geometrical space, which is a mathematical continuum\n(Poincar\u00e9 1905b: chap. IV),  Poincar\u00e9 always held a\nrelationalist view of space that goes further than current space-time\ntheories allow (Stump 1989; Walter 2010). \n\nSince Poincar\u00e9 so profoundly modifies the traditional view of\ngeometry as the a priori science of space, authors such as\nSchlick, Carnap, and Ernest Nagel (1939, 1979) attribute to him a\nleading role in the development of the formal conception of\nmathematics. Alberto Coffa extends Nagel\u2019s analysis by claiming\nthat there was a crisis in the interpretation of primitive geometrical\nterms in the nineteenth century that led to the development of formal\naxiomatic systems (Coffa 1986). References to a central role played by\nPoincar\u00e9 can also be found in Joan Richards\u2019 survey\n(Richards 1994) and in Jeremy Gray\u2019s account of the development\nof modernism (Gray 2008). The modernist character of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s approach is also shown by the fact that he\nmust be ranked with Duhem among those forerunners of logical\nempiricism who survive Quine\u2019s criticism of the movement, not\nprimarily for his holistic thesis concerning theory-confirmation, more\nso for his conception of geometrical conventions as a kind of hybrid\nanalytic-synthetic expressions \u201cguided\u201d by experience and\nfor his ontological \u201crelationalism\u201d which in certain\naspects comes close to Quine\u2019s doctrine. Both attempt to account\nphilosophically for the incompleteness of (scientific) objects.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues that\n\n\ncontrary to the naive dogmatists\u2019 view, that which science\ncaptures are not the things themselves, but simply relationships\nbetween them. Beyond these relations, there is no knowable reality\n(1902: 25; 2017: 2).\n\n\nThus, he rejects metaphysical realism:\n\n\nNo, beyond doubt a reality completely independent of the mind which\nconceives it, sees or feels it, is an impossibility. A world as\nexterior as that, even if it existed, would for us be forever\ninaccessible (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209)\n\n\nAlthough Quine\u2019s argument (\u201cno entity without\nidentity\u201d) finds a different motivation in a logical context\nquite distant from that of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, the result is\nsimilar. For Quine, mathematical objects are \u201cknown only by\ntheir laws\u201d and any other properties that they may have are\nirrelevant (Quine 1969: 44).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometrical conventions and his ontological\nrelationalism are nothing more than two different aspects of his\nstructural approach, as can be seen by considering two parallel\ndebates at the turn of the 20th century on the nature of\ngeometry\u2014one between Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Bertrand Russell\nand the other between David Hilbert and Gottlob Frege. Poincar\u00e9\nand Hilbert argue for a new conception of geometrical systems, while\nFrege and Russell defend a traditional way of looking at these\nsystems. The debate takes up the questions: Which geometry is true?\nWhat is the nature of definitions and axioms? To deal with the\nmultiplicity of geometries, questions about their truth, and the\nmeaning of their primitive terms, Poincar\u00e9 and Hilbert propose\na radically new view of geometry. They hold that all that we can say\nabout the meaning of \u2018point\u2019, \u2018straight line\u2019,\n\u2018distance\u2019, etc. is that which we have stated in the\naxioms or principles of the system, and that geometry is not a set of\ntruths about some previously known objects. Thus Poincar\u00e9\nformulates a new view of geometric theories, that geometry does not\nexpress true or false propositions and that there are no special\nobjects which geometry studies. Rather, geometry is just a system of\nrelations that can be applied to many kinds of objects.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues against Russell\u2019s view of definition,\nclaiming that the meaning of primitive terms can be fixed by the\ngeometrical system in which we are working. Fixing the meaning of\nprimitive terms by the system is the only way to proceed,\nPoincar\u00e9 argues, because, if we were to take a primitive term\nout of the context of a system, it would lose all meaning:\n\n\nIf one wants to isolate a term and exclude its relations with other\nterms, nothing will remain. This term will not only become\nindefinable, it will become devoid of meaning.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1900: 78, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs Poincar\u00e9 explains in a section entitled \u201cForm and\nMatter\u201d of his Monist article of 1898, the idea is that in\ngeometry the properties of the primitives or of the objects to which\ngeometrical relations are applied are not important at all, as far as\ngeometry is concerned. The set of relations that hold between the\nprimitives constitute the form, not the matter, of geometric objects,\nand these relations are what are studied. The form constitutes the\nrelational aspect of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s structuralism.\n\nBy recognizing Poincar\u00e9\u2019s heritage as a structural point\nof view, Schlick insists on the conventional aspect of his\nstructuralism. He sees in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions a third\ntype of definition between the implicit definitions of the axiomatic\nmethod and the concrete or ostensive definitions of physical objects.\nThese conventions are, as Friedman observes \u201ccrucial for an\nunderstanding of how we achieve a coordination between concepts and\nempirical reality in the mathematical exact sciences\u201d (2007:\n100). As Schlick explains:\n\n\nTo define a concept implicitly is to determine it by means of its\nrelations to other concepts. But to apply such a concept to reality is\nto choose, out of the infinite wealth of relations in the world, a\ncertain group or complex and to embrace as a unit by designating it\nwith a name. By suitable choice it is always possible under certain\ncircumstances to obtain an unambiguous designation of the real by\nmeans of the concept. Conceptual definitions and coordinations that\ncome into being in this fashion we call conventions (using this term\nin the narrower sense, because in the broader sense, of course, all\ndefinitions are agreements). It was Henri Poincar\u00e9 who\nintroduced the term convention in this narrower sense into natural\nphilosophy; and one of the most important tasks of that discipline is\nto investigate the nature and meaning of the various conventions found\nin natural science (Schlick 1925, 91\u201392).\n\n\nAccording to Schlick, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions combine\nconceptual definitions and coordinations. Given the fact that both\nexpressions are completely foreign to Poincar\u00e9\u2019s style,\nhow should one understand Schlick\u2019s claim? In fact,\nSchlick\u2019s expressions designate two different aspects of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s structural approach, which pay attention to\nthe fact that Poincar\u00e9 is not an ante rem\nstructuralist (the ante rem structuralist takes the pattern\nto exist independently of any systems that exemplify it). At first\nglance he seems to be an ontological realist with respect to\nrelational universals (but not with respect to individuals\n(relata)), despite his predicativist attitude. As Elie Zahar\nemphasizes, such a position is not naturally compatible with classical\nsemantics (logic) because this latter \u201cseems unable to interpret\nrelations except through their relata\u201d: one cannot\nconfirm \\(R(a,b)\\) without determining\n\n\nthe referents of both, \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 in order then to ascertain whether\n\\(\\lt a,b\\gt\\) belongs to the referent of \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019.\n(Zahar 2001: 38)\n\n\nAn answer to this difficulty can be found by examining four steps of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s psycho-physiological reconstruction of the\ngenesis of geometry. In his early articles, Poincar\u00e9 argues\nthat geometry concerns only the relations expressed in the axioms, not\nsome inherent features of the primitives:\n\n\nWhat we call geometry is nothing but the study of formal properties of\na certain continuous group; so we may say, space is a group.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41)\n\n\nThe first step of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s construction of geometrical\nspace via groups proceeds from the observable fact that a set of\nimpressions can be modified in two distinct ways: on the one hand\nwithout our feeling muscular sensations, and on the other, by a\nvoluntary motor action accompanied by muscular sensations. So, as in\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau, the starting point here is the\ndefinition (guided by experience) of two two-place relations: an\nexternal change \\(a\\) (with \u2018\\(x a\ny\\)\u2019 for \u2018\\(x\\) changes in \\(y\\)\nwithout muscular sensation\u2019) and an internal\nchange \\(S\\) (with \u2018\\(x S y\\)\u2019\nfor \u2018\\(x\\) changes in \\(y\\)\naccompanied by muscular sensations\u2019). In the second step, he\nintroduces a classification of external changes, some of which can be\nbrought back to the starting point by an internal change (changes of\nposition), while others (changes of state) cannot. One presupposes \u201cby\nconvention\u201d or better by decision, that the internal compensation\nfor external changes is exact and not approximate. In the third step,\nPoincar\u00e9 defines the equivalence class of changes of position\nthrough an identity condition with respect to the compensation by\ninternal changes and calls it a displacement:\n\n Two internal changes have to be considered identical iff they\nhave induced the same muscular sensations. (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 79;\n1913b: 258 ff.). \n\n\\( \\dfrac{\\alpha, \\beta \\text{ external}}{S \\text{ internal}} \\Bigg\\} \\text{ changes}\\)\n\n\\(\\alpha \\sim \\beta\\) iff \\(\\exists S (S\\alpha \\doteq S\\beta \\doteq I)\\)\n\nThis means that two external changes are equivalent iff they possess a\ncommon character (i.e., to be canceled by \\(S\\)).\n\\(S = S'\\) iff \\(\\exists \\alpha(\\alpha S \\doteq \\alpha S \\doteq I)\\) \nIf \u201c\\(\\sim\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\approx\\)\u201d are equivalent\nrelations, then each equivalence class of the changes of position is a\ndisplacement, so we can recognize that two displacements are\nidentical. \n\n\nThe fourth step and Poincar\u00e9\u2019s main result is that each\nset of displacement classes (external & internal) forms a group in\nthe mathematical sense. The general concept of a group is a form of\nour understanding that \u201cpre-exists in our mind\u201d (1902:107;\n2017: 56 and 68; 1898: 42\u201343) or is an ante rem\nstructure, which the specific displacement-structure \\((=\\)\ntransformation group) exemplifies. Thus, the genesis of geometry is\nbased on an epistemological process founded on previous\nclassifications, carried out as a relationship between a structure as\nnorm of invariance and conventionally adapted systems as\ninstantiations or exemplifications of these norms.\n\nWhere there is a choice between different possibilities, conventions\nonly become involved at a further step of the mathematical\nconstruction where the properties of the transformation group are\nstudied and choices are made concerning distance (a metric). It\nfollows that the Euclidean axiom of distance is not\nexclusively the result of a conventional (decisional) choice\nin the linguistic sense, rather, it is a \u201cdisguised\ndefinition\u201d or an \u201capparent hypothesis.\u201d\nPoincar\u00e9 uses the term \u201cdisguised definition\u201d\nbefore 1899, the year of Hilbert\u2019s famous Foundations of\nGeometry, to express the fact that language apparently used\ndescriptively is not descriptive in actuality. Certain axioms appear\ndescriptive, but instead define the objectivity of a fact\n(Poincar\u00e9 1899: 274). Such a fact is found to be defined only\nup to structure, although it clearly reflects the truth of certain\nrelations between sensations whose qualities remain unknowable, as\nshown by Helmholtz and others (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 174.\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s often quoted structuralist Credo that\nin mathematics an entity \u201cexists\u201d means \u201cthat\nits defintion does not imply a contradiction\u201d (1902: 70; 2017:\n38\u201339; 1905c: 819), must be seen in a non-Hilbertian light.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric propositions (conventions), which\nare neither true nor false, are not propositional schemata that can be\nsatisfied by a model. For reasons concerning in particular the\ninvolvement of a vicious circle with respect to the principle of\ncomplete induction, Poincar\u00e9 rejects the idea of ensuring\nmathematical reliability with a Hilbert-style consistency proof\n(Poincar\u00e9 1906: 301; cf. Detlefsen 1986: 59 ff. for a critical\nassessment). Even with respect to geometry, he takes a structural\nposition without, however, disengaging meaning and knowledge\ncompletely from ostension. Nevertheless, Poincar\u00e9 begins his\nalternative reliability construction only apparently with\nsensations as ostensive contacts with the given, since he is not an\nempiricist. Instead, in a move similar to Helmholtz\u2019s conception\nof intuition as imagined sensible impressions, Poincar\u00e9\nintroduces a representation of a two-place sensation relation, based\non the imagination of single sensations. The representation\nof an object in sensible space means nothing other than the\ndeliberate and conscious representation of muscular sensations\nthought necessary to reach the object (Poincar\u00e9 1902:\n82; 2017: 48\u201349). The sensation relations are then the\nplace-holder of the categories (forms) of sensible space and of\ngroups. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions in geometry are first of\nall the tool that he uses to close (by decision) the gap between the\nexactness of a structure and the objectivity of\nsensation-relations based on an imagined ostensive contact\n(reflecting on sensations). If this interpretation is right,\nthen Poincar\u00e9\u2019s concept of structure is not the new\nHilbertian one that derives from the axiomatization of Euclidean\ngeometry, but rather constitutes a development of the traditional\nalgebraic concept of structure and concerns continuous groups on the\none hand and the type of iteration and complete induction on the other\nhand. His epistemological stance has a strong affinity with\nSchlick\u2019s General Theory of Knowledge. Given, on the\none hand, that \u201cpure quality is impenetrable\u201d and, on the\nother hand, that knowledge is public\u2014\u201cno discourse, no\nobjectivity\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 179; 1913b:\n347\u201348)\u2014how is it possible that although we cannot be sure\nthat our experience is the same, we can intersubjectively\nknow the same thing? The answer is found in the thesis that\n\u201cscience is a system of relations\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b:\n181; 1913b: 349).\n\nContrary to in re structuralists, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nstructures are not ontologically but rather epistemically dependent on\ntheir instances. The faculty capable of creating the general concept\nof a group or of indefinite iteration is the expression of a form of\nour understanding \u201cprior to all experience\u201d\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41). He defends a kind of constructive\nepistemological Platonism or anti-nominalism (Linnebo 2011), in which\nintuition is a cognitive faculty used to grasp from series of\nimagined sensations or concrete iterations the general structure. This\nis the solution that explains Folina\u2019s characterization of\nPoincar\u00e9, which at first sight seems inconsistent, as an\nante-rem structuralist and as an anti-realist with respect to\nmathematical objects (Folina 2020). The structure is not itself a\nposition in a meta-structure, but the psycho-physiological procedure\nis the way in which we know of its existence in our mind.\nPoincar\u00e9 uses it as a metamathematical \u201cinstrument which\nserves not to represents things to ourselves, but to reason\u201d\nupon the psycho-physiological genesis of real actions with\nimagined sensations (Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41). The genesis\nof geometry is based on an epistemological process founded on previous\nclassifications, carried out as a relationship between a structure as\nnorm of invariance and \u201cconventionally\u201d adapted systems as\ninstantiations and exemplifications of these norms.\n\nThe exemplification of the structure by a large variety of systems\n(imagined sensations, mathematical and physical facts, objects) having\nsome characters in common is an aesthetic operation, not a logical\none. The general group structure is given by intuition rather than by\nan explicit identity criterion and the determination of its formal\nproperties expressed by the means of sub-groups is the result of a\nmastery occasioned by concrete systems (samples). The mathematician\ncreates structural harmony as does an artist. In art, the structure\ncan be implicit, while in mathematics it is normally explicit, even if\nit is qualitative. The number of their exemplifications, i.e., of\ntheir applications, is the aesthetic element \u201cuniting\u201d\nboth, mathematical and artistic structures (Poincar\u00e9\n1905b: 104; 1913b: 280). There is for example nearly no mathematical\ntheory where the notion of group does not intervene by giving the same\nname to different \u201cthings\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1921: 137).\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric or algebraic conventions form a\nconceptual construction that is irreducible to a combination of\nclearly distinguished parts of structural elements and\naesthetic exemplifications. In this sense the result of the\npsycho-physiological genesis of geometry is as a whole a system\nunderstood as a pragmatic procedure.\n\nThe insight that geometry is the result of a genesis where the\ndescription and the construction of objects are two aspects of the\nsame procedure leads to an alternative interpretation of Quine\u2019s\nthesis of the incompleteness of mathematical objects and the ideas to\nwhich they belong. The freedom that we have to choose a geometric\ndistance function is due neither to a general skepticism nor to a\npurely verbal accommodation with respect to a set theoretic\ndevelopment of the foundations of mathematics that itself possesses\nontological commitment, but rather to an ontological peculiarity of a\nnew sort (Quine 1986: 401). Structures (groups) are not patterns whose\npositions are given entities. The genesis of the geometrical metric\nstructure is as the advent of relations linked to the concrete in an\naesthetic analysis of the general idea, rather than either\nthe creation of the concrete material from the general idea (a group)\nor as the creation of the category (a group) from the concrete. What\nPoincar\u00e9 calls \u201cobjective reality common to many thinking\nbeings\u201d is exactly the \u201charmony expressed by mathematical\nlaws\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209). To move along\nthis predefined track of a reconciliation of aesthetic sensitivity and\ncognition leads directly to Nelson Goodman (1969).\n\nAs Philippe Nabonnand has remarked, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s early\npresentation of geometrical space is as a whole in fact circular:\n\n\nin his 1898 paper, [Poincar\u00e9] put forward a (mathematical)\nexplanation of the three dimensions of space. He observed that the\nEuclidean group, selected after many conventions, can be seen as\nacting on a space of three, four or five dimensions. The choice of a\nthree-dimensional space is justified by considerations of commodity.\nUnfortunately, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s argument is viciously circular\nbecause the choice of the Euclidean group was grounded on Lie\u2019s\nclassification of transformation-groups operating on \\(\\mathrm{R}^3\\)\n(Heinzmann and Nabonnand 2008: 171).\n\n\nNevertheless, Poincar\u00e9 noted his mistake and introduced in\n1905b \u201crepresentative space\u201d \u2014 a physical continuum\nto which experience proves that it is more convenient to attribute\nthree dimensions \u2014 and which may also imply the matching\nthree-dimensionality of  \u201cgeometric space,\u201d which is\na mathematical continuum, for convenience (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 94;\n1913b: 272 \u2014 in order to justify his utilization of Lie\u2019s\nclassification. The consequence is that geometry is not independent of\nany further mathematical space, the structure of which must be\npresupposed as a primitive notion, contrary to the pragmatically\nsuggested group notion existing in our mind.\n4. Philosophy of Physics\n\nConcerning the epistemological status of mechanics, Poincar\u00e9\npositions himself, as in his discussion of geometry, as holding a\nposition between empiricism and a priorism (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 111;\n2017: 71). The principles of mechanics certainly have, according to\nPoincar\u00e9, an empirical origin, but they nonetheless surpass the\nbounds of strict empiricism since the experience that leads us to an\nexperimental result rests on the repetition of a phenomenon and\ntherefore requires physical or empirical induction (Poincar\u00e9\n1902: 26; 2017: 3). Generalizations are either a hypothesis, a law, or\na confirmable thesis obtained by the fact that each result of\nempirical physics can be generalized in different ways. Indeed, we are\nobligated to simplify the experimental data and the criterion of\nsimplicity is relative to the analytical apparatus we employ, so\nconsequently, simplicity may be only be \u201capparent.\u201d Such\nanalysis of experimental data may even force us to adjust the\nexperiment. Reflecting on the generalization process shows that it\npresupposes a belief in the unity and simplicity of nature\n(Poincar\u00e9 1902: 159\u2013165; 2017: 105\u2013108). However,\nthis is only the most general kind of presupposition that is required.\nThe hypothesis of the law of inertia, for example, cannot be obtained\nexcept with respect to the preexisting category of the differential\nequation, which thus replaces the physical induction that leads to a\nsimple experimental fact.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 distinguished empirical laws from conventional\nprinciples. How does one move from \u201csimple\u201d empirical\nlaws, understood as confirmable hypotheses, to principles as\nthe result of a conventional decision to withdraw a confirmable\nhypothesis from the judgment of experience? In mechanics he employs\nthe same methodological procedure as in geometry with regard to\nclasses of displacements and groups:\n\n\nWhen a law has received a sufficient confirmation from experiment, we\nmay adopt two attitudes: Either we may leave this law in the fray; it\nwill then remain subject to incessant revision, which without any\ndoubt will end by demonstrating that it is only approximate. Or else\nwe may elevate it into a principle by adopting conventions.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 165\u2013166; 1913b: 335)\n\n\nThus, in outline, a generalization scheme in physics is presented as\nfollows: From the phenomenon we move by physical induction to the\nexperimental result and, thanks to differential equations, to the laws\nand the general hypotheses which, by a common decision of the\nscientific community, can be elevated finally to a principle.\nCertainly this is only a general scheme and the concrete process of a\ngeneralization could include many variations. The difference between\nthe geometric axiom as a \u201cdisguised definition\u201d and the\nphysical law as a principle seems to define Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nepistemological criterion that distinguishes geometry from mechanics\nfrom the ontological point of view. In geometry, the convenient\nconventions (or definitions) are chosen as a function of objects\n(solid bodies, rays) which are not the objects of the geometry.\nFurthermore, in geometry we presuppose the category of group, so\ngeometry requires a double conventional abstraction. In mechanics, the\nconventions are useful and apply to physical objects (Poincar\u00e9\n1902: 152; 2017: 100). In this context we presuppose the categories of\nempirical or physical induction and of differential equations as\nnecessary preconditions for doing science. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\napproach therefore integrates specifically Kantian elements, the idea\nthat there are preconditions, while still completely eliminating the\ntranscendental basis of these components that we find in Kant\u2019s\nthought.\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s argument in favor of the necessary\ntransmission of the conventional character of geometry to physics is\nbased on an analogy, which shows another important relationship\nbetween geometry and physics. The methodological function of\ntransformation groups with respect to the representative space\ncorresponds to the function of geometry with respect to physics. The\nanalogy runs as follows: Just as the law of displacements may\ncorrespond only approximately to the law of groups and is consequently\nconsidered to be the result of two component changes, the first being\na displacement, and the second a qualitative alteration, so\nPoincar\u00e9 regards the physical \u201ccomplex\u201d relation\nbetween two bodies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as\nthe result of two components. The first is regarded as a\n\u201csimple\u201d geometrical principle, while the second is itself\ncomposed of two \u201cepistemological laws.\u201d The bodies \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are related to figures\n\\(A'\\); and \\(B'\\) of the geometrical space so that \n\n\\[ R(A,B) \\leftrightarrow R'(A',B') \\wedge r_A (A,A') \\wedge r_B (B,B') \\]\n\n\n\\(R'\\) being a \u201cproperly\u201d geometrical proposition, and the\n\\(r_i\\) expressing the relationships between objects of the\nrepresentative space and the geometrical space, such as the relation\nbetween solid bodies and motion invariants. Poincar\u00e9 declares\nthat by changing the relations \\(r_i\\), the geometrical proposition\n\\(R'(A', B')\\) could even serve to describe the relationship between\ntwo different physical bodies (see Poincar\u00e9 1905b:\n166\u201367; 1913b: 336). Poincar\u00e9 thereby rules out any\napplication of geometry to physics based on a structural isomorphism\nwith a presupposed reality (Mette 1986: 75\u201380).\n\nThe conventional elements in physical theories were often\nmisunderstood by Poincar\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries. So, for\nexample, his affirmation that neither of the two propositions\n\u2018The earth turns round\u2019 and \u2018The earth does not turn\nround\u2019 is \u201cmore true than the other in the kinematic\nsense,\u201d is not a rehabilitation of Ptolemy\u2019s system, but\nthe consequence of the fact that in physics, the empirical systematic\n(not epistemic) under-determination of theories is limited by unifying\nconsiderations: \u201cA physical theory is by so much the more true,\nas it puts in evidence more true relations.\u201d So, the \u2018The\nearth turns round\u2019 has a richer content expressed by the\n\u201cflattening of the earth, the rotation of Foucault\u2019s\npendulum, the gyration of cyclones, the trade-winds, and who knows\nwhat else?\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 184\u201385; 1913b: 353).\nHowever, in physics proper\u2014that is, in optics and in\nelectrodynamics\u2014the conventional elements seem to be further\nweakened:\n\n\nWe come across a different kind of hypothesis and fully perceive its\nproductivity. Undoubtedly, the theories seem at first sight fragile\nand the history of science shows us how fleeting they are. However,\nthey do not entirely die out and something remains of each of them. It\nis this something that we must try to sort out, for there and only\nthere is true reality (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 26; 2017:\n3\u201330).\n\n\nIn fact, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s model of explanation, founded on a\nminimum of well-confirmed hypotheses erected into principles and from\nwhich any meaningful propositions can be deduced, is called into\nquestion by Maxwell\u2019s approach. In view of the crisis in physics\nthat was brewing toward the end of the 19th century,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s general position will not work without posing\nproblems with respect to concrete principles. We will briefly mention\nthe most interesting case, that of the application of the principle of\nrelativity to electrodynamics, which is one of the most discussed\nsubjects by historians (e.g., Goldberg 1967; Paty 1993; Miller 1996a;\nZahar 2001; Darrigol 2004; Rouch\u00e9 2008; Walter 2011, DiSalle\n2014)\u2014not least because Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein did not\ncite each other on relativity despite the fact that Einstein read\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s Science and Hypothesis before 1905\nand Poincar\u00e9 wrote Einstein a recommendation letter sometime\nafter their only meeting at the first Solvay Congress in 1911 (Walter\n2007: chap. 59.3). What is uncontroversial is that Poincar\u00e9\ndiscovered salient points of the special theory of relativity, such as\nan operational definition of clock-synchronization to the first order\nin \\(v/c\\), and a relativistic formula of the composition of speed,\nthe determination of the structure of the Lorentz-group.\n\nSince the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for electromagnetics are not\nGalileo-covariant, the classical principle of relativity according to\nwhich measurement in one inertial reference frame can be converted to\nanother by Galilean transformation is called into question. Using in\nhis famous St. Louis lecture of 1904 the designation (physical)\n\u201cprinciple of relativity\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905a: 607),\nwhich does not apply \u201cto finite equations that are directly\nobserved, but to differential equations\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1913a:\n103; 1963: 19), Poincar\u00e9 reports that Lorentz introduces the\nconjectures (i.e., the ad hoc hypotheses) of \u201clocal\ntime\u201d and of \u201cuniform contraction in the direction of\nmotion\u201d in an attempt to save the principle in its application\nto the electromagnetic domain (see Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 132 ff.;\n1913b: 305 ff.). It was indeed Poincar\u00e9 (1906) who made\nLorentz\u2019s theory fully compatible with the relativity principle.\nWe are thus naturally inclined, remarks Poincar\u00e9, to admit the\npostulate of relativity in every domain. In postulating the principle\nas a \u201cgeneral law of Nature\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1906: 495),\nits extended form finds its origin in the Galilean principle, and its\nmotivation in its compatibility with a theory explaining why no\nexperiment is able to inform us of the earth\u2019s motion relative\nto the ether. So, the principle is an element of a work in progress\ncontaining several conjectures and there is the possibility that it\nwill lose its soundness (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 146; 1913b: 319).\n\nIn fact, there are now two principles: the old one, which was made\nimmune to revision by considering it as a conventional\nprinciple and which serves to construct geometrical space via the\ntransformation group that is the mathematical expression of the\npsychological principle of the free mobility of \u201crigid\u201d\nbodies, and the new one, where the invariance concerns differential\nequations and where the geometry could now be rooted in the Lorentz\ngroup at the price of accepting a four-dimensional spacetime with\nindefinite metric (see Gray 2012: 111; Walter 2009). So, it seems that\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s old conventional construction of space where\nhe prefers Euclidean geometry on the basis of considerations of\nsimplicity and commodity must be subsumed to a new convention on\nspace-time. Indeed, Poincar\u00e9 never abandons Galilean spacetime\nbut it is not even clear if before 1912 the principle of special\nrelativity with Lorentz covariance (instead of with Galilean\ncovariance) was confirmed well enough to be unassailable by experiment\nand to make the principle with Galilean covariance unfruitful (Walter\n2009). This situation is what Larry Sklar has called\n\u201ctransient\u201d underdetermination,\n\n\nthat is, theories which are not empirically equivalent but\nare equally (or at least reasonably) well confirmed by all the\nevidence we happen to have in hand at the moment (see Stanford 2009\nand Sklar 1975: 380)\n\n\nwhile waiting to make a decision in face of new results.\n5. The Influence of Poincar\u00e9\n\nThere is no doubt that Poincar\u00e9\u2019s work has been very\ninfluential both in the sciences and in philosophy. It was already\nwidely discussed at the time it was first presented \u2014 not only\nin France but also in Germany (e.g. Ferdinand von Lindemann (1904) and\nEmil Meunier (1919))\u2014 and his geometric conventionalism also\ngreatly influenced the logical empiricists, who were linked to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s follower Louis Rougier (Rougier 1920), one of\nthe organizers of the 1935 Paris congress on scientific philosophy.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism was widely discussed again in\nthe post-WWII literature on spacetime and relativity theory in the\nphilosophy of science. His intervention in the philosophy of\nmathematics has been a source of great inspiration to critics of\nlogicism and others. In the tradition of Kant and Mach, who excluded\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d speculations from philosophy of science,\nPoincar\u00e9 is also considered to be one of the founders of this\nfield as a discipline (Brenner 2003; Moulines 2006). Poincar\u00e9\nis considered the founder of structural realism and is thought to have\nheld a productive middle of the road position on scientific realism\n(Worrall 1989). His discussion of scientific creativity has spawned a\nliterature of its own and became a standard account of how scientific\ncreativity works. His work on the stability of the solar system\ninfluenced the development of chaos theory and the classical concept\nof causality based on the fact that similar causes produce similar\neffects. Poincar\u00e9 is one of the starting points for arguments\nshowing the compatibility of ontological determinism and\nepistemological indeterminism. His famous recurrence theorem raised\nquestions for statistical mechanics and his work on probability theory\ninfluenced the early work of Hans Reichenbach (Glymour and Eberhardt\n2012).\n\nInsofar as Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophical views focus on the\ncomprehension and explanation of the activities and practice of\nmathematicians and scientists, his approach seems more current today\nthan the approach of the logical empiricists, given that the\ncontemporary \u201cpractical turn\u201d in the philosophy of science\npays less tribute to logic and the foundations of mathematics by\nformal representation than did the canonical tradition of the 20th\ncentury philosophy of science. His approach restores the depth to some\nof the critical discussions that the Vienna Circle undertook in the\nspirit of Poincar\u00e9 from the 1930s onward (Heinzmann 2016).\nThough they are missing from standard histories in philosophy of\nscience, the Swiss philosopher Ferdinand Gonseth, the French\nphilosophers Jean Cavaill\u00e8s and Albert Lautman, the Italian\nepistemologist Federico Enriques and, finally, Jean Piaget, all have\nin common a focus on mathematical practice that rejects the logical\nempiricists\u2019 strict distinction of analytic and synthetic\npropositions.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is often invoked in the philosophy of mathematics\nbecause of his discussions of the paradoxes and his diagnosis, which\nbecame the vicious circle principle. According to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s pragmatic and anti-Platonist standpoint,\nmathematical definitions and proof-procedures should be limited to\npredicative ones. Herman Weyl (1918) was the first to propose a\npredicative continuum, while later Lorenzen (1955, 1965) and,\nespecially, Kreisel (1960) and Feferman (1964) each tried to find\npredicatively definable sets following Poincar\u00e9\u2019s rough\nsketch. Hintikka (2012) argues that logicians and mathematicians did\nnot know how to implement Poincar\u00e9\u2019s insight because they\ndid not pay enough attention to the quantifier dependence and\nindependence and proposes a solution with IF-logic.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s critical remarks about the logicist project\nand about the new logic in general have been evaluated many times and\ncontinue to be discussed in the literature and to inspire those with\nsympathy towards intuitionistic or Kantian points of view (Cassirer\n1910; Dingler 1931; Folina 1992; Goldfarb 1988; Heinzmann 1995).\nAlthough the influences on Wittgenstein\u2019s work are notoriously\ndifficult to interpret, there are clearly evident similarities to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s fundamental views (Rodych 2011).\n\nMoritz Schlick is mainly responsible for bringing an interpretation of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism to the Logical Empiricists. In\nparticular, he advocated Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism (or\nat least what he thought of as Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nconventionalism) in letters to Hans Reichenbach in regards to\nReichenbach\u2019s 1920 book The Theory of Relativity and A\nPriori Knowledge (Coffa 1991, Parrini 1998, Friedman 1999;\nOberdan 2009). Later, however, Schlick criticized generalized\nconventionalism in his reprinted and widely-read article of 1935\n\u201cAre Natural Laws Conventions?\u201d Reichenbach took up\ngeometric conventionalism in his Philosophy of Space and Time\n(1928) and Carnap generalized conventions, taking them to be the\nadoption of a formal language of science. Poincar\u00e9 was widely\ncited and discussed in the heyday of the Logical Empiricists, though\nthe meaning of his conventionalism is often distorted, for example,\nwhen Popper characterizes Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions as\nanalytic judgments (Popper 2007: chap. VIII). Einstein\u2019s\ninterpretation of Poincar\u00e9 in his important article\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d is emblematic of the fate of his\ngeometric conventionalism in the philosophical literature. Einstein\nsays there that although current physics (i.e., the General Theory of\nRelativity) is not in accord with Poincar\u00e9\u2019s views, he is\ncorrect \u201csub specie aeterni,\u201d that is in\nprinciple in an ideal physics (Einstein 1921). Thus the specific\ngeometric conventionalism that Poincar\u00e9 advocated was opposed,\nbut a generalized form of conventionalism was frequently embraced.\n\nAlthough Poincar\u00e9\u2019s ideas are not the central focus of\nthe discussion of spacetime theories that blossomed in the 1960s and\n1970s, his views are always in the background. Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum\n(1968) defended geometric conventionalism, albeit with his own unique\narguments rather than Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, and critics of\nGr\u00fcnbaum and of conventionalism generally could not help but\ndirect some of their attention to Poincar\u00e9 who was rightly seen\nas the preeminent precursor to all further work on geometric\nconventionalism. Some of this literature does directly engage with\nPoincar\u00e9, notably Torretti (1978).\n\nIn 1989 John Worrall published a paper defending structural realism as\n\u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in the debate over scientific\nrealism, drawing his inspiration from Poincar\u00e9. The view came\nto be widely discussed in the philosophy of science and spawned\nfurther elaborations and differentiations into different types, such\nas ontic and epistemic structural realism (Worrall 1989; Ladyman\n2009). Poincar\u00e9\u2019s epistemological thesis that all\nstatements depend, at least partially, on a conventional conceptual\nframework is generalized in Kasimir Ajdukiewicz\u2019s radical\nconventionalism (Ajdukiewicz 1978) and is related to the Quinean\nnotion that there are logically incompatible but empirically\nequivalent theories (Quine 1990: chap. 41). (See Poincar\u00e9\n1905b: chap. X.3, which is embedded in the discussion about nominalism\nwith his former pupil \u00c9douard Le Roy for the limits that\nPoincar\u00e9 places on these ideas, and (de Paz 2021) for more on\nthe relation of Le Roy and Poincar\u00e9.))\n\nPoincar\u00e9 also spawned a large literature on scientific\ncreativity with his brief account of his discovery while stepping onto\nan omnibus during an outing of the relation between Fuchsian (or\nautomorphic) functions and non-Euclidean geometries:\n\n\nAt the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me,\nwithout anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way\nfor it, that the transformation that I had used to define the Fuchsian\nfunctions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. (1908:\n49; 1913b: 387\u2013388)\n\n\nThe story has been very widely cited and his four-step account of how\none arrives at novel ideas has been adopted by those presenting the\ndevelopment of creative ideas in analogy with Darwinian blind\nvariation, such as Donald Campbell (1987 [1960]: 99\u2013100) and\nDean K. Simonton (1988: 27\u201333; 1995: 468\u201386; 1999:\n32\u20134); see Kronfeldner for a critical survey of the literature\n(2011: esp. 64\u201365). Poincar\u00e9\u2019s creativity has also\nbeen analyzed and compared to that of other scientists, especially\nEinstein, by Arthur Miller (1984, 1992, 1996b, 1997).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s writings influenced artists (Henderson 1983),\nespecially the cubist movement which associated their artistic\napproach to that occupied by non-Euclidean geometries in the history\nof geometry. In \u201cthe mathematician of Cubism\u201d Maurice\nPrincet closely studied the work of Poincar\u00e9 (D\u00e9cimo\n2006) and how he influenced Picasso among others, and Albert Gleizes\nand Jean Metzinger (1912), the authors of the famous treatise\n\u201cDu Cubisme\u201d that provides theory to the artistic\nmovement. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s work combines the sensations\nproduced by movement with the sense of touch (as in Science and\nHypothesis) to create the fourth dimension. Maurits Cornelis\nEscher uses a paving motif of the Poincar\u00e9 disk of the\nhyperbolic plane in order to represent an infinite structure in a\nfinite space (see Dunham 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Figure 3, p.\n3). Poincar\u00e9 also directly influenced James Joyce, who\nexperimented with non-linearity and topology in his depiction of\nevents in his literature (McMorran 2020).\n",
