Possible Implications of Batson\u2019s Research for the Empirical Reality of the Virtue of Justice\nHaving reviewed this extensive research project by Batson, one\nnatural direction some philosophers might go in next is to examine\nwhat it suggests about people\u2019s moral character. This is\nespecially true for philosophers engaged in recent discussions of\nsituationism and the empirical reality of virtue and vice (Harman\n1999, 2000; Doris 1998, 2002; Snow 2010; Miller 2014).\nGiven the focus of this essay, we will only look at the virtue of\nfairness. It seems clear that Batson\u2019s results do not inspire\nmuch confidence in this virtue being widely held. For instance,\nsomething like the following seems plausible:\n\n(1)\n A person who is\nfair will reliably distribute a good fairly as opposed to selfishly,\nespecially when he or she believes that this would be the fair thing\nto do and the good is relatively small in value.\n\nBut time and again in Batson\u2019s studies, the participants\nrigged things so that they received the better outcome. Admittedly, to\ncount against (1), we have to assume that this was an unfair\ndistribution, which may be controversial. But most are likely to grant\nthat assumption, and the participants themselves did not appear to\nbelieve that what they did was the fair thing.\nSimilarly, this seems to be true of the virtue of fairness:\n\n(2)\n A person who is fair will not reliably and sincerely claim to\nhave done the morally correct thing, when he knows that what he did\nwas unfair and selfish, and the benefit to himself was relatively\nsmall in value.\n\nTo clarify, this is not a point about being honest rather than\nlying about one\u2019s behavior. Rather, the point with this criteria\nis that a fair person would likely not be deceived or be of two minds\nabout the unfairness of his behavior in such instances. He would\nclearly recognize and acknowledge that his behavior was unfair. But\nagain the participants did not tend to live up to this fairness\nstandard. As we saw, in one study those who flipped and assigned\nthemselves the positive consequence task rated what they had done as\nhighly moral (7.30 on a 1 to 9 scale), and their rating was much\nhigher than for those who assigned themselves to this task without\nflipping (4.00) (Batson et al. 1997: 1341).\nThere are other respects in which participants failed to live up to\nthe standards of fairness, but the picture is not all bleak. In fact,\nthere are many ways in which participants did not conform to the\nstandards of the vice of unfairness either. Here is one:\n\n(3)\n An unfair person does not have moral beliefs to the effect that\nunfairness is wrong in general, as well as wrong in particular\ninstances of what are widely considered to be acts of unfairness. Or\nif he does happen to have such beliefs, he will not care much about\nthem and they will not play a significant motivational role in his\npsychology.\n\nBut we saw that Batson\u2019s participants did seem to genuinely\nbelieve that the fair thing to do was to flip the coin and make the\nappropriate assignment. True, this belief did not have a significant\nmotivational role to play in some contexts, but in others it did, such\nas when taking the perspective of the other person.\nThis suggests another respect in which most people, if they are\nlike Batson\u2019s participants, would fall short of being vicious in\nthis context:\n\n(4)\nAn unfair person\nwould not reliably let his unfair behavior be significantly diminished\nor eliminated given either increased self-awareness or when\nmomentarily adopting the perspective of another person.\n\nYet the experimental manipulations Batson introduced involving a\nmirror and the instructions to imagine yourself in the place of the\nother person, seemed to eliminate the unfair behavior altogether.\nTo note one more interesting conflict with unfairness, consider the\nmotivational picture which emerged in the last few studies that were\nreviewed concerning fairness norms. Batson\u2019s results suggested\nthat participants were motivated to do the morally right/fair thing,\nbut when the flip of the coin went against them, this dutiful\nmotivation would often be outweighed by self-interested\nmotivation. Yet on a traditional Aristotelian picture of the\nvices:\n\n(5)\n An unfair person is not reliably motivated to do the morally\nright thing, even if that motivation ends up being outweighed, but\nrather is motivated to do what is unfair.\n\nThis might be too strong a characterization of an unfair person in an ordinary sense, but again we are focusing on the viciously unfair person. Yet it turned out that the participants seemed to be experiencing motivation to do the right thing. Furthermore, if they were motivationally conflicted but gave in to self-interested motivation, they would be weak of will or incontinent on the Aristotelian picture, rather than vicious.\nSo one could argue Batson\u2019s results do not sit comfortably\neither with the widespread possession of the virtue of fairness or the vice of\nunfairness. Instead they suggest that we have beliefs and desires like\nthese:\n\n\n Beliefs about what is fair and what is not fair, and the\nimportance of being fair.\n Beliefs about the relationship between not complying with certain\nfairness norms and various personal benefits such as increased time,\nmoney, alternative activities, and so forth.\n Desires in favor of being fair when doing so will contribute\ntowards complying with the relevant fairness norms, provided the\nbenefits of doing so are not (significantly) outweighed by the\ncosts.\nDesires in favor of not being fair when the benefits of complying\nwith the relevant fairness norms are (significantly) outweighed by the\ncosts, while also desiring to as much as possible still appear to be\nfair both to others and to oneself.\n\n\nWhile certainly not an exhaustive list, these mental states do seem\nlike a mixed bag, morally speaking. Some of them are quite morally\nadmirable, such as those in the first set, and by themselves could\ngive rise to positive moral behavior. Others, of course, are not\nmorally admirable, and they can help to explain the unfair behavior we\nsee in Batson\u2019s studies (For the development of a Mixed Trait\napproach to character along these lines, see Miller 2013, 2014,\n2015).\n",
