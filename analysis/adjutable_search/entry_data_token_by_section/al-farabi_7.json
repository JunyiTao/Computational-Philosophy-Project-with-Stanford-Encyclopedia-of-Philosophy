    "main_text": "Ethics and Politics\n8. Conclusion\n\nThough we now have more decent editions of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s texts and more complete\ntranslations, in English and in French in particular, many such\neditions and translations are scattered in various books and journals.\nGathering all of al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s available texts\nis no mean accomplishment. If Oxford University Press would publish\nThe Philosophical Works of al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, as it\ndid for al-Kind\u00ee in 2012 (one volume, ed. by P. Adamson &\nP.E. Pormann), beginning with those still untranslated or not fully\ntranslated into English, as well as those whose English translation is\nhidden in rare books or unusual journals, we would be eternally\ngrateful, but we are well aware that it would require several volumes\nand much time. \n\nSome texts still need to be better edited. Some texts are not\ntranslated at all into any European language or not yet into English.\nScholars do not always seem fully aware of what is available and what\nother scholars have said. Much more work still needs to be done, but a\nclearer and more complex picture of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s works is emerging. It highlights\ntheir breadth and sophistication, even if we still have trouble\npiecing together all the parts. \n",
