    "main_text": "Disjunctivism and the Causal Theory of Perception\n6. Disjunctivism and the Causal Theory of Perception\n\n\nSome philosophers associated with the disjunctive theory of perception\nare simply concerned to argue that certain common element claims lack\nadequate justification, thereby leaving us free to resist arguments\nabout perception that depend upon such claims in their premises. For\nexample, Paul Snowdon, one of the philosophers most associated with\ndisjunctivism, appeals to the possibility of a disjunctive approach to\nperceptual experience in order to undermine an argument for a thesis\nabout our concept of perception. According to the thesis that Snowdon\naims to challenge it is a conceptual requirement that, necessarily, if\nS (a subject) sees O (an object) then O is\ncausally responsible for an experience undergone by (or had by)\nS. This thesis has been labelled the Causal Theory of\nPerception (henceforth it will be referred to as the CTP).\n\n\nH.P. Grice (1961) originally propounded the main argument for the\nCTP. (Other advocates of the theory include Pears (1976) and Strawson\n(1974)). Grice\u2019s argument takes the following general form. We\nare asked to consider cases in which a subject is having an experience\nappropriate for seeing an object of a certain kind\u2014e.g., the\nsubject is having an experience such that it seems to her as if there\nis a clock in front of her. There is in fact a clock in front of the\nsubject, however, the subject fails to see the clock, for the\nsubject\u2019s experience is a hallucination\u2014perhaps induced\nby a neuroscientist stimulating her visual cortex. It is argued that\nsuch cases are indeed conceivable, and that in such cases the best\nexplanation of the subject\u2019s failure to see the object before her\nis the absence of an appropriate causal connection between the object\nand her experience. Hence the CTP is justified.\n According to Snowdon (1980, 1990, 1998, 2011), the plausibility of\nthis argument rests on a conception of perceptual experience that is\nwedded to a common element assumption\u2014in particular, the\nassumption that the kind of experience one has when one genuinely\nperceives the world is one whose intrinsic nature is independent of\nthe kinds of objects perceived. On this conception of experience,\nexperiences are amongst the events, the intrinsic natures of which are\nindependent of anything outside the subject. According to this view,\nthe \u2018looks\u2019 sentences that are true in cases of\nhallucination and in genuine perception are made true by (or are true\nin virtue of) exactly the same kind of occurrence in both cases. Once\nthis conception of perceptual experience is in play, we might then ask\nafter the extra-mental conditions required for seeing objects in our\nenvironment. The Gricean thought experiments suggest that simply\nhaving an experience that matches your surrounding environment will\nnot, in itself, be sufficient for seeing objects in your\nenvironment. So the temptation then is to think that an appropriate\ncausal connection between your experience and those objects is\nnecessary for you to see them. The motivation for the CTP is therefore\nundermined, according to Snowdon, unless it can be shown that it is\npart of our concept of perception that the common element claim\nassumed in the argument is correct.\n\n\nFollowing Hinton\u2019s lead, Snowdon argues that from the fact\nthat \u2018looks\u2019 sentences are true in cases of hallucination and in\nveridical perception, and are not ambiguous, it does not follow that\nthey are made true by (or are true in virtue of) exactly the same kind\nof occurrence in both cases, for they may instead have disjunctive\nfulfilment conditions. According to the disjunctive theory Snowdon\nconsiders, the claim that \u2018It looks to S as of there is an\nF\u2019 should be treated as being true in virtue of two\ndistinct sorts of states of affairs: Either (there is\nsomething which looks to S to be F) or (it\nis to S as if there is something which looks to S to\nbe F). This disjunctive theory allows that the two cases\n(perception and hallucination), which are described in the same way,\nmight be of a quite different nature. In particular, it allows that the\nkind of experience a subject has when she genuinely perceives the\nworld is such that its intrinsic nature is not independent of the\nkinds of objects perceived. For Snowdon, the availability of this\ndisjunctive approach to perceptual experience undermines the argument\nfor the CTP, unless proponents of the argument can say something which\nis legitimately conceptual and which shows that this disjunctive\napproach must be wrong. (So note that according to Snowdon, an\nassertion of the disjunctive theory is not actually needed for a\nrejection of the Gricean argument for the CTP.)\n\n\nFor defence of the causalist approach against disjunctivism, see Lowe\n2008. For a defence of the claim that disjunctivism is compatible with\nthe CTP, see Child 1992, 1994 and 2011.\n",
