    "main_text": "Luther\u2019s Ethics and Social Philosophy\n6. Luther\u2019s Influence\n\nLuther\u2019s thinking exerted a considerable influence not only on\nhis own time and on his immediate contemporaries, but also on those\nwho have come after him. While his most significant impact has of\ncourse been in theology, and while it would be wrong to suggest that\nthere is anything like a Lutheran school in philosophy, nonetheless\nLuther has played an important role for a range of key philosophical\nfigures from Hobbes and Leibniz, to Heidegger. This impact is\nconsidered in more detail in a separate entry, as well as his\ninfluence on \u201cmodernity\u201d more broadly. For a fuller\ndiscussion, see the entry on \n   Luther\u2019s influence on philosophy.\n",
