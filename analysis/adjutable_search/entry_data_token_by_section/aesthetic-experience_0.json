    "main_text": "Focus of aesthetic experience\n1. Focus of aesthetic experience\n\nAny aesthetic experience has intentionality: it is an experience (as)\nof some object. Typically, that object will be a work of\nart\u2014such as a sculpture, a symphony, a painting, a performance,\nor a movie\u2014or some aspect of nature, such as a bird\u2019s\nplumage, a cliff, or a bright winter morning. An aesthetic experience\nof an object with sensible features is commonly thought to be a\nperceptual experience of those sensible features. In the case of\npoems, novels, and certain pieces of conceptual art, the experience\nmight be understood as an imagined sensory experience; in the case of\nabstract or intelligible objects like theorems, it might be neither\nsensory nor imaginative in nature.\n\nIt is common to individuate aesthetic experience\npartly\u2014but typically not only\u2014in terms of the types of\nproperties on which this experience focuses. In perceiving a\nsculpture, for instance, you might experience its shape, its color,\nits resemblance to a real person, its placement in a gallery, its\nauthorship, or its representational style. Most think that aesthetic\nexperience as such focuses on only some of these properties, and\nperhaps even excludes focus on others.\n\nThis section analyzes the broad categories of properties of objects on\nwhich aesthetic experience has been said to focus: formal properties\nlike shape or composition; the powers things have to give us pleasure;\nproperties of meriting or deserving certain subjective responses;\nexpressive properties, especially those that express emotions; and\nfundamental metaphysical properties like essences or the nature of\nhumanity. It is consistent to individuate aesthetic experience by its\nfocus on more than one of these types of properties. The views\npresented under each subsection below are not mutually exclusive,\nexcept where explicitly stated.\n\nThis discussion largely treats these types of properties without\ndiscriminating between their presence in manufactured artworks vs.\naspects of nature. It will leave aside discussion of the comparative\nfundamentality of art and nature (cf. Hegel 1820\u201329 [1920];\nCroce 1938 [2007] p. 277; Adorno 1970 [1997] pp. 61\u20132; Wollheim\n1990 \u00a742\u20133; Savile 1982 Ch.8). It will also leave aside\ndiscussions of aesthetic experience that are solely focused on\naesthetic experience of nature (cf. Bullough 1912, Hepburn 1966,\nCarlson 1979, 2005, Budd 1996, Rolston 1998) or solely focused on\naesthetic experience of abstracta like theorems or proofs (cf.\nBaumgarten 1735 [1954], Hutcheson 1726 [2004], Schellekens 2022).\n",
