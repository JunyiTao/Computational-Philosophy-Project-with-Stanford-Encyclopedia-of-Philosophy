    "main_text": "Religion, Religious Experience and A Common Faith || Aligning Naturalism and Religion\n9.2 Aligning Naturalism and Religion\n\nThe challenge A Common Faith took on seems, in retrospect,\ninsurmountable. He wished to reconstruct religion in a way which\nharmonized it with his empiricism and naturalism, while showing how\nthe power of religious experience and belief could be transformed in\nways which supported and advanced a secular conception of democracy.\nReligions vary, of course, but to a large degree they posit\ntranscendent, eternal, unobservable entities and reveal themselves in\nways which are not, shall we say, open to verification. Empirical\nexperience (regardless of its specific construal) is seen as\ninferior\u2014whether castigated as flux, illusion, uncertainty, or\nconfusion, it must be left behind. In short, Dewey had squared himself\nagainst the metaphysics, epistemology, and seemingly the morality, of\nmajor religions.\n\nIt is worth noting who were ACF\u2019s intended audience.\nDewey was not addressing believers contented with\nsupernatural religion, nor religious liberals seeking a\nvia media postulating discrete realms to scientific and\nspiritual truths. Also, he was not addressing militant\natheists, whose dogmatism Dewey\n rejected.[56]\n Rather, ACF addressed those who, despite their abandonment\nof supernaturalism, nevertheless believe themselves to be religious\n(\u201cExperience, Knowledge, and Value\u201d, LW14: 79\u201380).\nACF was meant to salvage whatever made the religious attitude\nexperientially valuable while shedding both traditional religious\nframeworks and supernaturalistic beliefs.\n",
