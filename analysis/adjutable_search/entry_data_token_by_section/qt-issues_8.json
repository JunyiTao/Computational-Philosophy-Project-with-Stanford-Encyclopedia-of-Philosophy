    "main_text": "The measurement problem || The role of decoherence\n4.4 The role of decoherence\n\nA quantum state that is a superposition of two distinct terms, such\nas \n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi} = a \\ket{\\psi_{1}} + b \\ket{\\psi_{2}} , \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\) are distinguishable\nstates, is not the same state as a mixture of \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), which would be appropriate for a situation in\nwhich the state prepared was either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), but we don\u2019t know which. The difference\nbetween a coherent superposition of two terms and a mixture has\nempirical consequences. To see this, consider the double-slit\nexperiment, in which a beam of particles (such as electrons, neutrons,\nor photons) passes through two narrow slits and then impinges on a\nscreen, where the particles are detected. Take \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) to\nbe a state in which a particle passes through the top slit, and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), a state in which it passes through the bottom\nslit. The fact that the state is a superposition of these two\nalternatives is exhibited in interference fringes at the screen,\nalternating bands of high and low rates of absorption.\n\nThis is often expressed in terms of a difference between classical and\nquantum probabilities. If the particles were classical particles, the\nprobability of detection at some point \\(p\\) of the\nscreen would simply be a weighted average of two conditional\nprobabilities: the probability of detection at \\(p\\),\ngiven that the particle passed through the top slit, and the\nprobability of detection at \\(p\\), given that the\nparticle passed through the bottom slit. The appearance of\ninterference is an index of nonclassicality.\n\nSuppose, now, that the electrons interact with something else (call it\nthe environment) on the way to the screen, that could serve\nas a \u201cwhich-way\u201d detector; that is, the state of this\nauxiliary system becomes entangled with the state of the electron in\nsuch a way that its state is correlated with \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\). Then the state of the quantum system, \\(s\\),\nand its environment, \\(e\\), is\n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi} _{se} = a \\ket{ \\psi_{1}} _{s} \\ket{ \\phi_{1}} _{e} + b \\ket{ \\psi_{2}}_{s} \\ket{ \\phi_{2}} _{e} \\]\n\n\nIf the environment states \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}} _{e}\\) are\n\\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}_{e}\\) are distinguishable states, then this\ncompletely destroys the interference fringes: the particles interact\nwith the screen as if they determinately went through one slit or the\nother, and the pattern that emerges is the result of overlaying the\ntwo single-slit patterns. That is, we can treat the particles as if\nthey followed (approximately) definite trajectories, and apply\nprobabilities in a classical manner.\n\nNow, macroscopic objects are typically in interaction with a large and\ncomplex environment\u2014they are constantly being bombarded with air\nmolecules, photons, and the like. As a result, the reduced state of\nsuch a system quickly becomes a mixture of quasi-classical states, a\nphenomenon known as decoherence.\n\nA generalization of decoherence lies at the heart of an approach to\nthe interpretation of quantum mechanics that goes by the name of\ndecoherent histories approach (see the entry on\n the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics\n for an overview).\n\nDecoherence plays important roles in the other approaches to quantum\nmechanics, though the role it plays varies with approach; see the\nentry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics\n for information on this.\n",
