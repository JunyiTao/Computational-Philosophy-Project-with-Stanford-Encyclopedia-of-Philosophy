    "main_text": "Philosophical Challenges to Theory Theory || Phenomenological Critiques of TT\n4.3 Phenomenological Critiques of TT\n\nSeveral authors, drawing on phenomenological considerations, offer a\nfundamental critique of all variants of TT, arguing that TT approaches\nsystematically mischaracterize their target explanandum in crucial\nrespects (Gallagher 2001, 2020; Ratcliffe 2007; Gallagher & Zahavi\n2008; Gallagher & Hutto 2008; see Hutto & Ratcliffe 2007 for\nan overview). Such critics maintain that the way we engage with and\nunderstand others in everyday life is misdescribed when they are\ndepicted as being essentially theoretical. These philosophers\nchallenge the idea that interpersonal engagements of the sort that are\nmeant to be captured under the FP umbrella are a matter of seeking to\ninfer the underlying causes of another\u2019s behavior by means of\nmental state attribution.\n\nPhenomenological reflection, they argue, speaks against the TT\nassumption that our situation with respect to others is fundamentally\nthat of a scientific spectator to target phenomena. That TT assumption\nis fostered by thinking that if we are to understand other minds we\nmust bridge an assumed epistemic gap that exists between us and\nothers, and that we must bridge that gap by accurately depicting the\nmental states that move others to act.\n\nIt has been argued that modeling FP on a scientific\nenterprise paints a distorting picture of its character.\nPositively characterized, our everyday ways of engaging with and\nunderstanding others are said to be a matter of responding\ndirectly to the attitudes and emotions of others, making sense of\ntheir projects and commitments, and trusting or not trusting the\naccounts they give us about why they do what they do.\nPhenomenologically motivated critics of TT argue that when we deal\nwith others in these kinds of ways we do not take up a scientific\nstance towards them.\n\nThese phenomenologically motivated critics deny that TT provides an\naccurate description of what we do when we make sense of actions in\neveryday life (Herschbach 2008; Strijbos & de Bruin 2012). For\nexample, often when we are interested in another\u2019s reasons for\nacting, we get at their reason by being told directly why they acted\nthus and so though second-personal exchanges, obviating the need to\ninfer or attribute mental states to the other (Hutto 2004, 2008). To\nunderstand FP exchanges of this kind aright is, in McGeer\u2019s\nwords, to recognize that we do not \u201cinteract with one another as\nscientist to object, as observer to observed\u201d (2007: 146).\n\nThe most radical phenomenologically motivated challenge to TT holds\nthat when we look closely at how we understand one another in everyday\nlife we do not find people making mental state attributions of\nstandard FP sort at all (Ratcliffe 2006, 2007). Defending this\nanalysis, Ratcliffe offers a deflationary appraisal of FP, regarding\nit as a kind of philosophical fiction. By his lights, FP is a\nmisleading picture of our everyday ways of understanding one\nanother\u2014a picture that lacks depth and which does not come close\nto the richness of our actual practice.\n",
