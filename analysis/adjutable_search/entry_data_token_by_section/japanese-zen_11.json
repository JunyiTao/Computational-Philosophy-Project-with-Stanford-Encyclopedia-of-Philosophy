    "main_text": "An Experiential Meaning of Not-Two\n6. An Experiential Meaning of Not-Two\n\nHow then does Zen articulate the experiential meaning of \u201cnot\ntwo\u201d? Throughout its long history, which spans from the sixth\ncentury in China to the twenty-first century in Japan, Zen has\nproduced numerous ways of linguistically capturing a response to this\nquestion, depending on what \u201ctwo\u201d things are thematized in\nthe Zen dialogue (Zen mond\u014d). As a textual study, these\ndialogues are a primary way for the non-practitioner to learn what\n\u201ctwo\u201d things are by studying a discourse that unfolds\nbetween a Zen master and his disciple. Moreover, this situation is\ncomplicated by the fact that a Zen master\u2019s response is usually\ntailored to an individual disciple\u2019s caliber. This is in keeping\nwith a general method of teaching in Buddhism, i.e., speaking\nto the caliber of a listener (taiki sepp\u014d). This\ncomplication is further compounded by the differences in the\npersonality of Zen masters. Hence, Zen\u2019s responses to the above\nquestion are as varied and numerous as there are Zen masters. In spite\nof this situation, it is reasonably possible to provide a\nglimpse into the experiential meaning of \u201cnot\ntwo\u201d by looking into a phrase that often appears in Zen\ndialogues. This phrase is \u201cno-thought and no-image\u201d\n(munen mus\u014d), whose experience points to practically\ngoing beyond \u201cnot one\u201d and \u201cnot two.\u201d \n",
