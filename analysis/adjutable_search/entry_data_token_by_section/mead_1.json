    "main_text": "Language and Mind\n2. Language and Mind\n\nDewey and Mead were not only very close friends, they shared similar\nintellectual trajectories. Both went through a period in which Hegel\nwas the most significant philosophical figure for them, and both\ndemocratized and de-essentialized Hegelian ideas about the self and\ncommunity. Nevertheless, neo-hegelian organic metaphors and notions of\nnegation and conflict, reinterpreted as the problematic situation,\nremain central to their positions. The teleological also remains\nimportant in their thought, but it is reduced in scale from the world\nhistorical and localized in terms of anticipatory experiences and goal\noriented activities.\n\nFor Mead, the development of the self is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of language. To demonstrate this connection, Mead begins\nby articulating what he learned about the gesture from Wundt. Gestures\nare to be understood in terms of the behavioral responses of animals\nto stimuli from other organisms. For example, a dog barks, and a\nsecond dog either barks back or runs away. The \u201cmeaning\u201d\nof the \u201cbarking gesture\u201d is found in the response of the\nsecond organism to the first. But dogs do not understand the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of their gestures. They simply respond, that is,\nthey use symbols without what Mead refers to as\n\u201csignificance.\u201d For a gesture to have significance, it\nmust call out in a second organism a response that is functionally\nidentical to the response that the first organism anticipates. In\nother words, for a gesture to be significant it must\n\u201cmean\u201d the same thing to both organisms, and\n\u201cmeaning\u201d involves the capacity to consciously anticipate\nhow other organisms will respond to symbols or gestures. How does this\ncapacity arise? It does so through the vocal gesture.\n\nA vocal gesture can be thought of as a word or phrase. When a vocal\ngesture is used the individual making the gesture responds\n(implicitly) in the same manner as the individual hearing it. If you\nare about to walk across a busy street during rush hour, I might shout\nout, \u201cDon\u2019t walk!\u201d As I shout, I hear my gesture the\nway in which you hear it, that is, I hear the same words, and I might\nfeel myself pulling back, stopping in my tracks because I hear these\nwords. But, of course, I don\u2019t hear them exactly as you do,\nbecause I am aware of directing them to you. According to Mead,\n\u201cGestures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse\nin the individual making them the same responses which the explicitly\narouse, or are supposed to arouse, in other individuals\u201d (MSS,\n47). He also tells us that, \u201cthe critical importance of language\nin the development of human experience lies in this fact that the\nstimulus is one that can react upon the speaking individual as it\nreacts upon the other\u201d (MSS, 69).\n\nAs noted, Mead was indebted to Hegel\u2019s work, and the notion of\nreflexivity plays a fundamental role in Mead\u2019s theory of mind.\nVocal gestures\u2014which depend on sufficiently sophisticated\nnervous systems to process them\u2014allow individuals to hear their\nown gestures in the way that others hear them. If I shout\n\u201cBoo\u201d at you, I might not only scare you, I might scare\nmyself. Or, to put this in other terms, vocal gestures allow one to\nspeak to oneself when others are not present. I make certain vocal\ngestures and anticipate how they would be responded to by others, even\nwhen they are not present. The responses of others have been\ninternalized and have become part of an accessible repertoire. (Mead\nwould agree with Ludwig Wittgenstein that there are no private\nlanguages. Language is social all the way down.) According to Mead,\nthrough the use of vocal gestures one can turn\n\u201cexperience\u201d back on itself through the loop of speaking\nand hearing at relatively the same instant. And when one is part of a\ncomplex network of language users, Mead argues that this reflexivity,\nthe \u201cturning back\u201d of experience on itself, allows mind to\ndevelop.\n\n\nMentality on our approach simply comes in when the organism is able to\npoint out meanings to others and to himself. This is the point at\nwhich mind appears, or if you like, emerges\u2026. It is absurd to\nlook at the mind simply from the standpoint of the individual human\norganism; for, although it has its focus there, it is essentially a\nsocial phenomenon; even its biological functions are primarily social.\n(MSS, 132\u2013133)\n\nIt is by means of reflexiveness\u2014the turning back of the\nexperience of the individual upon himself\u2014that the whole social\nprocess is thus brought into the experience of the individuals\ninvolved in it; it is by such means, which enable the individual to\ntake the attitude of the other toward himself, that the individual is\nable consciously to adjust himself to that process, and to modify the\nresultant of that process in any given social act in terms of his\nadjustment to it. Reflexiveness, then, is the essential condition,\nwithin the social process, for the development of mind. (MSS, 134)\n\n\nMind is developed not only through the use of vocal gestures, but\nthrough the taking of roles, which will be addressed below. Here it is\nworth noting that although we often employ our capacity for\nreflexivity to engage in reflection or deliberation, both Dewey and\nMead argue that habitual, non-deliberative, experience constitutes the\nmost common way that we engage the world. The habitual involves a host\nof background beliefs and assumptions that are not raised to the level\nof (self) conscious reflection unless problems occur that warrant\naddressing. For Dewey, this background is described as \u201cfunded\nexperience.\u201d For Mead, it is the world that this there\nand the \u201cbiologic individual.\u201d\n\nThe immediate experience which is reality, and which is the final test\nof the reality of scientific hypotheses as well as the test of the\ntruth of all our ideas and suppositions, is the experience of what I\nhave called the \u201cbiologic individual.\u201d\u2026[This] term\nlays emphasis on the living reality which may be distinguished from\nreflection\u2026. Actual experience did not take place in this form\nbut in the form of unsophisticated reality. (MSS, 352\u2013353)\n\n",
