    "main_text": "\n\n\nComputer simulation was pioneered as a scientific tool in meteorology\nand nuclear physics in the period directly following World War II, and\nsince then has become indispensable in a growing number of\ndisciplines. The list of sciences that make extensive use of computer\nsimulation has grown to include astrophysics, particle physics,\nmaterials science, engineering, fluid mechanics, climate science,\nevolutionary biology, ecology, economics, decision theory, medicine,\nsociology, epidemiology, and many others. There are even a few\ndisciplines, such as chaos theory and complexity theory, whose very\nexistence has emerged alongside the development of the computational\nmodels they study.\n\n\nAfter a slow start, philosophers of science have begun to devote\nmore attention to the role of computer simulation in\nscience. Several areas of philosophical interest in\ncomputer simulation have emerged: What is the structure of the\nepistemology of computer simulation? What is the relationship\nbetween computer simulation and experiment? Does computer\nsimulation raise issues for the philosophy of science that are not\nfully covered by recent work on models more generally? What does\ncomputer simulation teach us about emergence? About the structure\nof scientific theories? About the role (if any) of fictions in\nscientific modeling? \n",
