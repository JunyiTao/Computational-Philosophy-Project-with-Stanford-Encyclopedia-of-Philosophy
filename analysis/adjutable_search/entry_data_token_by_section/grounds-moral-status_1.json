What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)?\n\nIn this section, we will discuss what having FMS amounts to \u2013 a\nnotion key to many non-utilitarian accounts of moral status. With\nrespect to this highest degree of moral status, the literature is the\nmost developed and detailed. Those with FMS are often called\n\u201cmoral persons.\u201d Standardly, FMS is understood to involve\n(i) a very stringent moral presumption against interfering with the\nbeing in various ways \u2013 destroying the being, experimenting upon\nit, directly causing its suffering, etc. While the strong presumption\nagainst interfering is the main aspect of FMS, some philosophers\ninclude as part of FMS (ii) a strong, but not necessarily stringent,\nreason to aid and (iii) a strong reason to treat fairly. Since there\nis no higher moral status, all beings with FMS are owed the same\nprotections and entitlements. That is, all beings with FMS have equal\nmoral status (see the entry on\n egalitarianism).\n\nNote that while the label \u201cFMS\u201d comes from views that\nallow degrees of moral status, some non-utilitarian philosophers (Kant\n[GMM], Regan 2004) see the same protections as comprising the one and\nonly possible moral status.\n",
