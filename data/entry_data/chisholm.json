    "preamble": "\n\nRoderick Milton Chisholm is widely regarded as one of the most\ncreative, productive, and influential American philosophers of the\n20th Century. Chisholm worked in epistemology, metaphysics,\nethics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and other areas.\nHis work constitutes a grand philosophical system somewhat in the\nmanner of Leibniz or Descartes. Chisholm continually refined \u2014\nand sometimes utterly revised \u2014 his views. He was a prolific\nwriter. The bibliography of his written work in [LLP] contains\ncitations of 320 items, including journal articles, reviews, and\nbooks. His work in epistemology alone would probably guarantee his\nposition as an outstanding figure in American philosophy. Yet he made\nmajor contributions in several areas of metaphysics and ethics as\nwell. As a result, it would be impossible to give a comprehensive\naccount of Chisholm\u2019s system in a brief article. Thus, in this\narticle we attempt to present no more than a sketch of some of\nChisholm\u2019s most distinctive and important views.

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical\n\nChisholm was born in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in 1916. As an\nundergraduate, he studied philosophy at Brown University where he\nworked with a number of distinguished philosophers including C. J.\nDucasse and R. M. Blake. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University\nin 1942. At Harvard, Chisholm worked mainly with C. I. Lewis and\nDonald C. Williams. Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore visited Harvard\nduring Chisholm\u2019s time there and each of them evidently played\nan important role in Chisholm\u2019s development as a\nphilosopher.\n\nAfter serving in the Army (primarily as a psychological tester) and\ngetting married, Chisholm was employed briefly as a lecturer at the\nBarnes Foundation in Pennsylvania. An amusing account of\nChisholm\u2019s experience at the Barnes Foundation can be found in\nChisholm\u2019s intellectual autobiography in [LLP]. He then returned\nto Brown as an assistant professor. He remained at Brown for the rest\nof his long career (aside from periods as visiting professor at\nHarvard, Graz, Princeton, Chicago, Massachusetts, Salzburg, and\nseveral other places). He was Editor of Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research from 1980 until 1986. He was then\nAssociate Editor until the time of his death.\n\nAs a result of his dealings with Russell and Moore, Chisholm became\naware of the work of Brentano and Meinong. His interest in these\nphilosophers eventually led to correspondence with Austrian\nphilosophers and visits to Graz. Several of Chisholm\u2019s\npublications, perhaps especially \u201cSentences about\nBelieving\u201d and [B&IV], helped to make some of\nBrentano\u2019s leading ideas familiar to American philosophers. In\n1972 Chisholm was awarded an honorary doctorate at Graz. He was\nintrigued to discover that it would now be correct to address him as\n\u201cProfessor Doktor Doktor h. c. Roderick M. Chisholm.\u201d\n\nChisholm was a tremendously successful teacher of philosophy. His\ncourses, both at the undergraduate level and at the graduate, were\nalways packed with enthusiastic students and colleagues. In spite of\nhis great distinction, he was modest and amusing in the classroom. He\nenjoyed engaging in animated critical discussion with students, and\nencouraged his students to present their questions and objections. In\nmany cases these questions led to revisions of the doctrines Chisholm\nhad presented. He was always pleased to receive good criticism, and\nshowed enormous creativity in producing revisions in his attempts to\novercome the problems. In his autobiography, Chisholm mentions how\ndelighted he was to have had such eager \u201crefuters\u201d in his\nclasses at Brown as well as at other places where he visited. For a\ntouching discussion of Chisholm\u2019s teaching style, see Taylor\n(1975) .\n\nChisholm directed about 59 doctoral dissertations, thus making him\nperhaps the third most prolific producer of philosophy PhDs in\nAmerican history. Many of his students went on to have distinguished\ncareers of their own. If we consider the class containing\nChisholm\u2019s students and the students of those students, it\nbecomes obvious that through his teaching, Chisholm influenced a\nremarkable number of philosophers. In addition, many of\nChisholm\u2019s colleagues and friends turned their attention to\nChisholm\u2019s work.\n\nChisholm published an extraordinary number of journal articles and\nreviews. A short discussion of some of the most important of these is\nincluded below in Section 13. He also edited, co-edited, and\ntranslated several works of others. Among the most important of the\nbooks written by Chisholm are: Perceiving: A Philosophical\nStudy [PPS], Theory of Knowledge ([TK1], [TK2], and\n[TK3] for first, second, and third editions), Person and Object: A\nMetaphysical Study [P&O], The First Person: An Essay on\nReference and Intentionality [FP], The Foundations of\nKnowing [FK], Brentano and Intrinsic Value [B&IV],\nOn Metaphysics [OM], and A Realistic Theory of\nCategories: An Essay on Ontology [RTC].\n\nChisholm received a remarkable array of academic honors and awards. He\nwas a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, President\nof the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association,\nPresident of the Metaphysical Society of America, and a member of many\nother distinguished councils and boards. He presented important\nlectures at Oxford, London, Stanford, and elsewhere. A volume of the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers is devoted to his work.\n\nAmong the books devoted to Chisholm are Analysis and\nMetaphysics (Lehrer 1975) [A&M], Roderick M.\nChisholm (Bogdan 1986) [RMCp], Essays on the Philosophy of\nRoderick M. Chisholm (Sosa 1979) [EPRMC], and The Philosophy\nof Roderick M. Chisholm (Hahn 1997) [LLP]. A special issue of the\njournal Metaphilosophy devoted entirely to Chisholm\u2019s\nwork was published in October of 2003.\n\nChisholm died in Providence, Rhode Island, in January of 1999.\nMemorial Minutes on Chisholm written by Ernest Sosa appeared in the\nProceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical\nAssociation in May of 1999. Chisholm\u2019s intellectual\nautobiography can be found in \u201cMy Philosophical\nDevelopment\u201d in [LLP]. An earlier version of his intellectual\nautobiography appears as the \u201cSelf-Profile\u201d in [RMCp].\nSome readers may be amused by Fred Feldman\u2019s Banquet Address\nfrom the Chisholm Memorial Conference held at Brown in November, 2000\nand available online (see Other Internet Resources).\n2. Philosophical Method\n\nChisholm wrote and taught in a distinctive style that inspired his\nreaders and students. His characteristic methodology was to begin his\ndiscussion of a philosophical issue by identifying a few key questions\nand citing pre-analytic data that an adequate theory should\naccommodate. In many cases his work began in the Aristotelian fashion\nwith a set of \u201caporia\u201d or puzzles. He sought to develop a\ntheory that would be adequate to the puzzles. He formulated his\ntheories by first introducing a small number of primitive or\nunanalyzed terms and then constructing an often elaborate system of\ndefinitions and principles all built on these primitives. The final\nprinciples and definitions were intended to provide the basis for\nsolutions to the puzzles with which he began. The clarity and elegance\nof the systems were remarkable, though in some cases critics worried\nthat the primitive concepts were for one reason or another suspect.\nChisholm encouraged readers and students to criticize his systems by\nproposing counterexamples and objections. They were eager to do so,\nand Chisholm took great joy in revising and improving upon his views\nin the light of their comments.\n\nChisholm was well known for his penchant for formulating definitions\nand subsequently revising them in the light of counterexamples. The\nauthors of the Philosophical Lexicon (see Other Internet\nResources) took note of this and accordingly introduced a new\ntechnical term of their own:\n\nchisholm, v. To make repeated small alterations in a\ndefinition or example. \u201cHe started with definition (d.8) and\nkept chisholming away at it until he ended up with\n(d.8\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032).\u201d\n\n3. Epistemology I \u2014 Epistemic Terms, Principles, Foundationalism\n\nChisholm is perhaps best known for his work in epistemology. Though\nthe details of formulation steadily changed, Chisholm\u2019s\nfundamental position in epistemology remained constant. Chisholm took\nit as a starting point for his epistemological theorizing that we do\nhave knowledge of the external world. In addition, Chisholm accepted\nfurther anti-skeptical doctrines concerning knowledge by memory of the\npast, and a priori knowledge of some necessary truths. He did not\nassume that he could refute skepticism. Rather, he understood\nthe central project of epistemology to be the project of showing in\ndetail how it is possible for us to have quite a lot of the knowledge\nthat, in our reflective moments, we take ourselves to have. In\nadopting this stance, he seems to have been influenced by Moore as\nwell as some of his teachers at Brown and Harvard.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive element of Chisholm\u2019s theory of\nknowledge is a set of tightly linked epistemic principles. These serve\nto display the relation between directly evident foundational\nknowledge and indirectly evident beliefs about the external world, the\npast, and other matters about which we can have knowledge. In his\ndoctoral dissertation, Chisholm made his earliest attempt to formulate\na set of such principles. [PPS] contains a more sophisticated system\nof principles. In the three editions of [TK] Chisholm presented even\nmore carefully worked out sets of proposed epistemic principles.\n\nWhen he stated these principles, Chisholm made use of several terms of\nepistemic appraisal. He appreciated the importance of explaining\nprecisely what each of these terms means. He also appreciated the\nimportance of explaining precisely how they are related. In an effort\nto explain all this, Chisholm started with a single primitive\nepistemic concept \u2014 this is the concept of greater\nreasonability, which relates the holding of one propositional\nattitude toward some proposition with the holding some other\npropositional attitude toward some proposition. In his discussion of\nthis concept, he pointed out that holding an attitude (belief, denial,\nwithholding) in one proposition could be more reasonable for a certain\nsubject than holding some attitude (belief, denial, withholding) in\nanother proposition. And then, making use of this fundamental\nepistemic concept (as well as the concepts of belief,\nrefraining and negation), Chisholm defined the concepts\nof certainty, being evident, being beyond\nreasonable doubt, being acceptable, and so on.\n\nIn [TK1] (22), Chisholm proposed these definitions of some central\nterms of epistemic appraisal:\n\n\np is reasonable for S at t\n=df believing p is more reasonable for\nS at t than withholding p.\n\np is acceptable for S at t\n=df withholding p is not more reasonable\nfor S at t than believing p.\n\np is evident for S at t\n=df (i) p is reasonable for S at\nt, and (ii) there is no proposition q such that it\nis more reasonable for S to believe q at t\nthan it is for S to believe p.\n\n\nChisholm maintained that there are logical relations among these\nconcepts. Thus, for example, he said that if something is evident,\nthen it is (at least) reasonable. A key necessary condition for\nknowing a proposition, according to Chisholm, was that the proposition\nbe evident. In some of his early works, Chisholm analyzed knowledge as\nevident true belief. In subsequent works he modified this in response\nto the Gettier problem.\n\nChapter 3 of [TK1] provides a good illustration of Chisholm\u2019s\nway of using these terms of epistemic appraisal in the statement of\nhis epistemic principles. In that chapter, he presents a set of nine\nepistemic principles. The first of these concerns\n\u201cself-presenting states\u201d. These are states such as belief,\nhope, fear and other propositional attitudes, as well as phenomenal\nstates of being appeared to in various ways, as well as states of\nintending or undertaking to do something. The principle is:\n\n(A) If there is a \u201cself-presenting state\u201d such that\nS is in that state, then it is evident to S\nthat he is in that state.\n\n\nPrinciple (A) would play a central role in a proposed explanation of\nthe possibility of a certain form of introspective knowledge. For\nexample, it would figure in an explanation of how it is possible for a\nperson to know that it now seems to him that he is seeing a doorknob.\nBy itself, (A) has no implications for knowledge of the external\nworld.\n\nSubsequent principles purport to explain further sorts of knowledge.\nPrinciple (B) says:\n\n(B) If S believes he perceives something to have a property\nF, then the proposition that he does perceive something to\nhave F, as well as the proposition that something has\nF is reasonable for S. ([TK1], 45)\n\n\n(B) applies only in cases in which S thinks he is seeing, or\nsmelling, or in some other way perceiving something to have\nF; it does not imply that in such conditions there actually\nis something that has F, or that it is evident to S\nthat there is something that has F. It implies merely that it\nis reasonable for S to believe this. Since\nreasonability is not a sufficiently strong epistemic condition for\nknowledge, this would not explain how knowledge of the external world\nis possible. But the next principle may seem to explain this.\n\n(C) If there is a sensible characteristic F such that\nS believes that he perceives something to have F,\nthen it is evident to S that he is perceiving\nsomething to have F, and that there is something that has\nF. ([TK1], 47)\n\n\nPrinciple (C) applies only in cases where F is a sensible\ncharacteristic. This would be a feature that is appropriate to one of\nthe senses, or a common sensible. But even when so restricted, (C)\nseems to be a very strong principle, for it seems to imply that some\nof our beliefs about objects in the external world are evident \u2014\nand this would be sufficient for knowledge according to the analysis\nof knowledge that Chisholm accepted at the time.\n\nHowever, on the next page Chisholm expresses some serious reservations\nabout (C). He mentions an analogy to statements of prima facie\nobligation. Such obligations can be overridden. These later remarks\nsuggest that Chisholm had intended (C) to be understood as a principle\nof merely prima facie evidence. Apparently, then, the real\nprinciple is:\n\n(C\u2032) If there is a sensible characteristic F such that\nS believes that he perceives something to have F,\nand this belief does not occur as part of some overriding wider\nsituation, then it is evident to S that he is\nperceiving something to have F, and that there is something\nthat has F.\n\n\nPrinciple (C\u2032) is considerably less bold than principle (C).\nThis can be seen if we reflect on what would count as a counterexample\nto (C). Consider a case in which a person knows perfectly well that he\nhas just taken some hallucinogenic drugs. Suppose he knows the typical\neffects of these drugs. Suppose he has good reason to believe that\nthere are no unicorns, but now he believes that he is perceiving\nsomething to be a unicorn.\n\nPrinciple (C) seems to imply that it is evident to him that there is a\nunicorn. Principle (C\u2032) does not have this implication. The fact\nthat the appearance occurs within this wider context defeats its prima\nfacie epistemic status. Although (C\u2032) is less bold than (C), it\ndoes help to explain how we can have knowledge of the sensible\ncharacteristics of external objects.\n\nThen come three principles about memory:\n\n\n(D) If S believes he remembers having perceived something to\nhave F, then the proposition that he does remember having\nperceived something to have F, as well as the proposition\nthat he did perceive that something had F, and the\nproposition that something was F, is acceptable for\nS.\n\n(E) If F is a sensible characteristic, and S\nbelieves he remembers having perceived something to have F,\nthen the proposition that he does remember having perceived something\nto have F, as well as the proposition that he did perceive\nthat something had F, and the proposition that something was\nF, is reasonable for S.\n\n(F) If there is a self presenting state P such that\nS believes he remembers having been in P, then the\nproposition that he remembers that he was in P, as well as\nthe proposition that he was in P, is one that is\nreasonable for S.\n\n\nNone of these principles would explain how we can have knowledge of\nthe past, for none of these principles implies that beliefs about the\npast can rise to the status of being evident \u2014 and\naccording to Chisholm a person can know a fact only if it is evident\nfor him.\n\nChisholm wanted to say that we can have knowledge of things beyond\nthose we \u201csee with our own eyes\u201d. These would include\nthings that are confirmed by the evidence of our senses. As a step\ntoward achieving this, he has a principle about such things. The\nprinciple makes use of the concept of the empirically\nacceptable. To find what\u2019s empirically acceptable for\nS, just consider all those propositions that get a rating of\nacceptable (or higher) by the aforementioned principles. Those are\nempirically acceptable for S at t. Chisholm does not\ndefine confirmation, but assumes we understand it.\n\n(G) If h is confirmed by the set of all things empirically\nacceptable for S at t, then h is\nacceptable for S at t. ([TK1], 53)\n\n\nBut note that this raises such things up to the level of acceptability\nonly. This is still not enough for knowledge.\n\nConsider a set of propositions that are logically consistent and\nindependent. No member is entailed by any combination of the others;\nno member is such that its negation is entailed by any combination of\nthe others. Suppose each member is confirmed by the combination of all\nthe others. Then that set is \u201cconcurrent\u201d.\n\n(H) If h is a member of a concurrent set of acceptable\npropositions for S at t, then h is\nreasonable for S at t.\n\n\nPrinciple (H) serves to raise the epistemic status of acceptable\npropositions. When they are members of concurrent sets, such\npropositions become reasonable. This is a coherentist element in\nChisholm\u2019s foundationalism in [TK1]. But it is still not quite\nsufficient for knowledge of the external world. For that, Chisholm\nfinally introduces:\n\n(I) If S believes at t that he perceives something to be\nF, and h is the proposition that there is\nsomething having the property F, and h is a member of a\nset of concurrent propositions each of which is acceptable for\nS, then h is evident to S at\nt.\n\n\nSo now we can see how, according to Chisholm at the time of [TK1],\nknowledge of the external world is possible. Let\u2019s take the\nproposition that there is a doorknob here. How can I know that?\nSuppose I am looking at, smelling, feeling, and remembering the\ndoorknob. Then via (B) lots of such propositions are reasonable for\nme. Suppose these all confirm the proposition, d, that there\nis a doorknob here. Then via (G), d is acceptable. Suppose\nall of these together with d form a concurrent set. Then via\n(H), d is reasonable. Suppose I think I am seeing the doorknob, and\nthe proposition that there is a doorknob is a member of a concurrent\nset of acceptable propositions. Then it is evident to me that there is\na doorknob here. If it\u2019s true, then I know it. If all these\nconditions are satisfied, I have knowledge of the external world.\n\nCritics may complain that this set of principles is incomplete and\nsketchy. (Indeed, in spite of the principles about memory, nothing in\nthis system even purports to explain how someone could have knowledge\nof the past.) Chisholm has given us no more than a sketch of a\npossible answer to the question of how empirical knowledge is\npossible. But it reveals the foundational, coherentist, Chisholmian\nepistemic principle-ist structure of his thought. All later variants\nretain these features. What is most distinctive about these principles\nis that they are not instances of more general logical principles and\nChisholm does not claim that they are true in virtue of any facts\nabout causal connections or reliability. They are presented as\nfundamental epistemological facts.\n4. Epistemology II \u2014 Other Epistemological Doctrines.\n\nAccording to Chisholm, epistemology consists of Socratic inquiry into\nthe questions \u201cWhat can we know?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the\ncriteria of knowledge?\u201d He thought that a puzzle faces anyone\nwho attempts to answer these questions. It appears that to answer the\nfirst question, one needs a criterion to distinguish between things\nthat are known and things that are not known. That is, one needs an\nanswer to the second question. But to have an answer to the second\nquestion, he thought, one needs a list of the things one knows so that\none can identify the features that distinguish knowledge from its\nopposite. That is, one needs an answer to the first question. Lacking\nsuch an answer, Chisholm feared, one would not be in a position to be\nconfident that any proposed criterion of knowledge was correct.\nChisholm calls those who think that they have an answer to the second\nquestion that they can use to answer the first\n\u201cmethodists\u201d and those who think that they have an answer\nto the first question that they can use to answer the second\n\u201cparticularists.\u201d Chisholm himself was a particularist,\nyet he claimed that he had no argument to offer against methodism or\nagainst the view that neither question could be answered without a\nprior answer to the other. In a number of places he said that the\nproblem of the criterion could be answered only by begging the\nquestion.\n\nA final epistemological doctrine for which Chisholm is particularly\nwell-known is internalism. Chisholm characterized internalism in the\nfollowing way: \u2018The internalist assumes that, merely by\nreflecting upon his own conscious state, he can formulate a set of\nepistemic principles that will enable him to find out, with respect to\nany possible belief he has, whether he is justified in having that\nbelief. The epistemic principles that he formulates are principles\nthat one may come upon and apply merely by sitting in one\u2019s\narmchair, so to speak, and without calling for any outside assistance.\nIn a word, one need only consider one\u2019s own state of mind\u2019\n[TK3: 76]. A crucial implication of this doctrine is that people whose\nconscious states are alike must be justified in believing the same\npropositions. Also present in the quoted passage is a related theme\nconcerning the autonomy of epistemology. Chisholm held that\nepistemologists did not need the assistance of the empirical sciences\nin answering their purely epistemological questions. In advancing\nthese doctrines, Chisholm took issue with the externalist and\nnaturalistic theories, such as the causal theory and reliabilism, that\ngained favor with many epistemologists toward the end of\nChisholm\u2019s career.\n5. Metaphysics I \u2014 The Nature of Persons\n\nThroughout his career, Chisholm thought and wrote about the\nmetaphysics of persons. His book, Person and Object, contains\nan extended discussion of the topic and the claims he makes there\nprovide a good illustration of his views about persons. Chisholm\nmaintained that a fully satisfactory metaphysics of persons would have\nto accommodate certain bits of preanalytic data, or else explain how\nthey can be false. He took these bits of data to be \u201cinnocent\nuntil proven guilty\u201d. Among these is the notion that persons are\ngenuine objects, and not merely logical fictions. Talk about persons\nmust be taken seriously, and not as a mere figure of speech. Chisholm\nmentioned further data (which he presented in the first person): (1) I\nhave various beliefs, feelings, desires, attitudes; (2) I have a body;\n(3) I am intentionally bringing about various things that I could have\nrefrained from bringing about. He went on to affirm past-tense\nversions of (1)\u2013(3): at various times in the past I had certain\nother beliefs, etc. Chisholm emphasized a kind of \u201cunity of\nconsciousness\u201d thesis according to which the contemporaneous\npsychological facts pertain to one and the same thing. Additionally,\nhe thought he was entitled (at least until strong evidence to the\ncontrary is provided) to assume that there is one thing that has\nbeliefs, and also has a body, and also engages in intentional\naction.\n\nChisholm argued that many of the alternative conceptions of persons\ndid not conform to the preanalytic data. One prominent alternative is\nthe so-called \u201cBundle Theory\u201d, which illustrates a\nstrikingly different conception of persons. On this view, there is no\nthinker of my thoughts, no \u201cowner\u201d of my body, and no doer\nof my deeds. Instead, there is just a \u201cbundle of\nperceptions\u201d. The locus classicus of this view is a\nwell-known passage in Hume\u2019s Treatise where he\nsays:\n\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can\ncatch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe\nany thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any\ntime, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of myself, and may\ntruly be said not to exist. (Treatise of Human Nature\nI.iv.vi)\n\n\nChisholm points out that this view is in sharp conflict with the\npreanalytic data since, if taken seriously, it implies that there is\nnothing that is having the perceptions, or feeling the pains and\npleasures. He goes on to claim that Hume\u2019s argument for the\nBundle Theory is based on a bit of evidence that presupposes (contrary\nto the theory) that there is an object that is doing the perceiving,\nand thinking the thoughts. Chisholm points out that Hume mentions\noccasions on which he enters into what he calls himself; Hume\nsays that on these occasions he stumbles on some particular\nperception; he says that he never notices anything other than\nthe perceptions. Who or what is this thing that is doing all this\nentering and stumbling and failing to notice? Is it some single thing?\nDoes it persist through the time of entering and stumbling and failing\nto notice? If it does, then it is the very thing whose existence Hume\nseems to be concerned to reject.\n\nCertain forms of materialism have been endorsed by many philosophers.\nAccording to some of these theories, each person is to be identified\nwith his or her body. The body is the bearer of both physical and\nmental properties. The person persists so long as his or her body\npersists. Chisholm, however, was always uneasy about such theories.\nOne of his most distinctive lines of objection involves the use of\nsome metaphysical distinctions. Consider a ship that persists through\nsuccessive replacements of parts. First one plank is replaced, then\nanother, until after some time many of the ship\u2019s original parts\nare no longer present. Chisholm describes the situation by saying that\nat each time that the ship exists, it exists in virtue of the fact\nthat a certain collection of parts exists then. The collection of\nparts that exists at a moment is an \u201cens per se\u201d\n\u2014 it exists in its own right; but the ship is an \u201cens\nper alio\u201d \u2014 it exists in virtue of the fact that some\nother things exist. Different collections of parts do duty for, or\nstand in for, the ship at different times. In some cases, a thing has\na property at a time in virtue of facts about happenings at other\ntimes. Thus, for example, a person might be a widow at a certain time,\nbut that\u2019s because of marriages and deaths that happened\nearlier. Other properties are not in this way \u201crooted\u201d in\nfacts about other times. With respect to properties that are not\nrooted outside the times they are had, Chisholm makes an interesting\nclaim about a difference between things that exist in their own right\nand things that exist in virtue of others. The ship (an ens per\nalio) has properties at times in virtue of the fact that its\nstand ins (entia per se) have those properties at those\ntimes.\n\nA famous old argument reveals something important about the identity\nof the ship through time. Suppose a ship (call it \u201cTheseus\n1\u201d) was constituted by a certain collection of parts at a\ncertain time long ago. Suppose the parts in that collection were\ngradually replaced by newer parts. Eventually we find ourselves with a\nship (\u201cTheseus 2\u201d) that is the result of all this gradual\nreplacement. It is the apparent \u201cdescendant\u201d of Theseus 1.\nSuppose, however, that the cast-off parts were all saved and\neventually were reassembled so as to constitute a ship (call it\n\u201cTheseus 3\u201d). Suppose Theseus 3 contains all and only the\nparts that constituted the original ship Theseus 1 at the outset.\nSince Theseus 3 is part-for-part indiscernible from Theseus 1, there\nis an inclination to identify Theseus 3 with Theseus 1. But since\nTheseus 2 emerged from Theseus 1 by a series of individually minor\nreplacements, there is also an inclination to identify Theseus 2 with\nTheseus 1. We cannot consistently give in to both of these\ninclinations since it is obvious that Theseus 2 is distinct from\nTheseus 3. Chisholm suggests that the facts in the world leave this\nsomewhat indeterminate. If a case like this were to arise in the real\nworld, we would leave it to the courts to make a determination of\nwhich ship is the legitimate successor to the original. If the courts\ndecide that Theseus 2 is the \u201creal\u201d descendant of Theseus\n1, then we will have to accept this conclusion for all practical\npurposes.\n\nWhen a thing \u2014 like the persisting Ship of Theseus \u2014 is a\nlogical construction out of more fundamental entities, questions of\nidentity through time become somewhat conventional. Thus Theseus 2 can\nbe identical with Theseus 1 only in a \u201cloose and popular\u201d\nsense of \u2018identical\u2019. In the \u201cstrict and\nphilosophical\u201d sense a collection of parts, C1, can be identical\nwith a collection of parts, C2, only if C1 and C2 contain exactly the\nsame parts. In this strict sense, Theseus 2 is not identical with\nTheseus 1.\n\nAt least some of what has been said about the Ship of Theseus holds\nalso for human bodies. Old parts are steadily being replaced by new\nones. After a period of time the body may contain little of the stuff\nthat originally constituted it. As a result, the body of an old person\nmay be said to be identical to the childish body with which he started\nonly in the loose and popular sense. This has implications for\nmaterialism.\n\nIf some typical form of materialism is true, then each person is his\nor her body. The implication is that an old person may be said to be\nidentical to himself as a child only in a loose and popular sense. If\nwe take this sort of materialism seriously, we will have to say that\nno person strictly persists through any change of parts. Chisholm\nfinds this incredible. He recalls an argument attributed to C. S.\nPeirce: suppose you are about to undergo surgery. Suppose you are told\nthat you can save a lot of money by taking the surgery without\nanesthesia. Instead, you will be given amnesia-inducing drugs that\nwill make you forget the pain afterwards. Still you might be uneasy,\nsince you might fear that the man undergoing the painful surgery will\nbe you. Chisholm then continues:\n\nSuppose that others come to you \u2014 friends, relatives, judges,\nclergymen \u2014 and they offer the following advice and assurance.\n\u201cHave no fear,\u201d they will say. \u201cTake the cheaper\noperation and we will take care of everything. We will lay down the\nconvention that the man on the table is not you, Jones, but is\nSmith.\u201d What ought to be obvious to you, it seems to\nme, is that the laying down of this convention should have no effect\nat all upon your decision. For you may still ask, \u201cBut\nwon\u2019t that person be I?\u201d and, it seems to me, the question\nhas an answer. ([P&O]: 111)\n\n\nChisholm\u2019s Peircean argument has considerable intuitive force.\nIt surely seems to many of us that our persistence through time is not\nsimply a matter of convention. No matter what the courts decide,\neither the person undergoing the painful surgery will be you, or he\nwon\u2019t be you. If this intuition is right, then materialism of\nthe imagined kind is false. For materialism implies that you are an\nens per alio, a logical construction. Yet each of us takes\nhimself or herself to be an ens per se.\n\nIn several places (e.g., 1991, 168), Chisholm hinted at a modal\nargument against materialism. He noted that he himself could survive\nthe loss of his hand. Thus, he has this modal property: being such\nthat it is possible for him to exist without the hand that he actually\nhas. But Chisholm contended that his body was identical with the\nparticular collection of human bodily parts that then constituted his\nbody. That collection of parts could not survive the loss of\nChisholm\u2019s hand. If Chisholm\u2019s hand were annihilated, that\ncollection would cease to exist. Thus the collection of parts does not\nhave the property of being such that it is possible for it to exist\nwithout the hand that Chisholm actually had. One application of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law implies that Chisholm is not the collection of\nparts that then constituted his body. The argument clearly presupposes\nthe doctrine of mereological essentialism, according to which if a\ncompound thing W has a certain part P, then\nW cannot exist without having P as a part.\n\nIn yet other places ([P&O], 104), Chisholm pursues another line of\nthought. Note for example that if a certain ship (an ens per\nalio) has a property such as the property of weighing so-and-so\nmany pounds at a certain time, it has this property in virtue of the\nfact that the ens per se that constitutes it at that time\nactually has that property. The \u201cstand-in\u201d really has the\nproperty; the logical construction \u201cborrows\u201d the property\nfrom the stand-in. But Chisholm considers himself at a time when he\nhas the property of hoping for rain. He asks whether he himself\nactually has that property, or whether instead he just borrows it from\nsome stand-in. He dismisses this suggestion, saying that it \u2018is\nnot to be taken seriously\u2019. If there are two things present (the\npersistent Chisholm and the temporary stand in), and each of them is\nhoping for rain, then surely it is Chisholm himself who more\nfundamentally has the property and his stand-in who has it\nderivatively. In this case, Chisholm himself must be an ens per\nse.\n\nPerhaps persons are somehow simple entities. It might appear that they\ncould be simple bodily substances \u2014 perhaps like extra-small\nversions of the Luz Bone mentioned by Leibniz (in Book II, Chapter\nxxvii of the New Essays). But Chisholm had defined\n\u2018bodily substance\u2019 as \u2018substance with parts\u2019.\nThus on his view, there cannot be a simple bodily substances. So if\nthe person is a simple substance, it must be simple and immaterial\n\u2014 a \u201cmonad\u201d as Chisholm\n says.[1]\n\nIn \u201cOn the Simplicity of the Soul\u201d (1991), Chisholm\npursues this Leibnizian line. He identifies a sort of property that he\ncharacterizes as \u201cqualitative\u201d. Any such property would\ncharacterize substances (rather than other properties, or states, or\nabstract objects); it would be a property that could characterize a\nsimple thing; it would be an internal (or, as some might prefer to\nsay, \u201cintrinsic\u201d) property of anything it characterized\n\u2013 thus a thing existing in isolation could have such a\nqualitative property. Chisholm says that the familiar mental\nproperties that we know ourselves to have (e.g., the property of\nhoping for rain) are in this way qualitative. So we know that we have\nqualitative properties. But, as he says, we never know, with respect\nto any compound thing, that it has any such qualitative property.\nThus, there is reason to doubt that we are compound things. We know\nourselves to have properties of a kind such that we do not know, of\nany compound thing, that it has properties of that kind. It\u2019s\nnot entirely clear that this argument establishes that people are not\ncompound things. Perhaps it shows only that for all we know\nwe might be simple entities.\n6. Metaphysics II \u2014 Agency and the Free Will Problem\n\nWe like to think that we are sometimes morally responsible for some of\nthe things we have done. It seems natural to suppose that if a person\nis morally responsible for something he has done, then he could have\ndone otherwise. But there is a puzzle here. Precisely what do we mean\nwhen we say of a person who acted in a certain way that \u201che\ncould have done otherwise\u201d? Chisholm takes this as a fundamental\nquestion in the metaphysics of action. It seems to be his way of\nconceiving of the so-called \u201cfree will problem\u201d. He\ndiscussed this topic in \u201cFreedom and Action\u201d (1966),\n\u201cHe Could Have Done Otherwise\u201d (1967a) and then again in\n[P&O] as well as in quite a few other papers. It would be very\ndifficult to describe in detail all the twists and turns of\nChisholm\u2019s constantly evolving views on this topic. Instead, we\nwill focus on some of the more persistent and characteristically\nChisholmian points.\n\nSuppose a certain person in fact did not go to Boston this morning,\nbut suppose it seems that he could have done so. We want to say that\nthough he stayed in Providence, he could have done otherwise \u2014\nhe could have gone to Boston. Surely the statement that he could have\ndone otherwise does not mean merely that it is logically possible that\nhe did otherwise, for superhuman and miraculous bits of behavior are\nlogically possible. But we don\u2019t want to say, of a person who\nfailed to perform a miracle, that he could have done otherwise. Nor\ndoes our statement mean that it is epistemically possible that the\nperson did otherwise. Suppose that this man was confined in\nProvidence, and utterly incapable of getting to Boston on a certain\nmorning. Suppose we know nothing about this confinement. We just know\nthat he remained in Providence. Under these circumstances, while it is\nepistemically possible for us that he went to Boston, it would not be\ncorrect to say that he could have done so. His doing otherwise than\nstaying in Providence was epistemically possible for us, but not\npossible for him in the way that bears on moral responsibility.\n\nSome have said that \u2018can\u2019s are constitutionally iffy. On a\nsimple version of this view, to say that someone could have done\notherwise is just to say that if he had chosen to do otherwise, then\nhe would have done otherwise. Chisholm points out ([P&O],\n56\u20137) two reasons why this is wrong. First, suppose the person\nwas capable of traveling in any direction and easily could have gone\nto Boston; but suppose in addition that he did not know the way to\nBoston. If he had chosen to go to Boston, he would have ended up in\nNew London. Then it is correct to say that he could have gone to\nBoston, but incorrect to say that if he had chosen to go to Boston, he\nwould have done so. Secondly, suppose the person is incapable of\nchoosing to go to Boston. Maybe he is overwhelmed with fear of Boston.\nBut if nothing else prevents the trip, it will be correct to say that\nif he had chosen to go to Boston, he would have gone, but it is\nincorrect to say that he could have gone to Boston.\n\nAnother account of \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 makes use\nof the concept of sufficient antecedent causal condition. We\nmight think that when we say that someone could have gone to Boston\ninstead of staying in Providence, what we mean is merely that at some\nearlier time this morning, his trip to Boston was causally\nindeterminate \u2014 there was no sufficient causal condition either\nfor his going to Boston or for his not going to Boston. Chisholm\nargues against this idea, too. Suppose another person was lying in\nwait in Chelmsford. Suppose this other person would have freely\ninterfered with our man\u2019s travel plans if he had tried to get to\nBoston. Then it would not be correct to say that the man could have\ngone to Boston, but it would have been correct to say that there was\nno sufficient causal condition then in place that would have prevented\nthe trip. The relevant sufficient causal condition would not have\narisen until the person lying in wait in Chelmsford had freely\ninterfered.\n\nThus we have a problem. What do we mean when we say that a person\ncould have done otherwise? Chisholm begins by introducing some\nconcepts that will serve as conceptual primitives in his account. The\nfirst of these is a concept that Chisholm calls \u201ccausal\ncontribution\u201d. If one event helps to bring about another, then\nwe have one familiar sort of causal contribution. But in other cases\nit is not an event, but a person, who causally contributes to some\nevent (1966, 284). A case (if there are any) in which a person\ncausally contributes to some event would be described as an instance\nof \u201cagent causation\u201d. Chisholm claims that in an earlier\nera philosophers would have thought that agent causation is the\nfamiliar notion; they would have assumed that event causation is to be\nexplained in terms of it. He recognized that at the time of his\nwriting the priority relation between the concepts had probably\nreversed.\n\nThe second concept that Chisholm employs is the concept of\nundertaking or endeavoring. This is an irreducibly\nteleological concept. It introduces the notion of purpose, or aim.\nChisholm makes use of this undefined expression: \u2018S\nmakes B happen in the endeavor to make A\nhappen\u2019. Suppose, for example, that a man dials a certain\ntelephone number intending thereby to make a certain phone ring in Los\nAngeles. (Recall that Chisholm started working on this material back\nin the 1960s. Telephones had dials in those days.) Let Smith be the\nman; let B be the state of affairs that consists in\nSmith\u2019s dialing the phone; let A be the state of\naffairs that consists in the phone\u2019s ringing in Los Angeles.\nThen it would be correct to say, using Chisholm\u2019s undefined\ntechnical term, that Smith made B happen in the endeavor to\nmake A happen.\n\nFrom the fact that Smith thus endeavored to make the phone ring, it\ndoes not follow that phone actually rang. Maybe it was off the hook.\nThus endeavor has a certain intentional aspect. Furthermore, assume\nthat the telephone in Los Angeles is in fact the only purple phone in\nthe Area Code. Even if Smith dialed in the endeavor to make that phone\nring, it does not follow that he dialed in the endeavor to make the\nonly purple phone in the Area Code ring. Maybe Smith didn\u2019t know\nthe color of the phone; maybe he didn\u2019t care about making purple\nphones ring. So the concept of endeavor has a further intentional\nfeature.\n\nChisholm then introduces an element of indeterminism: suppose that at\na certain time there is no sufficient causal condition for a person to\nendeavor to bring about p; suppose in addition that there is\nthen is no sufficient causal condition for him to fail to endeavor to\nbring about p. Then Chisholm wants to say that he is free to\nendeavor to make p happen.\n\nIn some such cases a person might be free to endeavor to bring about a\ncertain state of affairs, and furthermore if he were to endeavor to\nbring it about, he would succeed. Such things are directly in a\nperson\u2019s power. Chisholm notes that he is thus making the\nconcept of power \u201cconstitutionally iffy\u201d.\n\nIn other cases a person might not have a certain state of affairs\ndirectly in his power, but there might be a sequence of things,\n<p, q, r, s> such that he\nhas p directly in his power, and if he were to bring about\np, he would then have q directly in his power, and\nif \u2026 he would have s directly in his power. In such a\ncase, the person has s indirectly in his power.\n\nWith these concepts in place, Chisholm is prepared to answer the\nquestion with which he started. Suppose again that a certain person\ndid not travel to Boston this morning. To say that he could have done\notherwise \u2014 that he could have traveled to Boston this morning\n\u2014 is just to say that as of this morning, going to Boston was\neither directly or indirectly in his power. Chisholm claims \u2014\nwith some plausibility \u2014 that this account of the meaning of\n\u2018he could have done otherwise\u2019 explicates what those who\nbelieve in freedom have in mind when they say that someone could have\ndone otherwise. Furthermore, in virtue of various technicalities of\nthe definitions, it apparently turns out that Chisholm\u2019s account\nof the meaning of \u2018he could have done otherwise\u2019 is\nadequate to all the cases that prove difficult for theories such as\nthe ones surveyed above.\n\nOne essential element of Chisholm\u2019s view is the idea that there\nis a distinction between event causation and agent causation. In cases\nexclusively involving event causation, everything that causally\ncontributes to an event is another event. In cases involving agent\ncausation, among the things that causally contribute to an event is a\nperson. In virtue of this feature, Chisholm\u2019s view is generally\ncategorized as a form of libertarianism. Another essential element of\nhis view is the idea that when a person acts freely, he does something\nfor which there is no event or state or combination of events or\nstates that is a sufficient causal condition for his doing it. (There\nis also no event or state that is a sufficient causal condition for\nhis failing to do it, obviously.) In virtue of this feature of his\nview, it may be seen as incorporating an element of indeterminism.\n7. Metaphysics III \u2014 The Ontology of Events, States of Affairs, and Facts\n\nConsider the following list of kinds of things:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nTimes\nPlaces\nPropositions\nConcrete, individual events, or \u201chappenings\u201d\nFacts\nSets\n\n\nWe can imagine a metaphysician making a grand claim about this list.\nHe could say that there really are things in each of those eight\ncategories. Furthermore, he could say, there is no redundancy in the\nlist: there is nothing that belongs in more than one of the\ncategories. Finally, this metaphysician could claim that the list is\ncomplete: everything that exists falls into one or another of the\ncategories in the list. In this way our metaphysician would have\nendorsed a fairly robust ontological\n scheme.[2]\n\nThroughout quite a long period of time, Chisholm would have maintained\nthat the imagined ontological scheme violates Occam\u2019s Razor,\nsince it affirms the existence of more fundamental kinds of things\nthan we really need. More specifically, he would have thought that he\ncould accomplish considerable pruning by replacing three of these\nproposed categories with a single new category \u2014 \u201cstates\nof affairs\u201d. He thought he could explain all talk of\npropositions (category 5) by appeal to states of affairs of a certain\nsort. Similarly, he thought he could explain all talk of concrete\nevents (category 6) by appeal to states of affairs of a different\nsort. Facts (category 7) would turn out to be nothing more than true\npropositions.\n\nUnderlying Chisholm\u2019s efforts here was a methodological view\nabout ontological commitment. Suppose there is a certain statement\nthat we take to be true; suppose that statement seems to require the\nexistence of entities of a certain type. We then must admit entities\nof that type into our ontology unless we can find a way of\nparaphrasing the statement in such a way as to preserve our original\nmeaning, but to avoid any implication of the existence of the entities\nin question. As Chisholm puts it:\n\n\u2026 from the fact that a true sentence seems to commit\nus to a certain type of thing it does not follow that there is in fact\nthat type of thing. For perhaps what the sentence tells us can be\nre-expressed in such a way that it no longer even seems to commit us\nto the type of thing in question. ([P&O], 116)\n\n\nThus, Chisholm undertook to provide paraphrases for sentences about\nconcrete events, propositions, and facts. In each case, he provided a\nparaphrase that involved states of affairs (and some other items, such\nas times). But since the project turns crucially on various claims\nabout states of affairs, Chisholm took special pains to explain\nprecisely what he took a state of affairs to be.\n\nAs examples of states of affairs, Chisholm mentions such things as\nthe author of Marmion being knighted and the author of\nWaverly being knighted. Chisholm takes these to be two different\nstates of affairs; each of them existing necessarily; neither of them\ndepending for its existence on the existence of any contingent thing.\nThus, each of these states of affairs would exist even at a possible\nworld in which there is no author of Marmion or Waverly. Furthermore,\naccording to Chisholm, states of affairs may occur,\nobtain, or take place. They serve as the objects of\nsuch attitudes as belief, hope, and mere consideration. Some of them\nserve as causes and effects. In affirming the existence of states of\naffairs, Chisholm took himself to be aligned with Frege (who,\naccording to Chisholm, used the term \u2018Gedanke\u2019\nfor entities of this sort).\n\nChisholm did not want to define states of affairs as things that can\npossibly occur, since he thought that some of them could not possibly\noccur. So he proposed instead to say that p is a state of\naffairs if and only if it is possible that there is someone who\naccepts p. Even if it\u2019s impossible for p to\noccur, it is still possible for there to be someone who accepts it. As\nJaegwon Kim pointed out (Kim 1979), there is something a bit odd about\nthe fact that Chisholm attempted to define \u2018state of\naffairs\u2019 at all, since this is supposed to be a fundamental item\nin his ontology. Furthermore, as Kim also pointed out, the definition\nis of questionable value, since there is considerable disagreement\nabout the nature of the items that we \u201caccept\u201d. Some take\nthem to be sentences; others may take them to be mental items of some\n sort.[3]\n Chisholmian states of affairs are presumably intended to be neither\nlinguistic nor psychological.\n\nFor Chisholm, entailment is not a merely logical notion. If\np entails q, then not only does p logically\nimply q, it must also be the case, necessarily, that whoever\naccepts p also accepts q. Chisholm makes use of this\ndistinctive \u201cintentional\u201d concept of entailment to explain\nthe identity conditions of states of affairs. Where p and\nq are states of affairs, p is the same state of\naffairs as q if and only if p entails q and\nq entails p. This explains why Chisholm said that\nthe state of affairs of the author of Marmion being knighted\nis distinct from the state of affairs of the author of Waverly\nbeing knighted, even if the author of Waverly happens to be the\nauthor of Marmion. So, for Chisholm, states of affairs are very\nfine-grained entities.\n\nConsider the state of affairs that is expressed by the sentence\n\u2018Someone is walking\u2019. Chisholm wanted to say that this\nstate of affairs occurs whenever someone walks, and fails to occur at\ntimes when no one is walking. Other states of affairs are not like\nthis. For them, it is impossible to sometimes occur and sometimes fail\nto occur. Chisholm claims that this provides the opportunity for an\nontological reduction. We can define a proposition as a state\nof affairs of this latter sort \u2014 it is impossible for there to\nbe times when it occurs and other times when it does not occur. A\ntrue proposition is thus one that occurs; and a\nfalse proposition is one that does not occur. Chisholm thinks\nthat we may understand the principles of logic to be about these\npropositions. By saying that a fact is a true proposition,\nChisholm gains yet another ontological reduction ([P&O], 123).\n\nChisholm thought that in some cases it makes sense to speak of the\nlocation at which a state of affairs occurs. Suppose John walks in\nChicago at a certain time. Then Chisholm would be willing to say that\nthe state of affairs of John\u2019s walking occurs in\nChicago and at that time. Furthermore, some states of affairs entail\ncertain properties. The state of affairs of John\u2019s\nwalking entails the property of walking because (i) if\nthe state of affairs occurs, then something has the property of\nwalking, and furthermore, whoever accepts the state of\naffairs believes that something has the property. This gives Chisholm\nthe ammunition he needs to explain what an event is and\nthereby to effect another ontological reduction.\n\nAmong states of affairs, there are some that (i) occur, and (ii) are\nnot propositions. Furthermore, among these states of affairs, some\n(iii) entail contingent intrinsic properties that may be exemplified\nonly by individual\n things.[4]\n Chisholm says that an event is a state of affairs that\nsatisfies all of these conditions. These are intended to play the role\nin Chisholm\u2019s ontology that concrete individual events play in\nthe ontologies of philosophers who accept concrete events as\nfundamental entities.\n\nThis way of conceiving events yields certain (possibly surprising)\nresults. For one, every event occurs. For another, events happen at\ntimes and places. Furthermore, as Chisholm sees it, when an event\noccurs, there must be some individual thing or things somehow\nparticipating in the occurrence of the event. These are the things\nthat have the properties entailed by the event. The event is said to\nbe \u201cconcretized\u201d by those things. Finally, events may\nrecur. John\u2019s walking occurs when and where\nJohn walks; it occurs only if John has the property of\nwalking. It can occur on many different occasions and in many\ndifferent places. It may be an effect of some causes, and it may be a\ncause of some effects. Chisholm goes on to discuss the role of events\nin perception, causation, and explanation.\n\nHe presents an ingenious system for counting events (\u201cJohn was\ninjured while taking his third walk of the day\u201d) that makes use\nof the concepts of time, place, and concretization. Chisholm\u2019s\nefforts in this project were described by one of his philosophical\nopponents as \u201cbreathtaking\u201d (Davidson 1970, 31).\n\nWe can see, then, that around the time of [P&O], Chisholm probably\nwould have accepted an ontological scheme more like this:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nTimes\nPlaces\nStates of affairs (some of which are event-like; some of which are\nproposition-like; and some of which are fact-like)\nSets\n\n\nAs time went by, Chisholm became dissatisfied with this picture. One\nmain source of difficulty, as he saw it, was the commitment to\ntimes. Furthermore, in spite of their utterly central place\nin this ontology, he began to feel uneasy about states of affairs.\nSome of his concern evidently arose as a result of conversations with\nhis colleague Jaegwon Kim, who had developed a different theory of\nevents. On Kim\u2019s theory, if we have a suitable object\na, property F, and time t, and a\nhas F at t, then there is an event,\na\u2019s having F at t. An event is the having of a\nproperty by a thing at a time.\n\nIn his paper \u201cEvents without Times: An Essay in Ontology\u201d\n(1990), Chisholm presented a new and even more sparse ontological\nscheme. As the title indicates, times were banished. Furthermore,\nstates of affairs disappeared, replaced by the new category of\nstates. A Chisholmian state is in some ways like a Kimian\nevent. If we have a suitable contingently existing object, a,\nand we have a suitable property, F, then, if a\nactually has F, then there is the state a\u2019s\nbeing F. A state such as this is an event. If a\ndoesn\u2019t have F, then there is no such state. There are\nno non-occurring states.\n\nThere are several things to note about these events:\n\nFirst, Chisholm uses the terms \u2018substrate\u2019 and\n\u2018content\u2019 to indicate the object and property involved in\nan event. The substrate must be a contingently existing thing. The\ncontent must be a property that the substrate has contingently. Each\nevent is said to have its substrate and content essentially. So if\nthere was such an event as Plato\u2019s writing of the\nRepublic, then that event essentially involved Plato and the\nproperty of writing the Republic. The event itself could not\nhave occurred with a different substrate or content. Nor could it have\nfailed to have its \u201ccategorial\u201d property of being an\nevent.\n\nSecond, since Chisholm has banished times from his ontology, there are\nno times in a Chisholmian state. In this respect, Chisholm\u2019s\nview differs from Kim\u2019s. This might seem to leave open the\npossibility that a Chisholmian state could occur for a while, then\nstop occurring, and then start occurring again. If a state could do\nsuch a thing, then states would be relevantly like the now-banished\nstates of affairs. But Chisholm denies this possibility. He says that\nif he was reading earlier, then stopped reading, and then started\nreading again, we have two distinct states with Chisholm as\nsubstrate and reading as content. Since there are no\n\u201ctimes\u201d Chisholm is careful to avoid saying that what\ndistinguishes these two states is their time of occurrence. When we\nsay, informally, that an event recurs, all we mean is that its\nsubstrate has had its content before.\n\nThird, by the time of \u201cEvents without Times\u201d, Chisholm had\nbecome a presentist. He also was taking tense very seriously. To say\nthat there is such a thing as x is equivalent to saying that\nthere is such a thing as x now. On this view it\nwould be wrong to say that there is such a thing as Socrates; equally,\nit would be wrong to say that Socrates is such that he formerly\nexisted but no longer does. Nevertheless, Chisholm constructed\ningenious (sometimes convoluted and unintuitive) paraphrases that\nenable us to say everything we need to say about Socrates and others\nno longer among us.\n\nSo the new ontological scheme looks more like this:\n\nConcrete, individual objects, or \u201csubstances\u201d\nProperties, attributes, qualities, relations\nStates; some of which are event-like\nSets\n\n\n[OM] contains a final summing up of Chisholm\u2019s metaphysical\nsystem. In [OM] Chisholm pares away still further. Among other things,\nhe proposes to get rid of sets in favor of attributes.\n8. Metaphysics IV \u2014 Brentano\u2019s Thesis\n\nConsider the statement that John is thinking about a unicorn. This\ncould be true even if no unicorn actually exists. But surely John is\nthinking about something. His mind is not simply a blank.\nSome philosophers have wanted to say in such a case that there is an\nobject \u2014 in fact, a unicorn \u2013 about which John is\nthinking, but that this object is one that has \u201cintentional\ninexistence\u201d. It exists merely as an object of thought. In\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint, Brentano said that\nevery psychical phenomenon is characterized by \u201cintentional\ninexistence\u201d. He went on to say that this intentional\ninexistence is \u201cexclusively peculiar to psychical phenomena. No\nphysical phenomenon shows anything similar\u201d.\n\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis not entirely clear, but its importance should\nbe obvious. Suppose that every psychological fact somehow involves\nsomething with intentional inexistence (however precisely this is to\nbe construed). Suppose that no physical fact involves a thing with\nintentional inexistence. Then it would follow that no psychological\nfact can be identified with a physical fact; one version of the\npsycho-physical identity theory would be false; physicalism of some\npopular varieties would be untenable.\n\nChisholm was fascinated by Brentano\u2019s Thesis. He published a\nseries of papers on the topic, starting in 1952 and carrying on until\nat least 1981. In his papers Chisholm formulated precise versions of\nBrentano\u2019s thesis. Each paper provoked critical reaction from\nother philosophers. Since in some cases the criticisms were cogent,\nChisholm was motivated to develop new and more ingenious versions of\nthe Thesis.\n\nTracing all the different ways in which Chisholm attempted to\nformulate Brentano\u2019s Thesis would require a book-length\ndiscussion. Instead, we here focus on one illustrative example. In\nChapter 11 of [PPS], Chisholm developed a version of Brentano\u2019s\nThesis that turned on the notion of an intentional sentence.\nHe identified three marks of intentionality. Any noncompound sentence\nthat manifested one of these marks would be identified as an\nintentional sentence. The first mark of intentionality recalls\nBrentano\u2019s idea of intentional inexistence. Consider the\nsentence \u2018John is thinking about the Loch Ness Monster\u2019.\nNeither this sentence nor its negation entails either that the Monster\nexists or that it does not exist. Any such simple declarative sentence\nis intentional.\n\nThe second mark of intentionality is closely related, but involves\nwhole propositional clauses rather than mere singular terms. Consider\nthe sentence \u2018John wonders whether there is a monster in Loch\nNess.\u2019 Neither this sentence nor its negation entails either\nthat there is a monster in Loch Ness or that there is not such a\nmonster. Any simple sentence that displays this feature is also\nintentional.\n\nThe third mark of intentionality involves the failure of\nsubstitutivity for coextensive singular terms. In fact Eisenhower was\nthe man who would succeed Truman as President of the United States.\nHowever, from the fact that we knew that Eisenhower was in command of\nthe Army, it does not follow that we knew that the man who would\nsucceed Truman was in command of the Army.\n\nThese three marks of intentionality apply only to noncompound\nsentences. A compound sentence counts as intentional if and only if\none of its components is intentional. Thus, \u2018if Parsifal sought\nthe Holy Grail, then he was a Christian\u2019 is intentional because\nits antecedent is intentional. The antecedent carries the first mark\nof intentionality because neither it nor its negation entails either\nthat the Holy Grail exists or that it does not exist.\n\nChisholm then says \u2014 somewhat cautiously \u2014 that a thesis\n\u201cresembling that of Brentano\u201d may be stated in this way:\nwe can express all of our beliefs about physical phenomena without the\nuse of intentional sentences; but when we describe psychological\nattitudes, then we must either use intentional sentences or else make\nuse of other terms that are not needed for the description of physical\nphenomena. In his discussion, it appears that when Chisholm speaks of\n\u2018terms that are not needed for the description of physical\nphenomena\u2019 he has in mind terms that are ultimately definable\nonly by the use of intentional sentences.\n\nChisholm recognizes that we sometimes use intentional sentences to\ndescribe nonpsychological facts. For example, consider the sentence\n\u2018This weapon, suitably placed, is capable of making it be the\ncase that Boston is destroyed.\u2019 Neither that sentence nor its\nnegation entails either that Boston is destroyed or that Boston is not\ndestroyed. So it carries the second mark of intentionality. But it\nseems not to be psychological. Chisholm claims that we can rephrase\nthe sentence nonintentionally: \u2018If this weapon were suitably\nplaced, then Boston would be destroyed.\u2019 This is a compound\nsentence. Reflection will reveal that neither component carries any of\nthe marks of intentionality. (The critic may wonder whether this reply\nis entirely satisfactory, since it may seem that the paraphrase does\nnot mean precisely what the original meant.)\n\nAnother difficult class of sentences involves statements of\nprobability. Consider this example cited by David Sanford: \u2018It\nis not probable that Providence will be hit by a comet in the\n21st Century\u2019. Neither this sentence nor its negation\nentails either that Providence will be hit or that it won\u2019t be\nhit; thus the sentence carries the second mark of intentionality. Yet\nit seems to be nonpsychological.\n\nAt the time of [PPS] Chisholm already recognized that this formulation\nof Brentano\u2019s Thesis was problematic. He mentioned\n\u2018sentences describing relations of comparison\u2019 as a\ndifficulty. Consider the sentence \u2018This lizard looks something\nlike the Loch Ness Monster\u2019. Neither that sentence nor its\nnegation entails either that the Loch Ness Monster exists or that it\ndoes not exist. Yet there seems to be nothing psychological about the\nstatement that the lizard looks something like the Monster.\n\nOver a period of more than thirty years, Chisholm formulated and\nreformulated Brentano\u2019s Thesis. Perhaps the most insightful\ndiscussion of his views and their connections can be found in David\nSanford\u2019s \u2018Chisholm on Brentano\u2019s Thesis\u2019. In\nreply to that essay, Chisholm said, \u2018Anyone who wants to\nunderstand what I have been up to in trying to formulate criteria of\nintentionality, should read Sanford\u2019s paper\u2019 ([LLP],\n215).\n9. Metaphysics V \u2014 \u201cChisholm\u2019s Paradox\u201d\n\nChisholm\u2019s paper \u201cIdentity through Possible Worlds: Some\nQuestions\u201d (1967b) was the lead article in the first issue the\nnew journal No\u00fbs in 1967. In that article, Chisholm\npresented an argument that provoked a remarkable amount of discussion\nand debate. A variant of the argument was subsequently presented in\nChisholm\u2019s \u201cParts as Essential to Their Wholes\u201d,\nwhich was Chisholm\u2019s Presidential Address at the Metaphysical\nSociety of America in 1973. This essay corresponds closely to Appendix\nB of [P&O]. The puzzles presented in those papers have come to be\nknown as versions of \u201cChisholm\u2019s Paradox\u201d (though it\nmust be pointed out that the term \u2018Chisholm\u2019s\nParadox\u2019 is also widely taken to refer to the problem about\ncontrary to duty imperatives that is discussed below in Section\n11).\n\nChisholm\u2019s target in the 1967b paper was a popular collection of\nviews about the metaphysics of modality. Many philosophers \u2014\ngoing back perhaps to Leibniz \u2014 seem to presuppose these views\nin their discussions of necessity and possibility. The central\ndoctrine is that there are many possible worlds. The actual world is\njust one among them, distinguished by the fact that what happens here\nis what actually happens. To say that a statement is true is\njust to say that it is true at the actual world. To say that\na statement is possible is just to say that it is true at\nsome possible world. To say that a statement is necessary is just\nto say that it is true at every possible world. Thus we have\nan account of de dicto modality.\n\nOn one typical construal, it is assumed that an individual who exists\nhere at the actual world also exists at many other possible worlds.\nWhen we say that a certain individual actually has a certain\nproperty, we mean that he has that property at the actual world. To\nsay that he possibly has that property is just to say that he\nhas that property at some possible world. To say that he\nnecessarily has that property is just to say that he has that\nproperty at every possible world where he exists at all. This\ngives us an account of de re modality. But it also generates\nquestions.\n\nChisholm imagines that Adam and Noah exist here in the actual world,\nw1, and that each of them has his own collection\nof properties. He assumes (following Genesis 5) that Adam\nactually lives to the age of 930 years, whereas Noah lives to the age\nof 950 years. Chisholm asks us to imagine a nearby possible world in\nwhich Adam lives one more year, dying at age 931 instead of 930, and\nin which Noah lives one year less, dying at age 949 instead of 950. By\nimagining further similar one year alterations in life-span, we\nfinally reach a possible world in which Adam lives to the age of 950\nand Noah lives to the age of 930. Thus, in that world Adam and Noah\nhave \u201cswapped ages\u201d. In that world Adam has the age that\nNoah has in w1, and Noah has the age that Adam has\nin w1.\n\nChisholm then continues by imagining a series of worlds in which Adam\nand Noah gradually swap letters in their names. This series ends with\na world in which they have \u201cswapped names\u201d altogether. In\nthat world, Adam is called \u2018Noah\u2019, and Noah is called\n \u2018Adam\u2019.[5]\n Going still further, Chisholm imagines a world,\nwn, in which Adam and Noah have swapped\nall their qualitative properties, so that in\nwn Adam has all the properties that Noah\nhas in w1, and Noah has all the properties that\nAdam has in w1. Then Chisholm asks a series of\ntough questions:\n\nShould we say of the Adam of wn that he\nis identical with the Noah of w1 and should we say\nof the Noah of wn that he is identical\nwith the Adam of w1? In other words, is there an\nx such that x is Adam in w1 and\nx is Noah in wn, and is there a\ny such that y is Noah in w1 and\ny is Adam in wn? And how are we\nto decide? \u2026 aren\u2019t the two Adams, the two Noahs, and the\ntwo worlds indiscernible? Could God possibly have had a sufficient\nreason for creating w1 instead of\nwn? (3\u20134)\n\nChisholm extends the example. He points out that what has happened to\nAdam and Noah could happen to anyone. Let us say that a person\u2019s\n\u201crole\u201d in a world is defined by the set of qualitative\nproperties he has there. We can say that a possible world,\nws, is a \u201crole swapping\nworld\u201d of the actual world, w1, just in case\nthe roles being played in ws are\nprecisely the same as the roles being played in\nw1, but at least some of those roles are being\nplayed in ws by someone other than the\nperson who plays the role in w1. Role swapping\nworlds will therefore be indiscernible from each other and from the\nactual world except for the bare identities of the individuals playing\nthe roles. Chisholm says:\n\n\u2026 there may be good ground for the existentialist\u2019s\nangst; since, it would seem, God could have had no sufficient\nreason for choosing the world in which you play your present role\ninstead of one in which you play mine. (4)\n\n\nChisholm\u2019s remarks strongly suggest that he takes these\nquestions to indicate that there is something deeply problematic about\nthe notion that the same individual can exist in different worlds with\ndifferent qualitative properties. Once we accept this notion, we seem\nto be on a path that will eventually lead us to the conclusion that\nthere are indefinitely many worlds each of which is qualitatively\nindiscernible from the real world, but differing from it only in the\nidentities of the individuals playing the various roles. Such a\nplurality of worlds seems undetectable and pointless.\n\nIn \u201cParts as Essential to Their Wholes\u201d (1973), Chisholm\npresents a structurally similar argument for a similar point. In this\ncase, however, Chisholm\u2019s target is a doctrine that he calls\n\u2018complete, unbridled mereological inessentialism\u2019. This is\nthe view that nothing has its parts essentially \u2014 anything\nthat\u2019s made of parts could have been made of different\nparts.\n\nChisholm starts his argument by sketching some outlandish examples,\nbut then he turns to a familiar case. He asks us to consider a pair of\ntables, x and y. Each table is made of smaller\nparts. Just as he did in the case of Adam and Noah, Chisholm imagines\na series of small changes. Instead of gradual changes of properties,\nhe here imagines gradual changes of parts. First, he describes a\npossible in world in which x and y have exchanged\none small part. Then he describes further possible worlds in which\nmore small parts are exchanged. At last we reach a possible world in\nwhich x and y have exchanged all their parts:\neverything that is actually a part of x has now become a part\nof y; and everything that is actually a part of y\nhas now become a part of x.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why Chisholm finds this example perplexing.\nFor we have arrived at a world at which the table that is identified\nas x is composed of all and only the parts that in fact\ncompose y; and the table that is identified as y is\ncomposed of all and only the parts that in fact compose x. Is\nthis world in fact distinct from the actual world? What possible basis\nis there for saying that the table composed of the x parts is\ny? Why isn\u2019t that table x? It is partwise\nindiscernible from the actual x.\n\nChisholm concludes this discussion by saying that \u201cthese\nreflections, on the consequences of extreme mereological\ninessentialism, may suggest to us that some version of\nmereological essentialism must be true\u2026\u201d (586). In the\nremaining pages of the paper Chisholm presents a view according to\nwhich extreme mereological essentialism is true \u2014 but only for\nwhat he calls \u201cprimary objects\u201d. Ordinary or\n\u201cvulgar\u201d objects such as tables and ships are not primary\nobjects. Each such vulgar object may be understood to be a gradually\nevolving sequence of primary objects. The vulgar object is constituted\nby different primary objects at different times. Vulgar objects can\ngain and lose parts across times and possible worlds. Mereological\nessentialism is not true for them.\n\nChisholm strongly suggests that he thinks that vulgar objects occupy a\ndecidedly lower rung on the ontological ladder. In a discussion of an\nexample involving a statue and a hunk of metal that temporarily\nconstitutes it, he suggests that we might be content to say that the\nhunk of metal is a primary object and that this hunk of metal\ntemporarily has the property of being statuesque. In the\nstrict and philosophical sense, it would be acceptable to say that\nthere really is no such thing as \u201cthe statue\u201d. Yet another\npossible view would maintain that the statue is merely a mode of the\nhunk of metal. This too would diminish the ontological status of the\nstatue, though it would not banish the statue entirely. This latter\n\u201cmodal\u201d view is explicitly defended in Chisholm\u2019s\n1986 \u201cSelf-Profile\u201d in [RMCp].\n\nChisholm discussed these problems in a number of papers and chapters.\nHe did not always defend precisely the same combination of views, but\ncertain elements seemed to persist. He steadily maintained a\ncommitment to mereological essentialism for ontologically fundamental\nphysical objects; he tried in various ways to account for facts about\npersistence, enumeration, and reidentification of ordinary objects by\nappeal to what he took to be ontologically more fundamental facts\nabout real \u201csubstances\u201d. Chisholm\u2019s work on these\ntopics was remarkably provocative. Some have suggested that David\nLewis\u2019s development of counterpart theory was intended (among\nother things) to provide a metaphysical account of the structure of\npossible worlds that would avoid the strange implications that\nChisholm described.\n10. Ethics I \u2014 Intrinsic Value, Defeat, Theodicy\n\nA reader starting out with [B&IV] for the first time might not\nanticipate how it is going to end. Indeed, even as the reader\npatiently works his way through definitions, principles, remarks about\nwhat Brentano might have said, etc., the eventual point remains in the\nbackground. Nevertheless, as becomes clear in the final pages, the\nbook as a whole may be seen as one long argument for a distinctive\nsolution to the problem of evil.\n\nChisholm starts by explicating some of Brentano\u2019s idiosyncratic\nmetaphysical views. Soon, however, Chisholm turns to some central\nethical doctrines. Perhaps the first among these involves the\nintroduction of the concept of correctness. In the first\ninstance, we think of certain judgments as being correct. Thus, for\nexample, suppose it now seems to me that I am seeing something red. If\nI judge that I am now seeing something red, it will be clear to me\nthat my judgment is correct. If another person judges that I am not\nseeing something red, it will be clear to me that his judgment is\nincorrect. A similar thing could happen in the case of a judgment to\nthe effect that all squares are rectangles. If I make that judgment\nwith full understanding of the concepts of squareness and\nrectangularity, it will be clear to me that my judgment is correct.\nBrentano evidently made use of this concept of correct judgment in an\nattempt to explain the notion of truth.\n\nChisholm claims that Brentano extended the application of the concept\nof correctness so that it would apply to emotions as well. On\nChisholm\u2019s view, emotions are analogous to judgments in certain\nways. Corresponding to the notion of affirmation or \u201cpositive\njudgment\u201d we have the notion of love, or positive emotion.\nCorresponding to the notion of denial we have the notion of hatred, or\nnegative emotion. In addition, there is the concept of preference. If\nI love one thing and hate another, then I prefer the one to the other.\nSimilarly if I love one thing and am neutral about (neither loving nor\nhating) the other, then I prefer the one to the other. And if I am\nneutral about one thing and hate the other, then I prefer the one to\nthe other. So we have the concept of preference as well.\n\nSuppose I feel some pleasure. Suppose I love the fact that I am\nfeeling that pleasure. Suppose my love of this pleasure is intrinsic\n\u2014 I love the pleasure \u201cin and for itself\u201d. If I\nreflect on this situation, I may recognize that my love is correct.\nThis seems to mean, roughly, that I can see that it is appropriate, or\nfitting, for me to feel this strong pro-attitude toward this\nexperience. The feeling of pleasure deserves, or merits, this sort of\npositive emotional reaction. If another person were to hate that\npleasure, or were to feel an equally strong anti-attitude toward it\n\u201cin and for itself\u201d, his hatred would be incorrect. We can\njust see that a feeling of pleasure does not deserve this sort of\nnegative emotional reaction.\n\nChisholm prefers to formulate these claims about the fittingness of\ncertain emotional reactions to certain objects by appeal to a\nfundamental concept in his ethics. This is the concept of\nrequirement. Instead of saying that it is correct, or\nfitting, to have a certain emotional reaction to a certain object, we\ncan say that contemplation of that object requires that\nemotional reaction. With these concepts at our disposal, Chisholm\nsuggests, we can define all the central concepts of ethics\n([B&IV], 53).\n\nTo say that one thing A is intrinsically better than\nanother thing B, according to Chisholm, is just to say that,\nfor any person, x, contemplation of just A and\nB by x requires that x prefer A to\nB. Consider the fact that there are stones. While of course\nwe might be glad that there are stones in virtue of their usefulness,\nit would not be correct to love this state of affairs for its own\nsake. Mere contemplation of this state of affairs does not require\neither love or hate. It seems to be intrinsically neutral. An\nintrinsically good thing is one that is intrinsically better than a\nneutral thing; an intrinsically bad thing is one such that an\nintrinsically neutral thing is intrinsically better than it. Thus\naccording to Chisholm we may define intrinsic goodness, badness, and\nneutrality entirely in terms of preference and requirement.\n\nIn some cases a complex state of affairs contains some good parts and\nsome bad parts. We can assign positive numbers to the good parts and\nnegative numbers to the bad parts in order to represent their\nrespective amounts of intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of the\nwhole state of affairs may just be the sum of the values of those\nparts. In such cases Chisholm would say that the positive value of the\ngood parts is \u201cbalanced off\u201d by the negative value of the\nbad parts.\n\nIn other cases the interaction among the parts is not in this way just\na matter of summation. Chisholm asks us to compare two cases. In Case\n1, I take pleasure in what I take to be Smith\u2019s pleasure. In\nCase 2, I take an equal amount of pleasure in what I take to be\nJones\u2019s pain. So here we are comparing two instances of\npleasure. Imagine that they are alike in what we may call the\n\u201craw amount\u201d of pleasure involved. They differ in that one\nis pleasure in something good whereas the other is pleasure in\nsomething bad. Chisholm stipulates that the objects of these pleasures\n(Smith\u2019s pleasure and Jones\u2019s pain) are \u201cintentional\nobjects\u201d \u2014 I take them to be happening, but I may be\nmistaken. Maybe they are just figments of my imagination.\n\nFollowing Brentano (and Moore as well) Chisholm assumes that pleasure\nin the good is extra good, while pleasure in the bad is not so good.\nIn these cases the value of the whole is either greater than, or less\nthan, the sum of the values of the parts. (Since Jones\u2019s pain is\nan intentional object of my pleasure in Case 2, its actual occurrence\nis not entailed by the fact that I take pleasure in it; hence,\naccording to Chisholm, it is not a \u201cpart\u201d of the that\nlarger state of affairs.) As a result, Case 1 is better than Case 2 in\nspite of the fact that Case 1 and Case 2 contain the same parts, with\nthe same values. The difference in value arises because of the\nappropriateness of the object of pleasure in Case 1, and the\ncorresponding inappropriateness of the object of the pleasure in Case\n2.\n\nCase 2 illustrates what Chisholm calls \u201cthe defeat of\ngood\u201d. Case 2 contains a good part and no bad part; but the\nvalue of the whole is less than the value of the good part. Somehow,\nthe value of the good part has been defeated without being balanced\noff.\n\nThe defeat of evil would occur in a case in which some state of\naffairs contains a bad part that is worse than the whole, even though\nthe whole does not contain any good part that balances off the evil of\nthe bad part. Consider Case 3 in which I take pain in what I take to\nbe my bad behavior. The badness of my pain may be mitigated by the\nfact that the object of this pain is something that requires that pain\nbe taken in it \u2014 my own bad behavior. But it is possible that I\nam mistaken about my bad behavior; maybe it never really happened.\nThus, Case 3 does not contain that bad behavior as an actual part. The\nstate of affairs may have no good part to balance off the badness of\nmy pain, and yet it may be, as a whole, not as bad as its worst part.\n(It may be neutral; or even good.)\n\nIn the final five pages of [B&IV], Chisholm turns to theodicy. He\nraises the question whether an omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent\ndeity could create a world that contains some things that are\nintrinsically evil. Standard theistic answers are quickly rejected.\n(1) We cannot claim that evil is just an illusion, for in the case of\npain (for example) it is evident to the one who suffers it that it is\ngenuinely evil. Nor can we say (2) that some evils are required as\nmeans to good. For if God is omnipotent, he could find a way to\nproduce the good without making use of the evil means. (3) Some might\nsay that God produces only \u201cpositive\u201d states, such as\nexperiences of pleasure. The evil in the world occurs in\n\u201cnegative\u201d states, and these are not due to God\u2019s\ncreative efforts. But Chisholm points out that the negation of a good\nstate is neutral, not bad. Furthermore, the actual existence of pain\nis not a mere negation. It is as \u201cpositive\u201d as the\nexistence of pleasure. (4) Some have claimed that God gave us freedom,\nwhich we then misused. Thus, it\u2019s not God\u2019s fault that\nthere is evil in this world. But this \u201cfree will defense\u201d\nis quickly rejected. The problem is that if God is omnipotent, he\ncould have created a different world in which we always freely choose\nto act in the better way. Surely there must be such a world; surely it\nmust be better than the actual world in which we freely misbehave. Why\ndidn\u2019t God actualize a world like that?\n\nChisholm then sketches his own solution to the problem of evil. He\nsays \u2018Some of the evil in the world is necessary for the\nenhancement of goodness. And the rest of the evil is defeated\u2019\n([B&IV], 100). In a characteristically careful way, Chisholm does\nnot assert that all the evil in this world is actually to be explained\nin this way. He restricts himself to suggesting that Brentano would\nhave said such a thing, and that the conceptual machinery he has\ndeveloped shows us how it is possible that the world could contain\nsome evil even though the world was created by an omnipotent,\nomniscient, and benevolent god. Whether the evil in this world is in\nfact defeated is another question. Chisholm concludes by saying\n\u2018The wise theodicist, I should think, would say that he\ndoesn\u2019t know\u2019 ([B&IV], 102).\n11. Ethics II \u2014 Contrary to Duty Imperatives\n\nOne of Chisholm\u2019s most influential critical papers in ethics is\n\u201cContrary-to-Duty Imperatives and Deontic Logic\u201d. A number\nof philosophers had noted the analogy between statements of necessity\n(e.g., \u2018it\u2019s necessary that red things are\ncolored.\u2019) and statements of obligation (e.g., \u2018it\u2019s\nobligatory that promises are kept.\u2019) They also noted the\nstructural similarities between the alethic modalities of necessity,\npossibility, and impossibility and the deontic modalities of\nobligation, permission, and prohibition. It\u2019s natural to think\nthat alethic necessity can be understood as truth at all possible\nworlds. So, by analogy, some suggested systems of deontic logic in\nwhich obligation would be understood as truth at all morally perfect\nworlds. Statements of permission (and prohibition), would be taken to\nmean respectively truth at some (or no) morally perfect worlds. This\ngenerates a straightforward deontic logic.\n\nChisholm recognized, however, that any system based on those\nassumptions (and making use of the standard connectives) would be\nunable to express certain familiar and important facts. Among these is\nthe fact that in many cases our moral obligations depend essentially\nupon our moral failings. For example, a person might have a moral\nobligation to apologize for some misbehavior \u2014 yet obviously he\nwould not be apologizing in a morally perfect world, since in such a\nworld he would not have misbehaved in the first place. Presumably,\nthere are no apologies in a morally perfect world. If we let\n\u2018O(Smith apologizes)\u2019 express the idea that there\nis a moral obligation for Smith to apologize, then the imagined\nsemantics would apparently be unable to account for the possibility\nthat the statement could be true. Smith does not apologize for\nanything at any morally perfect world.\n\nChisholm sketched a situation in which a person, (we can call him\n\u2018Smith\u2019), had (a) an obligation to go to the aid of his\nneighbor, (we can call him \u2018Jones\u2019). Assuming that it\nwould be best to notify Jones beforehand, Chisholm imagined that (b)\nSmith also had a conditional obligation to notify Jones in advance if\nhe was going to come to his aid. On the other hand, (c) if he was\ngoing to fail to come to Jones\u2019s aid, then Smith\u2019s\nobligation would be to avoid telling him that he was coming to his\naid. Finally, Chisholm assumed that (d) Smith was going to fail to\ncome to Jones\u2019s aid.\n\nThere is nothing incoherent or even surprising about the situation\nChisholm described, yet there seemed to be no adequate way to express\nthese statements in any extant system of deontic logic. No matter how\nthe obligation operators, material and formal conditionals, temporal\nrestrictions, etc. were juggled, the formal-language sentences simply\ndid not preserve the logical features of the familiar ordinary\nlanguage sentences. Consider, for example, the following\nsentences:\n\n\n(a1) O(Smith goes to the aid of Jones)\n\n(b1) O(Smith goes to the aid of Jones \u2192 Smith tells\nJones he is coming)\n\n(c1) ~(Smith goes to the aid of Jones) \u2192 O(~Smith tells\nJones he is coming)\n\n(d1) ~(Smith goes to the aid of Jones).\n\n\nChisholm pointed out that in many extant systems of deontic logic,\nthere is a general principle (\u201cdeontic detachment\u201d) that\nwould validate the inference from (a1) and (b1) to:\n\n(e1) O(Smith tells Jones he is coming)\n\n\nWhile (c1) and (d1) entail:\n\n(f1) O(~Smith tells Jones he is coming)\n\n\nThe conjunction of (e1) and (f1) is a near contradiction, telling\nSmith that he both has an obligation to warn Jones, and also that he\nhas an obligation not to warn Jones. If we assume that if you have an\nobligation to do something, then you don\u2019t have an obligation to\navoid doing it, we can derive an outright contradiction. Other\npossible representations of the situation fail to preserve other\nlogical features of the original sentences.\n\nPerhaps Chisholm was thinking that this puzzle could be solved by\nappeal to a system of deontic logic based on the notion of\nrequirement. Maybe he thought that a good way to represent the\nsentences in question would be to say (a) that Smith had a\nnon-overridden requirement to go to the aid of Jones; but that (b)\nthat if Smith were going to go to the aid of Jones, then this fact\nwould require that Smith notify Jones in advance; and furthermore (c)\nthat if Smith were not going to go to the aid of Jones, then this fact\nwould require that Smith not notify Jones in advance. Finally, there\nis the stipulation (d) that Smith is not going to go to the aid of\nJones. This solution to Chisholm\u2019s puzzle would be of greatest\ninterest if it could be shown not only to provide a suitable\nsemantical interpretation for the four cited sentences, but also to\npave the way to a complete system of deontic logic adequate for the\nexpression of statements of conditional obligation.\n\nChisholm\u2019s paper had a profound impact. It provoked renewed\ninterest in the logic of obligation. Several philosophers began\nworking on new systems of deontic logic. Many of these new systems\nincorporated a new idea \u2014 conditional obligation. This was\nintended to provide a formal representation for the thought behind\nsuch statements as \u2018if you don\u2019t do what you ought to do,\nthen you ought to apologize\u2019.\n12. Ethics III \u2014 The Ethics of Requirement\n\nAs we noted above in Section 10, Chisholm offered an account of the\nconcept of intrinsic goodness by appeal to the concept of requirement.\nIn some places, Chisholm defended the idea that a thing is\nintrinsically good (bad) when contemplation of just that thing\nrequires that the contemplator loves (hates) it. But Chisholm wanted\nto go much further. In his discussion of these matters in [B&IV]\nChisholm remarks:\n\nThis way of defining intrinsic value, then, makes use of the concept\nof requirement. And there is reason to think that the concept\nof requirement is the central concept of ethics. It yields adequate\ndefinitions of the basic intrinsic value concepts. And it has the\nfollowing advantage as well: It provides a way of reducing the\nconcepts of the theory of value (\u201caxiology\u201d) to those of\nethics (\u201cdeontology\u201d). ([B&IV], 53)\n\n\nIn a couple of papers, Chisholm tried to show how the central concepts\nof axiology and deontology can be defined by appeal to this one\nfundamental concept of requirement. These papers provide beautiful\nillustrations of one of Chisholm\u2019s most characteristic\nphilosophical procedures \u2014 the clear definition of a tangle of\nrelated concepts by appeal to a small set of undefined primitives. In\nthis instance, he tries to explain confusing and problematic concepts\nin the realm of ethics. He makes use of just a few undefined concepts.\nOne of them \u2014 requirement \u2014 seems to carry all of\nthe distinctively normative burden. (It would be interesting to\ncompare Chisholm\u2019s efforts on behalf of requirement in\nethics with his efforts on behalf of more reasonable than in\nepistemology. The projects seem to illustrate the same methodological\npropensity.)\n\nIn \u201cThe Ethics of Requirement\u201d, Chisholm uses\n\u2018pRq\u2019 to abbreviate \u2018p would\nrequire q\u2019. The relevant concept of requirement is\noperative in the statement \u2018If I were to promise to meet you for\nlunch that would require my meeting you for lunch.\u2019 An actual\nrequirement for q comes into being when q is\nrequired by something, p, and p actually occurs.\nThus, if I actually did promise to meet you for lunch, then there is a\nrequirement that I show up. But even if actual, the requirement is\ndefeasible. It may be overridden. When an action is actually required\nin this way, it counts at least as a prima facie obligation. If I meet\nan injured stranger on the way to lunch, and I alone am qualified to\ntend to his injuries, then this further state of affairs overrides my\nprima facie obligation to meet you for lunch. In light of this,\nChisholm defines all-in, or all things considered, obligation as\nnon-overridden requirement. In other words:\n\nq is all things considered obligatory =df \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2203p(pRq & p occurs &\n~\u2203s(s occurs &\n~((p&s)Rq)))\n\n\nThis concept of obligation is not restricted to actions. It is a\nconcept of the \u201cought to be\u201d. In order to explain the\n\u201cought to do\u201d, Chisholm introduces another operator,\n\u2018A\u2019. \u2018Ap\u2019 expresses the idea\nthat a person S succeeds in bringing about the state\nof affairs p. Making use this further expression, Chisholm\ndefines the ought to do by saying that the statement that S\nought to bring about some state of affairs p just means\nOAp.\n\nOnce we have a definition of all things considered obligation, it is\neasy enough to define permission, forbiddenness, and gratuitousness.\nChisholm does this in the expected ways.\n\nA person has a prima facie obligation to do something when his doing\nit is required by something that happens. An all-in obligation arises\nwhen there is a non-overridden requirement for him to do it. Chisholm\nclaims that this helps to solve the puzzle about conflicts of\nobligation. Obviously, there can be conflicts of prima facie\nobligation. But there cannot be conflicts of all-in obligation.\n\nIn addition, Chisholm attempts to apply his conceptual scheme to some\nother long-standing puzzles in ethics. Among these is a puzzle about\nsupererogatory action. A supererogatory action is supposedly one that\nis \u201cbeyond the call of duty\u201d \u2014 something that would\nbe outstandingly good to do, but permissible to fail to do.\nConsequentialists have a hard time explaining how there could be any\nsuch things, since they typically say that duty requires us to do the\nbest we can. How can there be anything \u201cbeyond\u201d that? And\nhow could it be permissible to fail to do such a thing, if it is\n\u201cextra good\u201d?\n\nChisholm proposes to explain this by saying that a certain action is\nsupererogatory when its \u201cobject\u201d absolutely ought to be,\nbut its agent is neither obligated to bring it about nor to refrain\nfrom bringing it about. He uses \u2018PAq\u2019 to\nabbreviate \u2018S is permitted to bring about\nq\u2019, where permission is understood to be the absence of\nobligation to refrain:\n\nS\u2019s doing q is supererogatory\n=df Oq & P~Aq &\nPAq\n\n\nIn subsequent papers, Chisholm made further claims about the\nusefulness of his concept of requirement.\n13. Evolution and Criticism of Chisholm\u2019s Views\n\nChisholm continued to work on a multitude of philosophical projects\nover a period of many years. Though his central convictions remained\nrelatively stable, he steadily revised the details of his formulations\nin light of criticism from others and as a result of his own\nreconsideration. Thus it is difficult to identify any chapter or paper\nas containing the final, official version of his view.\n\nNevertheless, there are several more or less fundamental Chisholmian\ndoctrines. We have sketched some of these doctrines. Here, we list\nsome things that Chisholm wrote in which he discussed the doctrines.\nWe go on to mention some books and papers by others in which they\noffer exposition or criticism of Chisholm\u2019s views.\n\nIn epistemology, Chisholm took as his fundamental primitive concept\nthe idea we express when we say that believing p is more\nreasonable for S than believing q would be. He tried to define\nother terms of epistemic evaluation by appeal to this one.\nFurthermore, he assumed that we in fact do know many of the things we\ntake ourselves to know. He thought that a person can be justified in\nbelieving many foundational propositions about his own current mental\nstate. He took one of the central projects of epistemology to be the\nformulation of epistemic principles that would show how we become\njustified in believing things about the external world, the past, and\nother problematic things on the basis of this present, internal,\nself-oriented foundation.\n\nAn early formulation of Chisholm\u2019s view can be found in [PPS].\nSubsequent formulations were presented in the three editions of [TK]\nas well as in [FK]. [FK] is a collection of essays in epistemology.\nSome were newly written for [FK], but most were slightly revised\nversions of articles that Chisholm had already published. [FK] is thus\na comprehensive presentation of Chisholm\u2019s distinctive views in\nepistemology.\n\nThree excellent critical discussions are Heidelberger (1969), Foley\n(1997), and Sosa (1997). For comprehensive examinations of\nChisholm\u2019s epistemology, see Legum (2021 [Other Internet\nResources]) and the papers in [PLRMC].\n\nOne issue in Chisholm\u2019s epistemological work that has been\nwidely discussed is the problem of the criterion. Chisholm thought\nthat the problem arises because the fundamental problems of\nepistemology were \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d and \u201cWhat are\nthe criteria for knowledge?\u201d and he argued that an answer to\neither one required a prior answer to the other. He contended that the\nproblem could be addressed only by begging the question. He defended\nthe common-sense view that we do know most of what common-sense says\nwe know. For discussion, see Amico (1993), Lemos (2004), and McCain\n(2014 [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nIn metaphysics, Chisholm maintained that certain things are genuinely\npersisting \u201csubstances\u201d. Such things literally last\nthrough time and survive changes in their properties. Each person is\nsuch a being, retaining his or her strict identity over time. On the\nother hand, ordinary physical objects can be said to persist only in\nan extended sense. Since it has undergone changes of parts,\ntoday\u2019s chair is only \u201cloosely identical\u201d with\nyesterday\u2019s chair. Chisholm thought that a complex thing could\nstrictly persist only if it retained all of its parts. Thus, he\nendorsed mereological essentialism. He thought that persons would have\nto be ontologically simple in order for it to be possible for them to\nmaintain strict identity over time and through change. Thus, we are\nnot to be identified with our bodies.\n\nAn excellent presentation of Chisholm\u2019s views on these matters\ncan be found in [P&O], as well as in his papers \u201cIs There a\nMind-Body Problem?\u201d (1978) and \u201cOn the Simplicity of the\nSoul\u201d (1991). Chapters 4, 6, 7, and 13 of [OM] are especially\nhelpful. For a brief final discussion of the metaphysics of persons,\nsee \u201cPersons and Their Bodies: Some Unanswered Questions\u201d\n(1996).\n\nPlantinga (1975) contains a clear and helpful discussion of\nChisholm\u2019s views about mereological essentialism. For a\ndrammatically non-Chisholmian view concerning the relation between a\nperson and that person\u2019s body, see Baker (2002). Although he did\nnot explictly say that he was presenting an objection to\nChisholm\u2019s view, Derek Parfit also defended a radically\ndifferent approach to the nature of persons and the conditions for\n\u201cpersonal identity\u201d in Parfit (1971).\n\nFor a penetrating critical discussion of Chisholm\u2019s metaphysics\nof persons, see Quinn (1997).\n\nAnother metaphysical view that evidently fascinated Chisholm is\nlibertarianism. According to this view, there is a special sort of\ncausation in which an event is caused at least in part by an agent.\nWhen an agent thus \u201cimminently\u201d helps to bring about some\neffect, his doing so is not determined by antecedent causal\nconditions. Thus, he freely makes something happen. This makes genuine\nmoral responsibility possible.\n\nAn early defense of this libertarianism can be found in \u201cFreedom\nand Action\u201d (1966). Another classic statement of the view can be\nfound in Chisholm\u2019s \u201cHe Could Have Done Otherwise\u201d\n(1967a). Chisholm discussed these ideas in greater detail in Chapter\nII of [P&O] and then again in Chapters 1 and 2 of [OM]. For\nfurther helpful work, including Chisholm\u2019s \u201cHuman Freedom\nand the Self,\u201d see Ekstrom (2000). See also Zimmerman (2010) and\nvon Wachter (2003).\n\nChisholm\u2019s views in ontology underwent steady pruning. In an\nearlier period he believed in necessarily existent states of affairs\nsome of which might occur and recur. He also believed in times, though\nnot in \u201cconcrete events\u201d. Later he abandoned times and\nrecurrable states of affairs in favor of a sparser ontology including\n\u201cone shot\u201d states, but lacking times. The earlier view can\nbe found in \u201cEvents and Propositions\u201d (1970), and\n\u201cStates of Affairs Again\u201d (1971), and Chapter IV of\n[P&O]. The later view appears in \u201cEvents without Times: An\nEssay in Ontology\u201d (1990). See also Chapter 16 of [OM] and\nChapter 10 of [RTC].\n\nKim 1979 contains a very helpful critical exposition of\nChisholm\u2019s early view. Both views are discussed in Brandl 1997.\nSee also Zimmerman (1997), Rosenkrantz (1998), and Steen (2008).\n\nChisholm was dubious about such things as sense data, appearances, the\n\u201clooks\u201d of things. He defended a different view about the\nontology of perception. An amusing early paper on this topic is\n\u201cThe Problem of the Speckled Hen\u201d (1942). A more extended\ndiscussion, including a presentation of Chisholm\u2019s preferred\ntheory of appearing, can be found in Chapter 8 (\u201cSensing\u201d)\nof [PPS]. More than forty years later, near the end of his career,\nChisholm made some final remarks about appearances in Chapter 13 of\n[RTC].\n\nChisholm steadily thought there is something fundamentally right about\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis \u2014 the idea that the psychological\nsomehow involves intentionality, and that in this respect it is unlike\nthe purely physical. Chisholm discussed this idea in his early paper\n\u201cSentences about Believing\u201d (1955\u20136). He discussed\nit again in Chapter 11 (\u201cIntentional Inexistence\u201d) of\n[PPS]. A summary statement of the view can also be found in\nChisholm\u2019s article \u201cIntentionality\u201d (1967c).\nChisholm returned to this topic in Part IV (Chapters 10\u201314) of\n[OM].\n\nTwo excellent critical discussions of Brentano\u2019s Thesis are\nSanford 1997 and Kim 2003.\n\nThe term \u2018Chisholm\u2019s Paradox\u2019 has been credited to\nGraeme Forbes in his \u201cTwo Solutions to Chisholm\u2019s\nParadox\u201d (1984) The topic has been discussed extensively; see,\nfor example, Salmon 1996. In his discussion of the mereological\nversion of the puzzle, Chisholm mentions Chandler 1966. Lewis 1986 is\nessential reading here. A good discussion of the whole problem of\ntransworld identity can be found in Mackie 2008.\n\nOne central Chisholmian view in ethics is the idea that all the main\nconcepts of ethics can be defined by appeal to the concept of\nrequirement. He defends this idea in his early paper\n\u201cThe Ethics of Requirement\u201d (1964) and then again ten\nyears later in \u201cPractical Reason and the Logic of\nRequirement\u201d (1974). The idea is briefly mentioned, but not\ndeveloped, in [B&IV] 53. See also Chisholm (2005).\n\nFor quite a long time Chisholm thought that the fundamental bearers of\nintrinsic value are states of affairs. He also thought that in some\ncases, the value of a state of affairs could be defeated by that\nstate\u2019s occurrence within some larger context. In this he seemed\nto be working out some ideas of Brentano and Moore. One of\nChisholm\u2019s most moving presentations of this view can be found\nin his Presidential Address before the Eastern Division of the\nAmerican Philosphical Association titled \u201cThe Defeat of Good and\nEvil\u201d (1968). Many of his ideas about defeat, enhancement,\nmitigation, and organic unities are further developed in Chapters 6,\n7, and 8 of [B&IV]. For further discussion, see Lemos (2005),\nGustafsson (2014), and Tucker (2016).\n\nNo list of Chisholm\u2019s contributions to ethics could be complete\nwithout mentioning \u201cContrary-to-Duty Imperatives and Deontic\nLogic\u201d (1963).\n",
