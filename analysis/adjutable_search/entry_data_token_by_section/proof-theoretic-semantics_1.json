    "main_text": "Background || Inferentialism, intuitionism, anti-realism\n1.2 Inferentialism, intuitionism, anti-realism\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is inherently inferential, as it is\ninferential activity which manifests itself in proofs. It thus belongs\nto inferentialism (a term coined by Brandom, see his 1994;\n2000) according to which inferences and the rules of inference\nestablish the meaning of expressions, in contradistinction to\ndenotationalism, according to which denotations are the\nprimary sort of meaning. Inferentialism and the\n\u2018meaning-as-use\u2019 view of semantics is the broad\nphilosophical framework of proof-theoretic semantics. This general\nphilosophical and semantical perspective merged with constructive\nviews which originated in the philosophy of mathematics, especially in\nmathematical intuitionism. Most forms of proof-theoretic semantics are\nintuitionistic in spirit, which means in particular that principles of\nclassical logic such as the law of excluded middle or the double\nnegation law are rejected or at least considered problematic. This is\npartly due to the fact that the main tool of proof-theoretic\nsemantics, the calculus of natural deduction, is biased towards\nintuitionistic logic, in the sense that the straightforward\nformulation of its elimination rules is the intuitionistic one. There\nclassical logic is only available by means of some rule of indirect\nproof, which, at least to some extent, destroys the symmetry of the\nreasoning principles (see section\n 3.5).\n If one adopts the standpoint of natural deduction, then\nintuitionistic logic is a natural logical system. Also the BHK\n(Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov) interpretation of the logical signs plays\na significant role. This interpretation is not a unique approach to\nsemantics, but comprises various ideas which are often more informally\nthan formally described. Of particular importance is its functional\nview of implication, according to which a proof of \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nis a constructive function which, when applied to a proof of \\(A\\)\nyields a proof of \\(B\\). This functional perspective underlies many\nconceptions of proof-theoretic semantics, in particular those of\nLorenzen, Prawitz and Martin L\u00f6f (see sections\n 2.1.1,\n 2.2.2,\n 2.2.3).\n\nAccording to Dummett (1975), the logical position of intuitionism\ncorresponds to the philosophical position of anti-realism. The realist\nview of a recognition-independent reality is the metaphysical\ncounterpart of the view that all sentences are either true or false\nindependent of our means of recognizing it. Major parts of\nproof-theoretic semantics follow Dummett and his association with\nanti-realism.\n",
