    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues\n5. Philosophical Issues\n\nQuantum gravity raises a number of difficult philosophical questions.\nTo date, it is the ontological aspects of quantum gravity that have\nattracted the most interest from philosophers, and it is these we will\ndiscuss in the first five sections below. In the final section,\nthough, we will briefly discuss some further methodological and\nepistemological issues which arise.\n\nFirst, however, let us discuss the extent to which ontological\nquestions are tied to a particular theoretical framework. In its\ncurrent stage of development, string theory unfortunately provides\nlittle indication of the more fundamental nature of space, time, and\nmatter. Despite the consideration of ever more exotic objects \u2014\nstrings, p-branes, D-branes, etc. \u2014 these objects are\nstill understood as propagating in a background spacetime. Since\nstring theory is supposed to describe the emergence of classical\nspacetime from some underlying quantum structure, these objects are\nnot to be regarded as truly fundamental. Rather, their status in\nstring theory is analogous to the status of particles in quantum field\ntheory (Witten, 2001), which is to say that they are relevant\ndescriptions of the fundamental physics only in situations in which\nthere is a background spacetime with appropriate symmetries. While\nthis suggests tantalising links to issues of emergence, it is\ndifficult to pursue them without knowing the details of the more\nfundamental theory. As already mentioned, the duality relations\nbetween the various string theories suggest that they are all\nperturbative expansions of some more fundamental, non-perturbative\ntheory known as \u2018M-theory\u2019 (Polchinski, 2002, see the\nOther Internet Resources section below). This, presumably, is the most\nfundamental level, and understanding the theoretical framework at that\nlevel is central to understanding the underlying ontology of the\ntheory (and so the manner in which any other structures might emerge\nfrom it). \u2018Matrix theory\u2019 is an attempt to do just this,\nto provide a mathematical formulation of M-theory, but it remains\nhighly speculative. Thus although string theory purports to be a\nfundamental theory, the ontological implications of the theory are\nstill very obscure \u2014 though this could be viewed as a challenge\nrather than a reason to ignore the theory.\n\nCanonical quantum gravity, in its loop formulation or otherwise, has\nto date been of greater interest to philosophers because it appears to\nconfront fundamental questions in a way that string theory, at least\nin its perturbative guise, does not \u2014 certainly, it does so more\nexplicitly and in language more amenable to philosophers. Whereas\nperturbative string theory treats spacetime in an essentially\nclassical way, canonical quantum gravity treats it as\nquantum-mechanical entity, at least to the extent of treating the\ngeometric structure (as opposed to, say, the topological or\ndifferential structure) as quantum-mechanical. Furthermore, many of\nthe issues facing canonical quantum gravity are also firmly rooted in\nconceptual difficulties facing the classical theory, which\nphilosophers are already well acquainted with (e.g. via the\n hole argument).\n",
