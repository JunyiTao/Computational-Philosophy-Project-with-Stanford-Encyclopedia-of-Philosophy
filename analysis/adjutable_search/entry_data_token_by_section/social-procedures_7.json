    "main_text": "The Stable Marriage Problem || A University Housing Assignment Procedure\n3.2 A University Housing Assignment Procedure\n\nUsing the perspective of social software, Parikh and Pauly (2012)\ninvestigate a variant of the\nGale-Shapley algorithm that is used in the Stanford Housing Draw to\nassign students to rooms. The situation is more complex than in the\nmarriage setting, because students do not give a complete order on all\nhouses, but only on 8 of them; moreover, they may choose to enter the\nDraw in groups. In the housing context, the students turn out to have\nan incentive to honestly submit their true preferences: the draw is\nnon-manipulable for them. However, in theory\nthey could still strategize about choosing the subset of 8 houses on\nwhich they submit their preferences.\n\nThe issue of knowledge is interesting in this case. Even though the\nalgorithm can be found on the Stanford webpages, most students and\nadministrators do not fully understand how it works. Therefore, the\nStanford Housing Draw cannot be assumed as common knowledge among the\nstudents. An interesting phenomenon seems to occur: even while\nadmitting not to understand the algorithm, most students would say\nthat they believe it to be fair (Parikh &\nPauly 2012).\n",
