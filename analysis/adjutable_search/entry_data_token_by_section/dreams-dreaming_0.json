    "main_text": "Dreams and epistemology || Cartesian dream skepticism\n1.1 Cartesian dream skepticism\n\nDream skepticism has traditionally been the most famous and widely\ndiscussed philosophical problem raised by dreaming (see Williams 1978;\nStroud 1984). In the Meditations, Descartes uses dreams to\nmotivate skepticism about sensory-based beliefs about the external\nworld and his own bodily existence. He notes that sensory experience\ncan also lead us astray in commonplace sensory illusions such as\nseeing things as too big or small. But he does not think such cases\njustify general doubts about the reliability of sensory perception: by\ntaking a closer look at an object seen under suboptimal conditions, we\ncan easily avoid deception. By contrast, dreams suggest that even in a\nseemingly best-case scenario of sensory perception (Stroud 1984),\ndeception is possible. Even the realistic experience of sitting\ndressed by the fire and looking at a piece of paper in one\u2019s hands\n(Descartes 1641: I.5) is something that can, and according to\nDescartes often does, occur in a dream.\n\nThere are different ways of construing the dream argument. A strong\nreading is that Descartes is trapped in a lifelong dream and none of\nhis experiences have ever been caused by external objects (the\nAlways Dreaming Doubt; see Newman 2019). A weaker reading is\nthat he is just sometimes dreaming but cannot rule out at any given\nmoment that he is dreaming right now (the Now Dreaming Doubt;\nsee Newman 2019). This is still epistemologically worrisome: even\nthough some of his sensory-based beliefs might be true, he cannot\ndetermine which these are unless he can rule out that he is dreaming.\nDoubt is thus cast on all of his beliefs, making sensory-based\nknowledge slip out of reach.\n\nCartesian-style skeptical arguments have the following form (quoted\nfrom Klein 2015):\n\nIf I know that p, then there are no genuine grounds for\ndoubting that p.\nU is a genuine ground for doubting that p.\nTherefore, I do not know that p.\n\n\nIf we apply this to the case of dreaming, we get:\n\nIf I know that I am sitting dressed by the fire, then there are no\ngenuine grounds for doubting that I am really sitting dressed by the\nfire.\nIf I were now dreaming, this would be a genuine ground for\ndoubting that I am sitting dressed by the fire: in dreams, I have\noften had the realistic experience of sitting dressed by the fire when\nI was actually lying undressed in bed!\nTherefore, I do not know that I am now sitting dressed by the\nfire.\n\n\nImportantly, both strong and weak versions of the dream argument cast\ndoubt only on sensory-based beliefs, but leave other beliefs\nunscathed. According to Descartes, that 2+3=5 or that a square has no\nmore than 4 sides is knowable even if he is now dreaming:\n\n\nalthough, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that\nall which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true.\n(Descartes 1641: V.15) \n\n\nBy Descartes\u2019 lights, dreams do not undermine our ability to engage in\nthe project of pure, rational enquiry (Frankfurt 1970; but see\nBroughton 2002).\n",
