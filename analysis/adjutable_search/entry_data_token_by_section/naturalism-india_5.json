There are two\nimportant cosmological theories in the anti-atomic\ncamp\u2014Prak\u1e5bti-pari\u1e47\u0101ma-v\u0101da and\nBrahma-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-v\u0101da. Of these two, the first, a\nS\u0101\u1e43khya view that the world evolves from Ur-Nature or\nprak\u1e5bti, is more relevant in the discussion of naturalism.\nUr-Nature is an ever-dynamic whole of all-pervasive magnitude having\nthree constituent principles or gu\u1e47as, viz. sattva, rajas and\ntamas. Sattva has the power to illuminate, rajas to activate and tamas\nto restraint. B.N. Seal (1958), therefore, thinks that these\nprinciples are three aspects of matter, viz., form, energy and mass.\nK.C. Bhattacharya (1956), on the other hand, has offered a\npsychological interpretation which appears to have a closer fit with\nthe text. Bhattacharya maintains that the S\u0101\u1e43khya considers\nthings of nature as contents of affective experience. Mohanty (1992)\nalso concurs that \u2018the gu\u1e47as are the substantial, but\ndynamic, being of the elementary feelings that constitute, in their\ninterconnections, all experience.\u2019 The gu\u1e47as as affective\nabsolutes constitute the object. In the process of evolution, the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya gives the central role to rajas, which is said to\nbe an ever-active principle of pain. Mohanty explains, following\nBhattacharya, that \u2018since pain implies the active wish to be\nfree from pain, pain is a freeing activity: it is restless willing to\nbe free. Pleasure is restful freedom from pain; indifference is not\nonly want of freedom but is also not actively willing freedom.\u2019\nSo these three constituents of Ur-nature are present in all objects of\nthe world in different proportions and are responsible for our varied\nexperience. This theory of nature is complemented by a theory of\ncausation, viz. satk\u0101ryav\u0101da, which states that an effect\nexists in its cause prior to its production in a latent or\nnon-manifest form.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers advance the following arguments in\nfavour of their theory of causation:\n\nWhat is non-existent cannot\never be produced. Whatever is non-existent remains non-existent for\never and whatever is existent always exists. Nothing can be sometimes\nexistent and sometimes non-existent. Self, for example, is always\nexistent, whereas the fictitious sky-flower is eternally non-existent.\nNo agency can turn non-existent into existent. So if the effect were\nnon-existent in the material cause before the causal operation, then\nit would never be produced.\nIf a particular cause is to be a prior\ndeterminant of a particular effect, then there must be an appropriate\nrelation between cause and effect. That means, a cause produces an\neffect only being related to it. But no such relation can obtain, if\nthe effect were non-existent. For, a relation to obtain requires at\nleast two relata. Hence an effect must pre-exist in its cause.\nMoreover, on the S\u0101\u1e43khya view the relation between cause\nand effect is one of identity (t\u0101d\u0101tmya), and it is obvious\nthat an existent cause cannot be identical to a non-existent effect.\nOne may still wonder, why should not the effect be produced by an\nunrelated cause? The reason is that if the effect could arise without\nbeing related to the cause, then any cause could give rise to any\neffect. If there were no definite relation between threads and cloth,\nthen why does a pot not arise from threads?\nThe opponent might say\nthat the effect need not pre-exist in the material cause because when\nthe cause is potent even a non-existent effect can be made to exist by\nthe causal operation. When, on the other hand, the cause lacks the\npotency the desired effect cannot be produced. Since oil-seeds possess\nthe adequate potency, oil can be produced out of these seeds but not\nout of sand. S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers concede this point and\nmaintain that causal operation enables a potent cause to manifest the\nlatent effect. However, they point out that positing potency or\nefficiency will not satisfy their opponents. For then the question\nwill be: where does this potency exist? The opponent must agree that\nthis potency exists in the material cause. Does this potency have any\nrelation with the effect or not? The answer has to be affirmative,\notherwise we would not have said that oilseeds possess the capacity of\nproducing oil and not pots. So once again we are back to the same\nquestion: how can the potency residing in the material cause be\nrelated with a non-existent effect? The S\u0101\u1e43khyas,\ntherefore, affirm that this causal efficiency is nothing other than\nthe existence of the effect in the material cause in a latent form.\nThe final argument in favour of the S\u0101\u1e43khya position\nreveals the whole issue very pointedly. The effect, they say, exists\nin the material cause because cause and effect are essentially the\nsame but only different in form. Since the cause is existent, the\neffect also must exist. The S\u0101\u1e43khya has a special stake in\nthis point because the whole debate is geared to proving the existence\nof prak\u1e5bti as the ultimate material cause of the universe. In\nthe process they also attempt to establish, contra Ved\u0101nta, that\nthe evolution of the universe is genuine and not merely illusory.\n\n\nThe process of evolution of the world from Ur-Nature is briefly as\nfollows. The first evolute of prak\u1e5bti is the mahat-tattva (the\nGreat Principle, the Cosmic Intelligence or buddhi). From this emerges\nI-consciousness (aha\u1e43k\u0101ra). From the sattva aspect of\nI-consciousness evolve five organs of knowledge (eye, ear, nose,\ntongue and skin), five motor organs (speech, hands, feet, reproductive\nand excretory organs) and manas (sometimes translated as mind); from\nthe tamas aspect of I-consciousness emerge five subtle elements\n(pa\u00f1ca-tanm\u0101tra), viz., sound, touch, colour, taste and\nsmell. The five subtle elements give rise to five gross elements,\nviz., \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, air, fire, water and earth.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that the three constituents of Ur-Nature\nare always in transformation. Before the beginning of creation or\nempirical manifestation of Ur-Nature, there is a homogeneous\ntransformation (sadr\u015ba-pari\u1e47\u0101ma) of the principles,\nsattva transforms into sattva, rajas into rajas and tamas into tamas.\nAt the time of world-manifestation the active principle, rajas,\nbecomes predominant and activates the other two principles. The\nstability of Ur-Nature is disturbed due to its close proximity with\nthe Self (puru\u1e63a), an independent co-eternal reality, like a\npiece of iron in proximity of a magnet, and the process of\nheterogeneous transformation begins. The constituent principles of\nUr-Nature combine with one another in different proportions and the\nmanifold world comes into existence.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya theory of evolution has been described as\nteleological because on this view the entire process of evolution\ntakes place for the sake of the enjoyment and liberation of\npuru\u1e63a, the pure Self. As such, puru\u1e63a stands outside the\nprocess of evolution. When puru\u1e63a is reflected in the first\nevolute of Ur-Nature, cosmic intelligence, it conflates its own\nidentity with the first evolute and appears to have enjoyment and\nsuffering. When it once again comes to realise its own nature by\nattaining discriminatory knowledge, it is liberated. Certainly there\nare problems in the S\u0101\u1e43khya admission of a conscious but\ninactive principle, puru\u1e63a. Puru\u1e63a is eternal and\nubiquitous like prak\u1e5bti, but if these two are always in contact\nthe start of the creation process remains inexplicable. Again, it is\nnot easy to understand why Ur-Nature should ensnare the pure self into\nbondage and then liberate it through discriminatory knowledge.\nS\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers say that the enjoyment of the pure\nself is a sham enjoyment, and so is the liberation because the pure\nself is eternally free. Then, however, the teleology loses its force,\nsomething that is perhaps inevitable because the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nteleology had always been proto-naturalistic, as is evident from two\nexamples used in the literature. Just as non-sentient cow-milk flows\nmerely from its own nature for the nourishment of the young calf and\nnon-sentient rain clouds naturally yield rain for the sustenance of\nlife on earth, so Ur-Nature ensnares the pure self for the\nlatter\u2019s enjoyment and liberation. The S\u0101\u1e43khya theory\nhas never upheld a conscious teleology, rather it has spoken of the\nnatural directedness of Ur-Nature and its evolutes towards\nsatisfaction of another\u2019s need.\n\nThough the later S\u0101\u1e43khya narration embraces a clear-cut\ndualism of Ur-Nature and pure self, Dasgupta (1987) mentioned a\nversion of early S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophy where the self is\nregarded as a non-manifest part of prak\u1e5bti. In this system\nconsciousness exists in the material Ur-Nature in a latent form. This\nmonistic theory is undoubtedly much more consistent; so why did the\nlater S\u0101\u1e43khya change its position to dualism? Dasgupta\nwrites succinctly, \u2018Man\u2019s body so far as it is a physical\nobject is like any other object of nature passing through the process\nof evolution. But the introduction of soul from the organic state\nmarks the epoch of a new kind of progress. This epoch attains it as\nthe highest achievement when it comes to the moral being. So far as\nthe physical world is concerned there is the same law of evolution\nfrom the relatively less differentiated, more determinate, more\ncoherent whole and looked at from this point of view man\u2019s life\nand body are but a part of the universe suffering the same process of\ngrowth and decay. But looked at from another point of view all living\nbeings and man pre-eminently by virtue of his soul, is a person and\nthis addition of personality is a decisive addition. Thus so far as\nthe physical parts and the biological sides of life are concerned he\nis an object of nature, but so far as his soul is concerned he is a\nperson and it is this personality which constitutes his\nspirituality.\u2019 The inexplicability of the normative, especially\nof the moral and the spiritual, a perennial bane of naturalism, thus\nled the proto-naturalist S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers to admit pure\nself passively witnessing the process of evolution and standing\noutside the bounds of Ur-Nature. But that does not make empirical\nconsciousness in any way naturalistically unexplainable. In the world\nprocess, buddhi plays a conscious role, reflecting the pure\nconsciousness, just as the moon lightens up the world by borrowing the\nreflected light of the sun.\n\nA detailed account of self and consciousness within naturalistic\nframework is available in Ganeri (2012, Part I). \n",
