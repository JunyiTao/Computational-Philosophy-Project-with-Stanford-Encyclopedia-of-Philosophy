    "main_text": "Religion || God\n6.1 God\n\nIbn Rushd believes that God\u2019s existence can be demonstrated\nthrough a complex argument from Aristotelian physics, establishing the\nexistence of a first cause (see \u00a75). As with physical arguments\nin general, the argument is a mere sign (dal\u012bl),\nstarting from empirical features of the world that are better known to\nus even if causally posterior (LongMeta 12.5 {1423}; see\n\u00a72) He rejects the a priori metaphysical arguments of\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (Davidson 1987 ch. 10; Bertolacci 2007) and of the\nAsh\u02bfarite theologians (Kashf 1), all of which he thinks\nnot only fall short of being demonstrative but also fail to be\npersuasive to ordinary people. For them, one should follow the example\nof the Qur\u02be\u0101n and deploy arguments from design\n(Kashf 1.33\u201338 {118\u201322}).\n\nIn keeping with Aristotle\u2019s remarks in Metaphysics\nXII.7, Ibn Rushd suggests that God serves not as an efficient cause,\nbut only as a final and formal cause. Efficient causality prevails\namong natural bodies, when one actually moving body brings another\nbody from potential to actual motion. The heavenly bodies, however,\nare already actual, and eternally so, and so in this domain efficient\ncausation has no place (PossibConj 14.86). The relationship\nof First Cause to the celestial spheres, then, is that of intelligible\nto intellect\u2014that is, the eternal thoughts of the First Cause\nare the forms that serve as final causes inspiring the celestial\nintelligences (LongMeta XII.36 {1592}; XII.44 {1652};\nLongCaelo IV.1.654; Incoherence I.14 {481};\nConjunction Epistle 1, par. 3-4). God, being wholly\nimmaterial, cannot directly act on the sublunary material realm at\nall, but plays a causal role only through the mediation of the\ncelestial spheres: \u201cthe temporal cannot proceed from an\nabsolutely eternal being, but only from an eternal being which is\neternal in its substance but temporal in its movements, namely, the\ncelestial body\u201d (Incoherence I.13 {467}).\n(Interpretation here is more contentious than this brief summary\nsuggests. For various approaches see Kogan 1985 ch. 5; Davidson 1992,\n227\u201330; Adamson 2019; Twetten forthcoming.)\n\nGod alone, among intellectual beings, has no further object of\nintellectual contemplation that might serve as his final cause. On the\ncontrary, \u201cthe First Form thinks of nothing outside\nitself\u201d (LongAnima III.5 {410}; EpiAnima 219\n{93}; EpiMeta 4.158 {147}; LongMeta XII.51 {1700}).\nThis helps account for God\u2019s unique simplicity as a pure mind,\nalways fully actualized by nothing other than God. It leads to\nquestions, however, about the sense in which God can be said to have\nknowledge of the created world. This is \u201cthe most powerful\ndoubt\u201d regarding this conception of God (EpiMeta 4.159\n{148}), and it threatens to lead to the view al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b had\nbranded as heretical: that God does not know particulars\n(Incoherence II.4 {587}). Ibn Rushd denies that he is\ncommitted to this consequence. God has knowledge of the created world\nin his own manner, neither in universal nor particular, not as if his\nthoughts are caused by the world, but rather as the cause of the world\n(Incoherence I.3 {226-7}, I.13 {462};\n\u1e0cam\u012bma 7; LongMeta XII.51\n{1707\u20138}). The divine mind\u2019s \u201cthinking its own self\nis identical with its thinking all existence\u201d\n(Incoherence I.11 {435}).\n\nFor terms to apply to God and creatures in a non-univocal way\n(bi-ishtir\u0101k) is a common state of affairs for Ibn Rushd\n(LongMeta XII.39 {1620\u20134}). It arises, for instance,\nnot just in the case of knowledge but also in the case of will. For,\nsince God \u201cis exempt from passivity and change,\u201d He does\nnot exercise will in the usual sense of the term (Incoherence\nI.3 {148}). Still, in another sense God is \u201can intending and\nwilling agent\u201d (Kashf 5.80 {163}) in virtue of the\nspecial causal relationship that God has to the world. Similarly, Ibn\nRushd affirms, in a special sense, that God is the creator of the\nworld (QPhys 3; Kashf 5.78\u201391\n{161\u2013173}), and that God exercises providence\n(\u02bfin\u0101ya) over all existent beings, though he denies\nthat any individual enjoys a special divine providence\n(LongMeta XII.37 {1607}, XII.52; EpiMeta\n4.176\u201381 {166\u201371}). It is difficult to assess the degree\nto which, on this account, either God\u2019s will or the world is\nnecessitated (Belo 2007; Hourani 1962; Taylor 2014).\n\nThe various strands of Ibn Rushd\u2019s conception of God are set out\non one hand against Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s insufficiently\nAristotelian philosophy, and on the other hand against Ash\u02bfarite\ntheology (kal\u0101m). His systematic examination of the\nAsh\u02bfarites in al-Kashf establishes at length that their methods\nare sophistical and delusional, drawing on two basic resources: the\nintention of Islamic law and Aristotle\u2019s philosophy (Arfa Mensia\n2019). But even where Ibn Rushd is examining the\nmutakallim\u016bn and offering rival interpretations of\nreligious texts, it is not his intention to set philosophy at the\nservice of any kind of theology. Instead these writings are more\nappropriately classified as philosophical considerations on religious\ntexts and theological issues.\n\nProphecy is a good example of how Ibn Rushd distinguishes himself both\nfrom the theologians and from previous philosophical approaches\n(Taylor 2018). The trustworthiness of prophecy is foundational to\nIslam: \u201cthe sending forth of prophets is based on the fact that\nrevelation comes down to them from heaven, and on this our religion is\nbased\u201d (Kashf 4.58 {142}). The Ash\u02bfarites had\nrelied primarily on miracles to establish the veracity of the Prophet\nMuhammed. Ibn Rushd evaluates this approach from his Aristotelian\nbackground. His first step is to situate the miraculous\n(mu\u02bfjiz) as a tool of persuasion belonging to the art of\nrhetoric, standing to the prophetic claim as an extrinsic argument\n(Ben Ahmed 2012). Analogously, when I swear that something is true,\nthe oath I advance has no intrinsic connection to what is claimed as\nbeing true. The Ash\u02bfarites conceive of the relation between being\nprophetic and a miracle as that of a quality to its act. The miracle\nmust be, in principle, an act that is generated from that quality,\njust as the act of healing the sick emanates from the quality of being\na physician (Kashf 5.95\u20136 {177}). Accordingly, the\nproof that I am a prophet is that I can produce an extra-ordinary act,\nsuch as walking on water, turning a stick into a snake, or splitting\nthe moon. Ibn Rushd responds by identifying a miracle as merely\n\u201can external sign\u201d of prophecy. The act that more closely\ndemonstrates prophecy is to establish a law that is useful for people.\nThus it is the Qur\u02be\u0101n that proves Muhammad\u2019s veracity:\n\u201cBecause of the universality of the teaching of the Precious\nBook and the universality of the laws contained in it\u2014by which I\nmean their liability to promote the happiness of all\nmankind\u2014this religion is common to all mankind\u201d\n(Kashf 5.103 {184}). A miracle alone, in contrast, is at best\ncomplementary, and an argument from miracles is merely persuasive or\nrhetorical. (See further Arfa Mensia 1999, Ben Ahmed 2012).\n",
