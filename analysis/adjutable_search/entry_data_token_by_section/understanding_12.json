    "main_text": "Humanistic Understanding || Perspective-taking and its Critics\n5.1 Perspective-taking and its Critics\n\nA central tenet of the humanistic tradition is that when an agent has\na first-person perspective on the world, there is value in trying to\n\u201ctake up\u201d or \u201cassume\u201d that perspective, rather\nthan simply trying to map that agent\u2019s perspective from a\ndetached, third-person perspective. Abraham Lincoln for instance,\ncould presumably be understood from a third-person, detached\nperspective by a psychologist adept at mapping the various ways in\nwhich Lincoln\u2019s beliefs and desires, hopes and fears, seemed to\ndepend upon and relate to one another. What the humanistic tradition\nsays is that even if the psychologist were to do this exquisitely, so\nthat all of these relationships were accurately plotted, there would\nstill be an important sort of understanding missing\u2014an\nunderstanding of what it was like to be Lincoln from the inside, or to\nregard the world as he regarded it, at least in part.\n\nPhilosophers differ about the epistemic value of this project of\nperspective-taking. Thus some claim that there are certain\nfacts that only show up from a first-person point of view\n(Nagel 1974), and hence can only be apprehended from that point of\nview. For instance, if I want to apprehend facts about \u201cwhat it\nis like\u201d to experience the world from your perspective, I\narguably need to try to place myself, somehow, in that perspective.\nOthers claim that certain concepts only show up for us from a\nfirst-personal, engaged perspective. For instance, perhaps the concept\nof chronic pain can only be acquired by someone who has experienced\nit, or the concept of romantic love, or racial bigotry. A related view\nis that while these concepts can perhaps be acquired without\nthe relevant first-person experience, they cannot be adequately\ngrasped or mastered without that experience. As Stephen Turner\nwrites:\n\nWhen a mother tells her 13 year old daughter that she does not know\nwhat \u201clove\u201d is, she is not making a comment about\nsemantics; she is pointing to the nonlinguistic experiential\nconditions that are bound up with the understanding of the term that\nthe daughter does not share. (Turner 2019: 254)\n\nThe thought here seems to be that while the daughter might have the\nconcept of love, her grasp of the concept will be extremely poor\nwithout the benefit of the first-person experience, and her attempts\nto apply it will be unreliable.\n\nIn fields such as anthropology, ethnography, and sociology, and in the\nphilosophical areas that reflect on these disciplines (primarily, the\nphilosophy of social science), questions related to the epistemic\nvalue of perspective-taking gave rise to debates about whether it is\nnecessary to immerse oneself in a society in order to understand it\nadequately. According to some, the answer is \u201cyes\u201d: if I\nwant to understand a society or culture, I need to understand it from\nthe participants\u2019 perspective, with special sensitivity to the\nconcepts and rules that guide the participants\u2019 perspective,\neven if only implicitly (see especially Winch 1958, 1964). It is then\nsometimes claimed that one can only really grasp or master these\nconcepts by participating in the relevant form of life. As the\nethnographer James Spradley writes:\n\n\nImmersion is the time-honored strategy used by most ethnographers. By\ncutting oneself off from other interests and concerns, by listening to\ninformants hours on end, by participating in the cultural scene, and\nby allowing one\u2019s mental life to be taken over by the new\nculture, themes [the implicit beliefs of a culture] often emerge\n\u2026 This type of immersion will often reveal new relationships\namong domains and bring to light cultural themes you cannot discover\nany other way. (Spradley 1980: 145; cf. Kampa 2019)\n\n\nAnother view is that immersion, while perhaps helpful, is not strictly\nnecessary. What is necessary is recognizing the priority of the\nparticipants\u2019 perspective, and using that perspective to\ncharacterize the activities that need to be understood in the first\nplace (Taylor 1971; McCarthy 1973). If we want to make sense of what\nlooks like (say) voting or praying in another culture, we need to\nadopt that culture\u2019s way of identifying what counts as voting or\npraying (which perhaps will turn out to be a distinct but closely\nrelated activity, such as voting* or praying*). Carving up the\nbehavior according to our own categories will only\nmisrepresent what is happening and lead to misunderstanding.\n\nPeter Winch, among others, further argues that it is hard or\nimpossible to try to adopt another culture\u2019s way of carving up\nthe world without somehow taking that culture on board in a holistic\nway, because it is hard or impossible to characterize particular bits\nof behavior in isolation (Winch 1958). To make sense of what a\nmedieval knight means by praying (or praying*), for example, I might\nneed to connect this with other concepts (perhaps such as honor, or\nduty, or salvation) that again might be quite different than my own.\nThe result might then be that one gradually acquires what Alasdair\nMacIntyre calls a \u201csecond first language\u201d, as one\u2019s\ngrasp of the relationships between different concepts and their\napplications increases (MacIntyre 1988: ch. 19).\n\nAgainst the push for perspective-taking as a source of understanding,\nespecially in the social sciences, at least three strains of criticism\narose: Positivist, Critical, and Gadamerian.\n\nThe Positivist critique\u2014associated with thinkers such as\nTheodore Abel (1948), Ernest Nagel (1953), and Richard Rudner\n(1966)\u2014had a number of prongs. For one thing, there were grave\ndoubts about the reliability of the processes associated with\nperspective taking. After all, it seems all too easy to project\none\u2019s own cares and concerns onto the minds of others. It was\nalso argued that reliving experiences, to the extent that this is\npossible, does not actually amount to an explanation of why the\nexperiences happened. I could, after all, have lived through a series\nof events myself, but not been able to explain or understand\nthem\u2014so why should imaginatively living through someone\nelse\u2019s experiences, to the extent this is possible,\nautomatically grant me understanding? (For an overview of these\nobjections, see Martin 2000; Fay 2016; Beiser 2019.)\n\nCritical Theorists have argued that the first-person perspective is\nnot the most theoretically or politically important perspective,\nbecause it often masks deeper and more significant sources of behavior\n(see Warnke 2019). The deeper sources might include an agent\u2019s\nown, unacknowledged motivations, or they might include the\npresuppositions, power dynamics, and economic conditions of the\nsociety that shaped the possibility spaces in which the agent moves.\nIt is thus what happens \u201cbehind the back\u201d of the subject\nthat is often crucial for truly understanding behavior\u2014the\nhidden impulses and power dynamics and systems of oppression that are\noften obscured from the perspective of the agent, sometimes in an\nunacknowledged way by the agent herself. (Here we also find\ninfluential Marxist and Feminist analyses and critiques. See Alcoff\n2005; Warnke 2014.)\u00a0A hybrid view, from Habermas, is that we need\nto be able to shift back and forth between the subject\u2019s\nperspective and the structural perspective, if we are to properly\nunderstand the reality of social life (Habermas 1981 [1984/1987]; for\nan overview, see Baynes 2016).\n\nThe Gadamerian critique, finally, is that we can never fully jump\noutside of our own cares and concerns in order to adopt the cares and\nconcerns of others. Reliving or re-experiencing\u2014 in the sense of\ntransposing ourselves out of our framework and into\nthe framework of other agents or cultures\u2014is thus an impossible\nideal. Instead, we always take our frameworks with us (Gadamer 1960\n[1989]). For Gadamer, what understanding others\u2014and especially\ntheir written or spoken words\u2014requires is not transposing\nourselves into their worldviews, but trying to fuse our worldviews in\nsome way (Horizontverschmelzung). Perhaps, for example, my\nconception of voting or prayer will become enlarged or modified by\nengaging with the conceptions I find in other cultures, and perhaps\nespecially through a dialogue with the texts of those cultures.\nWhether this fusion essentially amounts to a project of translation\n(from one worldview to another), or something else is a matter for\ndebate.
