    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || External Resources\n4.4 External Resources\n\nA number of authors have argued that practical reason has available to\nit the resources to accommodate incomparability in ways that would\nappear to address the concern raised by Regan.\n\nCharles Taylor outlines two such sets of resources. First, we are able\nto appeal to \u201cconstitutive goods that lie behind the life\ngoods\u201d our sense of which is \u201cfleshed out, and passed on,\nin a whole range of media: stories, legends, portraits of exemplary\nfigures and their actions and passions, as well as in artistic works,\nmusic, dance, ritual, modes of worship, and so on\u201d (1997, 179).\nSecond, we cannot escape the need to live an integrated life or to\nhave this, at a minimum, as an aspiration (1997, 180). Given that a\nlife is finite, leading a life involves an articulation of how\ndifferent goods fit into it relative to one another. More generally,\nour lives take on a certain \u201cshape\u201d and this shape\nprovides guidance in making choices in the face of incomparability\n(1997, 183). Michael Stocker similarly points out that alternatives\nare rarely considered in the abstract (1997). Instead, they are\nusually considered in concrete ways in which they are\nvaluable\u2014for example, as part of one\u2019s life. Once\nconsidered in such concrete contexts, there are considerations\naccording to which alternatives can be evaluated for purposes of\njustified choice. In his analysis of incommensurability, Fred\nD\u2019Agostino discusses the role of social institutions in\nresolving value conflicts (2003).\n\nAnother resource that has been invoked is morality. Recall Elizabeth\nAnderson\u2019s discussion of the example of the choice between\nsaving the life of one\u2019s mother and maintaining a close\nfriendship. Anderson regards the attempt to invoke a comparison of\nvalues as incoherent from the perspective of practical reason.\nInstead, ordinary moral thinking focuses on the obligations one has to\none\u2019s mother and one\u2019s friends. In turn, Anderson suggests\nthat the obligations themselves will provide guidance (1997, 106). The\navailability of such resources to reason is independent of her\ntheories of value and rationality. John Finnis also points to\nprinciples of morality as guiding reason which avoids comparability\nproblems (1997). It remains an open question as to how wide a range of\ncases it is in which morality can provide such guidance.\n\nOne worry that may arise in appealing to such external resources is\nthat they address the problem of incomparability by simply denying it.\nThe shape of one\u2019s life or the \u201cconstitutive goods that\nlie behind the life goods,\u201d for example, would appear to be\nsources of value. Insofar as they provide a value against which to\nresolve the initial value conflict, it might be said that there was no\nproblem of incomparability in the first place.\n\nTwo responses to this worry can be given. First, even if these\nexternal resources can ground comparisons, it does not follow that\nthey provide a systematic resolution to value conflicts. Insofar as\nthe shapes of people\u2019s lives differ, the way in which two\nindividuals resolve the same value conflict may be different. The fact\nthat it may be consistent with reason to resolve the same value\nconflict in different ways points to the possibility of\nincomparability.\n\nSecond, in the case of moral considerations, there may not be any\ndenial of incomparability. Moral considerations may provide guidance\nwithout comparing alternative courses of action (Finnis 1997,\n225\u2013226). Furthermore, some philosophers argue that the moral\nwrongness of certain actions is intelligible only in virtue of\nincomparability. For example, Alan Strudler argues that to deliberate\nabout the permissibility of lying in terms of comparable options is to\nmisunderstand the wrong in lying (1998, 1561\u20131564).\n",
