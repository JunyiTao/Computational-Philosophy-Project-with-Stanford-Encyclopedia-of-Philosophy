    "main_text": "Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis || The Negative Program in Experimental Moral Philosophy\n2.1 The Negative Program in Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nEarly work in experimental philosophy suggested cross-cultural\ndifferences in semantic, epistemic, and moral intuitions. For example,\nMachery, Mallon, Nichols, and Stich (2004) argued that East Asian\nsubjects were more likely to hold descriptivist intuitions than their\nWestern counterparts, who tended to embrace causal theories of\nreference. Haidt (2006) argued that the extent to which people judged\nharmless violations such as eating a deceased pet, or engaging in\nconsensual sibling incest, to be wrong depended on socioeconomic\nstatus. Since, presumably, moral wrongness doesn\u2019t itself depend\non socioeconomic status, gender, or culture of the person making the\nmoral judgment, these results have been marshaled to argue either\nagainst the evidential value of intuitions or against the existence of\nmoral facts altogether.\n\nNegative experimental moral philosophy generates results that are then\nused to discount the evidential value of appeals to intuition (for\nreview, Machery 2017, Chapter 2). For example, Singer (2005),\nSinnott-Armstrong (2008d), Lanteri and colleagues (2008), Lombrozo\n(2009), Schwitzgebel and Cushman (2012, 2015), Liao and colleagues\n(2012), Tobia and colleagues (2013), Wiegmann and colleagues (2020),\nRehren and Walter (2021), and McDonald et al. (2021) have\nargued that moral intuitions are subject to normatively\nirrelevant situational influences (e.g., order or framing effects),\nwhile Feltz and Cokely (2009) and Knobe (2011) have documented\ncorrelations between moral intuitions and (presumably) normatively\nirrelevant individual differences (e.g., extroversion). Such results\nmight warrant skepticism about moral intuitions, or at least about\nsome classes of intuitions or\n intuiters.[1]\n\nThe studies just mentioned involve results that suggest that the\ncontent of intuitions varies along some normatively irrelevant\ndimension. Another source of evidence for the negative program draws\non results regarding the cognitive mechanisms underlying or generating\nintuitions themselves. For example, studies that suggest that\ndeontological intuitions are driven by emotional aversions to harming\nothers have been used to argue that we ought to discount our\ndeontological intuitions in favor of consequentialist\nprinciples\u2014an idea discussed in more detail below (see Singer\n2005; Wiegman 2017). In several experiments, Kneer and\nMachery (2019) show that judgments about moral luck result from\nthe hindsight bias, i.e., the tendency to overestimate the probability\nthat events known to have happened would happen. Thus, the\nprobability that the unlucky event in a bad luck situation (e.g.,\na car accident involving a drunk driver) would happen is\noverestimated and the agent is judged to have been more\nnegligent than her counterpart in a lucky situation (the drunk\ndriver who did not get into any accident). This psychological account\nis then used to undermine the philosophical significance of intuitions\nabout moral luck: If the asymmetry between good and back luck\nsituations is due to a psychological bias, it should not bear on\nphilosophical theorizing.\n\nThe distinction between negative and positive experimental moral\nphilosophy is difficult to draw, partly because the negative program\noften discounts particular classes or types of intuitions in favor of\nothers that are supposed to be more reliable. For example, Singer\noffers an anti-deontological argument as part of the negative program\ninsofar as his argument uses the emotional origins of deontological\nintuitions to discount them. But because he then argues for the\nsuperiority of consequentialist intuitions, his position also fits\nwithin the positive program. So the difference between the two\nprograms is not in the data or the kinds of questions investigated,\nbut in how the data are put to use\u2014whether they are seen as\ndebunking traditional philosophical appeals to intuition or as an\naddition to traditional philosophical appeals to intuition, by helping\nphilosophers distinguish between reliable and unreliable intuitions\nand their sources. In the next section, we look at positive uses of\nintuitions as evidence.\n",
