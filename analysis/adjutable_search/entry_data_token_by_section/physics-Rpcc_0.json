    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Common Cause Principle (RCCP) was introduced by Hans\nReichenbach, in The Direction of Time, which was published\nposthumously in 1956. The principle posits a connection between causal\nstructure and probabilistic correlations between events. After\npresenting the principle in\n Section 2,\n we will provide some historical background in\n Section 3.\n The following two sections present some illustrations and alleged\ncounterexamples to RCCP.\n Section 6\n discusses Reichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry, a (putative)\ntemporal asymmetry in macrostatistical patterns that he associated\nwith RCCP.\n Section 7\n presents the Causal Markov Condition, which plays a central\nrole in causal modeling methods. The Causal Markov Condition is often\nseen as a modern successor of RCCP, and its relationship to RCCP will\nbe examined.\n Section 8\n will develop RCCP in a formal setting that is suitable for examining\nthe status of RCCP in quantum mechanics.\n Section 9\n and\n Section 10\n will then consider whether RCCP is compatible with quantum\nphysics.\n",
