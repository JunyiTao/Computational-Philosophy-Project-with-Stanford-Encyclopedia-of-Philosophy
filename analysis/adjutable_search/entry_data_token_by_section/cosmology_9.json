    "main_text": "Underdetermination || Establishing FLRW Geometry?\n2.3 Establishing FLRW Geometry?\n\nThe case of global spacetime geometry is not a typical instance of\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, as discussed by\nphilosophers, for two reasons (see Manchak 2009, Norton 2011,\nButterfield 2014). First, this whole discussion assumes that classical\nGR holds; the question regards discriminating among models of a given\ntheory, rather than a choice among competing theories. Second, these\nresults establish that all observations available to us that are\ncompatible with a given spacetime, with some appealing global\nproperty, are equally compatible with its indistinguishable\ncounterparts. But as is familiar from more prosaic examples of the\nproblem of induction, evidence of past events is compatible, in a\nsimilar sense, with many possible futures. Standard accounts of\ninductive inference aim to justify some expectations about the future\nas more reasonable, e.g., those based on extending past uniformities.\nThe challenge in this case is to articulate an account of inductive\ninferences that justifies accepting one spacetime over its\nindistinguishable counterparts.\n\nAs a specific instance of this challenge, consider the status of the\ncosmological principle, the global symmetry assumed in the derivation\nof the FLRW models. The results above show that all evidence available\nto us is equally compatible with models in which the cosmological\nprinciple does or does not hold. One might take the principle as\nholding a priori, or as a pre-condition for cosmological\ntheorizing (Beisbart 2009). A recent line of work aims to justify the\nFLRW models by appealing to a weaker general principle in conjunction\nwith theorems relating homogeneity and isotropy. Global isotropy\naround every point implies global homogeneity, and it is natural to\nseek a similar theorem with a weaker antecedent formulated in terms of\nobservable quantities. The Ehlers-Geren-Sachs theorem (Ehlers et al.\n1968) shows that if all geodesic fundamental observers in an expanding\nmodel find that freely propagating background radiation is exactly\nisotropic, then their spacetime is an FLRW model. If our causal past\nis \u201ctypical\u201d, observations along our worldline will\nconstrain what other observers should see. This is often called the\nCopernican principle\u2014namely, no point \\(p\\) is distinguished\nfrom other points \\(q\\) by any spacetime symmetries or lack thereof\n(there are no \u201cspecial locations\u201d). There are indirect\nways of testing this principle empirically: the\nSunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich effect can be used to indirectly measure the\nisotropy of the CBR as observed from distant points. Other tests are\ndirect tests with a good enough set of standard candles, and an\nindirect test based on the time drift of cosmological redshift. This\nline of work provides an empirical argument that the observed universe\nis well-approximated by an FLRW model, thus changing that assumption\nfrom a philosophically based starting point to an observationally\ntested foundation.\n",
