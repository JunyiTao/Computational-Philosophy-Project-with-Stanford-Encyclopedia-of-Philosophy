At the time of Mah\u0101v\u012bra around the\nfifth\u2013sixth centuries BCE, a practice was observed in the\nnumerous movements of wandering mendicants: instead of answering\nphilosophical questions in a one-sided way, the teacher was analyzing\n(vibhajya) them, showing their different presuppositions and\npossible meanings. Probably inherited from exegetical practices of\ninterpretation of sacred texts, which dominantly consisted in\nanalyzing the many perspectives that one could have on a single\nsentence. In Jainism, one of the most famous examples of this practice\nis to be found in the Venerable Exposition of teaching\n(Bhagavat\u012bs\u016btra, or\nVy\u0101khy\u0101praj\u00f1aptis\u016btra [Viy.]; old parts\n5th\u20132th centuries BCE, new 2nd\ncentury BCE to 1st century CE), in which the disciple\nIndrabh\u016bti Gautama asks to the monk Jam\u0101li:\n\n\n\nIs the \u201cloka\u201d (here meaning both\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cself\u201d) eternal or is it,\nJam\u0101li, non-eternal?\n\n\nBeing asked in this manner, Jam\u0101li was doubtful and wanted to\nknow, but was overwhelmed with confusion. He was unable to speak in\nreply and remained silent. When Jam\u0101li was confused,\nBhagav\u0101n Mah\u0101v\u012bra addressed him as follows:\n\n\nThe world is, Jam\u0101li, eternal [\u2026] it was, it is and it\nwill be [\u2026].\n\nThe world is, Jam\u0101li, non-eternal. For it becomes progressive\nafter being regressive. And it becomes regressive after being\nprogressive.\n\nThe soul is, Jam\u0101li, eternal. For it did not cease to exist at\nany time.\n\nThe soul is, Jam\u0101li, non-eternal. For it becomes animal after\nbeing a hellish creature, becomes a man after becoming an animal and\nit becomes a god after being a man.\n\n\n\nSo in this example, the Jaina teacher insists on the fact that:\n\nwith respect to its substance, the self is eternal, like atoms\nare.\nbut with respect to its modes, the self is non-eternal, like\ncombinations of atoms.\n\n\nHere, Mah\u0101v\u012bra does not make contradictory predications, but\nhe refutes extremes views, which are considered as wrong, by making\nexplicit the parameters of the different predications. It is\ninteresting to notice that at the same period, the Buddha, who also\nuses distinctions of the sort in his speech, is known to refuse to\nanswer questions of the sort (Matilal 1981).\n3.4.2 From the paradoxes of causation to accounting for change and persistence\n\nNow, this way of making distinctions in predication should be thought\nof in close connection with considerations about causation. Indeed,\nthe Jaina teacher also insists on the fact that one can give a proper\naccount of a causal process only when one acknowledges both\npersistence and change.\n\nTo explain, it is not so obvious that we are legitimate in considering\nourselves as being the same individual in time, since after all, the\ncells in our body are continuously replaced, none of the cells that\ncurrently constitute me will exist in seven years, each will have been\nrenewed. Conversely, how are we to account for change? Any mechanical\nexplanation of it fails, like Zeno\u2019s arrow that has to travel\nhalf the way before it meets its target, but before it meets the half,\nit has to travel half the half, and before that, half of the half of\nthe half, and so, ad infinitum, without being able to even\nstart the movement. There is a problem with our way of accounting for\nchange. Noticing this state of affair, South Asian philosophers\nengaged in raging debates around the paradoxes of causality at the\nturn of the CE. In a nutshell, if someone says \u201cthe potter makes\nthe pot\u201d, there are several types of possible stance on\nthis:\n\none can say that the effect \u201cpot\u201d already exists prior\nto the fruition of its immediate cause;\none can say that it does not, hence the relevance of the causation\nprocess;\nsome that it is neither existent, nor non-existent before the\ncausation process;\nand one can also say that it both exists and does not exist prior\nto that.\n\n\nWhile philosophers from different lineages have been variously\ndepicted as holding one or the other of these alternatives, Jainas are\nconsistently depicted as holding the last one and it is regularly\nconsidered as a Jaina specificity to hold that something both exists\nand does not exist prior to the causation process. But of course,\nJains are far from being the only ones to claim so. Besides, they\nclaim more precisely that what exists is at once originating, decaying\nand persisting in an essential and simultaneous way:\n\n\nTS 5.29. Existence is endowed with production, decay and\nduration.\n\n\n\nIndeed, any existing entity is both made of permanent atoms, sometimes\nincluding a permanent self; and partaking to the manifold and changing\nworld we experience (Soni 1991). Here, while it is produced:\n\nthe pot is already existent with respect to its substance\n(dravya), the clay;\nyet formerly non-existent with respect to its particular modes\n(pary\u0101ya; gu\u1e47a): shape, function,\netc.\n\n\nJaina philosophers insist on the fact that none of these aspects is\nmore important than the other one. This means that substance and mode\nco-exist not in, but as a single discrete entity in\nJainism. This single discrete entity is called a many-sided object of\nknowledge (prameya, vastu). This is the famous\ndoctrine of the many-sidedness of things\n(anek\u0101ntav\u0101da). It notably goes against the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika conception, according to which qualities, like\n\u201cbeing ochre\u201d, exist independently of substances like\n\u201cpots\u201d, and are linked with them thanks to a relation of\ninherence. It also goes against the Buddhist conception, according to\nwhich only what is a non-complex unity is real (Gorisse 2022b). By the\nway, Jainas are realist philosophers who consider that human beings\nknow a world that exists in its particularity independently of their\nknowledge of it, in such a way that the fact that our assertions can\nbe specified following many perspectives can only come from the fact\nthat the known object itself has many aspects.\n3.4.3 Existence, non-existence, and the modes of predication\n\nNow, this conception led Jaina thinkers to claim that what surrounds\nus is at the same time existent and non-existent. Because, this\ncomplex object is existent as permanent with respect to its substance,\nyet non-existent as permanent with respect to its states. The Jaina\nauthor who spends the most time on elucidating in which sense\nexistence and non-existence can be predicated to an object is probably\nHaribhadras\u016bri in his Victory banner of the theory of\nnon-one-sidedness (Anek\u0101ntajayapat\u0101k\u0101\n[AJP]) (Mundra 2022; Van Den Bossche 1995). Now, Jainas are known to\ngo further and to introduce not two, but seven modes of predication.\nHaribhadra is deeply influenced by the Investigation on\nAuthority (\u0100ptam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\n[\u0100m\u012b]) of Samantabhadra, which is amongst the first to teach\nthat:\n\n\n\u0100m\u012b 14. An entity is somehow possessed of the character\n\u201cbeing\u201d, somehow possessed of the character\n\u201cnon-being\u201d, somehow possessed of both, and somehow\nindescribable\u2014all these four features characterizing it in\naccordance with the speaker\u2019s intention and not in an absolute\nfashion.\n\u0100m\u012b 15. Certainly, who will not allow that an entity is\npossessed of the character \u201cbeing\u201d so far as its own form\netc. are concerned; while it is possessed of the character\n\u201cnon-being\u201d so far as opposite is the case? For if that be\nnot so, this entity will not be viewed as having a fixed nature of its\nown.\n\n\n\nThis means that existence is a property of something, inasmuch as this\nthing exists in relation to the substance, locus, time and state that\nare its own. In this dynamic, existence is identity with oneself.\nWhile non-existence is difference, and accounts for change. We need to\nrecognize the non-existence of the thing in relation with forms, etc.\nwhich are alien to it. As such, the not-being blue is part of the\nessence of the red pot. Only thanks to this can the thing have that\nparticular essence, because something is what it is as opposed\nto what it is not. This is close to the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 doctrine of identity in difference\n(bhed\u0101bheda) (Uno 1997). Now, when we act in our every\nday life, our decisions involve objects more complex than that, i.e.,\nobjects which are existent with respect to some parameters and\nnon-existent with respect to other parameters. Besides, also\ninexpressibility is somehow a property of the thing, in the sense that\nsometimes, existence and non-existence are considered simultaneously,\nand that this is impossible to express. In my everyday life, I act\nbeing surrounded by things which are all this, this is why existence,\nnon-existence and inexpressible combine into not two, but seven modes\nof predication, namely, I can say that something exist; does not\nexist; exist and does not exists; is inexpressible; exist and is\ninexpressible; does not exist and is inexpressible; or exist, does not\nexist and is inexpressible.\n3.4.4 The doctrine of perspectives\n\nTrying to make sense of the fact that a substance is at the same time\npersistent and subject to modification within a single coherent\nmetaphysical system is the old problem of the articulation of the one\nand the many. The solution that Jaina philosophers brought to this\nissue with all these doctrines linked with many-sidedness, is probably\ntheir major contribution to philosophy (Radhakrishnan 1923;\nPadmarajiah 1963; Shah 2000; Barbato 2018). The last doctrine which\nwill retain our attention here is the doctrine of perspectives\n(nayav\u0101da). From Siddhasena Mah\u0101mati,\nAkala\u1e45ka, and their respective lineage of commentaries, see\nespecially Siddhar\u1e63iga\u1e47i\u2019s Commentary to the\nGuide of Logic (Ny\u0101y\u00e2vat\u0101raviv\u1e5btti\n[NAv], 900 CE) and Prabh\u0101candra\u2019s Sun [that opens] the\nlotus of the knowable\n(Prameyak\u0101malam\u0101rta\u1e47\u1e0da [PKM],\n980\u20131065 CE), the doctrine of perspective is a technical\napparatus that deals with our ways to know something, like a\nmeta-epistemology. It provides an exhaustive classification of the\nmain epistemic perspectives through which one can consider the\nessentially complex knowable from the most inclusive to the most\nparticular perspective. Indeed, human epistemic faculties are such\nthat they subsume diversity under unity, otherwise nothing would be\nintelligible nor communicable, and that from this, the fundamental\ncomplexity of the object of knowledge is resolved. Now, there are\ndifferent ways to subsume diversity under unity or, to say it\ndifferently, different types of epistemic attention and different\ncontexts of assertion. And the doctrine of perspective enables to\nspecify the main favored types of attention that are active during the\nperformance of a knowledge statement.\n\nBuilding on this, Jaina philosophers came to explain the resisting\ndivergences between the different philosophical systems as resulting\nfrom an initial choice of an epistemic perspective. In this dynamic,\nthey classify the historical philosophical systems with which they\ninteract as developed not within a perspective, but within the\nerroneous radicalization of a perspective, because each tradition\ndepicted focuses on a given aspect of the knowable, since each also\nrefutes other unaddressed aspects. This will get clearer if we\nintroduce each perspective:\n\nThe first type of perspective, called the\n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d (naigama), is close to the Jaina\nposition. It is the attitude of the knowing subjects who focus on both\nunity and difference, but not at the same time. The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika thinkers are representatives of its\nerroneous developments, because they consider that what exists, the\nreality robust to philosophical investigations, is either a substance\nor a property. They excel in identifying the fundamental differences\nbetween the types of objects of knowledge, but they fail to understand\nthat it is the very same object that is grasped under it substantial\nor its modal aspect.\nThe second type of perspective, called the\n\u201csynthesizing\u201d (sa\u1e43graha) is the attitude\nof the knowing subjects who focus on unity, either unity of all things\nthat exist, or unity of all things which are a given type of\nsubstance. For Jaina philosophers, Advaita-ved\u0101nta and\nS\u0101\u1e43khya thinkers are representatives of its erroneous\ndevelopments, as they consider that the only robust reality is a\nsingle permanent reality that includes everything. Hence, they excel\nin identifying the imperceptible connections and the homogeneity\nunderlying the diversity of objects of knowledge, but they fail to\nalso understand the fundamental differences between them.\nIn contrast to this epistemic attitude, the third type of\nperspective, called the \u201cempirical\u201d, on worldly\ntransactions (vyavah\u0101ra), is that of the knowing\nsubjects who focus on difference. C\u0101rv\u0101ka thinkers are\nrepresentatives of its erroneous developments, because they consider\nthat the robust reality is the one that human beings encounter every\nday and that is useful to them. As such, they excel at identifying\nmodes and epistemic constructs active in the formulation of theses\nthat rely on more than just sense faculties, but they fail to see that\nalso metaphysical theses are relevant and that what we call\n\u201csubstance\u201d, like selves, exists and are not entirely\nsimilar with the modes that we encounter in every day life.\nBesides, the fourth type of perspective, the \u201cactual\u201d,\non what is directly present to the senses\n(\u1e5bjus\u016btra) is the stance of the knowing subjects\nwho focus on what is present in front of us at the moment, that is to\nsay on difference that is currently manifested. Buddhist thinkers are\nrepresentatives of its erroneous developments, because they consider\nthat only what is grasped in experience exists, nothing beyond, and\nthat the only robust reality is an extremely transient and particular\nreality. They therefore excel in identifying the epistemic\nconstructions active when operations of synthesis are performed on\nobjects of knowledge, but they fail to understand also the elements of\nfundamental permanence that exist in them.\nThe three last perspectives are those of the knowing subjects who\nfocus on the word. Grammarians are representatives of their erroneous\ndevelopments, because they consider that the robust reality is the\nlinguistic element that expresses the world. They excel at identifying\nthe semantic distinctions relevant to denote a given referent. But\nwhile they do so, they fail to also understand that only a plurality\nof frames of reference could enable to cover the integrality of\nreferential situations that one might experience. The fifth type of\nperspective, the \u201csemantic\u201d (\u015babda), deals\nmore precisely with grammatical rules. It is the perspective of the\nknowing subjects who focus on the word as expressing difference based\non grammatical categories.\nWhile the sixth, \u201cetymological\u201d\n(samabhir\u016b\u1e0dha) is concerned with difference based\non etymology.\nAnd the seventh, the \u201cactual etymological\u201d\n(eva\u1e43bh\u016bta), with difference based on etymology\nthat is currently manifested.\n\n\nIn his Establishment of all objects\n(Sarv\u0101rthasiddhi [SAS]), P\u016bjyap\u0101da\n(540\u2013600 CE) explains that like a piece of cloth fulfils a\npurpose only if its different threads are woven; in the same way, the\ndifferent perspectives fulfil a purpose only if they work together,\nand that isolated, they do not convey even a little faith. The\ndoctrine of perspectives seems to be the Jaina reaction to\nphilosophical and religious pluralism in classical India. To explain,\nthere exist resisting divergences concerning the nature of the\nultimate constituent of the world, the ways in which they interact,\ntheir origin; the position of human beings in all this and the\nconception of the way in which we should act. No strictly regulated\nphilosophical debate has been able to overcome these differences.\nJaina thinkers are likewise not trying to flatten these irreducible\nviews within a single conception. Rather, they show how each could\ncontribute to the whole picture.\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, philosophy within Jainism is mainly the means to come to\nknow the categories that are the selves and karmic matter, which are\nespecially relevant for our liberation. Many tools help us within this\neffort:\n\nthe Scriptures\u2014the teaching of beings experiencing absolute\nknowledge\u2014which, in turn, can be fully understood only by beings\nwith a similar mind. Here, the more advanced on the path, the more\nsenior the member of the monastic community, the better her\nunderstanding. This explains the huge number of hermeneutics\ntechniques come from this faith in the Scriptures, which are\nconsidered by some Jains as scientific treatises.\nour faculties of knowledge like perception, inference and the art\nof debate, up to a range of super-natural faculties of knowledge. Here\ntoo, a knowledge claim is to be analyzed through different types of\nperspectives.\nan openness to this higher order of being within ourselves,\nnotably through meditation.\n",
