    "main_text": "Memory and Justification || Preservationism and Generativism\n2.4 Preservationism and Generativism\n\nReliabilism and epistemic conservatism differ considerably. Still,\nthere is common ground, and not just because both are historical\ntheories. They agree that the past matters for present justification\nin a specific way; they each imply a thesis sometimes called\n\u201cpreservationism\u201d. More than one thesis in the\nepistemology of memory bears this name, however (Frise\u00a02015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n It is important to see how they are distinct.\n\nOne thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d has to do with how\nmemory is not or does not function like a traditional foundational\nsource of justification, such as perception. The thesis, roughly, is\nthat memory can at best preserve justification from other sources of\njustification, but memory cannot generate justification. At its core\nthis thesis is about a limit to memory\u2019s justificatory power.\nMemory does not generate justification. It might preserve\njustification, but perhaps it fails at even that. Strictly speaking,\nthis preservationism itself has no implications about whether the past\ndirectly matters for justification in the present. In other words, the\nthesis need not be historical, though it usually is bundled together\nwith historical views.\n\nA distinct thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d has to do with\nmemory\u2019s justificatory power, not a limit to its power. It\nstates, roughly, that a belief entering memory with justification\nkeeps it. Memory sustains justification when sustaining a belief that\nhad justification. This thesis itself says nothing about whether\nmemory can or cannot generate justification. When stated carefully\nthis preservationism is typically an historical theory of\njustification. Memory delivers justification in the present to a\nbelief that it keeps and that had justification in the past. Like the\nother thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d, this thesis is also\noften bundled together with other views, and sometimes the two\npreservationisms are endorsed at once, which can obscure that they are\nseparable.\n\nThe second preservationism is the common ground between reliabilism\nand epistemic conservatism, at least if memory is relevantly reliable\n(Frise 2017b). Suppose a reliable memory process receives as an input\nonly a justified belief that p, and yields belief that\np as an output. Reliabilism implies that the output belief is\njustified. Memory is delivering justification to a belief it held onto\nand that had justification. And epistemic conservatism says even mere\nbelieving provides justification for retaining belief. Justified\nbelieving must be able to do as much.\n2.4.1 Preservationism as Anti-generativism\n\nBecause these preservationist theses are distinct they merit separate\ndiscussion. The lion\u2019s share of the literature on\npreservationism is on the first thesis: memory can at best preserve\njustification, but cannot generate it. Preservationism of this stripe\nis popular (Annis 1980; Goldman 2009, 2011; Jackson 2011; Naylor 2015;\nOwens 2000; Senor 2007, 2010). While there are arguments for this\nview, it sometimes is treated as though it has a default status. It\nhas borne the crown since it was born. Arguments for it are\nunnecessary. Opposing views, rather, are what require arguments.\nPerhaps preservationism has attained this status because it seems\nintuitive or simply common sense to many. And it is not hard to see\nwhy it seems like common sense, given our common sense understanding\nof how memory works: memory accumulates and keeps information from\nother sources. It\u2019s not adding information. It\u2019s only\nnatural that memory would at best accumulate and keep justification\nfrom these sources. It\u2019s not adding justification.\n\nThe main view that denies this preservationism says, roughly, that\nmemory can generate justification. Aptly enough, this view is called\n\u201cgenerativism\u201d (or \u201cgenerationism\u201d; Michaelian\n2011b). If memory can generate justification, one plausible way it\nmight do so is by way of remembering or seeming to recollect. As\nnoted, some responses to the problems of forgotten evidence and stored\nbeliefs are that seeming recollection, or perhaps also a disposition\nto recollect, can justify. If a subject\u2019s seeming to recollect\nthat p results in her having justification for believing\np that she did not previously have, memory appears to be\ngenerating this justification. Unsurprisingly, generativism is popular\namong those who think seeming recollection justifies. Because\npreservationism and generativism deny each other, and generativism is\nthe positive thesis and preservationism the negative, preservationism\nis sometimes called \u201canti-generativism\u201d (Frise 2015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nIn favor of preservationism over generativism, Senor (2010) says\nmemory\u2019s job is preservative, both with respect to\nbelief and the justificatory status of belief. Naylor (2015) and Senor\n(2017) think preservationism helps explain what happens with stored\nbeliefs, in a way that might help solve the problem of stored beliefs.\nPresumably, the justification of stored beliefs does not increase\nsimply by the beliefs being stored in memory. And this is what\npreservationism predicts. Preservationism also seems to help with the\nproblem of forgotten defeat. In a case of forgotten defeat, a subject\nforgets a defeater for the justification of a belief. Goldman (2009)\nand Jackson (2011) find it plausible that memory will not increase the\njustification of that belief. And preservationism seems to predict\njust this too. Senor (2017) adds that, even if memory can generate\njustification, this is rare. More often, memory inherits justification\nfrom other sources.\n\nNuanced versions of and arguments for generativism abound. In favor of\ngenerativism over preservationism, Owens (1996) and Lackey (2005,\n2007) cite cases of recalled but previously unattended to information.\nA subject may witness an event, and store in memory certain details\nabout it that she does not notice until later. Only well after the\nevent does she remember the details and form a belief about them. The\nbelief seems justified, and memory is generating this justification.\nMichaelian (2011b) notes that in this sort of case, however, memory\nhad stored information and then generated new justified belief in it.\nBut the information was not new. Bernecker (2010) notes that\nthe justification from memory in this sort of case is merely doxastic,\nnot propositional (it is the justification of an attitude, not\njustification for having the attitude). The propositional\njustification for the believing the remembered details originated from\nperception at the time of witnessing the event, not from memory.\n\nMichaelian (2011b) argues that memory can do more. It can generate new\ncontent and, on reliabilism, new justification for belief in it,\nbecause memory is reliable. (Similarly, Huemer 1999 argues that\nseeming to remember can generate new justification for belief in new\ncontent.) Fern\u00e1ndez argues (2016) that memory can generate new\njustification for belief in specific new content. He argues\nthat an episodic memory contains information about how the memory\nitself originates from earlier perception of the way the world was.\nThis information about the memory\u2019s origin is new\u2014it was\nnot part of content of the earlier perception of the world. Memory\ngenerates this new content and, because memory is reliable, it can\ngenerate justification for believing the new content.\n\nLackey (2005) and Bernecker (2010) identify another sort of case in\nfavor of generativism. A subject may have a misleading defeater for\nthe justification for her belief that p. The defeater can\nthen be lost (perhaps due to forgetting). Thanks to memory the subject\nstill has the original justification for believing that p. So\nit looks like the subject\u2019s belief that p, thanks to\nmemory, is now justified. Senor (2007) points out that the\njustification in this sort of case is overall, but not prima facie.\nMemory is not generating new support, but is instead preserving\npreviously defeated support that then ceases to be defeated.\n\nBernecker and Grundmann (2019), in support of generativism, cite cases\nof incomplete remembering. Here, memory pares down the content of a\nbelief that may not have been acquired well. Incomplete remembering\ncan make up for the initial poor belief formation, perhaps by\nsimplifying the believed information and thus making it more likely\ntrue. The original belief may not have been reliably formed. But\nincomplete remembering reliably forms a new belief, and so the belief\nis justified. This justification originates from memory.\n\nFrise (2021) argues an extreme form of generativism follows from\nreliabilism. The extreme form says memory can generate justification\neven for an otherwise unjustified belief. On reliabilism, memory does\nthis by overdetermining belief. Memory might preserve a\nsubject\u2019s belief that p that had been formed without\njustification. Independently of her already believing that p,\nthe subject might now reconstructively recollect that p. For\nthat reason also she believes that p. This recollection is\nreliable. On reliabilism, the belief is now justified. But if\nthat\u2019s right, then reliabilism is less historical of a theory\nthan it had seemed. Memory does not always preserve a belief\u2019s\npast justificatory status. If the case of overdetermined belief counts\nas a case of forgotten defeat, then even reliabilism allows for\njustification in cases of forgotten defeat.\n\nGenerativism and preservationism may be able to broker an uneasy\ntruce. Perhaps certain types of memory (such as episodic memory) can\ngenerate justification but others (such as semantic memory) only\npreserve it (Teroni 2014). Perhaps memory can generate justification\nfor new beliefs but not for unjustified beliefs it simply stores\n(Huemer 1999; Senor 2017). Or perhaps memory can generate\njustification, but not knowledge (Audi 2002).\n2.4.2 Preservationism as an Historical Theory\n\nThe other thesis called \u201cpreservationism\u201d says, again,\nthat a belief in memory keeps its justification over time. If a\nsubject believes that p with justification at one time, and\nher belief that p stays in memory later, then her belief that\np is prima facie justified at the later time. There is less\ndiscussion of this preservationist thesis than the other. But it is at\nleast as popular as the other. Its proponents are numerous (Annis\n1980; Bernecker 2008; Burge 1997; Goldman 2009, 2011; Harman 1986;\nHuemer 1999; McGrath 2007; Naylor 2012; Owens 1999; Pappas 1980; Senor\n2010). A knowledge version of this preservationism thesis is also\npopular (Locke 1971; Malcolm 1963; Martin 2001; Shoemaker 1967).\n\nPreservationism is attractive in part because it may help with a kind\nof skepticism (Shoemaker 1967). We find ourselves with many beliefs,\nand many of them seem justified. What accounts for their\njustification? Our present support for those beliefs may not fully\nexplain their justification. But if beliefs inherit justification from\nthe past, that might explain the justification of many in the present.\nSimilarly, preservationism seems to help with the problems of\nforgotten evidence and stored beliefs (Goldman 2009, 2011). Even if a\nsubject forgets the original justifying evidence for her belief,\nmemory hangs on to the past justifiedness of the belief in the\npresent. If a subject has a belief stored in memory that had been\njustified, memory hangs on to its justification, even if nothing in\nthe subject\u2019s current mental life justifies the belief.\nPreservationism also fits with a natural understanding of\nmemory\u2019s main function, namely, that it is preservative. Memory\nstores information and attitudes toward information. It\u2019s\nplausible that memory also stores the justificatory status of these\nattitudes.\n\nNote that this version of preservationism is compatible with\ngenerativism; this helps illustrate how the two versions of\npreservationism are distinct. On this version of preservationism,\nmemory keeps justification in certain cases. But this version says\nnothing about the limits to memory\u2019s justificatory\npower. It could be that memory also generates justification in some\nother cases, as generativism says it can. This version of\npreservationism is incompatible, however, with time-slice theories of\njustification. Preservationism here allows a subject to have\njustification at one time because she had it at another time. The way\nthe subject or world is now does not fully explain why the\nsubject has justification now. Rather, the way the subject or world\nwas directly affects her justification now. But on a\ntime-slice theory of justification, nothing outside a time directly\nmatters for justification at that time.\n\nWhile this preservationism is a standard view, problems for it have\nbubbled to the surface. Three problems concern preservationism\u2019s\nconsequences for the degree of justification that memory\nallegedly preserves. Justification may not simply be binary (fully\npresent or absent), but instead come in a range of greater and lesser\nstrengths. If preservationism has implications about the degree to\nwhich memory preserves justification, the most natural view is that\nthe degree of justification stays the same. But according to Huemer\n(1999: 354) \u201cThe passage of time introduces new possibilities of\nerror; therefore, it lowers one\u2019s justification for believing a\nproposition\u201d. The idea is that as time goes on memory could be\nerring, and so this possibility diminishes justification over time.\nYet preservationism seems to say the degree of justification stays\nfixed.\n\nIt is not entirely clear which possible errors this problem centers\non, nor whether the mere passage of time matters. Suppose just a\nmoment has passed\u2014must justification decrease? Perhaps only\nlonger intervals of time matter. But suppose two subjects start out\nthe same mentally, and end up the same again mentally, but only after\nnotably unequal amounts of time (e.g., it takes one subject a year to\nend up mentally as the other subject is after just an hour). Perhaps\nnot even a longer interval itself results in less justification.\n\nHere is a second problem for preservationism that has to do with\ndegrees of justification (Frise 2017b). Suppose a subject formed a\njustified belief that p in the past and still believes that\np, and has no relevant defeaters. The subject now wonders\nwhether p is true, but does not recall. Does this failure to\nrecall lower the subject\u2019s justification for believing\np? If so, it is hard to explain this lowering of\njustification in a way that is friendly to preservationism; rival\ntheories offer simpler explanations. If not, preservationism has\nstrange results. In a case of retrieval failure it allows a\nsubject\u2019s belief that p to be as justified as it would\nbe if she had successfully recalled that p. But had the\nsubject only dimly recalled that p, presumably her\njustification would be lower than if she had successfully recalled\nthat p. It then follows that dimly recalling is worse than\ntrying and not recalling at all. Dim recollection results in less\njustification than failed recollection does, on preservationism.\n\nA final problem concerning preservationism and degrees of\njustification has to do with forgetting (BonJour 2016; Kelly 2016). A\nsubject might forget evidence that had justified her belief that\np to a very high degree. It\u2019s plausible that forgetting\nthis evidence should at least somewhat affect the degree of\njustification she has for p. But preservationism runs afoul\nof this if it implies that the high degree of justification remains.\nThe level of justification might decay over time in cases of forgotten\nevidence. Still, perhaps it never fully decays. If it does not, a\nversion of preservationism without implications about degrees of\njustification still stands (Goldman 2016).\n\nBut this version of preservationism still has other troubles. For one,\nit is at best an incomplete account of our justification from memory\n(Salvaggio 2018). Memory appears to be reconstructive, generating new\ncontent. And we often believe this new content. If any belief from\nmemory in new content is justified, preservationism doesn\u2019t say\nhow. It only explains how a preexisting belief can be justified.\nAnother trouble is this. Preservationism allows that a belief that\np can be justified now for a subject who has forgotten her\noriginal justifying evidence for p, and who has no other\nsupport for p. But suppose the subject learns something that\ndiscredits her original but forgotten evidence (Frise 2017b). Is her\nbelief that p still justified? If so, then preservationism\nallows an odd grandfathering of past justification; recently\ndefeated evidence can\u2019t justify now, but old justification from\nrecently defeated evidence remains. But if her belief that p\nis no longer justified, then preserved justification can disappear\nfrom seemingly arbitrary learning. A subject can lose justification\nfor her belief that p by learning something unimportant to\np or to her evidence for p.\n3. Justification and Beyond\n\nThis section continues to explore memory\u2019s relationship to\njustification and other epistemic goods. It does so by touching on\nmemory\u2019s relationship to testimony, the extended mind,\nmetacognition, knowledge-how, forgetting, and skepticism.\n3.1 Testimony and Memory\n\nMemory may have a special connection to testimony (see entry on\n epistemological problems of testimony).\n There is debate about whether the two have similar epistemic\nfunctions (Burge 1993; Lackey 2005; Malmgren 2006). Supposing they do,\nit is a further question what those functions are. Perhaps neither\ngenerates knowledge or certain other epistemic goods (Audi 1997). It\ncould be that a speaker\u2019s testimony can pass on knowledge to a\nhearer, but cannot create knowledge for the hearer when the speaker\nlacks it. In a way, testimony is not a foundational source of\nknowledge or justification. If preservationism (as anti-generativism)\nis true, memory is not a source either. Or, perhaps both can generate\nknowledge. Or, perhaps memory and testimony simply have distinct\nepistemic functions.\n\nAnother possible connection: memory is a kind of testimony.\nSpecifically, memory may merely be testimony to your current self from\nyour past self. Remembering is like reading your own diary. Your\njustification for believing what you seem to remember depends on your\nbackground justification for trusting your prior judgments and\ntrusting memory to indicate these judgments. This parallels a simple\nview about justification from testimony. Your justification for\nbelieving someone\u2019s testimony depends on your background\njustification for trusting what the testifier believes and trusting\nthis person\u2019s testimony to indicate her beliefs.\n\nThe diary view of memory may be wrong. It fits poorly with cases in\nwhich a subject recalls two beliefs that originally were unequal in\njustification but does not recall her original reasons for these\nbeliefs. The diary view of memory here counts the beliefs as equally\njustified. So it must contend that the reasons for the beliefs have\nchanged, even when it is stipulated that the subject has neither\nlearned nor forgotten anything relevant. The diary view incorrectly\ntreats some testimony from your former self equally (Barnett 2015).\nHere\u2019s another reason to doubt that memory is a kind of\ntestimony. When memory reports p, this is evidence that\np, rather than evidence about what memory reports (Weatherson\n2015). But when a testifier reports p, this isn\u2019t\nevidence that p, but rather evidence about what the testifier\nreports.\n\nIt could be that memory has a special connection to testimony, but one\nthat is problematic. Sometimes a subject experiences an event, and\nafterwards hears misleading testimony about the event. The subject may\nlater incorporate the content of that testimony when constructively\nrecollecting the event, and for that reason form a false belief about\nthe event. This is the much-discussed \u201cmisinformation\neffect\u201d (Loftus 1979 [1996]). Less discussed is the\n\u201cinformation effect\u201d. Here, the subject hears accurate\ntestimony about an event she has witnessed, and that testimony shapes\nhow she later reconstructively recollects the event, leading to a true\nbelief. Although the belief is accurate, it\u2019s accuracy may be\ndue to a kind of luck that prevents knowledge; at best this is a\n\u201cGettier case\u201d (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n Michaelian (2013) argues that when the information effect occurs, not\nonly does memory\u2019s reliability increase, but knowledge is also\nstill possible. The information effect does not involve\nproblematic luck. According to Shanton (2011), constructive\nrecollection in general is unreliable and leads to false belief in a\nnearby possible world. But she suggests it is more plausible that this\nrecollection can still yield knowledge, than that knowledge requires\neither reliability or no false belief in close worlds.\n3.2 Extended Mind\n\nCognitive processing may not be limited to biological\nbrain-processing. It may extend also to artifacts inside the skull, or\neven outside. A subject\u2019s notebook, for example, may be a part\nof his cognitive processing, in the way his memory is part of his\ncognitive processing (Clark & Chalmers 1998). Information stored\nin the notebook can be part of the subject\u2019s dispositional\nmemory knowledge (Carter & Kallestrup 2016). The subject does not\ninstead merely relearn the information upon accessing it. Knowledge\nmay not only extend to memory technology, but this knowledge may in\nways be better than knowledge from biomemory (Carter 2018; Heersmink\n& Carter 2020). It may for example be more stable and less\neffortful to maintain. Michaelian (2012a), however, argues that an\nimportant case for the extended cognition hypothesis fails. The case\nhighlights functional similarity between biomemory and alleged memory\nthat is external to the subject\u2019s body. The case specifically\nhas to do with their similar, purely preservative functioning. But,\nMichaelian argues, biomemory lacks this function, so alleged external\nmemory is not relevantly similar to biomemory after all. Notably, the\nview that biomemory has a purely preservative function has in part\nmotivated views about its epistemic powers, such as both versions of\npreservationism.\n3.3 Metacognition\n\nWe are not only cognitively active creatures, but we also monitor and\ncontrol our own cognitive activity, typically unreflectively. This\nmonitoring and controlling is metacognition. Memory involves\nmetacognition (Arango-Mu\u00f1oz 2013, 2014; Arango-Mu\u00f1oz\n& Michaelian 2014; Michaelian 2012b; Proust 2013). Thanks to\nmemory we retrieve information, but then we also evaluate it and our\nown retrieval of it. For example the information may not indicate its\norigin, and we use heuristics to determine a probable\none\u2014experience as opposed to, say, imagination. We also monitor\nhow quickly or slowly we retrieve the information, and our epistemic\nfeelings toward it (such as, say, a feeling of knowing). An\nendorsement mechanism controls for example whether we continue or\ncease to seek from memory the desired information.\n\nMichaelian (2012b) argues that the metacognitive endorsement mechanism\nis reliable and justifying despite its relying on sources of\ninformation that do not always deliver accurate information.\nMichaelian (2012c) argues that metacognitive monitoring helps\none\u2019s own memory to function reliably, yet that monitoring\ntestifiers for untrustworthiness is unimportant to testimony\u2019s\nreliability. Proust (2013) thinks metacognition helps us have\njustification, but contends that internalism about epistemic\njustification struggles to explain how this is so. Frise (2018c)\nargues that metacognition in memory supports a kind of internalism\nabout epistemic justification over process reliabilism.\n3.4 Knowledge-How\n\nThis entry has discussed memory and knowledge, but only one type of\nknowledge. The type is knowledge-that, or propositional knowledge.\nWhat is known here is, or has the form of, a proposition. Maria knows\nthat the 49ers should have won Super Bowl LIV, and this is\npropositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. Another type of knowledge\nis knowledge-how (see entry on\n knowledge how).\n Maria knows how to throw a football. This is knowledge-how.\n\nThere is much discussion of how these two types of knowledge relate. A\nstandard view is that they are importantly distinct types. A\ncontroversial view, however, is that knowledge-how consists in or\nrequires knowledge-that. This view is intellectualism. The\nphilosophy and psychology of memory might shed light on how the two\ntypes of knowledge relate. There is evidence that the two types rely\non distinct memory systems (Michaelian 2011c). Not all knowledge-how\ninvolves knowledge-that. Thus, intellectualism appears false.\nAdditionally, memory for how to execute physical actions, or\nremembering-how, appears closely related to knowledge-how.\nRemembering-how can endure longer than related propositional\nknowledge, allowing individuals with dementia to retain certain skills\n(Sutton & Williamson 2014). If remembering-how suffices for\nknowledge-how, this may be further evidence against intellectualism.\nThe subject has lost the knowledge-that while keeping the relevant\nknowledge-how.\n3.5 Forgetting\n\nForgetting is normatively significant. Not only does some of it invite\nmoral blame (Bernecker 2018), but it is essential to the\nepistemological problems of forgotten evidence and forgotten defeat.\nBut it is not entirely clear what forgetting is. And surprisingly\nlittle work addresses the nature of forgetting. Some forgetting is a\nprocess, other forgetting is a mental state; forgetting might have\ndifferent types of content (e.g., a proposition or an event or an\nexperience); forgetting involves some characteristic relation to its\ncontent that distinguishes it from other processes or states with the\nsame content; forgetting has some scale, either binary or a further\ngraded range (Frise 2018b).\n\nIt might seem commonsensical that forgetting, whatever it is exactly,\nis incompatible with knowing. What you forget, you no longer know. But\nperhaps sometimes a subject forgets what she still knows (Moon 2012b;\nPappas 1983, 1987). The forgetting may involve trying but failing to\nmentally access previously learned information. The information may be\nmentally accessible to the subject via her memory. The subject fails\nto access it, however. She still dispositionally knows what\nshe\u2019s forgetting. Other ways of forgetting are harder to square\nwith knowing. For example, some forgetting involves information being\nlost. And it\u2019s plausible that a subject does not still know\ninformation that she has lost.\n\nForgetting appears to be an epistemic defect, in part because some\nforgetting appears incompatible with knowing. It would be better not\nto forget, because not forgetting would allow for more\nknowing.\u00a0However forgetting might be a feature of a virtuously\nfunctioning memory system (Michaelian 2011a). Not forgetting, or too\nlittle forgetting, would be a problem. The problem wouldn\u2019t be\nthat human memory would run out of storage space, hampering further\nlearning. Rather, human memory works better by clearing out clutter,\nsuch as learned information we don\u2019t care about. Forgetting\nallows faster, more reliable recall, and perhaps a greater ratio of\nrecall for what we do care about.\n3.6 Skepticism\n\nMemory fails at times, as we have each experienced. As a result, we\nmight be inclined to inquire into memory\u2019s trustworthiness.\nInquiring may be unnecessary for our having justification. Perhaps\nmemory could provide it as long as there\u2019s no reason to doubt\nits trustworthiness (Moon 2017). Memory is trustworthy, and finding\nthis out is additional evidence in favor of what we believe via\nmemory. But memory still generates or preserves justification prior to\nour inquiry.\n\nOr perhaps if memory is to provide justification for a subject, she\nmust have reason to suppose her memory is trustworthy. It is not\nimmediately obvious what the relevant trustworthiness consists in. It\nmay be a matter of memory functioning in a certain way. And this could\nbe a matter of memory in general being reliable, tending to yield more\ntrue beliefs than false beliefs. A potential reason to suppose memory\nis reliable is that to suggest otherwise is, in a way, self-defeating\n(Locke 1971). To show memory is unreliable, we\u2019d presumably need\nto cite evidence of its failures. But this evidence comes from memory.\nSo if we show memory is unreliable, it is because memory supported\nbelieving something, namely, its own unreliability. So even if it is\nplausible that memory is unreliable, memory supports some\nbelieving.\n\nIt might not matter whether memory in general is reliable.\nPerhaps it just matters whether memory is reliable in the right\ncircumstances or for a certain range of beliefs, or whether a given\nmemory system is reliable, or whether a given memory is likely\ncorrect. An inference to the best explanation argument supports the\nlatter: a given memory, if accurate, can make better sense of why a\nsubject now experiences what that memory predicts she would experience\n(Hasan 2021).\n\nIf memory is to justify certain beliefs it might need to be\ntrustworthy in a different way. It might need to be\nconditionally reliable. Mere reliability is a matter of a\nprocess tending to yield more true beliefs than false beliefs.\nConditional reliability is a process tending to do this when all\nbelief inputs are true. Memory processing could be unreliable, yet\nconditionally reliable. It tends to yield false beliefs, but not when\nthe inputs to it (such as past beliefs) are all true. If, as per one\nsort of preservationism, memory cannot generate justification, it does\nnot seem to matter whether memory is reliable simpliciter. It just\nmatters whether memory is conditionally reliable. Its conditional\nreliability would allow memory to preserve the justification of a past\nbelief, according process reliabilism. Reliability simpliciter does\nnot matter for whether memory preserves justification. Reliability\nsimpliciter does matter for whether memory generates new\njustification, but preservationism (as anti-generativism) denies\nmemory can do this.\n\nInference to the best explanation may also support memory\u2019s\nconditional reliability. That memory is conditionally reliable is part\nof the best explanation of our having doxastic attitudes at all (Frise\n& McCain 2021). Suppose memory functions in a way where it\nsupplies us with doxastic attitudes, such as beliefs. If memory is not\ncreating all these attitudes anew, it is taking some attitudes as\ninputs and later on yielding attitudes as outputs. On the simpler and\nbetter accounts of how memory does this, it minimally changes the\ninput along the way. If there is no or little relevant change, the\nbelief output will have the same truth-value as the input, as it might\neven have the same content. So when all belief inputs to memory are\ntrue, memory tends to yield true beliefs rather than false beliefs. It\nis conditionally reliable.\n\nHowever, even if memory is trustworthy in all ways that matter, the\ntypical person may have an importantly flawed view of how some memory\nsystems work, such that the typical person fails to know via those\nmemory systems (Frise 2022). For instance, our folk understanding of\nepisodic memory fails to appreciate its constructive nature. Leaning\non this folk understanding may imperil knowledge of past events from\nepisodic memory, as it is plausible that a subject cannot know that\np if her justification for believing that p\nessentially depends on a falsehood.\n\nInstead of focusing on memory\u2019s trustworthiness, we might focus\non whether a given belief about the past is correct. Russell (1921)\npoints out that all or nearly all our beliefs about the past could be\nfalse. We might seem to remember various events and facts about what\nhas occurred. But we might have come to exist just five minutes ago.\nThe apparent past is misleading. Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nis similar to skeptical hypotheses concerning other alleged sources of\nknowledge and justification, such as perception. It is no surprise,\nthen, that many responses to Russell\u2019s skeptical hypothesis\nparallel responses to skepticism of other sorts (see entry on\n skepticism).",
