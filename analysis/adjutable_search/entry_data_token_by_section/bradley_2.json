    "main_text": "Philosophy of History\n3. Philosophy of History\n\nBradley\u2019s first substantial contribution to philosophy was the\npublication in 1874 of his pamphlet \u2018The Presuppositions of\nCritical History\u2019. Although it was not widely noticed at the\ntime, it did have an impact on the thinking of R.G. Collingwood, whose\nepistemology of history, like Bradley\u2019s, evinces a certain\nscepticism concerning historical facts and the authority of testimony,\nand it has had a considerable subsequent influence. Bradley\u2019s\nviews were inspired by his reading of German biblical critics, and\nsuch views have been prominent since in religious studies, where a\nreluctance to take at face value testimony of the occurrence of\nmiracles which violate the laws of nature is appropriate. But\nBradley\u2019s attempt to extend this reluctance to historical\nreports in general underestimates the contrast between the uniformity\nof nature and the variety of human history.\n\nAlthough its overall argument cannot be regarded as satisfactory, the\npamphlet is nevertheless worth reading both for its historical\nsignificance and for its value as a fairly brief introduction to\nBradley\u2019s thought. Some characteristic later themes, such as the\nfallibility of individual judgments and the rejection of\ncorrespondence accounts of truth, here make an early appearance; and\nBradley\u2019s philosophical style \u2014 often obscure, typically\ndisdainful of illustrative example, and by late twentieth-century\nstandards uncomfortably literary \u2014 can be seen in high\nrelief.\n",
