    "main_text": "Challenging the Concept of Indirect Discrimination || Is the Dispute Merely Terminological?\n3.2 Is the Dispute Merely Terminological?\n\n\nOne might suspect that any disagreement over whether indirect\ndiscrimination is really a form of discrimination is only a\nterminological one, devoid of any philosophical substance and capable\nof being adequately settled simply by the speaker stipulating how she\nis using the term \u2018discrimination\u2019 (Cavanagh 2002:\n199). One side in the disagreement could, then, stipulate that, as it\nis using the term, \u2018discrimination\u2019 applies only to direct\ndiscrimination, and the other side could stipulate that\n\u2018discrimination\u2019, as it is using the term, applies to\ndirect and indirect discrimination alike. However, the choice of\nterminology is not always philosophically innocent or unproblematic. A\npoor choice of terminology can lead to conceptual confusions and\nfallacious inferences. Cavanagh argues that precisely these sorts of\ninfelicities are fostered when \u2018discrimination\u2019 is used to\nrefer to a wrong that essentially depends on certain effects being\nvisited upon the members of a social group (2002: 199). Moreover, the\ncritics and the defenders of the term \u2018indirect\ndiscrimination\u2019 presumably agree with one another that the\nconcept of discrimination possesses a determinate meaning that either\nadmits, or does not admit, of an indirect form of discrimination. So\nit seems that the disagreement over indirect discrimination has\nphilosophical significance.\n\n\nThe possibility should be acknowledged that the concept of\ndiscrimination is insufficiently determinate to dictate an answer to\nthe question of whether there can be an indirect form of\ndiscrimination. In that case, any disagreement over the possibility of\nsuch discrimination would be devoid of philosophical substance and\nshould be settled by speaker stipulation. However, it would be hasty\nto arrive at the conclusion that there is no answer before a thorough\nexamination of the concept of discrimination is completed and some\njudgment is made about what the best account is of the concept. And a\nthorough examination must take up the question of why discrimination\nis wrong.\n",
