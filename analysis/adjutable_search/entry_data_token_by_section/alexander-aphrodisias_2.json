    "main_text": "Alexander as commentator\n2. Alexander as commentator\n\nIn general, Alexander goes on the assumption that Aristotelian\nphilosophy is a unified whole, providing systematically connected\nanswers to virtually all the questions of philosophy recognized in his\nown time. Where there is no single, clearly recognizable Aristotelian\npoint of view on some question, he leaves the matter undecided, citing\nseveral possibilities consistent with what Aristotle says. Sometimes\nAlexander tries to force an interpretation that does not obviously\nagree with the text, but he avoids stating that Aristotle contradicts\nhimself and, with rare exceptions, that he disagrees with him. Readers\nwill not always be convinced by his suggestions but they will often\nfind them helpful and informative where Aristotle is overly compressed\nand obscure. As a remark in his commentary on the Topics\nshows, Alexander was quite aware that his style of philosophic\ndiscussion was very different from that of the time of Aristotle\n(In top. 27,13): \u201cThis kind of speech [dialectic\nrefutation] was customary among the older philosophers, who set up\nmost of their classes in this way \u2014 not on the basis of books as\nis now done, since at the time there were not yet any books of this\nkind.\u201d As this explanation indicates, however, he seems to have\nregarded the bookishness of his own time as an advantage over the\ndialectic style rather than a disadvantage.\n\nLike the other commentaries in the ancient tradition, Alexander\u2019s\nderive from his courses of lectures (\u2018readings\u2019) on\nAristotle\u2019s works. In commenting, Alexander usually refrains from\ngiving comprehensive surveys. He generally starts with a preface on\nthe work\u2019s title, its scope and the nature of the subject matter. He\nthen takes up individual passages in rough succession by citing a line\nor two (this provides the \u2018lemma\u2019 for the ensuing\ndiscussion) and explaining what he considers as problematic (in\nexplanatory paraphrases, clarifications of expressions, or refutations\nof the views of others), often in view of what Aristotle says about\nthe issue elsewhere. This procedure clearly presupposes that the\nstudents had their own texts at hand and were sufficiently familiar\nwith Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as a whole. Alexander does not generally\ngo through the text line by line, but chooses to discuss certain\nissues while omitting others. Paraphrases are interrupted by\nclarifications of terminology, and sometimes, at crucial points, by\nnotes on divergent readings in different manuscripts and a\njustification of his own preference concerning Aristotle\u2019s original\nwords. Decisions on such philological problems are based on what makes\nbetter sense in conforming with Aristotle\u2019s intentions here or\nelsewhere. As Alexander indicates, such philological explorations were\nconsidered as part of the commentator\u2019s work (cf. On Aristotle\nMetaphysics A, 59, 1\u20139): \u201cThe first reading,\nhowever, is better; this makes it clear that the Forms are causes of\nthe essence for the other things, and the One for the Forms. Aspasius\nrelates that the former is the more ancient reading, but that it was\nlater changed by Eudorus and Euharmostus.\u201d Alexander\u2019s concern\nwith textual problems makes him a valuable source for textual\ncriticism, as can be seen from Kotwick\u2019s (2016) monograph on the text\nof Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\n\nThough Alexander follows the Aristotelian texts quite conscientiously,\nhe often concentrates on special points and the respective passages\nwhile passing over others with brief remarks. Thus in his comments on\nthe first book of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics he devotes more\nthan half of his exegesis to the two chapters in which Aristotle\nattacks Plato\u2019s theory of Forms (Metaph. A, 6 & 9). Since\nAristotle there focuses on Plato\u2019s attempt to connect the Forms with\nnumbers, a theory that is not elaborated in the dialogues, Alexander\u2019s\ndisquisition turns out to be our most valuable source on the vexed\nquestion of Plato\u2019s Unwritten Doctrine and also on the impact of this\ndoctrine on the members of the Early Academy (see Harlfinger &\nLeszl, 1975; Fine 1993). Though on the whole Alexander adopts\nAristotle\u2019s critical stance towards Plato\u2019s separate Forms, he\nsometimes at least indicates the possibility of dissent. When, for\ninstance, Aristotle claims that Plato recognizes only two of his own\nfour causes, the formal and the material cause, Alexander refers to\nthe demiurge\u2019s activities in the Timaeus as an example for an\nefficient cause acting for the sake of a final cause. But then he adds\na justification to explain why Aristotle acknowledges neither of the\ntwo causes in his report on Plato (59,28\u201360,2): \u201cThe\nreason is either because Plato did not mention either of these in what\nhe said about the causes, as Aristotle has shown in his treatise\nOn the Good; or because he did not make them causes of the\nthings involved in generation and destruction, and did not even\nformulate any complete theory about them.\u201d\n\nThere is not room here to discuss each of Alexander\u2019s commentaries\nindividually. Some remarks on his treatment of Aristotle\u2019s logic in\nhis commentary on Prior Analytics I can serve the purpose of\na general survey (cf. the Introduction in trsl. Barnes et al. 1991).\nAs his explanations show, Alexander was fully familiar with the\ndevelopment of logic after Aristotle, under Theophrastus and the\nStoics. On the whole, he presents the Aristotelian kind of logic as\nthe obviously right one, treating the Stoic approach as wrong-headed.\nWhen he confronts problems in Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic he sometimes\nexpresses bafflement, and indicates the difficulties or even\ninconsistencies he sees in the text. But he usually tries to smooth\nthem over or offers an alleged Aristotelian solution. In any case he\navoids, if at all possible, openly criticizing Aristotle or\ncontradicting him. As his analyses show, Alexander was not an original\nlogician with innovative ideas of his own, as was his contemporary,\nGalen. He does not always get Aristotle right and sometimes blunders\nin his exegesis. In addition, his style is uninviting. If Aristotle is\nhard to comprehend on account of his clipped and elliptic style,\nAlexander is often hard to follow because of his long and tortuous\nperiods. In the past this has made his commentary on the Prior\nAnalytics inaccessible to all but experts. The English\ntranslations try to make up for these deficiencies by cutting up long\nperiods into shorter sentences. This will greatly enhance the\nusefulness of Alexander\u2019s reconstruction and assessment of those\naspects of Aristotle\u2019s logic that are still a matter of controversy\nnowadays.\n\nThe idea that discrepancies in Aristotle\u2019s texts are due to the\ndevelopment of his philosophy was as alien to Alexander as it was to\nall other thinkers in antiquity. Instead, he treats Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy as a unitary whole and tries to systematize it by forging\ntogether different trains of thought, and smoothing over\ninconsistencies. Thereby he contributed to the emergence of what was\nto become the canonical \u2018Aristotelianism\u2019 that was\nattacked in early modern times as a severe obstacle to new ideas and\nscientific development. Though Alexander indicates that he was aware\nof changes at particular points (he regarded the Categories\nas Aristotle\u2019s earliest work and notes that it does not yet observe\nthe systematic distinction between genus and species), he does not\nconsider the possibility that there were different phases with\nsubstantial changes in the Master\u2019s work. If such conservatism\nsurprises us in view of the fact that Alexander\u2019s own work shows\ntraces of revisions and improvement, we must keep in mind that in the\neyes of \u2018The Commentator\u2019 Aristotle was an authority quite\noutside the common order. The doctrine of the Master was not the\nproduct of an ordinary human mind, subject to trial and error, but a\nmagisterial achievement in a class of its own.\n",
