    "main_text": "Identity and Membership: Who Belongs to What? || Members and Associates\n2.3 Members and Associates\n\n\u014chashi Ry\u014dsuke\u2019s thesis, advanced already in his\nlandmark German anthology, Die Philosophie der\nKy\u014dto-Schule (1990, revised edition 2012; see also\n\u014chashi and Akitomi 2018), is that the Kyoto School should be\nunderstood as a group of thinkers involved in a pluralistic yet\ncooperative and sustained attempt to think on the basis of an idea of\n\u201cnothingness\u201d or \u201cabsolute nothingness.\u201d This\ndistinguishes their thought from that of traditional Western onto-logy\nbased on the concept of \u201cbeing.\u201d With this definition in\nmind, \u014chashi lists the central members of the Kyoto School\naccording to generation as follows: Nishida and Tanabe make up the\nfirst generation; Hisamatsu, Nishitani, K\u014dsaka Masaaki\n(1900\u20131969), Shimomura Toratar\u014d (1900\u20131995),\nK\u014dyama Iwao (1905\u20131993), and Suzuki Shigetaka\n(1907\u20131988) make up the second generation; and Takeuchi\nYoshinori (1913\u20132002), Tsujimura K\u014dichi (1922\u20132010),\nand Ueda Shizuteru make up the third generation. Elsewhere he also\nsuggests that the psychologist Kimura Bin (b. 1931) could be\nconsidered part of the third generation of the School, particularly if\nwe shift the criterion of definition from interpersonal relations to a\ngenealogy of thought (\u014chashi 2004, 9).\n\nUeda developed an original philosophy of Zen in relation to Meister\nEckhart and Nishida. Takeuchi wrote important works on the philosophy\nof religion from a Shin Buddhist perspective. Tsujimura, who studied\nunder Heidegger as well as under Hisamatsu and Nishitani, has\nprovocatively and influentially written on Heidegger\u2019s thought\nfrom a Zen and Kyoto School perspective. Abe Masao (1915\u20132006),\na former student of Hisamatsu\u2019s, was an important representative\nof the Kyoto School and contributor to inter-religious dialogue in\nNorth America, although he is somewhat less well known in Japan\nitself. If we were to view the Kyoto School as living past its third\ngeneration, \u014chashi Ry\u014dsuke (b. 1944), a prolific philosopher\nin his own right, whose works in both Japanese and German address a\nbroad range of philosophical issues, would undoubtedly count as a\ncentral figure of its fourth generation. Other recent affiliates of\nthe School, who could be seen as belonging to its fourth generation,\ninclude Hase Sh\u014dt\u014d, Horio Tsutomu, \u014cmine Akira, Fujita\nMasakatsu, Mori Tetsur\u014d, Hanaoka (Kawamura) Eiko, Matsumura\nHideo, Nakaoka Narifumi, Okada Katsuaki, and Keta Masako. If the\nSchool shows promise of living on to future generations, it is with\ncurrently active Japanese scholars such as Akitomi Katsuya, Minobe\nHitoshi, Itabashi Y\u016bjin, Uehara Mayuko, Inoue Katsuhito, Mine\nHideki, Kosaka Kunitsugu, Tanaka Y\u016b, and Tanaka Ky\u016bbun, and\nas well as with a number of Japanese and non-Japanese philosophers\nliving outside of Japan, some of whom have studied and worked\nextensively with members of the third and fourth generations of the\nSchool.\n\nWe appear to be at a turning point in the history of the Kyoto School,\nas is reflected in current retrospective attempts to define it. With\nUeda\u2019s and then Hase\u2019s retirements from Kyoto University,\non the one hand, and with the creation in 1996 of a Department of the\nHistory of Japanese Philosophy at Kyoto University (see the website\nlisted below) under the head of Fujita Masakatsu and now Uehara Mayuko\non the other, the Kyoto School is becoming as much an object of\nscholarship as it is a living tradition. However, as with most schools\nof philosophy, the line between critical scholarship and creative\ndevelopment is hardly a clear one, and in practice the retrospective\nstudy of the Kyoto School often blends together with its further\nunfolding as a still vibrant school of thought.\n\nIt is also important to point out that today in Japan the Kyoto School\nis not only studied in Kyoto. Since the appearance of Tokyo-based\nphilosopher Nakamura Y\u016bji\u014d\u2019s first book on Nishida in\n1983, Nishida and the Kyoto School have increasingly received\nattention from scholars and students in areas of Japan beyond Kyoto.\nWorth special mention in this regard is Kosaka Kunitsugu, whose lucid\nand prolific scholarship on Nishida and others has done a great deal\nfor the sympathetic yet sober textual analysis of the Kyoto School.\nThe creation of the Nishida Philosophy Association in 2003 (see the\nwebsite listed below) has helped inaugurate a new era of cooperative\nexchange between scholars from various areas of Japan as well as from\nabroad.\n\nOne final point on the question of membership: consideration should\nalso be given to those who could be referred to as \u201crelated\nthinkers\u201d or \u201cassociate members\u201d of the Kyoto\nSchool. The widest understandings (or\n misunderstandings[3])\n of the Kyoto School include in it a number of thinkers who have a\nmore or less peripheral relation to the inner circle of the School.\nFor example, there is the case of the well-known Zen scholar and\nthinker, D. T. Suzuki (Suzuki Daisetsu) (1870\u20131966). Suzuki\nmaintained a long personal relationship with Nishida since their days\nas schoolmates. He not only helped introduce the young Nishida to the\npractice of Zen, his articulation of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist\nthought is also acknowledged by Nishida as having influenced the\nformation of certain key ideas in his last essay on the philosophy of\nreligion (see Nishida 1987, 70, 85\u201386, 108, 122\u201323). But\nSuzuki\u2014who is justifiably famous in his own right for, among\nother things, helping introduce Zen to the West\u2014was neither\ntrained as an academic philosopher nor associated with Kyoto\nUniversity; and thus he is perhaps best thought of as a \u201cclosely\nrelated thinker\u201d to the School.\n\nThere are also the noteworthy cases of Watsuji Tetsur\u014d\n(1889\u20131960) and Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d (1888\u20131941). Both of\nthese philosophers were brought to Kyoto University by Nishida, and\nboth developed philosophies which were more or less influenced by\nNishida\u2019s thought (see Maraldo 2005, 34 and 52). And yet, both\ntheir ideas and their activities remained too independent to count\nthem among the inner circle of the School. It should be kept in mind,\nhowever, that these two \u201cassociates\u201d in particular are\nfirst rate philosophers in their own right, whose original work\noutshines that of many of the less original though full-fledged\nmembers of the School. Watsuji\u2019s novel theory of \u201cculture\nand climate\u201d (f\u016bdo), together with his major work\non the ethics of \u201cbetweenness\u201d (aidagara), and\nKuki\u2019s combination of logical rigor and existential insight in\nhis major writings on the problem of contingency, together with his\nprovocative works on Japanese aesthetics (notably his hermeneutical\nphenomenology of \u201ciki\u201d), have each made lasting\ncontributions to philosophy and are worthy of international scholarly\nattention (see the entry on Watsuji Tetsur\u014d; McCarthy 2020;\nMayeda 2020).\n\nFinally, there is the matter of thinkers who have developed their\nideas more or less under the influence of Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School. A complete list of this group of \u201cinfluenced\nthinkers\u201d would be long, but it would include such names as\nTakahashi Satomi, Takizawa Katsumi, Mutai Risaku, Yuasa Yasuo, Kimura\nBin, Sakabe Megumi, Nakamura Y\u016bjir\u014d, and Noe Keiichi. A\nnumber of non-philosophers, such as the world-famous architect\nAnd\u014d Tadao (Tadao Ando), who designed the Ishikawa Nishida Kitaro\nMuseum of Philosophy (see the website listed below), have also been\ninfluenced by Nishida and the Kyoto School.\n",
