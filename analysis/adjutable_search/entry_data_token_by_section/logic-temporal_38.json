    "main_text": "Combining temporal and other logics || Temporal logics and logics of agency\n9.2 Temporal logics and logics of agency\n\nTemporal reasoning is an important aspect of reasoning about agents\nand their actions. The probably most influential family of logics of\nagency in philosophical studies is the family of so-called\nstit logics, originating from the work of Belnap and Perloff\n(1988). These logics contain formulae of the form\nstit\\(\\varphi\\), reading \u201cThe agent sees to it that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d, which allow one to reason about how an\nagent\u2019s choices to act bear on the world. The original versions\nof stit logic do not involve temporal operators.\nNevertheless, their semantics is based on Ockhamist branching time\nmodels, where an agent\u2019s set of choices at a given time instant\nis represented by a partition of the set of histories passing through\nthat instant. Intuitively, the formula stit\\(\\varphi\\) is\ntrue at a given time instant \\(t\\) with respect to a given history\n\\(h\\) iff the agent\u2019s choice at the instant \\(t\\) with respect\nto the history \\(h\\) guarantees that \\(\\varphi\\), i.e. if \\(\\varphi\\)\nis true at \\(t\\) relative to all histories in the respective choice\ncell. For a detailed discussion of varieties of stit logic\nand their historical development, see Belnap et al. (2001) and the\nentry on\n the logic of action.\n Temporal extensions of stit logics have been proposed in\nBroersen (2011) and Lorini (2013): in Broersen (2011) the\nstit operator is combined with the Next Time\noperator \\(X\\) into a single operator which requires that the\nobjective be met in the next step, whereas in Lorini (2013) the\nstit operator and the temporal operators are treated\nseparately.\n\nAnother important family of temporal logics of agency are the\nalternating-time logics ATL and ATL*, introduced in Alur et\nal. (2002). ATL and ATL* are multi-agent extensions of the computation\ntree logics CTL and CTL*, and they have become a popular logical\nframework for strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems.\nAlternating-time temporal logics enrich the language with strategic\npath quantifiers \\(\\langle\\!\\langle C \\rangle\\!\\rangle \\varphi,\\)\nintuitively saying \u201cThe coalition \\(C\\) has a collective\nstrategy to guarantee that the objective \\(\\varphi\\) is met on every\npath enabled by that collective strategy\u201d, where the objective\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a temporal formula. While stit logics build on\nthe rather abstract notion of a history, ATL and ATL* are interpreted\nover so-called concurrent game structures, in which paths are viewed\nas sequences of successor states that are generated by discrete\ntransitions caused by collective actions of all agents. A combination\nof ATL and stit theory was developed in Broersen et al.\n(2006). The branching time logics CTL and CTL* can be regarded as\nsingle-agent versions of ATL and ATL*. Even though the latter are\nquite more expressive, they generally preserve the good computational\nproperties of the former. For further details, see Alur et al. (2002),\nas well as Goranko and van Drimmelen (2006), where a complete\naxiomatization and decidability results for ATL are established. A\ngeneral introduction to ATL from a temporal logic perspective is\nprovided in Demri et al. (2016, Chapter 9).\n",
