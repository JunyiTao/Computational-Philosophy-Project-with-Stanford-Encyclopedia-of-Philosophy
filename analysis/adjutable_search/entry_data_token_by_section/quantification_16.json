    "main_text": "Quantification and Ontology || Unrestricted Quantification\n4.3 Unrestricted Quantification\n\nWhen Quine answers \u201ceverything\u201d to the fundamental\nontological question of what there is, he presumably intends the\nquantifier to range unrestrictedly over all objects at once. This\nobservation applies to ontological inquiry more generally. When a\nnominalist asserts that there are no mathematical objects, she does\nnot intend the thesis to be qualified by a restriction to a domain of\nconcrete objects; otherwise, the thesis would be devoid of interest.\nBut unrestricted quantification is not a very common phenomenon\noutside highly theoretical contexts such as logic and ontology. Take a\ntypical use of a quantifier expression in English as exemplified in a\ntypical utterance of the sentence:\n\n(11) Everything is on\nsale.\n\n\nIn a typical context, the use of the quantifier\n\u201ceverything\u201d is tacitly restricted to a domain of\ncontextually salient objects. In particular, it would be inappropriate\nfor another participant in the conversation to point out that the Moon\nis not on sale. The Moon is not an exception to the statement made by\nmy utterance of (11) because the Moon does not lie in the domain of\nquantification associated to my use of the quantifier.\n\nBut the fact that unrestricted quantification is relatively uncommon\nis no reason to doubt it is attainable in certain contexts.\nUnfortunately, many philosophers have recently doubted that genuinely\nunrestricted quantification is even coherent, much less\n attainable.[21]\n Note that these philosophers face at least two preliminary\nchallenges, both of which are forcefully pressed by Williamson (2003).\nFirst, they face the question of what to make of the prospects of\nontological inquiry without unrestricted generality. How should we\nformulate substantive ontological positions such as nominalism, if we\ncannot hope to quantify over all objects at once? The second challenge\nfor the skeptics is to state their own position. To the extent to\nwhich the thesis that we cannot quantify over everything appears to\nentail that there is something over which cannot quantify, skeptics\nseem to find themselves in a bind by inadvertently quantifying over\nwhat, by their own lights, lies beyond a legitimate domain of\n quantification.[22]\n Typical responses to each problem involve a surrogate for\nunrestricted generality in the form of either schematic generality or\nthe use of certain modal operators to simulate quantification over a\nseries of ever more comprehensive domains of\n quantification.[23]\n\nAt the core of the problem lies the assumption that the set-theoretic\nparadoxes cast doubt upon the existence of a comprehensive domain of\nall objects. What they reveal, according to Dummett (1991, 1993), is\nthe existence of indefinitely extensible concepts like set,\nordinal, and object. For Dummett, the indefinite\nextensibility of set is incompatible with the existence of a\ncomprehensive domain of all sets, since no matter what putative domain\nof all sets we isolate, we find that we can employ Russell\u2019s\nreasoning to characterize further sets that lie beyond the putative\ndomain of all sets with which we began. The set of all\nnon-self-membered sets in the initial domain cannot, on pain of\ncontradiction, be in that domain, which means that it must lie in a\nmore comprehensive domain of all sets. If there is no domain of all\nsets, there is, the thought continues, no hope for a domain of all\nobjects. One may respond to this line of argument by contesting\nDummett\u2019s diagnosis of the set-theoretic antinomies. Boolos\n(1993) suggests that we take Russell\u2019s paradox, for example, to\nestablish that not every condition determines a set. The moral of\nRussell\u2019s paradox is that there is no set of all\nnon-self-membered sets, not that it lies beyond the initial domain of\nquantification.\n\nFor another line of attack against the coherence of unrestricted\nquantification, one may ask what exactly is a domain of quantification\nsupposed to be. Skeptics often take a page from modern model theory\nand think of a domain of quantification as a set\u2014or at least as\na set-like object, which contains as members all objects over which\nthe putatively unrestricted quantifier is supposed to range. They take\nfor granted that for a speaker to be able to quantify over some\nobjects, they must all be members of some set-like object, which\nconstitutes a domain of quantification. Cartwright (1994) called this\nthesis the All-in-One Principle. Now, if there is unrestricted\nquantification, then the domain of quantification associated to it\ncannot be a set-like object. For we could then deploy a suitable\nvariation on Russell\u2019s paradox in order to obtain a\n contradiction.[24]\n Many have concluded from this that there is no genuinely unrestricted\nquantification over all objects at once.\n\nThe All-in-One principle is not beyond doubt. One application of\nplural quantification, which is explored by Cartwright (1994), is to\nabandon the All-in-One principle and to understand talk of a domain of\nquantification not as singular talk of collections but rather as\nplural talk of its members. To speak of a domain of certain objects is\njust to speak of the objects themselves\u2014or to speak of a\nfirst-level concept under which they all fall; and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is to claim of the object that it is\none of them. Alternatively, one may opt for the expressive resources\nof second-order quantification with the second-order quantifiers taken\nto range over Fregean concepts. Williamson (2003) outlines a\nconception of a domain of quantification as a Fregean concept under\nwhich certain objects may fall. To speak of a domain of all objects on\nthis view is to speak of a Fregean concept under which all\nobjects\u2014without restriction\u2014fall, and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is merely to claim that the object\nfalls under the relevant Fregean concept.\n",
