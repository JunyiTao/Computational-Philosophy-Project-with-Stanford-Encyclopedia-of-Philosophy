    "main_text": "Making real decisions || Jeffrey\u2019s theory\n3.2 Jeffrey\u2019s theory\n\nRichard Jeffrey\u2019s expected utility theory differs from\nSavage\u2019s in terms of both the prospects (i.e., options)\nunder consideration and the rationality constraints on\npreferences over these prospects. The distinct advantage of\nJeffrey\u2019s theory is that real-world decision problems can be\nmodelled just as the agent perceives them; the plausibility of the\nrationality constraints on preference do not depend on decision\nproblems being modelled in a particular way. We first describe the\nprospects or decision set-up and the resultant expected utility rule,\nbefore turning to the pertinent rationality constraints on preferences\nand the corresponding theorem.\n\nUnlike Savage, Jeffrey does not make a distinction between the objects\nof instrumental and non-instrumental desire (acts and outcomes\nrespectively) and the objects of belief (states of the world). Rather,\nJeffrey assumes that propositions describing states of\naffairs are the objects of both desire and belief. On first sight,\nthis seems unobjectionable: just as we can have views about whether it\nwill in fact rain, we can also have views about how desirable that\nwould be. The uncomfortable part of this setup is that acts, too, are\njust propositions\u2014they are ordinary states of affairs about\nwhich an agent has both beliefs and desires. Just as the agent has a\npreference ordering over, say, possible weather scenarios for the\nweekend, she has a preference ordering over the possible acts that she\nmay perform, and in neither case is the most preferred state of\naffairs necessarily the most likely to be true. In other words, the\nonly thing that picks out acts as special is their substantive\ncontent\u2014these are the propositions that the agent has the power\nto choose/make true in the given situation. It is as if the agent\nassesses her own options for acting from, rather, a third-person\nperspective. If one holds that a decision model should convincingly\nrepresent the subjective perspective of the agent in question, this is\narguably a weakness of Jeffrey\u2019s theory, although it may be one\nwithout\n consequence.[10]\n\nBefore proceeding, a word about propositions may be helpful: they are\nabstract objects that can be either true or false, and are commonly\nidentified with sets of possible worlds. A possible world can be\nthought of as an abstract representation of how things are or could be\n(Stalnaker 1987; see also entry on\n possible worlds).\n The proposition that it rains at time \\(t\\), for example, is just the\nset of all worlds where it rains at time \\(t\\). And this particular\nproposition is true just in case the actual world happens to be a\nmember of the set of all worlds where it rains at time \\(t\\). \n\nThe basic upshot of Jeffrey\u2019s theory is that the desirability of\na proposition, including one representing acts, depends both on the\ndesirabilities of the different ways in which the proposition can be\ntrue, and the relative probability that it is true in these respective\nways. To state this more precisely, \\(p\\), \\(q\\), etc., will denote\npropositional variables. Let \\(\\{p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n\\}\\) be one\namongst many finite partitions of the proposition \\(p\\); that is, sets\nof mutually incompatible but jointly exhaustive ways in which the\nproposition \\(p\\) can be realised. For instance, if \\(p\\) is the\nproposition that it is raining, then we could partition this\nproposition very coarsely according to whether we go to the beach or\nnot, but we could also partition \\(p\\) much more finely, for instance\naccording to the precise millimetres-per-hour amount of rain. The\ndesirability of \\(p\\) according to Jeffrey, denoted \\(Des(p)\\), is\ngiven by:\n\nJeffrey\u2019s equation.\n\n\\(Des(p)=\\sum_i Des(p_i)\\cdot P(p_i\\mid p)\\) \n\nThis is effectively a conditional expected utility formula\nfor evaluating \\(p\\). As noted, a special case is when the content of\n\\(p\\) is such that it is recognisably something the agent can choose\nto make true, i.e., an act.\n\nOne important difference between Jeffrey\u2019s desirability formula\nand Savage\u2019s expected utility formula, is that there is no\ndistinction made between desirability and \u201cexpected\u201d\ndesirability, unlike what has to be done in Savage\u2019s theory,\nwhere there is a clear distinction between utility, measuring an\nagent\u2019s fundamental desires for ultimate outcomes, and expected\nutility, measuring an agent\u2019s preferences over uncertain\nprospects or acts. This disanalogy is due to the fact that there is no\nsense in which the \\(p_i\\)s that \\(p\\) is evaluated in terms of need\nto be ultimate outcomes; they can themselves be thought of as\nuncertain prospects that are evaluated in terms of their different\npossible realisations.\n\nAnother important thing to notice about Jeffrey\u2019s way of\ncalculating desirability, is that it does not assume probabilistic\nindependence between the alternative that is being evaluated, \\(p\\),\nand the possible ways, the \\(p_i\\)s, that the alternative may be\nrealised. Indeed, the probability of each \\(p_i\\) is explicitly\nconditional on the \\(p\\) in question. When it comes to evaluating\nacts, this is to say (in Savage\u2019s terminology) that the\nprobabilities for the possible state-outcome pairs for the act are\nconditional on the act in question. Thus we see why the agent can\ndescribe her decision problem just as she sees it; there is no\nrequirement that she identify a set of states (in Jeffrey\u2019s\ncase, this would be a partition of the proposition space that is\northogonal to the act partition) such that the states are\nappropriately fine-grained and probabilistically independent of the\nacts.\n\nIt should moreover be evident, given the discussion of the Sure Thing\nPrinciple (STP) in\n Section 3.1,\n that Jeffrey\u2019s theory does not have this axiom. Since states\nmay be probabilistically dependent on acts, an agent can be\nrepresented as maximising the value of Jeffrey\u2019s desirability\nfunction while violating the STP. Moreover, unlike Savage\u2019s,\nJeffrey\u2019s representation theorem does not depend on anything\nlike the Rectangular Field Assumption. The agent is not required to\nhave preferences over artificially constructed acts or propositions\nthat turn out to be nonsensical, given the interpretation of\nparticular states and outcomes. In fact, only those propositions the\nagent considers to be possible (in the sense that she assigns them a\nprobability greater than zero) are, according to Jeffrey\u2019s\ntheory, included in her preference ordering.\n\nOf course, we still need certain structural assumptions in order to\nprove a representation theorem for Jeffrey\u2019s theory. In\nparticular, the set \\(\\Omega\\), on which the preference ordering\n\\(\\preceq\\) is defined, has to be an atomless Boolean algebra\nof propositions, from which the impossible propositions, denoted\n\\(\\bot\\), have been removed. A Boolean algebra is just a set of e.g.\npropositions or sentences that is closed under the classical logical\noperators and negation. An algebra is atomless just in case all of its\nelements can be partitioned into finer elements. The assumption that\n\\(\\Omega\\) is atomless is thus similar to Savage\u2019s\n P6,\n and can be given a similar justification: any way \\(p_i\\) in which\n\\(p\\) can be true can be partitioned into two further propositions\naccording to how some coin would land if tossed.\n\nSo under what conditions can a preference relation \\(\\preceq\\) on the\nset \\(\\Omega\\) be represented as maximising desirability? Some of the\nrequired conditions on preference should be familiar by now and will\nnot be discussed further. In particular, \\(\\preceq\\) has to be\ntransitive, complete and continuous (recall our discussion in\n Section 2.3\n of vNM\u2019s Continuity preference axiom).\n\nThe next two conditions are, however, not explicitly part of the two\nrepresentation theorems that have been considered so far:\n\n\nAveraging\n\nIf \\(p,\\ q\\in \\Omega\\) are mutually incompatible, then \n\n\\[p\\preceq q\\Leftrightarrow p\\preceq p\\cup q\\preceq q\\]\n\n\nImpartiality\n\nSuppose \\(p,\\ q\\in \\Omega\\) are mutually incompatible and \\(p\\sim q\\).\nThen if \\(p\\cup r\\sim q\\cup r\\) for some \\(r\\) that is\nmutually incompatible with both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and is such that\n\\(\\neg(r\\sim p)\\), then \\(p\\cup r\\sim q\\cup r\\) for every\nsuch \\(r\\).\n\n\nAveraging is the distinguishing rationality condition in\nJeffrey\u2019s theory. It can actually be seen as a weak version of\nIndependence and the Sure Thing Principle, and it plays a similar role\nin Jeffrey\u2019s theory. But it is not directly inconsistent with\nAllais\u2019 preferences, and its plausibility does not depend on the\ntype of probabilistic independence that the STP implies. The postulate\nrequires that no proposition be strictly better or worse than all of\nits possible realisations, which seems to be a reasonable requirement.\nWhen \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are mutually incompatible, \\(p\\cup q\\) implies\nthat either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) is true, but not both. Hence, it seems\nreasonable that \\(p\\cup q\\) should be neither strictly more nor less\ndesirable than both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Suppose one of \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) is\nmore desirable than the other. Then since \\(p\\cup q\\) is compatible\nwith the truth of either the more or the less desirable of the two,\n\\(p\\cup q\\)\u2019s desirability should fall strictly between that of\n\\(p\\) and that of \\(q\\). However, if \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are equally\ndesirable, then \\(p\\cup q\\) should be as desirable as each of the\ntwo.\n\nThe intuitive appeal of Impartiality, which plays a similar role in\nJeffrey\u2019s theory as P4 does in Savage\u2019s, is not as great\nas that of Averaging. Jeffrey himself admitted as much in his comment:\n\n\n\nThe axiom is there because we need it, and it is justified by our\nantecedent belief in the plausibility of the result we mean to deduce\nfrom it. (1965: 147) \n\n\nNevertheless, it does seem that an argument can be made that any\nreasonable person will satisfy this axiom. Suppose you are indifferent\nbetween two propositions, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), that cannot be\nsimultaneously true. And suppose now we find a proposition \\(r\\), that\nis pairwise incompatible with both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), and which you find\nmore desirable than both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Then if it turns out that\nyou are indifferent between \\(p\\) joined with \\(r\\) and \\(q\\) joined\nwith \\(r\\), that must be because you find \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) equally\nprobable. Otherwise, you would prefer the union that contains the one\nof \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) that you find less probable, since that gives you a\nhigher chance of the more desirable proposition \\(r\\). It then follows\nthat for any other proposition \\(s\\) that satisfies the aforementioned\nconditions that \\(r\\) satisfies, you should also be indifferent\nbetween \\(p\\cup s\\) and \\(q\\cup s\\), since, again, the two unions are\nequally likely to result in \\(s\\).\n\nThe first person to prove a theorem stating sufficient conditions for\na preference relation to be representable as maximising the value of a\nJeffrey-desirability function was actually not Jeffrey himself, but\nthe mathematician Ethan Bolker (1966, 1967). He proved the following\nresult (recall the definition of a \u201cdesirability measure\u201d\ngiven\n above):[11]\n\nTheorem 4 (Bolker)\n\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be a complete and atomless Boolean algebra of\npropositions, and \\(\\preceq\\) a continuous, transitive and complete\nrelation on \\(\\Omega \\setminus \\bot \\), that satisfies Averaging and\nImpartiality. Then there is a desirability measure on \\(\\Omega\n\\setminus \\bot \\) and a probability measure on \\(\\Omega\\) relative to\nwhich \\(\\preceq\\) can be represented as maximising desirability.\n\nUnfortunately, Bolker\u2019s representation theorem does not yield a\nresult anywhere near as unique as Savage\u2019s. Even if a\nperson\u2019s preferences satisfy all the conditions in\nBolker\u2019s theorem, then it is neither guaranteed that there will\nbe just one probability function that represents her beliefs nor that\nthe desirability function that represents her desires will be unique\nup to a positive linear transformation (unless her preferences are\nunbounded). Even worse, the same preference ordering satisfying all\nthese axioms could be represented as maximising desirability relative\nto two probability functions that do not even agree on how to order\npropositions according to their\n probability.[12]\n\nFor those who think that the only way to determine a person\u2019s\ncomparative beliefs is to look at her preferences, the lack of\nuniqueness in Jeffrey\u2019s theory is a big problem. Indeed, this\nmay be one of the main reasons why economists have largely ignored\nJeffrey\u2019s theory. Economists have traditionally been skeptical\nof any talk of a person\u2019s desires and beliefs that goes beyond\nwhat can be established by examining the person\u2019s preferences,\nwhich they take to be the only attitude that is directly revealed by a\nperson\u2019s behaviour. For these economists, it is therefore\nunwelcome news if we cannot even in principle determine the\ncomparative beliefs of a rational person by looking at her\npreferences.\n\nThose who are less inclined towards behaviourism might, however, not\nfind this lack of uniqueness in Bolker\u2019s theorem to be a\nproblem. James Joyce (1999), for instance, thinks that Jeffrey\u2019s\ntheory gets things exactly right in this regard, since one should not\nexpect that reasonable conditions imposed on a person\u2019s\npreferences would suffice to determine a unique probability function\nrepresenting the person\u2019s beliefs. It is only by imposing overly\nstrong conditions, as Savage does, that we can achieve this. However,\nif uniqueness is what we are after, then we can, as Joyce points out,\nsupplement the Bolker-Jeffrey axioms with certain conditions on the\nagent\u2019s comparative belief relation (e.g. those proposed by\nVillegas 1964) that, together with the Bolker-Jeffrey axioms, ensure\nthat the agent\u2019s preferences can be represented by a unique\nprobability function and a desirability function that is unique up to\na positive linear transformation.\n\nInstead of adding specific belief-postulates to Jeffrey\u2019s\ntheory, as Joyce suggests, one can get the same uniqueness result by\nenriching the set of prospects. Richard Bradley (1998) has, for\ninstance, shown that if one extends the Boolean algebra in\nJeffrey\u2019s theory to indicative conditionals, then a preference\nrelation on the extended domain that satisfies the Bolker-Jeffrey\naxioms (and some related axioms that specifically apply to\nconditionals) will be representable as maximising desirability, where\nthe probability function is unique and the desirability function is\nunique up to a positive linear transformation.\n4. Broader implications of Expected Utility (EU) theory\n\nIt was noted from the outset that EU theory is as much a theory of\nrational choice, or overall preferences amongst acts, as it is a\ntheory of rational belief and desire. This section expands, in turn,\non the epistemological and evaluative commitments of EU theory.\n4.1 On rational belief\n\nSome refer to EU theory as Bayesian decision theory. This\nlabel brings to the forefront the commitment to probabilism,\ni.e., that beliefs may come in degrees which, on pain of\nirrationality, can be represented numerically as probabilities. So\nthere is a strong connection between EU theory and probabilism, or\nmore generally between rational preference and rational belief. (The\nfiner details of rational preference and associated rational belief\nare not the focus here; challenges to EU theory on this front are\naddressed in\n Section 5\n below.)\n\nSome take the connection between rational preference and rational\nbelief to run very deep indeed. At the far end of the spectrum is the\nposition that the very meaning of belief involves preference. Indeed,\nrecall this manoeuvre in Savage\u2019s theory, discussed earlier in\n Section 3.1.\n Many question the plausibility, however, of equating comparative\nbelief with preferences over specially contrived prospects. A more\nmoderate position is to regard these preferences as entailed by, but\nnot identical with, the relevant comparative beliefs. Whether or not\nbeliefs merely ground or are defined in terms of preference, there is\na further question as to whether the only justification for rational\nbelief having a certain structure (say, conforming to the probability\ncalculus) is a pragmatic one, i.e., an argument resting on the\nagent\u2019s preferences being otherwise inconsistent or\nself-defeating. A recent defender of this kind of pragmatism (albeit\ncast in more general terms) is Rinard (e.g., 2017). Others contend\nthat accounts of rational belief can and should be ultimately\njustified on epistemic grounds; Joyce (1998), for instance, offers a\nnon-pragmatic justification of probabilism that rests on the notion of\noverall \u201cdistance from the truth\u201d of one\u2019s beliefs.\n(For further developments of this position, see the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism.)\n\nNotwithstanding these finer disputes, Bayesians agree that pragmatic\nconsiderations play a significant role in managing beliefs. One\nimportant way, at least, in which an agent can interrogate her degrees\nof belief is to reflect on their pragmatic implications. Furthermore,\nwhether or not to seek more evidence is a pragmatic issue; it depends\non the \u201cvalue of information\u201d one expects to gain with\nrespect to the decision problem at hand. The idea is that seeking more\nevidence is an action that is choice-worthy just in case the expected\nutility of seeking further evidence before making one\u2019s decision\nis greater than the expected utility of making the decision on the\nbasis of existing evidence. This reasoning was made prominent in a\npaper by Good (1967), where he proves that one should always seek\n\u201cfree evidence\u201d that may have a bearing on the decision at\nhand. (Precursors of this theorem can be found in Ramsey 1990,\npublished posthumously, and Savage 1954.) Note that the theorem\nassumes the standard Bayesian learning rule known as\n\u201cconditionalisation\u201d, which requires that when one\u2019s\nlearning experience has the form of coming to know some proposition\n(to which one had assigned positive probability) for sure, one\u2019s\nnew degrees of belief should be equal to one\u2019s old degrees of\nbelief conditional on the proposition that now has probability one.\nIndeed, the fact that conditionalisation plays a crucial role in\nGood\u2019s result about the non-negative value of free evidence is\ntaken by some as providing some justification for this learning\nrule.\n\nSo EU theory or Bayesian decision theory underpins a powerful set of\nepistemic norms. It has been taken as the appropriate account of\nscientific inference, giving rise to a school of statistical inference\nand experimental design and inviting formal interpretations of key\nconcepts like \u201cevidence\u201d, \u201cevidential\nsupport\u201d, \u201cinduction\u201d versus\n\u201cabduction\u201d, and the bearing of \u201ccoherence\u201d\nand \u201cexplanatory power\u201d on truth (see the relevant\n related entries).\n The major competitor to Bayesianism, as regards scientific inference,\nis arguably the collection of approaches known as Classical or Error\nstatistics, which deny the sense of \u201cdegrees of support\u201d\n(probabilistic or otherwise) conferred on a hypothesis by evidence.\nThese approaches focus instead on whether a hypothesis has survived\nvarious \u201csevere tests\u201d, and inferences are made with an\neye to the long-run properties of tests as opposed to how they perform\nin any single case, which would require decision-theoretic reasoning\n(see the entry on\n philosophy of statistics).\n4.2 On rational desire\n\nEU theory takes a stance on the structure of rational desire too. In\nthis regard, the theory has been criticised on opposing fronts. We\nconsider first the criticism that EU theory is too permissive with\nrespect to what may influence an agent\u2019s desires. We then turn\nto the opposing criticism: that when it comes to desire, EU theory is\nnot permissive enough.\n\nThe worry that EU theory is too permissive with respect to desire is\nrelated to the worry that the theory is unfalsifiable. The\nworry is that apparently irrational preferences by the lights of EU\ntheory can always be construed as rational, under a suitable\ndescription of the options under consideration. As discussed in\n Section 1\n above, preferences that seem to violate Transitivity can be construed\nas consistent with this axiom so long as the options being compared\nvary in their description depending on, amongst other things, the\nother options under consideration. The same goes for preferences that\nseem to violate Separability or Independence (of the contribution of\neach outcome to the overall value of an option), discussed further in\n Section 5.1\n below. One might argue that this is the right way to describe such\nagents\u2019 preferences. After all, an apt model of preference is\nsupposedly one that captures, in the description of final outcomes and\noptions, everything that matters to an agent. In that case, however,\nEU theory is effectively vacuous or impotent as a standard of\nrationality to which agents can aspire. Moreover, it stretches the\nnotion of what are genuine properties of outcomes that can reasonably\nconfer value or be desirable for an agent.\n\nThere are two ways one can react to the idea that an agent\u2019s\npreferences are necessarily consistent with EU theory, with the\nabove-mentioned implications for what the agent may desire:\n\n\n\nOne can resist the claim, asserting that there are additional\nconstraints on the content of an agent\u2019s preferences.\nOn the one hand there may be empirical constraints whereby the content\nof preferences is determined by some tradeoff between fit and\nsimplicity in representing the agent\u2019s greater \u201cweb\u201d\nof preference attitudes. On the other hand there may be normative\nconstraints with respect to what sorts of outcomes an agent may\nreasonably discriminate (for relevant discussion, see Tversky 1975;\nBroome 1991a & 1993; Pettit 1993; Dreier 1996; Guala 2006;\nVredenburgh 2020).\n\n\nOne can alternatively embrace the claim, interpreting EU theory not as\na standard against which an agent may pass or fail, but rather as an\norganising principle that enables the characterisation of an\nagent\u2019s desires as well as her beliefs (see esp. Guala\n2008).\n\n\nEither way, it may yet be argued that EU theory does not go far enough\nin structuring an agent\u2019s preference attitudes so that we may\nunderstand the reasons for these preference attitudes.\nDietrich and List (2013 & 2016a) have proposed a more general\nframework that fills this lacuna. In their framework, preferences\nsatisfying some minimal constraints are representable as dependent on\nthe bundle of properties in terms of which each option is perceived by\nthe agent in a given context. Properties can, in turn, be categorised\nas either option properties (which are intrinsic to the\noutcome), relational properties (which concern the outcome in\na particular context), or context properties (which concern\nthe context of choice itself). Such a representation permits more\ndetailed analysis of the reasons for an agent\u2019s preferences and\ncaptures different kinds of context-dependence in an agent\u2019s\nchoices. Furthermore, it permits explicit restrictions on what counts\nas a legitimate reason for preference, or in other words, what\nproperties legitimately feature in an outcome description; such\nrestrictions may help to clarify the normative commitments of EU\ntheory.\n\nThere are also less general models that offer templates for\nunderstanding the reasons underlying preferences. For instance, the\nmultiple criteria decision framework (see, for instance,\nKeeney and Raiffa 1993) takes an agent\u2019s overall preference\nordering over options to be an aggregate of the set of preference\norderings corresponding to all the pertinent dimensions of value.\nUnder certain assumptions, the overall or aggregate preference\nordering is compatible with EU theory. One might otherwise seek to\nunderstand the role of time, or the temporal position of goods, on\npreferences. To this end, outcomes are described in terms of\ntemporally-indexed bundles of goods, or consumption streams\n(for an early model of this kind see Ramsey 1928; a later influential\ntreatment is Koopmans 1960). There may be systematic structure to an\nagent's preferences over these consumption streams, over and above the\nstructure imposed by the EU axioms of preference. For instance, the\naforementioned authors considered and characterised preferences that\nexhibit exponential time discounting.\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to the opposing kind of criticism: that the\nlimited constraints that EU theory imposes on rational preference and\ndesire are nonetheless overly restrictive. Here the focus will be on\nthe compatibility of EU theory with prominent ethical positions\nregarding the choice-worthiness of acts, as well as meta-ethical\npositions regarding the nature of value and its relationship to\nbelief.\n\nOne may well wonder whether EU theory, indeed decision theory more\ngenerally, is neutral with respect to normative ethics, or whether it\nis compatible only with ethical consequentialism, given that\nthe ranking of an act is fully determined by the utility of its\npossible outcomes. Such a model seems at odds with\nnonconsequentialist ethical theories for which the\nchoice-worthiness of acts purportedly depends on more than the moral\nvalue of their consequences. The model does not seem able to\naccommodate basic deontological notions like agent relativity,\nabsolute prohibitions or permissible and yet suboptimal acts.\n\nAn initial response, however, is that one should not read too much\ninto the formal concepts of decision theory. The utility measure over\nacts and outcomes is simply a convenient way to represent an ordering,\nand leaves much scope for different ways of identifying and evaluating\noutcomes. Just as an agent\u2019s utility function need not be\ninsensitive to ethical considerations in general (a common\nmisconception due to the prevalence of selfish preferences in economic\nmodels; see, for instance, Sen 1977), nor need it be insensitive to\nspecifically nonconsequentialist or deontological ethical\nconsiderations. It all depends on how acts and their outcomes are\ndistinguished and evaluated. For starters, the character of an act may\nfeature as a property of all its possible outcomes. Moreover, whether\nsome event befalls or is perpetrated by the deciding agent or rather\nsomeone else may be relevant. That an act involves lying, say, can be\nreferenced in all possible outcomes of the act, and furthermore this\nlying on the part of the deciding agent can be distinguished from the\nlying of others. In general, acts and their outcomes can be\ndistinguished according to whatever matters morally, be it a complex\nrelational property to do with how and when the act is chosen, by\nwhom, and/or in what way some state of affairs results from the act.\nFor early discussions on how a wide range of ethical properties can be\naccommodated in the description of acts and outcomes, see, for\ninstance, Sen (1982), Vallentyne (1988), Broome (1991b) and Dreier\n(1993). This idea has since been embraced by others associated with\nthe so-called \u201cconsequentializing\u201d program, including\nLouise (2004) and Portmore (2007). The idea is that the normative\nadvice of putatively nonconsequentialist ethical theories can be\nrepresented in terms of a ranking of acts/outcomes corresponding to\nsome value function, as per consequentialist ethical theories (see too\nColyvan et al. 2010).\n\nA sticking point for reconciling decision theory with all forms of\nnonconsequentialism is the difficulty in accommodating absolute\nprohibitions or side constraints (see Oddie and Milne\n1999; Jackson and Smith 2006). For instance, suppose there is a moral\nprohibition against killing an innocent person, whatever else is at\nstake. Perhaps such a constraint is best modelled in terms of a\nlexical ranking and corresponding value function, whereby the\nkilling-innocents status of an act/outcome takes priority in\ndetermining its relative rank/value. But this has counterintuitive\nimplications in the face of risk since very many acts will have some\nchance, however small, of killing an innocent. The lesson here may\nsimply be that the theories in question require development; any\nmature ethical theory owes us an account of how to act under risk or\nuncertainty. What is arguably a more compelling challenge for the\nreconciliation of decision theory and nonconsequentialism is the\naccommodation of \u201cagent-centred options\u201d and associated\n\u201csupererogation\u201d. Portmore (e.g., 2007) and Lazar (e.g.,\n2017) offer proposals to this effect, which appeal (in different ways)\nto the moral ranking of acts/outcomes as distinct from the personal\ncosts to the agent of pursuing these acts/outcomes.\n\nTo the extent that decision theory can be reconciled with the full\nrange of ethical theories, should we say that there are no meaningful\ndistinctions between these theories? Brown (2011) and Dietrich and\nList (2017) demonstrate that in fact the choice-theoretic\nrepresentation of ethical theories better facilitates distinctions\nbetween them; terms like \u201c(non)consequentialism\u201d can be\nprecisely defined, albeit in debatable ways. More generally, we can\ncatalogue theories in terms of the kinds of properties (whether\nintrinsic or in some sense relational) that distinguish acts/outcomes\nand also in terms of the nature of the ranking of acts/outcomes that\nthey yield (whether transitive, complete, continuous and so on). This\nalso serves to reveal departures from EU theory.\n\nIndeed, some of the most compelling counterexamples to EU axioms of\npreference rest on ethical considerations. Recall our earlier\ndiscussion of the basic Ordering axioms in\n Section 1.\n The Transitivity axiom has been challenged by appeal to\nethically-motivated examples of preference cycles (see Temkin 2012).\nThe notion of a non-continuous lexical ordering was mentioned above in\nrelation to ethical side constraints. The dispensability of the\nCompleteness axiom, too, is often motivated by appeal to examples\ninvolving competing ethical values that are difficult to tradeoff\nagainst each other, like average versus total welfare. Other\nsuggestive examples against Completeness involve competing notions of\npersonal welfare (see, e.g., Levi 1986; Chang 2002). Must a rational\nagent have a defined preference between, say, two career options that\npull in different directions as regards opportunities for creative\nself-expression versus community service (perhaps a career as a dancer\nversus a career as a doctor in remote regions)? Note that some of\nthese challenges to EU theory are discussed in more depth in\n Section 5\n below.\n\nFinally, we turn to the potential meta-ethical commitments of EU\ntheory. David Lewis (1988, 1996) famously employed EU theory to argue\nagainst anti-Humeanism, the position that we are sometimes\nmoved entirely by our beliefs about what would be good, rather than by\nour desires as the Humean claims. He formulated the anti-Humean theory\nas postulating a necessary connection between, on the one hand, an\nagent\u2019s desire for any proposition \\(A\\), and, on the other\nhand, her belief in a proposition about \\(A\\)\u2019s goodness; and\nclaimed to prove that when such a connection is formulated in terms of\nEU theory, the agent in question will be dynamically incoherent.\nSeveral people have criticised Lewis\u2019s argument. For instance,\nBroome (1991c), Byrne and H\u00e1jek (1997) and H\u00e1jek and\nPettit (2004) suggest formulations of anti-Humeanism that are immune\nto Lewis\u2019 criticism, while Stef\u00e1nsson (2014) and Bradley\nand Stef\u00e1nsson (2016) argue that Lewis\u2019 proof relies on a\nfalse assumption. Nevertheless, Lewis\u2019 argument no doubt\nprovoked an interesting debate about the sorts of connections between\nbelief and desire that EU theory permits. There are, moreover, further\nquestions of meta-ethical relevance that one might investigate\nregarding the role and structure of desire in EU theory. For instance,\nJeffrey (1974) and Sen (1977) offer some preliminary investigations as\nto whether the theory can accommodate higher-order\ndesires/preferences, and if so, how these relate to first-order\ndesires/preferences.\n5. Challenges to EU theory\n\nThus far the focus has been on prominent versions of the standard\ntheory of rational choice: EU theory. This section picks up on some\nkey criticisms of EU theory that have been developed into alternative\naccounts of rational choice. The proposed innovations to the standard\ntheory are distinct and so are discussed separately, but they are not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive. Note that we do not address all\ncriticisms of EU theory that have inspired alternative accounts of\nrational choice. Two major omissions of this sort (for want of space\nand also because they have been thoroughly addressed in alternative\nentries of this encyclopedia) are i) the problem of causal anomalies\nand the development of causal decision theory (see the entry on\n causal decision theory),\n and ii) the problem of infinite state spaces and the development of\nalternatives like \u201crelative expectation theory\u201d (see the\nentries on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility theory\n and\n the St. Petersburg paradox).\n5.1 On risk and regret attitudes\n\nExpected utility theory has been criticised for not allowing for value\ninteractions between outcomes in different, mutually incompatible\nstates of the world. For instance, recall that when deciding between\ntwo risky options you should, according to Savage\u2019s version of\nthe theory, ignore the states of the world where the two options\nresult in the same outcome. That seems very reasonable if we can\nassume separability between outcomes in different states of\nthe world, i.e., if the contribution that an outcome in one state of\nthe world makes towards the overall value of an option is independent\nof what other outcomes the option might result in. For then identical\noutcomes (with equal probabilities) should cancel each other out in a\ncomparison of two options, which would entail that if two options\nshare an outcome in some state of the world, then when comparing the\noptions, it does not matter what that shared outcome is.\n\nThe Allais paradox, discussed in\n Section 2.3\n above, is a classic example where the aforementioned separability\nseems to fail. For ease of reference, the options that generate the\nparadox are reproduced as Table 3. Recall from\n Section 2.3\n that people tend to prefer \\(L_2\\) over \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_3\\) over\n\\(L_4\\)\u2014an attitude that has been called Allais\u2019\npreferences\u2014in violation of expected utility theory. The\nviolation occurs precisely because the contributions that some of\nthese outcomes make towards the overall value of an option is not\nindependent of the other outcomes that the option can have. Compare\nthe extra chance of outcome $0 that \\(L_1\\) has over \\(L_2\\) with the\nsame extra chance of $0 that \\(L_3\\) has over \\(L_4\\). Many people\nthink that this extra chance counts more heavily in the first\ncomparison than the latter, i.e., that an extra 0.01 chance of $0\ncontributes a greater negative value to \\(L_1\\) than to \\(L_3\\). Some\nexplain this by pointing out that the regret one would\nexperience by winning nothing when one could have had $2400 for\nsure\u2014i.e., when choosing \\(L_1\\) over \\(L_2\\) and the first\nticket is drawn\u2014is much greater than the regret one would\nexperience by winning nothing when the option one turned down also had\na high chance of resulting in $0\u2014such as when choosing \\(L_3\\)\nover \\(L_4\\) (see, e.g., Loomes and Sugden 1982). But whether or not\nthe preference in question should be explained by the potential for\nregret, it would seem that the desirability of the $0-outcome depends\non what could (or would) otherwise have been; in violation of the\naforementioned assumption of separability. (See Thoma 2020a for a\nrecent extensive discussion of this assumption.) \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_1\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$2400 \n\n\\(L_2\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$2400 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_3\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$0 \n\n\\(L_4\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$0 \n\n\nTable 3. Allais\u2019 paradox\n\n\nVarious attempts have been made to make Allais\u2019 preferences\ncompatible with some version of expected utility theory. A common\nresponse is to suggest that the choice problem has been incorrectly\ndescribed. If it really is rational to evaluate $0 differently\ndepending on which lottery it is part of, then perhaps this should be\naccounted for in the description of the outcomes (Broome 1991a). For\ninstance, we could add a variable to the $0 outcome that \\(L_1\\) might\nresult in to represent the extra regret or risk associate with that\noutcome compared to the $0 outcomes from the other lotteries (as done\nin\n Table 4).\n If we do that, Allais\u2019 preferences are no longer inconsistent\nwith EU theory. The simplest way to see this is to note that when we\nignore the state of the world where the options that are being\ncompared have the same outcome (i.e., when we ignore the last column\nin Table 4), \\(L_1\\) is no longer identical to \\(L_3\\), which means\nthat the Independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgenstern (and\nSavage\u2019s Sure Thing Principle) no longer requires that one\nprefer \\(L_2\\) over \\(L_1\\) only if one prefers \\(L_4\\) over\n\\(L_3\\).\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_1\\)\n$0 + \\(\\delta\\)\n$2500\n$2400 \n\n\\(L_2\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$2400 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_3\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$0 \n\n\\(L_4\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$0 \n\n\nTable 4. Allais\u2019 paradox\nre-described\n\n\nThe above \u201cre-description strategy\u201d could be employed\nwhenever the value and/or contribution of an outcome depends on other\npossible outcomes: just describe the outcomes in a way that accounts\nfor this dependency. But more worryingly, the strategy could be\nemployed whenever one comes across any violation of expected\nutility theory or other theories of rationality (as discussed in\n Section 4.2).\n \n\nLara Buchak (2013) has recently developed a decision theory that can\naccommodate Allais\u2019 preferences without re-describing the\noutcomes. On Buchak\u2019s interpretation, the explanation for\nAllais\u2019 preferences is not the different value that the\noutcome $0 has depending on what lottery it is part of. The outcome\nitself has the same value. However, the contribution that $0\nmakes towards the overall value of an option partly depends on what\nother outcomes are possible, she suggests, which reflects the fact\nthat the option-risk that the possibility of $0 generates depends on\nwhat other outcomes the option might result in. To accommodate\nAllais\u2019 preferences (and other intuitively rational attitudes to\nrisk that violate EU theory), Buchak introduces a risk\nfunction that represents people\u2019s willingness to trade\nchances of something good for risks of something bad. And she shows\nthat if an agent satisfies a particular set of axioms, which is\nessentially Savage\u2019s except that the Sure Thing Principle is\nreplaced with a strictly weaker one, then the agent\u2019s\npreferences can be represented as maximising risk weighted\nexpected utility; which is essentially Savage-style expected\nutility weighted by a risk function.\n\nBradley and Stef\u00e1nsson (2017) also develop a new decision\ntheory partly in response to the Allais paradox. But unlike Buchak,\nthey suggest that what explains Allais\u2019 preferences is that the\nvalue of wining nothing from a chosen lottery partly depends on what\nwould have happened had one chosen differently. To accommodate this,\nthey extend the Boolean algebra in Jeffrey\u2019s decision theory to\ncounterfactual propositions, and show that Jeffrey\u2019s\nextended theory can represent the value-dependencies one often finds\nbetween counterfactual and actual outcomes. In particular, their\ntheory can capture the intuition that the (un)desirability of winning\nnothing partly depends on whether or not one was guaranteed to win\nsomething had one chosen differently. Therefore, their theory can\nrepresent Allais\u2019 preferences as maximising the value of an\nextended Jeffrey-desirability function.\n\nStef\u00e1nsson and Bradley (2019) suggest yet another way of\naccounting for Allais\u2019 preferences in an extension of\nJeffrey\u2019s decision theory; this time extended to chance\npropositions, that is, propositions describing objective\nprobability distributions. The general idea is that the desirability\nof a particular increase or decrease in the chance of some\noutcome\u2014for instance, in the Allais case, a 0.01 increase in the\nchance of the $0-outcome\u2014might depend on what the chances were\nbefore the increase or decrease. Stef\u00e1nsson and Bradley\u2019s\nextension of Jeffrey\u2019s theory to chance propositions is also\nmotivated by the fact that standard decision theories do not\ndistinguish between risk aversion with respect to some good and\nattitudes to quantities of that good (which is found problematic by,\nfor instance, Hansson 1988, Rabin 2000, and Buchak 2013).\n5.2 On completeness: Vague beliefs and desires\n\nAs noted in\n Section 4,\n criticisms of the EU requirement of a complete preference ordering\nare motivated by both epistemic and desire/value considerations. On\nthe value side, many contend that a rational agent may simply find two\noptions incomparable due to their incommensurable\nqualities. (Here a prominent usage of these terms will be followed,\nwhereby particular options may be described as incomparable in value,\nwhile general properties or dimensions of value may be described as\nincommensurable.) As in, the agent\u2019s evaluations of the\ndesirability of sure options may not be representable by any precise\nutility function. Likewise, on the belief side, some contend (notably,\nJoyce 2010 and Bradley 2017) that the evidence may be such that it\ndoes not commit a rational agent to precise degrees of belief\nmeasurable by a unique probability function.\n\nThere are various alternative, \u201cfuzzier\u201d representations\nof desire and belief that might be deemed more suitable. Halpern\n(2003), for instance, investigates different ways of conceptualising\nand representing epistemic uncertainty, once we depart from\nprobabilities. Presumably there are also various ways to represent\nuncertain desire. Here the focus will be on just one proposal that is\npopular amongst philosophers: the use of sets of probability\nand utility functions to represent uncertainty in belief and desire\nrespectively. This is a minimal generalisation of the standard EU\nmodel, in the sense that probability and utility measures still\nfeature. Roughly, the more severe the epistemic uncertainty, the more\nprobability measures over the space of possibilities needed to\nconjointly represent the agent\u2019s beliefs. This notion of\nrational belief is referred to as imprecise probabilism (see\nthe entry on\n imprecise probabilities).\n Likewise, the more severe the evaluative uncertainty, the more\nutility measures over the space of sure options needed to conjointly\nrepresent the agent\u2019s desires. Strictly speaking, we should not\ntreat belief and desire separately, but rather talk of the\nagent\u2019s incomplete preferences being represented by a set of\nprobability and utility pairs. Recall the requirement that incomplete\npreferences be coherently extendible (refer back to\n Section 1);\n on this representation, all the probability-utility pairs amount to\ncandidate extensions of the incomplete preferences.\n\nThe question then arises: Is there a conservative generalisation of\nthe EU decision rule that can handle sets of probability and utility\npairs? Contender decision rules are standardly framed in terms of\nchoice functions that take as input some set of feasible options and\nreturn as output a non-empty set of admissible choices that is a\nsubset of the feasible options. A basic constraint on these choice\nfunctions is that they respect the agent\u2019s preferences in cases\nwhere options are in fact comparable. That is, if all pairs of\nprobability and utility functions characterising the agent\u2019s\nattitudes agree on the ranking of two options, then these particular\noptions should be ranked accordingly. The relevant constraint on\nchoice functions is that \u201cEU-dominated options\u201d are not\nadmissible choices, i.e., if an option has lower expected utility than\nanother option according to all pairs of probability and utility\nfunctions, then the former dominated option is not an admissible\nchoice. Note that Levi (1986) has a slightly more restrictive\ncondition on admissibility: if an option does not have maximum EU for\nat least one pair of probability and utility functions, then it is not\nadmissible. In ordinary cases where sets of probability and utility\nfunctions are closed convex sets, however, Levi\u2019s condition is\nequivalent to the aforementioned one that rules out EU-dominated\noptions (Schervish et al. 2003).\n\nThe treatment of genuinely incomparable options (those surviving the\nabove admissibility test and yet are not such that the agent is\nindifferent) is where the real controversies begin. See Bradley (2017)\nfor extensive discussion of the various ways to proceed. A\nconsideration that is often appealed to in order to discriminate\nbetween incomparable options is caution. The Maxmin-EU rule, for\ninstance, recommends picking the action with greatest minimum expected\nutility (see Gilboa and Schmeidler 1989; Walley 1991). The rule is\nsimple to use, but arguably much too cautious, paying no attention at\nall to the full spread of expected utilities. The \\(\\alpha\\)-Maxmin\nrule, by contrast, recommends taking the action with the greatest\n\\(\\alpha\\)-weighted sum of the minimum and maximum expected utilities\nassociated with it. The relative weights for the minimum and maximum\nexpected utilities can be thought of as reflecting either the decision\nmaker\u2019s pessimism in the face of uncertainty or else her degree\nof caution (see Binmore 2009).\n\nThere are more complicated choice rules that depend on a richer\nrepresentation of uncertainty involving a notion of\nconfidence. For instance, Klibanoff et al. (2005) propose a\nrule whereby choices are made between otherwise incomparable options\non the basis of confidence-weighted expected utility. It presupposes\nthat weights can be assigned to the various expected utilities\nassociated with an act, reflecting the agent\u2019s confidence in the\ncorresponding probability and utility pairs. There are alternative\nrules that appeal to confidence even in the absence of precise\ncardinal weights. G\u00e4rdenfors and Sahlin (1982), for instance,\nsuggest simply excluding from consideration any probability (and\nutility) functions that fall below a confidence threshold, and then\napplying the Maxmin-EU rule based on the remainder. Hill\u2019s\n(2013) choice theory is somewhat similar, although confidence\nthresholds for probability and utility pairs are allowed to vary\ndepending on the choice problem (and the term \u201cconfidence\u201d\nis itself used differently). There are further proposals whereby acts\nare compared in terms of how much uncertainty they can tolerate (which\nagain depends on levels of confidence) and yet still be a satisfactory\noption (see, e.g., Ben-Haim 2001). These rules are compelling, but\nthey do raise a host of difficult questions regarding how to interpret\nand measure the extra subjective attitudes that play a role, like\n\u201camount of confidence in a belief/desire\u201d and\n\u201csatisfactory level of desirability\u201d.\n5.3 Unawareness\n\nThere has been recent interest in yet a further challenge to expected\nutility theory, namely, the challenge from unawareness. In\nfact, unawareness presents a challenge for all extant normative\ntheories of choice. To keep things simple, we shall however focus on\nSavage\u2019s expected utility theory to illustrate the challenge\nposed by unawareness.\n\nAs the reader will recall, Savage takes for granted a set of possible\noutcomes \\(\\bO\\), and another set of possible states of the world\n\\(\\bS\\), and defines the set of acts, \\(\\bF\\), as the set of all\nfunctions from \\(\\bS\\) to \\(\\bO\\). Moreover, his representation\ntheorem has been interpreted as justifying the claim that a rational\nperson always performs the act in \\(\\bF\\) that maximises expected\nutility, relative to a probability measure over \\(\\bS\\) and a utility\nmeasure over \\(\\bO\\). \n\nNow, Savage\u2019s theory is neutral about how to interpret the\nstates in \\(\\bS\\) and the outcomes in \\(\\bO\\). For instance, the\ntheory is consistent with interpreting \\(\\bS\\) and \\(\\bO\\) as\nrespectively the sets of all logically possible states and\noutcomes, but it is also consistent with interpreting \\(\\bS\\) and\n\\(\\bO\\) as respectively the sets of states and outcomes that some\nmodeller recognises, or the sets of states and outcomes that\nthe decision-maker herself recognises. \n\nIf the theory is meant to describe the reasoning of a decision-maker,\nthe first two interpretations would seem inferior to the third. The\nproblem with the first two interpretations is that the decision-maker\nmight be unaware of some of the logically possible states and\noutcomes, as well as some of the states and outcomes that the modeller\nis aware of. (Having said that, one may identify the states and\noutcomes that the agent is unaware of by reference to those of which\nthe modeller is aware.)\n\nWhen it comes to (partially) unaware decision-makers, an important\ndistinction can be made between on the one hand what we might call\n\u201cunawareness of unawareness\u201d\u2014that is, a situation\nwhere a decision-maker does not realise that there might be some\noutcome or state that they are unaware of\u2014and on the other hand\n\u201cawareness of unawareness\u201d\u2014that is, a situation\nwhere a decision-maker at least suspects that there is some outcome or\nstate of which they are unaware. \n\nFrom the perspective of decision-making, unawareness of unawareness is\nnot of much interest. After all, if one is not even aware of the\npossibility that one is unaware of some state or outcome, then that\nunawareness cannot play any role in one\u2019s reasoning about what\nto do. However, decision-theoretic models have been proposed for how a\nrational person responds to growth in awareness (that is\nmeant to apply even to people who previously were unaware of their\nunawareness). In particular, economists Karni and Vier\u00f8 (2013,\n2015) have recently extended standard Bayesian conditionalisation to\nsuch learning events. Their theory, Reverse Bayesianism,\ninformally says that awareness growth should not affect the ratios of\nprobabilities of the states/outcomes that the agent was aware of\nbefore the growth. Richard Bradley (2017) defends a similar principle\nin the context of the more general Jeffrey-style framework, and so\ndoes Roussos (2020); but the view is criticised by Steele and\nStef\u00e1nsson (forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b) and by Mahtani\n(forthcoming).\n\nIn contrast, awareness of unawareness would seem to be of great\ninterest from the perspective of decision-making. If you suspect that\nthere is some possible state, say, that you have not yet entertained,\nand some corresponding outcome, the content of which you are unaware,\nthen you might want to at least come to some view about how likely you\nexpect this state to be, and how good or bad you expect the\ncorresponding outcome to be, before you make a decision.\n\nA number of people have suggested models to represent agents who are\naware of their unawareness (e.g., Walker & Dietz 2013, Piermont\n2017, Karni & Vier\u00f8 2017). Steele and Stef\u00e1nsson\n(forthcoming-b) argue that there may not be anything especially\ndistinctive about how a decision-maker reasons about states/outcomes\nof which she is aware she is unaware, in terms of the confidence she\nhas in her judgments and how she manages risk. That said, the way she\narrives at such judgments of probability and desirability is worth\nexploring further. Grant and Quiggin (2013a, 2013b), for instance,\nsuggest that these judgments are made based on induction from past\nsituations where one experienced awareness growth.\n\nIn general, the literature on unawareness has been rapidly growing.\nBradley (2017) and Steele and Stef\u00e1nsson (forthcoming-b) are\nnew in-depth treatments of this topic within philosophy. Schipper\nmaintains a bibliography on unawareness, mostly with papers in\neconomics and computer science, at\n\\url{http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/unaw.htm}. \n6. Sequential decisions\n\nThe decision theories of Savage and Jeffrey, as well as those of their\ncritics, apparently concern a single or \u201cone shot only\u201d\ndecision; at issue is an agent\u2019s preference ordering, and\nultimately her choice of act, at a particular point in time. One may\nrefer to this as a static decision problem. The question\narises as to whether this framework is adequate for handling more\ncomplex scenarios, in particular those involving a series or sequence\nof decisions; these are referred to as sequential decision\nproblems.\n\nOn paper, at least, static and sequential decision models look very\ndifferent. The static model has familiar tabular or normal\nform, with each row representing an available act/option, and columns\nrepresenting the different possible states of the world that yield a\ngiven outcome for each act. The sequential decision model, on the\nother hand, has tree or extensive form (such as in\n Figure 1).\n It depicts a series of anticipated choice points, where the branches\nextending from a choice point represent the options at that choice\npoint. Some of these branches lead to further choice points, often\nafter the resolution of some uncertainty due to new evidence.\n\nThese basic differences between static and sequential decision models\nraise questions about how, in fact, they relate to each other:\n\n\n\nDo static and sequential decision models depict the same kind of\ndecision problem? If so, what is the static counterpart of a\nsequential decision model?\n\n\nDoes the sequential decision setting reveal any further\n(dis)advantages of EU theory? More generally does this setting shed\nlight on normative theories of choice?\n\n\nThese questions turn out to be rather controversial. They will be\naddressed in turn, after the scene has been set with an old story\nabout Ulysses.\n6.1 Was Ulysses rational? \n\nA well-known sequential decision problem is the one facing Ulysses on\nhis journey home to Ithaca in Homer\u2019s great tale from antiquity.\nUlysses must make a choice about the manner in which he will sail past\nan island inhabited by sweet-singing sirens. He can choose to sail\nunrestrained or else tied to the mast. In the former case, Ulysses\nwill later have the choice, upon hearing the sirens, to either\ncontinue sailing home to Ithaca or to stay on the island indefinitely.\nIn the latter case, he will not be free to make further choices and\nthe ship will sail onwards to Ithaca past the sweet-singing sirens.\nThe final outcome depends on what sequence of choices Ulysses makes.\nUlysses\u2019 decision problem is represented in tree (or extensive)\nform in\n Figure 1\n (where the two boxes represent choice points for Ulysses).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ulysses\u2019 decision\nproblem\n\n\nWe are told that, before embarking, Ulysses would most prefer to\nfreely hear the sirens and return home to Ithaca. The problem is that\nUlysses predicts his future self will not comply: if he sails\nunrestrained, he will later be seduced by the sirens and will not in\nfact continue home to Ithaca but will rather remain on the island\nindefinitely. Ulysses therefore reasons that it would be better to be\ntied to the mast, because he would prefer the shame and discomfort of\nbeing tied to the mast and making it home to remaining on the\nsirens\u2019 island forever.\n\nIt is hard to deny that Ulysses makes a wise choice in being tied to\nthe mast. Some hold, however, that Ulysses is nevertheless not an\nexemplary agent, since his present self must play against his future\nself who will be unwittingly seduced by the sirens. While Ulysses is\nrational at the first choice node by static decision\nstandards, we might regard him irrational overall by\nsequential decision standards, understood in terms of the relative\nvalue of sequences of choices. The sequence of choices that Ulysses\ninevitably pursues is, after all, suboptimal. It would have been\nbetter were he able to sail unconstrained and continue on home to\nIthaca. This sequence could have been achieved if Ulysses were\ncontinuously rational over the extended time period; say, if\nat all times he were to act as an EU maximiser, and change his beliefs\nand desires only in accordance with Bayesian norms (variants of\nstandard conditionalisation). On this reading, sequential\ndecision models introduce considerations of rationality-over-time.\n\nWhile rationality-over-time may have import in assessing an\nagent\u2019s preferences and norms for changing these preferences\n(one can read the discussion in\n Section 6.2\n below in this way), there remains the important question of how an\nagent should act in light of her preferences at any given point in\ntime. To this end, the sequential decision model can be\nfruitfully viewed as a tool for helping determine rational choice at a\nparticular time, just like the static decision model. The sequential\ndecision tree is effectively a way of visualising the temporal series\nof choices and learning events that an agent believes she\nwill confront in the future, depending on what part of the decision\ntree she will find herself. The key question, then, is: How should an\nagent choose amongst her initial options in light of her projected\ndecision tree? This question has generated a surprising amount of\ncontroversy. Three major approaches to negotiating sequential decision\ntrees have appeared in the literature. These are the\nna\u00efve or myopic approach, the\nsophisticated approach and the resolute approach.\nThese will be discussed in turn; it will be suggested that the\ndisputes may not be substantial but rather indicate subtle differences\nin the interpretation of sequential decision models.\n\nThe so-called na\u00efve approach to negotiating sequential decisions\nserves as a useful contrast to the other two approaches. The\nna\u00efve agent assumes that any path through the decision tree is\npossible, and so sets off on whichever path is optimal, given his/her\npresent attitudes. For instance, a na\u00efve Ulysses would simply\npresume that he has three overall strategies to choose from: either\nordering the crew to tie him to the mast, or issuing no such order and\nlater stopping at the sirens\u2019 island, or issuing no such order\nand later sticking to his course. Ulysses prefers the outcome\nassociated with the latter combination, and so he initiates this\nstrategy by not ordering the crew to restrain him. Table 5 presents\nthe static counterpart of na\u00efve Ulysses\u2019 decision problem.\nIn effect, this decision model does not take into account\nUlysses\u2019 present knowledge of his future preferences, and hence\nadvises that he pursue an option that is predicted to be\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nAct\nOutcome\n\norder tying to mast\nreach home, some humiliation\n\nsail unconstrained then stay with sirens \nlife with sirens\n\nsail unconstrained then home to Ithaca \nreach home, no humiliation\n\n\nTable 5. Na\u00efve Ulysses\u2019\ndecision problem\n\n\nThere is no need to labour the point that the na\u00efve approach to\nsequential choice is aptly named. The hallmark of the sophisticated\napproach, by contrast, is its emphasis on backwards planning: the\nsophisticated chooser does not assume that all paths through the\ndecision tree, or in other words, all possible combinations of choices\nat the various choice nodes, will be possible. The agent considers,\nrather, what he/she will be inclined to choose at later choice nodes\nwhen he/she gets to the temporal position in question. Sophisticated\nUlysses would take note of the fact that, if he reaches the island of\nthe sirens unrestrained, he will want to stop there indefinitely, due\nto the transformative effect of the sirens\u2019 song on his\npreferences. This is then reflected in the static representation of\nthe decision problem, as per Table 6. The states here concern\nUlysses\u2019 future preferences, once he reaches the island. Since\nthe second state has (by assumption) probability zero, the acts are\ndecided on the basis of the first state, so Ulysses wisely chooses to\nbe tied to the mast.\n\n\n\nAct\nlater choose sirens \\( (p = 1)\\)\nlater choose Ithaca \\( (p = 0)\\)\n\norder tying to mast \nhome, some humiliation \nhome, some humiliation\n\nsail unconstrained \nlife with sirens \nhome, no humiliation\n\n\nTable 6. Sophisticated Ulysses\u2019\ndecision problem\n\n\nResolute choice deviates from sophisticated choice only under certain\nconditions that are not fulfilled by Ulysses, given his inexplicable\nchange in attitudes. Defenders of resolute choice typically defend\ndecision theories and associated preferences that violate the\nIndependence axiom/Sure-Thing Principle (notably McClennen 1990 and\nMachina 1989; see also Rabinowicz 1995 and Buchak 2013 for\ndiscussion), and appeal to resolute choice to make these preferences\nmore palatable in the sequential-decision context (to be discussed\nfurther in\n Section 6.2\n below). According to resolute choice, in appropriate contexts, the\nagent should at all choice points stick to the strategy that was\ninitially deemed best. The question is whether this advice makes\nsense, given the standard interpretation of a sequential decision\nmodel. What would it mean for an agent to choose against her\npreferences in order to fulfill a previously-selected plan? That would\nseem to defy the very notion of preference. Of course, an agent may\nplace considerable importance on honouring previous commitments. Any\nsuch integrity concerns, however, should arguably be reflected in the\nspecification of outcomes and thus in the agent\u2019s preferences at\nthe time in question. This is quite different from choosing out of\nstep with one\u2019s all-things-considered preferences at a time.\n\nDefenders of resolute choice may have in mind a different\ninterpretation of sequential decision models, whereby future\n\u201cchoice points\u201d are not really points at which an agent is\nfree to choose according to her preferences at the time. If so, this\nwould amount to a subtle shift in the question or problem of interest.\nIn what follows, the standard interpretation of sequential decision\nmodels will be assumed, and accordingly, it will be assumed that\nrational agents pursue the sophisticated approach to choice (as per\nLevi 1991, Maher 1992, Seidenfeld 1994, amongst others).\n6.2 The EU axioms revisited\n\nWe have seen that sequential decision trees can help an agent like\nUlysses take stock of the consequences of his current choice, so that\nhe can better reflect on what to do now. The literature on\nsequential choice is primarily concerned, however, with more ambitious\nquestions. The sequential-decision setting effectively offers new ways\nto \u201ctest\u201d theories of rational preference and norms for\npreference (or belief and desire) change. The question is whether an\nagent\u2019s decision theory in this broad sense is shown to be\ndynamically inconsistent or self-defeating.\n\nSkyrms\u2019 (1993) \u201cdiachronic Dutch book\u201d argument for\nconditionalisation can be read in this way. The agent is assumed to\nhave EU preferences and to take a sophisticated (backwards reasoning)\napproach to sequential decision problems. Skyrms shows that any such\nagent who plans to learn in a manner at odds with conditionalisation\nwill make self-defeating choices in some specially contrived\nsequential decision situations. A conditionalising agent, by contrast,\nwill never make choices that are self-defeating in this way. The kind\nof \u201cself-defeating choices\u201d at issue here are ones that\nyield a sure loss. That is, the agent chooses a strategy that is\nsurely worse, by her own lights, than another strategy that she might\notherwise have chosen, if only her learning rule was such that she\nwould choose differently at one or more future decision nodes.\n\nA similar \u201cdynamic consistency\u201d argument can be used to\ndefend EU preferences in addition to learning in accordance with\nconditionalisation (see Hammond 1976, 1977, 1988b,c). It is assumed,\nas before, that the agent takes a sophisticated approach to sequential\ndecision problems. Hammond shows that only a fully Bayesian agent can\nplan to pursue any path in a sequential decision tree that is deemed\noptimal at the initial choice node. This makes the Bayesian agent\nunique in that she will never make \u201cself-defeating\nchoices\u201d on account of her preferences and norms for preference\nchange. She will never choose a strategy that is worse by her own\nlights than another strategy that she might otherwise have chosen, if\nonly her preferences were such that she would choose differently at\none or more future decision nodes.\n\nHammond\u2019s argument for EU theory, and the notion of dynamic\nconsistency that it invokes, has been criticised from different\nquarters, both by those who defend theories that violate the\nIndependence axiom but retain the Completeness and Transitivity (i.e.,\nOrdering) axioms of EU theory, and those who defend theories that\nviolate the latter (for discussion, see Steele 2010). The approach\ntaken by some defenders of Independence-violating theories (notably,\nMachina 1989 and McClennen 1990) has already been alluded to: They\nreject the assumption of sophisticated choice underpinning the dynamic\nconsistency arguments. Seidenfeld (1988a,b, 1994, 2000a,b) rather\nrejects Hammond\u2019s notion of dynamic consistency in favour of a\nmore subtle notion that discriminates between theories that violate\nOrdering and those that violate Independence alone; the former, unlike\nthe latter, pass Seidenfeld\u2019s test that turns on future decision\nnodes where the agent is indifferent between the best options. This\nargument too is not without its critics (see McClennen 1988, Hammond\n1988a, Rabinowicz 2000).\n\nNote that the costs of any departure from EU theory are well\nhighlighted by Al-Najjar and Weinstein (2009), in particular the\npossibility of aversion to free information and aversion to\nopportunities for greater choice in the future. Kadane et al. (2008)\nand Bradley and Steele (2016) focus on the sure loss that is\nassociated with paying to avoid free evidence. But see Buchak (2010,\n2013) for nuanced discussion of this issue in relation to epistemic\nversus instrumental rationality.\n7. Concluding remarks\n\nLet us conclude by summarising the main reasons why decision theory,\nas described above, is of philosophical interest. First, normative\ndecision theory is clearly a (minimal) theory of practical\nrationality. The aim is to characterise the attitudes of agents who\nare practically rational, and various (static and sequential)\narguments are typically made to show that certain practical\ncatastrophes befall agents who do not satisfy standard\ndecision-theoretic constraints. Second, many of these constraints\nconcern the agents\u2019 beliefs. In particular, normative\ndecision theory requires that agents\u2019 degrees of beliefs satisfy\nthe probability axioms and that they respond to new information by\nconditionalisation. Therefore, decision theory has great implications\nfor debates in epistemology and philosophy of science; that is, for\ntheories of epistemic rationality.\n\nFinally, decision theory should be of great interest to philosophers\nof mind and psychology, and others who are interested in how people\ncan understand the behaviour and intentions of others; and, more\ngenerally, how we can interpret what goes on in other people\u2019s\nminds. Decision theorists typically assume that a person\u2019s\nbehaviour can be fully explained in terms of her beliefs and desires.\nBut perhaps more interestingly, some of the most important results of\ndecision theory\u2014the various representation theorems, some of\nwhich have discussed here\u2014suggest that if a person satisfies\ncertain rationality requirements, then we can read her beliefs and\ndesires, and how strong these beliefs and desires are, from her choice\ndispositions (or preferences). How much these theorems really tell us\nis a matter of debate, as discussed above. But on an optimistic\nreading of these results, they assure us that we can meaningfully talk\nabout what goes on in other people\u2019s minds without much evidence\nbeyond information about their dispositions to choose.",
