    "main_text": "Kant, Schiller and Hegel on Beauty and Freedom\n4. Kant, Schiller and Hegel on Beauty and Freedom\n\n\nHegel\u2019s close association of art with beauty and freedom shows\nhis clear indebtedness to Kant and Schiller. Kant also maintained that\nour experience of beauty is an experience of freedom. He argued,\nhowever, that beauty is not itself an objective property of things.\nWhen we judge that a natural object or a work of art is beautiful, on\nKant\u2019s view, we are indeed making a judgment about an object, but\nwe are asserting that the object has a certain effect on us\n(and that it should have the same effect on all who view it). The\neffect produced by the \u201cbeautiful\u201d object is to set our\nunderstanding and imagination in \u201cfree play\u201d with one\nanother, and it is the pleasure generated by this free play that leads\nus to judge the object to be beautiful (Kant, 98, 102\u20133).\n\n\nIn contrast to Kant, Schiller understands beauty to be a property of\nthe object itself. It is the property, possessed by both living beings\nand works of art, of appearing to be free when in fact they are not. As\nSchiller puts it in the \u201cKallias\u201d letters, beauty is\n\u201cfreedom in appearance, autonomy in appearance\u201d (Schiller,\n151). Schiller insists that freedom itself is something\n\u201cnoumenal\u201d (to use Kant\u2019s terminology) and so can\nnever actually manifest itself in the realm of the senses. We can never\nsee freedom at work in, or embodied in, the world of space and time. In\nthe case of beautiful objects, therefore\u2014whether they are the\nproducts of nature or human imagination\u2014\u201cit is all that\nmatters [ \u2026 ] that the object appears as free, not that\nit really is so\u201d (Schiller, 151).\n\n\nHegel agrees with Schiller (against Kant) that beauty is an objective\nproperty of things. In his view, however, beauty is the direct sensuous\nmanifestation of freedom, not merely the appearance or\nimitation of freedom. It shows us what freedom actually looks like and\nsounds like when it gives itself sensuous expression (albeit with\nvarying degrees of idealization). Since true beauty is the direct\nsensuous expression of the freedom of spirit, it must be\nproduced by free spirit for free spirit, and so\ncannot be a mere product of nature. Nature is capable of a formal\nbeauty, and life is capable of what Hegel calls \u201csensuous\u201d\nbeauty (PK, 197), but true beauty is found only in works of\nart that are freely created by human beings to bring before\nour minds what it is to be free spirit.\n\n\nBeauty, for Hegel, has certain formal qualities: it is the unity or\nharmony of different elements in which these elements are not just\narranged in a regular, symmetrical pattern but are unified\norganically. Hegel gives an example of genuinely beautiful\nform in his discussion of Greek sculpture: the famous Greek profile is\nbeautiful, we are told, because the forehead and the nose flow\nseamlessly into one another, in contrast to the Roman profile in which\nthere is a much sharper angle between the forehead and nose\n(Aesthetics, 2: 727\u201330).\n\n\nBeauty, however, is not just a matter of form; it is also a matter of\ncontent. This is one of Hegel\u2019s most controversial\nideas, and is one that sets him at odds with those modern artists and\nart-theorists who insist that art can embrace any content we like and,\nindeed, can dispense with content altogether. As we have seen, the\ncontent that Hegel claims is central and indispensable to genuine\nbeauty (and therefore genuine art) is the freedom and richness of\nspirit. To put it another way, that content is the Idea, or absolute\nreason, as self-knowing spirit. Since the Idea is pictured in\nreligion as \u201cGod,\u201d the content of truly beautiful art is in\none respect the divine. Yet, as we have seen above, Hegel\nargues that the Idea (or \u201cGod\u201d) comes to consciousness of\nitself only in and through finite human beings. The content of\nbeautiful art must thus be the divine in human form or the divine\nwithin humanity itself (as well as purely human freedom).\n\n\nHegel recognizes that art can portray animals, plants and inorganic\nnature, but he sees it as art\u2019s principal task to present divine and\nhuman freedom. In both cases, the focus of attention is on\nthe human figure in particular. This is because, in\nHegel\u2019s view, the most appropriate sensuous incarnation of reason and\nthe clearest visible expression of spirit is the human form. Colors\nand sounds by themselves can certainly communicate a mood, but only\nthe human form actually embodies spirit and reason. Truly beautiful\nart thus shows us sculpted, painted or poetic images of Greek gods or\nof Jesus Christ\u2014that is, the divine in human form\u2014or it\nshows us images of free human life itself.\n",
