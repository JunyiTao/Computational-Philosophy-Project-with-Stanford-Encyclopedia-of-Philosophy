    "main_text": "Physics\n4. Physics\n\nThe notion of backward causation raises a very different set of\nquestions that need to be answered before a physically adequate notion\nhas been developed.\n\n What, if anything, would in physical terms characterize\nbackward causation? \n\n\nOne has to remember that causality as such is an everyday notion that\nhas no natural application in physics. How we could physically\nidentify backward causal processes depends very much on which feature\nwe take our ordinary notion of causation to apply to a physical\nprocess. In physics we may be tempted to associate it with different\nphysical notions of processes. Four suggestions have been put forward:\n(a) the causal link can be identified with the transference of energy;\n(b) it can be identified with the conservation of physical quantities\nlike charge, linear and angular momentum; (c) it can be identified\nwith interaction of forces; or (d) it can be identified with the\nmicroscopic notion of interaction. It appears with respect to all four\nsuggestions, however, that the involved descriptions are invariant\nunder the time reversal operation.\n\nThe most fundamental laws of nature are time reversal invariant in the\nsense that our physical theories allow description of the fundamental\nreactions and processes in terms of the time reversed order. Such\nprocesses are said to be reversible in time. Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism, for instance, admits two kinds of mathematical\nsolutions for the equations describing the radiation of energy in an\nelectromagnetic field. One is called the retarded solution\nwhere radiation appears as outgoing concentric waves, the other is\nnamed the advanced solution according to which radiation\nappears as incoming concentric waves. \u00a0 Apparently the advanced\nsolution describes the temporal inverse phenomena of the retarded\nsolution so that these two solutions are usually regarded as the time\nreverse solution of the other. Nevertheless, retarded waves, like the\nincrease of entropy in quasi-closed systems, appear to be de\nfacto irreversible although they are described in terms of time\ninvariant laws. Nature seems to prefer certain processes rather than\ntheir temporally inversed counterparts in spite of the fact that the\nlaws of nature do not show such a preference. Light, radiation and\nripples on a pond always spread outwards from their source rather than\ninwards just like entropy of a quasi-closed system is always moving\nfrom lower to higher states.\n",
