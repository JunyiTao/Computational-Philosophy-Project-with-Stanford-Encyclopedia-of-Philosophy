    "main_text": "\n1. Humor\u2019s Bad Reputation\n\nWhen people are asked what\u2019s important in their lives, they\noften mention humor. Couples listing the traits they prize in their\nspouses usually put \u201csense of humor\u201d at or near the top.\nPhilosophers are concerned with what is important in life, so two\nthings are surprising about what they have said about humor. \n\nThe first is how little they have said. From ancient times to the\n20th century, the most that any notable philosopher wrote\nabout laughter or humor was an essay, and only a few lesser-known\nthinkers such as Frances Hutcheson and James Beattie wrote that much.\nThe word humor was not used in its current sense of funniness\nuntil the 18th century, we should note, and so traditional\ndiscussions were about laughter or comedy. The most that major\nphilosophers like Plato, Hobbes, and Kant wrote about laughter or\nhumor was a few paragraphs within a discussion of another topic. Henri\nBergson\u2019s 1900 Laughter was the first book by a notable\nphilosopher on humor. Martian anthropologists comparing the amount of\nphilosophical writing on humor with what has been written on, say,\njustice, or even on Rawls\u2019 Veil of Ignorance, might well\nconclude that humor could be left out of human life without much\nloss.\n\nThe second surprising thing is how negative most philosophers have\nbeen in their assessments of humor. From ancient Greece until the\n20th century, the vast majority of philosophical comments\non laughter and humor focused on scornful or mocking laughter, or on\nlaughter that overpowers people, rather than on comedy, wit, or\njoking. Plato, the most influential critic of laughter, treated laughter as\nan emotion that overrides rational self-control. In the Republic\n(388e), he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid\nlaughter, \u201cfor ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent\nlaughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\u201d Especially\ndisturbing to Plato were the passages in the Iliad and the\nOdyssey where Mount Olympus was said to ring with the\nlaughter of the gods. He protested that \u201cif anyone represents\nmen of worth as overpowered by laughter we must not accept it, much\nless if gods.\u201d\n\nAnother of Plato\u2019s objections to laughter is that it is\nmalicious. In Philebus (48\u201350), he analyzes the\nenjoyment of comedy as a form of scorn. \u201cTaken generally,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cthe ridiculous is a certain kind of evil, specifically\na vice.\u201d That vice is self-ignorance: the people we laugh at\nimagine themselves to be wealthier, better looking, or more virtuous\nthan they really are. In laughing at them, we take delight in\nsomething evil\u2014their self-ignorance\u2014and that malice is\nmorally objectionable. \n\nBecause of these objections to laughter and humor, Plato says that in\nthe ideal state, comedy should be tightly controlled. \u201cWe shall\nenjoin that such representations be left to slaves or hired aliens,\nand that they receive no serious consideration whatsoever. No free\nperson, whether woman or man, shall be found taking lessons in\nthem.\u201d \u201cNo composer of comedy, iambic or lyric verse shall\nbe permitted to hold any citizen up to laughter, by word or gesture,\nwith passion or otherwise\u201d (Laws, 7: 816e; 11:\n935e).\n\nGreek thinkers after Plato had similarly negative comments about\nlaughter and humor. Though Aristotle considered wit a valuable part of\nconversation (Nicomachean Ethics 4, 8), he agreed with Plato\nthat laughter expresses scorn. Wit, he says in the Rhetoric\n(2, 12), is educated insolence. In the Nicomachean Ethics (4,\n8) he warns that \u201cMost people enjoy amusement and jesting more\nthan they should \u2026 a jest is a kind of mockery, and lawgivers\nforbid some kinds of mockery\u2014perhaps they ought to have\nforbidden some kinds of jesting.\u201d The Stoics, with their\nemphasis on self-control, agreed with Plato that laughter diminishes\nself-control. Epictetus\u2019s Enchiridion (33) advises\n\u201cLet not your laughter be loud, frequent, or\nunrestrained.\u201d His followers said that he never laughed at\nall.\n\nThese objections to laughter and humor influenced early Christian\nthinkers, and through them later European culture. They were\nreinforced by negative representations of laughter and humor in the\nBible, the vast majority of which are linked to hostility. The only\nway God is described as laughing in the Bible is with hostility:\n\n\nThe kings of the earth stand ready, and the rulers conspire together\nagainst the Lord and his anointed king\u2026 . The Lord who sits\nenthroned in heaven laughs them to scorn; then he rebukes them in\nanger, he threatens them in his wrath (Psalm 2:2\u20135).\n\n\nGod\u2019s spokesmen in the Bible are the Prophets, and for them,\ntoo, laughter expresses hostility. In the contest between God\u2019s\nprophet Elijah and the 450 prophets of Baal, for example, Elijah\nridicules them for their god\u2019s powerlessness, and then has them\nslain (1 Kings 18:21\u201327). In the Bible, mockery is so offensive\nthat it may deserve death, as when a group of children laugh at the\nprophet Elisha for his baldness:\n\n\nHe went up from there to Bethel and, as he was on his way, some small\nboys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, \u201cGet along\nwith you, bald head, get along.\u201d He turned round and looked at\nthem and he cursed then in the name of the Lord; and two she-bears\ncame out of a wood and mauled forty-two of them (2 Kings\n2:23).\n\n\nBringing together negative assessments of laughter from the Bible with\ncriticisms from Greek philosophy, early Christian leaders such as\nAmbrose, Jerome, Basil, Ephraim, and John Chrysostom warned against\neither excessive laughter or laughter generally. Sometimes what they\ncriticized was laughter in which the person loses self-control. In his\nLong Rules, for instance, Basil the Great wrote that\n\u201craucous laughter and uncontrollable shaking of the body are not\nindications of a well-regulated soul, or of personal dignity, or\nself-mastery\u201d (in Wagner 1962, 271). Other times they linked\nlaughter with idleness, irresponsibility, lust, or anger. John\nChrysostom, for example, warned that \n\n\nLaughter often gives birth to foul discourse, and foul discourse to\nactions still more foul. Often from words and laughter proceed railing\nand insult; and from railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from\nblows and wounds, slaughter and murder. If, then, you would take good\ncounsel for yourself, avoid not merely foul words and foul deeds, or\nblows and wounds and murders, but unseasonable laughter itself (in\nSchaff 1889, 442).\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the Christian institution that most emphasized\nself-control\u2014the monastery\u2014was harsh in condemning\nlaughter. One of the earliest monastic orders, of Pachom of Egypt,\nforbade joking (Adkin 1985, 151\u2013152). The Rule of St. Benedict,\nthe most influential monastic code, advised monks to \u201cprefer\nmoderation in speech and speak no foolish chatter, nothing just to\nprovoke laughter; do not love immoderate or boisterous\nlaughter.\u201d In Benedict\u2019s Ladder of Humility, Step Ten is a\nrestraint against laughter, and Step Eleven a warning against joking\n(Gilhus 1997, 65). The monastery of St. Columbanus Hibernus had these\npunishments: \u201cHe who smiles in the service \u2026 six strokes;\nif he breaks out in the noise of laughter, a special fast unless it\nhas happened pardonably\u201d (Resnick 1987, 95).\n\nThe Christian European rejection of laughter and humor continued\nthrough the Middle Ages, and whatever the Reformers reformed, it did\nnot include the traditional assessment of humor. Among the strongest\ncondemnations came from the Puritans, who wrote tracts against\nlaughter and comedy. One by William Prynne (1633) was over 1100 pages long and purported to show that comedies \u201care sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men.\u201d It encouraged Christians to live sober, serious lives, and not to be \u201cimmoderately tickled with mere lascivious vanities, or  \u2026 lash out in excessive cachinnations in the public view of dissolute graceless persons.\u201d When the Puritans came to rule England in the mid-17th century, they outlawed comedies. \n\nAt this time, too, the philosophical case against laughter was\nstrengthened by Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Hobbes\u2019\nLeviathan (1651 [1982]) describes human beings as naturally\nindividualistic and competitive. That makes us alert to signs that we\nare winning or losing. The former make us feel good and the latter\nbad. If our perception of some sign that we are superior comes over us\nquickly, our good feelings are likely to issue in laughter. In Part I,\nch. 6, he writes that\n\n\nSudden glory, is the passion which makes those grimaces called\nlaughter; and is caused either by some sudden act of their own, that\npleases them; or by the apprehension of some deformed thing in\nanother, by comparison whereof they suddenly applaud themselves. And\nit is incident most to them, that are conscious of the fewest\nabilities in themselves; who are forced to keep themselves in their\nown favor by observing the imperfections of other men. And therefore\nmuch laughter at the defects of others, is a sign of pusillanimity.\nFor of great minds, one of the proper works is, to help and free\nothers from scorn; and to compare themselves only with the most\nable.\n\n\nA similar explanation of laughter from the same time is found in\nDescartes\u2019 Passions of the Soul. He says that laughter\naccompanies three of the six basic emotions\u2014wonder, love, (mild)\nhatred, desire, joy, and sadness. Although admitting that there are\nother causes of laughter than hatred, in Part 3 of this book,\n\u201cOf Particular Passions,\u201d he considers laughter only as an\nexpression of scorn and ridicule. \n\n\nDerision or scorn is a sort of joy mingled with hatred, which proceeds\nfrom our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be\ndeserving of it; we have hatred for this evil, we have joy in seeing\nit in him who is deserving of it; and when that comes upon us\nunexpectedly, the surprise of wonder is the cause of our bursting into\nlaughter\u2026 And we notice that people with very obvious defects\nsuch as those who are lame, blind of an eye, hunched-backed, or who\nhave received some public insult, are specially given to mockery; for,\ndesiring to see all others held in as low estimation as themselves,\nthey are truly rejoiced at the evils that befall them, and they hold\nthem deserving of these (art. 178\u2013179).\n\n2. The Superiority Theory\n\nWith these comments of Hobbes and Descartes, we have a sketchy\npsychological theory articulating the view of laughter that started in\nPlato and the Bible and dominated Western thinking about laughter for\ntwo millennia. In the 20th century, this idea was called\nthe Superiority Theory. Simply put, our laughter expresses feelings of\nsuperiority over other people or over a former state of ourselves. A\ncontemporary proponent of this theory is Roger Scruton, who analyses\namusement as an \u201cattentive demolition\u201d of a person or\nsomething connected with a person. \u201cIf people dislike being\nlaughed at,\u201d Scruton says, \u201cit is surely because laughter\ndevalues its object in the subject\u2019s eyes\u201d (in Morreall\n1987, 168).\n\nIn the 18th century, the dominance of the Superiority\nTheory began to weaken when Francis Hutcheson (1750) wrote a critique\nof Hobbes\u2019 account of laughter. Feelings of superiority,\nHutcheson argued, are neither necessary nor sufficient for laughter.\nIn laughing, we may not be comparing ourselves with anyone, as when we\nlaugh at odd figures of speech like those in this poem about a\nsunrise:\n\n\nThe sun, long since, had in the lap\n\nOf Thetis taken out his nap;\n\nAnd like a lobster boil\u2019d, the morn\n\nFrom black to red began to turn.\n\n\n\n\nIf self-comparison and sudden glory are not necessary for laughter,\nneither are they sufficient for laughter. Hutcheson says that we can\nfeel superior to lower animals without laughing, and that \u201csome\ningenuity in dogs and monkeys, which comes near to some of our own\narts, very often makes us merry; whereas their duller actions in which\nthey are much below us, are no matter of jest at all.\u201d He also\ncites cases of pity. A gentleman riding in a coach who sees ragged\nbeggars in the street, for example, will feel that he is better off\nthan they, but such feelings are unlikely to amuse him. In such\nsituations, \u201cwe are in greater danger of weeping than\nlaughing.\u201d \n\nTo these counterexamples to the Superiority Theory we could add more.\nSometimes we laugh when a comic character shows surprising skills that\nwe lack. In the silent movies of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and\nBuster Keaton, the hero is often trapped in a situation where he looks\ndoomed. But then he escapes with a clever acrobatic stunt that we\nwould not have thought of, much less been able to perform. Laughing at\nsuch scenes does not seem to require that we compare ourselves with\nthe hero; and if we do make such a comparison, we do not find\nourselves superior. \n\nAt least some people, too, laugh at themselves\u2014not a former\nstate of themselves, but what is happening now. If I search high and\nlow for my eyeglasses only to find them on my head, the Superiority\nTheory seems unable to explain my laughter at myself. \n\nWhile these examples involve persons with whom we might compare\nourselves, there are other cases of laughter where no personal\ncomparisons seem involved. In experiments by Lambert Deckers (1993),\nsubjects were asked to lift a series of apparently identical weights.\nThe first several weights turned out to be identical, and that\nstrengthened the expectation that the remaining weights would be the\nsame. But then subjects picked up a weight that was much heavier or\nlighter than the others. Most laughed, but apparently not out of\nHobbesian \u201csudden glory,\u201d and apparently without comparing\nthemselves with anyone.\n3. The Relief Theory\n\nFurther weakening the dominance of the Superiority Theory in the\n18th century were two new accounts of laughter which are\nnow called the Relief Theory and the Incongruity Theory. Neither even\nmentions feelings of superiority.\n\nThe Relief Theory is an hydraulic explanation in which laughter does\nin the nervous system what a pressure-relief valve does in a steam\nboiler. The theory was sketched in Lord Shaftesbury\u2019s 1709 essay\n\u201cAn Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humor,\u201d the first\npublication in which humor is used in its modern sense of\nfunniness. Scientists at the time knew that nerves connect the brain\nwith the sense organs and muscles, but they thought that nerves\ncarried \u201canimal spirits\u201d\u2014gases and liquids such as\nair and blood. John Locke (1690, Book 3, ch. 9, para.16), for\ninstance, describes animal spirits as \u201cfluid and subtile Matter,\npassing through the Conduits of the Nerves.\u201d \n\nShaftesbury\u2019s explanation of laughter is that it releases animal\nspirits that have built up pressure inside the nerves. \n\n\nThe natural free spirits of ingenious men, if imprisoned or\ncontrolled, will find out other ways of motion to relieve themselves\nin their constraint; and whether it be in burlesque, mimicry, or\nbuffoonery, they will be glad at any rate to vent themselves, and be\nrevenged upon their constrainers.\n\n\nOver the next two centuries, as the nervous system came to be better\nunderstood, thinkers such as Herbert Spencer and Sigmund Freud revised\nthe biology behind the Relief Theory but kept the idea that laughter\nrelieves pent-up nervous energy. \n\nSpencer\u2019s explanation in his essay \u201cOn the Physiology of\nLaughter\u201d (1911) is based on the idea that emotions take the\nphysical form of nervous energy. Nervous energy, he says,\n\u201calways tends to beget muscular motion, and when it rises to a\ncertain intensity, always does beget it\u201d (299). \u201cFeeling\npassing a certain pitch habitually vents itself in bodily\naction\u201d (302). When we are angry, for example, nervous energy\nproduces small aggressive movements such as clenching our fists; and\nif the energy reaches a certain level, we attack the offending person.\nIn fear, the energy produces small-scale movements in preparation for\nfleeing; and if the fear gets strong enough, we flee. The movements\nassociated with emotions, then, discharge or release the built-up\nnervous energy. \n\nLaughter releases nervous energy, too, Spencer says, but with this\nimportant difference: the muscular movements in laughter are not the\nearly stages of larger practical actions such as attacking or fleeing.\nUnlike emotions, laughter does not involve the motivation to do\nanything. The movements of laughter, Spencer says, \u201chave no\nobject\u201d (303): they are merely a release of nervous\nenergy. \n\nThe nervous energy relieved through laughter, according to Spencer, is\nthe energy of emotions that have been found to be inappropriate.\nConsider this poem entitled \u201cWaste\u201d by Harry Graham\n(2009):\n\n\nI had written to Aunt Maud\n\nWho was on a trip abroad\n\nWhen I heard she\u2019d died of cramp,\n\nJust too late to save the stamp.\n\n\nReading the first three lines, we might feel pity for the bereaved\nnephew writing the poem. But the last line makes us reinterpret those\nlines. Far from being a loving nephew in mourning, he turns out to be\nan insensitive cheapskate. So the nervous energy of our pity, now\nsuperfluous, is released in laughter. That discharge occurs, Spencer\nsays, first through the muscles \u201cwhich feeling most habitually\nstimulates,\u201d the muscles of the vocal tract. If still more\nenergy needs to be relieved, it spills over to the muscles connected\nwith breathing, and if the movements of those muscles do not release\nall the energy, the remainder moves the arms, legs, and other muscle\ngroups (304). \n\nIn the 20th century, John Dewey (1894: 558\u2013559) had a\nsimilar version of the Relief Theory. Laughter, he said, \u201cmarks\nthe ending \u2026 of a period of suspense, or expectation.\u201d It\nis a \u201csudden relaxation of strain, so far as occurring through\nthe medium of the breathing and vocal apparatus\u2026 The laugh is\nthus a phenomenon of the same general kind as the sigh of\nrelief.\u201d \n\nBetter known than the versions of the Relief Theory of Shaftesbury,\nSpencer, and Dewey is that of Sigmund Freud. In his Jokes and\nTheir Relation to the Unconscious (1905 [1974]), Freud analyzes\nthree laughter situations: der Witz (often translated\n\u201cjokes\u201d or \u201cjoking\u201d), \u201cthe comic,\u201d\nand \u201chumor.\u201d In all three, laughter releases nervous\nenergy that was summoned for a psychological task, but then became\nsuperfluous as that task was abandoned. In der Witz, that\nsuperfluous energy is energy used to repress feelings; in the comic it\nis energy used to think, and in humor it is the energy of feeling\nemotions. (In this article, we are not using humor in\nFreud\u2019s narrow sense, but in the general sense that includes\njoking, wit, the comic, etc.)\n\nDer Witz includes telling prepared fictional jokes, making\nspontaneous witty comments, and repartee. In der Witz, Freud\nsays, the psychic energy released is the energy that would have\nrepressed the emotions that are being expressed as the person laughs.\n(Most summaries of Freud\u2019s theory of joking mistakenly describe laughter as a release of repressed emotions themselves.) According to Freud,\nthe emotions which are most repressed are sexual desire and hostility,\nand so most jokes and witty remarks are about sex, hostility, or both.\nIn telling a sexual joke or listening to one, we bypass our internal\ncensor and give vent to our libido. In telling or listening to a joke\nthat puts down an individual or group we dislike, similarly, we let\nout the hostility we usually repress. In both cases, the psychic\nenergy normally used to do the repressing becomes superfluous, and is\nreleased in laughter. \n\nFreud\u2019s second laughter situation, \u201cthe comic,\u201d\ninvolves a similar release of energy that is summoned but is then\nfound unnecessary. Here it is the energy normally devoted to thinking.\nAn example is laughter at the clumsy actions of a clown. As we watch\nthe clown stumble through actions that we would perform smoothly and\nefficiently, there is a saving of the energy that we would normally\nexpend to understand the clown\u2019s movements. Here Freud appeals\nto a theory of \u201cmimetic representation\u201d in which we expend\na large packet of energy to understand something large and a small\npacket of energy to understand something small. Our mental\nrepresentation of the clown\u2019s clumsy movements, Freud says,\ncalls for more energy than the energy we would expend to mentally\nrepresent our own smooth, efficient movements in performing the same\ntask. Our laughter at the clown is our venting of that surplus\nenergy.\n\n\nThese two possibilities in my imagination amount to a comparison\nbetween the observed movement and my own. If the other person\u2019s\nmovement is exaggerated and inexpedient, my increased expenditure in\norder to understand it is inhibited in statu nascendi, as it\nwere in the act of being mobilized; it is declared superfluous and is\nfree for use elsewhere or perhaps for discharge by laughter (Freud\n1905 [1974], 254). \n\n\nFreud analyzes the third laughter situation, which he calls\n\u201chumor,\u201d much as Spencer analyzed laughter in general.\nHumor occurs \u201cif there is a situation in which, according to our\nusual habits, we should be tempted to release a distressing affect and\nif motives then operate upon us which suppress that affect in\nstatu nascendi [in the process of being born]\u2026 . The\npleasure of humor \u2026 comes about \u2026 at the cost of a\nrelease of affect that does not occur: it arise from an economy in\nthe expenditure of affect\u201d (293). His example is a story\ntold by Mark Twain in which his brother was building a road when a\ncharge of dynamite went off prematurely, blowing him high into the\nsky. When the poor man came down far from the work site, he was docked\nhalf a day\u2019s pay for being \u201cabsent from his place of\nemployment.\u201d Freud\u2019s explanation of our laughter at this\nstory is like the explanation above at Graham\u2019s poem about the\ncheapskate nephew. In laughing at this story, he says, we are\nreleasing the psychic energy that we had summoned to feel pity for\nTwain\u2019s brother, but that became superfluous when we heard the\nfantastic last part. \u201cAs a result of this understanding, the\nexpenditure on the pity, which was already prepared, becomes\nunutilizable and we laugh it off\u201d (295).\n\nHaving sketched several versions of the Relief Theory, we can note\nthat today almost no scholar in philosophy or psychology explains\nlaughter or humor as a process of releasing pent-up nervous energy.\nThere is, of course, a connection between laughter and the expenditure\nof energy. Hearty laughter involves many muscle groups and several\nareas of the nervous system. Laughing hard gives our lungs a workout,\ntoo, as we take in far more oxygen than usual. But few contemporary\nscholars defend the claims of Spencer and Freud that the energy\nexpended in laughter is the energy of feeling emotions, the energy of\nrepressing emotions, or the energy of thinking, which have built up\nand require venting. \n\nFunny things and situations may evoke emotions, but many seem not to.\nConsider P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s line \u201cIf it\u2019s feasible,\nlet\u2019s fease it.\u201d Or the shortest poem in the English\nlanguage, by Strickland Gillilan (1927), \u201cLines on the Antiquity\nof Microbes\u201d:\n\n\nAdam\n\nHad\u2019em.\n\n\nThese do not seem to vent emotions that had built up before we read\nthem, and they do not seem to summon emotions and then render them\nsuperfluous. So whatever energy is expended in laughing at them does\nnot seem to be superfluous energy being vented. In fact, the whole\nhydraulic model of the nervous system on which the Relief Theory is\nbased seems outdated.\n\nTo that hydraulic model, Freud adds several questionable claims\nderived from his general psychoanalytic theory of the mind. He says\nthat the creation of der Witz\u2014jokes and witty\ncomments\u2014is an unconscious process of letting repressed thoughts\nand feelings into the conscious mind. This claim seems falsified by\nprofessional humorists who approach the creation of jokes and cartoons\nwith conscious strategies. Freud\u2019s account of how psychic energy\nis vented in joke-telling is also questionable, especially his claim\nthat packets of psychic energy are summoned to repress thoughts and\nfeelings, but in statu nascendi (in the process of being\nborn) are rendered superfluous. If Freud is right that the energy\nreleased in laughing at a joke is the energy normally used to repress\nhostile and sexual feelings, then it seems that those who laugh\nhardest at aggressive and sexual jokes should be people who usually\nrepress such feelings. But studies about joke preferences by Hans\nJ\u00fcrgen Eysenck (1972, xvi) have shown that the people who enjoy\naggressive and sexual humor the most are not those who usually repress\nhostile and sexual feelings, but those who express them.\n\nFreud\u2019s account of \u201cthe comic\u201d faces still more\nproblems, particularly his ideas about \u201cmimetic\nrepresentation.\u201d The psychic energy saved, he says, is energy\nsummoned for understanding something, such as the antics of a clown.\nWe summon a large packet of energy to understand the clown\u2019s\nlarge movements, but as we are summoning it, we compare it with the\nsmall packet of energy required to understand our own smaller\nmovements in doing the same thing. The difference between the two\npackets is surplus energy discharged in laughter. Freud\u2019s\naccount of thinking here is idiosyncratic and has strange\nimplications, such as that thinking about swimming the English Channel\ntakes far more energy than thinking about licking a stamp. With all\nthese difficulties, it is not surprising that philosophers and\npsychologists studying humor today do not appeal to Freud\u2019s\ntheory to explain laughter or humor. More generally, the Relief Theory\nis seldom used as a general explanation of laughter or humor.\n4. The Incongruity Theory\n\nThe second account of humor that arose in the 18th century\nto challenge the Superiority Theory was the Incongruity Theory. While\nthe Superiority Theory says that the cause of laughter is feelings of\nsuperiority, and the Relief Theory says that it is the release of\nnervous energy, the Incongruity Theory says that it is the perception\nof something incongruous\u2014something that violates our mental\npatterns and expectations. This approach was taken by James Beattie,\nImmanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and many\nlater philosophers and psychologists. It is now the dominant theory of\nhumor in philosophy and psychology. \n\nAlthough Aristotle did not use the term incongruity, he hints\nthat it is the basis for at least some humor. In the Rhetoric\n(3, 2), a handbook for speakers, he says that one way for a speaker to\nget a laugh is to create an expectation in the audience and then\nviolate it. As an example, he cites this line from a comedy,\n\u201cAnd as he walked, beneath his feet were\u2014chilblains [sores\non the feet].\u201d Jokes that depend on a change of spelling or word\nplay, he notes, can have the same effect. Cicero, in On the\nOrator (ch. 63), says that \u201cThe most common kind of joke is\nthat in which we expect one thing and another is said; here our own\ndisappointed expectation makes us laugh.\u201d \n\nThis approach to joking is similar to techniques of stand-up comedians\ntoday. They speak of the set-up and the punch\n(line). The set-up is the first part of the joke: it creates the\nexpectation. The punch (line) is the last part that violates that\nexpectation. In the language of the Incongruity Theory, the\njoke\u2019s ending is incongruous with the beginning.\n\nThe first philosopher to use the word incongruous to analyze\nhumor was James Beattie (1779). When we see something funny, he says,\nour laughter \u201calways proceeds from a sentiment or emotion,\nexcited in the mind, in consequence of certain objects or ideas being\npresented to it\u201d (304). Our laughter \u201cseems to arise from\nthe view of things incongruous united in the same assemblage\u201d\n(318). The cause of humorous laughter is \u201ctwo or more\ninconsistent, unsuitable, or incongruous parts or circumstances,\nconsidered as united in one complex object or assemblage, as acquiring\na sort of mutual relation from the peculiar manner in which the mind\ntakes notice of them\u201d (320). \n\nImmanuel Kant (1790 [1911], First Part, sec. 54), a contemporary of\nBeattie\u2019s, did not used the term incongruous but had an\nexplanation of laughter at jokes and wit that involves\nincongruity.\n\n\nIn everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must\nbe something absurd (in which the understanding, therefore, can find\nno satisfaction). Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden\ntransformation of a strained expectation into nothing. This\ntransformation, which is certainly not enjoyable to the understanding,\nyet indirectly gives it very active enjoyment for a moment. Therefore\nits cause must consist in the influence of the representation upon the\nbody, and the reflex effect of this upon the mind.\n\n\nKant illustrates with this story:\n\n\nAn Indian at the table of an Englishman in Surat, when he saw a bottle\nof ale opened and all the beer turned into froth and overflowing,\ntestified his great astonishment with many exclamations. When the\nEnglishman asked him, \u201cWhat is there in this to astonish you so\nmuch?\u201d he answered, \u201cI am not at all astonished that it\nshould flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.\u201d \n\n\nWe laugh at this story, Kant says, \u201cnot because we deem\nourselves cleverer than this ignorant man, or because of anything in\nit that we note as satisfactory to the understanding, but because our\nexpectation was strained (for a time) and then was suddenly dissipated\ninto nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must note well,\u201d Kant insists, that it [our\nexpectation] does not transform itself into the positive opposite of\nan expected object\u2026 but it must be transformed into\nnothing.\u201c He illustrates with two more jokes:\n\n\nThe heir of a rich relative wished to arrange for an imposing funeral,\nbut he lamented that he could not properly succeed; \u2018for\u2019\n(said he) \u2018the more money I give my mourners to look sad, the\nmore cheerful they look!\u2019\n\n[A] merchant returning from India to Europe with all his wealth in\nmerchandise \u2026 was forced to throw it overboard in a heavy storm\nand \u2026 grieved thereat so much that his wig turned gray the same\nnight.\u201d\n\n\nA joke amuses us by evoking, shifting, and dissipating our thoughts,\nbut we do not learn anything through these mental gymnastics. In humor\ngenerally, according to Kant, our reason finds nothing of worth. The\njostling of ideas, however, produces a physical jostling of our\ninternal organs and we enjoy that physical stimulation.\n\n\nFor if we admit that with all our thoughts is harmonically combined a\nmovement in the organs of the body, we will easily comprehend how to\nthis sudden transposition of the mind, now to one now to another\nstandpoint in order to contemplate its object, may correspond an\nalternating tension and relaxation of the elastic portions of our\nintestines which communicates itself to the diaphragm (like that which\nticklish people feel). In connection with this the lungs expel the air\nat rapidly succeeding intervals, and thus bring about a movement\nbeneficial to health; which alone, and not what precedes it in the\nmind, is the proper cause of the gratification in a thought that at\nbottom represents nothing.\n\n\nOn this point, Kant compares the enjoyment of joking and wit to the\nenjoyment of games of chance and the enjoyment of music. In all three\nthe pleasure is in a \u201cchanging free play of sensations,\u201d\nwhich is caused by shifting ideas in the mind. In games of chance,\n\u201cthe play of fortune\u201d causes bodily excitation; in music,\nit is \u201cthe play of tone,\u201d and in joking, it is \u201cthe\nplay of thought.\u201d In a lively game of chance, \u201cthe\naffections of hope, fear, joy, wrath, scorn, are put in play \u2026\nalternating every moment; and they are so vivid that by them, as by a\nkind of internal motion, all the vital processes of the body seem to\nbe promoted.\u201d In music and humor, similarly, what we enjoy are\nbodily changes caused by rapidly shifting ideas.\n\n\nMusic and that which excites laughter are two different kinds of play\nwith aesthetical ideas, or of representations of the understanding\nthrough which ultimately nothing is thought, which can give lively\ngratification merely by their changes. Thus we recognize pretty\nclearly that the animation in both cases is merely bodily, although it\nis excited by ideas of the mind; and that the feeling of health\nproduced by a motion of the intestines corresponding to the play in\nquestion makes up that whole gratification of a gay party.\n\n\nA version of the Incongruity Theory that gave it more philosophical\nsignificance than Kant\u2019s version is that of Arthur Schopenhauer\n(1818/1844 [1907]). While Kant located the lack of fit in humor\nbetween our expectations and our experience, Schopenhauer locates it\nbetween our sense perceptions of things and our abstract rational\nknowledge of those same things. We perceive unique individual things\nwith many properties. But when we group our sense perceptions under\nabstract concepts, we focus on just one or a few properties of any\nindividual thing. Thus we lump quite different things under one\nconcept and one word. Think, for example, of a Chihuahua and a St.\nBernard categorized under dog. For Schopenhauer, humor arises\nwhen we suddenly notice the incongruity between a concept and a\nperception that are supposed to be of the same thing. \n\n\nMany human actions can only be performed by the help of reason and\ndeliberation, and yet there are some which are better performed\nwithout its assistance. This very incongruity of sensuous and abstract\nknowledge, on account of which the latter always merely approximates\nto the former, as mosaic approximates to painting, is the cause of a\nvery remarkable phenomenon which, like reason itself, is peculiar to\nhuman nature, and of which the explanations that have ever anew been\nattempted, as insufficient: I mean laughter\u2026 . The cause of\nlaughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the\nincongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been\nthought through it in some relation, and laughter itself is just the\nexpression of this incongruity (1818/1844 [1907], Book I, sec.\n13).\n\n\nAs an example, Schopenhauer tells of the prison guards who allowed a\nconvict to play cards with them, but when they caught him cheating,\nthey kicked him out. He comments, \u201cThey let themselves be led by\nthe general conception, \u2018Bad companions are turned out,\u2019\nand forget that he is also a prisoner, i. e., one whom they ought to\nhold fast\u201d (Supplement to Book I: Ch. 8). He also comments on an\nAustrian joke (the equivalent of a Polish joke in the U.S. a few\ndecades ago):\n\n\nWhen someone had declared that he was fond of walking alone, an\nAustrian said to him: \u201cYou like walking alone; so do I:\ntherefore we can go together.\u201d He starts from the conception,\n\u201cA pleasure which two love they can enjoy in common,\u201d and\nsubsumes under it the very case which excludes community.\n\n\nCreating jokes like these requires the ability to think of an abstract\nidea under which very different things can be subsumed. Wit,\nSchopenhauer says, \u201cconsists entirely in a facility for finding\nfor every object that appears a conception under which it certainly\ncan be thought, though it is very different from all the other objects\nwhich come under this conception\u201d (Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nWith this theory of humor as based on the discrepancy between abstract\nideas and real things, Schopenhauer explains the offensiveness of\nbeing laughed at, the kind of laughter at the heart of the Superiority\nTheory. \n\n\nThat the laughter of others at what we do or say seriously offends us\nso keenly depends on the fact that it asserts that there is a great\nincongruity between our conceptions and the objective realities. For\nthe same reason, the predicate \u201cludicrous\u201d or\n\u201cabsurd\u201d is insulting. The laugh of scorn announces with\ntriumph to the baffled adversary how incongruous were the conceptions\nhe cherished with the reality which is now revealing itself to him\n(Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nWith his theory, too, Schopenhauer explains the pleasure of humor.\n\n\n\nIn every suddenly appearing conflict between what is perceived and\nwhat is thought, what is perceived is always unquestionably right; for\nit is not subject to error at all, requires no confirmation from\nwithout, but answers for itself. \u2026 The victory of knowledge of\nperception over thought affords us pleasure. For perception is the\noriginal kind of knowledge inseparable from animal nature, in which\neverything that gives direct satisfaction to the will presents itself.\nIt is the medium of the present, of enjoyment and gaiety; moreover it\nis attended with no exertion. With thinking the opposite is the case:\nit is the second power of knowledge, the exercise of which always\ndemands some, and often considerable exertion. Besides, it is the\nconceptions of thought that often oppose the gratification of our\nimmediate desires, for, as the medium of the past, the future, and of\nseriousness, they are the vehicles of our fears, our repentance, and\nall our cares. It must therefore be diverting to us to see this\nstrict, untiring, troublesome governess, the reason, for once\nconvicted of insufficiency. On this account then the mien or\nappearance of laughter is very closely related to that of joy\n(Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nLike Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard saw humor as based on\nincongruity and as philosophically significant. In his discussion of\nthe \u201cthree spheres of existence,\u201d (the three existential\nstages of life\u2014the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious),\nhe discusses humor and its close relative, irony. Irony marks the\nboundary between the aesthetic and the ethical spheres, while humor\nmarks the boundary between the ethical and religious spheres.\n\u201cHumor is the last stage of existential awareness before\nfaith\u201d (1846 [1941], 448, 259). The person with a religious view\nof life is likely to cultivate humor, he says, and Christianity is the\nmost humorous view of life in world history ([JP], Entries\n1681\u20131682).\n\nKierkegaard (1846 [1941], 459\u2013468) locates the essence of humor,\nwhich he calls \u201cthe comical,\u201d in a disparity between what\nis expected and what is experienced, though instead of calling it\n\u201cincongruity\u201d he calls it \u201ccontradiction.\u201d For\nexample, \u201cErrors are comical, and are all to be explained by the\ncontradiction involved.\u201d He cites the story of the baker who\nsaid to the begging woman, \u201cNo, mother, I cannot give you\nanything. There was another here recently whom I had to send away\nwithout giving anything, too: we cannot give to everybody.\u201d\n\nThe violation of our expectations is at the heart of the tragic as\nwell as the comic, Kierkegaard says. To contrast the two, he appeals\nto Aristotle\u2019s definition of the comic in Chapter 5 of The\nPoetics: \u201cThe ridiculous is a mistake or unseemliness that\nis not painful or destructive.\u201d\n\n\nThe tragic and the comic are the same, in so far as both are based on\ncontradiction; but the tragic is the suffering contradiction, the\ncomical, the painless contradiction\u2026 . The comic apprehension\nevokes the contradiction or makes it manifest by having in mind the\nway out, which is why the contradiction is painless. The tragic\napprehension sees the contradiction and despairs of a way out.\n\n\nA few decades earlier, William Hazlitt contrasted the tragic and comic\nthis way in his essay \u201cOn Wit and Humor\u201d:\n\n\nMan is the only animal that laughs and weeps: for he is the only\nanimal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and\nwhat they ought to be. We weep at what thwarts or exceeds our desires\nin serious matters; we laugh at what only disappoints our expectations\nin trifles\u2026 . To explain the nature of laughter and tears, is\nto account for the condition of human life; for it is in a manner\ncompounded of the two! It is a tragedy or a comedy\u2014sad or merry,\nas it happens\u2026 . Tears may be considered as the natural and\ninvoluntary resource of the mind overcome by some sudden and violent\nemotion, before it has had time to reconcile its feelings to the\nchange of circumstances: while laughter may be defined to be the same\nsort of convulsive and involuntary movement, occasioned by mere\nsurprise or contrast (in the absence of any more serious emotion),\nbefore it has time to reconcile its belief to contrary appearances\n(Hazlitt 1819 [1907], 1).\n\n\nThe core meaning of \u201cincongruity\u201d in various versions of\nthe Incongruity Theory, then, is that some thing or event we perceive\nor think about violates our standard mental patterns and normal\nexpectations. (If we are listening to a joke for the second time, of\ncourse, there is a sense in which we expect the incongruous punch\nline, but it still violates our ordinary expectations.) Beyond that\ncore meaning, various thinkers have added different details, many of\nwhich are incompatible with each other. In contemporary psychology,\nfor example, theorists such as Thomas Schultz (1976) and Jerry Suls\n(1972, 1983) have claimed that what we enjoy in humor is not\nincongruity itself, but the resolution of incongruity. After age\nseven, Schultz says, we require the fitting of the apparently\nanomalous element into some conceptual schema. That is what happens\nwhen we \u201cget\u201d a joke. Indeed, Schultz does not even call\nunresolvable incongruity \u201chumor\u201d\u2014he calls it\n\u201cnonsense.\u201d The examples of humor cited by these theorists are typically jokes in\nwhich the punch line is momentarily confusing, but then the hearer\nreinterprets the first part so that it makes a kind of sense. When,\nfor instance, Mae West said, \u201cMarriage is a great institution,\nbut I\u2019m not ready for an institution,\u201d the shift in\nmeanings of \u201cinstitution\u201d is the incongruity, but it takes\na moment to follow that shift, and the pleasure is in figuring out\nthat the word has two meanings. Amusement, according to this\nunderstanding of humor, is akin to puzzle-solving. Other theorists\ninsist that incongruity-resolution figures in only some humor, and\nthat the pleasure of amusement is not like puzzle-solving. \n\nAs philosophers and psychologists refined the Incongruity Theory in\nthe late 20th century, one flaw in several older versions\ncame to light: they said, or more often implied, that the perception\nof incongruity is sufficient for humor. That is clearly false, since\nwhen our mental patterns and expectations are violated, we may well\nfeel fear, disgust, or anger and not amusement. James Beattie, the\nfirst philosopher to analyze humor as a response to incongruity, was\ncareful to point out that laughter is only one such response. Our\nperception of incongruity will not excite the \u201crisible\nemotion,\u201d he said, when that perception is \u201cattended with\nsome other emotion of greater authority\u201d such as fear, pity,\nmoral disapprobation, indignation, or disgust (1779, 420). \n\nOne way to correct this flaw is to say that humorous amusement is not\njust any response to incongruity, but a way of enjoying\nincongruity. Michael Clark, for example, offers these three features\nas necessary and sufficient for humor: \n\nA person perceives (thinks, imagines) an object as being\nincongruous.\n The person enjoys perceiving (thinking, imagining) the object.\n\n The person enjoys the perceived (thought, imagined) incongruity\nat least partly for itself, rather than solely for some ulterior\nreason (in Morreall 1987, 139\u2013155).\n\n\nThis version of the Incongruity Theory is an improvement on theories\nwhich describe amusement as the perception of incongruity, but it\nstill seems not specific enough. Amusement is one way of enjoying\nincongruity, but not the only way. Mike W. Martin offers several\nexamples from the arts (in Morreall, 1987, 176). Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus the King has many lines in which Oedipus vows to do\nwhatever it takes to bring King Laius\u2019 killer to justice. We in\nthe audience, knowing that Oedipus is himself that killer, may enjoy\nthe incongruity of a king threatening himself, but that enjoyment need\nnot be humorous amusement. John Morreall (1987, 204\u2013205) argues\nthat a number of aesthetic categories\u2014 the grotesque, the\nmacabre, the horrible, the bizarre, and the fantastic\u2014involve a\nnon-humorous enjoyment of some violation of our mental patterns and\nexpectations.\n\nWhatever refinements the Incongruity Theory might require, it seems\nbetter able to account for laughter and humor than the scientifically\nobsolete Relief Theory. It also seems more comprehensive than the\nSuperiority Theory since it can account for kinds of humor that do not\nseem based on superiority, such as puns and other wordplay. \n5. Humor as Play, Laughter as Play Signal\n\nWhile the Incongruity Theory made humor look less objectionable than\nthe Superiority Theory did, it has not improved philosophers\u2019\nopinions of humor much in the last two centuries, at least judging\nfrom what they have published. Part of the continued bad reputation of\nhumor comes from a new objection triggered by the Incongruity Theory:\nIf humor is enjoying the violation of our mental patterns and\nexpectations, then it is irrational. This Irrationality Objection is\nalmost as old as the Incongruity Theory, and is implicit in\nKant\u2019s claim that the pleasure in laughter is only physical and\nnot intellectual. \u201cHow could a delusive expectation\ngratify?\u201d he asks. According to Kant, humor feels good in spite\nof, not because of, the way it frustrates our desire to understand.\nGeorge Santayana (1896, 248) agreed, arguing that incongruity itself\ncould not be enjoyed. \n\n\nWe have a prosaic background of common sense and everyday reality;\nupon this background an unexpected idea suddenly impinges. But the\nthing is a futility. The comic accident falsifies the nature before\nus, starts a wrong analogy in the mind, a suggestion that cannot be\ncarried out. In a word, we are in the presence of an absurdity, and\nman, being a rational animal, can like absurdity no better than he can\nlike hunger or cold.\n\n\nIf the widespread contemporary appreciation of humor is defensible,\nthen this Irrationality Objection needs to be addressed. To do that\nseems to require an explanation of how our higher mental functions can\noperate in a beneficial way that is different from theoretical and\npractical reasoning. One way to construct that explanation is to\nanalyze humor as a kind of play, and explain how such play can be\nbeneficial. \n\nRemarkably few philosophers have even mentioned that humor is a kind\nof play, much less seen benefits in such play. Kant spoke of joking as\n\u201cthe play of thought,\u201d though he saw no value in it beyond\nlaughter\u2019s stimulation of the internal organs. One of the few to\nclassify humor as play and see value in the mental side of humor was\nThomas Aquinas. He followed the lead of Aristotle, who said in the\nNicomachean Ethics (Ch. 8) that \u201cLife includes\nrest as well as activity, and in this is included leisure and\namusement.\u201d Some people carry amusement to\nexcess\u2014\u201cvulgar buffoons,\u201d Aristotle calls\nthem\u2014but just as bad are \u201cthose who can neither make a\njoke themselves nor put up with those who do,\u201d whom he calls\n\u201cboorish and unpolished.\u201d Between buffoonery and\nboorishness there is a happy medium\u2014engaging in humor at the\nright time and place, and to the right degree. This virtue Aristotle\ncalls eutrapelia, ready-wittedness, from the Greek for\n\u201cturning well.\u201d In his Summa Theologiae (2a2ae,\nQ. 168) Aquinas extends Aristotle\u2019s ideas in three articles:\n\u201cWhether there can be virtue in actions done in play,\u201d\n\u201cThe sin of playing too much,\u201d and \u201cThe sin of\nplaying too little.\u201d He agrees with Aristotle that humor and\nother forms of play provide occasional rest:\n\n\nAs bodily tiredness is eased by resting the body, so psychological\ntiredness is eased by resting the soul. As we have explained in\ndiscussing the feelings, pleasure is rest for the soul. And therefore\nthe remedy for weariness of soul lies in slackening the tension of\nmental study and taking some pleasure\u2026 . Those words and deeds\nin which nothing is sought beyond the soul\u2019s pleasure are called\nplayful or humorous, and it is necessary to make use of them at times\nfor solace of soul (2a2ae, Q. 168, Art. 2).\n\n\nBeyond providing rest for the soul, Aquinas suggests that humor has\nsocial benefits. Extending the meaning of Aristotle\u2019s\neutrapelia, he talks about \u201ca eutrapelos, a\npleasant person with a happy cast of mind who gives his words and\ndeeds a cheerful turn.\u201d The person who is never playful or\nhumorous, Aquinas says, is acting \u201cagainst reason\u201d and so\nis guilty of a vice.\n\n\nAnything conflicting with reason in human action is vicious. It is\nagainst reason for a man to be burdensome to others, by never showing\nhimself agreeable to others or being a kill-joy or wet blanket on\ntheir enjoyment. And so Seneca says, \u201cBear yourself with wit,\nlest you be regarded as sour or despised as dull.\u201d Now those who\nlack playfulness are sinful, those who never say anything to make you\nsmile, or are grumpy with those who do (2a2ae, Q. 168, Art. 4).\n\n\nIn the last century an early play theory of humor was developed by Max\nEastman (1936), who found parallels to humor in the play of animals,\nparticularly in the laughter of chimps during tickling. He argues that\n\u201cwe come into the world endowed with an instinctive tendency to\nlaugh and have this feeling in response to pains presented\nplayfully\u201d (45). In humor and play generally, according to\nEastman, we take a disinterested attitude toward something that could\ninstead be treated seriously. \n\nIn the late 20th century Ted Cohen (1999) wrote about the\nsocial benefits of joke-telling, and many psychologists confirmed\nAquinas\u2019 assessment of humor as virtuous. A chapter in the\nAmerican Psychological Association\u2019s Character Strengths and\nVirtues: A Handbook and Classification, under \u201cStrengths of\nTranscendence,\u201d is \u201cHumor [Playfulness].\u201d Engaging\nin humor can foster a tolerance for ambiguity and diversity, and\npromote creative problem-solving. It can serve as a social lubricant,\nengendering trust and reducing conflict. In communications that tend\nto evoke negative emotions--announcing bad news, apologizing,\ncomplaining, warning, criticizing, commanding, evaluating--humor can\nprovide delight that reduces or even blocks negative emotions.\nConsider this paragraph from a debt-collection letter:\n\n\nWe appreciate your business, but, please, give us a break. Your\naccount is overdue ten months. That means we\u2019ve carried you\nlonger than your mother did (Morreall 2009, 117).\n\n\nPlay activities such as humor are not usually pursued in order\nto achieve such benefits, of course; they are pursued, as Aquinas\nsaid, for pleasure. A parallel with humor here is music, which we\ntypically play and listen to for pleasure, but which can boost our\nmanual dexterity and even mathematical abilities, reduce stress, and\nstrengthen our social bonds. \n\nEthologists (students of animal, including human, behavior) point out\nthat in play activities, young animals learn important skills they\nwill need later on. Young lions, for example, play by going through\nactions that will be part of hunting. Humans have hunted with rocks\nand spears for tens of thousands of years, and so boys often play by\nthrowing projectiles at targets. Marek Spinka (2001) observes that in\nplaying, young animals move in exaggerated ways. Young monkeys leap\nnot just from branch to branch, but from trees into rivers. Children\nnot only run, but skip and do cartwheels. Spinka suggests that in play\nyoung animals are testing the limits of their speed, balance, and\ncoordination. In doing so, they learn to cope with unexpected\nsituations such as being chased by a new kind of predator.\n\nThis account of the value of play in children and young animals does\nnot automatically explain why humor is important to adult humans, but\nfor us as for children and young animals, the play activities that\nseem the most fun are those in which we exercise our abilities in\nunusual and extreme ways, yet in a safe setting. Sports is an example.\nSo is humor. \n\nIn humor the abilities we exercise in unusual and extreme ways in a\nsafe setting are related to thinking and interacting with other\npeople. What is enjoyed is incongruity, the violation of our mental\npatterns and expectations. In joking with friends, for example, we\nbreak rules of conversation such as these formulated by H. P. Grice\n(1975):\n\n Do not say what you believe to be false.\n Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\n Avoid obscurity of expression.\n Avoid ambiguity.\n Be brief.\n\n\nWe break Rule 1 when for a laugh we exaggerate wildly, say the\nopposite of what we think, or \u201cpull someone\u2019s leg.\u201d\nWe break Rule 2 when we present funny fantasies as if they were facts.\nRule 3 is broken to create humor when we reply to an embarrassing\nquestion with an obviously vague or confusing answer. We violate Rule\n4 in telling most prepared jokes, as Victor Raskin (1984) has shown. A\ncomment or story starts off with an assumed interpretation for a\nphrase, but then at the punch line, switches to a second, usually\nopposed interpretation. Consider the line \u201cI love cats. They taste a lot like chicken.\u201d Rule 5 is broken when we turn an ordinary\ncomplaint into a comic rant like those of Roseanne Barr and Lewis\nBlack. \n\nHumor, like other play, sometimes takes the form of activity that\nwould not be mistaken for serious activity. Wearing a red clown nose\nand making up nonsense syllables are examples. More often, however, as\nin the conversational moves above, humor and play are modeled on\nserious activities. When in conversation we switch from serious\ndiscussion to making funny comments, for example, we keep the same\nvocabulary and grammar, and our sentences transcribed to paper might\nlook like bona-fide assertions, questions, etc. This similarity\nbetween non-serious and serious language and actions calls for ways\nthat participants can distinguish between the two. Ethologists call\nthese ways \u201cplay signals.\u201d \n\nThe oldest play signals in humans are smiling and laughing. According\nto ethologists, these evolved from similar play signals in pre-human\napes. The apes that evolved into Homo sapiens split off from\nthe apes that evolved into chimpanzees and gorillas about six million\nyears ago. In chimps and gorillas, as in other mammals, play usually\ntakes the form of mock-aggression such as chasing, wrestling, biting,\nand tickling. According to many ethologists, mock-aggression was the\nearliest form of play, from which all other play developed (Aldis\n1975, 139; Panksepp 1993, 150). In mock-aggressive play, it is\ncritical that all participants are aware that the activity is not real\naggression. Without a way to distinguish between being chased or\nbitten playfully and being attacked in earnest, an animal\nmight respond with deadly force. In the anthropoid apes, play signals\nare visual and auditory. Jan van Hooff (1972, 212\u2013213) and\nothers speculate that the first play signals in humans evolved from\ntwo facial displays in an ancestor of both humans and the great apes\nthat are still found in gorillas and chimps. One was the \u201cgrin\nface\u201d or \u201csocial grimace\u201d: the corners of the mouth\nand the lips are retracted to expose the gums, the jaws are closed,\nthere is no vocalization, body movement is inhibited, and the eyes are\ndirected toward an interacting partner. This \u201csilent bared-teeth\ndisplay,\u201d according to van Hooff (1972, 217), evolved into the\nhuman social smile of appeasement. \n\nIn the other facial display, the lips are relaxed and the mouth open,\nand breathing is shallow and staccato, like panting. This vocalization\nin chimpanzees is on the in-breath: \u201cAhh ahh ahh.\u201d\nAccording to van Hooff, this \u201crelaxed open-mouth display\u201d\nor \u201cplay face\u201d evolved into human laughter. The relaxed\nmouth in laughter contrasts with the mouth in real aggression that is\ntense and prepared to bite hard. That difference, combined with the\ndistinctive shallow, staccato breathing pattern, allows laughter to\nserve as a play signal, announcing that \u201cThis is just for fun;\nit\u2019s not real fighting.\u201d Chimps and gorillas show that\nface and vocalization during rough-and-tumble play, and it can be\nelicited in them by the playful grabbing and poking we call tickling\n(Andrew 1963). \n\nAs early hominin species began walking upright and the front limbs\nwere no longer used for locomotion, the muscles in the chest no longer\nhad to synchronize breathing with locomotion. The larynx moved to a\nlower position in the throat, and the pharynx developed, allowing\nearly humans to modulate their breathing and vocalize in complex ways\n(Harris 1989, 77). Eventually they would speak, but before that they\ncame to laugh in our human way: \u201cha ha ha\u201d on the\nout-breath instead of \u201cahh ahh ahh\u201d on the in-breath.\n\nIn the last decade, thinkers in evolutionary psychology have extended\nvan Hooff\u2019s work, relating humor to such things as sexual\nselection (Greengross 2008; Li et al. 2009). In the competition for\nwomen to mate with, early men may have engaged in humor to show their\nintelligence, cleverness, adaptability, and desire to please\nothers.\n\nThe hypothesis that laughter evolved as a play signal is appealing in\nseveral ways. Unlike the Superiority and Incongruity Theories, it\nexplains the link between humor and the facial expression, body\nlanguage, and sound of laughter. It also explains why laughter is\noverwhelmingly a social experience, as those theories do not.\nAccording to one estimate, we are thirty times more likely to laugh\nwith other people than when we are alone (Provine 2000, 45). Tracing\nlaughter to a play signal in early humans also accords with the fact\nthat young children today laugh during the same\nactivities\u2014chasing, wrestling, and tickling\u2014in which\nchimps and gorillas show their play face and laugh-like vocalizations.\nThe idea that laughter and humor evolved from mock-aggression,\nfurthermore, helps explain why so much humor today, especially in\nmales, is playfully aggressive. \n\nThe playful aggression found in much humor has been widely\nmisunderstood by philosophers, especially in discussions of the ethics\nof humor. Starting with Plato, most philosophers have treated humor\nthat represents people in a negative light as if it were real\naggression toward those people. Jokes in which blondes or Poles are\nextraordinarily stupid, blacks extraordinarily lazy, Italians\nextraordinarily cowardly, lawyers extraordinarily self-centered, women\nextraordinarily unmathematical, etc. have usually been analyzed as if\nthey were bona fide assertions that blondes or Poles are\nextraordinarily stupid, blacks extraordinarily lazy, etc. This\napproach is announced in the title of Michael Philips\u2019\n\u201cRacist Acts and Racist Humor\u201d(1984). Philips classifies\nPolish jokes as racist, for example, but anyone who understands their\npopularity in the 1960s, knows that they did not involve hostility\ntoward Polish people, who had long been assimilated into North\nAmerican society. Consider the joke about the Polish astronaut calling\na press conference to announce that he was going to fly a rocket to\nthe sun. When asked how he would deal with the sun\u2019s intense heat,\nhe said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go at night.\u201d To\nenjoy this joke, it is not necessary to have racist beliefs or\nattitudes towards Poles, any more than it is necessary to believe that\nPoland has a space program. This is a fantasy enjoyed for its clever\ndepiction of unbelievable stupidity. \n\nWhile playing with negative stereotypes in jokes does not require\nendorsement of those stereotypes, however, it still keeps them in\ncirculation, and that can be harmful in a racist or sexist culture\nwhere stereotypes support prejudice and injustice. Jokes can be\nmorally objectionable for perpetuating stereotypes that need to be\neliminated. More generally, humor can be morally objectionable when it\ntreats as a subject for play something that should be taken seriously.\n(Morreall 2009, ch. 5). Here humor often blocks compassion and\nresponsible action. An egregious example is the cover of the July 1974\nNational Lampoon magazine, titled the \u201cDessert\nIssue.\u201d A few years earlier George Harrison and other musicians\nhad organized a charity concert to benefit the victims of a famine in\nBangladesh. From it they produced the record album  Concert for\nBangladesh. The album cover featured a photograph of a starving\nchild with a begging bowl. The photo on the cover of National\nLampoon\u2019s \u201cDessert Issue\u201d was virtually the\nsame, only it was of a chocolate sculpture of a starving\nchild, with part of the head bitten off. \n\nHaving sketched an account of humor as play with words and ideas, we\nneed to go further in order to counter the Irrationality Objection,\nespecially since that play is based on violating mental patterns and\nexpectations. What must be added is an explanation of how playfully\nviolating mental patterns and expectations could foster rationality\nrather than undermine it. \n\nPart of rationality is thinking abstractly\u2014in a way that is not\ntied to one\u2019s immediate experience and individual perspective.\nIf at a dinner party I spill a blob of ketchup on my shirt that looks\nlike a bullet hole, I could be locked into a Here/Now/Me/Practical\nmode in which I think only about myself and my soiled shirt. Or I\ncould think about embarrassing moments like this as experienced by\nmillions of people over the centuries. More abstract still would be to\nthink, as the Buddha did, about how human life is full of\nproblems.\n\nIn the lower animals, mental processing is not abstract but tied to\npresent experience, needs, and opportunities. It is about nearby\npredators, food, mates, etc. When something violates their\nexpectations, especially something involving a potential or actual\nloss, their typical reaction is fear, anger, disgust, or sadness. These\nemotions evolved in mammals and were useful for millions of years\nbecause they motivate adaptive behavior such as fighting, fleeing, avoiding noxious substances, withdrawing from activity, and avoiding similar situations in the\nfuture.\n\nFear, anger, disgust, and sadness are still sometimes adaptive in humans: A\nsnarling dog scares us, for example, and we move away quickly,\navoiding a nasty bite. We scream and poke the eyes of a mugger, and he runs off. But if human mental development had not gone\nbeyond such emotions, with their Here/Now/Me/Practical focus, we would\nnot have become rational animals. What early humans needed was a way\nto react to the violation of their expectations that transcended their\nimmediate experience and their individual perspective. Humorous\namusement provided that. In the humorous frame of mind, we experience,\nthink about, or even create something that violates our understanding\nof how things are supposed to be. But we suspend the personal,\npractical concerns that lead to negative emotions, and enjoy the\noddness of what is occurring. If the incongruous situation is our own\nfailure or mistake, we view it in the way we view the failures and\nmistakes of other people. This perspective is more abstract,\nobjective, and rational than an emotional perspective. As the theme\nsong of the old Candid Camera television program used to say, we\n\u201csee ourselves as other people do.\u201d Instead of tensing up\nand preparing to run away or attack, we relax and laugh. In laughter,\nas Wallace Chafe said in The Importance of Not Being Earnest\n(2007), not only do we not do anything, but we are disabled as we lose\nmuscle control in our torsos, arms, and legs. In extremely heavy\nlaughter, we fall on the floor and wet our pants. \n\nThe nonpractical attitude in humor would not be beneficial, of course,\nif I were in imminent danger. If instead of ketchup, I spilled\nsulfuric acid on my shirt, the Here/Now/Me/Practical narrow focus of\nfear would be preferable to the disengaged, playful attitude of humor.\nWhen immediate action is called for, humor is no substitute. But in\nmany situations where our expectations are violated, no action would\nhelp. In the Poetics (5, 1449a) Aristotle said that what is\nfunny is \u201ca mistake or unseemliness that is not painful or\ndestructive.\u201d But people have joked about problems as grave as\ntheir own impending death. As he approached the gallows, Thomas More\nasked the executioner, \u201cCould you help me up. I\u2019ll be able\nto get down by myself.\u201d On his deathbed, the story goes, Oscar\nWilde said: \u201cThis wallpaper is atrocious. One of us has to\ngo.\u201d\n\nNot only does such joking foster rationality and provide pleasure, but\nit reduces or eliminates the combination of fear and/or anger called\n\u201cstress,\u201d which is at epidemic levels in the\nindustrialized world. In fear and anger, chemicals such as\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol are released into the blood,\ncausing an increase in muscle tension, heart rate, and blood pressure,\nand a suppression of the immune system. Those physiological changes\nevolved in earlier mammals as a way to energize them to fight or flee,\nand in early humans, they were usually responses to physical dangers\nsuch as predators or enemies. Today, however, our bodies and brains\nreact in the same way to problems that are not physically threatening,\nsuch as overbearing bosses and work deadlines. The increased muscle\ntension, the spike in blood pressure, and other changes in stress not\nonly do not help us with such problems, but cause new ones such as\nheadaches, heart attacks, and cancer. When in potentially stressful situations\nwe shift to the play mode of humor, our heart rate, blood pressure,\nand muscle tension decrease, as do levels of epinephrine,\nnorepinephrine, and cortisol. Laughter also increases pain tolerance\nand boosts the activity of the immune system, which stress suppresses\n(Morreall 1997, ch. 4; Morreall 2016, ch. 5\u20136). \n\nA century ago, when psychologists still talked like philosophers, an\neditorial in the American Journal of Psychology (October\n1907) said of humor that \u201cPerhaps its largest function is to\ndetach us from our world of good and evil, of loss and gain, and to\nenable us to see it in proper perspective. It frees us from vanity, on\nthe one hand, and from pessimism, on the other, by keeping us larger\nthan what we do, and greater than what can happen to us.\u201d\n6. Comedy\n\nWhile there is only speculation about how humor developed in early\nhumans, we know that by the late 6th century BCE the Greeks\nhad institutionalized it in the ritual known as comedy, and that it\nwas performed with a contrasting dramatic form known as tragedy. Both\nwere based on the violation of mental patterns and expectations, and\nin both the world is a tangle of conflicting systems where humans live\nin the shadow of failure, folly, and death. Like tragedy, comedy\nrepresents life as full of tension, danger, and struggle, with success\nor failure often depending on chance factors. Where they differ is in\nthe responses of the lead characters to life\u2019s incongruities.\nIdentifying with these characters, audiences at comedies and tragedies\nhave contrasting responses to events in the dramas. And because these\nresponses carry over to similar situations in life, comedy and tragedy\nembody contrasting responses to the incongruities in life. (Morreall 1999, ch. 1\u20134). \n\nTragedy valorizes serious, emotional engagement with life\u2019s\nproblems, even struggle to the death. Along with epic, it is part of\nthe Western heroic tradition that extols ideals, the willingness to\nfight for them, and honor. The tragic ethos is linked to patriarchy\nand militarism\u2014many of its heroes are kings and\nconquerors\u2014and it valorizes what Conrad Hyers (1996) calls\nWarrior Virtues\u2014blind obedience, the willingness to kill or die\non command, unquestioning loyalty, single-mindedness, resoluteness of\npurpose, and pride. \n\nComedy, by contrast, embodies an anti-heroic, pragmatic attitude\ntoward life\u2019s incongruities. From Aristophanes\u2019\nLysistrata to Charlie Chaplin\u2019s The Great\nDictator to Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11,\ncomedy has mocked the irrationality of militarism and blind respect\nfor authority. Its own methods of handling conflict include\ndeal-making, trickery, getting an enemy drunk, and running away. As\nthe Irish saying goes, you\u2019re only a coward for a moment, but\nyou\u2019re dead for the rest of your life. In place of Warrior\nVirtues, it extols critical thinking, cleverness, adaptability, and an\nappreciation of physical pleasures like eating, drinking, and sex.\n\n\nAlong with the idealism of tragedy goes elitism. The people who matter\nare kings, queens, and generals. In comedy there are more characters\nand more kinds of characters, women are more prominent, and many\nprotagonists come from lower classes. Everybody counts for one. That\nshows in the language of comedy, which, unlike the elevated language\nof tragedy, is common speech. The basic unit in tragedy is the\nindividual, in comedy it is the family, group of friends, or bunch of\nco-workers.\n\nWhile tragic heroes are emotionally engaged with their problems, comic\nprotagonists show emotional disengagement. They think, rather than\nfeel, their way through difficulties. By presenting such characters as\nrole models, comedy has implicitly valorized the benefits of humor\nthat are now being empirically verified, such as that it is\npsychologically and physically healthy, it fosters mental flexibility,\nand it serves as a social lubricant. With a few exceptions like\nAquinas, philosophers have ignored these benefits.\n\nIf philosophers wanted to undo the traditional prejudices against\nhumor, they might consider the affinities between one contemporary\ngenre of comedy\u2014standup comedy\u2014and philosophy itself.\nThere are at least seven. (Morreall 2009, ch. 7). First, standup comedy and philosophy are\nconversational: like the dialogue format that started with Plato,\nstandup routines are interactive. Second, both reflect on familiar\nexperiences, especially puzzling ones. We wake from a vivid dream, for\nexample, not sure what has happened and what is happening. Third, like\nphilosophers, standup comics often approach puzzling experiences with\nquestions. \u201cIf I thought that dream was real, how do I know that\nI\u2019m not dreaming right now?\u201d The most basic starting point\nin both philosophy and standup comedy is \u201cX\u2014what\u2019s\nup with that?\u201d Fourth, as they think about familiar\nexperiences, both philosophers and comics step back emotionally from\nthem. Henri Bergson (1900 [1911]) spoke of the \u201cmomentary\nanesthesia of the heart\u201d in laughter. Emotional disengagement\nlong ago became a meaning of\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d\u2014\u201crational, sensibly composed,\ncalm, as in a difficult situation.\u201d Fifth, philosophers and\nstandup comics think critically. They ask whether familiar ideas make\nsense, and they refuse to defer to authority and tradition. It was for\nhis critical thinking that Socrates was executed. So were cabaret\ncomics in Germany who mocked the Third Reich. Sixth, in thinking\ncritically, philosophers and standup comics pay careful attention to\nlanguage. Attacking sloppy and illogical uses of words is standard in\nboth, and so is finding exactly the right words to express an idea.\nSeventh, the pleasure of standup comedy is often like the pleasure of\ndoing philosophy. In both we relish new ways of looking at things and\ndelight in surprising thoughts. Cleverness is prized. William James\n(1911 [1979], 11) said that philosophy \u201csees the familiar as if\nit were strange, and the strange as if it were familiar.\u201d The\nsame is true of standup comedy. Simon Critchley has written that both\nask us to \u201clook at things as if you had just landed from another\nplanet\u201d (2002, 1).\n\nOne recent philosopher attuned to the affinity between comedy and\nphilosophy was Bertrand Russell. \u201cThe point of\nphilosophy,\u201d he said, \u201cis to start with something so\nsimple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so\nparadoxical that no one will believe it\u201d (1918, 53). In the\nmiddle of an argument, he once observed, \u201cThis seems plainly\nabsurd: but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to\nbe frightened by absurdities\u201d (2008 [1912], 17).\n\nOften writing for popular audiences, Russell had many quips that would\nfit nicely into a comedy routine:\n\nThe fundamental cause of trouble is that in the modern world the\nstupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt\u201c\n(1998, 28). \nMost people would die sooner than think\u2014in fact they do\nso\u201d (1925a, 166).\nMan is a rational animal\u2014so at least I have been told.\nThroughout a long life, I have looked diligently for evidence in favor\nof this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come\nacross it, though I have searched in many countries spread over three\ncontinents\u201c (1950, 71). \nMathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know\nwhat we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is\ntrue\u201d (1925b, 75).\n\n\nFor more examples of the affinities between comedy and philosophy,\nthere is a series of books on philosophy and popular culture from Open\nCourt Publishing that includes: Seinfeld and Philosophy\n(2002), The Simpsons and Philosophy (2001), Woody Allen\nand Philosophy (2004), and Monty Python and Philosophy\n(2006). Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein have written Plato and\na Platypus Walked into a Bar \u2026 : Understanding Philosophy through\nJokes (2008), and Heidegger and a Hippo Walk Through Those\nPearly Gates: Using Philosophy (and Jokes!) to Explore Life, Death,\nthe Afterlife, and Everything in Between (2009). In philosophy of\nmind, Matthew Hurley, Daniel Dennett, and Reginald Adams (2011) have\nused humor to explain the development of the human mind. In\naesthetics, No\u00ebl Carroll (1999, 2003, 2007, 2013) has written\nabout philosophical implications of comedy and humor, and about their\nrelationships with the genre of horror. The journals Philosophy\nEast and West (1989), the Monist (2005), and\nEducational Philosophy and Theory (2014) have published\nspecial issues on humor. The ancient prejudices against humor that\nstarted with Plato are finally starting to crumble.\n",
