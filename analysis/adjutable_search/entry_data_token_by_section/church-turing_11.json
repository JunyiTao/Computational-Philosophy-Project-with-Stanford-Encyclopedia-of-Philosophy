    "main_text": "Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of effective method and decision method || Logic machines\n2.3 Logic machines\n\nThe modern concept of a decision method for a logical calculus did not\ndevelop until the twentieth century. But earlier logicians, including\nLeibniz, certainly had the concept of a method that is\nmechanical in the literal sense that it could be carried out\nby a machine constructed from mechanical components of the sort\nfamiliar to them\u2014discs, pins, rods, springs, levers, pulleys,\nrotating shafts, gear wheels, weights, dials, mechanical switches,\nslotted plates, and so forth.\n\nIn 1869, Jevons designed a pioneering machine known as the\n\u201clogic piano\u201d (Jevons 1870; Barrett & Connell 2005).\nThe name arose because of the machine\u2019s piano-like keyboard for\ninputting logical formulae. The formulae were drawn from a syllogistic\ncalculus involving four positive terms, such as \u201ciron\u201d and\n\u201cmetal\u201d (Jevons 1870). Turing\u2019s colleague Mays, who\nhimself designed an influential electrical logic machine (Mays &\nPrinz 1950), described the logic piano as \u201cthe first working\nmachine to perform logical inference without the intervention of human\nagency\u201d (Mays & Henry 1951: 4).\n\nThe logic piano implemented a method for determining which\ncombinations drawn from eight terms\u2014the four positive terms and\nthe corresponding four negated terms (\u201cnon-metal\u201d,\netc.)\u2014were consistent with the inputted formulae and which not\n(although in fact not all consistent combinations were taken into\naccount). The machine displayed the consistent formulae by means of\nlettered strips of wood, with upper-case letters representing positive\nterms and lower-case negative. Jevons exhibited the logic piano in\nManchester at Owens College, now Manchester University, where he was\nprofessor of logic (Mays & Henry 1953: 503). His piano, Jevons\nclaimed with considerable exaggeration, made it \u201cevident that\nmechanism is capable of replacing for the most part the action of\nthought required in the performance of logical deduction\u201d\n(Jevons 1870: 517).\n\nA decade later, Venn published the technique we now call Venn\ndiagrams (Venn 1880). This technique satisfies the four criteria\nset out for an effective method in\n Section 1.\n The user first diagrams the premisses of a syllogism and then, as\nQuine put it, \u201cwe inspect the diagram to see whether the content\nof the conclusion has automatically appeared in the diagram as a\nresult\u201d (Quine 1950: 74). Not all formulae of the functional\ncalculus are Venn-diagrammable, and Venn\u2019s original method is\nlimited to testing syllogisms. In the twentieth century, Massey showed\nthat Venn\u2019s method can be stretched to give a decision procedure\nfor the monadic functional calculus (Massey 1966).\n\nVenn, like Jevons, was well aware of the concept of a literally\nmechanical method. He pointed out that diagrammatic methods such as\nhis \u201creadily lend themselves to mechanical performance\u201d\n(Venn 1880: 15). Venn went on to describe what he called a\n\u201clogical-diagram machine\u201d. This simple machine displayed\nwooden segments corresponding to the component areas of a Venn\ndiagram; each wooden segment represented one of four terms. A\nfinger-operated release mechanism allowed any segment selected by the\nuser to drop downwards. This represented \u201cthe destruction of any\nclass\u201d (1880: 18). Venn reported that he constructed this\nmachine, which measured \u201cbetween five and six inches square and\nthree inches deep\u201d (1880: 17). When Venn published his\ndescription of it, Jevons quickly wrote to him saying that the\nlogical-diagram machine \u201cis exceedingly ingenious & seems to\nrepresent the relations of four terms very well\u201d (Jevons 1880).\nVenn himself however was less enthusiastic, saying in his article\n\u201cI have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of\nwhat are sometimes called logical machines\u201d (1880: 15). Baldwin,\ncommenting on Venn\u2019s machine in 1902, complained that it was\n\u201cmerely a more cumbersome diagram\u201d (1902: 29). This is\nquite true\u2014it would be at least as easy to draw the Venn diagram\non paper as to set it up on the machine. But Venn\u2019s article made\nit very plain that the logical-diagram machine was intended to be a\nhilarious send-up of Jevons\u2019 complicated logic piano.\n\nAt around the same time, Marquand\u2014a student of\nPeirce\u2019s\u2014designed a logic machine which a Princeton\ncolleague then built (out of wood salvaged from\n\u201cPrinceton\u2019s oldest homestead\u201d, Marquand related in\nhis 1885). Marquand knew of Jevons\u2019 and Venn\u2019s designs,\nand said he had \u201cfollowed Jevons\u201d in certain respects, and\nthat his own machine was \u201csomewhat similar\u201d to\nJevons\u2019 (Marquand 1881, 1883: 16, 1885: 303). Peirce, with\ncustomary bluntness, called Marquand\u2019s machine \u201ca vastly\nmore clear-headed contrivance than that of Jevons\u201d (Peirce 1887:\n166). Again limited to a syllogistic calculus involving only four\npositive terms, Marquand\u2019s device, like Jevons\u2019, displayed\nterm-combinations consistent with the inputted formulae. A lettered\nplate with sixteen mechanical dials was used to display the\ncombinations.\n",
