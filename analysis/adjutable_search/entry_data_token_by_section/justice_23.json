    "main_text": "Egalitarianism and Justice || Justice as Equality\n6.1 Justice as Equality\n\nSo we need to ask about the circumstances in which justice requires a\nsubstantively equal distribution of advantages. One rather obvious\ncase occurs when the members of the group within which the\ndistribution is going to occur have no relevant distinguishing\nfeatures, so there are no grounds on which some can claim greater\nshares of benefit than others. Suppose a group experiences a windfall\ngain for which no-one can claim any credit: a pot of gold somehow\nappears in their midst. Then unless any member can make a\njustice-related claim for a larger-than-equal share \u2013 say that\nshe has special needs that she lacks sufficient resources to meet\n\u2013 an equal distribution of the gold is what justice demands,\nsince any other distribution would be arbitrary. Equality here is the\ndefault principle that applies in the absence of any special claims\nthat can be presented as reasons of justice.\n\nEquality also acts as a default in circumstances where, although\npeople may indeed have unequal claims to whatever good is being\ndistributed, we have no reliable way of identifying and measuring\nthose claims. By sharing the good equally, we can at least ensure that\nevery claim has been partially satisfied. Thus suppose we have limited\nsupplies of a drug that can treat malaria, and a number of patients\ndisplaying symptoms of the disease, but lacking specialised medical\nknowledge we cannot tell whether one person\u2019s condition is more\nserious than another\u2019s; then by sharing out the drug equally, we\ncan guarantee that each person at least receives the highest fraction\nof what they really need. Any other distribution must leave at least\none person with less (this of course assumes that there is no\nthreshold amount of the drug beneath which it is ineffective; if that\nassumption is wrong, justice under the stated conditions might require\na lottery in which the chosen ones receive threshold-size doses).\n\nIf justice requires equality only by default, it might seem to apply\nonly in a narrow range of cases. How could egalitarian justice be made\nmore robust? One approach involves declaring a wider range of factors\nirrelevant to just distribution. Thus one formulation of the principle\nholds that no-one should be worse-off than anyone else as a result of\ntheir \u2018morally arbitrary\u2019 characteristics, where a\ncharacteristic is morally arbitrary when its possessor cannot claim\ncredit for having it. This captures a widespread intuition that people\nshould not be advantaged or disadvantaged by virtue of their race or\ngender, but extends it (more controversially) to all personal features\nwith a genetic basis, such as natural talents and inborn dispositions.\nIn doing so, it discounts most claims of desert, since when people are\nsaid to deserve benefits of various kinds, it is usually for\nperforming actions or displaying qualities that depend upon innate\ncharacteristics such as strength or intelligence. In the following\nsection, we will see how egalitarian theories of justice have tried to\nincorporate some desert-like elements by way of response. But\notherwise justice as equality and justice as desert appear to be in\nconflict, and the challenge is to show what can justify equal\ntreatment in the face of inequalities of desert.\n\nA second approach answers this challenge by explaining why it is\npositively valuable to afford people equal treatment even if they do\ndisplay features that might appear to justify differential treatment.\nA prominent advocate of this approach is Dworkin, who argues that\nfundamental to justice is a principle of equal concern and respect for\npersons, and what this means in more concrete term is that equal\nresources should be devoted to the life of each member of society\n(Dworkin 2000). (The reference to membership here is not redundant,\nbecause Dworkin understands egalitarian justice as a principle that\nmust be applied within sovereign states specifically \u2013 so in the\nterms of 3.2, this is a relational view of justice.) The thought is\nthat showing persons equal respect may sometimes require us to afford\nthem equal treatment, even in the face of relevant grounds for\ndiscrimination. Thus we insist on political equality \u2013 one\nperson, one vote \u2013 even though we know that there are quite\nlarge differences in people\u2019s competence to make political\ndecisions.\n",
