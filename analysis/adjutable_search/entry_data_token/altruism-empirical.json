Some Philosophical Background\n\nPeople often behave in ways that benefit others, and they sometimes do\nthis knowing that it will be costly, unpleasant or dangerous. But at\nleast since Plato\u2019s classic discussion in the second Book of the\nRepublic, debate has raged over why people behave in\nthis way. Are their motives really altruistic, or is their\nbehavior ultimately motivated by self-interest? Famously, Hobbes gave\nthis answer:\n\n\nNo man giveth but with intention of good to himself, because gift is\nvoluntary; and of all voluntary acts, the object is to every man his\nown good; of which, if men see they shall be frustrated, there will be\nno beginning of benevolence or trust, nor consequently of mutual help.\n(1651 [1981]: Ch. 15)\n\n\nViews like Hobbes\u2019 have come to be called\n egoism,[1]\n and this rather depressing conception of human motivation has\napparently been favored, in one form or another, by a number of\neminent philosophical advocates, including Bentham, J.S. Mill and\n Nietzsche.[2]\n Egoism was also arguably the dominant view about human motivation in\nthe social sciences for much of the twentieth century (Piliavin &\nCharng 1990: 28; Grant 1997). Dissenting voices, though perhaps fewer\nin number, have been no less eminent. Butler, Hume, Rousseau, and Adam\nSmith have all argued that, sometimes at least, human motivation is\ngenuinely altruistic.\n\nThough the issue dividing egoistic and altruistic accounts of human\nmotivation is largely empirical, it is easy to see why philosophers\nhave thought that the competing answers will have important\nconsequences for moral theory. For example, Kant famously argued that\na person should act \u201cnot from inclination but from duty, and by\nthis would his conduct first acquire true moral worth\u201d (1785\n[1949]: Sec. 1, parag. 12). But egoism maintains that all\nhuman motivation is ultimately self-interested, and thus people\ncan\u2019t act \u201cfrom duty\u201d in the way that Kant\nurged. Thus if egoism is true, Kant\u2019s account would entail that\nno conduct has \u201ctrue moral worth\u201d. Additionally, if egoism\nis true, it would appear to impose a strong constraint on how a moral\ntheory can answer the venerable question \u201cWhy should I be\nmoral?\u201d since, as Hobbes clearly saw, the answer will have to\nground the motivation to be moral in the agent\u2019s\nself-interest.\n\nThere are related implications for political philosophy. If the\negoists are right, then the only way to motivate prosocial\nbehavior is to give people a selfish reason for engaging in such\nbehavior, and this constrains the design of political institutions\nintended to encourage civic-minded behavior. John Stuart Mill, who was\nboth a utilitarian and an egoist, advocated a variety of manipulative\nsocial interventions to engender conformity with utilitarian moral\nstandards from egoistic moral\n agents.[3]\n\nIt is easy to find philosophers suggesting that altruism is required\nfor morality or that egoism is incompatible with morality\u2014and\neasier still to find philosophers who claim that other\nphilosophers think this. Here are a few examples culled from a\nstandard reference work that happened to be close at hand:\n\n\nMoral behavior is, at the most general level, altruistic behavior,\nmotivated by the desire to promote not only our own welfare but the\nwelfare of others. (Rachels 2000: 81)\n\n[O]ne central assumption motivating ethical theory in the Analytic\ntradition is that the function of ethics is to combat the inherent\negoism or selfishness of individuals. Indeed, many thinkers define the\nbasic goal of morality as \u201cselflessness\u201d or\n\u201caltruism\u201d. (W. Schroeder 2000: 396)\n\nPhilosophers since Socrates worried that humans might be capable of\nacting only to promote their own self-interest. But if that is all we\ncan do, then it seems morality is impossible. (LaFollette 2000a: 5)\n [4]\n\n\nWhile the egoism/altruism debate has historically been of great\nphilosophical interest, the issue centrally concerns psychological\nquestions about the nature of human motivation, so it\u2019s no\nsurprise that psychologists have done a great deal of empirical\nresearch aimed at determining which view is correct. The psychological\nliterature will be center-stage in\n section 5,\n the longest section in this entry, and in\n section 6.\n But before considering the empirical literature, it is important to be clear \non what the debate is about.\n2. Defining \u201cEgoism\u201d and \u201cAltruism\u201d\u2014The Standard Account\n\nProviding definitions for \u201cegoism\u201d and\n\u201caltruism\u201d is a contentious matter, since these terms have\nbeen understood in radically different ways both in philosophy and in\nthe biological and social sciences. In this entry the focus will be on\nthe most widespread interpretation of\n\u201cegoism\u201d and \u201caltruism\u201d, understood as\ndescriptive claims about human psychology, within philosophy.\nWe\u2019ll call it \u201cthe standard account\u201d, versions of\nwhich have been offered by numerous authors including Broad (1950),\nFeinberg (1965 [1999]), Sober and Wilson (1998: Chs. 6 & 7),\nRachels (2003: Ch. 6), Joyce (2006: Ch. 1), Kitcher (2010, 2011: Ch.\n1), May (2011a), and many others. Not surprisingly, there are minor\ndifferences among the accounts provided by these authors, and those\ndifferences occasionally provoke disagreement in the literature. But\nall of them bear a strong family resemblance to the one we\u2019re\nabout to\n sketch.[5]\n\n\nAt the end of this section, a different account of altruism proposed\nin philosophy is briefly discussed. Biological accounts of altruism\nwill be considered in\n section 3,\n and accounts proposed by social scientists will be discussed in\n section 4.\n But our present focus is the standard philosophical account. \n\nAs already intimated, while advocates of altruism and of\negoism agree that people often help others, they disagree about\nwhy they do this. On the standard account, defenders of\naltruism insist that, sometimes at least, people are motivated by an\nultimate desire for the well-being of another person, while defenders\nof egoism maintain that all ultimate desires are self-interested. This\nformulation invites questions about (1) what it is for a behavior to\nbe motivated by an ultimate desire, and (2) the distinction\nbetween desires that are self-interested and desires for\nthe well-being of others.\n\nThe first question, regarding ultimate desires, can be usefully\nexplicated with the help of a familiar account of practical\n reasoning.[6]\n On this account, practical reasoning is a causal process via which a\ndesire and a belief give rise to or sustain another desire. For\nexample, a desire to drink an espresso and a belief that the best\nplace to get an espresso is at the espresso bar on Main Street may\ncause a desire to go to the espresso bar on Main Street. This desire\ncan then join forces with another belief to generate a third desire,\nand so on. Sometimes this process will lead to a desire to perform a\nrelatively simple or \u201cbasic\u201d action, and that desire, in\nturn, will cause the agent to perform the basic action without the\nintervention of any further desires. Desires produced or sustained by\nthis process of practical reasoning are instrumental\ndesires\u2014the agent has them because she thinks that satisfying\nthem will lead to something else that she desires. But not\nall desires can be instrumental desires. If we are to avoid\ncircularity or an infinite regress there must be some desires that are\nnot produced because the agent thinks that satisfying them\nwill facilitate satisfying some other desire. These desires that are\nnot produced or sustained by practical reasoning are the agent\u2019s\nultimate desires, and the objects of ultimate\ndesires\u2014the states of affairs desired\u2014are often said to be\ndesired \u201cfor their own sake\u201d. A behavior is\nmotivated by a specific ultimate desire when that desire is\npart of the practical reasoning process that leads to the\nbehavior.\n\nAlthough the second question, about the distinction between\nself-interested desires and desires for the well-being of others,\nwould require an extended discussion in any comprehensive treatment of\nthe debate between egoists and altruists, some rough and ready\nexamples of the distinction will suffice\n here.[7]\n The desires that another person\u2019s life be saved, that another\nperson\u2019s suffering be alleviated, or that another person be\nhappy are paradigm cases of desires for the well-being of others,\nwhile desires to experience pleasure, get rich, and become famous are\ntypical examples of self-interested desires. The self-interested\ndesires to experience pleasure and to avoid pain have played an\nespecially prominent role in the debate, since one version of egoism,\noften called hedonism, maintains that these are our\nonly ultimate desires. Stich et al. (2010) maintain that some\ndesires, like the desire that I myself be the one to\nalleviate my friend\u2019s suffering, are hard to classify, and\nconclude that both egoism and altruism are best viewed as somewhat\n vague.[8]\n\n\nWhether or not this is correct, it is clear that there are\nmany desires that are neither self-interested nor\ndesires for the well-being of others. One of the earliest examples was\nprovided by Bishop Joseph Butler (1726 [1887]) who noted that revenge\noften engenders malevolent desires, like the desire that another\nperson be harmed, which are obviously not desires for the well-being\nof the that person, and are not self-interested\n either.[9]\n Other examples include the desire that great works of art be\npreserved and the desire that space exploration be pursued. More\ninteresting for moral theory are the desire to do one\u2019s moral\nduty, and the desire to obey God\u2019s commandments. If people have\nultimate desires like these, then egoism is false. But, of\ncourse, the existence of ultimate desires like these would not show\nthat altruism is true. The take-away from such cases is that on the\nstandard account, egoism and altruism might both be\nmistaken.\n\nThough interpretations of \u201caltruism\u201d in the standard\naccount family predominate in the philosophical literature, some\nphilosophers use the term in a very different way. A paper by Thomas\nSchramme (2017) provides a clear example.\n\n\n[A]ltruism need not be reduced to its opposition to egoism. In this\nchapter, altruism is discussed as a psychological basis for moral\nconduct more generally, not just in terms of motivations to benefit\nothers. Here altruism stands for the capacity to take the\nmoral point of view and be disposed to act accordingly\u2026. Seen\nin this way, altruism is a short word for the psychological phenomenon\nof the internalized pull of morality\u2026 (2017: 203\u2013204).\n\n\nAltruism is then basically identical with taking the moral point of\nview, i.e., an individual appreciation of the normative force of\nmorality. (2017: 209).\n [10]\n\n\nSchramme is, of course, aware that many authors reject \u201csuch a\nclose connection of general moral motivation and altruistic\nmotivation\u201d but he maintains that this account of altruism\n\u201ccan certainly be found in the philosophical debate\u201d\n(2017: 209). Much the same claim is made by Badhwar (1993: 90):\n\nIn the moral philosophy of the last two centuries, altruism of one\nkind or another has typically been regarded as identical with moral\nconcern.\n\nSchramme is surely right that \n\n\n[t]he fact that we can understand altruism both as referring to moral\nbehavior quite generally and as restricted to a more specific set of\nhelping behaviors may lead to confusion. (2017: 204) \n\n\nThough some philosophers may believe there is a substantive dispute\nabout which account of altruism is correct, others think that\nthe issue is purely terminological. As noted earlier, the primary\nconcern in this entry is with what this entry dubs the \u201cstandard\naccount\u201d of altruism. But in the next two sections a number of\naccounts are considered that differ both from the standard account and\nfrom the account discussed by Schramme and Badhwar. \n3. Altruism and Evolution\n\nReaders familiar with some of the popular literature on the evolution\nof morality that has appeared in the last few decades might suspect\nthat recent work in evolutionary biology has resolved the debate\nbetween egoists and altruists. For some readers\u2014and some\nwriters\u2014seem to interpret evolutionary theory as showing that\naltruism is biologically impossible. If altruistic organisms were\nsomehow to emerge, this literature sometimes suggests, they would lose\nthe competition for survival and reproduction to their selfish\nconspecifics, and they would quickly become extinct. On this view, any\nappearance of altruism is simply an illusion. In the memorable words\nof biologist Michael Ghiselin (1974: 247) \u201cScratch an\n\u2018altruist\u2019 and watch a \u2018hypocrite\u2019\nbleed\u201d.\n\nBut as Sober and Wilson (1998) have argued with great clarity, there\nis no simple connection between evolutionary theory and the\nphilosophical debate between egoism and altruism. This is because the\nconcept of altruism that is important in evolutionary theory is quite\ndifferent from the standard concept of altruism invoked in the\nphilosophical debate. For biologists, an organism behaves\naltruistically if and only if the behavior in question reduces its own\nfitness while increasing the fitness of one or more other organisms.\nRoughly speaking, an organism\u2019s fitness is a measure of how many\ndescendants it will\n have.[11]\n As Sober and Wilson note, on this evolutionary account of altruism,\nan organism can be altruistic even if it does not have a mind capable\nof having beliefs and desires. Thus there can be no easy inference\nfrom biological altruism to psychological altruism. Nor does the\ninference go in the opposite direction. To make the point, Sober and\nWilson (Ch. 10) note that natural selection might well equip humans or\nother psychologically sophisticated organisms with ultimate desires to\nfoster the welfare of their offspring under certain circumstances.\nOrganisms with these ultimate desires would be psychological\naltruists, though the behavior that the desires gave rise to would\ntypically not be evolutionarily altruistic, since by\nhelping their offspring organisms typically are increasing their own\nfitness. So, contrary to the presumption that evolutionary biology has\nresolved the debate between egoists and altruists in favor of egoism,\nit appears that evolutionary theory little to offer that will support\nthat\n conclusion.[12]\n4. Altruism in the Social Sciences\n\nIn recent decades there has been an enormous amount of discussion of\naltruism in psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology and\nprimatology. Much of the work in psychology, including all of the work\nrecounted in\n section 5,\n has adopted the \u201cstandard account\u201d of altruism. But some\npsychologists, and many researchers in other disciplines, have\nsomething very different in mind. In a useful review of recent\ndiscussions of altruism, Clavien and Chapuisat lament the fact\nthat \n\n\n[t]he notion of altruism has become so plastic that it is often hard\nto understand what is really meant by the authors using the term, and\neven harder to evaluate the degree to which results from one research\nfield\u2014e.g., experimental economics\u2014may facilitate the\nresolution of debates in another research field\u2014e.g.,\nevolutionary biology or philosophy. (2013: 134) \n\n\nOne of the notions that Clavien and Chapuisat find playing a role in\nevolutionary anthropology, evolutionary game theory and experimental\neconomics is what they call \u201cpreference altruism\u201d.\n\u201cAn action is altruistic\u201d, in this sense, \u201cif it\nresults from preferences for improving others\u2019 interests and\nwelfare at some cost to oneself\u201d (2013: 131). Though the\nagent\u2019s psychology is relevant, on this account of altruism,\nthere is no mention of the agent\u2019s ultimate desires.\nThus an action can be preference altruistic even if the agent\u2019s\npreference for improving someone else\u2019s welfare is an\ninstrumental preference engendered by the belief that improving the\nrecipient\u2019s welfare will contribute to the agent\u2019s own\npleasure or treasure. \n\nA second, quite different, concept of altruism invoked in these\ndisciplines is what Clavien and Chapuisat call \u201cbehavioral\naltruism\u201d. On this interpretation of altruism, an agent\u2019s\npsychology plays no role in determining whether her action is\naltruistic. \n\n\nA behavior is altruistic if it brings any kind of benefit to other\nindividuals at some cost for the agent, and if there is no foreseeable\nway for the agent to reap compensatory benefits from her behavior.\n(2013: 131)\n\n\nRamsey (2016) makes a plausible case that some eminent primatologists\nand psychologists (including de Waal (2008) and Warneken and Tomasello\n(2008)) invoke an even less demanding account of altruism, one that\nrequires that the recipient benefit but drops the requirement that\naltruistic behavior must involve some cost to the agent. Ramsey labels\nthis notion \u201chelping altruism\u201d.\n\nCombining accounts from philosophy, biology and the social sciences,\nPiccinini and Schulz (2019) offer a multidimensional taxonomy for\ndifferent accounts of altruism, and argue that the distinctions they\ndraw are essential for assessing the moral status of different kinds\nof altruism. \n\nIn reviewing the many different ways in which the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d has been used in the empirical and\nphilosophical literature, it is hard to resist allusions to the\nbiblical Tower of Babel. But for the remainder of this entry, these\ninterpretations of \u201caltruism\u201d will be left behind. From\nhere on, the focus will be on altruism as it is understood in the\nstandard account.\n5. The Egoism vs. Altruism Debate in Psychology\n\nThe psychological literature relevant to the egoism vs.\naltruism debate is\n vast;[13]\n in the interests of a tolerable brevity, the entry will focus on the\nwork of Daniel Batson and his associates, who have done some of the\nmost influential and philosophically sophisticated work in this\narea.\n\nBatson, along with many other researchers, begins by borrowing an idea\nthat has deep roots in philosophical discussions of altruism. Though\nthe details and the terminology differ significantly from author to\nauthor, the core idea is that altruism is often the product of an\nemotional response to the distress of another person. Aquinas\n(1270 [1917]: II\u2013II, 30, 3), for example, maintains that \n\n\nmercy is the heartfelt sympathy for another\u2019s distress,\nimpelling us to succour him if we can. \n\n\nAnd Adam Smith (1759 [1853]: I, I, 1. 1) tells us that \n\n\npity or compassion [is] the emotion we feel for the misery of others,\nwhen we either see it, or are made to conceive it in a very lively\nmanner \n\n\nand these emotions \n\n\ninterest [man] in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness\nnecessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the\npleasure of seeing it.\n\n\nBatson (1991: 58) labels this response \u201cempathy\u201d which he\ncharacterizes as \u201can other-oriented emotional reaction to seeing\nsomeone suffer\u201d, and calls the traditional idea that empathy\nleads to altruism the empathy-altruism hypothesis. On\nBatson\u2019s account (1991: 86), empathy \n\n\nincludes feeling sympathetic, compassionate, warm, softhearted,\ntender, and the like, and according to the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis, it evokes altruistic motivation \n\n\nthough that motivation does not always lead to behavior. Batson (1991:\n117) contrasts empathy with a cluster of affective responses he calls\n\u201cpersonal distress\u201d which is \u201cmade up of more\nself-oriented feelings such as upset, alarm, anxiety, and\n distress\u201d.[14]\n\nIf the philosophical tradition that suggests the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis is on the right track, and Batson believes it is, one would\npredict that when people feel empathy they will desire to help those\nwho evoke the emotion, and thus be more inclined to engage in helping\nbehavior than people who do not feel empathy. This does not mean that\npeople will always engage in helping behavior when they feel\nempathy, since people may often have conflicting desires, and not all\nconflicts are resolved in favor of empathy\u2019s urgings. Nor does\nit mean that when people feel little or no empathy they will not\nengage in helping behavior, since the desire to help can also be\nproduced by a variety of processes in which empathy plays no role. But\nwe should expect that typically people feeling empathy will be more\nlikely to help than people who aren\u2019t feeling empathy, and the\nstronger their feelings of empathy the more likely it is that they\nwill engage in helping behavior.\n\nIn order to put this claim to empirical test, it is important to have\nways of inducing empathy in the laboratory, and there is a substantial\nbody of literature suggesting how this can be done. For example,\nStotland (1969) showed that subjects who were instructed to\nimagine how a specified person (often called \u201cthe\ntarget\u201d) felt when undergoing what subjects believed to\nbe a painful medical procedure reported stronger feelings of empathy\nand showed greater physiological arousal than subjects who were\ninstructed to watch the target person\u2019s\n movements.[15]\n Relatedly, Krebs (1975) demonstrated that subjects \nwho observe someone similar to themselves \nundergo painful experiences show more physiological\narousal, report identifying with the target more strongly, and report\nfeeling worse while waiting for the painful stimulus to begin than do\nsubjects who observe the same painful experiences administered to\nsomeone who is not similar to themselves. Krebs also showed that\nsubjects are more willing to help at some personal cost when the\nsufferer is similar to themselves. Batson (1991: 82\u201387) interprets\nthese findings as indicating that people are more inclined to feel\nempathy for those they believe to be similar to themselves, and thus\nthat empathy can often be induced by providing a person with evidence\nthat she and a target person are similar.\n\nTo make the case that empathy leads to helping behavior, Batson relies\nin part on work by others, including the just-cited Krebs (1975) study\nand a study by Dovidio et al. (1990). In that latter study,\nStotland\u2019s technique for manipulating empathy by instructing\nsubjects to take the perspective of the person in distress was used to\ninduce empathy for a young woman. Subjects focused on one of two quite\ndifferent problems that the young woman faced. When given an\nopportunity to help the young woman, subjects in whom empathy had been\nevoked were more likely to help than subjects in a low empathy\ncondition, and the increase in helping was specific to the problem\nthat had evoked the empathy.\n\nMany of Batson\u2019s own experiments, some of which are\ndescribed below, also support the contention that both spontaneously\nevoked empathy and empathy engendering experimental manipulations\nincrease the likelihood of helping behavior. Another important source\nof support for the link between empathy and helping behavior is a\nmeta-analysis of a large body of experimental literature by Eisenberg\nand Miller (1987) which found positive correlations between empathy\nand prosocial behavior in studies using a variety of techniques to\nassess empathy. On the basis of these and other findings, Batson\n(1991: 95) argues that \n\n\nthere is indeed an empathy-helping relationship; feeling empathy for a\nperson in need increases the likelihood of helping to relieve that\nneed.\n\n\nIt might be thought that establishing a causal link between empathy\nand helping behavior would be bad news for egoism. But, as Batson\nmakes clear, the fact that empathy leads to helping behavior does not\nresolve the dispute between egoism and altruism, since it does not\naddress the nature of the motivation for the helping behavior\nthat empathy evokes. One possibility is that empathy does indeed cause\na genuinely altruistic desire to help\u2014an ultimate desire for the\nwell-being of the sufferer. But there are also a variety of egoistic\nroutes by which empathy might lead to helping behavior. Perhaps the\nmost obvious of these is that empathy might simply be (or cause) an\nunpleasant experience, and that people are motivated to help because\nthey believe this is the best way to stop the unpleasant\nexperience that is caused by someone else\u2019s distress.\n\nQuite a different family of egoistic possibilities focus on the\nrewards to be expected for helping and/or the punishments to be\nexpected for withholding assistance. If people believe that others\nwill reward or sanction them for helping or failing to help in certain\ncircumstances, and that the feeling of empathy marks those cases in\nwhich social sanctions or rewards are most likely, then we would\nexpect people to be more helpful when they feel empathy, even if their\nultimate motivation is purely egoistic. A variation on this theme\nfocuses on rewards or punishments that are self-administered. If\npeople believe that helping may make them feel good, or that failing\nto help may make them feel bad, and that these feelings will be most\nlikely to occur in cases where they feel empathy, then once again we\nwould expect people who empathize to be more helpful, though their\nmotives may be not at all altruistic.\n\nDuring the last four decades, Batson and his collaborators have\nsystematically explored these egoistic hypotheses and many others.\nTheir strategy is to design experiments in which the altruistic\nexplanation of the link between empathy and helping can be compared to\none or another specific egoistic explanation. Reviewing all of these\nexperiments would require a far longer\n entry.[16]\n Instead the focus will be on two clusters of experiments that\nillustrate the potential philosophical rewards of designing and\ninterpreting experiments in this area, as well as some difficulties\nwith the project.\n5.1 The Social Punishment Hypothesis\n\nOne of the more popular egoist alternatives to the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis is the idea that people engage in helping behavior because\nthey fear that other people will punish them if they do not. If I\ndon\u2019t help, the actor is supposed to worry, people will be angry\nor they will think badly of me, and this may have negative effects on\nhow they treat me in the future. As it stands, this egoist hypothesis\ncan\u2019t explain the fact that empathy increases the likelihood of\nhelping, but a more sophisticated version is easy to construct by\nadding the assumption that people think social sanctions for not\nhelping are more likely when the target engenders empathy.\n\nTo test this hypothesis\u2014which Batson calls the socially\nadministered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\u2014against\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis, Batson and his associates (Fultz et\nal. 1986) designed an experiment in which they manipulated both the\nlevel of empathy that subjects felt for the target and the likelihood\nthat anyone would know whether or not the subject had opted to help a\nperson in need. Others can form a negative evaluation of your decision\nnot to help only if they know the choice you are facing and\nthe decision you have made; if your decision is secret, you need have\nno fear of social sanctions. Thus the socially administered\nempathy-specific punishment hypothesis predicts that subjects who\nexhibit high empathy on a given occasion will be more likely to help\nwhen they believe others will know if they fail to do so. On the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis, by contrast, high empathy subjects are\nmotivated by an ultimate desire to help, and thus their helping levels\nshould be high whether or not others would know if they decided not to\nhelp. In the low empathy condition, both hypotheses predict that\nlevels of helping will be low. These predictions are summarized in\nTables 1 and 2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Negative\nSocial Evaluation\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh\n\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\n\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Predictions About the Amount of\nHelping (Low or High) on the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis.\n\n\nSubjects in the experiment were told that they were participating in\nan impression formation study, and that they had been randomly\nassigned to the role of \u201clistener\u201d in which they would\nread confidential notes from another student participant, the\n\u201ccommunicator\u201d. They were given two notes from Janet\nArnold, an out-of-state freshman who reveals that she is very lonely\nand hoping to find a friend. After completing a form on which subjects\nindicated their impressions of Janet and their emotional responses to\nher note, they were presented with an unexpected opportunity to\nbefriend Janet by volunteering to take part in a study of long-term\nrelationships involving an initial meeting with Janet and periodic\nphone interviews about the development of their friendship.\nParticipants who were willing to help were asked how much time they\nwere willing to spend with Janet during the next month.\n\nTo manipulate empathy, Batson and his associates used the Stotland\ntechnique. Subjects assigned to the low-empathy condition were\ninstructed to \n\n\nRead the information in the communicator\u2019s notes carefully,\ntrying to be as objective as possible. Try to focus on the techniques\nused to get the communicator\u2019s message across. \n\n\nSubjects assigned to the high-empathy condition were instructed to\n\n\n\nRead the information in the communicator\u2019s notes carefully,\ntrying to take the perspective of the individual writing the notes.\nTry to imagine how this individual feels about what he or she writes.\n(1991: 132)\n\n\nFour steps were taken to manipulate the perceived potential for\nnegative social evaluation. In the low-potential condition\n(1991: 132):\n\nSubjects were told that they would be the only person ever to read\nthe communicator\u2019s notes, and the notes were delivered in a\nsealed envelope.\nSubjects were assured that the questionnaires reporting their\nreactions to Janet\u2019s note would be anonymous.\nSubjects\u2019 responses to the invitation to participate in the\nlong-term relationship study were returned to the professor in a\nsealed envelope, so no one would know if they did not want to help\nJanet. (Since they believed the professor had not read Janet\u2019s\nnote, they could be expected to surmise that he would not know that\nJanet needed a friend.)\nIn the letter inviting them to participate in the relationship\nstudy, subjects were told that Janet would be contacted \u201conly if\nyou want a meeting; if you do not, then we will not contact the\ncommunicator and he or she will not know that you were ever asked\nabout actually meeting\u201d.\n\n\nIn the high-potential condition (1991: 133):\n\nSubjects were told that the experimenter would read the\ncommunicator\u2019s notes. Also, the experimenter would collect the\nquestionnaire when the subject completed it and would compare the\ncontent of the notes with the impressions the subject formed.\nNo envelope was provided for their response to the invitation to\nparticipate in the long-term relationship study, so subjects could\ninfer that the experimenter would know about Janet\u2019s need for a\nfriend, about their emotional reaction to Janet, and would also know\nwhether or not they had agreed to help Janet.\nSubjects were told that Janet would know if they decided not to\nhelp.\n\n\nAs Batson notes, procedures in the high-potential condition \n\n\nwere designed to highlight the possibility of negative social\nevaluation if the participant decided not to volunteer to spend time\nwith Janet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Negative\nSocial Evaluation\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nHigh\n0.67\n1.71\n\nLow\n1.29\n2.44\n \n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 3. Amount of Help Offered Janet,\ngiven as the mean amount of time participants offered to spend with\nJanet (Fultz et al. 1986, Study 2)\n\n\nThe results, given in Table 3, indicate that the socially administered\nempathy-specific punishment hypothesis did not fare well. On the basis\nof this experiment and a similar experiment in which empathy for Janet\nwas not manipulated but was measured by self-report, Batson concludes\nthat the socially administered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\nis not consistent with the experimental facts.\n\n\nContrary to what the social-evaluation version of the empathy-specific\npunishment hypothesis predicted, eliminating anticipated negative\nsocial evaluation in these two studies did not eliminate the\nempathy-helping relationship. Rather than high empathy leading to more\nhelp only under high social evaluation, it led to more helping under\nboth low and high social evaluation. This pattern of results is not\nconsistent with what would be expected if empathically aroused\nindividuals are egoistically motivated to avoid looking bad in the\neyes of others; it is quite consistent with what would be expected if\nempathy evokes altruistic motivation to reduce the victim\u2019s need\n(Batson 1991: 134).\n\n\nThough two experiments hardly make a conclusive case, these studies\nmake the socially administered empathy-specific punishment hypothesis\nlook significantly less plausible than the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis. So one popular egoist hypothesis has been dealt a serious\nblow: high empathy subjects were more likely to help whether or\nnot they could expect their behavior to be socially\nscrutinized. At least in some circumstances, empathy appears to\nfacilitate helping independently of the threat of social sanction.\n5.2 The Aversive-Arousal Reduction Hypothesis\n\nAnother popular egoistic strategy for explaining the link between\nempathy and helping behavior is the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis, which maintains that witnessing someone in need, and\nthe empathy it evokes, is an unpleasant or aversive experience, and\nthat helping is motivated by the desire to diminish that aversive\n experience.[17]\n If this is right, Batson maintains, people in a high empathy\ncondition will sometimes have two quite different ways of reducing the\naversive experience\u2014they can help the person in need or they can\nsimply leave. Which strategy a person adopts will depend, in\npart, on how difficult or costly it is to depart the scene. If escape\nis easy, people will be more likely to take that option, while if\nleaving is more difficult people will be more likely to help, since\nthat is a less costly way of ending the aversive experience. If, on\nthe other hand, the empathy-altruism hypothesis is correct and empathy\nleads to genuinely altruistic motivation, one would expect people in a\nhigh empathy condition to help whether escape is easy or hard, since\nonly helping will satisfy an altruistic desire.\n\nAltruism and egoism both allow that even in the absence of empathy, an\nemotionally disturbing need situation will produce feelings of\npersonal distress, thus they would both predict that people\nin a low empathy condition will be more inclined to help when escape\nis difficult, and less inclined when escape is easy. Batson summarizes\nthese predictions in Tables 4 and 5 (Batson 1991: 111).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nEasy\nLow\nLow\n\nDifficult\nHigh\nHigh/Very High\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Predictions from the\nEmpathy-Altruism Hypothesis for the Rate of Helping in an Escape X\nEmpathy Design\n\n\nTo test these predictions, Batson and his associates conducted a total\nof six experiments. In one of these (experiment 1 in Batson, Duncan,\net al. 1981), student subjects were required to watch, via what they\nbelieved to be closed circuit TV transmission\u2014actually a\nscripted video recording\u2014as another student subject,\nElaine\u2014actually a confederate\u2014attempted to perform a task\nwhile receiving electric shocks at random intervals. Observer subjects\nwere told that their task would be to form and report an impression of\nhow Elaine performs under aversive conditions. On the tape, Elaine is\nclearly finding the shocks very uncomfortable, and after her second\ntrial at doing the task, she explains to Martha, the assistant\nadministering the shocks, that she is unusually sensitive to mild\nelectric shocks because of a childhood trauma. Martha then suggests\nthat perhaps the observer subject might be willing to help Elaine by\ntaking her place, and the experimenter asks whether the subject is\nwilling to do that. To manipulate ease of escape, some subjects were\ntold that if they decide not to take Elaine\u2019s place, they will\nbe required to watch eight additional trials, while other subjects\nwere told that if they decide not to take Elaine\u2019s place they\nare free to go. To manipulate the level of empathy that subjects feel\nfor Elaine, subjects were given a copy of a personal values and\ninterests questionnaire, allegedly filled out by Elaine, in order to\nhelp them form an impression of her performance. In the high empathy\ncondition, Elaine\u2019s values and interests were very similar to\nthe subject\u2019s (which had been determined in a screening session\nseveral weeks before), while in the low empathy condition, they were\nvery different.\n\nThe results, given in Table 6, clearly exhibit the pattern predicted\nby the empathy-altruism hypothesis, not the pattern predicted by the\naversive-arousal reduction hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape\nEmpathy\n\nLow\nHigh \n\nEasy\n0.18\n0.91\n\nDifficult\n0.64\n0.82\n\n \n\n\u2190\nLevel of Empathy\n\n\u2190\nLevel of Helping\n\n\n\nTable 6. Proportion of Subjects Agreeing\nto Take Shocks for Elaine (Batson, Duncan, et al. 1981,\nExperiment\u00a01)\n\n\nIn additional experiments, Batson and his associates used four\ndifferent techniques to create the low- and high-empathy conditions,\ntwo techniques for manipulating ease of escape, and two different need\nsituations (Batson, Duncan, et al. 1981; Toi and Batson 1982; Batson,\nO\u2019Quin et al. 1983). The results in all of these experiments\nexhibited the same pattern. Intriguingly, in another experiment,\nBatson and colleagues attempted to break the pattern by telling the\nsubjects that the shock level they would have to endure was the\nhighest of four options, \u201cclearly painful but not\nharmful\u201d. They reasoned that, under these circumstances, even if\nhigh empathy subjects had an ultimate desire to help, this desire\nmight well be overridden by the desire to avoid a series of very\npainful shocks. As expected, the pattern of results in this experiment\nfit the pattern in\n Table 4.\n\nThese are impressive findings. Over and over again, in well designed\nand carefully conducted experiments, Batson and his associates have\nproduced results which are clearly compatible with the predictions of\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis, as set out in\n Table 5,\n and clearly incompatible with the predictions of the aversive-arousal\nreduction hypothesis, as set out in\n Table 4.\n Even the \u201cclearly painful shock\u201d experiment, which\nproduced results in the pattern of Table 4, are comfortably compatible\nwith the empathy-altruism hypothesis; as noted earlier, the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis allows that high empathy subjects may have\ndesires that are stronger than their ultimate desire to help the\ntarget, and the desire to avoid a painful electric shock is a very\nplausible candidate.\n\nThere is, however, a problem to be overcome before one concludes that\nthe aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis cannot explain the findings\nthat Batson and his associates have reported. In arguing that\n Table 4\n reflects the predictions made by the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis, Batson must assume that escape will alleviate the aversive\naffect in both low & high empathy situations, and that subjects\nbelieve this (although the belief may not be readily\navailable to introspection). One might call this the out of\nsight, out of mind assumption. Elaborating on an idea suggested\nby Hoffman (1991) and Hornstein (1991), an advocate of egoism might\npropose that although subjects do believe this when they have little\nempathy for the target, they do not believe it when they have high\nempathy for the target. Perhaps high empathy subjects believe\nthat if they escape they will continue to be troubled by the thought\nor memory of the distressed target and thus that physical escape will\nnot lead to psychological escape. Indeed, in cases where empathy is\nstrong and is evoked by attachment, this is just what common sense\nwould lead us to expect. Do you really believe that if your mother was\nin grave distress and you left without helping her you would not\ncontinue to be troubled by the knowledge that she was still in\ndistress? We\u2019re guessing that you don\u2019t. But if the\nhigh-empathy subjects in Batson\u2019s experiments believe that they\nwill continue to be plagued by distressing thoughts about the target\neven after they depart, then the egoistic aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis predicts that these subjects will be inclined to help in\nboth the easy physical escape and the difficult physical escape\nconditions, since helping is the only strategy they believe will be\neffective for reducing the aversive arousal. So neither the results\nreported in\n Table 6\n nor the results of any of Batson\u2019s other experiments would give\nus a reason to prefer the empathy-altruism hypothesis over the\naversive-arousal reduction hypothesis, because both hypotheses make\nthe same prediction.\n\nIs it the case that high empathy subjects in experiments like\nBatson\u2019s believe that unless they help they will continue to\nthink about the target and thus continue to feel distress, and that\nthis belief leads to helping because it generates an egoistic\ninstrumental desire to help? This is, of course, an empirical\nquestion, and a cleverly designed experiment by Stocks and his\nassociates (Stocks et al. 2009) suggests that, in situations like\nthose used in Batson\u2019s experiments, a belief that they will\ncontinue to think about the target does not play a\nsignificant role in causing the helping behavior in high empathy\nsubjects.\n\nBatson\u2019s work on the aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis,\nbuttressed by the Stocks et al. finding, is a major advance in the\negoism vs. altruism debate. The aversive-arousal reduction hypothesis\nhas been one of the most popular egoistic strategies for explaining\nhelping behavior. But the experimental findings strongly suggest that\nin situations like those that Batson and his associates have studied,\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis offers a much better explanation of\nthe subjects\u2019 behavior than the aversive-arousal reduction\nhypothesis.\n\nAs noted earlier, Batson and his colleagues have also designed\nexperiments pitting the empathy-altruism hypothesis against a\nsubstantial list of other egoistic explanations for the link between\nempathy and helping behavior. In each case, the evidence appears to\nchallenge the egoistic alternative, though as is almost always the\ncase in empirical work of this sort, some researchers remain\n unconvinced.[18]\n There is however, an influential critique of Batson\u2019s work that\nchallenges all of his experimental work on the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis. It argues that empathy and its precursors\nalter people\u2019s self-concept in a way that undermines the claim\nthat their helping behavior is genuinely altruistic.\n5.3 The Challenge Posed by \u201cSelf-Other Merging\u201d\n\nDuring the last three decades, psychologists have devoted a great deal\nof effort to exploring how people think of the self. One major theme\nin this literature is that people\u2019s conception of themselves\nvaries across cultures, and that in many non-western cultures\none\u2019s social roles and one\u2019s relation to other people play\na much more central role in people\u2019s self-concepts than they do\nin the individualistic West (Markus & Kitayama 1991; Baumeister\n1998). One very simple way of studying these differences is to ask\npeople to respond to the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d fifteen\ntimes. Non-westerners will typically mention social groups, group\nroles and relationships: \u201cI am Maasai\u201d, \u201cI am a\nperson who brings fruit to the temple\u201d, \u201cI am my\nfather\u2019s youngest son\u201d. Westerners, by contrast, will\ntypically mention personal attributes, aspirations and achievements:\n\u201cI am intelligent\u201d, \u201cI am a pre-med student\u201d,\n\u201cI am the fastest swimmer in my school\u201d (Ma &\nSchoeneman 1997). Another theme is that people\u2019s conception of\nthemselves is situationally malleable\u2014it changes depending on\nwho we are with, where we are and what we are doing (Kihlstrom &\nCantor 1984; Markus & Wurf 1987). \n\nWhile this sort of situational malleability may not be surprising, a\nnumber of psychologists have suggested a much more radical situational\nmalleability. Under certain circumstances, notably when we have a\nclose personal relationship with another person, when we are trying to\ntake the perspective of another person, or when we feel empathy for\nanother person, the conceptual boundary between the self and the other\nperson disappears; the self and the other merge. According to Arthur\nAron and colleagues,\n\n\nMuch of our cognition about the other in a close relationship is\ncognition in which the other is treated as self or confused with\nself\u2014the underlying reason being a self-other merging. (Aron et\nal. 1980: 242)\n\n\nIf this is true, then it poses a fundamental challenge to the claim\nthat helping behavior directed at someone for whom we feel empathy is\nreally altruistic. For, as Melvin Lerner memorably observed:\n\n\nIt seems that we respond sympathetically, with compassion and a sense\nof concern, when we feel a sense of identity with the victim. In\neffect, we are reacting to the thought of ourselves in that situation.\nAnd, of course, we are filled with the \u201cmilk of human\nkindness\u201d for our own sweet, innocent selves. (Lerner 1980:\n77)\n\n\nA bit less colorfully, Batson notes that for \u201cthe contrast\nbetween altruism and egoism to be meaningful\u201d, an individual\nproviding help \u201cmust perceive self and other to be distinct\nindividuals\u201d (2011: 145\u2013146). And \n\n\nif the distinction between self and other vanishes then so does the\ndistinction between altruism and egoism, at least as these terms are\nused in the empathy-altruism hypothesis. (2011: 148)\n\n\nPsychologists who have debated the rather astonishing claim that\npeople who provide help to others often lose track of the distinction\nbetween themselves and the person being helped have proposed several\ndifferent ways of determining whether this sort of \u201cself-other\nmerging\u201d has occurred. Before considering these, however, we\nshould remind ourselves of an important philosophical distinction that\nwill be crucial in assessing tests for self-other\n merging.[19]\n The distinction is often made using the labels \u201cqualitative\nidentity\u201d and \u201cnumerical identity\u201d. Qualitative\nidentity is the relation that often obtains between two TV sets\nmanufactured by the same company. They share most of their important\nproperties. Numerical identity is a relationship that obtains between\na person at one time in his life and that same person at another time\nin his life. If the time gap is substantial, the person at the earlier\ntime may differ in many ways from the person at the later time. When\nyou were a baby, you weighed less than 10 kg, spoke no language, and\ncouldn\u2019t walk. But you now are numerically the same person as\nthe baby. Numerical identity can be of enormous legal and moral\nimportance, a point nicely illustrated by the trial of John Demjanuk,\nthe Ukrainian-born auto worker who was accused of being the sadistic\nNazi concentration camp guard whose victims called him \u201cIvan the\nTerrible\u201d. The man on trial, in 1988, differed in many ways from\nthe concentration camp guard: he was much older, heavier, bald, and\nspoke English. He was obviously not even close to being qualitatively\nidentical with perpetrator of Ivan\u2019s crimes. What the court had\nto determine was not whether Ivan and Demjanuk were qualitatively\nidentical but whether they were numerically\n identical.[20]\n What makes this distinction important for present purposes is that\nthe sort of identity that is relevant to the debate between egoists\nand altruists is numerical identity, not qualitative identity. If\nSophia, at age 30, sets aside a large sum of money that will be paid\nto Sophia at age 70, young Sophia is not being altruistic. If her\nultimate goal is to ensure that old Sophia has the means to live a\ncomfortable life, then young Sophia\u2019s action is\nstraightforwardly egoistic. The take-home message here is that if a\ntest used to determine whether person A takes herself to be\nidentical to person B is to be relevant to the egoism versus\naltruism debate, the test must provide evidence that person A\ntakes herself to be numerically identical to person B,\nnot that she takes herself to be qualitatively identical to\nperson B.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider how psychologists have attempted to assess\nwhether experimental participants feel a sense of identity with\nsomeone they might be called on to help. In one of the most\ninfluential studies claiming to show that helping is often the product\nof a feeling of oneness, Cialdini et al. (1997) used a pair of\ntests.\n\n\n[P]articipants rated the extent of oneness they felt with the [person\nthey might help] by responding to two items that were combined in all\nanalyses to form a oneness index. The first item incorporated the\nInclusion of Other in Self (IOS) Scale used by Aron et al. (1992) to measure self-other\nboundary overlap. It consisted of a set of seven pairs of increasingly\noverlapping circles. Participants selected the pair of circles that\nthey believed best characterized their relationship with the [person\nthey might help]. The second item asked participants to indicate on a\n7-point scale the extent to which they would use the term we\nto describe their relationship with the [person they might help].\n(1997: 484)\n\n\nIn a critique of the Cialdini et al. paper, Batson, Sager, et al.\n(1997) used three measures of self-other merging. One was the IOS\nScale used by Cialdini et al. The second was a \u201cperceived\nsimilarity\u201d task in which \u201c[p]articipants were asked,\n\u2018How similar to you do you think the person \u2026is?\u2019\n(1 = somewhat, 9 = extremely)\u201d (1997: 500). In the third,\nparticipants rated both themselves and the target on a series of\npersonal attributes. The \u201cmeasure of merging was the mean\nabsolute difference between ratings of self and other\u201d (1997:\n498).\n\nIt does not seem that any of these four tests of self-other merging\nprovide a reason to believe that the participant views herself as\nnumerically identical with another person. Indeed, both the perceived\nsimilarity test and the personal attribute rating test seem to be\nassessing qualitative identity rather than numerical identity.  And it\nis far from clear what, if anything, the other two tests are\nmeasuring. So it seems that there is really no evidence at all that\npeople in close relationships lose track of the distinction between\nthemselves and another person. Indeed, as May notes, if someone really\ndid believe that he exists in two obviously distinct bodies, the most\nnatural conclusion to draw would be that he is delusional (May 2011b:\n32).\n\nWhile the literature on self-other merging provides little reason to\nbelieve that normal people take themselves to be numerically identical\nwith another person, it does provide a different kind of challenge to\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis defended by Batson and his colleagues.\nThat hypothesis, it will be recalled, is that empathy often causes an\nultimate desire to help another person. But in the Cialdini et al.\n(1977) paper cited earlier, they report three studies indicating that\nempathy, though it does occur, is not playing any causal role in the\nprocess that leads to helping. Rather, they maintain, it is\n\u201cmerging\u201d\u2014which is used here as a label for whatever\nthe IOS scale and the use-of-we test measure\u2014that is\nactually leading participants to help. Though the Cialdini et al.\npaper is quite sophisticated, Batson et al. (1997) pointed out a number of\nmethodological problems. When they conducted a pair of experiments\nthat avoided these methodological problems, the role of empathy in\nproducing helping behavior was clearly evident. However, most\nexperiments exploring the link between empathy and helping behavior,\nincluding this one, use a relatively small number of participants. And\nthe \u201creplication crisis\u201d that has emerged in recent years\nhas led many to worry about the robustness of the effects reported in\nexperiments like these (Chambers 2017). McAuliffe et al. (2018) have\naddressed these concerns. Their high powered, pre-registered study,\nrun on the internet, analyzed data from 680 participants. Their\nfindings were \u201cunambiguously supportive\u201d (2018: 504) of\nthe link between empathy and helping behavior.\n5.4 Have Batson\u2019s Studies Made a Convincing Case for the Existence of Altruism in Humans?\n\nBatson\u2019s answer to this question is clear.\n\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence from research designed to test the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis against the six egoistic alternatives\n\u2026, it is time to come to a conclusion\u2014albeit\ntentative\u2014about the status of this hypothesis. The idea that\nempathy produces altruistic motivation may seem improbable given the\ndominance of Western thought by the doctrine of universal egoism. Yet,\nin the words of Sherlock Holmes, \u201cWhen you have eliminated the\nimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the\ntruth\u201d. It seems impossible for any known egoistic explanation\nof the empathy-helping relationship\u2014or any combination of\nthem\u2014to account for the research evidence we have reviewed. So\nwhat remains? The empathy-altruism hypothesis. Pending new evidence or\na plausible new egoistic explanation of the existing evidence, we seem\nforced to accept this improbable hypothesis as true. (Batson 2011:\n 160)[21]\n\n\n\nBatson\u2019s research program is compelling, and he certainly has\nshown that the empathy-altruism hypothesis is \u201cin the\nhunt\u201d, but his findings are not conclusive.  There are a number\nof reasonable challenges to the methodology and the conclusions in some\nof Batson\u2019s studies.  Setting these out in detail is a\nsubstantial project (see Stich, Doris, & Roedder 2010). But there\nis also a plausible egoistic hypothesis that has not been\nsystematically explored. \n\nIn recent years, a number of authors have made an impressive case for\nthe hypothesis that belief in a \u201cBig God\u201d\u2014a\nsupernatural being who is omniscient, morally concerned, and acts as a\npolicing agent in human affairs\u2014played a crucial role in the\ntransition from face-to-face \u201cband level\u201d human groups\nmade up of at most a few hundred individuals to much larger tribal\ngroups, and ultimately to chiefdoms and nation states (Norenzayan et\nal. 2016). These are provocative and controversial ideas. Much less\ncontroversial is the claim that many people believe that even when no\nother human can observe them, a supernatural being of some sort is\naware of what they are doing and thinking, and that this being may\npunish thoughts and behavior it disapproves of and reward thoughts and\nbehavior it approves of, with the punishments and rewards delivered\neither during the agent\u2019s lifetime or after she\n dies.[22]\n In the experiments, described in\n section 5.1,\n designed to test the empathy-altruism hypothesis against the social\npunishment hypothesis, Batson and his colleagues went to great lengths\nto insure that participants in the \u201clow potential for negative\nsocial evaluation\u201d condition would think that no one knew of\ntheir decisions, and thus that no one would think badly of them or\nsanction them if they decided not to help. But, of course, none of the\nsteps taken to insure secrecy would be effective in keeping an\nomniscient God from knowing what these participants had decided. So if\nwe assume that many people believe an omniscient God wants them to\nhelp others in need, and that they believe Divine sanctions for not\nhelping are more likely when the target engenders\n empathy,[23]\n the experiments do nothing to rule out a variation of the social\npunishment hypothesis which maintains that participants are motivated\nby a desire to avoid punishments administered by God.\n\nThe egoistic alternative just sketched, which might be called\n\u201cthe divine punishment hypothesis\u201d, also leads to\nthe pattern of predictions derived from the empathy-altruism\n hypothesis sketched in\n Table 5,\n and the results reported in\n Table 6.\nThe bottom line is that using the Sherlock Holmes standard that Batson\nfavors, there is still a lot of work to do. There is a family of\negoistic hypotheses invoking beliefs in supernatural\npunishments\u2014or supernatural rewards\u2014that still needs to be\nruled out before we accept the \u201cimprobable hypothesis\u201d as\ntrue.[24]\n\n6. Beyond Egoism vs. Altruism\n\nIn the colorful passage quoted at the beginning of\n section 5.4,\n Batson seems to suggest that in the debate between egoists and\naltruists there are only two possible outcomes. If all human behavior\nis ultimately motivated by self-interested desires, then the egoist\nwins; if some human behavior is motivated by ultimate desires for the\nwell-being of other people, then the altruist wins. However, as \nnoted in\n section 2,\n the dialectical landscape is more complex, for there are many desires\nthat are neither self-interested nor desires for the well-being of\nother people. If any of these are ultimate desires that lead to\nbehavior, then the egoist is mistaken. But, as Batson clearly\nrecognizes, this would not vindicate altruism; both egoism and\naltruism might be mistaken. \n\nBatson has used the term principlism for one family of\nultimate desires that would support neither egoism nor altruism.\n\n\nPrinciplism is motivation with the ultimate goal of upholding some\nmoral principle\u2014for example, a principle of fairness or justice,\nor the utilitarian principle of greatest good for the greatest number.\n(Batson 2011: 220)\n\n\nUnder some circumstances, one or another of these principles might\nrequire helping behavior, though that helping behavior would not be\naltruistic, since the ultimate desire motivating the behavior is to\nuphold the principle. On Batson\u2019s view, we really don\u2019t\nknow much about principlism. \n\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there is no clear empirical evidence that\nupholding justice (or any other moral principle) functions as an\nultimate\n goal.[25]\n Nor is there clear empirical evidence that rules this possibility\nout. (Batson 2011: 224)\n\n\nBut if that\u2019s right, then Batson\u2019s conclusion that the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis is true and that people are sometimes\naltruistic is premature. For even if it were conceded that all the\nplausible egoistic alternatives to empathy-altruism have been\nexcluded, the job of testing empathy-altruism against principalist\nalternatives has hardly begun. Moreover, the scope of that project may\nbe much larger than Batson imagines. \n\nOne way to see this is to ask which action guiding principles are\nmoral\n principles.[26]\n There is ongoing debate about this question in both philosophy and\npsychology (Stich 2018). Though Batson does not address that debate,\nthe examples he offers (\u201cfairness or justice or the utilitarian\nprinciple\u201d) suggest that when he talks about moral principles he\nhas a rather limited set of principles in mind. But if principlism is\nlimited to a relatively small set of moral principles familiar from\nthe philosophical literature, then principlism hardly exhausts the\nnon-egoistic alternatives that defenders of psychological altruism\nmust rule out. In recent years, there has been a growing body of work\non the role of norms in human life, where norms are\nunderstood as action guiding rules that can govern just about any\nhuman activity. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have argued\nthat norms, and a robust innate psychology for acquiring, storing and\nacting on norms, have played a fundamental role in shaping human\nculture and making humans the most successful large animal on the\nplanet (Henrich 2015; Boyd 2018; Kelly & Davis 2018). Others have\nproposed accounts of norm psychology on which people have ultimate\ndesires to comply with culturally acquired norms (Sripada & Stich\n2006) and accounts of how a psychological system generating such\nultimate desires might be favored by natural selection (Sripada 2008).\nThe sorts of behavioral rules that count as norms in this literature\nmight well include the sorts of moral principles that Batson had in\nmind when he characterized principlism. But these are only a small\nsubset of the norms that these researchers have in mind. What makes\nall of this relevant to our current topic is that any\nculturally acquired norm might generate an ultimate desire to comply,\nand most of those ultimate desires are neither egoistic nor\naltruistic. Thus to make a plausible case that an episode of helping\nbehavior is altruistic, it is not enough to rule out egoistic\nexplanations and explanations that appeal to principlism. The defender\nof psychological altruism must also rule out explanations that trace\nthe helping behavior to an ultimate desire to comply with any of the\nvast collection of norms that prevail in human cultures. And\nthat\u2019s a job that defenders of altruism have not even begun.\n\n\nAnother possibility is that some helping behavior might not be\nmotivated by ultimate desires at all. G\u0119siarz and Crockett (2015)\nargue that, in addition to the goal-directed system, behavior,\nincluding helping behavior, is sometimes produced by what they call\nthe habitual and Pavlovian systems. The habitual\nsystem leads to actions that have the highest expected value based on\nprevious life experiences rather than possible consequences indicated\nby features of the current situation. As a result, helping behavior\nmay be repeated in the future and in circumstances in which motivating\nfactors like the promise of rewards are absent if the behavior has\nbeen rewarded in the past. Like the habitual system, the Pavlovian\nsystem produces behavior with the highest expected value based on the\npast. Unlike the habitual system, however, the Pavlovian system\nproduces behavior that has been successful in the evolutionary past,\nrather than in an individual\u2019s past. This means that behavioral\ndispositions that have led to reproductive success in a\nindividual\u2019s evolutionary past may have become innate or\n\u201chard-wired\u201d through natural selection. If it is indeed\nthe case that some helping behavior is produced by the habitual or\nPavlovian systems, then egoism is false. And if some helping behavior\nis egoistically motivated and the rest is produced by the habitual and\nPavlovian systems, then altruism is also false. \n7. The Bottom Line\n\nBatson and his collaborators have accomplished a great deal. They have\nformulated a sophisticated altruist hypothesis, the empathy-altruism\nhypothesis, that can be tested against competing egoist hypotheses,\nand they have designed experiments making a strong case that many of\nthose egoist hypotheses are false. But to show that altruism is true,\nit is not enough to show that specific egoist hypotheses can\u2019t\nexplain specific episodes of helping behavior. Nor would it be enough\nto show that all plausible versions of egoism are false. It must also\nbe shown that episodes of helping behavior that can\u2019t be\nexplained egoistically can\u2019t be explained by another process,\nsuch as principalistic ultimate motivation or ultimate motivation by a\nnon-moral norm. In addition, the defender of altruism must show that\nnon-egoistic episodes of helping behavior are not the product of the\nhabitual or Pavlovian systems. None of Batson\u2019s experiments were\ndesigned to rule out these non-egoistic options or others that might\nbe suggested. So there is still much work to be done. \n\nOn a more positive note, it seems that Batson and his associates have\nshown quite conclusively that the methods of experimental psychology\ncan move the debate forward. Indeed, one might argue that Batson has\nmade more progress in this area during the last four decades than\nphilosophers using the traditional philosophical methodology of a\npriori arguments buttressed by anecdote and intuition have made in the\nprevious two millennia. Their work powerfully demonstrates the utility\nof empirical methods in moral psychology; philosophical moral\npsychologists debating the altruism-egoism question have always made\nempirical claim, and it is now evident that the human sciences possess\nresources to help us empirically assess those empirical claims.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aquinas, Thomas, 1270 [1917], <em>The Summa Theologica</em>, Vol\n2, Part II, New York: Benziger Brothers.", "Aron, Arthur, Elaine N.
