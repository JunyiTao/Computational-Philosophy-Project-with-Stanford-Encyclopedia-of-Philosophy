    "main_text": "\n\nInfinity is a big topic. Most people have some conception of\nthings that have no bound, no boundary, no limit, no end. The rigorous\nstudy of infinity began in mathematics and philosophy, but the\nengagement with infinity traverses the history of cosmology,\nastronomy, physics, and theology. In the natural and social sciences,\nthe infinite sometimes appears as a consequence of our theories\nthemselves (Barrow 2006, Luminet and Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey 2005) or in\nthe modelling of the relevant phenomena (Fletcher et al. 2019).\nMathematics itself has appealed to some form of infinity from its\nbeginning (infinitely many numbers, shapes, iterated addition or\ndivision of segments) and its contemporary practice requires\ninfinitary foundations. Any field that employs mathematics at least\nflirts with infinity indirectly, and in many cases courts it\ndirectly.\n\nPhilosophy countenances infinity in myriad ways, either directly or\nindirectly, in most of its sub-fields\u2014here is a tiny sample\ntaken from the contemporary discussion (we shall discuss historical\nmaterial in Section\n 1\n and in Section\n 2,\n and many further examples in later sections). Some metaphysicians\ncontend that there are infinitely many possibilities/possible worlds\nand canvas how big this infinity is (e.g. Lewis 1986). Philosophers of\nreligion debate whether the divine is infinite, whether the divine\ncreation is infinite, and whether the value of the afterlife is\ninfinite. Epistemologists debate whether there can be an infinite\nregress of justification, and if so, whether it is problematic (Klein\n2000, Peijnenburg 2007, Atkinson and Peijnenburg 2017). Formal\nepistemologists traffic largely in an infinitary notion of\n\u2018probability\u2019 (more in Section\n 6).\n Population ethics for infinite populations is a lively topic, and\nthey are thought to pose distinctive problems for consequentialism\n(Nelson 1991). Social and political philosophy appeal to the notion of\nconvention, often thought to involve \u2018common knowledge\u2019,\nwith a putative infinite hierarchy of mutual knowledge (Lewis 1969).\nPhilosophers of language and mind grapple with problems that\ninfinitary operations such as \u2018plus\u2019 create for meaning\nand rule-following (Kripke 1982), and whether language itself, or\nminds themselves, can be infinite (Nefdt 2019). Philosophers of\nmathematics debate whether stipulations that imply the existence of\ninfinitely many objects can be said to be analytic (Boolos 1997,\nWright 1999) and whether criteria of identity for infinite numbers\nmust necessarily be Cantorian (Mancosu 2016). See Section\n 4.\n Concerns about infinity (and human finitude) appear in continental\nphilosophy, not only in its 19th century historical sources (e.g.,\namong others, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche)\nbut in contemporary developments as well (e.g., among others,\nHeidegger 1929, Levinas 1961, Adorno 1966, Foucault 1966, Deleuze\n1969, Badiou 2019). This list can be continued, if not ad\ninfinitum, then ad nauseam.\n\nAt this point, one may be tempted to shout three cheers\u2014or\nperhaps infinitely many of them\u2014for infinity. Indeed, one may\nget the impression that we can\u2019t live without it. At\nthe same time, there are various apparent problems with infinity, and\nit starts to look less congenial. As they pile up, one might get the\nimpression that we can\u2019t live with it. Infinity, as we\nshall see, gives rise to numerous paradoxes that have preoccupied\nphilosophers for millennia. Any praise of infinity must be tempered\nwith circumspection and caution.\n\nSo we have good reason to want to understand infinity better.\nMathematicians and philosophers in particular have done much to\nenhance our understanding of it. This entry strives to give the reader\na sense of some of the main lines of thought regarding infinity.\n\nOur survey begins in section\n 1,\n which unpacks some meanings of \u2018infinite\u2019, and traces\nvarious philosophical conceptions of infinity from ancient times to\nthe 19th Century. Section\n 2\n turns to the historical development of the mathematics of infinity\nover a comparable period. This provides background to a presentation\nin section\n 3\n of modern mathematics\u2019 treatment of infinity\u2014some\ninfinite number systems, infinities of measure, of counting, of\ncalculus, and infinitary operations on numbers. This in turn sets the\nstage for our discussion of mathematical ontology in section\n 4.\n\nUp to this point, it appears that infinity has been domesticated. This\nappearance begins to be challenged in section\n 5,\n when we canvas some classic paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity.\nIt reappears as both friend and foe in the following sections on some\nphilosophically fecund applications of it. In sections\n 6\n and\n 7,\n it is both central to the formulation of probability and decision\ntheory, and the source of more conundrums; we discuss some putative\nsolutions to them. Section\n 8\n presents some problems concerning space and time, as well as some\nprogress that has been made on them\u2014Kant\u2019s antinomies, a\nZeno-style paradox concerning measure, developments in non-Euclidean\ngeometries and relativistic cosmology, and in determining whether\nspace is finite or infinite. We conclude in section\n 9,\n sanguine overall about our relationship with infinity.\n\nGiven the magnitude of our topic, we clearly cannot cover all aspects\nof it, or even a sizable proportion of them. For example, we do not\nengage much with the many roles infinitude plays in science and the\nsocial sciences (except in section\n 8),\n retaining our focus on its roles in philosophy. We limit our\ndiscussion to what can be understood without highly advanced\nmathematics, but provide links to a number of supplementary documents\nthat discuss further issues: infinite idealizations, quadratures of\nthe circle, overviews of two recent developments in mathematics that\npromise to make the infinite realm more tractable (numerosity theories\nand surreal numbers), further paradoxes (God\u2019s lottery, two\nenvelopes), and proofs of theorems. We ask for the forbearance of\nreaders whose favorite topics have been left out. We hope to mitigate\nthis somewhat with our large set of pointers to further topics, the\nreferences in our extensive bibliography, and other internet\nresources.\n",
