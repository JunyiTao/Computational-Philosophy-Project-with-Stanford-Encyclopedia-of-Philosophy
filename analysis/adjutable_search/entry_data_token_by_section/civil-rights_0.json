    "main_text": "Free and Equal Citizenship\n1. Free and Equal Citizenship\n\nFree and equal citizens in a modern society enjoy rights to both\npublic and private autonomy. Each citizen must have rights securing\ntheir freedom to participate in the formation of public opinion and in\nsociety\u2019s collective decisions (public autonomy), as well as\nrights guaranteeing their freedom to decide what way of individual\nlife to pursue (private autonomy) (Habermas 1996). The importance of\nthese two dimensions of modern citizenship derives from what Rawls\ncalls \u201cthe two moral powers\u201d of personhood: the capacity\nto have and act from a sense of justice and the capacity to hold,\nrevise, and act from a conception of the good (1995: 164; 2001: 18).\nPersons stand as free and equal citizens when their society and its\npolitical system accord equal and due weight to the interest each one\nhas in the development and exercise of their own moral powers.\n\nThe idea of free and equal citizenship emerged over the course of\nseveral centuries in Western societies that would become modern\nrepresentative democracies. The idea can be traced back to 17th\ncentury English egalitarians and liberals, such as Lilburne (1649) and\nLocke (1690/1952), and it received dramatic expression during the\nFrench Revolution with its \u201cDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of\nthe Citizen\u201d (1789) and the overthrow of the entrenched hierarchies\nand absolutist rule of the ancien r\u00e9gime. But until well into\nthe 20th century, racist and sexist assumptions about which human\nbeings had the capacity to be fully contributing members of society\nled to an unduly constricted view of who could legitimately claim the\nrights of a free and equal citizen. Those assumptions have been\nlargely eliminated from philosophical discourse, although they persist\nin some segments of society.\n",
