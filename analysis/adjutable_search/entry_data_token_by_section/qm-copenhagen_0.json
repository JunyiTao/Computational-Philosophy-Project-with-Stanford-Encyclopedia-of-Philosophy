    "main_text": "The Background\n1. The Background\n\nIn 1900 Max Planck discovered that the radiation spectrum of black\nbodies occurs only with discrete energies separated by the value\nh\u03bd, where \u03bd is the frequency and h is\na new constant, the so-called Planck constant. According to classical\nphysics, the intensity of this continuous radiation would grow\nunlimitedly with growing frequencies, resulting in what was called the\nultraviolet catastrophe. But Planck\u2019s suggestion was that if\nblack bodies only exchange energy with the radiation field in a\nproportion equal to h\u03bd that problem would disappear. The\nfact that the absorption and the emission of energy is discontinuous\nis in conflict with the principles of classical physics. A few years\nlater Albert Einstein used this discovery in his explanation of the\nphotoelectric effect. He suggested that light waves were quantized,\nand that the amount of energy which each quantum of light could\ndeliver to the electrons of the cathode, was exactly h\u03bd.\nThe next step came in 1911 when Ernest Rutherford performed some\nexperiments shooting alpha particles into a gold foil. Based on these\nresults he could set up a model of the atom in which the atom\nconsisted of a heavy nucleus with a positive charge surrounded by\nnegatively charged electrons like a small solar system. Also this\nmodel was in conflict with the laws of classical physics. According to\nclassical mechanics and electrodynamics, one might expect that the\nelectrons orbiting around a positively charged nucleus would\ncontinuously emit radiation so that the nucleus would quickly swallow\nthe electrons.\n\nAt this point Niels Bohr entered the scene and soon became the leading\nphysicist on atoms. In 1913 Bohr, visiting Rutherford in Manchester,\nput forward a mathematical model of the atom which provided the first\ntheoretical support for Rutherford\u2019s model and could explain the\nemission spectrum of the hydrogen atom (the Balmer series). The theory\nwas based on two postulates:\n\nAn atomic system is only stable in a certain set of states, called\nstationary states, each state being associated with a discrete energy,\nand every change of energy corresponds to a complete transition from\none state to another.\nThe possibility for the atom to absorb and emit radiation is\ndetermined by a law according to which the energy of the radiation is\ngiven by the energy difference between two stationary states being\nequal to h\u03bd.\n\n\nSome features of Bohr\u2019s semi-classical model were indeed very\nstrange compared to the principles of classical physics. It introduced\nan element of discontinuity and indeterminism foreign to classical\nmechanics:\n\n Apparently not every point in space was accessible to an electron\nmoving around a hydrogen nucleus. An electron moved in classical\norbits, but during its transition from one orbit to another it was at\nno definite place between these orbits. Thus, an electron could only\nbe in its ground state (the orbit of lowest energy) or an excited\nstate (if an impact of another particle had forced it to leave its\nground state.)\n It was impossible to predict when the transition would take place\nand how it would take place. Moreover, there were no external (or\ninternal) causes that determined the \u201cjump\u201d back again.\nAny excited electron might in principle move spontaneously to either a\nlower state or down to the ground state.\nRutherford pointed out that if, as Bohr did, one postulates that\nthe frequency of light \u03bd, which an electron emits in a\ntransition, depends on the difference between the initial energy level\nand the final energy level, it appears as if the electron must\n\u201cknow\u201d to what final energy level it is heading in order\nto emit light with the right frequency. \nEinstein made another strange observation. He was curious to know\nin which direction the photon decided to move off from the\nelectron.\n\n\nBetween 1913 and 1925 Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld and others were able to\nimprove Bohr\u2019s model, and together with the introduction of spin\nand Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle it gave a reasonably\ngood description of the basic chemical elements. The model ran into\nproblems, nonetheless, when one tried to apply it to spectra other\nthan that of hydrogen. So there was a general feeling among all\nleading physicists that Bohr\u2019s model had to be replaced by a\nmore radical theory. In 1925 Werner Heisenberg, at that time\nBohr\u2019s assistant in Copenhagen, laid down the basic principles\nof a complete quantum mechanics. In his new matrix theory he replaced\nclassical commuting variables with non-commuting ones. The following\nyear, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger gave a simpler formulation of the theory\nin which he introduced a second-order differential equation for a wave\nfunction. He himself attempted a largely classical interpretation of\nthe wave function. However, already the same year Max Born proposed a\nconsistent statistical interpretation in which the square of the\nabsolute value of this wave function expresses a probability amplitude\nfor the outcome of a measurement.\n",
