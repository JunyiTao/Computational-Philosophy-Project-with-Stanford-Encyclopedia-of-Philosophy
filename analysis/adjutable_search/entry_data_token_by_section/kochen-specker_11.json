    "main_text": "Escaping the KS Argument || Contextuality\n5.3 Contextuality\n\n\nFinally, we might accept VD and VR, but deny that our construction of\nan observable f(Q) is unambiguous. Thus, though\nf(Q) and g(P) are\nmathematically identical, we could assume that they correspond to\ndifferent observables, arguing that an actual determination of\nv(f(Q)) must proceed via measuring\nQ, but the determination of\nv(g(P)) involves measuring P which\nis incompatible with Q. Since\nv(f(Q)) and\nv(g(P)) are thus outcomes of different\nmeasurement situations, there is no reason to assume that\nv(f(Q)) =\nv(g(P)). This way to block the KS proof\ncomes to understanding f(Q) and\ng(P) as different observables (because of\nsensitivity to context), thus it amounts to rejecting NC. There are\nmainly two ways, in the literature, to further motivate this step.\nAccordingly, there are two important brands of contextuality to be\ndiscussed \u2014 causal and ontological contextuality.\n\n\nThe KS argument has been presented for possessed values of a QM system\n\u2014 independently of considerations about measurement. Indeed, in\nthe argument measurement was mentioned only once and in the negative\n\u2014 in NC. However, since now we consider the rejection of NC, we\nmust also take into account measurement and its complications. For\nthat purpose it is good to explicate yet another principle that\nmanifests our innocuous realism (see the introduction above), i.e. a\nprinciple of faithful measurement:\n\nFaithful Measurement (FM): QM measurement of an\nobservable faithfully delivers the value which that observable had\nimmediately prior to the measurement interaction.\n\nFM is also an extremely plausible presupposition of natural science,\nin general. (Note that FM entails VD, hence we could have given a KS\nargument for possible measurement results, using FM). Consider now the\nmotivation, for the HV proponent, to reject NC. Obviously, the aim is\nto save other presuppositions, especially VD. Now, VD and NC are\nindependent realist convictions, but NC and FM are not quite so\nindependent. Indeed, we will see that rejection of NC entails the\nrejection of FM in one version of contextuality, and strongly suggests\nit in the other. (This makes more precise the somewhat cryptic remark\nfrom the introduction that it is not obvious what an interpretation\nendorsing the realist principle VD, but rejecting the realist\nprinciple NC, should look like. Such an interpretation would have to\nviolate a third realist principle, i.e. FM.)\nCausal Contextuality\n\n\nA property (value of an observable) might be causally context-dependent in the\nsense that it is causally sensitive to how it is measured. The basic\nidea is that the observed value comes about as the effect of the\nsystem-apparatus interaction. Hence, measuring a system via\ninteraction with a P-measuring apparatus might yield a value\nv(g(P)), measuring the same system via\ninteraction with a Q-measuring apparatus a different value\nv(f(Q)), although both observables are\nrepresented by the same operator f(Q) =\ng(P). The difference in values is explained in\nterms of a context-dependence of the observables: The latter are\ncontext-dependent, since the different ways to physically realize them\ncausally influence the system in different ways and thereby change the\nobserved values.\n\n\nIf an interpreter wanted to defend causal contextuality, this would\nentail abandoning FM, at least for observables of the type\nf(Q) (non-maximal observables): Since their values\ncausally depend on the presence of certain measurement arrangements,\nthese arrangements are causally necessary for the values to come\nabout, thus the values cannot be present before the system-apparatus\ninteraction, and FM is violated.  As an advantage of causal\ncontextualism the following might be pointed out. It does not imply\nthat the ontological status of the physical properties involved must\nchange, i.e. does not imply that they become relational. If the\nproperty in an object is brought about via interaction with another\none, it can still be one which the object has for itself after the\ninteraction. However, the idea of causal contextuality is sometimes\ndiscussed critically, since there is reason to think that it may be\nempirically inadequate (see Shimony 1984, Stairs 1992).\nOntological Contextuality\n\n\nA property (value of an observable) might be ontologically\ncontext-dependent in the sense that in order for it to be well-defined\nthe specification of the observable it \u2018comes from\u2019 is\nnecessary. Thus, in order to construct a well-defined observable from\noperator\nf(Q) = g(P), we need\nto know whether it is physically realized via observable P or\nobservable Q. This way out of the KS problem, was first noted\n(but not advocated) by van Fraassen (1973). There are, then, as many\nobservables and kinds of physical properties for an operator\nf(Q) as there are ways to construct\nf(Q) from maximal operators. Without further\nexplanation, however, this idea just amounts to an ad hoc\nproliferation of physical magnitudes. A defender of ontological\ncontextuality certainly owes us a more explicit story about the\ndependence of observable f(Q) on observable\nQ. Two possibilities come to mind:\n\n\n(a) We might think that v(f(Q)) just is not\na self-sustained physical property, but one which ontologically\ndepends on the presence of another property\nv(Q). (Recall that in the proof of FUNC\nv(f(Q)) is constructed from\nv(Q).)  But, since the position does not reject\nquestions about values of f(Q) in a\nP-measurement situation as illegitimate (because it does not\ntrade on a notion of an observable being well-defined in one context\nonly!), this seems to lead to new and pressing questions, to say the\nleast. As an attempt to defend a contextualist hidden\nvariables interpretation, this position must concede that not\nonly does the system have, in the Q-measurement situation, a\nvalue v(Q), but also, in a P-measurement\nsituation, it has a value v\u2032(Q), although\nperhaps v\u2032(Q) \u2260\nv(Q). Now, questions for values of\nf(Q) in this situation at least are legitimate. Does\nv\u2032(Q) imply another\nv\u2032(f(Q)) \u2260\nv(f(Q))? Or does\nv\u2032(Q), in opposition to\nv(Q), not lead to a value of f(Q),\nat all? Neither option seems plausible, for could we not, just by\nswitching for a certain prepared system between a P- and\nQ-measurement situation either switch\nv(f(Q)) in and out of existence or switch\nbetween v(f(Q)) and\nv\u2032(f(Q))?  (b) We might think that,\nin order for f(Q) to be well-defined, one\nmeasurement arrangement rather than the other is necessary. The idea\nis strongly reminiscent of Bohr\u2019s 1935 argument against EPR, and\nindeed may be viewed as the appropriate extension of Bohr\u2019s views on\nQM to the modern HV discussion (see Held 1998, ch.7). In this version\nof ontological contextualism the property\nv(f(Q)), rather than depending on the\npresence of another property v(Q), is dependent on\nthe presence of a Q-measuring apparatus. This amounts to a\nholistic position: For some properties it only makes sense to speak of\nthem as pertaining to the system, if that system is part of a certain\nsystem-apparatus whole. Here, the question for values of\nf(Q) in a P-measurement situation does\nbecome illegitimate, since f(Q)\u2019s being well-defined\nis tied to a Q-measurement situation.  But again further\nclarification is required. Does the position hold that, in opposition\nto f(Q), Q itself is well-defined in a\nP-measurement situation? If it does not, Q can\nhardly have a value (since not being well-defined was the reason to\ndeny f(Q) a value), which means that we are not\nconsidering an HV interpretation of the given type any longer, and\nthat there is no need to block the KS argument at all. If it does,\nwhat explains that, in the P-measurement situation,\nQ remains well-defined, but f(Q) loses this\nstatus?\n\n\nWhat becomes of FM in both versions of ontological contextualism?\nWell, if we remain agnostic about how the position could be made\nplausible, we can save FM, while, if we choose version (a) or (b) to\nmake it plausible, we lose it. Consider first an agnostic denial of\nNC.  FM says that every QM observable is faithfully\nmeasured. Now, contextualism splits an operator which can be\nconstructed from two different noncommuting operators into two\nobservables, and ontological contextualism does not try to give us a\ncausal story which would ruin the causal independence of the measured\nvalue from the measurement interaction embodied in FM. We simply\nintroduce a more fine-grained conception of observables, but can still impose FM for\nthese new contextual observables.\n\n\nHowever, the concrete versions of ontological contextualism, by\nattempting to motivate the contextual feature, ruin FM. Version (a)\nallows f(Q) to be switched \u2018on and off\u2019\nor to switch between different values upon the change between\nP- and Q-measurement situations \u2014 which is a\nflagrant violation of FM. Version (b) fares no better. It introduces\nthe ontological dependence on the measuring arrangement. It is hard to\nsee what else this should be, but the same causal dependence pushed to\na higher, \u2018ontological\u2019 key.  Again, could we not, just by\nflipping back and forth the measurement arrangement, change back and\nforth whether f(Q) is well-defined, thus flip\nv(f(Q)) in and out of existence?\n\n\nFinally, we note that both types of ontological contextualism, in\nopposition to the causal version, do entail that system\nproperties which we earlier thought to be intrinsic become\nrelational in the sense that a system can only have these properties\neither if it has certain others, or if it is related to a certain\nmeasurement arrangement.\n",
