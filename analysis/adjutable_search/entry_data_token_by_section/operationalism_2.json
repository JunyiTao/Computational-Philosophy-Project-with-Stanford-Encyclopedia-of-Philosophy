His\nruminations on length were extended into general commentary on the\nnature of space, and the concept of time received a similar treatment.\nHis views on space and time were reminiscent of Henri\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s and Pierre Duhem\u2019s: Bridgman noted that\nclocks had to be used in the empirical determination of the basic laws\nof physics, while our confidence that a clock ticks regularly was\nfounded in the basic laws of physics governing its mechanism. Suppose\nwe are trying to test the general theory of relativity by measuring\nthe red-shift of light coming out of a heavy body:\n\nIf the vibrating atom is a clock, then the light of the sun is shifted\ntoward the infra-red, but how do we know that the atom is a clock\n(some say yes, others no)? If we find the displacement physically have\nwe thereby proved that general relativity is physically true, or have\nwe proved that the atom is a clock, or have we merely proved that\nthere is a particular kind of connection between the atom and the rest\nof nature, leaving the possibility open that neither is the atom a\nclock nor general relativity true? (Bridgman 1927, 72\u201373)\n\n\nBridgman found these reflections liberating as well as troubling.\nBasic space-time concepts are not uniquely determined a\npriori. For example, he noted that the notion of velocity common\nto classical mechanics and special relativity was not the only one in\nline with our intuitions of what velocity meant. Consider this\nalternative: \u201ca traveler in an automobile measures his velocity\nby observing the clock on his instrument board and the mile stones\nwhich he passes on the road.\u201d If we adopt such a procedure we\nwill find that the speed of light is infinite, if special relativity\nis correct about time dilation: with the car going at the speed of\nlight according to an observer standing on the road, the clock on the\ncar will not advance at all while the car passes any number of\nmilestones. This alternative concept of velocity would have the\nadvantage that \u201cthere would be no limit to the velocity which\ncan be imparted to material bodies on giving them unlimited\nenergy\u201d, which seems intuitively \u201cnatural and\nsimple\u201d. But assigning an infinite velocity to light is also\n\u201cmost unnatural, particularly if we favor a medium point of\nview.\u201d So there was a dilemma: \u201call sorts of phenomena\ncannot at the same time be treated simply.\u201d (Bridgman 1927,\n98\u2013100)\n\nIn the latter parts of The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman\ngave a fascinating array of discussions on the concepts of force,\nmass, energy, light and field, and the theories of thermodynamics,\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. These thoughts were developed\nfurther in the remaining decades of his life, and collected in\nsubsequent volumes including The Nature of Physical Theory\n(1936), The Nature of Thermodynamics (1941), Reflections\nof a Physicist (1950, second edition 1955), The Nature of\nSome of Our Physical Concepts (1952), and The Way Things\nAre (1959a). Bridgman made a searching examination of the\nfamiliar concepts of classical physics, checking to see if they\nretained operational meaning in domains of phenomena that were\nunfamiliar to the creators of classical physics. In some cases his\nanalysis showed that the classical concepts were operationally unsound\neven in the contexts in which they were originally created. Later in\nlife he stated that his initial foray into philosophy was motivated by\nhis \u201cdisquietude\u201d about physics, especially\nelectrodynamics and thermodynamics, in which \u201cthe fundamental\nunderstanding of even the acknowledged leaders in physics were\ninadequate\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 519). In contrast, he thought that\non the whole the contemporary development of quantum theory went in\nthe right direction, especially in Werner Heisenberg\u2019s version\nof it, which discarded classical concepts where they did not apply\n(e.g., space-time orbits for electrons), and crafted new concepts with\nclear operational meaning in new domains of phenomena. However, he was\nnot entirely satisfied with Niels Bohr\u2019s doctrine that all the\noperations of physics needed to be explained in the \u201cmacroscopic\nlanguage of daily life or of present-day philosophy\u201d; rather, he\nthought we needed to develop a \u201cmore adequate macroscopic\nlanguage\u201d (1959b, 526).\n\nInterestingly, Bridgman never stopped thinking about relativity. The\noperationalist lesson he had taken from Einstein was so dear to him\nthat he did not shrink from criticizing Einstein himself when the\nlatter seemed to betray his own principles in the general theory of\nrelativity. Already in The Logic of Modern Physics he had\nopined: \u201cI personally question whether the elements of\nEinstein\u2019s formulation, such as curvature of space-time, are\nclosely enough connected with immediate physical experience ever to be\naccepted as an ultimate in a scheme of explanation, and I very much\nfeel the need for a formulation in more intimate physical terms\u201d\n(1927, 176). Years later, when Bridgman was invited by P. A. Schilpp\nto contribute to the Library of Living Philosophers volume on\nEinstein, he issued the following \u201cindictment\u201d against\nEinstein: \u201che has carried into general relativity theory\nprecisely that uncritical, pre-Einsteinian point of view which he has\nso convincingly shown us, in his special theory, conceals the\npossibility of disaster\u201d (Bridgman 1949a, 354; reprinted in\nBridgman 1955, 337). Einstein brushed aside Bridgman\u2019s\nobjection, merely stating that for a formal system to qualify as a\nphysical theory it was \u201cnot necessary to demand that all of its\nassertions can be independently interpreted and \u2018tested\u2019\n\u2018operationally\u2019\u201d (Einstein in Schilpp 1949, 679).\nThis exchange is reminiscent of how Einstein responded with bemused\nincomprehension to Heisenberg\u2019s protest that he was following\nEinstein\u2019s own lesson in treating only directly observable\nquantities in his matrix mechanics (Heisenberg 1971, 62\u201369).\nBridgman also carried out further operational analysis of special\nrelativity, and his late thoughts on the subject were published\nposthumously in A Sophisticate\u2019s Primer on Relativity\n(1962).\n\nBridgman\u2019s critique of concepts in physics also led naturally to\na philosophical critique of some general conceptions underlying\nphysics, such as simplicity, atomism, causality, determinism, and\nprobability. He also gave critical considerations to mathematics and\nits application to the physical world. There was no stone Bridgman was\nwilling to leave unturned in his relentless critique. He went as far\nas to declare: \u201carithmetic, so far as it purports to deal with\nactual physical objects, is also affected with the same penumbra of\nuncertainty as all other empirical science\u201d (Bridgman 1927,\n34).\n\nAmong physicists Bridgman\u2019s reflections found a strong echo,\nespecially in the early days. Perhaps that was natural: it has been\nsaid, by Bridgman himself too, that operationalism arose from\nobserving \u201cphysicists in action\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956,\n80). Gerald Holton (1995a, 224) recalls what an \u201celectrifying\nexperience\u201d it was for himself and many other physicists to read\nThe Logic of Modern Physics for the first time, but explains\nthat the \u201cimmense power\u201d of Bridgman\u2019s work is\n\u201cnot that the work brings to the reader a message never thought\nof before, but that it lays open, with clarity, what the reader has\nbeen trying to formulate on his or her own\u201d. In Mary\nHesse\u2019s view Bridgman only gave \u201cthe most explicit\nformulation\u201d of a common view, which was shared even by Arthur\nEddington, whose metaphysical musings about physics Bridgman took a\nstrong exception to: \u201cA physical quantity is defined by the\nseries of operations and calculations of which it is the result\u201d\n(quoted in Hesse 1952, 218).\n\nBridgman\u2019s philosophical views, however, were not just an\narticulation of views widely shared by physicists. Albert E. Moyer\n(1991) stresses that Bridgman\u2019s operational analysis served the\nfunction of making special relativity and quantum mechanics more\npalatable by showing how they could be understood in a way that most\nphysicists could cope with. But the operational way of rendering the\nnew physics was not agreeable to all physicists (or philosophers of\nphysics), although it was consonant with the stances taken by some\nleaders in the field including Bohr, Heisenberg and Oppenheimer (Moyer\n1991, 376, 389). We have already seen Einstein\u2019s objections to\nBridgman\u2019s interpretation of relativity. Mario Bunge (1988)\nargues that operationalism is \u201cwritten into the standard (or\nCopenhagen) interpretation of the quantum theory\u201d, but that this\ninterpretation gives a clear misrepresentation of the actual practices\nin quantum physics. Analyzing Dirac\u2019s version of the theory,\nHesse (1952) concluded that concepts of quantum theory did not have\nsimple operational meanings, and Dirac\u2019s\n\u201cobservables\u201d were concepts without operational\ndefinitions. Rather, in Hesse\u2019s view, concepts in such\nsituations only derived their meanings from theoretical analogies.\n",
