    "main_text": "Medieval probability-related terminology || Probabilis\n2.1 Probabilis\n\nProbabilis was the most important probability-related\npredicate in the Middle Ages (and in the whole scholastic tradition).\nIt is often possible to translate probabilis as\n\u2018probable\u2019 in an ordinary language sense, but attention\nshould be paid to meanings arising from a combination with particular\nnouns. The predicate probabilis mainly pertained to\npropositions, sentences, or opinions, but these are not the only\nmeaningful referents. Sometimes persons were described as probable, as\nin the phrase \u201cthe more probable philosophers\u201d\n(philosophi probabiliores). Thomas Deman (1933, 262) renders\nthis phrase as \u201cthe philosophers who deserve most\nconsideration\u201d; but one could also translate it as \u201cthe\nphilosophers who are more likely to find the truth\u201d. Signs were\nalso sometimes called probable (signum probabile), as in\nSilvester de Prierio\u2019s Summa under the heading\n\u2018probabile\u2019. Last but not least, probability was\nattributed to events, for instance, when Thomas Aquinas, in Summa\ntheologiae II-II, q. 32, 5, 1322, says \u201caccording as things\nprobably and generally occur / according to what probably and\ngenerally occurs\u201d (secundum ea quae probabiliter et in\npluribus occurrunt). As we shall see, however, it is conceivable\nthat all these assertions are elliptic references to the probability\nof propositions.\n\nA proposition was probable (probabilis) if specific\nindicators of truth justified assent (i.e., holding it true) or\nacceptance as a premise for\n action.[4]\n The main justifications for judgments of probability will be\ndiscussed in more detail in Section 3, on \u201cScholastic Concepts\nof Probability\u201d. For the moment, it is enough to say that\nauthority, testimony, a sufficient (but not maximal) appearance of\ntruth, and frequent truth could buttress an ascription of\nprobability.\n\nThe most prolific category of probable propositions were opinions in\nthe medieval technical sense of this term. An opinion\n(opinio) was often defined as a proposition held to be true\nbut which the person holding it feared might be wrong (see Byrne 1968,\nFranklin 2001). This was only one of several medieval understandings\nof opinion. Robert Grosseteste (\u223c1175\u20131253) reminded his\nreaders that opinio could be understood in three\n ways.[5]\n According to the simplest meaning, opinion stood for any cognition\ncharacterized by assent; and, in this understanding, propositions\nexpressing knowledge or conviction were also opinions. According to a\nmore proper definition, opinion denoted assent to a proposition with a\nfear that the opposite might be true. Finally, according to the most\nprecise definitions, opinions were limited to contingent propositions\nto which assent was given and the opposite of which were somehow\nfeared to be true. Grosseteste\u2019s distinctions show that\nthirteenth-century scholastics were already aware that the term\nopinio was used far from uniformly by contemporary authors.\nThat said, it should nevertheless be kept in mind that medieval\ndiscussions of the use of probable opinions predominantly operated on\nthe basis of the second meaning of opinio as a proposition to\nwhich assent was given and which was accompanied by a fear that the\nopposite might be true. The fear in question resulted at least in part\nfrom an awareness that one\u2019s judgment might be fallible.\nAccording to a widely observed medieval ranking of epistemological\nconfidence and doxological firmness, the category of opinion stood\nbelow faith or full conviction (fides) and knowledge\n (scientia).[6]\n All three epistemic attitudes involved assent, but only faith and\nknowledge implied full subjective certainty (certitudo).\n\nOn this basis, \u201cprobable opinion\u201d (opinio\nprobabilis) became a standard term for a class of propositions\nheld to be true, which humans had to be content with in many fields of\ninvestigation. In these fields, human fallibility or the changeable\nnature of the subject matter precluded full knowledge\n(scientia), and a lack of religious relevance or accepted\ntheological contentiousness prevented the intervention of faith\n(fides). The scope of this domain was enormous. In\nphilosophical theory, it was the home-ground for dialectical\nargumentation and dialectical syllogisms (see Section 4.1); on a\npractical level, it was regulated by counselors of conscience and\nlawyers.\n\nFor the regulation of consciences, another standard term was\n\u2018probable certainty\u2019 (certitudo probabilis).\nProbable certainty forestalled sin by enabling one to base one\u2019s\nactions on correct probable reasoning. Since reasoning which went\nbeyond the probable was virtually unattainable in many moral contexts,\nan agent satisfied her or his epistemic duties by relying on sound\nprobable reasoning, thus acquiring a subjective certainty of having\ndone all that could be expected of an agent to avoid sin (Gardeil\n1911; Schuessler 2019, 47). In the opinion of many medieval\nscholastics, probable reasoning could not generate epistemological\ncertainty; the phrase \u201cprobable certainty\u201d, however,\nsprang from compliance with moral demands (which we would call\nepistemic duties today) and not from strong conviction based on\nevidence. Perhaps because of the risk of misunderstanding it implied,\n\u2018probable certainty\u2019 was largely supplanted, from the\nfifteenth century onward, by the similar concept of \u2018moral\ncertainty\u2019 (certitudo moralis), (Franklin 2001, 69;\nKnebel 2000, 55; Schuessler 2009).\n\nIn the field of jurisprudence, the term probabilis was\ntypically combined with presumptions (presumptiones). A\nprobable presumption for or against a culprit was one that in itself\ndid not suffice to incline a reasonable judge to a verdict (only\nvehement or violent presumptions could achieve that). Nevertheless,\nprobable presumptions had some juridical weight (in contrast to\ncareless presumptions, presumptiones temerariae) and could be\naggregated to justify a verdict (Franklin 2001, 43).\n\nIn the realm of economics, a distinct lexicon pertaining to\nrisk-taking, with terms such as risk (risicum) and danger of\nloss (periculum sortis) was in use, and institutions designed\nfor risk, such as insurance contracts, began to emerge\n(Ceccarelli 2001; Ceccarelli 2021; Zwierlein 2016). Economic risk\noften found itself associated with the concept of probability (Januard\n2023); and moral theological regulations for navigating doubt and\nprobability held normative implications for the legitimacy of engaging\nin economic risk-taking. It is important to note that this does not\nimply that the medieval era discouraged risk-taking. Particularly in\nthe late Middle Ages, engaging in economic risk did not necessarily\nentail moral failure or a likelihood of sin.\n",
