    "main_text": "Semantic Restrictions || Problems for Situations\n4.2 Problems for Situations\n\nSince the actuality operator rigidly designates actual\nsituations, the truth-value of statements of the form \\(\\A p\\) will\nnot vary across possible situations. \u2018\\(\\A p\\)\u2019 entails\n\u2018in every situation \\(\\A p\\)\u2019. Thus, as Edgington is\naware, if \\(\\A p\\) then it is necessary that \\(\\A p\\). This by\nitself poses a problem for EKP. The criticism is that Edgington\u2019s\napproach is not general enough. Anyone who is likely to endorse the\nknowability principle is likely to think that it holds of all truths,\nnot just those necessary truths involving the actuality operator. EKP\nappears to be a very limited thesis failing to specify an epistemic\nconstraint on contingent truth (Williamson 1987a).\n\nFurther criticisms emerge when we attempt to say something informative\nabout what constitutes non-actual knowledge of what is actually the\ncase. If there is such non-actual knowledge, there is non-actual\nthought about an actual situation. So the non-actual thinker somehow\nhas a concept of an actual situation. But how is it possible for a\nnon-actual thinker to have a concept that is specifically about\nsituations in this the actual world. It will not do for the thinker to\nexpress the thought \u2018actually \\(p\\)\u2019, since\n\u2018actually\u2019 will designate rigidly only situations in her\nown world. Moreover, since there is no causal link between the actual\nworld \\(w_1\\) and the relevant non-actual world\n\\(w_2\\), it is unclear how non-actual thought in\n\\(w_2\\) can be uniquely about \\(w_1\\)\n(Williamson, 1987a: 257\u2013258). Therefore, it is unclear how there\nmight be non-actual knowledge about what is actually the case.\n\nOf course actual knowledge about the non-actual is no better at\nsingling out worlds. The special problem for the non-actual knower is\nthat the content of her thought must be precisely the content that we\ngrasp when we consider the truth of \\(\\A p\\). Being in the actual\nworld we are able to single out this world uniquely. When we consider\nthe truth of \\(\\A p\\) our context fixes the content of A\nspecifically. So if it really is \\(\\A p\\) that is knowable by a\nnon-actual knower, then it must be \\(\\A p\\) that she\ngrasps\u2014that is, it must be the very same concept that we grasp.\nBut how this is possible is precisely the problem.\n\nRelated and additional criticisms of Edgington\u2019s proposal appear in\nWright (1987), Williamson (1987b; 2000b) and Percival (1991). Formal\ndevelopments on the proposal, including points that address some of\nthese concerns appear in Rabinowicz and Segerberg (1994),\nLindstr\u00f6m (1997), R\u00fcckert (2003), Edgington (2010), Fara\n(2010), Proietti and Sandu (2010), and Schl\u00f6der (forthcoming).\n",
