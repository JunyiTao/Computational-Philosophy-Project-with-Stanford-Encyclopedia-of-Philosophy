    "main_text": "Arnauld and Malebranche || Malebranche\u2019s position in the Treatise of Nature and Grace\n4.1 Malebranche\u2019s position in the Treatise of Nature and Grace\n\nTNG provides a general account of God\u2019s reasons for\ncreating a world with the evils that the world contains. But\nMalebranche is mainly interested in one particular evil, namely, that\nnot all men are saved. That not all men are saved he took to be a\ndatum of revelation, plainly expressed in the Scriptures. But he\ndenied that it follows that God does not want all men to be saved.\nIndeed, he says his motive in writing TNG was to refute those\nwho concluded that God did not have a \u201csincere will\u201d to\nsave all men:\n\nIf there were not in this century people determined to hold that God\ndoes not have a sincere will to save all men, it would not be\nnecessary to establish principles suitable for destroying that unhappy\nopinion. But the need to combat errors brings to light principles\nsuitable to that end. I protest before God that that was the principal\nmotive that made me\n write.[17]\n\n\nIf God wants to save all men, something must prevent Him from doing\nwhat He wants to do. In the \u201cTroisi\u00e8me\nEclaircissement\u201d to TNG, Malebranche says that\nsince God is omnipotent, He can bring about whatever He wants to bring\nabout. But because His will is \u201cthe love He bears for His own\nattributes,\u201d He cannot, by a \u201cpractical\u201d\n will,[18]\n will anything or will in any way that is not wise: \u201cThe wisdom\nof God renders Him impotent in this sense that it does not permit him\nto will certain things, or to act in certain ways\u201d (OM,\n5:180). What prevents God from carrying out His will to save all men,\nMalebranche concludes, must be that doing so would require ways or\nmanners of willing that are unwise. As he puts it a few pages later,\nGod\u2019s wisdom \u201cholds His volitions in check, in the sense\nthat not all of His volitions are practical volitions\u201d\n(OM, 5:184).\n\nMalebranche argues that God\u2019s wisdom restrains Him from\nsanctifying and saving all men because it directs Him not only to\ncreate a world that is good, but also to create \u201cin a way worthy\nof Him, by ways (par des voyes) that are simple, general,\nconstant, and uniform\u201d (OM, 5:49). More precisely,\nGod\u2019s wisdom directs Him to an act of creating that best\ncombines goodness or perfection of the created world with simplicity\nof ways of creating. An analogy may help explain Malebranche\u2019s\nposition. Suppose that someone sets out to buy a car and wants to do\nthe best possible job of car-buying. Suppose further that the\nsecond-best car is available at a much better price than the best car.\nIn this case, doing the best job of car-buying might require buying\nless than the best car. In a somewhat similar way, Malebranche holds\nthat the best job of creating, the one most worthy of God, involves\ncreating a world less perfect than He might have made it, in\nparticular, a world in which not all human beings are saved.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s notion of the simplicity of God\u2019s ways of\ncreating depends on his occasionalism. According to that theory of\nefficient causality, God is the only true efficient cause. When\ncreatures appear to be efficient causes, they are really only\noccasional causes. That is, the events in which the apparent created\ncauses take part are followed by other events in accordance with laws\nof nature, which are God\u2019s general volitions. But the created\n\u201ccauses\u201d do not really cause the events that follow. These\nevents, like every created reality, are really caused by\n God.[19]\n For Malebranche, the simplicity of God\u2019s ways depends on there\nbeing a small number of laws of nature, and on there being few\nexceptions to the laws. Malebranche maintains that in order to do the\njob of creating that best combines goodness of the world created with\nsimplicity of ways of creating, God had to make a world with precisely\nthe natural evils (misshapen animals, human suffering, ugly\nlandscapes, etc.) that that are present in the world as it is.\n\nThe anomalies in the order of grace are explained in a similar way.\nMalebranche divides grace, the divine assistance given to human\nbeings, into two kinds, which he calls \u201cgrace of light\n(lumi\u00e8re)\u201d and \u201cgrace of feeling\n(sentiment)\u201d (OM, 5:96\u201397; 131). The\nformer is, quite simply, knowledge. Malebranche also calls it\n\u201cthe grace of the Creator,\u201d because it is given, in\ndifferent forms, both to Adam and Eve and to human beings after their\nFall. Grace of feeling is \u201cthe grace of Jesus Christ,\u201d and\nwas merited for human beings by the life and death of Jesus.\nMalebranche also describes it as a \u201cpleasure\n(d\u00e9lectation)\u201d which makes a person love God\n(TNG, OM, 5:135). According to Malebranche, the\ngrace of the Creator is \u201cdry, abstract, entirely pure and\nentirely intelligible\u201d and does not lead us to love God. The\ngrace of Christ, in contrast, is \u201cefficace par\nelle-m\u00eame\u201d in that it \u201calways has its effect, always\ncarries us toward God\u201d (OM, 5:132). Human beings, after\nthe fall of Adam, are unable to grow in holiness, or even to be saved\nfrom damnation, without the grace of Christ. But the love of God\nproduced by grace is a sort of instinctive love, which is not\nmeritorious and is not sufficient for salvation. Whether the person\nwho receives the grace of Christ is saved depends on the\nperson\u2019s free consent to the movement toward God that grace\nproduces, which converts the instinctive love of God into a\n\u201cfree and rational\u201d love. This consent is not produced by\ngrace.\n\nNow Malebranche holds that God could give to each person grace that\nwould assure the person\u2019s salvation:\n\nGod is the master of hearts. He can give to the impious a grace such\nthat it will convert him, since God knows what degree of grace to\ngive, and when it must be given, in order that it bring about the\nconversion of the sinner (OM, 5:186).\n\n\nSimilarly, God knows what sort of grace would ensure that any person\nis not only saved, but also attains the maximum holiness of which he\nor she is capable. But many who receive grace do not grow in holiness\nand are not saved. For example, many who enter the Church later fall\naway.\n\nGod often distributes graces, without their having the effect that His\ngoodness makes us believe He would make them have. He makes the piety\nof some people increase right up to the end of their life, but sin\novercomes them at death and throws them into Hell. He makes the rain\nof grace fall upon hardened hearts as well as on earth that is\nprepared: people resist it and make it useless for their salvation.\n\u2026 How can that be reconciled with wisdom? (OM, 5:48).\n\n\nMalebranche\u2019s answer is that God\u2019s wisdom dictates that He\nact, in the distribution of both sorts of grace, according general\nvolitions determined by created occasional causes to particular\neffects. In the case of the grace of the Creator, the general\nvolitions are laws of nature, and the occasional causes are \u201cthe\ndiverse movements of our will\u201d and \u201cthe encounter of\nsensible objects that act on our mind\u201d (TNG, 5:102).\nFor the grace of Jesus Christ, the occasional cause is Jesus Christ,\nin his human nature, and the general volition is that grace be given\nto human beings if and only if Jesus, in his human nature, asks that\nit be given. Jesus\u2019 requests for grace are made in view of the\nneeds of the Church. But Jesus, in his human nature, does not always\nthink of \u201cthe future determination of the will\u201d of those\nfor whom he requests grace. The result is that, often enough, people\nreceive grace that does not lead to their holiness and salvation, or\nfail to receive the grace that would have done so (TNG,\nOM, 5:83).\n",
