    "main_text": "Sexual Equality || Rebutting the Case for Inequality\n5.2 Rebutting the Case for Inequality\n\nMill considers and replies to various actual and possible defenses of\nsexual inequality. In most cases, the apologist for inequality alleges\nthat women are naturally inferior in relation to men along some\ndimension that is alleged to be relevant to the proper management of\npersonal and public affairs. For the most part, the apologist claims\nthat men possess some trait essential for normative competence that\nwomen lack\u2014these might be represented as alleged female\ndeficits\u2014or that women possess some trait that men lack\nthat threatens normative competence\u2014these might be represented\nas alleged female disqualifiers. In either case, the\napologist argues, it turns out that women are naturally inferior and\nso do not deserve equal treatment.\n\nMill considers a large list of potential natural differences, not\nrestricted to deficits and disqualifiers, including claims that women\nare (1) more intuitive and practical, less principled and theoretical,\nthan men (305), (2) more focused on particulars, less capable of\nabstraction or generalization, than men (306), (3) more nervous and\nexcitable than men (308), (4) less single-minded than men (310), (5)\nless accomplished in philosophy, science, and art than men\n(313\u201314), (6) less original than men (314\u201315), (7) morally\nsuperior to men (320\u201321), (8) more susceptible to personal bias\nthan men (321), (9) more pacific and less aggressive than men\n(329\u201330), (10) more philanthropic than men (330), and (11) more\nself-sacrificing and self-abnegating than men (293).\n\nMill\u2019s response to these alleged differences is mixed.\nSometimes, he questions whether the traits in question are unevenly\ndistributed. But, for the most part, he seems to concede that the\ntraits are unevenly distributed. He doesn\u2019t always agree that\nthe female trait is a deficit or disqualifier. For instance, he thinks\nthat being more intuitive, more practical, more focused on\nparticulars, and less rigid allows women to compensate for deficits in\nthe way that men typically approach decision-making. Women are less\nlikely to follow principle for its own sake and are more likely to\ntest principles by their real world consequences. They are better able\nto multi-task and intellectually more open-minded. Being morally\nsuperior and less aggressive are unqualified goods. However, he seems\nto concede that women are more excitable, less accomplished, and less\noriginal than men. He tries to explain these deficits and\ndisqualifiers in ways that do not presuppose women\u2019s natural\ninferiority.\n\nMill\u2019s primary response to the apologists is to claim that even\nif the trait is unevenly distributed and functions as a deficit or\ndisqualifier there is nonetheless no evidence of natural inferiority.\nThere is no evidence of natural inferiority, because we cannot be sure\nthat the incapacity is the product of nature, rather than nurture. In\nparticular, because the history of sexual relations has been\ndiscriminatory, we cannot rule out the possibility that female\nincapacity is the product of past discriminatory treatment\n(275\u201377, 304\u201305, 313).\n\n\nI consider it a presumption in any one to pretend to decide what women\nare or are not, can or cannot be, by natural constitution. They have\nalways hitherto been kept, as far as regards spontaneous development,\nin so unnatural a state, that their nature cannot but have been\ngreatly distorted and disguised; and no one can safely pronounce that\nif women\u2019s nature were left to choose its direction as freely as\nmen\u2019s, and if no artificial bent were attempted to be given to\nit except that required by the conditions of human society, and given\nto both sexes alike there would be any material difference, or perhaps\nany difference at all, in the character and capacities that would\nunfold themselves. (304\u201305)\n\n\nMill rightly insists that incapacity that is the product of\ndiscriminatory treatment cannot be appealed to justify that\ndiscrimination. That would be circular reasoning.\n\nMill can explain differential accomplishments in philosophy, science,\nand the arts by appeal to social barriers to women\u2019s\nparticipation in these fields (313\u201318) and to competing domestic\ndemands that are placed on them (318\u201319). In this connection, it\nis worth noting that Mill can concede not only differential\naccomplishments of the sexes but differential capacity, in at least\none sense. For Mill can and should distinguish between actual\ncapacity and potential capacity. Actual capacities determine\nwhat an agent is now able to do, whereas potential capacities\ndetermine what actual capacities she can develop. For instance, I have\nno actual capacity to speak Russian, but presumably I do have a\npotential capacity to speak Russian. By contrast, I don\u2019t have\neven a potential capacity to fly or run a three-minute mile. Actual\ncapacities are a function of potential capacities and suitable\ntraining, opportunities, and responsibilities. If I have not been\ngiven a proper education and training with suitable deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities at various points in my\ndevelopment, my potential competence may not be actualized. Even if\neveryone had equal potential capacities, we should expect unequal\nactual capacities in systems where education and deliberative\nopportunities and responsibilities have been distributed unequally. If\nso, then greater actual capacity would not be evidence of greater\npotential capacity.\n\nThe moral that Mill draws is that equal rights should prevail in the\nabsence of any good evidence about the way in which natural assets and\npotential capacities are distributed by gender. Equality is the\npresumption, even if it is a rebuttable presumption, and the\npresumption can only be rebutted on the basis of adequate empirical\nevidence (262).\n",
