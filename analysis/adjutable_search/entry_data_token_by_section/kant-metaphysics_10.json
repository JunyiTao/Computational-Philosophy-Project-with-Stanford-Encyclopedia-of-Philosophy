    "main_text": "God and Rational Theology || The Other Proofs\n5.2 The Other Proofs\n\nIf the ontological argument seeks to move from the concept of the\nens realissimum to the concept of an absolutely necessary\nbeing, both the cosmological and physicotheological proofs move in the\nopposite direction. Each, that is, argues that there is something that\nmust exist with absolute necessity and concludes that this being is\nthe ens realissimum. Because these proofs aim to identify the\nens realissimum with the necessary being, and because the\nattempt to do this requires an a priori argument (it cannot\nbe demonstrated empirically), Kant thinks that they are both\n(ultimately) vitiated by their reliance on the ontological proof. More\nspecifically, they are both mitigated by their assumption that the\nens realissimum is the only object or candidate that can do\nthe job of existing necessarily. Since he thinks that the ontological\nargument is in some sense implicitly relied upon in making such a\nclaim, these arguments stand or fall with it. On Kant\u2019s view, as\nwe shall see, they fall.\n\nThe cosmological proof has, according to Kant, two parts. As\nabove, the proponent of the argument first seeks to demonstrate the\nexistence of an absolutely necessary being. Second, the rational\ncosmologist seeks to show that this absolutely necessary being is the\nens realissimum.\n\nAs Kant formulates it, the cosmological argument is as follows:\n\n\nIf something exists, then an absolutely necessary being must also\nexist.\n\nI myself, at least, exist.\n\nTherefore an absolutely necessary being exists.\n\n\nAs above, the theist will ultimately want to identify this necessary\nbeing with the ens realissimum, an identification which Kant\nthinks surreptitiously smuggles in the (dialectical) ontological\nargument. The claim here is that the proponent of the cosmological\nargument is committed ultimately to accepting the ontological\nargument, given her attempt to identify the necessary being with the\nens realissimum. Although this suggests that the cosmological\nargument relies on the ontological, Kant also indicates that the\neffort to produce a purely a priori argument for God\u2019s\nexistence (the ontological argument) itself gets momentum from\nreason\u2019s need to find the necessary ground for existence in\ngeneral, a need expressed in the cosmological argument (cf.\nA603\u201304/B631\u201332). This suggests that Kant takes the\nontological and cosmological arguments to be complementary expressions\nof the one underlying rational demand for the unconditioned.\n\nEven aside from its alleged commitment to the ontological argument,\nKant has a number of complaints about the cosmological argument.\nIndeed, according to Kant, the cosmological argument is characterized\nby an \u201centire nest of dialectical presumptions\u201d which must\nbe illuminated and \u201cdestroyed\u201d (A609/B637). These\ndialectical presumptions include the attempt to infer from the\ncontingent (within experience) to some cause lying outside the world\nof sense altogether, an effort involving a transcendental\nmisapplication of the categories. It also includes, Kant claims, the\ndialectical effort to infer from the conceptual impossibility\nof an infinite series of causes to some actual first cause\noutside of sense. Such efforts involve a \u201cfalse\nself-satisfaction\u201d according to which reason feels itself to\nhave finally landed on a truly necessary being. Unfortunately,\naccording to Kant, this is only achieved by conflating the merely\nlogical possibility of a concept (that it is not\nself-contradictory) with the transcendental (real)\npossibility of a thing. In short, the cosmological argument\ngets its momentum by confusing rational or subjective necessities with\nreal or objective ones, and thus involves transcendental illusion (cf.\nA605/B633).\n\nWe come finally to the physicotheological proof, which argues\nfrom the particular constitution of the world, specifically its\nbeauty, order, and purposiveness, to the necessary existence of an\nintelligent cause (God). Such an argument goes beyond the cosmological\none by moving not from existence in general but from some\ndeterminate experience in order to demonstrate the existence\nof God (A621/B649). Although this might seem to be a strength, this\nstrategy is doomed to fail, according to Kant. No experience could\never be adequate to the idea of a necessary, original being:\n\u201cThe transcendental idea of a necessary all-sufficient original\nbeing is so overwhelmingly great, so sublimely high above everything\nempirical, which is at all times conditioned, that partly one can\nnever even procure enough material in experience to fill such a\nconcept, and partly if one searches for the unconditioned among\nconditioned things, then one will seek forever and always in\nvain\u201d (A621/B649).\n\nKant\u2019s claim is that even if we could grant that the order and\npurposiveness of nature gives us good reason to suppose some\nintelligent designer, it does not warrant the inference to an ens\nrealissimum. At most, Kant tells us, the proof could establish a\n\u201chighest architect of the world\u2026., but not a creator of\nthe world.\u201d (A627/B655). The last inference, that to the ens\nrealissimum, is only drawn by moving far away from any\nconsideration of the actual (empirical) world. In other words, here\ntoo, Kant thinks that the rational theologist is relying on a\ntranscendental (a priori) argument. Indeed, according to\nKant, the physicotheological proof could never, given its empirical\nstarting point, establish the existence of a highest being by itself\nalone, and must rely on the ontological argument at crucial stages\n(cf. A625/B653). Since, according to Kant, the ontological argument\nfails, so does the physicotheological one.\n\nAlthough Kant rejects the physiciotheological argument as a\ntheoretical proof for God\u2019s existence, he also sees in it a\npowerful expression of reason\u2019s need to recognize in nature\npurposive unity and design (cf. A625/B651). In this, the\nphysicotheological argument\u2019s emphasis on the purposiveness and\nsystematic unity of nature illuminates an assumption that Kant takes\nto be essential to our endeavors in the natural sciences. The\nessential role played by the assumption of purposive and systematic\nunity, and the role it plays in scientific inquiries, is taken up by\nKant in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic. To this topic we\nnow turn.\n\nFor some discussions of the Ideal of Pure Reason and Rational\nTheology, see Caimi (1995).
