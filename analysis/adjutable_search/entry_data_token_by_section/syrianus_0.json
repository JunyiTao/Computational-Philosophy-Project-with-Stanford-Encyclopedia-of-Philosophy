    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nDamascius, in his Philosophical History (aka Life of\nIsidore) describes Syrianus as a strikingly handsome and tall man\nwith impressive intellectual powers. The son of an otherwise unknown\nPhiloxenus, he grew up in Alexandria, where he must have received an\neducation in rhetoric and perhaps some philosophy. In the second half\nof the 4th century, Alexandria had become increasingly\nburdened by strife between her pagan elite and a notoriously\nquarrelsome Christian populace. The mathematician Theon of Alexandria\n(c. 335\u2013405) and his daughter Hypatia, who was killed by\nagitating Christians in 415, were the most prominent pagan\nintellectuals in Alexandria during Syrianus\u2019 life. We do not\nknow when exactly Syrianus decided to go to Athens to study with\nPlutarch and to dedicate himself to philosophy; it appears, however,\nthat Syrianus spent the rest of his active life in Athens as a close\nassociate of Plutarch and, eventually, as his successor. If the\nattribution of the commentary on Hermogenes is correct (see section 3b\nbelow), we may infer that Syrianus was married, since that commentary\nis dedicated to its author\u2019s son Alexander. Archeological\nevidence suggests that Plutarch and Syrianus, and later Proclus, lived\nand taught in a complex of houses near the theater of Dionysus at the\nsouth slope of the Acropolis, not at the site now known as the\noriginal location of Plato\u2019s Academy outside the ancient\ncity\u2019s walls. According to Marinus (in his Life of\nProclus, 36), Syrianus was buried on the slopes of Mount\nLycabettus in Athens.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the political and cultural landscape of the Roman\nEmpire changed dramatically and irrevocably for pagan intellectuals,\nand it did so in disturbing ways. Politically, the Roman Empire was\nshaken to its foundation by the massive incursion of Gothic tribes\ninto northern Greece (Thrace) and their decisive victory over the\nimperial army at Adrianople (modern Edirne) in 378. Under Theodosius\nI, who reigned from 379 to 395, Christianity became the state\nreligion, and in order to strengthen the adopted Nicene orthodoxy, the\nemperor sought to curtail heresy of any form, both Christian and\npagan.\n\nIn 425, a few years before Syrianus assumed leadership of the Academy,\nemperor Theodosius II and his wife Eudocia (a well-educated Christian\nconvert and daughter of Leontius, a pagan educator at Athens who was\nin a sense a colleague of Syrianus\u2019) founded what came to be the\nUniversity of Constantinople. In consequence, higher education in\nRhetoric, Law and Philosophy was thereby placed under the\npatronage\u2014and supervision\u2014of the court. The survival of a\nprivate institution such as the Athenian School, in contrast, depended\nmuch on the capability, personality, and commitment of its individual\nmembers. It is in this context that we have to understand the sense of\nexcitement and relief that prevailed (as Marinus relates in his\nLife of Proclus) when Proclus (410/2\u2013485), a young\ncommitted pagan intellectual, arrived in Athens to join the school in\n431. At first, Syrianus was suspicious of the new arrival, but when he\nobserved Proclus openly worshiping the Moon, he agreed to accept him.\nEventually, Marinus says, Syrianus \u201cfound in him the disciple\nand successor he had long been looking for\u201d (Life 12).\nProclus succeeded Syrianus as head of the School in 437, at the mere\nage of about twenty-six, while Syrianus\u2019 other, most talented\nstudent Domninus, who was Jewish, returned to his home town\nLarissa.\n\nFrom Marinus we can gather some further evidence about Syrianus as a\nteacher. Whereas Plutarch had introduced the \u201cfreshman\u201d\nProclus to somewhat more accessible works such as Aristotle\u2019s\nDe anima and Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Syrianus, once he\nhad taken over instruction from Plutarch, subjected Proclus to a much\nmore rigorous and systematic philosophical training. In quick\nsuccession, they read practically the entire Aristotelian corpus\ntogether (\u201cAristotle\u2019s treatises on logic, ethics,\npolitics, physics and \u2026 theology,\u201d presumably in that\norder) in preparation for the study of Plato and, eventually, the\nOrphic Poems and Chaldaean Oracles. Syrianus gave Aristotle a firm\nplace and function in the philosophical-theological curriculum of a\nstudent of Platonism; however, as we shall see, this yoking together\nof Aristotle to Plato did not entail endorsement of the doctrine that\nthe views of the two ancestral philosophers were in complete harmony.\n\n",
