    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Self-Interest Theories: Critical Phase in the Enquiry\n7.3 Self-Interest Theories: Critical Phase in the Enquiry\n\nHume\u2019s second Enquiry is a sustained and systematic\nattack on the \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201cself-love\u201d\ntheories of Hobbes and Mandeville. He follows Hutcheson in thinking\nthat they assign two distinct roles to self-interest in their accounts\nof morality: first, moral approval and disapproval are based in a\nconcern for our own interest and, second, the motive of which we\nultimately approve is self-interest. Although many people during this\nperiod understood Hobbes\u2019 theory through Mandeville\u2019s\nlens, Hume believes it is important to distinguish them. As he sees\nit, Mandeville\u2019s theory is superficial and easily dismissed.\nHobbes is his main opponent.\n\nHume\u2019s rejection of Hobbes\u2019 selfish account of approval\nand disapproval begins in Section II and ends in Part I of the\n\u201cConclusion\u201d of the Enquiry. Like Hutcheson, he\nmistakenly supposes that Hobbes was offering a rival theory of\napproval and disapproval. We approve of people\u2019s character\ntraits when they benefit us and disapprove of them when they harm us.\nHume looks at each of the four types of virtue and argues that in each\ncase, our approval does not spring from a concern for our own\nhappiness, but rather from sympathy.\n\nIn Section II, Hume argues that one reason we approve of benevolence,\nhumanity, and public spiritedness is that they are useful to others\nand to society. In Sections III and IV, he argues that the sole ground\nfor approving of justice and political allegiance is that they are\nuseful to society. In Section V, he asks: But useful for whom? Since\nit is obvious that it has to be \u201cfor some body\u2019s\ninterest\u201d, the question is \u201cWhose interest then?\u201d He\nassumes there are only two possibilities: approval and disapproval\nspring either from sentiments that are interested or from a\ndisinterested source.\n\nAccording to Hume, Hobbes\u2019 \u201cdeduction of morals from\nself-love\u201d begins with our realization that we cannot subsist\nalone. A social order provides security, peace, and mutual protection,\nconditions that allow us to promote our own interests better than if\nwe lived alone. Our own good is thus bound up with the maintenance of\nsociety. Although Hume agrees with Hobbes up to this point, he rejects\nhis explanation that we approve of justice, benevolence, and humanity\nbecause they promote our own happiness.\n\nHume is confident that \u201cthe voice of nature and\nexperience\u201d will show that Hobbes\u2019 theory, understood in\nthis way, is mistaken. Borrowing many of Hutcheson\u2019s arguments,\nhe points out that if approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout the possible advantages and disadvantages to us of\npeople\u2019s characters and actions, we would never feel approval\nand disapproval of people from \u201cvery distant ages and remote\ncountries\u201d, since they cannot possibly affect us. We would never\nadmire the good deeds of our enemies or rivals, since they are hurtful\nto us. We would also never approve or disapprove of characters\nportrayed in novels or movies, since they are not real people and\ncannot possibly help or harm us. We approve of character traits and\nactions that are useful not because they benefit us, but because we\nsympathize with the benefits they bestow on others or society.\n\nHume next examines the remaining three types of character\ntraits\u2014those that are useful to the agent (industriousness, good\njudgment), agreeable to the agent (cheerfulness) or agreeable to\nothers (politeness, decency). Why, for example, do we approve of\nindustriousness and good judgment, character traits that are primarily\nadvantageous to the possessor? In most cases they are of absolutely no\nbenefit to us and, in cases of rivalry, they counteract our own\ninterest. We approve of these character traits not because they are\nbeneficial to us, but because we sympathize with the benefits they\nconfer on others. Hume takes this as further evidence against\nHobbes\u2019 explanation in terms of self-interest and in support of\nhis sympathy-based account.\n\nIn Part I of the \u201cConclusion\u201d, Hume complains that\nHobbes\u2019 self-love theory is unable to explain two important\nfeatures of our moral sentiments: we tend to approve of the same sorts\nof character traits and we are able to morally evaluate anyone, at any\ntime or place. If our approval and disapproval were based on thoughts\nabout our own benefits and harms, the moral sentiments would vary from\nperson to person and for the same person over time. We wouldn\u2019t\nhave moral feelings about most people, since most people don\u2019t\naffect us. The moral sentiments spring from our capacity to respond\nsympathetically to others.\n\nHume is equally adamant that any explanation of the motives that\nprompt us to virtuous actions in terms of self-interest is mistaken.\nHe opposes them in Appendix II of the Enquiry, which was\noriginally part of Section II, \u201cOf Benevolence\u201d. He\nfollows Hutcheson in thinking that the issue is whether the various\nbenevolent affections are genuine or arise from self-interest. Once\nagain he distinguishes Mandeville\u2019s from Hobbes\u2019\nexplanations of benevolence and takes Hobbes to be his main opponent.\nOn Hume\u2019s reading of Hobbes, while we approve of kindness,\nfriendship, and other benevolent affections, any desire to benefit\nothers really derives from self-interest, although we may not always\nbe conscious of its influence on those desires.\n\nHume offers two arguments against this selfish view. He first asks us\nto consider cases in which people are motivated by a genuine concern\nfor others, even when such concern could not possibly benefit them and\nmight even harm them. We grieve when a friend dies, even if the friend\nneeded our help and patronage. How could our grief be based in\nself-interest? Parents regularly sacrifice their own interests for the\nsake of their children. Non-human animals care about members of their\nown species and us. Is their concern a \u201cdeduction\u201d of\nself-interest? He concludes that these and \u201ca thousand other\ninstances \u2026 are marks of a general benevolence in human nature,\nwhere no interest binds us\u201d (EPM App 2.11/300).\n\nHume supplements this argument from experience with a highly\ncompressed sketch of an argument he borrows from Butler. Happiness\nconsists in the pleasures that arise from the satisfaction of our\nparticular appetites and desires. It is because we want food, fame,\nand other things that we take pleasure in getting them. If we did not\nhave any particular appetites or desires, we would not want anything\nand there would be nothing from which we would get pleasure. To get\nthe pleasures that self-love aims at, we must want something other\nthan happiness itself.\n",
