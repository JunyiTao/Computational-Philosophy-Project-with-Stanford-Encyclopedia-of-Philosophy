    "main_text": "Logic and method || Judgment\n3.3 Judgment\n\nRamus wanted to carry on from where Agricola had left off. So, he\nadded to inventio the other part of logic, iudicium.\nAlthough it never received as much attention as inventio,\niudicium became very controversial in Ramus\u2019 account,\nand he therefore made large changes to his presentation of it. His\nmost detailed discussion of iudicium was in the 1566 edition\nof the Dialectica, but this was neither the most read nor the\nmost important edition. The shorter version, published in 1572, was\nmore suitable for schools and was therefore followed in most later\neditions. In the 1572 edition there are 32 chapters devoted to\ninventio and only 20 to iudicium. Every chapter was\ncarefully constructed with questions and definitions of the main\nproblems and with examples, mostly taken from ancient authors.\n\nIn his first treatise on logic, Dialecticae institutiones\n(1543) Ramus had divided iudicium into three parts:\nsyllogistic, method and a kind of doctrine of ideas. The third part\nwas an odd element added in order to demonstrate that logic had a\ndivine origin; three years later it was removed, never to return.\nThereafter, he adopted a two-fold division of iudicium into\nthe axiomaticum and the dianoeticum. In the former\npart students learnt to organize the arguments found in\ninventio into a proposition or\u2014as Stoics and even Ramus\npreferred to call it\u2014an axioma. The second part of\niudicium, the dianoeticum, was divided into\nsyllogistic and method. The most remarkable aspect of his treatment of\nsyllogistic was that Ramus admitted a syllogismus\nexpositorius, in which the conclusion did not have to be about\nsomething universal but could be about something individual, as we can\nsee from the example: \n\n\nSocrates is a philosopher; he is also a human being; consequently,\nthere is at least one human being who is a philosopher. (Ramus,\nDialectica 1623: 71) \n\n This type of conclusion would nowadays seem unscientific and\narbitrary; but the fact that Ramus included it tells us something\nabout his attitude toward logic. As we have seen, he thought that it\nwas basically a natural way to think, and he was determined to make it\nuseful for the humanities (\u00a7 1.4). Given the Aristotelian demand that\na scientific conclusion should always be universal, it was extremely\ndifficult to deal with the uniqueness of history and literature in a\nscientific framework. This syllogism was an attempt to cope with that\ndifficulty. But it also reveals Ramus\u2019 lack of interest in the\nproblem of how to acquire new knowledge. It shows that his aim was\ninstead to systemize and organize arguments. For Ramus, therefore,\nmethod became the most important part of logic.\n",
