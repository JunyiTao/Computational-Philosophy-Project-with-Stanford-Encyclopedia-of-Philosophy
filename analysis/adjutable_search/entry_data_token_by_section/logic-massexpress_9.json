    "main_text": "Collective and non-collective construals, coverings\n8. Collective and non-collective construals, coverings\n\n\nAccording to Gillon (1992), a sentence containing a mass noun may\nreceive so-called \u201ccollective\u201d and\n\u201cdistributive\u201d construals, modulo the meaning of the\nparticular lexical items composing the sentence, context of speech and\nknowledge of the world. (Sentences containing plurals also receive such\nconstruals. This is well documented by Gillon (1992, 1996) and\nSchwarzschild (1996). This may be confirmed by replacing mass nouns\nwith plurals in the examples we give below.)\n\n\nTake the following sentence: This silverware costs a hundred\neuros. The sentence may be true if the silverware costs,\naltogether, a hundred euros: this is the collective construal of the\nsentence. It may be true if each piece of silverware, by itself, costs\na hundred euros: this is the distributive construal. It may also be\ntrue if the silverware demonstrated consists in two sets of silverware,\neach set of silverware costing, by itself, a hundred euros: this may be\ncalled an \u201cintermediate\u201d construal.\n\n\nA partly similar range of construals is observed with a mass noun\nlike wine: This wine costs a hundred euros. A\ncollective construal would assert that the wine, altogether, costs a\nhundred euros. A non-collective construal may be obtained, for\ninstance, when the wine demonstrated consists of two cases of wine. The\nspeaker could then assert that each case of wine costs a hundred euros.\nWhat about a distributive construal of the sentence? In fact, this\nnotion does not apply in this case, since a mass noun like\nwine has no linguistically specified minimal part.\n\n\nTherefore, the distinction that concerns all mass nouns is not that\nbetween collective and distributive construals (nor that between\ncollective, distributive and intermediate readings), but rather, that\nbetween collective and non-collective construals. What happens is that,\nin the specific case of mass nouns like silverware, one can\nidentify, among the non-collective construals, one reading that may be\ncalled distributive and other readings that may be called\nintermediate.\n\n\nThe specific meanings of the verbal expression and its arguments,\ncombined with knowledge of the world and context of speech, may render\na type of construal more, or less, plausible. In particular,\nnon-collective, \u201cintermediate\u201d construals may be harder to\nget than the collective reading, or than the \u201cdistributive\u201d\nreading if there is one. Such construals require specific information\nabout the context in order to become available. They are often easier\nto get when the verb has several arguments, as in the following example\ndue to Gillon (1992): This fruit was wrapped in that paper. A\nnon-collective, \u201cintermediate\u201d construal with respect to\nits first argument (this fruit) would be one where there are\nseveral pieces of paper, each enclosing several pieces of fruit.\n\n\nIn the examples we have given so far (as well as in those considered\nby Gillon), non-collective construals always correspond to partitions\nof the denotation of the mass noun phrase. However, some\ninterpretations correspond to a more general notion, that of a\n\u201ccovering\u201d: a set X is a covering of a set Y just in case\nthe sum of the elements of X is identical with the sum of the elements\nof\n Y.[18]\nThus, with This\nlivestock carried that furniture, it may be that some pieces of\nfurniture were repeatedly part of the furniture carried by some of the\nlivestock. The relation of carrying thus applies between elements of a\ncovering of [this livestock] and elements of a covering of\n[that furniture]. So it seems that the semantics of mass nouns\nshould leave room, not only for partitions, but also for all kinds\nof\n coverings.[19]\n\n\nLet us now see how Gillon (1992, 1996, 2012) accounts for these\ndata. We follow him quite closely, but introduce a few technical\nmodifications to ensure that everything works.\n\n\nThe denotation of a mass noun M is the set [M]\nthat has for elements everything that is M (a join semi-lattice). This\nis needed in order to specify correctly the truth-conditions of\n This is M:[20]\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2286\n[M],\n\nwhere [this] is the set having for sole member the sum of\nwhat is demonstrated.\n\n\nA set Y is an M-covering of a\nset Z just in case these two conditions are satisfied:\n\nY is a subset of [M]: Y \u2286\n[M].\nThe sum of the elements of Y is identical to the sum of the\nelements of Z.\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of sentences like the following depends on the\nchoice of an M-covering of the\nnoun\u2019s\n denotation.[21]\nRelative to this\nchoice of covering C:\n\nThe M P is true iff C \u2286 [P]\nSome M P is true iff C \u2229 [P] \u2260\n\u2205\nAll M P is true iff C \u2229 [P] = C\n\nGillon doesn\u2019t extend his account to other quantified\nstatements. However, this is easily done, following section 6. Thus,\none may define the measure of a set E:\n\n\u03bc(E) =def \u03bc(\u2228E),\n\nwhere \u2228E is the sum of the\nelements of E.\n\n\nAnd propose that:\n\nMost M P is true iff \u03bc(C \u2229 [P]) \u2265\n\u03bc(C) / 2\n\nAnd similarly for the other quantifiers whose interpretation involve\na measure.\nRemark: For Gillon, each choice\nof covering determines a specific interpretation of the sentence. The\nsentence is thus many-ways ambiguous. Schwarzschild (1996) offers a\ndetailed defense for a similar position in the case of plurals (see also Champollion 2017). But\nthe view also has opponents, like Lasersohn (1995). Among the\nalternatives, one could propose that a sentence of the form The M\nP is true just in case there exists a covering C of\n[M] such that C \u2286 [P]. The sentence\nwouldn\u2019t be ambiguous but indeterminate with respect to coverings. A\nproblem is that this wouldn\u2019t predict the distributive / collective\nambiguity, which does seem real (see Gillon 1992 for evidence).\n",
