    "main_text": "\n\nIn the history of Western aesthetics, the subject matters that\nreceived attention ranged from natural objects and phenomena, built\nstructures, utilitarian objects, and human actions, to what is today\nregarded as the fine arts. However, beginning with the nineteenth\ncentury, the discourse has become increasingly focused on the fine\narts. This narrowing attention occurred despite the prominence of the\naesthetic attitude theory in modern aesthetics, according to which\nthere is virtually no limit to what can become a source of aesthetic\nexperience. The tendency to equate aesthetics with the philosophy of\nart became widespread in twentieth century aesthetics, particularly\nwithin the Anglo-American tradition.\n\nChallenges to this rather limited scope of aesthetics began during the\nlatter half of the twentieth century with a renewed interest in nature\nand environment, followed by the exploration of popular arts. Everyday\naesthetics continues this trajectory of widening scope by including\nobjects, events, and activities that constitute people\u2019s daily\nlife. However, it is more accurate to characterize this recent\ndevelopment as restoring the scope of aesthetics rather than\nopening a new arena.\n\nIn addition, many cultural traditions outside the Western sphere have\nlong been concerned with the aesthetics of daily life. In some\ncultural traditions, such as Inuit and Navajo, aesthetic\nconsiderations are thoroughly integrated in daily activities,\nincluding making things such as tools (Papanek 1995; Witherspoon\n1996). Even in other traditions, such as Japanese and Chinese, with\ndistinctive art-making practices of paintings, literature, theater,\nand the like, aesthetic practices permeate people\u2019s daily life.\nOne of the findings of comparative aesthetics is that a greater\nemphasis is placed on the aesthetics of everyday life in many\nnon-Western cultures than in the West (Higgins 2005).\n\nThus, the perception that everyday aesthetics is a new frontier of\naesthetics discourse needs to be situated in the context of late\ntwentieth-century Anglo-American aesthetics. That is, it was\nestablished as a reaction against what was considered to be an undue\nrestriction on the scope of aesthetics. It aims to give due regard to\nthe entirety of people\u2019s multi-faceted aesthetic life, including\nvarious ingredients of everyday life: artifacts of daily use, chores\naround the house, interactions with other people, and quotidian\nactivities such as eating, walking, and bathing. Everyday aesthetics\nalso seeks to liberate aesthetic inquiry from an almost exclusive\nfocus on beauty (and to a certain extent sublimity) characteristic of\nmodern Western aesthetics. It includes within its purview those\nqualities that pervade everyday experience, such as pretty, cute,\nmessy, gaudy, tasteful, dirty, lively, monotonous, to name only a few.\nThese items and qualities are characterized by their ubiquitous\npresence in the daily life of people, regardless of their identity,\noccupation, lifestyle, economic status, social class, cultural\nbackground, and familiarity with art.\n\nBeyond attending to more items and qualities for its inquiry, everyday\naesthetics also raises theoretical issues that have not received\nadequate attention from the prevailing mainstream Western aesthetics.\nThese include: indeterminate identity of the object of aesthetic\nexperience due to a lack of an institutionally agreed-upon framing;\nchanges and modifications everyday objects go through; general\nanonymity of the designer and creator, as well as absence of any clear\nauthorship behind everyday objects; bodily engagements with objects\nand activities and their pragmatic outcome; perceived lack of criteria\nfor aesthetic judgments. By raising these issues, everyday aesthetics\nchallenges long-held assumptions underlying art-centered aesthetics\ndiscourse. However, everyday aesthetics advocates pose these\nchallenges not as a way of invalidating the established aesthetics\ndiscourse. Rather, they are meant to shed new light on the prevailing\ndiscourse. Just as new forms of art often introduce qualities and\nvalues that were not considered before and enrich the artworld, as\nsuggested by Arthur Danto, everyday aesthetics proposes to help\ndevelop the overall aesthetics discourse by adding new avenues of\ninquiry. Accordingly, the account of everyday aesthetics that follows\nwill focus on these issues that have been raised to illuminate and\nchallenge the prevailing aesthetics discourse in contemporary Western\nphilosophy.\n",
