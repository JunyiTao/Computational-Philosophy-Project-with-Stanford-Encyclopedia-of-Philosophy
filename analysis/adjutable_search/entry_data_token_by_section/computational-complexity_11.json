    "main_text": "Connections to logic and philosophy || On the significance of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)?\n4.1 On the significance of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)?\nThe appreciation of complexity theory outside of theoretical computer science is largely due to the notoriety of open questions such as 1\u20134. Of these, Open Question 1 \u2013 henceforth \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) \u2013 has attracted the greatest attention. Along with long standing unresolved questions from pure and applied mathematics such as the Riemann Hypothesis and the Hodge Conjecture, it is the subject of a major prize competition \u2013 i.e. the Millennium Problems (Cook 2006). It is also frequently the focus of survey articles and popular expositions \u2013 e.g. (Sipser 1992), (Fortnow 2009), and (Fortnow 2013).\nThere are indeed several reasons to suspect that the resolution of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) will prove to have far reaching practical and theoretical consequences outside of computer science. Perhaps the most significant of these revolves around the possibility that despite the various heuristic arguments which can currently be offered in favor of the hypothesis that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\), there remains the possibility that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) is true after all. Recall that \\(\\textbf{P}\\) can be characterized as the class of problems membership in which can be decided efficiently, whereas \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) can be characterized as the class of problems for which membership can be verified efficiently once an appropriate certificate is provided. If it turned out that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\), then the difficulty of these two tasks would coincide (up to a polynomial factor) for all problems in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\). Some consequences of this would be that the task of finding a satisfying valuation \\(v\\) for a propositional formula \\(\\phi\\) is no harder than constructing its truth table, the task of factoring a natural number would be no more difficult than verifying that a given factorization is correct, etc.\nOur intuitions strongly reflect the fact that the former problems in such pairs seem more difficult than the latter. But beyond collapsing distinctions currently appear almost self-evident, the coincidence of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) would also have a more radical effect on the situation which we currently face in mathematics. For suppose that \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is a recursively axiomatic theory which is sufficiently strong to formalize our current mathematical theorizing \u2013 e.g. Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice [\\(\\mathsf{ZFC}\\)], supplemented as needed with large cardinal hypotheses. Observe that regardless of the proof theoretic strength of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\), the following question about derivability in this theory will still presumably be decidable in polynomial time:\n\\(\\sc{PROOF}\\ \\sc{CHECKING}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\ \\) \nGiven a formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) and a finite object \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of the appropriate sort (e.g. a derivation sequence or tree), is \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) a well-formed proof of \\(\\phi\\) from the axioms of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)?[37]\nFor such standard definitions it will also be the case that for each \\(n\\), there will be of order \\(O(2^n)\\) \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)-derivations of length \\(n = \\lvert \\mathcal{D}\\rvert\\) (say measured in the number of symbols in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)). We can thus non-deterministically check if \\(\\phi\\) is derivable by a proof of size \\(\\leq n\\) by guessing a sequence of symbols length \\(n\\) and then checking (in polynomial time) whether it is a well-formed proof of \\(\\phi\\). It thus follows that the following problem is in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\):\n\\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\ \\)\nGiven a formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) and a natural number \\(n\\), does there exist a valid \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)-derivation \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of length \\(\\leq n\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a valid proof of \\(\\phi\\)?\nWe are, of course, generally interested in the question of whether \\(\\phi\\) is provable in \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) without a restriction on the length of its derivation \u2013 e.g. in the case where \\(\\phi\\) expresses the Riemann Hypothesis and \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is a theory like \\(\\textsf{ZFC}\\). But in a letter to von Neumann, G\u00f6del (1956) observed that if we were able to efficiently decide \\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\), then this would already have enormous significance for mathematical practice. For note that it seems plausible to assume that no human mathematician will ever be able to comprehend a proof containing 100 million symbols (\\(\\approx 25000\\) pages). If we were able to efficiently check if \\(\\phi \\in n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\) (say for \\(n = 10^8\\)) and obtained a negative answer, G\u00f6del concludes that \u201cthere would be no reason to think further about [\\(\\phi\\)]\u201d (1956, p. 612). For in this case a demonstration that \\(\\phi \\not\\in n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}}\\) (for a sufficiently large \\(n\\) and a sufficiently powerful \\(\\mathsf{T}\\)) would be sufficient to show that we have no hope of ever comprehending a proof of \\(\\phi\\) even if one were to exist.\nBut now note that since \\(n\\text{-}\\sc{PROVABILITY}_{\\mathsf{T}} \\in \\textbf{NP}\\), if it so happened that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) then the task of determining whether a mathematical formula is derivable in our preferred mathematical theory by a proof of feasible length would be checkable by an efficient algorithm. G\u00f6del suggests that this would have the following consequence:\n\n[D]espite the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem the mental effort of the mathematician in the case of yes-or-no questions could be completely replaced by machines.[38] (G\u00f6del 1956, 612)\n\nBuilding on this observation, several more recent commentators (e.g. Impagliazzo 1995, Arora and Barak 2009, and Fortnow 2013) have also underscored the significance of Open Question 1 by suggesting that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\) would entail the dispensability of creativity not just in mathematics, but also for a number of other tasks \u2013 e.g. theory construction or music composition \u2013 which are traditionally thought to involve elements of non-algorithmic insight.\nBut although the coincidence of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) would have intriguing consequences, it also seems likely that the discovery of a proof validating the consensus view that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) would be regarded as foundationally significant. As we have seen, the sort of evidence most often cited in favor of the proper inclusion of \\(\\textbf{P}\\) in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is the failure of protracted attempts to find polynomial time algorithms for problems in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) in which we have a strong practical interest either in deciding in practice or in proving to be intractable.[39] A proof that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) would thus not only have the effect of validating such inductive evidence, but it would provide additional evidence that the Cobham-Edmonds Thesis provides a correct analysis of the pre-theoretical notion of feasibility. In particular, it would allow us to unconditionally assert that \\(\\textbf{NP}\\)-hard problems are intractable in the general case.\nRecall, however, that such inductive considerations form only part of the overall evidence which can be cited in favor of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\). In particular, various heuristic considerations also point to the non-coincidence of the classes \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) and \\(\\textbf{coNP}\\) and of \\(\\textbf{PH}\\) and \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\), and hence to positive answers for Open Questions 2 and 3. But were it to be the case that \\(\\textbf{P} = \\textbf{NP}\\), then these questions would be resolved negatively in a manner which runs strongly counter to our current expectations (see Sections \n 3.4.1 and 3.4.2).\nGiven the convergence of several forms of non-demonstrative evidence for the conjecture that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\), it is also reasonable to ask why this statement has proven so difficult to resolve in practice. For note that although this statement originates in theoretical computer science, it may be easily formulated as statements about natural numbers. In particular, \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is equivalent to the statement that for all indices \\(e\\) and exponents \\(k\\), there exists a propositional formula \\(\\phi\\) such that the deterministic Turing machine \\(T_e\\) does not correctly decide \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s membership in \\(\\sc{SAT}\\) in \\(\\lvert \\phi\\rvert^k\\) steps. Using familiar techniques from the arithmetization of syntax, it is not difficult to see that this statement can be formalized in the language of first-order arithmetic as a \\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-statement \u2013 i.e. a statement \\(\\Theta\\) of the form \\(\\forall x \\exists y \\psi(x,y)\\) where \\(\\psi(x,y)\\) contains only bounded numerical quantifiers.\nBased on its logical form alone, we cannot currently exclude the possibility that \\(\\Theta\\) is independent not just of first-order Peano arithmetic [\\(\\mathsf{PA}\\)], but of even stronger axiom systems such as \\(\\textsf{ZFC}\\). But although early results suggested \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) may be independent of some very weak axiomatic theories (e.g. DeMillo and Lipton 1980), it is now believed that this statement is unlikely to be independent of stronger theories like \\(\\mathsf{PA}\\) which approximate the mathematical axioms we employ in practice. In particular, Ben-David and Halevi (1992) showed that if it were possible to use current proof theoretic techniques to show the independence of \\(\\Theta\\) from \\(\\textsf{PA}\\), then this demonstration itself would also show that \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) is very close to being in \\(\\textbf{P}\\) in a sense which can be made precise using techniques from circuit complexity.[40] As this is thought to be implausible, Aaronson (2003) suggests that we currently possess no reason to suspect that \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is more likely to be independent of \\(\\textsf{PA}\\) (let alone \\(\\mathsf{ZFC}\\)) than other currently open number theoretic statements.\nBut at the same time, a consensus has also developed that it is unlikely that we will be able to settle the status of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}?\\) on the basis of currently known methods of proof. A familiar example is the method of diagonalization, as employed in the proof of the undecidability of the classical Halting Problem (from which it follows that the recursive languages are properly included in the recursively enumerable ones). We have seen that a variant of this method can be used to show \\(\\textbf{P} \\subsetneq \\textbf{EXP}\\) in the proof of Theorem 3.1. But diagonalization proofs yielding such separations typically relativize to oracle-based computation in the following sense: if such a proof yields \\(\\textbf{C}_1 \\neq \\textbf{C}_2\\) for complexity classes \\(\\textbf{C}_1\\) and \\(\\textbf{C}_2\\), then a suitable modification will also typically yield \\(\\textbf{C}^A_1 \\neq \\textbf{C}^A_2\\) for all oracles \\(A \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^*\\).[41]  Baker, Gill, and Solovay (1975) famously established the existence of oracles \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(\\textbf{P}^A = \\textbf{NP}^A\\) and \\(\\textbf{P}^B \\neq \\textbf{NP}^B\\). As we would expect a proof of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) based on diagonalization to relativize to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), this suggests that it is not possible to use this method to separate \\(\\textbf{P}\\) and \\(\\textbf{NP}\\).\nDespite the negative character of this and other results which are often taken to bear on the status of \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)?, resolving this and the other open questions remains an important topic of research in theoretical computer science. Several programs for separating complexity classes have recently been explored using techniques from circuit complexity (e.g. Razborov and Rudich 1994), proof theory (e.g. Buss 1999), and algebraic geometry (e.g. Mulmuley and Sohoni 2001). However, the current consensus (e.g. Fortnow 2009) is that these approaches are still in need of substantial refinement or that genuinely new methods will be required in order to yield the desired separations.\nIt thus seems reasonable to summarize the current status of the \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\)? problem as follows: (i) \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is widely believed to be true on the basis of convergent inductive and heuristic evidence; (ii) we currently have no reason to suspect that this statement is formally independent of the mathematical theories which we accept in practice; but (iii) a proof \\(\\textbf{P} \\neq \\textbf{NP}\\) is still considered to be beyond the reach of current techniques.\n",
