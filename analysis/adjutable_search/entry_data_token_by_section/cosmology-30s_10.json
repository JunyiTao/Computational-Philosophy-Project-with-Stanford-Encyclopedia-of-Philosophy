Dingle disliked Milne\u2019s methods, but found the\ntheory itself of not much interest. Robertson initially agreed with\nDingle, but within a short time had significant changes of heart.\nEddington disliked both the theory and its philosophy, finding them\nfar too deviant from what was typical, i.e., relativistic cosmology\nand its mainstream philosophy. Younger cosmologists such as McVittie\nand McCrea, students, respectively, of Eddington and Whittaker, soon\njoined the fray. McVittie initially found the physics of kinematic\nrelativity quite interesting, and quite different from the physics of\nrelativistic cosmology (McVittie 1933b). But Milne\u2019s philosophy\nwas something else; the strict empiricism McVittie had earlier\nrevealed (McVittie 1933a) made him equally unhappy with both\nMilne\u2019s rationalism and his hypothetico-deductivism.\n\nMcCrea\u2019s remarks were among the most perceptive and favorable\n(Kermack and McCrea 1933). While he thought that Milne\u2019s\noperationalist criticisms of curved and expanding space were of little\nimport, McCrea was the first to notice the parsimony and elegance of\nMilne\u2019s strictly kinematic solution to the problem of the origin\nof the universe\u2019s expansion. Since a search for such a solution\nhad vexed relativistic cosmology for several years (McVittie 1931),\nMcCrea suggested that Milne\u2019s mechanism should be immdiately\nshown to be part of relativistic cosmology (Kermack and McCrea 1933 p.\n529).\n\nClearly, the so-recently won consensus about relativistic cosmology\nand its philosophy had dissolved into confusion and controversy over\nMilne and his methods.\n",
