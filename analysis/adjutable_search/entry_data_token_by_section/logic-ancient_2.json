    "main_text": "Aristotle\n2. Aristotle\n\n\n(For a more detailed account see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Logic\n in this encyclopedia.) Aristotle is the first great logician in the\nhistory of logic. His logic was taught by and large without rival from\nthe 4th to the 19th centuries CE.  Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical works were collected and put in a systematic order by later\nPeripatetics, who entitled them the Organon or\n\u2018tool\u2019, because they considered logic not a part but\nrather an instrument of philosophy. The Organon contains, in\ntraditional order, the Categories, De\nInterpretatione, Prior Analytics, Posterior\nAnalytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations.\nIn addition, Metaphysics \u0393 is a logical treatise that\ndiscusses the principle of non-contradiction, and some further logical\ninsights are found scattered throughout Aristotle\u2019s other works, such\nas the Poetics, Rhetoric, De Anima,\nMetaphysics \u0394 and \u0398, and some of the biological\nworks. Some parts of the Categories and Posterior\nAnalytics would today be regarded as metaphysics, epistemology or\nphilosophy of science rather than logic. The traditional arrangement\nof works in the Organon is neither chronological nor\nAristotle\u2019s own. The original chronology cannot be fully recovered\nsince Aristotle seems often to have inserted supplements into earlier\nwritings at a later time. However, by using logical advances as a \ncriterion, we can conjecture that most of the Topics,\nSophistical Refutations, Categories and\nMetaphysics \u0393 predate the De Interpretatione,\nwhich in turn predates the Prior Analytics and parts of the\nPosterior Analytics.\n",
