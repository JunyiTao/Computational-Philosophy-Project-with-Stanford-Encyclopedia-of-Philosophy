    "main_text": "Critical Theories Today || Diagnosing Crises\n4.2 Diagnosing Crises\n\nDiagnosing crises, and the social contradictions that give rise to\nthem, is a hallmark of Hegelian-Marxist critical theory. Marx famously\ndiagnosed capitalism as a crisis-ridden social system, and the early\nwork of the first generation of the Frankfurt School was a response to\nthe economic, social, and political crises of their time.\nDialectic of Enlightenment (Horkheimer and Adorno 1947) can\nbe understood as addressing the crisis of reason that was experienced\nwith the rise of National Socialism, but the critique of instrumental\nreason was disconnected from more concrete crises and struggles.\nHabermas aimed to restore the link between critique and crisis\nbeginning with his 1973 book Legitimation Crisis (Benhabib\n1986, 252\u20133, Cordero 2017, Ch. 3). Writing in the context of\nstate-managed capitalism, Habermas diagnosed the distinctively\npolitical contradictions and potential for political crises\nwithin a social system that aims to steer the economy and manage\neconomic crises (a point influentially elaborated by Offe 1984).\n\nIn subsequent decades, crisis critique, along with the critique of\ncapitalism, was largely abandoned by Frankfurt School theorists (for a\nnotable exception see Postone 1993). Renewed theoretical interest has\ncoincided with rising public concern about social, political, and\neconomic systems currently in, or always seemingly on the brink of,\ncrisis, all against the backdrop of the unfolding effects of the\nongoing climate catastrophe.\n4.2.1 Economic Crises\n\nNancy Fraser was one of the first critical theorists to revive crisis\ncritique and to do so as part of a comprehensive critique of\ncapitalism that renews the link between analytical diagnosis and\ncritique (Fraser 2011, 2014; see Wellmer 2014 for a critique of the\nFrankfurt School\u2019s earlier neglect). What distinguishes\nFraser\u2019s approach is that it posits capitalism as the unifying\ncausal link among seemingly distinct crises \u2013 in relation to\ncare work, the environment, and political institutions \u2013 by\nviewing capitalism as an institutionalized social order in which the\neconomic system \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the very conditions that\nmake it possible within the spheres of social reproduction, the\nnatural environment, and the political system (Fraser 2022). Fraser\ncombines analysis of \u201cobjective\u201d social conditions \u2013\ncontradictions and crises \u2013 with an orientation toward social\nmovements by analyzing the \u201cboundary struggles\u201d that arise\nat the seams between the economic system and other domains, making the\ncase for these struggles to unite around an anti-capitalist\nagenda.\n\nIn a similar way, Rahel Jaeggi has developed a crisis-oriented theory\nof immanent critique (2014, Ch. 6) that is not limited to diagnosing\nsystemic dysfunction but includes the normative expectations and\nself-understandings of social agents (Jaeggi 2017a; see Fraser and\nJaeggi 2018), but at a more abstract theoretical level than\nFraser\u2019s immanent analysis of capitalism as a social order. Like\nFraser and Jaeggi, Albena Azmanova argues for renewed attention to the\ncritique of capitalism but is skeptical about how helpful\n\u201ccrisis\u201d talk is (2014) and maintains that radical social\nchange is possible without crisis, revolution, or utopia through a\nunited struggle against forms of precarity that are endemic to\ncontemporary capitalism (2020). More generally, the turn to economic\ncrisis dynamics has also led to a renewed interest in work \u2013 its\ngeneral significance, pathologies, and emancipatory potential (Jaeggi\n2017b, Dejours et al. 2018, Honneth 2023).\n4.2.2 Ecological Crises\n\nTurning specifically to the ecological crisis, Frankfurt School\ntheorists have only recently begun taking seriously the task of\nrethinking their approach to critical theory in the current context of\nan ongoing ecological disaster on a global scale (for an early\nexception, see Vogel 1996). Some critical theorists argue that this\nsituation calls for a new paradigm of \u201cCritical\nNaturalism\u201d (Gregoratto et al., 2022); others argue for a\nfundamental rethinking of Western conceptions of human freedom and a\nradical shift in conceptions of the ethically good life as a\nprecondition for the kind of radical social change required by the\ncurrent crisis (Cooke 2020, 2023). Fraser focuses on the role of\ncapitalism in the climate catastrophe and the need for eco-politics to\nbe anti-capitalist so that we can reassert control over, and begin to\nreinvent from the ground up, our relation to nature (Fraser 2021,\n2022; see Bernstein 2022 for a recent approach to such\nrethinking).\n\nIn rethinking our conception of nature, given the lack of serious\nattention to theorizing about nature in the second and, until quite\nrecently, third generation of the Frankfurt School, it is not\nsurprising that many critical theorists have looked more to the first\ngeneration (see the collected essays in Biro 2011), with\nAdorno\u2019s work viewed as a promising starting point for\nrethinking humans\u2019 relation to nature (Cook 2011,\nCasseg\u00e5rd 2021, Ch. 3). Cook argues that the \u201cproject of\nshowing that human history is always also natural history and that\nnon-human nature is entwined with history\u2026 informs all\nAdorno\u2019s work\u201d and that there are important affinities\nbetween his work and proponents of radical ecology (Cook 2011, 1,\n5\u20136). On the other hand, the view of nature as having a kind of\notherness that is beyond and not fully graspable by humans \u2013 a\nview expressed at times by Adorno and Horkeimer as well as Marcuse\n\u2013 has been criticized in favor of a more Hegelian-Marxist\napproach that sees \u201cnature\u201d as a product of human activity\n(Vogel 1996, 2011). Others argue for reviving critical engagement with\nMarcuse\u2019s work as a resource for addressing the ecological\ncrisis, with its combination of a critique of science and technology\n(most radically, as a call for a \u201cnew science\u201d) with the\nidea that social transformation must include a changed, aesthetic\nrelation to nature (Feenberg 2023a, 2023b). At this point, it is clear\nthat there must be more engagement between Frankfurt School theorists\nand the many \u201ccritical ecologies\u201d being developed today,\ne.g., deep ecology, eco-feminism, eco-socialism, ecological Marxism,\nenvironmental justice, indigenous and decolonial ecologies, and new\nmaterialism (on the recent dialogue between Frankfurt School theorists\nand new materialism, see Rosa et al., 2021).\n4.2.3 Political Crises\n\nFinally, Frankfurt School theorists have turned their attention to\npolitical crises and the rise of right-wing populist, authoritarian,\nand neo-fascist movements, parties, and governments (Brown, Gordon,\nand Pensky 2018, Gordon 2017, Abromeit 2016). This crisis is\nparticularly important because adequately addressing the economic and\necological crises of our time requires political solutions, which will\nbe hindered by political systems that are themselves in crisis,\nthereby contributing to a regressive dynamic (Jaeggi 2022, Forst\n2023).\n\nFrom the perspective of critical theorists, there seem to be two\naspects of the political crisis that are often missing from mainstream\nliberal accounts. The first pertains to the genesis and the causes of\nthe crisis (Brown 2019, Gambetti 2020). Against accounts that see\nauthoritarianism only in terms of a rupture with and as entirely\nforeign to liberal democracy, they argue that we need to examine the\ncontinuities and enabling conditions that allow authoritarian\ntendencies to arise from within liberal-democratic capitalist\nsocieties. Without analyzing the neoliberal restructuring of social\nrelations and the ways in which populist and authoritarian movements\nexploit electoral strategies, fragmented public spheres, and liberal\nideological frameworks such as \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d the\ncritique of and resistance to them will necessarily remain\ntruncated.\n\nThe second aspect pertains to the dynamic of authoritarianism and the\npolitical crisis it engenders. Beyond focusing on its political\ndimension (e.g. political aims and values), critical theorists have\nsought to analyze the socio-cultural, affective, and psycho-social\ndynamics of authoritarianism and its attractiveness to populations\nthat seem to have little to gain from the election of populist leaders\n(Marasco 2018, Brown 2019, McAfee 2019, Redecker 2020, Zaretsky 2022).\nThese approaches can draw on and are supported by Adorno\u2019s\nanalysis (1967a) of core features of authoritarian right-wing\npopulism. First, it is not so much actual abandonment but a feared,\nanticipated, or imagined abandonment, along with a perceived loss of\nprivileges that had come to seem natural, that are the driving force\nof the rise of a reactionary authoritarianism that then gets\nmisdescribed as a revolt of the oppressed and exploited. Second, the\nproponents of authoritarianism, following an antisemitic and/or racist\nlogic, personalize the blame for their fears and feelings of\nabandonment by projecting it onto groups they classify as alien,\nrather than attributing it to structural features of society.\n\nIn responding to all the crises discussed here \u2013 economic,\necological, and political \u2013 critical theorists must grapple with\na number of challenges. Purely at the level of theory, there is the\nquestion of whether positing unity or convergence among crises is\ndiagnostically accurate. At a practical level, it remains to be seen\nwhether a unity thesis will be politically motivating and whether a\nconvergence of social struggles is indeed on the horizon. The issue of\npractice also bears on the question of whether and to what extent the\nobjective conditions of crisis and contradiction diagnosed by critical\ntheorists actually affect people\u2019s everyday lived experience and\nbecome motivating factors for political movements (see\n Section 2.5).\n Such questions about the relation between theory and practice have\nlong been a focus of critical theorists and have recently gained\nattention in theorizing about a range of critical and political\npractices.\n4.3 Critical Practices\n\nWhile overcoming the gap between theory and practice has been a\ncentral methodological and political concern for critical theorists,\ncritics have pointed out the prominent turn away from practice to\ntheory in the first generation \u2013 accused by Luk\u00e1cs of\ntaking up residence in the \u201cGrand Hotel Abyss\u201d\n(Luk\u00e1cs 1963, 22) \u2013 and the continued marginalization of\ncritical praxis in later generations (Harcourt 2020). There are\nmultiple grounds for challenging this assessment. Frankfurt School\ntheorists had arguments all along about how to assess and relate to\nradical movements, such as the student movement of 1968 (Adorno and\nMarcuse 1969, Freyenhagen 2014, Pickford 2023), and there has always\nbeen a strand that continuously engaged with struggles and movements,\nfrom Marcuse to Negt and Kluge and Fraser. Some critical theorists\nhave focused on deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and civil\nsociety (Habermas 1962, 1992, 2021, Cohen and Arato 1992, Benhabib\n2004, Lafont 2019) as core fora for critical practice, while others\nhave argued for critical theory itself to be democratized and\nunderstood as a critical practice (Bohman 2003, Celikates 2009).\n\nStill, many of these approaches have been criticized for prioritizing\ninstitutional achievements over struggles and critical practices, and\nreform over revolution. Given the challenges outlined above (4.2), it\nis not surprising that some recent work tries to reverse this tendency\nby exploring more radical responses to such crises. These attempts\nnotably push beyond the dichotomy between reform and revolution\n\u2013 for example, by promoting non-reformist reforms that could\n\u201calter the terrain on which future struggles will be waged, thus\nexpanding the set of feasible options for future reforms\u201d\n(Fraser, in Fraser and Honneth 2003, 79) \u2013 and mine the rich\nhistory and present of radical struggles outside traditional forms of\npolitical organizing such as the party or reimagine the party in\nradical ways (Dean 2016).\n\nThe range of critical practices engaged with by critical theorists\npast and present is extensive (for an inventory, see Harcourt 2020,\nCh. 15). Frankfurt School theorists of earlier generations covered\nvarious forms of resistance, from the \u201cGreat Refusal\u201d of\nthe 1960s (Marcuse) and the potential for resistance in independent\nthinking and critical analysis in the face of universal reification\n(Adorno) to civil disobedience as a sign of a dynamic public sphere\nand civil society (Habermas 1983b, Cohen and Arato 1992, Ch. 11). More\nrecently, critical theorists within various traditions have analyzed\nforms of disobedience (direct, digital, migrant etc.) as political\npractices of contestation and struggles for democratization\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (Young 2001, Smith 2013, Scheuerman 2018,\nCelikates 2019b). Other practices of resistance that do not directly\nengage with state institutions or appeal to the broader public include\nforms of sabotage (Malm 2020), fleeing, withdrawal, or defection.\nThese turn away from what are seen as state-oriented struggles for\nvisibility, recognition, or representation (Virno 2004, Roberts 2015)\nand towards subaltern forms of sociality (Moten and Harney 2013) and\ncounter-communities that prefigure fundamental alternatives for living\ntogether (Loick 2021). Emphasizing the revolutionary dimension of\ncritical practices, theorists have drawn on the abolitionist tradition\nof struggles against slavery and colonialism, and its revitalization\nin movements like Black Lives Matter, to call for a fundamental\ncritique of racial capitalism and its entanglement with the punitive\nstate, and a correspondingly radical transformation of all social\nrelations and institutions (Davis 2005, Gilmore 2022). Critical\ntheorists have also explored political practices of assembling (Butler\n2015), occupying, striking, and reorganizing processes of social\nreproduction (Gago 2019), linking these to the need to rethink\nrevolution beyond the model of a single break or event and more as an\ninterstitial process (Redecker 2018, Saar 2020).\n\nWhether the new revolutionary subjects and struggles that emerge in\nthese critical practices will indeed converge to fundamentally\nchallenge the existing order, open up new pathways to emancipation,\nand develop emancipated \u2013 more just, democratic, and sustainable\n\u2013 modes of living together remains to be seen.\nHorkheimer\u2019s quip still holds: \u201cif the proof of the\npudding is in the eating, the eating here is still in the\nfuture\u201d (1937a [1972, 220\u20131]). Against this background,\ntheoretical explorations of critical practices \u2013 in the\nmultiplicity of their forms, terrains, and actors \u2013 can be seen\nas part of the ongoing attempt to bring theory and practice together\nwith an emancipatory orientation in light of the crises and struggles\nof the age. This approach has characterized the Frankfurt School from\nits very beginnings and has been a driving force in its continual\n(self-)transformation, making it into one of the most influential\nparadigms in social philosophy today.",
