    "main_text": "The Infinite (apeiron)\n12. The Infinite (apeiron)\n\n\nAristotle famously rejects the infinite in mathematics and in\nphysics, with some notable exceptions. He defines it thus:\nThe infinite is that for which it is always possible to\ntake something outside.\n\n\nImplicit in this notion is an unending series of magnitudes, which will\nbe achieved either by dividing a magnitude (the infinite by division)\nor by adding a magnitude to it (the infinite by addition). This is why\nhe conceives of the infinite as pertaining to material explanation, as\nit is indeterminate and involves potential cutting or joining (cf.\nSection 7.5). \n\n\nAristotle argues that in the case of magnitudes, an infinitely large\nmagnitude and an infinitely small magnitude cannot exist. In fact, he\nthinks that universe is finite in size. He also agrees with Anaxagoras,\nthat given any magnitude, it is possible to take a smaller. Hence, he\nallows that there are infinite magnitudes in a different sense. Since\nit is always possible to divide a magnitude, the series of division is\nunending and so is infinite. This is a potential, but never actual\ninfinite. For each division potentially exists. Similarly, since it is\nalways possible to add to a finite magnitude that is smaller than the\nwhole universe continually smaller magnitudes, there is a potential\ninfinite in addition. That series too need never end. For example, if I\nadd to some magnitude a foot board, and then less than a half a foot,\nand then less than a fourth, and so forth, the total amount added will never\nexceed two feet. Aristotle claims that the mathematician never needs\nany other notion of the infinite.\n\n\nHowever, since Aristotle believes that the universe has no beginning\nand is eternal, it follows that in the past there have been an infinite\nnumber of days. Hence, his rejection of the actual infinite in the case\nof magnitude does not seem to extend to the concept of time.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle on the Infinite\n13. Aristotle and the Evidence for the History of Mathematics\n\n\nAs philosophers usually do, Aristotle cites simple or familiar examples\nfrom contemporary mathematics, although we should keep in mind that\neven basic geometry such as we find in Euclid's Elements would\nhave been advanced studies. The average education in mathematics would\nhave been basic arithmetical operations (possibly called\nlogistik\u00ea) and metrological geometry (given certain\ndimensions of a figure, to find other dimensions), such as were also\ntaught in Egypt. Aristotle does allude to this sort of mathematics on\noccasion, but most of his examples come from the sort of mathematics\nwhich we have come to associate with Greece, the constructing of\nfigures from given figures and rules, and the proving that figures have\ncertain properties, and the \u2018discovery\u2019 of numbers with\ncertain properties or proving that certain classes of numbers have\ncertain properties. If we attend carefully to his examples, we can even\nsee an emerging picture of elementary geometry as taught in the\nAcademy. In the supplement are provided twenty-five of his favorite\npropositions (the list is not exhaustive). \n\n\nAristotle also makes some mathematical claims that are genuinely\nproblematic. Was he ignorant of contemporary work? Why does he ignore\nsome of the great problems of his time? Is there any reason why\nAristotle should be expected, for example to refer to conic sections?\nNonetheless, Aristotle does engage in some original and difficult\nmathematics. Certainly, in this Aristotle was more an active\nmathematician than his mentor, Plato.\n\n\nFor more information, see the following supplementary document:\nAristotle and Greek Mathematics\nGlossary\n\n\nThe standard English translation is given first, and, where\nappropirate, other more idiomatic translations.
