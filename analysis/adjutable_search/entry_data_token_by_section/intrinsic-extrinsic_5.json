    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality || Local vs. Non-Local Properties\n2.2 Local vs. Non-Local Properties\n\nWe now turn to the notion of intrinsicality characterised by the\ncharacterisations listed in section\n 1.\n Or perhaps better, we now turn to the notions of\nintrinsicality characterised by these characterisations, since, while\nLewis thought that each of these characterisations characterise a\nsingle notion of intrinsically, it is plausible that they characterise\ndifferent notions. In this subsection, we will discuss the notion\ncharacterised by the first characterisation which involves aboutness.\nIn the next two subsections, we will discuss the notions characterised\nby the other two characterisations.\n\nLewis\u2019s first characterisation is:\n\nA sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic\nproperties to something is entirely about that thing; whereas an\nascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about\nthat thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which\nincludes that thing as part. (Lewis 1983a: 111\u20132)\n\n\nThe notion of aboutness employed in this characterisation is plausibly\nthat of intrinsic aboutness, where intrinsic aboutness can be\nintuitively characterised by (1).\n\n(1)\n A state of affairs\n\\(s\\) is intrinsically about a thing \\(x\\) iff \\(s\\) (either truly or\nfalsely) describes how \\(x\\) and its parts are and how they are\nrelated to each other, as opposed to how \\(x\\) and its parts are\nrelated to other things and how other things are. \n\n\nUsing the notion of intrinsic aboutness, Lewis\u2019s first\ncharacterisation can be more precisely stated by the schema (2).\n\n(2)\nThe property of being \\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for\nany \\(x\\), the state of affairs of \\(x\\) being \\(F\\) is intrinsically\nabout \\(x\\).\n\n\nFor any predicate \\(F\\) expressing a property \\(p\\), and any name\n\\(n\\) referring to an \\(x\\), define the ascription of \\(p\\) to \\(x\\)\nto be the state of affairs expressed by \\(\\ulcorner Fn\\urcorner\\).\nUsing this definition, we can replace the schema (2) with the sentence\n(3).\n\n(3)\n For any property\n\\(p, p\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), the ascription\nof \\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\).\n\n\n(3) plausibly classifies being a cube as intrinsic, since,\nfor any \\(x\\), the state of affairs of \\(x\\) being a cube plausibly\ndescribes how \\(x\\) and its parts are and how they are related to each\nother, as opposed to how they are related to other things and how\nother things are. In contrast, (3) plausibly classifies being an\nuncle as non-intrinsic, since its ascription to a thing is not\nonly about how it and its parts are and how they are related to each\nother, but also about how it is related to things outside of it. (3)\nalso plausibly classifies being Obama as non-intrinsic since the\nascription of being Obama to Clinton, namely the state of affairs of\nObama being identical to Clinton, is not wholly about Clinton, but is\nalso about Obama. Finally, (3) also appears to classify being such\nthat there is a number as non-intrinsic, even if it is necessary that\nthere are numbers. This is because the ascription of this property to\nClinton, namely the state of affairs that Clinton is such that there\nis a number, appears to be not wholly about how Clinton is, but is\nalso about how things wholly distinct from Clinton are. (We will\nassume that the intuition underlying this judgement is correct.\nHowever, this is not uncontroversial. See Sider 1996 for a rejection\nof a closely related intuition and Eddon 2011 for a reply to this\nrejection.)\n\nIn the following, we will call the properties classified as intrinsic\nby (3) local properties, and call the properties classified\nby (3) as not intrinsic non-local properties. (This notion of\na local property needs to be distinguished from the local conception\nof something having a property in an intrinsic fashion discussed in\nsection\n 1.2.)\n",
