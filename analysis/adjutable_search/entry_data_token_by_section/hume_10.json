    "main_text": "Causation || Belief\n5.3 Belief\n\nCausal inference leads us not only to conceive of the effect,\nbut also to expect it. When I expect that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache, I\u2019m not just abstractly considering the\nidea of headache relief, I believe that aspirin will relieve\nit. What more is involved in believing that aspirin will\nrelieve my headache than in merely conceiving that it\nwill?\n\nIt can\u2019t be that beliefs have some additional idea\u2014the\nidea of belief, perhaps\u2014that conceptions lack. If there were\nsome such idea, given our ability to freely combine ideas, we could,\nby simply willing, add that idea to any conception whatsoever, and\nbelieve anything we like.\n\nHume concludes that belief must be some sentiment or feeling aroused\nin us independently of our wills, which accompanies those ideas that\nconstitute them. It is a particular way or manner of conceiving an\nidea that is generated by the circumstances in which we find\nourselves.\n\nIf constant conjunctions were all that is involved, my thoughts about\naspirin and headaches would only be hypothetical. For belief, one of\nthe conjoined objects must be present to my senses or memories; I must\nbe taking, or just have taken, an aspirin. In these circumstances,\nbelieving that my headache will soon be relieved is as unavoidable as\nfeeling affection for a close friend, or anger when someone harms us.\n\u201cAll these operations are species of natural instincts, which no\nreasoning \u2026 is able either to produce or prevent\u201d (EHU\n5.1.8/46\u201347).\n\nWhile Hume thinks that defining this sentiment may be\nimpossible, we can describe belief, if only by analogy,\nalthough he was never completely satisfied with his attempts to do so.\nBelief is a livelier, firmer, more vivid, steady, and intense\nconception of an object. Hume intends these characterizations to go\nbeyond merely recording intensity of feeling to capture how belief\n\n\nrenders realities \u2026 more present to us than fictions, causes\nthem to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence\non the passions and imagination. (EHU 5.2.12/49)\n\n\nBut how does an idea come to be conceived in such a manner that it\nconstitutes a belief?\n\nHume\u2019s explanation is that as I become accustomed to\naspirin\u2019s relieving my headaches, I develop a propensity\u2014a\ntendency\u2014to expect headache relief to follow taking aspirin. The\npropensity is due to the associative bond that my repeated experiences\nof taking aspirin and headache relief have formed. My present\nimpressions of taking an aspirin are as forceful and vivid as anything\ncould be, and some of their force and vivacity transfers across the\nassociative path to the idea of headache relief, enlivening it with\nenough force and vivacity to give it the \u201cstrength and\nsolidity\u201d that constitutes belief.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know how aspirin relieves headaches, it is\nfortunate that there is \u201ca kind of pre-established harmony\nbetween the course of nature and the succession of our ideas\u201d\nthat teaches me to take aspirin when I have a headache. Custom, Hume\nmaintains, in language that anticipates and influenced Darwin,\n\n\nis that principle by which this correspondence has been effected; so\nnecessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our\nconduct, in every circumstance of human life. (EHU 5.2.21/55)\n\n\nIt is far better, Hume concludes, to rely on \u201cthe ordinary\nwisdom of nature\u201d, which ensures that we form beliefs \u201cby\nsome instinct or mechanical tendency\u201d, rather than trusting it\nto \u201cthe fallacious deductions of our reason\u201d (EHU\n5.2.22/55).\n\nIn keeping with his project of providing a naturalistic account of how\nour minds work, Hume has given empirical explanations of our\npropensity to make causal inferences, and the way those inferences\nlead to belief.\n",
