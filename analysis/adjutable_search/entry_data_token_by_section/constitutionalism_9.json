    "main_text": "The Moral Reading\n10. The Moral Reading\n\nAmong the most influential critics of originalism was Ronald Dworkin,\nfor whom historical factors like original meanings and intentions,\nthough often important, are in no way dispositive in constitutional\nrights cases. They in no way fix the limits of government power until\nsuch time as an amendment passes or the constitution is abandoned or\nreplaced. On the contrary, constitutions set the terms of an ongoing\ndebate about the moral principles and values it enshrines. And as the\npolitical community\u2019s understanding of these principles\ndevelops, the very content of the constitution develops and improves\nalong with it. The framers\u2019 contribution to this process is that\nthey enacted some \u2018general principles\u2019 which future\ninterpreters must constructively interpret (Dworkin 1996, 8\u20139; see\nrelatedly Greenberg and Littman 1998). This arguably renders\nDworkin\u2019s constitutional theory a version of living\nconstitutionalism.\n\nA crucial element in Dworkin\u2019s constitutional theory is his\ngeneral claim that the law of a community, including its\nconstitutional law, includes more than any explicit text or decisions\nauthoritatively adopted or made in accordance with accepted\nprocedures. It does, of course, include many such elements and these\ncan be found, paradigmatically, in statute books, judicial decisions\nand, of course, written constitutions. These are often termed\n\u2018positive law.\u2019 But the positive law in no way exhausts\nthe law according to Dworkin. Most importantly, for our purposes here,\nit in no way exhausts that part of the law referred to as \u2018the\nconstitution\u2019. In Dworkin\u2019s view, a constitution includes\nthe principles of political morality that provide the best explanation\nand moral justification \u2013 i.e., the best interpretation \u2013 of\nwhatever limits have been expressed in positive law, including the\nconstitution and any decisions taken in application of it. Hence,\nconstitutional interpretation must always invoke a theory of political\nmorality. One concerned to interpret the limits on government power\nand authority imposed by a constitution must construct an interpretive\ntheory that provides the written constitution, and the many decisions\ntaken under it, with their best explanation and moral\njustification.\n\nThere are, for our purposes here, three important implications of\nDworkin\u2019s theory of constitutional interpretation. First,\noriginal intentions and understandings at best set the stage for the\nongoing debates of political morality that constitutional rights cases\nboth require and license. They seldom, if every settle matters.\nSecond, constitutional rights cases require the kind of\ndecision-making which is, according to originalism, properly\nundertaken only by those with the authority to fix the limits on\ngovernment power contained within a constitution \u2013 i.e., its authors\nor framers. The kind of morally and politically uncontroversial\njudicial decision-making, within a stable framework established by\nother responsible agents, to which originalism aspires, is simply\nimpossible on Dworkin\u2019s theory. Dworkin\u2019s theory, like (or\nas a form of) living constitutionalism, requires wholesale rejection\nof the fixed view. The constitution is not a finished product, handed\ndown in a form fixed till such time as its amending formula is\ninvoked, or the constitution abandoned or replaced. Rather, it is a\nwork in progress requiring continual revisiting and reworking as our\nmoral and political theories concerning its limits are refined and, it\nis hoped, improved. It is, in short, a living thing.\n\nA third, related implication of Dworkin\u2019s theory, is that judges\nin constitutional cases do not simply implement decisions made by\nothers \u2013 the constitution\u2019s authors or framers. On the\ncontrary, they are partners with the authors in an ongoing political\nproject, one that requires participants, then and now, to engage in\nthe kind of moral and political decision-making which, on the fixed\nview, settled matters when the constitution was first adopted (or\namended). The limits to government power are, on Dworkin\u2019s\ntheory, continually and essentially contestable. Interpreting the\ncontestable terms of a constitution is an ongoing task, requiring that\neach and every interpreter provide her own best, and undoubtedly\nimperfect, interpretation of the limits placed on government by her\nconstitution and the various official decisions taken under it. The\nlatter can never be fixed.\n",
