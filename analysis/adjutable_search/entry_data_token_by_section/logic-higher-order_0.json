    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nSecond-order\n logic[1]\n was introduced by Frege in his Begriffsschrift (1879) who also coined\nthe term \u201csecond order\u201d (\u201czweiter\nOrdnung\u201d) in (1884: \u00a753). It was widely used in logic\nuntil the 1930s, when set theory started to take over as a foundation\nof mathematics. It is difficult to say exactly why this happened, but\nset theory has certain simplicity in being based on one single binary\npredicate \\(x\\in y\\), compared to second- and higher-order logics,\nincluding type theory. Discussion among philosophers of the merits of\nsecond-order logic especially in comparison to set theory continues to\nthis day (Shapiro 1991). Meanwhile second-order logic has become a\nstandard tool of computer science logic, finite model theory in\nparticular. Central questions of theoretical computer science, such as\nthe P = NP? question, can be seen as questions about second-order\nlogic in the finite context.\n\nUltimately second-order logic is just another formal language. It can\nbe given the standard treatment making syntax, semantics and proof\ntheory exact by working in a mathematical metatheory which we choose\nto be set theory. It would be possible to use second-order logic\nitself as metatheory, but it would be more complicated, simply because\nsecond-order logic is less developed than set theory.\n\nThe distinction between first order logic and second-order logic is\neasiest to understand in elementary mathematics. Let us consider\nnumber theory. The objects of our study are the natural numbers 0, 1,\n2,\u2026 and their arithmetic. With first order logic we can\nformulate statements about number theory by using atomic expressions\n\\(x = y,\\) \\(x+y = z\\) and \\(x\\times y = z\\) combined with the\npropositional operations \\(\\land,\\) \\(\\neg,\\) \\(\\lor,\\) \\(\\to\\) and\nthe quantifiers \\(\\forall x\\) and \\(\\exists x\\). Here the variables\nx, y, z,\u2026 are thought to range over the\nnatural numbers. With second-order logic we can express more: we have\nvariables x, y, z,\u2026 as in first order\nlogic for numbers. In addition we have variables X, Y,\nZ,\u2026 for properties of numbers and relations between\nnumbers as well as quantifiers \\(\\forall X\\) and \\(\\exists X\\) for\nthese variables. We have the atomic expressions of first order logic\nand also new atomic expressions of the form \\(X(y_1,\\ldots,\ny_n)\\).\n\nAn interesting and much studied question arises: what properties of\nnatural numbers can be expressed in first order logic and what can be\nexpressed in second-order logic? The question is equally interesting\nif \u201cexpressed\u201d is replaced by \u201cproved\u201d, once a\nsuitable proof system is given in both cases. We can replace natural\nnumbers by some other mathematical context, for example real numbers,\ncomplex numbers, and so on.\n\nWith just the constant \\(0\\) and the unary function \\(n \\mapsto n^+\\)\n(where \\(n^+\\) means \\(n+1\\)) we can express in second-order logic the\nInduction Axiom  \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\\label{ind} \\forall X\\left(\\left[X(0) \\land \\forall\ny\\left(X(y) \\to X(y^+)\\right)\\right] \\to \\forall y\\,X(y)\\right), \\]\n\n\nof natural numbers. This, together with the axioms \\(\\forall\nx\\,\\neg(x^+=0)\\) and \\(\\forall x\\,\\forall y(x^+=y^+\\to x=y)\\)\ncharacterizes the natural numbers with their successor operation up to\nisomorphism. In first order logic any theory which has a countably\ninfinite model has also an uncountable model (by the Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence (\\ref{ind}) cannot be expressed\nin first order logic. Another typical second-order expression is the\nCompleteness Axiom of the linear order \\(\\le\\) of the real\nnumbers:  \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\\label{comp} \\forall X\\left(\\left[\\exists y\\,X(y) \\land\n\\exists z\\,\\forall y(X(y) \\to y \\le z)\\right] \\to\\\\ \\exists z\\,\\forall\ny\\left(\\exists u\\left(X(u) \\land y \\le u\\right) \\lor z \\le\ny\\right)\\right), \\]\n\n\nThis, together with the axioms of ordered fields characterizes the\nordered field of real numbers up to isomorphism. In first order logic\nany countable theory which has an infinite model has also a countable\nmodel (by the Downward L\u00f6wenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence\n(\\ref{comp}) cannot be expressed in first order logic.\n\nTo early logicians it seemed natural to use second-order logic on a\npar with first order logic, as if there were not much difference. This\nincluded Russell, L\u00f6wenheim, Hilbert, and Zermelo. Essentially\nonly Skolem emphasized the difference (see Moore 1988 for the\nemergence of first order logic). In 1929 G\u00f6del proved his\nCompleteness Theorem and the next year his Incompleteness Theorem. It\nbecame gradually obvious that second-order logic is very different\nfrom first order logic. One of the first indicators was the\nincompleteness phenomenon. G\u00f6del showed that any effective\naxiomatization of number theory is incomplete. On the other hand,\nthere was a simple finite categorical\u2014hence complete\n (\u00a710)\u2014axiomatization\n of the structure \\((\\oN,\\) \\(+,\\) \\(\\times)\\) in second-order logic\n(see also the discussion related to (\\ref{ind})). This showed that\nthere cannot be such a complete axiomatization of second-order logic\nas there was for first order logic. What became known in the case of\nfirst order logic as G\u00f6del\u2019s Completeness Theorem simply\ncannot hold for second-order logic.\n\nThe situation changed somewhat when Henkin proved the Completeness\nTheorem for second-order logic with respect to so-called general\nmodels\n (\u00a79).\n Now it became possible to use second-order logic in the same way as\nfirst order logic, if only one keeps in mind that the semantics is\nbased on general models. The ability of second-order logic to\ncharacterize mathematical structures up to isomorphism does not extend\nto general models (except in the form of internal\ncategoricity\u2014see\n \u00a710).\n Any second-order theory with an infinite general model has general\nmodels of all infinite cardinalities, and therefore cannot be\ncategorical in the context of general models. We shall discuss general\nmodels and the related Henkin models in\n \u00a79.\n",
