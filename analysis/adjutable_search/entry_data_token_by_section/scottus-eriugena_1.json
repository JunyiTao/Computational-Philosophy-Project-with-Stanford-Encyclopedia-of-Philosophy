    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Theological Controversy over Predestination\n1.2 Theological Controversy over Predestination\n\nEriugena first came to historical notice when he was commissioned by\ntwo French bishops\u2014Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims and Bishop\nPardulus of Laon\u2014to refute a treatise by a Saxon monk,\nGottschalk (806\u201368), a priest of Orbais in the diocese of\nSoissons, who interpreted St. Augustine as teaching a\n\u201ctwofold\u201d or \u201ctwin predestination\u201d (gemina\npraedestinatio) of the elect to heaven and of the damned to hell,\nbased on the opinion of St. Isidore, Sententiae II, 6, I (PL\n83: 606a). Gottschalk had already been condemned by a synod at Mainz\nin 848 and another at Quierzy in 849 and had been imprisoned in the\nabbey of Hautvillers (where he remained until his death in 868), but\nPrudentius, the bishop of Troyes, appeared to side with him. Hincmar\nwas worried that Gottschalk\u2019s side was attracting powerful\nsupporters and he engaged Eriugena to write a strong rebuttal.\nEriugena\u2019s response, De divina praedestinatione (On\nDivine Predestination, c. 851, see Madec edition, 1978), a\ntreatise of nineteen chapters, which survives in a single manuscript,\nis a robust rebuttal of Gottschalk. Eriugena rejects any divine\npredestination to evil by an appeal to God\u2019s unity,\ntranscendence, and goodness. While purporting merely to interpret\nAugustinian texts, this early theological treatise is philosophically\nsignificant for its rationalistic, dialectical analysis of key\ntheological concepts and its reliance on argument rather than\nscriptural citation. In this treatise, Eriugena, citing\nAugustine\u2019s De uera religione 5.8, PL 34: 126, claims\n\u201cthat true philosophy is true religion and conversely that true\nreligion is true philosophy\u201d. As one gloss in the\nAnnotationes in Marcianum attests: \u201cno one enters\nheaven except through philosophy\u201d (nemo intrat in celum nisi\nper philosophiam, Annotationes 57.15, AM: 64). Eriugena\nthen argues that philosophy has four principal parts\u2014division,\ndefinition, demonstration, and resolution\u2014and the pursuit of\nthis fourfold method of reasoning will lead to truth. This focus on\ndialectic as the path to truth is a constant theme of Eriugena\u2019s\nphilosophy, one recognized by his contemporaries.\n\nEriugena argues in De divina praedestinatione that God, being\nperfectly good, wants all humans to be saved, and does not predestine\nsouls to damnation. God\u2019s being is His willing and \u201cno\nnecessity binds the will of God\u201d. On the contrary, humans damn\nthemselves through their own free choices: \u201cSin, death,\nunhappiness are not from God\u201d. Since God is outside time, He\ncannot be said to fore-know or to pre-destine, terms\nthat involve temporal predicates. Furthermore, if God\u2019s being is\nHis wisdom, God can be said to have but a single knowledge and hence a\n\u201cdouble\u201d predestination cannot be ascribed to Him. Human\nnature, on the other hand, was created rational, and rationality\nrequires freedom. Human nature is therefore essentially free:\n\u201cFor God did not create in man a captive will but a free one,\nand that freedom remained after sin\u201d\n(De divina praedestinatione, 4.6).\n\n\nIn the course of his diatribe against the \u201cravings\u201d of\nGottschalk, Eriugena locates his opponent\u2019s heresy as midway\nbetween the heresy of Pelagius, which rejects the power of grace, and\nthe opposing heresy, which denies the possibility of human freedom.\nIronically, Eriugena himself would in turn be accused of\n\u201cOrigenism\u201d and \u201cPelagianism\u201d by\nGottschalk\u2019s advocate, Bishop Prudentius of Troyes (see the\nlatter\u2019s De Praedestinatione, PL 115: 1010c), due to\nhis perceived emphasis on human free-will in the salvific process.\nPrudentius, an erstwhile admirer of Scottus, published an opposing\ntreatise, which, while acknowledging his \u201cIrish eloquence\u201d\n(Celtica eloquentia, PL 115: 1194a), dismisses\nEriugena\u2019s reasoning as confused and not based on sound\nknowledge of scripture. Florus too attacked Eriugena. Subsequently,\nOn Divine Predestination was condemned by the bishops in\nFrance at the councils of Valence (855) and Langres (859), in part for\nits over-use of logical method or dialectic (dialectica). The\nphrase \u201cIrish porridge\u201d (pultes scottorum),\nrecalling Jerome\u2019s sneer against Pelagius, is used in these\nofficial denunciations.\n",
