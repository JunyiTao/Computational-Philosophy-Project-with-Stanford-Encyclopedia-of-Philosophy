    "main_text": "Do optimality models describe evolution?\n4. Do optimality models describe evolution?\n\n\n Claims and counterclaims about the use of\noptimality models for understanding evolution are a central part of the\ndebate over adaptationism, although some believe that there is no\nnecessary connection between optimality modeling and adaptationism\n(Potochnik 2009). While many biologists believe that optimality\nmodels are useful, whether evolution by natural selection tends to\nproduce optimal traits is controversial (see, e.g., Dupr\u00e9\n1987).\n\n\n Optimality models put the contingencies of\nhistory and developmental and genetic constraints in to the background\nso as to focus on natural selection. Much work in evolutionary\ngame theory embodies this approach. Most game-theoretic models are used\nto describe the evolution by natural selection of strategic behavior to\na local optimum called an evolutionarily stable strategy (Maynard Smith\n1982) (but see Orzack and Hines 2005 and Huttegger 2010 among\nothers). This approach has the assumption that there is direct\nselection on the trait under analysis. This is often justified on the\ngrounds that there exists a \u201cgood fit\u201d between the trait\nand its current function (Maynard Smith 1978) or that natural selection\nis ubiquitous in nature (Mayr 1983). The Spandrels paper targeted\nthese general arguments for optimality models.\n\n\n Biologists have discovered many ways in\nwhich the genetic details of trait determination and/or ecological\ndetails of the population can prevent the evolution of optima. For\nexample, interaction between loci (linkage or pleiotropy) can prevent\nthe optimal phenotype from being fixed in a population, and thereby\nprevent the maximization of mean fitness (Moran 1964). Such a deviation\nfrom the state of highest fitness is called genetic load. The standard\nadaptationist response is that genetic and ecological constraints are\neliminated over evolutionary time by the introduction of new genetic\nvariation via mutation (Parker and Maynard Smith 1990).\n\n\n While this controversy has been divisive\n(Schwartz 2002), there are prospects for a synthesis. First,\nEshel and Feldman (2001) distinguished between \u201cshort-term\nevolution\u201d, the evolutionary dynamics of a fixed set of\ngenotypes, and \u201clong-term evolution\u201d, bouts of short-term\nevolution interspersed with introductions of new genetic\nvariation. They noted (page 162) that \u201clong-term evolution\nproceeds by an infinite sequence of transitions from one fixed set of\ngenotypes to another fixed set of genotypes, with each of these sets\nsubject to short-term evolution\u2026\u201d Optima are often\nnot accessible in the short-term due to constraints on available\nvariation. However, genetic variation may be introduced over the long\nterm so that the population eventually reaches an optimum. The\nsubstantive point is that we now understand how apparent short-term\nimpediments to optimality can be resolved over the long term. Mutations\nmust appear at the right time and the ecology must remain stable over\nthe long term; whether these conditions are met frequently enough in\nnature to justify the optimality approach is an empirical issue (see\nalso Hammerstein 1996). The second prospect for synthesis is\nWilkins and Godfrey Smith's (2009) proposal that the truth of\nempirical adaptationism, and the concomitant application of optimality\nmodels, depends on the intended \u201cgrain\u201d of resolution of\nthe evolutionary analysis. At a fine grain of resolution, when there\nare few peaks in the adaptive landscape, most observed populations may\nbe on or near these peaks. Adaptationism is appropriate at this\nresolution. If we \u201czoom out\u201d and look at a grand landscape\nover large regions of morphospace, the situation changes. At a\nvery coarse grain of resolution, much of morphospace is empty and\nconstraints often explain why certain regions remain unexplored by\nbiological evolution. Adaptationism is inappropriate at this\nresolution.\n\n\n Finally, the focus on optimality modeling\nin connection to adaptationism has led to a precise statement of how\nthe nature of fit between data and the predictions of an optimality\nmodel influence the degree of evidentiary support for the adaptive\nhypothesis (Orzack and Sober 1994a, b). Qualitative agreement by\nitself is not sufficient to accept the hypothesis of local optimality.\nInstead, quantitative agreement and an assessment of nature of possible\nbetween-individual heterogeneity of fit to model predictions are\nrequired in order to have evidence for optimality; without both of\nthese test components, acceptance of the hypothesis of optimality is\nnot warranted (see above).\n",
