    "main_text": "Gamification\n6. Gamification\n\nThe main topic of this entry is a logical approach to game theory,\nbringing classical notions and methods from logic to bear upon games.\nThis project is sometimes called \u2018logic of games\u2019. There\nalso is a converse direction of \u2018logic as games\u2019, where\ngame theoretic concepts are employed to elucidate basic notions of\nlogic. This section presents a brief discussion on this direction as a\nnatural counterpoint to the main lines of the entry. For an extensive\nsurvey see the entries on\n logic and games\n and\n games, abstraction and completeness.\n\n",
