As Heidegger puts it:\n\n\neverything with which humanity is endowed must, in the [poetic]\nprojection [that \u201cbrings-into-being\u201d or makes things newly\nintelligible], be drawn up from out of the closed ground [i.e., from\nthe \u201cearth\u201d understood as the untapped possibilities still\nconcealed within the tradition] and set upon this ground.\n(PLT 75\u20136/GA5 63)\n\n\nHumanity\u2019s ontological \u201cendowment\u201d (our sense of\nwhat entities are) comes from the poetic\n\u201cnaming-into-being\u201d (or making intelligible) at the heart\nof art. Moreover, Heidegger adds (showing that he was indeed a\nconservative revolutionary, in 1936 at least), Western humanity\u2019s\nsense of being can only be changed historically through the creative\ndiscovery of possibilities hidden within the tradition that has come\ndown to us. Only by discovering the tradition\u2019s hidden\nheritage can we hope to reshape our communal sense of what is and what\nmatters, thereby redrawing the basic contours of this tradition and so\ncreating new possibilities for human understanding and action. In\nthis way, for Heidegger, art remains capable of redrawing the lines\nthat establish our basic sense of what-is and what matters.\n\n\nFor art to accomplish this revolutionary task, however, the artist\nmust be able to see something beginning to take shape where others see\nnothing at all. All great creators must be able to discern the\ninchoate contours of something previously unseen and, as if thus\nplaying midwife to being, help draw it into the light of the\nworld.\n\n\nBecause it is such a drawing, all creation is a drawing-up (like\ndrawing water from a well). Modern subjectivism, of course,\nmisinterprets creation as the product of the genius of the\nself-sovereign subject [and so imagines that a genius creates ex\nnihilo, by simply projecting his or her subjectivity onto an\notherwise meaningless world]. \u2026The poeticizing projection comes\nout of nothing in the sense that it never derives its gift from what is\nfamiliar and already there. But in another sense it does not come\nout of nothing; for what it projects is only the withheld determination\nof historical existence [Dasein] itself. (PLT 76/GA5\n63\u20134)\n\n\nAs this suggests, at the very core of Heidegger\u2019s\nunderstanding of art is an encounter with a \u201cnothing\u201d that\nis not simply nothing at all but, rather, designates possible meanings\nstill concealed within the tradition, which preserves historical\nintelligibility as it has come down to us. The inchoate contours\nof that which is not yet a thing need to be drawn out in an original\nway in order to release the possibilities inherent in the tradition and\nso create or renew humanity\u2019s ontological inheritance for the\nfuture. In other words, artistic creation requires the exercise\nof an active receptivity we might call ontological\nresponse-ability, that is, an ability to respond to the\ninchoate ways in which being offers itself to intelligibility.\nFor, only such an ability will prove capable (in Heidegger\u2019s\nterms) of bringing that which was hidden in the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d\n(or still slumbering in the \u201cearth\u201d) into the light of our\nhistorical worlds.\n\n\nTo participate in such creation, the artist needs to be receptive to\nwhat \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d calls the\n\u201crift-design\u201d or \u201cfissure\u201d (Ri\u00df)\nthat joins the world to the earth. By \u201ccreatively\u201d\nand selectively responding to the abundance of ways in which being\ngenuinely offers itself to us, the artist establishes one of these\npossibilities, bringing it into the light of day for the first time,\njust as Michelangelo legendarily spent weeks carefully studying the\nsubtle network of veins and fissures running through that famous piece\nof marble before he could set his \u201cDavid\u201d free from the\nstone. This is not to say that David was the only possible form\nslumbering in that particular piece of marble; the rifts and fissures\nrunning through it might have been taken up by the artist and\ncreatively gestalted in other ways, thereby giving birth to other, more\nor less different\n sculptures.[78]\nIn any such case, however, \u201cthe\nestablishing of truth in the work is the bringing forth of a being such\nas never was before and will never come to be again\u201d (PLT 62/GA5\n50). In artistic creation, the artist responds to what offers itself,\ncreatively discerning and helping to realize the outlines of a new\nworld in the manifold possibilities offered up by the\n earth.[79]\n As Heidegger puts it:\n\n\nThere certainly lies hidden in nature a rift-design, a measure and\nborder, and, tied to it, a capacity for bringing-forth\u2014that is,\nart. But it is equally certain that this art hidden in nature\nbecomes manifest only through the work, because it is lodged\noriginarily in the work. (PLT 70/GA5 58)\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, then, all great artists learn to\nrecognize and respond to the complex texture of edges, lines, and\nbreaks which together constitute an open-ended \u201cbasic\ndesign\u201d or \u201coutline sketch\u201d (PLT 63/GA5 51), which\nthe artist then creatively gestalts in order to bring at least one of\nthe \u201cinexhaustible\u201d shapes still hidden in the earth into\nthe light of the world.\n\n\nTo gestalt the hints nature offers us in one way is necessarily not\nto gestalt them in another, but Heidegger thinks that Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting of the shoes preserves the hints of other possible gestalts in\nits quietly dynamic tension between what clearly takes shape in the\nforeground and what recedes into the background. For, in Van\nGogh\u2019s painting, what recedes into the phenomenological\nbackground does so in such a way that, rather than completely\ndisappearing behind the foreground image, it continues to manifest a\ncomplex texture of rifts and fissures that suggest the possibility of\nother gestalts, new ways of drawing out what simultaneously offers\nitself to and withdraws from our grasp, even ones that challenge the\nhabitual ways in which we have come to see things (as an ordinary pair\nof shoes, for example). As Heidegger thus puts it, a truly great\nartistic \u201cbeginning\u2026always contains the undisclosed\nabundance of the unfamiliar and extraordinary, which means that it\nalso contains the strife with the familiar and the ordinary\u201d (PLT\n76/GA5 64).\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s view that the hints intelligibility offers us can\nbe gestalted in more than one way makes him an ontological\npluralist (or plural realist), but he does not\nbelieve that just anything goes. As his thoughts on the\n\u201crift-structure\u201d permeating intelligibility suggest,\nHeidegger firmly believes that there is a coming into being in nature\nitself which the bringing into being through art should serve.\nThis means that there must be limits on what the artist can creatively\nimpose that arise from the matter itself. The\n\u201cabundant\u201d dimension of intelligibility Heidegger calls\n\u201cearth\u201d has to genuinely resist the artist\u2019s creative\nefforts to bring it into the light of the world at some point (or\npoints), or else art would just be a frictionless subjective projection\nor hallucination (or even a deeper ontological destructiveness\nmasquerading as creativity), rather than an ontologically-maieutic\ngestalting that finds a genuinely creative way to be grounded in and\ntruly responsive to the ways things show themselves. The\nimportance of acknowledging that there is always something in\nintelligibility that resists our merely subjective designs (and not\nCarnap\u2019s famous critique) seems to be the main reason Heidegger\nstopped talking about the \u201cnothing\u201d and began referring to\nthe \u201cearth.\u201d All genuine creativity, all\nbringing-into-being, must learn to recognize and respect (what we could\nthink of as) the texture of the text with which it works. This\nmean that all artists\u2014indeed, all those who would\nbring-into-being in a meaningful way, whatever media they work\nwith\u2014must learn to draw creatively upon an elusive and excessive dimension of being\nthat cannot be entirely appropriated, finally mastered, or\ndefinitively manipulated.[80]\n\n\nHeidegger thus implicitly contrasts two drastically different ways\nof comporting ourselves toward that which shows itself to\nus\u2014namely, the active receptivity of a genuinely\n\u201cpost-modern\u201d responsiveness to the phenomenological\n\u201cabundance\u201d of being, on the one hand, and, on the other,\nthe endless domination of modern subjectivism (which treats everything\nas an object to be mastered) or, even worse, the obtuse reductiveness\nof late-modern enframing (which understands and so relates to\neverything as an intrinsically-meaningless resource to be\noptimized). Perhaps the easiest way to understand the difference\nbetween the poetic and technological modes of revealing Heidegger\ncontrasts is to think in terms of the ancient Greek distinction between\npoiesis and techn\u00ea. Simply think, first,\nof a poetic midwifery that respects and seeks to draw out the natural\npotentialities of the matters with which it works, as Michelangelo\nlegendarily freed his \u201cDavid\u201d from the\nmarble or, less hyperbolically put, as a skillful woodworker notices\nthe inherent qualities of particular pieces of wood (attending to\nsubtleties of shape and grain, shades of color, weight, and hardness),\nwhile deciding what (or even whether) to build from that wood. In\nthe same way, Heidegger contends, \u201c[t]he authentic interpretation\nmust show what does not stand there in the words and yet is said\nnevertheless\u201d (IM 173/GA40 171). For Heidegger, as this\nsuggests, an \u201cauthentic\u201d hermeneutics must work creatively\nto bring forth the hidden riches of a text in the same way that a true\nwoodworker learns to \u201canswer and respond above all to the\ndifferent kinds of wood and to the shapes slumbering within\nwood\u2014to wood as it enters into human dwelling with all the hidden\nriches of its nature\u201d (WCT 14/GA8 17).  Our creative yet responsive disclosure of such hermeneutic possibilities is what Heidegger calls \u201cpreservation,\u201d because it works to keep the world opened by the work alive historically as a way of seeing and understanding.\n\n\nThe distinctive character of this post-modern responsiveness to the\nabundance of being stands out most clearly when we contrast it with our\ndefining late-modern tendency toward the kind of technological making\nwhich imposes form on matter without paying any heed to its intrinsic\npotentialities, in the way that, for example, an industrial factory\nindiscriminately grinds wood into woodchips in order to paste them back\ntogether into straight particle board which can then be used flexibly\nto efficiently construct a maximal variety of useful\n objects.[81]\nTo\nemphasize the difference, Heidegger pointedly asks: \u201cBut where in\nthe manipulations of the industrial worker is there any relatedness to\nsuch things as the shapes slumbering within wood?\u201d (WCT 23/GA8\n26) Insofar as such a relatedness cannot be found, something\ncrucial has gone\n missing.[82]\nFor, without such an ontological\nresponsiveness, human beings lose touch with what Heidegger understands\nas the source of meaning. Although our late-modern metaphysics\nleads us to assume that all meaning comes from us, as the result of our\nsubjective \u201cvalue positings,\u201d Heidegger is committed to the\nless subjectivistic and more phenomenologically accurate view that, at\nleast with respect to that which most matters to us (the paradigm case\nbeing love), what we care about most is not entirely up to us,\nnot simply within our power to control, and that this is a crucial part\nof what makes it so\n important.[83]\n\n\nTo learn from art how to understand the being of entities in a\npost-modern way means learning to cultivate and develop the ontological\nresponsiveness that allows us to understand and experience entities as\nbeing richer in meaning than we are capable of doing justice to\nconceptually, rather than taking them as intrinsically meaningless\nresources awaiting optimization. In this way, we can learn to\napproach the humble things that make up our worlds with care, humility,\npatience, gratitude, even\n awe.[84]\nThis subjectivism-humbling lesson in\nontological responsiveness is precisely what Heidegger thinks great art\nlike Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d can\nhelp teach\n us.[85]\nIn the contemporaneous \u201cH\u00f6lderlin and the\nEssence of Poetry\u201d (1936), Heidegger argues that the German\nRomantic poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin is the \u201cpoet of\npoetry\u201d because H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry expresses\npoetically what poetry is: H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry\nnames-into-being the fact that poetry itself is essentially\na\n naming-into-being.[86]\nIn the same way, \u201cThe Origin of\nthe Work of Art\u201d presents Van Gogh as the painter of\npainting. For Heidegger, Van Gogh is the painter who paints what\npainting really is, because his painting captures and\npreserves that essential tension between revealing and concealing,\n\u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld,\u201d which is at work in all\nart, indeed, in all creation, all bringing into and\nmaintaining in intelligibility.\n\n\nWhat drew Heidegger to Van Gogh, then, was not just their mutual\naffinity for rural life, their shared awareness of the way its pastoral\nrhythms are rooted in nature\u2019s cycles and bespeak a fundamental\nfaith that hard work can bring forth the earth\u2019s hidden\nbounty. Heidegger seems to have been deeply moved by the way\nhalf-formed figures seem to struggle to take shape in the background of\nVan Gogh\u2019s paintings, less in clear lines than in the thick\ntexture of the paint, brush strokes, and deep fields of color.\n(This is something that, unfortunately, even the most realistic\nrepresentations of his paintings fail fully to convey, which is why\nthere is no substitute for encountering Van Gogh\u2019s paintings in\nperson.) For Heidegger, these two sources of attraction work\ntogether; it is the mysterious bounty of the strife between world and\nearth that comes through in the tension between what shows itself in\nthe foreground and what recedes into the background of Van Gogh\u2019s\npaintings. In Heidegger\u2019s interpretation, Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting preserves the essential strife whereby the \u201cnothing\nnoths,\u201d both calling for and partly eluding conceptualization,\nand his painting thereby allows us to encounter the way the earth both\nyields to and resists our worlds and so, out \u201cof the calm of\ngreat riches, ripens and dispenses what is inexhaustible\u201d (IM\n164/GA40 118).\n",
