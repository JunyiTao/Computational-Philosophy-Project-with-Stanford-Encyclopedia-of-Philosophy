    "main_text": "Ontology and Categories\n5. Ontology and Categories\n\nIn keeping with his views on knowledge and language, Crathorn\nadvocated radical changes to traditional Aristotelian ontology. These\nare discussed in a sub-treatise on the categories in his\nCommentary on the Sentences (I Sent. qq.\n13\u201318).\n\nOckham famously reduced the ten Aristotelian categories to two,\nsubstance and quality, treating the other eight as modes of signifying\nsubstances and qualities. For Crathorn, however, the entire\nAristotelian system has to be revised. The human mind naturally knows\nnothing but qualities, and we cannot be certain that even they exist\nwithout appealing to the principle that God could not deceive us.\nThinking and reasoning are of no help because, as we saw above, they\nare purely conventional.\n\nInstead, Crathorn treats the Aristotelian categories as philosophical\nconventions. Following the chapters of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories step by step, he comes to the conclusion that none\nof the ten categories are valid because the reasons Aristotle uses to\ndistinguish them are inadequate. For example, the category of\nsubstance is distinguished from the other categories by the fact that\nit has no contrary and can successively acquire contrary qualities\n(Aristotle, Categories 5). But Crathorn claims that when we\nheat a piece of wood or a man, not only the substance but also its\nqualities become hot, such that its qualities change from one state to\ntheir contrary exactly like a substance. Therefore, this crucial\ndistinction between substance and accidents does not apply. Crathorn\nwrites, \u201cnot only the substance of the wood can receive the\ncontraries, but also the accidents of the wood ... but if the wood is\nhot, not only is the heat attached to the wood hot, but also all the\npositive coextensive natures of the wood\u201d (I Sent., q.\n13, concl. 13). He also affirms that \u201cone and the same thing\nnumerically can truly be said to be substance and accident in relation\nto different things\u201d (ibid., concl. 5). Indeed, water\nand fire can be considered as natural substances, but one is the\ncontrary of the other. As a general conclusion, Crathorn asserts that\nthe very same thing can be called a substance, a quality, a quantity,\na relation and so forth (q. 17, p. 462 and q. 18, p. 476).\n\nCrathorn develops his position mostly by attacking the views of other\nphilosophers who accepted such distinctions, but unfortunately he is\nnot always clear about his positive reasons for abandoning\nAristotelian ontology. But, on one hand it is consistent with his\nepistemology, for our only direct and natural certitude is that\nqualities exist. On the other hand, it is also consistent with his\nfrequent tendency to materialism. Indeed, we can discern hints of\natomism in his Commentary on the Sentences.\n",
