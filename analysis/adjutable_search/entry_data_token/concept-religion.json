In short,\nthe concept is today used for a genus of social formations that\nincludes several members, a type of which there are many tokens.\n\nThe concept religion did not originally refer to a social\ngenus, however. Its earliest references were not to social kinds and,\nover time, the extension of the concept has evolved in different\ndirections, to the point that it threatens incoherence. As Paul\nGriffiths notes, listening to the discussions about the concept\nreligion\n\n\nrapidly suggests the conclusion that hardly anyone has any idea what\nthey are talking about\u2014or, perhaps more accurately, that there\nare so many different ideas in play about what religion is that\nconversations in which the term figures significantly make the\ndifficulties in communication at the Tower of Babel seem minor and\neasily dealt with. These difficulties are apparent, too, in the\nacademic study of religion, and they go far toward an explanation of\nwhy the discipline has no coherent or widely shared understanding of\nits central topic. (2000: 30)\n\n\nThis entry therefore provides a brief history of the how the semantic\nrange of religion has grown and shifted over the years, and\nthen considers two philosophical issues that arise for the contested\nconcept, issues that are likely to arise for other abstract concepts\nused to sort cultural types (such as \u201cliterature\u201d,\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d, or \u201cculture\u201d itself). First, the\ndisparate variety of practices now said to fall within this category\nraises a question of whether one can understand this social taxon in\nterms of necessary and sufficient properties or whether instead one\nshould instead treat it as a family resemblance concept. Here, the\nquestion is whether the concept religion can be said to have\nan essence. Second, the recognition that the concept has shifted its\nmeanings, that it arose at a particular time and place but was unknown\nelsewhere, and that it has so often been used to denigrate certain\ncultures, raises the question whether the concept corresponds to any\nkind of entity in the world at all or whether, instead, it is simply a\nrhetorical device that should be retired. This entry therefore\nconsiders the rise of critical and skeptical analyses of the concept,\nincluding those that argue that the term refers to nothing.\n", "toc": [{"#HistConc": "1.

A History of the Concept\n\nThe concept religion did not originally refer to a social\ngenus or cultural type. It was adapted from the Latin term\nreligio, a term roughly equivalent to\n\u201cscrupulousness\u201d. Religio also approximates\n\u201cconscientiousness\u201d, \u201cdevotedness\u201d, or\n\u201cfelt obligation\u201d, since religio was an effect of\ntaboos, promises, curses, or transgressions, even when these were\nunrelated to the gods. In western antiquity, and likely in many or\nmost cultures, there was a recognition that some people worshipped\ndifferent gods with commitments that were incompatible with each other\nand that these people constituted social groups that could be rivals.\nIn that context, one sometimes sees the use of nobis religio\nto mean \u201cour way of worship\u201d. Nevertheless,\nreligio had a range of senses and so Augustine could consider\nbut\u00a0reject it as the right abstract term for \u201chow one\nworships God\u201d because the Latin term (like the Latin terms for\n\u201ccult\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d) was used for the\nobservance of duties in both one\u2019s divine and one\u2019s human\nrelationships (Augustine City of God [1968: Book X, Chapter\n1, 251\u2013253]). In the Middle Ages, as Christians developed\nmonastic orders in which one took vows to live under a specific rule,\nthey called such an order\u00a0religio (and\nreligiones for the plural), though the term continued to be\nused, as it had been in antiquity, in adjective form to describe those\nwho were devout and in noun form to refer to worship (Biller 1985:\n358; Nongbri 2013: ch. 2).\n\nThe most significant shift in the history of the concept is when\npeople began to use religion as a genus of which Christian\nand non-Christian groups were species. One sees a clear example of\nthis use in the writings of Edward Herbert (1583\u20131648).\u00a0As\nthe post-Reformation Christian community fractured into literal\nwarring camps, Herbert sought to remind the different protesting\ngroups of what they nevertheless had in common. Herbert identified\nfive \u201carticles\u201d or \u201celements\u201d that he proposed\nwere found in every religion, which he called the Common Notions,\nnamely: the beliefs that\n\nthere is a supreme\n deity,[2]\nthis deity should be worshipped,\nthe most important part of religious practice is the cultivation\nof virtue,\none should seek repentance for wrong-doing, and\none is rewarded or punished in this life and the next.\n\n\nIgnoring rituals and group membership, this proposal takes an\nidealized Protestant monotheism as the model of religion as such.\nHerbert was aware of peoples who worshipped something other than a\nsingle supreme deity. He noted that ancient Egyptians, for instance,\nworshipped multiple gods and people in other cultures worshipped\ncelestial bodies or forces in nature. Herbert might have argued that,\nlacking a belief in a supreme deity, these practices were not\nreligions at all but belonged instead in some other category such as\nsuperstition, heresy, or magic. But Herbert did include them, arguing\nthat they were religions because the multiple gods were actually\nservants to or even aspects of the one supreme deity, and those who\nworshiped natural forces worshipped the supreme deity \u201cin His\nworks\u201d.\n\nThe concept religion understood as a social genus was\nincreasingly put to use by\u00a0to European Christians as they sought\nto categorize the variety of cultures they encountered as their\nempires moved into the Americas, South Asia, East Asia, Africa, and\nOceania. In this context, fed by reports from missionaries and\ncolonial administrators, the extension of the generic concept was\nexpanded. The most influential example is that of anthropologist\nEdward Burnett Tylor (1832\u20131917) who had a scholarly interest in\npre-Columbian Mexico. Like Herbert, Tylor sought to identify the\ncommon denominator of all religions, what Tylor called a\n\u201cminimal definition\u201d of religion, and he proposed that the\nkey characteristic was \u201cbelief in spiritual beings\u201d (1871\n[1970: 8]). This generic definition included the forms of life\npredicated on belief in a supreme deity that Herbert had classified as\nreligion. But it could also now include\u2014without Herbert\u2019s\nprocrustean assumption that these practices were really directed to\none supreme being\u2014the practices used by Hindus, ancient\nAthenians, and the Navajo to connect to the gods they revere, the\npractices used by Mahayana Buddhists to connect to Bodhisattvas, and\nthe practices used by Malagasy people to connect to the cult of the\ndead. The use of a unifying concept for such diverse practices is\ndeliberate on Tylor\u2019s part as he sought to undermine assumptions\nthat human cultures poorly understood in Christian\nEurope\u2014especially those despised ones, \u201cpainted black on\nthe missionary maps\u201d (1871 [1970: 4])\u2014were not on the very\nsame spectrum as the religion of his readers. This opposition to\ndividing European and non-European cultures into separate categories\nunderlies Tylor\u2019s insistence that all human beings are\nequivalent in terms of their intelligence. He argued that so-called\n\u201cprimitive\u201d peoples generate their religious ideas when\nthey wrestle with the same questions that all people do, such as the\nbiological question of what explains life, and they do so with the\nsame cognitive capacities. They may lack microscopes or telescopes,\nbut Tylor claims that they seek to answer these questions in ways that\nare \u201crational\u201d, \u201cconsistent\u201d, and\n\u201clogical\u201d. Tylor repeatedly calls the Americans, Africans,\nand Asians he studies \u201cthinking men\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophers\u201d. Tylor was conscious that the definition he\nproposed was part of a shift: though it was still common to describe\nsome people as so primitive that they had no religion, Tylor complains\nthat those who speak this way are guilty of \u201cthe use of wide\nwords in narrow senses\u201d because they are only willing to\ndescribe as religion practices that resemble their own expectations\n(1871 [1970: 3\u20134]).\n\nIn the twentieth century, one sees a third and last growth spurt in\nthe extension of the concept. Here the concept religion is\nenlarged to include not only practices that connect people to one or\nmore spirits, but also practices that connect people to\n\u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cforces\u201d that lack minds, wills,\nand personalities. One sees this shift in the work of William James,\nfor example, when he writes,\n\n\nWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest\nand most general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the\nbelief that there is an unseen order, and our supreme good lies in\nharmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. (1902 [1985: 51]; cf.\nProudfoot 2000)\n\n\nBy an \u201cunseen order\u201d, James presumably means a structure\nthat is non-empirical, though he is not clear about why the term would\nnot also include political, economic, or other invisible but\nhuman-created orders. The same problem plagues James\u2019s\ndescription of \u201ca MORE\u201d operating in the universe that is\nsimilar to but outside oneself (1902 [1985: 400], capitalization in\nthe original). The anthropologist Clifford Geertz addresses this\nissue, also defining religion in terms of an\n\u201corder\u201d but specifying that he means practices tied to\nconceptions of \u201ca general order of existence\u201d,\nthat is, as he also says, something whose existence is\n\u201cfundamental\u201d, \u201call-pervading\u201d, or\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d (1973: 98, emphasis added). The practices\nthat are distinctly religious for Geertz are those tied to a\nculture\u2019s metaphysics or worldview, their conception of\n\u201cthe overall shape of reality\u201d (1973: 104). Like James,\nthen, Geertz would include as religions not only the forms of life\nbased on the theistic and polytheistic (or, more broadly, animist or\nspiritualist) beliefs that Herbert and Tylor recognized, but also\nthose based on belief in the involuntary, spontaneous, or\n\u201cnatural\u201d operations of the law of karma, the Dao in\nDaoism, the Principle in Neo-Confucianism, and the Logos in Stoicism.\nThis expansion also includes Theravada Buddhism because dependent\nco-origination (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) is a conception\nof the general order of existence and it includes Zen Buddhism because\nBuddha-nature is said to pervade everything. This third expansion is\nwhy non-theistic forms of Buddhism, excluded by the Herbert\u2019s\nand Tylor\u2019s definitions but today widely considered religions,\ncan serve as \u201ca litmus test\u201d for definitions of the\nconcept (Turner 2011: xxiii; cf. Southwold 1978). In sum, then, one\ncan think of the growth of the social genus version of the concept\nreligion as analogous to three concentric circles\u2014from\na theistic to a polytheistic and then to a cosmic (or\n\u201ccosmographic\u201d [Dubuisson 1998]) criterion. Given the\nnear-automatic way that Buddhism is taken as a religion today, the\ncosmic version now seems to be the dominant one.\n\nSome scholars resist this third expansion of the concept and retain a\nTylorean definition, and it is true that there is a marked difference\nbetween practices that do and practices that do not involve\ninteracting with person-like beings. In the former, anthropomorphic\ncases, practitioners can ask for help, make offerings, and pray with\nan understanding that they are heard. In the latter,\nnon-anthropomorphic cases, practitioners instead typically engage in\nactions that put themselves \u201cin accord with\u201d the order of\nthings. The anthropologist Robert Marett marks this difference between\nthe last two extensions of the concept religion by\ndistinguishing between \u201canimism\u201d and\n\u201canimatism\u201d (1909), the philosopher John Hick by\ndistinguishing between religious \u201cpersonae\u201d and religious\n\u201cimpersonae\u201d (1989: ch. 14\u201315). This difference\nraises a philosophical question: on what grounds can one place the\npractices based on these two kinds of realities in the same category?\nThe many loa spirits, the creator Allah, and the\nall-pervading Dao are not available to the methods of the natural\nsciences, and so they are often called \u201csupernatural\u201d. If\nthat term works, then religions in all three concentric circles can be\nunderstood as sets of practices predicated on belief in the\nsupernatural. However, \u201csupernatural\u201d suggests a two-level\nview of reality that separates the empirically available natural world\nfrom some other realm metaphorically \u201cabove\u201d or\n\u201cbehind\u201d it. Many cultures lack or reject a distinction\nbetween natural and supernatural (Saler 1977, 2021). They believe that\ndisembodied persons or powers are not in some otherworldly realm but\nrather on the top of a certain mountain, in the depths of the forest,\nor \u201ceverywhere\u201d. To avoid the assumption of a two-level\nview of reality, then, some scholars have replaced supernatural with\nother terms, such as \u201csuperhuman\u201d. Hick uses the term\n\u201ctranscendent\u201d:\n\n\nthe putative reality which transcends everything other than itself but\nis not transcended by anything other than itself. (1993: 164)\n\n\nIn order to include loa, Allah, and the Dao but to exclude\nnations and economies, Kevin Schilbrack (2013) proposes the neologism\n\u201csuperempirical\u201d to refer to non-empirical things that are\nalso not the product of any empirical thing. Wouter Hanegraaff (1995),\nfollowing J. G. Platvoet (1982: 30) uses \u201cmeta-empirical\u201d.\nWhether a common element can be identified that will coherently ground\na substantive definition of \u201creligion\u201d is not a settled\nquestion.\n\nDespite this murkiness, all three of these versions are\n\u201csubstantive\u201d definitions of religion because\nthey determine membership in the category in terms of the presence of\na belief in a distinctive kind of reality. In the twentieth century,\nhowever, one sees the emergence of an importantly different approach:\na definition that drops the substantive element and instead defines\nthe concept religion in terms of a distinctive role that a\nform of life can play in one\u2019s life\u2014that is, a\n\u201cfunctional\u201d definition. One sees a functional approach in\nEmile Durkheim (1912), who defines religion as whatever\nsystem of practices unite a number of people into a single moral\ncommunity (whether or not those practices involve belief in any\nunusual realities). Durkheim\u2019s definition turns on the social\nfunction of creating solidarity. One also sees a functional approach\nin Paul Tillich (1957), who defines religion as whatever\ndominant concern serves to organize a person\u2019s values (whether\nor not that concern involve belief in any unusual realities).\nTillich\u2019s definition turns on the axiological function of\nproviding orientation for a person\u2019s life.\n\nSubstantive and functional approaches can produce non-overlapping\nextensions for the concept. Famously, a functional approach can hold\nthat even atheistic forms of capitalism, nationalism, and Marxism\nfunction as religions. The literature on these secular institutions as\nfunctionally religions is massive. As Trevor Ling says,\n\n\nthe bulk of literature supporting the view that Marxism is a religion\nis so great that it cannot easily be set aside. (1980: 152)\n\n\nOn capitalism as a religion, see, e.g., McCarraher (2019); on\nnationalism, see, e.g., Omer and Springs (2013: ch. 2). One\nfunctionalist might count white supremacy as a religion (Weed 2019;\nFinley et al. 2020) and another might count anti-racism as a religion\n(McWhorter 2021). Here, celebrities can reach a religious status and\nfandom can be one\u2019s religious identity (e.g., Lofton 2011;\nLovric 2020). Without a supernatural, transcendent, or superempirical\nelement, these phenomena would not count as religious for Herbert,\nTylor, James, or Geertz. Conversely, interactions with supernatural\nbeings may be categorized on a functional approach as something other\nthan religion. For example, the Thai villager who wears an apotropaic\namulet and avoids the forest because of a belief that malevolent\nspirits live there, or the ancient Roman citizen who takes a bird to\nbe sacrificed in a temple before she goes on a journey are for\nDurkheim examples of magic rather than religion, and for Tillich\nquotidian rather than ultimate concerns.\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that to define religion as a social\ngenus is to treat it as something universal, as something that appears\nin every human culture. It is true that some scholars have treated\nreligion as pan-human. For example, when a scholar defines\nreligion functionally as the beliefs and practices that\ngenerate social cohesion or as the ones that provide orientation in\nlife, then religion names an inevitable feature of the human\ncondition. The universality of religion that one then finds is not a\ndiscovery but a product of one\u2019s definition. However, a social\ngenus can be both present in more than one culture without being\npresent in all of them, and so one can define religion,\neither substantively or functionally, in ways that are not universal.\nAs common as beliefs in disembodied spirits or cosmological orders\nhave been in human history, for instance, there were people in the\npast and there are people in the present who have no views of an\nafterlife, supernatural beings, or explicit metaphysics.\n2. Two Kinds of Analysis of the Concept\n\nThe history of the concept religion above shows how its\nsenses have shifted over time. A concept used for scrupulous devotion\nwas retooled to refer to a particular type of social practice. But the\nquestion\u2014what type?\u2014is now convoluted. The cosmic version\nof the concept is broader than the polytheistic version, which is in\nturn broader than the theistic version, and the functional definitions\nshift the sense of the term into a completely different register. What\nis counted as religion by one definition is often not counted by\nothers. How might this disarray be understood? Does the concept have a\nstructure? This section distinguishes between two kinds of answer to\nthese questions. Most of the attempts to analyze the term have been\n\u201cmonothetic\u201d in that they operate with the classical view\nthat every instance that is accurately described by a concept will\nshare a defining property that puts them in that category. The last\nseveral decades, however, have seen the emergence of\n\u201cpolythetic\u201d approaches that abandon the classical view\nand treat religion, instead, as having a prototype structure.\nFor incisive explanations of the classical theory and the prototype\ntheory of concepts, see Laurence and Margolis (1999).\n2.1 Monothetic approaches\n\nMonothetic approaches use a single property (or a single set\nof properties) as the criterion that determines whether a concept\napplies. The key to a monothetic approach is that it proposes\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the given class.\nThat is, a monothetic approach claims that there is some\ncharacteristic, or set of them, found in every religion and that if a\nform of life has it, then that form of life is a religion. Most\ndefinitions of the concept religion have been of this type.\nFor example, as we saw above, Edward Tylor proposes belief in\nspiritual beings as his minimal definition of religion, and this\nis a substantive criterion that distinguishes religion from\nnon-religion in terms of belief in this particular kind of entity.\nSimilarly, Paul Tillich proposes ultimate concern as a\nfunctional criterion that distinguishes religion from non-religion in\nterms of what serves this particular role in one\u2019s life. These\nare single criterion monothetic definitions.\n\nThere are also monothetic definitions that define religion in terms of\na single set of criteria. Herbert\u2019s five Common Notions are an\nearly example. More recently, Clifford Geertz (1973: ch. 4) proposes a\ndefinition that he breaks down into five elements:\n\na system of symbols\nabout the nature of things,\nthat inculcate dispositions for behavior\nthrough ritual and cultural\n performance,[3]\nso that the conceptions held by the group are taken as real.\n\n\nOne can find each of these five elements separately, of course: not\nall symbols are religious symbols; historians (but not novelists)\ntypically consider their conceptions factual; and so on. For Geertz,\nhowever, any religious form of life will have all five. Aware of\nfunctional approaches like that of Tillich, Geertz is explicit that\nsymbols and rituals that lack reference to a metaphysical\nframework\u2014that is, those without the substantive element he\nrequires as his (2)\u2014would be secular and not religious, no\nmatter how intense or important one\u2019s feelings about them are\n(1973: 98). Reference to a metaphysical entity or power is what marks\nthe other four elements as religious. Without it, Geertz writes,\n\u201cthe empirical differentia of religious activity or religious\nexperience would not exist\u201d (1973: 98). As a third example,\nBruce Lincoln (2006: ch. 1) enumerates four elements that a religion\nwould have, namely:\n\n\u201ca discourse whose concerns transcend the human, temporal,\nand contingent, and that claims for itself a similarly transcendent\nstatus\u201d,\npractices connected to that discourse,\npeople who construct their identity with reference to that\ndiscourse and those practices, and\ninstitutional structures to manage those people.\n\n\nThis definition is monothetic since, for Lincoln, religions always\nhave these four features \u201cat a minimum\u201d (2006:\n 5).[4]\n To be sure, people constantly engage in practices that generate\nsocial groups that then have to be maintained and managed by rules or\nauthorities. However, when the practices, communities, and\ninstitutions lack the distinctive kind of discourse that claims\ntranscendent status for itself, they would not count for Lincoln as\nreligions.\n\nIt is worth noting that when a monothetic definition includes multiple\ncriteria, one does not have to choose between the substantive and\nfunctional strategies for defining religion, but can instead\ninclude both. If a monothetic definition include both strategies,\nthen, to count as a religion, a form of life would have to refer to a\ndistinctive substantive reality and also play a certain role in the\nparticipants\u2019 lives. This double-sided approach avoids the\nresult of purely substantive definitions that might count as religion\na feckless set of beliefs (for instance, \u201csomething must have\ncreated the world\u201d) unconnected from the believers\u2019\ndesires and behavior, while also avoiding the result of purely\nfunctional definitions that might count as religion some universal\naspect of human existence (for instance, creating collective\neffervescence or ranking of one\u2019s values). William James\u2019s\ndefinition of religion (\u201cthe belief that there is an unseen\norder, and our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves\nthereto\u201d) is double-sided in this way, combining a belief in the\nexistence of a distinctive referent with the spiritual disciplines\nwith which one seeks to embody that belief. Geertz\u2019s definition\nof religion also required both substantive and functional aspects,\nwhich he labelled \u201cworldview\u201d and \u201cethos\u201d\n(1973: ch. 5). To treat religion as \u201cboth/and\u201d in this way\nis to refuse to abstract one aspect of a complex social reality but\ninstead recognizes, as Geertz puts it, both \u201cthe dispositional\nand conceptual aspects of religious life\u201d (1973:\n 113).[5]\n\nThese \u201cmonothetic-set definitions\u201d treat the concept of\nreligion as referring to a multifaceted or multidimensional complex.\nIt may seem avant garde today to see religion described as a\n\u201cconstellation\u201d, \u201cassemblage\u201d,\n\u201cnetwork\u201d, or \u201csystem\u201d, but in fact to treat\nreligion as a complex is not new. Christian theologians traditionally\nanalyzed the anatomy of their way of life as simultaneously\nfides, fiducia, and fidelitas. Each of\nthese terms might be translated into English as \u201cfaith\u201d,\nbut each actually corresponds to a different dimension of a social\npractice. Fides refers to a cognitive state, one in which a\nperson assents to a certain proposition and takes it as true. It could\nbe translated as \u201cbelief\u201d or \u201cintellectual\ncommitment\u201d. Beliefs or intellectual commitments distinctive to\nparticipation in the group will be present whether or not a religious\nform of life has developed any authoritative doctrines. In contrast,\nfiducia refers to an affective state in which a person is\nmoved by a feeling or experience that is so positive that it bonds the\nrecipient to its source. It could be translated as \u201ctrust\u201d\nor \u201cemotional commitment\u201d. Trust or emotional commitment\nwill be present whether or not a religious form of life teaches that\nparticipation in their practices aims at some particular experience of\nliberation, enlightenment, or salvation. And fidelitas refers\nto a conative state in which a person commits themselves to a path of\naction, a path that typically involves emulating certain role models\nand inculcating the dispositions that the group considers virtuous. It\ncould be translated as \u201cloyalty\u201d or\n\u201csubmission\u201d. Loyalty or submission will be present\nwhether or not a religious form of life is theistic or teaches moral\nrules. By the time of Martin Luther, Christian catechisms organized\nthese aspects of religious life in terms of the \u201cthree\nC\u2019s\u201d: the creed one believed, the cult or worship one\noffered, and the code one followed. When Tillich (1957: ch. 2) argues\nthat religious faith is distorted when one treats it not as a complex\nbut instead as a function of the intellect alone, emotion alone, or\nthe will alone, he is speaking from within this tradition. These three\ndimensions of religious practices\u2014symbolically, the head, the\nheart, and the hand\u2014are not necessarily Christian. In fact,\nuntil one adds a delimiting criterion like those discussed above,\nthese dimensions are not even distinctively religious. Creed, cult,\nand code correspond to any pursuit of what a people considers true,\nbeautiful, and good, respectively, and they will be found in any\ncollective movement or cultural tradition. As Melford Spiro says, any\nhuman institution will involve a belief system, a value system, and an\naction system (Spiro 1966: 98).\n\nMany have complained that arguments about how religion should\nbe defined seem unresolvable. To a great extent, however, this is\nbecause these arguments have not simply been about a particular aspect\nof society but rather have served as proxy in a debate about the\nstructure of human subjectivity. There is deep agreement among the\nrival positions insofar as they presuppose the\ncognitive-affective-conative model of being human. However, what we\nmight call a \u201cCartesian\u201d cohort argues that cognition is\nthe root of religious emotions and actions. This cohort includes the\n\u201cintellectualists\u201d whose influence stretches from Edward\nTylor and James Frazer to E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Robin Horton, Jack\nGoody, Melford Spiro, Stewart Guthrie, and J. Z. Smith, and it shapes\nmuch of the emerging field of cognitive science of religion (e.g.,\nBoyer\n 2001).[6]\n A \u201cHumean\u201d cohort disagrees, arguing that affect is what\ndrives human behavior and that cognition serves merely to justify the\nvalues one has already adopted. In theology and religious studies,\nthis feelings-centered approach is identified above all with the work\nof Friedrich Schleiermacher and Rudolf Otto, and with the tradition\ncalled phenomenology of religion, but it has had a place in\nanthropology of religion since Robert Marett (Tylor\u2019s student),\nand it is alive and well in the work of moral intuitionists (e.g.,\nHaidt 2012) and affect theory (e.g., Schaefer 2015). A\n\u201cKantian\u201d cohort treats beliefs and emotions regarding\nsupernatural realities as relatively unimportant and argues instead\nthat for religion the will is\n basic.[7]\n This approach treats a religion as at root a set of required actions\n(e.g., V\u00e1squez 2011; C. Smith 2017). These different approaches\ndisagree about the essence of religion, but all three camps operate\nwithin a shared account of the human. Thus, when William James\ndescribes religion as\n\n\nthe feelings, acts, and experiences of individual [people] in their\nsolitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to\nwhatever they may consider the divine. (1902 [1985: 34])\n\n\nhe is foregrounding an affective view and playing down (though not\ndenying) the cognitive. When James\u2019s Harvard colleague Alfred\nNorth Whitehead corrects him, saying that \u201c[r]eligion is what a\nperson does with their solitariness\u201d (1926: 3, emphasis\nadded), Whitehead stresses the conative, though Whitehead also insists\nthat feelings always play a role. These are primarily disagreements of\nemphasis that do not trouble this model of human subjectivity. There\nhave been some attempts to leave this three-part framework. For\nexample, some in the Humean camp have suggested that religion is\nessentially a particular feeling with zero cognition. But that\nromantic suggestion collapses under the inability to articulate how an\naffective state can be noncognitive but still identifiable as a\nparticular feeling (Proudfoot 1985).\n\nAlthough the three-sided model of the true, the beautiful, and the\ngood is a classic account of what any social group explicitly and\nimplicitly teaches, one aspect is still missing. To recognize the\nalways-presupposed material reality of the people who constitute the\nsocial group, even when this reality has not been conceptualized by\nthe group\u2019s members, one should also include the contributions\nof their bodies, habits, physical culture, and social structures. To\ninclude this dimension mnemonically, one can add a \u201cfourth\nC\u201d, for community. Catherine Albanese (1981) may have been the\nfirst to propose the idea of adding this materialist dimension. Ninian\nSmart\u2019s famous anatomy of religion (1996) has seven dimensions,\nnot four, but the two models are actually very similar. Smart calls\nthe affective dimension the \u201cexperiential and emotional\u201d,\nand then divides the cognitive dimension into two (\u201cdoctrinal\nand philosophical\u201d and \u201cnarrative and\nmythological\u201d), the conative into two (\u201cethical and\nlegal\u201d and \u201critual\u201d), and the communal into two\n(\u201csocial and institutional\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d).\nIn an attempt to dislodge the focus on human subjectivity found in the\nthree Cs, some have argued that the material dimension is the source\nof the others. They argue, in other words, that the cognitive,\naffective, and conative aspects of the members of a social group are\nnot the causes but rather the effects of the group\u2019s structured\npractices (e.g., Asad 1993: ch. 1\u20134; Lopez 1998). Some argue\nthat to understand religion in terms of beliefs, or even in terms of\nany subjective states, reflects a Protestant bias and that scholars of\nreligion should therefore shift attention from hidden mental states to\nthe visible institutional structures that produce them. Although the\nstructure/agency debate is still live in the social sciences, it is\nunlikely that one can give a coherent account of religion in terms of\ninstitutions or disciplinary practices without reintroducing mental\nstates such as judgements, decisions, and dispositions (Schilbrack\n2021).\n\nWhether a monothetic approach focuses on one essential property or a\nset, and whether that essence is the substance or the function of the\nreligion, those using this approach ask a Yes/No question regarding a\nsingle criterion. This approach therefore typically produces\nrelatively clear lines between what is and is not religion. Given\nTylor\u2019s monothetic definition, for instance, a form of life must\ninclude belief in spiritual beings to be a religion; a form of life\nlacking this property would not be a religion, even if it included\nbelief in a general order of existence that participants took as their\nultimate concern, and even if that form of life included rituals,\nethics, and scriptures. In a famous discussion, Melford Spiro (1966)\nworks with a Tylorean definition and argues exactly this: lacking a\nbelief in superhuman beings, Theravada Buddhism, for instance, is\nsomething other than a\n religion.[8]\n For Spiro, there is nothing pejorative about this classification.\n\n\nHaving combatted the notion that \u201cwe\u201d have religion (which\nis \u201cgood\u201d) and \u201cthey\u201d have superstition (which\nis \u201cbad\u201d), why should we be dismayed if it be discovered\nthat that society x does not have religion as we have defined\nthe term? (1966: 88)\n\n2.2 Polythetic approaches\n\nThat a concept always corresponds to something possessing a defining\nproperty is a very old idea. This assumption undergirds Plato\u2019s\nEuthyphro and other dialogues in which Socrates pushes his\ninterlocutors to make that hidden, defining property explicit, and\nthis pursuit has provided a model for much not only of philosophy, but\nof the theorizing in all fields. The traditional assumption is that\nevery entity has some essence that makes it the thing it is, and every\ninstance that is accurately described by a concept of that entity will\nhave that essence. The recent argument that there is an alternative\nstructure\u2014that a concept need not have necessary and sufficient\ncriteria for its application\u2014has been called a \u201cconceptual\nrevolution\u201d (Needham 1975: 351), \u201cone of the greatest and\nmost valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the\nrepublic of letters\u201d (Bambrough 1960\u20131: 207).\n\nIn discussions of the concept religion, this\nanti-essentialist approach is usually traced to Ludwig Wittgenstein\n(1953, posthumous). Wittgenstein argues that, in some cases, when one\nconsiders the variety of instances described with a given concept, one\nsees that among them there are multiple features that \u201ccrop up\nand disappear\u201d, the result being \u201ca complicated network of\nsimilarities overlapping and criss-crossing\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a768).  The instances falling under some concepts lack a single\ndefining property but instead have a family resemblance to each other\nin that each one resembles some of the others in different ways. All\npolythetic approaches reject the monothetic idea that a concept\nrequires necessary and sufficient criteria. But unappreciated is the\nfact that polythetic approaches come in different kinds, operating\nwith different logics. Here are three.\n\nThe most basic kind of polythetic approach holds that membership in a\ngiven class is not determined by the presence of a single crucial\ncharacteristic. Instead, the concept maps a cluster of characteristics\nand, to count as a member of that class, a particular case has to have\na certain number of them, no particular one of which is required. To\nillustrate, imagine that there are five characteristics typical of\nreligions (call this the \u201cproperties set\u201d) and that, to be\na religion, a form of life has to have a minimum of three of them\n(call this the \u201cthreshold number\u201d). Because this\nillustration limits the number of characteristics in the properties\nset, I will call this first kind a \u201cbounded\u201d polythetic\napproach. For example, the five religion-making characteristics could\nbe these:\n\nbelief in superempirical beings or powers,\nethical norms,\nworship rituals,\nparticipation believed to bestow benefits on participants,\nand\nthose who participate in this form of life see themselves as a\ndistinct community.\n\n\nUnderstanding the concept religion in this polythetic way\nproduces a graded hierarchy of\n instances.[9]\n A form of life that has all five of these characteristics would be a\nprototypical example of a religion. Historically speaking,\nprototypical examples of the concept are likely to be instances to\nwhich the concept was first applied. Psychologically speaking, they\nare also likely to be the example that comes to mind first to those\nwho use the concept. For instance, robins and finches are prototypical\nexamples of a bird, and when one is prompted to name a bird, people\nare more likely to name a robin or a finch than an ostrich or a\npenguin. A form of life that has only four of these characteristics\nwould nevertheless still be a clear example of a\n religion.[10]\n If a form of life has only three, then it would be a\nborderline example. A form of life that has only two of these\ncharacteristics would not be included in the category, though such\ncases might be considered \u201cquasi-religions\u201d and they might\nbe the most interesting social forms to compare to religions (J. E.\nSmith 1994). A form of life that only had one of the five\ncharacteristics would be unremarkable. The forms of life that had\nthree, four, or five of these characteristics would not be an\nunrelated set but rather a \u201cfamily\u201d with multiple shared\nfeatures, but no one characteristic (not even belief in superempirical\nbeings or powers) possessed by all of them. On this polythetic\napproach, the concept religion has no essence, and a member\nof this family that only lacked one of the five\ncharacteristics\u2014no matter which one\u2014would still\nclearly be a\n religion.[11]\n As Benson Saler (1993) points out, one can use this non-essentialist\napproach not only for the concept religion but also for the\nelements within a religion (sacrifice, scripture, and so on) and to\nindividual religions (Christianity, Hinduism, and so on).\n\nSome have claimed that, lacking an essence, polythetic approaches to\nreligion make the concept so vague that it becomes useless\n(e.g., Fitzgerald 2000: 72\u20133; Martin 2009: 167). Given the\nfocused example of a \u201cbounded\u201d approach in the previous\nparagraph and the widespread adoption of polythetic approaches in the\nbiological sciences, this seems clearly false. However, it is true\nthat one must pay attention to the parameters at work in a polythetic\napproach. Using a properties set with only five elements produces a\nvery focused class, but the properties set is simply a list of\nsimilarities among at least two of the members of a class, and since\nthe class of religions might have hundreds of members, one could\neasily create a properties set that is much bigger. Not long after\nWittgenstein\u2019s death, a \u201cbounded\u201d polythetic\napproach was applied to the concept religion by William\nAlston who identified nine religion-making\n characteristics.[12]\n Southwold (1978) has twelve; Rem Edwards (1972) has fourteen and\nleaves room for more. But there is no reason why one might not work\nwith a properties set for religion with dozens or even\nhundreds of shared properties. Half a century ago, Rodney Needham\n(1975: 361) mentions a computer program that sorted 1500 different\nbacterial strains according to 200 different properties. As J. Z.\nSmith (1982: ch. 1) argues, treating the concept religion in\nthis way can lead to surprising discoveries of patterns within the\nclass and the co-appearance of properties that can lead to explanatory\ntheories. The second key parameter for a polythetic approach is the\nthreshold number. Alston does not stipulate the number of\ncharacteristics a member of the class has to have, saying simply,\n\u201cWhen enough of these characteristics are present to a\nsufficient degree, we have a religion\u201d (1967: 142). Needham\n(1975) discusses the sensible idea that each member has a\nmajority of the properties, but this is not a requirement of\npolythetic approaches. The critics are right that as one increases the\nsize of the properties set and decreases the threshold number, the\nresulting category becomes more and more diffuse. This can produce a\nclass that is so sprawling that it is difficult to use for empirical\nstudy.\n\nScholars of religion who have used a polythetic approach have\ntypically worked with a \u201cbounded\u201d approach (that is, with\na properties set that is fixed), but this is not actually the view for\nwhich Wittgenstein himself argues. Wittgenstein\u2019s goal is to\ndraw attention to the fact that the actual use of concepts is\ntypically not bound: \u201cthe extension of the concept is\nnot closed by a frontier\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a767). We can\ncall this an \u201copen\u201d polythetic approach. To grasp the open\napproach, consider a group of people who have a concept they apply to\na certain range of instances. In time, a member of the group\nencounters something new that resembles the other instances enough in\nher eyes that she applies the concept to it. When the linguistic\ncommunity adopts this novel application, the extension of the concept\ngrows. If their use of the concept is \u201copen\u201d, however,\nthen, as the group adds a new member to the category named by a\nconcept, properties of that new member that had not been part of the\nearlier uses can be added to the properties set and thereby increase\nthe range of legitimate applications of the concept in the future. We\nmight say that a bounded polythetic approach produces concepts that\nare fuzzy, and an open polythetic approach produces concepts that are\nfuzzy and evolving. Timothy Williamson calls this \u201cthe\ndynamic quality of family resemblance concepts\u201d (1994: 86). One\ncould symbolize the shift of properties over time this way:\n\n\n\nReligion 1:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE \n\nReligion 2:\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF \n\nReligion 3:\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG \n\nReligion 4:\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH \n\nReligion 5:\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI \n\nReligion 6:\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ \n\n\u2026  \n\n\nWittgenstein famously illustrated this open polythetic approach with\nthe concept game, and he also applied it to the concepts of\nlanguage and number (Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a767). If we substitute our concept as Wittgenstein\u2019s\nexample, however, his treatment fits religion just as\nwell:\n\n\nWhy do we call something a \u201creligion\u201d? Well, perhaps\nbecause it has a direct relationship with several things that have\nhitherto been called religion; and this can be said to give an\nindirect relationship to other things we call the same\nname. (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a767)\n\n\nGiven an open polythetic approach, a concept evolves in the light of\nthe precedents that speakers recognize, although, over time, what\npeople come to label with the concept can become very different from\nthe original use.\n\nIn the academic study of religions, discussions of monothetic and\npolythetic approaches have primarily been in service of developing a\ndefinition of the\n term.[13]\n How can alternate definitions of religion be assessed? If\none were to offer a lexical definition (that is, a description of what\nthe term means in common usage, as with a dictionary definition), then\nthe definition one offers could be shown to be wrong. In common usage,\nfor example, Buddhism typically is considered a religion and\ncapitalism typically is not. On this point, some believe erroneously\nthat one can correct a definition by pointing to some fact about the\nreferents of the term. One sees this assumption, for example, in those\nwho argue that the western discovery of Buddhism shows that theistic\ndefinitions of religion are wrong (e.g., Southwold 1978:\n367). One can correct a real or lexical definition in this way, but\nnot a stipulative definition, that is, a description of the meaning\nthat one assigns to the term. When one offers a stipulative\ndefinition, that definition cannot be wrong. Stipulative definitions\nare assessed not by whether they are true or false but rather by their\nusefulness, and that assessment will be purpose-relative (cf. Berger\n1967: 175). De Muckadell (2014) rejects stipulative definitions of\nreligion for this reason, arguing that one cannot critique\nthem and that they force scholars simply to \u201caccept whatever\ndefinition is offered\u201d. She gives the example of a problematic\nstipulative definition of religion as \u201cice-skating\nwhile singing\u201d which, she argues, can only be rejected by using\na real definition of religion that shows the ice-skating\ndefinition to be false. However, even without knowing the real essence\nof religion, one can critique a stipulative definition, either for\nbeing less adequate or appropriate for a particular purpose (such as\nstudying forms of life across cultures) or, as with the ice-skating\nexample, for being so far from a lexical definition that it is\nadequate or appropriate for almost no purpose.\n\nPolythetic definitions are increasingly popular today as people seek\nto avoid the claim that an evolving social category has an ahistorical\n essence.[14]\n However, the difference between these two approaches is not that\nmonothetic definitions fasten on a single property whereas polythetic\ndefinitions recognize more. Monothetic definitions can be\nmultifactorial, as we have seen, and they can recognize just as many\nproperties that are \u201ccommon\u201d or even \u201ctypical\u201d\nof religions, without being essential. The difference is also not that\nthe monothetic identification of the essence of religion\nreflects an ethnocentrism that polythetic approaches avoid. The\npolythetic identification of a prototypical religion is equally\nethnocentric. The difference between them, rather, is that a\nmonothetic definition sorts instances with a Yes/No mechanism and is\ntherefore digital, and a polythetic definition produces gradations and\nis therefore analog. It follows that a monothetic definition treats a\nset of instances that all possess the one defining property as\nequally religion, whereas a polythetic definition produces a\ngray area for instances that are more prototypical or less so. This\nmakes a monothetic definition superior for cases (for example, legal\ncases) in which one seeks a Yes/No answer. Even if an open polythetic\napproach accurately describes how a concept operates, therefore, one\nmight, for purposes of focus or clarity, prefer to work with a closed\npolythetic account that limits the properties set, or even with a\nmonothetic approach that limits the properties set to one. That is,\none might judge that it is valuable to treat the concept\nreligion as structurally fuzzy or temporally fluid, but\nnevertheless place boundaries on the forms of life one will\ncompare.\n\nThis strategy gives rise to a third kind of polythetic approach, one\nthat stipulates that one property (or one set of properties) is\nrequired. Call this an \u201canchored\u201d polythetic definition.\nConsistently treating concepts as tools, Wittgenstein suggests this\n\u201canchored\u201d idea when he writes that when we look at the\nhistory of a concept,\n\n\nwhat we see is something constantly fluctuating \u2026 [but we might\nnevertheless] set over against this fluctuation something more fixed,\njust as one paints a stationary picture of the constantly altering\nface of the landscape. (1974: 77)\n\n\nGiven a stipulated \u201canchor\u201d, a concept will then possess a\nnecessary property, and this property reintroduces essentialism. Such\na definition nevertheless still reflects a polythetic approach because\nthe presence of the required property is not sufficient to make\nsomething a religion. To illustrate this strategy, one might stipulate\nthat the only forms of life one will consider a religion will\ninclude\n\n(A)\na belief in superempirical beings or powers\n\n\n(thereby excluding nationalism and capitalism, for example), but the\npresence of this property does not suffice to count this form of life\nas a religion. Consider the properties set introduced above that also\nincludes\n\n(B)\nethical norms,\n(C)\nworship rituals,\n(D)\nparticipation believed to bestow benefits on participants,\nand\n(E)\nthose who participate in this form of life see themselves as a\ndistinct community.\n\n\nIf the threshold number is still three, then to be a religion, a form\nof life would have to have three of these properties, one of which\nmust be\n (A).\n An anchored definition of religion like this would have the benefits\nof the other polythetic definitions. For example, it would not produce\na clear line between religion and nonreligion but would instead\narticulate gradations between different forms of life (or between\nversions of one form of life at different times) that are less or more\nprototypically religious. However, given its anchor, it would produce\na more focused range of\n cases.[15]\n In this way, the use of an anchor might both reflect the contemporary\ncosmological view of the concept religion and also address\nthe criticism that polythetic approaches make a concept too vague.\n3. Reflexivity, Reference, and Skepticism\n\nOver the past forty years or so, there has been a reflexive turn in\nthe social sciences and humanities as scholars have pulled the camera\nback, so to speak, to examine the constructed nature of the objects\npreviously taken for granted as unproblematically \u201cthere\u201d.\nReflexive scholars have argued that the fact that what counts as\nreligion shifts according to one\u2019s definition reflects an\narbitrariness in the use of the term. They argue that the fact that\nreligion is not a concept found in all cultures but rather a\ntool invented at a certain time and place, by certain people for their\nown purposes, and then imposed on others, reveals its political\ncharacter. The perception that religion is a politically\nmotivated conceptual invention has therefore led some to skepticism\nabout whether the concept picks out something real in the world. As\nwith instrumentalism in philosophy of science, then, reflection on\nreligion has raised doubts about the ontological status of\nthe referent of one\u2019s technical term.\n\nA watershed text for the reflexive turn regarding the concept\nreligion is Jonathan Z. Smith\u2019s Imagining\nReligion (1982). Smith engages simultaneously in comparing\nreligions and in analyzing the scholarly practice of comparison. A\ncentral theme of his essays is that the concept religion (and\nsubcategories such as world religions, Abrahamic\nfaiths, or nonliterate traditions) are not scientific\nterms but often reflect the unrecognized biases of those who use these\nconcepts to sort their world into those who are or are not \u201clike\n us\u201d.[16]\n Smith shows that, again and again, the concept religion was\nshaped by implicit Protestant assumptions, if not explicit Protestant\napologetics. In the short preface to that book, Smith famously\nsays,\n\n\n[T]here is no data for religion. Religion is solely\nthe creation of the scholar\u2019s study. It is created for the\nscholar\u2019s analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of\ncomparison and generalization. Religion has no independent existence\napart from the academy. (1982: xi, italics in original)\n\n\nThis dramatic statement has sometimes been taken as Smith\u2019s\nassertion that the concept religion has no referent. However,\nin his actual practice of comparing societies, Smith is not a\nnonrealist about religion. In the first place, he did not\nthink that the constructed nature of religion was something\nparticular to this concept: any judgement that two things\nwere similar or different in some respect presupposed a process of\nselection, juxtaposition, and categorization by the observer. This is\nthe process of imagination in his book\u2019s title. Second, Smith\ndid not think that the fact that concepts were human products\nundermined the possibility that they successfully corresponded to\nentities in the world: an invented concept for social structures can\nhelp one discover religion\u2014not \u201cinvent\u201d\nit\u2014even in societies whose members did not know the\n concept.[17]\n His slogan is that one\u2019s (conceptual) map is not the same as\nand should be tested and rectified by the (non-conceptual) territory\n(J. Z. Smith 1978). Lastly, Smith did not think that scholars should\ncease to use religion as a redescriptive or second-order\ncategory to study people in history who lacked a comparable concept.\nOn the contrary, he chastised scholars of religion for resting within\ntradition-specific studies, avoiding cross-cultural comparisons, and\nnot defending the coherence of the generic concept. He writes that\nscholars of religion should be\n\n\nprepared to insist, in some explicit and coherent fashion, on the\npriority of some generic category of religion. (1995: 412; cf. 1998:\n281\u20132)\n\n\nSmith himself repeatedly uses religion and related technical\nterms he invented, such as \u201clocative religion\u201d, to\nilluminate social structures that operate whether or not those so\ndescribed had named those structures themselves\u2014social\nstructures that exist, as his 1982 subtitle says, from Babylon to\nJonestown.\n\nThe second most influential book in the reflexive turn in religious\nstudies is Talal Asad\u2019s Genealogies of Religion (1993).\nAdopting Michel Foucault\u2019s \u201cgenealogical\u201d approach,\nAsad seeks to show that the concept religion operating in\ncontemporary anthropology has been shaped by assumptions that are\nChristian (insofar as one takes belief as a mental state\ncharacteristic of all religions) and modern (insofar as one treats\nreligion as essentially distinct from politics). Asad\u2019s\nFoucauldian point is that though people may have all kinds of\nreligious beliefs, experiences, moods, or motivations, the mechanism\nthat inculcates them will be the disciplining techniques of some\nauthorizing power and for this reason one cannot treat religion as\nsimply inner states. Like Smith, then, Asad asks scholars to shift\ntheir attention to the concept religion and to recognize that\nassumptions baked into the concept have distorted our grasp of the\nhistorical realities. However, also like Smith, Asad does not draw a\nnonrealist\n conclusion.[18]\n For Asad, religion names a real thing that would operate in\nthe world even had the concept not been invented, namely, \u201ca\ncoherent existential complex\u201d (2001: 217). Asad\u2019s critical\naim is not to undermine the idea that religion exists qua social\nreality but rather to undermine the idea that religion is essentially\nan interior state independent of social power. He points out that\nanthropologists like Clifford Geertz adopt a hermeneutic approach to\nculture that treats actions as if they are texts that say something,\nand this approach has reinforced the attention given to the meaning of\nreligious symbols, deracinated from their social and historical\ncontext. Asad seeks to balance this bias for the subjective with a\ndisciplinary approach that sees human subjectivity as also the product\nof social structures. Smith and Asad are therefore examples of\nscholars who critique the concept religion without denying\nthat it can still refer to something in the world, something that\nexists even before it is named. They are able, so to speak, to look at\none\u2019s conceptual window without denying that the window provides\na perspective on things outside.\n\nOther critics have gone farther. They build upon the claims that the\nconcept religion is an invented category and that its modern\nsemantic expansion went hand in hand with European colonialism, and\nthey argue that people should cease treating religion as if\nit corresponds to something that exists outside the sphere of modern\nEuropean influence. It is common today to hear the slogan that there\nis no such \u201cthing\u201d as religion. In some cases, the point\nof rejecting thing-hood is to deny that religion names a\ncategory, all the instances of which focus on belief in the same kind\nof object\u2014that is, the slogan is a rejection of substantive\ndefinitions of the concept (e.g., Possamai 2018: ch. 5). In this case,\nthe objection bolsters a functional definition and does not deny that\nreligion corresponds to a functionally distinct kind of form\nof life. Here, the \u201cno such thing\u201d claim reflects the\nunsettled question, mentioned above, about the grounds of substantive\ndefinitions of \u201creligion\u201d. In other cases, the point of\nthis objection is to deny that religion names a defining\ncharacteristic of any kind\u2014that is, the slogan is a rejection of\nall monothetic definitions of the concept. Perhaps religion\n(or a religion, like Judaism) should always be referred to in the\nplural (\u201cJudaisms\u201d) rather than the singular. In this\ncase, the objection bolsters a polythetic definition and does not deny\nthat religion corresponds to a distinct family of forms of\nlife. Here, the \u201cno such thing\u201d claim rejects the\nassumption that religion has an essence. Despite their negativity,\nthese two objections to the concept are still realist in that they do\nnot deny that the phrase \u201ca religion\u201d can correspond to a\nform of life operating in the world.\n\nMore radically, one sees a denial of this realism, for example, in the\ncritique offered by Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1962). Smith\u2019s\nthesis is that in many different cultures, people developed a concept\nfor the individuals they considered pious, but they did not develop a\nconcept for a generic social entity, a system of beliefs and practices\nrelated to superempirical realities. Before modernity, \u201cthere is\nno such entity [as religion and] \u2026 the use of a plural, or with\nan article, is false\u201d (1962: 326, 194; cf. 144). Smith\nrecommends dropping religion. Not only did those so described\nlack the concept, but the use of the concept also treats\npeople\u2019s behavior as if the phrase \u201ca religion\u201d\nnames something in addition to that behavior. A methodological\nindividualist, Smith denies that groups have any reality not explained\nby the individuals who constitute them. What one finds in history,\nthen, is religious people, and so the adjective is useful,\nbut there are no religious entities above and beyond those people, and\nso the noun reifies an abstraction. Smith contends that\n\n\n[n]either religion in general nor any one of the religions \u2026 is\nin itself an intelligible entity, a valid object of inquiry or of\nconcern either for the scholar or for the [person] of faith. (1962:\n12)\n\n\nMore radical still are the nonrealists who argue that the concepts\nreligion, religions, and religious are all\nchimerical. Often drawing on post-structuralist arguments, these\ncritics propose that the notion that religions exist is simply an\nillusion generated by the discourse about them (e.g., McCutcheon 1997;\n2018; Fitzgerald 2000; 2007; 2017; Dubuisson 1998; 2019). As Timothy\nFitzgerald writes, the concept religion\n\n\npicks out nothing and it clarifies nothing \u2026 the word has no\ngenuine analytical work to do and its continued use merely contributes\nto the general illusion that it has a genuine referent \u2026.\n(2000: 17, 14; also 4)\n\n\nAdvocates of this position sometimes call their approach the\n\u201cCritical Study of Religion\u201d or simply \u201cCritical\nReligion\u201d, a name that signals their shift away from the\npre-critical assumption that religion names entities in the\nworld and to a focus on who invented the concept, the shifting\ncontrast terms it has had, and the uses to which it has been\n put.[19]\n Like the concept of witches or the concept of biological races (e.g.,\nNye 2020), religion is a fiction (Fitzgerald 2015) or a\nfabrication (McCutcheon 2018), a concept invented and deployed not to\nrespond to some reality in the world but rather to sort and control\npeople. The classification of something as \u201creligion\u201d is\nnot neutral but\n\n\na political activity, and one particularly related to the colonial and\nimperial situation of a foreign power rendering newly encountered\nsocieties digestible and manipulable in terms congenial to its own\nculture and agenda. (McCutcheon & Arnal 2012: 107)\n\n\nAs part of European colonial projects, the concept has been imposed on\npeople who lacked it and did not consider anything in their society\n\u201ctheir religion\u201d. In fact, the concept was for centuries\nthe central tool used to rank societies on a scale from primitive to\ncivilized. To avoid this \u201cconceptual violence\u201d or\n\u201cepistemic imperialism\u201d (Dubuisson 2019: 137), scholars\nneed to cease naturalizing this term invented in modern Europe and\ninstead historicize it, uncovering the conditions that gave rise to\nthe concept and the interests it serves. The study of religions\noutside Europe should end. As Timothy Fitzgerald writes, \u201cThe\ncategory \u2018religion\u2019 should be the object, not the tool, of\nanalysis\u201d (2000: 106; also 2017: 125; cf. McCutcheon 2018:\n18).\n\nInspired by the post-structuralist critiques that religion\ndoes not apply to cultures that lack the concept, some historians have\nargued that the term should no longer be used to describe any\npremodern societies, even in Europe. For example, Brent Nongbri\n(2013), citing McCutcheon, argues that though it is common to speak of\nreligions existing in the past, human history until the concept\nemerged in modernity is more accurately understood as a time\n\u201cbefore religion\u201d. His aim is \u201cto dispel the\ncommonly held idea that there is such a thing as \u2018ancient\nreligion\u2019\u201d (2013: 8). Citing Nongbri, Carlin Barton and\nDaniel Boyarin (2016) argue that the Latin religio and the\nGreek thr\u0113skeia do not correspond to the modern\nunderstanding of religion and those studying antiquity should\ncease translating them with that concept. There was no \u201cRoman\nreligious reality\u201d, they say (2016: 19). These historians\nsuggest that if a culture does not have the concept of X,\nthen the reality of X does not exist for that culture.\nBoyarin calls this position \u201cnominalism\u201d, arguing that\nreligion is\n\n\nnot in any possible way a \u201creal\u201d object, an object that is\nhistorical or ontological, before the term comes to be used. (2017:\n25)\n\n\nThese critics are right to draw attention to the fact that in the mind\nof most contemporary people, the concept religion does imply\nfeatures that did not exist in ancient societies, but the argument\nthat religion did not exist in antiquity involves a sleight of hand.\nNone of these historians argues that people in antiquity did not\nbelieve in gods or other spiritual beings, did not seek to interact\nwith them with sacrifices and other rituals, did not create temples or\nscriptures, and so on. If one uses Tylor\u2019s definition of\nreligion as belief in spiritual beings or James\u2019s\ndefinition of religion as adjusting one\u2019s life to an\nunseen order\u2014or any of the other definitions considered in\nthis entry\u2014then religion did exist in antiquity.\nWhat these historians are pointing out is that ancient practices\nrelated to the gods permeated their cultures. As Nongbri puts\nit,\n\n\nTo be sure, ancient people had words to describe proper reverence of\nthe gods, but \u2026 [t]he very idea of \u201cbeing\nreligious\u201d requires a companion notion of what it would mean to\nbe \u201cnot religious\u201d and this dichotomy was not part of the\nancient world; (2013: 4)\n\n\nthere was no \u201cdiscrete sphere of religion existing prior to the\nmodern period\u201d (2019: 1, typo corrected). And Barton and\nBoyarin:\n\n\nThe point is not \u2026 that there weren\u2019t practices with\nrespect to \u201cgods\u201d (of whatever sort) but that these\npractices were not divided off into separate spheres \u2026. (2016:\n4)\n\n\nSteve Mason also argues that religion did not exist in antiquity since\nreligion is \u201ca voluntary sphere of activity, separate in\nprinciple\u201d from politics, work, entertainment, and military\nservice (2019: 29). In short, what people later came to conceptualize\nas religion was in antiquity not a freestanding entity. The nominalist\nargument, in other words, adds to the definition of the concept\nreligion a distinctively modern feature (usually some version\nof \u201cthe separation of church and state\u201d), and then argues\nthat the referent of this now-circumscribed concept did not exist in\nantiquity. Their argument is not that religion did not exist outside\nmodernity, but that modern religion did not exist outside\nmodernity.\n\nThese post-structuralist and nominalist arguments that deny that\nreligion is \u201cout there\u201d have a realist alternative.\nAccording to this alternative, there is a world independent of human\nconceptualization, and something can be real and it can even affect\none\u2019s life, whether or not any human beings have identified it.\nThis is true of things whose existence does not depend on collective\nagreement, like biochemical signaling cascades or radioactive beta\nparticles, and it is equally true of things whose existence does\ndepend on collective agreement, like kinship structures, linguistic\nrules, and religious commitments. A realist about social structures\nholds that a person can be in a bilateral kinship system, can speak a\nUralic language, and can be a member of a religion\u2014even if they\nlack these concepts.\n\nThis realist claim that social structures have existed without being\nconceptualized raises the question: if human beings had different ways\nof practicing religion since prehistoric times, why and when did\npeople \u201cfinally\u201d create the taxon? Almost every scholar\ninvolved in the reflexive turn says that religion is a modern\n invention.[20]\n The critique of the concept religion then becomes part of\ntheir critique of modernity. Given the potent uses of\nreligion\u2014to categorize certain cultures as godless and\ntherefore inferior or, later, to categorize certain cultures as\nsuperstitious and therefore backwards\u2014the significance of the\ncritique of religion for postcolonial and decolonial\nscholarship is undeniable. Nevertheless, it is not plausible that\nmodern Europeans were the first to want a generic concept for\ndifferent ways of interacting with gods. It is easy to imagine that if\nthe way that a people worship their gods permeates their work, art,\nand politics, and they do not know of alternative ways, then it would\nnot be likely that they would have created a concept for it. There is\nlittle need for a generic concept that abstracts a particular aspect\nof one\u2019s culture as one option out of many until one is in a\nsustained pluralistic situation. The actions that today are\ncategorized as religious practices\u2014burial rites, the making of\nofferings, the imitation of divinized ancestors\u2014may have existed\nfor tens of thousands of years without the practitioners experiencing\nthat diversity or caring to name it. Nevertheless, it is likely that a\ndesire to compare the rules by which different people live in relation\nto their gods would have emerged in many parts of the world long\nbefore modernity. One would expect to find people developing such\nsocial abstractions as cities and then empires emerged and their\ncultures came into contact with each other. From this realist\nperspective, it is no surprise that, according to the detailed and\nexample-filled argument of Barton and Boyarin (2016), the first use of\nreligion as a generic social category, distinct from the\nconcept of politics, for the ways that people interact with\ngods is not a product of the Renaissance, the Reformation, or modern\ncolonialism at all, but can be found in the writings of Josephus\n(37\u2013c. 100 CE) and Tertullian (c. 155\u2013c. 220\n CE).[21]\n From the realist perspective, it is no surprise to see the\ndevelopment of analogous terms in medieval China, centuries before\ninteraction with Europeans (Campany 2003, 2012, 2018) and in medieval\nIslam (Abbasi 2020, 2021). The emergence of social kinds does not wait\non language, and the development of language for social kinds is not\nonly a Western project. If this is right, then the development of a\nconcept for\u00a0religion as a social genus is at least two thousand\nyears old, though the social reality so labeled would be much\nolder.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abbasi, Rushain, 2020, \u201cDid Premodern Muslims Distinguish\nthe Religious and the Secular?
