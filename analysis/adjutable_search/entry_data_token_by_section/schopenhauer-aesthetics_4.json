    "main_text": "Aesthetic Experience || Objective side\n3.2 Objective side\n\n\nThe objective side of aesthetic experience is necessarily correlated\nand occurs simultaneously with aesthetic will-lessness: It is the\nperception of what Schopenhauer terms the \u201cPlatonic\nIdeas.\u201d  The will qua thing in itself, on\nSchopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics, objectifies itself at particular\ngrades; the Ideas correspond to these grades of objectification. The\nIdea in each particular thing is that which is enduring and essential\nin it (WWR I, 206) and can only be intuited in aesthetic experience of\nnature and art (WWR I, 182).\n\n\nThe ontological status and the coherence of the Ideas within\nSchopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics has been a bone of contention for\ncommentators (see Hamlyn 1980, Chapter 6; Young 1987, 2005;\nAtwell 1995). The problem is this: On Schopenhauer\u2019s account\nthere are only two aspects of the world, first, the world as will (the\nthing in itself or \u201cwill\u201d); and, second, the world as\nrepresentation.  The Ideas, however, fit neatly into\nneither aspect. On the one hand, the Ideas seem to\nbelong to the world as will: In virtue of their being the\n\u201cimmediate and therefore adequate objecthood of the thing in\nitself\u201d (WWR I, 197) the Ideas are independent of the cognitive\nconditions of time, space and causality (WWR I, 204). Yet, unlike the\nwill qua thing in itself, the Ideas may be directly perceived\nby a subject, and thus are more akin to representations.  In\ncontrast to ordinary representations, however, the Ideas revealed in\nthe phenomenal object have not yet entered into the particularlizing\nforms of the PSR (most notably, space, time and causality), they are\nrather universals.\n\n\nA further difficulty for the tenability of the Ideas in\nSchopenhauer\u2019s system is the fact that he often refers to Ideas\nin the plural. For Schopenhauer, space and time are the\nprincipium individuationis; but since the Ideas are\nindependent of space and time, it is not clear how they can be\nindividuated at all. One option for understanding the place of the\nIdeas in his system would be to see them as playing the role of an\nepistemic rather than metaphysical bridge between the one will and the\nmany phenomena. This helps to explain their individuated status\nas follows: In a suggestive metaphor, Schopenhauer likens the Ideas to\n\u201csteps on the ladder of the objectivation of that one will, of\nthe true thing in itself\u201d (WWR I, 198); if one understands the\n\u201cladder\u201d\u2014the ensemble of Ideas\u2014as part of the\nworld as representation, then each Idea\u2014each \u201cstep\u201d on the\nladder\u2014is a universal perceived in various particular\nspatiotemporal objects. The Ideas then are the essential features of\nobjects or states of affairs that human beings may perceive when their\nattention is focussed squarely on the \u2018what\u2019 rather than on\nthe \u2018why\u2019 or \u2018wherefore\u2019 of phenomena. It\nshould be noted, however, that the Ideas are not abstracted by the\nsubject as are concepts on Schopenhauer\u2019s view, but are, rather,\nperceived directly in them.  In sum, the Ideas seem to\nmake the most sense within his system as \u201cabstract\nobjects\u201d\u2014objects that are not spatiotemporal, which do not\nstand in causal relationship with anything, and which have not been\nabstracted like a concept, but rather, are the real, objective, essential aspects\nof the world as representation as perceived by a will-less subject (WWR\nI, 234, 236). The crucial role that they play in\nSchopenhauer\u2019s system is that they are the objects of all\naesthetic experience\u2014both of the artist and spectator\u2014and their\nperception constitutes insight into the essential nature of the\nphenomenal world.\n",
