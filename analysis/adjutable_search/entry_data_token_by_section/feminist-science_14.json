    "main_text": "Recent Areas of Study: The Brain and Human Behavior || Neurofeminism\n6.1 Neurofeminism\n\nThe development of neuroscience in the twentieth and twenty-first\ncentury resulted in feminist examination of these\nfields\u2014particularly in connection with cognitive science and\nresearch on differences in the brains of men and women (Bluhm,\nJacobson, & Maibom 2012; Fine 2010; Pitts-Taylor 2016a;\nJordan-Young 2010). Feminist work in this vein approaches neuroscience\nin ways similar to the approaches described in the previous sections.\nIt involves investigating sexist bias through examining background\nassumptions and other means through which such bias could enter, as\nwell as identifying background beliefs that shape research.\n\nIt may be somewhat misleading to treat neuroscience as a new area of\ninterest from a feminist perspective. As Bluhm, Jacobson, and Maibom\npoint out, \n\n\nFeminist neuroscientists were among the first to critique androcentric\ntheories and assumptions in their disciplines,\u2026. (Bluhm,\nJacobson, & Maibom 2012: 6) \n\n\nHowever, the twenty-first century has seen substantial advances in\nneuroscience and cognitive science coupled with new tools for studying\nthe brain. These advances have been accompanied by worries about how\nandrocentric assumptions have persisted in research and how they\nmanifest in the use of new ways of investigating the brain, such as\nfMRI.\n\nOne research area that has attracted feminist attention is the study\nof sex differences in the brain. There is a considerable range of work\nthat might qualify under this heading. As an example, Rebecca\nJordan-Young\u2019s book Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of\nSex Differences (2010) focuses on a dominant approach in that\narea of study which she dubs \u201cbrain organization\nresearch\u201d. She argues that the main theoretical framework\nguiding sex difference research is that \n\n\nprenatal hormone exposures cause sexual differentiation of the\nbrain\u2014that is, early hormones create permanent masculine or\nfeminine patterns of desire, personality, temperament, and cognition.\n(Jordan-Young 2010: xi) \n\n\nThe prenatal hormone exposure referred to here is the flooding of\nandrogens during fetal development prior to which the there is no sex\ndifferentiation between fetuses. The organizational hypothesis is that\nthis same infusion of androgens that determines differential\nreproductive development also determines brain development and\nultimately differential brain structure in males and females.\nJordan-Young is particularly interested in how conclusions are drawn\nabout sexuality from brain organization research. Her main concern\nabout the uncritical use of the hormonal theory of brain organization\nis that alternative hypotheses\u2014specifically the hypothesis that\nsocial factors, expectations, and learned behaviors play a role in\nbrain organization\u2014fail to be considered adequately.\n\nAs Jordan-Young acknowledges, most brain organizational researchers\nclaim to be interactionists\u2014that is, they recognize that social\nfactors play some role and that both hormones and society affect the\nbrain. However, she argues that their accounts are typically additive\nrather than truly interactive, with the hormonal influence acting\nfirst and social influence coming in later. Additive accounts treat\nthe causal factors as separable whereas a truly interactive account\nwould not do so. Jordan-Young credits Doell and Longino\u2019s work\non the topic with having pointed this out decades ago (1988: 59).\n\nThe failure to question organization theory is one point of\nJordan-Young\u2019s account, but she also considers other assumptions\nabout hormones, the relationship between sex and gender, and\nsexuality. Specifically, in considering other assumptions about\nhormones, she notes that the understanding of steroid hormones from\nthe onset of this research was that some were masculine and some\nfeminine. (For this account she relies on the work of Nelly Oudshoorn\n(1994)). Further, she argues that thinking of hormones in this\nway\u2014as androgens (male hormones) and estrogens (female\nhormones)\u2014is not without problems for researchers that make\nthese assumptions, since both types of hormones are present in both\nmales and females\u2014an anomaly the approach does not account for\n(see also\n section 5.1).\n She identifies this as a failure to take into account evidence that\ndoes not fit with the prior interpretation of hormones as sexed. Thus\nfeatures of accounts depending on organization theory appear to be\nboth value-laden and held dogmatically.\n\nJordan-Young is using patterns of feminist critique similar to those\ndescribed in previous sections. She interrogates unexamined\nassumptions, traces the ways in which those assumptions shape the\nunderstanding of the objects of inquiry and determine what will count\nas evidence. She reveals the line of thought from the\nassumptions\u2014the conceptualization of hormones as sexed\u2014to\nunderstandings of the world that are problematic including conclusions\nabout sexual desire, sexual orientation, and \u201csex-typed\u201d\ninterests and behaviors.\n",
