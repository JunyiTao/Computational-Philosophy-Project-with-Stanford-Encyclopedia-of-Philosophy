    "main_text": "Denying the assumption of structured-propositionalism\n8. Two further puzzles: Kripke\u2019s puzzles and Richard\u2019s puzzle\n\nWe have concluded our survey of the main accounts of propositional\nattitude reports and their problems. The discussion has focused on\nFrege\u2019s puzzle. In this section we shall briefly discuss further\npuzzles that any account of propositional attitude ascribing sentences\nmust deal with. The first is a pair of puzzles that Saul Kripke\nintroduced in his 1979 and the second is a puzzle Richard introduced\nin his 1983.\n\nIn his 1980 (originally presented as a series of lectures in 1970)\nSaul Kripke argued that the reference of a name is not determined by\nidentifying descriptions a speaker associates with the name but rather\nby real world connections between uses of names and objects. In so\narguing, Kripke, among others, paved the way for the now widely\n(although not universally) accepted direct reference theory of proper\nnames. He also ran flat into Frege\u2019s puzzle. In his 1980, Kripke\nclaims to not know what to say about Frege\u2019s puzzle and the\nrelated puzzle of cognitive significance, on the one hand, and the\nproblem of negative existentials and the related problem of empty\nnames, on the other. In John Locke lectures of 1973, now published as\nKripke 2013, delivered three years after his famous Naming and\nNecessity lectures, Kripke addressed the second set of problems;\nin his 1979, he addressed the first. He did not aim to solve\nFrege\u2019s puzzle. Instead, his aim was to show that his thesis of\nnames, which he admitted seems to entail that the substitution of\nco-referring proper names within the scope of attitude verbs is\nlegitimate, is not the true source of the trouble. Kripke argued that\nthe problems could be replicated without assuming Kripke\u2019s\nthesis about names, relying instead on translation principles and\ncontext-shifting principles. The problems driving Frege\u2019s\npuzzle, Kripke aimed to show, did not concern the semantics of proper\nnames. Frege\u2019s puzzle could thus not be used to disprove any\ntheory of the semantics of proper names. Kripke presented two sets of\ncases to convince us of this.\n\nThe first case involves a monolingual (French-speaking) Frenchman\n\u2013 Kripke names him \u2018Pierre\u2019 \u2013 who hears about\na city with the name \u2018Londres\u2019. Pierre forms a good\nopinion of the city based on what he hears of it (all in French) and\nis disposed to assent to (29) below.\n\n(29) Londres est jolie.\n\n\nPierre is competent and reflective, we can suppose, and so, by an\napplication of the Disquotation principle, we get (30) below.\n\n(30) Pierre croit que Londres est jolie.\n\n\nKripke then employs a translation principle, according to which a good\ntranslation of a sentence from one language into another preserves the\ntruth-value of the original. (31) below is a good English translation\nof (30).\n\n(31) Pierre believes that London is pretty.\n\n\nSo, like (30), (31) is also true. Suppose next that Pierre moves to a\nforeign land where he learns the native tongue by immersion; he\ndoesn\u2019t learn the translation of any of the words in his new\nlanguage into French. He is confined to a rather dreary party of the\ncity he lives in and comes to believe of it that it is not pretty. The\nforeign land, of course, is London and the language he learns is\nEnglish. He is soon disposed to assent to (32).\n\n(32) London is not pretty.\n\n\nWe can suppose that Pierre is as competent in English as any\nmonolingual English speaker. We are then justified in using\nDisquotation to derive (33) below.\n\n(33) Pierre believes that London is not pretty.\n\n\nWe can go further. Suppose that Pierre positively rejects (34)\nbelow.\n\n(34) London is pretty.\n\n\nThen, given Converse Disquotation, we get (35).\n\n(35) Pierre does not believe that London is pretty.\n\n\nWe can suppose that Pierre is all the while still disposed to assent\nto (29); Pierre has not, we can suppose, changed his mind about what\nhe believed about that foreign city he learned about in France under\nthe name \u2018Londres\u2019. So, intuitively, (31) is also still\ntrue.\n\nWe have the same set of contradictions we derived earlier in\n\u201cFrege\u2019s puzzle.\u201d Because both (31) and (33) are\ntrue of Pierre at the same time and they appear to involve attribution\nto Pierre of belief in a proposition and its negation, it would seem\nthat Pierre is irrational. Intuitively Pierre is free of irrationality\nin his beliefs. (31) and (35) seem to be, themselves, mutually\ninconsistent. Yet we derived them using the same basic principles\ndriving Frege\u2019s puzzle. Because we nowhere employed the thesis\nof direct reference nor a substitution principle seemingly entailed by\nthe thesis of direct reference, Kripke concludes that simply denying\nthe thesis of direct reference is not sufficient for solving the\noriginal Frege puzzle. After all, we get the very same set of problems\nwithout that thesis.\n\nThe puzzle of Pierre relies upon a translation principle. But, lest\none think that merely denying that translation principle suffices to\nsolve Kripke\u2019s puzzle, Kripke presents another version of the\npuzzle that does not involve translation across languages. This second\npuzzle has come to be known as \u201cthe Paderewski puzzle.\u201d\nSuppose that Peter has had interactions with a politician he knows\nunder the name \u2018Paderewski\u2019 and interactions with a\npianist he knows under the name \u2018Paderewski\u2019. Peter has no\nidea that Paderewski-the-politician is the same person as\nPaderewski-the-pianist; he thinks that they are two different people\nwho happen to have the same name, or at least names that are\npronounced the same. From this assumption, we can see that we could\nemploy Disquotation, Rationality, and Converse Disquotation to derive\na set of contradictions similar to those involving Lois and Pierre\ndescribed above.\n\nNotice that the puzzle here is not that of belief but that of belief\nattributions. So, for example, Taschek 1988 is quite right to observe\nthat, no doubt, Peter possesses two separate modes of presentation of\nPaderewski under which he believes of him what he does. But this\nobservation in itself does not solve Kripke\u2019s puzzle, especially\nif we think that the public language name \u2018Paderewski\u2019 is\nunivocal, at least when tied to the relevant Paderewski, and that\nPeter is speaking the public language. (Taschek offers solutions to\nKripke\u2019s puzzles in his 1997, 1998.) This is not to say that the\npuzzle is intractable \u2013 indeed, there have been many attempted\nsolutions to both of Kripke\u2019s puzzles. (See, for example, Bach\n1997, Bealer 1993, Crimmins 1992a, Crimmins and Perry 1989, Forbes\n1990, Lewis 1981, McKay 1981, Recanati 1993, Richard 1990, Salmon\n1995a, Sosa 1996.) Rather, it is to say that in order to tract it, one\nmust give an account of propositional attitude ascriptions.\nAny adequate account of propositional attitude ascriptions must\naccount for what is going on in Kripke-style cases. And, as we have\nseen above in our discussion of ILFs, Kripke\u2019s puzzles can be\nused to raise objections to certain proposals of attitude\nascriptions.\n\nIn his 1983, Mark Richard introduced us to a puzzle that seems to show\nthat apparent substitution-failure is not confined to failures inside\nthe scope of attitude verbs. Part of the interest in the case derives\nfrom the fact that it calls into question the idea that apparent\nsubstitution-failure intuitions can be explained by claiming that\npropositional attitude verbs create intensional contexts, being\nsensitive to more than just the ordinary referential content of terms\nwithin their scope. This is because Richard describes a case in which\nco-referential terms outside the attitude verb are intuitively not\nintersubstitutable. (Jennifer Saul presents very different cases\nintended to demonstrate the same point. See Braun and Saul 2002 and\nSaul 1997, 1999, 2007.) Whereas standard Frege cases exploit identity\nconfusions of the agent of the belief alone, Richard\u2019s cases\nexploit identity ignorances of the ascriber. Suppose that Sally is\ntalking to Bill on the phone when she looks out the window and sees a\nsteamroller heading towards an occupied phone booth. Sally\ndoesn\u2019t realize that the person in the phone booth is Bill. So,\nSally is disposed to accept (36) but reject (37), despite their having\nthe same referential content.\n\n(36) He [pointing out her window at the person in the phone booth] is\nin danger.\n\n\n(37) You [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\nOn the basis of this acceptance patterns, using the principles\ngenerating Frege\u2019s puzzle, it would seem that the following are\ntrue as uttered by Sally.\n\n(38) I believe that he [pointing out her window at the person in the\nphone booth] is in danger.\n\n\n(39) I do not believe that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in\ndanger.\n\n\nSo far, nothing too surprising; so far, that is, we just have a\nclassic Frege-style case. But let\u2019s continue the story. Sally\ntries to catch the attention of the person in the phone booth to warn\nhim of the impending danger. She leans out of her window and waves her\narms madly, screaming at the top of her lungs. Bill sees someone\nwaving and yelling at him, comes to believe that that person believes\nof him that he is in danger (although, as he quickly looks around, not\nseeing the steamroller, can\u2019t imagine why), but doesn\u2019t\nrealize that it is Sally waving her arms. He says to Sally over the\nphone, \u201cThere\u2019s someone waving at me and she believes that\nI am in danger.\u201d Sally believes what Bill says and so is\ndisposed to accept (40) below.\n\n(40) The person waving at you [addressing Bill on the phone] believes\nthat you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Bill and Sally, Sally is the person waving at Bill. The\nthat-clauses in (39) and (40) are the same. Their difference resides\nin the different terms designating Sally, both of which occur outside\nthe scope of \u2018believes\u2019. Even if we accept that\nco-designating terms are not intersubstitutable inside the scope of\npropositional attitude verbs, surely they are outside the scope of an\nattitude verb. So (40), together with the fact that Sally is the\nperson waving at Bill, entails that (41) is true as spoken by\nSally.\n\n(41) I believe that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in danger.\n\n\n(39) and (41) are mutually inconsistent. Furthermore, the truth of\n(41) seems out of keeping with the idea that what a person believes\nand what she does not believe is revealed by her sincere, competent,\nand reflective acceptance patterns, as we have already seen that Sally\ndoes not accept and indeed rejects (37). And as this idea is a driving\nforce behind Frege\u2019s puzzle, those who take Frege\u2019s puzzle\nto raise problems for Naive Russellianism cannot simply respond to\nRichard\u2019s puzzle by claiming that (39) is false.\n\nIn 1983, Richard took this case to show that our apparent\nsubstitution-failure intuitions should be explained pragmatically and\nnot semantically. Otherwise, he thought, we have substitution-failures\noutside the scope of attitude verbs, which is evidently unacceptable.\nWhile (39) may seem true and (41) may seem false, this is because we\nconflate what an utterance of these sentences pragmatically\nimplicates, suggesting that Sally would accept the complement clause\nused to report what she believes. This same explanation, Richard\ninsists, should be employed in both Frege\u2019s and Kripke\u2019s\npuzzles, leading us to Naive Russellianism.\n\nIn their 1989, Crimmins and Perry respond to Richard\u2019s challenge\nby accepting that there are substitution-failures even outside the\nscope of attitude verbs. But, they claim, such failures are limited to\nself-attributions like (41), because of what they call \u201cthe\npragmatic principle of self-ascription...an utterance of \u2018I\nbelieve that \u2026t\u2026\u2019 provides (or, is about)\nthe notion that is connected to the speaker\u2019s use of\n\u2018t\u2019.\u201d (p. 708). This response assumes that\nRichard-style cases require the first-person pronoun. But that\nassumption is false. All one needs to construct a Richard-style case\nis for the ascribers to be ignorant of the identities of the\nagents they are ascribing beliefs to. (Recall the cases of conflicting\nrestrictions described above.) One can then use nothing but\nthird-person means of designating the alleged believers and get the\nsame intuitive variation in truth-values. Crimmins and Perry\u2019s\nhope that such substitution-failures will be confined to cases\ninvolving the first-person pronoun is ill-founded. Hence, if one is\nsimply going to accept the consequence that there are substitution\nfailures even outside the scope of the attitude verb, then one will\nhave to accept that consequence in an unrestricted form. \n\nRichard no longer believes that his case supports the claim that\napparent substitution-failures are best explained pragmatically. In\nhis 1990, Richard claims that the appearance of a contradiction turns\non context-shifts. Suppose that Benny says, \u201cI am hungry,\u201d\nand Paula says, \u201cI am not hungry.\u201d Anyone who attempted to\nclaim that they can\u2019t both be speaking truly would be guilty of\nshifting the context in her attempt to derive a contradiction. Paula\ndoes not deny what Benny says, but instead says something about\nherself. The context-shift is obvious in this case, as it is obvious\nthat \u2018I\u2019 is context-sensitive. The context-shift is less\nobvious, and hence more pernicious, claims Richard, in the case of\npropositional attitude verbs. Richard claims that when we judge (41)\nto be false, we are evaluating it relative to a context c\nsuch that, were we to evaluate (39) relative to c as well, we\nwould see that it too is false. (In short, we are evaluating it in a\ncontext in which the operative restrictions on correlation functions\nare such that \u2018that you [addressing Bill on the phone] are in\ndanger\u2019 is not mapped on to anything that Sally accepts.) When,\non the other hand, we judge that (39) is true, we are evaluating it\nrelative to a context c\u2032 such that, were we to evaluate\n(41) relative to c\u2032 as well, we would see that it too\nis true. So, claims Richard, our intuitions turn on shifting the\ncontext. If we focus on any single context, we see that there are no\nsubstitution failures outside the scope of attitude verbs.\n\nRichard offers a similar solution to Kripke\u2019s puzzle. In\nKripke-style cases, the attributor is conscious of the\nmisidentification, and so it is plausible to claim that there is a\ncontext-shift. (Insofar as we grant that something like restrictions\non correlation functions are part of context, that is.) The speaker is\nconscious of the fact that her uses of \u2018London\u2019 in\nrepresenting Pierre\u2019s beliefs are not completely univocal, as\nshe first uses them to represent his \u201cLondres\u201d-beliefs and\nthen to represent his \u201cLondon\u201d-beliefs. But in\nRichard\u2019s case, the speaker need not be conscious of the\nmisidentification and hence will not recognize any shift in the\ncontext. She will take her utterances of (39) and (41) to be part of a\nsingle communicative exchange in which no context shifts have been\nneeded, precisely because she (that is, Sally) takes (39) to concern\none person\u2019s beliefs and (41) to concern another person\u2019s\nbeliefs. So, there are reasons to think that our intuitions concerning\nthe truth and falsity of (39) and (41) do not rely on implicit\ncontext-shifting.\n\nKripke\u2019s puzzles of Pierre and Paderewski and Richard\u2019s\npuzzle, like Frege\u2019s puzzle, provide more data that any adequate\naccount of attitude ascribing sentences must accommodate. Ultimately,\nany such account must fit with a broader theory of human interaction.\nPeople communicate their beliefs, they agree when they share a belief,\nand beliefs play a role in motivating and explaining action. Any\naccount of belief attributions must say how proposition attitude\nascribing sentences contribute to all of this, and the account must\ndividing the contribution into its semantic and pragmatic aspects.\n",
