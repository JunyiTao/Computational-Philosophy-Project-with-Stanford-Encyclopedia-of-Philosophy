    "main_text": "Informal Logic Within A Broader Context\n6. Informal Logic and Philosophy\n\nThe field of informal logic is a recent invention, but one that\ncontinues historical attempts to understand and teach others how to\nargue. In the Western philosophical tradition, it begins with the\nsophists\u2019 fifth century boast that they could teach others how\nto be successful arguers. In Aristotle it is manifest in his\nsystematic account of reasoning, which is expressly designed to teach\nothers how to argue well. Within the history of philosophy, one finds\nnumerous other attempts to formulate accounts of argument that can be\nused to explain, evaluate, and teach real life reasoning. \n\nThe practice of philosophy itself assumes (and frequently develops) an\naccount of argument as it assembles evidence for different\nphilosophical perspectives. Systems of informal logic assume, and\noften depend upon, the resulting views of reason, rationality and what\ncounts as evidence and knowledge. The philosophical issues in play are\ntied to complex, unsettled epistemological questions about evidence\nand knowledge. \n\nMercier and Sperber (2011) argue that reasoning is a practice which\nhas evolved from, and needs to be understood in terms of, the social\npractice of argumentation. Johnson 2000 pushes in the opposite\ndirection, arguing that a comprehensive account of argument must be\nbuilt upon a philosophical account of rationality. Goldman 1999\nsituates knowledge in the social interactions that take place within\ninterpersonal exchange and knowledge institutions, emphasizing\ninformal argument and the constraints which make it a valuable\npractice. A 2002 volume of Philosophica on Hilary\nPutnam\u2019s philosophy suggests pragmatism as an epistemology that\nbest fits informal logic as a discipline. \n\nSome aspects of informal logic raise deep questions that have\nimplications for logic and philosophy. One notable feature of informal\nlogic as it is now practiced is a proliferation of different systems\nof informal logic which approach the analysis and evaluation of\ninformal reasoning in different ways \u2014 employing fallacies,\nAV criteria, argumentation schemes, methods of formal analysis,\nand other models of good argument. One implication is a broadening of\nthe conditions for argument felicity. \n\nOther issues are raised by informal logic\u2019s recognition that\nreal life arguments frequently employ visual images, non-verbal\nsounds, and other non-verbal elements, challenging the traditional\nassumption that arguments are sets of sentences -- or the propositions\n(\u201cthe bearers of truth value\u201d) that sentences refer to.\nHowever one understands visual and multimodal arguments, there is no\neasy way to reduce them to sets of sentences, for there is no precise\nway to translate what we see, hear, experience, etc. into words. \n\nIn its current state of development, informal logic\u2019s connection\nto philosophy does not lie in its influence on key philosophical\ndisciplines so much as their influence on it. In North America and\nelsewhere, informal logic is a field in which philosophers apply\ntheories of argument (rationality, knowledge, etc.) to everyday\nargument. In keeping with this, philosophers continue to be the core\ncontributors to informal logic; philosophy departments in colleges and\nuniversities continue to be the core departments that teach the\ncourses that are its pedagogical focus. \n\nThe influence of informal logic courses on the enormous numbers of\nstudents that enrol in them require that we at least qualify\nRescher\u2019s remark (2005, p. 22) that: \u201cThe fact is that\nphilosophy has little or no place in American popular (as opposed to\nacademic) culture... philosophy nowadays makes virtually no impact on\nthe wider culture of North America.\u201d The extent to which\ninformal logic\u2019s attempt to broadly instill good reasoning\nhabits within public education and public discussion and debate is\ndifficult to judge. \n\nThough informal logic addresses many issues relevant to core\nphilosophical disciplines (most notably, epistemology and philosophy\nof mind; evident in the work of Goldman, Crosswhite, Thagard, and\nothers), it has had limited impact on mainstream approaches to their\nsubject matter. Woods 2000 has speculated on the reasons why. In part,\ninformal logic\u2019s position within philosophy reflects the broader\nfragmentation of philosophy within North America, Rescher 2005 (p. 4)\nwriting that: \u201cThe most striking aspect of contemporary American\nphilosophy is its fragmentation. The scale and complexity of the\nenterprise is such that if one seeks in contemporary American\nphilosophy for a consensus on the problem agenda, let alone for\nagreement on the substantive issues, then one is predestined to look\nin vain.\u201d \n\nIn this context, it can best be said that informal logic, like applied\nethics, has become a standard offering that helps sustain philosophy\ndepartments in North America by contributing to what Rescher describes\nas \u201cThe rapid growth of \u2018applied philosophy\u2019\n...[that] is a striking structural feature of contemporary North\nAmerican philosophy.\u201d (p. 9). The goal of applied philosophy is\nphilosophically informed and nuanced reasoning that addresses complex\nreal life situations. Informal logic is one field which has made a\nvaluable contribution to this goal.\n",
