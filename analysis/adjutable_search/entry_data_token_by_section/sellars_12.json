    "main_text": "Practical Reason:  Intentions, Rules, and Normativity || Rules and Normativity\n8. The Stereoscopic Vision\nSellars thinks that science\u2019s aperspectival description of\nthe empirical world is the measure of reality, but he is also\ncommitted to the indispensability of the concepts built into the\nfirst-person perspective that makes agency possible.  If those\nconcepts were not involved in the regulation of our behavior, we would\nnot be persons and could not engage in such activities as moral\nbehavior or scientific research.  This is why Sellars calls for\na stereoscopic vision in which the descriptive resources of the\nsciences are united with the language of individual and community\nintentions and the dualism of the manifest and scientific images is\ntranscended.  \nSellars possessed a broad vision, but did not shy away from detail\nwork.  He was a \u201cphilosopher\u2019s philosopher;\u201d his\nessays are complex and difficult pieces, challenging but rewarding to\nmaster.  Beginning in 1994 with Sellars-inspired publications by his erstwhile colleagues John\nMcDowell and Robert B. Brandom, interest in Sellars\u2019 work has increased steadily, both in the U. S. and abroad.  Publications and conferences focused on or inspired by Sellars are now common.  In\n2015, for instance, significant conferences devoted to Sellars were\nheld in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.  The literature on Sellars has grown appreciably since the last revision of this article.  Sellars\u2019s\nphilosophy is rich enough to provide a framework within which\notherwise distinct philosophical tendencies can find sufficient common\nground to engage each other fruitfully.  Sellars\nstudies has been dominated by a clash between the \u201cright-wing\nSellarsians\u201d (e.g., Patricia and Paul Churchland, Ruth Millikan, Jay\nRosenberg), who emphasize Sellars\u2019s scientific realism and\nnominalism, and the \u201cleft-wing Sellarsians\u201d (e.g., Rorty,\nMcDowell, and Brandom), who emphasize instead Sellars\u2019s\ninsistence on the irreducibility and sociality of rules and norms. Sellars\u2019s expressivism has garnered increasing attention in both camps. Lately, a younger generation has begun constructing a finer-grained story of Sellars\u2019s development.  This will likely enable a better articulation of the structure of Sellars\u2019s philosophy and, perhaps, a new sense of its potential.\n",
