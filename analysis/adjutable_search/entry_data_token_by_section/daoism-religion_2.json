    "main_text": "Early Daoist Texts || Zhuangzi\n1.2 Zhuangzi\n\nZhuangzi\u2014whose name was Zhuang Zhou\u2014probably lived between\n370 and 280 BCE. He wrote the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d (1\u20137)\nof the eponymous work, which form the first of its three main parts.\nThe two other parts, namely the \u201cOuter Chapters\u201d\n(8\u201322) and the \u201cMiscellaneous Chapters\u201d\n(23\u201333), contain writings by different groups of authors. (For\noverviews of the Zhuangzi, its textual layers, and its\ncommentaries, see Graham 1989: 170\u2013211; Mair 2000; and Roth\n2014.)\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s view of the Dao is in agreement with Laozi\u2019s\nview: \n\n\nThe Way has its reality and its signs but is without action or form.\nYou can hand it down but you cannot receive it; you can get it but you\ncannot see it. It is its own source, its own root. Before Heaven and\nEarth existed it was there, firm from ancient times. (ch. 6; trans.\nWatson 1968: 81) \n\n\nHowever, Zhuangzi repeatedly brings forth the issue of whether and how\nthe Dao can be known. As the Dao is the absolute, it cannot be made an\nobject; therefore its knowledge cannot be attained by the ordinary\nmind, which functions by establishing distinctions between \u201cself\nand other\u201d, \u201cthis and that\u201d, \u201cright and\nwrong\u201d, and other relative concepts (ch. 2; Watson,\n36\u201349). Zhuangzi\u2019s analysis of the human mind is in fact\nan epistemology: since the Dao is ultimately unknowable through the\nordinary mind, there is only one way to know it: through \u201cthe\nknowledge that does not know\u201d (ch. 4; Watson, 58).\n\nThe human ideal of Zhuangzi reflects this view: \n\n\nThe True Man (or realized person, zhenren) of ancient times\ndid not rebel against want, did not grow proud in plenty, and did not\nplan his affairs \u2026 [He] was able to climb all the way up to the\nWay \u2026 [He] knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating\ndeath. (ch. 6; Watson, 77\u201378) \n\n\nIn the Zhuangzi, the theme of \u201cinner freedom\u201d\nreceives more emphasis compared to the Daode jing: freedom\nfrom social rules, from ingrained patterns of thought, from\n\u201cessentialism\u201d (the belief that things have permanent\ncharacteristics that make them what they are), and from conventional\n\u201cself-identity\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201cInner Chapters\u201d, the refusal to elevate ethics to\na primary principle follows the views of the Daode jing: \n\n\nThe way I see it, the rules of benevolence and righteousness and the\npaths of right and wrong are all hopelessly snarled and jumbled. (ch.\n2; Watson, 45\u201346) \n\n\nIn agreement with this view, Zhuangzi is disillusioned about the\npossibility of using ordinary ethical virtues as a basis for politics\nand government: \n\n\nTo try to govern the world like this is like trying to walk the ocean,\nto drill through a river, or to make a mosquito shoulder a mountain!\n(ch. 7; Watson, 93; see also 66\u201367) \n\n\nFor Zhuangzi, the enlightened ruler is the one whose achievements\n\u201cappear not to be his own doing\u201d. Thus \u201cthe people\ndo not depend on him \u2026 [and] he lets everything find its own\nenjoyment\u201d (ch. 7; Watson, 94). The speaker of this passage is\nLaozi himself, whose views on \u201cnon-doing\u201d in government\nare accepted by Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Zhuangzi began to have a noticeable influence on the\nlater Daoist tradition from the 4th century CE, when it\nbecame one of the sources of inspiration for the Shangqing (Highest\nClarity) school of Daoism (see\n \u00a73.3).\n Since then, this work has contributed an impressive number of ideas,\nconcepts, and terms to later Daoist works (Robinet 1983). These\ninclude the \u201cfasting of the mind\u201d (xinzhai; ch.\n4; Watson, 54\u201358) and the \u201csitting and forgetting\u201d\n(zuowang; ch. 6; Watson, 90\u201391), two expressions that\nin later Daoism denote methods of self-cultivation, but in the\nZhuangzi describe the inner state of the realized person.\n(For the view that they refer to actual practices also in the\nZhuangzi, see Roth 1997.)\n",
