    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nWe know relatively little about the life of Fran\u00e7ois Poulain\n(or Poullain) de la Barre. No correspondence or accounts by his\ncontemporaries have survived. What we know has to be reconstructed\nfrom occasional surviving official documents and from supposedly\nautobiographical remarks in his writings. Accounts of Poulain\u2019s\nlife rely on archival research done in particular by Marie-Louise\nStock (1961), Madeleine Alcover (1981), and Siep Stuurman (2004).\n\nPoulain was born in Paris in 1648, as the third child to wealthy\nCatholic parents. As many younger sons he was destined for a church\ncareer and he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in theology at\nSorbonne in 1666. This lower degree was generally considered\nsufficient for priesthood, but Poulain did not at this point of his\nlife seek to be ordained and this decision, though temporary, is often\nconnected with his growing interest in Cartesian philosophy (Stuurman\n2004: 30). In his second main work De l\u2019\u00e9ducation des\ndames [On the Education of Ladies] (1674), a set of five\nconversations between a Cartesian teacher, a young man and two young\nwomen, Poulain describes how the teacher Stasimachus became a follower\nof Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 philosophy. Stasimachus tells his\nyoung interlocutors how, one day, when he found \n\n\nall the sciences of the Schools particularly distasteful, by a great\nstroke of luck I allowed myself to be taken off by a friend to hear a\nCartesian lecturing on a subject concerning the human body. (TTen 245;\nTTfr 281) \n\n\nFed on Scholastic prejudices against Cartesian philosophy, Stasimachus\nwas initially suspicious and then \n\n\nastonished to hear nothing but what was clear and intelligible, to\nrealize that [the speaker] was reasoning on the basis of principles\nthat were so simple and so true that I could not fail to agree with\nthem. (TTen 245; TTfr 281\u2013282) \n\n\nAs Stuurman points out, this description is a \u201cstreamlined\nconversion story\u201d, of a type often repeated by followers of\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy during the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury (Stuurman 2004: 35). Stasimachus\u2019 conversion must not be\nread as Poulain\u2019s autobiography, but we have strong grounds to\nassume that Poulain became interested in Cartesian philosophy while\nstill a student and that his interest was connected to attending\npublic lectures, such as those held in Paris by the Cartesian Jacques\nRohault (Stuurman 2004: 43).\n\nScholars also agree that after leaving university, Poulain was\nteaching literature and a textbook on translating Latin into French,\npublished anonymously in 1672, has been attributed to him (Stock 1961:\n19\u201320; Welch 2002a: 9). In the following year he published\nDe l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des deux sexes [On the\nEquality of the Two Sexes] (1673), the first and most widely known of\nhis three feminist treatises. One year later it was followed by De\nl\u2019\u00e9ducation des dames and in the next year by De\nl\u2019excellence des hommes, contre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9\ndes sexes [On the Excellence of Men, against the Equality of the\nSexes] (1675). Despite its name the third treatise continues\nPoulain\u2019s defense of equality between the sexes by overturning\nhis rhetorically presented arguments on the behalf of the excellence\nof men. This treatise is less Cartesian than the two earlier ones and\nmore engaged with theological arguments. In this respect it resembles\nearlier treatises participating in the Renaissance querelle des\nfemmes, the debate about the superiority of women versus men,\nsuch as Cornelius Agrippa\u2019s De nobilitate et praecellentia\nfoeminei sexus [On the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female\nSex] (1509/1529).\n\nAt some point after publishing his three feminist treatises, Poulain\nreturned to theology and he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1679.\nHis decision to take up a church career after having written treatises\nheavily critical of Scholastic philosophy might seem odd. There is no\ndoubt that Poulain used Cartesian arguments as a basis for his\nfeminist claims and that he was critical of Scholasticism, but we must\nalso note that his third treatise is in many respect a reconciliation\nbetween his feminism and theology. When reconstructing Poulain\u2019s\nopinions we must be careful not to identify him too closely with the\ncharacter Stasimachus. As Carol Pal has argued in the case of the\nfriendship between Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, with strong\nCartesian sympathies, and Anna Maria van Schurman, who was in many\nrespects a Scholastic thinker, it was not unusual that\nseventeenth-century intellectuals combined elements from the old and\nthe new philosophy (Pal 2012: 250\u2013254). It is quite possible\nthat Poulain was less militant a convert to Cartesianism than his\ncharacter Stasimachus.\n\nAfter being ordained Poulain served as a curate in two parishes in\nPicardy, first in the medium-sized village La Flamengrie, from where\nhe was transferred to the small village Versigny in 1685, possibly as\nthe result of some disciplinary measure (Stuurman 2004:\n239\u2013240). In Picardy Poulain witnessed the persecution of\nProtestants and this is often interpreted as paving the way for his\nown conversion from Catholicism to Calvinism. He left his parish in\n1688 and after a short stay in Paris, where his conversion is assumed\nto have taken place, he moved to Geneva, where he received the status\nof habitant in December 1689 (Stuurman 2004: 242\u2013243).\nAs a resident of Geneva, Poulain continued his earlier career teaching\nFrench and in 1690 he married Marie Ravier (d. 1742), with whom he had\ntwo children, Jean-Charlotte (1690\u20131716) and Jean-Jacques\n(1696\u20131751), a future Calvinist minister and follower of many of\nhis father\u2019s theological ideas (Welch 2002a: 17\u201320;\nStuurman 2004: 245\u2013246). Poulain published two more books,\nEssai des remarques particuli\u00e8res sur la langue\nfran\u00e7oise pour la ville de Gen\u00e8ve [An Essay of\ndetailed comments about the French language, for the city of Geneva]\n(1691), related to his career as a teacher, and La Doctrine des\nProtestans sur la libert\u00e9 et le droit de lire l\u2019Ecriture\nSainte, etc. [Protestant Teaching about the Freedom and the Right\nto Read the Holy Scriptures, etc.] (1720), developing his mature\ntheological opinions. He did earn a secure living in his chosen\nhomeland, though he did not find the religious freedom he appears to\nhave been hoping for. In 1693, and again in 1696, Poulain was accused\nfor being a Socinian, an accusation that was related to his\nrationalistic approach to theology, which did not draw a strict\ndistinction between theology and philosophy (Stuurman 2004:\n248\u2013249). This affair has been seen as the main reason why\nPoulain had to wait until 1708 before he was appointed to a permanent\nteaching position at the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve, a position\nthat he held until his death in 1723.\n",
