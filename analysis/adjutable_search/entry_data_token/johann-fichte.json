Life and Work\n\nFichte was born May 19, 1762 in the village of Rammenau in the\nOberlausitz area of Saxony. He was the eldest son in a family of poor\nand pious ribbon weavers. His extraordinary intellectual talent soon\nbrought him to the attention of a local baron, who sponsored his\neducation, first in the home of a local pastor, then at the famous\nPforta boarding school, and finally at the universities of Jena and\nLeipzig. With the death of his patron, Fichte was forced to\ndiscontinue his studies and seek his livelihood as a private tutor, a\nprofession he quickly came to detest.\n\nFollowing a lengthy sojourn in Zurich, were he met his future wife,\nJohanna Rahn, Fichte returned to Leipzig with the intention of\npursuing a literary career. When his projects failed, he was again\nforced to survive as a tutor. It was in this capacity that he began\ngiving lessons on the Kantian philosophy in the summer of 1790. This\nfirst encounter with Kant\u2019s writings produced what Fichte\nhimself described as a \u201crevolution\u201d in his manner of\nthinking. Whereas he had formally been torn between, on the one hand,\na practical commitment to the moral improvement of humanity and, on\nthe other, a theoretical commitment to \u201cintelligible\nfatalism,\u201d he found in the Critical philosophy a way of\nreconciling his \u201chead\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d in a system\nthat could meet the highest intellectual standards without requiring\nhim to sacrifice his belief in human freedom.\n\nFichte eventually made his way to K\u00f6nigsberg, where he lived for\na few months. After a disappointing interview with Kant, he resolved\nto demonstrate his mastery of the latter\u2019s philosophy by writing\na treatise on a theme as yet unaddressed by Kant: namely, the question\nof the compatibility of the Critical philosophy with any concept of\ndivine revelation. In a few weeks Fichte composed a remarkable\nmanuscript in which he concluded that the only revelation consistent\nwith the Critical philosophy is the moral law itself. Kant was\nsufficiently impressed by the talent of this unknown and impoverished\nyoung man to offer to arrange for the publication of Fichte\u2019s\nmanuscript, which was published by Kant\u2019s own publisher in 1792\nunder the title Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation. The\nfirst edition of this work, however, for reasons that have never been\nsatisfactorily explained, appeared without the author\u2019s name and\npreface and was quickly and widely hailed as a work by Kant himself.\nWhen the true identity of its author was revealed, Fichte was\nimmediately catapulted from total obscurity to philosophical\ncelebrity.\n\nMeanwhile, Fichte was once again employed as a private tutor, this\ntime on an estate near Danzig, where he wrote several, anonymously\npublished political tracts. The first of these was published in 1793\nwith the provocative title Reclamation of the Freedom of Thought\nfrom the Princes of Europe, who have hitherto Suppressed it. In\nthe summer of 1793 Fichte returned to Zurich where he married his\nfianc\u00e9 and oversaw the publication of the first two\ninstallments of his spirited Contribution to the Rectification of\nthe Public\u2019s Judgment of the French Revolution (1793 and\n1794). In this work he not only defended the principles (if not all\nthe practices) of the French revolutionaries, but also attempted to\noutline his own democratic view of legitimate state authority and\ninsisted on the right of revolution. Despite the fact that these\npolitical writings were published anonymously, the author\u2019s\nidentity was widely known, and Fichte thereby acquired a reputation,\nnot wholly deserved, as a radical \u201cJacobin.\u201d\n\nFollowing the completion of these projects, Fichte devoted his time in\nZurich to rethinking and revising his own philosophical position.\nWhile maintaining his allegiance to the new Critical or Kantian\nphilosophy, Fichte was powerfully impressed by the efforts of K. L.\nReinhold to provide the Critical philosophy with a new, more secure\n\u201cfoundation\u201d and to base the entire system upon a single\n\u201cfirst principle.\u201d At the same time, he became acquainted\nwith the works of two authors who were engaged in skeptical attacks\nupon the philosophies of both Kant and Reinhold: Solomon Maimon and G.\nE. Schulze (\u201cAenesidemus\u201d). It was the need to respond to\nthe sharp criticisms of these authors that eventually led Fichte to\nconstruct his own, unique version of transcendental idealism, for\nwhich, in the spring of 1794, he eventually coined the name\nWissenschaftslehre (\u201cDoctrine of Science\u201d or\n\u201cTheory of Scientific Knowledge\u201d). During the winter of\n1793/94 he composed a long manuscript, \u201cPrivate Mediations on\nElementary Philosophy/Pracical Philosophy,\u201d in which worked out\nsome of the fundamental features of his new system. In Feburary and\nMarch of 1794 he gave a series of private lectures on his conception\nof philosophy before a small circle of influential clerics and\nintellectuals in Zurich.\n\nIt was at this moment that he received an invitation to assume the\nrecently vacated chair of Critical Philosophy at the University of\nJena, which was rapidly emerging as the capital of the new German\nphilosophy. Fichte arrived in Jena in May of 1794, and enjoyed\ntremendous popular success there for the next six years, during which\ntime he laid the foundations and developed the first systematic\narticulations of his new system. Even as he was engaged in this\nimmense theoretical labor, he also tried to address a larger, popular\naudience and also threw himself into various practical efforts to\nreform university life. As one bemused colleague observed, \u201chis\nis a restless spirit; he thirsts for some opportunity to act in the\nworld. Fichte wants to employ his philosophy to guide the spirit of\nhis age.\u201d Indeed, a passionate desire to \u201chave an\neffect\u201d upon his own age remained a central feature of\nFichte\u2019s character, most notably expressed a decade later in his\ncelebrated Addresses to the German Nation, delivered in\nBerlin in 1806 during the French occupation. In Jena, this same desire\nis reflected in the enormously popular series of public lectures on\n\u201cMorality for Scholars,\u201d which he began to deliver\nimmediately upon his arrival in Jena. The first five of these lectures\nwere published in 1794 under the title Some Lectures concerning\nthe Scholar\u2019s Vocation.\n\nThough Fichte has already hinted at his new philosophical position in\nhis 1794 review of G. E. Schulze\u2019s Aenesidemus, the\nfirst full-scale public announcement of the same came in a short\nmanifesto that he published as a means of introducing himself to his\nnew students and colleagues at Jena and attracting listeners to his\nlectures. (As an \u201cextraordinary professor,\u201d Fichte was\nlargely dependent upon fees paid by students attending his\n\u201cprivate\u201d lectures.) This manifesto, Concerning the\nConcept of the Wissenschaftslehre (1794), articulated some of the\nbasic ideas of the new philosophy, but it mainly focused upon\nquestions of systematic form and the relationship between philosophy\nand its proper object (the necessary actions of the human mind).\n\nFichte\u2019s first truly systematic work was his Foundation of\nthe Entire Wissenschaftslehre (1794/95). As the title implies,\nthis work, which remains to this day Fichte\u2019s best-known\nphilosophical treatise, was not meant to be a presentation of his\nentire system, but only of the rudiments or first principles of the\nsame. In fact, Fichte had not originally intended to publish this work\nat all, which was written less than a year after his first tentative\nefforts to articulate for himself his new conception of transcendental\nphilosophy. The Foundation was originally intended to be\ndistributed, in fascicles, to students attending his private lectures\nduring his first two semesters at Jena, where the printed sheets could\nbe subjected to analysis and questions and supplemented with oral\nexplanations. Because of the great interest in Fichte\u2019s new\nphilosophy, however, he soon authorized a public edition of the same,\nin two volumes. Parts I and II of the Foundation were\npublished in 1794 and Part II in 1795. In 1795 he also published a\nsubstantial supplement to the Foundation, under the title\nOutline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre\nwith Respect to the Theoretical Faculty. The title pages of all\nthree of these publications, however, still stipulated that they were\nintended only as \u201ca manuscript for the use of his\nlisteners.\u201d (When, in 1802, Fichte issued a second, one-volume\nedition of the Foundation and Outline, in 1801, this\nsubtitle was dropped.)\n\nDissatisfied with many features of his initial presentation of the\n\u201cfoundational\u201d portion of his system and shocked by the\nvirtually universal misunderstanding of his published\nFoundation, Fichte immediately set to work on an entirely new\nexposition of the same, which he repeated three times in his private\nlectures on \u201cThe Foundations of Transcendental Philosophy\n(Wissenschaftslehre) nova methodo\u201d (1796/76, 1797/98,\n1798/99). Though he intended to revise these lectures for serial\npublication under the title An Attempt a New Presentation of the\nWissenschaftslehre in the Philosophisches Journal einer\nGesellschaft Teutscher Gelehrten, of which he himself was by then\nco-editor, only the two Introductions to and the first chapter of this\n\u201cNew Presentation\u201d ever appeared (1797/98).\n\nEven as he was thoroughly revising his presentation of the\nfoundational portion of his system, Fichte was simultaneously engaged\nin elaborating the various subdivisions or systematic branches of the\nsame. As was his custom, he did this first in his private lectures and\nthen in published texts based upon the same. The first such extension\nwas into the realm of philosophy of law and social philosophy, which\nresulted in the publication Foundations of Natural Right in\naccordance with the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre\n(published in two volumes in 1796 and 1797). The second extension was\ninto the realm of moral philosophy, which resulted in the publication\nof the System of Ethics in accordance with the Principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre (1798). Fichte then planned to extend his\nsystem into the realm of philosophy of religion. Indeed, he announced\nlectures on this topic for the Spring Semester of 1799, but before he\ncould commence these lectures, his career at Jena had come to an\nabrupt and unhappy conclusion in the wake of the so-called\n\u201cAtheism Controversy\u201d of 1798/99.\n\nIn 1798 Fichte published in his Philosophical Journal a brief\nessay \u201cOn the Basis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the\nWorld,\u201d in which he attempted to sketch some of his preliminary\nideas on the topic indicated in the title and simultaneously to give\nthe first clear public hint of the character of a philosophy of\nreligion \u201cin accordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre.\u201d The occasion for this essay was\nanother essay, published in the same issue of the Philosophical\nJournal, by K. L. Forberg. As it happened, these two essays\nprovoked an anonymous author to publish a pamphlet charging the\nauthors of both essays with atheism and demanding Fichte\u2019s\ndismissal from his post at Jena. The matter quickly escalated into a\nmajor public controversy which eventually led to the official\nsuppression of the offending issue of the journal and to public\nthreats by various German princes to prevent their students from\nenrolling at the University of Jena. The crisis produced by these\nactions and the growing number of publications for and against\nFichte\u2014which included an intemperate Appeal to the\nPublic by Fichte himself (1799), as well as a more thoughtful\nresponse entitled \u201cFrom a Private Letter\u201d\n(1799)\u2014eventually provoked F. H. Jacobi to publish his famous\n\u201copen letter\u201d to Fichte, in which he equated philosophy in\ngeneral and Fichte\u2019s transcendental philosophy in particular\nwith \u201cnihilism.\u201d As the public controversy unfolded,\nFichte badly miscalculated his own position and was finally forced to\nresign his position at Jena and to flee to Berlin, where he arrived in\nthe summer of 1799.\n\nAt this point, the Prussian capital had no university of its own, and\nFichte was forced to support himself by giving private tutorials and\nlectures on the Wissenschaftslehre and by a new flurry of\nliterary production, increasingly aimed at a large, popular audience.\nThe first of these \u201cpopular\u201d writings was a brilliant\npresentation of some of the characteristic doctrines and conclusions\nof Fichte\u2019s system, with a strong emphasis upon the moral and\nreligious character of the same. This work, The Vocation of\nMan (1800), which is perhaps Fichte\u2019s greatest literary\nachievements, was intended as an indirect response to Jacobi\u2019s\npublic repudiation of the Wissenschaftslehre. That same year\nalso saw the publication of a typically bold foray into political\neconomy, The Closed Commercial State, in which Fichte\npropounds a curious blend of socialist political ideas and autarkic\neconomic principles. Defending his philosophy against misunderstanding\nremained, however, Fichte\u2019s chief concern during this period, as\nis evidenced by the more direct response to Jacobi contained in his\npoignantly titled Sun-Clear Report to the Public at Large\nconcerning the Actual Character of the latest Philosophy: An Attempt\nto Force the Reader to Understand (1801).\n\nAt the same time that he was addressing the public in this manner,\nFichte was becoming ever more deeply engrossed in efforts to rethink\nand to rearticulate the very foundations of his system, beginning with\nhis private lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre of 1801/2, and\nculminating in the three, radically new versions of the same produced\nduring the year 1804. Indeed, he continued to produce new versions of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre right up until his death, delivering\nnew versions of his system in 1805, 1807, 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, and\n1814 (though the last two versions were cut short, the first by the\nwar with France and the second by Fichte\u2019s death). However, with\nthe single exception of the extraordinarily condensed (and\nextraordinarily opaque) Presentation of the General Outlines of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre (1810), none of these later versions of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre was published during Fichte\u2019s\nlifetime. Some of them appeared, in severely edited form, in the\ncollection of Fichte\u2019s Works published by his son\nseveral decades following his death, but most of them are only now\nbeing published for the first time in the critical edition of\nFichte\u2019s writings produced by the Bavarian Academy of the\nSciences. It appears that Fichte was so discouraged by the public\nreception of the first, 1794/95 presentation of the foundation of his\nsystem that he concluded that it was prudent to limit future new\npresentations of the same to the lecture hall and seminar room, where\nhe could elicit reactions and objections from his listeners and\nrespond immediately with the requisite corrections and clarifications.\nBe that as it may, Fichte never stopped trying to refine his\nphilosophical insights and to revise his systematic presentation of\nthe same. Thus there are more than a dozen different full-scale\npresentations or versions of the Wissenschaftslehre, most of\nwhich were written after his departure from Jena. \u201cThe\nWissenschaftslehre\u201d is not the name of a book; it is\nthe name of a system of philosophy, one capable of being\nexpounded in a variety of different ways. Despite the striking\ndifferences between the earlier and later versions of his lectures on\nthe foundations of his system, Fichte always insisted that the\n\u201cspirit\u201d of the same remained unaltered\u2014a claim that\ncontinues to be challenged and debated by Fichte scholars.\n\nIn 1805 Fichte spend a semester as a professor at the University of\nErlangen, but returned to Berlin in the fall of that year. The next\nyear, 1806, he published in rapid succession three popular and\nwell-received books, all of which were based upon earlier series of\npublic lectures that he had delivered in Berlin: On the Essence of\nthe Scholar (a reworking of some of the same themes first\naddressed in the similarly titled lectures of 1794); The\nCharacteristics of the Present Age (an attempt to show the\nimplications of his \u201csystem of freedom\u201d for a speculative\nphilosophy of history); and Guide to the Blessed Life, or the\nDoctrine of Religion (an eloquent and somewhat mystically tinged\ntreatise on the relationship between transcendental philosophy and\ngenuine religion). Taken together, these three \u201cpopular\u201d\nworks are remarkable blends of speculative profundity and rhetorical\neloquence.\n\nWith the entry of the French army of occupation into Berlin in 1806,\nFichte joined the Prussian government in exile in K\u00f6nigsberg,\nwhere he delivered yet another course of lectures on the\nWissenschaftslehre and wrote an important short book on\nMachiavelli as Author (1807), which defends a form of\nRealpolitik that at least appears to contrast quite starkly\nwith the liberalism and political idealism of Fichte\u2019s earlier\npolitical writings. Fichte soon returned to occupied Berlin, however,\nwhere, in the winter of 1807/8, he delivered his celebrated\nAddresses to the German Nation (published in 1808). Though\nthese lectures later obtained a place of dubious honor as founding\ndocuments in the history of German nationalism, they are mainly\nconcerned with the issue of national identity (and particularly with\nthe relationship between language and nationality) and the question of\nnational education (which is the main topic of the work)\u2014both of\nwhich are understood by Fichte as means toward a larger, cosmopolitan\nend.\n\nFichte had always had a lively interest in pedagogical issues and\nassumed a leading role in planning the new Prussian university to be\nestablished in Berlin (though his own detailed plans for the same were\neventually rejected in favor of those put forward by Wilhelm von\nHumboldt). When the new university finally opened in 1810, Fichte was\nthe first head of the philosophical faculty as well as the first\nelected rector of the university. His final years saw no diminishment\nin the pace either of his public activity or of his philosophical\nefforts. He continued to produce new lectures on the foundations and\nfirst principles of his system, as well as new introductory lectures\non philosophy in general (\u201cLogic and Philosophy\u201d [1812]\nand \u201cThe Facts of Consciousness\u201d [1813]), political\nphilosophy (\u201cSystem of the Doctrine of Right\u201d [1812] and\n\u201cDoctrine of the State\u201d [1813]) and ethics (\u201cSystem\nof Ethical Theory\u201d [1812]). As presaged perhaps by his earlier\nbook on Machiavelli, these late forays into the domain of practical\nphilosophy betray a darker view of human nature and defend a more\nauthoritarian view of the state than anything to be found in\nFichte\u2019s earlier writings on these subject.\n\nIn 1813 Fichte canceled his lectures so that his students could enlist\nin the \u201cWar of Liberation\u201d against Napoleon, of which\nFichte himself proved to be an indirect casualty. From his wife, who\nwas serving as a volunteer nurse in a Berlin military hospital, he\ncontracted a fatal infection of which he died on January 29, 1814.\nAlmost to the moment of his death he continued his lifelong efforts to\nrethink and to re-examine the basic foundations and systematic\nimplications of his philosophy, as is rather poignantly reflected in\nthe remarkable philosophical \u201cDiary\u201d in which he recorded\nhis thoughts during this final period.\n2. Fichte\u2019s Philosophical Project\n\nThe primary task of Fichte\u2019s system of philosophy (the\nWissenschaftslehre) is to reconcile freedom with necessity,\nor, more specifically, to explain how freely willing, morally\nresponsible agents can at the same time be considered part of a world\nof causally conditioned material objects in space and time.\nFichte\u2019s strategy for answering this question\u2014at least in\nhis early writings, which are the ones upon which his historical\nreputation as a philosopher has (at least until recently) been\ngrounded and hence are the ones to be expounded here\u2014was to\nbegin simply with the ungrounded assertion of the subjective\nspontaneity and freedom (infinity) of the I and then to proceed to a\ntranscendental derivation of objective necessity and limitation\n(finitude) as a condition necessary for the possibility of the former.\nThis is the meaning of his description, in his \u201cFirst\nIntroduction to the Wissenschaftslehre,\u201d of\nphilosophy\u2019s task as that of \u201cdisplaying the foundation of\nexperience\u201d or \u201cexplaining the basis of the system of\nrepresentations accompanied by a feeling of necessity.\u201d Fichte\nderived this conception of the task and strategy of philosophy from\nhis study of Kant, and no matter how far his own system seemed to\ndiverge from \u201cthe letter\u201d of the Critical philosophy,\nFichte always maintained that it remained true to \u201cthe\nspirit\u201d of the same. Central to this \u201cspirit,\u201d for\nFichte, is an uncompromising insistence upon the practical certainty\nof human freedom and a thoroughgoing commitment to the task of\nproviding a transcendental account of ordinary experience that could\nexplain the objectivity and necessity of theoretical reason\n(cognition) in a manner consistent with the practical affirmation of\nhuman liberty. Though Fichte attributed the discovery of this task to\nKant, he believed that it was first accomplished successfully only in\nthe Wissenschaftslehre, which he therefore described as the\nfirst \u201csystem of human freedom.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to clarify the task and method of transcendental\nphilosophy, Fichte insisted upon the sharp distinction between the\n\u201cstandpoint\u201d of natural consciousness (which it is the\ntask of philosophy to \u201cderive,\u201d and hence to\n\u201cexplain\u201d) and that of transcendental reflection, which is\nthe standpoint required of the philosopher. He thus insisted that\nthere is no conflict between transcendental idealism and the\ncommonsense realism of everyday life. On the contrary, the whole point\nof the former is to demonstrate the necessity and unavailability of\nthe latter.\n\nHowever \u201cKantian\u201d in spirit Fichte\u2019s enterprise\nmight have been, he was at the same time all too keenly aware of what\nhe considered to be certain glaring weaknesses and inadequacies in\nKant\u2019s own execution of this project. Taking to heart the\ncriticisms of such contemporaries as F. H. Jacobi, Salomon Maimon, and\nG. E. Schulze, Fichte propounded a radically revised version of the\nCritical philosophy. First of all, he argued that the very concept of\na \u201cthing in itself,\u201d understood as a mind-independent,\nexternal \u201ccause\u201d of sensations, is indefensible on\nCritical grounds. In addition, he maintained that Kant\u2019s denial\nof the possibility of \u201cintellectual intuition,\u201d though\ncertainly justified as a denial of the possibility of any non-sensory\nawareness of external objects, is nevertheless difficult to reconcile\nwith certain other Kantian doctrines regarding the I\u2019s immediate\npresence to itself both as a (theoretically) cognizing subject (the\ndoctrine of the transcendental apperception) and as a (practically)\nstriving moral agent (the doctrine of the categorical imperative).\n\nHis study of the writings of K. L. Reinhold convinced Fichte that the\nsystematic unity of the Critical philosophy\u2014specifically, the\nunity of theoretical and practical reason, of the First and Second\nCritiques\u2014was insufficiently evident in Kant\u2019s\nown presentation of his philosophy and that the most promising way to\ndisplay the unity in question would be to provide both theoretical and\npractical philosophy with a common foundation. The first task for\nphilosophy, Fichte therefore concluded, is to discover a single,\nself-evident starting point or first principle from which one could\nthen somehow \u201cderive\u201d both theoretical and practical\nphilosophy, which is to say, our experience of ourselves as finite\ncognizers and as finite agents. Not only would such a strategy\nguarantee the systematic unity of philosophy itself, but, more\nimportantly, it would also display what Kant hinted at but never\ndemonstrated: viz., the underlying unity of reason itself.\n\nSince it is a central task of philosophy, so construed, to establish\nthe very possibility of any knowledge or science\n(Wissenschaft) whatsoever, Fichte proposed to replace the\ndisputed term \u201cphilosophy\u201d (or \u201clove of\nwisdom\u201d) with the new term Wissenschaftslehre or\n\u2018Theory of Science\u2019\u2014a name intended to highlight the\ndistinctively \u201csecond order\u201d character of philosophical\nreflection. Though Fichte\u2019s proposal never caught on as a\ngeneral name for what was once called \u201cphilosophy,\u201d it did\nbecome the universally acknowledged name for his own distinctive\nversion of transcendental idealism. Here again, it is important to\nkeep in mind that \u201cWissenschaftslehre\u201d is not the\nname of any particular Fichtean treatise, but is instead the general\nname for his entire system or project\u2014an allegedly\nall-encompassing system that consists of a number of interrelated\nparts or systematic subdisciplines and an overarching project that\ncould and would be expounded in a series of radically different\npresentations, employing a bewildering variety of systematic\nvocabularies.\n3. The Starting Point of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre\n\nIn order to construct any genuine philosophy of freedom, maintained\nFichte, the reality of freedom itself must simply be presupposed and\nthus treated as an incontrovertible \u201cfact of reason\u201d in\nthe Kantian sense. This, of course, is not to deny the possibility of\nraising skeptical, theoretically grounded objections to such claims;\non the contrary, it was the very impossibility of any theoretically\nsatisfactory refutation of skepticism concerning the reality of\nfreedom that led Fichte to affirm the inescapable \u201cprimacy of\nthe practical\u201d with respect to the selection of one\u2019s\nphilosophical starting point.\n\nTo the extent that any proposed first principle of philosophy is\nsupposed to be the first principle of all knowledge and hence of all\nargument, it clearly cannot be derived from any higher principle and\nhence cannot be established by any sort of reasoning. Furthermore,\nFichte maintained that there are two and only two possible starting\npoints for the philosophical project of \u201cexplaining\u201d\nexperience: namely, the concept of pure selfhood (which Fichte\nassociated with pure freedom) and that of pure thinghood (which Fichte\nassociated with utter necessity)\u2014neither of which can be\nwarranted, qua philosophical starting point, by a direct appeal to\nexperience, and each of which can be arrived at only by a\nself-conscious act of philosophical abstraction from ordinary\nexperience (within which freedom and necessity, subject and object,\nare invariably joined as well as distinguished).\n\nThe two rival philosophical strategies made possible by these opposed\nstarting points are unforgettably limned by Fichte in his two 1797\n\u201cIntroductions to the Wissenschaftslehre,\u201d in\nwhich he characterizes the sort of philosophy that begins with the\npure I as \u201cidealism\u201d and that which begins with the thing\nin itself as \u201cdogmatism.\u201d Since, according to\nFichte\u2019s earlier argument in Concerning the Concept of the\nWissenschaftslehre, a unified system of philosophy can have one\nand only one first principle, and since there are two and only two\npossible first principles, then it follows that no \u201cmixed\u201d\nsystem of idealism/dogmatism is possible. Moreover, since dogmatism,\nas understood by Fichte, unavoidably implies a strict form of\ndeterminism or \u201cintelligible fatalism,\u201d whereas idealism\nis, from the start, committed to the reality of human freedom, it is\nalso practically impossible to reach any sort of\n\u201ccompromise\u201d between two such radically opposed\nsystems.\n\nThough Fichte conceded that neither dogmatism nor idealism could\ndirectly refute its opposite and thus recognized that the choice\nbetween philosophical starting points could never be resolved on\npurely theoretical grounds, he nevertheless denied that any dogmatic\nsystem, that is to say, any system that commences with the concept of\nsheer objectivity, could ever succeed in accomplishing what was\nrequired of all philosophy. Dogmatism, he argued, could never provide\na transcendental deduction of ordinary consciousness, for, in order to\naccomplish this, it would have to make an illicit leap from the realm\nof \u201cthings\u201d to that of mental events or\n\u201crepresentations\u201d [Vorstellungen]. Idealism, in\ncontrast, at least when correctly understood as the kind of Critical\nidealism that demonstrates that the intellect itself must operate in\naccordance with certain necessary laws, can\u2014at least in\nprinciple\u2014accomplish the prescribed task of philosophy and\nexplain our experience of objects (\u201crepresentations accompanied\nby a feeling of necessity\u201d) in terms of the necessary operations\nof the intellect itself, and thus without having to make an illicit\nappeal to things in themselves. To be sure, one cannot decide in\nadvance whether or not any such deduction of experience from the mere\nconcept of free self-consciousness is actually possible.\nThis, Fichte conceded, is something that can be decided only after the\nconstruction of the system in question. Until then, it remains a mere\nhypothesis that the principle of human freedom, for all of\nits practical certainty, is also the proper starting point for a\ntranscendental account of objective experience.\n\nIt must be granted that the truth of the\nWissenschaftslehre\u2019s starting point cannot be\nestablished by any philosophical means, including its utility as a\nphilosophical first principle. On the contrary\u2014and this is one\nof Fichte\u2019s most characteristic and controversial\nclaims\u2014one already has to be convinced, on wholly\nextra-philosophical grounds, of the reality of one\u2019s own freedom\nbefore one can enter into the chain of deductions and\narguments that constitute the Wissenschaftslehre. This is the\nmeaning of Fichte\u2019s oft-cited assertion that \u201cthe kind of\nphilosophy one chooses depends upon the kind of person one is.\u201d\nThe only compelling reason why the transcendental idealist comes to a\nstop with\u2014and thus begins his system with\u2014the proposition\nthat \u201cthe I freely posits itself\u201d is therefore not because\nhe is unable to entertain theoretical doubts on this score nor because\nhe is simply unable to continue the process of reflective abstraction.\nInstead, he appeals to a principle eloquently expressed by Fichte in\nhis essay \u201cOn the Basis of Our Belief in a Moral Governance of\nthe World,\u201d namely: \u201cI cannot go beyond this standpoint\nbecause I am not permitted to do so.\u201d It is precisely because\nthe categorical imperative is in this way invoked to secure the first\nprinciple of his entire system that Fichte felt entitled to make the\nrather startling claim that the Wissenschaftslehre is the\nonly system of philosophy that \u201caccords with duty.\u201d\n4. Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre\n4.1 The \u201cFoundation\u201d\n\nThe published presentation of the first principles of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre commences with the proposition, \u201cthe\nI posits itself\u201d; more specifically, \u201cthe I posits itself\nas an I.\u201d Since this activity of \u201cself-positing\u201d is\ntaken to be the fundamental feature of I-hood in general, the first\nprinciple asserts that \u201cthe I posits itself as\nself-positing.\u201d Unfortunately, this starting point is somewhat\nobscured in Part I of the Foundation of the Entire\nWissenschaftslehre by a difficult and somewhat forced attempt on\nFichte\u2019s part to connect this starting point to the logical law\nof identity, as well as by the introduction of two additional\n\u201cfirst principles,\u201d corresponding to the logical laws of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason. (Significantly, this\ndistraction is eliminated entirely in the 1796/99\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo, which begins with the simple\n\u201cpostulate\u201d or \u201csummons\u201d to the reader:\n\u201cthink the I, and observe what is involved in doing\nthis.\u201d)\n\n\u201cTo posit\u201d (setzen) means simply \u201cto be\naware of,\u201d \u201cto reflect upon,\u201d or \u201cto be\nconscious of\u201d; this term does not imply that the I must simply\n\u201ccreate\u201d its objects of consciousness. The principle in\nquestion simply states that the essence of I-hood lies in the\nassertion of ones own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness\npresupposes self-consciousness (the Kantian \u201cI think,\u201d\nwhich must, at least in principle, be able to accompany all our\nrepresentations). Such immediate self-identify, however, cannot be\nunderstood as a psychological \u201cfact,\u201d no matter how\nprivileged, nor as an \u201caction\u201d or \u201caccident\u201d\nof some previously existing substance or being. To be sure, it is an\n\u201caction\u201d of the I, but one that is identical with the very\nexistence of the same. In Fichte\u2019s technical terminology, the\noriginal unity of self-consciousness is to be understood as both an\naction and as the product of the same: as a Tathandlung or\n\u201cfact/act,\u201d a unity that is presupposed by and contained\nwithin every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, though it\nnever appears as such therein.\n\nThis same \u201cidentity in difference\u201d of original\nself-consciousness might also be described as an \u201cintellectual\nintuition,\u201d inasmuch as it involves the immediate\npresence of the I to itself, prior to and independently of any sensory\ncontent. To be sure, such an \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d\nnever occurs, as such, within empirical consciousness; instead, it\nmust simply be presupposed (that is, \u201cposited\u201d) in order\nto explain the possibility of actual consciousness, within which\nsubject and object are always already distinguished. The occurrence of\nsuch an original intellectual intuition is itself inferred, not\nintuited.\n\nUnfortunately, Fichte confuses matters by sometimes using the term\n\u201cinner\u201d or \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d to\ndesignate something else entirely: namely, the act of\nphilosophical reflection or purified self-observation through\nwhich the philosopher becomes conscious of the transcendental\nconditions for the possibility of ordinary experience\u2014among\nwhich, of course, is the occurrence of the \u201coriginal\u201d\nintellectual intuition as a Tathandlung. On other occasions,\nhe employs the term \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d in yet\nanother sense: namely, to designate our direct, practical awareness\nwithin everyday life of our moral obligations (categorical imperative\nqua \u201creal intellectual intuition\u201d). Given the\nsubsequent abuse of this term by Schelling and the romantics, as well\nas the confusion that one sometimes finds among expositors of Fichte\non this issue, it is crucial to recognize systematic ambiguity of the\nterm \u201cintellectual intuition\u201d in Fichte\u2019s own\nwritings.\n\nA fundamental corollary of Fichte\u2019s understanding of I-hood\n(Ichheit) as a kind of fact/act is his denial that\nthe I is originally any sort of \u201cthing\u201d or\n\u201csubstance.\u201d Instead, the I is simply what it posits\nitself to be, and thus its \u201cbeing\u201d is, so to speak, a\nconsequence of its self-positing, or rather, is co-terminus with the\nsame. The first principle of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre is\nthus equally \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201ctheoretical,\u201d\ninsofar as the act described by this principle is a\n\u201cdoing\u201d as well as a \u201cknowing,\u201d a deed as well\nas a cognition. Thus the problematic unity of theoretical and\npractical reason is guaranteed from the start, inasmuch as this very\nunity is a condition for the possibility of self-consciousness.\n\nAfter establishing the first principle and conceiving the act\nexpressed therein, the philosophical task is then to discover what\nother acts must necessarily occur as conditions for the possibility of\nthe original, \u201csimply posited,\u201d first act and then to do\nthe same for each of these successively discovered acts (or the\ntheorems in which they are formulated). By continuing in this manner,\none will, according to Fichte, finally arrive at a complete deduction\nof the a priori structure of ordinary experience or, what amount to\nthe same thing, a complete inventory of the \u201coriginal acts of\nthe mind.\u201d This is precisely the task of the first or\n\u201cfoundational\u201d portion of the Jena system.\n\nJust as we are never directly aware of the original act of\nself-positing with which the system commences, so are we also\nunaware\u2014except, of course, from the artificial standpoint of\nphilosophical reflection\u2014of each of these additional\n\u201cnecessary but unconscious\u201d acts that are derived as\nconditions necessary for the possibility of the originally posited act\nof self-positing. Furthermore, though we must, due to the discursive\ncharacter of reflection itself, distinguish each of these acts from\nthe others that it is conditioned by and that are, in turn,\nconditioned by it, none of these individual acts actually occurs in\nisolation from all of the others. Transcendental philosophy is thus an\neffort to analyze what is in fact the single,\nsynthetic act through which the I posits for itself both\nitself and its world, thereby becoming aware in a single moment of\nboth its freedom and its limitations, its infinity and its finitude.\nThe result of such an analysis is the recognition that, although\n\u201cthe I simply posits itself,\u201d its freedom is never\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201cunlimited\u201d; instead, freedom\nproves to be conceivable\u2014and hence the I itself proves to be\npossible\u2014only as limited and finite. Despite widespread\nmisunderstanding of this point, the Wissenschaftslehre is not\na theory of the absolute I. Instead, the conclusion of both the\nFoundation of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre and of the\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo is that the \u201cabsolute\nI\u201d is a mere abstraction and that the only sort of I that can\nactually exist or act is a finite, empirical, embodied, individual\nself.\n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit\nitself only insofar as it posits itself as limited (and hence divided\nagainst itself, inasmuch as it also posits itself as unlimited or\n\u201cabsolute\u201d). Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its\nown limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits.\nThe finite I (the intellect) cannot be the ground of its own\npassivity. Instead, according to Fichte\u2019s analysis, if the I is\nto posit itself at all, it must simply discover itself to be\nlimited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as a\n\u2018check\u2019 or Ansto\u00df to the free, practical\nactivity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a\nlimit for the I only insofar as the I posits it as such. I does this,\naccording to Fichte\u2019s analysis, by positing its own limitation,\nfirst, as a mere \u201cfeeling,\u201d then as a\n\u201csensation,\u201d then as an \u201cintuition\u201d of a\nthing, and finally as a \u201cconcept.\u201d The\nAnsto\u00df thus provides the essential occasion or impetus\nthat first sets in motion the entire complex train of activities that\nfinally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves as\nempirical individuals and of a world of spatio-temporal material\nobjects.\n\nThough this doctrine of the Ansto\u00df may seem to play a\nrole in Fichte\u2019s philosophy not unlike that which has sometimes\nbeen assigned to the thing in itself in the Kantian system, the\nfundamental difference is this: the Ansto\u00df is not\nsomething foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the I\u2019s original\nencounter with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the Not-I is\nthe cause or ground of the Ansto\u00df, Fichte argues that\nthe former is posited by the I precisely in order to\n\u201cexplain\u201d to itself the latter, that is, in order to\nbecome conscious of the same. Though the Wissenschaftslehre\ndemonstrates that such an Ansto\u00df must occur if\nself-consciousness is to be actual, transcendental philosophy itself\nis quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such\nan Ansto\u00df\u2014except as a condition for the\npossibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to\nwhat can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience.\nAccording to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain, for\nexample, why the world has a spatio-temporal character and a causal\nstructure, but it can never explain why objects have the particular\nsensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate\nindividual rather than another. This is something that the I simply\nhas to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom,\nand indeed, as a condition for the latter. (It must be admitted,\nhowever, that Fichte\u2019s own ambitious descriptions of his project\nsometimes obscure the essential limits of the same and that he\nsometimes gives his readers the false impression that the\nWissenschaftslehre proposes to provide a complete a priori\ndeduction of all the empirical details of experience. This however is\ncertainly not the case.)\n\nDespite this important stricture on the scope of transcendental\nphilosophy, there remains much that can be demonstrated within the\nfoundational portion of the Wissenschaftslehre. For example,\nit can be shown that the I could not become conscious of its own\nlimits in the manner required for the possibility of any\nself-consciousness unless it also possessed an original and\nspontaneous ability to synthesize the finite and the infinite. In this\nsense, the Wissenschaftslehre deduces the power of productive\nimagination as an original power of the mind. Similarly, it can be\nshown that the I could not be \u201cchecked\u201d in the manner\nrequired for the possibility of consciousness unless it possessed, in\naddition to its original \u201ctheoretical\u201d power of productive\nimaginative, an equally original \u201cpractical\u201d power of\nsheer willing, which, once \u201cchecked,\u201d is immediately\nconverted into a capacity for endless striving. The foundational\nportion of the Wissenschaftslehre thus also includes a\ndeduction of the categorical imperative (albeit in a particularly\nabstract and morally empty form) and of the practical power of the I.\nFor Fichte, therefore, \u201cthe primacy of the practical\u201d\nmeans not simply that philosophy must recognize a certain autonomous\nsphere within which practical reason is efficacious and practical\nconsiderations are appropriate; instead, it implies something much\nstronger: namely, the recognition that, as Fichte puts it, \u201cthe\npractical power is the innermost root of the I\u201d and thus that\n\u201cour freedom itself is a theoretical determining principle of\nour world.\u201d The Wissenschaftslehre as a whole can\ntherefore be described as a massive effort to demonstrate that reason\ncould not be theoretical if it were not also practical\u2014at the\nsame time, to be sure, that also demonstrates that reason could not be\npractical if were not also theoretical.\n\nFreedom, according to Fichte\u2019s argument, is possible and actual\nonly within the context of limitation and necessity, and thus it is\nnever \u201cabsolute,\u201d but always limited and finite. On the\nother hand, just as surely as a free subject must posit its freedom\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d\u2014that is to say, \u2018purely and\nsimply\u2019 (schlechthin) and \u201cfor no reason\u201d\nwhatsoever\u2014so must it never identify itself with any determinate\nor limited state of its own being. On the contrary, a finite free self\nmust constantly strive to transform both the natural and the human\nworlds in accordance with its own freely-posited goals. The sheer\nunity of the self, which was posited as the starting point of the\nFoundations, is thereby transformed into an idea of\nreason in the Kantian sense: the actual I is always finite and divided\nagainst itself, and hence it is always striving for a sheer\nself-determinacy that it never achieves. Between the original\nabstraction of pure selfhood as sheer Tathandlung and the\nconcluding (necessary) idea of a self that is only what it determines\nitself to be, in which \u201cis\u201d and \u201cought\u201d wholly\ncoincide, lies the entire realm of actual consciousness and real human\nexperience.\n4.2 Philosophy of Nature\n\nHaving established the foundation of his new system, Fichte then\nturned to the task of constructing upon this foundation a\nfully-articulated transcendental system, the overall structure of\nwhich is most clearly outlined in the concluding section of the\ntranscripts of his lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova\nmethodo. According to this plan, which has no analog in\nFichte\u2019s later writings, the Entire Wissenschaftslehre\nis to consisting of four, systematically interrelated parts:: (1)\nfirst philosophy, which corresponds to the \u201cfoundational\u201d\nportion of the system, as presented in the Foundation of the\nentire Wissenschaftslehre and revised in the lectures on\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo; (2) \u201ctheoretical\nphilosophy\u201d or \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d (3)\n\u201cpractical philosophy\u201d or ethics (corresponding to the\ncontent of the System of Ethics); and (4) \u201cphilosophy\nof the postulates,\u201d which includes the subdisciplines of\n\u201cnatural law\u201d or \u201ctheory of right\u201d (as\nexpounded in the Foundation of Natural Right) and philosophy\nof religion.\n\nBy \u201cphilosophy of nature,\u201d Fichte seems to have had in\nmind something similar to Kant\u2019s Metaphysical First\nPrinciples of Nature, though Fichte himself devoted very little\nattention to the execution of such a project. The closest he ever came\nto developing a philosophy of nature according to transcendental\nprinciples is the compressed account of space, time, and matter\npresented in the Outline of the Distinctive Character of the\nWissenschaftslehre with Respect to the Theoretical Faculty and\nthe lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo. In neither\nof these works, however, does he make any effort to distinguish\nrigorously between the \u201ctheoretical\u201d aspect of the\nfoundational portion of his system and a distinctively\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d subdivision of the same (\u201cphilosophy\nof nature\u201d). In fact, a \u201cphilosophy of nature in\naccordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre\u201d turns out to me even more modest\nthan Kant\u2019s and more closely resembles what later came to be\ncalled the philosophy of (natural) science than it does the\nspeculative Naturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel. Indeed,\ndisagreement concerning the compatibility of a rigorously\ntranscendental philosophy with a speculative, a priori\n\u201cphilosophy of nature\u201d was the very issue that\nprecipitated the rift between Fichte and his erstwhile disciple,\nSchelling. The popular picture of Fichte\u2019s attitude toward\nnature, namely, that he viewed the latter almost entirely from the\nperspective of human projects, that is, as the necessary realm for\nmoral striving, is therefore very close to the truth.\n4.3 Ethics\n\nIn contrast to Fichte\u2019s rather cursory treatment of purely\ntheoretical philosophy, ethics or \u201cpractical philosophy,\u201d\nwhich analyzes the determinate ways in which willing and acting are\ndeterminable by principles of pure reason, constitutes a major portion\nof the Jena system, and the System of Ethics is\nFichte\u2019s longest single book. Whereas theoretical philosophy\nexplains how the world necessarily is, practical philosophy\nexplains how the world ought to be, which is to say, how it\nought to be altered by rational beings. Ethics thus considers\nthe object of consciousness not as something given or even as\nsomething constructed by necessary laws of consciousness, but rather\nas something to be produced by a freely acting subject, consciously\nstriving to establish and to accomplish its own goals and guided only\nby its own self-legislated laws. The specific task of\nFichte\u2019s ethics is therefore, first of all, to deduce the\ncategorical imperative (in its distinctively moral sense) from the\ngeneral obligation to determine oneself freely, and, second, to deduce\nfrom this the particular obligations that apply to every free and\nfinite rational being.\n\nLike all of Fichte\u2019s systematic treatises of the Jena period,\nThe System of Ethics begins with a detailed analysis of what\nis involved in the self-positing of the I. In this case, the focus is\nupon the necessity that the I posit for itself its own activity or\n\u201cefficacy,\u201d and upon a detailed analysis of the\nconditions for doing this. In this manner Fichte deduces what he calls\n\u201cthe principle of all practical philosophy,\u201d viz., that\nsomething objective (a being) follows from something subjective (a\nconcept), and hence that the I must ascribe to itself a power of free\npurposiveness or causality in the sensible world. The I must posit\nitself as an embodied will, and only as such does it\n\u201cdiscover\u201d itself at all. From this starting point Fichte\nthen proceeds to a deduction of the principle of morality: namely,\nthat I must think of my freedom as standing under a certain necessary\nlaw or categorical imperative, which Fichte calls\n\u201cthe law of self-sufficiency\u201d or \u201cautonomy,\u201d\nand that I ought always to determine my freedom in accordance\nwith this law. This, therefore, is the task of the philosophical\nscience of \u201cethics,\u201d as understood by Fichte: to provide\nan a priori deduction of our moral nature in general and of our\nspecific duties as human beings.\n\nViewed from the perspective of practical philosophy, the world really\nis nothing more than what Fichte once described as \u201cthe material\nof our duty made sensible,\u201d which is precisely the viewpoint\nadopted by the morally engaged, practically striving subject. On the\nother hand, this is not the only way the world can be viewed, and,\nmore specifically, it is not the only way in which it is construed by\ntranscendental philosophy. For this reason it is somewhat misleading\nto characterized the Wissenschaftslehre as a whole as a\nsystem of \u201cethical idealism.\u201d As noted above, Fichte\ncertainly does succeed in constructing an account of consciousness\nthat fully integrates the imperatives and activities of practical\nreason into the very structure of the latter, but this integration is\nalways balanced by a recognition of the constitutive role of\ntheoretical reason and of the sheer, contingent \u201cgiveness\u201d\nof the I\u2019s original determinacy (doctrine of the\nAnsto\u00df).\n4.4 Philosophy of Law (Recht)\n\nThe final portion of the Jena system is devoted to \u201cthe\nphilosophy of the postulates,\u201d a discipline that Fichte\nconceived of as occupying the middle ground between purely theoretical\nand purely practical philosophy. In this portion of the system the\nworld is considered neither as it simply is nor as it simply ought to\nbe; instead, either the practical realm of freedom is viewed from the\ntheoretical perspective of the natural world (in which case one\nconsiders the postulates that theoretical reason addresses to\npractical reason) or else, alternatively, the natural world is viewed\nfrom the perspective of practical reason or the moral law (in which\ncase one considers the postulates that practical reason addresses to\ntheoretical reason). The first of these perspectives is that of\njuridical philosophy or philosophy of law, or what Fichte calls the\n\u201cdoctrine of right\u201d (Rechtslehre); the latter is\nthat of the philosophy of religion.\n\nFichte\u2019s philosophy of right (or of \u201cnatural law\u201d),\nas expounded in his Foundation of Natural Right, is one of\nthe most original and influential portions of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre. Written prior to Kant\u2019s treatment\nof the same topic (in Part One of the Metaphysics of Morals),\nFichte\u2019s philosophy of right is notable, first of all, because\nof the way in which it distinguishes sharply between the realm of\nethics and that of \u201cright\u201d and tries to develop a complete\ntheory of the latter (a \u201ctheory of justice\u201d) without\nappealing to the categorical imperative or the moral law, and\nsecondly, because of the inclusion within this theory of a thoroughly\noriginal \u201cdeduction\u201d of the social character of human\nbeings.\n\nFichte\u2019s transcendental account of natural right proceeds from\nthe general principle that the I must posit itself as an\nindividual in order to posit itself at all, and that in order\nto posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as\n\u201csummoned\u201d or \u201csolicited\u201d by another\nfree individual\u2014summoned, that is, to limit its own freedom out\nof respect for that of the freedom of the other. The same condition\napplies, of course, to the other; hence, mutual recognition of\nrational individuals turns out to be condition necessary for the\npossibility of I-hood in general. This a priori deduction of\nintersubjectivity is so central to the conception of selfhood\ndeveloped in the Jena Wissenschaftslehre that Fichte, in his\nlectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo, incorporated it\ninto his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system,\nwhere the \u201csummons\u201d takes its place alongside\n\u201coriginal feeling\u201d (which takes the place of the earlier\n\u201ccheck\u201d) as both a limit upon the absolute\nfreedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.\n\nThe specific task of Fichte\u2019s theory of right is to consider the\nspecific ways in which the freedom of each individual must be\nrestricted in order that several individuals can live together with\nthe maximum amount of mutual freedom, and it derives its a priori\nconcepts of the laws of social interaction entirely from the sheer\nconcept of an individual I, as conditions for the possibility of the\nlatter. Fichte\u2019s concept of right therefore obtains its binding\nforce not from the ethical law, but rather from the general laws of\nthinking and from enlightened self-interest, and the force of such\nconsiderations is hypothetical rather than categorical. The theory of\nright examines how the freedom of each individual must be externally\nlimited if a free society of free and equal individuals is to\nbe possible.\n\nUnlike Kant, Fichte does not treat political philosophy merely as a\nsubdivision of moral theory. On the contrary, it is an independent\nphilosophical discipline with a topic and a priori principles of its\nown. Whereas ethics analyzes the concept of what is demanded\nof a freely willing subject, the theory of right describes what such a\nsubject is permitted to do (as well as what he can rightfully\nbe coerced to do). Whereas ethics is concerned with the inner\nworld of conscience, the theory of right is concerned only with the\nexternal, public realm, though only insofar as the latter can be\nviewed as an embodiment of freedom.\n\nHaving established the general, albeit hypothetical concept of right,\nFichte then turns to an investigation of the conditions necessary for\nthe realization or \u201capplication\u201d of the same: that is, for\nthe actual coexistence of free individuals, or the existence of a free\nsociety. The sum of these \u201cconditions\u201d constitute the sum\nof our \u201cnatural rights\u201d as human beings, rights that can\nbe instantiated and guaranteed only within a deliberately constructed\nfree society. On purely a priori grounds, therefore, Fichte purports\nto be able to determine the general requirements of such a community\nand the sole justification for legitimate political coercion and\nobligation.\n\nThe precise relationship of Fichte\u2019s theory of right to the\nsocial contract tradition is complex, but the general outline is as\nfollows: Fichte presents an a priori argument for the fundamentally\nsocial character of human beings, an argument grounded upon\nan analysis of the very structure of self-consciousness and the\nrequirements for self-positing. Only after this\n\u201cdeduction\u201d of the concept of right and of the\napplicability of the same does he explicitly introduce the notion of\nwhat he calls the Staatsb\u00fcrgervertrag or\n\u201ccitizens\u2019 contract,\u201d a notion that he goes on to\nanalyze into a series of distinguishable moments, including the\n\u201ccivil contract\u201d proper (or \u201cproperty\ncontract\u201d), the \u201cprotection contract,\u201d and the\n\u201ccontract of unification,\u201d all of which must be\nsupplemented by the contracts of \u201csubjection\u201d and\n\u201cexpiation.\u201d Fichte thus propounds what one might call a\n\u201ccontract theory of the state,\u201d but not of human\ncommunity.\n\nAs numerous commentators, beginning with Hegel, whose own\nPhilosophy of Right was strongly influenced, both positively\nand negatively, by Fichte\u2019s Foundations of Natural\nRight, have pointed out, the actual theory of the state that\nFichte himself, in Part Two of that work, erected upon what would\nappear to be a rather \u201cliberal\u201d theoretical foundation\ncontains many elements that are not usually associated with the\nindividualistic, liberal tradition\u2014including a general\nindifference to questions of constitutional structure, public\nparticipation in government, etc., and a strong emphasis upon the\n\u201cpolice\u201d functions of the state (functions which, for\nFichte, were not limited to concerns of security, but also included\nthose of social welfare). This, however, is not particularly\nsurprising, since the function of the state in Fichte\u2019s system\nis primarily to employ coercion to guarantee that the parties to the\ncontract will, in fact, do what they have promised to do and to insure\nthat every citizen will have an opportunity to realize his own\n(limited) freedom. One of the more remarkable features of\nFichte\u2019s conception of right is that every citizen is entitled\nto the full and productive employment of his labor, and hence that the\nstate has a duty to manage the economy accordingly. The truth is that\nFichte\u2019s social and political theory is very difficult to fit\ninto the usual categories, but combines certain elements usually\nassociated with liberal individualism with others more commonly\nassociated with communitarian statism.\n4.5 Philosophy of Religion\n\nIn addition to the postulates addressed by theoretical to practical\nreason, there are also those addressed by practical reason to nature\nitself. The latter is the domain of the transcendental philosophy of\nreligion, which is concerned solely with the question of the extent to\nwhich the realm of nature can be said to accommodate itself to the\naims of morality. The questions dealt with within such a philosophy of\nreligion are those concerning the nature, limits, and legitimacy of\nour belief in divine providence. The philosophy of religion, as\nconceived by Fichte, has nothing to do with the historical claims of\nrevealed religion or with particular religious traditions and\npractices. Indeed, this is precisely the distinction between\nphilosophy of religion and \u201ctheology.\u201d\n\nAs noted above, Fichte never had a chance to develop this final\nsubdivision of his Jena system, beyond the tentative foray into this\ndomain represented by his controversial essay \u201cConcerning the\nBasis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the World\u201d and the\nworks he contributed to the ensuing \u201catheism controversy.\u201d\nIn \u201cConcerning the Basis of our Belief\u201d he certainly seems\nto contend that, so far as philosophy is concerned, the realm of the\ndivine is that of this world, albeit viewed in terms of the\nrequirements of the moral law, in which case it is transformed from\nthe natural to the \u201cthe moral world order,\u201d and that no\nfurther inference to a transcendent \u201cmoral lawgiver\u201d is\ntheoretically or practically required or warranted. In this same essay\nFichte also sought to draw a sharp distinction between religion and\nphilosophy (a distinction parallel to the crucial distinction between\nthe \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nstandpoints) and to defend philosophy\u2019s right to postulate, on\npurely a priori grounds, something like a \u201cmoral world\norder.\u201d Philosophy of religion thus includes a deduction of the\npostulate that our moral actions really do make some difference in the\nworld. But this is about as far as it can go.\n\nWith respect to the existence of God, the argument of Fichte\u2019s\nessay is primarily negative, inasmuch as it explicitly denies that any\npostulate of the existence of a God independent of the moral law is\njustifiable on philosophical grounds. In the wake of the atheism\ncontroversy, Fichte returned to this subject and, in his \u201cFrom a\nPrivate Letter\u201d and in Part Three of The Vocation of\nMan, attempted to restate his position in a manner that at least\nappeared to be more compatible with the claims of theism.\n5. The later Wissenschaftslehre and the Reception of Fichte\u2019s Philosophy\n\nFor much of the nineteenth century, beginning with Hegel\u2019s\nself-serving interpretation of the history of modern philosophy,\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre was generally assimilated\ninto the larger history of German idealism. Criticized by both\nSchelling and Hegel as a one-sided, \u201csubjective\u201d idealism\nand a prime instance of the \u201cphilosophy of reflection,\u201d\nFichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre was almost universally\ntreated as a superseded rung on the ladder \u201cfrom Kant to\nHegel\u201d and thus assigned a purely historical significance.\nNeglected as the Wissenschaftslehre may have been during this\nperiod, Fichte was not entirely forgotten, but remained influential as\nthe author of the Addresses to the German Nation and was\nalternately hailed and vilified as one of the founders of modern\npan-German nationalism.\n\nThis same situation prevailed throughout much of the twentieth century\nas well, during which Fichte\u2019s fortune seemed closely tied to\nthat of Germany. Particularly during the long periods preceding,\nduring, and following the two World Wars, Fichte was discussed almost\nexclusively in the context of German politics and national identity,\nand his technical philosophy tended to be dismissed as a monstrous or\ncomical speculative aberration of no relevance whatsoever to\ncontemporary philosophy. There were, to be sure, isolated exceptions\nand authors such as Fritz Medicus, Martial Gueroult, Xavier\nL\u00e9on, and Max Wundt who, during the first half of the twentieth\ncentury, took Fichte seriously as a philosopher and made lasting\ncontributions to the study of his thought. But the real boom in Fichte\nstudies has come only in the past six decades, during which the\nWissenschaftslehre has once again become the object of\nintense philosophical scrutiny and lively, world-wide\ndiscussion\u2014as is evidenced by the establishment of large and\nactive professional societies devoted to Fichte in Europe, Japan, and\nNorth America.\n\nJ. H. Stirling once quipped that \u201cFichte had two\nphilosophical epochs; and if both belong to biography, only one\nbelongs to history,\u201d and until quite recently there was a great\ndeal of truth to this observation. Indeed, even today, Fichte\u2019s\ntechnical writings of the post-Jena period remain little-known to the\nvast majority of philosophers. Admittedly, it is hard to recognize\nthese late texts\u2014which drop the strategy of beginning with an\nanalysis of the self, along with the strong emphasis upon the\n\u201cprimacy of the practical,\u201d and which include\nunembarrassed references to an apparently transcendent\n\u201cabsolute\u201d (\u201cBeing,\u201d \u201cAbsolute\nBeing,\u201d \u201cGod\u201d)\u2014as the work of the same author\nwho wrote the Foundations of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre.\nThough Fichte himself always insisted that his basic philosophy\nremained the same, no matter how much his presentation thereof may\nhave altered over the years, many sympathetic readers and not a few\nwell-informed scholars have found it impossible to reconcile this\nclaim with what at least appear to be the profound systematic and\ndoctrinal differences between the \u201cearly\u201d and\n\u201clate\u201d Wissenschaftslehre. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the problematic \u201cunity\u201d of Fichte\u2019s\nthought continues to be vigorously debated by experts in the\nfield.\n\nWhatever one may conclude concerning the relationship between\nFichte\u2019s earlier and later writings, it is certainly the case\nthat, with the publication of numerous, faithfully edited\n\u201cnew\u201d manuscripts of later versions of the\nWissenschaftslehre, the focus of much of the best\ncontemporary Fichte scholarship has shifted to his later texts, most\nof which were entirely unknown to earlier generations of readers.\nSeldom has a new edition of a philosopher\u2019s literary corpus had\na greater effect upon the contemporary reputation of the thinker in\nquestion or a more stimulating effect upon contemporary scholarship\nthan in the case of the monumental new critical edition of\nFichte\u2019s works begun in the early nineteen-sixties under the\nauspices of the Bavarian Academy of the Sciences and the general\neditorship of Reinhard Lauth and others. Now complete, this edition\nhas contributed directly and enormously to the contemporary revival of\ninterest in Fichte\u2019s philosophy in general, and in the later\nversions of the Wissenschaftslehre in particular. Much of the\nbest recent work on Fichte, particularly in Germany, Italy, and Japan,\nhas been devoted exclusively to his later thought. Stirling\u2019s\nobservation is thus no longer true, inasmuch as the work of\nFichte\u2019s \u201csecond epoch\u201d has, however belatedly, now\nbecome the object of genuine and lively philosophical discussion and\ndispute.\n\nIn contrast, anglophone Fichte scholarship, which has also experienced\nquite a renaissance of its own over the past few decades, has remained\nlargely focused upon the \u201cclassical\u201d texts of the Jena\nperiod. This is no doubt due, in large part at least, to the\nappearance, during these same decades, of new, reliable translations\nof almost all of Fichte\u2019s early writings and the lack of\ntranslations of his later, unpublished texts. But it is also a\nreflection of the relatively anemic tradition of Fichte scholarship in\nEngland and North America, where even the early\nWissenschaftslehre has long been neglected and\nunder-appreciated. Until quite recently, virtually no scholars writing\nin English were interested in examining the\nWissenschaftslehre in its own right, but were mainly\nconcerned to determine Fichte\u2019s position in relationship to\nKant\u2019s or Hegel\u2019s. This situation, however, has\nfundamentally altered, and some of the most insightful and original\ncurrent work on Fichte is being done in English. The recent\npublication of an English translation of the Fichte\u2019s second\nseries of lectures on the Wissenschaftslehr from 1804\nsuggests that anglophone Fichte scholarship is at least ready to begin\ncoming to terms with Fichte\u2019s later philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Individual Works and English translations", "Secondary Literature about Fichte and the <em>Wissenschaftslehre</em>"], "cat_ref_text": {"Individual Works and English translations": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "<em>Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung</em>, 1792; 2nd ed.,\n1793.\n\n <ul>", "<em>Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation</em>, trans.
