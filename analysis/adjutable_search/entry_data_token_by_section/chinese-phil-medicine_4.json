    "main_text": "Daoist Medical Traditions and Physicians || Ge Hong\n3.1 Ge Hong\n\n\nGe Hong \u845b\u6d2a (283\u2013343 or 363 CE, a physician and Daoist\nfrom of the Eastern Jin (317\u2013420 CE), was the first of several\nexplicitly Daoist physicians to write about the practice of\nalchemy. He was the author of the Teachings of the Master Who\nEmbraces Simplicity (Baopuzi\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50). The Baopuzi consists of\nseventy chapters (pian \u7bc7): twenty \u201cInner\nChapters\u201d (Baopuzi neipian\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50\u5185\u7bc7) and fifty \u201cOuter\nChapters\u201d (Baopuzi waipian\n\u62b1\u6a38\u5b50\u5916\u7bc7). The two were\neffectively different books that were not combined under one title\nuntil a thousand years after Ge Hong\u2019s time (Sivin1969, 389. For\na partial translation of the waipian see Sailey 1978). Ge Hong\nwas also the author of the Collected Life Stories of Immortals\n(Shen xian zhuan \u795e\u4ed9\u50b3, trans. Campany\n2002) and Biographies of Recluses (Yin yi zhuan\n\u96b1\u9038\u50b3). \n\n\nAccording to his autobiography (Baopuzi waipian, ch. 50;\nSailey 1978, 242\u2013272; Ware (1966, 6\u201321), in his youth he studied the\nConfucian classics, but at the same time, became interested in\nquasi-medical techniques for nourishing the body with the goal of\nachieving immortality. He became a student of the alchemical\nmaster Zheng Yin \u912d\u96b1 (c.215-c.302 CE), and remained his\ndisciple for some fifteen years. After brief success, he abandoned a\nmilitary career to go to the capital at Luoyang to search for books on\nimmortals. After difficulties during the political unrest in the south,\nGe Hong entirely gave up political life and devoted himself to\nimmortality practices. In 316 he returned to the north and was\nnamed a marquis by the Eastern Jin court and took up an administrative\npost. On learning that cinnabar had been discovered in the south\n(in present day North Vietnam), he secured a position as magistrate in\nthe south in Guangxi, where he settled at Mt. Luofu\n\u7f85\u6d6e and began the study of alchemy, remaining there until\nhis death (Sailey 1978, 277\u201378; Ware 1981; Wells 2003).\n\n\nGe Hong was the first to systematically describe the history and\ntheory of Daoist immortality techniques such as \u201cpreserving\nunity\u201d (shou yi \u5b88\u4e00), circulating energy\n(xing qi \u884c\u6c23), \u201cguiding and pulling\u201d\n(dao yin), and sexual longevity techniques (fang\nzhong\u623f\u4e2d, Baopuzi neipian, ch. 2; Lai\nChi-tim 1998, 203-204). But his accounts of these techniques clearly\nreflect an interest in self-cultivation according to broadly Confucian\nprinciples. For example, he considered moral self-cultivation a\nprecondition for the search for immortality; self-cultivation included\nsuch Confucian virtues as benevolence (ren), trustworthiness\n(xin), loyalty (zhong) and filiality (xiao).\nGe Hong criticized Daoist \u201cpure conversation\u201d (qing\ntan) and emphasized the importance of both moral virtue and Daoist\nstudy. His specifically Daoist writings emphasize the importance\nof both \u201cmystery\u201d (xuan \u7384) and\nemptiness (xu \u865b), and all-embracing unity, which the\nDaoist must actively preserve by meditation practices, techniques of\n\u201cpreserving the essence\u201d (bao jing\n\u4fdd\u7cbe) and consuming medicinal herbs (fu yao\n\u670d\u85e5).\n\n\nAs an alchemist, Ge Hong experimented with drugs and minerals. The\n\u201cGold Elixir\u201d (Jin dan \u91d1\u4e39) and\n\u201cYellow and White\u201d (Huang bai \u9ec4\u767d)\nchapters of the Baopuzi neipian survey the\nhistory of alchemy and describe in detail a method for \u201calloying\ncinnabar,\u201d quoting from ancient recipes and \u201ccinnabar\nmethods.\u201d The \u201cImmortal Herbs\u201d (Xian yao\n\u4ed9\u85e5) chapter gives information on medical herbs (Gao 1996,\nQing 1994, Theobald 2013).\n\n\nAlthough Robinet (1997) insists that Ge Hong was only interested in\npharmacology as an adjunct to alchemy, the Baopuzi also\nincludes important material on medicine and pharmacology. Other\npharmacological treatises attributed to him are no longer extant:\nPrescriptions for Rescuing the Dying after the Pulse-taking\n(Zhou hou jiu zu Fang\n\u8098\u5f8c\u6551\u5352\u65b9), Prescriptions from the\nJade Box (\u7389\u51fd\u65b9 Yu han fang), Herbal\nRecipes from the Gold Cabinet (Jin gui yaofang\n\u91d1\u5331\u85e5\u65b9), and Prescriptions for Emergencies\nafter Taking the Pulses (Zhou hou bei ji fang\n\u8098\u540e\u5099\u6025\u65b9), which is said to be the\nfirst Chinese text to mention smallpox (tian hua bing\n\u5929\u82b1\u75c5). Thirteen texts attributed to Ge Hong are\npreserved in the Daoist Canon (Dao zang \u9053\u85cf), but\nmost are probably later works (Robinet 1997, 78\u2013113, Theobald\n2013).\n\n\nIn summary, Ge Hong\u2019s writings combine interests in Confucian\nethics, Daoist self-cultivation and alchemical techniques, and the\ndetails of medicine and pharmacology. \n",
