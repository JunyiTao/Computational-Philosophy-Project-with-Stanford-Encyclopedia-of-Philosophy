    "main_text": "Guifeng Zongmi (780\u2013841)\n7. Guifeng Zongmi (780\u2013841)\n\nTradition identifies Zongmi as the fifth patriarch of Huayan. Zongmi\nspent his early years studying Confucian classics and Buddhism before\ntraining with the Chan (Zen) master Suizhou Daoyuan (750\u2013820). Then,\nfollowing a brief period of studying the Avatamsaka Sutra\nwith Chengguan, Zongmi began an extensive period of writing. His\nefforts focused, at first, on gathering commentaries on various sutras\nand writing his own. In time, he focused on compiling Chan texts to\ncreate a canon for the Chan tradition. These efforts resulted in his\nachieving status as a patriarch for the Heze school of Chan. Although\nZongmi\u2019s Collected Writings on the Source of Chan (Ch.\nChanyuan zhuquanji) is no longer extant, its preface,\nProlegomena to the Collected Writings on the Source of Chan\n(Ch. Chanyuan zhuquanji duxu; T48.2015, trans. Broughton\n2004), survives. \n\nZongmi\u2019s major philosophical work is Inquiry into the Origin\nof Humanity (Ch. Yuanren lun; T45.1886, trans. Gregory\n1995). The title of this book might be a play on Inquiry into the\nOrigin of the Way, an influential anti-Buddhist essay by the\nConfucian philosopher Han Yu (768\u2013824). Zongmi\u2019s book offers, in\neffect, an innovative panjiao system. The central innovation\nis its inclusion of Daoism and Confucianism. Zongmi\u2019s discussion\nof the strengths and weaknesses of each view are detailed, and here we\npresent only some of his arguments. \n\nZongmi states that \n Kongzi and \n Laozi are both great sages, and that\ntheir ethical teachings are extremely beneficial to the common people.\nHowever, Confucians and Daoists claim that humans, animals, and\ninanimate objects all come into existence from the same underlying\n\u201cvital force\u201d (Ch. qi, roughly similar to the\n\u201cboundless\u201d of Anaximander). Zongmi argues that this\ncreates an insoluble problem. Since vital force is originally without\nconsciousness, then since we receive this force in the same way\ngrasses and trees do, either we should lack consciousness or else\ngrasses and trees should be conscious. In addition, Confucians and\nDaoists believe that fate is governed by Heaven (Ch. tian, an\nimpersonal higher power), which acts in accordance with the moral Way.\nZongmi argues that they cannot explain why a moral Heaven allows the\nvirtuous to suffer and the vicious to flourish. Since some who lack\nvirtue flourish, while others with virtue suffer, the distribution of\nrewards and punishments is unjust. \n\nZongmi argues that Buddhists can resolve both dilemmas. Regarding the\nproblem of evil, Zongmi appeals to the Buddhist doctrine of\nreincarnation to explain how the distribution of rewards and\npunishments in the universe is ultimately just. According to this\ndoctrine, the distribution of rewards and punishments is determined\nnot only by one\u2019s actions in one\u2019s current life but also\nby one\u2019s actions in previous lives. So the flourishing of the\nvicious, and the suffering of the virtuous, is attributable to karma\nfrom their past lives. \n\nAccording to Zongmi, the only plausible solution to the problem of\nconsciousness is that fundamental reality is mental, and\nnon-consciousness is the result of a kind of self-deception, where the\nmind fails to realize its objects as manifestations of itself.\n",
