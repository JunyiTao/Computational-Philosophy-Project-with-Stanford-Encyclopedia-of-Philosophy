Moreover, both are closely\nrelated by matters of language. Difficulties encountered in\ntranslation of texts obviously generate difficulties in interpreting\nthem, and vice versa: the less confidence we have that we\nunderstand what a text is about the more difficult it is to be\nconfident of our own (or anyone else\u2019s) translation of it.\nThus an appreciation of problems discussed in this essay must begin\nwith an examination of the issues and problems stemming from the\nclassical language in which Chinese philosophers wrote and edited\ntheir texts long ago, which will not only be necessary for\nunderstanding and evaluating the texts themselves, but perhaps useful\nas well for seeing some more general issues in metaphilosophy,\ncross-cultural philosophy, the philosophy of language, and the\nphilosophy of mind in a somewhat different light.\n A second reason for the complexity of the topics related to this\nentry is that some knowledge of the early philosophical\u2014and\nother\u2014texts were and are prerequisite for understanding all\nlater philosophy because of the frequency of the references to them,\nand also because they provided the basic model for the writing of the\nlater ones. Unfortunately most of these early Chinese texts have come\ndown to us only in corrupted form, increasing significantly the number\nand variety of issues and problems of translating and interpreting\nthem, especially if our primary concern is to provide exegeses and\ntranslations of them in terms of what they meant to the people who\nfirst wrote and read them.\nMoreover, the texts as we have them in English today have been\nvariously translated and interpreted by scholars and others with very\ndifferent backgrounds and interests for most of the past two\ncenturies: missionaries first, followed by merchants and diplomats\nlong-term resident in China, followed in the 20th century\nby academics from a wide variety of disciplines, including history,\nliterature, linguistics, religion, Asian Studies (sinology), and now,\nfor the past several decades, philosophers. Needless to say, many\ndifferent translations and interpretations of virtually all of the\nclassical texts mirror closely the disparate concerns and agendas of\ntheir publishers. They all do, however, share a decidedly Western\norientation in style, outlook, methodology, and more; seldom are\nthings viewed from the Chinese perspective, and consequently charges\nof a Eurocentric bias in Chinese philosophy as a field of study are\nunfortunately not without merit, increasing yet again the problems of\ninterpreting them appropriately.\nIn addition to the unusual nature of the classical Chinese\nlanguage, corrupted texts, and the variety of people who have worked\nwith them, a fourth reason for the complexity of the topic of this\nentry is also the reason significantly responsible for its being the\nonly one of its kind in this Encyclopedia. There are no entries under\n\u201cTranslating and Interpreting\u2026\u201d for Greek\nphilosophy, for example, nor German Idealism or French Postmodernism.\nEven Indian philosophy lacks such an entry. This fact should bring\nhome not just the singularity of the classical Chinese written\nlanguage, compared to contemporary languages derived from the\nproto-Sanskrit Indo-European family of languages written in alphabet\nscripts, but remind us as well of the greater distance between Chinese\nand other cultures from past to present. This is in good measure due\nto geography: India and Greece have been in contact since before the\nAlexandrian conquests, but the Himalayas, Xinjiang and Gobi deserts,\nand the East China Sea made for a fairly solitary cultural development\nin China that for many centuries hindered cross-cultural intercourse\nexcept for the cultures on its periphery, Korea, Japan, and areas of\nSoutheast Asia. The Silk Roads notwithstanding, we find few\ncross-cultural western links with the Chinese as we do for the Indian\n(as, e.g., the Hindu god of fire Agni with Latin ignis, root\nof English \u201cignite\u201d). It is not necessarily that China is\nthe ultimate \u201cOther\u201d for Europeans and for writers in\nEuropean traditions, but rather that its heritage is much like\nEuropean traditions in many of its formal dimensions, yet so different\nin details, and that writers in European traditions have only come\nupon the scope and depth of that heritage comparatively recently. It\nis not for nothing that Leibniz referred to China as the\n\u201cOriental Europe\u201d (Leibniz WoC: 12 [1708]).\nAfter coming to understand how the classical Chinese language\nitself poses problems for translators and interpreters we will then\nexamine other issues methodological, metaphysical, and comparative\nrelating to the reading of classical texts which tend to combine\nexegetical and translation concerns.\nThe primary focus will be on those issues in dispute among scholars\nin the field (not alone philosophers) which have philosophical\nimplications, attempting balanced accounts of both the disputes and the\nimplications. At times authors will be quoted at some length to insure\nthat their positions have not been distorted in the course of their\nnarration.  \nAs noted above, the linguistic focus will be somewhat narrow\ntemporally\u2014by Chinese standards, at least: the period from\nroughly the 7th through the 1st centuries\nBCE. Most of the framing texts that became canonical in one tradition\nor another were written, compiled, edited, and much else during this\nperiod, and the classical language grew and was maturing at the same\ntime. It continued to grow during the whole of later Chinese history,\nand canonical texts were added to the corpus throughout the same\nperiod; but the bases for both were laid during the earlier period,\nsome knowledge of which were (and are) requisite for interpreting and\ntranslating them.\nNone of what has been said up to this point is to suggest that\nstudying Chinese language and early thought is only for the\nclassically curious and linguistically intrepid. There has been an\nexplosion of scholarly growth in classical Chinese studies over the\npast half-century, sufficient in both breadth and depth to allow\nnon-specialists to read translations of Chinese philosophical texts\nwith sensitivity and understanding. Translations of primary and\nsecondary texts and philosophical commentaries thereon have grown\napace, with a multiplicity of exegetical orientations, as have\nliterary, historical, religious, and other studies that collectively\nhave been shrinking the claimed mysteriousness of the East almost to\nthe vanishing point. There are, for instance, over 150 translations in\nEnglish alone of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), and a\ndozen different renditions of the Confucian Analects are in\ncommon use today in courses dealing with Chinese thought. Thus a\npaucity of materials can no longer be used as an excuse for not\nincluding classical Chinese philosophical texts in undergraduate\ncourses, or indeed in the several philosophical discourses now current\nin professional circles. Some rudimentary knowledge of how the\nlanguage works can also be of value to readers in their academic\nstudies and/or participation in these discourses, not least by helping\nthem in understanding and analyzing how and why both translations and\ninterpretations of Chinese philosophical texts can and do differ from\neach other\u2014at times in significant ways, thus enabling them to\nevaluate their readings in the subject matter for themselves. It may\nserve as well to see some contemporary issues in philosophy of\nlanguage, or mind, or in metaphysics from a slightly different\nperspective, and for all these reasons this entry may also serve in a\nsmall way as a \u201cstate of the art\u201d essay on the field.\n", "toc": [{"#ClaChiLanWhaHowWhyDoeItConWhaItCon": "1.

The Classical Chinese Language: What, How, and Why Does It Convey What It Conveys?\n1.1 Chinese Characters\nOdd as these three initial questions may appear, all of them have\nbeen asked and answered differently by Western linguists at one time\nor another. To be sure, much sophisticated work has been done over the\npast century, and there is a general consensus on a variety of\nphonetic, syntactic, and semantic matters. But disputes on an equally\nwide range of other issues are just as numerous, with evidence and\narguments being advanced for incompatible theses about the different\ndimensions of the language(s). Many of these issues have implications\nphilosophers should not ignore when engaged in translation and/or\ninterpretation, and perhaps should not ignore even when working\nclosely only in the contemporary Western philosophical tradition.\nEuropean scholars have been fascinated by the Chinese written\nlanguage since the early Jesuit missionaries to China began writing\nabout it in the late 16th century. A little later Andreas\nMuller claimed to have worked out a \u201ckey\u201d for Chinese in\nthe 1670s, which excited the young Leibniz, already keenly interested\nin all things sinological since at least 1668 (Leibniz WoC: 11\n[1668]). At about the same time Jacob Gohl wrote a book arguing that\nthe language had to have been invented all at once (Duyvendak\n1936). John Webb argued instead that Chinese was the primitive\nlanguage of the human race (1669). Leibniz retained his interest in\nthe language as well as all else having to do with China, but fairly\nearly gave up on the possibility of the written language being the\nbasis of the \u201cUniversal Characteristic\u201d he sought as the\nbasis for reasoning throughout his life (Leibniz WoC: 38 [1679]).\n For the next 150 years the study of the Chinese language was\noverwhelmingly in the hands of missionaries, merchants, and diplomats\nto the \u201cMiddle Kingdom\u201d, amateurs all, with several\ninsights into the language mixed with fanciful speculations about its\norigin, nature, and development. Most of these studies had as their\nmajor goal ascertaining the extent to which Chinese philosophical and\nreligious beliefs were or were not compatible with \u201cthe one true\nfaith\u201d in order for conversion work to go forward.\nComing closer to the present, the disputes about the nature of the\nlanguage are very different than in Leibniz\u2019s day, but almost\nequinumerous, beginning with what to call the characters that comprise\nthe written form. Among the candidates nominated for the title\nare lexigraphs, phonograms, phonic\nindicators, phonoideographs, logographs, \nmorphographs, sinographs, syllabograms,\nand syllabo-phonograms (DeFrancis 1984: 73; the list is not\ncomplete).\n For current purposes it is only necessary to note about this\nnomenclature that its terms divide between emphasizing that the graphs\nconvey sounds (phonetics), which are in the majority, and a minority\nsuggesting the graphs function basically as conveyers of ideas, or\nmeanings, i.e., semantics (hereafter the more general terms\n\u201ccharacters\u201d and \u201cgraphs\u201d will continue to be\nemployed interchangeably). Within the general category of the\ncharacters there are smaller groupings, the names for which have been\ncommonly agreed upon for some time. Three of these smaller groupings\nwe must examine briefly.\nThe total number of characters (individual graphs) in the largest\nChinese dictionaries is a little under 50,000, but less than a fifth\nof those are found with any regularity in the classical texts, and\nstill today a working vocabulary of from 5000 to 7000 graphs is\nconsidered sufficient for all but the most advanced reading. A very\nsmall set of these characters are labelled \u201cpictograms\u201d,\nor \u201cpictographs\u201d, being basically stylized pictures of\nwhat they stand for: \u201ctree\u201d is written \u6728, the sun\n\u65e5, and child, \u5b50. These characters are highly\nstylized now. They better represented what they signified before, but\nwere nevertheless conventional even then, as all characters have been\n(see below).\nThe members of a second, still rather small set of characters are\ngenerally called \u201cideographs\u201d, supposedly representing\nmore abstract ideas incapable of being pictured directly. There are\ntwo subsets here. The first comprises fairly simple and direct graphs:\n\u4e00, \u4e8c , and \u4e09 signify 1, 2, and 3 respectively,\nand \u4e0a and \u4e0b are \u201cabove\u201d and\n\u201cbelow\u201d, or \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d. The\nsecond subset involves less simple and direct graphs, but they do have\nmuch illustrative content. Some famous textbook examples of this\ncategory of ideograms are ming, which combines the pictures\nof the sun \u65e5 and moon \u6708together to signify the Chinese\nword for \u201cbright\u201d, \u660e (as with English, it also\nmeans \u201cintelligent\u201d). Here is a paradigmatic example of\nthe conventionality of the characters. The sun and the moon together\ndo suggest light, illumination, etc. But so would a picture of a\ncandle, or two candles; a fire, or two fires. Many pictures might\nrepresent a word, or concept, and consequently, to some extent at\nleast, using sun and moon together for \u201cbright\u201d is\narbitrary, the signified cannot be determined unambiguously from the\nsignifier alone; it must become conventional.\nTogether, pictographs and ideographs make up less than 10% of all\nChinese characters. Among the remaining 90+%, far and away the most\ncommon are generally referred to as phonetic compounds. These\nare made up of at least two elements, one of which is semantic, or\nmeaning-indicative, and are called significs or, more\nmisleadingly, radicals. The other element in compound graphs\nis the phonetic, or sound-indicative component. Thus the word\nfor \u201cspider\u201d in Chinese (zhu) sounds exactly like\nthe word for \u201cdark red\u201d (burgundy, vermilion), so the\ngraph denoting \u201cspider\u201d contains that color word\n(\u6731). But to indicate the reference more clearly in its written\nform, the graph for \u201cinsect\u201d (\u866b) has been added as\na signific, obtaining the phonetic compound graph\n\u86db, zhu.\nPhonetic compounds do not, however, form a neat and tidy\nset.  Dao\u2014probably the most pregnant character in the\nChinese classical lexicon\u2014has two major components, both of\nwhich are significs in themselves, and neither of which is pronounced\nanything like dao, in either their ancient or modern\nsounds.\nSimilarly, the word wu which means \u201clie\u201d,\n\u201cfalsely accuse\u201d, or \u201cmalicious\u201d is and was\npronounced like the word for \u201cwitch\u201d or\n\u201cshaman\u201d, \u5deb, which became the phonetic component of\nthe word when it took on a written form, with \u201cspeech\u201d,\n\u8a00 added as signific. If we now note that witches were not\ntrustworthy in ancient China we end up with a graph signifying\n\u201cwords of a witch\u201d, \u8aa3\u2014but the graph is listed\nas a phonetic compound, not an ideograph. This example can be\ngeneralized: many so-called \u201cphonetic\u201d elements in complex\nChinese characters also have semantic content, and often are even more\nmeaning-indicative than the signific. Using similarly-sounding words\nto generate new meanings for one or more of them is called\n\u201cparonomasia\u201d (Ames 2008), and at times, homonyms or\nnear-homonyms are used to define a word, a technique used in\nChina\u2019s first dictionary the Shuowen jiezi (ca.\n1st century CE).\nIt probably seems odd that the sounds of a language could\nbe of any import in explicating the philosophies of its speakers:\nFrench certainly sounds different than German, but it is highly\ndoubtful the differences are of any philosophical import. The links\nbetween spoken and written Chinese in the past, however, are more\ntenuous than between French or German, contributing to the written\nlanguage developing a grammar that is sui generis, requiring\nsemantic material on a much larger scale than is common in other\nlanguages. And if the grammars of the spoken and written languages\ndiffer, one must be very careful when considering the relation of\nlanguage to thought in ancient (and to some extent modern) China.\nIn the first place, the Chinese language has only about 400\ndistinct sounds (virtually all characters are single\nsyllable). Because it employs tones\u2014from four to eight depending\non the \u201cdialect\u201d\u2014the sounds may be multiplied to\n1600, but this is still a very small number for developing a\nvocabulary, and of course the sounds are not distributed evenly across\nthe characters. Consequently there are a very large number of homonyms\nin Chinese. In a modern 5000+ dictionary, for example, there are 81\ngraphs pronounced yi, 46 of them in the falling tone; 80\ngraphs are pronounced shi, 15 in the even tone. Anciently\nthere were a number of consonantal endings to the sounds that have\nsince disappeared in most dialects, but even then there would be\nanywhere from 3 to 10 or more different graphs\u2014hence with\ndifferent meanings\u2014pronounced in exactly the same way (Karlgren\n1966).\nWhat this means is that the written language often cannot be\nunderstood when read aloud unless the listeners are already familiar\nwith the passage and what this means in turn is that the written\nlanguage should probably not be seen as a transcription of speech\n(Graham 1987: 390; DeFrancis 1984: 126).\nAll languages have this difficulty with homophones, but those with\nan alphabet have recourse in their written forms to disambiguate the\naural homonymy without a context even though the mechanism is not\nconsistently employed (Cooper 1978: 7). Speakers of English are never\nconfused about the meanings, for example, of \u201cbare\u201d and\n\u201cbear\u201d, or \u201cflower\u201d and \u201cflour\u201d.\n\u201cBear\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d however can cause speakers\nof English trouble without a context that gives them the animal and\nnot the \u201ccarry\u201d reading, or vice versa.\nTo complicate the graph/sound relation still further, there are\nsome graphs that have different meanings when pronounced differently.\n\u6a02, for example, means \u201cmusic\u201d when pronounced\nas yue, \u201cjoy\u201d, \u201cpleasant\u201d, or\n\u201cfind pleasure in\u201d when pronounced as yao, and\n\u201cto enjoy\u201d (intransitive) when pronounced\nas le.\n These communicative difficulties could, however, also be seen as a\nblessing in disguise, for they seem to have given Chinese thinkers two\ndistinct linguistic media for communicating their thoughts and\nfeelings: speaking their native tongue, a natural language, and\nwriting classical Chinese using characters, at least a semi-artificial\nlanguage (but one with great beauty and power to affect readers). Thus\nwhat follows \u201cso-and-so said\u201d in any classical text is\nvery rarely a strict transcription of what the speaker actually said;\ninstead, it very probably indicated in brief form what was\nmeant. Adding a syntactic/stylistic note in this context, one\nscholarly wit has said of the classical language\n \n\nIts telegraphic terseness could reflect ordinary speech only if\nevery Chinese speaker were far more laconic than any Gary Cooper\ncharacter. (Hansen 1992: 34)\n Although the grammar of written classical Chinese differs from the\nlanguage spoken then or now, and it is neither systematic nor\ncomplete, one shouldn\u2019t think it was consciously put together by\nsome particularly clever language-oriented members of the Chinese\nintelligentsia at a particular place and time long ago, as Jacob Gohl\ndid (Duyvendak 1936: 6). Rather is it almost surely a development of\nthe oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty (Keightley\n1978). Thus the written and spoken languages evolved differently over\ncenturies.\nThe spoken language, like all others, was undergoing phonetic\nchange much of the time, which the written form could not reflect\nbecause of its non-alphabetic nature; hence the rise of the use of\nphonetic compounds, of which there were already almost 7000 out of the\n9350+ graphs recorded in the Shuowen. Because the written\nform could no longer reflect the sounds of the spoken there was much\nless incentive to attempt reflecting syntax either, especially when it\nis kept in mind that the spoken language was indeed continually\nundergoing change as well, and that to refer to the differences in\nsounds and sound patterns between them as \u201cdialects\u201d\noverlooks the fact that some of the variants were (and are) as\ndifferent from each other as Italian from German. In this sense to say\n\u201cI speak Chinese\u201d is like saying \u201cI speak\nEuropean\u201d. So the two language forms evolved separately for the\nmost part, the spoken, we may surmise, much more rapidly, both within\nand between regional \u201cdialects\u201d.\n Factors such as these are what must have led at least one\nwell-known sinologist to claim that \u201cThe Chinese characters made\nChinese civilization the culture of the book and not the orator\u201d\n(Creel 1997: 447). This generalization was based in large part on the\nbasis of Creel\u2019s earlier work attempting to show the semantic\nbasis of the majority of the characters, i.e., that they were\nbasically ideographs (1936). Peter Boodberg replied quickly and in\ndetail, offering phonetic explanations for graphs Creel had analyzed\nas semantic (1937). The debate continued, not without acrimony, with a\nresponse from Creel (1938), and a rejoinder from Boodberg (1940). More\nrecently John DeFrancis argued long and hard for the phonetic\ninterpretation of the Chinese script (1984), as did William Hannas,\nwho \nrejected the untenable assumption that Chinese\n characters are \u201cideographic\u201d, that is, relate to meaning\n directly without the intervention of language. (1997:\n 6) \n Chad Hansen challenged this phonetic view (1993), arguing for the\nappropriateness of the semantic emphasis of the graphs on a number of\ncounts, not the least of which was that the Chinese themselves took\nthe graphs to be semantically and not phonetically based, and that\nthey used the ideograph rather than the phonogram as the unit of\nclassification of their dictionaries. He was quickly rebuked for\nengaging in \u201cscientific creationism\u201d (Unger 1993: 949; see\nthe pages following Unger for Hansen\u2019s rejoinder).\nIn addition to the problem of ignoring the Chinese scholars\u2019\nview of their own language, the phonetics-based position suffers from\nthe fact that the graphs do not make for an efficient representation\nof the sounds of the spoken languages. Both DeFrancis and Hannas,\ninsistent on the characters as basically representations of sounds,\nnevertheless admit they do the job \u201cpoorly\u201d (DeFrancis\n1984; Hannas 1997: 1).\nEstablishing the precise nature of the relationship between\nphonetic and the semantic elements of classical Chinese is not an easy\ntask; it is closer and more complex than it may seem at first,\nespecially when we take historical context into account. The earliest\nphilosophers conveyed their views orally, not in written form, with\nthe Confucian Analects as a prime example; more than half the\nentries begin, as above, with \u201cThe Master said\u201d, even when\nwhat follows is paraphrase, unless extremely brief. It is of\nimportance, however, that readers of the Analects always keep\nin mind that the Master was engaged in conversation with his\nstudents. There is a dynamism in the text that is difficult to\nappreciate if it is overread.\nFurther, China\u2019s most revered book of poems is also its\noldest (ca. 8th century BCE), and the poems were and are\ncentrally concerned with sounds and sound patterns (and Confucius\ninsisted his students study it). Moreover, far and away the best means\nof memorizing texts or parts of them is by knowing how to pronounce\nthe graphs in sequential order. Indeed, many works in the canon were\nconsciously rhymed at times during their composition to aid\nmemorization as a philosophical exercise (we will have more to say on\nthis theme in \u00a74.2). On the other hand,\nonce you know that \u201cto lie\u201d is depicted as \u201cthe\nwords of a witch\u201d you will likely not forget it. On the one hand\nagain, over 90% of the characters have a phonetic element in them. But\non the other, the Chinese themselves used semantics and not phonetics\nfor the construction of their dictionary classification system, as\nHansen noted.\nThe place of rhetoric in China is also contested. Like Creel,\nanother well-known sinologist could say \u201cWe know of no early\noratorical tradition in China\u201d (Crump 1964: 36), and a\ncommunications scholar maintains that there was no tradition of\nrhetoric in China (Murphy 1983: 3). Others allow that there was, but\nit was not worth much. To them, \u201cChinese rhetoric is\ncharacterized by harmony, deprecation of speech, and lack of interest\nin logic\u201d (Lu and Frank 1993: 445). Contradicting all of these\nlatter generalizations is a lengthy work entitled Rhetoric in\nAncient China, Fifth to Third Century B.C.E. (Lu 1998).\n Clearly the relation of sound to meaning in classical Chinese is\nnot yet established to the satisfaction of all, linguists,\nsinologists, or otherwise. The issues involved, as we are seeing,\nextend far beyond linguistics normally construed to include problems\nin philosophy\u2014Chinese and Western\u2014and politics. In the\nwords of one contemporary scholar:\n  In the scholarly war over the nature of Chinese\nwriting, while the two sides are engaged in earnest battles, the\nChinese scholars are onlookers, whose views are almost completely\nignored. (Gu 2014: 695)\nThere is more to be said about these matters, but first we must\nconsider briefly what links sound and meaning together in any\nlanguage: syntax.\n1.2 On the Syntax of Classical Chinese\nRoughly speaking, if phonetics/phonology is the study of the\nrelation of words to their sounds, and semantics the relation of words\nto meaning, then syntax is the study of the relation of words to each\nother, which is what we usually think of as grammar. Classical Chinese\nis an isolating language, meaning that each graph stands alone at all\ntimes, in isolation, without affixes of any kind, and unmarked for\ncase, number, gender, or tense. The third-person pronoun ta\ncan be he, him, her, she, it; they, them. And so can the\ngraph qi, \u5176. qu, \u53bb, retains exactly\nthat form for go, going, gone, and went. What follows is that most\nChinese characters can serve equally as both nouns and verbs, and\nmodifiers too (adjectives and adverbs); apart from context no graph\nhas a unique grammatical function. Word order is supposedly fixed,\nbeing Subject-Verb-Object, but so-called nouns regularly default to\nverbs (e.g., \u201crunning is a strenuous exercise\u201d). Style\nalso made the topic subject of the sentence difficult to ascertain, as\nwhen the head noun or object was omitted whenever context made it even\nslightly clear who or what it was.\nNot infrequently the identity of the omitted subject\nwas not clear, even to fairly knowledgeable readers.\nConsider one of the love poems in the Book of Odes about a\nnoblewoman and her knightly lover, translated three different ways.\nFirst, (Legge 1871: 150): \n  \u201cThe cock has crowed The court is\nfull\u201d But it was not the cock that was\ncrowing,\u2014 It was the sound of the blue\nflies.   \nSecond (Waley 1960: 37):\n  The Lady: The cock has crowed; it is full\ndaylight The Lover: It was not the cock that crowed, It\nwas the buzzing of those green flies.   \nThird, (Pound 1954: 45):\n Cock\u2019s crow\u2019d. The courtiers are all\nCrowding the hall.\u2019 Cock hasn\u2019t, she lies But\none hears some blue flies.  \nNow in the first translation, we don\u2019t know who says the cock\nhas crowed. In the second it is the Lady, and in the third, her lover.\nAnd these patterns continue through the remaining stanzas. Clearly the\npoem will be differently understood and enjoyed depending on who we\nthink is saying what. Legge and Waley are very well known translators,\nand if some sinologists arch their eyebrows at including Ezra\nPound\u2019s work\u2014he knew only the rudiments of classical\nChinese when he began it\u2014there are others who admire\nPound\u2019s efforts, especially his translation of\nthe Analects as well as the Odes (Harbsmeier 1990:\n140; for an appreciation of Pound of another kind in this regard, see\nNylan 2014: xxxiii\u2013xl). An equally ubiquitous stylistic rule was\nto employ parallel construction of sentences. At times this proved\nextremely helpful for interpreting opaque sentences, when they\npreceded or followed others structurally the same. But just as often\nvagueness and/or indeterminacy resulted for all save the first\npair.\nThus, while matters of style are formally distinguished from syntax\nin the study of languages, they are neverthless linked closely\ntogether in classical Chinese, making many sentences difficult to\nunderstand even in context. (At times it makes them easier: style,\nespecially parallelism, can at times indicate the best syntactic\nreading of a passage). Overall\u2014especially with its lack of\ninflections\u2014the language can be said to be \u201csyntactically\noverdetermined\u201d in that there may well be a number of\ngrammatically possible ways of interpreting a syntactically generated\nsentence (Fuller 1999: 2; Karlgren 1962). In a number of cases more\nthan one reading will be consistent with the context of the section,\nand/or the entire text. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of\npunctuation in early classical Chinese: no periods, colons,\nsemi-colons, dashes, commas, or parentheses were inserted into texts\nuntil much later, and both then and now you can get very different\nreadings of a text depending on where you place a comma and/or a\nperiod (for example: \u201cJohn thought Marsha was a fool\u201d;\n\u201cJohn, thought Marsha, was a fool\u201d). The written language\ncompensates in part for the lack of punctuation marks by the use of\n\u201cfunction words\u201d, graphs that have little or no meaning on\ntheir own, but serve as grammatical instructions: zhe,\n\u8005, for example, usually nominalizes what precedes\nit; ye, \u4e5f, is a phrase-final marker; hu,\n\u4e4e, concludes sentences to be read interrogatively; and so on. A\nfew other graphs serve as both function words and meaning words. The\ngraph zhi, \u4e4b, is a sign of the genitive. Unfortunately\nfor easy reading, it can also be used as a pronoun, and as another\nword for \u201cto go\u201d. That is to say, it is not always easy to\nsee the syntactic category into which zhi should be placed in\na sentence. Indeed, it has even been maintained that while the focus\nof language in English is the sentence, in classical Chinese it is\ncontext (DeFrancis 1984: 52; Hansen 1992: 34).\nThere is much more to say about the syntax of classical Chinese,\nand the ways in which it does not reflect exactly the syntax of the\nspoken language at any time, but for the purpose of understanding\nissues of translation in Chinese philosophy, we might let the author\nof a contemporary textbook of classical Chinese have the last word\n(Fuller 1999: 2):\n  [T]here may be several perfectly grammatical ways to\nexplain the syntax of a [classical Chinese] sentence. Skill in reading\nlies in deciding which alternative is most likely\u2026 Such\njudgments of meaning cannot be based on grammar alone. They rely not\nonly on a knowledge of grammar, but also on a sense of the larger\narguments of the sentence, the paragraph, and the composition as a\nwhole.\n1.3 On the Semantics of Chinese Characters\nAs we have seen, a few phonetic and a number of syntactic features\nof Classical Chinese, singly or severally, can contribute to\ngenerating a host of possible interpretations of any given passage(s)\nin a text, by allowing for multiply grammatical readings of them. In\nmany if not most of these cases more than one of the readings will be\nconsistent with the context, and in keeping with the principle of\nlogical charity when that principle is applicable. At times semantic\nconcerns can reduce the number of interpretive possibilities of a\nsentence or section, but unfortunately at other times the semantic\ncontent of the characters can increase them. This is a major\nreason why the Daodejing, to take a famous example, is\nimpenetrable to a few, enigmatic to many more, and highly allusive for\neveryone, and has been the subject of well over 150 translations of it\nin English alone, as noted earlier.\nThe opening line of Chapter I reads:\n \u9053 \u53ef \u9053 \u975e \u5e38\n\u9053\nDao ke dao fei chang dao.\n\n\n\u9053(in first,\nthird, and sixth positions here) means \u201cpath\u201d,\n\u201cway\u201d, \u201cthe way\u201d, \u201cto\nfollow\u201d, \u201cto go down a path\u201d. It also means\n\u201cto speak\u201d, \u201cdoctrines\u201d.\n\u53effunctions like\nEnglish modal \u201ccan\u201d.\n\u975ea sign of\nnegation; usually in the sense of \u201cnot the same\nas\u201d.\n\u5e38\u201cunvarying\u201d, \u201cconstant\u201d,\n\u201cenduring\u201d, \u201cunchanging\u201d.\n\nLiterally, then, we have something like \u201cdao\ncan dao not the same as unchanging dao\u201d.\nHere are six translations of this passage, all by reputable\nscholars.\n\n1.\nThe Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying\n    Way. (Waley n.d.: 141)\n2.\nThe way that can be spoken of is not the\n    constant way. (Lau 1963: 57).\n3.\nThe Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring\n    and unchanging Tao. (Legge 1959: 95)\n4.\nA Way that can be followed is not a constant\n    Way. (Ivanhoe 2002: 1)\n5.\nWay-making (dao) that can be put into\n    words is not really way-making. (Ames and Hall 2003:\n    77)\n6.\nAs to a Dao\u2014 If it can be specified\n    as a Dao It is not a permanent Dao. (Moeller 2007:\n    3)\n\nA bit of syntax first. Translations 1\u20134 all take the first\nand third occurrences of dao as nouns, the second as a\nverb. 5 makes verbs of all three, and 6 pretty much makes nouns of all\nthree. Nothing in the original strictly prohibits any of these; the\nultimate determinant of each translation almost surely had more to do\nwith the translator\u2019s interpretation of the text overall than\nwith its language.\nTurning to semantics, while all six translations have family\nresemblances to one another, philosophically the ontological claims\nmade in 1, 2, 4 and 6 are different from 3 and 5 with respect to the\nnature of the dao: in the former, if you can talk\nabout it, it isn\u2019t a (or the) unchanging dao; whereas\nin 3 and 5 the claim is that if you can walk (tread, follow)\nthe (or a) dao it isn\u2019t a (or the)\nunchanging dao. The articles in parentheses are also of\nontological import here:\n\u201ca\u201d dao is surely different from\n\u201cthe\u201d dao (there are no articles in\nChinese). Four of the translators had\n\u201cway\u201d/\u201ctao\u201d/\u201cdao\u201d grow capital\nletters, presumably to tell the reader something more than would be\nconveyed by using lower case (impossible in the original, of course).\nBut what exactly is it that is being conveyed?\nDao is by no means the only character with such different\nmeanings, although it is a special case. De, \u5fb7, has\nthe same multiplicity of them: \u201cvirtue\u201d,\n\u201cpower\u201d, \u201cexcellence\u201d, \u201cforce\u201d,\n\u201cconduct\u201d, \u201ccharisma\u201d. And so do many other\ngraphs of philosophical import. At the same time, many other graphs do\nnot have meanings different enough to cause philosophical problems of\ninterpretation.  Fa, \u6cd5, entries, for example, include\n\u201claw\u201d, \u201cregulation\u201d, \u201cmethod\u201d,\n\u201cpattern\u201d, where the general meaning of fa is\nfairly clear, or at least clear enough that any of the English terms\ncould normally be used to translate it without undue loss of meaning,\nor philosophical distortion.\nReturning now to the first line of the Daodejing, all six\nof the translators can proffer good reasons for choosing the English\nwords they used; their translations are consistent with Chinese syntax\nand semantics, but without context it is impossible to ascertain which\nmeaning the author of the sentence intended; indeed, we don\u2019t\nknow which of the several contributors to the text wrote the first\nline. The principle of logical charity is no help in this\ncase\u2014assume that the author(s) do not contradict\nthemselves\u2014because the Daodejing is notorious for being\nparadoxical: Chapter 56 begins: \u201cThose who know do not speak;\nThose who speak do not know\u201d, which is clearly intentional, and\nrhetorically efficacious despite its logical invitation to a charge\nof tu quoque. It thus makes no sense at all to ask which of\nthe six translations is the correct one, or even\nthe best one, except on the basis of an interpretation of the\ntext as a whole, all six of which currently on offer herein contest\nthe others. Indeed there is a high probability that the author of the\nline intended the ambiguity attendant on the construal\nof the second dao, in which case it becomes impossible to\ngive the correct translation in English. One long-time student of\nearly Daoism summed up the matter succinctly: \u201cReading [it] is\nan act of creation\u201d (Welch 1971:\n11). We will return to\nthe theme of ambiguity\u2014both syntactic and\nsemantic\u2014in \u00a74.2.\nIf the student new to the study of Chinese philosophy takes away\none idea from this brief summarization of a complex set of\ninterconnected linguistic issues focusing on texts, perhaps the most\nfruitful one would be that the writing of philosophy in classical\nChinese affects the philosophy written in a number of ways that call\ninto question the unquestioned assumption that writing is simply\ntranscribed speech, relatively unaffected by its means of\ntransmission. This is a dubious idea for any language, but especially\nsuspect with classical Chinese. Consider the following from Michael\nNylan, writing about the compositions of the Han Dynasty\nscholar-official and author Yang Xiong (53 BCE\u201318 CE):\n\nPhrases replete with reduplicatives, verbal alliteration and\n  rhymes would have delighted the tongue and the ears. The eye would\n  have been attracted by the dance of the black ink graphic patterns\n  on the silk scroll or bamboo bundle, especially where there was\n  visual alliteration. (Nylan 2011: 63)\n\nA second useful idea to retain would be that relatively few issues\nof translation of early Chinese texts can be resolved once for all on\nlinguistic grounds alone. Even judging better from worse readings\nalmost always hinges more on the interpretation given to the text by\nthe interpreter and/or translator, and the purpose(s) for which the\ntranslation was done, topics to which we will now turn. We will begin\nwith some issues that are of import both in contemporary Western\nphilosophy and for the student of Chinese thought, following which we\nwill concentrate directly on the latter.\n2. Metaphysical Issues\n2.1 Can Machines Think in Chinese Rooms?\n As we begin to address the major issues and problems in the\ninterstices between translation and interpretation a major problem\narises immediately, for some scholars would claim that there are no\nsuch issues or problems: translations and interpretations are, and\nshould be kept distinct. Many proponents of machine translation and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI ) are prime examples of this orientation,\nand the field has become far more sophisticated than in the days when\nthe term \u201chydraulic ram\u201d in an article on dam construction\ncame out \u201cwater buffalo\u201d in the Russian. Many advances\nhave been made in the purely linguistic dimensions of mechanical\ntranslation, enough, obviously, to maintain at least minimal\nplausibility for the claim of distinctness between the two endeavors,\nespecially because of the rising number of users of automatic\ntranslation on their laptops. But as those users also realize, when\nthe text to be translated exceeds the phrase level by much, context\nmust enter in to achieve correct outcomes. In context,\nKhrushchev\u2019s famous \u201cWe will bury you\u201d at the\nU.N. translated fairly literally a Russian colloquialism for which the\nEnglish equivalent would almost surely have been \u201cWe will leave\nyou in the dust\u201d (he was talking about the difference between\nplanned and market economies at the time). Had the U.N. interpreter\nheeded context, the Cold War might have been less chilling, and thus\nperhaps less dangerous.\n With classical Chinese context is almost always essential for\ntranslation, making some interpretation equally\nnecessary. This may be a low level of interpretation, of course;\nsimply ascertaining the correct subject of a sentence where no subject\nis present, or inferring a verb from a prior occurrence, without going\ninto any metaphysical speculations. We should note in passing,\nhowever, that this Chinese example does not automatically refute the\nmachine translation claim of the separateness of the two efforts of\ntranslation and interpretation. If it is indeed the case that\nclassical Chinese is not a close transcription of speech (which it\nisn\u2019t), but embodies a grammar (which it pretty much does), it\ncan be argued that it is thus at least somewhat not a natural language\nin the way Natural Language Processing scholars use the term for\nwritten documents they work with, and hence not a genuine\ncounterexample to the AI claim.\n This issue bears directly on another well known philosophical\ncontroversy. In 1980 John Searle published his famous \u201cChinese\nRoom Argument\u201d (Searle 1980). He was attempting to counter the\nAI claim that computers could be said to be intelligent\u2014could\nthink, had minds\u2014if they could pass the \u201cTuring\nTest\u201d (Turing 1950). His argument was that the Turing test was\ninadequate for establishing computer intelligence, conducting a\nthought experiment in which a person placed in a room with an\nappropriate computer program, could \u201cread\u201d strings of\nsymbols (Chinese characters) slid under the door into the computer,\nand the program would generate an appropriate symbolic response, hence\npass the \u201cTuring Test\u201d for intelligence even though the\nperson at the computer didn\u2019t recognize a single Chinese\ngraph. The \u201ctest\u201d was that if 70% of the people (later\nreduced to 30%) who engaged in the keyboard exchanges for five minutes\ncould not tell the AI responses from those of a native Chinese\nspeaker, the machine was intelligent.\n A vast literature has grown up around the \u201cChinese Room\nArgument\u201d, in the philosophy of mind and related areas, which it\nwould take us too far afield to consider herein. But we should note\nthat Searle\u2019s example presupposes that it is modern spoken\nChinese that is being recorded, not the classical language. In the\nformer, the parts of speech can normally be established by syntax\nalone, surely an asset in sorting out semantic elements\nappropriately. But the classical language always requires context to\nmake clear the grammatical function of a graph, and it will surely be\na long time (if ever) before any program could include not only the\nsyntax, but all of the contexts necessary for correctly\n\u201creading\u201d the semantics of the sentence(s).  Establishing\ncontext requires common sense, which computers remain notorious for\nlacking.\nReplacement tests for Turing\u2019s based on common sense are now\nbeing worked on, (Levesque, et al. 2012), and a future work may allow\nappropriate exchanges in classical Chinese to pass such a test. But\nuntil then Searle\u2019s conclusion about the inseparability of\ntranslation and interpretation will continue to have force, and we can\nget on with the issues and problems attendant on the links between\nthem in Chinese Philosophy as they impinge on contemporary\nmetaphysical concerns.\n2.2 On a Very Different Idea of Conceptual Schemes\nIn 1973 Donald Davidson published an influential paper claiming,\nnuances aside, that the idea of cognitive relativism\u2014with truth\nrelative to particular conceptual schemes\u2014was incoherent.\nDavidson\u2019s argument hinges on his rejection of what he calls\n\u201cThe third dogma of empiricism\u201d, namely, that we can\nmeaningfully distinguish conceptual schemes from an uninterpreted\nreality\u2014taken as \u201ca neutral ground\u201d or\n\u201ccoordinate system\u201d\u2014by means of which we could\ncompare and contrast differing conceptual schemes. He says:\n  In giving up dependence on the concept of an\nuninterpreted reality \u2026we do not relinquish the concept of\nobjective truth\u2014quite the contrary. Given the dogma of a dualism\nof scheme and reality, we get conceptual relativity, and truth\nrelative to a scheme.  Without the dogma, this kind of relativity goes\nby the board. Of course truth of sentences remains relative to\nlanguage, but that is as objective as can be. (Davidson 1973:\n20)\nAngus Graham rejected Davidson\u2019s claim, saying that the\npostulation of conceptual schemes different from our (modern Western)\none was \u201cinescapable\u201d for scholars of the language and\nthought of other cultures, and indeed, \u201cthat the very idea was\nan indispensable tool for such inquirers, to which Davidson\u2019s\nobjections did not directly apply.\u201d (Graham 1992: 59).\nThe idea that truth might be relative to a conceptual\nscheme, however, was as abhorrent to Graham as it was incoherent to\nDavidson. To be sensitive to the differing thought patterns of another\nculture while yet not descending into philosophical unintelligibility\nor epistemological chaos Graham argued that languages not having a\ncommon ancestor will seldom have synonymous terms in their lexicons,\nand consequently many sentences in such languages (i.e., English and\nChinese) will not be fully intertranslatable because they do not\nexpress the same proposition (1992: 65). He can thus hold to a\nconception of truth by claiming that \u201cif a true\nstatement does have a translation equivalent \u2026 the latter will\nbe true as well\u201d (1992: 68).\nThe major problem with Davidson\u2019s account is that he\nconstrues \u201cconceptual schemes\u201d as sets of propositions, on\nthe basis of which he is claiming that there can only be one such true\nset. But as we have already begun to see\u2014and will see more\nof\u2014from the example of Chinese philosophy written in classical\nChinese, the Chinese concern is much more with naming, syntax, and\nwhat we might call \u201cwritten rhetoric\u201d\u2014composing\npersuasive ideas and transmitting them for effect both visually and\naurally\u2014rather than truth in the propositional sense (for which\nthere is no close lexical equivalent in Chinese). Hansen has gone the\nfarthest with this claim throughout his major work: \u201c\u2026\nlanguage is a social practice. Its basic function is guiding\naction\u201d (1992: 3).\nIndeed, for Graham and others the acceptance of the idea of\ndiffering conceptual schemes to explain different vocabularies and\nsyntactic patterns is one important reason that makes the study of\nChinese philosophy interesting, so long as we also treat the different\nschemes as equals and not treat one as in any way inferior to the\nother. Seen as equals, it then becomes\n  \u2026 possible to use one to criticize something\nin another, as Fingarette uses Confucius to undermine our inner/outer\ndichotomy, Rosemont the problematic of moral choice, Hall and Ames the\nconcept of transcendence. (Graham 1992: 78)\nWe will be inclined to think of conceptual schemes as either true\nor false if they are seen as systems of propositions as Davidson is\nimplying, but we can also view them as \u201ca pre-logical pattern of\nnames \u2026 as the product of the classifying act of naming\u201d,\naccording to Graham (1992: 68). And this is a proper area of study for\nlinguists, sinologists and philosophers; indeed, for Graham and many\nothers it is an area necessary to study for discussing\nsimilarities and differences cross-culturally with any precision or\nclarity (1992: 69).\n There is, however, another dimension of Davidson\u2019s position\nthat is also connected directly to his concern with propositional\ntruth as the locus of a \u201cconceptual scheme\u201d, but connected\nin another way.\n2.3 The Hypothesis of the Relativity of Linguistics\nThat idea can and does also refer to an overall way of being in and\nresponding to one\u2019s world, which has been an important topic in\nphilosophy and linguistics since Benjamin Lee Whorf, who along with\nhis teacher Edward Sapir developed what has come to be known as the\nSapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity.  Stated simply the\nthesis is that the way human beings perceive and describe the world in\nwhich they live is a function of the structure of the native\nlanguage(s) they acquire to describe and interact with it.  In\nWhorf\u2019s words,\n \n\u2026[T]he grammar of each language is not\n merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is\n itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the\n individual\u2019s mental\u2026development. (1956: 212)\n \nThere is a \u201cstrong\u201d version of the hypothesis, namely,\nthat the language structures determine the conceptual map we\nemploy in negotiating our world, and a weaker version that those\nstructures influence construction and use of the map, or to\nreturn to Davidson\u2019s language, the \u201cconceptual\nscheme\u201d. Relatively few people subscribe to the strong version\nof the hypothesis, but the weaker formulation has many adherents. For\nthinking about translation issues, however, it is useful to note that\nthe standard objection to the strong interpretation of Whorf\u2019s\nclaim is that if it was correct, he wouldn\u2019t be able to give\nexamples of it. Davidson (among others), argues that Whorf endeavors\nto describe the alien metaphysics of the Hopi, based on their\nlanguage, using, of course, English (Davidson 1973: 5). Mandelbaum\ndoes the same for Whorf\u2019s account of Apache and Shawnee (1979:\n67). The point of the objection in both cases is that major\ndifferences between languages in what they identify or call our\nattention to notwithstanding, they may all be described in a single\nlanguage.\nBut that is not the point that a strong version of Whorf\nemphasizes. As Graham argued,\n \nWhorf would hardly have denied that bilingual\nreaders would be clearer about the divergence with an equally\nsophisticated Hopi account to compare with his. (1992: 68)\n \nOf course we can give an account of different patterns of syntax\nand naming\u2014not different truths\u2014between languages, in a\nsingle language; that is what field linguists do, and increasingly,\ncomparative philosophers. Given that the 47 Eskimo words for\n\u201csnow\u201d has been exposed as a hoax (Pullum 1991: 166) we\nmust take another example of the Whorfian orientation and its\nimplications. In China, native speakers do not seem to have\ngrandparents or siblings simpliciter. Rather do they have\nindividual lexical items for mother\u2019s father, mother\u2019s\nmother, father\u2019s father, father\u2019s mother; and until the\none child policy went into effect they had younger brothers and older\nbrothers, and the same for sisters. Many of them will also use\ndistinguishing kin names for other elders with whom they stand in a\nrelation, whereas English makes do with generic \u201caunt\u201d and\n\u201cuncle\u201d. There is nothing at all mysterious here, nor any\nquestion of truth: the Chinese simply have many more and specific\nkinship terms than English speakers.\nA more complicated if not mysterious situation obtains, however,\nwhen we shift from simple naming to matters more syntactic. Graham\nagain (1992: 78):\n  Since the interrogative words of different languages\nare not synonymous, and connect with their syntactic structures, it\nseems inevitable that Aristotle or anyone else asking questions with\nthem will be categorizing along lines initially set by the language in\nwhich he thinks.\n Appreciating the full significance of what Graham is saying here\nfor issues of translation and interpretation is difficult at first,\nfor the very simple reason that the Aristotelian categories are quite\nfamiliar to students of Western philosophy, having been conveyed to\nthem in translations from the Greek into English; therefore the\ninterrogatives of Greek won\u2019t seem all that foreign to us, and\nwe feel fairly confident that we can read and understand Aristotle\npretty much as he intended to be read.\nThus, if we think only in terms of translating into or out of our\nnative tongue, and draw all our examples therefrom, many of\nthe more general linguistic and conceptual difficulties\nattendant on the work of translation and textual exegesis elude our\nunderstanding against the Whorfian perspective. To see what is at\nstake, let us suppose that a South Asian philosopher wished to\ntranslate Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason into Sanskrit.\nAt first blush it appears that there will be a fair amount of semantic\noverlap in the vocabularies (perhaps not entirely surprising, both\nGerman and Sanskrit being Indo-European languages). For the dual\nnature of the world, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra can work very well\nfor phenomena (the world of experience), and the non-negative\ndimensions of nirvana can stand duty for noumenal\n(The world beyond, of which we cannot speak or know directly). The\nfits are not exact, but close.  Maya\napproximates Erscheinungswelt (the world of appearances),\nand dharma seems to embody pretty well Kant\u2019s\noverarching concern with the concept of duty, especially\nsince dharma also means and is closely bound up with\n\u2019law,\u2019 matching Kant\u2019s linking of duty and (moral)\nlaw.\nThese semantic parallels are not inconsequential,\nbut it is highly unlikely that by utilizing a Sanskrit vocabulary\nKant\u2019s philosophy is going to come through a translation at all\nclearly. What, for example, to do with karma? It does not\nappear in the Critique or in any of Kant\u2019s other\nwritings. The Hindu Sanskritist, however, might believe that every\nrational person had an idea of karma even though it might not\nalways be explicit beyond the confines of Indian civilization, and\ntherefore feel justified in attributing the concept to\nKant implicitly, and get on with his translation and\nexegesis. Of course for us this will not do; it is incredible that the\nconcept of karma played any role whatsoever in Kant\u2019s\nthinking. But if this be admitted, then the employment of the other\nterms adumbrated above becomes suspect, for their meanings are linked\nintimately not only to each other, but\nto karma. The dharma of each of us is determined by\nour karma, the chains of which, speaking figuratively, we\nmust break if we are to escape samsara\nfor nirvana.\n Thus Whorf seems to require translators and interpreters\u2014of\nnon-Indo-European language materials in particular\u2014to think\nabout how best to explicate abstract classifications based on\ngrammatical categories and lexical items not found in one of the\nlanguages under study. But in addition to the conceptual, it is also\nimperative to think carefully about how best to explicate the\nexperiential sense of being in the world among speakers of very\ndifferent languages. Returning to our earlier example of kin terms,\nthe Whorfian orientation suggests we might ask whether or how young\nChinese are or are not situated in their families differently than\ntheir American cousins, owing to the difference in the specificity of\nthe relations in which they stand and speak with their kin.\nThat is to say, the Whorfian hypothesis does not have to be\nconstrued as having to do solely, or even mainly with truth\nconditions, but rather with human experiences as they are\nmolded by the languages people speak that affect the contexts of their\nexperiences. This is what seems to be the point of the Whorfian\nhypothesis: there are very different ways we may describe and be in\nthe world we inhabit jointly, but experience differently because of\nour language and cultural determinants, and thus describe in ways that\nmay not be altogether intertranslatable with a language that molded\ndifferent experiences for its speakers.\nThus the translator and exegete must struggle to convey the ways of\nbeing in the world the authors of their texts indicate in their\nwritings, and learn how to get around the problems caused by the fact\nthat not all passages from the Chinese classical texts are fully\nintertranslatable into English. It is an important struggle which few\ntranslators have engaged in, but must begin to tackle if the charge of\na Eurocentric bias in Chinese philosophy is ever going to be fully met\n(see \u00a73.4, below).\nConceptual relativism does not follow from these claims. It would\nfollow only if two languages were fully intertranslatable, but that a\ntrue statement in one turned out to be false in the other; so far no\nplausible examples of this possibility have been advanced. Thus truth\nconditions \u00e0 la Davidson should not be of direct\nconcern in these contexts\u2014but will be in the consideration of\nhow to deal with incommensurability with respect to exegetical\nmethodologies, to which we will turn\nin \u00a74.1.\n3. Why Interrogate Chinese Philosophical Texts?\n3.1 Introduction\nThere are almost as many answers to this question as there are\ncomparative philosophers working in the field of Chinese thought.\nHerein we may cover only a few of them as illustrative of more general\ntrends and tendencies. Moreover, the reader must bear in mind that a\ngreat many translations and accounts of Chinese philosophy have been\nand still are made by non-philosophers, adding more answers to the\nquestion of why the texts are deemed worthy of interrogation than can\nbe taken up herein.\nDespite the multiplicity of appropriate responses to the questions,\nhowever, the reasons for asking them basically reduce to two, and they\nhold not only for Chinese writings, but all foreign philosophical\ntexts. We translate and interpret them in order to 1) learn more about\nthe people in the culture whence the text came; and/or 2) to learn\nmore about ourselves and our own culture. That is to say, most texts\nworthy of translation and exegesis are both windows on the culture\nthat produced them and mirrors of our own.\nThere are numerous ways these goals can be achieved individually,\nand together, depending on the nature of the approach to the\ntexts. First we will examine briefly the interrogation of Chinese\ntexts against the background of the problems, patterns of\nargument and standards of rational justification in the Western\nphilosophical tradition; its \u201cgrammar\u201d, so to speak\n(Makeham 2012: xii). The governing idea is that although surely\ndifferent, Chinese thinkers have enough in common with their Western\ncounterparts to make associative and contrastive comparisons between\nthem and/or their ideas a useful method of engagement with the\ntext.\nThen, in the following section (3.3) the\ntexts are interrogated a little differently, with the governing idea\nbeing something like a \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d in\nreverse. With this approach the \u201cgrammar\u201d of the Western\nphilosophical tradition is downplayed to the extent possible, the\nexegetes and translators believing that it distorts the Chinese\nmaterials by overwriting them with distinctly Western concerns; we\nshould not look for theodicean writings in a culture without a concept\nof an all-good creator God. Instead of asking \u201cTo what extent do\nthese texts suggest answers to philosophical questions that vex\nus?\u201d they tend to ask \u201c To what extent do these texts\nsuggest we might ask different philosophical questions?\u201d\nFinally, in \u00a73.4 we will sketch quickly\nthe problematik of Chinese philosophers in China, and how and\nwhy it overlaps only slightly at present with the Western\napproaches.\n3.2 The Comparative Approach\n For the great majority of Anglophone and European comparative\nphilosophers of China the Western philosophical heritage is the basis\nfor the comparisons. This may or may not be regrettable, but is in\nsome measure unavoidable because it is obviously the more familiar\ntradition and the ground of the comparativist\u2019s views. It is\nhard to imagine any scholar essaying a translation of a text without\nsome knowledge of what it\u2019s about, and its importance, and for\nphilosophers that \u201caboutness\u201d and the importance stem from\nconceptions drawn from the translator\u2019s own philosophical\ntraining, which is the kernel from which the interpretation will\ngrow. Obviously close and careful readings of the text can\nalter\u2014perhaps significantly\u2014the original interpretation\ngiven to it, but an interpretation of some kind we tend to have at all\ntimes when working with a Chinese classical text (or any other).\nSome texts wear their interpretations pretty much on their sleeves;\nit is hard to interpret the \u201cLegalist\u201d Hanfeizi\ntext as a Confucian treatise because of the extent to which it is a\ncriticism thereof, championing a system of regulations and laws that\nwas an anathema to The Master. Most Chinese classical texts are not,\nhowever, of this kind, as we should already expect from our earlier\ndiscussion about the classical language. They require a good deal of\ninterpretive analysis and evaluation. Almost none of them are pure,\nthe work of a single author and unaffected by the vagaries of history\nor the ravages of time. They are composites, with fragments of several\ntexts often strung together by we-know-not who, then burned in large\nquantities during the bibliographic holocaust of 213 BCE and the\ndestruction of the libraries during the civil war that followed soon\nafterward; with remaining copies re-assembled\u2014again by the\nnameless\u2014and that is pretty much the way they have come down to\nus. Greater understanding of several texts has come from unearthing\nvery old copies of them written on bamboo or silk at recently\nexcavated archaeological sites, particularly those at Mawangdui in\nHunan and Guodian in Hubei; but it remains that virtually every work\nwe have today is more or less corrupt.\n The composite nature of most texts also means there can be no tidy\nclassification system for them either, nor even for their parts at\ntimes: labelling this chapter of a text Daoist, or Mohist, and that\none more or less Confucian ignores the fact that there were a large\nnumber of ideas current in the classical period, with different\nthinkers adopting and adapting them in different ways. We may speak of\nlineages\u2014the followers of a particularly gifted\nteacher\u2014but few scholars any longer think of clear and distinct\nphilosophical \u201cschools\u201d.\nOne highly composite text\u2014both ideologically and\ntemporally\u2014is the Analects of Confucius, a long string\nof abbreviated statements by or about Confucius and his students, not\nput into its present form until at least two centuries after he died\nin 479 BCE (Kim and Csikszentmilhalyi 2014). Most translations and\nexegeses of the text place great emphasis on his ethics, and those of\nhis successors, especially Mencius. They have been interpreted against\nthe background of consequentialism (Im 2011); Christianity (Legge\n1871); Kantian (many mainland scholars ever since Liang Qichao and his\nstudent Mou Zongsan a century ago); as virtue ethics, Aristotelian and\notherwise (most comparativists working in the field today; see Tiwald\n2010); as Character ethicists (Kupperman 2004); as one among several\n\u201cnatural moralities\u201d (Wong\n2006); or their views\nhave been addressed against the background of differing strands of\nfeminist ethics (Raphals 1998; Li 2000; Wang 2003; Rosenlee 2007).\n It would be a mistake to ask which of these readings of\nthe Analects or the early Confucians in general is\nthe correct one. In the first place, we must note that all of the\nethical theories save one are Western, and the questions focus on\nwhich one best fits with early Confucian writings. Even more\nbasically, the concept of ethics as a delimitable field of\nphilosophy is itself Western, not Chinese, which problematizes\neven more the question of \u201ccorrectness\u201d. Consequently the\ntranslator/exegete must constantly guard against reading out of the\ntext simply what he or she has read into it. Rather obviously\nConfucius and his successors could not hold all these ethical\npositions, and perhaps they didn\u2019t hold any of them, or any\nethical theory at all. Thus all these interpretations can\u2019t\npossibly be right, and more probably they are all of them wrong in at\nleast some respects.\nIndeed, perhaps even to suggest right and wrong is wrong here. If\nthe reader wants only to know what the statements in\nthe Analects originally meant to those who first heard them\nthen all these philosophical readings must be suspect in some\ndegree. A more purely narrative and less analytic/evaluative approach\nis called for.  Asking how much like Aristotle the sayings of Mencius\nmay be is different from ascertaining how King Liang heard them when\nMencius supposedly first spoke to him.\nAnswering the latter question is more often done by sinologists\nwith disciplinary training other than philosophy, in which the issues\nare more philological, etymological and historical (see Brooks and\nBrooks 2001), but a number of philosophers have well served the\nprofession by focusing heavily on the translation rather than\nexegetical side of comparative work, saving their exegetical remarks,\nif any, for introductions or notes (an older example is\nD.C. Lau\u2019s Tao Te Ching (1963), a newer one Eric\nHutton\u2019s Xunzi (2014)). Again, textual problems arising\nfrom this kind of activity tend to be more philological and historical\nthan exegetical or philosophical, even though the texts are basically\nphilosophical.\n Both questions, however, are important ones with respect to\ntranslation and textual exegesis, for both can generate significant\ninsights. Asking whether Confucius may be legitimately construed as a\ncloset consequentialist, or feminist, can enlarge the reader\u2019s\nview of these ethical orientations, as well as illumine a number of\ndimensions of the Master\u2019s views. On the other hand, striving to\ngive an account of a thinker or group of them at the time they lived\nallows readers more conceptual room to form their own judgements about\nthe value of the views in the translation and/or exegesis.\n We may see the same points with another type of comparative\ntextual scholarship done philosophically, examining similarities and\ndifferences between a specific Chinese and a specific Western\nthinker. One might take two intellectual giants from their cultures\nand juxtapose them, like Aristotle and Confucius (Sim 2007; Yu 2007;\nIvanhoe 2014). Or investigate how much like Kierkegaard\u2019s\nanti-rationalist reaction to Hegel is Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism\nabout reason (Carr and Ivanhoe 2000). Or choose two disparate\nthinkers, and employ new comparative practices to elucidate some\nostensibly similar concepts in differing cultural contexts (Yearley\n1990).\n What can be learned from such studies? Taking the\nAristotle/Confucius comparisons, we learn just how much weight\nConfucius gave to rituals, family, customs and traditions as\nprerequisite for flourishing personal lives and social harmony, for\nexample. The weight grows even heavier when we reflect that Aristotle\nsaid almost nothing about rituals, family, customs and traditions,\nthough he dealt in great detail with great sensitivity in virtually\nall aspects of human life personal and social.  By his silence on\nritual matters he obliges us to look at Confucius\u2019s insistence\non those dimensions of human life again.  He was deeply\nconcerned with ritual performance; why?\nIn the same way we may obtain new insights into Aristotelianism:\nthere are libraries full of commentaries on the writings of Aristotle\ngathered over the past two millennia, but it is doubtful that any of\nthem commented on the significance of the absence of any concern with\nritual matters in those writings. By placing Confucius alongside him\nthe lacunae quickly becomes obvious, and invites our\ncontemplation.\nAnother dimension of the comparative approach involves focusing on\na specific audience for the comparativist\u2019s translation work and\ncommentary. If we believe the Mozi resembles Utilitarianism\nin many respects for instance, the writings of Bentham and Mill can\nserve well as the interpretive framework for our efforts. The specific\nsyntactic patterns and lexical items we employ, however, plus notes\nand commentary, will be somewhat different if we are basically writing\nfor a general audience of undergraduates or the general reader than if\nwe are trying to engage other philosophers of a Utilitarian persuasion\nin dialogue about the contribution(s) the Mohist views can\nmake to the further sophistication of the views of Bentham and Mill\n(Angle 2014: 229). And with only minor caveats, the same may be said\nfor exegeses of the text in comparative contexts.\n Many comparative philosophers also do strict exegeses no less than\ncomparative ones, focusing on simply explicating, against a\nphilosophical background, the dominant views of a person,\n\u201cschool\u201d, text or concept.  Examples of each are Leo\nChang\u2019s The Philosophical Foundations of Han Fei\u2019s\nPolitical Theory (1986); Daoism Explained, by Hans-Georg\nMoeller (2011); Heaven, Earth and Man in the Book of Changes,\nby Hellmut Wilhelm (1977); and Ironies of Oneness and Difference:\nCoherence in Early Chinese Thought by Brook Ziporyn (2013).\n3.3 The Contrastive Approach\n The comparative approach to exegesis in Chinese philosophy\nobviously leaves much room for consideration of differences as well,\nwhich are often as illuminating as the similarities, and at times even\nmore so. This approach also tends to enrich philosophy overall by\nincreasing its scope, reach, and capacity for self-correction; there\nis no better cure for culture-boundedness than steeping oneself in\nanother.  And in that way\u2014as well as many\nothers\u2014comparative philosophers of China may hope to engage in\nfruitful dialogue with other philosophers ignorant of non-Western\ncultures in general, Chinese in particular.\nAll of these laudable consequences of the comparative approach\nnotwithstanding, there is another way to interrogate Chinese texts\nwhich merits attention because it is equally capable of illuminating\nthem. This latter approach places the Western tradition more in the\nbackground while engaged in research, interpretive and translation\nefforts. That is to say, the translating philosopher must be open to\nthe text as it is, not within the contexts determined by the nature of\nthe questions addressed to it in the vocabulary of Western philosophy.\nThis critical stance is not urging philosophers to approach a text as\na tabula rasa, for such cannot be done. It is to urge that\nphilosophers attend very carefully to the lexicon for translating\nChinese into English, for that lexicon may be construed as\na theory of sorts, and an increasingly poor one; it is a\ntheory that Chinese philosophy is pretty much like Western philosophy,\nand consequently the vocabulary of the one can be carried over to the\nother without undue distortion (Hansen 1992: 17).\nBut no translation is innocent, nor any interpretation. The form of\nour questions determine the range of the possible answers we can\nobtain. Thus, if we ask what view of the inner life Confucius held, we\nalmost surely will not be able to see that perhaps he didn\u2019t\nhold any such view, or even think about having an \u201cinner\nlife\u201d, as Herbert Fingarette argued in his famous book on the\nMaster (1972). Asking which theory of propositional truth early\nDaoists held makes it difficult to see, as Hansen argued, that the\nearly Daoists (and all other early Chinese thinkers) had little\ninterest in propositional truth, but in language as praxis-guiding\nbehavior, as we noted earlier\n(\u00a72.2, and will take up again\nin \u00a74.3 ). There are multiple\ncosmologies in Western philosophy, beginning with the several put\nforth by the Greeks, all of them conforming to a logical order. But we\nshouldn\u2019t ask which one of them early Chinese cosmology most\nnearly resembles if Hall and Ames are right in claiming that Chinese\ncosmology is best described as an aesthetic order not a\nlogical one (1987: 16). It might be that the early Confucians\ndidn\u2019t have any ethical theory, but based their\ndescriptions, analyses and evaluations of human activity on the basis\nof their roles (Rosemont and Ames 2009; Ames 2011; Rosemont 2015).\nThese suggestions clearly do not fit well with the standard\n\u201cgrammar\u201d and presuppositions of the Western philosophical\ntradition. It makes no sense to ask what contribution Chinese thought\ncan make to the mind-body problem if the dichotomy is altogether\nabsent their writings, nor to seek light on the nature of\npropositional truth if its propositional content was not a factor in\ntheir thinking about language.\nOne problem with this approach to interrogating Chinese texts is\nthat it thus reduces the opportunities for comparative philosophers to\nengage in genuine dialogue with their Western-oriented brethren, and\nmakes it easier to continue using the shibboleth that Chinese thought\n\u201cisn\u2019t really philosophy\u201d. On the other hand, the\ncontrasters will insist that the comparative approach robs the Chinese\nof their own voice, forcing them into a philosophical milieu that is\nnot theirs. This can be seen in the frequency with which the\ncomparisons tend to be asymmetrical: when something is lacking, or an\nargument missing, or some other deficit is seen, the Chinese side is\nat fault. But the plausibility of the charge rests almost solely on\nassuming the Western definition of the problem and approach to it. And\nin the end, just how plausible is it to think that all\nthe real problems of philosophy, and all the methods for\ndealing with them, have been advanced in a single civilization?\nThese sketches of the comparative and contrastive approaches to the\nexegesis of Chinese philosophical texts have been just that: sketches;\nthere are many more examples of each kind, and a number of comparative\nphilosophers combine the two. And it must be remembered that much work\nhas been done by scholars not trained in philosophy, increasing the\nnumber of ways of approaching the texts. Good exemplars of the variety\nof approaches to the field are introductory works on Chinese\nphilosophy, which tend to combine both some comparative and\ncontrastive elements, and differ in thrust as their authors foreground\nthe Chinese elements, or emphasize philosophy\n(especially analytic) in their narratives. Two examples of the former\nare Lai (2008) and Wen (2012); coming down more firmly on the\nphilosophy side are Van Norden (2011) and Liu (2006). The field is\nthus fairly fluid as it continues to come into its own, which readers\nshould celebrate and not bemoan because of the variety of perspectives\non the Chinese tradition on offer, all based on solid scholarly work\nfrom one discipline or another. We shall return briefly to these\nissues in \u00a74.3.\n3.4 The Chinese Approach\n Chinese scholars working in the field of Chinese philosophy have\nmuch in common with their Western peers, but the differences are even\ngreater, at least at present. In the first place, with few exceptions\nthe Chinese would not see themselves as comparativists. They will read\nclosely comparative works on Aristotle and Confucius, but basically\nfor what they can learn about the latter, not the former. This is not\nchauvinism. To be concerned with how Confucius might illuminate the\nthought of Aristotle is to do philosophy, but not Chinese\nphilosophy, and that is what they are about\nConfucianism looms large in their work. Some scholars are working\nwith Daoist and other texts unearthed from Mawangdui and elsewhere\n(Cao Feng), and a few are essaying Chinese themes against a Western\nmodel (Yang Guorong). But Confucianism is still seen as the embodiment\nand expression of Chinese culture, and is enjoying a renaissance of\ninterest and scholarship\u2014and general popularity\u2014not seen\nsince the May 4th Movement of 1919. A few Chinese\nphilosophers are asking what contribution Confucianism might make to\nphilosophy in a global context, but most of them are concentrating on\nits relevance to China today\u2014and tomorrow.\nA second difference between Chinese philosophers and Western\ncomparativists is that the Chinese do their work in accordance with\ntheir own \u201cgrammar\u201d, their own questions, definitions of\nproblems, methodology, patterns of argument and standards of\njustification. They, too, have inherited a tradition over two\nmillennia old, with a monumental amount of material\u2014there are\nover 8000 commentaries on the Analects alone\u2014but the\nquestions and problems are seldom those of the West, except in those\nsections of university philosophy departments that specialize in\nWestern philosophy. and there are not inconsequential differences in\nmethodology, patterns of arguments and styles of justification as\nwell.\nAmong the questions contemporary Chinese scholars are asking is the\nextent to which Confucianism might legitimately be considered a\nreligion. Are there resources in the texts to suggest making it a\nstate religion? (Kang Xiaoguang). Shouldn\u2019t the focus be on\nspiritual practice, not theory? (Pang Fei). What kind of constitution\nbest reflects Confucianism in today\u2019s world? (Jiang Qing). Is\nConfucianism better studied today against the background of Western\nphilosophy? (Zhang Longxi). Or must it be studied in its own cultural\ncontext? (Zhang Xianglong).\nThis is important work, which clearly has much of political as well\nas philosophical import, although the politics do not seem to be\ninspired by nationalism of any sort (although recapturing cultural\npride is clearly in evidence). Some of it will appear conservative to\nWestern eyes, as when the editor of an anthology on The\nRenaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China says that\n\u201cOne finds in these essays \u2026 only sparse attention to the\nWestern notion of human rights\u201d (Fan 2011: 2). Others envisage a\n\u201cprogressive\u201d Confucianism (Angle 2012: 1), which,\nunsurprisingly, includes more Western elements. The bulk of\ncontemporary philosophical scholarship in China is not, however, of\nmuch direct interest to Western philosophers (or the general public),\nwhich is why there is such a disparity between translations of work\ndone by the comparativists into Chinese (a lot) and Chinese\nscholarship rendered into English (very little). The Chinese can and\ndo study the work of their Western counterparts fairly closely,\nlargely for the insights that work provides on their own\ntradition. Coming the other way we have few works in English: the\npolitical text of Jiang Qing (2012) and some works on aesthetics by Li\nZehou (2006, 2009). There is little else, and what there is tends to\nbe articles in specialized anthologies (Fan 2011) or journals of\ntranslation (Contemporary Chinese Thought, The Journal of\nChinese Humanities).\nIn sum, textual exegesis and translation in Chinese philosophy is a\ncultural practice, but it is usually practiced differently in different\ncultures.  The situation is changing slowly, but probably will not\nchange very much for some time.\n4. Methodological Issues\n4.1 On Generalizations Cultural and Philosophical\n Deciding whether to be basically narrative or dialogical is\nprobably the first issue facing the exegete. Another issue\ninterpreters of Chinese texts must take into consideration in\nadvancing their positions is the extent to which one may make\ngeneralizations about Chinese civilization and culture writ large.\n This question arises because the conceptual categories within\nwhich Chinese authors thought and wrote differ sufficiently from the\ncontemporary English reader\u2019s that the former will be very\ndifficult to understand without being placed in a larger cultural and\nphilosophical overall conceptual framework, at least at first\nperusal. At the same time, however, if Western scholars are inclined\nto shudder when they hear sweeping generalizations about the history\nof Western culture and philosophy, knowing how diverse they really\nhave been and are, we should perhaps want to embrace the Golden Rule,\nand do unto other cultures what we would have done with our own.  And\nit can also be highly misleading, as a number of sinologists have been\narguing recently against their generalizing colleagues.\nThis is a perplexing problem. If we do not generalize to the larger\nmilieu in which a particular text is placed it is difficult to\nappreciate either what it says or the significance it has in the\nculture that grew it. But if the best we can do\u2014like a number of\nlate 19th century German scholars\u2014is characterize\nChina as a land of ewigen Stillstand we are surely better off\nwith no generalizations whatsoever; making vague or erroneous\ngeneralizations tend to stereotypes, and there are already a\nsuperfluity of these for China, from Charlie Chan to Fu Manchu.\n Thus the historian Michael Puett warns us that\nAll of these interpretive\n  strategies\u2014reading in terms of schools, essentialized\n  definitions of culture, evolutionary frameworks\u2014have the\n  consequence of erasing the unique power that particular claims had\n  at the time,\n  \n and recommends that \nwe dispense with \u2026 frameworks\u2026\n[and] \u2026 should instead work on a more nuanced approach\u2026.\n(Puett 2004: 23\u201325).\n \nBut on the other side is the Shang Dynasty historian David\nKeightley, who believes it important to essay major generalizations\nand who addresed the issue by asking \u201cWhat made China\nChinese?\u201d (Keightley 2014). The reader of that paper will see\nthat in addressing the grand question Keightley throws light on\nanother, closer to home: what makes us \u201cus?\u201d\nYet at the same time Puett was not simply crying\n\u201cwolf\u201d. A disturbingly large number of scholars have made\ngeneralizations that were not simply misleading in their consequences,\nbut have had racist, or \u201corientalist\u201d undertones, or, more\ncommonly, have just been plain flat-out wrong. To take only a few more\negregious examples, although not a trained sinologist, Kant studied\nChina and lectured on Chinese thought in his geography classes\nincluding statements that Confucius taught nothing but manners for the\nelite, and referred to the views of the Daodejing as\n\u201cthe monster system of Laotse\u201d; generalizing his remarks\nto \u201ca concept of virtue and morality never entered the heads of\nthe Chinese\u201d (Ching 1978: 168\u201369). These examples could be\nmultiplied many times over, and are not relics from the past:\n \nIt can be argued that almost every change China\n has ever undergone originated from abroad or because of some foreign\n stimulus. (Deeker 2013: 70)\nMoreover, there is an additional reason for eschewing\ngeneralizations (Goldin 2008: 21):\n \nIf there is one valid generalization about China,\nit is that China defies generalization.  Chinese civilization is\nsimply to huge, too diverse and too old for neat\nmaxims.\nUndercutting the image of a multimillenia, monolithic static\nculture is certainly a good thing, politically as well as\nintellectually.  Arguably more nonsense and worse has been written\nabout China than any other non-Western culture, and it is ongoing, as\nabove. But perhaps we should not eschew generalizations about China\naltogether. Shifting the angle of vision only very slightly Roger Ames\ngave an important rejoinder to the anti-generalizers (Ames 2011: 21):\n \nI would maintain that the only thing more\ndangerous than striving to make responsible cultural generalizations\nis failing to make them\u2026 .  Philosophical interpreters must\nsensitize the student of Chinese philosophy to the ambient uncommon\nassumptions that have made the Chinese philosophical narrative so\ndifferent from our own.\nPerhaps Keightley should have the last word on this issue. As\njustification for his asking \u201cWhat makes the Chinese\nChinese?\u201d He said:\nThe Chinese, after all, have probably fed more\npeople more successfully than any or other culture in world\nhistory. How they developed the social capital to do this is well\nworth our study. (2014: 83)\nGiven that it is nigh unto impossible to give an interpretation of\na text without making generalizations that go considerably beyond it,\nwe should give the nod to the pros rather than the cons in this\nparticular debate, but the latter perform the salutary function of\nwarning students to take the generalizations lightly at all times, and\nabandon them for others in the light of further study.\n4.2 Translating the Truth\n Davidson\u2019s focus on propositional truth\n(\u00a72.2 above) is altogether in\nkeeping with the concern of most Anglophone 20th century\nphilosophers to analyze language as the main means of communicating\nfacts about the world to our fellow human beings. When the facts are\nindeed as communicated, we say the statements expressing them are\n\u201ctrue\u201d. The precise nature of the relation between the\nfacts and the statements of them has generated different theories of\ntruth\u2014correspondence, coherence, pragmatic, semantic, even\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d\u2014with the question remaining an open\none today, although fewer philosophers are pursuing an answer to\nit.\n No matter which theory one adopts, elaborating this concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d involves a cluster of related\nconcepts: sentence, proposition, statement, fact, semantics,\nreference, connotation, denotation, plus a few others. There is\nanother conception of \u201ctruth\u201d, however, where the direct\nconveying of information is not central to the definition, and\nconsequently \u201cknowledge\u201d is also conceived somewhat\ndifferently. Other uses of language might be equally or more important\nfor some philosophers. Remember Chad Hansen\u2019s claim\n(\u00a72.2) that all of the\nearly Chinese philosophers held that \u201clanguage is a social\npractice. Its basic function is guiding discourse \u201d (1992:\n3). If so, then the standard translation of the graph zhi as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d becomes problematic, identified as it is with\n\u201cjustified true belief\u201d. Rosemont argues that \u201cWe\nare inclined to focus on the informative uses of language, that is,\nthe transmission of knowledge that\u201d. On his account\nreaders will profit more if zhi is translated as\n\u201crealize\u201d instead of \u201cknowledge\u201d, following\nHall and Ames (1987). \u201cIf \u2018to personalize\u2019 means\n\u2018to make personal\u2019, then \u2018to realize\u2019 is\n\u2018to make real\u2019 in the sense of knowing how, knowing\nabout, knowing to\u201d (Rosemont 2012: 47). Much the same thing\nhas been noted by Stephen Angle and Justin Tiwald in a forthcoming\nbook on Neo-Confucianism, in which they say they will focus on\n\u201cknowledge as an activity rather than knowledge as a set of\ntruths\u201d (2015: 5, 1).\nThis, too, may be construed as \u201ctruth\u201d, even though not\npropositional, and with a different concept-cluster around\nit: authenticity, engagement, trustworthy,\nintegrity, honesty, upright, and more. In\n2014 a Symposium celebrating the inauguration of a new online journal\nof cross-cultural philosophy (Confluence, 1, 1) was devoted\nto the question of whether the concept of truth was useful in the\npursuit of cross-cultural philosophical research. The four symposiasts\nrepresented Japanese philosophy, Confucianism, Aztec philosophy and\nTibetan Buddhism. None of them found close approximations for\n\u201ctruth\u201d in the propositional sense in the cultures they\nstudied, but all four said there were analogues for the terms\nassociated with truth as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d in the lexicons of\nthe thinkers and traditions they worked with. This non-propositional\nsense of truth is of course not unknown in the West; everyone\nunderstands what Vaclav Havel meant when he entitled an anthology of\nhis essays Living in Truth (1990). But it has not been a\nmajor concern among English-speaking philosophers since the analytic\nmovement got under way a little over a century ago.\nHelping people to hold true beliefs is a very worthwhile endeavor,\nand so is helping them transform themselves to lead meaningful\nlives. The translator/interpreter must be aware of which approach is\nreflected in the text under examination. If we believe the author(s)\nwere concerned with the way things are in the world, we will employ\ninterpretive methods to ascertain the truth of the claims made,\nnamely, those methods concerned with propositional truth: logical and\nlinguistic analysis, especially in the Anglophone tradition, and/or\nhermeneutics or phenomenology among continental philosophers.\n If we understand the ancient Chinese philosophers as having\nanother basic aim, however, we might pause at using Western\ninterpretive strategies adopted for propositional truth-seeking to\nstudy the praxis-guiding normative statements of the Chinese. In\npraxis-guiding discourse(s) human flourishing for oneself and others\nwas the basic concern. Put another way, the standard style of Western\nphilosophical writings tends to be explanatory and justificatory,\nwhereas the Chinese style tends to be narrative (of experience) and\nnormative. There are exceptions in both cases of course; normativity\nis no more unknown in the West than explanations are in China. But in\ngeneral truth is associated with facts and propositions in modern\nWestern philosophical texts, and with values and the conduct of\none\u2019s life in China\u2019s classical texts. If so, it is by no\nmeans clear that the methodologies developed for philosophical\ncritiques and exegeses in the modern Western tradition are suitable\nfor application mutatis mutandis to Chinese classical\nwritings; attempting to uncover and explicate one kind of truth may\nwell hinder acquiring insights about the other.\n4.3 Translating the Sounds of Silence\nThese two different senses of \u201ctruth\u201d bespeak two\ndifferent orientations toward philosophy and its purposes; we might\nloosely refer to them as truth- seeking and way-making. The\ntruth-seeking approach is familiar to us, being at the heart of the\nWestern intellectual tradition, in science no less than\nphilosophy. And philosophical analysis, hermeneutics and phenomenology\nare all tried and true methods for teasing the (propositional) truth\nfrom texts. The model for writing in this philosophical tradition is\nclarity and precision of expression (at least in the analytic\nschool).\nIt is not at all clear, however, that those methods are equally\nappropriate for working with Chinese texts much of the time. There are\ntwo reasons for this, the first of which is the Chinese model of\nwriting. Hark back to the discussion of classical Chinese earlier\n(\u00a71\u20131.4) while reading the following two quotes. First,\nfrom some NLP computer scientists:\n\nClassical Chinese poetry \u2026 is particularly concise, finely\nrich, highly rhetorical and thus linguistically complex, requiring a\nhigh degree of creativity in writing it, sophisticated interpretation\nin reading it, and difficulty in understanding it. (Fang, et\nal. 2009).\nThe comment is specifically about poetry but the point is fairly\ngeneral, especially for the canonical texts of the early period. For\nthe next quote, readers should keep in mind the Western philosophical\nmodel of writing, with clarity and precision the most valued narrative\nqualities. Michael Nylan again (2011: 66):\n Polysemy eminently suits the serious classical\nturn. For where words have more than one meaning, their appearance is\napt to induce an initial state of confusion. This confusion proves\nuseful if it makes readers aware that it is context and context alone\nthat determines the values and valences that words assume in any piece\nof writing, binding author to reader in the construction and\nreconstruction of meaning.\nIf analytic and hermeneutic methods do not get us to the\n\u201ctruths\u201d found in the classical texts, what other methods\nmight be employed? Leigh Jenco (2007) has argued that while the\nnon-Western orientation in comparative philosophy is clear from the\ntexts studied, the possibilities for using\nnon-western methodologies for philosophical inquiry into\nthose texts are not, and hence the adequacy of Eurocentric approaches\nto the discipline can be maintained, as well as the \u201cnot really\nphilosophy\u201d charge frequently levelled against Chinese texts\nbecause they do not contain arguments, are ambiguous, have little\nempirical or logical content, etc. Put another way, while Chinese\ntexts can become objects of study for the ideas contained in them,\ntheir methods of scholarly inquiry never enter the picture, continuing\nthereby to legitimate a Eurocentric approach to scholarly\nmethodologies.\nKalmanson (2017) picks up on Jenco\u2019s themes,\ndescribing Chinese methods for gaining insights from Chinese texts\nsuch as ritual preparation before reading them, meditation,\nmemorization and recitation. At first blush it might seem bizarre to\nsuggest that the performance of rituals, memorization and recitation\nshould be called \u201cmethods\u201d for interrogating philosophical\ntexts. But the bizarreness can lessen if we can get away from\npropositional truth, knowing-that, and expository models of clarity\nand precision.  The classical Chinese texts are composites more or\nless, are neither clear nor precise, are extremely terse, appeal to\nthe eye and the ear equally, and are replete with ambiguities. Yet the\nChinese have long held that those texts, composed and/or edited by the\nsages, contain all the truths needed to lead an exemplary life, a\nbelief firmly held by many for over 2000 years\u2014and still held by\nmore than a few today. Is it possible that we may gain more insight\ninto the \u201ctruths\u201d of the Daodejing by memorizing\nand then reciting it than by subjecting it to logical and linguistic\nanalysis?  The famous scholar-philosopher Zhu Xi of the\n13th century suggested how we should read, and his advice\nis perhaps an appropriate coda to this entry on issues in translating\nand interpreting Chinese philosophy:\n There is layer upon layer [of meaning] in the words of\nthe sages. In your reading of them, penetrate deeply. If you simply\nread what is on the surface you will misunderstand. Steep yourself in\nthe words; only then will you grasp their meaning.
