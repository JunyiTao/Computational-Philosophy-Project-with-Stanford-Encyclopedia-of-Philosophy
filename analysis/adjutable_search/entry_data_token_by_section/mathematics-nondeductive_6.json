    "main_text": "Non-deductive Aspects of the Deductive Method || G\u00f6del\u2019s results\n2.3 G\u00f6del\u2019s results\n\nUndoubtedly the most notorious of the limitations on the deductive\nmethod in mathematics are those which stem from G\u00f6del\u2019s\nincompleteness results. Although these results apply only to\nmathematical theories strong enough to embed arithmetic, the\ncentrality of the natural numbers (and their extensions into the\nrationals, reals, complexes, etc.) as a focus of mathematical activity\nmeans that the implications are widespread.\n\nNor should the precise implications of G\u00f6del\u2019s work be\noverstated. The order of the quantifiers is important. What G\u00f6del\nshowed is that, for any consistent, recursively axiomatized formal\nsystem, F, strong enough for arithmetic, there are truths expressible\nin purely arithmetical language which are not provable in F. He did\nnot show that there are arithmetical truths which are unprovable in\nany formal system. Nonetheless, G\u00f6del\u2019s results\ndid hammer some significant nails into the coffin of one version of\nthe deductive ideal of mathematics. There cannot be a single,\nrecursively axiomatizable formal system for all of mathematics which\nis (a) consistent, (b) purely deductive, and (c) complete. One line of\nresponse to this predicament is to explore options for non-deductive\nmethods of justification in mathematics.\n",
