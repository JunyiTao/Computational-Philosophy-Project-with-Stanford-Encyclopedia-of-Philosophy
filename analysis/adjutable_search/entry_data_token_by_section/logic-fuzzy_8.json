    "main_text": "Semantics justifying truth-functionality\n9. Semantics justifying truth-functionality\n\nIt is desirable, not only from a philosophical point of view, but also\nto a get a better grip on potential applications of fuzzy logics to\nrelate the meaning of intermediary truth-values and corresponding\nlogical connectives to basic models of reasoning with vague and\nimprecise notions. A number of such semantics that seek to justify\nparticular choices of truth-functional connectives have been\nintroduced. Just two of them are briefly described here.\n\nVoting semantics is based on the idea that different agents (voters)\nmay coherently judge the same proposition differently. The proportion\nof agents that accept a proposition \\(\\varphi\\) as true may be seen as\na truth-value. Without further restrictions this does not lead to a\ntruth-functional semantics, but rather to an assignment of\nprobabilities to propositions. But if one assigns a fixed level of\nskepticism to each agent and imposes some natural conditions that\nkeep the judgments on logically complex statements consistent with\nthose levels, then one can recover \\(\\min\\), \\(\\max\\), and \\(1-x\\) as\ntruth functions for conjunction, disjunction and negation,\nrespectively. Details can be found in Lawry 1998.\n\nAnother intriguing model of reasoning that provides a justification\nfor all propositional connectives of standard \u0141ukasiewicz logic\nhas been introduced by Robin Giles (1974). It consists in a game,\nwhere two players, I and you, systematically reduce logically complex\nassertions (formulas) to simpler ones according to rules like the\nfollowing:\n\nIf I assert \\(\\varphi \\lor \\psi\\), then I have to assert either\n\\(\\varphi\\) or \\(\\psi\\).\nIf I assert \\(\\varphi \\land \\psi\\), then you choose one of the\nconjuncts and I have to assert either \\(\\varphi\\) or \\(\\psi\\),\naccordingly.\nIf I assert \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\), then I have to assert \\(\\psi\\)\nif you assert \\(\\varphi\\).\n\n\nThe rules for quantified statements refer to a fixed domain, assuming\nthat there is a constant symbol for each domain element one\nstipulates:\n\nIf I assert \\(\\forall x\\, \\varphi(x)\\), then I have to assert\n\\(\\varphi(c)\\), for a constant \\(c\\) chosen by you.\nIf I assert \\(\\exists x\\, \\varphi(x)\\), then I have to assert\n\\(\\varphi(c)\\), for a constant \\(c\\) chosen by myself.\n\n\nThe rules for your assertions are dual. At each state of the game an\noccurrence of a non-atomic formula in either the multiset of current\nassertions by me or by you is chosen and gets replaced by subformulas,\nas indicated by these rules, until only atomic assertions remain. A\nfinal game state is then evaluated according to the following betting\nscheme.\n\nFor each atomic formula there is a corresponding experiment which may\neither fail or succeed, but may show dispersion, i.e., it may yield\ndifferent results when repeated. A fixed failure probability, called\nrisk value, is assigned to each experiment and thus to each atomic\nformula. The players have to pay \\(\\$\\)1 to the other player for each\nof their atomic assertion where the associated experiments fails. For\nany game starting with my assertion of \\(\\varphi\\) my expected overall\nloss of money, if we both play rationally, can be shown to correspond\nto the inverse of the truth-value of \\(\\varphi\\) evaluated in an\ninterpretation of \u0141ukasiewicz logic that assigns the inverse of\nthe risk values as truth-values to atomic formulas. In particular, a\nformula is valid in \u0141ukasiewicz logic if and only if, for every\nrisk value assignment, I have a strategy that guarantees that my\nexpected overall loss at the end of game is \\(0\\) or negative.\n\nChristian Ferm\u00fcller and George Metcalfe (2009) have pointed out a\ncorrespondence between optimal strategies in Giles\u2019s game and\ncut-free proofs in a hypersequent system for \u0141ukasiewicz logic.\nThe game has also been extended in Ferm\u00fcller & Roschger 2014\nto characterize various types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, intended to\nmodel natural language expressions like \u201cabout half\u201d or\n\u201calmost all\u201d.\n\nJeff Paris (2000) provided an overview over other semantics supporting\nvarious choices of truth functions; in particular, re-randomizing\nsemantics (Hisdal 1988), similarity semantics (e.g., Ruspini 1991),\nacceptability semantics (Paris 1997), and approximation semantics\n(Paris 2000). Let us also mention the resource-based semantics\nproposed in B\u011bhounek 2009. Moreover there are different forms of\nevaluation games for various fuzzy logics besides the one of Giles for\n\u0141ukasiewicz logic, outlined above. An overview over those\nsemantic games was given in Ferm\u00fcller 2015.\n",
