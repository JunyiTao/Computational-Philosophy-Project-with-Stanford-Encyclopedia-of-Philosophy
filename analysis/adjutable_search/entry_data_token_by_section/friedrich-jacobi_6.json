    "main_text": "Main Philosophical Works || The Open Letter to Fichte (1799)\n3.5 The Open Letter to Fichte (1799)\n\nWritten between March 3 and 21, 1799, the letter was published with\nFichte\u2019s consent, due to Jacobi\u2019s apparent intention to\nclear Fichte\u2019s name of the charge of atheism. Although in truth,\nJacobi merely suggests that the charge of atheism be dropped, only to\nreplace it with the accusation of nihilism (JWA 2, 2: 471\u2013473,\nand Ivaldo, 2003: 94\u201399). In Jacobi\u2019s eyes, nihilism is\nmarked by distinct features specific to modern thinking (although\nJacobi then traces the same features back to Aristotle, see Jacobi,\n1994(2): 541 and JWA 2, 1: 378\u2013379) that are detrimental to\nmeaning as such. The core message of Jacobi\u2019s letter is that a\nsystem of explanatory interconnections exhibits a perfectly harmonious\nground, which suppresses all individuality and makes existence\nimpossible (Jacobi, 1994(2): 508\u2013509 and JWA 2, 1:\n202\u2013203). This letter became quite well\u2013known due to its\nsimple and straightforward statement that Jacobi\u2019s own efforts\nlead inevitably \u2018to my \u2018non-philosophy\u2019, that has\nits essence in \u2018non-knowledge\u2019 just as your\n[Fichte\u2019s] \u2018philosophy\u2019 has it solely in\nknowledge\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 501 and JWA 2, 1: 194).\n\nThis makes Fichte the \u2018true Messiah of speculative reason, the\ngenuine son of the promise of a philosophy pure through and through,\nexisting in and through itself\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 501 and JWA 2,\n1: 194). For the first time, the reader of Jacobi\u2019s texts finds\nthis astonishing equation. Nihilism and philosophy go hand in hand,\nmaking Jacobi\u2019s non\u2013philosophy and non\u2013knowledge the\nonly remedy. The reason for Jacobi\u2019s use of qualifications such\nas \u2018pure\u2019 (rein) and \u2018through and\nthrough\u2019 (durchaus) with regard to Fichte\u2019s\nspeculative arguments for his doctrine of knowledge is that modern\nphilosophy is necessarily oblivious of the need to refer to what is\nbeyond reasoning when giving meaning to reasoning itself. To escape\ndelusion and anchor our thinking to existence, finding a theoretically\nacceptable connection to the \u2018realm of beings\u2019 is needed\n(Jacobi, 1994(2): 508 and JWA 2, 1: 202). If the original and\nimmediate duality of an I and a Thou is rejected, then one is destined\neither to derive everything from the I or to derive everything from\nbrute matter: \u2018Nobody can deny that the spirit of speculative\nphilosophy [\u2026] is to make unequal the equal certainty that\nthese two propositions have for the natural man: \u2018I am\u2019\nand \u2018There are things outside me\u2019. Speculative philosophy\nhad to try to subordinate one of these propositions to the other; to\nderive the former from the latter or the latter from the former\n\u2014 exhaustively, in the end \u2014 so that there would be but\none being and one truth before its eye, the all\u2013seeing\none!\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 501 and JWA 2, 1: 194).\n\nThe inevitable conclusion is that pure philosophy leads either to\nmaterialism, explaining everything from a self\u2013determining\nmatter, or to idealism, explaining everything from the\nself\u2013determining intelligence. At the center of all this lies\nthe notion of self\u2013determination, which allows Spinoza and\nFichte to mirror one another without differences being detected. As\nJacobi summarizes this, idealism is just \u2018inverted\u2019\nmaterialism, pure mathesis, where the unity of reality simply\ndisplays the operativity of a ground. Science thus forms an instance\nof the activity of this ground, and our comprehension of reality turns\nit into a sophisticated construction: \u2018[w]e comprehend a thing\nonly in so far as we can construct it, i.e., let it arise before us in\nthoughts, let it become. And in so far as we cannot construct it, or\nproduce it ourselves in thoughts, we do not comprehend it [\u2026].\nSo if a being is to become for us a fully comprehended object, we must\ncancel it in thought as something objective, as standing on its own;\nwe must annihilate it in order to let it become something thoroughly\nsubjective, our own creation, a mere schema\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2):\n508 and JWA 2, 1: 201\u2013202). Here, Jacobi identifies a\ndistinction between \u2018the true\u2019 (das Wahre) and\ntruth (die Wahrheit), between what is objective, given, i.e.,\na being in an I\u2013independent reality (the true), and\nwhat is constructed by the I according to the activity of its own\nstructure (the truth). Here again, Jacobi shows that he does\nnot wish to dismiss science altogether. Instead, he introduces a\ndifferent notion of truthfulness and a different understanding of the\nfunction that our rationality must fulfill. The nihilistic outcome of\nthe science of truth is overcome by the necessity that the true be\npresupposed for reasoning: \u2018I understand by \u2018the\ntrue\u2019 something which is prior to and outside knowledge; that\nwhich first gives a value to knowledge and to the faculty of\nknowledge, to reason [Vernunft]. \u2018Taking hold of\u2018\n[Vernehmen] presupposes something capable of being taken hold\nof; reason presupposes the true: it is the faculty of presupposing the\ntrue\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 513 and JWA 2, 1: 208).\n\nNow that the major features of Jacobi\u2019s realism have become\nclearer, one must also stress a passage that announces his future\nefforts and identifies the final destination of his\nnon\u2013philosophy: \u2018[a] reason that does not merely\nper\u2013ceive [the true] but produces all truth from itself alone; a\nreason which is the very essence of truth and has the fullness of life\nwithin itself \u2014 a self\u2013subsisting reason of this kind (the\nfullness of the good and true) must of course be present, for\notherwise nowhere would there be the good and the true; the root of\nnature and of all beings would be a pure nothingness, and the ultimate\naim of reason the discovery of this great mystery\u2019 (Jacobi,\n1994(2): 514 and JWA 2, 1: 209). This final step in Jacobi\u2019s\nendeavor foreshadows his philosophy of religion, which will be\ndeveloped in a text, \u2018On the Divine Things and their\nRevelation\u2019, that he will publish only in 1811. In that text, a\nmature account of Jacobi\u2019s realism is given, taking the form of\na sophisticated theism.\n",
