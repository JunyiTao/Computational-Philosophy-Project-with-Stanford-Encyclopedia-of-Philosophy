    "main_text": "Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates || Anti-realist accounts\n3.3 Anti-realist accounts\n\nWhile motivated by the previous concerns, anti-realists about\ndeterminables also aim to explain or explain away (or\n\u201cdebunk\u201d) at least some seeming motivations for\ndeterminables. A common debunking strategy appeals to something like\nBerkeley\u2019s (1710) claim that it is a mistake to suppose that\ngeneral terms denote abstract\n ideas.[21]\n For example, Heil (2003) echoes Berkeley\u2019s claim, taking\nseeming semantic reasons for positing determinables to reflect an\nuncritical tendency to suppose that \u201cwe can \u2018read\noff\u2019 features of reality from our ways of speaking about\nit\u201d (207), such that even if, e.g., the predicate \u2018is\nred\u2019 truly applies to some objects (tomatoes, apples, rubies) we\nshould not take this to be in virtue of their possessing the\n\u201cvery same property\u201d.\n\nAt least five positive anti-realist accounts of determinable terms or\nconcepts and their function are available. First is an account on\nwhich general terms/concepts indeterminately refer to determinate\nfeatures\u2014here, generality is placed in language or mind, rather\nthan world (see Berkeley\n 1710).[22]\n Second is a pragmatic account, on which the function of determinable\nterms reflects that we happen to have perceptual systems suited for\ntracking certain inexact similarities between objects having\n(ultimately highly complex) determinate properties (see Heil 2003).\nThat the \u2018work\u2019 determinable terms do consists in tracking\ninexact similarities between objects or determinates is also a theme\nin the remaining anti-realist accounts. Third is an account on which\ndeterminable terms are higher-order predicates of determinate\npredicates (see Searle\n 1959).[23]\n Fourth is an account on which determinable predicates are names of\nclasses of properties. Hence Mill maintains that determinable terms\nare\n\n\nnames not of one single and definite attribute, but of a class of\nattributes. Such is the word color, which is a name common to\nwhiteness, redness, etc. (1843/1973: I.ii.5)\n\n\nFifth is an account on which to have a determinable is just to have\none of the associated determinates. Hence Armstrong maintains that\n\n\nFor a particular to \u201cinstantiate\u201d a determinable is\n[\u2026] for it to instantiate just one of a class of\nuniversals\u2019 [\u2026] having the determinable property entails\nno more than having one of the determinate properties. (1997: 53; see\nalso Armstrong 1978)\n\n\nOne concern with anti-realist accounts has to do with the source of\nclassification of determinates under a determinable term or concept.\nAs above, this is usually taken to involve inexact resemblance, but if\ninexact resemblance is primitive, then objections of the sort leveled\nagainst resemblance nominalist treatments of inexact resemblance may\narise, mutatis mutandis\u2014notably, that differentially\nresembling pairs will themselves stand in second-order or higher\nprimitive resemblance relations, giving rise to regress (see Fales\n1990: 117\u201320 for discussion, and Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002: Ch. 6\nfor a response). An alternative means of classification of\ndeterminates appeals to \u201cnaturalness\u201d (as per Lewis 1983)\nas a primitive predicate or property binding determinates into\nclasses, but this approach, it might be complained, is not clearly\nexplanatory. Perhaps the most developed deflationary account of\ndeterminate classification is Armstrong\u2019s, on which \u201cthe\nresemblance of determinate universals is constituted by partial\nidentity, where the greater the resemblance the greater degree of\nidentity\u201d (1997: 51), such that, for example, determinate\nlengths resemble in virtue of sharing unit length\n universals.[24]\n Armstrong argues that his account makes sense of various features of\ndetermination: Determinate incompatibility is accommodated\nsince, e.g., an object\u2019s length cannot be identical to different\nsums of unit lengths; Determinate similarity/comparability is\naccommodated since different determinate lengths share some but not\nall unit lengths; Asymmetric modal dependence is accommodated\nsince specific sums of unit lengths entail the having of length, but\nnot vice versa. It has been complained, however, that such an\naccount cannot handle the full range of\n cases.[25]\n\nA second concern is that the presupposition that all properties are\nultimately maximally determinate violates certain possible and\npotentially actual conceptions of natural reality. For example, if\nobjects fill space, and space is both continuous and gunky (i.e., such\nthat every entity has proper parts), then the shapes and locations of\nobjects will be indefinitely subject to further determination (see\nSalmieri 2008: 78,\n n47).[26]\n And certain interpretations of quantum mechanics\n (see \u00a75.3\n for further discussion) and certain field-theoretic understandings of\nfundamental particles as having infinitely extensible boundaries\n(reflecting these particles\u2019 being constituted by long-range\ninteractions) suggest that natural reality is to some extent\nirreducibly determinable.\n\nA third and related concern is that it is unclear how the\neliminativist can accommodate (or debunk) all the motivations for\ndeterminables. It remains unclear, for example, how to explain Sorites\nphenomena if all properties\u2014including perceptual modes of\npresentation\u2014are maximally determinate.\n",
