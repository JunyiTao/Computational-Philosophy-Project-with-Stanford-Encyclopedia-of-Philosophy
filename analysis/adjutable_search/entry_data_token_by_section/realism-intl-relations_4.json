    "main_text": "Twentieth Century Classical Realism || E. H. Carr\u2019s Challenge to Utopian Idealism\n2.1 E. H. Carr\u2019s Challenge to Utopian Idealism\n\nIn his main work on international relations, The Twenty\nYears\u2019 Crisis, first published in July 1939, Edward Hallett\nCarr (1892\u20131982) attacks the idealist position, which he\ndescribes as \u201cutopianism.\u201d He characterizes this position\nas encompassing faith in reason, confidence in progress, a sense of\nmoral rectitude, and a belief in an underlying harmony of interests.\nAccording to the idealists, war is an aberration in the course of\nnormal life and the way to prevent it is to educate people for peace,\nand to build systems of collective security such as the League of\nNations or today\u2019s United Nations. Carr challenges idealism by\nquestioning its claim to moral universalism and its idea of the\nharmony of interests. He declares that \u201cmorality can only be\nrelative, not universal\u201d (19), and states that the doctrine of\nthe harmony of interests is invoked by privileged groups \u201cto\njustify and maintain their dominant position\u201d (75).\n\nCarr uses the concept of the relativity of thought, which he traces to\nMarx and other modern theorists, to show that standards by which\npolicies are judged are the products of circumstances and interests.\nHis central idea is that the interests of a given party always\ndetermine what this party regards as moral principles, and hence,\nthese principles are not universal. Carr observes that politicians,\nfor example, often use the language of justice to cloak the particular\ninterests of their own countries, or to create negative images of\nother people to justify acts of aggression. The existence of such\ninstances of morally discrediting a potential enemy or morally\njustifying one\u2019s own position shows, he argues, that moral ideas\nare derived from actual policies. Policies are not, as the idealists\nwould have it, based on some universal norms, independent of interests\nof the parties involved.\n\nIf specific ethical standards are de facto founded on interests,\nCarr\u2019s argument goes, there are also interests underlying what\nare regarded as absolute principles or universal moral values. While\nthe idealists tend to regard such values, such as peace or justice, as\nuniversal and claim that upholding them is in the interest of all,\nCarr argues against this view. According to him, there are neither\nuniversal values nor universal interests. He claims that those who\nrefer to universal interests are in fact acting in their own interests\n(71). They think that what is best for them is best for everyone, and\nidentify their own interests with the universal interest of the world\nat large.\n\nThe idealist concept of the harmony of interests is based on\nthe notion that human beings can rationally recognize that they have\nsome interests in common, and that cooperation is therefore possible.\nCarr contrasts this idea with the reality of conflict of\ninterests. According to him, the world is torn apart by the\nparticular interests of different individuals and groups. In such a\nconflictual environment, order is based on power, not on morality.\nFurther, morality itself is the product of power (61). Like Hobbes,\nCarr regards morality as constructed by the particular legal system\nthat is enforced by a coercive power. International ethical norms are\nimposed on other countries by dominant nations or groups of nations\nthat present themselves as the international community as a whole.\nThey are invented to perpetuate those nations\u2019 dominance.\n\nValues that idealists view as good for all, such as peace, social\njustice, prosperity, and international order, are regarded by Carr as\nmere status quo notions. The powers that are satisfied with\nthe status quo regard the arrangement in place as just and therefore\npreach peace. They try to rally everyone around their idea of what is\ngood. \u201cJust as the ruling class in a community prays for\ndomestic peace, which guarantees its own security and predominance,\n\u2026 so international peace becomes a special vested interest of\npredominant powers\u201d (76). On the other hand, the unsatisfied\npowers consider the same arrangement as unjust, and so prepare for\nwar. Hence, the way to obtain peace, if it cannot be simply enforced,\nis to satisfy the unsatisfied powers. \u201cThose who profit most by\n[international] order can in the longer run only hope to maintain it\nby making sufficient concessions to make it tolerable to those who\nprofit by it least\u201d (152). The logical conclusion to be drawn by\nthe reader of Carr\u2019s book is the policy of appeasement.\n\nCarr was a sophisticated thinker. He recognized himself that the logic\nof \u201cpure realism can offer nothing but a naked struggle for\npower which makes any kind of international society impossible\u201d\n(87). Although he demolishes what he calls \u201cthe current\nutopia\u201d of idealism, he at the same time attempts to build\n\u201ca new utopia,\u201d a realist world order (ibid.).\nThus, he acknowledges that human beings need certain fundamental\nprinciples or beliefs that are shared across different cultures, and\ncontradicts his own earlier argument by which he tries to deny\nuniversality to any norms or values. To make further objections to his\nposition, the fact, as he claims, that the language of universal\nvalues can be misused in politics for the benefit of one party or\nanother, and that such values can only be imperfectly implemented in\npolitical institutions, does not mean that such values do not exist.\nThere is a deep yearning in many human beings, both privileged and\nunprivileged, for peace, order, prosperity, and justice. The\nlegitimacy of idealism consists in the constant attempt to reflect\nupon and uphold these values. Idealists fail if in their attempt they\ndo not pay enough attention to the reality of power. On the other\nhand, in the world of \u201cpure realism,\u201d in which all values\nare made relative to interests, life turns into nothing more than a\npower game and is unbearable.\n\nThe Twenty Years\u2019 Crisis touches on a number of\nuniversal ideas, but it also reflects the spirit of its time. While we\ncan fault the interwar idealists for their inability to construct\ninternational institutions strong enough to prevent the outbreak of\nthe Second World War, this book indicates that interwar realists were\nlikewise unprepared to meet the challenge. Carr frequently refers to\nGermany under Nazi rule as if it were a country like any other. He\nsays that should Germany cease to be an unsatisfied power and\n\u201cbecome supreme in Europe,\u201d it would adopt a language of\ninternational solidarity similar to that of other Western powers (79).\nThe inability of Carr and other realists to recognize the perilous\nnature of Nazism, and their belief that Germany could be satisfied by\nterritorial concessions, helped to foster a political environment in\nwhich the latter was to grow in power, annex Czechoslovakia at will,\nand be militarily opposed in September 1939 by Poland alone.\n\nA theory of international relations is not just an intellectual\nenterprise; it has practical consequences. It influences our thinking\nand political practice. On the practical side, the realists of the\n1930s, to whom Carr gave intellectual support, were people opposed to\nthe system of collective security embodied in the League of Nations.\nWorking within the foreign policy establishments of the day, they\ncontributed to its weakness. Once they had weakened the League, they\npursued a policy of appeasement and accommodation with Germany as an\nalternative to collective security (Ashworth 46). After the annexation\nof Czechoslovakia, when the failure of the anti-League realist\nconservatives gathered around Neville Chamberlain and of this policy\nbecame clear, they tried to rebuild the very security system they had\nearlier demolished. Those who supported collective security were\nlabeled idealists.\n",
