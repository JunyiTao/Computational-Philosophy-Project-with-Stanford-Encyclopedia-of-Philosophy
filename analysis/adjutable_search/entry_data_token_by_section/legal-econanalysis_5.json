    "main_text": "Doctrinal Analysis || Doctrinal Analysis as a Concept of Law?\n2.2 Doctrinal Analysis as a Concept of Law?\n\nDoes doctrinal analysis implicitly or explicitly rely on some theory\nof law? It might be understood in a number of ways. It might be\nunderstood as the content claim (claim II) that holds that an\nefficiency criterion identifies the content of the law. The literature\ncontains arguments that virtually every (common law) legal rule is\nefficient. This claim has both an empirical interpretation that each\nlegal rule induces efficient behavior and a doctrinal interpretation\nthat the prevailing legal rule is identified by its efficiency. The\nliterature, however, has offered scant explanation or justification\nfor the underlying theoretical claim that efficiency\nidentifies the content of these legal norms. On what theory\nof law does efficiency become a ground of law?\n\nOne might justify the content in a variety of ways. A legal positivist\nmight argue that the rule of recognition identifies efficiency as an\nappropriate ground of judge-made law. Or one might argue, as Dworkin\nhas suggested, that efficiency provides the best interpretation of the\npractice governing the law of accidents. On either account, the claim\nthat efficiency identifies the content of the law is a contingent\nclaim. For the positivist, the content of the rule of recognition is\ncontingent on the social practice of the relevant public officials;\nthey may, but they need not, adopt an efficiency\n criterion.[15]\n Similarly, for Dworkin, the law derives from the best interpretation\nof the past political decisions of the community. These decisions are\nof course contingent; a different history of decisions might yield a\ndifferent account of law. Claim (II) thus does not constitute a\ncompeting concept of law.\n",
