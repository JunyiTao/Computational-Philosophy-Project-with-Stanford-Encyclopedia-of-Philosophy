Development of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logical Systems\n\n \nIt is important for understanding Le\u015bniewski\u2019s development and\nhis attitude to logical systems as endowed with meaning from the\nstart, and not meaningless formal games, to know that he developed in\nhis systems chronologically in the reverse order from their order of\nlogical priority. Logically, protothetic precedes ontology, and\nontology precedes mereology, but he worked them out starting from\nmereology and working through ontology to finish with\nprotothetic. Becoming frustrated with the inexactnesses and foibles of\nnatural language as a medium for working, in 1920 Le\u015bniewski let\nhimself be persuaded by Leon Chwistek that it would be advantageous to\novercome his distaste for symbolism and formulate his logical thoughts\nusing symbols. Mereology having been rather well formulated already in\n1916, the transition to symbolism was straightforward there. The fact\nthat axiomatization came first, and symbolization of the already\naxiomatized theory followed subsequently, gave Le\u015bniewski a\nstrong reason to dissociate the use of formal methods from\nformalism, according to which formulas are without\ninterpretation. Le\u015bniewski\u2019s formulas had an intended\ninterpretation from the start.\n",
