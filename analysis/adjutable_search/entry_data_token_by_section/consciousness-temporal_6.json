    "main_text": "Some Historical Episodes || Kant and Bergson\n2.3 Kant and Bergson\n\nIn the course of his elaboration of transcendental idealism in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1787) Kant made a number of claims\nthat would influence subsequent debates on temporal experience. These\nare not always easy to interpret\u2014for useful introductions see\nDunlop (2017) and Bardon (2019). For present purpose this passage in\n\u201cThe Synthesis of Reproduction in Imagination\u201d from the\nfirst Critique is particularly relevant:\n\n\nWhen I seek to draw a line in thought, or to think of the time from\none noon to another, or even to represent to myself some particular\nnumber, obviously the various manifold representations that are\ninvolved must be apprehended by me in thought one after the other. But\nif I were always to drop out of thought the preceding representations\n(the first parts of the line, the antecedent parts of the time period,\nor the units in the order represented), and did not reproduce them\nwhile advancing to those which follow, a complete representation would\nnever be obtained: none of the above-mentioned thoughts, not even the\npurest and most elementary representations of space and time, could\narise. \u2026. the reproductive synthesis of the imagination is to\nbe counted as among the transcendental acts of the mind. We shall\ntherefore entitle this faculty the transcendental faculty of\nimagination. (A102 [1980: 133])\n\n\nAnyone who holds that our sensory experience consists of nothing more\nthan a succession of momentary snapshots faces the problem of\nexplaining why we seem to be aware of duration and succession. Kant\nheld that our sensory experience does have this snapshot-like\ncharacter and solves the resulting problem by offering a richer\naccount of the momentary states. In the visual case, momentary\nepisodes of visual experiencing are accompanied by representations of\nrecently experienced visual contents. More generally, these\nrepresentations allow us to be aware that our presently occurring\nexperience is a part of an ongoing process.\n\nMore needs to be said, but Kant supplies at least the beginnings of\none plausible-looking account of how it might be possible for us to be\naware of change and succession in the way we seem to be, and it is an\napproach that can be developed independently of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism\u2014and its commitment to the unreality of\ntime. The \u201cretentional\u201d approach (recalling the\nterminology of\n \u00a71.1)\n soon found advocates, and is comparatively commonplace by the end of\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nIf we move onward a century we encounter Henri Bergson, a philosopher\nwho placed a highly dynamic form of temporal experience right at the\ncentre of his philosophy. As Canales (2015) vividly demonstrates, at\nthe beginning of the twentieth century Bergson\u2019s writings on\ntime and consciousness had considerable influence on his\ncontemporaries, both within the philosophical world and beyond. In his\nTime and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\nConsciousness (1889 [1910]) Bergson began his campaign against\nthe \u201cspatializing\u201d of time, and in this campaign the\nconcept of duration (or dur\u00e9e) plays a key\nrole. At least in his earlier writings, this concept applies to time\nas it is featured in our immediate experience. For Bergson,\ndur\u00e9e is a continuous dynamic experiential flow,\nimmeasurable and unquantifiable\u2014the \u201cceaselessly seething\nsurd at the heart of things\u201d, in Barrett\u2019s words (Gale\n1968: 373). As such it is radically unlike the static conception of\ntime as a manifold of mere locations to be found in the scientific\nconception of the world, whether Newtonian or Einsteinian.\n\n\nPure duration is the form which the succession of our conscious states\nassumes when our ego lets itself live,when it refrains from\nseparating its present state from its former states \u2026 We can\nthus conceive of succession without distinction, and think of it as a\nmutual penetration, an interconnexion and organization of elements,\neach one of which represents the whole, and cannot be distinguished or\nisolated from it except by abstract thought. (Bergson 1889 [1910:\n100\u2013101])\n\n\nMany of Bergson\u2019s characterizations of dur\u00e9e are\nnegative: he tells us a good deal about what it is not, but\ncomparatively little about what it actually is. While this can\nsometimes be frustrating, there is a rationale for it: Bergson held\nthat any attempt to conceptualize the flux of consciousness could\nsucceed only at the cost of distorting the phenomena\u2014a doctrine\nwhich influenced William James in his later years\u2014for more on\nthis see Dainton (2017a, 2022) and Dolev (2022).\n\nIn later works, such as Matter and Memory Bergson suggested\nthat primitive forms of dur\u00e9e can be found in all\nmaterial things, even the simplest particles and fields. If so,\ntemporal experience is ubiquitous, and there is a flowing dynamism at\nthe heart of literally everything. For more on Bergson\u2019s\nconception of the nature of matter see \u010capek (1971) and Sinclair\n(2019).\n\nBergson may have been influential during the first decades of the\ntwentieth century but not everyone was convinced of the fundamental\ncorrectness of his metaphysical and phenomenological claims\u2014even\nin the Francophone philosophical world of the period. In his\nIntuition of the Instant (1932) Gaston Bachelard launched a\nradical assault on Bergson\u2019s account of the temporality of\nconsciousness and the temporality of the world. For Bergson the static\ndurationless instant of mathematics and physics is an abstraction to\nwhich nothing in concrete reality corresponds\u2014reality is\nessentially extended and flowing. The position Bachelard defends is\ndiametrically opposed to Bergson\u2019s:\n\n\nTime alone has but one reality: the reality of the instant. Otherwise\nput, time is a reality confined to the instant and suspended between\ntwo voids. Although time will no doubt be reborn, it must first die.\nIt cannot transport its being from one instant to another in order to\nforge a duration. (Bachelard 1932 [2013: 6])\n\n\u2026 time is the instant, and it is the present instant that bears\nthe full weight of temporality. The past is as empty as the future.\nThe future is as dead as the past. The instant holds no duration at\nits core; it does not thrust a force in one direction or another. It\ndoes not have two faces. It is whole and alone. (1932 [2013: 28])\n\n\nBergson complained that conceiving of the continuity of experience in\nmathematical terms reduces experience to a \u201cdust of\ninstants\u201d. Bachelard responds thus:\n\n\nTime is noticed solely through instants; duration \u2026 is felt\nsolely through instants. Duration is a dust cloud of instants or,\nbetter yet, a group of points organized more or less coherently by a\nphenomenon of perspective. (1932 [2013: 19])\n\n\nWhile Bergson argued that the cinematic conception of the stream of\nconsciousness is fundamentally wrong, for Bachelard this conception is\nessentially correct\u2014and as we shall now see, he is not alone in\nthis.\n",
