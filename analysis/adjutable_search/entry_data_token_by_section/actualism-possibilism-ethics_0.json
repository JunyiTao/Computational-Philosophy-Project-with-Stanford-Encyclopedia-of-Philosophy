    "main_text": "Historical Origins of the Debate || Some Background Assumptions\n1.1 Some Background Assumptions\n\nFor contingent historical reasons, this debate has unfolded in such a\nway that the following background assumptions are made in the\nliterature. First, likely for ease of exposition, everyone writes as\nif counterfactual determinism is true (Goldman 1976: 469; Greenspan\n1978: 77). That is, it is assumed that there are facts about how an\nagent would (not simply might) act in any given\nsituation. This assumption, however, is not necessary for the purposes\nof the debate (Portmore 2011: 56 fn. 1). Second, since everyone writes\nas if both counterfactual determinism is true and as if agents can act\nin a way in which they do not in fact act, those in the debate seem to\nassume compatibilism. Interestingly, the concerns raised by the\nactualism/possibilism debate still arise even if libertarianism about\nfree will is assumed (Portmore 2011: 167 fn. 21). Describing the\ndebate in libertarian terms, however, does add an extra layer of\ncomplexity to the discussion. Third, some form of maximizing\nconsequentialism is generally assumed, again, likely for ease of\nexposition. The debate actually arises for any normative ethical\ntheory that holds that there are at least pro tanto reasons\nto bring about the good, and so the importance of this debate extends\nfar beyond forms of maximizing consequentialism (Bales 1972; Goldman\n1976: 458 fn. 13). Fourth, the various positions in the debate are\nunderstood in terms of objective, rather than\nsubjective, obligations, though the same issues arise with\nrespect to both. Objective obligations are those determined by all of\nthe normatively relevant facts, which include facts of which the agent\nmay be unaware. By contrast, subjective obligations are determined by\nthe agent\u2019s epistemic state (such as her beliefs, or beliefs\nthat would be supported by her evidence) concerning the normatively\nrelevant facts (cf. Zimmerman 1996: 10\u201320; Portmore 2011:\n12\u201323). Following the norms of the literature, these assumptions\noperate in the background of this encyclopedia entry as well. However,\nnone actually need to be made in order for the debate to get off the\nground.\n",
