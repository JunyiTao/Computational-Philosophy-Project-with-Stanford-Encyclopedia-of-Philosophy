    "main_text": "Montaigne and Relativism\n5. Montaigne and Relativism \n \n Renaissance thinkers strongly felt the necessity to revise their\ndiscourse on man. But no one accentuated this necessity more than\nMontaigne: what he was looking for, when reading historians or\ntravellers such as Lopez de Gomara\u2019s History of Indies, was\nthe utmost variety of beliefs and customs that would enrich his image\nof man. Neither the Hellenistic Sage, nor the Christian Saint, nor the\nRenaissance Scholar, are unquestioned models in the\nEssays. Instead, Montaigne is considering real men, who are\nthe product of customs. \u201cHere they live on human flesh; there it\nis an act of piety to kill one\u2019s father at a certain\n age (\u2026).\u201d[41]\n The importance of custom plays a polemical part: alongside with\nscepticism, the strength of imagination (chapter I,21) or Fortune\n(chapters I,1, I,24, etc.), it contributes to the devaluation\nof reason and will. It is bound to destroy our spontaneous confidence that\nwe do know the truth, and that we live according to justice. During\nthe XVIth century, the jurists of the \u201cFrench school of\nlaw\u201d showed that the law is tied up with historical\n determinations.[42]\n In chapter I,23, \u201cOn custom\u201d, Montaigne\n seems to extrapolate on this idea : our opinions and conducts being everywhere\nthe product of custom, references to universal \u201creason\u201d,\n\u201ctruth\u201d, or \u201cjustice\u201d are to be dismissed as\nillusions. Pierre Villey was the first to use the terms\n\u201crelativity\u201d and \u201crelativism\u201d, which proved to\nbe useful tools when commenting on the fact that Montaigne\nacknowledges that no universal reason presides over the birth of our\n beliefs.[43]\n The notion of absolute truth, applied to human matters, vitiates the\nunderstanding and wreaks havoc in society. Upon further reflexion,\ncontingent customs impact everything: \u201cin short, to my way of\nthinking, there is nothing that custom will not or cannot\n do\u201d.[44]\n Montaigne calls it \u201cCirce\u2019s\n drink\u201d.[45]\n Custom is a sort of witch, whose spell, among other effects, casts\nmoral illusion. \u201cThe laws of conscience, which we say are born\nfrom nature, are born of custom. Each man, holding in inward veneration \nthe opinions and the behavior approved and accepted around him, cannot \nbreak loose from them without remorse, or apply himself to them without\nself-satisfaction.\u201d[46] \n The power of custom, indeed, \nnot only guides man in his behavior, but also persuades him of\nits legitimacy. What is crime for one person will appear normal to\nanother. In the XVIIth century, Blaise Pascal will use\nthis argument when\nchallenging the pretension of philosophers of knowing truth.  One\ncentury later, David Hume will lay stress on the fact that the power\nof custom is all the stronger, specifically because we are not aware\nof it. What are we supposed to do, then, if our reason is so flexible\nthat it \u201cchanges with two degrees of elevation towards the\npole\u201d, as Pascal\nputs it?[47]\n For the Jansenist thinker, only one alternative exists, faith in Jesus\nChrist. However, it is more complicated in the case of\nMontaigne. Getting to know all sorts of customs, through his readings\nor travels, he makes an exemplary effort to open his mind. \u201cWe\nare all huddled and concentrated in ourselves, and our vision is\nreduced to the length of our\n nose.\u201d[48]\n Custom\u2019s grip is so strong that it is dubious as to whether we are in\na position to become aware of it and shake off its\npower. \n\n Montaigne was hailed by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss as the progenitor  of\nthe human sciences, and the pioneer of cultural\n relativism.[49]\nHowever, Montaigne has not been willing to indulge entirely in\nrelativism. Judgment is at first sight unable to stop the relativistic\ndiscourse, but it is not left without remedy when facing the power of\ncustom. Exercise of thought is the first counterweight we can make use\nof, for example when criticizing an existing law. Customs are not\nalmighty, since their authority can be reflected upon, evaluated or\nchallenged by individual judgment. The comparative method can also be\napplied to the freeing of judgment: although lacking a universal\nstandard, we can nevertheless stand back from particular customs, by\nthe mere fact of comparing them. Montaigne thus compares heating or\ncirculating means between people. In a more tragical way, he denounces\nthe fanaticism and the cruelty displayed by Christians against one\nanother, during the civil wars in France, through a comparison with\ncannibalism: \u201cI think there is more barbarity in eating a man\nalive than in eating him dead, and in tearing by tortures and the rack\na body still full of\n feeling (\u2026).\u201d[50]\n  The meaning of the word \u201cbarbarity\u201d is not merely\nrelative to a culture or a point of view, since there are\ndegrees of barbarity.  Passing a judgment on cannibals, Montaigne also\nsays: \u201cSo we may well call these people barbarians, in respect\nto the rules of reason, but not in respect to ourselves, who surpass\nthem in every kind of\n barbarity (\u2026).\u201d[51]\n Judgment is still endowed with the possibility of postulating\nuniversal standards, such as \u201creason\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d, which help when evaluating actions and\nbehaviors.  Although Montaigne maintains in the \u201cApologie\u201d\nthat true reason and true justice are only known by God, he asserts in\nother chapters that these standards are somehow accessible to man,\nsince they allow judgment to consider customs as particular and\ncontingent\n rules.[52]\n In order to criticize the changeable and the relative, we must\nsuppose that our judgment is still able to \u201cbring things back to\ntruth and\n reason\u201d.[53]\n Man is everywhere enslaved by custom, but this does not mean that we\nshould accept the numbing of our mind. Montaigne elaborates a\npedagogy, which rests on the practice of judgment itself. The task of\nthe pupil is not to repeat what the master said, but, on a given\nsubject of problem, to confront his judgment with the master\u2019s\none. Moreover, relativistic readings of the Essays are forced\nto ignore certain passages that carry a more rationalistic\ntone. \u201cThe violent detriment inflicted by custom\u201d (I,23)\nis certainly not a praise of custom, but an invitation to escape\nit. In the same way that Circe\u2019s potion has changed men into pigs,\ncustom turns their intelligence into stupidity. In the toughest cases,\nMontaigne\u2019s critical use of judgment aims at giving \u201ca good\nwhiplash to the ordinary stupidity of\n judgment.\u201d[54]\n In many other places, Montaigne boasts of himself being able to\nresist vulgar opinion. Independence of thinking, alongside with\nclear-mindedness and good faith, are the first virtues a young\ngentleman should acquire.  \n",
