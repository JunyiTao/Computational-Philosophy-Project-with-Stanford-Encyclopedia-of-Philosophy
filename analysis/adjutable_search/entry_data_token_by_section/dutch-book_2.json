    "main_text": "The Basic Dutch Book Argument for Probabilism || The Converse Dutch Book Theorem\n1.3 The Converse Dutch Book Theorem\n\nThere is reason to accept the conclusion of the DBA that one ought to\nsatisfy the probability axioms so as to avoid a Dutch Book only\ninsofar as satisfying the axioms affords at least the possibility of\navoiding exposure to a sure loss (H\u00e1jek 2005; 2008a,b). Here, the\nConverse Dutch Book theorem, proven independently by Lehman (1955) and\nKemeny (1955), plays an important role. Roughly stated the result is\nthat\n\nFor a set of betting quotients that obeys the probability axioms,\nthere is no set of bets (with those quotients) that guarantees a sure\nloss (win) to one side.\n\n\nIt assures that the agent would not be exploitable in any event, and\nthus establishes an advantage to obeying the axioms. Notice that the\ntheorem states that having betting quotients adhering to the axioms\nassures that one will not be susceptible to a sure loss, rather than\nmaking just the minimal claim required to establish an advantage to\ncoherence that such vulnerability may be avoided.\n\nBoth the Dutch Book theorem and its converse are sensitive to the\nformulation of the axioms, as well as to the understanding of\n\u2018bet\u2019, \u2018sure loss\u2019 and what it means for such\na loss to be guaranteed. Special care must be taken with the\ncharacterization of the probability axioms when it comes to the\nConverse Dutch Book theorem. Given that the axioms are formulated such\nthat the second axiom only requires that tautologies receive\nprobability one, it is possible to satisfy the axioms, yet still be\nopen to a sure loss. Consider the claim that if \\(b\\)\nhas \\(F\\) then something has \\(F\\). This\nis not tautological, but betting against it would leave one vulnerable\nto a sure loss. Sometimes the second axiom is instead formulated as\nrequiring that all logical truths receive probability one, but\nsatisfying this constraint leaves open the possibility of a sure loss\nby betting against a necessary truth such as \u2018nothing is both\nred and green all over\u2019. Even with strengthening the second\naxiom to require that all necessary truths receive probability one,\nthere is still a reading upon which the Converse Dutch Book theorem is\nfalse, since an agent will be vulnerable to a sure loss if she\nattaches a probability less than one to a known truth (or a\nprobability greater than zero to a known falsehood). One response to\nthis is to restrict \u2018sure loss\u2019 to those losses that do\nnot depend on contingent facts. Instead the restriction could be made\nto losses that are \u2018sure\u2019 in the sense that there is a\nmechanical formula for inflicting the loss, thus removing the sort of\ncounterexample to the Converse Dutch Book theorem with which we began,\nand the need to strengthen the axioms. A related move involves\nrestricting the allowable bets, rather than limiting what counts as a\nsure loss.\n\nIn observing that the Dutch Book theorem and the DBA are sensitive to\nthe formulation of the probability axioms, it should be noted that\nwhereas classical logic is generally presumed, probability axioms can\nbe formulated, with suitable adjustments, for non-classical logics.\nWeatherson argues that this is appropriate in representations of\nrational belief, and formulates axioms of probability that are built\nupon an intuitionistic logic, for which he then gives a Dutch Book\nargument (Weatherson 2003).\n\nIt is clear that in order for the Dutch Book theorem to hold,\n\u2018sure loss\u2019 must be taken to mean loss if the bets are in\nfact placed and settled. Violation of the probability axioms under any\nof their formulations does not guarantee an actual loss. Still more\nmust be said here about the meaning of \u2018sure loss\u2019, which\nsuggests some sort of necessity but does not tell us whether this is\nsupposed to be a particular form of logical necessity, metaphysical\nnecessity, or perhaps some other relative necessity. If \u2018sure\nloss\u2019 were taken as foreseeable loss, then an agent could\nviolate the axioms by attaching positive probability to a necessary\nfalsehood, where there is no foreseeable loss given the current state\nof knowledge concerning the proposition in question. There is also an\nissue concerning whether it is the agent who must be able to foresee\nthe loss. If \u2018sure\u2019 means decidable, then neither the\nformulation that logical nor that necessary truths receive probability\none will do, since there is no decision procedure for determining in\ngeneral whether a given sentence is a logical truth, let alone a\nnecessary one. Clearly, there is a delicate balance that must be\nstruck between the formulation of the probability axioms, and the\nunderstanding of \u2018bets\u2019 and \u2018sure loss\u2019 for\nthe Dutch Book theorem and its converse to hold.\n\nThere is a further issue with the Converse Dutch Book theorem, because\nthere are books that can be made against agents who violate other\nprobabilistic norms, such as Reflection, countable additivity and\nothers (see sections 3, 4, and 5). Satisfaction of the basic axioms is\nno guarantee that one will not be open to a book due to violation of\nsome other norm. A correct formulation of the theorem must accordingly\nrestrict the form and number of the allowable bets. Kemeny and Lehman\nput restrictions on the allowable bets (for example their betting\nsystems are restricted to a finite number of bets), and these seem to\nrule out such counterexamples. However, it remains to be shown that\navoiding book with such a restricted set of bets suffices to justify\nadherence to the axioms. The problem here becomes especially pressing\nwith the observation, discussed in the following section, that\nincoherent agents need not be generally vulnerable to a sure loss, and\nthus that both coherent and incoherent agents alike may be subject to\nsome books and not others. What is needed in arguing for adherence to\nthe probability axioms is the further claim that the bets which lead\nto sure losses and that are associated with incoherence pose a special\nproblem, although this threatens the use that many proponents of the\nDBA have wanted to make of Dutch Book arguments in defending other\nnorms.\n\nA related problem concerns the assumption made in the version of the\nDBA presented in section 1.2 that agents will accept, or at least find\nacceptable, those \u2018fair bets\u2019 on or against \\(P\\)\nwhere their degree of belief matches the betting\nquotient for the bet. As discussed in the next section, it is not true\nthat all such bets will be accepted, or even be regarded as\nacceptable, and additional bets may be accepted (or found acceptable).\nFor various reasons someone might accept bets in cases where her\ncredences do not correspond to the betting quotients of those bets,\nincluding where the bets constitute a Dutch Book. Thus, we need to be\nconcerned more generally with the array of bets that agents will\naccept (or find acceptable). But since this widens the class of bets\nthat can be used to produce a book, if anything it makes the problem\nfor the DBA that a coherent agent may be subject to a Dutch Book even\nworse. The version of the DBA in section 1.2 could be modified with\nthe claim that agents accept (or find acceptable) only bets that are\nfair or favorable, that is those with a non-negative expected value as\ncalculated using their degrees of belief. This rules out some\nadditional bets that would produce a Dutch Book for a coherent agent,\nbut not those that enter into the DBAs for other norms. However, this\nassumption does not hold generally, and fails to address other issues\nconfronting the argument.\n",
