    "main_text": "Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity || Proposals: Probability Representations\n4.2 Proposals: Probability Representations\n\nTo accommodate imprecise probabilities in decision-making, we need\nboth an alternative way to represent probabilities and an alternative\ndecision rule that operates on the newly-represented probabilities.\nThere are two primary ways to represent imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe first is to assign an interval, instead of a single\nnumber, to each proposition. For example, in the Ellsberg case: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np(\\RED) & = [\\lfrac{1}{3}], \\\\\np(\\YELLOW) & = [0, \\lfrac{2}{3}]; \\\\\np(\\BLACK) & = [0, \\lfrac{2}{3}].\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe second is to represent the individual\u2019s beliefs as a\nset of probability functions. For example, in the Ellsberg\ncase:\n\n\\[ \n\\cQ = \\{p\\in\\cP \\mid p(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\} \n\\]\n\n\nThis means,\nfor example, that the probability distribution \\(p(\\rR, \\rB, \\rY) =\n\\langle \\lfrac{1}{3}, 0, \\lfrac{2}{3}\\rangle\\) and the probability\ndistribution \\(\\langle \\lfrac{1}{3}, \\lfrac{1}{3},\n\\lfrac{1}{3}\\rangle\\) are both compatible with the available evidence\nor possible \u201ccompletion\u201d of the individual\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nEach set-probability representation gives rise to an interval representation (assuming the set of\nprobability functions is convex); but the set-probability\nrepresentation provides more structure to the relationships between\npropositions. (A different proposal retains a precise probability\nfunction but refines the objects over which utility and probability\nrange (Bradley 2015; Stef\u00e1nsson & Bradley 2015, 2019); see\ndiscussion in\n section 5.2.)\n",
