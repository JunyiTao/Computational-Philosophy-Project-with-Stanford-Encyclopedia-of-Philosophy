    "main_text": "Coincidence || Permanent Coincidence\n4.2 Permanent Coincidence\n\nThe cases discussed so far involve objects which seem to coincide for\na while, yet fail to coincide at other times at which at least one of\nthem exists. Perdurantists claim that temporarily-coincident objects\nare not wholly coincident: their non-coincident parts lie in the past\nor future. But other puzzle cases seem to involve\npermanently-coincident objects: even perdurantists have to accept that\npermanently-coinciding objects wholly coincide.\n\nSuppose that, instead of first forming or digging up the lump of clay\nthen later moulding it into a statue, you make the two halves of the\nstatue separately, then create both statue and large lump in one fell\nswoop, by sticking the halves together. Later, you petulantly smash\nthe thing into pieces, destroying statue and lump simultaneously.\nHere, it seems that the lump of clay and the statue coincide at every\nmoment at which either exists, yet they seem to be distinct objects\nbecause they differ in how they could have been: for example, the\nstatue could have been made of a different lump of clay, but the lump\ncould not. Talk of temporal parts doesn\u2019t help here: lump and\nstatue share all their temporal parts, and differ only in their modal\nfeatures (in how they could have been different).\n\nCan perdurantists accept that the lump and statue are distinct,\ncoinciding objects? In principle, yes, but this would be strategically\nunwise: accepting the possibility of complete coincidence without\nidentity leaves perdurantism with no advantage over the standard\nendurantist account of coincidence. Perdurantists are better advised\nto claim that the statue and the lump of clay are one and the same\nobject, then come up with some explanation of why they appear to have\ndifferent properties. We may say that the object in question could,\nqua statue, have been made out of a different lump of clay,\nbut could not, qua lump, have been made out of a different\nlump of clay. There are various ways of explaining what the\n\u2018qua\u2019 clauses are doing in this peculiar claim,\nand perhaps the most popular explanation involves counterpart theory,\na controversial theory about our talk of possibilities. Objections\nhere turn either on problems for counterpart theory, or else on\nwhether a satisfactory theory of how we talk about actual things can\never be compatible with this view.\n\nEndurantists are in a happier position regarding permanent\ncoincidence: whatever solution they have adopted in response to\ntemporary coincidence will also handle permanent coincidence (although\nadjustments are necessary in some cases).\n\nSuggested reading: This is a large field, but Rea\n(1995) provides a helpful overview, and the papers collected in Rea\n(ed.) (1997) are a useful next step. Sider (2001, chapter 5) and\nHawley (2001, chapters 5 and 6) also survey this area, both from a\ntemporal-parts perspective. Korman (2015: chapter 11) and Sattig\n(2015: chapters 3 and 5) provide more up-to-date entry points to the\ndebate. The standard account is advocated or discussed sympathetically\nby Doepke (1982), Baker (1997), Fine (2000; 2003), Johnston (1992),\nRobinson (1985), Levey (1997), Lowe (1983; 1997; 2003), Moyer (2006),\nOderberg (1996), Rea (1997), Simons (1985; 1986; 1987; 1997), Yablo\n(1987), Thomson (1983; 1998), Paul (2006) and Wasserman (2002);\ncritics include Olson (1997), Heller (2000), Hughes (1997a; 1997b),\nLewis (1971), Noonan (1993) and Burke (1992). Gilmore (2007) argues\nthat endurance theorists can handle coincidence by paying attention to\nthe appropriate notion of spatiotemporal location; Eagle (2010a)\ncriticises this argument, and Gilmore (2010) responds, followed by\nEagle (2010b). McGrath (2007a) argues that temporal parts views suffer\nthe same difficulties as the standard account; Hawley (2008) discusses\nthis further, whilst Hawley (2005) explores related issues; see also\nDonnelly (2016). Moyer (2009) argues that coincidence is neutral\nbetween endurance and perdurance; in response, Eddon (2010) defends\nperdurance; Rychter (2011) also defends perdurance here. Sattig (2008)\nargues that perdurantists cannot combine coincidence with informative\nidentity criteria. Temporary identity is advocated by Baxter (1989)\nand Gallois (1990; 1998). The claim that objects can be very easily\ndestroyed is advocated by Burke (1994a; 1994b; 1997a; 1997b) and Rea\n(2000), and critically discussed by Carter (1997), Denkel (1995), Lowe\n(1995b), Noonan (1999b), Olson (1997a), Zimmerman (1997) and Zammiello\n(2001). Restrictive ontologies are discussed by Chisholm (1973), Elder\n(1999), Merricks (2000; 2001), Olson (1996; 1997b), van Inwagen (1981;\n1990b), and Zimmerman (1997; 1995); Sidelle (1998) explores a number\nof interesting options, as does Needham (2010). Walters (2019) draws\nconnections with debates in mereology. It\u2019s hard to avoid\nWiggins (1980; 2001). The classic discussion of permanent coincidence\nis Gibbard (1975). Temporal-parts accounts of permanent coincidence\ninclude Noonan (1988; 1993; 1999a). Counterpart theory is advocated by\nLewis (1986, chapter 4). Magidor (2016) argues that the arguments\ndiscussed in this section cannot settle the endurance-perdurance\ndebate. A more formal approach to problems concerning change of parts\ncan be found in the separate entry on\n mereology,\n especially in section 3.2; further discussion can also be found in\nthe separate entries on\n material constitution,\n on\n relative identity\n and on\n ordinary objects.\n",
