    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Simple existence\n3.4 The Simple existence\n\nThe argument for the existence of God is related to a key doctrine\nthat explains the relationship of the One and the many through the\nnotion of the \u2018simple reality\u2019. This is central to Sadrian\nphilosophy, drawing upon the simplicity of the prior One in\nEnneads V.4[7].1.5\u201315,\n\nFor there must be something prior to all things which is simple, and\nthis must be different from all that comes after it, being by itself,\nnot mixed with those that come after it; yet being able to be present\nin the others in a different way, being truly one, and not something\nelse which is then one.\n\n\nIn his Treatise on the union of the intellecting subject and object,\nMulla Sadra draws on the Plotiniana and states that the\nActive Intellect is all things. This follows from his doctrine of the\nprimacy and logical priority of existence. In the Four\nJourneys, he quotes the following text from the tenth chapter of\nthe Theologia Aristotelis, an extract that exemplifies how\nthe doctrine of the simple reality reconciles monism and pluralism by\nadvocating neither.\n\nThe Pure One is the cause of all things and not of all things. Rather\nit is the beginning of everything and not all things. All things are\nin it and not in it. All things flow from it and subsist and are\nsustained by it and return to it. So if someone says: how is it\npossible that things are from a simple one that has no duality or\nmultiplicity in it in any sense? I say: because a pure simple one has\nnothing in it, but because it is a pure one, all things flow from it.\nThus when there was no existence (huwiyya), being flowed from\nit (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, VII: 351).\n\n\nIn his commentary, Mulla Sadra espouses a form of Neoplatonic\nprocession and doctrine of the intellect-psuch\u0113 that is at odds\nwith most of his philosophical discourse in the Four\nJourneys. First, he accepts the standard account of the\nTheologia. Nous as the first existent flows\nimmediately from the One and from it, existents proceed through the\nmediation of the intelligible realm. Second, the One is itself above\nperfection and plenitude. The first existent and the first perfect\nbeing is nous. This Neoplatonic background is significant\nbecause it seems to cause a problem for modulation. Can this simple\nreality be modulated and if that is the case does it not entail\nmultiplicity in the godhead? The second part of the objection is\nanswered in the quoted objection in the passage above. But for the\nfirst, following Enneads VI.2.20 it is clear that being is a\nquasi-genus in which the whole is prior to its parts but, because of\nits \u2018potency\u2019, remains unaffected by any procession. This\nrefers to the One, nous and all beings.\n\nThe doctrine of the simple reality is difficult but central to Sadrian\nphilosophy. The argument presented in the Wisdom of the\nThrone concerns the nature of God as that simple being and\nillustrates His knowledge of things through it (Morris 1981:\n98\u201399). The concept is central to resolving many theological\nproblems relating to the nature of God. Indeed, it is an important\nontological proof for the existence of God through an analysis of\nsimplicity.\n\nEvery simple reality is, by virtue of its unity, all things. It is not\ndeprived of any of these things except by way of imperfections,\nprivations and contingencies (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, VI: 185).\n\n\nGod is simple being because He is described by being, and being is a\nunique, simple reality. It is simplicity devoid of essence (Mulla\nSadra 2001\u20135, VI: 45\u201351). That simplicity is\nuncontaminated by multiplicity, privation, imperfection or any such\nnegative property. God\u2019s existence is pure and unencumbered by\ncomplexity such as an essence that might raise questions of genera,\ndivision, composition and definition.\n\nThis is God without multiplicity, at the level of singularity that\nencompasses the attributes considered intrinsically and not manifested\ntowards and manifesting the cosmos. The concept of a thing does not\nentail or include either its privation or its imperfection as there is\n\u2018no alterity in being since alterity is privation\u2019. Thus\nthe simple reality that is God does not include or entail\nimperfections or privations. An objection to this could be that\nnegative attributes are affirmed in theology, especially in the\nShi\u02bfi tradition in which one emphasises those concepts and\nproperties that cannot be predicated of Him such as \u2018He is not a\nbody\u2019, nor \u2018confined in a space\u2019 and so on. The\nanswer is that since these properties are negative, privative and\nimperfect, one can affirm them because \u2018the negation of negation\nis being and the negation of imperfection is perfection in\nbeing\u2019.\n\nMulla Sadra then proceeds to an analysis of language and\nsignification:\n\nThus [taking the example] you say C is not B. In\nthis context, if that with respect to which C is C\nis exactly the same as that with respect to which C is not\nB, so that C in itself would in its very essence be\nthe referent for the negation, then [if this were so] the essence of\nC would be privative fact since everyone who intellects\nC would also intellect not B. But the consequent is\ninvalid so the antecedent must be too. Thus it is established that\n[for every C] the subject of C-ness is a composite\nessence. Thus the mind distinguishes an existential meaning by which\nC is and a privative meaning by which C is not\nB or anything else negated of it.\n\n\nThe point being made concerns the existence-essence distinction.\nEverything that is not simple but complex is a composite pair of\nexistence and essence. But it also illustrates how the simple reality\nis an existence and encompasses things qua their existence\nand not their essence. Even more so, the simple existence has\nnothing to be negated because simplicity cannot be analysed into parts\nor components.\n\nIf anything can be negated of an existential factor, then it is not a\nsimple reality. Every simple reality is all things with respect to\ntheir existence and completeness and not with respect to their\nprivation and incompleteness.\n\n\nA simple reality cannot be predicated of anything since it is simple\nand unconditioned. This affirms diversity-in-unity since if nothing\ncan be predicated of God, then it follows that the cosmos cannot be\npredicated of Him. Thus, it denies existential monism.\n\nThe final part of the argument then relates this to the nature of\nGod\u2019s knowledge and His immediate presence to things such that\nthe \u2018claim of the unjust\u2019 that He does not know\nparticulars cannot arise. This is, of course, a reference to the\ndispute between Avicenna and al-Ghazali on God\u2019s knowledge of\nparticulars.\n\nIt is established that His knowledge of all things is a simple\nknowledge and their presence in Him is a simple reality. Knowledge is\nonly an expression for existence on the condition that it not be mixed\nwith matter.\n\n\nThus simplicity defines the nature of God\u2019s knowledge.\n\nThe doctrine of the simple reality has two further roles. First, it\nprovides a proof for the existence of God by perfection, as the most\nintense limit case, given that simplicity is an attribute of\nperfection. Second, it affirms his necessity in every sense thus\nnegating the famous doubt of Ibn Kamm\u016bna [d. 1284] of the\npostulation of two necessary existences. Simplicity denies any\ncontingent facet to God, who is necessary in every sense. God is\nsimple existence as He is uniquely necessary in and by Himself.\n",
