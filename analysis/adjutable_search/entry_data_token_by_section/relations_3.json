    "main_text": "Reductionism about Internal Relations\n4. The Nature of Relations: Order and Direction\n\nSupposing they exist, what is the nature of relations, whether\ninternal or external? It is the crucial feature of binary\nnon-symmetric relations, which distinguishes them from binary\nsymmetric relations, or, more generally, distinguishes relations which\nfail to be strictly symmetric from strictly symmetric ones, that they\nbestow order upon the things they relate. Non-symmetric relations do\nso, because they admit of differential application, i.e., for\nany such relation there are multiple ways in which it potentially\napplies to the things it relates. So, in particular, for every binary\nnon-symmetric \\(R\\), \\(a\\Rel b \\ne b\\Rel a\\). But can we say anything\nmore about how it is possible for non-symmetric relations to admit of\ndifferential application? More generally, can we say anything\ndiscursive about the origins of order?\n\nAccording to what is sometimes called the \u201cstandard\u201d\naccount of non-symmetric relations, we can (Russell 1903: \u00a794;\nGrossman 1983: 164; Paul 2012: 251\u20132). A non-symmetrical\nrelation \\(R\\) has a direction whereby it travels\nfrom one thing to another. What distinguishes\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) from \\(b\\Rel a\\) is that \\(R\\) runs from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) in\nthe former case and \\(b\\) to \\(a\\) in the latter. So differential\napplication is possible because non-symmetric relations have\ndirection, i.e., because non-symmetric relations run one way, rather\nthan another, amongst the things they relate. (See Johansson 2011 for\nan argument that \u2018direction\u2019 is really a cluster term\ncovering different logical and intentional notions.)\n\nThe standard account faces the serious objection that it is liable to\nover-generate relations, specifically converse ones, giving\nrise to an over-abundance of states that results from the\nholding of converse relations (Fine 2000: 2\u20135; cf. Russell 1913:\n85\u20137; Casta\u00f1eda 1975: 239\u201340; Armstrong 1978b: 42,\n94; for related puzzles arising out of the commitments of Armstrong\n1997, see Hochberg 1999: 157\u201360, Cross 2000 and Newman 2002).\nEmploying the notion of direction that the standard account\nuses to explain order, we can define the converse of a non-symmetric\n\\(R\\) as the relation \\(R^*\\) that runs from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\) whenever\n\\(R\\) runs from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). But once given this notion of a\n(distinct) converse, it is difficult to deny that \\(R\\) has a\nconverse. This is because it would be arbitrary to admit the existence\nof \\(R\\) whilst denying its converse (or vice versa). Hence,\nthe standard view is committed to the general principle,\n\n(Converses) Every non-symmetric relation has a distinct\nconverse.\n\nBut the admission of converse relations threatens to conflict with two\nplausible sounding principles about the number of states that arise\nfrom the holding of non-symmetric relations and their converses.\n\n(Identity) Any state that arises from the holding of a\nrelation \\(R\\) is identical to a state that arises from the holding of\nits converse \\(R^*\\).\n\n(Uniqueness) No one state arises from the holding of more\nthan one relation.\n\nSupport for Identity is garnered from intuitions: that the\ncat\u2019s being on top of the mat is the very same state as\nthe mat\u2019s being underneath the cat, that Obama\u2019s\nbeing taller than Putin is the very same state as\nPutin\u2019s being shorter than Obama, and so on.\nUniqueness is based upon more overtly theoretical grounds.\nStates are often conceived as complexes of things, properties and\nrelations. They are, so to speak, metaphysical molecules built up from\ntheir constituents, so states built up from different things or\nproperties or relations cannot be identical. Hence it cannot be the\ncase that the holding of two distinct relations give rise to the same\nstate.\n\nNow one problem with the standard view is that\nConverses, Identity and Uniqueness form an\ninconsistent triad, assuming there are non-symmetric relations. Take\nthe cat\u2019s being on top of the mat. Identity dictates\nthat this state is the very same state as the mat\u2019s being under\nthe cat. But if there is only one state in play here,\nUniqueness tells us that this state can only arise from the\nholding of one relation. So the relation that holds between the cat\nand the mat in virtue of which the cat is on top of the mat must be\nidentical to the relation that holds between the cat and the mat in\nvirtue of which the mat is underneath the cat. But this conflicts with\nConverses which tells us these relations are distinct.\n\nIn the face of this inconsistency a number of theoretical options are\nopen to us. If we wish to maintain the standard view that\nnon-symmetric relations have direction then something has to give. (1)\nEither we can give up Identity, Uniqueness, or both,\nor we can ditch Converses. Indeed it has been argued that\nConverses should be ditched anyway because it gives rise to a\nspecial kind of semantic indeterminacy: we cannot establish by our use\nof a sign for a binary non-symmetric relation \\(R\\) that we mean to\npick it out rather than its converse \\(R^*\\). This is because\nwe can shift the referent of a predicate from a given relation to its\nconverse whilst leaving undisturbed the truth conditions of the\nstatement in which the predicate occurs by making compensating\nadjustments to the manner in which the names flanking the predicate\nare interpreted (Williamson 1985: 252\u201355, 1987; van Inwagen\n2006: 458\u201368 but see Liebesman 2013 for a reply to Williamson).\nBut whether Converses is ditched to avoid semantic\nindeterminacy, or because Converses, Identity and\nUniqueness form an inconsistent triad, or for some other\nreason, the link between Converses and the standard view will\nhave to be broken. (2) Alternatively we can jettison\nConverses but throw out the standard view with it. But if\nthat\u2019s the option we choose, then we will have to go back to the\ndrawing board to provide a fresh account of differential application\nthat doesn\u2019t appeal to direction.\n\nThere is certainly room for development if we go down route (1). The\nintuitions that provide evidence for Identity are, like\nintuitions generally, considered by many philosophers to be relatively\nweak sources of evidence, because there may be all variety of\npsychological, historical and sociological forces responsible for our\nholding this or that view to be intuitive which have little to do with\nwhether the view is true or credible. There\u2019s also a tradition\nof conceiving states or facts as capable of being analysed into more\nthan one collection of constituents, i.e., a tradition that denies\nUniqueness (Frege 1884: \u00a764; Hodes 1982; see Macbride\n2007: 54\u201355 and Liebesman 2014 for counterarguments to\nFine\u2019s assumption; but see Leo 2013 for a view which denies\nuniqueness for states).\n\nAlternatively we may leave Identity and Uniqueness\nin place but question whether the standard view really does give rise\nto Converses. According to one line of thought (Russell 1913:\n86\u20137), it would be arbitrary for us to choose from the inside,\nso to speak, one binary non-symmetric relation at the expense of its\nconverse. But, it may be argued, this doesn\u2019t preclude nature\nchoosing for us from the outside, providing an externalist rather than\nan internalist foundation for admitting a non-symmetric relation but\nnot its converse. Nevertheless, even if Converses is ditched\nthere is another obstacle to the standard view, namely that it appears\nto give rise to questions about direction for which there are no\nsensible answers, even if doesn\u2019t over-generate converse\nrelations and states to house them (MacBride 2014: 5\u20137,\n9\u201310). Consider the states, (a) Antony is married to Fulvia and\n(b) Antony is to the left of Fulvia. If these states arise from their\nrespective relations travelling from one thing they relate to another,\nthen there must be a fact of the matter about which things proceed\nfrom and which to. So, we may ask, do they both proceed from the same\nthing or do they proceed from different things? It doesn\u2019t seem\nthat there could be a sensible answer to this question and so we\nshould avoid an account of differential application that commits us to\nthere being such recherch\u00e9 and undetectable facts of the\nmatter. (But note that whilst many philosophers have felt the pull of\nthese kind of intuitive considerations, others have argued that is is\nnecessary to introduce ordinal properties or relations to impose\nstructure upon relational facts. For example, Hochberg posits\n\u201cordering relations\u201d (Hochberg 1987, 1999: 180\u201381)\nwhilst Tegtmeier posits \u201cordinators\u201d, such as\n\u201ccoming first\u201d and \u201ccoming second\u201d in a fact\n(Tegtmeier 1990, 2004, 2016).)\n\nWhat are the options if we go down route (2)? Some philosophers have\nsuggested that if we ditch Converses then we will have to\ngive up non-symmetric relations altogether (van Inwagen 2006: 453).\nBut this presupposes that the only way to account for the distinctive\nfeature of non-symmetric relations, viz. differential\napplication, is to appeal to the standard view. However, philosophers\nthat go down this second route endeavour to account for differential\napplication by different means than direction and thereby\nearn the right to hold onto non-symmetric relations. We can\ndistinguish three broad strategies for explaining differential\napplication without direction, namely (1) positionalism, (2)\nanti-positionalism, and (3) primitivism, although\nthis does not exhaust the range of possibilities considered in the\nliterature (consider, for example, the view that relations are\nproperties of sequences discussed above (sec. 1).\n\nFirst, positionalism may be roughly sketched as the view that\nan \\(n\\)-ary relation has \\(n\\) argument positions, where argument\npositions are conceived as themselves entities, and, crucially, there\nis no intrinsic order to the argument places of a relation; neither\nargument position of a binary relation is the first or the second,\netc. (Casta\u00f1eda 1972, 1975; Williamson 1985: 257; Grossman\n1992: 57; Armstrong 1997: 90\u20131; Cross 2002: 219\u2013223, Fine\n2000: 10\u201316; Orilia 2011; Gilmore 2013). In the case of a binary\nnon-symmetric relation \\(R\\), this amounts to the idea that \\(R\\) is\nassociated with two further entities, % and #, its argument positions,\nand \\(R\\) holds between two given relata \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) relative to\nan assignment of objects to % and #. The difference between \\(a\\Rel\nb\\) and \\(b\\Rel a\\) (differential application) is then explained in\nterms of the different relative assignments of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to %\nand #: \\(a\\) to % and \\(b\\) to # in one case, and \\(b\\) to % and \\(a\\)\nto # in the other. But since the argument positions do not themselves\nexhibit any significant order or direction, there is no basis here for\nintroducing converses, i.e., relations that differ only with respect\nto their direction of travel.\n\nDifferent versions of positionalism vary with regard to\n\\((i)\\) the nature of argument positions, crucially upon whether they\ncan be shared by different relations, and \\((ii)\\) the variety of\nargument positions, whether there are different kinds of position\nspecifically suited to different kinds of relata, and \\((iii)\\) the\ncomplexity of the relation whereby things are assigned to positions.\nAccording to Orilia\u2019s onto-thematic role view,\npositions are capable of recurring in different relations and suited\nby their nature to different sorts of filling (Orilia 2011, 2014,\nPaolini Paoletti 2016, 2018b sec. 2, and for an earlier version\ninspired by Leibniz, Orilia 2008). For example, the loves\nrelation has agent and patient roles, roles which also recur in the\nhates relation. Other more complex relations involve more and\ndifferent roles, for example, theme, location, instrument, goal\netc. Orilia\u2019s idea is that the schedule of ontological\nroles belonging to relations should be informed by the linguistic\nprogramme of identifying thematic roles in natural language because\nthis helps us to provide informative generalisations about what\ndifferent relations have in common (see Davis 2011 for a helpful\nintroduction to the thematic role literature in linguistics).\n\nBy contrast, other versions of positionalism conceive of\npositions as unique to the relations in which they figure. Some\npositionalists of this stripe conceives of each position as being\nassigned a unique occupant (Gilmore 2013). But others whilst sharing\nthe assumption that positions are unique to the relations in which\nthey figure, also maintain that it is a mistake to assume that there\nis a 1-1 correspondence between positions and their occupants. So this\nversion of positonalism conceives relations more liberally as having\npositions capable of being assigned several distinct occupants at once\n(see, for example, Armstrong 1997: 91, Yi 1999: 169; Fine 2000: 17,\nMacBride 2005: 588). Further sophistication is added by the idea that\npositions can be occupied by a number of things varying between fixed\nlimits (Hazen&Taylor 1992: 376, 390, Dixon 2018: 207) and by the\nsuggestion that the assignment of things to positions should also be\nrelative to a number to allow for one and the same thing to\nsimultaneously occur more than once in the same position (Dixon 2018:\n213\u20136).\n\nA different line is taken by Donnelly\u2019s relative\npositionalism, according to which positions are a kind of\n\u201crelative property\u201d (Donnelly 2016). Donnelly takes\nbeing north as an example of a relative property: a property\nbecause it is had by one thing but only relative to something else, in\nthis case a location. Her basic idea is that corresponding to each\nn-ary relation R is a package of relative properties\n(as many as n factorial properties) such that when n\nthings instantiate R they instantiate these properties relative to one\nanother (Donnelly 2016: 91). It is a distinctive feature of the view\nthat by positing for each relation a bespoke package of relative\nproperties which models the logical character of the relation in\nquestion, relative positonalism is able to handle relations\nof arbitrary complexity, including symmetric and partially symmetric\nrelations (Donnelly 2016: 88\u201396, Dixon 2019: 56\u201367). By\ncontrast, the onto-thematic role approach doesn\u2019t\nprovide a once and for all recipe for positing roles but takes this to\nbe a matter to be settled by systematic \u201contological\ninvestigation\u201d into the character of relations as we find them\n(Orilia 2014: 296\u2013301 but see objections from MacBride 2014:\n11\u201312, Ostertag 2019: 1492\u20135).\n\nThere are two immediate challenges faced by the different versions of\npositionalism. Can the account be generalized to cover all\nrelations? If, for example, the binary symmetric relation that holds\nbetween two things \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) whenever \\(a\\) is next to \\(b\\) has\ntwo argument positions, \u00a3 and $, then there should be two\npossible ways of assigning \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to \u00a3 and $. But this\nmeans (absurdly) that there are two different ways for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nto be next to one another, i.e., symmetric relations admit of\ndifferential application too! Orilia\u2019s onto-thematic\nrole approach handles this kind of case by conceiving of thematic\nroles as \u201cintra-repeatable\u201d (Orilia 2014: 294), so there\nis only one role or position in play in this relation (\u00a3 = $)\nand so the possibility of different assignments to different roles or\npositions doesn\u2019t arise. Similarly, Dixon\u2019s\n\u201cpocket\u201d theory handles this case by conceiving the\nnext to relation as having only one pocket. But, as Fine\n(2000: 17\u201318, 2007: 58\u20139) and MacBride (2007: 36\u201344)\nargue, and as Dixon (2018: 31, n.21) acknowledges, this kind of\nstrategy doesn\u2019t straightforwardly extend to more complex\npartially symmetric relations such as being arranged clockwise in\na circle in that very order, or, playing-tug-of-war.\nAccordingly Orilia (2011: 6\u20139, 2014: 296\u2013301) proposes a\nprogramme of analysis whereby more complex relations are reduced to\nsimpler ones that the onto-thematic role approach can accommodate. By\ncontrast, relative positionalism can handle these kinds of\npartially symmetric relations without any analysis (Donnelly 2016:\n88\u201396, Dixon 2019: 56\u201367), but not multigrade relations\nwhich lack a fixed arity n, hence cannot be modelled by a\nn! package of relative properties (Donnelly 2016: 94, Dixon\n2019: 59) (For further criticisms of positionalism see\nHochberg 1999: 153, 2000: 40\u20131).\n\nThe more general challenge that faces the different versions of\npositionalism is whether we have a better understanding of positions\nand the assignment relation that the different versions of\npositionalism propose, than we do of the relations that positions and\nassignment are used to explain (Fine 2000: 16; MacBride 2014:\n11\u201312; Orilia 2014: 302\u20133). Consider, for example,\nDonnelly\u2019s claim that the application of n-ary\nrelations needs to be explained in terms of packages of n!\nrelative properties. One problem, acknowledged by Donnelly (2016: 98),\nis the ontological cost of having to trade in each relation for so\nmany properties. Another problem concerns why relative properties of a\ngiven package cannot be instantiated independently of one another but\nonly relative to other properties belonging to that package, even\nthough each relative property is meant to be unary. The obvious\nexplanation is that such properties aren\u2019t unary at all but to\nbe explained in terms of an underlying relation (Bigelow &\nPargetter 1990: 55, MacBride: 2000: 83). So saying that one thing\nx has a property relative to something else y having\nanother relative property etc is more perspicuously rendered\nby saying that x bears a relation to y.\n\nBoth the standard view and the different versions of\npositionalism assume that the differential application of a\nnon-symmetric relation \\(R\\) with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is to be\nexplained \u201clocally\u201d in terms of \\(R\\), whether its\ndirection or argument positions, and the things it relates, \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\). Anti-positionalism is the doctrine, due to Kit Fine,\nwhich eschews direction and argument positions and explains\ndifferential application by abandoning the assumption that\ndifferential application is to be explained locally (Fine 2000:\n20\u201332). According to anti-positionalism, the difference between\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) and \\(b\\Rel a\\) arises from how these states are\ninter-connected with other states that arise from \\(R\\) holding of\nother relata. So order is not a feature of given state capable of\nbeing isolated, but only emerges over a totality of states to which\n\\(R\\) gives rise. What distinguishes \\(a\\Rel b\\) from \\(b\\Rel a\\) is\nthat inter-connectedness with other states such as \\(c\\Rel d\\). Pay\nspecial attention to the relative arrangement of the schematic names\nin the following sentence. Whereas the state \\(a\\Rel b\\) is a\ncompletion of \\(R\\) by \\(a, b\\) in the same manner as \\(c\\Rel d\\) is a\ncompletion of \\(R\\) by \\(c, d\\), the state \\(b\\Rel a\\) isn\u2019t.\nThe state \\(b\\Rel a\\) is a completion of \\(R\\) by \\(b\\), \\(a\\) in the\nsame manner as \\(c\\Rel d\\) is a completion of \\(R\\) by \\(c, d\\) (Fine\n2000: 21). However, Fine doesn\u2019t take the notion of two states\nbeing put together \u201cin the same manner\u201d as primitive, but\nexplains this in terms of a substitution relation. To say that a state\n\\(s\\) is a completion of relation \\(R\\) by \\(a_1, a_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) in\nthe same manner as a state \\(t\\) is completion of \\(R\\) by \\(b_1, b_2\n\\ldots, b_n\\) is to say that \\(s\\) is completion of \\(R\\) by \\(a_1,\na_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) that results from simultaneously substituting \\(a_1,\na_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) for \\(b_1\\), b\\(_2 \\ldots, b_n\\) in \\(t\\) (and\nvice versa) (Fine 2000: 25\u20136). Fine goes on to suggest\nthat the notion of simultaneous substitution of many objects may be\ndefined, under certain conditions, in terms of the single substitution\nof one object (Fine 2000: 26 n. 15). Converses is avoided\nbecause the notion of direction, in terms of which the distinction\nbetween converse relations is drawn, is eschewed. This is because\nsubstitution is doing all the work.\n\nFine\u2019s version of anti-positionalism has certain\nlimitations, including the assumption that states arising from a\nsingle relation have a unique composition and that substitution\noperates on objects rather than occurrences of objects. Leo (2013)\nprovides a more fully developed version of anti-positonalism\nthat addresses these limitations from a more formal point of view.\nAccording to Leo, relational complexes are structured perspectives on\nstates \u2018out there\u2019 in reality, relational complexes have\noccurrences of objects, and different complexes of the same relation\nmay correspond to the same state. It is key to this approach that\nsubstitution is a primitive operation taking a complex and an\nassignment of objects to the occurrences of objects in the complex as\ninput and returning another complex as output. For example, for the\ncomplex of Anthony\u2019s loving Cleopatra, substituting Abelard for\nthe occurrence of Anthony and Eloise for the occurrence of Cleopatra\nresults in the complex of Abelard\u2019s loving Eloise. Substitution\nis identified in terms of basic principles governing substitutions, in\nparticular a composition principle, which forms the heart of an\nantipositional theory of relations (Leo 2013: 363; for further\ndevelopments and defence of this version of\nanti-positionalism, see Leo 2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2014,\n2016).\n\nBy abandoning the assumption that differential application is to be\nexplained locally, anti-positionalism in effect tells us that\nwe\u2019re misconceiving the logical form of our ordinary relational\njudgements. Contrary to their surface form, relational judgements\nalways have a suppressed argument position for other states, by which\nmeans the state we are making a judgement about is implicitly compared\nto another. The following two objections arise (MacBride 2007:\n47\u201353). First of all, anti-positionalism presupposes a\nnon-symmetric relation of substitution to explain differential\napplication. But this suggests that the explanation anti-positonalism\nprovides involves a circularity because it uses a non-symmetric\nrelation, substitution, whose differential application is take for\ngranted. Take the state \\(a\\Rel b\\). The result of substituting \\(a\\)\nfor \\(b\\) is the state \\(a\\Rel a\\); where the result of substituting\n\\(b\\) for \\(a\\) is the state \\(b\\Rel b\\). The outcomes are different\nso the substitution relation must be order sensitive. Secondly,\nanti-positionalism entails that there cannot be lonely binary\nrelations, i.e., relations which only hold of exactly two things. But\nprima facie we should be able to distinguish \\(a\\Rel b\\) from\n\\(b\\Rel a\\) even if \\(R\\) holds between nothing except \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\), Antony\u2019s loving Cleopatra from Cleopatra\u2019s loving\nAntony even if the world is otherwise loveless (see, for replies to\nthese objections, Fine 2007: 59\u201362, Wieland 2010: 487\u201393,\nLeo 2014: 279\u201381).\n\nThe third strategy, primitivism, seeks to avoid the\ndifficulties that threaten positionalism and\nanti-positionalism by taking the radical step of asking us to\nreconfigure our explanatory settings. It\u2019s a familiar thought\nthat we cannot account for the fact that one thing bears a relation\n\\(R\\) to another by appealing to a further relation \\(R'\\) relating\n\\(R\\) to them\u2014that way Bradley\u2019s regress beckons. To avoid\nthe regress we must recognise that a relation is not related to the\nthings it relates, however language may mislead us to think otherwise.\nWe simply have to accept as primitive, in the sense that it cannot be\nfurther explained, the fact that one thing bears a relation to\nanother. But, according to primitivism, it is not only the fact\nthat one thing bears a (non-symmetric) relation \\(R\\) to\nanother that needs to be recognised as ultimate and irreducible.\nHow \\(R\\) applies, whether the \\(a\\Rel b\\) way or the \\(b\\Rel\na\\) way, needs to be taken as primitive too (MacBride 2014:\n14\u201315). The difficulties encountered by attempts to provide an\nanalysis of differential application provide corroborative evidence\nfor primitivism. Does refraining from providing an analysis of\ndifferential application constitute shirking an obligatory task for\nsystematic philosophy? Hardly. Remember what Lewis correctly said\nabout predication: \u201cNot every account is an\nanalysis\u201d (Lewis 1983: 352). What we need, according to\nthis third strategy, is a form of realism committed to the existence\nof relations but which denies that the manner of their application,\ntheir differential application, can be further explained.\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the debate about relations and\ndifferential application is that there is no single sense in which the\ndifferent views we have considered seek to \u201cexplain\u201d or\n\u201caccount\u201d for differential application. They all run on\ndifferent explanatory settings. Some think there is a genuine problem\nto do with the capacity of relations to differentially apply which\nneeds to be explained by any successful theory of relations. Hence,\nbecause he thinks there is a genuine problem here, Hochberg claims\nthat the question which any adequate theory of relations must answer\n\u201cis about how the order is ontologically grounded in\nfacts\u201d (Hochberg 2001: 178). But others think that there\nisn\u2019t a problem of differential application at all, much less\none that requires an ontological analysis of relations or facts. This\nmeans that the debate cannot be reduced to simply an exchange of\nopinions about which view explains the most at the least cost.\n\nFor example, positionalists typically maintain that their positing\nroles, slots, pockets and relative properties enables them to answer\nwhat they take to be obligatory questions about why each relation\napplies the way it can and why some relations are capable of applying\ndifferently from the ways others can (Dixon 2019: 68). So the\ndifferent ways that the relations between and\nadjacency are capable of applying is explained by\npositionalists in terms of the different ontological structures\nattributed to these relations, i.e. their number of roles or\npositions and the nature of the relation that assigns things to roles\nor positions. By contrast, anti-positionalists and primitivists deny\nthat such questions about why relations have the capacity to\ndifferentially apply need answering at all. As Fine describes his own\nversion of anti-positionalism, \u201cIt is a fundamental\nfact for [the anti-positionalist] that relations are capable of giving\nrise to a diversity of completions in application to any given relata\nand there is no explanation of this diversity in terms of a difference\nin the way the completions are formed from the relation and its\nrelata\u201d (Fine 2000: 19).\n\nHowever, the explanatory differences between the parties to the debate\nrun deeper than merely whether they think the capacity of relations to\ndifferentially apply is open to informative explanation. Whilst Fine\ntakes the capacity of relations to differentially apply as primitive,\nFine also holds that it is necessary to provide an account of wherein\nthe difference consists between two states which arise from the same\nconstituents: \u201cYet clearly the state of Anthony\u2019s loving\nCleopatra and the state of Cleopatra\u2019s loving Anthony are\ndistinguishable; they are not merely two indiscernible\n\u201datoms\u201c within the space of states. But if these states\nare not to be distinguished by how they derive from the given relation\nand its relata, then how are they to be distinguished?\u201d(Fine\n2000: 20). Fine\u2019s answer, as we have seen, is spelled out in\nterms of substitution. But Leo\u2019s version of anti-positionalism\nhas different explanatory settings again. He doesn\u2019t engage with\nmetaphysical questions about wherein the difference between states\nconsists and instead provides principles of substitution intended to\nexplicate rather than explain the differential application of\nrelations (Leo 2013: 361\u20138). And primitivism, we have seen,\ntakes the fact that relations admit of differential application as\nunanalysable too but also takes the difference between states arising\nfrom the same constituents as primitive (MacBride 2014: 8,\ncf. van Fraassen 1982). The dispute about relations and\ndifferential application continues because it remains to be\nestablished which questions about relations are genuine and which are\npseudo-problems.\n\nIn conclusion, it should be emphasised that nothing written here is\nintended to imply that there is just one problem of order\n(differential application). It\u2019s plausible that there are\nseveral problems in the vicinity, whether logical, metaphysical or\nepistemological and they will require different if co-ordinated\nsolutions.\n",
