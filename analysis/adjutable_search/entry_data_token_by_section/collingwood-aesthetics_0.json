    "main_text": "Art as Craft, Magic, Representation and Amusement\n1. Art as Craft, Magic, Representation and Amusement\n\nThere are four concepts of human activity which are commonly called\n\u2018art\u2019, but which according to Collingwood, should be\nsharply distinguished from what he calls \u2018art proper\u2019. The\nimplication is that those things are improperly so-called, that is,\nare commonly but wrongly called art. Since today the tendency in\naesthetics is to insist that all things called \u2018art\u2019 are\nrightly so-called, it is important emphasize this fact; the\nInstitutional Theory of Art, and the Theory of Mass Art, would no\ndoubt be viewed by Collingwood as pernicious linguistic confusions.\nBut in fact it is worse than this. Art proper is often found within\nthe context of those other things; even particular works of art\n(proper) may at the same time be instances of those things.\nFurthermore, it is not as if \u2018art\u2019 once had the true\nmeaning appertaining to art proper, and then got extended to these\nother things; the word has always been more or less subject to at\nleast some of these confusions. The task, then, is to distinguish the\nconcept from those of many other competing related human activities,\nand to claim that it alone deserves to be called art.\n",
