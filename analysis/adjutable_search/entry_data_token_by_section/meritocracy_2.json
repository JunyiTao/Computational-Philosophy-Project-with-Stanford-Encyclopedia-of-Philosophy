As we shall\nsee\n (\u00a74.1),\n some meritocrats explicitly invoke desert in their theories of\njustice. And desert is implicit in much other work on meritocracy.\n(Seminal research on desert includes Feinberg 1963, Kleinig 1971, and\nSher 1987.)\n\nThere is no consensus about the precise link between merit and desert.\nThomas Mulligan (2018b) argues that merit is an important basis for\ndesert and thereby has moral force. Jeppe von Platz (2022) uses\n\u201cdesert\u201d to describe an agent\u2019s character and\n\u201cmerit\u201d to characterize the real-world effects (e.g.,\nachievements) of that character. John Lucas (1980) uses the terms in\njust the opposite way. Owen McLeod says that merit is \u201cquite a\nspecific kind of desert\u201d (1999: 67). Pojman disagrees:\n\u201cMerit is a broader concept, the genus of which desert is the\nspecies\u201d (1999: 86). No attempt has yet been made to evaluate\nthese disparate views, let alone reconcile them. Observe, too, that\nmerit and desert are sometimes used synonymously\u2014we might say\nthat Sam \u201cdeserves the prize\u201d or, apparently equivalently,\nSam \u201cmerits the prize\u201d.\n\nTwo of desert\u2019s conceptual features are especially relevant to\nmeritocracy. First, desert is a pre-institutional notion.\nWhat a person deserves is not, and cannot be, determined by the rules\n(organizations, practices, etc.) governing distribution. Rather,\ndesert should determine those rules.\n\nImagine a race in which all blonde runners get a 10 second head start.\nThe race is run, and a blonde beats a brunette by a nose.\nInstitutionally\u2014within the rules of this race\u2014the blonde\nshould get the medal. But she does not deserve it. The\nbrunette deserves the medal; she was fastest. For the desertist, the\nbrunette ought, morally, to receive it. The blonde is merely\n\u201centitled\u201d to the medal. Further, for the desertist, this\nis a bad race; its rules ought to be changed so that institutional\nentitlements line up with deserts.\n\nIn contrast, a libertarian view of justice denies that there is a\ndeeper, fiducial standard against which the institution can be judged\n (\u00a75.4).\n So long as all the runners freely chose to participate in this race\n(and weren\u2019t misled about the rules, etc.) the blonde ought,\nmorally, to receive the medal. The fact that rules do not ensure that\nthe fastest runner receive the medal is, for the libertarian,\nirrelevant to justice. (For discussion of desert-based versus\nentitlement-based arguments, see Olsaretti 2003a.)\n\nSecond, desert is often thought to contain principles of\naboutness and fitness. The aboutness principle holds\nthat the basis for desert must be \u201cabout\u201d (somehow\nconstrued) the subject of a desert-claim for that claim to be bona\nfide. One cannot, for example, deserve prison on the basis of\nsomeone else\u2019s crimes. One common construal of aboutness is\nresponsibility\u2014if a person is not responsible for a\ncrime, he cannot deserve prison for it.\n\nArguments abound about the influence of luck on people\u2019s\ncharacter and achievements. Luck plausibly severs aboutness and\nthereby people\u2019s claims to deserve on the basis of their merit.\nIf Jones is the most meritorious applicant because of his hard work,\nhe has a strong case to deserve the job. If Jones is meritorious\nbecause he had the good luck of being raised in a rich family, things\nare murkier.\n\nThe fitness principle holds that there is a natural connection between\nthe basis for desert and the object being awarded. If a person commits\na crime, he deserves prison\u2014not a medal. Prison fits crime; a\nmedal is unfitting.\n\nAs will be discussed in\n \u00a74,\n meritocrats debate what the appropriate understanding of\n\u201cmerit\u201d is when it comes to distributing political\noffices, jobs, income, and other goods. Does a just, meritocratic wage\nreflect a person\u2019s skill? His effort? The\ncontribution he makes? Or is \u201cmerit\u201d conceptually\nprimitive, unable to be defined in any of these terms?\n",
