    "main_text": "Multilocation\n6. Multilocation\n\nTo say that an object is multilocated is to say that it has more than\none exact location: \u2018x is multilocated\u2019 means\n\u2018\u2203y1\u2203y2[L(x,\ny1) & L(x, y2)\n& y1\u2260y2]\u2019. We\nconsider a series of putative examples of multi-location in\n Section 6.3.\n\nThe debate over multilocation concerns\n\nFunctionality+\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y1\u2200y2[[L(x,\ny1) & L(x, y2)]\n\u2192 y1=y2]\n\nNecessarily, nothing has more than one exact location.\n\n\nOpponents of multilocation accept Functionality+. Friends of\nmultilocation typically want to affirm something stronger than the\nnegation of Functionality+. They typically accept the possibility of\nan entity that is exactly located at each of two regions that do not\neven overlap.\n\nEarlier we glossed \u2018x is exactly located at\ny\u2019 as \u2018x has (or has-at-y) the same\nsize and shape as y, and stands (or stands-at-y) in all\nthe same spatiotemporal relations to things as does y\u2019.\nThus spheres are exactly located only at spherical regions, cubes only\nat cubical regions, and so on. When an entity is said to be\nmultilocated, then, it is said to stand in this relation to each\nof several regions: informally put, it has the same size, shape,\nand position as region r1; it has the same size,\nshape, and position as region r2; and so on. No\nclaim is made to the effect that the object is exactly located at the\nfusion of r1, r2,\n\u2026, or at any proper parts of any of these regions.\n\nTo clarify the idea of multilocation in an informal way, it may be\nuseful to consider Figure 6, inspired by Hudson (2005: 105) and\nKleinschmidt (2011: 256).\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\nA scattered, singly located\n\nobject\n\n\n\n\nA non-scattered, multilocated\n\nobject\n\n\n\nThe object o1 is scattered: its shape is that of the\nsum of two non-overlapping circles. It is not multilocated. Rather, it\nhas just one exact location: the scattered region\nr3. It is not exactly located at any proper part of\nthat region, such as r1 or r2.\n\nThe object o2 is multilocated. It has two (and only\ntwo) exact locations. It is exactly located at the circular region\nr3; and it is exactly located at the circular region\nr4, which does not overlap r3. It\nis not exactly located at their fusion, and it is not located at any\nof their proper parts. Since o2 is exactly located\nat r3, which is circular, o2 is\ncircular, at least at r3. For parallel\nreasons, o2 is circular at r4. By\ncontrast, o1 is not circular simpliciter,\nnor is it circular at any region.\n\nEverything we have said so far is neutral with respect to whether\neither of the material objects is simple. It may be that both objects\nare simple, or that both are complex, or that o1 is\nsimple and o2 is complex, or vice versa. This\nis worth emphasizing, since questions about the possibility of\nextended simples and questions about the possibility of multilocation\nare sometimes run together.\n\nIt is natural to think that if these two objects were visible, they\nwould be visually indistinguishable. Indeed, it is tempting to think\nthat there would be no empirical difference between\no1 and o2. For those with\nverificationist leanings, this may lead to the belief that there is no\ndifference at all between o1 and\no2 and hence that there must be something defective\nabout the initial set-up of the case.\n",
