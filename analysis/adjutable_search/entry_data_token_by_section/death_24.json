But how could posthumous events affect\npeople if not via backwards causation?\n\nSome theorists say that posthumous harm occurs when posthumous events\nchange the value of a person\u2019s life for the worse. Dorothy\nGrover (1989) suggests that posthumous events may affect the\n\u201cquality\u201d of a person's life, say by changing the value of\nher accomplishments. David Velleman (1991) argues along similar lines,\nclaiming that later events may affect the meaning of earlier events,\nand the latter bears on the value of a person\u2019s life.\n\nSome theorists (for example, Pitcher 1984, Feinberg 1984, Luper 2004\nand 2012, and Scarre 2013) appeal to preferentialism to explain the\npossibility of posthumous harm. We noted earlier that preferentialists\ncan defend the idea that some events harm their victims retroactively,\nand that death is such an event. Preferentialists can take a similar\nstance on posthumous events, assuming that things that happen after we\ndie may determine whether desires we have while alive are fulfilled or\nthwarted.\n\nAccording to Pitcher, posthumous events harm us by being responsible\nfor truths that thwart our desires. For example, being slandered while\nI am dead makes it true that my reputation is to be damaged, and this\nharms me at all and only those times when I desire that my reputation\nbe untarnished. It is while I am alive that I care about my\nreputation\u2019s always being intact, and it is while I am alive\nthat my well-being is brought lower by posthumous slander. Similarly,\nmy desire that my child have a happy upbringing even if I am not there\nto provide it will be thwarted if, after I die, she catches some\ndevastating illness. The event that makes it true that my child will\nbe miserable occurs after I am gone, but this truth thwarts my desire\nabout my child now, so it is now that I am worse off. The posthumous\nevents themselves harm me only indirectly; directly I am harmed by\ntheir making things true that bear on my interests.\n\nHowever, the desire-based case for the possibility of posthumous harm\nremains controversial. It will be rejected by theorists who doubt that\npeople are harmed by events that do not modify their intrinsic\nfeatures, and by theorists who think that it hinges on the possibility\nof backwards causation, of course. Velleman (1991, p. 339) rejects the\ndesire-based case on the grounds that \u201cwe think of a person's\ncurrent well-being as a fact intrinsic to the present, not as a\nrelation that he currently bears to his future.\u201d Some theorists\necho a criticism that was offered by Partridge (1981, p. 246).\nConsider an event that thwarts one of a person's desires. To harm her\nby virtue of thwarting that desire, Partridge claims, the event must\noccur while she still has that desire, while she still cares\nabout whether it is fulfilled, but she and her desire are gone by the\ntime a posthumous event occurs. For some theorists (Vorobej, 1998,\nSuits 2001), the point is that we have no reason to care whether our\ndesires are fulfilled by events that occur once we no longer have\nthose desires, and we no longer have desires after we die. Parfit\nresisted this charge by noting that while some of our desires are\nconditional on their own persistence (we want them fulfilled at a time\nonly on condition that we will still have them at that time), others\nare not.\n",
