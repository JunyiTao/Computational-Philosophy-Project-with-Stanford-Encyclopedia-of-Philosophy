    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art\n5. Philosophy of Art\n\nHumboldt is hardly known as a philosopher or historian of art and\naesthetics. Yet, the second volume of Kosmosoffers a lengthy\nexploration of the relationship between the history of art and the\nhistory of science. As Humboldt explains in volume three of\nKosmos, while the first volume examines \u201cthe pure\nobjectiveness of external phenomena\u201d, in the second his aim is\nto consider nature \u201cas the reflection of the image impressed by\nthe senses upon the inner human being, that is, upon his ideas and\nfeelings\u201d (Kosmos 3: 386; CO 3: 1; translation\naltered). The goal, in other words, is to see nature through\nhuman ideas and feelings about nature, which are most clearly\nand eloquently expressed in art.\n\nThough some scholars have expressed confusion about Humboldt\u2019s\nsudden shift to art and feeling in this second volume (Dettelbach\n1997), in light of Humboldt\u2019s use of the arts (e.g., landscape\npainting), it is clear that, for Humboldt, art does not only carry\naesthetic value but also cognitive value. Indeed, Humboldt took issue\nwith philosophers who\u2014like Edmund Burke and Kant\u2014argued\nthat aesthetic experience and intellectual interest occupy two\ndifferent (and unrelated) spheres in the human mind (Kosmos\n1: 18; CO 1: 40). As he saw it, aesthetic presentation has the\npotential to transform the very way we know nature. By furnishing a\nhistorical exposition of the relation between artistic expression and\nempirical investigation, and showing how the arts aided in the\nexpansion of knowledge, Humboldt\u2019s goal is to furnish a\nhistorical justification of this view.\n",
