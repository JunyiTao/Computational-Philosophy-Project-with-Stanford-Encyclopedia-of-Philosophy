    "main_text": "The Naturalist Turn\n3. The Naturalist Turn\n\nAlvin Goldman (2006) has distinguished a descriptive from a normative\nepistemological problem of other minds.\n Section 1\n and\n section 2\n were largely concerned with the latter; this section will concern\nitself with the former. The descriptive problem is associated with\nwhat Goldman terms mind reading (or mentalizing).\nMind reading involves the capacity to think about mind and is a second\nor higher order activity that involves representing or conceptualizing\nothers (as well as oneself) as \u201cloci of mental\nlife\u201d (Goldman 2006: 3). While many species of animal may be\nthought to have minds, only some will be capable of representing\nanother as having minds. Questions of justification and conceptual\ndifficulty are not of concern to the descriptive theorist, nor are\nmetaphysical questions concerning the nature of mind; what concerns\nthe descriptive epistemologist is how what she says measures up with\nwhat is being learned in the empirical disciplines of developmental\npsychology and neuroscience. Work on the descriptive problem is\ndeveloping at a rapid pace and, while at first attention in all the\nrelevant disciplines was concentrated on two prominent accounts of\nmind reading\u2014theory-theory and simulation theory\u2014a variety\nof accounts now exist which challenge both of these accounts (see\n \u00a73.2).\n",
