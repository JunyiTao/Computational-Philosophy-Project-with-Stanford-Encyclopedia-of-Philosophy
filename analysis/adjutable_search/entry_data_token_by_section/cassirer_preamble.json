    "main_text": "\n\nErnst Cassirer occupies a unique place in twentieth-century\nphilosophy. His work pays equal attention to foundational and\nepistemological issues in the philosophy of mathematics and natural\nscience and to aesthetics, the philosophy of history, and other issues\nin the \u201ccultural sciences\u201d broadly conceived. More than\nany other German philosopher since Kant, Cassirer thus aims to devote\nequal philosophical attention both to the (mathematical and) natural\nsciences (Naturwissenschaften) and to the more humanistic\ndisciplines (Geisteswissenschaften). In this way, Cassirer,\nmore than any other twentieth-century philosopher, plays a fundamental\nmediating role between C. P. Snow\u2019s famous \u201ctwo\ncultures.\u201d He also plays a similarly mediating role between the\ntwo major traditions in twentieth-century academic philosophy \u2013\nthe \u201canalytic\u201d and \u201ccontinental\u201d traditions\n\u2013 whose radically different (and often mutually uncomprehending)\nperspectives on the relationship between scientific and humanistic\nelements in their subject gave rise to a fundamental split or gulf\nbetween philosophy as it came to be practiced in the Anglo-American\nworld, on the one side, and as it was practiced in most of the rest of\nthe world, on the other. Cassirer, by contrast, had fruitful\nphilosophical relations with leading members of both traditions\n\u2013 with Moritz Schlick, the founder and guiding spirit of the\nVienna Circle of logical empiricists, whose work in logic and the\nphilosophy of science had a decisive influence on the development of\nphilosophy in the United States, and with Martin Heidegger, the\ncreator of a radical \u201cexistential-hermeneutical\u201d version\nof Husserlian phenomenology which quickly became dominant in\ncontinental Europe.\n",
