    "main_text": "Introduction || About the Abstract/Concrete Distinction\n1.2 About the Abstract/Concrete Distinction\n\nThough we\u2019ve spoken as if the abstract/concrete distinction must\nbe an exhaustive dichotomy, we should be open to the possibility that\nthe best sharpening of it will entail that some objects are neither\nabstract nor concrete. Holes and shadows, if they exist, do not\nclearly belong in either category; nor do ghosts, Cartesian minds,\nfictional\n characters,[2]\n immanent universals, or tropes. The main constraint on an account of\nthe distinction is that it draws a philosophically significant line\nthat classifies at least many of the standard examples in the standard\nways. It is not a constraint that everything be shoehorned into one\ncategory or the other.\n\nFinally, some philosophers see the main distinction not as between\nabstract and concrete objects but as between abstract objects and\nordinary objects, where the distinction is a modal one\n\u2013 ordinary objects are possibly concrete while abstract objects\n(like the number 1) couldn\u2019t be concrete (Zalta 1983,\n1988). In any case, in the following discussion, we shall assume that\nthe abstract/concrete distinction is a division among existing\nobjects, and that any plausible explanation of the distinction should\naim to characterize a distinction among such objects.\n",
