The Mohists helped to critically refine early\nChinese conceptions of the content and function of logic and language\nin relation to their aspirations for developing a comprehensive\nethical theory about the proper governance of the state and of the\nindividual\u2019s role within it. Arguably, much of the\nMohists\u2019 motivation for developing this theory should be\ncredited to those whom the Mohists themselves identified as their\nphilosophical adversaries or antagonists, and this point extends to\nthe determination they exhibited in developing an explicit\nphilosophical theory of logical reasoning. Among those adversaries\nwere the followers of\n Confucius,\n whose appeals to authority and established traditions for the\njustification of ethical views the Mohists found objectionable, and\nthe advocates of\n Daoism,\n whose views appeared to undermine the possibility of any invariable\nand objective standards for ethical conduct. But quite possibly a more\ncompelling influence, at least in regards to the development of Mohist\nlogic, sprang from the medley of thinkers and dialecticians who have\ntraditionally been associated with the School of Names. While no\nexplicit theory of logical reasoning is attributed to this school, the\nthinkers associated with it had a reputation for unexampled deftness\nin the practice of dialectics and argumentation, and are regarded by\nmany scholars today as among early China\u2019s most subtle\npractitioners of logic (Fung 2020a). On the other hand, these thinkers\nwere also derided by their contemporaries, including by the Mohists,\nfor their sophistry, for their dispositions to muddle and confuse, and\nfor their apparent desire to obscure the proper use of language.\nWhether masters of logical reasoning or merely performers of\nfallacious dialectics, they were taken seriously enough by their\nopponents to be regarded as threats to the order, stability and\nharmony of society. The later Mohists, in particular, whose views on\nlogic and language occupy the greater part of this entry, framed many\nof their own arguments in ways that are plausibly interpreted as\nresponses to their views, and probably many of the later\nMohists\u2019 own logical and linguistic insights are owed to the\nvery puzzles and frustrations they experienced in their efforts to\nsupplant these views with the honest integrity of more rigorous and\ntranspicuous ideas.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to distinguish the Mohists\u2019 logical\ninsights from their views on language in part because they made no\nattempt at investigating formal logic independently of their interests\nin analyzing the semantics of the terms of language (ming, or\n\u201cnames\u201d). They developed a clear theory of inference, and\nsupported this theory with versions of basic principles we would\nrecognize today as central to the study of logic, but argued that the\nrules governing inference are partly determined by the semantics of\nindividual terms and terms in combination, as opposed to rules merely\noperating on an argument\u2019s logical form. It is also difficult to\ndistinguish the Mohists\u2019 attempts at offering a descriptive account of\nthe content and function of language from their normative views about\nthe roles names should be expected to play if they are to contribute\nto the elevation of human character and proper conduct in society.\nThese normative views were held more broadly in early China, and they\nare especially clear in the writings of Xunzi, a Confucian scholar of\nthe late Warring States period who attempted to assimilate the key\ninsights of the Mohists on language and logic into a general Confucian\ntheory of ethics (Lin 2011). In Book 22 of the Xunzi\n(\u201cCorrect Naming\u201d), he explains:\n\n\nWhen with differences in expression and divergence in thought we\ncommunicate with each other, and different things are obscurely\nconfounded in name or as objects, the noble and the base will not be\nclarified, the same and different will not be distinguished; in such\ncases intent will inevitably suffer from frustration and obstruction.\nTherefore the wise made for them apportionments and distinctions and\ninstituted names to point out objects, in the first place in order to\nclarify noble and base, secondly to distinguish same and different.\nWhen noble and base are clarified, and same and different\ndistinguished, intent is not hampered by failure to communicate and\naction does not suffer from frustration and obstruction. This is the\npurpose of having names. (tr. Graham 1989)\n\n\nThe presupposition here is that people cannot live together\ncooperatively or harmoniously if they cannot communicate with one\nanother effectively\u2014if they are inadvertently calling different\nthings by the same names or the same things by different names. They\nwill think they are agreeing or disagreeing with one another when they\naren\u2019t, and their intentions will be frustrated or blocked\n\u2013 notably, not by the conflict of wills that would result from\nambition, greed or selfishness (which might be true apart from this),\nbut by something more basic: the dumb incompetence of failing to use\nlanguage properly. The solution, accordingly, is to determine the\ncorrect use of language, the proper conditions under which its terms\nare used. \u201cIs this object a horse?\u201d \u201cIs this ruler a\nking?\u201d As Xunzi indicates, part of the method here hinges on the\ndescriptive program of comparing objects in question to others that\nare referred to by the same names and making judgments of similarity\nor difference. But Xunzi goes deeper. To make a judgment of similarity\nor difference, certain criteria must be used. But what, in turn,\njustifies these criteria? Xunzi insists that the analysis of language\nmust also \u201cclarify the noble and base,\u201d and this seems\nintended as an answer to just this question; it explains why he\nidentifies it as his first basic purpose in the analysis of\nterms. For only then is one in a position to undertake the second\npurpose of distinguishing the same and the different. That is, we know\nthat a judgment of similarity or difference is correct when it\ndistinguishes the noble from the base, the good from the bad.\nXunzi\u2019s prioritizing of these two basic purposes suggests that\nthe ultimate aim of the investigation of language is to guide\nbehavior, to serve the normative function of providing standards for\nclarifying communicative intentions in a way that establishes a\njustificatory framework for resolving ethical disputes. Such a view\nseems to have been held widely in early China; it is suggested in the\nAnalects of Confucius in regards to the ordering of names,\nand it is clearly evident as a general orientation in the writings of\nthe Mohists, who hoped that the analysis of language would help to\nreveal semantic distinctions relevant to proper ethical conduct. The\nresult was an inevitable blending of disinterested analysis and\ndefinitional stipulation, insofar as it was held that language as a\nmedium for human discourse must not be neutral with respect to ethical\naims.\n\nGiven the great abundance of literature explicitly devoted to\ninterpreting and reconstructing early Chinese views on language, it is\nimpractical to attempt any exhaustive treatment here. To maintain\ncommon points of focus, attention will be restricted to those issues\nthat appear to have obvious bearing on early Chinese\nphilosophers\u2019 interest in logic, specifically as it pertains to\ntheories of reason and inference, generally construed. Our main\nquestions are: How did early Chinese philosophers\u2019 views about\nthe content and function of language contribute to their understanding\nof logic as the study of valid or correct inference? Secondly, in what\nway did their logical investigations influence their views about\nlanguage? Arguably, from the logician\u2019s point of view, the\ngreatest insights of early Chinese philosophers\u2019 studies of\nlogic and language are to be found in the later Mohists\u2019 studies\nof intensionality, which appear to have influenced not only their\nspecific theories on the efficacy of argumentation but also their core\nideas about the nature and purpose of language. Further remarks\naddress central points of disagreement the Mohists had with their\nDaoist critics, particularly as evident in the writings of\n Zhuangzi,\n and Xunzi\u2019s reinterpretation of Mohist logic from the vantage\npoint of his Confucian theory of ethics.\n", "toc": [{"#BackGeneCons": "1.

Background and General Considerations\n\nIt is generally recognized today that Chinese philosophy in its\nclassical period was much more preoccupied with articulating and\nsupporting philosophical positions through sustained rational\ndiscourse than was previously assumed. Part of the reason for this\noversight in decades past was due to the loss or neglect of ancient\ntexts critical to the understanding of early Chinese ideas on language\nand logic, particularly the writings of the later Mohists, who\ndeveloped a sophisticated school of philosophical and scientific\nthought in the third century BCE, but whose writings were rediscovered\nby philologists only in the late Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912). In\naddition to meticulously developing scientific theories about\ngeometry, mechanics, optics, and economics, the later Mohists also\narticulated detailed philosophical theories in areas we now recognize\nas logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language.\nTheir writings on language and logic are particularly noteworthy,\nsince the later Mohists appeared to treat these disciplines as\nembodying a subject matter worthy of independent study, and they\ndevoted more attention to issues about language and logic than any\nother school of thought of the same period. One finds in later Mohist\nwritings, for instance, the only detailed exposition of bian\n(disputation), the style of argumentation or debate likely practiced\nin all major schools of thought in ancient China (Fraser 2013). The\nlater Mohists aspired to become more proficient practitioners of\nbian by taking it more conscionably as an object of study,\nand carefully articulating, in the context of a general theory, the\nterms, rules, and methods for its practice.\n\nA second reason for this oversight is in the fact that those writings\nof classical Chinese philosophers that did largely survive the\nvicissitudes of history\u2014particularly the major works of Daoists\nlike Zhuangzi and Laozi, but also those writings attributable to\nConfucius and his philosophical descendants\u2014tend to embody what\nappear to be unfavorable appraisals of, or at least alternatives to,\nphilosophical methods that rely heavily on suppositions about the\npower of discursive rationality at establishing true ethical,\nmetaphysical, or scientific principles. Such methods take for granted\nthe aptitude of the human intellect to logically deduce true,\ninformative statements about particular objects, events, or states of\naffairs from general propositions, or establish correct\ngeneralizations by induction from particular instances, a practice\nless self-consciously avowed in most philosophical traditions in China\nthat were (unlike Mohism) stimulated by centuries of well-established\nsociocultural practices. Arguably, much of the interest we see in the\nstudy of logic in early Western philosophy was stimulated by the\nsupposition of a dichotomy between appearance and reality, which\nprompted philosophers to wonder whether judgments or theories about\nwhat appears to us do or do not correspond to the structure or content\nof a mind-independent, objective reality. The obvious case is Plato,\nwhose analysis of Forms was inspired by the methods of Euclidean\ngeometry with the intention that it be carried out in a realm of\nabstraction largely unimpeded by the diffuse and problematic content\nof sense experience. Aristotle lamented the fact that Plato\u2019s\nmethods suffered from limited applicability to the varieties of\nexperiential phenomena, believing instead that the content of\nperception does not pose any special problems for the reliability of\njudgment, but he retained a fundamental interest in the theory of\nrepresentation and hoped that his system of logic would provide proper\nnormative standards for drawing inferences among the categories we use\nto identify things.\n\nMost Chinese philosophers who lived after the unification of China in\n221 BCE, which was largely dominated by Confucianism after a brief\nperiod of suppression initiated by the First Emperor Qin Shi Huang, do\nnot appear to have had any special distrust of the content of the\nsenses, or were not responding to those who did, and so were not\ncompelled to view the veracity of representation as a problem of\nsignificance. Consequently, scholars have variously characterized\nChinese philosophical thought in ways that contrast it with Western\npreoccupations with discursive rationality. It is common, for example,\nto view early Chinese philosophers as largely preoccupied with\nproblems centering on the proper governance of society and how\ncitizens ought to conduct themselves within it. As much as in any\nother major philosophical tradition, the early Chinese philosophers\nwere concerned with questions about what kind of life is worth living\nand what things, circumstances, or actions are to be regarded as\nultimately valuable. Their philosophical investigations led them to\nconceptualize ideals of right conduct, appropriate behavior, and\nsocial propriety (Hall and Ames 1987). But the methods they employed\nto establish these ideals tended to emphasize reasoning by example\nfrom the actions or conduct of key moral exemplars rather than\ndeducing particular judgments of practical action from general\nprinciples. For this reason they were more preoccupied with\nidentifying proper normative standards by which to judge the\nsimilarity or resemblance of a thing or action with that of a chosen\nstandard. Arguably, this encouraged a conception of logic based mostly\non methods of inductive, analogical reasoning, given their special\nconcern with the problem of resemblance, and this view is borne out to\na large extent in the Mohists\u2019 more self-conscious appraisals of\ntheir own methodology and in the modes of reasoning they use to\nillustrate it (Yuan 2012; Fraser 2013).\n\nMoreover, the Mohists\u2019 term for reasoning or disputation,\nbian, appears in most other major philosophical texts of the\nClassical (or pre-Han) era, suggesting broad similarities in use. The\nterm is generally understood to mean \u201cdistinguishing\u201d or\n\u201cdrawing distinctions\u201d, although in its more specific uses\nwe find it variously understood as a process of conceptualizing\nsimilarities and differences, discriminating objects in acts of\nperception, appealing to normative linguistic standards for naming\nobjects, and using the normative criteria of correct naming as a\nproper guide to action (Fraser 2013). At the heart of these uses there\nappears to be a basic preoccupation with the philosophical importance\nof identifying the similarities and differences of things and events,\na process largely determined by cognitive skills associated with\npattern recognition. Unlike Aristotle, however, whose methods of\nclassifying things depended on assumptions about metaphysically real\nessences (independent of human agency), the early Chinese philosophers\nput the burden of correct discrimination at least partly on what they\ndeemed to be appropriate normative standards, based on the efficacy\nwith which they were thought to guide action. That is to say, which\nsimilarities and differences they thought were relevant depended on\nwhether they were thought to guide action in a way that is consistent\nwith general moral principles about right conduct. A central purpose\nof the ethical investigations of the Mohists, for example, was to\nidentify general standards of judgment that would reliably and\nimpartially guide action in a way that produces beneficial\nconsequences, and they appealed to bian as the principal\nhuman faculty for determining how these standards would play out in\nspecific cases. Practical reasoning was conceived as an ability to\nrespond appropriately on the basis of inferences drawn by analogy from\nvarious preconceived exemplars or models of moral action. According to\nBook 4 of the Mozi:\n\n\nThose in the world who perform tasks cannot do without models\n(fa) and standards. There is no one who can accomplish their\ntask without models and standards. Even officers serving as generals\nor ministers, they all have models; even the hundred artisans\nperforming their tasks, they too all have models.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Mohists do not seem to have found any reason to\ndoubt the assumption that this appeal to normative standards of\ndiscrimination (standards relevant to the efficacy of moral action) is\nstill grounded in the identification of real similarities and\ndifferences among objects, patterns of experience or perception that\ncould in principle be identified by any competent individual with\ndependable cognitive, perceptual, and linguistic capacities.\n\nThis way of summarizing the Mohist philosophical enterprise does leave\nunanswered important questions about the ultimate justification of\nethical claims. Early Chinese thought does not provide an explicit\ndistinction between fact and value, so it is a matter of controversy\nto determine which has epistemic priority in Mohist thought\u2014the\nnormative standards by which the correct uses of language guide\nbehavior, or the evaluations of reason that are determined by our\nability to ascertain real similarities and differences in perception\nand thought. This problem is perhaps less controversial in the\ninterpretation of Confucian philosophy because the priority of\nnormative standards in the Confucian program of ordering names is\nattested by clear examples. It is evident, for instance, in section\n1B/8 of the Mencius, which acknowledges the admissibility of\nkilling a wicked ruler in spite of the prohibition of regicide, on the\npremise that this ruler is not really a king (or does not\nwarrant the name \u201cking\u201d). The Confucian view is that\nanyone who is a king ought to act like one;\notherwise the name is unwarranted. Hence, correct naming is also a\nprescription for conduct.\n\nOne can appreciate, in this regard, why the Confucians insisted that\nthe correct use of names is a matter for authority to decide, because\nonly an appropriate authority can justify how one ought to act. This\nauthority was assumed to be found in the forms of ritual propriety\n(li) that were the common ingredients of established\ntraditions, or in the judgments or discretions of \u201cvirtuous\ngentlemen\u201d or other exemplars of moral conduct, and in this\nregard was considered to be \u2013 if not universal \u2013 then at least\nconstant, dependable and unifying. But the Mohists were skeptical, not\nhesitating to point out that tradition was not a strong enough\ncriterion for proper action. They knew, for instance, that social\npractices vary and conflict dramatically across time and place; how\ncan they all be \u201crighteous\u201d? Something independent of\nthese practices had to decide to serve as an objective criterion of\nmoral conduct. It is noteworthy that the Mohists themselves did appeal\nto an authority of sorts, in the abstract, quasi-godlike entity they\nreferred to as Heaven (tian), which they deemed to be the\nmost perfect moral agency. They referred to this agency as\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (tian zhi), believing that it could serve as the basis of an\nauthority independent of the variable and opposing opinions and social\npractices of people. But in later Mohist writings, particularly the\nMohist Canons, we find no mention of this agency, possibly\nbecause the Mohists found that their conception of it was not\nsubstantive enough to discriminate things at the level of\nphilosophical precision that they sought to address. Whatever the\ncase, they essentially divorced the justification of action from any\nauthoritative individual or entity that would otherwise serve to\nestablish it, and this raised new philosophical concerns about how the\nnorms of conduct and language use were to be decided. Central to\nMohist ethical thought are the principles of utility (an action is\nright depending on whether its consequences are useful) and universal\nlove (the usefulness of an action is determined by the impartial\nbeneficence it contributes to public welfare). So, according to the\nMohists, the moral description of an action depends partly (indeed,\nlargely) on whether it contributes to these ends, or whether these\nends may be judged appropriately analogous to the consequences of the\nactions of a moral exemplar. But the judgment of similarity here may\nitself depend on preexisting normative standards of correct use\nindependently of considerations of utility. Safe to say that since the\nMohist Canons do not explicitly address the issue of convention in\nlanguage, or its role in the justification of principles of naming,\nthe Mohists were probably undecided on this point. Not until the\nphilosophy of Xunzi do we find a clear consideration of this issue,\nbut Xunzi avoids the hard questions it exposes by deferring to the\nmore fastidious judgments of an intellectual elite.\n\nIt should be noted that those who rejected the Mohists\u2019 views\noften concentrated their objections on the logical presuppositions of\nthe Mohists\u2019 methodology of disputation by pointing out\ncounterexamples to the kinds of analogical inferences that the Mohists\nwere inclined to take for granted. A.C. Graham, for instance, who did\nmore than any other Western philosopher at reconstructing and\nanalyzing Mohist philosophical doctrines about language and logic in\nthe early decades following their rediscovery by Chinese philologists,\nnevertheless described the opposing Daoist philosophies (particularly\nas espoused in the Zhuangzi) as \u201canti-rational\u201d,\nrepresentative of an \u201cassault on reason\u201d, a\n\u201crejection\u201d, and even \u201cmockery\u201d, of logic\n(Graham 1989). Yet some argue that a great many of the Daoist\nobjections one finds in the Zhuangzi are motivated more by a\ngeneral skepticism about the possibility of identifying invariable\nstandards of discrimination in language than about ineradicable\ndefects in the very human capacity for reason. One can be a skeptic,\nfor instance, about the role of necessity in reference without having\nanything disparaging to say about our ability to evaluate the\nconsistency of a theory on logical grounds or reject it by the method\nof reductio ad absurdum. A number of scholars have even\nclaimed that Daoism, in particular, is not the anti-rational\nphilosophy it has been taken to be, but in some ways an attempt at\ncarrying the methods of reason to their ultimate limits, much as\nWittgenstein in his Tractatus attempts to tease out the\nboundary of the sayable through sustained rational reflection.\nZhuangzi, for all his skepticism about the utility of natural language\nas a medium for the representation of truth and inclinations towards\nmysticism, might nonetheless have still venerated reason,\nindependently of language, as the principal mode of thought through\nwhich one is able to discern right conduct in accordance with the Dao\n(or Way). This view is controversial, but scholars have not been\naverse to it (cf. the general view of Wing-tsit Chan: \u201cHe is\nmystical, but at the same time he follows reason as the leading\nlight\u201d, 1963: 177), and there seems to be an increasing interest\nin its viability (e.g., Alt 1991). Evidence for it is considered in\n section 4\n below.\n\nIt is clear that even if Daoism and other schools of thought\npositioned vis-\u00e0-vis Mohism in ancient China were in\nsome sense \u201canti-rational\u201d in orientation, their views\nwere not developed in isolation but were in fact a consequence of\nprolonged social contact and interaction with Mohist philosophers, and\nso could not have developed without being amply informed by their\nopponents\u2019 methods and views. This fact alone demands caution\nwhen making general statements about the logical and linguistic views\nof early Chinese philosophers working outside the Mohist tradition.\nOne can easily discern an increasing sophistication in methods of\ndisputation in traditions that did not exhibit a great interest in\nthematizing language and logic independently of other philosophical\npursuits, and this should not surprise us given the tumultuous period\nin which these traditions developed and the contentious struggles of\ntheir adherents for varying positions of social status and privilege.\nMengzi, for example, seeking to defend key ideas in Confucian thought,\ngoes beyond his forebears in advancing views on the goodness of human\nnature by appealing to more sharply formulated premises about innate\ndispositions for feeling and moral judgment against those asserting\nthat human nature is inherently neutral (2A6, and see Shun 1997 for an\nextensive analysis of argumentation in the Mencius text). By\nthe time Xunzi enters the fray near the end of the Warring States\nperiod we find rebuttals to Mencian thought that dig deep into what it\nis to have a disposition, how dispositions inform the possibilities of\nhuman behavior, and how we ought to act in response to them (e.g.,\nXunzi, Book 23). Far from simply explaining his views, Xunzi\nmarshals highly intelligible theories of semantics and reference in\ntheir defense, and he explicates these theories with punctilious\ndefinitions that are marked improvements over earlier formulations.\nAccording to Cua 1985, methods of disputation reach their highest\npoint in the writings of Xunzi, who in no small way benefited from the\nstandards of rigor that had emerged out of the ongoing disputes of his\npredecessors.\n\nThese developments notwithstanding, it is still important to recognize\nthat the demise of Mohism following the Warring States period appears\nto have squelched philosophical interest in the study of language and\nlogic mostly until modern times, when it was revived in 1894 the\nwritings of Sun Yirang (Graham 2003 [1978]: 70\u20132). Matters are\ncomplicated by the fact that logic as a unique object of study or\ndiscipline disentangled from other philosophical pursuits was\nhistorically awakened in Chinese philosophical thought only after the\nintroduction of Western philosophical notions and methods in the\n16th and 17th centuries. The Jesuit scholar\nMatteo Ricci, who first arrived in China in 1583, brought more than\nWestern science and literature; he introduced Euclid\u2019s\nElements to the Chinese and arranged a translation of it with\nthe assistance of the Chinese scholar Xu Guangqi. For these reasons,\nconsiderable caution has to be exercised in any attempt to reconstruct\nthe philosophical views of classical Chinese philosophers about\nlanguage and logic, to avoid anachronistically imposing notions that\nwere not part of their original philosophical programs (Garrett 1993).\nDebates surrounding these issues are very much alive today, with\ncontemporary scholars of Chinese philosophy tending to fall on one or\nthe other side of the general dispute about whether it is appropriate\nto utilize concepts, terms, distinctions, modes of expression, or\nmethods of analysis that may have been of foreign origin to interpret\nthe works of classical Chinese philosophers (see the entry\n comparative philosophy: Chinese and Western\n for further discussion).\n\nIt is indisputable that early Chinese philosophers of all major\nschools of thought were, at various points in their philosophical\ndevelopment, preoccupied to lesser and greater degrees with issues\ncentral to the philosophical studies of language and logic. However,\nwhether they pursued these issues in ways that were similar to, or\nvery different from, Western or other foreign orientations is a matter\non which no general consensus has been reached. Common notions in the\nphilosophical study of language include, for example, meaning, truth,\nreference, assertion, speech act, and propositional structure, notions\nthat may or may not translate successfully into the vocabulary\nemployed by early Chinese philosophers, given radical linguistic and\ncultural differences.\n\nLikewise, logic, construed as the study of inference, may have to be\nconceived differently from traditional Western accounts, given early\nChinese philosophers\u2019 rather unique approach to reasoning about\nlanguage as a normative guide to ethical judgment and action (for\nexample, as based on the doctrine of the ordering of names). It is not\nat all clear that early Chinese philosophers had a conception of logic\nthat involved the typical notions of truth, validity, entailment,\nconsistency, and so forth. Normally, an inference is conceived as a\nrule-bound transition of some kind from one sentence-like\nstructure\u2014a proposition, statement, or sentence\u2014to\nanother, and is considered valid if it preserves truth. However, there\nis some dispute about whether early Chinese philosophers were\npreoccupied with truth as a semantic concept, and even whether they\nconsidered sentences to be units of linguistic significance. On the\nother hand, contemporary developments of logic have opened up new\nvistas in the study of ancient ideas. Our primary concern in logic\nneed not be the preservation of truth, and different conceptions have\nbeen developed in which various conditions of satisfiability are\nemployed, with \u201cvalidity\u201d appropriately redefined. Caveats\nsuch as these admonish us to be open to alternative accounts of logic\nwhen interpreting the views of early Chinese philosophers, and to\nexercise caution when representing these views in contemporary\nnomenclature.\n\nNeedless to say, any solution to this debate will have to remain open\nnot only to research in the history of Chinese philosophy but also to\nadvances in the general studies of language, logic, cognition and\nhuman nature. Given the universality of language and logic as human\ncapacities or objects of use, can we assume that philosophers\ninterested in these topics will invariably identify, uncover, or\nutilize analogous concepts, presuppositions, or methods, regardless of\ntime, place, culture, or historical context, or that with conceptual\nadvances in their understanding of these topics, their views will\ninvariably converge? Answers to these questions will inform the\nmethodologies involved in contemporary research on classical Chinese\nthought, by compelling us to interpret the writings of early Chinese\nphilosophers from perspectives motivated by assumptions about either\nshared or divergent presuppositions, as the case may be.\n2. Confucius and the Ordering of Names\n\nThe Mohists are generally credited with the first systematic study of\nlanguage in ancient China, but the inspiration for putting language at\nthe center of philosophical thought certainly comes from Confucius\n(551?\u2013479? BCE). Against prevailing skepticism and apathy,\nConfucius insisted that the correct use of language is essential to\nthe order and harmony of society, and that the conditions by which\nlanguage is correctly used devolve upon determining how names\n(ming) designate objects, events, and actions. However, the\ncorrect use of names is not simply a matter of attaching labels to a\npreexisting domain of things independent of human affairs. That is, it\nis commonly recognized that Confucius viewed language as having not\nsimply a descriptive function, but a fundamentally performative one as\nwell. Attributing names to objects is not a matter of describing the\nworld, but of influencing it in a way that causes certain modes of\ninteraction and existence to be realized. One can do this poorly,\ncontributing to the degradation of social relationships and\none\u2019s relationship with nature, or skillfully, in a way that\ncontributes to social harmony and prosperity. The skillful use of\nlanguage depends on the extent to which one\u2019s use of it reflects\na conscientious awareness of the meanings and values that are\nessential to acting effectively. This goes hand-in-hand with the\nrealization that acting on behalf of these meanings and values is\nitself constitutive of the very relational efficacy one seeks to\nestablish.\n\nIn understanding this performative aspect of language one can\nappreciate why Confucius held that the ordering of society must begin\nwith the ordering of names. A famous exchange in the Analects\nexplains:\n\n\n\u201cWere the Lord of Wey to turn the administration of his state\nover to you, what would be your first priority?\u201d asked Zilu.\n\n\u201cWithout question it would be to insure that names are used\nproperly (zheng ming)\u201d, replied the Master.\n\n\u201cWould you be as impractical as that?\u201d responded Zilu.\n\u201cWhat is it for names to be used properly anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you can be so dense!\u201d replied Confucius. \u201cAn\nexemplary person (junzi) defers on matters he does not\nunderstand. When names are not used properly, language will not be\nused effectively; when language is not used effectively, matters will\nnot be taken care of; when matters are not taken care of, the\nobservance of ritual propriety (li) and the playing of music\n(yue) will not flourish; when the observance of ritual\npropriety and the playing of music do not flourish, the application of\nlaws and punishment will not be on the mark; when the application of\nlaws and punishments is not on the mark, the people will not know what\nto do with themselves. Thus, when the exemplary person puts a name to\nsomething, it can certainly be spoken, and when spoken it can\ncertainly be acted upon. There is nothing careless in the attitude of\nthe exemplary person toward what is said\u201d. (Analects\n13.3; tr. Ames and Rosemont 1998)\n\n\nScholars have often translated Confucius\u2019 expression cheng\nming as \u201crectification of names\u201d, but this\ntranslation has been widely supplanted with \u201cordering of\nnames\u201d to more explicitly reflect the continuously dynamic and\ncreative aspects of language use. Hall and Ames favor this latter\ntranslation, objecting to the former\u2019s suggestion that the\ncorrect use of names is a matter of conforming to preexisting\nconventions of proper use, \u201crectifying\u201d one\u2019s\nbehavior in light of these conventions. The moral dilemmas we face are\ncontext-dependent and continuously undergoing transformation, so\neffective moral action must be motivated by an awareness of these\ncontexts and assume different courses where appropriate. Accordingly,\nwhile the Confucian ideal of moral conduct involves an unflagging\nrespect for cultural institutions and the rituals embodied in them, it\nalso requires \u201cselectivity and creative synthesis\u201d, and\nthe recognition that \u201cinherited wisdom and institutions must be\nconstantly revamped to accommodate the shifting circumstances of an\nalways unique world\u201d (Hall and Ames 1987: 271\u20132).\n\nAlthough this doctrine brought language to the forefront of\nphilosophical inquiry, systematic debate on its function and\nproper use did not begin until the Mohists gained prominence as\nConfucianism\u2019s chief adversary. Departing from Confucian\northodoxy, the Mohists endeavored to justify their ethical views\nindependently of established customs on the basis of general\nprinciples, the articulation of which demanded a comprehensive theory\nof naming and reference.\n3. Mohist Views on Logic and Language\n\nThe Later Mohist writings in which logic and language are provided the\nmost extensive treatment are the entire four chapters of Book 10 and\nthe first two chapters of Book 11 of the Mo Zi (chapters\n40\u20135, collectively referred to as the Mohist Canons).\nThe chapters of Book 10 are known by the titles Jing Shang\n(Canons I), Jing Xia (Canons II), Jing\nShuo Shang (Expositions of the Canons I), and Jing\nShuo Xia (Expositions of the Canons II). In Book 11, we\nhave the Da Qu (Greater Selection) and the Xiao\nQu (Lesser Selection). The text of the Canons\nleaves a great deal unsaid; there are missing segments and obvious\ntextual errors, and interpretations of a number of critical passages\nhave exhibited widespread disagreement. For convenience, this entry\nfollows the widely recognized numbering system presented in Graham\n2003 [1978], which pairs each Canon with its corresponding\nExposition and identifies the passages from each pair by\nnumbers prefixed with the letters A and B. (For instance, passage B40\nof the Canons is from Canons II.) Graham\u2019s\nwork also reconstructs the Da Qu and the Xiao Qu\ninto a single corpus entitled Names and Objects (NO)\n(Graham 2003 [1978]), although there is controversy in his\nreconstruction of the Da Qu as a single body of writing,\ngiven the fragmentary state of many of its key sections.\n3.1 Basic Logical Notions\n\nA great deal of scholarship on Mohist logic in the past 50 years has\nbeen devoted to explicating Mohist texts with the purpose of\nidentifying basic similarities with Western logical notions or\nprinciples (e.g., Zong 2000), or arguing that among the Mohists\u2019\nbasic aims was a program for developing a formal theoretical apparatus\ncomparable to, say, Aristotle\u2019s categorical logic or the\nelementary propositional logic of the Stoics (e.g, Zhang and Liu\n2007). Alternatively, it has been claimed that embodied in the\nMohists\u2019 account of disputation (bian) was in fact a\ntheory of logical analysis motivated by a desire to deduce particular,\ninformative statements about the world from general propositions\n(Harbsmeier 1998). According to Harbsmeier, \u201cThe aim of logical\nanalysis was to establish a correct description of the\nworld\u201d.\n\nIn spite of textual errors and incompleteness, there is no dearth of\nmaterial in Mohist texts that is highly suggestive of these\nsimilarities. In developing their views on disputation from its\nlogical roots, the Mohists appear to have made conscientious and\nregular use of logical operators that are commonly found in\ntoday\u2019s propositional calculi, including conjunction\n(yu), disjunction (ruo), a variety of articles and\nverbs for negation (e.g., wu, fei, bu), and\nimplication (variously indicated with ze, ran hou,\nand other devices). They gave special attention to quantificational\nnotions, taking \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnone\u201d (mo)\nas a primitive (or undefined) notion and in A43 defining\n\u201call\u201d (jin) in terms of it: \u201cAll is none\nnot being so\u201d or, in modern notation, \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\\n=_{\\mathit{df}}\\ \\mathrm{N}x\\mathord{\\sim}\\varphi\\). Furthermore, in\ntheir Greater Selection (Da Qu), they use\n\u201call\u201d to define \u201csome\u201d: \u201cSome is not\nall\u201d (NO5), quite possibly with the definition\n\\(\\exists x\\varphi\\ =_{\\mathit{df}}\\ \\mathord{\\sim}\\forall\nx\\mathord{\\sim}\\varphi \\) in mind (although textual incompleteness\nwarrants caution on this point; Robins 2010 translates it as\n\u201cSome is not exhaustive\u201d). They employed special terms for\nmodality, using bi (necessity), for example, as an adverbial\nrelation between two things, where one can be said to be the necessary\ncomplement of another (e.g., elder brother and younger brother). And\nsome scholars have suggested that the Mohists took steps toward\nformalizing their logical views by conscientiously employing variables\nand other devices that are capable of functioning in the same\ngrammatical role, such as indefinite and demonstrative pronouns (e.g.,\nLiu and Zhang 2010). These views are plausible, but support for them\nis hampered by the fact that the texts do not present them in an\norganized fashion, but mention them variously in passing as other\nviews more central to their theoretical program are developed.\n3.2 Principles of Reason and Inference\n\nBeyond these superficial similarities with the basic logical notions\nof contemporary formal-theoretical systems, there is a great deal of\nmaterial in the Mohist Canons that is indisputably concerned\nwith articulating logical principles, but whose interpretation is\nstill highly debatable. Scholars have extrapolated from Mohists texts\nversions of principles common to Western systems of symbolic logic,\nsuch as basic rules of inference (modus ponens, modus\ntollens, hypothetical syllogism), necessary and sufficient\nconditions, the laws of non-contradiction and excluded middle, and\nreductio ad absurdum. Intriguingly, we also find what appears\nto be a formulation of the liar paradox, first attributed in the West\nto Eubulides in the 4th century BCE: \u201cTo claim that\nall saying contradicts itself is self-contradictory. Explained by:\nwhat he says himself\u201d (B71). It is hard to believe that the\nMohists had anything in mind here but a precise notion of logical\ninconsistency.\n\nObservations such as these might encourage the view that the later\nMohists were uncovering basic principles of reasoning that we all\nshare, regardless of culture or history. For instance, using their\nstock examples of \u201cox\u201d and \u201cnon-ox\u201d for\ncontrary terms, the Mohists assert of any general kind that\n\n\n[o]ne calling it \u201cox\u201d and the other \u201cnon-ox\u201d\nis \u201ccontending over claims which are the converse of each\nother\u201d,\n\n\nand that\n\n\n[s]uch being the case, they do not both fit the fact. (A74)\n\n\nIf these statements are really about converse claims, as\nGraham\u2019s translation contends (e.g., \u201cThis is an\nox\u201d, and \u201cThis is a non-ox\u201d), then the Mohists\nappear be to asserting something quite like a version of the principle\nof non-contradiction formulated in Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, in which it is stated of any two contradictory\npropositions that they cannot both be true simultaneously (IV 6\n1011b13\u201320, Kirwan 1993). Moreover, B35 appears to recognize\nthat they cannot both be false (\u201cTo say that there is no winner\nin disputation necessarily does not fit the fact\u201d), suggesting a\nversion of the principle of excluded middle.\n\nStill, it is hasty to assume any resemblance here amounts to an\nequivalence. Aristotle\u2019s principles are grounded in a theory of\npredication that is anything but neutral with respect to the basic\nstructure of a proposition. A categorical proposition has a\nsubject-predicate structure that partly determines whether or not it\nis true, and this structure contributes to the explanation of the\nassertoric force of this proposition when asserted. There is no clear\nevidence that the Mohists were making a point here about truth, if\ntruth is conceived as a semantic property of propositions that have a\nsubject-predicate structure. Indeed, some scholars have rejected the\nidea that a subject-predicate structure is a necessary condition of\nsentences of even contemporary Chinese, let alone is classical forbear\n(e.g., Han 2009). Tiles and Yuan (2004) argue that the\nsubject-predicate structure of Aristotle\u2019s categorical\npropositions only makes sense against the backdrop of a classificatory\nsystem in which things are categorized in terms of genera and species,\nsomething absent in early Chinese philosophers\u2019 emphasis on\ncontext-dependent relationships among things in varying fields of\nfocus. That is, to assert \u201cThis is an ox\u201d is not to\nidentify a substance in terms of a species of things to which it\nbelongs, but to make an association between one thing and other things\nwith the same name according to a presupposed criterion or standard,\nwhich varies depending on the context in which the association is\nmade. More fundamentally, A.C. Graham claims that the proposition was\na philosophical discovery only of the later Mohists, with their\nearlier counterparts primarily interested in teasing out the\nphilosophical implications of individual terms and their combinations\nin expressions (2003 [1978]). But in his view this discovery did not\nlead to an analysis of subject-predicate structure. Chad Hansen (1983)\neven rejects the view that early Chinese philosophers were concerned\nwith articulating theories of truth, suggesting instead that their\nprimary focus was on the pragmatic, behavior-guiding functions of\nlanguage, and how these functions contribute to normative views about\nproper ethical discourse and conduct.\n\nThese important questions aside, it is clear that the Mohists had a\nprimary interest in determining the conditions under which two or more\nobjects may be regarded as the same (tong) or different\n(yi). Correlatively, they looked for conditions in which an\nobject is admissibly characterized as of a certain kind. This prompted\nthe Mohists to recognize names of different types, three in\nparticular: unrestricted (da), classifying (lei),\nand private (si). In A78 the Mohists assert that\n\u201cnaming something \u2018horse\u2019 is classifying it\u201d,\nand that \u201cfor \u2018what is like the object\u2019 we\nnecessarily use this name\u201d, indicating that the name\n\u2018horse\u2019 applies to a class of objects that are in some\nsense relevantly similar. By contrast, \u201cnaming someone\n\u2018Zang\u2019\u201d (or, say, the proper name\n\u2018Jack\u2019) \u201cis \u2018private\u2019\u201d, a\n\u201cname which stays confined to this object\u201d. Names that are\n\u201cprivate\u201d refer to single individuals and no others. These\ntwo kinds of names are distinguished from the universal\n\u2018thing\u2019, of which the Mohists assert, \u201cany object\nnecessarily (bi) requires this name\u201d.\n\nWith this, the Mohist art of disputation concentrates on pairs of\ncomplementary names (e.g., \u201cox\u201d and \u201cnon-ox\u201d)\nto determine which is admissibly applied to an object. Together, the\ntwo names in each pair partition all that exists into two mutually\nexclusive categories. Any given object is in one or the other category\nof each pair, but not both. Accordingly, the names of each pair cannot\nboth \u201cfit\u201d the object, nor can it be the case that neither\nfits. It is in these terms that the Mohists recognized what we would\nidentify as the principles of non-contradiction and excluded middle.\nTheir primary interest is with naming and reference, and only\nconsequentially are they drawn into reflections on meaning. In an act\nof reference, one\u2019s utterance of \u201cThis is an ox\u201d\nmight be explained as the expression of a proposition in a speech act\nwith assertoric force. But this explanation depends on a general\ntheory about the relation between reference and meaning, something the\nMohists did not explicitly investigate. Their increasing interest in\nhow names combine into meaningful wholes may have put them on the\nverge of developing such a theory, but their focus remained mostly at\nthe level of particular acts of naming and uses of words. This makes\nit an open question whether or to what extent the logical principles\nunderwriting their specific views on reference, and their general\ntheory of language, are adequately characterized in Aristotelian terms\nor in some other way.\n\nInference is commonly understood as a syntactic operation on the form\nof a sentence or assertion that preserves the semantic property of\ntruth. Aristotle\u2019s logic, in which validity is determined by an\nargument\u2019s categorical form independently of the truth of its\npremises and the semantics of its terms, is an example. Like most\nother early Chinese philosophers, the Mohists do not appear to have\nconceived of valid inference in this way. Even as they gave increasing\nattention to matters of logical or grammatical form, they remained\nskeptical that different categories of form can be regarded as an\ninvariable guide to meaning. In particular, they were consistently\nwary of assuming that the meaning of a sentence or complex is\ndetermined by the meanings of its constituent parts and their modes of\ncombination. For this reason they maintained that valid inference is\npartly a semantic affair, hinging on our consideration of the\nidiosyncrasies of meanings in combination. So rather than developing a\ntheory of inference strictly on the basis of appeals to logical or\nlinguistic form, they instead sought to develop a viable\nclassification of what they took to be valid inference patterns based\non analogies in the semantics of terms in combination (see\n section 3.4\n below).\n\nThis prioritizing of semantics over formal logic had the effect of\nencouraging a rather different conception of argumentation based\nmainly on patterns of analogical reasoning, which the Mohists referred\nto as bian. Fraser 2013 argues that bian is\nunderstood in classical Chinese texts with an assortment of meanings\nof different levels of generality. Broadly speaking, it refers to\nprocesses of reasoning and disputation, basic operations of cognition,\nand the means by which we acquire knowledge. But in its more specific\nuse it involves correlating things based on their similarities and\ndifferences, and drawing conclusions from the distinctions thus\nestablished. Given that objects are found to resemble one another in\ndifferent ways, we correlate them consistently only in virtue of a\nmodel or standard (fa), which the Mohists define in A70 of\nthe Canons as \u201cthat in being like which something is\nso\u201d. By ascertaining the resemblance relation between other\nobjects and the standard, we apply the name consistently and identify\na class. Thus, to answer the question of whether or not we should\npredicate of something x the name G, the Mohists\nwould typically identify a model m (a particular object) for\nG, and then inquire whether x resembles the model.\nIf it does, then they would assert \u201cx is\nG\u201d as a consequence.\n\nThe Mohist conception of valid inference may depart from many Western\naccounts in another way as well. Given their prevailing tendency to\nregard the action guiding significance of language as its principal\nfunction, the Mohists were likely compelled to think of the semantic\nproperty that is preserved in valid inference not simply in\ndescriptive terms, but in normative ones as well. It is for this\nreason that scholars of early Chinese philosophy often prefer to\ntranslate the Chinese evaluative term ke as\n\u201cadmissibility\u201d, as opposed to \u201ctruth\u201d, since\nthe Mohist conception of the correct use of a sentence was closely\ntied to presuppositions about proper social conduct. In this way,\nvalid inference was construed as having complex justificatory import.\nFor instance, in claiming that an action x is humane\n(ren) by its resemblance with the conduct of a sage, one is\nalso providing justification for it as such, because one is asserting\nin the act of naming that it resembles the model for humane action,\nand resembling this model is the very condition that justifies calling\nit such. (Recall again that naming something is classifying it, such\nthat for anything else that is like it one is obligated to use the\nsame name.) Moreover, asserting that x is humane justifies\nthe claim that it ought to be recognized as such, because the\nmodel which it resembles (in being a model) is the very\njustification for how the name ought to be used. Its resemblance\ncarries with it the normative requirement that language users\nrecognize it as such, for that is what would be expected of a language\nwhose principal function is to guide behavior and encourage proper\nsocial conduct. Arguably, the English terms \u201cadmissible\u201d\nand \u201cinadmissible\u201d come closer to capturing this notion\nthan the more neutral terms \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cfalsehood\u201d.\n3.3 Methods of Application and Problems\n\nGiven this appeal to resemblance for valid inference, we can perhaps\nsee why the Mohists\u2019 semantical investigations took priority\nover the analysis of logical form. Determining whether x is\nG depends on whether it resembles the model m, but\nobjects can resemble one another in different ways, and imperfectly.\nTo use one of the Mohists\u2019 own examples, a man may resemble the\nchosen standard of a \u201cblack man\u201d because he has black\nhair, but we would not for that reason call him a black man. He would\nhave to resemble the standard \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d\n(yi), as determined by a criterion (yin)\n(A95\u20137). Similarly, a square piece of wood resembles a\ncarpenter\u2019s T-square (taken as a model) in virtue of its\nsquareness, not its being wood (B65). A horse is big not because its\neyes are big, but because its body is, whereas it is blind because of\nits eyes, not its body (Xiao Qu [NO18]). The Mohists\ngenerally identify these criteria by appeal to discriminations\ndirectly evident in perception or based on ideas parasitic on acts of\nperception (such as the mental image of a square). But bian\nis more than just a term for the discriminatory acts of perception; it\nis about the business of naming objects in virtue of appropriate\ndiscriminations, and the application of a name cannot be regarded as\ncorrect without an appeal to its semantic content. This is less\nevident with simple terms like \u201chorse\u201d or\n\u201csquare\u201d, whose practical applications are plain enough to\npreclude any conscious reflection on meanings. But it was surely at\nthe forefront of the Mohists\u2019 minds in their consideration of\nterms with abstract content and complex expressions, like\n\u201cbeneficence\u201d, \u201cutility\u201d, and \u201cuniversal\nlove\u201d.\n\nFor instance, a consequence of the Mohists\u2019 doctrine of\nuniversal love is that \u201cloving people\u201d (ai ren)\nrequires loving all people without exception, a criterion that is\nquantificationally different from that of \u201criding horses\u201d\n(cheng ma), which requires only that a person ride at least\none horse (Xiao Qu [NO17]). These expressions are\nsimilar grammatically, but the Mohists analyzed their quantificational\ncontent differently, something not given merely in the analysis of\nperception. So the Mohists\u2019 research program was one of\ncoordinating similarities and differences given in perception with\ndivisions determined in the analyses of the semantics of terms. The\nresult is the determination of criteria that fix the relations between\nobjects and their chosen models (cf. A97). To be sure, questions\nabound in attempting to suitably refine these criteria to apply them\nconsistently (the perceptual content of the world may be infinitely\ncomplex), but this is precisely what gave the Mohists\u2019\nphilosophical research program its impetus. (For a fascinating essay\non issues arising out of attempts at modeling in modern nomenclature\nMohist conceptions of reasoning about yi, see Liu, Seligman,\nand van Benthem 2011.) For the Mohists, such practical concerns with\nthe relations between names and objects superseded investigations into\nlogical form.\n\nOn the other hand, while the analysis of logical form might not have\nbeen the Mohists\u2019 primary theoretical concern, we should not\ntake this to imply that their philosophical pursuits did not involve\nample deductive reasoning. Lucas 2020 provides several examples of\nargumentative passages from Mohist texts that appear \u201calmost ready\nmade\u201d for formalization and which are easily regimented in a way that\ndemonstrates either their deductive validity or inductive soundness.\nIndeed, the Mohists seem to have presupposed as a paradigm of\ngood reasoning a form of inference that is purely deductive. Note that\nthe Mohists assert \u201cx is G\u201d as a\nconsequence of x\u2019s resemblance with the model\nm for G, but this only follows logically with the\naddition of a further general principle, something like\n\u201cAnything x that resembles the model m for\nG is G\u201d. This principle might not have been\nrendered explicit in their logical investigations, but their assertion\nthat x is G does not follow without its\npresupposition or something logically equivalent to it, and they did\nmake a distinguished place for quantifiers among their basic logical\nnotions. So assuming that the model for G is m, the\nMohists appear to have taken the following (or something equivalent to\nit) as a paradigmatic form of reasoning formally justifying the\napplication of names to objects:\n\n\nAnything resembling the model m for G is\nG.\n\nSomething x resembles m.\n\nTherefore, something x is G.\n\n\nThis argument is deductively valid, and it seems highly improbable\nthat the Mohists were not employing something like it in their\nassertions about the correct methodology for resolving disputes by\nbian. So, it would be highly misleading to say that the\nMohists were simply not doing logic of the kind with which we are\nfamiliar today. That they were not formalizing a theory of logical\nform does not imply that they were not engaged in rigorously defending\ntheir views on the basis of principles that involve or presuppose\nvalid deductive reasoning and other basic methods of logic. To be\nsure, that the Mohists did not articulate this pattern of reason\nexplicitly could support the claim that their use of it was little\nmore than a trivial exercise of our unconscious aptitude for deductive\nreason, and hence unwarranted as a distinctive feature of their\nphilosophy. Even if this is true, however, its consistency with the\ntext makes it not unlikely that they were on the verge of discovering\nit, for they did endeavor to provide analyses of linguistic form,\nwhich point in the direction of formalization, and with the apparent\nintention of testing theories about various patterns of inference (see\n section 3.4\n below).\n\nGoing with this idea, it has been suggested that the Mohists did\nrealize a distinction between predicates and singular terms in their\nclassification of names: recall that in A78 lei refers to\nnames that classify (they may be true or admissible of many things,\nlike predicates), whereas si refers to names that are fixed\nto individual objects (like singular terms). When we add the Mohists\u2019\nthird category, unrestricted (da), we have a set of names\nthat Lucas (2020) identifies as corresponding to the three basic\nsyntactic categories that are common to the notations of formal logic:\nindividual variables (whose values may be unrestricted), predicates\n(whose values are determined extensionally by classes), and individual\nconstants (or singular terms, whose values are fixed to individual\nobjects). This gives us some liberty, at least, for thinking of simple\nMohist statements in terms of the basic form of predication\n\u201c\\(F(a)\\)\u201d, and even for allowing for the use of\nquantifiers and variables, \\(\\forall x(\\textit{F}x)\\)and \\(\\exists\nx(\\textit{F}x)\\).\n\nIt was noted above that for the Mohists our capacity to correlate\nobjects in various ways is exercised when we name particular objects\nand then apply these names to all objects that are analogous to them.\nWe correlate objects consistently in virtue of a model fa\n(\u201cthat in being like which something is so\u201d) (A70), and we\nidentify a class from this model by ascertaining the resemblance\nrelation between it and other objects. Indeed, according to Graham, by\nidentifying an object as a \u201chorse\u201d based on its\nresemblance with the standard for horses, we are in effect treating\nthe name ma (\u201chorse\u201d)\n\n\nas an abbreviation of \u201csomething which is like the\nobject\u201d, the object being the particular for which the name is\nordained. (2003 [1978]: 325)\n\n\nHence, on this interpretation, when the Mohists say you ma\n(\u201cThere is a horse\u201d), or \\(\\exists x(\\textit{Horse}(x))\\),\nthey are, in effect, making an assertion that the particular object to\nwhich they are referring is such that it correctly resembles the model\nfor horses. (The term you would have been taken to imply\nexistence.) That is to say,\n\n(P1)\nThere is an object x such that x resembles the\nmodel m for horses.\n\n\nWe can extend this idea to assertions of Classical Chinese of the form\n\u2018F G ye\u2019, which we gloss here as \u201cAll\nF are G\u201d, or \u201cF are\nG\u201d (with F functioning as a generic\nquantifier). For example, taking the expression bai ma\n(\u201cwhite horse\u201d) to represent \u201cany x that\nresembles the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse\u201d and ma\n(\u201chorse\u201d) for \u201cany x that resembles the\nmodel \\(m_2\\) for horse\u201d, the basic form of the assertion\n\u201cWhite horses are horses\u201d would be:\n\n(P2)\nAny x that resembles the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse\nresembles the model \\(m_2\\) for horse.\n\n\nThis seems to captures the Mohists\u2019 view for basic nominal\nassertions, but there are problems with it, however. Resemblance is\nnormally construed as a relation that is both reflexive and symmetric.\nNotice that the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse resembles itself, if\n\\(\\forall x(\\textit{Resembles}(x,x))\\) is assumed. In virtue of P2,\nthe model \\(m_1\\) resembles the model \\(m_2\\). Since the color white\nis irrelevant to the criterion required for the resemblance to\n\\(m_2\\), it must be in virtue of its shape that \\(m_1\\) resembles\n\\(m_2\\). (Shape is a common example the Mohists use to distinguish\nhorses when color is irrelevant.) But then, given symmetry,\n\n\\[ \\forall x\\forall y(\\textit{Resembles}(x,y) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{Resembles}(y,x)), \\]\n\n\n\\(m_2\\) resembles \\(m_1\\), by the same criterion. This would warrant\nthe conclusion that any model \\(m_i\\) that satisfies the requisite\ncriterion of shape for \u201chorse\u201d would warrant the name\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d, regardless of its color. Hence, a model\nthat is brown would warrant the name \u201cwhite horse\u201d.\n\nThese are undesirable consequences of this view, but they do follow on\nstandard analyses of resemblance. Did the Mohists really intend it\nthis way? More careful exegesis suggests probably not, but scholarship\non Mohist thought has tended to gloss over semantic subtleties in\nfailing to recognize that in Classical Chinese the term for\nresemblance (tong) is highly polysemous, with different\nmeanings that the Mohists endeavored to distinguish (Fung 2020b). In\nA86\u20137 of the Canons the Mohists articulate four\ndistinct senses of sameness or resemblance (tong), along with\ndifference (yi), corresponding roughly to the notions of\nbeing identical, being the units of a whole or class, constituting the\nsame object, and being of the same kind:\n\nSameness: Identical, as units, as together, as of a kind.\n\nNote the inclusion of identity; the Mohists use tong\nvariously much in the way the copula \u201cis\u201d functions in\nEnglish. What is obvious from the explanations they provide of these\nterms is that, however much their stock illustrations appeal to acts\nof perception, the Mohists are using their technical term\ntong much more broadly than mere perceptual likeness. They\ninclude identity, as noted, as when two names refer to the same thing\nor have the same extension (gou \u201cdog\u201d and\nquan \u201ccanine\u201d were typical examples). Moreover,\nnot only may two horses appear alike perceptually (being of the same\nshape or having four legs), but a hand may be \u201cthe same\nas\u201d Mozi (being a part of Mozi) or the same as another part of\nMozi, the hardness and whiteness of a stone may be the same in partly\nconstituting the same object (\u201cas together\u201d), and Mozi may\nbe \u201cthe same as\u201d a human (in that he is \u201cof the\nkind\u201d human). These examples make it evident, moreover, that\ntong was intended to cover both mereological and member-set\nrelations (cf. Fraser 2007). Such relations are obviously not always\nsymmetrical, and while there is no direct evidence that the Mohists\nwere perplexed by the specific problem posed above, it is evident that\ntheir own definitions provided them with various means of\nresponse.\n\nFor purposes here, one way to do this is to adopt the generic notion\nof an admissible substitute, taking care to provide criteria of\nadmissibility that is inclusive enough to capture the points in the\nanalysis above. For instance, any white horse can stand as an\nadmissible substitute for the model for \u201chorse\u201d, but it is\nnot true that any horse can serve as an admissible substitute for\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d.\n\n(P3)\nAny x that is an admissible substitute for the model\n\\(m_1\\) for F is an admissible substitute for the model\n\\(m_2\\) for G.\n\n\nWhy do some things count as admissible substitution instances but not\nothers? More specifically, what is it in virtue of a thing that makes\nit \u201cresemble\u201d something else? The Mohists do give many\nillustrations of relevant criteria, making it evident that there are\ndifferent kinds; shape, color, and function are common examples. As\nnoted above, we judge the squareness of a piece of wood by the\nsimilarity of its shape with a carpenter\u2019s T-square, and say\nthat a horse is white because of its color, not its shape. We also\njudge that a horse is blind because its eyes are impaired in their\nfunction.\n\nIndeed, given that the Mohists did not claim to provide an exhaustive\nlist of these criteria, and that the text refers to them mainly by way\nof example (T-squares, blind horses), the door is open to the view\nthat virtually anything can stand as a criterion of resemblance and\nmay even be regarded as \u201cappropriate\u201d depending on the\ncontext of reference.\n\nMou (2016) argues that the Mohists identified these criteria through\nfeatures of salience in variable fields of cognitive focus: an aspect\nof a thing can stand as a criterion of resemblance provided only that\nwe, as language users, single it out either through an act of\nperception or through a mental act in which one\u2019s attention is\nconcentrated inward (such as on a mental image). Furthermore, this\naspect may be used appropriately in that the judgments we make may be\ntrue or false depending on whether it is singled out in such an\nattentive act. For example, the judgment \u201cA white horse is not a\nhorse\u201d may be deemed false if the salient aspect of our mental\nfocus is on the \u201chorse-ness\u201d feature of each entity\nindicated (white horse and horse). But it may also be deemed true if\nthe salient aspect is \u201cwhiteness\u201d, since whiteness is a\nfeature that may be true of some horses but not others.\n\nMou\u2019s account situates this view in the context of an account of\nreference that requires two joint determinants in every referential\nact: (1) an undifferentiated semantic-whole that is referred to\nindependently of any particular aspect or feature, and (2) a\nparticular aspect or feature that is rendered salient by our faculties\nof attention. Mou argues that this dual-reference account provided the\nMohists with the flexibility to determine the truth or falsehood of\njudgements variously by situating each determination in a context that\narises out of the many \u2013 perhaps infinite \u2013 ways in which\nwe can identify things. At the same time, this account was also\nintended to provide an objective ground for the determination of the\ntruth of our judgments by requiring that reference (and correlatively\nour knowledge of the identities of objects) be determined in each act\nby a mind-independent whole from which any particular aspect is\nidentified.\n\nWhether or not the Mohists held anything like this dual-reference\naccount, it is clear that which criteria the Mohists found relevant\ndepended on what they found \u201cappropriate\u201d in comparisons\nof things, and the identification of these criteria was no doubt both\na central part of the Mohists\u2019 research program and a source of\nongoing controversy in debates with their opponents. But given the\nsubtlety with which the Mohists analyzed their key terms, they seem to\nhave been increasingly sensitive to the worry that no exhaustive list\nis possible.\n\nMoreover, they were aware that simple terms might have complex or\npolysemous meanings, and that the problems of analysis are compounded\nas terms are combined into larger expressions. As a result, it became\nincreasingly evident that complex expressions of the same grammatical\nform can have different conditions of satisfaction. An example from\nthe Lesser Selection (Xiao Qu) noted above comes\nfrom their analysis of the expressions \u201cloving people\u201d\n(ai ren) and \u201criding horses\u201d (cheng\nma):\n\n\nLoving people requires loving all people without exception, only then\nis this called loving people. Not loving people does not require\nloving no people at all; it is (rather) not loving all people without\nexception, and by this it is called not loving people. Riding horses\ndoes not require riding all horses without exception; it is (rather)\nriding some horses, and by this it is called riding horses. But not\nriding horses does require riding no horses at all; only by this is it\ncalled not riding horses. These are cases in which something applies\nwithout exception in one case but not in the other. (Xiao Qu;\ntr. Graham 2003 [1978])\n\n\nThe Mohists are pointing out here that the predicate \u201cloves\npeople\u201d is satisfied only by those who happen to love all\npeople, whereas the predicate \u201crides horses\u201d is satisfied\nby anyone who happens to ride at least one horse. By the same token,\nthe predicate \u201cdoes not love people\u201d is satisfied by\nanyone who fails to love at least one person, whereas the predicate\n\u201cdoes not ride horses\u201d requires that one ride no horses at\nall. To take another example, the Mohists observe that the name for\n\u201cboth\u201d (ju) works differently in combination with\ndifferent names; we say \u201cThey both fight\u201d (ju\ndou), but not \u201cThey both are two\u201d (ju er).\nAgain, while the name fu means \u201chusband\u201d on its\nown, its combination with yong yields the sense \u201cbrave\nman\u201d (yong fu) without any reference to a husband,\nindicating that complex meanings are not necessarily mere products of\ntheir constituent parts (B3). Revelations such as these prompted what\nis aptly characterized as a linguistic turn in Mohist philosophy, as\nthe Mohists concentrated their attention on language itself and the\nimplications its grammatical forms have on the analysis of\nmeaning.\n3.4 The Mohist Linguistic Turn\n\nThe Mohist program was beset with two basic kinds of problems. First,\nin the domain of reference, the Mohists encountered difficulties in\ntheir method of \u201cextending kinds\u201d. This was the problem of\nidentifying appropriate salience conditions in perception and thought\nto serve as criteria for naming the similar similarly and the\ndifferent differently. Second, in the domain of meaning, they faced\nunexpected questions in their evaluations of the meanings of names in\ncomplex expressions, suggesting problems in extending their theory of\nreference from simple terms to complex expressions on the assumption\nthat the latter are to be treated compositionally. One can see how the\nMohists\u2019 preference for reasoning by analogy, and the problems\nbeleaguering their quest for certainty, would have encouraged them to\nadopt the same orientation with respect to the study of language\nitself, its grammatical forms and their implications for meaning. They\nturned their attention to the study of language in hopes that more\nsophisticated analyses of meaning would help resolve some of the\nproblems afflicting their account of reference. But one would also\nexpect the Mohists to remain apprehensive here about making general\nstatements, just as they found was necessary in their analysis of\nreference, and this is exactly what we find in the later writings of\nthe Canons, particularly in the Lesser Selection\n(Xiao Qu), the compilation most noteworthy for its novel\ninsights in the study of language.\n\nOn the surface, the Mohist program for language is to put together an\ninventory of parallel linguistic constructions with the expectation\nthat the logic implicated in their meanings will at least partly track\ntheir grammatical form. But the Mohists\u2019 recognition that\njudgments about resemblance involve uncertainty convinced them that\nany method of disputation based on analogies in grammatical form is\nnot inherently reliable. They explain:\n\n\nThings have respects in which they are similar, yet it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that they are completely similar. Parallels between expressions\nare correct only up to a point. When things are \u201cso\u201d,\nthere is that by which they are \u201cso\u201d. Their being\n\u201cso\u201d is the same, but that by which they are\n\u201cso\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the same. When people accept\nthings, there is that by which they accept them. Their accepting them\nis the same, but that by which they accept them isn\u2019t\nnecessarily the same. Hence, expressions in analogies, parallelizing,\n\u201cpulling\u201d, and \u201cpushing\u201d become different as\nthey proceed, become dangerous as they change direction, fail when\ntaken too far, and separate from their root as they flow, and so one\ncannot be careless and cannot invariably use them. Thus statements\nhave many methods, separate kinds of different reasons, and so one\ncannot look at only one side. (Lesser Selection [Xiao\nQu])\n\n\nThe Mohists are crisscrossing here between reference and meaning,\nbetween the problems they observe in their analogical theory of naming\nand those they now identify in their theory of linguistic parallels.\nPresumably, the Mohist expression \u201cbeing so\u201d\n(ran) is a reference to \u201cbeing of a certain\nkind\u201d, and \u201cthat which makes it so\u201d refers to the\nconditions under which a thing is admissibly considered to be of that\nkind. Recall the Mohist observation that objects may resemble one\nanother but not be of the same kind, because they do not resemble one\nanother \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d. Here the Mohists appear\nto be making the correlative point that two objects may be of the same\nkind (\u201ctheir being \u2018so\u2019 is the same\u201d), while\nthe conditions that warrant their being treated as of the same kind\nare not necessarily the same. In the domain of meaning, the Mohists\nare making the same point: expressions in language may have the same\ngrammatical form, but the conditions by which they are admissibly\napplied might be different.\n\nThe passage quoted above makes a passing reference to four techniques\nof disputation commonly recognized by the Mohists and their\ninterlocutors. The four techniques are listed explicitly in the\nLesser Selection with explanations:\n\n\nAnalogy (pi): \u201cBringing up other things and using them\nto clarify it\u201d\n\nParallelizing (mou): \u201cComparing expressions and jointly\nproceeding\u201d\n\nPulling (yuan): \u201cSaying, \u2018You are so. How is it\nthat I alone cannot be so?\u2019\u201d\n\nPushing (tui): \u201cOn the grounds that what they\ndon\u2019t accept is the same as what they do accept, propose\nit\u201d.\n\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy surrounding how these techniques\nare to be understood and what their relationship is. It has been\nargued that they comprise the steps of a single, complex inference\nprocedure in which a claim is established. However, this view is\ndifficult to justify because it requires supporting the claim that\neach step is somehow necessary, serving as an essential premise for\nthe next. An easier and more commonly accepted view is that each\ntechnique may operate independently to establish a point. Yang (2020)\nargues that each serves to make an inference in its own right: the\nfirst two are used to infer in each case that a proposition is true,\nwhile the second two are used to infer in each case that a proposition\nis false. By contrast, Robins (2010) argues that each is an instance\nof the general method of reasoning by analogy that was common\nthroughout most of early Chinese thought. The Mohists are clarifying\nfour different ways in which this general method might be\ninstantiated. The first two cover the domains of reference and\nmeaning, as distinguished above. Analogy (pi) indicates the\nmethod of extending kinds, employing models of comparison in\nperception or thought by acts of reference to identify or explain what\nsomething is. Parallelizing (mou) is the Mohist extension of\nthis idea into the world of linguistic forms. \u201cPushing\u201d\nand \u201cpulling\u201d hint at the pragmatic circumstances in\ndisputation in which one attempts to establish a claim on the basis of\nits analogy with claims the other side has already accepted.\n\nHere we concentrate on the technique of parallelizing, arguably the\nMohists\u2019 most original contribution to early Chinese thought on\ndisputation and logic. (For further discussion, see Yang 2020, Robins\n2010 and 2012, and the entry\n Mohist Canons.)\n As their explanation suggests (\u201ccomparing expressions and\njointly proceeding\u201d, bi ci er ju xing), the Mohists\ntreat parallelizing as a technique in which linguistic models of a\ncertain grammatical form are utilized to make a comparative point\nabout some other linguistic construction that is in doubt. For\ninstance, the following statements have similar grammatical form:\n\n\nWhite horses are horses; riding white horses is riding horses.\n\nBlack horses are horses; riding black horses is riding horses.\n\nJack is a person; loving Jack is loving a person.\n\nJill is a person; loving Jill is loving a person.\n\n\nEach is a model that instantiates a common linguistic form. The\nMohists do not give a symbolic representation of this form, but we can\nassume its recognition as a general kind in virtue of the parallelism\nin structure that the models collectively exhibit. Technically, each\nstatement is a conjunction of two simpler statements (with no obvious\nconditional relationship indicated, which is sometimes assumed). So\nthe general form seems to be:\n\n(Form A)\n(A is B) & (VA is\nVB),\n\n\nwhere V is a verb combined with the noun phrases A\nand B to yield, in effect, two distinct nominalized\ninfinitives. We call this \u201cForm A\u201d to represent a general\nkind, a kind of linguistic form commonly recognized in its instances.\nOn the other hand, they are aware that instances of this form may fail\nas well. For example:\n\n\nRobbers are people, [but] being without robbers is not being without\npeople.\n\nRobbers are people, [but] desiring to be without robbers is not\ndesiring to be without people.\n\n\nThe Mohists put these latter examples in a different class, which we\nmay identify as:\n\n(Form B)\n(A is B) & (VA is not\nVB)\n\n\nThe Mohist technique of parallelizing seeks to establish some other\nclaim that might be doubted on the basis of its analogy with the\nproposed models. Consider the following statement constructed from the\nnominals \u201cboat\u201d and \u201cwood\u201d, and the verb\n\u201center\u201d:\n\nA boat is wood, [but] entering a boat is not entering wood.\n\nThe Mohists treat this statement as admissible, thus classifying it\nunder the general kind associated with\n Form B.\n This is \u201ccomparing expressions and jointly proceeding\u201d,\nbut the Mohists\u2019 increasing sensitivity to semantic nuances led\nthem to admonish caution about drawing inferences merely on the basis\nof form. Some inferences \u201cproceed\u201d, others don\u2019t,\nregardless of obvious parallelisms. As a result, they appropriated\nindividual cases in one way or another depending on how the semantics\nof their terms played out in combination. On the other hand, this\ncareful attention to individual cases led them to a discovery of\nintensional contexts, arguably the most original contribution of the\nMohists\u2019 studies of language.\n3.5 Investigations of Intensionality\n\nThe later Mohists may well have been the first in the world to attempt\nto furnish a systematic philosophical treatment of intensionality. An\nabundance of evidence suggests that they were aware of both the\npervasiveness of intensional phenomena in natural language and the way\nin which these phenomena tend to frustrate the view that natural\nlanguage meaning is essentially compositional in structure (Willman\n2010). They were probably also aware not only of the distinction\nbetween intensions and extensions, but also of the way in which this\ndistinction may be essential to the determination of the truth or\nadmissibility of sentences involving intensional contexts. Moreover,\nthey do not seem to have made any attempt to explain away these\ncontexts in terms of basic semantic principles, by denying that they\nexist, or by asserting that they can be reduced to, or explained in\nterms of, other more philosophically admissible modes of expression.\nOn the contrary, they not only embraced intensionality as a\nfundamental feature of language, but also attempted to exploit it for\nthe purpose of advancing their philosophical views, particularly their\nviews on ethics.\n\nTo be sure, the Mohists did not attempt to develop any rigorous\nnotation for handling differences of logical form. But as noted in\nexamples above, they were wary of assuming that sentences or\nexpressions with the same grammatical form have analogous semantical\nrepresentations. It is quite possibly from observations like these\nthat the later Mohists were led to compare the satisfaction conditions\nof expressions obtained from the intersubstitution of co-referential\nterms and co-extensive predicates. They did so by utilizing what we\nwould now identify as tests for intensionality. Many of these tests\ninvolved typical epistemic verbs, like \u201cknow\u201d,\n\u201cthink of\u201d, and \u201clove\u201d. For instance, in B40\nof the Canons the Mohists claim that:\n\nTo assert the identity of knowing dogs and knowing canines is a\nmistake; to not do so is not a mistake.\n\nThis translation is but one of many that have variously interpreted\nthe original text, and some scholars have claimed that the original is\nin need of textual emendation due to copyist errors in centuries past\n(e.g., He 1971 and Chen 1983; see also Zong 2000). However, it does\nmake sense when we recognize that the Mohists spent a great deal of\neffort thinking about how the meanings of simple names vary in\ncombination with others. According to A.C. Graham, the names\ngou (dog) and quan (canine) were the Mohists\u2019\nstock examples of terms that refer to the same thing, but which have\nslightly different senses, probably due to their individual\netymologies. Contemporary philosophers of language might consider that\nthe Mohists were on the verge of developing an ontology of mental\nstates with these examples, thinking of the opacity of the context\n\u201cknowing\u201d as a consequence of potential failures of\nknowledge. Jack might know what a dog is, but he might not know what a\ncanine is, regardless of the co-extension of \u201cdog\u201d and\n\u201ccanine\u201d. But the Mohists were not likely thinking of\nlanguage in any way as a window to the mind. There is no indication\nanywhere in Mohist literature suggesting that they were interested in\ndeveloping a classification of mental states. Indeed, the Mohists\nweighed the consequences of comparing linguistic expressions involving\nnot only those intensional verbs we usually associate with mental\nstates, such as \u201cknow\u201d, \u201cthink of\u201d,\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201clove\u201d and the like, but also\napparently intensional contexts introduced by verbs having nothing\nobviously to do with the mind, and they provide no indications that\nthey thought about distinguishing them.\n\nIn the Xiao Qu, for example, the Mohists give an intensional\nanalysis of linguistic contexts involving the expressions\n\u201criding\u201d (cheng), \u201centering\u201d\n(ru), \u201cabounding in\u201d (duo), \u201cbeing\nwithout\u201d (wu), \u201cserve\u201d (shi), and\neven \u201ckilling\u201d (sha). Their interest seems to\nhave been primarily semantical, with the issue of compositionality at\nthe forefront of their inquiries. They were concerned with whether or\nnot ideographs in combination produced meaningful wholes that are\nproperly analyzed as the sums of their constituent parts. Those not\nanalyzable in this way were likely deemed idiomatic. Consider again\nthe curious use of the phrase \u201centering wood\u201d (ru\nmu) in the following line from NO15:\n\nA boat is wood, but entering a boat is not entering wood.\n\nThe verb \u201centering\u201d (ru) would not normally be\nconsidered to indicate an intensional context. Zhang and Liu (2007)\nanalyze the complex expression ru mu (entering wood) as\n\u201cgoing to die\u201d, a meaning obviously surpassing the\nconnotation of ru chuan (entering a boat), in this case\nsignifying only the simple action of going into a boat. On the other\nhand, each of these expressions is identical in grammatical form, a\nfact again leading the Mohists to the conclusion that grammatical form\ncan be deceptive and that any expression may be either an analyzable\ncompound or an undifferentiable semantic whole.\n\nIt might be noted that the terms \u201cboat\u201d and\n\u201cwood\u201d are not co-extensive, and hence cannot be\ninterchanged to test whether or not the context in which they occur is\nintensional. Yet while it is true that the Mohists recognized names of\ndifferent scope (lei categorizes names that classify many\nthings while si categorizes those that refer to just one),\nthey were clearly not confined to conceiving expressions of the form\n\u201cX is Y\u201d as assertions of predication.\nAs noted above, their concept of \u201csameness\u201d\n(tong) was inclusive enough to accommodate a reading that in\nno way presupposes a failure of extension. For instance, a boat is\nwood in the sense that it is made up of wood, where \u201cwood\u201d\nis conceived not as a general kind, but as the very stuff of which the\nboat in question is made. This is likely what the Mohists had in mind\nwith this example because the point they are making clearly turns on a\ncomparison of the meanings of linguistic complexes\n(\u201centering a boat\u201d and \u201centering wood\u201d) and\nhow the meanings of words change in virtue of the contexts in which\nthey occur.\n\nMoreover, intensionality is marked by tests other than the\nintersubstitution of co-referential terms, co-extensive predicates, or\nlogically equivalent sentences. A context may be deemed intensional if\nit contains a phrase with a quantifier that allows for an\n\u201cunspecific\u201d reading (see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n For example, it may be true that Oedipus is seeking a member of his\nfamily, but not true that he is seeking Jocasta, in spite of the fact\nthat Jocasta is a member of his family. For, there might be no family\nmember in particular whom Oedipus is seeking. Something like\nthis seems to be the point the Mohists are making with the following\nexample:\n\nHer younger brother is a handsome man, but loving her younger brother\nis not loving a handsome man.\n\nThe sparsity of grammatical marks for quantification in Classical\nChinese does not require us to read the expression mei ren\n(\u201ca handsome man\u201d) in terms of the existentially\nquantified phrase \u201csome x such that x is male\nand handsome\u201d. But this only makes the Mohists\u2019 point more\nglaring. If \u201cloving a handsome man\u201d (ai mei ren)\nmay be taken to involve romantic attraction, and not just the kind of\nfilial love that exists between family members, then we can see why\nthe Mohists would consider this a failure of inference.\n\nSimilar points are made with regard to the remaining non-epistemic\nintensional transitive verbs. For example:\n\nThe father of huo is a human; and yet it does not follow from\nthis that when huo serves his father, he is serving a\nhuman.\n\nEvidence that the transitive verb shi (serve) is intensional\ncomes from the expression \u201cserving a human\u201d, which was\nunderstood in terms of the behavior of a service worker, somebody who\nacts as a servant. Quite obviously this has nothing to do with states\nof mind (such as those involving failures of knowledge).\n\nOn the other hand, we feel rightly confused when the Mohists say:\n\nRobbers are people \u2026 but killing robbers is not killing\npeople.\n\nThe term \u201ckilling\u201d is ordinarily thought of as an\nextensional verb. It is a matter of some controversy, but the Mohists\napparently felt that the combination of the ideographs sha\n(killing) and dao ren (robbers) formed an idiom that was\nrecognized as a distinct, unanalyzable unit of common speech, carrying\nwith it connotations of justified execution. This was not discerned in\nthe semantics of \u201ckilling people\u201d, which probably more\nsimply indicated an act of murder. Indeed, the Mohists explicitly\nprohibited the latter in connection with their espoused doctrine of\nuniversal love (cf. NO17 from Graham\u2019s translation\n(2003 [1978])). Not unlike many Western philosophers, the Mohists seem\nto have felt that careful attention to semantical nuances can have an\nimportant bearing on moral issues.\n\nThat is to say, part of the Mohists\u2019 interest in the analysis of\nlanguage stems from a firm conviction that the semantical distinctions\nuncovered by careful analysis can help put to rest certain questions\nabout the legitimacy of their basic moral beliefs. The Mohists\ninsisted that proper conduct involves \u201cloving all people without\nexception\u201d (which implies opposing acts of murder), but they\nwere also not opposed to the \u201cjustified execution\u201d of\nthose found guilty of serious crime. When questioned on grounds of\ninconsistency, they replied by pointing out that the endorsement of\njustified execution is not an inhumane act that compromises their\nstance on the value of loving all people. This might not have\nconvinced many of their interlocutors that their doctrine of universal\nlove is justified, but it would have put to rest the charge that they\nwere being illogical, and in any case consistency would surely have\nbeen conceived as a mark of superiority over any of the views of their\nopponents incapable of withstanding comparable scrutiny.\n4. Daoist Replies and Critique of Logic\n\nWhile the kinds of semantic rules underlying the interpretation of our\nexpressions in language might be heterogeneous, with no guarantee that\nassumptions about compositionality will hold, the Mohists nevertheless\ndid not waver in their belief that the objects of experience exhibit\nreal similarities and differences, and that the identification of\nthese similarities and differences is what allows us to\n\u201cdistinguish the noble and the base\u201d (ming gui\njian, to use Xunzi\u2019s phrase). Indeed, the central purpose\nof language is to guide behavior by clarifying how one should act, and\nthis is done by distinguishing the noble and the base through the\nsubtle analysis of similarities and differences. We take the actions\nof exemplary individuals as models, identify the criteria that\ndistinguish them or their actions, and act accordingly in an analogous\nway. Sometimes these semantic analyses would reveal odd consequences;\nas noted above, \u201crobbers are people, but killing robbers is not\nkilling people\u201d. But the Mohists were not in general averse to\nembracing such oddities, given their general conviction that the\nphilosophical explication of meaning should follow normal conventions\nof use. In any case, they never abandoned the belief that an\nexhaustive analysis of semantic possibilities should render\ntransparent real similarities and differences in the world in a way\nthat provides a consistent, invariable guide for action. If the\nanalysis of language can provide this, then confusion about how to act\nshould be dispelled from society and people should be able to live\ntogether in harmony.\n\nThis claim that the analysis of language can provide a consistent\nguide for action is precisely what the Daoists targeted in their\nobjections and the main focus of their philosophical skepticism. What\nis surprising is that Daoist skeptics like Zhuangzi do not reject the\nMohists\u2019 basic view that the world is populated by various kinds\nof objects with real similarities and differences. They agree,\nmoreover, in their basic understanding of how objects undergo\ndifferent forms of transformation in time; the Mohists even give us\ndistinct terms to convey these differences. The difference is that, in\nZhuangzi\u2019s view, no matter how much analysis we undertake, or\nhow finely we discriminate, our language will never secure enough\ntraction in reality to provide us with a constant guide for action.\nZhuangzi was so unsatisfied with the ongoing debates of his times that\nhe was compelled to develop what he took to be a transcendent\nphilosophical worldview not limited by the hope of resolving these\ndebates through simple explications of semantic distinctions. Life is\nlarger than what can be grasped by the human capacity for reason, and\nthere are forms of intuitive knowledge or experience that cannot be\nexplained by the crude implements of language.\n\nThere are stories in the Zhuangzi that attest to the\nperfected skills of wheelwrights, carpenters, and other artisans who\nlament the fact that they cannot express how they manage to perform\ntheir tasks so well. The self-description of wheelwright Pian is a\ngood example:\n\n\nI look at it from the point of view of my own work. When I chisel a\nwheel, if the blows of the mallet are too gentle, the chisel slides\nand won\u2019t take hold. But if they\u2019re too hard, it bites in\nand won\u2019t budge. Not too gentle, not too hard\u2014you can get\nit in your hand and feel it in your mind. You can\u2019t put it into\nwords, and yet there is a knack to it somehow. I can\u2019t teach it\nto my son and he can\u2019t learn it from me. So I\u2019ve gone\nalong for seventy years and at my age I am still chiseling wheels.\nWhen the men of old died they took with them the things that\ncouldn\u2019t be handed down. So what you are reading there must be\nnothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old. (tr. Watson 1968:\n152\u20133)\n\n\nThe reference to books at the end of this passage is striking.\nZhuangzi claims to have an insight about the subtlety and facility of\nunderstanding that cannot be captured in written form, or even through\noral discourse with appropriate demonstratives. The names of language\ndiscriminate meanings, but inevitably there is slippage in their\ncoordination with objects.\n\nThis is most obviously apparent in Zhuangzi\u2019s appeal to the\nindexical phenomena of language, which Zhuangzi used as a foil against\nthe Mohists\u2019 claim that the meanings of terms can reliably fix\ntheir designations. He seems to have in mind what we would understand\nby the term \u201cindexical\u201d today: a term whose designation is\nfixed not only by its meaning but also by facts about the conditions\nsurrounding its utterance. Such facts are relevant to the\ndetermination of the shifting referents of pronouns (\u201cI\u201d,\n\u201cyou\u201d), demonstratives (\u201cthis\u201d,\n\u201cthat\u201d), and spatial and temporal adverbs\n(\u201chere\u201d, \u201cthere\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d,\n\u201cnow\u201d, \u201cbefore\u201d), and Zhuangzi appeals to all\nof these in a variety of elliptical and argumentative contexts. His\ngeneral view seems to be that different perspectives or standpoints\ninvolved in the utterances of terms have important bearings on how\nthese terms are used and what they refer to. The so-called impure\nindexicals \u201cthis\u201d (bi) and \u201cthat\u201d\n(shi) (see the entry on\n indexicals),\n commonly used in Classical Chinese for naming objects (\u201cThis is\na horse\u201d, \u201cThat is an ox\u201d), make the perspectivalism\nof Zhuangzi\u2019s approach clear:\n\n\nNo thing is not that; no thing is not this. From that, it is not seen;\nfrom this it is known. Therefore it is said: That comes out of this;\nthis goes along with that; which is to say, that and this are born\nsimultaneously. (Zhuangzi 2/27\u201329; tr. Graham 1989)\n\n\nArguably, Zhuangzi is suggesting that reference is always keyed to a\nperspective that somehow rules out others. This would explain the\nconclusion that \u201cthat and this are born simultaneously\u201d:\nthe perspective one takes in calling an object \u201cthis\u201d\nimplies an alternative perspective in which another calls it\n\u201cthat\u201d. \u201cThat\u201d and \u201cthis\u201d is a\npair whose terms function in coordination. Zhuangzi is seeking a\nphilosophical perspective that transcends all arbitrary\ndichotomies:\n\n\nThis too is that, that too is this. There they say \u201cIt\u2019s\nthis, it\u2019s not\u201d from one point of view, here we say\n\u201cIt\u2019s this, it\u2019s not\u201d from another point of\nview. Are there really this and that? Or really no this and that?\nWhere neither this nor that finds its opposite is called the axis of\nthe Way. When once the axis is found at the center of the circle there\nis no limit to responding with either, on the one hand no limit to\nwhat is this, on the other no limit to what is not. Therefore I say,\n\u201cThe best means is illumination\u201d. (Zhuangzi\n2/29\u201331; tr. Graham 1989)\n\n\nThis point is made with demonstratives, which are among the most\nfickle of the indexicals of language, seemingly capable of referring\nto anything regardless of context. But we can appreciate the\ngeneralization Zhuangzi is hinting at when we consider again how the\nMohists explained acts of reference. Recall that when the Mohists say\n\u201cThere is a horse\u201d (you ma), they appear to be\nmaking a claim to the effect that a certain object x\nresembles the model m for horses. If they state this with the\ndemonstrative bi (\u201cthis\u201d), then they are making\nthe further claim that some object x to which they stand in a\ncertain relation (likely of perceptual acquaintance) resembles the\nmodel m for horses. Note also that the Mohists recognize that\nobjects do not always resemble their standards exactly; sometimes it\nis only partial, in which case the object of reference must resemble\nit \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d, according to a criterion\n(yi). Presumably, this criterion identifies something salient\nin the comparison that remains consistent across linguistic contexts.\nZhuangzi\u2019s point would then amount to the claim that no salience\nconditions are ever invariable across linguistic contexts. The\nuniqueness of each act of reference undermines the possibility of\nidentifying any contextually invariant rule, since the conditions of\nsuccessful reference involve facts not only about the relations of\nnames and objects but also about the relations of acquaintance one has\nwith those objects. Indeed, given the great emphasis on indexicality\nin the Zhuangzi, some scholars have claimed that Zhuangzi\nholds the thesis that all language is indexical. This is a view that\ncannot be defended here; readers may consult Hansen 1992 for a lengthy\ntreatment.\n5. Xunzi\u2019s Confucian Appropriation of Mohist Logic\n\nSignificantly more so than other major philosophers of the Warring\nStates Period, the Mohists believed that proper ethical conduct, and\nthe uses of language essential to its realization, could be determined\nby the ability of the common citizen to distinguish, independently of\ngovernment authority and by rational means, real similarities and\ndifferences in the nuances of ethical action. Zhuangzi\u2019s\nskeptical arguments called much of this belief into question, but left\nlittle in its place to placate the demands of effective governance and\norderly rule. The Confucian philosopher Xunzi of the late Warring\nStates Period sought to reestablish ethics on positive, constructive\nfoundations, but without succumbing to the frustrating Daoist\nrejoinders that put so much of Mohism in doubt.\n\nOn the surface, Xunzi\u2019s theories of logic and language resemble\nthose of the Mohists, and he makes great use of the doctrines of the\nMohist Canons to develop his own arguments. But underneath we\nfind Confucian presuppositions that diverge radically from the Mohist\nparadigm. Zhuangzi seized on indexicality to make the case that names\ncannot be used invariably across linguistic contexts. Reacting to the\nproblematic task of identifying impeccable salience conditions in\nperception or thought to determine how a name is to be used, Xunzi put\nZhuangzi\u2019s arguments to use to make the case that the\ncorrectness conditions of language, if there are to be any at all,\nmust be determined by convention. Since these conventions are\nultimately arbitrary, they cannot be established by the Mohists\u2019\nmethods of discourse or argumentation. They have to be determined by\nauthority, the rule of sage-kings who institute the conventions of\nlanguage as they deem fit through the promotion of proper social\nconduct and the suppression of deviant behavior.\n\nXunzi thus reasserted the Confucian tradition of imposing order onto\nsociety through uncompromising but benevolent rule to ensure that the\nanarchy of moral discourse that abounds in its absence does not\nculminate in the deterioration of civil society. He held these views\nnot merely because they offered a pragmatic solution to\nZhuangzi\u2019s radical skepticism, but also because they were\nconsistent with his cynical view of human nature. Our nature is\ninherently corruptible and bad, incapable of sustaining civil order if\nleft to itself, and therefore demands correction by the institutions\nof society. More generally, and quite against the convictions of his\nDaoist counterparts, Xunzi held that morality is an invention to\ncontrol man\u2019s nature, because nature itself, in its endless\ntransformations and unpredictable spontaneity, cannot be relied on to\nconstrain human passion sufficiently to maintain the requisites of\nsocial harmony.\n\nIn practice, Xunzi\u2019s philosophical method follows much the same\ncourse as the Mohists\u2019. He takes it upon himself to analyze the\n\u201cpurpose of having names\u201d, the \u201cevidence for\nassimilating and differentiating\u201d, and the \u201cbasic\nrequirements for instituting names\u201d (Xunzi, Book 22).\nHowever, for Xunzi, reason must stop short of justifying what actions\nmay serve as models for ethical conduct. The Mohists held that an\naction is admissible if it accords with general considerations of\nutility. This makes the justification of the action contingent on the\ncircumstances surrounding the action\u2019s consequences, whether\nthey lead to the enrichment of society, and whether they contribute to\nthe realization of the principle of universal love. Determining\nwhether the action is justified thus prescribes the use of reason\nindependently of judgments of authority. In Xunzi\u2019s view, this\nappeal to utility implies a use of reason that his own ethics would\nforbid, because the actions of a sage are not to be justified by\nanything independently of their intrinsic moral authority. Since the\ncustoms instituted by the sage are essentially stipulated as models of\nappropriate conduct, reason plays no role in their identification as\nsuch to the common individual.\n\nNotably, the hypostasization of the notion of a model of ethical\nconduct (fa) in early Chinese thought is largely a\ncontribution of the Mohists, who used it liberally in place of the\nConfucian appeal to the authority of tradition. But Xunzi found little\nuse for it except in reference to the very Confucian customs the\nMohists attempted to supplant. Indeed, the reason of the common\nindividual is out of place here because the ability to correctly\nidentify these models is a talent requiring years of cultivation and\nmastery, which only the intellectual elites of society would be\nexpected to attain. Proper conduct must be transmitted through\neducation from these elites, ultimately from those in high office who\nhave the benefit of a life of education in proper governance.\n\nSuch presuppositions have important ramifications in Xunzi\u2019s\ntheories of naming and reference. Acts of naming are decided not by\nreason, but by convention, and Xunzi attributes the authority to\nestablish these conventions to the sage-kings of later antiquity:\n\n\nAs for the names established by the later kings, for names of\npunishments follow the Shang dynasty, for names of titles the Chou,\nfor cultural names the ceremonies\u2026 (Xunzi, Book\n22)\n\n\nCommon people are prohibited from questioning the mandates of\nlinguistic conventions:\n\n\nHence hair-splitting wordings and invention of names on your own\nauthority, to disorder correct names and put people in doubt and\nconfusion, multiplying argument and litigation between persons, are to\nbe pronounced the worst of subversions, to be condemned like the crime\nof falsifying tallies and measures. (Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nXunzi avoids one of his own subversions by restricting his task to\nfiguring out how the conventions established by authority can serve as\nexamples for the common citizen, and this requires (much as the\nMohists thought) identifying the conditions by which one extends the\nnames so designated to other objects or actions that are appropriately\nsimilar to them.\n\nIt is in this matter that our common reason plays its critical role,\nwhich Xunzi understands in terms of our capacity to use the evidence\nof perception to make appropriate discriminations. For example, one\nsees two shapes, one triangular, the other square. Nothing in this\ndifferentiation of patterns forces one to attribute the name\n\u201ctriangular\u201d to the first and \u201csquare\u201d to the\nsecond. A single name could just as well be used for all three and\nfour sided polygons. However, the senses have the effect of\nencouraging a distinct name for each; they are \u201cevidence\u201d\n(yuan, causes, means) for assimilating and differentiating\nobjects in language. For instance, one may regard the assertion\n\u201cMountains and abysses are level\u201d as inadmissible (or\nfalse), because it is contradicted by our perception of the non-level\nrelation of the two geographical objects. This is the case, for Xunzi,\neven though it is convention, in the final analysis, that determines\nhow the terms \u201cmountain\u201d and \u201cabyss\u201d are to be\nused. Xunzi\u2019s point is not that the analysis of meanings somehow\nfixes how the terms of language are to be used, but that when\nconvention does \u201cfix ahead\u201d (qi) the meanings of\nthese terms, one is to use the senses to determine whether the objects\nto which they refer are to be treated as the same or different.\n\nXunzi\u2019s insistence that convention is at the bottom of all acts\nof naming gave him the liberty to favor simple, commonsense solutions\nto semantic puzzles that aroused such contention among the disputants\nof other schools. Recall that the Mohists argued that while robbers\nare people, it does not follow that \u201ckilling robbers is killing\npeople\u201d. Their aim, apparently, was to reconcile their\nutilitarian ethics with their doctrine of universal love. They\nregarded \u201cloving all people\u201d as compatible with the\njustified execution of criminals on the supposition that the phrase\n\u201ckilling robbers\u201d (justified execution) was not\n\u201ckilling people\u201d (murder), and hence not inconsistent with\ntheir ethics of \u201cloving (all) people\u201d. Xunzi, whose\nConfucian ethics were not challenged by this apparent inconsistency,\nremained unpersuaded by the Mohists\u2019 odd appeal to the idiom. In\nhis view, the assertion \u201cKilling robbers is killing\npeople\u201d is analyzed compositionally in the same way as\n\u201cRiding white horses is riding horses\u201d, making it likewise\nadmissible.\n\nIn rejecting the Mohists\u2019 judgment on this point, Xunzi is not\ncontesting the Mohists\u2019 general theory of inference. He is only\ndisputing its application in this case. While there is no evidence\nthat Xunzi held that all complex meaning is strictly compositional, he\nwas disinclined to take seriously the kinds of exceptions that the\nMohists garnered for their ethical views. His preference seems to have\nbeen for a simpler theory that accommodates terms of whatever levels\nof generality are necessary for purposes of communicative clarity. The\ncomplex \u201ckilling people\u201d is better analyzed\ncompositionally if another simple term of appropriate generality\n(e.g., \u201cmurder\u201d) is at hand to avoid the confusion:\n\n\nIf a single name is enough to communicate, make it single; if not,\ncombine. (Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, single terms are more general than the complexes\nin which they occur:\n\n\nIf the single is nowhere in conflict with the combined, it is the more\ngeneral; but general though it is, there is no harm in it.\n(Xunzi, Book 22)\n\n\nNo harm, that is, in terms of whatever levels of generality are\nnecessary for communicative clarity (e.g., \u201cbird\u201d,\n\u201canimal\u201d), up to the broadest level of generality\n(\u201cthing\u201d). Like the Mohists, Xunzi\u2019s theory of\ninference is based on the notion that a model must serve as a standard\nof resemblance: naming an object is like \u201cmeasuring an unknown\nlength by a footrule\u201d. He was therefore inclined to draw\ninferences in much the same way. The assertion \u201cx is an\nanimal\u201d is a valid inference from the claim \u201cx\nresembles the model m for animal\u201d on the assumption\nthat anything resembling m is an animal.\n\nSimilarly, \u201cA white horse is a horse\u201d is a valid\ninference, in Xunzi\u2019s view, from the claim:\n\nThe model \\(m_1\\) for \u201cwhite horse\u201d resembles the model\n\\(m_2\\) for \u201chorse\u201d.\n\nXunzi\u2019s reference to this example in particular in Book 22 of\nthe Xunzi is likely his response to the paradoxical statement\n\u201cWhite horses are not horses\u201d, famously asserted by the\nsophist Gongsun Long probably as a foil to the Mohists\u2019 theories\nof naming and reference (Gongsun Long may himself have once been a\nMohist; see the entry\n School of Names\n for further discussion). The inference works, presumably, because\n\\(m_2\\) serves as a model for \u201chorse\u201d irrespective of its\ncolor. Since color is not a relevant criterion of resemblance,\n\u201chorse\u201d functions as a term of greater generality.\n\nIn all of this, there is no disagreement with Mohist views. The\ndisagreement arises in the analysis of particulars, which the Mohists\nfelt could substantively determine the outcomes of ethical disputes.\nGiven that convention lies at the bottom of all acts of naming, Xunzi\nabandons any supposition that semantics (or even reason, narrowly\nconstrued in the Mohists\u2019 sense of disputation) can be the\nground of ethics. On the other hand, Xunzi\u2019s deference to\nauthority leaves one to wonder what principles of reason an educated\nelite would use in determining why a given set of conventions in\nlanguage are more appropriate than others. It can be assumed that\ntheir choices would not be completely arbitrary, but that they would\nbe guided by the very faculties of discrimination in perception that\nthe Mohists argued were at the foundations of our common reason.\nIndeed, much in spite of the admirable clarity with which he\narticulated his views on the role of language in ethical conduct,\nXunzi leaves the reader with an unresolved tension between what he had\nhoped to accomplish in his own philosophical analyses and the mandates\nof those higher officials to whose authority he admonishes us to yield\n(see the entry\n Xunzi\n for further details).\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nAmong Chinese philosophical schools of the pre-Han era, it is the\nlater Mohists who deserve the greatest credit for pioneering and\nsystematizing the studies of language and logic. In the context of a\ngeneral theoretical framework based on precisely formulated\ndefinitions, they developed a workable theory of analogical inference\nthat was sensitive to the idiosyncratic semantic contributions of\nterms in combination. Awareness of the limitations of compositionality\nprobably led them away from the development of a theory of logical\nforms, but it stimulated insights about intensional phenomena in\nlanguage that prompted more sophisticated defenses of their ethical\nviews, and encouraged a broad understanding of how language functions\nin communicative discourse that warrants ongoing consideration today.\nXunzi may have reached a new height in the rigor and clarity with\nwhich he presented his logical and linguistic views, but he did not\nsurpass his Mohist forebears in originality, seeking primarily to\nutilize their insights in support of a largely Confucian ethical\nagenda. While the Mohists were clearly aware of many of the\nlimitations of their own methods of reasoning, they nevertheless\nretained the hope that a sophisticated analysis of language would\nreveal real similarities and differences in experience that would\nreliably guide ethical action. It is this general hope that was the\nfocus of Daoist critics like Zhuangzi, who argued from radically\nperspectivalist assumptions that no language, however refined, is\nadequate to the task of providing consistent normative standards.\nWhether or not this claim is true is still a matter of debate, with\nscholars of Chinese philosophy today leaning one way or another on\nancient conceptions of the roles of language and logic in human\nthought and action.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Additional Sources", "General Surveys of Classical Chinese Thought"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ames, Roger T. and Henry Rosemont Jr. (trans), 1998, <em>The\nAnalects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation</em> (complete\ntranslation), New York: Ballantine Books.", "Graham, A.C., 2003 [1978], <em>Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and\nScience</em>, reprint edition, Hong Kong: Chinese University Press;\noriginal edition, 1978.", "Johnston, Ian (trans.), 2010, <em>The Mozi: A Complete\nTranslation</em>, New York: Columbia University Press.", "Mei, Yi-pao (trans.), 1929, <em>The Ethical and Political Works of\nMotse</em> (partial translation), London: Probsthain.", "Watson, Burton (trans.), 1963, <em>Mo Tzu: Basic Writings</em>\n(partial translation), New York: Columbia University Press.", "Hutton, E.L.
