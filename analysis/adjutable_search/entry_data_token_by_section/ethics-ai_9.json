    "main_text": "Main Debates || Automation and Employment\n2.6 Automation and Employment\n\nIt seems clear that AI and robotics will lead to significant gains in\nproductivity and thus overall wealth. The attempt to increase\nproductivity has often been a feature of the economy, though the\nemphasis on \u201cgrowth\u201d is a modern phenomenon (Harari 2016:\n240). However, productivity gains through automation typically mean\nthat fewer humans are required for the same output. This does not\nnecessarily imply a loss of overall employment, however, because\navailable wealth increases and that can increase demand sufficiently\nto counteract the productivity gain. In the long run, higher\nproductivity in industrial societies has led to more wealth overall.\nMajor labour market disruptions have occurred in the past, e.g.,\nfarming employed over 60% of the workforce in Europe and North-America\nin 1800, while by 2010 it employed ca. 5% in the EU, and even less in\nthe wealthiest countries (European Commission 2013). In the 20 years\nbetween 1950 and 1970 the number of hired agricultural workers in the\nUK was reduced by 50% (Zayed and Loft 2019). Some of these disruptions\nlead to more labour-intensive industries moving to places with lower\nlabour cost. This is an ongoing process.\n\nClassic automation replaced human muscle, whereas digital automation\nreplaces human thought or information-processing\u2014and unlike\nphysical machines, digital automation is very cheap to duplicate\n(Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2014). It may thus mean a more radical change\non the labour market. So, the main question is: will the effects be\ndifferent this time? Will the creation of new jobs and wealth keep up\nwith the destruction of jobs? And even if it is not\ndifferent, what are the transition costs, and who bears them? Do we\nneed to make societal adjustments for a fair distribution of costs and\nbenefits of digital automation?\n\nResponses to the issue of unemployment from AI have ranged from the\nalarmed (Frey and Osborne 2013; Westlake 2014) to the neutral\n(Metcalf, Keller, and Boyd 2016 [OIR]; Calo 2018; Frey 2019) to the\noptimistic (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2016; Harari 2016; Danaher 2019a).\nIn principle, the labour market effect of automation seems to be\nfairly well understood as involving two channels:\n\n\n(i) the nature of interactions between differently skilled workers and\nnew technologies affecting labour demand and (ii) the equilibrium\neffects of technological progress through consequent changes in labour\nsupply and product markets. (Goos 2018: 362)\n\n\nWhat currently seems to happen in the labour market as a result of AI\nand robotics automation is \u201cjob polarisation\u201d or the\n\u201cdumbbell\u201d shape (Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009): The\nhighly skilled technical jobs are in demand and highly paid, the low\nskilled service jobs are in demand and badly paid, but the\nmid-qualification jobs in factories and offices, i.e., the majority of\njobs, are under pressure and reduced because they are relatively\npredictable, and most likely to be automated (Baldwin 2019).\n\nPerhaps enormous productivity gains will allow the \u201cage of\nleisure\u201d to be realised, something (Keynes 1930) had predicted\nto occur around 2030, assuming a growth rate of 1% per annum.\nActually, we have already reached the level he anticipated for 2030,\nbut we are still working\u2014consuming more and inventing ever more\nlevels of organisation. Harari explains how this economic development\nallowed humanity to overcome hunger, disease, and war\u2014and now we\naim for immortality and eternal bliss through AI, thus his title\nHomo Deus (Harari 2016: 75).\n\nIn general terms, the issue of unemployment is an issue of how goods\nin a society should be justly distributed. A standard view is that\ndistributive justice should be rationally decided from behind a\n\u201cveil of ignorance\u201d (Rawls 1971), i.e., as if one does not\nknow what position in a society one would actually be taking (labourer\nor industrialist, etc.). Rawls thought the chosen principles would\nthen support basic liberties and a distribution that is of greatest\nbenefit to the least-advantaged members of society. It would appear\nthat the AI economy has three features that make such justice\nunlikely: First, it operates in a largely unregulated environment\nwhere responsibility is often hard to allocate. Second, it operates in\nmarkets that have a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d feature where\nmonopolies develop quickly. Third, the \u201cnew economy\u201d of\nthe digital service industries is based on intangible assets, also\ncalled \u201ccapitalism without capital\u201d (Haskel and Westlake\n2017). This means that it is difficult to control multinational\ndigital corporations that do not rely on a physical plant in a\nparticular location. These three features seem to suggest that if we\nleave the distribution of wealth to free market forces, the result\nwould be a heavily unjust distribution: And this is indeed a\ndevelopment that we can already see.\n\nOne interesting question that has not received too much attention is\nwhether the development of AI is environmentally sustainable: Like all\ncomputing systems, AI systems produce waste that is very hard to\nrecycle and they consume vast amounts of energy, especially for the\ntraining of machine learning systems (and even for the\n\u201cmining\u201d of cryptocurrency). Again, it appears that some\nactors in this space offload such costs to the general society.\n",
