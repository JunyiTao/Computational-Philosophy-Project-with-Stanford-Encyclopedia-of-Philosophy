In other words, they were hostesses,\nwhose job was to make sure that the men who came to share important\nphilosophical insight in their home did not go about with an empty\nglass. Famous saloni\u00e8res of the French Revolution include\nMadame Helvetius, widow of the philosopher of that name, Madame de\nStael, Madame Roland, wife of the Girondin minister of the interior,\nand Sophie de Grouchy. Although these women were hostesses, their\nmotivation for hosting was perhaps as much the desire to be part of\nthe debate as to facilitate it. It was easier for a woman to talk\npolitics in her own home than anywhere else. Although women could\nattend men\u2019s clubs\u2014at least until 1793\u2014and the\nAssembly, they could only listen. Several of the saloni\u00e8res of\nthe revolution became writers of note, including Madame Roland, Madame\nde Stael, and Sophie de Grouchy. Unfortunately, historians of the\nrevolution, starting with Michelet but continuing to these days,\nensured that they only became famous as hostesses rather than as the\nthinkers and writers they were.\n",
