    "main_text": "Associationism as a Theory of Learning\n3. Associationism as a Theory of Learning\nIn one of its senses, \u201cassociationism\u201d refers to a\ntheory of how organisms acquire concepts, associative structures,\nresponse biases, and even propositional knowledge. It is commonly\nacknowledged that associationism took hold after the publishing of\nJohn Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n (1690/1975).[3]\nHowever, Locke\u2019s comments on associationism were terse (though\nfertile), and did not address learning to any great degree. The first\nserious attempt to detail associationism as a theory of learning was\ngiven by Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature\n (1738/1975).[4]\nHume\u2019s associationism was, first and foremost, a theory\nconnecting how perceptions (\u201cImpressions\u201d) determined\ntrains of thought (successions of \u201cIdeas\u201d). Hume\u2019s\nempiricism, as enshrined in the Copy\n Principle,[5]\ndemanded that there were no Ideas in the mind that were not first\ngiven in experience. For Hume, the principles of association\nconstrained the functional role of Ideas once they were copied from\nImpressions: if Impressions IM1 and IM2 were associated in\nperception, then their corresponding Ideas, ID1 and ID2 would also\nbecome associated. In other words, the ordering of Ideas was\ndetermined by the ordering of the Impressions that caused the Ideas\nto arise.\nHume\u2019s theory then needs to analyze what types of associative\nrelations between Impressions mattered for determining the ordering\nof Ideas. Hume\u2019s analysis consisted of three types of\nassociative relations: cause and effect, contiguity, and\nresemblance. If two Impressions instantiated one of these associative\nrelations, then their corresponding Ideas would mimic the same\n instantiation.[6]\nFor instance, if Impression IM1 was cotemporaneous with Impression\nIM2, then (ceteris paribus) their corresponding Ideas, ID1\nand ID2, would become associated.\nAs stated, Hume\u2019s associationism was mostly a way of\ndetermining the functional profile of Ideas. But we have not yet said\nwhat it is for two Ideas to be associated (for that\n see section 4). Instead, one can see\nHume\u2019s contribution as introducing a very influential type of\nlearning\u2014associative learning\u2014for Hume\u2019s theory\npurports to explain how we learn to associate certain Ideas. We\ncan abstract away from Hume\u2019s framework of ideas and his\naccount of the specific relations that underlie associative learning,\nand state the theory of associative learning more generally: if two\ncontents of experiences, X and Y, instantiate some\nassociative relation, R, then those contents will become\nassociated, so that future activations of X will tend to\nbring about activations of Y. The associationist then has\nto explain what relation R amounts to. The Humean form of\nassociative learning (where R is equated with cause and\neffect, contiguity, or resemblance) has been hugely influential,\ninforming the accounts of those such as Jeremy Bentham, J.S. Mill,\n and Alexander Bain (see, e.g., the entries on\n John Stuart Mill and\n 19th Century Scottish Philosophy).[7]\nAssociative learning didn\u2019t hit its stride until the work of\nIvan Pavlov, which spurred the subsequent rise of the behaviorist\nmovement in psychology. Pavlov introduced the concept of classical\nconditioning as a modernized version of associative learning. For\nPavlov, classical conditioning was in part an experimental paradigm\nfor teaching animals to learn new associations between stimuli. The\ngeneral method of learning was to pair an unconditioned stimulus (US)\nwith a novel stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is just a stimulus\nthat instinctively, without training, provokes a response in an\norganism. Since this response is not itself learned, the response is\nreferred to as an \u201cunconditioned response\u201d (UR). In\nPavlov\u2019s canonical experiment, the US was a meat powder, as the\nsmell of meat automatically brought about salivation (UR) in his\ncanine subjects. The US is then paired with a neutral stimulus, such\nas a bell. Over time, the contiguity between the US and the neutral\nstimulus causes the neutral stimulus to provoke the same response as\nthe US. Once the bell starts to provoke salivation, the bell has\nbecome a \u201cconditioned stimulus\u201d (CS) and the salivating,\nwhen prompted by the bell alone, a \u201cconditioned response\u201d\n(CR). The associative learning here is learning to form new\nstimulus-response pairs between the bell and the\n salivation.[8]\nClassical conditioning is a fairly circumscribed process. It is a\n\u201cstimulus substitution\u201d paradigm where one stimulus can\nbe swapped for another to provoke a\n response.[9]\nHowever, the responses that are provoked are supposed to remain unchanged; all that\nchanges is the stimulus that gets associated with the response. Thus,\nclassical conditioning seemed to some to be too restrictive to\nexplain the panoply of novel behavior organisms appear to\n execute.[10]\nEdward Thorndike\u2019s research with cats in puzzle boxes\nbroadened the theory of associative learning by introducing the notion\nof consequences to associative learning. Thorndike expanded the notion\nof associative learning beyond instinctual behaviors and sensory\nsubstitution to genuinely novel behaviors. Thorndike\u2019s\nexperiments initially probed, e.g., how cats learned to lift a lever\nto escape the \u201cpuzzle boxes\u201d (the forbearer to\n\u201cSkinner boxes\u201d) that they were trapped in. The\ncats\u2019 behaviors, such as attempting to lift a lever, were not\nthemselves instinctual behaviors like the URs of Pavlov\u2019s\nexperiments. Additionally, the cats\u2019 behaviors were shaped by\nthe consequences that they brought on. For Thorndike it was because\nlifting the lever caused the door to open that the cats learned the\nconnection between the lever and the door. This new view of learning,\noperant conditioning (for the organism is \u201coperating\u201d on\nits environment), was not merely the passive learning of Pavlov, but a\nspecies-nonspecific, general, active theory of learning.\nThis research culminated in Thorndike\u2019s famous \u201cLaw of\nEffect\u201d (1911), the first canonical psychological law of\nassociationist learning. It asserted that responses that are\naccompanied by the organism feeling satisfied will, ceteris\nparibus, be more likely to be associated with the situation in\nwhich the behavior was executed, whereas responses that are\naccompanied with a feeling of discomfort to the animal\nwill, ceteris paribus, make the response less likely to\noccur when the organism encounters the same\n situation.[11]\nThe greater the positive or negative feelings produced, the greater\nthe likelihood that the behavior will be evinced. To this Thorndike\nadded the \u201cLaw of Exercise\u201d, that responses to situations\nwill, ceteris paribus, be more connected to those situations\nin proportion to the frequency of past pairings between situation and\nresponse. Thorndike\u2019s paradigm was popularized and extended by\nB.F. Skinner (see, e.g., Skinner 1953) who stressed the notion not\njust of consequences but of reinforcement as the basis of\nforming associations. For Skinner, a behavior would get associated\nwith a situation according to the frequency and strength of\nreinforcement that would arise as a consequence of the behavior.\nSince the days of Skinner, associative learning has come in many\ndifferent variations. But what all varieties should share with their\nhistorical predecessors is that associative learning is supposed to\nmirror the contingencies in the world without adding additional\nstructure to them (see section 9 for some examples of when supposedly associative theories smuggle in extra structure). The question of what contingencies associative\nlearning detects (that is, one\u2019s preferred analysis of what the\nassociative relation R is), is up for debate and changes\nbetween theorists.\nThe final widely shared, though less central, property of\nassociative learning concerns the domain generality of associative\nlearning. Domain generality\u2019s prevalence among associationists\nis due in large part to their traditional empiricist allegiances:\nexcising domain-specific learning mechanisms constrains the amount of\ninnate mental processes one has to posit. Thus it is no surprise to\nfind that both Hume and Pavlov assumed that associative learning could\nbe used to acquire associations between any contents, regardless of\nthe types of contents they were. For example, Pavlov writes,\nAny natural phenomenon chosen at will may be converted\ninto a conditioned stimulus. Any ocular stimulus, any desired sound,\nany odor, and the stimulation of any portion of the skin, whether by\nmechanical means or by the application of heat or cold never failed to\nstimulate the salivary glands. (Pavlov 1906: 615)\nFor Pavlov the content of the CS\ndoesn\u2019t matter. Any content will do, as long as it bears the\nright functional relationship in the organism\u2019s learning\nhistory. In that sense, the learning is domain general\u2014it\nmatters not what the content is, just the role it plays (for more on\nthis topic, see\n section 9.4).[12]\n",
