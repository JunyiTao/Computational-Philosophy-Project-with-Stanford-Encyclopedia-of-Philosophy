    "main_text": "Alternative Explanation\n3. Alternative Explanation\n\nWithout going into the familiar details, Darwinian processes fueled by\nundesigned, unplanned, chance variations that are in turn conserved or\neliminated by way of natural selection would, it is argued, over time\nproduce organisms exquisitely adapted to their environmental\n niches.[7]\n And since many of the characteristics traditionally cited as\nevidences of design just were various adaptations, evolution\nwould thus produce entities exactly fitting traditional criteria of\ndesign. Natural selection, then, unaided by intention or intervention\ncould account for the existence of many (perhaps all) of the\nRs which we find in biology. (A parallel debate can be found\nbetween those who believe that life itself requires a design\nexplanation (Meyer 2009) and those proposing naturalistic explanations;\nsee the entry on\n life.)\n\nThat was\u2014and is\u2014widely taken as meaning that design\narguments depending upon specific biological gaps would be\nweakened\u2014perhaps fatally.\n\nPremise (10)\u2014not to mention the earlier (6)\u2014would thus\nlook to simply be false. What had earlier appeared to be\npurpose (requiring intent) was now apparently revealed as\nmere unintended but successful and preserved function.\n\nOf course, relevant premises being false merely undercuts the relevant\nschemas in present form\u2014it does not necessarily refute either\nthe basic design intuition or other forms of design arguments. But\nsome critics take a much stronger line here. Richard Dawkins, for\ninstance, subtitles one of his books: \u201cWhy the evidence of\nevolution reveals a universe without design\u201d (Dawkins, 1987).\nTypically underlying claims of this sort is the belief that Darwinian\nevolution, by providing a relevant account of the origin and\ndevelopment of adaptation, diversity, and the like, has explained away\nthe alleged design in the biological realm\u2014and an attendant\ndesigner\u2014in much the same way that kinetic theory has explained\naway caloric. Indeed, this is a dominant idea underlying current\nresponses to design arguments. However, undercutting and explaining\naway are not necessarily the same thing, and exactly what explaining\naway might mean, and what a successful explaining away might require\nare typically not clearly specified. So before continuing, we need\nclarity concerning some relevant conceptual landscape.\n",
