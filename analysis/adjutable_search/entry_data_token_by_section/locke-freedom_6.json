    "main_text": "Determination of the Will\n8. Determination of the Will\nThe next important question for Locke is \u201cwhat is it\ndetermines the Will\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249\u2014the question is\nalso raised in the same Section in E1). Locke gives one answer to this\nquestion in E1, and a completely different answer in E2\u20135.  The E1\nanswer is that the will is always determined by \u201cthe greater\nGood\u201d (E1 II.xxi.29: 251), though, when he is writing more\ncarefully, Locke says that it is only \u201cthe appearance of Good,\ngreater Good\u201d that determines the will (E1 II.xxi.33: 256, E1\nII.xxi.38: 270). Regarding the good, Locke is a hedonist:\nGood and Evil\u2026are nothing but Pleasure\nand Pain, or that which occasions, or procures Pleasure or Pain to\nus. (E1\u20135 II.xxviii.5: 351\u2014see also E1\u20135 II.xx.2: 229 and E2\u20135\nII.xxi.42: 259)\nSo Locke\u2019s E1 view is that the will is determined by what\nappears to us to promise pleasure and avoid pain.\nWhen in 1692 Locke asks his friend, William Molyneux, to comment on\nthe first (1690) edition of the Essay, Molyneux expressly\nworries that Locke\u2019s E1 account of freedom appears to\n\u201cmake all Sins to proceed from our Understandings, or to be\nagainst Conscience; and not at all from the Depravity of our\nWills\u201d, and that \u201cit seems harsh to say, that a Man shall\nbe Damn\u2019d, because he understands no better than he does\u201d\n(de Beer 1979: 601).  Molyneux\u2019s point is well taken, and Locke\nacknowledges as much in his reply (de Beer 1979: 625). The source of\nthe problem for the E1 account is that, with respect to the good (at\nleast in the future), appearance does not always correspond with\nreality: it is possible for us to make mistakes about what is apt to\nproduce the greatest pleasure and the least pain. Sometimes this is\nbecause we underestimate how pleasurable future pleasures will be\n(relative to present pleasures) or overestimate how painful present\npains are (relative to future pains); and sometimes this is because we\njust make simple mistakes of fact, thinking, for example, that\nbloodletting will ease the pain of gout. As Molyneux sees it, we are\nnot responsible for many of these mistakes, and yet it seems clear\nthat we deserve (divine) punishment for making the wrong choices in\nour lives (e.g., when we choose the present pleasures of debauchery\nand villainy over the pleasures of heaven). Our sins, in other words,\nshould be understood to proceed from the defective exercise of our\nwills, rather than from the defective state of our knowledge.\nPart of Locke\u2019s answer in E2\u20135 is that what determines the\nwill is not the appearance of greater good, but rather \u201calways\nsome uneasiness\u201d (E2\u20134 II.xxi.29: 249\u2014the word\n\u201cuneasiness\u201d is italicized in E5).\n\u201cUneasiness\u201d is Locke\u2019s word for \u201c[a]ll pain\nof the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.31: 251). On this view, then, our wills are determined by pains\n(of the mind or of the body). How this answer is supposed to address\nMolyneux\u2019s concern is not, as yet, entirely clear.\nWhat, to begin, does Locke mean by \u201cdetermination\u201d?  On\na \u201ccausal\u201d reading, for a will W to be determined\nby X is for X to cause W to be exercised in a\nparticular way. One might say, for example, that fear of the tiger\ncaused Bill to choose to run away from it, and, in one sense, that\nBill\u2019s volition to run away from the tiger was determined by his\nfear of it. On a \u201cteleological\u201d reading, for a\nwill W to be determined by X is for the agent to will\nthe achievement or avoidance of X as a goal. One might say, for\nexample, that the pleasure of eating the cake determined my will in\nthe sense of fixing the content of my volition (as the volition to\nacquire the pleasure of eating the cake) (see Stuart 2013: 439;\nLoLordo 2012: 55\u201356).\nIt would be anachronistic to suppose that Locke is using the word\n\u201cdetermine\u201d as we do today when we discuss causal\ndeterminism (see the entry on \n  causal determinism). And the desire\nto avoid anachronism might lead us to adopt the teleological\ninterpretation of determination. But there are many indications in\nE2\u20135 II.xxi that Locke has something approaching the causal\ninterpretation in mind. Locke\u2019s picture of bodies, both large\nand small, is largely a mechanistic one (though he allows for\nphenomena that can\u2019t be explained mechanistically, such as\ngravitation, cohesion of body parts, and magnetism): bodies, he\nwrites, \u201cknock, impell, and resist one another,\u2026and that\nis all they can do\u201d (E1\u20135 IV.x.10: 624). And there are\nindications that this mechanistic model of corporeal behavior affects\nLocke\u2019s model of mental phenomena. Throughout the Sections of\nII.xxi added in E2\u20135, Locke talks of uneasiness moving the mind (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135 II.xxi.43\u201344: 260), setting us upon a\nchange of state or action or work (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135\nII.xxi.31: 251; E2\u20135 II.xxi.37: 255; E2\u20135 II.xxi.44: 260), working on\nthe mind (E2\u20135 II.xxi.29: 249; E2\u20135 II.xxi.33: 252), exerting pressure\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.32: 251; E2\u20135 II.xxi.45: 262), driving us (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.34: 252; E2\u20135 II.xxi.35: 253), pushing us (E2\u20135 II.xxi.34:\n252), operating on the will, sometimes forcibly (E2\u20135 II.xxi.36: 254;\nE2\u20135 II.xxi.37: 255; E2\u20135 II.xxi.57: 271), laying hold on the will\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.38: 256), influencing the will (E2\u20135 II.xxi.38: 256; E2\u20135\nII.xxi.39: 257), taking the will (E2\u20135 II.xxi.45: 262), spurring to\naction (E2\u20135 II.xxi.40: 258), carrying us into action (E2\u20135 II.xxi.53:\n268), and being counterbalanced by other mental states (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.57: 272; E2\u20135 II.xxi.65: 277). It is difficult to read all of\nthese statements without thinking that Locke thinks of uneasiness as\nexerting not merely a pull, but also a push, on the mind.\nLocke\u2019s view, then, seems to be that our volitions are caused\n(though not, perhaps, deterministically, i.e., in a way that is fixed\nby initial conditions and the laws of nature) by uneasinesses.  How is\nthis supposed to work? As Locke sees it, either \u201call pain causes\ndesire equal to it self\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.31: 251) or desire is\nsimply identified with \u201cuneasiness in the want [i.e.,\nlack] of an absent good\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.31: 251). So the desire\nthat either is or is caused by uneasiness is a desire for the removal\nof that uneasiness, and this is what proximately spurs us to take\nmeans to secure that removal.\nLocke provides evidence from observation and from \u201cthe reason\nof the thing\u201d for the claim that it is uneasiness, rather than\nperceived good, that determines the will. Empirically, Locke notes\nthat agents generally do not seek a change of state unless they\nexperience some sort of pain that leads them to will its extinction. A\npoor, indolent man who is content with his lot, even one who\nrecognizes that he would be happier if he worked his way to greater\nwealth, is not ipso facto motivated to work.  A drunkard who\nrecognizes that his health will suffer and wealth will dissipate if he\ncontinues to drink does not, merely as a result of this recognition,\nstop drinking: but if he finds himself thirsty for drink and uneasy at\nthe thought of missing his drinking companions, then he will go to the\ntavern. That is, Locke recognizes the possibility of akratic action,\ni.e., pursuing the worse in full knowledge that it is worse (E\nII.xxi.35: 253\u2013254).  (For more on Locke on akrasia, see Vailati\n1990, Glauser 2014, and Moauro and Rickless 2019.)\nRegarding \u201cthe reason of the thing\u201d, Locke claims that\n\u201cwe constantly desire happiness\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.39: 257),\nwhere happiness is \u201cthe utmost Pleasure we are capable of\u201d\n(E2\u20135 II.xxi.42: 258). Moreover, he says, any amount of uneasiness is\ninconsistent with happiness, \u201ca little pain serving to marr all\nthe pleasure\u201d we experience. Locke concludes from this that we\nare always motivated to get rid of pain before securing any particular\npleasure (E2\u20135 II.xxi.36: 254). Locke also argues that absent goods\ncannot move the will, because they don\u2019t exist yet; by contrast,\non his theory, the will is determined by something that already exists\nin the mind, namely uneasiness (E2\u20135 II.xxi.37:\n254\u2013255). Finally, Locke argues that if the will were determined\nby the perceived greater good, every agent would be consistently\nfocused on the attainment of \u201cthe infinite eternal Joys of\nHeaven\u201d. But, as is evidently the case, many agents are far more\nconcerned about other matters than they are about getting into\nheaven. And this entails that the will must be determined by something\nother than the perceived greater good, namely, uneasiness (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.38: 255\u2013256). (For interesting criticisms of these\narguments, see Stuart 2013: 453\u2013456.)\nSo far, Locke has argued that the wrong turns we make in life do\nnot usually proceed from defects in our understandings. What spurs us\nto act or forbear acting is not perception of the greater good, but\nsome uneasiness instead. This answers part, but not the whole, of\nMolyneux\u2019s worry. What Locke still needs to explain is why\nagents can be justly held responsible for choices that are motivated\nby uneasinesses. After all, what level of pain we feel and when we\nfeel it is oftentimes not within our control. Locke\u2019s answer\nrelies on what has come to be known as the \u201cdoctrine of\nsuspension\u201d.\n",
