    "main_text": "Symmetry Principles || Relativity\n2.1 Relativity\n2.1.1 The special theory of relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity (STR) is constructed on\nthe basis of two fundamental postulates. One is the light postulate\n(that the speed of light, in the \u201crest frame\u201d, is\nindependent of the speed of the source), and the other is the\nprinciple of relativity. The latter was adopted by Einstein explicitly\nas a means of restricting the form of the laws, whatever their\ndetailed structure might turn out to be. Thus, we have the difference\nbetween a \u201cconstructive\u201d and a \u201cprinciple\u201d\ntheory: in the former case we build our theory based on known facts\nabout the constitution and behaviour of material bodies; in the latter\ncase we start by restricting the possible form of such a theory by\nadopting certain\n principles.[9]\n\nThe principle of relativity as adopted by Einstein (1905, p. 395 of\nthe English translation) simply asserts that:\n\nThe laws by which the states of physical systems undergo changes are\nindependent of whether these changes of states are referred to one or\nthe other of two coordinate systems moving relatively to each other in\nuniform translational motion.\n\n\nThis principle, when combined with the light postulate (and certain\nother assumptions), leads to the Lorentz transformations, these being\nthe transformations between coordinate systems moving uniformly with\nrespect to one another according to STR. According to STR the laws of\nphysics are invariant under Lorentz transformations, and indeed under\nthe full Poincar\u00e9 group of transformations. These\ntransformations differ from the Galilean transformations of Newtonian\nmechanics. H. Minkowski reformulated STR, showing that space and time\nare part of a single four-dimensional geometry, Minkowski spacetime.\nIn this way, the Poincar\u00e9 group of symmetry transformations is\npart of the structure of spacetime in STR, and for this reason these\nsymmetries have been labelled \u201cgeometric symmetries\u201d by\nWigner (1967, especially pp. 15 and 17\u201319).\n\nThere is a debate in the literature concerning how the principle of\nrelativity, and more generally the global space-time symmetries,\nshould be understood. On one approach, the significance of space-time\nsymmetries is captured by considering the structure of a theory\nthrough transformations on its models, those models consisting of\ndifferentiable manifolds endowed with various geometric objects and\nrelations (see Anderson, 1967, and Norton, 1989). According to Brown\nand Sypel (1995) and Budden (1997), this approach fails to recognise\nthe central importance of effectively isolated subsystems, the\nempirical significance of symmetries resting on the possibility of\ntransforming such a subsystem (rather than applying the transformation\nto the entire universe). For further developments in this debate,\nincluding applications to local symmetries and to gauge theories, see\nKosso (2000), Brading and Brown (2004), Healey (2007), Healey (2009),\nGreaves and Wallace (2014), Friederich (2015), Rovelli (2014), Teh\n(2015, 2016) and Wallace (2022).\n\nThe global spacetime invariance principles are intended to be valid\nfor all the laws of nature, for all the processes that unfold in the\nspacetime. This universal character is not shared by the physical\nsymmetries that were next introduced in physics. Most of these were of\nan entirely new kind, with no roots in the history of science, and in\nsome cases expressly introduced to describe specific forms of\ninteractions \u2014 whence the name \u201cdynamical\nsymmetries\u201d due to Wigner (1967, see especially pp. 15,\n17\u201318, 22\u201327, 33).\n2.1.2 The general theory of relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity (GTR) was also\nconstructed using a symmetry principle at its heart: the principle of\ngeneral covariance. Much ink has been spilled over the significance\nand role of general covariance in GTR, including by Einstein\n himself.[10]\n For a long time he viewed the principle of general covariance as an\nextension of the principle of relativity found in both classical\nmechanics and STR, and this is a view that continues to provoke\nvigorous debate. Norton (2003) discusses the \u201cKretschmann\nobjection\u201d to the physical significance of general covariance.\nOn invariance versus covariance, see Anderson (1967), Brown and\nBrading (2002), and Martin (2003, Section 2.2). What is clear is that\nthe mere requirement that a theory be generally covariant represents\nno restriction on the form of the theory; further stipulations must be\nadded, such as the requirement that there be no \u201cabsolute\nobjects\u201d (this itself being a problematic notion). Once some\nsuch further requirements are added, however, the principle of general\ncovariance becomes a powerful tool. For a recent review and analysis\nof this debate, see Pitts (2006).\n\nIn Einstein\u2019s hands the principle of general covariance was a\ncrucial postulate in the development of\n GTR.[11]\n The diffeomorphism freedom of GTR, i.e., the invariance of the form\nof the laws under transformations of the coordinates depending\nsmoothly on arbitrary functions of space and time, is a\n\u201clocal\u201d spacetime symmetry, in contrast to the\n\u201cglobal\u201d spacetime symmetries of STR (which depend instead\non constant parameters). For a discussion of coordinate-based\napproaches to the diffeomorphism invariance of General Relativity, see\nWallace (2019), and for more on the physical interpretation of this\ninvariance, see Pooley (2017). Such local symmetries are\n\u201cdynamical\u201d symmetries in Wigner\u2019s sense, since they\ndescribe a particular interaction, in this case gravity. As is well\nknown, the spacetime metric in GTR is no longer a\n\u201cbackground\u201d field or an \u201cabsolute object\u201d,\nbut instead it is a dynamical player, the gravitational field\nmanifesting itself as spacetime curvature.\n\nThe extension of the concept of continuous symmetry from\n\u201cglobal\u201d symmetries (such as the Galilean group of\nspacetime transformations) to \u201clocal\u201d symmetries is one of\nthe important developments in the concept of symmetry in physics that\ntook place in the twentieth century. Prompted by GTR, Weyl\u2019s\n1918 \u201cunified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism\u201d\nextended the idea of local symmetries (see Ryckman, 2003, and Martin,\n2003), and although this theory is generally deemed to have failed,\nthe theory contains the seeds of later success in the context of\nquantum theory (see below,\n Section 2.5).\n\nMeanwhile, Hilbert and Klein undertook detailed investigations\nconcerning the role of general covariance in theories of gravitation,\nand enlisted the assistance of Noether in their debate over the status\nof energy conservation in such theories. This led to Noether\u2019s\nfamous 1918 paper containing two theorems, the first of which leads to\na connection between global symmetries and conservation laws, and the\nsecond of which leads to a number of results associated with local\nsymmetries, including a demonstration of the different status of the\nconservation laws when the global symmetry group is a subgroup of some\nlocal symmetry group of the theory in question (see Brading and Brown,\n2003). A detailed, recent collective volume on the\nphilosophy and physics of Noether\u2019s theorems is Read\nand Teh  (2022).  \n",
