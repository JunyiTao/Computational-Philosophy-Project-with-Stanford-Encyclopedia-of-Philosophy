Philip\u2019s Innovative Theory of the Transcendentals\n\n\nPhilip\u2019s influence in the thirteenth century was especially felt\nin the area of the transcendentals and in action theory. In this\nsection, I will consider his theory of the transcendentals (although\nhe does not in fact use that term; see Aertsen 2012). I will examine\nhis theory of action in the following section. To some extent, the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals has its roots in the\nChristian-Platonic discussions of the relationship between created and\ndivine being and goodness, in particular, in Boethius\u2019s De\nhebdomadibus, which greatly influenced William of Auxerre\u2019s\ntreatment of goodness prefatory to his examination of the virtues\nin Summa aurea (see Aertsen 2012).  However, its more\nimmediate ancestor is Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the categories\n(see MacDonald 1992). Certain properties fall into none of\nAristotle\u2019s categories; rather they are properties of all of the\nthings to which the categories are applicable. For this reason, these\nproperties are said to \u201ctranscend\u201d the\ncategories. Although there is some variation in what is counted as a\ntranscendental, the list generally included being, unity, truth, and\ngoodness. Thus, everything that falls into any of Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories is a being, has a certain sort of unity, and is true and\ngood to a certain extent. \n\n\nNot only do these properties transcend the categories and as a result,\napply to everything classified by the categories, but they are held to\nbe convertible with each other as well. This could mean one of two\nthings. The transcendentals could be coextensional, so that whatever\nhas being also has unity, truth, and goodness. This leaves open the\npossibility that the transcendentals are separate and distinct from\none another. The second option of the convertibility thesis involves a\nstronger claim, namely, the idea that the transcendentals differ from\none another only in concept, not in reality. Unity, truth, and\ngoodness add nothing to a particular being over and above what is\nalready there; everything that is a being is also one, true, and good\nin virtue of the very same characteristics. But to describe something\nas a being and to describe it as, say, good is to express two\ndifferent things about it since the concept of a being and the concept\nof a good are two very different concepts. Thus, while being and\ngoodness are extensionally equivalent, they are intensionally\ndistinct.\n\n\nPhilip adopts the second notion of convertibility. The various\ntranscendentals do not differ in reality, only in concept. The concept\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\nreality, and a thing\u2019s goodness adds nothing over and above the\nthing\u2019s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\nwhile differing intensionally.\n\n\nIt has been argued (by Pouillion and others) that Philip\u2019s\ndiscussion of the transcendentals in Summa de bono represents\nthe earliest formal treatise on the transcendentals in the history of\nWestern philosophy (see Pouillion 1939, Aertsen 2012). About ten years\nearlier, William of Auxerre also discussed the relationship between\nbeing and goodness; he raises the issue of whether being and being\ngood are the same. But in resolving this issue, William never\nconsiders the central issue of the transcendentals, the idea that they\nare extensionally equivalent while intensionally different. It appears\nthat Philip is the first to do so.  MacDonald argues that\nPhilip\u2019s greater familiarity with the metaphysical works of\nAristotle and the Arabic commentators accounts for the startling\ninnovations of his work on the transcendentals (MacDonald 1992). It is\nlikely that Philip encountered the fundamental notion of extensional\nequivalence and intensional difference in the work of the Arabic\ncommentators of Aristotle; both Avicenna and Averroes argue that unity\nand being have the same extension while differing conceptually. Philip\nextends this idea to include not only being and unity, but also the\ntrue and the good. Philip\u2019s work in turn sets the stage for the\ndevelopment of this topic throughout the thirteenth century,\ninfluencing the work of such notable thinkers as Alexander of Hales,\nAlbert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas (see Aertsen 2012).\n",
