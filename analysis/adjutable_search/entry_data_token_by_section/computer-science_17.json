    "main_text": "Implementation || Implementation as the Relation Specification-Artifact\n5.2 Implementation as the Relation Specification-Artifact\n\nThe fact that correctness criteria for the implementation relation are\nprovided by the abstract level\u00a0induces Turner (2012, 2014, 2018)\nto define implementation as the relation\nspecification-artefact. As examined in\n \u00a72,\n specifications have correctness jurisdiction over artifacts, that is,\nthey prescribe the allowed behaviors of artifacts. Also recall that\nartifacts can be both abstract and concrete entities, and that any LoA\ncan play the role of specification for lower levels. This amounts to\nsaying that the specification-artefact relation is able to define any\nimplementation relation across the layered ontology of computational\nsystems.\n\nDepending on how the specification-artifact relation is defined,\nTurner (2012) distinguishes as many as three different notions of\nimplementation. Consider the case of a physical machine implementing a\ngiven abstract machine. According to an intentional notion of\nimplementation, an abstract machine works as a specification for a\nphysical machine, provided it advances all the functional requirements\nthe latter must fulfill, i.e., it specifies (in principle) all the\nallowed behaviors of the implementing physical machine. According to\nan extensional notion of implementation, a physical machine\nis a correct implementation of an abstract machine if and only if\nisomorphisms can be established mapping states of the latter to states\nof the former, and transitions in the abstract machine correspond to\nactual executions (computational traces) of the artifact. Finally, an\nempirical notion of implementation requires the physical\nmachine to display computations that match those prescribed by the\nabstract machine; that is to say, correct implementation has to be\nevaluated empirically through testing.\n\nPrimiero (2020) underlines how, while this approach addresses the\nissue of correctness and miscomputation as it allows to distinguish a\ncorrect from an incorrect implementation, it still identifies a unique\nimplementation relation between a specification level and an artifact\nlevel. Again, if this account is allowed to involve the layered\nontology of computational systems by reinterpreting each time any LoA\neither as a specification or artifact, Turner\u2019s account prevents\nfrom referring to more than one level at the same time as the cause of\nmiscomputation:\u00a0a\u00a0miscomputation always occurs here as an\nincorrect implementation of a specification by an artifact. By\ndefining implementation as a relation holding accross all the LoAs,\none would be able to identify multiple incorrect implementations which\ndo not directly refer to the abstract specification. A miscomputation\nmay indeed be caused by an incorrect implementation of lower levels\nwhich is then inherited all the way down to the execution level.\n",
