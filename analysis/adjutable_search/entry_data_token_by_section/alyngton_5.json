    "main_text": "Relations and Relatives\n6. Relations and Relatives\n\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of relations and relatives in the\nCategories is opaque and incomplete, since (1) he does not\nhave any notion of relation, as he speaks of relatives and conceives\nof them as those entities to which non-absolute terms of our language\nrefer; (2) he does not discuss the question of the reality of\nrelatives; (3) he does not clarify the connection between the two defi\nnitions of relatives he proposes in the seventh chapters of the\nCategories; (4) he does not give any effective criterion for\ndistinguishing relatives from some items belonging to other categories\n(cf. Ackrill 1963, pp. 98\u2013103). Because of these\nfacts, in the Late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages many authors tried\nto reformulate the doctrine of relatives. The most successful and\ninteresting attempt was that of the Neoplatonic commentators of the\nsixth century, such as Olympiodorus, Philoponus, and Simplicius.\nUnlike Aristotle, they were able to elaborate a notion of relation\n(schesis) almost equivalent to our modern notion of two-place\npredicates, as they conceived of relations as abstract forms whose\ndistinctive feature was the property of being present-in and joining\ntwo different substances at once. This view was rejected by Latin\nmedieval authors. According to Boethius relation (respectus or\nhabitudo) is an accidental form which is in a substance (its substrate\nof inherence) and simply entails a reference to another, without\ninhering in that other. Shortly after the middle of the13th century,\nAlbert the Great explicitly denied that a relation could inhere (in\nthe technical sense of the word) in two substances at once (Liber\nde praedicamentis, tr. 4, cap. 10). Some years later, the same\nthesis was held by Simon of Faversham (Quaestiones in librum\nPraedicamentorum, q. 43). In the 14th century, also Walter Burley\nshared this approach, since it appeared to him to be the only thing\nconsistent with one of the basic principle of medieval metaphysics:\nthe equivalence and correspondence between accidental forms and their\nsubstrates of inherence, so that no accidental form could inhere at\nthe same time and in full in two (or more) substances (cf. Burley,\nExpositio super librum Sex principiorum, cap. de\nhabitu). On the contrary, Wyclif seems to support a different\nopinion, similar to that of the Neoplatonists , as he maintained that\nrelation (1) is different from quality and quantity, since it\npresupposes them, and (2) qua such is a sort of link between two\nthings (cf. Wyclif, De ente praedicamentali,\nch. 7. p. 61).\nAlyngton\u2019s theory of ad aliquid is worthy of note,\nas he possibly was the only late medieval author who followed and\ndeveloped Wyclif \u2019s ideas on that topic.  He conceived of\nrelation (relatio) as an accidental form which is present in\nboth the relatives at once \u2013 even though in different ways,\nsince it names only one of them. Consequently his relation can be\nconsidered as a sort of ontological counterpart of our modern\nfunctions with two variables, or two-place predicates (In\nCat., cap. de relativis, pp. 295\u201396).  According\nto Alyngton, whose account partially differs from that of Wyclif, in\nthe act of relating one substance to another four distinct\nconstitutive elements can be singled out: (1) the relation itself\n\u2013 for instance, the form of paternity; (2) the subject of the\nrelation, that is, the substance that denominatively receives the name\nof the relation \u2013 for instance, the (substance that is the)\nfather; (3) the object of the relation, that is, the substance which\nthe subject of the relation is connected with \u2013 for instance,\nthe (substance that is the) son; and (4) the foundation\n(fundamentum) of the relation, that is, the absolute entity\nin virtue of which the relation inheres in the subject and in the\nobject (ibidem, p. 299). The foundation is the main\ncomponent, since it joins the relation to the underlying substances,\nlets the relation link the substrate to the object, and transmits some\nof its properties to the relation (ibidem, p.  291). Like\nWyclif, Alyngton affirms that only qualities and quantities can be the\nfoundation of a relation (ibidem). Some consequences about\nthe nature and status of relations and relatives derive from these\npremises: (1) relation is a categorial item whose reality is feebler\nthan that of any other accidental form, as it depends upon the\nsimultaneous existence of three different items: the subject, the\nobject, and the foundation (ibidem, p. 295). (2) A relation\ncan start inhering in a substance without any change in the latter,\nbut simply because of a change in another substance. For example:\ngiven two things, one white and the other black, if the black thing\nbecomes white, then, because of this change, a new accident, that is,\na relation of similarity, will inhere also in the fi rst thing, apart\nfrom any other change in it. (3) All the real relatives (relativa\nsecundum esse) are simultaneous by nature, since the real cause of\nbeing a relative is relation, which at the same time inheres in two\nsubstances, thereby making both ones relatives (ibidem,\np. 301). On this basis Alyngton can divide relations into\ntranscendental and categorial relations (ibidem, pp.\n290\u201391), and, what is more, among the latter he can contrast\nreal relatives (relativa secundum esse) with relatives of\nreason (relativa rationis) without utilizing references to\nour mental activities nor to semantic principles. In fact, on the one\nhand, Alyngton describes real relatives as those aggregates (1) made\nup of a primary substance, (2) an absolute accidental form (quantity\nor quality), and (3) a relation which correlates the substance at\nissue to another substance existing in actu. On the other hand, he\ndefi ne relatives of reason as those aggregates characterized by the\noccurrence of at least one of these negative conditions: (1) either\nthe relation\u2019s subject of inherence or its object is not a\nsubstance; (2) the object is not an actual entity; (3) the foundation\nof the relation is not an absolute accident (ibidem, p. 293).\nThe strategy which supports this choice is evident: Alyngton wanted to\nsubstitute references to mental activity with references to the\nexternal world, thus using only objective criteria, based on the\nframework of reality itself in order to classifying things.\n",
