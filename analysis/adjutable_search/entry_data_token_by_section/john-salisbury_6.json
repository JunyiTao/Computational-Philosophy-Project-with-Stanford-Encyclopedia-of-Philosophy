    "main_text": "Naturalism\n7. Naturalism\n\nAnother substantive philosophical issue John of Salisbury engages is\nthe role played by nature in the foundations of social and political\norder, an interest evident across his works. That John adopts a\nnaturalistic framework in the Policraticus might seem\nsensible, but it appears also as a crucial feature of the\nMetalogicon, wherein John develops the Ciceronian theme that\nhumans are transformed from animalistic primordial beings into civil\ncreatures as a consequence of the realization of the inhering human\ncapacities of reason and language. Thus, education forms a highly\nrelevant element of his naturalism.\n\nJohn\u2019s appeal to a Ciceronian conception of the natural\nfoundations of society in the Metalogicon arises out of his\nattempt to refute the doctrine, ascribed to the possibly fictional\nCornificius and his followers, that the qualities and powers with\nwhich men are born constitute the limit of their knowledge and\nfaculties (Tobin 1989). Under this view, human beings ought not to\nseek to improve their condition or to develop their minds and skills,\nrelying instead on God\u2019s redemptive grace, while shunning the\nmaterial world and their own natures completely (ML: 137,\n141\u201342). In opposition to Cornificius, John argues that the\nmundane and sinful character of human nature does not end the debate.\nRather, God through nature has granted to mankind the capacity to\nimprove its lot by diligent application of the native faculties of\nreason and speech. This is not to say that John considers man\u2019s\nnature (in Aristotelian terms) to be wholly perfectible; grace is\nstill required. Yet men may accomplish much by nature alone, contrary\nto the Cornifician teaching that no attempt can (or perhaps should) be\nmade to develop post-lapsarian man (ML: 125\u201326).\n\nA major pillar supporting John\u2019s case against the Cornificians\nis an adapted version of Cicero\u2019s depiction of the primitive\ndevelopment of human association. John deploys his source in order to\ndemonstrate that social interaction among men is an important\nwell-spring of true (albeit partial, because merely mortal) happiness\nor blessedness (beatitudo). The Metalogicon regards\nnature (in Stoic fashion), \u201cthe most benign parent and governor\nof all things in order most due\u201d, as imprinted with a divine\nplan (ML: 124). Thus, if nature has granted to man alone the powers of\nspeech and reason, this is so he may \u201cgain blessedness\u201d\n(ML: 125). Such a plan emerges from the rational observation of the\nstructure of the universe:\n\n\n[T]he one and true God, in order to bind the parts of the universe in\na firm alliance and to keep charity alive, ordered them in such a way\nthat one thing needed the help of another, and one made good the\ndeficiency of another, every single one being as it were a member of\nevery other one. All things if separated from one another are thus\nonly half complete, but are made perfect when allied to others, since\nall things are held together by mutual support. (ML: 125)\n\n\nThis theme of reciprocity imbues John\u2019s corpus, employed in his\ncorrespondence and forming the basis of his organic metaphor for the\npolity (addressed below) (see JL1: 181). In the Metalogicon,\nthis universal model of mutual interconnection indicates the natural\ncourse which ought to guide human behavior: \u201c[I]t is not\npossible even to imagine a kind of blessedness which knows nothing of\ncommunion or exists outside society\u201d, John declares, because\nnature decrees that earthly happiness derives from human association\n(ML: 125). To imperil society by assailing man\u2019s capacity to\nimprove his rational powers\u2014an accusation which John levels\nagainst Cornificius\u2014is thus to cut man off from the happiness\nwhich God has allotted to him in the present life, as well as to\nexclude the possibility of fulfilling the terms of divinely bestowed\ngrace.\n\nJohn\u2019s view is that man\u2019s rational faculty demands a level\nof sociability unparalleled in nature. In Ciceronian fashion, the\nMetalogicon argues that reason\u2019s discovery of the\nnaturalness of association is not sufficient, because such individual\nrealization can never generate the community that it knows to be\nnatural to and beneficial for human existence. Speech is the mechanism\nby which mute wisdom translates its insights into public proclamations\nand persuades men to follow their natural inclination by surrendering\ntheir private interests in favor of the common good (ML: 126). Should\nhumans retain their rational abilities yet be deprived of speech,\n\u201cthey will become brute beasts, and \u2026 cities will seem\nlike farmyards rather than gatherings of human beings united in the\nbonds of society\u201d (ML: 126). Enlightened eloquence, however,\n\n\ngave birth to so many glorious cities \u2026 and bound so many\npeoples in the bonds of charity, that whoever strives to put asunder\nwhat God has joined together for the common benefit of all would\nrightly be accounted the common enemy of all. (ML: 126)\n\n\nJohn\u2019s vision of society is comparable to Cicero\u2019s in its\nquasi-contractual quality, in that human association requires, beyond\ngeographic proximity, explicit agreement to share a common life in all\nof the features that compose a community. Only the eloquent use of\nlanguage can convince selfish men that by nature they prefer the\ncommon good to personal welfare. In this regard, John\u2019s reliance\non Cicero is pronounced: The Metalogicon presumes that the\nbond of association among men is simultaneously a product of their\nactive cooperation, a natural, but not purely natural (in contrast to\nAristotle), outcome.\n\nThe real significance of the Cornifician position lies in its\nopposition to \u201call cities simultaneously and the whole of civil\nlife\u201d, since, by claiming that men should not develop their\ncapacities for reason and speech, any opportunity for man to associate\nis in the process denied (ML: 127). The Cornifician error is to\ninterpret the fixity of post-lapsarian human nature as a permanent\ncondition, whereas, if this were correct, society could never have\nbeen formed originally, let alone maintained. Yet, John recognizes\nthat conscious effort is required if men are to join together in\ncommunal life. John conceives of human association as a process of man\nrefining and improving his own abilities in order to aid the cause of\nnature. The Metalogicon\u2019s understanding of the genesis\nof society is profoundly indebted to Cicero\u2019s notion that\nnature\u2019s endowment is only a point of departure which men must\ndevelop and shape if they are truly to live in accordance with their\nown natural inclinations.\n\nThis commitment to naturalism is perhaps even more on display in the\nPolicraticus, in which John repeatedly asserts that\n\u201cnature is the best guide to living\u201d (PC: 27, 127, 201).\nThe Policraticus follows the teaching in the\nMetalogicon that, while nature provides the foundation for\nhuman capabilities, they are only potentialities. \u201cThe beginning\nof each thing is from nature\u201d, John observes, but people may\n(and should) develop their natural capacities by means of practice\nuntil they master their art, a principle that \u201cobtains in\nliberal and mechanical occupations\u201d alike (PC: 125). While\nnature offers a model for human conduct and association, the natural\nscheme for living well may only be realized with the cooperation of\npeople who partake in it.\n",
