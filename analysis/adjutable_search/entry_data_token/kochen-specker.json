Introduction\n\n\nQM has the peculiar property that quantum-mechanical states imply, in\ngeneral, only statistical restrictions on the results of\nmeasurements.  The natural conclusion to be drawn is that these\nstates are incomplete descriptions of quantum systems. QM, thus,\nwould be incomplete in the sense that a typical QM state description\nof an individual system could be supplemented with a more complete\ndescription in terms of an HV theory. In an HV description of the\nsystem the QM probabilities would be naturally interpreted as\nepistemic probabilities of the sort that arise in ordinary\nstatistical mechanics. Such an HV description might not be\npractically useful, but one is tempted to think that it should at\nleast be possible in principle. There are, however, two powerful\ntheorems to the effect that such a description is subject to severe \nconstraints: QM, given certain at least prima facie plausible premises, \ncannot be supplemented by an HV theory. The more famous of these two \ntheorems is Bell\u2019s theorem which states that, given a premise of\nlocality, an HV model cannot match the statistical predictions of\nQM. The second important no-go theorem against HV theories is the\ntheorem of Kochen and Specker (KS) which states that, given a premise\nof noncontextuality (to be explained presently) certain sets of QM\nobservables cannot consistently be assigned values at all (even\nbefore the question of their statistical distributions arises).\n\n\nBefore seeing the workings of the KS theorem in some detail, we must\nclarify why it is of importance to philosophers of science. The\nexplicit premise of HV interpretations, as understood throughout\nbelow, is one of value\ndefiniteness:\n(VD) All observables defined for a QM system have definite\nvalues at all times.\n\n\n(Note that for \nBohmian Mechanics\n often viewed as an HV interpretation of QM, this statement would have \nto be qualified.)\n[1]\nVD is motivated by an apparently innocuous assumption about\nexperimental results, which is reflected in the custom of referring to\nquantum experiments as \"measurements,\" namely, that these experiments\nreveal vales that exist independently of being measured. (Note that we\ndo not need to assume here that the values are faithfully revealed by\nmeasurement, but only that they exist!) This suggest a second,\nseemingly innocuous assumption, that of noncontextuality:\n(NC) If a QM system possesses a property (value of an\nobservable), then it does so independently of any measurement\ncontext, i.e. independently of how that value is eventually\nmeasured.\n\n\nWhen applied to specific properties that can be measured in different\nincompatible measurements, NC says that these properties are the same\nin these different measurement situations.\n\nNow, suppose we adopt the usual association of properties of a quantum\nsystem, that is, yes-no observables, and projection operators on the\nsystem\u2019s Hilbert space.\n(O) There is a one-one correspondence between properties\nof a quantum system and projection operators on the system\u2019s Hilbert\nspace\n\nThe KS theorem establishes a contradiction between VD + NC + O  and QM;\nthus, acceptance of QM logically forces us to renounce either VD or\nNC or O.\n\nIf a HV theory satisfying these conditions were feasible, we would\nhave a natural explanation of the statistical character of QM, and an\nelegant way of resolving the infamous measurement problem haunting all\ninterpreters of QM (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory\n for details). What the KS theorem shows is that a HV theory of the most\n straightforward sort, satisfying these conditions, is not an option.  \nThe HV program is left with  only options that violate one or more of\n these conditions; see entries on\n Bohmian mechanics and\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n2. Background to the KS Theorem\n\n\nIn the following, we will presuppose some familiarity with elementary\nQM notions like \u2018state\u2019, \u2018observable\u2019,\n\u2018value\u2019 and their mathematical representatives\n\u2018vector\u2019, \u2018(self-adjoint) operator\u2019 and\n\u2018eigenvalue\u2019 [see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n for details]. We will usually identify the observables and the operators\non an appropriate Hilbert space which represent them; if there is a\nneed to distinguish operators and observables, we write the operators\nunderlined and in boldface. (Thus an operator\nA represents an observable A.)\n\n\nThe present section states some elements of the historical and\nsystematic background of the KS theorem. Most importantly, an argument\nby von Neumann (1932), a theorem by Gleason (1957), and a critical\ndiscussion of both plus a later argument by Bell (1966) have to be\nconsidered. Von Neumann, in his famous 1932 book Die mathematischen\nGrundlagen der Quantenmechanik, disputed the possibility of\nproviding QM with an HV underpinning. He gave an argument that boils\ndown to the following: Consider the mathematical fact that, if\nA and B are\nself-adjoint operators, then any real linear combination of them (any\nC = \n \u03b1A +\n \u03b2B, where\n \u03b1,\n \u03b2 are arbitrary real\nnumbers) is also a self-adjoint operator. QM further dictates that:\n\nIf A and B (represented by self-adjoint operators\nA and B) are\nobservables on a system, then there is an observable C\n(represented by self-adjoint operator C defined\nas before) on the same system. \nIf, for any QM state, the expectation values of A\nand B are given by <A> and <B>,\nthen the expectation value of C is given by\n<C>=\u03b1<A> +\n\u03b2<B>.\n\n\n\nNow consider A, B, C, as above, and assume\nthey have definite values v(A),\nv(B), v(C). Consider a\n\u2018hidden state\u2019 V which determines\nv(A), v(B),\nv(C). We can then derive from V trivial\n\u2018expectation values\u2019 which are just the possessed values\nthemselves: <A>V =\nv(A), and so\n on.[2]\n Of course, these \u2018expectation values\u2019 do not, in general,\nequal the QM ones: <A>V \u2260\n<A> (we would indeed think of the latter as averages\nover the former for different hidden states V!). However, von\nNeumann requires that the <A>V,\nlike the <A>, conform to (2). This automatically\nentails that the values themselves must conform to a condition\nparallel to (2), i.e.:\n\nv(C) = \u03b1v(A) +\n\u03b2v(B).\n\n\n\nThis, however, is impossible, in general. An example very easily\nshows how (3) is violated, but because of its simplicity it also\nshows the argument\u2019s inadequacy. (This example is not due to von\nNeumann himself, but to\n Bell![3]) \n Let A = \u03c3x and B =\n\u03c3y, then operator C = (\u03c3x +\n\u03c3y)/\u221a2 corresponds to the observable of the\nspin component along the direction bisecting x and\ny. Now all spin components have (in suitable units) possible\nvalues \u00b11 only, thus, the HV proponent is forced to ascribe\n\u00b11 to A, B, C as values, and thus as\n\u2018expectation values\u2019. But (3) now obviously cannot be\nfulfilled, since \u00b11 \u2260 (\u00b11 + \u00b11)/\u221a2.\n\n\nThe example illustrates why von Neumann\u2019s argument is\nunsatisfying. Nobody disputes the move from (2) to (3) for compatible\nobservables, i.e. those which, according to QM, are jointly measurable\nin one arrangement. The above choice of A, B,\nC, however, is such that any two of them are incompatible,\ni.e. are not jointly observable. For these we will not want to require\nany HV interpretation to meet (3), but only (2). The hidden values\nneed not conform with (3) in general, only the averages of their\nvalues in a series of tests must conform with (2). The authority of\nvon Neumann\u2019s argument comes from the fact that requirements (1) and\n(2), for QM states, are consequences of the QM formalism, but\nthis does not in itself justify extending these requirements to the\nhypothetical hidden states. Indeed, if (3) were\nunrestrictedly true, this would nicely explain, in the presence of\nhidden values, why (2) is. Von Neumann apparently thought that the HV\nproponent is committed to this explanation, but this seems an\nimplausible restriction.\n\n\nThe KS theorem remedies this defect, and thus strengthens the case\nagainst HV theories insofar as it assumes (3) only for sets of\nobservables {A, B,\nC} which are all mutually compatible. The theorem requires\nthat only for compatible observables assumption (3) must hold.\n\n\nA second, independent line of thought leading to the KS theorem is\nprovided by Gleason\u2019s theorem (Gleason 1957). The theorem states that\non a Hilbert space of dimension greater than or equal to 3, the only\npossible probability measures are the measures\n\u03bc(P\u03b1) = Tr(P\u03b1\nW), where P\u03b1 is a projection\noperator, W is the statistical operator characterizing the\nsystem\u2019s actual state and Tr is the trace \n operation.[4]\n The P\u03b1 can be understood as representing\nyes-no observables, i.e. questions for whether a QM system\n\u2018living\u2019 in such a Hilbert space has a property \u03b1 or\nnot, and every possible property \u03b1 is associated uniquely with a\nvector |\u03b1> in the space \u2014 so, the task is to\nunambiguously assign probabilities to all vectors in the space. Now,\nthe QM measure \u03bc is continuous, so Gleason\u2019s theorem in effect\nproves that every probability assignment to all the possible\nproperties in a three-dimensional Hilbert space must be\ncontinuous, i.e. must map all vectors in the space continuously\ninto the interval [0, 1]. On the other hand, an HV theory (if\ncharacterized by VD + NC) would imply that of every property we can\nsay whether the system has it or not. This yields a trivial\nprobability function which maps all the P\u03b1\nto either 1 or 0, and, provided that values 1 and 0 both occur (which\nfollows trivially from interpreting the numbers as probabilities),\nthis function must clearly be discontinuous (cf. Redhead 1987:\n28).\nThe proof of Gleason\u2019s theorem is notoriously intricate.  It is\nnotable, however, that this corollary of Gleason\u2019s theorem can be\nobtained more directly via means much more elementary than those\nemployed in Gleason\u2019s proof.  Bell (1982: 994, 1987: 164) credits\nJ. M. Jauch with drawing his attention (in 1963) to Gleason\u2019s theorem,\nand with pointing out that it implies the strengthening of von\nNeumann\u2019s result, with the additivity requirement only for commuting\nobservables.  Bell then went on to prove the result in an elementary\nway, without use of Gleason\u2019s proof (Bell 1966).  Unknown to Bell,\nSpecker had already arrived at this result, alluded to (but not\npresented) in Specker (1960), as ein elementargeometrisches\nArgument.[5]\nThe argument was presented in Kochen and Specker (1967).  Bell\u2019s proof\nand the Kochen-Specker proof utilize similar constructions in\n3-dimensional Hilbert space, though they differ in their details.\nKochen and Specker go on to explicitly construct a finite set of\nprojections that cannot be assigned values subject to the constraint\nthat the additivity requirement (3) hold when A\nand B commute.  Though Bell does not do so, one can readily\nobtain from Bell\u2019s construction also a finite set of observables that\ncannot be assigned values subject to the additivity constraint for\ncommuting observables (see Mermin 1993).\n\n\nAfter having offered his variant of the argument against HV theories\nfrom Gleason\u2019s theorem, Bell proceeds to criticise it. His\nstrategy parallels the one against von Neumann. Bell points\nout that his own Gleason-type argument against arbitrary closeness of\ntwo opposite-valued points presupposes non-trivial relations between\nvalues of non-commuting observables, which are only justified given\nan assumption of noncontextuality (NC). He proposes as an analysis of\nwhat went wrong that his own argument \u201ctacitly assumed that\nmeasurement of an observable must yield the same value independently\nof what other measurements may be made simultaneously\u201d (1966: 9). In\nopposition to von Neumann, the Gleason-type argument derives\nrestrictions on value assignments like (3) only for sets of\ncompatible observables; but still one and the same observable can be\na member of different commuting sets, and it is essential to the\narguments that the observable gets assigned the same value in both\nsets, i.e. that the value assignment is not sensitive to a context.\n3. Statement and Proof of the KS Theorem\n3.1 Statement of the KS Theorem\n\n\nAn explicit statement of the KS theorem runs thus: \nLet H be a Hilbert space of QM state vectors of\n dimension x \u2265 3. There is a set M of observables on H, \ncontaining y elements, such that the following two assumptions are\ncontradictory: \n\n\n\n(KS1) All y members of M simultaneously have values,\ni.e.  are unambiguously mapped onto real numbers (designated, for\nobservables A, B, C, \u2026, by\nv(A), v(B),\nv(C), \u2026).\n\n\n(KS2) Values of all observables in M conform to the following\nconstraints:\n(a) If A, B, C are all\ncompatible and C = A+B, then\nv(C) =\nv(A)+v(B);\n\n\n\n(b) if A, B, C are all compatible and\nC = A\u00b7B, then v(C)\n= v(A)\u00b7v(B).\n\n\n\n\nAssumption KS1 of the theorem obviously is an equivalent of VD.\nAssumptions KS2 (a) and (b) are called the Sum Rule and the\nProduct Rule, respectively, in the literature. (The reader\nshould again note that, in opposition to von Neumann\u2019s implicit\npremise, these rules non-trivially relate the values of\ncompatible observables only.) Both are consequences of a\ndeeper principle called the functional composition principle (FUNC),\nwhich in turn is a consequence of (among other assumptions) NC. The\nconnection between NC, FUNC, Sum Rule and Product Rule will be made\nexplicit in Section 4.\n\nThe KS Theorem claims the existence of a set M with a certain property \n(i.e. being such that KS1 and KS2 are \ncontradictory)[6] \nand the proof proceeds by explicitly presenting such a set, for different\nchoices of x and y.  In the original KS proof x=3\nand y=117. More\nrecently proofs involving less observables have been given by (among\nmany others) Peres (1991, 1995) for x=3 and y=33, by\nKernaghan (1994) for x=4 and y=20 and by Cabello\net al. (1996) for x=4 and y=18. The KS\nproof is notoriously complex, and we will only sketch it in Section\n3.4. The Peres proof establishes the KS result in full strength, with\ngreat simplicity, and, moreover, in an intuitively accessible way,\nsince it operates in three dimensions; we refer the reader to Peres\n(1995: 197\u201399). The proofs by Kernaghan and Cabello et\nal. each establish a contradiction in four dimensions. These are\nweaker results, of course, than the KS theorem (since every\ncontradiction in 3 dimensions is also a contradiction in higher\ndimensions, but not conversely). However, these other proofs are very\nsimple and instructive. Moreover, it can be shown (Pavi\u010di\u0107\net al. 2005) that y=18 is the lowest number for\nwhich the KS theorem holds true, so we start by presenting the proof\nof Cabello and his co-workers in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.5,\nwe explain an argument by Clifton (1993) where x=3 and\ny=8 and an additional statistical assumption yields an easy\nand instructive KS argument.\n3.2 A Quick KS Argument in Four Dimensions (Cabello et al.)\n\n\nA particularly easy KS argument proceeds in a four-dimensional Hilbert\nspace H4. We will use the following, which will be proved\nin the next section: \n\n\n(1) From KS2 we can derive a constraint on value assignments to\nprojection operators, namely that for every set of projection\noperators P1, P2,\nP3, P4, corresponding to the\nfour distinct eigenvalues q1,\nq2, q3, q4\nof an observable Q on H4 the following holds:\n(VC1\u2032)\u00a0\u00a0\nv(P1) +\nv(P2) +\nv(P3) +\nv(P4) = 1, where\nv(Pi) = 1 or 0, for i =\n1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\n((VC1\u2032) is a variant of (VC1) which\nwe prove explicitly in the next section.) This means in effect that\nof every set of four orthogonal rays in H4 exactly one is assigned\nthe number 1, the others 0.\n\n\n(2) Although the Hilbert space mentioned in the theorem, in order to\nbe suited for QM, must be complex, it is enough, in order to\nshow the inconsistency of claims KS1 and KS2, to consider a\nreal Hilbert space of the same dimension. So, instead of H4\nwe consider a real Hilbert space R4 and translate VC1\u2032 into the\nrequirement: Of every set of orthogonal rays in R4, exactly one is\nassigned the number 1 and the others 0. As usual in the literature, we\ntranslate all this into the following colouring problem: Of every\nset of orthogonal rays in R4 exactly one must be coloured white, the\nothers black. This, however, is impossible, as is shown\nimmediately by the following table (Cabello et al. 1996):\n\n\n0,0,0,1\n0,0,0,1\n1,\u22121,1,\u22121\n1,\u22121,1,\u22121\n0,0,1,0\n1,\u22121,\u22121,1\n1,1,\u22121,1\n1,1,\u22121,1\n1,1,1,\u22121\n\n\n0,0,1,0\n0,1,0,0\n1,\u22121,\u22121,1\n1,1,1,1,\n0,1,0,0\n1,1,1,1\n1,1,1,\u22121\n\u22121,1,1,1\n\u22121,1,1,1\n\n\n1,1,0,0\n1,0,1,0\n1,1,0,0\n1,0,\u22121,0\n1,0,0,1\n1,0,0,\u22121\n1,\u22121,0,0\n1,0,1,0\n1,0,0,1\n\n\n1,\u22121,0,0\n1,0,\u22121,0\n0,0,1,1\n0,1,0,\u22121\n1,0,0,\u22121\n0,1,\u22121,0\n0,0,1,1\n0,1,0,\u22121\n0,1,\u22121,0\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 x 9 = 36 entries in this table. These entries are taken\nfrom a set of 18 rays and every ray appears twice.  It is easy\nto verify that every column in the table represents a set of four\northogonal rays.  Since there are 9 columns, we must end up\nwith an odd number of the table\u2019s entries coloured\nwhite. However, since every ray appears twice any time we colour one\nof them white, we commit ourselves to colouring an even number of the\nentries white. It follows that the total number of table entries\ncoloured white must be even, not odd. Thus, a colouring of\nthese 18 rays in accordance with VC1\u2032 is impossible.  (Note for\nfuture reference that the first part of the argument \u2014 the\nargument for \u2018odd\u2019 \u2014 uses only VC1\u2032, while\nthe second \u2014 the argument for \u2018even\u2019 \u2014 relies\nessentially on NC, by assuming that occurrences of the same ray in\ndifferent columns are assigned the same number!)\n3.3 The Original KS Argument. Technical Preliminaries.\n\n\nThe original KS proof operates on a three-dimensional complex Hilbert\nspace H3. It requires two things: (1) sets of triples of\nrays which are orthogonal in H3; (2) a constraint to the\neffect that of every orthogonal triple one ray gets assigned the\nnumber 1, the two others 0.  Both can be achieved as follows: \n\n\nWe consider an arbitrary operator Q on H3 with\nthree distinct eigenvalues q1,\nq2, q3, its eigenvectors\n|q1>, |q2>,\n|q3>, and projection operators\nP1, P2, P3\nprojecting on the rays spanned by these vectors. Now,\nP1, P2, P3\nare themselves observables (namely, Pi is a\n\u2018yes-no observable\u2019 corresponding to the question\n\u2018Does the system have value qi for\nQ?\u2019). Moreover, P1, P2,\nP3 are mutually compatible, so we can apply the\nSum Rule and Product Rule, and thereby derive a constraint on the\nassignment of values\n (Proof):\n(VC1)\u00a0\u00a0 v(P1) +\nv(P2) + \nv(P3) = 1, where\nv(Pi) = 1 or 0,  for i = 1,\n2, 3.\n\n\nThe arbitrary choice of an observable Q defines new\nobservables P1, P2,\nP3 which, in turn, select rays in\nH3. So, to impose that observables P1,\nP2, P3 all have values means\nto assign numbers to rays in H3, and VC1, in particular,\nmeans that of an arbitrary triple of orthogonal rays, specified by\nchoice of an arbitrary Q (briefly: an orthogonal triple in\nH3), exactly one of its rays is assigned 1, the others 0.\nNow, if we introduce different incompatible observables Q,\nQ\u2032, Q\u2033, \u2026 these observables\nselect different orthogonal triples in H3. Assumption (1)\nof the KS theorem (which, effectively, is VD) now tells us that every\none of these triples has three values, and VC1 tells us that these\nvalues must be for every triple, exactly {1, 0, 0}. What KS now shows\nis that, for a specific finite set of orthogonal triples in\nH3, an assignment of numbers {1, 0, 0} to every\none of them (matching in common rays) is impossible.  Further\nreflection yields that while H3 is complex, it is in fact\nenough to consider a real three-dimensional Hilbert space\nR3. For we can show that if an assignment of values\naccording to VC1 is possible on H3, then it is possible on\nR3.  Contrapositively, if the assignment is impossible on\nR3, then it is impossible on H3. So we can\nfulfill the conditions necessary to get the KS proof started and at\nthe same time reduce the problem to one on R3.  Now, the\nequivalent in R3 of an arbitrary orthogonal triple in\nH3, is, again, an arbitrary triple of orthogonal rays\n(briefly: an orthogonal triple in R3). So, if KS want to\nshow that, for a specific set of n orthogonal triples in\nH3 (where n is a natural number), an assignment of\nnumbers {1, 0, 0} to every one of them is impossible, it is enough for\nthem to show that, for a specific set of n orthogonal triples\nin R3, an assignment of numbers {1, 0, 0}\nto every one of them is impossible. And this is exactly what\nthey do.\n\n\nIt should be stressed that at this point there is no direct connection\nbetween R3 and physical space. KS wish to show that for an\narbitrary QM system requiring a representation in a Hilbert space of\nat least three dimensions, the ascription of values in conjunction\nwith condition (KS2) (Sum Rule and Product Rule) is impossible, and in\norder to do this it is sufficient to consider the space\nR3. This space R3, however, does not represent\nphysical space for the quantum system at issue. In particular,\northogonality in R3 is not to be confused with\northogonality in physical space. This becomes obvious if we move to an\nexample of a QM system sitting in physical space and at the same time\nrequiring a QM representation in H3, e.g. the spin degree\nof freedom of a one-particle spin-1 system.  Given an arbitrary\ndirection \u03b1 in physical space and an operator\n S\u03b1\n representing the observable of a spin component in direction\n \u03b1,\n H3 is spanned by the eigenvectors of\n S\u03b1,\n namely\n |S\u03b1=1>, \n |S\u03b1=0>,\n |S\u03b1=\u22121>,\n which are mutually orthogonal in H3. The fact that these three\nvectors corresponding to three possible results of measurement in one\nspatial direction are mutually orthogonal illustrates the different\nsenses of orthogonality in H3 and in physical space. (The reason\nlies, of course, in the structure of QM, which represents different\nvalues of an observable by different directions in H3.) \n\n\nKS themselves, in the abstract, proceed in exactly the same way, but\nthey illustrate with an example that does establish a direct\nconnection with physical space. It is important to see this\nconnection, but also to be clear that it is produced by KS\u2019s\nexample and is not inherent in their mathematical result. KS propose\nto consider a one-particle spin-1 system and the measurement of the\nsquared components of orthogonal directions of spin in physical space\nSx2,\nSy2,\nSz2, which are compatible (while\nSx, \nSy,\nSz themselves are\n not).[7]\n Measurement of a squared component of spin determines only its absolute\nvalue. Here, they derive a slightly\ndifferent constraint on value assignments, again using the Sum Rule\nand the Product Rule\n (Proof):\n(VC2)\u00a0\u00a0\nv(Sx2) +\nv(Sy2) +\nv(Sz2) = 2, where\nv(S\u03b12)\n= 1 or 0,  for\n \u03b1 = x, y,\nz.\n\n\nNow, since Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 are compatible, there is an\nobservable O such that Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 are all functions of O. So, the\nchoice of an arbitrary such O fixes Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 and, since the latter can be\ndirectly associated with mutually orthogonal rays in H3, again fixes\nthe choice of an orthogonal triple in H3. The resulting problem here\nis to assign numbers {1, 1, 0} to an orthogonal triple in H3\nspecified by the choice of O or, more directly, of\nSx2,\nSy2,\nSz2. This is, of course, the\nmirror-image of our previous problem of assigning numbers {1, 0, 0}\nto such a triple, and we need not consider it separately.\n\n\nHowever, the choice of a specific O that selects observables\nSx2, Sy2,\nSz2 at the same time selects three\northogonal rays in physical space, namely by fixing a coordinate\nsystem \u00b1x, \u00b1y, \u00b1z\n(which defines along which orthogonal rays the squared spin components\nare to be measured) in physical space. So now, by choice of\nan observable O, there is a direct connection of directions\nin space with directions in H3: orthogonality in\nH3 now does correspond to orthogonality in\nphysical space. The same holds for R3, if, in order to give\nan argument for H3, we consider\nR3. Orthogonality in R3 now corresponds to\northogonality in physical space. It is important to notice that this\ncorrespondence is not necessary to give the argument, even if we\ninsist that the pure mathematical facts should be supplemented by a\nphysical interpretation \u2014 since we have, just before, seen an\nexample without any correspondence. The point is only that\nwe can devise an example such that there is a\ncorrespondence. In particular, we can now follow the proof in\nR3 and all along imagine a system sitting in physical\nspace, namely a spin-1 particle, returning three values upon\nmeasurement of three physical magnitudes, associated directly with\northogonal directions in physical space, namely\nv(Sx2),\nv(Sy2),\nv(Sz2), for arbitrary choices\nof x, y, z. The KS proof then shows that\nit is impossible (given its premises, of course) to assign to the\nspin-1 particle values for all these arbitrary choices. That is, the\nKS argument shows that (given the premises) a spin 1 particle cannot\npossess all the properties at once which it displays in different\nmeasurement arrangements.\n\n\nThree further features which have become customary in KS arguments\nneed to be mentioned:\n\n\n(1) Obviously, we can unambiguously specify any ray in R3 through the\norigin by just giving one point contained in it. KS thus identify\nrays with points on the unit sphere E. KS do not need to refer to\nconcrete coordinates of a certain point, since their argument is\n\u2018coordinate-free\u2019. We will, however, for illustration\nsometimes mention concrete points and then (a) use Cartesian\ncoordinates to check orthogonality relations and (b) specify rays by\npoints not lying on E. (Thus, e.g., the triple of points (0, 0, 1),\n(4, 1, 0), (1, \u20134, 0) is used to specify a triple of orthogonal\nrays.) Both usages conform with the recent literature (see e.g. Peres\n(1991) and Clifton (1993)).\n\n\n(2) We translate the constraints (VC1) and (VC2) on value ascriptions\ninto constraints for colouring the points. We can, operating under\n(VC1) colour the points white (for \u201c1\u201d) and black (for\n\u201c0\u201d), or, operating under (VC2) colour the points white\n(for \u201c0\u201d) and black (for \u201c1\u201d). In either case\nthe constraints translate into the same colouring problem.\n\n\n(3) KS illustrate orthogonality relations of rays by graphs which\nhave come to be called KS diagrams. In such a diagram each\nray (or point specifying a ray) is represented by a vertex. Vertices\njoined by a straight line represent orthogonal rays. The colouring\nproblem then translates into the problem of colouring the vertices of\nthe diagram white or black such that joined vertices cannot be both\nwhite and triangles have exactly one white vertex.\n3.4 The Original KS Argument. Sketch of the Proof.\n\n\nKS proceed in two steps. \n\n\n(1) In the first (and decisive) step they show that two rays with\nopposite colours cannot be arbitrarily close. They first show that the\ndiagram\n \u03931\n depicted in Fig. 1 (where for the time being we ignore the colours \nspecified in the figure) can be constructed, only if \na0 and a9 are separated by an angle\n \u03b8\n with 0\n \u2264\n \u03b8\n \u2264\n sin\u22121(1/3)\n (Proof).\n\n\nFigure 1: Ten-point KS graph\n \u03931 with inconsistent colouring.\n\n\nConsider now (for a reductio ad absurdum) that a0 and\na9 have different colours. We arbitrarily colour\na0 white and a9 black. The colouring\nconstraints then force us to colour the rest of the diagram as is\ndone in Fig. 1, but this requires that a5 and a6\nare orthogonal and both white \u2014 which is forbidden. Hence, two\npoints closer than sin\u22121(1/3) cannot have different\ncolours. Contrapositively, two points of different colour cannot be\ncloser than sin\u22121(1/3).\n\n\n(2) KS now construct another quite complicated KS diagram\n \u03932\n in the following way. They consider a realization of\n \u03931\n for an angle\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n <\nsin\u22121(1/3). Now they choose three orthogonal points\np0, q0, r0 and space interlocking\ncopies of\n \u03931\n between them such that every instance of point a9 of one\n copy of\n \u03931\n is identified with the instance of a0 of the next\ncopy. In this way five interlocking copies of\n \u03931\n are spaced between p0 and q0 and all five\ninstances of a8 are identified with r0\n(likewise five such interlocking copies are spaced between q0 and \nr0, identifying all copies of a8 with p0, \nand between p0 and r0, identifying all copies of \na8 with q0). That\n \u03932\n is constructible is borne out directly by the construction\nitself. Spacing out five copies of \u03931 with angles\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n between instances of a0\n will space out an angle of 5x18\u00b0 = 90\u00b0 which is exactly what\nis required. Moreover, wandering from one copy of\n \u03931\n to the next between, say, p0 and q0 is\nequivalent to a rotation by 18\u00b0 of the copy about the axis through\nthe origin and r0, which evidently conserves the\northogonality between the points a0 and a9 of\nthe copy and r0.\n\n\nFigure 2: 117-point KS graph\n \u03932\n\n(From Kochen and Specker 1967, 69; by permission of the\nIndiana University Mathematics Journal)\n\n\nHowever, although\n \u03932 is\nconstructible it is not consistently colourable. From the\nfirst step we know that a copy of\n \u03931 with\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n requires that points a0 and a9 have equal\ncolour.  Now, since a9 in one copy of\n \u03931\n is identical to a0 in the next copy, a9 in the\nsecond copy must have the same colour as a0 in the\nfirst. Indeed, by repetition of this argument all instances of\na0 must have the same colour. Now, p0,\nq0, r0 are identified with points\na0, so they must be either all white or all black \u2014 both\nof which are inconsistent with the colouring constraint that exactly\none of them be white.\n\n\nIf from the 15 copies of\n \u03931\n used in the process of constructing\n \u03932\n we subtract those points that were identified with each other, we\nend up with 117 different points. So, what KS have shown is that a set\nof 117 yes-no observables cannot consistently be assigned values in\naccordance with VC1 (or, equivalently, VC2).\n\n\nNote that in the construction of\n \u03931,\n i.e. the set of 10 points forming 22 interlocking triples, all\npoints except a9 appear in more than one triple. In\n \u03932 every\n point appears in a multiplicity of triples. It is here that the\nnoncontextuality premise is crucial to the argument: we assume that\nan arbitrary point keeps its value 1 or 0 as we move from one\northogonal triple to the next (i.e. from one maximal set of\ncompatible observables to another).\n3.5 A Statistical KS Argument in Three Dimensions (Clifton)\n\n\nRecall KS\u2019s first step, which\nestablishes that two points with opposite colour cannot be\narbitrarily close. It is this first step which carries the whole\nforce of the argument. Bell had established it in a different way and\nhad then argued that in a noncontextual HV interpretation points with\nopposite colour must be arbitrarily close. It is this first step\nthat Clifton exploits in an argument that combines Bell\u2019s and\nKS\u2019s ideas.\n\n\nFigure 3: 8-point KS-Clifton graph\n \u03933 with inconsistent colouring.\n\n\nConsider the KS diagram\n \u03933\nshown in Figure 3 which obviously is a part of KS\u2019s\n \u03931,\n but which has additional concrete assignments of eight points\nsatisfying the orthogonality relations (and thus proving directly\nthat\n \u03933\n is constructible). From our previous colouring constraints (joined\npoints are not both white and a triangle has exactly one white point)\nwe see immediately that\n \u03933\n is colourable only if the outermost points are not both white (which\nwould require, as shown in Fig. 3, that two joined points are white \u2014\ncontrary to the constraints). Moreover, we easily calculate the angle\nbetween the two outermost points to be\n cos\u22121(1/3).[8]\n So we conclude that if one wants to colour all eight points and\nwants to colour white one of the outer ones, then the other must be\nblack. Taking into account that we can insert a diagram between any\ntwo points in R3 which are separated by exactly the angle\ncos\u22121(1/3) and translating our problem back from a\ncolouring problem into KS\u2019s example (constraint VC2), we end\nwith a constraint\n VC2\u2032: \n(VC2\u2032)\u00a0\u00a0 If, for\na spin-1 system, a certain direction x of spin in space is\nassigned value 0, then any other direction\n x\u2032\n which lies away from x by an angle cos\u22121(1/3)\nmust be assigned value 1, or, in symbols: If\nv(Sx)=0, then\n v(Sx\u2032)=1.\n\n\n\nThe argument so far has made use of the original KS conditions KS1\nand KS2. We now assume, in addition, that any constraint on value\nassignments will show up in the measurement statistics. In\nparticular:\n(3) If prob[v(A)=a] = 1, and\nv(A)=a implies\nv(B)=b, then\nprob[v(B)=b] = 1.\n\n\nDespite the use of statistics, this reasoning crucially differs from\nvon Neumann\u2019s argument. Von Neumann had argued that algebraic\nrelations between values should transfer into the statistics of the\nmeasured values, therefore the QM constraints on these statistics\nshould have value constraints as their exact mirror images \u2014 which\nreasoning leads us to derive value constraints from statistical\nconstraints (for arbitrary observables). Here, on the contrary, we\nderive a value constraint independently from any statistical\nreasoning, and then conclude that this constraint should transfer\ninto the measurement\n statistics.[9]\n\n\nNow,\n VC2\u2032\n and the statistical condition (3) entail: If\nprob[v(Sx)=0]=1, then\nprob[v(Sx\u2032)=1]=1. This,\nhowever, contradicts the statistics derived from QM for a state where\nprob[v(Sx)=0] =\n1.[10] In fact,\nthere is a probability of 1/17 that\n v(Sx\u2032=0).\n So, in a long-run test 1/17 of the spin-1 particles will violate the\nconstraint.\n\n\nIf we accept\nClifton\u2019s statistical reasoning, we have an entirely valid KS\nargument establishing a contradiction between an HV interpretation of\nQM and the very predictions of QM. Clifton presents also a\nslightly more complex set of 13 observables yielding, along the same\nlines, a statistical contradiction of 1/3.\n\n\nClifton\u2019s argument uses 8 (or 13) observables, fixes a value of one of\nthem (Sx) and derives a HV prediction at\nvariance with a QM prediction for a second one\n(Sx\u2032). Hence, if a state can be\nproduced where the QM system definitely has\nvalue v(Sx)=0 the predictions\ncan be tested empirically. But fixing such a state experimentally is\nnot an easy matter. So Clifton\u2019s argument depends on a state that may\nbe difficult to produce or isolate. Recently, a construction of 13\nobservables has been found that allows for a state-independent\nstatistical argument (Yu and Oh 2012).\n4. The Functional Composition Principle\n\n\nThe key ingredients of the KS theorem are the constraints on value\nassignments spelled out in (2): the Sum Rule and Product Rule. They\ncan be derived from a more general principle, called the Functional\nComposition Principle\n (FUNC).[11]\n The principle trades on the mathematical fact that for a\nself-adjoint operator A operating on a\nHilbert space, and an arbitrary function f:\n R\u2192R\n(where R is the set of the real numbers), we can\ndefine f(A) and show that it also is a\nself-adjoint operator (hence, we write\nf(A)). If we further assume that to every\nself-adjoint operator there corresponds a QM observable, then the\nprinciple can be formulated thus:\nFUNC:\u00a0 Let A\nbe a self-adjoint operator associated with observable A, let f:\nR\n \u2192\n R be an\narbitrary function, such that f(A) is another\nself-adjoint operator, and let\n |\u03c6>\n be an arbitrary state; then f(A) is associated\nuniquely with an observable f(A) such that: \n\nv(f(A))|\u03c6>\n =\n f(v(A))|\u03c6>\n\n\n\n\n(We introduce the state superscript above to allow for a possible\ndependence of values on the particular quantum state the system is\nprepared in.) The Sum Rule and the Product Rule are straightforward\nconsequences of FUNC [Proof].\n FUNC itself is not derivable from the formalism\nof QM, but a statistical version of it (called STAT FUNC) is\n [Proof]:\nSTAT FUNC:\u00a0 Given A, f,\n |\u03c6>\n as defined in FUNC, then, for an\narbitrary real number b: \n\nprob[v(f(A))|\u03c6>=b]\n =\n prob[f(v(A))|\u03c6>=b]\n\n\n\nBut STAT FUNC cannot only be derived from the QM formalism; it also\nfollows from FUNC\n [Proof].\nThis can be seen as providing \u201ca plausibility argument for FUNC\u201d\n(Redhead 1987: 132): STAT FUNC is true, as a matter of the mathematics\nof QM. Now, if FUNC were true, we could derive STAT FUNC, and thus\nunderstand part of the mathematics of QM as a consequence of \n FUNC.[12]\n \n\nBut how can we derive FUNC itself, if not from STAT FUNC? It is a\ndirect consequence of STAT FUNC and three assumptions (two of which\nare familiar from the introduction):\nValue Realism (VR): If there is an\noperationally defined real number \u03b1, associated with a\nself-adjoint operator A and if, for a given\nstate, the statistical algorithm of QM for A\nyields a real number \u03b2 with\n \u03b2 = prob(v(A)=\u03b1), then\nthere exists an observable A with value \u03b1.\n\n\nValue Definiteness (VD): All observables defined\nfor a QM system have definite values at all times.\n\nNoncontextuality (NC): If a QM system possesses a\nproperty (value of an observable), then it does so independently of any\nmeasurement context.\n\n\n\nVR and NC require further explanation. First, we need to\nexplain the content of VR. The statistical algorithm of QM tells us how\nto calculate a probability from a given state, a given observable and\nits possible value. Here we understand it as a mere mathematical device without\nany physical interpretation: Given a Hilbert space vector, an operator\nand its eigenvalues, the algorithm tells us how to calculate new\nnumbers (which have the properties of probabilities). In addition, by\n\u2018operationally defined\u2019 we here simply mean \u2018made up\nfrom a number which we know to denote a real property\u2019. So, VR, in\neffect, says that, if we have a real property\n \u0393\n (value\n \u0393\n of an observable\nG), and we are able to construct from\n \u0393\na\n new number\n \u03b1\n and find an operator\nA such that\n \u03b1\nis\n an eigenvalue of A, then (we have fulfilled\neverything necessary to apply the statistical algorithm; thus)\nA represents an observable A and its value\n \u03b1\n is a real property. \n\n\nSecond, a failure of NC could be understood in two\nways. Either the value of an observable might be context-dependent,\nalthough the observable itself is not; or the value of an observable\nmight be context-dependent, because the observable itself is. In\neither case, the independence from context of an observable implies\nthat there is a correspondence of observables and operators. This\nimplication of NC is what we will use presently in the derivation of\nFUNC.  We will indeed assume that, if NC holds, this means that the\nobservable \u2014 and thereby also its value \u2014 is\nindependent of the measurement context, i.e. is independent of how it\nis measured. In particular, the independence from context of an\nobservable implies that there is a 1:1 correspondence of observables\nand operators. This implication of NC is what we will use presently\nin the derivation of FUNC. Conversely, failure of NC will be\nconstrued solely as failure of the 1:1 correspondence.\n\n\nFrom VR, VD, NC and STAT FUNC, we can derive FUNC as follows.\nConsider an arbitrary state of a system and an arbitrary observable\nQ.  By VD, Q possesses a value\nv(Q)=a. Thus, we can form the number\nf(v(Q))=b for an arbitrary\nfunction f. For this number, by STAT FUNC,\nprob[f(v(Q))=b] =\nprob[v(f(Q))=b].  Hence, we have,\nby transforming probabilities according to STAT FUNC, created a new\nself-adjoint operator f(Q), and associated it\nwith the two real numbers b and\nprob[f(v(Q))=b]. Thus, by VR,\nthere is an observable corresponding to f(Q)\nwith value b, hence\nf(v(Q))=v(f(Q)). By\nNC, that observable is unique, hence FUNC follows.\n5. Escaping the KS Argument\n\n\nThe previous section clarifies which possibilities the HV theorist has\nto escape the KS argument: denying one of the three premises which\ntogether entail FUNC (hence the Sum Rule and Product Rule). \n5.1 No General Value Definiteness\n\n\nVD, we recall, was the fundamental presupposition of a fully-fledged HV \ninterpretation. So, if, in order to escape a powerful argument\nagainst the possibility of HV interpretations, these interpretations\ndrop their fundamental premise, this seems not to make much\nsense. But some interpreters point out that, between holding that\nonly those observables which QM prescribes to have\n values[13]\n and holding that all of them have values, there is some leeway,\nnamely, to propose that a set of observables, different from the one \nprescribed in QM (but neither, in general, more than these, nor, of course, all) \nhave values. This option is called \u2018partial value definiteness.\u2019\nOne way to do this is to choose, once and for, a set of observables\nthat can be assigned definite values without running afoul of the KS\nTheorem.  The best-known example of this is the de Broglie-Bohm pilot\nwave theory, on which position and functions of position always have\ndefinite values.  Another approach is to let the set of definite\nobservables vary with the state; this is the approach taken by various\nmodal interpretations.  A variant on this approach is that of Bub\n(1997), on which some observable R is chosen to to be\nalways-definite; the set of definite observables is then expanded to\nthe maximal set that avoids a KS obstruction.\n\n\nThe rocks and shoals of modal interpretations are beyond the scope\nof this article (see the entry on\n modal interpretations).\n We just note that it is by no means clear how these interpretations\ncan manage to always pick out the right set of observables assumed to\nhave values. \u2018Right set\u2019 \nhere minimally means that observables we perceive as having values \n(i.e. those corresponding to the measurement apparatus\u2019s pointer position) \nmust always be included and must always reproduce the QM statistics. We\nalso mention two important results which cast doubt on the\nfeasibility of modal interpretations: First, it can be shown that\neither partial value definiteness collapses into total value\ndefiniteness (i.e., VD) or classical reasoning about physical\nproperties must be abandoned (Clifton 1995). Second, it is possible\nto derive KS theorems even in certain modal interpretations\n(Bacciagaluppi 1995, Clifton 1996).\n\n\nRecently it has been argued that the denial of VD is inconsistent with\nQM itself (Held 2008, 2012a, 2012b). The argument tries to show that\nVD is a consequence of the theory itself (QM \u2192 VD). If this is\nindeed the case we have \u2014 recalling that KS establish that QM\n& VD & NC implies a contradiction \u2014 an argument for the\nclaim that QM alone implies contextuality. Since, in that case, QM\nalso implies VD we get, all in all, an argument for the claim that QM\nmust be interpreted in terms of contextual hidden variables.\n5.2 Denial of Value Realism\n\n\nThe derivation of FUNC essentially consists in the construction of an\nobservable (i.e. f(Q)) via an operator (i.e.,\nf(Q)) from the probability distribution of a\nvariable (i.e. f(v(Q)) which number in turn\nis constructed from another variable,\n(i.e. v(Q)). Now, instead of denying that\nv(Q) exists in all cases (as the first option (5.1)\nwould have it), we can reject that the existence of a number \u03b1\nand the construction of f(Q) automatically\nlead to an observable, i.e. we reject VR. This amounts to rejecting\nthat for every self-adjoint operator, there is a well-defined\nobservable.\n\n\nNow, in order to formulate VR we had to give a reduced reading\nto the statistical algorithm, i.e. that it is a mere mathematical\ndevice for calculating numbers from vectors, operators and numbers.\nThis reading is very artificial and presupposes that a minimal interpretive\napparatus required to make physical sense of some operators (like\nQ) can be withheld for others (like\nf(Q)).\n\n\nMoreover, it seems entirely implausible to assume that some operators\n\u2014 sums and products of operators that are associated with\nwell-defined observables \u2014 are themselves not associated with\nwell-defined observables, even if they mathematically inherit exact\nvalues from their summands or factors. Put in a crude example, this\nwould amount to saying that to ask for a system\u2019s energy is a\nwell-defined question, while to ask for the square of the system\u2019s\nenergy is not, even if, from our answer to the first question and\ntrivial mathematics, we have a well-defined answer at hand. There\nseems no good a priori reason to justify this restriction. So, to make\nrejecting VR plausible at all, an additional proposal is made: It is\ncrucial to the KS argument that one and the same operator is\nconstructed from different maximal ones which are incompatible:\nf(Q) is identical to\ng(P), where PQ \u2212\nQP \u2260 0. We now assume that only the\nconstruction of f(Q) via Q, but not\nthe one via P, leads to a well-defined observable in a\ncertain\n context.[14]\n\n\nThis move however, automatically makes some observables\ncontext-sensitive. So, this way of motivating the denial of VR\namounts to a kind of contextualism, which we might come by cheaper,\nby directly rejecting NC, and without any tampering with the\nstatistical algorithm.  (This fact explains why we did not mention\ndenial of VR as a separate option in the introduction.).\n5.3 Contextuality\n\n\nFinally, we might accept VD and VR, but deny that our construction of\nan observable f(Q) is unambiguous. Thus, though\nf(Q) and g(P) are\nmathematically identical, we could assume that they correspond to\ndifferent observables, arguing that an actual determination of\nv(f(Q)) must proceed via measuring\nQ, but the determination of\nv(g(P)) involves measuring P which\nis incompatible with Q. Since\nv(f(Q)) and\nv(g(P)) are thus outcomes of different\nmeasurement situations, there is no reason to assume that\nv(f(Q)) =\nv(g(P)). This way to block the KS proof\ncomes to understanding f(Q) and\ng(P) as different observables (because of\nsensitivity to context), thus it amounts to rejecting NC. There are\nmainly two ways, in the literature, to further motivate this step.\nAccordingly, there are two important brands of contextuality to be\ndiscussed \u2014 causal and ontological contextuality.\n\n\nThe KS argument has been presented for possessed values of a QM system\n\u2014 independently of considerations about measurement. Indeed, in\nthe argument measurement was mentioned only once and in the negative\n\u2014 in NC. However, since now we consider the rejection of NC, we\nmust also take into account measurement and its complications. For\nthat purpose it is good to explicate yet another principle that\nmanifests our innocuous realism (see the introduction above), i.e. a\nprinciple of faithful measurement:\n\nFaithful Measurement (FM): QM measurement of an\nobservable faithfully delivers the value which that observable had\nimmediately prior to the measurement interaction.\n\nFM is also an extremely plausible presupposition of natural science,\nin general. (Note that FM entails VD, hence we could have given a KS\nargument for possible measurement results, using FM). Consider now the\nmotivation, for the HV proponent, to reject NC. Obviously, the aim is\nto save other presuppositions, especially VD. Now, VD and NC are\nindependent realist convictions, but NC and FM are not quite so\nindependent. Indeed, we will see that rejection of NC entails the\nrejection of FM in one version of contextuality, and strongly suggests\nit in the other. (This makes more precise the somewhat cryptic remark\nfrom the introduction that it is not obvious what an interpretation\nendorsing the realist principle VD, but rejecting the realist\nprinciple NC, should look like. Such an interpretation would have to\nviolate a third realist principle, i.e. FM.)\nCausal Contextuality\n\n\nA property (value of an observable) might be causally context-dependent in the\nsense that it is causally sensitive to how it is measured. The basic\nidea is that the observed value comes about as the effect of the\nsystem-apparatus interaction. Hence, measuring a system via\ninteraction with a P-measuring apparatus might yield a value\nv(g(P)), measuring the same system via\ninteraction with a Q-measuring apparatus a different value\nv(f(Q)), although both observables are\nrepresented by the same operator f(Q) =\ng(P). The difference in values is explained in\nterms of a context-dependence of the observables: The latter are\ncontext-dependent, since the different ways to physically realize them\ncausally influence the system in different ways and thereby change the\nobserved values.\n\n\nIf an interpreter wanted to defend causal contextuality, this would\nentail abandoning FM, at least for observables of the type\nf(Q) (non-maximal observables): Since their values\ncausally depend on the presence of certain measurement arrangements,\nthese arrangements are causally necessary for the values to come\nabout, thus the values cannot be present before the system-apparatus\ninteraction, and FM is violated.  As an advantage of causal\ncontextualism the following might be pointed out. It does not imply\nthat the ontological status of the physical properties involved must\nchange, i.e. does not imply that they become relational. If the\nproperty in an object is brought about via interaction with another\none, it can still be one which the object has for itself after the\ninteraction. However, the idea of causal contextuality is sometimes\ndiscussed critically, since there is reason to think that it may be\nempirically inadequate (see Shimony 1984, Stairs 1992).\nOntological Contextuality\n\n\nA property (value of an observable) might be ontologically\ncontext-dependent in the sense that in order for it to be well-defined\nthe specification of the observable it \u2018comes from\u2019 is\nnecessary. Thus, in order to construct a well-defined observable from\noperator\nf(Q) = g(P), we need\nto know whether it is physically realized via observable P or\nobservable Q. This way out of the KS problem, was first noted\n(but not advocated) by van Fraassen (1973). There are, then, as many\nobservables and kinds of physical properties for an operator\nf(Q) as there are ways to construct\nf(Q) from maximal operators. Without further\nexplanation, however, this idea just amounts to an ad hoc\nproliferation of physical magnitudes. A defender of ontological\ncontextuality certainly owes us a more explicit story about the\ndependence of observable f(Q) on observable\nQ. Two possibilities come to mind:\n\n\n(a) We might think that v(f(Q)) just is not\na self-sustained physical property, but one which ontologically\ndepends on the presence of another property\nv(Q). (Recall that in the proof of FUNC\nv(f(Q)) is constructed from\nv(Q).)  But, since the position does not reject\nquestions about values of f(Q) in a\nP-measurement situation as illegitimate (because it does not\ntrade on a notion of an observable being well-defined in one context\nonly!), this seems to lead to new and pressing questions, to say the\nleast. As an attempt to defend a contextualist hidden\nvariables interpretation, this position must concede that not\nonly does the system have, in the Q-measurement situation, a\nvalue v(Q), but also, in a P-measurement\nsituation, it has a value v\u2032(Q), although\nperhaps v\u2032(Q) \u2260\nv(Q). Now, questions for values of\nf(Q) in this situation at least are legitimate. Does\nv\u2032(Q) imply another\nv\u2032(f(Q)) \u2260\nv(f(Q))? Or does\nv\u2032(Q), in opposition to\nv(Q), not lead to a value of f(Q),\nat all? Neither option seems plausible, for could we not, just by\nswitching for a certain prepared system between a P- and\nQ-measurement situation either switch\nv(f(Q)) in and out of existence or switch\nbetween v(f(Q)) and\nv\u2032(f(Q))?  (b) We might think that,\nin order for f(Q) to be well-defined, one\nmeasurement arrangement rather than the other is necessary. The idea\nis strongly reminiscent of Bohr\u2019s 1935 argument against EPR, and\nindeed may be viewed as the appropriate extension of Bohr\u2019s views on\nQM to the modern HV discussion (see Held 1998, ch.7). In this version\nof ontological contextualism the property\nv(f(Q)), rather than depending on the\npresence of another property v(Q), is dependent on\nthe presence of a Q-measuring apparatus. This amounts to a\nholistic position: For some properties it only makes sense to speak of\nthem as pertaining to the system, if that system is part of a certain\nsystem-apparatus whole. Here, the question for values of\nf(Q) in a P-measurement situation does\nbecome illegitimate, since f(Q)\u2019s being well-defined\nis tied to a Q-measurement situation.  But again further\nclarification is required. Does the position hold that, in opposition\nto f(Q), Q itself is well-defined in a\nP-measurement situation? If it does not, Q can\nhardly have a value (since not being well-defined was the reason to\ndeny f(Q) a value), which means that we are not\nconsidering an HV interpretation of the given type any longer, and\nthat there is no need to block the KS argument at all. If it does,\nwhat explains that, in the P-measurement situation,\nQ remains well-defined, but f(Q) loses this\nstatus?\n\n\nWhat becomes of FM in both versions of ontological contextualism?\nWell, if we remain agnostic about how the position could be made\nplausible, we can save FM, while, if we choose version (a) or (b) to\nmake it plausible, we lose it. Consider first an agnostic denial of\nNC.  FM says that every QM observable is faithfully\nmeasured. Now, contextualism splits an operator which can be\nconstructed from two different noncommuting operators into two\nobservables, and ontological contextualism does not try to give us a\ncausal story which would ruin the causal independence of the measured\nvalue from the measurement interaction embodied in FM. We simply\nintroduce a more fine-grained conception of observables, but can still impose FM for\nthese new contextual observables.\n\n\nHowever, the concrete versions of ontological contextualism, by\nattempting to motivate the contextual feature, ruin FM. Version (a)\nallows f(Q) to be switched \u2018on and off\u2019\nor to switch between different values upon the change between\nP- and Q-measurement situations \u2014 which is a\nflagrant violation of FM. Version (b) fares no better. It introduces\nthe ontological dependence on the measuring arrangement. It is hard to\nsee what else this should be, but the same causal dependence pushed to\na higher, \u2018ontological\u2019 key.  Again, could we not, just by\nflipping back and forth the measurement arrangement, change back and\nforth whether f(Q) is well-defined, thus flip\nv(f(Q)) in and out of existence?\n\n\nFinally, we note that both types of ontological contextualism, in\nopposition to the causal version, do entail that system\nproperties which we earlier thought to be intrinsic become\nrelational in the sense that a system can only have these properties\neither if it has certain others, or if it is related to a certain\nmeasurement arrangement.\n6. The Question of Empirical Testing\n\n\nFamously, the violation of Bell\u2019s inequalities, prescribed by\nQM, has been confirmed experimentally. Is something similar possible\nfor the KS theorem? We should distinguish three questions: (1) Is it\npossible to realize the experiment proposed by KS as a motivation of\ntheir theorem?  (2) Is it possible to test the principles leading to\nthe theorem: the Sum Rule and Product Rule, FUNC, or NC? (3) Is it\npossible to test the theorem itself?\n\n\n(1) KS themselves describe a concrete experimental arrangement to\nmeasure Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 on a one-particle spin-1 system as\nfunctions of one maximal observable.  An orthohelium atom in the\nlowest triplet state is placed in a small electric field E of rhombic\nsymmetry. The three observables in question then can be measured as\nfunctions of one single observable, the perturbation Hamiltonian\nHs. Hs, by the geometry of E, has three\ndistinct possible values, measurement of which reveals which two\nof Sx2,\nSy2,\nSz2 have value 1 and which one has value\n0 (see Kochen and Specker 1967: 72/311). This is, of course, a\nproposal to realize an experiment exemplifying our above value\nconstraint (VC2). Could we also realize a (VC1) experiment,\ni.e. measure a set of commuting projectors projecting on eigenstates\nof one maximal observable? Peres (1995: 200) answers the question in\nthe affirmative, discusses such an experiment, and refers to Swift\nand Wright (1980) for details about the technical feasibility. Kochen\nand Specker\u2019s experimental proposal has, however, not been further\npursued, because it does not provide a direct test of NC. Obviously, a\nmeasurement of HS measures one orthogonal triple only. An\nHV proponent might well assume that the hidden state changes from one\nmeasurement of HS to the next (even if we prepare the same\nQM state again) and thus maintain NC. \n\n\n(2) In conjunction with manifestations of FUNC, i.e. the Sum Rule and\nthe Product Rule, QM yields constraints like VC1 or VC2 that\ncontradict VD. So, providing concrete physical examples that could,\ngiven the Sum Rule and the Product Rule, instantiate VC1 or VC2 as\njust outlined is not enough. We must ask whether these rules\nthemselves can be empirically supported. There was considerable\ndiscussion of this question in the early 80s \u2014 explicitly about\nwhether the Sum Rule is empirically testable \u2014 and there was\ngeneral agreement that it is\n not.[15]\n\n\nThe reason is the following. Recall that the derivation of FUNC\nestablished uniqueness of the new observable f(Q)\nonly in its final step (via NC). It is this uniqueness which\nguarantees that one operator represents exactly one observable so that\nobservables (and thereby their values) in different contexts can be\nequated. This allows one to establish indirect connections between\ndifferent incompatible observables. Without this final step, FUNC must\nbe viewed as holding relative to different contexts, the connection is\nbroken and FUNC is restricted to one set of observables which are all\nmutually compatible.  Then indeed FUNC, the Sum Rule and the Product\nRule become trivial, and empirical testing in these cases would be a\npointless \n question.[16]\n It is NC that does all the work and deserves to be tested via\nchecking whether for incompatible P, Q such that\nf(Q)=g(P) it is true that\nv(f(Q))=v(g(P)). However,\nthough QM and a noncontextual HV theory contradict each other for a\nsingle system, this contradiction involves incompatible observables\nand, thus, is untestable (as we have just seen from Kochen and\nSpecker\u2019s own proposal). Physicists have, however, made ingenious\nproposals for overcoming this obstacle. It is well-known that the\nconsideration of two-particle systems and products of spin components\nleads to very simple KS-type proofs (Mermin 1990b). Cabello and\nGarc\u00eca-Alcaine (1998) have shown that for such systems QM and a\nnoncontextual HV theory make different predictions for every single\ncase. Their reasoning makes no reference to locality considerations,\nbut as it requires two particles, such considerations might creep\nin. Simon et al. (2000), have mapped the\nCabello/Garc\u00eca-Alcaine scheme onto a combination of position and spin\nobservables for a single particle. Their experiment has been carried\nout and has confirmed the QM predictions (Huang et al. 2003; see also more recently Huang et al. 2013). All the\nmentioned authors consider their experimental proposals to be empirical\nrefutations of NC, but this has been doubted (Barrett and Kent 2004),\nfor reasons considered in the next paragraph.\n\n\n(3) The KS theorem, by its mathematical nature, is not empirically\ntestable. However, we could, along the lines of the previous\nparagraphs, try to measure a subset of a suitable KS-uncolourable\nset. Especially, it should be possible to produce cases along the\nlines of Clifton\u2019s example (3.5) where QM and a noncontextual HV\ntheory make measurably different predictions. It seems as if such\ncases could provide empirical tests of whether Nature is contextual\n(though not whether such contextuality is of the causal or ontological\ntype).(For a recent version of such an approach see Tang and Yu 2017.) \nFrom the 1980s on, it has been argued that such testing is\nimpossible. The KS theorem, it was claimed, leaves enough loopholes for\na HV theory at variance with QM, but able to reproduce the theory\u2019s\nempirical predictions. Pitowsky (1983, 1985) argued that it is\npossible to restrict attention to a subset of directions in\nR3 which are colourable. His argument, however, relies on a\nnon-standard version of probability theory that is regarded as\nphysically implausible. Meyer (1999) has exploited the\nmathematical fact that a set DM of directions in\nR3 approximating the KS-set arbitrarily closely, but\nwith rational coordinates is KS-colourable. Meyer argues that\nreal measurements have finite precision and thus can never distinguish\nbetween a direction in R3 and its approximation from\nDM. Kent (1999) has generalized the result for all Hilbert\nspaces, and Clifton and Kent (2000) have shown that also a set of\ndirections DCK such that every one direction is a member of\njust one orthogonal triple approximates any direction\narbitrarily closely. In DCK there are no interlocking\ntriples, the question of contextuality does not arise and\nDCK trivially is KS colourable. Clifton and Kent, in\naddition, have explicitly shown that DCK is large enough to\nallow probability distributions over value assignments arbitrarily\nclose to all QM distributions. Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) can be\nunderstood as thus arguing that even an empirical test of\nKS-uncolourable directions confirming the QM predictions cannot prove\nthe contextuality of Nature. Because of the test\u2019s finite precision it\nis impossible to disprove the contention that unwittingly we have\ntested close-by members of a KS-colourable set. One quite obvious\nobjection to this type of argument is that the original KS argument\nworks for possessed values, not measured values, so the MKC argument,\ndealing on finite precision of measurement, misses the mark. We might\nnot be able to test observables which are exactly orthogonal or\nexactly alike in different tests, but it would be a strange\nHV interpretation that asserts that such components do not exist (see\nCabello 1999 in Other Internet Resources). Of course, such a\nnoncontextual HV proposal would be immune to the KS argument, but it\nwould be forced to either assume that not for every one of the\ncontinuously many directions in physical space there is an observable,\nor else that there are not continuously many directions in physical\nspace. Neither assumption seems very attractive. \n\n\nIn addition, the MKC argument is dissatisfying even for measured\nvalues, since it exploits the finite precision of real measurements\nonly in one of the above senses, but presupposes infinite precision in\nthe other. MKC assume, for measured observables, that there is finite\nprecision in the choice of different orthogonal triples, such that we\ncannot, in general, have exactly the same observable twice, as a\nmember of two different triples. However, MKC still assume infinite\nprecision, i.e. exact orthogonality, within the triple (otherwise the\ncolouring constraints could find no application, at all). It has been\nclaimed that this feature can be exploited to rebut the argument and\nto re-install contextualism (see Mermin 1999 and Appleby 2000, both in\nOther Internet Resources, and Appleby 2005).\n\n\nFinally, it seems plausible to assume that probabilities vary\ncontinuously as we change directions in R3, so small imperfections of\nselection of observables that block the argument (but only for measured\nvalues!) in the single case will wash out in the long run (see Mermin\n1999, in Other Internet Resources). This in itself does not constitute\nan argument, since in the\ncolourable sets of observables in MKC\u2019s constructions\nprobabilities also vary (in a sense)\n continuously.[17]\n We might, however, exploit Mermin\u2019s reasoning in the following\nway. Reconsider Clifton\u2019s set of eight directions (in Figure 3)\nleading to a colouring constraint for the outermost points which\nstatistically contradicts the QM statistics by a fraction of\n1/17. Using Clifton and Kent\u2019s colourable set of directions\nDCK we are unable to derive the constraint for the eight\npoints, since these eight points do not lie in DCK; namely,\nas we move, in the colourable subset, from one mutually orthogonal\ntriple of rays to the next, we never hit upon exactly the same ray\nagain, but only on one approximating it arbitrarily closely.  Assume a\nset S of systems wherein observables, corresponding to members of\nDCK and approximating the eight directions in Fig. 3\narbitrarily closely, all have values \u2014 in accordance with the HV\npremise. Then we can derive Clifton\u2019s constraint for the\noutermost points in the following sense. Consider the subset\nS\u2032 \u2282 S of systems where any direction\napproximating point (1, 1, 1) gets value 1 (or colour white). In order\nto meet the predictions of QM, in S\u2032 all directions\napproximating (1, 0, \u22121) and (1, \u22121, 0) must receive values such that\nthe probability of value 0 (or colour black) is extremely close to\n1. Analogously, in another subset S\u2033 \u2282 S\nof systems with directions approximating (\u22121, 1, 1) as having value 1\n(colour white) all directions approximating (1, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0)\nmust receive values such that the probability of value 0 (colour\nblack) is extremely close to 1. Consider now members of\nS\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033. In any of them there will\nbe, for any approximation to (1, 0, \u22121) with value 0 (colour black),\nan exactly orthogonal point that approximates (1, 0, 1) and also has\nvalue 0 (colour black) such that there is a third orthogonal point\napproximating (0, 1, 0) and having value 1 (colour white). Likewise\nfor (0, 0, 1). But (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1) are orthogonal, and for all\nmembers of S\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033 the directions\napproximating them both have value 1 (colour white), while QM\npredicts that the probability for values 1 for the\napproximated directions values is 0. In order to ensure that\nthis prediction is met, S\u2032 \u2229 S\u2033 must\nbe an extremely small subset of S, which is to say that the\nprobability for both (1, 1, 1) and (\u22121, 1, 1) (the leftmost and\nrightmost points in fig. 3) must be close to 0 and approximate 0\nbetter and better as S grows. QM, on the contrary, predicts a\nprobability of 1/17. (Recall also that this number can be pushed up to\n1/3 by choosing a set of 13 directions!)\n\n\nCabello (2002), using a very similar reasoning, has shown that the MKC\nmodels lead to predictions that testably differ from the ones of\nQM. For DCK, he effectively uses the strategy sketched\nabove: QM gives probabilities for directions in the Clifton-Kent set\nwhich their model must match in order to reproduce QM predictions. As\nthese directions are arbitrarily close to directions from a\nKS-uncolourable set (or directions leading to Clifton\u2019s constraint),\nthis leads to restrictions for these nearby points that are measurably\nviolated by the QM predictions. For Meyer\u2019s DM Cabello\u2019s\ncase is even stronger. He explicitly presents a set of nine\nrational vectors leading to predictions different from QM\n(for three of these directions). Hence, the Meyer argument is\neffectively rebutted (without recourse to Mermin\u2019s requirement): Even\nif there were only observables corresponding to the rational\ndirections in R3 (which in itself is an implausible assumption) a\ntheory assuming that they all have noncontextual values faithfully\nrevealed by measurement will be measurably at variance with QM. Assume\nnow that the Cabello directions were tested and the QM predictions\nreliably confirmed, then this would (modulo the reliability of the\ntests) constitute a proof that Nature is contextual. \n\n\nSo, in sum it seems that, as long as we assume that there are\ncontinuously many QM observables (corresponding to the continuum of\ndirections in physical space), statistical tests building, e.g., on\nthe Clifton 1993 or the Cabello/Garc\u00eca-Alcaine 1998 proposal\nremain entirely valid as empirical confirmations of QM and, via the KS\ntheorem, of contextuality. Since these statistical violations of the\nHV programme come about as contradictions of results of QM, VD, VR,\nand NC on the one hand, and QM and experiment on the other, the\nexperimental data still force upon us the trilemma of giving up either\nVD or VR or NC. As we have seen, denial of value realism in the end\nbecomes identical to a kind of contextualism, hence we really have\nonly two options: (1) Giving up VD, either for all observables\nforbidden to have values in the orthodox interpretation (thus giving\nup the HV programme, as defined above), or for a subset of these\nobservables (as modal interpretations do). (2) Endorse a kind of\ncontextualism. Moreover, as things presently stand, the choice between\nthese two options seems not to be a matter of empirical testing, but\none of pure philosophical argument.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Appleby, D.M., 2005, \u201cThe Kochen-Specker\nTheorem\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern\nPhysics</em>, 36: 1\u201328.", "Bacciagaluppi, G., 1995, \u201cKochen-Specker Theorem in the Modal\nInterpretation\u201d, <em>International Journal of Theoretical Physics</em>,\n34: 1205\u201315.", "Barrett, J. and Kent, A., 2004, \u201cNon-Contextuality, Finite\nPrecision Measurement and the Kochen-Specker Theorem\u201d, <em>Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Modern Physics</em>, 35: 151\u201376.\n [<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309017\" target=\"other\">Preprint available online</a>.]", "Bell, J.
