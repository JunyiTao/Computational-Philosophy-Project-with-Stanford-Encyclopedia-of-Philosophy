    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe distinction between a type and its tokens is a\nuseful metaphysical distinction. In \u00a71 it is explained what it\nis, and what it is not. Its importance and wide applicability in\nlinguistics, philosophy, science and everyday life are briefly\nsurveyed in \u00a72.  Whether types are universals is discussed in\n\u00a73. \u00a74 discusses some other suggestions for what types are,\nboth generally and specifically.  Is a type the sets of its tokens?\nWhat exactly is a word, a symphony, a species? \u00a75 asks what a\ntoken is. \u00a76 considers the relation between types and their\ntokens. Do the type and all its tokens share the same properties? Must\nall the tokens be alike in some or all respects? \u00a77 explains some\nproblems for the view that types exist, and some problems for the view\nthat they don't. \u00a78 elucidates a distinction often confused with\nthe type-token distinction, that between a type (or token) and an\noccurrence of it. It also discusses some problems that\noccurrences might be thought to give rise to, and one way to resolve\nthem.\n",
