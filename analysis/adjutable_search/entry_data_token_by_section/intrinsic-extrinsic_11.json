    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis || Perfect Naturalness Theories\n3.2 Perfect Naturalness Theories\n\nThe most influential attempt to analyse intrinsicality over the last\n30 years has arguably been Lewis\u2019s 1986a account of\nintrinsicality in terms of perfect naturalness. \n\nThe perfectly natural properties and relations are the fundamental\nproperties and relations. Lewis wrote:\n\n\nSharing of [the perfectly natural properties] makes for qualitative\nsimilarity, they carve at the joints, they are intrinsic, they are\nhighly specific, the set of their instances are ipso facto not\nentirely miscellaneous, there are only just enough of them to\ncharacterise things completely and without redundancy. Physics has its\nshort list of \u2018fundamental physical properties\u2019: the\ncharges and masses of particles, also their is so-called\n\u2018spins\u2019 and \u2018colours\u2019 and\n\u2018flavours\u2019, and maybe a few more that have yet to be\ndiscovered. (Lewis 1986b, p. 60, author\u2019s emphasis)]\n\n\nThe notion of a perfectly natural, or fundamental, property or\nrelation suggests an appealing approach to analysing intrinsicality.\nConsider the non-intrinsic property of being an uncle. It is appealing\nto think that the reason this property fails to be intrinsic is that\nit can be analysed in terms of more fundamental relations, such as\nbeing a sibling of and being a child of, in a manner that reveals how\nsomething being an uncle is at least partially a matter of how it is\nrelated to things that aren\u2019t part of it. In particular, it is\nplausible to think that the reason being an uncle is non-intrinsic is\nthat for \\(x\\) to be an uncle is for \\(x\\) to have a sibling that has\na child, where this child fails to be part of \\(x\\). More generally,\nit is plausible that, if being \\(F\\) is a non-intrinsic property, then\nthe fact that it is non-intrinsic can be revealed by analysing being\n\\(F\\) in terms of more fundamental properties and relations in a\nmanner that reveals how something being \\(F\\) may partly be a matter\nof being related to a non-part or may be partly a matter of how\nnon-parts are. If this is true, then it has the following two\nconsequences. First, it follows that every fundamental property is\nintrinsic, since it being non-intrinsic cannot be revealed by analysis\nin terms of more fundamental properties and relations. Secondly, and\neven more importantly, it follows that whether a property is intrinsic\nshould be analysable in terms of how that property can be analysed in\nterms of the fundamental properties and relations.\n\nLewis in effect adopts the above approach to analysing intrinsicality\nby analysing intrinsicality in terms of a particular kind of\nsupervenience on the fundamental properties and relations.\nLewis\u2019s 1986 account (formulated so as to be compatible with\nstandard abstractionist theories of possible worlds) consists of (15)\nand (16).\n\n(15)\n \\(p\\) is an\nintrinsic property iff (i) \\(p\\) is a property, and (ii) for any \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), and for any worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that \\(x\\) at\n\\(w_1\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(w_2\\), \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) at \\(w_1\\)\niff \\(y\\) has \\(p\\) at \\(w_2\\).\n\n\n(16)\n \\(x\\) at \\(w_1\\)\nis a duplicate of \\(y\\) at \\(w_2\\) iff there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence \\(f\\) between \\(x\\)\u2019s parts at \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(y\\)\u2019s parts at \\(w_2\\) such that, for any perfectly natural\nproperty or relation \\(R\\), for any \\(x_1, x_2,\\ldots\\) that are part\nof \\(x\\) at \\(w_1\\): \\(x_1, x_2\\ldots\\) stand in \\(R\\) at \\(w_1\\) iff\n\\(f(x_1), f(x_2)\\ldots\\) stand in \\(R\\) at \\(w_2\\). \n\n\nLewis\u2019s account, which I will call perfect naturalness account\n1, is best seen as an attempt at analysing duplication preservation,\nrather than as analysing identity interiority which we argued in\nsection\n 2.5\n is the dominant notion of intrinsicality in philosophy. This account\nrests heavily on the claim that all perfectly natural properties are\nintrinsic, and, implicitly, that the perfectly natural properties and\nrelations are sufficient to characterise the world completely. The\nlast assumption is needed because the theory rules out the possibility\nthat there are two things that share all their perfectly natural\nproperties and lack proper parts, but differ with respect to some of\ntheir intrinsic properties.\n\nThe first assumption that all perfectly natural properties are\nintrinsic has been rejected by Weatherson (2006). (See also Yablo 1999\nwho holds that, even if every perfectly natural property is intrinsic,\nthis fact is at best a lucky accident and that this renders\nLewis\u2019s account unsuccessful as a philosophical account of\nintrinsicality.) Weatherson claims that it is metaphysically possible\nfor the instantiated perfectly natural properties to be vector\nproperties. He then argues that, since vector properties must be\nextrinsic, it follows that at least some perfectly natural properties\nfail to be intrinsic, namely the perfectly natural properties\ninstantiated at such worlds. The claim that vector properties need to\nbe extrinsic, however, is highly contentious. It is natural to\nunderstand a vector property to be a property that is usefully\nrepresented for theoretical purposes by a certain kind of mathematical\nobject, namely a vector. Given this construal, however, there is no\nreason to think that vector properties cannot be intrinsic. For\nexample, due to the similarity relationships between colours\nrepresented by the colour solid it might be useful to represent\ncolours by vectors. However, doing this is compatible with\nmetaphysical theories of colour on which colours are intrinsic. There\nmight be other conceptions of being a vector property on which vector\nproperties cannot be intrinsic. However, it is unclear whether there\nan conception of vector properties on which they cannot be intrinsic\nbut can be fundamental. (See Busse (2009) and Marshall (2016b) for\nmore discussion.)\n\nThe second assumption, that the perfectly natural properties and\nrelations are sufficient to characterise each possible world, has been\nrejected by Sider (1995) and Schaffer (2004). Both claim that it is\nmetaphysically possible for there to be endless sequences of more and\nmore natural properties, without any set of perfectly natural\nproperties out of which all the other properties can be defined. In\nresponse to this problem, Sider (1993b) has proposed a modification of\nLewis\u2019s account which he claims is consistent with there being\nsuch endless sequences of more and more natural properties. Sider\n(2011) and Marshall (2016b) have recently argued in favour of the\nsecond assumption, with Sider\u2019s argument appealing to his Humean\ntheory of metaphysical possibility.\n\nAs noted above, Lewis\u2019s account fails to provide an account of\nidentity interiority, which is the most standard notion of\nintrinsicality, and at best provides an analysis of duplication\npreservation. Marshall 2016b has recently provided an account in terms\nof perfect naturalness that, if successful, does provide an analysis\nof identity interiority. If this account works, it can also be\nmodified to provide analyses of the other notions of intrinsicality\ndescribed in section\n 2.4.\n\nThe basic idea behind this alternative account of intrinsicality,\nwhich I will call perfect naturalness account 2, is that the\nascription of a property to a thing is intrinsically about that thing\niff the ascription can be expressed in fundamental terms while only\nreferring to, and quantifying over, the parts of \\(x\\). (A similar\naccount is briefly sketched in Skow 2007, p. 112.) In more detail,\nperfect naturalness account 2 first analyses intrinsicality in terms\nof intrinsic aboutness by (3).\n\n(3)\n \\(p\\) is intrinsic iff, necessarily, for any \\(x\\), the\nascription of \\(p\\) to \\(x\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\). \n\n\nIt then provides an account of intrinsic aboutness in terms of perfect\nnaturalness and qualitivity by (17), where qualitivity is analysed by\n(Q). (In (17) and (Q), perfectly natural operators and quantifiers are\nfundamental operators and quantifiers.)\n\n(17)\n \\(s\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\) iff \\(s\\) is a non-qualitative\nstate of affairs that can be expressed by a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\ncontaining at most brackets, commas, lambda abstractors, names\nreferring to parts of \\(x\\), predicates expressing perfectly natural\nproperties and relations, operator expressions expressing perfectly\nnatural operators, and quantifier expressions that express perfectly\nnatural quantifiers and whose occurrences in \\(\\phi\\) quantify only\nover parts of \\(x\\). \n\n\n(Q)\n \\(p\\) is a\nqualitative property iff \\(p\\) is a property, and \\(p\\) can be\nexpressed by a predicate containing at most brackets, commas,\nvariables, lambda abstractors, predicates expressing perfectly natural\nrelations, quantifier expressions expressing perfectly natural\nquantifiers, and operator expressions expressing perfectly natural\noperators. \n\n\n(17) entails that any state of affairs that is intrinsically about\nsomething is non-qualitative. This consequence of (17) can be\njustified by noting that, if \\(s\\) is intrinsically about \\(x\\), then\nthere must be at least one particular thing that it is about, and\nhence it cannot be a qualitative state of affairs.\n\n(17), as it stands, fails to provide a completely specified account of\nintrinsic aboutness, since it contains the locution \u2018quantifies\nonly over parts of \\(x\\)\u2019 which needs to be defined, and giving\nthe needed definition is not straightforward. The account of\n\u2018quantifying over parts of \\(x\\)\u2019 given by perfect\nnaturalness account 2 can be simplified if we assume that\n\u2018some\u2019 expresses the only perfectly natural quantifier.\nSay that a property \\(p\\) necessitates a property \\(q\\) iff,\nnecessarily, for any \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) has \\(p\\) then \\(x\\) has \\(q\\).\nIf \\(\\Phi\\) is a set of formulas, let \\(\\bigvee\\Phi\\) be the\ndisjunction of the formulas in \\(\\Phi\\). (So \\(\\bigvee\\{\\phi_1 ,\n\\phi_2,\\ldots\\}\\) = \\(\\ulcorner\\phi_1 \\vee \\phi_2\n\\vee\\ldots\\urcorner\\).) Given these definitions and the above\nsimplifying assumption, perfect naturalness account 2 endorses (18),\nwhere \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are predicates expressing properties and\n\u2018\\(\\leq\\)\u2019 symbolises \u2018is part of\u2019.\n\n(18)\n The initial occurrence of \u2018Some\u2019 in \\(\\ulcorner\n[\\text{Some } v|Fv]Gv\\urcorner\\) quantifies only over parts of \\(x\\)\niff, for any set \\(\\Pi \\) of names of all the parts of \\(x\\), the\nproperty expressed by \\(F\\) necessitates the property expressed by\n\\(\\ulcorner\\lambda v\\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq a\\urcorner \\mid\na\\in\\Pi\\}\\urcorner\\). \n\n\nFor example, according to this account, if \\(d\\) has exactly three\nproper parts (which are \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)), then\n\u2018some\u2019 in \u2018[Some \\(v \\mid Fv](Gv)\\)\u2019\nquantifies only over parts of \\(d\\) iff the property of being \\(F\\)\nnecessitates the property of being part of either \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\)\nor \\(d\\) (that is, iff, necessarily, any thing that is \\(F\\) is part\nof either \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) or \\(d\\)). More generally, this account\nendorses (19).\n\n(19)\n For any formulas\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\), the initial occurrence of \u2018Some\u2019 in\n\\(\\ulcorner [\\text{Some }v\\mid \\phi]\\psi\\urcorner\\) quantifies only\nover parts of \\(x\\) iff, for any set \\(\\Pi\\) of names of all the parts\nof \\(x\\), under any assignment \\(g\\) to the free variables in \\(\\phi\\)\nthat are not \\(v\\), the property expressed by \\(\\ulcorner\\lambda\nv\\phi\\urcorner\\) necessitates the property expressed by\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ulcorner\\lambda v\\big( \\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq u \\urcorner \\mid u&\n\\text{ is a free variable in } \\phi \\text{ that is not } v\\} \\\\\n &\\vee \\bigvee\\{\\ulcorner v\\leq a\\urcorner \\mid a\\in\\Pi\\}\\urcorner.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nGiven the simplifying assumption that \u2018some\u2019 is the only\nperfectly natural quantifier expression, (3), (17), (Q) and (19)\nprovide the complete account of what it is for a property to be\nintrinsic according to perfect naturalness account 2.\n\nAs with perfect naturalness account 1, perfect naturalness account 2\nassumes that each perfectly natural property is intrinsic and that the\nperfectly natural properties, relations, operators and quantifiers are\nable to completely describe every possible world. If someone rejects\nthese assumptions, they will therefore be unable to endorse this\naccount.\n",
