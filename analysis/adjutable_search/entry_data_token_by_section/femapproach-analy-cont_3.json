    "main_text": "Freedom and Domination || The Continental Tradition\n2.1 The Continental Tradition\n\nButler begins her analysis in Gender Trouble (1990) by\nreturning to Irigaray and Kristeva\u2019s criticism of Beauvoir and\narguing that their insights into the closed nature of a gendered\nlinguistic system raise issues about a substance-accident metaphysics\nas a whole. According to this metaphysics, both sex and gender are\nmeant to be accidental attributes attached to a substantial subject.\nOne is essentially a subject and only accidentally a male or female,\nmasculine or feminine one. Yet, if women can be defined only in terms\nof men, as the Other of men, then sex and gender are not as much\naccidents as they are relations \u2013 not attributes a subject\npossesses but oppositions between linguistic terms: male versus female\nand masculine versus feminine. Furthermore, if sex and gender are not\nattributes, perhaps we should rethink the subject or substance to\nwhich they are meant to attach. Perhaps there is only language which,\nin articulating a relation between male and female, masculine and\nfeminine, posits a substance on which to erect those terms. Butler\nquotes Michel Haar\u2019s commentary on Nietzsche:\n\nAll psychological categories (the ego, the individual, the person)\nderive from the illusion of substantial identity. But this illusion\ngoes back basically to a superstition that deceives not only common\nsense but also philosophers \u2013 namely, the belief in language\nand, more precisely, in the truth of grammatical categories (1977,\n17\u20138).\n\n\nIn other words, language inspires us to add substantial identities to\nactions because verbs need subjects. Turning from Nietzsche to J.L.\nAustin, Butler conceives of women (and men) as\n\u201cperformatives.\u201d Performative speech acts for Austin are\nutterances such as \u201cthe meeting is now open\u201d or \u201cI\nnow pronounce you husband and wife\u201d in which, uttered under\nappropriate circumstances, the speech act does something by saying\nsomething. The speech act thus brings a state of affairs into\nexistence. Likewise, according to Butler, the language of sex and\ngender, appropriately institutionalized, creates men and women.\n\nWhat is meant by appropriately institutionalized? For Foucault (1978)\nthe most important sites of power lie in everyday social practices\nsuch as social work, medicine and psychiatry, in scientific and social\nscientific disciplines that type individuals and create categories of\nidentity, and in institutions such as prisons, schools and hospitals.\nSuch power is productive: social institutions and practices create\nmodern identities such as gays, Blacks and manic-depressives. For\nButler and others, the construction of men and women takes a similar\npath as the result of compulsory heterosexuality. As a form of power,\ncompulsory heterosexuality imposes a set of norms about how and whom\nwe should desire and establishes a set of sanctions from this set. By\ndoing so, it divides human populations into two genders that are in\nturn supposed to be connected to two sexes with two directions of\nsexual desire. Thus, one is a man with a male body and a desire for\nwomen or one is a woman with a female body and a desire for men.\n\u201cThe heterosexualization of desire,\u201d Butler writes,\n\u201crequires and institutes the production of discrete and\nasymmetrical oppositions between \u2018feminine\u2019 and\n\u2018masculine,\u2019 where these are understood as expressive\nattributes of \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019\u201d\n(1990, 17).\n\nThis account of identities as effects of power obviously raises the\nquestion of what happens to our capacities for critical agency and\nrational reflection, capacities to which Marxists and other social\ncritics have traditionally appealed for a purchase on relations of\npower and subordination. If the subject, as a woman or gay person for\nexample, is an effect of power, the structure of oppression is already\nbuilt into the identity. How can women or gay people be agents for the\nemancipation of, or equal justice for, women or gay people if their\nidentity is itself an effect of unequal power relations? Indeed, if we\nbecome subjects at all only within everyday disciplinary practices,\nthen subjects are always already effects of power. To emancipate\nourselves from power would be to emancipate ourselves from ourselves.\nHow then how are we to address issues of freedom and autonomy?\n\nButler looks to resignification. Power not only produces but\nreproduces itself. This constant production and reproduction opens\npossibilities for \u201cresignification, redeployment, subversive\ncitation from within, and interruption and inadvertent convergences\nwith other [power/discourse] networks\u201d (1995, 135). Yet other\nContinental feminists find this approach unsatisfying. Nancy Fraser\nfinds the positive connotations that Butler associates with\nresignification \u201cpuzzling.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d she asks,\n\u201cis resignification good? Can\u2019t there be bad (oppressive,\nreactionary) resignifications?\u201d(1995, 67\u20138). If all\nsubjectivity is a construction of power/discourse networks, why should\nwe not simply be content with the subjects that our current\ndisciplinary practices enforce? Or, if some resignifications are good,\nwhich ones? How do we determine which sort we should endorse?\n\nIn general, Fraser thinks feminists too eagerly turned to\npoststructuralist theories in the 1990s and that this turn has\nconsequences: not only does it leave women with no prospects for\nchange other than resignification but it also reduces gender\ninequality to a matter of language and culture. Here her criticism is\ndirected at what she calls Lacanianism in feminism (2013). The work of\nLacanian feminists has some merit, she says, in that it shows gender\nto be a discursive construction. Sexual identity is based on the\nprocess of identification, language, and socialization in which the\nchild enters into the symbolic order, governed by the incest taboo or\nwhat Lacan calls \u201cthe law of the Father.\u201d Subjugation to\nthat law and becoming a subject are thus one and the same. Given the\nlaw\u2019s phallocentric tilt, women are pretty much condemned.\nNevertheless this analysis remains too historically unspecific for\nFraser. What we need from discourse theory, she maintains, are\ninsights into how our social identities are formed and altered over\ntime, how social groups form and disintegrate, how dominant groups\nretain their cultural dominance and what the prospects are for\nemancipatory change.\n\nMoreover, we need to balance cultural with economic analysis. For\nFraser (2007), gender is a two-dimensional identity. It organizes a\nstatus hierarchy, one on which what she calls cultural feminism\nfocuses, that permeates popular culture and everyday interactions in\nways that demean women. But gender also structures a material and\neconomic division between paid productive work and unpaid domestic\nwork, and within paid productive work, it largely structures the\ndivision between higher-paid manufacturing and professional\noccupations and lower-paid, \u201cpink collar\u201d ones. An\nadequate feminist theory, she claims, must therefore allow for two\nindependent, cultural and material analytic perspectives. In another\nwork (2009), she adds a third political perspective to deal with\nissues of representation.  Feminism for the 99%: A Manifesto\n(2019), written with Cinzia Arruzza and Tithi Bhattacharya, takes up\nthese tasks, focusing on the need to fight for affordable housing,\ndecent paying jobs, universal healthcare, and the like in order to win\nfor women and working people in general the freedom to determine the\ncourse of their own lives.\n\nSeyla Benhabib (1995), Amy Allen (2008) and Allison Weir (2013) also\nquestion Butlerian equations between identity, law and power that seem\nto deprive women of agency. Benhabib distinguishes between a stronger\nand a weaker version of the claim that identities such as women and\ngay people are constructions of power (1995, 20). The stronger version\ninsists that subjects are entirely the effects of power, particularly\nof a compulsory heterosexuality, and that as effects they can only\naccept their mode of being a subject or try to subvert it from within.\nA weaker version of the claim, however, would simply emphasize that\ninfants are born into a world of existing gendered relations,\nhierarchies and distributions of power and are acculturated into this\nworld by parents, teachers and the like. To say that infants are born\ninto prevailing structures of power, however, is not to say that they\nare already entirely constituted by them. Hence, Benhabib claims,\nthere remain capacities for reflection and accountability that are not\nsimply themselves effects of power.\n\nWhile more sympathetic to Foucault and Butler, Allen uses Jessica\nBenjamin\u2019s (1988) account of recognition to make a similar\npoint. There may be \u201cno outside to power, in the sense that\nthere is no possible human social world from which power has been\ncompletely eliminated.\u201d Nevertheless, we need not deny\n\u201cmoments of mutual recognition\u2026within ongoing,\ndynamically unfolding, social relationships\u201d that can provide\nfor both the constitution of autonomous selves and a reference point\nfor social and political critique (2008, 91). Weir likewise stresses\nrelations of recognition, as well as of \u201cidentification, of\nflourishing, of meaning, of love, of different kinds of power,\nincluding empowerment and solidarity\u201d (2013, 91). Again,\nresistance to domination is not just a matter of resignifying within\noppressive structures. Rather it is a matter of transforming women.\nIndeed, Weir asks \u201cWhat have we been doing in our women\u2019s\nstudies programs, associations of feminist philosophers and academics,\nfeminist movements, lesbian communities, women\u2019s cooperative,\nand culture building and other alternative communities if we\nhaven\u2019t been \u2026producing women as something other than\nsubjected?\u201d (2013, 94).\n",
