    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Further Moral Theory\n4.3 Further Moral Theory\n\n\nIn addition to work in environmental ethics, Sylvan wrote on other\nethical issues including arguments for moral obligations to future\ngenerations (cf. Routley and Routley 1978, Sylvan and Plumwood 1991),\nand the ethics of energy choice (Routley and Routley 1979c). The\nargument offered in the latter paper against nuclear power centres on\nthe (anthropocentric but nonetheless, in Sylvan\u2019s view, salient)\nclaim that bequeathing toxic nuclear waste to future generations\nconstitutes an ethically unacceptable shift of costs onto others. And\na similar argument was mounted against conspicuous consumption of\nfossil fuels from what Sylvan and Plumwood then referred to as\n\u201catmosphere heating\u201d (Routley and Routley 1979c, \u00a73).\nTheirs appear to be amongst the earliest philosophical discussions\nfocussing on the ethics of climate change. And it is not just the\nclaimed immorality following from the consequences of climate change\nto future humans, though that is given weight; from a deep green\nperspective, the claimed erosion of value outstrips mere\nanthropocentric concerns and needs to take into account non-human\nnature, where the resultant erosion of intrinsic value is taken to\nloom large.\n\n\nConsidering destructive practices more generally, beyond those\ndestructive of the environment, Sylvan considered violence against\npersons, arguing that not only was nuclear war immoral, but that which\nconditionally promised it, nuclear deterrence, was also immoral (cf.\nRoutley 1984a). In fact, violence in general was, he argued, immoral,\ndefending pacifism and responding to the standard objections to it in\nRoutley (1984b).\n\n\nIn formal ethics, Sylvan defended a non-classical deontic logic.\nRoutley and Plumwood (1989) argued that the existence of moral\ndilemmas establishes the need both for: (i) a non-classical\npropositional logic underpinning deontic logic; and (ii) the rejection\nof some other central principles of orthodox deontic logic, especially\nthe principle of deontic consistency\n\n\n(PC)\n\\(\\mathrm{O}A \\rightarrow \\twiddle\\mathrm{O}\\twiddle A\\)\n\n\n\nand the Kantian principle ought-implies-can (since dilemmas create\nimpossible obligations). He argues that the sentential fragment of\ndeontic logic must be paraconsistent and a relevant logic is\nrecommended (see Section 2).\n\n\nSylvan saw his ethics as systematically connected with issues in\nsocial and political philosophy, extending out from \u201cdeep green\nethics\u201d to a broader \u201cdeep green theory\u201d that\n\u201cincludes a radical social and political theory, centred upon\nsocial anarchistic forms of organization \u2026 and elements of\nradical economic theory \u2026 There have to be changes in\nsocial and political arrangements \u2026 towards less consumptive,\npopulous and wasteful societies, and so on\u201d (Sylvan and Bennett\n1994, 151).\n\n\nSome of these ideas are discussed at length in Routley and Routley\n(1980b) where alternative forms of economic and political organisation\nare first considered from an environmental perspective. Sylvan focuses\nhis attention on what he takes to be an evident failure of the\npolitical arrangements proposed in the West. According to him, the\ngreat limitations to the freedom of human beings, the uneven\ndistribution of wealth and, above all, the constant damages caused to\nthe environment are all symptoms of a disease that must be treated.\nSylvan argues for what he calls pluralist anarchism, (a form\nof socialist anarchism) abandoning any form of government, including\nthe minimal one defended by Robert Nozick (2013).\n",
