    "main_text": "Acquaintance and Noninferential Knowledge || Demonstrative Concepts and Phenomenal Concepts\n3.2 Demonstrative Concepts and Phenomenal Concepts\n\nNot all acquaintance theorists require acquaintance with the\ncorrespondence (or some other epistemically relevant relation) between\nsome thought or proposition and a distinct fact for one to have\nknowledge by acquaintance. Rather than require a further act of\nawareness, some acquaintance theorists add constraints to the nature\nof the foundational belief or the manner in which it is formed so that\nacquaintance with some mental state or mental feature provides part of\nthe content of the belief itself, and does so in such a way as to\nguarantee the truth of the belief. For example, according to McGrew\n(1995, 1999), for any object of acquaintance or direct awareness, it\nis possible to form a belief in which a demonstrative concept refers\ndirectly to it. By virtue of my acquaintance with a painful\nexperience, I believe directly of it that it exists, or that the\nproperty (painfulness) is instantiated. We could express the belief\nroughly by saying \u201cI am experiencing this\u201d\n(McGrew 1995, 1999), or \u201cthis is instantiated (in me,\nnow)\u201d (Gertler 2012). For this kind of belief (unlike\nmost other beliefs regarding contingent facts), to genuinely\nunderstand or grasp the content of the belief is to grasp its\ntruth. \n\nIt is important to see how this is different from the standard view of\ndemonstrative concepts. On the standard view, a demonstrative concept\nis something like an indexical (see the entry on\n indexicals).\n Consider indexical concepts like I, here, and now.\nThe reference of these concepts is fixed by the context, by the\nspeaker or thinker\u2019s identity, location, and time. On the\nstandard view, the content of a token indexical concept is\nconstituted by or essentially tied to the actual referent, much as the\ncontent of the concept water is constituted by or essentially\ntied to the actual referent in the environment (at least according to\ncontent-externalism about natural-kind concepts). The standard view of\ndemonstratives is similar. The actual referent of a token\ndemonstrative concept is taken to constitute or be essential to its\ncontent, but unlike the indexical concepts just discussed, the\nreference of a demonstrative is not fixed automatically by the\nspeaker\u2019s identity, location and time; something else is needed\nto fix the reference. Different views of the reference-fixing factor\nhave been proposed, with the main suggestions being that reference is\nfixed by one or more of the following: a demonstration,\nunderstood as an act of pointing or gesturing or some similar\nbehavior; an intention to point or refer to an object of a\ncertain kind, or an object satisfying some description; or some\nappropriate causal or spatial relation (e.g., between the\nagent\u2019s pointing or utterance and some item in the environment).\nWhat is important for our purposes is that none of these views take\nthe reference-fixing to be done purely by acquaintance or direct\nawareness. On McGrew\u2019s view, the reference is fixed by\ndirect awareness, and not by acts of pointing or gesturing,\nby the subject\u2019s intentions to refer to a certain sort of thing,\nor by causal relations. \n\nMcGrew is not alone in holding that experiential or phenomenal\nfeatures can, by virtue of our direct awareness of them, constitute\nthe content of a special class of concepts. Gertler (2001, 2011,\n2012), Chalmers (2003, 2010), and Nida-R\u00fcmelin (2004) defend\nviews very much in the same spirit. Gertler (2001) distinguishes\nbetween ordinary demonstratives, which typically involve an intention\nto pick out an entity that satisfies some description, and a\npure demonstrative, which picks out its referent solely by a\nfundamental act of attention or acquaintance. Chalmers (2003, 2010)\ndefends a similar view according to which some noninferential beliefs\nare justified by virtue of involving a \u201cdirect phenomenal\nconcept,\u201d a concept whose content is constituted by a\nphenomenal quality with which one is acquainted. The view is supported\nby considering Frank Jackson\u2019s (1982) hypothetical case of Mary,\nwho has learned all of the physical facts about color but has never\nhad a visual experience in color until one day she experiences red.\nJackson argues there that Mary thereby learns some new information;\nshe acquires some new knowledge. And since Mary already knows all the\nphysical facts about color, this new item of knowledge must, Jackson\nargues, be of a non-physical fact. Chalmers (2010) and\nNida-R\u00fcmelin (2004) argue that it is difficult to make sense of\nthe epistemic progress of subjects like Jackson\u2019s Mary unless we\naccept that there is a core phenomenal concept whose content is\nconstituted by an underlying phenomenal or experiential quality with\nwhich the subject is acquainted. Chalmers (2004) relies on the\nacquaintance approach to phenomenal concepts to defend the knowledge\nargument for dualism\u2014i.e., the claim that Mary acquires new\nknowledge, and that this must be knowledge of a non-physical\nfact. (He notes (2003: 227) that demonstratives are naturally\nused to express direct phenomenal concepts (e.g., \u201cI am\nexperiencing this quality\u201d), and that there may be a\nsense in which a direct phenomenal concept is a\n\u201cdemonstrative\u201d concept, but he avoids such a label at\nleast in part because of the danger of confusing direct phenomenal\nconcepts with demonstrative ones as usually understood.) It is worth\nnoting that, in contrast, some philosophers appeal to knowledge by\nacquaintance to make sense of Mary\u2019s new knowledge in order to\noppose, rather than to support, the success of the knowledge argument\nfor a dualistic conclusion (e.g., Conee 1994 and Balog 2012). \n\nMcGrew endorses classical foundationalism, taking all our empirical\nknowledge to rest on a foundation of knowledge that is had by\nacquaintance or direct awareness, and in particular on demonstrative\nbeliefs. While Chalmers and Gertler seem somewhat sympathetic to\nclassical foundationalism, they have been concerned primarily to\ndefend the claim that at least some introspective beliefs or beliefs\nregarding one\u2019s own phenomenal states constitute the most secure\nsort of empirical, noninferential knowledge or justified belief, and\nthat these beliefs owe their privileged epistemic status to\nacquaintance. Thus, Gertler (2012) endorses the acquaintance approach\nfor a limited class of introspective judgments, and leaves it open\nwhether there could be other sources of noninferential\njustification.\n\nSome worry that the demonstrative strategy yields beliefs with very\nlittle content (Sosa 2003b). If, however, we keep in mind that the\ncontent of the belief is secured by the subject\u2019s direct\nawareness of the phenomenal features themselves then it is unclear why\nthe content can\u2019t be as rich as the features attended to. A more\nserious worry in the vicinity is that, insofar as a demonstrative\nconcept is only possessed by the subject for as long as the\nparticular experience or property instance is given or presented, we\nhave no account of how concepts that the subject can possess over time\nas experiences change can be applied directly to experience. Even if\npurely demonstrative beliefs have an important role to play at the\nfoundations, many classical foundationalists will want to allow that\nsome concepts that we already possess can be compared directly to\nexperience to yield foundational knowledge. Unless some foundational\nbeliefs involve such enduring concepts, concepts whose connections to\nother concepts we have had the opportunity to grasp, it will be\ndifficult to see how these foundations could support various other\nbeliefs that are intuitively justified. To accommodate such\nfoundations, Chalmers (2003) suggests that subjects might retain\nknowledge of what an experience is like even after the experience is\nlong gone, by acquiring what he calls a standing phenomenal\nconcept. Standing phenomenal concepts are still very much like direct\nphenomenal concepts in that the content is essentially tied to\nphenomenal properties. While Chalmers does not say exactly what\ndetermines the content of such concepts, he finds it\n\n\nplausible that their content is determined by some combination of (1)\nnon-sensory phenomenal states of a cognitive sort, which bear a\nrelevant relation to the original phenomenal quality in\nquestion\u2014e.g., a faint Humean phenomenal \u2018idea\u2019 that\nis relevantly related to the original \u2018impression\u2019; (2)\ndispositions to have such states; and (3) dispositions to recognize\ninstances of the phenomenal quality in question.
