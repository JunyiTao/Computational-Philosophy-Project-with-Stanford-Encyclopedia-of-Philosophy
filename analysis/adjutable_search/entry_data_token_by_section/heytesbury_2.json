    "main_text": "Logic || Proprietates terminorum\n2.2 Proprietates terminorum\n\nThe genre of \u201cproprietates\n terminorum\u201d developed in the twelfth century alongside the\nreception of Aristotle\u2019s Sophistical refutations, and\nthe logico-semantical analysis of fallacies seems to have been one of\nits primary\n applications.[13]\n It is an umbrella genre for, among others, theories of meaning and\nreference, the use-mention distinction, quantification, and tense.\nThese are utilized in several of Heytesbury\u2019s works with\nterminological variations. Three of these issues will be presented\nhere: the theories of \u201csuppositio\u201d,\n\u201cmobilitatio\u201d, and\n\u201campliatio\u201d.\n\nSupposition is a semantic relation between terms and the object(s)\nthey stand for in a sentential context. The modes of supposition are\nconnected to the way sentences can be analyzed (expositio),\nin particular, to the way general terms can be replaced by a\nstructured collection of subordinate terms, the so-called\n\u201cdescensus\u201d. The following classifications of\nsuppositions can be reconstructed from Heytesbury\u2019s\nwritings:\n\n(1) material supposition (s. materialis)\n(2) personal supposition (s. personalis)\n\n\n(2.1) discrete supposition (s. discreta)\n(2.2) common supposition (s. communis)\n\n\n(2.21) determinate supposition (s. determinata)\n(2.22) confused supposition (s. confusa)\n\n\n(2.221) merely confused or non-distributive supposition (s.\nconfusa tantum, confusa non distributiva)\n(2.222) confused and distributive supposition (s. confusa\ndistributiva)\n \n \n \n\n\nMaterial supposition (\u201conly you are a donkey\u201d in\n\u201conly you are a donkey is false\u201d) consists in mentioning\nan expression ([SophAs] 403), whereas personal (or significative)\nsupposition consists in using it ([SophAs] 404). Discrete supposition\nis a personal supposition of a singular term ([SophAs]\n 390);[14]\n its complement is usually called \u201ccommon\u201d supposition and\nis further divided into determinate and confused suppositions.\nDeterminate supposition is exemplified by the supposition of\n\u201chuman\u201d in \u201csome human is an animal\u201d ([SCD]\n1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427]), connected to the descensus,\nwhereby it can be paraphrased as \u201cthis human is an animal or\nthat human is an animal etc.\u201d ([SophAs] 387). Merely confused or\nnon-distributive supposition is exemplified by the supposition of\n\u201canimal\u201d in \u201cevery human is an animal\u201d and\nconnected to \u201cdisjunctive\u201d descensus ([SCD] 1494,\nfol. 2va\u2013vb [1988a: 420\u2013421]; [Soph] soph. 7 [1494: fol.\n106rb] and soph. 16 (1494: fol. 127vb)), whereby it can be paraphrased\nas \u201cevery man is this animal or that animal etc.\u201d Confused\nand distributive suppositions are most typically exemplified by the\nsupposition of \u201chuman\u201d in \u201cevery human is an\nanimal\u201d, connecting the descensus to every instance of\nthe common term, whereby it can be paraphrased as \u201cthis human is\nan animal and that human is an animal etc.\u201d ([SCD] 1494: fol.\n2va\u2013vb [1988a: 420\u2013421]; [Soph] soph. 7 [1494: fol. 106rb]\nand soph. 16 [1494: fol. 127vb]).\n\nThe theory of suppositio is extended by the theory of\n\u201cmobility\u201d and \u201cimmobility\u201d. If a particular\nmode of descensus is admissible, that type of supposition is\ncalled \u201cmobile\u201d (mobilis); otherwise it is called\n\u201cimmobile\u201d\n (immobilis).[15]\n Heytesbury\u2019s example of immobile supposition is the function of\n\u201cpenny\u201d in \u201cI promise you a penny\u201d or\n\u201chuman\u201d in \u201cby necessity, every man is an\nanimal\u201d ([PC] 1494: fol. 188vb; [IHT] arg. 19; [SophAs]\n398).\n\nThree points should be noted here. First, the so-called\n\u201csimple\u201d (\u201chuman\u201d in \u201chuman is a\nspecies\u201d) supposition is\n omitted.[16]\n Second, Heytesbury\u2019s analysis of predicates in terms of the\nmerely confused supposition is nominalist, as opposed to the realist\nanalysis of these examples in terms of standing for an abstract\n object.[17]\n Third, Heytesbury endorses the Aristotelian sensus\ncompositus-sensus divisus distinction, rather than the\nterminist framework in cases where that would be\n appropriate.[18]\n\nLastly, Heytesbury introduces the so-called\n\u201campliatio\u201d, which consists in extending the\nrange of a term to non-actual entities, such as entities in the past,\nfuture, or mere possibilia. Thus, for instance, the proper paraphrase\nof the sentence \u201ca white thing can be black\u201d is\n\u201csomething that now is white or can be white can be black\u201d\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 2va [1988a:\n 418]).[19]\n The complementary property is called\n\u201crestrictio\u201d ([Soph] soph. 4 [1494: fol.\n89vb]).\n",
