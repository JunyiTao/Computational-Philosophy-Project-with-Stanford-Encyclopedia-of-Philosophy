    "main_text": "Doxastic Accounts || Weak Accuracy\n2.3 Weak Accuracy\n\n\nWeak accuracy accounts are typically motivated by the wish to deny\nthat moral virtues can require epistemic defects like ignorance or\nfalse beliefs. They differ from strong accuracy accounts, however, in\nthat they strictly speaking allow that modesty or humility is\ncompatible with epistemic defects. For most defenders of these views,\nhowever, the ideal case will be of moral virtue without any ignorance\nor false belief.\n\n\nNon-overestimation accounts deny that modesty or humility requires\nunderestimation and instead claim that all that is required is not\noverestimating one\u2019s own good qualities. Flanagan (1990) defends\nthis kind of account for modesty and Richards (1988) for humility. This\nkind of account allows that the modest or humble person can have\naccurate self-knowledge. It also makes the virtue compatible with\nignorance since one way of not overestimating one\u2019s good\nqualities is to underestimate them, though Flanagan claims that\n\u201cideally\u201d this will not happen (1990, 427).\n\n\nAnother type of weak accuracy account is the de-emphasis account.\nDefended by Ridge (2000) this account makes modesty a matter of\nde-emphasizing one\u2019s good qualities for the right reasons.\nDe-emphasizing here includes things like not going out of your way to\nstress the significance of your good qualities. This kind of account\nallows modesty to be compatible with accurate self-knowledge, though\nde-emphasis is also compatible with inaccurate self-assessment too.\n\n\nFinally, Raterman (2006) defends a reluctance account of modesty. On\nthis account a person is modest when they are reluctant to evaluate\nthemselves in terms of their good qualities. This allows the modest\nperson to have accurate self-knowledge as long as they are reluctant to\nevaluate themselves through the lens of their good qualities. Though it\ndoes not require ignorance, various inaccurate self-assessments are\ncompatible with being reluctant to self-evaluate in these ways. This\naccount has the benefit of providing a more nuanced view of when\nself-ascriptions of modesty are self-undermining; Raterman points out\nthat his account allows that saying \u201cI am modest\u201d in a\nquiet conversation with a close friend need not be self-undermining\n(2006, 232).\n",
