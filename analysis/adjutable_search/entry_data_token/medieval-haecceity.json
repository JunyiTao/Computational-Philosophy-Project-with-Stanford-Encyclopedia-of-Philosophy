As understood by Scotus, a haecceity is not a bare\nparticular underlying qualities. It is, rather, a\nnon-qualitative property of a substance or thing: it is a\n\u201cthisness\u201d (a haecceitas, from the Latin\nhaec, meaning \u201cthis\u201d) as opposed to a\n\u201cwhatness\u201d (a quidditas, from the Latin\nquid, meaning \u201cwhat\u201d) \u2013 akin to what are\nsometimes known in recent philosophy as \u201csuchnesses.\u201d The\norigins of the proposal have both philosophical and theological\ncomponents. In 1277, the Bishop of Paris, Stephen Tempier, condemned\nthe view that there could not be more than one angel in a given\nspecies. The condemned view was held by Christian Aristotelians in the\nthirteenth century \u2013 pre-eminently, Thomas Aquinas \u2013 and\noriginated in the claim that intra-specific individuation is in some\nsense through different lumps of matter. As immaterial substances,\nangels cannot be individuated in this way. And in any case, as\nimmaterial and non-spatial, angels seem to be good candidates for\npossibly lacking any kind of qualitative difference. Hence, as it is\npossible that two angels be exact replicas of each other, angels are\ngood cases for testing intuitions related to the identity of\nindiscernibles, and thus the question of individuation.\n", "toc": [{"#IndiIdenIndi": "1.

Individuation and the identity of indiscernibles\n\nThe possible existence of such non-qualitative properties as\nexplanations of numerical distinction between substances can perhaps\nbe made plausible by considering a modern equivalent to the medieval\nthought-experiment about angels, namely, the famous counterexample to\nthe identity of indiscernibles suggested by Max Black. A\nwants to defend the principle, and B attack it, and\nB does so by proposing the following case:\n\nIsn\u2019t it logically possible that the universe should have contained\nnothing but two exactly similar spheres? We might suppose that each\nwas made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, that\nthey had the same temperature, colour, and so on, and that nothing\nelse existed. Then every quality and relational characteristic of the\none would also be a property of the other. Now if what I am describing\nis logically possible, it is not impossible for two things to have all\ntheir properties in common. This seems to me to refute the\nprinciple. (Black [1952], 156)\n\n\nClearly, if the identity of indiscernibles is understood \u2013 as\nLeibniz intended \u2013 to assert that any two individuals must\ndiffer in some qualitative or relational way, B\u2019s\ncounterexample seems sufficient to refute it. But it seems that there\nis an easy answer available to A. For A could assert\nthat the two spheres differ in some property or constituent that is\nneither qualitative nor relational: they could differ by\nhaecceity. This leaves intact a trivial reading of Leibniz\n(that if individual x is distinct from individual y,\nthen there must be some property had by x and not by\ny, or vice versa), and thus an apparently true version of the\nprinciple secure. Haecceities may not be the only way to preserve the\nprinciple against B\u2019s counterexample. But the solution gives\nsome prima facie plausibility to the possibility of\nhaecceities. After all, if haecceities are required at least in cases\nof exact replicas, then it seems hard to resist the conclusion that\nthey are responsible for individuation, period.\n\nHere I assume, with Scotus, that a haecceity is a constituent of the\nitem it individuates. I will return later on to theories that make the\nindividuation of particulars primitive. Scotus believes that the\nhaecceity must be a constituent, and the reason is that he grants some\nkind of reality to universals too (common natures, in the technical\nmedieval parlance) \u2013 and that the reality of a common nature\nrequires the reality of the haecceity, and that both be constituents\nof the particular. So, haecceities are bare particulars, but they are\nnot supposed to underlie properties. Some medieval Aristotelians hold\nthat matter, construed as a substrate for forms and properties,\nindividuates; and it would be possible to hold that the individuation\nof a substance is explained by some bare particular that underlies\nproperties. Scotus rejects the view that matter could be responsible\nfor individuation, on the grounds that we require too an explanation\nfor the individuation of (chunks of) matter (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 187 (Scotus [OO],\n7:483; Spade (1994), 106\u2013107)). Neither would Scotus have been\nable to make any sense of a bare particular in the sense of a bare\npossessor of qualities, a view that would doubtless have struck him as\ninconsistent with essentialism (on this, see Park [1990]). Given that\nthe argument for the reality of haecceities (as constituents of\nparticulars) rests on the reality of common natures, we have first to\nprovide an explanation of Scotus\u2019s theory of common natures, followed,\nin a third section, by a description of the theory of haecceity and\nthe relation of these two theories to each other.\n2. Common natures\n\nBuilding on insights gained through the thirteenth century, Scotus\ndistinguishes two closely related issues in individuation: explaining\nhow a particular is such that it cannot be instantiated (explaining\nits individuality, its \u201cindivisibility in itself\u201d), and\nexplaining how a particular is such that it is distinct from other\nparticulars (explaining its \u201cdivision from others\u201d; on\nthis see Park [1988]). The first of these is on the face of it the\nmore complex issue. For various historical reasons, medieval realists\ntend to suppose that common (shared) natures or essences are somehow\ndivided into their instantiations \u2013 as Scotus puts it,\ndivided into \u201csubjective parts.\u201d It is not easy to explain\nprecisely what this divisibility amounts to. Explaining both\ndivisibility and its opposite, Scotus states the problem of\nindividuation as follows:\n\nBecause there is among beings something indivisible into\nsubjective parts \u2013 that is, such that it is formally\nincompatible for it to be divided into several parts each of which is\nit \u2013 the question is not what it is by which such a\ndivision is formally incompatible with it (because it is formally\nincompatible by incompatibility), but rather what it is by which, as\nby a proximate and intrinsic foundation, this incompatibility is in\nit. Therefore, the sense of the questions on this topic [viz. of\nindividuation] is: What is it in [e.g.] this stone, by which as by a\nproximate foundation it is absolutely incompatible with the stone for\nit to be divided into several parts each of which is this stone,\nthe kind of division that is proper to a universal whole as divided\ninto its subjective parts? (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1. q. 2, n. 48 (Scotus [OO], 7:412\u2013413; Spade (1994), 69))\n\n\nI have italicized the relevant portions here. A common nature is\n\u201cdivided into several parts each of which is it.\u201d As\nScotus sees it, individuality and numerical unity or singularity are\nco-extensive. As something that is divisible in the required way, it\nfollows that the nature is not of itself numerically one thing: it has\n\u201cless-than-numerical\u201d unity:\n\nIn the thing [viz. in extramental reality] the nature according to\n[its primary] entity has true real being outside the soul. And\naccording to that entity, it has a unity [viz. less than numerical\nunity] in proportion to it\u2026 . That unity is a proper attribute\nof the nature according to its primary entity. Consequently, the\nnature is intrinsically this neither from itself nor\naccording to its proper unity, which is necessarily included in the\nnature according to its primary entity. (Scotus, Ordinatio\nII, d. 3, p. 1, q. 1, n. 34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404\u2013405; Spade (1994),\n64\u201365))\n\n\nThe basic thought is that a common nature cannot be numerically\nsingular \u2013 if it were, it would be a particular, and the\ndistinction between the common and the particular would simply break\ndown. But it must have some kind of unity, since it has some kind of\nbeing or reality. The result of the relevant kind of division is that\nin some sense the whole common nature is in each instantiation of it.\nBut the whole common nature is not to be understood to be identically\n(numerically) the same in each instantiation, as Scotus makes clear\nelsewhere, and as in any case we might expect, given the part-whole\nlanguage that Scotus uses in the passage just quoted. It seems as\nthough there are both intensional and extensional aspects to the\nnature: intensionally, it is fully in each instantiation, but\nextensionally the nature somehow becomes many on instantiation. (Not\njust: comes to exist in many things, unless this be construed to mean\nthat the nature becomes many when it comes to exist in many things.)\nAt least from an extensional point of view, there is more to humanity\nthan just what is found in me. Another way of thinking about the\nrelevant relation might be to think of natures as in some sense\n\u2018content,\u2019 and each individual as the\n\u2018carrier\u2019 of this content. The nature, as far as its\ncontent is concerned, is fully in each carrier of the content, but is\nmultiplied in its carriers (such that each carrier bears fully the\nsame content, and so the same content becomes many in its carriers,\njust as the content of a book is multiplied in its several\ncopies).\n\nWhy should we accept this sort of account of common natures? Scotus\ndefends it in the context of a rejection of a theory according to\nwhich the singularity of a nature requires no explanation other than\nthe nature itself. The theory is in principle capable of development\nin one of two different directions, and Scotus seems to regard it as a\nmatter of indifference which of these two directions his opponent has\nin mind. One direction is nominalist: there could be individual\nnatures (of the same kind), and each such nature be of itself\nparticular. The other is extreme realist: there could be indivisible\nPlatonic universals, and each such universal be of itself numerically\nsingular. As Scotus sees it, the only way to explain both\ninstantiability and commonality of kind is to posit the existence of\nentities (viz. natures) that are divisible. It is the divisibility of\nthe nature that allows its instantiability, and the unity of the\nnature that explains commonality of kind. Platonism lacks\ninstantiability, and nominalism lacks an explanation for commonality\nof kind. Scotus makes the crucial claim about natures as follows:\n\nAnything with a real, proper, and sufficient unity less than numerical\nis not of itself one by numerical unity \u2013 that is, it is not of\nitself a this. But the proper, real or sufficient unity of\nthe nature existing in this stone is less than numerical unity.\nTherefore [the nature existing in this stone is not of itself one by\nnumerical unity]. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 2, p. 1, q. 1, n.\n8 (Scotus [OO], 7:395; Spade (1994), 59))\n\n\nHere the premises speak of Scotus\u2019s \u201cless than numerical\nunity,\u201d the unity of something that is divisible into\nnumerically many subjective parts. Scotus provides a total of seven\narguments in favor of the minor premise \u2013 in favor, in other\nwords, of the position that there is something with\nless-than-numerical unity. Four of these appeal to Aristotelian\nauthority, and of these the third is most interesting:\n\nAccording to the Philosopher, Metaphysics V, the chapter on\nrelation [c. 15, 1021a9\u201312], the same, the similar\nand the equal are all based on the notion of one, so that even though\na similarity has for its foundation a thing in the genus of quality,\nnevertheless such a relation is not real unless it has a real\nfoundation and a real proximate basis for the founding. Therefore, the\nunity required in the foundation of the relation of similarity is a\nreal one. But it is not numerical unity, since nothing one and the\nsame is similar or equal to itself. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d.\n3, p. 1, q. 1, n. 18 (Scotus [OO], 7:398; Spade (1994), 61))\n\n\nThe point is that relations of similarity between two particulars\ncannot be self-explanatory; they must have some explanation (some\n\u201creal foundation\u201d) in the things that are similar. This is\namongst other things an argument against resemblance nominalism. But\nit is also supposed to be an argument against the view that a common\nnature could be numerically identical in each instantiation. As Paul\nVincent Spade helpfully comments in loc. (ftnt. 8), \u201cfor\nmediaeval authors \u2026 a thing x is not (qualitatively)\nsimilar to itself \u2026 but just has a quality.\u201d\nSimilarity between different instances of the same kind requires that\nthey have less-than-numerical unity.\n\nOf the arguments from reason (rather than from the authority of\nAristotle), one particularly focuses on a claim with which Ockham\nwill, a few years later, sharply disagree:\n\nIf every real unity is numerical unity, then every real diversity is\nnumerical diversity. The consequent is false. For every numerical\ndiversity, in so far as it is numerical, is equal. And so all things\nwould be equally distinct. In that case, it follows that the intellect\ncould not abstract something common from Socrates and Plato any more\nthan it could from Socrates and a line. Every universal would be a\npure figment of the intellect. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 1, n. 23 (Scotus [OO], 7:400\u2013401; Spade (1994), 62))\n\n\nThe obvious claim here is supposed to be that not all real diversity\nis numerical, and Scotus supports it by arguing that, if the only way\nin which things differed were numerical, then all things would be\nequally distinct. But there are degrees of diversity: Socrates and\nPlato are not distinguished in species, for example. Unity and\ndiversity here are inter-definable contradictories, so it is not the\ncase that every real unity is numerical unity.\n\nThe reason that the common nature has some kind of entity is that the\nnature is supposed to be subject to the accidental modification of\nexisting as this or that particular, and it is not possible for the\nsubject of a real modification not itself to be real:\n\nAlthough it [viz. the nature] is never without some of these features\n[viz. being in extramental particulars or being thought of], yet it is\nnot any of them of itself, but is naturally prior to all of them.\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 1, n. 32 (Scotus [OO],\n7:403; Spade (1994), 63))\n\n\nSo in order to possess in itself this non-numerical unity, the nature\nmust have, in itself, some sort of being too, proportional to it (such\nthat the real entity of the nature is diminished in proportion to the\ndiminished real unity that it has). Scotus does not mean that the\nnature is some sort of universal ante rem; if there were no\ninstantiations, there would be no nature, but once there are\ninstantiations there is too some subject for instantiation (the\nnature), and this subject has some sort of being in itself. Indeed,\nthis subject is in some sense prior (but not temporally prior) to its\ninstantiations: while the identity of its instantiations depends on\nit, its identity does not depend on those of its instantiations. (It\nmakes no difference to the identity of human nature whether or not I\nexist, though the reality of human nature certainly requires that at\nleast one human being exist: see Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 1, n. 34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404; Spade (1994), 64).) As\ninstantiated, the nature receives the (accidental) modification of\nbeing numerically many in numerically many things.\n\nMuch of the account of common natures can be found in nuce in\nAquinas\u2019s De ente et essentia. But Scotus\u2019s account is\nusually thought to diverge from Aquinas\u2019s in at least one crucial way.\nAccording to both Scotus and Aquinas \u2013 following some\nsuggestions in Avicenna \u2013 it is possible to consider a nature in\nitself, abstracting both from its existence as a universal concept and\nas the particulars into which it is divided. (Hence Avicenna\u2019s famous\nslogan \u201cequinity is just equinity\u201d: Avicenna, Liber de\nscientia divina, V, c. 1 (Avicenna [LPP], 2:228\u2013229).)\nAquinas is clear that this bare nature lacks numerical unity (see\nAquinas, De ente et essentia, c. 3 (Aquinas [DEE],\n24\u201325)), and it seems that it lacks any kind of entity too. So\nwhere Scotus ascribes to the nature a kind of entity, and unity short\nof numerical unity, Aquinas does neither. It is perhaps worth noting,\nin passing, that a plausible case can be made for tracing this\nmoderate sort of realism on the question of universals to the\nAristotelian tradition (specifically, Alexander of Aphrodisias: see\nTweedale [1993]). One might also argue, as his famous commentator\nCajetan did, that Aquinas would be willing to attribute some sort of\nunity and proportionally some sort of being to the absolutely\nconsidered nature. For Cajetan\u2019s exposition of the issue, carefully\ndistinguishing Aquinas\u2019s from Scotus\u2019s position, and for useful\nreferences to both authors, see Cajetan [CBE], c. 4 (nn. 55\u201362),\npp. 134\u2013155. Scotus, while clearly in this same tradition,\nevidently considers the sort of account found in Aquinas to be\ninsufficient, and thus is more clearly to be placed in the realist\ncamp than Aquinas on this question. Far from holding that the nature\nin itself lacks any kind of reality, Scotus holds that the primary\nreality of the nature belongs to the nature in itself.\n3. Haecceity in Duns Scotus\n\nCommon natures have non-numerical unity, and are thus in the relevant\nsense divisible. As Scotus sees it, the fundamental issue to be\nexplained by haecceity is that of indivisibility: what is it about\nindividuals that makes them indivisible into subjective parts, in\ncontrast to the divisibility of the common nature:\n\nI explain what I understand by individuation or numerical unity or\nsingularity: Certainly not the indeterminate unity by which anything\nin a species is said to be one in number. Rather, I mean designated\nunity as a this, so that just as it was said above that an\nindividual is incompossible with being divided into subjective parts\nand the reason for that incompossibility is asked there, so too I say\nhere that an individual is incompossible with not being a designated\nthis by this singularity and the cause is asked not of\nsingularity in general but of this designated singularity in\nparticular \u2013 that is, as it is determinately this.\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 76 (Scotus [OO],\n7:426\u2013427; Spade (1994), 76); see too q. 2, n. 48 [Scotus\n(1950\u2013), 7:412\u2013413]; qq. 5\u20136, n. 165 (Scotus [OO],\n7:473))\n\n\nThe point is not just that an account of numerical singularity in\ngeneral is required (the \u201cindeterminate unity by which anything\nin a species is said to be one in number\u201d). What is required,\nrather, is an account of the individuality of any given particular,\nand this account will explain its being indivisible into subjective\nparts. (Scotus does not use the term \u2018haecceity\u2019\n[haecceitas] in the work that I am using here \u2013 the\nOrdinatio. He talks rather about the individual difference,\nor individual entity. But he does elsewhere talk about this entity as\na haecceitas [a term of Scotus\u2019s own invention]: for the\nchange in terminology, see Dumont [1995]).\n\nDivisibility into subjective parts, of course, is on the face of it\nvery different from the question of division from all other things, so\nnicely exemplified in Black\u2019s example of the qualitatively identical\nspheres. Scotus\u2019s assumption, however, is that both questions can be\nanswered in the same way. Thus Scotus supposes that the explanation\nfor distinction is the explanation for indivisibility, and the rough\noutline of what he is thinking looks as follows. The explanation for\ndistinction is primary, in the sense that what distinction needs is\nexplanation by items (haecceities) that are irreducibly numerically\ndistinct from each other \u2013 as Scotus puts it, \u201cprimarily\ndiverse\u201d (primo diversa) \u2013 and have nothing real\nwhatever in common: \u201cthey agree in nothing the same\u201d\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 186\n(Scotus [OO], 7:483; Spade (1994), 106)). (This does not entail that\nthe things thus distinguished, as opposed to the haecceities that\ndistinguish these things, have nothing whatever in common.\nScotus\u2019s point is that the haecceity is needed as a constituent\nof a being that shares its nature with something else in the manner\ndescribed in the previous section.) According to Scotus, merely\nnumerical distinction \u2013 as opposed to (say) specific distinction\n\u2013 entails that each of the things distinguished has numerical\nsingularity. And numerical singularity entails indivisibility (into\nsubjective parts), for what allows a common nature to be divided (into\nsubjective parts) is its possession of less-than-numerical unity.\n\nThe claim that the explanations for indivisibility and distinction are\nthe same gains some plausibility from an analogy with the distinction\nbetween different specific differences in relation to a genus \u2013\nan analogue that Scotus evidently regards as less controversial, and\nmore familiar to his readers. A specific difference distinguishes two\ndifferent species of a genus from each other. A specific difference is\nsomething indivisible in such a way that is explanatory of a species\u2019s\nindivisibility into further species (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d.\n3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 177 (Scotus [OO], 7:478; Spade (1994),\n103\u2013104)). Equally, an ultimate specific difference is\n\u201cprimarily diverse\u201d from any other, in the sense that such\na specific difference \u201chas a concept that is absolutely\nsimple\u201d (and thus cannot even overlap with the concept of any\nother such difference) (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq.\n5\u20136, n. 183 (Scotus [OO], 7:481; Spade (1994), 105)). It does\nnot seem overly puzzling that a specific difference could perform\nthese two functions: the absolute conceptual simplicity of any\nultimate specific difference seems to entail both distinction from\nevery other specific difference, and its possessing the relevant sort\nof indivisibility. And Scotus believes that these sorts of\nconsideration can help explicate the function of a haecceity relative\nto individuation too. That is to say, he believes that something\nwholly devoid of common (shared) content \u2013 a haecceity \u2013\ncan explain not only indivisibility into further particulars, but also\ndistinction from all other particulars (Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 177 (Scotus [OO], 7:478; Spade (1994),\n103\u2013104); n. 183 (Scotus [OO], 7:481; Spade (1994), 105)).\n\nSo Scotus holds that the explanations for indivisibility and\ndistinction are the same. To understand why he supposes that this\nexplanation needs to be something real, we need to keep in mind his\naccount of the reality of common natures, outlined in the previous\nsection, for the reality of common natures is a premise in\nScotus\u2019s defense of the existence of haecceities. Since such\nnatures are real, Scotus reasons, the haecceities that tie such\nnatures to individuals must be equally real too:\n\nJust as unity in common follows per se on some entity in\ncommon, so too does any unity follow per se on some entity or\nother. Therefore, absolute unity (like the unity of an individual\n\u2026 that is, a unity with which division into several subjective\nparts is incompatible and with which not being a designated\nthis is incompatible), if it is found in beings (as every\ntheory assumes), follows per se on some per se\nentity. But it does not follow per se on the entity of the\nnature, because that has a certain per se real unity of its\nown, as was proved\u2026. Therefore, it follows on some other entity\nthat determines this one. And that other entity makes up something\nper se one with the entity of the nature, because the whole\nto which this unity belongs is perfect of itself. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 169 (Scotus [OO],\n7:474\u2013475; Spade (1994), 101))\n\n\nAnd later Scotus notes that it \u201cdoes not seem probable\u201d\nthat the common nature has some kind of entity and yet that the\nindividuating feature does not. (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 178 (Scotus [OO], 7:478\u2013479; Spade\n(1994), 104))\n\nScotus elsewhere considers the view of Henry of Ghent that the\nexplanation for individuation could be merely a negation. The point\nabout a negation is that it is not in any way real: it is not\na thing, or a real form or property of a thing. As Scotus sees it,\nclaiming that individuation could be by a negation is just a way of\nrestating the problem, not of proposing an explanatory solution to it\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 2, n. 49 (Scotus [OO],\n7:413; Spade (1994), 69)). In fact, Scotus takes himself to have not\nmerely an explanation for individuation, but also an explanation for\nidentity. The contrast with modern accounts of haecceities is thus\nquite sharp. In much modern literature, an item\u2019s haecceity is simply\nthe primitive property of being that item, or being identical with\nthat item. For Scotus, the haecceity is supposed to explain\nthat property. (See further discussion of this in section 6\nbelow.)\n\nSupposing that a haecceity is something real, where does it fit into\nthe range of things that there are? Is it, for example, a form, or\nsomething else? According to Scotus, it is something like a form, and\nsometimes, indeed, he calls it such (while elsewhere denying the same\nclaim: on these insignificant terminological shifts, see Dumont\n[1995]). The reason is that a haecceity is clearly something like a\nproperty of a thing \u2013 hence like a form \u2013 but is at the\nsame time wholly devoid of any correspondence to any conceptual\ncontents. It is not at all a qualitative feature of a thing \u2013\nnot at all a \u201cquidditative\u201d feature, in the technical\nvocabulary. As irreducibly particular, it shares no real feature in\ncommon with any other thing. This does not mean that haecceities\ncannot fall under the extension of a concept. Being an\nindividuating feature is not a real property of a haecceity (it\ncannot be, since any haecceity is wholly simple, and shares no real\nfeatures with any other thing); but any concept of what a haecceity is\ncertainly includes among its components being an individuating\nfeature. A concept of a haecceity includes representations merely\nof logical, not real, features of any haecceity.\n\nScotus\u2019s position on the reality of both the nature and the haecceity\nseems to raise a number of problems. Perhaps the most acute \u2013 a\nproblem which Scotus himself raises \u2013 is this:\n\nIf there is some real unity less than numerical unity, it belongs to\nsomething that is either in what is numerically the same or in\nsomething else. Not in what is numerically the same, because whatever\nis numerically the same is numerically one. Neither is it in two,\nbecause there is nothing really one in those two. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 171 (Scotus [OO],\n7:476; Spade (1994), 102))\n\n\nThis is what has come to be known as Ockham\u2019s problem (see King\n[1992], 51): how can the nature as instantiated retain its\nnon-numerical unity? Scotus\u2019s apparent solution is that the nature in\nitself has non-numerical unity, but that as existent in particulars it\nhas, in each particular, numerical unity. Scotus thus \u2013\nconsistent with his basic insight \u2013 believes that the nature has\ntwo different sorts of extramental entity:\n\nIn the same item that is one in number there is some kind of entity\nfrom which there follows a unity less than numerical unity is. Such\nunity [viz. less-than-numerical] is real, and what such unity belongs\nto is of itself formally one by numerical unity. I grant therefore\nthat this real unity [viz. less-than-numerical] does not belong to\nanything existing in two individuals, but in one. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 172 (Scotus [OO],\n7:476; Spade (1994), 102))\n\n\nScotus explains his position by exploiting the analogy between a\nhaecceity or individual difference, and a specific difference:\n\nColor in whiteness is specifically one, but it is not so of itself or\nper se or primarily but only denominatively. But a specific\ndifference is primarily one, because it is primarily incompatible with\nit to be divided into what are several in species. Whiteness is\nspecifically one per se but not primarily, because it is\nspecifically one through something intrinsic to it (for example,\nthrough the difference). So I grant that whatever is in this stone is\nnumerically one, either primarily or per se or\ndenominatively. Primarily, say, as that through which such a unity\nbelongs to this composite. Per se, the stone itself, of which\nwhat is primarily one with this unity is a per se part. Only\ndenominatively, what is potential and is perfected by the actual and\nis so to speak denominatively related to its actuality. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, nn. 174\u2013175\n(Scotus [OO], 7:477\u2013478; Spade (1994), 103))\n\n\nThere are three things here: the nature in the particular, the\nhaecceity, and the particular itself. Each of these is numerically one\n(and thus numerically distinct from the corrrelative items in any\nother particular). The haecceity is \u2018primarily\u2019 numerically one,\nbecause its numerical unity is a basic feature of its. The particular\nis per se numerically one because it includes the component\nin virtue of which it is numerically one. The nature in the particular\nis denominatively numerically one. Denominative predication obtains in\nthe case that the predicate is true of the subject as the result of\nthe subject\u2019s possession of some further, accidental, feature. Thus,\nqualifying the predication as \u201cdenominative\u201d in this way\ndoes not make the predication any less real. Being accidentally\nnumerically one is a case of being numerically one, not of being\nnon-numerically one, and what Scotus is really trying to say is that\nthe nature in this particular is indeed really (though\naccidentally) numerically one. Note that the denominative numerical\nsingularity of the nature in the particular is still compatible with\nthe common nature\u2019s being numerically one in some other particular,\nand this is because the nature in itself (not as in this or that\nparticular) is less-than-numerically one (Scotus, Ordinatio\nII, d. 3, p. 1, q. 1, n. 34 (Scotus [OO], 7:404\u2013405; Spade (1994),\n64)).\n\nBeing non-numerically one, then, is compatible with being accidentally\nnumerically one in any one instantiation. But a problem immediately\narises: is being non-numerically one compatible with being\naccidentally numerically many in many instantiations? On the one hand,\nthinking this seems a natural way of understanding the theory, given\nits realist character; on the other, we have just seen Scotus deny\nthat this kind of unity belongs \u201cto anything existing in two\nindividuals.\u201d Perhaps we should say that the nature is really in\nmany individuals, but does not \u201cexist\u201d in many individuals,\nsince existence is precisely a property of concrete particulars.\nElsewhere, indeed, Scotus draws an analogy with the Christian doctrine\nof the Trinity, according to which there is numerically one nature\nshared by three distinct persons (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3,\np. 1, q. 1, n. 39 (Scotus [OO], 7:408; Spade (1994), 44)). And this\nsuggests, contrariwise, that just as something numerically one is in\nthree persons, so something with less-than-numerical unity is in many\nindividuals. Perhaps there are just no principled rules for counting\nitems with less-than-numerical unity. (For an excellent discussion of\nsome of these problems, see Paasch (2014).)\n\nWe run into an analogous problem with the question of the common\nnature\u2019s entity. Scotus persistently refuses to reduce it to the\nentity of the particulars to which it belongs: as we saw in the\nprevious section, this entity \u201chas true real being outside the\nsoul.\u201d But it nevertheless somehow belongs to the entity of the\nparticulars: as we have just seen, \u201cSuch unity [viz.\nless-than-numerical] is real, and what such unity belongs to is of\nitself formally one by numerical unity.\u201d Setting aside the\nparticular and the haecceity, we might wonder how many entities there\nare. Perhaps the entity of the common nature is nothing over and above\nthe entity of the nature in the particular. But perhaps not. So it\nseems to me that it is hard to come to an assessment of the strength\nof Scotus\u2019s realism, since it is hard to come to an appraisal of his\nview on the reality of the common nature.\n\nI have spoken about consituents in this context: the nature in the\nparticular and the haecceity are in effect constituents of the\nparticular. So there must be some kind of distinction between them.\nThis distinction cannot be real, since according to Scotus real\ndistinction requires separability, and the features are not separable\nfrom each other any more than they are separable from themselves.\nNeither are they anything like discrete parts of some whole. They are,\nas Scotus puts it, \u201cformally distinct\u201d:\n\nThis individual entity is not matter or form of the composite,\ninasmuch as each of these is a nature. Rather, it is the ultimate\nreality of the being that is matter or that is form or that is the\ncomposite. Thus whatever is common and yet determinable can still be\ndistinguished (no matter how much it is one thing) into several\nformally distinct realities of which this one is not formally that\none. This one is formally the entity of singularity and that one is\nformally the entity of the nature. These two realities cannot be\ndistinguished as thing and thing. \u2026 Rather\nwhen in the same thing, whether in a part or in the whole, they are\nalways formally distinct realities of the same thing. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 188 (Scotus [OO],\n7:483\u2013484; Spade (1994), 107))\n\n\nThe formal distinction in this context is fundamentally a way of\ndistinguishing the necessary properties of a particular substance, in\ncases where the natures of which the substances are instantiations are\nnot coextensive. Given this, what sort of relation \u201cties\u201d\nthese two formally distinct components together? Scotus suggests that\nthis relation is real (i.e. numerical) sameness, a kind of unity\nfalling short of absolute identity (Scotus, Ordinatio I, d.\n2, p. 2, qq. 1\u20134, n. 403 (Scotus [OO], 2:356)). This sameness is\npresumably something rather like the relation of compresence found in\nRussell and others, though unlike compresence, real sameness is not\nonly symmetrical but also transitive (see Tweedale [1999],\n2:463\u2013464). Scotus is able to claim transitivity for the\nrelation of real sameness since, as we have seen, he believes that the\ncommon nature instantiated in two distinct particulars does not itself\nhave real (i.e. numerical) identity (see Tweedale [1999], 488). The\nhaeeceity and the nature in the particular can thus be really the same\nwithout different concrete particulars of the same kind being really\nthe same as each other.\n\nWhat should we say about the indiscernibility of identicals in these\nkinds of case (real identity, formal distinction)? Haecceities explain\nthe identity of the complete concrete objects that they compose. So\ncomplete concrete objects have self-identity. So too does each of the\nformalities that compose such a concrete object. But these formalities\nare discernible from each other. Real sameness falls short of absolute\nidentity. (I discuss some of these issues, and others related to the\nvarieties of distinction in Scotus, in Cross [2019].)\n\nGiven the huge problems that an account of haecceities seems to raise,\nit is worth seeing just why Scotus believes he needs to accept this\nview of individuation as opposed to a rival one. Scotus defends\nhaecceities by rejecting all alternative theories of individuation\nknown to him. Rejecting qualitative theories is easy for the\nscholastics. Suppose that all things of a given kind in some sense\nshare the same nature. The nature as such cannot explain\nindividuation. So the explanation must be somehow non-essential. But\nnon-essential qualitative or accidental features of a thing are\nposterior to the thing itself, since although the substance must have\nsome accidental features, precisely which ones it has is a matter of\nhistorical chance (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n.\n87 (Scotus [OO], 7:432\u2013433; Spade (1994), 79)). Things are not\nidentical with their life-stories (on this, see Cross [1999b]).\nIndeed, Scotus goes so far as to suggest that the accidents of a\nsubstance \u2013 at least, its quantities, qualities, and relations\n\u2013 are individuated by their own haecceities, something that is\nnot often spotted in the commentaries (on this, see Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 89 (Scotus [OO], 7:434;\nSpade (1994), 79\u201380)). The great 17th century Scotist, John\nPoncius, extends this claim to cover even so-called propria,\nnecessary but non-defining properties: paradigmatically, a capacity to\nsmile in human beings (see Poncius, Disputatio Metaphysica\nVI, q. 9 [Poncius (1659), 138b]).\n\nBut this far from exhausts the options, and Scotus considers a number\nof non-qualitative theories too. In addition to the two theories\ndiscussed above, to the effect that things just are individuals\n(either through the nature itself, or through the negation of\ndivision), he considers a view according to which existence\nindividuates, and two views according to which the explanation for\nindividuation is matter, respectively matter as such, and matter +\nextension. Actual existence, perhaps a prima facie plausible\nnon-qualitative or non-essential feature of a thing, is rejected by\nScotus as an individuator on the grounds that existence as such\n\u2013 as opposed to the things that exist \u2013 does not seem to\nbe different from case to case: in itself, it seems wholly\nundifferentiated (Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 3, n.\n61 (Scotus [OO], 7:418\u2013419; Spade (1994), 72\u201373)). Nothing\nabout existence seems irreducibly particular in the way required.\nIndeed, Scotus supposes that there is a sense in which existence is\nposterior to the haecceity: the whole hierarchy of division into\nindividuals is antecedent to questions of those individuals\u2019 existence\n(Scotus, Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q, 3, n. 65 (Scotus [OO],\n7:420; Spade (1994), 73\u201374). But that is another story.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting non-qualitative approach is the theory,\noften associated with Aquinas (but attacked by Scotus in the forms\npresented by Godfrey of Fontaines and Giles of Rome), that\nindividuation is by extended matter: by, as we might say,\nchunks of matter. Scotus\u2019s way of understanding the problem\nof individuation becomes important in his rejection of this theory.\nFor his fundamental strategy against this sort of material\nindividuation is that such a theory, while it may be able to explain\nnumerical distinction, certainly cannot explain indivisibility:\n\nQuantity is not the reason for divisibility into individuals\u2026.\nFor a universal whole, which is divided into individuals and into\nsubjective parts, is predicated of each of those subjective parts in\nsuch a way that each subjective part is it. But the quantitative parts\ninto which a continuous whole is divided never admit of the\npredication of the whole that is divided into them. (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, n. 106 (Scotus [OO], 7:443;\nSpade (1994), 85))\n\n\n(The \u2018whole\u2019 here is not water as such, taking \u2018water\u2019 as a mass term;\nit is the individual body of water, with which no proper part of the\nbody is identical.) Scotus has other arguments too, most notably\nvariants of the theme that the same chunk of matter (matter +\nextension) seems to persist through substantial change, and thus not\nto be sufficient as an account of individuation (see Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q. 4, nn. 77\u201381 (Scotus [OO],\n7:427\u2013429; Spade (1994), 77)). Individuation on Scotus\u2019s\nview is not, fundamentally, a case of instantiating forms in\n matter\n\n4. Later medieval and early modern accounts of haecceities\n\nAcceptance of haecceities is a distinctive feature of the thought of\nmany followers of Scotus, though there are some sixteenth-century\nscholastics who accept haecceities without accepting many other\ndistinctively Scotist teachings. Having said this, some early\nfollowers of Scotus reject haecceities and the theory of the common\nnature altogether, and of those who accept haecceities, some found the\ncorrect understanding of the nature of the distinction between an\nindividual\u2019s nature and its haecceity a troublesome matter. One of the\nearliest Scotists, Francis of Meyronnes, writing his commentary on the\nSentences around 1320, accepts the theory of the\nnon-numerical unity of common natures (In Sent. II, d. 34, q.\n3 [Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157rbG]), and the claim\nthat individuation is by haecceity (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 157vaK-L]; I, d. 3, q. 4\n[Francis of Meyronnes (1520), 18raA]). But he holds that it\nis inappropriate to talk of a formal distinction in this context.\nFormal distinction obtains only between things that have some sort of\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48vbQ-49raB]). Haecceities have no such\nquidditative content (In Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520),\n48rbG]), and thus cannot be formally distinct from their\nnature. Rather, a haecceity is modally distinct from its\nnature (In Sent. II, d. 34, q. 3 [(1520),\n157vaL]). A modal distinction, according to Meyronnes,\nobtains between a thing and an intrinsic mode of that thing, where an\nintrinsic mode is something which \u201cwhen added to a thing does\nnot vary its formal definition \u2026 since it does not of itself\nimply any quiddity or formal definition\u201d (In Sent. I,\nd. 42, q. 3 [(1520), 120vaL; 120vbO]; see too\nIn Sent. I, d. 8, q. 5 [(1520), 49rbE]). A\nhaecceity does not affect a thing\u2019s kind; it is thus an\nintrinsic mode of the thing.\n\nIt may look as though this is just a terminological shift, but it is\nnot so in at least the following way: a modal distinction is a lesser\nkind of distinction than a formal distinction. Formal distinctions\nobtain between genus and specific difference; thus, the difference\nbetween species/nature and haecceity, for Meyronnes, is less than the\ndifference between genus and difference. Scotus, contrariwise, makes\nno such distinction between degrees of difference in this context (for\nthis contrast between the two thinkers, see Dumont [1987], 18). Still,\nwithout some principled way of spelling out degrees of difference,\nthis contrast between Scotus and Meyronnes amounts to nothing of any\nphilosophical interest. To this extent the difference between the two\nthinkers might as well be merely terminological, and Meyronnes needs\nto do more work if he is to make any significant philosophical point\nhere.\n\nAmongst baroque scholastics, the most notable adherent of haecceities\nis the Jesuit Peter Fonseca (1528\u20131599), whose monumental\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Fonseca [1599])\nincludes an extensive discussion of haecceities. (Fonseca, with\nsomething of a humanist background, worries about the barbarous nature\nof Scotus\u2019s neologism, and suggests in passing that \u2018haeccity\u2019\n[haeccitas] would have been a more comfortable formulation\n[In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 1 (Fonseca [1599], vol. 2, col.\n381D)] \u2013 compare \u2018quiddity.\u2019) Like many of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth-century scholastics, Fonseca \u2013 most\nnotable for coming up with a theory of divine \u201cmiddle\nknowledge\u201d at much the same time as Molina \u2013 is not a\nfollower of any one earlier philosopher, preferring to learn from any\nof his predecessors on various points as he sees fit. According to\nFonseca,\n\nthe principle of individuation is a certain positive difference,\nprimarily incommunicable, which, when added to the species, in itself\nconstitutes the individual \u2026 which difference others call\nhaecceities. (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 1\n[Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 181C-D])\n\n\nFonseca engages particularly with the rejection of haecceities in the\nThomist Cajetan (most notably in Cajetan\u2019s commentary on Aquinas\u2019s\nDe ente, c. 2, q. 5, nn. 33\u201336 (Cajetan [CBE],\n94\u201398)). Cajetan worries that haecceities need to be in some\nsense similar to each other \u2013 and specifically that the\nhaecceities of Socrates and Plato must be more similar than the\nhaecceities of Plato and some white patch (Cajetan, In de\nente, c. 2, q. 5, n. 36 (Cajetan [CBE], 97); see Fonseca, In\nMet. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n185C-D]). According to Fonseca, haecceities are similar to each other\nwithout having anything real in common: they are thus primarily\ndiverse in the required sense, even though the haecceities of Socrates\nand Plato are more similar than the haecceities of Plato and some\nwhite patch (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca\n(1599), vol. 2, col. 185E-F]). More generally, Fonseca (rightly) holds\nthat exact similarity between two haecceities would entail that the\ntwo haecceities were numerically identical (Fonseca, In Met.\nV, c. 6, q. 5, sect. 2 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 185B]).\n\nFonseca is convinced of the reality of haecceities because he accepts\nthe view that common natures have in themselves a certain sort of\nunity prior to instantiation. Fonseca proposes that, in order to have\nreal existence, something needs to be added to the nature \u2013 a\nhaecceity (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca\n(1599), vol. 2, col. 966A]). Again, Fonseca\u2019s discussion is informed\nby the criticisms of Cajetan, though in this case the position that\nCajetan adopts on the question of the unity of the common\nnature seems closer to the broadly Thomist and Scotist tradition than\nthat proposed by Fonseca. In other words, Fonseca adopts an account of\nthe common nature that seems quite distinct from the closely related\nviews of Aquinas and Scotus. To this extent, Fonseca\u2019s account\nrepresents an acceptance of haecceities in the context of a theory of\nuniversals that is not really Scotist. According to Cajetan, common\nnatures in themselves have \u201cformal\u201d unity: indivisibility\ninto further more specific kinds, compatible with division into\nnumerically many instances or subjective parts (Cajetan [CBE], nn.\n134\u2013155 [nn. 55\u201362]; see Fonseca, In Met. V, c.\n28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 967B, D-E]). Fonseca\nagrees that the nature must have this formal unity \u2013 a unity\nthat he identifies as Scotus\u2019s less-than-numerical unity (Fonseca,\nIn Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n968A]). But, in addition to this unity, he holds that the nature has a\nproper unity of its own that cannot be communicated to its\ninstantiations. This unity is numerical, and belongs to the\nnature absolutely (unqualifiedly) (Fonseca, In Met. V, c. 28,\nq. 3, sect. 4 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col. 968A]). The reason is\nthat, if a nature lacked such additional unity, then it would not be\npossible to speak of (say) humanity as just one species. After all,\nthe formal unity of the nature is compatible with division into\nnumerically many instances; some other unity must be the basis for the\nassertion that humanity is not many natures or species (Fonseca,\nIn Met. V, c. 28, q. 3, sect. 1 [Fonseca (1599), vol. 2, col.\n959F]). The picture is admittedly not entirely clear, but Fonseca\u2019s\ndistinction of instantiable from non-instantiable unity is presumably\nsupposed to explain how there can be some unity proper to common\nnatures; this unity is distinguished from instantiable unity, and it\nis the existence of haecceities that explains how the instantiable\nunity is in fact instantiated.\n5. Rejecting haecceities\n\nSetting aside the complexities of a later thinker such as Fonseca, the\nyears immediately after Scotus saw something of a move towards a more\nnominalist view on the question of universals \u2013 the view (on the\nunderstanding of \u2018nominalism\u2019 relevant here) that\nuniversals are just concepts. Amongst opponents of Scotus, the most\ncommon strategy was to adopt the view that substances themselves are\nprimarily diverse, such that their distinction is not explained by any\nreal feature or property of them other than merely the substance\nitself. For example, according to Peter Auriol writing in the decade\nafter Scotus\u2019 death,\n\nobjects are singular by themselves, and \u2026 this singularity is a\nbasic fact that needs no further explanation\u2026. Maintaining that\nan object is singular or individual because it results from or is\nendowed with a proper principle of individuation which is itself\nsingular, amounts to nothing more than duplicating what should be\nexplained. (Nielsen [2003], 498)\n\n\nPrimitive distinction must occur somewhere \u2013 so why not make it\nat the level of the substance itself, rather than of some constituent\nof the substance? Rejection of Scotus\u2019s view was not confined to such\nmanifest opponents of Scotus\u2019s system. Amongst the earliest students\nof Scotus, various found his views on the haecceity and its formal\ndistinction from the nature unpalatable. William of Alnwick, the\nforemost of Scotus\u2019s students working through the second decade of the\nfourteenth century, holds at least two different positions, neither\nthe same as Scotus\u2019s. In an early disputed question on individuation,\nWilliam holds that natures are individual of themselves (Stella\n[1968], 363); later, in his Ordinatio on the\nSentences, William accepts something akin to Henry of Ghent\u2019s\nposition that individuation is by a negation, though adding the\nclarification that this negation represents nevertheless a perfection\n\u2013 it is better not to have the positive feature of divisibility\n(Stella [1968], 630\u2013631). The reason for the shift in view is an\napprehension that the fact that natures can be multiplied (i.e.\nexemplified many times) entails that a nature cannot be\nself-individuating (Stella [1968], 628). But William cannot see how\nthe added feature could be anything positive, since he does not see\nhow an individual could be anything, necessarily, other than its\nnature (Stella [1968], 631). In both works, William objects to\nScotus\u2019s view that the common nature is somehow prior to its\ninstantiations, on the grounds that this priority entails that the\ncommon nature could exist without any of its instantiations (Stella\n[1968], 352, 625). This in effect amounts \u2013 in Scotist terms\n\u2013 to the claim that the nature is really distinct, not just\nformally distinct, from any of its instantiations. For Scotus, the\nmark of a formal distinction is inseparability: no individual is\nseparable from its nature, and there is thus no more than a formal\ndistinction in any individual between nature and haecceity. Ockham\nputs his finger on this misinterpretation on the part of Alnwick:\n\nOn this question there is one theory attributed by some people [viz.\nWilliam of Alnwick] to the Subtle Doctor [i.e. Scotus] \u2026. This\nis the theory that the universal is a true being outside the soul,\nreally distinct from a contracting difference but really multiplied\nand varied by such a contracting difference. (Ockham,\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, q. 5, n. 6 (William of Ockham [OT], 2:154,\nll. 1\u20132, 3\u20137; Spade (1994), 149))\n\n\nAs Ockham rightly implies, this is not Scotus\u2019s view. A position not\ndissimilar to William\u2019s earlier, nominalist, view can be found in\nanother prominent early student of Scotus\u2019s \u2013 Henry of Harclay\n(see Henninger [1994]; for Ockham\u2019s rejection of the way in which\nHarclay develops his nominalist theory, see Ockham, Ordinatio\nI, d. 2, q. 7, nn. 11\u201312, 63\u201382 (William of Ockham [OT],\n2:227, l. 15\u2013p. 228, l. 20, p. 241, l. 21\u2013p. 248, l. 21;\nSpade (1994), 191\u2013192, 200\u2013204); see too Adams\n[1982]).\n\nOckham himself, writing 1321\u20131323, raises an array of arguments\nagainst Scotus\u2019s position. Ockham was a thinker explicitly influenced\nby Scotus in all sorts of ways, while nevertheless rejecting the\nfundamental feature of Scotist metaphysics and semantics, namely\nrealism on the question of common natures. Without exception, the\narguments target one of the following two Scotist positions: the\ncommonality of the nature, and the formal distinction. As such, Ockham\ndoes not attack haecceities, though in so far as Scotus\u2019s account of\nhaecceities requires both his distinctive account of the divisibility\nof a nature, and the formal distinction between nature and haecceity,\nOckham\u2019s attacks will harm Scotus\u2019s haecceities too. Ockham offers no\nfewer than four arguments against common natures with less than\nnumerical unity (Ockham, Ordinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, nn. 51, 62,\n78, 82 (William of Ockham [OT], 2:181, ll. 8\u201313, p. 184, ll.\n11\u201313, p. 189, ll. 10\u201314, p. 190, ll. 18\u201322; Spade\n(1994), 161, 163, 166, 167)). The key one is the second: humanity in\nSocrates and humanity in Plato are numerically distinct, and\nessentially so. So there is nothing in common between these\nhumanities. Ockham\u2019s first and longest argument against Scotus takes\nissue with the formal distinction. Against the formal distinction of\nreally identical entities, Ockham persistently appeals to the\nindiscernibility of identicals, arguing that there is no kind of\nidentity mid-way between real identity and real distinction: see\nOckham, Ordinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, nn. 25\u20138, 83 (William\nof Ockham [OT], 2:173, l. 11\u2013p. 174, l. 12, p. 190, l. 23\u2013p.\n191, l. 4; Spade (1994), 118, 127)). As Marilyn Adams has pointed out,\nthis strategy seems to beg the question against Scotus (Adams [1982],\n420).\n\nOckham\u2019s more parsimonious ontology is important in the attempt to\nunderstand the nature of the opposition to Scotus just outlined.\nOckham is sometimes presented as though his distinctive position on\nthe question of individuation is simply the result of his distinctive\nnominalist position on the question of universals. Thus Armand Maurer,\nin a generally very helpful account of Ockham\u2019s position:\n\nThe problem of individuation, in the usual sense of the term, does not\narise in Ockham\u2019s philosophy. The problem occurs when a philosopher\nmaintains that there are natures or essences in individuals, in some\nway common the individuals and yet diversified in them\u2026. Given\nthe commonness of [e.g] animality, what makes the individual animal to\nbe the individual it is? (Maurer [1994], 373)\n\n\nThis is not quite right. For while Ockham does not need an account of\nindivisibility (since a tenet of Ockham\u2019s nominalism on the question\nof universals is that nothing real is divisible into subjective\nparts), he certainly needs an account of the distinction of one\nsubstance from another, as Black\u2019s reflections on the principle of the\nidentity of indiscernibles forcefully show. In fact, Ockham claims\nthat a substance is singular through itself (\u201cse\nipso\u201d: Ockham, Ordinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, n.\n105\u2013107 (William of Ockham [OT], 2:196, ll. 2\u201312; Spade\n(1994), 171)). And it seems to me that this claim does indeed\nconstitute an attempt at a solution to the problem of distinction. For\nOckham is a nominalist about many more properties than Scotus is, as\nwell as being a nominalist on the question of universals. Thus, Ockham\nbelieves that the set of those predicates that involve no ontological\ncommitment (that is to say, predicates that do not signify anything\nextramental other than merely the substance itself) includes the\nAristotelian genus, specific difference, and proprium\n(necessary but non-defining property) (see e.g. Moody [1935], 97\u2013106,\n145\u201351). Substances themselves are primarily diverse according\nto Ockham \u2013 their distinction from each other is not explained\nby anything other than their own self-identity, and ipso\nfacto not by any qualitative or relational feature of themselves.\nSelf-identity is not, however, a real feature of the substance in any\nsense distinct from itself or its nature. And this is the result not\nof Ockham\u2019s nominalism on the question of universals, but of his\nnominalism on the question of inseparable properties. And much the\nsame seems true of the other opponents of Scotus mentioned above.\n\nOckham\u2019s position thus turns out to be a variety of haecceitism (in a\nmore modern sense of the word). Maintaining that substances are\nprimarily diverse does not amount to having no theory of\nindividuation. Indeed, it presumably entails that their diversity is\nnot explained by, say, qualitative distinction. Thus, Ockham holds\nthat two things, each per se singular, can be\n\u201cprecisely similar\u201d to each other (Ockham,\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, q. 6, n. 108 (William of Ockham [OT],\n2:196, l. 17; Spade (1994), 171)). And this seems to entail some form\nof haecceitism. The difference between this view and that of Scotus is\nthat the haecceity defended by Scotus is \u2013 in some minimal way\n\u2013 hypostatized. Some modern accounts of haecceities\nresemble Ockham\u2019s view more than Scotus\u2019s: the uniquely instantiable,\nnon-qualitative property of (say) being identical with Socrates\n\u2013 Socrates\u2019s haecceity (in the modern terminology) \u2013 does\nnot carry the kind of ontological weight that Scotus wants to place on\nhaecceities as he understands them:\n\nIt may be controversial to speak of a \u2018property\u2019 of being\nidentical with me. I want the word \u2018property\u2019 to carry as\nlight a metaphysical load here as possible. \u2018Thisness\u2019 is\nintended to be a synonym or translation of the traditional term\n\u2018haecceity\u2019 (in Latin, \u2018haecceitas\u2019),\nwhich so far as I know was invented by Duns Scotus. Like many medieval\nphilosophers, Scotus regarded properties as components of the things\nthat have them. He introduced haecceities (thisnesses), accordingly,\nas a special sort of metaphysical component of individuals. I am not\nproposing to revive this aspect of his conception of a haecceity,\nbecause I am not committed to regarding properties as components of\nindividuals. To deny that thisnesses are purely qualitative is not\nnecessarily to postulate \u201cbare particulars,\u201d substrata\nwithout qualities of their own, which would be what was left of the\nindividual when all its qualitative properties were subtracted.\nConversely, to hold that thisnesses are purely qualitative is not to\nimply that individuals are nothing but bundles of qualities, for\nqualities may not be components of individuals at all. We could\nprobably conduct our investigation, in somewhat different terms,\nwithout referring to thisnesses as properties. (Adams [1979],\n6\u20137)\n\n\nNote, of course, that Scotus\u2019s account of the common nature also\nentails something stronger than Adams is proposing: indeed, it entails\nprecisely the sort of minimal hypostatization that Scotus advocates.\nAnd the reason for this, of course, is Scotus\u2019s view that individual\nsubstances cannot themselves be primarily diverse \u2013 a fact that\nis explained by his claim that common natures have some sort of unity\nin their instantiations: the nature in Socrates is (non-numerically)\nthe same as the nature in Plato. Natures, for Scotus, cannot\nbe primarily diverse; substances must include more than natures. But\nindividual natures in Ockham\u2019s view can indeed be primarily diverse,\nand this surely amounts to a form of haecceitism \u2013 nothing other\nthan an individual nature\u2019s own self-identity explains its distinction\nfrom all other such natures. Maintaining that individual natures are\nprimarily diverse amounts not to having no theory of individuation,\nbut to accepting a form of haecceitism that, like Adams\u2019s, does not\ninvolve ontological commitment to the existence of haecceities as\ndistinct real constituents of things. The result, as in Adams, is that\nthe identity of indiscernibles is false even in Scotus\u2019s rather\ntrivial sense.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Texts", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Texts": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aquinas [DEE], <em>De Ente et Essentia</em>, ed.
