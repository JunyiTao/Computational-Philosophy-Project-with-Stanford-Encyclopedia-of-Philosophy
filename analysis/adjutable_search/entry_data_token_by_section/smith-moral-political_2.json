Advantages of Smith\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n\nSmith\u2019s version of moral sentimentalism has a number of\nadvantages over those of his contemporaries. His approach yields moral\njudgments closer to those we already normally make, and makes better\nsense of the complexity and richness of both virtue and the judgment\nof virtue. He is expressly concerned to do justice to this complexity,\ncriticizing Hutcheson for reducing virtue too single-mindedly to\nbenevolence, and Hume for putting too much emphasis on utility.\n\nIn addition, none of Smith\u2019s predecessors had developed such an\nessentially social conception of the self. Hutcheson and Hume both see\nhuman beings as having a natural disposition to care about\nthe good of their society, but for Smith, all our feelings, whether\nself-interested or benevolent, are constituted by a\nprocess of socialization. Smith conceives of humanity as less capable\nof solipsism than Hume does, less capable of the thoroughgoing egoism\nthat Hume, in his famous discussion of the sensible knave, finds it so\ndifficult to refute (Hume 1777, 81\u20132). At the same time, Smith\nreconciles his social conception of the self with a deep respect for\nthe importance of each individual self, and the capacity of each self\nfor independent choice. Ethical self-transformation, for Smith, is\ninspired and guided by social pressures but ultimately carried out by\nthe individual for him or herself. The \u201cimpartial\nspectator\u201d begins as a product and expression of society, but\nbecomes, once internalized, a source of moral evaluation that enables\nthe individual to stand apart from, and criticize, his or her society.\nIndividually free action and the social construction of the self are\ncompatible, for Smith, even dependent on one another.\n\nWe can more fully appreciate what is distinctive in Smith by comparing\nhim with Hume. Smith\u2019s thought circles around Hume\u2019s:\nthere is virtually nothing in either TMS or WN without some sort of\nsource or anticipation in Hume, although there is also almost no\nrespect in which Smith agrees entirely with Hume. Take their accounts\nof sympathy, for example. When Hume describes the workings of\nsympathy, he says that emotions \u201creadily pass from one person to\nanother,\u201d like the motion of a string equally wound up with\nother strings, \u201ccommunicat[ing] itself to the rest\u201d (Hume\n1739\u201340, p. 576; see also pp. 317, 605). He then explains that\nwe obtain our idea of the other person\u2019s feelings by\ninference\u2014from the effects (smiles, frowns) or causes of those\nfeelings. In both cases, the other\u2019s feeling, once inferred,\ncommunicates itself directly to us, and our imaginations only\nintensify our idea of that feeling so as to raise it to the level of\nan impression (Hume 1739\u201340, pp. 576, 319\u201320). For Smith,\nby contrast, we place ourselves in the other\u2019s situation and\nimagine what we would feel if we were there. Imagination is essential\nto the production even of the \u201cidea\u201d of another\u2019s\nfeelings, and sympathetic feelings are no longer ones that the other\nperson need actually have. (Smith points out that this explains how we\nsympathize with some people, like gravely ill infants or the insane,\nwho do not actually experience the suffering we feel on their behalf\n[TMS 12\u201313]). This account allows for us to judge other\npeople\u2019s feelings against the background of our sympathetic\nfeelings for them. Sympathy is thus not just a way of sharing\nfeelings with others; it also opens a gap between their\nfeelings and ours. And that gap gives us a grip on the\nnotion\u2014crucial to Smith\u2019s theory\u2014that certain\nfeelings are appropriate to a situation, while others are not.\n\nThese seemingly slight shifts from Hume\u2014understanding sympathy\nas 1) produced by the imagination and 2) a response to situations\nrather than something passed on, causally, from one person to\nanother\u2014have immense implications for the shape of Smith\u2019s\nthought. The first of them leads him to give a central place to works\nof the imagination in moral development. He frequently brings in\nexamples from poetry and drama to explain or give evidence for his\npoints (e.g., TMS 30, 32\u20133, 34, 177, 227), twice recommends\nwriters like Voltaire as great \u201cinstructors\u201d in certain\nvirtues (TMS 143, 177), and seems to see moral philosophy itself as a\nwork of the imagination, a project that needs to draw on imaginative\nresources and that properly aims at extending and enriching the moral\nimaginations of its readers (compare Griswold 1999, chapter 1). It is\ntherefore for him a project to which clarity, vivacity and elegance\nare as important as good argument, and Smith was in fact very\nconcerned with finding the appropriate rhetoric\u2014the appropriate\nappeal to the imagination\u2014for his works (see Griswold 1999;\nMuller 1993; Brown 1994). Both of his books are beautifully written,\nand filled with vivid, memorable examples.\n\nThe second of the shifts enables Smith to be more of a moral realist\nthan Hume. Smith finds an ingenious way of importing Samuel\nClarke\u2019s concern with \u201cfitnesses\u201d (Clarke 1703) into\nmoral sentimentalism. On his view, we aim to have, and act on, just\nthose feelings that an impartial spectator would have in our\nsituations; the feelings we attribute to such a spectator are then the\nones fitted to that situation. So our feelings have something to aim\nat, by which they can be judged or measured. This allows Smith to\ntalk, as he does throughout TMS, of \u201cfitness\u201d (e.g., 149,\n159, 165, 305, 311), of feelings being \u201csuitable to their\nobjects\u201d (16\u201320, 40, 70, 73, 102), and, by extension, of\npeople being suited to the approval or disapproval bestowed upon them\n(58, 114, 118, 126). He thereby restores a meaning to our ordinary\nview of value judgments as correct or incorrect, and not merely as\nfostering or discouraging actions and qualities that may be useful to\nsociety. Relatedly, he sees our sentiments as more flexible than Hume\ndoes, and more responsive to criticism. As socialized human beings, we\ndo not simply desire certain objects but desire to have just\nthose desires of which an impartial spectator would approve. What are\ntoday called \u201csecond-order desires\u201d accompany and shape\nall our first-order desires (110\u201311; compare Frankfurt 1971). This\ngives our emotions the internal structure they need to be able to\nchange in response to norms.\n\nAccordingly, it makes much more sense for Smith than for Hume that we\nought to assess our sentiments critically. Hume grants that we correct\nour sympathy for partiality by adopting in imagination a \u201csteady\nand general point of view\u201d (Hume 1739\u201340, p. 581), but for\nSmith this concession comes too late. Smith sees sympathy as building\nan aspiration to make one\u2019s sentiments harmonize with the\nsentiments of others into those sentiments themselves. If\nthey did not already have such an aspiration, we would have neither\nmotivation nor reason to take up the \u201csteady and general point\nof view.\u201d It makes little sense to treat our sentiments as\nbaldly given natural reactions, impervious to reason, but then add\nthat they may need \u201ccorrection.\u201d If sentiments are bald\nnatural reactions, they can be neither correct nor incorrect; if they\nare impervious to reason, then we can have reason, at most, to\nappear to have sentiments other than the ones we happen to\nhave, not truly to change those sentiments. For Smith, the\naspiration to be worthy of approval belongs to our sentiments from the\nbeginning, and we have, accordingly, both motivation and reason to\nchange our sentiments if they keep us from this aspiration. \n\nRelatedly, for Smith but not for Hume there is a lot to learn about\nwhat sentiments we should have. In neither the Treatise nor\nthe second Enquiry does Hume spend any significant time on\nhow we might learn to acquire new sentiments or alter the ones we\nhave. By contrast, the first five parts of TMS\u2014almost two-thirds\nof the text\u2014are devoted to a delineation of the various ways in\nwhich we learn to assess our sentiments, and in which learning to\nassess them enables us both to express them with propriety, and to\nchange them.\n\nThere is also for Smith, far more than for Hume, a place for moral\nhistory. Smith\u2019s deep interweaving of individuals with their\nsociety, and of socialization with moral development, alerts him to\nthe many ways in which moral norms and ideals are indexed to\nhistorical circumstances (see Schliesser 2006). This comes out in the\ndetailed accounts he gives, in his lectures on jurisprudence, of how\nnotions of property, contract, marriage, and punishment have arisen\nand changed in various societies. The idea of a history of morals\nopens up here, and Smith\u2014via his student John Millar, who\nattended the lectures on jurisprudence\u2014was an important source\nof later sociological and anthropological accounts of normative\nchange.\n\nFinally, Smith is further from utilitarianism than Hume. Both the\nnotion of sentiments as having or lacking an intrinsic propriety\nindependently of their effects, and the arguments, in Books II and IV,\nagainst reducing our interest in justice and beauty to our interest in\ntheir useful effects, are meant to counteract the utilitarian\ntendencies in Hume. Smith\u2019s particularist conception of moral\njudgment, and his playing down of the effects of actions in favor of\ntheir motivations, keep him far from consequentialism. He believes\nthat our faculties of moral evaluation are always directed toward the\nmotivations and well-being of particular individuals in particular\nsituations, not to goods that might be possessed jointly by groups of\nhuman beings, and he rejects the idea that our assessments or\ndecisions should aim at the greatest happiness for the greatest number\nof people (TMS 237). In addition, he sees happiness as so shaped by\nthe possession of morally appropriate dispositions that it cannot\nserve as a nonmoral goal that might help us define those dispositions.\nIt is essential to the hedonic calculus that happiness be defined\nindependently of morality, so that it can bestow content on moral\nclaims (see McDowell 1998a). That is impossible, for Smith. Smith sees\nmeeting the demands of the impartial spectator as intrinsic to\nhappiness; there is no happiness independent of morality.\n",
