    "main_text": "Whom is the Debate About?\n1. Whom is the Debate About?\n\nThere is, not surprisingly, disagreement about how to define cognitive\nor intellectual disability. (We will use these terms interchangeably,\nignoring, unless specifically relevant, their apparent differences in\nbreadth and emphasis.) There are competing psychometric and functional\ndefinitions, based respectively on standard deviations from the mean\nscore on intelligence tests and on \u201csignificant limitations both\nin intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers\nmany everyday social and practical skills\u201d (American Association\nof Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2011). For this entry,\nwe will consider individuals defined as cognitively disabled in\nfunctional terms, because our interest is in the moral relevance, if\nany, of the absence or substantial limitation of critical cognitive\nfunctions. These limitations are more likely to be captured by\nfunctional than psychometric tests, though as we discuss later, the\nformer as well as the latter may fail to detect significant\nintellectual capacities. We will not assume that, or examine whether,\nindividuals with psychometrically-defined \u201csevere\u201d or\n\u201cprofound\u201d intellectual disabilities are functionally\ndisabled in this way.\n\nAs noted, this entry will focus on human beings with \u201cradical\ncognitive\n disabilities\u201d[2]\n \u2014 disabilities in intellectual function and capacity that limit\nor preclude the development of one or more attributes believed to\nconfer full moral status. Among those attributes are the consciousness\nof oneself as a temporally-extended being; practical\nrationality\u2014the capacity to govern one\u2019s actions by\nreasoning about how to act; and the capacity to make and respond to\nmoral demands. (We will often abbreviate the list to\n\u201cself-consciousness or practical rationality\u201d without\nmaking any assumptions about the centrality or relationship of the two\nattributes.) These attributes, as well as others held to be required\nfor full moral status, may be possessed by different subsets of human\nbeings, and the relationship among such attributes is a matter of\nconsiderable dispute. This dispute, however, is best deferred to a\nfuller treatment of the grounds of moral status; we will discuss them\nonly to the extent that they bear on the moral status of human beings\nwith significant cognitive disabilities.\n\nThe category of \u201cradical cognitive disability\u201d is\nstipulative. We do not start with the assumption that any specific\nhuman being falls into that category, or even that some human beings\ndo. Eva Kittay (2005) has argued that there is no reason to assume\nthat any human beings are radically cognitively disabled, in the sense\nwe are using the term. Jeff McMahan (2009) has countered that the\nexistence of such human beings is very likely: given the continuous\nnature of fetal and infant neurological development, it is very likely\nthat some human beings are radically disabled because their\ndevelopment has ceased or been interrupted at points where they have\nnot yet acquired morally relevant capacities. Even if McMahan\u2019s\n\u201cexistence argument\u201d for radical impairment is correct,\nhowever, it does not remove the daunting uncertainty of attributing\nradical cognitive impairment to any actual human being.\n\nThis uncertainty arises in part from a lack of clarity and consensus\nabout what would count as adequate evidence of self- and\nother-awareness and practical rationality. To resolve that question,\nit is necessary to confront not only interpretive ambiguities in\nmaking inferences about the content of other minds, but conceptual\nissues about what it means to possess critical cognitive functions.\nSimilar issues are raised in the debate about animal consciousness\n(see the Entry on\n animal consciousness),\n but there is also disagreement about whether the kinds of evidence\nadduced for and against the cognitive capacities of animals are\nequally relevant in assessing the cognitive capacities of human beings\n(Kittay 2005; McMahan 2002, 2005, 2008).\n\nThe primary reason for restricting the entry to radical cognitive\ndisability, like the reason for restricting it to cognitive\ndisability, is dialectical. Few contemporary philosophers would deny\nthat human beings with mild or moderate cognitive disabilities have\nthe attributes required for what we call \u201cfull moral\nstatus.\u201d Philosophers who see self-consciousness and practical\nrationality as necessary for that status generally recognize that\nmildly and moderately disabled humans possess those attributes, and\npossess them to the extent necessary to reach the threshold set by\ntheir accounts of full moral status (see\n Sec. 2.1).\n\nBy stipulating a category of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities, we seek to avoid difficult empirical issues about the\nextent to which individuals classified as having serious cognitive\ndisabilities actually lack the psychological functions held to confer\nmoral status. Even the most direct assessments of these functions may\nfail to recognize atypical, especially nonverbal, forms of cognitive\nfunctioning. And with the possible exception of extreme cases like\nanencephaly, there are formidable difficulties in inferring a lack of\ncognitive capacity from a lack of specific behavior or brain activity.\nAs recent work on intellectually conscious states has revealed (Wannez\net al. 2017, Real et al. 2015), some psychological capacities are\ndifficult to detect neurologically or behaviorally.\n\nWe recognize that there are objections to the use of stipulation to\nsidestep these difficult empirical issues. Disability scholars insist\nthat philosophers must recognize that the terms they use will\ninevitably be taken to refer to actual human beings, so that they\ncannot stipulate away concerns about hurt and misinterpretation\n(Kittay 2005; Wong 2007). Moreover, the prevalence of individuals who\nactually satisfy their stipulations has relevance to morally\nsignificant policy issues, such as the costs and benefits of more\ninclusive educational practices. Nevertheless, we will rely on the\nstipulation that we have made about radical cognitive disability, in\npart because the assumption that some human beings are radically\ndisabled is shared by many of those who argue for the full\nmoral status of all human beings. \n\nWe will discuss only radical cognitive disabilities that are\ncongenital or early-onset. The question of how moral status is\naffected by the loss of important cognitive functions is a\ndistinct one, both for those who believe such functions confer moral\nstatus and those who do not. Concerning the former, the question is\nwhether moral status can survive the loss of the functions on the\nbasis of which it was conferred. For those who deny that moral status\nrequires the possession of those functions, their loss may still raise\nimportant questions about personal identity, and about the\nfirst-person authority of the earlier, nondisabled self over the\nlater, disabled self. The treatment of \u201conce-competent\u201d\nindividuals in minimally conscious states, or with severe dementia,\nthus raises distinct issues about the impact of psychological\ndiscontinuity or loss of mental function on the relationship of human\nindividuals to their past or future selves. There has been a\nprotracted controversy, and a large literature, on these issues\n(Dresser 1995; Dworkin 1994; Stone 2007); they deserve separate\ndiscussion.\n",
