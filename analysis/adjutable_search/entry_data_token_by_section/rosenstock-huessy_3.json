The Partitioning of Spaces and Times in In the Cross of Reality\n\nThe matter of incarnation is central to Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s\nmagnum opus In the Cross of Reality. For it is this work that\nmost thoroughly examines love and suffering as the great drivers of\nhuman endeavour through their spatial and temporal incarnations. The\nfounding and perpetuation of new institutions which store our loves,\ncarry us across the times, and hence (when working well) replenish us,\nis, for Rosenstock-Huessy the real capacity for freedom that we bear.\nFor this drawing upon the times and being able to found new bodies of\ntime is our way of immortalising ourselves. Our world is what we make\nof it; our different historicities are our creations, our\n\u2018compositions\u2019 that reach across the times. \n\n\nThe scores of this composition, the histories, must be paraphrased in\nso many editions as there are generations of humankind. For the\ncomposition is recomposed in each generation by those whose love\novercomes a murder or a death.\n\nSo history becomes a great song, Augustine\u2019s Carmen Humanum; in\nits every line, perhaps every tone, becomes a lived human life. As\nsoon and as often as the lines rhyme, love has once again become\nstronger than death. Then from out of absurd contingencies, from\nadverse circumstances, from silent events of epoch-making necessities,\nin which a lengthy ingested illness is finally confronted,\ncrossfertilized and consequently overcome (2008/9, 3: 513).\n\n\nThat this task is all too frequently eclipsed by more philosophical\nvisions of reality is for Rosenstock-Huessy in large part due to\nphilosophy failing to understand the \u2018forces of community\u2019\nwhich are constitutive of our reflexivity and activity.\n\nThe first volume of In the Cross of Reality, The Hegemony of\nSpaces, is primarily a work of method. It simultaneously provides\na critique of the philosophical inheritance that Rosenstock-Huessy\nargues distorts our social understanding or reflexivity and\nparticipation or actualization, whilst excavating more primordial\nelements, moods, and insights that emerge in social experience.\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s argument is predicated upon the distinction\nbetween spaces of play and living spaces. He claims that play prepares\nus for life. Thus, like Horace Bushnell (whose work inspired him to\nrethink his earlier drafting of the first volume of In the Cross\nof Reality) and Johan Huizinga, he sees play as generating\ncrucial conditions of reflexivity.\n\nSocratic philosophy, with its turn to abstract distance and\ndefinition, confirms this for him. Socrates, says Rosenstock-Huessy,\nis the spectator who gives advice to the \u2018athletes\u2019 in the\nintermission (Rosenstock-Huessy, 2009, 1: 107). Rosenstock-Huessy\nargues that philosophy commences a spatially preoccupied way of\nthinking, which requires that living processes be stabilized. The\ncollective affirmations and directions of social appeals and socially\nagreed upon names become essences or substantiations processed by the\nphilosophical mind, which finds itself magically outside of the\nreality it processes. Philosophical reality becomes populated with\nmetaphysical entities such as the individual, subject, and object,\nappearance and reality etc. In this mentally sequestered space the\nmind is only beholden to its own elements and powers. Thus logic can\nbecome king in a philosophical world; while we on the earth remain\ncaught up in the forces that accompany the seismic events which shake\nus into new realities. The Hegemony of Spaces claims that\nthis philosophical preoccupation culminates in the mechanistic\ndissolution of the world into space (exemplified by Descartes\u2019\nThe World): thus too the lived times which we register in the\ncalendar, in holidays, in days of remembrance and prayer etc. are\nsimply dissolved into the mechanics of a spatially derived time or\nsequential chronology. The response to this process of mechanization\nis exemplified by Nietzsche\u2019s equally one-sided response to\nreality\u2014the aestheticization of life and exaggerated emphasis upon\nthe will.\n\nFor Rosenstock-Huessy, the philosophies of Descartes and Nietzsche\nintensify the spatial \u2018crampedness\u2019 that is the outcome of\nthe spatial hegemony accompanying the triumph of abstract reflexivity\nover our play and life-spaces. Their different responses contribute to\na more spatially defined (more mechanized albeit more aestheticized)\nworld: modernity becomes a \u2018tyranny of spaces\u2019.\n\nIn so far as much of what has just been said has certain thematic\noverlaps and overlays with Nietzsche\u2019s, and even\nHeidegger\u2019s, critique of metaphysics, the last point should\nclarify how he differs from them. For Rosenstock-Huessy, while our\nspace-partitioning is secondary to our time-partitioning, and thus\nfounding of new ways to be in the world, he sees that the intersection\nof what he calls our trajective and prejective powers requires that we\nengage far more deeply with our historicity than either are prepared\nto do.\n\nCentral to this volume, and what is a fundamental departure from\nNietzsche, is Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s identification of the social\nprocesses and elements of tensional reciprocity that are intrinsic to\nour capacity for space partitioning. Thus, for example, whether it be\nthe family, the workplace, or the army, these institutions function\nprecisely because the members of each institution work on different\nfronts of reality. Ultimately the work is a critique of the kind of\nabstract understanding of sociality that sacrifices the reality of\ntensional reciprocity for a more uniform \u2018picture\u2019 of\nsocial reality, as he believes has become increasingly typical of\nmodern thought, irrespective of whether it is liberal, fascist, or\nMarxist.\n\nThe Full Count of the Times is essentially a work of\nuniversal history. It is devoted to exploring the distinctive social\norientations and formations and their enduring components and\ndevelopment. It claims to identify the past elements of recurrent\nexperience, the paths of \u2018future-directed\u2019 events and\ntheir mutual interplay or strengthening in the formation of\nworld-transforming institutions. In particular, Rosenstock-Huessy\ndwells upon how the discrete forms of antiquity and the peoples of\ntribes, empires, the Greek city states, and the future orientated\npeople of the prophets (the Jews) formed a hitherto unknown kind of\nsocial tensional \u2018unity\u2019 through their absorption and\nreconfiguration within Western Christian lands . He then seeks to\nidentify how that tensionality that had been formed through the\npresence and activity of the Church subsequently broke out and\ndeveloped, initially in Europe, into nations and then, through the\nworld wars, the planet as whole.\n",
