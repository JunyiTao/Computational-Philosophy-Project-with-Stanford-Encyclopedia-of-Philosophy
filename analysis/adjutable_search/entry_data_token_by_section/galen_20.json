    "main_text": "Ethics || Overall Model and Approach\n8.1 Overall Model and Approach\nGalen\u2019s theoretical ethics is closely related to his Platonist conception of the soul. Central is the view that rational and non-rational psychic capacities must be treated separately, both in terms of early discipline and education and in terms of our conceptualization and treatment of their pathologies. Virtues\u2014although a full or systematic account of these is elusive\u2014may be understood, Platonically, as consisting in the proper functioning of each soul part, and in the proper internal relationship of the parts within the whole. The non-rational (alogon), if not subject to the discipline of the rational, will lead the soul into pathos (\u201caffection\u201d or \u201cpassion\u201d), causing actions of uncontrolled greed, lustfulness or anger. This part is not accessible to rational discourse, but must rather be subjected to a process of training and habituation which will make its appetites appropriate. Within the non-rational, however, there is the further division into desiderative (epithum\u0113tikon) and spirited (thumoeides); although non-rational (and in undisciplined cases the cause of uncontrolled rage), the latter also has an instinctive reaction of indignation against wrongdoing and shameful behaviour, and can so be made the ally of the rational in carrying out the discipline of the desiderative part. (This complex relationship within the tripartite soul enables\u2014for Galen as for Plato\u2014an account of how certain non-rational drives, in particular reactions of shame and indignation, may be in conflict with other non-rational drives, e.g., lust or greed.)\nIn Aff. Pecc. Dig., Ind. and Mor., Galen strongly suggests\u2014in a way consistent with Platonic and Aristotelian perceptions\u2014that early habituation and discipline, as well as the right natural endowments, are crucial to the production of this appropriate level of desires and right relationship between rational and non-rational drives within the soul. There are also quite close Platonic echoes in his commitment to various forms of early mathematical and musical training. At the same time, he describes in some detail, especially in Aff. Pecc. Dig. I, a process of moral self-discipline, involving elements of \u201ccognitive therapy\u201d, which may assist even the mature person prone to pathos and to distress to remedy his or her faults. The texts stand within a tradition of works on ethical therapy and self-improvement, exemplified by such authors as the Platonist Plutarch and the Stoics Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca; they offer a range of practical approaches (Singer 2018): daily self-monitoring; adjustment of one\u2019s expectations; the co-option of a neutral observer to give an objective assessment of the level of one\u2019s faults and of one\u2019s progress. (The relationship with this tradition is explored in detail by Gill 2010; see also Singer 2013, Ch. 3; and Kaufman 2014, arguing also for a strong Epicurean input, especially to the discussion of Ind.)\nThe focus is on the reduction or elimination of one\u2019s path\u0113; here, in spite of the Platonist psychological framework, Galen is engaging in a discourse developed especially by Stoic authors, and to some extent adopting their technical language. This observation leads us on to some further consideration of Galen\u2019s views and their relationship with the contemporary ethical discourse.\n",
