Broca's area and Wernicke's area\n\n\n\nBeginning with the work of Broca and Wernicke in the 19th century, a \npopular view has been that language is localized to certain areas of \nthe brain (see Fig. 3), almost always the left \n hemisphere,[19]\n and that it is subject to characteristic patterns of breakdown, \ncalled \u2018aphasias.\u2019 (See Saffran 2000 for a survey of the\nvarious aphasias.) For example, Broca's area is strongly implicated \nin speech production, and damage to this area can result in a \ncharacteristic inability (\u2018Broca's aphasia\u2019 or \n\u2018agrammatism\u2019) to produce fluent speech, especially \ncomplex grammatical structures and grammatical morphemes. The fact \nthat syntax can apparently be selectively interfered with by lesions \nto Broca's area has been taken by some to indicate that grammatical \nknowledge is localized to that area, and this in turn has been taken \nto show support the view that there is a special biological inborn \nbasis for that knowledge. (Lenneberg 1964, 1967 is the original \nproponent of this argument, which is echoed in more recent \ndiscussions, such as Pinker 1994:297-314.)\n\n\nIt is unclear, however, why this inference should seem compelling.\nFirst, as Elman et al. 1996 argue, neural localization of\nfunction can occur as a result of virtually any developmental\ntrajectory: the localization of some function bears not at all on its\ninnateness.\n\n\nSecondly, it is now known that neural localization for language is \nvery much a relative, rather than an all-or-nothing matter (Dronkers \net al. 2000, Dick et al. 2001, Martin 2003). Not\nonly is language processing widely distributed over the brain (see\nFig. 4), but traditionally language-specific areas of cortex are\nimplicated in a variety of non-linguistic tasks as well. Broca's area,\nfor instance, \u2018lights up\u2019 on MEG scans\n(magnetoencephalography, a method for measuring changes in the\nmagnetic properties of the brain due to electrical activity) when\nsubjects hear a discordant musical sequence in much the same way as it\ndoes when they hear an ungrammatical utterance. (Maess et\nal. 2001; a special issue of Nature Neuroscience, 6(7),\nJuly 2003, explores the implications of this finding.)\n\n\nFinally, recent studies of cortical plasticity have shown that even\nthe most plausible candidates for innate specification \u2014 such as\nthe use of visual cortex for vision or the use of auditory cortex for\nhearing \u2014 exhibit high degrees of experience-dependent\nplasticity. For example, in congenitally blind subjects, the areas of\nthe brain normally used for seeing are taken over for the processing\nof Braille (Sadato et al. 1996; Hamilton and Pascual-Leone,\n1998) and even in those with late-onset blindness, significant\n\u2018rewiring\u2019 of visual cortex for other perceptual tasks is\napparent (Kujala et al. 1997). Likewise, in the congenitally deaf,\nauditory cortex is used for the processing of sign language (Nishimura\net al. 1999, von Melchner, Pallas and Sur 2000). (See Shimojo and\nShams 2001, for a review.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Pet scan showing brain regions involved in various language\ntasks. From Posner and Raichle (1997, 15). Used by permission of M. \nRaichle.\n\n\n\nAs Marcus (2004:40-45) points out in response to Elman et\nal. 1996, the ability of the brain to \u2018rewire\u2019 itself\nunder exceptional circumstances is consistent with its having been\n\u2018prewired,\u2019 or set up, differently by the genes. However,\nthese sorts of data indicate that complex functions, such as are\ninvolved in processing sign language, can be carried out in areas of\nbrain that are \u2018prewired\u2019 (if they are) to do something\nquite different.  This suggests that these abilities require little in\nthe way of task-specific pre-wiring, and are learned largely on the\nbasis of experience (together with whatever sort of 'prewiring' is\nsupplied for the cortex as a whole). That is, if sign language\nprocessing tasks can be carried out by areas of cortex that are\npresumably innately predisposed (if they are) to do auditory\nprocessing, then the former competence must be being learned in the\nabsence of inborn constraints or knowledge that are specific to that\ntask. Of course, these are pathological cases, and it is unclear\nwhether the subjects in these experiments had any special training in\norder that their brains were \u2018rewired\u2019 in these\nways. Nonetheless, examples like these provide an existence proof of\nthe brain's ability to acquire complex processing capacities \u2014\nindeed, processing capacities relevant to language \u2014 in the\ncomplete absence of inborn, domain-specific information. As such, they\nraise the possibility that other aspects of language processing are\nsimilarly acquired in the absence of task-specific constraints.\n\n\nIn sum, the neuroscientific evidence currently available provides no \nsupport for linguistic nativism. The suggestion that localization of \nfunction is indicative of a substantial degree of innate \nprespecification is no longer tenable: localization can arise in many\ndifferent ways. In addition, linguistic functions do not seem to be \nparticularly localized: language use and understanding are complex \ntasks, involving many different brain areas \u2014 areas that are in\nat least some cases implicated also in other tasks. It is hard to see\nhow to reconcile these facts with the Chomskyan postulation of a \nmonolithic \u2018language organ,\u2019 the development or \n\u2018growth\u2019 of which is controlled largely by the genes. \nFinally, the fact that complex functions can be learned and carried \nout by areas of brain that are innately \u2018prewired\u2019 (if at\nall) to do quite different sorts of processing indicates that such \ncompetences can be and are acquired without any inborn, task-specific\nguidance. This is not, of course, to say that language is one of the \ncompetences that are acquired in this way. For all the current \nevidence shows, many areas of cortex in which language develops may \nindeed be \u2018prewired\u2019 for that task: linguistic nativism \nis still consistent with what is now known. It is, however, to \nsuggest that although there may be other reasons to be a linguistic \nnativist, general considerations to do with brain organization or \ndevelopment as currently understood give no especial support to that \nposition.\n",
