    "main_text": "Sources and context\n1. Sources and context\n\nWhile the other two great rationalists, Descartes and Leibniz, were\nphysical theorists and mathematicians of the first rank, who made\nsubstantial contributions to the development of physical science, the\nsame cannot be said of Spinoza. Nor was Spinoza a systematic\nexperimentalist. Indeed, his contributions to the historical\ndevelopment of physical theory are minimal. This is not because the\nphysical theory he presented was rejected or overlooked, but rather\nbecause Spinoza simply never presented a physical theory as such. Most\nof his writing concerning physical theory is instead in the service of\nother ends: exegetical, as an expositor of Descartes' philosophy;\nmetaphysical, in elaborating, for example, the relationships between\nGod or Nature as the single substance and the finite things he treats\nas \u201cmodes\u201d thereof; or psychological, in explaining the\ndistinctive characteristics and possible blessedness of the human mind\nas the idea of an especially complex individual body.\n\nThe main sources of evidence for Spinoza's thought concerning physical\nnature are his Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, the first\nhalf of his magnum opus the Ethics, and a number of important\nletters from his correspondence. The PCP contains by far the\nmost focused and detailed of Spinoza's writing on physics proper, but\nis officially billed as an exposition of Descartes. The first half of\nthe Ethics presents a physical theory only insofar as Spinoza\nfinds this necessary to serve his goals in that work to explicate the\nnature of God and the natures and origins of the human mind and its\naffects. Discussion of the physical in the correspondence, though\noften illuminating, is typically directed at providing either\nclarification or defense of his views in response to queries and\nobjections, or at discussing contemporary views and developments in\nexperimental and theoretical science in order to show that they are\neither mistaken or consistent with his own views.\n",
