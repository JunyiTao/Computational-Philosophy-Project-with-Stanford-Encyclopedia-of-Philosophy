    "main_text": "Cosmology\n6. Cosmology\n\nIn discussing the fundamental traits of the Necessary Existent,\nal-Ghazali considers the implications of the divine attribute of\nabsolute simplicity to the scope of divine causation and conception of\nthe universe. Al-Ghazali explains, following Avicenna, that from what\nis one and simple (i.e., the Necessary Existent) only one thing may\nproceed (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 157;\ncf. al-Shif\u0101\u02be [Metaphysics]:\n326\u2013334; al-Naj\u0101t: 649\u2013657). Underlying this\nunderstanding of the scope of divine causation is a conception of the\nrelationship between cause and effect as one of correspondence;\n\u201cthe action must be consistent with the essential nature of its\ncause\u201d (Kogan 1984: 249). Thus, a single cause has one act and\nproduces only a single effect. In keeping with this conception, and\nconsidering the absolute simplicity of the First Principle,\nal-Ghazali, describes an emanationist cosmology in which the First\nPrinciple causes multiplicity not directly, but through a\nchain of emanative intermediaries that successively proceed from one\nanother. The First Principle produces only one entity, the first\nintellect, by thinking Itself. In turn, the first intellect produces,\nby thinking its Cause and itself, the second intellect and the first\ncelestial sphere (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 157). The reason for\nthis multiplicity is that the first intellect is not absolutely simple\nlike the First Principle, but complex: in addition to thinking its\nPrinciple, it thinks itself insofar as it is possible and insofar as\nit is necessary by virtue of the First Principle. The process of\nemanation continues in a descending manner, terminating with the\nActive Intellect, the intellect of the sphere of the moon which is the\nimmediate source of the forms of sublunary entities.\n\nConvinced that the scheme of emanation constitutes an unsatisfactory\ndeviation from Aristotle, Albalag devotes extensive discussions to\nelucidating its inconsistency and fallacies, and alternatively\nestablishing what he regards as the correct Aristotelian scheme.\nUnlike the scheme of emanation, this scheme ascribes the\nuniverse\u2019s manifold existents to God\u2019s direct causation:\n\u201cfrom what is one and simple many things can come to be\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.96:\n 69).[2]\n Albalag describes a hierarchical cosmological scheme of separate\nintellects and celestial spheres in which each separate intellect\nrelates to the corresponding sphere as a cause of motion while the\nFirst Principle/Intellect relates to all separate intellects as a\ndirect formal\n cause.[3]\n Two theories account for this cosmological scheme: \n\nthe theory of divine knowledge, which, as illustrated formerly,\nmaintains that the First Intellect apprehends the forms of all\nexistents by thinking Its essence, and \n the Aristotelian theory of \u201ccognitive identification\u201d\naccording to which the knowing subject, the known object and thinking\nare identical in actual thinking (for further details about this\ntheory see Black 1999). \n\n\nBy definition, separate intellects are intellects in actu\nwhose substantiation is the very act of thinking. Without\nknowledge, the essence of the separate intellect would be nullified.\nThus, separate intellects, just like the First Intellect, have actual\nknowledge of the forms of all existents. In actual thinking, the\nknower, the known object, and the act of thinking are identical\n(Tiqqun n.42: 65), the relationship of identity being\nparticularly formal as Aristotle\u2019s dictum of cognitive\nidentification establishes (De Anima 3.8 431b21). This means\nthat in separate intellects \u201cessence/form\u201d, the known\nobject and the act of thinking are the same. In this way, the First\nIntellect is said to be \u201cthe formal cause\u201d of the separate\nintellects on the grounds that It provides them with \u201ctheir\nforms\u201d, i.e., the intelligible forms which they apprehend and by\nmeans of which they are what they are, intellects in actu\n(Tiqqun n.69:\n 98).[4]\n\nThis cosmological account, however, calls for explaining how separate\nintellects are differentiated. After all, separate intellects share\nthe feature of immateriality, hence they cannot be numbered.\nFurthermore, considering the fact that separate intellects share the\nsame epistemological content (i.e., the forms of all existents derived\nfrom the First Intellect) and that the knower is identical with the\nobject known, according to the Aristotelian dictum of \u201ccognitive\nidentity\u201d, separate intellects should all be identical. In the\nAvicennian-emanative scheme, intellects are numbered on account of the\ncausal relation between them, each intellect being the cause of an\nintellect emanating from it and \u201conly God, who is at the top of\nthe series is an uncaused caused\u201d (Wolfson 1958 : 244). By\nrejecting the conception of an emanative causal relationship between\nintellects, Albalag, however, could not speak of a distinction in\nterms of causal relation. Alternatively, he follows Averroes in\npositing ontological hierarchy as the differentiating factor between\nintellects (Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut: fifth discussion:\n173). While each separate intellect derives its knowledge directly\nfrom the First Intellect, each stands in a specific hierarchical\nrelation to the First Intellect, the ranking of each intellect being\nin accordance with the extent of purity of its mode of apprehension;\nthe purer and simpler the mode of apprehension the closer the\nintellect in rank to the First Intellect. Overlap between these modes\nis not possible, which ensures that separate intellects remain\ndifferentiated.\n\nBeyond this cosmological account, Albalag indicates that multiplicity\nin the sublunary realm also comes forth from the deity; the First is\nsaid to be the cause of multiplicity inasmuch as It is the ultimate\ncause of the cosmic unity. Were it not for the unifying force that\nholds the parts together, the universe as a totality and its\nparts\u2014each of which comes to be by virtue of a unifying force\nthat conjoins its constituent parts like matter and form and the\nelements\u2014would not exist (Tiqqun n.69: 97; cf.\nAverroes Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut, third discussion:\n108).\n",
