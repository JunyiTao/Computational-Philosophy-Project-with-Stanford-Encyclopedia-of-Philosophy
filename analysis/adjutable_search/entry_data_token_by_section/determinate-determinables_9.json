    "main_text": "Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates || Preliminary motivations against the existence or irreducibility of determinables\n3.2 Preliminary motivations against the existence or irreducibility of determinables\n\nThe main preliminary motivations against determinables existing or\nbeing metaphysically irreducible to determinates reflect concerns that\nsuch determinables would be unparsimonious, give rise to causal\noverdetermination, and/or violate the supposition that reality is\nultimately or fundamentally maximally determinate. These concerns and\nassociated support for anti-realist (\u2018eliminativist\u2019) or\nrealist reductionist accounts are similar to those sometimes brought\nto bear against irreducible higher-level (e.g., special scientific)\ngoings-on. Here again, the motivations are preliminary; as we\u2019ll\nsee down the line, realists offer various responses to these\nconcerns.\n\n3.2.1 Reality as maximally determinate\n\nOne objection to irreducible determinables appeals to the supposition\nthat reality itself is maximally determinate, such that there are no\nirreducible determinable properties; as Armstrong maintains,\n\u201c[a]ll universals must be determinate\u201d (1978b: 117).\nRelatedly, many suppose that there is no \u201cvagueness\u201d in\nthe world; as Lewis maintains, \u201c[t]he only intelligible account\nof vagueness locates it in our thought and language\u201d (1986:\n 212).[16]\n\n3.2.2 Determinables as failing to track exact\nsimilarity\n\nAnother objection to irreducible determinables is that they could not\ndo the work of explaining exact similarity (in a given respect)\nbetween objects. Hence Armstrong takes \u201cthe powerful truism that\nuniversals are strictly identical in their distinct\ninstantiations\u201d to support the claim that \u201cproperties that\nare lowest determinates [\u2026] are good candidates for being\nuniversals\u201d (1997: 49). More weakly, one might maintain that the\nbest reason for positing properties, however understood, is as\nexplaining exact similarity (in a given respect) between objects.\nSupposing so, one might moreover maintain that only determinates\nexist, on grounds that particulars having determinable properties\nmight fail to exactly resemble in determinate respects (e.g., red\nobjects might be different shades of\n red).[17]\n\n3.2.3 Determinables as ontologically or causally\nredundant\n\nIrreducible determinables have been taken to be ontologically and\ncausally redundant, since determinates which we have independent\nreason to posit can explain or do anything that determinables\npurportedly explain or do. Hence Massin (2013) maintains against\nJohansson (2000) that perceived inexact resemblances between\ndeterminates can explain the \u201cseen unity of the determinate\ncolors\u201d, and Gillett and Rives maintain that determinables are\ncausally unnecessary:\n\n\n[P]ositing instances of determinate properties offers the best\nexplanation for the causal relations we observe in the world\n[\u2026] Should we also accept that there are instances of\ndeterminable properties corresponding to predicates such as \u2018is\ncolored\u2019 or \u2018is charged\u2019? [\u2026] There is a\nclear concern that it is ontologically profligate to take two\nproperties to be contributing causal powers, a determinable and its\ndeterminate, where one, the determinate, would apparently suffice.\n(2005: 487)\n\n\nHeil (2003) levels similar complaints.\n\n3.2.4 Determinables as inducing causal\noverdetermination\n\nRelated to the concern about causal redundancy is the concern that\nirreducible broadly scientific determinables induce problematic causal\noverdetermination (see again Heil 2003 and Gillett and Rives 2005). To\nstart, if such determinables exist, they need to earn their causal\n keep.[18]\n But following the concern about causal redundancy, determinables\nsimply reproduce the powers of their determinates, allowing instances\nof distinct properties to give rise to the same effect on a given\noccasion. And while such overdetermination sometimes occurs, as in\nfiring squad or double-rock-throw cases, this is not the right model\nfor determinables and\n determinates.[19]\n\n3.2.5 Determinables as incoherent\n\nAnother objection to determinables is that they are in some sense\nincoherent. Armstrong (1978a: 106\u20137, 117\u201318) maintains\nthis on grounds that determinables are supposed to constitute the\nrespect in which associated determinates are both similar and\ndissimilar, so that, e.g., red and yellow are\nsupposed to be both similar and different in respect of\ncolour (see Elder 1996: 151 for\n discussion).[20]\n Fales (1990: 174) sees the objection as incorrectly presupposing that\ndeterminables are second-order properties of or relations between\ndeterminates. Massin (2013) takes the objection to depend on whether\nthe similarity at issue is exact or inexact; if inexact, there is no\nproblem (\u201c[t]wo things that are imperfectly similar in their\ncolour can be imperfectly dissimilar in their colour\u201d) but if\nexact\u2014reflecting, e.g., determinables\u2019 being exactly\nsimilar constituents of determinates\u2014then incoherence follows,\nsince differences between determinates must be explained by what\n\u201cremains\u201d once the shared determinable is removed, but we\ncannot make sense of such removal.\n",
