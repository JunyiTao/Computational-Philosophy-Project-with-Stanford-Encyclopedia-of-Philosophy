    "main_text": "Perception || Rivalling Accounts of Perceptual Sensations\n2.4 Rivalling Accounts of Perceptual Sensations\n\nNow Broad is perfectly clear that the sensum analysis of perception\ncannot be established simply by pointing to such phenomena as the\npenny seen obliquely. He does not for a moment suppose that it is\npossible to logically infer that there is an elliptical sensum from\nthe proposition that something sensibly appears elliptical\n(pace Barnes 1945, p. 113). What he claims is that there are\nconsiderations that can be adduced in support of the sensum analysis.\nWhen we look at the penny from the side we certainly seem to\nbe aware of something elliptical. So we certainly seem to have before\nour minds something that is elliptical. Obviously \u201cwe can quite\nwell mistakenly believe a property to be present which is\nreally absent, when we are dealing with something that is only known\nto us indirectly, like Julius C\u00e6sar or the North Pole\u201d\n(1923, p. 241; Broad\u2019s emphasis). But there are phenomenological\ndifferences between perception and belief (or thought) that seem to\ncall for different accounts of their nature. In perception we seem to\nbe dealing with properties that are presented to us. Consider the case\nof perceiving a stick half immersed in water. Here\n\nwe are dealing with a concrete visible object, which is bodily present\nto our senses; and it is very hard to understand how we could seem to\nourselves to see the property of bentness exhibited in a\nconcrete instance, if in fact nothing was present to our\nminds that possessed that property. (1923, p. 241; Broad\u2019s\nemphasis; see also pp. 244\u20135)\n\n\nI believe that what Broad is driving at here is that perceptual\nconsciousness has a presentational nature, and it is this\nthat makes it plausible to regard it as involving the literal presence\nof objects with various qualities, such as colours in the case of\nvisual perception, sounds in auditory, etc.\n\nBroad\u2019s theory of perception employs an act-object analysis of\nsensations. Lest it should be thought that he should be incapable to\nthink of any alternative account it should be noted that he examines\nsuch an analysis as early as in 1921. G. F. Stout and H. A. Prichard\ndefended such an alternative (both of whom Broad held in the highest\nregard). Their account could be considered an early version of the\nadverbial analysis of sensations. Broad asks us to consider a\nheadache. \u201cIt is by no means clear that a headache means a state\nof mind with a headachy object [i.e. an act with a certain object]; it\nseems on the whole more plausible to say that that it is just a\nheadachy state of mind\u201d (1921b, p. 392). To have a headache is\nnot to be aware of a headachy object but to feel in a certain\n way.[6]\n The alternative account claims that this holds mutatis\nmutandis for any type of sensation. Thus what is\ndescribed as \u2018a sensation of red\u2019 is a unitary state of\nmind, and strictly speaking not a state which decomposes into an act\nof sensing and a sensed red patch.\n\nBroad provides a fairly thorough discussion of the relative merits of\nthe adverbial and the act-object analysis. In a nutshell, his\nconclusion is that although the adverbial analysis is highly plausible\nregarding such mental phenomena as bodily feelings; but it is\nimplausible when it comes to those of visual and auditory experiences:\nthe act-object analysis is the more plausible account of such\nexperiences, in Broad\u2019s opinion. (See Broad 1923, pp.\n 252\u20137.)[7]\n\nSo much for sensations. What about sensa? What are they on\nBroad\u2019s account? A brief answer must suffice here. Sensa are a\ncertain kind of transitory particulars, which in the case of visual\nperception have such properties as shape, size, colour, etc (1925, p.\n 181f.).[8]\n",
