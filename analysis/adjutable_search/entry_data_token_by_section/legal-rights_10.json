Criticism: Rights\u2019 Disvalue to Right-Holders\n\nThe assumption that rights are inherently for right-holders has been\nchallenged. This entry only scratches the surface of this rich\ncritical terrain, which has much of its foundation in Karl\nMarx\u2019s 1844 essay \u201cOn the Jewish Question\u201d.\n\nMarx thought that legal rights at most provide right-holders with\nformal justice and civic emancipation, not with freedom from material\nneed or social and economic control. For Marx, moreover,\nsociety\u2019s primary legal and political institutions serve\neconomic production, with legal rights functioning as a primary\nmechanism for the facilitation and enforcement of a social structure\nthat prizes not the interests, agency, welfare, or dignity of\nright-holders but rather economic growth and the interests of the\neconomically powerful (see Waldron 1987b: 126\u2013127). Thus,\nrights\u2019 liberal fa\u00e7ade is deceptive, concealing\nrights\u2019 role in economic exploitation and social control (see,\ne.g., J. Cohen 1983). \n\nThis line of criticism can, however, go too far. Firstly, civil\nliberties do benefit right-holders, to some degree. Moreover, even if\nimperfect, rights (certainly in their more modern manifestations) can\nand do provide a measure of social and economic freedoms,\nentitlements, and justice (Waldron 1987c: 156\u2013159), and have\noccasionally facilitated social change and progressive politics. \n\nA second influential Marxist critique is that legal rights promote\negoism and social atomism. A criticism that also echoes in\n communitarian\n and\n conservative\n traditions in political theory. In a nutshell, by ordering\npeople\u2019s relations based on directed claims, duties, and powers,\nrights distance and separate people, promote conflict and competition,\ninvite antisocial behavior, structure relationships based on economic\nroles, and foster selfish and self-absorbed practices and unvirtuous\ncharacter. All at the cost of interpersonal relationships, social\nsolidarity, duties to one\u2019s community, acceptance of\nresponsibilities, a sense of belonging, and ties of fraternity and\ncommunity. (Marx 1844 [1987: 140\u2013142, 146\u2013147]; Taylor\n1985: 187\u2013210; Gutmann 1985; Waldron 1987b: 128\u2013129;\n1987c: 188). \n\nIn response, the protections, liberty, and empowerment that rights\nprovide become crucial to right-holders exactly when social and\ninterpersonal ties and solidarity break down, or turn discriminatory,\nor oppressively collectivist, or predatorial (Waldron 1987c:\n189\u2013190; Waldron 1993: 370\u2013391). Rights in this respect do\nnot derail community as such, but rather partake in forming\ncommunities that are morally legitimate (Finnis 2011: 210\u2013218;\nJones 1994: 209\u2013211). \n",
