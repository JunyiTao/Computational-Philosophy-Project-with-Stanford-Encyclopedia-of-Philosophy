    "main_text": "Beyond the Black/White Binary, Beyond Double Consciousness || White Double Consciousness\n5.2 White Double Consciousness\n\nA similar argument about the applicability of Du Bois\u2019s notion\nto \u2018white folk\u2019, in the American vortex, is presented by\nLinda Alcoff. In The Future of Whiteness (2015), she claims\nthat many white Americans are subject to \u2018white double\nconsciousness\u2019 due in part to recent social changes. The\nbook\u2019s argument \u2013 part of an anti-racist \u2018project to\nrearticulate whiteness\u2019 \u2013 describes what she calls the\n\u2018crisis of white hegemony\u2019 and the pressure exerted by\nthis crisis on white individuals\u2019 racial identity and\nself-understanding. Her account specifically addresses the\ndisaffection of many \u2018progressive\u2019 whites from the\ndominant, mainstream cultural form of whiteness, and from its\njustification by what she calls \u2018white vanguardism,\u2019 a\nfalse historical narrative of a decidedly racist cast. (Alcoff notes\nthe existence, but foregoes the analysis, of a reactionary, right-wing\nwhite double consciousness, claiming it lacks any significant\nfact-based theoretical basis for critical argument.) White double\nconsciousness is a specific kind of disaffection with whiteness, an\nalienation from whiteness as norm, \u201ca turmoil in white\nsubjectivity\u201d (174).\n\nThe crisis of white hegemony results partly from demographic changes\nunder way that will transform the U.S. into a\n\u2018minority-majority\u2019 society by mid-century, and an\nacknowledgment of these impending changes by white Americans still\nable and willing to face social reality. These demographic shifts\nportend a shifting spectrum of political contestation. Citing the work\nof historian Nell Irvin Painter charting the historic formation of\nwhiteness, Alcoff\u2019s argument identifies other broader social and\npolitical changes to U.S. society that track what might be called\n\u2018the declining significance of whiteness\u2019. These include a\ndiminished capacity of white identity to secure for its possessors the\ndifferential advantages once available to them; an increasing\ncontestation in the terms of public discourse on race, given changes\nin the federal government\u2019s identification and counting of race\ncategories, and recent theoretical uncertainties in academic and\njournalistic writing about race categories; a declining possibility of\nliving in whites-only communities and for restricting one\u2019s\ndaily life to segregated spaces; the end of state-sanctioned racial\nhierarchy, enabling the increasing openness of new generations of\nwhites to interracial contact, interaction, relationships, families,\nand multiracial community.\n\nAlcoff\u2019s focus on these and other actual social conditions\nforming the matrix for white double consciousness resembles Du\nBois\u2019s own increasing attention to the \u2018environing\nconditions\u2019 materially grounding changes in double consciousness\nin the developing century of his life. Whiteness is not an ideology\nfor Alcoff, but an \u2018organically emergent\u2019 social reality.\nAlcoff takes as a given both the fluidity of all such racial\ndeterminations of identity and the relative stability of the lived,\nmaterial reality of whiteness. Her broader account is aimed to counter\nrecent arguments that whiteness is too closely tied to white supremacy\nin its origins and motivations to be freed from its racist past, on\nthe one hand, and, on the other, that it is an ideological formation\nwhich can be simply given up and left behind as part of the struggle\nto overcome that historic legacy. Rejecting these claims, she argues\nwhiteness may well be de-linked from racism and white supremacy, a\npossibility that white double consciousness prefigures in its\nspecific, binary form.\n\nThe ideology of \u2018white vanguardism,\u2019 which Alcoff\ncharacterizes as the \u201cillusion \u2026 that has configured\nEuropean whites as the scientific, technological, moral, artistic, and\npolitical leader of the human race\u201d (24), has increasingly lost\nplausibility to significant numbers of whites themselves. This\n\u2018illusion,\u2019 which once supplied some sense of dignity and\nsocial standing to the many whites without other cultural or economic\nresources, has been increasingly contested both in the academy and the\npublic forum, and is at odds with changing social realities. Thus,\nwhite double consciousness is a growing reflection in significant\nsections of the population of the deep crisis of whiteness. At the\nsame time, Alcoff argues, whites affected with double consciousness\nare living out their disillusion with their own previous white\nvanguardist assumptions.\n\nAlcoff relies on a variety of sources to support her account. These\ninclude, in addition to philosophical critiques of the racial\nformation and of whiteness, ethnographic studies of local white\ncommunities, narrative accounts of anti-racist and anti-klan activists\nin the South and episodes from her own life and experience. She\npresents as a paradigmatic case the \u2018Beat\u2019 writer Jack\nKerouac \u2013 who exemplified the anxiety about whiteness in the\nform of a lived creative artistic rebellion, one nonetheless\nidentified by the culture as racially white. Alcoff characterizes\nKerouac as exhibiting such white double consciousness in his\ndeportment and self-presentation, saying that his \u2018alienated\nconsciousness\u2019 \u201cmanifested as discomfort with his embodied\nidentity.\u201d She adds that:\n\n\nJack Kerouac expressed a poignant alienation from his white identity\nand the general normative whiteness of heterosexual suburbia, and he\nemphatically identified with the more intense existential registers of\nnonwhite affect that he took to be common among African Americans and\nMexicans. (169)\n\n\nAnother noteworthy example is the description by Simone de Beauvoir of\nher own experience, during a visit with Richard Wright in New York, as\na white person walking through Harlem and experiencing a measure of\ndiscomfort on confronting the accusatory glances of the\nneighborhood\u2019s residents. \u201cBeauvoir notes the hostile\nglances and feels herself \u2018stiffen with a bad\nconscience\u2019\u201d (139). This provides Alcoff with an example\nillustrating the role that reactive emotions such as guilt and shame\ncan have in triggering the formation of white double consciousness.\nSuch encounters with racialized others in conditions of daily life can\nprod whites into seeing the disparity between how they view themselves\nand how they are seen outside of their own segregated communities, as\nthey begin to \u201cintuit how they are viewed by nonwhite\nothers\u201d (170). For many whites, Alcoff argues, the guilt and\ndiscomfort with whiteness which results provokes a critical rethinking\nand attempt to reshape their identity even as, for others, it drives a\ndesire to escape the attribution of racial whiteness altogether, an\nultimately dead-end path.\n\nA growing disaffection with the mainstream condition of whiteness\n\u2013 and with its dependence on the ideology of \u2018white\nvanguardism\u2019 \u2013 is the core of white double consciousness\nfor Alcoff. It is linked, for many whites, with a close daily lived\nassociation with communities of brown and black people. Nonetheless,\nan honest, fact-based and realistic approach to their lives requires\ntheir acknowledging the actuality of whiteness as their own personal\nracial identity and their understanding it as an historically shifting\nsocial construct. Acknowledging whiteness as a social construct\ninvolves both accepting its connection with historical and ongoing\nbrutal racial oppression and questioning its core ideology of white\nvanguardism. The double consciousness this acceptance/suspicion\nelicits involves, to some extent, a self-ascription of whiteness as\nidentity, a critical distance from it as a form of life, and a\nrejection of its \u2018white vanguardist\u2019 ideology as false,\nand falsely justifying continued white supremacy.\n\nWhite double consciousness can lead whites to a deeper understanding\nof the realities of U.S. social conditions and the history shaping\nthem. It thus represents a resource and potentially a trigger for\nworking through their false views about race and moving toward\nanti-racism. Unlike the case of black double consciousness \u2013\nwhich is the native understanding of their own lives, achieved through\nintraracial communal cultural associations and solidarities, that\nmakes possible blacks\u2019 understanding of the lies upholding white\ndomination \u2013 whites\u2019 double consciousness \u201cinvolves\ncoming to see themselves through both the dominant and non-dominant\nlens and recognizing the latter as a critical corrective truth\u201d\n(140).\n",
