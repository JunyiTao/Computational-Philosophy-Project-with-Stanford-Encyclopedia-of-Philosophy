    "main_text": "From Physiological to Evolutionary Individuals: Life, Reproduction, and Agency || Reproduction, Life Cycles, and Lineages\n6.2 Reproduction, Life Cycles, and Lineages\n\nOne feature of organismic, physiological individuals that partially\ndistinguishes them amongst living things is that they have life\ncycles that allow them to form reproductive lineages of a certain\nkind. The importance of life cycles for evolutionary change has been\nrecognized both in the replicator-based view of evolutionary\nindividuals (Dawkins 1989: ch.13) and in reproductively-centered\naccounts of Darwinian individuals (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2016a). And the\nclose relationship between being an individual organism and having a\nlife cycle is widely accepted, being manifested in an extreme form by\nGriffiths and Gray\u2019s (1994) identification of biological\nindividuals with their life cycles within developmental systems\ntheory.\n\nPut most generally, a life cycle is an intergenerationally replicable\nseries of events or stages through which a living thing passes (Bonner\n1993). These events or stages constitute a cycle in that they\nbegin and end with the same event, such as the formation of a\nfertilized egg in sexually reproducing individuals, or the creation of\na fissioned cell in clonally reproducing individuals.\nDevelopment is the global name for the processes that\ncausally mediate between these events or stages in a life cycle, with\nreproduction marking the transition to the creation of a new\nindividual, the offspring of one or more parents. Although Richard\nDawkins\u2019s suspicion \n\n\nthat the essential, defining feature of an individual organism\nis that it is a unit that begins and ends with a\nsingle-celled bottleneck (1989: 264) \n\n\nhas proven hyperbolic, the more cautious view that the \u201ctwo\nphenomena, bottlenecked life cycles and discrete organisms, go hand in\nhand\u201d (1989: 264) expresses a view that has been widely\nendorsed.\n\nIt has long been recognized that some biological individuals, such as\nflukes, have life cycles that take them literally through one or more\nhosts, and that many insects undergo significant metamorphic changes\nin bodily form through their life cycle. But such sophistications to\nlife cycles are only the tip of the iceberg here. While the stages\nthemselves often form standard sequences within particular species,\nthere can be tremendous variation across species and phyla in what a\ngiven individual\u2019s life cycle consists in, as others have\nemphasized (Buss 1987), including in recent discussions of complex\nlife cycles (Godfrey-Smith 2016b, 2016d; Griesemer 2016; Herron 2016; O\u2019Malley 2016; cf.\nGerber 2018). \n\nIn the life cycles that are most immediately familiar, processes that\nmark the end of one life cycle and the beginning of another of the\nsame kind of individual\u2014processes such as material\nbottlenecking, sexual reproduction, and\nmultiplication\u2014temporally coalesce. In the life cycles of other\nindividuals, such as ferns and scyphozoan jellyfish, these processes\nare sometimes dispersed, function differently, or are absent\n(Godfrey-Smith 2016a, 2016b). Such cases call for a corresponding\nsophistication of accounts of reproduction and, as James Griesemer\nsays, these complexities in life cycles may \n\n\ncomplicate relations between processes of development and reproduction\nto such an extent that even the meaning of \u2018organism\u2019\nbegins to break down. (Griesemer 2016: 804) \n\n\nMaureen O\u2019Malley (2016) has drawn attention to other cases that\npose more radical challenges to the standard ways of thinking of life\ncycles themselves. An example is the asexually reproducing,\nmulticellular protist Volvox carteri (green algae), whose\n\u201csexual phase of the life cycle is nonreproductive because there\nis no multiplication\u201d (O\u2019Malley 2016: 838). This kind of\nsexual recombination occurring between members of asexually\nreproducing generations takes on a striking form in ciliates, such as\nTetrahymena, whose micronucleus provides germ-line isolation.\nWhether O\u2019Malley\u2019s concept of multigenerational\nindividuals can be squared with extensions of standard views of\nreproduction and life cycles remains subject to further\nexploration.\n\nAlthough there is a relationship between having a life cycle and\nreproducing, simply reproducing is not the distinctive\nfeature here, as a number of authors have recognized (Griesemer 2014,\nGodfrey-Smith 2013, O\u2019Malley 2016, R.A. Wilson 2005). Organisms\nand perhaps other biological individuals typically reproduce through\nmaterial overlap (Griesemer 2000), or via bottlenecks requiring\nmaterial minimalization and mark the transition between generations\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: ch.5). These kinds of constraints on biological\nreproduction go hand in hand with growth and development as part of\nthe intergenerational life cycle of biological individuals.\nIntergenerational life cycles, in turn, make it possible for\nbiological individuals to form reproductive lineages of\nliving things. Reproduction structures not only such lineages, but\nalso the lineages of non-living biological individuals,\nwhether they be smaller than the individuals they are parts of (such\nas genes), or groups (such as populations) that feature centrally in\ndiscussions of evolutionary individuals.\n\nAlthough reproduction itself has sometimes been conceptualized as part\nof the life cycle of biological individuals, the role of reproduction\nin intergenerational life cycles in general requires more careful\narticulation. For there are many species in which only a small\nminority of individuals actually get to reproduce, with reproductive\nskew being a widespread feature. Meanwhile it seems clear that all of\nthese biological individuals, however much or little they reproduce,\nstill possess a life cycle. Note that even the capacity to\nreproduce is not a universal feature of life cycles. This is not only\nbecause the capacity itself may not be replicated, but also because\nthere are biological individuals designed by natural\nselection to be non-reproductive, with sterile castes in eusocial\ninsects being perhaps the best-known example. \n\nIn such species, a few individuals (e.g., queens) do most if not all\nof the direct reproductive labor, and many others are rendered\nreproductively sterile throughout all or much of their life (e.g.,\nworker castes). So there are reasons to include neither reproduction\nnor the capacity to reproduce as part of the generic life cycle of\nbiological individuals. What is true, however, is that all organisms\nhave life cycles that allow them to form reproductive lineages. They\ndo so sometimes through the reproductive activity of members of the\nlineage to which they belong, even if not every member of that lineage\nreproduces or even can reproduce. Like viruses, individual members of\nsterile castes of insects rely on the reproductive machinery of\nothers in order for descendant members of those castes to be\nreproduced in future generations.\n\nThis is an example of what Godfrey-Smith (2009: ch.5) calls\nscaffolded reproducers, \u201centities which get reproduced\nas part of the reproduction of some larger unit\u201d and whose\n\u201creproduction is dependent on an elaborate scaffolding of some\nkind that is external to them\u201d (2009: 88). These contrast with\nwhat he calls simple reproducers, a paradigm of which is a\nbacterial cell, being \u201cthe lowest-level entities that can\nreproduce largely \u2018under their own steam\u2019\u201d (2009:\n88). Both simple and scaffolded reproducers can be parts of what\nGodfrey-Smith calls collective reproducers, which are \n\n\nreproducing entities with parts that themselves have the capacity to\nreproduce \u2026 largely through their own [the parts\u2019]\nresources rather than through the coordinated activity of the whole.\n(2009: 87) \n\n\nBoth groups and multicellular organisms exemplify collective\nreproduction, and Godfrey-Smith\u2019s discussion of the continuous\ndimensional space that characterizes collective reproducers, and\nDarwinian individuals more generally, has been influential, and is\nsummarily depicted in\n Figure 4\n below. \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Godfrey-Smith\u2019s\nDimensional Space for Collective Reproduction.
