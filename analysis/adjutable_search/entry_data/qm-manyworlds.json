    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nThe fundamental idea of the MWI, going back to Everett 1957, is that\nthere are myriads of worlds in the Universe in addition to the world\nwe are aware of. In particular, every time a quantum experiment with\ndifferent possible outcomes is performed, all outcomes are obtained,\neach in a different newly created world, even if we are only aware of\nthe world with the outcome we have seen. The reader can split the\nworld right now using this interactive\n quantum world splitter.\n The creation of worlds takes place everywhere, not just in physics\nlaboratories, for example, the explosion of a star during a\nsupernova.\n\nThere are numerous variations and reinterpretations of the original\nEverett proposal, most of which are briefly discussed in the entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics.\n Here, a particular approach to the MWI (which differs from the\npopular \u201cactual splitting worlds\u201d approach in De Witt\n1970) will be presented in detail, followed by a discussion relevant\nfor many variants of the MWI.\n\nThe MWI consists of two parts:\n\nA theory which yields the time evolution of the quantum state of\nthe (single) Universe.\nA prescription which sets up a correspondence between the quantum\nstate of the Universe and our experiences.\n\n\nPart (i) states that the ontology of the universe is a quantum state,\nwhich evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or its\nrelativistic generalization. It is a rigorous mathematical theory and\nis not problematic philosophically. Part (ii) involves \u201cour\nexperiences\u201d which do not have a rigorous definition. An\nadditional difficulty in setting up (ii) follows from the fact that\nhuman languages were developed at a time when people did not suspect\nthe existence of parallel worlds.\n\nThe mathematical part of the MWI, (i), yields less than mathematical\nparts of some other theories such as Bohmian mechanics. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation itself does not explain why we experience\ndefinite results in quantum measurements. In contrast, in Bohmian\nmechanics the mathematical part yields almost everything, and the\nanalog of (ii) is very simple: it is the postulate according to which\nonly the \u201cBohmian positions\u201d (and not the quantum wave)\ncorrespond to our experience. The Bohmian positions of all particles\nyield the familiar picture of the (single) world we are aware of. The\nsimplicity of part (ii) of Bohmian mechanics comes at the price of\nadding problematic physical features to part (i), e.g., the nonlocal\ndynamics of Bohmian trajectories.\n2. Definitions\n2.1 What is \u201cA World\u201d?\n\nA world is the totality of macroscopic objects: stars, cities,\npeople, grains of sand, etc. in a definite classically described\nstate.\n\n\nThe concept of a \u201cworld\u201d in the MWI belongs to part (ii)\nof the theory, i.e., it is not a rigorously defined mathematical\nentity, but a term defined by us (sentient beings) to describe our\nexperience. When we refer to the \u201cdefinite classically described\nstate\u201d of, say, a cat, it means that the position and the state\n(alive, dead, smiling, etc.) of the cat is specified according to our\nability to distinguish between the alternatives, and that this\nspecification corresponds to a classical picture, e.g., no\nsuperpositions of dead and alive cats are allowed in a single\nworld.\n\nAnother concept, which is closer to Everett\u2019s original proposal,\nsee Saunders 1995, is that of a relative, or perspectival world\ndefined for every physical system and every one of its states:\nfollowing Lewis 1986 we call it a centered world. This\nconcept is useful when a world is centered on a perceptual state of a\nsentient being. In this world, all objects which the sentient being\nperceives have definite states, but objects that are not under\nobservation might be in a superposition of different (classical)\nstates. The advantage of a centered world is that a quantum phenomenon\nin a distant galaxy does not split it, while the advantage of the\ndefinition presented here is that we can consider a world without\nspecifying a center; our usual language is just as useful for\ndescribing worlds that existed at times when there were no sentient\nbeings.\n\nThe concept of a world in the MWI is based on the layman\u2019s\nconception of a world; however, several features are different.\nObviously, the definition of the world as everything that\nexists does not hold in the MWI. \u201cEverything that\nexists\u201d is the Universe, and there is only one Universe. The\nUniverse incorporates many worlds similar to the one the layman is\nfamiliar with. A layman believes that our present world has a unique\npast and future. According to the MWI, a world defined at some moment\nof time corresponds to a unique world at a time in the past, but to a\nmultitude of worlds at a time in the future.\n2.2 Who am I?\n\nI am an object, such as the Earth, a cat, etc. \u201cI\u201d is\ndefined at a particular time by a complete (classical) description of\nthe state of my body and of my brain. \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cLev\u201d do not refer to the same things (even though my name\nis Lev). At the present moment there are many different\n\u201cLev\u201ds in different worlds (not more than one in each\nworld), but it is meaningless to say that now there is another\n\u201cI\u201d. I have a particular, well defined past: I correspond\nto a particular \u201cLev\u201d in 2020, but not to a particular\n\u201cLev\u201d in the future: I correspond to a multitude of\n\u201cLev\u201ds in 2030. This correspondence is seen in my memory\nof a unique past: a \u201cLev\u201d in 2021 shares memories with one\nparticular \u201cLev\u201d in 2020 but with multiple\n\u201cLev\u201ds in 2030. In the framework of the MWI it is\nmeaningless to ask: Which \u201cLev\u201d in 2030 will I be? I will\ncorrespond to them all. Every time I perform a quantum experiment\n(with several outcomes) it only seems to me that a single definite\nresult is obtained. Indeed, the \u201cLev\u201d who obtains this\nparticular result thinks this way. However, this \u201cLev\u201d\ncannot be identified as the only \u201cLev\u201d after the\nexperiment. The \u201cLev\u201d before the experiment corresponds to\nmultiple \u201cLev\u201ds who obtain all possible results.\n\nAlthough this approach to the concept of personal identity seems\nsomewhat unusual, it is plausible in the light of the critique of\npersonal identity by Parfit 1986. Parfit considers some artificial\nsituations in which a person splits into several copies, and argues\nthat there is no good answer to the question: \u201cWhich copy is\nme?\u201d He concludes that personal identity is not what matters\nwhen the observer divides. Saunders and Wallace 2008a argue that based\non the semantics of Lewis 1986 one can find a meaning for this\nquestion. However, in their reply (Saunders and Wallace 2008b) to\nTappenden 2008 they emphasise that their work is not about the nature\nof \u201cI\u201d, but about \u201cserviceability\u201d. Indeed, as\nit will be explained below, I should behave as if \u201cWhich copy is\nme?\u201d is a legitimate question.\n3. Correspondence Between the Formalism and Our Experience\n\nWe should not expect to have a detailed and complete explanation of\nour experience in terms of the wave function of \\(10^{33}\\) particles\nthat we and our immediate environment are made of. We just have to be\nable to draw a basic picture which is free of paradoxes. There are\nmany attempts to provide an explanation of what we see based on the\nMWI or its variants in Lockwood 1989, Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990,\nAlbert 1992, Saunders 1993, Penrose 1994, Chalmers 1996, Deutsch 1996,\nJoos et al. 2003, Schlosshauer 2007, Wallace 2012, Cunningham\n2014, Vaidman 2016a, Zurek 2018, Vaidman 2019, and Tappenden 2019a. A\nsketch of the connection between the wave function of the Universe and\nour experience follows.\n3.1 The Quantum State of a Macroscopic Object\n\nThe basis for the correspondence between the quantum state (the wave\nfunction) of the Universe and our experience is the description that\nphysicists give in the framework of standard quantum theory for\nobjects composed of elementary particles. Elementary particles of the\nsame kind are identical (see the elaborate discussion in the entry on\n identity and individuality in quantum theory).\n The essence of an object is the (massively entangled) quantum state\nof its particles and not the particles themselves. One quantum state\nof a set of elementary particles might be a cat and another state of\nthe same particles might be a small table. An object is a spatial\npattern of such a quantum state. Clearly, we cannot now write down an\nexact wave function of a cat. We know, to a reasonable approximation,\nthe wave function of the elementary particles that constitute a\nnucleon. The wave function of the electrons and the nucleons that\ntogether make up an atom is known with even better precision. The wave\nfunctions of molecules (i.e. the wave functions of the ions and\nelectrons out of which molecules are built) are well studied. A lot is\nknown about biological cells, and physicists are making progress in\nthe quantum representation of biological systems Cao et. al 2020. Out\nof cells we construct various tissues and then the whole body of a cat\nor a table. So, let us denote the quantum state of a macroscopic\nobject constructed in this way \\(\\ket{\\Psi}_\\object.\\)\n\nIn our construction \\(\\ket{\\Psi}_\\object\\) represents an object in a\ndefinite state and position. According to the definition of a world we\nhave adopted, in each world the cat is in a definite state: either\nalive or dead. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s experiment with the cat leads\nto a splitting of worlds even before opening the box. Note that in the\ncentered world approach, the superposed Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat\nis a member of the single world of the observer before she opens the\nsealed box with the cat. The observer directly perceives the facts\nrelated to the experiment and deduces that the cat is in a\nsuperposition.\n\nFormally, the quantum state of an object which consists of \\(N\\)\nparticles is defined in \\(3N\\) dimensional configuration space, see\nAlbert 1996, 2015. However, in order to understand our experience, it\nis crucial to make a connection to \\(3\\) dimensional space, see Stoica\n2019. We only experience objects defined in \\(3D\\)-space. The causes\nof our experience are interactions, and in nature there are only local\ninteractions in three spatial dimensions. These interactions can be\nexpressed as couplings to some macroscopic variables of the object\ndescribed by quantum waves well localized in \\(3D\\)-space, which are\nin a product with the relative variables state of the object (like\nentangled electrons in atoms) and other parts of the object, see\nVaidman 2019 (Sec. 5.6). Another way to bridge between the wave\nfunction of the object and our experience of that object is the\nthree-dimensional picture of the density of the wave function of\nmolecules of the macroscopic object which has the familiar geometrical\nform of the object. Note that in some other interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, similar densities are given additional ontological\nsignificance (Allori et al. 2014.)\n3.2 The Quantum State of a World\n\nThe wave function of all particles in the Universe corresponding to\nany particular world will be a product of the states of the sets of\nparticles corresponding to all objects in the world multiplied by the\nquantum state \\(\\ket{\\Phi}\\) of all the particles that do not\nconstitute \u201cobjects\u201d. Within a world,\n\u201cobjects\u201d have definite macroscopic states by fiat:\n\n\\[\\tag{1} \\ket{\\Psi_\\world} = \\ket{\\Psi}_{\\object\\ 1} \\ket{\\Psi}_{\\object\\ 2} \\cdots \\ket{\\Psi}_{\\object\\ N} \\ket{\\Phi} \\]\n\n\nThe product state is only for variables which are relevant for the\nmacroscopic description of the objects. There might be some\nentanglement between weakly coupled variables like nuclear spins\nbelonging to different objects. In order to keep the form of the\nquantum state of the world (1), the quantum state of such variables\nshould belong to \\(\\ket{\\Phi}.\\)\n\nConsider a text-book description of quantum measurements based on the\nvon Neumann 1955 approach according to which each quantum measurement\nends up with the collapse of the wave function to the eigenstate of\nthe measured variable. The quantum measurement device must be a\nmacroscopic object with macroscopically different states corresponding\nto different outcomes. In this case, the MWI all-particles wave\nfunction corresponding to a world with a particular outcome is the\nsame as in the von Neumann theory provided there is a collapse to the\nwave function with this outcome. The von Neumann 1955 analysis helps in\nunderstanding the correspondence between the wave function and our\nperception of the world. However, as Becker 2004 explains, the status\nof the wave function for von Neumann is not ontological as in the MWI\ndescribed here, but epistemic: it summarises information about the\nresults of measurements.\n\nIn most situations, only macroscopic objects are relevant to our\nexperience. However, today\u2019s technology has reached a point in\nwhich interference experiments are performed with single particles. In\nsuch situations a description of a world with states of only\nmacroscopic objects, such as sources and detectors, is possible but\ncumbersome. Hence it is fruitful to add a description of some\nmicroscopic objects. Vaidman 2010 argues that the proper way to\ndescribe the relevant microscopic particles is by the two-state vector\nwhich consists of the usual, forward evolving state specified by the\nmeasurement in the past and a backward evolving state specified by the\nmeasurement in the future. Such a description provides a simple\nexplanation of the weak trace the particles leave, Vaidman 2013.\n3.3 The Quantum State of the Universe\n\nThe quantum state of the Universe (i.e. the Universal wave function)\ncan be decomposed into a superposition of terms corresponding to\ndifferent worlds: \n\n\\[\\tag{2} \\ket{\\Psi_\\universe} = \\sum \\alpha_i \\ket{\\Psi_{\\world\\ i}} \\]\n\n\nDifferent worlds correspond to different classically described states\nof at least one object. Different classically described states\ncorrespond to orthogonal quantum states. Therefore, different worlds\ncorrespond to orthogonal states: all states \\(\\ket{\\Psi_{\\world\\ i}}\\)\nare mutually orthogonal and consequently, \\(\\sum\n\\lvert\\alpha_i\\rvert^2 = 1\\) (here we include as a \u201cworld\u201d\na situation in which there are no macroscopic objects).\n3.4 FAPP\n\nThe construction of the quantum state of the Universe in terms of the\nquantum states of objects presented above is only approximate; it is\ngood only for all practical purposes (FAPP). Indeed, the\nconcept of an object itself has no rigorous definition: should a mouse\nthat a cat just swallowed be considered as a part of the cat? The\nconcept of a \u201cdefinite position\u201d is also only\napproximately defined: how far should a cat be displaced for it to be\nconsidered to exist in a different position? If the displacement is\nmuch smaller than the quantum uncertainty, it must be considered to\nexist in the same place, because in this case the quantum state of the\ncat is almost the same and the displacement is undetectable in\nprinciple. But this is only an absolute bound, because our ability to\ndistinguish various locations of the cat is far from this quantum\nlimit. Furthermore, the state of an object (e.g. alive or dead) is\nmeaningful only if the object is considered for a period of time. In\nour construction, however, the quantum state of an object is defined\nat a particular time. In fact, we have to ensure that the quantum\nstate will have the shape of the object not only at that time, but for\nsome period of time. Splitting of the world during this period of time\nis another source of ambiguity because there is no precise definition\nof when the splitting occurs. The time of splitting corresponds to the\ntime of the collapse in the approach given by von Neumann 1955. He\nprovided a very extensive discussion showing that it does not matter\nwhen exactly the collapse occurs, and this analysis shows also that it\ndoes not matter when the splitting in the MWI occurs.\n\nThe reason that it is possible to propose only an approximate\nprescription for the correspondence between the quantum state of the\nUniverse and our experience is essentially the same reason for the\nclaim of Bell 1990 that \u201cordinary quantum mechanics is just fine\nFAPP\u201d. The concepts we use: \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d, etc. are not rigorously defined. Bell and\nmany others were looking (until now in vain) for a \u201cprecise\nquantum mechanics\u201d. Since it is not enough for a physical theory\nto be just fine FAPP, a quantum mechanics needs rigorous foundations.\nThe MWI has rigorous foundations for (i), the \u201cphysics\npart\u201d of the theory; only part (ii), corresponding to our\nexperience, is approximate (just fine FAPP). But \u201cjust fine\nFAPP\u201d means that the theory explains our experience for any\npossible experiment, and this is the goal of (ii). See Wallace 2002,\n2010a, 2012 for more arguments why a FAPP definition of a world is\nenough.\n3.5 Preferred Basis\n\nThe mathematical structure of the theory (i) allows infinitely many\nways to decompose the quantum state of the Universe into a\nsuperposition of orthogonal states. The basis for the decomposition\ninto world states follows from the definition of a world composed of\nobjects in definite positions and states (\u201cdefinite\u201d on\nthe scale of our ability to distinguish them). In the alternative\napproach, the basis of a centered world is defined directly by an\nobserver. Therefore, given the nature of the observer and her concepts\nfor describing the world, the particular choice of the decomposition\n(2) follows (up to a precision which is good FAPP, as required). If we\ndo not ask why we are what we are, and why the world we perceive is\nwhat it is, but only how we can explain relations between the events\nwe observe in our world, then the problem of the preferred basis does\nnot arise: we and the concepts of our world define the preferred\nbasis.\n\nBut if we do ask why we are what we are, we can explain more. Looking\nat the details of the physical world, the structure of the\nHamiltonian, the value of the Planck constant, etc., one can\nunderstand why the sentient beings we know are of a particular type\nand why they have their particular concepts for describing their\nworlds. The main argument is that the locality of interactions yields\nthe stability of worlds in which objects are well localized. The\nsmall value of the Planck constant allows macroscopic objects to be\nwell localized for a long period of time. Worlds corresponding to\nlocalized quantum states \\(\\ket{\\Psi_{\\world\\ i}}\\) do not split for a\nlong enough time such that sentient beings can perceive the locations\nof macroscopic objects. By contrast, a \u201cworld\u201d obtained in\nanother decomposition, e.g., the \u201cworld +\u201d which is\ncharacterized by the relative phase of a superposition of states of\nmacroscopic objects being in macroscopically distinguishable states\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\ket{\\Psi_A} +\n\\ket{\\Psi_B})\\ket{\\Phi},\\) splits immediately, during a period of time\nwhich is much smaller than the perception time of any feasible\nsentient being, into two worlds: the new \u201cworld+\u201d and the\n\u201cworld\\(-\\)\u201d:\n\\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\,(\\ket{\\Psi_A}-\\ket{\\Psi_B})\\ket{\\Phi'}.\\) This is the\nphenomenon of\n decoherence\n which has attracted enormous attention in recent years, e.g., Joos\net al. 2003, Zurek 2003, Schlosshauer 2007, Wallace 2012,\nRiedel 2017, Schlosshauer 2019, Boge 2019, Saunders forthcoming-a also in the\n\u201cdecoherent histories\u201d framework of Gell-Mann and Hartle\n1990, see Saunders 1995 and Riedel et al.2016.\n3.6 The Measure of Existence\n\nThere are many worlds existing in parallel in the Universe. Although\nall worlds are of the same physical size (this might not be true if we\ntake into account the quantum aspects of early cosmology), and in\nevery world sentient beings feel as \u201creal\u201d as in any other\nworld, there is a sense in which some worlds are larger than others.\nVaidman 1998 describes this property as the measure of\nexistence of a world.\n\nThere are two aspects of the measure of existence of a world. First,\nit quantifies the ability of the world to interfere with other worlds\nin a gedanken experiment, as expounded at the end of this section.\nSecond, the measure of existence is the basis for introducing an\nillusion of probability in the MWI as described in the next\nchapter. The measure of existence is the parallel of the probability\nmeasure discussed in Everett 1957 and pictorially described in\nLockwood 1989 (p. 230).\n\nGiven the decomposition (2), the measure of existence of the world\n\\(i\\) is \\(\\mu_i = \\lvert \\alpha_i\\rvert^2.\\) It can also be expressed\nas the expectation value of \\(\\mathbf{P}_i\\), the projection operator\non the space of quantum states corresponding to the actual values of\nall physical variables describing the world \\(i\\): \n\n\\[\\tag{3} \\mu_i = \\langle \\Psi_\\universe \\mid \\mathbf{P}_i \\mid\n\\Psi_\\universe \\rangle. \\]\n\n\nNote, that although the measure of existence of a world is expressed\nusing the quantum state of the Universe (2), the concept of measure of\nexistence, as the concept of a world belongs to part (ii) of the MWI,\nthe bridge to our experience.\n\n\u201cI\u201d also have a measure of existence. It is the sum of the\nmeasures of existence of all different worlds in which I exist. Note\nthat I do not directly experience the measure of my existence. I feel\nthe same weight, see the same brightness, etc. irrespectively of how\ntiny my measure of existence might be.\n\nMy current measure of existence is relevant only for gedanken\nsituations like Wigner\u2019s friend Wigner 1961 (recently revived by\nFrauchiger and Renner 2018) which demonstrates the meaning of the measure\nof existence of a world as a measure of its ability to interfere with\nother worlds. If I am a friend of Wigner, a gedanken superpower who\ncan perform interference experiments with macroscopic objects like\npeople, and I perform an experiment with two outcomes A and B such\nthat two worlds will be created with different measures of existence,\nsay \\(2\\mu_{A}= \\mu_{B}\\), then there is a difference between Lev A\nand Lev B in how Wigner can affect their future through the\ninterference of worlds. Both Lev A and Lev B consider performing a new\nexperiment with the same device. Wigner can interfere the worlds in\nsuch a way that Lev A (the one with a smaller measure of existence) will\nnot have the future with result A of the second experiment. However,\nWigner cannot prevent the future result A from Lev B, see Vaidman 1998\n(p. 256).\n4. Probability in the MWI\n\nThe probability in the MWI cannot be introduced in a simple way as in\nquantum theory with collapse. However, even if there is no probability\nin the MWI, it is possible to explain our illusion of apparent\nprobabilistic events. Due to the identity of the mathematical\ncounterparts of worlds, we should not expect any difference between\nour experience in a particular world of the MWI and the experience in\na single-world universe with collapse at every quantum\nmeasurement.\n4.1 Probability from Uncertainty\n\nThe difficulty with the concept of probability in a deterministic\ntheory, such as the MWI, is that the only possible meaning for\nprobability is an ignorance probability, but there is no\nrelevant information that an observer who is going to perform a\nquantum experiment is ignorant about. The quantum state of the\nUniverse at one time specifies the quantum state at all times. If I am\ngoing to perform a quantum experiment with two possible outcomes such\nthat standard quantum mechanics predicts probability 1/3 for outcome A\nand 2/3 for outcome B, then, according to the MWI, both the world with\noutcome A and the world with outcome B will exist. It is senseless to\nask: \u201cWhat is the probability that I will get A instead of\nB?\u201d because I will correspond to both \u201cLev\u201ds: the\none who observes A and the other one who observes B.\n\nTo solve this difficulty, Albert and Loewer 1988 proposed the Many\nMinds interpretation (in which the different worlds are only in the\nminds of sentient beings). In addition to the quantum wave of the\nUniverse, Albert and Loewer postulate that every sentient being has a\ncontinuum of minds. Whenever the quantum wave of the Universe develops\ninto a superposition containing states of a sentient being\ncorresponding to different perceptions, the minds of this sentient\nbeing evolve randomly and independently to mental states corresponding\nto these different states of perception (with probabilities equal to\nthe quantum probabilities for these states). In particular, whenever a\nmeasurement is performed by an observer, the observer\u2019s minds\ndevelop mental states that correspond to perceptions of the different\noutcomes, i.e. corresponding to the worlds A or B in our example.\nSince there is a continuum of minds, there will always be an infinity\nof minds in any sentient being and the procedure can continue\nindefinitely. This resolves the difficulty: each \u201cI\u201d\ncorresponds to one mind and it ends up in a state corresponding to a\nworld with a particular outcome. However, this solution comes at the\nprice of introducing additional structure into the theory, including a\ngenuinely random process.\n\nSaunders 2010 claims to solve the problem without introducing\nadditional structure into the theory. Working in the Heisenberg\npicture, he uses appropriate semantics and mereology according to\nwhich distinct worlds have no parts in common, not even at early times\nwhen the worlds are qualitatively identical. In the terminology of\nLewis 1986 (p. 206) we have the divergence of worlds rather than\noverlap. Wilson 2013, 2020 develops this idea by introducing a\nframework called \u201cindexicalism\u201d, which involves a set of\ndistinct diverging \u201cparallel\u201d worlds in which each\nobserver is located in only one world and all propositions are\nconstrued as self-locating (indexical). In Wilson\u2019s words,\n\u201cindexicalism\u201d allows us to vindicate treating the weights\nas a candidate objective probability measure. However, it is\nnot clear how this program can succeed, see Marchildon 2015, Harding\n2020, Tappenden 2019a. It is hard to identify diverging worlds in our\nexperience and there is nothing in the mathematical formalism of\nstandard quantum mechanics which can be a counterpart of diverging\nworlds, see also Kent 2010 (p. 345). In the next section, the measure\nof existence of worlds is related to subjective ignorance\nprobability.\n\nThere are more proposals to deal with the issue of probability in the\nMWI. Barrett 2017 argues that for a derivation of the Probability\nPostulate it is necessary to add some assumptions to unitary\nevolution. For example, Weissman 1999 has proposed a modification of\nquantum theory with additional non-linear decoherence (and hence with\neven more worlds than in the standard MWI) which can lead\nasymptotically to worlds of equal mean measure for different outcomes.\nHanson 2003, 2006 proposed decoherence dynamics in which observers of\ndifferent worlds \u201cmangle\u201d each other such that an\napproximate Born rule is obtained. Van Wesep 2006 used an algebraic\nmethod for deriving the probability rule, whereas Buniy et\nal. 2006 used the decoherent histories approach of Gell-Mann and\nHartle 1990. Waegell and McQueen 2020 considered probability based on\nthe ontology of `local worlds\u2019 introduced by Waegell 2018, which\nis a concept inspired by the approach of Deutsch and Hayden 2000.\n4.2 Illusion of Probability from Post-Measurement Uncertainty\n\nVaidman 1998 introduced the ignorance probability of an agent in the\nframework of the MWI in a situation of post-measurement\nuncertainty, see also Tappenden 2011, Vaidman 2012, Tipler 2014,\n2019b, Schwarz 2015. It seems senseless to ask: \u201cWhat is the\nprobability that Lev in the world \\(A\\) will observe \\(A\\)?\u201d\nThis probability is trivially equal to 1. The task is to define the\nprobability in such a way that we could reconstruct the prediction of\nthe standard approach, where the probability for \\(A\\) is 1/3. It is\nindeed senseless to ask you what is the probability that Lev\nin the world \\(A\\) will observe \\(A\\), but this might be a meaningful\nquestion when addressed to Lev in the world of the outcome \\(A\\).\nUnder normal circumstances, the world \\(A\\) is created (i.e. measuring\ndevices and objects which interact with measuring devices become\nlocalized according to the outcome \\(A)\\) before Lev is aware of the\nresult \\(A\\). Then, it is sensible to ask this Lev about his\nprobability of being in world \\(A\\). There is a definite outcome which\nthis Lev will see, but he is ignorant of this outcome at the time of\nthe question. In order to make this point vivid, Vaidman 1998 proposed\nan experiment in which the experimenter is given a sleeping pill\nbefore the experiment. Then, while asleep, he is moved to room \\(A\\)\nor to room \\(B\\) depending on the results of the experiment. When the\nexperimenter has woken up (in one of the rooms), but before he has\nopened his eyes, he is asked \u201cIn which room are you?\u201d\nCertainly, there is a matter of fact about which room he is in (he can\nlearn about it by opening his eyes), but he is ignorant about this\nfact at the time of the question.\n\nThis construction provides the ignorance interpretation of\nprobability, but the value of the probability has to be\npostulated:\n\nProbability Postulate\n\nAn observer should set his subjective probability of the outcome of a\nquantum experiment in proportion to the total measure of existence of\nall worlds with that outcome.\n\nThis postulate (named the Born-Vaidman rule by Tappenden\n2011) is a counterpart of the collapse postulate of the standard\nquantum mechanics according to which, after a measurement, the quantum\nstate collapses to a particular branch with probability proportional\nto its squared amplitude. (See the section on the measurement problem\nin the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.)\n However, it differs in two aspects. First, it parallels only the\nsecond part of the collapse postulate, the Born Rule, and second, it\nis related only to part (ii) of the MWI, the connection to our\nexperience, and not to the mathematical part of the theory (i).\n\nThe question of the probability of obtaining A makes sense for Lev in\nworld A before he becomes aware of the outcome and for Lev in world B\nbefore he becomes aware of the outcome. Both \u201cLev\u201ds have\nthe same information on the basis of which they should give their\nanswer. According to the probability postulate they will give the\nsame answer: 1/3 (the relative measure of existence of the\nworld \\(A)\\). Since Lev before the measurement is associated with two\n\u201cLev\u201ds after the measurement who have identical ignorance\nprobability concepts for the outcome of the experiment, one can define\nthe probability of the outcome of the experiment to be performed as\nthe ignorance probability of the successors of Lev for being in a\nworld with a particular outcome.\n\nThe \u201csleeping pill\u201d argument does not reduce the\nprobability of an outcome of a quantum experiment to a familiar\nconcept of probability in the classical context. The quantum situation\nis genuinely different. Since all outcomes of a quantum experiment are\nrealized, there is no probability in the usual sense. Nevertheless,\nthis construction explains the illusion of probability. It leads\nbelievers in the MWI to behave according to the following\nprinciple:\n\nBehavior Principle\n\nWe care about all our successive worlds in proportion to their\nmeasures of existence.\n\nWith this principle our behavior should be similar to the behavior of\na believer in the collapse theory who cares about possible future\nworlds in proportion to the probability of their occurrence.\n\nThe important part of the Probability Postulate is the supervenience\nof subjective probability on the measure of existence. Given this\nsupervenience, the proportionality follows naturally from the\nfollowing argument. By the assumption, if after a quantum measurement\nall the worlds have equal measures of existence, the probability of a\nparticular outcome is simply proportional to the number of worlds with\nthis outcome. The measures of existence of worlds are, in general, not\nequal, but the experimenters in all the worlds can perform additional\nspecially tailored auxiliary measurements of some variables such that\nall the new worlds will have equal measures of existence. The\nexperimenters should be completely indifferent to the results of these\nauxiliary measurements: their only purpose is to split the worlds into\n\u201cequal-weight\u201d worlds. Then, the additivity of the measure\nof existence yields the Probability Postulate.\n\nThere are many other arguments (apart from the empirical evidence)\nsupporting the Probability Postulate. Gleason\u2019s 1957 theorem\nabout the uniqueness of the probability measure uses a natural\nprinciple that the probability of an outcome is independent of splitting\ninto parallel worlds. Tappenden 2000, 2017 adopts a different semantics\naccording to which \u201cI\u201d live in all branches and have\n\u201cdistinct experiences\u201d in different\n\u201csuperslices\u201d. He uses \u201cweight of a\nsuperslice\u201d instead of \u201cmeasure of existence\u201d and argues that it\nis intelligible to associate probabilities according to the\nProbability Postulate. Exploiting a variety of ideas in decoherence\ntheory such as the relational theory of tense and theories of identity\nover time, Saunders 1998 argues for the \u201cidentification of\nprobability with the Hilbert Space norm\u201d (which equals the\nmeasure of existence). Page 2003 promotes an approach named\nMindless Sensationalism. The basic concept in this approach\nis a conscious experience. He assigns weights to different\nexperiences depending on the quantum state of the universe, as the\nexpectation values of presently-unknown positive operators\ncorresponding to the experiences (similar to the measures of existence\nof the corresponding worlds). Page writes \u201c\u2026\nexperiences with greater weights exist in some sense more\n\u2026\u201d (2003, 479). In all of these approaches, the postulate is\nintroduced through an analogy with treatments of time, e.g., the\nmeasure of existence of a world is analogous to the duration of a\ntime interval. Note also Greaves 2004 who advocates the\n\u201cBehavior Principle\u201d on the basis of the\ndecision-theoretic reflection principle related to the next\nsection.\n4.3 Probability Postulate from Symmetry Arguments\n\nIn an ambitious work Deutsch 1999 claimed to derive the Probability\nPostulate from the quantum formalism and classical decision theory. In\nDeutsch\u2019s argument the notion of probability is operationalised\nby being reduced to an agent\u2019s betting preferences. So an agent\nwho is indifferent between receiving $20 on those branches where spin\n\u201cup\u201d is observed and receiving $10 on all branches by\ndefinition is deemed to give probability 1/2 to the spin-up\nbranches. Deutsch then attempts, using some symmetry arguments, to\nprove that the only rationally coherent strategy for an agent is to\nassign these operationalised \u201cprobabilities\u201d to equal the\nquantum-mechanical branch weights. Wallace 2003, 2007, 2010b, 2012\ndeveloped this approach by making explicit the tacit assumptions in\nDeutsch\u2019s argument. In the most recent version of these proofs,\nthe central assumptions are (i) the symmetry structure of unitary\nquantum mechanics; (ii) that an agent\u2019s preferences are\nconsistent across time; (iii) that an agent is indifferent to the\nfine-grained branching structure of the world per se. Early criticisms\nof the Deutsch-Wallace approach focussed on circularity concerns\n(Barnum et al. 2000, Baker 2007, Hemmo and Pitowsky 2007). As\nthe program led to more explicit proofs, criticism turned to the\ndecision-theoretic assumptions being made Lewis 2010, Albert 2010,\nKent 2010, Price 2010). The analysis of the Deutsch-Wallace program\ncontinues in a flurry of (mostly critical) papers Adlam 2014, Dawid\nand Th\u00e9bault 2014, Dawid and Th\u00e9bault 2015,\nDizadji-Bahmani 2015, Jansson 2016, Read 2018, Mandolesi 2018,\nMandolesi 2019, Araujo 2019, Brown and Ben Porath 2020, Saunders\nforthcoming-b.\n\nZurek 2005 offers a new twist to the Born rule derivation based on the\npermutation symmetry of states corresponding to worlds with equal\nmeasures of existence. He considered entangled systems and relies on\n\u201cenvariance\u201d symmetry: a unitary evolution of a system\nwhich can be undone by the unitary evolution of the system it is\nentangled with. Zurek assumes that a manipulation of the second system\ndoes not change the probability of the measurement on the first\nsystem. The swap of the states of the system swaps the probabilities\nof the outcomes, because the outcomes are correlated with the other\nsystems, where nothing has been changed. Since the swaps of the two\nsystems lead to the original state, the probabilities should be\nunchanged, but they have swapped, so they must be equal.\n\nSebens and Carroll 2018 provided a proof of the Probability Postulate\nbased on symmetry considerations in the framework of the self-location\nuncertainty of Vaidman 1998. However Kent 2015 and McQueen and Vaidman\n2019 argued that their proof fails because it starts with a\nmeaningless question. The proof considers a situation as in a sleeping\npill experiment presented above: I was asleep during a quantum\nmeasurement, but unlike the original proposal, there was not any change\nin my state. I was not moved to different rooms according to the\nresults of the experiment. Still, the question is asked: What is the\nprobability for me to be in a world with a particular outcome? Whether\nthat question can be meaningfully asked depends on whether I have\nbranched. The critics argue that, although there are separate worlds,\nI have not yet branched and thus the question is not meaningful (at\nthis stage, I am in both worlds). The Sebens and Carroll proof might\nget off the ground if the program of diverging worlds Saunders 2010,\nforthcoming-b succeeds. Note also that Dawid and Friederich 2020 criticise\nSebens and Carroll 2018 on other grounds.\n\nVaidman 2012 uses symmetry to derive the Probability Postulate in\nanother way. He starts from a situation which is symmetric in all\nrelevant respects, so all outcomes must have equal probability. To\nderive the postulate, he assumes relativistic causality which tells us\nthat the probability of an outcome of a measurement in one location\ncannot be affected by spatially remote manipulations, see McQueen and\nVaidman 2019. Vaidman 2020 stresses, however, that relativistic\ncausality of the evolution of the wave function of the Universe is not\nenough. In addition, we have to postulate the relativistic causality\nof the subjective experience of an observer within his world.\n5. Tests of the MWI\n\nIt has frequently been claimed, e.g. by De Witt 1970, that the MWI is\nin principle indistinguishable from the ideal collapse theory. This is\nnot so. The collapse leads to effects that do not exist if the MWI is\nthe correct theory. To observe the collapse we would need a super\ntechnology which allows for the \u201cundoing\u201d of a quantum\nexperiment, including a reversal of the detection process by\nmacroscopic devices. See Lockwood 1989 (p. 223), Vaidman 1998 (p.\n257), and other proposals in Deutsch 1986. These proposals are all for\ngedanken experiments that cannot be performed with current or any\nforeseeable future technology. Indeed, in these experiments an\ninterference of different worlds has to be observed. Worlds are\ndifferent when at least one macroscopic object is in macroscopically\ndistinguishable states. Thus, what is needed is an interference\nexperiment with a macroscopic body. Today there are interference\nexperiments with larger and larger objects (e.g., molecules with 2000\natoms, see Fein et al. 2019), but these objects are still not\nlarge enough to be considered \u201cmacroscopic\u201d. Such\nexperiments can only refine the constraints on the boundary where the\ncollapse might take place. A decisive experiment should involve the\ninterference of states which differ in a macroscopic number of degrees\nof freedom: an impossible task for today\u2019s technology. It can be\nargued, see for example Parrochia 2020, that the burden of an\nexperimental proof lies with the opponents of the MWI, because it is\nthey who claim that there is a new physics beyond the well-tested\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. As the analysis of Schlosshauer 2006 shows,\nwe have no such evidence.\n\nThe MWI is wrong if there is a physical process of collapse of the\nwave function of the Universe to a single-world quantum state. Some\ningenious proposals for such a process have been made (see Pearle 1986\nand the entry on\n collapse theories).\n These proposals (and Weissman\u2019s 1999 non-linear decoherence\nidea) have additional observable effects, such as a tiny energy\nnon-conservation, that were tested in several experiments, e.g.\nCollett et al. 1995, Diosi 2015. The effects were not found\nand some (but not all!) of these models have been ruled out, see\nVinante et al. 2020.\n\nMuch of the experimental evidence for quantum mechanics is statistical\nin nature. Greaves and Myrvold 2010 argued that our experimental data\nfrom quantum experiments supports the Probability Postulate of the MWI\nno less than it supports the Born rule in other approaches to quantum\nmechanics (see, however, Kent 2010, Albert 2010, and Price 2010 for\nsome criticisms). Barrett and Huttegger 2020 argue that \u201ceven an\nideal observer under ideal epistemic conditions may never have any\nempirical evidence whatsoever for believing that the results of\none\u2019s quantum-mechanical experiments are randomly\ndetermined\u201d. Thus, statistical analysis of quantum experiments\nshould not help us testing the MWI, but we might mention speculative\ncosmological arguments in support of the MWI by Page 1999, Kragh 2009,\nAguirre and Tegmark 2011, and Tipler 2012.\n6. Objections to the MWI\n\nSome of the objections to the MWI follow from misinterpretations due\nto the multitude of various MWIs. The terminology of the MWI can be\nconfusing: \u201cworld\u201d is \u201cuniverse\u201d in Deutsch\n1996, while \u201cuniverse\u201d is \u201cmultiverse\u201d. There\nare two very different approaches with the same name \u201cThe\nMany-Minds Interpretation (MMI)\u201d. The MMI of Albert and Loewer\n1988 mentioned above should not be confused with the MMI of Lockwood\net al. 1996 (which resembles the approach of Zeh 1981).\nFurther, the MWI in the Heisenberg representation, Deutsch 2002,\ndiffers significantly from the MWI presented in the Schr\u00f6dinger\nrepresentation (used here). The MWI presented here is very close to\nEverett\u2019s original proposal, but in the entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics,\n as well as in his book, Barrett 1999, uses the name \u201cMWI\u201d\nfor the splitting worlds view publicized by De Witt 1970. This\napproach has been justly criticized: it has both some kind of collapse\n(an irreversible splitting of worlds in a preferred basis) and the\nmultitude of worlds. Now we consider some objections in detail.\n6.1 Ockham\u2019s Razor\n\nIt seems that the preponderance of opposition to the MWI comes from\nthe introduction of a very large number of worlds that we do not see:\nthis looks like an extreme violation of Ockham\u2019s principle:\n\u201cEntities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity\u201d.\nHowever, in judging physical theories one could reasonably argue that\none should not multiply physical laws beyond necessity either (such a\nversion of Ockham\u2019s Razor has been applied in the past), and in\nthis respect the MWI is the most economical theory. Indeed, it has all\nthe laws of the standard quantum theory, but without the collapse\npostulate, which is the most problematic of the physical laws. The MWI\nis also more economical than Bohmian mechanics, which has in addition\nthe ontology of the particle trajectories and the laws which give\ntheir evolution. Tipler 1986a (p. 208) has presented an effective\nanalogy with the criticism of Copernican theory on the grounds of\nOckham\u2019s razor.\n\nOne might also consider a possible philosophical advantage of the\nplurality of worlds in the MWI, similar to that claimed by realists\nabout possible worlds, such as Lewis 1986 (see the discussion of the\nanalogy between the MWI and Lewis\u2019s theory by Skyrms 1976 and\nWilson 2020). However, the analogy is not complete: Lewis\u2019\ntheory considers all logically possible worlds, far more than all the\nworlds that are incorporated in the quantum state of the Universe.\n6.2 The Problem of Preferred Basis\n\nA common criticism of the MWI stems from the fact that the formalism\nof quantum theory allows infinitely many ways to decompose the quantum\nstate of the Universe into a superposition of orthogonal states. The\nquestion arises: \u201cWhy choose the particular decomposition (2)\nand not any other?\u201d Since other decompositions might lead to a\nvery different picture, the whole construction seems to lack\npredictive power.\n\nThe locality of physical interactions defines the preferred basis. As\ndescribed in Section 3.5, only localized states of macroscopic objects\nare stable. And indeed, due to the extensive research on decoherence,\nthe problem of preferred basis is not considered as a serious\nobjection anymore, see Wallace 2010a. Singling out position as a\npreferred variable for solving the preferred basis problem might be\nconsidered as a weakness, but on the other hand, it is implausible\nthat out of a mathematical theory of vectors in Hilbert space one can\nderive what our world should be. We have to add some ingredients to\nour theory and adding locality, the property of all known physical\ninteractions, seems to be very natural (in fact, it plays a crucial\nrole in all interpretations). Hemmo and Shenker 2020 also argued that\nsomething has to be added to the Hilbert space structure, but viewed\nthe addition of a locality of interaction postulate as the reason that\nOckham\u2019s razor does not cut in favour of the MWI. Note, that\ntaking position as a preferred variable is not an ontological claim\nhere, in contrast to the options discussed in the next section.\n6.3 The Wave Function is not Enough\n\nAs mentioned above, the gap between the mathematical formalism of the\nMWI, namely the wave function of the Universe, and our experience is\nlarger than in other interpretations. This is the reason why many\nthought that the ontology of the wave function is not enough. Bell\n1987 (p.201) felt that either the wave function is not everything, or\nit is not right. He was looking for a theory with local\n\u201cbeables\u201d. Many followed Bell in search of a\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d in 3+1 space-time, see Allori et\nal. 2014.\n\nA particular reason why the wave function of the Universe cannot be\nthe whole ontology lies in the argument, led by Maudlin 2010, that\nthis is the wrong type of object. The wave function of the Universe\n(considered to have N particles) is defined in 3N dimensional\nconfiguration space, while we need an entity in 3+1 space-time (like\nthe primitive ontology), see discussion by Albert 1996, Lewis 2004,\nMonton 2006, Ney 2021. Addition of \u201cprimitive ontology\u201d to\nthe wave function of the Universe helps us understand our experience,\nbut complicates the mathematical part of the theory. In the framework\nof the MWI, it is not necessary. The expectation values of the density\nof each particle in space-time, which is the concept derived from the\nwave functions corresponding to different worlds, can play the role of\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d. Since interactions between particles\nare local in space, this is what is needed for finding causal\nconnections ending at our experience. The density of particles is\ngauge independent and also properly transforms between different\nLorentz observers such that they all agree upon their experiences. In\nparticular, the explanation of our experience is unaffected by the\n\u201cnarratability failure\u201d problem of Albert 2013: the wave\nfunction description might be different for different Lorentz frames,\nbut the description in terms of densities of particles is the same.\nNote also an alternative approach based on 3+1 space-time by Wallace\nand Timpson 2010 who, being dissatisfied with the wave function\nontology, introduced the formulation of  Spacetime State\nRealism. Recently more works appeared on this subject: Ney and\nAlbert 2013, Myrvold 2015, Gao 2017, Lombardi et al. 2019,\nMaudlin 2019, Chen 2019, Carroll and Singh 2019. These works show\nsignificant difficulties in obtaining our world as emergent from the\nUniversal wave function. This explains the skeptical tone of\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics.\n But, as discussed in Sec.3, the success of the\n\u201cemergence\u201d program is not crucial: it is enough to find\nthe counterpart of the world we experience in the Universal wave\nfunction.\n6.4 Derivation of the Probability Postulate\n\nA popular criticism of the MWI in the past, see Belinfante 1975, which\nwas repeated by Putnam 2005, is based on the naive derivation of the\nprobability of an outcome of a quantum experiment as being\nproportional to the number of worlds with this outcome. Such a\nderivation leads to the wrong predictions, but accepting the idea of\nprobability being proportional to the measure of existence of a world\nresolves this problem. Although this involves adding a postulate, we\ndo not complicate the mathematical part (i) of the theory since we do\nnot change the ontology, namely, the wave function. It is a postulate\nbelonging to part (ii), the connection to our experience, and it is a\nvery natural postulate: differences in the mathematical descriptions\nof worlds are manifest in our experience, see Saunders 1998.\n\nAnother criticism related to probability follows from the claim,\napparently made by Everett himself and later by many other proponents\nof the MWI, see De Witt 1970, that the Probability Postulate can be\n derived  just from the formalism of the MWI. Unfortunately,\nthe criticism of this derivation (which might well be correct) is\nconsidered to be a criticism of the MWI, see Kent 1990. The recent\nrevival of this claim involving decision theory, Deutsch 1999, 2012,\nand some other symmetry arguments Zurek 2005, Sebens and Carroll 2018\nalso encountered strong criticisms (see Section 4.3) which might be\nperceived as criticisms of the MWI itself. Whereas the MWI may have no\nadvantage over other interpretations insofar as the derivation of the\nBorn rule is concerned, Papineau 2010 argues that it also has no\ndisadvantages.\n\nThe issue, named by Wallace 2003 as the \u201cincoherence\u201d\nprobability problem, is arguably the most serious difficulty. How can\none talk about probability when all possible outcomes happen? This led\nSaunders and Wallace 2008a to introduce uncertainty to the MWI, see\nrecent analysis in Saunders forthcoming-b. However, Section 4.2 shows how one\ncan explain the illusion of probability of an observer in a world,\nwhile the Universe incorporating all the worlds remains deterministic,\nsee also Vaidman 2014. Albert 2010, 2015 argue that Vaidman\u2019s\nprobability appears too late. Vaidman 2012 and McQueen and Vaidman\n2019 answer Albert by viewing the probability as the value of a\nrational bet on a particular result. The results of the betting of the\nexperimenter are relevant for his successors emerging in different\nworlds after performing the experiment. Since the experimenter is\nrelated to all of his successors and they all have identical rational\nstrategies for betting, then this should also be the strategy of the\nexperimenter before the experiment.\n6.5 Social Behavior of a Believer in the MWI\n\nThere are claims that a believer in the MWI will behave in an\nirrational way. One claim is based on the naive argument described in\nthe previous section: a believer who assigns equal probabilities to\nall different worlds will make equal bets for the outcomes of quantum\nexperiments that have unequal probabilities.\n\nAnother claim, Lewis 2000, is related to the strategy of a believer in\nthe MWI who is offered to play a quantum Russian roulette\ngame. The argument is that I, who would not accept an offer to play a\nclassical Russian roulette game, should agree to play the roulette any\nnumber of times if the triggering occurs according to the outcome of a\nquantum experiment. Indeed, at the end, there will be one world in\nwhich Lev is a multi-millionaire and in all other worlds there will be\nno Lev Vaidman alive. Thus, in the future, Lev will be a rich and\npresumably happy man.\n\nHowever, adopting the Probability Postulate leads all believers in the\nMWI to behave according to the Behavior Principle and with this\nprinciple our behavior is similar to the behavior of a believer in the\ncollapse theory who cares about possible future worlds according to\nthe probability of their occurrence. I should not agree to play\nquantum Russian roulette because the measure of existence of worlds\nwith Lev dead will be much larger than the measure of existence of the\nworlds with a rich and alive Lev. This approach also resolves the\npuzzle which Wilson 2017 raises concerning The Quantum Doomsday\nArgument.\n\nAlthough in most situations the Behavior Principle makes the MWI\nbeliever act in the usual way, there are some situations in which a\nbelief in the MWI might cause a change in behaviour. Assume that I am\nforced to play a game of Russian roulette and given a choice between\nclassical or quantum roulette. If my subjective preference is to\nensure the existence of Lev in the future, I should choose a quantum\nversion. However, if I am terribly afraid of dying, I should choose\nclassical roulette which gives me some chance not to die.\n\nAlbrecht and Phillips 2014 claim that even a toss of a regular coin\nsplits the world, so there is no need for a quantum splitter,\nsupporting a common view that the splitting of worlds happens very\noften. Surely, there are many splitting events: every Geiger counter\nor single-photon detector splits the world, but the frequency of\nsplitting outside a physics laboratory is a complicated physics\nquestion. Not every situation leads to a multitude of worlds: this\nwould contradict our ability to predict how our world will look in the\nnear future.\n7. Why the MWI?\n\nFor proponents of the MWI, the main reason for adopting it is that it\navoids the collapse of the quantum wave. (Other no-collapse theories\nare not better than MWI for various reasons, e.g., the nonlocality of\nBohmian mechanics, see Brown and Wallace 2005; and the disadvantage of\nall of them is that they have some additional structure, see Vaidman\n2014). The collapse postulate is a physical law that differs from all\nknown physics in two aspects: it is genuinely random and it involves\nsome kind of action at a distance. Note that action at a distance due\nto collapse is a controversial issue, see the discussion in Vaidman 2016b\nand Myrvold 2016. According to the collapse postulate the outcome of a\nquantum experiment is not determined by the initial conditions of the\nUniverse prior to the experiment: only the probabilities are governed\nby the initial state. There is no experimental evidence in favor of\ncollapse and against the MWI. We need not assume that Nature plays\ndice: science has stronger explanatory power. The MWI is a\ndeterministic theory for a physical Universe and it explains why a\nworld appears to be indeterministic for human observers.\n\nThe MWI does not have action at a distance. The most celebrated\nexample of nonlocality of quantum mechanics given by\n Bell\u2019s theorem\n in the context of the\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument\n cannot get off the ground in the framework of the MWI because it\nrequires a single outcome of a quantum experiment, see the discussion in\nBacciagaluppi 2002, Brown and Timpson 2016. Although the MWI removes\nthe most bothersome aspect of nonlocality, action at a distance, the\nother aspect of quantum nonlocality, the nonseparability of remote\nobjects manifested in entanglement, is still there. A\n\u201cworld\u201d is a nonlocal concept. This explains why we\nobserve nonlocal correlations in a particular world.\n\nDeutsch 2012 claims to provide an alternative vindication of quantum\nlocality using a quantum information framework. This approach started\nwith Deutsch and Hayden 2000 analyzing the flow of quantum information\nusing the Heisenberg picture. After discussions by Rubin 2001 and\nDeutsch 2002, Hewitt-Horsman and Vedral 2007 analyzed the uniqueness\nof the physical picture of the information flow. Timpson 2005 and\nWallace and Timpson 2007 questioned the locality demonstration in this\napproach and the meaning of the locality claim was clarified in\nDeutsch 2012. Rubin 2011 suggested that this approach might provide a\nsimpler route toward generalization of the MWI of quantum mechanics to\nthe MWI of field theory. Recent works Raymond-Robichaud 2020, Kuypers\nand Deutsch 2021, B\u00e9dard 2021a, clarified the meaning of the\nDeutsch and Hayden proposal as an alternative local MWI which not only\nlacks action at a distance, but provides a set of local descriptions\nwhich completely describes the whole physical Universe. However, there\nis a complexity price. B\u00e9dard 2021b argues that  \u201cthe\ndescriptor of a single qubit has larger dimensionality than the\nSchr\u00f6dinger state of the whole network or of the\nUniverse!\u201d\n\nThe MWI resolves most, if not all, paradoxes of quantum mechanics\n(e.g., Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat), see Vaidman 1994, McQueen and Vaidman\n2020. A physical paradox is a phenomenon contradicting our intuition.\nThe laws of physics govern the Universe incorporating all the worlds\nand this is why, when we limit ourselves to a single world, we may run\ninto a paradox. An example is getting information about a region from\nwhere no particle ever came using the interaction-free\nmeasurement of Elitzur and Vaidman 1993. Indeed, on the scale of\nthe Universe there is no paradox: in other worlds particles were in\nthat region.\n\nVaidman 2001 finds it advantageous to think about all worlds together\neven in analysing a controversial issue of classical probability\ntheory, the\n Sleeping Beauty problem.\n Accepting the Probability Postulate reduces the analysis of\nprobability to a calculation of the measures of existence of various\nworlds. Note, however, that the Quantum Sleeping Beauty problem also\nbecame a topic of a hot controversy: Lewis 2007, Papineau and\nDur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0 2009, Groisman et al. 2013, Bradley\n2011, Wilson 2014, Schwarz 2015.\n\nStrong proponents of the MWI can be found among cosmologists, e.g.,\nTipler 1986b, Aguirre and Tegmark 2011. In quantum cosmology the MWI\nallows for discussion of the whole Universe, thereby avoiding the\ndifficulty of the standard interpretation which requires an external\nobserver, see Susskind 2016 for more analysis of the connections\nbetween the MWI and cosmology. Bousso and Susskind 2012 argued that\neven considerations in the framework of string theory lead to the\nMWI.\n\nAnother community where many favor the MWI is that of the researchers\nin quantum information. In quantum computing, the key issue is the\nparallel processing performed on the same computer; this is very\nsimilar to the basic picture of the MWI. Recently the usefulness of\nthe MWI for explaining the speedup of quantum computation has been\nquestioned: Steane 2003, Duwell 2007, Cuffaro 2012, forthcoming. It is not\nthat the quantum computation cannot be understood without the\nframework of the MWI; rather, it is just easier to think about quantum\nalgorithms as parallel computations performed in parallel worlds,\nDeutsch and Jozsa 1992. There is no way to use all the information\nobtained in all parallel computations \u2014 the quantum computer\nalgorithm is a method in which the outcomes of all calculations\ninterfere, yielding the desired result. The cluster-state quantum\ncomputer also performs parallel computations, although it is harder to\nsee how we get the final result. The criticism follows from\nidentifying the computational worlds with decoherent worlds. A quantum\ncomputing process has no decoherence and the preferred basis is chosen\nto be the computational basis.\n\nRecent studies suggest that some of the fathers of quantum mechanics\nheld views close to the MWI: Allori et al. 2011 say this\nabout Schr\u00f6dinger, and Becker 2004 about von Neumann. At the\nbirth of the MWI Wheeler 1957 wrote: \u201cNo escape seems possible\nfrom this relative state formulation if one wants to have a complete\nmathematical model for the quantum mechanics \u2026\u201d Since then,\nthe MWI struggled against the\n Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n see Byrne 2010, Barrett and Byrne 2012, gaining legitimacy in recent\nyears Deutsch 1996, Bevers 2011, Barrett 2011, Tegmark 2014, Susskind\n2016, Zurek 2018 and Brown 2020 in spite of the very diverse opinions\nin the talks of its 50th anniversary celebration: Oxford 2007,\nPerimeter 2007, Saunders et al. 2010.\n\nBerenstain 2020 argues that the MWI is the latest example of\nsuccessive scientific revolutions which forced humans to abandon the\nprejudice that they occupy a privileged position at the center of the\nUniverse. The heliocentric model of the Solar System, Darwinian\nevolution and the Special Theory of Relativity follow this pattern. The\nMWI offers metaphysical neutrality between the perspectives of\nobservers on different branches of the Universal wave function, as\nopposed to single-world theories which give a privileged perspective\non reality to one observer.\n",
