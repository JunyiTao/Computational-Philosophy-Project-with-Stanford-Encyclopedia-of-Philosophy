    "main_text": "Applications\n6. Applications\n\nIn modern moral philosophy, duties to oneself are often treated as an\nisolated, antiquated topic. Paul Schofield (2021, 6) remarks that\n\u201cself-directed duties find themselves largely absent from the\ncontemporary philosophical scene,\u201d as attested by the fact that\n\u2013 as of the time of his writing \u2013 there was \u201cno\nstandalone entry for duties to self\u201d in the Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nAs readers of this entry will note, such lacunas in the literature are\nfilling up fast. More and more links are being uncovered between\nduties to self and far-flung moral questions \u2013 how we should use\nour smartphones (Aylsworth and Castro 2021); whether to let companies\nmine our data (Allen 2013); whether we should \u201csuck it up\u201d\nin the face of injustice or instead go out and protest (Boxill 1976;\nHill, Jr 1991d; Straumanis 1984).\n\nHere we will survey some particularly interesting issues that\nintersect with obligations to oneself.\n",
