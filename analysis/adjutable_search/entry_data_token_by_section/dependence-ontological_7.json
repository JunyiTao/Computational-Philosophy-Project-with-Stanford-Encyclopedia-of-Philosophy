    "main_text": "Essential Dependence and Identity-Dependence || Essential Dependence\n4.3 Essential Dependence\n\nHaving defined identity-dependence by\n (ID)\n as a species of essential dependence, we are now in a\nposition to identify other species of essential dependence, the most\nobvious being what may aptly be called essential\n(existential) dependence, which can be defined as\nfollows:\n\n(EDE)\n x dependsE for its existence upon y\n=df It is part of the essence of x that x\nexists only if y exists.\n\n\nNote that, whereas\u2014assuming the truth of\n (ID-NEX)\u2014two\n distinct entities cannot be identity-dependent upon each\nother, it very plausibly is possible for each of two\ndistinct entities to dependE for its existence on\nthe other. For example, consider a solid sphere. Let us assume for the\npurposes of this example that the solid sphere is a\nsubstance, a kind of basic, ontologically\nindependent entity (see\n \u00a76.3\n for further discussion). If we think of the top and bottom\n\u201chalves\u201d of a solid sphere as being geometrically\ndefined entities whose boundaries are specified by reference to the\nwhole sphere of which they are equal subdivisions, then it could be\nargued that it is part of the essence of each such hemisphere that it\nexists only if the other does. (These \u201chalves\u201d, it should\nbe emphasized, must not be confused with the portions of matter\n\u201cfilling\u201d them at any given time, and hence should not be\nthought of as \u201cparts\u201d of the sphere of which it is\nmaterially composed.) At the same time, each hemisphere\ndepends for its identity upon the whole sphere\u2014one\nbeing identified as the top half of that sphere and the other as the\nbottom half\u2014whereas the sphere itself does not likewise depend\nfor its identity upon either of these halves, given that we have\nassumed that it is a substance in its own right. This example is\nadmittedly controversial: one could insist that the constitutive\nessence for each hemisphere involves the whole sphere, but not the\nother hemisphere. Moreover, one could also focus on the\nplural or collective essence of the halves, which\nmight help us get around this circularity (on plural/collective\nessence, see Zylstra 2019). Note also that, very plausibly, if\nx dependsE for its existence upon y, then\nx also dependsR for its existence upon y:\nessential existential dependence entails rigid\nexistential dependence\u2014but not, of course, vice\nversa.\n\nWe have seen that (ID) and (EDE) correspond to rigid forms of\nmodal-existential dependence, such as (EDR). But we can also formulate\na generic notion of essential dependence, just like we did in\nthe case of modal-existential dependence. Corresponding to generic\nexistential dependence (EDG), we can formulate generic essential\n(existential) dependence as follows:\n\n(EDEG) \nx dependsEG for its existence upon Fs\n=df It is part of the essence of x that x\nexists only if some F exists.\n\n\nFor instance, if x is a particular water molecule, we may say\nthat it is a part of the essence of that water molecule that it exists\nonly if some atoms of hydrogen and oxygen exist. In other words, water\nmolecules essentially depend for their existence on there being atoms\nof the kind hydrogen and oxygen. It may be helpful to introduce a\ndistinction between individual and general essences\nin this connection. (EDEG) as applied to the case of water certainly\napplies to each and every water molecule rather than just one of them.\nAccordingly, when we speak of the essence of water in this context, we\nare not referring to the individual essence of any particular water\nmolecule, but to the general essence of the natural kind\nwater. (EDEG) concerns what an entity depends upon for its\ngeneral essence (e.g., what makes something count as a water\nmolecule), whereas (EDE) concerns what an entity depends upon for its\nindividual essence (e.g., what makes something the particular water\nmolecule it is, as opposed to any other). (For further discussion of\nthis distinction between individual and general essence, see Lowe\n2008.)\n\nWe can find slightly different formulations of essential dependence in\nthe literature. For instance, on Kathrin Koslicki\u2019s (2012: 190)\nre-construal of Fine\u2019s essentialist account, we get:\n\n(EDC)\n An entity x ontologically depends on an entity (or\nentities), y, just in case y is a constituent (or are\nconstituents) in x\u2019s essence.\n\n\nThis account relies on the notion of constitutive essence,\nwhich is developed in Fine\u2019s work (1994b, 1995). We have already\ndefined this notion above, but a recap may be useful. As Fine puts\nit:\n\n\nwe may take x to depend upon y if y is a\nconstituent of a proposition that is true in virtue of the identity of\nx or, alternatively, if y is a constituent of an\nessential property of x. (Fine 1994b: 275)\n\n\nIt should also be noted that even though the notions of essential\ndependence defined above are no doubt more fine-grained than the\nmodal-existential notions, there may be reasons to think that even\nthey are not sufficiently fine-grained for all purposes (as argued in\nKoslicki 2012). To illustrate, consider Fine\u2019s well-known\ndiscussion of Socrates and the singleton set that has Socrates as its\nsole member. To use Fine\u2019s terminology, we could say that it is\npart of the constitutive essence of Socrates\u2019s singleton set\nthat it has Socrates as its sole member, whereas it is not\npart of the constitutive essence of Socrates to be the sole member of\nSocrates\u2019s singleton set. But as Koslicki (2012: 195) points\nout, this is really just to say that Socrates\u2019s singleton set\nontologically depends on Socrates whereas Socrates does not\nontologically depend on Socrates\u2019s singleton set. The relevant\nnotion of dependence appears to be built into Fine\u2019s notion of\nessence and, similarly, the notion of essence assumed by Fine (and\nmany other \u201cneo-Aristotelians\u201d) is already built into\n(EDC).\n\nBefore we conclude our discussion of essential dependence, a major\nissue in the literature concerning ontological dependence should be\nmentioned. For it appears that those who are willing to buy into a\nsuitably fine-grained notion of essence, popular in the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d tradition, will find the\nmodal-existential account of ontological dependence far too\ncoarse-grained. Yet, those who are not sympathetic to the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d notion of essence but would rather\nanalyze essence in terms of modality would insist that the\nmodal-existential analysis is quite sufficient, and indeed that\nessential dependence collapses into modal-existential dependence. The\nrecent literature has perhaps been dominated by the\n\u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d line (although one does not, of course,\nneed to be \u201cneo-Aristotelian\u201d to accept the notion of\nessential dependence or the \u201cnon-modalist\u201d analysis of\nessence), but this is indeed only a relatively recent phenomenon. A\nfurther issue is that there is some disagreement about how the\nrelevant notion of essence is to be constrained amongst those who\nthink that a more fine-grained analysis than the modal-existential\naccount is needed. For instance, Koslicki (2012: 196 ff.) regards\nFine\u2019s propositional notion of essence according to which there\nis little or no distinction between essence and real\ndefinition as overly restrictive. She identifies the source of\nthis restrictive conception of essence, which is also present in\nLowe\u2019s work, to be the focus on essences as\nindividuating\u2014this is the type of view regarding essential\ndependence, namely identity-dependence, which we have here been\nfocusing on. On Koslicki\u2019s alternative picture, essences\n\n\nmust do more than individuate the entities whose essences they are;\nand real definitions must do more than state conditions which uniquely\nidentify and delineate the entities under consideration at every time\nand in every world in which they exist.
