    "main_text": "The Three Editions of the Principia\n3. The Three Editions of the Principia[13]\n\n\nNewton originally planned a two-book work, with the first book\nconsisting of propositions mathematically derived from the laws of\nmotion, including a handful concerning motion under resistance forces,\nand the second book, written and even formatted in the manner of\nDescartes's Principia, applying these propositions to lay out\nthe system of the world. By the middle of 1686 Newton had\nswitched to a three-book structure, with the second book devoted to\nmotion in resisting media. What appears to have convinced him\nthat this topic required a separate book was the promise of\npendulum-decay experiments to allow him to measure the variation of\nresistance forces with\n velocity.[14]\nWhen Hooke raised a priority issue on\ninverse-square forces, Newton dropped the original version of the last\nbook, switching to presenting the system of the world in a sequence of\nmathematically argued propositions, many of which demand far more of\nthe reader than anything in the original version. The original\n\u201cSystem of the World\u201d did appear in print the year after Newton died.\nNo complete text for the original version of Book 1 has ever been\nfound.\n\n\nNewton was disappointed in the critical response to the first\nedition. The response in England was adulatory, but the failure\nto note loose ends must have led Newton to doubt how much anyone had\nmastered technical details. The leading scientific figure on the\nContinent, Christiaan Huygens, offered a mixed response to the book in\nhis Discourse on the Cause of Gravity (1690). On the one\nhand, he was convinced by Newton's argument that inverse-square\nterrestrial gravity not only extends to the Moon, but is one in kind\nwith the centripetal force holding the planets in orbit; on the other\nhand,\n\n\nI am not especially in agreement with a Principle that he supposes in\nthis calculation and others, namely, that all the small parts that we\ncan imagine in two or more different bodies attract one another or\ntend to approach each other mutually. This I could not concede,\nbecause I believe I see clearly that the cause of such an attraction\nis not explicable either by any principle of Mechanics or by the\nlaws of motion. Nor am I at all persuaded of the necessity of the\nmutual attraction of whole bodies, having shown that, were there no\nEarth, bodies would not cease to tend toward a center because of what\nwe call their gravity. [HD, p.159]\n\n\nOthers on the Continent pressed this complaint even more\nforcefully. The response that may well have bothered Newton most\nwas the review in Journal des S\u00e7avants:\n\n\n\nThe work of M. Newton is a mechanics, the most perfect that one could\nimagine, as it is not possible to make demonstrations more precise or\nmore exact than those he gives in the first two books\u2026. But one\nhas to confess that one cannot regard these demonstrations otherwise\nthan as only mechanical; indeed the author recognizes himself at the\nend of page four and the beginning of page five that he has not\nconsidered their Principles as a Physicist, but as a mere\nGeometer\u2026.\n\n \nIn order to make an opus as perfect as\npossible, M. Newton has only to give us a Physics as exact as his\nMechanics. He will give it when he substitutes true motions for\nthose that he has\n supposed.[15]\n\n\n\nComplicating the matter further was the publication in 1689 of\nLeibniz's \u201cEssay on the causes of celestial motions,\u201d which offered a\nvortex theory in which \u201ca planet moves with a double motion\ncomposed of the harmonic circulation of its fluid deferent orb, and the\nparacentric motion, as if it had a certain gravity of attraction,\nnamely an impulsion towards the Sun\u201d [L,\n 132].[16]\nLeibniz further concluded that when the body \u201cis carried in an\nellipse (or another conic section) with a harmonic\ncirculation, and the centre both of attraction and of circulation is at\nthe focus of the ellipse, then the attractions or solicitations of\ngravity will be directly as the squares of the circulations, or\ninversely as the squares of the radii or distances from the focus\u201d\n[L, 137]. So, within a year and a half of the\npublication of the Principia a competing vortex theory of\nKeplerian motion had appeared that was consistent with Newton's\nconclusion that the centripetal forces in Keplerian motion are\ninverse-square. This gave Newton reason to sharpen the argument\nin the Principia against vortices.\n\n\nThe second edition appeared in 1713, twenty six years after the\nfirst. It had five substantive changes of note. First, the\nstructure of the argument for universal gravity at the beginning of\nBook 3 was made more evident, and the word \u2018hypothesis\u2019 was dropped\nfrom it. Second, because of disappointment with pendulum-decay\nexperiments and an erroneous claim about the rate a liquid flows\nvertically through a hole in the bottom of a container, the second half\nof Section 7 of Book 2 was entirely replaced, ending with new\nvertical-fall experiments to measure resistance forces versus velocity\nand a forcefully stated rejection of all vortex\n theories.[17]\nThird,\nthe treatment of the variation of surface gravity with latitude (Book\n3, Proposition 20) was significantly extended, partly in response to\nHuygens's alternative treatment of this variation, but also because of\nmore recent data from near the Equator. Fourth, the treatment of\nthe wobble of the Earth producing the precession of the equinoxes was\nrevised in order to accommodate a much reduced gravitational force of\nthe Moon on the Earth than in the first edition. Fifth, several\nfurther examples of comets were added at the end of Book 3, taking\nadvantage of Halley's efforts on the topic during the intervening\nyears. In addition to these, two changes were made that were more\npolemical than substantive: Newton added the General Scholium following\nBook 3 in the second edition, and his editor Roger Cotes provided a\nlong anti-Cartesian (and anti-Leibnizian) Preface.\n\n\nThe third edition appeared in 1726, thirty nine years after the\nfirst. Most changes in it involved either refinements or new\ndata. The most significant revision of substance was to the\nvariation of surface gravity with latitude, where Newton now concluded\nthat the data showed that the Earth has a uniform density.\nSubsequent editions and translations have been based on the third\nedition. Of particular note is the edition published by two\nJesuits, Le Seur and Jacquier, in 1739-42, for it contains\nproposition-by-proposition commentary, much of it employing the\nLeibnizian calculus, that extends to roughly the same length as\nNewton's text.\n",
