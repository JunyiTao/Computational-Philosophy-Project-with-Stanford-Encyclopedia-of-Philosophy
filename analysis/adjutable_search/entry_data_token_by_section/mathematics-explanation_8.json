    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in mathematics || Models of mathematical explanation\n3. Some connections to other debates\n\nA number of fruitful studies have recently appeared connecting\nmathematical explanation to mathematical beauty, purity of methods,\nunderstanding in mathematics, mathematical style, and mathematical\ndepth. We simply refer to one or two such background studies and\nencourage the reader to explore the bibliography of the studies\nreferred to. The most extensive studies connecting mathematical beauty\nand explanation are Giaquinto (2016) and Lange (2016). The notion of\npurity of method has long been of interest to mathematicians and\nphilosophers (see Detlefsen and Arana (2011) and Arana and Mancosu\n(2012)). Among the most recent contributions on purity and\nmathematical explanation are Skow (2015), Lange (2015b), Ryan (2021)\nand Arana (2023). The connection between mathematical explanation and\nunderstanding has been discussed in Molinini (2011), Cellucci (2014),\nand Delarivi\u00e9re et al. (2017). For connections between\nmathematical depth and mathematical explanation see Lange (2015c).\nMoreover, theorists of style in mathematics and science have\nemphasized the importance of explanatory arguments for characterizing\nstyle (see Mancosu (2021) for an overview).\n\nThe issues that have shaped the debates about mathematical explanation\nreviewed in sections 1 and 2 also arise in ongoing debates in the\nphilosophy of mind and moral theory. For the philosophy of mind, one\npuzzle is how appealing to mental properties can explain human actions\neven though a human is a physical entity. If non-mental, physical\nproperties are apt to explain any physical event or pattern of\nphysical events, then it seems that mental properties are dispensable\nor \u201cepiphenomenal\u201d. For moral theory, a series of\nquestions arise about how moral properties relate to the presumably\nnon-moral features of the physical world. In terms of explanation, it\nseems like there is no explanatory work for moral properties to do, at\nleast with respect to physical events. However, our ordinary practices\nfrequently appeal to these properties in putative explanations. So, as\nwith the philosophy of mind, it seems that we must either revise our\nexplanatory practices or else find a place for these properties in a\nmore comprehensive conception of reality.\n\nKim\u2019s exclusion argument is a prominent driver of these debates\nin the philosophy of mind (Kim 2005). Kim argues that the existence of\nmental properties requires that these properties provide some genuine\ncontribution to the explanation of physical events. However, Kim\nmaintains that mental properties are excluded from this contribution\nby the causal closure of the physical, i.e. every physical event has a\npurely physical explanation. One response to Kim is that the right\nconception of causal explanation makes space for mental properties to\nexplain (Shapiro & Sober 2007, Woodward 2021b). The\n\u201cexplanatory autonomy\u201d of the mental can thus be obtained\nin a way that parallels similar generalizations of causal explanation\nto allow for genuine mathematical explanations of physical phenomena\n(section 1.2). Pluralists about mathematical explanation can develop a\ndifferent response to exclusion arguments: if explanations come in\ndifferent kinds, then an explanation of one kind does not stand in the\nway of an explanation of another kind (Batterman 2021). Baker (2022)\nhas pursued a different kind of response that compares Dennett\u2019s\nintentional stance with a \u201cmathematical stance\u201d that\nenables mathematical explanations of physical phenomena.\n\nHarman and Street have advanced explanatory challenges to moral\nproperties that can be fruitfully compared to criticisms of the\nexplanatory indispensability argument for mathematical platonism\n(Harman 1977, Street 2006). While Harman focuses on the explanation of\nmoral observations (e.g. that some action is wrong), Street emphasizes\na broader concern with explaining other phenomena such as the\nprevalence of some moral judgments (e.g. that murder is wrong). For\nboth, the challenge is that the best explanation does not involve\nmoral properties. That is, moral properties are explanatorily\ndispensable for the targets in question. As Sinclair and Leibowitz\nemphasize, this argument, and the responses to it, parallel debates\nabout the explanatory dispensability of mathematical objects (Sinclair\n& Leibowitz 2016). One innovation in the debate about moral\nproperties is Enoch\u2019s argument that it is sufficient for moral\nproperties to be indispensable to practical deliberation. If this\nnon-Quinean condition for ontological commitment is granted, then it\nmay be feasible to identify new forms of explanatory indispensability\nfor mathematical objects. For some investigations into how such\narguments may or may not extend to mathematics, see Leng (2016), Baker\n(2016), Enoch (2016) and Clark-Doane (2020).\n",
