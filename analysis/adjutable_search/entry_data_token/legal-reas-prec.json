Precedent and analogy in legal reasoning\n\n\nArguments from precedent and analogy are characteristic of legal\nreasoning. Legal reasoning differs in a number of ways from the sort\nof reasoning employed by individuals in their everyday lives. It\nfrequently uses arguments that individuals do not employ, or that individuals\nemploy in different ways. Precedent is a good example of this. In\nindividual reasoning we do not normally regard the fact that we\ndecided one way in the past as raising some presumption that we should\ndecide the same way in the future. Of course there can be special\ncircumstances that have this effect\u2014someone may have relied on\nwhat we did before, or may have had their expectations raised that we\nwould do so again\u2014but absent these special\nconsiderations we do not regard ourselves as being committed in the\nfuture to make the same decision. It is always open to us to\nreconsider a decision and change our minds if we no longer think our\noriginal judgement was correct.\n\n\nLaw of course is not alone in attributing a special significance to\nprecedent. Many institutional and quasi-institutional practices place\nweight on what they have done previously in determining what they\nshould do now. Individuals, by contrast, will often disregard what\nthey did on an earlier occasion. If they do make reference to the\npast, this will normally be due to their belief that what they did in\nthe past was the right thing to do, or at least is a good guide to\nwhat is the right thing to do now. Normally, then, individuals will\nmerely be using their past decisions in the belief that they are a\nreliable short-cut to working out what is the right thing to do.  If\nthey harbour doubts as to the correctness of the earlier decision then\nthey will reopen the matter and consider it afresh on the merits. In\ninstitutional settings, on the other hand, decision-makers will often\nrefer to what has been decided in the past as constraining what should\nbe done now, regardless of whether they think the original decision\nwas correct.\n\n\nEqually, institutional decision-makers often regard earlier decisions\nas being relevant even when the decision at hand is different from the\noriginal ones, by citing them as analogies. They will argue that since\nan earlier decision was made on some matter, it would be inconsistent\nnow to decide the present case differently.  Individuals, by contrast,\nwill often simply attend to the merits of the particular question\nbefore them and try to get the decision right. If it is pointed out\nthat their current decision seems to be inconsistent with how they\ntreated an earlier question, this may prompt them to reconsider, but\nis not in itself a reason to change their decision. At the end of the\nday they may conclude that their earlier decision was a mistake, or\nthey may even embrace the apparent inconsistency, believing that both\nthe earlier and the later decisions are correct even though they are\nnot sure how they can be reconciled.\n\n\nLegal reasoning, then, gives a weight to what has been decided in the\npast that is usually absent from personal decision-making. We care\nabout whether we made the right decisions in the past, but we seek to\nmake the right decisions now, unconstrained by our earlier views.\n2. Precedent\n\n\nArguments from precedent are a prominent feature of legal\nreasoning. But what exactly is a \u2018precedent\u2019?  A precedent\nis the decision of a court (or other adjudicative body) that has a\nspecial legal significance. That significance lies in the\ncourt's decision being regarded as having practical,\nand not merely theoretical, authority over the content of the\nlaw. A decision has theoretical authority if the circumstances in\nwhich it was made (the identity of the decision-makers, those involved\nin arguing the case, the availability of evidence or time) provide\ngood reasons for believing the decision to be correct in law. If there\nare good reasons to believe that an earlier case was correctly\ndecided, and if the facts in a later case are the same as those in the\nearlier case, then there are good reasons for believing that the same\ndecision would be correct in the later case. In some legal systems\nearlier decisions are, officially, treated in just this way: cases are\ncited to courts, but courts may only justify their decisions by\nreference to other legal materials such as legislation. As a\nconsequence the decision in an earlier case is not in itself regarded\nas a justification for reaching a decision in a later\n case.[1]\n\n\nBy contrast, precedents have practical authority because they are\nregarded as partly constituting the law. Simplifying somewhat, the law\nis what the court stated it to be because the court stated it\nto be such. Putting the matter in these terms is over-simplified,\nhowever, because (a) it may be that what the court did,\nrather than what it said, that alters the law, and (b) there are\nnormally a number of limitations on the capacity of a decision to\nconstitute the law (depending upon the content of the decision and the\nstatus of the body making them). An important consequence of\nprecedents' practical authority is this: since courts are bound to apply the\nlaw, and since earlier decisions have practical authority over the\ncontent of the law (i.e., over what is the law), later courts\nare bound to follow the decisions of earlier cases. This is commonly\nknown as the doctrine of precedent, or stare decisis\n(i.e., standing by things decided).\n\n\nIt should be noted that the modern Common Law endorses a particularly\nstrong version of stare decisis, one that requires later\ncourts to follow earlier decisions even if those cases were\nwrongly decided according to the pre-existing law. It is often assumed\nby Common Lawyers that a doctrine of stare decisis\nnecessarily requires that later courts be bound by such erroneous\ndecisions. This follows from the following line of thought. If later\ncourts were not bound to follow erroneous decisions, then they would\nonly be \u2018bound\u2019 by earlier, correct judgments. But an\nearlier correct judgment simply reaches the conclusion that the law\nalready supported when it was delivered. So to direct courts to follow\ncases that were not erroneous would simply be to direct them to do\nwhat they are legally bound to do anyway (i.e., apply the law),\nthereby rendering the doctrine of precedent redundant. The flaw in\nthis argument lies in the assumption that in every case there must be\na single legally correct outcome, with other outcomes being\nwrong. This overlooks the possibility of cases in which the merits of\nthe dispute are legally indeterminate, so that there is more than one\npossible outcome that would not be wrong.  To say that a case is\n\u2018legally indeterminate\u2019 covers a range of situations, such\nas the merits of the opposing arguments being, in law, equal, or where\nthe conflicting considerations cannot be rationally ranked against\neach other. In cases such as these the decision alters the law without\nmaking any error. The Common Law, then, might have limited its\ndoctrine of stare decisis by holding that later courts were\nnot bound by earlier decisions that were wrongly\n decided.[2] \n Instead it developed a different practice\u2014that of\n\u2018overruling\u2019, whereby some courts were given a limited\npower to deprive earlier decisions of their binding status on the\nbasis that they were wrongly decided. So the Common Law's\nversion of the doctrine of precedent does not inevitably flow from the\nfact that precedents have practical authority. Nonetheless the idea of\nbeing bound to follow even erroneous decisions is a common feature of\nmany institutions decision-making, and will be the focus of this\nentry.\n\n\nThe precise operation of stare decisis varies from one legal\nsystem to another. It is common for courts lower in a judicial\nhierarchy to be strictly bound by the decisions of higher courts, so\nthat Federal Court judges in the United States are bound by decisions\nof the Federal Court of Appeals for their circuit, and the English\nCourt of Appeal is bound by decisions of the House of Lords. The lower\ncourt is \u2018strictly\u2019 bound because it has no power to\noverrule the higher court's decision.  Equally, most appeal\ncourts are bound by their own earlier decisions, though they are\ngenerally entitled in certain circumstances to overrule those\ndecisions. There is enormous variation in the circumstances that are\nnecessary for a court to overrule one of its own decisions: at a\nminimum it must regard the earlier decision as wrongly decided, but\ngenerally more is required than this, e.g. that the decision is\n\u2018clearly\u2019 or \u2018plainly\u2019\n wrong.[3].\n Finally, courts are generally not bound by the decisions of lower\ncourts: the House of Lords for example is not bound to follow\ndecisions of the Court of Appeal and is free to overrule such\ndecisions if it takes a different view of how the case should have\nbeen decided.\n\n\nThe most important limitation on the application of precedent is that\nthe decision in an earlier case is only binding in later cases where\nthe facts in the later case are the \u2018same\u2019 as those in the\nearlier case. It is agreed on all sides that if two cases are the same\nthen the precedent applies, whereas if they are different it does\nnot. What makes two cases the same, however, is a matter of\nconsiderable debate, and goes to the root of the question of the\nnature of precedent in legal reasoning. In saying that two cases are\nthe same, it cannot be that they are identical. It is obvious\nthat no two situations are identical in every respect: they must\ndiffer at least in having occurred at different times and/or different\nplaces. In practice the differences between any two cases will be much\nmore significant than this, and yet they may\u2014legally\nspeaking\u2014still be the same. For this reason, theorists often\nspeak of two cases being the same in \u2018all relevant\nrespects\u2019. Which of course simply raises the question of what\nmakes two cases \u2018relevantly\u2019 the same.\n\n\nThis problem is easier to understand if a number of distinct aspects\nof legal cases are taken into account. Most cases do not create\nprecedents: they turn on a dispute about the facts\u2014who did what,\nwhen, and to whom. In these cases the job of the court is to decide on\nthe evidence before it whose version of the facts to endorse. The\nparties in such cases agree about the law that applies to their\ndispute, they simply disagree about what actually happened. In other\ncases there can be a dispute over the applicable\nlaw\u2014one side claiming that on the facts the appropriate\nlaw supports a decision in their favour and the other side disputing\nthis account of the law and arguing that on those facts the law\nsupports a decision in favour of them. (It goes without saying that\nthere are also cases with disputes over both the facts and the law.)\nPrecedents are those cases which require the courts to resolve a\ndispute over the law.\n\n\nA precedent is the decision on the law in a\ncase before a court or some similar legal\ndecision-maker such as a tribunal. Paradigmatically in Common Law\nlegal systems a judicial decision is given in a\njudgment which has five aspects to it:\n\na recitation of the facts of the case, i.e., an\naccount of what\n happened[4];\nan identification of the legal issue\u2014the\ndisputed question of law\u2014which the court is being asked to\nresolve;\nthe reasoning over the appropriate resolution of\nthat issue;\nthe ruling resolving the issue put before the\ncourt, e.g. that in these circumstances the defendant has breached a\ncontract, or does not owe the plaintiff a duty of care, or holds the\nproperty on trust for a third party, or made a decision contrary to\nnatural justice; and\nthe result or outcome of the case, i.e., which\nparty succeeded in the action; which follows from (d).\n\n\n\n(For a more detailed discussion, see MacCormick 1987, 170ff.)  To take\nan example, the court may be faced with a case in which the trustee of\nproperty held on behalf of the plaintiff has wrongfully transferred\nthat property to the defendant. The plaintiff sues the defendant to\nrecover the property which was transferred in breach of trust.  The\nplaintiff argues that since (i) the defendant has received trust\nproperty (ii) in breach of trust and (iii) has not paid for the\nproperty, she should restore the property to the trust.  The defendant\nargues, on the other hand, that since (iv) the trustee had a good\ntitle to the property, (v) the power to transfer it and (vi) the\ndefendant acted in good faith, unaware of the breach of trust, she is\nentitled to retain it. The court will assess the situation and may\nrule that factors (i)\u2013(iii) do give the plaintiff a good action,\ni.e., that a recipient of trust property transferred in breach of\ntrust who has not paid for the property must restore it. In its\nreasoning the court will explain why the fact that the defendant\nreceived the property as a gift means that it should be\nrestored to the trust, despite the trustee having the legal power to\ntransfer the title.\n\n\nThe identification of the subset of factors (i)\u2013(iii) that\nconstitute the ruling is not always a straightforward task: this has\nto be determined from construing the judgment as a whole in the\ncontext of the area of law with which it deals. In particular it can\nbe difficult to ascertain the appropriate level of abstraction of the\ndescriptions of factors (i)\u2013(iii). A person is made ill by\ndrinking an opaque bottle of ginger beer containing a decomposing\n snail.[5] \n The manufacturer of the bottle is held to be liable to the person\nmade ill, despite the absence of any contract between her and the\nmanufacturer. What is the key characterisation of the vehicle of harm\non these facts?  The bottle of ginger beer is a beverage, but it\nis also a consumable, an article for human use and something capable\nof causing injury if negligently produced. (See further Stone 1985,\n125). Generally the judgment needs to be read as a whole to determine\nthe appropriate level: in particular the court's reasoning will\ntend to support one level of generality over another. In some cases,\nhowever, the level of generality will not be clear and it will not be\npossible to give a very precise account of the ruling. In other cases\nthe category may be incompletely characterised: there will be examples\nof items falling within the category but no general characterisation\nof it (see Levenbook 2000, 201\u201311).\n\n\nThis point brings out an important aspect of the study of\nprecedent. Lawyers are mostly preoccupied with two issues: (1)\nthe question of how to determine what a precedent is authority\nfor, e.g. how to characterise the ruling in the case\n(beverage? consumable?  article?), or how to deal with cases where\nthere is no single majority judgment in favour of the result, or how to\ntreat cases which give two alternative bases for the decision; and (2)\nthe question of when a court will be willing to overrule its own prior\ndecisions. The most interesting philosophical questions, however,\nconcern how precedents operate when, as is often the case, there is no\ndoubt about what the precedent is authority for, and the later court is\nnot free (or is unwilling) to overrule the earlier decision.\n\n\nThere are three ways in which it has been argued that precedents\nshould be\n understood:[6]\n (1) as laying down rules, (2) as the application of underlying\nprinciples, and (3) as a decision on the balance of reasons.\n2.1 Precedents as laying down rules\n\n\nOn the first approach precedents operate by laying down rules which\nlater courts are then bound to apply to the facts before them. \n(For versions of this view, see Raz 1979; MacCormick 1978 (especially\n82\u20136, 213\u201328) and 1987; Alexander 1989; and Schauer 1989,\n469\u201371 and 1991,\n 174\u201387.[7])\n In holding that (i)\u2013(iii) were the crucial facts for the\nresolution of the case, the court is creating a rule that whenever\ntrust property is transferred in breach of trust to a volunteer (i.e.,\none who does not pay for the property), the volunteer must restore the\nproperty to the beneficiary. The case decides a particular dispute,\nbut the court creates a rule to deal with that type of dispute and\napplies it to the case at hand. On this view, then, precedents are\nakin to statutes in that they lay down rules which apply to later\ncases whose facts satisfy the conditions for application.\n\n\nIn favour of this interpretation of precedent is the distinction drawn\nin legal practice between what is known as the \u2018ratio\ndecidendi\u2019 of a case and \u2018obiter\ndicta\u2019. The ratio of a case represents the\n\u2018holding\u2019 or \u2018ruling\u2019, i.e., the proposition\nof law for which the case is authority\u2014it is the aspect of the\ncase which is binding on later courts. Obiter dicta, by\ncontrast, represent other statements and views expressed in the\njudgment which are not binding on later courts. On this view of\nprecedent, the rule laid down in the earlier case is represented by\nthe ratio. \n\n\nThere are a range of criticisms of the rule-making account of\nprecedent which argue that it does not fit legal practice very well\n(see e.g. Moore 1987, 185\u20137). Two issues stand out: (i) the form\nin which judgments are presented, and (ii) the practice of\ndistinguishing.\n2.1.1 The form of judgments\n\n\nAlthough the idea of the ratio decidendi is a staple\nof legal practice, it is notable that it is a construct from\na precedent rather than an explicit feature of most legal\njudgments. Judgments are highly discursive texts and very rarely\nidentify their own rationes. What is more, even if a court\nchooses to explicitly formulate the ratio of its decision,\nthis precise formulation is not itself regarded as binding on\nlater courts. (See Perry 1987, 235\u20137; Schauer 1989, 455; Simpson\n1973, 372; Moore 1987, 185\u20136; Stone 1985, 123\u20139.)\n\n\nIt is often said that this creates a marked contrast with statutes,\nwhere a canonical formulation of the legal rule being laid down\nis provided. Given the flexibility open to later courts\nto determine the ratio of the earlier decision, it is\nmisleading to think that decisions lay down binding rules for later\ncourts. However, although there is a contrast with legislation\nhere, it can be exaggerated. In both situations the propositions\nof law for which a case or statutory provision is authority must be\nderived from the case or statute and is not identical with the\ntext of either. The real difference between precedent and statute\nlies in the fact that in the case of statutes legal systems have\nelaborate conventions of interpretation to assist in the process of\nderiving the law from a legislative text, whereas in the case of\nprecedents they do not. But this simply shows that the law\nderived from precedents may be vaguer and more indeterminate than that\nderived from (many) statutes; it does not establish that precedents do\nnot create legal rules.\n2.1.2 The practice of distinguishing\n\n\nAn integral part of legal reasoning using precedents is the practice\nof distinguishing. Distinguishing involves a precedent not\nbeing followed even though the facts of the later case fall within the\nscope of the ratio of the earlier case. As the later case\nfalls within the scope of the earlier ratio (i.e., within the\nscope of the rule), one might expect that the decision in the later\ncase must be the same (unless the court has the power to overrule the\nearlier case and decides to do so). In legal reasoning using\nprecedents, however, the later court is free not to follow the earlier\ncase by pointing to some difference in the facts between the two\ncases, even though those facts do not feature in the\nratio of the earlier case.\n\n\nTake the trust example: in a later case the recipient of trust\nproperty may not have paid for the property, but may have relied on\nthe receipt in entering into another arrangement (e.g. in using the\nproperty as security for a loan). The later court may hold that the\nrecipient is entitled to retain the property and justify its decision\nby ruling that where (i) the defendant has received trust property\n(ii) in breach of trust and (iii) has not paid for the property, but\nhas (vii) relied upon the receipt to disadvantageously alter her\nposition, then the defendant is entitled to retain the property.\n(This result would still leave the beneficiary with a claim against\nthe trustee for the value of the property.)\n\n\nThe effect of distinguishing, then, is that the later court is free\nnot to follow a precedent that, prima facie, applies to it,\nby making a ruling which is narrower than that made in the precedent\ncase. The only formal constraints on the later court are that: (1) in\nformulating the ratio of the later case, the factors in the\nratio of the earlier case (i.e., (i)\u2013(iii)) must be\nretained, and (2) the ruling in the later case must be such that it\nwould still support the result reached in the precedent\ncase. In short, the ruling in the second case must not be inconsistent\nwith the result in the precedent case, but the court is otherwise free\nto make a ruling narrower than that in the precedent. Hence the more\naccurate statements of the doctrine of precedent are to the effect\nthat a later court must either follow or distinguish\na binding precedent\u2014a disjunctive obligation.\n\n\nAt a formal level the practice of distinguishing can be reconciled\nwith the view that rationes are rules by arguing that later\ncourts have the power to modify the rule in the earlier\ncase. An analogy can be drawn to the power to overrule earlier\ndecisions: just as judges can overrule earlier cases, they\ncan also modify earlier law, thereby paralleling the power of\nlegislators to either repeal or amend the law. The analogy, however,\nis very imperfect. There are two difficulties: (a) Common Lawyers do\nnot conceptualise overruling and distinguishing in this parallel way,\nand (b) the rationale for a power with this particular scope is\nunclear.\n\n\nOn the first point, Common Lawyers ordinarily think of precedents as\nconstituting the law up and until they are overruled. Once overruled\nthe later decision is (normally) given retroactive effect, so the law\nis changed for the past as well as the future. But when a case is\ndistinguished it is not often thought that the law was one thing until\nthe later decision of a court, and now another thing.  The law will be\nregarded prior to the later decision as already subject to various\ndistinctions not mentioned by the earlier court.  Indeed part of the\nskill of a good common lawyer is grasping the law as not\nstated by the earlier court: learning that cases are\n\u2018distinguishable\u2019 is a staple part of common law\neducation, and no common lawyer would be competent who did not\nappreciate that the law was not to be identified simply with the\nratio of an earlier decision. Common lawyers do not, then,\nconceptualise distinguishing along lines analogous to overruling.\n\n\nOn the second point, one of the peculiarities of distinguishing is\nthat it cuts across the normal justifications for having rules, namely\nto have a class of cases treated in a certain way despite individual\nvariation between them, with attendant gains in predictability and\ntransparency in the decision-making process. Instead, the later court\nis free to avoid the result indicated by the earlier ratio so\nlong as it can find some difference in facts between the two cases\nthat narrows the earlier ratio while still supporting the\nresult in the earlier case. What is more, this power is not merely\ngiven to courts of the same level of authority as the one laying down\nthe precedent (as is the case with overruling), but is given to every\ncourt lower in the judicial hierarchy.  So the Court of\nAppeal in England cannot overrule a decision of the House of Lords\n(nor even its own decisions ordinarily), but it is free to distinguish\na decision of the House of Lords even when the case before it falls\nwithin the ratio of the House of Lords decision. So on the\nrule-making view of precedent lower courts have the power to narrow\nthe rules laid down by higher courts, just so long as the narrower\nrule would still support the result reached in the earlier case. It is\nunclear why lower courts should be given a power to narrow rulings of\nhigher courts in this particularly circumscribed manner.\n\n\nTwo ways in which distinguishing can be made less idiosyncratic are\nthese: (a) to argue that the later court is restricted to making a\nmodification which the earlier court would have made if confronted\nwith the current facts (cf. Raz 1979, 187\u20138), i.e., that\ndistinguishing is a form of reinterpretation of the original\nratio; or (b) to argue that there is a presumption\nagainst distinguishing (Schauer 1989, 469\u201371; 1991,\n174\u201387).  Each of these approaches echo forms of legal reasoning\nfound in statutory construction. The first, in asking what the earlier\ncourt would have done, assimilates the task of distinguishing to that\nof determining the law-maker's intent behind their ruling.  This\nis parallel to the practice of interpreting statutes in terms of\nlegislative intent. The alternative approach of there being a\npresumption against distinguishing parallels the creation of\nexceptions to statutory\n rules.[8]\n\n\nThe problem with these two suggestions is that the practice of\ndistinguishing does not conform to either of these constraints: while\ncourts do consider the earlier decision in order to see if\nthe ratio can be reinterpreted, they also introduce\ndistinctions without recourse to the earlier court's views; and\nthey do not typically approach the task of distinguishing as if there\nis a presumption against it. As a matter of legal practice, then,\nthere are no legal restrictions of this kind on the later court.\nDistinguishing, then, does not seem to fit easily with the\nunderstanding of rationes as creating binding legal\nrules. (See also Perry 1987, 237\u20139 on\ndistinguishing.)\n\n\nA third way which purports to deal with the problem of\ndistinguishing on the rule model is to argue that the\n\u2018rule\u2019 for which the decision is binding is not the\nprecedent court's ruling, but something narrower\u2014the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 that were \u2018necessary\u2019 for the\nresult of the case. (See Goodhart 1930, 1959; and see also Burton\n1995, 25\u201358, 60\u20135 on \u2018case-specific facts\u2019 and\nEisenberg 1988, 51\u20134 on \u2018minimalist\u2019 and\n\u2018result-centred\u2019 techniques.)  This approach makes use of\nthe fact that decisions do not provide canonical formulations of the\nratio to argue that the ratio is not to be\nidentified with the court's stated ruling on the\nissue. The effect of such an approach is to narrow what is regarded as\nbinding in the case to those facts which were crucial to the actual\noutcome, rather than the stated ruling applied to those facts. The\ndifficulties with this approach are three-fold:\n\n\n (1) it goes against general legal practice, which usually does\nidentify the ratio with the ruling made by the precedent\ncourt (see Simpson 1961, 168\u20139; MacCormick 1978, 82\u20133,\n1987, 157\u20138; Raz 1979, 184; Eisenberg 1988,\n 51\u201361)[9];\n\n\n(2) if the precedent court's own characterisation of its ruling\nis abandoned, there is no coherent way to settle on the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 (Stone 1964, 267\u201380, 1985,\n123\u20139). Take the case of the recipient of trust property\ntransferred in breach of trust. A key aspect of the facts is that the\nrecipient did not pay for the property. But why is this\n\u2018material\u2019?  If the court's own reasoning is put to\none side, is it because no consideration was given (so had a\ntoken been provided that would have been sufficient); or that\ninadequate consideration was provided (so more than a token\nwould be necessary); or that a reasonable price was not paid;\nor that the price was not what the beneficiary would have been willing\nto accept for the transfer; or that the price is not the best which\nthe trustee could have obtained on the open market?  All of the\npreceding descriptions of the facts are true, but which is\n\u2018material\u2019?  The requirement for any of them would\ninvalidate the transfer. \n\n\n(3) Even if there is some way to characterise the\n\u2018material\u2019 facts, it does not eliminate\ndistinguishing. Take later trust case, for example, in which the\nrecipient has paid nothing for the trust property but has\nacted detrimentally in reliance on the receipt. The recipient is still\na \u2018volunteer\u2019 who has not transferred anything to the\ntrustee for the property, but there has been reliance upon\nthe receipt. This may well lead a later court to distinguish the\nearlier case, although the facts are otherwise identical to those in\nthe original case. On the other hand, if the claim is that the\nprecedent case is only binding when both (a) the\n\u2018material facts\u2019 are present, and (b) no other\nrelevant facts are present, then it is no longer a\n\u2018rule-based\u2019 account of precedent\u2014it is simply\nreasserting the minimal requirement that the decision in the later\ncase must not be inconsistent with the result reached in the precedent\ncase.\n\n2.2 Precedents as the application of underlying principles\n\n\nA different response to the problem of distinguishing is to relocate\nthe binding force of precedents in the justification for the\nearlier decision, rather than in the ruling itself. (See Perry 1987,\nesp. 234ff and Moore 1987 for two versions of this view.)  This\napproach has three principal attractions. The first is that it\nexplains the lengthy expositions of the reasoning for the\nresult found in many decisions. It is the reasons that contain the\ngist of the decision, and so it is to this question that most\nattention is directed by the courts in justifying their\ndecisions. Secondly, this accounts for the fact that courts do not\nbother (and indeed lack the power) to lay down a precise formulation\nof their rationes. The ratio does not lay down a\nrule which must be followed by later courts, but is simply a\nconvenient short-hand way of referring to the overall effect of the\nprinciples justifying the result in the case (Perry 1987, 235,\n239). Thirdly, and most significantly, this approach provides a\nnatural explanation for the practice of distinguishing. A later case\nis distinguishable where the justification for the result in\nthe precedent does not apply to the different facts of that case, even\nif it might seem to fall within the ratio of the\ndecision.\n\n\nDespite its attractions, the \u2018underlying principles\u2019\naccount faces three major difficulties: (i) the scope of\ndistinguishing; (ii) accounting for the role played by\nrationes; and (iii) maintaining the distinction between\nprecedent and analogy. The initial difficulty arises from the fact\nthat distinguishing is not restricted to the application of the\njustification provided by the earlier decision. Any good argument can\nprovide the basis for distinguishing, for example by showing that the\nnovel facts in the later case provide considerations which\noutweigh the original justification: it is not that the\noriginal justification is inapplicable to the novel facts, it is\nsimply that those facts raise additional considerations that are more\ncompelling. So later courts go beyond what was done in the earlier\ndecision in determining whether to distinguish the later case.\n\n\nOne possible line of response to these difficulties is to abandon the\nidea that what is binding is the precedent court's\njustification for its decision. After all, the standard view is that\nlater courts are bound by the ruling in the precedent, not its\nreasoning. Instead, it is argued, whether the earlier decision must be\nfollowed in the later case turns on applying the best\njustification for the earlier decision. But not the best\njustification for that decision, taken in isolation. Rather, what is\nbinding in law is the set of principles which best fit and justify the\ntotality of the results in past decisions (e.g. Moore 1987, 201, 210;\ncf. Dworkin 1975,\n 110\u201323[10]).\n From this perspective, distinguishing is not restricted to applying\nthe earlier court's justification for its decision, but in\napplying the justifications for the doctrine of which that decision\nforms a\n part.[11]\n\n\nThe second difficulty, however, applies to both versions of this\napproach, viz. accounting for the role played by\nrationes. The practice of precedent involves later\ncourts being bound to either follow or distinguish\nthe earlier decision, but only if the facts of the later case\nfall within the terms of the ratio. The ratio\nplays an indispensable role in fixing the scope of the later\ncourt's duty to follow or distinguish\u2014it is only if the\nfacts of the later case fall within the ratio that this\nquestion arises. This role is not appropriately captured by\narguing that it is the justifications, and not the ratio,\nwhich are\n binding.[12] \n (Cf. Moore 1987, 185\u20137, 211\u20133). What the approach does\nhelp to highlight, on the other hand, is the role played in the\npractice of precedent by the justification for decisions. As noted\nabove, determining the ratio is not a mechanical exercise: it\ninvolves understanding what was decided in a case\u2014by reference\nto what was said in the judgment, earlier cases, and the general\nunderstanding of that area of the law. The precedent\ncourt's own justification for its decision plays an\nimportant role in determining the level of abstraction of the factors\nin the ratio, and for providing arguments for a narrower or\nwider reading of those\n factors.[13]\n\n\nThis is related to another point: if the underlying justification\nfor a precedent is binding then it undermines the distinction between\narguments from precedent and those by analogy. The ratio\nof the precedent sets the outer limit of what is binding on\nlater courts\u2014i.e., what a later court is bound to either follow or\ndistinguish. Analogies (as will be argued below) are\ngrounded in the underlying rationale for earlier decisions, but they do\nnot bind later courts. If the underlying justification\nof precedents were binding, rather than the ratio, then\nanalogies would be binding and legal reasoning would have a different\nshape.\n2.3 Precedents as decisions on the balance of reasons\n\n\nIf a precedent is not laying down a rule, nor binding in terms of its\nunderlying justification, how should it be regarded?  One\nalternative is to think of the precedent as representing a decision on\nthe balance of reasons in the individual case before the\ncourt that later courts are required to treat as correctly decided\n(see Lamond 2005). The precedent court took a range of facts into\naccount in reaching its decision. Those facts\u2014facts such as the\nbreach of trust, the trustee having power to transfer the property,\nthe recipient being a volunteer, and the good faith of the\nrecipient\u2014ground reasons for reaching some particular legal\nconclusion. On this approach, what the ratio provides is a\nstatement of the factors which the court regarded as providing the\nreasons that were crucial for reaching its result. So the\nratio represents the view of the court that those facts spoke\nin favour of the outcome, and that they were not defeated by any\ncombination of the other factors present in the case. For example, the\ncourt decides that the recipient of trust property must hold the\nproperty on trust if they are a volunteer even though they acted in\ngood faith. In reaching its conclusion the court must deliberate on\nthe competing merits of these two parties and decide which is better\nsupported. Both parties were ignorant of the dishonesty or\nincompetence of the trustee, so neither is favoured on that score; the\nrecipient has acquired property which the trustee did have the legal\npower (though not the right) to transfer, so upholding the security of\nproperty transactions favours allowing the innocent recipient to\nobtain the complete title to the property (leaving the beneficiary\nwith a personal claim for damages against the defaulting trustee); the\nprinciple that no-one can transfer a greater interest than they\npossess favours the beneficiary. Other considerations favour one or\nother of the parties. In making its ruling, the court concludes that\nin the circumstances of the case before it the merits favour the\nbeneficiary of the trust rather than the recipient.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between this approach and that in terms of\nprecedents laying down rules?  It lies in the fact that instead of the\nratio representing a rule which presumptively settles the\ndisposition of later cases whose facts fall within its scope, it\nprovides a pro tanto justification for such a disposition,\ni.e., other things being equal this is how the later case should be\ndecided. And it is this that provides a natural explanation for the\npractice of distinguishing. The correct statement of the doctrine of\nprecedent is that later courts are bound by cases\u2014not\nsimply by rationes\u2014and bound to either follow or\ndistinguish them. So later courts whose case-facts fall within the\nscope of the ratio must consider the precedent, but\ndo so in order to consider whether the differences in facts between\nthe later and the precedent cases justify deciding the cases\ndifferently. What the later court cannot do, on the other hand, is to\ndistinguish on the basis of factors that were present in the\nearlier case (even if they were not part of the decision's\nratio), because to do so would be to imply that the earlier\ndecision had reached the wrong conclusion on the balance of reasons. A\nlater court cannot treat the case as wrongly decided, unless\nit is able and willing to overrule it\n\n\nThe idea that a precedent is reaching a conclusion on the balance of\nreasons in the particular case at hand makes sense of a number of\nother features of common law judgments. It explains the practice of\nproviding elaborate accounts of the circumstances of the\ncase, even though only a small subset of those circumstances matter to\nthe ratio, since they were the group of factors that the\ncourt considered in reaching its decision. It is also consistent with\nthe lengthy discussions of the reasons for the conclusion, and the\nlack of interest on the part of courts in providing a carefully worded\nformulation of the ratio: what matters is the substance of\nthe factors considered in reaching the decision, not the particular\nlanguage in which they are couched.\n\n\nThe main challenge for this account of precedent lies in explaining\nwhen a later court is bound to follow a precedent which it\nregards as having been incorrectly decided. In the case of\nthe trust property, the later court may think the precedent court\nmistaken to have concluded that the recipient must return the property\nto the beneficiary. May a later court avoid the result of the\nprecedent by pointing to any general factual difference\nbetween the cases (e.g. this is real property rather than personal\nproperty, this is an implied rather than an express trust), and\ndistinguish the precedent by stating a narrower ratio?  After\nall, the balance of reasons never supported the precedent in the first\nplace, so shouldn't it be confined to the narrowest possible\nstatement of its facts?  In which case precedents seem to have very\nlittle binding force indeed.\n\n\nOne obvious possibility for avoiding this problem would be to ask how\nthe precedent court would have assessed the facts in later\ncase. But although this would be satisfactory in theory (if sometimes\ndifficult in practice), it again does not reflect legal\npractice. Courts sometimes approach the question in this way, but\noften they do not, and there is no legal requirement that\nthey do so. A better response is this: the basic common law\nrequirement in stare decisis is to treat earlier cases as\ncorrectly decided. A case may be distinguished, but only if that\ndistinction does not imply that the precedent was wrongly decided. So\nin the later case the court must decide whether the factual difference\n(real versus personal property, implied versus express trust) provides\na better justification against the earlier decision than the\nfacts of that case on their own. If it does, then the court may\ndistinguish (citing that differences with the original case), since\nthat does not imply that precedent was mistaken. If\nnot\u2014because real property or implied trusts raise no special\nconsiderations in this context\u2014then the precedent must be\nfollowed. This approach, of course, assumes that it is\npossible to make these sorts of comparative judgements (for arguments\nthat this is not generally possible see Alexander 1989, 34\u20137).\n3. The Justifications for Precedent\n\n\nMost discussions of precedent focus on the justifications for having a\ndoctrine of stare decisis by which later courts are bound to\nfollow earlier decisions. There is, of course, a prior question of why\nthe decisions of courts should be regarded as making law at\nall. In some Civilian legal systems, such as the French, the official\nview is that court decisions do not make law, they merely involve the\napplication of the law. This follows from a straightforward\nunderstanding of the separation of powers: the responsibility of the\nlegislator is to make law, the responsibility of the judiciary is to\nfaithfully apply the law made by the legislator. For the courts to\nmake law would be to usurp the legislative function, and to usurp a\nfunction to which the courts have no legitimate claim. One distinctive\nfeature of Common Law systems is the existence of central areas of law\nthat have no legislative foundations\u2014such as contract, tort,\ntrusts, and personal property. All of these areas have seen\nlegislative intervention, but most Common Law jurisdictions still\nleave them on a non-statutory footing. Here the decisions of the\ncourts are the basis of the law.\n\n\nIn practice no modern legal system has functioned without the\ndecisions of the courts playing at least an auxiliary role in settling\nthe content of the law. To take one well-known example, in France the\nlaw of civil wrongs (torts, delicts) is based upon five relatively\nshort articles of the Code Civil (\u00a7\u00a7\n1382\u20131386). Formally, the law is found in those five articles,\nand a court decision is legally flawed if it does not cite at least\none of them as the basis for its ruling. But there is a vast body of\ncases interpreting and applying those articles, and these cases are\nregularly cited before the courts to assist them in reaching their\ndecisions, even though judgments themselves do not mention earlier\ncases. In substance, then, if not in form, this area is partly\nconstituted by judge-made law.\n\n\nSo one question that can be raised about precedent is why it is\njustifiable for the decisions of courts to be treated in this way at\nall, i.e., for them to help constitute the law. There is a more\nspecialised question, however. In the Common Law at least, the\ndoctrine of stare decisis requires later courts to follow\nearlier decisions even if they were wrongly decided. To say that a\ncase was \u2018wrongly decided\u2019 is to say that the legally\npermissible reasons relevant to the case did not, all things\nconsidered, support the conclusion reached by the court. It should be\nemphasised that such a conclusion depends upon and is relative to the\ncontext provided by existing legal doctrine. Take the question of\nwhether parents should be able to recover for the cost of raising a\nhealthy child when it has been born as a result of a negligently\nperformed sterilisation operation on one of the parents. In some legal\nsystems such costs are recoverable, whereas in others they are\nnot. Here it is quite possible that these conflicting decisions are\nboth correct, in the sense that each is correct within its own\ndoctrinal context. So whether a decision is wrong is not a question of\nhow the case ought to be decided without any reference to the law, but\nwhether it goes against the merits of the legally relevant\nreasons.\n\n\nThe doctrine of precedent thus raises two justificatory issues: (a)\nwhy treat court decisions as partly constituting the law, and (b) why\nrequire later courts to follow erroneous decisions of earlier\n courts?[14]\n The most influential arguments responding to these issues are based\nupon considerations of:\n\nconsistency\nexpectations\nreplicability\nthe need for law-making\n\n\n\n(For general discussions of the justification for precedent, see:\nSchauer 1987, 595\u2013602, Golding 1984, 98\u2013100, Benditt 1987,\n89\u201393.)\n3.1 Consistency\n\n\nThe argument from consistency is related to arguments in favour of\n\u2018formal\u2019 justice, i.e., that two cases which are the same\n(in relevant respects) should be treated in the same way. It would\nsimply be inconsistent to treat them differently. In the case of\nprecedent this argument is said to favour following the earlier case:\nassuming that one cannot change the earlier decision (because it is\ntoo late to appeal, or the party to the case has reasonably relied\nupon it, etc), the only way to ensure consistency is for later\ndecision-makers to treat the earlier decision as a precedent. The\nclaim of consistency is also sometimes put in terms of\n\u2018equality\u2019: to treat the later case differently to the\nfirst would be to fail to treat the parties before the courts\nequally. This argument is made independently of other concerns such as\nparties' expectations or community perceptions of the court\nprocess or the problem of moral disagreement. Arguments of this kind\ncertainly have weight in some circumstances. If a legal system is\nmorally legitimate and has authority over those subject to it, then it\nis inconsistent for one person to be treated less or more favourably\nby the law than another person whose situation is legally\nindistinguishable. Other things being equal, legal decisions should be\nconsistent across time and/or decision-makers. A later case should\nonly be treated differently to an earlier case when the law itself has\nbeen changed (by the legislator or the courts, including cases where\nthe court overrules an earlier decision in reaching a decision on the\ncase before it) So concerns of consistency provide some justification\nfor treating earlier decisions as sources of law, rather than\napproaching each question anew when it arises again.\n\n\nThis fact does not, however, support a doctrine of following earlier\ndecisions even when they are wrong, i.e., for having a strong\npractice of stare decisis. If the earlier decision was wrong\nthen the person subject to it may have been treated more or less\nfavourably than they should have been treated. If they were treated\nmore favourably then clearly that should have been corrected (e.g. on\nappeal). If it was not corrected then the person had an undeserved\nslice of good fortune. But that a mistake was made in the earlier case\nis not\u2014in itself\u2014an argument for repeating the mistake in\nthe later case. The first litigant did not deserve their outcome, even\nif for reasons of the finality of legal processes they are entitled to\nretain it. Equality does not demand the repetition of mistakes. On the\nother hand, if the original litigant was treated less favourably than\nthey deserved then again that mistake should be corrected if it can be\n(e.g. by appeal, or, if that is too late, by remedial legislation or\nby executive action such as pardon or ex gratia payments),\nbut it is no reason for treating a later litigant unfavourably as\nwell. Taken in isolation from other considerations (such as\nexpectations and predictability), equality does not support the\nbindingness of incorrect decisions.\n\n\nBy contrast, arguments of equality bite where the court in the\noriginal case was confronted with a situation where the correct\noutcome was indeterminate, i.e., where more than one outcome was\npossible in light of the legally permissible arguments. This may be\ndue to each outcome being equally well supported by reason, or by the\noutcomes being supported by different, incommensurable, values. In\nsome of these cases the law has closure rules to settle the matter,\ne.g. in favour of criminal defendants, but in others there are no\nclosure rules as to the appropriate substantive result to endorse. A\npossible illustration of such indeterminacy is the position of a\nperson who quite innocently buys stolen goods. In some legal systems\nthe purchaser acquires good title to those goods, whereas in others\n(such as the Common Law) she does not. Here, arguably, the merits of\nthe two innocent parties (the purchaser and the original owner) are on\na par, and all the law can do is choose which one is to prevail.  So\nwhere an outcome is underdetermined there are arguments of equality\nfor later courts following the earlier decision rather than adopting\nany of the other possible solutions. None of this, of course, is an\nargument for following earlier decisions that were wrongly decided,\nsince these are cases where the earlier court did not make a mistake,\nbut took one permissible option.\n3.2 Expectations\n\n\nAnother common argument in favour of precedent is in terms of\nprotecting expectations: if an institution has dealt with an issue in\none way in the past, then that creates the expectation that it will do\nso in the future\u2014an expectation which people use to plan their\nlives and enjoy some control over their\n situations.[15] \n So there are good reasons for an institution to follow its previous\ndecisions (other things being equal), even if it turns out that they\nwere mistaken.\n\n\nThe fundamental problem with this line of argument in the case of\nprecedent is that it suffers from a type of circularity. It is true\nthat legal systems that follow a practice of precedent create\nexpectations that earlier decisions will be followed in the\nfuture. But it is important to bear in mind that it is only\nlegitimate expectations which need to be considered in\ndecision-making, not any expectation which someone forms. The mere\nfact that a decision was made in the past provides no reason in itself\nto expect that it will be followed in the future, and certainly\ncreates no entitlement to expect that it will be followed. That a\ncompany orders stationery from a supplier at the start of the year may\nraise a hope, and even possibly an expectation, that it will do so\nagain later in the year, but the supplier does not have a\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 expectation that it will do so, and the\ncompany does not create a precedent for itself. Where there\nis an institutional practice of following past decisions, on\nthe other hand, the reliance of those subject to future decisions may\nground legitimate expectations, but it is always open to the\ninstitution to announce that it will no longer treat past decisions as\nbinding and will, instead, decide each case on its merits.  Equally,\nit is a common occurrence in some institutional settings where past\ndecisions are followed for a decision to be made subject to\nthe proviso that it is \u2018not setting a precedent\u2019 for the\nfuture. \n\n\nWhether a past decision creates legitimate expectations, therefore,\ndepends upon there being good independent reasons for the institution\nto follow its earlier decisions, or upon the existence of a practice\nof doing so. But the practice itself should only be maintained if\nthere are good independent reasons for having it: its mere existence\ncannot bootstrap a justification for the maintenance of the\npractice.\n3.3 Replicability\n\n\nThe preceding arguments for precedent presuppose that decision-makers\ncan correctly ascertain the merits of the cases before them, but law\nof course operates under non-ideal conditions where decision-makers\nmake mistakes and disagree among themselves about the merits of\ncases. In practice, the outcome of a case may be uncertain not simply\nbecause the correct result is rationally indeterminate, but because\nthe decision-makers are fallible.  Given this, a practice of precedent\nin law, it can be argued, has a number of advantages due the fact that\nit may make institutional decisions replicable (see Eisenberg\n1988, 10\u201312, 23\u20134, whose coinage it is; and Schauer 1987,\n597\u20138).  That a decision is replicable refers to the fact that\nit is possible for others to make an informed judgement on the\nlikelihood of a particular outcome, in the light of the relevant legal\nmaterials, the canons of reasoning used in a system, and an\nacquaintance with the general culture from which the decision-makers\nare drawn.  Replicability means that decisions are more predictable\nthan if they were made de novo each time. This, in turn,\nallows individuals to make plans that are consistent with the law and\nto avoid falling foul of it, and hence allows them to be guided by the\nlaw.\n\n\nThis provides a rationale both for treating earlier cases as\ncontributing to the law and for the doctrine of stare\ndecisis. Other things being equal, it is better if the law is\npredictable than if it is unpredictable. It should be noted, however,\nthat such a rationale does not necessarily support as strong a\ndoctrine of precedent as that found in many Common Law\njurisdictions. The concern for predictability needs to be weighed\nagainst the moral desirability of the law in question. This would\nsuggest that (a) in some circumstances lower courts should be allowed\nto depart from the decisions of higher courts where their view is that\nthe earlier decision was (in the context of the relevant law) clearly\nmorally undesirable, (b) giving greater freedom to courts to overrule\ntheir own decisions on the basis that there was a morally preferable\ndecision (in that legal context).\n3.4 Law-making\n\n\nA final justification for the doctrine of precedent is that it is\ndesirable to give courts the power to make law. The thought\nhere is that it is valuable for the courts to have the power to\nimprove and supplement the law (Hart 1994, 135\u20136; Raz 1979,\n194\u2013201). The assumption underlying this justification is that\nthe law is sometimes incomplete and in need of being given greater\nspecificity, or that it is erroneous and needs to be corrected.  On\nthis view the courts are analogous to delegated legislators: they have\nlimited powers to make law within a broader framework of doctrine.\n\n\nAlthough the need for law-making is often cited as a justification for\nprecedent, the substance of the argument normally boils down to\nconcerns with either equality or replicability. If the law has\nresolved an indeterminacy in one (acceptable) way in the past, then\nprecedent helps to ensure that future litigants are treated as\n(un)favourably as past litigants, and so all are treated equally. In\naddition, if the application of the law is indeterminate, due to the\ntype of value conflict involved or the nature of the decision-makers,\nthen it is desirable for judicial decisions to constitute precedents\nin order to make the law more replicable in the future. \n\n\nOn the other hand, if the argument in favour of courts having\nlaw-making power is that they can thereby improve the law, this is\nreally an argument in favour of having the power to overrule\nprecedents, rather than an argument in favour of precedent in the\nfirst place. Indeed, the need for a power to overrule only arises if\nearlier decisions are binding even when mistaken, since later courts\ncould otherwise simply disregard decisions that were erroneous.  So\nthe argument from law-making, when distinct from arguments from\nreplicability and equality, is an argument for the power to overrule,\nrather than an argument for stare decisis\n itself.[16] \n\n\nIn conclusion, both equality and replicability provide arguments in\nfavour of judicial decisions constituting sources of law. And the\nvalue of replicability also supports a doctrine of stare\ndecisis by which later courts are sometimes bound even by the\nerroneous decisions of earlier courts. This in turn leads to the need\nfor courts to have the power to overrule existing law, so that there\nis scope for incorrect decisions to be reversed.\n4. Analogy\n\n\nAn analogical argument in legal reasoning is an argument that a case\nshould be treated in a certain way because that is the way a\nsimilar case has been treated. Arguments by analogy\ncomplement arguments from precedent in two ways: (i) they are used\nwhen the facts of a case do not fall within the ratio of any\nprecedent, in order to assimilate the result to that in the analogical\ncase; and (ii) they are used when the facts of a case do fall\nwithin the ratio of a precedent, as a basis for distinguishing the\ncase at hand from the precedent. The force of an argument\nfrom analogy is different to that from precedent. An indistinguishable\nprecedent must be followed unless the court has the power to overrule\nthe earlier decision and does so. By contrast, arguments from analogy\nvary in their strengths: from very \u2018close\u2019 analogies\n(which strongly support a result) to more \u2018remote\u2019\nanalogies (which weakly support a result).  Analogies do not bind:\nthey must be considered along with other reasons in order to reach a\nresult. That an analogy is rejected in one case does not preclude\nraising the analogy in a different case.\n\n\nAnalogies, like precedents, arise within a doctrinal context.  The\ncase at hand raises a legal issue, e.g. does the impersonation of a\nboyfriend vitiate the victim's consent in the law of rape, is\ncross-burning protected \u2018speech\u2019 within the First\nAmendment to the US Constitution, does the defence of duress require\nthe defendant to have acted as a reasonable person would have done?\nOther cases dealing with the validity of consent or the scope of\nprotected \u2018speech\u2019 or reasonableness in defences provide\npotential analogies. An analogy may either be to another case or to\nanother legal doctrine, and the analogy rests on there being some\ncommon characterisation of the facts in both cases or the two\ndoctrines which is relevant to the issue. So knives may be analogous\nto guns if the issue concerns weapons, but knives may also be\nanalogous to teaspoons if the issue concerns cutlery. Duress may be\nanalogous to provocation if the issue concerns defences, but duress\nmay also be analogous to incitement if the issue concerns\ncomplicity. Two doctrines or sets of facts are not analogous in the\nabstract, but in the context of a legal\n issue.[17]\n\n\nTwo questions arise about analogical reasoning. Firstly, by what\nprocess does a decision-maker identify the \u2018common\ncharacterisation\u2019 between the case at hand and the analogous\none?  Secondly, what type of justificatory force does the common\ncharacterisation provide?  On the first question, just as no two cases\nare identical in every respect, so no two cases are such that some\ncommon characterisation of the facts cannot be found. But not every\ncase is thought to provide an analogy, so what limits or directs the\nselection of analogies?  The answer to this question flows into the\nissue of the justificatory force of analogies.  What sort of reason\ndoes an analogy provide for deciding the instant case in the same\nway?\n\n\nIt is widely agreed that the existence of an analogy depends\nultimately upon the justification for the analogical\ndecision. The facts in a case may fall outside the ratio of\nan existing precedent, and thus the court is not bound by the\nprecedent. On the other hand the justification for the\nearlier decision may apply to the later case, and thus provide an\nargument from analogy. Take the case of the impersonation of a\nboyfriend in the law of rape. Assume that there is authority for the\nproposition that the impersonation of a husband vitiates consent for\nthe purposes of rape. Whether the impersonation of a boyfriend is\nanalogous depends upon why such a marital impersonation vitiates\nconsent. If it is thought that part of the significance of being\nmarried is the sharing of physical intimacy with that particular\nperson, then the rationale is applicable to other close personal\nrelationships. If instead the rationale is that consent to an\nimpersonator involves committing an act of adultery, i.e., an act\ndifferent in kind to that consented to, then although the two\nsituations are obviously very similar, the analogy will fail.\n\n\nIt is often argued that reasoning by analogy and distinguishing\nprecedents are mirror images of each other: given the facts of two\ncases, the question is whether there is a good reason for treating\nthem differently (e.g. Eisenberg 1988, 87). In the case of\ndistinguishing, a precedent must be followed unless there are good\nreasons for treating it differently. In the case of analogy, it is\nsaid, a precedent must be extended unless there are good reasons for\ntreating the instant case differently. But this is misleading, since\nthe symmetry is incomplete. A precedent cannot be distinguished on\ngrounds that would, in substance, imply that the precedent was wrongly\ndecided: it must be treated as correctly decided. A precedent need not\nbe extended, however, if later courts regard its rationale as\nunpersuasive. A longstanding doctrine of the common law was that a\nhusband could not commit the offence of rape against his wife. By the\ntwentieth century the rule was increasingly recognised to be archaic\nand objectionable.  Thus, unlike the question of impersonation discussed\nabove, no one suggested that the rule should be\nextended to cohabiting\n couples.[18] \n Where a decision is not regarded as misguided, however, it does\nprovide an argument for being followed. The later court may still\ndecide, however, that it would not be desirable, all things\nconsidered, to do so.\n\n\nThe explanation for the justificatory force of such resemblances is,\nhowever, controversial. There are two major alternative accounts, the\none relying on principles, the other on reasons.\n4.1 Principles\n\n\nAn influential view on analogy regards it as grounded in the\nprinciples that underlie existing cases (e.g. MacCormick\n1978, 152\u201394; Eisenberg 1988, 83\u201396; Sunstein 1993). A\nbody of cases can be examined to determine which principle (or set of\ncoherent principles) explains and justifies those decisions, in a\nprocess akin to reflective equilibrium. The process is only akin to\nreflective equilibrium because the individual cases (the equivalent of\nthe specific judgements about particular situations) are either immune\nfrom revision, or are highly resistant to revision.\n So the principles must map the decided cases precisely, or must\ndepart from only a small proportion of them. If the principle(s)\nidentified in this process apply to the instant case, then that\nprovides a good reason in favour of the result supported by the\nprinciple.\n\n\nA number of criticisms question whether this account captures what is\nnormally going on in analogical reasoning. One criticism focuses on\nthe fact that the principle must track the existing cases and try to\nmake the best of them. Unless the decisions are all correct on the\nmerits, any principle based on them must itself be flawed: for if it\nwere morally correct it would not support the mistaken decisions. The\nquestion this raises is whether it can be justifiable to use such a\nprinciple to decide a novel case, rather than decide the case on its\nown merits. Can there be \u2018principles\u2019 of this kind, which\nare neither conventional parts of a practice nor morally correct?\n(see further Alexander 1996b, 1998, Alexander and Kress 1995, 1997) A\nmore common view, however, is that a principle that makes best sense\nof a series of cases or aspects of legal doctrine can have some\njustificatory force even though the cases or doctrines are morally\nimperfect. In the case of tort liability, for example, the cases might\nbe best explained by the principle that liability will only arise\nwhere the defendant's conduct has been unreasonable, i.e., that\nboth harm to the plaintiff and unreasonable conduct is necessary for\nliability. This principle may be morally mistaken, i.e., there may be\nsituations where even reasonable conduct should result in legal\nliability. Nevertheless the principle may still be regarded as having\nsome justificatory force in the context of that legal system. A judge\nmight think that the correct moral principle is that other things\nbeing equal there should be no liability without unreasonable\nconduct. But although the law is imperfect in this way, the legal\nprinciple still has some force because it is a near enough neighbour\nto the correct principle and it explains the existing\n cases.[19]\n\n\nA separate line of criticism centres on the fact that courts do not\noften articulate their use of analogies in terms of some\n\u2018principle\u2019 inherent in an earlier case. Where principles\nare used as arguments for a result, earlier cases tend to be cited as\nillustrations of the application of the principle, rather than as\nanalogies to the facts of the case at hand. If another case\nis cited as providing an analogy, the emphasis will be on how\n\u2018close\u2019 the analogy is, i.e., on how specific the common\ncharacterisation of the facts of the two cases is, and how that\ncharacterisation relates to the rationale for the earlier\ndecision. The more specific an analogy, the stronger; the more\nabstract the characterisation, the weaker the argument as an\nanalogy. The reason for this is that the more specific the analogy,\nthe less room there is for distinguishing the two cases, whereas the\nmore abstract the analogy the more grounds on which the two cases may\nbe regarded as significantly different. So if it is lawful to consent\nto tatooing, it is also lawful to consent to a decorative branding,\nwhich is closely\n analogous.[20] \n On the other hand, the analogy of boxing to sadomasochistic\nactivities is more remote, although both involve the intentional\ninfliction of a certain level of\n harm.[21]\n\n\nThis last point relates to the fact that cases are rarely justified\nsolely on the basis of principles: instead there are a range of\nconsiderations which are applicable and justify the result. A\nprinciple may apply with equal force to two cases with very different\nfacts, but those differences may make the cases not very\nanalogous. What this suggests is that while principles do provide\narguments for reaching a certain result, they do not explain the\nnature of analogical reasoning.\n4.2 Reasons\n\n\nThe reasons-based approach to analogical reasoning focuses on the\njustifications for the analogical case (for two very different\naccounts see Raz 1979, 201\u20136 and Brewer 1996). It considers the\nextent to which the rationale for the decision in the earlier case is\napplicable to the case at hand. Take the case of the impersonation of\na boyfriend in the law of rape. Whether this situation is analogous to\nthe impersonation of a husband depends on the reasons for the latter\nvitiating consent. There need be no single principle that underlies\nthe rationale: it may rest on a number of factors that reinforce the\nconclusion.\n\n\nOne consequence of this approach is that if the rationale for the\nearlier decision is tied exclusively to the particular category used\nin the ratio, there will be no scope for analogical extension\nto broader categories. In English law duress is not a defence to\nmurder regardless of the circumstances, due (it is said) to the\nuniqueness of deliberate killing and the fact that duress is, at best,\nan excuse. On this rationale there is no room for arguing that duress\nshould be excluded in cases of physically disabling a victim. On the\nquestion of whether duress could be a partial defence to\nmurder, on the other hand, there is an arguable analogy to\nthe excuse of provocation, which operates to reduce murder to\nmanslaughter. Killing may be inexcusable, but that does not mean that\nevery deliberate killing warrants a conviction for murder. Of\ncourse, duress involves an actual decision to kill, whereas\nprovocation a temporary loss of self-control. The case for reducing\nkilling under duress to manslaughter depends upon whether the\nrationale for provocation (e.g. as a concession to human frailty)\nextends to it. Two factors\u2014the defendant's loss of\nself-control and the victim's involvement in the\nkilling\u2014readily distinguish the two situations, and weaken any\nanalogy.\n\n\nThe reasons-based approach helps to explain why individual cases, and\nindividual doctrines, can ground analogies. It also explains what is\naccurate in the principles-based approach, since some of the\nconsiderations underlying analogical cases will be principles.  But\nthere are more legal considerations than principles, and these too\nplay a role in analogical reasoning.\n5. The Justification for Analogical Reasoning\n\n\nWhy does the law make use of arguments by analogy, rather than simply\ndeciding novel cases on their own merits?  In ordinary moral\ndeliberation, analogies are used to argue that one disputed situation\nis indistinguishable from another situation where the merits are\nrelatively clear. They leave three main responses open: (a) that the\ncase is indeed indistinguishable since the same rationale applies to\nboth; (b) that the case is distinguishable; or (c) that the case is\nindistinguishable, but upon reflection the assessment of the original\ncase was mistaken. (Reflection on another case might, of course, lead\none to conclude that one's original assessment was mistaken, even\nthough the two cases are distinguishable.)  As a result,\nanalogies are useful heuristic devices for deepening and sharpening\nreflection on the merits. It is also the case that people are often\nmore confident in their judgements about various concrete cases than\nthey are about abstract theories that attempt to account for their\njudgements, and so regard this is a more profitable way to approach a\nquestion (see Sunstein 1993, 775\u20137).\n\n\nIn law, by contrast, analogies carry a weight additional to the merits\nof the case. The approach of courts is complex. Some decisions and\ndoctrines are regarded as mistakes and have no analogical\nweight. Other doctrines may be regarded as imperfect\u2014not wholly\ncorrect\u2014but do have analogical weight. Other still may be\nregarded as simply correct, and their existence provides further\nsupport for adopting the view in the novel case. There are a number of\npossible indirect benefits that accrue from the practice of analogical\nreasoning, such as exposing judges to a wider variety of fact\nsituations than the particular set before them, making them consider\nthe views of other judges in previous cases and exerting a\nconservative pressure on individual decision-makers (see Sherwin\n1999). But is there any more fundamental rationale to the form of\nreasoning?\n\n\nLike precedent, analogies cannot be justified by recourse to\nexpectations. Whether there is an expectation of analogies being\nfollowed, such expectations will only be justified if there are good\nindependent reasons for using analogies in this way. Consistency may\nprovide a rationale for a limited exercise of analogy. Where an\nearlier case has settled some indeterminacy in the application of the\nlaw, and where the rationale for the earlier decision is equally\napplicable to the later facts, then it would be inconsistent to decide\nthe later case differently.\n\n\nThe strongest justification for analogical reasoning, however, lies in\nthe value of replicability. This is often put in terms of the\nimportance of \u2018coherence\u2019 in the law (MacCormick 1978,\n153, 187\u20138; Sunstein 1993, 778\u20139; see also Raz 1979,\n204\u20136 on \u2018partial reform\u2019). Arguments in favour of\ncoherence normally emphasise its instrumental\n value.[22]\n This is tied up with the replicability of legal\ndecision-making. There are two important characteristics of legal\ndecision-making. The first is the fragmentary nature of legal\nmaterials. The second is the plurality of decision-making\nbodies. Legal materials\u2014precedents, statutes, conventions,\nprinciples\u2014are fragmentary in two senses: (a) they are the work\nof many different hands at different times and with different outlooks\nand (b) different areas of law owe more to some hands and times than\nothers. As a result legal doctrine tends to exhibit only a thin global\ncoherence, whereas it may possess a thick local coherence.  The\npluralism of decision-makers is also two-fold: (a) there are many\nindividuals making decisions using the same body of materials, and (b)\nthese individuals do not share a uniform evaluative outlook. Given the\nfragmentary nature of legal material and the plurality of\ndecision-makers there is considerable scope for disagreement when\ndecision-makers are faced with novel questions.\n\n\nAnalogical reasoning helps to make the outcome of cases more\npredictable by giving weight to existing legal decisions and\ndoctrines. But it only does so against a certain background, one where\ndespite decision-makers not sharing a uniform normative outlook, there\nis a large measure of agreement on the existence and importance of\ncertain values. A certain level of agreement is required for\ndecision-makers to see a case as analogous, since that rests\non what they judge to be the proper justification for the earlier\ndecision. It also means that while they may disagree on the resolution\nreached in various cases, the disagreement is unlikely to be profound,\nbut reasonable. (For an argument that this requirement can be\noverstated, see Sunstein 1993, 769\u201373).\n\n\nThe use of analogies in law, then, serves to compensate for some of\nthe indeterminacy which flows from fragmented materials and the\npluralism of decision-makers. That a close analogy exists usually\nprovides a good reason for deciding the case the same way, since it\nrenders the law more replicable than it would otherwise be, and\nenables lawyers to predict more accurately how a situation will be\ntreated by the law. Of course, this is only a relative value:\nanalogies can be defeated by other considerations if there is a good\nbasis for distinguishing, or if its merits are too weak. \n6. Summary\n\n\nPrecedent and analogy are two central and complementary forms of legal\nargument. What makes them characteristic of legal reasoning\nis the circumstances of decision-making in law. The greatest contrast\nis with individual reasoning, where neither precedent nor analogy have\nthe same significance. An individual may give weight to what she has\ndone in the past, e.g. because she believes the decision was made\nunder optimum conditions, or she should not or does not want to\ndisappoint someone's expectations, or there are special reasons\nto treat the two situations identically.  Similarly, the comparison of\nthe problem at hand with another situation may help clarify\none's thinking, but one's judgement on the other case is\nonly relevant to the extent that it is correct.\n\n\nIn an institutionalised system with many decision-makers and a\nheterogeneous group of legal materials there is a tension between\ndecision-making being relatively predictable for those to whom it will\napply and the law being morally improved. In such a context precedent\nand analogy help to shore up the predictability of decisions whilst\nleaving room for courts to improve the law. They do this in two\ndifferent ways. Precedents are distinguishable (and subject to\noverruling), while analogies provide non-conclusive reasons for\nreaching a particular outcome. The success of these compromises\ndepends upon there being a fair measure of background agreement\nbetween decision-makers over the important values served by the\nlaw\u2014both measures would be too weak in the face of widespread\nand deep value disagreement. A range of mechanisms exist in law that\nhelp maintain such a relative consensus: legal education, the working\nenvironment, and the selection of candidates for the bench all tend to\nproduce more convergence than is found in the general community. In\naddition, there is an internal feedback element\u2014in deciding\ncases, courts are aware that their decisions can be distinguished (as\nwell as overruled), and that it is only their ruling that are binding\non later courts. This gives them good reasons to press justifications\nthat are based on values widely endorsed by their brethren.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, L., 1989,  \u2018Constrained by Precedent\u2019,\n<em>Southern California Law Review</em> 63: 1\u201364", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996a, \u2018Precedent\u2019 in <em>A\nCompanion to the Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory</em>, Patterson\n(ed), Oxford: Blackwell", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996b, \u2018Bad Beginnings\u2019,\n<em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</em> 145: 57\u201387", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1998, \u2018The Banality of Legal\nReasoning\u2019, <em>Notre Dame Law Review</em> 73: 517\u201333", "Alexander, L. and Kress, K., 1995, \u2018Against Legal\nPrinciples\u2019 in A.
