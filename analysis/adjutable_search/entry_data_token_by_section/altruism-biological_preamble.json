    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn evolutionary biology, an organism is said to behave\naltruistically when its behaviour benefits other organisms, at a cost\nto itself. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of\nreproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by\nbehaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it\nis likely to produce itself, but boosts the number that other organisms\nare likely to produce. This biological notion of altruism is not\nidentical to the everyday concept. In everyday parlance, an action\nwould only be called \u2018altruistic\u2019 if it was done with the\nconscious intention of helping another. But in the biological sense\nthere is no such requirement. Indeed, some of the most interesting\nexamples of biological altruism are found among creatures that are\n(presumably) not capable of conscious thought at all, e.g. insects. For\nthe biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive\nfitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the\nintentions, if any, with which the action is performed.\n\n\nAltruistic behaviour is common throughout the animal kingdom,\nparticularly in species with complex social structures. For example,\nvampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members\nof their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not\nstarve. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in\nraising its young from other \u2018helper\u2019 birds, who protect\nthe nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. Vervet monkeys\ngive alarm calls to warn fellow monkeys of the presence of predators,\neven though in doing so they attract attention to themselves,\nincreasing their personal chance of being attacked. In social insect\ncolonies (ants, wasps, bees and termites), sterile workers devote their\nwhole lives to caring for the queen, constructing and protecting the\nnest, foraging for food, and tending the larvae. Such behaviour is\nmaximally altruistic: sterile workers obviously do not leave any\noffspring of their own\u2014so have personal fitness of zero\u2014but their\nactions greatly assist the reproductive efforts of the queen.\n\n\nFrom a Darwinian viewpoint, the existence of altruism in nature is\nat first sight puzzling, as Darwin himself realized. Natural selection\nleads us to expect animals to behave in ways that increase their\nown chances of survival and reproduction, not those of others.\nBut by behaving altruistically an animal reduces its own fitness, so\nshould be at a selective disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis one which\nbehaves selfishly. To see this, imagine that some members of a group of\nVervet monkeys give alarm calls when they see predators, but others do\nnot. Other things being equal, the latter will have an advantage. By\nselfishly refusing to give an alarm call, a monkey can reduce the\nchance that it will itself be attacked, while at the same time\nbenefiting from the alarm calls of others. So we should expect natural\nselection to favour those monkeys that do not give alarm calls over\nthose that do. But this raises an immediate puzzle. How did the\nalarm-calling behaviour evolve in the first place, and why has it not\nbeen eliminated by natural selection? How can the existence of altruism\nbe reconciled with basic Darwinian principles?\n",
