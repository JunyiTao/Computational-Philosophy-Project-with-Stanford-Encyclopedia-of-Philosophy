    "main_text": "\n\nIn addition to being one of the most original and talented physicians,\nmathematicians and astrologers of his time, Girolamo Cardano (b. 1501,\nPavia, d. 1576, Rome) occupies an important place in the history of\nRenaissance philosophy. His contributions range from a comprehensive\naccount of order in all its various meanings (natural, human, and\ndivine) to epistemological and methodological directions concerning\nthe progress of knowledge, from an elaborate theory of the immortality\nof the soul to a sophisticated analysis of the role of practical\nwisdom (prudentia) in such diverse human activities as\nmedicine and political action.\n",
