    "main_text": "The Later Philosophy || Safeguarding\n3.4 Safeguarding\n\n\nHeidegger argues that if humankind is to enter into safeguarding, it\nneeds to learn (or perhaps to learn once more) to think of Being as a\ngift that has been granted to us in history. Indeed, to think properly\nis precisely to be grateful for the gift of Being (see What is\nCalled Thinking?). (Terms such as \u2018gift\u2019 and\n\u2018granted\u2019 should not be heard theologically, but in terms\nof secularized sacredness and destining.) In this learning process,\ncertain artworks constitute ontological beacons that disrupt the\ntechnological clearing. Thus recall that Heidegger identifies a shared\nform of disclosure that is instantiated both by the old wooden bridge\nover the Rhine and by H\u00f6lderlin's poem \u201cThe\nRhine\u201d. We can now understand this identification in terms of the\nclaim that certain artworks (although of course not those that\nthemselves fall prey to technological thinking) share with traditional\nartisanship the capacity to realize poiesis. In so doing such artworks\nsucceed in bringing us into contact with the mystery through their\nexpression of dwelling (poetic habitation). In listening attentively\nand gratefully to how Being announces itself in such artworks,\nhumankind will prepare themselves for the task of\nsafeguarding.\n\n\nBut what exactly would one do in order to safeguard the\nfourfold in its essential unfolding. Recall that in Building\nDwelling Thinking Heidegger presents safeguarding as a\nfour-dimensional way of Being. The first two dimensions\u2014saving\nthe earth and receiving the sky as sky\u2014refer to our\nrelationship with the non-human natural world. As such they forge a\ngenuine connection between the later Heidegger and contemporary\nenvironmentalist thinking. However, the connection needs to be stated\nwith care. Once again the concept of poiesis is central. Heidegger\nholds that the self-organized unfolding of the natural world, the\nunaided blossoming of nature, is itself a process of poiesis.\nIndeed it is poiesis \u201cin the highest sense\u201d (Question\nConcerning Technology 317). One might think, then, that saving the\nearth, safeguarding in its first dimension, is a matter of leaving\nnature to its own devices, of actively ensuring that the conditions\nobtain for unaided natural poiesis. However, for Heidegger, saving the\nearth is primarily an ontological, rather than an ecological, project.\n\u2018Save\u2019 here means \u201cto set something free into its own\nessence\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking, p.352), and thus\njoins a cluster of related concepts that includes dwelling and also\npoiesis as realized in artisanship and art. So while, say,\nfiercely guarding the integrity of wilderness areas may be one route to\nsafeguarding, saving the earth may also be achieved through the kind of\nartisanship and its associated gathering of natural materials that is\ncharacteristic of the traditional cabinetmaker. The concept of saving\nas a setting free of something into its own essence also clears a path\nto another important point. All four dimensions of safeguarding have at\ntheir root the notion of staying with things, of letting\nthings be in their essence through cultivation or construction.\nHeidegger describes such staying with things as \u201cthe only way in\nwhich the fourfold stay within the fourfold [i.e., safeguarding] is\naccomplished at any time in simple unity\u201d (Building Dwelling\nThinking 353). It is thus the unifying existential structure of\nsafeguarding.\n\n\nWhat now of safeguarding in its second dimension\u2014to receive\nthe sky as sky? Here Heidegger's main concern seems to be to\nadvocate the synchronization of contemporary human life with the\nrhythms of nature (day and night, the seasons, and so on). Here\nsafeguarding is exemplified by the aforementioned peasants whose lives\nwere interlocked with such natural rhythms (through planting seasons\netc.) in a way that modern technological society is not. One might note\nthat this dislocation has become even more pronounced since\nHeidegger's death, with the advent of the Internet-driven,\n24-hours-a-day-7-days-a-week service culture. Once again we need to\nemphasize that Heidegger's position is not some sort of\nphilosophical ludditism, but a plea for the use of contemporary\nmachines and devices in a way that is sensitive to the temporal\npatterns of the natural world. (For useful discussion see Young 2002,\n110\u2013113. Young makes an illuminating connection with Heidegger's\neulogy to van Gogh's painting of a pair of peasant shoes to be\nfound in The Origin of the Work of Art.)\n\n\n\nOf course, these relationships with nature are still only part of\nwhat safeguarding involves. Its third and fourth dimensions demand that\nhuman beings await the divinities as divinities and \u201cinitiate\ntheir own essential being\u2014their being capable of death as death\u2014into the use and practice of this capacity, so that there may\nbe a good death\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking 352). The\nlatter demand suggests that we may safeguard each other as mortals by\nintegrating a non-evasive attitude to death (see above) into the\ncultural structures (e.g., the death-related customs and ceremonies) of\nthe community. But now what about the third dimension of safeguarding?\nWhat does it mean to await the divinities as\ndivinities?\n\n\nLet's again approach our question via a potential problem with\nHeidegger's account. Echoing a worry that attaches to the concept\nof heritage in Being and Time, it may seem that the notion of\ndestining, especially in its more specific manifestation as enframing,\ninvolves a kind of fatalism. Despite some apparent rhetoric to the\ncontrary, however, Heidegger's considered view is that destining\nis ultimately not a \u201cfate that compels\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). We have been granted the\nsaving power to transform our predicament. Moreover, the fact that\nwe are at a point of danger\u2014a point at which the grip of\ntechnological thinking has all but squeezed out access to the poetic\nand the mystical\u2014will have the effect of thrusting this saving\npower to the fore. This is the good news. The bad news is that:\n\n\nphilosophy will not be able to effect an immediate transformation of\nthe present condition of the world. This is not only true of\nphilosophy, but of all merely human thought and endeavor. Only a god\ncan save us. The sole possibility that is left for us is to prepare a\nsort of readiness, through thinking and poetizing, for the appearance\nof the god or for the absence of the god in the time of foundering\n[Untergang]; for in the face of the god who is absent, we\nfounder. (Only a God can Save Us\n107)\n\n\nThat is what it means to await the divinities as divinities.\n",
