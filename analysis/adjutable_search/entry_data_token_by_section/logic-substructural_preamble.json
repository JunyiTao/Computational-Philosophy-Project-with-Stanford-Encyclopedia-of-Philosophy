    "main_text": "\n\nSubstructural logics are non-classical logics weaker\nthan classical logic, notable for the absence of structural\nrules present in classical logic. These logics are motivated by\nconsiderations from philosophy (relevant logics), linguistics (the\nLambek calculus) and computing (linear logic). In addition, techniques\nfrom substructural logics are useful in the study of traditional\nlogics such as classical and intuitionistic logic. This article\nprovides a brief overview of the field of substructural logic. For a\nmore detailed introduction, complete with theorems, proofs and\nexamples, the reader can consult the books and articles in the\nBibliography.\n",
