    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Two Principles of Justice as Fairness\n4.3 The Two Principles of Justice as Fairness\n\nThese guiding ideas of justice as fairness are given institutional\nform by its two principles of justice:\n\n\nFirst Principle: Each person has the same\nindefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic\nliberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of\nliberties for all;\n\nSecond Principle: Social and economic inequalities\nare to satisfy two conditions:\n\nThey are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under\nconditions of fair equality of opportunity;\nThey are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged\nmembers of society (the difference principle) (JF,\n42\u201343).\n\n\n\nThe first principle of equal basic liberties is to be embodied in the\npolitical constitution, while the second principle applies primarily\nto laws governing economic institutions. Fulfillment of the first\nprinciple takes priority over fulfillment of the second principle, and\nwithin the second principle fair equality of opportunity takes\npriority over the difference principle.\n\nThe first principle affirms that all citizens should have the familiar\nbasic rights and liberties: liberty of conscience and freedom of\nassociation, freedom of speech and liberty of the person, the rights\nto vote, to hold public office, to be treated in accordance with the\nrule of law, and so on. The first principle accords these rights and\nliberties to all citizens equally. Unequal rights would not benefit\nthose who would get a lesser share of the rights, so justice requires\nequal rights for all, in all normal circumstances.\n\nRawls\u2019s first principle confirms widespread convictions about\nthe importance of equal basic rights and liberties. Two further\nfeatures make this principle distinctive. First is its priority: the\nbasic rights and liberties must not be traded off against other social\ngoods. The first principle disallows, for instance, a policy that\nwould give draft exemptions to college students on the grounds that\neducated civilians will increase economic productivity. The draft is a\ndrastic infringement on basic liberties, and if a draft is implemented\nthen all who are able to serve must be equally subject to it, even if\nthis means slower growth. Citizens\u2019 equal liberty must have\npriority over economic policy.\n\nThe second distinctive feature of Rawls\u2019s first principle is\nthat it requires fair value of the political liberties. The\npolitical liberties are a subset of the basic liberties, concerned\nwith the right to hold public office, the right to affect the outcome\nof national elections and so on. For these liberties, Rawls requires\nthat citizens should be not only formally but also substantively\nequal. That is, citizens who are similarly endowed and motivated\nshould have similar opportunities to hold office, to influence\nelections, and so on regardless of how rich or poor they are. This\nrequirement of the fair value of the political liberties has major\nimplications for how elections should be funded and run, as will be\ndiscussed below.\n\nRawls\u2019s second principle of justice has two parts. The first\npart, fair equality of opportunity, requires that citizens with the\nsame talents and willingness to use them have the same educational and\neconomic opportunities regardless of whether they were born rich or\npoor. \u201cIn all parts of society there are to be roughly the same\nprospects of culture and achievement for those similarly motivated and\nendowed\u201d (JF, p. 44).\n\nSo, for example, if we assume that natural endowments and the\nwillingness to use them are evenly distributed across children born\ninto different social classes, then within any type of occupation\n(generally specified) we should find that roughly one quarter of\npeople in that occupation were born into the top 25% of the income\ndistribution, one quarter were born into the second-highest 25% of the\nincome distribution, one quarter were born into the second-lowest 25%,\nand one-quarter were born into the lowest 25%. Since class of origin\nis a morally arbitrary fact about citizens, justice does not allow\nclass of origin to turn into unequal opportunities for education or\nmeaningful work.\n\nThe second part of the second principle is the difference principle,\nwhich regulates the distribution of wealth and income. Allowing\ninequalities of wealth and income can lead to a larger social product:\nhigher wages can cover the costs of training and education, for\nexample, and can provide incentives to fill jobs that are more in\ndemand. The difference principle allows inequalities of wealth and\nincome, so long as these will be to everyone\u2019s advantage, and\nspecifically to the advantage of those who will be worst off. The\ndifference principle requires, that is, that any economic inequalities\nbe to the greatest advantage of those who are advantaged least.\n\nTo illustrate, consider four hypothetical economic structures\nA\u2013D, and the lifetime-average levels of income that these\ndifferent economic structures would yield for representative members\nof three groups:\n\n\nEconomy\nLeast-Advantaged Group\nMiddle Group\nMost-Advantaged Group \n\nA\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000 \n\nB\n12,000\n30,000\n80,000 \n\nC\n30,000\n90,000\n150,000 \n\nD\n20,000\n100,000\n500,000 \n\n\nHere the difference principle selects Economy C, because it contains\nthe distribution where the least-advantaged group does best.\nInequalities in C are to everyone\u2019s advantage relative to a\ncompletely equal distribution (Economy A), and relative to a more\nequal distribution (Economy B). But the difference principle does not\nallow the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor (Economy D).\nThe difference principle embodies equality-based reciprocity: from an\negalitarian baseline, it requires that any inequalities are good for\nall, and especially for the worst-off.\n\nThe difference principle is partly based on the negative thesis that\nthe distribution of natural assets is undeserved. A citizen does not\nmerit more of the social product simply because she was lucky enough\nto be born with the potential to develop skills that are currently in\nhigh demand. Yet this does not mean that everyone must get the same\nshares. The fact that citizens have different talents and abilities\ncan be used to make everyone better off. In a society governed by the\ndifference principle, citizens regard the distribution of natural\nendowments as a common asset that can benefit all. Those better\nendowed are welcome to use their gifts to make themselves better off,\nso long as their doing so also contributes to the good of those less\nwell endowed.\n\nThe difference principle thus expresses a positive ideal, an ideal of\nsocial unity. In a society that satisfies the difference principle,\ncitizens know that their economy works to everyone\u2019s benefit,\nand that those who were lucky enough to be born with greater natural\npotential are not getting richer at the expense of those who were less\nfortunate. One might contrast Rawls\u2019s positive ideal to\nNozick\u2019s ideal of libertarian freedom, or to meritocratic ideas\nabout economic justice that are dominant within many democracies.\n\u201cIn justice as fairness,\u201d Rawls says, \u201cmen agree to\nshare one another\u2019s fate\u201d (TJ, 102).\n",
