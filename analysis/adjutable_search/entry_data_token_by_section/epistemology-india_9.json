    "main_text": "Analogy and Other Candidate Sources || Analogy and Similarity\n7.1 Analogy and Similarity\n\n\nBriefly we may consider the more exotic candidate sources proposed\nin the classical literature mainly within\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (often elaborated by\nVed\u0101ntins), beginning with analogy, which is viewed as the\npram\u0101\u1e47a for knowledge of similarity\nin M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta\nbut is rejected by the other schools, Vedic and non-Vedic alike, except\nfor Ny\u0101ya which however provides a radical reinterpretation. To\nprovide a hermeneutics of Vedic injunctions to make them suitable for\npractice in actual performances, the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 exegetes need to be\nable to designate substitutes, of one type of grain for another, for\nexample, or one animal for another, depending upon availability in the\nfirst place but upon similarity in the second place. In Ved\u0101nta,\nanalogy is useful for understanding the Upanishads which make\ncomparisons between spiritual or yogic experience and the experiences\nof ordinary humans, as pointed out by Kumar (1980: 110).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra, Jaina, and Ny\u0101ya logicians find similarity\u2014or\nrelevant similarity\u2014to figure in inference as a knowledge-generating\nprocess. It is through cognizing similarity and dissimilarity that we\narrive at knowledge of pervasion as required for inferential knowledge.\nA kitchen hearth counts as an \u201cexample\u201d in the stock inference because\nof its relevant similarity to the mountain which is the center of\ninquiry. It is part of what is called the\nsapak\u1e63a, the set of positive correlations,\nthat make us know an inference-underpinning pervasion. Knowledge of\nsimilarity is not viewed in Ny\u0101ya (or Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, etc.) as\nthe result of analogy as a knowledge source\u2014for Ny\u0101ya, analogy is\nrestricted to a subject\u2019s learning the meaning of a word (and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra does not countenance it as a separate\npram\u0101\u1e47a). But pervasion is known\ntypically through generalization from cases (although in some cases a single observation, some\nsay, will suffice), presupposing\nknowledge of relevant similarity which can be a matter of\nperception.\n\nVed\u0101nta and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nphilosophers, who take similarity to be a special object known through\nthis special source, give examples different from the stock scenario\nprovided by Gautama and elaborated by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.8) who limit the scope of\nanalogy to learning the meaning of a word. But for brevity\u2019s sake, let us\ntake up only the Ny\u0101ya theory. A subject S inquires of a forester\nabout a gavaya, which is a kind of buffalo, having heard the\nword \u2018gavaya\u2019 used among his schoolmates but not knowing what\nit means, i.e., not knowing what a gavaya is. Questioned by S,\nthe forester replies that a gavaya is like a cow mentioning\ncertain specifics as also some dissimilarities. To simplify, Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers say that the forester makes an analogical statement (\u201cA\ngavaya is like a cow\u201d), whereby our subject S now knows in\ngeneral (s\u0101m\u0101nyata\u1e25) what the\nword means, according to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba and\nfollowers (Tattva-cint\u0101-ma\u1e47i,\nanalogy chapter). But S does not yet know how it is used, does not know\nits reference, which is deemed a word\u2019s primary meaning. Later\nencountering a gavaya buffalo, S says, \u201cThis, which is similar\nto a cow, is the meaning of the word \u2018gavaya\u2019,\u201d a statement\nwhich expresses S\u2019s new analogical knowledge. The knowledge has been\ngenerated by analogy, its \u201cknowledge source,\u201d\npram\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nThe ontology of similarity is controversial. Several different theories\nare proposed, one of the best of which belongs to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, who sees it as a relational\nproperty supervening on other properties and defined as something\u2019s\nhaving a lot of the same properties as something else. It is not a\nuniversal, he argues, for similarity relates a correlate (the\ngavaya buffalo) and a countercorrelate (the cow), whereas a\nuniversal, in contrast, rests as a unity in, for example, with cowhood,\nall individual cows. In this way it is like contact, samyoga,\nbut there are also rather obvious differences. It is not reducible to\nany single category among the traditional seven (substance, quality,\nmotion, universal, individualizer, inherence, and absence), for some\nsubstances are like one another as are certain qualities and actions.\nBut similarity also is not, pace the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara, a\ncategory over and above the recognized seven.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s main argument there is\nthat similarity is not uniform. It is to an extent a property that is\nmind-imposed in that the counterpositive (the cow) is supplied from our\nside. Moreover, it supervenes on other properties.\n",
