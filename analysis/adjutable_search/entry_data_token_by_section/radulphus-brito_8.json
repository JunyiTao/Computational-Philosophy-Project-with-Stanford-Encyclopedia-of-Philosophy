    "main_text": "Psychology || Faculty Psychology\n5.3 Faculty Psychology\n\nBrito\u2019s explanation of why the animate body must be organic also\nshows clearly his commitment to a faculty psychology. He says:\n\n\nEvery form that has several capacities and operations [\u2026]\nrequires its subject to have multiple organs in order to perform those\noperations; the soul has several faculties and several operations;\ntherefore etc. [\u2026] [T]he vegetative faculty has the capacities\nof nutrition, growth, and generation; and these capacities have\ndifferent operations: the capacity of nutrition must preserve the\nsubstance of what is nourished; the capacity of growth must lead it to\na perfect quantity (ducere ad perfectam quantitatem), and the\ncapacity of generation must preserve the species. The sensitive soul\nalso has multiple capacities: the capacity of sight, of hearing, of\nsmell, etc., which have different operations. Also, the common sense\nhas several capacities, as imagination (potentia ymaginativa)\nand memory (potentia memorativa). Therefore, the soul\nrequires multiple organs in its body in order to perform those\noperations. Also, the intellectual soul insofar as it is intellectual\ndoes not have a bodily organ; however, its operation depends on some\nbodily power (virtus) that is in an organ, i.e., on the\nphantasia. (QDA-2012-II: 328\u2013329)\n\n\nConsequently, the parts of the organic body are the instruments for\nthe operations specifically performed by living beings; operations\nthat are divided into three different kinds: vegetative (bodily,\nnon-cognitive), sensitive (bodily, cognitive) and intellectual\n(non-bodily, cognitive). These operations must, then, correspond to\nthree specifically different faculties of the soul, which are\nresponsible for the actualization of the organic body\u2019s\npotential with regard to those operations (QDA-2012-II: 343\nand 345).\n",
