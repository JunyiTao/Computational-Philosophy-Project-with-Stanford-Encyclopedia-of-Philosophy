    "main_text": "LNC and the Buddhist Tetralemma\n5. LNC and the Buddhist Tetralemma\n\n\nBeyond the Western canon, the brunt of the battle over LNC has been\nlargely borne by the Buddhists, particularly in the exposition by\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna of the catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di or tetralemma (c. 200\nA.D.; cf. Bochenski 1961: Part VI, Raju 1954, Garfield 1995, Tillemans\n1999, Garfield & Priest 2002), also known as the four-cornered or\nfourfold negation. Consider the following four possible truth\noutcomes for any statement and its (apparent) contradictory:\n\n\n\n(9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\nS is P\n\n\n(ii)\nS is not P\n\n\n(iii)\nS is both P and not-P\n\n\n(iv)\nS is neither P nor not-P\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instances of the positive tetralemma, on N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\naccount, all four statement types can or must be accepted:\n\n Everything is real and not real.\n Both real and not real.\n Neither real nor not real.\n That is Lord Buddha's teaching.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014M\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101\n18:8, quoted in Garfield (1995: 102)\n \n\n\nSuch cases arise only when we are beyond the realm to which ordinary\nlogic applies, when \u201cthe sphere of thought has ceased.\u201d On\nthe other hand, more use is made of the negative tetralemma, in which\nall four of the statements in (9) can or must be rejected, and thus\none cannot assert either \u03a6, \u00ac\u03a6, both \u03a6 and \u00ac\u03a6, or\nneither \u03a6 nor \u00ac\u03a6. Is this tantamount, as it appears, to the\nrenunciation of LEM and LNC, the countenancing of both gaps and gluts,\nand thus\u2014in Aristotle's view\u2014the overthrow of all bounds\nof rational argument?\n\n\nIt should first be noted that the axiomatic status of LNC and LEM is\nas well-established within the logical traditions of India as it is\nfor the Greeks and their\n epigones.[7]\n Garfield (1995) and Tillemans (1999) convincingly refute\nthe claim that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was simply an  \n\u201cirrationalist\u201d.[8]\n In the first place, if N\u0101g\u0101rjuna simply rejected LNC, there\nwould be no possibility of reductio arguments, which hinge on\nthe establishment of untenable contradictions, yet such arguments are\nstandardly employed in his logic. In fact, he explicitly\nprohibits virodha (contradiction). Crucially, it is only in\nthe realm of the Absolute or Transcendent, where we are contemplating\nthe nature of the ultimate, that contradictions are embraced; in the\nrealm of ordinary reality, LNC operates and classical logic\nholds. (Recall Freud's dichotomy between the LNC-observant conscious\nmind and the LNC-free unconscious.)  In this sense, the logic of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna and of the Buddhist tradition more generally can\nbe seen not as inconsistent but paraconsistent. Indeed, just as\nAristotle ridiculed LNC-skeptical sophists as no better than\nvegetables (see \u00a71), the Buddhists dismissed the arch-skeptic\nSanjaya and his followers, who refused to commit themselves to a\ndefinite position on any issue, as\n\u201ceel-wrigglers\u201d (amar\u0101vikkhepa). Sanjaya\nhimself was notorious for his periodic lapses into the extended\nsilence Aristotle described as the last refuge of the LNC-skeptic (see\nRaju 1954).  \n\n\nOne aspect of the apparent paradox is precisely parallel to that\narising with some of the potential counterexamples to the LNC arising\nin Western thought. In various Buddhist and Jainist systems of\nthought, the apparent endorsement of Fa &\n\u00acFa (or, in propositional terms, \u03a6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03a6)\nis upon closer examination qualified in precisely the way foreseen by\nthe codicils in Aristotle's statement of the law: From a certain\nviewpoint, \u03a6 (e.g. Nirvana exists); from a certain viewpoint,\n\u00ac\u03a6 (e.g. Nirvana does not exist). (Compare the observation of\nJainists two millennia ago that \u201cS is P\u201d\nand \u201cS is not\nP\u201d can both be true from different standpoints; cf. Raju\n1954: 698\u2013701; Balcerowicz 2003.)\n\n\nTo further explore the status of truth-value gluts, in which both\nclassical values are simultaneously assigned to a given proposition\n(e.g. \u201cx is real\u201d), let us consider the analogous\ncases involving gaps. Recall, for example, the case of future\ncontingents as in (2a,b) above: we need not maintain that \u201cIraq\nwill become a secular democracy\u201d is neither true nor false when\nuttered today, but only that neither this statement nor its\ncontradictory \u201cIraq will not become a secular democracy\u201d is\nassertable today in the absence of foreknowledge. Similarly\nfor past unknowables, such as (to adapt an example from Quine) the\nproposition that the number of blades of grass on the Old Campus lawn\nduring the 2005 Yale commencement exercises was odd. This is again\nmore plausibly viewed as unassertable than as truth-valueless, even\nthough its truth-value will never be known. To take a third example,\nwe can argue, with Grice (1989: 80ff.), that a negation outside the\nscope of a conditional is generally intended as a refusal (or\nhesitation) to assert \u201cif p then q\u201d\nrather than as the contradictory negation of a conditional, whose\ntruth value is determined in accord with the standard material\nequivalence:\n\n(10) \u00ac(p\u2192q) \u2261 (p &\n\u00acq)\n\n\nThus, in denying your conditional \u201cIf you give her penicillin,\nshe will get better\u201d, I am allowing for the possibility that\ngiving her penicillin might have no effect on her, but I am not\npredicting that you will administer the penicillin and she will fail\nto recover. Nor does denying the apothegm (typically though\ninaccurately attributed to Dostoyevsky or Nietzsche) that if God is\ndead everything is permitted commit one to the conjoined proposition\nthat God is dead and something is forbidden. As Dummett (1973: 328\u201330)\nputs the point, we must distinguish negation outside the scope of a\nFregean assertion operator, not\n (\u22a2p),\n from the assertion of a negative proposition,\n \u22a2(not p).\n The former interpretation \u201cmight be taken to be a means of\nexpressing an unwillingness to assert\u201d p, in particular\nwhen p is a conditional:\n\n\n\n(11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X:\nIf it rains, the match will be canceled.\n\n\nY:\nThat's not so. (or, I don't think that's the case.)\n\n\n\n\nY's contribution here does not constitute a negation of\nX's content; rather, we can paraphrase Y as\nconveying (11\u2032a) or (11\u2032b):\n\n(11\u2032a) If it rains, the match won't necessarily be canceled.\n\n(11\u2032b) It may [epistemic] happen that it rains and yet\nthe match is not canceled.\n\n\nDummett observes, \u201cWe have no negation of the conditional of\nnatural language, that is, no negation of its sense: we have only a\nform for expressing refusal to assent to its assertion.\u201d\n\n\nSimilarly with disjunction. Consider the exchange in (12) preceding\nthe 2000 election, updated from an example of Grice:\n\n\n\n(12)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0X:\nBush or Gore will be elected.\n\n\nY:\nThat's not so: Bush or Gore or Nader will be elected.\n\n\n\n\nY's rejoinder cannot be a contradictory of the content of\nX's claim, since the (de jure) election of Bush rendered both\nX's and Y's statements true. Rather, Y\nobjects on the grounds that X is not in an epistemic position\nto assert the binary disjunction.\n\n\nUnassertability can be read as the key to the apparent paradox of the\ncatu\u1e63ko\u1e6di as well. The venerable text in\nMajjhima-nik\u0101ya 72, relating the teachings of the\nhistorical Buddha, offers a precursor for N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's\ndoctrine of the negative tetralemma. Gotama is responding to a monk's\nquestion concerning the doctrine of rebirth (quoted in Robinson 1967:\n54):\n\n Gotama, where is the monk reborn whose mind is thus freed?\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is\n reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is not\n reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is both reborn and not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is both\n reborn and not reborn.\n Then, Gotama, he is neither reborn nor not reborn.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is neither\n reborn nor not reborn.\n\n\n\nNote the form of the translation here, or similarly that of the\nstandard rendering of the negative catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di that \u201cit\nprofits not\u201d to assert \u03a6, to assert \u00ac\u03a6, to assert\nboth \u03a6 and \u00ac\u03a6, or to assert neither \u03a6 nor \u00ac\u03a6:\nthe relevant negation can be taken to operate over an implicit modal,\nin particular an epistemic or assertability operator. If so, neither\nLEM nor LNC is directly at stake in the tetralemma: you can have your\nAristotle and Buddha too.\n\n\nWe tend to recalibrate apparent violations of LNC as conforming to a\nversion of the law that incorporates the Aristotelian qualifications:\na sincere defense of \u201cp and not-p\u201d\nplausibly involves a change in the context of evaluation or a shift in\nviewpoint, or alternatively a suppression of modal or epistemic\noperators. This practice can be seen as an instance of a general\nmethodological principle associated with\n Davidson\n and Quine that has come to be called the principle of\ncharity (or, alternately, the principle of rational\naccommodation): when it is unclear how to interpret another's\nargument, interpret it in a way that makes the most sense. At the same\ntime, this procedure evokes the standard Gricean mode of explanation\n (Grice 1989; see the entry on\n   implicature):\ngranted the operation of the Cooperative Principle and, more broadly,\nthe shared premise of rationality, we reinterpret apparent violations of\nvalid principles or maxims so as to conserve the assumption that one's\ninterlocutor is a rational and cooperative agent. And as Aristotle would\nremind us, no principle is more worthy of conservation than the Law of\nNon-Contradiction.\n6. Vagueness and borderline contradictions\n\n\nWe have seen that two of the more significant threats to the\nunchallengeable status of LNC tend to dissolve under closer scrutiny.\nHeraclitus-type contradictions (Sea water is healthy and sea water\nis not healthy) are rendered LNC-compatible by the Aristotelian\nrider designed for that purpose (\u201ca is F\u201d and\n\u201ca is not F\u201d cannot both hold in the same\nsense, at the same time, and in the same respect) once the\n\u201cdropped qualification\u201d or contextual specification is\nrestored (\u00a74). Buddhist-type contradictions (Nirvana exists\nand Nirvana does not exist) can be understood as modalized,\nembedded under an epistemic modal or assertability operator.\n\n\nWe are left with two significant challenges for LNC: (i) the case of\nthe Liar and related paradoxes of self-reference as touched on in\n\u00a73 and work cited therein (see the entries on Liar Paradox,\nRussell\u2019s Paradox, Dialetheism, Paraconsistent Logic) and (ii)\nthe case of vagueness and its implications for borderline truth,\ndiscussed in this section. As we have seen, the admission of\ntruth-value gaps (exceptions to LEM) is mirrored by the admission of\ntruth-value gluts (exceptions to LNC). As intellectual heirs of the\nHegelian tradition, Marxists have willing to accept paradox, and\nindeed the pre-Revolutionary theorist Plekanov (1909) suggests that\nSorites (in the form of the bald man; see sorites entry) can be\nresolved by rejecting LNC. Hyde (1997) traces the history of\nvagueness-based arguments for paraconsistency from Plekhanov through\nJa\u015bkowski, McGill, and Parry in the 1940s to the dialetheist\nlogics of today. Pointing out the parallels between treatments of\nvagueness via truth-value gap theories (including the supervaluation\ntheory of van Fraassen 1969) and their truth-value glut counterparts,\nHyde laments the unwarranted neglect of the latter option: \u201cThe\nthought that an adequate response might require the recognition of\ncases of overdetermination and and truth-value gluts has few\nsupporters\u201d (Hyde 1997: 641). In the two decades since the\npublication of his important paper, that neglect has been largely\nrectified, especially with the accretion of empirical support for\nglut-oriented approaches endorsing the acceptability of a range of\ntrue contradictions of the form a is P and a is not P, in\nparticular when P is a vague predicate like tall, vague,\nor red.\n\nSupervaluation theory utilizes the concept of admissible sharpening or\nprecisification of vague predication (see  the entry on\n vagueness). I may be unable to assert\n truthfully of a given color\nchip in the red-orange range that it is red, while also being unable\nto assert that it is not red. Once the notion of red is sharpened or\nprecisified to a particular interval of wave-lengths, I am in a\nposition to assert either the positive proposition \u201ca is\nred\u201d or its negation \u201ca is not red\u201d, but which one\ndepends on the details of the sharpening. A sentence S is\nsupertrue iff it is true on every sharpening and superfalse if it is\nfalse on every sharpening; if is true on some sharpenings and false on\nothers, it is neither supertrue nor superfalse, thus corresponding to\na truth-value gap. One salutary result of this approach is that LEM\ncan be retained: P or not P is supertrue since it is true on\nevery sharpening. Hyde (1997) draws on the dual status of gaps and\ngluts to define a paraconsistent \u201csubvaluation\u201d theory:\nS is subtrue iff is true on at least one sharpening, subfalse\niff it is false on at least one sharpening, and neither subtrue nor\nsubfalse if it is true on some sharpenings and false on others. Given\nthe status of supervaluation and subvaluation as duals, each is equally\ndefensible and applicable to the semantics of vagueness. \nCrucially, it is the notion of supertruth, or subtruth as the case may\nbe, that tracks our natural language intuitions of truth, and similarly\nfor falsity. In this sense, the logic of supervaluation is\nparacomplete (allowing for violations of LEM) and the logic of\nsubvaluation paraconsistent (allowing for violations of LNC). In the\ntradition of paraconsistent logics, Hyde stresses the need for\n\u201cquarantining the gluts\u201d to avoid the explosive\nconsequences of ex contradictione quodlibet (see \u00a74).\n\n\nWhere supervaluation theory allows a is not\ntall or a is not bald to be neither (super)true nor\n(super)false if a represents a borderline instance of tallness,\nsubvaluation theory would characterize such an assessment as both\n(sub)true and (sub)false. But since tautologies are preserved if\nvalidity is defined in terms of truth and not subtruth (or\nsupertruth)\u2014an assumption that some might challenge\u2014a\nis tall and a is not tall can never be true, even when a is\ntall and a is not tall are both true:\n\nA vague\nsentence \u2018A\u2019 and its negation might both be true\n(since they each have some true disambiguation\u2014i.e. the sentence\n\u2018A\u2019 itself as some true and some false\ndisambiguation\u2014but their conjunction can never be.\n\u2018A & \u00acA\u2019 has only false disambiguations;\nLNC is retained. (Hyde 1997: 654)\n\n\nFor Akiba (1999), however, paraconsistent subvaluation theories,\nlike paracomplete supervaluation theories, should be recast in a modal\nlight, by supplying an epistemic possibility operator Pos in the former\ncase (reminiscent of the modalized accounts of the tetralemma explored in\n\u00a75) and its dual, an abstract modal concept Akiba defines as\nDef (corresponding to necessary truth) in the latter. \nThus, while P & \u00acP remains a full-fledged\ncontradiction, its modalized counterpart Pos(P) &\nPos(\u00acP) is coherent, and while P v \u00acP is a valid\ninstance of LEM, Def(P) v Def(\u00acP) is not:\n\u201cSuper- and subvaluation systems can be considered not really\nalternatives to classical logic but in fact just modal extensions of\nit.\u201d Akiba\u2019s key departure from Hyde\u2019s approach is in\nrejecting the move to identify truth simpliciter with subtruth\n(or supertruth). \n\n\nConfronted with the task of applying semantically vague predicates\nlike tall and red to borderline cases, the intuitions\nof respondents in psycholinguistic studies often tend to become\nuncertain. Subjects produce varying responses for the crucial\ndata, and the framers of the studies have produces varying explanations\nfor the data. In one of the earlier studies, Bonini et al. point to the\nasymmetries in judgments of truth and falsity for borderline cases of\na is red/tall and ultimately reject truth-gap and truth-glut\naccounts in favor of an LEM- and LNC-compatible epistemic theory of\n\u201cvagueness as ignorance\u201d. That is, the subject S\n\u201cmentally represents vague predicates in the same way as other\npredicates with sharp true/false boundaries of whose location\nS is uncertain\u201d (Bonini et al. 1999: 387). \n\n\nKyburg (2000) offers a pragmatic explanation for why a is\ntall might be judged neither true nor false in a case of\nborderline tallness, or why a is tall and a is not tall might\nbe judged true in the same circumstance. Without conceding gaps\nor gluts, she points to a disconnect between truth-value intuitions and\nassertability intuitions for a cooperative speaker aiming to be\nmaximally informative. Of course, in some cases, the felicity of a\nis tall and a isn\u2019t tall might simply reflect the awareness\nthat different cut-off points apply depending on the relevant\ncomparative class of entities (children vs. adults, male adults vs.\nmale professional basketball players, etc.)\u2014the instances\nforeseen by the Aristotelian rider. But in other cases, such a\nstatement would indeed convey that a possesses a borderline degree of\ntallness, while simply affirming or denying the vague\npredicate\u2014a is tall or a is not\ntall\u2014would communicate too high or too low a degree. Just as\nspeakers might a sentence might refrain from uttering, or classifying\nas true, a perfectly and \u201csharply\u201d true sentence whose use\nwould mislead the hearer\u2014Snow is white or snow is\npurple\u2014so too the assertion of a conjunction of opposites in\nborderline cases\u2014a is tall and he\u2019s not\ntall\u2014might be preferred, despite its contradictory nature,\nto the misleading assertion of either a is tall or a is not\ntall in the same circumstance.\n\n\nFor Sorensen (2001), an individual\u2019s acceptance of the truth\nof certain false claims, including those necessarily false claims of\nthe form a is tall and a is not tall, reflect not the\ninadequacy of our semantic and logical analyses but the tendency for\nspeakers to be wrong, confused, or ignorant about the truth conditions\nof given sentences or about their own beliefs, especially those\ninvolving vagueness, similarly to the way in which perceptions can\nmislead in the case of visual illusions.\n\n\nThe vagueness-as-ignorance theory of Bonini et al. (1999), the modal\ntheory of Akiba (1999), the assertability theory of Kyburg (2000), and\nthe error theory of Sorensen (2001) are all semantically classical in\ntheir preservation of LNC (along with LEM and bivalence). In essence,\neach of these approaches to the assessment of vague predications\nreflects a wariness about jettisoning the classical account of truth\nand contradiction in favor of an approach endorsing either\nsupervaluations (and gaps) or subvaluations (and gluts). Despite the\ndifficulties posed by vagueness, these theorists would thus adopt the\nphilosophical corollary to the familiar legal adage: \u201cHard cases\nmake bad laws.\u201d\n\n\nIn two recent papers the reconciliatory approach is rejected in\nfavor of defenses of paraconsistency, although not precisely along the\nlines laid out by Hyde. On Hyde\u2019s account, a is tall and\na is not tall can both be true when a is\nborderline tall (say, 5\u203211\u2033) while the full or reduced conjunction of\nthese statements, a is tall and (a is) not tall, will be\nfalse, given the standard supervaluationist approach. Alxatib &\nPelletier, however, find the opposite judgments among a majority of the\nsubjects of their study, who accept the conjunction while rejecting the\nindividual ascriptions of truth. In addition to reinforcing the view of\ngappy and glutty theories as mirror images, Alxatib & Pelletier\npresent their results as evidence against the neo-classical\nvagueness-as-ignorance position of Bonini et al. (1999), a position\nwhich also has difficulty accounting for the paucity of subjects\nchoosing the \u201ccan\u2019t tell\u201d option in the surveys. Like\nthe assertability-based pragmatic theory of borderline contradictions\nproposed by Kyburg, Alxatib & Pelletier (2011: 321) offer a Gricean\nexplanation for subjects\u2019 endorsement of the truth of apparent\ncontradictory statements\u2014a is tall and not tall when a\nis just short of 6 feet tall\u2014which yields (in just this case) a\nsubvaluationary interpretation on which the speaker is taken to convey\nthe borderline status of a\u2019s height. Their central\nfinding (2011: 298\u20139) is that theories admitting truth-value gaps like\nthat of Hyde (1997) or the paraconsistent logic of Priest 2006 fare\nbetter in accounting for the full range of interesting data presented\nin their experiments\u2014and those of Ripley 2011. \n\nLike Alxatib & Pelletier, Ripley (2011: \u00a72) conducts his own\nsurvey of reactions to apparent contradictions involving vague\npredications (e.g., \u201cThe circle is both is and isn\u2019t near\nthe square\u201d; \u201cThe circle neither is nor isn\u2019t near\nthe square\u201d). He leverages the results of his study to argue\nagainst error (or epistemic) theories on which borderline\ncontradictions are always false even when believed true; he also\nrefutes fuzzy theories of vagueness, which fail to predict why\nsubjects are so willing to accept the truth of borderline\ncontradictions rather than assigning them an intermediate\nacceptability ranking.  Ripley also finds pragmatic or contextualist\ntheories not insufficiently fleshed out to yield the correct\npredictions. He adopts a dialetheist account that enables him to line\nup with a majority of his subjects in finding both \u201ca\nis F and a is not F\u201d and \u201ca is\nneither F nor not F\u201d true for borderline\napplications of F.  Supporting this view, he notes (2011:\n186\u20137) that there may be variation with respect to the \u201ccultural\naversion to contradictions\u201d; there is evidence tending to\nsuggest that Asian subjects are less likely than Westerners\n(specifically, as it happens, Canadians) to object to contradictions\nlike \u201cIt\u2019s raining and it\u2019s not raining.\u201d But as Ripley\nconcedes, more research is needed on this point.\n7. Contradiction in everyday life\n\n\nThe logical incoherence of contradictions is the ground both for\nindecision (as with Zerlina\u2019s ambivalent Vorrei e non\nvorrei in our epigraph) and for the pragmatic exploitation of\napparent contradictions for communicative ends. One locus is the\noxymoron, a phrasal contradiction recognized for millennia as a figure\nof speech. The dramatic effect of yoking contradictories is as old as\nthe classical festina lente (\u2018make haste slowly\u2019,\nadopted as a motto by Augustine and the Medicis. The German\ncounterpart, deployed by Goethe and others, adds rhyme: Eile mit\nWeile.\n\n\nThe use of actual or apparent contradiction to generate meanings via\nreconstrual may convey advice to seek the middle way, reminiscent of\nthe function of borderline contradictions surveyed in \u00a76, or may,\nin the case of an apparently incoherent phrasal structure, serve as a\nsignal that the modifier constrains the denotation of the head. Thus\nbittersweet is not taken as self-contradictory property, while\na tragicomedy is a work or production that spans the two\nnormally opposed genres\u2014recall Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cI am\nlarge; I contain multitudes\u201d. Classic oxymorons include cruel\nkindness, living death, and true lies; jocular\nones are regularly proposed, from military intelligence and\ncongressional ethics to airplane food and open\nsecrets. A particularly transparent form is offered by those\npromoting undesign design or the non-concept\nconcept.\n\n\nThe oxymoron, and in particular the catalogue of oxymorons, may\nsignal the breakdown of logical coherence, given the explosive effect\nof ex contradictione quodlibet. In Romeo and Juliet,\nwe ascend from the former\u2019s risible inventory of battling\nbinaries to the latter\u2019s ardent valediction on her balcony:\n\n\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\n\nO anything, of nothing first create!\n\nO heavy lightness! Serious vanity!\n\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\n\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Romeo and Juliet, I.i\n\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\n\nThat I should say good night till it be morrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Romeo and Juliet, II.ii\n\n\n\nExpanding from the phrasal to the sentential level, we find\nself-contradictory propositions, whether in full or elliptical form,\nfunctioning in forums from high culture to social media to generate a\nvariety of implicatures. In her recent study of the phenomenology of\nambivalence, Razinsky takes the affirmation of conjoined\ncontradictories \u201ca is v and a is not v\u201d\nfor a given value judgment v, or the affirmation of \u201ca\nis v and a is v\u00b4\u201d where v,\nv\u00b4 are contraries (e.g. a is good and a is\nbad), to be \u201ccentral to the logic of value and of\nvalue judgment\u201d (2017: 229). Some apparent instances of\nambivalence (and of any underlying violation of LNC) can be explained\naway. Citing Mill, Razinsky (2017: 201) accepts that there are\ninstances in which a is just and a is unjust reflects only an\napparent opposition, to be understood essentially as a is just in\nsome respects and a is unjust in other respects. Such cases\nillustrate the prescience of the Aristotelian rider: \u201ca is\nF\u201d and \u201ca is not F\u201d cannot both\nhold in the same sense, at the same time, and in the same\nrespect. Similarly, the imposition of the edict a\nought to F and a ought not to F results in difficulty for the\nunfortunate a, to be sure, but not necessarily in an LNC\nviolation, given the availability of distinct sources of obligation.\nBut other cases involve true ambivalence: \u201cMeaningful\ncontradictions are moored in the possibility of conceptual\nambivalence\u201d (Razinsky 2017: 44). The analysis of such cases must\npreserve the dynamic tension in affirming that a is v and a is\nnot-v and at the same time acknowledge the speaker\u2019s\nawareness of the violation of LNC, not an easy task: \u201cDo people\nbelieve contradictions when it comes to value? I do not think there is\na good answer to give here\u201d (Razinsky 2017: 228)\u2014they\nbelieve them and do not believe them.\n\n\nPerhaps as a reflection of this tension, the A-not-A meme has widely\nproliferated in popular entertainment, advertisements, and social\nmedia. \u201cSorry not sorry\u201d has become a standard device for\na sarcastic or insincere apology (also known as a \u201cnon-apology\napology\u201d), while #SorryNotSorry is a trending Twitter hashtag as\nwell as a Demi Lovato song title (see Carey 2014 in Other Internet\nResources). A related meme is \u201cI\u2019m not saying, I\u2019m just\nsaying\u201d, a now notorious \u201cget out of jail free\u201d\ndiscourse ploy showing up in hundreds of google hits, as the subject\nof an urbandictionary entry and several online commentaries by\nlinguists, and as the title of a 2012 flash fiction paperback by\nMatthew Salesses.  The category of \u201cChristmas-not-Christmas\nmovies\u201d makes its perennial appearance on the web during holiday\nseason, and the #worknotwork has been adopted as the house meme of\nSamsonite luggage.\n  #GuiltyNotGuilty\nis another popular hashtag as well as a theme for Gucci ads.\n\n\nA relatively new means for expressing ambivalence in colloquial U.S.\nand Australian English is the \u201cYeah no\u201d (or, less\nfrequently, \u201cNo yeah\u201d) response, which has been analyzed as\nconveying a variety of possible discourse functions (see Burridge &\nFlorey 2002, Lee-Goldman 2011, and Liberman 2008 in Other Internet\nResources).\n\n\nThe conjunction of contradictory predicates of the form not A\nand/but not NOT A is used to indicate the borderline status of an\nentity with respect to a category and its complement:\n \n\nThey not brown but they not NOT brown.\n[Saturday Night Live (faux commercial \nLevi\u2019s Wokes),\n Nov. 30, 2017]\nKarl Mitze, Geoff Manyin, Nick Montopoli, and Zachariah Matteson\nredefine what it means to be a string quartet.

No. Are they even in the middle, like not\nhealthy but not not healthy?\nNo.\n [Creme de la Crumb recipe column]\n\n\n\nWhile these appear fully contradictory, that diagnosis relies on the\nstatus of S is not not P as an instance of \u00ac(\u00ac(S is\nP)) within a logic employing a robust Law of Double Negation. Arguably,\nhowever, in each of these attestations, the inner\nnegation\u2014not brown, not punk, not healthy, and even\nnot-raining\u2014can be viewed as a coerced or virtual\ncontrary, in which case the two negations do not fully cancel out.\nThus, just as not impossible fails to reduce to possible,\nnot not classical is distinct from classical, and no\nactual violation of LNC is ultimately condoned. But, as on\nGrice\u2019s (1989) analysis of irony and tautology, it is the\nrecognition of the apparent contradiction that the speaker exploits to\ngenerate the higher-order coherence of the message.\n\n\nA less, or perhaps differently, mediated case of coherence in\napparent contradictories involves prosody. In this case, the\nhearer/reader seems to have to reconcile LNC with the joint predication\nof A and not A rather than the more complex not A\nand not not A. But on closer examination, the task is less\ndaunting than it appears, as it\u2019s really a matter of affirming\nA while rejecting A, or of\nmetalinguistically rejecting A in favor of\nA:\n\nAfter playing a staggering 40,000 minutes (in just 11\nseasons) and carrying four straight Finals teams, LeBron [James] might\nbe battling the long-term effects of a historically ridiculous two-way\nburden.

Get\nit?)\n [https://tinyurl.com/y8656rqy,\n of Jon Snow on Game of Thrones]\n\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the role contradiction plays as a lively\nsource of ironic humor, especially for the highbrow reader. In one\n New Yorker cartoon \n(Benjamin Schwartz, March 30, 2015), a veterinarian comes into the\nwaiting room, places a comforting arm on the worried man\u2019s\nshoulder, and breaks the news: \u201cAbout your cat, Mr.\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2014I have good news and bad news.\u201d (See\n\u00a74 above for more on the poor cat\u2019s indeterminate\nprognosis.)
