    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u00c9milie le Tonnelier de Breteuil, marquise Du\nCh\u00e2telet-Lomont\u2014or simply \u00c9milie Du \nCh\u00e2telet\u2014was born in Paris on 17 December 1706 to baron Louis Nicholas\nle Tonnelier de Breteuil and Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de\nBreteuil. She married Marquis Florent-Claude de Ch\u00e2telet-Lomont\nin 1725. Together they had three children, a daughter and two sons\n(the second died the year after his birth). In 1733, she met Voltaire\nwho became her lover and life-long intellectual companion. They\nretired to Du Ch\u00e2telet's husband's\nestate\u2014Cirey\u2014which was remodeled to include a laboratory\nwith several instruments for their on-going scientific experiments. In\n1748, she became pregnant at the age of 42 with the child of her then\nlover, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert. She bore her fourth\nchild, a daughter, on 4 September 1749 and died on 10 September\n1749.\n\n\nIn her intellectual work, Du Ch\u00e2telet focused on natural\nphilosophy, particularly that of Newton, Leibniz and Christian Wolff.\nShe knew, corresponded with, or was tutored by Pierre Louis de\nMaupertuis, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, Samuel Koenig, and several members\nof the Bernoulli family, and her advanced abilities in physics and\nmathematics made her especially able to write capably about\nNewton's physics. She thus contributed to the shift in France\naway from an acceptance of Cartesian physics and toward the embrace of\nNewtonian physics. Nonetheless, she was more than just an expositor of\nothers' works, and she was not interested in physics alone.\nIndeed, still squarely in the tradition of natural philosophy, Du\nCh\u00e2telet sought a metaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics\nshe embraced upon rejecting Cartesianism.\n\n\nVoltaire implicitly acknowledged her significant\ncontribution\u2014especially on more technical material\u2014to his\n1738 El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton. For many\nyears, it was believed that there was one surviving chapter from an\notherwise lost work written by Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2014her\n\u201cEssai sur l'optique\u201d (ca. 1736). This chapter is housed\namong Voltaire's papers in Russia's National Library in\nSt. Petersberg. Judging from that chapter on color formation this\nearlier essay seems to have been a more developed version of the\nchapter on optics in Voltaire's book, thus indicating her significant\ncontribution to Voltaire's work. As a fascinating side note on how\ndynamic Du Ch\u00e2telet studies are, in recent years fully three\ncomplete copies of her Essai have been found, one in\nBernoulli's papers in Basel (Nagel 2012) and two that have been\nacquired recently by the Mus\u00e9e des lettres et manuscrits in\nParis. In 1737 Du Ch\u00e2telet entered a competition to explain the\nnature of fire, conducting her experiments in secret while Voltaire\nalso conducted experiments for his entry to the competition. Both Du\nCh\u00e2telet's and Voltaire's entries aimed to disprove the theory\nthat fire is a material substance, and both were published along with\nthe three winners (including the essay essay by Leonhard Euler, which\ntook the top prize). Du Ch\u00e2telet returned to this project a\nnumber of times thereafter, making significant revisions to the\noriginal text as her ideas on the nature of fire matured and\nchanged.\n\n\nIn 1738, she published \u201cLettre sur les\n\u2018El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de\nNewton\u2019\u201d in the Journal des savants in which\nshe argued against those who accepted a Cartesian account of\nattraction. In 1740 she published her Institutions de\nphysique (The Foundations of Physics) ostensibly a\ntextbook in physics for her son, but in reality a highly original work\nin natural philosophy (a second edition was published in 1742 under\nthe slightly altered title Institutions physique). It was in\nthis text\u2014her magnum opus\u2014that she supplied the\nmetaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics she had long\naccepted. This metaphysics was Leibnizian and Wolffian in flavor. Her\ninclusion of a defense of force vive (she thus sided with\nLeibniz on this question) led to her subsequent dispute on the issue\nwith Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan. Sometime in the early 1740s she\nbegan work on her two-volume translation of and commentary on Newton's\nPrincipia. She died shortly after she completed this work,\nwhich remained unpublished until 1759. It is still the leading French\ntranslation of Newton's book.\n\n\nWhile Du Ch\u00e2telet's primary interest was in natural\nphilosophy, she also had interests in ethics (translating of portions\nof Mandeville's Fable of the Bees), theology and the\nBible (writing a book titled Examens de la\nBible), and the source of human happiness\n(writing a semi-autobiographical book, Discours sur le\nbonheur). Her non-scientific work occasionally touched on the\nsubject of women's social roles and their education.\n\n\nThis entry focuses on Du Ch\u00e2telet's natural philosophy,\nwhich occupied the bulk of her intellectual efforts. More specifically,\nit focuses on that aspect of her thought as found in her own clearly\narticulated version of natural philosophy\u2014her masterwork of\n1740, The Foundations of Physics.\n",
