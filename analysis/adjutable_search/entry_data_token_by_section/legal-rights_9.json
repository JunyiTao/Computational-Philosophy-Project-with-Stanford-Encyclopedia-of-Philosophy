    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Function and Value || The Demand Theory\n4.3 The Demand Theory\n\nFocusing on claim-rights, Joel Feinberg and Stephen Darwall are the\nmost prominent defenders of a third theory of the function of rights\nsometimes referred to as a \u201cdemand theory of\nrights\u201d\u2014emphasizing the capacity or power of right-holders\nto claim or demand. (Feinberg 1970; 1980: 130\u2013158; 1992: 155;\nDarwall 2006: 18\u201319; 2007: 60\u201365; 2010; 2011; see also\nSkorupski 2010: 310\u2013311; Gilbert 2018). Imagine a legal system\ncomprising just and reasonable duties to respect and safeguard others.\nYet, these duties are public duties not owed to those individuals that\nthey are designed to benefit. It is, therefore, a legal system of just\nduties without correlative rights (at least non held by individual\nbeneficiaries). Feinberg finds such law morally wanting. In a world\nwithout rights no one is legally owed justice, benevolence,\nor care, and, therefore, no one is in a position to claim or demand\njust treatment under the law. Accordingly, the unique moral function\nof legal rights for right-holders is not to secure them just treatment\nas such, but to provide them with claims for such treatment. Feinberg\nfinds this function morally precious, even in a world of benevolent\nand law-abiding people who act justly towards others regardless of\nwhether they owe it to them or not. For Feinberg, holding claims is\nintimately related to human dignity, as it engages people\u2019s\nagency and capacity to make claims and provides them with a sense of\nself-worth as creatures who are not only recipients of moral regard,\nbut are also owed it (Feinberg 1970: 252). \n",
