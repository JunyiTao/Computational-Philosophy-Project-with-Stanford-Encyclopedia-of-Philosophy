    "main_text": "Confucianism || The Conceptual Background to Confucianism in Korea\n3.1 The Conceptual Background to Confucianism in Korea\n\nThe next philosophical tradition we will consider is Confucianism, which was gradually transmitted from Han China as part of the cultural package during the earliest kingdoms in Korea. The Classical Confucianism of Pre-Qin and Han dynasties massively contributed to the Korean culture, society and literature but philosophically and politically it was Neo-Confucianism which arose much later in the medieval Song-Ming-Yuan dynasties that influenced Korea most. Confucius was no doubt the founder of Confucianism with the central concept of benevolence (\u4ec1) but traditionally Koreans enthusiastically subscribed to the Mencius\u2019 idea of moral foundations in good human nature (in particular the idea of Four Sprouts, i.e., the heart/mind of sympathy, the heart/mind of shame, the heart/mind of deference, and the heart/mind of right/wrong; see Mengzi  2A:6) and also the practical/metaphysical ramification and development of these ideas in Neo-Confucianism in China. Also important for the rise of the Korean Neo-Confucianism was Koreans\u2019 perception about their existential weakness and limitedness vis-\u00e0-vis the world\u2019s moral evil along the path of self-cultivation, and they subjected the emotional aspects of this vulnerability and its resolution to sharp analyses and unusual recipes for self-improvement.\n\nOne of the most important conceptual and ontological frameworks found in Korean Neo-Confucianism is the paired concepts of Essence (ch\u2019e) and Function (yong.) As in the Buddhist tradition, the Essence-Function structure permeates the entire view of reality among Korean Neo-Confucians when they connect the inner structure of phenomena with its external expressions. Thus, for those Neo-Confucians, all things, processes, and complexes in the universe can be considered in terms of two aspects, i.e., Essence and Function. Just as in Buddhism, \u201cEssence\u201d refers to the underlying structure of something that provides the ground or pattern for its activities or changes within the world. \u201cFunction\u201d then refers to what is manifested by what is hidden or invisible. Neo-Confucians applied the Essence-Function paradigm to the most important parts of their philosophical edifice, i.e., cosmology, moral psychology, the process of self-cultivation in sage learning, etc. It is important to keep in mind that \u201cEssence (ch\u2019e \u9ad4)\u201d, which literally means \u201cbody\u201d, does not refer to a reified entity, as in the Western metaphysical concept of substance. \u201cEssence\u201d and \u201cFunction\u201d refer to two different ways or aspects of what is fundamentally one and the same. In this sense, the Essence of something is not separate from its Function. They mutually embrace each other in a seamless way. But there is definitely an order or hierarchy between them. Essence is always thought to take precedence over Function. In this sense, it is prior to, or more fundamental than, Function. Neo-Confucianism, for example, repeatedly emphasizes that human nature (s\u014fng \u6027) in its unaroused state (mibal \u672a\u767c), i.e., before entering into the realm of activity, is the Essence, and the feelings expressed in everyday life are its Function. In this context, \u201cEssence\u201d refers to the heart/mind of the sage (sometimes called \u201ctosim (C. daoxin, the heart/mind of the Dao)\u201d, and Function to the behavior of an ordinary person or insim (C. renxin, the heart/mind of an ordinary person). The idea then is that what is underlying as a fundamental principle can be pulled in all directions in the manifest world. There is no doubt that this Essence-Function paradigm is importantly related to what is known as \u201cCorrelative Thinking\u201d, according to which the world is an interconnected web where everything or every phenomenon is situated in a dynamic cycle of relations both productive and anti-productive to some others (Needham 1954).\n\nNeo-Confucians also took up the Buddhists concepts of noumena-phenomena (i-sa) and transformed it into the i-ki \u7406\u6c23 (Principle and Vital Force) framework, which is then used to explicate the nature (s\u014fng \u6027) and feelings (\u60c5) of human beings. It is in Chos\u014fn Korea where the most advanced discussion of the relationship between the original human nature and the emotions took place in the form of the so-called \u201cFour-Seven Debate\u201d (see below), and it is the originator of the Four-Seven Debate, Yi Hwang \u674e\u6ec9 (1501\u20131570 pen name: T\u2019oegye \u9000\u6eaa), who provides what is probably the most detailed examination of the Essence-Function paradigm in the entire East Asian tradition (Muller forthcoming). \n\nBefore we go on, a brief explanation of Principle (\u7406) and Vital Force (\u6c23) is in order. First, Principle refers to the universal order of the world and, for this reason, it is the intangible and abstract yet active and dynamic source of all things. It is not only the principle of being of all things in the world but also their normative source, i.e., the source of good in the world. Thus, Principle is good intrinsically yet also transcendentally, going well beyond the confines of the manifested, phenomenal world. What is more, human nature is none other than this very same Principle concretely exemplified in humans. So, in this respect, human nature is innately good. A person has a heart/mind (sim, C. xin \u5fc3) whose nature (\u6027) is endowed by Heaven. Since human nature is nothing other than Principle, which is in the heart/mind of a person, the heart/mind must innately point to Principle. Note that Principle itself does not move but it sets the limits on what can move in the phenomenal world. This is because Principle itself is the organizing source of reality that, while not visible, provides the structure and pattern for all phenomena. When the fullness of Principle as the fountainhead of all beings is brought to relief, Principle is called \u201cSupreme Ultimate (t\u2019aeg\u016dk, C. taiji \u592a\u6975)\u201d. Supreme Ultimate thus refers to the ultimate metaphysical ground of the development of things in the world, which it generates by way of its polarity (i.e., yin and yang forces).\n\nOn the other hand, Vital Force (gi, C. qi \u6c23) is a psycho-physical force or energy that can serve as the vehicle of Principle. As concretizing force, it is the primordial stuff out of which everything in the universe is made. Following Zhu Xi in Song China, the Neo-Confucians at the time typically believed that Principle can manifest itself in the world only by means of Vital Force. When Principle is manifested in the spatiotemporal world by Vital Force, it becomes material (chil \u8cea). The material then refers to the state of Vital Force\u2019s becoming thick and dense. Thus, Principle is the same everywhere but Vital Force is exemplified in different modes or qualities. For example, Vital Force freely moves when it is refined, but it is inert when it is coarse.\n",
