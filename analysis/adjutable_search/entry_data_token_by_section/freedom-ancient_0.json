    "main_text": "Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism\n1. Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism\n\nIn the ancient world, a number of arguments were put forward that\nproceed from the Principle of Bivalence, a basic principle in logic,\nin order to establish fatalism\u2014where \u201cfatalism\u201d is\nthe view that the future is inevitable and we are powerless to do\nanything to shape it. Most prominently, these arguments are presented\nin chapter 9 of On Interpretation, Aristotle\u2019s treatise\non semantics, and in Cicero\u2019s On Fate, which discusses\nthe \u201cLazy Argument\u201d. The \u201cMaster Argument\u201d, a\nsimilar argument for the necessity of the future that was taken to\nhave fatalist implications, is both put forward and endorsed by\nDiodorus Cronus (died c. 284 BCE). These arguments differ in their\ndetails, but in broad strokes here is how they all proceed.\n(Henceforward, \u201cthe fatalist argument\u201d refers to this\ngeneral argument.)\n\nThe Principle of Bivalence (PB) states that every statement has\nexactly one truth value: either true, or false. And because PB does\napply to every statement, it applies also to statements about what\nwill occur in the future. (The example Aristotle gives is \u201cthere\nwill be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d, while in On Fate Cicero\ntalks about \u201cyou will recover from this illness\u201d.) So for\nany pair of contradictory statements about the future\u2014such as\n\u201cyou will recover from this illness\u201d and \u201cyou will\nnot recover from this illness\u201d\u2014exactly one of them is\ntrue, and has been true from eternity (Fat. 29, LS 55S; see the\n Bibliography for abbreviations used).\n But if it is true from eternity that an event will occur, then that\nevent is necessary (Fat. 21, LS 38G). Since PB applies to\nevery statement about what might occur in the future, every future\nevent is necessary. (This is why, in the context of contemporary\ndiscussions of fatalist arguments that proceed from PB, PB is\nsometimes referred to as \u201clogical determinism\u201d.) However,\nbecause there is no point in deliberating about what is necessary\n(Int. 9 18b31\u201336), there is no point in deliberating about\nanything in the future. As Aristotle puts it, if the fatalist argument\ngoes through, \n\n\nthere would be no need to deliberate or to take trouble (thinking that\nif we do this, this will happen, but if we do not it will not). For\nthere is nothing to prevent someone\u2019s having said ten thousand\nyears beforehand that this would be the case, and another\u2019s\nhaving denied it; so that whichever of the two was true to say then,\nwill be the case of necessity. (Int. 9 18b31\u201336) \n\n\nAristotle makes it clear that it does not matter whether people\nactually made such predictions; what matters is that one of the\nuttered statements would have been true. Or as Cicero says, if it has\nbeen true from eternity that you will recover from an\nillness, then there would be no point in trying to bring about the recovery,\nsince it will happen no matter what you do (Fat. 28, LS\n55S).\n\nWhy believe the argument\u2019s premise that, if a statement has been\ntrue from eternity, then the event that it predicts is necessary? One\ncommon reason is the immutability of the past, that we cannot now do\nanything to change the past. This immutability is the reason the Stoic\nChrysippus gives (against Cleanthes, who preceded him as head of the\nStoa) for why the past is necessary (Fat. 14, LS 38E). And if\nthe past is necessary, it might seem to follow that I cannot now do\nanything to change the past truth of statements about the future.\nAristotle thinks that the present is also necessary, saying\n\u201cWhat is, necessarily is, when it is; and what is not,\nnecessarily is not, when it is not\u201d (Int.\n19a23\u20135). After all, if I am presently bleeding from a wound,\nwhile it might be possible for me either to bleed to death or not, and\nI might do something to make it the case that I don\u2019t bleed to\ndeath, I cannot do anything to change the fact that I am bleeding\nright now. But then, the present truth of a statement about what will\nresult from my wound may also seem to make the outcome necessary, as\nmuch as the past truth would.\n\nIn connection with this argument, \u201cnecessary\u201d does not\nmean metaphysically necessary, causally necessary, or logically\nnecessary. Instead, things that are necessary are inevitable or beyond\nour power to affect. Aristotle gives mathematical truths, celestial\nmotions and the past as examples of things we do not bother\ndeliberating about. Aristotle, Epicurus, the academic skeptic\nCarneades, and the Stoic Chrysippus all wish to reject the conclusion\nof the fatalist argument, but they have different responses to the\nargument based on their views about whether the Principle of Bivalence\nis compatible with effective deliberation. After Aristotle, they\nalso consider whether causal determinism is compatible with effective\ndeliberation.\n",
