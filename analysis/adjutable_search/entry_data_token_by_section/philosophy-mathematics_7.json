    "main_text": "Platonism || G\u00f6del\u2019s Platonism\n3.1 G\u00f6del\u2019s Platonism\n\nG\u00f6del was a platonist with respect to mathematical objects and\nwith respect to mathematical concepts (G\u00f6del 1944; G\u00f6del\n1964). But his platonistic view was more sophisticated than that of\nthe mathematician in the street.\n\nG\u00f6del held that there is a strong parallelism between plausible\ntheories of mathematical objects and concepts on the one hand, and\nplausible theories of physical objects and properties on the other\nhand. Like physical objects and properties, mathematical objects and\nconcepts are not constructed by humans. Like physical objects and\nproperties, mathematical objects and concepts are not reducible to\nmental entities. Mathematical objects and concepts are as objective as\nphysical objects and properties. Mathematical objects and concepts\nare, like physical objects and properties, postulated in order to\nobtain a good satisfactory theory of our experience. Indeed, in a way\nthat is analogous to our perceptual relation to physical objects and\nproperties, through mathematical intuition we stand in a\nquasi-perceptual relation with mathematical objects and concepts. Our\nperception of physical objects and concepts is fallible and can be\ncorrected. In the same way, mathematical intuition is not fool-proof\n\u2014 as the history of Frege\u2019s Basic Law V shows\u2014 but\nit can be trained and improved. Unlike physical objects and\nproperties, mathematical objects do not exist in space and time, and\nmathematical concepts are not instantiated in space or time.\n\nOur mathematical intuition provides intrinsic evidence for\nmathematical principles. Virtually all of our mathematical knowledge\ncan be deduced from the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with\nthe Axiom of Choice (ZFC). In G\u00f6del\u2019s view, we have\ncompelling intrinsic evidence for the truth of these axioms. But he\nalso worried that mathematical intuition might not be strong enough to\nprovide compelling evidence for axioms that significantly exceed the\nstrength of ZFC.\n\nAside from intrinsic evidence, it is in G\u00f6del\u2019s view also\npossible to obtain extrinsic evidence for mathematical\nprinciples. If mathematical principles are successful, then, even if\nwe are unable to obtain intuitive evidence for them, they may be\nregarded as probably true. G\u00f6del says that:\n\n\u2026 success here means fruitfulness in consequences, particularly\nin \u2018verifiable\u2019 consequences, i.e. consequences verifiable\nwithout the new axiom, whose proof with the help of the new axiom,\nhowever, are considerably simpler and easier to discover, and which\nmake it possible to contract into one proof many different proofs\n[\u2026] There might exist axioms so abundant in their verifiable\nconsequences, shedding so much light on a whole field, yielding such\npowerful methods for solving problems [\u2026] that, no matter\nwhether or not they are intrinsically necessary, they would have to be\naccepted at least in the same sense as any well-established physical\ntheory. (G\u00f6del 1947, p. 477)\n\n\nThis inspired G\u00f6del to search for new axioms which can be\nextrinsically motivated and which can decide questions such as the\ncontinuum hypothesis which are highly independent of ZFC (cf.\n section 5.1).\n\nG\u00f6del shared Hilbert\u2019s conviction that all mathematical\nquestions have definite answers. But platonism in the philosophy of\nmathematics should not be taken to be ipso facto committed to holding\nthat all set-theoretical propositions have determinate truth values.\nThere are versions of platonism that maintain, for instance, that all\ntheorems of ZFC are made true by determinate set-theoretical facts,\nbut that there are no set-theoretical facts that make certain\nstatements that are highly independent of ZFC truth-determinate. It\nseems that the famous set theorist Paul Cohen held some such view\n(Cohen 1971).\n",
