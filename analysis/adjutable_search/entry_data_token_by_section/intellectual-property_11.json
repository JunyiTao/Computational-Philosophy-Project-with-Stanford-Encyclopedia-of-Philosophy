    "main_text": "Justifications and Critiques || The Utilitarian Incentives-Based Argument for Intellectual Property\n3.2 The Utilitarian Incentives-Based Argument for Intellectual Property\n\nIn terms of \u201cjustification,\u201d modern Anglo-American systems\nof intellectual property are typically modeled as incentive-based and\nutilitarian (Oppenheim 1951; Machlup 1962; Boonin 1989; Hettinger\n1989; Mackaay 1990; Coskery 1993; Palmer 1997; Moore 2001, Lemley\n2015). On this view, a necessary condition for promoting the creation\nof valuable intellectual works is granting limited rights of ownership\nto authors and inventors. Absent certain guarantees, authors and\ninventors might not engage in producing intellectual property.\nAlthough success is not ensured by granting these rights, failure is\ninevitable if those who incur no investment costs can seize and\nreproduce the intellectual effort of others. Adopting systems of\nprotection like copyright, patent, and trade secret yields an optimal\namount of intellectual works being produced, and a corresponding\noptimal amount of social utility. Coupled with the theoretical claim\nthat society ought to maximize social utility, we arrive at a simple\nyet powerful argument for the protection of intellectual property\nrights.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the issue of whether intellectual property\nprotection does, or does not, sufficiently promote human happiness or\nwell-being is an empirical question. Whether or not, for example,\nintellectual property protection provides an incentive that elicits\nsome optimal output of content creation can be settled only by looking\nto the empirical evidence. Likewise, whether or not intellectual\nproperty protection has the effect of hindering innovation and\ninhibiting the production of novel valuable content can be settled\nonly by empirical analysis. The difficulties involved in obtaining\nsuch evidence suggest that the empirical question will remain debated\nfor some time. Complicating the task is the fact that the efficacy or\nlack thereof of intellectual protection in promoting well-being seems\nto vary from one industry to the next (Lemley 2015).\n\nOn the positive side there are numerous authors who claim that the\nempirical evidence is now squarely in favor of intellectual property\nprotection. The tragedy of a \u2018no-protection rule\u2019 is\nsecrecy, restricted markets, and lost opportunities (Miners &\nStaff 1990; Mossoff 2015; O\u2019Connor 2016). William Fisher\nnotes:\n\nPotential innovators will know that, once they reveal their\nbreakthroughs to the world, other people will be able to take\nadvantage of them for free. Consequently, the innovators will be\nunable to recoup the costs of their innovations (the costs of the\neducation they underwent to prepare them to make the innovations, the\noutlay for research and development, their opportunity costs, etc.).\nAware of this risk, potential innovators will devote their energies to\nother, more lucrative activities, and society at large will suffer.\n(Fisher 2001)\n\n\nRobert J. Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin note that over the long run\nthe world\u2019s growth rate is largely:\n\ndriven by discoveries in the technologically leading economies.\nFollowers converge at least part way toward the leaders because\ncopying is cheaper than innovation over some range. As the pool of\nuncopied ideas diminishes, the cost of imitation tends to\nincrease\u2026the consequence from the absence of intellectual\nproperty rights across economies\u2026[is] the leading places tend\nto have insufficient incentive to invent, and the follower places tend\nto have excessive incentive to copy. (Barro & Sala-I-Martin 1997)\n\n\nProfessor Petra Moser makes the following observation:\n\nIn countries without patent laws, inventors depend entirely on\nsecrecy, lead-time, and other alternatives to patents in protecting\ntheir intellectual property. As a result, investments in research and\ndevelopment may be most attractive in industries in which secrecy can\neffectively guarantee exclusive rights long enough to allow inventors\nto recoup their investments. (Moser 2013)\n\n\nWhile much of the economic literature in this area focuses on patents,\nsimilar points can be made with respect to copyright. With the ease of\ncopying and distribution afforded by modern digital networks, content\ncreators would seem to be at a serious disadvantage compared to\ncopiers. Without copyright there would be nothing to stop copiers\nfrom simply copying movies, books, articles, and music and selling,\ntrading, or allowing others to make free copies. Michael Smith\nand Rahul Telang, argue that piracy harms both producers and consumers\nby undermining the income streams of producers, resulting in less\ncontent being created (Smith & Telang 2016). Sean\nO\u2019Connor notes, \u201cit should be clear that no one would\ninvest without some appropriation mechanism that would provide them\nwith a favorable return on their investment through the monetization\nof the commercialized goods or services. If they cannot see a way to\nget such a return, they will not make the\ninvestment\u201d (O\u2019Connor 2015).\n3.2.2 Problems for the Utilitarian Incentives-Based Argument\n\nOn the negative side there are many who argue that \u201cthe jury is\nout\u201d or that systems of IP protection actually hinder innovative\nactivity (Machlup 1958; Schiff 1971; Palmer 1990; Boldrin & Levine\n2007). On patent protection, Fritz Machlup (1958) wrote \u201cNo\neconomist, on the basis of present knowledge, could possibly state\nwith certainty that the patent system, as it now operates, confers a\nnet benefit or a net loss upon society\u201d (Machlup 1958).\nNevertheless, Machlup went on to argue that such considerations do not\nyield the conclusion that we should abolish patent protection.\nProfessors Michele Boldrin and David Levine argue that a \u2018first\nmover advantage,\u2019 coupled with secrecy and add-on services, is\nsufficient as an incentive for creation and discovery (Boldrin &\nLevine 2007). Tom Palmer made a similar point seventeen years earlier,\narguing that intellectual works should be protected via technological\nfences and contracts, along with bundling in other products and\nservices (Palmer 1990).\n\nGiven that the utilitarian argument rests on providing incentives,\nwhat is needed to critique it are cases that illustrate better ways,\nor equally good ways, of stimulating production without granting\nprivate property rights to authors and inventors. It would be better\nto establish equally powerful incentives for the production of\nintellectual property that did not also require initial restricted use\nguaranteed by rights (Polanyi 1943; Machlup 1962; Hettinger 1989;\nWaldron 1993; Moore 2003; Wright 1998).\n\nOne alternative to granting intellectual property rights to inventors\nas incentive is government support of intellectual labor (Hettinger\n1989; Calandrillo 1998). This could take the form of government-funded\nresearch projects, with the results immediately becoming public\nproperty. The question becomes: can government support of intellectual\nlabor provide enough incentive to authors and inventors so that an\nequal or greater amount of intellectual products are created compared\nto what is produced by conferring limited property rights? Better\nresults may also be had if fewer intellectual works of higher quality\nwere distributed to more people.\n\nUnlike a government-supported system of intellectual property rights,\nreward models may be able to avoid the problems of allowing monopoly\ncontrol and restricting access, and at the same time provide\nincentives to innovate (Shavell and Van Ypersele 2001). In this model,\ninnovators would still burn the midnight oil chasing that pot of gold,\nand governments would not have to decide which projects to fund or\ndetermine the amount of the rewards before the works\u2019\n\u201csocial value\u201d was known. Funds necessary to pay the\nrewards could be drawn from taxes or collecting percentages of the\nprofits of these innovations. Reward models may also avoid the\ndisadvantages of monopoly pricing, and obstructions to further\nadaptation and innovation.\n\nTrade secret protection appears to be the most troubling from a\nutilitarian incentives-based perspective (Hettinger 1989). Given that\nno disclosure is necessary for trade secret protection, promoting\ntrade secrets through incentives yields no reciprocal long-term social\nbenefit. Trade secret protection allows authors and inventors the\nright to slow the dissemination of protected information\nindefinitely\u2014a trade secret necessarily requires secrecy.\n3.2.3 The Utilitarian Rejoinder\n\nThe utilitarian who defends the incentives argument may well agree\nwith many of these criticisms and still maintain that intellectual\nproperty rights, in some form, are justified\u2014the current system\nof protection is better than government support of intellectual\nproperty creation, reward models, or nothing at all. Additionally,\nmost of the worries surrounding the incentive-based approach appear to\nfocus on problems of implementation. We could tinker with our system\nof intellectual property, cutting back on some legal protections and\nstrengthening others (Coskery 1993; Moore 2008). Perhaps we could\ninclude more personality-based restrictions on what can be done with\nan intangible work after the first sale, limit the term of copyrights,\npatents, and trade secrets to something more reasonable, and find ways\nto embrace technologies that promote access while protecting\nincentives to innovate. The utilitarian might also remind us of the\ncosts of changing our system of intellectual property. The \u2018jury\nmay be out\u2019 so-to-speak regarding the economic advantages of legal\nprotections for intellectual works, but the social and economic costs\nof radically changing these institutions at this point would be overly\nburdensome.\n",
