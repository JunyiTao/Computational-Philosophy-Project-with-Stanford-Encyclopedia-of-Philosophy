Who are his philosophers?\n\n\nThe abundance of Hebrew terms in Ibn Ezra\u2019s writings that may refer to\n\u201cphilosophers\u201d or \u201cphilosophy\u201d\u2014none of\nthem very precise, some of them perhaps coined by Ibn Ezra\nitself\u2014afford an additional perspective upon the peculiar nature\nof Ibn Ezra\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d. The Hebrew homonyms for\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cphilosophers\u201d (which entered\nthe language by way of the Arabic) never appear in the biblical\ncommentaries. In the single instance cited in Klatzkin\u2019s Lexicon, Ibn\nEzra is reported to have used the word in the restricted sense of\nastronomers, in a manner similar to that of his predecessor Abraham\nbar Hiyya (whose astronomical writings he studied closely). This is\nnot necessarily the case; in the single instance cited by Klatzkin,\nfilosofim is appears in apposition to hakhamim, an\nall-purpose word meaning scholar or master of any of the seven or ten\n sciences.[3]\n Nonetheless, it does seem clear that Ibn Ezra has no concept of\nfalsafa in the sense that it was used in Arabic philosophy,\nthat is, in the restricted sense of Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions.\n\n\nThe term shiqqul ha-da\u2018at (rational analysis,\nliterally, \u201cweighing [in the balance of] reason\u201d) is used\nin the broad sense of reason or rationality. In the introduction to\nhis commentary to the Torah, Ibn Ezra writes: \u201crational analysis\n(shiqqul ha-da\u2018at) is the foundation, because the Torah\nwas not given to those devoid of reason; and the go-between\n(mal\u2019akh, \u2018angel\u2019 or\n\u2018messenger\u2019) between man and his God is his\nintellect.\u201d Soon after (gloss to Genesis 1:2) the same term is\nused in what could again be taken as a strictly astronomical or\nscientific context: \u201cPeople who employ rational analysis have\nsure proofs that there is only one earth.\u201d Ibn Ezra was far\nbetter grounded in the exact sciences than he was in philosophy, and\nthis fact is reflected in his usage of filosofim\nand shiqqul ha-da\u2018at.\n\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to narrow the sense of terms used by Ibn\nEzra. An example is \u201cthe scholars who [base their claims upon]\nproofs\u201d (hakhmei ha-ra\u2019ayot), which is found in\nan excursus upon psychology, which we shall scrutinize below. Joseph\nIbn Aqnin employs a very similar expression: \u201clogicians, who\nadduce proofs (ra\u2019ayot) to strengthen the Islamic\nreligion, and the Ishmaelites call them\n mutakallim\u016bn \n [kalamists].\u201d[4]\n Given Ibn Ezra\u2019s attachments to kalam, some of which have already\nbeen noted, it seems clear that the term in question here, and perhaps\nothers as well, refers to the doctors of the kalam.  References here\nand elsewhere to logic and proofs thus stand, in fact, for\ndisputations that are carried out on a rational basis, but not\nnecessary by the rules of Aristotelian logic.\n\n\nAnother term employed by Ibn Ezra is hakhemei (or:\nanshei) ha-mehqar, literally \u201cscholars\u201d (or:\npeople of inquiry).  Bar Hiyya uses the term hakhemei\nha-mehqar in the sense of philosophers: \u201cthe form\nconcerning which the hakhemei ha-mehqar said that it is\nneither body nor attached to a\n body.\u201d[5]\n\nTushiyya is yet another term. In one place Ibn Ezra contrasts\nthe views of the people of mehqar with those of the people of\ntushiyya, in a way that suggests that the former are\nmutakallim\u016bn and the latter f\u00e2lasifa.\nIn his gloss to Psalms 104:30 he notes: \u201cThe people of\nmehqar say that every living being will rise after his death;\nthe people of tushiyya say that the universals are preserved,\nbut individuals perish.\u201d The choice of this term clearly derives\nfrom Sa\u2019adiah\u2019s translation of tushiyya (Job 26:3) as\nfalsafa. However, this usage is neither statistically significant nor\ntotally consistent.\n\n\nIbn Ezra notes (gloss to Eccelsiastes 7:9; see below) that one must\nread \u201cmany books\u201d in order to master psychology, but he\ndoes not name a single one of them; this observation as well holds\nthroughout his opus, where, to the best of my knowledge, not a single\ntextbook on psychology, metaphysics, or logic is ever mentioned by\nname. However, formal study of scientific texts was only one means of\naccess to the philosophy of the day. By the late eleventh century\nAndalusian Jewry had drunk deeply from the fountain of Greco-Arabic\nscience, and Ibn Ezra could certainly have achieved some familiarity\nwith psychology and other fields without having undergone any formal\ncourse of study. As we shall see, Ibn Ezra certainly read Ibn\nS\u00een\u00e2\u2019s philosophical allegory, Hayy bin\nYaqz\u00e2n.  In general, it would seem that he was attracted to\nshort, tantalizing and cryptic expositions, rather than lengthy,\ndiscursive prose.\n",
