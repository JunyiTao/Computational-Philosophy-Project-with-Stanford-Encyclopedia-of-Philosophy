    "main_text": "Motivating and Explanatory Reasons || Explanatory Reasons\n4. Conclusion\n\nSpace limitations preclude detailed examination of other debates about\npractical reasons. We shall close the entry with a\nbrief description of a relatively new debate about reasons for action\nthat derives from work in the social sciences. The debate relates to\nwork in experimental psychology (some of it dating from the 1970s,\ne.g., Nisbett and Wilson 1977) that claims to identify our \u201creal\nreasons\u201d for acting. Briefly, experiments have shown that\nfactors such as the way items are presented in a situation of choice\ninfluence people\u2019s choices without their being aware of this\ninfluence. For example, in some of these experiments, when faced with\na choice among what in fact are identical options, agents tend to\nchoose the item on the right. This appears to be in fact the result of\na right-hand bias in most humans. However, since people are not aware\nof this bias, when asked to justify their choice, agents cite reasons\nconcerning some alleged superior feature of their chosen option. These\nand other phenomena, such as implicit bias (which occurs when agents\ndisplay bias based on race, gender, etc. in their behaviour, while\nexplicitly denying that they endorse such bias) and others, seem to show that agents\nare motivated by reasons they are not aware of, and in ways that they are not aware of, even\nafter careful reflection on their reasons and motivations. The general\nclaim, then, is that these phenomena undermine many of our ordinary\nand philosophical assumptions about our reasons for acting, for they\nshow, it is said, that agents are often ignorant of their real reasons\nfor acting, and as a result they often \u201cconfabulate\u201d when\nexplaining and attempting to justify their behaviour (see Hirstein\n2009). These conclusions, if right, would appear to threaten\nfundamentally the authority we seem to enjoy about our own reasons for\nacting, as well as the explanatory power of the ordinary explanations\nof action that cite the agent\u2019s reasons for acting.\n\nThe plausibility of these conclusions depends to a large extent on\nwhether the notion of \u201cthe agent\u2019s real reason\u201d that\nthese studies claim to uncover is the same as the notion of a\nmotivating reason that has been examined in this entry. One suggestion\nmight be that these so-called \u201creal reasons\u201d are\nexplanatory but not motivating reasons. And, it has been argued that,\nwhile these explanatory reasons might make important contributions to\nexplaining our actions, in a variety of ways, this fact is compatible\nwith our ordinary psychological explanations in terms of agents\u2019\nmotivating reasons. For instance, it may be that the sorts of reasons\nuncovered by these experiments help explain why agents are motivated\nby the reasons that they avow are their reasons for acting: the\nprevalence of a right-hand bias in most humans may explain why the\nitem on the right seems more appealing to an agent. But this is\nconsistent with the truth of the agent\u2019s claim that her reason\nfor choosing the item is the (putative) fact that it is better than the other items\n(see Sandis 2015 for\nsuggestions along these lines).\n \nThe above is an overview of a range of\nproblems about practical reasons and their widespread significance. It\nshould be sufficient to show how the problems and their many\nramifications reach into many aspects of our lives and have important\nconsequences for our understanding of ourselves as rational\nagents.\n",
