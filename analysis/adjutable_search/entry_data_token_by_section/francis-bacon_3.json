This meager result stimulated his ambition\nto establish a new system of the sciences. This tendency can already be\nseen in his early manuscripts, but is also apparent in his first major\nbook, The Advancement of Learning. In this work Bacon presents\na systematic survey of the extant realms of knowledge, combined with\nmeticulous descriptions of deficiencies, leading to his new\nclassification of knowledge. In The Advancement (Bacon III\n[1887], 282f.) a new function is given to philosophia prima,\nthe necessity of which he had indicated in the Novum Organum,\nI, Aphorisms LXXIX\u2013LXXX (Bacon IV [1901], 78\u20139). In both\ntexts this function is attributed to philosophia naturalis,\nthe basis for his concept of the unity of the sciences and thus of\nmaterialism.\n\n\nNatural science is divided by Bacon into physics and metaphysics.\nThe former investigates variable and particular causes, the latter\nreflects on general and constant ones, for which the term form\nis used. Forms are more general than the four Aristotelian\ncauses and that is why Bacon's discussion of the forms of\nsubstances as the most general properties of matter is the last step\nfor the human mind when investigating nature. Metaphysics is distinct\nfrom philosophia prima. The latter marks the position in the\nsystem where general categories of a general theory of science are\ntreated as (1) universal categories of thought, (2) relevant for all\ndisciplines. Final causes are discredited, since they lead to\ndifficulties in science and tempt us to amalgamate theological and\nteleological points of doctrine. At the summit of Bacon's pyramid\nof knowledge are the laws of nature (the most general principles). At\nits base the pyramid starts with observations, moves on to invariant\nrelations and then to more inclusive correlations until it reaches the\nstage of forms. The process of generalization ascends from natural\nhistory via physics towards metaphysics, whereas accidental\ncorrelations and relations are eliminated by the method of exclusion.\nIt must be emphasized that metaphysics has a special meaning\nfor Bacon. This concept (1) excludes the infinity of individual\nexperience by generalization with a teleological focus and (2) opens\nour mind to generate more possibilities for the efficient application\nof general laws.\n",
