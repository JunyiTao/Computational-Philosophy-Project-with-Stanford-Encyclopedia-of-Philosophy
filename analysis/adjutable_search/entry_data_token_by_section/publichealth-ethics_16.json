    "main_text": "Political legitimacy and Public Health || Alternatives to Liberalism\n3.5 Frameworks that Include both Justice and Legitimacy Considerations\n\nAs we noted in the introduction to this entry, many real-world\nchallenges in public health require attending to both questions of\njustice as well as questions of legitimacy in order to provide an\nadequate analysis of what is morally at stake. In keeping with this\nobservation, some have proposed approaches to public health ethics\nthat accord normative importance to individual liberty while also\nallowing for the possibility that, depending on the context, other\nmoral considerations may justifiably outweigh or override this\nnormative\n importance.[30]\n Several influential frameworks for public ethics that are meant to\nprovide practical guidance to public health professionals who wish to\nconsider ethical issues in their decision-making are structured around\nthis view (Kass 2002; Childress et al. 2002; Marckmann et al. 2015;\nPetrini 2010; ten Have et al. 2010). A common thread in these\napproaches is an endorsement of something like principlism developed\nby Tom Beauchamp and James Childress in their influential work on\nbiomedical ethics (Beauchamp and Childress 2019). Ethical\ndecision-making is understood to require the balancing or weighing of\ndifferent moral considerations whose relative relevance or importance\ncan only be discerned in the context of a specific policy or\naction.\n\nIn addition to concerns about legitimacy, individual liberty and\nautonomy, justice, overall benefit and efficiency, these models\ngenerally include other substantive moral considerations such as\nexpressing solidarity, building trust, and giving reasons to the\npublic (Childress et al. 2002) as well as procedural conditions to\nhelp guarantee a fair decision process (Marckmann, et al. 2015;\nBernstein et al. 2020).\n\nEach of these substantive moral considerations can provide a prima\nfacie justification for implementing or rejecting a policy. However,\nwhen these considerations conflict, we must assess their relative\nimportance for the public health policy at issue. Ultimately, both\npublic health ethicists and public health decision-makers need to\nemploy considerable practical judgment to weigh these different kinds\nof considerations in a particular public\nhealth context to determine what policy, if any, ought to be\nimplemented.\n",
