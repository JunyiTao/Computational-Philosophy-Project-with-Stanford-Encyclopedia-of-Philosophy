    "main_text": "Hypothetical theories of ability || The conditional analysis\n3.1 The conditional analysis\n\nThe most prominent hypothetical theory of ability is what has come to\nbe called the \u2018conditional analysis\u2019. In this section, we\nwill survey that form of analysis, the problems for it, and\nalternatives to it that are supposed to overcome those problems.\n\nThe conditional analysis of ability has at least two aspects. First,\nS has an ability to A just in case a certain\nconditional is true of her. Second, that conditional has the following\nform: S would A if S were to have a certain\nvolition. The precise form such an analysis will take will depend on,\nfirst, how we interpret this conditional and, second, which volition\nfigures in the antecedent.\n\nIt has been standard in the literature, when this first question has\nbeen raised, to understand the conditional as a subjunctive\nconditional (Ginet 1980), and we will assume in what follows that this\nis the best form of the conditional analysis. There has been some\ndisagreement about whether it is a might or a would\nconditional that is relevant (for an account of this distinction, see\nLewis 1973, 21\u201324), as well as about which volition is relevant.\nIn the following, we will take the relevant conditional to be a\nwould conditional, and the relevant volition to be\ntrying, though nothing will hang on these selections, and the\npoints to be raised would apply also to other forms of conditional\nanalysis, mutatis mutandis.\n\nWe thus arrive at the following form of the conditional analysis:\n\n(CA)\nS has the ability to A iff S would\nA if S tried to A.\n\n\nIf (CA) were true, it would constitute a theory of ability in that it\nwould say under exactly what conditions some agent has the ability to\nperform some action without making reference to the idea of ability\nitself. (Note that a variant on (CA) that is sometimes discussed,\naccording to which S has the ability to A iff\nS could A if S tried to\nA, would not meet this standard, since the\n\u2018could\u2019 seems to make a claim about S\u2019s\nabilities. So such a view is not really a conditional\nanalysis. Indeed, it is not even clear that it involves a\ngenuine conditional, for reasons discussed in Austin 1970\n(211\u2013213).\n\nThe conditional analysis so understood has been subject to a fair\namount of criticism, which will be reviewed in the following section.\nIt bears noting, however, just how apt an account of ability it seems\nat first pass. It satisfies, at least at first approximation, the\nextensional constraints: there are many actions with respect to which\na typical agent satisfies the relevant conditional, and also many\nactions with respect to which she does not, and these roughly\ncorrespond to her abilities. This imposes a demand even on those who\nwish to reject (CA), namely to explain why, if (CA) is simply\nfalse, it so closely approximates to the truth about abilities.\n\nIts approximate satisfaction of the extensional constraints is also\nplausibly a reason why something like (CA) has found so many\nthoughtful advocates. It is at least strongly suggested, for example,\nby the following remarks from Hume\u2019s Enquiry:\n\nFor what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We\ncannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives,\ninclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a\ncertain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no\ninference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For\nthese are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we\ncan only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the\ndeterminations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,\nwe may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical\nliberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a\nprisoner and in chains. (8.1; Hume 1748, 72)\n\n\nOf course, Hume and many of those who have followed him have been\nattempting to do something rather more than to offer a theory\nof ability. Hume\u2019s intent was to show that disputes over\n\u2018question of liberty and necessity, the most contentious\nquestion of metaphysics\u2019 have been \u2018merely verbal\u2019\n(8.1; Hume 1748, 72). Whatever we may think of this striking claim,\nhowever, there is a dialectical gap between it and the alleged truth\nof (CA). To anticipate a theme that will be central in what follows,\nwe must be careful to distinguish between, on the one hand, the\nadequacy of various views of ability and, on the other, the more\ncontentious metaphysical questions about freedom to which they are\ndoubtlessly related. It is the former that will be our concern in this\nsection.\n",
