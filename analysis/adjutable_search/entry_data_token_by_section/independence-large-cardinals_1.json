    "main_text": "The Interpretability Hierarchy\n2. The Interpretability Hierarchy\n\n\nOur aim is to investigate the space of mathematical theories\n(construed as recursively enumerable axiom systems).  The ordering on\nthe space of such theories that we will consider is that\nof interpretability.  The informal notion of interpretability\nis ubiquitous in mathematics; for example, Poincar\u00e9 provided an\ninterpretation of two dimensional hyperbolic geometry in the Euclidean\ngeometry of the unit circle; Dedekind provided an interpretation of\nanalysis in set theory; and G\u00f6del provided an interpretation of\nthe theory of formal syntax in arithmetic.\n\n\nWe shall use a precise formal regimentation of this informal notion.\nLet T1 and T2 be recursively enumerable axiom systems.  We say\nthat T1 is interpretable in T2 (T1 \u2264 T2) when,\nroughly speaking, there is a translation \u03c4 from the language of\nT1 to the language of T2 such that, for each sentence \u03c6 of\nthe language of T1, if T1\u22a2\u03c6 then\n T2\u22a2\u03c4(\u03c6).[7]\nWe shall write T1 < T2 when T1\u2264\nT2 and T2\u2270 T1 and we shall write T1\u2261 T2 when both\nT1\u2264 T2 and T2\u2264 T1.  In the latter case, T1 and T2\nare said to be mutually interpretable.  The equivalence class of\nall theories mutually interpretable with T is called the interpretability degree of T.\n\n\nFor ease of exposition we shall make three simplifying assumptions\nconcerning the theories under consideration.  First, we shall assume\nthat all of our theories are couched in the language of set theory.\nThere is no loss of generality in this assumption since every theory\nis mutually interpretable with a theory in this language.  For\nexample, as noted earlier, PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.  Second, we shall assume that all of our theories\ncontain ZFC-Infinity.  Third, we shall assume that all of our\ntheories are \u03a301-sound.\n\n\nThe interpretability hierarchy is the collection of all\ntheories (satisfying our three simplifying assumptions) ordered under\nthe relation \u2264. We now turn to a discussion of the structure of\nthis hierarchy.\n\n\nTo begin with, there is a useful characterization of the relation\n\u2264.  Let us write T1\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\u03a001 T2 to indicate that every\n\u03a001-statement provable in T1 is also provable in T2.  A\ncentral result in the theory of interpretability is that (granting our\nsimplifying assumptions) T1\u2264 T2 iff T1\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\u03a001 T2.\nIt follows from this characterization and the second incompleteness\ntheorem that for any theory T the theory T + Con(T) is strictly\nstronger than T, that is, \n T < T + Con(T).  Moreover, it follows\nfrom the arithmetized completeness theorem that the theory\nT + \u00acCon(T) is interpretable in T, hence,\nT \u2261 T + \u00acCon(T).\n\n\nIn terms of interpretability there are three possible ways in which a\nstatement \u03c6 can be independent of a theory T.\n\nSingle Jump. Only one of \u03c6 or \u00ac\u03c6 leads\n  to a jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 > T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 \u2261 T\n\n  (or likewise with \u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c6 interchanged).\nNo Jump. Neither \u03c6 nor \u00ac\u03c6 lead to a\n  jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 \u2261 T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 \u2261 T.\n  \nDouble Jump. Both \u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c6 lead to a\n  jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 > T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 > T.\n  \n\n\n\nIt turns out that each of these possibilities is realized.  For the\nfirst it suffices to take the \u03a001-sentence Con(T).  For the\nsecond it is easy to see that there is no example that is \u03a001;\nthe simplest possible complexity of such a sentence is \u039402\nand it turns out that there are such examples; examples of this type\nof independence are called Orey sentences.  For the third kind\nof independence there are \u03a001 instances.  (This is a corollary\nof Lemma 14 on pages 128\u2013129 of Lindstr\u00f6m (2003).)\n\n\nThese are all metamathematical examples, the kind of example that only\na logician would construct.  It is natural to ask whether there are\n\u201cnatural\u201d examples, roughly the sort of example occurring in the\nnormal course of mathematics.  In the set theoretic case, such\nexamples are abundant for the first two cases.  For example, PM is\nan example of the first kind of independence and CH is an example\nof the second kind of independence.  There are no known \u201cnatural\u201d\nexamples of the third kind of independence.  In the arithmetical case,\nsuch examples are rare.  There are examples of the first kind of\nindependence (the most famous of which is a classic example due to\nParis and Harrington) but none of the second or third kind of\nindependence.\n\n\nNotice that in the case of the third example the two theories above\nT are incomparable in the interpretability order.  To construct a\npair of such \u03a001-statements one uses a reciprocal form of the\ndiagonal lemma to construct two \u03a001-statements that refer to one\nanother.  Using such techniques can show that the interpretability\norder is quite complex.  For example, for any two theories T1 and\nT2 such that T1 < T2 there is a third theory T such that\nT1 < T < T2.  Thus, the order on the degrees of interpretability is\nneither linearly ordered nor well-founded.  (See Feferman (1960).)\n\n\nRemarkably, it turns out that when one restricts to those theories\nthat \u201carise in nature\u201d the interpretability ordering is quite\nsimple: There are no descending chains and there are no incomparable\nelements\u2014the interpretability ordering on theories that \u201carise in\nnature\u201d is a wellordering.  In particular, although there are natural\nexamples of the first and second kind of independence (e.g. PM and\nCH, respectively, something to which we will return to below),\nthere are no known natural examples of the third kind of independence.\n\n\nSo, for theories that \u201carise in nature\u201d, we have a wellordered\nhierarchy under the interpretability ordering.  At the base of the\nordering one has the degree that is represented by our minimal theory\nZFC-Infinity and there is only one way to proceed, namely, upward\nin terms of strength.\n\n\nWe have already seen one way of climbing the hierarchy of the degrees\nof interpretability, namely, by adding consistency statements.  There\nare two drawbacks to this approach.  First, if one starts with a\ntheory that \u201carises in nature\u201d and adds the consistency statement\none lands in a degree that has no known representative that \u201carises\nin nature\u201d.  Second, the consistency statement does not take one very\nfar up the hierarchy.  Both of these drawbacks are remedied by a very\nnatural class of axioms\u2014the large cardinal axioms.\n\nFurther Reading: For more on the structure of the\ninterpretability hierarchy see chapters 6\u20138 of Lindstr\u00f6m\n(2003).\n",
