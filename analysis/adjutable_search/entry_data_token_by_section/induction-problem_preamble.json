    "main_text": "\n\nWe generally think that the observations we make are able to justify\nsome expectations or predictions about observations we have not yet\nmade, as well as general claims that go beyond the observed. For\nexample, the observation that bread of a certain appearance has thus\nfar been nourishing seems to justify the expectation that the next\nsimilar piece of bread I eat will also be nourishing, as well as the\nclaim that bread of this sort is generally nourishing. Such inferences\nfrom the observed to the unobserved, or to general laws, are known as\n\u201cinductive inferences\u201d.\n\nThe original source of what has become known as the \u201cproblem of\ninduction\u201d is in Book 1, part iii, section 6 of A Treatise\nof Human Nature by David Hume, published in 1739 (Hume 1739). In\n1748, Hume gave a shorter version of the argument in Section iv of\nAn enquiry concerning human understanding (Hume 1748).\nThroughout this article we will give references to the\nTreatise as \u201cT\u201d, and the Enquiry as\n\u201cE\u201d.\n\nHume asks on what grounds we come to our beliefs about the unobserved\non the basis of inductive inferences. He presents an argument in the\nform of a dilemma which appears to rule out the possibility of any\nreasoning from the premises to the conclusion of an inductive\ninference. There are, he says, two possible types of arguments,\n\u201cdemonstrative\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d, but neither\nwill serve. A demonstrative argument produces the wrong kind of\nconclusion, and a probable argument would be circular. Therefore, for\nHume, the problem remains of how to explain why we form any\nconclusions that go beyond the past instances of which we have had\nexperience (T. 1.3.6.10). Hume stresses that he is not disputing that\nwe do draw such inferences. The challenge, as he sees it, is to\nunderstand the \u201cfoundation\u201d of the inference\u2014the\n\u201clogic\u201d or \u201cprocess of argument\u201d that it is\nbased upon (E. 4.2.21). The problem of meeting this challenge, while\nevading Hume\u2019s argument against the possibility of doing so, has\nbecome known as \u201cthe problem of induction\u201d.\n\nHume\u2019s argument is one of the most famous in philosophy. A\nnumber of philosophers have attempted solutions to the problem, but a\nsignificant number have embraced his conclusion that it is insoluble.\nThere is also a wide spectrum of opinion on the significance of the\nproblem. Some have argued that Hume\u2019s argument does not\nestablish any far-reaching skeptical conclusion, either because it was\nnever intended to, or because the argument is in some way\nmisformulated. Yet many have regarded it as one of the most profound\nphilosophical challenges imaginable since it seems to call into\nquestion the justification of one of the most fundamental ways in\nwhich we form knowledge. Bertrand Russell, for example, expressed the\nview that if Hume\u2019s problem cannot be solved, \u201cthere is no\nintellectual difference between sanity and insanity\u201d (Russell\n1946: 699).\n\nIn this article, we will first examine Hume\u2019s own argument,\nprovide a reconstruction of it, and then survey different responses to\nthe problem which it poses.\n",
