Locke\u2019s argument proceeds by\nfirst defending the idea of natural rights to property, which he\ngrounded in the fundamental importance of private holdings to the\nexercise of liberty, i.e., to the ability of persons to engage in\nindividual or collective projects. He argued that individuals can\nacquire property in land and other external material objects by\n\u2018mixing their labor\u2019 with it and thereby improving it\n(Locke ST: V,27). He then argues that the difficulties that\nwould be attendant on such an arrangement could only be solved by\ncreating a jurisdictional authority to govern such people and protect\ntheir rights. Individuals in the state of nature, or loosely\nassociated persons (e.g., families), many of whom have property in\nland, would, Locke argued, combine together to form a state to protect\ntheir rights. They would consent to majority rule, to obedience to and\nsupport for law (within the limits of natural law) and, importantly,\nconsent to incorporate one\u2019s rightful landholdings into the\nterritory over which the government has jurisdiction. Locke connects\nthe creation of authority over persons and authority over territory in\nthis way:\n\n\nBy the same Act therefore, whereby any one unite his Person, which was\nbefore free, to any Commonwealth; by the same he unites his\nPossessions, which were before free, to it also; and they become, both\nof them, Person and Possession, subject to the Government and Dominion\nof the Commonwealth, as long as it hath a being. (Locke ST:\nVIII, 120)\n\n\nThere are two justifications for the state: one is functional, since\nthe creation of political authority is necessary to solve the\ndeficiencies of the state of nature at least as regards the protection\nof people\u2019s natural rights; and the other is consent, as people\nin the state of nature are imagined to agree to a political order, an\nact which reconciles man\u2019s natural liberty with subjection to\ncommon authority. The natural right to property, on this argument, is\nconceived of as prior to the state, and an essential building block\nfor justifying the domain of state jurisdiction. By linking people and\nland together prior to the creation of political authority,\nLocke\u2019s theory can explain the domain of jurisdictional\nauthority. The boundaries of the state are coextensive with the\nboundaries of property that individual property holders incorporated\nwhen political society was created.\n\nAlthough this theory is able to explain how there might be legitimate\njurisdictional authority over various chunks of land, it also seems\nlikely that these would be perforated by land held by dissenters, or\nat the least non-continuous boundaries. This means that the theory is\nof limited usefulness in justifying the contiguous jurisdictional\nauthority of territorial states, where the writ of the law applies to\nall those contained within the external boundaries but there is no\nun-owned or un-consented interior land. In other words, this argument\ndoes not justify territorial right as we know it, where\nterritorial rights and especially jurisdictional authority are\nconsistently or evenly applied across the territory. This is not a\nflaw in itself. We shouldn\u2019t think of normative theory as intent\non justifying contemporary practices. However, it is a problem in so\nfar as that does not seem compatible with the performance of functions\nrelating to the exercise of jurisdictional authority, and\nfunctionality was also an important element in Locke\u2019s argument\nfor why individuals would seek to create a political order that has\nauthority over them in the first place and can adequately protect\ntheir natural rights.\n",
