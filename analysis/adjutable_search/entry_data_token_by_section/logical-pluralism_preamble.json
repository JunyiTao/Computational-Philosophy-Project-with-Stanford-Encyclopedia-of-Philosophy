    "main_text": "\n\nLogical pluralism is the view that there is more than one correct\nlogic. Logics are theories of validity: they tell us which argument\nforms are valid. Different logics disagree about which forms are\n valid.[1]\n For example, take ex falso quodlibet (EFQ): \n\\[\nA, \\neg A \\vDash  B\n\\]\n\n\nClassical and strong Kleene logics classify EFQ as valid, but relevant\nand paraconsistent logics say it is not. It is quite tempting to think\nthat they cannot all be right. If EFQ is valid, then the relevant and\nparaconsistent logics are not correct theories of validity, or as we\nmight put it: they are not correct logics. And if EFQ is not valid,\nthen classical and strong Kleene logic are not correct logics. Logical\npluralism takes many forms, but the most philosophically interesting\nand controversial versions hold that more than one logic can be\ncorrect, that is: logics \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) can disagree about which\narguments are valid, and both can be getting things right. What\nexactly it takes for a version of logical pluralism to be\nphilosophically interesting is addressed more fully below, especially\nin\n \u00a76.\n\nMuch current work on the subject was sparked by a series of papers by\nJC Beall and Greg Restall (Beall & Restall 2000, 2001; Restall\n2002), which culminated in a book (Beall & Restall 2006) on what\nwe here call case-based logical pluralism. This work has\ngenerated a substantial literature, including papers arguing against\npluralism, for logical monism\u2014the view that there is\nonly one correct logic\u2014and more recently exploring logical\nnihilism\u2014the view that there are no correct logics.\nInterest in this contemporary debate has also led to a re-examination\nof some older views, especially the question of whether Rudolf Carnap\nwas a logical pluralist (Restall 2002; Kouri Kissel 2019), and\nsimilarly for the Scottish-French logician Hugh McColl\n(1837\u20131909) (Rahman & Redmond 2008). It has also resulted in\nthe proposal of several additional kinds of logical pluralism, some of\nwhich are surveyed in\n \u00a75.\n",
