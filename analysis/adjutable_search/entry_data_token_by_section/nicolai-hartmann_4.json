What is the Place of Humankind in the World? || Aesthetics\n4.2 Aesthetics\n\nIf the \u201cplace\u201d of humankind is to give meaning to the\nworld, then meaning-giving through the arts has to be examined. In the\narts, humankind achieves some of its most significant instances of\nendowing the world with meaning. Hartmann says that \u201cthe\nbestowal of meaning that comes into human life via aesthetic values\nconsists fundamentally in nothing other than in the convincing feeling\nof standing face-to-face before something of absolutely intrinsic\nvalue\u2014before something for whose sake alone it would be worth\nliving, regardless of how the conditions of one\u2019s life stand\notherwise\u201d (AE35b).\n\nAs in the ethics and epistemology, one of the main features of\nHartmann\u2019s aesthetics is its close interplay with ontology.\nHartmann intentionally focuses his aesthetics on the problem of the\naesthetic object, and sets aside investigation of the correlated acts.\nHartmann distinguishes two \u201cstrata\u201d in the aesthetic\nobject, which he calls the foreground and the background. In his\nwords, \u201cthe aesthetics of today still concentrates mainly on\nanalysis of the act, and this is why the stratification relationship\n[in the object], although it has often been noted, is not yet familiar\nto it\u201d (P47a). The foreground is comprised of the real, concrete\nand sensible dimensions of the object, everything that is independent\nof the presence of a subject who beholds the object and seeks to\nunderstand it. The background strata vary with the kinds of content\nthe foreground lets appear, and the background exists only for the\nsubject who grasps it. This level is typically organized into many\ndistinct sub-levels. A theory of this kind obviously raises two\nquestions: first, how do we articulate the relationship between the\ntwo levels? Second, how do we articulate the relationship among the\nsublevels of the background stratum? In response to the first\nquestion, Hartmann describes a \u201crelationship of\nappearance\u201d on the basis of which\u2014as has been pointed out\non innumerable occasions\u2014the foreground (i.e., the matter of the\nobject) imposes constraints on the background. Most important for the\ndefinition of aesthetic values is to realize that these values attach\nto the \u201crelation of appearance\u201d itself. In other words,\nthe aesthetic values that fall under the general heading of\n\u201cbeauty\u201d are defined as values that are carried by the\n\u201cappearance relation\u201d that emerges between some materially\nexisting \u201cforeground\u201d of the object and some unreal\n\u201cbackground\u201d that exists only for the beholder. The skill\nof the artist consists in manipulating this relation of appearance.\nAesthetic values are different from moral or vital values in that they\ndo not attach to an existing thing, but exist only for a subject who\nappreciates aesthetically; they are values of the object as\n(intentional) object, independently of reality or unreality; they are\ntied to the relation of appearance itself; and they are values\nspecific to each object and unique to it (AE4c). In all cases, values\nlike beauty, the sublime, the graceful, charming, idyllic, or sweet,\nas well as all species of the comical, such as farce, the ridiculous,\nfunny, and humorous, are tied to the relation of appearance and\nspecific to each object. Notably, Hartmann completely revises\nKant\u2019s definition of the sublime, detaching it from the\ntranscendental, the realm of the quantitative, and the oppressive, and\nimplants it into the natural and human, terrestrial and nearby, fixing\nit in the object and a \u201cpsychic need of the human heart\u201d\n(AE31b). It is rooted in the \u201cattraction of the human heart to\nwhat is magnificent\u201d (AE31c), and our human desire to bring\nmeaning into life. The sublime is a form of beauty that responds to\nthe human need for greatness. \u201cIt is that specific appearing of\nan unsensed background in a real sensed foreground of the object,\nwhich accommodates the needs of man for greatness, and, with the\ngreatest ease, overcomes any resistance opposed to it\u201d (AE31c).\nIt is also noteworthy that Hartmann treats both comedy and music at\nfar greater length in the Aesthetics than most other authors\nof comparable works in the history of philosophy.\n\nThat part of the theory which concerns the typical stratification of\nthe background is completely original. In response to the second\nquestion above, the answer is that different aesthetic objects display\ndifferent articulations of the background stratum. In the case of\nliterary works, for example, Hartmann distinguishes at least six\ndifferent levels for more sophisticated genres like epic narratives or\nnovels, while other genres have fewer levels. This applies to lyrical\npoems, for example, whose expressiveness is articulated into fewer\nlevels because of the constraints imposed on the admissible expressive\nforms. Hartmann cites the portrait as an example of a visual aesthetic\nobject. He distinguishes the following levels in its background\nstratum: the three-dimensional space in which the subject of the\nportrait and some elements of the setting appear; the movement of the\nsubject\u2019s apparent corporeality; the subject\u2019s character;\ntheir individual idea, or the idea that the person portrayed has of\nthemselves; the symbolic, or the universal content manifested by the\nportrait. His discriminating and extensive analyses of works by\nBeethoven, Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Rembrandt, among many others, are\nworthy of close consideration by theorists, as is the entire\ntheory.\n\nAs in the ethics, Hartmann again reminds readers of what the analysis\nteaches us about the place of humankind in the world. \u201cIf man\nwith his powers, his sense of values, and his occasional capacity for\nrealizing values, is capable of bestowing meaning and value, then\nprecisely the senselessness of the world as a whole obtains a meaning\nfor him. [\u2026] A world that, without man, was already filled with\nmeaning would render him superfluous even despite his gifts for\nbestowing meaning\u201d (AE35a). Both the ethics and aesthetics\nentail a unique philosophical anthropology that inserts humankind into\nthe complex stratified structure of the world.\n",
