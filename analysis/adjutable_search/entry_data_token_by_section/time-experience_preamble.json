    "main_text": "\n\nWe see colours, hear sounds and feel textures. Some aspects of the\nworld, it seems, are perceived through a particular sense. Others,\nlike shape, are perceived through more than one sense. But what sense\nor senses do we use when perceiving time? It is certainly not\nassociated with one particular sense. In fact, it seems odd to say\nthat we see, hear or touch time passing. And indeed, even if all our\nsenses were prevented from functioning for a while, we could still\nnotice the passing of time through the changing pattern of our\nthought. Perhaps, then, we have a special faculty, distinct from the\nfive senses, for detecting time. Or perhaps, as seems more likely, we\nnotice time through perception of other things. But how?\n\nTime perception raises a number of intriguing puzzles, including what\nit means to say we perceive time. In this article, we shall\nexplore the various processes through which we are made aware of time,\nand which influence the way we think time really is. Inevitably, we\nshall be concerned with the psychology of time perception, but the\npurpose of the article is to draw out the philosophical issues, and in\nparticular whether and how aspects of our experience can be\naccommodated within certain metaphysical theories concerning the\nnature of time and causation.\n",
