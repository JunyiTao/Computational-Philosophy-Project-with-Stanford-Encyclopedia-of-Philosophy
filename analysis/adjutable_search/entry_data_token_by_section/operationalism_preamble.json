    "main_text": "\n\nOperationalism is based on the intuition that we do not know the\nmeaning of a concept unless we have a method of measurement for it. It\nis commonly considered a theory of meaning which states that \u201cwe\nmean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept\nis synonymous with the corresponding set of operations\u201d\n(Bridgman 1927, 5). That drastic statement was made in The Logic\nof Modern Physics, published in 1927 by the American physicist P.\nW. Bridgman. The operationalist point of view, first expounded at\nlength in that book, initially found many advocates among practicing\nphysicists and those inspired by the tradition of American pragmatism\nor the new philosophy of logical positivism. It is highly doubtful\nthat Bridgman intended to advance a precise and universal theory of\nmeaning, or any systematic philosophical theory at all. His writings\nwere primarily \u201creflections of a\n physicist\u201d[1]\n rooted in experimental practice and aimed at articulating the\nscientific method from a first-person point of view. However, as\nBridgman\u2019s ideas gained currency they were shaped into a general\nphilosophical doctrine of \u201coperationalism\u201d or\n\u201coperationism\u201d, and in that form became very influential\nin many areas, especially in methodological debates in psychology.\nBoth in philosophy and in psychology operationalism is nowadays\ncommonly regarded as an extreme and outmoded position, but that is not\nto say that the potential of the early ideas has been exhausted.\n\nThis article has three sections, each of which serves a different aim.\nSection 1 introduces Bridgman\u2019s key ideas on operational\nanalysis, explaining their motivations and tracing the course of their\ndevelopment. Section 2 summarizes various critiques of operationalism,\nwhich eventually led to a general philosophical consensus against it.\nSection 3 gives a view on the remaining potential of Bridgman\u2019s\nideas on operational analysis for philosophy of science today.\n",
