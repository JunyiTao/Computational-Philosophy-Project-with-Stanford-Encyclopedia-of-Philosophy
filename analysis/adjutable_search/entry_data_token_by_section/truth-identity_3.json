    "main_text": "Identity, Sense, and Reference\n4. Identity, Sense, and Reference\n\nIdentity theorists are agreed that, in the case of any particular\nrelevant identity, a fact will constitute the worldly relatum\nof the relation, but there is significant disagreement among them on\nthe question what the item on the other end of the relation\nis\u2014whether a thought or a proposition (or both). As we have\nseen, there are three possible positions here: (i) one which places\nthe identity relation exclusively between true thoughts and facts,\n(ii) one which places it exclusively between true propositions and\nfacts, and (iii) a hybrid position which allows identities of both\nsorts (identities obtaining at the level of sense will of course be\nquite distinct from identities obtaining at the level of reference).\nWhich of these positions an identity theorist adopts will depend on\nwider metaphysical and linguistic considerations that are strictly\nextraneous to the identity theory as such.\n\nIdentity theorists who favor (i) generally do so because they want to\nhave nothing to do with propositions as such. That is to say,\nsuch theorists eschew propositions as reference-level\nentities: of course the word \u201cproposition\u201d\nmay be, and sometimes is, applied to Fregean thoughts at the level of\nsense, rather than to Russellian propositions at the level of\nreference. For example, Hornsby (1997: 2\u20133) uses\n\u201cproposition\u201d and \u201cthinkable\u201d interchangeably.\nSo far, this terminological policy might be considered neutral with\nrespect to the location of propositions and thinkables in the Fregean\nsemantic hierarchy: that is to say, if one encounters a theorist who\ntalks about \u201cthinkables\u201d and \u201cpropositions\u201d,\neven identifying them, one does not, just so far, know where in the\nsemantic hierarchy this theorist places these entities. In particular,\nwe cannot assume, unless we are specifically told so, that our\ntheorist locates either propositions or thinkables at the level of\nsense. After all, someone who houses propositions at the\nlevel of reference holds that these reference-level entities are\nthinkable, in the sense that they are graspable in\nthought (perhaps via thoughts at the level of sense). But they\nare not thinkables if this latter word is taken, as it is by\nMcDowell and Hornsby, to be a technical term referring to entities at\nthe level of sense. For clarity the policy here will be to continue to\napply the word \u201cproposition\u201d exclusively to Russellian\npropositions at the level of reference. Such propositions, it is\nplausible to suppose, can be grasped in thought, but by definition\nthey are not thoughts or thinkables, where these two latter terms\nhave, respectively, their Fregean and McDowellian meanings. It is\nworth noting that this point, though superficially a merely\nterminological one, engages significantly with the interface between\nthe philosophies of language and mind that was touched on in the\nopening paragraph. Anyone who holds that reference-level propositions\ncan, in the ordinary sense, be thought\u2014are thinkable\u2014is\nlikely to be unsatisfied with any terminology that seems to limit the\ndomain of the thinkable and of what is thought to the level of sense\n(On this point see further below in this section, and Gaskin 2020:\n101\u20132).\n\nUsually, as has been noted, identity theorists who favor (i) above\nhave this preference because they repudiate propositions as that term\nis being employed here: that is, they repudiate propositionally\nstructured reference-level entities. There are several reasons why\nsuch identity theorists feel uncomfortable with propositions when\nthese are understood to be reference-level entities. There is a fear\nthat such propositions, if they existed, would have to be construed as\ntruth-makers; and identity theorists, as we have seen, want to have\nnothing to do with truth-makers (Dodd 2008a: 112). That fear could\nperhaps be defused if facts were also located at the level of\nreference for true propositions to be identical with. This move would\ntake us to an identity theory in the style of (ii) or (iii) above.\nAnother reason for suspicion of reference-level propositions is that\ncommentators often follow Russell in his post-1904 aversion\nspecifically to false objectives, that is, to false\npropositions in re (Russell 1966: 152; Cartwright 1987:\n79\u201384). Such entities are often regarded as too absurd to take\nseriously as components of reality (so T. Baldwin 1991: 46; Dodd 1995:\n163; 1996; 2008a: 66\u201370, 113\u201314, 162\u20136). More\nespecially, it has been argued that false propositions in re\ncould not be unities, that the price of unifying a proposition at the\nlevel of reference would be to make it true: if this point were\ncorrect it would arguably constitute a reductio ad absurdum\nof the whole idea of reference-level propositions, since it is\nplausible to suppose that if there cannot be false reference-level\npropositions, there cannot be true ones either (see Dodd 2008a: 165).\nIf, on the other hand, one is happy with the existence of propositions\nin re or reference-level propositions, both true and\n false,[6]\n one is likely to favor an identity theory in the style of (ii) or\n(iii). And, once one has got as far as jettisoning (i) and deciding\nbetween (ii) and (iii), there must surely be a good case for adopting\n(iii): for if one has admitted propositionally structured entities\nboth at the level of sense (as senses of declarative sentences) and at\nthe level of reference (propositions), there seems no good reason not\nto be maximally liberal in allowing identities between entities of\nthese two types and, respectively, sense- and reference-level kinds of\nfact (or fact-like entities).\n\nAgainst what was suggested above about Frege\n (\u00a72),\n it has been objected that Frege could not have held an identity\ntheory of truth (Baldwin 1991: 43); the idea here is that, even if he\nhad acknowledged states of affairs as bona fide elements of\nreality, Frege could not have identified true thoughts with them on\npain of confusing the levels of sense and reference. As far as the\nexegetical issue is concerned, the objection might be said to overlook\nthe possibility that Frege identified true thoughts with facts\nconstrued as sense-level entities, rather than with states of\naffairs taken as reference-level entities; and, as we have\nnoted, Frege does indeed appear to have done just this (see Dodd &\nHornsby 1992). Still, the objection raises an important theoretical\nissue. It would surely be a serious confusion to try to construct an\nidentity across the categorial division separating sense and\nreference, in particular to attempt to identify true Fregean thoughts\nwith reference-level facts or states of\n affairs.[7]\n It has been suggested that McDowell and Hornsby are guilty of this\n confusion;[8]\n they have each rejected the\n charge,[9]\n insisting that, for them, facts are not reference-level entities, but\nare, like Fregean thoughts, sense-level\n entities.[10]\n\nBut, if one adheres to the Fregean version of the identity theory ((i)\nabove), which identifies true thoughts with facts located at the level\nof sense, and admits no correlative identity, in addition, connecting\ntrue propositions located at the level of reference with facts or\nfact-like entities also located at that level, it looks as though one\nfaces a difficult dilemma. At what level in the semantical hierarchy\nis the world to be placed? Suppose first one puts it at the level of\nreference (this appears to be Dodd\u2019s favored view: see 2008a:\n180\u20131, and passim). In that case the world will contain\nno facts or propositions, but just objects and properties hanging\nloose in splendid isolation from one another, a dispensation which\nlooks like a version of Kantian transcendental idealism. (Simply\ninsisting that the properties include not merely monadic but also\npolyadic ones, such as the relation of instantiation, will not in\nitself solve the problem: we will still just have a bunch of separate\nobjects, properties, and relations.) If there are no true\npropositions\u2014no facts\u2014or even false propositions to be\nfound at the level of reference, but if also, notwithstanding that\nabsence, the world is located there, the objects it contains will, it\nseems, have to be conceived as bare objects, not as things of certain\nsorts. Some philosophers of a nominalistic bias might be happy with\nthis upshot; but the problem is how to make sense of the idea of a\nbare object\u2014that is, an object not characterized by any\nproperties. (Properties not instantiated by any objects, by contrast,\nwill not be problematic, at least not for a realist.)\n\nSo suppose, on the other hand, that one places the world at the level\nof sense, on the grounds that the world is composed of facts, and that\nthat is where facts are located. This ontological dispensation is\nexplicitly embraced by McDowell (1996: 179). The problem with this way\nout of the dilemma would seem to be that, since Fregean senses are\nconstitutively modes of presentation of referents, the strategy under\ncurrent consideration would take the world to be made up of modes of\npresentation\u2014but of what? Of objects and properties? These are\ncertainly reference-level entities, but if they are presented by items\nin the realm of sense, which is being identified on this approach with\nthe world, then again, as on the first horn of the dilemma, they would\nappear to be condemned to an existence at the level of reference in\nsplendid isolation from one another, rather than in propositionally\nstructured combinations, so that once more we would seem to be\ncommitted to a form of Kantian transcendental idealism (see Suhm,\nWagemann, & Wessels 2000: 32; Sullivan 2005: 59\u201361; Gaskin\n2006:199\u2013203). Both ways out of the dilemma appear to have this\nunattractive consequence. The only difference between those ways\nconcerns where exactly in the semantic hierarchy we locate the world;\nbut it is plausible that that issue, in itself, is or ought to be of\nless concern to metaphysicians than the requirement to avoid divorcing\nobjects from the properties that make those objects things of certain\nsorts; and both ways out of the dilemma appear to flout this\nrequirement.\n\nTo respect the requirement, we need to nest reference-level objects\nand properties in propositions, or proposition-like structures, also\nlocated at the level of reference. And then some of these structured\nreference-level entities\u2014the true or obtaining ones\u2014will,\nit seems, be facts, or at least fact-like. Furthermore, once one\nacknowledges the existence of facts, or fact-like entities, existing\nat the level of sense, it seems in any case impossible to\nprevent the automatic generation of facts, or fact-like entities,\nresiding at the level of reference. For sense is mode of\npresentation of reference. So we need reference-level facts or\nfact-like entities to be what sense-level facts or fact-like entities\npresent. One has to decide how to treat these variously\nhoused fact-like entities theoretically. If one were to insist that\nthe sense-level fact-like entities were the genuine and only\nfacts, the corresponding reference-level entities would be no\nbetter than fact-like, and contrariwise. But, regardless\nwhether the propositionally structured entities automatically\ngenerated in this way by sense-level propositionally structured\nentities are to be thought of as proper facts or merely as fact-like\nentities, it would seem perverse not to identify the world with these\n entities.[11]\n For to insist on continuing to identify the world with sense-level\nrather than reference-level propositionally structured entities would\nseem to fly in the face of a requirement to regard the world as\nmaximally objective and maximally non-perspectival. McDowell himself\nhopes to avert any charge of embracing an unacceptable idealism\nconsequent on his location of the world at the level of sense by\nrelying on the point that senses present their references directly,\nnot descriptively, so that reference is, as it were, contained in\nsense (1996: 179\u201380). To this it might be objected that the\nrequirement of maximal objectivity forces an identification of the\nworld with the contained, not the containing, entities in this\nscenario, which in turn seems to force the upshot\u2014if the threat\nof Kantian transcendental idealism is really to be obviated\u2014that\nthe contained entities be propositionally structured as such, that is,\nas contained entities, and not simply in virtue of being\ncontained in propositionally structured containing entities.
