So, for example, consider the following cases.\n\n\n(60) John is a lawyer.\n\n(61) John is the mayor of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nIt is not unusual to think of \u2018is a lawyer\u2019 and \u2018is\nthe mayor of Pittsburgh\u2019 as predicates. In the case of (60), we\nintuitively are not saying that there is a lawyer such that John is\nidentical to that lawyer. Indeed, as Williams (1983) observed, this\nappearance is even more pronounced if we consider cases like (62).\n\n(62) John is not a lawyer\n\n\n(62) does not seem to have the meaning that there is a lawyer such\nthat John is not identical to that lawyer. It is more natural to take\nan utterance of (62) as denying that John has a certain property.\n\nIf this is right, then the copula \u2018is\u2019 is really just the\n\u2018is\u2019 of predication and semantically dispensable\n(significantly, it routinely does not appear in many other languages\nunless it is needed to carry tense or other inflectional information).\nLikewise, we might say that the indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is\nsemantically inert as well\u2014a mere \u201cgrace note\u201d in\nHigginbotham\u2019s (1987) terminology. In this vein, one widely held\nview, due to Kamp (1981) and Heim (1982), is that we could regard\nindefinite descriptions as expressions containing free variables which\nare bound by adverbs of quantification (in the sense of Lewis (1975))\ninterpreted as existentially quantified by the model theory, or\nperhaps bound by implicit existential closure operators (Diesing\n1992).\n\nFor linguists it is now standard to think of indefinite descriptions\nfollowing the copula as always being predicational, and it is a\nwidespread belief that definite descriptions following the copula are\noften predicational. Philosophers have also been attracted to this\nview. See, for example, Geach (1962; section 39), Wiggins (1965, 42\nff.), Kim (1970; 211 ff.), Wilson (1978), Smiley (1981),\u00a0Heim\n(1982) and Higginbotham (1987) among others). Does it follow that we\nmust admit two different kinds of descriptions (quantificational and\npredicational)? We saw that singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions can be unified; can we perform the same unification trick\nhere?\n\nFara (2001) pursued the possibility that all uses of definite\ndescriptions are predicational\u2014even descriptions in subject\nposition. The idea is that if I say \u2018The present King of France\nis bald\u2019, I am saying something like the following: some\nx is such that x is the unique present king of\nFrance and x is bald. The interesting riff here is the notion\nthat the uniqueness condition is built into the predicate. Extending\nthe Sharvy (1980) analysis of plural descriptions, we get the\nfollowing, where F is the set of all Fs, or the mass\nof all substance that is F (the vertical strokes before ad\nafter and after the expression indicate that we are talking about the\nsemantic value, or meaning, of the bordered expression):\n\n\n\n\n(63)\n||an F|| = F \n\n\u00a0\n||the F|| = {x: x \u2208 F\n& \u2200y(y\u2208F \u2192\ny\u2264x)}  \n\n\n\nBut again we might consider collapsing the distinction between\ndefinite and indefinite descriptions here, and say that there is a\nsingle rule that interprets all descriptions\u2014definite,\nindefinite, singular, plural, mass, or generic\u2014as predicates.\nWhen we supplement this with the rejection of the\nuniqueness/maximality clause we get this result:\n\n(63\u2032) ||the F/the Fs/an F/some\nFs|| = F\n\n\nIf this is right then the determiners \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019 are both \u201cgrace notes\u201d not just in\nspecial positions, but across the board.\n\u00a0",
