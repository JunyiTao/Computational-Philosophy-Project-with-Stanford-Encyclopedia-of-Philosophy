    "main_text": "The Long Reach of Microbiome Research || Causality issues\n5.2 Causality issues\n\nAlthough philosophers drawing on microbiome research have tended so\nfar to focus on metaphysical issues of individuality, issues\nassociated with microbiome explanations are probably more pressing for the\nscience and are now undergoing philosophical scrutiny. These\ninvestigations can work in two directions: using philosophical\nframeworks to explore the nature of microbiome causality or even\nwhether it occurs (e.g., Lynch et al. 2019), then using the insights\ngained to reflect further on the philosophy of causal explanation. For\nexample, Gillies (2019) examines treatment regimes arising out of\nmicrobiome research and proposes a \u201ccausal law\u201d account of\nexplanation to account for such phenomena. Other approaches take\nframeworks for causal explanation such as interventionism (see\n SEP entry on causation and manipulability)\n and propose refinements that arise from examinations of putative\nmicrobiome causality (Attah et al. 2020; Oftedal 2020). A particularly\nstrong finding of such analyses is that tradeoffs between key\ndimensions of causal explanation (stability, specificity,\nproportionality) require further philosophical attention.\n\nObviously, microbiome research is only one aspect of microbiology, but\nit illustrates nicely the general point of the philosophical richness\nof microbiological science. The occupation of humans by trillions of\nmicrobes means that traditional views of health, bodies, and even\nminds (according to some emerging research) need supplementing by\nmicrobial and microbiological perspectives. Because some of this new\nknowledge has only recently been revealed by large-scale molecular\ntechniques, many of the strongest and most \u201crevolutionary\u201d\nclaims require more rigorous conceptualization and analysis. But this\nis not exclusively a feature of microbe-associated science. Nor is the\noccupation of human bodies unique to microbes: helminths (worms) are\nhistorical human passengers, and are frequently argued to have\nsystem-wide benefits for their hosts that outweigh any harms (e.g.,\nLuke\u0161 et al. 2015). Nevertheless, we do not expect to see\nanytime soon a SEP entry on helminths. To clarify why, this essay will\nconclude by reiterating the several angles from which microbes and\nmicrobiology can be considered philosophically valuable.\n",
