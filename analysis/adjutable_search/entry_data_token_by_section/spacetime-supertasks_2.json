    "main_text": "Mechanical properties || Missing limits: Thomson\u2019s Lamp\n1.2 Missing limits: Thomson\u2019s Lamp\n\nSupertasks are often described by sequences that do not converge. J.\nF. Thomson (1954) introduced one such example now known as Thomson\u2019s\nLamp, which he thought illustrated a sense in which supertasks truly\nare paradoxical.\n\nSuppose we switch off a lamp. After 1 minute we switch it on. After\n\u00bd a minute more we switch it off again, \u00bc on, \u215b\noff, and so on. Summing each of these times gives rise to an infinite\ngeometric series that converges to 2 minutes, after which time the\nentire supertask has been completed. But when 2 minutes is up, is the\nlamp on or off?\n\n\nFig 1.2.1. Thomson\u2019s lamp.\n\n\nIt may seem absurd to claim that it is on: for each moment that the\nlamp was turned on, there is a later moment at which it was turned\noff. But it would seem equally absurd to claim that it is off: for\neach moment that the lamp is turned off, there is a later moment that\nit was turned on. This paradox, according to Thomson, suggests that\nthe supertask associated with the lamp is impossible.\n\nTo analyze the paradox, Thomson suggested we represent the\n\u201con\u201d state of the map with the number 1 and the\n\u201coff\u201d state with 0. The supertask then consists in the\nsequence of states,\n\n\\[\n0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \\ldots .\n\\]\n\n\nThis sequence does not converge to any real number in the standard\nreal topology. However, one might redefine what it means for a\nsequence to converge in response to this. For example, we could define\nconvergence in terms of the arithmetic mean. Given a sequence\n\\(x_n\\), the Ces\u00e0ro mean is the sequence\n\\(C_1 = x_1\\), \\(C_2 = (x_1 + x_2)/2\\), \\(C_3 = (x_1 + x_2 +\nx_3)/3\\), and so on. These numbers describe the average value\nof the sequence up to a given term. One says that a sequence\n\\(x_n\\) Ces\u00e0ro converges to a number \\(C\\) if and\nonly if \\(C_n\\) converges (in the ordinary sense) to \\(C\\). It is\nthen well-known that the sequence \\(0, 1, 0, 1, \\ldots\\) Ces\u00e0ro\nconverges to \u00bd (see e.g. Bashirov 2014).\n\nThomson pointed out that this argument is not very helpful without an\ninterpretation of what lamp-state is represented by \u00bd. We want\nto know if the lamp is on or off; saying that its end state is\nassociated with a convergent arithmetic mean of \u00bd does little\nto answer the question. However, this approach to resolving the\nparadox has still been pursued, for example by P\u00e9rez\nLaraudogoita, Bridger and Alper (2002) and by Dolev (2007).\n\nAre there other consistent ways to describe the final state of\nThomson\u2019s lamp in spite of the missing limit?\n\nBenacerraf (1962) pointed out a sense in which the answer is yes. The\ndescription of the Thomson lamp only actually specifies what the lamp\nis doing at each finite stage before 2 minutes. It says nothing about\nwhat happens at 2 minutes, especially given the lack of a converging\nlimit. It may still be possible to \u201ccomplete\u201d the\ndescription of Thomson\u2019s lamp in a way that leads it to be either on\nafter 2 minutes or off after 2 minutes. The price is that the final\nstate will not be reached from the previous states by a convergent\nsequence. But this by itself does not amount to a logical\ninconsistency.\n\nSuch a completion of Thomson\u2019s description was explicitly constructed\nby Earman and Norton (1996) using the following example of a bouncing\nball.\n\nSuppose a metal ball bounces on a conductive plate, bouncing a little\nlower each time until it comes to a rest on the plate. Suppose the\nbounces follow the same geometric pattern as before. Namely, the ball\nis in the air for 1 minute after the first bounce, \u00bd minute\nafter the second bounce, \u00bc minute after the third, \u215b\nminute after the fourth, and so on. Then the entire infinite sequence\nof bounces is a supertask.\n\nNow suppose that the ball completes a circuit when it strikes the\nmetal plate, thereby switching on a lamp. This is a physical system\nthat implements Thomson\u2019s lamp. In particular, the lamp is switched on\nand off infinitely many times over the course of a finite duration of\n2 minutes.\n\n\nFig 1.2.2.\nThomson\u2019s lamp implemented by a bouncing ball: contact of\nthe bouncing ball with the plate switches the Thomson lamp on. The\nsupertask ends with the lamp on.\n\n\nWhat is the state of this lamp after 2 minutes? The ball will have\ncome to rest on the plate, and so the lamp will be on. There is no\nmystery in this description of Thomson\u2019s lamp.\n\nAlternatively, we could arrange the ball so as to break the circuit\nwhen it makes contact with the plate. This gives rise to another\nimplementation of Thomson\u2019s lamp, but one that is off after 2 minutes\nwhen the ball comes to its final resting state.\n\n\nFig 1.2.3.\nAnother implementation of Thomson\u2019s lamp: contact of the bouncing ball\nwith the plate switches the Thomson lamp off. The supertask ends with\nthe lamp off.\n\n\nThese examples show that is possible to fill in the details of\nThomson\u2019s lamp in a way that either renders it definitely on after the\nsupertask, or definitely off. For this reason, Earman and Norton\nconclude with Benacerraf that the Thomson lamp is not a matter of\nparadox but of an incomplete description.\n\nAs with the Zeno Dichotomy, there is a regressive version of the\nThomson lamp supertask. Such a lamp has been studied by Uzquiano\n(2012), although as a set of instructions rather than a set of tasks.\nConsider a lamp that has been switched on at 2 seconds\npast the hour, off at 1 second past, on at \u00bd a second past, off\nat \u00bc a second past, and so on. What is the state\nof the lamp on the hour, just before the supertask has begun? This\nsupertask can be viewed as incomplete in the same way as the original\nThomson lamp. Insofar as the mechanics of bouncing balls and electric\ncircuits described in Earman and Norton\u2019s lamp are time reversal invariant, it follows that the time-reversed system is a possibility as well, which is spontaneously excited to begin bouncing, providing a physical implementation of the regressive Thomson\nlamp. However, whether the reversed Thomson lamp is a physical possibility\ndepends on whether or not the system is time reversible. A difficulty is that its initial state will not determine the subsequent history of an infinity of alternations.\n",
