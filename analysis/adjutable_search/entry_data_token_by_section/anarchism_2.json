Bakunin extended his\ncritique to include religion, arguing against both God and the State.\nBakunin rejected God as the absolute master, saying famously,\n\u201cif God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish\nhim\u201d (Bakunin 1882 [1970: 28]).\n\nThere are, however, religious versions of anarchism, which critique\npolitical authority from a standpoint that takes religion seriously.\nRapp (2012) has shown how anarchism can be found in Taoism. And\nRamnath (2011) has identified anarchist threads in Islamic Sufism, in\nHindu bhakti movements, in Sikhism\u2019s anti-caste\nefforts, and in Buddhism. We consider anarchism in connection with\nGandhi below. But we focus here on Christian anarchism.\n\nChristian anarchist theology views the kingdom of God as lying beyond\nany human principle of structure or order. Christian anarchists offer\nan anti-clerical critique of ecclesiastical and political power.\nTolstoy provides an influential example. Tolstoy claims that\nChristians have a duty not to obey political power and to refuse to\nswear allegiance to political authority (see Tolstoy 1894). Tolstoy\nwas also a pacifist. Christian anarcho-pacifism views the state as\nimmoral and unsupportable because of its connection with military\npower (see Christoyannopoulos 2011). But there are also non-pacifist\nChristian anarchists. Berdyaev, for example, builds upon Tolstoy and\nin his own interpretation of Christian theology. Berdyaev concludes:\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God is anarchy\u201d (Berdyaev 1940 [1944:\n148]).\n\nChristian anarchists have gone so far as to found separatist\ncommunities where they live apart from the structures of the state.\nNotable examples include New England transcendentalists such as\nWilliam Garrison and Adin Ballou. These transcendentalists had an\ninfluence on Tolstoy (see Perry 1973 [1995]).\n\nOther notable Christians with anarchist sympathies include Peter\nMaurin and Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. In more recent\nyears, Christian anarchism has been defended by Jacques Ellul who\nlinks Christian anarchism to a broad social critique. In addition to\nbeing pacifistic, Ellul says, Christian anarchism should also be\n\u201cantinationalist, anticapitalist, moral, and\nantidemocratic\u201d (Ellul 1988 [1991: 13]). The Christian anarchist\nought to be committed to \u201ca true overturning of authorities of\nall kinds\u201d (Ellul 1988 [1991: 14]). When asked whether a\nChristian anarchist should vote, Ellul says no. He states,\n\u201canarchy first implies conscientious objection\u201d (Ellul\n1988 [1991: 15]).\n",
