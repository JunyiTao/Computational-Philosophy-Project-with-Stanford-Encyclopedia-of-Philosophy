But if not the name, the ideas themselves are\nvery ancient, and any survey of the history of philosophy will uncover\nnumerous pantheist or pantheistically inclined thinkers; although it\nshould also be noted that in many cases all that history has preserved\nfor us are second-hand reportings of attributed doctrines, any\nreconstruction of which is too conjectural to provide much by way of\nphilosophical illumination (see Kahn 1960).\n\nAt its most general, pantheism may be understood either (a)\npositively, as the view that God is identical with the cosmos (i.e.,\nthe view that there exists nothing which is outside of God), or (b)\nnegatively, as the rejection of any view that considers God as\ndistinct from the universe.\n\nHowever, given the complex and contested nature of the concepts\ninvolved, there is insufficient consensus among philosophers to permit\nthe construction of any more detailed definition not open to serious\nobjection from some quarter or other. Moreover, the label is a\ncontroversial one, where strong desires either to appropriate or to\nreject it often serve only to obscure the actual issues, and it would\nbe a sad irony if pantheism revealed itself to be most like a\ntraditional religion in its sectarian disputes over just what counts\nas \u2018true pantheism.\u2019 Therefore pantheism should not be\nthought of as a single codifiable position. Rather it should be\nunderstood as a diverse family of distinct doctrines; many of whom\nwould be surprised\u2014and, indeed, disconcerted\u2014to find\nthemselves regarded as members of a single household. Further, since\nthe concept has porous and disputed boundaries there is no clear\nconsensus on just who qualifies, no definitive roll-call of past\npantheists. Given this situation the range of things that may be\nusefully said about all pantheisms is perhaps limited, but\nnonetheless a variety of concepts may be clarified, the nature of\ncontentious issues explored, and the range of possible options more\nprecisely mapped out (see Buckareff & Nagasawa 2016; Buckareff\n2022).\n", "toc": [{"#PantReliLitePhil": "1.

Pantheism in religion, literature, and philosophy\n\nThere are several different ways to think about pantheism. (1) Many of\nthe world\u2019s religious traditions and spiritual writings are\nmarked by pantheistic ideas and feelings. This is particularly so for\nexample, in Hinduism of the Advaita Vedanta school, in some varieties\nof Kabbalistic Judaism, in Celtic spirituality, and in Sufi mysticism.\n(2) Another vital source of pantheistic ideas is to be found in\nliterature, for example, in such writers as Goethe, Coleridge,\nWordsworth, Emerson, Walt Whitman, D.H. Lawrence, and Robinson\nJeffers. Although it should be added that, far from being limited to\nhigh culture, pantheistic themes are familiar, too, in popular media,\nfor example in such films as Star Wars, Avatar, and The\nLion King. (3) Thirdly, as it is in this article, pantheism may\nbe considered philosophically; that is, a critical\nexamination may be made of its central ideas with respect to their\nmeaning, their coherence, and the case to be made for or against their\nacceptance.\n2. Arguments for / drives towards pantheism\n\nA good way to understand any view is to appreciate the kind of drives\nthat may push someone towards it. What arguments may be given for\npantheism? Although there are a great many different individual lines\nof reasoning that might be offered, generally they may be placed under\ntwo heads; arguments \u2018from below\u2019, which start from a\nposteriori religious experience, and arguments \u2018from\nabove\u2019, which start from a priori philosophical\nabstraction.\n\nFollowing the first type of argument, pantheistic belief arises when\nthe things of this world excite a particular sort of religious\nreaction in us. We feel, perhaps, a deep reverence for and\nsense of identity with the world in which we find\nourselves. Epistemically it seems to us that God is not distant but\ncan be encountered directly in what we experience around us. We see\nGod in everything. The initial focus of attention here may be either\nour physical environment (the land on which we live, our natural\nenvironment) or else our social environment (our community, our tribe,\nour nation or, generally, the people we meet with) but further\nreflection may lead to its more universal expansion.\n\nIn the second kind of argument, reasoning starts from a relatively\nabstract concept whose application is taken as assured, but further\nreflection leads to the conclusion that its scope must be extended to\ninclude the whole of reality. Most typically, the concept in question\nis that of \u2018God\u2019, or \u2018perfect being\u2019, in which\ncase pantheism appears as the logical terminus or completion of\ntheism. The following paragraphs illustrate four examples of such\nreasoning.\n\n(1) Traditional theism asserts the omnipresence of God and,\nwhile it strongly wishes to maintain that this is not equivalent to\npantheism, the difference between saying that God is present\neverywhere in everything and saying that God is\neverything is far from easy to explain. If omnipresence means, not\nsimply that God is cognisant of or active in all places, but literally\nthat he exists everywhere, then it is hard to see how any finite being\ncan be said to have existence external to God. Indeed, for Isaac\nNewton and Samuel Clarke divine omnipresence was one and the same\nthing as space, which they understood as \u2018the sensorium of\nGod\u2019 (Oakes 2006). One recent variant of this position is\nLogical Pantheism according to which God is identified with\nlogical space, with the totality of all possible worlds.\n(Aranyosi 2022)\n\n(2) The traditional theistic position that God\u2019s creation of the\nuniverse is continuous can easily be developed in pantheistic\ndirections. The view that the world could not exist\u2014even for a\nsecond\u2014without God, makes it wholly dependent on God and, hence,\nnot really an autonomous entity (Oakes 1983). Moreover, to further\ndevelop this argument, if God creates every temporal stage of every\nobject in the universe, this undermines the causal power of individual\nthings and leads to occasionalism, which in turn encourages pantheism;\nfor in so far as independent agency is a clear mark of independent\nbeing, the occasionalist doctrine that all genuine agency is\ndivine\u2014that it all comes from a single place\u2014tends to\nundermine the distinction of things from God. Both Malebranche and\nJonathan Edwards have found themselves charged with pantheism on these\ngrounds, and it was for this reason that Leibniz, in attempting to\nrefute the pantheistic monism of Spinoza, felt it most important to\nassert the autonomous agency of finite beings (Crisp 2019).\n\n(3) Alternatively it might be argued that God\u2019s\nomniscience is indistinguishable from reality itself. For if\nthere obtains a complete mapping between God\u2019s knowledge and the\nworld that God knows, what basis can be found for distinguishing\nbetween them, there being not even the possibility of a mismatch?\nMoreover, were we to separate the two, since knowledge tracks\nreality\u2014we know something because it is the case and not\nvice versa\u2014then God would become problematically\ndependent upon the world (Mander 2000).\n\n(4) Arguments of this general type may also proceed from starting\npoints more philosophical than theological. For example, Spinoza, the\nmost famous of all modern pantheists starts from the necessary\nexistence of something he calls \u2018substance.\u2019 By this he\nmeans that which exists wholly in its own right, that whose existence\ndoes not depend upon anything else. The notion of \u2018the\nAbsolute\u2019, or wholly unconditioned reality, as it figures in the\nphilosophies of Schelling, Hegel, and the British Idealists may be\nconsidered a related development of the same philosophical starting\npoint (see Thomas 2019). In both cases the reasoning runs that this\nnecessary being must be all-inclusive and, hence, divine.\n3. The logic of identity\n\nThe pantheist asserts an identity between God and nature, but it needs\nto be asked in just what sense we are to understand the term\n\u2018identity\u2019? To begin with it is necessary to raise two\nambiguities in the logic of identity.\n\n(1) Dialectical identity. It is important to note that many\npantheists will not accept the classical logic of identity in which\npairs are straightforwardly either identical or different. They may\nadopt rather the logic of relative identity, or\nidentity-in-difference, by which it is possible to maintain that God\nand the cosmos are simultaneously both identical and different, or to\nput the matter in more theological language, that God is\nsimultaneously both transcendent and immanent. For example, Eriugena\nholds that the universe may be subdivided into four categories: things\nwhich create but are not created, things which create and are created,\nthings which are created but do not create, and things which neither\ncreate nor are created. He argues that all four reduce to God, and\nhence \u201cthat God is in all things, i.e. that he subsists as their\nessence. For He alone by Himself truly has being, and He alone is\neverything which is truly said to be in things endowed with\nbeing\u201d (Periphyseon, 97). But nonetheless, for\nEriugena, the uncreated retains its distinct status separate from the\ncreated, not least in that the former may be understood while the\nlater transcends all understanding. In consequence, he insists that\nGod is not the genus of which creatures are the species. Similarly,\nthe Sufi philosopher, ibn \u2018Arabi identifies God and the\nuniverse, suggesting in a striking metaphor that the universe is the\nfood of God and God the food of the universe; as deity swallows up the\ncosmos so the cosmos swallows up deity (Bezels of Wisdom,\n237; Husaini 1970, 180). But Ibn \u2018Arabi in no sense regards such\nclaims as preventing him from insisting also on the fundamental gulf\nbetween the unknowable essence of God and his manifest being. We must\ndistinguish between the nature of God and the nature of things,\nbetween that which exists by itself (God) and that which exist by\nanother (the universe), but since the nature of God just is Being\nitself, no parallel distinction may be drawn between the being of God\nand the being of things. Nothing real exists besides God who discloses\nhimself in and through the universe (Chittick 1989, ch.5). Again,\nNicholas of Cusa\u2019s celebrated doctrine of the \u2018coincidence\nof opposites\u2019\u2014which he memorably illustrated by pointing\nto way in which, upon infinite expansion, a circle must coincide with\na straight line\u2014allows him to say both that God and the\ncreation are the same thing and that there exists a\nfundamental distinction between the realm of absolute being and the\nrealm of limited or contracted being (Moran 1990). Even Spinoza goes\nto great lengths to show that the two attributes of thought\nand extension by which we pick out the one substance as\n\u2018God\u2019 or \u2018nature\u2019 are nonetheless at the same\ntime irreducibly different. They may be co-referring but they are not\nsynonymous; indeed, they are utterly incommensurable. Such a\ndialectical conception of unity, in which there can be no identity\nwithout difference, is a strong element in Hegel\u2019s thought, and\nalso one aspect of what Hartshorne meant by dipolar theism;\nthe opposites of immanence and transcendence are included among those\nwhich he thinks God brings together in his being.\n\n(2) Partial Identity. Even accepting a classical conception\nof identity and difference, there remain issues to settle. If we think\nof pantheism negatively as a rejection of the view that God is\ndistinct from the cosmos, we would face four possible schemes by which\nwe might represent their mereological relation: we might understand\nGod as proper part of nature, we might take nature as a proper part of\nGod, we might regard the two domains as partially overlapping, or else\nwe might hold that they are strictly identical.\n\nReflecting upon the ambiguities of the previous two paragraphs, it\nmight be argued that only where we find strict classical identity do\nwe have pantheism. For if the universe is not wholly divine we have\nmere immanentism, while if God includes but is not exhausted\nby the universe then we have rather panentheism. Now,\ncertainly it may be allowed there are metaphysical schemes for which\nthe range of overlap between divinity and the cosmos is so small that\nthey fail to capture the spirit of pantheism. (For example, a\nworld-view in which God were understood as the vital spark which\nanimates an otherwise dead and motionless cosmos, or a world-view in\nwhich the cosmos were merely one small fraction of the being of God\nwould indeed seem far from the spirit of pantheism.) However, to limit\nthe term\u2019s application to just those schemes advancing strict\nclassical identity would be far too restrictive.\n\nSuch \u2018strict identity\u2019 is virtually impossible to define\ndue to the extreme difficulty of stipulating what would count as an\nacceptable and what as an unacceptable sense, part, aspect, or element\nof difference. For example, Aquinas distinguishes between the doctrine\nthat God is the form of all things (\u2018formal pantheism\u2019)\nand the doctrine that God is the matter of all things (\u2018material\npantheism\u2019) (Moran 1989, 86). Does either of these count as\npantheism \u2018proper\u2019, or must both obtain at the same time?\nAgain, while some pantheists conceive of deity in mereological terms\nas the collection of things which make up the universe, many others\nhave found this approach inadequate, maintaining that in some\nimportant sense \u2018the whole is greater than the sum of its\nparts.\u2019 The finite things that we encounter around us and are\nhappy enough to describe as parts of nature we feel less\nhappy to think of as parts of God. Such theorists may also\nreject the charge that their way of thinking is\npanentheistic, maintaining that the proper lesson to draw is\nnot one of the transcendence of the holistic view but rather one\nconcerning the degree of unreality or abstraction involved in any\ndistributed view. In short, does any admission of difference\nbetween the world as common-sense experiences it and the divine cosmos\nas pantheism understands it amount to a concession either that there\nare aspects of experience which fall outside deity or aspects of deity\nwhich fall outside experience? If so, then the class of \u2018true\npantheists\u2019 threatens to become null. In the end, rather than\nattempt to draw sharp but artificial and contentious lines it seems\nmore fruitful to maintain that the boundaries of demarcation between\nimmanence, pantheism, and panentheism are vague and porous.\n\nThis approach has the further advantage of keeping together\nhistorically cognate thinkers. If the essence of pantheism lies in\nstrict classical identity, the issue of who is or is not a pantheist\ncomes down to the somewhat arcane dispute whether there could be any\nconceivable aspect or side of reality which was not natural, and/or\nwhether there could be any conceivable aspect or side of reality which\nwas not divine, but these are abstruse points that can only take us\naway from the fundamental pantheistic intuition of the overlap of God\nand nature, the intuition that that in grasping the reality before us\nwe grasp God himself, not something separate or intermediary.\n4. Nature of the identity relation itself\n\nTo say that God is identical with the world as a whole is not\nself-explanatory and, although often the matter is left\ndisconcertingly vague, examination of the literature reveals a variety\nof different understandings of the identity relation being asserted\nhere.\n\n(1) Substance identity. For Spinoza the claim that God is the\nsame as the cosmos is spelled out as the thesis that there exists one\nand only one particular substance which he refers to as \u2018God or\nnature\u2019; the individual thing referred to as \u2018God\u2019\nis one and the same object as the complex unit referred to as\n\u2018nature\u2019 or \u2018the cosmos.\u2019 On such a scheme the\nfinite things of the world are thought of as something like\nparts of the one great substance, although the terminology of\nparts is somewhat problematic. Parts are relatively autonomous from\nthe whole and from each other, and Spinoza\u2019s preferred\nterminology of modes, which are to be understood as more like\nproperties, is chosen to rectify this. A further problem with the\nterminology of parts is that many pantheists have wanted to claim that\nGod or nature is not just the whole or totality of things, but is\nsomehow the inner essence or heart of each individual thing.\nThis may be expressed in the idea that somehow the whole is present in\neach of its parts, a suggestion whose meaning has often been left\nmetaphorical or obscure. Giordano Bruno, for example employs the two\nillustrations of a voice heard in its entirety from all sides of the\nroom, and that of a large mirror which reflects one image of one thing\nbut which, if it is broken into a thousand pieces, each of the pieces\nstill reflects the whole image (Bruno 1584, 50, 129). A thesis of the\ncomplete interpenetration or interrelation of everything, the claim\nbeing made here is related to that defended by Leibniz (who was not a\npantheist) that each monad is a mirror to the entire universe.\n\nIn Western philosophy Spinoza\u2019s formulation of the pantheistic\nposition has become so influential as to almost completely define the\nposition, but while practically all pantheists are monists (of some\nsort), not all are substance monists, and there do exist\nalternative ways of expressing identity besides a head-count of the\nnumber of particular entities.\n\n(2) Being itself. There is a long theological tradition in\nwhich God is regarded as being itself, rather than as one\nbeing among others, and insofar as it treats God as something to be\nfound inseparable from and at the very root of all that is, such a\nconception may be used to express pantheism. While a conceptual\ndistinction may be drawn between \u2018the totality of beings\u2019\nand \u2018being itself,\u2019 it is clear that neither of these\ncould have any reality except in and through the other. The\nidentification of God with being itself is a common Christian view,\nfrom Augustine to Tillich, but it is not exclusive to Christian\nthought. For example, Ibn \u2018Arabi, in developing the Koranic\nnotion of tawh\u012bd (God\u2019s unity), asserts that there\ncan be no real being other than God; that God permeates through all\nbeings and is essentially all things. Especially among his\nfollowers this was developed into a monistic ontology of wahdat\nal-wuj\u016bd (the unity of being).\n\n(3) Identity of origin. A third way to express the identity\nof God and nature is by reference to the thought that all things come\nfrom God, rendering them both identical with each other and with the\none source from which they came. It is important in this connection to\ndiscuss the difference between such notions as emanation, expression,\nor instantiation and the more specifically theistic conception of\ncreation ex nihilo, for given the plausibility of supposing\nthat what \u2018flows forth\u2019 or \u2018radiates out\u2019 from\na source is only latent within that stem, traditional theists have\noften insisted on creation ex nihilo precisely to drive a\nwedge between creator and created and thereby rule out pantheism. But\nalthough it would be tempting to contrast creation ex nihio\nas theistic and emanation as pantheistic, such thoughts are probably\ntoo simple. Plotinus\u2019 universe comprises in a hierarchy of\nemanations from what he terms, the \u2018One\u2019; but as neither\nanything in the cosmos nor the sum of all things in the cosmos, as an\nideal construction from which all expressions fall short,\nPlotinus\u2019 God is really too transcendent for his doctrine to\ncount as pantheism proper (see Steinhart 2019). Eriugena, by contrast,\nhas an emanation-theory that is more genuinely pantheist but, given\nhis apophatic conception of God as marked by both being and non-being,\nhe regards this position as wholly compatible with the doctrine of\ncreation ex nihilo. To Eriugena, God is precisely the nothing\nfrom which all things were made. Spinoza approaches the question of\norigin from a rather different angle. Arguing that God is the immanent\ncause of all things, he draws an important distinction between\nnatura naturans and natura naturata; between the\nuniverse considered in active mode as cause and the very same universe\nconsidered in passive mode as effect (Ethics 1p29s). This is\nan important doctrine not least for the way in which it links with\nnecessity. Modelled more on the way in which the theorems of geometry\nderive from its axioms than on the sense in which a work of art\nresults from the free or spontaneous activity of its artist,\npantheistic creation of this second type courts a determinism that\nthreatens to rule out free will. And that has been a very common\nobjection to pantheism.\n\n(4) Teleological Identity. Religious world views in which it\nis the ultimate destiny or purpose of the cosmos to achieve oneness\nwith or to fully express deity provide a fourth model for\nunderstanding pantheistic claims of identity. The true identity of the\nuniverse is that which is revealed at the end of all things. For\nexample, on the Absolute Idealist scheme, history culminates in the\ncomplete realization of God or Absolute spirit in the world and so, as\nSchelling put it, in the last days \u201cGod will indeed be all\nin all, and pantheism will be true\u201d (Schelling 1810, 484).\nA rather different example of this type of thinking is that of Samuel\nAlexander who thinks that the universe evolves in a steadily\nprogressive manner and will finally \u2018attain deity\u2019, where\ndeity is thought of as an unknown but superior quality that will\n\u2018emerge\u2019 from the complex whole in rather the same way as,\nat a lower level, consciousness \u2018emerges\u2019 from complex\norganisations of organic matter. By way of objection to such\nteleological conception of identity it might be challenged that\nsomething can only become merged with God, or become God, if it is\nnow different from God. But against this it could be replied\nthat, if the notion of teleology be taken seriously, a thing more\ntruly is what it is destined to become than what it\ncurrently seems to be, for everything about it is to be\nexplained in terms of its telos or goal. It may also be\nresponded that anything which can be converted into God\ncannot be finally different from God. Hence Alexander, for\nexample, is clear that since all potentiality must be grounded in some\nactuality there is also a sense in which the universe is already\nimplicitly God: \u201cGod as actually possessing deity does not exist\nbut is an ideal, is always becoming; but God as the whole universe\ntending towards deity does exist\u201d (Alexander 1921, 428).\n5. The unity of the cosmos\n\nAt least as usually understood the two terms \u2018nature\u2019 and\n\u2018God\u2019 have different and contrasting meanings. If they are\nidentified, it follows that one or both words are being used in a\ndifferent way than usual; that nature is more like God than commonly\nthought and/or that God is more like nature than commonly thought.\nWith respect to the cosmos this may be seen in the stress pantheists\ntypically put on the unity of the cosmos.\n\nA distinction may be drawn between distributive pantheism,\nthe view that each thing in the cosmos is divine, and collective\npantheism, the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine (Oppy\n1997). And if polytheism in general is coherent there is no reason in\nprinciple why we should exclude the possibility of a distributive\npantheism. But as in pursuit of explanatory unity and coherence belief\nin many Gods tends historically to give way to belief in single deity,\nwhile it would be technically possible to identify the universe with a\ncollection of deities, in practice monism tends to win out, and it has\nbeen characteristic of pantheists to stress heavily the unity of\nnature. Thus pantheism typically asserts a two-fold identity:\nas well as the unity of God and nature, it urges the unity of all\nthings with each other.\n\nIt may be asked whether a statement of the world\u2019s unity is a\nprecondition for asserting its identity with God, or a\nconsequence of asserting it? Is the intuition that the cosmos\nconstitutes a single integrated whole a contributory factor in\nthinking it divine, or (reflecting the traditional idea that God is\nunique and simple or without parts) is the intuition that it is divine\nthe reason for regarding it as such a unity?\n\nThe kind of unity which the pantheist thinks to find in nature can\nvary from a very strong metaphysical oneness, like that of Parmenides,\nwhich excludes all diversity or difference, to a much looser\nsystematic complex of distinct but inter-related elements, but the\nfour species of unity most commonly defended are: (1) the unity of all\nthat falls within the spatio-temporal continuum under a common set of\nphysical laws, (2) the reductive unity of a single material out of\nwhich all objects are made and within which no non-arbitrary divisions\ncan be made, (3) the unity of a living organism, or (4) the more\npsychological unity of a spirit, mind or person (see Cohoe 2020).\n6. The nature of the cosmos\n\nBesides commitment to the view that the cosmos as a whole is divine,\npantheists as a general class hold no specific theory about the\nnature of that cosmos. There are three main traditions.\n\n(1) Physicalism. Many pantheists argue that physical\nconceptions are adequate to explain the entire cosmos. This is an\nancient form of pantheism, found for example in the Stoics, for whom\nonly bodies can be said to exist. Soul they understood as nothing more\nthan a specific form of pneuma, or breath, the active power\nto be found throughout nature. This is also a form of pantheism\npopular today\u2014often termed, scientific or naturalistic\npantheism. Such worldviews make no ontological commitments beyond\nthose sanctioned by empirical science (Buckareff 2016,\nLancaster-Thomas 2020).\n\n(2) Idealism. During the nineteenth century, when pantheism\nwas at its most popular, the dominant form was idealist. According to\nAbsolute Idealism, as defended by such figures as Fichte, Schelling,\nHegel, and many of the British Idealists, all that exists is a single\nspiritual entity, of which the physical world must be understood as a\npartial manifestation. The search for that which may be asserted\nwithout condition or qualification leads to the conclusion that all\nvariety is the expression of an underlying unity, and that nothing can\nbe real in the absence of mind or spirit. On some versions of this\nsort of doctrine the physical world starts to look more like an\nappearance of the ultimate spiritual (or possibly unknown)\nreality beneath. Hegel himself rejects this sort of doctrine\n\u2014which he terms acosmism\u2014and while it certainly\namounts to a view that there exists nothing besides God, in view of\nits basic denial of the reality of the world we all experience it\nhardly seems like a kind of pantheism.\n\n(3) Dual-aspect theory. The pantheism of Spinoza is of\nneither these types. For Spinoza, there is one thing which expresses\nitself, or which may be understood, in two different ways, either as\nthinking substance or as extended substance. The principle difficulty\nof any such position is to further specify that ambiguous\nrelationship, whilst simultaneously avoiding the twin but opposed\npitfalls of reductionism and dualism.\n\nPantheists holds that whatever exists falls within God. This places\nthem in disagreement with any theory of the supernatural. But\nsuch opposition must not be misunderstood, for to say that there is no\nsupernatural realm is not in itself to delineate the range of what is\nnatural. This is important, for while many contemporary pantheists\nhave been epistemologically conservative, there is no reason in\nprinciple why the pantheist should oppose the idea of that which\nis epistemically transcendent to us, no reason (that is) why he should\nseek to limit the compass of the universe to the known\nuniverse. For example, Spinoza held, not only that the realms of\nthought and extension must stretch indefinitely beyond our finite\ngrasp, but that, as well as in the two known realms of thought and\nextension, the one substance must exist also in an infinity of other\ndimensions completely beyond our power to conceive.\n7. The divinity of the cosmos\n\nOne of the strongest and most commonly raised objections to pantheism\nis that it is simply inappropriate to call the universe\n\u2018God\u2019. Thus Schopenhauer complains that \u201cPantheism\nis only a euphemism for atheism,\u201d for \u201cto call the world\nGod is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a\nsuperfluous synonym for the word world\u201d (Schopenhauer 1851,\nI:114, II:99). It has been described as nothing more than\n\u2018materialism grown sentimental\u2019 (Illingworth 1898, 69),\nwhile more recently Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion\ncomplains that \u201cPantheism is sexed-up Atheism\u201d (Dawkins\n2007, 40). It is clear that the more naturalistically the cosmos is\nconceived the stronger that objection must seem, but to estimate more\ncarefully its validity the following six sections take in turn a\nnumber of characteristics which the cosmos possesses or might possess\nand which could be thought to make it divine. We may proceed from the\nleast to the most contested, noting that not all pantheists will agree\non all marks.\n8. Evoking religious emotion\n\nMost straightforwardly it has been maintained that the One is holy\nbecause we feel a particular set of religious emotions towards it\n(Levine 1994, ch.2.2). For Rudolf Otto (1917), whatever is holy or\n\u2018numinous\u2019 is so characterised on the basis of our\nnon-rational, non-sensory experience of it rather than its own\nobjective features and, taking its departure from Otto\u2019s work,\none approach has been to argue that the feelings of awe which people\nfeel towards God can be, and often are, applied to the universe\nitself (Byerly 2019). Whether it is really possible, or appropriate,\nto entertain such feelings towards the cosmos as a whole will be\ndiscussed below, but the chief point to make here concerns the extreme\nsubjectivism of this response; it\u2019s coming to rest upon feelings\nwhich, while sincere enough, indicate nothing whatsoever about the\nuniverse itself. On this view, all that distinguishes a pantheist from\nan atheist is feeling; a certain emotional reaction or\nconnection that we feel to the universe. It would become akin, say, to\nthe difference between one who loves art and another who is relatively\nindifferent to it. Prima facie, however, this approach puts\nthe cart before the horse; rather than say that the One is divine\nbecause we feel a set of religious emotions towards it, it seems more\nappropriate to suppose that we feel those emotions towards it because\nwe think it is divine.\n9. A place in the universe at large\n\nReligion gives meaning to human lives by assigning them a certain\ndefinite place within a grander scheme or narrative. It gives its\nadherents a sense of their part in a coherent universe. It tells us\nthat the universe is not a random conjunction of brute facts, but a\nwhole in which we have our proper location. The pantheist may regard\nthe cosmos as divine for very similar reasons. To think of oneself as\npart of a vast interconnected scheme may give one a sense of being\n\u2018at home in the universe.\u2019 Here ecological thinking may\ncome to the fore; like the individual creatures in a complex\necosystem, small but vital contributors to a larger whole, we too may\nbe thought to have our place in the connected whole that is\nNature.\n10. The infinity / eternity / necessity of the universe\n\nHistorically the majority of pantheists have regarded the universe as\nInfinite, metaphysically perfect, necessarily existent, and eternal\n(or some subset thereof) and\u2014taking these attributes as the\ncharacteristic marks of divinity\u2014that has formed one very\nimportant reason for thinking that the universe itself is in fact\nGod.\n\nIn more recent times, however, there have arisen naturalistic or\nscientific forms of pantheism which reject or are neutral about these\ncharacteristics and, while they remove one important set of reasons\nfor thinking the cosmos divine, so long as others remain, the\namputation in itself seems insufficient reason to refuse the label\n\u2018pantheist\u2019 to such views. Any methodology which limits\nitself to empirical science will presumably find it hard to attribute\nanything like infinitude or necessary existence to the cosmos, while\napproaches which do find a role for such features will need to be\ncareful that they understand them in an appropriate fashion. (For\nexample, it is doubtful that mere infinite extent, or infinite\ndivisibility, in space and time would be sufficient to merit that the\nuniverse be called divine.) But with these caveats aside the pantheist\nis not without arguments for believing that the universe as a whole\ndisplays marks of metaphysical perfection.\n\nThe earliest arguments for such a view are to be found in the\npre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander who held that the universe\nemerges from what he termed \u2018to apeiron,\u2019 a\ncomplex notion which may be rendered as the infinite, the boundless or\nthe indefinite. Anaximander\u2019s thought seems to have been that\nthe ground by which all qualitative characteristics are explained must\nitself lack any determination. Insofar as we can construct his\nreasons, he argued that some such boundless potentiality was need to\nensure the continual coming to be and passing away in the world that\ncharacterises the passing of time. As something thus immortal and\nindestructible, Anaximander concluded that the infinite was also\ndivine (Aristotle, Physics, 203b).\n\nIt is notable that much of the same reasoning that theists employ in\nthe Kalaam cosmological argument for the existence of God may be used\nfor the universe itself. If we inquire into the origin of the\nuniverse, it may be suggested (1) that it simply began without reason,\n(2) that it was somehow self-creating, or (3) that its origin requires\na prior cause which in turn calls for an infinite causal chain. Each\nof these answers has sufficient problems such that one might well\nprefer to argue instead, (4) that the universe in fact exists\nnecessarily.\n\nBut perhaps the most commonly used argument among pantheists has been\nthe ontological argument. As employed by classical theism this line of\nargument has been much criticised, but the forms in which it has been\nput forward by pantheists (such as Spinoza and Hegel) are\ninterestingly different. On their way of thinking, the more perfect an\nidea becomes the less room there remains for any gap between it and\nits instantiation, but no idea becomes perfect simply by defining\nitself to be so. This can be shown only by a full development of its\ncontent amounting to nothing less than a complete philosophical system\n(Harrelson 2009).\n11. Ineffable\n\nA fourth feature commonly taken to mark the divinity of God is his\nineffability. If he is so much greater than anything else, anything we\nsay of him would limit or falsify him, so we can speak at best in\nnegatives, or simply conclude that he is an ineffable mystery. It\nwould be hard to think of a line of reasoning less congenial to the\nrationalist spirit that has characterised many pantheists, for example\nscientific pantheism.\n\nAt the same time it must be allowed that there is a strong apophatic\nstreak in much pantheism. In contrast to his teacher, Thales, who\nthought it possible to specify the ground of all things as water, for\nAnaximander the one source from which cosmos comes forth (to\napeiron) is construed precisely in terms of its resistance to any\ndeterminate characterisation, while both Eriugena and Ibn \u2018Arabi\nstress that although the God of which we can speak is identical with\nthe cosmos, there remains another sense in which we cannot speak of\nGod at all. The essence of God considered in himself, the universal\nground of being cannot itself be captured by any of the limited\ncategories which flow out from it. Even Spinoza suggests that the\nhighest stages of knowledge consist in a form of intuitive insight,\nwhich transcends mere reasoning or conceptual knowledge in that it\nenables us to grasp the essence of individual things. Part of what he\ncalls \u2018the intellectual love of God\u2019, such scientia\nintuitiva is itself assigned a salvific role in Spinoza\u2019s\nthought; it is the path to human blessedness.\n12. Personal\n\nEinstein was a pantheist but rejected any notion of a personal God\n(Einstein 2010, 325). And like Einstein, for many pantheists rejection\nof a personal deity is the definitive mark or most important element\nof their position (Levine 1994; Harrison 2013). However, the matter\ncalls for more considered attention.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the specific question of\nwhether God is literally a \u2018person\u2019 and the more general\nquestion whether God is \u2018person-like\u2019; the issue of\nwhether notions such as intellect, thought, consciousness, intent,\netc. have any application to the divine, even if analogical or\nmetaphorical. It should also be recognised both that the notion of\npersonhood is itself deeply problematic, and that a not inconsiderable\nnumber of traditional theists would only with considerable\nqualification be prepared to allow that God is personal.\n\nThese points made, while it is true that traditional theism has\nregularly opposed pantheism on the grounds that it tends to be\nimpersonal, and true also that many pantheists would deny that God is\npersonal, it is nonetheless the case that many other pantheists have\nthought mind-like attribution of some form or other to the cosmos\nabsolutely central to their position (Bishop & Perszyk 2017; Hewitt\n2019; Mander 2022, 2017).\n\nIt is clear that pantheistic systems which start from the theistic God\nwhich they then find to be all-inclusive, or Absolute Idealist systems\nwhich derive all reality from a spiritual principle, will find it\neasier to attribute something like personhood to the cosmos than will\nthose which are more naturalistically motivated. But it is important\nto realise that not even the latter are wholly resistant to\npersonhood.\n\nFor example, it has been argued (Baltzly 2003) that the Stoics\nbelieved in a personal deity. Just as they construed human beings as\nphysical creatures animated by a physical soul, so too they regarded\nGod as the mind of the world\u2014with the cosmos as his body. Like a\nvast biological individual, to them God was a conscious rational\nbeing, exercising providence over life and to whom we might approach\nin prayer.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s God is an \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d,\n(Ethics 2p11c) all knowing, (2p3) and capable of loving both\nhimself\u2014and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection\n(5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards\nwhich we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too\nthat Spinoza recommends amor intellectualist dei (the\nintellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However,\nthe matter is complex. Spinoza\u2019s God does not have free will\n(1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1appendix), and\nSpinoza insists that \u201cneither intellect nor will pertain to the\nnature of God\u201d (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we\nneed to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could\never love us back. \u201cHe who loves God cannot strive that God\nshould love him in return,\u201d says Spinoza (5p19).\n\nAnother notable pantheist to insist that the supreme being is personal\nwas Gustav Fechner, who develops a form of panpsychism according to\nwhich all organised matter must be thought of as possessing its own\ninner life or soul. The more complex and developed its structure, the\nmore sophisticated its spiritual life; from the lowest soul-life of\nplants, through our own mental life, which is just the inner side of\nour bodies, through the soul-life of the planets and stars up to the\nmost developed spirit of all, God, the consciousness which corresponds\nto the most complex organism there is, the cosmos itself. More\nrecently, a very similar view has been put forward by Timothy Sprigge\nwho maintains that that the only conceivable form of reality consists\nin streams of experience, such as we know ourselves to be, all of\nwhich must be thought of as included together within a single\nall-embracing experience; which we may call God or the Absolute.\nSprigge, however, is more cautious than Fechner insofar as he declines\nto identify any physical systems other than those of animals\n(including human beings) that can confidently be said to possess their\nown inner conscious life (Sprigge 2006, ch.9). Against the idea that\nGod is some type of all-embracing spirit or person it is often\ncomplained that this would undermine the autonomous personhood of\nfinite individuals; for can one person be part of another?\nFechner suggests as a model for understanding this the way in which\nour different sense modalities (sight, smell, touch, etc), each\ninaccessible to each other, combine together into one unified\nconsciousness (Fechner 1946, 144). While to extend such a model beyond\nthe merely receptive to the active aspects of personhood, we might\nthink of the way in which the agency of an organisation is exercised\nthrough the agency of its individual members. Here several pantheists\nhave been influenced by Christian ideas of the indwelling spirit of\nGod at work within the body of the Church.\n13. Value\n\nSixthly (and perhaps most importantly of all) it is widely thought\nthat the most important thing about God\u2014thing that most makes us\ncall him \u2018God\u2019\u2014is his perfection or goodness. God is\na being \u2018worthy of worship.\u2019 Can the pantheist say this of\nthe cosmos as a whole? A variety of positions are possible. (1) Any\npantheistic world-view arrived at by extending the reach of the\ntraditional theistic God will find it relatively easy to assert the\nsame value to the cosmos that it attributed to God, but there are\nother possibilities as well. (2) Insofar as the pantheist assertion of\nunity may be understood as an assertion of complete and coherent\nintegration, and disvalue held to lie in conflict, disharmony or\nincompleteness, then it may be possible to argue that the culmination\nof metaphysical unity constitutes also the culmination of value. For\nexample, the Absolute Idealist Bernard Bosanquet states, \u201cWe\ncannot describe perfection; that is, we cannot enumerate its\ncomponents and state their form and connection in detail. But we can\ndefine its character as the harmony of all being. And good is\nperfection in its character of satisfactoriness; that which is\nconsidered as the end of conations and the fruition of desires\u201d\n(Bosanquet 1913,194). (3) More naturalistically, it might be suggested\nthan pantheism tells us that nature is our proper home and, as such,\nour proper good. Everything has its place in a wider system which both\nsupports it and to which it contributes. As natural creatures our most\nfulfilling life is found in and at one with nature. (4) Lastly, it\nshould be noted that many scientific pantheists argue that nature has\nno intrinsic value whatsoever. It is merely something that\nwe happen to love and venerate in the highest degree.\n14. Pantheism and the Problem of Evil\n\nHistorically one of the strongest and most persistent objections to\npantheism is that, because of its all-encompassing nature, it seems\ninhospitable to the differentiations of value that characterise life.\nIn what might be thought of as a pantheistic version of the problem of\nevil, it is challenged that if God includes everything and God is\nperfect or good, then everything which exists ought to be perfect or\ngood; a conclusion which seems wholly counter to our common experience\nthat much in the world is very far from being so. Or to put the\nargument slightly differently, if whatever we do or however things\nturn out must be deemed the action of God, how can our pantheistic\nbelief demand of us any specific duty? The only alternative\nconclusion, if we wish to hold on to the difference between what is\ngood and what is bad, would seem to be equally unattractive claim that\na universe containing both values, in itself\npossesses neither; the pantheistic deity in its own being\nlies beyond good and evil.\n\nTo point out that classical theism faces its own difficulties over\nevil and God\u2019s providence, while it may level the playing field,\ndoes nothing in itself to help solve the puzzle, and pantheists\nthemselves have suggested a variety of explanations or theodicies. (1)\nThe most popular model for dealing with evil is found in the\nphilosophy of Spinoza who regards both error and evil as distortions\nthat result from the fragmentary view of finite creatures; phenomena\nreal enough to the finite beings who experience them but which would\ndisappear in the widest and final vision of God. In this he was, of\ncourse, developing the Stoic sense that if we could see the world as\nGod does, as the perfectly harmonious embodiment of the\nlogos, we would recognise how its apparent defects in fact\ncontribute to the goodness of the whole. (2) It may be responded also\nthat the objection that pantheism councils moral indifference is based\non a modal confusion, comparable to that made by the proponent of\nlogical determinism. If pantheism amounts to a doctrine of providence,\nit is true that what actually happens will be for the best, but it\ncertainly does not follow from that that whatever else might\nhave happened would have been for the best, and it\npossible that part at least of the perfection of the cosmos comes\nabout through our own individual moral choices.\n15. Pantheism and the distribution of value\n\nAlthough not all pantheists ascribe intrinsic value to the cosmos as a\nwhole, insofar as they do, that might be thought give rise to\nsomething of a puzzle. For if God is valuable and God is identical to\nthe universe then we might seem committed to the somewhat implausible\nthought that everything in the universe is equally valuable;\na leveling off which gave rise to Coleridge\u2019s complaint that\n\u2018everything God\u2019 and \u2018no God\u2019 are in effect\nidentical positions (Coleridge 1839, 224). The pantheist need not be\ncommitted to this view, however, for the fact that a certain feature\nor element is present in everything by no means entails that it is\nequally present in everything. Although the universe as a\nwhole may be divine, there is no need to regard each bit of it as\nuniformly divine; no need (for example) to feel quite the same about\nthe loss of biological species as we do about the disappearance of\nhuman cultures and languages. Historically, there have been two main\nways in which pantheists have regarded the distribution of value in\nthe universe.\n\n(1) Emphasis on nature. Most typically pantheism is\ncharacterized by deep love and reverence for the natural world insofar\nas it exists independently of human culture or civilization. The\npantheist finds God more in the waterfall or the rainforest than in\nthe car park or the gasworks. From the romantic period onwards this is\na very strong drive in both literary and popular pantheism, with urban\nand technological life regarded as at best a kind of self-interested\nanthropocentric distortion of true value and at worst even a kind of\nloss or separation from divinity.\n\nIf uncultivated nature is divine then the pantheist may legitimately\nconclude that it should be treated with respect, even as sacred. Such\nis the import of Aldo Leopold\u2019s \u2018land ethic\u2019 (1949)\nor the \u2018deep ecology\u2019 of Arne N\u00e6ss (1973), and many\nmodern pantheists have developed close connections with\nenvironmentalism. But neither the import nor the justification of such\nideas are straightforward. It might be suggested that as no one person\nought to put their own interests before another, neither ought any\nspecies to put itself ahead of another, nor the sentient ahead of the\ninsentient, nor the living ahead of the non-living. But with each\nfurther step this argument becomes harder to press, due to the extreme\ndifficulty of identifying\u2014and weighing\u2014such potentially\nconflicting interests. For example, unless the pantheist is some sort\nof panpsychist, he will not regard natural objects such as rivers or\nmountains as possessing sentience, purpose or interests of its own;\nwhich means that treating them with respect cannot be modelled on what\nit means to treat people or animals with respect (see Leidenhag\n2018).\n\n(2) Emphasis on humanity. A second and very different model\nfor understanding the relationship between divinity and value\nmaintains that God is most revealed in human culture and history. For\nthe Stoics, Reason or logos\u2014the essence of the\nworld\u2014though it underlies all things, is more strongly manifest\nin some (such as human life) than in others, while the virtues of\nstoic detachment and self-sufficiency preclude our true good being\nheld hostage to the state of anything external to ourselves, such as\nnature. This pair of attitudes is summed up in Cicero\u2019s\nnotorious assertion that all things were made for either Gods or men\n(Holland 1997, Baltzly 2003). But probably the best illustration of\nthis more anthropocentric way of thinking about value is the Hegelian\nsystem, in which Geist \u2014the spirit whose manifestation\nis the universe\u2014articulates itself in a developmental\nsequence of increasingly adequate expressions (which may or may not\nalso be temporal) up from the most basic abstractions of merely\nphysical nature, through the organic realm, up to its apex in the\nconcrete details of social and cultural life. The beauties of nature\nare valued as an approximation to those of art, and the development of\nethical life (Sittlichkeit) is literally \u201cthe march of\nGod in the world\u201d (Hegel 1821, 247).\n16. Pantheism and ethics\n\nIf, as we have suggested, there is room for value in pantheism then\nthere is room for ethics. But does pantheism prescribe any specific\nethics? There are two respects in which pantheism might be thought to\nhave significant ethical implications.\n\nFirstly, for pantheism, there is no higher power, no external\nauthority to tell us what to do. Insofar as it rejects any sense of a\ntranscendent external lawgiver or\u2014to put the matter more\npositively\u2014insofar as it regards deity as the distributed\npossession of all, pantheism may be represented as endorsing the\nKantian doctrine of the autonomy of ethical judgement. But the\nimplications of this are open. It can lead to either democratic\ncommunitarian ethics or to individualism. Paradoxically, it might\nequally well result in a species of conservative conformity to\nwhatever is deemed to be the \u2018natural state\u2019 of the world\nevery bit as stifling to the human spirit as conformity to whatever is\ndeemed to be \u2018the will of God.\u2019\n\nSecondly, it may be argued that pantheism is able to give a\nparticularly strong ground for an ethic of altruism or compassion. To\nSchopenhauer (with whom this argument is particularly associated) only\ngenuinely altruistic or compassionate actions have moral worth, but\nonly pleasure and pain are capable of motivating the will, from which\nhe concludes that genuinely moral action is possible only if the\npleasure and pain of others can stir us to action as directly and\nimmediately as can our own pleasure and pain. It is not enough that we\nsympathetically imagine ourselves in their shoes, he argues; we must\nliterally feel the pleasure and pain of others as our own, an attitude\nthat will be rationally grounded only in a monistic metaphysics in\nwhich the distinction between ego and not ego becomes a trivial or\nillusory distinction between two manifestations of the same underlying\nunity (Schopenhauer 1839). Schopenhauer includes nonhuman animals in\nthis argument. To the charge that what is defended here remains but a\nspecies of egoism\u2014metaphysically enlarged, but still morally\nworthless\u2014it may be replied that self-concern is to be\ndeprecated only insofar as it is something that exists in contrast\nwith concern for others (a contrast which no longer finds any purchase\nin this scheme).\n17. Pantheism and religion\n\nReligion is a form of life, not a philosophical theory. Thus theism is\nnot itself a religion, although it lies at the core of many religions,\nand neither is pantheism itself a religion, although a core of\npantheistic belief has unquestionably grounded the religion of many\npeople.\n\nNo doubt many pantheists self-consciously and deliberately reject\ntheism, while many theists strongly reject pantheism. But to conclude\nfrom this that pantheism should be understood as essentially\nopposed to theism would seem precipitous (like concluding mutual\nincompatibility from the fact that many Christians oppose socialism\nand many socialists oppose Christianity). Without being drawn into\ndoctrinal questions well outside the purview of this essay, two points\nmay be made. Many philosophers who have put forward pantheist beliefs\nhave thought there was no need for anyone who accepted them to abandon\ntraditional religion (for example, Spinoza, Hegel, or Edward\nCaird\u2014who argues that \u201cthe religious consciousness is not\nthe consciousness of another object than that which is present in\nfinite experience and science, but simply a higher way of knowing the\nsame object,\u201d (1892, 464) but whom nonetheless considered\nhimself Christian.) From the other side, many committed theologians\nhave advanced positions with deeply pantheistic implications (e.g. the\n\u2018Christian Pantheism\u2019 of Teilhard de Chardin or the\n\u2018Ethical Pantheism\u2019 of Albert Schweitzer.)\n\nIt is sometimes objected that pantheism cannot really be religious on\nthe grounds that it can make no sense to direct at the cosmos\nthe religious attitudes and emotions\u2014worship, love,\ngratitude\u2014which are more normally directed towards a\nperson (Levine 1994, 315). (This is, of course, to assume that\nthe pantheistic God is not personal; a claim which, as we\nhave seen, many pantheists would reject.) Worship is commonly an\nexpression of dependence on a personal creator God, but, even if we\ndon\u2019t approve of their doing so, people worship many other\nthings, such as money, fashion, the State, or idols, without\nnecessarily assuming that these have residing within them some\nconscious spirit or other. Love is more usually felt towards people,\nbut Wordsworth described himself as a \u2018lover of nature\u2019\n(Tintern Abbey; see Hoque 2014), while Byron thought it\npossible to love his country but not his countrymen (Byron 1854, 25).\nWe typically thank a person, but it is possible also to feel gratitude\nwhich transcends any feeling to particular individuals to an\ninstitution (such as a college, community, or even State) which has\nnurtured you. In each case there remains room for doubt whether these\nattitudes are really equivalent to the sort of emotions more typically\nassociated with religion, but equally it is hard to see on what\nlegitimate grounds emotions might excluded from consideration as\n\u2018not properly religious.\u2019\n\nIn most religions prayer is not simply the expression of worship,\nlove, and gratitude, but an act in which we petition the deity for\nintercession. We can petition the theistic God, but can we petition\nthe universe itself? Most pantheists have thought not, but where the\ncosmos is conceived as personal, or at least moral, room may exist to\ndevelop such ideas. Construing the entire universe as a conscious\nbeing, Fechner argues that it makes perfect sense to petition it; the\nonly difference being that normal requests must be expressed since the\nobject to which they are directed lies outside of us, but in the case\nof God this is unnecessary since we exist already within him (Fechner\n1946, 242\u20136). Even if not personal, so long as it could be said\nthat the universe exhibits a moral narrative structure there is no\nreason to insist that that structure be independent of the moral needs\nor requests of creatures within it (Mander 2007).\n\nA common mark of religion is its soteriological character, its\nrecognition that the human condition is somehow unsatisfactory or\n\u2018fallen\u2019 and its offer to overcome this state through a\nprocess of human transformation, be the result of that renovation\nenduring happiness or some more elevated state of blessedness or\nnirvana. Can pantheism respond to this? Can it offer the\nbeliever hope for a better life?\n\nIf all that is hoped for is the well-being that comes from a more\nethical mode of existence, then pantheism is perfectly able to offer\nthis, supporting a value system which eschews selfishness in favour of\na wider concern. For example the American poet Robinson Jeffers\nsuggests that \u201cthere is peace, freedom, I might say a kind of\nsalvation, in turnings one\u2019s affections outwards towards this\none God, rather than inwards on one\u2019s self, or on\nhumanity\u201d (Jeffers 2009, 365) But some other pantheists have\nsought to offer something further. Pantheist systems with a\nteleological structure (such as those discussed in Section Four above)\nreadily lend themselves to soteriology on a grand scale; for example,\nwhile to Spinoza the highest state of human happiness consists in the\nintellectual love of God (a state not dissimilar to the Beatific\nVision), Hegel outlines a developmental scheme whose climax consists\nin the full and explicit self-manifestation of God.\n\nIn many traditional religions salvation has been linked to\nimmortality. Against this, it has been common among pantheists to\nargue that what is distinctive about pantheism is precisely its\ndisavowal of any hope for personal immortality. However, some have\nargued that a measure of endurance may be found in so far as we\nrecognize our real identity with, either the eternal universe (for\nexample, Schopenhauer 1851, 267\u201382) or, perhaps more\nspecifically with the ongoing life of our community (for example, John\nCaird 1880). A small number of pantheistic thinkers have attempted to\ndevelop more genuinely personal senses of immortality. For example,\nSpinoza controversially claims that \u201cThe human mind cannot be\nabsolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains which\nis eternal\u201d (Ethics e5p23). Josiah Royce, in his early\nAbsolute Idealist phase, attempted to argue that if our finite will,\nwhich in this life is never quite satisfied, is itself but a part of a\ngreater infinite will that is eternally satisfied, then that can only\nmean that we must find our share of that satisfaction \u201cin a life\nthat is not this present mortal life\u201d (Royce 1906, 147).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aranyosi, Istv\u00e1n, 2022, \u2018Logical Pantheism,\u2019\n<em>Philosophy Compass</em>, 17(7): e12857.\ndoi:10.1111/phc3.12857", "Alexander, S., 1921, \u2018Some Explanations\u2019\n<em>Mind</em>, 30(120): 409\u201328.", "Aristotle, <em>Physics</em>, translated by Robin Waterfield with\nan introduction by David Bostock, Oxford: Oxford World\u2019s\nClassics, 1996.", "Baltzly, D., 2003, \u2018Stoic Pantheism,\u2019 <em>Sophia</em>,\n42(2): 3\u201334.", "Bishop, J. and Perszyk, K., 2017, \u2018The Divine Attributes and\nNon-Personal Conceptions of God,\u2019 <em>Topoi</em>, 36(4):\n609\u201321.", "Bosanquet, B., 1913, <em>The Value and Destiny of the\nIndividual</em>, London: Macmillan.", "Bruno, G., 1584, <em>Cause, Principle and Unity</em>, edited and\ntranslated by R. de Lucca and R.J.Blackwell, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1998.", "Buckareff, A.A., 2016, \u2018Pantheism and \u201cSaving\nGod\u201d\u2009\u2019 <em>Sophia: International Journal for\nPhilosophy of Religion, Metaphysical Theology and Ethics</em>, 55(3):\n347\u2013355.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2022, <em>Pantheism</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "Buckareff, A.A. and Nagasawa, Y.
