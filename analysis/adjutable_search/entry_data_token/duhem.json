Life and Works\n\n\nPierre Maurice Marie Duhem was born on June 10, 1861, in Paris, in a\nmodest neighborhood on the Rue des Je\u00fbneurs, near the Grands\nBoulevards, just South of Montmartre. His father, Pierre-Joseph Duhem,\nwas of Flemish origin, the oldest child of a large family who lived in\nthe French northern industrial city of Roubaix, near the Belgian\nborder. After the death of his parents, Pierre-Joseph was forced to\ndiscontinue his studies with the Jesuits in order to provide for the\nfamily. He worked in the textile industry as a sales representative,\nbut never abandoned his love of learning; it is said that, late in\nlife, he was seen everywhere with the work of a Latin author under his\narm. Pierre Duhem\u2019s mother, Marie-Alexandrine Fabre, descended on\nher mother\u2019s side from the Hubault-Delormes, a bourgeois family\nwho had settled in Paris during the seventeenth century. Her\nfather\u2019s family had originally come from the southern town of\nCabesprine, near Carcasonne, and it was there, in a house they still\nmaintained and to which Pierre returned most summers, that he died on\nSeptember 14, 1916.\n\n\nThe Duhems made sure that Pierre was well educated. Starting at the\nage of seven he was given private lessons with a small group of\nstudents, on grammar, arithmetic, Latin, and catechism. A letter he\nwrote about the siege of Chateaudun he experienced in October 1870\nattests to his being already a literate writer by the age of nine. The\nyoung Duhem was witness to some troubling times, with the\nFranco-Prussian War raging until the armistice in February 1871 and the\nParis Commune in March. The Duhems had avoided the advance of the\nPrussians against Paris but were caught up in the siege of Chateaudun;\nthey barely escaped to Bordeaux, returning to Paris after the armistice\nand just before the Paris Commune. That social experiment lasted only\ntwo months, though it set the stage for some wide-ranging\ntransformations to French culture that were to have great consequences\nwhen they were later established permanently. Among the Commune\u2019s\ndecrees were the separation of church from state, the rendering of all\nchurch property into public property, and the exclusion of religion\nfrom schools. The Duhems did not approve of these measures and were\nparticularly chagrined by some of the extreme actions taken by the most\nradical elements of the Commune, such as the desecration of churches\nand graveyards. For the Duhems, the Commune was a paradigm of anarchy\nand irreligion.\n\n\nThe Fall of 1872 brought two great tragedies to the Duhem family: a\ndiphtheria epidemic killed Pierre\u2019s younger sister Antoinette and\nhis recently born brother Jean, leaving only Pierre and\nAntoinette\u2019s twin sister Marie. Pierre continued his education\n(as demi-pensionnaire) at a Catholic school, the\nColl\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris, in 1872 and for the next ten years.\nThe mature Duhem recalled his college days as most formative. In\nparticular, he singled out his science teacher as an important\ninfluence:\n\n\nLet us return to some twenty-five years back to the time when we\nreceived our first initiation as a physicist in the mathematics classes\nof the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas. The person who gave us this\ninitiation, Jules Moutier, was an ingenious theorist; his critical\nsense, ever aware and extremely perspicacious, distinguished with sure\naccuracy the weak point of many a system that others accepted without\ndispute; proofs of his inquiring mind are not lacking, and physical\nchemistry owes him one of its most important laws. It was this teacher\nwho planted in us our admiration for physical theory and the desire to\ncontribute to its progress. \u2026 Being a disciple of Moutier, it\nwas as a convinced partisan of mechanism that we approached the courses\nin physics pursued at the Ecole Normale. (1914, 417\u201318; 1954,\n275\u201376.)\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s science teacher Jules Moutier went on to teach at the\nEcole Polytechnique and to publish a number of texts, including La\nthermodynamique et ses principales applications (Paris:\nGauthier-Villars, 1885). Duhem recognized in his theory of chemical\ndissociation and in his thermodynamics generally a first enunciation of\nthe chemical theories that Josiah Willard Gibbs, an important later\ninfluence on Duhem, was to develop more fully.\n\n\nIn 1882 Duhem enrolled at the prestigious secular institution of higher\neducation, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. When he entered the\nEcole Normale he was first in his class in the Science Section, out of\nthe approximately 30 students chosen from the best 800 or so graduates\nin France that year, and he remained first throughout his years there.\nThe curriculum at the Ecole Normale usually lasted three years; Duhem\nwas granted a fourth year and stayed on a fifth year as\nagr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur. He received a\nlicense in mathematics and another in physics at the end of\nacademic year 1883\u201384. In his final year, Duhem was offered a position\nin Louis Pasteur\u2019s laboratory as a chemist-bacteriologist, though\nhe refused it because of his desire to work in theoretical physics.\n\n\nOne of the turning points in Duhem\u2019s career occurred during\nacademic year 1884\u201385, while he was only a third-year student. Duhem\npresented a thesis in physics for his doctorate. The thesis, on\nthermodynamic potential, Le potentiel thermodynamique et ses\napplications \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique chimique et \u00e0\nl\u2019\u00e9tude des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\n\u00e9lectriques, was rejected by a panel composed of three\nscholars: the physicist Gabriel Lippmann and the mathematicians Charles\nHermite and Emile Picard. The panel, chaired by Lippmann, seems to have\nmade a political decision. The prestigious French scientific publisher,\nHermann, published a version of the thesis the following year. Duhem\ndefended another thesis in applied mathematics, on the theory of\nmagnetization by induction, Sur l\u2019aimantation par\ninfluence, and received his doctorate in October 1888; this time,\nthe physicist Edmond Bouty, the mathematician Gaston Darboux, and the\nmathematician-physicist Henri Poincar\u00e9 constituted the panel\nthat accepted the dissertation. It would be difficult to understand\nfully these events without delving deeply into the social, cultural,\nand intellectual context of France at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. At a time when French scientists were predominantly liberal\nand anti-clerical, Duhem was openly conservative and deeply religious;\nhe was also stubborn and often contentious. The structure of French\nacademia was surely also a factor in the affair. However, the specific\nmotives generally cited in the case were Lipmann\u2019s\n\u201cjealousy\u201d and the fact that Duhem\u2019s thesis refuted\nthe principle of maximum work: that chemical changes tend spontaneously\nto produce maximum heat. It was one of the cherished theses of Marcellin\nBerthelot, Lippmann\u2019s friend and a significant power in the\nFrench scientific establishment. It was reported that Berthelot had\nsaid: \u201cThis young man will never teach in Paris.\u201d\nBerthelot\u2019s edict came true. Duhem spent his academic career in\nprovincial universities far from Paris, the center of academic life in\nFrance. His teaching positions brought him from Lille, then briefly to\nRennes, then to Bordeaux for the remainder of his life, but never to\nParis.\n\n\nDuhem assumed the position of Maitre de Conf\u00e9rences at the\nFacult\u00e9 des Sciences at Lille in October 1887. There he met\nAd\u00e8le Chayet, whom he married in October 1890. Their daughter\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne was born in September 1891. Tragically,\nAd\u00e8le died in childbirth the following summer; the newborn\nchild also did not survive. Duhem never remarried. He left the\nupbringing of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to his mother who lived with him\nafter his father Pierre-Joseph died. The situation in Lille soured for\nDuhem. Never one to back off from a dispute, he fought with the Dean\nof his faculty over a minor issue: an assistant had failed to unlock\nthe door of Duhem\u2019s laboratory for his students during their\nlicentiate examinations. The assistant complained about his\nmistreatment by Duhem to the Dean, who requested that the assistant\nwrite a letter of apology; Duhem rejected the apology and took issue\nwith the Dean, who then brought the matter to the Rector, adding\nfurther complaints against Duhem. The minor issue having escalated to\nimmense proportions, Duhem requested and received a change of\npositions at the end of academic year 1893. During these formative\nyears, Duhem worked very hard on his science. He published six books:\na two-volume work on hydrodynamics, elasticity, and acoustics, his\nlectures on electricity and magnetism, in three volumes, and an\nintroduction to physical chemistry. Duhem was one of the first to\nappreciate the work of W. J.  Gibbs, writing the earliest critical\nexamination of Gibbs\u2019 \u201cOn the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous\nSubstances\u201d in 1887 and later promoting the French translation\nof Gibbs\u2019 works (Duhem 1907); for an English translation of\nDuhem\u2019s 1887 essay on Gibbs and his Commentaries on the\nPrinciples of Thermodynamics, 1892\u20131894, see Duhem [CPT].\n\nIn October 1893, Duhem left Lille for Rennes. He lasted only one year,\nleaving for Bordeaux in October 1894. He was hoping for a position in\nParis. The prodigious quantity and quality of his publications in many\nfields of science, the philosophy of science, and the history of\nscience were not able to change his situation. Very late in life, he\nwas approached about the newly created chair in the History of Science\nat the Coll\u00e8ge de France, but he refused to be a candidate for\nit. The proud and stubborn Duhem told his daughter: \u201cI am a\ntheoretical physicist. Either I will teach theoretical physics at Paris\nor else I will not go there.\u201d\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s curriculum vitae, written in 1913, on the occasion of his\nnomination as non-resident member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\n(1917, 41\u201370), lists over 350 items, about 50 of which were books. From\nthe mid-1880s to 1900, Duhem\u2019s primary interests were scientific,\nranging from thermodynamics and physics, but publishing on elasticity\nand energetics as late as 1911. In the 1890s, while still at Lille, he\nbegan writing essays on questions of methodology that would lead to the\npublication of his most influential books in the philosophy of science,\ntranslated into English as The Aim and Structure of Physical\nTheory and To Save the Phenomena. It was also in the\nmid-1890s that Duhem published his first essays in the history of\nscience, starting on the path that would lead him in 1904 to a new\nunderstanding of the history of science and to his thesis of continuity\nbetween medieval and early modern science. This path would culminate in\nsuch important historical works as \u00c9tudes sur L\u00e9onard\nde Vinci and Le syst\u00e8me du monde.\n\n\nDuhem made a number of enduring contributions to thermodynamics and\nphysical chemistry. Among these were the Duhem\u2013Margules and\nGibbs\u2013Duhem equations, which deal with reversible processes in\nthermodynamics as quasi-static limiting processes and give a general\nproof of the Gibbs phase rule. These results were obtained in the\ncontext of a program of generalized thermodynamics called\n\u201cenergetics.\u201d Indeed, Duhem\u2019s entire scientific\nprogram was driven by the conviction that a generalized thermodynamics\nshould be foundational for physical theory, thinking that all of\nchemistry and physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism,\nshould be derivable from thermodynamic first principles. Duhem started\nfrom the concept of the thermodynamic potential (the topic of his\nfailed thesis), deploying it in a manner similar to that of potentials\nin mechanics, so as to represent all physical and chemical changes. The\nprogram finds its mature statement in his Trait\u00e9\nd\u2019\u00e9nerg\u00e9tique of 1911; it was well received by\nlate-nineteenth-century energeticists, such as Wilhelm Ostwald and\nGeorg Helm. So important was energetics for Duhem, that his work in the\nhistory and philosophy of science has been viewed as an attempt to\ndefend its aims and methods (see Lowinger 1941). More recently, Niall\nMartin and others have argued for the importance of religious motives\nin Duhem\u2019s work (see Martin 1991, Jaki 1991) and it has become\nclear in the course of Duhem\u2019s writings that he expected the\nendpoint of science to harmonize with the teachings of the Catholic\nChurch.\n\n\nWhatever was Duhem\u2019s initial motivation, his historical and\nphilosophical work took on a life of its own. One cannot read\nDuhem\u2019s numerous historical and philosophical tomes and think\nthat his labor was only in the service of energetics and that the sole\ngoal of his works was but a defense of its methods and its historical\nposition. No doubt energetics might be a thread running through\nDuhem\u2019s various works, and no doubt these works harmonize with\nthe method of energetics as he conceives it, but energetics cannot be\nthe whole story.\n2. Philosophy of Science\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s early methodological views reflected late\nnineteenth-century positivism: Physical theory was no more than an aid\nto memory, summarizing and classifying facts by providing a symbolic\nrepresentation of them; the facts of physical theory are different from\ncommon sense and metaphysics, especially from the mechanical theories\nfashionable at the time. Duhem\u2019s position was immediately\nattacked by a Catholic engineer, Eug\u00e8ne Vicaire, on the grounds\nthat separating physics from metaphysics implied that physics was the\nonly real knowledge (another positivistic thesis), and thus conceded\ntoo much to skepticism. Vicaire raised an important point for\nturn-of-the-century Catholics because the Church was officially\ncommitted to neo-Thomism, with its generally rationalist apologetics\n(see Martin 1991, chap. 2). In his reply Duhem adopted a quasi-Thomist\nposition: metaphysics is a real form of knowledge, more excellent than\nphysics, but separated from it in that it has different objects and is\ngoverned by different methods. This immediate response fitted\nreasonably well into the framework of neo-Thomism, though it did not go\nas far as to reunite the disparate forms of knowledge into a\nhierarchical system of sciences including cosmology and metaphysics.\nDuhem\u2019s mature position was somewhat different, containing three\nkey ideas elaborated upon on various occasions: (1) the\nunderdetermination of theory by fact, often referred to as the Duhem\nThesis, (2) the rejection of metaphysics and models in physics, and (3)\nnatural classification as the endpoint of physical theory.\n2.1 Against \u201cNewtonian Method\u201d: The Duhem Thesis\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s work was important for members of the Vienna Circle,\nincluding Otto Neurath and Philipp Frank, as it had been for Ernst\nMach (for a comparison between Duhem and Mach on thought experiments\nand conventionalism, see Buzzoni 2015). Despite Duhem\u2019s\nconservative beliefs, his work was also taken up by participants in\nthe Viennese political scene, such as Friedrich Adler, who had\ntranslated La th\u00e9orie physique into German in\n1908. The Duhem thesis surfaced fully in Anglo-American philosophy in\nthe 1950s through the work of W. V. O.  Quine. In Quine\u2019s\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism,\u201d the second dogma is\nreductionism, the belief that \u201ceach meaningful statement is\nequivalent to some construct upon terms which refer to immediate\nexperience\u201d (1953, 20). Quine argues that reductionism is an\nill-founded dogma. He asserts that although reductionism has ceased to\nfigure in some empiricists\u2019 thoughts, there remains a more\nsubtle form of reductionism that each statement taken in isolation can\nadmit confirmation or disconfirmation. Against this dogma Quine\nsuggests that \u201cour statements about the external world face the\ntribunal of sense experience not individually, but only as a corporate\nbody\u201d (1953, 41), and, in a footnote of the reprinted article in\nhis collected essays, From a Logical Point of View, says that\nthe doctrine was well argued by Pierre Duhem. Quine proceeds to detail\nan \u201cempiricism without the dogmas\u201d in which knowledge is\nto be likened to a field of force where \u201ca conflict with\nexperience at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of\nthe field\u201d (1953, 42), and \u201cany statement can be held true\ncome what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the\nsystem\u201d (1953, 43). Because of Quine\u2019s reference to Duhem,\nthe thesis formed from the two sub-theses, that (i) since empirical\nstatements are interconnected, they cannot be singly disconfirmed, and\n(ii), if we wish to hold a particular statement true we can always\nadjust another statement, has become known as the Duhem-Quine\nthesis.The antecedent of sub-thesis (i) is often referred to as\n\u201cholism.\u201d Quine attributes only sub-thesis (i) to Duhem;\nDuhem would have recognized sub-thesis (i) as an offspring of his, but\nwould not have fully agreed with it as formulated by Quine.\n\n\nDuhem does not claim that when there is some conflict with\nexperience, we can always make enough adjustments elsewhere in the\nsystem. He makes a weaker claim, also limited in other ways, but which\nwould be equivalent to: when there is some conflict with experience\nwhat is disconfirmed is necessarily ambiguous. Duhem\u2019s\nformulation of his non-falsifiability thesis is that \u201cif the\npredicted phenomenon is not produced, not only is the questioned\nproposition put into doubt, but also the whole theoretical scaffolding\nused by the physicist\u201d (1914, 281; 1954, 185). He does not take\nthe second Quinean step of holding any statement true come what may,\nbut says \u201cthe only thing the experiment teaches us is that, among\nall the propositions used to predict the phenomenon and to verify that\nit has not been produced, there is at least one error; but where the\nerror lies is just what the experiment does not tell us\u201d (1914,\n281; 1954, 185). He refers to two possible ways of proceeding when an\nexperiment contradicts the consequences of a theory: a timid scientist\nmight wish to safeguard certain fundamental hypotheses and attempt to\ncomplicate matters by invoking various cases of error and multiplying\nthe corrections, while a bolder scientist can resolve to change some of\nthe essential suppositions supporting the entire system (1914, 329;\n1954, 216\u201317). The scientist has no guarantee of success: \u201cIf\nthey both succeed in satisfying the requirements of the experiment,\neach is logically permitted to declare himself content with\nthe work he has accomplished\u201d (1914, 330; 1954, 217).\n\n\nMoreover, Duhem does not argue directly for the non-falsifiability\nthesis. He seems to regard it as an obvious corollary of another\nthesis, which could be called the non-separability thesis, that the\nphysicist can never submit an isolated hypothesis to experimental test:\n\u201cTo seek to separate each of the hypotheses of theoretical\nphysics from the other assumptions upon which this science rests, in\norder to subject it in isolation to the control of observation, is to\npursue a chimera\u201d (1914, 303; 1954, 199\u2013200).\n\n\nThe Duhemian thesis usually makes its appearance in the context of\nDuhem\u2019s critique of the inductive method (or what he calls the\nNewtonian method), which rejects any hypothesis about imperceptible\nbodies and hidden movements and admits only general laws known by\ninduction from observation. Duhem accuses this method of being\nunmanageable; he asserts that a science can only follow the Newtonian\nmethod when its means of knowing are those of common sense: \u201cWhen\nscience no longer observes facts directly but substitutes for them\nmeasurements, given by instruments, of magnitudes that mathematical\ntheory alone defines, induction can no longer be practiced in the\nmanner that the Newtonian method requires,\u201d (1917, 153; [EHPS,\n234]). He clearly indicates that some sciences can use the Newtonian\nmethod, derive their principles by induction from observation and\ndisconfirm them as tests warrant. What Duhem thinks is wrong with\ninductivism is that it cannot be used by all sciences. For Duhem the\nnon-falsifiability thesis is a consequence of the non-separability thesis, and\nthe non-separability thesis is an empirical thesis depending upon factors\nthat do not govern all sciences. This is supported as well by\nDuhem\u2019s assertions, in La th\u00e9orie physique, that\nhe is imposing narrow limits on his inquiry, and is restricting his\ngeneralizations to physics; when he first announces the non-separability\nthesis, he announces it as a principle about what physicists do, whose\nconsequences will be developed in the remainder of the\nbook.\n\n\nIt is not generally known that Duhem in his lifetime confronted an\nextension of his thesis in the fashion of Quine and had previously\nrejected it. In the 1913 essay entitled \u201cExamen logique de la\nth\u00e9orie physique,\u201d republished as part II of the overview\nof all his work, Duhem sketched the set of theses constituting the\nDuhem thesis and stated:\n\n\nSeparated from the various schools of Pragmatists on the subject of\nthe value of physical theory, we do not take our stand, in any\ncircumstance, among the number of their followers. The analysis we have\ngiven of experiments in physics shows fact to be completely\ninterpenetrated by theoretical interpretation, to the point where it\nbecomes impossible to express fact in isolation from theory, in such\nexperiments. This analysis has found great favor on the side of many\nPragmatists. They have extended it to the most diverse fields: to\nhistory, to exegesis, to theology. (1917, 156 [EHPS, 237])\n\n\nThus, already by 1913, the scope of Duhem\u2019s thesis had been\nstretched beyond Duhem\u2019s intentions. \u201cThe several authors\nwe have just cited often draw from this analysis of the experimental\nmethod used in physics conclusions which go beyond the boundaries of\nphysics; we shall not follow them that far, but shall stay always\nwithin the limits of physical science\u201d (1914, 218n; 1954, 144n).\nWhile Duhem did not identify these authors, these\n\u201cpragmatists,\u201d as early as 1905, in a footnote of La\nth\u00e9orie physique, he asserts that some of his friends and\nacquaintances and, in particular, Gaston Milhaud, Edouard Le Roy, and\nJoseph Wilbois had adopted his analysis of experimental method, as\ndiscussed in his earlier articles (1914, 217\u2013218n; 1954, 144n). And\nthese same thinkers, together with Duhem\u2019s very good friend,\nMaurice Blondel, were referred to favorably as \u201cFrench\npragmatists\u201d by William James in 1907 in his Lectures on\nPragmatism: \u201cIf my lectures interest any reader in the\ngeneral subject, he will doubtless wish to read farther. I therefore\ngive him a few references. \u2026 Furthermore, see J. Milhaud, Le\nRationnel, 1898, and the fine articles by Le Roy in the Revue\nde Metaphysique, vols. 7, 8, and 9. Also articles by Blondel and\nde Sailly in the Annales de Philosophie Chr\u00e9tienne,\n4eme S\u00e9rie, vols. 2 and 3. Papini announces a book on\nPragmatism, in the French language, to be published very soon\u201d\n(James, 1981, 3; a quick glance at Milhaud\u2019s Le\nRationnel reveals numerous references to Duhem). Thus the Duhem\nthesis in its extended form was favorably received in the Anglophone\nworld during the first few decades of the twentieth century, well\nbefore Quine\u2019s reference to it. Duhem\u2019s reaction to the\nextension of his thesis was as follows:\n\n\nWe do not deny that this extension is legitimate to some extent.\nHowever different the problems may be, it is always the same human\nintellect that exerts itself to resolve them. In the same way, there is\nalways something common in the several procedures reason employs. But\nif it is good to notice the analogies between our diverse scientific\nmethods, it is on condition that we do not forget the differences\nseparating them. And, when we compare the method of physics, so\nstrangely specialized in the application of mathematical theory and by\nthe use of measuring instruments, to other methods, there are surely\nmore differences to describe than analogies to discover. (1917, 156\n[EHPS, 237])\n2.2 Against \u201cCartesian Method\u201d: Metaphysics and Models\n\n\nIn the overview of all his scholarly works in the document\nsupporting his candidacy for membership to the Acad\u00e9mie des\nSciences Duhem contrasted the methodology of energetics with the two\nleading methodologies at the time, what he called the method of the\nCartesians and that of the Newtonians. We have discussed his critique\nof the Newtonians; we now turn to that of the Cartesians. The salient\nfeature of energetics was that \u201cthe principles it embodies and\nfrom which it derives conclusions do not at all aspire to resolve the\nbodies we perceive or the motions we report into imperceptible bodies\nor hidden motions\u201d (1917, 151 [EHPS, 232]). What energetics\noffered was a formal theory, with the character of logical system,\nwhich instead of reducing physical qualities in the manner of\nmechanistic theories, limited itself to marking by means of a numerical\nscale the various intensities of such qualities. Duhem\u2019s critique\nof mechanistic theories (or the method of Cartesians and atomists) was\nthat they are not autonomous:\n\n\nThe physicist who wishes to follow them can no longer use the\nmethods proper to physics exclusively. \u2026 Here he enters the\ndomain of cosmology. He no longer has the right to shut his ears to\nwhat metaphysics wishes to tell him about the real nature of matter;\nhence, as a consequence, through dependence on metaphysical cosmology,\nhis physics suffers from all the uncertainties and vicissitudes of that\ndoctrine. Theories constructed by the method of the Cartesians and\natomists are also condemned to infinite multiplication and to perpetual\nreformulation. They do not appear to be in any state to assure\nconsensus and continual progress to science. (1917, 152 [EHPS,\n233\u201334])\n\n\nFor Duhem, the contemporary scientist who exemplified the method of\nthe \u201cCartesians\u201d was James Clerk Maxwell. Duhem issued\nthree interconnected complaints against Maxwell\u2019s work: (i)\nMaxwell\u2019s theory is overly bold or not systematic enough; (ii) it\nis too dependent on models; and (iii) its concepts are not continuous\nwith those of the past.\n\n\nThe justification Duhem gives for the accusation of extreme boldness is\nthat:\n\n\nWhen a physicist discovers facts unknown until then, when his\nexperiments have allowed him to formulate new laws that the theory had\nnot foreseen, he must first try with the greatest care to represent\nthese laws, to the required degree of approximation, as consequences\nof admitted hypotheses. Only after having acquired the certainty that\nthe magnitudes treated until now by the theory cannot serve as symbols\nfor the observed quantities, that received hypotheses cannot flow from\nthe established laws, is he authorized to enrich physics with a new\nmagnitude, to complicate it with a new hypothesis (1902,\n7).\n\n\nAccording to Duhem, the founders of electrodynamics\u2014Coulomb,\nPoisson, and Ampere\u2014followed these principles, but Maxwell did\nnot. Duhem cites with approbation Ampere\u2019s attempt to represent\nthe attraction or repulsion of currents in wires using Coulomb\u2019s\nformula. He also praises the fact that Ampere abandoned the attempt\nonly after experimental facts about the magneto-optical rotation,\ndiscovered by Faraday, showed clearly that Ampere could not succeed in\nthe attempt. But, again, according to Duhem, Maxwell does not follow\nthese principles. In fact, he goes so far as to accuse Maxwell of\nfollowing the \u201cinverse path\u201d:\n\n\nAt the moment when Maxwell introduced a new magnitude in\nelectrodynamics, the displacement currents, at the moment when he\nmarked, as essential hypotheses, the mathematical form of the laws to\nwhich this magnitude should be submitted, no properly observed\nphenomenon required this extension of the theory of currents; that\ntheory was sufficient for representing, if not all phenomena known\nuntil then, at least all those whose experimental study had achieved a\nsufficient degree of clearness. No logical necessity pressed Maxwell to\nimagine a new electrodynamics. (1902, 8.)\n\n\nAs a result, Maxwell reversed \u201cwith an incredible\nrashness\u201d the natural order according to which physical theory\nevolves\u2014he broke with the past before he needed to.\n\n\nDuhem is well known for his attack on the use of models in physical\nscience. At first, it seems that Duhem tries to link his attack on\nmodel building with his espousal of instrumentalism for the physical\nsciences. He accuses the English scientists of believing that \u201cto\nunderstand physical phenomena is to compose a model\u201d (1914, 103;\n1954, 71\u201372) and of \u201cconfusing model with theory\u201d (1913,\n102; 1954, 71). He specifically blames Maxwell of these\nmisunderstandings, indicating that in his 1855\u201356 essay Maxwell\nproposed only \u201cto illustrate\u201d the theory of dielectrics,\nwhereas in his 1861\u201362 essay he proposed \u201cto represent or to\nexplain\u201d the electrical and magnetic actions by a mechanical\nmodel. Duhem even seems scornful of Maxwell\u2019s interchangeable use\nof the verbs \u201cto represent\u201d and \u201cto explain.\u201d\nHe states, \u201cfor an English physicist, the two words have the same\nmeaning\u201d (1902, 9).\n\n\nFor Duhem there is a crucial difference between representing and\nexplaining. He divides theories into two large categories, explanatory\nand purely representative theories, and argues that physical theories\nshould not be considered as explanatory, but as purely representative\nor classificatory. The argument, as we have seen, is that, in order for\nphysical theory to be explanatory, it would have to be subordinate to\nmetaphysics and not autonomous. The reference to the two words having\nthe same meaning for Maxwell and English scientists is thus a reference\nto what Duhem would consider a confusion about the aim of physical\ntheory, one that arises in the identification of the model with the\ntheory, in thinking that what is represented by the theory and/or model\nis real.\n\n\nBut Duhem broadens the critique of model building to include\nmathematical models along with mechanical models. He decides that, for\nan English scientist, theory is \u201cfor him neither an explanation\nnor a rational classification of physical laws, but a model of these\nlaws, a model not built for the satisfying of reason but for the\npleasure of the imagination\u201d (1914, 117; 1954, 81). The complaint\nis clear: model building has no real place in physical theory (beyond a\nminor heuristic role); it can neither be grounded in realism, in the\nthought that physical theories are explanatory structures, nor in\ninstrumentalism, in the thought that physical theories are\nclassificatory or representative structures. In fact, model building is\nnot even connected to the higher intellectual faculty of reason but to\nthe lower faculty of imagination. So, ultimately, Duhem\u2019s attack\non model building is rooted in something more fundamental than his\ninstrumentalist methodology for the physical sciences.\n\n\nDuhem banishes model building from physical theory (as he previously\nbanished Maxwell\u2019s rashness) because model building breaks with\nhistorical continuity; in fact, model building is not only historically\nnon-continuous, but present models are even often\n\u201cnon-continuous\u201d among themselves. Some model builders even\nfind pleasure in building two or more models of the same law. The fact\nthat the English physicist can accept disparate models, breaking up the\nhistorical continuity of science and even its present unification, is\nwhat shocks Duhem; it is what reconfirms for him that English physics\nis not the work of reason, but the work of imagination.\n\n\nA principle of historical continuity is invoked in the conclusion of\nDuhem\u2019s primary work on Maxwell. Duhem evaluates there an\ninterpretation of Maxwell\u2019s work he attributes to Heaviside,\nHertz, and Cohn, among others. He quotes Hertz as stating that:\n\u201cwhat is essential in Maxwell\u2019s theories is Maxwell\u2019s\nequations.\u201d He takes this to be Hertz\u2019s way of salvaging\nwhat is valuable in Maxwell from the midst of logical errors and\nincoherence, which are not only difficult to correct, but which have\nfrustrated many illustrious mathematicians. But Duhem cannot accept\nHertz\u2019s implied criterion of identity for physical theories. He\nasserts that he might accept such a criterion for algebra but \u201ca\nphysicist is not an algebraist\u201d:\n\n\nAn equation does not simply bear on letters; such letters symbolize\nphysical magnitudes which must be either measurable experimentally or\nformed from other measurable magnitudes. Therefore, if a physicist is\ngiven only an equation, he is not taught anything. To this equation\nmust be joined rules by which the letters that the equation bears upon\nare made to correspond to the physical magnitudes they represent. And\nthat which allows us to know these rules is the set of hypotheses and\narguments by which one has arrived at the equations in question. [The\nset of rules] is the theory that the equations summarize in a symbolic\nform: in physics, an equation, detached from the theory that leads\nto it, has no meaning. (1902, 223.)\n\n\nDuhem proceeds to detail two complete theories that can recover\nMaxwell\u2019s equations within a logical and coherent structure, the\ntheories of Boltzmann and Helmholtz. The only criterion he gives for\nchoosing between these two theories, though without elaborating upon it\nor justifying it, is that Helmholtz\u2019s theory is to be preferred\nover Boltzmann\u2019s theory because it is a natural \u201cextension\nof the doctrines of Poisson, Ampere, Weber, and Newmann; it leads\nlogically from the principles posited at the start of the nineteenth\ncentury to the most seductive consequences of Maxwell\u2019s theories,\nfrom the laws of Coulomb to the electromagnetic theory of light; [it\ndoes so] without losing any of the recent victories of electrical\nscience; it reestablishes the continuity of tradition\u201d (1902,\n225).\n\n\nDuhem does not attempt to justify his criterion of historical\ncontinuity in his study of Maxwell, perhaps because he previously\nbroached the question. In an early methodological article, he asserts:\n\nIF WE RESTRICT OURSELVES TO INVOKING CONSIDERATIONS OF PURE\nLOGIC, we cannot prevent a physicist from representing different\nsets of laws, or even a single group of laws, by several irreconcilable\ntheories. We cannot condemn incoherence in the development of physical\ntheory. (1893, 366 and elsewhere; [EHPS, 66])\nThus historical continuity as a consideration falls outside of pure\nlogic and outside reasons of physics proper, but deals with the\nrelation between physics and metaphysics, what Duhem calls\n\u201cmetaphysical cosmology.\u201d Surprisingly, if one considers\nhim as an instrumentalist, for Duhem, we must judge a physical theory\nin comparison to an ideal and perfect theory that provides the total\nand adequate metaphysical explanation of the nature of material\nthings, that is, the natural classification of laws. (For more on Duhem on natural classification and conventionalism, see Dion 2013, Dion 2017, and Ivanova 2015.) For that reason, a coherent physical theory is more perfect than an incoherent set of\nincompatible theories. Elaborating upon this point and commenting upon\nthe connection between cosmology\u2014that is, metaphysics, natural\nclassification, or the ideal form of physical theory\u2014and\nphysical theory itself, Duhem asserts:\n\n\nIt is not enough for cosmologists to know very accurately the doctrines\nof contemporary theoretical physics; they must also know past\ndoctrines. In fact, current theory need not be analogous with\ncosmology, but with the ideal theory toward which current theory tends\nby a continual progress. Therefore, it is not up to philosophers to\ncompare physics as it is now with their cosmology, by congealing\nscience in some manner at a precise moment of its evolution, but rather\nto appreciate the development of theory and to surmise the goal toward\nwhich it is directed. Now, nothing can guide them safely in\nconjecturing the path that physics will follow if not the knowledge of\nthe road it has already covered. (1914, 460; 1954, 303.)\n\n\nDuhem supports this statement using an analogy with the trajectory\nof a ball. We cannot guess its end point with an instant glance at the\nball, but we can prolong its trajectory if we followed the ball from\nthe moment it was struck. So we cannot guess the end point of physical\ntheory, the natural classification, by looking at any particular\ntheory. We must appeal to the trajectory of physical theory, to its\nhistory, to enable us to tell whether any particular theory is likely\nto contribute toward the ultimate natural classification. Duhem\u2019s\ndoctrine of natural classification provides the grounds for various\ncommentators to argue that Duhem is not an instrumentalist, that his\nphilosophy of science considered as a whole looks more like convergent\nor motivational realism (see Maiocchi in Ariew and Barker 1990 and\nothers).\n2.3 Later Developments\n\n\nAs presented so far, Duhem is a philosopher who weaves together two\nlarge patchworks of theses: (i) instrumentalism or fictionalism,\nanti-atomism or anti-Cartesianism, anti-modelism, and autonomy of\nphysics from metaphysics and (ii) anti-inductivism or critique of\nNewtonian method, the Duhem thesis, that is, non-falsifiability and\nnon-separability. Both sets of theses are intended as empirical theses\nabout the workings of science and both are important to understanding\nDuhem\u2019s thought. The first set of theses effectively demarcates\nphysical theory as an autonomous domain apart from other domains, that\nis, rejects any external method, and the second set then operates on\nthe internal workings of physical theory. Having set apart physical\ntheory, Duhem asserts that no internal method leads inexorably to the\ntruth.\n\n\nFor Duhem, there are always at least two basic ways of proceeding in\nscience. Some scientists prefer the clutter of concrete details and\nthus do not mind ad hoc explanations, complications, and corrected\ntheories; others prefer abstract, simple, and uncomplicated theories,\neven if they are gotten at the price of conceptual novelty. As we have\nseen, Duhem discusses this dichotomy under the rubric of the English\nmind and the French mind\u2014what he also calls \u201cesprit de\nfinesse\u201d and \u201cesprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie,\u201d\nfollowing Blaise Pascal. Despite the labels \u201cEnglish\u201d and\n\u201cFrench,\u201d Duhem\u2019s categories are analytic ones, not\nmere epithets to be used rhetorically against his adversaries. In fact,\nfrom the start, when he described the broad-shallow English mind, his\narchetype was Napoleon Bonaparte, a great genius of military\ndetails\u2014not an Englishman. Duhem\u2019s ideal of the narrow-deep\nFrench mind was Newton, the geometer of physics\u2014not a Frenchman.\nThus, when Duhem accused Faraday and Maxwell of having English minds,\nhe did so by trying to establish something about how they conducted\ntheir science, not by referring to their ancestry.\n\n\nIn his last work, La science allemande, mostly a work of\nwartime propaganda, Duhem added a third kind of mind to his original\ntwo, namely, the German mind. If there are two basic types, the French\nmind and the English mind, then what could the German mind possibly be?\nCiting Pascal, Duhem tells us that truth requires both reason and\nargument\u2014raison and raisonnement. Logic, or our\nability to link propositions with one another, allows us to deduce one\ntruth from another; but that ability, by itself, merely gets us back to\nfirst principles or axioms. We also need a faculty that allows us to\nintuit the truth of the first principles or axioms, that is, bon\nsens (good sense). Bon sens is to \u201cesprit de\nfinesse\u201d what \u201cpure logic\u201d is to \u201cesprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie.\u201d Moreover, bon sens, our\nfaculty of recognizing fundamental truth gets perfected by the practice\nof history, by our becoming more aware of the failures and successes of\nprevious theories, by thinking about the trajectory of scientific\ntheories, rather than by considering a single theory frozen in time.\nThe dual scheme can now be expanded. We need logic, the ability to\nsystematize, but we also need intuition, the recognition of truth. When\none of these is allowed to dominate, we get a science which is all\nintuition, all \u201cesprit de finesse,\u201d but no logical\ncoherence, namely, English science; or we get a science which is all\nlogic, lacking bon sens, namely, German science. German science then is\na degenerate kind of French science, the latter being predominantly\n\u201cesprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie,\u201d corrected by bon\nsens.\n\n\nAs a result, we can talk about a continuum of sciences; at one extreme\non the theoretical side is German science, or logicism, and at the\nother extreme on the experimental side is English science, or crude\nmodelism. In the middle is French science, which allegedly tempers the\nlogical bent with historicism.\n\n\nIn a well-known chapter of Social Theory and Social Structure,\nthe sociologist of science Robert Merton refers to Duhem\u2019s\ncritique of German science as one of the many polemics against national\nkinds affirming a universalistic standard: \u201cDispassionate\nscientists impugned \u2018enemy\u2019 contributions, charging\nnationalistic bias, log-rolling, intellectual dishonesty, incompetence,\nand lack of creative capacity. Yet this very deviation from the norm of\nuniversalism actually presupposed the legitimacy of the norm. For\nnationalistic bias is opprobrious only if judged in terms of the\nstandard of universalism\u2026 Thus by the very process of condemning\ntheir violation, the mores are reaffirmed\u201d (1968, 8).\n\n\nAt first glance Duhem\u2019s polemics against German science might\nseem to arise from a universalistic standard. Duhem does talk at times\nof a perfect form of science, one without personal or national\ncharacter: \u201cQuite often the great masters possess a reason in\nwhich all the faculties are so harmoniously proportioned that their\nvery perfect doctrines are exempt from all individual character, as\nfrom all national character. \u2026 In such works one no longer sees\nthe genius of this or that people, but only the genius of\nHumanity\u201d (1915, 105 [EHPS, 253]). Such perfection for Duhem is an\nequilibrium of disparate elements, not itself a single ideal type.\nDuhem might regret what he sees as an overabundance of esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie in German science, and might wish that it be\ntempered by a bit more finesse, but there is no suggestion in Duhem\nthat there is only one way to proceed in science.\n\n\nDuhem specifically states that the\n\n\nperfect form of science could not be obtained except by a very precise\nseparation of the various methods concurring in the discovery of truth.\nEach of the many faculties that human reason puts into play when it\nwishes to know more and better would have to play its role, without\nanything being omitted, without any faculty being overlooked. This\nperfect equilibrium between the many organs of reason does not occur in\nany one man. In each of us one faculty is stronger and another weaker.\nIn the conquest of truth the weaker will not contribute as much as it\nshould and the stronger will take on more than its share. (1915, 104\n[EHPS, 252]).\n\n\nAt bottom, despite his talk of ideal type and equilibrium,\nDuhem\u2019s science is not universalistic. The strength of his\nanalysis is that there is no single direction within science that each\nindividual must follow. For that, one would need to ground physics in a\nparticular metaphysics\u2014which Duhem explicitly rejects with his\ninstrumentalism\u2014or rather, to be guided by what one projects\nmetaphysics will look like over the long run. Unfortunately, Duhem took\nthis last thought too rigidly and ultimately condemned all innovations\nas breaking with the past, either due to an excess of esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie, as with non-Euclidean geometry and\nrelativity, or an excess of esprit de finesse, as with\nelectron theory. But his philosophy of science itself contained the\nseeds of scientific pluralism, which are the foundations of the Duhem\nthesis, that is, the thought that there are many legitimate and\ndisparate ways of proceeding in science.\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s famous critique of crucial experiments follows a similar\npattern. Duhem argues that crucial experiments resemble false dilemmas:\nhypotheses in physics do not come in pairs, so that crucial experiments\ncannot transform one of the two into a demonstrated truth. For example,\nthe Newtonian emission theory predicts that light travels faster in\nwater than in air; according to the wave theory, light travels slower\nin water than in air. Dominique Fran\u00e7ois Arago proposed a\ncrucial experiment comparing the respective velocities. L\u00e9on\nFoucault then devised an apparatus to measure the speed of light in\nvarious media and found a lower velocity in water than in air. Arago\nand Foucault concluded for the wave theory, thinking that the\nexperiment refuted the emission theory. Discussing Foucault\u2019s\nexperiment, Duhem asks whether we dare assert that no other hypothesis\nis imaginable and suggests that instead of light being either a simple\nparticle or wave, it might be something else, perhaps a disturbance\npropagated within a dielectric medium, as theorized by Maxwell (1914,\n285\u201389; 1954, 188\u201390).\n\nMore than a century after Duhem argued for his non-falsifiability\nthesis, the set of issues connected with it are still elaborated upon,\ncriticized, and defended in the large literature on the philosophy of\nscience. Given holism, non-falsifiability follows logically and thus,\nwhen an experiment goes wrong, there is no set way to determine which\nhypothesis among many hypotheses is defective. Duhem proposed bon\nsens as a resolution to the problem, but that solution seemed\nunsatisfactory to many: it looked more psychological than\nepistemological and it sounded too vague. Thus scholars attempted to\narticulate further what Duhem might have meant as bon sens\n(see Ivanova 2010, Kidd 2011, Ivanova 2011, and Ivanova and Pasternote\n2013). Others proposed their own resolutions to the problem,\nattempting to isolate defective hypotheses by extra-logical means,\nwhether by inference to the best explanation, Bayesian devices,\nerror-statistical methods, or though elaborate experimental practices;\nfor an analysis of such solutions, see Dietrich and Honenberger 2020\nor Ivanova 2021).\n3. History of Science\n\n\nFor most of the nineteenth century, scholars treated \u201cmedieval\nscience\u201d as an oxymoron. Since nothing from the Middle Ages was\nworthy of the name \u201cscience,\u201d no history of medieval\nscience could be written. For example, William Whewell referred to\nGreek philosophy as \u201cthe period of the first waking of\nscience\u201d and to the medieval era as \u201cthat of its mid-day\nslumber\u201d (1857, I, Introduction). As a result, Whewell\u2019s\nchapter on medieval science from the History of the Inductive\nSciences, entitled \u201cOf the Mysticism of the Middle\nAges,\u201d was just two-pages long.\n\n\nWith work such as Whewell\u2019s being typical of Duhem\u2019s\nintellectual context, when Duhem wrote L\u2019\u00e9volution de\nla m\u00e9canique, in 1903, he dismissed the Middle Ages as\nscientifically sterile. Similarly, Duhem\u2019s history of chemical\ncombination, Le mixte et la combinaison chimique, published in\nbook-form in 1902, had jumped from Aristotle\u2019s concept of\nmixtio to modern concepts. It was only in 1904, while writing\nLes origines de la statique that Duhem came across an unusual\nreference to a then-unknown medieval thinker, Jordanus de Nemore. His\npursuit of this reference, and the research to which it led, is widely\nacknowledged to have created the field of the history of medieval\nscience. Where Duhem\u2019s previous histories had been silent,\nLes origines de la statique contained a number of chapters on\nmedieval science: one treated Jordanus de Nemore; another treated his\nfollowers; a third argued their influence on Leonardo de Vinci. In the\nsecond volume, Duhem greatly extended his historical scope. As\nexpected, he covered seventeenth-century statics, but he also returned\nto the middle ages, spending four chapters on geostatics, including the\nwork of Albert of Saxony in the fourteenth century. Les origines de\nla statique is thus a transition from Duhem\u2019s early\nconventional histories to the later work for which he is best known,\nEtudes sur L\u00e9onard de Vinci, and Le Syst\u00e8me\ndu monde, in which his thesis of the continuity of late medieval\nand early modern science is fully displayed.\n\n\nFrom 1906 to 1913, Duhem delved deeply into his favorite guide for the\nrecovery of the past, the scientific notebooks of Leonardo de Vinci. He\npublished a series of essays uncovering de Vinci\u2019s medieval\nsources and their influences on the moderns. The third volume of\nDuhem\u2019s Etudes sur L\u00e9onard de Vinci gained a new\nsubtitle, Les pr\u00e9curseurs parisiens de Galil\u00e9e,\nannouncing Duhem\u2019s bold new thesis that even the works of Galileo\nhad a medieval heritage; reviewing his historical accomplishments,\nDuhem summarized them as follows:\n\n\nWhen we see the science of Galileo triumph over the stubborn\nPeripatetic philosophy of somebody like Cremonini, we believe, since we\nare ill-informed about the history of human thought, that we are\nwitness to the victory of modern, young science over medieval\nphilosophy, so obstinate in its mechanical repetition. In truth, we are\ncontemplating the well-paved triumph of the science born at Paris\nduring the fourteenth century over the doctrines of Aristotle and\nAverroes, restored into repute by the Italian Renaissance. (1917, 162\n[EHPS, 193])\n\n\nDuhem presented Galilean dynamics as a continuous development out of\nmedieval dynamics. He recovered the late medieval theory of impetus,\ntracing it from John Philoponus\u2019 criticism of Aristotle to its\nmature statements in the fourteenth century works of John Buridan and\nNicole Oresme: \u201cThe role that impetus played in Buridan\u2019s\ndynamics is exactly the one that Galileo attributed to impeto\nor momento, Descartes to \u2018quantity of motion,\u2019 and\nLeibniz finally to vis viva. So exact is this\ncorrespondence that, in order to exhibit Galileo\u2019s dynamics,\nTorricelli, in his Lezioni accademiche, often took up\nBuridan\u2019s reasons and almost his exact words\u201d (1917, 163\u201362\n[EHPS, 194]). Duhem then sketched the extension of impetus theory from\nterrestrial dynamics to the motions of the heavens and earth:\n\n\nNicole Oresme attributed to the earth a natural impetus similar to\nthe one Buridan attributed to the celestial orbs. In order to account\nfor the vertical fall of weights, he allowed that one must compose this\nimpetus by which the mobile rotates around the earth with the impetus\nengendered by weight. The principle he distinctly formulated was only\nobscurely indicated by Copernicus and merely repeated by Giordano\nBruno. Galileo used geometry to derive the consequences of that\nprinciple, but without correcting the incorrect form of the law of\ninertia implied in it. (1917, 166 [EHPS, 196])\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s essays on Leonardo de Vinci concluded with a\nspeculation about the means for the transmission of medieval ideas to\nmodern science. Since the studies of Buridan and Oresme had remained in\nlarge part in manuscript, Duhem suggested that Albert of Saxony, whose\nworks were printed and reprinted during the sixteenth century, was the\nlikely link to Galileo. Duhem\u2019s key to understanding the\ntransmission of medieval science was Galileo\u2019s use of the phrase\nDoctores Parisienses, a conventional label denoting Buridan\nand Oresme, among others. Based on evidence including references to\ncertain unusual doctrines and the particular order in which the\nquestions were arranged, Duhem conjectured that Galileo had consulted\nGeorge Lokert\u2019s compilation of Albert of Saxony, Themo Judaeus,\nand others, and the works of the Dominican Domingo de Soto (1906\u201313,\nIII.582\u201383). Duhem\u2019s conjecture has been revised and expanded\nupon: The means of transmission has been made clearer because of the\nlabor of A. C. Crombie, Adriano Carugo, and William Wallace.\n\n\nIn the three years before his death in 1916, Duhem wrote Le\nSyst\u00e8me du monde, but did not succeed in finishing it. He\nintended it as a twelve-volume work on the history of cosmological\ndoctrines, ending with Copernicus. He completed nine volumes, the\nfirst five being published from 1914 to 1919, and the next four having\nto wait until the 1950s; a tenth, incomplete volume was also published\nthen. These tomes impart an enormous amount of information about\nmedieval astronomy, astrology, tidal theory, and geostatics, again\npresenting many sources for the first time in the modern era. They\nalso trace developments in doctrines associated with such concepts as\ninfinity, place, time, void, and the plurality or unity of the world.\nDuhem intended to write a 300-page summary of his results after he was\ndone with the Le Syst\u00e8me du monde; he did not have the\ntime to accomplish what would have surely been an amazing\nvolume. (Duhem [LAS] is an attempt to construct such a single volume\nfrom the ten volumes of the Le Syst\u00e8me du monde.)\n\n\nUnlike his philosophical work, Duhem\u2019s influential contemporaries\ndid not receive his historical work with sympathy. As early as 1916,\nAntonio Favaro, the editor of Le Opere di Galileo Galilei,\nrejected the continuity of medieval and early modern science. The next\ngeneration of historians of science, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 for\nexample, acknowledged Duhem\u2019s studies as the foundation for\nmodern studies of medieval science, but subjected them to harsh\ncriticism. Two themes divide Koyr\u00e9\u2019s historical work from\nthat of Duhem. It presents histories of science in which metaphysics\nplays a primary role in explaining scientific change and it espouses a\nhistoriography that gives a central place to the concept of revolution.\nMedieval thought and early modern science are judged to be different in\nkind as well as in content.\n\n\nAt the beginning of an essay on void and infinite space, Koyr\u00e9\nquotes a passage from Duhem that has become infamous: \u201cIf we were\nobliged to assign a date to the birth of modern science, we would\nundoubtedly choose 1277, when the Bishop of Paris solemnly proclaimed\nthat a multiplicity of worlds could exist, and that the system of\ncelestial spheres could, without contradiction, be endowed with\nstraight line motion\u201d (1906\u201313, II.411; see also 1913\u201359, VII.\n4). Koyr\u00e9 calls the two theses from the condemnations of 1277\n\u201cabsurdities,\u201d noting that they arise in a theological\ncontext, and rejects Duhem\u2019s date for the birth of modern\nscience; he remarks that Duhem gives another date elsewhere,\ncorresponding to Buridan\u2019s impetus theory being extended to the\nheavens, but dismisses it also, saying that \u201cit is as false as\nthe first date\u201d (1961, 37n). For Koyr\u00e9, the introduction\nof Platonic metaphysics, the mathematization of nature, marks a break\nwith the Aristotelian Middle Ages.\n\n\nKoyr\u00e9\u2019s work influenced Thomas Kuhn and others who made\n\u201cscientific revolutions\u201d a central feature of their\nhistorical accounts. Still, the work of Kuhn and later historically\noriented philosophers and sociologists of science did attempt to\nreintegrate the philosophical and historical studies that Duhem pursued\ntogether but that were separated for a good part of the twentieth\ncentury.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<p>\n\nDuhem often first published his main works, such as <em>Les\nth\u00e9ories \u00e9lectriques de J.
