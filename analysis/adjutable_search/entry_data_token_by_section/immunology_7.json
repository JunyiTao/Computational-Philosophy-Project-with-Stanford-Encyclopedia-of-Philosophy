    "main_text": "The Character of Immunological Knowledge\n4. The Character of Immunological Knowledge\n\nCase studies of immunology have contributed to understanding the role\nof models and the structure of theory in the biomedical sciences (see\nthe entry on\n models in science).\n For example, Schaffner provided detailed analysis of the clonal\nselection theory and the two-component theory of the immune response\nto elaborate his criticism of the classical view of scientific\ntheories and to provide an account in which middle range theories,\nconsisting of interrelated theoretical models, organize subject areas\nin biology (Schaffner 1980). A taxonomy of immune models (both\nconceptual and experimental) exhibit a mosaic of methodologies and\ntheoretical ways in which information is obtained and integrated in\nthis field (Baetu 2014). Furthermore, high throughput sequencing\ntechniques and other \u201comics\u201d approaches in immunology,\nlike those of microbial ecology, are increasingly utilizing new\nanalytical tools (cf. Huss 2014). In conjunction with systems biology\napproaches, these tools inspire engineering orientations, in which\nbiological systems achieve robustness and stability through the same\nprinciples with which machines are built, namely using system controls\n(e.g., feedback), redundancy (e.g., gene duplication, alternative\nmetabolic pathways), modular design (to minimize damage to local\nunits), and structural stability (Kitano 2001: 18). Apart from serving\nas an exemplar of systems-based theories and models, immunology has\nalso been employed to develop cognitivist models, elucidate conceptual\nand theoretical change in biology, and elaborate on contentious issues\nabout reductionism and anti-reductionism.\n4.1. Cognitivist models\n\nThe rise of the cognitive paradigm in immunology originated in\nconceiving the immune system as a faculty of perception. Immunologists\nexplicitly describe macrophages \u201cseeing\u201d antigen;\nantibodies \u201crecognizing\u201d epitopes; T cell possessing\n\u201cmemory\u201d; and adaptive immunity comprising a\n\u201clearning\u201d process. Such extensions from human psychology\nhave been widely utilized in evolutionary history (Margulis,\nAsikainen, and Krumbein 2011), wherein basic categories of human\ncognition have been extrapolated to animals (Bekoff, Allen, and\nBurghardt 2002), bacteria (Ben Jacob et al. 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira,\nand Tauber 2005), cancer cells (Ben Jacob, Coffey, and Levine 2012)\nand the immune system (Cohen 1992a, 1992b). The influence of the\ncognitive metaphor (where intention plays an incipient role) appears\nthroughout immune theory with extrapolations to cognitive science more\ngenerally (Varela 1994: 36; Varela et al. 1988; Varela and Coutinho\n1991; Vaz 2011b).\n\nModels of cognition in immune theorizing have been extended from human\ncognitive science and linguistics, where representational and\nanti-representationalist orientations have vied for dominance (Tauber\n2013). The dominant model regards the immune response integrating two\nsteps: First, the immune system perceives molecular targets and then\n\u201cdecides\u201d how to react (Cohen 1992a). Accordingly,\n\u201cperception\u201d is primary and effector functions (activation\nor tolerance) follow along a spectrum of responses. This understanding\nof immune cognition construes immunity as an information-processing\nfaculty, where immune activity becomes a computational process\ninvolving algorithmic transformation of an antigenic input into an\neffector output (Cohen 2007b).\n\nThis cognitivist orientation is of special interest to philosophers,\nin so far as such an examination provokes questions concerning the\nontological status of intentionality, the role of representation, and\nthe character of cognitive processing in general. Indeed,\nimmunology\u2019s cognitive models carry the promise of revitalizing\nsome of the key issues prevalent in cognitive science by placing them\ninto the context of a system whose circulating components interact in\na probabilistic manner (Varela et al. 1988; Tauber 2017:\n129\u2013161; Cohen 2000: 57\u201399). Such a \u201cfluid\nbrain\u201d carries wide-ranging theoretical implications (Fridman\n1991).\n\nShared nervous-immune system organizational characteristics have been\nproposed (Nataf 2016). As in the visual processing areas of the brain,\nwhere distinct features of a visual object (shape, color, motion) are\nperceived separately by distinct neuronal populations (C. Gilbert\n2013), the immune system utilizes dedicated cells and receptors to\nprocess fragmentary signals that discern distinct features of its\nenvironment (Swiatczak, Rescigno, and Cohen 2011). These signals are\nthen integrated by higher-level processing, which, by computing\ninformation from their respective \u201creceptive fields\u201d,\nproduce a unified representation of the antigen. Such a distributed\nimage parallels activities of higher cortical areas. So, analogous to\nthe nervous system, the immune system perceives immune objects by\nassembling discrete signals (immunogens, cytokines, chemokines, etc.)\nobtained as informational elements derived from various cell types,\nwhich, in an ascending integration, generate a multitude of T-cell and\nB-cell responses (Nataf 2016). In this schema, the integrative process\noccurring in lymphoid aggregates is the functional equivalent to the\nbrain that employs an analogous hierarchal structure to process\ninformation. Indeed, the nervous and immune systems are highly\nintegrated, both physiologically and anatomically. They share many of\nthe same messenger molecules, have close developmental histories both\nin phylogeny and ontogeny, and intersect biochemically (Ader\n2006).\n\nThe so-called \u201cpsycho-neuro-endocrine system\u201d has a\nwell-established fourth partner in the immune system showing that its\nactivity cannot be understood in isolation from these other systems.\nThe models employed in one cognitive system are readily shared by the\nother and thus propagate underlying theoretical approaches and\nimplicit directives. Postulating molecular-level and systems-level\nrecognition states carries notions of \u201cintentionality\u201d\n(see the entry on\n intentionality).\n Alternatively, instrumentalist and eliminativist approaches argue\nthat intentional descriptions are either only constructs of a useful\nidiom or that they should be dropped altogether (Dennett 1987;\nChurchland 1989). Intentional assignments reflect an ordering\nmechanism for phenomena otherwise difficult to characterize and thus\nsusceptible to error (Matthen and Levy 1984). Errors must be\nunderstood in terms of reference to what end a system actually\nseemingly intends versus what it achieves in given\ncircumstances. In the immune setting, autoimmunity signifies a\ndysregulated state that, in this context, signifies mis-directed\nintentionality of normal immune function (Matthen and Levy 1984: 361).\nAny attempt to frame this process in non-intentional terms would fail,\nas such descriptions do not invoke goals, expectations, unfulfilled\nintentions and the like. Accordingly, immunology cannot dispense with\nthe intentional idiom and the associated psychological metaphors used\nin its descriptive language, if even only as a heuristic device\n(Rosenberg 1989: 38; Melander 1993: 239; Howes 2000). Strong arguments\nhave been made that metaphors in the life sciences act as\nindispensable instruments of cognition and explanation in addition to\nproviding a useful perspective on a research subject (Reynolds 2018).\nIndeed, despite neo-positivistic efforts to rid science of nonliteral\nmeanings to permit an objective (neutral) description of nature,\nanalogical thinking in science plays a variety of crucial epistemic\nfunctions (Hesse 1966; Fox Keller 2002).\n4.1.1 Representational models\n\nAdvocates of representationalist approaches to immune cognition accept\nthe subject-object dichotomy that portrays the immune system as a\n\u201cknower\u201d, an agent, who can represent the state of its\ninner and other environments (Tauber 2013). This has become a\nwell-entrenched orientation inasmuch as the ontological understanding\nof key concepts in immunology\u2014self, individuality, and\norganism\u2014revolves around the status of agency\nin immune theorizing. As already mentioned, from the very inception of\nthe discipline, immunologists have either assumed an implicit identity\nthat grounds the distinction between self and foreign, or that\nidentity is explicitly described as an agent at the heart of immune\ndefense. Traditionally associated with the capacity of an intentional,\nconscious being to act (see the entry on\n agency),\n agency has been redefined in philosophy of immunology to refer to the\nsource of immune activity.\n\nThe capacity of the immune system to create representative images\n(through ligand-receptor structural homology) and to act on them does\nnot mean that this system hosts a centralized control unit. Rather, as\nadvocates of these information-based accounts suggest, immune agency\nemerges from collective behavior of individual immune cells, each of\nwhich acts as a \u201ccellular computing machine\u201d (Cohen and Efroni 2019). From this point of view, the apparent complex\n\u201cintelligence\u201d of the immune system is a product of multiple cues originating from individual immune cells that function analogously to\njoint decisions made by a school of fish. From this cognitive point\nview, immunity arises from shared collective information.\n4.1.2 Non-representational models\n\nA distinct group of philosophical problems stems from\nanti-representationalist approaches to immune cognition. Advocates of\nthe so-called immune network theory challenge the classical\nsubject-object epistemology as a relationship between the knower and\nthe known that heretofore has dominated immune theory (Varela 1994:\n39). Heralding a shift \u201cfrom an antigen-centered immunology to\nan organism-centered immunology\u201d, this view maintains that\nimmune agency requires neither representation nor unified control\n(Varela 1991). Instead of a hierarchical organizational format, this\nde-centered orientation rests on the architecture of the network\ntheory proposed by Niels Jerne (Jerne 1974). He theorized that if\nantibodies of an individual are diverse enough to bind any\nantigen, they also are capable of recognizing one another. Simply,\ntheir mutual interactions must precede any exogenous antigen encounter. Thus, a binding site of one antibody could serve as an antigen to another antibody, which in turn may become the target to still another antibody to create a self-contained, inter-locking\nlattice-like network (Jerne 1985). He further proposed that excitatory\nand inhibitory forces resulting from antibody interactions establish\nan equilibrium state, which, unless upset by an intruding antigen,\nensures stable immune dynamics. Thus, according to Jerne\u2019s\nhypothesis, the immune system is a self-referential network made up of\nmolecules that represent one another and whose reactions against\ninvasive pathogens were only the incidental result of\nequilibrating mechanisms that restore stable network dynamics.\n\nIn the network schema, cognition is not of something;\nperception is entirely within the system itself; the agent has\nvanished, and with that vacancy, representations are discarded (Vaz\nand Varela 1978: 238; Mingers 1991; Coutinho 2003; Palacios and\nBacigalupo 2003; Vaz 2011a). After all, what requires a\nre-presentation? In Jerne\u2019s system, no hierarchy\nexists, and no cognitive center corresponding to company headquarters.\nInstead, what heretofore was referred to as activation resulting from\na subject-object predicate structured cognitive event (described by\nstimulus-response language) now refers to increased dynamic activity\nthat is due to the disruption of the network\u2019s equilibrium.\nAccordingly, immune \u201cknowledge\u201d shifts from a\nsignifier\u2013signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself. Simply, the\nsubject-object epistemological structure of cognition has been\nradically revamped.\n\nJerne\u2019s provocative hypothesis, although elegant in conception\nand effective in inspiring new avenues of research, did not withstand\ncritical evaluation (Eichmann 2008; Vaz 2011a, 2011b). Despite\nconfirming the presence of idiotypic antibodies (i.e., mutually\ninteracting immunoglobulin molecules), their role and overall\ncontribution to immune functions remained uncertain. Furthermore, the\nidea of autonomy and closure contradicted empirical evidence\n(Hershberg and Efroni 2001; Coutinho 2003). However, notions of\ncognition without agency remained plausible. Pradeu and colleagues\nsimilarly proposed that the state of the immune system is structured\nby inter-connected elements, where activation results from\nperturbations of the stable linkages of the resting state (Pradeu and\nCarosella 2006a, 2006b; Pradeu, Jaeger, and Vivier 2013). The original\n\u201cnetwork\u201d theory focused upon the inter-actions of the\nimmune system\u2019s constituents, (Jerne 1974), while the\n\u201ccontinuity\u201d theory employs an architecture of\nantigenic-immune interactions (Pradeu 2012, 2018; Grossman and Paul\n2015). When the immune system is regarded from this\n\u201cconnected\u201d perspective, tolerance is the result of a\nstable continuity of interactions between an antigen and its\nreceptors. Thus, integrated states are quiescent and disrupted ones,\nwhether \u201cforeign\u201d or endogenous, generate immune\nactivation by breaking stabilized associations.\n\nIn addition to antigen/receptor dynamics, other factors are also\ninvolved in delineating the scope of tolerable changes in the\norganism. These include a self-regulated system of diverse\ninteractions among several immune components comprising a complex system of antigen-presenting cells, effector T and B lymphocytes, regulatory cells and a diverse soup of molecular signals\n(Kim, Levy, and Lee 2009; Kidd et al. 2014). So, the functional\ndifference that determines recognition of the foreign results not only\nfrom an aggregate of quantitative ligand-receptor affinity\ndifferences, but also from the context in which the antigen is seen\nand the degree of interruption in network dynamics induced by such an\nimmunogen (Cohen 2000a; Cohen and Efroni 2019). Accordingly, the\noverall function of the immune system may be defined as maintenance of\nmolecular (antigenic) homeostasis (Poletaev, Stepanyuk, and Gershwin\n2008). On this general view, a systems-wide collective\nresponse\u2014not the discriminatory power of individual lymphocytes\nor their receptors\u2014determines identity and immune\nspecificity.\n4.1.3 Presentational cognition\n\nThe so-called \u201cecological\u201d perspective offers still another\nmodel of cognition, where the immune system does not employ\nrepresentations of the world, but rather \u201csees\u201d the world\ndirectly (Tauber 2017: 151\u2013156, 219\u2013228). In this\n\u2018presentational\u2019 schema, the capacity to extract\ninformation about the environment depends on pre-programmed systems of\nperception, whose organizational structures \u201cresonate\u201d\nwith environmental inputs (Gibson 1966; 1979). Accordingly, the\nenvironment\u2019s informational content results from the stimulation\nof the system that already has the ability to acknowledge inputs of a\nrecognizable character. Simply, information is only that which is\nalready meaningful (Ben-Ze\u2019ev 1993: 70\u201371; Gibson\n1979). This scheme would reconfigure the subject-object epistemology\ndominating current immune theory with an information-processing\nfaculty that dispenses with some knowing entity, who sits in a\n\u201cCartesian theater\u201d to observe the world (Dennett\n1991). Drawing an analogy from collective colony behaviors of insects\n(Gordon 2001; Bonabeau 2001) and bacteria (Ben Jacob, Becker, Shapira,\nand Levine 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira, and Tauber 2005), the immune\nsystem may then be modeled without centralized control or directives\nby simply following its \u201crules\u201d of regulation. Such a\nmodel of \u201cembedded\u201d cognition holds that perception may be\nexplained independently of computational processes or representations\naltogether (L. Shapiro 2011). Simply, presentational cognition\nsubstitutes an agent, who employs representations, for a process in\nwhich the immediacy of perception removes any such intermediary.\nAccordingly, cognition is not of something, for perception is\nentirely within the system itself; the agent has disappeared, and with\nthat vacancy, representations are discarded.\n\nAs with Jerne\u2019s system, in presentational cognition, no\nhierarchy exists, and no cognitive center is posited. The\nstimulus\u2013response model has been discarded and activation\nheretofore understood as resulting from a predicate-structured\ncognitive event now refers to increased dynamic activity that results\nfrom the disruption of the network\u2019s equilibrium. Immune\n\u201cknowledge\u201d accordingly shifts from a\nsignifier\u2013signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself, i.e., a system that \u201cknows\u201d only itself.\nTo the extent immunology would fashion itself along these lines, the\nconception of the self partitioned from the world would be replaced by\nan agent-free information-forming and information-processing faculty\n(Orosz 2001; Forrest and Hofmeyr 2001). Such a distributed information\nprocessing system has two key features: \n\nThere is no central immunological processor (as found in a\ncomputer\u2019s central processing unit). Immune specificity has\ncollective properties, and tolerance, as well as activation\ndistinctions are distributed and cannot be \u201creduced\u201d to\nisolated components (Coutinho 1989; Da\u00ebron 2014). \n The dynamical patterns of interactions among the diverse parts of\nthe immune system function strictly in terms of their own processes in\nthe absence of a mediator or witness, and thereby dispense with the\ntraditional features of agency and accompanying autonomy that have\ntraditionally dominated immune theorizing. \n\n\nThus, paralleling current trends in other philosophical disciplines,\nphilosophy of immunology draws from, and contributes to, parallel\nstudies in the cognitive sciences that address the general problems of\nagency, cognition, and behavior.\n4.2 Reductionism versus holism in immunology\n\nApart from elucidating issues pertaining to identity, individuality\nand agency of an organism in its broader ecological and evolutionary\nhistory, philosophy of immunology also contributes to discussions\nabout the origin, organization, and methods of biological knowledge.\nReflecting on explanatory practices of immunology, the epistemic\nmodality has an important practical dimension that contributes to\ndeveloping methodological strategies and conceptual tools to handle\nthe complexity of the immune system. Genomic, proteomic and\ntranscriptomic studies are producing vast amounts of immune data with\nlittle understanding of the basic organization and regulation that\nmust integrate systems-level and molecular-level approaches (Ohno\n1990; Schatz and Langmead 2013; see the entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nThe shift from a focus on the insularity and autonomy of the organism\nto its integration within a complex consortium of species carries a\ncontrasting holistic orientation to the reductivism characterizing the\nmolecularization of immunology (Ulvestad 2007: 65\u201367). The\ntheoretical implications and practical methodological re-direction\nindicate a re-alignment of research strategies for immunology and,\nmore generally, an important contribution to the larger debates\nconcerning the character and feasibility of non-reductionist research\nprograms in the life sciences (Kitcher 1984; Sarkar 1998; Wimsatt\n2007). Initially focused on the question of the relationship between\nclassical genetics and molecular biology, these debates have turned to\nexplanatory strategies in distinct biological subdisciplines, such as\nneuroscience (Craver 2005), ecology (Dupr\u00e9 1993), systems\nbiology (Wolkenhauer and Green 2013) and developmental biology (Love\n2008; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n Still awaiting broader recognition as an exemplar of explanatory\npractices in life sciences, immunology already serves as a case study\nto approach the problem of reduction and holism in biology and\nmedicine.\n\nDifferent models of epistemic reduction have been considered with\nlittle consensus about the applicability of this type of explanation\n(Sarkar 1998). Dissatisfaction with models of theory reduction led to\nvarious models of explanatory reduction that, unlike\ndeductive-nomological accounts, consider relationships between\nepistemic units other than theories containing laws, while relying on\nan intuitive sense of reduction as an explanation of higher level\nfeatures in terms of their parts (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n A dominant concern about reduction is the so called\n\u201cmany-many\u201d relationships between levels of analysis,\nwhere biological features are context dependent and may vary due to\nheterogeneous lower level features (Hull 1974; Fodor 1974; S. Gilbert\nand Sarkar 2000). One approach maintains that non-reductionist\nexplanations should focus on gross \u201ccytological\u201d features\nof the studied phenomena rather than on lower level molecular\nprocesses (Kitcher 1984). In contrast to this approach, immunologists\nassume that reduction is an attempt to explain complex immune\nphenomena in terms of isolated parts and interactions without\ntaking into consideration the entirety of structural and functional\ncomplexities (Van Regenmortel 2002). Thus, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, holistic immunologists attempt to understand the multilevel\ncomplexity of the immune phenomena they study (Rivas et al. 2017).\nAccordingly, non-reductionist descriptions do not attempt to remain on\na descriptive, biological level of understanding, but rather adapt\npluralistic approaches that integrate distinct dimensions and frames\nof reference, i.e., both molecular and higher orders of analysis. This\nperspective aligns with recent approaches in philosophy of biology\nthat move beyond the division of lower- and higher-level explanatory\nstrategies and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary\nintegration exhibited by current scientific practice (Brigandt 2010;\nLove and Lugar 2013).\n\nBoth reductive and holistic immunological research agendas have vied\nfor dominance (Silverstein 2009: 25\u201342). The immune-chemical\nprogram, championed by Ehrlich and other immunochemists of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century, examined immune reactions in terms of\nchemical and physical forces between immune receptors and their\nligands (Silverstein 2009: 456). These immunochemists were adopting a\n\u201cunifactoralism\u201d strategy that endeavors to explain\ncomplex biological processes in terms of single factors (Powell and\nDupr\u00e9 2008). That program was modified and renewed by the\nelucidation of the genetics of antibody diversification, a series of\ndiscoveries that placed immunology well within the molecular biology\nrevolution (Podolsky and Tauber 1997).\n\nStudies of immunity coupled to developmental biology, ecology, and\nevolutionary biology have balanced the molecularization of immunology\nwith an organism-based orientation. Early advocates of such\napproaches, like Metchnikoff, described immunity in terms of cells and\ncellular interactions, a \u201cbiological\u201d perspective extended\nby Burnet, who eclectically endeavored to include underlying molecular\nprocesses (Crist and Tauber 2000; Baxter 2006: 38). He presented\nimmunity in terms of adaptation, selection, and population-level cell\nbehavior, rather than solely in terms of chemical and physical\nmolecular reactions. As already discussed, this broadened perspective\nintroduced the \u2018self\u2019 into the immune lexicon and brought\nnew figurative language associated with agency and a host of meanings\nborrowed from other human experience. And, complementing these\nholistic explanatory and narrative strategies, he also postulated the\nexistence of molecular signatures of self and considered lymphocyte\nreceptors as independent decision-makers mediating immune reactions\nbased on their physical fit with cognate antigens (Burnet 1969). Thus,\nby representing cases of theoretical integration and explanatory\nheterogeneity, epistemic strategies adopted by Burnet and other\norganism-oriented immunologists fit into the inclusion of of plurality\nand unification increasingly regarded as necessary to capture the\ncomplexity of immune functions (cf. Dupr\u00e9 1993; Mitchell 2003;\nPlutynski 2013).\n\nMore recently, attempts to integrate molecular biology with systems\nanalysis challenge the apparent conflict between reductionist and\nholist strategies (Green et al. 2017; Mazzocchi 2012). After all,\nattempts to explain complex immunological phenomena in terms of\nisolated parts and interactions without taking into consideration the\nentirety of structural and functional complexity that these phenomena\nexhibit have been ineffective. For example, vaccine development\nstudies, when limited to investigation of the structural correlates of\nantigen-antibody interaction without deeper understanding of the\ndynamic features of a host-pathogen encounter, often prove\nunsuccessful (Van Regenmortel 2002). So, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, system-oriented immunologists attempt to understand the\nmultilevel complexity of the immune reactions they study (Rivas et al.\n2017). Dynamical systems theory and a variety of network-based\napproaches are used in systems biology to integrate distinct levels of\nanalysis and elucidate the complexity of the biological phenomena in question\n(Green et al. 2017). Accordingly, a pluralistic approach that attends\nto distinct dimensions and frames of reference, i.e., both molecular\nand higher orders of analysis, has directed recent efforts to\nintegrate the complexity immunity (L\u00f6wy 2008: 172; see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n However, the program of melding the reductionist and holistic methods\nas complementary to each other has been slowed by both technical and\nconceptual hurdles (Fang and Casadevall 2011). How to model the system\nas a system requires the collection of information about the\ntotality of interactions to explain causal mechanisms with multiple\ninputs and stochastic outcomes. No approach has achieved dominance\nand, consequently, the question of how massive data might be\nincorporated into a systems-wide comprehensive model comprises a key\nchallenge of contemporary immunology.\n5. Immunology\u2019s Social Dimensions\n\nAnti-foreign imagery in immunology provides an excellent case study of\nbidirectional links between science and society (Tauber 1994, 2016;\nHowes 1999). The wide acceptance of the self-nonself discrimination\nmodel derived from the paradigmatic host-pathogen struggle that\nexemplified the nineteenth century conceptualization of the body as\nisolated from the environment. As developed by Claude Bernard, this\ninsular construct provided biology a theoretical foundation for\norganismal biology that complemented Malthusian economics, liberal\npolitical philosophy, and Comtian sociology to instantiate the\nautonomous body as a political, social, economic and medical entity\n(Foucault 1963 [1973]; Agamben 1998). Notwithstanding that\n\u201cindependence\u201d is a political term, Bernard\u2019s notion\nof autonomy fails to fairly represent the dialectical relationships of\nthe organism and its environment (Levins and Lewontin 1985), nor the\nevolutionary peculiarities of individuality itself (Buss 1987).\n\nThe depiction of the immune self as disconnecting the organism from\nits surroundings harmonized with a particular Western cultural\nexperience of seeing \u201courselves as entities, separate from the\nrest of the world\u2014as containers with insides and outsides\u201d\n(Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 58; Fleck 1935 [1979: 174\u2013175]).\nHowever, this extrapolation of a particular Western notion of\nsubjectivity may well be regarded a social construct (Mead 1962)\ninasmuch as cross-cultural analysis reveals how the ancient Chinese\nsensed self more like a fluid interface than as an enclosed entity\n(Geaney 2011). And contemporary anthropological studies re-confirm how\nnotions of selfhood vary between cultures (e.g., Roland 1988). From\nthis perspective, social connotations and subjective experiences go\nhand in hand with creating meaningful images of immunity and\nbiological identity. Finding its fertile soil in the fifties, the idea\nof the demarcated organism squarely fit the valorization of\nindividualism that had diffused into Western arts, politics and\nscience during this period (Barbour 1995). An insular understanding of\n\u201cthe self\u201d at the core of these atomistic\ncharacterizations lies at the foundation of immune theory and\npractice, where contemporary psychological and philosophical\nconstructions of identity based on autonomous individuality prevail\n(Tauber 1994).\n\nHowever, culture critics have seized on immunology\u2019s notions of\nautonomy as exemplifying modern notions of identity, where boundaries\nare contested, and the body becomes the localized site of battle\nbetween self and other (Sontag 1990; Haraway 1989; E. Martin 1994).\nThese commentators cite the recognized permeability of living\ncreatures, their symbiotic exchanges, and tolerance of myriad\nassimilated foreign materials to challenge the origin and cultural\nresonance of the atomistic framework. David Napier has characterized\nour \u201cage of immunology\u201d as an individualism marked by a\npreoccupation with the self and by an absence of transforming efforts\nto incorporate the foreign (Napier 2003). Active rejection enunciated\nwith warfare metaphors so prevalent in immunology\u2019s\nlexicon\u2014\u201cattack\u201d, \u201cdefense\u201d,\n\u201cinvaders\u201d\u2014dramatically illustrate this formulation,\nboth in terms of the self/other dichotomy, as well as the privileged\nregard of individuality over community. On this view, the\n\u201cimmune self\u201d appears as a metaphor to model Western\nculture, by invoking \u201cimmunization\u201d as an explanatory\nmodel for understanding the core dynamics of post-industrial societies\n(Esposito 2011; Sloterdijk 2011). The metaphor\u2019s wide\napplication\u2014from religion and metaphysics to housing and\ncities\u2014invokes the dialectics of borders and exchange,\nindividuality and communes, where the balance of intrusion and defense\nis invoked to characterize the \u201cbubble\u201d in which humans\nlive. Note, these interpretations closely resonate with the dynamics\nof immunity regarded ecologically, as discussed above. \n\nThese contrasting applications of social descriptions to immunology\nreveal the ease by which the science may be employed for culture\ncriticism. But the exchange need not end with such contributions.\nHaving been implemented in the discourse of science, the imagery\nborrowed from the culture-at-large becomes transformed and then\nreturns to the social domain, impacting on portrayals of persons and\ntheir relationship with others (E. Martin 1994). On this view, the\nscience-culture exchange broadens the implications of understanding\nthe development of immune theory. For example, the political resonance\nof the self/nonself framework was evident in the context of a debate\non tissue incompatibility, whose depiction as innate and unchangeable\nharmonized with Burnet and Medawar\u2019s elitist sympathies and\nopposition towards social Lamarckism (Lafferty 1995). The vision of\npersonhood that stood behind the self/nonself discrimination concept,\ncan be further traced back to Burnet\u2019s self-confessed\n\u201charmless terror of strangers\u201d and his\nDarwinist vision of human relationships as defined by primordial\nselfishness and incessant drives towards domination and power (Burnet\n1971: 12). Along with ongoing cultural and political transformations, our\nunderstanding of immune identity has also changed in the transition\nfrom a modernist vision of delineated selfhood towards a more complex view\nthat dispenses with the self altogether. Thus, the imagery that is\nused to represent the activity of the immune system has deep roots in\nthe broader culture that reflect dominant values and tensions defining the dialectics of the individual and her society. In sum, while immunology provides metaphors for characterizing human societies, the science in turn, draws from its supporting culture to model its\nbiology. Here we see an explicit demonstration of the\nbi-directionality of social and scientific discourses, and to draw the\nline separating the laboratory from its supporting culture again\nproves problematic (Gieryn 1995).\n6. Conclusion\n\nTwo conceptual shifts that have marked contemporary research in\nimmunology have influenced philosophical comment on various topics in\nbiology. The first is a major revision in how the mechanics of\nimmunity are conceived. Taking account of the context in which the\nimmune reaction is regulated, the earlier conception of immune\nspecificity as arising from some simple mechanical lock and key\nmatching between selected antibodies binding to noxious antigens has\nbeen replaced with collectivist models of molecular interactions. In\naccounting for the frequency and intensity of an immune encounter,\nthis dynamic orientation portrays the immune system as a sensor of\nchange rather than structure. The sensitivity of such a\ncognitive system that must mediate multifarious immune reactions\nrequires a co-ordination of collective molecular ensembles,\nin which diverse elements together determine the extent of the immune\nresponse (Da\u00ebron 2014). Indeed, only through modulated responses\ncan immunity fulfill its diverse functions, some of which require\ntolerance of recognized substances and others full blown activation of\nrejection. Accordingly, immune theory has departed from the classical,\nself/nonself framework that depicts the immune response as a simple\n\u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d binary switch, to multifaceted\nmodels that account for a spectrum of reactivities.\n\nThe second conceptual shift addresses how immunity mediates the\ninteractions of the organism with its environment. That ecological\norientation has inflected immunology from its earlier insular\nconceptions of the organism to a dynamic interactive view that\nhighlights how life experience alters the immune response to external\nchallenges and opportunities. With this broadened perspective, the\nidea of immunity extends beyond defense of an atomistic\nindividual, to include the mediation of the organism\u2019s\necological economy, both defensive and assimilative. This includes the\ninternal environment as well, inasmuch as the microbiome, established\nthrough immune niche formation, has increasingly focused attention on\nthe prevalence of immune tolerance, symbiosis, and the biology\ncharacterized by cooperative relationships of various sorts (Eberl\n2010; Bilate and LaFaille 2012).\n\nIn short, the philosophical challenge of defining immune identity is\nframed by differing orientations, namely, autonomous individuality\nversus collective ensemble (both applicable to the regulation of the\nimmune response and contextual placement in the environment). Which\nversion chosen then leads to strikingly different answers to\nimmunology\u2019s key questions: \n\n What is immunity; \n what are the defining characteristics of individuality as\ndetermined immunologically; \n what are the epistemological standing of immune selfhood and the\nrhetorical uses of agency in its various forms (literal, metaphoric,\nand idiomatic); \n how has the cognitive paradigm framed immune processes as an\ninformation processing system; and \n how might biological causation of the immune system studied as a\nwhole be modeled? \n\n\nEach of these issues directly pertains to philosophical considerations\nabout the character of the organism, the relationships of parts to the\nwhole, principles of biological organization and regulation, the\nconstruction of cognitive schemas, and the ability of models to\ncapture complex organic functions.\n\nIn conclusion, although firmly embedded in philosophy of biology and\nengaging in closely related concerns, the philosophy of immunology has\nbecome an established discipline with distinctive interests and\ncontributions. The immunological matters of interest to philosophers\ndo not always overlap with those that dominate immunology\u2019s\ncontemporary research program. This divergence highlights how\nphilosophy of immunology has emerged as an autonomous field with its\nown subjects of attention and methods of inquiry that complement\nrather than mimic or replicate the pursuits in related areas of\ntheoretical and experimental immunology. Moreover, philosophical\nstudies of immunology have contributed to a wide range of pivotal\ntopics engaged by philosophers of biology\u2014organismal identity;\nindividuality; dynamic causation in complex systems (integrating\ncomplexity theory with big data studies); the characterization of the\ngoals and methods of systems biology; the organization of information;\nthe characterization of the normative and deviant; and personal\nontology (self). Each of these areas of research impact other\nbiological disciplines of interest to philosophers, i.e., development,\necology, genetics, evolution and cognition. And beyond the purview of\nphilosophy of biology, studies of immunology contribute to the more\ngeneral discussions of reductionism/anti-reductionism, theory change\nand conceptual modeling, and social and cultural studies of science\n(i.e., the function of metaphors in science, the role of a scientific\ndiscourse). In sum, a rich two-way traffic between philosophers of\nimmunology and philosophers of science has emerged that allows the\nformer to use tried-and-tested conceptual tools developed by their\ncolleagues, while providing a unique outlook for the latter. Given the\ncentrality of immunology in modern biology and the unique perspective\noffered by this science on crucial philosophical problems, further\nengagement not only seems likely, but an imperative for philosophy of\nscience writ large.
