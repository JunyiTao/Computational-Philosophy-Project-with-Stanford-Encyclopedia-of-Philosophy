    "main_text": "Gorgias\n4. Gorgias\n\nThe Gorgias is one of Plato\u2019s most bitter dialogues in that\nthe exchanges are at times full of anger, of uncompromising\ndisagreement, plenty of misunderstanding, and cutting rhetoric. In\nthese respects it goes beyond even the Protagoras, a dialogue\nthat depicts a hostile confrontation between Socrates and the renowned\nsophist by the same\n name.[25]\n The quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric shows itself as an ugly\nfight in the Gorgias.\n\nWhat is the fight about? Socrates asks Gorgias to define what it is\nthat he does, that is, to define rhetoric. And he asks him to do it in\na way that helps to distinguish rhetorical from philosophical\ndiscourse: the former produces speeches of praise and blame, the\nlatter answers questions through the give and take of discussion\n(dialegesthai, 448d10) in an effort to arrive at a concise\ndefinition, and more broadly, with the intent to understand the\nsubject. The philosopher is happy to be refuted if that leads to\nbetter understanding; wisdom, and not just striving to\n\u201cwin\u201d the argument, is the goal (457e-458a).\n\nGorgias is forced by successive challenges to move from the view that\nrhetoric is concerned with words (speeches) to the view that its\nactivity and effectiveness happen only in and through words (unlike\nthe manual arts) to the view that its object is the greatest of human\nconcerns, namely freedom. Rhetoric is \u201cthe source of freedom for\nhumankind itself and at the same time it is for each person the source\nof rule over others in one\u2019s own city\u201d (452d6\u20138). This\nfreedom is a kind of power produced by the ability to persuade others\nto do one\u2019s bidding; \u201crhetoric is a producer of persuasion. Its\nwhole business comes to that, and that\u2019s the long and short of\nit\u201d (453a2\u20133). But persuasion about what exactly? Gorgias\u2019\nanswer is: about matters concerning justice and injustice (454b7). But\nsurely there are two kinds of persuasion, one that instills beliefs\nmerely, and another that produces knowledge; it is the former only\nwith which rhetoric is concerned. The analogy of this argument to the\ncritique of poetry is already clear; in both cases, Socrates wants to\nargue that the speaker is not a truth speaker, and does not convey\nknowledge to his audience. As already noted, Socrates classifies\npoetry (dithyrambic and tragic poetry are named) as a species of\nrhetoric. Its goal is to gratify and please the spectator, or\ndifferently put, it is just a kind of flattery. Strip away the rhythm\nand meter, and you have plain prose directed at the mob. It\u2019s a kind\nof public speaking, that\u2019s all (502a6\u2013c12).\n\nThe rhetorician is a maker of beliefs in the souls of his auditors\n(455a3\u20134). And without that skill\u2014here Gorgias begins to\nwax at length and eloquently\u2014other arts (such as medicine)\ncannot do their work effectively (456b ff.). Rhetoric is a\ncomprehensive art. But Gorgias offers a crucial qualification that\nturns out to contribute to his downfall: rhetoric should not be used\nagainst any and everybody, any more than skill in boxing should be.\nAlthough the rhetorician teaches others to use the skill justly, it is\nalways possible for the student to misuse it. This is followed by\nanother damaging admission: the rhetorician knows what justice,\ninjustice, and other moral qualities are, and teaches them to the\nstudent if the student is ignorant of them (460a). It would follow\nthat, in Socrates\u2019 language, the true rhetorician is a philosopher;\nand in fact that is a position Socrates takes in the\nPhaedrus. But Gorgias is not a philosopher and does not in\nfact know\u2014cannot give an account of\u2014the moral qualities in\nquestion. So his art is all about appearing, in the eyes of the\nignorant, to know about these topics, and then persuading them as is\nexpedient (cf. 459d-e). But this is not something Gorgias wishes to\nadmit; indeed, he allows himself to agree that since the rhetorician\nknows what justice is, he must be a just man and therefore acts justly\n(460b-c). He is caught in a contradiction: he claimed that a student\nwho had acquired the art of rhetoric could use it unjustly, but now\nclaims that the rhetorician could not commit injustice.\n\nAll this is just too much for Gorgias\u2019 student Polus, whose angry\nintervention marks the second and much more bitter stage of the\ndialogue (461b3). A new point emerges that is consistent with the\nclaim that rhetoricians do not know or convey knowledge, viz. that it\nis not an art or craft (techne) but a mere knack\n(empeiria, or experience). Socrates adds that its object is\nto produce gratification. To develop the point, Socrates produces a\nstriking schema distinguishing between care of the body and care of\nthe soul. Medicine and gymnastics truly care for the body, cookery and\ncosmetics pretend to but do not. Politics is the art that cares for\nthe soul; justice and legislation are its branches, and the imitations\nof each are rhetoric and sophistry. As medicine stands to cookery, so\njustice to rhetoric; as gymnastics to cosmetics, so legislation to\nsophistry. The true forms of caring are arts (technai) aiming\nat the good; the false, knacks aiming at pleasure (464b-465d). Let us\nnote that sophistry and rhetoric are very closely allied here;\nSocrates notes that they are distinct but closely related and\ntherefore often confused by people (465c). What exactly their\ndistinction consists in is not clear, either in Plato\u2019s discussions of\nthe matter, or historically. Socrates\u2019s polemic here is intended to\napply to them both, as both are (alleged) to amount to a knack for\npersuasion of the ignorant by the ignorant with a view to producing\npleasure in the audience and the pleasures of power for the\nspeaker.\n\nSocrates\u2019 ensuing argument with Polus is complicated and long. The nub\nof the matter concerns the relation between power and justice. For\nPolus, the person who has power and wields it successfully is happy.\nFor Socrates, a person is happy only if he or she is (morally) good,\nand an unjust or evil person is wretched\u2014all the more so,\nindeed, if they escape punishment for their misdeeds. Polus finds this\nposition \u201cabsurd\u201d (473a1), and challenges Socrates to take\na poll of all present to confirm the point. In sum: Plato\u2019s suggestion\nis that rhetoric and sophistry are tied to substantive theses about\nthe irrelevance of moral truth to the happy life; about the\nconventionality or relativity of morals; and about the irrelevance of\nthe sort of inquiry into the truth of the matter (as distinguished\nfrom opinions or the results of polls) upon which Socrates keeps\ninsisting. Socrates argues for some of his most famous theses along\nthe way, such as the view that \u201cthe one who does what\u2019s unjust\nis always more miserable than the one who suffers it, and the one who\navoids paying what\u2019s due always more miserable than the one who does\npay it\u201d (479e4\u20136). And if these hold, what use is there in\nrhetoric? For someone who wishes to avoid doing himself and others\nharm, Socrates concludes, rhetoric is altogether useless. Tied into\nlogical knots, Polus succumbs.\n\nAll this is just too much for yet another interlocutor in the\ndialogue, Callicles. The rhetoric of the Gorgias reaches its\nmost bitter stage. Callicles presents himself as a no-holds-barred,\nbare-knuckled, clear-headed advocate of Realpolitik, as we\nwould now call it. Telling it like it is, he draws a famous\ndistinction between nature and convention, and advances a thesis\nfamiliar to readers of Republic books I and II: \u201cBut I\nbelieve that nature itself reveals that it\u2019s a just thing for the\nbetter man and the more capable man to have a greater share than the\nworse man and the less capable man. Nature shows that this is so in\nmany places; both among the other animals and in whole cities and\nraces of men, it shows that this is what justice has been decided to\nbe: that the superior rule the inferior and have a greater share than\nthey\u201d (483c8\u2013d6). This is the \u201claw of nature\u201d\n(483e3; perhaps the first occurrence in Western philosophy of this\nfamous phrase). Conventional talk of justice, fairness, not taking\nmore than is your share, not pursuing your individual best\ninterest\u2014these are simply ways by which the weak seek to enslave\nthe strong. The art of rhetoric is all about empowering those who are\nstrong by nature to master the weak by nature.\n\nCallicles\u2019 famous diatribe includes an indictment of philosophy as a\nchildish occupation that, if pursued past youth, interferes with the\nmanly pursuit of power, fosters contemptible ignorance of how the real\npolitical world works, and renders its possessor effeminate and\ndefenseless. His example is none other than Socrates; philosophy will\n(he says prophetically) render Socrates helpless should he be\nindicted. Helplessness in the face of the stupidity of the hoi\npolloi is disgraceful and pathetic (486a-c). By contrast, what\nwould it mean to have power? Callicles is quite explicit: power is the\nability to fulfill whatever desire you have. Power is freedom, freedom\nis license (492a-c). The capacity to do what one wants is fulfillment\nin the sense of the realization of pleasure. Rhetoric is a means to\nthat end.\n\nThe quarrel between rhetoric and philosophy, thus understood,\nultimately addresses a range of fundamental issues.\n\u201cRhetoric\u201d is taken here to constitute an entire world\nview. Its quarrel with philosophy is comprehensive, and bears on the\nnature of nature; the existence of objective moral norms; the\nconnection (if any) between happiness and virtue; the nature and\nlimits of reason; the value of reason (understood as the rational\npursuit of objective purpose) in a human life; the nature of the soul\nor self; and the question as to whether there is a difference between\ntrue and false pleasure, i.e., whether pleasure is the good. It is\nstriking that while Socrates wants to contrast\n\u201crhetorical\u201d speech-making with his own approach of\nphilosophical dialogue, in practice the differences blur. Socrates too\nstarts to speak at length, sounds rhetorical at times, and ends the\ndiscussion with a myth. Callicles advances a substantive position\n(grounded in a version of the distinction between nature and\nconvention) and defends it. These transgressions of rhetorical genres\nto one side, from Socrates\u2019 standpoint the ultimate philosophical\nquestion at stake concerns how one should live one\u2019s life (500c). Is\nthe life of \u201cpolitics,\u201d understood as the pursuit of power\nand glory, superior to the life of philosophy?\n\nReaders of the dialogue will differ as to whether or not the arguments\nthere offered decide the matter. The nub of the debate is as current\ntoday, both in academic and non-academic contexts, as it was in\nPlato\u2019s\n day.[26]\n Even though poetry is here cast as a species of rhetoric, a good deal\nof work would have to be done to show that the substantive theses to\nwhich poetry is committed, according to the Republic, are the\nsame as the substantive theses to which rhetoric is committed,\naccording to the Gorgias.\n\nIs all of rhetoric bad? Are we to avoid\u2014indeed, can we\navoid\u2014rhetoric altogether? Even in the Gorgias, as we\nhave seen, there is a distinction between rhetoric that instills\nbelief, and rhetoric that instills knowledge, and later in the\ndialogue a form of noble rhetoric is mentioned, though no examples of\nits practitioners can be found (503a-b). The Phaedrus offers\na more detailed explanation of this distinction.\n",
