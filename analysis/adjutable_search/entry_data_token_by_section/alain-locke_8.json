    "main_text": "Relativism || The Principle of Cultural Reciprocity\n4.2 The Principle of Cultural Reciprocity\n\nThe second principle of cultural relativism is:\n\nThe principle of cultural reciprocity, which, by a general recognition\nof the reciprocal character of all contacts between cultures and of\nthe fact that all modern cultures are highly composite ones, would\ninvalidate the lump estimating of cultures in terms of generalized, en\nbloc assumptions of superiority and inferiority, substituting\nscientific, point-by-point comparisons with their correspondingly\nlimited, specific, and objectively verifiable superiorities or\ninferiorities. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nThis aspect of Locke's relativism requires a \u201cbeneficent\nneutrality between divergent positions\u201d (CRIP 70\u201371). It\nbegins by fostering a disposition toward cultural toleration in the\nhope that such toleration will lead to mutual respect, which would in\nturn serve as a foundation upon which to base reciprocal exchanges\nbetween cultures. In the most likely case, these initial exchanges\nwill be centered around specific values that form narrowly defined\ncommunities of agreement. In the end, if cultural relativism is able\nto foster reciprocity between value communities to a sufficient\ndegree, then cultural relativism may well establish a foundation of\nmutual understanding and appreciation to support active cooperation\nbetween value groups. The principle of cultural reciprocity restrains\nthe inferences that we are able to make as a result of the principal\nof cultural equivalence in at least two ways: first, its emphasis on\npoint-by-point comparisons limits the scope of the value cognates that\nare discovered, and second, it issues an injunction against\nidentifying or connecting specific values with specific cultures or\nvalue communities. Relativism is to borrow from an idealized model of\nscientific practice; a point of view that does not prejudge the\nresults of a given observation before it is carried out. Moreover, it\npoints out that the discovery of cognates and correlates is not likely\nto be wholesale, but instead, specific and contextualized.\n",
