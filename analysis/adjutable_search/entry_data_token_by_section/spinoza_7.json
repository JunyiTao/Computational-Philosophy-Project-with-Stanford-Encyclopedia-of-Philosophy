    "main_text": "Theological-Political Treatise\n3. Theological-Political Treatise\n\nThe ostensive aim of the Theological-Political Treatise\n(TTP), widely vilified in its time, is, as its subtitle proclaims, to\nshow that \u201cthe freedom to philosophize can not only be granted\nwithout injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that\nthe peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the\nsuppression of this freedom.\u201d But Spinoza\u2019s ultimate\nintention is reveal the truth about Scripture and religion, and\nthereby to undercut the political power exercised in modern states by\nreligious authorities. He also defends, at least as a political ideal,\nthe tolerant, secular, and democratic polity.\n",
