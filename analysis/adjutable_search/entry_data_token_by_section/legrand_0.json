    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nLe Grand lived in London for many years before retiring to Oxfordshire\ntowards the close of his life in 1695. His philosophy was generally\nwell-received at the University of Cambridge, perhaps owing to the\ninfluence of some leading Neo-Platonists there such as John Smith,\nHenry More, and Ralph Cudworth, who were at least initially\nsympathetic to Descartes\u2019s ideas. John Smith, author of\nSelect Discourses (1660), and the earliest recorded partisan\nof the Cartesian philosophy in England, was the first to introduce the\nstudy of Descartes to Cambridge. Henry More corresponded with\nDescartes, and was sympathetic until about 1665, when he launched the\nmost vigorous attack on Cartesianism in the age, in his\nEnchiridion Metaphysicum (1671). Cudworth, like More although\nwith less venom, objected to Descartes\u2019s mechanistic account of\nthe material world in his The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse (1678). It was Le Grand who debated and defended\nDescartes\u2019s philosophy to these and other English critics.\n\nAccording to Anthony Wood, a contemporary of Le Grand\u2019s and an\nhistorian at Oxford, Le Grand\u2019s Institutio Philosophiae,\nsecundum principia Domini Renati Descartes (1672), was a\n\u201cmust read\u201d at Cambridge. (Wood, 1691, p. 620) Further\nattesting to the attention it attracted, Jean Robert Armogathe has\ndetailed how the 1678 edition of this work came to be placed on the\nIndex in 1709 because of its anti-scholastic arguments. (Armogathe,\n2003) Le Grand also published a Latin edition of Jacques\nRohault\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de physique (1671), at the time\nan enormously popular physics text, using Bonet\u2019s 1674 Latin\ntranslation with added commentary, Jacobi Rohaulti tractatus\nphysicus (1682). In 1697, Samuel Clarke published a new Latin\nedition with annotations, and this along with subsequent annotated\neditions were largely responsible for the work\u2019s continued\npopularity as a textbook in universities in England. (Dobre,\nBabe\u0219, Bujor, and Vida, 2021) According to Benjamin Hoadly, the\neditor of Clarke\u2019s The Works (1738), at the time of\nClarke\u2019s entrance to Cambridge in 1691, Rohault\u2019s\nTrait\u00e9 was the standard modern scientific text, and\nNewton\u2019s Principia (1687), had not yet been accepted:\n\u201cThe philosophy of Des Cartes was then the established\nphilosophy of that university, and the system of nature hardly allowed\nto be explained any otherwise than his principles \u2026 . The Great\nSir Isaac Newton had indeed then published his Principia. But\nthis book was but for the few.\u201d Clarke\u2019s Latin translation\nof the Trait\u00e9 underwent four editions and became the\nnew preferred Cambridge textbook, as the Cartesian physics gave way to\nthat of Newton early in the eighteenth century.\n\nAntoine Le Grand\u2019s most substantial work, An Entire Body of\nPhilosophy According to the Principles Of the Famous Renate des\nCartes (1694), is a Cartesian tract from beginning to end. The\nwork is a translation and compilation by Richard Bloom of three of Le\nGrand\u2019s Latin works, which includes alterations and additions by\nLe Grand himself. It is based on Le Grand\u2019s Institutio\n(1672), Historia naturae (1673), and Dissertatio de\ncarentia sensus et cogitationis in brutis (1675). The first book,\nThe Institution, is divided into ten parts and provides a\ntreatment of the general nature of things according to\nDescartes\u2019s principles; book two, The History of\nNature, illustrates the operation of these first principles in\nnature, by means of a great variety of reported experiments and\nexamples. In this book, Le Grand applied the general Cartesian\nprinciples to the study of particular bodies and their qualities,\nshowing how such principles can explain all natural phenomena. His\nextensive discussion includes bodies as various as the loadstone,\nplants, and insects. And finally, in the third book, A\nDissertation of the Want of Sense and Knowledge in Brute Animals,\nhe argued against the supposed link of life and sense from Plato\nonwards. Following a brief survey of various hypotheses on the nature\nof soul by Aristotle, Gassendi, Fabri, and Descartes, he argues along\nwith Descartes that bodies are soulless and animals are mere machines.\nIn the Preface, Le Grand states, \u201c \u2026 this whole work\ncontains nothing else, but his [Descartes\u2019s] opinions, or what\nmay clearly and distinctly be deduced from them.\u201d (Le Grand,\n1694, Preface, end of section iii, unpaginated)\n\nAt Oxford, Le Grand\u2019s ideas were not well received. Samuel\nParker aligned Hobbes\u2019s mechanism with that of Descartes,\ncharging both with atheism. Parker\u2019s condemnations led to the\nbanning of Descartes\u2019s philosophy at Oxford, quashing its public\nentrance at the university. Le Grand responded to Parker\u2019s\ncharges of atheism in his Apologia de Descartes (1679),\nchallenging Parker\u2019s criticisms by offering various proofs of\nGod\u2019s existence. Another long-time, Oxford critic of Le Grand\nwas the English secular priest and Aristotelian, John Sergeant.\nSergeant, best known for his criticisms of Locke\u2019s philosophy,\nwas also highly critical of the Cartesian philosophy. Le Grand\nresponded to Sergeant\u2019s criticisms of the Cartesian criterion of\ntruth in his Dissertatio de ratione cognoscendi (1679). A\nsecond major controversy occurred between the two authors late in Le\nGrand\u2019s life, this time over the nature of ideas. This dispute\nled Le Grand to write a series of short pieces, published later as\nSeveral Smaller Pieces Against M. J. Sergeant (1698), no\nlonger extant. (Bouillier, 1854, vol. 2, p. 495, fn.1) In response,\nSergeant attacked the Cartesian idea of extension, to which the aging\nLe Grand never publicly responded. Le Grand died at the home of a\nwealthy farmer in Oxfordshire, where he had served as a tutor until\nhis death in 1699.\n",
