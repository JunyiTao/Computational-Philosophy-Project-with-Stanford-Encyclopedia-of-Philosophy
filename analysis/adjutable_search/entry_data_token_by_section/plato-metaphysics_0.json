    "main_text": "The Background to Plato's Metaphysics\n1. The Background to Plato's Metaphysics\n\n\nThree predecessors heavily influenced Plato's thoughts on metaphysics\nand epistemology, Heraclitus (c. 540 B.C.\u2013480\u201370),\nParmenides (c.515 B.C.\u2013449\u201340), and Socrates (470\nB.C.\u2013399). Only fragments remain of the writings of Parmenides\nand Heraclitus, including some contained in the dialogues of\nPlato. Socrates wrote nothing. Plato's depiction of his teacher is our\nprimary source of evidence for his philosophy. Parmenides argued that\nthere is and could be only one thing, Being. One could not\neven think or say what is not. Moreover, since change implies that\nsomething comes to be what it was not\u2014I change\nfrom not being tan to\nbeing tan, nothing can change. Reality is static. The\nappearance of change is just that, a deceptive appearance.\nUnfortunately, what little we have left of Parmenides does not allow us\nto decide whether he argued that there is just one item,\nBeing, in his universe\u2014strict numerical monism\u2014or\nwhether there is just one kind of thing, beings or things that\nare. Parmenides' account of Being seems to have contributed to Plato's\ndoctrine of Forms.\n\n\nHeraclitus is the apostle of change. For Heraclitus, the ordinary\nobjects of the physical world seem to be continually changing. The only\nconstant, the underlying commonality, is the pattern of change itself.\nThat there are entities that do not change is, for Heraclitus, an\nillusion. Heraclitus' notion of \u2018flux\u2019 seems to have\ninfluenced Plato's thinking about ordinary material objects.\n\n\nIn the opinion of most scholars, the seminal influence on all of\nPlato's thinking was Socrates. However, it appears from the writings of\nPlato, as well as those of the historian Xenophon and the comic poet\nAristophanes, that Socrates was almost exclusively interested in\nethics. This is not to say that metaphysical or epistemological issues\nwere of no concern to him. Rather, these sources convey the impression\nthat Socrates was not particularly interested in articulating a\nmetaphysical or epistemological\n theory (see Vlastos 1991a).\n Rather, concerned with\ncaring for the soul so that one might live happily (Apology\n29d-30b), he uses both epistemological and metaphysical theses in\nsearch of answers to his ethical questions. However, it is not easy to\ndistinguish when one is engaged in metaphysical theorizing from when is\nmerely using metaphysical notions. The claim that Socrates was not a\nmetaphysician or epistemologist is particularly hard to evaluate, for\nwe have basically only Plato's dialogues as evidence. Since Plato uses\nSocrates as a mouthpiece in many of his writings, readers are forced to\nask when or whether one is reading the doctrines of Socrates, or Plato,\nor neither. This \u2018Socratic question\u2019 is intimately involved\nwith the question of Plato's development and the chronology of his\ndialogues.\n\n\nIn all likelihood, Plato wrote different dialogues at different\ntimes. We typically divide his writings into three periods. In the\nearly \u2018Socratic\u2019 period, we find Apology,\nCrito, Euthyphro, Charmides, Ion,\nLysis, Laches, Hippias Minor,\nMenexenus, Euthydemus and the Protagoras.\nThe Hippias Major, Gorgias and perhaps the\nMeno belong to the end of this period, maybe with the\nGorgias and more likely the Meno verging into the\nmiddle period. The middle period works include the Cratylus,\nSymposium, Phaedo, Republic and perhaps the\nPhaedrus. In the post-Republic phase we then find the\nParmenides, Theaetetus, Sophist,\nPoliticus, Timaeus, Philebus and\nLaws, along with the\n Critias.[1]\n The Socratic dialogues,\nso-called because Socrates is always the chief interlocutor, are\nthought to present doctrines of Socrates himself. These are dialogues\ndevoted to ethical inquiries into the virtues, e.g., what is courage,\nor what is justice? In contrast, the middle period dialogues are\nthought to present the views of Plato, though nonetheless Socrates\nremains the speaker. Here for the first time we find remarks about the\nimmortality of the soul, about special entities called\n\u2018Forms\u2019 that exist outside of space and time and that are\nboth the objects of knowledge and somehow the cause of whatever\ntranspires in the physical world, and the doctrine of recollection, the\nthesis that the immortal soul, in a disembodied state prior to its\nincarceration in a body, viewed these Forms, knowledge of which is then\nrecalled by incarcerated souls through a laborious process. Socrates,\nin the early Apology, is non-committal about the immortality\nof the soul. Similarly, in the early dialogues we find that Socrates,\nin keeping with the claim that he is neither a metaphysician nor\nepistemologist, has nothing to say about recollection and never\nexplicitly appeals to Forms. It is thus in the middle period works that\none locates Plato's first thoughts about epistemological and\nmetaphysical issues. To those topics we shall turn shortly. But these\nare, in the eyes of many, just first thoughts; for the dialogues in the\nlate period suggest changes to key ethical, epistemological and\nmetaphysical doctrines found in these middle period works. Over the\ncourse of the last fifty years, scholars have debated whether and to\nwhat extent Plato changed his views. The debate has grown so involved\nthat it is perhaps best not to worry whether anyone believes the\nextreme positions that, on the one hand, Plato conceived of every one\nof his major doctrines before he ever wrote, or, on the other hand,\nthat he changed his mind on central theses from one dialogue to the\nnext. Broadly speaking, those who maintain that Plato keeps to his\ncentral theses from one period to the next are\n Unitarians (see, for instance, Shorey 1903).\n Those who\nbelieve that he changes his views from one period to the next are\n Developmentalists (see, for instance, Owen 1986a).\n The most plausible position, and the perhaps\nthe dominant position in the contemporary scholarship, is somewhere in\nthe middle. About some theses, Plato, over the course of his writings,\nexpands his thoughts, recognizes difficulties, and even changes his\nmind. About other theses he stands by his fundamental insights.\n\n\nA prime example of the interpretative problems facing the student of\nPlato is the development of his most distinctive doctrine, the theory\nof Forms. Aristotle, in recounting Plato's intellectual development,\nreports that \u201cSocrates was the first to seek the universal in\nethical matters but that he did not separate it. Plato, marrying\nSocrates' philosophy with that of Heraclitus, separated the universal,\non the grounds that the sensible order, where Socrates had focused, was\nin flux.\u201d Plato, Aristotle tells us, called these separated\nuniversals \u2018Forms\u2019 (Metaphysics 1078b12\u201334).\nUniversal is a technical notion in metaphysics: a universal is that\nwhich is predicable of many. It is meant to capture the intuition that\na variety of things can all have the same feature or property. For\ninstance, a bowling ball, a basketball, and a figure drawn on a\nblackboard can all be round. What many things have in common, or a\nfeature they share, is a universal or, in Plato's terms, a Form. Of\ncourse there seems to be a huge number of properties. Many different\nthings are white. Many different things are animals. Each (shared)\nproperty is a universal\u2014a \u2018one over many instances,\u2019\nwhiteness over the many white things, roundness over the many round\nthings, and so on. Thus, for Plato, Roundness and Whiteness are\nForms. Following the lead of Aristotle, scholars have focused on\nwhat it means for Plato, in contrast to Socrates, to have separated his\nuniversals, the Forms. The starting point, then, for the study of\nPlato's metaphysics, is the Socratic dialogues and Socrates'\ninvestigation into universals of the ethical variety, namely Justice,\nPiety, Courage and others.\n\n\nIn the early dialogues, Socrates seeks these ethical universals\nthrough a distinctive mode of inquiry, the\n \u2018elenchus\u2019 (see Vlastos 1992; Kraut 1983).\n Elenctic inquiry is fundamentally a form of\ncross-examination, where Socrates tries to elicit from others their\nbeliefs about matters of justice or piety, etc. Typically the result is\nthat his interlocutors turn out to have an inconsistent set of beliefs\nabout the virtues. At the heart of the Socratic elenchus is the\n\u2018What is X\u2019 question (where\n\u2018X\u2019 typically names an ethical property). The\nanswers offered to these questions fail usually because they are too\nnarrow or too wide. An answer is too narrow if it fails to include all\ncases. An answer is too wide if, while it includes all cases of, for\ninstance, piety, it also includes other things, cases of justice or\nimpiety. We can infer from these failed definitions a set of conditions\nSocrates places on an adequate answer to his \u2018What is\nX\u2019 questions. He is seeking an answer which picks out a\nSocratic Property, e.g., Piety, that is a universal such that: it is\nfound whenever and wherever there is an instance of Piety; and it\n\u2018causes\u2019 or \u2018makes\u2019 the instance to be such as\nit is. Piety's power to make, e.g., Socrates, pious derives from\nPiety's itself being pious. Piety self-predicates: Piety is pious.\nBecause it is pious, when Piety is present to/in Socrates, Piety causes\nSocrates to be pious. In the Socratic dialogues Plato does not\ndistinguish the (metaphysical) way in which Socrates is pious from the\nway in which Piety is pious\u2014in these dialogues there appears to be\njust one ontological predication relation. One has knowledge of a\nSocratic Property when she can give an account (logos) that\nsays what X is, that is, when she can give the definition of\nthe property under investigation. Treating a definition as a linguistic\nitem, we can say that the definition specifies or picks out the\nessence (ousia) of the property, and a definitional\nstatement predicates the essence of the property whose essence it is.\nIt is unclear from the Socratic dialogues whether any other property is\npredicated of a Socratic Property: arguably Piety is pious and only\npious. In contrast, the things that are pious, e.g., Socrates or saying\na prayer, have many properties. From what we can infer from Plato's\nremarks in these early dialogues, and from Aristotle's remarks, a\nSocratic property is in the sensibles\u2014It is an\nimmanent universal. In this respect, the essence of Piety is\nalso found in Socrates (and thus the linguistic definition of Piety is\nalso linguistically predicable of Socrates). Plato's distinctive\n\u2018separation of the universal\u2019 might then be viewed as his\nrejection of Socrates' assumption that the universal (and/or its\nessence) is in the sensibles, (and accordingly a rejection of Socrates'\nassumption that the definition is predicable, or predicable in the same\nway, of the sensible instances as well as the universal.) If Aristotle\nis right, Plato's problem with sensibles is that they change.\n",
