A\nstronger form of this concern is that allowing immigrants from\ndifferent cultures to acquire citizenship within a country will harm\nor degrade the culture and politics of that country.\n7.10 Feminist Criticisms\n\nSome, like Nancy Fraser (2017), worry that neoliberalism has co-opted\nfeminism by making the feminist ideal into one that serves as a kind\nof false market-based meritocracy, where the aim of feminism is, for\ninstance, that woman who has well-paying career, and at its highest\nideal, female entrepreneurship and becoming CEOs of a company. This\nleft feminism unable to attend to the needs and interests of women who\nneoliberalism has harmed. See entry on\n feminist perspectives on globalization.\n7.11 Remaining Criticisms\n\nNeoliberalism is subject to other objections, but many resemble\nproblems for other liberal democratic theories, such as the conflict\nbetween liberal rights (however understood) and democracy\u2014the\n\u201cprocedure-substance\u201d dispute in the deliberative\ndemocracy literature, as well as how any sufficiently liberal approach\nto associational freedom takes the freedom of marginalized groups\nseriously given the prospect for local oppression. Neoliberals have\ndiverse conceptions of freedom, though typically negative, with all\nthe standard criticisms those views invite. And, then, to the extent\nthat neoliberalism like Hayek and Buchanan adopt a contractarian\nframework for justifying institutions, their defenses will inherit all\nthe difficulties with contractarianism.\n8. Summary\n\nThis entry is not meant to determine the one true meaning of\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d, but rather to illuminate neoliberalism as\na coherent philosophical doctrine embraced by figures commonly called\nneoliberals. The entry also prioritizes more even-handed and less\npejorative uses of the term in recent historical research. This is not\nto discount more historical and dynamic understandings of\nneoliberalism. They contain insight. But the goal of this entry has\nbeen to characterize neoliberalism as a philosophical position. If we\ndo so, we can understand neoliberalism as a politico-economic doctrine\nthat embraces robust liberal capitalism, constitutional democracy, and\na modest welfare\n state.[11]",
