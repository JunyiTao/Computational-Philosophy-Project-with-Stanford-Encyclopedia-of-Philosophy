    "main_text": "Explanation: From Formal Analyses to Material Structures || Constitutive Relevance\n3.2 Constitutive Relevance\nWith increased attention to constitutive explanation, mechanists\nrealized the need for an account of constitutive relevance, a\nprincipal for sorting relevant from irrelevant factors in a mechanism\n(Craver 2007; Ylikoski 2013). A system (S) exhibiting\nphenomenon (\u03c8) is composed of many different entities\n(x), with various properties, engaging in myriad activities\n(\u03c6) organized together (see Figure 1 above in\nSection 2). One central research problem is to say which of these\nentities, activities, and organizational features contribute to the\nphenomenon and which do not. In a sense, this is a challenge of\ndefining the boundaries of a mechanism: of saying what is and is not\nin the mechanism.\nThree proposals have been considered. The first, the mutual\nmanipulability account, understands constitutive relevance in\nterms of the experimental manipulations used to test interlevel\nrelations. According to this account, if it can be shown (i) that the\nputative components are contained within S, (ii) that some\nideal interventions on the putative component\n(x\u2019s \u03c6-ing) change the phenomenon\n(S\u2019s \u03c8-ing), and (iii) that some ideal interventions\non S\u2019s \u03c8-ing change x\u2019s \u03c6-ing, that is\nsufficient to establish that x is a component in the\nmechanism. The notion of an ideal intervention in this account is\nexplicitly indebted to and a proposed extension of Woodward\u2019s theory\nof causal relevance to the constitutive domain (see Craver 2007; see\nalso Kaplan 2012). A concern with the mutual manipulability account,\nthough, is that it is best an epistemic guide to constitutive\nrelevance, not an account of what constitutive relevance is (Couch\n2011). The account offers, at best, a sufficient condition of\nrelevance. Also, the notion of an \u201cideal\u201d intervention,\nborrowed from Woodward\u2019s account of causal relevance, cannot be\napplied straightforwardly to constitutive\nexplanations. An ideal intervention on a system cannot\nintervene on both the independent and the dependent variable at the\nsame time. However, when one intervenes to make S \u03c8 (or\nprevent S from \u03c8-ing), one invariably also intervenes on\nthe components of S\u2019s \u03c8-ing. And when one intervenes on\nthe components of S\u2019s \u03c8-ing, one often intervenes\non S\u2019s \u03c8-ing. Because x\u2019s \u03c6-ing\nand S\u2019s \u03c8-ing are related as part to whole, they are not\nindependent, and so require another way to think about ideal\ninterventions (see Baumgartner 2010; 2013; Leuridan 2011; yet see\nMenzies 2012; Woodward 2014.\nA second proposal offers a regularity account of constitutive\nrelevance modeled on Mackie\u2019s notion of understanding a cause as an\nINUS condition: an Insufficient but Non-redundant part of an\nUnnecessary but Sufficient condition for the effect in question\n(Mackie 1974; see also Cummins 1983). On this account, a\nconstitutively relevant component is an insufficient but non-redundant\npart of an unnecessary but sufficient mechanism for a given phenomenon\n(Couch 2011; see also Harbecke 2010, 2014). Allow that any number of\nmechanisms might suffice to bring about S\u2019s \u03c8-ing; each\npossible sufficient mechanism is then unnecessary\nfor \u03c8-ing. Each of these mechanisms is made of components, none\nof which is alone sufficient to produce the behavior of the mechanism\nas a whole, but each of which is necessary in the context of the\nmechanism for S to \u03c8.  This account presupposes the idea\nof being necessary in context, and one might reasonably worry about\nsorting accidentally correlated Xs from Xs that in fact\nmake a difference to S\u2019s \u03c8-ing.\nA third approach to constitutive relevance dispenses with the\ninterlevel framing enforced by the mutual manipulability account and\nattempts to analyze relevance using causal notions only. According to\naccounts of this sort, constitutive relevance is a kind of causal\nbetween-ness. If S\u2019s \u03c8-ing is understood as an\ninput-output relationship of some sort, then mechanistic relevance\ncould be understood as being a necessary link in the causal chain\nbetween the input and the output (see Harinen forthcoming; Menzies\n2012). The putatively interlevel experiments in the mutual\nmanipulability account can then be recast as different kinds of\nunilevel causal experiments. Romero (forthcoming) provides a helpful framing of these issues and offers the novel suggestion that putatively high-level interventions are in fact fat-handed interventions relative to their lower-level counterparts.\n",
