    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Ockham\u2019s Razor\n4.1 Ockham\u2019s Razor\n\nStill, Ockham\u2019s \u201cnominalism,\u201d in both the first and\nthe second of the above senses, is often viewed as derived from a\ncommon source: an underlying concern for ontological parsimony. This\nis summed up in the famous slogan known as \u201cOckham\u2019s\nRazor,\u201d often expressed as \u201cDon\u2019t multiply entities\nbeyond\n necessity.\u201d[31]\n Although the sentiment is certainly Ockham\u2019s, that particular\nformulation is nowhere to be found in his texts. Moreover, as usually\nstated, it is a sentiment that virtually all philosophers,\nmedieval or otherwise, would accept; no one wants a needlessly bloated\nontology. The question, of course, is which entities are needed and\nwhich are not.\n\nOckham\u2019s Razor, in the senses in which it can be found in Ockham\nhimself, never allows us to deny putative entities; at best\nit allows us to refrain from positing them in the absence of known\ncompelling reasons for doing so. In part, this is because human beings\ncan never be sure they know what is and what is not \u201cbeyond\nnecessity\u201d; the necessities are not always clear to us. But even\nif we did know them, Ockham would still not allow that his Razor\nallows us to deny entities that are unnecessary. For Ockham,\nthe only truly necessary entity is God; everything else, the whole of\ncreation, is radically contingent through and through. In short,\nOckham does not accept the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\n\nNevertheless, we do sometimes have sufficient methodological grounds\nfor positively affirming the existence of certain things. Ockham\nacknowledges three sources for such grounds (three sources of positive\nknowledge). As he says in Sent. I, dist. 30, q. 1: \u201cFor\nnothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is\nself-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by\nexperience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.\u201d\n",
