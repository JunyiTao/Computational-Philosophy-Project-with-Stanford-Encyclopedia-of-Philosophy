    "main_text": "The Problem of the External World\n1. The Problem of the External World\n\nThe question of how our perceptual beliefs are justified or\nknown can be approached by first considering the question of\nwhether they are justified or known. A prominent skeptical\nargument is designed to show that our perceptual beliefs are not\njustified. Versions of this argument (or cluster of arguments) appear\nin Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Meditations,\nAugustine\u2019s Against the Academicians, and several of\nthe ancient and modern skeptics (e.g., Sextus Empiricus, Michel de\nMontaigne). The argument introduces some type of skeptical scenario,\nin which things perceptually appear to us just as things normally do,\nbut in which the beliefs that we would naturally form are radically\nfalse. To take some standard examples: differences in the sense organs\nand/or situation of the perceiver might make them experience as cold\nthings that we would experience as hot, or experience as bitter things\nthat we would experience as sweet; a person might mistake a vivid\ndream for waking life; or a brain in a vat might have its sensory\ncortices stimulated in such a way that it has the very same perceptual\nexperiences that I am currently having, etc.\n\nAll this suggests a \u201cveil of perception\u201d between us and\nexternal objects: we do not have direct unvarnished access to the\nworld, but instead have an access that is mediated by sensory\nappearances, the character of which might well depend on all kinds of\nfactors (e.g., condition of sense organs, direct brain stimulation,\netc.) besides those features of the external world that our perceptual\njudgments aim to capture. Paraphrasing David Hume (1739: I.2.vi,\nI.4.ii; 1748: sec 12.1; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell\n1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception\nexcept perceptual appearances.\n\nBut if our only access to the external world is mediated by\npotentially misleading perceptual appearances, we ought to have some\nassurance that the appearances we are relying on are not of\nthe misleading variety. And here is where all the trouble arises, for\nit seems that there is no way we could have any evidence for the\nreliability of perception (i.e., perceptual appearances) without\nrelying on other perceptions. We have empirical reason, for example,\nto think that science is not yet capable of stimulating brains in a\nvery precise way, but appealing to this to rebut the possibility of\nbrain-in-a-vat scenarios seems blatantly question begging. At the\nheart of the problem of the external world is a skeptical argument\nreferred to here as \u201cPEW,\u201d one possible reconstruction of\nwhich follows. The premises are named, as we will want to discuss them\nindividually.\n\nNothing is ever directly present to the mind in\nperception except perceptual appearances. (Indirectness\nPrinciple) Thus:\nWithout a good reason for thinking perceptual\nappearances are veridical, we are not justified in our perceptual\nbeliefs. (Metaevidential Principle)\nWe have no good reason for thinking perceptual\nappearances are veridical. (No-Good-Reason\nClaim)\nTherefore, we are not justified in our perceptual\nbeliefs.\n\n\nA few comments on the logic of the argument are in order.\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n make up the meat of the argument; together they entail\n (4).\n This means that\n (1),\n which is motivated by the skeptical scenarios mentioned above and the\nassociated veil of perception view, would be unnecessary for deriving\nthe skeptical conclusion, as are those skeptical scenarios, were it\nnot for the fact that\n (1)\n is commonly taken to render perception inferential in such a\nway as to lend support to\n (2).\n If\n (1)\n is true, then, plausibly,\n (2)\n is: if our access is mediated by potentially nonveridical\nappearances, then we should only trust the appearances we have reason\nto think veridical. And no other reason to endorse\n (2)\n is immediately apparent (although an additional motivation for\n (2)\n will be discussed below, in\n section 3.1.1).\n (1) is therefore an important component of the traditional\nproblem. The plausibility of\n (3)\n derives from the idea that our only means of verifying the\nveridicality of appearances would itself depend on perception, in the\nquestion-begging manner sketched above.\n\nNotice that PEW addresses justification rather than knowledge. On the\nreasonable assumption that knowledge requires justification,\n (4)\n implies that our perceptual beliefs do not count as knowledge. One\nwho denies this assumption could easily rewrite PEW in terms of\nknowledge rather than justification with little or no reduction in\nplausibility. PEW has been reconstructed here in a way that is\nsupposed to be intuitively compelling. Were we to get specific about\nthe implicit quantification involved (we have no good reason for\nthinking that any perceptual appearances are veridical? that\nperceptual appearances are in general veridical? that\nthis perceptual appearance is veridical?), the argument would\nget a lot more complicated. The simpler version presented above is\nsufficient for our current purposes.\n\nThe problem of the external world should be distinguished from what is\ntypically called the problem of perception (see the entry on the\n problem of perception),\n even though they are motivated by similar considerations, in\nparticular, by the Indirectness Principle. The problem of perception\nis the problem of how perception is possible\u2014how it is\npossible, for example, to see mind-independent objects,\nrather than inferring them from awareness of sense-experiences, in\nlight of the claim that only appearances are ever directly present to\nthe mind. The problem of the external world is a distinctively\nepistemological problem, and it focuses on the normative status of\nperceptual judgments about external objects; it matters little for\nthese purposes whether and how such judgments might amount to\nseeing. What matters is whether such judgments are or could\nbe justified.\n\nPEW illustrates the central problem of the epistemology of perception:\nif many or any of our perceptual beliefs are justified, PEW must have\ngone wrong somewhere. But where? Several subsidiary problems in the\nepistemology of perception arise in the efforts to solve this central\nproblem.\n",
