    "main_text": "Life and Political Activity || Vienna and Rome (1923\u20131926)\n1.4 Vienna and Rome (1923\u20131926)\n\nGramsci relocated to Vienna in late 1923 to open the\nPCd\u2019I\u2019s Foreign Bureau and maintain closer links with\nevents in Italy. There he began to articulate a conception of party\ntactics that contrasted with Bordiga\u2019s sectarian\ninclinations\u2014under which, Gramsci claimed, \u201cWe detach\nourselves from the masses\u201d (GTW: 159)\u2014and began organizing\na new leading group with his comrades from Turin. Gramsci sought a\nUnited Front policy with other radical organizations and parties in\nItaly to maintain a presence across the country\u2014particularly in\nthe South\u2014rather than simply await a crisis to hand leadership\nto the party. This view brought him closer to the policy of the\nComintern. In Vienna he initiated the publication of a new daily party\npaper, L\u2019Unit\u00e0 (\u201cUnity\u201d), aimed at\nan inclusive audience of \u201cworkers and peasants\u201d.\n\nGramsci was elected in April 1924 (in his absence) to the Italian\nParliament, which granted him immunity from prosecution. He returned\nto Italy in May and took part in the PCd\u2019I\u2019s clandestine\nconference at Como. There he made clear his tactical differences with\nBordiga, although the majority remained aligned to Bordiga\u2019s\nposition. In the summer Gramsci took over the role of party General\nSecretary (GTW: 321). The political situation in Italy continued to\nintensify following the abduction and murder by fascist thugs of the\nsocialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti and the subsequent withdrawal in\nprotest of opposition parties from Parliament. Initially, public\nrevulsion at the murder threatened to destabilize the regime but the\nopposition gradually crumbled, and police harassment of anti-fascists\ncontinued.\n\nIn January 1926 the PCd\u2019I held its third congress in Lyons,\nFrance. Gramsci\u2019s conception of party tactics finally won\nsubstantial support from the membership. The so-called \u201cLyons\nTheses\u201d, co-written by Gramsci and Togliatti, underscored the\nurgency of adapting strategy to national conditions in Italy. With its\npartial capitalist development, extensive agrarian sector, and the\nprecarious \u201ccompromise\u201d between the northern bourgeoisie\nand southern big landowners, the unified state lacked a substantial\npopular base (see SPWII: 340\u201375). Fascism, they argued, merely\npreserved the rule of these two classes by armed force and with petty\nbourgeois support. The PCd\u2019I, they continued, therefore needed\nto build mass support among both workers and peasants so\nthat, when a revolutionary situation eventually returned, it could\nexercise effective leadership. In the meantime, Gramsci underscored\nthe necessity of a united front with other democratic parties (SPWII:\n406\u20137).\n\nConcerned at the growing divisions within the Soviet leadership\nbetween Stalin and Trotsky, Gramsci wrote a letter in October 1926\nunderlining the danger this split posed to Russia\u2019s leading role\nin the communist movement (GTW: 369\u201376). However, Togliatti, who\nwas entrusted to pass on the letter to the Russian Central Committee,\ndid not deliver it for fear of causing greater friction.\n\nGramsci himself was now increasingly in danger in Italy where, despite\nformal immunity, the regime increased its harassment of opposition\nparties as it transitioned into a full authoritarian dictatorship. On\n8 November 1926, Gramsci was arrested by the authorities and placed in\nprison.\n",
