Self-Consciousness in Thought\n\nOne natural way to think of self-consciousness is in terms of a\nsubject\u2019s capacity to entertain conscious thought about herself.\nSelf-conscious thoughts are thoughts about oneself. But it is commonly\npointed out that thinking about what merely happens to be oneself is\ninsufficient for self-consciousness, rather one must think of oneself\nas oneself. If one is capable of self-conscious thought, that\nis, one must be able to think in such a way that it is manifest to one\nthat it is oneself about whom one is thinking.\n\nIt is widely recognised that the paradigmatic linguistic expression of\nself-consciousness in English is the first-person pronoun\n\u201cI\u201d; a term with which one might be said to refer to\noneself as oneself (Sainsbury 2011). Plausibly, every\nutterance of a sentence containing \u201cI\u201d is expressive of a\nself-conscious \u201cI-thought\u201d, that is a thought containing\nthe first-person concept. Thus, discussions of self-consciousness are\noften closely associated with accounts of the semantics of the\nindexical term \u201cI\u201d and the nature of its counterpart\nfirst-person concept (e.g., Anscombe 1975; Perry 1979; Nozick 1981:\nch. 1, \u00a72; Evans 1982: ch. 7; Mellor 1989; O\u2019Brien 1995a;\nCasta\u00f1eda 1999; de Gaynesford 2006; Recanati 2007; R\u00f6dl\n2007: ch. 1; Berm\u00fadez 2016).\n\nAs Casta\u00f1eda (1966; cf. Anscombe 1975) points out, there is an\nambiguity in certain ascriptions of belief containing \u201che\u201d\nor \u201cshe\u201d. I may say \u201cJane believes that she is\nF\u201d without implying that Jane realises that it is\nherself that she believes to be F. That is, there is a\nreading of \u201cJane believes that she is F\u201d that does\nnot imply self-consciousness on Jane\u2019s part. But, in some cases,\nwe do intend to attribute self-consciousness with that same form of\nwords. To resolve this ambiguity, Casta\u00f1eda introduces\n\u201cshe*\u201d for self-conscious attributions. I will use the\nmore natural indirect reflexive \u201cshe herself\u201d.\nThus, \u201cJane believes that she is F\u201d does not imply\nthat Jane self-consciously believes that she is F, whilst\n\u201cJane believes that she herself is F\u201d does. Before\nthe dreadful revelation, Oedipus believed that he was prophesied to\nkill his father, but did not believe that he himself was so\nprophesied.\n",
