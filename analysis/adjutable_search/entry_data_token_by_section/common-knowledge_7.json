The skeptical argument put forth by Lederman (2018b),\nindeed, rests on and generalizes related arguments about the\nattainability of common knowledge that were made in theoretical\ncomputer science in relation to the coordinated attack\nproblem (see Lederman 2018a, Halpern and Moses, 1990 and Fagin et al.\n1995, esp. chapters 6 and 11). In the context of distributed systems,\nusing the formal systems of epistemic logic that, as mentioned above,\nare equivalent to the semantic approach privileged by economists, it\ncan be proven formally that (i) common knowledge is necessary for\ncoordination and that (ii) the attainability of common knowledge\ndepends on assumptions made about the system. In particular,\nasynchronous systems do not allow for common knowledge of a\ncommunicated message to arise, making coordination impossible. Might\nthe agents achieve something \u201cclose\u201d to common knowledge?\nThere are various weakenings of the notion of common knowledge that\ncan be of use: \\(\\varepsilon\\)-common knowledge (agents will achieve\ncommon knowledge within time \\(\\varepsilon\\), hence they will\ncoordinate within time \\(\\varepsilon)\\), eventual common knowledge\n(agents will achieve common knowledge and therefore coordinate\neventually), probabilistic common knowledge (agents will achieve\nprobability \\(p\\) common belief, and hence with probability \\(p\\)\nsuccessfully coordinate), etc. Such weakenings of the notion of common\nknowledge might prove useful depending on the intended\napplication.\n\nAnother weakening of common knowledge to consider is of course\n\\(m\\)th level mutual knowledge. For a high value of \\(m,\n\\mathbf{K}^m_N(A)\\) might seem a good approximation of\n\\(\\mathbf{K}^{*}_N(A)\\). However, point (i) above maintains that no\narbitrary high value of \\(m\\) will help for instance with the\npractical task of achieving coordination, so that the full force of\ncommon knowledge is needed. We illustrate the point through the\nfollowing example, due to Rubinstein (1989, 1992), showing that simply\ntruncating the common knowledge hierarchy at any finite level can lead\nagents to behave as if they had no mutual knowledge at\n all.[32]\n5.1 The E-mail Coordination Example\n\nLizzi and Joanna are faced with the coordination problem summarized in\nthe following figure:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoanna \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(A\\)\n\\(B\\)  \n\n\nLizzi\n\\(A\\)\n(2,2)\n(0,\u22124) \n\n\\(B\\)\n(\u22124,0)\n(0,0)  \n\n\nFigure 5.1a \\(\\quad\\omega_1,\n\\mu(\\omega_1)=0.51\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoanna \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(A\\)\n\\(B\\)  \n\n\nLizzi\n\\(A\\)\n(2,2)\n(0,\u22124) \n\n\\(B\\)\n(\u22124,0)\n(0,0)  \n\n\nFigure 5.1b \\(\\quad\\omega_2,\n\\mu(\\omega_2)=0.49\\)\n\n\nIn Figure 5.1, the payoffs are dependent upon a pair of possible\nworlds. World \\(\\omega_1\\) occurs with probability \\(\\mu(\\omega_1) =\n.51,\\) while \\(\\omega_2\\) occurs with probability \\(\\mu(\\omega_2) =\n.49.\\) Hence, they coordinate with complete success by both choosing\n\\(A(B)\\) only if the state of the world is \\(\\omega_1(\\omega_2)\\).\n\nSuppose that Lizzi can observe the state of the world, but Joanna\ncannot. We can interpret this game as follows: Joanna and Lizzi would\nlike to have a dinner together prepared by Aldo, their favorite chef.\nAldo alternates between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the two branches of Sorriso,\ntheir favorite restaurant. State \\(\\omega_i\\) is Aldo\u2019s location\nthat day. At state \\(\\omega_1 (\\omega_2)\\), Aldo is at \\(A (B)\\).\nLizzi, who is on Sorriso\u2019s special mailing list, receives notice\nof \\(\\omega_i\\). Lizzi\u2019s and Joanna\u2019s best outcome occurs\nwhen they meet where Aldo is working, so they can have their planned\ndinner. If they meet but miss Aldo, they are disappointed and do not\nhave dinner after all. If either goes to \\(A\\) and finds herself\nalone, then she is again disappointed and does not have dinner. But\nwhat each really wants to avoid is going to \\(B\\) if the other goes to\n\\(A\\). If either of them arrives at \\(B\\) alone, she not only misses\ndinner but must pay the exorbitant parking fee of the hotel which\nhouses \\(B\\), since the headwaiter of \\(B\\) refuses to validate the\nparking ticket of anyone who asks for a table for two and then sits\nalone. This is what Harsanyi (1967) terms a game of incomplete\ninformation, since the game\u2019s payoffs depend upon states\nwhich not all the agents know.\n\n\\(A\\) is a \u201cplay-it-safe\u201d strategy for both Joanna and\n Lizzi.[33]\n By choosing \\(A\\) whatever the state of the world happens to be, the\nagents run the risk that they will fail to get the positive payoff of\nmeeting where Aldo is, but each is also sure to avoid the really bad\nconsequence of choosing \\(B\\) if the other chooses \\(A\\). And since\nonly Lizzi knows the state of the world, neither can use information\nregarding the state of the world to improve their prospects for\ncoordination. For Joanna has no such information, and since Lizzi\nknows this, she knows that Joanna has to choose accordingly, so Lizzi\nmust choose her best response to the move she anticipates Joanna to\nmake regardless of the state of the world Lizzi observes. Apparently\nLizzi and Joanna cannot achieve expected payoffs greater than 1.02 for\neach, their expected payoffs if they choose \\((A, A)\\) at either state\nof the world.\n\nIf the state \\(\\omega\\) were common knowledge, then the conditional\nstrategy profile \\((A, A)\\) if \\(\\omega = \\omega_1\\) and \\((B, B)\\),\nif \\(\\omega = \\omega_2\\) would be a strict Nash equilibrium at which\neach would achieve a payoff of 2. So the obvious remedy to their\npredicament would be for Lizzi to tell Joanna Aldo\u2019s location in\na face-to-face or telephone conversation and for them to agree to go\nwhere Aldo is, which would make the state \\(\\omega\\) and their\nintentions to coordinate on the best outcome given \\(\\omega\\) common\nknowledge between them. Suppose for some reason they cannot talk to\neach other, but they prearrange that Lizzi will send Joanna an e-mail\nmessage if, and only if, \\(\\omega_2\\) occurs. Suppose further that\nJoanna\u2019s and Lizzi\u2019s e-mail systems are set up to send a\nreply message automatically to the sender of any message received and\nviewed, and that due to technical problems there is a small\nprobability, \\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\), that any message can fail to\narrive at its destination. Then if Lizzi sends Joanna a message, and\nreceives an automatic confirmation, then Lizzi knows that Joanna knows\nthat \\(\\omega_2\\) has occurred. If Joanna receives an automatic\nconfirmation of Lizzi\u2019s automatic confirmation, then Joanna\nknows that Lizzi knows that Joanna knows that \\(\\omega_2\\) occurred,\nand so on. That \\(\\omega_2\\) has occurred would become common\nknowledge if each agent received infinitely many automatic\nconfirmations, assuming that all the confirmations could be sent and\nreceived in a finite amount of\n time.[34]\n However, because of the probability \\(\\varepsilon\\) of transmission\nfailure at every stage of communication, the sequence of confirmations\nstops after finitely many stages with probability one. With\nprobability one, therefore, the agents fail to achieve full common\nknowledge. But they do at least achieve something \u201cclose\u201d\nto common knowledge. Does this imply that they have good prospects of\nsettling upon \\((B, B)\\)?\n\nRubinstein shows by induction that if the number of automatically\nexchanged confirmation messages is finite, then \\(A\\) is the only\nchoice that maximizes expected utility for each agent, given what she\nknows about what they both know.\n\nRubinstein\u2019s Proof\n\n\nSo even if agents have \u201calmost\u201d common knowledge, in the\nsense that the number of levels of knowledge in \u201cJoanna knows\nthat Lizzi knows that \u2026 that Joanna knows that \\(\\omega_2\\)\noccurred\u201d is very large, their behavior is quite different from\ntheir behavior given common knowledge that \\(\\omega_2\\) has occurred.\nIndeed, as Rubinstein points out, given merely \u201calmost\u201d\ncommon knowledge, the agents choose as if no communication had\noccurred at all! Rubinstein also notes that this result violates our\nintuitions about what we would expect the agents to do in this case.\n(See Rubinstein 1992, p. 324.) If \\(T_i = 17\\), wouldn\u2019t we\nexpect agent \\(i\\) to choose \\(B\\)? Indeed, in many actual situations\nwe might think it plausible that the agents would each expect the\nother to choose \\(B\\) even if \\(T_1 = T_2 = 2\\), which is all that is\nneeded for Lizzi to know that Joanna has received her original message\nand for Joanna to know that Lizzi knows this! Binmore and Samelson\n(2001) in fact show that if Joanna and Lizzi incur a cost when paying\nattention to the messages they exchange, or if sending a message is\ncostly, then longer streams of messages are not paid attention to or\ndo not occur, respectively.\n\nLederman (2018a) proposes a radical solution to the paradoxes. In the\ncase of the coordinated attack, he argues that rational\ngenerals who commonly know that they are rational will attack if (and\nonly if) they have common knowledge that they will attack; since\ncommon knowledge is not attainable by exchanging messages, they will\nnot attack. However, admitting that the generals do not commonly\nbelieve that they are rational, a simple model can be built showing\nthat such generals do attack without common knowledge that they will.\nSimilarly, in the case of the e-mail game, he shows that if players\ncan be of an irrational type (so that she chooses game \\(B\\) even if\nher expected payoff is lower than for choosing game \\(A\\),) and one\nplayer believes with sufficiently high probability that the other\nplayer is of the irrational type, then players can coordinate on game\n\\(B\\) after a finite number of messages have been exchanged. Thus,\nLederman (2018a) argues that we should take common knowledge of\nrationality to be a simplifying assumption, useful to produce\ntractable mathematical models and yet generally false \u201cin the\nwild,\u201d where a commonsense notion of rationality does let\ngenerals and laymen easily coordinate after a small number of message\nexchanges. Thomason (2021) takes issue with Lederman\u2019s use of\nthe notion of commonsense rationality, and argues about the importance\nof considering instead the cognitive and deliberative processes that\nlead to the emergence of both individual and commonly held attitudes.\nDespite their disagreement, both Lederman (2018a, 2018b) and Thomason\n(2021) emphasize the importance of the relation between (commonly)\nheld beliefs or knowledge and practical reasoning. An interesting\napplication of practical issues pertaining to the attainability of\ncommon knowledge is offered in Halpern and Pass (2017), where a\nblockchain protocol (and consensus and hence coordination therein) is\nanalyzed in terms of suitable weakenings of the notion of common\n knowledge.[35]\n5.2 Common \\(p\\)-Belief\n\nThe example in Section 5.1 hints that mutual knowledge is not the only\nweakening of common knowledge that is relevant to coordination.\nBrandenburger and Dekel (1987) and\u00a0Monderer and Samet (1989)\nexplore another option, which is to weaken the properties of the\n\\(\\mathbf{K}^{*}_N\\) operator. Monderer and Samet motivate this\napproach by noting that even if a mutual knowledge hierarchy stops at\na certain level, agents might still have higher level mutual\nbeliefs about the proposition in question. So they replace\nthe knowledge operator \\(\\mathbf{K}_i\\) with a belief\noperator \\(\\mathbf{B}^p_i\\):\n\n\nDefinition 5.1\n\nIf \\(\\mu_i(\\cdot)\\) is agent \\(i\\)\u2019s probability distribution\nover \\(\\Omega\\), then \n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}^p_i(A) = \\{\\omega \\mid \\mu_i (A \\mid \\mathcal{H}_i (\\omega)) \\ge p \\}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{B}^p_i(A)\\) is to be read \u2018\\(i\\) believes \\(A\\) (given\n\\(i\\)\u2019s private information) with probability at least \\(p\\) at\n\\(\\omega\\)\u2019, or \u2018\\(i\\) \\(p\\)-believes \\(A\\)\u2019. The\nbelief operator \\(\\mathbf{B}^p_i\\) satisfies axioms K2, K3, and K4 of\nthe knowledge operator. \\(\\mathbf{B}^p_i\\) does not satisfy K1, but\ndoes satisfy the weaker property \n\n\\[\n\\mu_i (A \\mid \\mathbf{B}^p_i(A)) \\ge p\n\\]\n\n\nthat is, if one believes \\(A\\) with probability at least \\(p\\), then\nthe probability of \\(A\\) is indeed at least \\(p\\).\n\nOne can define mutual and common p-beliefs\nrecursively in a manner similar to the definition of mutual and common\nknowledge:\n\n\nDefinition 5.2\n\nLet a set \\(\\Omega\\) of possible worlds together with a set of agents\n\\(N\\) be given.\n\n\n(1) The proposition that \\(A\\) is (first level or first order)\nmutual p-belief for the agents of \\(N, \\mathbf{B}^p_{N^1}(A),\\)\nis the set defined by \n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}^p_{N^1}(A) \\equiv \\bigcap_{i\\in N} \\mathbf{B}^p_i(A).\n\\]\n\n\n(2) The proposition that \\(A\\) is \\(m\\)th level\n(or \\(m\\)th order) mutual\\(p\\)-belief\namong the agents of \\(N, \\mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A),\\) is defined\nrecursively as the set \n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A) \\equiv \\bigcap_{i\\in N} \\mathbf{B}^p_i (\\mathbf{B}^p_{N^{m-1}}(A))\n\\]\n\n\n(3) The proposition that \\(A\\) is common p-belief among the\nagents of \\(N, \\mathbf{B}^p_{N^*}(A),\\) is defined as the set\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}^p_{N^*}(A) \\equiv \\bigcap_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A).\n\\]\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) is common (or \\(m\\)th level mutual) knowledge at\nworld \\(\\omega\\), then \\(A\\) is common \\((m\\)th level)\n\\(p\\)-belief at \\(\\omega\\) for every value of \\(p\\). So mutual and\ncommon \\(p\\)-beliefs formally generalize the mutual and common\nknowledge concepts. However, note that \\(\\mathbf{B}^1_{N^*}(A)\\) is\nnot necessarily the same proposition as \\(\\mathbf{K}^{*}_N (A)\\), that\nis, even if \\(A\\) is common 1-belief, \\(A\\) can fail to be common\nknowledge.\n\nCommon \\(p\\)-belief forms a hierarchy similar to a common knowledge\nhierarchy:\n\n\nProposition 5.3\n\n\\(\\omega \\in \\mathbf{B}^{p}_{N^m}(A)\\) iff\n\n(\u2217) For all agents \\(i_1, i_2 , \\ldots ,i_m \\in N,\\) \\(\\omega\n\\in \\mathbf{B}^{p}_{i_1}\\mathbf{B}^p_{i_2} \\ldots\n\\mathbf{B}^p_{i_m}(A)\\)\n\nHence, \\(\\omega \\in \\mathbf{B}^{p}_{N^*}(A)\\) iff (\u2217) is the\ncase for each \\(m \\ge 1.\\)\n\nProof. Similar to the\n Proof of Proposition 2.5.\n\n\nOne can draw several morals from the e-mail game of Example 5.1.\nRubinstein (1987) argues that his conclusion seems paradoxical for the\nsame reason the backwards induction solution of Alan\u2019s and\nFiona\u2019s perfect information game might seem paradoxical:\nMathematical induction does not appear to be part of our\n\u201ceveryday\u201d reasoning. This game also shows that in order\nfor A to be a common truism for a set of agents, they ordinarily must\nperceive an event which implies A simultaneously in each\nothers\u2019 presence. A third moral is that in some cases, it may\nmake sense for the agents to employ some solution concept weaker than\nNash or correlated equilibrium. In their analysis of the e-mail game,\nMonderer and Samet (1989) introduce the notions of ex ante\nand ex post \\(\\varepsilon\\)-equilibrium. An ex ante\nequilibrium \\(h\\) is a system of strategy profiles such that no agent\n\\(i\\) expects to gain more than \\(\\varepsilon\\)-utiles if \\(i\\)\ndeviates from \\(h\\). An ex post equilibrium \\(h'\\) is a\nsystem of strategy profiles such that no agent \\(i\\) expects to gain\nmore than \\(\\varepsilon\\)-utiles by deviating from \\(h'\\) given\n\\(i\\)\u2019s private information. When \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\), these\nconcepts coincide, and \\(h\\) is a Nash equilibrium. Monderer and Samet\nshow that, while the agents in the e-mail game can never achieve\ncommon knowledge of the world \\(\\omega\\), if they have common\n\\(p\\)-belief of \\(\\omega\\) for sufficiently high \\(p\\), then there is\nan ex ante equilibrium at which they follow \\((A,A)\\) if\n\\(\\omega = \\omega_1\\) and \\((B,B)\\), if \\(\\omega = \\omega_2\\). This\nequilibrium turns out not to be ex post. However, if the\nsituation is changed so that there are no replies, then Lizzi and\nJoanna could have at most first order mutual knowledge that \\(\\omega =\n\\omega_2\\). Monderer and Samet show that in this situation, given\nsufficiently high common \\(p\\)-belief that \\(\\omega = \\omega_2\\),\nthere is an ex post equilibrium at which Joanna and Lizzi\nchoose \\((B,B)\\) if \\(\\omega = \\omega_2\\)! So another way one might\nview this third moral of the e-mail game is that agents\u2019\nprospects for coordination can sometimes improve dramatically if they\nrely on their common beliefs as well as their mutual knowledge. More\nrecently, the notion of \\(p\\)-belief and \\(p\\)-common belief proved\nuseful (Paternotte, 2011) to analyze and formalize Lewis\u2019s\naccount of common knowledge, while Paternotte (2017), establishing a\nlink between \u201cordinary\u201d common knowledge and \\(p\\)-common\nbelief, uses the latter to show that only a limited number of\nexchanges in the e-mail game or coordinated attack paradox would be\nsufficient to determine coordination. The result, building on\nfoundations provided by Leitgeb (2014), is used to show that our\n\u201cordinary\u201d understanding of common knowledge is captured\nby probabilistic common belief, although at the price of decreased\nrobustness relative to the number of individuals sharing common belief\nand their awareness.",
