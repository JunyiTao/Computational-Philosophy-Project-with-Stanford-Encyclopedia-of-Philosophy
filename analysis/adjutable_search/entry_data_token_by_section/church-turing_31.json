Quantum computation researchers\nBernstein and Vazirani say:\n\n\nJust as the theory of computability has its foundations in the\nChurch-Turing thesis, computational complexity theory rests upon a\nmodern strengthening of this thesis. (Bernstein & Vazirani 1997:\n1411)\n\n\nThere are in fact two different complexity-theoretic versions of the\nChurch-Turing thesis in the modern computer science literature. Both\nare referred to as the \u201cExtended Church-Turing thesis\u201d.\nThe first was presented by Yao in 2003:\n\n\nThe Extended Church-Turing Thesis (ECT) makes the \u2026\nassertion that the Turing machine model is also as efficient as any\ncomputing device can be. That is, if a function is computable by some\nhardware device in time \\(T(n)\\) for input of size \\(n\\), then it is\ncomputable by a Turing machine in time \\((T(n))^k\\) for some fixed\n\\(k\\) (dependent on the problem). (Yao 2003: 100\u2013101)\n\n\nYao points out that ECT has a powerful implication:\n\n\nat least in principle, to make future computers more efficient, one\nonly needs to focus on improving the implementation technology of\npresent-day computer designs. (2003: 101)\n\n\nUnlike the original Church-Turing thesis (whose status is\n\u201csomething between\u201d a theorem and a definition) ECT is\nneither a logico-mathematical theorem nor a definition. If it is true,\nthen its truth is a consequence of the laws of physics\u2014and it\nmight not be true. (Although it is trivial if, contrary to a standard\nbut unproved assumption in computer science, P = NP.)\n\nThe second complexity-theoretic version of the thesis involves the\nconcept of a probabilistic Turing machine (due to Rabin &\nScott 1959). Vazirani and Aharonov state the thesis:\n\n\n[T]he extended Church-Turing thesis \u2026 asserts that any\nreasonable computational model can be simulated efficiently by the\nstandard model of classical computation, namely, a probabilistic\nTuring machine. (Aharonov & Vazirani 2013: 329)\n\n\nThese two related theses differ considerably from the original\nChurch-Turing thesis, not least in that both extended theses are\nempirical hypotheses. Moreover, there is ongoing debate as to\nwhether quantum computers in fact falsify these theses. (For an\nintroduction to this debate see Copeland & Shagrir 2019, and for a\nmore detailed treatment see Aharonov & Vazirani 2013.)\n",
