Presupposition variability\n\nMuch contemporary work on presupposition has been devoted to case\nstudies of particular triggers or families of triggers. More often\nthan not, these studies end up granting some sort of special\nconsideration to the trigger(s) in question. We have already seen\ninstances of trigger differentiation above;\u00a0for example,\nanaphoric accounts identify a class of triggers whose content is\n\"descriptively poor\" to explain why their presuppositions are more\ndifficult to accommodate than those of other triggers (see Sections\n5.1 & 5.3). Researchers have noted more and more ways in which the\npresuppositions of triggers differ, mostly focused around questions of\nhow robustly the presupposition projects and in what sorts of contexts\nthe presupposition disappears.\n\nFor some, the blurry boundaries between the sorts of inferences that\nare covered by presupposition theories have opened up the door for new\ntriggers and presupposition-like things that might not be covered by\ntraditional labels. For example, Schlenker (2015, 2018) applies a\npresuppositional framework to iconic co-speech gestures, to identify\nwhat he calls \"cosuppositions.\" There are also inferences that seem to\nchallenge traditional diagnostics like projection. For instance,\nnon-restrictive relative clauses (\"Fred, who I like, ...\") produce\nprojection like presuppositions, but typically introduce new\ninformation to the discourse (Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet\n1990).\n\nFinally, the way that some theories model presuppositions can give\nrise to new types of related inferences. For example, Chemla (2008)\nnotes that the sentence in (54a) strongly suggests that the speaker\ndoes not have a sister. According to Heim (1991), this inference\narises from the fact that the speaker did not utter the alternative in\n(54b), which strongly presupposes that the speaker does have a sister.\nThis prediction follows from Heim\u2019s Maximize Presupposition!\nprinciple, that a speaker will use the felicitous sentence with the\nstrongest presupposition among a set of alternatives. These types of\ninferences have been referred to in the literature as\n\u2019anti-presuppositions,\u2019 a term originating with Percus (2006).\n\n(54a) John believes I have a sister.\n\n(54b) John knows I have a sister.\n\nOne observed difference between some triggers is that they don\u2019t seem\nto reliably generate presuppositions in certain contexts. As we\nmentioned in Section 6, theories of presupposition projection tend to\nadopt the working hypothesis that presuppositions are associated with\nexpression types: if an expression \u03b1 triggers a presupposition\n\u03c6, then \u03c6 will always be triggered by \u03b1. This is just a\nmatter of economy: since a projection theory already provides a\nmechanism for explaining how presuppositions, once triggered, can seem\nto disappear, there is no need for supposing that there are part-time\npresupposition triggers. Indeed, it would be a bit of a nuisance if it\nturned out that that some expressions or constructions trigger their\npresuppositions on a part-time basis, because then we would have two\nways of explaining why a given presupposition fails to appear: echoing\nour discussion in section 6, either it has been canceled (say through\nbeing resolved in an embedded context) or it wasn\u2019t triggered in the\nfirst place.\n\nAre there compelling reasons for believing that there are part-time\ntriggers? Not as far as we know. There are suggestive facts, though.\nIn the following example from Fauconnier (1985), A and\nB are sitting in a bar observing a stranger who doesn\u2019t seem\nto be too happy:\n\n(55)\nA: I wonder why that guy is looking so glum.\n\nB: Maybe his girlfriend jilted him.\n\n\nThe most natural interpretation of B\u2019s answer, in this\ncontext, is that it is possible that the stranger has a girlfriend who\nhas jilted him; this construal will require local accommodation of the\ngirlfriend if we assume that \u201chis girlfriend\u201d always\ntriggers the presupposition that the pronoun\u2019s referent has a\n girlfriend.[23]\n The problem is that if this is local accommodation, then it\u2019s too\neasy. Local accommodation is supposed to be dispreferred. If\nwe allow that in this case the presupposition is locally accommodated,\nwhy can\u2019t all embedded presuppositions just be locally accommodated\naway and not project? Allowing local accommodation to occur without\nconstraint would potentially destroy any claim to have explained the\nobservation that has defined the phenomenon of presupposition since\nits inception, the observation that presuppositions tend to\nproject.\n\nIf we could explain why this or that expression triggers such\nand such a presupposition, one of the corollaries might be that the\nexpression in question is a part-time trigger. To see how such an\nargument might run in outline, consider the presuppositions associated\nwith aspectual verbs like \u201cstart\u201d or\n\u201cstop\u201d:\n\n(56a)\nJill has started smoking pot.\n\n\u2192 Jill didn\u2019t use to smoke pot.\n(56b)\nJill has stopped smoking pot.\n\n\u2192 Jill used to smoke pot.\n\n\nAspectual verbs describe a transition from one state to another, and\nit is always the first state that is presupposed, as standard\nprojection tests confirm. An explanation might be sought in the idea\nthat interlocutors are more interested in where the story is going\nthan where it came from, and therefore tend to take the past as given.\nA purely pragmatic analysis might involve the hearer reasoning that\nsince the speaker is likely to intend to provide the information that\nis of greatest interest, they are probably assuming a context in which\nthe pre-state associated with a telic sentence is already in the\ncommon ground, i.e. presupposed. It might further be argued that such\nreasoning only applies when the hearer has reason to think that the\nspeaker has expertise on the situation being described. A part-time\ntrigger analysis might be based on the idea that the regularity with\nwhich pre-states of telic sentences are in the common ground has led\nto this pragmatic reasoning being conventionalized. A part-time\ntrigger analysis might involve a special triggering condition, e.g.\ninvolving the speaker\u2019s expertise. So the part-time trigger analysis\nmight amount to the claim that when the context determines that the\nspeaker has expertise about an event, the pre-state is presupposed,\nbut when the context determines that the speaker lacks expertise,\nthere is no such presupposition.\n\nThe disappearance of a pre-state presupposition in example (57) could\nbe explained in this way. On a more standard view, the aspectual verb\ntriggers a quantified presupposition, roughly that x used to\nsmoke. This has to be accommodated locally, perhaps because as\nsuggested by van der Sandt (1992), bound presuppositions can never be\naccommodated outside of the scope of the binder, what he calls\ntrapping. But it is also conceivable that there is no\npresupposition to be trapped. The idea would be that the speaker lacks\nexpertise on the habits of the arbitrary individuals quantified over\nby the quantifier \"anyone\", and that this is just the situation in\nwhich a presupposition is not triggered. The ease with which the\nexistence presupposition of the possessive in example (55) disappears\ncould be explained along the same lines.\n\n(57)\nIf anyone stops smoking before July 1, they are eligible for a\npayment from the Tobacco Indemnity Fund. (Example adapted from\nAbusch 2002.)\n\n\nA different perspective has emerged in recent years to explain the why\ncertain triggers seem to only result in a presupposition part of the\ntime. Rather than proposing that there is variation in triggering,\nsome linguists interpret this behavior as the result of variation in\nthe inherent cancellability among triggers. Abusch (2002, 2010)\ndistinguishes between \u2018soft\u2019 triggers which are weak and\ncontext-dependent and \u2018hard\u2019 triggers, which are resistent to\ncancellation. For example, she classifies the achievement verb\nwin, in (58a), as a soft trigger, since the presupposition\nthat John participated in the race is contextually defeasible, whereas\nthe cleft construction in (58b) is considered a hard trigger because\nit cannot be cancelled by the speaker by explicitly expressing\nignorance.\n\n(58a)\n I have no idea whether John ended up participating in the Road\nRace yesterday. But if he won it, then he has more victories than\nanyone else in history.\n(58b)\n ??I have no idea whether anyone read that letter. But if it is\nJohn who read it, let\u2019s ask him to be discreet about the content.\n\n\nAbusch\u2019s soft/hard distinction suggests that degrees of cancellability\nare intrinsic properties of the triggers themselves, and those that\nbuy into this theory must motivate why that is. For Abusch,\nhard presuppositions are strictly semantic, whereas soft\npresuppositions arise from alternative sets generated in the context.\nRomoli (2011, 2014) takes this a step further by arguing that\npresuppositions from soft triggers aren\u2019t presuppositions at all, but\nrather entailments or scalar implicatures. In contrast, Abrus\u00e1n\n(2011a, 2011b, 2016) argues that the difference between soft and hard\ntriggers emerges from how both types interact with the context, for\nexample with regard to their focus sensitivity.\n\nDespite the arguments made for a distinction between soft and hard\ntriggers, empirical studies have challenged the view that triggers\ndiffer in their conventional properties. Jayez et al (2014)\nfind\u00a0that projection differences between different triggers\ndepend more on context than on the classification of the trigger\nitself. Schwarz (2014) compares processing times between hard and soft\ntriggers and finds that there is no difference between the two.\n\nWith the rise of arguments for more fine-grained variability among\npresuppositions, inferences that we may have confidently called\n\u2019presuppositions\u2019 have become harder to think of as forming a natural\nclass. For some, the inconsistency in trigger behavior has fed into\nsomething of a presupposition identity crisis, a crisis dating at\nleast as far back as B\u00f6er and Lycan\u2019s (1976) description of\nsemantic presupposition as a \"myth\". Karttunen (2016) reflects on the\nstate of the field with an air of regret, saying that the \"veritable\nzoo\" of triggers that were lumped into the same presuppositional cage\nshould never have been considered the same species in the first place.\nUltimately, in order to either salvage a unified notion of\npresupposition, or else argue in a grand tradition (following e.g.\nB\u00f6er and Lycan 1976 or Karttunen and Peters 1977) for rejecting\nthe possibility of a unified notion of presupposition, it has become\npressing for linguists to understand how triggers and their inferences\nvary and why, fueling a trend in recent years towards systematic\nempirical work, looking for evidence of cross-linguistic variation,\nand developing methods for experimentally testing the predictions of\ndifferent theories.\n",
