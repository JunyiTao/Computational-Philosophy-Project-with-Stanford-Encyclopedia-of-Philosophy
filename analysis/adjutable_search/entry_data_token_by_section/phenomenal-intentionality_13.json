    "main_text": "Arguments for PIT || Intentional states about non-existents\n4.6 Intentional states about non-existents\n\nRelationalism about intentionality is the view that\nintentionality is a relation to distinctly existing entities that\nserve as contents. Non-relationalism about intentionality\nis the view that\nintentionality is not a relation to distinctly existing entities that\nserve as contents. \n\nKriegel (2007, 2011a) argues that a non-relational view of intentionality\nprovides the best explanation of how we can represent things that\ndon\u2019t exist, such as Bigfoot, and that PIT is the best candidate\nnon-relational view of intentionality. Kriegel first argues that the\nfollowing three intuitively appealing claims are inconsistent:\n\n(a) One\ncan represent non-existents.\n (b) One\ncannot bear a relation to non-existents.\n (c) Representing\nsomething involves (constitutively) bearing a\nrelation to it. (Kriegel 2007: 308)\n\n\nOne of these claims needs to be rejected. Kriegel argues that it is\n (c),\n the claim that asserts relationalism. His\u2019s argument\nproceeds by a process of elimination.\n\nKriegel considers rejecting\n (a).\n On this proposal, when we seem to represent dragons, Bigfoot, or\nSanta Claus, we either fail to have an intentional state or we\nrepresent something else. One reason Kriegel rejects the first option\nis that it implies that there is a gap between trying to represent and\nrepresenting, which he takes to be implausible. On the second option,\nwhen we seem to represent non-existent concrete entities, we are\nreally just representing something else, such as existent abstract\nentities (e.g., universals or propositions), existent mental entities\n(e.g., sense data or ideas), or existent possible but non-actual\nentities. But Kriegel takes this option to be highly counterintuitive.\nWhen we seem to be thinking about concrete flesh-and-blood Bigfoot, we\nare in fact thinking about an abstract or mental entity. (See, however, Mendelovici 2018, section 9.3.1 for a response to this line of argument.)\nAnother worry\nis that accounting for the representation of non-existents seems like\nthe wrong kind of reason to accept the existence of these abstract,\nmental, or merely possible entities.\n\nAnother option is to reject\n (b).\n Kriegel argues that just as a monadic property cannot be instantiated\nwithout an existing particular that instantiates it, so too a relation\ncannot be instantiated without existing particulars that instantiate\nit. In short, it is a general rule that relations require relata.\nRejecting\n (b)\n is tantamount to claiming that the intentionality relation is an\nexception to this general rule, which is implausible.\n\nKriegel concludes that we should reject\n (c).\n He calls his non-relational view \u201cadverbialism\u201d, since it\ndraws its inspiration from the adverbialist views of perception of\nDucasse (1942) and Chisholm (1957). According to Kriegel\u2019s\nadverbialism, representing Bigfoot is not standing in a relation to an\nentity, but rather instantiating a non-relational intentional\nproperty, which we might describe as the property of representing\nBigfoot-wise.\n\nSo far, this only motivates adverbialism. The final step of the\nargument motivates PIT: One objection to adverbialism is that it is\nmysterious what non-relational intentional properties are. What is it\nto represent Bigfoot-wise? Kriegel suggests that a plausible account\nof these properties is that they are phenomenal properties. Phenomenal\nproperties are usually taken to be non-relational and there is\nindependent reason to think they give rise to intentionality (see the\nother arguments in this section). The resulting picture is one on\nwhich phenomenal intentionality is non-relational. Kriegel suggests\nthat this view can be combined with the view that non-phenomenal\nintentionality is derived from phenomenal intentionality and is\nrelational. \n\nIn short, Kriegel\u2019s argument attempts to show that PIT is the\nbest way to account for the representation of non-existents.\n\nThis argument motivates non-relational versions of PIT. However, it\ndoes not motivate relational versions of PIT, on which intentionality\nis relational. Loar (2003a), Pitt (2009), Kriegel (2007, 2011a), and\nMendelovici (2010, 2018) hold non-relational versions of PIT, while Pautz\n(2013) and Bourget (forthcoming-a, forthcoming-c) defend a relational version of PIT, on which both phenomenal properties and intentional properties are relational. Speaks (2015) also defends a relational view of phenomenal representation (without endorsing PIT).\n\nArguing in the direction opposite the preceding considerations, some have challenged PIT on the grounds that intentionality is relational. Ott (2016) raises worries for PIT along such lines, arguing that most versions of PIT fail to adequately explain how phenomenal consciousness can give rise to intentionality, which he takes to necessarily involve a relation to extra-mental reality.\nThere are two lines of response open to phenomenal intentionalists: One is to maintain that phenomenal consciousness is itself relational in the relevant way. Pautz (2010) and Bourget (forthcoming-a, forthcoming-c) argue that consciousness is a relation to items in extra-mental reality, such as clusters of abstract properties or abstract propositions. Of course, this response gives up on the benefits of non-relational PIT alleged by Kriegel. (Bourget (forthcoming-c) responds to some of Kriegel\u2019s arguments against relationalism.)\nAnother response is to deny that intentionality secures the required relation to extra-mental reality. Along such lines, Mendelovici (2018, sections 1.3.4 and 9.3.4) argues that it is a substantive question whether intentionality on its own or with the help of additional ingredients secures such a relation. Of course, whether this is so depends on what exactly we mean by \u201cintentionality\u201d. If intentionality involves such a relation by definition, then there is no further substantive question to be asked. But if, as Mendelovici (2010, 2018) and Kriegel (2010) suggest, the core notion of intentionality leaves open this aspect of its nature, it might very well turn out that intentionality does not involve such relations. \nEven if intentionality does not involve a relation to extra-mental reality, one might worry that it should at least play a role in facilitating such a relation and that PIT cannot allow for this. But Ott (2016) suggests that PIT can in fact connect us to extra-mental reality through relations of resemblance. Similarly, Mendelovici (2018, chapter 9) argues that intentionality does not involve a connection to extra-mental reality but that truth and reference do and that truth and reference are a matter of a special kind of superficial resemblance called \u201cmatching\u201d. Woodward (forthcoming-b) and Bourget (forthcoming-b) challenge Mendelovici\u2019s account of truth and reference for non-relational versions of PIT. \n",
