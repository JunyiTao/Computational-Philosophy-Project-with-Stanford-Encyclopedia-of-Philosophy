    "main_text": "Sociobiology as Human Behavioral Ecology\n3. Sociobiology as Human Behavioral Ecology\n\nHuman behavioral ecology (HBE), or human evolutionary ecology, is the\ncurrent evolutionary social science most closely related to\nWilson\u2019s sociobiological project; it is the project that is\nsometimes still referred to as \u201csociobiology\u201d by some\nphilosophers of science (Griffiths, 2008; Sterelny and Griffiths,\n1999). \u201cSociobiology\u201d is most often used this way as a\nterm of contrast with \u201cevolutionary psychology\u201d, another\ncurrent evolutionary social science project inspired by early\nsociobiologists, and also much developed from how early sociobiology\nwas conceived: see the entry on\n evolutionary psychology\n for a discussion. Other common names for HBE are \u201cevolutionary\nanthropology\u201d (Smith, 2000) or \u201cDarwinian ecological\nanthropology\u201d (Vayda, 1995) (due to most of its practitioners\nhaving a background in, or being based in anthropology departments,\nand using anthropological fieldwork as the main means of testing their\nhypotheses about human behavior). The different names tend to be used\nwhen the researchers concerned are emphasizing the connections of\ntheir field with anthropology or with non-human behavioral ecology.\nHBE has a great deal in common with the non-human behavioral ecology\ndescribed above. In particular, it shares its focus on behavior,\nrather than the psychological mechanisms described in evolutionary\npsychology. Unlike non-human behavioral ecology it has continued to\nuse Grafen\u2019s (1984) phenotypic gambit, in that its practitioners\nusually do not attempt to discover or describe the genetic or other\nresources employed in the development of the behavior in which they\nare interested; nor, for that matter, do they usually attempt to\ndiscover the underlying psychology. There are, however, some\ndifferences of emphasis, in that the questions about human behavior\naddressed by the human behavioral ecologists (HBEs) are sometimes\ndifferent from those addressed by the non-human behavioral\necologists.\n\nTo understand the purposes of the HBE project, let\u2019s consider one\nof its classic examples: Kaplan and Hill\u2019s (1992) work on prey\nchoice strategies amongst the Ache foragers of Paraguay. Just as in\nnon-human behavioral ecology, behavioral strategies in HBE are usually\ndescribed as complex behavioral dispositions. Behavioral dispositions\ninvolve behavioral responses to local stimuli; behavioral strategies\nthen involve producing a set of different responses to a set of\ndifferent stimuli (i.e. the response conditions of the\nstrategy). According to Kaplan and Hill, the Ache prey choice strategy\ninvolves choosing a variety of different potential prey items from the\nenvironment; whether or not a prey item is taken depends on a number\nof circumstances acting as the response conditions: for example, the\npresence of prey with certain specific features, such as the caloric\nreturn of the prey given the time necessary to process it (known as\nthe profitability); the rate at which that prey occurs in the\nenvironment; whether or not the prey is encountered on their search;\nand the search time available on a foraging trip. HBEs usually\ndescribe behavioral strategies in terms of an \u201cepigenetic\u201d\nor decision rule, which is usually given as a mathematical function\nmapping values for the response conditions in the environment onto the\nappropriate values for the parameters of the behavioral output. Kaplan\nand Hill\u2019s work also provides such an epigenetic rule (see\nKaplan and Hill, 1992, 170), which describes the relationships between\nsearch time, profitability and so on, to decide which prey will be\ntaken on encounter when the Ache are out foraging. Kaplan and\nHill\u2019s observations suggest that, on the whole, the Ache are using\na strategy which is close to the maximally adaptive strategy suggested\nby their prey choice model. The question, then, is how to interpret\nKaplan and Hill\u2019s method; what is the purpose of showing that the\nAche have a strategy of this kind?\n\nIn a few places, remarks by human behavioral ecologists suggest that\nthe purpose of HBE is simply to demonstrate that human behavior is\nmaximally adaptive: for example, Smith et al. (2001, 128) claim that\n\u201c\u2026 human behavioral ecology applies the theoretical perspective\nof animal behavioral ecology to human populations, examining the\ndegree to which behavior is adaptively adjusted to environmental\n(including social) conditions\u201d. One possible interpretation of HBE\nwork, therefore, is that they test the hypothesis that human behavior\nis adaptive (in contrast to the hypothesis that it consists of\nadaptations). By using methods derived from non-human behavioral\necology (such as optimality and game theoretic models), HBEs can\ndemonstrate that the behaviors humans actually engage in tend to be\noptimal relative to the constraints and tradeoffs acting on them (i.e.\nthey are \u201clocally optimal\u201d). Kaplan and Hill seek to\ndemonstrate that the Ache\u2019s prey choice behavior is in fact\nadaptive, as do other HBE studies that use the same method. On this\ninterpretation, an important purpose of the project is to deflect some\nof the criticisms directed at Pop Sociobiology: HBEs explicitly accept\nthat social learning of general purpose reasoning may be responsible\nfor human behavioral strategies such as the Ache\u2019s. However, this\nis ultimately irrelevant; one way or another, natural selection has,\nin effect, \u201cseen to it\u201d that humans behave in ways that tend\nto maximize their reproductive success. This is also consistent with\nthe HBEs\u2019 emphasis on the phenotypic gambit.\n\nAlternatively, however, one could take these remarks to be a\ndescription of the HBEs primary method rather than the nature of their\nhypotheses, and that their hypotheses are (as the above quote also\nsuggests) similar to those of non-human behavioral ecology. This is\nconsistent with other theoretical discussions of HBE work including\nsome by the same authors\u2014see for example, Irons (1998), Smith\n(2000), Winterhalder and Smith (1992). On this interpretation, the\npurpose of Kaplan and Hill\u2019s work is to test the hypothesis that\nhumans have a behavioral adaptation for prey choice, of which the\nAche\u2019s prey choice strategy is only a local\nmanifestation. Showing that the Ache\u2019s behavior is highly\nadaptive is supposed to be a local test of the hypothesis: the Ache\nare a group that have to engage in prey choice and hence it is\npossible to test for a human behavioral adaptation in this context. By\nconfirming this hypothesis, Kaplan and Hill can then achieve two\nfurther goals: they can determine which conditions led to the\nevolution of the larger prey choice strategy and, by confirming a\nfunctional description of that strategy, they can determine what\ncauses the Ache (specifically) to choose the prey they do in their\nlocal environment.\n\nOn this interpretation, the prey choice strategy as a whole (i.e. not,\nfor example, the Ache\u2019s specific, locally appropriate\nset of prey choices, but the general human prey choice strategy of\nwhich they are a manifestation) is presumed for heuristic purposes to\nbe an adaptation to certain conditions in the past that led to that\nstrategy being selected for; i.e. the selection conditions\nfor the strategy. Supposing that it is reasonable to take behavioral\nstrategies as such to be able to be adaptations (see the later\ndiscussion in section 4) the selection conditions of a given\nbehavioral strategy will usually include the response conditions\n(because presumably it takes the production of overt behavior in order\nfor selection to act on a behavioral strategy) but possibly also\nfeatures of the larger context which made it highly adaptive to\nrespond in that way to those response conditions. In other words, in\nthe prey choice case, profitabilities, prey densities and search time\navailability would presumably have been among the selection conditions\nof a prey choice strategy (presuming it is an adaptation). But so\nwould larger details about the environment not explicitly included in\nthese models, such as the limits on human capacity which determine\nwhich prey are accessible in that environment, the ecology which\ndetermines which prey are in the environment, and so on. On this\ninterpretation, therefore, HBEs are interested in identifying the\nselection conditions of human behavioral strategies; this parallels\nstandard interpretations of non-human behavioral ecology described\nearlier.\n\nHowever, HBEs are anthropologists, and hence also want to describe the\nlocal causes of the overt behaviors they observe people engaging in in\ntheir fieldwork; this can be done by identifying the local\nmanifestations of the response conditions of the strategies those\npeople are using. Identifying these response conditions is a matter of\nidentifying the correct functional description of those strategies\n(Kitcher, 1987). So how might such strategies he described? It is\nworth pointing out that this is quite difficult to do: what HBEs\nobserve in the field is sets of overt behaviors in a context of a\nvariety of ecological conditions any of which could be the response\nconditions. It may be far from obvious exactly why those behaviors are\noccurring, and which local conditions are the stimuli to which the\nbehavior is a response. Indeed, it may not even be obvious which overt\nbehaviors are manifestations of the same strategy. In the Ache case,\nwhat Kaplan and Hill observed is not a complete prey choice strategy,\nbut a variety of occasions on which individuals or groups of Ache\npeople took or did not take prey they encountered whilst out foraging,\namong many other sorts of foraging and other types of behaviors. The\nquestion is which, if any, of the overt behaviors on these occasions\nmanifested a single prey choice strategy, and how these overt\nbehaviors are related to each other and to the environmental\nconditions in which they occur. If human behavioral strategies are\nadaptations, however, then the relationships between behavioral\nresponses and local ecological conditions that resemble those of the\nhuman evolutionary past can be expected to be locally optimal,\nceteris paribus; this means that the response conditions of\nthe strategy will (allegedly) be those (along with additional\nplausible selection conditions) that made the behavior fitness\nmaximizing in the environment in which it evolved, and in any\nenvironment that is relevantly similar (Irons, 1998). This permits the\nHBEs to pick out the correct description of the strategy using an\noptimality model; identifying the causes of the Ache\u2019s behavior in\nparticular is a matter of identifying how the response conditions of\nthat strategy manifest locally in their environment. \n\nHBEs, like behavioral ecologists studying non-human animals, tend to\nuse optimality modeling to find strategy descriptions and sets of\nplausible selection conditions that make sense of observed patterns of\nbehavior as locally optimal adaptations, and the reasoning works in\nmuch the same way. However, there are a few differences, most notably\nin how models are chosen. In cases where the structure of the problem\nmight be unique to the human case and where the current environment is\nexpected to be different from the situation under which the strategy\noriginally evolved, the model HBEs choose will often be unique and at\nleast some of the proposed selection conditions identified by\nappealing to information about the fossil record. A nice example might\nbe human life history, where the human situation is relatively unique:\nfor example, compared to other primates humans have unusually long\nlives and childhoods, and long life after menopause. As a consequence,\nthe human behavioral ecologists have to appeal to the fossil record in\ndetail to determine what sorts of evolutionary transitions might have\nbeen involved (Hawkes, 2003; Kaplan et al., 2000). Where the structure\nof the adaptive problem humans face and the conditions acting on their\nbehavior is expected to mirror those in non-human animals and to be\nvery similar to those humans encountered in their evolutionary past,\nthe choice of model is often a standard one from non-human behavioral\necology; the proposed selection conditions can be based on the current\nconditions observed in foraging societies. In the Ache foraging case,\nthis is exactly what happens: the prey choice models used by Kaplan\nand Hill are those used to understand similar sorts of strategies in\nnon-human animals. This is because Kaplan and Hill expect the relevant\nconditions acting on human prey choice\u2014such as profitabilities and\nsearch times\u2014to mirror very closely those acting on non-human\nanimals.\n\nSome differences also arise in how models are tested in HBE verses\nnon-human animal behavioral ecology. The description of that strategy\npicked out by the model will usually include descriptions of potential\nbehavioral responses to conditions (or values for parameters of those\nresponses) that go beyond what has already been observed; this means\nthe model predicts that these responses should also occur if the\ndescription of the strategy is correct. For example, in Kaplan and\nHill\u2019s prey choice case, the model predicts patterns of Ache\nprey choice that the observers had not yet seen, such as which prey\nthe Ache should and should not take on encounter and under what\ncircumstances. The model, therefore, can be tested by looking for a\nsituation in which the response conditions of the strategy obtain and\nobserving whether the behavior in response to those conditions is as\nthe model suggests. This is partly why such rules are tested in\nforaging societies\u2014because many of these strategies have\nresponse conditions which reflect conditions presumed to be present in\nthe human evolutionary past, and which may obtain in foraging\nsocieties but not in industrial of agricultural societies. For\nexample, obviously in Kaplan and Hill\u2019s foraging case, few if\nany industrial or agricultural societies routinely engage in foraging\nthat is a primary source of nutrition, and hence don\u2019t present\nan opportunity for individuals to do prey choice of the right\ntype. The other reason for performing these tests in foraging\nsocieties is because the HBEs want to understand the local causes of\novert behavior in these societies in particular.\n\nHowever, just as in non-human behavioral ecology, differences between\nthe predicted and described behavioral strategies require scientists\nto build new models, or suggest additional conditions or constraints\nto add to the original models; there must be independent evidence that\nthese conditions or constraints obtain. Kaplan and Hill\u2019s\nobservations do depart from what their model predicts: the Ache engage\nin a number of prey choice decisions that are not obviously fitness\nmaximizing. In particular, men often seem to ignore many calorie rich\nfood sources from plants and sometimes smaller animals, and women do\nnot pursue larger game. The question then is how to proceed: HBEs\noften suggest changes to the model that might account for these\nfailures of prediction; often, they do give some independent evidence\nfor their suggestions. For example, one of Hawkes\u2019 proposed\nexplanations for why male hunting behavior often fails to meet prey\nchoice expectations (similar failures are found in many societies\nbesides the Ache) is that men pursue large game for reasons other than\nmerely collecting calories\u2014they are also interested in showing\noff in order to get other fitness rewards, such as additional sexual\npartners or better alliances with other men. Hawkes was able to show\nthat men\u2019s prey choice decisions were consistent with this view\n(Hawkes, 1991).\n",
