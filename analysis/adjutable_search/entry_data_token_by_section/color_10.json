    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Color Dispositionalism\n2.4 Color Dispositionalism\n\nColor-Dispositionalism is the view that colors are dispositional\nproperties: powers to appear in distinctive ways to perceivers (of the\nright kind), in the right kind of circumstances; i.e., to cause\nexperiences of an appropriate kind in those circumstances. Because\nthey involve responses on the part of color-perceivers, such theories\nare often called \u201csubjectivist\u201d.\n\nThis theory takes different forms. One form it takes is that\nassociated with people in the scientific tradition, e.g., Descartes,\nBoyle, Newton and Locke. This is the view that colors are secondary\nqualities. However, as we saw earlier, in\n section 1.2,\n this form of the dispositionalist view was part of a complex package,\nrelated to the emerging scientific world-view. For our current\npurposes, there are two crucial components to this package. The first\nis the idea that we should distinguish between two notions of color:\ncolor as a property of physical bodies, and color as it is in\nsensation (or, as it is sometimes described,\n\u201ccolor-as-we-experience-it\u201d). The second is that the\nsecondary quality view is not thought of as capturing the\ncommon-sense, or \u201cvulgar\u201d, way of thinking of color.\nRather, it is thought of as a revision or reconstruction of the\nordinary concept. \n\nThere is a different form the dispositionalist view of colors has more\nrecently taken, and which has many philosophical defenders, e.g.,\nBennett (1971), Dummett (1979), McDowell (1985), McGinn (1983),\nPeacocke (1984), Johnston (1992), and Levin (2000). These philosophers\nreject the claim that the dispositionalist view is in conflict with\nany commonsense view of color. It is held by some that\ndispositionalism can be defended as an analytic thesis, concerning the\nmeaning of color terms; it is held, or implied, by others that\npossession of the concept of color is neutral on the precise nature of\nthe colors, a nature which consists in being dispositional. One virtue\nof this account is that, if it is correct, there is no need to agree\nthat science is in conflict with our intuitive notions of color, or\nthat it shows that ordinary color talk is mistaken, or in need of\nreconstruction. Another virtue would be that it would explain what\nseems to be an important feature of color concepts, as opposed to\nprimary quality concepts: that in order to grasp, fully, color\nconcepts, it is necessary to have color experiences. (It is\ninteresting that, as Adams (2016) points out, Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of color rejects this assumption: For Aristotle, the function\nof vision is to detect colors, perceiver-independent colors.)\n\nA prominent defender of dispositionalism is Johnston (1992), whose\naccount of the major constraints upon a theory of color we examined in\nan earlier section. He concedes that dispositionalism has difficulty\nhandling the constraint imposed by commitment to the doctrine of\nRevelation but, he thinks, giving this up is a small price to pay. He\nmaintains that, nevertheless, the theory can handle all the other\nconstraints, and in so doing has major advantage over rival accounts.\nOne of the theory\u2019s merits is that it can account for the\nPrinciple of Unity, item (3) in his list, although as we have seen,\nthis principle needs to be extended. Another merit of Johnston\u2019s\nversion of dispositionalism is that it handles what seems to be a\ndifficulty for other versions, the problem of explaining the causal\nrole of color in the perception of colors, that is to say, the problem\nof meeting constraint (2) on his list:\n\nExplanation. The fact of a surface or volume or radiant\nsource being canary yellow sometimes causally explains our visual\nexperience as of canary yellow things.\n\n\nIt has been argued that dispositionalist accounts of color cannot\nhandle this causal requirement, e.g., Jackson 1998. Johnston\u2019s\nreply to this objection is that the dispositions do not have to be\nthought of as bare dispositions. We can, instead, think of them as\n\u201cconstituted dispositions\u201d, which are thought of as\nfollows: \n\n\nA constituted disposition is a higher-order property of having some\nintrinsic properties which, oddities aside, would cause the\nmanifestation of the disposition in the circumstances of\nmanifestation. (Johnston 1992 [1997: 147]) \n\n\nThus it is part of what it is to have a constituted disposition to\nhave some property, which is the causal ground of the manifestation of\nthe disposition.\n\nThere have been two major objections to dispositionalism. These have\nbeen discussed (and rejected) by J. Levin (2000). One objection is that\nthe dispositionalist theory cannot give a satisfactory account of the\nphenomenology of visual color experiences.  Let us come back to this\nobjection. The second major problem is that it cannot dissolve what\nmany think is the central problem of dispositionalism, the problem of\ncharacterizing just what the colors of objects are supposed to be,\n\u201cwithout vacuity, circularity, regress or any other such\ndamaging vice\u201d (Levin 2000: 162). The circularity problem\nreflects the way the dispositionalist thesis is usually\nformulated:\n\n\nX is red = X has the disposition to look red to normal\nperceivers, in standard conditions. \n\n\nIf we understand the phrase \u201cto look red\u201d, on the right\nhand side, to mean \u201cto look to be red\u201d, then it would seem\nwe have troubles. As Levin puts it:\n\n\nIf an object is red iff it\u2019s disposed to look red (under\nappropriate conditions), then an object must be disposed to look red\niff it\u2019s disposed to look to be disposed to look red \u2026\nand so on, ad infinitum. (Levin 2000: 163) \n\n\nThere is a range of techniques that Dispositionalists have devised to\navoid the circularity problem. They include proposals to understand\n\u201clooks red\u201d differently from that assumed above, and\nproposals to characterize the disposition differently. In addition, it\nis sometimes argued that the circularity is benign. (For further\ndiscussion, see Levin 2000, and Byrne & Hilbert 2011.)\n\nOne particularly interesting solution to the circularity problem is\nthat provided by Peacocke 1984/1997. Peacocke defends what he calls an\n\u201cexperientialist\u2019s version\u201d of the theory, one which\nrequires the introduction of a third property, besides those of being\nred, and looking red\u2014a sensational property, that of being red*.\nAccording to this account, the property red is explained not in terms\nof looking red, but in terms of causing the perceiver to have\npresented to him, sensational properties in a visual field. (For\ndiscussion, see Boghossian and Velleman 1989/1997)\n\nThe more pressing problem, however, for Color Dispositionalism is\nwhether it can give an adequate account of the phenomenology of visual\nexperience. The phenomenological problem, as McGinn describes it, is\nthat color properties do not look much like dispositions to produce\ncolor experiences, so that an error theory of color perception comes\nto seem inescapable. Colors turn out not to look the way they are said\ndispositionally to be, \u201cwhich is to say that ordinary color\nperception is intrinsically and massively misleading\u201d (McGinn\n1996: 537). Rather than adopting a dispositionalism with that\nconsequence, McGinn falls back on a Primitivist view of color, a view\nthat resists both criticisms leveled at dispostionalism.\n\nLevin 2000 has provided a powerful reply, on behalf of the\ndispositionalist, to McGinn\u2019s argument. Her challenge is\ncomplex, highlighting the assumptions that underpin McGinn\u2019s\ncriticism (and has a detailed discussion of the relevance of the\ndoctrine of Revelation). An important question seems to remain,\nhowever. In McGinn\u2019s formulation of the phenomenological\nproblem, there are two distinct claims, each of which is crucial: (1)\nColors do not look like the sorts of dispositional properties they\nwould have to be if the dispositional thesis were correct:\n\u201cColors turn out not to look the way they are said\ndispositionally to be\u201d. (2) colors look like non-dispositional\nproperties: when we see an object as red we see it as having a simple,\nmonadic, local property of the object\u2019s surface.\n\nThe second claim is expanded as follows:\n\n\nWhen we see an object as red \u2026 [the] color is perceived as\nintrinsic to the object, in much the same way that shape and size are\nperceived as intrinsic. No relation to perceivers enters into how the\ncolor appears; the color is perceived as wholly on the object, not as\nsomehow straddling the gap between it and the perceiver. (McGinn 1996:\n541\u2013542) \n\n\nOne possibility that this claim raises is that even if it is true, as\nLevin argues, that our visual experiences are such that objects look\nto have dispositional properties of the sort the\ncolor-dispositionalist is committed to, it will also be the case\n(often at least) that the colored objects look to be manifesting that\ndisposition. McGinn\u2019s claim (2) may then apply to the\nmanifestation of the disposition. If so, the dispositionalism would\nseem to be allied to an error theory, as he suggests.\n\nByrne and Hilbert (2011) provide a detailed examination of Color\nDispositionalism, which they stress, can take different forms. They\nthink that several of these forms can escape both the circularity and\nphenomenological problems, highlighted by McGinn, in part because they\ndisagree with him on the phenomenology. They have different criticism\nof the theory: that there is no good reason for accepting the theory.\nThey argue that the best reasons for accepting it depend on a highly\nimplausible theory of perception.\n\nFinally, another difficulty with dispositionalism, as it is standardly\nexpressed, is the one that Hardin (1988/1993, 2004) has stressed. As our knowledge of color vision\nhas grown, it has become increasingly more difficult to specify normal\nobservers, and standard viewing conditions in any but an arbitrary\nway, arbitrary from the point of view of metaphysics. To be sure,\nthere are conventional reasons for picking out some observers and some\nviewing conditions as special, but we can, without too much trouble,\nimagine these changing. And with respect to normal observers, we have\nfound that in fact, as things stand, there is a wide range of\nvariation among competent color perceivers. As we shall see in the\nfollowing section, these considerations have led Cohen to modify the\nstandard dispositionalist account in favor of a \u201cmore\necumenical\u201d color relationalist theory, one that relativizes the\ndispositions to groups of perceivers, and types of viewing\nconditions.\n",
