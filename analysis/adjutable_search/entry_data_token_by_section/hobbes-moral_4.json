Further Questions About the State of Nature\n\nIn response to the natural question whether humanity ever was\ngenerally in any such state of nature, Hobbes gives three examples of\nputative states of nature. First, he notes that all sovereigns are in\nthis state with respect to one another. This claim has made Hobbes the\nrepresentative example of a \u201crealist\u201d in international\nrelations. Second, he opined that many now civilized peoples were\nformerly in that state, and some few peoples\u2014\u201cthe savage\npeople in many places of America\u201d (Leviathan, XIII),\nfor instance\u2014were still to his day in the state of nature. Third\nand most significantly, Hobbes asserts that the state of nature will\nbe easily recognized by those whose formerly peaceful states have\ncollapsed into civil war. While the state of nature\u2019s condition\nof perfectly private judgment is an abstraction, something resembling\nit too closely for comfort remains a perpetually present possibility,\nto be feared, and avoided.\n\nDo the other assumptions of Hobbes\u2019s philosophy license the\nexistence of this imagined state of isolated individuals pursuing\ntheir private judgments? Probably not, since, as feminist critics\namong others have noted, children are by Hobbes\u2019s theory assumed\nto have undertaken an obligation of obedience to their parents in\nexchange for nurturing, and so the primitive units in the state of\nnature will include families ordered by internal obligations, as well\nas individuals. The bonds of affection, sexual affinity, and\nfriendship\u2014as well as of clan membership and shared religious\nbelief\u2014may further decrease the accuracy of any purely\nindividualistic model of the state of nature. This concession need not\nimpugn Hobbes\u2019s analysis of conflict in the state of nature,\nsince it may turn out that competition, diffidence and glory-seeking\nare disastrous sources of conflicts among small groups just as much as\nthey are among individuals. Still, commentators seeking to answer the\nquestion how precisely we should understand Hobbes\u2019s state of\nnature are investigating the degree to which Hobbes imagines that to\nbe a condition of interaction among isolated individuals.\n\nAnother important open question is that of what, exactly, it is about\nhuman beings that makes it the case (supposing Hobbes is right) that\nour communal life is prone to disaster when we are left to interact\naccording only to our own individual judgments. Perhaps, while people\ndo wish to act for their own best long-term interest, they are\nshortsighted, and so indulge their current interests without properly\nconsidering the effects of their current behavior on their long-term\ninterest. This would be a type of failure of rationality.\nAlternatively, it may be that people in the state of nature are fully\nrational, but are trapped in a situation that makes it individually\nrational for each to act in a way that is sub-optimal for all, perhaps\nfinding themselves in the familiar \u2018prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma\u2019 of game theory. Or again, it may be that Hobbes\u2019s\nstate of nature would be peaceful but for the presence of persons\n(just a few, or perhaps all, to some degree) whose passions overrule\ntheir calmer judgments; who are prideful, spiteful, partial, envious,\njealous, and in other ways prone to behave in ways that lead to war.\nSuch an account would understand irrational human passions to be the\nsource of conflict. Which, if any, of these accounts adequately\nanswers to Hobbes\u2019s text is a matter of continuing debate among\nHobbes scholars. Game theorists have been particularly active in these\ndebates, experimenting with different models for the state of nature\nand the conflict it engenders.\n",
