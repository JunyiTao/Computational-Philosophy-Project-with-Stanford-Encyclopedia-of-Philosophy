This new attack is directed\nagainst the occasionalism which is assumed in Malebranche\u2019s\naccount of the wisdom of God\u2019s ways of creating. In a foreword\nto the Dissertation, Arnauld says that he had completed his\ntreatment of the first two books of the R\u00e9flexions,\nand was beginning work on the third, when he received the fourth\nedition of the\n Treatise:[30]\n\nI had finished two books examining the new system of nature and grace,\nand there remained only one further book to complete the task, when I\nreceived from Rotterdam a new edition of the Treatise,\npublished that year, 1684, with several additions. The main one was a\nthird \u00c9claircissement, with the title: The\nfrequent miracles of the Old Law do not at all indicate that God often\nacts by particular volitions. And the only reason which the\nauthor of the system gives is that the miracles were done by the\nministry of the angels, who were their occasional causes.\n\n\nArnauld interrupted his work on the R\u00e9flexions to\nwrite the Dissertation, which was published in 1685 together\nwith the first chapter of Book Three of the Reflexions, a\nchapter dealing with Malebranche\u2019s position that Jesus Christ,\nin his human nature, is the occasional cause of the distribution of\ngrace. Arnauld raises theological objections to both positions, but\nalso attacks the underlying occasionalism. The Dissertation\ntouched off a rapid series of replies and ounter-replies in 1685. The\nfirst volume of Reflexions was published later in 1685, and\nthe second and third volumes in 1686.\n\nArnauld begins his attack by citing the opening sentence of the\nDernier \u00c9claircissement, in which Malebranche says\nthat he expects his readers to agree with the principle that\n\u201cGod causes (fait) everything, and hence He\ncommunicates His power to creatures only by establishing them as\noccasional causes\u2026\u201d (OM, 5, 197). Arnauld adds that\nMalebranche\n\ndoes not understand \u2018God causes everything\u2019 as ordinary\nphilosophers do, who say that the creature does not act at all unless\nGod acts with it, which they call \u2018concurrence\u2019 \u2026\nBut what he means when he says that God causes everything is that He\ncauses everything that one imagines the creature causes, and that the\ncreature causes nothing at all.\n\n\nIt is not difficult, Arnauld says, to show that the first conjunct, so\nunderstood, is false. For \u201cit destroys the nature of intelligent\nbeings, who would not be free if they did not, as real causes, form in\nthemselves the determination of their will toward particular\ngoods\u201d. (As Arnauld points out, the italicized words are\nMalebranche\u2019s.) The second conjunct of the principle is\ndispatched in a similar way:\n\nFor intelligent beings receive from God their power to form the\ndetermination of their will toward particular goods. But it is not\nonly as occasional causes but as real causes that they form in\nthemselves that determination of their will. (OA, 5, 198)\n\n\nHaving established to his satisfaction that the principle \u201ctaken\ngenerally\u201d is false, Arnauld goes on to say that there is no\nreason to deny that God has given angels power to move bodies and that\nthey are real, not mere occasional, causes of the miraculous events\nattributed to them. Again, \u201cit is not so easy to\ndemonstrate\u201d that our soul does not have the real power to move\nthe parts of the body to which it is united.\n\nIn the exchange of publications that grew out of the\nDissertation, Arnauld objects in a similar way to\nMalebranche\u2019s use of occasionalism to explain \u201chow grace\nacts in us without wounding [liberty]\u201d (OM, 5, 8). In his\nexplanation, Malebranche distinguishes the effect of grace, which is\nfrom God and is not free, from the recipient\u2019s free response,\nwhich is from the recipient and not from God. Arnauld says that\nMalebranche would have done well to heed Aquinas\u2019s advice that\none should not distinguish \u201cbetween what is from grace and what\nis from free will, as if the same thing could not be from both\u201d\n(OA, 39, 114).\n\nBoth Malebranche and Arnauld continued to write about divine causality\nand human freedom in their later work. Arnauld\u2019s late work on\nthe topic is describe in Section 6 below. Malebranche\u2019s last\neffort on the topic was his R\u00e9flexions sur la Premotion\nPhysique, published in 1715, the year of his death.\n",
