    "main_text": "The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus || Separation Thesis\n3.2 Separation Thesis\n\n\nAt one point Spinoza calls the task of establishing the separation\nof faith from philosophy \u201cthe principal purpose of the whole\nwork\u201d (TTP 14/179). And a good deal of the biblical criticism in the\nTTP can be understood as paving the way for the separation thesis,\nsince in the earlier chapters much of what Spinoza is doing is\nundermining the claim of Scripture as a source of genuine knowledge.\nThe value of Scripture does not lie in its mysteries or its abstruse\nmetaphysical content, since to the extent that it is concerned with\nthese matters it is\u2014by Spinoza\u2019s lights\u2014utterly\nconfused. Rather, it lies in the simple moral truths that Scripture\ncontains, which encourage obedience to the state (Ch. 13). The books of\nScripture are written for an unsophisticated, uneducated audience and\nconvey information in a way that is suited to such an audience, in the\nform of fantastical accounts and parables that appeal to the\nimagination rather than the intellect. And so, Spinoza argues, although\nScripture may appear to reveal profound truths about God\u2019s nature\nand his participation in our world, its salient message is not\nmetaphysical, but moral: \u201cScripture requires nothing of men other than\nobedience, and condemns not ignorance, but disobedience\u201d\n(TTP 13/173). The ethical message of loving God and loving one\u2019s\nneighbor is the backbone of all religion (Ch. 12), the whole of divine\nlaw (TTP 14/178).\n\n\nThis ethical understanding of religion is reflected in the way that\nSpinoza re-conceives of several crucial religious concepts. For\ninstance, he claims that a text is sacred to the extent that it fosters\ndevotion to God and charity to others (e.g., TTP 12/151) and that a\nperson\u2019s piety is measured in terms of her or his commitment to\njustice, charity, and obedience. Since the aim of religion is obedience\nand good works, and the aim of philosophy is truth, religion and\nphilosophy ought not to be seen as rivals. By separating religion and\nphilosophy, faith and reason, Spinoza distances himself both from those\nwho\u2014like Maimonides and Spinoza\u2019s friend Ludwig\nMeyer\u2014contort Scripture to make it conform to reason and those\nwho claim that where Scripture\nconflicts with reason it is reason that we must renounce (TTP, Ch. 15). According to\nSpinoza, because reason and faith have separate domains, neither is\nsubservient to the other. The separation thesis has profound political\nimport, since by claiming that religion is not, like philosophy, a\nsource of knowledge, Spinoza undercuts the grounds for the theological\ndisputes that were the source of considerable unrest in the Dutch\nRepublic. The dominant message of the separation thesis is that\nScripture is not the source of metaphysical knowledge and so we ought\nnot to treat it as authoritative in these matters.\n",
