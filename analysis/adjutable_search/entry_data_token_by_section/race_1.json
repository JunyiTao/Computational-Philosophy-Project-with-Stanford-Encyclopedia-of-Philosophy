    "main_text": "Do Races Exist? Contemporary Philosophical Debates\n2. Do Races Exist? Contemporary Philosophical Debates\n\nRon Mallon (2004, 2006, 2007) provides a nice sketch of the\ncontemporary philosophical terrain regarding the status of the concept\nof race, dividing it into three valid competing schools of thought\nregarding the ontological status of race, along with the discarded\nbiological conception. Racial naturalism signifies the old,\nbiological conception of race, which depicts races as bearing\n\u201cbiobehavioral essences: underlying natural (and perhaps\ngenetic) properties that (1) are heritable, biological features, (2)\nare shared by all and only the members of a race, and (3) explain\nbehavioral, characterological, and cultural predispositions of\nindividual persons and racial groups\u201d (2006, 528\u2013529).\nWhile philosophers and scientists have reached the consensus against\nracial naturalism, philosophers nevertheless disagree on the possible\nontological status of a different conception of race. Mallon divides\nsuch disagreements into three metaphysical camps (racial\nskepticism, racial constructivism, and racial\npopulation naturalism) and two normative camps\n(eliminativism and conservationism). We have used\n\u2018constructivism\u2019 throughout for the sake of consistency\nbut it should be read as interchangeable with\n\u2018constructionism.\u2019\n\nRacial skepticism holds that because racial naturalism is\nfalse, races of any type do not exist. Racial skeptics, such as\nAnthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) contend that\nthe term race cannot refer to anything real in the world, since the\none thing in the world to which the term could uniquely\nrefer\u2014discrete, essentialist, biological races\u2014have been\nproven not to exist. Zack (2002, 87\u201388) provides an accessible\nsummary of the racial skeptic\u2019s argument against the biological\nfoundations for race, sequentially summarizing the scientific\nrejection of essences, geography, phenotypes, post-Mendelian\ntransmission genetics, and genealogies as possible foundations for\nraces. Aristotelian essences, thought to ground the common\ncharacteristics of distinct species, were correctly rejected by early\nmodern philosophers. If essences cannot even ground differences among\nspecies, then they clearly cannot ground the differences among races,\nwhich even nineteenth century racial science still understood as\nmembers of the same species. Whereas folk theories rely on\ngeography to divide humanity into African, European, Asian,\nand Amerindian races, contemporary population genetics reveal the\nvacuity of this foundation for two reasons. First, geographically\nbased environmental stimuli lead to continuous physical adaptations in\nskin, hair and bone rather than the discrete differences associated\nwith race; and second, although mitochondrial DNA mutations provide\nevidence of the geographical origins of populations, these mutations\ndo not correlate with the physical traits associated with racial\ngroups. Similarly, phenotypes cannot ground folk theories of\nrace: for instance, differences in skin tone are gradual, not\ndiscrete; and blood-type variations occur independently of the more\nvisible phenotypes associated with race, such as skin color and hair\ntexture. Race cannot be founded upon transmission genetics,\nsince the genes transmitted from one generation to the next lead to\nvery specific physical traits, not general racial characteristics\nshared by all members of a putatively racial group. And finally,\ngenealogy cannot ground race, since clades (populations\ndescended from a common ancestor) may have common genetic\ncharacteristics, but these need not correlate with the visible traits\nassociated with races. Zack concludes: \u201cEssences, geography,\nphenotypes, genotypes, and genealogy are the only known candidates for\nphysical scientific bases of race. Each fails. Therefore, there is no\nphysical scientific basis for the social racial taxonomy\u201d (Zack\n2002, 88).\n\nRacial skeptics like Appiah and Zack adopt normative racial\neliminativism, which recommends discarding the concept of\nrace entirely, according to the following argument. Because of its\nhistorical genealogy, the term race can only refer to one or more\ndiscrete groups of people who alone share biologically significant\ngenetic features. Such a monopoly on certain genetic features could\nonly emerge within a group that practices such a high level of\ninbreeding that it is effectively genetically isolated. Such genetic\nisolation might refer to the Amish in America (Appiah 1996, 73) or to\nIrish Protestants (Zack 2002, 69), but they clearly cannot refer to\nthose groupings of people presently subsumed under American racial\ncensus categories. Because the concept \u201crace\u201d can only\napply to groups not typically deemed races (Amish, Irish Protestants),\nand because this concept cannot apply to groups typically deemed races\n(African Americans, Whites, Asians, Native Americans), a mismatch\noccurs between the concept and its typical referent. Thus, the concept\nof race must be eliminated due to its logical incoherence (Mallon\n2006, 526, 533).\n\nAppiah has since modified his skepticism in such a way that softens\nthe eliminitivist element of his position. Appiah has come to argue\nfor racial nominalism by admitting the importance of\n\u201chuman folk races,\u201d namely, that they are forms of social\nidentity that do in fact exist (2006, 367). The way in which they are\nsocial identities, however, is a problem because we treat them as if\nthere were some biological underpinning to them (2006, 367). The folk\ntheory of race, then, is false because it is based on mistaken\nbeliefs, yet it is nonetheless true that we continue to categorize\npeople along its lines. Appiah\u2019s nominalist view of race aims to\nreveal how these social identities work by analyzing the labels we use\nfor them. According to Appiah there are three ways that we categorize\nusing folk racial labels: ascription, identification, and treatment,\nand it takes all three for a given label to be a functioning social\nidentity (2006, 368\u2013370). As a result, we come to live as these\nidentities and look to them as a central resource for constructing our\nlives. Furthermore, norms of identification and authenticity arise\naround them (2006, 372). Since there is no biological story that can\nbe told to ground these labels then race is not real (2006, 372). For\na critique of Appiah\u2019s modified view that focuses on Appiah\n(1996) see Ronald R. Sundstrom (2002).\n\nRacial constructivism refers to the argument that, even if\nbiological race is false, races have come into existence and continue\nto exist through \u201chuman culture and human decisions\u201d\n(Mallon 2007, 94). Race constructivists accept the skeptics\u2019\ndismissal of biological race but argue that the term still\nmeaningfully refers to the widespread grouping of individuals into\ncertain categories by society, indeed often by the very members of\nsuch racial ascriptions. Normatively, race constructivists argue that\nsince society labels people according to racial categories, and since\nsuch labeling often leads to race-based differences in resources,\nopportunities, and well-being, the concept of race must be conserved,\nin order to facilitate race-based social movements or policies, such\nas affirmative action, that compensate for socially constructed but\nsocially relevant racial differences. While sharing this normative\ncommitment to race conservationism, racial constructivists\ncan be subdivided into three groups with slightly different accounts\nof the ontology of race. As we will see below, however, Sally\nHaslanger\u2019s eliminitivist constructivism illustrates how these\ncommitments can come apart.\n\nThin constructivism depicts race as a grouping of humans\naccording to ancestry and genetically insignificant,\n\u201csuperficial properties that are prototypically linked with\nrace,\u201d such as skin tone, hair color and hair texture (Mallon\n2006, 534). In this way, thin constructivists such as Robert\nGooding-Williams (1998), Lucius Outlaw (1990, 1996) and Charles Mills\n(1998) rely on the widespread folk theory of race while rejecting its\nscientific foundation upon racial naturalism. Interactive kind\nconstructivism goes further, in arguing that being ascribed to a\ncertain racial category causes the individuals so labeled to have\ncertain common experiences (Mallon 2006, 535; Piper 1992). For\ninstance, if society ascribes you as black, you are likely to\nexperience difficulty hailing cabs in New York or are more likely to\nbe apprehended without cause by the police (James 2004, 17). Finally,\ninstitutional constructivism emphasizes race as a social\ninstitution, whose character is specific to the society in which it is\nembedded and thus cannot be applied across cultures or historical\nepochs (Mallon 2006, 536). Michael Root (2000, 632) notes that a\nperson ascribed as Black in the United States would likely not be\nconsidered Black in Brazil, since each country has very different\nsocial institutions regarding the division of humanity into distinct\nraces. Similarly, Paul Taylor (2000) responds to Appiah\u2019s racial\nskepticism by holding that races, even if biologically unreal, remain\nreal social objects (Mallon 2006, 536\u2013537). Indeed, in a later\nwork Taylor (2004) argues that the term \u201crace\u201d has a\nperfectly clear referent, that being those people socially ascribed to\ncertain racial categories within the United States, regardless of the\nwidespread social rejection of biological racial naturalism.\n\nSally Haslanger\u2019s constructivism (2000, 2010, 2019) is not,\nhowever, conservationist. She understands races as racialized groups,\nwhose membership requires three criteria. One, members are those who\nare \u201cobserved or imagined\u201d to have certain bodily features\nthat are evidence of certain ancestry from certain geographical\nlocations; two, \u201chaving (or being imagined to have)\u201d those\nfeatures marks members as occupying either a subordinate or privileged\nsocial position, thereby justifying that position; and three, the\nsatisfaction of the first two criteria plays a role in members\u2019\nsystemic subordination or privilege (2019, 25\u201326). Racial\nidentity in such contexts need not focus exclusively on subordination\nor privilege, as \u201cmany forms of racial identity are important,\nvaluable, and in some cases even inevitable responses to racial\nhierarchy\u201d (2019, 29\u201330). She worries, however, that even\nthough we should embrace \u201ccultural groups marked by ancestry and\nappearance\u201d in the short term to fight for justice, she worries\nabout embracing them for the long term (2019, 30).\n\nConstructivism also cleaves along political and cultural dimensions, a\ndistinction owed to Chike Jeffers (Jeffers, 2013, 2019).\nHaslanger\u2019s view is paradigmatic of political constructivism by\nunderstanding the meaning of race as determined by hierarchical\nrelations of power by definition: \u201crace is made real\nwholly or most importantly by hierarchical relations of power\u201d\n(Jeffers 2019, 48). Jeffers\u2019 cultural constructivism corrects\nfor political constructivism\u2019s inability to account for race\nexisting after racism, including the idea of racial equality (2013,\n421; 2019, 71). Cultural constructivism rejects \u201cthe idea that\ncultural difference is less important than differences in power\nrelations for understanding racial phenomena in the present\u201d\n(2019, 65). At the extreme, political constructivism argues for, one,\ndifferential power relations bring racial difference into existence;\ntwo, differential power relations are fundamental for understanding\nthe present reality of race; and three, differential power relations\nare essential to race, so race will cease to exist in an egalitarian\nsociety where appearance and ancestry do not correlate to certain\nhierarchical positions (2019, 56\u201357). Jeffers concedes\nrace\u2019s political origin while rejecting the two other ways that\npower relations define race (2013, 419; 2019, 57\u201358). The\ncultural significance of race can be seen in three ways. First, even\nthe emergence of racial categories counts as a cultural shift, insofar\nas new social contexts are created in which those viewed as being of\ndifferent races are also viewed as having different cultures. Second,\nthere are \u201cnovel forms of cultural difference\u201d that emerge\nin the wake of racial difference. And third, racial groups are shaped\nculturally by happenings prior to racial formation (2019,\n62\u201363). Jeffers thus writes of Blackness, \u201cWhat it means\nto be a Black person, for many of us, including myself, can never be\nexhausted through reference to problems of stigmatization,\ndiscrimination, marginalization, and disadvantage, as real and as\nlarge-looming as these factors are in the racial landscape as we know\nit. There is also joy in blackness, a joy shaped by culturally\ndistinctive situations\u201d (2013, 422).\n\nThere are also views that challenge the broad strokes of\nconstructivism while avoiding racial skepticism: Lionel K.\nMcPherson\u2019s deflationary pluralism (2015), Joshua\nGlasgow\u2019s basic racial realism (2015, with Jonathan M. Woodward,\n2019), and Michael O. Hardimon\u2019s deflationary realism (2003,\n2014, 2017). McPherson argues that \u201crace\u201d should be\nreplaced with his concept of socioancestry, since\n\u201c\u2018race\u2019 talk overall is too ambiguous and contested\nto be salvaged in the search for a dominant understanding\u201d\n(2015, 676). He aims to sidestep Appiah\u2019s eliminativism by\nclaiming that deflationary pluralism \u201cdoes not maintain that\n\u2018race\u2019 talk is necessarily an error and does not take a\nhard line about whether races exist\u201d (2015, 675). Socioancestry\nretains the possibility of \u201ccolor-conscious social\nidentity\u201d without the burdens of assumptions or confusions about\nrace and racial nature (2015, 686). This is because it is\n\u201cvisible continental ancestry,\u201d rather than race, which is\nthe root of color-consciousness (2015, 690). Socioancestry, then,\nfocuses on visible continental ancestry alone to explain social group\nformation. Accordingly, socioancestral identities develop \u201cwhen\npersons accept (or are ascribed) a social identity because they share\na component of continental ancestry that distinctively shapes\ncolor-conscious social reality\u201d (2015, 690).\n\nGlasgow\u2019s basic racial realism aims to capture our operative\nmeaning of race: \u201cthe meaning that governs our use of the term,\neven when we are unaware of it\u201d (2019, 115). Glasgow defines his\nposition in the following way: \u201cRaces, by definition, are\nrelatively large groups of people who are distinguished from other\ngroups of people by having certain visible biological traits (such as\nskin color) to a disproportionate extent.\u201d The position is\ntherefore anti-realist, since it claims that races are neither\nbiologically nor socially real (2019, 117). Glasgow\u2019s position\nis grounded in judgments about our commitments, believing that we are\nmore willing to give up on the biological basis for race than we are\nto give up on the idea that there are certain \u201ccore features and\nidentities\u201d connected to the idea of race\u201d (2019, 127). In\nother words, disbelieving in the biological reality of race\ndoesn\u2019t lead to eliminativism. Glasgow holds, however, that it\nalso doesn\u2019t lead to social constructivism. Race is not socially\nmade because, \u201cno matter which social facts we attend to, we can\nalways imagine them disappearing while race stays. And if race is\nconceptually able to persist across all social practices, then by\ndefinition it is not a social phenomenon\u201d (2019, 133). This\nintuition is based in his focus on our ordinary usage of the term\n\u201crace,\u201d which is fully captured by visible traits.\n\nHardimon\u2019s deflationary realism argues that we need four\ninterrelated race concepts to coherently answer the question of what\nrace is to human beings: the racialist concept of race, the minimalist\nconcept of race, the populationist concept of race, and the concept of\nsocialrace (2017, 2\u20133, 7). The racialist concept of race is the\nview that there are fixed patterns of race-based moral, intellectual,\nand cultural characteristics that are heritable, based in an\nunderlying biological essence, correlate to physical characteristics,\nand form a distinct racial hierarchy (2017, 15\u201316). Minimalist\nrace \u201csays that people differ in shape and color in ways that\ncorrespond to differences in their geographical ancestry. Essentially\nthat is all it says\u201d (2017, 6; see also 2003). It aims to\ncapture in \u201ca nonmalefic way\u201d what the racialist concept\nof race says that it captures. In other words, it admits of the\nnonsocial and biological reality of race but in a value-neutral way\n(2017, 7). Populationist race aims to do the same thing in a more\nrobust and specific way by giving a genetic underpinning to the\nminimalist conception based on a \u201cgeographically separated and\nreproductively isolated founding population\u201d (2017, 99). This\nconcept is distinguished from cladistic race because it does not\nrequire monophyly (2017, 110). Finally, socialrace captures race in\nterms of its social relations and practices. It refers to \u201cthe\nsocial groups in racist societies that appear to be racialist races as\nsocial groups that falsely appear to be biological groups\u201d\n(2017, 10; see also 2014). Hardimon argues that it is only through\nusing all four concepts, with the rejection of the first being the\nbasis for the construction of the latter three, that we can actually\nunderstand our concept of race.\n\nThe third school of thought regarding the ontology of race is\nracial population naturalism. This camp suggests that,\nalthough racial naturalism falsely attributed cultural, mental, and\nphysical characters to discrete racial groups, it is possible that\ngenetically significant biological groupings could exist that would\nmerit the term races. Importantly, these biological racial groupings\nwould not be essentialist or discrete: there is no set of genetic or\nother biological traits that all and only all members of a racial\ngroup share that would then provide a natural biological boundary\nbetween racial groups. Thus, these thinkers confirm the strong\nscientific consensus that discrete, essentialist races do not exist.\nHowever, the criteria of discreteness and essentialism would also\ninvalidate distinctions between non-human species, such as lions and\ntigers. As Philip Kitcher puts it, \u201cthere is no\u2026genetic\nfeature\u2026that separates one species of mosquito or mushroom from\nanother\u201d (Kitcher 2007, 294\u2013296; Cf. Mallon 2007,\n146\u2013168). Rather, biological species are differentiated by\nreproductive isolation, which is relative, not absolute (since hybrids\nsometimes appear in nature); which may have non-genetic causes (e.g.,\ngeographic separation and incompatible reproduction periods or\nrituals); which may generate statistically significant if not uniform\ngenetic differences; and which may express distinct phenotypes. In\neffect, if the failure to satisfy the condition of discreteness and\nessentialism requires jettisoning the concept of race, then it also\nrequires jettisoning the concept of biological species. But because\nthe biological species concept remains epistemologically useful, some\nbiologists and philosophers use it to defend a racial ontology that is\n\u201cbiologically informed but non-essentialist,\u201d one that is\nvague, non-discrete, and related to genetics, genealogy, geography,\nand phenotype (Sesardic 2010, 146).\n\nThere are three versions of racial population naturalism: cladistic\nrace; socially isolated race; and genetically clustered race.\nCladistic races are \u201cancestor-descendant sequences of\nbreeding populations that share a common origin\u201d (Andreasen\n2004, 425). They emerged during human evolution, as different groups\nof humans became geographically isolated from each other, and may be\ndying out, if they have not already, due to more recent human\nreproductive intermingling (Andreasen 1998, 214\u2013216; Cf.\nAndreasen 2000, S653\u2013S666). Socially isolated race\nrefers to the fact that legal sanctions against miscegenation might\nhave created a genetically isolated African American race in the USA\n(Kitcher 1999). Finally, defenders of genetically clustered\nrace argue that although only 7% of the differences between any\ntwo individuals regarding any one specific gene can be attributed to\ntheir membership in one of the commonly recognized racial categories,\nthe aggregation of several genes is statistically related to a small\nnumber of racial categories associated with major geographic regions\nand phenotypes (Sesardic 2010; Kitcher 2007, 304).\n\nThe question is whether these new biological ontologies of race avoid\nthe conceptual mismatches that ground eliminativism. The short answer\nis that they can, but only through human intervention. Socially\nisolated race faces no mismatch when applied to African Americans,\ndefined as the descendants of African slaves brought to the United\nStates. However, this racial category would not encompass Black\nAfricans. Moreover, because African American race originated in\nlegally enforced sexual segregation, it is \u201cboth biologically\nreal and socially constructed\u201d (Kitcher 2007, 298). Genetic\nclustering would seem to provide an objective, biological foundation\nfor a broader racial taxonomy, but differences in clustered genes are\ncontinuous, not discrete, and thus scientists must decide where to\ndraw the line between one genetically clustered race and another. If\nthey program their computers to distinguish four genetic clusters,\nthen European, Asian, Amerindian, and African groups will emerge; if\nonly two clusters are sought, then only the African and Amerindian\n\u201craces\u201d remain (Kitcher 2007, 304). Thus, genetic\nclustering avoids racial mismatch only through the decisions of the\nscientist analyzing the data. The same problem also confronts\ncladistic race, since the number of races will vary from nine, at the\nmost recent period of evolutionary reproductive isolation, to just\none, if we go back to the very beginning, since all humans were\noriginally Africans. But in addition, cladistic race faces a stronger\nmismatch by \u201ccross-classifying\u201d groups that we typically\nthink of as part of the same race, for example by linking northeast\nAsians more closely with Europeans than with more phenotypically\nsimilar southeast Asians. Robin Andreasen defends the cladistic race\nconcept by correctly arguing that folk theories of race have\nthemselves generated counter-intuitive cross-classifications,\nparticularly with respect to the Census\u2019 Asian category, which\npreviously excluded Asian Indians and now excludes native Hawaiians\nand Pacific Islanders. (Andreasen 2005, 100\u2013101; Andreasen 2004,\n430\u2013431; Cf. Glasgow 2003, 456\u2013474; Glasgow 2009,\n91\u2013108). But this hardly saves her argument, since the US\nCensus\u2019s history of shifting racial categories and past use of\nethnic and religious terms (e.g., Filipino, Hindu, and Korean) to\nsignify races is typically taken as evidence of the social,\nrather than biological, foundations of race (Espiritu 1992, Chapter\n5).\n\nQuayshawn Spencer (2012, 2014, 2019) is resistant to arguments that\ncladistic subspecies are a viable biological candidate for race (2012,\n203). Instead, he defends a version of biological racial realism that\nunderstands \u201cbiologically real\u201d as capturing \u201call of\nthe entities that are used in empirically successful\nbiology\u2026and that adequately rules out all of the entities that\nare not\u201d (2019, 77; see also 95). Spencer argues that such an\nentity exists and can be found in the US government\u2019s Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) and its racial classifications. The basis\nfor this claim is that population genetics has identified five\ndistinctive \u201chuman continental populations\u201d that satisfy\nthe criteria for biological reality (2019, 98; 95). The OMB\nclassifications map onto these continental populations. The importance\nof the OMB is that its ubiquity in our lives means that one of the\nprimary ways that we talk about race is through its categories.\nSpencer highlights this centrality when he points out the ways that\nAmericans self-report their races correspond to the parameters of the\nOMB classifications (2019, 83\u201385). Spencer is pluralist about\nrace talk, however, meaning that OMB race is just one dominant meaning\nof race, while there is no single dominant meaning among users of the\nterm (2019, 213).\n\nIn each case, racial population naturalism encounters problems in\ntrying to demarcate discrete boundaries between different biological\npopulations. If discreteness is indispensable to a human racial\ntaxonomy, then mismatches can only be avoided, if at all, through\nhuman intervention. But as noted above, biological species are also\nnot genetically discrete, and thus boundaries between non-human\nspecies must also be imposed through human intervention. And just as\nthe demarcation of non-human species is justified through its\nscientific usefulness, so too are human racial categories justified.\nFor instance, Andreason contends that a cladistic race concept that\ndivides northeastern from southeastern Asians is scientifically useful\nfor evolutionary research, even if it conflicts with the folk concept\nof a unified Asian race. In turn, the concepts of genetically\nclustered and socially isolated race may remain useful for detecting\nand treating some health problems. Ian Hacking provides a careful\nargument in favor of the provisional use of American racial categories\nin medicine. Noting that racial categories do not reflect\nessentialist, uniform differences, he reiterates the finding that\nthere are statistically significant genetic differences among\ndifferent racial groups. As a result, an African American is more\nlikely to find a bone marrow match from a pool of African American\ndonors than from a pool of white donors. Thus, he defends the practice\nof soliciting African American bone marrow donors, even though this\nmay provide fodder to racist groups who defend an essentialist and\nhierarchical conception of biological race (Hacking 2005,\n102\u2013116; Cf. Kitcher 2007, 312\u2013316). Conversely, Dorothy\nRoberts emphasizes the dangers of using racial categories within\nmedicine, suggesting that it not only validates egregious ideas of\nbiological racial hierarchy but also contributes to conservative\njustifications for limiting race-based affirmative action and even\nsocial welfare funding, which supposedly would be wasted on\ngenetically inferior minority populations. In effect, race-based\nmedicine raises the specter of a new political synthesis of colorblind\nconservatism with biological racialism (Roberts 2008, 537\u2013545).\nHowever, Roberts\u2019 critique fails to engage the literature on the\nstatistical significance of racial categories for genetic differences.\nMoreover, she herself acknowledges that many versions of colorblind\nconservatism do not rely at all on biological justifications.\n",
