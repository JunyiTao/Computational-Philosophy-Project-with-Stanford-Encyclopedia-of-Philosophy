    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Sextus Empiricus\n4.4 Sextus Empiricus\n\nSextus\u2019 (ca. 160\u2013210 CE) epithet, Empiricus, indicates\nthat he belonged to the empiricists, a medical school (cf.\nSvavarson 2014 for a brief conspectus of Sextus\u2019 philosophy).\nThe empiricist medical school argued against rationalistic tendencies\nin medicine (Frede 1990; Allen 2010). Rationalism in medicine aims to\ngive causal explanations as a basis for therapies. Empiricism, on the\ncontrary, confines itself to observation and memory. Somewhat\nconfusingly (considering his name), Sextus discusses differences\nbetween Pyrrhonism and empiricism, and says that skepticism is closer\nto medical methodism than to empiricism (Allen 2010). On the whole, it\nmay be safest to think of Sextus as rejecting medical rationalism as\nwell as other trends within medicine that by Sextus\u2019 lights are\ndogmatic. Methodism follows appearances, and derives from them what\nseems beneficial. No explanations are attempted, no underlying\nsubstances postulated, and no regularities assumed\u2014these are\nsome of the rationalistic methods that both methodism and empiricism\nargue against. Methodism also makes no statements to the effect that\nsuch explanations cannot be given, or that underlying substances and\nregularities do not exist, as Sextus says empiricism does (SE\nPH 1.236\u2013241). Beyond the fact that Sextus was a\ndoctor and wrote on medicine (M 7.202, M 1.61), his philosophical\nthinking seems shaped by engagement with medical writers. Scholars\nhave long been interested in the relationship between medicine and\nskeptical arguments that pertain to be therapeutic (Voelke 1990). More\nrecently, scholars explore ways in which medical writings, in\nparticular by Galen, inform Sextus\u2019 thinking, even on specific\nissues such as how to conceive of and solve sophisms (Schmitt,\nforthcoming). It has also been argued that the skeptics\u2019\napplication of the modes should be interpreted in light of the\nmethodological commitments of non-rationalist medicine (Sienkiewicz\n2019, 2021).\n\nSextus\u2019 philosophical writings are traditionally divided into\ntwo groups. The Outlines of Pyrrhonism [PH] consists\nof three books. PH 1 is the only general account of\nPyrrhonism that survives. PH 2 and 3 discuss questions of\nlogic, physics, and ethics. The other writings are summarily referred\nto, traditionally, as Against the Mathematicians\n[M]. In fact, they oppose not just mathematical, but also\nother theorists: the title really means Against the\nTheoreticians, or Against the Learned (Bett 2012). In a\nsense, only M 1\u20136 should go by that title. It is a\ncomplete work, and M 7 does not seem to be its continuation\n(Bett 2012, \u201cIntroduction\u201d). M 1\u20136 discuss\ngrammar, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astrology, and music theory.\nThey argue against theoretical \u2018learning\u2019 in these fields.\nM 7\u201311 discuss core questions of the three\nphilosophical disciplines, logic, physics, and ethics, and could\nplausibly be referred to as Against the Logicians (M\n7\u20138), Against the Physicists (M 9\u201310),\nand Against the Ethicists (M 11). Scholars disagree\non whether M is earlier (Bett 1997) or later than PH\n(Janacek 1948 and 1972). Scholars also disagree on whether we can\nevaluate different strands of skepticism within Sextus as more or less\nsophisticated. Those who consider PH as later often do so\nbecause they think it shows greater philosophical sophistication,\neither by avoiding claims that a certain matter cannot be known\n(sometimes described as negative dogmatism), as found in M\n1\u20136 and M 11, or by streamlining discussions from\nM 7\u201310 (Bett 1997; Brunschwig 1980).\n\nThese questions are complicated further by Sextus\u2019 attempt to\nincorporate diverse material, such as different sets of Modes, into\nhis skepticism. According to recent interpretations, the\ndifferent sets of modes are part of an integrated philosophical\napproach (Powers 2010). Morison (2018) argues that the Ten Modes and\nFive Modes both serve the same purpose: to produce equal and opposing\narguments to arguments in support of philosophical or scientific\nviews. Arguably, two kinds of consistency are at work in Sextus\u2019\nwritings. On the one hand, Sextus aims at the consistency of one\nphilosophical outlook. On the other hand, he aims at the consistency\nof having a response to every objection. These two aims overlap\ngreatly, but they can also come apart. A given argument might refute a\nparticular critic. This argument may go back to various earlier\nversions of Pyrrhonism. Similarly, the critical objection that is\nrefuted may be traced to dogmatic theories formulated over the course\nof several centuries. As a result, a given argument in Sextus may be\neffective against a given objection he has in mind. It may thus\npreserve consistency in the sense of leaving the skeptic unharmed by\ndogmatic criticism. But at the same time, this argument may have\nimplications that are in tension with the way in which Sextus explains\nskepticism in other passages. Such tensions are particularly important\nwith respect to the way in which Sextus uses core concepts. For\nexample, it is not clear that Sextus uses the notion of appearances\n(phainomena) in a consistent fashion (PH\n1.8\u20139; 1.15; 1.22; for the view that Sextus employs the notion\nconsistently throughout, see Barney 1992). At times, he draws on the\ncontrast between appearances and thoughts (noumena). But for\nthe most part, the term refers to all cases where something seems\nso-and-so to the skeptic, either perceptually or in thought. In some\ncontexts, Sextus draws on the idea that appearances are impressions,\ninvoking the dogmatic assumption that impressions are passive. In\nother contexts, he does not envisage appearances as entirely passively\nexperienced (Vogt 2012b).\n\nIt is thus no surprise that the interpretation of Sextus\u2019\nPyrrhonism is quite controversial. This applies in particular to the\nquestion of whether the skeptic has any beliefs, or beliefs of any\nkind. In the past 40 years, scholars have paid attention to this\nquestion more than to any other interpretive issue. Insofar as the\ntexts may contain different strands of Pyrrhonian argument, exegesis\nis to some extent shaped by the philosophical interests we bring to\nthe texts. Two ideas are particularly prominent here. First, some\nscholars find in Sextus an account of action that challenges standard\nancient and modern theories of agency. These theories might portray\nordinary agents as all-too-rational, as if every action involved an\nactively formed belief that such-and-such is good. Scholars explore\nhow far we can draw on Sextus, asking whether a life guided by\nappearances (as Sextus says the skeptic\u2019s life is) might after\nall be rather ordinary (Frede 1979 [1997]). Second, one might on the\nother hand embrace those aspects of Sextus\u2019 texts that make\nPyrrhonism look radically different from ordinary life. From this\nperspective, Sextus\u2019 writings invite reflection on the question\nof whether it would be possible to live without belief (Burnyeat 1980\n[1997]; Barnes 1982 [1997]; Burnyeat 1984 [1997]).\n\nPH 1, which figures most prominently in scholarly\ndiscussions, is a tour de force. Sextus gives a general\naccount of what skepticism is, including skeptical investigation,\nsuspension of judgment, the skeptic\u2019s end, action, and language;\nhe gives lists and illustrations of various sets of Modes; he explains\nthe so-called skeptical formulae (ph\u00f4nai), such as\n\u201cI determine nothing,\u201d \u201cnon-assertion,\u201d\n\u201cmaybe,\u201d and so on; and he compares skepticism to\nrelevantly similar philosophies.\n\nSextus emphasizes that the skeptic is an investigator. Others either\narrive at theories (dogmatism) or at claims about inapprehensibility\n(negative dogmatism\u2014that the matter investigated is beyond\none\u2019s capacity to decide, and so is unknowable). But the skeptic\ncontinues to investigate (PH 1.1\u20134). Investigation is\ndescribed as setting appearances and thoughts into opposition\n(PH 1.8) (Morison 2011 offers a reconstruction of skepticism\nthat takes its starting\u2013point from this description), and as the\napplication of the various sets of Modes (PH 1.36\u2013186).\nSkepticism does not have teachings, but it is an approach in\nphilosophy (Smith 2022). Many of the thoughts the skeptics arrive at\nare expressed in the skeptical formulae (PH 1.13\u201315;\n187\u2013209). The starting\u2013point (arch\u00ea) of\nskepticism is divergency\u2014an\u00f4malia. The\nproto-skeptics are disturbed by the discrepancies they encounter, and\nbegin to investigate (PH 1.12). They hope to gain quietude by settling\nwhat is true and what is false. But then they have a surprising\nexperience. Encountering disagreement where several views appear to be\nof equal weight (isostheneia), they find themselves unable to\ndecide things, give up, and experience tranquility (ataraxia)\n(Striker 1990 [1996]; Nussbaum 1994). The skeptic\u2019s end\n(telos) is tranquility in matters of belief (kata\ndoxan) and moderate affection (metriopatheia) in matters\nthat are forced upon us (PH 1.25\u201329). That is, skeptics\ncan free themselves from those kinds of turmoil that come with holding\nbeliefs. They cannot free themselves from freezing, thirst, or pain.\nBut they suffer less than others, for they do not add the belief\n(prosdoxazein) that, for example, pain is bad. The skeptic\nmust explain how, without belief (adoxast\u00f4s), they can\nbe active. Sextus says that skeptics follow appearances, and that is,\nthat they adhere to the fourfold ways of life (PH\n1.21\u201324). Nature supplies them with perception and thought;\nnecessary affections compel them (for example, thirst guides them to\ndrink); they go along with traditions and customs; and they can do\ntechnical things by having been instructed in skills. The notion of\nappearances is also central to Sextus\u2019 account of how the\nskeptic can speak. Without making assertions, a skeptic reports\n(apangellein) like a chronicler (historik\u00f4s)\nwhat appears to them now (PH 1.4).\n\nI shall discuss the following aspects of Sextus\u2019 skepticism: (i)\ninvestigation and tranquility, (ii) concepts and inference rules,\n(iii) belief, (iv) the formulae, (v) appearances, (vi) language, (vii)\naction, and (viii) the so-called special arguments (that is, arguments\nthat do not explain the nature of Pyrrhonism, but engage with specific\ndogmatic theories in logic, physics, and ethics).\n\n(i) Investigation and tranquility. Investigation must aim at discovery\nof the truth, otherwise it is not genuine investigation. However, a\nskeptic seems to mechanically apply the skeptical Modes, in order to\ngenerate suspension of judgment and tranquility. Scholars disagree on\nwhether the skeptics genuinely aim at the truth (Palmer 2000;\nStriker 2001; Perin 2006; Veres 2020b), while they (also) aim at\ntranquility. Note that this objection, unlike the other problems\ncentral to contemporary engagement with ancient skepticism, was not\nraised in antiquity. If ancient skepticism is approached in the\ncontext of the larger study of ancient philosophy, we might first of\nall note that the skeptics in a sense agree with Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics. All these philosophers defend, in\nso many formulations, a life of reason, of contemplation, of wisdom,\nor of inquiry as the best or at least a very good human life (on\naffinities between the skeptics\u2019 commitment to inquiry and\nAristotle, cf. Olfert 2015). The objection that skeptical inquiry\nseems insincere, then, may not have come up in antiquity in quite the\nway in which it is discussed today because a commitment to inquiry\nwould be common ground among most philosophers. Further, we might\nobserve that aiming at the truth includes two aims: to accept truths,\nand to avoid falsehoods. The Modes are tailored to keep us from\nassenting to something that could be false. Insofar as the\nskeptic\u2019s effort to avoid falsehoods expresses a valuation for\nthe truth, the skeptic might be a genuine investigator (Vogt 2012a,\nch. 5; Olfert 2014).\n\nA related objection calls into question the actual practice of\nskeptical inquiry. Does Sextus rely on the assumption that, in any\ngiven case of putting several arguments into opposition, these\narguments are equally persuasive for the skeptic? This seems\nunrealistic: at least in some cases, skeptical inquirers are bound to\nbe more strongly attracted to one view than to another. How then do\nthey arrive at suspension of judgment? One skeptical strategy is to\nremind oneself that additional arguments will be formulated in the\nfuture (PH 1.33\u201334, 89, 96\u201397; 2.38\u201341;\n3.233\u201334). Another strategy is to consider that different\narguments are persuasive to different people (Svararsson 2014).\nRelatedly, skeptics may find themselves in a position comparable to a\nstudent who takes a seminar on freedom and determinism: it is possible\nto be more attracted to one view rather than another, and at the same\ntime be aware that as far as the arguments are concerned, there is\nunresolved disagreement among several views, to the effect that\nneither of the views seems compelling in ways that warrant assent (cf.\nVogt 2012a, ch. 5, on how the skeptical expression \u201cas far as\nthe argument is concerned\u201d bears on this question; for general\ndiscussion of this expression, cf. Brunschwig 1990).\n\n(ii) Concepts and rules of inference. If skeptics do not assent, then\nhow can they understand the terms philosophers use (M\n8.337\u2013332a)? Even more radically, how can they even think\n(PH 2.1\u201312)? This objection, which Sextus says is\ncontinually raised against the skeptics, proceeds on the assumption\nthat possession of concepts involves the acceptance of assumptions.\nFor example, in order to examine a given theory of proof, the skeptic\nmust have a notion of what proofs are. This involves assumptions: for\nexample, the assumption that a proof contains premises and a\nconclusion. Sextus\u2019 response to this objection invokes the\nEpicurean and Stoic theories of preconceptions. Human beings are not\nborn with reason (Frede 1994, 1996). The acquisition of reason is a\nnature-guided process of concept acquisition. At a given age, children\nhave completed this process. They have become rational, which means\nthat they can perceive and think in a conceptual way. Only now, they\nhave rational impressions to which they can assent. The acquisition of\npreconceptions did not involve assent, simply because the child was\nnot yet rational (Brittain 2005).\n\nSextus invokes dogmatic ideas about the acquisition of reason (or: the\nabilities of conceptual thought) in his response to the Apraxia Charge\n(PH 1.23\u20134). Skeptics are, first of all, active because\nnature has equipped them with perception and thought (Vogt 1998,\n2010). More generally, the skeptics\u2019 ability to think and\ninvestigate depends on the fact that they have acquired concepts as\npart of growing up. This process did not involve assent, and\naccordingly, Sextus argues that the skeptic\u2019s ability to think\ndoes not violate suspension of judgment (cf. Brunschwig 1988; Vogt\n2012a ch. 6; Grgic 2008; Fine 2011). It is conceivable, though, that\nthe skeptic\u2019s ability to understand involves some knowledge,\nnamely a kind of knowledge that does not entail any belief (Corti\n2009, part III; Corti 2015). This option appears counterintuitive\ngiven today\u2019s premises in epistemology, according to which\nsomeone who knows that p also believes that p. The relevant notion of\nbelief in skeptical discussions, doxa, as well as the\nrelevant ancient notions of knowledge, however, may behave quite\ndifferently (cf. Vogt 2012a and Moss and Schwab 2019 on belief;\nBurnyeat 1980c, Frede 2008 and Schwab 2016 on knowledge). Insofar as\ndoxa is an inherently deficient activity and attitude, and\ninsofar as knowledge is conceived in elevated ways, knowledge without\nbelief is a rather intuitive option within ancient epistemology. If\nunderstanding concepts and arguments involves knowledge that does not\nentail beliefs, the skeptics may be taken to have such knowledge.\nModern critics raise the further question of whether the skeptic must\nendorse logical laws (such as the Principle of Non-Contradiction) and\nrules of inference. In particular, they ask whether a skeptic is\ncommitted to the logical validity of the conditionals they formulate\nwhen arguing against the dogmatists (Sorensen 2004). Sextus records no\nancient version of this complaint, and accordingly no direct\nresponse. Relatedly, one may ask whether Sextus\u2019 method, in\nparticular regarding the Five Modes, is systematic in a way that is in\ntension with suspension of judgment (cf. Sienkiewicz 2021, who defends\nSextus against this charge).\n\n(iii) Belief. Bury, in his Loeb translation, translates\nadoxast\u00f4s as \u201cundogmatically,\u201d for example,\nwhen Sextus speaks (PH 1.15) of skeptics as saying that\n\u201cnothing is true.\u201d This translation suggests that Sextus\nbans dogmatism from the skeptic\u2019s life, where this still leaves\nroom for other, non-dogmatic beliefs. But adoxast\u00f4s\nmeans non-doxastically or \u2018without belief\u2019 (cf. Burnyeat\n1980 [1997]). As noted above, the skeptic\u2019s end is tranquility\nin matters relating to belief\u2014kata doxan. A skeptic\nlives adoxast\u00f4s. And even more confusingly, the\nskeptics assent adoxast\u00f4s, when they act.\n\nContemporary interest in Pyrrhonian skepticism was much spurred by\nMichael Frede\u2019s paper \u201cThe Sceptic\u2019s Beliefs\u201d\n(1979 [1997]). Frede argues that ancient skepticism was traditionally\ndismissed too easily as vulnerable to the Apraxia Charge, the charge\nthat, without belief, the skeptic cannot act. The skeptics seem to be\nconfident that they have replies to this objection. Thus, it seems\nuncharitable not to look closely at these replies. Further, insofar as\nthese replies respond to the charge that without belief one cannot\nact, we should focus on what the skeptics say about the role of belief\nin their lives. Frede cites PH 1.13, and claims that in this\npassage we find a distinction between two kinds of belief:\n\nWhen we say that the skeptic does not dogmatize, we are not using\n\u2018dogma\u2019 in the more general sense in which some say it is\ndogma to accept anything (for the skeptic does assent to the\nexperiences forced upon him in virtue of this-or-that impression: for\nexample, he would not say, when warmed or cooled, \u2018I seem not to\nbe warmed or cooled\u2019). Rather, when we say he does not\ndogmatize, we mean \u2018dogma\u2019 in the sense in which some say\nthat dogma is assent to any of the non-evident matters investigated by\nthe sciences. For the Pyrrhonist assents to nothing that is\nnon-evident. (PH 1.13; trans. Burnyeat (1984) [1997] with\nchanges)\n\n\nFollowing Frede, several scholars focus on PH 1.13 when\ndiscussing skeptical belief (with the notable exceptions of Barnes\n1980 [1997] and Barney 1992). They take it to be obvious that, in this\nparagraph, Sextus distinguishes between two kinds of belief, one which\nhe bans from the skeptic\u2019s life, and one which he allows into\nthe skeptic\u2019s life. Barnes (1982 [1997]) employs a distinction\nbetween rustic and urbane skepticism. The rustic skeptic suspends on\nall matters. The urbane skeptic suspends on scientific matters, but\nholds ordinary beliefs. The clause \u201cnon-evident matters\ninvestigated in the sciences\u201d in PH 1.13 might be taken\nas a point of reference for the urbane interpretation. However, Barnes\npoints out that this cannot be right. Everything can be considered as\na non-evident matter, even such things as whether honey is sweet.\n\nAgainst Barnes, Frede argues that the relevant distinction must be\ndrawn between two kinds of assent, such that \u201chaving a view\ninvolves one kind of assent, whereas taking a position, or making a\nclaim, involves another kind of assent, namely the kind of assent the\nsceptic will withhold\u201d (1984 [1997], 128). Sextus characterizes\nskeptical assent in three ways. He speaks of forced assent (PH\n1.23\u201324), involuntary assent (PH 1.19), and\nadoxast\u00f4s assent (PH 2.102). Frede does not explore the\ndetails of how Sextus uses these notions. The core of his proposal is\nthat Sextus allows for a kind of assent that does not involve a claim\nas to how things are in actual fact.\n\nIn (1979 [1997]), Frede is predominantly concerned with the\nskeptic\u2019s reply to the Apraxia Charge. In (1984 [1997]) his\nfocus is on skeptical pronouncements such as \u201cnothing can be\nknown.\u201d His distinction between two kinds of assent, and\naccordingly two kinds of belief, is explored with respect to such\nsentences. Frede writes that \u201c[t]o be left with the impression\nor thought that p [\u2026] does not involve the further thought that\nit is true that p\u201d (133). This is the sense in which, on his\ninterpretation, the skeptic might think \u201cnothing is\nknown.\u201d The thought counts as a belief, but not as a claim that,\nin actual fact, nothing is known by anybody. Contrary to Frede\u2019s\ninterpretation, one might argue that to believe simply is to hold\ntrue, at least according to the notions of belief that the skeptics\ninvoke in discussions with their contemporary critics (Vogt 2012b). It\nis thus not clear that Frede\u2019s distinction is genuinely one\nbetween two kinds of beliefs (Burnyeat 1980 [1997]). Perhaps it is a\ndistinction between two different propositional attitudes, only one of\nwhich is belief. As Striker (2001) points out, there is a danger that\ndebates over this issue become merely terminological. We might thus\ndraw a distinction between two issues. It is one thing to disagree\nwith Frede on what should or should not be called belief, and another\nto dispute whether he identifies and characterizes a phenomenon in the\nskeptic\u2019s mental life. As Frede argues, skeptics find themselves\nwith a rather persistent thought, without having accepted it as true\nin actual fact. This appears to capture a core element of skepticism:\nthe way in which the skeptic thinks such thoughts as \u201ceverything\nis inapprehensible.\u201d\n\n(iv) The Skeptical Formulae. PH 1.13, the passage in which\nscholars find a distinction between two kinds of belief, occurs in a\nchapter entitled \u201cDoes the Skeptic dogmatize?\u201d One angle\nfrom which we might disagree with Frede is to insist that PH\n1.13 addresses the status of the core thoughts of skeptical\nphilosophy, rather than the question of skeptical belief. Consider the\nrest of the chapter:\n\nNot even in uttering the skeptical formulae about unclear\nmatters\u2014for example, \u201cIn no way more,\u201d or \u201cI\ndetermine nothing,\u201d or one of the other formulae which we shall\nlater discuss\u2014do they dogmatize (dogmatizein). For if\nyou dogmatize, then you posit as real the things that you are said to\ndogmatize about; but skeptics posit these formulae not as necessarily\nbeing real. For they suppose that, just as the formula\n\u201cEverything is false\u201d says that it too, along with\neverything else, is false (and similarly for \u201cNothing is\ntrue\u201d), so also \u201cIn no way more\u201d says that it too,\nalong with everything else, is no more so than not so, and hence\ncancels itself along with everything else. And we say the same of the\nother skeptical formulae. Thus, if people who dogmatize posit as real\nthe things they dogmatize about, while skeptics utter their own\nphrases in such a way that they are implicitly cancelled by\nthemselves, then they cannot be said to dogmatize in uttering them.\nBut the main point is this: in uttering these formulae they say what\nappears to themselves and report their own feelings without any belief\n(adoxast\u00f4s), affirming nothing about external objects.\n(PH 1.14\u201315; trans. Annas-Barnes with changes)\n\n\nWhen explaining in PH 1.13 how the skeptic does not\ndogmatize, Sextus may have a particular issue in mind: that some\nskeptical formulae look like doctrines, and have traditionally been\nturned against themselves due to their dogmatic surface-structure. For\nexample, \u201call things are indeterminate\u201d looks like a\nstraightforward dogmatic statement. There is a long history of\nskeptical attempts to explain the nature of such pronouncements so\nthat they no longer undermine themselves. Sextus arguably mentions\nseveral solutions to this problem (PH 1.13\u201315 and\n1.187\u2013209; cf. Pellegrin 2010). In PH 1.15, Sextus\nidentifies the following as his main point: the skeptic merely reports\nwhat appears to them. Along these lines, Sextus calls indeterminacy an\naffection of thought (pathos dianoias; PH 1.198), a\nstate that the utterance \u201call things are indeterminate\u201d\naims to capture. The other solution mentioned in PH\n1.14\u201315 is somewhat more problematic: the skeptical formulae\ncancel themselves out. That is, one can say them and convey something\nthrough them. But then, once one has made a point, they as it were\nturn back upon themselves and eat themselves up\u2014as fire first\nburns combustible materials and then destroys itself. This idea became\nfamous through another comparison Sextus uses (invoked by Wittgenstein\n1922, 6.54): the skeptical pronouncements are like a ladder that\none climbs up; once one is on top, one can throw the ladder away\n(M 8.481). Scholars disagree on whether Sextus in some sense\nadmits that these statements are self-refuting (McPherran 1987), or\nwhether he defuses their self-refutational structure (Castagnoli 2010,\nIII.14).\n\n(v) Appearances (phainomena). While it is difficult to\nestablish a clear distinction between two kinds of belief in Sextus,\nthere is a comparatively more explicit distinction between two ways of\nengaging with appearances. Sextus says that, while things\nappear X to the skeptic, the skeptic does not affirm that\nthey are X. Questions that are traditionally discussed in\nterms of whether the skeptic has beliefs thus might be addressed in\nterms of whether the way things appear to the skeptic has a\njudgment-component. Arguably, \u201cA appears X to\nme now\u201d can be construed in different ways. Certain examples\n(say, the way in which it makes sense to say both that the moon\nappears small and that it appears large) may suggest that appearance\ncan but need not involve something like a judgment (Barney 1992). Some\nformulations in Sextus seem to insist on a significant difference\nbetween the mental activity of something appearing to a cognizer on\nthe one hand, and on the other hand the mental activity that, on the\nlevel of language, is represented by assertion. This suggests that,\nfor Sextus, A appearing F to me now does not entail\nthat I hold it to be true that A is F (Vogt\n2012b).\n\n(vi) Language. Another approach to the question of whether the skeptic\nhas beliefs looks at skeptical language. Sextus insists that the\nskeptic does not accept or reject any impression, and associates the\nabsence of these mental acts with the fact that the skeptic does not\naffirm or deny anything (e.g., PH 1.4, 7, 10). Arguably, we\ncan infer from Sextus\u2019 account of the skeptic\u2019s utterances\nwhat Sextus wants to say about the skeptic\u2019s mental states and\nacts. That is, the question of language immediately bears on the\nquestion of belief. The report on Pyrrhonian skepticism in Diogenes\nLaertius is particularly instructive in this respect. Contrary to\nscholarly focus on belief in reconstructing skepticism, it barely\nmentions belief. Discussion of the skeptics\u2019 attitudes is almost\nentirely conducted in terms of skeptical language and the skeptical\nformulae (for detailed discussion of the relevant paragraphs, DL\n9.74\u20137, cf. Corti 2015). If Sextus is read in light of the\nreport in DL IX, PH 1.13 may appear to be more of an isolated\npassage than scholarly debates imply. Sextus too devotes much space to\naccounts of skeptical expressions and language. It may thus be asked\nwhether scholars should reframe discussions, and pay more attention to\nskeptical language then they previously have. As of now, there is one\nmonograph on skeptical language, Corti (2009), and one approach to\nbelief that focuses on language, Vogt (1998). Both scholars pursue\nfurther ideas put forward by Barnes (1982 [1997]), who compares the\nskeptic\u2019s utterances to avowals. The skeptic lays open their\nstate of mind, they announce or record (apangellein) it (Fine\n2003a). In order to do this, the skeptic must misuse language\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]). Some strategies to avoid assertion are given\nin the context of the skeptical formulae (\u201cnon-assertion,\u201d\n\u201cI determine nothing,\u201d and so on). (i) Skeptical\nexpressions can be used as signs, which reveal a state of mind\n(PH 1.187). (ii) Expressions like \u201cou\nmallon\u201d (no more) and \u201couden mallon\u201d\n(nowise more) can be used indifferently (in the sense of\ninterchangeably) (PH 1.188). (iii) As is the practice in\nordinary language, the skeptic can use expressions elliptically; for\nexample \u201cno more\u201d for \u201cno more this-than-that\u201d\n(PH 1.188). (iv) People often use questions instead of\nassertions and the other way around. Similarly, \u201cno more\u201d\ncan be construed as a question: \u201cWhy more this-than-that?\u201d\n(v) The skeptic misuses language and uses it in a loose way\n(PH 1.191).\n\nIn M 1 and M 2, Sextus says that the skeptic goes\nalong with ordinary ways of using language (M 1.172, 193, 206, 218,\n229, 233; M 2.52\u20133, 58\u20139). This seems to be a key resource\nin construing skeptical ways of speaking: the skeptic exploits the\nways in which ordinary speakers can diverge from grammatically correct\nspeech, and still be understood. Apart from using their skeptical\nformulae, and apart from conducting philosophical investigations,\nwhich they can do in a dialectical mode, referring to theses,\narguments, and inferences, the skeptic also has to talk in everyday\ncontexts. It is here where we see best how skeptical utterances are\ntailored to reveal a state of mind in which nothing is accepted or\nrejected. Sextus takes great pains to construe his examples of\nskeptical utterances according to the following schema:\n\u201cX appears F to me now.\u201d This will\ngenerally be understood as an elliptical version of \u201cX\nappears to be F to me now.\u201d However, Sextus\nconsistently avoids \u201cto be\u201d (Vogt 1998; for the view that\n\u201cX appears F\u201d avoids reference to external\nobjects, see Everson 1991). The peculiar form of skeptical utterances\nsuggests that Sextus sees a relevant difference between\n\u201cX appears to be F to me now\u201d and\n\u201cX appears F to me now.\u201d The former\nmight imply reference to a state of affairs, and an epistemic usage of\n\u201cto appear\u201d that could be rendered as \u201cIt appears to\nme, that p,\u201d or, \u201cI take it that p.\u201d This, however,\nwould be assertoric: the skeptic would state that it appears to them\nthat such-and-such is the case. But the skeptic\u2019s elliptical\nutterances about what appears to them aim to be purely\nphenomenological. They aim to report a condition of the\nskeptic\u2019s mind, without expressing a judgment of any kind\n(Burnyeat 1984 [1997]; Annas-Barnes 1985, 23\u20134; for an\nassessment of these strategies in terms of modern philosophy of\nlanguage, cf. Pagin 2020). As part of the skeptics\u2019 way of life,\nlanguage can also be seen as an activity. That is, how the skeptics\ncan speak can be considered a sub\u2013question of how the skeptics\ncan act. Skeptical utterances have been compared to Wittgensteinian\nconfessions, arguably a kind of speech act that is consistent with the\nskeptics\u2019 avoidance of belief (Corti 2009, Parts I and II).\nMoreover, the skeptics not only speak. They presumably also understand\nwhat others say. A persuasive account of skeptical language must\nexplain both speaking and understanding (Corti 2009, Part III).\n\n(vii) Action. Sextus says that appearances (phainomena) are\nthe practical criterion of the skeptic (PH 1.23\u201324). By\nadhering to appearances, the skeptic is prevented from inactivity\n(anenerg\u00easia). Note that Sextus does not describe the\nskeptic as performing actions in the sense of dogmatic theory of\naction, which involves belief and choice (cf. M\n11.162\u2013166). Contrary to the Academic skeptic, a Sextan skeptic\ndoes not view themselves as a rational agent, who chooses one course\nof action over another. Sextus claims an active life for the skeptic,\nbut not the life of a rational agent, as conceived by dogmatic\nphilosophers (Vogt 2010; Schwab 2020). This attitude has been\ncritically discussed for a long time, for example, with respect to its\nethical (Bett 2019) and political upshots (Marchand 2015) and with\nrespect to the skeptics\u2019 relation to the law (Marchand\n2021).\n\nThe skeptic\u2019s forced assent is situated in the domain of action\n(PH 1.13, 19, 29\u201330, 193, 237\u20138). Thirst, for\nexample, necessitates assent, and that means, it moves the skeptic to\ndrink. This kind of assent may be genuinely unrelated to\nbelief-formation of any kind. Rather, forced assent generates the\nmovement of action. But what about more complex kinds of activities,\nsuch as applying a medication, or attending a festival? Sextus argues\nthat the skeptic adheres to custom, convention, and tradition, and to\nwhat they have been trained to do. In explaining how adherence to\nappearances in these domains generates activity, Sextus does not\nmention assent. However, he might have to concede that, like drinking\nwhen thirsty, more complex actions also involve some kind of assent.\nIn PH 2.102, Sextus says that the sceptic assents\nnon-doxastically (adoxast\u00f4s) to the things relied on in\nordinary life. In PH 1.19, he mentions involuntary assent.\nAccordingly, non-doxastic and involuntary assent may figure in those\ndomains of skeptical action that do not involve necessitation by\nbodily affections. Non-doxastic assent is, from the point of view of\nthe Stoics, a contradiction in terms, just like forced and involuntary\nassent. Assent is defined as in our power, and as that by which\nbeliefs are formed. If Sextus intends skeptical assent to be genuinely\nnon-doxastic and involuntary, then it does not have the core features\nof assent as defined by the dogmatists.\n\n(viii) Logic, Physics, Ethics, and the \u201cdisciplines.\u201d The\nspecial arguments of the skeptic are directed against particular\ntheories in the three disciplines of Hellenistic philosophy: logic,\nphysics, and ethics. In addition, they address the so-called\ndisciplines, namely grammar, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,\nastrology, and music-theory. Sextus\u2019 treatments of logic divide\nup into two main topics: sign and criterion (cf. Bett 2005 on signs).\nThis structure reflects central concerns of Hellenistic epistemology\nas well as of ancient skepticism. Skepticism looks for a\n\u2018decider\u2019 between conflicting appearances and thoughts. A\ndecider could be something evident. Dogmatic philosophers associate\nthe evident with the criterion of truth. For something to serve the\nrole of criterion, it cannot be equally disputed as the matters it\nhelps to decide. Or something non-evident could take on the role of\ndecider. For that to be the case, the skeptics argue, it would have to\nbe conclusively revealed by a sign or proof. If there is no compelling\ntheory of the criterion and no compelling account of sign and proof,\nthen there is nothing that can decide between several conflicting\nviews. Sextus\u2019 treatises on logic thus are not simply a\ncollection of individual arguments against various dogmatic theories.\nTheir main line of thought sketches a route into\nskepticism. Along these lines, Vlasits (2020b) argues that\nSextus\u2019 treatment of logic in PH 2 is unified. Sextus\u2019\nargument is structured such as to lead to suspension of judgment on\nthe methodologies of the dogmatists. The final section of M 8 (463\u201381)\nformulates a challenge for the skeptic that scholars interested in\nself-refutational arguments have examined (Castagnoli 2010): does the\nskeptic aim to prove that proof does not exist (Sienkiewicz\n2022)?\n\nSextus\u2019 discussions of ethics also focus on issues that\nplausibly lead into skepticism. Again, there are two central\nquestions: whether there is anything good and bad by nature; and\nwhether there is an art of life (Bett 2010, 2011 and 2019),\nas the Epicureans and Stoics claim there is. If we could settle what\nis good and what is bad, some of the most disturbing anomalies would\nbe resolved. If there were an art of life, there would be a teachable\nbody of knowledge about the good and the bad. In both cases, questions\nthat can cause a great deal of puzzlement would be resolved.\nSextus\u2019 discussions of ethics are in part famous because Sextus\nascribes outlandish and shocking views to the Stoics. As Sextus\nconstrues his arguments, the contrast between \u2018ordinary\nlife\u2019 and philosophical views leads to suspension of judgment\n(Vogt 2008a, ch. 1). In the modern tradition, a number of philosophers\nincluding Hegel and Nietzsche have engaged with aspects of\nSextus\u2019 outlook and in particular with the skeptical adherence\nto ordinary life (Berry 2010 and 2020; Bett 2020a). Recently,\nscholars have asked how ethical a skeptic can be, to use a phrased\nemployed by Bett (2019), given that it may seem that suspension of\njudgment on grave ethical challenges can seem facile. At the same\ntime, scholars point out that some dimensions of ethical frameworks\nwent unquestioned a long time, for example, with respect to gender;\nhere suspension of judgment may appear innovative (Olfert\nforthcoming).\n\nThe books on physics discuss god, cause, matter, bodies, mixture,\nmotion, increase and decrease, subtraction and addition, whole and\npart, change, becoming and perishing, rest, place, time, and number.\nNotably, god is one of the topics explored in physics. This stands in\nstark contrast to medieval and early modern discussions, where the\nquest for knowledge of God often frames and motivates engagement with\nskepticism. In PH 3, Sextus prefaces his discussion of arguments\nfor and against the existence of gods by saying that the\nskeptics\u2019 ordinary life without opinions\n(adoxast\u00f4s) includes the following: the skeptics say\nthat there are gods, are pious toward the gods, and say that the gods\nare provident. Scholars discuss how this relates to Sextus\u2019\ndiscussions of theology qua topic in physics on the one hand (PH\n3.2\u201312, M 9.11\u2013194), and to his portrayal of the skeptics\u2019\nordinary life in PH 1 on the other hand (Annas 2011, Veres 2020a). The\nskeptics come to suspend judgment on all central questions in ancient\nphysics (Bett 2012). This means, they come to suspend judgment on\nwhether, for example, there are causes, time, place, and bodies (cf.\nBobzien 2015 and Warren 2015). Their suspension does not merely mean\nthat they have not yet found a satisfying theory of, say, body. It\nmeans that they find themselves unable to say whether there is body\n(Burnyeat 1997). (On the cumulative force of these arguments, see\nsection 5.4.)\n\nThe six books entitled Against those in the Disciplines\n(M 1\u20136) have traditionally received less attention.\nOnly in the last few years have scholars begun to explore them with\nthe kind of philosophical subtlety that has been brought to bear in\nthe study of ancient skepticism in recent decades. M\n1\u20136 skeptically examine six fields of study, namely grammar,\nrhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music-theory. Sextus\nbegins with an astonishing move. Contrary to his usual strategy of\nemphasizing the distance between skeptics and dogmatists, he admits\nthat Pyrrhonians and Epicureans share much in viewing standard\ndisciplines as useless (M 1.1\u20137; cf. Thorsrud 2019).\nGenerally speaking, increased attention to M 1\u20136 may\nprovide additional occasion to modify the long-standing assumption\nthat the Stoics are Sextus\u2019 most important dogmatic\ninterlocutors. Throughout M 1\u20136, resonances between\nEpicurean and Pyrrhonian philosophy are remarkably visible (Bett 2018,\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d). Engagement with Epicurean philosophy\nshapes Sextus\u2019 approach deeply, to the extent that both schools,\nStoics and Epicureans, should be considered fundamental points of\nreference.\n\nAfter his remarks on how Pyrrhonians and Epicureans take issue with\nthe presumed usefulness of the disciplines, Sextus lays out general\narguments, suitable for skeptical examination of any field. He argues\nthat, for there to be a discipline, there must be the matter being\ntaught, the teacher, the learner, and the means of learning. If,\nhowever, neither of these things exists, then the discipline\ndoesn\u2019t exist. This is how Sextus proceeds. He argues, or seems\nto argue, for the non-existence of the disciplines (M 1.9).\nAlready in the very first sentence of M 1, Sextus describes\nhis own approach as one of putting forward counterarguments, a\nstrategy that he mentions repeatedly throughout M\n1\u20136.\n\nThese moves give rise to the most contentious question regarding\nM 1\u20136. Are these books negatively dogmatic? Or do they\nfit in with Sextus\u2019s outlook in PH 1\u20133, where\nskeptical arguments are described as leading up to suspension of\njudgment? Bett (2018, \u201cIntroduction\u201d) argues that, with\nsome qualifications, Sextus\u2019 approach is to be explained as\nfollows. Sextus lays out counterarguments based on the assumption that\nthe arguments of the dogmatists have already been formulated. For\nthere to be arguments of equal weight on both sides, only the\nanti-dogmatic arguments need to be adduced. The intended effect is\nthat jointly, these opposing sets of arguments lead us to suspend\njudgment. In addition, Bett notes that the remarkable emphasis on\ncounterarguments, non-existence, and uselessness suggests that some of\nthe material in M 1\u20136 goes back to an earlier phase of\nPyrrhonism.\n\nIn four of the six fields, namely grammar, rhetoric, music, and\nastrology, Sextus admits non-technical versions into the\nskeptic\u2019s life, while subjecting all theoretical claims to\nskeptical examination. For example, he distinguishes between the\nordinary ability to read and write on the one hand and grammar as a\ntechnical discipline on the other, or the ability to play a musical\ninstrument on the one hand and music theory on the other (cf. Corti\n2015b on why this kind of contrast does not come up in the books on\narithmetic and geometry, Corti 2015c on Sextus\u2019 attack on\nthe Platonic-Pythagorean notion of the Two, and Corti\nforthcoming).\n\nIt is remarkable that, qua theoretical field, Sextus examines\nastrology rather than astronomy. The latter would make for a more\ntypical sequence: apart from the fact that in Sextus, logic is\nconsidered part of philosophy rather than a \u201cdiscipline,\u201d\nthe six fields otherwise correspond to the so-called trivium of\ngrammar, logic, and rhetoric and quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy, and music theory. Sextus\u2019 attention to astrology\nrather than astronomy highlights a deep feature of his philosophy\n(Corti 2015, Bett 2018). Astronomy, from Sextus\u2019 point of view,\nis concerned with appearances; and hence there is a sense in which the\nskeptic does not object to it. Astronomy, then, is the\n\u201cversion\u201d of astrology that skeptics can admit into their\nadherence to ordinary life (M 5.1\u20133). Presumably,\nastronomy is concerned with predicting things like droughts, floods,\nearthquakes, and plagues based on appearances. Astrology, on the other\nhand, is concerned with matters of great obscurity.\n",
