    "main_text": "Descriptions and Analysis\n5. Descriptions and Analysis\n\nFrege did not distinguish (or at least did not emphasize any\ndistinction between) names like \u2018John\u2019 and descriptions\nlike \u2018the boy\u2019 or \u2018the tall boy from Canada\u2019.\nInitially, both kinds of expression seem to indicate arguments, as\nopposed to functions. So one might think that the logical form of\n\u2018The boy sang\u2019 is simply \u2018\\(S(b)\\)\u2019, where\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 is an unstructured symbol that stands for the boy in\nquestion (and presents him in a certain way). But this makes the\nelements of a description logically irrelevant. And this seems wrong.\nIf the tall boy from Canada sang, then some boy from Canada sang.\nMoreover, \u2018the\u2019 implies uniqueness in a way that\n\u2018some\u2019 does not. Of course, one can say \u2018The boy\nsang\u2019 without denying that universe contains more than one boy.\nBut likewise, in ordinary conversation, one can say \u2018Everything\nis in the trunk\u2019 without denying that the universe contains some\nthings not in the trunk. And intuitively, a speaker who uses\n\u2018the\u2019 does imply that the adjacent predicate is satisfied\nby exactly one contextually relevant thing.\n\nBertrand Russell\n held that these implications reflect the logical form of a\nproposition expressed (in a given context) with a definite\ndescription. On his view, \u2018The boy sang\u2019 has the following\nlogical form:\n\n\\[\\exists x \\{\\textrm{Boy}(x) \\land \\forall y [\\textrm{Boy}(y) \\rightarrow y = x] \\land S(x)\\}\n\\]\n\n\nsome individual\\(x\\) is such that\nhe\\(x\\) is a boy, and every (relevant)\nindividual\\(y\\) is such that if he\\(y\\) is\na boy, then he\\(y\\) is identical with\nhim\\(x\\), and he\\(x\\) sang. The awkward\nmiddle conjunct was Russell\u2019s way of expressing uniqueness with\nFregean tools; cf.\n section seven.\n But rewriting the middle conjunct would not affect Russell\u2019s\ntechnical point, which is that \u2018the boy\u2019 does not\ncorrespond to any constituent of the formalism. This in turn reflects\nRussell\u2019s central claim\u2014viz., that while a speaker may\nrefer to a certain boy in saying \u2018The boy sang\u2019, the boy\nin question is not a constituent of the proposition indicated.\nAccording to Russell, the proposition has the form of an existential\nquantification with a bound variable. It does not have the\nform of a function saturated by (an argument that is) the boy referred\nto. The proposition is general rather than singular. In this respect,\n\u2018the boy\u2019 is like \u2018some boy\u2019 and \u2018every\nboy\u2019; though on Russell\u2019s view, not even \u2018the\u2019\nindicates a constituent of the proposition expressed.\n\nThis extended Frege\u2019s idea that natural language misleads us\nabout the structure of the propositions we assert. Russell went on to\napply this hypothesis to what became a famous puzzle. Even though\nFrance is currently kingless, \u2018The present king of France is\nbald\u2019 can be used to express a proposition. The sentence is not\nmeaningless; it has implications. So if the proposition consists of a\nfunction indicated with \u2018\\(\\textrm{Bald}(\\ )\\)\u2019 and an argument\nindicated with \u2018The present king of France\u2019, there must\nbe an argument that is indicated. But appeal to nonexistent\nkings is, to say the least, dubious. Russell concluded that \u2018The\npresent king of France is bald\u2019 expresses a quantificational\nproposition:\n\n\\[\\exists x \\{K(x) \\land \\forall y [K(y) \\rightarrow y = x] \\land B(x)\\};\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(K(x) = \\textbf{T}\\) iff \\(x\\) is a present king of\nFrance, and \\(B(x) = \\textbf{T}\\) iff \\(x\\) is bald. (For present\npurposes, set aside worries about the vagueness of\n\u2018bald\u2019.) And as Russell noted, the following contrary\nreasoning is spurious: every proposition is true or false; so the\npresent king of France is bald or not; so there is a king of France,\nand he is either bald or not. For let P be the\nproposition that the king of France is bald. Russell held that\nP is indeed true or false. On his view, it is false.\nGiven that \\(\\neg \\exists x [K(x)]\\), it follows that\n\n\\[\n\\neg \\exists x \\{K(x) \\land \\forall y [K(y) \\rightarrow y = x] \\land B(x)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nBut it does not follow\nthat there is a present king of France who is either bald or not.\nGiven that \\(\\neg \\exists x [K(x)]\\), it hardly follows that\n\n\\[\\exists x \\{K(x) \\land [B(x) \\lor \\neg B(x)]\\}.\\]\n\n\nSo we must not confuse the negation of\nP with the following false proposition:\n\n\\[\\exists x \\{K(x) \\land \\forall y [K(y) \\rightarrow y = x] \\land \\neg B(x)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nThe ambiguity of natural language may foster such confusion, given\nexamples like \u2018The present king of France is bald or\nnot\u2019. But according to Russell, puzzles about\n\u201cnonexistence\u201d can be resolved without special\nmetaphysical theses, given the right views about logical form and\nnatural language.\n\nThis invited the thought that other philosophical puzzles might\ndissolve if we properly understood the logical forms of our\nclaims.\n Ludwig Wittgenstein\n argued, in his influential Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,\nthat: (i) the very possibility of meaningful sentences, which can be\ntrue or false depending on how the world is, requires propositions\nwith structures of the sort that Frege and Russell were getting at;\n(ii) all propositions are logical compounds of\u2014and thus\nanalyzable into\u2014atomic propositions that are inferentially\nindependent of one another; though (iii) even simple natural language\nsentences may correspond to very complex propositions; and (iv) the\nright analyses would, given a little reflection, reveal all\nphilosophical puzzles as confusions about how language is related to\nthe world. Wittgenstein later noted that examples like \u2018This is\nred\u2019 and \u2018This is yellow\u2019 present difficulties for\nhis earlier view. (If the expressed propositions are unanalyzable, and\nthus logically independent, each should be compatible with the other;\nbut at least so far, no one has provided a plausible analysis that\naccounts for the apparent impeccability of \u2018This is red, so this\nis not yellow\u2019. This raises questions about whether all\ninferential security is due to logical form.) And in any case, Russell\ndid not endorse (iv). But he did say, for reasons related to certain\nepistemological puzzles, that (a) we are directly acquainted\nwith the constituents of those propositions into which every\nproposition (that we can grasp) can be analyzed; (b) at least\ntypically, we are not directly acquainted with the mind-independent\nbearers of proper names; and so (c) the things we typically refer to\nwith names are not constituents of basic propositions.\n\nThis led Russell to say that natural language names are disguised\ndescriptions. On this view, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 is semantically\nassociated with a complex predicate\u2014say, for illustration, a\npredicate of the form \u2018\\(E(x) \\land S(x)\\)\u2019, suggesting\n\u2018evening star\u2019. In which case, \u2018Hesperus is\nbright\u2019 expresses a proposition of the form \n\n\\[\\lsquo\\exists x \\{[E(x) \\land S(x)] \\land\n\\forall y \\{[E(y) \\land S(y)] \\rightarrow y = x\\} \\land\nB(x)\\}\\rsquo.\n\\]\n\n\nIt also follows that Hesperus exists iff\n\\(\\exists x [E(x) \\land S(x)]\\); and this would be challenged by\nKripke (1980) and others; see the entries on\n rigid-designators\n and\n names.  But by analyzing names as\n descriptions\u2014quantificational expressions, as opposed to logical\nconstants (like \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019) that indicate\nindividuals\u2014Russell offered an attractive account of why the\nproposition that Hesperus is bright differs from the proposition that\nPhosphorus is bright. Instead of saying that propositional\nconstituents are Fregean senses, Russell could say that\n\u2018Phosphorus is bright\u2019 expresses a proposition of the\nform\n\n\\[\\lsquo\\exists x \\{[M(x) \\land S(x)] \\land\n\\forall y \\{[M(y) \\land S(y)] \\rightarrow y = x\\} \\land\nB(x)\\}\\rsquo ;\\]\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(E(x)\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(M(x)\\)\u2019 indicate different functions, specified\n(respectively) in terms of evenings and mornings. This leaves room for\nthe discovery that the complex predicates \u2018\\(E(x) \\land\nS(x)\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(M(x) \\land S(x)\\)\u2019 both indicate\nfunctions that map Venus and nothing else to the\ntruth-value T.  The hypothesis was that the\npropositions expressed with \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus is bright\u2019 have different (fundamental)\nconstituents, even though Hesperus is Phosphorus, but not because\npropositional constituents are \u201cways of presenting\u201d\nBedeutungen. Similarly, the idea was that the propositions expressed\nwith \u2018Hesperus is Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus is\nPhosphorus\u2019 differ, because only the latter has\npredicational/unsaturated constituents corresponding to\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019. Positing unexpected logical forms seemed to\nhave explanatory payoffs.\n\nQuestions about names and descriptions are also related to\npsychological reports, like \u2018Mary thinks Venus is bright\u2019,\nwhich present puzzles of their own; see the entry on\n propositional attitude reports.\n Such reports seem to indicate propositions that are neither atomic\nnor logical compounds of simpler propositions. For as Frege noted,\nreplacing one name with another name for the same object can\napparently affect the truth of a psychological report. If Mary fails\nto know that Hesperus is Venus, she might think Venus is a planet\nwithout thinking Hesperus is a planet; though cp. Soames (1987, 1995,\n2002) and see the entry on\n singular propositions.\n Any function that has the value T given Venus as\nargument has the value T given Hesperus as argument.\nSo Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein all held\u2014in varying\nways\u2014that psychological reports are also misleading with respect\nto the logical forms of the indicated propositions.\n6. Regimentation and Communicative Slack\n\nWithin the analytic tradition inspired by these philosophers, it\nbecame a commonplace that logical form and grammatical form typically\ndiverge, often in dramatic ways. This invited attempts to provide both\nanalyses of propositions and claims about natural language, with the\naim of saying how relatively simple sentences (with subject-predicate\nstructures) could be used to express propositions (with\nfunction-argument structures).\n\nThe logical positivists explored the idea that the meaning of a\nsentence is a procedure for determining the truth or falsity of that\nsentence. From this perspective, studies of linguistic meaning and\npropositional structure still dovetail, even if natural language\nemploys \u201cconventions\u201d that make it possible to indicate\ncomplex propositions with grammatically simple sentences; see the\nentry on\n analysis.\n But to cut short a long and interesting story, there was little\nsuccess in formulating \u201csemantic rules\u201d that were\nplausible both as (i) descriptions of how ordinary speakers understand\nsentences of natural language, and (ii) analyses that revealed logical\nstructure of the sort envisioned. (And until Montague [1970],\ndiscussed briefly in the next section, there was no real progress in\nshowing how to systematically associate quantificational constructions\nof natural language with Fregean logical forms.)\n\nRudolf Carnap,\n one of the leading positivists, responded to difficulties facing his\nearlier views by developing a sophisticated position according to\nwhich philosophers could (and should) articulate alternative sets of\nconventions for associating sentences of a language with propositions.\nWithin each such language, the conventions would determine what\nfollows from what. But one would have to decide, on broadly pragmatic\ngrounds, which interpreted language was best for certain purposes\n(like conducting scientific inquiry). On this view, questions about\n\u201cthe\u201d logical form of an ordinary sentence are in part\nquestions about which conventions one should adopt. The idea was that\n\u201cinternal\u201d to any logically perspicuous linguistic scheme,\nthere would be an answer to the question of how two sentences are\ninferentially related. But \u201cexternal\u201d questions, about\nwhich conventions we should adopt, would not be settled by descriptive\nfacts about how we understand languages that we already use.\n\nThis was, in many ways, an attractive development of Frege\u2019s\nvision. But it also raised a skeptical worry. Perhaps the structural\nmismatches between sentences of a natural language and sentences of a\nFregean Begriffsschrift are so severe that one cannot formulate\ngeneral rules for associating the sentences we ordinarily use with\npropositions. Later theorists would combine this view with the idea\nthat propositions are sentences of a\n mental language\n that is relevantly like Frege\u2019s invented language and\nrelevantly unlike the spoken languages humans use to communicate; see\nFodor (1975, 1978). But given the rise of\n behaviorism,\n both in philosophy and psychology, this variant on a medieval idea\nwas initially ignored or ridiculed. (And it does face difficulties;\nsee\n section eight.)\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine\n combined behaviorist psychology with a normative conception of\nlogical form similar to Carnap\u2019s. The result was an influential\nview according to which there is no fact of the matter about which\nproposition a speaker/thinker expresses with a sentence of natural\nlanguage, because talk of propositions is (at best) a way of talking\nabout how we should regiment our verbal behavior for certain\npurposes\u2014and in particular, for purposes of scientific inquiry.\nOn this view, claims about logical form are evaluative, and such\nclaims are underdetermined by the totality of facts concerning\nspeakers\u2019 dispositions to use language. From this perspective,\nmismatches between logical and grammatical form are to be expected,\nand we should not conclude that ordinary speakers have mental\nrepresentations that are isomorphic with sentences of a Fregean\nBegriffsschrift.\n\nAccording to Quine, speakers\u2019 behavioral dispositions constrain\nwhat can be plausibly said about how to best regiment their language.\nHe also allowed for some general constraints on interpretability that\nan idealized \u201cfield linguist\u201d might impose in coming up\nwith a regimented interpretation scheme.\n (Donald Davidson\n developed a similar line of thought in a less behavioristic idiom,\nspeaking in terms of constraints on a \u201cRadical\nInterpreter,\u201d who seeks \u201ccharitable\u201d construals of\nalien speech.) But unsurprisingly, this left ample room for\n\u201cslack\u201d with respect to which logical forms should be\nassociated with a given sentential utterance.\n\nQuine also held that decisions about how to make such associations\nshould be made holistically. As he sometimes put it, the\n\u201cunit of translation\u201d is an entire language, not a\nparticular sentence. On this view, one can translate a sentence\nS of a natural language NL with a structurally mismatching\nsentence \u00b5 of a formal language FL, even if it seems (locally)\nimplausible that S is used to express the proposition\nassociated with \u00b5, so long as the following condition is met:\nthe association between S and \u00b5 is part of a general\naccount of NL and FL that figures in an overall theory\u2014which\nincludes an account of language, logic, and the language-independent\nworld\u2014that is among the best overall theories available. This\nholistic conception of how to evaluate proposed regimentations of\nnatural language was part and parcel of Quine\u2019s criticism of the\nearly positivists\u2019\n analytic-synthetic distinction,\n and his more radical suggestion that there is no such distinction\n\nThe suggestion was that even apparently tautologous sentences, like\n\u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and \u2018Caesar died if Brutus\nkilled him\u2019, have empirical content. These may be among the last\nsentences we would dissent from, faced with recalcitrant experience;\nwe may prefer to say that Caesar didn\u2019t really die, or that\nBrutus didn\u2019t really kill him, if the next best alternative is\nto deny the conditional claim. But for Quine, every meaningful claim\nis a claim that could turn out to be false\u2014and so a claim we\nmust be prepared, at least in principle, to reject. Correlatively, no\nsentences are known to be true simply by knowing what they mean and\nknowing a priori that sentences with such meanings must be\ntrue.\n\nFor present purposes, we can abstract away from the details of debates\nabout whether Quine\u2019s overall view was plausible. Here, the\nimportant point is that claims about logical form were said to be (at\nleast partly) claims about the kind of regimented language we\nshould use, not claims about the propositions actually\nexpressed with sentences of natural language. And one aspect of\nQuine\u2019s view, about the kind of regimented language we\nshould use, turned out to be especially important for\nsubsequent discussions of logical form. For even among those who\nrejected the behavioristic assumptions that animated Quine\u2019s\nconception of language, it was often held that logical forms are\nexpressions of a first-order predicate calculus.\n\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift, recall, was designed to capture the\nDedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic, including the axiom of\ninduction; see the entry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for arithmetic.\n This required quantification into positions occupiable by predicates,\nas well as positions occupiable by names. Using modern notation, Frege\nallowed for formulae like \u2018\\((Fa \\land Fb) \\rightarrow \\exists X (Xa \\land Xb)\\)\u2019\nand \u2018\\(\\forall x \\forall y [x = y \\leftrightarrow \\forall X (Xx \\leftrightarrow Xy)]\\)\u2019.\nAnd he took second-order\nquantification to be quantification over functions. This is to say,\nfor example, that \u2018\\(\\exists X (Xa \\land Xb)\\)\u2019 is true iff:\nthere is a function, \\(X\\), that maps both the individual called\n\u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and the individual called \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 onto the\ntruth-value T. Frege also took it to be a truth of\nlogic that for any predicate \\(P\\), there is a function such that\nfor each individual \\(x\\), that function maps \\(x\\) to T iff\n\\(x\\) satisfies (or \u201cfalls under\u201d) \\(P\\). In which case,\nfor each predicate, there is the set of all and only the things that\nsatisfy the predicate. The axioms for Frege\u2019s logic thus\ngenerated\n Russell\u2019s paradox, \n\ngiven predicates like \u2018is not a member of itself\u2019. This\ninvited attempts to weaken the axioms, while preserving\nsecond-order quantification. But for various reasons, Quine and others\nadvocated a restriction to a first-order fragment of Frege\u2019s\nlogic, disallowing quantification into positions occupied by\npredicates.  (Kurt G\u00f6del had proved the\ncompleteness of first-order predicate calculus, thus providing a\npurely formal criterion for what followed from what in that\nlanguage. Quine also held that second-order quantification illicitly\ntreated predicates as names for sets, thereby spoiling Frege\u2019s\nconception of propositions as unified by virtue of having unsaturated\npredicational constituents that are satisfied by things denoted by\nnames.) On Quine\u2019s view, we should\nreplace\n\n\\[\\lsquo (Fa \\land Fb) \\rightarrow \\exists X\n(Xa \\land Xb)\\rsquo\\]\n\n with explicit first-order quantification\nover sets, as in\n\n\\[\\lsquo (Fa \\land Fb) \\rightarrow\n\\exists s (a \\in s \\land b \\in s)\\rsquo ;\\]\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(\\in\\)\u2019 stands for \u2018is an element of\u2019,\nand this second conditional is not a logical truth, but rather a\nhypothesis (to be evaluated holistically) concerning sets.\n\nThe preference for first-order regimentations has come to seem\nunwarranted, or at least highly tendentious; see Boolos (1998). But it\nfueled the idea that logical form can diverge wildly from grammatical\nform. For as students quickly learn, first-order regimentations of\nnatural sentences often turn out to be highly artificial. (And in some\ncases, such regimentations seem to be unavailable.) This was, however,\ntaken to show that natural languages are far from ideal for purposes\nof indicating logical structure.\n\nA different strand of thought in analytic philosophy\u2014pressed by\nWittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations and developed by\nothers, including\n Peter Strawson\n and\n John Austin\u2014also\n suggested that a single sentence could be used (on different\noccasions) to express different kinds of propositions. Strawson (1950)\nargued that pace Russell, a speaker could use an instance of\n\u2018The F is G\u2019 to express a singular\nproposition about a specific individual: namely, the F in the\ncontext at hand. According to Strawson, sentences themselves do not\nhave truth conditions, since sentences (as opposed to speakers) do not\nexpress propositions; and speakers can use \u2018The boy is\ntall\u2019 to express a proposition with the contextually relevant\nboy as a constituent. Donnellan (1966) went on to argue that a speaker\ncould even use an instance of \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 to express a singular proposition about an\nindividual that isn\u2019t an F; see the entry on\n reference.\n Such considerations, which have received a great deal of attention in\nrecent discussions of context dependence, suggested that relations\nbetween natural language sentences and propositions are (at best) very\ncomplex and mediated by speakers\u2019 intentions. All of which made\nit seem that such relations are far more tenuous than the pre-Fregean\ntradition suggested. This bolstered the Quine/Carnap idea that\nquestions about the structure of premises and conclusions are really\nquestions about how we should talk (when trying to describe\nthe world), much as logic itself seems to be more concerned with how\nwe should infer than with how we do infer. From this perspective, the\nconnections between logic and grammar seemed rather shallow; see\nIacona (2018) for extended discussion.\n7. Notation and Restricted Quantification\n\nOn the other hand, more recent work on quantifiers suggests that the\ndivergence had been exaggerated, in part because of how Frege\u2019s\nidea of variable-binding was originally implemented. Consider again\nthe proposition that some boy sang, and the proposed logical division\ninto the quantifier and the rest: \\(\\exists x [\\textrm{Boy}(x) \\land \\textrm{Sang}(x)]\\);\nsomething is both a boy and an individual that sang. This is one way\nto regiment the English sentence. But one can also offer a logical\nparaphrase that more closely parallels the grammatical division\nbetween \u2018some boy\u2019 and \u2018sang\u2019: for some\nindividual \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is a boy, \\(x\\) sang. One can formalize this\nparaphrase with restricted quantifiers, which incorporate a\nrestriction on the domain over which the variable in question ranges.\nFor example, \u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x)\\)\u2019 can be an existential\nquantifier that binds a variable ranging over the boys in the relevant\ndomain, with \u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x) [S(x)]\\)\u2019 being true iff some boy\nsang. Since \u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x) [S(x)]\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\exists x [B(x) \\land S(x)]\\)\u2019\nare logically equivalent, logic provides no reason\nfor preferring the latter regimentation of the English sentence. And\nchoosing the latter does not show that the proposition expressed with\n\u2018Some boy sang\u2019 has a structure that differs from\ngrammatical structure of the sentence.\n\nUniversal quantifiers can also be restricted, as in\n\u2018\\(\\forall x{:}B(x) [S(x)]\\)\u2019, interpreted as follows: for every\nindividual \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is a boy, \\(x\\) sang. Restrictors can also be\nlogically complex, as in \u2018Some boy from Canada sang\u2019 or\n\u2018Some boy who respects Mary sang\u2019, rendered as\n\u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x) \\land F(x, c)[S(x)]\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x) \\land R(x, m)[S(x)]\\)\u2019. Given these representations, the inferential\ndifference between \u2018some boy sang\u2019 and \u2018every boy\nsang\u2019 lies with the propositional contributions of\n\u2018some\u2019 and \u2018every\u2019 after all, and not partly\nwith the contribution of connectives like \u2018\\(\\land\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019.\n\nWords like \u2018someone\u2019, and the grammatical requirement that\n\u2018every\u2019 must be followed by a noun (or noun phrase),\nsuggest that natural language employs restricted quantifiers. Phrases\nlike \u2018every boy\u2019 are composed of a determiner and a noun.\nCorrespondingly, one can think of determiners as expressions that can\ncombine with an ordered pair of predicates to form a sentence, much as\none can think of transitive verbs as expressions that can combine with\nan ordered pair of names to form a sentence. And this grammatical\nanalogy, between determiners and transitive verbs, invites a semantic\ncorrelate.\n\nSince \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 are variables ranging over\nindividuals, one can say that the function indicated by the transitive\nverb \u2018likes\u2019 yields the value T given the\nordered pair \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) as argument if and only if \\(x\\) likes \\(y\\). In\nthis notational scheme, \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 corresponds to the direct\nobject (or internal argument), which combines with the verb to form a\nphrase; \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 corresponds to the grammatical subject (or\nexternal argument) of the verb. If we think about \u2018every boy\nsang\u2019 analogously, \u2018boy\u2019 is the internal argument of\n\u2018every\u2019, since \u2018every boy\u2019 is a phrase. By\ncontrast, \u2018boy\u2019 and \u2018sang\u2019 do not form a\nphrase in \u2018every boy sang\u2019. So let us introduce\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(Y\\)\u2019 as second-order variables ranging\nover functions, from individuals to truth values, stipulating that the\nextension of such a function is the set of things that the function\nmaps onto the truth value T. Then one can say that\nthe function indicated by \u2018every\u2019 yields the value\nT given the ordered pair \\(\\langle X,Y \\rangle\\) as argument\niff the extension of \\(X\\) includes the extension of \\(Y\\). Similarly, one can\nsay that the function indicated by \u2018some\u2019 maps the ordered\npair \\(\\langle X, Y \\rangle\\) onto T iff the extension of \\(X\\)\nintersects with the extension of \\(Y\\).\n\nJust as we can describe \u2018likes\u2019 as a predicate satisfied\nby ordered pairs \\(\\langle x, y \\rangle\\) such that \\(x\\) likes \\(y\\), so we can think\nabout \u2018every\u2019 as a predicate satisfied by ordered pairs\n\\(\\langle X, Y \\rangle\\) such that the extension of \\(X\\) includes the extension\nof \\(Y\\). (This is compatible with thinking about \u2018every boy\u2019\nas a restricted quantifier that combines with a predicate to form a\nsentence that is true iff every boy satisfies that predicate.) One\nvirtue of this notational scheme is that it lets us represent\nrelations between predicates that cannot be captured with\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019, and the sentential\nconnectives; see Rescher (1962), Wiggins (1980). For example, most\nboys sang iff the boys who sang outnumber the boys who did not sing.\nSo we can say that \u2018most\u2019 indicates a function that maps\n\\(\\langle X, Y \\rangle\\) to T iff the number of things that\nboth \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) map to T exceeds the number of things\nthat \\(Y\\) but not \\(X\\) maps to T.\n\nUsing restricted quantifiers, and thinking about determiners as\ndevices for indicating relations between functions, also suggests an\nalternative to Russell\u2019s treatment of \u2018the\u2019. The\nformula\n\n\\[\\lsquo \\exists x \\{B(x) \\land \\forall y\n[B(y) \\rightarrow x = y] \\land S(x)\\}\\rsquo\\]\n\n can be rewritten\nas \u2018\\(\\exists x{:}B(x)[S(x)] \\land |B| =\n1\\)\u2019, interpreted as follows: for some individual \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(x\\) is a boy, \\(x\\) sang; and the number of (relevant)\nboys is exactly one. On this view, \u2018the boy\u2019 still does\nnot correspond to a constituent of the formalism; nor does\n\u2018the\u2019. But one can depart farther from Russell\u2019s\nnotation, while emphasizing his idea that \u2018the\u2019 is\nrelevantly like \u2018some\u2019 and \u2018every\u2019. For one\ncan analyze \u2018the boy sang\u2019 as\n\u2018\\(!x:\\textrm{Boy}(x)[\\textrm{Sang}(x)]\\)\u2019, specifying the\npropositional contribution of \u2018\\(!\\)\u2019\u2014on a par with\nas \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019\u2014as\nfollows:\n\n\\[!x:Y(x)[X(x)] = \\textbf{T} \\text{ iff the extensions of } X \n\\text{ and } Y \\text{ intersect & } |Y| = 1.\\]\n\n\nThis way of encoding Russell\u2019s theory preserves his central\nclaim. While there may be a certain boy that a speaker refers to in\nsaying \u2018The boy sang\u2019, that boy is not a constituent of\nthe quantificational proposition expressed with\n\u2018\\(!x:\\textrm{Boy}(x)[\\textrm{Sang}(x)]\\)\u2019; see Neale (1990) for discussion. But\nfar from showing that the logical form of \u2018The boy sang\u2019\ndiverges dramatically from its grammatical form, the\nrestricted quantifier notation suggests that the logical form closely\nparallels the grammatical form. For \u2018the boy\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019 do correspond to constituents of\n\u2018\\(!x:B(x)[S(x)]\\)\u2019, at least if we allow for logical forms\nthat represent quantificational propositions in terms of second-order\nrelations; see Montague (1970), and for discussion of relevant\nconstraints on how such relations can be expressed with\nquantificational determiners, see Barwise and Cooper (1981),\nHigginbotham and May (1981), Keenan (1996), and the article on\n generalized quantifiers.\n\nIt is worth noting, briefly, a potential implication for inferences\nlike \u2018The boy sang, so some boy sang\u2019. If the logical form\nof \u2018The boy sang\u2019 is\n\n\\[\\lsquo\\exists x{:}B(x) [S(x)] \\land |B| = 1\\rsquo ,\\]\n\n\nthen the inference is an\ninstance of the schema \u2018\\(\\textbf{A} \\land \\textbf{B}\\), so\n\\(\\textbf{A}\\)\u2019. But if the logical form of \u2018The boy\nsang\u2019 is simply \u2018\\(!(x){:}B(x)[S(x)]\\)\u2019, the premise\nand conclusion have the same form, differing only by substitution of\n\u2018\\(!\\)\u2019 for \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019. In which case, the\nimpeccability of the inference depends on the specific contributions\nof \u2018the/\\(!\\)\u2019 and \u2018some/\\(\\exists\\)\u2019. Only\nwhen these contributions are \u201cspelled out,\u201d perhaps in\nterms of set-intersection, would the validity of the inference be\nmanifest; see, e.g., King (2002). So even if grammar and logic do not\ndiverge in this case, one might say that grammatical structure does\nnot\nreveal the logical structure. From this perspective, further\nanalysis of \u2018the\u2019 is required. Those who are skeptical of\nan analytic/synthetic distinction can say that it remains more a\ndecision than a discovery to say that \u2018Some boy sang\u2019\nfollows from \u2018The boy sang\u2019. In general, and especially\nwith regard to aspects of propositional form indicated with individual\nwords, issues about logical form are connected with issues about the\n analytic-synthetic distinction.\n8. Transformational Grammar\n\nEven given restricted quantifiers (and acceptance of second-order\nlogical forms), the subject/predicate structure of \u2018Juliet /\nlikes every doctor\u2019 diverges from the corresponding formula\nbelow.\n\n\\[\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, y)]\n\\]\n\n\nWe can rewrite \u2018\\(\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, y)\\)\u2019 as\n\u2018\\([\\textrm{Likes}(y)](\\textrm{Juliet})\\)\u2019, to reflect the\nfact that \u2018likes\u2019 combines with a direct object to form a\nphrase, which in turn combines with a subject. But this does not\naffect the main point: \u2018every\u2019 seems to be a grammatical\nconstituent of the verb phrase \u2018likes every doctor\u2019; yet\nit also seems to indicate the main quantifier of the expressed\nproposition. In natural language, \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018every\ndoctor\u2019 form a phrase. But with respect to logical form, it is\nas if \u2018likes\u2019 combines with \u2018Juliet\u2019 and a\nvariable to form a complex predicate that is in turn an external\nargument of the higher-order predicate \u2018every\u2019. Similar\nremarks apply to \u2018Some boy likes every doctor\u2019 and\n\n\\[\\lsquo[\\exists x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo.\\]\n\n\nSo it\nseems that mismatches remain in the very places that troubled medieval\nlogicians\u2014viz., quantificational direct objects and other\nexamples of complex predicates with quantificational constituents.\n\nMontague (1970, 1974) showed that these mismatches do not preclude\nsystematic connections of natural language sentences with the\ncorresponding propositional structures. Abstracting from the technical\ndetails, one can specify an algorithm that pairs each natural language\nsentence that contains one or more quantificational expressions like\n\u2018every doctor\u2019 with one or more Fregean logical forms.\nThis was a significant advance. Together with subsequent developments,\nMontague\u2019s work showed that Frege\u2019s logic was compatible\nwith the idea that quantificational constructions in natural language\nhave a systematic semantics. Indeed, one can use Frege\u2019s formal\napparatus to study such constructions. Montague maintained that the\nsyntax of natural language was, nonetheless, misleading for purposes\nof (what he took to be) real semantics. On this view, the study of\nvalid inference still suggests that grammar disguises the structure of\npropositional thought. But in thinking about the relation of logic to\ngrammar, one should not assume a naive conception of the latter.\n\nFor example, the grammatical form of a sentence need not be determined\nby the linear order of its words. Using brackets to disambiguate, we\ncan distinguish the sentence \u2018Mary [saw [the [boy [with\nbinoculars]]]]\u2019\u2014whose direct object is \u2018the boy with\nbinoculars\u2019\u2014from the homophonous sentence \u2018Mary\n[[saw [the boy]] [with binoculars]]\u2019, in which \u2018saw the\nboy\u2019 is modified by an adverbial phrase. The first implies that\nthe boy had binoculars, while the second implies that Mary used\nbinoculars to see the boy. Even if this distinction is not audibly\nmarked, there is a significant difference between modifying a noun\n(like \u2018boy\u2019) with a prepositional phrase and modifying a\nverb phrase (\u2018saw the boy\u2019). More generally, grammatical\nstructure need not be obvious. Just as it may take work to discover\nthe kind(s) of structure that propositions exhibit, so it may take\nwork to discover the kind(s) of structure that sentences exhibit. And\nmany studies of natural language suggest a rich conception of\ngrammatical form that diverges from traditional views; see especially\nChomsky (1957, 1964, 1965, 1981, 1986, 1995). So we need to ask how\nlogical forms are related to actual grammatical forms, which linguists\ntry to discover, since these may differ importantly from any\nhypothesized grammatical forms that may be suggested by casual\nreflection on spoken language. Appearances may be misleading with\nrespect to both grammatical and logical form, leaving room for the\npossibility that these notions of structure are not so different after\nall.\n\nA leading idea of modern linguistics is that at least some grammatical\nstructures are transformations of others. Put another way, linguistic\nexpressions often appear to be displaced from positions canonically\nassociated with certain grammatical relations that the expressions\nexhibit. For example, the word \u2018who\u2019 in (17) is apparently\nassociated with the internal (direct object) argument position of the\nverb \u2018saw\u2019.\n\n(17)\nMary wondered who John saw\n\n\nCorrespondingly, (17) can be glossed as \u2018Mary wondered which\nperson is such that John saw that person\u2019. This invites the\nhypothesis that (17) reflects a transformation of the \u201cDeep\nStructure\u201d (17D) into the \u201cSurface Structure\u201d (17S);\nwhere the subscripts indicate that \u2018who\u2019 bears a certain\ngrammatical relation, often called \u201cmovement,\u201d to the\ncoindexed position.\n\n(17D)\n{Mary [wondered {John [saw who]}]}\n(17S)\n{Mary [wondered [whoi {John [saw\n( \u2026 )i ]}]]}\n\n\nThe idea is that the embedded clause in (17D) has the same form as\n\u2018John saw Bill\u2019, but in (17S), \u2018who\u2019 has been\ndisplaced from its original argument position. Similar remarks apply\nto the question \u2018Who did John see\u2019 and other\nquestion-words like \u2018why\u2019, \u2018what\u2019,\n\u2018when\u2019, and \u2018how\u2019.\n\nOne might also try to explain the synonymy of (18) and (19) by\npositing a common deep structure, (18D).\n\n(18)\nJohn seems to like Mary\n(19)\nIt seems John likes Mary\n(18D)\n[Seems{John [likes Mary]}]\n(18S)\n{Johni [seems { ( _ )i [to like Mary]}]}\n\n\nIf every English sentence needs a subject of some kind, (18D) must be\nmodified: either by displacing \u2018John\u2019, as in (18S); or by\ninserting a pleonastic subject, as in (19). Note that in (19),\n\u2018It\u2019 does not indicate an argument; compare\n\u2018There\u2019 in \u2018There is something in the garden\u2019.\nAppeal to displacement also lets one distinguish the superficially\nparallel sentences (20) and (21).\n\n(20)\nJohn is easy to please\n(21)\nJohn is eager to please\n\n\nIf (20) is true, John is easily pleased. In which case, it is easy\n(for someone) to please John; and here, \u2018it\u2019 is\npleonastic. But if (21) is true, John is eager that he please someone\nor other. This asymmetry is effaced by representations like\n\u2018Easy-to-please(John)\u2019 and\n\u2018Eager-to-please(John)\u2019. The contrast is made manifest,\nhowever, with (20S) and (21S); where \u2018e\u2019 indicates an\nunpronounced argument position.\n\n(20S)\n{Johni [is easy { e [to please (\n_ )i ]}]}\n(21S)\n{Johni [is eager { ( _\n)i [to please e ]}]}\n\n\nIt may be that in (21S), which does not mean that it is eager for John\nto please someone, \u2018John\u2019 is grammatically linked to the\ncoindexed position without being displaced from that position. But\nwhatever the details, the \u201csurface subject\u201d of a sentence\ncan be the object of a verb embedded within the main predicate, as in\n(20S). Of course, such hypotheses about grammatical structure require\ndefense. But Chomsky and others have long argued that such hypotheses\nare needed to account for various facts concerning human linguistic\ncapacities; see, e.g., Berwick et.al. (2011). As an illustration of\nthe kind of data that is relevant, note that while (22\u201324) are\nperfectly fine as expressions of English, (25) is not.\n\n(22)\nThe boy who sang was happy\n(23)\nWas the boy who sang happy\n(24)\nThe boy who was happy sang\n(25)\n*Was the boy who happy sang\n\n\nThis suggests that the auxiliary verb \u2018was\u2019 can be\ndisplaced from some positions but not others. That is, while (23S) is\na permissible transformation of (22D), (25S) is not a permissible\ntransformation of (24D).\n\n(22D)\n{[The [boy [who sang]]] [was happy]}\n(23S)\nWasi {[the [boy [who sang]]] [\n( _ )i happy]}\n(24D)\n{[The [boy [who [was happy]]]] sang}\n(25S)\n*Wasi {[the [boy [who [ ( _\n)i happy]]]] sang}\n\n\nIn (25), the asterisk indicates intuitive deviance; in (25S), it\nindicates the hypothesized source of this deviance\u2014viz., that\nthe auxiliary verb cannot be displaced from the embedded relative\nclause. The ill-formedness of (25S) is striking, since one can\nsensibly ask whether or not the boy who was happy sang. One can also\nask whether or not (26) is true. But (27) is not the yes/no question\ncorresponding to (26).\n\n(26)\nThe boy who was lost kept crying\n(27)\nWas the boy who lost kept crying\n\n\nRather, (27) is the yes/no question corresponding to \u2018The boy\nwho lost was kept crying\u2019, which has an unexpected meaning. So\nwe want some account of why (27) cannot have the interpretation\ncorresponding to (26). But this \u201cnegative fact\u201d concerning\n(27) is precisely what one would expect if \u2018was\u2019 cannot be\ndisplaced from its position in (26), as in the following logically\npossible but grammatically illicit structure: *Wasi\n{[the [boy [who [( _ )i lost]]]] [kept crying]}.\n\nBy contrast, if we merely specify an algorithm that associates (27)\nwith its actual meaning\u2014or if we merely hypothesize that (27) is\nthe English translation of a certain mental sentence\u2014we have not\nyet explained why (27) cannot also be used to ask whether or not (26)\nis true. Explanations of such facts appeal to nonobvious grammatical\nstructure, and constraints on natural language transformations. (For\nexample, an auxiliary verb in a relative clause cannot be\n\u201cfronted;\u201d though of course, theorists try to find deeper\nexplanations for such constraints.)\n\nThe idea was that a sentence has both a deep structure (DS), which\nreflects semantically relevant relations between verbs and their\narguments, and a surface structure (SS) that may include displaced (or\npleonastic) elements. In some cases, pronunciation might depend on\nfurther transformations of SS, resulting in a distinct\n\u201cphonological form\u201d (PF). Linguists posited various\nconstraints on these levels of grammatical structure, and the\ntransformations that relate them. But as the theory was elaborated and\nrefined under empirical pressure, various facts that apparently called\nfor explanation in these terms still went unexplained. This suggested\nanother level of grammatical structure, obtained by a different kind\nof transformation on SS. The hypothesized level was called\n\u2018LF\u2019, intimating \u2018Logical Form\u2019; and the\nhypothesized transformation\u2014called \u2018Quantifier\nRaising\u2019 because it targeted the kinds of expressions that\nindicate (restricted) quantifiers\u2014mapped structures like (28S)\nonto structures like (28L).\n\n(28S)\n{Juliet [likes [every doctor]]}\n(28L)\n{[every doctor]i {Juliet [\nlikes ( _ )i ]}}\n\n\nClearly, (28L) does not reflect the pronounced word order in English.\nBut the idea was that PF determines pronunciation, while LF was said\nto be the level at which the scope of a natural language quantifier is\ndetermined; see May (1985). If we think about \u2018every\u2019 as a\nkind of second-order transitive predicate, which can combine with two\npredicates like \u2018doctor\u2019 and \u2018Juliet likes ( _\n)i\u2019 to form a complete sentence, we should\nexpect that at some level of analysis, the sentence \u2018Juliet\nlikes every doctor\u2019 has the structure indicated in (28L). And\nmapping (28L) to the Fregean logical\nform\n\n\\[\\lsquo [\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet},\nx)\\}\\rsquo\\]\n\n\nis trivial.  Similarly, consider the following:\n\n(29S)\n{[some boy] [likes [every doctor]]}\n(29L)\n{[some boy]i {[every\ndoctor]jj {( _ )i [likes ( _\n)j ]}}\n(29L\u2032)\n{[every doctor]j {[some\nboy]i { ( _ )i [likes ( _\n)j ]}}}\n\nIf the surface structure\n(29S) can be mapped onto either (29L) or (29L\u2032), then (29S) can\nbe easily mapped onto the Fregean logical\nforms\n\n\\[\\lsquo[\\exists x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][\\forall\ny{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\lsquo [\\forall y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y)][\\exists x{:} \\textrm{Boy}(x)]\\{\\textrm{Likes}(x,y)\\}\\rsquo .\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis assimilates quantifier scope ambiguity to the structural\nambiguity of examples like \u2018Juliet saw the boy with\nbinoculars\u2019. More generally, many apparent examples of\ngrammar/logic mismatches were rediagnosed as mismatches between\ndifferent aspects of grammatical structure\u2014between those aspects\nthat determine pronunciation, and those that determine interpretation.\nIn one sense, this is fully in keeping with the idea that in natural\nlanguage, \u201csurface appearances\u201d are often misleading with\nregard to propositional structure. But it also makes room for the idea\nthat grammatical structure and logical structure converge, in ways\nthat can be discovered through investigation, once we move beyond\ntraditional subject-predicate conceptions of structure with regard to\nboth logic and grammar.\n\nThere is independent evidence for \u201ccovert\u201d\ntransformations\u2014displacement of expressions from their audible\npositions, as in (28L); see Huang (1995), Hornstein (1995). Consider\n\u2018Jean a vu qui\u2019, which is the French translation of\n\u2018Who did John see\u2019. If we assume that \u2018qui\u2019\n(\u2018who\u2019) is displaced at LF, then we can explain why the\nquestion-word is understood in both French and English like a\nquantifier binding a variable: which person \\(x\\) is such that John saw \\(x\\)?\nSimilarly, example (30) from Chinese is transliterated as in (31).\n\n(30)\nZhangsan zhidao Lisi mai-te sheme\n(31)\nZhangsan know Lisi bought what\n\n\nBut (30) is ambiguous, between the interrogative (31a) and the complex\ndeclarative (31b).\n\n(31a)\nWhich thing is such that Zhangsan knows Lisi bought\nit\n(31b)\nZhangsan knows which thing (is such that) Lisi\nbought (it)\n\n\nThis suggests covert displacement of the quantificational\nquestion-word in Chinese; see Huang (1982, 1995). Chomsky (1981) also\nargued that the constraints on such displacement can help explain\ncontrasts like the one illustrated with (32) and (33).\n\n(32)\nWho said he has the best smile\n(33)\nWho did he say has the best smile\n\n\nIn (32), the pronoun \u2018he\u2019 can have a bound-variable\nreading: which person \\(x\\) is such that \\(x\\) said that \\(x\\) has the best smile.\nThis suggests that the following grammatical structure is possible:\nWhoi {[( )i said\n[hei has the best smile]]}. But (33) cannot be used\nto ask this question, suggesting that some linguistic constraint rules\nout the following logically possible structure:\n*Whoi [did {[hei say [(\n)i has the best smile]]]. And there cannot be\nconstraints on transformations without transformations. So if English\novertly displaces question-words that are covertly displaced in other\nlanguages, we should not be too surprised if English covertly\ndisplaces other quantificational expressions like \u2018every\ndoctor\u2019. Likewise, (34) has the reading indicated in (34a) but\nnot the reading indicated in (34b).\n\n(34)\nIt is false that Juliet likes every doctor\n(34a)\n\\(\\neg \\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x) [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, x)]\\)\n(34b)\n\\(\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(x) \\neg [\\textrm{Likes}(\\textrm{Juliet}, x)]\\)\n\n\nThis suggests that \u2018every doctor\u2019 gets displaced, but only\nso far. Similarly, (13) cannot mean that every doctor is such that no\npatient who saw that doctor is healthy.\n\n(13)\nNo patient who saw every doctor is healthy\n\n\nAs we have already seen, English seems to abhor fronting certain\nelements from within an embedded relative clause. This invites the\nhypothesis that Quantifier Raising is subject to a similar constraint,\nand hence, that many quantificational expressions get displaced in\nEnglish. This hypothesis is not uncontroversial; see, e.g., Jacobson\n(1999). But many linguists (following Chomsky [1995, 2000]) would now\nposit only two levels of grammatical structure, corresponding to PF\nand LF\u2014the thought being that constraints on DS and SS can be\neschewed in favor of a simpler theory that only posits constraints on\nhow expressions can be combined in the course of constructing complex\nexpressions that can be pronounced and interpreted. If this\ndevelopment of earlier theories proves correct, then the only\nsemantically relevant level of grammatical structure often reflects\ncovert displacement of audible expressions; see, e.g., Hornstein\n(1995). In any case, there is a large body of work suggesting that\nmany logical properties of quantifiers, names, and pronouns are\nreflected in properties of LF.\n\nFor example, if (35) is true, it follows that some doctor treated some\ndoctor; whereas (36) does not have this consequence:\n\n(35)\nEvery boy saw the doctor who treated himself\n(36)\nEvery boy saw the doctor who treated him\n\n\nThe meanings of (35) and (36) seem to be roughly as indicated in (35a)\nand (36a); where \u2018\\(!\\)\u2019 indicates the contribution of\n\u2018the\u2019.\n\n(35a)\n\\([\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][!y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) \\land \\textrm{Treated}(y,y)] \\{\\textrm{Saw}(x,y)\\}\\)\n(36a)\n\\([\\forall x{:}\\textrm{Boy}(x)][!y{:}\\textrm{Doctor}(y) \\land \\textrm{Treated}(y,x)] \\{\\textrm{Saw}(x,y)\\}\\)\n\n\nThis suggests that \u2018himself\u2019 is behaving like a variable\nbound by \u2018the doctor\u2019, while \u2018every boy\u2019 can\nbind \u2018him\u2019. And there are independent grammatical reasons\nfor saying that \u2018himself\u2019 must be linked to \u2018the\ndoctor\u2019, while \u2018him\u2019 must not be so linked. Note\nthat in \u2018Pat thinks Chris treated himself/him\u2019, the\nantecedent of \u2018himself\u2019 must be the subject of\n\u2018treated\u2019, while the antecedent of \u2018him\u2019 must\nnot be; see Chomsky (1981).\n\nWe still need to enforce the conceptual distinction between LF and the\ntraditional notion of logical form. There is no guarantee that\nstructural features of natural language sentences will mirror the\nlogical features of propositions; cp. Stanley (2000), King (2007). But\nthis leaves room for the empirical hypothesis that LF reflects at\nleast a great deal of propositional structure; see Harman (1972),\nHigginbotham (1986), Segal (1989), Larson and Ludlow (1993), and the\nessay on\n structured propositions.\n Moreover, even if the LF of a sentence S underdetermines the logical\nform of the proposition a speaker expresses with S (on a given\noccasion of use), the LF may provide a \u201cscaffolding\u201d that\ncan be elaborated in particular contexts, with little or no mismatch\nbetween grammatical and propositional architecture. If some such view\nis correct, it might avoid certain (unpleasant) questions prompted by\nearlier Fregean views: how can a sentence be used to express a\nproposition with a radically different structure; and if grammar is\ndeeply misleading, why think that our intuitions concerning\nimpeccability provide reliable evidence about which propositions\nfollow from which? These are, however, issues that remain\nunsettled.\n9. Semantic Structure and Events\n\nIf propositions are the \u201cthings\u201d that really have logical\nform, and sentences of English are not themselves propositions, then\nsentences of English \u201chave\u201d logical forms only by\nassociation with propositions. But if the meaning of a sentence is\nsome proposition\u2014or perhaps a function from contexts to\npropositions\u2014then one might say that the logical form\n\u201cof\u201d a sentence is its semantic structure (i.e., the\nstructure of that sentence\u2019s meaning). Alternatively, one might\nsuspect that in the end, talk of propositions is just convenient\nshorthand for talking about the semantic properties of certain\nsentences: perhaps sentences of a Begriffsschrift, or sentences of\nmentalese, or sentences of natural languages (abstracting away from\ntheir logically/semantically irrelevant properties). In any case, the\nnotion of logical form has played a significant role in recent work on\ntheories of meaning for natural languages. So an introductory\ndiscussion of logical form would not be complete without some hint of\nwhy such work is relevant, especially since attending to details of\nnatural languages (as opposed to languages invented to study the\nfoundations of arithmetic) led to renewed discussion of how to\nrepresent propositions that involve relations.\n\nPrima facie, \u2018Every old patient respects some doctor\u2019 and\n\u2018Some young politician likes every liar\u2019 exhibit common\nmodes of linguistic combination. So a natural hypothesis is that the\nmeaning of each sentence is fixed by these modes of combination, given\nthe relevant word meanings. It may be hard to see how this hypothesis\ncould be true if there are widespread mismatches between logical and\ngrammatical form. But it is also hard to see how the hypothesis could\nbe false. Children, who have finite cognitive resources, typically\nacquire the capacity to understand the endlessly many expressions of\nthe languages spoken around them. A great deal of recent work has\nfocussed on these issues, concerning the connections between logical\nform and the senses in which natural languages are semantically\n compositional.\n\nIt was implicit in Frege that each of the endlessly many sentences of\nan ideal language would have a compositionally determined\ntruth-condition. Frege did not actually specify an algorithm that\nwould associate each sentence of his Begriffsschrift with its\ntruth-condition. But\n Tarski (1933) showed how to do this for the\n first-order predicate calculus, focussing on interesting cases of\n multiple quantification like the one shown below:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\forall x &[\\textrm{Number}(x) \\:\\rightarrow \\\\\n & \\exists y [\\textrm{SuccessorOf}(y, x) \n \\land \\forall z [\\textrm{SuccessorOf}(z, x) \\rightarrow z =  y]]]\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis made it possible to capture, with precision, the idea that an\ninference is valid in the predicate calculus iff: every interpretation\nthat makes the premises true also makes the conclusion true, holding\nfixed the interpretations of logical elements like \u2018if\u2019\nand \u2018every\u2019. Davidson (1967a) conjectured that one could\ndo for English what Tarski did for the predicate calculus; and\nMontague, similarly inspired by Tarski, showed how one could start\ndealing with predicates that have quantificational\nconstituents. Still, many apparent objections to the conjecture\nremained. As noted at the end of\n section four,\n sentences like \u2018Pat thinks that Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019\npresent difficulties; though Davidson (1968) offered an influential\nsuggestion. Davidson\u2019s (1967b) proposal concerning examples like\n(37\u201340) also proved enormously fruitful.\n\n(37)\nJuliet kissed Romeo quickly at midnight.\n(38)\nJuliet kissed Romeo quickly.\n(39)\nJuliet kissed Romeo at midnight.\n(40)\nJuliet kissed Romeo.\n\n\nIf (37) is true, so are (38\u201340); and if (38) or (39) is true, so\nis (40). The inferences seem impeccable. But the function-argument\nstructures are not obvious. If we represent \u2018kissed quickly at\nmidnight\u2019 as an unstructured predicate that takes two arguments,\nlike \u2018kissed\u2019 or \u2018kicked\u2019, we will represent\nthe inference from (37) to (40) as having the form: \\(K^*(x, y)\\); so \\(K(x, y)\\).\nBut this form is exemplified by the bad inference \u2018Juliet\nkicked Romeo; so Juliet kissed Romeo\u2019. Put another way, if\n\u2018kissed quickly at midnight\u2019 is a logically unstructured\nbinary predicate, then the following conditional is a nonlogical\nassumption: if Juliet kissed Romeo in a certain manner at a certain\ntime, then Juliet kissed Romeo. But this conditional seems like a\ntautology, not an assumption that introduces any epistemic risk.\nDavidson concluded that the surface appearances of sentences like\n(37\u201340) mask relevant semantic structure. In particular, he\nproposed that such sentences are understood in terms of quantification\nover events.\n\nAccording to Davidson, who echoed Ramsey (1927), the meaning of (40)\nis reflected in the paraphrase \u2018There was a kissing of Romeo by\nJuliet\u2019. One can formalize this proposal in various ways, with\ndifferent implications for how verbs like \u2018kiss\u2019 are\nrelated to propositional constituents: \\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Past}(e)\n\\land \\textrm{KissingOf}(e, \\textrm{Romeo}) \\land\n\\textrm{KissingBy}(e, \\textrm{Juliet})]\\); or \\(\\exists e\n[\\textrm{Past}(e) \\land \\textrm{KissingByOf}(e, \\textrm{Juliet},\n\\textrm{Romeo})]\\); or as in (40a), with Juliet and Romeo explicitly\nrepresented as players of certain roles in an event.\n\n(40a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})]\\)\n\n\nBut given any such representation, adverbs like \u2018quickly\u2019\nand \u2018at midnight\u2019 can be analyzed as additional predicates\nof events, as shown in (37a\u201339a).\n\n(37a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{Quick}(e) \\land \\textrm{At-midnight}(e)]\\)\n(38a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{Quick}(e)]\\)\n(39a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{At-midnight}(e)]\\)\n\n\nIf this is correct, then the inference from (37) to (40) is an\ninstance of the following valid form: \\(\\exists e [\\ldots e \\ldots\n\\land Q(e) \\land A(e)]\\); hence, \\(\\exists e [\\dots e \\dots]\\). The\nother impeccable inferences involving (37\u201340) can likewise be\nviewed as instances of conjunction reduction in the scope of an\nexistential quantifier; see Pietroski (2018) for discussion that\nconnects this point to medieval insights noted in\n section three.\n If the grammatical form of (40) is simply \u2018{Juliet [kissed\nRomeo]}\u2019, then the mapping from grammatical to logical form is\nnot transparent; and natural language is misleading, in that no word\ncorresponds to the event quantifier. But this does not posit a\nsignificant structural mismatch between grammatical and logical form.\nOn the contrary, each word in (40) corresponds to a conjunct in (40a).\nThis suggests a strategy for thinking about how the meaning of a\nsentence like (40) might be composed from the meanings of the\nconstituent words. A growing body of literature, in philosophy and\nlinguistics, suggests that Davidson\u2019s proposal captures an\nimportant feature of natural language semantics, and that \u201cevent\nanalyses\u201d provide a useful framework for discussions of logical\nform; see, e.g., Schein (2017) for extended discussion and many\nreferences.\n\nIn one sense, it is an ancient idea that action reports like (40)\nrepresent individuals as participating in events; see Gillon\u2019s\n(2007) discussion of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar of Sanskrit.\nBut if (40) can be glossed as \u2018Juliet did some kissing, and\nRomeo was thereby kissed\u2019, perhaps the ancient idea can be\ndeployed in developing Leibniz\u2019 suggestion that relational\nsentences like (40) somehow contain simpler active-voice and\npassive-voice sentences; cp. Kratzer (1996). And perhaps appeals to\nquantifier raising can help in defending the idea that \u2018Juliet\nkissed some/the/every boy\u2019 is, after all, a sentence\nthat exhibits Subject-copula-Predicate form:\n\u2018[some/the/every boy]i is\nP\u2019, with \u2018P\u2019 as a complex\npredicate akin to \u2018[some event]e was both a\nkissing done by Juliet and one in which hei was\nkissed\u2019.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s return to the idea that each complex\nexpression of natural language has semantic properties that are\ndetermined by (i) the semantic properties of its constituents, and\n(ii) the ways in which these constituents are grammatically arranged.\nIf this is correct, then following Davidson, one might say that the\nlogical forms of expressions (of some natural language) just are the\nstructures that determine the corresponding meanings given the\nrelevant word meanings; see Lepore and Ludwig (2002). In which case,\nthe phenomenon of valid inference may be largely a by-product of\nsemantic compositionality. If principles governing the meanings of\n(37\u201340) have the consequence that (40) is true iff an\nexistential claim like (40a) is true, perhaps this is illustrative of\nthe general case. Given a sentence of some natural language NL, the\ntask of specifying its logical form may be inseparable from the task\nof providing a compositional specification of what the sentences of NL\nmean.\n10. Further Questions\n\nAt this point, many issues become relevant to further discussions of\nlogical form. Most obviously, there are questions concerning\nparticular examples. Given just about any sentence of natural\nlanguage, one can ask interesting questions (that remain unsettled)\nabout its logical form. There are also very abstract questions about\nthe relation of semantics to logic. Should we follow Davidson and\nMontague, among others, in characterizing theories of meaning for\nnatural languages as theories of truth (that perhaps satisfy certain\nconditions on learnability)? Is an algorithm that correctly associates\nsentences with truth-conditions (relative to contexts) necessary\nand/or sufficient for being an adequate theory of meaning? What should\nwe say about the paradoxes apparently engendered by sentences like\n\u2018This sentence is false\u2019? If we allow for second-order\nlogical forms, how should we understand second-order quantification,\ngiven Russell\u2019s Paradox? Are claims about the \u201csemantic\nstructure\u201d of a sentence fundamentally descriptive claims about\nspeakers (or their communities, or their languages)? Or is there an\nimportant sense in which claims about semantic structure are normative\nclaims about how we should use language? Are facts about the\nacquisition of language germane to hypotheses about logical form? And\nof course, the history of the subject reveals that the answers to the\ncentral questions are by no means obvious: what is logical structure,\nwhat is grammatical structure, and how are they related? Or put\nanother way, what kinds of structures do propositions and sentences\nexhibit, and how do thinkers/speakers relate them?",
