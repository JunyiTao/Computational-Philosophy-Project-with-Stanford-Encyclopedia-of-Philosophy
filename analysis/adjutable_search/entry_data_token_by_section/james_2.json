    "main_text": "The Principles of Psychology\n3. The Principles of Psychology\n\nIn 1878, James agreed to write a psychology textbook for the American\npublisher Henry Holt, but it took him twelve years to produce the\nmanuscript, and when he did he described it to Holt as \u201ca\nloathsome, distended, tumefied, bloated, dropsical mass, testifying to\nnothing but two facts: 1st, that there is no such thing as a\nscience of psychology, and 2nd, that W. J. is an\nincapable\u201d (The Letters of William James, ed. Henry\nJames. (Boston: Little, Brown, 1926, pp. 393\u20134). Nevertheless,\nthis thousand page volume of psychology, physiology and philosophy has\nproved to be James\u2019s masterwork, containing early statements of\nhis main philosophical ideas in extraordinarily rich chapters on\n\u201cThe Stream of Thought,\u201d \u201cThe Consciousness of\nSelf,\u201d \u201cEmotion,\u201d \u201cWill,\u201d and many other\ntopics.\n\nJames tells us that he will follow the psychological method of\nintrospection in The Principles, which he defines as\n\u201cthe looking into our own minds and reporting what we there\ndiscover\u201d (PP 185). In fact he takes a number of methodological\napproaches in the book. Early on, he includes chapters on \u201cThe\nFunctions of the Brain\u201d and \u201cOn Some General Conditions of\nBrain Activity\u201d that reflect his years as a lecturer in anatomy\nand physiology at Harvard, and he argues for the reductive and\nmaterialist thesis that habit is \u201cat bottom a physical\nprinciple\u201d (PP 110). As the book moves along, he involves\nhimself in discussions with philosophers\u2014for example with Hume\nand Kant in his hundred-page chapter on the self, and he finds himself\nmaking metaphysical claims that anticipate his later pragmatism, as\nwhen he writes: \u201cThere is no property ABSOLUTELY essential\nto any one thing. The same property which figures as the essence\nof a thing on one occasion becomes a very inessential feature on the\nother\u201d (PP 959).\n\nEven \u201cintrospection\u201d covers a range of reports. James\ndiscusses the experiments that his contemporaries Wundt, Stumpf and\nFechner were performing in their laboratories, which led them to\nresults such as that \u201csounds are less delicately discriminated\nin intensity than lights\u201d (PP 513).  But many of\nJames\u2019s most important and memorable introspective observations\ncome from his own life. For example:\n\nThe rhythm of a lost word may be there without a sound to clothe\nit\u2026. Everyone must know the tantalizing effect of the blank\nrhythm of some forgotten verse, restlessly dancing in one\u2019s\nmind, striving to be filled out with words (PP 244).\n\n\nOur father and mother, our wife and babes, are bone of our bone and\nflesh of our flesh. When they die, a part of our very selves is gone.\nIf they do anything wrong, it is our shame. If they are insulted, our\nanger flashes forth as readily as if we stood in their place. (PP\n280).\n\nThere is an excitement during the crying fit which is not without a\ncertain pungent pleasure of its own; but it would take a genius for\nfelicity to discover any dash of redeeming quality in the feeling of\ndry and shrunken sorrow (PP 1061).\n\n\u201cWill you or won\u2019t you have it so?\u201d is the\nmost probing question we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour of\nthe day, and about the largest as well as the smallest, the most\ntheoretical as well as the most practical, things. We answer by\nconsents or non-consents and not by words. What wonder that\nthese dumb responses should seem our deepest organs of communication\nwith the nature of things! (PP, p. 1182). \n\n\nIn this last quotation, James tackles a philosophical problem from a\npsychological perspective. Although he refrains from answering the\nquestion of whether these \u201cresponses\u201d are in fact deep\norgans of communication with the nature of things\u2014reporting only\nthat they seem to us to be so\u2014in his later writings, such as\nVarieties of Religious Experience and A Pluralistic\nUniverse, he confesses, and to some degree defends, his belief\nthat the question should be answered affirmatively. \n\nIn the deservedly famous chapter on \u201cThe Stream of\nThought\u201d James takes himself to be offering a richer account of\nexperience than those of traditional empiricists such as Hume. He\nbelieves relations, vague fringes, and tendencies are experienced\ndirectly (a view he would later defend as part of his \u201cradical\nempiricism.\u201d) James finds consciousness to be a stream rather\nthan a succession of \u201cideas.\u201d Its waters blend, and our\nindividual consciousness\u2014or, as he prefers to call it sometimes,\nour \u201csciousness\u201d\u2014is \u201csteeped and dyed\u201d\nin the waters of sciousness or thought that surround it. Our psychic\nlife has rhythm: it is a series of transitions and resting-places, of\n\u201cflights and perchings\u201d (PP 236). We rest when we remember\nthe name we have been searching for; and we are off again when we hear\na noise that might be the baby waking from her nap.\n\nInterest\u2014and its close relative, attention\u2014is a major\ncomponent not only of James\u2019s psychology, but of the\nepistemology and metaphysics that seep into his discussion. A thing,\nJames states in \u201cThe Stream of Thought,\u201d is a group of\nqualities \u201cwhich happen practically or aesthetically to interest\nus, to which we therefore give substantive names\u2026\u201d. (PP\n274). And reality \u201cmeans simply relation to our emotional\nand active life\u2026whatever excites and stimulates our interest is\nreal\u201d (PP 924). Our capacity for attention to one thing\nrather than another is for James the sign of an \u201cactive\nelement in all consciousness,\u2026a spiritual\nsomething\u2026which seems to go out to meet these qualities and\ncontents, whilst they seem to come in to be received by it.\u201d (PP\n285). Faced with the tension between scientific determinism and our\nbelief in our own freedom or autonomy, James\u2014speaking not as a\npsychologist but as the philosopher he had become\u2014argues that\nscience \u201cmust be constantly reminded that her purposes are not\nthe only purposes, and that the order of uniform causation which she\nhas use for, and is therefore right in postulating, may be enveloped\nin a wider order, on which she has no claims at all\u201d (PP\n1179).\n\nIn his discussions of consciousness James appears at various times to\nbe a reductive materialist, a dualist, a proto-phenomenologist, and a\nneutral psychologist who wouldn\u2019t dare to consider philosophical\nquestions. One of the most original layers of The Principles\nlies in James\u2019s pursuit of a \u201cpure\u201d description of\nthe stream of thought that does not presuppose it to be either mental\nor material, a pursuit that anticipates not only his own later\n\u201cradical empiricism,\u201d but Husserl\u2019s phenomenology.\nIn his chapter on \u201cSensation,\u201d for example, James is at\npains to deny that sensations are \u201cin the mind\u201d and then\n\u201cby a special act on our part \u2018extradited\u2019 or\n\u2018projected\u2019 so as to appear located in an outer\nworld\u201d (PP 678). He argues that our original experiences are\nobjective, that \u201conly as reflection becomes developed do we\nbecome aware of an inner world at all\u201d (PP 679). However, the\nobjective world originally experienced is not the world of spatial\nrelations that we think: \n\nCertainly a child newly born in Boston, who gets a sensation from the\ncandle-flame which lights the bedroom, or from his diaper-pin [who]\ndoes not feel either of these objects to be situated in longitude 71\nW. and latitude 42 N.\u2026.The flame fills its own place, the pain\nfills its own place; but as yet these places are neither identified\nwith, nor discriminated from, any other places. That comes\nlater.  For the places thus first sensibly known are elements of\nthe child\u2019s space-world which remain with him all his life. (PP\n681\u20132)\n\n\nJames\u2019s chapter on \u201cHabit,\u201d early in the book,\nbegins with habit as a physical matter but ends by considering its\nethical implications. James argues that the laws of nature are\nthemselves habits, \u201cnothing but the immutable habits which the\ndifferent elementary sorts of matter follow in their actions and\nreactions upon each other\u201d (PP 109). In our brains, habits are\npaths of nervous energy, as rivers and streams are the paths of\nwater\u2019s flow. At skin level, even a scar is a kind of habit,\n\u201cmore likely to be abraded, inflamed, to suffer pain and cold,\nthan are the neighboring parts\u201d (PP 111). On the psychological\nlevel as well, \u201cany sequence of mental action which has been\nfrequently repeated, tends to perpetuate itself ...\u201d (PP 116).\nHabits are useful in diminishing the attention that we have to devote\nto our actions, thereby allowing us to develop \u201cour higher\npowers of mind\u201d (PP 126). On the social level, habit is\n\u201cthe enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious\nconservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of\nordinance, and saves the children of fortune from the envious\nuprisings of the poor\u201d (PP 125). The \u201cethical implications\nof the law of habit,\u201d (PP 124) as James sees them, concern which\nhabits we choose to develop, and when. Many habits must begin early in\nlife: \u201cHardly ever is a language learned after twenty spoken\nwithout a foreign accent\u201d (PP 126). We should strive to make our\n\u201cnervous system our ally instead of our enemy\u201d by forming\nas many good habits as we can, as early in life as we can. Even later\nin life, we are to keep our capacity for resolution in shape by every\nday or two doing \u201csomething for no other reason than that you\nwould rather not do it\u201d (PP 130).\n\nTwo noteworthy chapters late in The Principles are \u201cThe\nEmotions\u201d and \u201cWill.\u201d The first sets out the\ntheory\u2014also enunciated by the Danish physiologist Carl\nLange\u2014that emotion follows, rather than causes, its bodily\nexpression: \u201cCommon-sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry\nand weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a\nrival, are angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended says\nthat this order of sequence is incorrect\u2026that we feel sorry\nbecause we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we\ntremble\u2026\u201d (PP 1065\u20136). The significance of this\nview, according to James, is that our emotions are tied in with our\nbodily expressions. What, he asks, would grief be \u201cwithout its\ntears, its sobs, its suffocation of the heart, its pang in the\nbreast-bone?\u201d Not an emotion, James answers, for a \u201cpurely\ndisembodied human emotion is a nonentity\u201d (PP 1068).\n\nIn his chapter on \u201cWill\u201d James opposes the theory of his\ncontemporary Wilhelm Wundt that there is one special feeling\u2014a\n\u201cfeeling of innervation\u201d\u2014present in all intentional\naction.  In his survey of a range of cases, James finds that some\nactions involve an act of resolve or of outgoing nervous energy, but\nothers do not. For example:\n\nI sit at table after dinner and find myself from time to time taking\nnuts or raisins out of the dish and eating them. My dinner properly is\nover, and in the heat of the conversation I am hardly aware of what I\ndo; but the perception of the fruit, and the fleeting notion that I\nmay eat it, seem fatally to bring the act about. There is certainly no\nexpress fiat here;\u2026 (PP 1131).\n\n\nThe chapter on \u201cWill\u201d also contains striking passages that\nanticipate the concerns of The Varieties of Religious\nExperience:  about moods, \u201cchanges of heart,\u201d\nand \u201cawakenings of conscience.\u201d  These, James\nobserves, may affect the \u201cwhole scale of values of our motives\nand impulses\u201d (PP 1140). \n",
