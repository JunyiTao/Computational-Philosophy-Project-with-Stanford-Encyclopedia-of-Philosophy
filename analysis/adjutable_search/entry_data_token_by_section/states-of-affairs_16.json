    "main_text": "The Unity of a State of Affairs || Internal Unification\n6.3 Internal Unification\n\nThis brings us to Internal Theories that explain the unity of a state\nof affairs merely by appealing to its constituents.\n\nThe state of affairs a\u2019s being F exists\nif, and only if, a or being F or both unify the\nstate of affairs.\n\nRamsey describes (but does not endorse) the core of this view when he\nsays:\n\n\n[I]n every atomic fact there must be one constituent which is in its\nown nature incomplete or connective and, as it were, holds the other\nconstituents together. (Ramsey 1925: 408)\n\n\nFor Wittgenstein in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus there\nis no designated connector in a state of affairs. All constituents are\nincomplete and mutually complete each other:\n\n\nIn a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the links in a\nchain. (Wittgenstein 1918: 2.03; Pears/McGuinness translation)\n\n\nSo far we have only been given a necessary condition for the existence\nof a state of affairs. Among the things that enter into a state of\naffairs there must be at least one incomplete one. Wittgenstein will\nrequire incompleteness or connectivity of all things that enter a\nstate of affairs.\n\nThe notion of incompleteness at work here is difficult to explain. But\none way to develop it is to propose that the incomplete and connecting\nelements are functions. For example, the property being\nF is conceived of as a function that takes a particular\na as argument and maps it to the state of affairs\na\u2019s being F (see Oliver 1992: 91). The\nproblems of the functional model of states of affairs are manifest in\nthe development of Frege\u2019s work. Frege 1879 held that sentences\nstand for what he called \u201cjudgeable contents\u201d, complexes\ncomposed of functions and objects. For Frege predication is the\napplication of a function to an object. Judgeable contents seem to be\nnothing other than states of affairs. However, the idea that states of\naffairs are complex does not sit happily with Frege\u2019s further\nidea that the judgeable content a\u2019s being\nF is the value of the function F for a as\nargument.\n\nNow different functions have the same value for different arguments.\nFor example, 3 is the value of the function Square root of\nx for 9 and the value of the function \\(x+1\\) for 2. Which\nof these arguments and functions is contained in the value 3? Since\nthere is no principle that singles out one argument and function as\nconstituting the value, we should abandon either the functional model\nof incompleteness or the idea that states of affairs have\nconstituents. Later Frege takes the second option:\n\n\nThe references of the parts of a sentence are not parts of the\nreference of the sentence. (Frege 1910\u201314: 87)\n\n\nSince different functions can have the same value for different\narguments, Frege arrived at the view that a sentence that is either\ntrue or false refers to its truth-value, the True or the False. Every\ntrue (false) sentence has the same referent: the True (the False).\nStates of affairs have no place in the Fregean theory of reference.\nThe \u201ccase study\u201d of Frege shows that the functional model\nof incompleteness undermines the very idea that states of affairs are\ncomplexes (for a reply to this argument see Gaskin 2008: 100).\n\nThe strategy to explain the unity of a state of affairs by using the\nnotion of incompleteness either only labels the problem or, if\nincomplete elements are taken to be functions, threatens the very idea\nof states of affairs. Can one dispense with the notion of\nincompleteness in an answer to the unity-question?\n\nThe unity-question arises on a conception that takes states of affairs\nto be ontologically dependent entities. Take the state of affairs\nAristotle\u2019s being wise. It ontologically depends on\nAristotle and being wise. So do the ordered pair\n\\(\\langle\\)Aristotle, being wise\\(\\rangle\\) and the\nmereological sum of Aristotle and being wise. What\ndistinguishes them? If we follow Fine, the answer will invoke an\noperation that \u201cgenerates\u201d the entities in question.\nStates of affairs are generated by predication, ordered pairs by\nanother operation.\n\nNow saying that something is predicated of something else sounds as if\nthe existence of a state of affairs depends on performing an act. But\nthis is a misunderstanding. Johnston explains:\n\n\n[P]redicability guarantees predication. Whenever F-ness is\npredicable of a, there will be something that is the\npredication of F-ness to a. (Johnston 2006: 684)\n\n\nAll the interesting work is done by the notion of predicability:\n\nThe state of affairs a\u2019s being F exists\nif, and only if, being F is predicable of\na.\n\nWhen a property (relation) is predicable of some objects will be\ndetermined by a number of principles (or axioms) (Johnston 2006: 685).\nFor example, particulars are not predicable of other particulars,\nn-place properties are only predicable of n particulars.\nIt is part of the nature of the objects and properties on which a\nstate of affairs ontologically depends that the properties are\npredicable of the objects. This brings us to a key thought of\nWittgenstein\u2019s theory of states of affairs. He wrote in the\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus:\n\n\n2.0123\n If I know an object I also know all its possible occurrences in\nstates of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of\nthe nature of the object.) \n2.0214\n If all objects are given, then at the same time all possible\nstates of affairs are also given. \n\n\n\nThe nature of particulars and properties determines whether the second\nare predicable of the first or not. Wetzel (1998: 57) fills this\nsuggestion out in an informative way. An object may be in a range of\npossible states due to its capacities. Given that the computer I am\nwriting on belongs to a particular kind there is a range of\npossibilities for it to be: it might be broken, functioning well, be\nturned off etc. Its capacities and, broadly speaking, its nature is\nthe \u201contological ground of ranges of possible states of affairs\nin which [it is a constituent]\u201d (1998: 57). One should add that\nthe nature and capacities of an object also determine a range of\nimpossibilities such as the impossibility of my computer\u2019s\nbecoming a sentient being.\n\nHowever, consider my computer\u2019s being to the left of my lamp.\nThis is a possibility for my computer, but it is a brute possibility\nnot grounded in its causal powers. Hence, the range of states of\naffairs which contain a particular seems to be broader than the range\nof states of affairs determined by its capacities.\n\nIf the property being F is predicable of the object\na, the state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF exists. Hence, states of affairs exist in virtue of the\nnature of objects and properties. No unifying relation or operation in\naddition to a and being F is required. What\ndistinguishes states of affairs from other entities which\nontologically depend on the same properties and particulars is that\nstates of affairs exist because the properties are predicable of the\nparticulars.\n\nThis account assumes that if being F is predicable of\na, there is a state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF that ontologically depends on them. This move carries\nthe problem posed by states of affairs to the right place: what are\nthe restrictions on predicability? If one has answered this question,\none has solved the unity problem for states of affairs.\n",
