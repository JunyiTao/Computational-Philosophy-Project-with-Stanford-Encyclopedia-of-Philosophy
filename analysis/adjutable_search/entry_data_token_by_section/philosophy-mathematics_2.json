    "main_text": "Four schools || Logicism\n2.1 Logicism\n\nThe logicist project consists in attempting to reduce mathematics to\nlogic. Since logic is supposed to be neutral about matters\nontological, this project seemed to harmonize with the\nanti-platonistic atmosphere of the time.\n\nThe idea that mathematics is logic in disguise goes back to Leibniz.\nBut an earnest attempt to carry out the logicist program in detail\ncould be made only when in the nineteenth century the basic principles\nof central mathematical theories were articulated (by Dedekind and\nPeano) and the principles of logic were uncovered (by Frege).\n\nFrege devoted much of his career to trying to show how mathematics can\nbe reduced to logic (Frege 1884). He managed to derive the principles\nof (second-order) Peano arithmetic from the basic laws of a system of\nsecond-order logic. His derivation was flawless. However, he relied on\none principle which turned out not to be a logical principle after\nall. Even worse, it is untenable. The principle in question is\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law V: \n\n\\[ \\{x|Fx\\}=\\{x|Gx\\} \\text{ if and only if } \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx), \\]\n\n\nIn words: the set of the Fs is identical with the\nset of the Gs iff the Fs are\nprecisely the Gs.\n\nIn a famous letter to Frege, Russell showed that Frege\u2019s Basic\nLaw V entails a contradiction (Russell 1902). This argument has come\nto be known as Russell\u2019s paradox (see\n section 2.4).\n\nRussell himself then tried to reduce mathematics to logic in another\nway. Frege\u2019s Basic Law V entails that corresponding to every\nproperty of mathematical entities, there exists a class of\nmathematical entities having that property. This was evidently too\nstrong, for it was exactly this consequence which led to\nRussell\u2019s paradox. So Russell postulated that only properties of\nmathematical objects that have already been shown to exist, determine\nclasses. Predicates that implicitly refer to the class that they were\nto determine if such a class existed, do not determine a class. Thus a\ntyped structure of properties is obtained: properties of ground\nobjects, properties of ground objects and classes of ground objects,\nand so on. This typed structure of properties determines a layered\nuniverse of mathematical objects, starting from ground objects,\nproceeding to classes of ground objects, then to classes of ground\nobjects and classes of ground objects, and so on.\n\nUnfortunately, Russell found that the principles of his typed logic\ndid not suffice for deducing even the basic laws of arithmetic. He\nneeded, among other things, to lay down as a basic principle that\nthere exists an infinite collection of ground objects. This could\nhardly be regarded as a logical principle. Thus the second attempt to\nreduce mathematics to logic also faltered.\n\nAnd there matters stood for more than fifty years. In 1983, Crispin\nWright\u2019s book on Frege\u2019s theory of the natural numbers\nappeared (Wright 1983). In it, Wright breathes new life into the\nlogicist project. He observes that Frege\u2019s derivation of\nsecond-order Peano Arithmetic can be broken down in two stages. In a\nfirst stage, Frege uses the inconsistent Basic Law V to derive what\nhas come to be known as Hume\u2019s Principle:\n\nThe number of the Fs = the number of the Gs\nif and only if \\(F\\approx G\\),\n\nwhere \\(F \\approx G\\) means that the Fs and the Gs\nstand in one-to-one correspondence with each other.\n(This relation of one-to-one correspondence can be expressed in\nsecond-order logic.) Then, in a second stage, the principles of\nsecond-order Peano Arithmetic are derived from Hume\u2019s Principle\nand the accepted principles of second-order logic. In particular,\nBasic Law V is not needed in the second part of the\nderivation. Moreover, Wright conjectured that in contrast to\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law V, Hume\u2019s Principle is consistent.\nGeorge Boolos and others observed that Hume\u2019s Principle is\nindeed consistent (Boolos 1987).\n\nWright went on to claim that Hume\u2019s Principle can be regarded as\na truth of logic. If that is so, then at least second-order Peano\narithmetic is reducible to logic alone. Thus a new form of logicism\nwas born; today this view is known as neo-logicism (Hale\n& Wright 2001). Most philosophers of mathematics today doubt that\nHume\u2019s Principle is a principle of logic. Indeed, even\nWright later sought to qualify this claim. Nonetheless, many\nphilosophers of mathematics feel that the introduction of natural\nnumbers through Hume\u2019s Principle is attractive from an\nontological and from an epistemological point of view. Linnebo argues\nthat because the left-hand-side of Hume\u2019s Principle merely\nre-carves the content of its right-hand-side, not much is\nneeded from the world to make Hume\u2019s Principle true. For this\nreason, he calls natural numbers and mathematical objects that can be\nintroduced in a similar way light mathematical objects\n(Linnebo 2018).\n\nWright\u2019s work has drawn the attention of philosophers of\nmathematics to the kind of principles of which Basic Law V\nand Hume\u2019s Principle are examples. These principles are called\nabstraction principles. At present, philosophers of\nmathematics attempt to construct general theories of abstraction\nprinciples that explain which abstraction principles are acceptable\nand which are not, and why (Weir 2003; Fine 2002). Also, it has\nemerged that in the context of weakened versions of second-order\nlogic, Frege\u2019s Basic Law V is consistent. But these weak\nbackground theories only allow very weak arithmetical theories to be\nderived from Basic Law V (Burgess 2005).\n",
