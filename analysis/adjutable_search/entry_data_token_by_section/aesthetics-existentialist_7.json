    "main_text": "The artist\n8. The artist\n\n\nA central, shared assumption of existentialist aesthetics, beyond\nthe stark religious and political differences of the existentialists,\nis the essential ambiguity of the human condition: I am radically free\nas consciousness, yet radically determined by my facticity, the\nphysical, social and other circumstances in which my consciousness\ncomes to the world. On this particular point Heidegger\u2019s\nexistential analytic is a shared reference that brings\ntogether otherwise diverse (or, indeed, antagonistic) thinkers. An\nimportant implication of the emphasis on human facticity is that it\nforges a vital link between philosophy and the arts, which from this\nperspective similarly aim to explore the metaphysical ambiguity of the\nhuman\ncondition.\n\n\nThis grants the artist a special status from at least two\nstandpoints:\n\n\n1) Artistic activity as an existential choice is a privileged mode\nof assuming and realising the paradoxical nature of being human. In\nCamus\u2019 words, artistic activity is one of the key attitudes to\nface the absurd. Camus\u2019 celebration of art in The Myth of\nSysiphus (1942b, 127), which crowns artistic expression as the\nultimate form of \u201cjoy,\u201d would ring true for the other\nexistentialists despite their noted differences on the question of the\nabsurd. Indeed, many other existentialist writers made similar\nstatements reflecting their own life choices, in particular their\ndecision to pursue a philosophical and literary career. The personal\ndimension that can be found in many existentialist writings grants\nthese texts a special status in the history of philosophy, since it\nblurs a boundary that has been essential to the definition of the genre\nof philosophical writing, viz., the boundary between the theoretical\nand the biographical, the personal and the general. Marcel\u2019s\n\u201cmetaphysical diary\u201d is a good case in point. More than\njust an original form of philosophical analysis, the diary illustrates\nMarcel\u2019s own conception of the true self as a gradual awakening\nto the \u201cappeal\u201d of being through the combined practices of\nontological inquiry, artistic creation and personal engagement. Sartre\nalso wrote an autobiographical account of his discovery of the world of\nwords, Les Mots, without doubt one of his masterpieces. The\nsame can be said of Camus\u2019 last narrative text, La\nChute, which mixes autobiography with an ironical account of his\nphilosophy.\n\n\nBeyond their own personal practice, the existentialists also find\nphilosophical significance in the lives of great artists, and are\ninterested in the moment they chose to become artists and how this\nprimordial choice unfolded over the course of their lives. Artists\nprovide paradigmatic case studies for the paradoxes of\n\u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cexpression\u201d (Sartre 1947b,\n1971). Indeed, this is true not just of writers and painters but also\nof actors. For Camus, in fact, actors are those \u201cwho draw the\nbest conclusion\u201d from the metaphysical truth of human existence\n(1942b, 107).\n\n\n2) The artist\u2019s activity is also deeply significant in terms\nof its power of articulating a coherent world. Every person has to make\nexistential choices and has a need for expression, but artists present\nparticularly pure and powerful exemplars of these facets of human\nexistence. Their achievements are worthy of admiration because they\ninvolve the creation of virtual worlds. Every consciousness, every\nbeing-in-the-world is expressive, but only rarely is this expression\ntruly new. Most of the time, human expression is only the\nrepetition of instituted meanings, as in the quasi-automatic use of\nspoken language. Only the great artists show the power of expression in\nits purity, its newness and coherence. To recreate a virtual world that\ncan do justice to the complexity of the real world is an almost\n\u201cmiraculous\u201d fact, as Merleau-Ponty says of C\u00e9zanne.\nAs we can see, the existentialists are no longer that far from the\nromantics in what respects their emphasis on genius.\n\n\nSince the expressive world of a genuine artist is a new perspective\nonto the world that is identical with the artist\u2019s whole\nidiosyncratic mode of being-in-the-world, there will be a deep,\nunderlying continuity in his or her work. The communication that the\nwork of art establishes across time and space operates, first and\nforemost, within the oeuvre itself, with themes and stylistic\ntraits echoing each other throughout it (Camus 1942b, 102\u2013103;\nMerleau-Ponty 1964b, 67). But there is an inherent fatalism in artistic\nactivity. Expressive activity can only ever be an attempt at\nexpression, and it is structurally doomed to fail because there is too\nmuch to reveal in the world. The means of expression are finite, and\nthey operate in a twisted manner, just as much through direct\ndesignation as through ellipse and allusion. This leads Camus to\nconclude that creative activity, like all free activities, is in the\nend only another absurd attempt at dealing with the absurdity of human\nlife (1942b, 130).\n",
