Different Kinds of Organ Sale System\n\nThe expression \u2018organ sale\u2019 covers a wide range of\ndifferent practices.  People most readily associate it with the case\nin which one individual (who needs or wants money) sells his or her\nkidney to another (who needs a kidney).  But there are other\npossibilities too.  One (in countries where the prior consent of the\ndeceased is required for cadaveric organ donation) is to pay people\nliving now for rights over their body after death.  Another (in\ncountries where the consent of relatives is required for cadaveric\norgan donation) is to pay relatives for transplant rights over their\nrecently deceased loved ones' bodies.\n\n\nSince the kidney is the most commonly transplanted organ and since the\nethics literature on organ sale is mainly about kidney sale from live\ndonors, that is the practice on which this entry will focus.\n\u2018Organ sale\u2019 as the term is used here does not include the\nsale of body products (a category which includes blood, eggs,\nhair, and sperm) since this is different in some important respects.\nFor example, the risk of permanent harm is generally much less in the\ncase of blood and hair donation; while, the donation of eggs and sperm\nraises additional issues relating to the creation and parenting of\nadditional future people.  That said, many of the fundamental issues\nare similar and the very same concerns about (for example)\nexploitation and consent arise in both cases.\n\n\nAn important preliminary point is that almost all serious advocates of\nallowing payment for human organs argue not for an unfettered\n\u2018free market\u2019 but for a regulated one.  Radcliffe Richards\net al. (1998, 1950) for example, in their paper \u201cThe Case for\nAllowing Kidney Sales\u201d say:\n\n\n\nIt must be stressed that we are not arguing for the positive conclusion\nthat organ sales must always be acceptable, let alone that there should\nbe an unfettered market.\n\n\nWhile Wilkinson (2003, 132) is typical of organ sale defenders in\nwishing to distance himself from today's (largely\n\u2018underground\u2019) organ trade:\n\n\n\n\u2026 far from being a reason to continue the ban on sale, the\ndreadfulness of present practice may be a reason\nto discontinue prohibition, so that the organ trade can be\nbrought \u2018overground\u2019 and properly regulated.\n\n\n\nDifferent scholars have different views about the precise scope and\nextent of the regulation required, but most support the requirements\nthat organ sellers give valid consent, are paid a reasonable fee, and\nare provided with adequate medical care.  Taylor (2005, 110) for\nexample, says that:\n\n\n\nAt minimum \u2026 a market should require that vendors give their\ninformed consent to the sale of their kidneys, that they not be\ncoerced into selling their kidneys by a third party and that they\nreceive adequate post-operative care.\n\n\n\nOne noteworthy policy proposal comes from Erin and Harris (1994; 2003)\nwho suggest that a market in human organs should have the following\nfeatures:\n\n\n\nIt is limited to a particular geopolitical area, such as a state or\nthe European Union, with only citizens or residents of that area being\nallowed to sell or to receive organs.\n\nThere is a central public body responsible for making (and funding)\nall purchases and for allocating organs fairly in accordance with\nclinical criteria. Direct sales are banned.\n\nPrices are set at a reasonably generous level to attract people\nvoluntarily into the market.\n\n\n\nFeatures (1) and (2) combined are supposed to rule out exploitative\norgan trafficking from poorer countries, while the ban on direct sales\nand allocation by a central agency ensure that the organs go not to\nthose most able to pay, but to those in most need. In common with\nmany other defenders of organ sale, Erin and Harris also propose\nbuilding in practical protections for donors and recipients (e.g.,\nadequate medical care and thorough health checkups before donation\ntakes place).\n\n\nWhen ethically evaluating organ sale therefore it is best to focus\nnot on the worst aspects of today's organ trafficking practices\n(since that is not what any serious ethicist is defending or proposing)\nbut rather on what a reasonably well-regulated system of organ sale,\ncontrolled by some combination of the medical profession and state\nregulators, would look like. More specifically, it should be\nassumed (as it is in what follows) that the doctors, nurses, and\ntransplant coordinators implementing an organ sale system should at\nleast adhere to the standards around consent and clinical care\nadvocated by The Transplantation Society and the World Health\nOrganisation (leaving aside of course those bodies' opposition to\norgan sale itself) (see Other Internet Resources section below).\n\n\nOne final preliminary point is the distinction between questions of\nlaw and public policy, on the one hand, and personal morality on the\nother. The debate about organ sale is largely about whether this\nshould be allowed (by law) and, if so, about what system of\nremuneration would be best. However, there is a set of separable\nquestions about personal morality: about (for example) whether buying\nan organ for oneself might be morally problematic even if it should\nnot be prohibited. Although this distinction is important, and should\nbe kept in mind throughout, it will not be referred to much in the\nfollowing sections. That is because, for the most part, the very same\narguments are used both in attempts to show that organ sale is morally\nproblematic and in attempts to show that it ought not to be\nallowed.\n2. The Case for Organ Sale\n\n\nThree main positive arguments are advanced in favour of permitting\norgan sale.\n2.1 Arguments Based on the Principle of Respect for Autonomy, on Libertarianism, or on a notion of Self-Ownership\n\n\nWhile there are many different variants under this heading, the\nbasic claim common to all is that autonomous and competent adults have\na strong presumptive right to do as they please with their own bodies\n(especially where this is not substantially harmful to third\nparties). Therefore, at least in the absence of strong reasons to\ndo otherwise, people should be allowed to sell parts of their bodies if\nthey so wish. Whether there are any such strong reasons is of\ncourse a moot point and the main candidate reasons are discussed in\nsubsequent sections.\n\n\nNot much directly will be said about these positive arguments for\npermitting organ sale since they rely on more fundamental and general\nquestions in moral and political theory that cannot be tackled within\nthe confines of a piece on organ sale (within SEP, see the\nentries on libertarianism,\n privacy and medicine, and\n property and ownership). Later sections\nwill indirectly address these arguments, though, because many of the\nobjections to sale considered could, if successful, overturn any\ndefeasible presumption in favour of allowing\n\u2018self-ownership\u2019 to prevail.\n2.2 The Saving of Lives\n\n\nThis argument is straightforward. Permitting (or encouraging)\norgan sale will, it is claimed, save lives by (at least partially)\nalleviating the shortage of transplant organs. The saving of\nlives is a good end and organ sale is then defensible as a means of\nachieving that positive end.\n\n\nThe shortage of transplant organs is a major worldwide public health\nproblem.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services\nOrgan Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are approximately\n123,000 patients on transplant waiting lists in the US and around\n300,000 patients waiting for an organ transplant in China (The\nEconomist 2014). In the US in 2014, the overall median waiting time\nfor a kidney transplant was over three and a half years (National\nKidney Foundation 2014).  The situation is similar in the UK\n(Department of Health 2014). Furthermore, waiting list sizes do not\neven fully reflect the actual level of need because doctors are\nsometimes reluctant even to list patients who they feel do not stand a\nrealistic chance of getting an organ in\ntime. (see Other Internet Resources section\nbelow).\n\n\nOpposition to the Saving of Lives Argument takes one of two\nforms. It may be objected to empirically, with the critic arguing\neither that permitting organ sale would be ineffective or that an\nalternative system would work better: for example, the ways in which we\napproach bereaved relatives could be improved, as could the ways in\nwhich the possibility of (unpaid) living donation is publicized, or\nthere could be a move to a Mandated Choice or Presumed Consent\nsystem (Hinkley 2005). Alternatively, one might concede\nthe empirical point that allowing organ sale would be an effective\noption, but nonetheless argue that there are sufficiently strong\ncountervailing (moral or practical) reasons to justify leaving the\nprohibition on sale in place. These reasons are the subject of\nsome later sections.\n\n\nThe Saving of Lives Argument (unless rejected on empirical grounds)\nhas an important role in placing the onus of proof on the shoulders of\nthe prohibitionists (those who wish organ sale to be banned). For\ngiven that this prohibition may, in effect, be causing deaths (or at\nleast preventing the saving of lives) a strong reason to continue with\nit will be required.\n2.3 Consistency\n\n\nMany authors have pointed out that there appears to be no\nfundamental difference between selling organs and other widely accepted\npractices, particularly selling one's own \u2018risky\nlabour\u2019 (work that involves a risk of harm that is the same as or\ngreater than that involved in organ donation) (Harris 1992;\nBrecher 1990, 1994; Wilkinson & Garrard 1996).\nFurthermore, common forms of \u2018risky labour\u2019 (coal mining,\ndeep-sea diving, fire fighting, military service in a just war, etc.)\nare often more dangerous than selling a kidney, but are\nregarded as heroic, rather than condemned; it is seen as just and\nproper to reward those who do these things. This difference in\nattitude cannot be justified in terms of the good consequences that\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 produces, since the consequences of an organ\nsale (often, saving a life) may be just as good or better.\nTherefore, it is inconsistent to allow people to be paid for\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 while not allowing them to be paid for their\norgans. Savulescu (2003, 138) makes the point as follows:\n\n\nIf we should be allowed to sell our labour, why not sell the means to\nthat labour? If we should be allowed to risk damaging our body\nfor pleasure (by smoking or skiing), why not for money which we will\nuse to realise other goods in life? \u2026 or consider the diver. He\ntakes on a job as a deep sea diver which pays him an extra $30,000\n\u2026 This loading is paid because the job has higher risks to\nhis life and health. He takes the job because he likes holidays in\nexpensive exotic locations.\n\nSimilarly, Fabre (2006, 131) argues that:\n\n\nIf someone's interest in raising income by engaging in very risky\nactivities, such as being a full-time boxer or a building-site worker,\nis deemed important enough to confer on her the right to do so\n\u2026 there is no reason to deny her the right to make parts of her body\navailable to others in exchange for money, even though she would incur\nsimilar risks in doing so.\n\nRecently, some scholars have questioned whether organ sale and\n\u2018risky labour\u2019 are as similar as they might appear to be.\nMalmqvist (2015), for example, argues that it is not clear that kidney\nsales and dangerous jobs really do involve comparable risks, all\nthings considered.\n3. Harm and Risk\n\n\nThe first, and most straightforward, objection to organ sale is that\nit is excessively harmful or dangerous for paid organ donors.\nPresent-day organ trafficking certainly does involve excessive\nand unacceptable levels of harm. But, as mentioned earlier, when\nconsidering the moral permissibility of organ sale, it is advisable to\nfocus not on the worst case, but rather on the likely level of harm\nthat would occur within a properly regulated system. Once this is\nborne in mind, the harm argument against organ sale appears vulnerable\nto a number of objections.\n\n\nThe first (an empirical point) is that the most widely discussed form\nof organ sale, kidney sale, is not terribly dangerous if performed in\ngood conditions.  Radcliffe Richards makes the point as follows.\n\n\n\u2026 living organ donation is now so safe that many surgeons\nactively recommend it, and they would hardly do that if they expected\na string of dead or damaged donors. They expect that virtually all\ndonors will make a full recovery to normal health. But the only\nobvious difference between paid and unpaid donation is that the vendor\nreceives something in return which is, to all appearances, a positive\nadvantage. (Radcliffe Richards 2012, 55).\n\nThe UK body NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), for example, informs\nus that the risk of postoperative death (to the donor) is about one in\n3,000. There is also a small risk (less than 1%) of minor\ncomplications (such as chest, wound, or urine infections). As regards\nlong-term health risks, NHSBT claims that there is no long-term effect\non the health of the donor or on his/her remaining kidney, and that\ndonors are at no greater risk of developing kidney failure after\ndonating than anyone in the general population. So, while there are\nsome not completely insignificant risks to consider, arguably these\nare tolerable compared to both the risks to the prospective recipient\nof not receiving the kidney, and the financial benefit to the donor,\nprovided that the level of reward is set at a suitably high level.\n\n\nThe second objection says that, if our concern is exposing the organ\nvendor to risk, then the last thing we should be doing is banning sale\nsince, as Cameron and Hoffenberg put it:\n\n\nIt is the marginalization of paid organ donation that leads to its\nperformance in less than ideal circumstances. Paid organ donations need\nbe no more risky than unpaid.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the best way of avoiding harm to organ vendors is\nnot to criminalize and drive sale underground but rather to accept and\nregulate it. This style of argument is familiar from other contexts:\nnotably debates about the legalization of abortion, drugs, and\nprostitution.\n\n\nThe third (related) objection is that no matter how dangerous paid\ndonation is, it need not be any\nmore dangerous than unpaid donation, since the mere fact of payment\ndoes not add any danger. So if paid donation is wrong because of the\ndanger to which the donor is subjected, then free donation must also be\nwrong on the very same ground. Free donation, though, is not wrong; on\nthe contrary, it is generally regarded as commendable and heroic.\nTherefore, paid donation is not wrong either; or, if it is wrong, it is\nwrong because of something other than the danger to which the donor is\nsubjected (Radcliffe Richards 2012; Wilkinson and Garrard 1996).\n\n\nIt might be argued that what is wrong with organ sale is not danger\nper se but rather the fact that someone is being paid to\nendanger herself. There are two readings of this. One is as a worry\nabout consent, the idea being that payment invalidates the\nvendor's consent; this will be examined in Section 5. The other\nis as a moral principle according to which (independently of concerns\nabout consent) it is wrong to pay someone to endanger herself. Quite\nwhat the basis for such a principle might be is hard to fathom and it\ndoes seem implausible for reasons given during the earlier discussion\nof consistency. Paying people to undertake dangerous and/or\nunpleasant work is widespread and, while the world might well be a\nbetter place if people were not required to undertake such tasks, it\nwould be hard to defend the view that all such arrangements are wrong:\nespecially in those cases where the work is done voluntarily for fair\npay.\n4. Altruism\n\n\nA very different style of argument against organ sale appeals to the\nsupposed value of altruism. These arguments arise in a number of\ndifferent forms, but most of them have the following underlying\nstructure:\n\nAltruism is a good thing, either intrinsically, or because of its\npositive effects (or both).\n\nPermitting and/or practicing organ sale would lessen the amount of\naltruism in the world.\n\n So we\nought not to permit and/or practice organ sale.\n\n4.1 Is altruism (always) a good thing?\n\n\nAltruism is usually defined as acting out of a concern for the\nwell-being of others (Nagel 1970; Scott & Seglow\n2007). Why might one think that such actions are morally good? Two\nmain answers are available. The first is that altruism is intrinsically\ngood and to be contrasted with morally bad characteristics and\nmotivations, in particular selfishness. The second (which is not\nincompatible with the first) says that altruism is good because of its\npositive effects, not only its direct effects on the person to whom the\naltruism is directed but also its indirect effects on society.\nBoth answers have considerable plausibility. Many examples of\nacting out of disinterested concern for the well-being of others do\nseem to be clear-cut cases of moral virtue. And it seems\nlikely that, all other things being equal, a society with more\naltruistic acts would be a better place to live than one with\nfewer.\n\n\nThat said, two reservations about the claim that altruism is a good\nthing should be noted. First, altruistic acts are not always morally\ngood. Scott and Seglow (2007, 2) give the following very\npertinent example:\n\n\nConsider the racist organ donor \u2026 who wishes to donate their\norgans, but only to those of their own race. They are altruistic\nbut hardly moral.\n\n\nIndeed, there seem to be several ways in which an altruistic act might\nbe wrong. For example:\n\n The\naltruist is culpably mistaken about what is really in the interests of\nthe person s/he is trying to help and ends up harming rather than\nhelping.\n\n The\naltruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but her\nintervention is wrongfully paternalistic.\n\nThe\naltruist benefits the person s/he is trying to help, but in so doing\nwrongfully harms innocent third parties.\n\n\nIt is not hard to come up with examples in which A\nloves B so much that\nA is prepared to do bad things to a third party, C,\nin order to benefit\nA. Such cases range from minor wrongdoing to serious evil. So, as\nMcLachlan (1998) points out, while many acts of altruism are paradigm\ncases of virtue, others are \u2018extremely wicked\u2019.\n\nIn defence of the value of altruism, it could be argued that even\nthough many altruistic acts are wrong, all things considered,\nnonetheless altruism is always a positive (or\n\u2018right-making\u2019) characteristic. On this view, the\nanalysis of Scott and Seglow's racist donor example is that,\nwhile his racism is to be condemned, his altruism is not and that, in\nthe case of racist donation (assuming that this really is wrong, all\nthings considered), the \u2018negative\u2019 racism simply\noutweighs the \u2018positive\u2019 altruism. If this\nview is correct, then the claim that some altruistic acts are wrong\nbecomes less relevant than it might at first appear, since what matters\nis the value of altruism as a positive moral property of\nactions, not whether all altruistic acts are good or permissible\nall things considered.\n4.2 Would organ sale displace or reduce altruism?\n\n\n\u2026 if to a voluntary blood donor system we add the possibility of\nselling blood, we have only expanded the individual's range of\nalternatives. If he derives satisfaction from giving \u2026 he can\nstill give, and nothing has been done to impair that right\n(Arrow 1972, 350).\n\n\n\nAs the quotation from Arrow (above) suggests, there is a puzzle\nabout why permitting payment for blood or organs should be thought to\nreduce the amount of altruism in the world. For why\ncouldn't paid and unpaid donation systems peacefully coexist,\nwith people who want to give freely continuing to do so? Furthermore,\npaid donations may even add to the amount of altruism in the world. For\nthere can be cases in which a person sells an organ not for\n\u2018selfish\u2019 reasons, but in order to pay (for example) for\nsomeone else's medical care (Brecher 1994).\n\n\nGiven this, how exactly will allowing organ sale lead to there being\nless altruism in the world? The main answer given is that it would\nundermine the practice of free donation. Abouna (1991, 167), for\nexample, claims that there is:\n\n\n\u2026 considerable evidence to indicate that marketing in human\norgans will eventually deprecate and destroy the present willingness of\nmembers of the public to donate their organs out of altruism.\n\n\n\nOne explanation for this is that when we give people financial\nincentives to do some act this undermines or reduce the extent to which\nthey feel morally obliged to do that act. In this way, financial\nincentives \u2018crowd out\u2019 altruism (Satz 2010, 193; Sandel 2012).\n\n\nBut is it really true that kidney sale would undermine the practice of\nfree donation? Well, it could do and ultimately this is a\ncontested empirical matter about which, as a mere philosopher, one\nought not to claim to have an authoritative view. That said, there are\nreasons for scepticism about the claim that kidney sale would\nundermine the practice of free donation.\n\nThe most important of these is that, at least as far as living\ndonation is concerned, there is not a very large practice out there to\nbe undermined. Given the pain and inconvenience involved, free\ndonation is likely to remain a minority pursuit. Living donation is\nadmittedly on the rise and, according to the National Kidney\nFoundation, almost a third of US kidney transplants in 2014 came from\nlive donors.  However, this is still a 'drop in the ocean' compared to\nthe 102,000 people on the waiting list and a majority of these live\ndonors are friends or (more commonly) relatives of the recipient, or\nare part of a 'pairing arrangement' (where A's relative donates to B,\nand B's relative donates to A).  Given such people's strong interest\nin saving their friends' or relatives' lives, one would think that\nmany of them will not be put off by the mere possibility of payment.\nAnd it is notable that fewer than 200 people in the US in the same\nyear became unrelated anonymous live donors.\n\n\nKidneys may then be importantly different from (say) blood. For if\nthere is no substantial system of free donation in place, then free\ndonation cannot be undermined by permitting sale. But if an almost\nadequate system of free donation does exist (as, in many countries, it\ndoes with blood) then there is a serious possibility of its being\nundermined. Thus, the argument which says that what is wrong with sale\nis that free donation would be undermined might well work for blood,\neven if it does not for kidneys. The same might be true of the\narguments in favour of an altruistic blood system proposed by Titmuss\nand others. Perhaps the voluntary blood donation system (and\nindeed a voluntary posthumous organ donation system) can be used as a\nmethod of encouraging a valuable culture of altruism, but this is much\nless likely to work in the case of living organ donation\n(Archard 2002; Campbell 2009; Titmuss 1997).\n\n\nThis difference between kidneys and blood reveals a general structural\ndifficulty for altruism arguments against sale. For altruism arguments\n(insofar as they work at all) work better for those things which are\nalready freely donated on a large scale, than for those things which\nare hardly freely donated at all. Hence, they will tend to be most\nsuccessful where, in a sense, they are needed least\u2014because if\nthere is already widespread free donation, then commercialization will\nbe unnecessary. This is not a decisive objection, since there are\nthings which are in short supply in spite of widespread free donation\n(blood and sperm might be examples of this).  But it is a problem for\nthis style of argument because there will be a tendency for it to be\nleast successful where it is most needed (Radcliffe Richards 1996,\n2009, 2012; Wilkinson & Moore 1999).\n4.3 Altruism, Supererogation, and Duties to Rescue\n\n\nHowever, even if altruism can survive this first challenge, there is a\nsecond reason to question its importance for the debate about the\npermissibility of organ sale. This is the distinction between cases in\nwhich altruism is obligatory (where there is a moral duty to\nhelp others) and those in which altruism is\nsupererogatory (morally good, but not morally\nrequired\u2014going \u2018above and beyond\u2019 one's duty)\n(Wilkinson 2003). This distinction is relevant for the following\nreason. If (say) altruistic kidney donation were morally obligatory,\nthen to demand money for one's organ (and, arguably, to accede to such\na demand) would be wrong. But if, on the other hand, altruistic\ndonation were supererogatory, then to demand money for one's organ\nwould not be wrong. Rather, it would be merely non-supererogatory:\nperhaps not good, but not wrong.  So, with this\ndistinction in place, one might (at least in some cases) accept that\naltruistic donations are good whilst also saying that there is nothing\nwrong with non-altruistic donation\u2014the point being that\nnon-altruistic donation, while not as good as altruistic donation, is\nnonetheless (morally) permissible. This has implications for the sort\nof altruism argument which can be made against organ sale. If it could\nbe shown that altruistic donation is obligatory then the argument\nwould be stronger, or at least more straightforward, because it would\nfollow that selling was wrong (it is wrong to demand money for what\none ought to be giving freely anyway). But if all that could be shown\nwas that altruistic donation is good, then it would not follow from\nthis, or at least it would not follow directly, that selling is\nwrong. For it might be merely non-supererogatory (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).\n\n\nThis may be one area then where the differences between different\npossible organ sale systems are relevant. For it is not wildly\nimplausible to posit the existence of a duty to donate one's\norgans for posthumous transplantation. Indeed, this view is not\nconfined to utilitarian bioethicists, with even the Church of England\nstating in 2007 that (posthumous) organ donation is a Christian\nduty (BBC News Online 2007). Thus there may well be a valid\naltruism argument against a system in which people sell rights to their\nbody after death: the argument being that they should donate them\nanyway without expecting payment. This style of argument looks\nless promising, though, when looking at non-directed living kidney\ndonation (to strangers). Here, I suspect most of us want to say\nthat becoming such a donor is heroic and supererogatory, not a moral\nobligation, and so the altruism argument does not engage. Another\ninteresting example is blood (from living donors). In many\ncountries, there is a widespread view that people ought to do this\nfreely and (if this view is correct) this could underpin an altruism\nargument against paying for blood: the claim being that people ought\nnot to be paid for that which they have an obligation freely to\ngive.\n5. Inducements and Consent\n\n\nMonetary incentives, it is sometimes argued, make valid consent\ndifficult, impossible, or problematic (Radcliffe Richards\n2010, 2012). Some of the main arguments offered for this view are that\u2014\n\nFinancial incentives encourage people to do things that they would\nnot otherwise do.\nFinancial incentives encourage people to do things that are likely\nto be harmful to them and which go against their \u2018better\njudgement\u2019.\nFinancial incentives can make people's actions, consents, and\ndecisions less autonomous or less voluntary (Wilkinson 2005).\n\n\n\n(a) will not work. For the fact that payments encourage people\nto do things that they otherwise would not does not, in and of itself,\ninvalidate consent. If it did, consent problems would be endemic\nand occur every time someone was encouraged by payment to go to work\nfor wages or to surrender property for a price. So although some people\nwould only provide organs because of the money, this fact alone would\nnot invalidate consent.\n\n\n(b) is more plausible. Or at least it is plausible to suppose\nthat we ought not to encourage donors to subject themselves to more\nthan a certain level of danger. But the fundamental problem with\nthis would be not payment or consent, but rather the fact that they are\nexposed to too much danger. So, provided that we have an adequate\nway of controlling and regulating risk to organ sellers this particular\nworry about payment ought not to arise.\n\n\nThis is supported by two additional considerations.\n\n\nFirst, as mentioned earlier, the amount of danger remains the same\nregardless of whether or not payment takes place. So if someone\nobjects to paying donors on the grounds that payment will encourage\nexcessive risk-taking, s/he ought to object to donation itself\n(including free donation) not just the payment. Imagine someone\nwho objects to paying astronauts on the grounds that it encourages them\nto do something excessively dangerous. Surely we should say to\nher that, if the objection is danger, s/he should object to space\ntravel in general, not (just) to paid space\ntravel. Much the same goes for paying organ donors. If the\nworry is danger, we should object to dangerous donation of all kinds,\nnot just the paid variety.\n\n\nSecond, it is not clear that monetary incentives make people act\nagainst their better interests or judgement. Indeed, this is a\nrather surprising view to take since people trade off monetary gains\nand losses against other factors on a daily basis; commerce and work\nrequire us to do this all the time. So if an adequately informed\nand competent person decides, after deliberation, that it is worth\nsubjecting herself to a given risk in return for $10,000 then we should\nnot just assume that s/he is acting against her better judgement since,\nfor all we know, the $10,000 is more valuable to her than avoiding the\nrisk (Wilkinson 2005).\n\n\nFinally, there is (c): the idea that financial incentives, when\nallowed to operate in certain conditions, \u2018pressurise\u2019\npeople in ways which are harmful and/or which render their decisions\nnot truly voluntary.  Rippon (2014, 148), for example, tells us that:\n\n\n\n\u2026 because people in poverty often find themselves either\nindebted or in need of cash to meet their own basic needs and those of\ntheir families, they would predictably find themselves faced with\nsocial or legal pressure to pay the bills by selling their organs, if\nselling organs were permitted. So we would harm people in poverty by\nintroducing a legal market that would subject them to such\npressures.\n\nIt is difficult, he argues:\n\n\n\u2026 to see how regulation could prevent the kind of pressure in\nquestion, while still maintaining the organ supply. Suppose that a\nhigh minimum price for organs was set. This would prevent one sort of\nexploitation ... as everyone who sold an organ would be substantially\ncompensated for it. However, this would do nothing to address the\nproblem that some might sell their organs out of economic desperation,\nrather than out of a choice made free from external pressure.\n\nThe underlying argument here is that certain sorts of payment, or\npayment in certain circumstances, exert undue influence on a person's\ndecision (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2002). Accusations of undue\ninducement almost always occur in one of two different contexts. The\nfirst is where the \u2018victim\u2019 of the inducement is in\ndesperate need of money; the second is where the \u2018victim\u2019\nis not desperate, but is offered such a huge amount of money to\ndo X that doing X becomes almost irresistible.\nWilkinson terms these \u2018desperate offeree\u2019 cases and\n\u2018enormous offer\u2019 cases. One notable thing that these have\nin common is that there is a huge gap between the offeree's\nwelfare-level if s/he does not accept the offer, and her welfare-level\nif s/he does accept (Wilkinson 2003).\n\n\nIs valid consent possible in these cases? In both scenarios it\nmay be terrifically hard to decline. However this does not mean\nthat valid consent to the offer is impossible. Radcliffe Richards\n(2010, 291) makes the point as follows:\n\n\nIt does not normally occur to us that people coerced by circumstances\ninto doing things they would not otherwise do should have their consent\nregarded as invalid. If you have cancer, with the choice between\nrisking its unchecked progression and putting up with pretty nasty\ntreatments, nobody would think of arguing that the narrow range of\noptions made your consent to treatment invalid.\n\n\n\nSo even if we grant that the recipients of enormous offers and\ndesperate offerees will find it hard to refuse, this does not mean that\nthey cannot validly consent. This must be so. Otherwise, it would be\nimpossible for anyone ever to consent validly to lifesaving operations,\nnot to mention lottery \u2018jackpot\u2019 wins or large wage rises;\nthe mere fact that a proposal is tremendously attractive does not mean\nthat it cannot be voluntarily accepted.\n\n\nA slightly different tack is to invoke the idea of coercion by\ncircumstances, specifically coercion by poverty (Annas 1984; Rippon 2014;\nTorcello & Wear 2000). Thus, someone might argue that\neven though valid consent from \u2018desperate\u2019 people is\npossible in principle for the reasons just given, consent will normally\nbe invalid when the person consenting (e.g., to selling her kidney) is\ncoerced by poverty. The difference between coercion by poverty\nand Radcliffe Richards' cancer example is supposed to be that\nwhereas the cancer is a morally neutral natural occurrence, the poverty\n(at least in some cases) is the result of immoral acts and policies; it\nis unjust poverty.\n\n\nOne initial response to the \u2018coercion by poverty\u2019 refers\nus back to the fact that almost all defenders of organ sale are arguing\nnot for unfettered international trafficking in transplant organs but\nrather for a regulated system of compensation. Within the context\nof a regulated system (particularly that advocated by Erin and Harris,\nwhich would be limited to one economic area) there is no reason to\nbelieve that most organ sellers would be desperately poor. Organ\nsale may admittedly be more attractive to those with the least money\n(for why would someone rich need or want to sell an organ?) but then\nmuch the same can be said of some of the least sought-after and worst\npaid agricultural and cleaning jobs, and we do not generally say that\npeople cannot consent to do these or that these types of employment\nshould be banned.\n\n\nBut let us allow for the sake of argument that organ vendors would\nbe very poor. What would follow from this? Poverty (or\nthreatening poverty) can clearly be a method of coercion. An\nobvious example of this is the behaviour of exploitative employers\nduring times of high unemployment. They can threaten workers with\nunemployment\u2014and, hence, poverty\u2014if they do not comply\nwith their demands (Wilkinson 2003). The position of the\nprospective organ buyer though seems rather unlike that of the\nexploitative employer and, as Wilkinson and Moore (1999, 378) point\nout:\n\n\n\n\u2026 it is a necessary condition of an offer's being\ncoercive that the offerer is also responsible for the bad circumstances\nof the offeree. For example, if we poison you and then offer to provide\nthe only available antidote in exchange for your stamp collection, that\nis coercive. If you are poisoned in a way for which we are not\nresponsible, and we make the same offer, that is not coercive \u2026\nas long as those making an offer are not responsible for the\ncircumstances of the potential subjects, their offer is not\ncoercive.\n\n\n\nSo in order for prospective organ purchasers to be coercing through\npoverty, they must be responsible for the poverty. This need not\nmean that they caused the poverty, for people may be responsible for\n(improving or preventing) situations that they have not themselves\ncaused. Hence, another scenario in which the buyers may be\nresponsible is if they have a positive duty to rescue the prospective\nsellers from poverty (and \u2018for free\u2019 rather than in\nexchange for an organ).\n\n\nAn illuminating analogy is Nozick's Drowning Case\n(Nozick 1969, 449). This is a situation in which P (the occupant\nof a boat) offers to save Q (who is drowning close to the boat) but\nonly if Q promises to pay P $10,000 within three days of reaching\nshore. One view of this case is that P coerces Q (into paying) if and\nonly if P has a freestanding duty to save Q without reward.\nWhether P does in fact have such a duty is not something we need to\ndecide upon here and that will depend upon a wide range of facts about\nthe situation.\n\n\nOrgan vendors then are somewhat like the person in the boat.\nIf they have an independent duty to alleviate the poverty (i.e., a duty\nthat does not depend on their getting an organ in return) then to\ninsist on an organ for the money (when they should have been giving the\nmoney anyway) would be coercive. It would be like charging\nsomeone who would otherwise drown in a situation where there is a duty\nfreely to rescue.\n\n\nIt is not hard to see how, in principle, this style of coercion\nargument could work against organ sale. What is much harder is working\nout whether, in most of the cases envisaged, organ buyers have a duty\nto alleviate the poverty. The case most often discussed is where the\norgan purchaser is a rich Westerner and the vendor is someone\ndesperately poor from the developing world. The Westerner, it is said,\nuses poverty to \u2018force\u2019 (coerce) the poor person into\ngiving up the organ. This may be the case if the Westerner\nhas a duty to alleviate the prospective organ seller's poverty. But,\nas well as difficult general questions about global distributive\njustice and the like, there is also the question of whether the\nindividual in question is directly responsible for alleviating the\nother's poverty in these cases. The problem with attributing\nresponsibility to individual organ purchasers is that the extent to\nwhich they have a positive \u2018duty to rescue\u2019 those in dire\npoverty may vary enormously depending on their own positions of wealth\nand power, and on the extent to which they have already done virtuous\nthings in an attempt to act on their duties towards the poor.  For\nexample, a Western organ purchaser could have already devoted a large\npart of her income and time to charitable projects aimed at the\nalleviation of poverty and may herself have relatively little\nmoney\u2014just enough to buy a kidney. Do we really want to say that\nsuch a person has a duty to give her money to the prospective organ\nvendor without receiving the kidney (without which she may well die)\nin return?\n\n\nA more promising option is to focus on groups rather than\nindividuals. One might argue, for example, that the rich nations have a\nduty to alleviate poverty in the poor nations. With this (plausible)\nassumption in place, it could then be argued that when the rich nations\ncollectively offer the poor nations money (but only) in return for\norgans, this is not really an offer, but rather a threat (a threat to\nwrongfully withhold resources if they do not hand over organs).\nThe rich nations (it is argued) should be giving the money anyway, not\ndemanding organs in return for it. So what the rich nations are doing\nis threatening to withhold resources to which the poor nations have a\nmoral right, unless the poor nations hand over organs: a seemingly\nclear case of coercion.\n\n\nHowever, there is a further problem with the \u2018coercion by\npoverty\u2019 argument\u2014or at least there is a serious problem\nwith attempting to use it specifically as an argument for the legal\nprohibition of organ sale. The problem is that the argument works\nequally well against all trade between the rich nations and the poor\nones. For (in simplistic terms) if the rich nations have a duty to give\nresources to the poor nations, then any time that the rich nations\ninsist on trading rather than donating, they will be practicing\ncoercion\u2014threatening to withhold money that they should be\ngiving anyway, unless they are provided with goods of one sort or\nanother. And, as far as the coercion argument is concerned, there is no\nreason to single out the trade in organs for special treatment. This\nlooks like a decisive objection to the coercion argument. Either it\ndoes not work at all, or it works but \u2018proves too much\u2019 and\ngives us no reason to single out organ sale for condemnation and/or\nprohibition.\n\n\nOne possible reply to this is to make a distinction between forms of\nglobal trade which benefit developing world economies and societies\nand those which do not. One might then argue that a difference between\nthe organ trade and (say) the development of hi-tech manufacturing is\nthat only the latter has the potential to emancipate populations in\nthe longer-term, whereas buying an organ is merely a \u2018resource\ngrab\u2019 with no positive side-effects on socio-economic\ndevelopment. Like many of the other arguments discussed in this entry,\nmuch depends on the how the empirical evidence shapes up, but this\nresponse does seem to have some plausibility.  However, it could still\nbe claimed that the international organ trade is no worse (as far as\nthe quality of consent is concerned) than any other form of\ninternational trade which fails positively to contribute to long-term\ndevelopment. So perhaps the organ trade is (in this respect) on a par\nwith logging, or mining, or some basic forms of agriculture.\n\n\nPerhaps more importantly, though, we must remember that, in any\ncase, most of these concerns about coercion and poverty can be dealt\nwith by having a controlled system such as the Erin-Harris\nproposal. Of course it is not the case that there is no unfair\npoverty within the Western countries that they have in mind. And\nso, even under the Erin-Harris system, some account would have to be\ntaken of the coercion by poverty argument. Perhaps, for example,\nwe would want to say that, in order for the national organ purchasing\nagency not to be coercing-by-poverty it needs to be the case that there\nis a minimum wage law and a welfare state that are at least close to\nbeing fair, so that there is no poverty in society for which the state\nis morally responsible (either actively or by omission). This is\nprobably a lot to ask but then we must remember that any actual organ\nsale system, along with all other aspects of the economy, is unlikely\nto be perfect; and, provided that the organ sale system is not\nsubstantially more exploitative or harmful than most other widely\naccepted economic transactions then it would seem arbitrary and unfair\nto single it out for particular condemnation or prohibition.\n\n\nFinally, Radcliffe Richards offers an argument to the effect that\neven if there is a consent problem caused by \u2018coercion through\npoverty\u2019 (a claim about which she is sceptical) this is unlikely\nto be a sound basis for prohibiting sale. She asks us to\nconsider a case in which your daughter is kidnapped. The\nkidnappers ask for a ransom in return for your daughter's\nlife. Clearly, your consent to this arrangement (if forthcoming)\nwould be invalid because coerced. But\u2014\n\n\nSuppose the police appeared on the kidnapping scene and prevented you\nfrom signing the [ransom payment] document, perhaps with the outcome\nthat your child was shot. They might have good public policy\nreasons for doing this \u2026 but it would be preposterous for them\nto claim that they were doing it because the consent you were trying to\ngive would be invalid \u2026 [T]he whole point of declaring\ninvalidity is to protect the alleged consenter, and here the police\nwould actually be compounding the wrong done to you by constricting\nstill further the range of options already constricted by the\nkidnapper (Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).\n\n\n\nAccording to Radcliffe Richards, this is analogous to the situation\nin which state action is used to prevent organ sale. As with the\nkidnapping, there may be legitimate reasons for such state action (for\nexample, if the police suspect that the organ purchaser's surgeon\nis planning to take several organs and then kill the organ\nvendor). However, the invalidity of the seller's consent\n(due to poverty) would not in and of itself be a sufficient reason for\nstate intervention in these circumstances.\n\n\nSince the metaphorical coercer (poverty) is still present, and the\nindividual is making the best choice among a still-constricted range of\noptions, disallowing the choice is like preventing you from meeting the\ndemands of the kidnapper while he still has your child\n(Radcliffe Richards 2010, 294).\n\n\n\nSo even if there is a quality of consent problem in these\norgan sale cases this is unlikely to justify prohibition.\n6. Exploitation, Instrumentalisation, and Objectification\n\n\nPerhaps the most commonly discussed objection to organ sale is the\nclaim that it is exploitative (Greasley 2014; Hughes 1998; Lawler\n2011, 2014; Wilkinson 2003). Saying what exploitation amounts to is\nitself a complex task, however, and I will not say much here about how\nit should be defined (see the SEP entry\non exploitation).  It is, however,\nworth noting that, on one view, defective (or invalid) consent is a\nnecessary condition for the occurrence of exploitation. Thus\n(according to this view) a transaction can only be exploitative if the\nputative victim of exploitation is coerced, lacking capacity,\nill-informed, or manipulated (or more generally, if there is some\nconsent-invalidating factor in play). If this view of the relationship\nbetween consent and exploitation were correct, then the discussion of\nexploitation could be ended here; for consent issues were dealt with\nin the previous section and the exploitation worry about organ sale\nwould only be worth taking seriously inasmuch as those consent\narguments discussed above were sound. However, not everyone thinks\nthat defective consent is required for there to be exploitation and so\nthere may be some mileage in looking independently at\nexploitation.\n\n\nSimilar thoughts apply to the unjust distribution of benefits and\nburdens. One view is that a transaction can only count as\nexploitative if the relevant benefits and burdens are unfairly\ndistributed in favour of the exploiter and/or against the\nexploited. With this in mind, Harris (1992, 120) usefully\ndistinguishes between two kinds of exploitation-claim. The\nfirst:\n\n\n\u2026 involves the idea of some disparity in the value of an\nexchange of goods and services.\n\n\nExploitation concerns of this kind, or at least most of them, can be\ntaken care of by utilizing some version of the Erin-Harris proposal\n(discussed above) since this is designed to ensure that organ\nsellers receive just rewards and adequate care, whilst also going a\nlong way towards ensuring that the distribution of organs to transplant\nrecipients is fair. And while there may be some practical\nobstacles to creating such a system there seem no reasons to suppose\nthat it is impossible in principle.\n\nThere is, however, another sense of \u2018exploitation\u2019.\nThis is:\n\n\n\u2026 the idea of wrongful use and may occur when there are\nno financial or commercial dimensions to the transaction. A classic\ncase here would be where it is claimed that lovers may exploit one\nanother, that is, use one another in some wrongful way. The most\nfamiliar of such wrongful ways in this context might be where it is\nclaimed that one partner uses the other or treats the other merely as a\n\u2018sex object\u2019 (1992, 120).\n\n\n\nSimilarly Goodin (1987, 166) notes that:\n\n\n\nLovers can exploit one another just as surely as can economic\nclasses. Yet neither party in an affectionate relationship is\nfunctioning in any standard sense as a \u2018factor of\nproduction\u2019. Nor, since neither party is creating valuable\nobjects in any ordinary respect, does it in that context make much\nsense to define exploitation in the standard economics-based terms\n\u2026\n\n\n\nSo it looks as if (in Harris's terms) \u2018wrongful use\u2019\nexploitation is independent of some of the usual concerns about\ndistributive justice and could persist even within a distributively\nfair organ sale system. Exploitation of this second kind is closely\nrelated to a number of other concepts or terms (Wilkinson 2003). One\nof these is\nobjectification: wrongfully treating something (or someone)\nthat is not a mere object as if it were a mere object. Another is\ninstrumentalisation, which can be similarly defined as\ntreating something (or someone) that is not a mere means as if it were\na mere means (Davis 2009). A third is commodification,\ntreating something (or someone) that is not a mere commodity as if it\nwere a mere commodity (Sandel 2012; Wilkinson 2000).  These ideas are\nclosely connected to the Kantian idea of dignity (Radin 1996). As\nDillon (2010) puts it, on this view:\n\n\nTo be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of any\nother kind of being: it is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the\nonly response that is appropriate to such a being is respect.\n\n\n\nSo we have the claim that exploitation,\nobjectification, instrumentalisation, or commodification could occur within\ndistributively fair transactions. How might this apply in the\ncase of organ sale? Specifically, how could these ideas underpin\na sound moral argument against organ sale?\n\n\nIn common with some of the arguments considered earlier, attempts to\nuse these ideas in an argument against organ sale run up against two\nproblems. First, there is the similarity of (free) donation and\nsale. Let us say that someone objects to organ sale (even where\nthere is consent and distributive justice) on the grounds that the\nseller's body (organ) or the seller herself is objectified or\ninstrumentalised. This immediately raises the question of why the\nvery same consideration does not apply to (free) donation, which is\nstandardly thought to be admirable rather than morally dubious.\nFor in both cases, a part of the donor's (or vendor's) body\nis removed and treated (quite possibly solely) as a means by the\nrecipient and the transplant team.\n\n\nThen, second, there is the question of consent. For can we\nreally make sense of someone being instrumentalised or objectified (in\nthe relevant normative or pejorative senses of these terms) if what is\ndone to them is done with valid consent, and especially if what is done\nto them would not have been done but for their giving of valid\nconsent? So one possible principle that we might wish to endorse\nhere is that:\n\n\nIf A requires and obtains from B valid consent to\ndo x to B, that is sufficient to guarantee that, in\ndoing x to B, A does not wrongfully\ninstrumentalise or objectify B.\nOr, to put it another way, as with the other sort of\nexploitation discussed above, perhaps even instrumentalisation and\nobjectification turn out to rely on defective consent: or perhaps\nrather on the fact that the putative instrumentaliser (objectifier)\ndoes not care about or require valid consent. Alternatively we\nmight make this principle slightly more cautious and include a\nsubstantial harm constraint as follows:\n\n\nIf A requires and obtains from B valid consent to\ndo x to B,\nand if doing x to B will not substantially\nharm B, that is sufficient to guarantee that, in\ndoing x to B, A does not wrongfully\ninstrumentalise or objectify B.\nTo help think through these principles consider the case of Manuel\nWackenheim. Wackenheim is a (so-called) \u2018dwarf\u2019 who (until\na ban was imposed by the local mayor) made a living from being\n\u2018tossed\u2019 by customers in bars and nightclubs. This\n\u2018tossing\u2019 formed part of a dwarf throwing\ncompetition\u2014a sport \u2018in which the aim of the competitors\nis to fling a dwarf over the furthest distance possible\u2019 (Millns\n1996, 375). Wackenheim appeared keen to pursue his chosen career and\ndidn't welcome the ban on dwarf throwing, saying \u2018this spectacle\nis my life; I want to be allowed to do what I want\u2019.\nWackenheim can be regarded both as intrinsically valuable\nas a person but also as instrumentally valuable as an object\n(specifically as a projectile). That is, there is no reason in\nprinciple why a friend of his could not both respect him as an\n\u2018end\u2019 and recognise the fact that his body is formed in a\nway which makes it instrumentally valuable to \u2018dwarf\nthrowers\u2019. But could Wackenheim's friend actually use\nhim as a projectile, whilst at the same time respecting the fact\nthat he is a person or (in Kantian terms) an end-in-himself? It\nis the overall context of the relationship, along with other structural\nfeatures of the situation, which determine whether he is appropriately\nrespected. Surely this must be right, for it would be extraordinarily\nhard to argue plausibly that it is impossible, in all contexts, to use\nWackenheim as a projectile whilst at the same time respecting his\npersonhood. For what if he enjoys being thrown, gets paid for it, and\nfreely and knowingly consents to it? If for these reasons\u2014i.e.,\nbecause I want to ensure that he derives pleasure and money, and am\ncertain that it is what he really wants etc.\u2014I throw him, then\nthere seems no basis whatsoever for saying that I am failing to respect\nhis personhood. For in such a case, I am (let us assume) deliberately\ngiving him what he wants (and wants in a free, informed and otherwise\nautonomous way) and deliberately benefiting him. How can this be a\nfailure to recognise his status as an \u2018end\u2019?\n\n\nIt is difficult to see how it could be. Although we should add two\ncaveats. First, this doesn't rule out the existence of other\nseparate moral objections to \u2018dwarf throwing\u2019. Second,\nthere certainly are contexts in which this practice would constitute\nwrongful instrumentalisation. These may include cases in which the\npeople thrown are substantially harmed and cases in which they do not\nconsent or in which their consent is invalid. Indeed, this is the main\npoint. What does all the ethical work here is context: in particular\nissues relating to the existence and quality of the\n\u2018dwarf's\u2019 consent\u2014and perhaps also those\nrelating to harm and welfare.\n\n\nMuch the same goes for organ sale, or indeed (unpaid) organ\ndonation. When we look at a person with a view to using her\norgans for transplantation we are of course viewing at least the organ,\nor possibly even the person, as a means to an end, and as a useful\nobject. But this is not inconsistent with also respecting the\nperson's dignity and viewing her as an end-in-herself provided\nthat we take seriously the person's rational agency by requiring\nher valid consent for the organ removal and by ensuring that any risk\nof harm is minimized and reasonable. The particular issues for\norgan sale (as opposed to free donation) then turn out to be those\ndiscussed at length in previous sections. Perhaps there is an\nincreased risk that consent will be flawed in sale cases; if organ\nremoval proceeded without proper consent then that could be a failure\nto respect the person. And perhaps there is an increased risk\nthat harm will occur in sale cases; if so (and if the risk goes above a\ncertain level) then perhaps this also would constitute a failure to\nrespect the person. Thus the appeal to dignity,\ninstrumentalisation, and objectification would seem merely to amplify\nsome of the concerns aired previously about consent and\nharm.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abouna, G., 1991, \u201cThe Negative Impact of Paid Organ\nDonation\u201d in W.
