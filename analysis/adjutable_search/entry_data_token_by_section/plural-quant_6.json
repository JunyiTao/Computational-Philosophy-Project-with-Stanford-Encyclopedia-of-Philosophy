    "main_text": "Plural Quantification vs. Second-Order Quantification || Modal contexts\n2.3 Modal contexts\n\nAnother way in which plural quantification and second-order\nquantification come apart emerges in modal contexts. It is often a\ncontingent matter whether an object falls under a concept. Although I\nam wearing shoes, I might not have done so. So there is a concept\n\\(F\\) under which I fall but might not have fallen. In contrast, it\nseems that being one of some objects is never contingent. Consider the\npeople \\(aa\\) who are all and only the people currently wearing shoes.\nThen not only am I one of these people, but this seems to hold of\nnecessity (assuming the existence of the relevant objects). Removing\nme from this plurality of people would just result in a different\nplurality. For the plurality \\(aa\\) to be the plurality it is, it must\ninclude precisely the objects that it in fact includes. So in any\nworld in which the objects \\(aa\\) exist at all, I must be one of them.\nTrue, I might not have been wearing shoes. But even so I would have\nbeen one of \\(aa\\), only then \\(aa\\) would not have been all and only\nthe people wearing shoes. Plural names and variables thus seem to be\nrigid in a way that is analogous to the familiar rigidity of singular\nnames and variables: in any world in which a plural term denotes at\nall, it denotes the same objects. In particular, it is widely believed\nthat pluralities are subject to the following two principles:\n\n\\[\n\\tag{10}\nu \\prec xx \\rightarrow \\Box(\\EExists xx \\rightarrow u \\prec xx)\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\tag{11}\n\\neg(u \\prec xx) \\rightarrow \\Box(\\EExists u \\amp \\EExists xx \\rightarrow \\neg(u \\prec xx))\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\EExists xx\\) and \\(\\EExists u\\) are suitable formalizations\nof the claims that respectively \\(xx\\) and \\(u\\)\n exist.[10]\n",
