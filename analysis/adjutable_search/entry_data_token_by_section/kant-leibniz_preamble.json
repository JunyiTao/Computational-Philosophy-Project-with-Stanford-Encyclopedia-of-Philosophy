    "main_text": "\n\nKant\u2019s interest in the physics, metaphysics, epistemology, and\ntheology of his predecessor G.W. Leibniz is evident in his writings in\nthe philosophy of natural science as well as in the passages of the\nCritique of Pure Reason dealing with transcendental ideas and\nhis essays on history and progress. The conventional view that Kant\nsought to steer a middle course between the rationalism of\n18th century German school philosophy initiated by\nLeibniz\u2019s follower Christian Wolff and the empiricism of David\nHume furnishes a useful point of departure for understanding\nKant\u2019s intellectual context and his aims and intentions.\nHowever, Kant\u2019s aim in propounding his critical philosophy was\nnot merely to transcend the stalemate of dogmatism vs. skepticism in\ngeneral epistemology, but to address what he regarded as a crisis: the\ninability of metaphysics, as taught in the Universities, to secure the\nmeta-ethical objectivity of morality and the threat to human\nconfidence and moral discipline posed by the atheism, materialism, and\nfatalism of contemporary forms of naturalism. Kant took\nLeibniz\u2019s as a failed dogmatic enterprise in metaphysics and\nphilosophical theology, but as one that was partially redeemed by its\nparallel treatment of nature and value. He addressed the Leibnizian\ntopics of the nature of substance, the human soul and its powers,\nspace, time, and forces, mechanism and teleology, and divine creation\nin passages scattered throughout his major and minor writings.\n\nThe main features of Kant\u2019s reception of Leibniz are surveyed\nbelow under separate headings.\n",
