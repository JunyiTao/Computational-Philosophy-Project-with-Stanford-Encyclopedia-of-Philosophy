    "main_text": "Replacement\n4. Replacement\n\n\nMany who take an embodied perspective on cognition believe that the\ncommitments of traditional cognitive science must be jettisoned and\nreplaced with something else. No more computation, no more\nrepresentation, no more manipulation of symbols. Researchers who\npromote the complete replacement of traditional cognitive science tend\nto show the influence of ecological psychology. Less radical are\narguments for abandoning some elements of traditional cognitive\nscience, for instance the idea that cognition is a product of\nrule-guided inference, while retaining others, e.g., the idea that\ncognition still involves representational states. This position has\nroots in the connectionist alternative to computationalism discussed\nin \u00a71.2. Support for Replacement arrives from several\ndirections.\n",
