Boethius and the Latin Tradition\n\nBeginning some time in the fourth century CE, Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon established itself as part of the reading curriculum\nin the Latin tradition. Like the Greek tradition, the Latin tradition\nemployed a great variety of exegetical tools in the teaching of\nAristotle: paraphrases, elementary as well as more advanced\ncommentaries. In addition, the Latin tradition was confronted with the\nspecific problem of providing the students with adequate translations\nof the relevant texts.\n\nThe tradition credits Marius Victorinus (fourth century CE) with a\ntranslation of the Categories, the De\nInterpretatione, and Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\n(Cassiodorus, Instit. II, 3, 18). The same tradition credits\nhim with a commentary in eight books on the Categories. A few\nyears later Vettius Agorius Praetextatus is known to have translated\nthe Greek paraphrases of the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics produced by Themistius (Boethius, De\nInt.2 3.6\u20134.3). None of these works have reached\nus, with the exception of excerpts from Victorinus\u2019 translation\nof the Isagoge. An anonymous paraphrase of the\nCategories falsely attributed to Augustine and traditionally\nknown as Categoriae Decem has survived only because it was\nwidely read and used in the early Middle Ages. Finally, an incomplete\nparaphrase of the Categories is preserved in Martianus\nCapella\u2019s On Dialectic (the forth book of his The\nMarriage of Philosophy and Mercury, an influential textbook on\nthe seven liberal arts dating from the fifth century CE). Even these\nfew remarks suffice to document a sustained effort to provide the\nstudents with a Latin Organon that reflected the teaching\nneeds of the time.\n\nThe key figure for the reception of Aristotle in the Latin world was\nBoethius. Best known for his Consolation of Philosophy,\nBoethius (ca 475\u2013526) was the transmitter of the\nAristotelian logical tradition to the early Middle Ages. His attitude\nto the text of Aristotle and Plato was not different from that of the\nother commentators of Late Antiquity. He regarded Plato and Aristotle\nas philosophical authorities and was persuaded that the best way to do\nphilosophy was to read and comment on their works. Like the Platonists\nof Late Antiquity, he was convinced that Plato and Aristotle were in\nbasic agreement, and that Aristotle\u2019s thought was to be\nunderstood as a genuine development of Plato\u2019s. In this frame of\nmind, Boethius planned to translate all the works of Aristotle that he\ncould find along with all the dialogues of Plato, and to comment on\nall of them in order to show that Plato and Aristotle agreed on the\nmost significant philosophical points (Boethius De\nInt.2 79. 9\u201380.9).\n\nBoethius was able to execute this plan only in part. He managed to\ntranslate the Categories, the De Interpretatione,\nthe Prior Analytics, the Topics and the\nSophistical Refutations. In addition, he translated\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge. Boethius produced two commentaries\non the Isagoge. Along with these commentaries, he\nwrote two commentaries on the De Interpretatione.\n\nThe practice of writing double commentaries is to be understood in the\nlight of the concern for pedagogy that motivates the entire commentary\ntradition. Here is how Boethius explains why he wrote two commentaries\n(or rather two versions of the same commentary) on the De\nInterpretatione:\n\nIt has been my plan to disclose Aristotle\u2019s subtlest doctrines\nin a commentary organized in two versions; for what the first version\ncontains prepares, to some extent, an easier path for those who are\nentering into these more profound and subtle matters. But because the\nsecond version develops in connection with the expositor\u2019s\nsubtler doctrines, it is presented to be read and studied by those who\nare advanced in this inquiry and study (Boethius, In De\nInt.2 186. 2\u20139 after Kretzmann).\n\n\nBoethius also wrote a commentary on the Categories. This\ncommentary was intended to be an elementary exposition of the\ntreatise. Boethius planned to write a second exposition, addressed to\nmore advanced students (Boethius In Cat. 160 A-B). It is just\nunclear whether he was able to produce this more advanced commentary.\n(For further information on Boethius as a commentator, see Section 2\nof the entry on\n Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius.)\n\nThe exegetical labor on the Isagoge, the Categories\nand the De Intepretatione continued after Boethius. This\nlabor took often the form of glosses, that is, annotations written in\nmargin of copies of the Isagoge, the Categories and\nthe De Interpretatione. A survey of the exegetical results\nreached in the early Latin Medieval tradition goes beyond the scope of\nthis entry. I refer the reader to the Bibliography for further reading\non the commentary tradition in the early Middle Ages.\n",
