    "main_text": "Relevance Theory\n12. Relevance Theory\n\nThe most influential alternative to Gricean and neo-Gricean theory,\ncalled \u201cRelevance theory\u201d, was developed by Sperber and\n Wilson.[54]\n\n\nWe have proposed a definition of relevance and suggested what factors\nmight be involved in assessments of degrees of relevance. We have also\nargued that all Grice\u2019s maxims can be replaced by a single\nprinciple of relevance\u2014that the speaker tries to be as relevant\nas possible in the circumstances\u2014which, when suitably\nelaborated, can handle the full range of data that Grice\u2019s\nmaxims were designed to explain. (Wilson & Sperber 1986: 381)\n\n\n\u201cRelevance\u201d is given a highly technical sense, in which\nthe relevance of a proposition in a context is directly related to how\nmany positive cognitive effects it has and inversely related to how\nmuch effort is required to process it (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 6,\n62\u20133,\n 219).[55]\n \u201cPositive cognitive effects\u201d are \u201cimprovements in\nknowledge\u201d, including \u201ctrue contextual implications, or\nwarranted strengthenings or weakenings of existing assumptions\u201d.\nContextual implications are propositions logically implied by the\nproposition and the cognitive context together but from neither alone.\nPropositions or assumptions are objects of belief or\nknowledge\u2014cognitive representations. Wilson and Sperber\nillustrate their concept by imagining a doctor whose choice of true\nstatements is confined to the alternatives in (14).\n\n(14)\n \na. You are ill.\nb. You have the flu.\nc. You have the flu or 29 is the square root of 843.\n\n\n\nThey conclude that [14b] would be maximally relevant on the grounds\nthat it entails everything [14a] does and more, while being as easy to\nprocess; [14c] has the same cognitive effects as\n [14b],[56]\n but is harder to process.\n\nExample (14) is a special case in that either the effects or the\neffort are equal between alternative contributions. To know what is\nmaximally relevant in other cases, a particular function of effects\nand effort must be specified (Hinkelman 1987). Sperber and Wilson\nspecify one when describing the theory of cognition on which they\nground their theory of communication. \u201cOur claim is that all\nhuman beings automatically aim at the most efficient information\nprocessing possible\u201d (Sperber & Wilson 1986a: 49).\n\u201cEfficiency in cognition \u2026 involves processing inputs\nthat offer the best possible cost/benefit ratio at the\ntime\u201d(Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n 62).[57]\n Selecting this function and formulating a principle in the style of\nGrice\u2019s yields:\n\n\nPrinciple of Maximal Relevance (Cognitive\nEfficiency): Contribute that which has the maximum ratio of\npositive cognitive effects to processing\n cost.[58]\n\n\nWe will see that Relevance theorists qualify this idea, but many\nimportant points can be made with the simpler principle.\n\nWhile Grice\u2019s maxims enjoin the speaker to contribute the\nrequired information and do so perspicuously and briefly, they do not\nrequire the speaker to maximize information, perspicuity, or brevity\nwhen other things are equal. For example, Grice\u2019s maxims do not\npredict that Barb implicated I am not going anywhere in\n (1)\n even though it is more informative than I am not going to\nPeter\u2019s party, and may have a greater effects/cost ratio.\nOr suppose that in a discussion of a new prescription drug benefit,\nsomeone comments \u201cIt will take some money to fund that\nprogram\u201d. The speaker would normally be engaging in\nunderstatement, implicating \u201cThe program will be very\nexpensive\u201d. Relevance theorists account for this by saying that\nbecause the proposition explicitly conveyed is trivial, and thus has\nfew positive cognitive effects, the hearer will \u201crecover\u201d\nthe more informative\n proposition.[59]\n Critics respond that countless propositions are more informative than\nthe one implicated, such as \u201cThe program will cost\ntrillions\u201d, and seem as easy to process.\n [60]\n\nConversely, Maximal Relevance does not imply or subsume Grice\u2019s\nprinciples. For instance, nothing guarantees that the contribution\nwith the most positive cognitive effects per unit processing cost is\ngermane to the topic of the conversation or as informative as required\n(less informative contributions might have more positive cognitive\neffects per unit processing cost). As a result, Maximal Relevance does\nnot predict what Barb implicated in example\n (1).\n The proposition I am not going to Peter\u2019s party will\nhave different effects than I am not going to Paul\u2019s\nparty, but seems as easy to process and could well have as many\npositive cognitive\n effects.[61]\n Only the proposition about Paul is relevant in the ordinary sense to\nwhat Alan asked, but this does not entail that it is maximally\nrelevant in the technical sense of Relevance\n theory.[62]\n\nSperber and Wilson observe that Gricean theory provides no explanation\nfor why Don would say in\n (2)\n that the weather is lovely if he wanted to express the opposite\n belief.[63]\n Maximal Relevance has the same problem: Don\u2019s simply saying\nwhat he means would seem easier to process and thus more efficient.\nWilson & Sperber (2004: 621) think saying something in order to\nmean the opposite would be \u201cpatently irrational\u201d. Adler\n(1987: 710) observed, however, that it need not be irrational given\nhow readily hearers recognize when speakers do so. Moreover, speakers\nengaging in irony are doing more than meaning the opposite of what\nthey said. As Grice (1978: 53\u20134) later recognized, they are also\npretending to mean and assert what they\n said,[64]\n and are expressing more than disbelief of what is said. Sperber and\nWilson call it a \u201cdissociative attitude\u2014wry, skeptical,\nbitter, or\n mocking\u201d.[65]\n Hearers readily recognize and commonly enjoy the performance of this\ncomplex speech act. The observation that irony involves expressing a\ndissociative attitude does not lessen the theoretical problem,\nhowever. There is no reason to think, for example, that \u201cThe\nweather is terrible and anyone who thinks it lovely is foolish\u201d\nhas the maximum effects/cost ratio. Processing just what Don actually\nsaid (that the weather is lovely) would seem to require even less\neffort; so that proposition could conceivably have a greater\neffect/cost ratio. And there is no reason to think an ironic\ninterpretation has a greater effect/cost ratio than a hyperbolic or\nmeiotic interpretation. If expressing a dissociative attitude involves\nsomething other than expressing a proposition, as seems plausible (cf.\nM. S. Green 2018: \u00a75), it would not be a positive cognitive\neffect as defined, and thus would not affect the relevance ratio. For\nreasons such as these, Levinson (1989: 463\u20134) charged that the\naccounts offered by Relevance theorists are as ex post facto\nas Gricean accounts.\n\nThe explanations of loose use offered by Relevance theorists are\nproblematic in another way. In\n (8),\n where Mike said \u201cDinner will be at six\u201d, they explain why\nMike did not say something true like \u201cDinner will be at six or\nshortly after\u201d by saying that the strictly false statement has\nthe same positive cognitive effects but is easier to process and so\nmore\n relevant.[66]\n But that would erroneously imply that Mike did not mean and\nimplicate that dinner will be at six or shortly after.\nAnother reason the explanation is unsatisfactory is that there are\nother things Mike did not say with the same positive contextual\neffects that seem as easy to process as \u201cDinner will be\nat six\u201d. including \u201cDinner will be\naround six\u201d. This proposition has some true cognitive\neffects that \u201cDinner will be at six\u201d lacks, including\n\u201cDinner may not be exactly at six\u201d.\n\nThe recital example in\n \u00a710\n illustrates one reason why Relevance theories adopt Optimal rather\nthan Maximal Relevance (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 64\u20135):\n\n\nthe communicator is manifestly limited by her own abilities (to\nprovide appropriate information, and to present it in the most\nefficient way). Nor can she be expected to go against her own\npreferences (e.g., against the goal she wants to achieve in\ncommunicating, or the rules of etiquette she wishes to follow).\n\n\nHowever:\n\n\nSince it is also manifest that the audience will tend to pay\nappropriate attention only to an utterance that seems relevant enough,\nit is manifest that the communicator wants her audience to assume that\nthe utterance is indeed relevant enough. There is thus a minimal level\nof relevance that the audience is encouraged to expect: the utterance\nshould be relevant enough to be worth the effort needed for\ncomprehension.\n\nRelevance theorists thus propose that every utterance conveys a\npresumption of its own optimal relevance, defined by (a) and (b):\n\n\nPresumption of Optimal Relevance:\n  \na.\nThe utterance is relevant enough to be worth processing.\nb.\nIt is the most relevant one compatible with the\ncommunicator\u2019s abilities and\n preferences.[67]\n \n\n\nBecause of its preference provision, Optimal Relevance does not clash\nwith Politeness and Style the way Maximal Relevance does. The parents\nmay say \u201cYour performance wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d rather\nthan \u201cIt was horrendous\u201d because they strongly prefer not\nto hurt their daughter\u2019s\n feelings.[68]\n This means, however, that Optimal Relevance would not predict that\nBarb meant I am not going to Paul\u2019s party in\n (1)\n even if it is relevant enough to process and more relevant than the\nother alternatives. For Barb might have preferred to dodge\nAlan\u2019s question. In\n (2),\n Don may have preferred an ironic utterance to ones with higher E/C\nratios (Millikan 1987: 725).\n\nWe are focusing on Relevance theory as an alternative attempt to\npredict and explain what speakers implicate. The main focus of\nRelevance theorists, however, is the process by which hearers\ninterpret utterances. The hearer\u2019s aim, on their view,\nis \u201cto find an interpretation of the speaker\u2019s meaning\nthat satisfies the presumption of optimal relevance\u201d. They infer\nthat the hearer \u201cshould follow a path of least effort, and stop\nat the first overall interpretation that satisfies his expectations of\nrelevance\u201d (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 7). It is unclear how to\nreconcile this with requirement that the optimally relevant utterance\nbe the most relevant one compatible with the communicator\u2019s\nabilities and preferences.\n\nThe ratio of positive cognitive effects to processing cost is zero\nwhen there are no positive cognitive effects at all. Given the\ndefinition of contextual implication, any proposition that is part of\nthe cognitive context has no contextual implications. So both Maximal\nand Optimal Relevance seem to imply that speakers cannot mean or\nimplicate anything already known, and must mean something else. Gerrig\n(1987: 718) and McCawley (1987: 724) find this implausible. If A and B\nare walking in torrential rain, A might well say \u201cIt is raining\nreally hard\u201d, stating the obvious, and B might respond\n\u201cThere is indeed some rain coming down\u201d, engaging in\nunderstatement and implicating exactly what A said.\n\nMany critics have observed, and Sperber and Wilson have acknowledged,\nthat relevance as defined is not\n measurable.[69]\n Positive cognitive effects are non-denumerable. Anything a speaker\nmight say or implicate will have infinitely many true contextual\nimplications if it has\n any.[70]\n We do not know whether processing cost is measured by time, mental\neffort, electro-chemical energy, inferential steps, or some function\nof them all. We have no unit of measurement for mental effort, and do\nnot yet know how to measure the energy consumed in processing an\nutterance. If relevance is not well defined and knowable, it cannot be\nused to account for specific implicatures.\n",
