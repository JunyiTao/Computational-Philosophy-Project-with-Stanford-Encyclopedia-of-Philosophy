    "main_text": "Ethics || The Virtues\n7.1 The Virtues\n\nBut while moral virtue is possible even for the pagan, moral virtue is\nnot by itself enough for salvation. Salvation requires not just virtue\n(the opposite of which is moral vice) but merit (the opposite of which\nis sin), and merit requires grace, a free gift from God. In short,\nthere is no necessary connection between virtue\u2014moral\ngoodness\u2014and salvation. Ockham repeatedly emphasizes that\n\u201cGod is a debtor to no one\u201d; he does not owe us\nanything, no matter what we do.\n\nFor Ockham, acts of will are morally virtuous either extrinsically,\ni.e. derivatively, through their conformity to some more fundamental\nact of will, or intrinsically. On pain of infinite regress, therefore,\nextrinsically virtuous acts of will must ultimately lead back to an\nintrinsically virtuous act of will. That intrinsically virtuous act of\nwill, for Ockham, is an act of \u201cloving God above all else and\nfor his own sake.\u201d\n\nIn his early work, On the Connection of the Virtues, Ockham\ndistinguishes five grades or stages of moral virtue, which have been\nthe topic of considerable speculation in the secondary\n literature:[48]\n\nThe first and lowest stage is found when someone wills to act in\naccordance with \u201cright reason\u201d\u2014i.e., because it is\n\u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\nThe second stage adds moral \u201cseriousness\u201d to the\npicture. The agent is willing to act in accordance with right reason\neven in the face of contrary considerations, even\u2014if\nnecessary\u2014at the cost of death.\nThe third stage adds a certain exclusivity to the motivation; one\nwills to act in this way only because right reason requires\nit. It is not enough to will to act in accordance with right reason,\neven heroically, if one does so on the basis of extraneous, non-moral\nmotives.\nAt the fourth stage of moral virtue, one wills to act in this way\n\u201cprecisely for the love of God.\u201d This stage \u201calone\nis the true and perfect moral virtue of which the Saints\nspeak.\u201d\nThe fifth and final stage can be built immediately on either the\nthird or the fourth stage; thus one can have the fifth without the\nfourth stage. The fifth stage adds an element of extraordinary moral\nheroism that goes beyond even the \u201cseriousness\u201d of stage\ntwo.\n\n\nThe difficulty in understanding this hierarchy comes at the fourth\nstage, where it is not clear exactly what moral factor is\nadded to the preceding three\n stages.[49]\n",
