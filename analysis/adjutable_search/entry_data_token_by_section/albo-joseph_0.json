    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nThe known details of Albo\u2019s life are sparse. As far as we know,\nhe was born in Christian Spain in the crown of Aragon around 1380, and\ndied in the crown of Castile around 1444. In documenting the\nhighlights of his career, we should first mention his period of study\nin the school of Hasdai Crescas in Saragossa. Further, in\n1413\u20131414 he played a dominant role in the Disputation at\nTortosa, a major public polemic between the Jewish convert to\nChristianity Geronimo de Santa Fe (formerly Joshua Lorki), who\nrepresented the pope, and delegates from many Jewish communities in\nChristian Spain. In this debate, Albo represented the Jewish community\nof Daroca in Aragon (Graetz 1894, 179\u2013220; Baer 1961,\n170\u2013232; Rauschenbach 2002, 11\u201347). After this community\nwas decimated in 1415, he moved to the town of Soria in Castile\n(Gonzalo Maeso 1971, 131; Motis Dolader 1990, 148). But Albo is mainly\nknown for his philosophical treatise,\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, which he finished around 1425. Aside from\nacting as a philosopher and spiritual leader, Albo served as a\npreacher and possibly also as a physician. Apparently, Albo had a\ncommand of Spanish and Latin in addition to Hebrew, the language of\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim (Husik 1928\u201330, 67), but we cannot\ndetermine his level of fluency in Arabic.\n",
