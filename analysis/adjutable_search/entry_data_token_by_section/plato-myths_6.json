    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s myths in the Platonist tradition\n7. Plato\u2019s myths in the Platonist tradition\n\nAristotle admits that the lover of myths is in a sense a lover of\nwisdom (Metaphysics 982b18; cf. also 995a4 and\n1074b1\u201310). He might have used a myth or two in his early\ndialogues, now lost. But in general he seems to have distanced himself\nfrom myth (cf. Metaphysics 1000a18\u20139).\n\nOn the philosophical use of myth before Plato there are a number of\ngood studies, notably Morgan 2000. There is, however, little on the\nphilosophical use of myth in the Platonist tradition. Of Plato\u2019s\nimmediate successors in the Academy, Speusippus, Xenocrates and\nHeraclides of Pontus composed both dialogues and philosophical\ntreatises. But, with one exception, none of these seems to have used\nmyths as Plato did. The exception is Heraclides, who wrote various\ndialogues\u2014such as On the Things in Hades,\nZoroastres and Abaris\u2014involving mythical\nstories and mythical, or semi-mythical, figures. In the later\nPlatonist tradition\u2014with the exception of Cicero and\nPlutarch\u2014there is not much evidence that Plato\u2019s\nphilosophical use of myths was an accepted practice. In the\nNeoplatonic tradition various Platonic myths became the subject of\nelaborate allegorization. Porphyry, Proclus, Damascius and\nOlympiodorus gave allegorical interpretations of a number of Platonic\nmyths, such as the Phaedo and Gorgias eschatological\nmyths, or the myth of Atlantis.\n\nFor the influence of Plato\u2019s myths on various thinkers (Bacon,\nLeibniz, the German Idealists, Cassirer and others) see Keum\n(2020).\n",
