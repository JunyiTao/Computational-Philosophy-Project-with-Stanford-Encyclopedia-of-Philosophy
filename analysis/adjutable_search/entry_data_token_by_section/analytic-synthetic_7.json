Right from the start there was, of\ncourse, the problem of the logical truths themselves. Simply saying,\nas Frege had, that they are \u201cLaws of Truth\u201d doesn\u2019t\nseem to explain how we could know them a priori. But perhaps\nthey, too, are \u201canalytic\u201d involving perhaps some sort of\n\u201cimplicit\u201d acceptance of certain rules merely by virtue of\naccepting certain patterns of reasoning. But any such proposal has to\naccount for people\u2019s frequent, often apparent violations of\nrules of logic in fallacious reasoning and in ordinary speech, as well\nas of disputes about the laws of logic of the sort that are raised,\nfor example, by mathematical intuitionists, who deny the Law of\nExcluded Middle (\u201cp or not p\u201d), or, more recently, by\n\u201cpara-consistent\u201d logicians, who argue for the toleration\neven of contradictions to avoid certain\n paradoxes.[7]\n Moreover, given that the infinitude of logical truths needs to be\n\u201cgenerated\u201d by rules of inference, wouldn\u2019t that be\na reason for regarding them as \u201csynthetic\u201d in Kant\u2019s\nsense (see Frege 1884 [1980], \u00a788, Katz 1988, pp. 58\u20139, and\nMacFarlane 2002)?\n\nMuch more worrisome is a challenge raised by Quine (CLT, \u00a7II):\neven if certain logical truths seemed undeniable, how does claiming\nthem to be analytic differ from claiming them to be simply\n \u201cobvious\u201d?[8]\n\n\nConsider\u2026the logical truth \u201cEverything is\nself-identical\u201d, \u201c(x)(x = x)\u201d. We can say that it\ndepends for its truth on traits of the language (specifically on the\nusage of \u201c=\u201d), and not on traits of its subject matter;\nbut we can also say, alternatively, that it depends on an obvious\ntrait, viz., self-identity, of its subject matter, viz., everything.\nThe tendency of [my] present reflections is that there is no\ndifference. (CLT, p. 113)\n\n\nPressing the point more deeply:\n\n\nI have been using the vaguely psychological word \u201cobvious\u201d\nnon-technically, assigning it no explanatory value. My suggestion is\nmerely that the linguistic doctrine of elementary logical truth\nlikewise leaves explanation unbegun. I do not suggest that the\nlinguistic doctrine is false and some doctrine of ultimate and\ninexplicable insight into the obvious trait of reality is true, but\nonly that there is no real difference between these two\npseudo-doctrines. (CLT, p. 113)\n\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, this is the seed for the challenge that continues\nto haunt proposals about the analytic to this day: what explanatory\ndifference is there between \u201canalytic\u201d claims and simply\nwidely and firmly held beliefs, such as that The earth has existed\nfor many years or There have been black dogs?\nWe\u2019ll consider some proposals \u2014and their problems\u2014\nin due course, but it\u2019s important to bear in mind that, if no\ndifference can be sustained, then it\u2019s difficult to see the\nsignificance of the logicist program or of the claims of (strictly)\n\u201canalytic\u201d philosophy generally.\n\nThe most immediately calamitous challenge to Logicism was, however,\nthe famous paradox Russell raised for one of Frege\u2019s crucial\naxioms, his prima facie plausible \u201cBasic Law V\u201d\n(sometimes called \u201cthe unrestricted Comprehension Axiom\u201d),\nwhich had committed him to the existence of a set for every predicate.\nBut what, asked Russell, of the predicate x is not a member of\nitself? If there were a set for that predicate, that set itself\nwould be a member of itself if and only if it wasn\u2019t;\nconsequently, there could be no such set. Therefore Frege\u2019s\nBasic Law V couldn\u2019t be true (but see Frege\u2019s Theorem\nand Foundations for Arithmetic for ways to rescue something close\nto logicism, discussed in \u00a75 below).\n\nWhat was especially upsetting about Russell\u2019s paradox was that\nthere seemed to be no intuitively satisfactory way to repair set\ntheory in a way that could lay claim to being as obvious and/or merely\na matter of logic or meaning in the way that Frege and the Positivists\nhad hoped. Various proposals were made, but all of them seemed simply\ntailor-made to avoid the paradox, and seemed to have little\nindependent appeal (although see Boolos, 1971, for a defense of the\n\u201citerative\u201d notion of set). Certainly none of them\nappeared to be analytic. Indeed, as Quine notes:\n\n\nWhat we do [in set theory] is develop one or another set theory by\nobvious reasoning, or elementary logic, from unobvious first\nprinciples which are set down, whether for good or for the time being,\nby something like convention. (CLT, p. 111)\n\n",
