Hume\u2019s Evaluation of Newton\n\nThis section analyzes Hume\u2019s relationship to the public Newton\nand other early interpreters of Newton as available to Hume. The\nanalysis reveals that Hume is more critical of and less indebted to\ncore elements of Newton\u2019s philosophy than commonly thought. A\nbenefit of this analysis is that many interpretive debates over how to\nunderstand Hume\u2019s philosophy can be reformulated clearly and\nwith fewer anachronisms.\n\nHume\u2019s explicit reflections on Newton\u2019s writings and\ncharacter reveal a more ambivalent picture than commonly thought: Hume\nshows respect, even admiration for Newton\u2019s achievements, but he\nalso expresses reservations. Behind this ambivalence one can find\nserious philosophic objections to Newton\u2019s life and project.\nThis section looks, first, at Hume\u2019s brief discussions of\nNewton\u2019s life and achievements and, then, analyzes the aims\nbehind Hume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d.\n\nHume does not doubt the longevity of Newton\u2019s intellectual\nachievement: \n\n\nThe severest scrutiny, which NEWTON\u2019S theory has undergone,\nproceeded not from his own countrymen, but from foreigners; and if it\ncan overcome the obstacles, which it meets with at present in all\nparts of Europe, it will probably go down triumphant to the latest\nposterity. (\u201cOf the Rise and Progress of the Arts and\nSciences\u201d, EMPL 121) \n\n\nBut elsewhere, when Hume comments more directly on Newton, there are\nsigns of ambivalence: \n\n\nWere we to distinguish the Ranks of Men by the Genius and Capacity\nmore than by their Virtue and Usefulness to the Public, great\nPhilosophers would certainly challenge the first Rank, and must be\nplac\u2019d at the Top of human Kind. So rare is this Character,\nthat, perhaps, there has not, as yet, been above two in the World, who\ncan lay a just Claim to it. At least, Galileo and Newton seem to me so\nfar to excel all the rest. (\u201cOf the Middle Station of\nLife\u201d, EMPL 550) \n\n\nAccording to Hume, Newton has unusual philosophic talent. Yet, the\nbackhanded nature of Hume\u2019s compliment is unmistakable.\nNewton\u2019s work is not characterized by its virtue; the\nachievements of Newton\u2019s philosophy are not very useful to the\nrest of mankind. For Hume there is a moral point of view from which\nNewton\u2019s achievements may seem less than entirely\npraiseworthy.\n\nThis ambivalence about Newton is not an isolated incident in\nHume\u2019s writings. In the last volume of The History of\nEngland, Hume writes:\n\n\nIn Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and\nrarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies. From modesty, ignorant of his superiority above the rest of\nmankind; and thence, less careful to accommodate his reasonings to\ncommon apprehensions: More anxious to merit than to acquire fame: He\nwas, from these causes, long unknown to the world; but his reputation\nat last broke out with a lustre, which scarcely any writer, during his\nown life-time, had ever before attained. (HE VI, 542)\n\n\nIn this passage, Hume singles out Newton as the \u201cgreatest\ngenius\u201d (no mention of Galileo this time). Hume is following\nFontenelle\u2019s interpretation of Newton as a modest genius not\nconcerned with acquiring fame (Fontenelle 1728\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources\n below). But again, Hume\u2019s praise is not entirely\nstraightforward. It turns out that part of Newton\u2019s achievement\nis due to his failure to possess two kinds of self-knowledge: Newton\ndid not understand how much smarter he was than others and Newton did\nnot understand how far removed from ordinary people\u2019s concerns\nhis theories were. Hume implies that if Newton had been more\nself-aware and more attuned to the environment in which he was\nwriting, he would have been more likely to adjust his mode of\nreasoning to public prejudice. On Hume\u2019s account Newton did not\nproperly understand his relationship to his readership and,\nparadoxically, this partly accounts for Newton\u2019s success. It\nseems not to have occurred to Hume that Newton\u2019s mode of\npresentation in the Principia was a deliberate one to avoid\ncontroversy with those who could not follow its intricate geometric\narguments\u2014an intention Newton makes explicit in the introduction\nto Book 3 of the Principia.\n\nMoreover, Hume thinks that in certain other respects, Newton shares in\nthe superstitious prejudices of his time. This shows another sense in\nwhich Hume\u2019s admiration for Newton\u2019s genius is limited.\nWhile defending the stylistic abilities of King James I, Hume\ncomments: \n\n\n[King James I] has composed a commentary on the Revelations, and\nproved the pope to be Antichrist; may not a similar reproach be\nextended to the famous writer Napier; and even to Newton, at a time\nwhen learning was much more advanced than during the reign of James?\nFrom the grossness of its superstitions, we may infer the ignorance of\nan age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an\nindividual, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated by the\nappearance of religion. (HE V, 155) \n\n\nHowever, Hume did not doubt Newton\u2019s religious sincerity: \n\n\nIt is for the same reason, I maintain, that Newton, Locke, Clarke,\netc. being Arians or Socinians, were very sincere in the creed they\nprofest: And I always oppose this argument to some libertines, who\nwill needs have it, that it was impossible, but that these\nphilosophers must have been hypocrites. (NHR 12.23n78)\n\n\nThus, Hume has no doubts about the intellectual quality of\nNewton\u2019s achievements. His reservations are moral even\ntheological in nature. One can distinguish these along a private and a\npublic dimension. Hume thinks that Newton\u2019s life reveals a man\nwith genuine limitations in understanding (let alone transcending)\nhimself and his times. Hume calls into question the moral quality of\nNewton\u2019s works because they do not serve the public interest and\nthey, and the Newtonians that follow him, are infected with\nsuperstitious beliefs (this line of argument is pursued more fully in\nRussell 2008). While Hume\u2019s criticism of Newton as a man are\nrevealing of Hume\u2019s understanding of what it is to be a\nphilosopher, Hume\u2019s criticism of the purpose behind\nNewton\u2019s project ties directly to the anti-Newtonian aims of\nHume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d. This project is viewed by\nmany contemporary scholars, who emphasize Hume\u2019s\n\u201cnaturalism\u201d, as Hume\u2019s equivalent of what one today\nwould call \u201ccognitive science\u201d (Garrett 1997).\n\nWhile Hume admits that Newton was the \u201cgreatest genius\u201d\nthat \u201cever arose for the ornament and instruction of the\nspecies\u201d, he is unwilling to acknowledge Newton\u2019s\n\u201cVirtue\u201d or \u201cUsefulness to the Public\u201d.\nMoreover, Newton\u2019s project lends cover for gross\n\u201csuperstition\u201d. Instead, in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d\nto the Treatise, Hume offers an ambitious alternative\nproject: his \u201cscience of man\u201d. (In EHU 1.12 he calls it a\n\u201ctrue metaphysics\u201d, which battles \u201cabstruse\nphilosophy and metaphysical jargon\u2026mixed up with popular\nsuperstition\u201d. Given Hume\u2019s criticism of Newton, he may\nhave Newton in mind here.) Hume emphasizes the foundational nature of\nthis project:\n\n\nThere is no question of importance, whose decision is not comprised in\nthe science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any\ncertainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In\npretending, therefore, to explain the principles of human nature, we\nin effect propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can\nstand with any security. (THN \u201cIntroduction\u201d, see Boehm\n2016)\n\n\nThe success of Hume\u2019s systematic \u201cscience of man\u201d\nhas a positive and a negative component. On the positive side, \n\n\nIn these four sciences of Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics\n[i.e., political economy], is comprehended almost everything, which it\ncan any way import us to be acquainted with, or which can tend either\nto the improvement or ornament of the human mind. \n\n\nHume makes it absolutely clear where his priorities are: \n\n\nNor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of\nman will do less honour to our native country than the former in\nnatural philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory,\nupon account of the greater importance of that science, as well as the\nnecessity it lay under of such a reformation. \n\n\nIn short, according to Hume his \u201cscience of man\u201d is far\nmore valuable than Newton\u2019s natural philosophy. This is why Hume\nends the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Treatise with the\nclaim that \n\n\nwe may hope to establish\u2026a science [of man], which will not be\ninferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility to any\nother of human comprehension.\n\n\nMoreover, the content of the \u201cscience of man\u201d reveals that\neven the very Newtonian sciences of \n\n\nMathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some\nmeasure dependent on the science of MAN; since they lie under the\ncognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties.\n(THN \u201cIntroduction\u201d) \n\n\nFor Hume the \u201cscience of man\u201d is the\n\u201cfoundational\u201d science because it is presupposed to some\ndegree by all the other sciences (see also Hazony 2014; Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016; Boehm 2016, 2019).\n\nThe details of Hume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d show the\nweakness of our ordinary cognitive capacity; at the same time it\noffers an argument for staying within confines of (potential) ordinary\nexperience. Hume\u2019s cognitive science has a normative consequence\nin that knowledge of it is supposed to reduce the inclination toward\nintellectual overreaching. For, the practitioners of \u201cmitigated\nscepticism\u201d (cf. the \u201cmodest scepticism\u201d of\n\u201cAppendix\u201d to the Treatise) will not \n\n\nbe tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the\nimperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach,\nand their inaccurate operations. (EHU 12.3.25) \n\n\nHume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d constrains the extent of our\ntheorizing. In subsequent sections it will be illustrated how Hume\nreinterprets the limits and content of Newtonian natural philosophy in\nlight of his \u201cscience of man\u201d or \u201ctrue\nmetaphysics\u201d.\n",
