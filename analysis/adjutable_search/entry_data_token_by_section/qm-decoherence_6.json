    "main_text": "Decoherence and the Measurement Problem || Widening the measurement problem\n2.2 Widening the measurement problem\n\nDecoherence is clearly neither a dynamical evolution contradicting the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, nor a new supplementation or interpretation\nof the theory. As we shall discuss, however, it both reveals important\ndynamical effects within the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, and\nmay be suggestive of possible interpretational moves. As such\nit has much to offer to the philosophy of quantum mechanics. At first,\nhowever, it seems that discussion of environmental interactions should\nactually exacerbate the existing problems. Intuitively, if the\nenvironment is carrying out lots of spontaneous measurements even\nwithout our intervention, then the measurement problem ought to apply\nmore widely, also to these spontaneously occurring\nmeasurements.\n\nIndeed, while it is well-known that localised states of macroscopic\nobjects spread very slowly with time under the free Schr\u00f6dinger\nevolution (i.e., if there are no interactions), the situation turns\nout to be different if they are in interaction with the environment.\nAlthough the different components that couple to the environment will\nbe individually incredibly localised, collectively they can have a\nspread that is many orders of magnitude larger. That is, the state of\nthe object and the environment could be a superposition of zillions of\nvery well localised terms, each with slightly different positions, and\nthat are collectively spread over a macroscopic distance,\neven in the case of everyday\n objects.[14]\n Given that everyday macroscopic objects are particularly subject to\ndecoherence interactions, this raises the question of whether quantum\nmechanics can account for the appearance of the everyday world even\napart from the measurement problem.\n\nThere is thus an even wider problem, which we can call the problem of\nthe classical regime of quantum mechanics, and quite analogous\nto the measurement problem. Can quantum mechanics be applied to the\ndescription of classical systems? We can deny it (as orthodox\napproaches do), but then what are classical systems in the first\nplace? And if we apply quantum mechanics also to the systems that seem\nto populate our everyday world, can we derive from quantum\nmechanics the behaviour that is characteristic of such\n\u2018classical\u2019 systems? But such a derivation appears\nimpossible. To put it crudely: if everything is in interaction with\neverything else, everything is generically entangled with everything\nelse, and that is a worse problem than measuring apparatuses being\nentangled with measured systems.\n",
