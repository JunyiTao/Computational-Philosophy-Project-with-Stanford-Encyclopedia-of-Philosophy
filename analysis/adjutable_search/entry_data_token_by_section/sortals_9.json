    "main_text": "Definitions of \u201csortal\u201d || Sortals and individuative terms\n5.2 Sortals and individuative terms\n\nQuine\u2019s terminology in this area differs from that of Strawson,\nWiggins and Geach. In 1960 he uses the expression \u201cterm that\ndivides its reference\u201d, but in other writings (1969, 1981) he\nuses the expression \u201cindividuative word\u201d. In footnote 1 of\nQuine 1960: 90 he says that his expression is equivalent to\nStrawson\u2019s \u201csortal\u201d. Unfortunately, that cannot be\nexactly true since 1960: 91 Quine says that \u201cobject\u201d\ndivides its reference, though we have seen \u201cobject\u201d is not\na sortal by the criteria of Strawson or Wiggins because it does not\nenable counting.\n\nQuine does not give an explicit criteria for determining when a term\n\u201cdivides its reference\u201d, but some have been proposed on\nhis behalf. Wallace (1965) discusses two understandings of the term.\nThe first is\n\nG divides its reference iff it is never the case that if\na is G, a can be divided into two parts which are\nG\n\nWhile this characterizes \u201ccat\u201d as a sortal and\n\u201cobject\u201d as a non-sortal, it also excludes some terms that\nare sortals by the counting criteria, e.g., garden hoses, rocks, piles\nof snow, sand dunes, amoeba and ice cubes. He also discusses the\nconverse: G divides its reference just in case whenever\na and b are G, the result of putting a and\nb together is never G.\n\nThis will get the easy cases right, as above, but also fails on the\nsame problematic list. (Most of these points were made in Feldman\n1973 where he also explores various other ways of modifying these\nprinciples.)\n\nThe closest Quine comes to an explicit formulation of a\ncharacterization is in contrasting individuative terms with mass\nterms:\n\n\nSo-called mass terms like \u201cwater\u201d,\n\u201cfootwear\u201d and \u201cred\u201d have the semantical\nproperty of referring cumulatively: any sum of parts which are water\nis water. (1960: 91)\n\n\nBy \u201csum\u201d here he almost certainly means the mereological\nsum, not the result of physical juxtaposition. This would mean that\n\u201cobject\u201d and \u201cspace time region\u201d would not be\nsortals, but \u201cspatio-temporally continuous object\u201d and\n\u201cspace-time region with volume less than x\u201d are\nsortals. These results may be consistent with Quine\u2019s views\ngiven that he has indicated that he accepts \u201cobject\u201d, but\nthey diverge from the Strawson-Wiggins intent. Note that the three\nterms listed above have some significant differences;\n\u201cwater\u201d refers to a kind of stuff, \u201cfootwear\u201d\nto a kind of thing, and \u201cred\u201d is a property of both stuff\nand things. (See Laycock 2011 and the entry on\n object\n for further discussion.)\n\nIn any event, Quine\u2019s view of the distinction is much more\npragmatic than most. In explaining the distinction he says:\n\n\nThe contrast lies in the terms and not in the stuff they name.\n\u2026consider \u201cshoe\u201d, \u201cpair of shoes\u201d, and\n\u201cfootwear\u201d: all three range over exactly the same stuff,\nand differ from one another solely in that two of them divide their\nreference differently and the third not at all. (1960: 91)\n\n\nEven this characterization of a contrast is dubious if we note that by\nthe last criterion \u201cobject with mass more than 2 kg\u201d is\nnot an individuative term since the sum of any two such objects is\nanother such object, whereas \u201cobject with mass less than 2\nkg\u201d fails the test since the sum of two such objects sometimes\nhas mass over 2 kg. It is difficult to see any important respect in\nwhich the two expressions divide their reference differently. Object\nmore than 2 kg and object less than 2 kg seem to divide their\nreference.\n\nAnother, example, given by Feldman (1973), can be used to illustrate\nthe somewhat capricious nature of the distinction and its language\ndependence. He claims that \u201cfive-foot garden hose\u201d is an\nindividuative term since no part of it is a five-foot garden hose, but\n\u201cgarden hose\u201d is not individuative. The latter claim\nrequires some qualification. If being a garden hose requires a\ncoupling on one end and a nozzle on the other, then the halves of a\ngarden hose are not garden hoses. If being a garden hose requires\nneither a nozzle nor coupling, then each half (indeed each\nnth, up to some n) of a garden hose is a\ngarden hose. If being a garden hose requires a coupling but not a\nnozzle, then one half of a garden hose is a garden hose but the other\nis not. Although the differences may be important to the gardener, it\nis difficult to see anything metaphysically deep here.\n",
