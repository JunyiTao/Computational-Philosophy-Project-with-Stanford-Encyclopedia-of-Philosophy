Ambient Aesthetics and Social Aesthetics\n\nThis attention to atmosphere or ambiance of a certain situation\nconstituted by various ingredients has a long tradition in Japanese\naesthetics (Saito 2005). It was also the main point of the\nassociationist aesthetics advocated by Archibald Alison\n(1757\u20131839). Today ambient aesthetics is garnering a renewed\nattention primarily due to works by Gernot B\u00f6hme who suggests\nthat atmosphere should be the central focus of new aesthetics. In our\ndaily life, we often experience the atmospheric character of a\nsituation: tense or relaxed, cheerful or melancholic, exuberant or\nsubdued, inviting or alienating, electrifying or dull. Sometimes a\ndistinct character of a situation is intentionally orchestrated,\noftentimes in a special occasion like a wedding or a funeral, with\nspecifically selected music, decorations, attire, and choreographed\nmovements, to name a few. Some other times, a unified atmosphere\narises spontaneously when various elements making up the physical\nenvironment and human interactions and movements within it happen to\ncongeal (B\u00f6hme 1993, 1998; Miyahara 2014; di Stefano 2017).\n\nAlthough in our daily life we experience and appreciate (or\ndepreciate) a certain atmosphere or ambiance quite frequently, it has\nnot received adequate attention in the aesthetics discourse primarily\nbecause of the lack of clearly defined and delineated\n\u2018object\u2019 of the experience. Without a clear\n\u2018frame\u2019 around the object of experience, critics suggest,\ninter-subjective discussion of its aesthetics is not possible. Nor are\nthere clear criteria, such as art historical conventions, that are\nhelpful in determining what is and is not a part of the aesthetic\nexperience (Parsons and Carlson 2008). Ambiance, air, or atmosphere is\nindeed subjectively-oriented in the sense that one\u2019s experience\nbecomes colored accordingly. However, it should also be noted that it\nis not purely subjective or private, as claimed by critics, insofar as\nit refers to objectively identifiable features of the environment and\nsituation. Furthermore, some contemporary works of art specifically\naim at creating a certain atmosphere that envelops the audience (Z.\nWang 2018).\n\nAmbient aesthetics also highlights the important role played by\nnon-visual sensory experiences that permeate our lived life. The\nrelevance of the so-called lower senses in everyday aesthetics has\nalready been mentioned (Section 5). However, possibly with an\nexception of the gustatory, non-visual sensory experiences, namely the\nauditory, the olfactory, and the haptic, tend to be eclipsed by the\nvisual, although their contribution to our everyday aesthetic\nexperience is undeniable (Ackerman 1991; Tuan 1993; Brady 2005; Howes\n2014; Korsmeyer 2017; Interference Journal (Issue 7, 2019); Shiner\nforthcoming). Sometimes they enrich an overall ambiance, such as a\ncalming ambient sound and a weather-beaten smooth surface of a\nbuilding, while other times they constitute negative aesthetics, such\nas a blaring car stereo sound and a stench from a nearby factory.\nFurthermore, the lack of sounds and smell may be a welcome relief\nwhile at other times it may render the experience deficient (Drobnick\n2005; Anderson forthcoming). Everyday aesthetics encourages attention\nto these non-visual experiences, which helps sharpen our sensibility.\nAttention to these sensory experiences is also critical in\narchitectural practice and urban planning which tend to be dominated\nby the visual orientation (Pearson 1991; Pallasmaa 1999).\n\nPart of what determines the ambiance or atmosphere is human\ninteractions. The character of such interactions is constituted by the\nparticipants\u2019 personality and relationships with others that are\nsubject to aesthetic considerations. In addition to what one does and\nsays, one can be considered warm, cold, formal, aloof, friendly,\nintimidating, gentle, and so forth, largely due to aesthetic factors\nsuch as tone of voice, way of speaking, facial expression, bodily\ngesture and posture, and outward presentation such as clothing, hair\nstyle, ornamentation, and the like. Sometimes the moral character of\none\u2019s action is assessed by aesthetic dimensions over and beyond\nwhat the action accomplishes. For example, one may gobble up a\nlovingly prepared and meticulously arranged meal carelessly and\nindifferently, or one may take time and savor every bite respectfully\nand mindfully to show one\u2019s appreciation for the cook. One can\nclose a door roughly, making a loud noise and startling others, or one\ncan close it gently and carefully so as not to disturb others.\nFinally, one can help a person in need grudgingly and spitefully or do\nso with care and good cheer (Buss 1999; Sherman 2005; Naukkarinen\n2014; Shusterman 2016; Saito 2016, 2017a).\n\nIn these examples, important desiderata in aesthetic experiences can\nalso be regarded as desirable in human relationships: open-mindedness\nto accept and appreciate diversity, respect and reciprocity, full and\nsincere engagement, among others. Established as a sub-category of\neveryday aesthetics by Arnold Berleant, social aesthetics calls\nattention to the fact that the aesthetics plays a surprisingly and\noften unrecognized role in determining the moral character of actions,\npersons, and human interactions (Berleant 2005b, 2010, 2012,\n2017).\n\nFurthermore, social aesthetics promotes cultivating virtues through\neveryday practice. One\u2019s kindness, compassion, thoughtfulness,\nand respect require appropriate expressions guided by aesthetic\nsensibility and skills, in addition to accomplishing a certain deed.\nHarmonious and cooperative interaction with others also requires not\nonly appropriate cultural knowledge but also aesthetic sensibility to\ndecipher group dynamics and determine how best to help create a\ncertain atmosphere (Naukkarinen 2014). A mere conceptual understanding\nof the importance of aesthetics in these interactions is not\nsufficient. Embodied practice is required to contribute to\naesthetically-minded social interactions.\n",
