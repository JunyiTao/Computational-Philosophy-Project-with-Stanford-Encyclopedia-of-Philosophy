    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry focuses on six major questions concerning the rationality\nand morality of voting:\n\nIs it rational for an individual citizen to vote?\nIs there a moral duty to vote?\nAre there moral obligations regarding how citizens vote?\nIs it justifiable for governments to compel citizens to vote?\nIs it permissible to buy, trade, and sell votes?\nWho ought to have the right to vote, and should every citizen have\nan equal vote?\n\n\nQuestion 6 concerns the broader question of whether democratic forms\nof government are preferable to the alternatives; see Christiano\n(2006) on the justification of democracy for a longer discussion. See\nalso Pacuit (2011) for a discussion of which voting method is best\nsuited to reflect the \u201cwill of the group\u201d. See Gosseries\n(2005) for a discussion of arguments for and against the secret\nballot.\n",
