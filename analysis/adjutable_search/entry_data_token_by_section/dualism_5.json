Varieties of Dualism: Interaction\n\n\nIf mind and body are different realms, in the way required by either\nproperty or substance dualism, then there arises the question of how\nthey are related. Common sense tells us that they interact: thoughts\nand feelings are at least sometimes caused by bodily events and at\nleast sometimes themselves give rise to bodily responses. I shall now\nconsider briefly the problems for interactionism, and its main rivals,\nepiphenomenalism and parallelism.\n",
