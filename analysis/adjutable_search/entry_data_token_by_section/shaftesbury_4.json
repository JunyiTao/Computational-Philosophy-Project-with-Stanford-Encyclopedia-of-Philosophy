    "main_text": "Morality || Virtue and goodness\n2.1 Virtue and goodness\n\nShaftesbury maintains that virtue is the promotion of the good of all\nhumankind.\n\n\nTo love the Publick, to study universal Good, and to promote the\nInterest of the whole World, as far as lies within our power, is\nsurely the Height of Goodness. (C 1.37)\n\n\nThe virtuous person strives to develop an \u201cequal, just, and\nuniversal Friendship\u201d with humanity as a whole (C 2.242). This\nview of virtue is a precursor to Hutcheson\u2019s proto-Utilitarian\nview that \u201cthat Action is best, which procures the greatest\nHappiness for the greatest Numbers\u201d (Hutcheson 1726: 125).\nLevy-Eichel also points to Shaftesbury\u2019s coinage of\n\u201cMoral Arithmetic\u201d (C 2.99) as a crucial part of\nthe pre-history of Utilitarianism, and its use of mathematics in moral\nsubjects (Levy-Eichel 2020). (For further discussion of\nShaftesbury\u2019s influence on Utilitarianism, see Driver 2014. For\na view of Shaftesbury\u2019s differences from later Utilitarians, see\nCrisp 2019: 86).\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s view of virtue is part of his teleological view of\ngoodness. Something is good, according to Shaftesbury, if it\ncontributes to the \u201cExistence or Well-being\u201d of the system\nof which it is a part (C 2.18). Every animal is a part of its species.\nA particular animal, say a tiger, is a good member of its\nspecies\u2014it\u2019s a good tiger\u2014if it contributes to the\nwell-being of the tiger species as a whole. There is also \u201ca\nsystem of all animals,\u201d which consists of the\n\u201corder\u201d or \u201ceconomy\u201d of all the different\nanimal species (C 2.19). A good animal is one that contributes to the\nwell-being of \u201canimal Affairs\u201d in general (C 2.19). The\nsystem of all animals, moreover, works with the system \u201cof\nVegetables, and all other things in this inferior World\u201d to\nconstitute \u201cone system of a Globe or Earth\u201d (C\n2.19). So something is a good earthly thing if it contributes to the\nexistence of earthly things in general. And the system of this earth\nis itself part of a \u201cUniversal System\u201d or\n\u201ca System of all Things\u201d\n(C 2.20). To be \u201cwholly and really\u201d good\na thing must contribute to the good of the universe as a whole (C\n2.20). This progression of ever-larger systems is a bit dazzling, and\nwe might wonder how we can know (or even make sense of) whether\nsomething is contributing to the well-being of the universe as a\nwhole. But Shaftesbury avoids this problem by discussing in detail\nonly that which makes \u201ca sensible Creature\u201d a good member\nof its species\u2014by focusing on whether an individual creature is\npromoting the well-being of its species (C 2.21). Perhaps Shaftesbury\nbelieves that a creature that contributes to the well-being of its\nspecies will also always contribute to the well-being of the universe\nas a whole, in which case being a good member of one\u2019s species\nwould be coextensive with being \u201cwholly and really\u201d\ngood.\n\nThe goodness or evilness of a sensible creature, according to\nShaftesbury, is based on the creature\u2019s motives, and not simply\non the results of the creature\u2019s actions (C 2.21\u201322). (As\nwe will see, this leads to the crucial claims that every motive to\naction involves affection or passion [C 2.40\u201344], and that\nreason alone cannot motivate [C 2.28\u201352, 77\u201381]).\nShaftesbury strongly emphasizes the importance of motive, arguing that\nif creatures promote the good of the species only because they are\nforced to or only because promoting the good is a means to other ends,\nthen they are not actually good themselves. Creatures are good only if\ntheir motivating affections are directed \u201cprimarily and\nimmediately\u201d at the good of the species, not if the\nconnection between their affection and the good of the species is\naccidental (C 2.26).\n\nGoodness is something that is within the reach of all sensible\ncreatures, not only humans but also non-human animals. A creature is\ngood if its affections promote the well-being of the system of which\nit is a part, and non-human animals are just as capable of possessing\nthis type of affection as humans. \u201cVirtue or Merit,\u201d on\nthe other hand, is within the reach of \u201cMan only\u201d\n(C 2.28). That\u2019s because virtue is tied to a special kind of\naffection that only humans possess. This special kind of affection is\na second-order affection, an affection that has as its object another\naffection. We humans experience these second-order affections because\nwe, unlike non-human animals, are conscious of our own passions. Not\nonly do we possess passions, but we also reflect on or become aware of\nthe passions we have. And when we reflect on our own passions, we\ndevelop feelings about them. Imagine you feel the desire to help a\nperson in distress. In addition to simply feeling that desire, you\nbecome aware that you are feeling that desire. When you become aware\nof that, you experience a positive feeling (or \u201cliking\u201d)\ntowards your desire to help. Or imagine you feel the desire to harm a\nperson who has bested you in a fair competition. In addition to simply\nfeeling the desire to harm, you become aware that you are feeling that\ndesire. When you become aware of that, you experience a negative\nfeeling (or \u201cdislike\u201d) towards your desire to harm. These\nare the kinds of phenomena Shaftesbury has in mind when he writes\nthat\n\n\nthe Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their\nContrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects.\nSo that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind\nof Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been\nalready felt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or\nDislike. (C 2.28)\n\n",
