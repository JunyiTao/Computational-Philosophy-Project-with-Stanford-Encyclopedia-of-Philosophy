To clarify the\nphenomenon, we ask what each quantity represents in light of\nLewis\u2019s result, already for simple conditionals.\n5.3.1 Cardinality\n\nLet us start with \\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)\\). Even with a fixed\nprobability assignment over a finite set of worlds, the conditional\nprobability may not correspond to the probability of any set of\nworlds. Let \\(W=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) and let \n\n\\[\\Pr(a)=\\Pr(b)=\\Pr(c)=\u2153.\\]\n\n\nClearly, \n\n\\[\\Pr(a\\mid a\\vee b)=\u00bd.\\]\n\n\nHowever, in the Boolean algebra generated from \\(W\\), no\npossible-worlds proposition gets a probability of \u00bd under\n\\(\\Pr\\). H\u00e1jek (1989) in fact showed that there are more\ndistinct conditional probability values than distinct unconditional\nprobability values, for any finite set of possible worlds \\(W\\) that\nhas at least three worlds with non-zero probability. As pointed out in\n\u00c9gr\u00e9 and Cozic (2011), this result offers a structural\nanalogy with undefinability results in generalized quantifier theory.\n\u201cMost \\(A\\)s are \\(C\\)s\u201d is not definable by applying the\nunrestricted \u201cmost\u201d to first-order definable propositions.\nSimilarly here, we may view the result as showing that in a sentence\nlike \u201cthere is a probability of \u00bd that if \\(A\\) then\n\\(C\\)\u201d, the embedded conditional does not express any\nproposition.\n\nThis result, however, is compatible with the idea that if-clauses\nfundamentally act as restrictors of overt or covert operators (see\nLewis 1975; Kratzer 2012; and\n section 8.1\n below). \u00c9gr\u00e9 and Cozic (2011) use the result to\nvindicate that view, though Charlow (2016) argues that the restrictor\nview is not in itself immune to triviality. Another take on it\nconcerns three-valued approaches. In the three-valued case, the\nassertability of a proposition is naturally viewed as the probability\nof that proposition being true given it has a determinate truth value\n(McDermott 1996). Assuming De Finetti\u2019s scheme for the\nconditional, the assertability of \\(A>C\\) is then equal to the\nprobability that \\(A\\wedge C\\) is true, given that \\(A\\) is true, and\nso to the conditional probability. This derives Adams\u2019 Thesis\nfor simple conditionals. That fact notwithstanding, note that with\n\\(a, b,c\\) as atoms and \\(\\Pr\\) as equiprobable on them, again there\nis no three-valued proposition whose probability is \u00bd for the\nconditional \\(a\\vee b > a\\), if we define a possible world by an\nassignment of one of the three values to atomic propositions (and\nhandle disjunction Strong Kleene style). Rather, if three-valued\nconditionals do express propositions, those propositions then need to\nbe viewed as relations between those worlds where the sentence is true\nand those where it is defined, so again as more complex objects than\nset of worlds (cf. Dubois & Prade 1994 who represent them as\npairs).\n5.3.2 Imaging\n\nConsider now \\(\\Pr(A>C)\\). Assume Stalnaker\u2019s semantics for\n\\(A>C\\); what does the probability of that conditional correspond\nto, if not the conditional probability? D. Lewis (1976) identifies a\nrevision rule he calls imaging. Given \\(\\Pr\\), he defines\n\\(\\Pr\\mkern.1mu'_A\\) to be the imaging under the antecedent, where\n\\(\\Pr\\mkern.1mu'_A(w)=0\\) if \\(w\\) is not an \\(A\\)-world; and if \\(w\\)\nis an \\(A\\)-world, then \\(\\Pr\\mkern.1mu'_A(w)\\) equals \\(\\Pr(w)\\)\naugmented by the sum of the non-\\(A\\) worlds to which \\(w\\) comes\nclosest according to Stalnaker\u2019s selection function. Lewis shows\nthat the probability of Stalnaker\u2019s conditional is the\nprobability of the consequent under imaging by the antecedent. Whereas\nconditioning upon \\(A\\) kills off the non-\\(A\\) worlds and spreads\ntheir mass uniformly over the \\(A\\)-worlds, imaging upon \\(A\\) is a\ndifferent operation, which shifts the weight of non-\\(A\\) worlds\nnon-uniformly to the \\(A\\)-worlds depending on the selection function\n(see\n Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n\n(a) Conditionalization on \\(A\\) results in posterior probabilities\n\\(\\Pr'(u)=\\frac{p}{p+q}\\), \\(\\Pr'(v)=\\frac{q}{p+q}\\) and\n\\(\\Pr'(w)=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n(b) Imaging on \\(A\\) results in posterior probabilities\n\\(\\Pr'(u)=p+r\\), \\(\\Pr'(v)=q\\) and \\(\\Pr'(w)=0\\).\n\n\nFigure 4: Example with \\(W=\\{u,v,w\\}\\)\nand prior probabilities \\(\\Pr(u)=p\\), \\(\\Pr(v)=q\\) and \\(\\Pr(w)=r\\).\nIn the figure a red dashed arrow from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) represents that\n\\(y\\) is the closest \\(A\\)-world to \\(x\\) [An\n extended description of Figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAn example from Edgington (2020) can help to figure out the\ndifference. Assume a stack of 100 straws, out of which 90 are 10 cm\nlong, 1 is 11 cm long, and 9 are 20 cm long. Consider the conditional\n\u201cif the straw is longer than 10 cm, then it is shorter than 15\ncm\u201d. Assume similarity between worlds is set by the closeness in\nlengths between straws. The probability of the set of worlds in which\nStalnaker\u2019s conditional is true is \\(\\nicefrac{91}{100}\\), since\nthe 10-cm-straw worlds and the 11-cm-straw world are such that the\nclosest world in which the straw is longer than 10 cm is indeed a\nworld where it is less than 15 cm. But the conditional probability for\nthe conditional is \\(\\nicefrac{1}{10}\\), since only one of the straws\nthat are 11 cm or 20 cm long is less than 15 cm.\n\nThe upshot of these considerations is that starting from\nStalnaker\u2019s conditional, we can see that its probability is not\nthe conditional probability, but the imaging probability (for more on\nimaging, we refer to G\u00fcnther 2018). Conversely, starting from the\nconditional probability of \\(C\\) given \\(A\\), we have seen that it is\nnot in general equal to the probability of any possible world\nproposition. Importantly, Adams\u2019s Thesis remains coherent for\nsimple conditionals qua definition, because it stipulates\nthat the probability of a conditional sentence is a certain\nconditional probability. However, as an empirical thesis,\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis states a substantive identity between\nquantities defined separately, and we now see better why it should\nfail. Whether Adams\u2019 Thesis holds as a matter of empirical fact\nand even for simple conditionals is still debated. Recent findings, to\nwhich we return in\n section 7,\n suggest that relevance considerations also come into play (Douven\n2016; Skovgaard-Olsen, Singmann, & Klauer 2016).\n5.4 Probabilities for compound conditionals\n\nStalnaker\u2019s Thesis is consistent for simple conditionals, but\nfails for conditionals of arbitrary complexity. A challenge is to\nextend Stalnaker\u2019s Thesis to more or less extended classes of\ncompound conditionals. Several proposals have been made toward that\ngoal. The associated literature is quite technical, however, and we\ngive only a few landmarks here. Important is that all the resulting\nsystems mentioned here conservatively extend Adams\u2019s basic\nlogic, namely system P (i.e., they preserve the same\naxioms for simple conditionals, though not necessarily for compound\nconditionals).\n\nVan Fraassen (1976) extends Stalnaker\u2019s Thesis to right-nested\nconditionals of the form \\(A> (B>C)\\) in which \\(A, B,C\\) are\nBoolean, and to left-nested conditionals \\((A>B)>C\\) with the\nsame restriction, and he can also deal with specific conjunctions and\ndisjunctions of conditionals. Van Fraassen\u2019s proposal involves a\nproduct space construction, relying on so-called Stalnaker-Bernoulli\nmodels, allowing him to assign probabilities to infinite sequences of\nworlds based on standard Stalnaker models. The construction is used in\nStalnaker and Jeffrey (1994) and extended in S. Kaufmann (2009). One\nnoteworthy aspect of the construction is that the probability of\nright-nested conditionals of the form \\(A>(B>C)\\) is not in all\ncases identical to the probability of \\((A\\wedge B) > C\\). McGee\n(1989) on the other hand proposes a distinct construction that does\nnot permit left-nested conditionals, but which is intended to secure\nthe law of import-export for right-nested conditionals (famously, by\ngiving up Modus Ponens for nested conditionals). Both approaches have\nsome probabilistic principles in common, however, for instance\n\n\\[\\Pr(A\\wedge (A>B))=\\Pr(A\\wedge B)\\]\n\n\nholds in both theories. For both approaches, moreover, the associated\nlogics are semantically interpretable starting from Stalnaker\u2019s\npossible world semantics. Bradley (2012) builds on the\nJeffrey-Stalnaker and McGee approaches to show that for simple\nconditionals Adams Thesis can be derived by assigning probabilities to\npairs of worlds, instead of just worlds. The probability of a pair\n\\((w_0,w_1)\\) represents the probability that \\(w_0\\) is the actual\nworld, and that \\(w_1\\) is its selected alternative given the\nantecedent under discussion (note that one needs such probabilities\nfor all potential antecedents). A generalization of this property to\nnested conditionals is outlined, with philosophical emphasis on the\nidea that the probability of a conditional does not depend on a single\nworld, but also on the nonfactual relations of counterfactual\ndependence between worlds.\n\nA related approach to iterated conditionals is based on the so-called\ncoherence approach to probability, coming from de Finetti\u2019s\nbetting view of probability (see Coletti & Scozzafava 1999; Gilio\n2002; Gilio & Sanfilippo 2014; and Pfeifer 2014 for an\nintroduction). The idea is that probability degrees can be attached to\nconditional events so long as they do not violate certain coherence\nconstraints on those bets (no sure losses or \u201cDutch\nbooks\u201d). In this framework the probability of an event is\ndefined in terms of the technical notion of prevision. The prevision\n\\(x\\) attached to \\(A>C\\) corresponds to the fact that\n\n\nfor every real number \\(s\\), you are willing to pay (resp., to\nreceive) an amount \\(sx\\) and to receive (resp., to pay) \\(s\\), or\n\\(0\\), or \\(sx\\), according to whether \\(A\\wedge C\\) is true, or\n\\(A\\wedge\\neg C\\) is true, or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (bet called off),\nrespectively. (Sanfilippo, Gilio, Over, & Pfeifer (2020 notation\nadapted))\n\n\nDepending on independence assumptions concerning basic propositions,\nprevisions can be defined not only for conjunctions of conditionals,\nbut also for various nested conditionals. A recent overview of results\nin that domain appears in Sanfilippo et al. (2020).\n6. Belief Revision Approaches\n\nWhile Stalnaker rendered Ramsey\u2019s suggestion about the role of\n\u201cif \\(A\\)\u201d in terms of closest antecedent world, and Adams\nfocused on the probabilistic interpretation of it, Peter\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1978) introduced a semantics of conditionals that\nuses the Ramsey idea in a direct and purely qualitative way. His\napproach is resolutely epistemic\u2014or more precisely,\ndoxastic\u2014 and it is based on the notion of belief or acceptance.\nPrecursors of this approach were William Harper (1976) and Isaac Levi\n(1977).\n6.1 Belief revision models and the Ramsey test\n\nA belief set over a language \\(L\\) is a set of sentences that\nis closed under a given background logic \\(\\iCn\\) (i.e., a\ntheory in the logician\u2019s sense). A belief revision\nmodel (BRM) is a pair \\(M = \\langle \\cK, *\\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\cK\\) is a set of belief sets over \\(L\\) and *: \\(\\cK \\times L \\to\n\\cK\\) is a belief revision function assigning to every belief set\n\\(K\\) and every sentence \\(A\\) a revised belief set \\(K*A\\). The\nacceptance condition for conditionals at a belief set in a belief\nrevision model is a straightforward formalization of Ramsey\u2019s\ntest: \n\n\\[\\tag{RT} M, K \\Vdash_{acc} A >B \\text{ if and only if } B \\in K*A.\\]\n\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s (1978, 1988: sects. 7.1\u20137.2) initial\nidea was to take conditionals that are accepted at a belief set as\nbeliefs, i.e., as elements of this very belief set. Let us\ncall this G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s Ramsey test: \n\n\\[\\tag{GRT} A >B \\in K (\\text{in } M) \\text{ if and only if } B \\in K*A.\\]\n\n\nPrinciples for the logic of conditionals then fall out directly of the\nfollowing rationality postulates for belief revision introduced by\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1978) and Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and\nMakinson (\u201cAGM\u201d, 1985). Using the abbreviation \\(K+A\\) for\n\\(\\iCn(K\\cup\\{A\\})\\), the eight AGM-postulates read as follows: For\nall belief sets \\(K\\) (in all BRMs \\(M\\)) and all sentences \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\),\n\n\n\n(\\(*\\)1)\n\\(K*A\\) is a belief set.\n(Closure) \n\n(\\(*\\)2)\n\\(A\\in K*A.\\)\n(Success) \n\n(\\(*\\)3)\n\\(K*A\\subseteq K+A.\\)\n(Inclusion) \n\n(\\(*\\)4)\nIf \\(\\neg A\\not\\in K\\), then \\(K+A \\subseteq K*A\\).\n(Vacuity) \n\n(\\(*\\)5)\n\\(K*A = K_{\\bot}\\) only if \\(\\vdash \\neg A\\).\n(Consistency) \n\n(\\(*\\)6)\nIf \\(\\vdash A\\equiv B\\), then \\(K*A = K*B\\).\n(Extensionality) \n\n(\\(*\\)7)\n\\(K*(A\\wedge B) \\subseteq(K*A)+B\\).\n(Superexpansion) \n\n(\\(*\\)8)\nIf \\(\\neg B \\notin K*A\\), then \\((K*A)+B \\subseteq K*(A\\wedge\nB)\\)\n(Subexpansion, Rational Monotonicity)  \n\n\nThe numbering is AGM\u2019s, the names are due to Hansson (1999).\nPostulates (\\(*\\)3) and (\\(*\\)4) taken together say that if the input\n\\(A\\) is consistent with the belief set \\(K\\), then the background\nlogic alone is sufficient to guide belief revision. When (\\(*\\)1) and\n(\\(*\\)2) are present and \\(\\iCn\\) is a monotonic consequence\noperation, (\\(*\\)4) is equivalent to the Preservation\nPrinciple stating that if \\(A\\) is consistent with \\(K\\), then\nall elements of \\(K\\) are preserved in \\(K*A\\):\n\n(Pres)\nIf \\(\\neg A\\not\\in K\\), then \\(K \\subseteq K*A\\). (Preservation)\n\n\nAGM called (\\(*\\)1)\u2013(\\(*\\)6) the basic set of\npostulates. The supplementary postulates (\\(*\\)7) and\n(\\(*\\)8) concern composite belief revisions of the form \\(K*(A\\wedge\nB)\\). The idea is that, if \\(K\\) is to be changed minimally so as to\ninclude two sentences \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), such a change should be\npossible by first revising \\(K\\) with respect to \\(A\\) and then\nexpanding \\(K*A\\) by \\(B\\)\u2014provided that \\(B\\) does not\ncontradict the beliefs in \\(K*A\\).\n\nThe logic of conditionals then mirrors the logic of belief revision:\n(\\(*\\)1) corresponds to RCK, (\\(*\\)2) to ID, (\\(*\\)3) to SM, a\nweakened version of (\\(*\\)4) (viz., if \\(A \\in K\\) and \\(K\\) is\nconsistent, then \\(K \\subseteq K*A\\)) to CS, (\\(*\\)6) corresponds to\nLLE, (\\(*\\)7) to OR and (\\(*\\)8) to RMon. In establishing this logic,\nG\u00e4rdenfors used the following notion of validity: a sentence\n\\(A\\) is valid in a BRM \\(M\\) if there is no consistent \\(K\\in \\cK\\)\nwith \\(\\neg A\\in K\\). A sentence \\(A\\) is valid iff it is valid in\nevery BRM. Arl\u00f3-Costa and Levi (1996) call this notion\nnegative validity and contrast it with a notion of\npositive validity that they argue is preferable: \\(A\\) is\npositively valid in a BRM \\(M\\) if \\(A\\in K\\) for every \\(K\\in\n\\cK\\).\n6.2 G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors (1986; 1988 sects. 7.4\u20137.7) soon noticed that\ncoupling the Ramsey test with the AGM theory of belief revision leads\nto a trivialization, which is in many respects similar to\nLewis\u2019s trivialization (see\n section 5.2).\n\nTriviality Theorem (G\u00e4rdenfors):A belief\nrevision model satisfies the AGM postulates\n (\\(*\\)4)\n and\n (\\(*\\)5)\n and G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s Ramsey Test only if it is trivial in the\nsense that it does not contain any belief set that is logically\ncompatible with three sentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) that are\npairwise inconsistent with each other.\n\n\nA quick and simple proof goes as follows: Suppose for reductio that we\nhave a BRM \\(M = \\langle \\cK, *\\rangle\\) with a belief set \\(K\\in\n\\cK\\) that is logically compatible with three pairwise inconsistent\nsentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). First notice that \n\n\\[B\\in K+(\\neg A\\wedge B) = (K+(A\\vee B))+\\neg A \\subseteq(K+(A\\vee B))*\\neg A,\\]\n\n\nby (\\(*\\)4), and similarly \\(C\\in (K+(A\\vee C))*\\neg A\\). So by\nGRT, \n\n\\[\\neg A > B \\in K+(A\\vee B)\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\neg A > C \\in K+(A\\vee C).\\]\n\n\nSince \\(A\\) is logically stronger than both \\(A\\vee B\\) and \\(A\\vee\nC\\), we have \n\n\\[K+(A\\vee B)\\subseteq K+A\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[K+(A\\vee C)\\subseteq K+A.\\]\n\n\nBut since \\(A\\) is compatible with \\(K\\), \\(K+A \\subseteq K*A\\), by\n(\\(*\\)4). So both \\(\\neg A > B\\) and \\(\\neg A > C\\) are in\n\\(K*A\\). This implies, by GRT again, that both \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are in\n\\((K*A)*\\neg A\\). Since \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are inconsistent with each\nother, the latter belief set is inconsistent, contradicting (\\(*\\)5).\nSo the supposition is impossible.\n\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem was widely perceived as an\nunexpected and somewhat shocking result. Postulate\n (\\(*\\)5)\n can hardly been seen as the culprit, so the triviality theorem was\ninterpreted by G\u00e4rdenfors basically as a conflict between\n (\\(*\\)4)\n or the Preservation Principle on the one hand, and the Ramsey Test on\nthe other. But the reactions to his result were mixed, and no\nconsensus has emerged so far.\n\nA first position, taken by Levi and very much in line with those\ndenying that conditionals have truth values, was that conditionals do\nnot express propositions, but epistemic appraisals, and thus should\nnot be objects of belief and elements of belief sets, but rather\nsentences that can only be accepted. This amounts to rejecting\nGRT.\n\nAnother group of researchers suggested to modify or restrict the\nRamsey test. Solutions of this kind were discussed, amongst others, by\nRott (1986), G\u00e4rdenfors (1987, 1988), Levi (1996: Chapter 2),\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1998) and Nute and Cross (2001).\nArguably, none of these adaptations of the Ramsey test has retained\nthe intuitive appeal of the original idea.\n\nOthers think that the Ramsey test is perfectly all right. Some authors\nargue that the right reaction is to say that conditionals should not\nbe analyzed by AGM-style revisions, but rather by\nupdates in the style of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Members\nof this party include Ryan and Schobbens (1997), Grahne (1998) and\nCrocco and Herzig (2002). Updates in this sense are closely related to\nLewis\u2019s (1976) imaging (see\n section 5.3.2\n above). These operations violate the AGM-postulate (\\(*\\)4) and the\nPrinciple of Preservation, but satisfy the following Monotonicity\ncondition which is immediately entailed by GRT: \n\n\\[\\tag{MON} \\text{If } K_1\\subseteq K_2 \\text{ then } K_1*A \\subseteq K_2*A.\\]\n\n\nRott (2011) defends G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s Ramsey test by showing\nthat it does not create a specific problem for the Preservation\nPrinciple. Its consequence is rather that both preservation of factual\nbeliefs and preservation of flat conditionals entail that there is no\npreservation of right-nested conditionals of depth 2. GRT allows for\nright-nested conditionals if a model for iterated belief revision is\navailable (other compounds of conditionals are more difficult to make\nsense of). It can be shown, for instance, that supposing there is an\natom \\(p\\) on which the believer suspends judgment, the\nconditional \n\n\\[(\\neg A\\vee p)>((\\neg A\\vee \\neg p)>\\neg A)\\]\n\n\nfunctions exactly like the epistemic modal \u201cmight \\(\\neg\nA\\)\u201d: it is believed (or accepted) if and only if \\(A\\) is not\nbelieved. Thus, if our language includes right-nested conditionals,\nthere are no two belief sets \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\) such that \\(K\\) is a\nstrict subset of \\(K'\\). Rott argues that it has simply been a mistake\nto take it for granted that Preservation can and should be transferred\nfrom factual language to languages containing nested conditionals.\n\nDetailed analyses of the dialectics of the situation emerging from\nG\u00e4rdenfors\u2019s triviality theorem can be found in\nLindstr\u00f6m and Rabinowicz (1998), Nute and Cross (2001), and\nArl\u00f3-Costa (2007). An up-to-date discussion of related problems\nis Boylan & Schultheis (forthcoming).\n7. Relevance and Difference-Making\n\nSince MacColl\u2019s and C. I. Lewis\u2019s strictures against\nmaterial implication, there has been an increasing number of voices\narguing that some notion of relevant connection between antecedent and\nconsequent is part of the meaning of conditionals. In the area of\nconditionals, the notion of relevance is claimed by distinct\ntraditions, however, and means slightly different\n things.[9]\n\nOne tradition concerns so-called relevant logics, designed to\nformulate a more demanding notion of implication than Lewis\u2019s\nstrict implication (cf. Meyer & Routley 1973). The idea of\nrelevant implication is based in large part on the idea that the\nantecedent and the consequent of an acceptable conditional \\(A>B\\)\nmust be connected in terms of topics. For example, a\nconditional of the form \\((p \\wedge \\neg p) > q\\) need not be\nvalid, despite having an impossible antecedent, since the consequent\nshares no content with the antecedent. Various constraints can be\nimposed on the idea of content-sharing, leading to various\nnon-classical logics of so-called relevant implication (see\nMares\u2019s 2020 SEP entry on relevant logics for an overview, and\nWeiss 2019 on the use of analytic entailment to deal with\nSextus\u2019 so-called fourth conditional).\n\nAnother approach to the notion of relevance is in terms of the idea\nthat the antecedent of a conditional should make a difference to the\ntruth, assertability or probability of the consequent. Consider a\nconditional like \u201cif London is in England, then Aristotle was a\nGreek philosopher\u201d. The conditional sounds odd because the truth\nof the antecedent does not matter to the truth of the consequent.\nWhile relevant logics capture the idea of relevance in terms of\ntopic-sharing, here the idea of relevance is captured in terms of the\ndifference that the antecedent makes for the consequent.\n\nThe idea of difference-making itself can be formulated in\nseveral ways. One way is proposed by Douven, in what he calls the\n\u201cEvidential support thesis\u201d (\u201cEST\u201d, Douven\n[2008, 2016: 108]). Basically, the EST says that a conditional\n\\(A>C\\) is relevantly assertable provided \\(\\Pr(C|A)\\) exceeds a\nsufficiently high threshold and \\(\\Pr(C|A)>\\Pr(C)\\). Douven\u2019s\nmain argument in support of the latter condition\u2014which is a\nrelevance criterion\u2014is that high probability is not enough for\nassertion. He gives the example of the following minimal pair:\n\n(8)\n\n\na.\nIf there is at least 1 Head in the first 10 tosses of this coin,\nthen there is at least 1 Head in the first 100,000 tosses.\nb.\nIf Chelsea wins the Champion\u2019s league, then there is at\nleast 1 Head in the first 100,000 tosses.\n \n\n\nBoth statements are such that the probability of the consequent given\nthe antecedent is high. However, in (8)-b the antecedent does not\nincrease the probability of the consequent, it is irrelevant in that\nsense, and the conditional may be called a \u201cnon-interference\nconditional\u201d. Douven (2016) defines validity in terms of\nacceptability-preservation according to the EST criterion, for all\nthresholds \\(t\\in [0.5, 1)\\). The resulting logic is weak, in\nparticular it violates Modus Ponens, RW, AND, CMon, Cut, OR and\nContraposition. Douven establishes the validity and invalidity of\nspecific principles (see Douven 2016: Theorem 5.2.1), but a sound and\ncomplete axiomatization of his logic is still an open problem.\n\nMore recently, an alternative approach was proposed by Crupi and\nIacona (forthcoming-b), yielding a stronger logic. Crupi and Iacona\nuse the Rips measure of confirmation and associate to a conditional\n\\(A>C\\) a score defined as \n\n\\[\\frac{P(C|A)-P(C)}{1-P(C)}\\]\n\n\nwhen \\(P(C|A)>P(C)\\), and defined to be equal to \\(0\\) otherwise.\nThis yields a modified score of \u201cuncertainty\u201d for a\nconditional, which they substitute for the standard notion of\nuncertainty in Adams\u2019s definition of \\(p\\)-validity. The logic\nthey identify violates RW and Cut, but it validates AND, CMon, OR,\nModus Ponens, restricted forms of Aristotle\u2019s and\nAbelard\u2019s theses (principles of connexive logic), and even\nContraposition. Crupi and Iacona (forthcoming-a) present a\npossible-worlds semantics for what appears to be the same logic, in\nwhich contraposition plays a central role.\n\nAhead of this recent wave of work, Rott (1986) pioneered another\nmeasure of relevance in a belief revision framework, a measure picked\nup by Spohn (2013), and proposed independently in various accounts of\ncausality. Arguing against Conjunctive Sufficiency (see\n sections 2.2),\n Rott\u2019 suggests that a \u201cdifference-making\u201d\nconditional \\(A>C\\) is accepted provided \\(C\\in K*A\\) and \\(C\\notin\nK*\\neg A\\). This is a relevantized variant of the Ramsey Test, ruling\nthat the conditional is accepted provided the revision by \\(A\\)\nresults in the belief that \\(C\\), but the revision by \\(\\neg A\\) does\nnot result in the belief that \\(C\\). Using the terminology of\n\u201cdifference-making conditionals\u201d, Rott (forthcoming) calls\nthe violation of RW the hallmark of conditionals that encode the idea\nthat the antecedent is positively relevant to the consequent. This\nyields a logic that also invalidates CMon, Cut, Or and Contraposition,\nbut it validates And, Aristotle\u2019s theses, a restricted form of\nAbelard\u2019s thesis as well as conditions such as\n\n(\\(>\\)1)\nIf \\(A >B\\wedge C\\), then \\(A>B\\) or \\(A>C\\).\n(\\(>\\)2a)\n\\(A>C \\tiff (A >A\\wedge C \\text{ and }A >A\\vee C)\\).\n\n\nIn general conditionals with a relevance reading tend to behave in\nrather unusual and unruly ways. Raidl (2021) develops a general\ntechnique of transferring completeness results for more\n\u201cwell-behaved\u201d suppositional conditionals \\(>\\) to\nrelevance-expressing conditionals definable in terms of \\(>\\). He\nis thus able to cover the proposal of Crupi and Iacona as well as that\nof Rott in a unified manner.\n\nRott\u2019s proposal turns out to be related to what is known as the\n\u201cdifference measure\u201d or as the \u201cscore of\ncontingency\u201d \n\n\\[\\Delta(p)=P(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)-P(C|\\neg A)\\]\n\n\nin the psychology of causality (Shanks 1995; Cheng 1997). In\nparticular, (Skovgaard-Olsen et al. 2016) found that depending on\nwhether this measure is positive, negative, or null, the probability\nof a conditional may or may not equal the conditional probability. In\nother words, relevance considerations appear to interact with\nassignments of probabilities to conditionals, the main finding being\nthat Adams\u2019 Thesis appears to hold good only when \\(\\Delta(p)\\)\nis positive. The equation breaks down, on the other hand, when\n\\(\\Delta(p)\\) is null, so precisely in the case of non-interference\nconditionals. Furthermore, Rooij and Schulz (2019) argue that an even\nbetter predictor of the acceptability of conditionals is given by a\nnormalized measure of contingency, that is, by the measure\n\n\\[\\Delta^*(p) = \\frac{P(C|A)-P(C|\\neg A)}{1-P(C|\\neg A)}.\\]\n\n\nWhether in logic or in the psychology of reasoning, the investigation\nof relevance measures and of the resulting inferences is currently a\nvery active field in the study of conditionals.\n8. Modals and Speech Acts\n\nThe previous sections have looked at propositional logics of\nconditionals, which extend Boolean logic with a distinguished\nconditional operator. To wrap up, we look briefly at some richer\nlanguages, in particular at the interplay of conditionals with\nmodalities, and at the interplay of conditionals with other speech\nacts than assertions.\n8.1 Modalities\n\nPossible-worlds analyses of conditionals make it possible to define\nmodalities from conditionals as follows (Stalnaker 1968; Nute\n1980): \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\Diamond A & \\equiv \\neg (A > \\neg A)\\\\ \\Box A &\\equiv (\\neg A > A)\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nConversely, we saw how strict conditional analyses treat the\nconditional as definable from modalities. Those facts may seem to\nsuggest that modals and conditionals are interdefinable. However, the\ninteraction between them is actually more complex.\n\nLinguistic facts about conditionals suggest that across a wide range\nof languages, modal operators commute with conditional\nantecedents.\n\n(9)\nIf \\(A\\) then necessarily \\(C \\equiv\\) Necessarily if \\(A\\) then\n\\(C\\).\n(10)\nIf \\(A\\) then possibly \\(C \\equiv\\) Possibly if \\(A\\) then\n\\(C\\).\n\n\nSuch facts centrally motivate Kratzer\u2019s account of conditionals\nas restrictors of modal operators (Kratzer (2012), inspired by D.\nLewis 1975). As Kratzer (1991, pp. 468\u2013469) puts it,\n\u201cthere is a very close relationship between if-clauses\nand operators like must\u201d, and more specifically\n\u201cfor each world, the if-clause has the function of\nrestricting the set of worlds which are accessible from that\nworld\u201d.\n\nKratzer formulates the restrictor view of conditionals by relativizing\nthe semantics of modals to two premise sets, a so-called modal base\n(\u201chard\u201d facts known or believed by the speaker) and an\nordering source (\u201csoft\u201d facts taken to be revisable).\nConsider a model \\(\\langle W, \\Gamma, \\Delta\\rangle\\) where \\(\\Gamma\\)\nis a premise function for the ordering source, and \\(\\Delta\\) the\npremise function for the modal base. Let us assume the Limit\nassumption and let \\(\\max_{\\Gamma(w)}(F)\\) be the set of worlds in a\nproposition \\(F\\) that satisfy a maximal set of propositions in\n\\(\\Gamma(w)\\). Kratzer\u2019s semantics for \\(\\Box\\) is:\n\n(Kratzer\u2019s Must) \n\n\\[ M, w,\\Gamma, \\Delta\\Vdash \\Box C \\tiff \\max_{\\Gamma(w)}\\left(\\bigcap \\Delta(w)\\right)\\subseteq \\lvert C\\rvert^{M,w,\\Gamma, \\Delta}\\]\n\n\nThe conditional \u201cif \\(A\\) then \\(C\\)\u201d can be treated as a\nbinary modality \\(\\Box(A,C)\\), with the following truth conditions,\nwhere \\((\\Delta+A)(w)\\) equals \\(\\Delta(w) \\cup \\{\\lvert\nA\\rvert^{M,w,\\Gamma, \\Delta}\\}\\):\n(Restricted Must) \\[M, w,\\Gamma, \\Delta\\Vdash \\Box (A,C) \\tiff M, w, \\Gamma, (\\Delta+A) \\Vdash \\Box C\\]\n\nFor bare conditionals, Kratzer postulates that the antecedent also\nrestricts a covert modal. This particular assumption is a source of\ncontroversy. Several authors point out that while if-clauses\nmay restrict operators, modal operators and conditional operators can\nalso have separate contributions (von Fintel 1994; M. Kaufmann &\nS. Kaufmann 2015).\n\nAn important issue is whether the interaction of modals and\nconditionals can be accounted for when both types of operators are\nlogically represented in the language. We highlight two recent\naccounts along those lines. Both take inspiration from Yalcin\u2019s\n(2007) conception of modal operators as expressive devices, and also\nfrom Veltman\u2019s (1996) and Gillies\u2019s (2004) emphasis on the\nidea that utterances involving epistemic modals update informational\nstates.\n\nCiardelli (forthcoming) states truth conditions for a language with\nmodal operators and a conditional operator. He defines the semantic\nvalue of sentences relative to two parameters, a state parameter \\(s\\)\n(set of worlds), and an attitude parameter \\(a\\). In Ciardelli\u2019s\napproach, if-clauses restrict the state \\(s\\), as in\nKratzer\u2019s approach, but modals basically act on the attitude\nparameter \\(a\\), which can express various modal forces (universal,\nexistential, or probabilistic). The framework allows him to derive as\nequivalences the facts\n (9)\n and\n (10),\n in the following guise: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} A > \\Box C & \\equiv \\Box(A > C)\\\\ A > \\Diamond C & \\equiv \\Diamond (A > C) \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBare conditionals of the form \\(A>B\\) turn out equivalent to\nconditionals \\(A>\\Box B\\), but only under the default attitude\ncoming with universal force. Ciardelli (forthcoming) also derives the\nincompatibility of the conditional \\(A>C\\) with the\nmight-conditional \\(A>{\\Diamond \\neg C}\\) (If-Might Contradiction,\nhenceforth IMC). The same incompatibility is at the heart of\nSantorio\u2019s (forthcoming) so-called path semantics for\nconditionals. Santorio exposes a contradiction between this principle\nand two other principles of conditional logic, namely CEM and the\nDuality principle whereby \\(A>\\Diamond C\\,\\equiv\\, \\neg (A >\\neg\nC)\\) (endorsed by D. Lewis 1973, though rejected by Stalnaker 1968).\nHis semantics validates IMC and preserves CEM, but drops Duality. A\nnumber of further predictions follow from Santorio\u2019s semantics,\nin particular OI becomes valid, as well as restricted versions of IE.\nLike Ciardelli, Santorio does not have to treat bare conditionals as\nimplicitly modalized, and like Ciardelli he can derive commutation\nfacts about modalities.\n\nBeside those proposals, Omori (2019) focuses also on the interplay of\nnegation, modals, and conditionals in the framework of connexive\nlogics. Omori uses Odintsov and Wansing\u2019s (2010) four-valued\nframework for modal logic, to show that conditional negations of\nvarying strength for \\(A>B\\) can be derived from the outer negation\nof a conditional (building on distinctions made in \u00c9gr\u00e9\n& Politzer 2013), in particular \\(A>{\\Diamond\\neg B}\\) instead\nof \\(A >\\neg B\\). He gives sound and complete axiomatizations for\nthe resulting conditional logics. An earlier connexive system is\nOlkhovikov (2002)\u2019s logic\u00a0LImp,\neffectively combining Cooper\u2019s conditional with a trivalent\nnecessity operator of determinate truth (mapping 1 to 1\nand\u00a0\u00bd and 0 to 0).\n8.2 Beyond assertion\n\nConditionals do not only appear in declarative sentences, but also in\nquestions and in commands, as in:\n\n(11)\nIf John visits, will Mary visit too?\n(12)\nIf John visits, make sure to bring cheese!\n\n\nThe semantics of imperatives and interrogatives lies beyond the scope\nof this entry. However, we mention such constructions because they too\nmay be seen as supporting Kratzer\u2019s restrictor analysis. In\nparticular, S. Kaufmann and Schwager (2011) treat imperatives as\ninvolving a covert modal operator, which can have a deontic, or\nbouletic meaning, but basically acting like \u201cmust\u201d. In the\ncase of questions, Isaacs and Rawlins (2008) treat questions as\nprefixed with a covert speech act operator, coming with a modal domain\nrestricted by the if-clause. In a related way, Ciardelli,\nGroenendijk, and Roelofsen (2018) point out that the semantics of a\nquestion can be specified by resolution conditions relative to an\ninformation state. Again, conditional questions can be viewed as\nappropriately restricting the information state to the antecedent\nworlds, so as to resolve the question relative to those (see\nCiardelli, forthcoming). For a polar question of form \\(?M\\)\n(\u201cwill Mary visit?\u201d) the information state \\(s\\) resolves\nit if either \\(s\\) supports \\(M\\) or \\(s\\) supports \\(\\neg M\\). In the\ncase of a conditional polar question like\n (11),\n the semantics of Ciardelli, Groenendijk, and Roelofsen (2018)\npredicts that a state \\(s\\) will resolve a question of the form \\(J\n>{?M}\\) provided either \\(s\\) supports \\(J >M\\) or \\(s\\)\nsupports \\(J >\\neg M\\).\n\nFurther connections have been explored between the semantics of\ninterrogatives and the very structure of conditional sentences. Starr\n(2014b) in particular argues that all conditionals have a\ntopic-comment structure, allowing to treat the antecedent as a covert\nquestion itself. Finally, more aspects of the interaction of\nconditional phrases with speech acts deserve to be mentioned,\nincluding so-called biscuit-conditionals (\u201cif you want\nsome biscuits, there are some in the cupboard\u201d, Austin 1956,\nLycan 2001), as well as concessives (\u201ceven if A, B\u201d\nsentences, see Lycan 2001, Guerzoni and Lim 2007). For both kinds,\npermitted inferences differ significantly from those found in regular\nconditionals (in particular, both entail the truth of the consequent).\nThis is evidence that the diversity found in logics of conditionals\nalso depends on the variety of uses and linguistic environments in\nwhich if-clauses occur.",
