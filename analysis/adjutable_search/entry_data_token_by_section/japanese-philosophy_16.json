    "main_text": "Possible Contributions to Philosophy at Large || The Agency of No-I vs. Autonomous Self\n5.4 Language and Meaning\n\nAt least since Aristotle (see his Metaphysics 1011), Western\nphilosophers have commonly assumed that the primary meaning (or truth)\nof words lies in their ability to refer to already existing realities.\nOften implicit in that assumption is that (1) reality is fixed, or at\nleast stable enough to be pinned down by linguistic expression; (2)\ncontext is not necessarily determinative in meaning; (3) the audience\nis irrelevant or at least externally, not internally, related to the\nmeaning of the expression; (4) the semantic and syntactic, but not\nphonetic, aspects of the language carry the meaning; and (5) language\ndefines and restricts the possible meanings of things or events. Every\none of those assumptions has been challenged by major Japanese\nphilosophers, both classical and modern. In fact, some important\nthinkers have in one way or another denied or at least qualified\nall of them.\n\nFrom the Buddhist standpoint of reality as a field of interdependent\nevents in continuous flux, if words stand in external relation to that\nreality, they are perpetually trying to hit a moving target. If\ninstead language arises from engagement with the field itself, then\nthe words, reality, and speaker will express the moment together as\npart of the flux. As the contexts change, so also will the forms of\nexpression. Thus, starting with the sound of words as his foundation,\nK\u016bkai spoke of the internal relations among sound-word-reality.\nBecause the cosmos of things and the utterance of words are both\nvibrations, truth-words (shingon) arise from the resonance\namong the three. We could say K\u016bkai\u2019s view is that the\ntruth of words arises from their ability to confer with, rather than\nrefer to, reality. (See the entry on \n K\u016bkai, section 3.7.)\n\nThe medieval Zen master D\u014dgen distinguished the raw phenomenal\npresence (genj\u014d) that precedes meaning from how it\nacquires meanings through its dependence within a contextual field.\nThus, the same presence may shift its meaning as the field shifts.\n\u201cIf we inquire into the manner and style of the totality of\nphenomena\u2026, we should bear in mind there are many worlds\neverywhere.\u201d (JPS 146) That is, language and phenomena are parts\nof single field that is in flux and can auto-generate multiple\ncontexts and meanings. My book may become a paperweight as soon as a\npuff of wind begins to blow away the papers on my desk, for\nexample.\n\nThe audience as well is part of the field shared by words, speakers,\nand things. Different expressions are used in addressing different\npeople. For most Japanese Buddhist philosophies, ordinary language is\nalways heuristic expression (h\u014dben; Sankrit:\nup\u0101ya) in that words are directed to someone to lead\nthem to some insight. So words are always being adjusted. Mori Arimasa\n(1911\u20131976) noted that Japanese syntax demands multiple levels\nof formality and politeness indicating the social space shared by\nspeaker and listener. That characteristic, he claims, gives the\nlanguage an inherently second-person, rather than impersonal,\nthird-person feel (JPS 1047\u201352).\n\nAnother way Japanese philosophers of language analyze how words can\naddress the fluidity of the field of impermanent, interdependent\nevents is to develop theories that focus on the predicate rather than\nsubject of the sentence as the nucleus of meaning. The sentential\nsubject is usually a noun that refers to a substance and the predicate\nits attribute. To capture a world of events rather than things, on the\nother hand, one can focus on the meaning as emerging from predicate,\nthe subject becoming in effect a modifier rather than a cause or agent\nof the event. Such predicate-based analyses of language were developed\nby Sakabe Megumi (1936\u20132009), Nishida Kitar\u014d\n(1870\u20131945), and the linguist Tokieda Motoki (1900\u20131967).\n(JPS 979\u201392)\n\nA final strategy for approaching the word-thing relation is to turn\nthe usual Western assumption upside down and claim that there are no\nthings (mono) at all until language fixates events\n(koto) by imposing names on them. That is, words do not refer\nto pre-existing things, but rather, words create things. The\npsychiatrist-philosopher Kimura Bin (1931\u2013 ) has analyzed the\nhuman compulsion to stabilize and reify the flow of events as an\neffort to reinforce our sense of a discrete ego (JPS\n958\u201372).\n\nUeda Shizuteru (1926\u2013 ), a member of the Kyoto School, has\ndeveloped a detailed theory of language along similar lines (JPS\n766\u201384). Like Zen Master D\u014dgen, Ueda argues language\ntranslates the empty, not-yet-meaningful \u201cpre-thing\u201d\n(Vor-sache) into a thing with meaning. Having evoked\nthat meaning, the word recedes back into the hollow void and the thing\ntakes its place in the totality we call \u201cworld.\u201d If we\nneed to subsequently point to those things, we can again call up the\nword that originally conjured up the thing since the word-thing link\nhas already been established and the word can simply refer back to\nthat link without creating anything new. That is not the whole story,\nhowever. There are other words (fictional, metaphorical, poetic\nexpressions) that do not point to such things in the world at all but\nare \u201chollow words.\u201d Such words are not about things as\nmuch as they are about words themselves or, better stated, about\nhow words work. Ueda claims, therefore, that through poetic\nand religious language, we do not learn about things, but about the\norigin of things, about how the \u201cworld\u201d came into being\nand how meaning is generated. \n\nThese themes and approaches suggest just a few of the riches in\nJapanese philosophy that might intrigue a philosopher from any\nculture. As Japanese philosophy becomes better known and increasingly\naccessible through translation and Western commentaries, it seems\nlikely it may engage an ever wider circle of philosophers worldwide,\nbecoming a resource for Western philosophy as Western philosophy has\nhistorically been a resource for it.\n",
