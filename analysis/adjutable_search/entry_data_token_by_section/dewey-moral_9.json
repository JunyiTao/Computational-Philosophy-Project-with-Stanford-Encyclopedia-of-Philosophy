    "main_text": "Metaethics of Value Judgments || Contextualism\n2.5 Contextualism\n\nDewey\u2019s moral epistemology is contextualist. The form of a\ncontextual standard of value is: it solves the problem encountered in\nthis situation (better than other imagined or tested solutions). A\nperson may articulate the problematic features of her situation in\nvarious ways: as obstacles, confusions, conflicts, unmet needs,\ndangers, and so on. The test of a value judgment \u2014 whether it\n\u201cworks\u201d \u2014 is whether it successfully identifies an\naction that overcomes the obstacles, clears up the confusions,\nresolves the conflicts, satisfies the needs, avoids or eliminates the\ndangers, and so on. The standard of success for value judgments is\nthus developed internally to the practices at hand, relative to\npeople\u2019s descriptions of their problems (HNC 199, 208; RP\n173\u20134). Of course, hypothesized solutions may fail in practice.\nThis may lead agents to revise their understandings of their problems,\nrather than just trying alternative solutions to the same problems.\nFor example, the failure of a course of therapy may lead a doctor to\nreconsider the original diagnosis. The problematic features of\nsituations are not given. Identification of the problem begins in\noften inchoate experiences of doubt, confusion, apprehension,\nfrustration, distress, anger, conflict, and so forth, which call for\narticulate diagnosis. Such diagnoses or descriptions of problems are\nopen to further refinement and even radical revision in light of\nexperimental testing in tandem with proposed solutions.\n\nIn upholding contextualism, Dewey rejected the idea that standards of\ncorrectness for valuing could be devised external to practice. He\nrejected any conception of intrinsic value as some kind of existence\nor property that has value in itself, regardless of context, which is\nthe object of practice to bring about, realize, or conform to.\nAsserting the existence of such values tears the practice of making\nvalue judgments out of the contexts that give them meaning and point.\nThis does not mean that one cannot make meaningful general value\njudgments. Some problems and solutions are of a generalized sort,\nencountered in many situations that vary widely in their details.\nAbstract, general value judgments may therefore be useful in a wide\nrange of situations. But this does not mean that they point to values\nthat exist outside of practice (TV 230).\n",
