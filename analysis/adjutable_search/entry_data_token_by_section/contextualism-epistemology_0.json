    "main_text": "Some Recent History, By Way of Background\n1. Some Recent History, By Way of Background[1]\nEC is a relatively recent development. Nevertheless, in the latter half of the 20th century, several at-times overlapping strands emerged which, in one way or another, made contextual factors of central importance to certain epistemological questions, thereby setting the stage for EC.\nOne such strand was the entertaining of the possibility of pluralism concerning epistemic standards. In one instance, this took the form of the claim, in response to skepticism, that there are two senses of \u2018know\u2019\u2014one strong or philosophical, the other weak or ordinary (see, e.g., Malcolm 1952). So too, some of Wittgenstein\u2019s (1953, 1969) claims about the relation between meaning and use and the multiplicity of \u201clanguage games\u201d opened the way for a more thoroughgoing semantic pluralism with regard to epistemic concepts and/or terms. Further, in a move foreshadowing contemporary contextualists\u2019 methodology, there was the argument for pluralism from cases: based in part on everyday examples, Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda suggested that \u201cwhat counts as knowing\u201d might depend on the situation (1980, 217), and Gail Stine claimed that \u201c[i]t is an essential characteristic of our concept of knowledge that tighter criteria are appropriate in different contexts\u201d (Stine 1976, 254).\nSecond, there was the emergence of Relevant Alternatives (RA) approaches to knowledge. Although, in the hands of Fred Dretske (1970, 1981a,b) and Alvin Goldman (1976), the RA approach was intended as an alternative to justification-centered accounts of knowledge, it also, like the strategy of multiplying senses of \u2018know\u2019, promised a way of giving skepticism its due while limiting the threat it posed to our ordinary knowledge claims. The core RA notion is simply that knowing that p requires ruling out only the relevant not-p alternatives. This provides a way of limiting skeptical threats, because skeptical possibilities might not ordinarily be relevant (cf. Austin 1946, 113, 88).\nVarious specific RA theories differ as to just what ruling out amounts to and what the standard of relevance is\u2014e.g., whether it has to do with \u201cthe kind of possibilities that actually exist in the objective situation\u201d (Dretske 1981b, 63; cf. 1981a, 131), or facts about the subject\u2019s psychological/conversational setting (Goldman 1976, 89; 1989, 147). But, insofar as there is some interesting variation in the set of relevant alternatives to a given proposition, we have the possibility of there being a corresponding variation in what it takes to know that p, and so a kind of pluralism here as well.\nThird, among some philosophers there was an increasing emphasis on regarding epistemic subjects, activities, and/or accomplishments, as deeply social in previously under-appreciated ways. (For some discussion, see Goldman and O\u2019Connor 2019.) Included here is Richard Rorty\u2019s (1979) \u201cepistemological behaviorism\u201d, as well as perhaps the first explicit statement of a \u201ccontextualist\u201d epistemic theory by David Annis. Annis\u2019 theory concerns justification, not knowledge, and it appeals to the subject\u2019s context rather than the attributor\u2019s. According to Annis, while \u201cman is a social animal\u2026when it comes to the justification of beliefs philosophers have tended to ignore this fact\u201d (1978, 215)\u2014more specifically, they have tended to ignore the existence of \u201ccontextual parameters essential to justification\u201d (ibid., 213): a person is justified in believing that p only if she can meet certain objections which express real doubts, where it makes a difference just who is expressing the latter (e.g., if the subject is being examined for an M.D. degree, it is important that the objector occupy the appropriate institutional role).\nFinally, the potential relevance of social factors to epistemological questions also arose in discussion of Gettier cases. In particular, in response to cases involving evidence one does not possess, John Pollock (1986, 190\u2013193)\u2014citing Harman (1968, 1980), who in turn credits Sosa (1964) with the idea\u2014suggested that there are certain things which we are \u201csocially expected\u201d to be aware of and that such expectations bear upon whether one knows. But if that\u2019s so, and if there is some kind of variability in such expectations, there will be a similar, socially-based variation in the standards for knowledge.\nOn each of the views or movements just mentioned, context is of central importance in epistemology, in ways not reflected in more traditional analytic writings on the subject. Still, there are important differences among them. Thus, there are some views \u2014such as Annis\u2019, which he intends as an alternative to foundationalism and coherentism\u2014which involve substantive claims about knowledge or justification. On the other hand, some proponents of ideas just mentioned are clearly concerned, not with knowledge or justification per se, but with the linguistic items we use in speaking about such things. For instance, among Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s goals is to elucidate \u201cthe contextual semantics of \u2018know\u2019\u201d (1980, 209).\nSo too, there are clear differences among the views just sketched as to just what context is: sometimes it is conceived in terms of the subject of the \u201cknowledge\u201d attribution, including features of his/her environment; sometimes, the concern is with facts about those who are attributing \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than the subject to whom \u201cknowledge\u201d is attributed (unless it is a self-attribution).[2]\nIn terms of the views mentioned above, just where to locate a given theory or theorist along both of these dimensions\u2014a substantive versus a semantic orientation; a subject versus attributor conception of context\u2014is not always clear. In current work in epistemology, \u2018contextualism\u2019 is used to refer to either of these now more clearly distinguished threads, with the discussion of each going on largely in separation from the other. Thus, on the substantive side, we have Michael Williams (1991, 2001), whose concern is with providing an alternative to \u201cepistemological realism\u201d. According to the latter view, exemplars of knowledge and/or justified belief have some underlying \u201cstructural unity\u201d that makes them all instances of a particular kind (1991, 108\u2013109), independently of any \u201csituational, disciplinary and other contextually variable factors\u201d (ibid., 119; 2001, 159ff.). By contrast, as defended by Williams, contextualism\u2014which he sees as present in Dewey, Popper, Austin, and Wittgenstein, for example\u2014is the view that it is only in relation to the latter type of factors that a proposition has any epistemic status at all (ibid.), and that there is no need to suppose that the objects of epistemological inquiry have some underlying unity. Meanwhile, on the semantic side, we have a number of figures, all of whom emphasize moreover the importance of facts about the attributor of \u201cknowledge\u201d\u2014such things as \u201cthe purposes, intentions, expectations, presuppositions, etc., of the speakers who utter these sentences\u201d (Cohen, 1999, 187\u2013188; cf. DeRose, 1992, 1995, 2009; Heller, 1999b, 117ff.)\u2014in affecting what is expressed by a given utterance of a \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentence.\nThe relation between these general sorts of contextualism\u2014the substantive and the semantic, as we might label them\u2014is interesting and important. But, as already indicated, the present entry will focus on the semantic view: EC, then, is attributor contextualism.[3]\n",
