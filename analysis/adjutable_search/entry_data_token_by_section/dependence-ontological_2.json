    "main_text": "The Modal-Existential Analysis of Dependence || The Modal-Existential Analysis\n2.1 The Modal-Existential Analysis\n\nLet us start from\n (1)\n in the previous section; how should this relationship between sets\nand their members be defined according to the modal-existential\nanalysis? An obvious proposal would be to say, quite simply:\n\n(EDR)\nx dependsR for its existence upon y\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nThe subscript \u201cR\u201d is used here because it seems\nappropriate to call this species of existential dependence of one\nobject upon another rigid existential dependence. Why\n\u201crigid\u201d? Because there is no flexibility here: the\nexistence of a given x requires the existence of that very\ny. It could not be something a little bit like y,\nsomething falling roughly in the same category, for instance; it\nmust be y. The definiens in (EDR) is\nequivalent to \u201cNecessarily, if x exists, then y\nexists\u201d, so that according to (EDR) the existential\ndependenceR of x upon y amounts to the\nstrict implication of y\u2019s existence by\nx\u2019s existence. We have mentioned one example of rigid\nexistential dependence, namely, sets ontologically depending on their\nmembers (more precisely, a set depends rigidly on the very members it\nhas, i.e., any change in a set\u2019s members will change the set\nitself). Another, although more controversial, example is a particular\nperson depending for her existence on her parents, or, more precisely,\non the particular sperm and egg that she originates from. This example\nis of course related to the essentiality of origin (as\ndiscussed in Kripke 1980).\n\nWe can express (EDR) in a more compact manner by resorting to further\nformalization (the following notation is used, e.g., in Correia 2008).\nWe can use the sentential operator \u201c\\(\\square\\)\u201d for\nmetaphysical necessity, the one-place predicate \u201cE\u201d\nfor existence, and the two-place sentential operator\n\u201c\u2192\u201d for material implication. Following this\nnotation, we can formalize rigid existential dependence as follows:\n\u201c\\(\\square(Ex \\rightarrow Ey)\\)\u201d, which can be read as\n\u201cx rigidly depends for its existence on y\u201d,\nor alternatively \u201cx rigidly necessitates y\u201d.\nNote that (EDR), somewhat controversially, implies that everything\ndependsR for its existence upon itself. It would,\nof course, be easy enough to modify (EDR)\u2019s definiens\nto read \u201cy is not identical with x and,\nnecessarily, x exists only if y exists\u201d, but that\nwould have the disadvantage of precluding anything from\ndependingR for its existence upon itself.\n\nWe can quite naturally contrast rigid existential dependence\nas defined by (EDR) with what might appropriately be called\nnon-rigid existential dependence, defined as follows:\n\n(EDN)\n x dependsN for its existence upon the F\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if the F\nexists.\n\n\nThe thought here is that\u2014to use the language of \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d\u2014\u201cthe F\u201d in any instance of\n(EDN) might well denote different entities in different\npossible worlds. So, for example, it might be said that a material\nobject x dependsN for its existence upon the\nmatter composing x, even though it might have been\ncomposed of different matter, because in every possible world in which\nx exists the matter composing x in that world\nexists in that world.\n\nOn the face of it, (EDR) seems to capture precisely one strongly\nintuitive notion of existential dependence; or more accurately, one\ndirection of that notion. The intuitive idea behind this notion is\nthat if y does not exist, then the dependent entity x\ndoes not exist. For example, when it is said that a particular event,\nsuch as the assassination of Caesar, depends for its existence upon\nCaesar, (EDR) seems to explicate this appropriately in terms of the\nfact that the assassination could not have existed if Caesar had not\nexisted to be assassinated. Some other assassination, we may\nsuppose, could have existed at that very time and place, but for\nthat very assassination to have existed, Caesar himself had\nto exist.\n\nHowever, there are clearly cases in which (EDR) fails to capture the\nintuitive sense of dependence at hand. Consider a living organism. A\nliving organism would appear to depend for its existence upon its\nparts, such as cells. But we also know that a living organism may\nsurvive a change of any of its cells, provided that the change is\neffected in a non-disruptive manner. It is true, of course, that such\nan organism must have parts such as cells if it is to exist,\nbut which objects those parts are is inessential\u2014and\nconsequently it is not the case that it depends for its existence, in\nthe sense defined by (EDR), upon any one of those parts. But it is\npossible to define another sense of existential dependence in\nwhich it is true to say that a composite object depends for\nits existence upon its proper parts; a generic notion of\nexistential dependence, defined as follows:\n\n(EDG)\n x dependsG for its existence upon Fs\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if some F\nexists.\n\n\nComposite objects are existentially dependent objects in the sense of\n(EDG), since they require the existence of proper parts (set F\nas \u201cproper part of x\u201d in (EDG)). Using the previous\nformal notation, we could express (EDG) as \u201c\\(\\square(Ex\n\\rightarrow \\exists Fy)\\)\u201d. Here we have added the existential\nquantifier \u201c\u2203\u201d as well as the general term\n\u201cF\u201d to express the thought that \u201cx\ngenerically depends for its existence on something being an\nF\u201d, or alternatively \u201cx generically\nnecessitates F\u201d. The important difference between the\nrigid and the generic cases is that (EDR) refers to a specific object\nwhereas (EDG) only requires that at least some Fs exist.\nAnother example, mentioned earlier, where (EDG) would seem to capture\nthe correct sense of dependence is\n (2),\n \u201cElectricity ontologically depends on electrons\u201d. More\nprecisely, we could say that electricity dependsG for its\nexistence upon electrons.\n\nWe would now have the tools to formalize most of the mentioned\nexamples, but note that there are cases where further tools are\nrequired. Consider:\n\n(4)\n\u201cChildren ontologically depend on their parents.\u201d\n\n\nOn the face of it, what we mean in (4) is that if parents x and\ny had not existed, then their child z could not have\ncome into existence. This looks like a case of rigid existential\ndependence, but it is clear that once z has been born,\nher parents can go out of existence without any effect on her own\nexistence. At that point, there is only past rigid\nexistential dependence. For cases such as this, we would require\ntemporally relativized versions of\n (EDN)\n and\n (EDG),\n but we will omit these complications here (see Thomasson 1998:\n24\u201334 and Correia 2005, 2008 for some versions of temporally\nrelativized ontological dependence).\n\nNote, incidentally, that generic existential dependence as\ndefined by (EDG) above is very close to a pluralized form of\nnon-rigid existential dependence, as defined by (EDN). We\ncould call this plural non-rigid existential dependence,\ndefinable as follows:\n\n(EDP)\n x dependsP for its existence upon the Fs\n=df Necessarily, x exists only if the Fs\nexist.\n\n\nThe similarity between\n (EDG)\n and\n (EDN)\n is apparent: saying\u2014for example\u2014that a composite object\nx dependsG for its existence upon proper parts of\nx is very close indeed to saying that x\ndependsP for its existence upon the existence of\nthe very kinds of proper parts that x\nhas.\n",
