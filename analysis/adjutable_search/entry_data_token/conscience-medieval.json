Since then scholars have done much to illuminate\nmedieval contributions to such perennial topics as the freedom of the\nwill, the problem of moral weakness, and what role, if any, the\nemotions and the moral virtues play in the achievement of happiness\n(e.g., Kent 1995, Saarinen 1994, Dumont 2000, Eardley 2006, Hoffmann\n2007, and Osborne 2014). Similarly, metaethical theories about the\nfoundations of morality that were prominent during the medieval period\nsuch as natural law theory\u2014particularly in its Thomistic and\nScotistic variants\u2014continue to receive robust scholarly\nattention (e.g., Porter 2005, M\u00f6hle 2003, Lisska 2012, Sweeney\n2012, and Cross 2012). Comparatively less consideration, however, has\nbeen devoted to what was believed to link the psychological to the\nmetaethical: the mental habit or act of conscience (and its\nsister-concept of synderesis), though interest in the subject has\nrecently seen a modest resurgence (e.g., Hoffmann 2012, Eardley 2013,\nand Dougherty 2018).\n\nWhat is the scope and nature of this apparent ability to intuitively\ngrasp right from wrong? Can conscience err and, if so, do its dictates\nstill bind? The best way to address these and other questions is to\nemploy a developmental approach. The term conscience is still\ngenerally used to refer to an innate moral sense, but it has slightly\ndifferent connotations today than it did in the medieval period, which\nin turn had different connotations from what preceded it in pagan\nantiquity and in Scripture. Still, medieval theories of conscience\ndrew extensively on these earlier sources. Since the concepts of\nconscience and synderesis evolved over time, then, it will be\nnecessary to take a linear approach to the topic and begin with some\nbackground.\n", "toc": [{"#BackPagaEarlChriCont": "1.

Background: The Pagan and Early-Christian Context\n1.1 The Ancient Context: Judicial Conscience\n\nTo understand the medieval theory of conscience, it is essential to\nexamine its etymology. Unlike most philosophical categories that are\ncentral to medieval thought, the concept of conscience did not have\nits origins in Plato or Aristotle (Potts 1982: 687). Rather, most\nscholars agree, it originated in the Greek playwrights of the fifth\ncentury BCE (Sorabji 2014: 12, 15\u201318). It is also possible to\nfind its use elsewhere in Greek literature, such as in the fragments\nof Democritus (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 5).\n\nThe English word \u201cconscience\u201d is derived from the Latin\nconscientia. Its Greek equivalent is syneidesis.\nBoth terms connote a state or act of \u201csharing knowledge with\noneself\u201d (Sorabji 2014: 12). This knowledge is privileged and\ninvolves awareness of a personal moral defect. The notion that\n\u201cI\u201d can judge \u201cmyself\u201d naturally suggests, as\nSorabji puts it, a sort of \u201csplit personality\u201d. That is,\nit suggests that I can at once be both the judge and the one being\njudged, particularly with respect to specific, past actions which\nordinarily elicit remorse. This suggestion is rooted in the quite\nintuitive idea that human beings are reflexive animals: beings who are\nnot only capable of turning their attention to objects in the outside\nworld but can also \u201cturn back on\u201d (reflectere) or\nbecome an object to themselves. As C. S. Lewis put it in his study of\nthe concept of concept of conscience in the Western tradition:\n\n\nMan might be defined as a reflexive animal. A person cannot help\nthinking and speaking of himself as, and even feeling himself to be\n(for certain purposes), two people, one of whom can act upon and\nobserve the other. Thus, he pities, loves, admires, hates, despises,\nrebukes, comforts, examines, masters or is mastered by,\n\u201chimself\u201d [\u2026] He is privy to his own acts, is his\nown conscius or accomplice. And of course, this shadowy inner\naccomplice has all the same properties as an external one; he too is a\nwitness against you, a potential blackmailer, one who inflicts shame\nand fear. (Lewis 1960: 187; see also Sorabji 2014: 12)\n\n\nLewis refers to this primarily pagan understanding of conscience as an\n\u201cinner witness\u201d. It does not judge our actions as right or\nwrong, but merely testifies to their existence:\n\n\nIt bears witness to the facts, say, that we committed a murder. It\ndoes not tell us that murder is wrong; we are supposed to know that in\nsome other way. (Lewis 1960: 190)\n\n\nOthers, however, regard the sort of conscience that Lewis describes\nhere as a type of internal judge, and therefore refer to it as\n\u201cjudicial conscience\u201d (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 8). While this\nproperty of the mind does not necessarily issue binding rules, it does\npass moral judgements on our deeds. It would, however, eventually take\non the role of issuing moral dictates for future acts as well. Eric\nD\u2019Arcy refers to this later form of syneidesis or\nconscientia as the \u201clegislative conscience\u201d whose\ninnovator, he argues, was the Apostle Paul (ca. 5 CE\u2013ca. 64/67\nCE), the most important founder of the Christian faith after Jesus of\nNazareth (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 8).\n1.2 St. Paul: Legislative Conscience\n\nThe judicial understanding of conscience continued well into the first\ncentury of the Common Era. To be sure, Paul himself continued to\nemploy it. At the same time, D\u2019Arcy credited Paul with\nintroducing, in addition to the \u201cjudicial conscience\u201d, a\nnovel conception he termed the \u201clegislative conscience\u201d.\nIt is not difficult to see why the earlier judicial conception would\nlater take on legislative features. This is because the ability to\njudge past actions as either right or wrong\u2014and to issue\nexhortations on that basis\u2014would, once this property came to be\nassociated with the moral law, take on the legislative role of issuing\ncommands. Indeed, it is in St. Paul that we find this very association\nbetween syneidesis and the moral law:\n\n\n[W]hen Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required\nby the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not\nhave the law. They show that the requirements of the law are written\non their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their\nthoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending\nthem. (Romans 2:14\u201315; NIV)\n\n\nJudging by this passage, there are evidently two expressions of the\nmoral law according to Paul: The Mosaic Law, explicitly handed down to\nthe Jews, and another law that is \u201cwritten on [men\u2019s]\nhearts\u201d. This latter was later glossed as a reference to the\nnatural law, which is accessible to all people, non-Jews included, and\nis consistent with the Mosaic Law. Notice that, according to the\nforegoing passage, conscience (syneidesis) is not the\nultimate source of right and wrong. Rather, the foundation of right\nand wrong is the objective moral law, which is both \u201cwritten on\n[men\u2019s] hearts\u201d and borne witness to by conscience.\n\nOne might say, then, that the objective norm of morality on\nPaul\u2019s account is the moral law (or natural law). Conscience,\nhowever, might be termed morality\u2019s subjective norm. This is\nmade clear in another passage from St. Paul, where he is addressing\nthe question of whether it is permissible for Christians to eat meat\nthat was previously sacrificed to idols. Some, Paul says, erroneously\nthink that to eat such food defiles them. In fact, since the pagan\nidols do not exist, eating food sacrificed to them, or indeed to God\nhimself, is morally irrelevant, since \u201cfood does not bring us\nnear to God\u2014we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if\nwe do\u201d (1 Corinthians 8:8; NIV). Still, even though the\nconsciences of such Christians are erroneous, they must follow them\nsince conscience, Paul suggests, is a rule of conduct (Romans\n14:13\u201323). Eric D\u2019Arcy sums up these two important\ncontributions of St. Paul as follows:\n\n\nSt. Paul, then, introduces an entirely new phase in the history of the\nterm \u201cconscience\u201d in moral theory, and two new features\ncharacterize his use of it. First, it is to play a directive\nrole before action takes place. In the pagan writers,\nconscience did not appear on the scene until after the action\nwas performed, and its role was purely judicial; but in St.\nPaul, conscience is credited with a legislative function, and it\ninduces an obligation in the proper sense. Second, conscience is\nfallible: the directions it issues may be mistaken; but whether it be\nmistaken or not, it seems that we are bound to follow its rulings.\n(D\u2019Arcy 1961: 11\u201312)\n\n\nIn sum, we might follow Sorabji\u2019s suggestion that this phase in\nthe development of the concept of conscience\u2014that is, from its\norigins in fifth-century BCE Greek literature to the first-century\nCE\u2014has eight features (Sorabji 2014: 36).\n\nIt involves a consciousness of the self rather than of\nothers.\nIt draws on values to which one feels personally committed or that\nare \u201cnot necessarily shared by others\u201d.\nIt is self-reflexive insofar as it suggests a \u201csplit\nperson\u201d: an \u201cI\u201d that has secret knowledge which it\nshares with itself.\nIts original purpose was \u201cretrospective\u201d or judicial,\nalthough it later incorporated into its definition a\n\u201cprospective\u201d or legislative function.\nAlthough it draws on general moral principles, it is chiefly\nconcerned with their application to the specific circumstances in\nwhich the agent finds him or herself.\nIt began as a secular concept.\nIn the Christian tradition it is regarded as susceptible to error,\nand\nalthough cognitive in character, it possesses motivating or\naffective power.\n\n1.3 St. Jerome: The Invention of Synderesis\n\nThat conscience was so central a concept in St. Paul\u2019s writings\nguaranteed it an important place in the moral theology of the Greek\nand Latin Fathers, especially St. Basil, John Damascene and St.\nAmbrose. Amongst these early writers, however, it was a text from St.\nJerome that was particularly consequential since it introduced into\nthe debate a neologism that would have an important impact in the\nlater Middle Ages: the concept of synderesis.\n\nIn the course of commenting on Ezekiel, Jerome had tied a\nprophecy mentioned in its first book to Plato\u2019s moral psychology\n(commentary on Ezekiel 1.7). The prophecy in question\nconsisted of a vision of four creatures emerging from the heavens,\neach with four faces: those of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle\n(Ezekiel 1: 4\u201314). In his gloss, Jerome noted that \u201cmost\npeople\u201d (plerique) interpreted this vision with\nreference to Plato\u2019s tripartite division of the soul in the\nRepublic: the human face representing reason, the\nlion\u2019s face the spirited part, and the ox\u2019s face the\nappetitive part (cf. Plato, Republic, 436b\u2013441b). What\ndid the eagle represent? According to Jerome, it represented that\n\u201cspark of conscience\u201d (scintilla conscientiae)\nwhich makes us aware of our sinfulness when reason, spirit or desire\nbecome disordered. Medieval manuscripts refer to this psychological\nproperty as synderesis (or sometimes\nsynteresis):\n\n\nNow above these three was the eagle; so in the soul, they say, above\nthe other three elements and beyond them is a fourth, which the Greeks\ncall synderesis. This is that spark of conscience which was\nnot quenched even in the heart of Cain, when he was driven out of\nparadise. This it is that which makes us, too, feel our sinfulness\nwhen we are overcome by evil Desire or unbridled Spirit, or deceived\nby sham Reason. It is natural to identify synderesis with the eagle,\nsince it is distinct from the other three elements and corrects them\nwhen they err [\u2026] However, we also see that this conscience\n(conscientia) is cast down in some people, who have neither\nshame nor insight regarding their offences, and loses its place\n[\u2026]. (commentary on Ezekiel 1.7; D\u2019Arcy trans.\n1961: 16\u201317)\n\n\nMost scholars now agree that the neologism \u201csynderesis\u201d\nintroduced in Jerome\u2019s commentary is simply a corruption of the\nGreek syneidesis (Kries 2002: 67). Since syneidesis\nis simply the Greek equivalent of the Latin term\nconscientia\u2014a fact of which Jerome would certainly have\nbeen aware\u2014one might have expected Jerome to use them\ninterchangeably. Surprisingly, however, Jerome suggests that the Latin\nterm means something different from the Greek term. In the text cited\nabove, he quite explicitly states that regardless of how morally\ncorrupt its possessor becomes, synderesis can never be lost. A few\nlines later, however, he does admit the existence of those who are\nshameless and lacking in moral insight. Such people are oblivious to\ntheir offenses because, according to Jerome, their conscience\n(conscientia) ceases to be present in them (\u201clooses its\nplace\u201d). If synderesis cannot be lost, but conscience can, then\nit seems to follow that they are separate properties of the soul. In\nany case, whatever Jerome\u2019s intention, this curious passage was\nindirectly handed down to the Middle Ages via the Sentences\nof Peter Lombard (1095\u20131160).\n2. The Early-Scholastic Tradition\n2.1 Peter Lombard: The Scholastic Origins of the Debate\n\nPeter Lombard\u2019s role in the evolution of the concept of\nconscience is both surprising and unsurprising. It is\u2014at first\nsight, anyway\u2014surprising because Lombard does not discuss\nconscience or synderesis in any actual detail. Indeed, he does not,\nstrictly speaking, mention the terms \u201csynderesis\u201d or\n\u201cconscience\u201d at all. What he does is merely to allude to\nJerome\u2019s commentary on Ezekiel in the context of\ndiscussing the will\u2019s role in how rational agents can naturally\nwant what is good while simultaneously being slaves to sin (Peter\nLombard, Sententiae in IV libros distinctae, 2.39; Potts\n1980: 92). In St. Paul\u2019s reference to moral weakness in Romans\n7:15, he famously says: \u201cFor I do not do what I want but do what\nI do not want\u201d. Is Paul suggesting, asks Lombard, that we have\ntwo separate wills: one naturally oriented towards the good and\nanother oriented towards sin? Or is it rather the case that we have a\nsingle will that, although naturally inclined to the good, contains a\ndefect which also \u201ctakes pleasure in what is evil\u201d\n(Sententiae in IV libros distinctae, 2.39; Potts 1980: 93)?\nAmongst those who hold the first view, the motivating power that\norients us towards the good is called the \u201cnatural\u201d will,\nwhile the inclination towards sin resulting from the Fall is called\n\u201cfree will\u201d (or \u201cfree choice\u201d). With respect\nto the former, Peter writes:\n\n\nFor some say that there are two motivations, one by which a man\nnaturally wants what is good. Why naturally? And why is it called\n\u201cnatural\u201d? Because such was the motivation of human nature\nin its original state, in which we were created without any defect,\nand this is properly called \u201cnature\u201d. For man was created\nwith a righteous will [\u2026] Man is therefore rightly said\nnaturally to want what is good, because he was constructed with a good\nand righteous will. For the higher spark of reason (superior enim\nscintilla rationis) which, as Jerome says, \u201ccould not even\nbe extinguished in Cain\u201d, always wants what is good and hates\nwhat is bad. (Peter Lombard, Sententiae in IV libros\ndistinctae, 2.39; Potts trans. 1980: 92\u201393)\n\n\nLombard\u2019s brief mention of Jerome\u2019s \u201cspark of\nreason\u201d (sic) in the aforementioned passage is the full extent\nof his treatment of conscience and synderesis. Still, that was\nsufficient to ensure that it would receive robust attention by later\nscholastics, who would track down the original text from Jerome in\norder to comment on it. A compilation of theological writings taken\nmainly from Scripture and the Fathers and arranged in systematic\nfashion, the Sentences had an enormous impact on later\ntheological enquiry since much it, after the 1220s, was carried out\nwithin the taxonomy that Lombard had laid out in his work. Indeed,\nafter Alexander of Hales (1185\u20131245) adopted the\nSentences as the main source for his ordinary lectures at\nParis in 1222, and Richard Fischacre (1206\u20131248) did the same at\nOxford in 1245, lecturing on the Sentences became a\nrequirement for every aspiring master of theology. Thus did such major\nscholastics of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as Bonaventure\n(1221\u20131274), Thomas Aquinas (1224/25\u20131274), John Duns\nScotus (1265\u20131308) and William of Ockham (1287\u20131347) come\nto write their important commentaries on the work. This tradition\nwould continue well into the sixteenth century.\n\nConsisting of four books, each subdivided into chapters, the\nSentences follows the distinction that Saint Augustine had\ndrawn in the De doctrina Christiana between the things that\nare real and the signs that lead us back to the former. Book one\ntreats of God, who is really real, and his triune nature. Book two\ndeals with creation and the fall, including human nature, treating\nthese as signs that point back to God. Book three treats of Christ,\nwho is the antidote to the fall, and who, as God incarnate, is both\nthing and sign. Finally, book four treats of the sacraments, which are\nsigns that assist the fallen in their return to God: the ultimate\nreality. Since book two deals with human moral psychology in the\ncontext of creation and the fall, it is here, in distinction 39, that\nPeter Lombard\u2019s mention of Jerome\u2019s commentary on\nEzekiel is found.\n\nSince Lombard\u2019s treatment of Jerome was partial and elliptical,\nlater thinkers, in composing their commentaries on the\nSentences, naturally turned to Jerome\u2019s text in order\nto scrutinize the original passage. There, they discovered his\napparent distinction between synderesis and conscience, which in turn\nwould come to frame the parameters of the later medieval debate. If\nsynderesis and conscience are in fact two separate parts of the soul,\nfor instance, what is their relationship to one another? What, come to\nthat, are their respective natures and, rather importantly, can they\nbecome disordered? Such questions would preoccupy the theologians of\nthe later Middle Ages.\n2.2 Stephen Langton: Synderesis and its Properties\n\nStephen Langton (1155\u20131228), regent master of theology at Paris\nand later Archbishop of Canterbury, is important in the present\ncontext less for any systematic treatment of conscience\u2014indeed\nStephen scarcely touches on the issue at all\u2014than for his\nsomewhat scattered views on synderesis. The relevant treatment comes\nin Stephen\u2019s Quaestiones disputatae of 1203\u20131205\nin the context of his discussion on free decision (liberum\narbitrium).\n\nFor Stephen, there are three powers (vires) of the soul that\nare relevant to the moral life: the concupiscible appetite, reason and\nsynderesis. The concupiscible appetite draws reason towards what is\nbad\u2014specifically towards the sin of sensuality\u2014while\nsynderesis attempts to sway it towards the good. It is reason\u2019s\njob to adjudicate between these two impulses. Freedom of decision\n(libertas arbitrii) is the outcome of reason directing the\nwill to choose in accordance with either the promptings of sensuality,\nor the promptings of synderesis (Stephen Langton, Quaestiones\ndisputatae; Lottin ed. Psychologie et morale I, 1942:\n61).\n\nThe purpose of synderesis, then, is to direct reason away from vice\nfor it is the faculty \u201cby which a person naturally detests what\nis evil and is a part of the rational power\u201d (Quaestiones\ndisputatae; Lottin ed. Psychology et morale II.1, 1948:\n112). Can such a power be extinguished? Yes and no. In its capacity as\nan inclination towards the good, which is accidental to it, synderesis\ncan indeed be lost in the damned. Essentially speaking, however, the\npurpose of synderesis is to repudiate what is wicked. In this sense,\nit is never lost, even in the damned (Quaestiones disputatae;\nLottin ed. 1948: 111).\n\nStephen Langton\u2019s most important contribution to the development\nof the concept of synderesis occurs in his discussion of whether\nsynderesis can merit or demerit. In the process of discussing this\nissue Stephen links synderesis to the practical syllogism,\nspecifically associating it with the grasp of general principles\n(Quaestiones disputatae; Lottin ed. 1948: 113). D\u2019Arcy\nsums up Langton\u2019s position as follows:\n\n\nRemorse of conscience is the work, not of synderesis, but of reason,\nfor synderesis remains at the level of general principles, whereas\nreason descends to the concrete case; but it is precisely over the\nconcrete case that remorse of conscience is felt; hence it is by\nreason, and not by synderesis, that we sin. (D\u2019Arcy 1961:\n23\u201324)\n\n\nLangton\u2019s association of synderesis with general moral\nprinciples would, as we will see, influence later thinkers such as\nAquinas.\n2.3 Philip the Chancellor: The First Systematic Treatment of Synderesis and Conscience\n\nAlthough Stephen Langton was the first scholastic to touch on the\nissue of synderesis in any depth, it was Philip the Chancellor (ca.\n1170\u20131237) who wrote the first treatise devoted to exploring the\nrelationship between synderesis and conscience (Lottin 1948:\n139\u2013157). As chancellor of Notre Dame, Philip had the right to\ngrant the license to teach in the theology faculty at Paris, and it\nwas under his tenure that the Dominicans and the Franciscans acquired\ntheir chairs in theology: two for the former, and one for the latter.\nAlthough primarily an administrator, Philip was also a trained\ntheologian. His most important work is the Summa de bono,\nwhich includes the treatise on conscience.\n\nIn his treatise Philip sets out to answer several questions related to\nthe ontological status of synderesis, to the question of whether\nanyone can sin if they follow synderesis, and to whether it can ever\nbe extinguished. As to the ontological status of synderesis, Philip\ncites Jerome\u2019s authoritative suggestion that synderesis is a\nfaculty or power of the soul. Recall that Jerome had posited a\nquadripartite soul: one that is composed of reason, spirit, desire and\nsynderesis. Since the first three parts of the soul are potentialities\nand synderesis is classified alongside these, it seems to follow that\nit too must be a faculty or power of the soul, distinct from the\nfaculty of reason. Philip cites St. Paul and John of Damascus as\ncorroborating authorities who apparently share the view that\nsynderesis is a faculty of the soul independent of the others (Philip\nthe Chancellor, Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts\ntrans. 1980: 95\u201396).\n\nAgainst the claim that synderesis is a power of the soul, Philip\npresents arguments for the view that it is, on the contrary, a moral\nhabit. On this view, synderesis is to the natural will what choice is\nto the deliberative will: a disposition that regulates the rationally\nappetitive powers. But while choice simply regulates the deliberative\nwill with respect to the contingent good, or means towards happiness,\nsynderesis\n\n\nis a disposition arising naturally in conjunction with that\npotentiality by which the natural will is directed to what is good\nwithout qualification. (Summa de bono: Treatise on\nConscience; Potts trans. 1980: 96)\n\n\nMoreover, just as the impulse to sin is distinct from the soul, so too\nis synderesis. But whereas the former inclines the agent towards evil,\nthe latter inclines him towards goodness.\n\nIs synderesis, then, a power of the soul or a habit? This distinction\ngoes back to Aristotle, for whom powers are innate and associated with\nspecific capacities, while habits are acquired and associated, by\ncontrast, with tendencies to behave in certain ways. Habits, moreover,\ninhere in powers. Although both of these properties dispose the agent\nto act in particular ways, powers, in contrast to habits, are linked\nto the ability to do so contingently. If I am in the habit of speaking\nRussian, for instance, then I will have the tendency to do so on a\nregular basis. It is my preferred mode of communication, and I will\ntake every opportunity to express myself in that language. That I may\nhave the mere capacity\u2014or power\u2014to speak Russian, on the\nother hand, having studied it in school, say, in no way ensures that I\nwill do so even in situations where I probably should. I might, for\nexample, hate and resent speaking Russian for various reasons, and\ntherefore freely refuse to do so under any circumstances (see, e.g.,\nAristotle, Metaphysics 9.2, and Potts 1980: 20\u201322).\n\nAlthough Philip seems to favour the belief that synderesis is a habit,\nthe claim that it is a power of the soul has the rather weighty\nauthority of St. Paul and St. Jerome. Philip therefore splits the\ndifference, as it were, and argues that it is a \u201chabit-like\npower\u201d or \u201cdispositional potentiality\u201d\n(habitualis potentiae)\u2014a faculty of the soul that\ndisposes its possessor towards choosing the unqualified\ngood\u2014though one that is innate rather than acquired through\nhabituation:\n\n\nSynderesis, although the morphology of its name makes it\nsound more like a disposition than a potentiality, is nevertheless the\nname of a dispositional potentiality: I do not say of an acquired\ndisposition, but of an innate one. And thus, qua disposition\nit can be applied to what is related to it as a disposition,\nqua potentiality to what is related to it as a potentiality.\nFrom this it follows that it has a certain opposition to free choice,\na certain opposition to the impulse [to sin] and sensuality, and a\ncertain opposition to proheresis, which is part of free\nchoice: qua potentiality, it is disparate from free choice\nand from sensuality, qua disposition it is disparate from\nproheresis and the impulse [to sin]\u2026So, if anyone asks\nwhether it is a potentiality or a disposition, the right answer lies\nin taking something in between: a dispositional potentiality.\n(Summa de bono: Treatise on Conscience; Potts trans. 1980:\n97)\n\n\nIt would seem, then, that synderesis is a potentiality, albeit an\nunusual one. Is it connected to the cognitive side of the soul or to\nthe appetitive? According to Philip, it is related to the appetitive,\nand specifically to the rational appetite, that is, to the will,\nrather than to the sense appetite. However, as we saw, Philip divides\nthe rational appetite into what he calls \u201cnatural will\u201d\nand \u201cdeliberative will\u201d. The natural will signifies the\ngeneral inclination that humans have to the good or happiness as such.\nSuch an object is beyond the scope of choice. Having said that,\nhappiness can be achieved in any number of ways and by the acquisition\nof any number of legitimate, though contingent goods. Indeed, it is\nfair to say that rational agents never choose happiness as\nsuch, given that it is a mere abstraction. Rather, what they\nchoose are particular goods which, taken together, comprise the good\nlife if pursued in an orderly way. Such contingent goods are the means\nto happiness and are the objects of the deliberative will, and\ntherefore choice. Synderesis, according to Philip, pertains to the\nnatural will. It is the remnant of original rectitude or justice\nwhich, although damaged during the fall, remains in the soul in\ndiminished form. As Philip puts it, synderesis is that which\n\u201cmurmurs back against sin and correctly contemplates and wants\nwhat is good without qualification\u201d (Summa de bono: Treatise\non Conscience; Potts trans. 1980: 100).\n\nOn the matter of conscience and how it is related to synderesis,\nPhilip distinguishes them. For one thing, conscience can be mistaken\nwhile synderesis cannot. Specifically, conscience is the result of a\nconcurrence of synderesis with free decision (liberum\narbitrium). Put otherwise, it is the specific application of a\ngeneral moral principle that is the outcome of deliberation. When\ncorrectly applied, conscience is correct. When incorrectly applied, it\nerrs. In either case, the judgement of conscience generates a moral\nobligation to act. Philip uses the following example of how\nsynderesis, which is always right, can nonetheless conjoin with an\nerring conscience (Potts 1980: 104):\n\nUnerring universal premise of synderesis: \u201cEveryone who\nfalsely claims to be the Son of God should be put to\ndeath\u201d.\nErring minor premise of reason: \u201cThis Christ fellow is\nfalsely claiming to be the Son of God\u201d.\nErring judgement of conscience: \u201cTherefore this Christ\nfellow should be put to death\u201d\n\n\nFrom the foregoing example, it is clear that synderesis delivers a\ngeneral, non-deliberative proposition, while conscience yields what\nPotts calls a particular, \u201cdeontic proposition\u201d:\n\n\nPhilip\u2019s argument is [\u2026] that we need to distinguish\nbetween general and particular propositions which\nare of the form: \u201cA ought to \u03c6\u201d where the\nproper name of any person may be substituted for\n\u201cA\u201d and any verb-phrase containing a verb of action\nfor \u201c\u03c6\u201d (I shall henceforth call these \u201cdeontic\npropositions\u201d). (Potts 1982: 690\u2013692)\n\n\nIn the example given above, then, the first, universal premise is\ncorrect (by definition), while the conclusion, as mediated by erring\nreason, generates an incorrect deontic proposition, which is to say,\nan obligation to act, albeit a mistaken one.\n3. The Later-Scholastic Tradition\n3.1 St. Bonaventure: Conscience as Cognitive/Synderesis as Affective\n\nOne of the most prominent representatives of the Franciscan\nintellectual tradition, Bonaventure (1217\u20131274) lectured on the\nSentences at Paris from 1250 until 1252, when he became\nregent master in the theology faculty, a position he held until 1257.\nHis commentary on the Sentences is the fruit of these\nlectures, and it is in this work that he discusses the topics of\nconscience and synderesis. For Bonaventure we not only possess innate\nmoral knowledge, but we also have an inextinguishable inclination\ntowards achieving the good. Our inborn knowledge of the former, that\nis, of the natural law, is associated with conscience, which resides\nin the intellect, while our inclination towards desiring the good is\nassociated with synderesis, which inheres in the will.\n\nWhat is the ontological status of conscience? According to\nBonaventure, just as theologians have disagreed over the nature of\n\u201cthought\u201d, defining it variously as the power of thinking,\na habit or an apprehended principle of knowledge, so too have they\ndiffered over how to define \u201cconscience\u201d\n(conscientia). Most commonly, however, the term has been used\nto refer to a cognitive habit or disposition that relates to the\npractical as opposed to the theoretical intellect. Indeed, it is the\ndisposition that perfects the practical intellect. How so? Through its\nconsciousness of the principles that comprise the natural\nlaw\u2014such as that \u201cGod is to be honoured\u201d\u2014and\nthrough the issuing of such injunctions to the will. As Bonaventure\nputs it:\n\n\ntheoretical knowledge perfects our thought to the extent that the\nlatter is theoretical, whereas conscience is a disposition perfecting\nour thought to the extent that it is practical, or to the extent that\nit directs us towards deeds. (Bonaventure, commentary on the\nSentences, 2.39: a. 1, q. 1; Potts trans. 1980: 111)\n\n\nIs such a disposition innate or acquired? It is possible, according to\nBonaventure, to find authorities on both sides of the debate. For the\nopinion that conscience is innate, Bonaventure cites, among other\nauthorities, St. Paul\u2019s famous reference to a moral law that is\n\u201cwritten on [men\u2019s] hearts\u201d in Romans 1:14\u201315.\nHe also appeals to a \u201cnatural instinct to seek blessedness and\n[to] honor [one\u2019s] parents\u201d (commentary on the\nSentences, 2.39: a. 1, q. 2; McGrade trans. 2001:\n175\u2013176). For the opinion that conscience is not innate, on the\nother hand, Bonaventure cites Aristotle\u2019s claim that the soul is\na blank slate. Bonaventure\u2019s solution is to find a middle\nposition between St. Paul, on the one hand, and Aristotle, on the\nother. His conclusion: conscience is part innate, part acquired.\n\nIn what sense is it innate? Just as rational creatures have a natural\ncapacity to judge the veracity of first principles in the realm of\nspeculative reason, so we have an innate capacity to judge the first\nprinciples of practical reason. This innate capacity to immediately\ngrasp such principles as true or not in the realm of practical reason\nis called conscience. It is associated, for Bonaventure, with the\nAugustinian \u201cnatural light\u201d\u2014or \u201cnatural\ntribunal\u201d\u2014that is built into the structure of the mind and\nwhich permits rational agents to intuitively grasp the basic\nprinciples of the natural law (see, e.g., Augustine, City of\nGod, 11.27, Bettenson trans. 1972: 461\u2013462). Just as the\nmind is disposed to grasp, in the realm of theoretical reason, the\naxiomatic nature of such propositions as that \u201call bachelors are\nunmarried males\u201d, so too it has a innate disposition to grasp as\nself-evidently true such basic principles in the domain of practical\nreason as \u201cHonour thy father and mother\u201d and \u201cDo not\nharm thy neighbour\u201d.\n\nIn what sense, though, is conscience acquired? Although the ability to\njudge the deontic propositions of the natural law as self-evidently\ntrue is innate, it does not follow that the contents of such\npropositions are innate. It does not follow, that is, that the\nconcepts \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d in the precept\nto honor one\u2019s parents are in the mind from birth. And indeed,\nso Bonaventure thinks, they are not. Rather, they are species or\nlikenesses acquired through sense experience which, once acquired,\nform the terms of the universal propositions of the natural law that\nare intuitively grasped. In this sense, Bonaventure is true to\nAristotle:\n\n\nFor everyone agrees that there is an imparted light of the\napprehensory potentiality which is called a natural tribunal, but we\nacquire forms and likenesses of things by means of the senses, as\nAristotle says explicitly in many places, and as experience also\nteaches us. (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 2;\nPotts trans. 1980: 113)\n\n\nConscience, then, is partly innate and partly acquired with respect to\nthe content of the natural law. But what is the relationship of such\nuniversal premises to the conclusions of practical reason? How does\nthe agent proceed from a general knowledge of right and wrong to the\napplication of this knowledge to concrete situations? After all, such\nuniversal premises are only useful to the extent that they can be\napplied. For Bonaventure, the habit of directing the agent toward\napplying the general principles of the natural law to specific\nactions, like the habit of immediately grasping deontic principles, is\ninnate. But in order to apply this self-evident knowledge we must\nacquire further knowledge. For example, although we grasp a\npriori the truth that one should honor one\u2019s father and\nmother, we have no innate knowledge that John and Mary are our parents\nand that it is they specifically who must be honoured as opposed to,\nsay, Michael and Jane. Rather, this type of knowledge is derived from\nexperience and instruction.\n\nNote that conscience does not simply move from the general to the\nparticular with respect to concrete actions. It also moves from the\ngeneral to the specific with respect to propositions themselves. As\nPotts points out, there are in fact two classes of deontic\npropositions: basic and derived (Potts 1982: 698). Consider the\ndeontic proposition to obey God, which is basic, or maximally evident.\nObviously, other more specific precepts can be derived from this very\ngeneral one. Historically, for instance, from the basic deontic\nproposition to obey God the Jews derived the further, less evident but\nmore specific deontic propositions to refrain from eating pork and to\ncircumcise their sons. How did they come to know these more specific\npropositions? By means of a revealed commandment\u2014via (divine)\ninstruction, in other words (commentary on the Sentences\n2.39: a. 2, q. 3, ad 4; Potts trans. 1980: 120). Although the\ndistinction between basic and derived deontic propositions is\nPotts\u2019, and although the case cited is an example of an\nerroneous conscience (Bonaventure argues that male circumcision and\nthe prohibition on eating pork are no longer applicable), it\naccurately sums up Bonaventure\u2019s distinction between\npropositions that are \u201cvery clearly evident\u201d versus those\nthat are \u201cless evident\u201d:\n\n\nJust as some things that are cognizable are very clearly evident, such\nas axioms and first principles, while some are less evident, such as\nparticular conclusions, so also in things that can be done, some are\nevident in the highest degree, for example, \u201cDo not do to\nanother what you do not want done to you\u201d and that one should\nsubmit to God and suchlike. In the same way, then, as the cognition of\nfirst principles is said to be innate in us by reason of that light,\nbecause (due to their self-evidence) that light suffices for cognizing\nthem (after the reception of species) without any additional\npersuasion, so also the cognition of moral first principles is innate\nin us, in that that judicatory suffices for cognizing them. Again, in\nthe same way as cognition of the particular conclusions of the\nsciences is acquired, because the light innate in us does not fully\nsuffice for knowing them, but some persuasion and fuller acquaintance\nare needed, so on the side of things that can be done we must\nunderstand, similarly, that we are bound to do some things which we\nknow only through additional instruction. (commentary on the\nSentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 2; McGrade trans 2001: 179)\n\n\nThis distinction between basic, or very general principles, and\nspecific or derived precepts is germane to the question of whether\nconscience can ever be mistaken and, if so, whether in such cases it\ncontinues to bind. Bonaventure\u2019s response is that we can never\nbe mistaken about basic deontic propositions. Rather, it is with\nrespect to derived ones that we sometimes err since\n\n\nalthough conscience is always right so long as it sticks to the\ngeneral and is moved by simple inspection, it can become mistaken when\nit descends to particulars and brings things together, because the\nactualisation of deliberative reason is mixed with it. (commentary on\nthe Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 3, ad 4; Potts trans. 1980:\n120)\n\n\nIs one obliged to always follow one\u2019s conscience? It depends,\nsince conscience is fallible. If what it dictates is in accordance\nwith God\u2019s will, then one is obliged to follow it on pain of\neternal damnation. If erroneous\u2014if what it dictates is contrary\nto the divine will\u2014as is sometimes the case when applying basic\ndeontological principles, then conscience does not bind. Rather, the\nagent has an obligation to correct the error in order to bring his\nconscience into line with the natural law. If he does not, and follows\nhis erroneous conscience, he commits a mortal sin. \u201cIt is clear\nthat conscientia always either binds us to do what it tells\nus, or binds us to change it\u201d (commentary on the\nSentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 3; Potts trans. 1980:\n114\u2013115). Obviously, then, the intellect plays an important role\nin achieving happiness given its possession of conscience. But what of\nthe will? Does it not have an equally important role to play in the\nmoral life? Yes: in its possession of synderesis. In line with\ntradition, Bonaventure calls synderesis the \u201cspark of\nconscience\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2;\nMcGrade trans. 2001: 186). He breaks with tradition, however, in\narguing that it inheres in the will rather than in the intellect.\nIndeed synderesis, for Bonaventure, is precisely the counterpart of\nconscience insofar as the will, like the intellect, has an innate\ninclination towards the moral (as opposed to the useful) good. In the\ncase of the intellect this disposition takes the form of the\n\u201cnatural light\u201d of conscience that apprehends the first\nprinciples of the natural law; in the case of the will, it takes the\nform of synderesis: a \u201cnatural bias\u201d towards desiring the\nmoral good. There is one sense, however, in which synderesis is not\nexactly analogous to conscience. While it looks very much like a\nhabit, synderesis is rather, according to Bonaventure (presumably\nfollowing Philip the Chancellor), a habit-like power of the soul\n(commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 1; Potts trans.\n1980: 116\u2013117).\n\nCan synderesis ever be extinguished? No: it is an innate orientation\ntowards goodness that cannot be completely eradicated, ontologically\nspeaking, even in the most vicious of people. In its exercise,\nhowever, it can become impeded \u201ceither by the darkness of\nblindness, or by the wantonness of pleasure, or by the hardness of\nobstinacy\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q.\n2; Potts trans. 1980: 117). In such cases, synderesis ceases to\n\u201cmurmur\u201d against evil or \u201cgoad\u201d towards the\ngood, either because the agent is blinded by ignorance, distracted by\nphysical pleasure or is so stubbornly persistent in their depravity\nthat they cannot reorient themselves towards the good. Still, when\nsynderesis follows the innate judgement of conscience with respect to\nbasic deontic principles, which can never err, then it too functions\ncorrectly because that is its natural state. It has the potential to\ngo wrong and fall into sin only during the exercise of deliberation\nwith respect to particular truths since it is here that reason can\nbecome faulty and the will, which is free, disordered. When reason and\nwill malfunction synderesis is \u201coverthrown, in that its effect\nand its government over the other deliberative powers is repulsed and\nbroken\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 3;\nPotts trans. 1980: 119). When this happens, the agent sins.\n3.2 St Thomas Aquinas: Synderesis and Conscience as Cognitive\n\nThomas Aquinas (1224/25\u20131274) is, by any measure, one of the\nmost important, if not the most important, scholastic theologian of\nthe later Middle Ages. Although his views on conscience and synderesis\nhave received less attention in recent years than his theory of\nnatural law, this is unjustified. For the scholastics, a full account\nof morality includes not only an explanation of how practical norms\nare grounded, but also an understanding of how they are grasped and\nhow it is that rational agents, despite possessing an infallible guide\nto such knowledge, often fail to apply it. One\u2019s metaethics, in\nother words, is inextricably linked to one\u2019s moral psychology,\nwhich is to say, to one\u2019s understanding of how the will and the\nintellect interact with one\u2019s knowledge of right and wrong.\n\nAquinas discussed the issues of synderesis and conscience in several\nof his major works, from his early commentary on the\nSentences and the De veritate to his mature\nSumma theologica (see D\u2019Arcy 1961: 36\u201347). As\nmight be expected, his account is very different from that of his\nFranciscan contemporary Bonaventure. For one thing, Bonaventure\nassigns synderesis to the will. He also describes it, as we saw above,\nas a \u201chabit-like faculty\u201d. Aquinas, as might be expected,\nhews much closer to his Dominican mentor and teacher Albert the Great\n(ca. 1200\u20131280) for whom both synderesis and conscience belong\nto the intellect (see Dougherty 2018: 221).\n\nFor Aquinas, the rational part of the soul comprises the faculties or\npowers of intellect and will. The object of the will is the good, and\nthe object of the intellect is the true. The latter potency is further\ndivided into the speculative intellect (intellectus\nspeculativus) and the practical intellect (intellectus\npracticus). How do these differ? The object of the speculative\nintellect is truth as such, while the object of the practical\nintellect is the good \u201cunder the aspect of truth\u201d (Thomas\nAquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 11, ad. 2). Synderesis\nand conscience, for Aquinas, both belong to the practical\nintellect.\n\nAll reasoning must start from immediately evident principles if an\ninfinite regress is to be avoided. This is as true in the realm of\npractical reason as it is in the realm of speculative reason. Once\nsuch principles have been grasped and assented to, more specific\nconclusions can be deduced. How are these principles grasped? In the\ndomain of speculative reason, they are apprehended by the innate\ndisposition that Aquinas calls\nintellectus\u2014\u201cintuitive reason\u201d or\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d\u2014and that Aristotle called\nnous. The objects of this habit are such self-evident\npropositions as that \u201cevery whole is greater than its\npart\u201d and that \u201cthings equal to one and the same are equal\nto one another\u201d (Summa theologica I-II, q 94, a. 2,\ncorp.). Once their terms are known, the intellect immediately grasps\nthe truth of such propositions since they are analytic in nature. The\ncorresponding habit in the domain of practical reason, on the other\nhand, is synderesis: a property of the soul which can never be lost,\nwhich never errs, and whose objects are the first principles of the\nnatural law (De veritate 16.1, corp.). A good description of\nhow Aquinas understands synderesis is Hoffmann\u2019s, who calls it\nan \u201cinfallible moral awareness\u201d (Hoffmann 2012: 255). Like\nunderstanding, synderesis is innate:\n\n\nWherefore the first practical principles, bestowed on us by nature, do\nnot belong to a special power, but to a special natural habit, which\nwe call \u201csynderesis\u201d. Whence \u201csynderesis\u201d is\nsaid to incite to good, and to murmur at evil, inasmuch as through\nfirst principles we proceed to discover, and judge of what we have\ndiscovered. It is therefore clear that \u201csynderesis\u201d is not\na power, but a natural habit. (Summa theologica I, q. 79, a.\n12, corp.)\n\n\nIn broad terms, synderesis is a link between the human intellect and\nthe divine wisdom. The universe is created and governed by a\nprovidential God and is therefore subject to the order of final\ncausality. Accordingly, all things, rational and non-rational alike,\nseek their proper ends. Non-rational beings, since they lack will and\nintellect and are therefore incapable of prudential reasoning, achieve\ntheir ends through the natural inclinations that are implanted in them\nby God. In this sense, they participate in the providential plan for\nall creation that Aquinas calls the \u201ceternal law\u201d: the\ndivine wisdom insofar as it directs all creatures towards their ends\n(Summa theologica I-II, q. 93, a. 1, corp.). They do so,\nhowever, in a diminished way. Rational beings, by contrast,\nparticipate in divine providence in a more excellent way. This\nparticipation in the eternal law is called the natural law, whose\nmoral principles function to direct human beings toward their ultimate\nend: happiness (Summa theologica, I-II, q. 91, a. 2, corp.).\nThese moral principles, which are grasped and accordingly possessed by\nsynderesis, offer an insight into God\u2019s intentions for human\nbeings and therefore into the ultimate purpose of human life. As\nBaylor writes of Aquinas\u2019s theory:\n\n\nMoral principles are based upon and derived from a rationality that is\npresent in reality; they are a human knowledge of the exemplary ideas\nin the divine mind according to which creation is imbued with a\nrational order. (Baylor 1977: 46)\n\n\nPractical reasoning, then, plays a central role in the achievement of\nhappiness, the final end for humans, and therefore in God\u2019s plan\nfor us. Like speculative reasoning, practical reasoning generally\ntakes a deductive form. Just as science is the conclusion of the\ndemonstrative syllogism, so conscience is the conclusion of a\npractical syllogism. The practical syllogism, like the demonstrative\nsyllogism, contains a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion.\nThe major premise is drawn or deduced from synderesis. The minor\npremise, on the other hand, is drawn either from faith, natural reason\nor human positive law. From the major and minor premises, a conclusion\nis drawn that generates a moral obligation to act (Hoffmann 2012:\n258). This inferential judgment is associated, for Aquinas, with\nconscience: an act\u2014as opposed to a faculty or a habit\u2014that\nincludes a number of applications, such as \u201cto witness, to bind,\nor incite, and also to accuse, torment, or rebuke\u201d (Thomas\nAquinas, Summa theologica I, q. 79, a. 13, corp.).\n\nConscience acts as a \u201cwitness\u201d when it is consciously\naware of some personal wrongdoing, whether of commission or omission.\nIt \u201cbinds\u201d or \u201cincites\u201d when it makes a\njudgement that some act should be performed. Finally, it\n\u201caccuses\u201d, \u201ctorments\u201d or \u201crebukes\u201d\nwhen it judges that some past action was either morally acceptable or\nit was not. Although it is difficult to see how conscience in the\nfirst sense\u2014conscience as witness\u2014can function as an\napplication of knowledge to conduct, this seems less problematic in\nthe second and third senses of the term, which harken back to the\nlegislative and judicial senses of conscience found in St. Paul and\npagan antiquity, respectively (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 46). In any case, an\nexample of the way in which conscience applies the natural\nlaw\u2014whose principles are apprehended by synderesis\u2014 is\narticulated in Aquinas\u2019s De veritate:\n\n\nIf the judgement of synderesis expresses the statement: \u201cnothing\nprohibited by the law of God is to be done\u201d, and if the\nknowledge of higher reason presents this minor premise \u201csexual\nintercourse with this woman is forbidden by the law of God\u201d, the\napplication of conscience will be made by concluding: \u201cthis\nsexual intercourse is to be avoided\u201d. (De veritate, q.\n17, a. 2, corp.; cited in Dougherty 2018: 222)\n\n\nNow the dictates of conscience can either be right, if correctly\ndeduced from the natural law, or wrong, if they are incorrectly\ndeduced. The dictates of the former are the product of a\n\u201ccorrect conscience\u201d and the judgements of the latter are\nthe result of an \u201cerroneous conscience\u201d. Since synderesis\nis infallible, the main source of an erroneous conscience, when it\ndoes occur, is the agent\u2019s adoption of a faulty minor premise in\nthe practical syllogism (De veritate q. 17, a. 2; Potts\ntrans. 1980: 132\u2013133).\n\nNow it is clear that we have an obligation to follow a correct\nconscience since to do so contributes to achieving our final end. But\nwhat of an erroneous conscience? Does this have any authority? For\nAquinas, an erring conscience also binds. It does not, however,\nnecessarily excuse. As Hoffmann puts it,\n\n\nregardless of whether my action is objectively good, evil or\nindifferent, conscience binds, for it is by means of conscience that\nan action is proposed to me as good, bad, or indifferent. (Hoffmann\n2012: 260)\n\n\nFor example, it is objectively right\u2014in accordance with the\nnatural law\u2014to refrain from sex outside of marriage. But suppose\nthat an agent (mistakenly) believes that such abstinence is sinful,\nand yet still refrains. According to Aquinas, this agent, although he\ndoes what is objectively right, nonetheless sins. Why? Because in\nchoosing the opposite of what his conscience dictated, he chose to do\nsomething he believed to be evil. And choosing what is (subjectively\nif not objectively) wrong, for Aquinas, is a sin: \u201c[F] from the\nvery fact that a thing is proposed by the reason as being evil, the\nwill by tending thereto becomes evil\u201d (Summa\ntheologica, I-II, q. 19, a. 5, corp.).\n\nWhat follows from this is that conscience, whether right or erroneous,\nalways binds. As to the question of whether an erroneous conscience\nexcuses, on the other hand, that depends on the type of ignorance that\ncauses it. This is because some types of ignorance render an act\ninvoluntary and therefore excusable, and some do not. Ignorance that\nexcuses is called invincible, and concerns ignorance about the facts\nof the situation (assuming, of course, there is no negligence\ninvolved). Such cases, that is, where an agent could not have known\nbetter under the circumstances and would not have thus acted had he\nknown better, are excusable. Aquinas uses the example of\nfornication\u2014voluntary, illicit sex\u2014to illustrate his\npoint. Although it is a sin to commit adultery, a man is excused if he\nhas sexual relations with a woman who is not his wife, so long as he\nis genuinely, if improbably, mistakes the women for his wife. This\nis\n\n\nbecause this error arises from ignorance of a circumstance, which\nignorance excuses, and causes the act to be involuntary. (Summa\ntheologica I-II, q. 19, a. 6, corp.)\n\n\nIgnorance that contributes to an erroneous conscience that is in any\nway voluntary is vincible, or able to be corrected, and therefore\nculpable if followed. This generally happens where the agent\u2019s\nignorance of the particulars of the situation is either the result of\nnegligence, or where there is ignorance of the relevant moral\nprinciples. The former cases are the result of the agent not taking\nappropriate care to find out about the facts of situation so that he\nor she can sin while feigning ignorance. In the case of one\u2019s\nignorance of universal premises, this too is culpable since it is\none\u2019s obligation to know the moral law. (Summa\ntheologica I-II, q. 19, a. 6, corp.).\n\nBut one might be wondering how it is that culpable ignorance is even\npossible where it relates to general moral principles. How can one go\nwrong about the universal premises that form the major premise of the\npractical syllogism, which are drawn from the precepts which comprise\nthe natural law, if synderesis, which grasps such premises, is\ninfallible? Aquinas\u2019s answer is that there are two types of\nnatural law precepts: primary\u2014or those which are \u201cmost\ngeneral\u201d\u2014and secondary. Aquinas is less specific on this\ntopic than is optimal, but in drawing this distinction he seems to\nmean something like the following. About the primary precepts of the\nnatural law, no-one can go wrong. Unfortunately, as we have seen, such\nprecepts are of a very general character, such as \u201cdo good and\navoid evil\u201d. For such general knowledge to be applicable by\nconscience, it must be further specified. This further specification\ncomprises the secondary precepts of the natural law, which are closely\ndrawn from the former precepts and from natural inclination. About\nsuch secondary, derived precepts of the natural law, such as\n\u201cadultery is to be avoided\u201d, humans are all too prone to\nbecome ignorant. For Aquinas such ignorance is the result either of\nvice or of having been socialized in a culture with \u201cvicious\ncustoms\u201d:\n\n\nI answer that [\u2026] there belongs to the natural law, first,\ncertain most general precepts, that are known to all; and secondly,\ncertain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were,\nconclusions following closely from first principles. As to those\ngeneral principles, the natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be\nblotted out from men\u2019s hearts. [\u2026] But as to [\u2026] the\nsecondary precepts, the natural law can be blotted out from the human\nheart, either by evil persuasions, just as in speculative matters\nerrors occur in respect of necessary conclusions; or by vicious\ncustoms and corrupt habits [\u2026]. (Summa theologica\nI-II, q. 94, a. 6, corp.)\n\n\nA final problem seems to emerge: are we not, according to\nAquinas\u2019s account of the erroneous conscience, left with the\npossibility of a moral dilemma? For if we have an obligation to always\nfollow our consciences, but we sometimes sin when we do follow them,\nthen it seems that we are sometimes put into a double bind. We seem,\nthat is, to sometimes have conflicting obligations so that regardless\nof what we do, we sin. Aquinas\u2019s solution is that it is only\nwrong to follow a conscience that is in a state of vincible ignorance.\nSince such ignorance is by definition correctable, we can always\nresolve the apparent dilemma by choosing to put aside our ignorance.\nAs far as acting from invincible ignorance is concerned, we are\npardoned.\n3.3 William of Ockham: New Directions in the Understanding of Synderesis and Conscience\n\nWith the fourteenth-century theologian William of Ockham\n(1285\u20131347) we encounter some radically new developments on the\ntopics of synderesis and conscience. While Ockham\u2019s Franciscan\npredecessor John Duns Scotus had disagreements with Aquinas about the\nnature of the moral law, Scotus fundamentally agreed with the\nDominican in viewing synderesis and conscience a habit and an act of\nthe practical reason, respectively, whose jobs were to apprehend the\nbasic principles of morality in the case of synderesis, and to apply\nthem in the case of conscience (John Duns Scotus, Ordinatio\n2, d. 39; Wolter trans. 1997: 162\u2013163). Like Scotus, Ockham also\nagrees with Aquinas in several crucial respects. Where Ockham departs\nfrom Aquinas, and indeed with the entire scholastic tradition which\npreceded him, however, is in his abandonment of the concept of\nsynderesis, and in his unique approach to the invincibly erroneous\nconscience.\n\nIt is difficult to know for certain why Ockham abandoned the concept\nof synderesis. Michael Baylor, however, has suggested two\npossibilities. The first is that, as we have seen, synderesis was\nregarded by Ockham\u2019s predecessors, like Aquinas, as an inborn\nhabit. But for Ockham, rational agents only come to possess habits by\nacquiring them, and they can only acquire them by doing the relevant\nacts repeatedly. The notion that a habit could be innate, then, would\nhave seemed incoherent to Ockham (Baylor 1977: 78; Fuchs 1952:\n5\u20136).\n\nThe second possible explanation\u2014though Baylor thinks this\nimplausible\u2014has to do with the way that Ockham understands the\nfoundations of morality as compared with Aquinas. For Ockham, there is\nno essential connection between the moral order as it currently exists\nand the divine wisdom. The highest norm of morality is the divine\nwill. It just so happens that murder, for example, is wrong today. But\nthere is no reason that God could not make murder right tomorrow if he\nso willed. The moral order, in short, is contingent. On the Thomistic\nview, however, the natural law is a participation in the eternal law.\nIt is the point of contact between God\u2019s plan for us as\nconceived in the divine mind, on the one hand, and the human\nintellect, on the other. Synderesis, as we saw above, plays a key role\nin this connection insofar as it grasps the moral principles that lead\nhuman beings to their final destiny. Moreover, the moral principles\nthat guide us in how to achieve our final end are as true today as\nthey were yesterday, and indeed will be for all time, owing to the\nnatures that God has bestowed upon us. As Baylor writes:\n\n\nAs the element of man\u2019s original nature which was substantially\nundamaged after Adam\u2019s fall, the synteresis was the\nanthropological point of connection between an abiding moral order,\nwhich manifested ideas in the divine intellect according to which\ncreation was necessarily ordered, and man\u2019s certain knowledge of\nuniversal principles of that moral order. Ockham, however, stressed\nthe absolute contingency of creation [\u2026] For Ockham,\nGod\u2019s will, as manifested in the moral precepts he has ordained,\nconstitutes the ultimate and objective norm of morality. God is under\nno obligation; rather, it is divine will which determines moral\nobligation. This awesome conception of divine liberty and omnipotence,\nand the contingency of the created order has led many to the\nconclusion that the objective basis of Ockham\u2019s ethics is\nauthoritarian or positivistic and inherently unstable since it appears\nto depend only upon an alterable divine fiat. If this were so, then it\nwould appear odd also to posit within man an inborn and inalienable\nknowledge of moral principles in the form of synteresis.\n(Baylor 1977: 79\u201380)\n\n\nA distinguished proponent of the interpretation Baylor describes was\nServais Pinckaers. Because the foundations of morality are rooted in\nthe divine will, which can change, there was no need for Ockham to\nresort to a mechanism that discovers the eternal principles of\nmorality as these emerge from human nature since, for Ockham, no such\nprinciples exist. Rather, according to Pinckaers\u2019 interpretation\nof Ockham, moral principles are known through revelation. (Pinckaers\n1993: 258). While Pinckaers was correct in his assessment of\nOckham\u2019s metaethics\u2014which is fundamentally authoritarian\ndespite elements of rationalism\u2014he was wrong in his\ncharacterization of Ockham\u2019s moral epistemology. This is\nbecause, while it is indeed possible to come to know the principles of\nmorality via divine revelation, on Ockham\u2019s account, it is also\npossible, despite their grounding in God\u2019s will, to come to know\nthem via natural reason and experience (see Eardley 2013:\n82\u201387). Examples of the former, that is, of principles that are\nself-evidently true, are \u201cevery blameworthy evil is to be\navoided\u201d and \u201cthe will ought to conform itself to right\nreason\u201d. An example of a moral proposition that is grounded in\nexperience, on the other hand, is \u201can angry man should be calmed\nwith soothing words\u201d (Eardley 2013: 86\u201387). God obviously\nwills that we should follow such injunctions. But how can we know his\nwill if not through revelation? Although the contemporary philosopher\nPeter Geach was not a particularly sympathetic reader of Ockham, he\nwas willing to concede the possibility that a metaethics grounded in\ndivine commands could nonetheless yield a naturalistic moral\nepistemology. As he put it:\n\n\nthe rational recognition that a practice is generally undesirable and\nthat it is best for people on the whole not even to think of resorting\nto it is thus in fact a promulgation to a man of the Divine law\nforbidding the practice, even if he does not realise that this is a\npromulgation of the Divine law, even if he does not believe there is a\nGod. (Geach 1981: 170)\n\n\nOckham would have agreed.\n\nA second and related way in which Pinckaers misinterpreted\nOckham\u2019s moral epistemology was Pinckaers\u2019 assumption\nthat, because Ockham discarded the traditional notion of synderesis,\nhe must have done the same for its twin concept of conscience.\nPinckaers conceded that moral principles, even if rooted in the divine\nwill, still need to be applied to particular situations on\nOckham\u2019s account. This role was, of course, reserved for\nconscience in the earlier tradition. In Ockham, according to\nPinckaers, this role now became associated with practical reason and\nprudence (Pinckaers 1993: 259).\n\nA closer reading of the textual evidence suggests that Ockham very\nmuch made use of the traditional concept of conscience. Indeed, much\nof how he employed the concept was consistent with the tradition,\nespecially as articulated by Aquinas. Ockham associates the dictates\nof practical reason, for example, with judgements of conscience. He is\nalso emphatic in his belief that rational agents have an absolute\nobligation to follow their consciences, which can be correct or\nerroneous (Quaestiones variae, q. 8, a. 1, OTh 8: 411). A\nconscience is correct when it is in accord with right reason; it is\nerroneous when it is not. Finally, an erroneous conscience, for\nOckham, as with Aquinas, is either in a state of\nvincible\u2014voluntary and therefore culpable\u2014ignorance, or in\na state of invincible\u2014or involuntary\u2014ignorance. Where\nconscience is in a state of vincible ignorance, we must do our best to\nset it aside. In all these cases Ockham follows the tradition, with\none exception: that of the invincibly erroneous conscience (Eardley\n2013: 94\u201398), the state in which the agent finds himself with\nthe correct universal principles, but non-culpably errs with respect\nto his grasp of the circumstances in which he finds himself.\n\nIn what sense does Ockham depart from the tradition? For Ockham, the\nact of following an invincibly erroneous conscience is not merely\nexcusable, as it was For Aquinas, but \u201cvirtuous and\nmeritorious\u201d. Consider the following example from Ockham. While\nwalking down the street one day you pass a homeless person who asks\nyou for money. He appears to have a moral claim on you since you\nassent to the moral principle that \u201chelp is to be given to every\nneedy person in extreme need lest he die\u201d. Does he appear needy,\nand indeed desperate to you? Yes. Sizing him up, you determine that,\nalthough it is theoretically possible that he could be fraud, this\nseems unlikely. For Ockham, you are obliged in this instance to follow\nyour conscience, and indeed you do. It turns out, however, that this\napparent homeless person is in fact a very wealthy person who is\nimpersonating a beggar. For Ockham, in following your conscience, you\nare not merely excused or absolved of your error, but your (ignorant)\nact is virtuous and, indeed, regarded by God as meritorious (so long,\nthat is, that your act of charity is done out of love for God). As\nOckham puts it:\n\n\nConsequently, [in the above case] a right act of the will and an error\nof the intellect remain at the same time with respect to the same\nobject. And the whole reason is because that error is not in the power\nof the one who is mistaken, who took all due diligence to find out the\ntruth, and therefore that error excuses from every sin. And\nconsequently, the will that elicits the act in conformity to such\n[invincibly] erroneous reason acts virtuously and meritoriously.\nIndeed, had he not, while in such error, willed to help that person,\nhe would have performed a vicious and demeritorious act because such\nan act would have been knowingly elicited against conscience and\nagainst non-culpable reason, because in the aforementioned case he\ndoes not know that he is in error but believes that he possesses right\nreason, and consequently by despising reason [in this way] he sins\nmortally. (Quaestiones varie q. 8, a. 2, Oth 8:\n423\u2013424)\n\n\nWhat is motivating Ockham\u2019s novel suggestion? Even Aquinas\nadmitted that we have an obligation to follow our consciences, whether\nright or erroneous. When we do not do so, according to Aquinas, we\nsin. Of course, when our consciences are in a state of voluntary or\nvincible ignorance we also have a duty to put aside our error,\notherwise we sin. It is obviously not possible, however, to put error\naside in the case of invincible ignorance since such ignorance is by\ndefinition involuntary. Accordingly, for Aquinas, we are obliged to\nfollow such a conscience. Although we act wrongly, in such cases, we\nare, for Aquinas, excused on the grounds that we could not have known\nbetter. To return to Aquinas\u2019s example of inadvertently sleeping\nwith someone who is not your spouse: this might be excusable, for\nAquinas, but there is no possibility that such an act might be\nconsidered virtuous, much less meritorious. But for Ockham, if it is\nvicious and therefore punishable not to follow an invincibly\nerroneous conscience, then merely being excused for following it when\nwe are under a moral obligation to do so would be an insufficient\nreward. Rather, it should logically follow that it is virtuous and\ntherefore meritorious.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Augustine, <em>City of God</em>, translated by Henry Bettenson,\nHarmondsworth: Penguin, 1972.", "Bonaventure, \u201cCommentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s <em>Books\nof \u2018Judgements\u2019</em> 2:39\u201d, in Potts1980:\n110\u2013121. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511609022.013", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, \u201cConscience and Synderesis\u201d,\ntranslated by A.S.
