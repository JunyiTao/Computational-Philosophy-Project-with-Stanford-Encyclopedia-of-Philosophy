    "main_text": "Philosophical Principles || Ontology\n3.3 Ontology\n\nThe standard view of Heraclitus\u2019 ontology since Aristotle is\nthat he is a material monist who holds that fire is the ultimate\nreality; all things are just manifestations of fire. According to\nAristotle the Milesians in general were material monists who advocated\nother kinds of ultimate matter: Thales water, Anaximander the\nboundless, Anaximenes air (Metaphysics 983b6\u2013984a8). So\nHeraclitus\u2019 theory was just another version of a common\nbackground theory. There are problems already with Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of the Milesians: Aristotle lacks any textual evidence\nfor Thales\u2019 view and must reconstruct it out of almost nothing;\nhe sometimes treats Anaximander as a pluralist like Anaxagoras who\nthinks the boundless is a mixture of qualities; at most Anaximenes\nmight exemplify material monism\u2013but Plato reads him as a\npluralist (Timaeus 39 with Graham 2003b; Graham 2003a). In\nthe case of Heraclitus, his own statements make material monism\nproblematic as an interpretation. According to material monism, some\nkind of matter is the ultimate reality, and any variation in the world\nconsists merely of qualitative or possibly quantitative change in it;\nfor there is only one reality, for instance fire, which can never come\ninto existence or perish, but can only change in its appearances.\nHeraclitus, however, advocates a radical kind of change:\n\nFor souls it is death to become water, for water death to become\nearth, but from earth water is born, and from water soul. (B36)\n\n\n(Here soul seems to occupy the place of fire.) The language of birth\nand death in the world of living things is precisely the language used\nin Greek metaphysics for coming to be and perishing. It implies a\nradical transformation that rules out continuing identity (cf. B76,\nB62). Indeed, interpreters of Heraclitus cannot have it both ways:\nHeraclitus cannot be both a believer in radical flux (the change of\neverything into everything else: fire into water, water into earth,\nand so on) and an advocate of monism. Either he must believe in a\nmerely illusory or at most a limited kind of change, or he must be a\npluralist. \n\nOne further difficulty remains for the monist reading. In his alleged\nversion of monism, fire is the ultimate reality. Yet fire (as the\nancients recognized) is the least substantial and the most evanescent\nof elemental stuffs. It makes a better symbol of change than of\npermanence. Other alleged cases of material monism offer a basic kind\nof matter that could arguably be stable and permanent over long\nperiods of time; but fire manifests \u201cneed and satiety\u201d\n(B65), a kind of ongoing consumption that can live only by devouring\nfuel. Is not Heraclitus\u2019 choice of a basic reality itself\nparadoxical? At best his appeal to fire seems to draw on material\nmonism in a way that points beyond the theory to an account in which\nthe process of change is more real than the material substances that\nundergo change.\n",
