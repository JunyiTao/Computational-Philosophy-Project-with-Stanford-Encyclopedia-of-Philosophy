    "main_text": "The Ergodic Hierarchy and Chaos\n7. The Ergodic Hierarchy and Chaos\n\nThe question of how to characterise chaos has been\ncontroversially discussed ever since the inception of chaos theory;\nfor a survey see Smith (1998, Ch. 10). An important family of\napproaches defines chaos using EH. Belot and Earman (1997, 155) state\nthat being strong mixing is a necessary condition and being a K-system\nis a sufficient condition for a system to be chaotic. The view that\nbeing a K-system is the mark of chaos and that any lower degree of\nrandomness is not chaotic is frequently motivated by two ideas. The\nfirst is the idea that chaotic behaviour involves dynamical\ninstability in the form of exponential divergence of nearby\ntrajectories. Thus, since a system involves an exponential divergence\nof nearby trajectories only if it is a K-system, it is concluded that\n(merely) ergodic and mixing systems are not chaotic whereas K- and\nB-systems are. It is noteworthy, however, that SM is compatible with\nthere being polynomial divergence of nearby trajectories and that such\ndivergence sometimes exceeds exponential divergence in the short run.\nThus, if chaos is to be closely associated with the rate of divergence\nof nearby trajectories, there seems to be no good reason to deny that\nSM systems exhibit chaotic behaviour.\n\nThe second common motivation for the view that being a K-system is the\nmark of chaos is the idea that the shift from zero to positive\nKS-entropy marks the transition from a \u2018regular\u2019 to\n\u2018chaotic\u2019 behaviour. This may suggest that having positive\nKS-entropy is both necessary and sufficient condition for chaotic\nbehaviour. Thus, since K-systems have positive KS-entropy while SM\nsystems don\u2019t, it is concluded that K-systems are chaotic\nwhereas SM-systems are not. Why is KS-entropy a mark of chaos? There\nare three motivations, corresponding to three different\ninterpretations of KS-entropy. First, KS-entropy could be interpreted\nas entailing dynamical instability in the sense of having nearby\ndivergence of nearby trajectories (see Lichtenberg & Liebermann,\n1992, p. 304). Second, KS-entropy could be connected to algorithmic\ncomplexity (Brudno 1978). Yet, while such a complexity is sometimes\nmentioned as an indication of chaos, it is more difficult to connect\nit to physical intuitions about chaos. Third, KS-entropy could be\ninterpreted as a generalized version of Shannon\u2019s information\ntheoretic entropy (see Frigg 2004). According to this approach,\npositive KS-entropy entails a certain degree of unpredictability,\nwhich is sufficiently high to deserve the title\n chaotic.[24]\n\nWerndl (2009b) argues that a careful review of all systems that one\ncommonly regards as chaotic shows that strong mixing is the crucial\ncriterion: a system is chaotic just in case it is strong mixing. As\nshe is careful to point out, this claim needs to be qualified: systems\nare rarely mixing on the entire phase space, but neither are they\nchaotic on the entire phase space. The crucial move is to restrict\nattention to those regions of phase space where the system is chaotic,\nand it then turns out that in these same regions the systems are also\nstrong mixing. Hence Werndl concludes that strong mixing is the\nhallmark of chaos. And surprisingly this is true also of dissipative\nsystems (i.e., systems that are not measure preserving). These systems\nhave attractors, and they are chaotic on their attractors rather than\non the entire phase space. The crucial point then is that one can\ndefine an invariant (preserved) measure on the attractor and\nshow that the system is strongly mixing with respect to that measure.\nSo strong mixing can define chaos in both conservative and dissipative\nsystems.\n\nThe search for necessary and sufficient conditions for chaos\npresupposes that there is a clear-cut divide between chaotic and\nnon-chaotic systems. EH may challenge this view, as every attempt to\ndraw a line somewhere to demarcate the chaotic from non-chaotic\nsystems is bound to be somewhat arbitrary. Ergodic systems are pretty\nregular, mixing systems are less regular and the higher positions in\nthe hierarchy exhibit still more haphazard behaviour. But is there one\nparticular point where the transition from \u2018non-chaos\u2019 to\nchaos takes place? Based on the argument that EH is a hierarchy of\nincreasing degrees of randomness and degrees of randomness correspond\nto different degrees of unpredictability (see Section 5), Berkovitz,\nFrigg and Kronz (2006, Section 5.3) suggest that chaos may well be\nviewed as a matter of degree rather than an all-or-nothing affair.\nBernoulli systems are very chaotic, K-systems are slightly less\nchaotic, SM-systems are still less chaotic, and ergodic systems are\nnon-chaotic. This suggestion connects well with the idea that chaos is\nclosely related to unpredictability.\n\nThe ergodic hierarchy has also been used to understand quantum chaos.\nCastagnino and Lombardi (2007) analyze the problem of quantum chaos as\na particular case of the classical limit of quantum mechanics and\nidentify mixing in the classical limit as the condition that a quantum\nsystem must satisfy to be nonintegrable. Gomez and Castagnino (2014,\n2015) generalize the entire ergodic hierarchy to the quantum context\nand argue that EH thus generalized is a helpful tool to understand\nquantum chaos; Fortin and Lombardi (2018) use EH to understand\ndecoherence; and Gomez (2018) discusses the KS entropy in quantum\nmixing systems.\n\nMixing, finally, has also been invoked in understanding the effects of\nstructural model error. Frigg, Bradley, Du and Smith (2014) argue that\nthe distinction between parameter error and structural model error is\ncrucial, and that the latter has significant and hitherto\nunappreciated impact on the predictive ability of a model. Wilson-Mayo\n(2015) points out that to put this observation on a solid foundation\nwe need a notion of structural chaos. He proposes such a notion by\nappealing to topological mixing. \n",
