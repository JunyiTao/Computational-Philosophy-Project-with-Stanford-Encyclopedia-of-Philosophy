    "main_text": "Mental aspects of aesthetic experience || Emotion\n2.4 Emotion\n\nEmotion has been taken to be central to aesthetic experience since\nearly work on aesthetics as such in the eighteenth century. In France,\nthe influential Abb\u00e9 Jean-Baptiste Du Bos (1719 [1748])\nemphasized the importance of occurrent, bodily emotion in our\nappreciation of drama. This emotion is pleasant in comparison to the\nlanguor of everyday life (cf. discussion in Hume, \u201cOf\ntragedy,\u201d 1757 [1987b]). In Germany, Georg Friedrich Meier\n(1999) treated the passions as essential to the pleasure we take in\naesthetic experience, and Mendelssohn (1785 [1979])\u2014after\nDubos\u2014added that part of why this is pleasurable is that we feel\na certain salutary effect on the body in having emotion in aesthetic\nexperience. Although Baumgarten (1735 [1954]) wrote more generally\nabout aesthetics as the science of cognition of objects by sensation,\nhe also specified in the case of poetry in particular that one central\ngoal is \u201cto arouse affects\u201d (\u00a7XXV, p. 24).\n\nWith the rise of Romanticism and then of empathy theory, artists and\nphilosophers were particularly concerned to clarify the ways in which\naesthetic experience involved feeling an emotion alongside that\nexpressed in an artwork (see Section 1.4 above). It is possible to\ntake aesthetic experience to be singularly focused on emotional\nexpression without claiming that the appreciator of an aesthetic\nobject actually needs to feel the emotion that object expresses\n(Langer 1953). Nonetheless, many views of expression did indeed think\nthat an appropriate aesthetic experience involved feeling that\nexpressed emotion (Bosanquet 1915, Collingwood 1938 [1958], Wollheim\n1990). On a view that takes aesthetic experience essentially to\ninvolve appreciating expression of emotion, and which also takes such\nappreciation essentially to involve feeling that emotion,\nfeeling some emotion or other is essential to aesthetic experience.\nBut the emotion in question varies from case to case, depending on\nwhat the aesthetic object expresses.\n\nA distinct influential view has it that there is one consistent\ndistinctive \u201caesthetic emotion\u201d felt in all aesthetic\nexperience of any object whatsoever. A version of this thought G.E.\nMoore\u2019s brief remarks on aesthetic experience in Principia\nEthica (1903 [1993]; cf. Guyer 2014c pp. 112\u20133): \u201cIt\nis not sufficient that a man should merely see the beautiful qualities\nin a picture and know that they are beautiful, in order that we may\ngive his state of mind the highest praise. We require that he should\nalso appreciate the beauty of that which he sees \u2026 he\nshould have an appropriate emotion towards the beautiful qualities\nwhich he cognizes\u201d (\u00a7113). But the idea of a distinctive\naesthetic emotion is perhaps most closely associated with\nMoore\u2019s friend Clive Bell (1914 [2007]), who took the goodness\nof art to be a matter of its ability to rouse us to a \u201cstate of\necstasy\u201d by its \u201csignificant form\u201d (cf. Dean 1996).\nBell explicitly called this \u201cpeculiar emotion provoked by works\nof art\u201d an \u201caesthetic emotion.\u201d\n\nBell presumed so much agreement on this point that he said little\nabout what this emotion is, leading to much criticism (e.g.\nStolnitz 1960, p. 144). Nelson Goodman (1968 [1976]) claimed that this\noversight meant that Bell had little or no available distinction\nbetween non-aesthetic and aesthetic experience: \u201cThe theory of\naesthetic phlogiston explains everything and nothing\u201d (p.247).\nMore recently, Jesse Prinz (2014) has suggested that we understand the\naesthetic emotion in question as a form of wonder (see Carroll 2019\nfor objections).\n\nAfter Bell, Dewey (1934 [1980]) and Collingwood (1938 [1958]) took\nmore moderate positions on the nature of a specific aesthetic emotion.\nBoth thought that aesthetic experiences were colored distinctively by\ntheir own variable emotions, but also that there is a distinctive\naffect in common across all aesthetic experiences. Dewey claimed that\nthis affect was a matter of \u201cqualitative unity\u201d of an\nexperience (1938 [1980], pp. 84\u20135), and Collingwood that it was\n\u201cthe specific feeling of having successfully expressed\nourselves\u201d (1938 [1958], p. 117).\n\nAll the views discussed in this section thus far share the claim that\nsome emotion or other is essential to aesthetic experience. There are\nother views on which emotion is a common concomitant of aesthetic\nexperience, but that it does not make aesthetic experience what it is\n(e.g. Vivas 1937). Goodman (1968 [1976]) insisted that \u201cin\naesthetic experience the emotions function cognitively\n\u2026 Cognitive use involves discriminating and relating them in\norder to gauge and grasp the work and integrate it with the rest of\nour experience and the world\u201d (p.248). According to Goodman,\nsuch cognitively purposed emotions need not be present in aesthetic\nexperience, and they are sometimes present in non-aesthetic experience\ntoo (p.251).\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that two of the most important historical\ntheories of aesthetic experience make the now rare claim that emotion\nis positively incompatible with aesthetic experience. Kant (1789), for\ninstance, claimed that \u201ca pure judgment of\ntaste\u201d\u2014that which you would make in an aesthetic\nexperience of pure beauty\u2014\u201cis independent of charm and\nemotion\u201d (p.68). Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) thought of emotion\nas wrapped up in motive and will, in its striving or frustration, but\nalso claimed that aesthetic experience offered complete release from\nsuch striving and frustration. As such, aesthetic experience does not\ninvolve emotion as we ordinarily understand it. Nonetheless,\nSchopenhauer did indeed notice the importance of emotional expression\nto certain arts, and he conceded that some of those general\n\u201cIdeas\u201d we can come to understand in the course of\naesthetic experience are ideas of emotions and \u201ctheir essential\nnature, without any accessories, and so also without the motives for\nthem\u201d (\u00a752, p. 260).\n",
