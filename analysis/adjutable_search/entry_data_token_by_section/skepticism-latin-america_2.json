Skepticism rediscovered\n\nThe study and diffusion of skepticism in Argentina and in other\ncountries such as Brazil and Mexico owes a great deal to Ezequiel de\nOlaso. When Olaso died, Porchat noted that, despite not being a\nskeptic himself, Olaso \u201cwas indeed the father of Brazilian\nskepticism\u201d (Porchat 1997). But his leadership and influence was\nvast, as Popkin testified:\n\n\nEzequiel de Olaso was one of the most prominent historians of\nphilosophy. He contributed enormously to arousing interest in a wide\nrange of topics in the history of philosophy through his writings, his\nteachings and his lectures in Latin America, North America and Europe.\n(Popkin 1997)\n\n\nOlaso taught in many universities both in Argentina and elsewhere. His\nPh.D. dissertation has not been published, but many papers resulted\nfrom it. Olaso wrote a number of important papers on skepticism, both\nancient and modern. He explored many authors in the 17th\nand 18th centuries: Hume, Benito Jer\u00f3nimo\nFeij\u00f3o, Rousseau, Hobbes, and Leibniz. These developments were\nsummarized in Olaso 1994. Many of his papers are dedicated to\nHume\u2019s skepticism. Olaso argued that Hume was an Academic\nskeptic, not a Pyrrhonist, as Popkin had supposed. More importantly,\nhis study of certain Enlightenment authors made Popkin revise his\ninterpretation that, apart from Hume, there was no interest at all in\nskepticism during the 18th century.\n\nOlaso\u2019s work was not limited to the presence of skepticism in\nmodern philosophy. He also devoted his efforts to interpret certain\nconcepts of the main lexicon of skepticism. He was not only interested\nin skepticism from a historical point of view, but also from a\nphilosophical perspective: he argued vigorously against the coherence\nof the skeptical position in \u201cZ\u00e9tesis\u201d (Olaso 1988)\na detailed paper on ancient Pyrrhonism, in which he displayed both an\naccurate understanding of this philosophical stance and a highly\ncritical attitude toward the Pyrrhonian conception of investigation.\nHis assessment of the concept of z\u00e9tesis was very\ninfluential. Olaso interpreted it as an inquiry whose goal was\nsuspension of judgment, which defined Pyrrhonism, and contrasted it to\nthe open inquiry led by Academic and modern skeptics, whose goal is\ntruth. Among his contributions, one finds also the distinction between\nthe concept of doubt, or suspension of the mind, and the\nconcept of epokh\u00e9, or suspension of judgment, which\nwould be the proper attitude of a skeptic, because it is beyond doubt\nitself and tries to overcome it. These new interpretations were part\nof his debate with scholars like Naess, Chisholm, Mates, Frede and, of\ncourse, Porchat in order to find an acceptable form of contemporary\nskepticism. Based on Ortega y Gasset\u2019s distinction between\nbelief and knowledge, he proposed new accounts of Moore\u2019s\nnotions of common sense and certainty (Olaso 1975a) and the critical\nanalysis carried out by Wittgenstein (Olaso 1999).\n\nOlaso\u2019s work on skepticism opened up two main directions that\nwere followed by many philosophers, whether under his direct influence\nor not. First, skepticism emerged as an epistemological problem and,\nin the light of the linguistic turn, he set the task of reinterpreting\nand making sense of this philosophical stance. Second, he initiated a\nscholarly investigation of the history of skepticism; particularly of\nmodern skepticism, but also both versions of its ancient form.\n",
