    "main_text": "The Place of Hegel\u2019s Social and Political Thought || The Philosophy of Right\n1.4 The Philosophy of Right\n\nHegel\u2019s main work of social and political thought was the\nPR. It was published in 1821 when Hegel taught in Berlin. This\nentry surveys his primary contributions in this work, but with\nreference to his other texts and political writings.\n\nHegel says the PR \u201cis a more extensive\u201d\nexposition of \u201cObjective Spirit,\u201d a section within his\nphilosophical system called his Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical\nSciences (see PM). The relevant sections of\nthe Encyclopaedia were intended to accompany the lectures that\nbecame published as the Philosophy of Right. The full\nEncyclopaedia begins with an examination of logic and then\napplies itself to an understanding of nature and the human spirit,\nwhere the latter incorporates analyses of psychology, art, history,\nreligion and philosophy in addition to social and political\nthought.\n\nHis approach to form and content is unique. The PR is\nmostly divided into numbered sections (\u00a7). These are occasionally\nsupplemented by later Remarks (R) where Hegel elaborated further in a\nlater edition or Additions (A) which took the form of edited lecture\nnotes of what Hegel had said by his students when teaching the\nPR. Hegel argues his positions in a dialectical way that is\nnot linear and designed to show how seemingly different perspectives\ncan have their opposition somehow dissolve within a new and higher\nperspective.\n\nFor example, our first apperception of some thing or object of\nthought might be as a pure being. As it is pure, it may appear to lack\ndeterminations \u2013 and so be nothing. In this way, Hegel holds that\nour thought has moved from pure being to pure nothingness. But yet what\nwe apperceive is a something and so this is seen as helping overcome\nthe false opposition of pure being and nothingness to a new, higher\ncategory of becoming as what is before is taking further shape as we\nsharpen our grasp of it. This dialectical method is infused throughout\nthe PR and Hegel says he has \u201cpresupposed a\nfamiliarity\u201d with his approach found in his logic and wider\nsystem (PR, p. 10, see SL, EL).\n\nSimilarly, the PR moves from basic building blocks that\nhave a somewhat \u201cpure\u201d nature not yet grounded in reality\nto their negation and then brought together in a higher, concrete\nreality. After an introduction establishing the PR as\nprimarily a work concerned with freedom, the PR is divided\ninto three parts. The first pure part is Abstract Right covering\nproperty and punishment followed by an opposite in Morality covering\nissues of conscience and moral responsibility. They become unified in a\nfinal part Ethical Life providing a more concrete reality that examines\nthe family, civil society, law, the state and ending with war and\ninternational relations. Each part shall be discussed in turn.\n",
