    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality\n2. Notions of Intrinsicality\n\nA number of different distinctions have been called the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction. As J. Michael Dunn (1990) notes, some\nauthors have used \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nto mean \u2018essential\u2019 and \u2018accidental\u2019. Dunn is\nsurely right in saying that this is a misuse of the terms. A more\ninteresting distinction is noted by Brian Ellis (1991; discussed in\nHumberstone 1996: 206). (See also Figdor 2008 and Figdor 2014 for a\ndiscussion of a related notion of intrinsicality.) Ellis suggests we\nshould distinguish between properties that objects have independently\nof any outside forces acting on them (what we will call the\nEllis-intrinsic properties), and those that they have in virtue of\nthose outside forces (the Ellis-extrinsic properties). For many\nobjects (such as, say, a stretched rubber band) their shape will be\ndependent on the outside forces acting on them, so their shape will be\nEllis-extrinsic. If one is committed to the idea that shapes are\nintrinsic, one should think this means that the distinction between\nthe Ellis-intrinsic and Ellis-extrinsic properties is not the same as\nthe intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. Such a judgement may seem a\nlittle hasty, but in any case we will turn now to distinctions that\nhave received more attention in the philosophical literature.\n",
