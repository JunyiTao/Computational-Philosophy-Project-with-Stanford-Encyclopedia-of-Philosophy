In the eight years following the\nIraq invasion in 2003, half a million deaths were either directly or\nindirectly caused by the war (Hagopian et al. 2013). Direct casualties\nfrom the Second World War numbered over 60 million, about 3 per cent\nof the world\u2019s population. War\u2019s environmental costs are\nless commonly researched, but are obviously also extraordinary (Austin\nand Bruch 2000). Armed forces use fuels in Olympian quantities: in the\nyears from 2000\u20132013, the US Department of Defense accounted for\naround 80% of US federal government energy usage, between 0.75 and 1\nquadrillion BTUs per year\u2014a little less than all the\nenergy use that year in Denmark and Bulgaria, a little more than\nSlovakia and Serbia (Energy Information Administration 2015a,b). They\nalso directly and indirectly destroy habitats and natural\nresources\u2014consider, for example, the Gulf war oil spill (El-Baz\nand Makharita 1994). For both our planet and its inhabitants, wars are\ntruly among the very worst things we can do.\n\nWar can be necessary and proportionate only if it serves an end worth\nall this death and destruction. Hence the importance of having a just\ncause. And hence too the widespread belief that just causes are few\nand far between. Indeed, traditional just war theory recognizes only\ntwo kinds of justification for war: national defence (of one\u2019s\nown state or of an ally) and humanitarian intervention. What\u2019s\nmore, humanitarian intervention is permissible only to avert the very\ngravest of tragedies\u2014\u201ccrimes that shock the moral\nconscience of mankind\u201d (Walzer 2006: 107).\n\nWalzer argued that states\u2019 claims to sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity are grounded in the human rights of their citizens, in three\nways. First, states ensure individual security. Rights to life and\nliberty have value \u201conly if they also have dimension\u201d\n(Walzer 2006: 58), which they derive from states\u2019\nborders\u2014\u201cwithin that world, men and women\u2026 are safe\nfrom attack; once the lines are crossed, safety is gone\u201d (Walzer\n2006: 57). Second, states protect a common life, made by their\ncitizens over centuries of interaction. If the common life of a\npolitical community is valued by its citizens, then it is worth\nfighting for. Third, they have also formed a political association, an\norganic social contract, whereby individuals have, over time and in\ninformal ways, conceded aspects of their liberty to the community, to\nsecure greater freedom for all.\n\nThese arguments for national defence are double-edged. They helped\nexplain why wars of national defence are permissible, but also make\njustifying humanitarian intervention harder. One can in principle\nsuccessfully conclude a war in defence of oneself or one's allies without any lasting\ndamage to the political sovereignty or territorial integrity of any of\nthe contending parties. In Walzer\u2019s view, humanitarian\ninterventions, in which one typically defends people against their own\nstate, necessarily undermine political sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity. So they must meet a higher burden of justification.\n\nWalzer\u2019s traditionalist stances on national defence and\nhumanitarian intervention met heavy criticism. Early sceptics (Doppelt\n1978; Beitz 1980; Luban 1980a) challenged Walzer\u2019s appeal to the\nvalue of collective freedom, noting that in diverse political\ncommunities freedom for the majority can mean oppression for the\nminority (see also Caney 2006). In modern states, can we even speak of\na single common life? Even if we can, do wars really threaten it,\nbesides in extreme cases? And even if our common life and culture were\nthreatened, would their defence really justify killing innocent\npeople?\n\nCritics also excoriated Walzer\u2019s appeal to individual rights\n(see especially Wasserstrom 1978; Luban 1980b). They questioned the\nnormative purchase of his metaphor of the organic social contract (if\nhypothetical contracts aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re not\nwritten on, then what are metaphorical contracts worth?). They\nchallenged his claim that states guarantee individual security: most\nobviously, when humanitarian intervention seems warranted, the state\nis typically the greatest threat to its members.\n\nDavid Rodin (2002) advanced the quintessentially reductivist critique\nof Walzer, showing that his attempt to ground state defence in\nindividual defensive rights could not succeed. He popularized the\n\u201cbloodless invasion objection\u201d to this argument for\nnational defensive rights. Suppose an unjustly aggressing army would\nsecure its objectives without loss of life if only the victim state\noffers no resistance (the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003\ninvasion of Iraq, arguably meet this description, as might some of\nRussia\u2019s territorial expansions). If the right of national\ndefence is grounded in states\u2019 members\u2019 rights to\nsecurity, then in these cases there would be no right of national\ndefence, because their lives are at risk only if the victim state\nfights back. And yet we typically do think it permissible to fight\nagainst annexation and regime change.\n\nBy undermining the value of sovereignty, revisionists lowered the bar\nagainst intervening militarily in other states. Often these arguments\nwere directly linked: some think that if states cannot protect the\nsecurity of their members, then they lack any rights to sovereignty\nthat a military intervention could undermine (Shue\n 1997).[11]\n Caney (2005) argues that military intervention could be permissible\nwere it to serve individual human rights better than non-intervention.\nOthers countenance so-called \u201credistributive wars\u201d, fought\non behalf of the global poor to force rich states to address the\nwidespread violations of fundamental human rights caused by their\neconomic policies (Luban 1980b; Fabre 2012; Lippert-Rasmussen 2013;\n\u00d8verland 2013).\n\nOther philosophers, equally unpersuaded by Walzer\u2019s arguments,\nnonetheless reject a substantively revisionist take on just cause. If\nthe individual self-defence-based view of jus ad bellum\ncannot justify lethal defence against \u201clesser aggression\u201d,\nthen we could follow Rodin (2014), and argue for radically\nrevisionist conclusions about just cause; or we could instead reject\nthe individual self-defence-based approach to justifying killing in\nwar (Emerton and Handfield 2014; Lazar 2014).\n\nSome think we can solve the \u201cproblem of lesser aggression\u201d\nby invoking the importance of deterrence, as well as the impossibility\nof knowing for sure that aggression will be bloodless (Fabre 2014).\nOthers think that we must take proper account of people\u2019s\ninterest in having a democratically elected, or at least home-grown,\ngovernment, to justify national defence. On one popular account,\nalthough no individual could permissibly kill to protect her own\n\u201cpolitical interests\u201d, when enough people are threatened,\ntheir aggregated interests justify going to war (Hurka 2007; Frowe\n2014). Counterintuitively, this means that more populous states have,\nother things equal, more expansive rights of national defence.\nHowever, perhaps states have a group right to national defence, which\nrequires only that a sufficient number of individuals have the\nrelevant political interests\u2014any excess over the threshold is\nmorally irrelevant. Many already think about national\nself-determination in this way: the population of the group seeking\nindependence has to be sufficiently large before we take their claim\nseriously, but differences above that threshold matter much less\n(Margalit and Raz 1990).\n\nThe revisionist take on humanitarian intervention might also have some\ntroubling results. If sovereignty and territorial integrity matter\nlittle, then shouldn\u2019t we use military force more often? As Kutz\n(2014) has argued, revisionist views on national defence might license\nthe kind of military adventurism that went so badly wrong in Iraq,\nwhere states have so little regard for sovereignty that they go to war\nto improve the domestic political institutions of their\nadversaries.\n\nWe can resolve this worry in one of two ways. First, recall just how\ninfrequently military intervention succeeds. Since it so often not\nonly fails, but actually makes things worse, we should use it only\nwhen the ongoing crimes are so severe that we would take any risk to\ntry to stop them.\n\nSecond, perhaps the political interests underpinning the state\u2019s\nright to national defence are not simply interests in being part of an\nideal liberal democracy, but in being governed by, very broadly,\nmembers of one\u2019s own nation, or perhaps even an interest in\ncollective self-determination. This may take us back to Walzer\u2019s\n\u201cromance of the nation-state\u201d, but people clearly do care\nabout something like this. Unless we want to restrict rights of\nnational defence to liberal democracies alone (bearing in mind how few\nof them there are in the world), we have to recognize that our\npolitical interests are not all exclusively liberal-democratic.\n\nWhat of redistributive wars? Too often arguments on this topic\nartfully distinguish between just cause and other conditions of\njus ad bellum (Fabre 2012). Even when used by powerful states\nagainst weak adversaries, military force is rarely a moral triumph. It\ntends to cause more problems than it solves. Redistributive wars, as\nfought on behalf of the \u201cglobal poor\u201d against the\n\u201cglobal rich\u201d, would obviously fail to achieve their\nobjectives, indeed they would radically exacerbate the suffering of\nthose they aim to help. So they would be disproportionate, and cannot\nsatisfy the necessity constraint. The theoretical point that, in\nprinciple, not only national defence and humanitarian intervention\ncould give just causes for war is sound. But this example is in\npractice irrelevant (for a robust critique of redistributive\nwars, see Benbaji 2014).\n\nAnd yet, given the likely path of climate change, the future might see\nresource wars grow in salience. As powerful states find themselves\nlacking crucial resources, held by other states, we might find that\nmilitary attack is the best available means to secure these resources,\nand save lives. Perhaps in some such circumstances resource wars could\nbe a realistic option.\n",
