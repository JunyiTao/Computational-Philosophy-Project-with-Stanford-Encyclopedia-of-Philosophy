    "main_text": "Why does disability pose a problem for health care rationing? || Problematic scenarios at the individual level\n2.3 Problematic scenarios at the individual level\n\nIn this section we explore the ethical issues involved in health\nresource rationing involving disability at the individual level\n(leaving the ethics of rationing policy for the next section). For\nconcreteness, we look at allocation scenarios commonly used in the\nliterature to highlight the impact of disability on the allocation\nstrategy of CEA using the QALY metric to define health resource use\nbenefit, or to test other intuitions about non-utilitarian,\negalitarian principles of fair distribution. There are many, many\ndifferent variations on these examples that can be imagined to test\nour intuitions, but these will give a flavor of this form of\nphilosophical analysis. The cases are divided naturally into those in\nwhich life itself is at stake and those in which some non-fatal health\noutcome involving an improvement in functioning (stabilization of\nfunctioning, or prevention of further functional decline) is at\nstake.\n\nNote: For all the examples below, let A represent a person with\na disability and B and C persons without. We make no\nassumption about what kind or severity of disability is involved,\nexcept to remind ourselves that the underlying impairments may be\ntrivial (a congenital port wine stain on one\u2019s face), although\nsocially stigmatizing, or moderate (arthritic pain affecting\nmobility), or extremely severe (life-threatening blood pressure or\ncompromised lung function). We assume that A, B, and\nC ex post (before the resource is administered) all\nhave roughly the same health needs with respect to the proposed\ntreatment or resource use, although A may have other health\nneeds associated with her pre-existing disability.\n\nLife-saving cases:\n\n A has a shorter life expectancy, post-treatment than\nB, but the treatment will save the lives of both A and\nB.\n A and B have the same life expectancy\npost-treatment, but B will have a higher quality of life.\n A\u2019s disability is such that the chances that the\nlife-saving treatment will be wholly effective, or its potential for\npositive effect, are greatly diminished in comparison with\nB.\n Neither C nor B have pre-existing disabilities, but\npost-treatment we have good reason to believe that C will\nacquire a disability and B will not, and that disability will\neither lessen C\u2019s life expectancy, or quality of life, or\nboth.\n\n\nIn all of these scenarios, the CEA and QALY allocation strategy would\nprima facie favor the non-disabled individual B. Both\nthe priority and the indirect benefits problems are at work here.\nAlthough this result seems intuitively acceptable for case (iii),\nsince the treatment to A would be a total waste of a scarce\nresource, and unfair if B could benefit from it. But it is far\nless clear what we would say if the effectiveness of the treatment was\nless obviously compromised by the disability. As for cases (i), (ii)\nand (iv) the CEA analysis is at least troubling because the preference\nis based exclusively on A\u2019s (or for case iv),\nC\u2019s) disability, or ex ante quality of life. We\nmight not think it relevant what kind of life a person would live\nafter a medical treatment, and differences in life expectancy would\nonly be relevant if they were very stark\u2014say A would only\nlive a few weeks, but B several decades.\n\nHealth improvement cases:\n\n A\u2019s disability acts like a co-morbidity and reduces\nthe efficacy of the proposed treatment so that the treatment has a\nless quality of life-enhancing outcome for A than it does for\nB.\n A\u2019s disability makes the treatment more complex,\nextended and more costly than it is for B, even though the\nresulting outcomes may be identical.\n C and B have no pre-existing disabilities, but we\nknow that C will acquire one post-treatment and because of this\nthe quality of life-enhancing outcome will be less for C than\nfor B.\n\n\nFor cases (i) and (iii), primarily because of the use of QALY as a\nmetric for benefit, the standard strategy for health resource\nallocation would favor B over A or C: because of\ntheir disabilities, ex post or ex ante, individuals\nA and C have worst health resource use outcomes than\nB. As with the life-saving cases, our intuitions seem to depend\non how great the gap in quality of life is between A (or\nC) and B. Should A and C experience an\nextremely low quality of life after the treatment, while B\nexperience very high quality of life, then we are tempted to favor\nB; but when the differences are minimal, then favoring B\nover A seems arbitrary and unfair. The case of (ii) puts the\ndisadvantage on the cost rather than the benefit side, with the result\nthat CEA would favor B. Again, our intuitions here seem to be\naffected by magnitude: if the cost difference is trivial, then it\nseems unfair to favor B; if the differences are enormous, then\nour utilitarian intuitions seem more dominant and we would favor\nB. In general, once the subtleties of proportional benefit or\nproportional cost are considered, our intuitions are actually very\nfluid.\n",
